### [1] [A Real-Time Diminished Reality Approach to Privacy in MR Collaboration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10466)
*Christian Fane*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 实时减实系统，通过语义分割和实时修复技术，在混合现实会议中实现隐私保护，能够以20+fps的速度选择性移除敏感物品。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决共享空间混合现实会议中的隐私问题，让用户能够选择性移除个人或敏感物品，保护隐私不被其他参与者看到。

Method: 使用YOLOv11进行物体检测，改进的解耦时空变换器(DSTT)模型进行高质量视频修复，结合ZED 2i深度相机实现实时处理。

Result: 在720p分辨率下，系统能够维持超过20fps的帧率，实现了实时减实效果，无需固定观察视角或预先3D环境扫描。

Conclusion: 该系统证明了实时减实技术在隐私保护混合现实应用中的可行性，具有便携性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Diminished reality (DR) refers to the digital removal of real-world objects
by compositing background content in their place. This thesis presents a
real-time, inpainting-based DR system designed to enable privacy control in
shared-space mixed reality (MR) meetings. The system allows a primary headset
user to selectively remove personal or sensitive items from their environment,
ensuring that those objects are no longer visible to other participants.
Removal is achieved through semantic segmentation and precise object selection,
followed by real-time inpainting from the viewpoint of a secondary observer,
implemented using a mobile ZED 2i depth camera. The solution is designed to be
portable and robust, requiring neither a fixed secondary viewpoint nor prior 3D
scanning of the environment. The system utilises YOLOv11 for object detection
and a modified Decoupled Spatial-Temporal Transformer (DSTT) model for
high-quality video inpainting. At 720p resolution, the pipeline sustains frame
rates exceeding 20 fps, demonstrating the feasibility of real-time diminished
reality for practical privacy-preserving MR applications.

### [2] [SurgLaVi: Large-Scale Hierarchical Dataset for Surgical Vision-Language Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10555)
*Alejandra Perez,Chinedu Nwoye,Ramtin Raji Kermani,Omid Mohareri,Muhammad Abdullah Jamal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SurgLaVi是当前最大最丰富的手术视觉语言数据集，包含24万视频片段-文本对，覆盖200多种手术程序，具有分层标注结构。通过自动化流水线生成高质量标注，并发布了11.3万对的开源版本SurgLaVi-β。基于此数据集开发的SurgCLIP模型在多项手术任务中显著超越现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有手术视觉语言预训练数据集存在规模小、程序多样性不足、语义质量差和缺乏层次结构等问题，限制了手术VLP的发展。

Method: 开发了全自动流水线系统生成手术视频的细粒度转录，并将其分割为连贯的程序单元，采用双模态过滤去除噪声样本，构建层次化的手术视觉语言数据集。

Result: SurgLaVi数据集包含近24万视频片段-文本对，覆盖200+手术程序，具有阶段-步骤-任务三级层次结构。SurgCLIP模型在阶段、步骤、动作和工具识别等任务中 consistently 超越现有最佳方法。

Conclusion: 大规模、语义丰富且层次结构化的数据集能够直接转化为更强和更可泛化的表示，SurgLaVi为开发手术基础模型提供了关键资源。

Abstract: Vision-language pre-training (VLP) offers unique advantages for surgery by
aligning language with surgical videos, enabling workflow understanding and
transfer across tasks without relying on expert-labeled datasets. However,
progress in surgical VLP remains constrained by the limited scale, procedural
diversity, semantic quality, and hierarchical structure of existing datasets.
In this work, we present SurgLaVi, the largest and most diverse surgical
vision-language dataset to date, comprising nearly 240k clip-caption pairs from
more than 200 procedures, and comprising hierarchical levels at phase-, step-,
and task-level. At the core of SurgLaVi lies a fully automated pipeline that
systematically generates fine-grained transcriptions of surgical videos and
segments them into coherent procedural units. To ensure high-quality
annotations, it applies dual-modality filtering to remove irrelevant and noisy
samples. Within this framework, the resulting captions are enriched with
contextual detail, producing annotations that are both semantically rich and
easy to interpret. To ensure accessibility, we release SurgLaVi-\b{eta}, an
open-source derivative of 113k clip-caption pairs constructed entirely from
public data, which is over four times larger than existing surgical VLP
datasets. To demonstrate the value of SurgLaVi datasets, we introduce SurgCLIP,
a CLIP-style video-text contrastive framework with dual encoders, as a
representative base model. SurgCLIP achieves consistent improvements across
phase, step, action, and tool recognition, surpassing prior state-of-the-art
methods, often by large margins. These results validate that large-scale,
semantically rich, and hierarchically structured datasets directly translate
into stronger and more generalizable representations, establishing SurgLaVi as
a key resource for developing surgical foundation models.

### [3] [Building a General SimCLR Self-Supervised Foundation Model Across Neurological Diseases to Advance 3D Brain MRI Diagnoses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10620)
*Emily Kaczmarek,Justin Szeto,Brennan Nichyporuk,Tal Arbel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 基于SimCLR自监督学习的3D脑部MRI基础模型，在11个公开数据集上训练，在多个下游任务中超过MAE和监督学习基线模型，甚至在仅20%标签数据下仍有优异表现


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决3D脑部MRI分析中深度学习模型对特定任务的依赖性和汉化性问题，建立能够渗透多任务和人群的通用基础模型

Method: 使用SimCLR自监督学习方法，在11个公开数据集的18,759名患者（44,958张扫描）上进行预训练，涵盖多种神经系统疾病

Result: 在4个下游预测任务中（包括分布内和分布外设置）都超过了MAE和监督学习基线模型，在仅使用20%标签训练数据预测阿尔茫海默病时仍保持优异性能

Conclusion: 提供了一个高分辨率、广泛适用且可访问的3D脑部MRI分析基础模型，为临床脑部MRI分析做出了重要贡献

Abstract: 3D structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) brain scans are commonly
acquired in clinical settings to monitor a wide range of neurological
conditions, including neurodegenerative disorders and stroke. While deep
learning models have shown promising results analyzing 3D MRI across a number
of brain imaging tasks, most are highly tailored for specific tasks with
limited labeled data, and are not able to generalize across tasks and/or
populations. The development of self-supervised learning (SSL) has enabled the
creation of large medical foundation models that leverage diverse, unlabeled
datasets ranging from healthy to diseased data, showing significant success in
2D medical imaging applications. However, even the very few foundation models
for 3D brain MRI that have been developed remain limited in resolution, scope,
or accessibility. In this work, we present a general, high-resolution
SimCLR-based SSL foundation model for 3D brain structural MRI, pre-trained on
18,759 patients (44,958 scans) from 11 publicly available datasets spanning
diverse neurological diseases. We compare our model to Masked Autoencoders
(MAE), as well as two supervised baselines, on four diverse downstream
prediction tasks in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings. Our
fine-tuned SimCLR model outperforms all other models across all tasks. Notably,
our model still achieves superior performance when fine-tuned using only 20% of
labeled training samples for predicting Alzheimer's disease. We use publicly
available code and data, and release our trained model at
https://github.com/emilykaczmarek/3D-Neuro-SimCLR, contributing a broadly
applicable and accessible foundation model for clinical brain MRI analysis.

### [4] [USCTNet: A deep unfolding nuclear-norm optimization solver for physically consistent HSI reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10651)
*Xiaoyang Ma,Yiyang Chai,Xinran Qu,Hong Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: USCTNet是一个基于深度展开的RGB到高光谱图像重建方法，通过物理约束和可学习低秩正则化实现精确重建，在标准基准测试中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从单张RGB图像重建高光谱图像是一个病态问题，当相机光谱敏感性和场景光照信息不准确时会导致物理不一致性。现有方法缺乏对物理前向算子的显式建模和高效正则化策略。

Method: 提出物理约束的逆问题公式，使用可学习变换域中的核范数正则化；显式估计相机光谱敏感性和光照来定义前向算子；引入数据自适应的低秩子空间奇异值阈值算子避免完整SVD计算；开发USCTNet深度展开求解器，结合参数估计模块和可学习近端更新。

Result: 在标准基准测试中，相比最先进的RGB-based方法，在重建精度方面取得了持续改进。

Conclusion: USCTNet通过物理约束建模和高效正则化策略，成功解决了RGB到高光谱图像重建的物理一致性问题，在精度和计算效率方面都表现出色。

Abstract: Reconstructing hyperspectral images (HSIs) from a single RGB image is
ill-posed and can become physically inconsistent when the camera spectral
sensitivity (CSS) and scene illumination are misspecified. We formulate
RGB-to-HSI reconstruction as a physics-grounded inverse problem regularized by
a nuclear norm in a learnable transform domain, and we explicitly estimate CSS
and illumination to define the forward operator embedded in each iteration,
ensuring colorimetric consistency. To avoid the cost and instability of full
singular-value decompositions (SVDs) required by singular-value thresholding
(SVT), we introduce a data-adaptive low-rank subspace SVT operator. Building on
these components, we develop USCTNet, a deep unfolding solver tailored to HSI
that couples a parameter estimation module with learnable proximal updates.
Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks show consistent improvements over
state-of-the-art RGB-based methods in reconstruction accuracy. Code:

### [5] [A Comparison and Evaluation of Fine-tuned Convolutional Neural Networks to Large Language Models for Image Classification and Segmentation of Brain Tumors on MRI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10683)
*Felicia Liu,Jay J. Yoo,Farzad Khalvati*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究了大语言模型在医学影像任务中的性能，发现卷积神经网络在脑绊瘤分类和分割任务中都显著优于大语言模型，说明目前的LLM在图像基于的医学应用中尚不适用


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大语言模型在文本基于的健康卫生任务中表现强劲，但其在图像基于应用中的效用仍未得到探索，需要研究LLM在医学影像任务中的性能表现

Method: 使用BraTS 2020多模态脑部MRI数据集，评估通用视觉-语言大模型(LLaMA 3.2 Instruct)在精调前后的性能，并与自定义3D卷积神经网络进行对比，测试任务包括脑绊瘤分类(低级别vs高级别)和分割(中心点、边框、多边形提取)

Result: 在分类任务中，CNN达到80%准确率，通用LLM仅达到76%准确率且特异性只有18%，精调后特异性提升到55%但整体性能下降。在分割任务中，CNN能准确定位脑绊瘤，而LLM的预测一致聚集在图像中心附近，无法区分脑绊瘤的大小、位置和放置

Conclusion: 卷积神经网络在两个任务中都显著优于大语言模型，LLM展现出有限的空间理解能力且精调改善效果有限，说明目前的LLM在图像基于的医学任务中尚不适用，需要更严格的精调或替代训练策略才能获得更好的性能

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong performance in text-based
healthcare tasks. However, their utility in image-based applications remains
unexplored. We investigate the effectiveness of LLMs for medical imaging tasks,
specifically glioma classification and segmentation, and compare their
performance to that of traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Using
the BraTS 2020 dataset of multi-modal brain MRIs, we evaluated a
general-purpose vision-language LLM (LLaMA 3.2 Instruct) both before and after
fine-tuning, and benchmarked its performance against custom 3D CNNs. For glioma
classification (Low-Grade vs. High-Grade), the CNN achieved 80% accuracy and
balanced precision and recall. The general LLM reached 76% accuracy but
suffered from a specificity of only 18%, often misclassifying Low-Grade tumors.
Fine-tuning improved specificity to 55%, but overall performance declined
(e.g., accuracy dropped to 72%). For segmentation, three methods - center
point, bounding box, and polygon extraction, were implemented. CNNs accurately
localized gliomas, though small tumors were sometimes missed. In contrast, LLMs
consistently clustered predictions near the image center, with no distinction
of glioma size, location, or placement. Fine-tuning improved output formatting
but failed to meaningfully enhance spatial accuracy. The bounding polygon
method yielded random, unstructured outputs. Overall, CNNs outperformed LLMs in
both tasks. LLMs showed limited spatial understanding and minimal improvement
from fine-tuning, indicating that, in their current form, they are not
well-suited for image-based tasks. More rigorous fine-tuning or alternative
training strategies may be needed for LLMs to achieve better performance,
robustness, and utility in the medical space.

### [6] [Stable Part Diffusion 4D: Multi-View RGB and Kinematic Parts Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10687)
*Hao Zhang,Chun-Han Yao,Simon Donné,Narendra Ahuja,Varun Jampani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SP4D是一个从单目输入生成配对RGB和运动学部件视频的框架，通过双分支扩散模型联合合成RGB帧和部件分割图，采用空间颜色编码简化架构，并支持将2D部件图提升到3D骨骼结构


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统部件分割方法依赖基于外观的语义线索，SP4D旨在学习生成与物体关节对齐、在视角和时间上保持一致的动态运动学部件

Method: 采用双分支扩散模型，引入空间颜色编码将部件掩码映射到连续RGB图像，使用双向扩散融合模块增强跨分支一致性，配合对比部件一致性损失促进空间和时间对齐

Result: SP4D能够泛化到多样化场景，包括真实世界视频、新生成物体和罕见关节姿态，生成的运动感知输出适用于下游动画和运动相关任务

Conclusion: SP4D框架成功实现了从单目输入生成运动学一致的部件分割，为动画和运动分析任务提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: We present Stable Part Diffusion 4D (SP4D), a framework for generating paired
RGB and kinematic part videos from monocular inputs. Unlike conventional part
segmentation methods that rely on appearance-based semantic cues, SP4D learns
to produce kinematic parts - structural components aligned with object
articulation and consistent across views and time. SP4D adopts a dual-branch
diffusion model that jointly synthesizes RGB frames and corresponding part
segmentation maps. To simplify the architecture and flexibly enable different
part counts, we introduce a spatial color encoding scheme that maps part masks
to continuous RGB-like images. This encoding allows the segmentation branch to
share the latent VAE from the RGB branch, while enabling part segmentation to
be recovered via straightforward post-processing. A Bidirectional Diffusion
Fusion (BiDiFuse) module enhances cross-branch consistency, supported by a
contrastive part consistency loss to promote spatial and temporal alignment of
part predictions. We demonstrate that the generated 2D part maps can be lifted
to 3D to derive skeletal structures and harmonic skinning weights with few
manual adjustments. To train and evaluate SP4D, we construct KinematicParts20K,
a curated dataset of over 20K rigged objects selected and processed from
Objaverse XL (Deitke et al., 2023), each paired with multi-view RGB and part
video sequences. Experiments show that SP4D generalizes strongly to diverse
scenarios, including real-world videos, novel generated objects, and rare
articulated poses, producing kinematic-aware outputs suitable for downstream
animation and motion-related tasks.

### [7] [SegSLR: Promptable Video Segmentation for Isolated Sign Language Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10710)
*Sven Schreiber,Noha Sarhan,Simone Frintrop,Christian Wilms*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SegSLR是一个结合RGB和姿态信息的孤立手语识别系统，通过可提示的零样本视频分割技术，专注于手语者的身体和手部区域，在ChaLearn249 IsoGD数据集上超越了现有最先进方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的孤立手语识别方法主要依赖RGB数据或姿态信息，但结合这两种模态时往往会丢失关键细节（如手部形状和方向），因为不精确的表示（如边界框）导致信息损失。

Method: 提出SegSLR系统，利用姿态信息提供的粗略手部和身体定位，通过可提示的零样本视频分割技术分割相应部位，保持所有相关形状信息，然后将RGB数据处理集中在最相关的身体部位。

Result: 在复杂的ChaLearn249 IsoGD数据集上，SegSLR超越了最先进的方法。消融研究表明，系统通过专注于手语者的身体和手部获得了显著收益。

Conclusion: SegSLR通过有效结合RGB和姿态信息，专注于关键身体部位的分割处理，提高了孤立手语识别的性能，证明了该设计选择的有效性。

Abstract: Isolated Sign Language Recognition (ISLR) approaches primarily rely on RGB
data or signer pose information. However, combining these modalities often
results in the loss of crucial details, such as hand shape and orientation, due
to imprecise representations like bounding boxes. Therefore, we propose the
ISLR system SegSLR, which combines RGB and pose information through promptable
zero-shot video segmentation. Given the rough localization of the hands and the
signer's body from pose information, we segment the respective parts through
the video to maintain all relevant shape information. Subsequently, the
segmentations focus the processing of the RGB data on the most relevant body
parts for ISLR. This effectively combines RGB and pose information. Our
evaluation on the complex ChaLearn249 IsoGD dataset shows that SegSLR
outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, ablation studies indicate
that SegSLR strongly benefits from focusing on the signer's body and hands,
justifying our design choices.

*Jecia Z. Y. Mao,Francis X Creighton,Russell H Taylor,Manish Sahu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了SCOPE框架，结合大语言模型的推理能力和视觉基础模型的感知能力，通过语音引导实现手术场景的实时分割、标记和跟踪。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前手术场景分割方案依赖于特定领域的监督模型，需要标注数据和领域特定数据，无法适应新的手术场景和预定义标签类别之外的场景。现有视觉基础模型虽然支持零样本分割，但依赖手动视觉或文本提示，限制了在手术环境中的部署。

Method: SCOPE框架整合大语言模型的推理能力和开放集视觉基础模型的感知能力，通过协作感知代理生成分割候选，并整合临床医生的语音反馈来指导手术器械分割。利用器械作为交互指针标记手术场景的其他元素。

Result: 在公开Cataract1k数据集和内部离体颅底数据集上验证了框架的有效性，能够生成手术场景的实时分割和跟踪。通过现场模拟离体实验展示了动态能力。

Conclusion: 这种人类-AI协作范式展示了开发适用于动态手术室环境的适应性、免提、以外科医生为中心的工具的潜力。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation and tracking of relevant elements of the surgical scene
is crucial to enable context-aware intraoperative assistance and decision
making. Current solutions remain tethered to domain-specific, supervised models
that rely on labeled data and required domain-specific data to adapt to new
surgical scenarios and beyond predefined label categories. Recent advances in
prompt-driven vision foundation models (VFM) have enabled open-set, zero-shot
segmentation across heterogeneous medical images. However, dependence of these
models on manual visual or textual cues restricts their deployment in
introperative surgical settings. We introduce a speech-guided collaborative
perception (SCOPE) framework that integrates reasoning capabilities of large
language model (LLM) with perception capabilities of open-set VFMs to support
on-the-fly segmentation, labeling and tracking of surgical instruments and
anatomy in intraoperative video streams. A key component of this framework is a
collaborative perception agent, which generates top candidates of VFM-generated
segmentation and incorporates intuitive speech feedback from clinicians to
guide the segmentation of surgical instruments in a natural human-machine
collaboration paradigm. Afterwards, instruments themselves serve as interactive
pointers to label additional elements of the surgical scene. We evaluated our
proposed framework on a subset of publicly available Cataract1k dataset and an
in-house ex-vivo skull-base dataset to demonstrate its potential to generate
on-the-fly segmentation and tracking of surgical scene. Furthermore, we
demonstrate its dynamic capabilities through a live mock ex-vivo experiment.
This human-AI collaboration paradigm showcase the potential of developing
adaptable, hands-free, surgeon-centric tools for dynamic operating-room
environments.

*Yi-Ruei Liu,You-Zhe Xie,Yu-Hsiang Hsu,I-Sheng Fang,Yu-Lun Liu,Jun-Cheng Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 4D-GRT是一个新颖的两阶段流水线，结合4D高斯溅射和基于物理的光线追踪来模拟相机效果，解决了传统计算机视觉系统在真实相机效应下的失效问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统计算机视觉系统假设理想针孔相机，但在面对鱼眼畸变、滚动快门等真实相机效应时会失效，主要原因是缺乏包含相机效应的训练数据。现有数据生成方法存在成本高、模拟到现实的差距或无法准确建模相机效应的问题。

Method: 提出4D高斯光线追踪(4D-GRT)两阶段流水线：首先通过多视角视频重建动态场景，然后应用基于物理的光线追踪生成具有可控、物理准确的相机效应的视频。

Result: 4D-GRT实现了最快的渲染速度，同时在渲染质量上优于或与现有基线方法相当。还构建了包含8个合成动态场景的基准数据集，涵盖4种相机效应。

Conclusion: 4D-GRT提供了一种高效、准确的相机效应模拟方法，解决了计算机视觉系统在真实相机效应下的数据生成瓶颈问题。

Abstract: Common computer vision systems typically assume ideal pinhole cameras but
fail when facing real-world camera effects such as fisheye distortion and
rolling shutter, mainly due to the lack of learning from training data with
camera effects. Existing data generation approaches suffer from either high
costs, sim-to-real gaps or fail to accurately model camera effects. To address
this bottleneck, we propose 4D Gaussian Ray Tracing (4D-GRT), a novel two-stage
pipeline that combines 4D Gaussian Splatting with physically-based ray tracing
for camera effect simulation. Given multi-view videos, 4D-GRT first
reconstructs dynamic scenes, then applies ray tracing to generate videos with
controllable, physically accurate camera effects. 4D-GRT achieves the fastest
rendering speed while performing better or comparable rendering quality
compared to existing baselines. Additionally, we construct eight synthetic
dynamic scenes in indoor environments across four camera effects as a benchmark
to evaluate generated videos with camera effects.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出多智能体视频编辑系统，通过Editor和Critic智能体协作，使用自然语言指令自动完成视频编辑任务，在覆盖度、时间约束和人类偏好方面显著优于现有方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动化视频编辑工具在电影制作、广告和社交媒体内容创作中有广泛应用需求，但现有工作主要关注检索或用户界面，将实际编辑任务留给用户

Method: 多智能体方法：设计Editor智能体（使用视频编辑软件工具处理视频剪辑和自然语言指令）和Critic智能体（提供自然语言反馈或渲染满意结果）；基于学习的方法实现专业智能体间的有效通信；使用LLM-as-a-judge评估指标

Result: 通过用户研究定性和定量评估，系统在覆盖度、时间约束满足度和人类偏好方面大幅超越现有方法

Conclusion: 提出的多智能体视频编辑系统成功实现了语言驱动的自动化视频编辑，为解决核心视频编辑任务提供了有效方案

Abstract: Automated tools for video editing and assembly have applications ranging from
filmmaking and advertisement to content creation for social media. Previous
video editing work has mainly focused on either retrieval or user interfaces,
leaving actual editing to the user. In contrast, we propose to automate the
core task of video editing, formulating it as sequential decision making
process. Ours is a multi-agent approach. We design an Editor agent and a Critic
agent. The Editor takes as input a collection of video clips together with
natural language instructions and uses tools commonly found in video editing
software to produce an edited sequence. On the other hand, the Critic gives
natural language feedback to the editor based on the produced sequence or
renders it if it is satisfactory. We introduce a learning-based approach for
enabling effective communication across specialized agents to address the
language-driven video editing task. Finally, we explore an LLM-as-a-judge
metric for evaluating the quality of video editing system and compare it with
general human preference. We evaluate our system's output video sequences
qualitatively and quantitatively through a user study and find that our system
vastly outperforms existing approaches in terms of coverage, time constraint
satisfaction, and human preference.

TL;DR: 通过机器学习框架从非对比增强MRI预测脑米粒细胞瘤对比强化，减少对鐐基对比剂的依赖，提高多中心预测稳定性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 鐐基对比剂(GBCAs)存在安全性、成本和可访问性问题，而对比强化反映脾瘤恶性程度并指导治疗决策

Method: 分析1,446例脑米瘤从四个数据集，提取108个特征，组合48种降维方法和25个分类器构成1,200个流水线，采用旋转验证进行多中心测试

Result: 交叉验证准确率0.91-0.96，外部测试平均0.93，F1、精确度和召回率稳定(0.87-0.96)，MI联合ETr流水线表现最优

Conclusion: 稳定性感知模型选择能够实现可靠的对比强化预测，减少对GBCAs的依赖，提高多中心通用性，为神经脾瘤学领域提供可扩展模板

Abstract: Gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) are central to glioma imaging but
raise safety, cost, and accessibility concerns. Predicting contrast enhancement
from non-contrast MRI using machine learning (ML) offers a safer alternative,
as enhancement reflects tumor aggressiveness and informs treatment planning.
Yet scanner and cohort variability hinder robust model selection. We propose a
stability-aware framework to identify reproducible ML pipelines for multicenter
prediction of glioma MRI contrast enhancement. We analyzed 1,446 glioma cases
from four TCIA datasets (UCSF-PDGM, UPENN-GB, BRATS-Africa, BRATS-TCGA-LGG).
Non-contrast T1WI served as input, with enhancement derived from paired
post-contrast T1WI. Using PyRadiomics under IBSI standards, 108 features were
extracted and combined with 48 dimensionality reduction methods and 25
classifiers, yielding 1,200 pipelines. Rotational validation was trained on
three datasets and tested on the fourth. Cross-validation prediction accuracies
ranged from 0.91 to 0.96, with external testing achieving 0.87 (UCSF-PDGM),
0.98 (UPENN-GB), and 0.95 (BRATS-Africa), with an average of 0.93. F1,
precision, and recall were stable (0.87 to 0.96), while ROC-AUC varied more
widely (0.50 to 0.82), reflecting cohort heterogeneity. The MI linked with ETr
pipeline consistently ranked highest, balancing accuracy and stability. This
framework demonstrates that stability-aware model selection enables reliable
prediction of contrast enhancement from non-contrast glioma MRI, reducing
reliance on GBCAs and improving generalizability across centers. It provides a
scalable template for reproducible ML in neuro-oncology and beyond.

*Yilun Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种与检测器无关的后处理框架，通过重叠刻片恢复低信心度候选目标，空间和语义门控验证组织证据，并通过信心度重新加权提高检测回率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决UAV图像中密集小目标因远离视角、遮挡和杂乱而被漏检的问题。

Method: 重叠刻片恢复低信心度候选目标，空间门（基于框中心DBSCAN）和语义门（基于ResNet-18嵌入DBSCAN）验证组织证据，经过信心度重新加权后进行类别敏感NMS融合。

Result: 在VisDrone数据集上回率从0.685提升到0.778（+​​0.093），精确度从0.801调整到0.595，F1分数为0.669，后处理延迟平均0.095秒每弹。

Conclusion: 该框架展现了优先提升回率、交换精确度的行为，适用于远场计数和监控等回率敏感应用，无需重新训练且可与现代检测器集成。

Abstract: Dense small objects in UAV imagery are often missed due to long-range
viewpoints, occlusion, and clutter[cite: 5]. This paper presents a
detector-agnostic post-processing framework that converts overlap-induced
redundancy into group evidence[cite: 6]. Overlapping tiling first recovers
low-confidence candidates[cite: 7]. A Spatial Gate (DBSCAN on box centroids)
and a Semantic Gate (DBSCAN on ResNet-18 embeddings) then validates group
evidence[cite: 7]. Validated groups receive controlled confidence reweighting
before class-aware NMS fusion[cite: 8]. Experiments on VisDrone show a recall
increase from 0.685 to 0.778 (+0.093) and a precision adjustment from 0.801 to
0.595, yielding F1=0.669[cite: 9]. Post-processing latency averages 0.095 s per
image[cite: 10]. These results indicate recall-first, precision-trade-off
behavior that benefits recall-sensitive applications such as far-field counting
and monitoring[cite: 10]. Ablation confirms that tiling exposes missed objects,
spatial clustering stabilizes geometry, semantic clustering enforces appearance
coherence, and reweighting provides calibrated integration with the
baseline[cite: 11]. The framework requires no retraining and integrates with

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InternScenes是一个大规模可模拟室内场景数据集，包含约40,000个多样化场景、196万个3D物体，涵盖15种场景类型和288个物体类别，解决了现有数据集在规模、多样性和布局真实性方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D场景数据集存在规模有限、多样性不足、布局过于简化（缺乏小物品）以及严重物体碰撞等问题，限制了具身AI的发展。

Method: 整合三种不同场景来源（真实扫描、程序生成、设计师创建），通过数据处理流水线确保可模拟性，创建真实到模拟的复制品，增加交互性物体，并通过物理模拟解决物体碰撞问题。

Result: 构建了包含41.5个物体/区域的复杂真实布局，在场景布局生成和点目标导航两个基准应用中展示了新挑战，并为模型训练规模化提供了可能。

Conclusion: InternScenes为复杂场景中的生成和导航任务铺平了道路，承诺开源数据、模型和基准测试以惠及整个研究社区。

Abstract: The advancement of Embodied AI heavily relies on large-scale, simulatable 3D
scene datasets characterized by scene diversity and realistic layouts. However,
existing datasets typically suffer from limitations in data scale or diversity,
sanitized layouts lacking small items, and severe object collisions. To address
these shortcomings, we introduce \textbf{InternScenes}, a novel large-scale
simulatable indoor scene dataset comprising approximately 40,000 diverse scenes
by integrating three disparate scene sources, real-world scans, procedurally
generated scenes, and designer-created scenes, including 1.96M 3D objects and
covering 15 common scene types and 288 object classes. We particularly preserve
massive small items in the scenes, resulting in realistic and complex layouts
with an average of 41.5 objects per region. Our comprehensive data processing
pipeline ensures simulatability by creating real-to-sim replicas for real-world
scans, enhances interactivity by incorporating interactive objects into these
scenes, and resolves object collisions by physical simulations. We demonstrate
the value of InternScenes with two benchmark applications: scene layout
generation and point-goal navigation. Both show the new challenges posed by the
complex and realistic layouts. More importantly, InternScenes paves the way for
scaling up the model training for both tasks, making the generation and
navigation in such complex scenes possible. We commit to open-sourcing the
data, models, and benchmarks to benefit the whole community.

Abstract: Previous work has made use of a parameterized plane curve polynomial
representation for mathematical handwriting, with the polynomials represented
in a Legendre or Legendre-Sobolev graded basis. This provides a compact
geometric representation for the digital ink. Preliminary results have also
been shown for Chebyshev and Chebyshev-Sobolev bases. This article explores the
trade-offs between basis choice and polynomial degree to achieve accurate
modeling with a low computational cost. To do this, we consider the condition
number for polynomial evaluation in these bases and bound how the various inner
products give norms for the variations between symbols.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了临床MRI数据稀疏和不完整的问题，提供了灵活的时间依赖肿瘤进展预测能力，为脑绊瘤的临床管理提供了有价值的工具。

Abstract: Glioma, an aggressive brain malignancy characterized by rapid progression and
its poor prognosis, poses significant challenges for accurate evolution
prediction. These challenges are exacerbated by sparse, irregularly acquired
longitudinal MRI data in clinical practice, where incomplete follow-up
sequences create data imbalances and make reliable modeling difficult. In this
paper, we present a multitask diffusion framework for time-agnostic, pixel-wise
prediction of glioma progression. The model simultaneously generates future
FLAIR sequences at any chosen time point and estimates spatial probabilistic
tumor evolution maps derived using signed distance fields (SDFs), allowing
uncertainty quantification. To capture temporal dynamics of tumor evolution
across arbitrary intervals, we integrate a pretrained deformation module that
models inter-scan changes using deformation fields. Regarding the common
clinical limitation of data scarcity, we implement a targeted augmentation
pipeline that synthesizes complete sequences of three follow-up scans and
imputes missing MRI modalities from available patient studies, improving the
stability and accuracy of predictive models. Based on merely two follow-up
scans at earlier timepoints, our framework produces flexible time-depending
probability maps, enabling clinicians to interrogate tumor progression risks at
any future temporal milestone. We further introduce a radiotherapy-weighted
focal loss term that leverages radiation dose maps, as these highlight regions
of greater clinical importance during model training. The proposed method was
trained on a public dataset and evaluated on an internal private dataset,
achieving promising results in both cases

Result: 在数据稀缺场景下取得显著性能提升，同时在SemanticKITTI和PandaSet两个标准数据集上达到有竞争力的结果

Conclusion: 该方法通过点-平面投影和几何感知增强，有效提升了点云语义分割性能，特别是在数据有限的情况下，为3D环境理解提供了实用解决方案

Abstract: LiDAR point cloud semantic segmentation is essential for interpreting 3D
environments in applications such as autonomous driving and robotics. Recent
methods achieve strong performance by exploiting different point cloud
representations or incorporating data from other sensors, such as cameras or
external datasets. However, these approaches often suffer from high
computational complexity and require large amounts of training data, limiting
their generalization in data-scarce scenarios. In this paper, we improve the
performance of point-based methods by effectively learning features from 2D
representations through point-plane projections, enabling the extraction of
complementary information while relying solely on LiDAR data. Additionally, we
introduce a geometry-aware technique for data augmentation that aligns with
LiDAR sensor properties and mitigates class imbalance. We implemented and
evaluated our method that applies point-plane projections onto multiple
informative 2D representations of the point cloud. Experiments demonstrate that
this approach leads to significant improvements in limited-data scenarios,
while also achieving competitive results on two publicly available standard
datasets, as SemanticKITTI and PandaSet. The code of our method is available at

Conclusion: OpenUrban3D为3D城市场景理解提供了一个灵活且可扩展的解决方案，能够处理任意文本查询的零样本分割任务。

Abstract: Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation enables models to recognize and segment
objects from arbitrary natural language descriptions, offering the flexibility
to handle novel, fine-grained, or functionally defined categories beyond fixed
label sets. While this capability is crucial for large-scale urban point clouds
that support applications such as digital twins, smart city management, and
urban analytics, it remains largely unexplored in this domain. The main
obstacles are the frequent absence of high-quality, well-aligned multi-view
imagery in large-scale urban point cloud datasets and the poor generalization
of existing three-dimensional (3D) segmentation pipelines across diverse urban
environments with substantial variation in geometry, scale, and appearance. To
address these challenges, we present OpenUrban3D, the first 3D open-vocabulary
semantic segmentation framework for large-scale urban scenes that operates
without aligned multi-view images, pre-trained point cloud segmentation
networks, or manual annotations. Our approach generates robust semantic
features directly from raw point clouds through multi-view, multi-granularity
rendering, mask-level vision-language feature extraction, and sample-balanced
fusion, followed by distillation into a 3D backbone model. This design enables
zero-shot segmentation for arbitrary text queries while capturing both semantic
richness and geometric priors. Extensive experiments on large-scale urban
benchmarks, including SensatUrban and SUM, show that OpenUrban3D achieves
significant improvements in both segmentation accuracy and cross-scene
generalization over existing methods, demonstrating its potential as a flexible
and scalable solution for 3D urban scene understanding.

Conclusion: AutoOEP是有效且资源高效的自动监考解决方案，能大幅提升在线考试的完整性

Abstract: The burgeoning of online education has created an urgent need for robust and
scalable systems to ensure academic integrity during remote examinations.
Traditional human proctoring is often not feasible at scale, while existing
automated solutions can be intrusive or fail to detect a wide range of cheating
behaviors. This paper introduces AutoOEP (Automated Online Exam Proctoring), a
comprehensive, multi-modal framework that leverages computer vision and machine
learning to provide effective, automated proctoring. The system utilizes a
dual-camera setup to capture both a frontal view of the examinee and a side
view of the workspace, minimizing blind spots. Our approach integrates several
parallel analyses: the Face Module performs continuous identity verification
using ArcFace, along with head pose estimation, gaze tracking, and mouth
movement analysis to detect suspicious cues. Concurrently, the Hand Module
employs a fine-tuned YOLOv11 model for detecting prohibited items (e.g., mobile
phones, notes) and tracks hand proximity to these objects. Features from these
modules are aggregated and fed into a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network
that analyzes temporal patterns to calculate a real-time cheating probability
score. We evaluate AutoOEP on a custom-collected dataset simulating diverse
exam conditions. Our system achieves an accuracy of 90.7% in classifying
suspicious activities. The object detection component obtains a mean Average
Precision (mAP@.5) of 0.57 for prohibited items, and the entire framework
processes video streams at approximately 2.4 frames per second without a GPU.
The results demonstrate that AutoOEP is an effective and resource-efficient
solution for automated proctoring, significantly reducing the need for human
intervention and enhancing the integrity of online assessments.

Conclusion: 该框架成功解决了CASSI重建中的性能与可解释性平衡问题，通过TV亚梯度理论和多相机空间先验的融合，为光谱成像提供了数学严谨且性能优越的解决方案。

Abstract: Spectral imaging technology has long-faced fundamental challenges in
balancing spectral, spatial, and temporal resolutions. While compressive
sensing-based Coded Aperture Snapshot Spectral Imaging (CASSI) mitigates this
trade-off through optical encoding, high compression ratios result in ill-posed
reconstruction problems. Traditional model-based methods exhibit limited
performance due to reliance on handcrafted inherent image priors, while deep
learning approaches are constrained by their black-box nature, which
compromises physical interpretability. To address these limitations, we propose
a dual-camera CASSI reconstruction framework that integrates total variation
(TV) subgradient theory. By establishing an end-to-end SD-CASSI mathematical
model, we reduce the computational complexity of solving the inverse problem
and provide a mathematically well-founded framework for analyzing multi-camera
systems. A dynamic regularization strategy is introduced, incorporating
normalized gradient constraints from RGB/panchromatic-derived reference images,
which constructs a TV subgradient similarity function with strict convex
optimization guarantees. Leveraging spatial priors from auxiliary cameras, an
adaptive reference generation and updating mechanism is designed to provide
subgradient guidance. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method
effectively preserves spatial-spectral structural consistency. The theoretical
framework establishes an interpretable mathematical foundation for
computational spectral imaging, demonstrating robust performance across diverse
reconstruction scenarios. The source code is available at

Result: 在BigEarthNet-Landsat数据集上预训练后，该模型虽然小很多，但与更大结构竞争。在缺乏显式元数据的EuroSAT-Landsat数据集上仍然表现竞争力

Conclusion: 简洁、元数据感知的MoE-MAE模型是向未来EO基础模型发展的高效可扩展步骤

Abstract: Recent advances in Earth Observation have focused on large-scale foundation
models. However, these models are computationally expensive, limiting their
accessibility and reuse for downstream tasks. In this work, we investigate
compact architectures as a practical pathway toward smaller general-purpose EO
models. We propose a Metadata-aware Mixture-of-Experts Masked Autoencoder
(MoE-MAE) with only 2.5M parameters. The model combines sparse expert routing
with geo-temporal conditioning, incorporating imagery alongside
latitude/longitude and seasonal/daily cyclic encodings. We pretrain the MoE-MAE
on the BigEarthNet-Landsat dataset and evaluate embeddings from its frozen
encoder using linear probes. Despite its small size, the model competes with
much larger architectures, demonstrating that metadata-aware pretraining
improves transfer and label efficiency. To further assess generalization, we
evaluate on the EuroSAT-Landsat dataset, which lacks explicit metadata, and
still observe competitive performance compared to models with hundreds of
millions of parameters. These results suggest that compact, metadata-aware
MoE-MAEs are an efficient and scalable step toward future EO foundation models.

Motivation: 解决HR-pQCT图像中的轻微运动伪影问题，这些伪影影响骨微结构的准确评估，但因缺乏标准化的退化模型而无法进行有效的运动罚正

Method: 优化正弦图基于运动伪影模拟方法，构建训练数据集；提出ESWGAN-GP模型，结合边缘增强跳连接和自注意力机制，使用VGG感知损失重建细微结构

Result: 在模拟数据集上达到SNR 26.78、SSIM 0.81、VIF 0.76；在实际数据集上进一步提升到SNR 29.31、SSIM 0.87、VIF 0.81

Conclusion: 虽然模拟的运动伪影可能简化了实际情况，但这些方法为实现深度学习基于运动罚正提供了重要的初步

Abstract: Rigid-motion artifacts, such as cortical bone streaking and trabecular
smearing, hinder in vivo assessment of bone microstructures in high-resolution
peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT). Despite various motion
grading techniques, no motion correction methods exist due to the lack of
standardized degradation models. We optimize a conventional sinogram-based
method to simulate motion artifacts in HR-pQCT images, creating paired datasets
of motion-corrupted images and their corresponding ground truth, which enables
seamless integration into supervised learning frameworks for motion correction.
As such, we propose an Edge-enhanced Self-attention Wasserstein Generative
Adversarial Network with Gradient Penalty (ESWGAN-GP) to address motion
artifacts in both simulated (source) and real-world (target) datasets. The
model incorporates edge-enhancing skip connections to preserve trabecular edges
and self-attention mechanisms to capture long-range dependencies, facilitating
motion correction. A visual geometry group (VGG)-based perceptual loss is used
to reconstruct fine micro-structural features. The ESWGAN-GP achieves a mean
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 26.78, structural similarity index measure
(SSIM) of 0.81, and visual information fidelity (VIF) of 0.76 for the source
dataset, while showing improved performance on the target dataset with an SNR
of 29.31, SSIM of 0.87, and VIF of 0.81. The proposed methods address a
simplified representation of real-world motion that may not fully capture the
complexity of in vivo motion artifacts. Nevertheless, because motion artifacts
present one of the foremost challenges to more widespread adoption of this
modality, these methods represent an important initial step toward implementing
deep learning-based motion correction in HR-pQCT.

Abstract: This paper examines the key factors that influence the performance of
state-of-the-art gaze-based authentication. Experiments were conducted on a
large-scale, in-house dataset comprising 8,849 subjects collected with Meta
Quest Pro equivalent hardware running a video oculography-driven gaze
estimation pipeline at 72Hz. The state-of-the-art neural network architecture
was employed to study the influence of the following factors on authentication
performance: eye tracking signal quality, various aspects of eye tracking
calibration, and simple filtering on estimated raw gaze. We found that using
the same calibration target depth for eye tracking calibration, fusing
calibrated and non-calibrated gaze, and improving eye tracking signal quality
all enhance authentication performance. We also found that a simple
three-sample moving average filter slightly reduces authentication performance
in general. While these findings hold true for the most part, some exceptions
were noted.

Result: 发现现有模型存在显著偏见：LMMs倾向于将中间肤色误分类为较浅肤色，生成模型在受到提示中无关属性（如发型或环境背景）的固有偏见影响时难以准确生成指定肤色。使用TrueSkin训练可将分类准确率提高20%以上，微调后显著改善生成模型的肤色保真度。

Conclusion: 研究强调了像TrueSkin这样的综合数据集的必要性，它不仅可作为评估现有模型的基准，还为提高肤色识别和生成任务的公平性和准确性提供了宝贵的训练资源。

Abstract: Skin tone recognition and generation play important roles in model fairness,
healthcare, and generative AI, yet they remain challenging due to the lack of
comprehensive datasets and robust methodologies. Compared to other human image
analysis tasks, state-of-the-art large multimodal models (LMMs) and image
generation models struggle to recognize and synthesize skin tones accurately.
To address this, we introduce TrueSkin, a dataset with 7299 images
systematically categorized into 6 classes, collected under diverse lighting
conditions, camera angles, and capture settings. Using TrueSkin, we benchmark
existing recognition and generation approaches, revealing substantial biases:
LMMs tend to misclassify intermediate skin tones as lighter ones, whereas
generative models struggle to accurately produce specified skin tones when
influenced by inherent biases from unrelated attributes in the prompts, such as
hairstyle or environmental context. We further demonstrate that training a
recognition model on TrueSkin improves classification accuracy by more than
20\% compared to LMMs and conventional approaches, and fine-tuning with
TrueSkin significantly improves skin tone fidelity in image generation models.
Our findings highlight the need for comprehensive datasets like TrueSkin, which
not only serves as a benchmark for evaluating existing models but also provides
a valuable training resource to enhance fairness and accuracy in skin tone
recognition and generation tasks.

Abstract: Animal health monitoring and population management are critical aspects of
wildlife conservation and livestock management that increasingly rely on
automated detection and tracking systems. While Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)
based systems combined with computer vision offer promising solutions for
non-invasive animal monitoring across challenging terrains, limited
availability of labeled training data remains an obstacle in developing
effective deep learning (DL) models for these applications. Transfer learning
has emerged as a potential solution, allowing models trained on large datasets
to be adapted for resource-limited scenarios such as those with limited data.
However, the vast landscape of pre-trained neural network architectures makes
it challenging to select optimal models, particularly for researchers new to
the field. In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL)-based
transfer learning framework that employs an upper confidence bound (UCB)
algorithm to automatically select the most suitable pre-trained model for
animal detection tasks. Our approach systematically evaluates and ranks
candidate models based on their performance, streamlining the model selection
process. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework achieves a higher
detection rate while requiring significantly less computational time compared
to traditional methods.

Abstract: The FungiCLEF 2025 competition addresses the challenge of automatic fungal
species recognition using realistic, field-collected observational data.
Accurate identification tools support both mycologists and citizen scientists,
greatly enhancing large-scale biodiversity monitoring. Effective recognition
systems in this context must handle highly imbalanced class distributions and
provide reliable performance even when very few training samples are available
for many species, especially rare and under-documented taxa that are often
missing from standard training sets. According to competition organizers, about
20\% of all verified fungi observations, representing nearly 20,000 instances,
are associated with these rarely recorded species. To tackle this challenge, we
propose a robust deep learning method based on prototypical networks, which
enhances prototype representations for few-shot fungal classification. Our
prototypical network approach exceeds the competition baseline by more than 30
percentage points in Recall@5 on both the public (PB) and private (PR)
leaderboards. This demonstrates strong potential for accurately identifying
both common and rare fungal species, supporting the main objectives of

TL;DR: 提出csMIL框架，通过聚类和稀疏正则化解决多示例学习中实例冗余问题，在病理图像分析中实现更好的性能和可解释性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MIL方法在处理无序实例集合时存在实例冗余问题，缺乏有效机制来丢弃非信息性实例，限制了模型的鲁棒性和可解释性

Method: csMIL框架包含全局-局部实例聚类、簇内注意力机制和簇级稀疏正则化，通过选择性保留诊断相关簇来提升性能

Result: 理论分析显示csMIL仅需O(s log K)个包即可恢复s个相关簇，在CAMELYON16和TCGA-NSCLC数据集上达到最先进性能

Conclusion: csMIL通过聚类和稀疏化有效解决了MIL中的实例冗余问题，提高了模型鲁棒性、可解释性并降低了计算复杂度

Abstract: Multi-Instance Learning (MIL) is pivotal for analyzing complex, weakly
labeled datasets, such as whole-slide images (WSIs) in computational pathology,
where bags comprise unordered collections of instances with sparse diagnostic
relevance. Traditional MIL approaches, including early statistical methods and
recent attention-based frameworks, struggle with instance redundancy and lack
explicit mechanisms for discarding non-informative instances, limiting their
robustness and interpretability. We propose Cluster-level Sparse MIL (csMIL), a
novel framework that integrates global-local instance clustering,
within-cluster attention, and cluster-level sparsity induction to address these
challenges. Our csMIL first performs global clustering across all bags to
establish $K$ cluster centers, followed by local clustering within each bag to
assign cluster labels. Attention scores are computed within each cluster, and
sparse regularization is applied to cluster weights, enabling the selective
retention of diagnostically relevant clusters while discarding irrelevant ones.
This approach enhances robustness to noisy instances, improves interpretability
by identifying critical regions, and reduces computational complexity.
Theoretical analysis demonstrates that csMIL requires $O(s log K)$ bags to
recover $s$ relevant clusters, aligning with compressed sensing principles.
Empirically, csMIL achieves state-of-the-art performance on two public
histopathology benchmarks (CAMELYON16, TCGA-NSCLC).

TL;DR: 基于骨架数据的零样本视频异常检测方法，通过动作典型性和唯一性学习，在未见监控场景上实现了独创的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 零样本视频异常检测在数据隐私和新监控部署中具有重要价值，骨架方法具有内在的可推广优势，但现有方法学习低级表征且依赖域限制的正常性边界

Method: 提出两个模块：1)语言导向的语义典型性建模模块，将骨架片段投影到动作语义空间并获取LLM的典型行为知识；2)测试时上下文唯一性分析模块，细致分析骨架片段的时空差异并得出场景适配边界

Conclusion: 该方法通过结合语义典型性学习和上下文唯一性分析，有效解锁了骨架数据在零样本异常检测中的潜力，实现了在未见场景上的良好推广性

Abstract: Zero-Shot Video Anomaly Detection (ZS-VAD) requires temporally localizing
anomalies without target domain training data, which is a crucial task due to
various practical concerns, e.g., data privacy or new surveillance deployments.
Skeleton-based approach has inherent generalizable advantages in achieving
ZS-VAD as it eliminates domain disparities both in background and human
appearance. However, existing methods only learn low-level skeleton
representation and rely on the domain-limited normality boundary, which cannot
generalize well to new scenes with different normal and abnormal behavior
patterns. In this paper, we propose a novel zero-shot video anomaly detection
framework, unlocking the potential of skeleton data via action typicality and
uniqueness learning. Firstly, we introduce a language-guided semantic
typicality modeling module that projects skeleton snippets into action semantic
space and distills LLM's knowledge of typical normal and abnormal behaviors
during training. Secondly, we propose a test-time context uniqueness analysis
module to finely analyze the spatio-temporal differences between skeleton
snippets and then derive scene-adaptive boundaries. Without using any training
samples from the target domain, our method achieves state-of-the-art results
against skeleton-based methods on four large-scale VAD datasets: ShanghaiTech,
UBnormal, NWPU, and UCF-Crime, featuring over 100 unseen surveillance scenes.

Abstract: Recent advances in organoid models have revolutionized the study of human
kidney disease mechanisms and drug discovery by enabling scalable,
cost-effective research without the need for animal sacrifice. Here, we present
a kidney organoid platform optimized for efficient screening in polycystic
kidney disease (PKD). While these systems generate rich spatial-temporal
microscopy video datasets, current manual approaches to analysis remain limited
to coarse classifications (e.g., hit vs. non-hit), often missing valuable
pixel-level and longitudinal information. To help overcome this bottleneck, we
developed Organoid Tracker, a graphical user interface (GUI) platform designed
with a modular plugin architecture, which empowers researchers to extract
detailed, quantitative metrics without programming expertise. Built on the
cutting-edge vision foundation model Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2), Organoid
Tracker enables zero-shot segmentation and automated analysis of
spatial-temporal microscopy videos. It quantifies key metrics such as cyst
formation rate, growth velocity, and morphological changes, while generating
comprehensive reports. By providing an extensible, open-source framework,
Organoid Tracker offers a powerful solution for improving and accelerating
research in kidney development, PKD modeling, and therapeutic discovery. The
platform is publicly available as open-source software at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为行星户车预测可行性成本地图，解决传统方法依赖手动标注和人工评估的问题

Method: 使用DINOv3图像编码器和FiLM传感器融合技术，通过IMU导出标签进行自监督学习，采用Huber损失和平滑性损失组合优化

Result: 模型表现高稳健性，在各种干扰测试中MAE/MSE变化很小（如LiDAR稀疏化后MAE从~0.0775增至0.0915），显示几何信息在成本学习中占主导地位

Conclusion: 提供了高保真模拟环境、自监督IMU标注流程和强大多模态BEV成本地图预测模型，未来需解决领域遵适性和数据多样性问题

Abstract: We present a robust multi-modal framework for predicting traversability
costmaps for planetary rovers. Our model fuses camera and LiDAR data to produce
a bird's-eye-view (BEV) terrain costmap, trained self-supervised using
IMU-derived labels. Key updates include a DINOv3-based image encoder,
FiLM-based sensor fusion, and an optimization loss combining Huber and
smoothness terms. Experimental ablations (removing image color, occluding
inputs, adding noise) show only minor changes in MAE/MSE (e.g. MAE increases
from ~0.0775 to 0.0915 when LiDAR is sparsified), indicating that geometry
dominates the learned cost and the model is highly robust. We attribute the
small performance differences to the IMU labeling primarily reflecting terrain
geometry rather than semantics and to limited data diversity. Unlike prior work
claiming large gains, we emphasize our contributions: (1) a high-fidelity,
reproducible simulation environment; (2) a self-supervised IMU-based labeling
pipeline; and (3) a strong multi-modal BEV costmap prediction model. We discuss
limitations and future work such as domain generalization and dataset
expansion.

TL;DR: CAA-Policy是一种端到端模仿学习系统，通过控制辅助注意力机制让控制信号指导视觉注意力学习，解决了传统方法中感知与控制缺乏有效协同的问题，在CARLA模拟器中表现出优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有端到端学习方法缺乏感知与控制之间的有效协同，基于transformer的自注意力机制单独使用时会产生不稳定和时序不一致的空间注意力，影响下游策略决策的可靠性。

Method: 提出CAA-Policy系统，采用控制辅助注意力机制，通过控制输出的反向传播梯度而非训练损失来自监督训练注意力模块，同时集成短时程路径点预测作为辅助任务，并引入单独训练的运动预测模块来稳定跟踪目标位置。

Result: 在CARLA模拟器中的大量实验表明，该方法在准确性、鲁棒性和可解释性方面均优于端到端学习基线和模块化BEV分割+混合A*流水线。

Conclusion: 通过控制信号指导注意力学习，关注诱导动作输出高方差的视觉特征而非仅仅最小化训练损失，能够产生更鲁棒和可泛化的策略，为端到端自动驾驶系统提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Precise parking requires an end-to-end system where perception adaptively
provides policy-relevant details-especially in critical areas where fine
control decisions are essential. End-to-end learning offers a unified framework
by directly mapping sensor inputs to control actions, but existing approaches
lack effective synergy between perception and control. We find that
transformer-based self-attention, when used alone, tends to produce unstable
and temporally inconsistent spatial attention, which undermines the reliability
of downstream policy decisions over time. Instead, we propose CAA-Policy, an
end-to-end imitation learning system that allows control signal to guide the
learning of visual attention via a novel Control-Aided Attention (CAA)
mechanism. For the first time, we train such an attention module in a
self-supervised manner, using backpropagated gradients from the control outputs
instead of from the training loss. This strategy encourages the attention to
focus on visual features that induce high variance in action outputs, rather
than merely minimizing the training loss-a shift we demonstrate leads to a more
robust and generalizable policy. To further enhance stability, CAA-Policy
integrates short-horizon waypoint prediction as an auxiliary task, and
introduces a separately trained motion prediction module to robustly track the
target spot over time. Extensive experiments in the CARLA simulator show that
\titlevariable~consistently surpasses both the end-to-end learning baseline and
the modular BEV segmentation + hybrid A* pipeline, achieving superior accuracy,
robustness, and interpretability. Code is released at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出使用LoRA技术将全景视频生成视为从透视视图的适应问题，仅需约1000个视频即可高效微调预训练视频扩散模型，在视觉质量、左右一致性和运动多样性方面超越现有方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决360度全景视频生成的挑战，传统方法需要复杂架构或大规模训练，效率低下且效果不佳

Method: 将全景视频生成视为从透视视图到全景投影的适应问题，使用Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)技术微调预训练视频扩散模型

Result: 方法能够保持正确的投影几何，在视觉质量、左右一致性和运动多样性方面超越现有最先进方法

Conclusion: LoRA技术可有效建模透视与全景投影之间的变换，仅需少量训练数据即可实现高质量全景视频生成

Abstract: Generating high-quality 360{\deg} panoramic videos remains a significant
challenge due to the fundamental differences between panoramic and traditional
perspective-view projections. While perspective videos rely on a single
viewpoint with a limited field of view, panoramic content requires rendering
the full surrounding environment, making it difficult for standard video
generation models to adapt. Existing solutions often introduce complex
architectures or large-scale training, leading to inefficiency and suboptimal
results. Motivated by the success of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) in style
transfer tasks, we propose treating panoramic video generation as an adaptation
problem from perspective views. Through theoretical analysis, we demonstrate
that LoRA can effectively model the transformation between these projections
when its rank exceeds the degrees of freedom in the task. Our approach
efficiently fine-tunes a pretrained video diffusion model using only
approximately 1,000 videos while achieving high-quality panoramic generation.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method maintains proper projection
geometry and surpasses previous state-of-the-art approaches in visual quality,
left-right consistency, and motion diversity.

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: SMILE提供了渐进的理论支持，设计了超分辨率引导下的新解混框架，成功解决了多任务学习中的关键挑战。

Abstract: The performance of hyperspectral unmixing may be constrained by low spatial
resolution, which can be enhanced using super-resolution in a multitask
learning way. However, integrating super-resolution and unmixing directly may
suffer two challenges: Task affinity is not verified, and the convergence of
unmixing is not guaranteed. To address the above issues, in this paper, we
provide theoretical analysis and propose super-resolution guided multi-task
learning method for hyperspectral unmixing (SMILE). The provided theoretical
analysis validates feasibility of multitask learning way and verifies task
affinity, which consists of relationship and existence theorems by proving the
positive guidance of super-resolution. The proposed framework generalizes
positive information from super-resolution to unmixing by learning both shared
and specific representations. Moreover, to guarantee the convergence, we
provide the accessibility theorem by proving the optimal solution of unmixing.
The major contributions of SMILE include providing progressive theoretical
support, and designing a new framework for unmixing under the guidance of
super-resolution. Our experiments on both synthetic and real datasets have
substantiate the usefulness of our work.

Conclusion: Cog-TD方法通过Copula理论成功解决了多时相高光谱解混中的时序依赖建模问题，为动态材料演化分析提供了有效工具

Abstract: Multitemporal hyperspectral unmixing (MTHU) aims to model variable endmembers
and dynamical abundances, which emphasizes the critical temporal information.
However, existing methods have limitations in modeling temporal dependency,
thus fail to capture the dynamical material evolution. Motivated by the ability
of copula theory in modeling dependency structure explicitly, in this paper, we
propose a copula-guided temporal dependency method (Cog-TD) for multitemporal
hyperspectral unmixing. Cog-TD defines new mathematical model, constructs
copula-guided framework and provides two key modules with theoretical support.
The mathematical model provides explicit formulations for MTHU problem
definition, which describes temporal dependency structure by incorporating
copula theory. The copula-guided framework is constructed for utilizing copula
function, which estimates dynamical endmembers and abundances with temporal
dependency. The key modules consist of copula function estimation and temporal
dependency guidance, which computes and employs temporal information to guide
unmixing process. Moreover, the theoretical support demonstrates that estimated
copula function is valid and the represented temporal dependency exists in
hyperspectral images. The major contributions of this paper include redefining
MTHU problem with temporal dependency, proposing a copula-guided framework,
developing two key modules and providing theoretical support. Our experimental
results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the utility of
the proposed method.

Abstract: Timely assessment of structural damage is critical for disaster response and
recovery. However, most prior work in natural disaster analysis relies on 2D
imagery, which lacks depth, suffers from occlusions, and provides limited
spatial context. 3D semantic segmentation offers a richer alternative, but
existing 3D benchmarks focus mainly on urban or indoor scenes, with little
attention to disaster-affected areas. To address this gap, we present
3DAeroRelief--the first 3D benchmark dataset specifically designed for
post-disaster assessment. Collected using low-cost unmanned aerial vehicles
(UAVs) over hurricane-damaged regions, the dataset features dense 3D point
clouds reconstructed via Structure-from-Motion and Multi-View Stereo
techniques. Semantic annotations were produced through manual 2D labeling and
projected into 3D space. Unlike existing datasets, 3DAeroRelief captures 3D
large-scale outdoor environments with fine-grained structural damage in
real-world disaster contexts. UAVs enable affordable, flexible, and safe data
collection in hazardous areas, making them particularly well-suited for
emergency scenarios. To demonstrate the utility of 3DAeroRelief, we evaluate
several state-of-the-art 3D segmentation models on the dataset to highlight
both the challenges and opportunities of 3D scene understanding in disaster
response. Our dataset serves as a valuable resource for advancing robust 3D
vision systems in real-world applications for post-disaster scenarios.

Conclusion: GEMMNet有效解决了多模态遥感数据中的模态缺失问题，通过创新的架构设计在语义分割任务中取得了优越性能，为多模态学习在复杂场景中的应用提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Multimodal learning has shown significant performance boost compared to
ordinary unimodal models across various domains. However, in real-world
scenarios, multimodal signals are susceptible to missing because of sensor
failures and adverse weather conditions, which drastically deteriorates models'
operation and performance. Generative models such as AutoEncoder (AE) and
Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) are intuitive solutions aiming to
reconstruct missing modality from available ones. Yet, their efficacy in remote
sensing semantic segmentation remains underexplored. In this paper, we first
examine the limitations of existing generative approaches in handling the
heterogeneity of multimodal remote sensing data. They inadequately capture
semantic context in complex scenes with large intra-class and small inter-class
variation. In addition, traditional generative models are susceptible to heavy
dependence on the dominant modality, introducing bias that affects model
robustness under missing modality conditions. To tackle these limitations, we
propose a novel Generative-Enhanced MultiModal learning Network (GEMMNet) with
three key components: (1) Hybrid Feature Extractor (HyFEx) to effectively learn
modality-specific representations, (2) Hybrid Fusion with Multiscale Awareness
(HyFMA) to capture modality-synergistic semantic context across scales and (3)
Complementary Loss (CoLoss) scheme to alleviate the inherent bias by
encouraging consistency across modalities and tasks. Our method, GEMMNet,
outperforms both generative baselines AE, cGAN (conditional GAN), and
state-of-the-art non-generative approaches - mmformer and shaspec - on two
challenging semantic segmentation remote sensing datasets (Vaihingen and
Potsdam). Source code is made available.

Abstract: We propose a pipeline to extract and reconstruct dynamic 3D smoke assets from
a single in-the-wild video, and further integrate interactive simulation for
smoke design and editing. Recent developments in 3D vision have significantly
improved reconstructing and rendering fluid dynamics, supporting realistic and
temporally consistent view synthesis. However, current fluid reconstructions
rely heavily on carefully controlled clean lab environments, whereas real-world
videos captured in the wild are largely underexplored. We pinpoint three key
challenges of reconstructing smoke in real-world videos and design targeted
techniques, including smoke extraction with background removal, initialization
of smoke particles and camera poses, and inferring multi-view videos. Our
method not only outperforms previous reconstruction and generation methods with
high-quality smoke reconstructions (+2.22 average PSNR on wild videos), but
also enables diverse and realistic editing of fluid dynamics by simulating our
smoke assets. We provide our models, data, and 4D smoke assets at

TL;DR: SVR-GS是一种空间变体正则化方法，通过逐像素空间掩码优化3D高斯分布数量，相比现有方法显著减少高斯分布数量同时保持图像质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于掩码的剪枝方法（如MaskGS）使用全局均值正则化，这与决定图像质量的逐像素重建损失不匹配，需要更精确的空间感知正则化方法

Method: 提出空间变体正则化器SVR-GS，从每个高斯分布沿光线的有效贡献渲染逐像素空间掩码，在低重要性高斯分布上施加稀疏性压力，探索三种空间掩码聚合策略并在CUDA中实现

Result: 在Tanks&Temples、Deep Blending和Mip-NeRF360数据集上，SVR-GS相比MaskGS减少1.79倍高斯分布数量，相比3DGS减少5.63倍，仅导致0.50 dB和0.40 dB PSNR下降

Conclusion: SVR-GS产生更小、更快、内存效率更高的模型，适用于机器人、AR/VR和移动感知等实时应用

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables fast, high-quality novel view synthesis
but typically relies on densification followed by pruning to optimize the
number of Gaussians. Existing mask-based pruning, such as MaskGS, regularizes
the global mean of the mask, which is misaligned with the local per-pixel
(per-ray) reconstruction loss that determines image quality along individual
camera rays. This paper introduces SVR-GS, a spatially variant regularizer that
renders a per-pixel spatial mask from each Gaussian's effective contribution
along the ray, thereby applying sparsity pressure where it matters: on
low-importance Gaussians. We explore three spatial-mask aggregation strategies,
implement them in CUDA, and conduct a gradient analysis to motivate our final
design. Extensive experiments on Tanks\&Temples, Deep Blending, and Mip-NeRF360
datasets demonstrate that, on average across the three datasets, the proposed
SVR-GS reduces the number of Gaussians by 1.79\(\times\) compared to MaskGS and
5.63\(\times\) compared to 3DGS, while incurring only 0.50 dB and 0.40 dB PSNR
drops, respectively. These gains translate into significantly smaller, faster,
and more memory-efficient models, making them well-suited for real-time
applications such as robotics, AR/VR, and mobile perception.

Abstract: Effective reef monitoring requires the quantification of coral growth via
accurate volumetric and surface area estimates, which is a challenging task due
to the complex morphology of corals. We propose a novel, lightweight, and
scalable learning framework that addresses this challenge by predicting the 3D
volume and surface area of coral-like objects from 2D multi-view RGB images.
Our approach utilizes a pre-trained module (VGGT) to extract dense point maps
from each view; these maps are merged into a unified point cloud and enriched
with per-view confidence scores. The resulting cloud is fed to two parallel
DGCNN decoder heads, which jointly output the volume and the surface area of
the coral, as well as their corresponding confidence estimate. To enhance
prediction stability and provide uncertainty estimates, we introduce a
composite loss function based on Gaussian negative log-likelihood in both real
and log domains. Our method achieves competitive accuracy and generalizes well
to unseen morphologies. This framework paves the way for efficient and scalable
coral geometry estimation directly from a sparse set of images, with potential
applications in coral growth analysis and reef monitoring.

Abstract: As intelligent transportation systems advance, traffic video understanding
plays an increasingly pivotal role in comprehensive scene perception and causal
analysis. Yet, existing approaches face notable challenges in accurately
modeling spatiotemporal causality and integrating domain-specific knowledge,
limiting their effectiveness in complex scenarios. To address these
limitations, we propose Traffic-MLLM, a multimodal large language model
tailored for fine-grained traffic analysis. Built on the Qwen2.5-VL backbone,
our model leverages high-quality traffic-specific multimodal datasets and uses
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for lightweight fine-tuning, significantly enhancing
its capacity to model continuous spatiotemporal features in video sequences.
Furthermore, we introduce an innovative knowledge prompting module fusing
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG),
enabling precise injection of detailed traffic regulations and domain knowledge
into the inference process. This design markedly boosts the model's logical
reasoning and knowledge adaptation capabilities. Experimental results on
TrafficQA and DriveQA benchmarks show Traffic-MLLM achieves state-of-the-art
performance, validating its superior ability to process multimodal traffic
data. It also exhibits remarkable zero-shot reasoning and cross-scenario
generalization capabilities.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Multispectral-NeRF，一种基于NeRF的改进神经网络架构，能够有效处理多光谱信息，解决现有方法在6波段光谱3D重建中的精度和几何特征问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统3D重建方法主要依赖RGB光谱信息，而现有整合扩展光谱数据的方法存在成本高、精度低和几何特征差的问题。NeRF虽然能产生高质量重建结果，但现有模型只能处理三波段数据，无法利用多波段信息。

Method: 在NeRF基础上进行三项改进：扩展隐藏层维度以容纳6波段光谱输入；重新设计残差函数以优化重建图像与参考图像之间的光谱差异计算；调整数据压缩模块以适应多光谱图像增加的位深度需求。

Result: 实验结果表明Multispectral-NeRF成功处理了多波段光谱特征，同时准确保留了原始场景的光谱特性。

Conclusion: Multispectral-NeRF有效解决了多光谱3D重建中的技术挑战，为利用扩展光谱信息进行高质量3D重建提供了可行方案。

Abstract: 3D reconstruction technology generates three-dimensional representations of
real-world objects, scenes, or environments using sensor data such as 2D
images, with extensive applications in robotics, autonomous vehicles, and
virtual reality systems. Traditional 3D reconstruction techniques based on 2D
images typically relies on RGB spectral information. With advances in sensor
technology, additional spectral bands beyond RGB have been increasingly
incorporated into 3D reconstruction workflows. Existing methods that integrate
these expanded spectral data often suffer from expensive scheme prices, low
accuracy and poor geometric features. Three - dimensional reconstruction based
on NeRF can effectively address the various issues in current multispectral 3D
reconstruction methods, producing high - precision and high - quality
reconstruction results. However, currently, NeRF and some improved models such
as NeRFacto are trained on three - band data and cannot take into account the
multi - band information. To address this problem, we propose
Multispectral-NeRF, an enhanced neural architecture derived from NeRF that can
effectively integrates multispectral information. Our technical contributions
comprise threefold modifications: Expanding hidden layer dimensionality to
accommodate 6-band spectral inputs; Redesigning residual functions to optimize
spectral discrepancy calculations between reconstructed and reference images;
Adapting data compression modules to address the increased bit-depth
requirements of multispectral imagery. Experimental results confirm that
Multispectral-NeRF successfully processes multi-band spectral features while
accurately preserving the original scenes' spectral characteristics.

TL;DR: SPHERE是一种新的相机3D语义场景补全方法，结合体素和高斯表示，通过语义引导的高斯初始化和物理感知的谐波增强，在保持语义准确性的同时实现更真实的几何细节。


<details>

Motivation: 现有体素和平面方法难以捕捉真实几何细节，而神经重建方法如NeRF和3DGS计算成本高、收敛慢，语义准确性不足。需要一种能同时处理语义和物理信息的方法。

Method: 提出SPHERE框架：1）语义引导高斯初始化(SGI)模块利用双分支3D场景表示定位焦点体素作为锚点；2）物理感知谐波增强(PHE)模块使用语义球谐函数建模物理感知上下文细节，通过焦点分布对齐促进语义-几何一致性。

Conclusion: SPHERE成功整合了体素和高斯表示的优势，在保持语义准确性的同时实现了更真实的几何细节重建，为自动驾驶场景感知提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Camera-based 3D Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) is a critical task in
autonomous driving systems, assessing voxel-level geometry and semantics for
holistic scene perception. While existing voxel-based and plane-based SSC
methods have achieved considerable progress, they struggle to capture physical
regularities for realistic geometric details. On the other hand, neural
reconstruction methods like NeRF and 3DGS demonstrate superior physical
awareness, but suffer from high computational cost and slow convergence when
handling large-scale, complex autonomous driving scenes, leading to inferior
semantic accuracy. To address these issues, we propose the Semantic-PHysical
Engaged REpresentation (SPHERE) for camera-based SSC, which integrates voxel
and Gaussian representations for joint exploitation of semantic and physical
information. First, the Semantic-guided Gaussian Initialization (SGI) module
leverages dual-branch 3D scene representations to locate focal voxels as
anchors to guide efficient Gaussian initialization. Then, the Physical-aware
Harmonics Enhancement (PHE) module incorporates semantic spherical harmonics to
model physical-aware contextual details and promote semantic-geometry
consistency through focal distribution alignment, generating SSC results with
realistic details. Extensive experiments and analyses on the popular
SemanticKITTI and SSCBench-KITTI-360 benchmarks validate the effectiveness of
SPHERE. The code is available at

Conclusion: StegOT通过最优传输理论有效解决了隐写中的模式崩溃问题，在信息平衡和图像质量方面都取得了显著改进。

Abstract: Image hiding is often referred to as steganography, which aims to hide a
secret image in a cover image of the same resolution. Many steganography models
are based on genera-tive adversarial networks (GANs) and variational
autoencoders (VAEs). However, most existing models suffer from mode collapse.
Mode collapse will lead to an information imbalance between the cover and
secret images in the stego image and further affect the subsequent extraction.
To address these challenges, this paper proposes StegOT, an autoencoder-based
steganography model incorporating optimal transport theory. We designed the
multiple channel optimal transport (MCOT) module to transform the feature
distribution, which exhibits multiple peaks, into a single peak to achieve the
trade-off of information. Experiments demonstrate that we not only achieve a
trade-off between the cover and secret images but also enhance the quality of
both the stego and recovery images. The source code will be released on
https://github.com/Rss1124/StegOT.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然AI皮痕分类模型表现出艺，但容易受到皮色偏见的影响。FST皮色调对浅皮色主体有更高的细度，存在偏见问题，需要研究FST分组细度对AI模型的影响。

Method: 训练多个AI模型进行良性与恶性皮痕分类，使用不同细度的FST特定数据（三个组FST 1/2、3/4、5/6，以及更低细度的分组），对比与基于FST平衡数据训练的通用模型。

Result: 使用三个FST组的特定数据训练的模型表现通常更好于通用模型；降低FST调细度（如从1/2和3/4合并为1/2/3/4）会对模型性能产生负面影响。

Conclusion: FST分组细度对皮痕分类模型的训练至关重要。由于FST调可能存在人为偏见，建议在公平AI研究中避免使用FST调，转向能更好反映人类皮色多样性的替代评量标准。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) models to automatically classify skin lesions
from dermatology images have shown promising performance but also
susceptibility to bias by skin tone. The most common way of representing skin
tone information is the Fitzpatrick Skin Tone (FST) scale. The FST scale has
been criticised for having greater granularity in its skin tone categories for
lighter-skinned subjects. This paper conducts an investigation of the impact
(on performance and bias) on AI classification models of granularity in the FST
scale. By training multiple AI models to classify benign vs. malignant lesions
using FST-specific data of differing granularity, we show that: (i) when
training models using FST-specific data based on three groups (FST 1/2, 3/4 and
5/6), performance is generally better for models trained on FST-specific data
compared to a general model trained on FST-balanced data; (ii) reducing the
granularity of FST scale information (from 1/2 and 3/4 to 1/2/3/4) can have a
detrimental effect on performance. Our results highlight the importance of the
granularity of FST groups when training lesion classification models. Given the
question marks over possible human biases in the choice of categories in the
FST scale, this paper provides evidence for a move away from the FST scale in
fair AI research and a transition to an alternative scale that better
represents the diversity of human skin tones.

Abstract: Accurate tree segmentation is a key step in extracting individual tree
metrics from forest laser scans, and is essential to understanding ecosystem
functions in carbon cycling and beyond. Over the past decade, tree segmentation
algorithms have advanced rapidly due to developments in AI. However existing,
public, 3D forest datasets are not large enough to build robust tree
segmentation systems. Motivated by the success of synthetic data in other
domains such as self-driving, we investigate whether similar approaches can
help with tree segmentation. In place of expensive field data collection and
annotation, we use synthetic data during pretraining, and then require only
minimal, real forest plot annotation for fine-tuning.
  We have developed a new synthetic data generation pipeline to do this for
forest vision tasks, integrating advances in game-engines with physics-based
LiDAR simulation. As a result, we have produced a comprehensive, diverse,
annotated 3D forest dataset on an unprecedented scale. Extensive experiments
with a state-of-the-art tree segmentation algorithm and a popular real dataset
show that our synthetic data can substantially reduce the need for labelled
real data. After fine-tuning on just a single, real, forest plot of less than
0.1 hectare, the pretrained model achieves segmentations that are competitive
with a model trained on the full scale real data. We have also identified
critical factors for successful use of synthetic data: physics, diversity, and
scale, paving the way for more robust 3D forest vision systems in the future.
Our data generation pipeline and the resulting dataset are available at

Abstract: In the realm of image generation, the quest for realism and customization has
never been more pressing. While existing methods like concept sliders have made
strides, they often falter when it comes to no-AIGC images, particularly images
captured in real world settings. To bridge this gap, we introduce Beyond
Sliders, an innovative framework that integrates GANs and diffusion models to
facilitate sophisticated image manipulation across diverse image categories.
Improved upon concept sliders, our method refines the image through fine
grained guidance both textual and visual in an adversarial manner, leading to a
marked enhancement in image quality and realism. Extensive experimental
validation confirms the robustness and versatility of Beyond Sliders across a
spectrum of applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 细粒度视觉分类对几何变化（方向、尺度、透视畸变）高度敏感，现有等变架构计算资源需求大且限制假设空间，需要更灵活、主干网络无关的解决方案

Method: 扩展空间变换网络(STNs)，将仿射变换分解为旋转、缩放和剪切组件，使用共享定位编码器在几何约束下回归各组件，采用高斯变分后验建模不确定性，在推理时进行基于采样的规范化，并引入组件级对齐损失

Conclusion: 概率化组件式STNs为基于transformer的视觉管道提供了灵活、主干网络无关的规范化工具，有效提升了细粒度视觉分类对几何变化的鲁棒性

Abstract: Fine-grained visual classification (FGVC) remains highly sensitive to
geometric variability, where objects appear under arbitrary orientations,
scales, and perspective distortions. While equivariant architectures address
this issue, they typically require substantial computational resources and
restrict the hypothesis space. We revisit Spatial Transformer Networks (STNs)
as a canonicalization tool for transformer-based vision pipelines, emphasizing
their flexibility, backbone-agnostic nature, and lack of architectural
constraints. We propose a probabilistic, component-wise extension that improves
robustness. Specifically, we decompose affine transformations into rotation,
scaling, and shearing, and regress each component under geometric constraints
using a shared localization encoder. To capture uncertainty, we model each
component with a Gaussian variational posterior and perform sampling-based
canonicalization during inference.A novel component-wise alignment loss
leverages augmentation parameters to guide spatial alignment. Experiments on
challenging moth classification benchmarks demonstrate that our method
consistently improves robustness compared to other STNs.

Abstract: Cattle identification is critical for efficient livestock farming management,
currently reliant on radio-frequency identification (RFID) ear tags. However,
RFID-based systems are prone to failure due to loss, damage, tampering, and
vulnerability to external attacks. As a robust alternative, biometric
identification using cattle muzzle patterns similar to human fingerprints has
emerged as a promising solution. Deep learning techniques have demonstrated
success in leveraging these unique patterns for accurate identification. But
deep learning models face significant challenges, including limited data
availability, disruptions during data collection, and dynamic herd compositions
that require frequent model retraining. To address these limitations, this
paper proposes a novel few-shot learning framework for real-time cattle
identification using Cooperative Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (CCoMAML) with
Multi-Head Attention Feature Fusion (MHAFF) as a feature extractor model. This
model offers great model adaptability to new data through efficient learning
from few data samples without retraining. The proposed approach has been
rigorously evaluated against current state-of-the-art few-shot learning
techniques applied in cattle identification. Comprehensive experimental results
demonstrate that our proposed CCoMAML with MHAFF has superior cattle
identification performance with 98.46% and 97.91% F1 scores.

Conclusion: ANROT-HELANet通过Hellinger距离聚合、注意力机制和新颖损失函数的组合，在保持对抗性和自然鲁棒性的同时，建立了小样本学习的新最先进性能。

Abstract: Few-Shot Learning (FSL), which involves learning to generalize using only a
few data samples, has demonstrated promising and superior performances to
ordinary CNN methods. While Bayesian based estimation approaches using
Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence have shown improvements, they remain
vulnerable to adversarial attacks and natural noises. We introduce
ANROT-HELANet, an Adversarially and Naturally RObusT Hellinger Aggregation
Network that significantly advances the state-of-the-art in FSL robustness and
performance. Our approach implements an adversarially and naturally robust
Hellinger distance-based feature class aggregation scheme, demonstrating
resilience to adversarial perturbations up to $\epsilon=0.30$ and Gaussian
noise up to $\sigma=0.30$. The network achieves substantial improvements across
benchmark datasets, including gains of 1.20\% and 1.40\% for 1-shot and 5-shot
scenarios on miniImageNet respectively. We introduce a novel Hellinger
Similarity contrastive loss function that generalizes cosine similarity
contrastive loss for variational few-shot inference scenarios. Our approach
also achieves superior image reconstruction quality with a FID score of 2.75,
outperforming traditional VAE (3.43) and WAE (3.38) approaches. Extensive
experiments conducted on four few-shot benchmarked datasets verify that
ANROT-HELANet's combination of Hellinger distance-based feature aggregation,
attention mechanisms, and our novel loss function establishes new
state-of-the-art performance while maintaining robustness against both
adversarial and natural perturbations. Our code repository will be available at

Abstract: This paper presents MIS-LSTM, a hybrid framework that joins CNN encoders with
an LSTM sequence model for sleep quality and stress prediction at the day level
from multimodal lifelog data. Continuous sensor streams are first partitioned
into N-hour blocks and rendered as multi-channel images, while sparse discrete
events are encoded with a dedicated 1D-CNN. A Convolutional Block Attention
Module fuses the two modalities into refined block embeddings, which an LSTM
then aggregates to capture long-range temporal dependencies. To further boost
robustness, we introduce UALRE, an uncertainty-aware ensemble that overrides
lowconfidence majority votes with high-confidence individual predictions.
Experiments on the 2025 ETRI Lifelog Challenge dataset show that Our base
MISLSTM achieves Macro-F1 0.615; with the UALRE ensemble, the score improves to
0.647, outperforming strong LSTM, 1D-CNN, and CNN baselines. Ablations confirm
(i) the superiority of multi-channel over stacked-vertical imaging, (ii) the
benefit of a 4-hour block granularity, and (iii) the efficacy of

Abstract: Person Re-Identification (ReID) has several challenges in real-world
surveillance systems due to clothing changes (CCReID) and the need for
maintaining continual learning (LReID). Previous existing methods either
develop models specifically for one application, which is mostly a same-cloth
(SC) setting or treat CCReID as its own separate sub-problem. In this work, we
will introduce the LReID-Hybrid task with the goal of developing a model to
achieve both SC and CC while learning in a continual setting. Mismatched
representations and forgetting from one task to the next are significant
issues, we address this with CMLReID, a CLIP-based framework composed of two
novel tasks: (1) Context-Aware Semantic Prompt (CASP) that generates adaptive
prompts, and also incorporates context to align richly multi-grained visual
cues with semantic text space; and (2) Adaptive Knowledge Fusion and Projection
(AKFP) which produces robust SC/CC prototypes through the use of a dual-path
learner that aligns features with our Clothing-State-Aware Projection Loss.
Experiments performed on a wide range of datasets and illustrate that CMLReID
outperforms all state-of-the-art methods with strong robustness and
generalization despite clothing variations and a sophisticated process of

Abstract: Class-Incremental Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (CI-UDA) aims to adapt a
model from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain, where the
sets of potential target classes appearing at different time steps are disjoint
and are subsets of the source classes. The key to solving this problem lies in
avoiding catastrophic forgetting of knowledge about previous target classes
during continuously mitigating the domain shift. Most previous works
cumbersomely combine two technical components. On one hand, they need to store
and utilize rehearsal target sample from previous time steps to avoid
catastrophic forgetting; on the other hand, they perform alignment only between
classes shared across domains at each time step. Consequently, the memory will
continuously increase and the asymmetric alignment may inevitably result in
knowledge forgetting. In this paper, we propose to mine and preserve
domain-invariant and class-agnostic knowledge to facilitate the CI-UDA task.
Specifically, via using CLIP, we extract the class-agnostic properties which we
name as "attribute". In our framework, we learn a "key-value" pair to represent
an attribute, where the key corresponds to the visual prototype and the value
is the textual prompt. We maintain two attribute dictionaries, each
corresponding to a different domain. Then we perform attribute alignment across
domains to mitigate the domain shift, via encouraging visual attention
consistency and prediction consistency. Through attribute modeling and
cross-domain alignment, we effectively reduce catastrophic knowledge forgetting
while mitigating the domain shift, in a rehearsal-free way. Experiments on
three CI-UDA benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms previous
state-of-the-art methods and effectively alleviates catastrophic forgetting.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的综合性评估框架，通过广义交叉验证和领域迁移学习原理，实现对合成数据集质量的可比较性评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着合成数据集生成技术的快速发展，评估合成数据质量成为关键研究重点。目前缺乏普遍接受的标准化评估框架，影响了合成数据的优化利用。

Method: 构建了一个综合性评估框架，包括训练任务特定模型（如YOLOv5s）在合成数据集和多个真实数据集（如KITTI、BDD100K）上，形成交叉性能矩阵，通过归一化处理构建GCV矩阵来量化领域迁移能力。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of synthetic dataset generation techniques,
evaluating the quality of synthetic data has become a critical research focus.
Robust evaluation not only drives innovations in data generation methods but
also guides researchers in optimizing the utilization of these synthetic
resources. However, current evaluation studies for synthetic datasets remain
limited, lacking a universally accepted standard framework. To address this,
this paper proposes a novel evaluation framework integrating generalized
cross-validation experiments and domain transfer learning principles, enabling
generalizable and comparable assessments of synthetic dataset quality. The
framework involves training task-specific models (e.g., YOLOv5s) on both
synthetic datasets and multiple real-world benchmarks (e.g., KITTI, BDD100K),
forming a cross-performance matrix. Following normalization, a Generalized
Cross-Validation (GCV) Matrix is constructed to quantify domain
transferability. The framework introduces two key metrics. One measures the
simulation quality by quantifying the similarity between synthetic data and
real-world datasets, while another evaluates the transfer quality by assessing
the diversity and coverage of synthetic data across various real-world
scenarios. Experimental validation on Virtual KITTI demonstrates the
effectiveness of our proposed framework and metrics in assessing synthetic data
fidelity. This scalable and quantifiable evaluation solution overcomes
traditional limitations, providing a principled approach to guide synthetic
dataset optimization in artificial intelligence research.

TL;DR: ROSGS是一个两阶段的高效室外场景重光照重建方法，使用Gaussian Splatting表示，通过混合光照模型实现准确的重光照效果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 室外图像数据通常包含无界场景和变化的照明条件，现有方法存在计算开销大和低频光照表示导致渲染效率低和重光照精度差的问题

Method: 两阶段流程：1) 利用单目法线先验和2DGS重建几何；2) 使用混合光照模型分解纹理和光照，包括球形高斯函数捕捉高频阳光和球谐系数建模低频天光

Result: 定量指标和定性比较表明，ROSGS在室外场景重光照方面达到最先进性能，具有优越的重光照精度和渲染效率

Conclusion: ROSGS方法通过创新的两阶段设计和混合光照模型，成功解决了室外场景重光照的挑战，在精度和效率方面都表现出色

Abstract: Image data captured outdoors often exhibit unbounded scenes and
unconstrained, varying lighting conditions, making it challenging to decompose
them into geometry, reflectance, and illumination. Recent works have focused on
achieving this decomposition using Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) or the 3D
Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representation but remain hindered by two key
limitations: the high computational overhead associated with neural networks of
NeRF and the use of low-frequency lighting representations, which often result
in inefficient rendering and suboptimal relighting accuracy. We propose ROSGS,
a two-stage pipeline designed to efficiently reconstruct relightable outdoor
scenes using the Gaussian Splatting representation. By leveraging monocular
normal priors, ROSGS first reconstructs the scene's geometry with the compact
2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) representation, providing an efficient and
accurate geometric foundation. Building upon this reconstructed geometry, ROSGS
then decomposes the scene's texture and lighting through a hybrid lighting
model. This model effectively represents typical outdoor lighting by employing
a spherical Gaussian function to capture the directional, high-frequency
components of sunlight, while learning a radiance transfer function via
Spherical Harmonic coefficients to model the remaining low-frequency skylight
comprehensively. Both quantitative metrics and qualitative comparisons
demonstrate that ROSGS achieves state-of-the-art performance in relighting
outdoor scenes and highlight its ability to deliver superior relighting
accuracy and rendering efficiency.

Motivation: 解决现有LiDAR 3D单目标跟踪方法的两难问题：双帧方法高效但缺乏长期时序上下文，序列方法鲁棒但计算成本高

Method: 基于轨迹的新范式，通过历史边界框轨迹隐式学习运动连续性，包含快速显式运动提议和隐式运动建模模块

Result: 在NuScenes基准测试中达到新的SOTA性能，跟踪精度提升4.48%，运行速度56 FPS，且在不同基跟踪器上表现出强泛化性

Conclusion: TrajTrack框架成功解决了效率与鲁棒性的权衡问题，为3D单目标跟踪提供了轻量级且高性能的解决方案

Abstract: LiDAR-based 3D single object tracking (3D SOT) is a critical task in robotics
and autonomous systems. Existing methods typically follow frame-wise motion
estimation or a sequence-based paradigm. However, the two-frame methods are
efficient but lack long-term temporal context, making them vulnerable in sparse
or occluded scenes, while sequence-based methods that process multiple point
clouds gain robustness at a significant computational cost. To resolve this
dilemma, we propose a novel trajectory-based paradigm and its instantiation,
TrajTrack. TrajTrack is a lightweight framework that enhances a base two-frame
tracker by implicitly learning motion continuity from historical bounding box
trajectories alone-without requiring additional, costly point cloud inputs. It
first generates a fast, explicit motion proposal and then uses an implicit
motion modeling module to predict the future trajectory, which in turn refines
and corrects the initial proposal. Extensive experiments on the large-scale
NuScenes benchmark show that TrajTrack achieves new state-of-the-art
performance, dramatically improving tracking precision by 4.48% over a strong
baseline while running at 56 FPS. Besides, we also demonstrate the strong
generalizability of TrajTrack across different base trackers. Video is

Motivation: 现有幻觉缓解方法主要基于偏好对齐，需要外部人工标注或辅助模型收集偏好数据，增加了成本并限制了持续改进

Method: APASI利用目标LVLM自注入幻觉到生成响应中，创建具有不同偏好级别的响应对，结合迭代对齐训练策略和课程学习

Result: 在六个基准测试上的广泛实验表明，APASI不仅有效缓解了三个基线模型的幻觉，而且达到了与依赖外部方法相当甚至更优的性能

Conclusion: APASI展示了无需外部依赖的有效幻觉缓解能力，具有良好的泛化性能，为LVLM的持续改进提供了可行方案

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) suffer from serious hallucination
problems, where the model-generated responses are inconsistent with the visual
inputs. Existing hallucination mitigation methods are mainly based on
preference alignment and require external human annotations or auxiliary models
for preference data collection, which increase costs and limit sustainable
improvement. To tackle these challenges, we propose Autonomous Preference
Alignment via Self-Injection (APASI), a novel and generalizable method that
mitigates hallucinations without external dependencies. APASI leverages the
target LVLM to self-inject hallucinations into a generated response, creating a
pair of responses with varying preference levels. During the self-injection
process, the dis-preferred response is generated based on three key
observations of hallucinations, ensuring it simulates real hallucination
patterns. This fidelity offers an accurate learning signal for hallucination
mitigation. Moreover, APASI incorporates an iterative alignment training
strategy combined with curriculum learning to periodically update the
preference data with increasing challenge, enabling stable and continuous
enhancement of the LVLM. Extensive experiments across six benchmarks show that
APASI not only effectively mitigates hallucinations for three baseline models
but also achieves comparable or even superior performance to alignment-based
methods with external dependency, thereby demonstrating its effectiveness and
generalization capability. The code is available at

Motivation: 尽管生成式世界模型在视频和占据数据合成方面取得了进展，但LiDAR生成仍然未被充分探索，而4D LiDAR数据生成面临着可控性、时间稳定性和评估方面的挑战。

Method: 使用语言指令解析为以自我为中心的场景图，通过三分支扩散模型生成对象布局、轨迹和形状，范围图像扩散模型生成初始扫描，自回归模块扩展为时间相干序列，支持对象级编辑操作。

Conclusion: LiDARCrafter为基于LiDAR的仿真和数据增强提供了基础框架，成功解决了4D LiDAR数据生成的挑战。

Abstract: While generative world models have advanced video and occupancy-based data
synthesis, LiDAR generation remains underexplored despite its importance for
accurate 3D perception. Extending generation to 4D LiDAR data introduces
challenges in controllability, temporal stability, and evaluation. We present
LiDARCrafter, a unified framework that converts free-form language into
editable LiDAR sequences. Instructions are parsed into ego-centric scene
graphs, which a tri-branch diffusion model transforms into object layouts,
trajectories, and shapes. A range-image diffusion model generates the initial
scan, and an autoregressive module extends it into a temporally coherent
sequence. The explicit layout design further supports object-level editing,
such as insertion or relocation. To enable fair assessment, we provide
EvalSuite, a benchmark spanning scene-, object-, and sequence-level metrics. On
nuScenes, LiDARCrafter achieves state-of-the-art fidelity, controllability, and
temporal consistency, offering a foundation for LiDAR-based simulation and data
augmentation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前未对齐场景变化检测方法仅依赖2D视觉线索建立跨图像对应关系，在大视角变化时容易失效，且缺乏显式几何推理能力，限制了多视角知识的泛化学习

Method: 利用几何基础模型提取几何先验知识，结合视觉基础模型的强大表示能力，构建免训练框架来处理视角未对齐情况下的可靠变化检测

Result: 在PSCD、ChangeSim和PASLCD数据集上的广泛评估表明，该方法实现了优越且鲁棒的性能

Conclusion: 几何先验知识的引入显著提升了未对齐场景变化检测的可靠性，为处理视角变化和遮挡问题提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Unaligned Scene Change Detection aims to detect scene changes between image
pairs captured at different times without assuming viewpoint alignment. To
handle viewpoint variations, current methods rely solely on 2D visual cues to
establish cross-image correspondence to assist change detection. However, large
viewpoint changes can alter visual observations, causing appearance-based
matching to drift or fail. Additionally, supervision limited to 2D change masks
from small-scale SCD datasets restricts the learning of generalizable
multi-view knowledge, making it difficult to reliably identify visual overlaps
and handle occlusions. This lack of explicit geometric reasoning represents a
critical yet overlooked limitation. In this work, we are the first to leverage
geometric priors from a Geometric Foundation Model to address the core
challenges of unaligned SCD, including reliable identification of visual
overlaps, robust correspondence establishment, and explicit occlusion
detection. Building on these priors, we propose a training-free framework that
integrates them with the powerful representations of a visual foundation model
to enable reliable change detection under viewpoint misalignment. Through
extensive evaluation on the PSCD, ChangeSim, and PASLCD datasets, we
demonstrate that our approach achieves superior and robust performance. Our
code will be released at https://github.com/ZilingLiu/GeoSCD.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法缺乏深度预测的不确定性建模，且需要为每个环境训练定制深度网络，限制了泛化能力和实际应用。

Method: 提出概率模型将深度预测建模为显式概率分布，利用现成的预训练单目深度模型，无需环境特定的网络训练。

Result: 在大规模合成和真实数据集上验证，在LaMAR HGE数据集上长序列定位召回率提高2.7倍，短序列提高16.7倍。

Conclusion: UnLoc通过不确定性建模和预训练模型的使用，显著提高了室内定位的准确性、鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: We propose UnLoc, an efficient data-driven solution for sequential camera
localization within floorplans. Floorplan data is readily available, long-term
persistent, and robust to changes in visual appearance. We address key
limitations of recent methods, such as the lack of uncertainty modeling in
depth predictions and the necessity for custom depth networks trained for each
environment. We introduce a novel probabilistic model that incorporates
uncertainty estimation, modeling depth predictions as explicit probability
distributions. By leveraging off-the-shelf pre-trained monocular depth models,
we eliminate the need to rely on per-environment-trained depth networks,
enhancing generalization to unseen spaces. We evaluate UnLoc on large-scale
synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating significant improvements over
existing methods in terms of accuracy and robustness. Notably, we achieve $2.7$
times higher localization recall on long sequences (100 frames) and $16.7$
times higher on short ones (15 frames) than the state of the art on the
challenging LaMAR HGE dataset.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为SIKNet的语义独立卡尔曼网络，用于多目标跟踪中的运动估计，通过语义独立编码器处理状态向量，在非平稳运动场景下优于传统卡尔曼滤波和其他学习辅助滤波器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于线性恒定速度模型的卡尔曼滤波在参数不匹配和物体非平稳运动时表现不佳，需要更鲁棒的运动估计方法来减少跟踪失败和身份切换。

Method: 使用语义独立编码器(SIE)分两步编码状态向量：首先用1x1卷积处理同质语义元素，然后用全连接层和非线性激活层处理异质语义元素间的非线性依赖关系。

Result: 在大规模半仿真数据集上的实验表明，SIKNet优于传统卡尔曼滤波，在鲁棒性和准确性方面都超过了现有的学习辅助滤波器。

Conclusion: SIKNet为多目标跟踪中的运动估计提供了更有效的解决方案，特别是在处理非平稳运动时表现出色，代码已开源。

Abstract: Motion estimation is a crucial component in multi-object tracking (MOT).
  It predicts the trajectory of objects by analyzing the changes in their
positions in consecutive frames of images, reducing tracking failures and
identity switches.
  The Kalman filter (KF) based on the linear constant-velocity model is one of
the most commonly used methods in MOT.
  However, it may yield unsatisfactory results when KF's parameters are
mismatched and objects move in non-stationary.
  In this work, we utilize the learning-aided filter to handle the motion
estimation of MOT.
  In particular, we propose a novel method named Semantic-Independent KalmanNet
(SIKNet), which encodes the state vector (the input feature) using a
Semantic-Independent Encoder (SIE) by two steps.
  First, the SIE uses a 1D convolution with a kernel size of 1, which convolves
along the dimension of homogeneous-semantic elements across different state
vectors to encode independent semantic information.
  Then it employs a fully-connected layer and a nonlinear activation layer to
encode nonlinear and cross-dependency information between
heterogeneous-semantic elements.
  To independently evaluate the performance of the motion estimation module in
MOT, we constructed a large-scale semi-simulated dataset from several
open-source MOT datasets.
  Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed SIKNet outperforms the
traditional KF and achieves superior robustness and accuracy than existing
learning-aided filters.

TL;DR: 该博士研究探讨了在医学图像计算中如何有效建模长距离视觉依赖关系，比较了Transformer、CNN和MLP方法的优劣，发现MLP在建模高分辨率医学图像的细粒度长距离依赖方面优于Transformer和CNN。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分析需要同时捕捉全局长距离上下文和局部细微视觉特征，但现有方法如CNN受限于局部性，Transformer因计算负载高无法处理高分辨率特征，MLP方法在医学图像领域尚未得到充分研究。

Method: 研究首先创新性地使用Transformer处理像素级和图像级医学视觉任务，然后重点开发基于MLP的视觉模型来捕捉医学图像中的细粒度长距离视觉依赖关系。

Result: 大量实验证实了长距离依赖建模在医学图像计算中的关键作用，并发现MLP能够在包含丰富解剖/病理细节的高分辨率医学特征中建模更细粒度的长距离依赖。

Conclusion: MLP被确立为优于Transformer/CNN的范式，能够持续提升各种医学视觉任务的性能，为下一代医学视觉骨干网络铺平了道路。

Abstract: Medical Image Computing (MIC) is a broad research topic covering both
pixel-wise (e.g., segmentation, registration) and image-wise (e.g.,
classification, regression) vision tasks. Effective analysis demands models
that capture both global long-range context and local subtle visual
characteristics, necessitating fine-grained long-range visual dependency
modeling. Compared to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) that are limited by
intrinsic locality, transformers excel at long-range modeling; however, due to
the high computational loads of self-attention, transformers typically cannot
process high-resolution features (e.g., full-scale image features before
downsampling or patch embedding) and thus face difficulties in modeling
fine-grained dependency among subtle medical image details. Concurrently,
Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP)-based visual models are recognized as
computation/memory-efficient alternatives in modeling long-range visual
dependency but have yet to be widely investigated in the MIC community. This
doctoral research advances deep learning-based MIC by investigating effective
long-range visual dependency modeling. It first presents innovative use of
transformers for both pixel- and image-wise medical vision tasks. The focus
then shifts to MLPs, pioneeringly developing MLP-based visual models to capture
fine-grained long-range visual dependency in medical images. Extensive
experiments confirm the critical role of long-range dependency modeling in MIC
and reveal a key finding: MLPs provide feasibility in modeling finer-grained
long-range dependency among higher-resolution medical features containing
enriched anatomical/pathological details. This finding establishes MLPs as a
superior paradigm over transformers/CNNs, consistently enhancing performance
across various medical vision tasks and paving the way for next-generation
medical vision backbones.

Motivation: 在近环境温度条件下，反射和发射光成分通常大小相当且随时间变化，传统方法假设单一成分主导或恒定不再适用，需要新的分离方法

Method: 推导双波段热成像图像形成模型，开发算法估计表面发射率和时变温度，同时隔离动态背景

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效分离热成像中的反射和发射成分，为理解物体属性（发射率、温度、反射率和形状）提供了重要工具

Abstract: Long-wave infrared radiation captured by a thermal camera consists of two
components: (a) light from the environment reflected or transmitted by a
surface, and (b) light emitted by the surface after undergoing heat transport
through the object and exchanging heat with the surrounding environment.
Separating these components is essential for understanding object properties
such as emissivity, temperature, reflectance and shape. Previous thermography
studies often assume that only one component is dominant (e.g., in welding) or
that the second component is constant and can be subtracted. However, in
near-ambient conditions, which are most relevant to computer vision
applications, both components are typically comparable in magnitude and vary
over time. We introduce the first method that separates reflected and emitted
components of light in videos captured by two thermal cameras with different
spectral sensitivities. We derive a dual-band thermal image formation model and
develop algorithms to estimate the surface's emissivity and its time-varying
temperature while isolating a dynamic background. We quantitatively evaluate
our approach using carefully calibrated emissivities for a range of materials
and show qualitative results on complex everyday scenes, such as a glass filled
with hot liquid and people moving in the background.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究自监督学习在实例一致性不保证的情况下的有效性，发现即使正对缺乏严格实例一致性，SSL仍能学习有意义的表征，适度的视图多样性可提升性能，但过度多样性会降低效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自监督学习依赖实例一致性假设，即同一图像的不同视图可视为正对，但这一假设在非标志性数据中不成立，因为不同视图可能包含不同对象或语义信息。

Method: 通过广泛的消融研究，分析SSL在实例一致性不保证时的表现，采用Earth Mover's Distance (EMD)作为估计器来测量视图间的互信息，验证不同设置下的发现。

Result: SSL即使在没有严格实例一致性的情况下仍能学习有意义的表征；增加视图多样性（零重叠或较小裁剪尺度）可提升分类和密集预测任务的下游性能；适度的EMD值与改进的SSL学习相关。

Conclusion: 视图多样性存在最佳范围，适度的多样性可增强SSL性能，EMD可作为有用的估计器来指导未来SSL框架设计，研究结果在多样化数据源上具有鲁棒性和适用性。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) conventionally relies on the instance
consistency paradigm, assuming that different views of the same image can be
treated as positive pairs. However, this assumption breaks down for non-iconic
data, where different views may contain distinct objects or semantic
information. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of SSL when
instance consistency is not guaranteed. Through extensive ablation studies, we
demonstrate that SSL can still learn meaningful representations even when
positive pairs lack strict instance consistency. Furthermore, our analysis
further reveals that increasing view diversity, by enforcing zero overlapping
or using smaller crop scales, can enhance downstream performance on
classification and dense prediction tasks. However, excessive diversity is
found to reduce effectiveness, suggesting an optimal range for view diversity.
To quantify this, we adopt the Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) as an estimator to
measure mutual information between views, finding that moderate EMD values
correlate with improved SSL learning, providing insights for future SSL
framework design. We validate our findings across a range of settings,
highlighting their robustness and applicability on diverse data sources.

TL;DR: 论文提出两种正则化策略来提高CNN对图像损坏的鲁棒性：通过辅助损失强制原始与低频滤波输入的特征一致性，以及使用监督对比学习构建基于形状的特征表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CNN在图像分类中表现出色但对常见损坏脆弱，主要原因是过度依赖局部纹理而非全局形状信息，这与人类感知方式形成鲜明对比。

Method: 1）引入辅助损失，强制原始图像和低频滤波图像的特征一致性，减少对高频纹理的依赖；2）采用监督对比学习，构建以类别一致性和形状相关性为中心的特征空间结构。

Result: 在CIFAR-10-C基准测试中，两种方法都提高了对图像损坏的鲁棒性，同时保持了原始准确率。

Conclusion: 损失级别的正则化可以有效引导CNN学习更具形状感知能力和鲁棒性的表示。

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) excel at image classification but remain
vulnerable to common corruptions that humans handle with ease. A key reason for
this fragility is their reliance on local texture cues rather than global
object shapes -- a stark contrast to human perception. To address this, we
propose two complementary regularization strategies designed to encourage
shape-biased representations and enhance robustness. The first introduces an
auxiliary loss that enforces feature consistency between original and
low-frequency filtered inputs, discouraging dependence on high-frequency
textures. The second incorporates supervised contrastive learning to structure
the feature space around class-consistent, shape-relevant representations.
Evaluated on the CIFAR-10-C benchmark, both methods improve corruption
robustness without degrading clean accuracy. Our results suggest that
loss-level regularization can effectively steer CNNs toward more shape-aware,
resilient representations.

Abstract: Video detailed captioning aims to generate comprehensive video descriptions
to facilitate video understanding. Recently, most efforts in the video detailed
captioning community have been made towards a local-to-global paradigm, which
first generates local captions from video clips and then summarizes them into a
global caption. However, we find this paradigm leads to less detailed and
contextual-inconsistent captions, which can be attributed to (1) no mechanism
to ensure fine-grained captions, and (2) weak interaction between local and
global captions. To remedy the above two issues, we propose GLaVE-Cap, a
Global-Local aligned framework with Vision Expert integration for Captioning,
which consists of two core modules: TrackFusion enables comprehensive local
caption generation, by leveraging vision experts to acquire cross-frame visual
prompts, coupled with a dual-stream structure; while CaptionBridge establishes
a local-global interaction, by using global context to guide local captioning,
and adaptively summarizing local captions into a coherent global caption.
Besides, we construct GLaVE-Bench, a comprehensive video captioning benchmark
featuring 5X more queries per video than existing benchmarks, covering diverse
visual dimensions to facilitate reliable evaluation. We further provide a
training dataset GLaVE-1.2M containing 16K high-quality fine-grained video
captions and 1.2M related question-answer pairs. Extensive experiments on four
benchmarks show that our GLaVE-Cap achieves state-of-the-art performance.
Besides, the ablation studies and student model analyses further validate the
effectiveness of the proposed modules and the contribution of GLaVE-1.2M to the
video understanding community. The source code, model weights, benchmark, and
dataset will be open-sourced.

Abstract: Three-dimensional (3-D) skin surface reconstruction offers promise for
objective and quantitative dermatological assessment, but no portable,
high-resolution device exists that has been validated and used for depth
reconstruction across various body locations. We present a compact 3-D skin
reconstruction probe based on GelSight tactile imaging with a custom elastic

sensing for consistent contact, achieves a mean absolute error of 12.55 micron
on wrinkle-like test objects. In a study with 15 participants without skin
disorders, we provide the first validated wrinkle depth metrics across multiple
body regions. We further demonstrate statistically significant reductions in
wrinkle height at three locations following over-the-counter moisturizer
application. Our work offers a validated tool for clinical and cosmetic skin
analysis, with potential applications in diagnosis, treatment monitoring, and

Motivation: 现有的状态空间模型（如Mamba）虽然通过输入依赖的选择性在三个关键参数上表现出潜力，但控制时间记忆的关键遗忘门（A矩阵）仍然是静态的，这限制了模型的表达能力。

Method: 引入混合专家方法，基于输入特征动态选择上下文相关的A矩阵，增强表示能力而不牺牲计算效率。

Abstract: We present MixANT, a novel architecture for stochastic long-term dense
anticipation of human activities. While recent State Space Models (SSMs) like
Mamba have shown promise through input-dependent selectivity on three key
parameters, the critical forget-gate ($\textbf{A}$ matrix) controlling temporal
memory remains static. We address this limitation by introducing a mixture of
experts approach that dynamically selects contextually relevant $\textbf{A}$
matrices based on input features, enhancing representational capacity without
sacrificing computational efficiency. Extensive experiments on the 50Salads,
Breakfast, and Assembly101 datasets demonstrate that MixANT consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art methods across all evaluation settings. Our

reliable prediction of human behavior in diverse real-world scenarios.

Motivation: 真实临床环境中多模态医学影像数据常存在部分缺失，传统方法要么丢弃缺失样本，要么需要插补或重用dropout方案，限制了模型的鲁棒性和泛化能力

Method: 使用超网络动态生成针对可用模态集合的任务特定分类模型，超网络学习预测适应可用模态的任务模型参数，支持在完整和不完整样本上进行训练和推理

Result: 在人工构建的不完整数据集上验证，相比仅使用完整数据训练、先进通道dropout方法和基于插补的方法，本方法表现出优越的适应性，在25%完整度训练集上准确率绝对提升达8%

Conclusion: 通过使单一模型能够泛化到所有模态配置，该方法为真实世界多模态医学数据分析提供了高效解决方案

Abstract: In real world clinical environments, training and applying deep learning
models on multi-modal medical imaging data often struggles with partially
incomplete data. Standard approaches either discard missing samples, require
imputation or repurpose dropout learning schemes, limiting robustness and
generalizability. To address this, we propose a hypernetwork-based method that
dynamically generates task-specific classification models conditioned on the
set of available modalities. Instead of training a fixed model, a hypernetwork
learns to predict the parameters of a task model adapted to available
modalities, enabling training and inference on all samples, regardless of
completeness. We compare this approach with (1) models trained only on complete
data, (2) state of the art channel dropout methods, and (3) an imputation-based
method, using artificially incomplete datasets to systematically analyze
robustness to missing modalities. Results demonstrate superior adaptability of
our method, outperforming state of the art approaches with an absolute increase
in accuracy of up to 8% when trained on a dataset with 25% completeness (75% of
training data with missing modalities). By enabling a single model to
generalize across all modality configurations, our approach provides an
efficient solution for real-world multi-modal medical data analysis.

Result: 实现了更简单的基于顶点的高斯表示，能够高效动画化并集成到任何引擎中

Conclusion: 该方法只需修改线性混合蒙皮技术，使用任何高斯光栅化器即可实现有效的人脸动画重建

Abstract: Radiance field-based methods have recently been used to reconstruct human
avatars, showing that we can significantly downscale the systems needed for
creating animated human avatars. Although this progress has been initiated by
neural radiance fields, their slow rendering and backward mapping from the
observation space to the canonical space have been the main challenges. With
Gaussian splatting overcoming both challenges, a new family of approaches has
emerged that are faster to train and render, while also straightforward to
implement using forward skinning from the canonical to the observation space.
However, the linear blend skinning required for the deformation of the
Gaussians does not provide valid results for their non-linear rotation
properties. To address such artifacts, recent works use mesh properties to
rotate the non-linear Gaussian properties or train models to predict corrective
offsets. Instead, we propose a weighted rotation blending approach that
leverages quaternion averaging. This leads to simpler vertex-based Gaussians
that can be efficiently animated and integrated in any engine by only modifying
the linear blend skinning technique, and using any Gaussian rasterizer.

Motivation: 医学影像数据中存在由不同厂商、扫描参数等导致的域偏移问题，这阻碍了生物学有意义特征的学习和发现。需要一种方法来解耦生物学和技术因素，以支持跨中心的生物标志物发现。

Method: 通过后验旋转数据潜在空间来主动学习域偏移，实现生物学因素和技术因素的解耦，学习解耦表示以获得稳定的跨域组织类型聚类。

Result: 在真实临床数据上，解耦表示相比纠缠表示将聚类一致性提高了19.01%(ARI)、16.85%(NMI)和12.39%(Dice)，优于四种最先进的协调方法。在特发性肺纤维化患者组织组成量化中，学习到的特征谱增强了Cox生存预测。

Conclusion: 该无标签框架有助于在多中心常规影像数据中发现生物标志物，代码已在GitHub开源。

Abstract: Identifying new disease-related patterns in medical imaging data with the
help of machine learning enlarges the vocabulary of recognizable findings. This
supports diagnostic and prognostic assessment. However, image appearance varies
not only due to biological differences, but also due to imaging technology
linked to vendors, scanning- or re- construction parameters. The resulting
domain shifts impedes data representation learning strategies and the discovery
of biologically meaningful cluster appearances. To address these challenges, we
introduce an approach to actively learn the domain shift via post-hoc rotation
of the data latent space, enabling disentanglement of biological and technical
factors. Results on real-world heterogeneous clinical data showcase that the
learned disentangled representation leads to stable clusters representing
tissue-types across different acquisition settings. Cluster consistency is
improved by +19.01% (ARI), +16.85% (NMI), and +12.39% (Dice) compared to the
entangled representation, outperforming four state-of-the-art harmonization
methods. When using the clusters to quantify tissue composition on idiopathic
pulmonary fibrosis patients, the learned profiles enhance Cox survival
prediction. This indicates that the proposed label-free framework facilitates
biomarker discovery in multi-center routine imaging data. Code is available on

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学形态数据中缺失序列是常见问题，但深度学习模型通常需要完整的输入数据，因此需要一种能够处理缺失输入的方法。

Method: 将每个MRI序列作为单独模态，使用迟融合风格的transformer编码器整合多序列信息，并为每个模态设计单独的解码器流进行多任务重建。

Result: 在下游分割和分类任务中，方法在缺失输入序列情况下比MAE-ViT基线提升了10.1的总体Dice分数和0.46的MCC。

Conclusion: 该预训练策略能够学习到丰富的每个模态表征，同时具备处理缺失输入的能力，产生了灵活且可通用的脑部MRI编码器。

Abstract: Missing input sequences are common in medical imaging data, posing a
challenge for deep learning models reliant on complete input data. In this
work, inspired by MultiMAE [2], we develop a masked autoencoder (MAE) paradigm
for multi-modal, multi-task learning in 3D medical imaging with brain MRIs. Our
method treats each MRI sequence as a separate input modality, leveraging a
late-fusion-style transformer encoder to integrate multi-sequence information
(multi-modal) and individual decoder streams for each modality for multi-task
reconstruction. This pretraining strategy guides the model to learn rich
representations per modality while also equipping it to handle missing inputs
through cross-sequence reasoning. The result is a flexible and generalizable
encoder for brain MRIs that infers missing sequences from available inputs and
can be adapted to various downstream applications. We demonstrate the
performance and robustness of our method against an MAE-ViT baseline in
downstream segmentation and classification tasks, showing absolute improvement
of $10.1$ overall Dice score and $0.46$ MCC over the baselines with missing
input sequences. Our experiments demonstrate the strength of this pretraining
strategy. The implementation is made available.

Motivation: 红外和可见光图像融合需要整合不同光谱域的互补结构纹理信息，现有方法缺乏对模态间交互的显式建模和任务关键区域的增强。

Method: 提出模态感知注意力机制动态调整特征贡献，像素级alpha混合模块学习空间变化融合权重，目标感知损失利用弱ROI监督保持语义一致性。

Conclusion: FusionNet为语义感知的多模态图像融合提供了通用可扩展的解决方案，有利于目标检测和场景理解等下游任务。

Abstract: Infrared and visible image fusion (IVIF) is a fundamental task in multi-modal
perception that aims to integrate complementary structural and textural cues
from different spectral domains. In this paper, we propose FusionNet, a novel
end-to-end fusion framework that explicitly models inter-modality interaction
and enhances task-critical regions. FusionNet introduces a modality-aware
attention mechanism that dynamically adjusts the contribution of infrared and
visible features based on their discriminative capacity. To achieve
fine-grained, interpretable fusion, we further incorporate a pixel-wise alpha
blending module, which learns spatially-varying fusion weights in an adaptive
and content-aware manner. Moreover, we formulate a target-aware loss that
leverages weak ROI supervision to preserve semantic consistency in regions
containing important objects (e.g., pedestrians, vehicles). Experiments on the
public M3FD dataset demonstrate that FusionNet generates fused images with
enhanced semantic preservation, high perceptual quality, and clear
interpretability. Our framework provides a general and extensible solution for
semantic-aware multi-modal image fusion, with benefits for downstream tasks
such as object detection and scene understanding.

Conclusion: 硬实例挖掘对计算病理学中的全幻灯片图像分析至关重要，MHIM-MIL框架通过有效挖掘困难实例显著提升了模型性能

Abstract: Digitizing pathological images into gigapixel Whole Slide Images (WSIs) has
opened new avenues for Computational Pathology (CPath). As positive tissue
comprises only a small fraction of gigapixel WSIs, existing Multiple Instance
Learning (MIL) methods typically focus on identifying salient instances via
attention mechanisms. However, this leads to a bias towards easy-to-classify
instances while neglecting challenging ones. Recent studies have shown that
hard examples are crucial for accurately modeling discriminative boundaries.
Applying such an idea at the instance level, we elaborate a novel MIL framework
with masked hard instance mining (MHIM-MIL), which utilizes a Siamese structure
with a consistency constraint to explore the hard instances. Using a
class-aware instance probability, MHIM-MIL employs a momentum teacher to mask
salient instances and implicitly mine hard instances for training the student
model. To obtain diverse, non-redundant hard instances, we adopt large-scale
random masking while utilizing a global recycle network to mitigate the risk of
losing key features. Furthermore, the student updates the teacher using an
exponential moving average, which identifies new hard instances for subsequent
training iterations and stabilizes optimization. Experimental results on cancer
diagnosis, subtyping, survival analysis tasks, and 12 benchmarks demonstrate
that MHIM-MIL outperforms the latest methods in both performance and
efficiency. The code is available at: https://github.com/DearCaat/MHIM-MIL.

Abstract: Camouflaged object detection (COD) aims to segment objects that blend into
their surroundings. However, most existing studies overlook the semantic
differences among textual prompts of different targets as well as fine-grained

Motivation: 识别到通用视觉-语言模型在GUI基础定位任务中表现不佳，虽然具有潜在的定位能力（Pointing Game验证），但在输出明确坐标时表现较差。需要避免高成本的精调方案。

Method: 提出三种零检验辅助推理方法：在输入图像中添加明确的空间线索，包括坐标轴、网格和标注交点，以激活VLM的隐式空间理解能力。

Conclusion: 通过简单的空间线索添加，可以有效激活VLM的隐式空间理解能力，为GUI基础定位任务提供了一种高效的零检验解决方案。

Abstract: Graphical user interface (GUI) grounding is a fundamental task for building
GUI agents. However, general vision-language models (VLMs) struggle with this
task due to a lack of specific optimization. We identify a key gap in this
paper: while VLMs exhibit significant latent grounding potential, as
demonstrated by their performance measured by Pointing Game, they underperform
when tasked with outputting explicit coordinates. To address this discrepancy,
and bypass the high data and annotation costs of current fine-tuning
approaches, we propose three zero-shot auxiliary reasoning methods. By
providing explicit spatial cues such as axes, grids and labeled intersections
as part of the input image, these methods enable VLMs to articulate their
implicit spatial understanding capabilities. We evaluate these methods on four
GUI grounding benchmarks across seven open-source and proprietary VLMs. The
evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed methods substantially improve
the performance of GUI grounding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于高斯的SLAM方法计算性能瓶颈严重（<20fps），远落后于几何中心方法（数百fps），主要原因是高斯建模需要大量计算和复杂优化

Method: 采用高斯-SDF混合表示：使用彩色SDF处理平滑几何和外观，用3D高斯捕捉细节；SDF通过RGB-D融合高效构建，高斯进行迭代优化

Result: 实现了50%的高斯数量减少和75%的优化迭代减少，在真实Azure Kinect序列上达到150+fps，速度提升一个数量级，重建质量相当

Conclusion: GPS-SLAM通过混合表示方法成功解决了高斯SLAM的计算瓶颈问题，实现了实时高性能3D重建，为未来研究提供了新思路

Abstract: While recent Gaussian-based SLAM methods achieve photorealistic
reconstruction from RGB-D data, their computational performance remains a
critical bottleneck. State-of-the-art techniques operate at less than 20 fps,
significantly lagging behind geometry-centric approaches like KinectFusion
(hundreds of fps). This limitation stems from the heavy computational burden:
modeling scenes requires numerous Gaussians and complex iterative optimization
to fit RGB-D data, where insufficient Gaussian counts or optimization
iterations cause severe quality degradation. To address this, we propose a
Gaussian-SDF hybrid representation, combining a colorized Signed Distance Field
(SDF) for smooth geometry and appearance with 3D Gaussians to capture
underrepresented details. The SDF is efficiently constructed via RGB-D fusion
(as in geometry-centric methods), while Gaussians undergo iterative
optimization. Our representation enables drastic Gaussian reduction (50% fewer)
by avoiding full-scene Gaussian modeling, and efficient Gaussian optimization
(75% fewer iterations) through targeted appearance refinement. Building upon
this representation, we develop GPS-SLAM (Gaussian-Plus-SDF SLAM), a real-time
3D reconstruction system achieving over 150 fps on real-world Azure Kinect
sequences -- delivering an order-of-magnitude speedup over state-of-the-art
techniques while maintaining comparable reconstruction quality. We will release
the source code and data to facilitate future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无监督跨模态行人重识别方法主要基于聚类的对比学习，但通常只关注簇内共性而忽略图像间的细粒度差异，需要更精细的特征表示方法

Method: 提出分层身份学习(HIL)框架：1）通过二次聚类为每个粗粒度簇生成多个记忆表示；2）多中心对比学习(MCCL)增强表征；3）双向反向选择传输(BRST)机制建立可靠的跨模态对应关系

Result: 在SYSU-MM01和RegDB数据集上的大量实验表明，该方法优于现有方法

Conclusion: HIL框架通过捕捉细粒度差异和建立可靠的跨模态对应，有效提升了无监督可见光-红外行人重识别的性能

Abstract: Unsupervised visible-infrared person re-identification (USVI-ReID) aims to
learn modality-invariant image features from unlabeled cross-modal person
datasets by reducing the modality gap while minimizing reliance on costly
manual annotations. Existing methods typically address USVI-ReID using
cluster-based contrastive learning, which represents a person by a single
cluster center. However, they primarily focus on the commonality of images
within each cluster while neglecting the finer-grained differences among them.
To address the limitation, we propose a Hierarchical Identity Learning (HIL)
framework. Since each cluster may contain several smaller sub-clusters that
reflect fine-grained variations among images, we generate multiple memories for
each existing coarse-grained cluster via a secondary clustering. Additionally,
we propose Multi-Center Contrastive Learning (MCCL) to refine representations
for enhancing intra-modal clustering and minimizing cross-modal discrepancies.
To further improve cross-modal matching quality, we design a Bidirectional
Reverse Selection Transmission (BRST) mechanism, which establishes reliable
cross-modal correspondences by performing bidirectional matching of
pseudo-labels. Extensive experiments conducted on the SYSU-MM01 and RegDB
datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在安全关键场景中，某些类别（如'人类'）需要比其它类别（如'狗'）更高的识别准确率。传统均匀分布无法满足这种需求，需要一种能够优化类别分布的方法来减少偏差和方差。

Method: 提出BiCDO框架，迭代地识别帕累托最优的类别分布，确定每个类别的最佳图像数量。该方法可以与现有训练流程集成，只需最小代码改动，支持任何标注的多类数据集。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和iNaturalist21数据集上使用EfficientNet、ResNet和ConvNeXt进行验证，显示通过优化数据分布实现了改进且平衡的模型性能。

Conclusion: BiCDO提供了一种有效的数据中心化方法，能够通过优化类别分布来提升多类图像分类的性能，特别适用于需要优先处理特定类别的应用场景。

Abstract: We propose BiCDO (Bias-Controlled Class Distribution Optimizer), an
iterative, data-centric framework that identifies Pareto optimized class
distributions for multi-class image classification. BiCDO enables performance
prioritization for specific classes, which is useful in safety-critical
scenarios (e.g. prioritizing 'Human' over 'Dog'). Unlike uniform distributions,
BiCDO determines the optimal number of images per class to enhance reliability
and minimize bias and variance in the objective function. BiCDO can be
incorporated into existing training pipelines with minimal code changes and
supports any labelled multi-class dataset. We have validated BiCDO using
EfficientNet, ResNet and ConvNeXt on CIFAR-10 and iNaturalist21 datasets,
demonstrating improved, balanced model performance through optimized data
distribution.

Result: 实验表明MVQA-68K显著提升了各种多模态大语言模型在VQA任务上的性能，在内部测试集和公共基准测试（LSVQ-test、LSVQ-1080p、LIVE-VQC）上都达到了最先进水平。在VQA训练中加入显式推理过程大幅提升了零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: MVQA-68K数据集通过多维度评估和链式思维推理，为视频质量评估提供了更全面和可解释的解决方案，有效提升了模型的性能表现和泛化能力。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of video generation models such as Sora, video
quality assessment (VQA) is becoming increasingly crucial for selecting
high-quality videos from large-scale datasets used in pre-training. Traditional
VQA methods, typically producing single numerical scores, often lack
comprehensiveness and interpretability. To address these challenges, we
introduce MVQA-68K, a novel multi-dimensional VQA dataset comprising over
68,000 carefully annotated videos, covering seven essential quality dimensions:
overall aesthetics, camera movement, dynamic degree, texture detail,
composition, visual quality, and factual consistency. Each annotation includes
detailed chain-of-thought reasoning to facilitate interpretability and
comprehensive understanding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MVQA-68K
significantly enhances the performance of various multimodal large language
models (MLLMs) on the VQA task, achieving state-of-the-art results not only on
our internal test set (Fig.1) but also on public benchmarks including
LSVQ-test, LSVQ-1080p, and LIVE-VQC. Meantime, incorporating explicit reasoning
process during VQA training substantially boosts the zero-shot generalization.

### [80] [Disentangling Content from Style to Overcome Shortcut Learning: A Hybrid Generative-Discriminative Learning Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11598)
*Siming Fu,Sijun Dong,Xiaoliang Meng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出HyGDL混合生成-判别学习框架，通过内容-风格解耦解决自监督学习中的捷径学习问题，基于不变性预训练原则强制模型学习不变本质。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自监督学习存在捷径学习问题，模型倾向于利用表面特征而非内在结构，这是导致跨域泛化失败的根本原因。现有方法只在表面层面对齐或分离域特定特征，未能改变产生捷径依赖的底层学习机制。

Method: 提出HyGDL混合框架，基于不变性预训练原则：通过系统性地改变输入中的偏差（如风格）同时保持监督信号不变，强制模型学习不变本质。使用单一编码器，通过向量投影分析定义风格为表示中与风格不变内容正交的分量。

Result: 实现了显式的内容-风格解耦，解决了生成式方法（如MAE）和判别式方法中存在的系统性捷径学习问题。

Conclusion: HyGDL框架从根本上解决了自监督学习的捷径依赖问题，通过不变性预训练原则实现了更好的跨域泛化能力。

Abstract: Despite the remarkable success of Self-Supervised Learning (SSL), its
generalization is fundamentally hindered by Shortcut Learning, where models
exploit superficial features like texture instead of intrinsic structure. We
experimentally verify this flaw within the generative paradigm (e.g., MAE) and
argue it is a systemic issue also affecting discriminative methods, identifying
it as the root cause of their failure on unseen domains. While existing methods
often tackle this at a surface level by aligning or separating domain-specific
features, they fail to alter the underlying learning mechanism that fosters
shortcut dependency. To address this at its core, we propose HyGDL (Hybrid
Generative-Discriminative Learning Framework), a hybrid framework that achieves
explicit content-style disentanglement. Our approach is guided by the
Invariance Pre-training Principle: forcing a model to learn an invariant
essence by systematically varying a bias (e.g., style) at the input while
keeping the supervision signal constant. HyGDL operates on a single encoder and
analytically defines style as the component of a representation that is
orthogonal to its style-invariant content, derived via vector projection.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了基于softmax的帧分配策略，构建了图像和视频双基准测试，在UCF-Crime数据集上实现了帧级和视频级异常检测性能的提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视频异常检测基准测试局限于帧级或视频级任务，无法全面评估模型泛化能力，需要构建更全面的评估体系

Method: 提出softmax帧分配策略，优先选择异常密集片段同时保持全视频覆盖；构建图像基准测试（帧级推理）和视频基准测试（时序定位和异常评分）

Result: 在UCF-Crime数据集上，帧级和视频级检测性能均有提升；消融实验证明异常聚焦采样优于均匀和随机采样基线

Conclusion: 提出的采样策略和双基准测试框架能够更全面地评估视频异常检测模型，为未来研究提供更好的评估标准

Abstract: Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) is critical for surveillance and public safety.
However, existing benchmarks are limited to either frame-level or video-level
tasks, restricting a holistic view of model generalization. This work first
introduces a softmax-based frame allocation strategy that prioritizes
anomaly-dense segments while maintaining full-video coverage, enabling balanced
sampling across temporal scales. Building on this process, we construct two
complementary benchmarks. The image-based benchmark evaluates frame-level
reasoning with representative frames, while the video-based benchmark extends
to temporally localized segments and incorporates an abnormality scoring
task.Experiments on UCF-Crime demonstrate improvements at both the frame and
video levels, and ablation studies confirm clear advantages of anomaly-focused
sampling over uniform and random baselines.

TL;DR: 基于3D高斯拖散的新型3D深度伪造框架，支持多视角一致的面部替换和重现，充分利用3D高斯拖散技术进行操纶攻击


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统2D深度伪造方法在几何不一致性和新视角通用性方面的限制，提供更具控制性和氛围感的3D演示效果

Method: 结合参数化头部模型与动态高斯表示，明确分离头部和背景高斯，使用预训练2D指导优化面部区域，并主动修复极端姿势和表情下的视觉一致性

Result: 在NeRSemble和额外评估视频上达到了与最先进2D方法相当的身份保持、姿势和表情一致性，同时在多视角渲染质量和3D一致性方面显著超过它们

Conclusion: 该方法填补了3D建模与深度伪造合成之间的空白，为场景感知、可控制和沉浸式视觉伪造开启了新方向，同时也揭示了3D高斯拖散技术可能被用于操纶攻击的风险

Abstract: We propose a novel 3D deepfake generation framework based on 3D Gaussian
Splatting that enables realistic, identity-preserving face swapping and
reenactment in a fully controllable 3D space. Compared to conventional 2D
deepfake approaches that suffer from geometric inconsistencies and limited
generalization to novel view, our method combines a parametric head model with
dynamic Gaussian representations to support multi-view consistent rendering,
precise expression control, and seamless background integration. To address
editing challenges in point-based representations, we explicitly separate the
head and background Gaussians and use pre-trained 2D guidance to optimize the
facial region across views. We further introduce a repair module to enhance
visual consistency under extreme poses and expressions. Experiments on
NeRSemble and additional evaluation videos demonstrate that our method achieves
comparable performance to state-of-the-art 2D approaches in identity
preservation, as well as pose and expression consistency, while significantly
outperforming them in multi-view rendering quality and 3D consistency. Our
approach bridges the gap between 3D modeling and deepfake synthesis, enabling
new directions for scene-aware, controllable, and immersive visual forgeries,
revealing the threat that emerging 3D Gaussian Splatting technique could be
used for manipulation attacks.

*Yongzhe Lyu,Yu Wu,Yutian Lin,Bo Du*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IS-Diff是一种无需训练的扩散模型修复方法，通过从非掩码区域采样初始种子来模拟掩码数据分布，解决传统随机初始化导致的语义不匹配问题，提高修复的一致性和连贯性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统扩散模型在修复任务中使用随机初始化种子，可能导致掩码区域引入不匹配的语义信息，造成修复结果存在偏差、一致性低和与非掩码区域不连贯的问题。

Method: 提出IS-Diff方法：1）使用从非掩码区域采样的分布和谐种子作为初始种子；2）引入动态选择性精炼机制，检测中间潜在空间中的严重不和谐修复并动态调整初始化先验强度。

Result: 在CelebA-HQ、ImageNet和Places2数据集上的标准和大掩码修复任务中，IS-Diff在所有指标上都优于最先进的修复方法。

Conclusion: IS-Diff通过使用分布和谐的初始种子和动态精炼机制，有效解决了扩散模型修复中的语义不匹配问题，无需额外训练即可实现高质量的图像修复。

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown promising results in free-form inpainting. Recent
studies based on refined diffusion samplers or novel architectural designs led
to realistic results and high data consistency. However, random initialization
seed (noise) adopted in vanilla diffusion process may introduce mismatched
semantic information in masked regions, leading to biased inpainting results,
e.g., low consistency and low coherence with the other unmasked area. To
address this issue, we propose the Initial Seed refined Diffusion Model
(IS-Diff), a completely training-free approach incorporating distributional
harmonious seeds to produce harmonious results. Specifically, IS-Diff employs
initial seeds sampled from unmasked areas to imitate the masked data
distribution, thereby setting a promising direction for the diffusion
procedure. Moreover, a dynamic selective refinement mechanism is proposed to
detect severe unharmonious inpaintings in intermediate latent and adjust the
strength of our initialization prior dynamically. We validate our method on
both standard and large-mask inpainting tasks using the CelebA-HQ, ImageNet,
and Places2 datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness across all metrics
compared to state-of-the-art inpainting methods.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一个真实世界的全能天气图像恢复数据集WeatherBench，解决了现有治理方法在混合天气条件下的域差距问题和缺乏真实数据的瓶颈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的全能天气图像恢复方法主要基于合成数据训练，存在显著的分辨率、风格和域特征差异，导致域差距问题，同时缺乏大规模真实世界数据集。

Method: 构建了一个包含雨、雪、霏等多种天气条件的真实世界图像对数据集，涵盖多样的户外场景和照明设置，提供精确对齐的污染图像和清潔图像对。

Result: 在新数据集上进行了全面的实验，对比了任务特定、任务通用和全能恢复方法的表现，为预计模型提供了可靠的评估基准。

Conclusion: 该数据集为推进真实世界场景下的健壮和实用全能图像恢复技术提供了价值较高的基础，已公开发布。

Abstract: Existing all-in-one image restoration approaches, which aim to handle
multiple weather degradations within a single framework, are predominantly
trained and evaluated using mixed single-weather synthetic datasets. However,
these datasets often differ significantly in resolution, style, and domain
characteristics, leading to substantial domain gaps that hinder the development
and fair evaluation of unified models. Furthermore, the lack of a large-scale,
real-world all-in-one weather restoration dataset remains a critical bottleneck
in advancing this field. To address these limitations, we present a real-world
all-in-one adverse weather image restoration benchmark dataset, which contains
image pairs captured under various weather conditions, including rain, snow,
and haze, as well as diverse outdoor scenes and illumination settings. The
resulting dataset provides precisely aligned degraded and clean images,
enabling supervised learning and rigorous evaluation. We conduct comprehensive
experiments by benchmarking a variety of task-specific, task-general, and
all-in-one restoration methods on our dataset. Our dataset offers a valuable
foundation for advancing robust and practical all-in-one image restoration in
real-world scenarios. The dataset has been publicly released and is available

Motivation: 当前基于2D的视网膜血管分割方法精度不足，且现有OCTA联合分割模型在不同任务间存在性能不平衡问题。

Method: 集成多特征提取模块与Mamba状态空间模型的RVMamba架构，以及统一的Joint-OCTAMamba框架来同时改善FAZ分割并缓解性能不平衡。

Result: 在OCTA-500数据集上的实验结果表明，Joint-OCTAMamba在所有评估指标上都优于现有模型。

Conclusion: 提出的联合分割框架有效提升了OCTA图像分析的准确性和平衡性，为视网膜疾病诊断提供了更好的工具。

Abstract: OCTA is a crucial non-invasive imaging technique for diagnosing and
monitoring retinal diseases like diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular
degeneration, and glaucoma. Current 2D-based methods for retinal vessel (RV)
segmentation offer insufficient accuracy. To address this, we propose RVMamba,
a novel architecture integrating multiple feature extraction modules with the
Mamba state-space model. Moreover, existing joint segmentation models for OCTA
data exhibit performance imbalance between different tasks. To simultaneously
improve the segmentation of the foveal avascular zone (FAZ) and mitigate this
imbalance, we introduce FAZMamba and a unified Joint-OCTAMamba framework.
Experimental results on the OCTA-500 dataset demonstrate that Joint-OCTAMamba
outperforms existing models across evaluation metrics.The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能餐具清洁在食品安全和智能家居中至关重要，但现有方法受限于粗粒度分类和少样本数据稀缺，难以满足工业化需求。

Method: 采用基于生成扩散模型的少样本数据增强方案DTGen，通过LoRA实现领域专业化，结构化提示生成多样化脏污图像，CLIP跨模态过滤保证数据质量。

Result: 在极有限的真实少样本条件下，DTGen能合成几乎无限的高质量样本，显著提升分类器性能，支持细粒度脏餐具识别。

Conclusion: DTGen不仅验证了生成式AI在少样本工业视觉中的价值，还为自动化餐具清洁和食品安全监控提供了可行的部署路径。

Abstract: Intelligent tableware cleaning is a critical application in food safety and
smart homes, but existing methods are limited by coarse-grained classification
and scarcity of few-shot data, making it difficult to meet industrialization
requirements. We propose DTGen, a few-shot data augmentation scheme based on
generative diffusion models, specifically designed for fine-grained dirty
tableware recognition. DTGen achieves efficient domain specialization through
LoRA, generates diverse dirty images via structured prompts, and ensures data
quality through CLIP-based cross-modal filtering. Under extremely limited real
few-shot conditions, DTGen can synthesize virtually unlimited high-quality
samples, significantly improving classifier performance and supporting
fine-grained dirty tableware recognition. We further elaborate on lightweight
deployment strategies, promising to transfer DTGen's benefits to embedded
dishwashers and integrate with cleaning programs to intelligently regulate
energy consumption and detergent usage. Research results demonstrate that DTGen
not only validates the value of generative AI in few-shot industrial vision but
also provides a feasible deployment path for automated tableware cleaning and
food safety monitoring.

TL;DR: MindVL是基于昇腾NPU训练的多模态大语言模型，采用原生分辨率视觉Transformer处理可变分辨率图像，避免固定分辨率分块导致的性能下降，在训练数据仅为Qwen2.5-VL 1/10的情况下达到同等性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发专门针对昇腾NPU优化的多模态大语言模型，解决固定分辨率图像处理导致的细节丢失问题，提升对视觉密集内容（如复杂图表）的理解能力

Method: 采用原生分辨率Vision Transformer处理可变分辨率图像；开发Mindspeed-MLLM分布式训练框架；实施三阶段训练（预热、多任务训练、监督指令调优）；使用多模态数据打包和混合并行技术；引入测试时分辨率搜索和模型权重平均

Result: 在训练数据仅为Qwen2.5-VL 1/10的情况下，MindVL在通用多模态理解和文档/表格理解评估中达到与Qwen2.5-VL相当的性能，在OCR评估中表现领先

Conclusion: MindVL证明了在昇腾NPU上高效训练高性能多模态大语言模型的可行性，原生分辨率处理和优化的训练框架使其能够以更少的数据达到先进模型的性能水平

Abstract: We propose MindVL, a multimodal large langauge model trained on Ascend NPUs.
Similar to Qwen2.5-VL, MindVL adopts native-resolution Vision Transformers,
which enables it to process images at their original variable resolutions. This
design avoids the degradation caused by fixed-resolution tiling while
preserving fine-grained details and global layouts, which is crucial for
visually dense content such as complex charts and diagrams. To ensure the
smooth training of MindVL on Ascend NPUs, we develop Mindspeed-MLLM, a
distributed multimodal training framework tailored for Ascend NPUs. To maintain
training accuracy, we implement equivalent replacements for certain operators.
MindVL undergoes a three-phase training process, namely the warm-up phase,
multitask training phase, and supervised instruction tuning phase, to gradually
enhance its capabilities. This process starts with basic visual and multimodal
pre-training, followed by large-scale multiask trainging and instruction
tuning. We also adopt multimodal data packaging and hybrid parallelism
techniques, which significantly improve end-to-end training speed. To further
boost model performance, we specifically introduce test-time resolution search
and model weight averaging. Notably, despite using about 1/10 of the training
data required by Qwen2.5-VL, MindVL achieves performance on par with Qwen2.5-VL
in evaluations of general multimodal understanding and document/table
comprehension. Beyond overall scores, MindVL also delivers leading performance
in OCR assessments.

routing engine. We evaluate the full end-to-end pipeline as well as individual
components, showing that the approach can robustly recover trail networks from
diverse map styles and generate GPS routes suitable for practical use.

Method: 创建包含45个真实工业零件的IMD数据集，使用RGB-D相机在自然室内光照和不同物体布置下采集数据，支持视频对象分割、6D位姿跟踪和单次6D位姿估计三个任务

Result: 评估显示工业数据集比家用物体数据集更具挑战性，为开发适用于工业机器人场景的分割和位姿估计算法提供了基准

Conclusion: IMD数据集填补了工业金属物体6D位姿估计的空白，为算法在真实工业环境中的泛化能力提供了重要基准

Abstract: Object 6DoF (6D) pose estimation is essential for robotic perception,
especially in industrial settings. It enables robots to interact with the
environment and manipulate objects. However, existing benchmarks on object 6D
pose estimation primarily use everyday objects with rich textures and
low-reflectivity, limiting model generalization to industrial scenarios where
objects are often metallic, texture-less, and highly reflective. To address
this gap, we propose a novel dataset and benchmark namely \textit{Industrial
Metallic Dataset (IMD)}, tailored for industrial applications. Our dataset
comprises 45 true-to-scale industrial components, captured with an RGB-D camera
under natural indoor lighting and varied object arrangements to replicate
real-world conditions. The benchmark supports three tasks, including video
object segmentation, 6D pose tracking, and one-shot 6D pose estimation. We
evaluate existing state-of-the-art models, including XMem and SAM2 for
segmentation, and BundleTrack and BundleSDF for pose estimation, to assess
model performance in industrial contexts. Evaluation results show that our
industrial dataset is more challenging than existing household object datasets.
This benchmark provides the baseline for developing and comparing segmentation
and pose estimation algorithms that better generalize to industrial robotics
scenarios.

Motivation: 医学图像分割中的不确定性估计至关重要，但传统Deep Ensembles方法训练和测试成本随集成数量增加而显著上升

Method: 使用Ensemble Distillation技术，将多个集成模型的知识蒸馏到单一模型中

Result: 在DRIVE和FIVES数据集上实验表明，该方法在校准和分割指标上达到可比性能，同时大幅降低计算复杂度

Conclusion: Ensemble Distillation为视网膜血管分割中的不确定性估计提供了高效可靠的方法，在医学成像应用中具有广阔前景

Abstract: Uncertainty estimation is critical for reliable medical image segmentation,
particularly in retinal vessel analysis, where accurate predictions are
essential for diagnostic applications. Deep Ensembles, where multiple networks
are trained individually, are widely used to improve medical image segmentation
performance. However, training and testing costs increase with the number of
ensembles. In this work, we propose Ensemble Distillation as a robust
alternative to commonly used uncertainty estimation techniques by distilling
the knowledge of multiple ensemble models into a single model. Through
extensive experiments on the DRIVE and FIVES datasets, we demonstrate that
Ensemble Distillation achieves comparable performance via calibration and
segmentation metrics, while significantly reducing computational complexity.
These findings suggest that Ensemble distillation provides an efficient and
reliable approach for uncertainty estimation in the segmentation of the retinal
vessels, making it a promising tool for medical imaging applications.

TL;DR: 研究发现深度可分离卷积网络本质上收敛到仅8个通用滤波器，这些滤波器是高斯差、高斯及其导数等基础空间算子，网络使用这些冻结滤波器即可达到80%以上ImageNet准确率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展"主密钥滤波器假设"，探究深度可分离卷积网络是否真正需要数千个不同滤波器，还是存在更基础的通用滤波器集

Method: 通过系统性无监督搜索，在不同架构和数据集上提取通用滤波器模式，分析传统DS-CNN滤波器的数学关系

Result: 发现传统DS-CNN的数千个滤波器主要是8个通用滤波器的线性变换，使用这8个冻结滤波器即可达到80%+ ImageNet准确率，在小数据集上甚至优于可训练参数模型

Conclusion: 深度卷积层天然趋向于这组基础空间算子，与任务或架构无关，这为理解泛化和迁移学习提供了新视角

Abstract: A recent study has proposed the "Master Key Filters Hypothesis" for
convolutional neural network filters. This paper extends this hypothesis by
radically constraining its scope to a single set of just 8 universal filters
that depthwise separable convolutional networks inherently converge to. While
conventional DS-CNNs employ thousands of distinct trained filters, our analysis
reveals these filters are predominantly linear shifts (ax+b) of our discovered
universal set. Through systematic unsupervised search, we extracted these
fundamental patterns across different architectures and datasets. Remarkably,
networks initialized with these 8 unique frozen filters achieve over 80%
ImageNet accuracy, and even outperform models with thousands of trainable
parameters when applied to smaller datasets. The identified master key filters
closely match Difference of Gaussians (DoGs), Gaussians, and their derivatives,
structures that are not only fundamental to classical image processing but also
strikingly similar to receptive fields in mammalian visual systems. Our
findings provide compelling evidence that depthwise convolutional layers
naturally gravitate toward this fundamental set of spatial operators regardless
of task or architecture. This work offers new insights for understanding
generalization and transfer learning through the universal language of these
master key filters.

Abstract: This technical report documents the development of novel Layout Analysis
models integrated into the Docling document-conversion pipeline. We trained
several state-of-the-art object detectors based on the RT-DETR, RT-DETRv2 and
DFINE architectures on a heterogeneous corpus of 150,000 documents (both openly

detections to make them more applicable to the document conversion task. We
evaluated the effectiveness of the layout analysis on various document
benchmarks using different methodologies while also measuring the runtime
performance across different environments (CPU, Nvidia and Apple GPUs). We
introduce five new document layout models achieving 20.6% - 23.9% mAP
improvement over Docling's previous baseline, with comparable or better
runtime. Our best model, "heron-101", attains 78% mAP with 28 ms/image
inference time on a single NVIDIA A100 GPU. Extensive quantitative and
qualitative experiments establish best practices for training, evaluating, and
deploying document-layout detectors, providing actionable guidance for the
document conversion community. All trained checkpoints, code, and documentation

Conclusion: MISRA是朝着计算机辅助和机器人显微手术可靠场景解析迈出的有希望的一步，为微手术器械分割提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of thin structures is critical for microsurgical scene
understanding but remains challenging due to resolution loss, low contrast, and
class imbalance. We propose Microsurgery Instrument Segmentation for Robotic
Assistance(MISRA), a segmentation framework that augments RGB input with
luminance channels, integrates skip attention to preserve elongated features,
and employs an Iterative Feedback Module(IFM) for continuity restoration across
multiple passes. In addition, we introduce a dedicated microsurgical dataset
with fine-grained annotations of surgical instruments including thin objects,
providing a benchmark for robust evaluation Dataset available at
https://huggingface.co/datasets/KIST-HARILAB/MISAW-Seg. Experiments demonstrate
that MISRA achieves competitive performance, improving the mean class IoU by
5.37% over competing methods, while delivering more stable predictions at
instrument contacts and overlaps. These results position MISRA as a promising
step toward reliable scene parsing for computer-assisted and robotic
microsurgery.

TL;DR: DGMap是一个用于地图推断的双解码框架，通过多尺度网格编码、掩码增强关键点提取和全局上下文感知关系预测，解决了轨迹密度不均导致的道路碎片化和冗余段问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 轨迹数据成本低、覆盖广、持续可用，但密度不均导致稀疏区域道路碎片化和密集区域冗余段，现有方法面临挑战。

Method: 提出DGMap双解码框架，包含多尺度网格编码、掩码增强关键点提取和全局上下文感知关系预测模块，整合全局语义上下文与局部几何特征。

Result: 在三个真实数据集上实验表明，DGMap在APLS指标上优于最先进方法5%，在滴滴出行平台轨迹数据上表现尤为突出。

Conclusion: DGMap通过全局上下文感知有效提升了稀疏区域关键点检测精度并抑制了密集区域的错误连接，显著改善了地图推断性能。

Abstract: Trajectory data has become a key resource for automated map in-ference due to
its low cost, broad coverage, and continuous availability. However, uneven
trajectory density often leads to frag-mented roads in sparse areas and
redundant segments in dense regions, posing significant challenges for existing
methods. To address these issues, we propose DGMap, a dual-decoding framework
with global context awareness, featuring Multi-scale Grid Encoding,
Mask-enhanced Keypoint Extraction, and Global Context-aware Relation
Prediction. By integrating global semantic context with local geometric
features, DGMap improves keypoint detection accuracy to reduce road
fragmentation in sparse-trajectory areas. Additionally, the Global
Context-aware Relation Prediction module suppresses false connections in
dense-trajectory regions by modeling long-range trajectory patterns.
Experimental results on three real-world datasets show that DGMap outperforms
state-of-the-art methods by 5% in APLS, with notable performance gains on
trajectory data from the Didi Chuxing platform

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) that can effectively learn ultrasound
representations by integrating multi-source data holds significant promise for
advancing clinical care. However, the scarcity of large labeled datasets in
real-world clinical environments and the limited generalizability of
task-specific models have hindered the development of generalizable clinical AI
models for ultrasound applications. In this study, we present EchoCare, a novel
ultrasound foundation model for generalist clinical use, developed via
self-supervised learning on our curated, publicly available, large-scale
dataset EchoCareData. EchoCareData comprises 4.5 million ultrasound images,
sourced from over 23 countries across 5 continents and acquired via a diverse
range of distinct imaging devices, thus encompassing global cohorts that are
multi-center, multi-device, and multi-ethnic. Unlike prior studies that adopt
off-the-shelf vision foundation model architectures, we introduce a
hierarchical classifier into EchoCare to enable joint learning of pixel-level
and representation-level features, capturing both global anatomical contexts
and local ultrasound characteristics. With minimal training, EchoCare
outperforms state-of-the-art comparison models across 10 representative
ultrasound benchmarks of varying diagnostic difficulties, spanning disease
diagnosis, lesion segmentation, organ detection, landmark prediction,
quantitative regression, imaging enhancement and report generation. The code
and pretrained model are publicly released, rendering EchoCare accessible for
fine-tuning and local adaptation, supporting extensibility to additional
applications. EchoCare provides a fully open and generalizable foundation model
to boost the development of AI technologies for diverse clinical ultrasound
applications.

Method: 提出MSMA框架，结合多尺度特征融合和多属性学习，利用大内核注意力模块提升不同尺度下的特征提取精度，从单张2D图像中估计准确的3D面部参数

Conclusion: 该方法通过多尺度特征融合和多属性学习有效解决了无约束环境下3D人脸重建的挑战，在减少对3D标注数据依赖的同时提高了重建的详细程度和准确性

Abstract: Reconstructing 3D face from a single unconstrained image remains a
challenging problem due to diverse conditions in unconstrained environments.
Recently, learning-based methods have achieved notable results by effectively
capturing complex facial structures and details across varying conditions.
Consequently, many existing approaches employ projection-based losses between
generated and input images to constrain model training. However, learning-based
methods for 3D face reconstruction typically require substantial amounts of 3D
facial data, which is difficult and costly to obtain. Consequently, to reduce
reliance on labeled 3D face datasets, many existing approaches employ
projection-based losses between generated and input images to constrain model
training. Nonetheless, despite these advancements, existing approaches
frequently struggle to capture detailed and multi-scale features under diverse
facial attributes and conditions, leading to incomplete or less accurate
reconstructions. In this paper, we propose a Multi-Scale Feature Fusion with
Multi-Attribute (MSMA) framework for 3D face reconstruction from unconstrained
images. Our method integrates multi-scale feature fusion with a focus on
multi-attribute learning and leverages a large-kernel attention module to
enhance the precision of feature extraction across scales, enabling accurate 3D
facial parameter estimation from a single 2D image. Comprehensive experiments
on the MICC Florence, Facewarehouse and custom-collect datasets demonstrate
that our approach achieves results on par with current state-of-the-art
methods, and in some instances, surpasses SOTA performance across challenging
conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基础模型如SAM2在视频分割方面表现出强大的零样本泛化能力，但直接应用于多目标跟踪分割(MOTS)时存在身份管理和内存效率不足的问题，需要开发更有效的解决方案。

Method: 提出Seg2Track-SAM2框架，集成预训练目标检测器与SAM2，引入Seg2Track模块处理轨迹初始化、管理和强化，采用滑动窗口内存策略减少内存使用，无需微调且检测器无关。

Result: 在KITTI MOT和KITTI MOTS基准测试中达到最先进性能，在KITTI MOTS汽车和行人类别中排名第四，关联精度(AssA)创下新纪录，内存使用减少75%且性能下降可忽略。

Conclusion: Seg2Track-SAM2通过结合强大的零样本跟踪、增强的身份保持和高效内存利用，推动了MOTS技术的发展，支持在资源受限环境下的部署。

Abstract: Autonomous systems require robust Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) capabilities to
operate reliably in dynamic environments. MOT ensures consistent object
identity assignment and precise spatial delineation. Recent advances in
foundation models, such as SAM2, have demonstrated strong zero-shot
generalization for video segmentation, but their direct application to MOTS
(MOT+Segmentation) remains limited by insufficient identity management and
memory efficiency. This work introduces Seg2Track-SAM2, a framework that
integrates pre-trained object detectors with SAM2 and a novel Seg2Track module
to address track initialization, track management, and reinforcement. The
proposed approach requires no fine-tuning and remains detector-agnostic.
Experimental results on KITTI MOT and KITTI MOTS benchmarks show that
Seg2Track-SAM2 achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, ranking fourth
overall in both car and pedestrian classes on KITTI MOTS, while establishing a
new benchmark in association accuracy (AssA). Furthermore, a sliding-window
memory strategy reduces memory usage by up to 75% with negligible performance
degradation, supporting deployment under resource constraints. These results
confirm that Seg2Track-SAM2 advances MOTS by combining robust zero-shot
tracking, enhanced identity preservation, and efficient memory utilization. The

Method: 在SA-UNet基础上，为所有跳跃连接注入跨尺度空间注意力以增强多尺度特征融合，并采用加权BCE+MCC损失函数来提高对类别不平衡的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Retinal vessel segmentation is essential for early diagnosis of diseases such
as diabetic retinopathy, hypertension, and neurodegenerative disorders.
Although SA-UNet introduces spatial attention in the bottleneck, it underuses
attention in skip connections and does not address the severe
foreground-background imbalance. We propose SA-UNetv2, a lightweight model that
injects cross-scale spatial attention into all skip connections to strengthen
multi-scale feature fusion and adopts a weighted Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE)
plus Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) loss to improve robustness to class
imbalance. On the public DRIVE and STARE datasets, SA-UNetv2 achieves
state-of-the-art performance with only 1.2MB memory and 0.26M parameters (less

we propose FineQuest, the first training-free framework that leverages
dual-mode reasoning inspired by cognitive science: i) Reactive Reasoning for

domain-specific sports understanding, FineQuest incorporates SSGraph, a
multimodal sports knowledge scene graph spanning nine sports, which encodes
both visual instances and domain-specific terminology to enhance reasoning
accuracy. Furthermore, we introduce two new sports VideoQA benchmarks, Gym-QA

Motivation: 现有医学图像诊断模型使用简化的one-hot标签，忽略了诊断不确定性和评分者变异，导致模型过于自信的预测

Method: 利用神经网络训练动态(NNTD)评估每个训练样本的内在难度，通过聚合和校准训练过程中的模型预测来生成不确定性感知伪标签

Result: 在心超分类测试集上表现优异，在校准、选择性分类和多视图融合方面超过专门的基线方法

Conclusion: 该框架能够将不确定性重新引入标签空间，提高医学图像诊断模型的检验性和稳健性，且无需修改网络架构

Abstract: Computer-aided diagnosis systems must make critical decisions from medical
images that are often noisy, ambiguous, or conflicting, yet today's models are
trained on overly simplistic labels that ignore diagnostic uncertainty. One-hot
labels erase inter-rater variability and force models to make overconfident
predictions, especially when faced with incomplete or artifact-laden inputs. We
address this gap by introducing a novel framework that brings uncertainty back
into the label space. Our method leverages neural network training dynamics
(NNTD) to assess the inherent difficulty of each training sample. By
aggregating and calibrating model predictions during training, we generate
uncertainty-aware pseudo-labels that reflect the ambiguity encountered during
learning. This label augmentation approach is architecture-agnostic and can be
applied to any supervised learning pipeline to enhance uncertainty estimation
and robustness. We validate our approach on a challenging echocardiography
classification benchmark, demonstrating superior performance over specialized
baselines in calibration, selective classification, and multi-view fusion.

Conclusion: LFRA-Net在分割精度和计算成本之间达到了理想平衡，特别适合资源受限的实时临床应用

Abstract: Retinal vessel segmentation is critical for the early diagnosis of
vision-threatening and systemic diseases, especially in real-world clinical
settings with limited computational resources. Although significant
improvements have been made in deep learning-based segmentation methods,
current models still face challenges in extracting tiny vessels and suffer from
high computational costs. In this study, we present LFRA-Net by incorporating
focal modulation attention at the encoder-decoder bottleneck and region-aware
attention in the selective skip connections. LFRA-Net is a lightweight network
optimized for precise and effective retinal vascular segmentation. It enhances
feature representation and regional focus by efficiently capturing local and
global dependencies. LFRA-Net outperformed many state-of-the-art models while
maintaining lightweight characteristics with only 0.17 million parameters, 0.66
MB memory size, and 10.50 GFLOPs. We validated it on three publicly available
datasets: DRIVE, STARE, and CHASE\_DB. It performed better in terms of Dice
score (84.28\%, 88.44\%, and 85.50\%) and Jaccard index (72.86\%, 79.31\%, and
74.70\%) on the DRIVE, STARE, and CHASE\_DB datasets, respectively. LFRA-Net
provides an ideal ratio between segmentation accuracy and computational cost
compared to existing deep learning methods, which makes it suitable for
real-time clinical applications in areas with limited resources. The code can

Motivation: 传统推测解码直接应用于视觉语言模型时面临系统约束：视觉token数量随图像分辨率和视频长度增加，导致计算和内存开销巨大，特别是KV缓存

Method: 建立EAGLE-2风格基线EagleVLM，使用弹性视觉压缩器自适应选择剪枝、池化、卷积和重采样原语，提出在线logit蒸馏协议训练草稿模型

Result: 在LLaVA和MMMU上实现2.5-2.9倍端到端加速，保持目标模型输出分布的无损解码，训练时间延长可单调提高草稿模型平均接受长度

Conclusion: SpecVLM为视觉语言模型提供了一种实用的推测解码解决方案，通过系统优化和在线训练协议实现了显著加速效果

Abstract: Speculative decoding is a powerful way to accelerate autoregressive large
language models (LLMs), but directly porting it to vision-language models
(VLMs) faces unique systems constraints: the prefill stage is dominated by
visual tokens whose count scales with image resolution and video length,
inflating both compute and memory, especially the key-value (KV) cache. We
study speculative decoding for VLMs and introduce SpecVLM, a practical system
that (1) establishes a strong EAGLE-2-style baseline, EagleVLM, delivering
1.5--2.3x end-to-end speedups over full autoregressive inference, and (2)
further accelerates VLM inference with an elastic visual compressor that
adaptively selects among pruning, pooling, convolution, and resampler
primitives to balance FLOPs/parameters and accuracy per input. To avoid costly
offline distillation corpora, we propose an online-logit distillation protocol
that trains the draft model with on-the-fly teacher logits and penultimate
features using a combined cross-entropy and Smooth L1 objective, eliminating
storage and preprocessing while remaining compute-efficient. This protocol
reveals a training-time scaling effect: longer online training monotonically
increases the draft model's average accepted length, improving speculative
efficiency. Empirically, SpecVLM achieves additional acceleration, culminating
in 2.5--2.9x end-to-end speedups within 5 epochs across LLaVA and MMMU,
consistently over resolutions and task difficulties, while preserving the
target model's output distribution (lossless decoding). Our code is available

Conclusion: MAFS框架有效实现了图像融合和语义分割任务的统一处理，通过任务间的相互促进提升了整体性能

Abstract: Infrared-visible image fusion methods aim at generating fused images with
good visual quality and also facilitate the performance of high-level tasks.
Indeed, existing semantic-driven methods have considered semantic information
injection for downstream applications. However, none of them investigates the
potential for reciprocal promotion between pixel-wise image fusion and
cross-modal feature fusion perception tasks from a macroscopic task-level
perspective. To address this limitation, we propose a unified network for image
fusion and semantic segmentation. MAFS is a parallel structure, containing a
fusion sub-network and a segmentation sub-network. On the one hand, We devise a
heterogeneous feature fusion strategy to enhance semantic-aware capabilities
for image fusion. On the other hand, by cascading the fusion sub-network and a
segmentation backbone, segmentation-related knowledge is transferred to promote
feature-level fusion-based segmentation. Within the framework, we design a
novel multi-stage Transformer decoder to aggregate fine-grained multi-scale
fused features efficiently. Additionally, a dynamic factor based on the max-min
fairness allocation principle is introduced to generate adaptive weights of two
tasks and guarantee smooth training in a multi-task manner. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves competitive results compared
with state-of-the-art methods. The code is available at

Motivation: 现有概率验证方法难以扩展到现代分割任务的复杂性和高维度，通常产生过于保守而不实用的保证，需要一种既能提供可证明保证又避免过度保守的架构无关且可扩展的验证框架。

Method: 结合采样可达性分析和保形推理(CI)，提出新颖策略来减少高维设置中的保守性，同时保持严谨性。

Conclusion: 该框架为语义分割网络提供了既可靠又实用的概率安全验证解决方案，并提供了开源工具箱实现。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation networks (SSNs) play a critical role in domains such as
medical imaging, autonomous driving, and environmental monitoring, where safety
hinges on reliable model behavior under uncertainty. Yet, existing
probabilistic verification approaches struggle to scale with the complexity and
dimensionality of modern segmentation tasks, often yielding guarantees that are
too conservative to be practical. We introduce a probabilistic verification
framework that is both architecture-agnostic and scalable to high-dimensional
outputs. Our approach combines sampling-based reachability analysis with
conformal inference (CI) to deliver provable guarantees while avoiding the
excessive conservatism of prior methods. To counteract CI's limitations in
high-dimensional settings, we propose novel strategies that reduce conservatism
without compromising rigor. Empirical evaluation on large-scale segmentation
models across CamVid, OCTA-500, Lung Segmentation, and Cityscapes demonstrates
that our method provides reliable safety guarantees while substantially
tightening bounds compared to SOTA. We also provide a toolbox implementing this
technique, available on Github.

Conclusion: 使用生成式VLMs产生的合成描述是实现视觉-语言密集对齐的有效方法，具有成本低、可扩展性强的优势

Abstract: Generative vision-language models (VLMs) exhibit strong high-level image
understanding but lack spatially dense alignment between vision and language
modalities, as our findings indicate. Orthogonal to advancements in generative
VLMs, another line of research has focused on representation learning for
vision-language alignment, targeting zero-shot inference for dense tasks like
segmentation. In this work, we bridge these two directions by densely aligning
images with synthetic descriptions generated by VLMs. Synthetic captions are
inexpensive, scalable, and easy to generate, making them an excellent source of
high-level semantic understanding for dense alignment methods. Empirically, our
approach outperforms prior work on standard zero-shot open-vocabulary
segmentation benchmarks/datasets, while also being more data-efficient.

Conclusion: SDI-GS提升了3D高斯泼溅在受限视图场景中的实用性，通过高效初始化方法解决了内存和效率问题

Abstract: Sparse-view synthesis remains a challenging problem due to the difficulty of
recovering accurate geometry and appearance from limited observations. While
recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have enabled real-time
rendering with competitive quality, existing pipelines often rely on
Structure-from-Motion (SfM) for camera pose estimation, an approach that
struggles in genuinely sparse-view settings. Moreover, several SfM-free methods
replace SfM with multi-view stereo (MVS) models, but generate massive numbers
of 3D Gaussians by back-projecting every pixel into 3D space, leading to high
memory costs. We propose Segmentation-Driven Initialization for Gaussian
Splatting (SDI-GS), a method that mitigates inefficiency by leveraging
region-based segmentation to identify and retain only structurally significant
regions. This enables selective downsampling of the dense point cloud,
preserving scene fidelity while substantially reducing Gaussian count.
Experiments across diverse benchmarks show that SDI-GS reduces Gaussian count
by up to 50% and achieves comparable or superior rendering quality in PSNR and
SSIM, with only marginal degradation in LPIPS. It further enables faster
training and lower memory footprint, advancing the practicality of 3DGS for

*Haodi Ma,Vyom Pathak,Daisy Zhe Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SG-VLM通过地景图符号基础提升视频问答的时间和因果推理能力，在多个标准测试集上超过基线模型


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有视觉语言模型在视频问答中依赖浅层相关性、时间基准弱和可解释性局限的问题

Method: 提出SG-VLM框架，通过提示和视觉定位技术，将冻结的VLM与符号地景图表征相结合

Result: 在NExT-QA、iVQA、ActivityNet-QA等三个测试集上，SG-VLM在因果和时间推理方面表现更优，超过了之前的基线模型

Conclusion: 符号基础方法在视频理解中具有潜力，但目前收益有限，为未来混合VLM-符号方法提供了指导

Abstract: Video Question Answering (VQA) requires models to reason over spatial,
temporal, and causal cues in videos. Recent vision language models (VLMs)
achieve strong results but often rely on shallow correlations, leading to weak
temporal grounding and limited interpretability. We study symbolic scene graphs
(SGs) as intermediate grounding signals for VQA. SGs provide structured
object-relation representations that complement VLMs holistic reasoning. We
introduce SG-VLM, a modular framework that integrates frozen VLMs with scene
graph grounding via prompting and visual localization. Across three benchmarks
(NExT-QA, iVQA, ActivityNet-QA) and multiple VLMs (QwenVL, InternVL), SG-VLM
improves causal and temporal reasoning and outperforms prior baselines, though
gains over strong VLMs are limited. These findings highlight both the promise
and current limitations of symbolic grounding, and offer guidance for future
hybrid VLM-symbolic approaches in video understanding.

Motivation: 大型视频模型存在严重的幻觉问题，产生与输入视频冲突的内容，需要有效的识别和评估方法

Method: 构建Dr.V分层框架，包括Dr.V-Bench标准数据集（从4,974个视频中提取10k示例）和Dr.V-Agent卫星视频代理，通过细粒度空间-时间基准进行感知、时间和认知级别的逐步检测

Result: 大规模实验证明Dr.V-Agent能够有效诊断幻觉现象，同时提高了可解释性和可靠性

Conclusion: Dr.V为实际场景中的健壮视频理解提供了实用的蓝图，具有良好的应用前景

Abstract: Recent advancements in large video models (LVMs) have significantly enhance
video understanding. However, these models continue to suffer from
hallucinations, producing content that conflicts with input videos. To address
this issue, we propose Dr.V, a hierarchical framework covering perceptive,
temporal, and cognitive levels to diagnose video hallucination by fine-grained
spatial-temporal grounding. Dr.V comprises of two key components: a benchmark
dataset Dr.V-Bench and a satellite video agent Dr.V-Agent. Dr.V-Bench includes
10k instances drawn from 4,974 videos spanning diverse tasks, each enriched
with detailed spatial-temporal annotation. Dr.V-Agent detects hallucinations in
LVMs by systematically applying fine-grained spatial-temporal grounding at the
perceptive and temporal levels, followed by cognitive level reasoning. This
step-by-step pipeline mirrors human-like video comprehension and effectively
identifies hallucinations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Dr.V-Agent is
effective in diagnosing hallucination while enhancing interpretability and
reliability, offering a practical blueprint for robust video understanding in
real-world scenarios. All our data and code are available at

TL;DR: MOT方法在猪只长期追踪中优于传统MAT工具，能够提高畜牧业自动化追踪的准确性和可靠性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 精准畜牧业需要先进的监测工具，现有MAT工具性能不如最先进的MOT方法，导致下游任务不准确

Method: 对DeepLabCut、idTracker等MAT工具和ByteTrack、DeepSORT等MOT方法在10分钟猪只追踪数据集上进行基准测试

Result: 总体上MOT方法优于传统MAT工具，即使在长期追踪场景下也是如此

Conclusion: 最新的MOT技术有潜力提高自动化牲畜追踪的准确性和可靠性

Abstract: Precision livestock farming requires advanced monitoring tools to meet the
increasing management needs of the industry. Computer vision systems capable of
long-term multi-animal tracking (MAT) are essential for continuous behavioral
monitoring in livestock production. MAT, a specialized subset of multi-object
tracking (MOT), shares many challenges with MOT, but also faces domain-specific
issues including frequent animal occlusion, highly similar appearances among
animals, erratic motion patterns, and a wide range of behavior types.
  While some existing MAT tools are user-friendly and widely adopted, they
often underperform compared to state-of-the-art MOT methods, which can result
in inaccurate downstream tasks such as behavior analysis, health state
estimation, and related applications. In this study, we benchmarked both MAT
and MOT approaches for long-term tracking of pigs. We compared tools such as
DeepLabCut and idTracker with MOT-based methods including ByteTrack, DeepSORT,
cross-input consistency, and newer approaches like Track-Anything and
PromptTrack.
  All methods were evaluated on a 10-minute pig tracking dataset. Our results
demonstrate that, overall, MOT approaches outperform traditional MAT tools,
even for long-term tracking scenarios. These findings highlight the potential
of recent MOT techniques to enhance the accuracy and reliability of automated
livestock tracking.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 诗歌作为表达性艺术形式具有多重解读性，读者常基于自身情感、经验和文化背景理解诗歌。需要一种能够让观众根据需求修改生成图像的方法。

Method: 引入新颖的WPM技术，系统性地修改扩散模型中的注意力权重和文本嵌入，动态调整特定词汇的重要性，增强或抑制其在最终生成图像中的影响。结合扩散模型、大型语言模型（如GPT）和现有诗歌数据集。

Result: 实现了语义更丰富、上下文更准确的诗歌图像生成，为零样本设置下的图像修改提供了有效方法。

Conclusion: 这是首次将加权提示操作技术集成到诗歌语言图像增强中的尝试，为文学领域的图像生成提供了全面结构化的方法论。

Abstract: Poetry is an expressive form of art that invites multiple interpretations, as
readers often bring their own emotions, experiences, and cultural backgrounds
into their understanding of a poem. Recognizing this, we aim to generate images
for poems and improve these images in a zero-shot setting, enabling audiences
to modify images as per their requirements. To achieve this, we introduce a
novel Weighted Prompt Manipulation (WPM) technique, which systematically
modifies attention weights and text embeddings within diffusion models. By
dynamically adjusting the importance of specific words, WPM enhances or
suppresses their influence in the final generated image, leading to
semantically richer and more contextually accurate visualizations. Our approach
exploits diffusion models and large language models (LLMs) such as GPT in
conjunction with existing poetry datasets, ensuring a comprehensive and
structured methodology for improved image generation in the literary domain. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt at integrating weighted
prompt manipulation for enhancing imagery in poetic language.

TL;DR: SAM-TTT通过反向参数配置和测试时训练增强SAM在伪装目标检测中的性能，抑制不利参数同时强化有利参数，在多个基准测试中达到最先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于SAM的COD模型主要关注提取有利特征和增强有利参数，但忽视了不利参数对SAM语义理解的负面影响，需要解决这一关键问题。

Method: 提出反向SAM参数配置模块以训练无关方式抑制不利参数，并引入T-Visioner模块将测试时训练层集成到视觉任务中强化有利参数。

Result: 在多个COD基准测试中实现了最先进的性能，显著提升了SAM在COD任务中的语义理解能力。

Conclusion: SAM-TTT通过同时抑制不利参数和强化有利参数，有效提升了SAM在伪装目标检测任务中的表现，为该领域设立了新的基准。

Abstract: This paper introduces a new Segment Anything Model (SAM) that leverages
reverse parameter configuration and test-time training to enhance its
performance on Camouflaged Object Detection (COD), named SAM-TTT. While most
existing SAM-based COD models primarily focus on enhancing SAM by extracting
favorable features and amplifying its advantageous parameters, a crucial gap is
identified: insufficient attention to adverse parameters that impair SAM's
semantic understanding in downstream tasks. To tackle this issue, the Reverse
SAM Parameter Configuration Module is proposed to effectively mitigate the
influence of adverse parameters in a train-free manner by configuring SAM's
parameters. Building on this foundation, the T-Visioner Module is unveiled to
strengthen advantageous parameters by integrating Test-Time Training layers,
originally developed for language tasks, into vision tasks. Test-Time Training
layers represent a new class of sequence modeling layers characterized by
linear complexity and an expressive hidden state. By integrating two modules,
SAM-TTT simultaneously suppresses adverse parameters while reinforcing
advantageous ones, significantly improving SAM's semantic understanding in COD
task. Our experimental results on various COD benchmarks demonstrate that the
proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, setting a new
benchmark in the field. The code will be available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Brea-Depth是一个用于支气管镜深度估计的新框架，通过整合气道特异性几何先验来改进基础模型，解决了现有方法缺乏解剖意识的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 支气管镜中的单目深度估计可以提高实时导航精度和手术安全性，但现有深度基础模型在支气管镜场景中缺乏解剖意识，过度拟合局部纹理而非捕捉全局气道结构，特别是在深度线索模糊和光照条件差的情况下。

Method: 提出Brea-Depth框架，包含深度感知CycleGAN来弥合真实支气管镜图像与解剖数据中气道几何之间的域差距，并引入气道结构意识损失来强制气道腔内深度一致性，同时保持平滑过渡和结构完整性。

Result: 在收集的离体人肺数据集和开放支气管镜数据集上验证，Brea-Depth在解剖深度保持方面优于现有方法，并引入了新的气道深度结构评估指标来评估解剖真实性。

Conclusion: 通过整合解剖先验，Brea-Depth增强了模型的泛化能力，产生了更鲁棒、准确的3D气道重建，为支气管镜深度估计提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation in bronchoscopy can significantly improve
real-time navigation accuracy and enhance the safety of interventions in
complex, branching airways. Recent advances in depth foundation models have
shown promise for endoscopic scenarios, yet these models often lack anatomical
awareness in bronchoscopy, overfitting to local textures rather than capturing
the global airway structure, particularly under ambiguous depth cues and poor
lighting. To address this, we propose Brea-Depth, a novel framework that
integrates airway-specific geometric priors into foundation model adaptation
for bronchoscopic depth estimation. Our method introduces a depth-aware
CycleGAN, refining the translation between real bronchoscopic images and airway
geometries from anatomical data, effectively bridging the domain gap. In
addition, we introduce an airway structure awareness loss to enforce depth
consistency within the airway lumen while preserving smooth transitions and
structural integrity. By incorporating anatomical priors, Brea-Depth enhances
model generalization and yields more robust, accurate 3D airway
reconstructions. To assess anatomical realism, we introduce Airway Depth
Structure Evaluation, a new metric for structural consistency. We validate
BREA-Depth on a collected ex vivo human lung dataset and an open bronchoscopic
dataset, where it outperforms existing methods in anatomical depth
preservation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出在logit空间进行线性插值的方法，通过混合内分布和外分布数据来平滑logits，改善外分布检测性能，特别是对于靠近内分布的外分布数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如Outlier Exposure和Mixture Outlier Exposure虽然能提升外分布检测性能，但模型仍难以有效学习类别间关系并清晰区分内分布和外分布数据。

Method: 在logit空间进行线性插值混合内分布和外分布数据，同时强制logit空间混合与输入空间混合的一致性约束。

Result: 实验表明该方法减少了模型输出在决策边界附近的突变，实现了更平滑可靠的内外分布分离，在细粒度外分布检测任务中表现有效。

Conclusion: logit空间混合技术能有效提升外分布检测性能，特别是对靠近内分布的异常数据具有更好的区分能力。

Abstract: The ability to detect out-of-distribution data is essential not only for
ensuring robustness against unknown or unexpected input data but also for
improving the generalization performance of the model. Among various
out-of-distribution detection methods, Outlier Exposure and Mixture Outlier
Exposure are promising approaches that enhance out-of-distribution detection
performance by exposing the outlier data during training. However, even with
these sophisticated techniques, it remains challenging for models to learn the
relationships between classes effectively and to distinguish data sampling from
in-distribution and out-of-distribution clearly. Therefore, we focus on the
logit space, where the properties between class-wise distributions are
distinctly separated from those in the input or feature spaces. Specifically,
we propose a linear interpolation technique in the logit space that mixes
in-distribution and out-of-distribution data to facilitate smoothing logits
between classes and improve the out-of-distribution detection performance,
particularly for out-of-distribution data that lie close to the in-distribution
data. Additionally, we enforce consistency between the logits obtained through
mixing in the logit space and those generated via mixing in the input space.
Our experiments demonstrate that our logit-space mixing technique reduces the
abrupt fluctuations in the model outputs near the decision boundaries,
resulting in smoother and more reliable separation between in-distribution and
out-of-distribution data. Furthermore, we evaluate the effectiveness of the
proposed method on a fine-grained out-of-distribution detection task.

Conclusion: 该方法为增量式3D语义场景图预测提供了一种灵活且高效的方案，通过多模态信息集成提升了模型在真实环境中的表现和适用性

Abstract: 3D semantic scene graphs (3DSSG) provide compact structured representations
of environments by explicitly modeling objects, attributes, and relationships.
While 3DSSGs have shown promise in robotics and embodied AI, many existing
methods rely mainly on sensor data, not integrating further information from
semantically rich environments. Additionally, most methods assume access to
complete scene reconstructions, limiting their applicability in real-world,
incremental settings. This paper introduces a novel heterogeneous graph model
for incremental 3DSSG prediction that integrates additional, multi-modal
information, such as prior observations, directly into the message-passing
process. Utilizing multiple layers, the model flexibly incorporates global and
local scene representations without requiring specialized modules or full scene
reconstructions. We evaluate our approach on the 3DSSG dataset, showing that
GNNs enriched with multi-modal information such as semantic embeddings (e.g.,
CLIP) and prior observations offer a scalable and generalizable solution for
complex, real-world environments. The full source code of the presented
architecture will be made available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于像素的面部表情识别模型因面部外观是情感的间接且有偏代理，难以跨数据集泛化。需要利用脑电信号提供的更直接情感信息来提升模型鲁棒性。

Method: 使用EEG地形图训练的教师模型生成5x5 V/A原型网格，学生模型（ResNet）通过Proto-KD对齐特征到静态原型，D-Geo正则化器根据抑郁研究调整嵌入几何结构。

Result: 方法在FERPlus验证集和跨数据集（AffectNet-mini、CK+）评估中均显示一致性能提升，原型和D-Geo均贡献显著增益，5x5网格比更密网格更稳定。

Conclusion: 该框架简单可部署，无需额外架构复杂性即可提高鲁棒性，通过脑信息先验知识有效提升了面部表情识别的跨数据集泛化能力。

Abstract: Facial emotion recognition (FER) models trained only on pixels often fail to
generalize across datasets because facial appearance is an indirect and biased
proxy for underlying affect. We present NeuroGaze-Distill, a cross-modal
distillation framework that transfers brain-informed priors into an image-only
FER student via static Valence/Arousal (V/A) prototypes and a
depression-inspired geometric prior (D-Geo). A teacher trained on EEG
topographic maps from DREAMER (with MAHNOB-HCI as unlabeled support) produces a
consolidated 5x5 V/A prototype grid that is frozen and reused; no EEG-face
pairing and no non-visual signals at deployment are required. The student
(ResNet-18/50) is trained on FERPlus with conventional CE/KD and two
lightweight regularizers: (i) Proto-KD (cosine) aligns student features to the
static prototypes; (ii) D-Geo softly shapes the embedding geometry in line with
affective findings often reported in depression research (e.g., anhedonia-like
contraction in high-valence regions). We evaluate both within-domain (FERPlus
validation) and cross-dataset protocols (AffectNet-mini; optional CK+),
reporting standard 8-way scores alongside present-only Macro-F1 and balanced
accuracy to fairly handle label-set mismatch. Ablations attribute consistent
gains to prototypes and D-Geo, and favor 5x5 over denser grids for stability.
The method is simple, deployable, and improves robustness without architectural
complexity.

Result: 在内部收集的数据集上进行了深入实验，验证了VMD策略的有效性

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效利用放射科医生的领域知识，提高对未标注3D MRI图像的诊断网络准确性

Abstract: Multimodal learning has attracted much attention in recent years due to its
ability to effectively utilize data features from a variety of different
modalities. Diagnosing the vulnerability of atherosclerotic plaques directly
from carotid 3D MRI images is relatively challenging for both radiologists and
conventional 3D vision networks. In clinical practice, radiologists assess
patient conditions using a multimodal approach that incorporates various
imaging modalities and domain-specific expertise, paving the way for the
creation of multimodal diagnostic networks. In this paper, we have developed an
effective strategy to leverage radiologists' domain knowledge to automate the
diagnosis of carotid plaque vulnerability through Variation inference and
Multimodal knowledge Distillation (VMD). This method excels in harnessing
cross-modality prior knowledge from limited image annotations and radiology
reports within training data, thereby enhancing the diagnostic network's
accuracy for unannotated 3D MRI images. We conducted in-depth experiments on
the dataset collected in-house and verified the effectiveness of the VMD
strategy we proposed.

Conclusion: 该方法通过结合图滤波理论和深度学习方法，提供了一种参数效率高且性能优越的图像插值解决方案。

Abstract: Conventional deep neural nets (DNNs) initialize network parameters at random
and then optimize each one via stochastic gradient descent (SGD), resulting in
substantial risk of poor-performing local minima.Focusing on the image
interpolation problem and leveraging a recent theorem that maps a
(pseudo-)linear interpolator {\Theta} to a directed graph filter that is a
solution to a MAP problem regularized with a graph shift variation (GSV) prior,
we first initialize a directed graph adjacency matrix A based on a known
interpolator {\Theta}, establishing a baseline performance.Then, towards
further gain, we learn perturbation matrices P and P(2) from data to augment A,
whose restoration effects are implemented via Douglas-Rachford (DR) iterations,
which we unroll into a lightweight interpretable neural net.Experimental
results demonstrate state-of-the-art image interpolation results, while
drastically reducing network parameters.

Abstract: The recent success of immersive applications is pushing the research
community to define new approaches to process 360{\deg} images and videos and
optimize their transmission. Among these, saliency estimation provides a
powerful tool that can be used to identify visually relevant areas and,
consequently, adapt processing algorithms. Although saliency estimation has
been widely investigated for 2D content, very few algorithms have been proposed
for 360{\deg} saliency estimation. Towards this goal, we introduce Sphere-GAN,
a saliency detection model for 360{\deg} videos that leverages a Generative
Adversarial Network with spherical convolutions. Extensive experiments were
conducted using a public 360{\deg} video saliency dataset, and the results
demonstrate that Sphere-GAN outperforms state-of-the-art models in accurately
predicting saliency maps.

Conclusion: 方法在多个数据集上表现竞争力，具有良好的普遍性和稳健性，通过可解释性推理提高了模型透明度

Abstract: Accurate land cover classification from satellite imagery is crucial in
environmental monitoring and sustainable resource management. However, it
remains challenging due to the complexity of natural landscapes, the visual
similarity between classes, and the significant class imbalance in the
available datasets. To address these issues, we propose a dual encoder
architecture that independently extracts modality-specific features from
optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery, which are then fused using
a cross-modality attention-fusion module named Cross-modality Land cover
segmentation with Attention and Imbalance-aware Reasoning-Enhanced Explanations
(CLAIRE). This fusion mechanism highlights complementary spatial and textural
features, enabling the network to better capture detailed and diverse land
cover patterns. We incorporate a hybrid loss function that utilizes Weighted
Focal Loss and Tversky Loss named RIFT (Rare-Instance Focal-Tversky) to address
class imbalance and improve segmentation performance across underrepresented
categories. Our model achieves competitive performance across multiple
benchmarks: a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 56.02% and Overall
Accuracy (OA) of 84.56% on the WHU-OPT-SAR dataset; strong generalization with
a mIoU of 59.89% and OA of 73.92% on the OpenEarthMap-SAR dataset; and
remarkable robustness under cloud-obstructed conditions, achieving an mIoU of
86.86% and OA of 94.58% on the PIE-RGB-SAR dataset. Additionally, we introduce
a metric-driven reasoning module generated by a Small Language Model (Phi-3),
which generates expert-level, sample-specific justifications for model
predictions, thereby enhancing transparency and interpretability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文研究了视觉语言模型中连接器组件导致的信息损失问题，通过分析潜在表示空间来量化和可视化这种损失，发现连接器会显著扭曲视觉表示的局部几何结构，导致检索性能下降，并可以预测模型在视觉问答任务中的困难实例。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型通过连接器将视觉特征投影到语言模型嵌入空间，但这种投影步骤可能导致信息损失，且这种损失对模型能力的影响尚未得到充分研究。

Method: 提出了两种互补方法：1）通过分析投影前后图像表示的k近邻关系变化来评估语义信息保存；2）通过从投影表示重建视觉嵌入来直接测量信息损失，并在图像块级别定位损失。

Result: 实验显示连接器显著扭曲视觉表示的局部几何结构，k近邻在投影后偏离40-60%，与检索性能下降相关。补丁级嵌入重建为视觉问答任务提供了可解释的见解，发现高信息损失区域可靠地预测模型困难的实例。

Conclusion: 连接器组件在视觉语言模型中引起显著的信息损失，这种损失会影响模型性能，通过分析潜在表示空间可以量化和可视化这种损失，为模型改进提供指导。

Abstract: Vision--language models (VLMs) often process visual inputs through a
pretrained vision encoder, followed by a projection into the language model's
embedding space via a connector component. While crucial for modality fusion,
the potential information loss induced by this projection step and its direct
impact on model capabilities remain understudied. We introduce two
complementary approaches to examine and quantify this loss by analyzing the
latent representation space. First, we evaluate semantic information
preservation by analyzing changes in k-nearest neighbor relationships between
image representations, before and after projection. Second, we directly measure
information loss by reconstructing visual embeddings from the projected
representation, localizing loss at an image patch level. Experiments reveal
that connectors substantially distort the local geometry of visual

TL;DR: SCORE是一个用于扩散模型概念擦除的新框架，通过对抗性独立方法实现敏感概念的安全去除，在多个基准测试中表现优于现有方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在图像生成方面取得了巨大成功，但在隐私、公平性和安全性方面存在风险，需要一种能够有效擦除敏感或有害概念的方法

Method: SCORE将概念擦除建模为对抗性独立问题，通过最小化目标概念与生成输出之间的互信息，结合对抗优化、轨迹一致性和显著性驱动的微调

Result: 在Stable Diffusion和FLUX上的四个基准测试中，SCORE比现有方法（EraseAnything、ANT、MACE、ESD、UCE）擦除效果提升高达12.5%，同时保持相当的图像质量

Conclusion: SCORE为扩散模型中的安全和鲁棒概念擦除设定了新标准，提供了可证明的擦除保证和理论收敛性

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved unprecedented success in image generation but
pose increasing risks in terms of privacy, fairness, and security. A growing
demand exists to \emph{erase} sensitive or harmful concepts (e.g., NSFW
content, private individuals, artistic styles) from these models while
preserving their overall generative capabilities. We introduce \textbf{SCORE}
(Secure and Concept-Oriented Robust Erasure), a novel framework for robust
concept removal in diffusion models. SCORE formulates concept erasure as an
\emph{adversarial independence} problem, theoretically guaranteeing that the
model's outputs become statistically independent of the erased concept. Unlike
prior heuristic methods, SCORE minimizes the mutual information between a
target concept and generated outputs, yielding provable erasure guarantees. We
provide formal proofs establishing convergence properties and derive upper
bounds on residual concept leakage. Empirically, we evaluate SCORE on Stable
Diffusion and FLUX across four challenging benchmarks: object erasure, NSFW
removal, celebrity face suppression, and artistic style unlearning. SCORE
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods including EraseAnything, ANT,
MACE, ESD, and UCE, achieving up to \textbf{12.5\%} higher erasure efficacy
while maintaining comparable or superior image quality. By integrating
adversarial optimization, trajectory consistency, and saliency-driven
fine-tuning, SCORE sets a new standard for secure and robust concept erasure in
diffusion models.

Motivation: 解决现有退化导向方法在极端场景下的局限性，以及跨任务性能不平衡、对已知退化过拟合和对未知退化泛化能力弱等常见挑战。

Method: 采用两阶段框架：1) AdaSAM预训练策略，在语义丰富和纹理区域应用像素级掩码；2) MAC选择性微调策略，调整贡献较大的层；3) RFR策略，利用DINOv2的语义一致性和退化不变表示进行特征融合。

Conclusion: RAM++通过集成高级语义理解和低级纹理生成，实现了内容导向的鲁棒图像修复，有效解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: This work presents Robust Representation Learning via Adaptive Mask (RAM++),
a two-stage framework for all-in-one image restoration. RAM++ integrates
high-level semantic understanding with low-level texture generation to achieve
content-oriented robust restoration. It addresses the limitations of existing
degradation-oriented methods in extreme scenarios (e.g., degradations strongly
coupled with image structures). RAM++ also mitigates common challenges such as
unbalanced performance across tasks, overfitting to seen degradations, and weak
generalization to unseen ones through three key designs: 1) Adaptive
Semantic-Aware Mask (AdaSAM): a pretraining strategy that applies pixel-level
masks to semantically rich and textured regions. This design enables the
network to learn both generative priors and image content priors from various
degradations. 2) Mask Attribute Conductance (MAC): a selective fine-tuning
strategy that adjusts the layers with higher contributions to bridge the
integrity gap between masked pretraining and full-image fine-tuning while
retaining learned priors. 3) Robust Feature Regularization (RFR): a strategy
that leverages DINOv2's semantically consistent and degradation-invariant
representations, together with efficient feature fusion, to achieve faithful
and semantically coherent restoration. With these designs, RAM++ achieves
robust, well-balanced, and state-of-the-art performance across seen, unseen,
extreme, and mixed degradations. Our code and model will be released at

Motivation: 遥感图像开放词汇分割(OVRSIS)任务缺乏统一评测基准，且自然图像与遥感图像存在领域间隔，导致现有方法直接应用效果不佳。

Method: 提出RSKT-Seg框架，包含三个核心模块：(1)多方向成本地图聚合(RS-CMA)模块获取旋转不变特征；(2)高效成本地图融合(RS-Fusion)变换器；(3)遥感知识转移(RS-Transfer)模块注入领域知识。

Conclusion: 该研究为遥感图像开放词汇分割领域提供了统一的评测标准和高效的解决方案，RSKT-Seg框架通过领域适配技术显著提升了性能和速度。

Abstract: Open-Vocabulary Remote Sensing Image Segmentation (OVRSIS), an emerging task
that adapts Open-Vocabulary Segmentation (OVS) to the remote sensing (RS)
domain, remains underexplored due to the absence of a unified evaluation
benchmark and the domain gap between natural and RS images. To bridge these
gaps, we first establish a standardized OVRSIS benchmark (\textbf{OVRSISBench})
based on widely-used RS segmentation datasets, enabling consistent evaluation
across methods. Using this benchmark, we comprehensively evaluate several
representative OVS/OVRSIS models and reveal their limitations when directly
applied to remote sensing scenarios. Building on these insights, we propose
\textbf{RSKT-Seg}, a novel open-vocabulary segmentation framework tailored for
remote sensing. RSKT-Seg integrates three key components: (1) a
Multi-Directional Cost Map Aggregation (RS-CMA) module that captures
rotation-invariant visual cues by computing vision-language cosine similarities
across multiple directions; (2) an Efficient Cost Map Fusion (RS-Fusion)
transformer, which jointly models spatial and semantic dependencies with a
lightweight dimensionality reduction strategy; and (3) a Remote Sensing
Knowledge Transfer (RS-Transfer) module that injects pre-trained knowledge and
facilitates domain adaptation via enhanced upsampling. Extensive experiments on
the benchmark show that RSKT-Seg consistently outperforms strong OVS baselines
by +3.8 mIoU and +5.9 mACC, while achieving 2x faster inference through
efficient aggregation. Our code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归模型在图像生成方面表现出色，但在布局条件生成方面面临挑战，主要问题是布局条件的稀疏性和特征纠缠风险，需要开发能够有效整合空间布局约束的方法。

Method: 提出结构化掩码策略来控制全局提示、布局和图像标记之间的交互，防止不同区域与其描述之间的错误关联；同时采用基于组相对策略优化(GRPO)的后训练方案，使用专门设计的布局奖励函数来提升生成质量和布局准确性。

Result: 实验结果表明SMARLI能够无缝整合布局标记与文本和图像标记，在不影响生成质量的前提下实现卓越的布局感知控制，同时保持了自回归模型的结构简单性和生成效率。

Conclusion: SMARLI框架成功解决了布局条件图像生成的挑战，通过创新的结构化掩码和强化学习后训练方法，为自回归模型提供了有效的布局控制能力，在保持模型简洁性的同时实现了高质量的布局条件图像生成。

Abstract: While autoregressive (AR) models have demonstrated remarkable success in
image generation, extending them to layout-conditioned generation remains
challenging due to the sparse nature of layout conditions and the risk of
feature entanglement. We present Structured Masking for AR-based
Layout-to-Image (SMARLI), a novel framework for layoutto-image generation that
effectively integrates spatial layout constraints into AR-based image
generation. To equip AR model with layout control, a specially designed
structured masking strategy is applied to attention computation to govern the
interaction among the global prompt, layout, and image tokens. This design
prevents mis-association between different regions and their descriptions while
enabling sufficient injection of layout constraints into the generation
process. To further enhance generation quality and layout accuracy, we
incorporate Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) based post-training
scheme with specially designed layout reward functions for next-set-based AR
models. Experimental results demonstrate that SMARLI is able to seamlessly
integrate layout tokens with text and image tokens without compromising
generation quality. It achieves superior layoutaware control while maintaining
the structural simplicity and generation efficiency of AR models.

Abstract: Animal behavior analysis plays a crucial role in understanding animal
welfare, health status, and productivity in agricultural settings. However,
traditional manual observation methods are time-consuming, subjective, and
limited in scalability. We present a modular pipeline that leverages
open-sourced state-of-the-art computer vision techniques to automate animal
behavior analysis in a group housing environment. Our approach combines
state-of-the-art models for zero-shot object detection, motion-aware tracking
and segmentation, and advanced feature extraction using vision transformers for
robust behavior recognition. The pipeline addresses challenges including animal
occlusions and group housing scenarios as demonstrated in indoor pig
monitoring. We validated our system on the Edinburgh Pig Behavior Video Dataset
for multiple behavioral tasks. Our temporal model achieved 94.2% overall
accuracy, representing a 21.2 percentage point improvement over existing
methods. The pipeline demonstrated robust tracking capabilities with 93.3%
identity preservation score and 89.3% object detection precision. The modular
design suggests potential for adaptation to other contexts, though further
validation across species would be required. The open-source implementation
provides a scalable solution for behavior monitoring, contributing to precision
pig farming and welfare assessment through automated, objective, and continuous

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于GAN或扩散模型的说话头部动画方法存在帧间闪烁、身份漂移和推理速度慢的问题，限制了实际应用。需要开发一种能够生成高质量、时序一致且高效的说话头部动画解决方案。

Method: 采用两阶段生成策略：1）面部关键帧生成阶段，通过音素-视觉映射和文本-帧因果注意力掩码生成语义关键帧；2）帧间插值阶段，使用时序感知自适应策略和选择性状态空间模型实现双向上下文推理，确保时序连贯性。

Conclusion: AvatarSync通过创新的两阶段生成框架和时序感知自适应策略，成功解决了说话头部动画中的关键挑战，为实际应用提供了高效可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Existing talking-head animation approaches based on Generative Adversarial
Networks (GANs) or diffusion models often suffer from inter-frame flicker,
identity drift, and slow inference. These limitations inherent to their video
generation pipelines restrict their suitability for applications. To address
this, we introduce AvatarSync, an autoregressive framework on phoneme
representations that generates realistic and controllable talking-head
animations from a single reference image, driven directly text or audio input.
In addition, AvatarSync adopts a two-stage generation strategy, decoupling
semantic modeling from visual dynamics, which is a deliberate "Divide and
Conquer" design. The first stage, Facial Keyframe Generation (FKG), focuses on
phoneme-level semantic representation by leveraging the many-to-one mapping
from text or audio to phonemes. A Phoneme-to-Visual Mapping is constructed to
anchor abstract phonemes to character-level units. Combined with a customized
Text-Frame Causal Attention Mask, the keyframes are generated. The second
stage, inter-frame interpolation, emphasizes temporal coherence and visual
smoothness. We introduce a timestamp-aware adaptive strategy based on a
selective state space model, enabling efficient bidirectional context
reasoning. To support deployment, we optimize the inference pipeline to reduce
latency without compromising visual fidelity. Extensive experiments show that
AvatarSync outperforms existing talking-head animation methods in visual
fidelity, temporal consistency, and computational efficiency, providing a
scalable and controllable solution.

Method: 设计了胎儿特定的数据增帽策略，模拟早期孕役的特有子宫环境和胎儿位置，仅使用过期孕役的标注数据就能让模型适应早期孕役。

Abstract: Fetal motion is a critical indicator of neurological development and
intrauterine health, yet its quantification remains challenging, particularly
at earlier gestational ages (GA). Current methods track fetal motion by
predicting the location of annotated landmarks on 3D echo planar imaging (EPI)
time-series, primarily in third-trimester fetuses. The predicted landmarks
enable simplification of the fetal body for downstream analysis. While these
methods perform well within their training age distribution, they consistently
fail to generalize to early GAs due to significant anatomical changes in both
mother and fetus across gestation, as well as the difficulty of obtaining
annotated early GA EPI data. In this work, we develop a cross-population data
augmentation framework that enables pose estimation models to robustly
generalize to younger GA clinical cohorts using only annotated images from
older GA cohorts. Specifically, we introduce a fetal-specific augmentation
strategy that simulates the distinct intrauterine environment and fetal
positioning of early GAs. Our experiments find that cross-population
augmentation yields reduced variability and significant improvements across
both older GA and challenging early GA cases. By enabling more reliable pose
estimation across gestation, our work potentially facilitates early clinical
detection and intervention in challenging 4D fetal imaging settings. Code is

Conclusion: ImplMORe通过隐式表示成功解决了医学图像器官重建中的分辨率限制问题，为精细表面重建提供了有效的端到端解决方案。

Abstract: The fine-grained surface reconstruction of different organs from 3D medical
imaging can provide advanced diagnostic support and improved surgical planning.
However, the representation of the organs is often limited by the resolution,
with a detailed higher resolution requiring more memory and computing
footprint. Implicit representations of objects have been proposed to alleviate
this problem in general computer vision by providing compact and differentiable
functions to represent the 3D object shapes. However, architectural and
data-related differences prevent the direct application of these methods to
medical images. This work introduces ImplMORe, an end-to-end deep learning
method using implicit surface representations for multi-organ reconstruction
from 3D medical images. ImplMORe incorporates local features using a 3D CNN
encoder and performs multi-scale interpolation to learn the features in the
continuous domain using occupancy functions. We apply our method for single and
multiple organ reconstructions using the totalsegmentator dataset. By
leveraging the continuous nature of occupancy functions, our approach
outperforms the discrete explicit representation based surface reconstruction
approaches, providing fine-grained surface details of the organ at a resolution
higher than the given input image. The source code will be made publicly

Abstract: Cone-Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) is a widely used 3D imaging technique in
dentistry, providing volumetric information about the anatomical structures of
jaws and teeth. Accurate segmentation of these anatomies is critical for
clinical applications such as diagnosis and surgical planning, but remains
time-consuming and challenging. In this paper, we present U-Mamba2, a new

Conclusion: 该方法通过控制重建轨迹的平滑性和连续性，有效提升了CASSI系统的高光谱图像重建性能

Abstract: Coded aperture snapshot spectral imaging (CASSI) retrieves a 3D hyperspectral
image (HSI) from a single 2D compressed measurement, which is a highly
challenging reconstruction task. Recent deep unfolding networks (DUNs),
empowered by explicit data-fidelity updates and implicit deep denoisers, have
achieved the state of the art in CASSI reconstruction. However, existing
unfolding approaches suffer from uncontrollable reconstruction trajectories,
leading to abrupt quality jumps and non-gradual refinement across stages.
Inspired by diffusion trajectories and flow matching, we propose a novel
trajectory-controllable unfolding framework that enforces smooth, continuous
optimization paths from noisy initial estimates to high-quality
reconstructions. To achieve computational efficiency, we design an efficient
spatial-spectral Transformer tailored for hyperspectral reconstruction, along
with a frequency-domain fusion module to gurantee feature consistency.
Experiments on simulation and real data demonstrate that our method achieves
better reconstruction quality and efficiency than prior state-of-the-art
approaches.

Abstract: Reconstructing cardiac motion from cine CMR sequences is critical for
diagnosis, prediction, and intervention. Existing methods rely on complete CMR
stacks to infer full heart motion, limiting their utility in intra-procedural
scenarios where only sparse observations are available. We present TetHeart,
the first end-to-end framework that unifies full 4D multi-structure heart mesh
recovery from both offline full-stack acquisitions and intra-procedural
sparse-slice observations. Our method leverages deep deformable tetrahedra, an
explicit-implicit hybrid representation, to capture shape and motion in a
coherent space shared across cardiac structures. It is initialized from
high-quality pre-procedural or offline-acquired full stacks to build detailed,
patient-specific heart meshes, which can then be updated using whatever slices
are available, from full stacks down to a single slice. We further incorporate
several key innovations: (i) an attentive mechanism for slice-adaptive 2D-3D
feature assembly that dynamically integrates information from arbitrary numbers
of slices at any position, combined with a distillation strategy from
full-slice to sparse-slice settings to ensure accurate reconstruction under
extreme sparsity; and (ii) a two-stage weakly supervised motion learning scheme
requiring only keyframe (e.g., ED and ES) annotations. Trained and validated on
three large public datasets and externally evaluated zero-shot on additional
private interventional and public CMR datasets, TetHeart achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy and strong generalization in both pre- and
intra-procedural settings.

Conclusion: FS-SAM2成功将SAM2的基础分割能力迁移到少样本分割任务，通过LoRA实现高效参数适应，为少样本分割提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: Few-shot semantic segmentation has recently attracted great attention. The
goal is to develop a model capable of segmenting unseen classes using only a
few annotated samples. Most existing approaches adapt a pre-trained model by
training from scratch an additional module. Achieving optimal performance with
these approaches requires extensive training on large-scale datasets. The
Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) is a foundational model for zero-shot image and
video segmentation with a modular design. In this paper, we propose a Few-Shot
segmentation method based on SAM2 (FS-SAM2), where SAM2's video capabilities
are directly repurposed for the few-shot task. Moreover, we apply a Low-Rank
Adaptation (LoRA) to the original modules in order to handle the diverse images
typically found in standard datasets, unlike the temporally connected frames
used in SAM2's pre-training. With this approach, only a small number of
parameters is meta-trained, which effectively adapts SAM2 while benefiting from
its impressive segmentation performance. Our method supports any K-shot
configuration. We evaluate FS-SAM2 on the PASCAL-5$^i$, COCO-20$^i$ and
FSS-1000 datasets, achieving remarkable results and demonstrating excellent
computational efficiency during inference. Code is available at

drivers, cyclists, pets, and tram passengers. We present RailSafeNet, a
real-time framework that fuses semantic segmentation, object detection and a
rule-based Distance Assessor to highlight track intrusions. Using only
monocular video, the system identifies rails, localises nearby objects and
classifies their risk by comparing projected distances with the standard 1435mm
rail gauge. Experiments on the diverse RailSem19 dataset show that a
class-filtered SegFormer B3 model achieves 65% intersection-over-union (IoU),
while a fine-tuned YOLOv8 attains 75.6% mean average precision (mAP) calculated
at an intersection over union (IoU) threshold of 0.50. RailSafeNet therefore
delivers accurate, annotation-light scene understanding that can warn drivers
before dangerous situations escalate. Code available at

*Pu Jian,Junhong Wu,Wei Sun,Chen Wang,Shuo Ren,Jiajun Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Reflection-V模型，通过视觉中心推理数据构建和基于视觉注意力的奖励设计，增强视觉语言模型的视觉反思能力，在多个视觉推理基准上取得显著提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉推理模型在生成长响应时对视觉信息的关注度迅速下降，缺乏有效的视觉反思能力，需要解决这一关键挑战

Method: 1) 利用VLMs和推理LLMs之间的交互代理构建视觉中心推理数据，实现冷启动学习；2) 在强化学习中使用基于视觉注意力的奖励模型来鼓励基于视觉信息的推理

Result: Reflection-V在多个视觉推理基准上表现显著提升，并在视觉推理过程中保持对视觉信息更强且更一致的依赖

Conclusion: Reflection-V有效增强了视觉反思能力，为解决视觉语言模型的视觉反思不足问题提供了有效方案

Abstract: Recent advances in text-only "slow-thinking" reasoning have prompted efforts
to transfer this capability to vision-language models (VLMs), for training
visual reasoning models (\textbf{VRMs}). owever, such transfer faces critical
challenges: Effective "slow thinking" in VRMs requires \textbf{visual
reflection}, the ability to check the reasoning process based on visual
information. Through quantitative analysis, we observe that current VRMs
exhibit limited visual reflection, as their attention to visual information
diminishes rapidly with longer generated responses. To address this challenge,
we propose a new VRM \textbf{Reflection-V}, which enhances visual reflection
based on reasoning data construction for cold-start and reward design for
reinforcement learning (RL). Firstly, we construct vision-centered reasoning
data by leveraging an agent that interacts between VLMs and reasoning LLMs,
enabling cold-start learning of visual reflection patterns. Secondly, a visual
attention based reward model is employed during RL to encourage reasoning based
on visual information. Therefore, \textbf{Reflection-V} demonstrates
significant improvements across multiple visual reasoning benchmarks.
Furthermore, \textbf{Reflection-V} maintains a stronger and more consistent
reliance on visual information during visual reasoning, indicating effective
enhancement in visual reflection capabilities.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合Vision Transformer和Graph Neural Network的统一框架，用于从结构MRI数据中检测重度抑郁症，通过脑图谱和立方体补丁两种策略提取区域特征，并在REST-meta-MDD数据集上取得了78.98%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的重度抑郁症自动检测方法主要使用体素级特征或基于预定义脑图谱的手工区域表示，难以捕捉复杂的大脑模式，需要更先进的深度学习方法。

Method: 开发了统一流程：使用Vision Transformer从sMRI数据提取3D区域嵌入，采用脑图谱方法和立方体补丁方法定义区域，生成余弦相似度图建模区域间关系，最后用图神经网络进行分类。

Result: 在REST-meta-MDD数据集上，最佳模型获得78.98%准确率、76.54%灵敏度、81.58%特异度、81.58%精确度和78.98% F1分数。基于脑图谱的方法优于立方体方法。

Conclusion: 基于脑图谱的方法在MDD检测中表现更优，表明使用领域特定的解剖先验知识的重要性，证明了ViT和GNN结合框架的有效性。

Abstract: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a prevalent mental health condition that
negatively impacts both individual well-being and global public health.
Automated detection of MDD using structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI)
and deep learning (DL) methods holds increasing promise for improving
diagnostic accuracy and enabling early intervention. Most existing methods
employ either voxel-level features or handcrafted regional representations
built from predefined brain atlases, limiting their ability to capture complex
brain patterns. This paper develops a unified pipeline that utilizes Vision
Transformers (ViTs) for extracting 3D region embeddings from sMRI data and
Graph Neural Network (GNN) for classification. We explore two strategies for
defining regions: (1) an atlas-based approach using predefined structural and
functional brain atlases, and (2) an cube-based method by which ViTs are
trained directly to identify regions from uniformly extracted 3D patches.
Further, cosine similarity graphs are generated to model interregional
relationships, and guide GNN-based classification. Extensive experiments were
conducted using the REST-meta-MDD dataset to demonstrate the effectiveness of
our model. With stratified 10-fold cross-validation, the best model obtained
78.98% accuracy, 76.54% sensitivity, 81.58% specificity, 81.58% precision, and
78.98% F1-score. Further, atlas-based models consistently outperformed the
cube-based approach, highlighting the importance of using domain-specific
anatomical priors for MDD detection.

Method: 利用LLMs将原子动作分组为高层事件来增强数据集；开发OpenHOUSE系统，包含专门的流式模块来准确检测相邻动作边界。

Result: OpenHOUSE系统的流式模块在检测相邻动作边界方面表现优异，性能相比现有方法的直接扩展提升了近一倍。

Conclusion: OpenHOUSE代表了流式动作感知向集成强大生成模型方向发展的关键一步，为未来的视频理解系统提供了重要基础。

Abstract: We introduce Hierarchical Streaming Video Understanding, a task that combines
online temporal action localization with free-form description generation.
Given the scarcity of datasets with hierarchical and fine-grained temporal
annotations, we demonstrate that LLMs can effectively group atomic actions into
higher-level events, enriching existing datasets. We then propose OpenHOUSE
(Open-ended Hierarchical Online Understanding System for Events), which extends
streaming action perception beyond action classification. OpenHOUSE features a
specialized streaming module that accurately detects boundaries between closely
adjacent actions, nearly doubling the performance of direct extensions of
existing methods. We envision the future of streaming action perception in the
integration of powerful generative models, with OpenHOUSE representing a key
step in that direction.

Abstract: X-ray imaging is a ubiquitous in radiology, yet most existing AI foundation
models are limited to chest anatomy and fail to generalize across broader
clinical tasks. In this work, we introduce XR-0, the multi-anatomy X-ray
foundation model using self-supervised learning on a large, private dataset of
1.15 million images spanning diverse anatomical regions and evaluated across 12

achieves state-of-the-art performance on most multi-anatomy tasks and remains
competitive on chest-specific benchmarks. Our results demonstrate that
anatomical diversity and supervision are critical for building robust,
general-purpose medical vision models, paving the way for scalable and
adaptable AI systems in radiology.

Abstract: This study investigates the efficacy of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for
fine-tuning large Vision Models, DinoV2 and SwinV2, to diagnose
Radiation-Induced Lung Injury (RILI) from X-ray CT scans following Stereotactic
Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT). To evaluate the robustness and efficiency of
this approach, we compare LoRA with traditional full fine-tuning and
inference-only (no fine-tuning) methods. Cropped images of two sizes (50 mm3
and 75 mm3), centered at the treatment isocenter, in addition to different
adaptation techniques for adapting the 2D LVMs for 3D data were used to
determine the sensitivity of the models to spatial context. Experimental
results show that LoRA achieves comparable or superior performance to
traditional fine-tuning while significantly reducing computational costs and
training times by requiring fewer trainable parameters.

Conclusion: HoloGarment通过创新的隐式训练范式和共享嵌入空间，有效解决了野外服装新视角合成的关键挑战，实现了高质量的360度视图生成。

Abstract: Novel view synthesis (NVS) of in-the-wild garments is a challenging task due
significant occlusions, complex human poses, and cloth deformations. Prior
methods rely on synthetic 3D training data consisting of mostly unoccluded and
static objects, leading to poor generalization on real-world clothing. In this
paper, we propose HoloGarment (Hologram-Garment), a method that takes 1-3
images or a continuous video of a person wearing a garment and generates
360{\deg} novel views of the garment in a canonical pose. Our key insight is to
bridge the domain gap between real and synthetic data with a novel implicit
training paradigm leveraging a combination of large-scale real video data and
small-scale synthetic 3D data to optimize a shared garment embedding space.
During inference, the shared embedding space further enables dynamic
video-to-360{\deg} NVS through the construction of a garment "atlas"
representation by finetuning a garment embedding on a specific real-world
video. The atlas captures garment-specific geometry and texture across all
viewpoints, independent of body pose or motion. Extensive experiments show that
HoloGarment achieves state-of-the-art performance on NVS of in-the-wild
garments from images and videos. Notably, our method robustly handles
challenging real-world artifacts -- such as wrinkling, pose variation, and
occlusion -- while maintaining photorealism, view consistency, fine texture
details, and accurate geometry. Visit our project page for additional results:

TL;DR: 通过自监督学习和领域适配预训练，显著提升了动物行为识别的性能，在两个黑智驾行为数据集上超过了现有最佳方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动物行为计算视觉研究需要大规模数据集，但标签成本高，需要数据效率更高的学习方法

Method: 使用预训练的V-JEPA模型，进行领域适配预训练（DAP），即使用领域内数据继续预训练，无需标签数据

Result: 在PanAf和ChimpACT两个黑智驾行为数据集上，分别超过现有最佳方法6.1%准确率和6.3% mAP

Conclusion: 该方法在动物行为识别方面展示了强大潜力，特别是领域适配预训练无需标签数据，能够有效降低标签成本

Abstract: Computer vision for animal behavior offers promising tools to aid research in
ecology, cognition, and to support conservation efforts. Video camera traps
allow for large-scale data collection, but high labeling costs remain a
bottleneck to creating large-scale datasets. We thus need data-efficient
learning approaches. In this work, we show that we can utilize self-supervised
learning to considerably improve action recognition on primate behavior. On two
datasets of great ape behavior (PanAf and ChimpACT), we outperform published
state-of-the-art action recognition models by 6.1 %pt. accuracy and 6.3 %pt.
mAP, respectively. We achieve this by utilizing a pretrained V-JEPA model and
applying domain-adaptive pretraining (DAP), i.e. continuing the pretraining
with in-domain data. We show that most of the performance gain stems from the
DAP. Our method promises great potential for improving the recognition of
animal behavior, as DAP does not require labeled samples. Code is available at

Conclusion: OmniWorld作为训练和评估的强大资源，将加速通用4D世界模型的发展，推动机器对物理世界的整体理解。

Abstract: The field of 4D world modeling - aiming to jointly capture spatial geometry
and temporal dynamics - has witnessed remarkable progress in recent years,
driven by advances in large-scale generative models and multimodal learning.
However, the development of truly general 4D world models remains fundamentally
constrained by the availability of high-quality data. Existing datasets and
benchmarks often lack the dynamic complexity, multi-domain diversity, and
spatial-temporal annotations required to support key tasks such as 4D geometric
reconstruction, future prediction, and camera-control video generation. To
address this gap, we introduce OmniWorld, a large-scale, multi-domain,
multi-modal dataset specifically designed for 4D world modeling. OmniWorld
consists of a newly collected OmniWorld-Game dataset and several curated public
datasets spanning diverse domains. Compared with existing synthetic datasets,
OmniWorld-Game provides richer modality coverage, larger scale, and more
realistic dynamic interactions. Based on this dataset, we establish a
challenging benchmark that exposes the limitations of current state-of-the-art
(SOTA) approaches in modeling complex 4D environments. Moreover, fine-tuning
existing SOTA methods on OmniWorld leads to significant performance gains
across 4D reconstruction and video generation tasks, strongly validating
OmniWorld as a powerful resource for training and evaluation. We envision
OmniWorld as a catalyst for accelerating the development of general-purpose 4D
world models, ultimately advancing machines' holistic understanding of the
physical world.

TL;DR: LazyDrag是首个基于拖拽的多模态扩散Transformer图像编辑方法，通过显式对应映射消除隐式点匹配依赖，实现稳定全强度反演，无需测试时优化，统一了几何控制和文本引导能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于拖拽的编辑方法依赖注意力机制的隐式点匹配，导致反演强度减弱和昂贵的测试时优化，严重限制了扩散模型的高保真修复和文本引导生成能力。

Method: LazyDrag从用户拖拽输入生成显式对应映射作为可靠参考来增强注意力控制，支持稳定全强度反演过程，无需测试时优化，并支持多轮工作流和同时移动缩放操作。

Result: 在DragBench评估中，LazyDrag在拖拽精度和感知质量方面优于基线方法，经VIEScore和人工评估验证，建立了新的最先进性能。

Conclusion: LazyDrag不仅实现了最先进的性能，还为编辑范式开辟了新途径，能够实现之前无法完成的复杂编辑任务，如统一精确几何控制和文本引导。

Abstract: The reliance on implicit point matching via attention has become a core
bottleneck in drag-based editing, resulting in a fundamental compromise on
weakened inversion strength and costly test-time optimization (TTO). This
compromise severely limits the generative capabilities of diffusion models,
suppressing high-fidelity inpainting and text-guided creation. In this paper,
we introduce LazyDrag, the first drag-based image editing method for
Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformers, which directly eliminates the reliance on
implicit point matching. In concrete terms, our method generates an explicit
correspondence map from user drag inputs as a reliable reference to boost the
attention control. This reliable reference opens the potential for a stable
full-strength inversion process, which is the first in the drag-based editing
task. It obviates the necessity for TTO and unlocks the generative capability
of models. Therefore, LazyDrag naturally unifies precise geometric control with
text guidance, enabling complex edits that were previously out of reach:
opening the mouth of a dog and inpainting its interior, generating new objects
like a ``tennis ball'', or for ambiguous drags, making context-aware changes
like moving a hand into a pocket. Additionally, LazyDrag supports multi-round
workflows with simultaneous move and scale operations. Evaluated on the
DragBench, our method outperforms baselines in drag accuracy and perceptual
quality, as validated by VIEScore and human evaluation. LazyDrag not only
establishes new state-of-the-art performance, but also paves a new way to
editing paradigms.

Abstract: Animated movies are captivating for their unique character designs and
imaginative storytelling, yet they pose significant challenges for existing
recognition systems. Unlike the consistent visual patterns detected by
conventional face recognition methods, animated characters exhibit extreme
diversity in their appearance, motion, and deformation. In this work, we
propose an audio-visual pipeline to enable automatic and robust animated
character recognition, and thereby enhance character-centric understanding of
animated movies. Central to our approach is the automatic construction of an
audio-visual character bank from online sources. This bank contains both visual
exemplars and voice (audio) samples for each character, enabling subsequent
multi-modal character recognition despite long-tailed appearance distributions.
Building on accurate character recognition, we explore two downstream
applications: Audio Description (AD) generation for visually impaired
audiences, and character-aware subtitling for the hearing impaired. To support
research in this domain, we introduce CMD-AM, a new dataset of 75 animated
movies with comprehensive annotations. Our character-centric pipeline
demonstrates significant improvements in both accessibility and narrative
comprehension for animated content over prior face-detection-based approaches.

TL;DR: LEGO bricks是一种可重构的扩散模型主干网络，通过局部特征增强和全局内容协调机制，实现了训练效率提升、可变分辨率生成和采样时间显著减少。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决扩散模型在训练和采样时计算成本高的问题，以及现有网络架构（如U-Net和Vision Transformer）缺乏灵活性，无法适应可变分辨率生成和测试时网络重构的需求。

Method: 提出LEGO bricks模块，集成了局部特征增强（MLP）和全局内容协调（Transformer块），可以堆叠构建可重构的扩散主干网络，支持测试时选择性跳过bricks来降低采样成本。

Result: 实验结果表明LEGO bricks提高了训练效率、加速了收敛，支持可变分辨率图像生成，同时保持了强大的生成性能，采样时间相比其他方法显著减少。

Conclusion: LEGO bricks为扩散模型提供了有价值的增强，实现了高效、灵活的图像生成，在计算成本和生成质量之间取得了良好平衡。

Abstract: Diffusion models excel at generating photo-realistic images but come with
significant computational costs in both training and sampling. While various
techniques address these computational challenges, a less-explored issue is
designing an efficient and adaptable network backbone for iterative refinement.
Current options like U-Net and Vision Transformer often rely on
resource-intensive deep networks and lack the flexibility needed for generating
images at variable resolutions or with a smaller network than used in training.
This study introduces LEGO bricks, which seamlessly integrate Local-feature
Enrichment and Global-content Orchestration. These bricks can be stacked to
create a test-time reconfigurable diffusion backbone, allowing selective
skipping of bricks to reduce sampling costs and generate higher-resolution
images than the training data. LEGO bricks enrich local regions with an MLP and
transform them using a Transformer block while maintaining a consistent
full-resolution image across all bricks. Experimental results demonstrate that
LEGO bricks enhance training efficiency, expedite convergence, and facilitate
variable-resolution image generation while maintaining strong generative
performance. Moreover, LEGO significantly reduces sampling time compared to
other methods, establishing it as a valuable enhancement for diffusion models.

Abstract: Trajectory prediction serves as a critical functionality in autonomous
driving, enabling the anticipation of future motion paths for traffic
participants such as vehicles and pedestrians, which is essential for driving
safety. Although conventional deep learning methods have improved accuracy,
they remain hindered by inherent limitations, including lack of
interpretability, heavy reliance on large-scale annotated data, and weak
generalization in long-tail scenarios. The rise of Large Foundation Models
(LFMs) is transforming the research paradigm of trajectory prediction. This
survey offers a systematic review of recent advances in LFMs, particularly
Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for
trajectory prediction. By integrating linguistic and scene semantics, LFMs
facilitate interpretable contextual reasoning, significantly enhancing
prediction safety and generalization in complex environments. The article
highlights three core methodologies: trajectory-language mapping, multimodal
fusion, and constraint-based reasoning. It covers prediction tasks for both
vehicles and pedestrians, evaluation metrics, and dataset analyses. Key
challenges such as computational latency, data scarcity, and real-world
robustness are discussed, along with future research directions including
low-latency inference, causality-aware modeling, and motion foundation models.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to motion planning and risk analysis for
enhancing human-robot collaboration using a Multi-Rotor Aerial Vehicle (MRAV).
The proposed method uses Signal Temporal Logic (STL) to encode key mission
objectives, such as safety, timing, and human preferences, with a strong focus
on ergonomics and comfort. An optimization framework generates dynamically
feasible trajectories while considering the MRAV's physical constraints. Given
the nonlinear and non-convex nature of the problem, smooth approximations and
gradient-based techniques assist in handling the problem's computational
complexity. Additionally, an uncertainty-aware risk analysis is incorporated to
assess potential deviations from the mission specifications, providing insights
into the likelihood of mission success under uncertain conditions. Further, an
event-triggered replanning strategy is implemented to respond to unforeseen
events and external disturbances. The approach is validated through MATLAB and
Gazebo simulations, using an object handover task in a mock-up environment
inspired by power line maintenance scenarios. The results highlight the
method's effectiveness in achieving safe, efficient, and resilient human-robot
collaboration.

Abstract: Despite the widespread adoption of endoscopic devices for several cancer
screening procedures, manual control of these devices still remains challenging
for clinicians, leading to several critical issues such as increased workload,
fatigue, and distractions. To address these issues, in this paper, we introduce
the design and development of an intuitive, modular, and easily installable
mechatronic framework. This framework includes (i) a novel nested collet-chuck
gripping mechanism that can readily be integrated and assembled with the
existing endoscopic devices and control their bending degrees-of-freedom
(DoFs); (ii) a feeder mechanism that can control the insertion/retraction DoF
of a colonoscope, and (iii) a complementary and intuitive user interface that
enables simultaneous control of all DoFs during the procedure. To analyze the
design of the proposed mechanisms, we also introduce a mathematical modeling
approach and a design space for optimal selection of the parameters involved in
the design of gripping and feeder mechanisms. Our simulation and experimental
studies thoroughly demonstrate the performance of the proposed mathematical
modeling and robotic framework.

Conclusion: Nav-R1通过统一的推理框架和创新的训练范式，有效解决了具身导航中的推理一致性和实时控制平衡问题，展现了优异的性能和实用性。

Abstract: Embodied navigation requires agents to integrate perception, reasoning, and
action for robust interaction in complex 3D environments. Existing approaches
often suffer from incoherent and unstable reasoning traces that hinder
generalization across diverse environments, and difficulty balancing
long-horizon semantic reasoning with low-latency control for real-time
navigation. To address these challenges, we propose Nav-R1, an embodied
foundation model that unifies reasoning in embodied environments. We first
construct Nav-CoT-110K, a large-scale dataset of step-by-step Chains-of-Thought
(CoT) for embodied tasks, which enables cold-start initialization with
structured reasoning. Building on this foundation, we design a GRPO-based
reinforcement learning framework with three complementary rewards: format,
understanding, and navigation, to improve structural adherence, semantic
grounding, and path fidelity. Furthermore, we introduce a Fast-in-Slow
reasoning paradigm, decoupling deliberate semantic reasoning from low-latency
reactive control for efficient yet coherent navigation. Extensive evaluations
on embodied AI benchmarks demonstrate that Nav-R1 consistently outperforms
strong baselines, with over 8% average improvement in reasoning and navigation
performance. Real-world deployment on a mobile robot further validates its
robustness under limited onboard resources. Code:

Conclusion: 该架构通过重新定义软电子中的信号编码范式，为开发具有类人感知能力的可扩展具身智能系统开辟了新前沿，解决了触觉感知的可扩展性和实时性能要求。

Abstract: Human-like embodied tactile perception is crucial for the next-generation
intelligent robotics. Achieving large-area, full-body soft coverage with high
sensitivity and rapid response, akin to human skin, remains a formidable
challenge due to critical bottlenecks in encoding efficiency and wiring
complexity in existing flexible tactile sensors, thus significantly hinder the
scalability and real-time performance required for human skin-level tactile
perception. Herein, we present a new architecture employing code division
multiple access-inspired orthogonal digital encoding to overcome these
challenges. Our decentralized encoding strategy transforms conventional serial
signal transmission by enabling parallel superposition of energy-orthogonal
base codes from distributed sensing nodes, drastically reducing wiring
requirements and increasing data throughput. We implemented and validated this
strategy with off-the-shelf 16-node sensing array to reconstruct the pressure
distribution, achieving a temporal resolution of 12.8 ms using only a single
transmission wire. Crucially, the architecture can maintain sub-20ms latency
across orders-of-magnitude variations in node number (to thousands of nodes).
By fundamentally redefining signal encoding paradigms in soft electronics, this
work opens new frontiers in developing scalable embodied intelligent systems
with human-like sensory capabilities.

Conclusion: 经验证可通过添加独立物理通道检测数据完整性攻击，缩短发现时间，无需复杂仪器

Abstract: Industrial robotic systems are central to automating smart manufacturing
operations. Connected and automated factories face growing cybersecurity risks
that can potentially cause interruptions and damages to physical operations.
Among these attacks, data-integrity attacks often involve sophisticated
exploitation of vulnerabilities that enable an attacker to access and
manipulate the operational data and are hence difficult to detect with only
existing intrusion detection or model-based detection. This paper addresses the
challenges in utilizing existing side-channels to detect data-integrity attacks
in robotic manufacturing processes by developing an online detection framework,
ViSTR-GP, that cross-checks encoder-reported measurements against a
vision-based estimate from an overhead camera outside the controller's
authority. In this framework, a one-time interactive segmentation initializes
SAM-Track to generate per-frame masks. A low-rank tensor-regression surrogate
maps each mask to measurements, while a matrix-variate Gaussian process models
nominal residuals, capturing temporal structure and cross-joint correlations. A
frame-wise test statistic derived from the predictive distribution provides an
online detector with interpretable thresholds. We validate the framework on a
real-world robotic testbed with synchronized video frame and encoder data,
collecting multiple nominal cycles and constructing replay attack scenarios
with graded end-effector deviations. Results on the testbed indicate that the
proposed framework recovers joint angles accurately and detects data-integrity
attacks earlier with more frequent alarms than all baselines. These
improvements are most evident in the most subtle attacks. These results show
that plants can detect data-integrity attacks by adding an independent physical
channel, bypassing the controller's authority, without needing complex
instrumentation.

Conclusion: ImMimic有效弥合了人机领域差距，为鲁棒的机器人操作提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Learning robot manipulation from abundant human videos offers a scalable
alternative to costly robot-specific data collection. However, domain gaps
across visual, morphological, and physical aspects hinder direct imitation. To
effectively bridge the domain gap, we propose ImMimic, an embodiment-agnostic
co-training framework that leverages both human videos and a small amount of
teleoperated robot demonstrations. ImMimic uses Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) with
either action- or visual-based mapping to map retargeted human hand poses to
robot joints, followed by MixUp interpolation between paired human and robot
trajectories. Our key insights are (1) retargeted human hand trajectories
provide informative action labels, and (2) interpolation over the mapped data
creates intermediate domains that facilitate smooth domain adaptation during
co-training. Evaluations on four real-world manipulation tasks (Pick and Place,
Push, Hammer, Flip) across four robotic embodiments (Robotiq, Fin Ray, Allegro,
Ability) show that ImMimic improves task success rates and execution
smoothness, highlighting its efficacy to bridge the domain gap for robust robot
manipulation. The project website can be found at

Abstract: Pogobots are a new type of open-source/open-hardware robots specifically
designed for swarm robotics research. Their cost-effective and modular design,
complemented by vibration-based and wheel-based locomotion, fast infrared
communication and extensive software architecture facilitate the implementation
of swarm intelligence algorithms. However, testing even simple distributed
algorithms directly on robots is particularly labor-intensive. Scaling to more
complex problems or calibrate user code parameters will have a prohibitively
high strain on available resources. In this article we present Pogosim, a fast
and scalable simulator for Pogobots, designed to reduce as much as possible
algorithm development costs. The exact same code will be used in both
simulation and to experimentally drive real robots. This article details the
software architecture of Pogosim, explain how to write configuration files and
user programs and how simulations approximate or differ from experiments. We
describe how a large set of simulations can be launched in parallel, how to
retrieve and analyze the simulation results, and how to optimize user code
parameters using optimization algorithms.

Abstract: Photovoltaic (PV) panels are becoming increasingly widespread in the domain
of renewable energy, and thus, small efficiency gains can have massive effects.
Anti-reflective and self-cleaning coatings enhance panel performance but
degrade over time, requiring periodic reapplication. Uncrewed Aerial Vehicles
(UAVs) offer a flexible and autonomous way to apply protective coatings more
often and at lower cost compared to traditional manual coating methods. In this
letter, we propose a quadcopter-based system, equipped with a liquid dispersion
mechanism, designed to automate such tasks. The localization stack only uses
onboard sensors, relying on visual-inertial odometry and the relative position
of the PV panel detected with respect to the quadcopter. The control relies on
a model-based controller that accounts for the ground effect and the mass
decrease of the quadcopter during liquid dispersion. We validate the autonomy
capabilities of our system through extensive indoor and outdoor experiments.

Abstract: The increasing labor costs in agriculture have accelerated the adoption of
multi-robot systems for orchard harvesting. However, efficiently coordinating
these systems is challenging due to the complex interplay between makespan and
energy consumption, particularly under practical constraints like
load-dependent speed variations and battery limitations. This paper defines the
multi-objective agricultural multi-electrical-robot task allocation (AMERTA)
problem, which systematically incorporates these often-overlooked real-world
constraints. To address this problem, we propose a hybrid hierarchical route
reconstruction algorithm (HRRA) that integrates several innovative mechanisms,
including a hierarchical encoding structure, a dual-phase initialization
method, task sequence optimizers, and specialized route reconstruction
operators. Extensive experiments on 45 test instances demonstrate HRRA's
superior performance against seven state-of-the-art algorithms. Statistical
analysis, including the Wilcoxon signed-rank and Friedman tests, empirically
validates HRRA's competitiveness and its unique ability to explore previously
inaccessible regions of the solution space. In general, this research
contributes to the theoretical understanding of multi-robot coordination by
offering a novel problem formulation and an effective algorithm, thereby also
providing practical insights for agricultural automation.

Conclusion: 该研究通过创新的时频域特征融合方法有效提升了人形机器人的模仿学习性能，为具身智能的发展提供了重要技术支撑

Abstract: The embodied intelligence bridges the physical world and information space.
As its typical physical embodiment, humanoid robots have shown great promise
through robot learning algorithms in recent years. In this study, a hardware
platform, including humanoid robot and exoskeleton-style teleoperation cabin,
was developed to realize intuitive remote manipulation and efficient collection
of anthropomorphic action data. To improve the perception representation of
humanoid robot, an imitation learning framework, termed Frequency-Enhanced
Wavelet-based Transformer (FEWT), was proposed, which consists of two primary
modules: Frequency-Enhanced Efficient Multi-Scale Attention (FE-EMA) and
Time-Series Discrete Wavelet Transform (TS-DWT). By combining multi-scale
wavelet decomposition with the residual network, FE-EMA can dynamically fuse
features from both time-domain and frequency-domain. This fusion is able to
capture feature information across various scales effectively, thereby
enhancing model robustness. Experimental performance demonstrates that FEWT
improves the success rate of the state-of-the-art algorithm (Action Chunking
with Transformers, ACT baseline) by up to 30% in simulation and by 6-12% in
real-world.

TL;DR: ManiVID-3D是一个新颖的3D强化学习架构，通过自监督解耦特征学习实现视角不变表示，无需相机标定即可处理任意视角变化，在10个仿真和5个真实任务中比现有方法成功率提高44.7%，参数量减少80%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视觉强化学习策略在实际部署中因相机视角变化而失效的问题，现有方法依赖精确相机标定或难以处理大视角变化。

Method: 提出ManiVID-3D架构，包含ViewNet模块自动对齐任意视角的点云观测到统一坐标系，以及高效的GPU加速批量渲染模块（每秒处理5000+帧）。

Result: 在10个仿真和5个真实任务中，比最先进方法成功率提高44.7%，参数量减少80%，对严重视角变化具有鲁棒性，展现优异的仿真到真实性能。

Conclusion: 学习几何一致表示对于在非结构化环境中实现可扩展的机器人操作非常有效，ManiVID-3D为解决视角变化问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Deploying visual reinforcement learning (RL) policies in real-world
manipulation is often hindered by camera viewpoint changes. A policy trained
from a fixed front-facing camera may fail when the camera is shifted--an
unavoidable situation in real-world settings where sensor placement is hard to
manage appropriately. Existing methods often rely on precise camera calibration
or struggle with large perspective changes. To address these limitations, we
propose ManiVID-3D, a novel 3D RL architecture designed for robotic
manipulation, which learns view-invariant representations through
self-supervised disentangled feature learning. The framework incorporates
ViewNet, a lightweight yet effective module that automatically aligns point
cloud observations from arbitrary viewpoints into a unified spatial coordinate
system without the need for extrinsic calibration. Additionally, we develop an
efficient GPU-accelerated batch rendering module capable of processing over
5000 frames per second, enabling large-scale training for 3D visual RL at
unprecedented speeds. Extensive evaluation across 10 simulated and 5 real-world
tasks demonstrates that our approach achieves a 44.7% higher success rate than
state-of-the-art methods under viewpoint variations while using 80% fewer
parameters. The system's robustness to severe perspective changes and strong
sim-to-real performance highlight the effectiveness of learning geometrically
consistent representations for scalable robotic manipulation in unstructured
environments. Our project website can be found in

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: RoVerFly是一个基于强化学习的统一控制框架，使用RL策略作为鲁棒跟踪控制器，适用于标准四旋翼和缆索悬挂负载系统，能够零样本泛化到不同配置而无需重新调参。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于模型的方法需要大量调参且难以适应配置变化（如负载增减、质量或缆长变化），而学习型方法缺乏稳定性保证和可解释性。

Method: 使用强化学习策略，通过任务和领域随机化训练，作为反馈跟踪控制器，保持可解释性和结构。

Result: 控制器对干扰和变化动力学具有鲁棒性，在零样本情况下能泛化到不同负载设置（包括无负载、不同质量和缆长），无需控制器切换或重新调参。

Conclusion: RoVerFly提供了一个统一的学习型控制框架，结合了学习方法的适应性和传统方法的可解释性，解决了四旋翼带负载系统的鲁棒跟踪控制问题。

Abstract: Designing robust controllers for precise, arbitrary trajectory tracking with
quadrotors is challenging due to nonlinear dynamics and underactuation, and
becomes harder with flexible cable-suspended payloads that introduce extra
degrees of freedom and hybridness. Classical model-based methods offer
stability guarantees but require extensive tuning and often do not adapt when
the configuration changes, such as when a payload is added or removed, or when
the payload mass or cable length varies. We present RoVerFly, a unified
learning-based control framework in which a reinforcement learning (RL) policy
serves as a robust and versatile tracking controller for standard quadrotors
and for cable-suspended payload systems across a range of configurations.
Trained with task and domain randomization, the controller is resilient to
disturbances and varying dynamics. It achieves strong zero-shot generalization
across payload settings, including no payload as well as varying mass and cable
length, without controller switching or re-tuning, while retaining the
interpretability and structure of a feedback tracking controller. Code and

Motivation: 现有神经运动规划方法通常依赖简化的机器人模型或主要关注障碍物表示，导致在复杂场景中碰撞检测不完整和性能下降，需要同时考虑机器人物理形状和周围环境

Method: 提出空间锚点运动策略(SAMP)，使用共享空间网格上的符号距离场编码环境和机械臂几何形状，包含专门的机器人SDF网络捕获精确几何信息，通过空间锚点融合表示并训练神经运动策略

Result: 在仿真和真实环境实验中，SAMP相比现有方法成功率提高11%，碰撞率降低7%

Conclusion: 联合建模机器人和环境几何形状的方法具有显著优势，在挑战性真实环境中展现出实用价值

Abstract: Neural-based motion planning methods have achieved remarkable progress for
robotic manipulators, yet a fundamental challenge lies in simultaneously
accounting for both the robot's physical shape and the surrounding environment
when generating safe and feasible motions. Moreover, existing approaches often
rely on simplified robot models or focus primarily on obstacle representation,
which can lead to incomplete collision detection and degraded performance in
cluttered scenes. To address these limitations, we propose spatial anchor-based
motion policy (SAMP), a unified framework that simultaneously encodes the
environment and the manipulator using signed distance field (SDF) anchored on a
shared spatial grid. SAMP incorporates a dedicated robot SDF network that
captures the manipulator's precise geometry, enabling collision-aware reasoning
beyond coarse link approximations. These representations are fused on spatial
anchors and used to train a neural motion policy that generates smooth,
collision-free trajectories in the proposed efficient feature alignment
strategy. Experiments conducted in both simulated and real-world environments
consistently show that SAMP outperforms existing methods, delivering an 11%
increase in success rate and a 7% reduction in collision rate. These results
highlight the benefits of jointly modelling robot and environment geometry,
demonstrating its practical value in challenging real-world environments.

TL;DR: DreamNav是一个零样本视觉语言导航方法，通过视角校正、轨迹级规划和主动想象来解决现有方法的高成本、动作语义不对齐和短视规划问题，在VLN-CE和真实世界测试中达到了新的SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的零样本VLN方法依赖昂贵的感知和被动场景理解，将控制简化为点级选择，导致部署成本高、动作语义不对齐和规划短视。

Method: 提出DreamNav方法，包含三个核心组件：(1)EgoView Corrector对齐视角并稳定自我中心感知；(2)Trajectory Predictor进行全局轨迹级规划；(3)Imagination Predictor赋予主动思考能力实现前瞻性规划。

Result: 在VLN-CE和真实世界测试中，DreamNav在SR和SPL指标上分别比最强的自我中心基线高出7.49%和18.15%，建立了新的零样本SOTA。

Conclusion: 这是首个统一轨迹级规划和主动想象的零样本VLN方法，仅使用自我中心输入，显著提升了导航性能。

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments (VLN-CE), which
links language instructions to perception and control in the real world, is a
core capability of embodied robots. Recently, large-scale pretrained foundation
models have been leveraged as shared priors for perception, reasoning, and
action, enabling zero-shot VLN without task-specific training. However,
existing zero-shot VLN methods depend on costly perception and passive scene
understanding, collapsing control to point-level choices. As a result, they are
expensive to deploy, misaligned in action semantics, and short-sighted in
planning. To address these issues, we present DreamNav that focuses on the
following three aspects: (1) for reducing sensory cost, our EgoView Corrector
aligns viewpoints and stabilizes egocentric perception; (2) instead of
point-level actions, our Trajectory Predictor favors global trajectory-level
planning to better align with instruction semantics; and (3) to enable
anticipatory and long-horizon planning, we propose an Imagination Predictor to
endow the agent with proactive thinking capability. On VLN-CE and real-world
tests, DreamNav sets a new zero-shot state-of-the-art (SOTA), outperforming the
strongest egocentric baseline with extra information by up to 7.49\% and
18.15\% in terms of SR and SPL metrics. To our knowledge, this is the first
zero-shot VLN method to unify trajectory-level planning and active imagination
while using only egocentric inputs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决机器人在现实环境中面临的部分和间歇性可观测性问题，传统强化学习方法假设完全状态可观测性，无法应对传感器噪声、遮挡或故障等挑战。

Method: 采用两阶段训练：1）离线多任务预训练学习任务无关的潜在信念编码器（使用状态空间模型和LSTM）；2）通过行为克隆微调任务特定策略。使用重构损失来学习鲁棒的潜在状态表示。

Result: 在MetaWorld和Robomimic的10个机器人操作基准任务上测试，MEMBOT在变化观测丢失率下始终优于无记忆和简单循环基线，在50%观测可用性下保持80%峰值性能。

Conclusion: 显式信念建模对于实现鲁棒、可迁移且数据高效的部分可观测机器人系统策略非常有效。

Abstract: Robotic systems deployed in real-world environments often operate under
conditions of partial and often intermittent observability, where sensor inputs
may be noisy, occluded, or entirely unavailable due to failures or
environmental constraints. Traditional reinforcement learning (RL) approaches
that assume full state observability are ill-equipped for such challenges. In
this work, we introduce MEMBOT, a modular memory-based architecture designed to
address intermittent partial observability in robotic control tasks. MEMBOT
decouples belief inference from policy learning through a two-phase training
process: an offline multi-task learning pretraining stage that learns a robust
task-agnostic latent belief encoder using a reconstruction losses, followed by
fine-tuning of task-specific policies using behavior cloning. The belief
encoder, implemented as a state-space model (SSM) and a LSTM, integrates
temporal sequences of observations and actions to infer latent state
representations that persist even when observations are dropped. We train and
evaluate MEMBOT on 10 robotic manipulation benchmark tasks from MetaWorld and
Robomimic under varying rates of observation dropout. Results show that MEMBOT
consistently outperforms both memoryless and naively recurrent baselines,
maintaining up to 80% of peak performance under 50% observation availability.
These findings highlight the effectiveness of explicit belief modeling in
achieving robust, transferable, and data-efficient policies for real-world
partially observable robotic systems.

Conclusion: CORB-Planner具有通用性和鲁棒性，适用于实际部署，解决了模型不准确性和平台特定细节的过拟合问题。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in a large number of robotic
control tasks. Nevertheless, its deployment on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)
remains challenging, mainly because of reliance on accurate dynamic models and
platform-specific sensing, which hinders cross-platform transfer. This paper
presents the CORB-Planner (Corridor-as-Observations for RL B-spline planner), a
real-time, RL-based trajectory planning framework for high-speed autonomous UAV
flight across heterogeneous platforms. The key idea is to combine B-spline
trajectory generation with the RL policy producing successive control points
with a compact safe flight corridor (SFC) representation obtained via heuristic
search. The SFC abstracts obstacle information in a low-dimensional form,
mitigating overfitting to platform-specific details and reducing sensitivity to
model inaccuracies. To narrow the sim-to-real gap, we adopt an easy-to-hard
progressive training pipeline in simulation. A value-based soft
decomposed-critic Q (SDCQ) algorithm is used to learn effective policies within
approximately ten minutes of training. Benchmarks in simulation and real-world
tests demonstrate real-time planning on lightweight onboard hardware and
support maximum flight speeds up to 8.2m/s in dense, cluttered environments
without external positioning. Compatibility with various UAV configurations
(quadrotors, hexarotors) and modest onboard compute underlines the generality
and robustness of CORB-Planner for practical deployment.

Result: 任务成功率从81.68%提升到100%，平均感知误判次数从3.389降低到1.128

Conclusion: 该研究为提升体现智能系统在复杂工业环境中的稳健性和适应性提供了新的范式

Abstract: With the rapid development of the new energy vehicle industry, the efficient
disassembly and recycling of power batteries have become a critical challenge
for the circular economy. In current unstructured disassembly scenarios, the
dynamic nature of the environment severely limits the robustness of robotic
perception, posing a significant barrier to autonomous disassembly in
industrial applications. This paper proposes a continual learning framework
based on Neuro-Symbolic task and motion planning (TAMP) to enhance the
adaptability of embodied intelligence systems in dynamic environments. Our
approach integrates a multimodal perception cross-validation mechanism into a
bidirectional reasoning flow: the forward working flow dynamically refines and
optimizes action strategies, while the backward learning flow autonomously
collects effective data from historical task executions to facilitate continual
system learning, enabling self-optimization. Experimental results show that the
proposed framework improves the task success rate in dynamic disassembly
scenarios from 81.68% to 100%, while reducing the average number of perception
misjudgments from 3.389 to 1.128. This research provides a new paradigm for
enhancing the robustness and adaptability of embodied intelligence in complex
industrial environments.

Abstract: Social robots offer a promising solution for autonomously guiding patients

advanced decision-making to adapt to patient needs. A key challenge is the
scarcity of patient behavior data for developing robust policies. To address
this, we engaged 33 expert healthcare practitioners as patient proxies, using
their interactions with our robot to inform a patient behavior model capable of
generating exercise performance metrics and subjective scores on perceived

tolerances and fluctuating performance, while also being applicable to patients
at different recovery stages with varying exercise plans.

Abstract: For social robots to maintain long-term engagement as exercise instructors,
rapport-building is essential. Motor mimicry--imitating one's physical
actions--during social interaction has long been recognized as a powerful tool
for fostering rapport, and it is widely used in rehabilitation exercises where
patients mirror a physiotherapist or video demonstration. We developed a novel
Brain-Robot Interface (BRI) that allows a social robot instructor to mimic a
patient's exercise movements in real-time, using mental commands derived from
the patient's intention. The system was evaluated in an exploratory study with
14 participants (3 physiotherapists and 11 hemiparetic patients recovering from
stroke or other injuries). We found our system successfully demonstrated
exercise mimicry in 12 sessions; however, accuracy varied. Participants had
positive perceptions of the robot instructor, with high trust and acceptance
levels, which were not affected by the introduction of BRI technology.

Motivation: 解决零样本方法在视角歧义下的失败问题，以及固定相机在物体移动或自遮挡时的局限性，需要动态的主动感知方法。

Method: 离线阶段渲染CAD模型多视角并计算熵值，构建几何感知提示；运行时使用VLM检测歧义，通过虚拟渲染生成候选相机位姿，选择最佳视角进行重定位；同时引入基于扩散策略的主动跟踪模块。

Result: 在仿真和真实环境中实验表明，该方法显著优于传统基线方法。

Conclusion: 提出的主动位姿估计与跟踪框架有效解决了视角歧义和物体运动带来的挑战，为可靠机器人操作提供了重要技术支撑。

Abstract: Accurate 6-DoF object pose estimation and tracking are critical for reliable
robotic manipulation. However, zero-shot methods often fail under
viewpoint-induced ambiguities and fixed-camera setups struggle when objects
move or become self-occluded. To address these challenges, we propose an active
pose estimation pipeline that combines a Vision-Language Model (VLM) with
"robotic imagination" to dynamically detect and resolve ambiguities in real
time. In an offline stage, we render a dense set of views of the CAD model,
compute the FoundationPose entropy for each view, and construct a
geometric-aware prompt that includes low-entropy (unambiguous) and high-entropy
(ambiguous) examples. At runtime, the system: (1) queries the VLM on the live
image for an ambiguity score; (2) if ambiguity is detected, imagines a discrete
set of candidate camera poses by rendering virtual views, scores each based on
a weighted combination of VLM ambiguity probability and FoundationPose entropy,
and then moves the camera to the Next-Best-View (NBV) to obtain a disambiguated
pose estimation. Furthermore, since moving objects may leave the camera's field
of view, we introduce an active pose tracking module: a diffusion-policy
trained via imitation learning, which generates camera trajectories that
preserve object visibility and minimize pose ambiguity. Experiments in
simulation and real-world show that our approach significantly outperforms
classical baselines.

Conclusion: 量子计算能够显著加速强化学习过程，在复杂高维机器人控制任务中展现出巨大潜力

Abstract: Classical reinforcement learning (RL) methods often struggle in complex,
high-dimensional environments because of their extensive parameter requirements
and challenges posed by stochastic, non-deterministic settings. This study
introduces quantum deep reinforcement learning (QDRL) to train humanoid agents
efficiently. While previous quantum RL models focused on smaller environments,
such as wheeled robots and robotic arms, our work pioneers the application of
QDRL to humanoid robotics, specifically in environments with substantial
observation and action spaces, such as MuJoCo's Humanoid-v4 and Walker2d-v4.
Using parameterized quantum circuits, we explored a hybrid quantum-classical
setup to directly navigate high-dimensional state spaces, bypassing traditional
mapping and planning. By integrating quantum computing with deep RL, we aim to
develop models that can efficiently learn complex navigation tasks in humanoid
robots. We evaluated the performance of the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) in
classical RL against its quantum implementation. The results show that the
quantum SAC achieves an 8% higher average return (246.40) than the classical
SAC (228.36) after 92% fewer steps, highlighting the accelerated learning
potential of quantum computing in RL tasks.

Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models finetuned from vision-language models
(VLMs) hold the promise of leveraging rich pretrained representations to build
generalist robots across diverse tasks and environments. However, direct
fine-tuning on robot data often disrupts these representations and limits
generalization. We present a framework that better preserves pretrained
features while adapting them for robot manipulation. Our approach introduces
three components: (i) a dual-encoder design with one frozen vision encoder to
retain pretrained features and another trainable for task adaptation, (ii) a
string-based action tokenizer that casts continuous actions into character
sequences aligned with the model's pretraining domain, and (iii) a co-training
strategy that combines robot demonstrations with vision-language datasets
emphasizing spatial reasoning and affordances. Evaluations in simulation and on
real robots show that our method improves robustness to visual perturbations,
generalization to novel instructions and environments, and overall task success
compared to baselines.

Abstract: Affordable desktop CNC routers are common in education, prototyping, and
makerspaces, but most lack a rotary axis, limiting fabrication of rotationally
symmetric or multi-sided parts. Existing solutions often require hardware
retrofits, alternative controllers, or commercial CAM software, raising cost
and complexity. This work presents a software-only framework for indexed rotary
machining on GRBL-based CNCs. A custom post-processor converts planar toolpaths
into discrete rotary steps, executed through a browser-based interface. While
not equivalent to continuous 4-axis machining, the method enables practical
rotary-axis fabrication using only standard, off-the-shelf mechanics, without
firmware modification. By reducing technical and financial barriers, the

*Jonas Eschmann,Dario Albani,Giuseppe Loianno*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: RAPTOR是一种训练高度自适应四旋翼控制基础策略的方法，通过元模仿学习训练单个神经网络策略，能够零样本适应多种不同四旋翼平台。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类能够高效适应新环境（如驾驶新车），而现代机器人控制系统（如RL训练的神经网络策略）容易过拟合单一环境，在微小变化（如Sim2Real差距）下就会失效，需要重新训练。

Method: 使用元模仿学习算法，采样1000个四旋翼并训练每个的教师策略，然后蒸馏成单个自适应学生策略。策略通过隐藏层循环实现上下文学习适应。

Result: 仅2084参数的3层策略就能零样本适应10种不同真实四旋翼（32g-2.4kg），在毫秒级别内适应未见过的四旋翼，在各种条件下表现良好。

Conclusion: RAPTOR方法成功训练出高度自适应的基础策略，解决了机器人控制中的过拟合问题，实现了跨平台的零样本适应能力。

Abstract: Humans are remarkably data-efficient when adapting to new unseen conditions,
like driving a new car. In contrast, modern robotic control systems, like
neural network policies trained using Reinforcement Learning (RL), are highly
specialized for single environments. Because of this overfitting, they are
known to break down even under small differences like the Simulation-to-Reality
(Sim2Real) gap and require system identification and retraining for even
minimal changes to the system. In this work, we present RAPTOR, a method for
training a highly adaptive foundation policy for quadrotor control. Our method
enables training a single, end-to-end neural-network policy to control a wide
variety of quadrotors. We test 10 different real quadrotors from 32 g to 2.4 kg
that also differ in motor type (brushed vs. brushless), frame type (soft vs.
rigid), propeller type (2/3/4-blade), and flight controller
(PX4/Betaflight/Crazyflie/M5StampFly). We find that a tiny, three-layer policy
with only 2084 parameters is sufficient for zero-shot adaptation to a wide
variety of platforms. The adaptation through In-Context Learning is made
possible by using a recurrence in the hidden layer. The policy is trained
through a novel Meta-Imitation Learning algorithm, where we sample 1000
quadrotors and train a teacher policy for each of them using Reinforcement
Learning. Subsequently, the 1000 teachers are distilled into a single, adaptive
student policy. We find that within milliseconds, the resulting foundation
policy adapts zero-shot to unseen quadrotors. We extensively test the
capabilities of the foundation policy under numerous conditions (trajectory
tracking, indoor/outdoor, wind disturbance, poking, different propellers).

Conclusion: 明确的质量-接触预测是鲁棒跌倒恢复的关键，为可泛化的四足机器人技能提供了有前景的方向

Abstract: Fall recovery for legged robots remains challenging, particularly on complex
terrains where traditional controllers fail due to incomplete terrain
perception and uncertain interactions. We present \textbf{FR-Net}, a
learning-based framework that enables quadrupedal robots to recover from
arbitrary fall poses across diverse environments. Central to our approach is a
Mass-Contact Predictor network that estimates the robot's mass distribution and
contact states from limited sensory inputs, facilitating effective recovery
strategies. Our carefully designed reward functions ensure safe recovery even
on steep stairs without dangerous rolling motions common to existing methods.
Trained entirely in simulation using privileged learning, our framework guides
policy learning without requiring explicit terrain data during deployment. We
demonstrate the generalization capabilities of \textbf{FR-Net} across different
quadrupedal platforms in simulation and validate its performance through
extensive real-world experiments on the Go2 robot in 10 challenging scenarios.
Our results indicate that explicit mass-contact prediction is key to robust
fall recovery, offering a promising direction for generalizable quadrupedal
skills.

Conclusion: Remote Wire Drive机制成功实现了移动机器人的远程线驱动，为恶劣环境下的机器人操作提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: Operating in environments too harsh or inaccessible for humans is one of the
critical roles expected of robots. However, such environments often pose risks
to electronic components as well. To overcome this, various approaches have
been developed, including autonomous mobile robots without electronics,
hydraulic remotely actuated mobile robots, and long-reach robot arms driven by
wires. Among these, electronics-free autonomous robots cannot make complex
decisions, while hydraulically actuated mobile robots and wire-driven robot
arms are used in harsh environments such as nuclear power plants. Mobile robots
offer greater reach and obstacle avoidance than robot arms, and wire mechanisms
offer broader environmental applicability than hydraulics. However, wire-driven
systems have not been used for remote actuation of mobile robots. In this
study, we propose a novel mechanism called Remote Wire Drive that enables
remote actuation of mobile robots via wires. This mechanism is a series
connection of decoupled joints, a mechanism used in wire-driven robot arms,
adapted for power transmission. We experimentally validated its feasibility by
actuating a wire-driven quadruped robot, which we also developed in this study,
through Remote Wire Drive.

Method: 基于多模态触觉感知的实时闭环规划框架，通过感知交互界面的运动效应自主推断物体交互特征，将交互特征融入栅格地图生成操作成本图，扩展采样规划方法同时优化路径成本和操作成本。

Result: 实验结果表明PaiP在狭窄空间中实现了鲁棒运动。

Conclusion: PaiP框架成功解决了箱柜场景中堆叠物体的运动规划挑战，通过触觉感知和交互成本优化实现了可靠的交互式运动规划。

Abstract: Box/cabinet scenarios with stacked objects pose significant challenges for
robotic motion due to visual occlusions and constrained free space. Traditional
collision-free trajectory planning methods often fail when no collision-free
paths exist, and may even lead to catastrophic collisions caused by invisible
objects. To overcome these challenges, we propose an operational aware
interactive motion planner (PaiP) a real-time closed-loop planning framework
utilizing multimodal tactile perception. This framework autonomously infers
object interaction features by perceiving motion effects at interaction
interfaces. These interaction features are incorporated into grid maps to
generate operational cost maps. Building upon this representation, we extend
sampling-based planning methods to interactive planning by optimizing both path
cost and operational cost. Experimental results demonstrate that PaiP achieves
robust motion in narrow spaces.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 基于Koopman算子的数据驱动方法，通过分段投影策略实现了软连续体机器人的形状控制，解决了高计算复杂度问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前软连续体机器人只能实现实时端点控制，而无法实现整体形状控制，主要因为无限自由度导致的高计算成本

Method: 采用数据驱动的Koopman算子方法，对模拟的多段胎绳驱动软连续体机器人进行分段投影，识别控制伴随的Koopman模型，然后使用线性模型预测控制(MPC)进行形状控制

Result: 方法实现了计算效率高的闭环控制，演示了对不同复杂度目标形状的控制能力，模型精度比无投影策略提高了一个数量级

Conclusion: 这项工作为实际软连续体机器人的形状控制推广奠定了基础，证明了实时形状控制的可行性

Abstract: Soft continuum robots can allow for biocompatible yet compliant motions, such
as the ability of octopus arms to swim, crawl, and manipulate objects. However,
current state-of-the-art continuum robots can only achieve real-time task-space
control (i.e., tip control) but not whole-shape control, mainly due to the high
computational cost from its infinite degrees of freedom. In this paper, we
present a data-driven Koopman operator-based approach for the shape control of
simulated multi-segment tendon-driven soft continuum robots with the Kirchhoff
rod model. Using data collected from these simulated soft robots, we conduct a
per-segment projection scheme on the state of the robots allowing for the
identification of control-affine Koopman models that are an order of magnitude
more accurate than without the projection scheme. Using these learned Koopman
models, we use a linear model predictive control (MPC) to control the robots to
a collection of target shapes of varying complexity. Our method realizes
computationally efficient closed-loop control, and demonstrates the feasibility
of real-time shape control for soft robots. We envision this work can pave the
way for practical shape control of soft continuum robots.

TL;DR: GBPP是一种基于快速学习的评分器，通过单次RGB-D快照选择机器人抓取基座姿态，使用两阶段课程学习：低成本自动标注和大规模数据集，以及高保真仿真优化模型匹配真实抓取结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决机器人抓取任务中基座姿态选择的问题，传统方法需要复杂的任务和运动优化，计算成本高且效率低。

Method: 采用两阶段课程学习：1) 使用简单距离-可见性规则自动标注大规模数据集；2) 通过较小规模的高保真仿真试验优化模型。使用PointNet++风格的点云编码器和MLP对候选姿态密集网格进行评分。

Result: 在仿真和真实移动机械臂上，GBPP优于仅基于接近度和几何的基线方法，选择更安全、更可达的站位，在错误时能够优雅降级。

Conclusion: 提供了一种数据高效、几何感知的基座放置实用方案：使用廉价启发式方法实现覆盖，然后通过针对性仿真进行校准。

Abstract: GBPP is a fast learning based scorer that selects a robot base pose for
grasping from a single RGB-D snapshot. The method uses a two stage curriculum:
(1) a simple distance-visibility rule auto-labels a large dataset at low cost;
and (2) a smaller set of high fidelity simulation trials refines the model to
match true grasp outcomes. A PointNet++ style point cloud encoder with an MLP
scores dense grids of candidate poses, enabling rapid online selection without
full task-and-motion optimization. In simulation and on a real mobile
manipulator, GBPP outperforms proximity and geometry only baselines, choosing
safer and more reachable stances and degrading gracefully when wrong. The
results offer a practical recipe for data efficient, geometry aware base
placement: use inexpensive heuristics for coverage, then calibrate with
targeted simulation.

TL;DR: AssemMate是一个基于知识图谱的LLM机器人装配辅助系统，通过图结构表示知识，相比传统文本方法在准确性、推理速度和上下文长度方面有显著提升


<details>

Motivation: 现有基于LLM的机器人装配辅助方法使用自然语言文本表示知识，存在上下文过长、内容冗余的问题，无法满足机器人实时精确推理的需求

Conclusion: 图结构的知识表示形式比自然语言文本更适合LLM-based机器人装配辅助，能够显著提升性能并满足实时精确推理的要求

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based robotic assembly assistance has gained
significant research attention. It requires the injection of domain-specific
knowledge to guide the assembly process through natural language interaction
with humans. Despite some progress, existing methods represent knowledge in the
form of natural language text. Due to the long context and redundant content,
they struggle to meet the robots' requirements for real-time and precise
reasoning. In order to bridge this gap, we present AssemMate, which utilizes
the graph\textemdash a concise and accurate form of knowledge
representation\textemdash as input. This graph-based LLM enables knowledge
graph question answering (KGQA), supporting human-robot interaction and
assembly task planning for specific products. Beyond interactive QA, AssemMate
also supports sensing stacked scenes and executing grasping to assist with
assembly. Specifically, a self-supervised Graph Convolutional Network (GCN)
encodes knowledge graph entities and relations into a latent space and aligns
them with LLM's representation, enabling the LLM to understand graph
information. In addition, a vision-enhanced strategy is employed to address
stacked scenes in grasping. Through training and evaluation, AssemMate
outperforms existing methods, achieving 6.4\% higher accuracy, 3 times faster
inference, and 28 times shorter context length, while demonstrating strong
generalization ability on random graphs. And our approach further demonstrates
superiority through robotic grasping experiments in both simulated and
real-world settings. More details can be found on the project page:

Conclusion: 提出的适应-投影策略有效且实用，能够实现跨机械臂的零样本适应

Abstract: Diffusion policies are powerful visuomotor models for robotic manipulation,
yet they often fail to generalize to manipulators or end-effectors unseen
during training and struggle to accommodate new task requirements at inference
time. Addressing this typically requires costly data recollection and policy
retraining for each new hardware or task configuration. To overcome this, we
introduce an adaptation-projection strategy that enables a diffusion policy to
perform zero-shot adaptation to novel manipulators and dynamic task settings,
entirely at inference time and without any retraining. Our method first trains
a diffusion policy in SE(3) space using demonstrations from a base manipulator.
During online deployment, it projects the policy's generated trajectories to
satisfy the kinematic and task-specific constraints imposed by the new hardware
and objectives. Moreover, this projection dynamically adapts to physical
differences (e.g., tool-center-point offsets, jaw widths) and task requirements
(e.g., obstacle heights), ensuring robust and successful execution. We validate
our approach on real-world pick-and-place, pushing, and pouring tasks across
multiple manipulators, including the Franka Panda and Kuka iiwa 14, equipped
with a diverse array of end-effectors like flexible grippers, Robotiq 2F/3F
grippers, and various 3D-printed designs. Our results demonstrate consistently
high success rates in these cross-manipulator scenarios, proving the
effectiveness and practicality of our adaptation-projection strategy. The code
will be released after peer review.

Motivation: 传统的具身问答(EQA)只能处理单个问题，但实际部署中需要处理异步到达且具有不同紧急程度的多个问题，因此需要新的并行调度框架。

Method: 提出ParaEQsA框架，包含共享组内存模块减少冗余探索，以及优先级规划模块动态调度问题。使用Direct Answer Rate (DAR)和Normalized Urgency-Weighted Latency (NUWL)作为评估指标。

Abstract: This paper formulates the Embodied Questions Answering (EQsA) problem,
introduces a corresponding benchmark, and proposes a system to tackle the
problem. Classical Embodied Question Answering (EQA) is typically formulated as
answering one single question by actively exploring a 3D environment. Real
deployments, however, often demand handling multiple questions that may arrive
asynchronously and carry different urgencies. We formalize this setting as
Embodied Questions Answering (EQsA) and present ParaEQsA, a framework for
parallel, urgency-aware scheduling and answering. ParaEQsA leverages a group
memory module shared among questions to reduce redundant exploration, and a
priority-planning module to dynamically schedule questions. To evaluate this
setting, we contribute the Parallel Asynchronous Embodied Questions (PAEQs)
benchmark containing 40 indoor scenes and five questions per scene (200 in
total), featuring asynchronous follow-up questions and urgency labels. We
further propose metrics for EQsA performance: Direct Answer Rate (DAR), and
Normalized Urgency-Weighted Latency (NUWL), which jointly measure efficiency
and responsiveness of this system. ParaEQsA consistently outperforms strong
sequential baselines adapted from recent EQA systems, while reducing
exploration and delay. Empirical evaluations investigate the relative
contributions of priority, urgency modeling, spatial scope, reward estimation,
and dependency reasoning within our framework. Together, these results
demonstrate that urgency-aware, parallel scheduling is key to making embodied
agents responsive and efficient under realistic, multi-question workloads.

Abstract: The control of robotic systems in complex, shared collaborative workspaces
presents significant challenges in achieving robust performance and safety when
learning from experienced or simulated data is employed in the pipeline. A
primary bottleneck is the reliance on coordinate-dependent models, which leads
to profound data inefficiency by failing to generalize physical interactions
across different frames of reference. This forces learning algorithms to
rediscover fundamental physical principles in every new orientation,
artificially inflating the complexity of the learning task. This paper
introduces a novel framework that synergizes a coordinate-free, unreduced
multibody dynamics and kinematics model based on tensor mechanics with a
Data-Assisted Control (DAC) architecture. A non-recursive, closed-form
Newton-Euler model in an augmented matrix form is derived that is optimized for
tensor-based control design. This structure enables a principled decomposition
of the system into a structurally certain, physically grounded part and an
uncertain, empirical, and interaction-focused part, mediated by a virtual port
variable. Then, a complete, end-to-end tensor-invariant pipeline for modeling,
control, and learning is proposed. The coordinate-free control laws for the
structurally certain part provide a stable and abstract command interface,
proven via Lyapunov analysis. Eventually, the model and closed-loop system are
validated through simulations. This work provides a naturally ideal input for
data-efficient, frame-invariant learning algorithms, such as equivariant
learning, designed to learn the uncertain interaction. The synergy directly
addresses the data-inefficiency problem, increases explainability and
interpretability, and paves the way for more robust and generalizable robotic
control in interactive environments.

Abstract: Autonomous stocking in retail environments, particularly supermarkets,
presents challenges due to dynamic human interactions, constrained spaces, and
diverse product geometries. This paper introduces an efficient end-to-end
robotic system for autonomous shelf stocking and fronting, integrating
commercially available hardware with a scalable algorithmic architecture. A
major contribution of this work is the system integration of off-the-shelf
hardware and ROS2-based perception, planning, and control into a single
deployable platform for retail environments. Our solution leverages Behavior
Trees (BTs) for task planning, fine-tuned vision models for object detection,
and a two-step Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework for precise shelf
navigation using ArUco markers. Laboratory experiments replicating realistic
supermarket conditions demonstrate reliable performance, achieving over 98%
success in pick-and-place operations across a total of more than 700 stocking
events. However, our comparative benchmarks indicate that the performance and
cost-effectiveness of current autonomous systems remain inferior to that of
human workers, which we use to highlight key improvement areas and quantify the
progress still required before widespread commercial deployment can
realistically be achieved.

Conclusion: 研究结果高度识别了结合开源地图与适应性LiDAR扫描在复杂环境中实现稳健高效定位的潜力。

Abstract: LiDAR-to-OpenStreetMap (OSM) localization has gained increasing attention, as
OSM provides lightweight global priors such as building footprints. These
priors enhance global consistency for robot navigation, but OSM is often
incomplete or outdated, limiting its reliability in real-world deployment.
Meanwhile, LiDAR itself suffers from a limited field of view (FoV), where
motorized rotation is commonly used to achieve panoramic coverage. Existing
motorized LiDAR systems, however, typically employ constant-speed scanning that
disregards both scene structure and map priors, leading to wasted effort in
feature-sparse regions and degraded localization accuracy. To address these
challenges, we propose Adaptive LiDAR Scanning with OSM guidance, a framework
that integrates global priors with local observability prediction to improve
localization robustness. Specifically, we augment uncertainty-aware model
predictive control with an OSM-aware term that adaptively allocates scanning
effort according to both scene-dependent observability and the spatial
distribution of OSM features. The method is implemented in ROS with a motorized
LiDAR odometry backend and evaluated in both simulation and real-world
experiments. Results on campus roads, indoor corridors, and urban environments
demonstrate significant reductions in trajectory error compared to
constant-speed baselines, while maintaining scan completeness. These findings
highlight the potential of coupling open-source maps with adaptive LiDAR
scanning to achieve robust and efficient localization in complex environments.

Abstract: While foundation models show remarkable progress in language and vision,
existing vision-language models (VLMs) still have limited spatial and
embodiment understanding. Transferring VLMs to embodied domains reveals
fundamental mismatches between modalities, pretraining distributions, and
training objectives, leaving action comprehension and generation as a central
bottleneck on the path to AGI.
  We introduce WALL-OSS, an end-to-end embodied foundation model that leverages
large-scale multimodal pretraining to achieve (1) embodiment-aware
vision-language understanding, (2) strong language-action association, and (3)
robust manipulation capability.
  Our approach employs a tightly coupled architecture and multi-strategies
training curriculum that enables Unified Cross-Level CoT-seamlessly unifying
instruction reasoning, subgoal decomposition, and fine-grained action synthesis
within a single differentiable framework.
  Our results show that WALL-OSS attains high success on complex long-horizon
manipulations, demonstrates strong instruction-following capabilities, complex
understanding and reasoning, and outperforms strong baselines, thereby
providing a reliable and scalable path from VLMs to embodied foundation models.

Result: 在ABB IRB 1200工业机器人和GoFa 5协作机器人上验证，实时环境感知显著提高任务准确性和效率28%，系统易用性指数(SUS)提高12%

Conclusion: 该系统推进了直观机器人远程操控、AR界面设计、环境感知和安全机制的发展，收集的示范数据可作为机器学习应用的价值训练数据

Abstract: Traditional industrial robot programming is often complex and time-consuming,
typically requiring weeks or even months of effort from expert programmers.
Although Programming by Demonstration (PbD) offers a more accessible
alternative, intuitive interfaces for robot control and demonstration
collection remain challenging. To address this, we propose an Augmented Reality
(AR)-enhanced robot teleoperation system that integrates AR-based control with
spatial point cloud rendering, enabling intuitive, contact-free demonstrations.
This approach allows operators to control robots remotely without entering the
workspace or using conventional tools like the teach pendant. The proposed
system is generally applicable and has been demonstrated on ABB robot
platforms, specifically validated with the IRB 1200 industrial robot and the
GoFa 5 collaborative robot. A user study evaluates the impact of real-time
environmental perception, specifically with and without point cloud rendering,
on task completion accuracy, efficiency, and user confidence. Results indicate
that enhanced perception significantly improves task performance by 28% and
enhances user experience, as reflected by a 12% increase in the System
Usability Scale (SUS) score. This work contributes to the advancement of
intuitive robot teleoperation, AR interface design, environmental perception,
and teleoperation safety mechanisms in industrial settings for demonstration
collection. The collected demonstrations may serve as valuable training data
for machine learning applications.

TL;DR: 研究表明，在模拟环境中训练的视觉导航策略通过利用预训练视觉表示和实时运行架构，能够匹配甚至超越真实世界训练策略的性能，在导航成功率上比真实世界训练版本高31%，比现有最佳方法高50%。

Motivation: 解决模拟训练策略在真实世界中性能显著下降的sim-to-real差距问题，证明模拟训练策略可以达到与真实世界训练策略相当的性能。

Method: 采用能够弥合sim-to-real外观差距的导航策略架构，利用预训练视觉表示，并在机器人硬件上实时运行。在轮式移动机器人上进行评估，并将同一模型部署到无人机上验证泛化能力。

Conclusion: 预训练图像编码器的多样性对sim-to-real泛化至关重要，模拟训练的on-policy学习相比真实数据训练具有关键优势。

Abstract: This paper investigates how the performance of visual navigation policies
trained in simulation compares to policies trained with real-world data.
Performance degradation of simulator-trained policies is often significant when
they are evaluated in the real world. However, despite this well-known
sim-to-real gap, we demonstrate that simulator-trained policies can match the
performance of their real-world-trained counterparts.
  Central to our approach is a navigation policy architecture that bridges the
sim-to-real appearance gap by leveraging pretrained visual representations and
runs real-time on robot hardware. Evaluations on a wheeled mobile robot show
that the proposed policy, when trained in simulation, outperforms its
real-world-trained version by 31% and the prior state-of-the-art methods by 50%
in navigation success rate. Policy generalization is verified by deploying the
same model onboard a drone.
  Our results highlight the importance of diverse image encoder pretraining for
sim-to-real generalization, and identify on-policy learning as a key advantage
of simulated training over training with real data.

Conclusion: 新方法显著提升了余差策略学习的效果，并且展示了Koopman基于模型在连接现代学习方法与经典控制理论方面的潜力

Abstract: Imitation learning (IL) enables efficient skill acquisition from
demonstrations but often struggles with long-horizon tasks and high-precision
control due to compounding errors. Residual policy learning offers a promising,
model-agnostic solution by refining a base policy through closed-loop
corrections. However, existing approaches primarily focus on local corrections
to the base policy, lacking a global understanding of state evolution, which
limits robustness and generalization to unseen scenarios. To address this, we
propose incorporating global dynamics modeling to guide residual policy
updates. Specifically, we leverage Koopman operator theory to impose linear
time-invariant structure in a learned latent space, enabling reliable state
transitions and improved extrapolation for long-horizon prediction and unseen
environments. We introduce KORR (Koopman-guided Online Residual Refinement), a
simple yet effective framework that conditions residual corrections on
Koopman-predicted latent states, enabling globally informed and stable action
refinement. We evaluate KORR on long-horizon, fine-grained robotic furniture
assembly tasks under various perturbations. Results demonstrate consistent
gains in performance, robustness, and generalization over strong baselines. Our
findings further highlight the potential of Koopman-based modeling to bridge
modern learning methods with classical control theory. For more details, please

TL;DR: Tenma是一个轻量级的扩散-Transformer策略，用于双臂机器人控制，通过跨具身标准化器、联合状态-时间编码器和扩散动作解码器，在异构多模态数据上实现了88.95%的平均成功率，显著优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然Transformer策略和扩散模型的扩展已经推动了机器人操作的发展，但在轻量级、跨具身学习设置中结合这些技术仍然具有挑战性。研究需要探索在异构多模态机器人数据上训练扩散-Transformer策略时，哪些设计选择对稳定性和性能影响最大。

Method: 提出Tenma框架，包含：1）跨具身标准化器，将不同的状态/动作空间映射到共享潜在空间；2）联合状态-时间编码器，用于时间对齐的观察学习并提升推理速度；3）专门优化的扩散动作解码器，提高训练稳定性和学习能力。整合多视角RGB、本体感觉和语言信息。

Result: 在匹配计算资源下，Tenma在分布内测试中达到88.95%的平均成功率，在物体和场景变化下保持强劲性能，显著超过基线策略（最佳分布内平均仅为18.12%）。

Conclusion: 尽管使用中等规模数据，Tenma提供了鲁棒的操作和泛化能力，表明多模态和跨具身学习策略在进一步增强基于Transformer的模仿学习策略能力方面具有巨大潜力。

Abstract: Scaling Transformer policies and diffusion models has advanced robotic
manipulation, yet combining these techniques in lightweight, cross-embodiment
learning settings remains challenging. We study design choices that most affect
stability and performance for diffusion-transformer policies trained on
heterogeneous, multimodal robot data, and introduce Tenma, a lightweight
diffusion-transformer for bi-manual arm control. Tenma integrates multiview
RGB, proprioception, and language via a cross-embodiment normalizer that maps
disparate state/action spaces into a shared latent space; a Joint State-Time
encoder for temporally aligned observation learning with inference speed
boosts; and a diffusion action decoder optimized for training stability and
learning capacity. Across benchmarks and under matched compute, Tenma achieves
an average success rate of 88.95% in-distribution and maintains strong
performance under object and scene shifts, substantially exceeding baseline
policies whose best in-distribution average is 18.12%. Despite using moderate
data scale, Tenma delivers robust manipulation and generalization, indicating
the great potential for multimodal and cross-embodiment learning strategies for
further augmenting the capacity of transformer-based imitation learning
policies.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: VHD框架将规划时域作为学习变量而非固定超参数，通过长度预测器预测实例特定时域，指导扩散规划器生成所需长度的轨迹，提高了规划成功率和路径效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散规划器依赖固定的预定义时域，导致长度不匹配（轨迹过短或过长）和在不同几何或动力学难度实例中的性能脆弱。

Method: 提出可变时域扩散器(VHD)框架：1)使用学习的长度预测器模型预测实例特定时域；2)通过初始噪声整形控制轨迹长度；3)在随机裁剪的子轨迹上训练，无需架构修改。

Result: 在迷宫导航和机械臂控制基准测试中提高了成功率和路径效率，对时域不匹配和未见长度表现出更强的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: VHD框架通过将时域作为学习变量，显著提升了扩散规划器的性能和鲁棒性，同时保持了训练的简单性和离线特性。

Abstract: Diffusion-based planners have gained significant recent attention for their
robustness and performance in long-horizon tasks. However, most existing
planners rely on a fixed, pre-specified horizon during both training and
inference. This rigidity often produces length-mismatch (trajectories that are
too short or too long) and brittle performance across instances with varying
geometric or dynamical difficulty. In this paper, we introduce the Variable
Horizon Diffuser (VHD) framework, which treats the horizon as a learned
variable rather than a fixed hyperparameter. Given a start-goal pair, we first
predict an instance-specific horizon using a learned Length Predictor model,
which guides a Diffusion Planner to generate a trajectory of the desired
length. Our design maintains compatibility with existing diffusion planners by
controlling trajectory length through initial noise shaping and training on
randomly cropped sub-trajectories, without requiring architectural changes.
Empirically, VHD improves success rates and path efficiency in maze-navigation
and robot-arm control benchmarks, showing greater robustness to horizon
mismatch and unseen lengths, while keeping training simple and offline-only.

Conclusion: 该方法通过处理多种不确定性源，实现了复杂户外环境中的稳健、不确定性感知的语义映射，提供了更高质量的3D语义表示。

Abstract: Semantic mapping aims to construct a 3D semantic representation of the
environment, providing essential knowledge for robots operating in complex
outdoor settings. While Bayesian Kernel Inference (BKI) addresses
discontinuities of map inference from sparse sensor data, existing semantic
mapping methods suffer from various sources of uncertainties in challenging
outdoor environments. To address these issues, we propose an uncertainty-aware
semantic mapping framework that handles multiple sources of uncertainties,
which significantly degrade mapping performance. Our method estimates
uncertainties in semantic predictions using Evidential Deep Learning and
incorporates them into BKI for robust semantic inference. It further aggregates
noisy observations into coherent Gaussian representations to mitigate the
impact of unreliable points, while employing geometry-aligned kernels that
adapt to complex scene structures. These Gaussian primitives effectively fuse
local geometric and semantic information, enabling robust, uncertainty-aware
mapping in complex outdoor scenarios. Comprehensive evaluation across diverse
off-road and urban outdoor environments demonstrates consistent improvements in
mapping quality, uncertainty calibration, representational flexibility, and
robustness, while maintaining real-time efficiency.

environment within a limited time duration. Such a model allows for evaluation
of a patrol system against a realistic potential adversary, offering insight
into future patrol strategy design. We show that our new model outperforms

performance against multiple leading decentralized multi-robot patrol
strategies.

Abstract: As robots become increasingly prevalent in both homes and industrial
settings, the demand for intuitive and efficient human-machine interaction
continues to rise. Gesture recognition offers an intuitive control method that
does not require physical contact with devices and can be implemented using
various sensing technologies. Wireless solutions are particularly flexible and
minimally invasive. While camera-based vision systems are commonly used, they
often raise privacy concerns and can struggle in complex or poorly lit
environments. In contrast, radar sensing preserves privacy, is robust to
occlusions and lighting, and provides rich spatial data such as distance,
relative velocity, and angle. We present a gesture-controlled robotic arm using
mm-wave radar for reliable, contactless motion recognition. Nine gestures are
recognized and mapped to real-time commands with precision. Case studies are
conducted to demonstrate the system practicality, performance and reliability
for gesture-based robotic manipulation. Unlike prior work that treats gesture
recognition and robotic control separately, our system unifies both into a
real-time pipeline for seamless, contactless human-robot interaction.

Conclusion: NavFoM展示了跨平台跨任务的强大导航泛化能力，为实际部署提供了实用解决方案

Abstract: Navigation is a fundamental capability in embodied AI, representing the
intelligence required to perceive and interact within physical environments
following language instructions. Despite significant progress in large
Vision-Language Models (VLMs), which exhibit remarkable zero-shot performance
on general vision-language tasks, their generalization ability in embodied
navigation remains largely confined to narrow task settings and
embodiment-specific architectures. In this work, we introduce a
cross-embodiment and cross-task Navigation Foundation Model (NavFoM), trained
on eight million navigation samples that encompass quadrupeds, drones, wheeled
robots, and vehicles, and spanning diverse tasks such as vision-and-language
navigation, object searching, target tracking, and autonomous driving. NavFoM
employs a unified architecture that processes multimodal navigation inputs from
varying camera configurations and navigation horizons. To accommodate diverse
camera setups and temporal horizons, NavFoM incorporates identifier tokens that
embed camera view information of embodiments and the temporal context of tasks.
Furthermore, to meet the demands of real-world deployment, NavFoM controls all
observation tokens using a dynamically adjusted sampling strategy under a
limited token length budget. Extensive evaluations on public benchmarks
demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive
performance across multiple navigation tasks and embodiments without requiring
task-specific fine-tuning. Additional real-world experiments further confirm
the strong generalization capability and practical applicability of our
approach.

Abstract: Describing the world behavior through mathematical functions help scientists
to achieve a better understanding of the inner mechanisms of different
phenomena. Traditionally, this is done by deriving new equations from first
principles and careful observations. A modern alternative is to automate part
of this process with symbolic regression (SR). The SR algorithms search for a
function that adequately fits the observed data while trying to enforce
sparsity, in the hopes of generating an interpretable equation. A particularly
interesting extension to these algorithms is the Multi-view Symbolic Regression
(MvSR). It searches for a parametric function capable of describing multiple
datasets generated by the same phenomena, which helps to mitigate the common
problems of overfitting and data scarcity. Recently, multiple implementations
added support to MvSR with small differences between them. In this paper, we
test and compare MvSR as supported in Operon, PySR, phy-SO, and eggp, in
different real-world datasets. We show that they all often achieve good
accuracy while proposing solutions with only few free parameters. However, we
find that certain features enable a more frequent generation of better models.
We conclude by providing guidelines for future MvSR developments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Zero Inflation Diffusion Framework (ZIDF)来处理降水预测中的零膨胀数据问题，通过高斯扰动、Transformer预测和扩散去噪技术，在多个指标上显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 降水预测面临零膨胀数据的挑战，即大量零值和稀疏非零事件并存，传统方法难以有效处理这种数据分布。

Method: ZIDF框架整合了三个关键技术：高斯扰动平滑零膨胀分布、基于Transformer的时间模式预测、扩散去噪恢复原始数据结构。

Result: 在南澳大利亚观测数据和合成数据上的实验显示，ZIDF相比最先进的非平稳Transformer基线，MSE降低56.7%，MAE降低21.1%。

Conclusion: ZIDF能够鲁棒地处理稀疏时间序列数据，在零膨胀问题突出的其他领域也具有潜在通用性。

Abstract: Zero-inflated data pose significant challenges in precipitation forecasting
due to the predominance of zeros with sparse non-zero events. To address this,
we propose the Zero Inflation Diffusion Framework (ZIDF), which integrates
Gaussian perturbation for smoothing zero-inflated distributions,
Transformer-based prediction for capturing temporal patterns, and
diffusion-based denoising to restore the original data structure. In our
experiments, we use observational precipitation data collected from South
Australia along with synthetically generated zero-inflated data. Results show
that ZIDF demonstrates significant performance improvements over multiple
state-of-the-art precipitation forecasting models, achieving up to 56.7\%
reduction in MSE and 21.1\% reduction in MAE relative to the baseline
Non-stationary Transformer. These findings highlight ZIDF's ability to robustly
handle sparse time series data and suggest its potential generalizability to
other domains where zero inflation is a key challenge.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FEDEXCHANGE是一个联邦目标检测框架，通过服务器端动态模型交换策略解决跨域泛化问题，无需增加客户端计算开销


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦目标检测中，不同客户端的环境、天气等域特定因素差异导致性能下降，现有方法忽视边缘设备硬件限制且计算成本高

Method: 在服务器端交替进行模型聚合和模型交换轮次，通过距离度量对本地模型进行聚类和交换，使各客户端能从其他域的模型中学习

Result: 在挑战性域（如雨天条件）中实现了1.6倍的平均精度提升，同时仅需基线方法0.8倍的计算资源

Conclusion: FEDEXCHANGE有效提升了联邦目标检测的跨域性能，且不增加客户端计算负担，具有实际应用价值

Abstract: Federated Object Detection (FOD) enables clients to collaboratively train a
global object detection model without accessing their local data from diverse
domains. However, significant variations in environment, weather, and other
domain specific factors hinder performance, making cross domain generalization
a key challenge. Existing FOD methods often overlook the hardware constraints
of edge devices and introduce local training regularizations that incur high
computational costs, limiting real-world applicability. In this paper, we
propose FEDEXCHANGE, a novel FOD framework that bridges domain gaps without
introducing additional local computational overhead. FEDEXCHANGE employs a
server side dynamic model exchange strategy that enables each client to gain
insights from other clients' domain data without direct data sharing.
Specifically, FEDEXCHANGE allows the server to alternate between model
aggregation and model exchange. During aggregation rounds, the server
aggregates all local models as usual. In exchange rounds, FEDEXCHANGE clusters
and exchanges local models based on distance measures, allowing local models to
learn from a variety of domains. As all operations are performed on the server
side, clients can achieve improved cross domain utility without any additional
computational overhead. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that FEDEXCHANGE
enhances FOD performance, achieving 1.6X better mean average precision in
challenging domains, such as rainy conditions, while requiring only 0.8X the
computational resources compared to baseline methods.

TL;DR: 本文提出InterRetro方法，将逆合成规划重新构建为树结构MDP中的最差路径优化问题，通过自模仿学习实现最优解，在Retro*-190基准上达到100%解决率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有逆合成规划方法优化平均性能，但忽略了合成路线对最弱环节的敏感性，导致整个合成树无效。

Method: 将逆合成规划建模为树结构MDP的最差路径优化问题，提出InterRetro方法，通过交互学习价值函数和自模仿学习改进策略。

Result: 在Retro*-190基准上实现100%解决率，合成路线缩短4.9%，仅用10%训练数据就达到优异性能。

Conclusion: InterRetro方法在计算逆合成规划领域取得显著进展，提供了单调改进保证和最优解。

Abstract: Retrosynthesis planning aims to decompose target molecules into available
building blocks, forming a synthesis tree where each internal node represents
an intermediate compound and each leaf ideally corresponds to a purchasable
reactant. However, this tree becomes invalid if any leaf node is not a valid
building block, making the planning process vulnerable to the "weakest link" in
the synthetic route. Existing methods often optimise for average performance
across branches, failing to account for this worst-case sensitivity. In this
paper, we reframe retrosynthesis as a worst-path optimisation problem within
tree-structured Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). We prove that this
formulation admits a unique optimal solution and offers monotonic improvement
guarantees. Building on this insight, we introduce Interactive Retrosynthesis
Planning (InterRetro), a method that interacts with the tree MDP, learns a
value function for worst-path outcomes, and improves its policy through
self-imitation, preferentially reinforcing past decisions with high estimated
advantage. Empirically, InterRetro achieves state-of-the-art results, solving
100% of targets on the Retro*-190 benchmark, shortening synthetic routes by
4.9%, and achieving promising performance using only 10% of the training data -
representing a significant advance in computational retrosynthesis planning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 零售供应链中的产品需求预测面临噪声大、特征异构和消费者行为快速变化的挑战，传统GBDT方法缺乏自适应机制来识别和强调变化条件下最相关的特征

Method: AttnBoost框架，在每轮提升过程中通过轻量级注意力机制动态调整特征重要性，重点关注促销、定价和季节性趋势等高影响力变量

Result: 在大规模零售销售数据集上评估，AttnBoost优于标准机器学习和深度表格模型，注意力模块有效减轻过拟合并提高可解释性

Conclusion: 注意力引导的提升方法为现实世界预测应用中的可解释和可扩展AI提供了有前景的方向

Abstract: Forecasting product demand in retail supply chains presents a complex
challenge due to noisy, heterogeneous features and rapidly shifting consumer
behavior. While traditional gradient boosting decision trees (GBDT) offer
strong predictive performance on structured data, they often lack adaptive
mechanisms to identify and emphasize the most relevant features under changing
conditions. In this work, we propose AttnBoost, an interpretable learning
framework that integrates feature-level attention into the boosting process to
enhance both predictive accuracy and explainability. Specifically, the model
dynamically adjusts feature importance during each boosting round via a
lightweight attention mechanism, allowing it to focus on high-impact variables
such as promotions, pricing, and seasonal trends. We evaluate AttnBoost on a
large-scale retail sales dataset and demonstrate that it outperforms standard
machine learning and deep tabular models, while also providing actionable
insights for supply chain managers. An ablation study confirms the utility of
the attention module in mitigating overfitting and improving interpretability.
Our results suggest that attention-guided boosting represents a promising
direction for interpretable and scalable AI in real-world forecasting
applications.

TL;DR: 通过引入选择性反馈机制，研究发现可以逆转大型语言模型在递归训练中的性能退化现象，实现性能提升，称为反自噬效应


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在递归训练中的稳定性问题，挑战现有理论预测的模型崩溃现象

Method: 引入选择性反馈机制，在Gemma 2B模型上进行复杂摘要任务的实验，对比无过滤控制和随机过滤控制条件

Result: 经过五代训练，质量过滤条件下的ROUGE-L F1分数提高了6.6%，而无过滤控制组和随机过滤控制组分别下降了3.5%和4.2%

Conclusion: 系统性韧性可以是LLMs在简单选择压力下涌现的特性，为开发更安全、更稳健的AI系统提供了强大且可扩展的原则

Abstract: The stability of recursively trained large language models (LLMs) is a
foundational problem for AI safety. Prevailing theory predicts model collapse,
a progressive degradation when models are trained on their own output. We
challenge this narrative by introducing a selective feedback mechanism.
Contrary to expectation, instead of merely slowing decay, our experiments
provide strong evidence that this pressure reverses it, inducing a
statistically significant performance improvement in a Gemma 2B model on a
complex summarization task. We name this phenomenon the Anti-Ouroboros Effect.
We contrast this with a foundational experiment using a simple classifier,
where the theoretical degenerative loop was validated, highlighting the unique
dynamics of high-dimensional models. Our findings establish that systemic
resilience can be an emergent property of LLMs under simple selection pressure,
suggesting a powerful and scalable principle for developing safer and more
robust AI systems. Across five generations, a quality-filtered condition
improved by 6.6% in ROUGE-L F1 score, whereas an unfiltered control degraded by
3.5% and a random-filter control degraded by 4.2%

TL;DR: LogGuardQ是一个新颖的强化学习框架，结合人类认知双记忆系统和自适应探索策略，在异常检测任务中显著优于传统DQN和PPO算法，检测率达到96.0%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习算法（如DQN和PPO）在动态环境中存在探索效率低、稳定性差和适应性不足的问题，需要开发更有效的解决方案。

Method: 提出LogGuardQ框架，整合受人类认知启发的双记忆系统和基于温度衰减与好奇心驱动的自适应探索策略。

Result: 在100万条模拟访问日志（47.9%异常）的测试中，LogGuardQ达到96.0%检测率（DQN为93.0%，PPO为47.1%），平均奖励20.34±44.63，统计检验显示显著性能优势。

Conclusion: LogGuardQ通过融合认知科学和强化学习，为不确定环境中的自适应学习提供了可扩展方法，在网络安全和入侵检测等领域具有应用潜力。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has transformed sequential decision-making, but
traditional algorithms like Deep Q-Networks (DQNs) and Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO) often struggle with efficient exploration, stability, and
adaptability in dynamic environments. This study presents LogGuardQ (Adaptive
Log Guard with Cognitive enhancement), a novel framework that integrates a
dual-memory system inspired by human cognition and adaptive exploration
strategies driven by temperature decay and curiosity. Evaluated on a dataset of
1,000,000 simulated access logs with 47.9% anomalies over 20,000 episodes,
LogGuardQ achieves a 96.0% detection rate (versus 93.0% for DQN and 47.1% for
PPO), with precision of 0.4776, recall of 0.9996, and an F1-score of 0.6450.
The mean reward is 20.34 \pm 44.63 across all episodes (versus 18.80 \pm 43.98
for DQN and -0.17 \pm 23.79 for PPO), with an average of 5.0 steps per episode
(constant across models). Graphical analyses, including learning curves
smoothed with a Savgol filter (window=501, polynomial=2), variance trends,
action distributions, and cumulative detections, demonstrate LogGuardQ's
superior stability and efficiency. Statistical tests (Mann-Whitney U) confirm
significant performance advantages (e.g., p = 0.0002 vs. DQN with negligible
effect size, p < 0.0001 vs. PPO with medium effect size, and p < 0.0001 for DQN
vs. PPO with small effect size). By bridging cognitive science and RL,
LogGuardQ offers a scalable approach to adaptive learning in uncertain
environments, with potential applications in cybersecurity, intrusion
detection, and decision-making under uncertainty.

Motivation: 联邦学习框架中经常面临训练数据不足的问题，需要招募工作者收集数据，但缺乏有效的激励机制来协调各方利益。

Method: 建立任务发布者与本地模型所有者之间的Stackelberg博弈模型，使用多智能体马尔可夫决策过程建模本地模型所有者与工作者之间的交互，并设计自适应最优策略搜索算法(ASOSA)来稳定策略。

Conclusion: 提出的自适应激励机制能够有效解决联邦学习中的数据不足问题，最大化各参与方的效用，为分布式模型训练提供了有效的激励解决方案。

Abstract: Recently, federated learning (FL) has emerged as a novel framework for
distributed model training. In FL, the task publisher (TP) releases tasks, and
local model owners (LMOs) use their local data to train models. Sometimes, FL
suffers from the lack of training data, and thus workers are recruited for
gathering data. To this end, this paper proposes an adaptive incentive
mechanism from a service-oriented perspective, with the objective of maximizing
the utilities of TP, LMOs and workers. Specifically, a Stackelberg game is
theoretically established between the LMOs and TP, positioning TP as the leader
and the LMOs as followers. An analytical Nash equilibrium solution is derived
to maximize their utilities. The interaction between LMOs and workers is
formulated by a multi-agent Markov decision process (MAMDP), with the optimal
strategy identified via deep reinforcement learning (DRL). Additionally, an
Adaptively Searching the Optimal Strategy Algorithm (ASOSA) is designed to
stabilize the strategies of each participant and solve the coupling problems.
Extensive numerical experiments are conducted to validate the efficacy of the
proposed method.

TL;DR: 提出MoCE方法，通过双阶段路由机制改进稀疏混合专家模型，在保持计算效率的同时提升专家专业化和泛化能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决MoE在指令调优场景中面对输入异质性时专家专业化不足的问题，提升模型性能和泛化能力

Method: 双阶段路由机制：第一阶段基于序列级特征进行专家组路由，第二阶段在组内进行token级top-k专家激活

Result: 在多个基准测试中 consistently 优于强基线，展现出增强的泛化能力、鲁棒性和有效性

Conclusion: MoCE方法通过有效划分异质输入并促进专家组专业化，成功解决了MoE的局限性，同时保持了token级路由的优势

Abstract: A sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture has emerged as a highly
scalable solution by conditionally activating sub-modules without a
proportional increase in computational costs. However, improving expert
specialization to enhance performance and generalization remains a challenge
for MoE, especially in instruction tuning scenarios characterized by
significant input heterogeneity. In this work, we propose the
Mixture-of-Clustered-Experts (MoCE) to address this limitation through a
dual-stage routing mechanism. The first stage in the mechanism performs expert
group routing based on sequence-level features, while the second stage
activates the top-$k$ experts within the group at the token level. This
approach enables the effective partitioning of heterogeneous inputs based on
their knowledge requirements, encouraging expert group specialization while
maintaining the advantages of token-level routing. We evaluate MoCE across a
comprehensive set of benchmarks, demonstrating its consistent superiority over
strong baselines and its enhanced generalization capabilities. Detailed
analysis further highlights the robustness and effectiveness of MoCE.

Abstract: Continuous attractors are critical for information processing in both
biological and artificial neural systems, with implications for spatial
navigation, memory, and deep learning optimization. However, existing research
lacks a unified framework to analyze their properties across diverse dynamical
systems, limiting cross-architectural generalizability. This study establishes
a novel framework from the perspective of differential manifolds to investigate
continuous attractors in artificial neural networks. It verifies compatibility
with prior conclusions, elucidates links between continuous attractor phenomena
and eigenvalues of the local Jacobian matrix, and demonstrates the universality
of singular value stratification in common classification models and datasets.
These findings suggest continuous attractors may be ubiquitous in general
neural networks, highlighting the need for a general theory, with the proposed
framework offering a promising foundation given the close mathematical
connection between eigenvalues and singular values.

Method: 提出了自适应偏好优化框架UAPO，引入锚函数来估计偏好数据标注的不确定性，支持非配对数据训练，增强了数据利用效率和训练过程的鲁棒性。

Result: 实验结果表明UAPO在不严格依赖数据配对的情况下取得了有竞争力的结果，为更灵活有效的偏好优化方法开辟了道路。

Conclusion: UAPO框架成功解决了传统DPO方法的局限性，通过锚函数设计实现了对非配对数据的有效训练，为离线偏好优化提供了更灵活和高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Offline preference optimization methods are efficient for large language
models (LLMs) alignment. Direct Preference optimization (DPO)-like learning,
one of the most popular approaches, stands out for its efficiency in reward
modeling. However, these methods typically follow the convention to use
Bradley-Terry (BT) reward modeling that faces several critical assumptions,
including the requirement for pairwise training data, model distribution
shifting, human rationality assumption, etc. To address these limitations, we
propose a general framework for offline preference optimization methods,
Adaptive Preference Optimization with Utility Anchor (UAPO), which introduces
an anchoring function to estimate the uncertainties brought from preference
data annotation. Our method enables training even in scenarios where the data
is unpaired, significantly enhancing data utilization efficiency. Moreover, the
anchor design makes UAPO more robust in the training process. Experimental
results demonstrate that UAPO achieves competitive outcomes without the strict
dependency on data pairing, paving the way for more flexible and effective
preference optimization methods.

Conclusion: 联邦学习方法能够在不集中敏感学生数据的情况下提供高效的内容推荐，为现代教育平台的个性化-隐私保护困境提供了可行者解决方案

Abstract: The increasing digitalization of education presents unprecedented
opportunities for data-driven personalization, yet it introduces significant
student data privacy challenges. Conventional recommender systems rely on
centralized data, a paradigm often incompatible with modern data protection
regulations. A novel privacy-preserving recommender system is proposed and
evaluated to address this critical issue using Federated Learning (FL). The
approach utilizes a Deep Neural Network (DNN) with rich, engineered features
from the large-scale ASSISTments educational dataset. A rigorous comparative
analysis of federated aggregation strategies was conducted, identifying FedProx
as a significantly more stable and effective method for handling heterogeneous
student data than the standard FedAvg baseline. The optimized federated model
achieves a high-performance F1-Score of 76.28\%, corresponding to 82.85\% of
the performance of a powerful, centralized XGBoost model. These findings
validate that a federated approach can provide highly effective content
recommendations without centralizing sensitive student data. Consequently, our
work presents a viable and robust solution to the personalization-privacy
dilemma in modern educational platforms.

Conclusion: 正则化基于的FL算法如FedProx在异质性和不平衡临床预测任务中更加稳健和有效，为真实世界医疗应用选择合适的FL策略提供了重要实证基准。

Abstract: Machine learning models hold significant potential for predicting in-hospital
mortality, yet data privacy constraints and the statistical heterogeneity of
real-world clinical data often hamper their development. Federated Learning
(FL) offers a privacy-preserving solution, but its performance under
non-Independent and Identically Distributed (non-IID) and imbalanced conditions
requires rigorous investigation. The study presents a comparative benchmark of
five federated learning strategies: FedAvg, FedProx, FedAdagrad, FedAdam, and
FedCluster for mortality prediction. Using the large-scale MIMIC-IV dataset, we
simulate a realistic non-IID environment by partitioning data by clinical care
unit. To address the inherent class imbalance of the task, the SMOTE-Tomek
technique is applied to each client's local training data. Our experiments,
conducted over 50 communication rounds, reveal that the regularization-based
strategy, FedProx, consistently outperformed other methods, achieving the
highest F1-Score of 0.8831 while maintaining stable convergence. While the
baseline FedAvg was the most computationally efficient, its predictive
performance was substantially lower. Our findings indicate that
regularization-based FL algorithms like FedProx offer a more robust and
effective solution for heterogeneous and imbalanced clinical prediction tasks
than standard or server-side adaptive aggregation methods. The work provides a
crucial empirical benchmark for selecting appropriate FL strategies for
real-world healthcare applications.

2,997 nodes), we demonstrate industry-leading performance: 0% forgetting
(infinite improvement over GEM baselines), 3x compression, and 53% training
time reduction on consumer GPU hardware. Hypothetical cost analyses project
$92.4M savings over 5 years at petabyte scale, with 21.2% energy reduction and
33% lower carbon footprint. This work hypothesizes a paradigm shift for public

Conclusion: 提出的梯度计算方法能有效提升近似乘法器在深度学习加速器中的重训练精度

Abstract: Approximate multipliers (AppMults) are widely used in deep learning
accelerators to reduce their area, delay, and power consumption. However,
AppMults introduce arithmetic errors into deep learning models, necessitating a
retraining process to recover accuracy. A key step in retraining is computing
the gradient of the AppMult, i.e., the partial derivative of the approximate
product with respect to each input operand. Existing approaches typically
estimate this gradient using that of the accurate multiplier (AccMult), which
can lead to suboptimal retraining results. To address this, we propose two
methods to obtain more precise gradients of AppMults. The first, called LUT-2D,
characterizes the AppMult gradient with 2-dimensional lookup tables (LUTs),
providing fine-grained estimation and achieving the highest retraining
accuracy. The second, called LUT-1D, is a compact and more efficient variant
that stores gradient values in 1-dimensional LUTs, achieving comparable
retraining accuracy with shorter runtime. Experimental results show that on
CIFAR-10 with convolutional neural networks, our LUT-2D and LUT-1D methods
improve retraining accuracy by 3.83% and 3.72% on average, respectively. On
ImageNet with vision transformer models, our LUT-1D method improves retraining
accuracy by 23.69% on average, compared to a state-of-the-art retraining
framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的直接奖励模型容易受到上下文和动作的混杂影响，难以分离动作的真正效果

Method: 学习识别哪个动作导致了成功结果，通过比较实际采取的动作与在同样上下文下从日志策略中采样的反事实动作

Conclusion: 计数事实样本识别提供了一种更有效的方法来解决上下文戳机器学习中的混杂问题，提升了模型性能

Abstract: In production systems, contextual bandit approaches often rely on direct
reward models that take both action and context as input. However, these models
can suffer from confounding, making it difficult to isolate the effect of the
action from that of the context. We present \emph{Counterfactual Sample
Identification}, a new approach that re-frames the problem: rather than
predicting reward, it learns to recognize which action led to a successful
(binary) outcome by comparing it to a counterfactual action sampled from the
logging policy under the same context. The method is theoretically grounded and
consistently outperforms direct models in both synthetic experiments and
real-world deployments.

TL;DR: VGM²是一个基于几何的个性化联邦学习框架，通过变分高斯混合流形建模客户端特定几何，在标签倾斜和非平稳环境下实现高效通信和隐私保护。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统个性化联邦学习在标签倾斜和非平稳环境下失败，因为单一全局参数化忽略了客户端特定的几何结构。

Method: 学习客户端特定的参数化UMAP嵌入，用混合关系标记建模潜在成对距离，仅交换变分不确定性感知的标记统计量，使用Dirichlet-Normal-Inverse-Gamma后验和共轭矩匹配聚合。

Result: 在8个视觉数据集上，VGM²在非IID标签分片下达到竞争性或更优的测试F1分数，同时仅传输小型几何摘要。

Conclusion: 该框架通过几何中心化方法有效解决了联邦学习中的异质性问题，提供了通信效率和隐私保护的平衡方案。

Abstract: Personalized federated learning (PFL) often fails under label skew and
non-stationarity because a single global parameterization ignores
client-specific geometry. We introduce VGM$^2$ (Variational Gaussian Mixture
Manifold), a geometry-centric PFL framework that (i) learns client-specific
parametric UMAP embeddings, (ii) models latent pairwise distances with mixture
relation markers for same and different class pairs, and (iii) exchanges only
variational, uncertainty-aware marker statistics. Each client maintains a
Dirichlet-Normal-Inverse-Gamma (Dir-NIG) posterior over marker weights, means,
and variances; the server aggregates via conjugate moment matching to form
global priors that guide subsequent rounds. We prove that this aggregation
minimizes the summed reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence from client posteriors
within the conjugate family, yielding stability under heterogeneity. We further
incorporate a calibration term for distance-to-similarity mapping and report
communication and compute budgets. Across eight vision datasets with non-IID
label shards, VGM$^2$ achieves competitive or superior test F1 scores compared
to strong baselines while communicating only small geometry summaries. Privacy
is strengthened through secure aggregation and optional differential privacy
noise, and we provide a membership-inference stress test. Code and
configurations will be released to ensure full reproducibility.

Abstract: Air traffic controllers (ATCOs) issue high-intensity voice commands in dense
airspace, where accurate workload modeling is critical for safety and
efficiency. This paper proposes a multimodal deep learning framework that
integrates structured data, trajectory sequences, and image features to
estimate two key parameters in the ATCO command lifecycle: the time offset
between a command and the resulting aircraft maneuver, and the command
duration. A high-quality dataset was constructed, with maneuver points detected
using sliding window and histogram-based methods. A CNN-Transformer ensemble
model was developed for accurate, generalizable, and interpretable predictions.
By linking trajectories to voice commands, this work offers the first model of
its kind to support intelligent command generation and provides practical value
for workload assessment, staffing, and scheduling.

Abstract: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition
characterized by atypical brain maturation. However, the adaptation of transfer
learning paradigms in machine learning for ASD research remains notably
limited. In this study, we propose a computer-aided diagnostic framework with
two modules. This chapter presents a two-module framework combining deep
learning and explainable AI for ASD diagnosis. The first module leverages a
deep learning model fine-tuned through cross-domain transfer learning for ASD
classification. The second module focuses on interpreting the model decisions
and identifying critical brain regions. To achieve this, we employed three
explainable AI (XAI) techniques: saliency mapping, Gradient-weighted Class
Activation Mapping, and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis. This
framework demonstrates that cross-domain transfer learning can effectively
address data scarcity in ASD research. In addition, by applying three
established explainability techniques, the approach reveals how the model makes
diagnostic decisions and identifies brain regions most associated with ASD.
These findings were compared against established neurobiological evidence,
highlighting strong alignment and reinforcing the clinical relevance of the
proposed approach.

Conclusion: 该方法通过全局网络视角和数据驱动的方式，有效解决了传统剪枝方法的局限性，为神经网络压缩提供了更优雅的解决方案

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to neural network pruning by integrating
a graph-based observation space into an AutoML framework to address the
limitations of existing methods. Traditional pruning approaches often depend on
hand-crafted heuristics and local optimization perspectives, which can lead to
suboptimal performance and inefficient pruning strategies. Our framework
transforms the pruning process by introducing a graph representation of the
target neural network that captures complete topological relationships between
layers and channels, replacing the limited layer-wise observation space with a
global view of network structure. The core innovations include a Graph
Attention Network (GAT) encoder that processes the network's graph
representation and generates a rich embedding. Additionally, for the action
space we transition from continuous pruning ratios to fine-grained binary
action spaces which enables the agent to learn optimal channel importance
criteria directly from data, moving away from predefined scoring functions.
These contributions are modelled within a Constrained Markov Decision Process
(CMDP) framework, allowing the agent to make informed pruning decisions while
adhering to resource constraints such as target compression rates. For this, we
design a self-competition reward system that encourages the agent to outperform
its previous best performance while satisfying the defined constraints. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments on
benchmark datasets including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet. The experiments
show that our method consistently outperforms traditional pruning techniques,
showing state-of-the-art results while learning task-specific pruning
strategies that identify functionally redundant connections beyond simple
weight magnitude considerations.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于神经科学启发的潜在重放方法，用于解决文本到图像扩散模型在持续学习中的灾难性遗忘和模式崩溃问题，通过存储紧凑的高层特征表示而非原始图像，显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人工神经网络在持续学习中存在灾难性遗忘问题，特别是文本到图像扩散模型在学习新任务时会忘记先前知识并出现模式崩溃。需要一种高效的方法来保持模型在连续学习过程中的多样性和性能。

Method: 采用潜在重放方法，存储模型内部架构提取的紧凑高层特征表示而非原始图像，模拟海马体存储神经活动模式的过程。通过五个连续学习视觉概念的实验验证方法有效性。

Result: 潜在重放方法显著优于现有方法，在学习所有概念后对最早概念的图像对齐度达到77.59%，比基线方法高14%，同时保持了输出多样性。随机选择存储的潜在示例比基于相似性的策略表现更好。

Conclusion: 潜在重放方法为生成式AI模型提供了高效的持续学习解决方案，为实现能够随用户需求演化而无需过高计算成本的个性化文本到图像模型铺平了道路。

Abstract: Continual learning -- the ability to acquire knowledge incrementally without
forgetting previous skills -- is fundamental to natural intelligence. While the
human brain excels at this, artificial neural networks struggle with
"catastrophic forgetting," where learning new tasks erases previously acquired
knowledge. This challenge is particularly severe for text-to-image diffusion
models, which generate images from textual prompts. Additionally, these models
face "mode collapse," where their outputs become increasingly repetitive over
time. To address these challenges, we apply Latent Replay, a
neuroscience-inspired approach, to diffusion models. Traditional replay methods
mitigate forgetting by storing and revisiting past examples, typically
requiring large collections of images. Latent Replay instead retains only
compact, high-level feature representations extracted from the model's internal
architecture. This mirrors the hippocampal process of storing neural activity
patterns rather than raw sensory inputs, reducing memory usage while preserving
critical information. Through experiments with five sequentially learned visual
concepts, we demonstrate that Latent Replay significantly outperforms existing
methods in maintaining model versatility. After learning all concepts, our
approach retained 77.59% Image Alignment (IA) on the earliest concept, 14%
higher than baseline methods, while maintaining diverse outputs. Surprisingly,
random selection of stored latent examples outperforms similarity-based
strategies. Our findings suggest that Latent Replay enables efficient continual
learning for generative AI models, paving the way for personalized
text-to-image models that evolve with user needs without excessive
computational costs.

Motivation: 现有基于MoE架构的Transformer模型在计算效率和长距离依赖捕获方面仍有不足，特别是在专家资源分配的动态适应性方面存在缺陷

Method: 1) 使用分组多头注意力机制降低计算复杂度；2) 设计双尺度共享专家结构，浅层专家处理低维特征，深层专家处理高维复杂语义；3) 提出分层自适应动态路由机制，根据特征复杂度和任务需求动态选择专家级别

Result: 在多个长序列基准数据集上的实验表明，DASG-MoE模型优于现有最先进模型

Conclusion: DASG-MoE模型通过三个模块的有效整合，显著提升了长序列建模的能力，在计算效率和性能表现方面都取得了良好效果

Abstract: Transformer models based on the Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture have
made significant progress in long-sequence modeling, but existing models still
have shortcomings in computational efficiency and the ability to capture
long-range dependencies, especially in terms of the dynamic adaptability of
expert resource allocation. In this paper, we propose a Dynamic Adaptive Shared
Expert and Grouped Multi-Head Attention Hybrid Model (DASG-MoE) to enhance
long-sequence modeling capabilities by integrating three modules. First, we
employ the Grouped Multi-Head Attention (GMHA) mechanism to effectively reduce
the computational complexity of long sequences. By parallel processing through
sequence grouping, local sliding window attention, and feature aggregation, we
address long-range dependency issues and the model's lack of generalization for
local information. Second, we design a Dual-Scale Shared Expert Structure
(DSSE), where shallow experts use lightweight computations to quickly respond
to low-dimensional features, while deep experts process high-dimensional
complex semantics through pre-training transfer and post-training optimization,
achieving a dynamic balance between efficiency and accuracy. Third, we propose
a hierarchical Adaptive Dynamic Routing (ADR) mechanism that dynamically
selects expert levels based on feature complexity and task requirements, and
optimizes resource allocation through a local expert activation strategy.
Experiments on multiple long-sequence benchmark datasets demonstrate that our
DASG-MoE model outperforms state-of-the-art models.

Abstract: Portfolio optimization is essential for balancing risk and return in
financial decision-making. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has stood out as a
cutting-edge tool for portfolio optimization that learns dynamic asset
allocation using trial-and-error interactions. However, most DRL-based methods
are restricted to allocating assets within a pre-defined investment universe
and overlook exploring new opportunities. This study introduces an investment
landscape that integrates exploiting existing assets with exploring new
investment opportunities in an extended universe. The proposed approach
leverages two DRL agents and dynamically balances these objectives to adapt to
evolving markets while enhancing portfolio performance. One agent allocates
assets within the existing universe, while another assists in exploring new
opportunities in the extended universe. The effciency of the proposed
methodology is determined using two real-world market data sets. The
experiments demonstrate the superiority of the suggested approach against the
state-of-the-art portfolio strategies and baseline methods.

Motivation: 研究发现RoPE旋转位置编码中存在内容和位置信息的纠缠问题，这会影响模型性能，特别是在需要独立匹配内容和位置的任务中。

Method: 提出了PoPE（极坐标位置嵌入）方法，通过消除内容和位置信息的混淆来改进RoPE。

Result: PoPE在诊断任务上表现优异，在音乐、基因组和自然语言领域的自回归序列建模中，使用PoPE的Transformer在评估损失和下游任务性能上都优于RoPE基线。在语言建模中，从1.24亿到7.74亿参数的模型规模上都保持了性能优势，并展现出强大的零样本长度外推能力。

Conclusion: PoPE是一种有效的RoPE改进方法，能够解决内容和位置信息纠缠问题，在各种任务和模型规模上都表现出优越性能，特别是在长度外推方面具有显著优势。

Abstract: The attention mechanism in a Transformer architecture matches key to query
based on both content -- the what -- and position in a sequence -- the where.
We present an analysis indicating that what and where are entangled in the
popular RoPE rotary position embedding. This entanglement can impair
performance particularly when decisions require independent matches on these
two factors. We propose an improvement to RoPE, which we call Polar Coordinate
Position Embeddings or PoPE, that eliminates the what-where confound. PoPE is
far superior on a diagnostic task requiring indexing solely by position or by
content. On autoregressive sequence modeling in music, genomic, and natural
language domains, Transformers using PoPE as the positional encoding scheme
outperform baselines using RoPE with respect to evaluation loss (perplexity)
and downstream task performance. On language modeling, these gains persist
across model scale, from 124M to 774M parameters. Crucially, PoPE shows strong
zero-shot length extrapolation capabilities, whereas RoPE's performance
degrades significantly on longer sequences at test time without fine tuning or
the use of position-interpolation methods.

Result: 在多个具有挑战性的任务上验证了SG-LoRA的优异性能和显著的适应能力

Conclusion: SG-LoRA提供了一种高效、隐私保护的个性化模型适应方案，在零样本开放世界设置中实现了实时的用户意图对齐

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has demonstrated strong generalization
capabilities across a variety of tasks for efficiently fine-tuning AI models,
especially on resource-constrained edges. However, in real-world applications,
edge users often exhibit task-specific preferences that are difficult to handle
with a unified model trained under a closed-world assumption, and the challenge
may further increase when there are significant domain shifts between training
and deployment. Meanwhile, retraining/fine-tuning models for each user is also
impractical due to its cost-intensive nature and privacy concerns over raw data
utilization from edges. To address these challenges, we propose Semantic-guided
LoRA Parameter Generation (SG-LoRA), the first of its kind framework to
efficiently produce user-specific LoRA parameters without any additional
training on user tasks or access to user-specific data. Concretely, SG-LoRA
uses task descriptions as the semantic bridge, measuring their proximity to a
set of known expert tasks in a shared embedding space. Based on this semantic
guidance, it models the target task's LoRA parameter distribution to generate
high-performing parameters for novel tasks. SG-LoRA enables the real-time
construction of LoRA models aligned with individual intents by distilling
knowledge from prominent LoRA experts and, meanwhile, offering a
privacy-preserving solution for personalized model adaptation in a novel
zero-shot open-world setting proposed in this work. Extensive experiments on
multiple challenging tasks confirm the superior performance and remarkable
adaptability of SG-LoRA. Code is available at

Motivation: 扩展传统RBM以处理更复杂的几何和代数结构，包括投影变换、旋量动力学和函数对称性，适用于视觉、语言和量子学习等领域。

Method: 将RBM权重推广到抽象群中，引入基于图循环中群值holonomy的contextuality指数来量化局部权重引起的全局不一致性（曲率）。

Result: 建立了与层理论contextuality、规范理论和非交换几何的联系，提供了有限和无限维度的数值和图表示例。

Conclusion: 该框架为AI开辟了新方向，包括曲率感知学习架构和在不确定或对抗环境中的拓扑正则化。

Abstract: We propose a geometric extension of restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs) by
allowing weights to take values in abstract groups such as \(
\mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbb{R}) \), \( \mathrm{SU}(2) \), or even
infinite-dimensional operator groups. This generalization enables the modeling
of complex relational structures, including projective transformations, spinor
dynamics, and functional symmetries, with direct applications to vision,
language, and quantum learning.
  A central contribution of this work is the introduction of a
\emph{contextuality index} based on group-valued holonomies computed along
cycles in the RBM graph. This index quantifies the global inconsistency or
"curvature" induced by local weights, generalizing classical notions of
coherence, consistency, and geometric flatness. We establish links with
sheaf-theoretic contextuality, gauge theory, and noncommutative geometry, and
provide numerical and diagrammatic examples in both finite and infinite
dimensions.
  This framework opens novel directions in AI, from curvature-aware learning
architectures to topological regularization in uncertain or adversarial
environments.

Motivation: 联邦学习在资源受限设备上训练深度网络时，需要在并行性能和统计性能之间权衡。大批次训练虽然能提高训练速度，但会导致泛化性能下降。

Method: 探索小批次和大批次训练之间的权衡，提出新的大批次训练技术，旨在同时享受大批次的并行扩展优势和小批次的良好泛化性能。

Result: 在相同迭代次数下，所提方法在ResNet50和VGG11模型上分别比小批次训练获得约32.33%和3.74%的更高测试精度。

Conclusion: 该技术成功解决了联邦学习中大批次训练导致的泛化性能下降问题，实现了训练速度和模型性能的双重提升。

Abstract: Efficient Federated learning (FL) is crucial for training deep networks over
devices with limited compute resources and bounded networks. With the advent of
big data, devices either generate or collect multimodal data to train either
generic or local-context aware networks, particularly when data privacy and
locality is vital. FL algorithms generally trade-off between parallel and
statistical performance, improving model quality at the cost of higher
communication frequency, or vice versa. Under frequent synchronization
settings, FL over a large cluster of devices may perform more work per-training
iteration by processing a larger global batch-size, thus attaining considerable
training speedup. However, this may result in poor test performance (i.e., low
test loss or accuracy) due to generalization degradation issues associated with
large-batch training. To address these challenges with large-batches, this work
proposes our vision of exploiting the trade-offs between small and large-batch
training, and explore new directions to enjoy both the parallel scaling of
large-batches and good generalizability of small-batch training. For the same
number of iterations, we observe that our proposed large-batch training
technique attains about 32.33% and 3.74% higher test accuracy than small-batch
training in ResNet50 and VGG11 models respectively.

Conclusion: 虽然无法完全捕捉纵向复杂性，但DualAlign为生成临床基础、隐私保护的合成数据提供了实用方法，支持低资源临床文本分析

Abstract: Synthetic clinical data are increasingly important for advancing AI in
healthcare, given strict privacy constraints on real-world EHRs, limited
availability of annotated rare-condition data, and systemic biases in
observational datasets. While large language models (LLMs) can generate fluent
clinical text, producing synthetic data that is both realistic and clinically
meaningful remains challenging. We introduce DualAlign, a framework that
enhances statistical fidelity and clinical plausibility through dual alignment:
(1) statistical alignment, which conditions generation on patient demographics
and risk factors; and (2) semantic alignment, which incorporates real-world
symptom trajectories to guide content generation. Using Alzheimer's disease
(AD) as a case study, DualAlign produces context-grounded symptom-level
sentences that better reflect real-world clinical documentation. Fine-tuning an
LLaMA 3.1-8B model with a combination of DualAlign-generated and
human-annotated data yields substantial performance gains over models trained
on gold data alone or unguided synthetic baselines. While DualAlign does not
fully capture longitudinal complexity, it offers a practical approach for
generating clinically grounded, privacy-preserving synthetic data to support
low-resource clinical text analysis.

Motivation: 大地测量时间序列（如GNSS位置、卫星测高SSH、验潮仪记录）对于监测地表形变和海平面变化至关重要，但这类数据的非线性、非平稳性和不完整性给传统模型带来挑战，需要开发更有效的预测工具。

Method: 开发了GTS Forecaster开源包，集成了核注意力网络(KAN)、基于图神经网络的门控循环单元(GNNGRU)和时间感知图神经网络(TimeGNN)等深度学习模型，并提供包括异常值检测和基于强化学习的Kalman-TransFusion插值框架(KTIF)等预处理工具。

Result: 该软件包能够有效建模非线性时空模式，支持GNSS、SSH和TG数据集的预测、可视化和评估，并适用于一般时间序列应用。

Conclusion: GTS Forecaster通过将先进模型与易用接口相结合，促进了深度学习在大地测量预测任务中的应用，有助于增强地震、滑坡、海岸风暴潮和海平面变化等灾害的早期预警系统。

Abstract: Geodetic time series -- such as Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)
positions, satellite altimetry-derived sea surface height (SSH), and tide gauge
(TG) records -- is essential for monitoring surface deformation and sea level
change. Accurate forecasts of these variables can enhance early warning systems
and support hazard mitigation for earthquakes, landslides, coastal storm surge,
and long-term sea level. However, the nonlinear, non-stationary, and incomplete
nature of such variables presents significant challenges for classic models,
which often fail to capture long-term dependencies and complex spatiotemporal
dynamics. We introduce GTS Forecaster, an open-source Python package for
geodetic time series forecasting. It integrates advanced deep learning models
-- including kernel attention networks (KAN), graph neural network-based gated
recurrent units (GNNGRU), and time-aware graph neural networks (TimeGNN) -- to
effectively model nonlinear spatial-temporal patterns. The package also
provides robust preprocessing tools, including outlier detection and a
reinforcement learning-based gap-filling algorithm, the Kalman-TransFusion
Interpolation Framework (KTIF). GTS Forecaster currently supports forecasting,
visualization, and evaluation of GNSS, SSH, and TG datasets, and is adaptable
to general time series applications. By combining cutting-edge models with an
accessible interface, it facilitates the application of deep learning in
geodetic forecasting tasks.

Abstract: Signature-based methods have recently gained significant traction in machine
learning for sequential data. In particular, signature kernels have emerged as
powerful discriminators and training losses for generative models on
time-series, notably in quantitative finance. However, existing implementations
do not scale to the dataset sizes and sequence lengths encountered in practice.
We present pySigLib, a high-performance Python library offering optimised
implementations of signatures and signature kernels on CPU and GPU, fully
compatible with PyTorch's automatic differentiation. Beyond an efficient
software stack for large-scale signature-based computation, we introduce a
novel differentiation scheme for signature kernels that delivers accurate
gradients at a fraction of the runtime of existing libraries.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种寻找最优多边际薛定谔桥的方法，通过在所有可能的图结构中寻找最优耦合，最终转化为在测度值顶点上求解最小生成树问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多边际薛定谔桥(MSB)需要在已知统计量和相关结构的随机向量集合中找到最优耦合，但传统方法需要预先指定图结构。本文旨在寻找在所有可能图结构中的最优MSB。

Method: 将最优MSB问题转化为测度值顶点上的最小生成树问题。解决方法分为两步：1)构建完全图，边权重为对应双边际SB的最优值加上端点熵的和；2)在该加权完全图上求解标准最小生成树问题。

Result: 提出的方法能够有效计算最优多边际薛定谔桥，数值实验验证了该解决方案的有效性。

Conclusion: 最优多边际薛定谔桥问题可以通过最小生成树算法高效求解，该方法为处理多变量最优传输问题提供了新的思路。

Abstract: The Multimarginal Schr\"odinger Bridge (MSB) finds the optimal coupling among
a collection of random vectors with known statistics and a known correlation
structure. In the MSB formulation, this correlation structure is specified
\emph{a priori} as an undirected connected graph with measure-valued vertices.
In this work, we formulate and solve the problem of finding the optimal MSB in
the sense we seek the optimal coupling over all possible graph structures. We
find that computing the optimal MSB amounts to solving the minimum spanning
tree problem over measure-valued vertices. We show that the resulting problem
can be solved in two steps. The first step constructs a complete graph with
edge weight equal to a sum of the optimal value of the corresponding bimarginal
SB and the entropies of the endpoints. The second step solves a standard
minimum spanning tree problem over that complete weighted graph. Numerical
experiments illustrate the proposed solution.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决非线性系统辨识中可解释性与灵活性之间的权衡问题，需要整合物理约束，同时保持对复杂非线性行为的建模能力。

Method: 使用特征曲线(CC)概念，每个非线性函数由专用神经网络建模。提出三种策略：SINDy-CC(稀疏回归+方程结构约束)、Poly-CC(高次多项式)、NN-CC(无基函数假设的神经网络)。

Result: 三种方法都适用于简单多项式非线性系统(如van der Pol振荡器)，NN-CC在处理复杂非线性和不连续性系统(如粘滑系统)时表现最优。

Conclusion: 基于CC的框架，特别是NN-CC方法，能够在保持可解释性的同时捕捉复杂非线性，为传统多项式或稀疏回归方法难以处理的系统提供了强大工具。

Abstract: Nonlinear system identification often involves a fundamental trade-off
between interpretability and flexibility, often requiring the incorporation of
physical constraints. We propose a unified data-driven framework that combines
the mathematical structure of the governing differential equations with the
flexibility of neural networks (NNs). At the core of our approach is the
concept of characteristic curves (CCs), which represent individual nonlinear
functions (e.g., friction and restoring components) of the system. Each CC is
modeled by a dedicated NN, enabling a modular and interpretable representation
of the system equation. To demonstrate the versatility of the CC-based
formalism, we introduce three identification strategies: (1) SINDy-CC, which
extends the sparse regression approach of SINDy by incorporating the
mathematical structure of the governing equations as constraints; (2) Poly-CC,
which represents each CC using high-degree polynomials; and (3) NN-CC, which
uses NNs without requiring prior assumptions about basis functions. Our results
show that all three approaches are well-suited for systems with simple
polynomial nonlinearities, such as the van der Pol oscillator. In contrast,
NN-CC demonstrates superior performance in modeling systems with complex
nonlinearities and discontinuities, such as those observed in stick-slip
systems. The key contribution of this work is to demonstrate that the CC-based
framework, particularly the NN-CC approach, can capture complex nonlinearities
while maintaining interpretability through the explicit representation of the
CCs. This balance makes it well-suited for modeling systems with
discontinuities and complex nonlinearities that are challenging to assess using
traditional polynomial or sparse regression methods, providing a powerful tool
for nonlinear system identification.

Motivation: 解决GestaltMatcher框架依赖集中式数据集的问题，由于患者数据分散在不同机构且受严格隐私法规限制，需要开发隐私保护的分布式训练方法。

Result: 联邦服务保持了90%以上的集中式性能，对不同机构数量和异构数据分布具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 联邦GestaltMatcher服务成功实现了隐私保护的协作学习，为面部畸形学诊断提供了可行的分布式解决方案。

Abstract: Machine learning has shown promise in facial dysmorphology, where
characteristic facial features provide diagnostic clues for rare genetic
disorders. GestaltMatcher, a leading framework in this field, has demonstrated
clinical utility across multiple studies, but its reliance on centralized
datasets limits further development, as patient data are siloed across
institutions and subject to strict privacy regulations. We introduce a
federated GestaltMatcher service based on a cross-silo horizontal federated
learning framework, which allows hospitals to collaboratively train a global
ensemble feature extractor without sharing patient images. Patient data are
mapped into a shared latent space, and a privacy-preserving kernel matrix
computation framework enables syndrome inference and discovery while
safeguarding confidentiality. New participants can directly benefit from and
contribute to the system by adopting the global feature extractor and kernel
configuration from previous training rounds. Experiments show that the
federated service retains over 90% of centralized performance and remains
robust to both varying silo numbers and heterogeneous data distributions.

TL;DR: 通过测试时前熬方法，利用弱监督辅助任务数据实现多模态大语言模型在测试实例上的自适应，显著提升复杂推理任务性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型尽管各组件领域领先，但整体多模态训练数据量较少，导致复杂推理任务表现弱弱

Method: 提出Test-Time Warmup方法，在测试时候利用弱监督辅助任务的数据对每个测试实例进行自适应，而非依赖大量标签数据细调

Result: 在Llama-Vision-Instruct模型上实现显著性能提升：MMMU提升4.03%，VQA-Rad提升5.28%，GQA提升1.63%

Conclusion: 测试前前熬能够有效提升多模态大语言模型在多样化推理任务上的稳健性

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) hold great promise for advanced
reasoning at the intersection of text and images, yet they have not fully
realized this potential. MLLMs typically integrate an LLM, a vision encoder,
and a connector that maps the vision encoder's embeddings into the LLM's text
embedding space. Although each component is pretrained on massive datasets with
billions of samples, the entire multimodal model is typically trained on only
thousands (or a few million) samples, which can result in weak performance on
complex reasoning tasks. To address these shortcomings, instead of relying on
extensive labeled datasets for fine-tuning, we propose a Test-Time Warmup
method that adapts the MLLM per test instance by leveraging data from weakly
supervised auxiliary tasks. With our approach, we observe a relative
performance improvement of 4.03% on MMMU, 5.28% on VQA-Rad, and 1.63% on GQA on
the Llama-Vision-Instruct model. Our method demonstrates that 'warming up'
before inference can enhance MLLMs' robustness across diverse reasoning tasks.

Motivation: 解决多自主代理协调和长期理性问题，因为设计适当的奖励函数构建复杂且具有挑战性

Method: 采用自监督目标达成技术，让代理最大化访问特定目标状态的概率，仅需单一目标状态指定任务

Result: 在MARL基准测试中表现超过其他接受同样稀疏奖励信号的方法，虽无显式探索机制但出现了协作和探索行为

Conclusion: 自监督多代理目标达成方法能够有效处理稀疏奖励下的协作问题，通过目标导向的方式实现了自然的探索和协作

Abstract: For groups of autonomous agents to achieve a particular goal, they must
engage in coordination and long-horizon reasoning. However, designing reward
functions to elicit such behavior is challenging. In this paper, we study how
self-supervised goal-reaching techniques can be leveraged to enable agents to
cooperate. The key idea is that, rather than have agents maximize some scalar
reward, agents aim to maximize the likelihood of visiting a certain goal. This
problem setting enables human users to specify tasks via a single goal state
rather than implementing a complex reward function. While the feedback signal
is quite sparse, we will demonstrate that self-supervised goal-reaching
techniques enable agents to learn from such feedback. On MARL benchmarks, our
proposed method outperforms alternative approaches that have access to the same
sparse reward signal as our method. While our method has no explicit mechanism
for exploration, we observe that self-supervised multi-agent goal-reaching
leads to emergent cooperation and exploration in settings where alternative
approaches never witness a single successful trial.

TL;DR: M4GN是一个三层分段层次网络，通过混合分割策略和置换不变聚合器，解决了传统网格GNN在大规模长程网格上的高成本和过平滑问题，在多个基准数据集上实现了56%的准确率提升和22%的推理加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于网格的图神经网络在大型长程网格上深度消息传递带来的高计算成本和过平滑问题，同时克服层次GNN在构建粗化图和保持精细尺度精度方面的挑战。

Method: 采用三层分段层次网络架构：1）混合分割策略结合快速图分割器和基于模态分解特征的超像素式细化；2）置换不变聚合器编码连续段；3）微观GNN捕获局部动态，宏观Transformer跨段高效推理。

Result: 在多个代表性基准数据集上，M4GN比最先进的基线方法提高了56%的预测准确率，同时实现了22%更快的推理速度。

Conclusion: M4GN通过分段中心的层次化设计，在保持精细尺度精度的同时显著提升了计算效率，为大规模PDE模拟提供了有效的图神经网络替代方案。

Abstract: Mesh-based graph neural networks (GNNs) have become effective surrogates for
PDE simulations, yet their deep message passing incurs high cost and
over-smoothing on large, long-range meshes; hierarchical GNNs shorten
propagation paths but still face two key obstacles: (i) building coarse graphs
that respect mesh topology, geometry, and physical discontinuities, and (ii)
maintaining fine-scale accuracy without sacrificing the speed gained from
coarsening. We tackle these challenges with M4GN, a three-tier, segment-centric
hierarchical network. M4GN begins with a hybrid segmentation strategy that
pairs a fast graph partitioner with a superpixel-style refinement guided by
modal-decomposition features, producing contiguous segments of dynamically
consistent nodes. These segments are encoded by a permutation-invariant
aggregator, avoiding the order sensitivity and quadratic cost of aggregation
approaches used in prior works. The resulting information bridges a micro-level
GNN, which captures local dynamics, and a macro-level transformer that reasons
efficiently across segments, achieving a principled balance between accuracy
and efficiency. Evaluated on multiple representative benchmark datasets, M4GN
improves prediction accuracy by up to 56% while achieving up to 22% faster
inference than state-of-the-art baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多标签学习中收集完整标签注释成本高昂，许多数据集每个训练实例只标注单个正标签，但实际存在多个相关标签，这种单正标签多标签学习(SPMLL)由于极端部分监督而具有挑战性。

Method: 基于保形预测的模型无关方法，产生校准的集合值输出，弥合单标签训练和多标签评估之间的监督差距。

Result: 在12个基准数据集上评估，相比现有基线方法展现出持续改进和实际应用价值。

Conclusion: 该方法能够在不依赖标签分布假设的情况下，有效解决单正标签多标签学习问题，提供可靠的多标签预测性能。

Abstract: Multi-label learning often requires identifying all relevant labels for
training instances, but collecting full label annotations is costly and
labor-intensive. In many datasets, only a single positive label is annotated
per training instance, despite the presence of multiple relevant labels. This
setting, known as single-positive multi-label learning (SPMLL), presents a
significant challenge due to its extreme form of partial supervision. We
propose a model-agnostic approach to SPMLL that draws on conformal prediction
to produce calibrated set-valued outputs, enabling reliable multi-label
predictions at test time. Our method bridges the supervision gap between
single-label training and multi-label evaluation without relying on label
distribution assumptions. We evaluate our approach on 12 benchmark datasets,
demonstrating consistent improvements over existing baselines and practical
applicability.

Result: 证明了测度值凸优化问题存在闭式解，数值示例验证了方法的有效性

Conclusion: 该方法能够通过自适应分布更新在首价拍卖中实现更优的投标策略，特别适用于具有丰富上下文信息的场景

Abstract: This work proposes a bid shading strategy for first-price auctions as a
measure-valued optimization problem. We consider a standard parametric form for
bid shading and formulate the problem as convex optimization over the joint
distribution of shading parameters. After each auction, the shading parameter
distribution is adapted via a regularized Wasserstein-proximal update with a
data-driven energy functional. This energy functional is conditional on the
context, i.e., on publisher/user attributes such as domain, ad slot type,
device, or location. The proposed algorithm encourages the bid distribution to
place more weight on values with higher expected surplus, i.e., where the win
probability and the value gap are both large. We show that the resulting
measure-valued convex optimization problem admits a closed form solution. A
numerical example illustrates the proposed method.

Abstract: Modern machine learning frameworks support very large models by incorporating
parallelism and optimization techniques. Yet, these very techniques add new
layers of complexity, introducing silent errors that severely degrade model
performance. Existing solutions are either ad hoc or too costly for production.
  We present Scalify, a lightweight framework that exposes silent errors by
verifying semantic equivalence of computational graphs using equality
saturation and Datalog-style reasoning. To scale, Scalify partitions graphs
with parallel rewriting and layer memoization, reuses rewrite templates, and
augments equality saturation with relational reasoning and symbolic bijection
inference. It further localizes discrepancies to precise code sites, turning
verification results into actionable debugging guidance. Scalify verifies
models as large as Llama-3.1-405B within minutes on a commodity machine and
exposed five unknown bugs in Amazon production machine learning frameworks.

Conclusion: 提出的贝叶斯框架方法能够有效处理顺序微调中的分布漂移和不确定性管理问题，为延迟关键环境下的顺序学习提供了数据高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Sequential fine-tuning of transformers is useful when new data arrive
sequentially, especially with shifting distributions. Unlike batch learning,
sequential learning demands that training be stabilized despite a small amount
of data by balancing new information and previously learned knowledge in the
pre-trained models. This challenge is further complicated when training is to
be completed in latency-critical environments and learning must additionally
quantify and be mediated by uncertainty. Motivated by these challenges, we
propose a novel method that frames sequential fine-tuning as a posterior
inference problem within a Bayesian framework. Our approach integrates
closed-form moment propagation of random variables, Kalman Bayesian Neural
Networks, and Taylor approximations of the moments of softmax functions. By
explicitly accounting for pre-trained models as priors and adaptively balancing
them against new information based on quantified uncertainty, our method
achieves robust and data-efficient sequential learning. The effectiveness of
our method is demonstrated through numerical simulations involving sequential
adaptation of a decision transformer to tasks characterized by distribution
shifts and limited memory resources.

Motivation: 创业公司成功预测（通过收购或IPO退出）是创业和创新研究中的关键问题。现有方法要么只使用结构化数据准确率有限，要么LLM难以直接适应特定领域业务数据。

Method: 提出CrunchLLM框架，整合结构化公司属性和非结构化文本叙述，应用参数高效微调策略和提示优化，专门针对创业数据进行领域适应。

Abstract: Predicting the success of start-up companies, defined as achieving an exit
through acquisition or IPO, is a critical problem in entrepreneurship and
innovation research. Datasets such as Crunchbase provide both structured
information (e.g., funding rounds, industries, investor networks) and
unstructured text (e.g., company descriptions), but effectively leveraging this
heterogeneous data for prediction remains challenging. Traditional machine
learning approaches often rely only on structured features and achieve moderate
accuracy, while large language models (LLMs) offer rich reasoning abilities but
struggle to adapt directly to domain-specific business data. We present
\textbf{CrunchLLM}, a domain-adapted LLM framework for startup success
prediction. CrunchLLM integrates structured company attributes with
unstructured textual narratives and applies parameter-efficient fine-tuning
strategies alongside prompt optimization to specialize foundation models for
entrepreneurship data. Our approach achieves accuracy exceeding 80\% on
Crunchbase startup success prediction, significantly outperforming traditional
classifiers and baseline LLMs. Beyond predictive performance, CrunchLLM
provides interpretable reasoning traces that justify its predictions, enhancing
transparency and trustworthiness for financial and policy decision makers. This
work demonstrates how adapting LLMs with domain-aware fine-tuning and
structured--unstructured data fusion can advance predictive modeling of
entrepreneurial outcomes. CrunchLLM contributes a methodological framework and
a practical tool for data-driven decision making in venture capital and
innovation policy.

Conclusion: LLM融合方法可用于多模态时序应用，特别是在对齐训练数据有限的情况下，且无需额外的内存和计算资源

Abstract: Sensor data streams provide valuable information around activities and
context for downstream applications, though integrating complementary
information can be challenging. We show that large language models (LLMs) can
be used for late fusion for activity classification from audio and motion time
series data. We curated a subset of data for diverse activity recognition
across contexts (e.g., household activities, sports) from the Ego4D dataset.
Evaluated LLMs achieved 12-class zero- and one-shot classification F1-scores
significantly above chance, with no task-specific training. Zero-shot
classification via LLM-based fusion from modality-specific models can enable
multimodal temporal applications where there is limited aligned training data
for learning a shared embedding space. Additionally, LLM-based fusion can
enable model deploying without requiring additional memory and computation for
targeted application-specific multimodal models.

Abstract: Matched-pair experimental designs aim to detect treatment effects by pairing
participants and comparing within-pair outcome differences. In many situations,
the overall effect size is small across the entire population. Then, the focus
naturally shifts to identifying and targeting high treatment-effect regions
where the intervention is most effective. This paper proposes a matched-pair
experimental design that sequentially and actively enrolls patients in high
treatment-effect regions. Importantly, we frame the identification of the
target region as a classification problem and propose an active learning
framework tailored to matched-pair designs. The proposed design not only
reduces the experimental cost of detecting treatment efficacy, but also ensures
that the identified regions enclose the entire high-treatment-effect regions.
Our theoretical analysis of the framework's label complexity, along with
experiments in practical scenarios, demonstrates the efficiency and advantages
of the approach.

TL;DR: HalluField是一种基于场论和热力学的幻觉检测方法，通过分析LLM输出在不同温度下的能量和熵分布来量化语义稳定性，从而检测幻觉。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型经常产生不准确或不可靠的内容（幻觉），这限制了其在高风险应用中的部署，因此需要一种通用的幻觉检测方法。

Method: 基于参数化变分原理和热力学，将LLM对查询的响应建模为离散似然token路径集合，每个路径关联能量和熵，通过分析温度和似然变化下的能量熵分布来检测语义不稳定性。

Result: HalluField在计算上高效且实用，无需微调或辅助神经网络，直接在模型输出logits上操作，在多个模型和数据集上实现了最先进的幻觉检测性能。

Conclusion: 通过物理视角建模LLM行为，HalluField提供了一种基于热力学第一定律的有原则的幻觉检测方法，能够有效识别不稳定的幻觉内容。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit impressive reasoning and
question-answering capabilities. However, they often produce inaccurate or
unreliable content known as hallucinations. This unreliability significantly
limits their deployment in high-stakes applications. Thus, there is a growing
need for a general-purpose method to detect hallucinations in LLMs. In this
work, we introduce HalluField, a novel field-theoretic approach for
hallucination detection based on a parametrized variational principle and
thermodynamics. Inspired by thermodynamics, HalluField models an LLM's response
to a given query and temperature setting as a collection of discrete likelihood
token paths, each associated with a corresponding energy and entropy. By
analyzing how energy and entropy distributions vary across token paths under
changes in temperature and likelihood, HalluField quantifies the semantic
stability of a response. Hallucinations are then detected by identifying
unstable or erratic behavior in this energy landscape. HalluField is
computationally efficient and highly practical: it operates directly on the
model's output logits without requiring fine-tuning or auxiliary neural
networks. Notably, the method is grounded in a principled physical
interpretation, drawing analogies to the first law of thermodynamics.
Remarkably, by modeling LLM behavior through this physical lens, HalluField
achieves state-of-the-art hallucination detection performance across models and
datasets.

Abstract: Volunteer-based food rescue platforms tackle food waste by matching surplus
food to communities in need. These platforms face the dual problem of
maintaining volunteer engagement and maximizing the food rescued. Existing
algorithms to improve volunteer engagement exacerbate geographical disparities,
leaving some communities systematically disadvantaged. We address this issue by
proposing Contextual Budget Bandit. Contextual Budget Bandit incorporates
context-dependent budget allocation in restless multi-armed bandits, a model of
decision-making which allows for stateful arms. By doing so, we can allocate
higher budgets to communities with lower match rates, thereby alleviating
geographical disparities. To tackle this problem, we develop an empirically
fast heuristic algorithm. Because the heuristic algorithm can achieve a poor
approximation when active volunteers are scarce, we design the Mitosis
algorithm, which is guaranteed to compute the optimal budget allocation.
Empirically, we demonstrate that our algorithms outperform baselines on both
synthetic and real-world food rescue datasets, and show how our algorithm
achieves geographical fairness in food rescue.

TL;DR: GoldenTransformer是一个模块化、可扩展的故障注入框架，用于评估大型语言模型在硬件故障条件下的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管Transformer模型在各种领域取得了最先进的表现，但其在故障条件下的鲁棒性研究仍然不足，需要专门的工具来评估模型对硬件故障的弹性。

Method: 基于PyTorch和HuggingFace Transformers构建的统一Python平台，支持注入多种类型的故障（权重损坏、激活注入、注意力层干扰等），并考虑了大型Transformer架构的独特挑战。

Result: 框架支持实验可重复性、指标记录和可视化，并通过分类和生成任务的多个示例实验进行了验证。

Conclusion: GoldenTransformer为研究人员和从业者提供了宝贵的工具，用于模型鲁棒性分析和指导实际LLM应用中的可靠系统设计。

Abstract: Transformers have become the foundation for a wide range of
state--of--the--art models across natural language processing, computer vision,
and other machine learning domains. Despite their widespread deployment, the
robustness of these models under fault conditions remains underexplored. We
present GoldenTransformer, a modular and extensible fault injection framework
designed to evaluate the resiliency of Large Language Models to induced
hardware faults. GoldenTransformer offers a unified Python-based platform for
injecting diverse classes of faults--such as weight corruption, activation
injections, and attention--level disruptions--into pretrained
transformer--based models. Inspired by the GoldenEye simulator for DNNs, our
framework focuses on the unique challenges of working with large transformer
architectures, including considerations such as structural complexity, latent
dependencies, and nonuniform layer definitions. GoldenTransformer is built atop
PyTorch and HuggingFace Transformers, and it supports experiment
reproducibility, metric logging, and visualization out of the box. We detail
the technical design and use of GoldenTransformer and demonstrate through
several example experiments on classification and generation tasks. By enabling
controlled injection of faults at multiple logical and structural points in a
transformer, GoldenTransformer offers researchers and practitioners a valuable
tool for model robustness analysis and for guiding dependable system design in
real-world LLM applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的SAE去偏方法都假设特征表示存储在解码器权重中，但这个基本假设可能不准确。论文挖战这一假设，探索编码器权重在表示去偏中的关键作用。

Method: 提出S&P TopK框架：(i)重新定义SAE特征选择策略，(ii)通过向量正交化将输入嵌入与编码器权重分离，(iii)使用编码器权重插值保持去偏过程中的性能。

Result: 方法在公平性指标上超过传统SAE方法3.2倍，并将VLM测试时去偏的最佳结果提升了1.8倍，同时保持了下游任务性能。

Conclusion: 编码器权重在SAE表示去偏中具有重要作用，新提出的S&P TopK框架通过编码器中心方法显著改善了去偏效果，为可解释性AI提供了新的视角。

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have proven valuable due to their ability to
provide interpretable and steerable representations. Current debiasing methods
based on SAEs manipulate these sparse activations presuming that feature
representations are housed within decoder weights. We challenge this
fundamental assumption and introduce an encoder-focused alternative for
representation debiasing, contributing three key findings: (i) we highlight an
unconventional SAE feature selection strategy, (ii) we propose a novel SAE
debiasing methodology that orthogonalizes input embeddings against encoder
weights, and (iii) we establish a performance-preserving mechanism during
debiasing through encoder weight interpolation. Our Selection and Projection
framework, termed S\&P TopK, surpasses conventional SAE usage in fairness
metrics by a factor of up to 3.2 and advances state-of-the-art test-time VLM
debiasing results by a factor of up to 1.8 while maintaining downstream
performance.

TL;DR: FACTORS是一个结合实验设计与Shapley分解的框架，用于解决对训练因素组合敏感的性能和稳定性问题，通过风险调整目标函数在固定预算下可靠选择配置。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决机器学习模型性能对多种训练因素组合敏感的问题，传统方法难以在有限预算下同时考虑性能、稳定性和成本。

Method: 使用Shapley分解估计主效应和双因素交互作用，通过插件路径（条件均值）和最小二乘路径（样本重建）两种互补方法进行效应估计，包含标准化、偏差校正和不确定性量化。

Result: 在多样化数据集和设计条件下，提高了排名保持和最优配置识别能力，降低了决策风险，在预算约束下实现了可解释的稳定性能提升。

Conclusion: FACTORS框架提供了一种可解释的调优基础，能够在有限预算下可靠选择配置，同时提供性能增益和稳定性保证。

Abstract: We propose FACTORS, a framework that combines design of experiments with
Shapley decomposition to address performance and stability issues that are
sensitive to combinations of training factors. Our approach consistently
estimates main effects and two-factor interactions, then integrates them into a
risk-adjusted objective function that jointly accounts for uncertainty and
cost, enabling reliable selection of configurations under a fixed budget.
Effect estimation is implemented through two complementary paths: a plug-in
path based on conditional means, and a least-squares path that reconstructs
Shapley contributions from samples. These paths are designed to work
complementarily even when design density and bias levels differ. By
incorporating standardization of estimates, bias correction, and uncertainty
quantification, our procedure ensures comparability across heterogeneous factor
spaces and designs, while a lightweight search routine yields configurations
within practical time even for large factor spaces. On the theoretical side, we
provide error decompositions, sample complexity analysis, and upper bounds on
optimality gaps. On the interpretive side, we summarize main effects and
interactions in map form, highlighting adjustment priorities and safe
improvement pathways. Across diverse datasets and design conditions, our
approach improves rank preservation and optimal configuration identification,
reduces decision-making risks, and offers a tuning foundation that delivers
interpretable justification alongside stable performance gains even under
budget constraints.

Abstract: Generative learning has advanced network neuroscience, enabling tasks like
graph super-resolution, temporal graph prediction, and multimodal brain graph
fusion. However, current methods, mainly based on graph neural networks (GNNs),
focus solely on structural and topological properties, neglecting cognitive
traits. To address this, we introduce the first cognified generative model,
CogGNN, which endows GNNs with cognitive capabilities (e.g., visual memory) to
generate brain networks that preserve cognitive features. While broadly
applicable, we present CogGNN, a specific variant designed to integrate visual
input, a key factor in brain functions like pattern recognition and memory
recall. As a proof of concept, we use our model to learn connectional brain
templates (CBTs), population-level fingerprints from multi-view brain networks.
Unlike prior work that overlooks cognitive properties, CogGNN generates CBTs
that are both cognitively and structurally meaningful. Our contributions are:
(i) a novel cognition-aware generative model with a visual-memory-based loss;
(ii) a CBT-learning framework with a co-optimization strategy to yield
well-centered, discriminative, cognitively enhanced templates. Extensive
experiments show that CogGNN outperforms state-of-the-art methods, establishing
a strong foundation for cognitively grounded brain network modeling.

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种效果显著的图异常检测方法，通过创新的框架设计有效充分利用了局部和全局结构信息，同时抑制了异常节点的负面影响，为图数据异常检测领域提供了一个强大的新视角。

Abstract: Anomaly detection in graph-structured data is an inherently challenging
problem, as it requires the identification of rare nodes that deviate from the
majority in both their structural and behavioral characteristics. Existing
methods, such as those based on graph convolutional networks (GCNs), often
suffer from over-smoothing, which causes the learned node representations to
become indistinguishable. Furthermore, graph reconstruction-based approaches
are vulnerable to anomalous node interference during the reconstruction
process, leading to inaccurate anomaly detection. In this work, we propose a
novel and holistic anomaly evaluation framework that integrates three key
components: a local-global Transformer encoder, a memory-guided reconstruction
mechanism, and a multi-scale representation matching strategy. These components
work synergistically to enhance the model's ability to capture both local and
global structural dependencies, suppress the influence of anomalous nodes, and
assess anomalies from multiple levels of granularity. Anomaly scores are
computed by combining reconstruction errors and memory matching signals,
resulting in a more robust evaluation. Extensive experiments on seven benchmark
datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art
approaches, offering a comprehensive and generalizable solution for anomaly
detection across various graph domains.

Method: 使用基于保形鞅的检测器视角，同时学习消除分布偏移的特征并最小化任务特定损失的可微分目标函数

Result: 在概念偏移的数值实验和具有协变量偏移的模拟模仿学习环境中验证了方法的有效性

Conclusion: DRM提供了一种无需访问测试数据或域划分的分布外泛化新机制

Abstract: This paper proposes deception as a mechanism for out-of-distribution (OOD)
generalization: by learning data representations that make training data appear
independent and identically distributed (iid) to an observer, we can identify
stable features that eliminate spurious correlations and generalize to unseen
domains. We refer to this principle as deceptive risk minimization (DRM) and
instantiate it with a practical differentiable objective that simultaneously
learns features that eliminate distribution shifts from the perspective of a
detector based on conformal martingales while minimizing a task-specific loss.
In contrast to domain adaptation or prior invariant representation learning
methods, DRM does not require access to test data or a partitioning of training
data into a finite number of data-generating domains. We demonstrate the
efficacy of DRM on numerical experiments with concept shift and a simulated
imitation learning setting with covariate shift in environments that a robot is
deployed in.

Abstract: Strategies to improve the predicting performance of Message-Passing
Neural-Networks for molecular property predictions can be achieved by
simplifying how the message is passed and by using descriptors that capture
multiple aspects of molecular graphs. In this work, we designed model
architectures that achieved state-of-the-art performance, surpassing more
complex models such as those pre-trained on external databases. We assessed
dataset diversity to complement our performance results, finding that
structural diversity influences the need for additional components in our MPNNs
and feature sets.
  In most datasets, our best architecture employs bidirectional message-passing
with an attention mechanism, applied to a minimalist message formulation that
excludes self-perception, highlighting that relatively simpler models, compared
to classical MPNNs, yield higher class separability. In contrast, we found that
convolution normalization factors do not benefit the predictive power in all
the datasets tested. This was corroborated in both global and node-level
outputs. Additionally, we analyzed the influence of both adding spatial
features and working with 3D graphs, finding that 2D molecular graphs are
sufficient when complemented with appropriately chosen 3D descriptors. This
approach not only preserves predictive performance but also reduces
computational cost by over 50%, making it particularly advantageous for
high-throughput screening campaigns.

Conclusion: 通过针对去器添加噪声的对抑性训练，可以有效解决抛幻平滑中的半径偏移问题，实现更高的证书精度。

Abstract: Randomized smoothing is a well-established method for achieving certified
robustness against l2-adversarial perturbations. By incorporating a denoiser
before the base classifier, pretrained classifiers can be seamlessly integrated
into randomized smoothing without significant performance degradation. Among
existing methods, Diffusion Denoised Smoothing - where a pretrained denoising
diffusion model serves as the denoiser - has produced state-of-the-art results.
However, we show that employing a denoising diffusion model introduces a
covariate shift via misestimation of the added noise, ultimately degrading the
smoothed classifier's performance. To address this issue, we propose a novel
adversarial objective function focused on the added noise of the denoising
diffusion model. This approach is inspired by our understanding of the origin
of the covariate shift. Our goal is to train the base classifier to ensure it
is robust against the covariate shift introduced by the denoiser. Our method
significantly improves certified accuracy across three standard classification
benchmarks - MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet - achieving new state-of-the-art
performance in l2-adversarial perturbations. Our implementation is publicly

Motivation: 现有的token缩减方法（如ToMeSD和ToFu）虽然减少了FLOPs，但由于依赖GPU效率低下的操作（如排序、分散写入），在实际应用中无法实现理论上的加速效果

Method: 1) 将token合并重新表述为子模优化问题来选择多样化token；2) 通过GPU友好的矩阵运算实现类似注意力的线性变换；3) 利用潜在局部性和序列冗余性最小化开销

Result: ToMA将SDXL/Flux的生成延迟分别降低了24%/23%，同时保持图像质量（DINO Δ < 0.07），优于现有方法

Conclusion: 这项工作弥合了扩散模型中transformer理论效率与实际效率之间的差距，为高效图像生成提供了实用的解决方案

Abstract: Diffusion models excel in high-fidelity image generation but face scalability
limits due to transformers' quadratic attention complexity. Plug-and-play token
reduction methods like ToMeSD and ToFu reduce FLOPs by merging redundant tokens
in generated images but rely on GPU-inefficient operations (e.g., sorting,
scattered writes), introducing overheads that negate theoretical speedups when
paired with optimized attention implementations (e.g., FlashAttention). To
bridge this gap, we propose Token Merge with Attention (ToMA), an off-the-shelf
method that redesigns token reduction for GPU-aligned efficiency, with three
key contributions: 1) a reformulation of token merge as a submodular
optimization problem to select diverse tokens; 2) merge/unmerge as an
attention-like linear transformation via GPU-friendly matrix operations; and 3)
exploiting latent locality and sequential redundancy (pattern reuse) to
minimize overhead. ToMA reduces SDXL/Flux generation latency by 24%/23%,
respectively (with DINO $\Delta < 0.07$), outperforming prior methods. This
work bridges the gap between theoretical and practical efficiency for
transformers in diffusion.

Abstract: The impressive capabilities of deep learning models are often counterbalanced
by their inherent opacity, commonly termed the "black box" problem, which
impedes their widespread acceptance in high-trust domains. In response, the
intersecting disciplines of interpretability and explainability, collectively
falling under the Explainable AI (XAI) umbrella, have become focal points of
research. Although these terms are frequently used as synonyms, they carry
distinct conceptual weights. This document offers a comparative exploration of
interpretability and explainability within the deep learning paradigm,
carefully outlining their respective definitions, objectives, prevalent
methodologies, and inherent difficulties. Through illustrative examinations of
the MNIST digit classification task and IMDB sentiment analysis, we
substantiate a key argument: interpretability generally pertains to a model's
inherent capacity for human comprehension of its operational mechanisms (global
understanding), whereas explainability is more commonly associated with
post-hoc techniques designed to illuminate the basis for a model's individual
predictions or behaviors (local explanations). For example, feature attribution
methods can reveal why a specific MNIST image is recognized as a '7', and
word-level importance can clarify an IMDB sentiment outcome. However, these
local insights do not render the complex underlying model globally transparent.
A clear grasp of this differentiation, as demonstrated by these standard
datasets, is vital for fostering dependable and sound artificial intelligence.

Abstract: Background: Emerging reports of "AI psychosis" are on the rise, where
user-LLM interactions may exacerbate or induce psychosis or adverse
psychological symptoms. The sycophantic and agreeable nature of LLMs can
beneficial, it can become a vector for harm by reinforcing delusional beliefs
in vulnerable users.
  Methods: We introduce psychosis-bench, a novel benchmark designed to
systematically evaluate the psychogenicity of LLMs comprimising 16 structured,
12-turn conversational scenarios simulating the progression of delusional
themes(Erotic Delusions, Grandiose/Messianic Delusions, Referential Delusions)
and potential harms. We evaluated eight prominent LLMs for Delusion
Confirmation (DCS), Harm Enablement (HES), and Safety Intervention(SIS) across
explicit and implicit conversational contexts.
  Findings: Across 1,536 simulated conversation turns, all LLMs demonstrated
psychogenic potential, showing a strong tendency to perpetuate rather than
challenge delusions (mean DCS of 0.91 $\pm$0.88). Models frequently enabled
harmful user requests (mean HES of 0.69 $\pm$0.84) and offered safety
interventions in only roughly a third of applicable turns (mean SIS of 0.37
$\pm$0.48). 51 / 128 (39.8%) of scenarios had no safety interventions offered.
Performance was significantly worse in implicit scenarios, models were more
likely to confirm delusions and enable harm while offering fewer interventions
(p < .001). A strong correlation was found between DCS and HES (rs = .77).
Model performance varied widely, indicating that safety is not an emergent
property of scale alone.
  Conclusion: This study establishes LLM psychogenicity as a quantifiable risk
and underscores the urgent need for re-thinking how we train LLMs. We frame
this issue not merely as a technical challenge but as a public health
imperative requiring collaboration between developers, policymakers, and
healthcare professionals.

### [262] [PHLoRA: data-free Post-hoc Low-Rank Adapter extraction from full-rank checkpoint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10971)
*Bhoomit Vasani,Jack FitzGerald,Anjie Fang,Sushmit Vaish*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PHLoRA是一种从全参数微调模型中提取低秩适配器的方法，无需训练数据或梯度，通过权重差异的低秩分解来重建适配器模块


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法需要显式训练每个适配器的问题，实现从现有全参数模型或第三方检查点提取适配器，降低推理成本

Method: 计算基础模型与其微调版本之间权重差异的低秩分解，重建适配器模块，支持动态路由和合并

Result: 在文本、图像和视频基准测试中，提取的适配器保留了高能量，可安全剪枝，重新合并后下游任务性能下降可忽略

Conclusion: PHLoRA为所有现有全参数检查点提供适配器就绪的实用路径，实现了所有模型的可扩展推理民主化

Abstract: We introduce PHLoRA (Pronounced "flora"). (Post-hoc LoRA), a simple yet
powerful method to extract low-rank adaptation adapters from full-rank
fine-tuned models without requiring access to training data or gradients. By
computing the low-rank decomposition of weight differences between a base model
and its fine-tuned counterpart, our method reconstructs adapter modules that
can be merged or dynamically routed at inference time via S-LoRA, or served in
scalable, industry settings using platforms like NVIDIA NIM. This approach
amortizes latency overhead across requests and yields substantial cost savings.
Unlike prior work that trains each adapter explicitly, our approach decouples
fine-tuning from adapter generation, allowing adapter extraction from existing
full-rank models or third-party checkpoints. Experiments on text, image, and
video benchmarks using the Amazon Nova model family demonstrate that extracted
adapters preserve high energy from the full weight delta, can be pruned safely,
and yield negligible degradation in downstream task performance when re-merged.
Overall, PHLoRA provides a practical path for making all existing full-rank
checkpoints adapter-ready, democratizing scalable inference for all models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 通过在潜表示空间进行进化搜索找到多样化的表示解决方案，然后通过梯度回归训练网络近似这些表示，克服传统梯度下降在参数空间中搜索不可行的问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 梯度下降通常收敛到单一训练损失极小值，缺乏探索其他可能具有更好普通化性能的极小值的机制，而在高维参数空间直接搜索多样化极小值通常是不可行的

Method: 提出两阶段框架：在潜表示空间（中间激活值空间）进行搜索找到多样化的表示解决方案，然后通过梯度回归在参数空间训练网络近似这些被搜索到的表示

Result: 通过进化搜索发现的表示解决方案具有可学习性，在MNIST、CIFAR-10和CIFAR-100上近似SGD的性能，性能随着搜索计算量增加而提升直到饱和，产生的模型在训练过程中呈现与梯度下降不同的表示轨迹

Conclusion: 这项工作展示了未来训练算法如何通过将表示空间的搜索与参数空间的高效梯度基学习解耦来克服梯度下降在探索性方面的局限性

Abstract: Gradient descent typically converges to a single minimum of the training loss
without mechanisms to explore alternative minima that may generalize better.
Searching for diverse minima directly in high-dimensional parameter space is
generally intractable. To address this, we propose a framework that performs
training in two distinct phases: search in a tractable representation space
(the space of intermediate activations) to find diverse representational
solutions, and gradient-based learning in parameter space by regressing to
those searched representations. Through evolutionary search, we discover
representational solutions whose fitness and diversity scale with
compute--larger populations and more generations produce better and more varied
solutions. These representations prove to be learnable: networks trained by
regressing to searched representations approach SGD's performance on MNIST,
CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100. Performance improves with search compute up to
saturation. The resulting models differ qualitatively from networks trained
with gradient descent, following different representational trajectories during
training. This work demonstrates how future training algorithms could overcome
gradient descent's exploratory limitations by decoupling search in
representation space from efficient gradient-based learning in parameter space.

Motivation: 由于气候变化和生态系统破坏，全球野火对环境和人类生活的影响日益严重。现有解决方案主要关注火灾发生后的检测，而缺乏有效的预测技术。开发高精度预测模型需要大量数据集进行训练。

Method: 创建加州野火数据库(CAWFI)，收集2012-2018年每日历史野火数据，以及2012-2022年的指标数据，包括：领先指标（气象数据）、滞后指标（环境数据）和地质指标（植被和海拔数据）。

Conclusion: CAWFI数据集旨在推动野火预测研究和解决方案的发展，并为其他地区未来野火数据库的建立树立先例。

Abstract: Due to climate change and the disruption of ecosystems worldwide, wildfires
are increasingly impacting environment, infrastructure, and human lives
globally. Additionally, an exacerbating climate crisis means that these losses
would continue to grow if preventative measures are not implemented. Though
recent advancements in artificial intelligence enable wildfire management
techniques, most deployed solutions focus on detecting wildfires after
ignition. The development of predictive techniques with high accuracy requires
extensive datasets to train machine learning models. This paper presents the
California Wildfire Inventory (CAWFI), a wildfire database of over 37 million
data points for building and training wildfire prediction solutions, thereby
potentially preventing megafires and flash fires by addressing them before they
spark. The dataset compiles daily historical California wildfire data from 2012
to 2018 and indicator data from 2012 to 2022. The indicator data consists of
leading indicators (meteorological data correlating to wildfire-prone
conditions), trailing indicators (environmental data correlating to prior and
early wildfire activity), and geological indicators (vegetation and elevation
data dictating wildfire risk and spread patterns). CAWFI has already
demonstrated success when used to train a spatio-temporal artificial
intelligence model, predicting 85.7% of future wildfires larger than 300,000
acres when trained on 2012-2017 indicator data. This dataset is intended to
enable wildfire prediction research and solutions as well as set a precedent
for future wildfire databases in other regions.

TL;DR: FragmentGPT是一个基于GPT的分子片段连接框架，通过化学感知的预训练和奖励排名对齐算法，能够智能连接分子片段并解决结构冗余问题，优化多目标药物发现任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决片段药物发现中连接片段设计的挑战，特别是处理包含结构冗余（如重复环）的片段，传统方法无法通过简单添加或删除原子/键来解决这些问题。

Method: 整合两个核心组件：(1)化学感知的能量基键断裂预训练策略，使GPT模型具备片段生长、连接和合并能力；(2)奖励排名对齐与专家探索(RAE)算法，结合专家模仿学习、数据选择和增强，以及监督微调来对齐多目标策略。

Result: 在真实癌症数据集上的实验表明，FragmentGPT能够生成化学有效、高质量的分子，适用于下游药物发现任务。

Conclusion: FragmentGPT提供了一个统一的框架，能够智能连接分子片段并解决结构冗余问题，实现受控的目标驱动分子组装，为药物发现提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Fragment-Based Drug Discovery (FBDD) is a popular approach in early drug
development, but designing effective linkers to combine disconnected molecular
fragments into chemically and pharmacologically viable candidates remains
challenging. Further complexity arises when fragments contain structural
redundancies, like duplicate rings, which cannot be addressed by simply adding
or removing atoms or bonds. To address these challenges in a unified framework,
we introduce FragmentGPT, which integrates two core components: (1) a novel
chemically-aware, energy-based bond cleavage pre-training strategy that equips
the GPT-based model with fragment growing, linking, and merging capabilities,
and (2) a novel Reward Ranked Alignment with Expert Exploration (RAE) algorithm
that combines expert imitation learning for diversity enhancement, data
selection and augmentation for Pareto and composite score optimality, and
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to align the learner policy with multi-objective
goals. Conditioned on fragment pairs, FragmentGPT generates linkers that
connect diverse molecular subunits while simultaneously optimizing for multiple
pharmaceutical goals. It also learns to resolve structural redundancies-such as
duplicated fragments-through intelligent merging, enabling the synthesis of
optimized molecules. FragmentGPT facilitates controlled, goal-driven molecular
assembly. Experiments and ablation studies on real-world cancer datasets
demonstrate its ability to generate chemically valid, high-quality molecules
tailored for downstream drug discovery tasks.

TL;DR: 通过时间层分抽样策略，仅使用20%训练数据即可达到与全数据相似或更好的集成预测效果，解决深度学习模型在气候预测中的计算成本高问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归模型在集成天气预测中显示潜力但计算成本高，而气候科学数据稀缺且获取成本高，需要数据高效训练方法

Method: 探索多种数据抽样策略，采用简单的时间层分抽样方法进行数据选择

Result: 时间层分抽样在某些指标上超过全数据模型，其他指标也仅略微差于全数据模型，而仅需使用20%训练数据

Conclusion: 证明了数据高效扩散模型训练的可行性，为天气预测领域推动更高效的数据利用方法，应继续研究适应性或模型感知抽样方法

Abstract: Although numerical weather forecasting methods have dominated the field,
recent advances in deep learning methods, such as diffusion models, have shown
promise in ensemble weather forecasting. However, such models are typically
autoregressive and are thus computationally expensive. This is a challenge in
climate science, where data can be limited, costly, or difficult to work with.
In this work, we explore the impact of curated data selection on these
autoregressive diffusion models. We evaluate several data sampling strategies
and show that a simple time stratified sampling approach achieves performance
similar to or better than full-data training. Notably, it outperforms the
full-data model on certain metrics and performs only slightly worse on others
while using only 20% of the training data. Our results demonstrate the
feasibility of data-efficient diffusion training, especially for weather
forecasting, and motivates future work on adaptive or model-aware sampling
methods that go beyond random or purely temporal sampling.

Conclusion: DAC-FCF为有限数据条件下的轴承故障诊断提供了有前景的解决方案

Abstract: In the area of bearing fault diagnosis, deep learning (DL) methods have been
widely used recently. However, due to the high cost or privacy concerns,
high-quality labeled data are scarce in real world scenarios. While few-shot
learning has shown promise in addressing data scarcity, existing methods still
face significant limitations in this domain. Traditional data augmentation
techniques often suffer from mode collapse and generate low-quality samples
that fail to capture the diversity of bearing fault patterns. Moreover,
conventional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with local receptive fields
makes them inadequate for extracting global features from complex vibration
signals. Additionally, existing methods fail to model the intricate
relationships between limited training samples. To solve these problems, we
propose an advanced data augmentation and contrastive fourier convolution
framework (DAC-FCF) for bearing fault diagnosis under limited data. Firstly, a
novel conditional consistent latent representation and reconstruction
generative adversarial network (CCLR-GAN) is proposed to generate more diverse
data. Secondly, a contrastive learning based joint optimization mechanism is
utilized to better model the relations between the available training data.
Finally, we propose a 1D fourier convolution neural network (1D-FCNN) to
achieve a global-aware of the input data. Experiments demonstrate that DAC-FCF
achieves significant improvements, outperforming baselines by up to 32\% on
case western reserve university (CWRU) dataset and 10\% on a self-collected
test bench. Extensive ablation experiments prove the effectiveness of the
proposed components. Thus, the proposed DAC-FCF offers a promising solution for
bearing fault diagnosis under limited data.

hyperparameter optimization. This industry has seen significant growth of
E-commerce players in the recent years, wherein the business model majorly
relies on outsourcing Mattress manufacturing and related logistics and supply
chain operations, focusing on marketing the product and driving conversions
through Direct-to-Consumer sales channels. Now, within the United States, there

Conclusion: 该研究展示了图基空间学习与序列建模相结合的价值，为轨迹-用户链接问题提供了一种健壮可扩展的解决方案，在推荐系统、城市规划和安全领域具有应用潜力。

Abstract: Trajectory-user linking (TUL) aims to associate anonymized trajectories with
the users who generated them, which is crucial for personalized
recommendations, privacy-preserving analytics, and secure location-based
services. Existing methods struggle with sparse data, incomplete routes, and
limited modeling of complex spatial dependencies, often relying on low-level
check-in data or ignoring spatial patterns. In this paper, we introduced
GCN-TULHOR, a method that transforms raw location data into higher-order
mobility flow representations using hexagonal tessellation, reducing data
sparsity and capturing richer spatial semantics, and integrating Graph
Convolutional Networks (GCNs). Our approach converts both sparse check-in and
continuous GPS trajectory data into unified higher-order flow representations,
mitigating sparsity while capturing deeper semantic information. The GCN layer
explicitly models complex spatial relationships and non-local dependencies
without requiring side information such as timestamps or points of interest.
Experiments on six real-world datasets show consistent improvements over
classical baselines, RNN- and Transformer-based models, and the TULHOR method
in accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. GCN-TULHOR achieves 1-8% relative
gains in accuracy and F1. Sensitivity analysis identifies an optimal setup with
a single GCN layer and 512-dimensional embeddings. The integration of GCNs
enhances spatial learning and improves generalizability across mobility data.
This work highlights the value of combining graph-based spatial learning with
sequential modeling, offering a robust and scalable solution for TUL with
applications in recommendations, urban planning, and security.

Result: 同构图表示优于异构图；考虑30cm半径内的局部空间关系可提升性能；基于GAT的特征提取在迁移学习中表现最佳；相比非预训练模型平均F1分数提升72.7%

Conclusion: BIGNet能有效学习和迁移BIM设计特征，为未来设计和全生命周期管理的自动化应用提供了有力支持

Abstract: Large Foundation Models (LFMs) have demonstrated significant advantages in
civil engineering, but they primarily focus on textual and visual data,
overlooking the rich semantic, spatial, and topological features in BIM
(Building Information Modelling) models. Therefore, this study develops the
first large-scale graph neural network (GNN), BIGNet, to learn, and reuse
multidimensional design features embedded in BIM models. Firstly, a scalable
graph representation is introduced to encode the "semantic-spatial-topological"
features of BIM components, and a dataset with nearly 1 million nodes and 3.5
million edges is created. Subsequently, BIGNet is proposed by introducing a new
message-passing mechanism to GraphMAE2 and further pretrained with a node
masking strategy. Finally, BIGNet is evaluated in various transfer learning
tasks for BIM-based design checking. Results show that: 1) homogeneous graph
representation outperforms heterogeneous graph in learning design features, 2)
considering local spatial relationships in a 30 cm radius enhances performance,
and 3) BIGNet with GAT (Graph Attention Network)-based feature extraction
achieves the best transfer learning results. This innovation leads to a 72.7%
improvement in Average F1-score over non-pretrained models, demonstrating its
effectiveness in learning and transferring BIM design features and facilitating
their automated application in future design and lifecycle management.

Abstract: Persian names present unique challenges for natural language processing
applications, particularly in gender detection and digital identity creation,
due to transliteration inconsistencies and cultural-specific naming patterns.
Existing tools exhibit significant performance degradation on Persian names,

limitations. To address these challenges, the present research introduces
PNGT-26K, a comprehensive dataset of Persian names, their commonly associated
gender, and their English transliteration, consisting of approximately 26,000
tuples. As a demonstration of how this resource can be utilized, we also
introduce two frameworks, namely Open Gender Detection and Nominalist. Open
Gender Detection is a production-grade, ready-to-use framework for using
existing data from a user, such as profile photo and name, to give a
probabilistic guess about the person's gender. Nominalist, the second framework
introduced by this paper, utilizes agentic AI to help users choose a username

Result: 实验表明，将Hopkins损失集成到分类或降维任务中，对分类性能影响很小，同时提供了修改特征拓扑的好处。

Conclusion: Hopkins损失是一种有效的工具，能够在保持良好分类性能的同时，主动修改特征空间拓扑结构，为各种机器学习应用提供新的可能性。

Abstract: Feature space topology refers to the organization of samples within the
feature space. Modifying this topology can be beneficial in machine learning
applications, including dimensionality reduction, generative modeling, transfer
learning, and robustness to adversarial attacks. This paper introduces a novel
loss function, Hopkins loss, which leverages the Hopkins statistic to enforce a
desired feature space topology, which is in contrast to existing
topology-related methods that aim to preserve input feature topology. We
evaluate the effectiveness of Hopkins loss on speech, text, and image data in
two scenarios: classification and dimensionality reduction using nonlinear
bottleneck autoencoders. Our experiments show that integrating Hopkins loss
into classification or dimensionality reduction has only a small impact on
classification performance while providing the benefit of modifying feature
topology.

Motivation: 注意力机制的二次复杂度限制了LLM处理长上下文的能力，成为计算和内存的关键瓶颈，需要高效的近似解决方案

Method: 两阶段方法：离线SVD计算通用投影矩阵，在线推理时投影查询和键向量，基于查询幅度动态选择稀疏维度子集

Result: 在Llama-3.1-8B上实现25%注意力点积计算减少，在广泛基准测试中性能影响统计不显著，并能协同加速现有token淘汰方法

Conclusion: AQUA提供了可控的效率-精度平衡机制，是使大规模LLM推理更易获得和可持续的实用强大工具

Abstract: The quadratic complexity of the attention mechanism remains a fundamental
barrier to scaling Large Language Models (LLMs) to longer contexts, creating a
critical bottleneck in both computation and memory. To address this, we
introduce AQUA (Attention via QUery mAgnitudes) a novel and versatile
approximation strategy that significantly reduces the cost of attention with a
graceful performance trade-off. Our method operates in two phases: an efficient
offline step where we compute a universal, language agnostic projection matrix
via SVD on a calibration dataset, and an online inference step where we project
query and key vectors and dynamically select a sparse subset of dimensions
based on the query's magnitude. We provide a formal theoretical analysis of
AQUA, establishing the break-even point at which it becomes more
computationally efficient than standard attention. Our empirical evaluations on
state-of-the-art models like Llama-3.1-8B demonstrate that a 25% reduction in
the attention dot-product computation can be achieved with a statistically
insignificant impact on performance across a wide range of benchmarks. We
further showcase the versatility of AQUA by demonstrating its ability to
synergistically accelerate existing token eviction methods like H2O and to
directly reduce KV-cache memory size. By offering a controllable knob to
balance efficiency and accuracy, AQUA provides a practical and powerful tool
for making large-scale LLM inference more accessible and sustainable.

Result: 在MNIST、SVHN、CIFAR-10和CIFAR-100等流行基准图像数据集上的实验表明，MetaDFME优于当前最先进的无数据模型提取方法，同时在攻击过程中表现出更稳定的替代模型准确率。

Conclusion: MetaDFME通过元学习有效解决了无数据模型提取中的准确率振荡问题，提供了一种更稳定和实用的模型提取方法。

Abstract: Model extraction is a severe threat to Machine Learning-as-a-Service systems,
especially through data-free approaches, where dishonest users can replicate
the functionality of a black-box target model without access to realistic data.
Despite recent advancements, existing data-free model extraction methods suffer
from the oscillating accuracy of the substitute model. This oscillation, which
could be attributed to the constant shift in the generated data distribution
during the attack, makes the attack impractical since the optimal substitute
model cannot be determined without access to the target model's in-distribution
data. Hence, we propose MetaDFME, a novel data-free model extraction method
that employs meta-learning in the generator training to reduce the distribution
shift, aiming to mitigate the substitute model's accuracy oscillation. In
detail, we train our generator to iteratively capture the meta-representations
of the synthetic data during the attack. These meta-representations can be
adapted with a few steps to produce data that facilitates the substitute model
to learn from the target model while reducing the effect of distribution
shifts. Our experiments on popular baseline image datasets, MNIST, SVHN,
CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100, demonstrate that MetaDFME outperforms the current
state-of-the-art data-free model extraction method while exhibiting a more
stable substitute model's accuracy during the attack.

Motivation: 传统过采样技术（如SMOTE）在处理标签噪声和复杂数据分布时效果不佳，导致分类准确率下降，特别是在医疗诊断、欺诈检测等关键应用中

Method: 提出GK-SMOTE方法，使用高斯核密度估计区分安全区域和噪声区域，在高密度少数类区域生成合成样本，避免模糊区域，无需参数调优

Result: 在多个二分类数据集上的实验表明，GK-SMOTE在MCC、平衡准确率和AUPRC等关键指标上优于现有最先进的过采样技术

Conclusion: GK-SMOTE为不平衡分类任务提供了鲁棒高效的解决方案，特别适用于噪声数据环境，是现实应用的理想选择

Abstract: Imbalanced classification is a significant challenge in machine learning,
especially in critical applications like medical diagnosis, fraud detection,
and cybersecurity. Traditional oversampling techniques, such as SMOTE, often
fail to handle label noise and complex data distributions, leading to reduced
classification accuracy. In this paper, we propose GK-SMOTE, a
hyperparameter-free, noise-resilient extension of SMOTE, built on Gaussian
Kernel Density Estimation (KDE). GK-SMOTE enhances class separability by
generating synthetic samples in high-density minority regions, while
effectively avoiding noisy or ambiguous areas. This self-adaptive approach uses
Gaussian KDE to differentiate between safe and noisy regions, ensuring more
accurate sample generation without requiring extensive parameter tuning. Our
extensive experiments on diverse binary classification datasets demonstrate
that GK-SMOTE outperforms existing state-of-the-art oversampling techniques
across key evaluation metrics, including MCC, Balanced Accuracy, and AUPRC. The
proposed method offers a robust, efficient solution for imbalanced
classification tasks, especially in noisy data environments, making it an
attractive choice for real-world applications.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了OTA Merging和FFG方法，通过曲率意识的参数合并来提升多能力语言模型的合并效果，减少负载过，并保持了合并模型的稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在监督微调阶段多个能力基础的SFT检查点合并成单一模型时的参数干扰和负载过问题，提高合并模型的质量。

Method: 提出OTA Merging（优化轨迹感知合并），利用优化器二阶矩続统计作为曲率代理来重新加权参数编辑；以及FFG（快速Fisher探索），通过曲率驱动的任务局部化步骤稀疏化冲突或低重要性的编辑。

Result: 在多样化能力基础的SFT检查点上，OTA+FFG方法在合并模型质量上超过了强劲的权重空间基线，减少了负载过，并在不同稀疏度水平下保持了稳健性。

Conclusion: 该研究为为什么简单线性合并在实践中有效提供了新视角，并证明了FFG在减少任务干扰中的关键作用，同时压缩的二阶矩続保持了完整方案的收益。

Abstract: Model merging is an effective post-training strategy for composing
capabilities in large language models without joint retraining. We study this
in the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage, where multiple capability-based SFT
checkpoints -- spanning math, code, precise instruction following, general
instruction following, and knowledge recall -- must be consolidated into a
single model. We introduce Optimization Trajectory Aware (OTA) Merging, a
curvature-aware aggregation that leverages optimizer second-moment statistics
as a diagonal curvature proxy to reweight parameter edits and mitigate
interference. Complementing OTA, we propose Fast Fisher Grafting (FFG), a
curvature-driven task-localization step that sparsifies conflicting or
low-importance edits. FFG induces extremely low-rank masks concentrated in
early attention query/key projections and token embeddings, exploiting shared
curvature across capabilities. We further develop a memory-light compression of
the second moments that preserves OTA's effect. Across diverse capability-based
SFT checkpoints, OTA+FFG improves merged-model quality over strong weight-space
baselines, reduces negative transfer, and remains robust across sparsity
levels. Analyses reveal substantial curvature overlap between checkpoints,
offering a novel lens on why simple linear merging can be effective in
practice. Ablations confirm that FFG is critical for reducing task interference
and that the compressed second moments retain the gains of the full
formulation. To facilitate reproducibility, we open-source all code, training
and evaluation scripts, visualization artifacts, and capability-specific SFT
checkpoints at https://github.com/pmahdavi/ota-merge.

TL;DR: FedGDVE是一个联邦学习推荐系统，通过选择性整合全局数据来增强本地训练，解决了本地数据稀疏和偏差问题，性能提升达34.86%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联邦学习推荐系统仅依赖客户端私有数据，忽略了可用的公共数据集。虽然整合全局数据可以缓解本地数据稀疏和偏差问题，但简单合并会引入噪声和无关模式，影响个性化效果。

Method: 提出FedGDVE方法：1）使用预训练图编码器提取全局结构特征；2）本地有效性预测器评估客户端特定相关性；3）基于强化学习的概率估计器筛选和采样最相关的全局交互。

Result: 在联邦学习环境中，FedGDVE在公认基准测试中性能提升最高达34.86%。

Conclusion: FedGDVE通过选择性整合语义对齐的全局样本，有效解决了联邦学习推荐系统中本地数据稀疏和噪声问题，显著提升了推荐性能。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is gaining prominence in machine learning as privacy
concerns grow. This paradigm allows each client (e.g., an individual online
store) to train a recommendation model locally while sharing only model
updates, without exposing the raw interaction logs to a central server, thereby
preserving privacy in a decentralized environment. Nonetheless, most existing
FL-based recommender systems still rely solely on each client's private data,
despite the abundance of publicly available datasets that could be leveraged to
enrich local training; this potential remains largely underexplored. To this
end, we consider a realistic scenario wherein a large shopping platform
collaborates with multiple small online stores to build a global recommender
system. The platform possesses global data, such as shareable user and item
lists, while each store holds a portion of interaction data privately (or
locally). Although integrating global data can help mitigate the limitations of
sparse and biased clients' local data, it also introduces additional
challenges: simply combining all global interactions can amplify noise and
irrelevant patterns, worsening personalization and increasing computational
costs. To address these challenges, we propose FedGDVE, which selectively
augments each client's local graph with semantically aligned samples from the
global dataset. FedGDVE employs: (i) a pre-trained graph encoder to extract
global structural features, (ii) a local valid predictor to assess
client-specific relevance, (iii) a reinforcement-learning-based probability
estimator to filter and sample only the most pertinent global interactions.
FedGDVE improves performance by up to 34.86% on recognized benchmarks in FL
environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决最优决策树问题缺乏形式化规范和通用算法的问题，特别是对于具有灵活分裂规则的决策树

Method: 使用代数编程理论这一关系形式化方法，从形式化规范中构造性地推导出正确的动态规划算法，提出了四种新的ODT问题定义（三种尺寸约束，一种深度约束）

Result: 开发了四种新颖的最优算法，能够处理满足特定公理和目标函数形式的任意分裂规则，统一了已知的深度约束轴平行ODT算法

Conclusion: 该框架为通用ODT问题提供了优雅的解决方案，展示了灵活分裂规则决策树的巨大潜力，并且可扩展支持更灵活的决策树算法

Abstract: In the first paper (part I) of this series of two, we introduce four novel
definitions of the ODT problems: three for size-constrained trees and one for
depth-constrained trees. These definitions are stated unambiguously through
executable recursive programs, satisfying all criteria we propose for a formal
specification. In this sense, they resemble the "standard form" used in the
study of general-purpose solvers.
  Grounded in algebraic programming theory-a relational formalism for deriving
correct-by-construction algorithms from specifications-we can not only
establish the existence or nonexistence of dynamic programming solutions but
also derive them constructively whenever they exist. Consequently, the four
generic problem definitions yield four novel optimal algorithms for ODT
problems with arbitrary splitting rules that satisfy the axioms and objective
functions of a given form. These algorithms encompass the known
depth-constrained, axis-parallel ODT algorithm as the special case, while
providing a unified, efficient, and elegant solution for the general ODT
problem.
  In Part II, we present the first optimal hypersurface decision tree algorithm
and provide comprehensive experiments against axis-parallel decision tree
algorithms, including heuristic CART and state-of-the-art optimal methods. The
results demonstrate the significant potential of decision trees with flexible
splitting rules. Moreover, our framework is readily extendable to support
algorithms for constructing even more flexible decision trees, including those
with mixed splitting rules.

Motivation: 解决MuZero等基于MCTS的算法在树搜索过程中存在的顺序瓶颈问题，实现并行化的树构建以加速决策过程。

Method: 使用Transformer网络同时生成多个潜在未来状态，结合均值-方差约束评估器消除对顺序访问计数的依赖，实现整个子树的并行扩展。

Result: 在MiniGrid和LunarLander环境中，相比MuZero实现了最高11倍的wall-clock时间加速，同时保持了样本效率。

Conclusion: 并行树构建可以显著加速基于模型的强化学习，使复杂环境中的实时决策更接近实际应用。

Abstract: We present TransZero, a model-based reinforcement learning algorithm that
removes the sequential bottleneck in Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). Unlike
MuZero, which constructs its search tree step by step using a recurrent
dynamics model, TransZero employs a transformer-based network to generate
multiple latent future states simultaneously. Combined with the Mean-Variance
Constrained (MVC) evaluator that eliminates dependence on inherently sequential
visitation counts, our approach enables the parallel expansion of entire
subtrees during planning. Experiments in MiniGrid and LunarLander show that
TransZero achieves up to an eleven-fold speedup in wall-clock time compared to
MuZero while maintaining sample efficiency. These results demonstrate that
parallel tree construction can substantially accelerate model-based
reinforcement learning, bringing real-time decision-making in complex
environments closer to practice. The code is publicly available on GitHub.

TL;DR: 本文研究Hadamard流形上的在线黎曼优化，提出基于horospherical凸性(h-凸性)的新框架，相比传统测地凸性方法，获得了与流形曲率无关的遗憾界，达到与欧几里得空间相同的收敛速率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有在线黎曼优化方法主要依赖测地凸性(g-凸性)，导致遗憾界严重依赖于流形曲率，性能随曲率增大而恶化。需要开发曲率无关的优化框架。

Method: 提出基于horospherical凸性的黎曼在线梯度下降算法，分析h-凸函数和强h-凸函数的优化性能，理论证明其遗憾界。在SPD矩阵流形上进行实验验证，包括在线Tyler's M估计和在线Fréchet均值计算。

Result: 获得了O(√T)和O(log(T))的遗憾界，这些界与流形曲率无关，与欧几里得空间中的结果匹配。实验验证了h-凸性在实际应用中的有效性。

Conclusion: horospherical凸性为在线黎曼优化提供了曲率无关的理论保证，扩展了黎曼优化的应用范围，在SPD矩阵流形等实际场景中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: We study online Riemannian optimization on Hadamard manifolds under the
framework of horospherical convexity (h-convexity). Prior work mostly relies on
the geodesic convexity (g-convexity), leading to regret bounds scaling poorly
with the manifold curvature. To address this limitation, we analyze Riemannian
online gradient descent for h-convex and strongly h-convex functions and
establish $O(\sqrt{T})$ and $O(\log(T))$ regret guarantees, respectively. These
bounds are curvature-independent and match the results in the Euclidean
setting. We validate our approach with experiments on the manifold of symmetric
positive definite (SPD) matrices equipped with the affine-invariant metric. In
particular, we investigate online Tyler's $M$-estimation and online Fr\'echet
mean computation, showing the application of h-convexity in practice.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TabPFN RL是一种无梯度深度强化学习框架，使用预训练transformer TabPFN作为Q函数近似器，通过上下文学习进行推理，无需反向传播，在经典控制任务中表现优于或匹配DQN。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于梯度的优化在深度强化学习中存在超参数敏感、训练不稳定和计算成本高的问题，需要寻找无梯度的替代方案。

Method: 将原本用于表格分类的TabPFN transformer重新用于Q值预测，通过设计高奖励轨迹门控机制（保留前5%轨迹）来处理固定上下文预算限制。

Result: 在Gymnasium经典控制套件（CartPole v1、MountainCar v0、Acrobot v1）上，TabPFN RL匹配或超越了Deep Q Network的性能，且无需梯度下降或大量超参数调优。

Conclusion: TabPFN等先验拟合网络为快速计算高效的RL提供了可行基础，为使用大型预训练transformer进行无梯度RL开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Gradient based optimization is fundamental to most modern deep reinforcement
learning algorithms, however, it introduces significant sensitivity to
hyperparameters, unstable training dynamics, and high computational costs. We
propose TabPFN RL, a novel gradient free deep RL framework that repurposes the
meta trained transformer TabPFN as a Q function approximator. Originally
developed for tabular classification, TabPFN is a transformer pre trained on
millions of synthetic datasets to perform inference on new unseen datasets via
in context learning. Given an in context dataset of sample label pairs and new
unlabeled data, it predicts the most likely labels in a single forward pass,
without gradient updates or task specific fine tuning. We use TabPFN to predict
Q values using inference only, thereby eliminating the need for back
propagation at both training and inference. To cope with the model's fixed
context budget, we design a high reward episode gate that retains only the top
5% of trajectories. Empirical evaluations on the Gymnasium classic control
suite demonstrate that TabPFN RL matches or surpasses Deep Q Network on
CartPole v1, MountainCar v0, and Acrobot v1, without applying gradient descent
or any extensive hyperparameter tuning. We discuss the theoretical aspects of
how bootstrapped targets and non stationary visitation distributions violate
the independence assumptions encoded in TabPFN's prior, yet the model retains a
surprising generalization capacity. We further formalize the intrinsic context
size limit of in context RL algorithms and propose principled truncation
strategies that enable continual learning when the context is full. Our results
establish prior fitted networks such as TabPFN as a viable foundation for fast
and computationally efficient RL, opening new directions for gradient free RL
with large pre trained transformers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络容易记忆噪声标签，严重降低泛化性能。现有的Mixup方法缺乏样本选择和混合策略的原则性指导，无意中传播了噪声监督。

Method: 使用K折交叉验证进行置信度不匹配分析识别噪声样本，选择性地将不确定样本与置信样本混合，采用软标签表示混合样本的真实组成。

Result: 在多个合成和真实世界基准数据集上的实验表明，SelectMix始终优于强基线方法，验证了其在噪声标签学习中的有效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: SelectMix通过置信度引导的选择性混合和软标签策略，有效解决了噪声标签问题，提高了模型的泛化性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Deep neural networks tend to memorize noisy labels, severely degrading their
generalization performance. Although Mixup has demonstrated effectiveness in
improving generalization and robustness, existing Mixup-based methods typically
perform indiscriminate mixing without principled guidance on sample selection
and mixing strategy, inadvertently propagating noisy supervision. To overcome
these limitations, we propose SelectMix, a confidence-guided mixing framework
explicitly tailored for noisy labels. SelectMix first identifies potentially
noisy or ambiguous samples through confidence based mismatch analysis using
K-fold cross-validation, then selectively blends identified uncertain samples
with confidently predicted peers from their potential classes. Furthermore,
SelectMix employs soft labels derived from all classes involved in the mixing
process, ensuring the labels accurately represent the composition of the mixed
samples, thus aligning supervision signals closely with the actual mixed
inputs. Through extensive theoretical analysis and empirical evaluations on
multiple synthetic (MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100) and real-world
benchmark datasets (CIFAR-N, MNIST and Clothing1M), we demonstrate that
SelectMix consistently outperforms strong baseline methods, validating its
effectiveness and robustness in learning with noisy labels.

TL;DR: PINGS是一个基于物理信息神经网络的快速生成采样框架，通过单次前向传播实现扩散采样，在保持目标分布结构的同时实现恒定时间生成。


<details>

Motivation: 为了解决传统扩散模型采样需要多次迭代计算（高NFE）导致速度慢的问题，开发一个能够通过单次前向传播实现高质量采样的方法。

Method: 使用物理信息神经网络（PINN）来近似反向时间概率流动力学，训练一个从3D标准正态分布到非高斯混合模型的直接映射，采用端点锚定的PINN风格残差问题框架。

Result: 在RTX 3090上生成10^4个样本仅需16.54±0.56毫秒，相比DPM-Solver（468-843毫秒）和DDIM（960毫秒）显著更快，同时保持了目标分布的结构特性（MMD²=1.88×10⁻²）。

Conclusion: PINGS作为一个概念验证，展示了通过PINN方法实现快速、基于函数的生成采样的潜力，有望扩展到科学模拟等领域。

Abstract: We introduce PINGS (Physics-Informed Neural Network for Fast Generative
Sampling), a framework that amortizes diffusion sampling by training a
physics-informed network to approximate reverse-time probability-flow dynamics,
reducing sampling to a single forward pass (NFE = 1). As a proof of concept, we
learn a direct map from a 3D standard normal to a non-Gaussian Gaussian Mixture
Model (GMM). PINGS preserves the target's distributional structure
(multi-bandwidth kernel $MMD^2 = 1.88 \times 10^{-2}$ with small errors in
mean, covariance, skewness, and excess kurtosis) and achieves constant-time
generation: $10^4$ samples in $16.54 \pm 0.56$ millisecond on an RTX 3090,
versus 468-843 millisecond for DPM-Solver (10/20) and 960 millisecond for DDIM
(50) under matched conditions. We also sanity-check the
PINN/automatic-differentiation pipeline on a damped harmonic oscillator,
obtaining MSEs down to $\mathcal{O}(10^{-5})$. Compared to fast but iterative
ODE solvers and direct-map families (Flow, Rectified-Flow, Consistency), PINGS
frames generative sampling as a PINN-style residual problem with endpoint
anchoring, yielding a white-box, differentiable map with NFE = 1. These
proof-of-concept results position PINGS as a promising route to fast,
function-based generative sampling with potential extensions to scientific
simulation (e.g., fast calorimetry).

Motivation: 解决增量学习中的灾难性遗忘问题，特别是在资源受限环境下，现有方法计算成本高且训练过程复杂。

Conclusion: CIFNet使类增量学习在资源有限环境中更加实用可行，特别是在有强预训练特征提取器可用时。

Abstract: Incremental learning remains a critical challenge in machine learning, as
models often struggle with catastrophic forgetting -the tendency to lose
previously acquired knowledge when learning new information. These challenges
are even more pronounced in resource-limited settings. Many existing Class
Incremental Learning (CIL) methods achieve high accuracy by continually
adapting their feature representations; however, they often require substantial
computational resources and complex, iterative training procedures. This work
introduces CIFNet (Class Incremental and Frugal Network), a novel CIL approach
that addresses these limitations by offering a highly efficient and sustainable
solution. CIFNet's key innovation lies in its novel integration of several
existing, yet separately explored, components: a pre-trained and frozen feature
extractor, a compressed data buffer, and an efficient non-iterative one-layer
neural network for classification. A pre-trained and frozen feature extractor
eliminates computationally expensive fine-tuning of the backbone. This,
combined with a compressed buffer for efficient memory use, enables CIFNet to
perform efficient class-incremental learning through a single-step optimization
process on fixed features, minimizing computational overhead and training time
without requiring multiple weight updates. Experiments on benchmark datasets
confirm that CIFNet effectively mitigates catastrophic forgetting at the
classifier level, achieving high accuracy comparable to that of existing
state-of-the-art methods, while substantially improving training efficiency and
sustainability. CIFNet represents a significant advancement in making
class-incremental learning more accessible and pragmatic in environments with
limited resources, especially when strong pre-trained feature extractors are
available.

Motivation: 为了解决RLHF方法缺乏统一数学框架和可还原性分析的问题，建立标准化的表示和转换机制。

Method: 采用算子视图将RLHF目标分解为加法惩罚和乘法权重阶梯，提出GKPO规范模式，包含JSON序列化、规范化和哈希规则。

Result: 证明了在固定参考、加法惩罚和权重独立条件下可还原到成对边际，否则不可还原。实现了DPO、RRHF、ORPO等方法的GKPO表示和转换。

Conclusion: Opal框架为RLHF提供了统一的数学基础和标准化表示，GKPO模式支持方法间的转换和可还原性验证，有助于RLHF方法的系统化分析和比较。

Abstract: We present Opal, an operator view of reinforcement learning from human
feedback (RLHF). Objectives are expressed as ladders of two primitives on a
base utility: additive penalties and multiplicative pairwise weights. We
describe a simple reduction law with if-and-only-if conditions: such ladders
collapse to a normal form on pairwise margins when the reference is fixed,
penalties are additive, and weights are independent of intermediate margins.
When these assumptions do not hold (reference shift, non-additive gates,
score-dependent weights), small examples demonstrate non-reducibility.
  Building on this view, we introduce GKPO (Generalized Kernel Preference
Object), a canonical schema in which many RLHF methods can be represented and,
when reducible, mapped back from. GKPO provides a standard JSON serialization,
canonicalization and hashing rules, and explicit flags with finite witnesses
when assumptions fail.
  We illustrate these ideas with GKPO examples for DPO, RRHF, and ORPO, along
with cross-method conversions (where assumptions permit) and minimal stress
tests (SHIFT/GATE/SCORE) that highlight non-reducibility. A lightweight Python
reference library accompanies the schema, implementing canonical hashing and
adapters for DPO and RRHF.

advanced multi-modal AI models (e.g., GPT-4.1, Claude 4, Gemini 2.5, and Doubao

strong potential for applications in materials characterization and analysis.

### [289] [On the Escaping Efficiency of Distributed Adversarial Training Algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11337)
*Ying Cao,Kun Yuan,Ali H. Sayed*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文比较了分布式对抗训练算法（集中式与去中心化策略），理论分析显示在小扰动和大批量情况下，去中心化算法能更快逃离局部极小值，获得更平坦的最小值，从而提升模型鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究分布式对抗训练算法在多智能体学习环境中的性能差异，特别是关注模型平坦度对鲁棒性的影响，为分布式环境下的模型鲁棒性提升提供理论指导。

Method: 建立理论框架分析算法逃离局部极小值的效率，比较集中式和去中心化（共识和扩散）策略，通过仿真验证理论发现。

Result: 当扰动边界较小且使用大批量时，去中心化算法比集中式策略更快逃离局部极小值，获得更平坦的最小值；但随着扰动增加，此优势可能消失。

Conclusion: 去中心化策略在分布式环境中具有提升模型鲁棒性的潜力，特别是在适度攻击强度和大批量训练条件下。

Abstract: Adversarial training has been widely studied in recent years due to its role
in improving model robustness against adversarial attacks. This paper focuses
on comparing different distributed adversarial training algorithms--including
centralized and decentralized strategies--within multi-agent learning
environments. Previous studies have highlighted the importance of model
flatness in determining robustness. To this end, we develop a general
theoretical framework to study the escaping efficiency of these algorithms from
local minima, which is closely related to the flatness of the resulting models.
We show that when the perturbation bound is sufficiently small (i.e., when the
attack strength is relatively mild) and a large batch size is used,
decentralized adversarial training algorithms--including consensus and
diffusion--are guaranteed to escape faster from local minima than the
centralized strategy, thereby favoring flatter minima. However, as the
perturbation bound increases, this trend may no longer hold. In the simulation
results, we illustrate our theoretical findings and systematically compare the
performance of models obtained through decentralized and centralized
adversarial training algorithms. The results highlight the potential of
decentralized strategies to enhance the robustness of models in distributed
settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动物传播的传染痆病对人类极具危害，快速准确预测病毒宿主来源可以有效防止疾病传播

Method: 使用双向长短期记忆网络(BiLSTM)构建VHP模型，处理400个基因长度的核酸序列

Result: 模型在三种病毒上取得高准确率：汉坦病毒89.62%、轮状痆毒96.58%、糊狄病毒77.22%，超过以往研究

Conclusion: BiLSTM-VHP是一种高效的宿主预测方法，为预防动物传播疾病提供了可靠的技术支持

Abstract: Recorded history shows the long coexistence of humans and animals, suggesting
it began much earlier. Despite some beneficial interdependence, many animals
carry viral diseases that can spread to humans. These diseases are known as
zoonotic diseases. Recent outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2, Monkeypox and swine flu
viruses have shown how these viruses can disrupt human life and cause death.
Fast and accurate predictions of the host from which the virus spreads can help
prevent these diseases from spreading. This work presents BiLSTM-VHP, a
lightweight bidirectional long short-term memory (LSTM)-based architecture that
can predict the host from the nucleotide sequence of orthohantavirus, rabies
lyssavirus, and rotavirus A with high accuracy. The proposed model works with
nucleotide sequences of 400 bases in length and achieved a prediction accuracy
of 89.62% for orthohantavirus, 96.58% for rotavirus A, and 77.22% for rabies
lyssavirus outperforming previous studies. Moreover, performance of the model
is assessed using the confusion matrix, F-1 score, precision, recall,
microaverage AUC. In addition, we introduce three curated datasets of
orthohantavirus, rotavirus A, and rabies lyssavirus containing 8,575, 95,197,
and 22,052 nucleotide sequences divided into 9, 12, and 29 host classes,
respectively. The codes and dataset are available at

TL;DR: 本文研究了混合专家模型中的线性模式连接现象，发现独立训练的MoE模型可以通过参数空间中的线性路径连接，且损失保持较低水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 线性模式连接现象挑战了传统非凸优化的观点，对模型集成、泛化和神经网络损失几何理解具有重要意义。受标准神经网络中LMC研究的启发，本文系统研究MoE架构中的这一现象。

Method: 首先全面分析稠密和稀疏门控机制，证明MoE架构的对称性完全由专家组件和门控函数的排列表征。基于此提出匹配算法，使独立训练的MoE能够对齐，从而发现LMC。

Result: 在不同MoE配置（稠密、稀疏、共享专家变体）、多种模型设置和不同规模/模态的数据集上，通过提出的算法实证验证了LMC的存在。

Conclusion: 结果证实了MoE架构中存在线性模式连接，为深度学习模型的功能景观和优化动力学提供了基础性见解。

Abstract: Linear Mode Connectivity (LMC) is a notable phenomenon in the loss landscapes
of neural networks, wherein independently trained models have been observed to
be connected--up to permutation symmetries--by linear paths in parameter space
along which the loss remains consistently low. This observation challenges
classical views of non-convex optimization and has implications for model
ensembling, generalization, and our understanding of neural loss geometry.
Inspired by recent studies on LMC in standard neural networks, we
systematically investigate this phenomenon within Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
architectures--a class of models known for their scalability and computational
efficiency, which combine traditional neural networks--referred to as
experts--through a learnable gating mechanism. We begin by conducting a
comprehensive analysis of both dense and sparse gating regimes, demonstrating
that the symmetries inherent to MoE architectures are fully characterized by
permutations acting on both the expert components and the gating function.
Building on these foundational findings, we propose a matching algorithm that
enables alignment between independently trained MoEs, thereby facilitating the
discovery of LMC. Finally, we empirically validate the presence of LMC using
our proposed algorithm across diverse MoE configurations--including dense,
sparse, and shared-expert variants--under a wide range of model settings and
datasets of varying scales and modalities. Our results confirm the existence of
LMC in MoE architectures and offer fundamental insights into the functional
landscape and optimization dynamics of deep learning models.

Motivation: 解决下游智能体在具有不同效用函数和约束函数的情况下，如何通过共享预测信息同时保证低后悔值和约束满足的问题

Method: 设计在线全预测框架，生成单一预测集供下游智能体使用，智能体根据预测选择行动，保证后悔值和累积约束违反的边界

Conclusion: 该方法为具有异质约束的多智能体系统提供了有效的在线预测解决方案，具有良好的理论保证和实际应用价值

Abstract: We introduce and study the problem of online omniprediction with long-term
constraints. At each round, a forecaster is tasked with generating predictions
for an underlying (adaptively, adversarially chosen) state that are broadcast
to a collection of downstream agents, who must each choose an action. Each of
the downstream agents has both a utility function mapping actions and state to
utilities, and a vector-valued constraint function mapping actions and states
to vector-valued costs. The utility and constraint functions can arbitrarily
differ across downstream agents. Their goal is to choose actions that guarantee
themselves no regret while simultaneously guaranteeing that they do not
cumulatively violate the constraints across time. We show how to make a single
set of predictions so that each of the downstream agents can guarantee this by
acting as a simple function of the predictions, guaranteeing each of them
$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret and $O(1)$ cumulative constraint violation. We
also show how to extend our guarantees to arbitrary intersecting contextually
defined \emph{subsequences}, guaranteeing each agent both regret and constraint
violation bounds not just marginally, but simultaneously on each subsequence,
against a benchmark set of actions simultaneously tailored to each subsequence.

TL;DR: PersonaX是一个多模态数据集，包含CelebPersona（9444位公众人物）和AthlePersona（4181位运动员），整合了行为特征评估、面部图像和传记信息，用于多模态特征分析和因果推理研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有资源很少提供结合行为描述符与面部属性和传记信息的多模态数据集，限制了人类行为特征的全面分析。

Method: 1) 使用三个高性能大语言模型推断行为特征评估；2) 应用五种统计独立性检验分析模态间关系；3) 提出针对多模态和多测量数据的因果表示学习框架。

Result: 在合成和真实数据上的实验证明了该方法的有效性，建立了研究LLM推断行为特征与视觉、传记属性结合的基础。

Conclusion: PersonaX通过统一结构化和非结构化分析，为多模态特征分析和因果推理研究奠定了基础，推动了该领域的发展。

Abstract: Understanding human behavior traits is central to applications in
human-computer interaction, computational social science, and personalized AI
systems. Such understanding often requires integrating multiple modalities to
capture nuanced patterns and relationships. However, existing resources rarely
provide datasets that combine behavioral descriptors with complementary
modalities such as facial attributes and biographical information. To address
this gap, we present PersonaX, a curated collection of multimodal datasets
designed to enable comprehensive analysis of public traits across modalities.
PersonaX consists of (1) CelebPersona, featuring 9444 public figures from
diverse occupations, and (2) AthlePersona, covering 4181 professional athletes
across 7 major sports leagues. Each dataset includes behavioral trait
assessments inferred by three high-performing large language models, alongside
facial imagery and structured biographical features. We analyze PersonaX at two
complementary levels. First, we abstract high-level trait scores from text
descriptions and apply five statistical independence tests to examine their
relationships with other modalities. Second, we introduce a novel causal
representation learning (CRL) framework tailored to multimodal and
multi-measurement data, providing theoretical identifiability guarantees.
Experiments on both synthetic and real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness
of our approach. By unifying structured and unstructured analysis, PersonaX
establishes a foundation for studying LLM-inferred behavioral traits in
conjunction with visual and biographical attributes, advancing multimodal trait
analysis and causal reasoning.

Motivation: 实际应用中（如医疗健康、机器人学、金融领域）的环境动态可能会演化，导致过渡概率或奖励函数发生变化，传统RL模型偏移检测方法面临挑战。

Method: 提出了一套基于编辑操作的测量方法，用于量化稳态条件下与干扰条件下产生的状态-动作轨迹之间的偏移程度。

Result: 实验结果表明，这些测量方法能够有效区分已发生偏移和未发生偏移的场景，甚至在不同噪声水平下也能保持良好性能。

Conclusion: 该框架为非稳态RL环境中的模型偏移检测提供了一种实用的工具，能够及早发现环境变化并采取相应措施。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) agents typically assume stationary environment
dynamics. Yet in real-world applications such as healthcare, robotics, and
finance, transition probabilities or reward functions may evolve, leading to
model drift. This paper proposes a novel framework to detect such drifts by
analyzing the distributional changes in sequences of agent behavior.
Specifically, we introduce a suite of edit operation-based measures to quantify
deviations between state-action trajectories generated under stationary and
perturbed conditions. Our experiments demonstrate that these measures can
effectively distinguish drifted from non-drifted scenarios, even under varying
levels of noise, providing a practical tool for drift detection in
non-stationary RL environments.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), AI-driven music
generation has become a vibrant and fruitful area of research. However, the
representation of musical data remains a significant challenge. To address
this, a novel, machine-learning-friendly music notation system, YNote, was
developed. This study leverages YNote to train an effective classification
model capable of distinguishing whether a piece of music was composed by a
human (Native), a rule-based algorithm (Algorithm Generated), or an LLM (LLM
Generated). We frame this as a text classification problem, applying the Term
Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) algorithm to extract structural
features from YNote sequences and using the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling
Technique (SMOTE) to address data imbalance. The resulting model achieves an
accuracy of 98.25%, successfully demonstrating that YNote retains sufficient
stylistic information for analysis. More importantly, the model can identify
the unique " technological fingerprints " left by different AI generation
techniques, providing a powerful tool for tracing the origins of AI-generated
content.

real-time decision support. This study presents a novel integrated framework
combining state-of-the-art large language models (GPT-4o, Claude 4 Sonnet,

Few-shot learning reduces field adaptation time by 72%, while automated prompt

Abstract: Predicting default is essential for banks to ensure profitability and
financial stability. While modern machine learning methods often outperform
traditional regression techniques, their lack of transparency limits their use
in regulated environments. Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has
emerged as a solution in domains like credit scoring. However, most XAI
research focuses on post-hoc interpretation of black-box models, which does not
produce models lightweight or transparent enough to meet regulatory
requirements, such as those for Internal Ratings-Based (IRB) models.
  This paper proposes a hybrid approach: post-hoc interpretations of black-box
models guide feature selection, followed by training glass-box models that
maintain both predictive power and transparency.
  Using the Lending Club dataset, we demonstrate that this approach achieves
performance comparable to a benchmark black-box model while using only 10
features - an 88.5% reduction. In our example, SHapley Additive exPlanations
(SHAP) is used for feature selection, eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)
serves as the benchmark and the base black-box model, and Explainable Boosting
Machine (EBM) and Penalized Logistic Tree Regression (PLTR) are the
investigated glass-box models.
  We also show that model refinement using feature interaction analysis,
correlation checks, and expert input can further enhance model interpretability
and robustness.

Abstract: A red team simulates adversary attacks to help defenders find effective
strategies to defend their systems in a real-world operational setting. As more
enterprise systems adopt AI, red-teaming will need to evolve to address the
unique vulnerabilities and risks posed by AI systems. We take the position that
AI systems can be more effectively red-teamed if AI red-teaming is recognized
as a domain-specific evolution of cyber red-teaming. Specifically, we argue
that existing Cyber Red Teams who adopt this framing will be able to better
evaluate systems with AI components by recognizing that AI poses new risks, has
new failure modes to exploit, and often contains unpatchable bugs that
re-prioritize disclosure and mitigation strategies. Similarly, adopting a
cybersecurity framing will allow existing AI Red Teams to leverage a
well-tested structure to emulate realistic adversaries, promote mutual
accountability with formal rules of engagement, and provide a pattern to mature
the tooling necessary for repeatable, scalable engagements. In these ways, the
merging of AI and Cyber Red Teams will create a robust security ecosystem and
best position the community to adapt to the rapidly changing threat landscape.

Abstract: Existing AI system benchmarks such as MLPerf often struggle to keep pace with
the rapidly evolving AI landscape, making it difficult to support informed
deployment, optimization, and co-design decisions for AI systems. We suggest
that benchmarking itself can be framed as an AI task - one in which models are
continuously evaluated and optimized across diverse datasets, software, and
hardware, using key metrics such as accuracy, latency, throughput, energy
consumption, and cost. To support this perspective, we present FlexBench: a
modular extension of the MLPerf LLM inference benchmark, integrated with
HuggingFace and designed to provide relevant and actionable insights.
Benchmarking results and metadata are collected into an Open MLPerf Dataset,
which can be collaboratively curated, extended, and leveraged for predictive
modeling and feature engineering. We successfully validated the FlexBench
concept through MLPerf Inference submissions, including evaluations of DeepSeek
R1 and LLaMA 3.3 on commodity servers. The broader objective is to enable
practitioners to make cost-effective AI deployment decisions that reflect their
available resources, requirements, and constraints.

Conclusion: 该方法提供了分析梯度下降动态的通用理论框架，揭示了隐式正则化效应的普遍性，并为超参数调优等实际任务提供了低成本统计有效工具。

Abstract: This paper develops a general approach to characterize the long-time
trajectory behavior of nonconvex gradient descent in generalized single-index
models in the large aspect ratio regime. In this regime, we show that for each
iteration the gradient descent iterate concentrates around a deterministic
vector called the `Gaussian theoretical gradient descent', whose dynamics can
be tracked by a state evolution system of two recursive equations for two
scalars. Our concentration guarantees hold universally for a broad class of
design matrices and remain valid over long time horizons until algorithmic
convergence or divergence occurs. Moreover, our approach reveals that gradient
descent iterates are in general approximately independent of the data and
strongly incoherent with the feature vectors, a phenomenon previously known as
the `implicit regularization' effect of gradient descent in specific models
under Gaussian data.
  As an illustration of the utility of our general theory, we present two
applications of different natures in the regression setting. In the first, we
prove global convergence of nonconvex gradient descent with general independent
initialization for a broad class of structured link functions, and establish
universality of randomly initialized gradient descent in phase retrieval for
large aspect ratios. In the second, we develop a data-free iterative algorithm
for estimating state evolution parameters along the entire gradient descent
trajectory, thereby providing a low-cost yet statistically valid tool for
practical tasks such as hyperparameter tuning and runtime determination.
  As a by-product of our analysis, we show that in the large aspect ratio
regime, the Gaussian theoretical gradient descent coincides with a recent line
of dynamical mean-field theory for gradient descent over the constant-time
horizon.

Abstract: This study presents a deep tabular learning framework for predicting crash
severity in electric vehicle (EV) collisions using real-world crash data from
Texas (2017-2023). After filtering for electric-only vehicles, 23,301
EV-involved crash records were analyzed. Feature importance techniques using
XGBoost and Random Forest identified intersection relation, first harmful
event, person age, crash speed limit, and day of week as the top predictors,
along with advanced safety features like automatic emergency braking. To
address class imbalance, Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique and Edited
Nearest Neighbors (SMOTEENN) resampling was applied. Three state-of-the-art
deep tabular models, TabPFN, MambaNet, and MambaAttention, were benchmarked for
severity prediction. While TabPFN demonstrated strong generalization,
MambaAttention achieved superior performance in classifying severe injury cases
due to its attention-based feature reweighting. The findings highlight the
potential of deep tabular architectures for improving crash severity prediction
and enabling data-driven safety interventions in EV crash contexts.

Motivation: 传统多目标强化学习使用固定权重线性标量化，无法有效处理非凸帕累托前沿，特别是在大语言模型在线偏好对齐中，随机轨迹产生的参数到目标映射高度非线性和非凸，需要动态权重调整机制。

Method: 提出动态奖励加权方法，包含两种策略：(1)超体积引导权重适应，通过帕累托前沿的超体积指标动态调整权重；(2)梯度优化权重，直接优化权重参数来平衡不同目标。

Result: 实验证明该方法与GRPO、REINFORCE、RLOO等在线强化学习算法兼容，在多个数学推理数据集上有效，适用于不同模型家族，能以更少训练步骤获得帕累托占优解。

Conclusion: 动态奖励加权为在线多目标对齐提供了通用工具包，能够有效探索目标空间的帕累托前沿，显著优于固定权重线性标量化基线方法。

Abstract: Prior works in multi-objective reinforcement learning typically use linear
reward scalarization with fixed weights, which provably fail to capture
non-convex Pareto fronts and thus yield suboptimal results. This limitation
becomes especially critical in online preference alignment for large language
models. Here, stochastic trajectories generated by parameterized policies
create highly non-linear and non-convex mappings from parameters to objectives
that no single static weighting scheme can find optimal trade-offs. We address
this limitation by introducing dynamic reward weighting, which adaptively
adjusts reward weights during the online reinforcement learning process. Unlike
existing approaches that rely on fixed-weight interpolation, our dynamic
weighting continuously balances and prioritizes objectives in training,
facilitating effective exploration of Pareto fronts in objective space. We
introduce two approaches of increasing sophistication and generalizability: (1)
hypervolume-guided weight adaptation and (2) gradient-based weight
optimization, offering a versatile toolkit for online multi-objective
alignment. Our extensive experiments demonstrate their compatibility with
commonly used online reinforcement learning algorithms (including GRPO,
REINFORCE, and RLOO), effectiveness across multiple mathematical reasoning
datasets, and applicability to different model families, consistently achieving
Pareto dominant solutions with fewer training steps than fixed-weight linear
scalarization baselines.

Abstract: Drug repurposing has historically been an economically infeasible process for
identifying novel uses for abandoned drugs. Modern machine learning has enabled
the identification of complex biochemical intricacies in candidate drugs;
however, many studies rely on simplified datasets with known drug-disease
similarities. We propose a machine learning pipeline that uses unsupervised
deep embedded clustering, combined with supervised graph neural network link
prediction to identify new drug-disease links from multi-omic data.
Unsupervised autoencoder and cluster training reduced the dimensionality of
omic data into a compressed latent embedding. A total of 9,022 unique drugs
were partitioned into 35 clusters with a mean silhouette score of 0.8550. Graph
neural networks achieved strong statistical performance, with a prediction
accuracy of 0.901, receiver operating characteristic area under the curve of
0.960, and F1-Score of 0.901. A ranked list comprised of 477 per-cluster link
probabilities exceeding 99 percent was generated. This study could provide new
drug-disease link prospects across unrelated disease domains, while advancing
the understanding of machine learning in drug repurposing studies.

Motivation: 解决深度神经网络在关键应用中存在的推理延迟和可信度问题，特别是早期退出策略因模型过度自信导致的不可靠预测问题

Method: 提出SPEED方法，在每层使用延迟分类器(DCs)来检查样本的难度，而不是仅依赖置信度分数。DCs识别难以预测的样本并将其推迟给专家处理

Result: 错误预测风险降低50%，推理速度相比最终层提升2.05倍，同时提高了准确性和延迟性能

Conclusion: 选择性预测与早期退出相结合的方法能够有效平衡推理速度和预测可信度，为关键应用中的DNN部署提供了可靠解决方案

Abstract: Inference latency and trustworthiness of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are the
bottlenecks in deploying them in critical applications like sensitive tasks.
Early Exit (EE) DNNs overcome the latency issues by allowing samples to exit
from intermediary layers if they attain `high' confidence scores on the
predicted class. However, the DNNs are known to exhibit overconfidence, which
can lead to many samples exiting early and render EE strategies untrustworthy.
We use Selective Prediction (SP) to overcome this issue by checking the
`hardness' of the samples rather than just relying on the confidence score
alone. We propose SPEED, a novel approach that uses Deferral Classifiers (DCs)
at each layer to check the hardness of samples before performing EEs.
Specifically, the DCs identify if a sample is hard to predict at an
intermediary layer, leading to hallucination, and defer it to an expert. Early
detection of hard samples for inference prevents the wastage of computational
resources and improves trust by deferring the hard samples to the expert. We
demonstrate that EE aided with SP improves both accuracy and latency. Our
method minimizes the risk of wrong prediction by $50\%$ with a speedup of
$2.05\times$ as compared to the final layer. The anonymized source code is

Conclusion: 通过知识萌荐技术可以有效地将大型模型的对抗性能力传递给小型模型，实现了稳健性和准确性的双重提升

Abstract: Deep learning models are vulnerable to adversarial examples, posing critical
security challenges in real-world applications. While Adversarial Training (AT
) is a widely adopted defense mechanism to enhance robustness, it often incurs
a trade-off by degrading performance on unperturbed, natural data. Recent
efforts have highlighted that larger models exhibit enhanced robustness over
their smaller counterparts. In this paper, we empirically demonstrate that such
robustness can be systematically distilled from large teacher models into
compact student models. To achieve better performance, we introduce Dice
Adversarial Robustness Distillation (DARD), a novel method designed to transfer
robustness through a tailored knowledge distillation paradigm. Additionally, we
propose Dice Projected Gradient Descent (DPGD), an adversarial example
generalization method optimized for effective attack. Our extensive experiments
demonstrate that the DARD approach consistently outperforms adversarially
trained networks with the same architecture, achieving superior robustness and
standard accuracy.

Motivation: 解决当前GUI代理中离线RL和在线RL的两难问题：离线RL缺乏多步任务执行的轨迹级回报信号，而在线RL虽能获取这些信号但遇到稀疏回报和部署成本高的问题。

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents have demonstrated remarkable progress
in automating complex user interface interactions through reinforcement
learning. However, current approaches face a fundamental dilemma: offline RL
enables stable training on pre-collected trajectories, but struggles with
multi-step task execution for lack of trajectory-level reward signals; online
RL captures these signals through environment interaction, but suffers from
sparse rewards and prohibitive deployment costs. To address it, we present
Semi-online Reinforcement Learning, a novel paradigm that simulates online RL
on offline trajectories. During each rollout process, we preserve the original
model output within the multi-turn dialogue, where a Patch Module adaptively
recovers the divergence between rollout and expert trajectories. To capture
long-term training signals, Semi-online RL introduces discounted future returns
into the reward computation and optimizes the policy with weighted step-level
and episode-level advantages. We further introduce Semi-Online Performance
(SOP), a metric that aligns better with true online performance, serving as a
practical and effective proxy for real-world evaluation. Experiments show that
ours Semi-online RL achieves SOTA performance among 7B models across four
dynamic benchmarks, with significant gains over the base model (e.g., +12.0% on
AndroidWorld, +23.8% on AITW), demonstrating significant progress in bridging
the gap between offline training efficiency and online multi-turn reasoning.

behind compressed sensing is that many real-world signals are inherently

this paper we will explore the mathematical formulation behind compressed
sensing, its logic and pathologies, and apply compressed sensing to real world
signals.

Motivation: 现有深度学习方法在网络状态分类中存在关键权衡：专注于时间模式的方法忽略变量依赖关系，而专注于依赖关系的方法无法捕获细粒度时间细节。需要一种能够同时处理这两个特征的统一框架。

Method: 提出DAPNet框架，采用专家混合架构，包含三个专家网络：周期性分析专家、动态跨变量相关性建模专家、混合时间特征提取专家。通过可学习的门控网络动态分配权重，并使用混合正则化损失函数解决类别不平衡问题。

Result: 在两个大规模网络入侵检测数据集(CICIDS2017/2018)上的广泛实验验证了DAPNet在目标应用中具有更高的准确性。在十个公共UEA基准数据集上的评估证明了架构设计的通用性。

Conclusion: DAPNet作为一个专门用于网络状态分类的框架，成功解决了同时捕获时间周期性和变量依赖关系的挑战，在多个数据集上表现出优越性能，具有良好的通用性和实用性。

Abstract: Effective network state classification is a primary task for ensuring network
security and optimizing performance. Existing deep learning models have shown
considerable progress in this area. Some methods excel at analyzing the complex
temporal periodicities found in traffic data, while graph-based approaches are
adept at modeling the dynamic dependencies between different variables.
However, a key trade-off remains, as these methods struggle to capture both
characteristics simultaneously. Models focused on temporal patterns often
overlook crucial variable dependencies, whereas those centered on dependencies
may fail to capture fine-grained temporal details. To address this trade-off,
we introduce DAPNet, a framework based on a Mixture-of-Experts architecture.
DAPNet integrates three specialized networks for periodic analysis, dynamic
cross-variable correlation modeling, and hybrid temporal feature extraction. A
learnable gating network dynamically assigns weights to experts based on the
input sample and computes a weighted fusion of their outputs. Furthermore, a
hybrid regularization loss function ensures stable training and addresses the
common issue of class imbalance. Extensive experiments on two large-scale
network intrusion detection datasets (CICIDS2017/2018) validate DAPNet's higher
accuracy for its target application. The generalizability of the architectural
design is evaluated across ten public UEA benchmark datasets, positioning
DAPNet as a specialized framework for network state classification.

Abstract: Reservoir is an efficient network for time series processing. It is well
known that network structure is one of the determinants of its performance.
However, the topology structure of reservoirs, as well as their performance, is
hard to analyzed, due to the lack of suitable mathematical tools. In this
paper, we study the topology structure of reservoirs using persistent GLMY
homology theory, and develop a method to improve its performance. Specifically,
it is found that the reservoir performance is closely related to the
one-dimensional GLMY homology groups. Then, we develop a reservoir structure
optimization method by modifying the minimal representative cycles of
one-dimensional GLMY homology groups. Finally, by experiments, it is validated
that the performance of reservoirs is jointly influenced by the reservoir
structure and the periodicity of the dataset.

Conclusion: 该框架为终端用户提供了额外的保护工具，通过理论证明和实证验证了隐私-效用权衡的紧密边界，有效解决了遗忘方法无法防护的测试时隐私威胁。

Abstract: Unlearning is the predominant method for removing the influence of data in
machine learning models. However, even after unlearning, models often continue
to produce the same predictions on the unlearned data with high confidence.
This persistent behavior can be exploited by adversaries using confident model
predictions on incorrect or obsolete data to harm users. We call this threat
model, which unlearning fails to protect against, *test-time privacy*. In
particular, an adversary with full model access can bypass any naive defenses
which ensure test-time privacy. To address this threat, we introduce an
algorithm which perturbs model weights to induce maximal uncertainty on
protected instances while preserving accuracy on the rest of the instances. Our
core algorithm is based on finetuning with a Pareto optimal objective that
explicitly balances test-time privacy against utility. We also provide a
certifiable approximation algorithm which achieves $(\varepsilon, \delta)$
guarantees without convexity assumptions. We then prove a tight, non-vacuous
bound that characterizes the privacy-utility tradeoff that our algorithms
incur. Empirically, our method obtains $>3\times$ stronger uncertainty than
pretraining with $<0.2\%$ drops in accuracy on various image recognition
benchmarks. Altogether, this framework provides a tool to guarantee additional
protection to end users.

Conclusion: SpeCa为扩散模型推理建立了新的高效范式，在激进加速比下仍能保持生成质量，验证机制开销极小

Abstract: Diffusion models have revolutionized high-fidelity image and video synthesis,
yet their computational demands remain prohibitive for real-time applications.
These models face two fundamental challenges: strict temporal dependencies
preventing parallelization, and computationally intensive forward passes
required at each denoising step. Drawing inspiration from speculative decoding
in large language models, we present SpeCa, a novel 'Forecast-then-verify'
acceleration framework that effectively addresses both limitations. SpeCa's
core innovation lies in introducing Speculative Sampling to diffusion models,
predicting intermediate features for subsequent timesteps based on fully
computed reference timesteps. Our approach implements a parameter-free
verification mechanism that efficiently evaluates prediction reliability,
enabling real-time decisions to accept or reject each prediction while
incurring negligible computational overhead. Furthermore, SpeCa introduces
sample-adaptive computation allocation that dynamically modulates resources
based on generation complexity, allocating reduced computation for simpler
samples while preserving intensive processing for complex instances.
Experiments demonstrate 6.34x acceleration on FLUX with minimal quality
degradation (5.5% drop), 7.3x speedup on DiT while preserving generation
fidelity, and 79.84% VBench score at 6.1x acceleration for HunyuanVideo. The
verification mechanism incurs minimal overhead (1.67%-3.5% of full inference
costs), establishing a new paradigm for efficient diffusion model inference
while maintaining generation quality even at aggressive acceleration ratios.

Conclusion: 该方法不仅能拒绝有害查询，还能提供安全的替代回复，并证明安全对齐可能需要更少的数据。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance in capabilities, ensuring
their safety against jailbreak attacks remains a critical challenge. In this
paper, we introduce a novel safety alignment approach called Answer-Then-Check,
which enhances LLM robustness against malicious prompts by applying thinking
ability to mitigate jailbreaking problems before producing a final answer to
the user. Our method enables models to directly answer the question in their
thought and then critically evaluate its safety before deciding whether to
provide it. To implement this approach, we construct the Reasoned Safety
Alignment (ReSA) dataset, comprising 80K examples that teach models to reason
through direct responses and then analyze their safety. Experimental results
demonstrate that our approach achieves the Pareto frontier with superior safety
capability while decreasing over-refusal rates on over-refusal benchmarks.
Notably, the model fine-tuned with ReSA maintains general reasoning
capabilities on benchmarks like MMLU, MATH500, and HumanEval. Besides, our
method equips models with the ability to perform safe completion. Unlike
post-hoc methods that can only reject harmful queries, our model can provide
helpful and safe alternative responses for sensitive topics (e.g., self-harm).
Furthermore, we discover that training on a small subset of just 500 examples
can achieve comparable performance to using the full dataset, suggesting that
safety alignment may require less data than previously assumed.

Abstract: Anomaly detection in dynamic graphs is essential for identifying malicious
activities, fraud, and unexpected behaviors in real-world systems such as
cybersecurity and power grids. However, existing approaches struggle with
scalability, probabilistic interpretability, and adaptability to evolving
traffic patterns. In this paper, we propose ADAPTIVE-GRAPHSKETCH, a lightweight

Our method integrates temporal multi-tensor sketching with Count-Min Sketch
using Conservative Update (CMS-CU) to compactly track edge frequency patterns
with bounded memory, while mitigating hash collision issues. We incorporate
Bayesian inference for probabilistic anomaly scoring and apply Exponentially
Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) for adaptive thresholding tuned to burst
intensity. Extensive experiments on four real-world intrusion detection
datasets demonstrate that ADAPTIVE-GRAPHSKETCH outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines such as ANOEDGE-G/L, MIDAS-R, and F-FADE, achieving up to 6.5% AUC
gain on CIC-IDS2018 and up to 15.6% on CIC-DDoS2019, while processing 20
million edges in under 3.4 seconds using only 10 hash functions. Our results

Abstract: Assessing the impact of a disaster in terms of asset losses and human
casualties is essential for preparing effective response plans. Traditional
methods include offline assessments conducted on the ground, where volunteers
and first responders work together to collect the estimate of losses through
windshield surveys or on-ground inspection. However, these methods have a time
delay and are prone to different biases. Recently, various online data sources,
including social media, news reports, aerial imagery, and satellite data, have
been utilized to evaluate the impact of disasters. Online data sources provide
real-time data streams for estimating the offline impact. Limited research
exists on how different online sources help estimate disaster impact at a given
administrative unit. In our work, we curate a comprehensive dataset by
collecting data from multiple online sources for a few billion-dollar disasters
at the county level. We also analyze how online estimates compare with
traditional offline-based impact estimates for the disaster. Our findings
provide insight into how different sources can provide complementary

Motivation: 目前缺乏对序列图转换为PlantUML格式的系统性评估方法，现有研究没有对各组件进行详细对比分析。

Method: 选取3GPP文档中的序列图作为数据集，使用Claude Sonnet和GPT-4V两个VLMs进行转换，与手动创建的真实标签进行对比，采用版本控制工具捕捉差异，并引入标准性能指标。

Result: 结果显示节点、边缘和消息能够准确捕捉，但复杂结构如注释、框架、组织结构的转换效果较差。

Conclusion: 实验结果表明需要在训练数据中提高复杂结构的表示质量，以改善精细调整的VLMs在这些组件上的性能。

Abstract: Telecom domain 3GPP documents are replete with images containing sequence
diagrams. Advances in Vision-Language Large Models (VLMs) have eased conversion
of such images to machine-readable PlantUML (puml) formats. However, there is a
gap in evaluation of such conversions - existing works do not compare puml
scripts for various components. In this work, we propose performance metrics to
measure the effectiveness of such conversions. A dataset of sequence diagrams
from 3GPP documents is chosen to be representative of domain-specific actual
scenarios. We compare puml outputs from two VLMs - Claude Sonnet and GPT-4V -
against manually created ground truth representations. We use version control
tools to capture differences and introduce standard performance metrics to
measure accuracies along various components: participant identification,
message flow accuracy, sequence ordering, and grouping construct preservation.
We demonstrate effectiveness of proposed metrics in quantifying conversion
errors across various components of puml scripts. The results show that nodes,
edges and messages are accurately captured. However, we observe that VLMs do
not necessarily perform well on complex structures such as notes, box, groups.
Our experiments and performance metrics indicates a need for better
representation of these components in training data for fine-tuned VLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统灾害分析工具只能进行预测性分析，无法支持人为干预和反事实场景模拟，导致缺乏可行动的减灾规划建议。

Method: 利用实时数据源（卫星图像、新闻、社交媒体）构建干预性工具，支持用户修改输入状态模拟反事实场景，并分析不同因素对灾害严重程度的因果归因。

Result: 开发了一种能够进行反事实模拟的干预性灾害分析工具，能够提供可行动的减灾建议，并公开了源代码。

Conclusion: 该工具补充了传统灾害模型的工具链，通过干预性分析和反事实模拟能够提供更好的灾害管理和减灾规划支持。

Abstract: Traditional disaster analysis and modelling tools for assessing the severity
of a disaster are predictive in nature. Based on the past observational data,
these tools prescribe how the current input state (e.g., environmental
conditions, situation reports) results in a severity assessment. However, these
systems are not meant to be interventional in the causal sense, where the user
can modify the current input state to simulate counterfactual "what-if"
scenarios. In this work, we provide an alternative interventional tool that
complements traditional disaster modelling tools by leveraging real-time data
sources like satellite imagery, news, and social media. Our tool also helps
understand the causal attribution of different factors on the estimated
severity, over any given region of interest. In addition, we provide actionable
recourses that would enable easier mitigation planning. Our source code is
publicly available.

TL;DR: CANOE是一个用于下一个位置预测的混沌神经振荡器网络，通过生物启发的注意力机制和上下文融合，有效解决了移动模式动态不平衡和上下文利用不足的问题，在多个数据集上显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在两个主要问题：1) 无法处理周期性和混沌移动模式之间的动态不平衡，导致对稀疏轨迹的适应性不足；2) 未能充分利用上下文线索（如到达时间的时间规律性），这些线索即使在混沌模式中也存在，并且由于搜索空间减小而比空间预测具有更强的可预测性。

Method: 提出CANOE模型，包含：1) 生物启发的混沌神经振荡注意力机制，为传统注意力注入自适应变异性，实现演化移动行为的平衡表示；2) 三重交互编码器和跨上下文注意力解码器，在联合框架中融合多模态"谁-何时-何地"上下文。

Result: 在两个真实数据集上的实验表明，CANOE始终显著优于大量最先进的基线方法，在不同情况下相比最佳基线有3.17%-13.11%的提升。特别是CANOE能够对不同移动混沌级别的轨迹进行稳健预测。消融研究也支持关键设计选择。

Conclusion: CANOE通过创新的混沌神经振荡器架构和上下文融合机制，有效解决了下一个位置预测中的动态不平衡和上下文利用问题，为人类移动性分析提供了更强大的预测能力。

Abstract: Next location prediction is a key task in human mobility analysis, crucial
for applications like smart city resource allocation and personalized
navigation services. However, existing methods face two significant challenges:
first, they fail to address the dynamic imbalance between periodic and chaotic
mobile patterns, leading to inadequate adaptation over sparse trajectories;
second, they underutilize contextual cues, such as temporal regularities in
arrival times, which persist even in chaotic patterns and offer stronger
predictability than spatial forecasts due to reduced search spaces. To tackle
these challenges, we propose \textbf{\method}, a
\underline{\textbf{C}}h\underline{\textbf{A}}otic \underline{\textbf{N}}eural
\underline{\textbf{O}}scillator n\underline{\textbf{E}}twork for next location
prediction, which introduces a biologically inspired Chaotic Neural Oscillatory
Attention mechanism to inject adaptive variability into traditional attention,
enabling balanced representation of evolving mobility behaviors, and employs a
Tri-Pair Interaction Encoder along with a Cross Context Attentive Decoder to
fuse multimodal ``who-when-where'' contexts in a joint framework for enhanced
prediction performance. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets
demonstrate that CANOE consistently and significantly outperforms a sizeable
collection of state-of-the-art baselines, yielding 3.17\%-13.11\% improvement
over the best-performing baselines across different cases. In particular, CANOE
can make robust predictions over mobility trajectories of different mobility
chaotic levels. A series of ablation studies also supports our key design
choices. Our code is available at: https://github.com/yuqian2003/CANOE.

<details>

Motivation: 随着大型基础模型的兴起，分割推理成为流行部署范式，但现有数据重建攻击主要针对小型CNN分类模型，大型基础模型在分割推理中的隐私风险尚未充分探索

Method: 基于引导扩散的数据重建攻击，利用在大规模数据集上预训练的潜在扩散模型（LDM）中嵌入的丰富先验知识，在LDM学习到的图像先验上进行迭代重建

Result: 大量实验表明，该方法在从视觉基础模型的深层中间表示重建数据方面，在定性和定量上都显著优于最先进方法

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了在分割推理场景中为大型模型开发更强大隐私保护机制的紧迫性

Abstract: With the rise of large foundation models, split inference (SI) has emerged as
a popular computational paradigm for deploying models across lightweight edge
devices and cloud servers, addressing data privacy and computational cost
concerns. However, most existing data reconstruction attacks have focused on
smaller CNN classification models, leaving the privacy risks of foundation
models in SI settings largely unexplored. To address this gap, we propose a
novel data reconstruction attack based on guided diffusion, which leverages the
rich prior knowledge embedded in a latent diffusion model (LDM) pre-trained on
a large-scale dataset. Our method performs iterative reconstruction on the
LDM's learned image prior, effectively generating high-fidelity images
resembling the original data from their intermediate representations (IR).
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, both qualitatively and quantitatively, in
reconstructing data from deep-layer IRs of the vision foundation model. The
results highlight the urgent need for more robust privacy protection mechanisms
for large models in SI scenarios. Code is available at:

Method: 采用k-近邻回归模型，结合化学信息距离度量（包括核诱导度量和MLKR学习度量），使用FCHL19等分子描述符

Result: k-NN模型在精度上可与复杂的核岭回归模型相媲美，计算时间减少数个数量级，在超过25万条数据的大数据集上表现良好，对未见大团簇的外推误差接近1 kcal/mol

Abstract: Understanding how atmospheric molecular clusters form and grow is key to
resolving one of the biggest uncertainties in climate modelling: the formation
of new aerosol particles. While quantum chemistry offers accurate insights into
these early-stage clusters, its steep computational costs limit large-scale
exploration. In this work, we present a fast, interpretable, and surprisingly
powerful alternative: $k$-nearest neighbour ($k$-NN) regression model. By
leveraging chemically informed distance metrics, including a kernel-induced
metric and one learned via metric learning for kernel regression (MLKR), we
show that simple $k$-NN models can rival more complex kernel ridge regression
(KRR) models in accuracy, while reducing computational time by orders of
magnitude. We perform this comparison with the well-established
Faber-Christensen-Huang-Lilienfeld (FCHL19) molecular descriptor, but other
descriptors (e.g., FCHL18, MBDF, and CM) can be shown to have similar
performance. Applied to both simple organic molecules in the QM9 benchmark set
and large datasets of atmospheric molecular clusters (sulphuric acid-water and
sulphuric-multibase -base systems), our $k$-NN models achieve near-chemical
accuracy, scale seamlessly to datasets with over 250,000 entries, and even
appears to extrapolate to larger unseen clusters with minimal error (often
nearing 1 kcal/mol). With built-in interpretability and straightforward
uncertainty estimation, this work positions $k$-NN as a potent tool for
accelerating discovery in atmospheric chemistry and beyond.

Method: 使用296份散货舶航行报告，结合Copernicus海洋环境监测服务(19个参数)和ECMWF(61个参数)的海洋天气大数据，构建燃油消耗预测模型

Result: 机器学习技术能够准确预测船舶燃油消耗，外部公共数据源融合提高了模型准确性，识别出了影响燃油消耗的关键参数

Conclusion: 研究证明了外部海洋天气数据融合对燃油消耗预测的价值，但需要在相似舶船类型上进一步验证模型的普适性

Abstract: There is an increasing push for operational measures to reduce ships' bunker
fuel consumption and carbon emissions, driven by the International Maritime
Organization (IMO) mandates. Key performance indicators such as the Energy
Efficiency Operational Indicator (EEOI) focus on fuel efficiency. Strategies
like trim optimization, virtual arrival, and green routing have emerged. The
theoretical basis for these approaches lies in accurate prediction of fuel
consumption as a function of sailing speed, displacement, trim, climate, and
sea state. This study utilized 296 voyage reports from a bulk carrier vessel
over one year (November 16, 2021 to November 21, 2022) and 28 parameters,
integrating hydrometeorological big data from the Copernicus Marine Environment
Monitoring Service (CMEMS) with 19 parameters and the European Centre for
Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) with 61 parameters. The objective was to
evaluate whether fusing external public data sources enhances modeling accuracy
and to highlight the most influential parameters affecting fuel consumption.
The results reveal a strong potential for machine learning techniques to
predict ship fuel consumption accurately by combining voyage reports with
climate and sea data. However, validation on similar classes of vessels remains
necessary to confirm generalizability.

Motivation: 物理信息神经网络(PINNs)的损失函数在动力系统固定点处存在局部极小值，这会影响训练并导致物理不正确的解，特别是在前向问题求解初值问题时

Method: 基于稳定性理论，提出了一种正则化方案，专门惩罚对应于不稳定固定点的解

Result: 在四个动力系统（包括Lotka-Volterra模型和van der Pol振荡器）上的实验表明，该方案能有效避免物理不正确的解，并显著提高PINNs的训练成功率

Conclusion: 所提出的正则化方案能够有效解决PINNs训练中的局部极小值问题，提高求解动力系统初值问题的准确性和可靠性

Abstract: It was recently shown that the loss function used for training
physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) exhibits local minima at solutions
corresponding to fixed points of dynamical systems. In the forward setting,
where the PINN is trained to solve initial value problems, these local minima
can interfere with training and potentially leading to physically incorrect
solutions. Building on stability theory, this paper proposes a regularization
scheme that penalizes solutions corresponding to unstable fixed points.
Experimental results on four dynamical systems, including the Lotka-Volterra
model and the van der Pol oscillator, show that our scheme helps avoiding
physically incorrect solutions and substantially improves the training success
rate of PINNs.

Abstract: The enzyme turnover rate is a fundamental parameter in enzyme kinetics,
reflecting the catalytic efficiency of enzymes. However, enzyme turnover rates
remain scarce across most organisms due to the high cost and complexity of
experimental measurements. To address this gap, we propose a multimodal
framework for predicting the enzyme turnover rate by integrating enzyme
sequences, substrate structures, and environmental factors. Our model combines
a pre-trained language model and a convolutional neural network to extract
features from protein sequences, while a graph neural network captures
informative representations from substrate molecules. An attention mechanism is
incorporated to enhance interactions between enzyme and substrate
representations. Furthermore, we leverage symbolic regression via
Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks to explicitly learn mathematical formulas that
govern the enzyme turnover rate, enabling interpretable and accurate
predictions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework outperforms
both traditional and state-of-the-art deep learning approaches. This work
provides a robust tool for studying enzyme kinetics and holds promise for
applications in enzyme engineering, biotechnology, and industrial biocatalysis.

Abstract: Real-time fall detection is crucial for enabling timely interventions and
mitigating the severe health consequences of falls, particularly in older
adults. However, existing methods often rely on simulated data or assumptions
such as prior knowledge of fall events, limiting their real-world
applicability. Practical deployment also requires efficient computation and
robust evaluation metrics tailored to continuous monitoring. This paper
presents a real-time fall detection framework for continuous monitoring without
prior knowledge of fall events. Using over 60 hours of inertial measurement
unit (IMU) data from the FARSEEING real-world falls dataset, we employ recent
efficient classifiers to compute fall probabilities in streaming mode. To
enhance robustness, we introduce a cost-sensitive learning strategy that tunes
the decision threshold using a cost function reflecting the higher risk of
missed falls compared to false alarms. Unlike many methods that achieve high
recall only at the cost of precision, our framework achieved Recall of 1.00,
Precision of 0.84, and an F1 score of 0.91 on FARSEEING, detecting all falls
while keeping false alarms low, with average inference time below 5 ms per
sample. These results demonstrate that cost-sensitive threshold tuning enhances
the robustness of accelerometer-based fall detection. They also highlight the
potential of our computationally efficient framework for deployment in
real-time wearable sensor systems for continuous monitoring.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are powerful models for graph-structured data,
with broad applications. However, the interplay between GNN parameter
optimization, expressivity, and generalization remains poorly understood. We
address this by introducing an efficient learnable dimensionality reduction
method for visualizing GNN loss landscapes, and by analyzing the effects of
over-smoothing, jumping knowledge, quantization, sparsification, and
preconditioner on GNN optimization. Our learnable projection method surpasses
the state-of-the-art PCA-based approach, enabling accurate reconstruction of
high-dimensional parameters with lower memory usage. We further show that
architecture, sparsification, and optimizer's preconditioning significantly
impact the GNN optimization landscape and their training process and final
prediction performance. These insights contribute to developing more efficient
designs of GNN architectures and training strategies.

  We perform PCA on activations and module output gradients to identify

Motivation: 现有的联邦域适应方法主要关注域偏移问题，假设目标数据充足，但往往忽视了域偏移和数据稀缺的双重挑战。同时，现有方法未能根据目标目标优先共享源客户端的相关信息

Method: FedDAF使用基于相似性的全局源模型和目标模型聚合方法，通过计算它们在目标数据上的平均梯度场之间的模型功能距离。计算两个模型之间的角度，然后用Gompertz函数进行归一化。全局源模型通过服务器中对所有本地源模型进行简单平均来构建

Conclusion: FedDAF是一种有效的联邦域适应方法，能够同时处理域偏移和数据稀缺问题，通过目标导向的模型聚合实现更好的性能

Abstract: Federated Domain Adaptation (FDA) is a federated learning (FL) approach that
improves model performance at the target client by collaborating with source
clients while preserving data privacy. FDA faces two primary challenges: domain
shifts between source and target data and limited labeled data at the target.
Most existing FDA methods focus on domain shifts, assuming ample target data,
yet often neglect the combined challenges of both domain shifts and data
scarcity. Moreover, approaches that address both challenges fail to prioritize
sharing relevant information from source clients according to the target's
objective. In this paper, we propose FedDAF, a novel approach addressing both
challenges in FDA. FedDAF uses similarity-based aggregation of the global
source model and target model by calculating model functional distance from
their mean gradient fields computed on target data. This enables effective
model aggregation based on the target objective, constructed using target data,
even with limited data. While computing model functional distance between these
two models, FedDAF computes the angle between their mean gradient fields and
then normalizes with the Gompertz function. To construct the global source
model, all the local source models are aggregated using simple average in the
server. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate FedDAF's superiority
over existing FL, PFL, and FDA methods in terms of achieving better test
accuracy.

Abstract: Long-term unemployment (LTU) is a challenge for both jobseekers and public
employment services. Statistical profiling tools are increasingly used to
predict LTU risk. Some profiling tools are opaque, black-box machine learning
models, which raise issues of transparency and fairness. This paper
investigates whether interpretable models could serve as an alternative, using
administrative data from Switzerland. Traditional statistical, interpretable,
and black-box models are compared in terms of predictive performance,
interpretability, and fairness. It is shown that explainable boosting machines,
a recent interpretable model, perform nearly as well as the best black-box
models. It is also shown how model sparsity, feature smoothing, and fairness
mitigation can enhance transparency and fairness with only minor losses in
performance. These findings suggest that interpretable profiling provides an
accountable and trustworthy alternative to black-box models without
compromising performance.

Abstract: Evaluating tabular generators remains a challenging problem, as the unique
causal structural prior of heterogeneous tabular data does not lend itself to
intuitive human inspection. Recent work has introduced structural fidelity as a
tabular-specific evaluation dimension to assess whether synthetic data complies
with the causal structures of real data. However, existing benchmarks often
neglect the interplay between structural fidelity and conventional evaluation
dimensions, thus failing to provide a holistic understanding of model
performance. Moreover, they are typically limited to toy datasets, as
quantifying existing structural fidelity metrics requires access to
ground-truth causal structures, which are rarely available for real-world
datasets. In this paper, we propose a novel evaluation framework that jointly
considers structural fidelity and conventional evaluation dimensions. We
introduce a new evaluation metric, $\textbf{global utility}$, which enables the
assessment of structural fidelity even in the absence of ground-truth causal
structures. In addition, we present $\textbf{TabStruct}$, a comprehensive
evaluation benchmark offering large-scale quantitative analysis on 13 tabular
generators from nine distinct categories, across 29 datasets. Our results
demonstrate that global utility provides a task-independent, domain-agnostic
lens for tabular generator performance. We release the TabStruct benchmark
suite, including all datasets, evaluation pipelines, and raw results. Code is

Conclusion: 该方法为处理随机渗透率场的多孔弹性系统提供了一种可扩展、高效的替代模建技术，具有广阔的应用潜力

Abstract: Poroelasticity -- coupled fluid flow and elastic deformation in porous media
-- often involves spatially variable permeability, especially in subsurface
systems. In such cases, simulations with random permeability fields are widely
used for probabilistic analysis, uncertainty quantification, and inverse
problems. These simulations require repeated forward solves that are often
prohibitively expensive, motivating the development of efficient surrogate
models. However, efficient surrogate modeling techniques for poroelasticity
with random permeability fields remain scarce. In this study, we propose a
surrogate modeling framework based on the deep operator network (DeepONet), a
neural architecture designed to learn mappings between infinite-dimensional
function spaces. The proposed surrogate model approximates the solution
operator that maps random permeability fields to transient poroelastic
responses. To enhance predictive accuracy and stability, we integrate three
strategies: nondimensionalization of the governing equations, input
dimensionality reduction via Karhunen--Lo\'eve expansion, and a two-step
training procedure that decouples the optimization of branch and trunk
networks. The methodology is evaluated on two benchmark problems in
poroelasticity: soil consolidation and ground subsidence induced by groundwater
extraction. In both cases, the DeepONet achieves substantial speedup in
inference while maintaining high predictive accuracy across a wide range of
permeability statistics. These results highlight the potential of the proposed
approach as a scalable and efficient surrogate modeling technique for
poroelastic systems with random permeability fields.

TL;DR: MillStone是首个系统测量外部论点对LLM在争议问题上立场影响的基准测试，发现LLM大多持开放态度但容易被权威信息源影响立场


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着用户开始依赖LLM获取包括争议话题在内的各种信息，需要理解LLM输出中的立场和观点如何受到其使用的信息源文档的影响

Method: 开发MillStone基准测试，应用于9个领先的LLM，测量它们对争议问题对立面论点的开放程度、LLM间的共识度、最具说服力的论点以及不同LLM间的差异

Result: LLM在大多数问题上持开放态度，但权威信息源可以轻易改变LLM的立场，凸显了信息源选择的重要性以及LLM信息检索系统可能被操纵的风险

Conclusion: 需要关注LLM信息检索系统中信息源的选择和潜在操纵风险，确保LLM输出的立场和观点基于可靠和平衡的信息源

Abstract: Large language models equipped with Web search, information retrieval tools,
and other agentic capabilities are beginning to supplant traditional search
engines. As users start to rely on LLMs for information on many topics,
including controversial and debatable issues, it is important to understand how
the stances and opinions expressed in LLM outputs are influenced by the
documents they use as their information sources.
  In this paper, we present MillStone, the first benchmark that aims to
systematically measure the effect of external arguments on the stances that
LLMs take on controversial issues (not all of them political). We apply
MillStone to nine leading LLMs and measure how ``open-minded'' they are to
arguments supporting opposite sides of these issues, whether different LLMs
agree with each other, which arguments LLMs find most persuasive, and whether
these arguments are the same for different LLMs.
  In general, we find that LLMs are open-minded on most issues. An
authoritative source of information can easily sway an LLM's stance,
highlighting the importance of source selection and the risk that LLM-based
information retrieval and search systems can be manipulated.

<details>

Motivation: 金融氛泡往往突然出现且造成长远经济影响，研究者想通过分析科学论文引用网络来预测未来氛泡的出现和破裂

Method: 采用时序社会网络分析(SNA)技术，对比分析两个技术时代：网络氛泡时代(1994-2001)和AI时代(2017-2024)的论文引用网络与金融市场数据关系

Result: 网络氛泡时代的模式无法确定预测AI氛泡的起伏，年度引用网络显示科学家发表行为在两个时代有差异，但有部分AI时代科学家的影响模式与网络氛泡时代相似

Conclusion: 网络氛泡时代的模式无法有效外推到AI市场，数据指向两种可能性：AI氛泡形态无前例或不存在

Abstract: Financial bubbles often arrive without much warning, but create long-lasting
economic effects. For example, during the dot-com bubble, innovative
technologies created market disruptions through excitement for a promised
bright future. Such technologies originated from research where scientists had
developed them for years prior to their entry into the markets. That raises a
question on the possibility of analyzing scientific publishing data (e.g.
citation networks) leading up to a bubble for signals that may forecast the
rise and fall of similar future bubbles. To that end, we utilized temporal SNAs
to detect possible relationships between the publication citation networks of
scientists and financial market data during two modern eras of rapidly shifting
technology: 1) dot-com era from 1994 to 2001 and 2) AI era from 2017 to 2024.
Results showed that the patterns from the dot-com era (which did end in a
bubble) did not definitively predict the rise and fall of an AI bubble. While
yearly citation networks reflected possible changes in publishing behavior of
scientists between the two eras, there was a subset of AI era scientists whose
publication influence patterns mirrored those during the dot-com era. Upon
further analysis using multiple analysis techniques (LSTM, KNN, AR X/GARCH),
the data seems to suggest two possibilities for the AI era: unprecedented form
of financial bubble unseen or that no bubble exists. In conclusion, our
findings imply that the patterns present in the dot-com era do not effectively
translate in such a manner to apply them to the AI market.

Motivation: 神经网络训练本质上是大规模矩阵优化问题，但长期以来忽视了参数矩阵结构。Muon优化器通过显式利用矩阵结构取得了显著效果，其中矩阵正交化是关键组件。

Method: 提出低秩正交化方法，利用梯度低秩特性；构建低秩矩阵符号梯度下降算法；开发低秩Muon变体。

Result: 数值实验显示低秩正交化性能优越，低秩Muon在GPT-2和LLaMA预训练中超越了精心调优的原版Muon。

Conclusion: 理论上建立了低秩矩阵符号梯度下降的迭代复杂度，以及在重尾噪声下低秩Muon寻找近似随机平稳解的迭代复杂度。

Abstract: Neural network (NN) training is inherently a large-scale matrix optimization
problem, yet the matrix structure of NN parameters has long been overlooked.
Recently, the optimizer Muon \cite{jordanmuon}, which explicitly exploits this
structure, has gained significant attention for its strong performance in
foundation model training. A key component contributing to Muon's success is
matrix orthogonalization. In this paper, we propose {\it low-rank
orthogonalization}, which explicitly leverages the low-rank nature of gradients
during NN training. Building on this, we propose low-rank matrix-signed
gradient descent and a low-rank variant of Muon. Our numerical experiments
demonstrate the superior performance of low-rank orthogonalization, with the
low-rank Muon achieving promising results in GPT-2 and LLaMA pretraining --
surpassing the performance of the carefully tuned vanilla Muon. Theoretically,
we establish the iteration complexity of the low-rank matrix-signed gradient
descent for finding an approximate stationary solution, as well as that of
low-rank Muon for finding an approximate stochastic stationary solution under
heavy-tailed noise.

Result: 理论证明估计器达到统计最优参数收敛率；在基准和真实数据集上的实验显示优于传统相似性方法

Conclusion: USimUL框架有效解决了相似性学习中的隐私泄露问题，同时保持了优越的分类性能

Abstract: Existing similarity-based weakly supervised learning approaches often rely on
precise similarity annotations between data pairs, which may inadvertently
expose sensitive label information and raise privacy risks. To mitigate this
issue, we propose Uncertain Similarity and Unlabeled Learning (USimUL), a novel
framework where each similarity pair is embedded with an uncertainty component
to reduce label leakage. In this paper, we propose an unbiased risk estimator
that learns from uncertain similarity and unlabeled data. Additionally, we
theoretically prove that the estimator achieves statistically optimal
parametric convergence rates. Extensive experiments on both benchmark and
real-world datasets show that our method achieves superior classification
performance compared to conventional similarity-based approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 逆强化学习(IRL)存在固有的不适定性，多个奖励函数可以解释相同的专家行为。在新环境中，这些不同的奖励函数可能产生不同的策略，需要决策标准来选择部署哪个策略。

Method: 提出选择可行奖励集合有界子集中奖励诱导策略的"平均"策略作为决策标准。证明该策略可以通过计算该子集奖励质心的规划获得，并推导出闭式表达式。开发了仅使用专家演示离线数据集高效估计质心的算法。

Conclusion: 该方法为IRL中的策略选择问题提供了原则性解决方案，通过奖励质心规划获得平均策略，具有理论保证和实际可行性。

Abstract: We study the problem of generalizing an expert agent's behavior, provided
through demonstrations, to new environments and/or additional constraints.
Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) offers a promising solution by seeking to
recover the expert's underlying reward function, which, if used for planning in
the new settings, would reproduce the desired behavior. However, IRL is
inherently ill-posed: multiple reward functions, forming the so-called feasible
set, can explain the same observed behavior. Since these rewards may induce
different policies in the new setting, in the absence of additional
information, a decision criterion is needed to select which policy to deploy.
In this paper, we propose a novel, principled criterion that selects the
"average" policy among those induced by the rewards in a certain bounded subset
of the feasible set. Remarkably, we show that this policy can be obtained by
planning with the reward centroid of that subset, for which we derive a
closed-form expression. We then present a provably efficient algorithm for
estimating this centroid using an offline dataset of expert demonstrations
only. Finally, we conduct numerical simulations that illustrate the
relationship between the expert's behavior and the behavior produced by our
method.

Motivation: 为了在严格内存限制下部署大型语言模型，需要找到最佳性能的量化配置，但组合搜索空间巨大（超过10^100种可能），传统黑盒优化方法不可行。

Method: 采用四重创新：(1)基于先验知识的搜索空间剪枝，(2)量化代理绕过格式转换，(3)质量预测器减少评估开销，(4)迭代搜索更新策略实现快速稳定收敛。

Result: AMQ能够高效探索质量-效率权衡空间，达到帕累托前沿，产生既紧凑又高性能的LLM模型。

Conclusion: AMQ框架成功解决了大规模量化配置搜索的挑战，为内存受限环境下的LLM部署提供了有效的自动化解决方案。

Abstract: To enable broader deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs), it is essential
to identify the best-performing model under strict memory constraints. We
present AMQ, Automated Mixed-Precision Weight-Only Quantization, a framework
that assigns layer-wise quantization bit-widths to optimally balance model
quality and memory usage. However, the combinatorial search space, with over
10^{100} possible configurations, makes conventional black-box optimization
infeasible. AMQ overcomes this challenge through four key innovations:(1)
search space pruning using prior knowledge to exclude unpromising
configurations, (2) quantization proxy to bypass costly format conversions
during search, (3) quality predictor to minimize evaluation overhead, and (4)
iterative search-and-update strategy for fast and stable convergence. By
integrating these components, AMQ efficiently explores the quality-efficiency
landscape, reaching the Pareto frontier and yielding LLMs that are both compact
and high-performing. Our code is available at https://github.com/dlwns147/amq.

Motivation: 传统神经常微分方程假设系统是马尔可夫的，但实际应用中很多动力学系统存在延迟和记忆效应，需要考虑历史状态。RNN编码器存在离散性和训练困难的问题。

Method: 采用签名变换作为编码器，它能够在连续时间中有效总结多维信息。将签名基于编码方案集成到编码器-解码器动力学模型中。

Result: 在合成标准测试中，签名编码方法在测试性能上超过了RNN基础的替代方案。

Conclusion: 签名变换提供了一种有效的连续时间编码方案，能够更好地处理非马尔可夫动力学系统中的历史依赖性问题。

Abstract: Neural ordinary differential equations offer an effective framework for
modeling dynamical systems by learning a continuous-time vector field. However,
they rely on the Markovian assumption - that future states depend only on the
current state - which is often untrue in real-world scenarios where the
dynamics may depend on the history of past states. This limitation becomes
especially evident in settings involving the continuous control of complex
systems with delays and memory effects. To capture historical dependencies,
existing approaches often rely on recurrent neural network (RNN)-based
encoders, which are inherently discrete and struggle with continuous modeling.
In addition, they may exhibit poor training behavior. In this work, we
investigate the use of the signature transform as an encoder for learning
non-Markovian dynamics in a continuous-time setting. The signature transform
offers a continuous-time alternative with strong theoretical foundations and
proven efficiency in summarizing multidimensional information in time. We
integrate a signature-based encoding scheme into encoder-decoder dynamics
models and demonstrate that it outperforms RNN-based alternatives in test
performance on synthetic benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模仿学习只关注匹配专家的期望收益（平均性能），而忽略了风险态度（收益分布的其他特征如方差）。这个研究的动机是为了训练一个既能匹配专家平均性能又能匹配其风险偏好的风险敏感强化学习代理。

Method: 提出了一种普遍的风险敏感模仿学习问题形式，目标是在Wasserstein距离下匹配专家的收益分布。重点研究表格设置下的问题，首先证明了马尔可夫策略在这个任务中的表达能力有限，然后引入了一个高效且充分表达的非马尔可夫策略子类。基于此开发了两种算法：RS-BC（过渡模型未知）和RS-KT（过渡模型已知）。

Result: 证明了RS-KT通过利用动力学信息获得了较RS-BC更低的样本复杂度。还设计了一种基于oracle的RS-KT变种来处理专家奖励未知的情况，并通过数值模拟验证了算法的样本效率以及非马尔可夫策略类比标准高效模仿学习算法的优势。

Conclusion: 这个研究为风险敏感模仿学习提供了一个理论基础和实用的解决方案。所提出的非马尔可夫策略类和RS-KT/RS-BC算法能够高效地学习专家的风险态度，且在样本效率方面表现优异。这为强化学习领域的风险管理和偏好学习提供了重要的技术支持。

Abstract: We study the problem of training a risk-sensitive reinforcement learning (RL)
agent through imitation learning (IL). Unlike standard IL, our goal is not only
to train an agent that matches the expert's expected return (i.e., its average
performance) but also its risk attitude (i.e., other features of the return
distribution, such as variance). We propose a general formulation of the
risk-sensitive IL problem in which the objective is to match the expert's
return distribution in Wasserstein distance. We focus on the tabular setting
and assume the expert's reward is known. After demonstrating the limited
expressivity of Markovian policies for this task, we introduce an efficient and
sufficiently expressive subclass of non-Markovian policies tailored to it.
Building on this subclass, we develop two provably efficient algorithms, RS-BC
and RS-KT, for solving the problem when the transition model is unknown and
known, respectively. We show that RS-KT achieves substantially lower sample
complexity than RS-BC by exploiting dynamics information. We further
demonstrate the sample efficiency of return distribution matching in the
setting where the expert's reward is unknown by designing an oracle-based
variant of RS-KT. Finally, we complement our theoretical analysis of RS-KT and
RS-BC with numerical simulations, highlighting both their sample efficiency and
the advantages of non-Markovian policies over standard sample-efficient IL
algorithms.

Conclusion: 该研究提出的方法能够有效地处理交通流的随机性和变化的环境条件，提供了更准确的预测和可靠的不确定性量化，为交通管理系统提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Traffic flow forecasting is essential for managing congestion, improving
safety, and optimizing various transportation systems. However, it remains a
prevailing challenge due to the stochastic nature of urban traffic and
environmental factors. Better predictions require models capable of
accommodating the traffic variability influenced by multiple dynamic and
complex interdependent factors. In this work, we propose a Graph Neural Network
(GNN) framework to address the stochasticity by leveraging adaptive adjacency
matrices using log-normal distributions and Coefficient of Variation (CV)
values to reflect real-world travel time variability. Additionally, weather
factors such as temperature, wind speed, and precipitation adjust edge weights
and enable GNN to capture evolving spatio-temporal dependencies across traffic
stations. This enhancement over the static adjacency matrix allows the model to
adapt effectively to traffic stochasticity and changing environmental
conditions. Furthermore, we utilize the Adaptive Conformal Prediction (ACP)
framework to provide reliable uncertainty quantification, achieving target
coverage while maintaining acceptable prediction intervals. Experimental
results demonstrate that the proposed model, in comparison with baseline
methods, showed better prediction accuracy and uncertainty bounds. We, then,
validate this method by constructing traffic scenarios in SUMO and applying
Monte-Carlo simulation to derive a travel time distribution for a Vehicle Under
Test (VUT) to reflect real-world variability. The simulated mean travel time of
the VUT falls within the intervals defined by INRIX historical data, verifying
the model's robustness.

Conclusion: HODT算法成功解决了超曲面决策树的最优化问题，在准确性和鲁棒性方面均优于现有方法，为决策树模型提供了更强大的表达能力。

Abstract: Decision trees are a ubiquitous model for classification and regression tasks
due to their interpretability and efficiency. However, solving the optimal
decision tree (ODT) problem remains a challenging combinatorial optimization
task. Even for the simplest splitting rules--axis-parallel hyperplanes--it is
NP-hard to optimize. In Part I of this series, we rigorously defined the proper
decision tree model through four axioms and, based on these, introduced four
formal definitions of the ODT problem. From these definitions, we derived four
generic algorithms capable of solving ODT problems for arbitrary decision trees
satisfying the axioms. We also analyzed the combinatorial geometric properties
of hypersurfaces, showing that decision trees defined by polynomial
hypersurface splitting rules satisfy the proper axioms that we proposed.
  In this second paper (Part II) of this two-part series, building on the
algorithmic and geometric foundations established in Part I, we introduce the
first hypersurface decision tree (HODT) algorithm. To the best of our
knowledge, existing optimal decision tree methods are, to date, limited to
hyperplane splitting rules--a special case of hypersurfaces--and rely on
general-purpose solvers. In contrast, our HODT algorithm addresses the general
hypersurface decision tree model without requiring external solvers.
  Using synthetic datasets generated from ground-truth hyperplane decision
trees, we vary tree size, data size, dimensionality, and label and feature
noise. Results showing that our algorithm recovers the ground truth more
accurately than axis-parallel trees and exhibits greater robustness to noise.
We also analyzed generalization performance across 30 real-world datasets,
showing that HODT can achieve up to 30% higher accuracy than the
state-of-the-art optimal axis-parallel decision tree algorithm when tree
complexity is properly controlled.

Conclusion: 近端感知统系结合集成学习能够在叶层症状显现前实时检测分支独金鹿，支持目标干预和减少产量损失

Abstract: Branched broomrape (Phelipanche ramosa) is a chlorophyll-deficient parasitic
weed that threatens tomato production by extracting nutrients from the host. We
investigate early detection using leaf-level spectral reflectance (400-2500 nm)
and ensemble machine learning. In a field experiment in Woodland, California,
we tracked 300 tomato plants across growth stages defined by growing degree
days (GDD). Leaf reflectance was acquired with a portable spectrometer and
preprocessed (band denoising, 1 nm interpolation, Savitzky-Golay smoothing,
correlation-based band reduction). Clear class differences were observed near
1500 nm and 2000 nm water absorption features, consistent with reduced leaf
water content in infected plants at early stages. An ensemble combining Random
Forest, XGBoost, SVM with RBF kernel, and Naive Bayes achieved 89% accuracy at
585 GDD, with recalls of 0.86 (infected) and 0.93 (noninfected). Accuracy
declined at later stages (e.g., 69% at 1568 GDD), likely due to senescence and
weed interference. Despite the small number of infected plants and
environmental confounders, results show that proximal sensing with ensemble
learning enables timely detection of broomrape before canopy symptoms are
visible, supporting targeted interventions and reduced yield losses.

which can be efficiently processed by exploiting advanced deep learning
technologies. Computationally, these patches further serve as tokens for
learning a self-attention encoder, thus enabling accurate prediction of
nonlinear time-series by a finite-dimensional Koopman operator in a linear
manner in a latent space. Extensive evaluations across various benchmarks and
real-world climate datasets demonstrate over 20% average reduction in mean
squared error versus state-of-the-art foundation models, alongside superior
generalization in fine-tuning scenarios. In particular, the learned dynamical
representations and Koopman operator prediction forms from the patches exhibit
exceptional interpretability, with consistent identification of topologically
informative subspaces and robust encoding of domain-invariant dynamics,
establishing UDE as a scalable, interpretable framework for universal
time-series modeling and forecasting with broad scientific and industrial
applicability.

*Tianqi Zhao,Russa Biswas,Megha Khosla*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NodePro是一个节点分析框架，通过为单个节点分配可解释的配置文件分数，实现细粒度模型行为诊断，揭示即使总体性能相似时模型在节点级别的系统性差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图机器学习模型虽然总体性能相似，但在节点级别的行为表现不同，标准评估指标无法捕捉这些细粒度差异，难以诊断模型何时何地失败。

Method: NodePro结合数据中心的信号（特征差异、标签不确定性、结构模糊性）和模型中心的度量（预测置信度、训练一致性），为节点分配可解释的配置文件分数。

Result: NodePro能够揭示模型之间的系统性差异，即使聚合指标无法区分；节点配置文件可泛化到未见节点，支持无真实标签的预测可靠性评估；在结构化知识图谱中有效识别语义不一致或损坏的节点。

Conclusion: NodePro提供了一个有效的细粒度诊断框架，能够深入理解图模型在节点级别的行为差异，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Graph machine learning models often achieve similar overall performance yet
behave differently at the node level, failing on different subsets of nodes
with varying reliability. Standard evaluation metrics such as accuracy obscure
these fine grained differences, making it difficult to diagnose when and where
models fail. We introduce NodePro, a node profiling framework that enables
fine-grained diagnosis of model behavior by assigning interpretable profile
scores to individual nodes. These scores combine data-centric signals, such as
feature dissimilarity, label uncertainty, and structural ambiguity, with
model-centric measures of prediction confidence and consistency during
training. By aligning model behavior with these profiles, NodePro reveals
systematic differences between models, even when aggregate metrics are
indistinguishable. We show that node profiles generalize to unseen nodes,
supporting prediction reliability without ground-truth labels. Finally, we
demonstrate the utility of NodePro in identifying semantically inconsistent or
corrupted nodes in a structured knowledge graph, illustrating its effectiveness
in real-world settings.

*Aryaman Reddi,Gabriele Tiboni,Jan Peters,Carlo D'Eramo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: K-Level Policy Gradient (KPG) 是一种多智能体强化学习方法，通过递归更新智能体策略来解决传统方法中的协调问题，在理论和实验上都表现出优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的actor-critic多智能体强化学习方法在策略更新时只考虑其他智能体的当前策略，而不考虑它们在同一更新步骤中的变化，这会导致协调失败和效率低下。

Method: 提出K-Level Policy Gradient (KPG)方法，递归地更新每个智能体相对于其他智能体更新后策略的策略，加速有效协调策略的发现。将KPG应用于MAPPO、MADDPG和FACMAC等深度MARL算法。

Result: 理论证明KPG在有限迭代次数下能够单调收敛到局部纳什均衡。在StarCraft II和多智能体MuJoCo实验中，KPG表现出优于现有深度MARL算法的性能。

Conclusion: KPG方法通过递归策略更新有效解决了多智能体协调问题，在理论和实验上都验证了其优越性，为深度多智能体强化学习提供了新的有效解决方案。

Abstract: Actor-critic algorithms for deep multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)
typically employ a policy update that responds to the current strategies of
other agents. While being straightforward, this approach does not account for
the updates of other agents at the same update step, resulting in
miscoordination. In this paper, we introduce the $K$-Level Policy Gradient
(KPG), a method that recursively updates each agent against the updated
policies of other agents, speeding up the discovery of effective coordinated
policies. We theoretically prove that KPG with finite iterates achieves
monotonic convergence to a local Nash equilibrium under certain conditions. We
provide principled implementations of KPG by applying it to the deep MARL
algorithms MAPPO, MADDPG, and FACMAC. Empirically, we demonstrate superior
performance over existing deep MARL algorithms in StarCraft II and multi-agent
MuJoCo.

Conclusion: 这些发现强调了建立健壮评估框架的重要性，并为指导机器学习在气候风险预测中的可靠应用提供了可操作的见解。

Abstract: Climate change is accelerating the frequency and severity of unprecedented
events, deviating from established patterns. Predicting these
out-of-distribution (OOD) events is critical for assessing risks and guiding
climate adaptation. While machine learning (ML) models have shown promise in
providing precise, high-speed climate predictions, their ability to generalize
under distribution shifts remains a significant limitation that has been
underexplored in climate contexts. This research systematically evaluates
state-of-the-art ML-based climate models in diverse OOD scenarios by adapting
established OOD evaluation methodologies to climate data. Experiments on
large-scale datasets reveal notable performance variability across scenarios,
shedding light on the strengths and limitations of current models. These
findings underscore the importance of robust evaluation frameworks and provide
actionable insights to guide the reliable application of ML for climate risk
forecasting.

Conclusion: 对梯度流在鞍点附近行为的理论分析为开发新的训练算法提供了基础，Neuron Pursuit算法展示了通过逐步扩展网络结构的有效性

Abstract: The first part of this paper studies the evolution of gradient flow for
homogeneous neural networks near a class of saddle points exhibiting a sparsity
structure. The choice of these saddle points is motivated from previous works
on homogeneous networks, which identified the first saddle point encountered by
gradient flow after escaping the origin. It is shown here that, when
initialized sufficiently close to such saddle points, gradient flow remains
near the saddle point for a sufficiently long time, during which the set of
weights with small norm remain small but converge in direction. Furthermore,
important empirical observations are made on the behavior of gradient descent
after escaping these saddle points. The second part of the paper, motivated by
these results, introduces a greedy algorithm to train deep neural networks
called Neuron Pursuit (NP). It is an iterative procedure which alternates
between expanding the network by adding neuron(s) with carefully chosen
weights, and minimizing the training loss using this augmented network. The
efficacy of the proposed algorithm is validated using numerical experiments.

Abstract: Human face synthesis and manipulation are increasingly important in
entertainment and AI, with a growing demand for highly realistic,
identity-preserving images even when only unpaired, unaligned datasets are
available. We study unpaired face manipulation via adversarial learning, moving
from autoencoder baselines to a robust, guided CycleGAN framework. While
autoencoders capture coarse identity, they often miss fine details. Our
approach integrates spectral normalization for stable training, identity- and
perceptual-guided losses to preserve subject identity and high-level structure,
and landmark-weighted cycle constraints to maintain facial geometry across pose
and illumination changes. Experiments show that our adversarial trained
CycleGAN improves realism (FID), perceptual quality (LPIPS), and identity
preservation (ID-Sim) over autoencoders, with competitive cycle-reconstruction
SSIM and practical inference times, which achieved high quality without paired
datasets and approaching pix2pix on curated paired subsets. These results
demonstrate that guided, spectrally normalized CycleGANs provide a practical
path from autoencoders to robust unpaired face manipulation.

Abstract: Generative models for materials, especially inorganic crystals, hold
potential to transform the theoretical prediction of novel compounds and
structures. Advancement in this field depends critically on robust benchmarks
and minimal, information-rich datasets that enable meaningful model evaluation.
This paper critically examines common datasets and reported metrics for a
crystal structure prediction task$\unicode{x2014}$generating the most likely
structures given the chemical composition of a material. We focus on three key
issues: First, materials datasets should contain unique crystal structures; for
example, we show that the widely-utilized carbon-24 dataset only contains
$\approx$40% unique structures. Second, materials datasets should not be split
randomly if polymorphs of many different compositions are numerous, which we
find to be the case for the perov-5 dataset. Third, benchmarks can mislead if
used uncritically, e.g., reporting a match rate metric without considering the
structural variety exhibited by identical building blocks. To address these
oft-overlooked issues, we introduce several fixes. We provide revised versions
of the carbon-24 dataset: one with duplicates removed, one deduplicated and
split by number of atoms $N$, and two containing only identical structures but
with different unit cells. We also propose a new split for the perov-5 dataset
which ensures polymorphs are grouped within each split subset, setting a more
sensible standard for benchmarking model performance. Finally, we present METRe
and cRMSE, new model evaluation metrics that can correct existing issues with
the match rate metric.

Abstract: The study of neural representations, both in biological and artificial
systems, is increasingly revealing the importance of geometric and topological
structures. Inspired by this, we introduce Event2Vec, a novel framework for
learning representations of discrete event sequences. Our model leverages a
simple, additive recurrent structure to learn composable, interpretable
embeddings. We provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating that, under
specific training objectives, our model's learned representations in a
Euclidean space converge to an ideal additive structure. This ensures that the
representation of a sequence is the vector sum of its constituent events, a
property we term the linear additive hypothesis. To address the limitations of
Euclidean geometry for hierarchical data, we also introduce a variant of our
model in hyperbolic space, which is naturally suited to embedding tree-like
structures with low distortion. We present experiments to validate our
hypothesis and demonstrate the benefits of each geometry, highlighting the
improved performance of the hyperbolic model on hierarchical event sequences.

### [351] [Dynamic Relational Priming Improves Transformer in Multivariate Time Series](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12196)
*Hunjae Lee,Corey Clark*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了prime attention机制，通过动态调整token表示来更好地捕捉多元时间序列中异构的通道间依赖关系，相比标准attention在预测精度上提升6.5%，且可用更短的序列长度达到相当或更好的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准attention机制使用静态token表示，无法有效捕捉多元时间序列数据中不同通道对之间可能由完全不同的物理定律或时间动态支配的异构依赖关系。

Method: 提出动态关系启动注意力机制(prime attention)，通过可学习的调制参数为每个token对动态定制表示，优化特定关系的成对交互，同时保持与标准attention相同的渐近计算复杂度。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，prime attention consistently优于标准attention，预测精度提升达6.5%，且使用比标准attention少40%的序列长度就能达到相当或更好的性能。

Conclusion: prime attention通过表示可塑性有效提取多元时间序列中关系特定的信息，展现出优越的关系建模能力，为处理异构依赖关系提供了更有效的注意力机制。

Abstract: Standard attention mechanisms in transformers employ static token
representations that remain unchanged across all pair-wise computations in each
layer. This limits their representational alignment with the potentially
diverse relational dynamics of each token-pair interaction. While they excel in
domains with relatively homogeneous relationships, standard attention's static
relational learning struggles to capture the diverse, heterogeneous
inter-channel dependencies of multivariate time series (MTS) data--where
different channel-pair interactions within a single system may be governed by
entirely different physical laws or temporal dynamics. To better align the
attention mechanism for such domain phenomena, we propose attention with
dynamic relational priming (prime attention). Unlike standard attention where
each token presents an identical representation across all of its pair-wise
interactions, prime attention tailors each token dynamically (or per
interaction) through learnable modulations to best capture the unique
relational dynamics of each token pair, optimizing each pair-wise interaction
for that specific relationship. This representational plasticity of prime
attention enables effective extraction of relationship-specific information in
MTS while maintaining the same asymptotic computational complexity as standard
attention. Our results demonstrate that prime attention consistently
outperforms standard attention across benchmarks, achieving up to 6.5\%
improvement in forecasting accuracy. In addition, we find that prime attention
achieves comparable or superior performance using up to 40\% less sequence
length compared to standard attention, further demonstrating its superior
relational modeling capabilities.
