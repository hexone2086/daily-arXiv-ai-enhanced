*Khartik Uppalapati,Bora Yimenicioglu,Shakeel Abdulkareem,Adan Eftekhari,Bhavya Uppalapati,Viraj Kamath*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出TinyViT-Batten框架，使用少量样本的Vision Transformer从儿科脑部MRI中检测早期Batten病，在79例确诊患者和90例对照数据上达到约91%准确率和0.95以上AUC。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Batten病是一种罕见的儿科神经退行性疾病，早期MRI征象细微且常被忽略，需要开发能够从有限训练样本中检测早期疾病的AI解决方案。

Method: 将大型教师ViT蒸馏为5M参数的TinyViT，使用基于度量的少样本学习（原型损失，5样本片段）进行微调，并集成Grad-CAM实现可解释预测。

Result: 在多中心数据集上达到高准确率（约91%）和ROC曲线下面积（至少0.95），优于3D-ResNet和Swin-Tiny基线，灵敏度大于90%，特异性约90%。

Conclusion: 模型的小尺寸和强性能展示了用于早期Batten病检测的实用AI解决方案，通过Grad-CAM提供可解释的疾病相关脑区定位。

Abstract: Batten disease (neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis) is a rare pediatric
neurodegenerative disorder whose early MRI signs are subtle and often missed.
We propose TinyViT-Batten, a few-shot Vision Transformer (ViT) framework to
detect early Batten disease from pediatric brain MRI with limited training
cases. We distill a large teacher ViT into a 5 M-parameter TinyViT and
fine-tune it using metric-based few-shot learning (prototypical loss with
5-shot episodes). Our model achieves high accuracy (approximately 91%) and area
under ROC of at least 0.95 on a multi-site dataset of 79 genetically confirmed
Batten-disease MRIs (27 CLN3 from the Hochstein natural-history study, 32 CLN2
from an international longitudinal cohort, 12 early-manifestation CLN2 cases
reported by Cokal et al., and 8 public Radiopaedia scans) together with 90
age-matched controls, outperforming a 3D-ResNet and Swin-Tiny baseline. We
further integrate Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) to
highlight disease-relevant brain regions, enabling explainable predictions. The
model's small size and strong performance (sensitivity greater than 90%,
specificity approximately 90%) demonstrates a practical AI solution for early
Batten disease detection.

Abstract: Within the domain of medical image analysis, three distinct methodologies
have demonstrated commendable accuracy: Neural Networks, Decision Trees, and
Ensemble-Based Learning Algorithms, particularly in the specialized context of
genstro institutional track abnormalities detection. These approaches exhibit
efficacy in disease detection scenarios where a substantial volume of data is
available. However, the prevalent challenge in medical image analysis pertains
to limited data availability and data confidence. This paper introduces
TreeNet, a novel layered decision ensemble learning methodology tailored for
medical image analysis. Constructed by integrating pivotal features from neural
networks, ensemble learning, and tree-based decision models, TreeNet emerges as
a potent and adaptable model capable of delivering superior performance across
diverse and intricate machine learning tasks. Furthermore, its interpretability
and insightful decision-making process enhance its applicability in complex
medical scenarios. Evaluation of the proposed approach encompasses key metrics
including Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and training and evaluation time. The
methodology resulted in an F1-score of up to 0.85 when using the complete
training data, with an F1-score of 0.77 when utilizing 50\% of the training
data. This shows a reduction of F1-score of 0.08 while in the reduction of 50\%
of the training data and training time. The evaluation of the methodology
resulted in the 32 Frame per Second which is usable for the realtime
applications. This comprehensive assessment underscores the efficiency and
usability of TreeNet in the demanding landscape of medical image analysis
specially in the realtime analysis.

### [4] [OmniSAT: Compact Action Token, Faster Auto Regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09667)
*Huaihai Lyu,Chaofan Chen,Senwei Xie,Pengwei Wang,Xiansheng Chen,Shanghang Zhang,Changsheng Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了Omni Swift Action Tokenizer (OmniSAT)，通过B样条编码和多阶段残差量化技术，将高维连续动作序列压缩为紧凑的离散令牌表示，显著缩短训练序列长度并降低目标熵，同时保持重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自回归VLA模型在处理长序列和高维动作时效率低下，而现有的压缩方法存在重建质量差或压缩效率低的问题。

Method: 首先对值范围和时间范围进行归一化，使用B样条编码获得一致表示，然后对位置、旋转和夹爪子空间应用多阶段残差量化，生成具有粗到细粒度的压缩离散令牌。

Result: 在Droid大规模数据集上预训练后，离散令牌化将训练序列缩短6.8倍，降低目标熵，在多样化的真实机器人和仿真实验中表现出更高的压缩率和更好的重建质量。

Conclusion: OmniSAT在保持重建质量的同时实现了高效压缩，加快了自回归训练收敛速度并提升了模型性能，还支持跨具身学习的统一动作模式空间。

Abstract: Existing Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models can be broadly categorized into
diffusion-based and auto-regressive (AR) approaches: diffusion models capture
continuous action distributions but rely on computationally heavy iterative
denoising. In contrast, AR models enable efficient optimization and flexible
sequence construction, making them better suited for large-scale pretraining.
To further improve AR efficiency, particularly when action chunks induce
extended and high-dimensional sequences, prior work applies entropy-guided and
token-frequency techniques to shorten the sequence length. However, such
compression struggled with \textit{poor reconstruction or inefficient
compression}. Motivated by this, we introduce an Omni Swift Action Tokenizer,
which learns a compact, transferable action representation. Specifically, we
first normalize value ranges and temporal horizons to obtain a consistent
representation with B-Spline encoding. Then, we apply multi-stage residual
quantization to the position, rotation, and gripper subspaces, producing
compressed discrete tokens with coarse-to-fine granularity for each part. After
pre-training on the large-scale dataset Droid, the resulting discrete
tokenization shortens the training sequence by 6.8$\times$, and lowers the
target entropy. To further explore the potential of OmniSAT, we develop a
cross-embodiment learning strategy that builds on the unified action-pattern
space and jointly leverages robot and human demonstrations. It enables scalable
auxiliary supervision from heterogeneous egocentric videos. Across diverse
real-robot and simulation experiments, OmniSAT encompasses higher compression
while preserving reconstruction quality, enabling faster AR training
convergence and model performance.

### [5] [Knowledge-Aware Mamba for Joint Change Detection and Classification from MODIS Times Series](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09679)
*Zhengsen Xu,Yimin Zhu,Zack Dewis,Mabel Heffring,Motasem Alkayid,Saeid Taleghanidoozdoozan,Lincoln Linlin Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为KAMamba的新方法，用于改进MODIS时间序列变化检测，通过知识驱动的转换矩阵、多任务学习和时空谱Mamba模块来解决MODIS数据中的混合像素和信息耦合问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MODIS时间序列变化检测面临混合像素、空间-光谱-时间信息耦合效应和背景类别异质性等关键挑战，需要新的方法来提高检测精度。

Method: 设计了知识驱动的转换矩阵引导方法（KAT-loss）、多任务学习方法（PreC-loss、PostC-loss、Chg-loss）、空间-光谱-时间Mamba模块（SSTMamba）和稀疏可变形Mamba骨干网络（SDMamba）。

Result: 在加拿大萨斯喀彻温省的MODIS时间序列数据集上，变化检测的平均F1得分比基线方法提高了约1.5-6%，LULC分类的OA、AA和Kappa指标提高了约2%。

Conclusion: KAMamba方法有效解决了MODIS变化检测中的关键挑战，在变化检测和土地覆盖分类任务上都取得了显著改进。

Abstract: Although change detection using MODIS time series is critical for
environmental monitoring, it is a highly challenging task due to key MODIS
difficulties, e.g., mixed pixels, spatial-spectral-temporal information
coupling effect, and background class heterogeneity. This paper presents a
novel knowledge-aware Mamba (KAMamba) for enhanced MODIS change detection, with
the following contributions. First, to leverage knowledge regarding class
transitions, we design a novel knowledge-driven transition-matrix-guided
approach, leading to a knowledge-aware transition loss (KAT-loss) that can
enhance detection accuracies. Second, to improve model constraints, a
multi-task learning approach is designed, where three losses, i.e., pre-change
classification loss (PreC-loss), post-change classification loss (PostC-loss),
and change detection loss (Chg-loss) are used for improve model learning.
Third, to disentangle information coupling in MODIS time series, novel
spatial-spectral-temporal Mamba (SSTMamba) modules are designed. Last, to
improve Mamba model efficiency and remove computational cost, a sparse and
deformable Mamba (SDMamba) backbone is used in SSTMamba. On the MODIS
time-series dataset for Saskatchewan, Canada, we evaluate the method on
land-cover change detection and LULC classification; results show about 1.5-6%
gains in average F1 for change detection over baselines, and about 2%
improvements in OA, AA, and Kappa for LULC classification.

### [6] [NNDM: NN_UNet Diffusion Model for Brain Tumor Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09681)
*Sashank Makanaboyina*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出NNDM混合框架，结合NN-UNet和扩散模型，通过迭代去噪过程改进脑肿瘤分割精度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CNN模型如U-Net在泛化性、边界精度和数据多样性方面存在不足，需要更精确的脑肿瘤分割方法

Method: 集成NN-UNet的稳健特征提取与扩散概率模型的生成能力，通过扩散模型学习预测与真实分割掩码之间的残差误差分布

Result: 在BraTS 2021数据集上，NNDM相比传统U-Net和基于transformer的基线方法表现更优，Dice系数和Hausdorff距离指标均有提升

Conclusion: NNDM为结合确定性分割网络与随机扩散模型开辟了新方向，推进了自动脑肿瘤分析的技术水平

Abstract: Accurate detection and segmentation of brain tumors in magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) are critical for effective diagnosis and treatment planning.
Despite advances in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) such as U-Net,
existing models often struggle with generalization, boundary precision, and
limited data diversity. To address these challenges, we propose NNDM (NN\_UNet
Diffusion Model)a hybrid framework that integrates the robust feature
extraction of NN-UNet with the generative capabilities of diffusion
probabilistic models. In our approach, the diffusion model progressively
refines the segmentation masks generated by NN-UNet by learning the residual
error distribution between predicted and ground-truth masks. This iterative
denoising process enables the model to correct fine structural inconsistencies
and enhance tumor boundary delineation. Experiments conducted on the BraTS 2021
datasets demonstrate that NNDM achieves superior performance compared to
conventional U-Net and transformer-based baselines, yielding improvements in
Dice coefficient and Hausdorff distance metrics. Moreover, the diffusion-guided
refinement enhances robustness across modalities and tumor subregions. The
proposed NNDM establishes a new direction for combining deterministic
segmentation networks with stochastic diffusion models, advancing the state of
the art in automated brain tumor analysis.

*Thi Bich Phuong Man,Luu Tu Nguyen,Vu Tram Anh Khuong,Thanh Ha Le,Thi Duyen Ngo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种新的微表情识别方法，包含两种互补表示（时间排序动态图像和运动强度动态图像）以及自适应融合网络，在多个基准数据集上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微表情具有极低强度且难以被肉眼察觉，但在测谎、行为分析和心理评估中具有重要价值，需要开发有效的识别方法。

Method: 提出两种互补表示：时间排序动态图像强调时间进程，运动强度动态图像通过帧重排序机制突出细微运动；设计自适应融合网络自动学习最优融合策略。

Result: 在CASME-II数据集上达到93.95%准确率和0.897 UF1，在SAMM数据集上达到82.47%准确率和0.665 UF1，在MMEW数据集上达到76.00%准确率，均表现出优异性能。

Conclusion: 所提出的输入表示和网络架构在提升微表情识别性能中发挥重要作用，为情感计算、测谎和人机交互领域的进一步研究和应用奠定基础。

Abstract: Micro-expressions (MEs) are subtle, transient facial changes with very low
intensity, almost imperceptible to the naked eye, yet they reveal a person
genuine emotion. They are of great value in lie detection, behavioral analysis,
and psychological assessment. This paper proposes a novel MER method with two
main contributions. First, we propose two complementary representations -
Temporal-ranked dynamic image, which emphasizes temporal progression, and
Motion-intensity dynamic image, which highlights subtle motions through a frame
reordering mechanism incorporating motion intensity. Second, we propose an
Adaptive fusion network, which automatically learns to optimally integrate
these two representations, thereby enhancing discriminative ME features while
suppressing noise. Experiments on three benchmark datasets (CASME-II, SAMM and
MMEW) demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method. Specifically, AFN
achieves 93.95 Accuracy and 0.897 UF1 on CASME-II, setting a new
state-of-the-art benchmark. On SAMM, the method attains 82.47 Accuracy and
0.665 UF1, demonstrating more balanced recognition across classes. On MMEW, the
model achieves 76.00 Accuracy, further confirming its generalization ability.
The obtained results show that both the input and the proposed architecture
play important roles in improving the performance of MER. Moreover, they
provide a solid foundation for further research and practical applications in
the fields of affective computing, lie detection, and human-computer
interaction.

Abstract: Connected Vision Systems (CVS) are transforming a variety of applications,
including autonomous vehicles, smart cities, surveillance, and human-robot
interaction. These systems harness multi-view multi-camera (MVMC) data to
provide enhanced situational awareness through the integration of MVMC
tracking, re-identification (Re-ID), and action understanding (AU). However,
deploying CVS in real-world, dynamic environments presents a number of
challenges, particularly in addressing occlusions, diverse viewpoints, and
environmental variability. Existing surveys have focused primarily on isolated
tasks such as tracking, Re-ID, and AU, often neglecting their integration into
a cohesive system. These reviews typically emphasize single-view setups,
overlooking the complexities and opportunities provided by multi-camera
collaboration and multi-view data analysis. To the best of our knowledge, this
survey is the first to offer a comprehensive and integrated review of MVMC that
unifies MVMC tracking, Re-ID, and AU into a single framework. We propose a
unique taxonomy to better understand the critical components of CVS, dividing
it into four key parts: MVMC tracking, Re-ID, AU, and combined methods. We
systematically arrange and summarize the state-of-the-art datasets,
methodologies, results, and evaluation metrics, providing a structured view of
the field's progression. Furthermore, we identify and discuss the open research
questions and challenges, along with emerging technologies such as lifelong
learning, privacy, and federated learning, that need to be addressed for future
advancements. The paper concludes by outlining key research directions for
enhancing the robustness, efficiency, and adaptability of CVS in complex,
real-world applications. We hope this survey will inspire innovative solutions
and guide future research toward the next generation of intelligent and
adaptive CVS.

### [9] [Constructive Distortion: Improving MLLMs with Attention-Guided Image Warping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09741)
*Dwip Dalal,Gautam Vashishtha,Utkarsh Mishra,Jeonghwan Kim,Madhav Kanda,Hyeonjeong Ha,Svetlana Lazebnik,Heng Ji,Unnat Jain*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AttWarp是一种轻量级方法，通过多模态大语言模型的跨模态注意力对输入图像进行线性扭曲，在不改变模型权重或架构的情况下，将空间分辨率重新分配到模型认为重要的区域，从而提升细粒度感知能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在复杂场景中经常忽略小细节和空间关系，导致细粒度感知定位错误。

Method: 使用MLLM的跨模态注意力对输入图像进行线性扭曲，将分辨率重新分配到查询相关的内容区域，同时压缩信息较少的区域，保持全局上下文。

Result: 在五个基准测试和四个MLLM上，AttWarp持续提高准确性，增强组合推理能力，减少幻觉，优于四个竞争基线。

Conclusion: 注意力引导的扭曲能够优先处理与查询相关的信息，同时保持上下文，相同的MLLM在处理扭曲输入时表现更好。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) often miss small details and spatial
relations in cluttered scenes, leading to errors in fine-grained perceptual
grounding. We introduce AttWarp, a lightweight method that allocates more
resolution to query-relevant content while compressing less informative areas,
all while preserving global context. At test time, the approach uses an MLLM's
cross-modal attention to perform rectilinear warping of the input image,
reallocating spatial resolution toward regions the model deems important,
without changing model weights or architecture. This attention-guided warping
preserves all original image information but redistributes it non-uniformly, so
small objects and subtle relationships become easier for the same model to read
while the global layout remains intact. Across five benchmarks (TextVQA, GQA,
DocVQA, POPE, MMMU) and four MLLMs (LLaVA, Qwen-VL, InternVL, and
InstructBLIP), AttWarp consistently improves accuracy, strengthens
compositional reasoning, and reduces hallucinations, outperforming four
competitive baselines that manipulate raw images at test time. Together, these
results show that attention-guided warping prioritizes information relevant to
the query while preserving context, and that the same MLLMs perform better when
given such warped inputs.

Motivation: 探索在多模态语境（图像+文本）中学习外语生词的新方法，理解哪些数据特征和语言背景有助于成功推断生词含义。

Method: 通过人类参与者实验，使用不同的图像-文本对，分析图像和文本特征对推断生词成功率的影响，以及参与者语言背景与成功率的关联。

Result: 发现只有部分直观特征与参与者表现有强相关性，需要进一步研究预测性特征；同时分析了AI系统预测参与者表现的能力。

Conclusion: 揭示了多模态外语学习中的关键影响因素，为改进AI系统推理能力和优化学习材料提供了方向。

Abstract: We investigate a new setting for foreign language learning, where learners
infer the meaning of unfamiliar words in a multimodal context of a sentence
describing a paired image. We conduct studies with human participants using
different image-text pairs. We analyze the features of the data (i.e., images
and texts) that make it easier for participants to infer the meaning of a
masked or unfamiliar word, and what language backgrounds of the participants
correlate with success. We find only some intuitive features have strong
correlations with participant performance, prompting the need for further
investigating of predictive features for success in these tasks. We also
analyze the ability of AI systems to reason about participant performance, and
discover promising future directions for improving this reasoning ability.

*Weiqing Luo,Zhen Tan,Yifan Li,Xinyu Zhao,Kwonjoon Lee,Behzad Dariush,Tianlong Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种自适应分辨率选择方法，通过分析图像复杂度和VLLM不确定性方差来确定不同视觉语言任务的最佳分辨率，并开发了参数高效微调技术来扩展预训练VLLM的视觉输入分辨率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉大语言模型通常假设固定的分辨率用于下游任务，这导致性能不佳。现实世界的视觉语言应用需要不同级别的感知粒度，因此需要根据任务特性自适应选择最佳分辨率。

Method: 首先系统研究不同视觉语言任务的分辨率偏好，发现分辨率偏好与图像复杂度和VLLM不确定性方差相关。基于此提出经验公式确定最佳分辨率，然后开发参数高效微调技术扩展预训练VLLM的视觉输入分辨率。

Result: 在各种视觉语言任务上的广泛实验验证了该方法的有效性，相比固定分辨率方法获得了更好的性能。

Conclusion: 通过自适应分辨率选择和参数高效微调，可以显著提升视觉大语言模型在不同任务上的性能，解决了固定分辨率假设带来的局限性。

Abstract: Real-world vision-language applications demand varying levels of perceptual
granularity. However, most existing visual large language models (VLLMs), such
as LLaVA, pre-assume a fixed resolution for downstream tasks, which leads to
subpar performance. To address this problem, we first conduct a comprehensive
and pioneering investigation into the resolution preferences of different
vision-language tasks, revealing a correlation between resolution preferences
with image complexity, and uncertainty variance of the VLLM at different image
input resolutions. Building on this insight, we propose an empirical formula to
determine the optimal resolution for a given vision-language task, combining
these two factors. Second, based on rigorous experiments, we propose a novel
parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique to extend the visual input resolution
of pre-trained VLLMs to the identified optimal resolution. Extensive
experiments on various vision-language tasks validate the effectiveness of our
method.

TL;DR: 使用合成人脸数据增强单形态攻击检测，通过增量测试协议评估泛化能力，发现适度添加合成数据可改善性能，但仅使用合成数据会导致最差效果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决由于隐私问题导致真实人脸图像数据集规模受限的问题，探索合成数据在形态攻击检测中的应用价值

Method: 采用多种形态生成工具和跨数据集评估方案，实施增量测试协议来评估随着合成图像增加时的泛化能力

Result: 适度控制合成图像数量添加到现有数据集，或在训练中逐步添加真实图像可以改善泛化能力；但无差别使用合成数据会导致次优性能；仅使用合成数据（形态和非形态图像）达到最高的等错误率

Conclusion: 在操作场景中，最佳选择不是仅依赖合成数据进行单形态攻击检测，需要谨慎控制合成数据的使用

Abstract: This paper investigates the use of synthetic face data to enhance
Single-Morphing Attack Detection (S-MAD), addressing the limitations of
availability of large-scale datasets of bona fide images due to privacy
concerns. Various morphing tools and cross-dataset evaluation schemes were
utilized to conduct this study. An incremental testing protocol was implemented
to assess the generalization capabilities as more and more synthetic images
were added. The results of the experiments show that generalization can be
improved by carefully incorporating a controlled number of synthetic images
into existing datasets or by gradually adding bona fide images during training.
However, indiscriminate use of synthetic data can lead to sub-optimal
performance. Evenmore, the use of only synthetic data (morphed and non-morphed
images) achieves the highest Equal Error Rate (EER), which means in operational
scenarios the best option is not relying only on synthetic data for S-MAD.

*Peixian Liang,Yifan Ding,Yizhe Zhang,Jianxu Chen,Hao Zheng,Hongxiao Wang,Yejia Zhang,Guangyu Meng,Tim Weninger,Michael Niemier,X. Sharon Hu,Danny Z Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Ceb的新型像素聚类方法，利用细胞边界特征和标签将前景像素划分为细胞实例，在六个数据集上的实验表明其优于现有像素聚类方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于深度学习的细胞实例分割方法使用像素级目标（如距离图、热扩散图等）可能会丢失细胞实例的重要几何特性（如形状、曲率、凸性），这些特性需要像素集合来表示。

Method: Ceb首先使用改进的Watershed算法提取潜在的前景-前景边界，为每个边界候选构建边界特征表示（边界签名），然后使用边界分类器预测其二元边界标签，最后基于预测的边界标签通过分割或合并相邻区域获得细胞实例。

Result: 在六个数据集上的广泛实验表明，Ceb在语义分割概率图上优于现有的像素聚类方法，并且与最先进的细胞实例分割方法相比具有高度竞争力的性能。

Conclusion: Ceb方法通过利用细胞边界特征有效解决了像素级目标可能丢失几何特性的问题，在细胞实例分割任务中表现出色。

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) methods for cell instance segmentation are based on
deep learning (DL) semantic segmentation approaches, focusing on distinguishing
foreground pixels from background pixels. In order to identify cell instances
from foreground pixels (e.g., pixel clustering), most methods decompose
instance information into pixel-wise objectives, such as distances to
foreground-background boundaries (distance maps), heat gradients with the
center point as heat source (heat diffusion maps), and distances from the
center point to foreground-background boundaries with fixed angles (star-shaped
polygons). However, pixel-wise objectives may lose significant geometric
properties of the cell instances, such as shape, curvature, and convexity,
which require a collection of pixels to represent. To address this challenge,
we present a novel pixel clustering method, called Ceb (for Cell boundaries),
to leverage cell boundary features and labels to divide foreground pixels into
cell instances. Starting with probability maps generated from semantic
segmentation, Ceb first extracts potential foreground-foreground boundaries
with a revised Watershed algorithm. For each boundary candidate, a boundary
feature representation (called boundary signature) is constructed by sampling
pixels from the current foreground-foreground boundary as well as the
neighboring background-foreground boundaries. Next, a boundary classifier is
used to predict its binary boundary label based on the corresponding boundary
signature. Finally, cell instances are obtained by dividing or merging
neighboring regions based on the predicted boundary labels. Extensive
experiments on six datasets demonstrate that Ceb outperforms existing pixel
clustering methods on semantic segmentation probability maps. Moreover, Ceb
achieves highly competitive performance compared to SOTA cell instance
segmentation methods.

*Zhi Chen,Xin Yu,Xiaohui Tao,Yan Li,Zi Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了CAPEL框架，通过聚类感知的提示集成学习改进视觉语言模型的零样本分类性能，避免传统特征平均导致的类别中心偏移问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统提示集成方法通过平均文本特征来融合多个上下文提示，但这种方法会使类别中心偏离真实分布，导致次优结果。

Method: CAPEL框架将图像分类到不同的类别簇中，每个簇由不同的提示表示；在分类logits空间进行集成而非特征空间；引入聚类保持正则化项；采用自适应提示加权技术。

Result: 该方法能更好地与视觉特征分布对齐，保持提示的区分能力，对缺陷或模糊提示具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: CAPEL框架通过聚类感知的提示集成学习，有效提升了视觉语言模型在零样本分类任务中的性能。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP achieve zero-shot transfer across
various tasks by pre-training on numerous image-text pairs. These models often
benefit from using an ensemble of context prompts to represent a class. Despite
being effective, conventional prompt ensembling that averages textual features
of context prompts often yields suboptimal results. This is because feature
averaging shifts the class centroids away from the true class distribution. To
address this issue, we propose the Cluster-Aware Prompt Ensemble Learning
(CAPEL) framework, which preserves the cluster nature of context prompts. CAPEL
classifies images into one of several class clusters, each represented by a
distinct prompt. Instead of ensembling prompts in the feature space, we perform
ensembling in the classification logits space, aligning better with the visual
feature distribution. To further optimize prompt fine-tuning while maintaining
cluster-specific discriminative power, we introduce a cluster-preserving
regularization term. This ensures that prompts remain distinct and specialized
for different clusters, preventing collapse into a uniform direction.
Additionally, we integrate an adaptive prompt weighting technique to
dynamically adjust the attention weights for flawed or ambiguous prompts,
ensuring robust performance across diverse datasets and tasks.

*Milad Khanchi,Maria Amer,Charalambos Poullis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种新的多目标跟踪方法，使用自监督编码器融合深度和掩码特征生成稳定的对象表示，替代计算密集的分割掩码IoU，在复杂场景中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MOT方法依赖IoU进行关联，但在对象相似或被遮挡时不可靠，且计算分割掩码IoU计算成本高。

Method: 融合深度和掩码特征，通过自监督训练的紧凑编码器生成对象表示，结合边界框IoU和重识别特征进行匹配。使用零样本深度估计器和提示式视觉分割模型获取空间线索。

Result: 在SportsMOT和DanceTrack等复杂基准测试中，该方法在大多数指标上优于TBD最新技术，在MOT17等简单基准测试中表现竞争性。

Conclusion: 该方法首次使用自监督编码器优化分割掩码而不计算掩码IoU，为复杂场景下的多目标跟踪提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-object tracking (MOT) methods often rely on Intersection-over-Union
(IoU) for association. However, this becomes unreliable when objects are
similar or occluded. Also, computing IoU for segmentation masks is
computationally expensive. In this work, we use segmentation masks to capture
object shapes, but we do not compute segmentation IoU. Instead, we fuse depth
and mask features and pass them through a compact encoder trained
self-supervised. This encoder produces stable object representations, which we
use as an additional similarity cue alongside bounding box IoU and
re-identification features for matching. We obtain depth maps from a zero-shot
depth estimator and object masks from a promptable visual segmentation model to
obtain fine-grained spatial cues. Our MOT method is the first to use the
self-supervised encoder to refine segmentation masks without computing masks
IoU. MOT can be divided into joint detection-ReID (JDR) and
tracking-by-detection (TBD) models. The latter are computationally more
efficient. Experiments of our TBD method on challenging benchmarks with
non-linear motion, occlusion, and crowded scenes, such as SportsMOT and
DanceTrack, show that our method outperforms the TBD state-of-the-art on most
metrics, while achieving competitive performance on simpler benchmarks with
linear motion, such as MOT17.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有HDR视频质量评估数据集主要关注专业生成内容，缺乏对用户生成内容中真实世界退化情况的研究，而UGC在YouTube、TikTok等平台上的激增带来了独特的质量评估挑战。

Method: 构建了包含856个UGC-HDR源视频的数据集，通过在不同分辨率和比特率下转码模拟真实场景，总计5,992个视频，并通过Amazon Mechanical Turk进行大规模主观研究收集了211,848个感知评分。

Conclusion: CHUG数据集将推动无参考HDR视频质量评估研究，通过提供大规模、多样化的真实世界UGC数据集来填补现有研究空白。

Abstract: High Dynamic Range (HDR) videos enhance visual experiences with superior
brightness, contrast, and color depth. The surge of User-Generated Content
(UGC) on platforms like YouTube and TikTok introduces unique challenges for HDR
video quality assessment (VQA) due to diverse capture conditions, editing
artifacts, and compression distortions. Existing HDR-VQA datasets primarily
focus on professionally generated content (PGC), leaving a gap in understanding
real-world UGC-HDR degradations. To address this, we introduce CHUG:
Crowdsourced User-Generated HDR Video Quality Dataset, the first large-scale
subjective study on UGC-HDR quality. CHUG comprises 856 UGC-HDR source videos,
transcoded across multiple resolutions and bitrates to simulate real-world
scenarios, totaling 5,992 videos. A large-scale study via Amazon Mechanical
Turk collected 211,848 perceptual ratings. CHUG provides a benchmark for
analyzing UGC-specific distortions in HDR videos. We anticipate CHUG will
advance No-Reference (NR) HDR-VQA research by offering a large-scale, diverse,
and real-world UGC dataset. The dataset is publicly available at:

*Minkwan Kim,Changwoon Choi,Young Min Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出场景自适应策略，通过几何先验指导表示容量的高效分配，用于从非完整观测生成室内环境的沉浸式体验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 室内场景具有不规则布局和变化复杂度，包含杂乱、遮挡和平坦墙面。需要最大化有限资源的利用率。

Method: 在估计的几何支架上记录观测统计，指导基函数的最优放置；提出场景自适应虚拟视点来补偿输入轨迹中视图配置的几何缺陷。

Result: 在多个大规模室内场景中，渲染质量和内存需求相比采用规则放置的基线方法有显著提升。

Conclusion: 场景自适应策略能有效提高神经辐射场表示在复杂室内环境中的效率和效果。

Abstract: We propose scene-adaptive strategies to efficiently allocate representation
capacity for generating immersive experiences of indoor environments from
incomplete observations. Indoor scenes with multiple rooms often exhibit
irregular layouts with varying complexity, containing clutter, occlusion, and
flat walls. We maximize the utilization of limited resources with guidance from
geometric priors, which are often readily available after pre-processing
stages. We record observation statistics on the estimated geometric scaffold
and guide the optimal placement of bases, which greatly improves upon the
uniform basis arrangements adopted by previous scalable Neural Radiance Field
(NeRF) representations. We also suggest scene-adaptive virtual viewpoints to
compensate for geometric deficiencies inherent in view configurations in the
input trajectory and impose the necessary regularization. We present a
comprehensive analysis and discussion regarding rendering quality and memory
requirements in several large-scale indoor scenes, demonstrating significant
enhancements compared to baselines that employ regular placements.

TL;DR: LTGS是一种高效场景表示方法，能从稀疏视角更新中建模长期场景变化，通过模板高斯和少样本观察适应时间变化环境。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决日常环境从随意拍摄中获取的挑战，包括频繁场景变化和需要密集时空观察的问题。

Method: 将对象构建为模板高斯作为结构先验，通过少样本观察调制先验以适应时间变化环境，使用简单变换实现多时间步泛化。

Result: 相比其他基线方法获得更优的重建质量，同时实现快速轻量级更新。

Conclusion: LTGS框架能有效处理长期场景变化，显著提升3D环境时间演化的可扩展性。

Abstract: Recent advances in novel-view synthesis can create the photo-realistic
visualization of real-world environments from conventional camera captures.
However, acquiring everyday environments from casual captures faces challenges
due to frequent scene changes, which require dense observations both spatially
and temporally. We propose long-term Gaussian scene chronology from sparse-view
updates, coined LTGS, an efficient scene representation that can embrace
everyday changes from highly under-constrained casual captures. Given an
incomplete and unstructured Gaussian splatting representation obtained from an
initial set of input images, we robustly model the long-term chronology of the
scene despite abrupt movements and subtle environmental variations. We
construct objects as template Gaussians, which serve as structural, reusable
priors for shared object tracks. Then, the object templates undergo a further
refinement pipeline that modulates the priors to adapt to temporally varying
environments based on few-shot observations. Once trained, our framework is
generalizable across multiple time steps through simple transformations,
significantly enhancing the scalability for a temporal evolution of 3D
environments. As existing datasets do not explicitly represent the long-term
real-world changes with a sparse capture setup, we collect real-world datasets
to evaluate the practicality of our pipeline. Experiments demonstrate that our
framework achieves superior reconstruction quality compared to other baselines
while enabling fast and light-weight updates.

*Lenny Aharon,Keemin Lee,Karan Sikka,Selmaan Chettih,Cole Hurwitz,Liam Paninski,Matthew R Whiteway*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一个多视角姿态估计框架，结合新颖的训练和后期处理技术，通过模型蒸馏提高效率，在有限标注数据下实现准确跟踪和更好的不确定性估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多视角动物姿态估计方法在有限标注数据下准确性不足，且不确定性估计较差，这限制了科学研究中动物行为量化的可靠性。

Method: 使用多视角变换器(MVT)同时处理所有视角信息，采用补丁掩码方案学习跨视角对应关系；对于标定设置，通过3D增强和三角化损失整合几何一致性；扩展非线性集成卡尔曼平滑器(EKS)并改进不确定性量化；设计蒸馏过程利用改进的EKS预测生成高质量伪标签。

Result: 框架组件在三种不同动物物种(苍蝇、小鼠、山雀)上一致优于现有方法，每个组件都提供互补优势。

Conclusion: 该框架提供了一个实用、不确定性感知的系统，能够在真实世界数据约束下实现可靠的姿态估计，支持下游行为分析。

Abstract: Multi-view pose estimation is essential for quantifying animal behavior in
scientific research, yet current methods struggle to achieve accurate tracking
with limited labeled data and suffer from poor uncertainty estimates. We
address these challenges with a comprehensive framework combining novel
training and post-processing techniques, and a model distillation procedure
that leverages the strengths of these techniques to produce a more efficient
and effective pose estimator. Our multi-view transformer (MVT) utilizes
pretrained backbones and enables simultaneous processing of information across
all views, while a novel patch masking scheme learns robust cross-view
correspondences without camera calibration. For calibrated setups, we
incorporate geometric consistency through 3D augmentation and a triangulation
loss. We extend the existing Ensemble Kalman Smoother (EKS) post-processor to
the nonlinear case and enhance uncertainty quantification via a variance
inflation technique. Finally, to leverage the scaling properties of the MVT, we
design a distillation procedure that exploits improved EKS predictions and
uncertainty estimates to generate high-quality pseudo-labels, thereby reducing
dependence on manual labels. Our framework components consistently outperform
existing methods across three diverse animal species (flies, mice, chickadees),
with each component contributing complementary benefits. The result is a
practical, uncertainty-aware system for reliable pose estimation that enables
downstream behavioral analyses under real-world data constraints.

Abstract: The relevance of this research lies in the growing demand for unmanned aerial
vehicles (UAVs) capable of operating reliably in complex environments where
conventional navigation becomes unreliable due to interference, poor
visibility, or camouflage. Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) provides unique
opportunities for UAV-based computer vision by enabling fine-grained material
recognition and object differentiation, which are critical for navigation,
surveillance, agriculture, and environmental monitoring. The aim of this work
is to develop a deep learning architecture integrating HSI into UAV perception
for navigation, object detection, and terrain classification. Objectives
include: reviewing existing HSI methods, designing a hybrid 2D/3D convolutional
architecture with spectral-spatial cross-attention, training, and benchmarking.
The methodology is based on the modification of the Mobile 3D Vision
Transformer (MDvT) by introducing the proposed SpectralCA block. This block
employs bi-directional cross-attention to fuse spectral and spatial features,
enhancing accuracy while reducing parameters and inference time. Experimental
evaluation was conducted on the WHU-Hi-HongHu dataset, with results assessed
using Overall Accuracy, Average Accuracy, and the Kappa coefficient. The
findings confirm that the proposed architecture improves UAV perception
efficiency, enabling real-time operation for navigation, object recognition,
and environmental monitoring tasks.

### [22] [HeadsUp! High-Fidelity Portrait Image Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09924)
*Renjie Li,Zihao Zhu,Xiaoyu Wang,Zhengzhong Tu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出HeadsUp模型，这是一个单步扩散模型，专门用于肖像图像超分辨率，能够端到端地无缝恢复和放大肖像图像，避免了传统混合方法产生的边界伪影问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像超分辨率技术要么专注于通用真实世界图像，要么专注于严格对齐的人脸图像。处理肖像照片时需要混合使用不同模型，这不可避免地会在面部区域周围引入混合或边界伪影，而人类感知对面部保真度特别敏感。

Method: 基于单步扩散模型构建，开发了面部监督机制来引导模型关注面部区域，并集成了基于参考的机制来帮助身份恢复，减少低质量人脸恢复中的模糊性。还构建了高质量的4K肖像图像超分辨率数据集PortraitSR-4K。

Result: 广泛实验表明，HeadsUp在肖像图像超分辨率任务上实现了最先进的性能，同时在通用图像和对齐人脸数据集上保持相当或更高的性能。

Conclusion: HeadsUp模型成功解决了肖像图像超分辨率问题，通过端到端的方式无缝恢复和放大肖像图像，避免了传统混合方法产生的边界伪影，并在多个数据集上表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Portrait pictures, which typically feature both human subjects and natural
backgrounds, are one of the most prevalent forms of photography on social
media. Existing image super-resolution (ISR) techniques generally focus either
on generic real-world images or strictly aligned facial images (i.e., face
super-resolution). In practice, separate models are blended to handle portrait
photos: the face specialist model handles the face region, and the general
model processes the rest. However, these blending approaches inevitably
introduce blending or boundary artifacts around the facial regions due to
different model training recipes, while human perception is particularly
sensitive to facial fidelity. To overcome these limitations, we study the
portrait image supersolution (PortraitISR) problem, and propose HeadsUp, a
single-step diffusion model that is capable of seamlessly restoring and
upscaling portrait images in an end-to-end manner. Specifically, we build our
model on top of a single-step diffusion model and develop a face supervision
mechanism to guide the model in focusing on the facial region. We then
integrate a reference-based mechanism to help with identity restoration,
reducing face ambiguity in low-quality face restoration. Additionally, we have
built a high-quality 4K portrait image ISR dataset dubbed PortraitSR-4K, to
support model training and benchmarking for portrait images. Extensive
experiments show that HeadsUp achieves state-of-the-art performance on the
PortraitISR task while maintaining comparable or higher performance on both
general image and aligned face datasets.

Conclusion: 提出的数据扩展和质量增强方法能够有效克服现有水下图像数据集的局限性，促进海洋生态系统研究的深入发展。

Abstract: Underwater images play a crucial role in ocean research and marine
environmental monitoring since they provide quality information about the
ecosystem. However, the complex and remote nature of the environment results in
poor image quality with issues such as low visibility, blurry textures, color
distortion, and noise. In recent years, research in image enhancement has
proven to be effective but also presents its own limitations, like poor
generalization and heavy reliance on clean datasets. One of the challenges
herein is the lack of diversity and the low quality of images included in these
datasets. Also, most existing datasets consist only of monocular images, a fact
that limits the representation of different lighting conditions and angles. In
this paper, we propose a new plan of action to overcome these limitations. On
one hand, we call for expanding the datasets using a denoising diffusion model
to include a variety of image types such as stereo, wide-angled, macro, and
close-up images. On the other hand, we recommend enhancing the images using
Controlnet to evaluate and increase the quality of the corresponding datasets,
and hence improve the study of the marine ecosystem.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于隐式神经表示(INR)的新方法，用于建模脑部衰老轨迹，能够处理不规则采样的纵向MRI数据，并在脑衰老轨迹分类任务中优于传统深度学习方法。

Motivation: 纵向MRI数据具有离散性和不同的时空采样模式，传统深度学习方法难以表示潜在的连续生物过程，需要能够处理这种数据特性的新方法。

Method: 使用隐式神经表示(INR)将纵向T1加权MRI数据建模为连续函数，设计了能够部分解耦空间和时间轨迹参数的新型INR架构，并直接在INR参数空间进行分类。

Result: 在模拟数据实验中，对于不规则采样情况，INR方法在脑衰老轨迹分类任务中达到81.3%的准确率，显著优于标准深度学习基线模型的73.7%。

Conclusion: INR方法能够有效处理不规则采样的纵向神经影像数据，为脑衰老轨迹建模提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: The human brain undergoes dynamic, potentially pathology-driven, structural
changes throughout a lifespan. Longitudinal Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)
and other neuroimaging data are valuable for characterizing trajectories of
change associated with typical and atypical aging. However, the analysis of
such data is highly challenging given their discrete nature with different
spatial and temporal image sampling patterns within individuals and across
populations. This leads to computational problems for most traditional deep
learning methods that cannot represent the underlying continuous biological
process. To address these limitations, we present a new, fully data-driven
method for representing aging trajectories across the entire brain by modelling
subject-specific longitudinal T1-weighted MRI data as continuous functions
using Implicit Neural Representations (INRs). Therefore, we introduce a novel
INR architecture capable of partially disentangling spatial and temporal
trajectory parameters and design an efficient framework that directly operates
on the INRs' parameter space to classify brain aging trajectories. To evaluate
our method in a controlled data environment, we develop a biologically grounded
trajectory simulation and generate T1-weighted 3D MRI data for 450 healthy and
dementia-like subjects at regularly and irregularly sampled timepoints. In the
more realistic irregular sampling experiment, our INR-based method achieves
81.3% accuracy for the brain aging trajectory classification task,
outperforming a standard deep learning baseline model (73.7%).

Conclusion: 该框架为研究人员和从业者提供了一种构建准确、稳健、数据高效且适应真实世界领域的分割系统的实用方法。

Abstract: Segmentation models achieve high accuracy on benchmarks but often fail in
real-world domains by relying on spurious correlations instead of true object
boundaries. We propose a human-in-the-loop interactive framework that enables
interventional learning through targeted human corrections of segmentation
outputs. Our approach treats human corrections as interventional signals that
show when reliance on superficial features (e.g., color or texture) is
inappropriate. The system learns from these interventions by propagating
correction-informed edits across visually similar images, effectively steering
the model toward robust, semantically meaningful features rather than
dataset-specific artifacts. Unlike traditional annotation approaches that
simply provide more training data, our method explicitly identifies when and
why the model fails and then systematically corrects these failure modes across
the entire dataset. Through iterative human feedback, the system develops
increasingly robust representations that generalize better to novel domains and
resist artifactual correlations. We demonstrate that our framework improves
segmentation accuracy by up to 9 mIoU points (12-15\% relative improvement) on
challenging cubemap data and yields 3-4$\times$ reductions in annotation effort
compared to standard retraining, while maintaining competitive performance on
benchmark datasets. This work provides a practical framework for researchers
and practitioners seeking to build segmentation systems that are accurate,
robust to dataset biases, data-efficient, and adaptable to real-world domains
such as urban climate monitoring and autonomous driving.

Abstract: As a specialty agricultural product with a large market scale, Shatian pomelo
necessitates the adoption of automated detection to ensure accurate quantity
and meet commercial demands for lean production. Existing research often
involves specialized networks tailored for specific theoretical or dataset
scenarios, but these methods tend to degrade performance in real-world. Through
analysis of factors in this issue, this study identifies four key challenges
that affect the accuracy of Shatian pomelo detection: imaging devices, lighting
conditions, object scale variation, and occlusion. To mitigate these
challenges, a multi-strategy framework is proposed in this paper. Firstly, to
effectively solve tone variation introduced by diverse imaging devices and
complex orchard environments, we utilize a multi-scenario dataset,
STP-AgriData, which is constructed by integrating real orchard images with
internet-sourced data. Secondly, to simulate the inconsistent illumination
conditions, specific data augmentations such as adjusting contrast and changing
brightness, are applied to the above dataset. Thirdly, to address the issues of
object scale variation and occlusion in fruit detection, an REAS-Det network is
designed in this paper. For scale variation, RFAConv and C3RFEM modules are
designed to expand and enhance the receptive fields. For occlusion variation, a
multi-scale, multi-head feature selection structure (MultiSEAM) and soft-NMS
are introduced to enhance the handling of occlusion issues to improve detection
accuracy. The results of these experiments achieved a precision(P) of 87.6%, a
recall (R) of 74.9%, a mAP@.50 of 82.8%, and a mAP@.50:.95 of 53.3%. Our
proposed network demonstrates superior performance compared to other
state-of-the-art detection methods.

Abstract: Image segmentation, the process of dividing images into meaningful regions,
is critical in medical applications for accurate diagnosis, treatment planning,
and disease monitoring. Although manual segmentation by healthcare
professionals produces precise outcomes, it is time-consuming, costly, and
prone to variability due to differences in human expertise. Artificial
intelligence (AI)-based methods have been developed to address these
limitations by automating segmentation tasks; however, they often require
large, annotated datasets that are rarely available in practice and frequently
struggle to generalize across diverse imaging conditions due to inter-patient
variability and rare pathological cases. In this paper, we propose Joint
Retrieval Augmented Segmentation (J-RAS), a joint training method for guided
image segmentation that integrates a segmentation model with a retrieval model.
Both models are jointly optimized, enabling the segmentation model to leverage
retrieved image-mask pairs to enrich its anatomical understanding, while the
retrieval model learns segmentation-relevant features beyond simple visual
similarity. This joint optimization ensures that retrieval actively contributes
meaningful contextual cues to guide boundary delineation, thereby enhancing the
overall segmentation performance. We validate J-RAS across multiple
segmentation backbones, including U-Net, TransUNet, SAM, and SegFormer, on two
benchmark datasets: ACDC and M&Ms, demonstrating consistent improvements. For
example, on the ACDC dataset, SegFormer without J-RAS achieves a mean Dice
score of 0.8708$\pm$0.042 and a mean Hausdorff Distance (HD) of
1.8130$\pm$2.49, whereas with J-RAS, the performance improves substantially to
a mean Dice score of 0.9115$\pm$0.031 and a mean HD of 1.1489$\pm$0.30. These
results highlight the method's effectiveness and its generalizability across
architectures and datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于AI的端到端交通监控框架，利用现有交通摄像头进行高分辨率纵向分析，通过微调YOLOv11模型和图形化视角归一化方法处理动态摄像头视角问题，集成领域专用大语言模型自动生成交通模式总结，在纽约拥堵收费政策实施期间验证了系统有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统交通传感器部署成本高昂，而现有视频分析技术难以处理大规模摄像头网络的动态视角和海量数据，需要开发成本效益高、可扩展的交通监控解决方案。

Method: 使用微调的YOLOv11模型进行实时多模态交通密度和分类指标提取；提出基于图形的视角归一化方法处理非静态PTZ摄像头的不一致性；集成领域专用大语言模型处理24/7视频流数据并生成自动化总结。

Result: 在纽约拥堵收费政策早期实施期间验证，显示拥堵缓解区内工作日乘用车密度下降9%，卡车流量早期减少但出现反弹迹象，行人和自行车活动在走廊和区域尺度上持续增加；基于示例的提示提高了LLM的数字准确性并减少幻觉。

Conclusion: 该框架展示了作为实用、基础设施就绪的大规模交通监控解决方案的潜力，能够以最小人工干预进行政策相关的交通监测。

Abstract: Accurate, scalable traffic monitoring is critical for real-time and long-term
transportation management, particularly during disruptions such as natural
disasters, large construction projects, or major policy changes like New York
City's first-in-the-nation congestion pricing program. However, widespread
sensor deployment remains limited due to high installation, maintenance, and
data management costs. While traffic cameras offer a cost-effective
alternative, existing video analytics struggle with dynamic camera viewpoints
and massive data volumes from large camera networks. This study presents an
end-to-end AI-based framework leveraging existing traffic camera infrastructure
for high-resolution, longitudinal analysis at scale. A fine-tuned YOLOv11
model, trained on localized urban scenes, extracts multimodal traffic density
and classification metrics in real time. To address inconsistencies from
non-stationary pan-tilt-zoom cameras, we introduce a novel graph-based
viewpoint normalization method. A domain-specific large language model was also
integrated to process massive data from a 24/7 video stream to generate
frequent, automated summaries of evolving traffic patterns, a task far
exceeding manual capabilities. We validated the system using over 9 million
images from roughly 1,000 traffic cameras during the early rollout of NYC
congestion pricing in 2025. Results show a 9% decline in weekday passenger
vehicle density within the Congestion Relief Zone, early truck volume
reductions with signs of rebound, and consistent increases in pedestrian and
cyclist activity at corridor and zonal scales. Experiments showed that
example-based prompts improved LLM's numerical accuracy and reduced
hallucinations. These findings demonstrate the framework's potential as a
practical, infrastructure-ready solution for large-scale, policy-relevant
traffic monitoring with minimal human intervention.

### [29] [FlareX: A Physics-Informed Dataset for Lens Flare Removal via 2D Synthesis and 3D Rendering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09995)
*Lishen Qu,Zhihao Liu,Jinshan Pan,Shihao Zhou,Jinglei Shi,Duosheng Chen,Jufeng Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于物理原理的镜头光晕数据生成方法FlareX，包含参数化模板创建、光照感知的2D合成和物理引擎3D渲染三个阶段，构建了包含9500个2D模板和3000个3D渲染图像对的混合数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有光晕数据集通常通过将人工光晕模板叠加到背景图像上来合成，但模板多样性不足且忽略物理原理，导致训练模型难以泛化到真实场景。

Method: 三阶段方法：参数化模板创建、光照感知的2D合成、物理引擎3D渲染，构建混合数据集FlareX，并设计掩码方法从损坏图像中获取真实无光晕图像。

Result: 构建了包含9500个2D模板（来自95种光晕模式）和3000个光晕图像对（来自60个3D场景）的数据集，实验证明方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的物理感知光晕数据生成方法能有效提升模型在真实场景中的泛化能力，FlareX数据集为光晕去除研究提供了高质量数据支持。

Abstract: Lens flare occurs when shooting towards strong light sources, significantly
degrading the visual quality of images. Due to the difficulty in capturing
flare-corrupted and flare-free image pairs in the real world, existing datasets
are typically synthesized in 2D by overlaying artificial flare templates onto
background images. However, the lack of flare diversity in templates and the
neglect of physical principles in the synthesis process hinder models trained
on these datasets from generalizing well to real-world scenarios. To address
these challenges, we propose a new physics-informed method for flare data
generation, which consists of three stages: parameterized template creation,
the laws of illumination-aware 2D synthesis, and physical engine-based 3D
rendering, which finally gives us a mixed flare dataset that incorporates both
2D and 3D perspectives, namely FlareX. This dataset offers 9,500 2D templates
derived from 95 flare patterns and 3,000 flare image pairs rendered from 60 3D
scenes. Furthermore, we design a masking approach to obtain real-world
flare-free images from their corrupted counterparts to measure the performance
of the model on real-world images. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method and dataset.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了BurstDeflicker基准数据集，通过三种互补的数据采集策略解决闪烁伪影去除研究中缺乏大规模真实数据集的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 滚动快门相机与交流电照明之间的相互作用导致短曝光图像中出现闪烁伪影，表现为不均匀的亮度分布和暗带。这些伪影不仅影响图像质量，还影响目标检测和跟踪等高级任务。缺乏大规模真实数据集是闪烁去除研究的主要障碍。

Method: 1. 开发基于Retinex的合成流水线，可控制关键闪烁属性；2. 从不同场景采集4000张真实闪烁图像；3. 提出绿幕方法在图像对中引入运动同时保留真实闪烁退化。

Result: 构建了一个可扩展的基准数据集，综合实验证明了数据集的有效性。

Conclusion: BurstDeflicker数据集具有推动闪烁去除研究发展的潜力。

Abstract: Flicker artifacts in short-exposure images are caused by the interplay
between the row-wise exposure mechanism of rolling shutter cameras and the
temporal intensity variations of alternating current (AC)-powered lighting.
These artifacts typically appear as uneven brightness distribution across the
image, forming noticeable dark bands. Beyond compromising image quality, this
structured noise also affects high-level tasks, such as object detection and
tracking, where reliable lighting is crucial. Despite the prevalence of
flicker, the lack of a large-scale, realistic dataset has been a significant
barrier to advancing research in flicker removal. To address this issue, we
present BurstDeflicker, a scalable benchmark constructed using three
complementary data acquisition strategies. First, we develop a Retinex-based
synthesis pipeline that redefines the goal of flicker removal and enables
controllable manipulation of key flicker-related attributes (e.g., intensity,
area, and frequency), thereby facilitating the generation of diverse flicker
patterns. Second, we capture 4,000 real-world flicker images from different
scenes, which help the model better understand the spatial and temporal
characteristics of real flicker artifacts and generalize more effectively to
wild scenarios. Finally, due to the non-repeatable nature of dynamic scenes, we
propose a green-screen method to incorporate motion into image pairs while
preserving real flicker degradation. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our dataset and its potential to advance research in flicker
removal.

TL;DR: 提出了MIMO模型，解决现有医学视觉语言模型的两个问题：输入缺乏对图像视觉线索的直接理解，输出缺乏与图像关键区域的连接。MIMO具有视觉参考多模态输入和像素定位多模态输出能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学视觉语言模型存在两个问题：输入仅依赖文本指令而缺乏对图像视觉线索的直接理解；输出仅给出文本答案而缺乏与图像关键区域的连接。

Method: 提出统一的医学视觉语言模型MIMO，具有视觉参考多模态输入和像素定位多模态输出能力。构建了包含89.5万样本的MIMOSeg数据集，从四个不同角度覆盖基础指令跟随和复杂问答任务。

Result: 在多个下游医学多模态任务上的实验结果表明，MIMO能够独特地结合视觉参考和像素定位能力，这是先前模型所不具备的。

Conclusion: MIMO模型成功解决了医学视觉语言模型在输入和输出方面的局限性，通过视觉参考和像素定位能力实现了对医学图像的更深入理解。

Abstract: Currently, medical vision language models are widely used in medical vision
question answering tasks. However, existing models are confronted with two
issues: for input, the model only relies on text instructions and lacks direct
understanding of visual clues in the image; for output, the model only gives
text answers and lacks connection with key areas in the image. To address these
issues, we propose a unified medical vision language model MIMO, with visual
referring Multimodal Input and pixel grounding Multimodal Output. MIMO can not
only combine visual clues and textual instructions to understand complex
medical images and semantics, but can also ground medical terminologies in
textual output within the image. To overcome the scarcity of relevant data in
the medical field, we propose MIMOSeg, a comprehensive medical multimodal
dataset including 895K samples. MIMOSeg is constructed from four different
perspectives, covering basic instruction following and complex question
answering with multimodal input and multimodal output. We conduct experiments
on several downstream medical multimodal tasks. Extensive experimental results
verify that MIMO can uniquely combine visual referring and pixel grounding
capabilities, which are not available in previous models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Query-Adapter（Q-Adapter）轻量级视觉适配器模块，用于多模态大语言模型的参数高效微调，在视频字幕任务中仅需1.4%参数即可达到与全参数微调相竞争的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统全参数微调方法在大模型时代计算成本过高，而现有参数高效微调方法主要关注语言组件，对多模态任务中的视觉信息理解不足。

Method: Q-Adapter在视觉编码器中引入可学习查询令牌和门控层，无需外部文本监督即可有效提取稀疏的、与字幕相关的特征。

Result: 在MSR-VTT和MSVD数据集上，Q-Adapter在参数高效微调方法中达到最先进性能，在BLEU@4、METEOR、ROUGE-L和CIDEr指标上表现优异。

Conclusion: Q-Adapter在字幕质量和参数效率之间取得了良好平衡，展示了其在视频语言建模中的可扩展性潜力。

Abstract: Recent advances in video captioning are driven by large-scale pretrained
models, which follow the standard "pre-training followed by fine-tuning"
paradigm, where the full model is fine-tuned for downstream tasks. Although
effective, this approach becomes computationally prohibitive as the model size
increases. The Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) approach offers a
promising alternative, but primarily focuses on the language components of
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Despite recent progress, PEFT remains
underexplored in multimodal tasks and lacks sufficient understanding of visual
information during fine-tuning the model. To bridge this gap, we propose
Query-Adapter (Q-Adapter), a lightweight visual adapter module designed to
enhance MLLMs by enabling efficient fine-tuning for the video captioning task.
Q-Adapter introduces learnable query tokens and a gating layer into Vision
Encoder, enabling effective extraction of sparse, caption-relevant features
without relying on external textual supervision. We evaluate Q-Adapter on two
well-known video captioning datasets, MSR-VTT and MSVD, where it achieves
state-of-the-art performance among the methods that take the PEFT approach
across BLEU@4, METEOR, ROUGE-L, and CIDEr metrics. Q-Adapter also achieves
competitive performance compared to methods that take the full fine-tuning
approach while requiring only 1.4% of the parameters. We further analyze the
impact of key hyperparameters and design choices on fine-tuning effectiveness,
providing insights into optimization strategies for adapter-based learning.
These results highlight the strong potential of Q-Adapter in balancing caption
quality and parameter efficiency, demonstrating its scalability for
video-language modeling.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: P-4DGS是一种用于紧凑4D场景建模的动态3D高斯泼溅表示方法，通过时空预测和压缩技术显著减少内存消耗，实现高达90倍的压缩率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的动态3DGS算法忽略了动态场景中固有的时间和空间冗余，导致内存消耗过高，需要更紧凑的4D场景表示方法。

Method: 设计了基于3D锚点的时空预测模块来利用3D高斯基元间的时空相关性，并结合自适应量化和基于上下文的熵编码来压缩3D锚点。

Result: 在合成和真实世界数据集上实现了最先进的重建质量和最快的渲染速度，平均存储占用仅约1MB，压缩率分别达到40倍和90倍。

Conclusion: P-4DGS通过有效的时空压缩技术，在保持高质量重建的同时显著降低了动态3D场景的存储需求，为4D场景建模提供了高效的解决方案。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has garnered significant attention due to its
superior scene representation fidelity and real-time rendering performance,
especially for dynamic 3D scene reconstruction (\textit{i.e.}, 4D
reconstruction). However, despite achieving promising results, most existing
algorithms overlook the substantial temporal and spatial redundancies inherent
in dynamic scenes, leading to prohibitive memory consumption. To address this,
we propose P-4DGS, a novel dynamic 3DGS representation for compact 4D scene
modeling. Inspired by intra- and inter-frame prediction techniques commonly
used in video compression, we first design a 3D anchor point-based
spatial-temporal prediction module to fully exploit the spatial-temporal
correlations across different 3D Gaussian primitives. Subsequently, we employ
an adaptive quantization strategy combined with context-based entropy coding to
further reduce the size of the 3D anchor points, thereby achieving enhanced
compression efficiency. To evaluate the rate-distortion performance of our
proposed P-4DGS in comparison with other dynamic 3DGS representations, we
conduct extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets.
Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art
reconstruction quality and the fastest rendering speed, with a remarkably low
storage footprint (around \textbf{1MB} on average), achieving up to
\textbf{40$\times$} and \textbf{90$\times$} compression on synthetic and
real-world scenes, respectively.

TL;DR: CCFormer是一个新颖的音频-视觉分割框架，通过互补和对比Transformer处理局部和全局信息，在多个数据集上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CNN方法受限于局部感受野，而基于Transformer的方法在提取多模态系数和时序动态方面存在不足，需要更全面处理空间-时间上下文的方法。

Method: 提出CCFormer框架，包含早期集成模块(EIM)融合多尺度视觉特征和音频数据，多查询Transformer模块(MTM)动态赋予音频查询学习能力并同时建模帧级和视频级关系，以及双模态对比学习(BCL)促进统一特征空间中的模态对齐。

Result: 在S4、MS3和AVSS数据集上建立了新的最先进基准。

Conclusion: CCFormer通过有效结合局部-全局信息处理和空间-时间上下文捕捉，显著提升了音频-视觉分割性能。

Abstract: Audio-Visual Segmentation (AVS) aims to generate pixel-wise segmentation maps
that correlate with the auditory signals of objects. This field has seen
significant progress with numerous CNN and Transformer-based methods enhancing
the segmentation accuracy and robustness. Traditional CNN approaches manage
audio-visual interactions through basic operations like padding and
multiplications but are restricted by CNNs' limited local receptive field. More
recently, Transformer-based methods treat auditory cues as queries, utilizing
attention mechanisms to enhance audio-visual cooperation within frames.
Nevertheless, they typically struggle to extract multimodal coefficients and
temporal dynamics adequately. To overcome these limitations, we present the
Complementary and Contrastive Transformer (CCFormer), a novel framework adept
at processing both local and global information and capturing spatial-temporal
context comprehensively. Our CCFormer initiates with the Early Integration
Module (EIM) that employs a parallel bilateral architecture, merging
multi-scale visual features with audio data to boost cross-modal
complementarity. To extract the intra-frame spatial features and facilitate the
perception of temporal coherence, we introduce the Multi-query Transformer
Module (MTM), which dynamically endows audio queries with learning capabilities
and models the frame and video-level relations simultaneously. Furthermore, we
propose the Bi-modal Contrastive Learning (BCL) to promote the alignment across
both modalities in the unified feature space. Through the effective combination
of those designs, our method sets new state-of-the-art benchmarks across the
S4, MS3 and AVSS datasets. Our source code and model weights will be made
publicly available at https://github.com/SitongGong/CCFormer

TL;DR: ViTAR是一个模仿人类专家迭代推理过程的医学视觉语言模型框架，通过"思考-行动-再思考-回答"的认知链进行多步视觉推理，在医学诊断任务中超越现有最先进模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的医学视觉语言模型通常依赖单次推理，忽略了局部视觉线索。而临床实践中，人类专家会迭代扫描、聚焦和精炼感兴趣区域后才做出最终诊断。ViTAR旨在缩小这种机器与人类感知差距。

Method: 提出ViTAR框架，将医学图像视为交互对象，通过"思考-行动-再思考-回答"的认知链进行多步视觉推理。构建了包含1K交互示例和16K视觉问答的高质量数据集，采用两阶段训练策略：监督微调引导认知轨迹，强化学习优化决策。

Result: 广泛评估表明ViTAR优于现有最先进模型。视觉注意力分析显示，从"思考"到"再思考"阶段，ViTAR逐渐将视觉基础锚定到临床关键区域，并在推理过程中保持对视觉标记的高度注意力分配。

Conclusion: 将专家风格的迭代思维链嵌入视觉语言模型中，可以同时提升医学AI的性能和可信度。

Abstract: Medical vision-language models (VLMs) excel at image-text understanding but
typically rely on a single-pass reasoning that neglects localized visual cues.
In clinical practice, however, human experts iteratively scan, focus, and
refine the regions of interest before reaching a final diagnosis. To narrow
this machine-human perception gap, we introduce ViTAR, a novel VLM framework
that emulates the iterative reasoning process of human experts through a
cognitive chain of "think-act-rethink-answer". ViTAR treats medical images as
interactive objects, enabling models to engage multi-step visual reasoning. To
support this approach, we curate a high-quality instruction dataset comprising
1K interactive examples that encode expert-like diagnostic behaviors. In
addition, a 16K visual question answering training data has been curated
towards fine-grained visual diagnosis. We introduce a two-stage training
strategy that begins with supervised fine-tuning to guide cognitive
trajectories, followed by the reinforcement learning to optimize
decision-making. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that ViTAR outperforms
strong state-of-the-art models. Visual attention analysis reveals that from the
"think" to "rethink" rounds, ViTAR increasingly anchors visual grounding to
clinically critical regions and maintains high attention allocation to visual
tokens during reasoning, providing mechanistic insight into its improved
performance. These findings demonstrate that embedding expert-style iterative
thinking chains into VLMs enhances both performance and trustworthiness of
medical AI.

Abstract: Deep learning based face-swap videos, widely known as deepfakes, have drawn
wide attention due to their threat to information credibility. Recent works
mainly focus on the problem of deepfake detection that aims to reliably tell
deepfakes apart from real ones, in an objective way. On the other hand, the
subjective perception of deepfakes, especially its computational modeling and
imitation, is also a significant problem but lacks adequate study. In this
paper, we focus on the visual realism assessment of deepfakes, which is defined
as the automatic assessment of deepfake visual realism that approximates human
perception of deepfakes. It is important for evaluating the quality and
deceptiveness of deepfakes which can be used for predicting the influence of
deepfakes on Internet, and it also has potentials in improving the deepfake
generation process by serving as a critic. This paper prompts this new
direction by presenting a comprehensive benchmark called DREAM, which stands
for Deepfake REalism AssessMent. It is comprised of a deepfake video dataset of
diverse quality, a large scale annotation that includes 140,000 realism scores
and textual descriptions obtained from 3,500 human annotators, and a
comprehensive evaluation and analysis of 16 representative realism assessment
methods, including recent large vision language model based methods and a newly
proposed description-aligned CLIP method. The benchmark and insights included
in this study can lay the foundation for future research in this direction and
other related areas.

Conclusion: CLSL方法通过协同学习框架有效解决了多标签图像识别中的不完整标签问题，实现了语义感知特征学习和标签恢复的相互促进

Abstract: Multi-label image recognition with incomplete labels is a critical learning
task and has emerged as a focal topic in computer vision. However, this task is
confronted with two core challenges: semantic-aware feature learning and
missing label recovery. In this paper, we propose a novel Collaborative
Learning of Semantic-aware feature learning and Label recovery (CLSL) method
for multi-label image recognition with incomplete labels, which unifies the two
aforementioned challenges into a unified learning framework. More specifically,
we design a semantic-related feature learning module to learn robust
semantic-related features by discovering semantic information and label
correlations. Then, a semantic-guided feature enhancement module is proposed to
generate high-quality discriminative semantic-aware features by effectively
aligning visual and semantic feature spaces. Finally, we introduce a
collaborative learning framework that integrates semantic-aware feature
learning and label recovery, which can not only dynamically enhance the
discriminability of semantic-aware features but also adaptively infer and
recover missing labels, forming a mutually reinforced loop between the two
processes. Extensive experiments on three widely used public datasets (MS-COCO,
VOC2007, and NUS-WIDE) demonstrate that CLSL outperforms the state-of-the-art
multi-label image recognition methods with incomplete labels.

Motivation: 利用自监督预训练方法（如MAE）不需要手动标注数据的优势，将经典的神经图工作与现代掩码自编码器方法在统一理论框架下结合，以处理多模态多任务学习场景。

Method: 提出PHG-MAE模型，随机掩码整个模态而非仅补丁，在每次前向传播中采样超边分布；将预训练和微调结合到单一训练循环；支持推理时集成和知识蒸馏。

Result: 模型能够创建推理时集成，通过聚合提升最终预测性能和一致性；即使参数少于100万的模型，知识蒸馏也能保持良好性能；开发了数据管道软件并发布了Dronescapes数据集的自动化扩展。

Conclusion: PHG-MAE为多模态多任务学习提供了有效的统一框架，特别适用于无人机户外场景，也可推广到自动驾驶和室内机器人等领域；所有技术细节、代码和复现步骤均已公开。

Abstract: The computer vision domain has greatly benefited from an abundance of data
across many modalities to improve on various visual tasks. Recently, there has
been a lot of focus on self-supervised pre-training methods through Masked
Autoencoders (MAE) \cite{he2022masked,bachmann2022multimae}, usually used as a
first step before optimizing for a downstream task, such as classification or
regression. This is very useful as it doesn't require any manually labeled
data. In this work, we introduce Probabilistic Hyper-Graphs using Masked
Autoencoders (PHG-MAE): a novel model that unifies the classical work on neural
graphs \cite{leordeanu2021semi} with the modern approach of masked autoencoders
under a common theoretical framework. Through random masking of entire
modalities, not just patches, the model samples from the distribution of
hyper-edges on each forward pass. Additionally, the model adapts the standard
MAE algorithm by combining pre-training and fine-tuning into a single training
loop. Moreover, our approach enables the creation of inference-time ensembles
which, through aggregation, boost the final prediction performance and
consistency. Lastly, we show that we can apply knowledge distillation on top of
the ensembles with little loss in performance, even with models that have fewer
than 1M parameters. While our work mostly focuses on outdoor UAV scenes that
contain multiple world interpretations and modalities, the same steps can be
followed in other similar domains, such as autonomous driving or indoor
robotics. In order to streamline the process of integrating external

### [39] [Tracking the Spatiotemporal Evolution of Landslide Scars Using a Vision Foundation Model: A Novel and Universal Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10084)
*Meijun Zhou,Gang Mei,Zhengjing Ma,Nengxiong Xu,Jianbing Peng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于视觉基础模型的通用框架，用于追踪大规模滑坡疤痕的时空演化，通过将离散遥感图像重构为连续视频序列，实现滑坡演化过程的连续跟踪。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多关注单阶段或前后双阶段滑坡识别，难以追踪滑坡疤痕的时空演化过程，而这对理解演化机制和失效前兆至关重要。

Method: 将离散光学遥感图像重构为连续视频序列，利用为视频分割开发的视觉基础模型，在知识引导、自动传播和交互优化范式下实现滑坡疤痕的连续准确识别。

Result: 在巴格滑坡和色拉滑坡两个代表性案例中验证，框架能连续追踪滑坡疤痕，捕捉早期预警所需的失效前兆和评估次生灾害所需的灾后演化。

Conclusion: 该框架为大规模滑坡疤痕的时空演化追踪提供了有效解决方案，对早期预警和长期稳定性评估具有重要意义。

Abstract: Tracking the spatiotemporal evolution of large-scale landslide scars is
critical for understanding the evolution mechanisms and failure precursors,
enabling effective early-warning. However, most existing studies have focused
on single-phase or pre- and post-failure dual-phase landslide identification.
Although these approaches delineate post-failure landslide boundaries, it is
challenging to track the spatiotemporal evolution of landslide scars. To
address this problem, this study proposes a novel and universal framework for
tracking the spatiotemporal evolution of large-scale landslide scars using a
vision foundation model. The key idea behind the proposed framework is to
reconstruct discrete optical remote sensing images into a continuous video
sequence. This transformation enables a vision foundation model, which is
developed for video segmentation, to be used for tracking the evolution of
landslide scars. The proposed framework operates within a knowledge-guided,
auto-propagation, and interactive refinement paradigm to ensure the continuous
and accurate identification of landslide scars. The proposed framework was
validated through application to two representative cases: the post-failure
Baige landslide and the active Sela landslide (2017-2025). Results indicate
that the proposed framework enables continuous tracking of landslide scars,
capturing both failure precursors critical for early warning and post-failure
evolution essential for assessing secondary hazards and long-term stability.

*Jiahui Lu,Haihong Xiao,Xueyan Zhao,Wenxiong Kang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Gesplat是一个基于3D高斯泼溅的框架，能够从无姿态的稀疏图像中进行稳健的新视角合成和几何一致的重建，通过VGGT基础模型获取初始姿态和密集点云，结合混合高斯表示和深度正则化等技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NeRF和3DGS严重依赖准确的相机姿态和密集视角覆盖，限制了在稀疏视图设置中的应用，因为姿态估计不可靠且监督不足。

Method: 1) 使用VGGT基础模型获取可靠的初始姿态和密集点云；2) 结合双位置-形状优化的混合高斯表示，增强视图间匹配一致性；3) 图引导属性细化模块增强场景细节；4) 基于流的深度正则化提高深度估计精度。

Result: 在正向视角和大规模复杂数据集上的综合定量和定性实验表明，该方法相比其他无姿态方法实现了更稳健的性能。

Conclusion: Gesplat框架能够有效解决稀疏视图下的3D重建和新视角合成问题，为无姿态稀疏图像处理提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have advanced
3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis, but remain heavily dependent on
accurate camera poses and dense viewpoint coverage. These requirements limit
their applicability in sparse-view settings, where pose estimation becomes
unreliable and supervision is insufficient. To overcome these challenges, we
introduce Gesplat, a 3DGS-based framework that enables robust novel view
synthesis and geometrically consistent reconstruction from unposed sparse
images. Unlike prior works that rely on COLMAP for sparse point cloud
initialization, we leverage the VGGT foundation model to obtain more reliable
initial poses and dense point clouds. Our approach integrates several key
innovations: 1) a hybrid Gaussian representation with dual position-shape
optimization enhanced by inter-view matching consistency; 2) a graph-guided
attribute refinement module to enhance scene details; and 3) flow-based depth
regularization that improves depth estimation accuracy for more effective
supervision. Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate
that our approach achieves more robust performance on both forward-facing and
large-scale complex datasets compared to other pose-free methods.

*Kuangpu Guo,Lijun Sheng,Yongcan Yu,Jian Liang,Zilei Wang,Ran He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文首次将无监督联邦学习扩展到分类问题，提出了FedCoPL方法，利用CLIP模型和伪标签分布调整来解决全局类别不平衡问题，并通过部分提示聚合实现有效协作和个性化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的无监督联邦学习主要关注表示学习和聚类任务，而视觉语言模型（如CLIP）的零样本预测能力为分类问题提供了新的机会，但这一领域尚未被充分探索。

Method: 提出FedCoPL方法：客户端估计并上传伪标签分布，服务器调整并重新分发以避免全局类别不平衡；引入部分提示聚合协议，服务器聚合视觉提示，客户端保留文本提示以实现个性化和协作。

Result: 大量实验表明，FedCoPL在性能上优于基线方法。

Conclusion: FedCoPL成功地将无监督联邦学习应用于分类问题，通过伪标签分布调整和部分提示聚合实现了有效的协作学习和个性化。

Abstract: Unsupervised Federated Learning (UFL) aims to collaboratively train a global
model across distributed clients without sharing data or accessing label
information. Previous UFL works have predominantly focused on representation
learning and clustering tasks. Recently, vision language models (e.g., CLIP)
have gained significant attention for their powerful zero-shot prediction
capabilities. Leveraging this advancement, classification problems that were
previously infeasible under the UFL paradigm now present promising new
opportunities, yet remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we extend UFL to
the classification problem with CLIP for the first time and propose a novel
method, \underline{\textbf{Fed}}erated \underline{\textbf{Co}}operative
\underline{\textbf{P}}seudo \underline{\textbf{L}}abeling (\textbf{FedCoPL}).
Specifically, clients estimate and upload their pseudo label distribution, and
the server adjusts and redistributes them to avoid global imbalance among
classes. Moreover, we introduce a partial prompt aggregation protocol for
effective collaboration and personalization. In particular, visual prompts
containing general image features are aggregated at the server, while text
prompts encoding personalized knowledge are retained locally. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our FedCoPL compared to
baseline methods. Our code is available at

*Minbin Huang,Runhui Huang,Chuanyang Zheng,Jingyao Li,Guoxuan Chen,Han Shi,Hong Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了ACRE方法，通过一致性检查增强强化学习，解决大语言模型在推理过程中答案与推理链不一致的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准的基于结果的强化学习虽然提高了答案准确率，但会导致推理链与最终答案之间的不一致性，在实验中只有79.7%的一致性。

Method: 在GRPO算法基础上增加辅助一致性检查：模型生成推理链和初始答案后，打乱选项顺序，用相同推理链预测第二个答案，设计一致性验证奖励机制。

Result: 在视频推理和数学推理基准测试中，相比GRPO基线分别平均提升了2.2%和1.5%。

Conclusion: ACRE方法有效解决了推理-答案不一致问题，减少了模型对虚假模式（如选项顺序偏差）的依赖。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated that
reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) can significantly enhance
reasoning abilities by directly optimizing correctness, rather than relying
solely on supervised imitation. This paradigm has been extended to multimodal
LLMs for complex video and image understanding tasks. However, while
outcome-driven RL improves answer accuracy, it can inadvertently decouple the
reasoning chain from the final answer, leading to situations where models
produce inconsistency between the reasoning trace and final answer. In our
experiments on multiple-choice visual question-answering tasks, the standard
GRPO method yields only 79.7\% consistency on MMVU between the reasoning steps
and the chosen answers, indicating frequent mismatches between answers and
reasoning. To this end, we propose Answer-Consistent Reinforcement Learning
(ACRE) that modifies the GRPO algorithm with an auxiliary consistency check.
After the model generates a chain of thought and an initial answer for a given
question, we shuffle the answer options and prompt the model again with the
same reasoning trace to predict a second answer. We design a
consistency-verification reward that grants a high reward only if both the
original and the post-shuffle answers agree and are correct; otherwise, a lower
reward is assigned accordingly. This mechanism penalizes reasoning-answer
misalignment and discourages the model from relying on spurious patterns, such
as option ordering biases. We evaluate ACRE on challenging Video Reasoning
benchmarks and multimodal math reasoning benchmarks, achieving an average 2.2\%
and 1.5\% improvement for Video Reasoning and Math Reasoning tasks over the
GRPO baseline.

*Aniruddha Srinivas Joshi,Godwyn James William,Shreyas Srinivas Joshi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种不确定性感知的后检测框架，通过统计不确定性和视觉特征重新调整检测置信度，提升紧凑型深度学习模型在火灾烟雾检测中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于视觉的火灾烟雾检测方法在效率和可靠性之间存在平衡问题，紧凑型模型如YOLOv5n/YOLOv8n在部署时容易出现误报和漏检，传统后处理方法仅依赖空间重叠，在复杂场景中效果有限。

Method: 提出轻量级置信度精炼网络，结合不确定性估计与颜色、边缘、纹理等视觉特征来调整检测分数，无需修改基础模型。

Result: 在D-Fire数据集上的实验表明，相比现有基线方法，该方法在精度、召回率和平均精度方面均有提升，且计算开销较小。

Conclusion: 后检测重新评分能有效增强紧凑型深度学习模型在真实世界火灾烟雾检测中的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Accurate fire and smoke detection is critical for safety and disaster
response, yet existing vision-based methods face challenges in balancing
efficiency and reliability. Compact deep learning models such as YOLOv5n and
YOLOv8n are widely adopted for deployment on UAVs, CCTV systems, and IoT
devices, but their reduced capacity often results in false positives and missed
detections. Conventional post-detection methods such as Non-Maximum Suppression
and Soft-NMS rely only on spatial overlap, which can suppress true positives or
retain false alarms in cluttered or ambiguous fire scenes. To address these
limitations, we propose an uncertainty aware post-detection framework that
rescales detection confidences using both statistical uncertainty and domain
relevant visual cues. A lightweight Confidence Refinement Network integrates
uncertainty estimates with color, edge, and texture features to adjust
detection scores without modifying the base model. Experiments on the D-Fire
dataset demonstrate improved precision, recall, and mean average precision
compared to existing baselines, with only modest computational overhead. These
results highlight the effectiveness of post-detection rescoring in enhancing
the robustness of compact deep learning models for real-world fire and smoke
detection.

TL;DR: 提出了ICFC框架，利用多模态大语言模型进行无需训练的、可解释的图像篡改定位，在多个基准测试中超越了现有的无训练方法，并与弱监督和全监督方法竞争或更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图像篡改技术的进步带来严重安全威胁，需要有效的图像篡改定位方法。现有监督方法依赖昂贵的像素级标注，而弱监督或无训练替代方案性能不足且缺乏可解释性。

Method: ICFC框架包含：1）客观化规则构建与自适应过滤构建可靠知识库；2）多步渐进推理流程，从粗粒度提议到细粒度取证结果，模拟专家取证工作流。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，ICFC不仅超越了最先进的无训练方法，还实现了与弱监督和全监督方法竞争或更优的性能。

Conclusion: ICFC通过系统利用MLLM推理能力，实现了图像级分类、像素级定位和文本级可解释性的统一，为图像取证提供了无需训练的高效解决方案。

Abstract: Advances in image tampering pose serious security threats, underscoring the
need for effective image manipulation localization (IML). While supervised IML
achieves strong performance, it depends on costly pixel-level annotations.
Existing weakly supervised or training-free alternatives often underperform and
lack interpretability. We propose the In-Context Forensic Chain (ICFC), a
training-free framework that leverages multi-modal large language models
(MLLMs) for interpretable IML tasks. ICFC integrates an objectified rule
construction with adaptive filtering to build a reliable knowledge base and a
multi-step progressive reasoning pipeline that mirrors expert forensic
workflows from coarse proposals to fine-grained forensics results. This design
enables systematic exploitation of MLLM reasoning for image-level
classification, pixel-level localization, and text-level interpretability.
Across multiple benchmarks, ICFC not only surpasses state-of-the-art
training-free methods but also achieves competitive or superior performance
compared to weakly and fully supervised approaches.

*Yuxi Mi,Qiuyang Yuan,Zhizhou Zhong,Xuan Zhao,Jiaogen Zhou,Fubao Zhu,Jihong Guan,Shuigeng Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了ImmerIris数据集，这是目前最大的公开VR头显采集的离轴虹膜数据集，包含499,791张眼部图像和564个受试者。针对传统虹膜识别方法在沉浸式场景中表现不佳的问题，作者提出了无需归一化的新范式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 沉浸式应用（如AR/VR）中的虹膜识别面临独特挑战：离轴采集导致透视畸变、质量下降和类内纹理变化。现有数据集稀缺，传统方法依赖归一化处理在沉浸式场景中表现不佳。

Method: 构建ImmerIris大规模数据集，建立评估协议测试不同挑战因素下的识别方法。提出无需归一化的新范式，直接从眼部图像学习，仅需最小调整。

Result: 当前主要为经典轴上图像设计的方法在沉浸式设置中表现不理想。提出的无需归一化方法尽管简单，但始终优于基于归一化的方法。

Conclusion: 无需归一化的方法为鲁棒的沉浸式虹膜识别提供了有前景的方向，ImmerIris数据集填补了该领域的数据空白。

Abstract: In egocentric applications such as augmented and virtual reality, immersive
iris recognition is emerging as an accurate and seamless way to identify
persons. While classic systems acquire iris images on-axis, i.e., via dedicated
frontal sensors in controlled settings, the immersive setup primarily captures
off-axis irises through tilt-placed headset cameras, with only mild control in
open scenes. This yields unique challenges, including perspective distortion,
intensified quality degradations, and intra-class variations in iris texture.
Datasets capturing these challenges remain scarce. To fill this gap, this paper
introduces ImmerIris, a large-scale dataset collected via VR headsets,
containing 499,791 ocular images from 564 subjects. It is, to the best of
current knowledge, the largest public dataset and among the first dedicated to
off-axis acquisition. Based on ImmerIris, evaluation protocols are constructed
to benchmark recognition methods under different challenging factors. Current
methods, primarily designed for classic on-axis imagery, perform
unsatisfactorily on the immersive setup, mainly due to reliance on fallible
normalization. To this end, this paper further proposes a normalization-free
paradigm that directly learns from ocular images with minimal adjustment.
Despite its simplicity, this approach consistently outperforms
normalization-based counterparts, pointing to a promising direction for robust
immersive recognition.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于注意力增强CNN BiLSTM的多类帕金森病检测系统，通过手指敲击视频分析来评估疾病严重程度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于手势的帕金森病识别系统性能不理想，需要开发更准确的疾病严重程度评估方法以支持临床管理和干预发展。

Method: 收集手指敲击视频，提取时间、频率和振幅特征，构建混合深度学习框架整合CNN、BiLSTM和注意力机制进行多类PD严重程度分类。

Result: 该模型在区分五个严重程度类别方面表现出色，证明了整合时空表示与注意力机制的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法有望成为支持临床医生进行PD监测和进展跟踪的有前景的非侵入性工具。

Abstract: Effective clinical management and intervention development depend on accurate
evaluation of Parkinsons disease (PD) severity. Many researchers have worked on
developing gesture-based PD recognition systems; however, their performance
accuracy is not satisfactory. In this study, we propose a multi-class Parkinson
Disease detection system based on finger tapping using an attention-enhanced
CNN BiLSTM. We collected finger tapping videos and derived temporal, frequency,
and amplitude based features from wrist and hand movements. Then, we proposed a
hybrid deep learning framework integrating CNN, BiLSTM, and attention
mechanisms for multi-class PD severity classification from video-derived motion
features. First, the input sequence is reshaped and passed through a Conv1D
MaxPooling block to capture local spatial dependencies. The resulting feature
maps are fed into a BiLSTM layer to model temporal dynamics. An attention
mechanism focuses on the most informative temporal features, producing a
context vector that is further processed by a second BiLSTM layer. CNN-derived
features and attention-enhanced BiLSTM outputs are concatenated, followed by
dense and dropout layers, before the final softmax classifier outputs the
predicted PD severity level. The model demonstrated strong performance in
distinguishing between the five severity classes, suggesting that integrating
spatial temporal representations with attention mechanisms can improve
automated PD severity detection, making it a promising non-invasive tool to
support clinicians in PD monitoring and progression tracking.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低光图像增强和超分辨率任务中传统方法参数过多、计算量大且SSIM和PSNR指标较低的问题。

Method: 开发DeepFusionNet架构，使用自编码器方法而非GAN，参数数量大幅减少（低光增强约250万参数，超分辨率约10万参数）。

Result: 在LOL-v1数据集上，低光增强任务SSIM达92.8%，PSNR为26.30；超分辨率任务PSNR为25.30，SSIM为80.7%。

Conclusion: DeepFusionNet在保持轻量级的同时，显著提升了低光图像增强和超分辨率任务的性能表现。

Abstract: Computer vision and image processing applications suffer from dark and
low-light images, particularly during real-time image transmission. Currently,
low light and dark images are converted to bright and colored forms using
autoencoders; however, these methods often achieve low SSIM and PSNR scores and
require high computational power due to their large number of parameters. To
address these challenges, the DeepFusionNet architecture has been developed.
According to the results obtained with the LOL-v1 dataset, DeepFusionNet
achieved an SSIM of 92.8% and a PSNR score of 26.30, while containing only
approximately 2.5 million parameters. On the other hand, conversion of blurry
and low-resolution images into high-resolution and blur-free images has gained
importance in image processing applications. Unlike GAN-based super-resolution
methods, an autoencoder-based super resolution model has been developed that
contains approximately 100 thousand parameters and uses the DeepFusionNet
architecture. According to the results of the tests, the DeepFusionNet based
super-resolution method achieved a PSNR of 25.30 and a SSIM score of 80.7
percent according to the validation set.

Conclusion: YOLOv11-Litchi适用于复杂果园环境中的无人机荔枝检测，在精准农业中具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Litchi is a high-value fruit, yet traditional manual selection methods are
increasingly inadequate for modern production demands. Integrating UAV-based
aerial imagery with deep learning offers a promising solution to enhance
efficiency and reduce costs. This paper introduces YOLOv11-Litchi, a
lightweight and robust detection model specifically designed for UAV-based
litchi detection. Built upon the YOLOv11 framework, the proposed model
addresses key challenges such as small target size, large model parameters
hindering deployment, and frequent target occlusion. To tackle these issues,
three major innovations are incorporated: a multi-scale residual module to
improve contextual feature extraction across scales, a lightweight feature
fusion method to reduce model size and computational costs while maintaining
high accuracy, and a litchi occlusion detection head to mitigate occlusion
effects by emphasizing target regions and suppressing background interference.
Experimental results validate the model's effectiveness. YOLOv11-Litchi
achieves a parameter size of 6.35 MB - 32.5% smaller than the YOLOv11 baseline
- while improving mAP by 2.5% to 90.1% and F1-Score by 1.4% to 85.5%.
Additionally, the model achieves a frame rate of 57.2 FPS, meeting real-time
detection requirements. These findings demonstrate the suitability of
YOLOv11-Litchi for UAV-based litchi detection in complex orchard environments,
showcasing its potential for broader applications in precision agriculture.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Color3D是一个用于从单色输入中为静态和动态3D场景着色的高度适应性框架，通过个性化着色器实现跨视图和时间的一致性，同时保持色彩多样性和用户可控性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注静态场景，通过平均颜色变化来强制多视图一致性，但这会牺牲色彩丰富性和可控性。需要一种既能保持色彩多样性又能确保一致性的方法。

Method: 核心思路是仅对一个关键视图进行着色，然后微调个性化着色器将其颜色传播到新视图和时间步。通过个性化学习场景特定的确定性颜色映射，利用着色器的归纳偏置将对应颜色一致地投影到新视图和视频帧中。

Result: 在多样化的静态和动态3D着色基准测试中，该方法能够提供更一致且色彩丰富的渲染结果，并具有精确的用户控制能力。

Conclusion: 该框架巧妙地将复杂的3D着色问题重新表述为更易处理的单图像范式，允许无缝集成任意图像着色模型，具有增强的灵活性和可控性。

Abstract: In this work, we present Color3D, a highly adaptable framework for colorizing
both static and dynamic 3D scenes from monochromatic inputs, delivering
visually diverse and chromatically vibrant reconstructions with flexible
user-guided control. In contrast to existing methods that focus solely on
static scenarios and enforce multi-view consistency by averaging color
variations which inevitably sacrifice both chromatic richness and
controllability, our approach is able to preserve color diversity and
steerability while ensuring cross-view and cross-time consistency. In
particular, the core insight of our method is to colorize only a single key
view and then fine-tune a personalized colorizer to propagate its color to
novel views and time steps. Through personalization, the colorizer learns a
scene-specific deterministic color mapping underlying the reference view,
enabling it to consistently project corresponding colors to the content in
novel views and video frames via its inherent inductive bias. Once trained, the
personalized colorizer can be applied to infer consistent chrominance for all
other images, enabling direct reconstruction of colorful 3D scenes with a
dedicated Lab color space Gaussian splatting representation. The proposed
framework ingeniously recasts complicated 3D colorization as a more tractable
single image paradigm, allowing seamless integration of arbitrary image
colorization models with enhanced flexibility and controllability. Extensive
experiments across diverse static and dynamic 3D colorization benchmarks
substantiate that our method can deliver more consistent and chromatically rich
renderings with precise user control. Project Page

from MRI. Our implementation demonstrates promising results in localizing
occluded vessels on stroke-affected T1 MRI scans, with potential for faster and

Motivation: 现有方法难以在单一框架中统一字符一致性生成和编辑任务。生成方法难以保持细粒度身份一致性，而编辑方法容易失去空间可控性和指令对齐。

Method: ReMix模块利用MLLMs的多模态推理能力编辑输入图像的语义特征，IP-ControlNet扩展ControlNet来解耦参考图像的语义和布局线索，并在共享噪声空间中联合去噪参考图像和目标图像。

Conclusion: ReMix成功构建了一个统一的字符一致性图像生成和编辑框架，解决了现有方法的局限性，在保持身份一致性的同时实现了更好的空间可控性。

Abstract: Recent advances in large-scale text-to-image diffusion models (e.g., FLUX.1)
have greatly improved visual fidelity in consistent character generation and
editing. However, existing methods rarely unify these tasks within a single
framework. Generation-based approaches struggle with fine-grained identity
consistency across instances, while editing-based methods often lose spatial
controllability and instruction alignment. To bridge this gap, we propose
ReMix, a unified framework for character-consistent generation and editing. It
constitutes two core components: the ReMix Module and IP-ControlNet. The ReMix
Module leverages the multimodal reasoning ability of MLLMs to edit semantic
features of input images and adapt instruction embeddings to the native DiT
backbone without fine-tuning. While this ensures coherent semantic layouts,
pixel-level consistency and pose controllability remain challenging. To address
this, IP-ControlNet extends ControlNet to decouple semantic and layout cues
from reference images and introduces an {\epsilon}-equivariant latent space
that jointly denoises the reference and target images within a shared noise
space. Inspired by convergent evolution and quantum decoherence,i.e., where
environmental noise drives state convergence, this design promotes feature
alignment in the hidden space, enabling consistent object generation while
preserving identity. ReMix supports a wide range of tasks, including
personalized generation, image editing, style transfer, and multi-condition
synthesis. Extensive experiments validate its effectiveness and efficiency as a
unified framework for character-consistent image generation and editing.

Abstract: Referring Image Segmentation (RIS) aims to segment the target object in an
image given a natural language expression. While recent methods leverage
pre-trained vision backbones and more training corpus to achieve impressive
results, they predominantly focus on simple expressions--short, clear noun
phrases like "red car" or "left girl". This simplification often reduces RIS to
a key word/concept matching problem, limiting the model's ability to handle
referential ambiguity in expressions. In this work, we identify two challenging
real-world scenarios: object-distracting expressions, which involve multiple
entities with contextual cues, and category-implicit expressions, where the
object class is not explicitly stated. To address the challenges, we propose a
novel framework, SaFiRe, which mimics the human two-phase cognitive
process--first forming a global understanding, then refining it through
detail-oriented inspection. This is naturally supported by Mamba's
scan-then-update property, which aligns with our phased design and enables
efficient multi-cycle refinement with linear complexity. We further introduce
aRefCOCO, a new benchmark designed to evaluate RIS models under ambiguous
referring expressions. Extensive experiments on both standard and proposed
datasets demonstrate the superiority of SaFiRe over state-of-the-art baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下图像语义分割对生态监测至关重要，但获取密集专家标注成本高昂，而稀疏点标注虽然容易获取，但面临标注点选择和稀疏信息传播的挑战。

Method: 采用主动采样策略指导标注者选择最有价值的点，然后结合SAM2和超像素方法的混合方法传播稀疏标签。

Result: 在两个不同的水下数据集上，SparseUWSeg优于现有方法，相比D+NN实现了高达+5%的mIoU提升。

Conclusion: 开发并发布了一个简单有效的交互式标注工具，使生态研究人员能够利用基础模型和计算机视觉高效生成高质量分割掩码。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation is essential to automate underwater imagery analysis
with ecology monitoring purposes. Unfortunately, fine grained underwater scene
analysis is still an open problem even for top performing segmentation models.
The high cost of obtaining dense, expert-annotated, segmentation labels hinders
the supervision of models in this domain. While sparse point-labels are easier
to obtain, they introduce challenges regarding which points to annotate and how
to propagate the sparse information. We present SparseUWSeg, a novel framework
that addresses both issues. SparseUWSeg employs an active sampling strategy to
guide annotators, maximizing the value of their point labels. Then, it
propagates these sparse labels with a hybrid approach leverages both the best
of SAM2 and superpixel-based methods. Experiments on two diverse underwater
datasets demonstrate the benefits of SparseUWSeg over state-of-the-art
approaches, achieving up to +5\% mIoU over D+NN. Our main contribution is the
design and release of a simple but effective interactive annotation tool,
integrating our algorithms. It enables ecology researchers to leverage
foundation models and computer vision to efficiently generate high-quality
segmentation masks to process their data.

TL;DR: ViConEx-Med是一个基于Transformer的可视化概念解释框架，通过多概念可学习token同时预测和定位视觉概念，在医学应用中提供概念级定位图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有概念模型将概念视为数值属性，缺乏可视化解释来定位预测概念，限制了在真实世界特别是高风险医学场景中的应用。

Method: 提出基于Transformer的框架，引入多概念可学习token，利用专门的注意力层处理视觉和文本概念token，生成概念级定位图。

Result: 在合成和真实医学数据集上的实验表明，ViConEx-Med在概念检测和定位精度方面优于现有概念模型，与黑盒模型性能相当。

Conclusion: 该方法为构建基于视觉概念的内在可解释模型提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Concept-based models aim to explain model decisions with human-understandable
concepts. However, most existing approaches treat concepts as numerical
attributes, without providing complementary visual explanations that could
localize the predicted concepts. This limits their utility in real-world
applications and particularly in high-stakes scenarios, such as medical
use-cases. This paper proposes ViConEx-Med, a novel transformer-based framework
for visual concept explainability, which introduces multi-concept learnable
tokens to jointly predict and localize visual concepts. By leveraging
specialized attention layers for processing visual and text-based concept
tokens, our method produces concept-level localization maps while maintaining
high predictive accuracy. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world medical
datasets demonstrate that ViConEx-Med outperforms prior concept-based models
and achieves competitive performance with black-box models in terms of both
concept detection and localization precision. Our results suggest a promising
direction for building inherently interpretable models grounded in visual
concepts. Code is publicly available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种新的姿态估计方法，通过预测物体前后表面的3D坐标并在其间密集采样，创建超密集的2D-3D对应关系，结合分层连续坐标编码(HCCE)来提高姿态估计精度。


<details>

Motivation: 现有姿态估计方法主要关注物体前表面的3D坐标预测精度，忽视了利用物体后表面和内部信息的潜力。为了充分利用物体的完整表面和内部信息，本研究探索了包含前后表面和内部采样的方法。

Method: 预测物体前后表面的3D坐标，并在其间密集采样3D坐标，创建超密集的2D-3D对应关系；提出分层连续坐标编码(HCCE)来更准确高效地表示前后表面坐标。

Result: 在BOP网站的七个经典核心数据集上，该方法优于现有的最先进方法，展现出更高的姿态估计精度。

Conclusion: 通过利用物体完整表面和内部信息创建超密集对应关系，结合高效坐标编码，可以显著提升姿态估计的准确性。

Abstract: In pose estimation for seen objects, a prevalent pipeline involves using
neural networks to predict dense 3D coordinates of the object surface on 2D
images, which are then used to establish dense 2D-3D correspondences. However,
current methods primarily focus on more efficient encoding techniques to
improve the precision of predicted 3D coordinates on the object's front
surface, overlooking the potential benefits of incorporating the back surface
and interior of the object. To better utilize the full surface and interior of
the object, this study predicts 3D coordinates of both the object's front and
back surfaces and densely samples 3D coordinates between them. This process
creates ultra-dense 2D-3D correspondences, effectively enhancing pose
estimation accuracy based on the Perspective-n-Point (PnP) algorithm.
Additionally, we propose Hierarchical Continuous Coordinate Encoding (HCCE) to
provide a more accurate and efficient representation of front and back surface
coordinates. Experimental results show that, compared to existing
state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on the BOP website, the proposed approach
outperforms across seven classic BOP core datasets. Code is available at

Motivation: 无人机视频数据量大，现有文本-视频检索方法在无人机领域研究不足，现有数据集存在标注粗糙冗余的问题

Method: 构建DVTMD数据集，提出TCMA框架，包含全局视频-句子对齐、句子引导帧聚合、单词引导补丁对齐，以及单词和补丁选择模块、文本自适应动态温度机制

Result: 在DVTMD和CapERA数据集上建立首个完整的无人机文本-视频检索基准，TCMA在文本到视频检索中达到45.5% R@1，视频到文本检索中达到42.8% R@1

Conclusion: 提出的数据集和TCMA框架有效解决了无人机视频文本检索问题，为无人机视频内容检索提供了新基准

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have become powerful platforms for real-time,
high-resolution data collection, producing massive volumes of aerial videos.
Efficient retrieval of relevant content from these videos is crucial for
applications in urban management, emergency response, security, and disaster
relief. While text-video retrieval has advanced in natural video domains, the
UAV domain remains underexplored due to limitations in existing datasets, such
as coarse and redundant captions. Thus, in this work, we construct the Drone
Video-Text Match Dataset (DVTMD), which contains 2,864 videos and 14,320
fine-grained, semantically diverse captions. The annotations capture multiple
complementary aspects, including human actions, objects, background settings,
environmental conditions, and visual style, thereby enhancing text-video
correspondence and reducing redundancy. Building on this dataset, we propose
the Text-Conditioned Multi-granularity Alignment (TCMA) framework, which
integrates global video-sentence alignment, sentence-guided frame aggregation,
and word-guided patch alignment. To further refine local alignment, we design a
Word and Patch Selection module that filters irrelevant content, as well as a
Text-Adaptive Dynamic Temperature Mechanism that adapts attention sharpness to
text type. Extensive experiments on DVTMD and CapERA establish the first
complete benchmark for drone text-video retrieval. Our TCMA achieves
state-of-the-art performance, including 45.5% R@1 in text-to-video and 42.8%
R@1 in video-to-text retrieval, demonstrating the effectiveness of our dataset
and method. The code and dataset will be released.

*Haohua Dong,Ana Manzano Rodríguez,Camille Guinaudeau,Shin'ichi Satoh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为伪平衡的方法，用于在半监督学习中缓解人脸性别分类模型的偏见问题，通过无标签图像实现人口统计平衡，显著提高了公平性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人脸性别分类模型经常反映并放大训练数据中的人口统计偏见，导致在不同性别和种族子群体中表现不均。需要一种简单有效的方法来减轻这些偏见，特别是在缺乏真实标签的情况下。

Method: 引入伪平衡策略，在伪标签选择过程中强制执行人口统计平衡，仅使用来自种族平衡数据集的无标签图像，无需访问真实注释。通过微调有偏见的性别分类器和在故意不平衡的训练数据上进行压力测试来评估方法。

Result: 伪平衡方法在保持或提高准确性的同时持续改善公平性。总体准确率达到79.81%，比基线提高6.53%，性别准确率差距减少44.17%。在东亚子群体中，基线差距超过49%，通过该方法缩小到仅5.01%。

Conclusion: 即使在缺乏标签监督的情况下，访问人口统计平衡或适度倾斜的无标签数据集可以作为消除现有计算机视觉模型偏见的有力资源。

Abstract: Face gender classification models often reflect and amplify demographic
biases present in their training data, leading to uneven performance across
gender and racial subgroups. We introduce pseudo-balancing, a simple and
effective strategy for mitigating such biases in semi-supervised learning. Our
method enforces demographic balance during pseudo-label selection, using only
unlabeled images from a race-balanced dataset without requiring access to
ground-truth annotations.
  We evaluate pseudo-balancing under two conditions: (1) fine-tuning a biased
gender classifier using unlabeled images from the FairFace dataset, and (2)
stress-testing the method with intentionally imbalanced training data to
simulate controlled bias scenarios. In both cases, models are evaluated on the
All-Age-Faces (AAF) benchmark, which contains a predominantly East Asian
population. Our results show that pseudo-balancing consistently improves
fairness while preserving or enhancing accuracy. The method achieves 79.81%
overall accuracy - a 6.53% improvement over the baseline - and reduces the
gender accuracy gap by 44.17%. In the East Asian subgroup, where baseline
disparities exceeded 49%, the gap is narrowed to just 5.01%. These findings
suggest that even in the absence of label supervision, access to a
demographically balanced or moderately skewed unlabeled dataset can serve as a
powerful resource for debiasing existing computer vision models.

TL;DR: 提出了一种渐进式关系学习框架，将关系学习从二元扩展到n元，用于3D物体定位，通过分组监督损失和混合注意力机制实现多模态关系理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法仅建模成对物体关系，忽略了n元组合在多模态关系理解中的全局感知重要性，导致3D-语言对齐困难。

Method: 扩展关系学习从二元到n元，设计分组监督损失促进n元关系学习，在n元关系场景图中使用带混合注意力机制的多模态网络定位目标。

Result: 在ReferIt3D和ScanRefer基准测试中优于现有最先进方法，证明了n元关系感知在3D定位中的优势。

Conclusion: n元关系学习能够更好地匹配指称描述的全局视觉关系，显著提升3D物体定位性能。

Abstract: Localizing 3D objects using natural language is essential for robotic scene
understanding. The descriptions often involve multiple spatial relationships to
distinguish similar objects, making 3D-language alignment difficult. Current
methods only model relationships for pairwise objects, ignoring the global
perceptual significance of n-ary combinations in multi-modal relational
understanding. To address this, we propose a novel progressive relational
learning framework for 3D object grounding. We extend relational learning from
binary to n-ary to identify visual relations that match the referential
description globally. Given the absence of specific annotations for referred
objects in the training data, we design a grouped supervision loss to
facilitate n-ary relational learning. In the scene graph created with n-ary
relationships, we use a multi-modal network with hybrid attention mechanisms to
further localize the target within the n-ary combinations. Experiments and
ablation studies on the ReferIt3D and ScanRefer benchmarks demonstrate that our
method outperforms the state-of-the-art, and proves the advantages of the n-ary
relational perception in 3D localization.

Abstract: Cervical cancer remains a major malignancy, necessitating extensive and
complex histopathological assessments and comprehensive support tools. Although
deep learning shows promise, these models still lack accuracy and
generalizability. General foundation models offer a broader reach but remain
limited in capturing subspecialty-specific features and task adaptability. We
introduce the Cervical Subspecialty Pathology (CerS-Path) diagnostic system,
developed through two synergistic pretraining stages: self-supervised learning
on approximately 190 million tissue patches from 140,000 slides to build a
cervical-specific feature extractor, and multimodal enhancement with 2.5
million image-text pairs, followed by integration with multiple downstream
diagnostic functions. Supporting eight diagnostic functions, including rare
cancer classification and multimodal Q&A, CerS-Path surpasses prior foundation
models in scope and clinical applicability. Comprehensive evaluations
demonstrate a significant advance in cervical pathology, with prospective
testing on 3,173 cases across five centers maintaining 99.38% screening
sensitivity and excellent generalizability, highlighting its potential for
subspecialty diagnostic translation and cervical cancer screening.

Abstract: Ensuring the reliability of autonomous driving perception systems requires
extensive environment-based testing, yet real-world execution is often
impractical. Synthetic datasets have therefore emerged as a promising
alternative, offering advantages such as cost-effectiveness, bias free
labeling, and controllable scenarios. However, the domain gap between synthetic
and real-world datasets remains a critical bottleneck for the generalization of
AI-based autonomous driving models. Quantifying this synthetic-to-real gap is
thus essential for evaluating dataset utility and guiding the design of more
effective training pipelines. In this paper, we establish a systematic
framework for quantifying the synthetic-to-real gap in autonomous driving
systems, and propose Style Embedding Distribution Discrepancy (SEDD) as a novel
evaluation metric. Our framework combines Gram matrix-based style extraction
with metric learning optimized for intra-class compactness and inter-class
separation to extract style embeddings. Furthermore, we establish a benchmark
using publicly available datasets. Experiments are conducted on a variety of
datasets and sim-to-real methods, and the results show that our method is
capable of quantifying the synthetic-to-real gap. This work provides a
standardized quality control tool that enables systematic diagnosis and
targeted enhancement of synthetic datasets, advancing future development of
data-driven autonomous driving systems.

Motivation: AIGC图像常存在语义异常（如不合理物体配置、违反物理定律等），影响可信度，需要系统性的语义异常检测方法来评估AIGC媒体的可信性。

Method: 使用多智能体管道AnomAgent进行大规模结构化四元组标注（名称、现象、推理、严重程度），结合轻量级人工验证，处理了约41.7亿GPT-4o token。

Conclusion: AnomReason和AnomAgent为测量和改进AI生成图像的语义合理性提供了基础，支持语义真实性和可解释AIGC取证的可复现研究。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of
  AI-generated content (AIGC) has enabled the synthesis of visually convincing
images; however, many such outputs exhibit subtle \textbf{semantic anomalies},
including unrealistic object configurations, violations of physical laws, or
commonsense inconsistencies, which compromise the overall plausibility of the
generated scenes. Detecting these semantic-level anomalies
  is essential for assessing the trustworthiness of AIGC media, especially in
AIGC image analysis, explainable deepfake detection and semantic authenticity
assessment. In this paper,
  we formalize \textbf{semantic anomaly detection and reasoning} for AIGC
images and
  introduce \textbf{AnomReason}, a large-scale benchmark with structured
annotations as quadruples \emph{(Name, Phenomenon, Reasoning, Severity)}.
Annotations are produced by
  a modular multi-agent pipeline (\textbf{AnomAgent}) with lightweight
human-in-the-loop verification, enabling scale while preserving quality.
  At construction time, AnomAgent processed approximately 4.17\,B GPT-4o
tokens, providing scale evidence for the resulting structured annotations. We
further
  show that models fine-tuned on AnomReason achieve consistent gains over
strong vision-language baselines under our proposed semantic matching metric
(\textit{SemAP} and \textit{SemF1}).
  Applications to {explainable deepfake detection} and {semantic reasonableness
assessment of image generators} demonstrate practical utility. In summary,
AnomReason and AnomAgent
  serve as a foundation for measuring and improving the semantic plausibility
of AI-generated images. We will release code, metrics, data, and task-aligned
models to support reproducible research on semantic authenticity and
interpretable AIGC forensics.

Conclusion: 医学视频建模中出现了零样本能力，通用视频模型有潜力作为统一学习器和推理器，为未来基于视频模型的医学基础模型奠定基础。

Abstract: Recent advances in large generative models have shown that simple
autoregressive formulations, when scaled appropriately, can exhibit strong
zero-shot generalization across domains. Motivated by this trend, we
investigate whether autoregressive video modeling principles can be directly
applied to medical imaging tasks, despite the model never being trained on
medical data. Specifically, we evaluate a large vision model (LVM) in a
zero-shot setting across four representative tasks: organ segmentation,
denoising, super-resolution, and motion prediction. Remarkably, even without
domain-specific fine-tuning, the LVM can delineate anatomical structures in CT
scans and achieve competitive performance on segmentation, denoising, and
super-resolution. Most notably, in radiotherapy motion prediction, the model
forecasts future 3D CT phases directly from prior phases of a 4D CT scan,
producing anatomically consistent predictions that capture patient-specific
respiratory dynamics with realistic temporal coherence. We evaluate the LVM on
4D CT data from 122 patients, totaling over 1,820 3D CT volumes. Despite no
prior exposure to medical data, the model achieves strong performance across
all tasks and surpasses specialized DVF-based and generative baselines in
motion prediction, achieving state-of-the-art spatial accuracy. These findings
reveal the emergence of zero-shot capabilities in medical video modeling and
highlight the potential of general-purpose video models to serve as unified
learners and reasoners laying the groundwork for future medical foundation
models built on video models.

TL;DR: 提出一个改进3D高斯泼溅在少样本场景下效率的框架，通过使用不透明度梯度作为渲染误差的轻量级代理来触发密集化，结合保守的剪枝策略和深度相关损失，显著减少基元数量同时保持重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯泼溅在少样本场景中容易过拟合并产生臃肿的重建结果，现有方法如FSGS虽然提高了质量但显著增加了基元数量。本文旨在优化3DGS的核心优化过程以优先考虑效率。

Method: 1. 用基于不透明度梯度的新密集化触发器替代标准位置梯度启发式方法；2. 采用更保守的剪枝策略防止破坏性优化循环；3. 结合标准深度相关损失提供几何指导。

Result: 在3-view LLFF数据集上，模型比FSGS紧凑40%以上（32k vs. 57k基元）；在Mip-NeRF 360数据集上实现约70%的减少。在紧凑性显著提升的同时，重建指标仅有适度折衷。

Conclusion: 该框架在少样本视图合成的质量与效率帕累托前沿上建立了新的最先进水平，证明了在3D高斯泼溅优化中效率优先方法的有效性。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) struggles in few-shot scenarios, where its
standard adaptive density control (ADC) can lead to overfitting and bloated
reconstructions. While state-of-the-art methods like FSGS improve quality, they
often do so by significantly increasing the primitive count. This paper
presents a framework that revises the core 3DGS optimization to prioritize
efficiency. We replace the standard positional gradient heuristic with a novel
densification trigger that uses the opacity gradient as a lightweight proxy for
rendering error. We find this aggressive densification is only effective when
paired with a more conservative pruning schedule, which prevents destructive
optimization cycles. Combined with a standard depth-correlation loss for
geometric guidance, our framework demonstrates a fundamental improvement in
efficiency. On the 3-view LLFF dataset, our model is over 40% more compact (32k
vs. 57k primitives) than FSGS, and on the Mip-NeRF 360 dataset, it achieves a
reduction of approximately 70%. This dramatic gain in compactness is achieved
with a modest trade-off in reconstruction metrics, establishing a new
state-of-the-art on the quality-vs-efficiency Pareto frontier for few-shot view
synthesis.

TL;DR: VividAnimator是一个端到端的音频和稀疏手部姿态驱动的人体动画框架，通过预训练手部清晰度码本、双流音频感知模块和姿态校准技巧，解决了现有方法中头部运动僵硬和手部模糊的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有音频和姿态驱动的人体动画方法存在头部运动僵硬和手部模糊的问题，主要原因是音频与头部运动相关性弱，以及手部结构复杂。

Method: 1. 预训练手部清晰度码本(HCC)编码高保真手部纹理先验；2. 双流音频感知模块(DSAA)分别建模唇部同步和自然头部姿态动态；3. 姿态校准技巧(PCT)通过放松刚性约束来优化和对齐姿态条件。

Result: 大量实验表明VividAnimator达到最先进性能，生成具有优越手部细节、手势真实性和身份一致性的视频，通过定量指标和定性评估验证。

Conclusion: VividAnimator通过三个关键创新有效解决了音频和姿态驱动人体动画中的核心问题，能够生成高质量、自然流畅的半身人体动画。

Abstract: Existing for audio- and pose-driven human animation methods often struggle
with stiff head movements and blurry hands, primarily due to the weak
correlation between audio and head movements and the structural complexity of
hands. To address these issues, we propose VividAnimator, an end-to-end
framework for generating high-quality, half-body human animations driven by
audio and sparse hand pose conditions. Our framework introduces three key
innovations. First, to overcome the instability and high cost of online
codebook training, we pre-train a Hand Clarity Codebook (HCC) that encodes
rich, high-fidelity hand texture priors, significantly mitigating hand
degradation. Second, we design a Dual-Stream Audio-Aware Module (DSAA) to model
lip synchronization and natural head pose dynamics separately while enabling
interaction. Third, we introduce a Pose Calibration Trick (PCT) that refines
and aligns pose conditions by relaxing rigid constraints, ensuring smooth and
natural gesture transitions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Vivid
Animator achieves state-of-the-art performance, producing videos with superior
hand detail, gesture realism, and identity consistency, validated by both
quantitative metrics and qualitative evaluations.

TL;DR: DualViewDistill是一个结合透视视图和鸟瞰图特征的3D目标检测与跟踪框架，通过基础模型引导的BEV映射和特征蒸馏，在nuScenes和Argoverse 2基准测试中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法通常只使用透视视图或鸟瞰图特征，无法同时利用细粒度目标细节和空间结构化场景表示，限制了感知能力。

Method: 提出混合检测跟踪框架，集成PV和BEV相机图像特征，通过基础模型引导的BEV映射，将DINOv2特征蒸馏到BEV表示中，使用可变形聚合增强3D检测跟踪。

Result: 在nuScenes和Argoverse 2基准测试中实现最先进性能，证明了基础模型BEV映射在自动驾驶感知中的潜力。

Conclusion: DualViewDistill展示了结合PV和BEV特征的混合表示方法能够显著提升3D目标检测和跟踪性能，为自动驾驶提供更可靠的感知能力。

Abstract: Camera-based 3D object detection and tracking are essential for perception in
autonomous driving. Current state-of-the-art approaches often rely exclusively
on either perspective-view (PV) or bird's-eye-view (BEV) features, limiting
their ability to leverage both fine-grained object details and spatially
structured scene representations. In this work, we propose DualViewDistill, a
hybrid detection and tracking framework that incorporates both PV and BEV
camera image features to leverage their complementary strengths. Our approach
introduces BEV maps guided by foundation models, leveraging descriptive DINOv2
features that are distilled into BEV representations through a novel
distillation process. By integrating PV features with BEV maps enriched with
semantic and geometric features from DINOv2, our model leverages this hybrid
representation via deformable aggregation to enhance 3D object detection and
tracking. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes and Argoverse 2 benchmarks
demonstrate that DualViewDistill achieves state-of-the-art performance. The
results showcase the potential of foundation model BEV maps to enable more
reliable perception for autonomous driving. We make the code and pre-trained
models available at https://dualviewdistill.cs.uni-freiburg.de .

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM2虽然在低资源设置下能快速推理，但微调仍然具有挑战性，需要解决参数效率问题。

Method: 在图像编码器和掩码解码器中集成低秩适配器，使用结合分割BCE、SoftDice和FocalTversky损失的复合损失函数进行网络优化。

Result: 在11个具有挑战性的眼底分割数据集上评估，SAM2LoRA在跨数据集训练条件下，在血管和视盘分割方面表现出高性能，Dice分数分别达到0.86和0.93，AUC值分别达到0.98和0.99。

Abstract: We propose SAM2LoRA, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategy that adapts
the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) for fundus image segmentation. SAM2 employs
a masked autoencoder-pretrained Hierarchical Vision Transformer for multi-scale
feature decoding, enabling rapid inference in low-resource settings; however,
fine-tuning remains challenging. To address this, SAM2LoRA integrates a
low-rank adapter into both the image encoder and mask decoder, requiring fewer
than 5\% of the original trainable parameters. Our analysis indicates that for
cross-dataset fundus segmentation tasks, a composite loss function combining
segmentationBCE, SoftDice, and FocalTversky losses is essential for optimal
network tuning. Evaluated on 11 challenging fundus segmentation datasets,
SAM2LoRA demonstrates high performance in both blood vessel and optic disc
segmentation under cross-dataset training conditions. It achieves Dice scores
of up to 0.86 and 0.93 for blood vessel and optic disc segmentation,
respectively, and AUC values of up to 0.98 and 0.99, achieving state-of-the-art
performance while substantially reducing training overhead.

TL;DR: FactoredScenes是一个通过分解场景为层次化概念来合成真实3D场景的框架，利用房间结构和物体姿态变化生成逼真的室内场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界场景（如ScanNet）难以捕捉且数据有限，生成具有多样化物体姿态的真实场景仍然是一个具有挑战性的开放问题。

Method: 引入分解表示法，将场景分解为层次化组织的房间程序和物体姿态概念；学习可重用布局模式的函数库；使用大语言模型生成高级程序；学习程序条件模型来分层预测物体姿态并检索放置3D物体。

Result: FactoredScenes生成了难以与真实ScanNet场景区分的逼真现实世界房间。

Conclusion: 该框架成功实现了通过分解场景结构和学习物体姿态变化来生成高质量3D室内场景的目标。

Abstract: Real-world scenes, such as those in ScanNet, are difficult to capture, with
highly limited data available. Generating realistic scenes with varied object
poses remains an open and challenging task. In this work, we propose
FactoredScenes, a framework that synthesizes realistic 3D scenes by leveraging
the underlying structure of rooms while learning the variation of object poses
from lived-in scenes. We introduce a factored representation that decomposes
scenes into hierarchically organized concepts of room programs and object
poses. To encode structure, FactoredScenes learns a library of functions
capturing reusable layout patterns from which scenes are drawn, then uses large
language models to generate high-level programs, regularized by the learned
library. To represent scene variations, FactoredScenes learns a
program-conditioned model to hierarchically predict object poses, and retrieves
and places 3D objects in a scene. We show that FactoredScenes generates
realistic, real-world rooms that are difficult to distinguish from real ScanNet
scenes.

Abstract: Accurate traffic congestion classification is essential for intelligent
transportation systems and real-time urban traffic management. This paper
presents a multimodal framework combining open-vocabulary visual-language
reasoning (CLIP), object detection (YOLO-World), and motion analysis via
MOG2-based background subtraction. The system predicts congestion levels on an
ordinal scale from 1 (free flow) to 5 (severe congestion), enabling
semantically aligned and temporally consistent classification. To enhance
interpretability, we incorporate motion-based confidence weighting and generate
annotated visual outputs. Experimental results show the model achieves 76.7

demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in preserving ordinal structure and
leveraging visual-language and motion modalities. Future enhancements include
incorporating vehicle sizing and refined density metrics.

TL;DR: Ortho-Fuse是一个基于光流的框架，能够在图像重叠度较低的情况下生成可靠的农作物健康正射影像，将最小重叠需求降低了20%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI驱动的作物健康监测系统虽然具有数据获取快、成本低的优势，但由于稀疏航拍图像数据集生成正射影像的技术限制，农民采用率仍然受限。传统方法需要70-80%的图像重叠度，而资源受限的AI系统难以持续达到这一要求。

Method: 采用基于光流的方法，通过中间流估计在连续航拍帧之间合成过渡图像，人工增强特征对应关系以改进几何重建。

Result: 实验验证表明，该方法将最小重叠需求降低了20%。

Conclusion: Ortho-Fuse框架能够有效降低正射影像生成的重叠度要求，为AI驱动的监测系统在精准农业中的更好集成提供了可行路径。

Abstract: AI-driven crop health mapping systems offer substantial advantages over
conventional monitoring approaches through accelerated data acquisition and
cost reduction. However, widespread farmer adoption remains constrained by
technical limitations in orthomosaic generation from sparse aerial imagery
datasets. Traditional photogrammetric reconstruction requires 70-80\%
inter-image overlap to establish sufficient feature correspondences for
accurate geometric registration. AI-driven systems operating under
resource-constrained conditions cannot consistently achieve these overlap
thresholds, resulting in degraded reconstruction quality that undermines user
confidence in autonomous monitoring technologies. In this paper, we present
Ortho-Fuse, an optical flow-based framework that enables the generation of a
reliable orthomosaic with reduced overlap requirements. Our approach employs
intermediate flow estimation to synthesize transitional imagery between
consecutive aerial frames, artificially augmenting feature correspondences for
improved geometric reconstruction. Experimental validation demonstrates a 20\%
reduction in minimum overlap requirements. We further analyze adoption barriers
in precision agriculture to identify pathways for enhanced integration of
AI-driven monitoring systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有点云补全模型依赖训练时学到的归纳偏置，无法在测试时适应新的结构模式和传感器引起的失真，限制了在安全关键应用中的鲁棒性。

Method: 提出基于MAML的元辅助学习策略，通过两个自监督辅助目标（模拟结构和传感器级不完整性）优化补全模型，并在推理时动态调整共享编码器，同时引入自适应λ校准机制平衡梯度。

Result: 在合成、模拟和真实数据集上的广泛实验表明，PointMAC通过逐样本细化实现了最先进的高质量补全结果。

Conclusion: 这是首个将元辅助测试时自适应应用于点云补全的工作，显著提升了模型对未知模式和失真的适应能力。

Abstract: Point cloud completion is essential for robust 3D perception in
safety-critical applications such as robotics and augmented reality. However,
existing models perform static inference and rely heavily on inductive biases
learned during training, limiting their ability to adapt to novel structural
patterns and sensor-induced distortions at test time. To address this
limitation, we propose PointMAC, a meta-learned framework for robust test-time
adaptation in point cloud completion. It enables sample-specific refinement
without requiring additional supervision. Our method optimizes the completion
model under two self-supervised auxiliary objectives that simulate structural
and sensor-level incompleteness. A meta-auxiliary learning strategy based on
Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) ensures that adaptation driven by auxiliary
objectives is consistently aligned with the primary completion task. During
inference, we adapt the shared encoder on-the-fly by optimizing auxiliary
losses, with the decoder kept fixed. To further stabilize adaptation, we
introduce Adaptive $\lambda$-Calibration, a meta-learned mechanism for
balancing gradients between primary and auxiliary objectives. Extensive
experiments on synthetic, simulated, and real-world datasets demonstrate that
PointMAC achieves state-of-the-art results by refining each sample individually
to produce high-quality completions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first work to apply meta-auxiliary test-time adaptation to point cloud
completion.

Motivation: 现有的生理信号处理主要使用专门的基础模型或时间序列模型，但研究发现视觉基础模型通过简单的信号转换也能在生理任务中取得优异表现。

Method: 将一维PPG信号通过短时傅里叶变换(STFT)等转换为二维图像表示，然后使用DINOv3、SIGLIP-2等最新视觉基础模型进行参数高效微调(PEFT)。

Conclusion: Vision4PPG解锁了视觉基础模型在PPG信号处理中的新应用，为临床科学家提供了计算高效且性能优越的新工具集。

Abstract: Photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor in wearable and clinical devices provides
valuable physiological insights in a non-invasive and real-time fashion.
Specialized Foundation Models (FM) or repurposed time-series FMs are used to
benchmark physiological tasks. Our experiments with fine-tuning FMs reveal that
Vision FM (VFM) can also be utilized for this purpose and, in fact,
surprisingly leads to state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on many tasks,
notably blood pressure estimation. We leverage VFMs by simply transforming
one-dimensional PPG signals into image-like two-dimensional representations,
such as the Short-Time Fourier transform (STFT). Using the latest VFMs, such as
DINOv3 and SIGLIP-2, we achieve promising performance on other vital signs and
blood lab measurement tasks as well. Our proposal, Vision4PPG, unlocks a new
class of FMs to achieve SOTA performance with notable generalization to other
2D input representations, including STFT phase and recurrence plots. Our work
improves upon prior investigations of vision models for PPG by conducting a
comprehensive study, comparing them to state-of-the-art time-series FMs, and
demonstrating the general PPG processing ability by reporting results on six
additional tasks. Thus, we provide clinician-scientists with a new set of
powerful tools that is also computationally efficient, thanks to
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques.

Abstract: Pavement crack detection has long depended on costly and time-intensive
pixel-level annotations, which limit its scalability for large-scale
infrastructure monitoring. To overcome this barrier, this paper examines the
feasibility of achieving effective pixel-level crack segmentation entirely
without manual annotations. Building on this objective, a fully self-supervised
framework, Crack-Segmenter, is developed, integrating three complementary
modules: the Scale-Adaptive Embedder (SAE) for robust multi-scale feature
extraction, the Directional Attention Transformer (DAT) for maintaining linear
crack continuity, and the Attention-Guided Fusion (AGF) module for adaptive
feature integration. Through evaluations on ten public datasets,
Crack-Segmenter consistently outperforms 13 state-of-the-art supervised methods
across all major metrics, including mean Intersection over Union (mIoU), Dice
score, XOR, and Hausdorff Distance (HD). These findings demonstrate that
annotation-free crack detection is not only feasible but also superior,
enabling transportation agencies and infrastructure managers to conduct
scalable and cost-effective monitoring. This work advances self-supervised
learning and motivates pavement cracks detection research.

TL;DR: 该论文讨论了CNN在图像分类中存在的隐藏偏见问题，提出了两种方法来区分上下文信息和背景噪声，并在六个数据集上进行了验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CNN作为黑盒模型，其决策过程可能受到难以检测的背景信息偏见影响，需要开发方法来识别和区分这些偏见与有用的上下文信息。

Method: 提出了两种方法：1）将图像分割成非重叠的小块并随机打乱；2）应用傅里叶变换、小波变换和中值滤波等图像变换技术来恢复CNN用于分类的背景噪声信息。

Result: 实验结果表明，这些方法能够有效区分上下文信息和背景噪声，即使在没有背景信息的情况下也能检测到背景噪声的存在。

Conclusion: 提出的方法可以有效识别CNN中的隐藏偏见，帮助区分有用的上下文学习和有害的背景噪声，提高模型的可解释性和可靠性。

Abstract: CNNs are now prevalent as the primary choice for most machine vision problems
due to their superior rate of classification and the availability of
user-friendly libraries. These networks effortlessly identify and select
features in a non-intuitive data-driven manner, making it difficult to
determine which features were most influential. That leads to a ``black box",
where users cannot know how the image data are analyzed but rely on empirical
results. Therefore the decision-making process can be biased by background
information that is difficult to detect. Here we discuss examples of such
hidden biases and propose techniques for identifying them, methods to
distinguish between contextual information and background noise, and explore
whether CNNs learn from irrelevant features. One effective approach to identify
dataset bias is to classify blank background parts of the images. However, in
some situations a blank background in the images is not available, making it
more difficult to separate the foreground information from the blank
background. Such parts of the image can also be considered contextual learning,
not necessarily bias. To overcome this, we propose two approaches that were
tested on six different datasets, including natural, synthetic, and hybrid
datasets. The first method involves dividing images into smaller,
non-overlapping tiles of various sizes, which are then shuffled randomly,
making classification more challenging. The second method involves the
application of several image transforms, including Fourier, Wavelet transforms,
and Median filter, and their combinations. These transforms help recover
background noise information used by CNN to classify images. Results indicate
that this method can effectively distinguish between contextual information and
background noise, and alert on the presence of background noise even without
the need to use background information.

Conclusion: Mesh-Gait通过创新的3D热图中间表示，有效结合了2D和3D模态的优势，在保持计算效率的同时显著提升了步态识别性能。

Abstract: Gait recognition, a fundamental biometric technology, leverages unique
walking patterns for individual identification, typically using 2D
representations such as silhouettes or skeletons. However, these methods often
struggle with viewpoint variations, occlusions, and noise. Multi-modal
approaches that incorporate 3D body shape information offer improved robustness
but are computationally expensive, limiting their feasibility for real-time
applications. To address these challenges, we introduce Mesh-Gait, a novel
end-to-end multi-modal gait recognition framework that directly reconstructs 3D
representations from 2D silhouettes, effectively combining the strengths of
both modalities. Compared to existing methods, directly learning 3D features
from 3D joints or meshes is complex and difficult to fuse with silhouette-based
gait features. To overcome this, Mesh-Gait reconstructs 3D heatmaps as an
intermediate representation, enabling the model to effectively capture 3D
geometric information while maintaining simplicity and computational
efficiency. During training, the intermediate 3D heatmaps are gradually
reconstructed and become increasingly accurate under supervised learning, where
the loss is calculated between the reconstructed 3D joints, virtual markers,
and 3D meshes and their corresponding ground truth, ensuring precise spatial
alignment and consistent 3D structure. Mesh-Gait extracts discriminative
features from both silhouettes and reconstructed 3D heatmaps in a
computationally efficient manner. This design enables the model to capture
spatial and structural gait characteristics while avoiding the heavy overhead
of direct 3D reconstruction from RGB videos, allowing the network to focus on
motion dynamics rather than irrelevant visual details. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Mesh-Gait achieves state-of-the-art accuracy. The code will be
released upon acceptance of the paper.

Conclusion: 提出的结合特征空间顺序和渐进匹配的方法有效提升了图像特征匹配的性能，在效率和准确性方面均优于传统方法。

Abstract: Image feature matching plays a vital role in many computer vision tasks.
Although many image feature detection and matching techniques have been
proposed over the past few decades, it is still time-consuming to match feature
points in two images, especially for images with a large number of detected
features. Feature spatial order can estimate the probability that a pair of
features is correct. Since it is a completely independent concept from epipolar
geometry, it can be used to complement epipolar geometry in guiding feature
match in a target region so as to improve matching efficiency. In this paper,
we integrate the concept of feature spatial order into a progressive matching
framework. We use some of the initially matched features to build a
computational model of feature spatial order and employs it to calculates the
possible spatial range of subsequent feature matches, thus filtering out
unnecessary feature matches. We also integrate it with epipolar geometry to
further improve matching efficiency and accuracy. Since the spatial order of
feature points is affected by image rotation, we propose a suitable image
alignment method from the fundamental matrix of epipolar geometry to remove the
effect of image rotation. To verify the feasibility of the proposed method, we
conduct a series of experiments, including a standard benchmark dataset,
self-generated simulated images, and real images. The results demonstrate that
our proposed method is significantly more efficient and has more accurate
feature matching than the traditional method.

and skeletons) or 3D representations (e.g., meshes and SMPLs), but relying on a
single modality often fails to capture the full geometric and dynamic
complexity of human walking patterns. In this paper, we propose a multi-modal
and multi-task framework that combines 2D temporal silhouettes with 3D SMPL
features for robust gait analysis. Beyond identification, we introduce a
multitask learning strategy that jointly performs gait recognition and human
attribute estimation, including age, body mass index (BMI), and gender. A
unified transformer is employed to effectively fuse multi-modal gait features
and better learn attribute-related representations, while preserving
discriminative identity cues. Extensive experiments on the large-scale BRIAR
datasets, collected under challenging conditions such as long-range distances
(up to 1 km) and extreme pitch angles (up to 50{\deg}), demonstrate that our
approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in gait recognition and provides
accurate human attribute estimation. These results highlight the promise of
multi-modal and multitask learning for advancing gait-based human understanding
in real-world scenarios.

*Jyotirmay Nag Setu,Kevin Desai,John Quarles*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究使用迁移学习从VR游戏视频中提取视觉特征，结合LSTM网络预测网络晕动症严重程度，准确率达到68.4%，超越了仅使用视频数据的现有模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着VR技术的快速发展，网络晕动症（类似晕动症的症状）持续阻碍VR的广泛接受。虽然已有研究探索多模态深度学习方法，但基于视频特征预测网络晕动症的研究仍然有限。

Method: 使用在ImageNet数据集上预训练的InceptionV3模型通过迁移学习从VR游戏视频中提取高级视觉特征，然后将这些特征输入LSTM网络以捕捉VR体验的时间动态并预测网络晕动症严重程度。

Result: 该方法有效利用了视频数据的时间序列特性，在网络晕动症严重程度分类上达到了68.4%的准确率，超越了仅使用视频数据的现有模型性能。

Conclusion: 这项工作为VR开发者提供了一个实用的工具来评估和减轻虚拟环境中的网络晕动症，并为未来基于视频的时间建模研究以增强VR应用用户舒适度奠定了基础。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of virtual reality (VR) technology, its adoption
across domains such as healthcare, education, and entertainment has grown
significantly. However, the persistent issue of cybersickness, marked by
symptoms resembling motion sickness, continues to hinder widespread acceptance
of VR. While recent research has explored multimodal deep learning approaches
leveraging data from integrated VR sensors like eye and head tracking, there
remains limited investigation into the use of video-based features for
predicting cybersickness. In this study, we address this gap by utilizing
transfer learning to extract high-level visual features from VR gameplay videos
using the InceptionV3 model pretrained on the ImageNet dataset. These features
are then passed to a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to capture the
temporal dynamics of the VR experience and predict cybersickness severity over
time. Our approach effectively leverages the time-series nature of video data,
achieving a 68.4% classification accuracy for cybersickness severity. This
surpasses the performance of existing models trained solely on video data,
providing a practical tool for VR developers to evaluate and mitigate
cybersickness in virtual environments. Furthermore, this work lays the
foundation for future research on video-based temporal modeling for enhancing
user comfort in VR applications.

*Suyang Xi,Chenxi Yang,Hong Ding,Yiqing Ni,Catherine C. Liu,Yunhao Liu,Chengqi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了HuLiRAG框架，通过"what-where-reweight"级联方法改进多模态大语言模型在细粒度视觉问答中的表现，减少幻觉并提高事实一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在细粒度视觉问答中经常产生关于物体身份、位置和关系的幻觉，因为文本查询没有明确锚定到视觉参照物。现有的检索增强生成方法仅关注全局图像信息，缺乏局部细节和细粒度交互推理。

Method: HuLiRAG框架采用三阶段级联：1) 通过开放词汇检测将查询锚定到候选参照物(what)；2) 使用SAM衍生掩码进行空间解析以恢复细粒度精度(where)；3) 通过局部与全局对齐的权衡进行自适应优先级排序(reweight)。同时使用掩码引导微调将空间证据注入生成过程。

Result: 广泛实验表明，这种类人级联方法提高了接地保真度和事实一致性，同时减少了幻觉，推动了多模态问答向可信推理发展。

Conclusion: HuLiRAG框架通过模拟人类推理过程，将接地从被动偏置转变为对答案制定的显式约束，显著提升了多模态问答的可信度。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) often fail in fine-grained visual
question answering, producing hallucinations about object identities,
positions, and relations because textual queries are not explicitly anchored to
visual referents. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) alleviates some errors,
but it fails to align with human-like processing at both the retrieval and
augmentation levels. Specifically, it focuses only on global-level image
information but lacks local detail and limits reasoning about fine-grained
interactions. To overcome this limitation, we present Human-Like
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (HuLiRAG), a framework that stages multimodal
reasoning as a ``what--where--reweight'' cascade. Queries are first anchored to
candidate referents via open-vocabulary detection (what), then spatially
resolved with SAM-derived masks to recover fine-grained precision (where), and
adaptively prioritized through the trade-off between local and global alignment
(reweight). Mask-guided fine-tuning further injects spatial evidence into the
generation process, transforming grounding from a passive bias into an explicit
constraint on answer formulation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this
human-like cascade improves grounding fidelity and factual consistency while
reducing hallucinations, advancing multimodal question answering toward
trustworthy reasoning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MonoSE(3)-Diffusion是一个单目SE(3)扩散框架，通过条件去噪扩散过程进行无标记、基于图像的机器人姿态估计，在DREAM和RoboKeyGen基准测试中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前基于图像的机器人姿态估计方法中固定尺度扰动导致的训练姿态多样性不足和泛化能力有限的问题，提出通过扩散过程生成视场内多样化的训练姿态。

Method: 包含两个过程：1) 可见性约束扩散过程，将真实姿态逐步扰动为噪声变换用于训练姿态去噪网络；2) 时间步感知反向过程，通过从当前时间步的扩散后验采样来迭代预测和细化姿态估计。

Result: 在两个基准测试(DREAM和RoboKeyGen)上均取得改进，在最具挑战性的数据集上达到66.75的AUC，比现有最优方法提升32.3%。

Conclusion: 该扩散框架通过可见性约束和时间步感知细化方案，显著提高了姿态估计的准确性和鲁棒性，证明了扩散模型在机器人姿态估计任务中的有效性。

Abstract: We propose MonoSE(3)-Diffusion, a monocular SE(3) diffusion framework that
formulates markerless, image-based robot pose estimation as a conditional
denoising diffusion process. The framework consists of two processes: a
visibility-constrained diffusion process for diverse pose augmentation and a
timestep-aware reverse process for progressive pose refinement. The diffusion
process progressively perturbs ground-truth poses to noisy transformations for
training a pose denoising network. Importantly, we integrate visibility
constraints into the process, ensuring the transformations remain within the
camera field of view. Compared to the fixed-scale perturbations used in current
methods, the diffusion process generates in-view and diverse training poses,
thereby improving the network generalization capability. Furthermore, the
reverse process iteratively predicts the poses by the denoising network and
refines pose estimates by sampling from the diffusion posterior of current
timestep, following a scheduled coarse-to-fine procedure. Moreover, the
timestep indicates the transformation scales, which guide the denoising network
to achieve more accurate pose predictions. The reverse process demonstrates
higher robustness than direct prediction, benefiting from its timestep-aware
refinement scheme. Our approach demonstrates improvements across two benchmarks
(DREAM and RoboKeyGen), achieving a notable AUC of 66.75 on the most
challenging dataset, representing a 32.3% gain over the state-of-the-art.

TL;DR: 提出了CoDeGraph算法，通过检测和过滤一致异常来改进零样本图像异常分类和分割，解决了现有方法在处理重复出现的相似缺陷时的性能问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于表示的方法在处理一致异常（跨多个图像重复出现的相似缺陷）时表现不佳，导致异常分类和分割性能下降。

Method: 构建图像级图结构，将图像作为节点，通过共享的一致异常模式连接边，利用社区检测过滤异常。基于"邻居燃尽"现象识别一致异常。

Result: 在MVTec AD数据集上，使用ViT-L-14-336骨干网络达到98.3% AUROC的异常分类性能，分割F1分数66.8%（提升4.2%），AP 68.1%（提升5.4%）。使用DINOv2骨干网络进一步提升分割性能。

Conclusion: CoDeGraph算法能有效识别和过滤一致异常，在零样本异常检测任务中显著优于现有方法，且在不同骨干网络架构下都表现出鲁棒性。

Abstract: Zero-shot image anomaly classification (AC) and segmentation (AS) are vital
for industrial quality control, detecting defects without prior training data.
Existing representation-based methods compare patch features with nearest
neighbors in unlabeled test images but struggle with consistent anomalies --
similar defects recurring across multiple images -- resulting in poor AC/AS
performance. We introduce Consistent-Anomaly Detection Graph (CoDeGraph), a
novel algorithm that identifies and filters consistent anomalies from
similarity computations. Our key insight is that normal patches in industrial
images show stable, gradually increasing similarity to other test images, while
consistent-anomaly patches exhibit abrupt similarity spikes after exhausting a
limited set of similar matches, a phenomenon we term ``neighbor-burnout.''
CoDeGraph constructs an image-level graph, with images as nodes and edges
connecting those with shared consistent-anomaly patterns, using community
detection to filter these anomalies. We provide a theoretical foundation using
Extreme Value Theory to explain the effectiveness of our approach. Experiments
on MVTec AD with the ViT-L-14-336 backbone achieve 98.3% AUROC for AC and AS
performance of 66.8% (+4.2%) F1 and 68.1% (+5.4%) AP over state-of-the-art
zero-shot methods. Using the DINOv2 backbone further improves segmentation,
yielding 69.1% (+6.5%) F1 and 71.9% (+9.2%) AP, demonstrating robustness across
architectures.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的医学图像分割方法，通过模拟临床专家小组的决策过程来处理标注者间的差异，将专家分歧视为有用信号而非噪声。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割标注存在标注者间差异问题，传统方法简单平均专家标签会丢弃临床不确定性信息，需要更好地利用专家分歧中的价值。

Method: 开发了群体决策模拟框架，包括专家签名生成器学习个体标注者风格，以及模拟咨询模块从潜在空间智能采样生成最终分割结果。

Result: 在CBCT和MRI数据集上取得了最先进的结果，Dice分数分别达到92.11%和90.72%。

Conclusion: 通过将专家分歧视为有用信号而非噪声，为构建更鲁棒和可信的医疗AI系统提供了清晰路径。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation annotation suffers from inter-rater variability
(IRV) due to differences in annotators' expertise and the inherent blurriness
of medical images. Standard approaches that simply average expert labels are
flawed, as they discard the valuable clinical uncertainty revealed in
disagreements. We introduce a fundamentally new approach with our group
decision simulation framework, which works by mimicking the collaborative
decision-making process of a clinical panel. Under this framework, an Expert
Signature Generator (ESG) learns to represent individual annotator styles in a
unique latent space. A Simulated Consultation Module (SCM) then intelligently
generates the final segmentation by sampling from this space. This method
achieved state-of-the-art results on challenging CBCT and MRI datasets (92.11%
and 90.72% Dice scores). By treating expert disagreement as a useful signal
instead of noise, our work provides a clear path toward more robust and
trustworthy AI systems for healthcare.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了MultiTIPS数据集和新型多模态预后框架，通过双选项分割、多模态交互和多任务预测来解决TIPS术前预后建模的挑战，在生存率、门脉压力梯度和肝性脑病预测方面优于现有方法。

Motivation: TIPS手术预后结果差异大且常发生肝性脑病，需要准确的术前预后模型。现有方法面临ROI标注耗时、单模态方法可靠性差、单终点预测不完整等挑战，且缺乏公开数据集。

Method: 包含三个核心模块：(1)双选项分割：结合半监督和基础模型实现有限标注下的ROI分割；(2)多模态交互：使用多粒度放射组学注意力、渐进正交解缠和临床引导预后增强实现跨模态特征交互；(3)多任务预测：采用分阶段训练策略同时优化生存率、门脉压力梯度和肝性脑病预测。

Result: 在MultiTIPS数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法优于最先进方法，具有强大的跨域泛化能力和可解释性。

Conclusion: 该方法在临床应用中具有前景，数据集和代码已公开。

Abstract: Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) is an established
procedure for portal hypertension, but provides variable survival outcomes and
frequent overt hepatic encephalopathy (OHE), indicating the necessity of
accurate preoperative prognostic modeling. Current studies typically build
machine learning models from preoperative CT images or clinical
characteristics, but face three key challenges: (1) labor-intensive
region-of-interest (ROI) annotation, (2) poor reliability and generalizability
of unimodal methods, and (3) incomplete assessment from single-endpoint
prediction. Moreover, the lack of publicly accessible datasets constrains
research in this field. Therefore, we present MultiTIPS, the first public
multi-center dataset for TIPS prognosis, and propose a novel multimodal
prognostic framework based on it. The framework comprises three core modules:
(1) dual-option segmentation, which integrates semi-supervised and foundation
model-based pipelines to achieve robust ROI segmentation with limited
annotations and facilitate subsequent feature extraction; (2) multimodal
interaction, where three techniques, multi-grained radiomics attention (MGRA),
progressive orthogonal disentanglement (POD), and clinically guided prognostic
enhancement (CGPE), are introduced to enable cross-modal feature interaction
and complementary representation integration, thus improving model accuracy and
robustness; and (3) multi-task prediction, where a staged training strategy is
used to perform stable optimization of survival, portal pressure gradient
(PPG), and OHE prediction for comprehensive prognostic assessment. Extensive
experiments on MultiTIPS demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method
over state-of-the-art approaches, along with strong cross-domain generalization
and interpretability, indicating its promise for clinical application. The
dataset and code are available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Cross-Modal Guidance(CMG)方法，通过降解视觉-语言注意力来减少VLM中的幻觉问题，无需额外训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型存在严重幻觉问题，倾向于生成与图像无关但语言流畅的响应，主要原因是语言偏见。

Method: 通过自适应掩码最有影响力的图像token的注意力权重来降解视觉-语言感知，利用原始模型与降解后模型的输出分布差异进行解码。

Result: CMG显著减少了语言偏见而不损害VLM能力，在幻觉特定基准测试中提高了不同VLM的性能，并能有效泛化。

Conclusion: CMG是一种无需训练的解码方法，通过强调视觉上下文感知有效解决VLM幻觉问题，具有优越优势。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown solid ability for multimodal
understanding of both visual and language contexts. However, existing VLMs
often face severe challenges of hallucinations, meaning that VLMs tend to
generate responses that are only fluent in the language but irrelevant to
images in previous contexts. To address this issue, we analyze how language
bias contributes to hallucinations and then introduce Cross-Modal
Guidance(CMG), a training-free decoding method that addresses the
hallucinations by leveraging the difference between the output distributions of
the original model and the one with degraded visual-language attention. In
practice, we adaptively mask the attention weight of the most influential image
tokens in selected transformer layers to corrupt the visual-language perception
as a concrete type of degradation. Such a degradation-induced decoding
emphasizes the perception of visual contexts and therefore significantly
reduces language bias without harming the ability of VLMs. In experiment
sections, we conduct comprehensive studies. All results demonstrate the
superior advantages of CMG with neither additional conditions nor training
costs. We also quantitatively show CMG can improve different VLM's performance
on hallucination-specific benchmarks and generalize effectively.

<details>

Motivation: 现有伪图像表示方法在处理非结构化点云时，往往忽略点云的结构和语义细节，导致特征融合和判别性有限。

Method: 1) 全局-局部特征融合编码模块增强局部特征相关性；2) 多分支特征提取网络捕获邻域信息；3) 深度特征引导注意力机制提升跨通道特征融合精度。

Result: 在SemanticKITTI和nuScenes验证集上分别达到69.83%和78.65%的准确率，平衡了高性能与实时性。

Conclusion: DAGLFNet在基于LiDAR的实时应用中展现出巨大潜力，实现了效率与性能的良好平衡。

Abstract: Environmental perception systems play a critical role in high-precision
mapping and autonomous navigation, with LiDAR serving as a core sensor that
provides accurate 3D point cloud data. How to efficiently process unstructured
point clouds while extracting structured semantic information remains a
significant challenge, and in recent years, numerous pseudo-image-based
representation methods have emerged to achieve a balance between efficiency and
performance. However, they often overlook the structural and semantic details
of point clouds, resulting in limited feature fusion and discriminability. In
this work, we propose DAGLFNet, a pseudo-image-based semantic segmentation
framework designed to extract discriminative features. First, the Global-Local
Feature Fusion Encoding module is used to enhance the correlation among local
features within a set and capture global contextual information. Second, the
Multi-Branch Feature Extraction network is employed to capture more
neighborhood information and enhance the discriminability of contour features.
Finally, a Feature Fusion via Deep Feature-guided Attention mechanism is
introduced to improve the precision of cross-channel feature fusion.
Experimental evaluations show that DAGLFNet achieves 69.83\% and 78.65\% on the
validation sets of SemanticKITTI and nuScenes, respectively. The method
balances high performance with real-time capability, demonstrating great
potential for LiDAR-based real-time applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了MSF-Mamba和MSF-Mamba+模型，通过运动感知状态融合模块增强Mamba的局部时空建模能力，在微手势识别任务上实现了SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微手势识别需要同时建模长距离和局部时空依赖关系。CNN擅长局部模式但长距离依赖能力有限，Transformer能处理长距离依赖但计算成本高，而Mamba虽然效率高但缺乏局部时空建模能力。

Method: 提出运动感知状态融合Mamba模型，通过中心帧差分(CFD)的运动感知状态融合模块融合局部上下文相邻状态，增强局部时空建模。MSF-Mamba+版本支持多尺度运动感知状态融合和自适应尺度加权。

Result: 在两个公开微手势识别数据集上的实验表明，即使是轻量级版本MSF-Mamba也达到了SOTA性能，超越了现有的CNN、Transformer和SSM模型，同时保持高效率。

Conclusion: MSF-Mamba通过运动感知局部时空建模有效解决了原始Mamba的局限性，能够捕捉微手势识别中的细微运动线索，在性能和效率之间取得了良好平衡。

Abstract: Micro-gesture recognition (MGR) targets the identification of subtle and
fine-grained human motions and requires accurate modeling of both long-range
and local spatiotemporal dependencies. While CNNs are effective at capturing
local patterns, they struggle with long-range dependencies due to their limited
receptive fields. Transformer-based models address this limitation through
self-attention mechanisms but suffer from high computational costs. Recently,
Mamba has shown promise as an efficient model, leveraging state space models
(SSMs) to enable linear-time processing However, directly applying the vanilla
Mamba to MGR may not be optimal. This is because Mamba processes inputs as 1D
sequences, with state updates relying solely on the previous state, and thus
lacks the ability to model local spatiotemporal dependencies. In addition,
previous methods lack a design of motion-awareness, which is crucial in MGR. To
overcome these limitations, we propose motion-aware state fusion mamba
(MSF-Mamba), which enhances Mamba with local spatiotemporal modeling by fusing
local contextual neighboring states. Our design introduces a motion-aware state
fusion module based on central frame difference (CFD). Furthermore, a
multiscale version named MSF-Mamba+ has been proposed. Specifically, MSF-Mamba
supports multiscale motion-aware state fusion, as well as an adaptive scale
weighting module that dynamically weighs the fused states across different
scales. These enhancements explicitly address the limitations of vanilla Mamba
by enabling motion-aware local spatiotemporal modeling, allowing MSF-Mamba and
MSF-Mamba to effectively capture subtle motion cues for MGR. Experiments on two
public MGR datasets demonstrate that even the lightweight version, namely,
MSF-Mamba, achieves SoTA performance, outperforming existing CNN-,
Transformer-, and SSM-based models while maintaining high efficiency.

Conclusion: DKPMV证明了仅使用RGB图像就能实现高质量的6D姿态估计，为工业机器人应用提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: 6D pose estimation of textureless objects is valuable for industrial robotic
applications, yet remains challenging due to the frequent loss of depth
information. Current multi-view methods either rely on depth data or
insufficiently exploit multi-view geometric cues, limiting their performance.
In this paper, we propose DKPMV, a pipeline that achieves dense keypoint-level
fusion using only multi-view RGB images as input. We design a three-stage
progressive pose optimization strategy that leverages dense multi-view keypoint
geometry information. To enable effective dense keypoint fusion, we enhance the
keypoint network with attentional aggregation and symmetry-aware training,
improving prediction accuracy and resolving ambiguities on symmetric objects.
Extensive experiments on the ROBI dataset demonstrate that DKPMV outperforms
state-of-the-art multi-view RGB approaches and even surpasses the RGB-D methods
in the majority of cases. The code will be available soon.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) integrate visual knowledge with the analytical
capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) through supervised visual
instruction tuning, using image-question-answer triplets. However, the
potential of VLMs trained without supervised instruction remains largely
unexplored. This study validates that VLMs possess inherent self-refinement
capabilities, enabling them to generate high-quality supervised data without
external inputs and thereby learn autonomously. Specifically, to stimulate the
self-refinement ability of VLMs, we propose a self-refinement framework based
on a Triangular Consistency principle: within the image-query-answer triangle,
any masked elements should be consistently and accurately reconstructed. The
framework involves three steps: (1) We enable the instruction generation
ability of VLMs by adding multi-task instruction tuning like
image$\rightarrow$question-answer or image-answer$\rightarrow$question. (2) We
generate image-query-answer triplets from unlabeled images and use the
Triangular Consistency principle for filtering. (3) The model is further
updated using the filtered synthetic data. To investigate the underlying
mechanisms behind this self-refinement capability, we conduct a theoretical
analysis from a causal perspective. Using the widely recognized LLaVA-1.5 as
our baseline, our experiments reveal that the model can autonomously achieve
consistent, though deliberately modest, improvements across multiple benchmarks
without any external supervision, such as human annotations or environmental
feedback. We expect that the insights of this study on the self-refinement
ability of VLMs can inspire future research on the learning mechanism of VLMs.

Motivation: 标准RoPE在图像生成中存在显著局限性，包括细粒度空间关系建模不足、颜色线索缺失和物体计数困难，这源于其固定的频率分配、轴间独立性和统一的头处理方式。

Method: 提出HARoPE，在旋转映射前插入通过奇异值分解参数化的可学习线性变换，实现动态频率重分配、旋转平面语义对齐和头特定位置感受野，同时严格保持RoPE的相对位置属性。

Result: 在类条件ImageNet和文本到图像生成（Flux和MMDiT）上的广泛实验表明，HARoPE始终优于强RoPE基线和其他扩展方法。

Conclusion: HARoPE可作为有效的即插即用替代方案，为基于Transformer的图像生成模型提供了原则性和适应性强的位置感知增强解决方案。

Abstract: Transformers rely on explicit positional encoding to model structure in data.
While Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) excels in 1D domains, its application to
image generation reveals significant limitations such as fine-grained spatial
relation modeling, color cues, and object counting. This paper identifies key
limitations of standard multi-dimensional RoPE-rigid frequency allocation,
axis-wise independence, and uniform head treatment-in capturing the complex
structural biases required for fine-grained image generation. We propose
HARoPE, a head-wise adaptive extension that inserts a learnable linear
transformation parameterized via singular value decomposition (SVD) before the
rotary mapping. This lightweight modification enables dynamic frequency
reallocation, semantic alignment of rotary planes, and head-specific positional
receptive fields while rigorously preserving RoPE's relative-position property.
Extensive experiments on class-conditional ImageNet and text-to-image
generation (Flux and MMDiT) demonstrate that HARoPE consistently improves
performance over strong RoPE baselines and other extensions. The method serves
as an effective drop-in replacement, offering a principled and adaptable
solution for enhancing positional awareness in transformer-based image
generative models.

TL;DR: Jigsaw3D是一个基于多视角扩散的3D风格迁移方法，通过拼图操作分离风格与内容，实现快速、视角一致的3D资产风格化


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖直接参考风格注入或2D扩散模型，存在每场景优化成本高、风格与语义内容纠缠的问题

Method: 使用拼图操作（空间重排和随机掩码参考补丁）抑制对象语义并分离风格统计特征，通过参考到视角的交叉注意力将风格线索集成到多视角扩散模型中

Result: 在标准3D风格化基准测试中，Jigsaw3D实现了高风格保真度和多视角一致性，延迟显著降低，并能泛化到部分参考风格化、多对象场景风格化和可平铺纹理生成

Conclusion: Jigsaw3D提供了一种有效的3D风格迁移解决方案，通过风格与内容解耦实现了快速且视角一致的风格化效果

Abstract: Controllable 3D style transfer seeks to restyle a 3D asset so that its
textures match a reference image while preserving the integrity and multi-view
consistency. The prevalent methods either rely on direct reference style token
injection or score-distillation from 2D diffusion models, which incurs heavy
per-scene optimization and often entangles style with semantic content. We
introduce Jigsaw3D, a multi-view diffusion based pipeline that decouples style
from content and enables fast, view-consistent stylization. Our key idea is to
leverage the jigsaw operation - spatial shuffling and random masking of
reference patches - to suppress object semantics and isolate stylistic
statistics (color palettes, strokes, textures). We integrate these style cues
into a multi-view diffusion model via reference-to-view cross-attention,
producing view-consistent stylized renderings conditioned on the input mesh.
The renders are then style-baked onto the surface to yield seamless textures.
Across standard 3D stylization benchmarks, Jigsaw3D achieves high style
fidelity and multi-view consistency with substantially lower latency, and
generalizes to masked partial reference stylization, multi-object scene
styling, and tileable texture generation. Project page is available at:

TL;DR: VR-Thinker是一个思考式图像框架，通过视觉推理操作和可配置视觉记忆窗口，让奖励模型能够主动获取和更新视觉证据，解决了传统多模态奖励模型在处理长视频时的上下文限制和幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态奖励模型存在两个固有局限：(1)视觉输入消耗大量上下文预算，导致帧数减少和细节丢失；(2)所有视觉信息都打包到初始提示中，加剧了链式推理过程中的幻觉和遗忘问题。

Method: 提出VR-Thinker框架，包含视觉推理操作和可配置视觉记忆窗口。采用强化微调流程：(i)冷启动使用策划的视觉链式思维数据；(ii)选择所有维度判断正确的样本进行拒绝采样微调；(iii)应用组相对策略优化来强化推理。

Result: 在视频偏好基准测试中达到最先进精度：7B VR-Thinker在VideoGen Reward上达到80.5%，GenAI-Bench上82.3%，MJ-Bench-Video上75.6%，特别在长视频上表现优异。

Conclusion: 结果验证了思考式图像多模态奖励建模的有效性和前景，为处理长视频内容提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal reward models (RMs) have substantially
improved post-training for visual generative models. However, current RMs face
inherent limitations: (1) visual inputs consume large context budgets, forcing
fewer frames and causing loss of fine-grained details; and (2) all visual
information is packed into the initial prompt, exacerbating hallucination and
forgetting during chain-of-thought reasoning. To overcome these issues, we
introduce VideoReward Thinker (VR-Thinker), a thinking-with-image framework
that equips the RM with visual reasoning operations (e.g., select frame) and a
configurable visual memory window. This allows the RM to actively acquire and
update visual evidence within context limits, improving reasoning fidelity and
reliability. We activate visual reasoning via a reinforcement fine-tuning
pipeline: (i) Cold Start with curated visual chain-of-thought data to distill
basic reasoning skills and operation formatting; (ii) select samples whose
per-dimension and overall judgments are all correct, then conduct Rejection
sampling Fine-Tuning on these high-quality traces to further enhance reasoning;
and (iii) apply Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to strengthen
reasoning. Our approach delivers state-of-the-art accuracy among open-source
models on video preference benchmarks, especially for longer videos: a 7B
VR-Thinker achieves 80.5% on VideoGen Reward, 82.3% on GenAI-Bench, and 75.6%
on MJ-Bench-Video. These results validate the effectiveness and promise of
thinking-with-image multimodal reward modeling.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的LUT方法，通过自适应量化、不规则扩张卷积和U型级联结构来扩展CNN感受野，在固定表格大小下提升推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LUT方法由于表格大小组合爆炸问题，导致卷积核感受野受限，限制了CNN推理性能。

Method: 学习最优格点向量量化器自适应分配量化分辨率；使用不规则扩张卷积；构建U型级联LUT结构捕获多级上下文信息。

Result: 在保持相同空间复杂度的情况下，显著提升了LUT驱动的快速CNN推理性能。

Conclusion: 该方法有效平衡了速度、精度和内存效率，相比现有LUT方法有显著改进。

Abstract: Recently, several look-up table (LUT) methods were developed to greatly
expedite the inference of CNNs in a classical strategy of trading space for
speed. However, these LUT methods suffer from a common drawback of limited
receptive field of the convolution kernels due to the combinatorial explosion
of table size. This research aims to expand the CNN receptive field with a
fixed table size, thereby enhancing the performance of LUT-driven fast CNN
inference while maintaining the same space complexity. To achieve this goal,
various techniques are proposed. The main contribution is a novel approach of
learning an optimal lattice vector quantizer that adaptively allocates the
quantization resolution across data dimensions based on their significance to
the inference task. In addition, the lattice vector quantizer offers an
inherently more accurate approximation of CNN kernels than scalar quantizer as
used in current practice. Furthermore, we introduce other receptive field
expansion strategies, including irregular dilated convolutions and a U-shaped
cascaded LUT structure, designed to capture multi-level contextual information
without inflating table size. Together, these innovations allow our approach to
effectively balance speed, accuracy, and memory efficiency, demonstrating
significant improvements over existing LUT methods.

Motivation: 解决以往开放词汇分割和上下文分割方法在架构差异、学习目标和表示学习策略上的不一致性问题，实现统一的多模态分割框架。

Method: 利用基础模型提取输入图像和多模态提示的表示，通过SegDecoder对齐这些表示并建模它们之间的交互，生成不同粒度的掩码。

Result: 综合实验表明COSINE在开放词汇分割和上下文分割任务上都有显著性能提升，视觉和文本提示的协同使用比单模态方法有更好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: COSINE成功统一了开放词汇分割和上下文分割，通过多模态提示的协同作用实现了更好的分割性能，为开世界分割提供了有效的统一解决方案。

Abstract: In this work, we present COSINE, a unified open-world segmentation model that
consolidates open-vocabulary segmentation and in-context segmentation with
multi-modal prompts (e.g., text and image). COSINE exploits foundation models
to extract representations for an input image and corresponding multi-modal
prompts, and a SegDecoder to align these representations, model their
interaction, and obtain masks specified by input prompts across different
granularities. In this way, COSINE overcomes architectural discrepancies,
divergent learning objectives, and distinct representation learning strategies
of previous pipelines for open-vocabulary segmentation and in-context
segmentation. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that COSINE has significant
performance improvements in both open-vocabulary and in-context segmentation
tasks. Our exploratory analyses highlight that the synergistic collaboration
between using visual and textual prompts leads to significantly improved
generalization over single-modality approaches.

Abstract: This work presents a pattern-aware framework for automatic license plate
recognition (ALPR), designed to operate reliably across diverse plate layouts
and challenging real-world conditions. The proposed system consists of a
modern, high-precision detection network followed by a recognition stage that
integrates a transformer-based vision model with an iterative language
modelling mechanism. This unified recognition stage performs character
identification and post-OCR refinement in a seamless process, learning the
structural patterns and formatting rules specific to license plates without
relying on explicit heuristic corrections or manual layout classification.
Through this design, the system jointly optimizes visual and linguistic cues,
enables iterative refinement to improve OCR accuracy under noise, distortion,
and unconventional fonts, and achieves layout-independent recognition across
multiple international datasets (IR-LPR, UFPR-ALPR, AOLP). Experimental results
demonstrate superior accuracy and robustness compared to recent
segmentation-free approaches, highlighting how embedding pattern analysis
within the recognition stage bridges computer vision and language modelling for
enhanced adaptability in intelligent transportation and surveillance
applications.

TL;DR: 提出Modality Capability Enhancement (MCE)方法解决多模态学习中缺失模态的挑战，特别是在不平衡缺失率下。MCE包含学习能力增强和表示能力增强两个组件，在四个多模态基准测试中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态学习面临缺失模态的挑战，特别是在不平衡缺失率下会形成恶性循环：缺失率高的模态更新次数少，导致学习进度不一致和表示质量下降。现有方法主要关注数据集级平衡，忽略了样本级模态效用变化和特征质量下降问题。

Method: MCE包含两个协同组件：1) 学习能力增强(LCE)，通过多级因子动态平衡模态特定学习进度；2) 表示能力增强(RCE)，通过子集预测和跨模态补全任务提升特征语义和鲁棒性。

Result: 在四个多模态基准测试上的综合评估表明，MCE在各种缺失配置下始终优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: MCE有效解决了多模态学习中缺失模态的挑战，特别是在不平衡缺失率情况下，通过平衡学习进度和提升特征质量实现了更好的性能。

Abstract: Multi-modal learning has made significant advances across diverse pattern
recognition applications. However, handling missing modalities, especially
under imbalanced missing rates, remains a major challenge. This imbalance
triggers a vicious cycle: modalities with higher missing rates receive fewer
updates, leading to inconsistent learning progress and representational
degradation that further diminishes their contribution. Existing methods
typically focus on global dataset-level balancing, often overlooking critical
sample-level variations in modality utility and the underlying issue of
degraded feature quality. We propose Modality Capability Enhancement (MCE) to
tackle these limitations. MCE includes two synergistic components: i) Learning
Capability Enhancement (LCE), which introduces multi-level factors to
dynamically balance modality-specific learning progress, and ii) Representation
Capability Enhancement (RCE), which improves feature semantics and robustness
through subset prediction and cross-modal completion tasks. Comprehensive
evaluations on four multi-modal benchmarks show that MCE consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art methods under various missing configurations. The

Motivation: 冰川湖溃决洪水是高山地区罕见但破坏性强的灾害，现有研究受限于碎片化和单模态数据，缺乏用于预测的统一数据集。

Method: 整合三种互补数据源：Sentinel-2多光谱影像用于空间监测，NASA ITS_LIVE速度产品用于冰川运动学，MODIS地表温度记录覆盖二十多年。预处理包括云掩膜、质量过滤、归一化、时间插值、数据增强和循环编码，然后进行多模态数据协调。

Conclusion: 通过解决类别不平衡、云污染和粗分辨率等挑战，GLOFNet为罕见灾害预测的多模态深度学习方法提供了结构化基准测试基础。

Abstract: Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOFs) are rare but destructive hazards in high
mountain regions, yet predictive research is hindered by fragmented and
unimodal data. Most prior efforts emphasize post-event mapping, whereas
forecasting requires harmonized datasets that combine visual indicators with
physical precursors. We present GLOFNet, a multimodal dataset for GLOF
monitoring and prediction, focused on the Shisper Glacier in the Karakoram. It
integrates three complementary sources: Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery for
spatial monitoring, NASA ITS_LIVE velocity products for glacier kinematics, and
MODIS Land Surface Temperature records spanning over two decades. Preprocessing
included cloud masking, quality filtering, normalization, temporal
interpolation, augmentation, and cyclical encoding, followed by harmonization
across modalities. Exploratory analysis reveals seasonal glacier velocity
cycles, long-term warming of ~0.8 K per decade, and spatial heterogeneity in
cryospheric conditions. The resulting dataset, GLOFNet, is publicly available
to support future research in glacial hazard prediction. By addressing
challenges such as class imbalance, cloud contamination, and coarse resolution,
GLOFNet provides a structured foundation for benchmarking multimodal deep
learning approaches to rare hazard prediction.

Abstract: Aiming at the problems of missed detection, false detection and low detection
efficiency in transmission line foreign object detection under railway
environment, we proposed an improved algorithm MRS-YOLO based on YOLO11.
Firstly, a multi-scale Adaptive Kernel Depth Feature Fusion (MAKDF) module is
proposed and fused with the C3k2 module to form C3k2_MAKDF, which enhances the
model's feature extraction capability for foreign objects of different sizes
and shapes. Secondly, a novel Re-calibration Feature Fusion Pyramid Network
(RCFPN) is designed as a neck structure to enhance the model's ability to
integrate and utilize multi-level features effectively. Then, Spatial and
Channel Reconstruction Detect Head (SC_Detect) based on spatial and channel
preprocessing is designed to enhance the model's overall detection performance.
Finally, the channel pruning technique is used to reduce the redundancy of the
improved model, drastically reduce Parameters and Giga Floating Point

that the improved algorithm can be better applied to the task of foreign object
detection in railroad transmission lines.

Abstract: Weed species classification represents an important step for the development
of automated targeting systems that allow the adoption of precision agriculture
practices. To reduce costs and yield losses caused by their presence. The
identification of weeds is a challenging problem due to their shared
similarities with crop plants and the variability related to the differences in
terms of their types. Along with the variations in relation to changes in field
conditions. Moreover, to fully benefit from deep learning-based methods, large
fully annotated datasets are needed. This requires time intensive and laborious
process for data labeling, which represents a limitation in agricultural
applications. Hence, for the aim of improving the utilization of the unlabeled
data, regarding conditions of scarcity in terms of the labeled data available
during the learning phase and provide robust and high classification
performance. We propose a deep semi-supervised approach, that combines
consistency regularization with similarity learning. Through our developed deep

Conclusion: UniFlow通过语义特征作为视觉条件有效缓解理解与生成之间的训练冲突，实现了统一建模的双赢结果。

Abstract: Tokenizer is a crucial component for both visual understanding and
generation. To advance toward the ultimate goal of universal modeling, recent
research has focused on developing a unified tokenizer. However, existing
tokenizers face a significant performance trade-off between understanding and
generation, stemming from the inherent conflict between high-level semantic
abstraction and low-level pixel reconstruction. To tackle this challenge, we
propose a generic and unified tokenizer, namely UniFlow, by flexibly adapting
any visual encoder with a concise reconstruction decoder. Specifically, we
introduce layer-wise adaptive self-distillation applied to the well-pretrained
visual encoders, which enables UniFlow to simultaneously inherit the strong
semantic features for visual understanding and flexibly adapt to model
fine-grained details for visual generation. Moreover, we propose a lightweight
patch-wise pixel flow decoder, which efficiently achieves high-fidelity pixel
reconstruction by modeling a conditional flow from the noisy state back to the
patch-wise pixel domain. By leveraging the semantic features as visual
conditions for the decoder, we effectively alleviate the training conflicts
between understanding and generation. Furthermore, the patch-wise learning
strategy simplifies the data distribution, thereby improving training
efficiency. Extensive experiments across 13 challenging benchmarks spanning 7
widely studied visual understanding and generation tasks demonstrate that
UniFlow achieves a win-win outcome. For instance, our 7B UniFlow-XL not only
surpasses the 14B TokenFlow-XL by 7.75% on average understanding benchmarks,
but also achieves competitive results in both visual reconstruction and
generation, surpassing UniTok by 0.15 in rFID and 0.09 in gFID (without
guidance), respectively.

Conclusion: 基于扩散模型的外观-边界融合方法能够有效解决高速和低光场景下的光流估计挑战，为退化场景下的运动分析提供了新思路。

Abstract: Optical flow estimation has achieved promising results in conventional scenes
but faces challenges in high-speed and low-light scenes, which suffer from
motion blur and insufficient illumination. These conditions lead to weakened
texture and amplified noise and deteriorate the appearance saturation and
boundary completeness of frame cameras, which are necessary for motion feature
matching. In degraded scenes, the frame camera provides dense appearance
saturation but sparse boundary completeness due to its long imaging time and
low dynamic range. In contrast, the event camera offers sparse appearance
saturation, while its short imaging time and high dynamic range gives rise to
dense boundary completeness. Traditionally, existing methods utilize feature
fusion or domain adaptation to introduce event to improve boundary
completeness. However, the appearance features are still deteriorated, which
severely affects the mostly adopted discriminative models that learn the
mapping from visual features to motion fields and generative models that
generate motion fields based on given visual features. So we introduce
diffusion models that learn the mapping from noising flow to clear flow, which
is not affected by the deteriorated visual features. Therefore, we propose a
novel optical flow estimation framework Diff-ABFlow based on diffusion models
with frame-event appearance-boundary fusion.

Motivation: 预训练视觉基础模型在计算机视觉任务中表现出色，但其在OOD检测任务中的潜力尚未充分探索。本文旨在系统研究这些模型在OOD检测中的应用价值。

Abstract: Pre-trained vision foundation models have transformed many computer vision
tasks. Despite their strong ability to learn discriminative and generalizable
features crucial for out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, their impact on this
task remains underexplored. Motivated by this gap, we systematically
investigate representative vision foundation models for OOD detection. Our
findings reveal that a pre-trained DINOv2 model, even without fine-tuning on
in-domain (ID) data, naturally provides a highly discriminative feature space
for OOD detection, achieving performance comparable to existing
state-of-the-art methods without requiring complex designs. Beyond this, we
explore how fine-tuning foundation models on in-domain (ID) data can enhance
OOD detection. However, we observe that the performance of vision foundation
models remains unsatisfactory in scenarios with a large semantic space. This is
due to the increased complexity of decision boundaries as the number of
categories grows, which complicates the optimization process. To mitigate this,
we propose the Mixture of Feature Experts (MoFE) module, which partitions
features into subspaces, effectively capturing complex data distributions and
refining decision boundaries. Further, we introduce a Dynamic-$\beta$ Mixup
strategy, which samples interpolation weights from a dynamic beta distribution.
This adapts to varying levels of learning difficulty across categories,
improving feature learning for more challenging categories. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, significantly
outperforming baseline methods.

Abstract: Visual grounding aims to predict the locations of target objects specified by
textual descriptions. For this task with linguistic and visual modalities,
there is a latest research line that focuses on only selecting the
linguistic-relevant visual regions for object localization to reduce the
computational overhead. Albeit achieving impressive performance, it is
iteratively performed on different image scales, and at every iteration,
linguistic features and visual features need to be stored in a cache, incurring
extra overhead. To facilitate the implementation, in this paper, we propose a
feature selection-based simple yet effective baseline for visual grounding,
called FSVG. Specifically, we directly encapsulate the linguistic and visual
modalities into an overall network architecture without complicated iterative
procedures, and utilize the language in parallel as guidance to facilitate the
interaction between linguistic modal and visual modal for extracting effective
visual features. Furthermore, to reduce the computational cost, during the
visual feature learning, we introduce a similarity-based feature selection
mechanism to only exploit language-related visual features for faster
prediction. Extensive experiments conducted on several benchmark datasets
comprehensively substantiate that the proposed FSVG achieves a better balance
between accuracy and efficiency beyond the current state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: ViSurf是一种统一的后训练范式，将监督微调(SFT)和基于可验证奖励的强化学习(RLVR)的优势整合在单阶段训练中，通过向RLVR轨迹注入真实标签来同时提供外部监督和内部强化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统后训练方法存在局限性：SFT通常导致次优性能，而RLVR在处理超出模型内部知识库的任务时表现不佳。需要一种能结合两者优势的统一方法。

Method: 提出ViSurf范式，分析推导SFT和RLVR目标以建立统一目标。核心方法是在RLVR轨迹中注入真实标签，同时提供外部监督和内部强化，并引入三种新的奖励控制策略来稳定优化训练过程。

Result: 在多个多样化基准测试中的广泛实验表明，ViSurf优于单独的SFT、RLVR以及两阶段的SFT→RLVR方法。深入分析验证了ViSurf的推导和设计原则。

Conclusion: ViSurf通过统一SFT和RLVR范式，有效解决了传统方法的局限性，在提升大型视觉语言模型性能方面表现出显著优势。

Abstract: Typical post-training paradigms for Large Vision-and-Language Models (LVLMs)
include Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable
Rewards (RLVR). SFT leverages external guidance to inject new knowledge,
whereas RLVR utilizes internal reinforcement to enhance reasoning capabilities
and overall performance. However, our analysis reveals that SFT often leads to
sub-optimal performance, while RLVR struggles with tasks that exceed the
model's internal knowledge base. To address these limitations, we propose
ViSurf (\textbf{Vi}sual \textbf{Su}pervised-and-\textbf{R}einforcement
\textbf{F}ine-Tuning), a unified post-training paradigm that integrates the
strengths of both SFT and RLVR within a single stage. We analyze the derivation
of the SFT and RLVR objectives to establish the ViSurf objective, providing a
unified perspective on these two paradigms. The core of ViSurf involves
injecting ground-truth labels into the RLVR rollouts, thereby providing
simultaneous external supervision and internal reinforcement. Furthermore, we
introduce three novel reward control strategies to stabilize and optimize the
training process. Extensive experiments across several diverse benchmarks
demonstrate the effectiveness of ViSurf, outperforming both individual SFT,
RLVR, and two-stage SFT \textrightarrow RLVR. In-depth analysis corroborates
these findings, validating the derivation and design principles of ViSurf.

TL;DR: OmniQuality-R是一个统一奖励建模框架，将多任务质量推理转化为连续可解释的奖励信号，用于策略优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉评估方法通常局限于单一任务，需要解决多任务质量评估的统一框架问题。

Method: 通过拒绝采样构建推理增强的奖励建模数据集，使用Group Relative Policy Optimization进行后训练，结合标准差过滤和熵门控机制稳定训练。

Result: 在三个关键图像质量评估任务上进行评估：美学质量评估、技术质量评估和图文对齐。

Conclusion: 该框架能够将多维度推理转化为连续可解释的奖励信号，支持多任务视觉质量评估。

Abstract: Current visual evaluation approaches are typically constrained to a single
task. To address this, we propose OmniQuality-R, a unified reward modeling
framework that transforms multi-task quality reasoning into continuous and
interpretable reward signals for policy optimization. Inspired by subjective
experiments, where participants are given task-specific instructions outlining
distinct assessment principles prior to evaluation, we propose OmniQuality-R, a
structured reward modeling framework that transforms multi-dimensional
reasoning into continuous and interpretable reward signals. To enable this, we
construct a reasoning-enhanced reward modeling dataset by sampling informative
plan-reason trajectories via rejection sampling, forming a reliable
chain-of-thought (CoT) dataset for supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Building on
this, we apply Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) for post-training,
using a Gaussian-based reward to support continuous score prediction. To
further stabilize the training and improve downstream generalization, we
incorporate standard deviation (STD) filtering and entropy gating mechanisms
during reinforcement learning. These techniques suppress unstable updates and
reduce variance in policy optimization. We evaluate OmniQuality-R on three key
IQA tasks: aesthetic quality assessment, technical quality evaluation, and
text-image alignment.

Conclusion: 所提出的混合框架有效解决了线性注意力的表达限制问题，在保持计算效率的同时显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Linear attention mechanisms have emerged as efficient alternatives to full
self-attention in Graph Transformers, offering linear time complexity. However,
existing linear attention models often suffer from a significant drop in
expressiveness due to low-rank projection structures and overly uniform
attention distributions. We theoretically prove that these properties reduce
the class separability of node representations, limiting the model's
classification ability. To address this, we propose a novel hybrid framework
that enhances both the rank and focus of attention. Specifically, we enhance
linear attention by attaching a gated local graph network branch to the value
matrix, thereby increasing the rank of the resulting attention map.
Furthermore, to alleviate the excessive smoothing effect inherent in linear
attention, we introduce a learnable log-power function into the attention
scores to reduce entropy and sharpen focus. We theoretically show that this
function decreases entropy in the attention distribution, enhancing the
separability of learned embeddings. Extensive experiments on both homophilic
and heterophilic graph benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves
competitive performance while preserving the scalability of linear attention.

Abstract: Audio-driven talking-head generation has advanced rapidly with
diffusion-based generative models, yet producing temporally coherent videos
with fine-grained motion control remains challenging. We propose DEMO, a
flow-matching generative framework for audio-driven talking-portrait video
synthesis that delivers disentangled, high-fidelity control of lip motion, head
pose, and eye gaze. The core contribution is a motion auto-encoder that builds
a structured latent space in which motion factors are independently represented
and approximately orthogonalized. On this disentangled motion space, we apply
optimal-transport-based flow matching with a transformer predictor to generate
temporally smooth motion trajectories conditioned on audio. Extensive
experiments across multiple benchmarks show that DEMO outperforms prior methods
in video realism, lip-audio synchronization, and motion fidelity. These results
demonstrate that combining fine-grained motion disentanglement with flow-based
generative modeling provides a powerful new paradigm for controllable
talking-head video synthesis.

Abstract: For high-stakes applications, like autonomous driving, a safe operation is
necessary to prevent harm, accidents, and failures. Traditionally, difficult
scenarios have been categorized into corner cases and addressed individually.
However, this example-based categorization is not scalable and lacks a data
coverage perspective, neglecting the generalization to training data of machine
learning models. In our work, we propose a novel machine learning approach that
takes the underlying data distribution into account. Based on our novel
perspective, we present a framework for effective corner case recognition for
perception on individual samples. In our evaluation, we show that our approach
(i) unifies existing scenario-based corner case taxonomies under a
distributional perspective, (ii) achieves strong performance on corner case
detection tasks across standard benchmarks for which we extend established
out-of-distribution detection benchmarks, and (iii) enables analysis of
combined corner cases via a newly introduced fog-augmented Lost & Found
dataset. These results provide a principled basis for corner case recognition,
underlining our manual specification-free definition.

Abstract: As one of the fundamental modules in autonomous driving, online
high-definition (HD) maps have attracted significant attention due to their
cost-effectiveness and real-time capabilities. Since vehicles always cruise in
highly dynamic environments, spatial displacement of onboard sensors inevitably
causes shifts in real-time HD mapping results, and such instability poses
fundamental challenges for downstream tasks. However, existing online map
construction models tend to prioritize improving each frame's mapping accuracy,
while the mapping stability has not yet been systematically studied. To fill
this gap, this paper presents the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating
the temporal stability of online HD mapping models. We propose a
multi-dimensional stability evaluation framework with novel metrics for
Presence, Localization, and Shape Stability, integrated into a unified mean
Average Stability (mAS) score. Extensive experiments on 42 models and variants
show that accuracy (mAP) and stability (mAS) represent largely independent
performance dimensions. We further analyze the impact of key model design
choices on both criteria, identifying architectural and training factors that
contribute to high accuracy, high stability, or both. To encourage broader
focus on stability, we will release a public benchmark. Our work highlights the
importance of treating temporal stability as a core evaluation criterion
alongside accuracy, advancing the development of more reliable autonomous
driving systems. The benchmark toolkit, code, and models will be available at
https://stablehdmap.github.io/.

Conclusion: FS-VFM是一个可扩展的自监督预训练框架，能够学习真实人脸的基础表示，在各种人脸安全任务中实现优异的泛化性能

Abstract: With abundant, unlabeled real faces, how can we learn robust and transferable
facial representations to boost generalization across various face security
tasks? We make the first attempt and propose FS-VFM, a scalable self-supervised
pre-training framework, to learn fundamental representations of real face
images. We introduce three learning objectives, namely 3C, that synergize
masked image modeling (MIM) and instance discrimination (ID), empowering FS-VFM
to encode both local patterns and global semantics of real faces. Specifically,
we formulate various facial masking strategies for MIM and devise a simple yet
effective CRFR-P masking, which explicitly prompts the model to pursue
meaningful intra-region Consistency and challenging inter-region Coherency. We
present a reliable self-distillation mechanism that seamlessly couples MIM with
ID to establish underlying local-to-global Correspondence. After pre-training,
vanilla vision transformers (ViTs) serve as universal Vision Foundation Models
for downstream Face Security tasks: cross-dataset deepfake detection,
cross-domain face anti-spoofing, and unseen diffusion facial forensics. To
efficiently transfer the pre-trained FS-VFM, we further propose FS-Adapter, a
lightweight plug-and-play bottleneck atop the frozen backbone with a novel
real-anchor contrastive objective. Extensive experiments on 11 public
benchmarks demonstrate that our FS-VFM consistently generalizes better than
diverse VFMs, spanning natural and facial domains, fully, weakly, and
self-supervised paradigms, small, base, and large ViT scales, and even
outperforms SOTA task-specific methods, while FS-Adapter offers an excellent
efficiency-performance trade-off. The code and models are available on

Abstract: Recent Text-to-Video (T2V) models have demonstrated powerful capability in
visual simulation of real-world geometry and physical laws, indicating its
potential as implicit world models. Inspired by this, we explore the
feasibility of leveraging the video generation prior for viewpoint planning
from given 4D scenes, since videos internally accompany dynamic scenes with
natural viewpoints. To this end, we propose a two-stage paradigm to adapt
pre-trained T2V models for viewpoint prediction, in a compatible manner. First,
we inject the 4D scene representation into the pre-trained T2V model via an
adaptive learning branch, where the 4D scene is viewpoint-agnostic and the
conditional generated video embeds the viewpoints visually. Then, we formulate
viewpoint extraction as a hybrid-condition guided camera extrinsic denoising
process. Specifically, a camera extrinsic diffusion branch is further
introduced onto the pre-trained T2V model, by taking the generated video and 4D
scene as input. Experimental results show the superiority of our proposed
method over existing competitors, and ablation studies validate the
effectiveness of our key technical designs. To some extent, this work proves
the potential of video generation models toward 4D interaction in real world.

Abstract: Image-Language Foundation Models (ILFM) have demonstrated remarkable success
in image-text understanding/generation tasks, providing transferable multimodal
representations that generalize across diverse downstream image-based tasks.
The advancement of video-text research has spurred growing interest in
extending image-based models to the video domain. This paradigm, known as
image-to-video transfer learning, succeeds in alleviating the substantial data
and computational requirements associated with training video-language
foundation models from scratch for video-text learning. This survey provides
the first comprehensive review of this emerging field, which begins by
summarizing the widely used ILFM and their capabilities. We then systematically
classify existing image-to-video transfer learning strategies into two
categories: frozen features and modified features, depending on whether the
original representations from ILFM are preserved or undergo modifications.
Building upon the task-specific nature of image-to-video transfer, this survey
methodically elaborates these strategies and details their applications across
a spectrum of video-text learning tasks, ranging from fine-grained (e.g.,
spatio-temporal video grounding) to coarse-grained (e.g., video question
answering). We further present a detailed experimental analysis to investigate
the efficacy of different image-to-video transfer learning paradigms on a range
of downstream video understanding tasks. Finally, we identify prevailing
challenges and highlight promising directions for future research. By offering
a comprehensive and structured overview, this survey aims to establish a
structured roadmap for advancing video-text learning based on existing ILFM,
and to inspire future research directions in this rapidly evolving domain.

Abstract: Multi-modal brain tumor segmentation is critical for clinical diagnosis, and
it requires accurate identification of distinct internal anatomical subregions.
While the recent prompt-based segmentation paradigms enable interactive
experiences for clinicians, existing methods ignore cross-modal correlations
and rely on labor-intensive category-specific prompts, limiting their
applicability in real-world scenarios. To address these issues, we propose a
MSM-Seg framework for multi-modal brain tumor segmentation. The MSM-Seg
introduces a novel dual-memory segmentation paradigm that synergistically
integrates multi-modal and inter-slice information with the efficient
category-agnostic prompt for brain tumor understanding. To this end, we first
devise a modality-and-slice memory attention (MSMA) to exploit the cross-modal
and inter-slice relationships among the input scans. Then, we propose a
multi-scale category-agnostic prompt encoder (MCP-Encoder) to provide tumor
region guidance for decoding. Moreover, we devise a modality-adaptive fusion
decoder (MF-Decoder) that leverages the complementary decoding information
across different modalities to improve segmentation accuracy. Extensive
experiments on different MRI datasets demonstrate that our MSM-Seg framework
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in multi-modal metastases and glioma tumor
segmentation. The code is available at https://github.com/xq141839/MSM-Seg.

Abstract: Action understanding, encompassing action detection and anticipation, plays a
crucial role in numerous practical applications. However, untrimmed videos are
often characterized by substantial redundant information and noise. Moreover,
in modeling action understanding, the influence of the agent's intention on the
action is often overlooked. Motivated by these issues, we propose a novel
framework called the State-Specific Model (SSM), designed to unify and enhance
both action detection and anticipation tasks. In the proposed framework, the
Critical State-Based Memory Compression module compresses frame sequences into
critical states, reducing information redundancy. The Action Pattern Learning
module constructs a state-transition graph with multi-dimensional edges to
model action dynamics in complex scenarios, on the basis of which potential
future cues can be generated to represent intention. Furthermore, our
Cross-Temporal Interaction module models the mutual influence between
intentions and past as well as current information through cross-temporal
interactions, thereby refining present and future features and ultimately
realizing simultaneous action detection and anticipation. Extensive experiments
on multiple benchmark datasets -- including EPIC-Kitchens-100, THUMOS'14,
TVSeries, and the introduced Parkinson's Disease Mouse Behaviour (PDMB) dataset
-- demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed framework compared to
other state-of-the-art approaches. These results highlight the importance of
action dynamics learning and cross-temporal interactions, laying a foundation
for future action understanding research.

Conclusion: 提出的统一框架能够有效处理单目视频中的散焦模糊和运动模糊，生成高质量动态高斯溅射结果

Abstract: This paper presents a unified framework that allows high-quality dynamic
Gaussian Splatting from both defocused and motion-blurred monocular videos. Due
to the significant difference between the formation processes of defocus blur
and motion blur, existing methods are tailored for either one of them, lacking
the ability to simultaneously deal with both of them. Although the two can be
jointly modeled as blur kernel-based convolution, the inherent difficulty in
estimating accurate blur kernels greatly limits the progress in this direction.
In this work, we go a step further towards this direction. Particularly, we
propose to estimate per-pixel reliable blur kernels using a blur prediction
network that exploits blur-related scene and camera information and is subject
to a blur-aware sparsity constraint. Besides, we introduce a dynamic Gaussian
densification strategy to mitigate the lack of Gaussians for incomplete
regions, and boost the performance of novel view synthesis by incorporating
unseen view information to constrain scene optimization. Extensive experiments
show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in generating
photorealistic novel view synthesis from defocused and motion-blurred monocular
videos. Our code and trained model will be made publicly available.

diverse geometric priors, including camera poses, intrinsics, and depth maps,
while simultaneously generating multiple 3D representations: dense point
clouds, multi-view depth maps, camera parameters, surface normals, and 3D
Gaussians. This elegant and unified architecture leverages available prior
information to resolve structural ambiguities and delivers geometrically
consistent 3D outputs in a single forward pass. WorldMirror achieves
state-of-the-art performance across diverse benchmarks from camera, point map,
depth, and surface normal estimation to novel view synthesis, while maintaining
the efficiency of feed-forward inference. Code and models will be publicly
available soon.

*Yuan Xu,Zimu Zhang,Xiaoxuan Ma,Wentao Zhu,Yu Qiao,Yizhou Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种分层意图感知框架，通过认知机制建模人类意图并预测详细的情境行为，使用动态图卷积网络捕捉人-环境关系，在VR/AR系统中实现智能行为预测和环境适应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VR/AR系统需要智能适应用户行为以增强交互体验，这要求准确理解人类意图和预测未来情境行为（如注视方向和物体交互），但现有方法缺乏对驱动人-环境交互的认知过程建模。

Method: 提出分层意图感知框架，基于历史人类动态和场景上下文，首先识别潜在交互目标，然后预测细粒度未来行为；使用动态图卷积网络有效捕捉人-环境关系。

Result: 在真实世界基准测试和实时VR环境中的广泛实验表明，该方法在所有指标上均取得优越性能，能够实现预测用户行为和自适应虚拟环境的实际应用。

Conclusion: 该框架通过建模认知机制有效预测人类意图和情境行为，为主动式VR系统提供了实用解决方案，能够预见用户行为并相应调整虚拟环境。

Abstract: Virtual and augmented reality systems increasingly demand intelligent
adaptation to user behaviors for enhanced interaction experiences. Achieving
this requires accurately understanding human intentions and predicting future
situated behaviors - such as gaze direction and object interactions - which is
vital for creating responsive VR/AR environments and applications like
personalized assistants. However, accurate behavioral prediction demands
modeling the underlying cognitive processes that drive human-environment
interactions. In this work, we introduce a hierarchical, intention-aware
framework that models human intentions and predicts detailed situated behaviors
by leveraging cognitive mechanisms. Given historical human dynamics and the
observation of scene contexts, our framework first identifies potential
interaction targets and forecasts fine-grained future behaviors. We propose a
dynamic Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to effectively capture
human-environment relationships. Extensive experiments on challenging
real-world benchmarks and live VR environment demonstrate the effectiveness of
our approach, achieving superior performance across all metrics and enabling
practical applications for proactive VR systems that anticipate user behaviors
and adapt virtual environments accordingly.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了AURA数据集，评估了四种水下视觉异常检测模型，发现模型性能对训练数据和正常场景定义高度敏感，建议使用软标签和共识标签来支持科学探索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下视频监测是评估海洋生物多样性的有效方法，但大量无事件视频使人工检查不切实际，需要自动识别异常事件。

Method: 引入首个多标注者水下VAD基准数据集AURA，评估四种基于深度神经网络的VAD模型，采用鲁棒的帧选择策略提取有意义的视频片段。

Result: 当前VAD模型性能差异显著，对训练数据量和正常场景视觉内容变化高度敏感，与多标注者比较显示模型表现不稳定。

Conclusion: 软标签和共识标签具有重要价值，为科学探索和可扩展的生物多样性监测提供了实用方法。

Abstract: Underwater video monitoring is a promising strategy for assessing marine
biodiversity, but the vast volume of uneventful footage makes manual inspection
highly impractical. In this work, we explore the use of visual anomaly
detection (VAD) based on deep neural networks to automatically identify
interesting or anomalous events. We introduce AURA, the first multi-annotator
benchmark dataset for underwater VAD, and evaluate four VAD models across two
marine scenes. We demonstrate the importance of robust frame selection
strategies to extract meaningful video segments. Our comparison against
multiple annotators reveals that VAD performance of current models varies
dramatically and is highly sensitive to both the amount of training data and
the variability in visual content that defines "normal" scenes. Our results
highlight the value of soft and consensus labels and offer a practical approach
for supporting scientific exploration and scalable biodiversity monitoring.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于局部补丁相似性的人脸相似度度量方法，通过将全局相似度分解为受限感受野的贡献，提供可解释的局部加性解释，无需依赖后处理分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏可靠的评估指标，后处理方法对模型实际推理的保真度存在不确定性，因此需要设计决策过程本身可解释的模型。

Method: 将两个人脸图像的相似度定义为补丁级相似度得分的总和，使用受限感受野来分解全局相似度。

Result: 在112x112人脸图像中使用小至28x28的补丁时仍能获得有竞争力的验证性能，使用56x56补丁时超越了最先进方法。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种内在可解释的人脸相似度度量，通过局部加性解释实现了高保真度的模型推理过程可视化。

Abstract: Understanding how deep neural networks make decisions is crucial for
analyzing their behavior and diagnosing failure cases. In computer vision, a
common approach to improve interpretability is to assign importance to
individual pixels using post-hoc methods. Although they are widely used to
explain black-box models, their fidelity to the model's actual reasoning is
uncertain due to the lack of reliable evaluation metrics. This limitation
motivates an alternative approach, which is to design models whose decision
processes are inherently interpretable. To this end, we propose a face
similarity metric that breaks down global similarity into contributions from
restricted receptive fields. Our method defines the similarity between two face
images as the sum of patch-level similarity scores, providing a locally
additive explanation without relying on post-hoc analysis. We show that the
proposed approach achieves competitive verification performance even with
patches as small as 28x28 within 112x112 face images, and surpasses
state-of-the-art methods when using 56x56 patches.

Abstract: Identifying drones and birds correctly is essential for keeping the skies
safe and improving security systems. Using the VIP CUP 2025 dataset, which
provides both RGB and infrared (IR) images, this study presents EGD-YOLOv8n, a
new lightweight yet powerful model for object detection. The model improves how
image features are captured and understood, making detection more accurate and
efficient. It uses smart design changes and attention layers to focus on
important details while reducing the amount of computation needed. A special
detection head helps the model adapt to objects of different shapes and sizes.
We trained three versions: one using RGB images, one using IR images, and one
combining both. The combined model achieved the best accuracy and reliability
while running fast enough for real-time use on common GPUs.

Motivation: 随着CT检查量增加，需要自动化工具支持放射科医生。现有3D CNN方法难以捕捉长程依赖，而Vision Transformers需要大量领域特定预训练。

Method: 将3D CT体积表示为结构化图，轴向切片三元组作为节点，通过谱图卷积处理，考虑切片间依赖关系同时保持临床部署兼容的复杂度。

Result: 在3个独立机构数据集上训练评估，实现强跨数据集泛化，与最先进视觉编码器性能相当。消融研究评估了不同聚合策略、边权重方案和图连接模式。

Conclusion: 该方法在胸部CT多标签分类中表现优异，并展示了在放射报告生成和腹部CT数据上的更广泛适用性。

Abstract: With the growing volume of CT examinations, there is an increasing demand for
automated tools such as organ segmentation, abnormality detection, and report
generation to support radiologists in managing their clinical workload.
Multi-label classification of 3D Chest CT scans remains a critical yet
challenging problem due to the complex spatial relationships inherent in
volumetric data and the wide variability of abnormalities. Existing methods
based on 3D convolutional neural networks struggle to capture long-range
dependencies, while Vision Transformers often require extensive pre-training on
large-scale, domain-specific datasets to perform competitively. In this work,
we propose a 2.5D alternative by introducing a new graph-based framework that
represents 3D CT volumes as structured graphs, where axial slice triplets serve
as nodes processed through spectral graph convolution, enabling the model to
reason over inter-slice dependencies while maintaining complexity compatible
with clinical deployment. Our method, trained and evaluated on 3 datasets from
independent institutions, achieves strong cross-dataset generalization, and
shows competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art visual encoders. We
further conduct comprehensive ablation studies to evaluate the impact of
various aggregation strategies, edge-weighting schemes, and graph connectivity
patterns. Additionally, we demonstrate the broader applicability of our
approach through transfer experiments on automated radiology report generation
and abdominal CT data.\\ This work extends our previous contribution presented
at the MICCAI 2025 EMERGE Workshop.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下图像合成质量受到颜色衰减和浑浊等光学现象影响，这些现象在不同水域表现为不同的风格变化。现有生成模型难以建模多样水下环境的非均匀条件。

Method: 使用K-means聚类将数据集划分为风格特定域，采用分离的编码器获取风格和内容的潜在空间，通过AdaIN整合潜在表示并解码生成最终合成图像，每个风格聚类独立训练以保持域特定特征。

Result: 模型取得最先进性能：SSIM为0.9012，平均PSNR为32.5118 dB，FID为13.3728。

Conclusion: DISC-GAN框架通过风格-内容解耦和聚类特定训练策略，能够有效生成逼真的水下图像，解决了水下环境多样性带来的挑战。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel framework, Disentangled Style-Content GAN
(DISC-GAN), which integrates style-content disentanglement with a
cluster-specific training strategy towards photorealistic underwater image
synthesis. The quality of synthetic underwater images is challenged by optical
due to phenomena such as color attenuation and turbidity. These phenomena are
represented by distinct stylistic variations across different waterbodies, such
as changes in tint and haze. While generative models are well-suited to capture
complex patterns, they often lack the ability to model the non-uniform
conditions of diverse underwater environments. To address these challenges, we
employ K-means clustering to partition a dataset into style-specific domains.
We use separate encoders to get latent spaces for style and content; we further
integrate these latent representations via Adaptive Instance Normalization
(AdaIN) and decode the result to produce the final synthetic image. The model
is trained independently on each style cluster to preserve domain-specific
characteristics. Our framework demonstrates state-of-the-art performance,
obtaining a Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) of 0.9012, an average Peak
Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) of 32.5118 dB, and a Frechet Inception Distance
(FID) of 13.3728.

TL;DR: 提出imHead，一种新型隐式3D可变形模型，能够表示复杂的全头形状并支持局部编辑，通过引入区域特定的潜在表示来避免昂贵的潜在空间大小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统3D可变形模型由于严格的拓扑结构和线性特性，难以表示复杂的全头形状。现有方法将潜在空间划分为局部组件，导致潜在空间尺寸过大。

Method: 保留单一紧凑的身份空间，引入中间区域特定潜在表示来实现局部编辑。使用包含4000个不同身份的大规模数据集进行训练。

Result: 在表示多样化身份和表情方面表现出色，优于先前方法。模型能够提供可解释的3D面部操作解决方案。

Conclusion: imHead模型在表达能力和局部编辑能力方面均优于现有方法，为大规模3D头部建模迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: Over the last years, 3D morphable models (3DMMs) have emerged as a
state-of-the-art methodology for modeling and generating expressive 3D avatars.
However, given their reliance on a strict topology, along with their linear
nature, they struggle to represent complex full-head shapes. Following the
advent of deep implicit functions, we propose imHead, a novel implicit 3DMM
that not only models expressive 3D head avatars but also facilitates localized
editing of the facial features. Previous methods directly divided the latent
space into local components accompanied by an identity encoding to capture the
global shape variations, leading to expensive latent sizes. In contrast, we
retain a single compact identity space and introduce an intermediate
region-specific latent representation to enable local edits. To train imHead,
we curate a large-scale dataset of 4K distinct identities, making a
step-towards large scale 3D head modeling. Under a series of experiments we
demonstrate the expressive power of the proposed model to represent diverse
identities and expressions outperforming previous approaches. Additionally, the
proposed approach provides an interpretable solution for 3D face manipulation,
allowing the user to make localized edits.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高质量的公开分割标注对图像处理领域至关重要，特别是对于大量目标的体积图像标注耗时且具有挑战性。

Method: 三名独立标注者对Cell Tracking Challenge中的MDA231细胞序列进行3D时间推移分割标注，并与CTC提供的自动标注和跟踪标记进行比较验证。

Result: 创建的标注与CTC发布的跟踪标记一致，分割精度在标注者间变异范围内，且比CTC自动标注更好地反映了输入图像的复杂性。

Conclusion: 该数据集可用于细胞分割的测试和训练，以及分析高度动态物体的3D形状。

Abstract: High-quality, publicly available segmentation annotations of image and video
datasets are critical for advancing the field of image processing. In
particular, annotations of volumetric images of a large number of targets are
time-consuming and challenging. In (Melnikova, A., & Matula, P., 2025), we
presented the first publicly available full 3D time-lapse segmentation
annotations of migrating cells with complex dynamic shapes. Concretely, three
distinct humans annotated two sequences of MDA231 human breast carcinoma cells
(Fluo-C3DL-MDA231) from the Cell Tracking Challenge (CTC).
  This paper aims to provide a comprehensive description of the dataset and
accompanying experiments that were not included in (Melnikova, A., & Matula,
P., 2025) due to limitations in publication space. Namely, we show that the
created annotations are consistent with the previously published tracking
markers provided by the CTC organizers and the segmentation accuracy measured
based on the 2D gold truth of CTC is within the inter-annotator variability
margins. We compared the created 3D annotations with automatically created
silver truth provided by CTC. We have found the proposed annotations better
represent the complexity of the input images. The presented annotations can be
used for testing and training cell segmentation, or analyzing 3D shapes of
highly dynamic objects.

Abstract: Clouds remain a critical challenge in optical satellite imagery, hindering
reliable analysis for environmental monitoring, land cover mapping, and climate
research. To overcome this, we propose MSCloudCAM, a Cross-Attention with
Multi-Scale Context Network tailored for multispectral and multi-sensor cloud
segmentation. Our framework exploits the spectral richness of Sentinel-2
(CloudSEN12) and Landsat-8 (L8Biome) data to classify four semantic categories:
clear sky, thin cloud, thick cloud, and cloud shadow. MSCloudCAM combines a
Swin Transformer backbone for hierarchical feature extraction with multi-scale
context modules ASPP and PSP for enhanced scale-aware learning. A
Cross-Attention block enables effective multisensor and multispectral feature
fusion, while the integration of an Efficient Channel Attention Block (ECAB)
and a Spatial Attention Module adaptively refine feature representations.
Comprehensive experiments on CloudSEN12 and L8Biome demonstrate that MSCloudCAM
delivers state-of-the-art segmentation accuracy, surpassing leading baseline
architectures while maintaining competitive parameter efficiency and FLOPs.
These results underscore the model's effectiveness and practicality, making it
well-suited for large-scale Earth observation tasks and real-world
applications.

Motivation: 深度学习模型在胸部X光诊断中表现出潜力，但存在加剧医疗保健不平等的风险，因为性能在不同人口统计群体间存在差异。

Method: 扩展CNN-XGBoost管道以支持多标签分类，用XGBoost替换CNN的最后一层，并在DenseNet-121和ResNet-50等不同骨干网络上验证，与对抗训练、重加权、数据增强和主动学习等传统方法进行比较。

Conclusion: 该方法为临床放射学中公平深度学习部署提供了一条实用有效的路径，特别是在CheXpert和MIMIC数据集上表现出色。

Abstract: Deep learning models have shown promise in improving diagnostic accuracy from
chest X-rays, but they also risk perpetuating healthcare disparities when
performance varies across demographic groups. In this work, we present a
comprehensive bias detection and mitigation framework targeting sex, age, and
race-based disparities when performing diagnostic tasks with chest X-rays. We
extend a recent CNN-XGBoost pipeline to support multi-label classification and
evaluate its performance across four medical conditions. We show that replacing
the final layer of CNN with an eXtreme Gradient Boosting classifier improves
the fairness of the subgroup while maintaining or improving the overall
predictive performance. To validate its generalizability, we apply the method
to different backbones, namely DenseNet-121 and ResNet-50, and achieve
similarly strong performance and fairness outcomes, confirming its
model-agnostic design. We further compare this lightweight adapter training
method with traditional full-model training bias mitigation techniques,
including adversarial training, reweighting, data augmentation, and active
learning, and find that our approach offers competitive or superior bias
reduction at a fraction of the computational cost. Finally, we show that
combining eXtreme Gradient Boosting retraining with active learning yields the
largest reduction in bias across all demographic subgroups, both in and out of
distribution on the CheXpert and MIMIC datasets, establishing a practical and
effective path toward equitable deep learning deployment in clinical radiology.

Motivation: 现有基于transformer的3D人体网格恢复模型计算成本高、复杂度大，存在深度transformer架构和冗余token的问题

Method: 1. ECLM：选择性合并对MPJPE影响最小的transformer层；2. Mask-ToMe：合并对最终预测贡献小的背景token；3. 扩散解码器：结合时间上下文和从大规模运动捕捉数据学习的姿态先验

Result: 在多个基准测试中实现高达2.3倍的加速，同时性能略有提升

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了3D人体网格恢复中的计算效率问题，在保持精度的同时显著提升速度

Abstract: Recent transformer-based models for 3D Human Mesh Recovery (HMR) have
achieved strong performance but often suffer from high computational cost and
complexity due to deep transformer architectures and redundant tokens. In this
paper, we introduce two HMR-specific merging strategies: Error-Constrained
Layer Merging (ECLM) and Mask-guided Token Merging (Mask-ToMe). ECLM
selectively merges transformer layers that have minimal impact on the Mean Per
Joint Position Error (MPJPE), while Mask-ToMe focuses on merging background
tokens that contribute little to the final prediction. To further address the
potential performance drop caused by merging, we propose a diffusion-based
decoder that incorporates temporal context and leverages pose priors learned
from large-scale motion capture datasets. Experiments across multiple
benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves up to 2.3x speed-up while
slightly improving performance over the baseline.

Abstract: Real-world point cloud datasets have made significant contributions to the
development of LiDAR-based perception technologies, such as object segmentation
for autonomous driving. However, due to the limited number of instances in some
rare classes, the long-tail problem remains a major challenge in existing
datasets. To address this issue, we introduce a novel, synthetic point cloud
dataset named RareBoost3D, which complements existing real-world datasets by
providing significantly more instances for object classes that are rare in
real-world datasets. To effectively leverage both synthetic and real-world
data, we further propose a cross-domain semantic alignment method named CSC
loss that aligns feature representations of the same class across different
domains. Experimental results demonstrate that this alignment significantly
enhances the performance of LiDAR point cloud segmentation models over
real-world data.

Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在开放世界条件下的图像地理定位能力尚未得到全面评估，而这项任务在现实生活中具有挑战性和需求。

Method: 构建包含810张全球分布图像的EarthWhere基准，分为WhereCountry（500个多选题）和WhereStreet（310个细粒度任务）。采用最终预测指标和中间推理链评分，包括基于Shapley值的思考分数。

Result: 在13个最先进VLM上测试，Gemini-2.5-Pro表现最佳（56.32%），最强开源模型GLM-4.5V达到34.71%。发现网络搜索和推理在视觉线索有限时不能保证性能提升，模型存在区域偏见（某些区域得分高42.7%）。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了模型在减轻偏见和实现稳健细粒度定位方面的持续挑战，同时展示了VLM在地理定位任务中的潜力。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have advanced rapidly, yet their capacity for
image-grounded geolocation in open-world conditions, a task that is challenging
and of demand in real life, has not been comprehensively evaluated. We present
EarthWhere, a comprehensive benchmark for VLM image geolocation that evaluates
visual recognition, step-by-step reasoning, and evidence use. EarthWhere
comprises 810 globally distributed images across two complementary geolocation
scales: WhereCountry (i.e., 500 multiple-choice question-answering, with
country-level answer and panoramas) and WhereStreet (i.e., 310 fine-grained
street-level identification tasks requiring multi-step reasoning with optional
web search). For evaluation, we adopt the final-prediction metrics: location
accuracies within k km (Acc@k) for coordinates and hierarchical path scores for
textual localization. Beyond this, we propose to explicitly score intermediate
reasoning chains using human-verified key visual clues and a Shapley-reweighted
thinking score that attributes credit to each clue's marginal contribution. We
benchmark 13 state-of-the-art VLMs with web searching tools on our EarthWhere
and report different types of final answer accuracies as well as the calibrated
model thinking scores. Overall, Gemini-2.5-Pro achieves the best average
accuracy at 56.32%, while the strongest open-weight model, GLM-4.5V, reaches
34.71%. We reveal that web search and reasoning do not guarantee improved
performance when visual clues are limited, and models exhibit regional biases,
achieving up to 42.7% higher scores in certain areas than others. These
findings highlight not only the promise but also the persistent challenges of
models to mitigate bias and achieve robust, fine-grained localization. We
open-source our benchmark at https://github.com/UCSC-VLAA/EarthWhere.

Abstract: Contrastive Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong zero-shot
capabilities. However, their cross-modal alignment remains biased toward
English due to limited multilingual multimodal data. Recent multilingual
extensions have alleviated this gap but enforce instance-level alignment while
neglecting the global geometry of the shared embedding space. We address this
problem by introducing ToMCLIP (Topological Alignment for Multilingual CLIP), a
topology-aware framework aligning embedding spaces with topology-preserving
constraints. The proposed method applies persistent homology to define a
topological alignment loss and approximates persistence diagram with
theoretical error bounds using graph sparsification strategy. This work
validates the proposed approach, showing enhanced structural coherence of
multilingual representations, higher zero-shot accuracy on the CIFAR-100, and
stronger multilingual retrieval performance on the xFlickr&CO. Beyond VLMs, the
proposed approach provides a general method for incorporating topological
alignment into representation learning.

*Honghui Yuan,Keiji Yanai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SceneTextStylizer是一个无需训练的扩散模型框架，用于实现场景图像中文本区域的灵活高保真风格迁移，支持提示引导的文本风格转换，同时保持文本可读性和风格一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有场景文本编辑方法通常局限于内容替换和简单风格，缺乏自由风格迁移能力，无法实现灵活和局部化的文本风格编辑。

Method: 设计了特征注入模块利用扩散模型反演和自注意力机制有效迁移风格特征；引入区域控制机制通过距离变换掩码实现精确空间控制；基于傅里叶变换的风格增强模块提升风格丰富度。

Result: 大量实验表明，该方法在场景文本风格转换方面表现优异，在视觉保真度和文本保持方面均优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: SceneTextStylizer框架成功解决了场景文本灵活风格迁移的挑战，实现了高质量、可控的文本风格编辑。

Abstract: With the rapid development of diffusion models, style transfer has made
remarkable progress. However, flexible and localized style editing for scene
text remains an unsolved challenge. Although existing scene text editing
methods have achieved text region editing, they are typically limited to
content replacement and simple styles, which lack the ability of free-style
transfer. In this paper, we introduce SceneTextStylizer, a novel training-free
diffusion-based framework for flexible and high-fidelity style transfer of text
in scene images. Unlike prior approaches that either perform global style
transfer or focus solely on textual content modification, our method enables
prompt-guided style transformation specifically for text regions, while
preserving both text readability and stylistic consistency. To achieve this, we
design a feature injection module that leverages diffusion model inversion and
self-attention to transfer style features effectively. Additionally, a region
control mechanism is introduced by applying a distance-based changing mask at
each denoising step, enabling precise spatial control. To further enhance
visual quality, we incorporate a style enhancement module based on the Fourier
transform to reinforce stylistic richness. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method achieves superior performance in scene text style
transformation, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods in both visual
fidelity and text preservation.

TL;DR: FG-CLIP 2是一个双语视觉语言模型，通过细粒度监督和文本模态内对比损失，在英语和中文上实现了先进的细粒度对齐能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前模型在细粒度视觉语言理解方面存在局限，特别是在非英语环境中，难以准确捕捉对象属性、空间关系和语言表达的细微差异。

Method: 采用区域-文本匹配、长文本建模等多重判别目标，引入文本模态内对比损失来区分语义相似的描述，并在大规模英中双语数据上训练。

Result: 在29个数据集8个任务上的实验表明，FG-CLIP 2在两种语言上都超越了现有方法，达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: FG-CLIP 2显著提升了双语细粒度对齐能力，并发布了新的中文多模态理解基准，为未来研究提供了有力支持。

Abstract: Fine-grained vision-language understanding requires precise alignment between
visual content and linguistic descriptions, a capability that remains limited
in current models, particularly in non-English settings. While models like CLIP
perform well on global alignment, they often struggle to capture fine-grained
details in object attributes, spatial relations, and linguistic expressions,
with limited support for bilingual comprehension. To address these challenges,
we introduce FG-CLIP 2, a bilingual vision-language model designed to advance
fine-grained alignment for both English and Chinese. Our approach leverages
rich fine-grained supervision, including region-text matching and long-caption
modeling, alongside multiple discriminative objectives. We further introduce
the Textual Intra-modal Contrastive (TIC) loss to better distinguish
semantically similar captions. Trained on a carefully curated mixture of
large-scale English and Chinese data, FG-CLIP 2 achieves powerful bilingual
performance. To enable rigorous evaluation, we present a new benchmark for
Chinese multimodal understanding, featuring long-caption retrieval and bounding
box classification. Extensive experiments on 29 datasets across 8 tasks show
that FG-CLIP 2 outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art results
in both languages. We release the model, code, and benchmark to facilitate
future research on bilingual fine-grained alignment.

*Namhoon Kim,Sara Fridovich-Keil*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种无需校准的实例级不确定性指标，用于检测生成模型在逆问题中的分布偏移，通过测量重建稳定性来识别OOD样本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成模型作为数据驱动先验在逆问题中表现良好，但当测试图像超出训练分布时可能产生幻觉特征。现有方法需要校准数据集或只能提供启发式估计，无法有效检测分布偏移。

Method: 基于重建稳定性假设：ID图像在随机测量变化下重建稳定，而OOD图像重建不稳定。通过计算重建变异性作为分布偏移代理指标，无需训练分布知识或重新训练成本。

Result: 在MNIST数字断层重建实验中，仅用数字"0"训练的模型评估所有十个数字。OOD数字显示更高的重建变异性，与重建误差增加一致，验证了该指标的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法为生成先验提供了轻量级防护机制，可在分布内情况下实现激进测量减少，同时在先验应用于分布外时自动发出警告。

Abstract: Generative models have shown strong potential as data-driven priors for
solving inverse problems such as reconstructing medical images from
undersampled measurements. While these priors improve reconstruction quality
with fewer measurements, they risk hallucinating features when test images lie
outside the training distribution. Existing uncertainty quantification methods
in this setting (i) require an in-distribution calibration dataset, which may
not be available, (ii) provide heuristic rather than statistical estimates, or
(iii) quantify uncertainty from model capacity or limited measurements rather
than distribution shift. We propose an instance-level, calibration-free
uncertainty indicator that is sensitive to distribution shift, requires no
knowledge of the training distribution, and incurs no retraining cost. Our key
hypothesis is that reconstructions of in-distribution images remain stable
under random measurement variations, while reconstructions of
out-of-distribution (OOD) images exhibit greater instability. We use this
stability as a proxy for detecting distribution shift. Our proposed OOD
indicator is efficiently computable for any computational imaging inverse
problem; we demonstrate it on tomographic reconstruction of MNIST digits, where
a learned proximal network trained only on digit "0" is evaluated on all ten
digits. Reconstructions of OOD digits show higher variability and
correspondingly higher reconstruction error, validating this indicator. These
results suggest a deployment strategy that pairs generative priors with
lightweight guardrails, enabling aggressive measurement reduction for
in-distribution cases while automatically warning when priors are applied out
of distribution.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IUT-Plug是一个基于图像理解树(IUT)的模块，通过显式结构化推理增强现有交错视觉语言模型，解决逻辑、对象身份和风格方面的上下文漂移问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型(GPT-4、DALL-E等)在多模态图像-文本生成中难以保持逻辑、对象身份和风格的一致性，限制了在复杂图像-文本输入输出场景中的泛化能力。

Method: 采用两阶段框架：1)动态IUT-Plug提取模块将视觉场景解析为层次符号结构；2)协调的叙事流和图像合成机制确保跨模态一致性。

Result: 实验结果表明，IUT-Plug不仅提高了现有基准测试的准确性，还在多样化多模态问答场景中有效缓解了三种关键形式的上下文漂移。

Conclusion: IUT-Plug通过结构化推理有效解决了视觉语言模型中的上下文漂移问题，提升了多模态生成的一致性和准确性。

Abstract: Existing vision language models (VLMs), including GPT-4 and DALL-E, often
struggle to preserve logic, object identity, and style in multimodal image-text
generation. This limitation significantly hinders the generalization capability
of VLMs in complex image-text input-output scenarios. To address this issue, we
propose IUT-Plug, a module grounded in an Image Understanding Tree (IUT), which
enhances existing interleaved VLMs through explicit structured reasoning,
thereby mitigating context drift in logic, entity identity, and style. The
proposed framework operates in two stages. (1) A dynamic IUT-Plug extraction
module parses visual scenes into hierarchical symbolic structures. (2) A
coordinated narrative-flow and image synthesis mechanism ensures cross-modal
consistency. To evaluate our approach, we construct a novel benchmark based on
3,000 real human-generated question-answer pairs over fine-tuned large models,
introducing a dynamic evaluation protocol for quantifying context drift in
interleaved VLMs. Experimental results demonstrate that IUT-Plug not only
improves accuracy on established benchmarks but also effectively alleviates the
three critical forms of context drift across diverse multimodal question
answering (QA) scenarios.

TL;DR: Chart-RVR是一个通过可验证奖励和GRPO微调LVLMs的框架，提升图表推理的鲁棒性和可解释性，在多个基准测试中达到SOTA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LVLMs在分布外数据上表现不佳，且生成思维链时性能进一步下降，限制了可解释性。

Method: 结合Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)和三个自动可验证奖励：正确图表类型分类、忠实图表表格重建、过程一致性。

Result: 在30亿参数LVLMs上，Chart-RVR在分布内外数据集上均优于标准监督微调，缩小OOD性能差距，提高思维链忠实度，在6个图表推理基准上达到SOTA。

Conclusion: Chart-RVR通过可验证奖励和GRPO训练出更可靠、可解释的图表推理模型，增强了信任和可靠性。

Abstract: The capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have reached
state-of-the-art on many visual reasoning tasks, including chart reasoning, yet
they still falter on out-of-distribution (OOD) data, and degrade further when
asked to produce their chain-of-thought (CoT) rationales, limiting
explainability. We present Chart-RVR, a general framework that fine-tunes LVLMs
to be more robust and explainable for chart reasoning by coupling Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with automatically verifiable rewards. Our
framework comprises of three rewards that maximize: (i) correct chart-type
classification, (ii) faithful chart table reconstruction, and (iii) process
conformity. Applied to 3-billion-parameter LVLMs, Chart-RVR consistently
outperforms standard supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on both in-distribution and
out-of-distribution datasets, closing the OOD performance gap while improving
rationale fidelity. The resulting models, the Chart-RVR-3B series, achieve
state-of-the-art results on six chart-reasoning benchmarks spanning in-domain
and OOD settings, surpassing all existing models of comparable size. Beyond
accuracy, Chart-RVR yields more interpretable CoT rationales, strengthening
trust and reliability - showcasing the power of verifiable rewards with GRPO
for training reliable, interpretable chart-reasoning models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态模型容易过拟合强模态，导致弱模态的贡献被抑制，影响模型性能。需要解决模态不平衡问题来提升多模态视频理解的效果。

Method: 首先提出MM方法，在多模态特征层面应用Mixup策略生成虚拟特征-标签对；然后提出B-MM方法，根据各模态对学习目标的相对贡献动态调整混合比例。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，所提方法能有效提升泛化能力和多模态鲁棒性。

Conclusion: MM和B-MM方法通过特征混合和动态调整策略，成功缓解了多模态学习中的模态不平衡问题，提高了模型的泛化性能。

Abstract: Multimodal video understanding plays a crucial role in tasks such as action
recognition and emotion classification by combining information from different
modalities. However, multimodal models are prone to overfitting strong
modalities, which can dominate learning and suppress the contributions of
weaker ones. To address this challenge, we first propose Multimodal Mixup (MM),
which applies the Mixup strategy at the aggregated multimodal feature level to
mitigate overfitting by generating virtual feature-label pairs. While MM
effectively improves generalization, it treats all modalities uniformly and
does not account for modality imbalance during training. Building on MM, we
further introduce Balanced Multimodal Mixup (B-MM), which dynamically adjusts
the mixing ratios for each modality based on their relative contributions to
the learning objective. Extensive experiments on several datasets demonstrate
the effectiveness of our methods in improving generalization and multimodal
robustness.

Abstract: With the recent emergence of revolutionary autonomous agentic systems,
research community is witnessing a significant shift from traditional static,
passive, and domain-specific AI agents toward more dynamic, proactive, and
generalizable agentic AI. Motivated by the growing interest in agentic AI and
its potential trajectory toward AGI, we present a comprehensive survey on
Agentic Multimodal Large Language Models (Agentic MLLMs). In this survey, we
explore the emerging paradigm of agentic MLLMs, delineating their conceptual
foundations and distinguishing characteristics from conventional MLLM-based
agents. We establish a conceptual framework that organizes agentic MLLMs along
three fundamental dimensions: (i) Agentic internal intelligence functions as
the system's commander, enabling accurate long-horizon planning through
reasoning, reflection, and memory; (ii) Agentic external tool invocation,
whereby models proactively use various external tools to extend their
problem-solving capabilities beyond their intrinsic knowledge; and (iii)
Agentic environment interaction further situates models within virtual or
physical environments, allowing them to take actions, adapt strategies, and
sustain goal-directed behavior in dynamic real-world scenarios. To further
accelerate research in this area for the community, we compile open-source
training frameworks, training and evaluation datasets for developing agentic
MLLMs. Finally, we review the downstream applications of agentic MLLMs and
outline future research directions for this rapidly evolving field. To
continuously track developments in this rapidly evolving field, we will also
actively update a public repository at

Abstract: 3D Gaussian inpainting, a critical technique for numerous applications in
virtual reality and multimedia, has made significant progress with pretrained
diffusion models. However, ensuring multi-view consistency, an essential
requirement for high-quality inpainting, remains a key challenge. In this work,
we present PAInpainter, a novel approach designed to advance 3D Gaussian
inpainting by leveraging perspective-aware content propagation and consistency
verification across multi-view inpainted images. Our method iteratively refines
inpainting and optimizes the 3D Gaussian representation with multiple views
adaptively sampled from a perspective graph. By propagating inpainted images as
prior information and verifying consistency across neighboring views,
PAInpainter substantially enhances global consistency and texture fidelity in
restored 3D scenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of
PAInpainter over existing methods. Our approach achieves superior 3D inpainting

Motivation: 现代扩散模型在多实例图像生成中存在关键限制，难以实现对物体布局的精确控制，以及保持多个不同主体身份的一致性。

Method: 提出ContextGen框架，包含两个关键技术：上下文布局锚定机制将复合布局图像整合到生成上下文中，确保物体精确定位；身份一致性注意力机制利用参考图像确保多个实例的身份一致性。还构建了IMIG-100K数据集。

Result: 大量实验表明，ContextGen在控制精度、身份保真度和整体视觉质量方面均优于现有方法，达到了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: ContextGen通过创新的布局锚定和身份一致性机制，有效解决了多实例图像生成的挑战，为相关领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-instance image generation (MIG) remains a significant challenge for
modern diffusion models due to key limitations in achieving precise control
over object layout and preserving the identity of multiple distinct subjects.
To address these limitations, we introduce ContextGen, a novel Diffusion
Transformer framework for multi-instance generation that is guided by both
layout and reference images. Our approach integrates two key technical
contributions: a Contextual Layout Anchoring (CLA) mechanism that incorporates
the composite layout image into the generation context to robustly anchor the
objects in their desired positions, and Identity Consistency Attention (ICA),
an innovative attention mechanism that leverages contextual reference images to
ensure the identity consistency of multiple instances. Recognizing the lack of
large-scale, hierarchically-structured datasets for this task, we introduce
IMIG-100K, the first dataset with detailed layout and identity annotations.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that ContextGen sets a new state-of-the-art,
outperforming existing methods in control precision, identity fidelity, and
overall visual quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基础模型在复杂低对比度医学图像中难以区分肿瘤与正常组织的问题，特别是当恶性肿瘤与正常器官形态相似时，上下文区分变得困难。

Method: 1) 前景感知模块放大背景与整个体积空间的差异；2) 基于小波变换的特征级频率增强模块提取高频特征；3) 边缘约束模块保持分割边界的几何连续性。

Result: 在多个医学数据集上的广泛实验表明，该框架在所有指标上都表现出优越性能，特别是在复杂条件下的鲁棒性和精细结构识别方面。

Conclusion: FASS框架显著提升了低对比度图像的分割效果，为更多样化和复杂的医学成像场景应用铺平了道路。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of tumors and adjacent normal tissues in medical images
is essential for surgical planning and tumor staging. Although foundation
models generally perform well in segmentation tasks, they often struggle to
focus on foreground areas in complex, low-contrast backgrounds, where some
malignant tumors closely resemble normal organs, complicating contextual
differentiation. To address these challenges, we propose the Foreground-Aware
Spectrum Segmentation (FASS) framework. First, we introduce a foreground-aware
module to amplify the distinction between background and the entire volume
space, allowing the model to concentrate more effectively on target areas.
Next, a feature-level frequency enhancement module, based on wavelet transform,
extracts discriminative high-frequency features to enhance boundary recognition
and detail perception. Eventually, we introduce an edge constraint module to
preserve geometric continuity in segmentation boundaries. Extensive experiments
on multiple medical datasets demonstrate superior performance across all
metrics, validating the effectiveness of our framework, particularly in
robustness under complex conditions and fine structure recognition. Our
framework significantly enhances segmentation of low-contrast images, paving
the way for applications in more diverse and complex medical imaging scenarios.

Motivation: 现代视觉语言模型在组合推理方面存在持续弱点，特别是在理解图像中多个对象、属性和关系交互时表现不佳。现有方法要么资源密集，要么缺乏可解释的推理过程。

Method: 提出COCO-Tree方法，通过从训练有素的大型语言模型学习精心设计的神经符号概念树来增强VLM输出，采用波束搜索启发的推理过程。

Result: 在四个组合性基准测试（Winoground、EqBench、ColorSwap、SugarCrepe）和七个不同规模的开源VLM上，COCO-Tree相比基线显著提升了5-10%的组合泛化性能。

Conclusion: COCO-Tree有效提升了VLM的组合推理能力，同时提供了模型预测的可解释理由，在资源效率和可解释性方面优于现有方法。

Abstract: Compositional reasoning remains a persistent weakness of modern vision
language models (VLMs): they often falter when a task hinges on understanding
how multiple objects, attributes, and relations interact within an image.
Multiple research works have attempted to improve compositionality performance
by creative tricks such as improving prompt structure, chain of thought
reasoning, etc. A more recent line of work attempts to impart additional
reasoning in VLMs using well-trained Large Language Models (LLMs), which are
far superior in linguistic understanding than VLMs to compensate for the
limited linguistic prowess of VLMs. However, these approaches are either
resource-intensive or do not provide an interpretable reasoning process. In
this paper, we present 'COCO-Tree' - a novel approach that augments VLM outputs
with carefully designed neurosymbolic concept trees learned from LLMs to
improve VLM's linguistic reasoning. COCO-Tree's beam search-inspired reasoning
process boosts compositionality performance and provides a rationale behind VLM
predictions. Empirical results on four compositionality benchmarks, Winoground,
EqBench, ColorSwap, and SugarCrepe, in seven different open-source VLMs with
varying sizes, demonstrate that COCO-Tree significantly improves compositional
generalization by 5-10% over baselines.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频人体姿态估计方法在统一建模时空关系时难以平衡全局动态上下文和局部运动细节，且存在二次复杂度问题。Mamba模型在长序列建模方面表现出色但仅限于1D数据，需要扩展到视频领域。

Method: 提出全局时空Mamba进行6D选择性时空扫描和时空调制扫描合并来提取全局表示，同时引入基于窗口化时空扫描的局部细化Mamba来增强关键点局部运动的高频细节。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上的大量实验表明，该模型优于最先进的VHPE方法，同时实现了更好的计算权衡。

Conclusion: 该框架成功将Mamba扩展到视频人体姿态估计，通过分离的全局局部建模机制有效解决了现有方法的局限性，在性能和计算效率方面都取得了显著提升。

Abstract: Modeling high-resolution spatiotemporal representations, including both
global dynamic contexts (e.g., holistic human motion tendencies) and local
motion details (e.g., high-frequency changes of keypoints), is essential for
video-based human pose estimation (VHPE). Current state-of-the-art methods
typically unify spatiotemporal learning within a single type of modeling
structure (convolution or attention-based blocks), which inherently have
difficulties in balancing global and local dynamic modeling and may bias the
network to one of them, leading to suboptimal performance. Moreover, existing
VHPE models suffer from quadratic complexity when capturing global
dependencies, limiting their applicability especially for high-resolution
sequences. Recently, the state space models (known as Mamba) have demonstrated
significant potential in modeling long-range contexts with linear complexity;
however, they are restricted to 1D sequential data. In this paper, we present a
novel framework that extends Mamba from two aspects to separately learn global
and local high-resolution spatiotemporal representations for VHPE.
Specifically, we first propose a Global Spatiotemporal Mamba, which performs 6D
selective space-time scan and spatial- and temporal-modulated scan merging to
efficiently extract global representations from high-resolution sequences. We
further introduce a windowed space-time scan-based Local Refinement Mamba to
enhance the high-frequency details of localized keypoint motions. Extensive
experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed model
outperforms state-of-the-art VHPE approaches while achieving better
computational trade-offs.

TL;DR: 提出GeoVLMath模型，通过文本描述辅助线构造来增强大视觉语言模型在几何问题中的推理能力，使用强化学习框架提升图文对齐效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前图像编辑模型难以精确绘制几何辅助线，而大视觉语言模型在处理文本描述方面更有优势，因此需要一种方法将辅助线构造转化为文本描述。

Method: 提出强化学习框架，使用跨模态奖励评估生成的辅助线描述与真实辅助线图的对齐程度，基于GRPO的强化学习阶段实现精确的图文对齐。

Result: 构建了AuxSolidMath数据集（3,018个几何问题），GeoVLMath在3B和7B规模上在辅助线推理基准测试中达到竞争性甚至优于开源和专有大视觉语言模型的性能。

Conclusion: 通过文本描述辅助线构造和强化学习框架，GeoVLMath成功解决了复杂几何问题中的辅助线推理挑战，在图文对齐和几何推理方面表现出色。

Abstract: Auxiliary lines are essential for solving complex geometric problems but
remain challenging for large vision-language models (LVLMs). Rather than
editing diagrams to draw auxiliary lines, which current image editing models
struggle to render with geometric precision, we generate textual descriptions
of auxiliary-line constructions to better align with the representational
strengths of LVLMs. To bridge the gap between textual descriptions and spatial
structure, we propose a reinforcement learning framework that enhances
diagram-text alignment. At the core of our approach is a cross-modal reward
that evaluates how well the generated auxiliary-line description for an
original diagram matches a ground-truth auxiliary-line diagram. Built on this
reward, we present GeoVLMath, an open-source LVLM tailored to auxiliary-line
reasoning in solid geometry. This fine-grained signal drives a GRPO-based RL
stage, yielding precise diagram-text alignment. To support training, we develop
a scalable data creation pipeline and construct AuxSolidMath, a dataset of
3,018 real-exam geometry problems with paired diagrams and aligned textual
fields. At the 3B and 7B scales, GeoVLMath achieves competitive and often
superior performance compared with strong open-source and proprietary LVLMs on
auxiliary-line reasoning benchmarks.

TL;DR: 提出了GIR-Bench基准，用于系统评估统一多模态模型在理解与生成一致性、推理驱动的文本到图像生成以及多步推理编辑三个方面的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏严格的推理中心化基准来系统评估统一多模态模型在理解与生成之间的对齐性及其在复杂视觉任务中的泛化潜力。

Method: 设计了GIR-Bench基准，包含三个互补视角：理解-生成一致性评估、推理驱动的文本到图像生成评估、多步推理编辑评估，并为每个子集设计了专门的任务评估流程。

Result: 实验表明，虽然统一模型在推理驱动的视觉任务中表现更好，但在理解与生成之间仍存在持续差距。

Conclusion: GIR-Bench为评估统一多模态模型提供了全面基准，揭示了当前模型在理解与生成对齐方面的局限性，为未来研究指明了方向。

Abstract: Unified multimodal models integrate the reasoning capacity of large language
models with both image understanding and generation, showing great promise for
advanced multimodal intelligence. However, the community still lacks a rigorous
reasoning-centric benchmark to systematically evaluate the alignment between
understanding and generation, and their generalization potential in complex
visual tasks. To this end, we introduce \textbf{GIR-Bench}, a comprehensive
benchmark that evaluates unified models across three complementary
perspectives. Firstly, we investigate understanding-generation consistency
(GIR-Bench-UGC), asking whether models can consistently leverage the same
knowledge in both understanding and generation tasks. Secondly, we investigate
whether models can perform reasoning-centric text-to-image generation that
requires applying logical constraints and implicit knowledge to generate
faithful visual content (GIR-Bench-T2I). Thirdly, we evaluate whether models
can handle multi-step reasoning in editing (GIR-Bench-Edit). For each subset,
we carefully design different task-specific evaluation pipelines tailored for
each task. This enables fine-grained and interpretable evaluation while
mitigating biases from the prevalent MLLM-as-a-Judge paradigm. Extensive
ablations over various unified models and generation-only systems have shown
that: Although unified models are more capable of reasoning-driven visual
tasks, they still exhibit a persistent gap between understanding and
generation. The data and code for GIR-Bench are available at

Abstract: While significant research has focused on developing embodied reasoning
capabilities using Vision-Language Models (VLMs) or integrating advanced VLMs
into Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models for end-to-end robot control, few
studies directly address the critical gap between upstream VLM-based reasoning
and downstream VLA policy learning. In this work, we take an initial step
toward bridging embodied reasoning with VLA policy learning by introducing
Vlaser - a Vision-Language-Action Model with synergistic embodied reasoning
capability, which is a foundational vision-language model designed to integrate
high-level reasoning with low-level control for embodied agents. Built upon the
high-quality Vlaser-6M dataset, Vlaser achieves state-of-the-art performance
across a range of embodied reasoning benchmarks - including spatial reasoning,
embodied grounding, embodied QA, and task planning. Furthermore, we
systematically examine how different VLM initializations affect supervised VLA
fine-tuning, offering novel insights into mitigating the domain shift between
internet-scale pre-training data and embodied-specific policy learning data.
Based on these insights, our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on the
WidowX benchmark and competitive performance on the Google Robot benchmark.

Motivation: 基础模型在零样本异常分割任务中展现出强大的泛化能力，但如何正确引导这些模型解决下游任务仍然是一个挑战。

Method: 两阶段框架：1) Co-Feature点提示生成模块，利用CLIP和SAM协作生成正负点提示，引导SAM专注于分割异常区域；2) 级联提示模块，使用混合提示与SAM的轻量级解码器级联，优化分割结果。

Result: 在多个数据集上实现了最先进的零样本异常分割结果，特别是在Visa数据集上，F1-max和AP指标分别比现有最佳方法高出10.3%和7.7%。

Conclusion: 该框架有效结合了CLIP和SAM的优势，在零样本异常分割任务中取得了显著性能提升，为工业异常检测提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Recently, the powerful generalization ability exhibited by foundation models
has brought forth new solutions for zero-shot anomaly segmentation tasks.
However, guiding these foundation models correctly to address downstream tasks
remains a challenge. This paper proposes a novel two-stage framework, for
zero-shot anomaly segmentation tasks in industrial anomaly detection. This
framework excellently leverages the powerful anomaly localization capability of
CLIP and the boundary perception ability of SAM.(1) To mitigate SAM's
inclination towards object segmentation, we propose the Co-Feature Point Prompt
Generation (PPG) module. This module collaboratively utilizes CLIP and SAM to
generate positive and negative point prompts, guiding SAM to focus on
segmenting anomalous regions rather than the entire object. (2) To further
optimize SAM's segmentation results and mitigate rough boundaries and isolated
noise, we introduce the Cascaded Prompts for SAM (CPS) module. This module
employs hybrid prompts cascaded with a lightweight decoder of SAM, achieving
precise segmentation of anomalous regions. Across multiple datasets, consistent
experimental validation demonstrates that our approach achieves
state-of-the-art zero-shot anomaly segmentation results. Particularly
noteworthy is our performance on the Visa dataset, where we outperform the
state-of-the-art methods by 10.3\% and 7.7\% in terms of {$F_1$-max} and AP
metrics, respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 喉癌影像研究缺乏标准化数据集来支持可重复的深度学习模型开发，这限制了AI在临床决策中的应用。

Method: 从TCIA六个集合中收集1,029个CT扫描，使用弱监督参数搜索框架提取喉部感兴趣区域，并评估了3D CNN、ResNet18/50/101、DenseNet121等架构在早期vs晚期和T4 vs非T4分类任务中的性能。

Result: 3D CNN在早期vs晚期分类任务中表现最佳（AUC-0.881，F1-macro-0.821），ResNet18在T4 vs非T4分类中表现最佳（AUC-0.892，F1-macro-0.646）。3D GradCAM可视化显示模型在非T4病例中更关注软骨周围区域，在T4预测中显示局灶性激活。

Conclusion: LaryngealCT通过开源数据、预训练模型和可解释性工具，为AI驱动的喉癌研究提供了可重复的基础，支持临床决策。

Abstract: Laryngeal cancer imaging research lacks standardised datasets to enable
reproducible deep learning (DL) model development. We present LaryngealCT, a
curated benchmark of 1,029 computed tomography (CT) scans aggregated from six
collections from The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA). Uniform 1 mm isotropic
volumes of interest encompassing the larynx were extracted using a weakly
supervised parameter search framework validated by clinical experts. 3D DL
architectures (3D CNN, ResNet18,50,101, DenseNet121) were benchmarked on (i)
early (Tis,T1,T2) vs. advanced (T3,T4) and (ii) T4 vs. non-T4 classification
tasks. 3D CNN (AUC-0.881, F1-macro-0.821) and ResNet18 (AUC-0.892,
F1-macro-0.646) respectively outperformed the other models in the two tasks.
Model explainability assessed using 3D GradCAMs with thyroid cartilage overlays
revealed greater peri-cartilage attention in non-T4 cases and focal activations
in T4 predictions. Through open-source data, pretrained models, and integrated
explainability tools, LaryngealCT offers a reproducible foundation for

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本引导扩散模型在人脸编辑任务中难以保持身份和结构一致性，需要解决这一限制。

Method: 将人脸表示分解为身份和属性特征，作为联合条件指导反演和反向扩散过程，实现身份和属性的独立控制。

Result: 支持仅使用文本提示的复杂多属性人脸编辑，无需区域特定输入，速度与DDIM反演相当，实验证明其有效性和实用性。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持身份一致性和结构一致性的同时，实现了精确的面部属性操作，为实际应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in text-guided diffusion models have shown promise for
general image editing via inversion techniques, but often struggle to maintain
ID and structural consistency in real face editing tasks. To address this
limitation, we propose a zero-shot face editing method based on ID-Attribute
Decoupled Inversion. Specifically, we decompose the face representation into ID
and attribute features, using them as joint conditions to guide both the
inversion and the reverse diffusion processes. This allows independent control
over ID and attributes, ensuring strong ID preservation and structural
consistency while enabling precise facial attribute manipulation. Our method
supports a wide range of complex multi-attribute face editing tasks using only
text prompts, without requiring region-specific input, and operates at a speed
comparable to DDIM inversion. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate its
practicality and effectiveness.

Abstract: This report presents an overview of the 7th Large-scale Video Object
Segmentation (LSVOS) Challenge held in conjunction with ICCV 2025. Besides the
two traditional tracks of LSVOS that jointly target robustness in realistic
video scenarios: Classic VOS (VOS), and Referring VOS (RVOS), the 2025 edition
features a newly introduced track, Complex VOS (MOSEv2). Building upon prior
insights, MOSEv2 substantially increases difficulty, introducing more
challenging but realistic scenarios including denser small objects, frequent
disappear/reappear events, severe occlusions, adverse weather and lighting,
etc., pushing long-term consistency and generalization beyond curated
benchmarks. The challenge retains standard ${J}$, $F$, and ${J\&F}$ metrics for
VOS and RVOS, while MOSEv2 adopts ${J\&\dot{F}}$ as the primary ranking metric
to better evaluate objects across scales and disappearance cases. We summarize
datasets and protocols, highlight top-performing solutions, and distill
emerging trends, such as the growing role of LLM/MLLM components and
memory-aware propagation, aiming to chart future directions for resilient,
language-aware video segmentation in the wild.

Motivation: 现有无源目标检测方法主要针对传统检测模型如Faster R-CNN，缺乏对新型DETR架构的专门适配，需要为DETR设计定制化的无源检测解决方案。

Method: 包含四个关键组件：基于目标性得分的样本重加权模块、基于匹配记忆库的对比学习模块、不确定性加权的查询融合特征蒸馏模块，以及改进的自训练流程。

Conclusion: FRANCK能够有效将源域预训练的DETR模型适应到目标域，具有增强的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Source-Free Object Detection (SFOD) enables knowledge transfer from a source
domain to an unsupervised target domain for object detection without access to
source data. Most existing SFOD approaches are either confined to conventional
object detection (OD) models like Faster R-CNN or designed as general solutions
without tailored adaptations for novel OD architectures, especially Detection
Transformer (DETR). In this paper, we introduce Feature Reweighting ANd
Contrastive Learning NetworK (FRANCK), a novel SFOD framework specifically
designed to perform query-centric feature enhancement for DETRs. FRANCK
comprises four key components: (1) an Objectness Score-based Sample Reweighting
(OSSR) module that computes attention-based objectness scores on multi-scale
encoder feature maps, reweighting the detection loss to emphasize
less-recognized regions; (2) a Contrastive Learning with Matching-based Memory
Bank (CMMB) module that integrates multi-level features into memory banks,
enhancing class-wise contrastive learning; (3) an Uncertainty-weighted
Query-fused Feature Distillation (UQFD) module that improves feature
distillation through prediction quality reweighting and query feature fusion;
and (4) an improved self-training pipeline with a Dynamic Teacher Updating
Interval (DTUI) that optimizes pseudo-label quality. By leveraging these
components, FRANCK effectively adapts a source-pre-trained DETR model to a
target domain with enhanced robustness and generalization. Extensive
experiments on several widely used benchmarks demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance, highlighting its effectiveness and
compatibility with DETR-based SFOD models.

Conclusion: 提出的框架通过整合文本注释和显式建模基元关系，显著提升了CAD图纸符号识别的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of Computer-Aided Design(CAD) drawings in
engineering, architecture, and industrial design, the ability to accurately
interpret and analyze these drawings has become increasingly critical. Among
various subtasks, panoptic symbol spotting plays a vital role in enabling
downstream applications such as CAD automation and design retrieval. Existing
methods primarily focus on geometric primitives within the CAD drawings to
address this task, but they face following major problems: they usually
overlook the rich textual annotations present in CAD drawings and they lack
explicit modeling of relationships among primitives, resulting in
incomprehensive understanding of the holistic drawings. To fill this gap, we
propose a panoptic symbol spotting framework that incorporates textual
annotations. The framework constructs unified representations by jointly
modeling geometric and textual primitives. Then, using visual features extract
by pretrained CNN as the initial representations, a Transformer-based backbone
is employed, enhanced with a type-aware attention mechanism to explicitly model
the different types of spatial dependencies between various primitives.
Extensive experiments on the real-world dataset demonstrate that the proposed
method outperforms existing approaches on symbol spotting tasks involving
textual annotations, and exhibits superior robustness when applied to complex
CAD drawings.

Motivation: 现有端到端自动驾驶方法依赖当前场景上下文，低估了场景动态性和时间演化的重要性，限制了在复杂驾驶场景中做出适应性决策的能力。

Method: SeerDrive框架包含两个关键组件：(1)未来感知规划，将预测的BEV特征注入轨迹规划器；(2)迭代场景建模和车辆规划，通过协作优化同时改进未来场景预测和轨迹生成。

Result: 在NAVSIM和nuScenes基准测试中，SeerDrive显著优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 通过联合建模未来场景演化和轨迹规划的闭环方法，能够有效提升自动驾驶系统在复杂场景中的决策能力。

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving methods aim to directly map raw sensor inputs
to future driving actions such as planned trajectories, bypassing traditional
modular pipelines. While these approaches have shown promise, they often
operate under a one-shot paradigm that relies heavily on the current scene
context, potentially underestimating the importance of scene dynamics and their
temporal evolution. This limitation restricts the model's ability to make
informed and adaptive decisions in complex driving scenarios. We propose a new
perspective: the future trajectory of an autonomous vehicle is closely
intertwined with the evolving dynamics of its environment, and conversely, the
vehicle's own future states can influence how the surrounding scene unfolds.
Motivated by this bidirectional relationship, we introduce SeerDrive, a novel
end-to-end framework that jointly models future scene evolution and trajectory
planning in a closed-loop manner. Our method first predicts future bird's-eye
view (BEV) representations to anticipate the dynamics of the surrounding scene,
then leverages this foresight to generate future-context-aware trajectories.
Two key components enable this: (1) future-aware planning, which injects
predicted BEV features into the trajectory planner, and (2) iterative scene
modeling and vehicle planning, which refines both future scene prediction and
trajectory generation through collaborative optimization. Extensive experiments
on the NAVSIM and nuScenes benchmarks show that SeerDrive significantly
outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型容易受到对抗攻击，现有防御方法如对抗训练计算成本高且泛化能力有限，传统净化方法会降低图像质量。

Method: 使用成对的对抗-干净图像数据集微调扩散模型，结合任务特定的方向性指导，并引入提示优化作为补充防御机制。

Result: 在图像描述和视觉问答任务上的实验表明，该方法显著提高了鲁棒性，并对未知攻击具有良好的迁移性。

Conclusion: 监督扩散去噪为多模态防御提供了有效解决方案，有助于MLLM在现实应用中的可靠部署。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable success in
tasks such as image captioning, visual question answering, and cross-modal
reasoning by integrating visual and textual modalities. However, their
multimodal nature also exposes them to adversarial threats, where attackers can
perturb either modality or both jointly to induce harmful, misleading, or
policy violating outputs. Existing defense strategies, such as adversarial
training and input purification, face notable limitations: adversarial training
typically improves robustness only against known attacks while incurring high
computational costs, whereas conventional purification approaches often suffer
from degraded image quality and insufficient generalization to complex
multimodal tasks.
  In this work, we focus on defending the visual modality, which frequently
serves as the primary entry point for adversarial manipulation. We propose a
supervised diffusion based denoising framework that leverages paired
adversarial clean image datasets to fine-tune diffusion models with
directional, task specific guidance. Unlike prior unsupervised purification
methods such as DiffPure, our approach achieves higher quality reconstructions
while significantly improving defense robustness in multimodal tasks.
Furthermore, we incorporate prompt optimization as a complementary defense
mechanism, enhancing resistance against diverse and unseen attack strategies.
  Extensive experiments on image captioning and visual question answering
demonstrate that our method not only substantially improves robustness but also
exhibits strong transferability to unknown adversarial attacks. These results
highlight the effectiveness of supervised diffusion based denoising for
multimodal defense, paving the way for more reliable and secure deployment of
MLLMs in real world applications.

Abstract: Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) is a critical task in computer vision
that enables models to recognize unseen combinations of known attributes and
objects during inference, addressing the combinatorial challenge of requiring
training data for every possible composition. This is particularly challenging
because the visual appearance of primitives is highly contextual; for example,
``small'' cats appear visually distinct from ``older'' ones, and ``wet'' cars
differ significantly from ``wet'' cats. Effectively modeling this contextuality
and the inherent compositionality is crucial for robust compositional zero-shot
recognition. This paper presents, to our knowledge, the first comprehensive
survey specifically focused on Compositional Zero-Shot Learning. We
systematically review the state-of-the-art CZSL methods, introducing a taxonomy
grounded in disentanglement, with four families of approaches: no explicit
disentanglement, textual disentanglement, visual disentanglement, and
cross-modal disentanglement. We provide a detailed comparative analysis of

TL;DR: 提出一种像素对齐的3D运动图表示方法，从真实视频中学习语义和功能上有意义的3D运动先验，能够从单张输入图像预测未来3D场景运动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决从真实世界视频中学习语义和功能上有意义的3D运动先验的挑战，以实现从单张输入图像预测未来3D场景运动。

Method: 提出像素对齐的Motion Map表示，从5万多真实视频创建大规模MoMaps数据库，并在这些表示上训练扩散模型。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法能够生成合理且语义一致的3D场景运动。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅合成3D轨迹，还提出了新的2D视频合成流程：先生成MoMap，然后根据其扭曲图像并完成基于点的渲染。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of learning semantically and functionally
meaningful 3D motion priors from real-world videos, in order to enable
prediction of future 3D scene motion from a single input image. We propose a
novel pixel-aligned Motion Map (MoMap) representation for 3D scene motion,
which can be generated from existing generative image models to facilitate
efficient and effective motion prediction. To learn meaningful distributions
over motion, we create a large-scale database of MoMaps from over 50,000 real
videos and train a diffusion model on these representations. Our motion
generation not only synthesizes trajectories in 3D but also suggests a new
pipeline for 2D video synthesis: first generate a MoMap, then warp an image
accordingly and complete the warped point-based renderings. Experimental
results demonstrate that our approach generates plausible and semantically
consistent 3D scene motion.

*Chen Liu,Wenfang Yao,Kejing Yin,William K. Cheung,Jing Qin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiPro框架通过区域感知解耦和多时间尺度对齐，解决纵向多模态数据中CXR序列冗余和与EHR时间不对齐的问题，在疾病进展识别和ICU预测任务上达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 纵向多模态数据（如EHR和连续CXR）对疾病进展建模至关重要，但面临两个关键挑战：连续CXR序列中的冗余（静态解剖区域主导临床有意义动态）以及稀疏、不规则成像与连续EHR数据之间的时间不对齐。

Method: 1. 在连续CXR中解耦静态（解剖）和动态（病理进展）特征，优先考虑疾病相关变化；2. 通过局部（成对区间级）和全局（全序列）同步，分层对齐这些静态和动态CXR特征与异步EHR数据。

Result: 在MIMIC数据集上的广泛实验表明，DiPro能有效提取时间临床动态，在疾病进展识别和一般ICU预测任务上实现最先进的性能。

Conclusion: DiPro框架通过解决多模态数据中的关键挑战，成功建模了连贯的疾病进展路径，为纵向临床数据分析提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Longitudinal multimodal data, including electronic health records (EHR) and
sequential chest X-rays (CXRs), is critical for modeling disease progression,
yet remains underutilized due to two key challenges: (1) redundancy in
consecutive CXR sequences, where static anatomical regions dominate over
clinically-meaningful dynamics, and (2) temporal misalignment between sparse,
irregular imaging and continuous EHR data. We introduce $\texttt{DiPro}$, a
novel framework that addresses these challenges through region-aware
disentanglement and multi-timescale alignment. First, we disentangle static
(anatomy) and dynamic (pathology progression) features in sequential CXRs,
prioritizing disease-relevant changes. Second, we hierarchically align these
static and dynamic CXR features with asynchronous EHR data via local (pairwise
interval-level) and global (full-sequence) synchronization to model coherent
progression pathways. Extensive experiments on the MIMIC dataset demonstrate
that $\texttt{DiPro}$ could effectively extract temporal clinical dynamics and
achieve state-of-the-art performance on both disease progression identification
and general ICU prediction tasks.

*Hao Tang,Shengfeng He,Jing Qin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SynTrans是一个新颖的少样本学习框架，通过从大型多模态模型转移多样化知识来增强现成的少样本学习器，在四个数据集上显著优于当前最先进方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的少样本学习方法虽然利用语义知识缓解数据稀缺问题，但由于数据简单性往往引入噪声和偏差。需要更有效地从大型多模态模型转移知识来提升少样本学习性能。

Method: 使用CLIP作为强教师模型，少样本视觉编码器作为弱学生模型，通过无监督代理任务蒸馏语义对齐的视觉知识；训练免费的协同知识挖掘模块促进多模态模型协作；视觉-语义桥接模块实现双向知识转移；视觉权重生成器和语义权重重构器自适应构建多模态少样本分类器。

Result: 在四个少样本学习数据集上的实验结果表明，即使搭配简单的少样本视觉编码器，SynTrans也能显著优于当前最先进方法。

Conclusion: SynTrans框架通过有效转移大型多模态模型的多样化知识，成功提升了少样本学习的性能，证明了协同知识转移在少样本学习中的有效性。

Abstract: Few-shot learning (FSL) addresses the challenge of classifying novel classes
with limited training samples. While some methods leverage semantic knowledge
from smaller-scale models to mitigate data scarcity, these approaches often
introduce noise and bias due to the data's inherent simplicity. In this paper,
we propose a novel framework, Synergistic Knowledge Transfer (SynTrans), which
effectively transfers diverse and complementary knowledge from large multimodal
models to empower the off-the-shelf few-shot learner. Specifically, SynTrans
employs CLIP as a robust teacher and uses a few-shot vision encoder as a weak
student, distilling semantic-aligned visual knowledge via an unsupervised proxy
task. Subsequently, a training-free synergistic knowledge mining module
facilitates collaboration among large multimodal models to extract high-quality
semantic knowledge. Building upon this, a visual-semantic bridging module
enables bi-directional knowledge transfer between visual and semantic spaces,
transforming explicit visual and implicit semantic knowledge into
category-specific classifier weights. Finally, SynTrans introduces a visual
weight generator and a semantic weight reconstructor to adaptively construct
optimal multimodal FSL classifiers. Experimental results on four FSL datasets
demonstrate that SynTrans, even when paired with a simple few-shot vision
encoder, significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods.

*Yaqi Zhao,Xiaochen Wang,Li Dong,Wentao Zhang,Yuhui Yuan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 扩散模型在文本到图像生成中难以准确遵循计数指令，研究发现仅扩大数据集和模型规模无法解决此问题，并提出通过向噪声先验注入计数感知布局信息的方法显著提升计数准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究扩散模型是否能够通过扩大数据集和模型规模来准确生成文本提示中指定的对象数量，因为现有模型在计数方面表现不佳。

Method: 构建了两个合成数据集进行严格评估，发现缩放假设不成立，并提出通过向噪声先验注入计数感知布局信息来控制对象数量的方法。

Result: 提出的方法在GrayCount250数据集上将准确率从20.0%提升到85.3%，在NaturalCount6数据集上从74.8%提升到86.3%，显示出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 扩散模型在计数任务上的失败主要源于对噪声初始化的过度依赖，而非文本提示中的明确数量信息，通过注入计数感知布局可以有效解决此问题。

Abstract: Numerosity remains a challenge for state-of-the-art text-to-image generation
models like FLUX and GPT-4o, which often fail to accurately follow counting
instructions in text prompts. In this paper, we aim to study a fundamental yet
often overlooked question: Can diffusion models inherently generate the correct
number of objects specified by a textual prompt simply by scaling up the
dataset and model size? To enable rigorous and reproducible evaluation, we
construct a clean synthetic numerosity benchmark comprising two complementary
datasets: GrayCount250 for controlled scaling studies, and NaturalCount6
featuring complex naturalistic scenes. Second, we empirically show that the
scaling hypothesis does not hold: larger models and datasets alone fail to
improve counting accuracy on our benchmark. Our analysis identifies a key
reason: diffusion models tend to rely heavily on the noise initialization
rather than the explicit numerosity specified in the prompt. We observe that
noise priors exhibit biases toward specific object counts. In addition, we
propose an effective strategy for controlling numerosity by injecting
count-aware layout information into the noise prior. Our method achieves
significant gains, improving accuracy on GrayCount250 from 20.0\% to 85.3\% and
on NaturalCount6 from 74.8\% to 86.3\%, demonstrating effective generalization
across settings.

### [162] [video-SALMONN S: Streaming Audio-Visual LLMs Beyond Length Limits via Memory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11129)
*Guangzhi Sun,Yixuan Li,Xiaodong Wu,Yudong Yang,Wei Li,Zejun Ma,Chao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了video-SALMONN S，首个能在固定内存预算下处理3小时视频（1 FPS，360p分辨率）的流式音频-视觉LLM，通过测试时训练内存模块和提示相关内存读取器实现长视频理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频理解LLM难以扩展到长视频流处理，离线方法需要调整帧率，流式方法通过合并或丢弃token会丢失信息，需要解决长视频连续处理的内存和效率问题。

Method: 引入测试时训练(TTT)内存模块持续更新token表示以捕获长程依赖，使用提示相关内存读取器从固定大小内存中选择性检索相关内容，采用Hessian-free共轭梯度优化TTT模块。

Result: 在长视频基准测试(Video-MME、LVBench、VideoEvalPro)中，模型能在10k帧和100万token的多小时视频上保持高质量理解，8B参数模型在Video-MME长分割上达到74.2%总体和67.8%的准确率。

Conclusion: video-SALMONN S是首个能在固定内存预算下处理超长视频的流式音频-视觉LLM，在长视频理解任务上超越了离线和流式基线方法。

Abstract: Continuous, high-frame-rate, high-resolution processing of long video streams
is critical for future AI agents, yet current video-understanding LLMs struggle
to scale. Offline, fixed-frame-number methods require the stream length to
adapt frame rates; streaming methods constrain memory by merging or discarding
tokens, losing information. We propose video-SALMONN S, a streaming
audio-visual LLM that, to our knowledge, is the first to process 3-hour videos
at 1 FPS and 360p resolution under a fixed memory budget. Our model introduces
(i) a test-time-training (TTT) memory module that continually updates token
representations to capture long-range dependencies by replacing token merging,
and (ii) a prompt-dependent memory reader that selectively retrieves
context-relevant content from fixed-size memory. The TTT module is optimised
with a Hessian-free conjugate-gradient procedure (TTT_HF) for efficient
adaptation. On long-video benchmarks (Video-MME, LVBench, VideoEvalPro),
video-SALMONN S sustains high-quality understanding on multi-hour videos with
10k frames and 1M tokens. Our 8B-parameter model achieves 74.2% overall and
67.8% on the Video-MME long split, outperforming both offline and streaming
baselines.

TL;DR: 开发了一种基于人工智能的形态学辅助集成模型，通过相位对比显微镜图像检测精子DNA碎片化，使用TUNEL检测作为金标准，实现了60%的敏感性和75%的特异性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统精液分析无法评估精子DNA碎片化(SDF)，这是男性生育能力评估的关键参数。需要开发非破坏性的实时检测方法来改善生殖医学中的诊断和治疗应用。

Method: 提出形态学辅助集成AI模型，结合图像处理技术和基于transformer的机器学习模型(GC-ViT)，通过相位对比图像预测精子DNA碎片化。与纯视觉transformer模型和仅形态学模型进行基准测试。

Result: 该框架实现了60%的敏感性和75%的特异性，能够通过非破坏性方法实时选择基于DNA完整性的精子。

Conclusion: 这种非破坏性方法代表了生殖医学的重要进展，为临床诊断和治疗应用提供了基于DNA完整性的实时精子选择能力。

Abstract: Sperm DNA fragmentation (SDF) is a critical parameter in male fertility
assessment that conventional semen analysis fails to evaluate. This study
presents the validation of a novel artificial intelligence (AI) tool designed
to detect SDF through digital analysis of phase contrast microscopy images,
using the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL)
assay as the gold standard reference. Utilising the established link between
sperm morphology and DNA integrity, the present work proposes a morphology
assisted ensemble AI model that combines image processing techniques with
state-of-the-art transformer based machine learning models (GC-ViT) for the
prediction of DNA fragmentation in sperm from phase contrast images. The
ensemble model is benchmarked against a pure transformer `vision' model as well
as a `morphology-only` model. Promising results show the proposed framework is
able to achieve sensitivity of 60\% and specificity of 75\%. This
non-destructive methodology represents a significant advancement in
reproductive medicine by enabling real-time sperm selection based on DNA
integrity for clinical diagnostic and therapeutic applications.

### [164] [Multiview Manifold Evidential Fusion for PolSAR Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11171)
*Junfei Shi,Haojia Zhang,Haiyan Jin,Junhuai Li,Xiaogang Song,Yuanfan Guo,Haonan Su,Weisi Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出MMEFnet方法，通过多流形证据融合有效结合PolSAR协方差矩阵和多特征，解决传统融合方法忽略几何结构和不确定性的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统PolSAR特征融合方法通常简单拼接特征或使用深度学习网络，但忽略了协方差矩阵和多特征位于不同流形上的几何结构差异，以及不同视图的重要性差异和不确定性，导致预测不可靠。

Method: 将协方差矩阵建模在Hermitian正定流形上，多特征建模在Grassmann流形上，构建两种不同的核度量学习网络学习流形表示，然后用可信多视图证据融合估计置信质量并量化不确定性，最后基于Dempster-Shafer理论融合证据。

Result: 在三个真实PolSAR数据集上的实验表明，该方法在准确性、鲁棒性和可解释性方面持续优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MMEFnet通过将PolSAR流形学习和证据融合集成到统一架构中，实现了更可靠和可解释的分类，为多视图融合提供了新框架。

Abstract: Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PolSAR) covariance matrices and their
extracted multi-features - such as scattering angle, entropy, texture, and
boundary descriptors - provide complementary and physically interpretable
information for image classification. Traditional fusion strategies typically
concatenate these features or employ deep learning networks to combine them.
However, the covariance matrices and multi-features, as two complementary
views, lie on different manifolds with distinct geometric structures. Existing
fusion methods also overlook the varying importance of different views and
ignore uncertainty, often leading to unreliable predictions. To address these
issues, we propose a Multiview Manifold Evidential Fusion (MMEFnet) method to
effectively fuse these two views. It gives a new framework to integrate PolSAR
manifold learning and evidence fusion into a unified architecture.
Specifically, covariance matrices are represented on the Hermitian Positive
Definite (HPD) manifold, while multi-features are modeled on the Grassmann
manifold. Two different kernel metric learning networks are constructed to
learn their manifold representations. Subsequently, a trusted multiview
evidence fusion, replacing the conventional softmax classifier, estimates
belief mass and quantifies the uncertainty of each view from the learned deep
features. Finally, a Dempster-Shafer theory-based fusion strategy combines
evidence, enabling a more reliable and interpretable classification. Extensive
experiments on three real-world PolSAR datasets demonstrate that the proposed
method consistently outperforms existing approaches in accuracy, robustness,
and interpretability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoPRS是一个基于多模态思维链的位置感知模型，通过可微分的热图将语言推理与分割任务连接起来，提高了可解释性和分割精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法直接将语言模型的隐藏特征连接到掩码解码器或表示文本位置，限制了可解释性和语义细节。

Method: 使用可学习的集中令牌聚合图像和推理文本特征，生成可微分的位置先验热图，通过轻量级解码器解码为精确掩码。

Result: 在RefCOCO系列和ReasonSeg数据集上，CoPRS在可比协议下达到或超过最佳报告指标，验证和测试分区性能均达到或超过先前最先进水平。

Conclusion: 热图质量强烈影响掩码质量，支持推理输出与下游掩码生成之间的一致性关联，该范式在连接推理和分割方面具有实用性。

Abstract: Existing works on reasoning segmentation either connect hidden features from
a language model directly to a mask decoder or represent positions in text,
which limits interpretability and semantic detail. To solve this, we present
CoPRS, a Multi-modal Chain-of-Thought (MCoT)-based positional perception model
that bridges language reasoning to segmentation through a differentiable and
interpretable positional prior instantiated as a heatmap. By making the
reasoning process clear via MCoT and expressing it as a dense, differentiable
heatmap, this interface enhances interpretability and diagnostic analysis and
yields more concentrated evidence on the target. A learnable concentration
token aggregates features of the image and reasoning text to generate this
positional prior, which is decoded to precise masks through a lightweight
decoder, providing a direct connection between reasoning and segmentation.
Across the RefCOCO series and ReasonSeg, CoPRS matches or surpasses the best
reported metrics on each standard split under comparable protocols, with
performance at or above prior state of the art across both validation and test
partitions. Extensive experiments reveal that the quality of the heatmap
strongly influences the resulting mask quality, supporting a consistent
association between the reasoning output and downstream mask generation.
Collectively, these findings support the utility of this paradigm in bridging
reasoning and segmentation and show advantages in concentration driven by
reasoning and predicting masks more precisely. Code, checkpoints and logs are
released at https://github.com/ZhenyuLU-Heliodore/CoPRS.git.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了PICO框架，通过量化特征列表示语义信息的概率来抑制嵌入交互中的风格干扰，在多个基准测试中优于现有方法5.2%-14.1%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统跨模态对齐方法假设嵌入仅包含语义信息，忽略了非语义信息（风格信息）的影响，导致信息偏差或丢失。需要分离风格和语义信息，仅对齐语义信息

Method: 提出PICO框架，量化每个特征列表示语义信息的概率，并将其作为嵌入交互的权重。使用基于性能反馈的加权函数进行原型迭代构建，确保语义概率的可靠性

Result: 在多个基准测试和模型骨干网络上进行广泛实验，PICO框架优于最先进方法5.2%-14.1%

Conclusion: PICO框架通过有效抑制风格干扰，显著提升了跨模态对齐性能，证明了分离语义和风格信息的重要性

Abstract: Cross-modal alignment is an important multi-modal task, aiming to bridge the
semantic gap between different modalities. The most reliable fundamention for
achieving this objective lies in the semantic consistency between matched
pairs. Conventional methods implicitly assume embeddings contain solely
semantic information, ignoring the impact of non-semantic information during
alignment, which inevitably leads to information bias or even loss. These
non-semantic information primarily manifest as stylistic variations in the
data, which we formally define as style information. An intuitive approach is
to separate style from semantics, aligning only the semantic information.
However, most existing methods distinguish them based on feature columns, which
cannot represent the complex coupling relationship between semantic and style
information. In this paper, we propose PICO, a novel framework for suppressing
style interference during embedding interaction. Specifically, we quantify the
probability of each feature column representing semantic information, and
regard it as the weight during the embedding interaction. To ensure the
reliability of the semantic probability, we propose a prototype iterative
construction method. The key operation of this method is a performance
feedback-based weighting function, and we have theoretically proven that the
function can assign higher weight to prototypes that bring higher performance
improvements. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks and model backbones
demonstrate the superiority of PICO, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by
5.2\%-14.1\%.

TL;DR: 提出G2L框架，通过知识蒸馏将千亿参数级病理基础模型的能力转移到仅占其15%参数的大型模型中，仅需目标癌症的1000张病理切片即可达到千亿级模型的性能水平。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决千亿级病理基础模型在实际应用中计算成本过高的问题，寻求在保持高性能的同时降低模型规模和计算需求的方法。

Method: 使用知识蒸馏技术，将千亿级教师模型的能力转移到参数少得多的大型学生模型中，仅需目标癌症的少量数据（1000张病理切片）进行蒸馏训练。

Result: 蒸馏后的大型模型不仅超越了同规模的最先进模型，在某些基准测试中甚至超过了千亿级教师模型和更大规模的模型，同时表现出更高的鲁棒性指数。

Conclusion: 该蒸馏方法是一种数据和参数高效的方式，能够在癌症特定应用中实现千亿级性能，而无需承担过高的计算负担。

Abstract: Recent studies in pathology foundation models have shown that scaling
training data, diversifying cancer types, and increasing model size
consistently improve their performance. However, giga-scale foundation models,
which are trained on hundreds of thousands of slides covering tens of cancer
types and contain billions of parameters, pose significant challenges for
practical use due to their tremendous computational costs in both development
and deployment. In this work, we present a novel strategy, named the G2L
framework, to increase the performance of large-scale foundation models, which
consist of only $15\%$ of the parameters of giga-scale models, to a comparable
performance level of giga-scale models in cancer-specific tasks. Our approach
applies knowledge distillation, transferring the capabilities of a giga-scale
model to a large-scale model, using just 1K pathology slides of a target cancer
(e.g., breast, prostate, etc.). The resulting distilled model not only
outperformed state-of-the-art models of the same size (i.e., large-scale)
across several benchmarks but also, interestingly, surpassed the giga-scale
teacher and huge-scale models in some benchmarks. In addition, the distilled
model exhibited a higher robustness index, indicating improved resilience to
image variations originating from multiple institutions. These findings suggest
that the proposed distillation approach for a large-scale model is a data- and
parameter-efficient way to achieve giga-scale-level performance for
cancer-specific applications without prohibitive computational burden.

*Bryan Chen Zhengyu Tan,Zheng Weihua,Zhengyuan Liu,Nancy F. Chen,Hwaran Lee,Kenny Tsu Wei Choo,Roy Ka-Wei Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BLEnD-Vis是一个多模态、多文化的基准测试，用于评估视觉语言模型在日常文化知识方面的鲁棒性，涵盖语言改写和视觉模态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着视觉语言模型在全球部署，评估其对文化知识的理解能力变得至关重要。现有评估主要关注静态回忆或孤立视觉基础，未能验证模型是否具备鲁棒且可迁移的文化理解能力。

Method: 基于BLEnD数据集构建313个文化基础问题模板，涵盖16个地区，生成三种对齐的多选题格式：文本基线、反向文本变体和VQA风格版本，包含4,916张图像和超过21,000个多选题实例。

Result: 当前VLM文化知识存在显著脆弱性，模型在语言改写下性能下降，视觉线索虽有助于性能但跨模态一致性低，特别是在资源较少地区整合文本和视觉理解面临挑战。

Conclusion: BLEnD-Vis为系统分析文化鲁棒性和多模态基础提供了关键测试平台，揭示了局限性并指导开发更具文化能力的视觉语言模型。

Abstract: As vision-language models (VLMs) are deployed globally, their ability to
understand culturally situated knowledge becomes essential. Yet, existing
evaluations largely assess static recall or isolated visual grounding, leaving
unanswered whether VLMs possess robust and transferable cultural understanding.
We introduce BLEnD-Vis, a multimodal, multicultural benchmark designed to
evaluate the robustness of everyday cultural knowledge in VLMs across
linguistic rephrasings and visual modalities. Building on the BLEnD dataset,
BLEnD-Vis constructs 313 culturally grounded question templates spanning 16
regions and generates three aligned multiple-choice formats: (i) a text-only
baseline querying from Region $\to$ Entity, (ii) an inverted text-only variant
(Entity $\to$ Region), and (iii) a VQA-style version of (ii) with generated
images. The resulting benchmark comprises 4,916 images and over 21,000
multiple-choice question (MCQ) instances, validated through human annotation.
BLEnD-Vis reveals significant fragility in current VLM cultural knowledge;
models exhibit performance drops under linguistic rephrasing and, whilst visual
cues often aid performance, low cross-modal consistency highlights challenges
in robustly integrating textual and visual understanding, particularly for
lower-resource regions. BLEnD-Vis thus provides a crucial testbed for
systematically analysing cultural robustness and multimodal grounding, exposing
limitations and guiding the development of more culturally competent VLMs.

Abstract: This paper explores the application of T5 models for Saudi Sign Language
(SSL) translation using a novel dataset. The SSL dataset includes three
challenging testing protocols, enabling comprehensive evaluation across
different scenarios. Additionally, it captures unique SSL characteristics, such
as face coverings, which pose challenges for sign recognition and translation.
In our experiments, we investigate the impact of pre-training on American Sign
Language (ASL) data by comparing T5 models pre-trained on the YouTubeASL
dataset with models trained directly on the SSL dataset. Experimental results
demonstrate that pre-training on YouTubeASL significantly improves models'
performance (roughly $3\times$ in BLEU-4), indicating cross-linguistic
transferability in sign language models. Our findings highlight the benefits of
leveraging large-scale ASL data to improve SSL translation and provide insights
into the development of more effective sign language translation systems. Our
code is publicly available at our GitHub repository.

TL;DR: 提出了FlexAC框架，通过调节多模态大语言模型中的关联推理强度，在忠实性和创造性之间实现灵活平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法缺乏调节关联推理强度的灵活性，限制了MLLMs在事实性和创造性场景中的适应性。

Method: 利用幻觉引导的中间表示编码关联方向，构建有效的关联引导向量，并通过任务特定的关联向量实现多维关联推理控制。

Result: 在Creation-MMBench上创造力提升5.8倍，在CHAIR上幻觉率降低29%，超越了现有基线方法。

Conclusion: FlexAC框架能够有效调节MLLMs的关联推理行为，在保持输出稳定性的同时增强模型在创造性任务中的表现。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) face an inherent trade-off between
faithfulness and creativity, as different tasks require varying degrees of
associative reasoning. However, existing methods lack the flexibility to
modulate this reasoning strength, limiting MLLMs' adaptability across factual
and creative scenarios. To bridge this gap, we propose equipping MLLMs with
mechanisms that enable flexible control over associative reasoning. We begin by
investigating the internal mechanisms underlying associative behavior in MLLMs
and find that: (1) middle layers play a pivotal role in shaping model's
associative tendencies, (2) modifying representations in these layers
effectively regulates associative reasoning strength, and (3) hallucinations
can be exploited to derive steering vectors that guide this modulation.
Building on these findings, we introduce Flexible Association Control (FlexAC),
a lightweight and training-free framework for modulating associative behavior
in MLLMs. FlexAC first induces hallucination-guided intermediate
representations to encode associative directions. Then, it selects
high-association instances to construct effective associative steering vectors,
whose strengths are adaptively calibrated to balance creative guidance with
output stability. Finally, recognizing the multi-dimensional nature of
associative reasoning, FlexAC incorporates task-specific associative vectors
derived from a forward pass on a few target-domain samples, enabling models to
follow diverse associative directions and better adapt to creative tasks.
Notably, our method achieves up to a 5.8x improvement in creativity on
Creation-MMBench and a 29% reduction in hallucination rate on CHAIR, surpassing
existing baselines and demonstrating its effectiveness in enabling flexible
control over associative reasoning in MLLMs. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于类别原型的监督对比学习方法，用于检测在线视频中的教育内容，特别是识字和数学类内容，通过多模态Transformer网络捕捉视觉和音频线索的交互。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着儿童早期在线媒体消费的增长，需要数据驱动工具来筛选适合幼儿的教育内容，特别是识字和数学类教育视频。

Method: 采用基于类别原型的监督对比学习方法，学习每个类别的原型表示，最小化同类样本与原型的距离，最大化不同类样本与原型的距离，使用多模态Transformer网络捕捉视觉和音频线索的交互。

Result: 在APPROVE数据集（193小时专家标注视频，19个类别）上优于强基线方法，在Youtube-8M和COIN等基准测试中也表现优异。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能有效检测在线视频中的细粒度教育内容，为教育工作者筛选适合幼儿的教育视频提供了有力工具。

Abstract: The recent growth in the consumption of online media by children during early
childhood necessitates data-driven tools enabling educators to filter out
appropriate educational content for young learners. This paper presents an
approach for detecting educational content in online videos. We focus on two
widely used educational content classes: literacy and math. For each class, we
choose prominent codes (sub-classes) based on the Common Core Standards. For
example, literacy codes include `letter names', `letter sounds', and math codes
include `counting', `sorting'. We pose this as a fine-grained multilabel
classification problem as videos can contain multiple types of educational
content and the content classes can get visually similar (e.g., `letter names'
vs `letter sounds'). We propose a novel class prototypes based supervised
contrastive learning approach that can handle fine-grained samples associated
with multiple labels. We learn a class prototype for each class and a loss
function is employed to minimize the distances between a class prototype and
the samples from the class. Similarly, distances between a class prototype and
the samples from other classes are maximized. As the alignment between visual
and audio cues are crucial for effective comprehension, we consider a
multimodal transformer network to capture the interaction between visual and
audio cues in videos while learning the embedding for videos. For evaluation,
we present a dataset, APPROVE, employing educational videos from YouTube
labeled with fine-grained education classes by education researchers. APPROVE
consists of 193 hours of expert-annotated videos with 19 classes. The proposed
approach outperforms strong baselines on APPROVE and other benchmarks such as
Youtube-8M, and COIN. The dataset is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究证明仅通过面部表情的动态成分就能识别个人身份，无需依赖静态面部特征。使用FLAME 3D模型分离面部形状和表情动态，在1,429人的对话视频数据集上达到61.14%的识别准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索面部表情动态是否包含足够强的身份特征，独立于静态面部外观，这对于理解社交感知和临床评估具有重要意义。

Method: 使用FLAME 3D可变形模型分离面部形状和表情动态参数，仅保留表情和下颌系数。采用Conformer模型和监督对比学习进行1,429路分类。引入漂移噪声比(DNR)量化形状-表情分离的可靠性。

Result: 在CANDOR数据集的1,429名说话者上达到61.14%的识别准确率，比随机猜测高458倍。DNR与识别性能呈强负相关，证实不稳定的形状估计会损害动态识别。

Conclusion: 面部动态携带强烈的个人身份特征，在自然对话中具有特异性。形状-表情分离的可靠性对识别性能至关重要，这对社交感知和临床评估有重要启示。

Abstract: This work investigates whether individuals can be identified solely through
the pure dynamical components of their facial expressions, independent of
static facial appearance. We leverage the FLAME 3D morphable model to achieve
explicit disentanglement between facial shape and expression dynamics,
extracting frame-by-frame parameters from conversational videos while retaining
only expression and jaw coefficients. On the CANDOR dataset of 1,429 speakers
in naturalistic conversations, our Conformer model with supervised contrastive
learning achieves 61.14\%accuracy on 1,429-way classification -- 458 times
above chance -- demonstrating that facial dynamics carry strong identity
signatures. We introduce a drift-to-noise ratio (DNR) that quantifies the
reliability of shape expression separation by measuring across-session shape
changes relative to within-session variability. DNR strongly negatively
correlates with recognition performance, confirming that unstable shape
estimation compromises dynamic identification. Our findings reveal
person-specific signatures in conversational facial dynamics, with implications
for social perception and clinical assessment.

Abstract: Effective pneumonia diagnosis is often challenged by the difficulty of
deploying large, computationally expensive deep learning models in
resource-limited settings. This study introduces LightPneumoNet, an efficient,
lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) built from scratch to provide an
accessible and accurate diagnostic solution for pneumonia detection from chest
X-rays. Our model was trained on a public dataset of 5,856 chest X-ray images.
Preprocessing included image resizing to 224x224, grayscale conversion, and
pixel normalization, with data augmentation (rotation, zoom, shear) to prevent
overfitting. The custom architecture features four blocks of stacked
convolutional layers and contains only 388,082 trainable parameters, resulting
in a minimal 1.48 MB memory footprint. On the independent test set, our model
delivered exceptional performance, achieving an overall accuracy of 0.942,
precision of 0.92, and an F1-Score of 0.96. Critically, it obtained a
sensitivity (recall) of 0.99, demonstrating a near-perfect ability to identify
true pneumonia cases and minimize clinically significant false negatives.
Notably, LightPneumoNet achieves this high recall on the same dataset where
existing approaches typically require significantly heavier architectures or
fail to reach comparable sensitivity levels. The model's efficiency enables
deployment on low-cost hardware, making advanced computer-aided diagnosis
accessible in underserved clinics and serving as a reliable second-opinion tool
to improve patient outcomes.

Conclusion: DTEA模型通过改进的跳跃连接框架有效提升了医学图像分割的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: In medical image segmentation, skip connections are used to merge global
context and reduce the semantic gap between encoder and decoder. Current
methods often struggle with limited structural representation and insufficient
contextual modeling, affecting generalization in complex clinical scenarios. We
propose the DTEA model, featuring a new skip connection framework with the
Semantic Topology Reconfiguration (STR) and Entropic Perturbation Gating (EPG)
modules. STR reorganizes multi-scale semantic features into a dynamic
hypergraph to better model cross-resolution anatomical dependencies, enhancing
structural and semantic representation. EPG assesses channel stability after
perturbation and filters high-entropy channels to emphasize clinically
important regions and improve spatial attention. Extensive experiments on three
benchmark datasets show our framework achieves superior segmentation accuracy
and better generalization across various clinical settings. The code is

Conclusion: 基于LLM代理的自动化方法显著提高了SEM图像中尺度条检测和提取的效率和准确性，为显微分析和科学成像领域提供了有价值的工具。

Abstract: Microscopic characterizations, such as Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM),
are widely used in scientific research for visualizing and analyzing
microstructures. Determining the scale bars is an important first step of
accurate SEM analysis; however, currently, it mainly relies on manual
operations, which is both time-consuming and prone to errors. To address this
issue, we propose a multi-modal and automated scale bar detection and
extraction framework that provides concurrent object detection, text detection
and text recognition with a Large Language Model (LLM) agent. The proposed
framework operates in four phases; i) Automatic Dataset Generation (Auto-DG)
model to synthesize a diverse dataset of SEM images ensuring robust training
and high generalizability of the model, ii) scale bar object detection, iii)
information extraction using a hybrid Optical Character Recognition (OCR)
system with DenseNet and Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN) based
algorithms, iv) an LLM agent to analyze and verify accuracy of the results. The
proposed model demonstrates a strong performance in object detection and
accurate localization with a precision of 100%, recall of 95.8%, and a mean
Average Precision (mAP) of 99.2% at IoU=0.5 and 69.1% at IoU=0.5:0.95. The
hybrid OCR system achieved 89% precision, 65% recall, and a 75% F1 score on the
Auto-DG dataset, significantly outperforming several mainstream standalone
engines, highlighting its reliability for scientific image analysis. The LLM is
introduced as a reasoning engine as well as an intelligent assistant that
suggests follow-up steps and verifies the results. This automated method
powered by an LLM agent significantly enhances the efficiency and accuracy of
scale bar detection and extraction in SEM images, providing a valuable tool for
microscopic analysis and advancing the field of scientific imaging.

TL;DR: 提出了Class Vectors方法，通过在潜在空间中捕获类别特定的表示调整，实现图像分类器的灵活编辑，包括遗忘特定类别、适应分布变化等应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分类器编辑方法要么局限于错误修正，要么需要大量重新训练成本，难以实现灵活编辑，特别是在图像分类领域缺乏有效解决方案。

Method: 引入Class Vectors概念，在微调过程中捕获类别特定的表示调整。与任务向量在权重空间编码任务级变化不同，Class Vectors在潜在空间中解耦每个类别的适应过程。

Result: Class Vectors能够捕获每个类别的语义偏移，通过沿这些向量引导潜在特征或将其映射到权重空间来更新决策边界，实现分类器编辑。其固有的线性和正交性支持通过简单的类别算术进行高效编辑。

Conclusion: Class Vectors为图像分类器提供了灵活、高效的编辑能力，在遗忘学习、环境适应、对抗防御和对抗触发器优化等应用中验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Image classifiers play a critical role in detecting diseases in medical
imaging and identifying anomalies in manufacturing processes. However, their
predefined behaviors after extensive training make post hoc model editing
difficult, especially when it comes to forgetting specific classes or adapting
to distribution shifts. Existing classifier editing methods either focus
narrowly on correcting errors or incur extensive retraining costs, creating a
bottleneck for flexible editing. Moreover, such editing has seen limited
investigation in image classification. To overcome these challenges, we
introduce Class Vectors, which capture class-specific representation
adjustments during fine-tuning. Whereas task vectors encode task-level changes
in weight space, Class Vectors disentangle each class's adaptation in the
latent space. We show that Class Vectors capture each class's semantic shift
and that classifier editing can be achieved either by steering latent features
along these vectors or by mapping them into weight space to update the decision
boundaries. We also demonstrate that the inherent linearity and orthogonality
of Class Vectors support efficient, flexible, and high-level concept editing
via simple class arithmetic. Finally, we validate their utility in applications
such as unlearning, environmental adaptation, adversarial defense, and
adversarial trigger optimization.

TL;DR: HaDola是一个人类不确定性感知的数据选择和自动标注框架，通过四个阶段迭代识别有害样本、优先选择信息丰富的样本，并使用少量种子数据（5%数据）进行引导，显著减少对昂贵人工标注的依赖，使视觉语言模型更准确且校准更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界数据集常存在人类不确定性（HU）——人类标注信心的变化，但标准监督微调（SFT）仅优化最频繁标签，忽略了HU分布。这留下两个开放问题：HU如何影响SFT，以及如何在训练中有效利用HU。

Method: HaDola框架包含四个阶段：区分、自标注、错误触发和训练，通过迭代识别有害样本、优先选择信息丰富样本，并使用少量种子数据进行引导。

Result: 在VQAv2和VizWiz数据集上的广泛实验表明，HaDola使用更少的训练数据，始终匹配或优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在SFT中显式建模HU的重要性，表明更好地利用HU比单纯扩大数据集规模更有效。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) achieve strong performance in Visual
Question Answering but still rely heavily on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with
massive labeled datasets, which is costly due to human annotations. Crucially,
real-world datasets often exhibit human uncertainty (HU) -- variation in human
confidence across annotations -- but standard SFT simply optimizes toward the
most frequent label, disregarding HU distributions. This leaves two open
questions: How does HU affect SFT, and how can HU be effectively leveraged in
training? In this work, we first conduct a systematic evaluation of VLMs across
varying HU levels. We have two key findings: (i) surprisingly, high-HU samples
contribute little or even degrade model performance, and (ii) naively training
on the full dataset yields under-calibrated models that fail to capture HU
distributions. Motivated by these findings, we introduce HaDola, a human
uncertainty-aware data selection and automatic labeling framework. HaDola
operates in four stages -- discriminate, self-annotate, error trigger, and
training -- to iteratively identify harmful samples, prioritize informative
ones, and bootstrap from a small seed set (5\% of data). Our approach
substantially reduces reliance on costly HU annotations and makes VLMs more
accurate and better calibrated. Extensive experiments on VQAv2 and VizWiz
datasets demonstrate that HaDola consistently matches or outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines with less training data. Our work highlights the
importance of explicitly modeling HU in SFT, suggesting that better utilization
of HU is more effective than merely scaling up dataset size.

TL;DR: 提出了ΔEnergy OOD检测分数，通过最大化其下界(EBM)同时提升OOD检测和泛化能力，在多个基准测试中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中视觉语言模型(VLMs)会遇到分布内(ID)和分布外(OOD)数据，包括协变量偏移和语义偏移。需要同时提升对协变量偏移OOD数据的泛化能力，并有效检测开放集语义偏移OOD类别。

Method: 基于视觉语言模态重新对齐时闭集数据能量显著变化的观察，提出ΔEnergy OOD分数，并通过下界最大化(EBM)优化该分数，理论上证明能同时提升OOD检测和泛化能力。

Result: 在具有挑战性的OOD检测和泛化基准测试中，相比现有方法在AUROC指标上提升10%到25%。

Conclusion: ΔEnergy和EBM提供了一个统一的微调框架，能同时增强VLMs在OOD泛化和OOD检测方面的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Recent approaches for vision-language models (VLMs) have shown remarkable
success in achieving fast downstream adaptation. When applied to real-world
downstream tasks, VLMs inevitably encounter both the in-distribution (ID) data
and out-of-distribution (OOD) data. The OOD datasets often include both
covariate shifts (e.g., known classes with changes in image styles) and
semantic shifts (e.g., test-time unseen classes). This highlights the
importance of improving VLMs' generalization ability to covariate-shifted OOD
data, while effectively detecting open-set semantic-shifted OOD classes. In
this paper, inspired by the substantial energy change observed in closed-set
data when re-aligning vision-language modalities (specifically by directly
reducing the maximum cosine similarity to a low value), we introduce a novel
OOD score, named {\Delta}Energy. {\Delta}Energy significantly outperforms the
vanilla energy-based OOD score and provides a more reliable approach for OOD
detection. Furthermore, {\Delta}Energy can simultaneously improve OOD
generalization under covariate shifts, which is achieved by lower-bound
maximization for {\Delta}Energy (termed EBM). EBM is theoretically proven to
not only enhance OOD detection but also yields a domain-consistent Hessian,
which serves as a strong indicator for OOD generalization. Based on this
finding, we developed a unified fine-tuning framework that allows for improving
VLMs' robustness in both OOD generalization and OOD detection. Extensive
experiments on challenging OOD detection and generalization benchmarks
demonstrate the superiority of our method, outperforming recent approaches by
10% to 25% in AUROC.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统监督检测需要大量标注投入，而零样本VLM无需标注但准确率较低，需要系统比较两者的成本效益。

Method: 在1,000张分层COCO图像和200张多样化产品图像上进行系统评估，结合详细的总拥有成本建模，分析准确率和成本指标。

Result: 监督YOLO准确率91.2% vs 零样本Gemini 68.5%，但Gemini在未训练类别上表现更好(52.3% vs 0%)，且每正确检测成本更低($0.00050 vs $0.143)。

Conclusion: 最优架构选择取决于部署量、类别稳定性、预算约束和准确率要求，而非纯粹技术性能指标。

Abstract: Object detection systems have traditionally relied on supervised learning
with manually annotated bounding boxes, achieving high accuracy at the cost of
substantial annotation investment. The emergence of Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) offers an alternative paradigm enabling zero-shot detection through
natural language queries, eliminating annotation requirements but operating
with reduced accuracy. This paper presents the first comprehensive
cost-effectiveness analysis comparing supervised detection (YOLO) with
zero-shot VLM inference (Gemini Flash 2.5). Through systematic evaluation on
1,000 stratified COCO images and 200 diverse product images spanning consumer
electronics and rare categories, combined with detailed Total Cost of Ownership
modeling, we establish quantitative break-even thresholds governing
architecture selection. Our findings reveal that supervised YOLO achieves 91.2%
accuracy versus 68.5% for zero-shot Gemini on standard categories, representing
a 22.7 percentage point advantage that costs $10,800 in annotation for
100-category systems. However, this advantage justifies investment only beyond
55 million inferences, equivalent to 151,000 images daily for one year.
Zero-shot Gemini demonstrates 52.3% accuracy on diverse product categories
(ranging from highly web-prevalent consumer electronics at 75-85% to rare
specialized equipment at 25-40%) where supervised YOLO achieves 0% due to
architectural constraints preventing detection of untrained classes. Cost per
Correct Detection analysis reveals substantially lower per-detection costs for
Gemini ($0.00050 vs $0.143) at 100,000 inferences despite accuracy deficits. We
develop decision frameworks demonstrating that optimal architecture selection
depends critically on deployment volume, category stability, budget
constraints, and accuracy requirements rather than purely technical performance
metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于草图的3D重建挑战，因为草图输入抽象稀疏，缺乏足够的语义和几何信息。

Method: 两阶段生成方法：1) 通过草图到图像翻译进行语义桥接，丰富稀疏草图表示；2) 引入对称约束作为几何先验，利用日常物体的结构规律性。

Result: 在主流草图数据集上的实验表明，该方法在Chamfer距离、Earth Mover距离和F-Score方面优于现有基于草图的3D重建方法。

Conclusion: 验证了所提出的语义桥接和对称感知设计的有效性。

Abstract: Sketch-based 3D reconstruction remains a challenging task due to the abstract
and sparse nature of sketch inputs, which often lack sufficient semantic and
geometric information. To address this, we propose Sketch2Symm, a two-stage
generation method that produces geometrically consistent 3D shapes from
sketches. Our approach introduces semantic bridging via sketch-to-image
translation to enrich sparse sketch representations, and incorporates symmetry
constraints as geometric priors to leverage the structural regularity commonly
found in everyday objects. Experiments on mainstream sketch datasets
demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance compared to existing
sketch-based reconstruction methods in terms of Chamfer Distance, Earth Mover's
Distance, and F-Score, verifying the effectiveness of the proposed semantic
bridging and symmetry-aware design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 洪水制图和水深估计对校准和验证水力模型至关重要，但SAR影像处理中不同方法和参数选择的影响尚未系统研究。

Method: 使用SAR影像评估多种预处理（特别是斑点噪声抑制）、洪水制图和水深估计方法，考虑预处理图像、洪水图和水深场的集成，以法国加龙河2019和2021年两次洪水事件为案例。

Result: 斑点滤波器的选择会改变洪水范围估计达数平方公里；监督方法优于无监督方法，但调优后的无监督方法（如局部阈值或变化检测）可达到相当结果；预处理和洪水制图步骤的累积不确定性导致水深估计高度可变。

Conclusion: 必须考虑整个处理流程（预处理、洪水制图和水深估计）及其相关参数，优先采用集成方法并考虑方法不确定性；洪水制图中方法选择影响最大，水深估计中最有影响的是洪水制图步骤产生的洪水图输入和方法参数。

Abstract: Flood mapping and water depth estimation from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)
imagery are crucial for calibrating and validating hydraulic models. This study
uses SAR imagery to evaluate various preprocessing (especially speckle noise
reduction), flood mapping, and water depth estimation methods. The impact of
the choice of method at different steps and its hyperparameters is studied by
considering an ensemble of preprocessed images, flood maps, and water depth
fields. The evaluation is conducted for two flood events on the Garonne River
(France) in 2019 and 2021, using hydrodynamic simulations and in-situ
observations as reference data. Results show that the choice of speckle filter
alters flood extent estimations with variations of several square kilometers.
Furthermore, the selection and tuning of flood mapping methods also affect
performance. While supervised methods outperformed unsupervised ones, tuned
unsupervised approaches (such as local thresholding or change detection) can
achieve comparable results. The compounded uncertainty from preprocessing and
flood mapping steps also introduces high variability in the water depth field
estimates. This study highlights the importance of considering the entire
processing pipeline, encompassing preprocessing, flood mapping, and water depth
estimation methods and their associated hyperparameters. Rather than relying on
a single configuration, adopting an ensemble approach and accounting for
methodological uncertainty should be privileged. For flood mapping, the method
choice has the most influence. For water depth estimation, the most influential
processing step was the flood map input resulting from the flood mapping step
and the hyperparameters of the methods.

TL;DR: 提出了InternSVG系列，这是一个集成的数据-基准-模型套件，通过多模态大语言模型实现SVG的统一建模，包括理解、编辑和生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决SVG建模面临的挑战：数据集碎片化、方法跨任务迁移性有限、处理结构复杂性困难。

Method: 构建SAgoge数据集和SArena基准，提出InternSVG统一模型，采用SVG特定特殊标记、基于子词的嵌入初始化和两阶段训练策略。

Result: 在SArena和先前基准测试中，InternSVG实现了显著性能提升，持续优于领先的开源和专有模型。

Conclusion: 通过统一建模方法实现了SVG理解、编辑和生成的正向迁移和整体性能提升。

Abstract: General SVG modeling remains challenging due to fragmented datasets, limited
transferability of methods across tasks, and the difficulty of handling
structural complexity. In response, we leverage the strong transfer and
generalization capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to
achieve unified modeling for SVG understanding, editing, and generation. We
present the InternSVG family, an integrated data-benchmark-model suite. At its
core is SAgoge, the largest and most comprehensive multimodal dataset for SVG
tasks, encompassing both static graphics and dynamic animations. It covers
icons, long-sequence illustrations, scientific diagrams, and dynamic
animations, supporting tasks of varied difficulty levels and providing deeper
hierarchies with richer attributes compared to previous datasets. Based on this
resource, we introduce SArena, a companion benchmark with comprehensive task
definitions and standardized evaluation that aligns with the domains and
difficulty spectrum covered by SAgoge. Building on these foundations, we
propose InternSVG, a unified MLLM for SVG understanding, editing, and
generation with SVG-specific special tokens, subword-based embedding
initialization, and a two-stage training strategy that progresses from short
static SVGs to long-sequence illustrations and complex animations. This unified
formulation induces positive transfer and improves overall performance.
Experiments on SArena and prior benchmark confirm that InternSVG achieves
substantial gains and consistently outperforms leading open and proprietary
counterparts.

TL;DR: 提出了MMAP框架，通过多放大倍率特征提取和原型嵌入学习，显著提升了从H&E染色图像预测空间基因表达的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 空间转录组学结合组织学图像预测基因表达存在模态差异大、局部特征粒度不足和全局空间上下文覆盖不充分的问题。

Method: MMAP框架采用多放大倍率补丁表示捕获细粒度组织学特征，并学习潜在原型嵌入作为切片级信息的紧凑表示。

Result: 在多个评估指标（MAE、MSE、PCC）上，MMAP均优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: MMAP通过同时增强局部特征粒度和全局上下文理解，有效解决了空间基因表达预测的关键挑战。

Abstract: Spatial Transcriptomics (ST) enables the measurement of gene expression while
preserving spatial information, offering critical insights into tissue
architecture and disease pathology. Recent developments have explored the use
of hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained whole-slide images (WSIs) to predict
transcriptome-wide gene expression profiles through deep neural networks. This
task is commonly framed as a regression problem, where each input corresponds
to a localized image patch extracted from the WSI. However, predicting spatial
gene expression from histological images remains a challenging problem due to
the significant modality gap between visual features and molecular signals.
Recent studies have attempted to incorporate both local and global information
into predictive models. Nevertheless, existing methods still suffer from two
key limitations: (1) insufficient granularity in local feature extraction, and
(2) inadequate coverage of global spatial context. In this work, we propose a
novel framework, MMAP (Multi-MAgnification and Prototype-enhanced
architecture), that addresses both challenges simultaneously. To enhance local
feature granularity, MMAP leverages multi-magnification patch representations
that capture fine-grained histological details. To improve global contextual
understanding, it learns a set of latent prototype embeddings that serve as
compact representations of slide-level information. Extensive experimental
results demonstrate that MMAP consistently outperforms all existing
state-of-the-art methods across multiple evaluation metrics, including Mean
Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Pearson Correlation
Coefficient (PCC).

TL;DR: 提出一种通过引入不确定性控制机制，利用未标记域数据训练ControlNet的方法，生成具有高不确定性的标注数据，显著改善跨域分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ControlNet倾向于复制原始训练分布，限制了数据增强效果。需要利用未标记域数据来扩展模型能力，特别是在存在大域偏移的场景中。

Method: 在控制机制中引入不确定性概念，结合来自未标记数据集的不确定性控制和来自标记数据集的语义控制，生成目标域的高不确定性标注数据。

Result: 在视网膜OCT和交通场景实验中，该方法显著改善了跨域分割结果，无需额外监督就能有效处理域偏移问题。

Conclusion: 不确定性引导方法优于风格迁移，能够实现任意域偏移而无需严格学习图像风格，为跨域分割提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Generative Models are a valuable tool for the controlled creation of
high-quality image data. Controlled diffusion models like the ControlNet have
allowed the creation of labeled distributions. Such synthetic datasets can
augment the original training distribution when discriminative models, like
semantic segmentation, are trained. However, this augmentation effect is
limited since ControlNets tend to reproduce the original training distribution.
  This work introduces a method to utilize data from unlabeled domains to train
ControlNets by introducing the concept of uncertainty into the control
mechanism. The uncertainty indicates that a given image was not part of the
training distribution of a downstream task, e.g., segmentation. Thus, two types
of control are engaged in the final network: an uncertainty control from an
unlabeled dataset and a semantic control from the labeled dataset. The
resulting ControlNet allows us to create annotated data with high uncertainty
from the target domain, i.e., synthetic data from the unlabeled distribution
with labels. In our scenario, we consider retinal OCTs, where typically
high-quality Spectralis images are available with given ground truth
segmentations, enabling the training of segmentation networks. The recent
development in Home-OCT devices, however, yields retinal OCTs with lower
quality and a large domain shift, such that out-of-the-pocket segmentation
networks cannot be applied for this type of data. Synthesizing annotated images
from the Home-OCT domain using the proposed approach closes this gap and leads
to significantly improved segmentation results without adding any further
supervision. The advantage of uncertainty-guidance becomes obvious when
compared to style transfer: it enables arbitrary domain shifts without any
strict learning of an image style. This is also demonstrated in a traffic scene
experiment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于推理的IQA模型虽然泛化能力强，但其推理能耗和延迟远高于传统模型，限制了实际部署。同时，这些模型泛化能力的根本机制尚未被充分探索。

Method: 提出RALI算法，使用对比学习直接对齐图像与通过强化学习学到的可泛化文本表示，无需推理过程甚至无需加载大语言模型。

Result: RALI在质量评分任务上实现了与基于推理模型相当的泛化性能，同时仅需不到5%的模型参数和推理时间。

Conclusion: 通过将推理过程转化为表示对齐，RALI成功解决了推理基IQA模型的高计算成本问题，为高效可泛化的图像质量评估提供了新思路。

Abstract: Reasoning-based image quality assessment (IQA) models trained through
reinforcement learning (RL) exhibit exceptional generalization, yet the
underlying mechanisms and critical factors driving this capability remain
underexplored in current research. Moreover, despite their superior
performance, these models incur inference energy usage and latency orders of
magnitude higher than their earlier counterparts, restricting their deployment
in specific scenarios. Through extensive experiments, this paper verifies and
elaborates that through RL training, MLLMs leverage their reasoning capability
to convert redundant visual representations into compact, cross-domain aligned
text representations. This conversion is precisely the source of the
generalization exhibited by these reasoning-based IQA models. Building on this
fundamental insight, we propose a novel algorithm, RALI, which employs
contrastive learning to directly align images with these generalizable text
representations learned by RL. This approach eliminates the reliance on
reasoning processes and even obviates the need to load an LLM. For the quality
scoring task, this framework achieves generalization performance comparable to
reasoning-based models while requiring less than 5% of their model parameters
and inference time.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于多视角一致性的高斯泼溅反射建模方法，通过多视角一致材质推断和基于物理的环境建模来准确学习反射效果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在材质推断时缺乏足够约束，特别是在有限环境建模下，导致光照混叠和泛化能力下降

Method: 强制2D高斯在多视角下产生一致材质图；通过跟踪视角间光度变化识别高反射区域作为反射强度先验；引入基于2DGS光线追踪的环境建模策略处理间接光照

Result: 在广泛使用的基准测试中，方法能忠实恢复光照和几何，在新视角合成中达到最先进的渲染质量

Conclusion: 多视角一致材质推断与物理基础环境建模是高斯泼溅中学习准确反射的关键

Abstract: Modeling reflections from 2D images is essential for photorealistic rendering
and novel view synthesis. Recent approaches enhance Gaussian primitives with
reflection-related material attributes to enable physically based rendering
(PBR) with Gaussian Splatting. However, the material inference often lacks
sufficient constraints, especially under limited environment modeling,
resulting in illumination aliasing and reduced generalization. In this work, we
revisit the problem from a multi-view perspective and show that multi-view
consistent material inference with more physically-based environment modeling
is key to learning accurate reflections with Gaussian Splatting. To this end,
we enforce 2D Gaussians to produce multi-view consistent material maps during
deferred shading. We also track photometric variations across views to identify
highly reflective regions, which serve as strong priors for reflection strength
terms. To handle indirect illumination caused by inter-object occlusions, we
further introduce an environment modeling strategy through ray tracing with
2DGS, enabling photorealistic rendering of indirect radiance. Experiments on
widely used benchmarks show that our method faithfully recovers both
illumination and geometry, achieving state-of-the-art rendering quality in
novel views synthesis.

TL;DR: 提出了DocReward文档奖励模型，专注于评估文档的结构和样式质量，解决了现有代理工作流只关注文本质量而忽略视觉结构和样式的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的代理工作流主要关注文本质量，而忽略了视觉结构和样式对文档可读性和吸引力的重要性，这主要是由于缺乏合适的奖励模型来指导生成具有更好结构和样式的文档。

Method: 构建了包含117K对文档的多领域数据集DocPair，涵盖32个领域和267种文档类型，每对文档内容相同但结构和样式不同。使用Bradley-Terry损失训练DocReward模型来评分文档。

Result: DocReward在准确性上分别比GPT-4o和GPT-5高出30.6和19.4个百分点。在文档生成的外在评估中，DocReward获得了60.8%的胜率，显著高于GPT-5的37.7%。

Conclusion: DocReward模型在评估文档结构和样式质量方面表现出色，能够有效指导生成代理产生更符合人类偏好的文档，解决了现有方法在视觉结构和样式评估方面的不足。

Abstract: Recent advances in agentic workflows have enabled the automation of tasks
such as professional document generation. However, they primarily focus on
textual quality, neglecting visual structure and style, which are crucial for
readability and engagement. This gap arises mainly from the absence of suitable
reward models to guide agentic workflows toward producing documents with
stronger structural and stylistic quality. To address this, we propose
DocReward, a document reward model that evaluates documents based on their
structure and style. We construct a multi-domain dataset DocPair of 117K paired
documents, covering 32 domains and 267 document types, each including a high-
and low-professionalism document with identical content but different structure
and style. This enables the model to evaluate professionalism comprehensively,
and in a textual-quality-agnostic way. DocReward is trained using the
Bradley-Terry loss to score documents, penalizing predictions that contradict
the annotated ranking. To assess the performance of reward models, we create a
test dataset containing document bundles ranked by well-educated human
evaluators. Notably, DocReward outperforms GPT-4o and GPT-5 in accuracy by 30.6
and 19.4 percentage points, respectively, demonstrating its superiority over
baselines. In an extrinsic evaluation of document generation, DocReward
achieves a significantly higher win rate of 60.8%, compared to GPT-5's 37.7%
win rate, demonstrating its utility in guiding generation agents toward
producing human-preferred documents.

Conclusion: LM-EEC框架通过有效的特征融合和长期记忆机制，成功解决了自我-外部视角对应任务中的关键挑战，为智能助手提供精确直观的视觉指导。

Abstract: Establishing object-level correspondence between egocentric and exocentric
views is essential for intelligent assistants to deliver precise and intuitive
visual guidance. However, this task faces numerous challenges, including
extreme viewpoint variations, occlusions, and the presence of small objects.
Existing approaches usually borrow solutions from video object segmentation
models, but still suffer from the aforementioned challenges. Recently, the
Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2) has shown strong generalization capabilities
and excellent performance in video object segmentation. Yet, when simply
applied to the ego-exo correspondence (EEC) task, SAM 2 encounters severe
difficulties due to ineffective ego-exo feature fusion and limited long-term
memory capacity, especially for long videos. Addressing these problems, we
propose a novel EEC framework based on SAM 2 with long-term memories by
presenting a dual-memory architecture and an adaptive feature routing module
inspired by Mixture-of-Experts (MoE). Compared to SAM 2, our approach features
(i) a Memory-View MoE module which consists of a dual-branch routing mechanism
to adaptively assign contribution weights to each expert feature along both
channel and spatial dimensions, and (ii) a dual-memory bank system with a
simple yet effective compression strategy to retain critical long-term
information while eliminating redundancy. In the extensive experiments on the
challenging EgoExo4D benchmark, our method, dubbed LM-EEC, achieves new
state-of-the-art results and significantly outperforms existing methods and the
SAM 2 baseline, showcasing its strong generalization across diverse scenarios.

Abstract: Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) for inland waterways remains challenged by
cooperative system vulnerabilities. This paper presents a novel framework that
fuses high-resolution satellite imagery with vessel trajectory data from the
Automatic Identification System (AIS). This work addresses the limitations of
AIS-based monitoring by leveraging non-cooperative satellite imagery and
implementing a fusion approach that links visual detections with AIS data to
identify dark vessels, validate cooperative traffic, and support advanced MDA.
The You Only Look Once (YOLO) v11 object detection model is used to detect and
characterize vessels and barges by vessel type, barge cover, operational
status, barge count, and direction of travel. An annotated data set of 4,550
instances was developed from $5{,}973~\mathrm{mi}^2$ of Lower Mississippi River
imagery. Evaluation on a held-out test set demonstrated vessel classification
(tugboat, crane barge, bulk carrier, cargo ship, and hopper barge) with an F1
score of 95.8\%; barge cover (covered or uncovered) detection yielded an F1
score of 91.6\%; operational status (staged or in motion) classification
reached an F1 score of 99.4\%. Directionality (upstream, downstream) yielded
93.8\% accuracy. The barge count estimation resulted in a mean absolute error
(MAE) of 2.4 barges. Spatial transferability analysis across geographically
disjoint river segments showed accuracy was maintained as high as 98\%. These
results underscore the viability of integrating non-cooperative satellite
sensing with AIS fusion. This approach enables near-real-time fleet
inventories, supports anomaly detection, and generates high-quality data for
inland waterway surveillance. Future work will expand annotated datasets,
incorporate temporal tracking, and explore multi-modal deep learning to further
enhance operational scalability.

Conclusion: 该方法成功将退化建模与融合过程耦合，利用VLM实现退化感知和引导抑制，在退化图像融合任务中表现出色

Abstract: Existing Infrared and Visible Image Fusion (IVIF) methods typically assume
high-quality inputs. However, when handing degraded images, these methods
heavily rely on manually switching between different pre-processing techniques.
This decoupling of degradation handling and image fusion leads to significant
performance degradation. In this paper, we propose a novel VLM-Guided
Degradation-Coupled Fusion network (VGDCFusion), which tightly couples
degradation modeling with the fusion process and leverages vision-language
models (VLMs) for degradation-aware perception and guided suppression.
Specifically, the proposed Specific-Prompt Degradation-Coupled Extractor
(SPDCE) enables modality-specific degradation awareness and establishes a joint
modeling of degradation suppression and intra-modal feature extraction. In
parallel, the Joint-Prompt Degradation-Coupled Fusion (JPDCF) facilitates
cross-modal degradation perception and couples residual degradation filtering
with complementary cross-modal feature fusion. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our VGDCFusion significantly outperforms existing
state-of-the-art fusion approaches under various degraded image scenarios. Our
code is available at https://github.com/Lmmh058/VGDCFusion.

Motivation: 3D高斯泼溅虽然在新视角合成方面表现出色，但其表面重建能力尚未充分探索。由于高斯函数的离散和非结构化特性，仅基于图像渲染损失的监督往往导致几何不准确和多视图对齐不一致的问题。

Method: 1) 将边缘感知图像线索融入渲染损失以改善表面边界描绘；2) 引入可见性感知光度对齐损失来建模遮挡并鼓励高斯之间的准确空间关系；3) 结合法向量约束来细化高斯空间方向并改进局部表面估计；4) 利用深度图像特征嵌入来增强跨视图一致性。

Result: 在标准基准测试上的广泛实验表明，该方法在表面重建和新视角合成方面都达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 通过视图对齐方法显著增强了3D高斯泼溅的几何表示能力，在保持高效实时渲染的同时，实现了更准确的表面重建结果。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting has recently emerged as an efficient solution for
high-quality and real-time novel view synthesis. However, its capability for
accurate surface reconstruction remains underexplored. Due to the discrete and
unstructured nature of Gaussians, supervision based solely on image rendering
loss often leads to inaccurate geometry and inconsistent multi-view alignment.
In this work, we propose a novel method that enhances the geometric
representation of 3D Gaussians through view alignment (VA). Specifically, we
incorporate edge-aware image cues into the rendering loss to improve surface
boundary delineation. To enforce geometric consistency across views, we
introduce a visibility-aware photometric alignment loss that models occlusions
and encourages accurate spatial relationships among Gaussians. To further
mitigate ambiguities caused by lighting variations, we incorporate normal-based
constraints to refine the spatial orientation of Gaussians and improve local
surface estimation. Additionally, we leverage deep image feature embeddings to
enforce cross-view consistency, enhancing the robustness of the learned
geometry under varying viewpoints and illumination. Extensive experiments on
standard benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance in both surface reconstruction and novel view synthesis. The source

Abstract: Surface normal integration is a fundamental problem in computer vision,
dealing with the objective of reconstructing a surface from its corresponding
normal map. Existing approaches require an iterative global optimization to
jointly estimate the depth of each pixel, which scales poorly to larger normal
maps. In this paper, we address this problem by recasting normal integration as
the estimation of relative scales of continuous components. By constraining
pixels belonging to the same component to jointly vary their scale, we
drastically reduce the number of optimization variables. Our framework includes
a heuristic to accurately estimate continuous components from the start, a
strategy to rebalance optimization terms, and a technique to iteratively merge
components to further reduce the size of the problem. Our method achieves
state-of-the-art results on the standard normal integration benchmark in as
little as a few seconds and achieves one-order-of-magnitude speedup over
pixel-level approaches on large-resolution normal maps.

TL;DR: Situat3DChange是一个大规模3D数据集，支持三种情境感知变化理解任务，包含121K问答对、36K变化描述和17K重排指令。通过11K人类环境变化观察构建共享心智模型，提出SCReasoner方法进行高效点云比较。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前3D数据集和评估基准往往孤立处理动态场景或动态情境，导致理解不完整。为了克服这些限制，需要构建支持情境感知变化理解的综合数据集。

Method: 利用11K人类环境变化观察构建共享心智模型，整合自我中心和他者中心视角以及分类和坐标空间关系。提出SCReasoner方法，一种高效的3D多模态大语言模型方法，实现有效的点云比较，参数开销最小且无需语言解码器的额外token。

Result: 在Situat3DChange任务上的综合评估突显了MLLMs在动态场景和情境理解方面的进展和局限性。数据缩放和跨域迁移的额外实验证明了使用Situat3DChange作为MLLMs训练数据集的任务无关有效性。

Conclusion: Situat3DChange为动态环境中的情境感知变化理解提供了全面的数据集和基准，SCReasoner方法在点云比较方面表现出高效性，为人类-AI协作中的共享情境意识奠定了基础。

Abstract: Physical environments and circumstances are fundamentally dynamic, yet
current 3D datasets and evaluation benchmarks tend to concentrate on either
dynamic scenarios or dynamic situations in isolation, resulting in incomplete
comprehension. To overcome these constraints, we introduce Situat3DChange, an
extensive dataset supporting three situation-aware change understanding tasks
following the perception-action model: 121K question-answer pairs, 36K change
descriptions for perception tasks, and 17K rearrangement instructions for the
action task. To construct this large-scale dataset, Situat3DChange leverages
11K human observations of environmental changes to establish shared mental
models and shared situational awareness for human-AI collaboration. These
observations, enriched with egocentric and allocentric perspectives as well as
categorical and coordinate spatial relations, are integrated using an LLM to
support understanding of situated changes. To address the challenge of
comparing pairs of point clouds from the same scene with minor changes, we
propose SCReasoner, an efficient 3D MLLM approach that enables effective point
cloud comparison with minimal parameter overhead and no additional tokens
required for the language decoder. Comprehensive evaluation on Situat3DChange
tasks highlights both the progress and limitations of MLLMs in dynamic scene
and situation understanding. Additional experiments on data scaling and
cross-domain transfer demonstrate the task-agnostic effectiveness of using
Situat3DChange as a training dataset for MLLMs.

TL;DR: LikePhys是一种无需训练的方法，通过使用去噪目标作为ELBO似然替代来评估视频扩散模型中的直觉物理理解，在12个物理场景的基准测试中表现出与人类偏好强对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 构建通用的物理合理世界模拟器需要视频扩散模型具备直觉物理理解能力，但由于难以从生成中分离物理正确性和视觉外观，准确评估这种能力仍具挑战性。

Method: 通过区分物理有效和不可能视频，使用去噪目标作为ELBO似然替代，在有效-无效视频对数据集上进行评估。

Result: 提出的评估指标PPE与人类偏好强对齐，优于现有最佳评估基线。系统基准测试显示，随着模型容量和推理设置的扩展，物理理解能力有明显改善趋势。

Conclusion: 尽管当前模型在处理复杂混沌动力学方面仍有困难，但模型容量和推理设置的扩展确实改善了物理理解能力，LikePhys为评估直觉物理提供了有效方法。

Abstract: Intuitive physics understanding in video diffusion models plays an essential
role in building general-purpose physically plausible world simulators, yet
accurately evaluating such capacity remains a challenging task due to the
difficulty in disentangling physics correctness from visual appearance in
generation. To the end, we introduce LikePhys, a training-free method that
evaluates intuitive physics in video diffusion models by distinguishing
physically valid and impossible videos using the denoising objective as an
ELBO-based likelihood surrogate on a curated dataset of valid-invalid pairs. By
testing on our constructed benchmark of twelve scenarios spanning over four
physics domains, we show that our evaluation metric, Plausibility Preference
Error (PPE), demonstrates strong alignment with human preference, outperforming
state-of-the-art evaluator baselines. We then systematically benchmark
intuitive physics understanding in current video diffusion models. Our study
further analyses how model design and inference settings affect intuitive
physics understanding and highlights domain-specific capacity variations across
physical laws. Empirical results show that, despite current models struggling
with complex and chaotic dynamics, there is a clear trend of improvement in
physics understanding as model capacity and inference settings scale.

TL;DR: mmWalk是一个用于盲人和低视力人群户外安全导航的多模态仿真数据集，包含12万手动控制的行走轨迹和62k同步帧，涵盖RGB、深度和语义模态的55.9万张全景图像。同时创建了mmWalkVQA基准测试，包含69k视觉问答对，用于评估视觉语言模型在风险评估和导航任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决盲人和低视力人群在极端或复杂环境中行走辅助的挑战，由于缺乏整体场景理解，需要开发能够提供全面环境感知的导航系统。

Method: 构建mmWalk多模态数据集，包含多视角传感器和面向无障碍的特征；生成mmWalkVQA视觉问答基准测试；评估最先进的视觉语言模型在零样本和少样本设置下的表现；在真实世界数据集上验证微调模型。

Result: 最先进的视觉语言模型在风险评估和导航任务上表现不佳；经过mmWalk微调的模型在真实世界数据集上显示出有效性，证明了数据集对推进多模态行走辅助的价值。

Conclusion: mmWalk数据集能够有效推进多模态行走辅助技术的发展，特别是在盲人和低视力人群的户外安全导航方面，为开发更智能的辅助系统提供了重要基础。

Abstract: Walking assistance in extreme or complex environments remains a significant
challenge for people with blindness or low vision (BLV), largely due to the
lack of a holistic scene understanding. Motivated by the real-world needs of
the BLV community, we build mmWalk, a simulated multi-modal dataset that
integrates multi-view sensor and accessibility-oriented features for outdoor
safe navigation. Our dataset comprises 120 manually controlled,
scenario-categorized walking trajectories with 62k synchronized frames. It
contains over 559k panoramic images across RGB, depth, and semantic modalities.
Furthermore, to emphasize real-world relevance, each trajectory involves
outdoor corner cases and accessibility-specific landmarks for BLV users.
Additionally, we generate mmWalkVQA, a VQA benchmark with over 69k visual
question-answer triplets across 9 categories tailored for safe and informed
walking assistance. We evaluate state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models (VLMs)
using zero- and few-shot settings and found they struggle with our risk
assessment and navigational tasks. We validate our mmWalk-finetuned model on
real-world datasets and show the effectiveness of our dataset for advancing
multi-modal walking assistance.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了DiT中的大规模激活现象，发现它们对局部细节合成至关重要，并提出了基于此的Detail Guidance方法，无需训练即可提升细节质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DiT内部特征图中存在大规模激活现象，但其功能尚未被充分理解，需要系统研究这些激活在视觉生成中的作用。

Method: 提出Detail Guidance方法：通过破坏大规模激活构建"细节缺陷"模型，并用其指导原始网络进行更高质量的细节合成，可与CFG无缝集成。

Result: 实验表明DG方法在各种预训练DiT模型（如SD3、SD3.5、Flux）上都能一致提升细粒度细节质量。

Conclusion: 大规模激活在局部细节合成中起关键作用，而Detail Guidance是一种有效的训练自由策略，能显著提升DiT的细节保真度。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have recently emerged as a powerful backbone
for visual generation. Recent observations reveal \emph{Massive Activations}
(MAs) in their internal feature maps, yet their function remains poorly
understood. In this work, we systematically investigate these activations to
elucidate their role in visual generation. We found that these massive
activations occur across all spatial tokens, and their distribution is
modulated by the input timestep embeddings. Importantly, our investigations
further demonstrate that these massive activations play a key role in local
detail synthesis, while having minimal impact on the overall semantic content
of output. Building on these insights, we propose \textbf{D}etail
\textbf{G}uidance (\textbf{DG}), a MAs-driven, training-free self-guidance
strategy to explicitly enhance local detail fidelity for DiTs. Specifically, DG
constructs a degraded ``detail-deficient'' model by disrupting MAs and
leverages it to guide the original network toward higher-quality detail
synthesis. Our DG can seamlessly integrate with Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG),
enabling further refinements of fine-grained details. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our DG consistently improves fine-grained detail quality
across various pre-trained DiTs (\eg, SD3, SD3.5, and Flux).

TL;DR: 提出了ODI-Bench基准测试来评估多模态大语言模型对全景图像的理解能力，并开发了Omni-CoT方法来提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型在传统2D图像和视频理解上表现优异，但对全景图像这种沉浸式环境理解能力尚未充分探索。

Method: 构建包含2000张全景图像和4000个问答对的ODI-Bench基准，涵盖10个细粒度任务；提出Omni-CoT方法，通过思维链推理结合文本和视觉线索来增强模型理解。

Result: 实验评估20个代表性MLLM模型，发现现有模型在全景图像理解上仍有困难；Omni-CoT方法能显著提升模型在全景环境中的理解能力。

Conclusion: 全景图像理解是MLLM的重要挑战，ODI-Bench为评估提供了标准，Omni-CoT展示了通过思维链推理提升模型性能的有效途径。

Abstract: Omnidirectional images (ODIs) provide full 360x180 view which are widely
adopted in VR, AR and embodied intelligence applications. While multi-modal
large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on
conventional 2D image and video understanding benchmarks, their ability to
comprehend the immersive environments captured by ODIs remains largely
unexplored. To address this gap, we first present ODI-Bench, a novel
comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for omnidirectional image
understanding. ODI-Bench contains 2,000 high-quality omnidirectional images and
over 4,000 manually annotated question-answering (QA) pairs across 10
fine-grained tasks, covering both general-level and spatial-level ODI
understanding. Extensive experiments are conducted to benchmark 20
representative MLLMs, including proprietary and open-source models, under both
close-ended and open-ended settings. Experimental results reveal that current
MLLMs still struggle to capture the immersive context provided by ODIs. To this
end, we further introduce Omni-CoT, a training-free method which significantly
enhances MLLMs' comprehension ability in the omnidirectional environment
through chain-of-thought reasoning across both textual information and visual
cues. Both the benchmark and the code will be released upon the publication.

TL;DR: 通过系统评估发现，XrayCLIP和XraySigLIP等基础模型在胸部X光分类中仅需少量标注样本就能达到良好性能，使用50个标注病例的学习曲线斜率可准确预测最终性能平台。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胸部X光分类通常需要大量标注数据，基础模型虽能减轻这种依赖，但所需标注样本数量仍不明确，需要系统评估以最小化标注成本。

Method: 使用幂律拟合方法预测达到特定ROC-AUC阈值所需的训练样本量，测试多种病理类型和基础模型，并与ResNet-50基线进行比较。

Result: XrayCLIP和XraySigLIP在显著少于ResNet-50基线所需标注样本的情况下达到强性能，仅用50个标注病例的学习曲线斜率就能准确预测最终性能平台。

Conclusion: 该方法使实践者能够通过仅标注达到目标性能所需的基本样本来最小化标注成本，为胸部X光分类的标注策略提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Chest X-ray classification is vital yet resource-intensive, typically
demanding extensive annotated data for accurate diagnosis. Foundation models
mitigate this reliance, but how many labeled samples are required remains
unclear. We systematically evaluate the use of power-law fits to predict the
training size necessary for specific ROC-AUC thresholds. Testing multiple
pathologies and foundation models, we find XrayCLIP and XraySigLIP achieve
strong performance with significantly fewer labeled examples than a ResNet-50
baseline. Importantly, learning curve slopes from just 50 labeled cases
accurately forecast final performance plateaus. Our results enable
practitioners to minimize annotation costs by labeling only the essential
samples for targeted performance.

TL;DR: SNAP是一个统一的交互式3D点云分割模型，支持点提示和文本提示，在室内、室外和航空等多种领域实现了跨域泛化能力，在零样本基准测试中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前3D点云分割方法通常局限于单一领域（室内或室外）和单一交互形式（空间点击或文本提示），在多数据集训练时容易出现负迁移问题，缺乏通用性。

Method: 在7个跨领域数据集上进行训练，采用域自适应归一化防止负迁移；对于文本提示分割，自动生成掩码提案并与CLIP文本查询嵌入匹配，支持全景和开放词汇分割。

Result: 在9个零样本基准测试中，8个空间提示分割任务达到最先进性能；在5个文本提示基准测试中均取得有竞争力的结果。

Conclusion: 统一模型可以匹配甚至超越专门的领域特定方法，为可扩展的3D标注提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Interactive 3D point cloud segmentation enables efficient annotation of
complex 3D scenes through user-guided prompts. However, current approaches are
typically restricted in scope to a single domain (indoor or outdoor), and to a
single form of user interaction (either spatial clicks or textual prompts).
Moreover, training on multiple datasets often leads to negative transfer,
resulting in domain-specific tools that lack generalizability. To address these
limitations, we present \textbf{SNAP} (\textbf{S}egment a\textbf{N}ything in
\textbf{A}ny \textbf{P}oint cloud), a unified model for interactive 3D
segmentation that supports both point-based and text-based prompts across
diverse domains. Our approach achieves cross-domain generalizability by
training on 7 datasets spanning indoor, outdoor, and aerial environments, while
employing domain-adaptive normalization to prevent negative transfer. For
text-prompted segmentation, we automatically generate mask proposals without
human intervention and match them against CLIP embeddings of textual queries,
enabling both panoptic and open-vocabulary segmentation. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that SNAP consistently delivers high-quality segmentation results.
We achieve state-of-the-art performance on 8 out of 9 zero-shot benchmarks for
spatial-prompted segmentation and demonstrate competitive results on all 5
text-prompted benchmarks. These results show that a unified model can match or
exceed specialized domain-specific approaches, providing a practical tool for
scalable 3D annotation. Project page is at, https://neu-vi.github.io/SNAP/

TL;DR: 提出了一种使用扩散模型将合成数据集适配到真实目标域的新框架，仅需不完美的伪标签即可生成高保真、目标对齐的图像，显著提升分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 合成数据集与真实图像存在明显差距，特别是在特定目标域（如Cityscapes）中，这种差距限制了模型性能。传统方法需要昂贵的3D建模，违背了低成本标注数据的初衷。

Method: 使用现成的扩散模型，仅通过不完美的伪标签进行目标域适配训练，能够从任何合成数据集的语义图生成高保真、目标对齐的图像，并过滤次优生成、修正图像标签不对齐问题。

Result: 在五个合成数据集和两个真实目标数据集上的实验显示，分割性能比最先进的翻译方法提升高达+8.0% mIoU，使快速构建的合成数据集达到与耗时数月手工设计的高质量合成数据集相当的效果。

Conclusion: 该工作展示了一种有价值的协作范式，快速语义原型设计与生成模型结合，能够为城市场景理解创建可扩展的高质量训练数据。

Abstract: Synthetic datasets are widely used for training urban scene recognition
models, but even highly realistic renderings show a noticeable gap to real
imagery. This gap is particularly pronounced when adapting to a specific target
domain, such as Cityscapes, where differences in architecture, vegetation,
object appearance, and camera characteristics limit downstream performance.
Closing this gap with more detailed 3D modelling would require expensive asset
and scene design, defeating the purpose of low-cost labelled data. To address
this, we present a new framework that adapts an off-the-shelf diffusion model
to a target domain using only imperfect pseudo-labels. Once trained, it
generates high-fidelity, target-aligned images from semantic maps of any
synthetic dataset, including low-effort sources created in hours rather than
months. The method filters suboptimal generations, rectifies image-label
misalignments, and standardises semantics across datasets, transforming weak
synthetic data into competitive real-domain training sets. Experiments on five
synthetic datasets and two real target datasets show segmentation gains of up
to +8.0%pt. mIoU over state-of-the-art translation methods, making rapidly
constructed synthetic datasets as effective as high-effort, time-intensive
synthetic datasets requiring extensive manual design. This work highlights a
valuable collaborative paradigm where fast semantic prototyping, combined with
generative models, enables scalable, high-quality training data creation for
urban scene understanding.

Motivation: 基础模型正在改变地球观测领域，但它们在作物分类中的潜力尚未充分探索。本研究旨在系统评估基础模型在作物分类任务中的表现。

Method: 使用三种基础模型进行作物分类：HyperSigma、DOFA和基于SpectralEarth数据集预训练的Vision Transformer。模型在训练区域进行微调，在独立测试区域评估性能，使用总体准确率、平均准确率和F1分数作为评估指标。

Result: HyperSigma总体准确率为34.5%，DOFA为62.6%，SpectralEarth模型达到93.5%。从头训练的紧凑版SpectralEarth模型也达到91%的准确率。

Abstract: Foundation models are transforming Earth observation, but their potential for
hyperspectral crop mapping remains underexplored. This study benchmarks three
foundation models for cereal crop mapping using hyperspectral imagery:
HyperSigma, DOFA, and Vision Transformers pre-trained on the SpectralEarth
dataset (a large multitemporal hyperspectral archive). Models were fine-tuned
on manually labeled data from a training region and evaluated on an independent
test region. Performance was measured with overall accuracy (OA), average
accuracy (AA), and F1-score. HyperSigma achieved an OA of 34.5% (+/- 1.8%),
DOFA reached 62.6% (+/- 3.5%), and the SpectralEarth model achieved an OA of
93.5% (+/- 0.8%). A compact SpectralEarth variant trained from scratch achieved
91%, highlighting the importance of model architecture for strong
generalization across geographic regions and sensor platforms. These results
provide a systematic evaluation of foundation models for operational
hyperspectral crop mapping and outline directions for future model development.

Motivation: 多模态情感分析面临标注数据稀缺的问题，而传统的Mixup增强方法在多模态场景下会因随机混合导致标签模糊和语义不一致，需要情感感知的混合机制。

Method: 提出MS-Mix框架，包含三个关键组件：情感感知样本选择策略防止情感矛盾样本混合；情感强度引导模块动态计算模态特定混合比例；情感对齐损失通过KL散度正则化联合训练情感强度预测器和主干网络。

Result: 在三个基准数据集和六个最先进骨干网络上的广泛实验表明，MS-Mix始终优于现有方法，为鲁棒的多模态情感增强建立了新标准。

Conclusion: MS-Mix通过情感感知的混合机制有效解决了多模态情感分析中的数据增强挑战，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA) aims to identify and interpret human
emotions by integrating information from heterogeneous data sources such as
text, video, and audio. While deep learning models have advanced in network
architecture design, they remain heavily limited by scarce multimodal annotated
data. Although Mixup-based augmentation improves generalization in unimodal
tasks, its direct application to MSA introduces critical challenges: random
mixing often amplifies label ambiguity and semantic inconsistency due to the
lack of emotion-aware mixing mechanisms. To overcome these issues, we propose
MS-Mix, an adaptive, emotion-sensitive augmentation framework that
automatically optimizes sample mixing in multimodal settings. The key
components of MS-Mix include: (1) a Sentiment-Aware Sample Selection (SASS)
strategy that effectively prevents semantic confusion caused by mixing samples
with contradictory emotions. (2) a Sentiment Intensity Guided (SIG) module
using multi-head self-attention to compute modality-specific mixing ratios
dynamically based on their respective emotional intensities. (3) a Sentiment
Alignment Loss (SAL) that aligns the prediction distributions across
modalities, and incorporates the Kullback-Leibler-based loss as an additional
regularization term to train the emotion intensity predictor and the backbone
network jointly. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets with six
state-of-the-art backbones confirm that MS-Mix consistently outperforms
existing methods, establishing a new standard for robust multimodal sentiment
augmentation. The source code is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统场景坐标回归方法在训练视图和查询图像成像条件差异较大时泛化能力不足，这是由于其训练目标是将训练视图编码到回归器权重中，本质上对训练视图过拟合。

Method: 将坐标回归器和地图表示分离为通用变换器和场景特定地图代码，在数万个场景上预训练变换器，使其能够从映射图像泛化到未见过的查询图像。

Result: 在多个具有挑战性的重定位数据集上，ACE-G方法显著提高了鲁棒性，同时保持了有吸引力的计算开销。

Conclusion: 通过分离坐标回归器和地图表示，并预训练通用变换器，ACE-G方法有效提升了场景坐标回归的泛化能力，解决了传统方法的过拟合问题。

Abstract: Scene coordinate regression (SCR) has established itself as a promising
learning-based approach to visual relocalization. After mere minutes of
scene-specific training, SCR models estimate camera poses of query images with
high accuracy. Still, SCR methods fall short of the generalization capabilities
of more classical feature-matching approaches. When imaging conditions of query
images, such as lighting or viewpoint, are too different from the training
views, SCR models fail. Failing to generalize is an inherent limitation of
previous SCR frameworks, since their training objective is to encode the
training views in the weights of the coordinate regressor itself. The regressor
essentially overfits to the training views, by design. We propose to separate
the coordinate regressor and the map representation into a generic transformer
and a scene-specific map code. This separation allows us to pre-train the
transformer on tens of thousands of scenes. More importantly, it allows us to
train the transformer to generalize from mapping images to unseen query images
during pre-training. We demonstrate on multiple challenging relocalization
datasets that our method, ACE-G, leads to significantly increased robustness
while keeping the computational footprint attractive.

TL;DR: ExpVid是首个用于系统评估多模态大语言模型在科学实验视频理解能力的基准测试，揭示了现有模型在细粒度感知、程序理解和科学推理方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基准测试忽视了真实实验室工作的细粒度和长时程特性，无法准确评估多模态大语言模型在科学实验理解方面的真实能力。

Method: 从同行评审的视频出版物中构建ExpVid基准，采用三层任务层次结构（细粒度感知、程序理解、科学推理），通过视觉中心标注流程结合自动生成和多学科专家验证。

Result: 评估19个领先MLLM发现，虽然它们在粗粒度识别方面表现出色，但在区分细粒度细节、跟踪状态变化以及将实验程序与科学结果联系起来方面存在困难，专有模型与开源模型之间存在显著性能差距。

Conclusion: ExpVid不仅提供了诊断工具，还为开发能够在科学实验中成为可信赖伙伴的MLLM指明了发展路线图。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) hold promise for accelerating
scientific discovery by interpreting complex experimental procedures. However,
their true capabilities are poorly understood, as existing benchmarks neglect
the fine-grained and long-horizon nature of authentic laboratory work,
especially in wet-lab settings. To bridge this gap, we introduce ExpVid, the
first benchmark designed to systematically evaluate MLLMs on scientific
experiment videos. Curated from peer-reviewed video publications, ExpVid
features a new three-level task hierarchy that mirrors the scientific process:
(1) Fine-grained Perception of tools, materials, and actions; (2) Procedural
Understanding of step order and completeness; and (3) Scientific Reasoning that
connects the full experiment to its published conclusions. Our vision-centric
annotation pipeline, combining automated generation with multi-disciplinary
expert validation, ensures that tasks require visual grounding. We evaluate 19
leading MLLMs on ExpVid and find that while they excel at coarse-grained
recognition, they struggle with disambiguating fine details, tracking state
changes over time, and linking experimental procedures to scientific outcomes.
Our results reveal a notable performance gap between proprietary and
open-source models, particularly in high-order reasoning. ExpVid not only
provides a diagnostic tool but also charts a roadmap for developing MLLMs
capable of becoming trustworthy partners in scientific experimentation.

enhancement performance, producing powerful models that cannot be deployed on
edge devices, or prioritized computational efficiency, resulting in inadequate
performance for real-world applications. To this end, this paper introduces a
pyramid network called LLF-LUT++, which integrates global and local operators
through closed-form Laplacian pyramid decomposition and reconstruction. This
approach enables fast processing of high-resolution images while also achieving
excellent performance. Specifically, we utilize an image-adaptive 3D LUT that
capitalizes on the global tonal characteristics of downsampled images, while
incorporating two distinct weight fusion strategies to achieve coarse global
image enhancement. To implement this strategy, we designed a spatial-frequency
transformer weight predictor that effectively extracts the desired distinct
weights by leveraging frequency features. Additionally, we apply local
Laplacian filters to adaptively refine edge details in high-frequency
components. After meticulously redesigning the network structure and
transformer model, LLF-LUT++ not only achieves a 2.64 dB improvement in PSNR on
the HDR+ dataset, but also further reduces runtime, with 4K resolution images
processed in just 13 ms on a single GPU. Extensive experimental results on two
benchmark datasets further show that the proposed approach performs favorably
compared to state-of-the-art methods. The source code will be made publicly
available at https://github.com/fengzhang427/LLF-LUT.

Abstract: Combining large language models with evolutionary computation algorithms
represents a promising research direction leveraging the remarkable generative
and in-context learning capabilities of LLMs with the strengths of evolutionary
algorithms. In this work, we present EvoCAD, a method for generating
computer-aided design (CAD) objects through their symbolic representations
using vision language models and evolutionary optimization. Our method samples
multiple CAD objects, which are then optimized using an evolutionary approach
with vision language and reasoning language models. We assess our method using
GPT-4V and GPT-4o, evaluating it on the CADPrompt benchmark dataset and
comparing it to prior methods. Additionally, we introduce two new metrics based
on topological properties defined by the Euler characteristic, which capture a
form of semantic similarity between 3D objects. Our results demonstrate that
EvoCAD outperforms previous approaches on multiple metrics, particularly in
generating topologically correct objects, which can be efficiently evaluated
using our two novel metrics that complement existing spatial metrics.

TL;DR: NV3D是一种新颖的3D物体检测模型，通过从体素邻居提取局部特征（法向量）来增强检测性能，并提出两种采样策略减少55%数据量同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态方法面临特征对齐挑战，而局部特征提取方法对于复杂3D物体检测任务可能过于简化。

Method: 使用KNN和PCA计算每个体素的法向量作为局部特征，提出法向量密度采样和FOV感知分箱采样两种策略减少数据量，并应用元素级注意力融合机制。

Result: 在KITTI数据集上，无采样时汽车和骑行者检测mAP分别达到86.60%和80.18%，比基线Voxel R-CNN提升2.61%和4.23%；使用采样后汽车检测mAP为85.54%，比基线提升1.56%，同时过滤掉约55%体素。

Conclusion: NV3D通过法向量特征有效提升了3D物体检测性能，特别是在汽车和骑行者检测上表现优异，同时采样策略显著减少了计算量。

Abstract: Recent studies in 3D object detection for autonomous vehicles aim to enrich
features through the utilization of multi-modal setups or the extraction of
local patterns within LiDAR point clouds. However, multi-modal methods face
significant challenges in feature alignment, and gaining features locally can
be oversimplified for complex 3D object detection tasks. In this paper, we
propose a novel model, NV3D, which utilizes local features acquired from voxel
neighbors, as normal vectors computed per voxel basis using K-nearest neighbors
(KNN) and principal component analysis (PCA). This informative feature enables
NV3D to determine the relationship between the surface and pertinent target
entities, including cars, pedestrians, or cyclists. During the normal vector
extraction process, NV3D offers two distinct sampling strategies: normal vector
density-based sampling and FOV-aware bin-based sampling, allowing elimination
of up to 55% of data while maintaining performance. In addition, we applied
element-wise attention fusion, which accepts voxel features as the query and
value and normal vector features as the key, similar to the attention
mechanism. Our method is trained on the KITTI dataset and has demonstrated
superior performance in car and cyclist detection owing to their spatial
shapes. In the validation set, NV3D without sampling achieves 86.60% and 80.18%
mean Average Precision (mAP), greater than the baseline Voxel R-CNN by 2.61%
and 4.23% mAP, respectively. With both samplings, NV3D achieves 85.54% mAP in
car detection, exceeding the baseline by 1.56% mAP, despite roughly 55% of
voxels being filtered out.

Abstract: Instruction-guided video editing has emerged as a rapidly advancing research
direction, offering new opportunities for intuitive content transformation
while also posing significant challenges for systematic evaluation. Existing
video editing benchmarks fail to support the evaluation of instruction-guided
video editing adequately and further suffer from limited source diversity,
narrow task coverage and incomplete evaluation metrics. To address the above
limitations, we introduce IVEBench, a modern benchmark suite specifically
designed for instruction-guided video editing assessment. IVEBench comprises a
diverse database of 600 high-quality source videos, spanning seven semantic
dimensions, and covering video lengths ranging from 32 to 1,024 frames. It
further includes 8 categories of editing tasks with 35 subcategories, whose
prompts are generated and refined through large language models and expert
review. Crucially, IVEBench establishes a three-dimensional evaluation protocol
encompassing video quality, instruction compliance and video fidelity,
integrating both traditional metrics and multimodal large language model-based
assessments. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of IVEBench in
benchmarking state-of-the-art instruction-guided video editing methods, showing
its ability to provide comprehensive and human-aligned evaluation outcomes.

TL;DR: PhySIC是一个从单张RGB图像重建度量准确的人类和场景的框架，通过物理约束解决深度模糊、遮挡和接触不一致问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的单图像3D重建方法在处理深度模糊、遮挡和物理接触一致性方面存在困难，需要开发能够产生物理合理的人类-场景交互重建的方法。

Method: 从粗略的单目深度和人体估计开始，进行遮挡感知修复，融合可见深度与未缩放几何体构建度量支架，合成缺失支撑表面，并通过置信度加权优化联合执行深度对齐、接触先验、避免穿透和2D重投影一致性。

Conclusion: PhySIC通过将单张图像转换为物理合理的3D人类-场景对，推进了可扩展的3D场景理解，能够处理多个人类并重建多样化的交互。

Abstract: Reconstructing metrically accurate humans and their surrounding scenes from a
single image is crucial for virtual reality, robotics, and comprehensive 3D
scene understanding. However, existing methods struggle with depth ambiguity,
occlusions, and physically inconsistent contacts. To address these challenges,
we introduce PhySIC, a framework for physically plausible Human-Scene
Interaction and Contact reconstruction. PhySIC recovers metrically consistent
SMPL-X human meshes, dense scene surfaces, and vertex-level contact maps within
a shared coordinate frame from a single RGB image. Starting from coarse
monocular depth and body estimates, PhySIC performs occlusion-aware inpainting,
fuses visible depth with unscaled geometry for a robust metric scaffold, and
synthesizes missing support surfaces like floors. A confidence-weighted
optimization refines body pose, camera parameters, and global scale by jointly
enforcing depth alignment, contact priors, interpenetration avoidance, and 2D
reprojection consistency. Explicit occlusion masking safeguards invisible
regions against implausible configurations. PhySIC is efficient, requiring only
9 seconds for joint human-scene optimization and under 27 seconds end-to-end.
It naturally handles multiple humans, enabling reconstruction of diverse
interactions. Empirically, PhySIC outperforms single-image baselines, reducing
mean per-vertex scene error from 641 mm to 227 mm, halving PA-MPJPE to 42 mm,
and improving contact F1 from 0.09 to 0.51. Qualitative results show realistic
foot-floor interactions, natural seating, and plausible reconstructions of
heavily occluded furniture. By converting a single image into a physically
plausible 3D human-scene pair, PhySIC advances scalable 3D scene understanding.

Abstract: Generating realistic and controllable 3D human avatars is a long-standing
challenge, particularly when covering broad attribute ranges such as ethnicity,
age, clothing styles, and detailed body shapes. Capturing and annotating
large-scale human datasets for training generative models is prohibitively
expensive and limited in scale and diversity. The central question we address
in this paper is: Can existing foundation models be distilled to generate
theoretically unbounded, richly annotated 3D human data? We introduce
InfiniHuman, a framework that synergistically distills these models to produce
richly annotated human data at minimal cost and with theoretically unlimited
scalability. We propose InfiniHumanData, a fully automatic pipeline that
leverages vision-language and image generation models to create a large-scale
multi-modal dataset. User study shows our automatically generated identities
are undistinguishable from scan renderings. InfiniHumanData contains 111K
identities spanning unprecedented diversity. Each identity is annotated with
multi-granularity text descriptions, multi-view RGB images, detailed clothing
images, and SMPL body-shape parameters. Building on this dataset, we propose
InfiniHumanGen, a diffusion-based generative pipeline conditioned on text, body
shape, and clothing assets. InfiniHumanGen enables fast, realistic, and
precisely controllable avatar generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate
significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods in visual quality,
generation speed, and controllability. Our approach enables high-quality avatar
generation with fine-grained control at effectively unbounded scale through a
practical and affordable solution. We will publicly release the automatic data
generation pipeline, the comprehensive InfiniHumanData dataset, and the
InfiniHumanGen models at https://yuxuan-xue.com/infini-human.

Motivation: 现有自动概念发现方法往往无法将提取的概念与模型真实决策过程对齐，从而损害解释的忠实度。

Method: 在非负矩阵分解基础上加入KL散度正则化项，在概念学习过程中融入分类器监督，强制预测一致性。

Conclusion: FACE框架能够提供更忠实的概念解释，理论保证表明最小化KL散度可以约束预测分布的偏差，促进学习概念空间中的忠实局部线性。

Abstract: Interpreting deep neural networks through concept-based explanations offers a
bridge between low-level features and high-level human-understandable
semantics. However, existing automatic concept discovery methods often fail to
align these extracted concepts with the model's true decision-making process,
thereby compromising explanation faithfulness. In this work, we propose FACE
(Faithful Automatic Concept Extraction), a novel framework that augments
Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) with a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence
regularization term to ensure alignment between the model's original and
concept-based predictions. Unlike prior methods that operate solely on encoder
activations, FACE incorporates classifier supervision during concept learning,
enforcing predictive consistency and enabling faithful explanations. We provide
theoretical guarantees showing that minimizing the KL divergence bounds the
deviation in predictive distributions, thereby promoting faithful local
linearity in the learned concept space. Systematic evaluations on ImageNet,
COCO, and CelebA datasets demonstrate that FACE outperforms existing methods
across faithfulness and sparsity metrics.

Conclusion: 该框架为机器人和具身AI中的开放集6D理解建立了新标准，实现了实时推理和强大的跨类别泛化能力。

Abstract: Estimating an object's 6D pose, size, and shape from visual input is a
fundamental problem in computer vision, with critical applications in robotic
grasping and manipulation. Existing methods either rely on object-specific
priors such as CAD models or templates, or suffer from limited generalization
across categories due to pose-shape entanglement and multi-stage pipelines. In
this work, we propose a unified, category-agnostic framework that
simultaneously predicts 6D pose, size, and dense shape from a single RGB-D
image, without requiring templates, CAD models, or category labels at test
time. Our model fuses dense 2D features from vision foundation models with
partial 3D point clouds using a Transformer encoder enhanced by a
Mixture-of-Experts, and employs parallel decoders for pose-size estimation and
shape reconstruction, achieving real-time inference at 28 FPS. Trained solely
on synthetic data from 149 categories in the SOPE dataset, our framework is
evaluated on four diverse benchmarks SOPE, ROPE, ObjaversePose, and HANDAL,
spanning over 300 categories. It achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on seen
categories while demonstrating remarkably strong zero-shot generalization to
unseen real-world objects, establishing a new standard for open-set 6D
understanding in robotics and embodied AI.

TL;DR: 本文提出用表示自编码器（RAE）替代传统VAE作为扩散变换器的潜在编码器，解决了VAE在架构、信息容量和表示质量方面的限制，实现了更好的图像生成效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统扩散变换器使用过时的VAE编码器存在三个主要问题：架构简单性受损、低维潜在空间限制信息容量、以及纯重建训练导致的弱表示质量，这些都限制了生成质量。

Method: 使用预训练表示编码器（如DINO、SigLIP、MAE）配合训练的解码器构建表示自编码器（RAE），并针对高维潜在空间设计了理论驱动的解决方案，包括轻量级宽DDT头。

Result: 在ImageNet上实现了无引导下256x256分辨率1.51 FID，有引导下256x256和512x512分辨率均达到1.13 FID的强生成结果，收敛更快且无需辅助表示对齐损失。

Conclusion: RAE具有明显优势，应该成为扩散变换器训练的新标准配置。

Abstract: Latent generative modeling, where a pretrained autoencoder maps pixels into a
latent space for the diffusion process, has become the standard strategy for
Diffusion Transformers (DiT); however, the autoencoder component has barely
evolved. Most DiTs continue to rely on the original VAE encoder, which
introduces several limitations: outdated backbones that compromise
architectural simplicity, low-dimensional latent spaces that restrict
information capacity, and weak representations that result from purely
reconstruction-based training and ultimately limit generative quality. In this
work, we explore replacing the VAE with pretrained representation encoders
(e.g., DINO, SigLIP, MAE) paired with trained decoders, forming what we term
Representation Autoencoders (RAEs). These models provide both high-quality
reconstructions and semantically rich latent spaces, while allowing for a
scalable transformer-based architecture. Since these latent spaces are
typically high-dimensional, a key challenge is enabling diffusion transformers
to operate effectively within them. We analyze the sources of this difficulty,
propose theoretically motivated solutions, and validate them empirically. Our
approach achieves faster convergence without auxiliary representation alignment
losses. Using a DiT variant equipped with a lightweight, wide DDT head, we
achieve strong image generation results on ImageNet: 1.51 FID at 256x256 (no
guidance) and 1.13 at both 256x256 and 512x512 (with guidance). RAE offers
clear advantages and should be the new default for diffusion transformer
training.

Conclusion: 这种混合方法在图像分类中具有更高效和鲁棒的潜力。

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been established as the main
workhorse in image data processing; nonetheless, they require large amounts of
data to train, often produce overconfident predictions, and frequently lack the
ability to quantify the uncertainty of their predictions. To address these
concerns, we propose a new Bayesian topological CNN that promotes a novel
interplay between topology-aware learning and Bayesian sampling. Specifically,
it utilizes information from important manifolds to accelerate training while
reducing calibration error by placing prior distributions on network parameters
and properly learning appropriate posteriors. One important contribution of our
work is the inclusion of a consistency condition in the learning cost, which
can effectively modify the prior distributions to improve the performance of
our novel network architecture. We evaluate the model on benchmark image
classification datasets and demonstrate its superiority over conventional CNNs,
Bayesian neural networks (BNNs), and topological CNNs. In particular, we supply
evidence that our method provides an advantage in situations where training
data is limited or corrupted. Furthermore, we show that the new model allows
for better uncertainty quantification than standard BNNs since it can more
readily identify examples of out-of-distribution data on which it has not been
trained. Our results highlight the potential of our novel hybrid approach for
more efficient and robust image classification.

Conclusion: DiT360通过数据中心的视角和混合训练策略，显著提升了全景图像生成的几何保真度和照片真实感。

Abstract: In this work, we propose DiT360, a DiT-based framework that performs hybrid
training on perspective and panoramic data for panoramic image generation. For
the issues of maintaining geometric fidelity and photorealism in generation
quality, we attribute the main reason to the lack of large-scale, high-quality,
real-world panoramic data, where such a data-centric view differs from prior
methods that focus on model design. Basically, DiT360 has several key modules
for inter-domain transformation and intra-domain augmentation, applied at both
the pre-VAE image level and the post-VAE token level. At the image level, we
incorporate cross-domain knowledge through perspective image guidance and
panoramic refinement, which enhance perceptual quality while regularizing
diversity and photorealism. At the token level, hybrid supervision is applied
across multiple modules, which include circular padding for boundary
continuity, yaw loss for rotational robustness, and cube loss for distortion
awareness. Extensive experiments on text-to-panorama, inpainting, and
outpainting tasks demonstrate that our method achieves better boundary
consistency and image fidelity across eleven quantitative metrics. Our code is

Motivation: 跟踪器和视频生成器解决密切相关的问题：前者分析运动，后者合成运动。这种联系使得预训练的视频扩散模型能够通过视觉标记点来进行零样本点跟踪。

Method: 在查询点放置独特颜色的标记，然后从中等噪声水平重新生成视频的其余部分，使标记在帧间传播。使用未编辑的初始帧作为负提示，确保标记在反事实生成中保持可见。

Result: 实验表明，这种"涌现"跟踪方法优于先前的零样本方法，能够持续通过遮挡，性能与专门的自监督模型相当。

Conclusion: 预训练的视频扩散模型可以通过简单的提示实现有效的零样本点跟踪，展示了生成模型在运动分析任务中的潜力。

Abstract: Trackers and video generators solve closely related problems: the former
analyze motion, while the latter synthesize it. We show that this connection
enables pretrained video diffusion models to perform zero-shot point tracking
by simply prompting them to visually mark points as they move over time. We
place a distinctively colored marker at the query point, then regenerate the
rest of the video from an intermediate noise level. This propagates the marker
across frames, tracing the point's trajectory. To ensure that the marker
remains visible in this counterfactual generation, despite such markers being
unlikely in natural videos, we use the unedited initial frame as a negative
prompt. Through experiments with multiple image-conditioned video diffusion
models, we find that these "emergent" tracks outperform those of prior
zero-shot methods and persist through occlusions, often obtaining performance
that is competitive with specialized self-supervised models.

Conclusion: Ev4DGS证明了仅从事件流渲染非刚性变形物体新视角的可行性，为事件相机在动态场景中的应用开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Event cameras offer various advantages for novel view rendering compared to
synchronously operating RGB cameras, and efficient event-based techniques
supporting rigid scenes have been recently demonstrated in the literature. In
the case of non-rigid objects, however, existing approaches additionally
require sparse RGB inputs, which can be a substantial practical limitation; it
remains unknown if similar models could be learned from event streams only.
This paper sheds light on this challenging open question and introduces Ev4DGS,
i.e., the first approach for novel view rendering of non-rigidly deforming
objects in the explicit observation space (i.e., as RGB or greyscale images)
from monocular event streams. Our method regresses a deformable 3D Gaussian
Splatting representation through 1) a loss relating the outputs of the
estimated model with the 2D event observation space, and 2) a coarse 3D
deformation model trained from binary masks generated from events. We perform
experimental comparisons on existing synthetic and newly recorded real datasets
with non-rigid objects. The results demonstrate the validity of Ev4DGS and its
superior performance compared to multiple naive baselines that can be applied
in our setting. We will release our models and the datasets used in the
evaluation for research purposes; see the project webpage:

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Language Models
(VLMs) have shown significant progress in mathematical reasoning, yet they
still face a critical bottleneck with problems requiring visual assistance,
such as drawing auxiliary lines or plotting functions to solve the problems.
Most LLMs and VLMs are constrained to text-only reasoning chains, while
multimodal unified models that can generate interleaved text and images lack
the necessary precision and controllability for such tasks. To address this, we
propose CodePlot-CoT, a code-driven Chain-of-Thought paradigm for "thinking
with images" in mathematics. Our approach leverages the VLM to generate text
reasoning as well as executable plotting code, which is then rendered into
images as "visual thought", to solve mathematical problems. To achieve this, we
first construct Math-VR, the first large-scale, bilingual dataset and benchmark
for Mathematics problems with Visual Reasoning, comprising 178K samples.
Second, to create high-quality training data, we develop a state-of-the-art
image-to-code converter specialized for parsing complex mathematical figures
into codes. Finally, using these training data, we train the CodePlot-CoT model
for solving mathematical problems. Experimental results show that our model
achieves up to 21% increase over base model on our new benchmark, fully
validating the efficacy of our proposed code-driven reasoning paradigm. Our
work opens a new direction for multimodal mathematical reasoning and provides
the community with the first large-scale dataset, comprehensive benchmark, and
strong approach for such problems. To facilitate future research, we make our
datasets, code, and pretrained models publicly available at
https://github.com/HKU-MMLab/Math-VR-CodePlot-CoT.

Abstract: Temporal sequential tasks challenge humanoid robots, as existing Diffusion
Policy (DP) and Action Chunking with Transformers (ACT) methods often lack
temporal context, resulting in local optima traps and excessive repetitive
actions. To address these issues, this paper introduces a Classifier-Free
Guidance-Based Diffusion Policy (CFG-DP), a novel framework to enhance DP by
integrating Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) with conditional and unconditional
models. Specifically, CFG leverages timestep inputs to track task progression
and ensure precise cycle termination. It dynamically adjusts action predictions
based on task phase, using a guidance factor tuned to balance temporal
coherence and action accuracy. Real-world experiments on a humanoid robot
demonstrate high success rates and minimal repetitive actions. Furthermore, we
assessed the model's ability to terminate actions and examined how different
components and parameter adjustments affect its performance. This framework
significantly enhances deterministic control and execution reliability for
sequential robotic tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前触觉传感器形状和尺寸各异，导致模型难以通用化，大多数模型都绑定在特定传感器设计上。

Conclusion: 这些模型为传感器转换提供了灵活解决方案，可根据数据可用性和应用需求选择合适方法。

Abstract: Today's visuo-tactile sensors come in many shapes and sizes, making it
challenging to develop general-purpose tactile representations. This is because
most models are tied to a specific sensor design. To address this challenge, we
propose two approaches to cross-sensor image generation. The first is an
end-to-end method that leverages paired data (Touch2Touch). The second method
builds an intermediate depth representation and does not require paired data
(T2D2: Touch-to-Depth-to-Touch). Both methods enable the use of sensor-specific
models across multiple sensors via the cross-sensor touch generation process.
Together, these models offer flexible solutions for sensor translation,
depending on data availability and application needs. We demonstrate their
effectiveness on downstream tasks such as in-hand pose estimation and behavior
cloning, successfully transferring models trained on one sensor to another.

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在半静态场景中显著提高了渲染质量和地图更新效率。

Conclusion: VG-Mapping为半静态场景的在线地图构建提供了有效解决方案，并发布了相关数据集和代码。

Abstract: Maintaining an up-to-date map that accurately reflects recent changes in the
environment is crucial, especially for robots that repeatedly traverse the same
space. Failing to promptly update the changed regions can degrade map quality,
resulting in poor localization, inefficient operations, and even lost robots.
3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently seen widespread adoption in online
map reconstruction due to its dense, differentiable, and photorealistic
properties, yet accurately and efficiently updating the regions of change
remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose VG-Mapping, a novel online
3DGS-based mapping system tailored for such semi-static scenes. Our approach
introduces a hybrid representation that augments 3DGS with a TSDF-based voxel
map to efficiently identify changed regions in a scene, along with a
variation-aware density control strategy that inserts or deletes Gaussian
primitives in regions undergoing change. Furthermore, to address the absence of
public benchmarks for this task, we construct a RGB-D dataset comprising both
synthetic and real-world semi-static environments. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method substantially improves the rendering quality and
map update efficiency in semi-static scenes. The code and dataset are available
at https://github.com/heyicheng-never/VG-Mapping.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于大语言模型的自动行为树构建框架，用于异构多机器人系统在动态环境中的自适应协作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统机器人受限于固定功能属性，无法有效应对任务失败或环境变化。需要结合LLMs的推理能力和行为树的模块化特性，提高多机器人系统的适应性和鲁棒性。

Method: 框架包含四个互联模块：任务初始化、任务分配、行为树更新和失败节点检测。机器人执行时tick行为树，遇到失败节点时可本地扩展树或调用中央虚拟协调器重新分配子任务。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了异构多机器人在复杂场景下的长期协作问题，展示了LLMs与行为树结合在多机器人系统中的潜力。

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for automatic behavior tree (BT) construction
in heterogeneous multi-robot systems, designed to address the challenges of
adaptability and robustness in dynamic environments. Traditional robots are
limited by fixed functional attributes and cannot efficiently reconfigure their
strategies in response to task failures or environmental changes. To overcome
this limitation, we leverage large language models (LLMs) to generate and
extend BTs dynamically, combining the reasoning and generalization power of
LLMs with the modularity and recovery capability of BTs. The proposed framework
consists of four interconnected modules task initialization, task assignment,
BT update, and failure node detection which operate in a closed loop. Robots
tick their BTs during execution, and upon encountering a failure node, they can
either extend the tree locally or invoke a centralized virtual coordinator
(Alex) to reassign subtasks and synchronize BTs across peers. This design
enables long-term cooperative execution in heterogeneous teams. We validate the
framework on 60 tasks across three simulated scenarios and in a real-world cafe
environment with a robotic arm and a wheeled-legged robot. Results show that
our method consistently outperforms baseline approaches in task success rate,
robustness, and scalability, demonstrating its effectiveness for multi-robot
collaboration in complex scenarios.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出FORM方法，一种实时LiDAR里程计，通过密集因子图平滑和单迭代地图匹配，解决传统子图方法误差传播和轨迹抖动问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LiDAR里程计方法多为子图架构，会将位姿估计误差传播到固定子图中，导致轨迹抖动并影响后续配准精度

Method: 使用固定滞后平滑的密集因子图，同时采用单一迭代地图进行匹配，实现实时性能并能主动修正局部地图

Result: 在多个数据集上验证，FORM相比现有最先进方法具有鲁棒性、准确性、实时性，并提供平滑轨迹估计

Conclusion: FORM方法通过结合因子图平滑和单地图匹配，实现了实时、准确且平滑的LiDAR里程计性能

Abstract: Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensors have become a de-facto sensor for
many robot state estimation tasks, spurring development of many LiDAR Odometry
(LO) methods in recent years. While some smoothing-based LO methods have been
proposed, most require matching against multiple scans, resulting in
sub-real-time performance. Due to this, most prior works estimate a single
state at a time and are ``submap''-based. This architecture propagates any
error in pose estimation to the fixed submap and can cause jittery trajectories
and degrade future registrations. We propose Fixed-Lag Odometry with Reparative
Mapping (FORM), a LO method that performs smoothing over a densely connected
factor graph while utilizing a single iterative map for matching. This allows
for both real-time performance and active correction of the local map as pose
estimates are further refined. We evaluate on a wide variety of datasets to
show that FORM is robust, accurate, real-time, and provides smooth trajectory
estimates when compared to prior state-of-the-art LO methods.

Abstract: Hybrid locomotion of wheeled-legged robots has recently attracted increasing
attention due to their advantages of combining the agility of legged locomotion
and the efficiency of wheeled motion. But along with expanded performance, the
whole-body control of wheeled-legged robots remains challenging for hybrid
locomotion. In this paper, we present ATRos, a reinforcement learning
(RL)-based hybrid locomotion framework to achieve hybrid walking-driving
motions on the wheeled-legged robot. Without giving predefined gait patterns,
our planner aims to intelligently coordinate simultaneous wheel and leg
movements, thereby achieving improved terrain adaptability and improved energy
efficiency. Based on RL techniques, our approach constructs a prediction policy
network that could estimate external environmental states from proprioceptive
sensory information, and the outputs are then fed into an actor critic network
to produce optimal joint commands. The feasibility of the proposed framework is
validated through both simulations and real-world experiments across diverse
terrains, including flat ground, stairs, and grassy surfaces. The hybrid
locomotion framework shows robust performance over various unseen terrains,
highlighting its generalization capability.

Conclusion: 该研究为软硬混合夹持器设计提供了新见解，推进了精准农业自动化策略，同时最大程度减少作物损伤。

Abstract: The agricultural sector is rapidly evolving to meet growing global food
demands, yet tasks like fruit and vegetable handling remain labor-intensive,
causing inefficiencies and post-harvest losses. Automation, particularly
selective harvesting, offers a viable solution, with soft robotics emerging as
a key enabler. This study introduces a novel hybrid gripper for tomato
harvesting, incorporating a rigid outer frame with a soft auxetic internal
lattice. The six-finger, 3D caging-effect design enables gentle yet secure
grasping in unstructured environments. Uniquely, the work investigates the
effect of auxetic lattice orientation on grasping conformability, combining
experimental validation with 2D Digital Image Correlation (DIC) and nonlinear
finite element analysis (FEA). Auxetic configurations with unit cell
inclinations of 0 deg, 30 deg, 45 deg, and 60 deg are evaluated, and their
grasping forces, deformation responses, and motor torque requirements are
systematically compared. Results demonstrate that lattice orientation strongly
influences compliance, contact forces, and energy efficiency, with distinct
advantages across configurations. This comparative framework highlights the
novelty of tailoring auxetic geometries to optimize robotic gripper
performance. The findings provide new insights into soft-rigid hybrid gripper
design, advancing automation strategies for precision agriculture while
minimizing crop damage.

TL;DR: LOMORO是一个在线多机器人协作目标监控系统，通过资源感知的任务协调和在线适应算法，在保证监控间隔和资源水平的同时最小化活跃机器人数量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长期监控多个动态目标对人类操作员来说很繁琐，对单个机器人不可行。现有方法要么部署所有可用机器人而不最小化规模，要么忽略电池和内存等资源约束。

Method: 包含三个核心组件：(I)资源约束和监控间隔下的多机器人任务分配建模；(II)资源感知任务协调算法，通过Martin算法在高层次目标分配和低层次多目标路由间迭代；(III)针对不可预测目标行为和机器人故障的在线适应算法。

Result: 通过大规模仿真验证，在不同道路网络、机器人速度、充电速率和监控间隔下，相比多个基线方法表现更优。

Conclusion: LOMORO系统能够确保所有目标的监控间隔有明确上界，所有机器人的资源水平有明确下界，同时最小化平均活跃机器人数量，实现了高效的多机器人协作监控。

Abstract: Long-term monitoring of numerous dynamic targets can be tedious for a human
operator and infeasible for a single robot, e.g., to monitor wild flocks,
detect intruders, search and rescue. Fleets of autonomous robots can be
effective by acting collaboratively and concurrently. However, the online
coordination is challenging due to the unknown behaviors of the targets and the
limited perception of each robot. Existing work often deploys all robots
available without minimizing the fleet size, or neglects the constraints on
their resources such as battery and memory. This work proposes an online
coordination scheme called LOMORO for collaborative target monitoring, path
routing and resource charging. It includes three core components: (I) the
modeling of multi-robot task assignment problem under the constraints on
resources and monitoring intervals; (II) the resource-aware task coordination
algorithm iterates between the high-level assignment of dynamic targets and the
low-level multi-objective routing via the Martin's algorithm; (III) the online
adaptation algorithm in case of unpredictable target behaviors and robot
failures. It ensures the explicitly upper-bounded monitoring intervals for all
targets and the lower-bounded resource levels for all robots, while minimizing
the average number of active robots. The proposed methods are validated
extensively via large-scale simulations against several baselines, under
different road networks, robot velocities, charging rates and monitoring
intervals.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然月球GNSS导航已被验证，但未建模的电离层和等离子体层延迟仍然是重要误差源，特别是在独特的信号几何和长传播路径下。

Method: 使用全球核心等离子体模型(GCPM)和自定义低成本光线追踪算法，迭代求解弯曲信号路径，模拟不同太阳和地磁条件下的群延迟和路径弯曲延迟。

Result: 平均群延迟约为1米，但在高太阳活动期间低高度射线路径可超过100米；弯曲延迟通常较小，但对低高度射线路径不可忽略。

Conclusion: 这些发现为利用地面GNSS信号的稳健定位和定时算法设计提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Recent advancements in lunar positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) have
demonstrated that terrestrial GNSS signals, including weak sidelobe
transmissions, can be exploited for lunar spacecraft positioning and timing.
While GNSS-based navigation at the Moon has been validated recently, unmodeled
ionospheric and plasmaspheric delays remain a significant error source,
particularly given the unique signal geometry and extended propagation paths.
This paper characterizes these delays using the Global Core Plasma Model (GCPM)
and a custom low-cost ray-tracing algorithm that iteratively solves for bent
signal paths. We simulate first-, second-, and third-order group delays, as
well as excess path length from ray bending, for GNSS signals received at both
lunar orbit and the lunar south pole under varying solar and geomagnetic
conditions. Results show that mean group delays are typically on the order of 1
m, but can exceed 100 m for low-altitude ray paths during high solar activity,
while bending delays are generally smaller but non-negligible for low-altitude
ray paths. We also quantify the influence of signal frequency, geomagnetic
$K_p$ index, and solar R12 index. These findings inform the design of robust
positioning and timing algorithms that utilize terrestrial GNSS signals.

Motivation: 当前自动驾驶预测模型的评估方法过于依赖简单的ADE和FDE指标，这些指标无法充分反映模型在复杂、交互性和安全关键场景中的表现，特别是无法区分附近与远处智能体的影响，以及多智能体交互下的鲁棒性。

Method: 提出新颖的测试框架，评估预测模型在不同场景结构下的性能，包括地图上下文、智能体密度和空间分布等因素，通过实证分析量化智能体接近度对目标轨迹预测的影响。

Conclusion: 该框架为严格的、安全驱动的预测验证奠定了基础，有助于识别易发生故障的极端情况，并促进开发鲁棒、可认证的自动驾驶预测系统。

Abstract: Current evaluation methods for autonomous driving prediction models rely
heavily on simplistic metrics such as Average Displacement Error (ADE) and
Final Displacement Error (FDE). While these metrics offer basic performance
assessments, they fail to capture the nuanced behavior of prediction modules
under complex, interactive, and safety-critical driving scenarios. For
instance, existing benchmarks do not distinguish the influence of nearby versus
distant agents, nor systematically test model robustness across varying
multi-agent interactions. This paper addresses this critical gap by proposing a
novel testing framework that evaluates prediction performance under diverse
scene structures, saying, map context, agent density and spatial distribution.
Through extensive empirical analysis, we quantify the differential impact of
agent proximity on target trajectory prediction and identify scenario-specific
failure cases that are not exposed by traditional metrics. Our findings
highlight key vulnerabilities in current state-of-the-art prediction models and
demonstrate the importance of scenario-aware evaluation. The proposed framework
lays the groundwork for rigorous, safety-driven prediction validation,
contributing significantly to the identification of failure-prone corner cases
and the development of robust, certifiable prediction systems for autonomous
vehicles.

Conclusion: 该方法为机器人策略评估和改进提供了一种可扩展的解决方案，显著降低了真实世界测试的需求和成本。

Abstract: Generalist robot policies can now perform a wide range of manipulation
skills, but evaluating and improving their ability with unfamiliar objects and
instructions remains a significant challenge. Rigorous evaluation requires a
large number of real-world rollouts, while systematic improvement demands
additional corrective data with expert labels. Both of these processes are
slow, costly, and difficult to scale. World models offer a promising, scalable
alternative by enabling policies to rollout within imagination space. However,
a key challenge is building a controllable world model that can handle
multi-step interactions with generalist robot policies. This requires a world
model compatible with modern generalist policies by supporting multi-view
prediction, fine-grained action control, and consistent long-horizon
interactions, which is not achieved by previous works. In this paper, we make a
step forward by introducing a controllable multi-view world model that can be
used to evaluate and improve the instruction-following ability of generalist
robot policies. Our model maintains long-horizon consistency with a
pose-conditioned memory retrieval mechanism and achieves precise action control
through frame-level action conditioning. Trained on the DROID dataset (95k
trajectories, 564 scenes), our model generates spatially and temporally
consistent trajectories under novel scenarios and new camera placements for
over 20 seconds. We show that our method can accurately rank policy performance
without real-world robot rollouts. Moreover, by synthesizing successful
trajectories in imagination and using them for supervised fine-tuning, our
approach can improve policy success by 44.7\%.

TL;DR: 提出从路径模仿转向决策理解的新范式，通过Compass-Data-22k数据集和gap-aware混合奖励函数，训练LVLM导航代理发展内部"指南针"，在导航基准测试中达到新SOTA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LVLM导航训练主要依赖模仿专家轨迹，将复杂导航任务简化为单一正确路径的序列复制，限制了代理的探索和泛化能力。

Method: 1) 引入Compass-Data-22k数据集，其RFT子集使用A*测地距离标注所有可行动作；2) 设计gap-aware混合奖励函数，根据决策确定性动态调整反馈；3) 采用SFT-then-RFT训练策略。

Result: 7B代理在目标导航基准测试中达到新SOTA，超越更大的专有模型，并在物理机器人上实现稳健的实时目标导航。

Conclusion: 决策理解范式使代理不再记忆静态路线，而是发展内部指南针来评估所有可能移动的相对质量，实现更好的导航性能。

Abstract: The dominant paradigm for training Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) in
navigation relies on imitating expert trajectories. This approach reduces the
complex navigation task to a sequence-to-sequence replication of a single
correct path, fundamentally limiting the agent's ability to explore and
generalize. In this work, we argue for and introduce a new paradigm: a shift
from Path Imitation to Decision Understanding. The goal of this paradigm is to
build agents that do not just follow, but truly understand how to navigate. We
materialize this through two core contributions: first, we introduce
Compass-Data-22k, a novel 22k-trajectory dataset.Its Reinforcement Fine-Tuning
(RFT) subset provides a panoramic view of the decision landscape by annotating
all feasible actions with A* geodesic distances. Second, we design a novel
gap-aware hybrid reward function that dynamically adapts its feedback to
decision certainty, shifting between decisive signals for optimal actions and
nuanced scores to encourage exploration. Integrated into an SFT-then-RFT
recipe, our CompassNav agent is trained not to memorize static routes, but to
develop an internal ``compass'' that constantly intuits the direction to the
goal by evaluating the relative quality of all possible moves. This approach
enables our 7B agent to set a new state-of-the-art on Goal navigation
benchmarks, outperforming even larger proprietary models, and achieve robust
real-world goal navigation on a physical robot.

Result: 在多样化具身任务实验中，EFN显著提高了适应性、鲁棒性和成功率。

Conclusion: Dejavu为具身智能体在部署后持续优化行为提供了一条有前景的路径。

Abstract: Embodied agents face a fundamental limitation: once deployed in real-world
environments to perform specific tasks, they are unable to acquire new useful
knowledge to enhance task performance. In this paper, we propose a general
post-deployment learning framework called Dejavu, which employs an Experience
Feedback Network (EFN) and augments the frozen Vision-Language-Action (VLA)
policy with retrieved execution memories. EFN automatically identifies
contextually successful prior action experiences and conditions action
prediction on this retrieved guidance. We adopt reinforcement learning with
semantic similarity rewards on EFN to ensure that the predicted actions align
with past successful behaviors under current observations. During deployment,
EFN continually enriches its memory with new trajectories, enabling the agent
to exhibit "learning from experience" despite fixed weights. Experiments across
diverse embodied tasks show that EFN significantly improves adaptability,
robustness, and success rates over frozen baselines. These results highlight a
promising path toward embodied agents that continually refine their behavior
after deployment.

Method: 包含两个关键组件：(1) 接触感知运动重定向，通过将SMPL接触与机器人顶点对齐来恢复身体间协调；(2) 交互驱动运动控制器，利用交互特定奖励来强制执行协调的关键点和物理上合理的接触。

Result: 实验表明Harmanoid显著改善了交互式运动模仿，超越了在类似场景中基本失败的现有单人形框架。

Conclusion: 通过显式建模智能体间接触和交互感知动态，Harmanoid捕捉了单人形框架固有忽略的人形机器人之间的耦合行为。

Abstract: The true promise of humanoid robotics lies beyond single-agent autonomy: two
or more humanoids must engage in physically grounded, socially meaningful
whole-body interactions that echo the richness of human social interaction.
However, single-humanoid methods suffer from the isolation issue, ignoring
inter-agent dynamics and causing misaligned contacts, interpenetrations, and
unrealistic motions. To address this, we present Harmanoid , a dual-humanoid
motion imitation framework that transfers interacting human motions to two
robots while preserving both kinematic fidelity and physical realism. Harmanoid
comprises two key components: (i) contact-aware motion retargeting, which
restores inter-body coordination by aligning SMPL contacts with robot vertices,
and (ii) interaction-driven motion controller, which leverages
interaction-specific rewards to enforce coordinated keypoints and physically
plausible contacts. By explicitly modeling inter-agent contacts and
interaction-aware dynamics, Harmanoid captures the coupled behaviors between
humanoids that single-humanoid frameworks inherently overlook. Experiments
demonstrate that Harmanoid significantly improves interactive motion imitation,
surpassing existing single-humanoid frameworks that largely fail in such
scenarios.

TL;DR: 提出了不确定性驱动的前瞻循环神经网络（UF-RNN），通过前瞻模块进行内部多轨迹模拟，在不确定性高时选择性地探索动作，在门开启任务中表现出比传统随机RNN基线更好的适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决机器人在不确定状态环境（如模糊物体属性或不可预测交互）中有效操作的挑战，传统模仿学习方法依赖成功示例而忽略不确定性最显著失败场景的局限性。

Method: UF-RNN结合标准时间序列预测与主动"前瞻"模块，该模块执行多个未来轨迹的内部模拟，并优化隐藏状态以最小化预测方差，使模型能在高不确定性下选择性探索动作。

Result: 在模拟和真实机器人门开启任务中评估，即使没有明确失败演示，模型通过利用潜在空间中的自诱导混沌动力学表现出鲁棒适应性，前瞻模块引导的混沌特性在环境模糊时激发探索行为，相比传统随机RNN基线提高了成功率。

Conclusion: 将不确定性驱动的前瞻整合到模仿学习流程中，能显著增强机器人处理不可预测现实条件的能力。

Abstract: Training robots to operate effectively in environments with uncertain states,
such as ambiguous object properties or unpredictable interactions, remains a
longstanding challenge in robotics. Imitation learning methods typically rely
on successful examples and often neglect failure scenarios where uncertainty is
most pronounced. To address this limitation, we propose the Uncertainty-driven
Foresight Recurrent Neural Network (UF-RNN), a model that combines standard
time-series prediction with an active "Foresight" module. This module performs
internal simulations of multiple future trajectories and refines the hidden
state to minimize predicted variance, enabling the model to selectively explore
actions under high uncertainty. We evaluate UF-RNN on a door-opening task in
both simulation and a real-robot setting, demonstrating that, despite the
absence of explicit failure demonstrations, the model exhibits robust
adaptation by leveraging self-induced chaotic dynamics in its latent space.
When guided by the Foresight module, these chaotic properties stimulate
exploratory behaviors precisely when the environment is ambiguous, yielding
improved success rates compared to conventional stochastic RNN baselines. These
findings suggest that integrating uncertainty-driven foresight into imitation
learning pipelines can significantly enhance a robot's ability to handle
unpredictable real-world conditions.

Method: 提出A^3 RNN注意力模型，采用双向注意力架构整合预测性TD信号和显著性BU线索，在机器人操作任务中使用模仿学习进行评估。

Result: 注意力行为在训练过程中从显著性驱动探索演变为预测驱动定向，BU注意力引导TD过程，TD注意力重塑显著性感知，产生比基线更连贯可解释的注意力模式。

Conclusion: 发展性机制有助于稳健注意力形成，自组织注意力通过感知与内部预测的交互实现，符合认知科学和自由能框架原则。

Abstract: This study investigates the developmental interaction between top-down (TD)
and bottom-up (BU) visual attention in robotic learning. Our goal is to
understand how structured, human-like attentional behavior emerges through the
mutual adaptation of TD and BU mechanisms over time. To this end, we propose a
novel attention model $A^3 RNN$ that integrates predictive TD signals and
saliency-based BU cues through a bi-directional attention architecture.
  We evaluate our model in robotic manipulation tasks using imitation learning.
Experimental results show that attention behaviors evolve throughout training,
from saliency-driven exploration to prediction-driven direction. Initially, BU
attention highlights visually salient regions, which guide TD processes, while
as learning progresses, TD attention stabilizes and begins to reshape what is
perceived as salient. This trajectory reflects principles from cognitive
science and the free-energy framework, suggesting the importance of
self-organizing attention through interaction between perception and internal
prediction. Although not explicitly optimized for stability, our model exhibits
more coherent and interpretable attention patterns than baselines, supporting
the idea that developmental mechanisms contribute to robust attention
formation.

Abstract: Efficient physics simulation has significantly accelerated research progress
in robotics applications such as grasping and assembly. The advent of
GPU-accelerated simulation frameworks like Isaac Sim has particularly empowered
learning-based methods, enabling them to tackle increasingly complex tasks. The
PAL Robotics TIAGo++ Omni is a versatile mobile manipulator equipped with a
mecanum-wheeled base, allowing omnidirectional movement and a wide range of
task capabilities. However, until now, no model of the robot has been available
in Isaac Sim. In this paper, we introduce such a model, calibrated to
approximate the behavior of the real robot, with a focus on its omnidirectional
drive dynamics. We present two control models for the omnidirectional drive: a
physically accurate model that replicates real-world wheel dynamics and a
lightweight velocity-based model optimized for learning-based applications.
With these models, we introduce a learning-based calibration approach to
approximate the real robot's S-shaped velocity profile using minimal trajectory
data recordings. This simulation should allow researchers to experiment with
the robot and perform efficient learning-based control in diverse environments.

Abstract: Successful generalist Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models rely on effective

heterogeneous datasets. To facilitate and leverage the heterogeneity in rich,
diverse robotic data sources, we propose a novel Soft Prompt approach with

embodiment-specific prompts, which in unity empower VLA models with effective
exploitation of varying cross-embodiment features. Our new X-VLA, a neat
flow-matching-based VLA architecture, relies exclusively on soft-prompted
standard Transformer encoders, enjoying both scalability and simplicity.

Abstract: We present a deep reinforcement learning framework based on Soft Actor-Critic

up to 97% of target positions while avoiding obstacles. Our framework does not
rely on handcrafted trajectories or expert demonstrations.

Abstract: Chemistry, a long-standing discipline, has historically relied on manual and
often time-consuming processes. While some automation exists, the field is now
on the cusp of a significant evolution driven by the integration of robotics
and artificial intelligence (AI), giving rise to the concept of the
robochemist: a new paradigm where autonomous systems assist in designing,
executing, and analyzing experiments. Robochemists integrate mobile
manipulators, advanced perception, teleoperation, and data-driven protocols to
execute experiments with greater adaptability, reproducibility, and safety.
Rather than a fully automated replacement for human chemists, we envisioned the
robochemist as a complementary partner that works collaboratively to enhance
discovery, enabling a more efficient exploration of chemical space and
accelerating innovation in pharmaceuticals, materials science, and sustainable
manufacturing. This article traces the technologies, applications, and
challenges that define this transformation, highlighting both the opportunities
and the responsibilities that accompany the emergence of the robochemist.
Ultimately, the future of chemistry is argued to lie in a symbiotic partnership
where human intuition and expertise is amplified by robotic precision and
AI-driven insight.

Motivation: 嵌入式机器人系统面临资源限制和数值不稳定性挑战，平方根协方差滤波器能提供数值稳定性、高效内存使用和保证正半定性，但传统SRF因协方差矩阵三角结构破坏而效率低下。

Method: 提出基于Cholesky分解的SRF更新方法，充分利用系统结构保持三角结构；设计快速鲁棒的动态初始化方法，先恢复最小状态而不进行3D特征三角化，然后通过迭代SRF更新优化完整状态。

Result: 在数值研究中验证了优越的数值稳定性，在32位单精度浮点数上实现鲁棒高效性能；初始化方法在移动工作站和Jetson Nano上测试，在100ms窗口内达到高成功率。

Conclusion: sqrtVINS在各种场景中表现出强大的效率、鲁棒性和可靠性，开源实现支持未来研究和应用。

Abstract: In this paper, we develop and open-source, for the first time, a square-root
filter (SRF)-based visual-inertial navigation system (VINS), termed sqrtVINS,
which is ultra-fast, numerically stable, and capable of dynamic initialization
even under extreme conditions (i.e., extremely small time window). Despite
recent advancements in VINS, resource constraints and numerical instability on
embedded (robotic) systems with limited precision remain critical challenges. A
square-root covariance-based filter offers a promising solution by providing
numerical stability, efficient memory usage, and guaranteed positive
semi-definiteness. However, canonical SRFs suffer from inefficiencies caused by
disruptions in the triangular structure of the covariance matrix during
updates. The proposed method significantly improves VINS efficiency with a
novel Cholesky decomposition (LLT)-based SRF update, by fully exploiting the
system structure to preserve the structure. Moreover, we design a fast, robust,
dynamic initialization method, which first recovers the minimal states without
triangulating 3D features and then efficiently performs iterative SRF update to
refine the full states, enabling seamless VINS operation. The proposed
LLT-based SRF is extensively verified through numerical studies, demonstrating
superior numerical stability and achieving robust efficient performance on
32-bit single-precision floats, operating at twice the speed of
state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Our initialization method, tested on both
mobile workstations and Jetson Nano computers, achieving a high success rate of
initialization even within a 100 ms window under minimal conditions. Finally,
the proposed sqrtVINS is extensively validated across diverse scenarios,
demonstrating strong efficiency, robustness, and reliability. The full
open-source implementation is released to support future research and
applications.

Abstract: Dynamic manipulation, such as robot tossing or throwing objects, has recently
gained attention as a novel paradigm to speed up logistic operations. However,
the focus has predominantly been on the object's landing location, irrespective
of its final orientation. In this work, we present a method enabling a robot to
accurately "throw-flip" objects to a desired landing pose (position and
orientation). Conventionally, objects thrown by revolute robots suffer from
parasitic rotation, resulting in highly restricted and uncontrollable landing
poses. Our approach is based on two key design choices: first, leveraging the
impulse-momentum principle, we design a family of throwing motions that
effectively decouple the parasitic rotation, significantly expanding the
feasible set of landing poses. Second, we combine a physics-based model of free
flight with regression-based learning methods to account for unmodeled effects.
Real robot experiments demonstrate that our framework can learn to throw-flip
objects to a pose target within ($\pm$5 cm, $\pm$45 degrees) threshold in
dozens of trials. Thanks to data assimilation, incorporating projectile
dynamics reduces sample complexity by an average of 40% when throw-flipping to
unseen poses compared to end-to-end learning methods. Additionally, we show
that past knowledge on in-hand object spinning can be effectively reused,
accelerating learning by 70% when throwing a new object with a Center of Mass
(CoM) shift. A video summarizing the proposed method and the hardware
experiments is available at https://youtu.be/txYc9b1oflU.

Abstract: Achieving persistent tracking of multiple dynamic targets over a large
spatial area poses significant challenges for a single-robot system with
constrained sensing capabilities. As the robot moves to track different
targets, the ones outside the field of view accumulate uncertainty, making them
progressively harder to track. An effective path planning algorithm must manage
uncertainty over a long horizon and account for the risk of permanently losing
track of targets that remain unseen for too long. However, most existing
approaches rely on short planning horizons and assume small, bounded
environments, resulting in poor tracking performance and target loss in
large-scale scenarios. In this paper, we present a hierarchical planner for
tracking multiple moving targets with an aerial vehicle. To address the
challenge of tracking non-static targets, our method incorporates motion models
and uncertainty propagation during path execution, allowing for more informed
decision-making. We decompose the multi-target tracking task into sub-tasks of
single target search and detection, and our proposed pipeline consists a novel
low-level coverage planner that enables searching for a target in an evolving
belief area, and an estimation method to assess the likelihood of success for
each sub-task, making it possible to convert the active target tracking task to
a Markov decision process (MDP) that we solve with a tree-based algorithm to
determine the sequence of sub-tasks. We validate our approach in simulation,
demonstrating its effectiveness compared to existing planners for active target
tracking tasks, and our proposed planner outperforms existing approaches,
achieving a reduction of 11-70% in final uncertainty across different
environments.

Abstract: Quadrupedal robots exhibit a wide range of viable gaits, but generating
specific footfall sequences often requires laborious expert tuning of numerous
variables, such as touch-down and lift-off events and holonomic constraints for
each leg. This paper presents a unified reinforcement learning framework for
generating versatile quadrupedal gaits by leveraging the intrinsic symmetries
and velocity-period relationship of dynamic legged systems. We propose a
symmetry-guided reward function design that incorporates temporal,
morphological, and time-reversal symmetries. By focusing on preserved
symmetries and natural dynamics, our approach eliminates the need for
predefined trajectories, enabling smooth transitions between diverse locomotion
patterns such as trotting, bounding, half-bounding, and galloping. Implemented
on the Unitree Go2 robot, our method demonstrates robust performance across a
range of speeds in both simulations and hardware tests, significantly improving
gait adaptability without extensive reward tuning or explicit foot placement
control. This work provides insights into dynamic locomotion strategies and
underscores the crucial role of symmetries in robotic gait design.

Abstract: Galilean symmetry is the natural symmetry of inertial motion that underpins
Newtonian physics. Although rigid-body symmetry is one of the most established
and fundamental tools in robotics, there appears to be no comparable treatment
of Galilean symmetry for a robotics audience. In this paper, we present a
robotics-tailored exposition of Galilean symmetry that leverages the
community's familiarity with and understanding of rigid-body transformations
and pose representations. Our approach contrasts with common treatments in the
physics literature that introduce Galilean symmetry as a stepping stone to
Einstein's relativity. A key insight is that the Galilean matrix Lie group can
be used to describe two different pose representations, Galilean frames, that
use inertial velocity in the state definition, and extended poses, that use
coordinate velocity. We provide three examples where applying the Galilean
matrix Lie-group algebra to robotics problems is straightforward and yields
significant insights: inertial navigation above the rotating Earth, manipulator
kinematics, and sensor data fusion under temporal uncertainty. We believe that
the time is right for the robotics community to benefit from rediscovering and
extending this classical material and applying it to modern problems.

Conclusion: SuperEx为超越直接可见性的可靠建图开辟了新途径，展示了NLOS感知在机器人探索中的实用价值。

Abstract: Efficient exploration and mapping in unknown indoor environments is a
fundamental challenge, with high stakes in time-critical settings. In current
systems, robot perception remains confined to line-of-sight; occluded regions
remain unknown until physically traversed, leading to inefficient exploration
when layouts deviate from prior assumptions. In this work, we bring
non-line-of-sight (NLOS) sensing to robotic exploration. We leverage
single-photon LiDARs, which capture time-of-flight histograms that encode the
presence of hidden objects - allowing robots to look around blind corners.
Recent single-photon LiDARs have become practical and portable, enabling
deployment beyond controlled lab settings. Prior NLOS works target 3D
reconstruction in static, lab-based scenarios, and initial efforts toward
NLOS-aided navigation consider simplified geometries. We introduce SuperEx, a
framework that integrates NLOS sensing directly into the mapping-exploration
loop. SuperEx augments global map prediction with beyond-line-of-sight cues by
(i) carving empty NLOS regions from timing histograms and (ii) reconstructing
occupied structure via a two-step physics-based and data-driven approach that
leverages structural regularities. Evaluations on complex simulated maps and
the real-world KTH Floorplan dataset show a 12% gain in mapping accuracy under
< 30% coverage and improved exploration efficiency compared to line-of-sight
baselines, opening a path to reliable mapping beyond direct visibility.

Abstract: Energy-efficient and high-performance motor control remains a critical
challenge in robotics, particularly for high-dimensional continuous control
tasks with limited onboard resources. While Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)
has achieved remarkable results, its computational demands and energy
consumption limit deployment in resource-constrained environments. This paper
introduces a novel framework combining population-coded Spiking Neural Networks
(SNNs) with DRL to address these challenges. Our approach leverages the
event-driven, asynchronous computation of SNNs alongside the robust policy
optimization capabilities of DRL, achieving a balance between energy efficiency
and control performance. Central to this framework is the Population-coded
Spiking Actor Network (PopSAN), which encodes high-dimensional observations
into neuronal population activities and enables optimal policy learning through
gradient-based updates. We evaluate our method on the Isaac Gym platform using
the PixMC benchmark with complex robotic manipulation tasks. Experimental
results on the Franka robotic arm demonstrate that our approach achieves energy
savings of up to 96.10% compared to traditional Artificial Neural Networks
(ANNs) while maintaining comparable control performance. The trained SNN
policies exhibit robust finger position tracking with minimal deviation from
commanded trajectories and stable target height maintenance during
pick-and-place operations. These results position population-coded SNNs as a
promising solution for energy-efficient, high-performance robotic control in
resource-constrained applications, paving the way for scalable deployment in
real-world robotics systems.

Result: 该方法能够实现期望的动力学特性，为不同结构的机械臂提供统一的控制框架

Conclusion: 所提出的4通道双边控制方法在笛卡尔坐标系中有效实现了维度解耦和期望动力学特性，为远程控制提供了更好的操作性能

Abstract: Four-channel bilateral control is a method for achieving remote control with
force feedback and adjustment operability by synchronizing the positions and
forces of two manipulators. This is expected to significantly improve the
operability of the remote control in contact-rich tasks. Among these, 4-channel
bilateral control on the Cartesian coordinate system is advantageous owing to
its suitability for manipulators with different structures and because it
allows the dynamics in the Cartesian coordinate system to be adjusted by
adjusting the control parameters, thus achieving intuitive operability for
humans. This paper proposes a 4-channel bilateral control method that achieves
the desired dynamics by decoupling each dimension in the Cartesian coordinate
system regardless of the scaling factor.

TL;DR: 提出使用强化学习作为高层行为选择器，动态切换轨迹规划器的成本函数参数，解决了自动驾驶赛车中静态权重规划器的战术妥协问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于采样的轨迹规划器在自动驾驶赛车中广泛使用，但其行为由手动调优的静态权重成本函数控制，这在不同场景下需要战术妥协，无法达到最优性能。

Method: 使用强化学习智能体作为高层行为选择器，在运行时动态切换分析性低层轨迹规划器的成本函数参数，实现自适应行为切换。

Result: 在自动驾驶赛车模拟环境中，RL规划器实现了0%的碰撞率，同时将超车时间减少了高达60%，相比最先进的静态规划器表现更优。

Conclusion: 将强化学习作为高层选择器集成，解决了自动驾驶赛车规划器中安全性和竞争力之间的固有权衡，为更广泛的自动驾驶应用提供了自适应且可解释的运动规划路径。

Abstract: Sampling-based trajectory planners are widely used for agile autonomous
driving due to their ability to generate fast, smooth, and kinodynamically
feasible trajectories. However, their behavior is often governed by a cost
function with manually tuned, static weights, which forces a tactical
compromise that is suboptimal across the wide range of scenarios encountered in
a race. To address this shortcoming, we propose using a Reinforcement Learning
(RL) agent as a high-level behavioral selector that dynamically switches the
cost function parameters of an analytical, low-level trajectory planner during
runtime. We show the effectiveness of our approach in simulation in an
autonomous racing environment where our RL-based planner achieved 0% collision
rate while reducing overtaking time by up to 60% compared to state-of-the-art
static planners. Our new agent now dynamically switches between aggressive and
conservative behaviors, enabling interactive maneuvers unattainable with static
configurations. These results demonstrate that integrating reinforcement
learning as a high-level selector resolves the inherent trade-off between
safety and competitiveness in autonomous racing planners. The proposed
methodology offers a pathway toward adaptive yet interpretable motion planning
for broader autonomous driving applications.

Abstract: Improving robotic navigation is critical for extending exploration range and
enhancing operational efficiency. Vision-based navigation relying on
traditional CCD or CMOS cameras faces major challenges when complex

We detail the operating principles and performance characteristics of SPAD
cameras, assess their advantages and limitations in addressing key perception
challenges of upcoming exploration missions to the Moon, and benchmark their
performance under representative illumination conditions.

Conclusion: 通过验证这种端到端神经启发方法的可行性，SpikeGrasp为未来实现自然界中流畅高效操作能力的系统铺平了道路，特别适用于动态物体。

Abstract: Most robotic grasping systems rely on converting sensor data into explicit 3D
point clouds, which is a computational step not found in biological
intelligence. This paper explores a fundamentally different, neuro-inspired
paradigm for 6-DoF grasp detection. We introduce SpikeGrasp, a framework that
mimics the biological visuomotor pathway, processing raw, asynchronous events
from stereo spike cameras, similarly to retinas, to directly infer grasp poses.
Our model fuses these stereo spike streams and uses a recurrent spiking neural
network, analogous to high-level visual processing, to iteratively refine grasp
hypotheses without ever reconstructing a point cloud. To validate this
approach, we built a large-scale synthetic benchmark dataset. Experiments show
that SpikeGrasp surpasses traditional point-cloud-based baselines, especially
in cluttered and textureless scenes, and demonstrates remarkable data
efficiency. By establishing the viability of this end-to-end, neuro-inspired
approach, SpikeGrasp paves the way for future systems capable of the fluid and
efficient manipulation seen in nature, particularly for dynamic objects.

Conclusion: RoboSimGS是弥合仿真到真实差距的强大且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: The scalability of robotic learning is fundamentally bottlenecked by the
significant cost and labor of real-world data collection. While simulated data
offers a scalable alternative, it often fails to generalize to the real world
due to significant gaps in visual appearance, physical properties, and object
interactions. To address this, we propose RoboSimGS, a novel Real2Sim2Real
framework that converts multi-view real-world images into scalable,
high-fidelity, and physically interactive simulation environments for robotic
manipulation. Our approach reconstructs scenes using a hybrid representation:
3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) captures the photorealistic appearance of the
environment, while mesh primitives for interactive objects ensure accurate
physics simulation. Crucially, we pioneer the use of a Multi-modal Large
Language Model (MLLM) to automate the creation of physically plausible,
articulated assets. The MLLM analyzes visual data to infer not only physical
properties (e.g., density, stiffness) but also complex kinematic structures
(e.g., hinges, sliding rails) of objects. We demonstrate that policies trained
entirely on data generated by RoboSimGS achieve successful zero-shot
sim-to-real transfer across a diverse set of real-world manipulation tasks.
Furthermore, data from RoboSimGS significantly enhances the performance and
generalization capabilities of SOTA methods. Our results validate RoboSimGS as
a powerful and scalable solution for bridging the sim-to-real gap.

Abstract: Building generalist robot policies that can handle diverse tasks in
open-ended environments is a central challenge in robotics. To leverage
knowledge from large-scale pretraining, prior work has typically built
generalist policies either on top of vision-language understanding models
(VLMs) or generative models. However, both semantic understanding from
vision-language pretraining and visual dynamics modeling from visual-generation
pretraining are crucial for embodied robots. Recent unified models of
generation and understanding have demonstrated strong capabilities in both
comprehension and generation through large-scale pretraining. We posit that
robotic policy learning can likewise benefit from the combined strengths of
understanding, planning and continuous future representation learning. Building
on this insight, we introduce UniCoD, which acquires the ability to dynamically
model high-dimensional visual features through pretraining on over 1M
internet-scale instructional manipulation videos. Subsequently, UniCoD is
fine-tuned on data collected from the robot embodiment, enabling the learning
of mappings from predictive representations to action tokens. Extensive
experiments show our approach consistently outperforms baseline methods in
terms of 9\% and 12\% across simulation environments and real-world
out-of-distribution tasks.

Abstract: A new AUV mission planning and execution software has been tested on AUV
Sentry. Dubbed DINOS-R, it draws inspiration from cognitive architectures and
AUV control systems to replace the legacy MC architecture. Unlike these
existing architectures, however, DINOS-R is built from the ground-up to unify
symbolic decision making (for understandable, repeatable, provable behavior)
with machine learning techniques and reactive behaviors, for field-readiness
across oceanographic platforms. Implemented primarily in Python3, DINOS-R is
extensible, modular, and reusable, with an emphasis on non-expert use as well
as growth for future research in oceanography and robot algorithms. Mission
specification is flexible, and can be specified declaratively. Behavior
specification is similarly flexible, supporting simultaneous use of real-time
task planning and hard-coded user specified plans. These features were
demonstrated in the field on Sentry, in addition to a variety of simulated
cases. These results are discussed, and future work is outlined.

Motivation: 现有方法缺乏生成可控多样化轨迹的方案，而随机多样化的轨迹对于自动驾驶安全规划不够有用。人类行为具有内在不确定性和多模态特性，需要可控的语义多样化预测。

Method: 提出PrefCVAE框架，使用弱标记偏好对来为CVAE的潜在变量赋予语义属性（如平均速度），从而实现可控的多样化轨迹生成。

Result: PrefCVAE能够在不降低基线准确性的情况下，生成可控且语义有意义的预测结果。偏好监督被证明是增强基于采样的生成模型的有效且成本低廉的方法。

Conclusion: PrefCVAE通过偏好监督成功实现了可控的多样化轨迹预测，为自动驾驶安全规划提供了更实用的轨迹生成方案。

Abstract: Deep generative models such as conditional variational autoencoders (CVAEs)
have shown great promise for predicting trajectories of surrounding agents in
autonomous vehicle planning. State-of-the-art models have achieved remarkable
accuracy in such prediction tasks. Besides accuracy, diversity is also crucial
for safe planning because human behaviors are inherently uncertain and
multimodal. However, existing methods generally lack a scheme to generate
controllably diverse trajectories, which is arguably more useful than randomly
diversified trajectories, to the end of safe planning. To address this, we
propose PrefCVAE, an augmented CVAE framework that uses weakly labeled
preference pairs to imbue latent variables with semantic attributes. Using
average velocity as an example attribute, we demonstrate that PrefCVAE enables
controllable, semantically meaningful predictions without degrading baseline
accuracy. Our results show the effectiveness of preference supervision as a
cost-effective way to enhance sampling-based generative models.

TL;DR: ROGER是一种在线自适应奖励权重调整方法，通过体化调节机制在机器人运动学习过程中动态调整奖励权重增益，确保约束满足并提高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器人运动学习方法严重依赖离线选择奖励权重增益，无法保证训练过程中的约束满足（即避免约束违反）。

Method: 提出ROGER方法，基于在体交互过程中接收到的惩罚在线调整奖励权重增益。当学习接近约束阈值时，正负奖励增益比自动降低以避免违反；在安全状态下则提高该比值以优先考虑性能。

Result: 在60公斤四足机器人上，ROGER实现了近乎零约束违反，主要奖励比最先进技术高出50%。在MuJoCo连续运动基准测试中，性能提升达100%，扭矩使用和方向偏差减少60%。真实世界四足机器人从零开始学习运动，1小时内无摔倒。

Conclusion: 该工作为约束满足的真实世界持续机器人运动学习做出贡献，简化了奖励权重增益调整，有助于物理机器人和真实世界学习的发展。

Abstract: Existing robot locomotion learning techniques rely heavily on the offline
selection of proper reward weighting gains and cannot guarantee constraint
satisfaction (i.e., constraint violation) during training. Thus, this work aims
to address both issues by proposing Reward-Oriented Gains via Embodied
Regulation (ROGER), which adapts reward-weighting gains online based on
penalties received throughout the embodied interaction process. The ratio
between the positive reward (primary reward) and negative reward (penalty)
gains is automatically reduced as the learning approaches the constraint
thresholds to avoid violation. Conversely, the ratio is increased when learning
is in safe states to prioritize performance. With a 60-kg quadruped robot,
ROGER achieved near-zero constraint violation throughout multiple learning
trials. It also achieved up to 50% more primary reward than the equivalent
state-of-the-art techniques. In MuJoCo continuous locomotion benchmarks,
including a single-leg hopper, ROGER exhibited comparable or up to 100% higher
performance and 60% less torque usage and orientation deviation compared to
those trained with the default reward function. Finally, real-world locomotion
learning of a physical quadruped robot was achieved from scratch within one
hour without any falls. Therefore, this work contributes to
constraint-satisfying real-world continual robot locomotion learning and
simplifies reward weighting gain tuning, potentially facilitating the
development of physical robots and those that learn in the real world.

Conclusion: USD是LLM机器人任务的有效通用表示，能够支持复杂的场景理解和规划任务。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can help robots reason about abstract task
specifications. This requires augmenting classical representations of the
environment used by robots with natural language-based priors. There are a
number of existing approaches to doing so, but they are tailored to specific
tasks, e.g., visual-language models for navigation, language-guided neural
radiance fields for mapping, etc. This paper argues that the Universal Scene
Description (USD) language is an effective and general representation of
geometric, photometric and semantic information in the environment for
LLM-based robotics tasks. Our argument is simple: a USD is an XML-based scene
graph, readable by LLMs and humans alike, and rich enough to support
essentially any task -- Pixar developed this language to store assets, scenes
and even movies. We demonstrate a ``Real to USD'' system using a Unitree Go2
quadruped robot carrying LiDAR and a RGB camera that (i) builds an explicit USD
representation of indoor environments with diverse objects and challenging
settings with lots of glass, and (ii) parses the USD using Google's Gemini to
demonstrate scene understanding, complex inferences, and planning. We also
study different aspects of this system in simulated warehouse and hospital
settings using Nvidia's Issac Sim. Code is available at

Abstract: We present a comprehensive two-layer Voronoi coverage control approach for
coordinating hybrid aerial-ground robot teams in hazardous material emergency
response scenarios. Traditional Voronoi coverage control methods face three
critical limitations in emergency contexts: heterogeneous agent capabilities
with vastly different velocities, clustered initial deployment configurations,
and urgent time constraints requiring rapid response rather than eventual
convergence. Our method addresses these challenges through a decoupled
two-layer architecture that separately optimizes aerial and ground robot
positioning, with aerial agents delivering ground sensors via airdrop to
high-priority locations. We provide detailed implementation of bounded Voronoi
cell computation, efficient numerical integration techniques for
importance-weighted centroids, and robust control strategies that prevent agent
trapping. Simulation results demonstrate an 88% reduction in response time,
achieving target sensor coverage (18.5% of initial sensor loss) in 25 seconds
compared to 220 seconds for ground-only deployment. Complete implementation

Conclusion: 提供了根据操作条件（包括可用硬件、所需触觉信息和具体任务）选择适当数据表示的讨论和指南。

Abstract: Robotic tactile perception is a complex process involving several
computational steps performed at different levels. Tactile information is
shaped by the interplay of robot actions, the mechanical properties of its
body, and the software that processes the data. In this respect, high-level
computation, required to process and extract information, is commonly performed
by adapting existing techniques from other domains, such as computer vision,
which expects input data to be properly structured. Therefore, it is necessary
to transform tactile sensor data to match a specific data structure. This
operation directly affects the tactile information encoded and, as a
consequence, the task execution. This survey aims to address this specific
aspect of the tactile perception pipeline, namely Data Representation. The
paper first clearly defines its contributions to the perception pipeline and
then reviews how previous studies have dealt with the problem of representing
tactile information, investigating the relationships among hardware,
representations, and high-level computation methods. The analysis has led to
the identification of six structures commonly used in the literature to
represent data. The manuscript provides discussions and guidelines for properly
selecting a representation depending on operating conditions, including the
available hardware, the tactile information required to be encoded, and the
task at hand.

Abstract: This paper presents a method for detecting and localizing contact along robot
legs using distributed joint torque sensors and a single hip-mounted
force-torque (FT) sensor using a generalized momentum-based observer framework.
We designed a low-cost strain-gauge-based joint torque sensor that can be
installed on every joint to provide direct torque measurements, eliminating the
need for complex friction models and providing more accurate torque readings
than estimation based on motor current. Simulation studies on a floating-based
2-DoF robot leg verified that the proposed framework accurately recovers
contact force and location along the thigh and shin links. Through a
calibration procedure, our torque sensor achieved an average 96.4% accuracy
relative to ground truth measurements. Building upon the torque sensor, we
performed hardware experiments on a 2-DoF manipulator, which showed
sub-centimeter contact localization accuracy and force errors below 0.2 N.

*Tingxuan Leng,Yushi Wang,Tinglong Zheng,Changsheng Luo,Mingguo Zhao*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种偏好条件多目标强化学习框架，用于平衡人形机器人导航命令跟踪和外部力顺应性，实现可部署的偏好条件人形运动控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RL方法主要强调鲁棒性，导致策略抵抗外部力但缺乏顺应性，这对本质上不稳定的人形机器人特别具有挑战性。

Method: 将人形运动建模为多目标优化问题，引入偏好条件多目标RL框架，通过速度阻力因子建模外部力，使用编码器-解码器结构从可部署观测中推断特权特征。

Result: 在仿真和真实人形机器人实验中验证，该框架不仅提高了适应性和收敛性，还实现了可部署的偏好条件人形运动。

Conclusion: 该工作成功解决了人形机器人在命令跟踪和外部力顺应性之间的平衡问题，为实际部署提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Humanoid locomotion requires not only accurate command tracking for
navigation but also compliant responses to external forces during human
interaction. Despite significant progress, existing RL approaches mainly
emphasize robustness, yielding policies that resist external forces but lack
compliance-particularly challenging for inherently unstable humanoids. In this
work, we address this by formulating humanoid locomotion as a multi-objective
optimization problem that balances command tracking and external force
compliance. We introduce a preference-conditioned multi-objective RL (MORL)
framework that integrates rigid command following and compliant behaviors
within a single omnidirectional locomotion policy. External forces are modeled
via velocity-resistance factor for consistent reward design, and training
leverages an encoder-decoder structure that infers task-relevant privileged
features from deployable observations. We validate our approach in both
simulation and real-world experiments on a humanoid robot. Experimental results
indicate that our framework not only improves adaptability and convergence over
standard pipelines, but also realizes deployable preference-conditioned
humanoid locomotion.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: GRIP是一个统一的模块化框架，用于机器人在动态、杂乱和语义复杂环境中的导航，通过集成感知、符号推理和空间规划来提高适应性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖静态先验或有限记忆，在部分可观测性和语义模糊性下限制了适应性。需要开发能够处理多样化布局和对象类别的导航系统。

Method: GRIP框架包含三个变体：GRIP-L（轻量级）用于符号导航，GRIP-F（完整版）支持多跳锚点链和LLM自省，GRIP-R（现实世界）支持物理机器人部署。集成了动态2D网格构建、开放词汇对象接地、共现感知符号规划和混合策略执行。

Result: 在AI2-THOR和RoboTHOR基准测试中，GRIP在长时程任务上实现了高达9.6%的成功率提升和超过2倍的路径效率改进（SPL和SAE）。现实世界部署验证了在传感器噪声和环境变化下的泛化能力。

Conclusion: GRIP作为一个稳健、可扩展和可解释的框架，成功连接了仿真和现实世界导航，展示了在复杂环境中的优越性能。

Abstract: Robots navigating dynamic, cluttered, and semantically complex environments
must integrate perception, symbolic reasoning, and spatial planning to
generalize across diverse layouts and object categories. Existing methods often
rely on static priors or limited memory, constraining adaptability under
partial observability and semantic ambiguity. We present GRIP, Grid-based Relay
with Intermediate Planning, a unified, modular framework with three scalable
variants: GRIP-L (Lightweight), optimized for symbolic navigation via semantic
occupancy grids; GRIP-F (Full), supporting multi-hop anchor chaining and
LLM-based introspection; and GRIP-R (Real-World), enabling physical robot
deployment under perceptual uncertainty. GRIP integrates dynamic 2D grid
construction, open-vocabulary object grounding, co-occurrence-aware symbolic
planning, and hybrid policy execution using behavioral cloning, D* search, and
grid-conditioned control. Empirical results on AI2-THOR and RoboTHOR benchmarks
show that GRIP achieves up to 9.6% higher success rates and over $2\times$
improvement in path efficiency (SPL and SAE) on long-horizon tasks. Qualitative
analyses reveal interpretable symbolic plans in ambiguous scenes. Real-world
deployment on a Jetbot further validates GRIP's generalization under sensor
noise and environmental variation. These results position GRIP as a robust,
scalable, and explainable framework bridging simulation and real-world
navigation.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出QuayPoints框架，将全局最优性信息传递给局部规划器，使自主赛车在偏离最优线路时仍能做出明智决策，提升超车性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准自主赛车流水线中，全局规划器的优化信息在传递到局部规划器时被简化为稀疏路径点，导致局部规划器缺乏全局上下文，只能做出反应性决策。

Method: 引入QuayPoints框架，通过识别偏离最优赛道线会显著影响最优性的关键区域，将全局时间最优性信息传递给局部规划器。

Result: 将QuayPoints集成到现有规划器中，在四个不同赛道上测试，能够持续超越以自我车辆75%速度行驶的对手。

Conclusion: QuayPoints框架有效保留了全局知识，使局部规划器在偏离最优线路时能做出更明智的全局决策，显著提升自主赛车性能。

Abstract: Autonomous racing requires tight integration between perception, planning and
control to minimize latency as well as timely decision making. A standard
autonomy pipeline comprising a global planner, local planner, and controller
loses information as the higher-level racing context is sequentially propagated
downstream into specific task-oriented context. In particular, the global
planner's understanding of optimality is typically reduced to a sparse set of
waypoints, leaving the local planner to make reactive decisions with limited
context. This paper investigates whether additional global insights,
specifically time-optimality information, can be meaningfully passed to the
local planner to improve downstream decisions. We introduce a framework that
preserves essential global knowledge and conveys it to the local planner
through QuayPoints regions where deviations from the optimal raceline result in
significant compromises to optimality. QuayPoints enable local planners to make
more informed global decisions when deviating from the raceline, such as during
strategic overtaking. To demonstrate this, we integrate QuayPoints into an
existing planner and show that it consistently overtakes opponents traveling at
up to 75% of the ego vehicle's speed across four distinct race tracks.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于驾驶员轨迹跟踪能力的自适应控制权转移策略，通过合作微分博弈模型动态调整控制权限，相比传统固定时间转移策略能减少轨迹偏差和驾驶员控制负担。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动驾驶系统控制权转移策略基于固定时间，无法适应驾驶员实时性能变化，在驾驶员脱离环路(OOTL)情况下会导致反应时间增加和准备度降低。

Method: 将共享控制建模为合作微分游戏，通过时变目标函数调节控制权限而非直接混合控制扭矩；引入驾驶员特定状态跟踪矩阵，使转移过程符合个体控制偏好；使用累积轨迹误差指标评估多种转移策略。

Result: 在ISO标准换道场景的人机回路控制实验中，自适应转移策略相比传统策略减少了轨迹偏差和驾驶员控制负担；实时基于偏差连续调整控制权限增强了车辆稳定性。

Conclusion: 自适应控制权转移策略能更有效地应对驾驶员实时性能变化，提高接管过程的自然性和安全性，同时降低驾驶员负担。

Abstract: The transition of control from autonomous systems to human drivers is
critical in automated driving systems, particularly due to the out-of-the-loop
(OOTL) circumstances that reduce driver readiness and increase reaction times.
Existing takeover strategies are based on fixed time-based transitions, which
fail to account for real-time driver performance variations. This paper
proposes an adaptive transition strategy that dynamically adjusts the control
authority based on both the time and tracking ability of the driver trajectory.
Shared control is modeled as a cooperative differential game, where control
authority is modulated through time-varying objective functions instead of
blending control torques directly. To ensure a more natural takeover, a
driver-specific state-tracking matrix is introduced, allowing the transition to
align with individual control preferences. Multiple transition strategies are
evaluated using a cumulative trajectory error metric. Human-in-the-loop control
scenarios of the standardized ISO lane change maneuvers demonstrate that
adaptive transitions reduce trajectory deviations and driver control effort
compared to conventional strategies. Experiments also confirm that continuously
adjusting control authority based on real-time deviations enhances vehicle
stability while reducing driver effort during takeover.

Abstract: Embodied intelligence has witnessed remarkable progress in recent years,
driven by advances in computer vision, natural language processing, and the
rise of large-scale multimodal models. Among its core challenges, robot
manipulation stands out as a fundamental yet intricate problem, requiring the
seamless integration of perception, planning, and control to enable interaction
within diverse and unstructured environments. This survey presents a
comprehensive overview of robotic manipulation, encompassing foundational
background, task-organized benchmarks and datasets, and a unified taxonomy of
existing methods. We extend the classical division between high-level planning
and low-level control by broadening high-level planning to include language,
code, motion, affordance, and 3D representations, while introducing a new
taxonomy of low-level learning-based control grounded in training paradigms
such as input modeling, latent learning, and policy learning. Furthermore, we
provide the first dedicated taxonomy of key bottlenecks, focusing on data
collection, utilization, and generalization, and conclude with an extensive
review of real-world applications. Compared with prior surveys, our work offers
both a broader scope and deeper insight, serving as an accessible roadmap for

Motivation: 传统语言引导机器人系统将空间推理简化为离散点，使其对感知噪声和语义模糊性非常脆弱，需要更鲁棒的空间表示方法。

Method: 提出RoboMAP框架，使用连续、自适应的affordance热图来表示空间目标，这种密集表示能够捕捉空间grounding中的不确定性。

Result: 在大多数grounding基准测试中超越之前的最先进方法，速度提升高达50倍，在真实世界操作中达到82%的成功率，并在模拟和物理实验中展示出鲁棒性能和强大的零样本导航泛化能力。

Conclusion: RoboMAP通过连续affordance热图表示显著提高了任务成功率和可解释性，为语言引导机器人系统提供了更鲁棒的空间推理解决方案。

Abstract: Many language-guided robotic systems rely on collapsing spatial reasoning
into discrete points, making them brittle to perceptual noise and semantic
ambiguity. To address this challenge, we propose RoboMAP, a framework that
represents spatial targets as continuous, adaptive affordance heatmaps. This
dense representation captures the uncertainty in spatial grounding and provides
richer information for downstream policies, thereby significantly enhancing
task success and interpretability. RoboMAP surpasses the previous
state-of-the-art on a majority of grounding benchmarks with up to a 50x speed
improvement, and achieves an 82\% success rate in real-world manipulation.
Across extensive simulated and physical experiments, it demonstrates robust
performance and shows strong zero-shot generalization to navigation. More

Motivation: 传统强化学习方法在自动驾驶中难以平衡安全性、效率和适应性，主要关注奖励最大化而缺乏明确的风险和安全约束建模

Method: 多级博弈论世界模型预测周围车辆交互行为和风险，自适应滚动时域根据预测不确定性动态调整，不确定性感知屏障机制灵活调节安全边界，专门风险建模方法捕捉认知和随机不确定性

Result: 在多样化安全关键交通场景中显著优于现有基准方法（包括人类驾驶员），在成功率、碰撞和违规减少、驾驶效率方面表现优异

Conclusion: GTR2L框架通过博弈论风险建模和不确定性感知机制，有效提升了自动驾驶在复杂动态环境中的安全性和适应性

Abstract: Ensuring safety in autonomous driving (AD) remains a significant challenge,
especially in highly dynamic and complex traffic environments where diverse
agents interact and unexpected hazards frequently emerge. Traditional
reinforcement learning (RL) methods often struggle to balance safety,
efficiency, and adaptability, as they primarily focus on reward maximization
without explicitly modeling risk or safety constraints. To address these
limitations, this study proposes a novel game-theoretic risk-shaped RL (GTR2L)
framework for safe AD. GTR2L incorporates a multi-level game-theoretic world
model that jointly predicts the interactive behaviors of surrounding vehicles
and their associated risks, along with an adaptive rollout horizon that adjusts
dynamically based on predictive uncertainty. Furthermore, an uncertainty-aware
barrier mechanism enables flexible modulation of safety boundaries. A dedicated
risk modeling approach is also proposed, explicitly capturing both epistemic
and aleatoric uncertainty to guide constrained policy optimization and enhance
decision-making in complex environments. Extensive evaluations across diverse
and safety-critical traffic scenarios show that GTR2L significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines, including human drivers, in terms of success rate,
collision and violation reduction, and driving efficiency. The code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决VLA模型性能提升依赖训练数据和模型规模扩展的问题，这种方法在机器人领域成本过高且受限于数据收集成本。

Method: 使用机器人过程奖励模型作为测试时验证器，为候选动作分配过程奖励并预测动作空间方向，通过方向引导采样策略和共享感知缓存来高效生成和选择候选动作。

Conclusion: RoVer提供了一个通用、即插即用的测试时扩展框架，通过过程奖励模型和高效采样策略显著提升了VLA模型的性能。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have become a prominent paradigm for
embodied intelligence, yet further performance improvements typically rely on
scaling up training data and model size -- an approach that is prohibitively
expensive for robotics and fundamentally limited by data collection costs.We
address this limitation with $\mathbf{RoVer}$, an embodied test-time scaling
framework that uses a $\mathbf{Ro}$bot Process Reward Model (PRM) as a
Test-Time $\mathbf{Ver}$ifier to enhance the capabilities of existing VLA
models without modifying their architectures or weights. Specifically, RoVer
(i) assigns scalar-based process rewards to evaluate the reliability of
candidate actions, and (ii) predicts an action-space direction for candidate
expansion/refinement. During inference, RoVer generates multiple candidate
actions concurrently from the base policy, expands them along PRM-predicted
directions, and then scores all candidates with PRM to select the optimal
action for execution. Notably, by caching shared perception features, it can
amortize perception cost and evaluate more candidates under the same test-time
computational budget. Essentially, our approach effectively transforms
available computing resources into better action decision-making, realizing the
benefits of test-time scaling without extra training overhead. Our
contributions are threefold: (1) a general, plug-and-play test-time scaling
framework for VLAs; (2) a PRM that jointly provides scalar process rewards and
an action-space direction to guide exploration; and (3) an efficient
direction-guided sampling strategy that leverages a shared perception cache to
enable scalable candidate generation and selection during inference.

Result: 在真实室内环境中进行的广泛实验表明，该方法在磁干扰条件下能提供精确的航向估计

Conclusion: AMO-HEAD方法有效解决了无人机在磁干扰环境下的航向估计问题

Abstract: Accurate and robust heading estimation is crucial for unmanned aerial
vehicles (UAVs) when conducting indoor inspection tasks. However, the cluttered
nature of indoor environments often introduces severe magnetic disturbances,
which can significantly degrade heading accuracy. To address this challenge,
this paper presents an Adaptive MARG-Only Heading (AMO-HEAD) estimation
approach for UAVs operating in magnetically disturbed environments. AMO-HEAD is
a lightweight and computationally efficient Extended Kalman Filter (EKF)
framework that leverages inertial and magnetic sensors to achieve reliable
heading estimation. In the proposed approach, gyroscope angular rate
measurements are integrated to propagate the quaternion state, which is
subsequently corrected using accelerometer and magnetometer data. The corrected
quaternion is then used to compute the UAV's heading. An adaptive process noise
covariance method is introduced to model and compensate for gyroscope
measurement noise, bias drift, and discretization errors arising from the Euler
method integration. To mitigate the effects of external magnetic disturbances,
a scaling factor is applied based on real-time magnetic deviation detection. A
theoretical observability analysis of the proposed AMO-HEAD is performed using
the Lie derivative. Extensive experiments were conducted in real world indoor
environments with customized UAV platforms. The results demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in providing precise heading estimation
under magnetically disturbed conditions.

Abstract: Priors are vital for planning under partial observability, yet difficult to
obtain in practice. We present a sampling-based pipeline that leverages
large-scale pretrained generative models to produce probabilistic priors
capturing environmental uncertainty and spatio-semantic relationships in a
zero-shot manner. Conditioned on partial observations, the pipeline recovers
complete RGB-D point cloud samples with occupancy and target semantics,
formulated to be directly useful in configuration-space planning. We establish
a Matterport3D benchmark of rooms partially visible through doorways, where a
robot must navigate to an unobserved target object. Effective priors for this
setting must represent both occupancy and target-location uncertainty in
unobserved regions. Experiments show that our approach recovers commonsense
spatial semantics consistent with ground truth, yielding diverse, clean 3D
point clouds usable in motion planning, highlight the promise of generative
models as a rich source of priors for robotic planning.

Motivation: 基于模拟的学习在接触密集型任务中达到约80%的成功率，但这达不到工业标准且策略链化脆弱。主要限制是策略在不同初始条件下的性能方差过大。

Method: 提出Refinery框架：使用贝叶斯优化指导的策略微调来改进个体策略，部署时使用高斯混合模型采样选择最大化执行成功率的初始化条件。

Conclusion: Refinery框架有效缩小了模拟学习与工业标准之间的性能差距，提高了策略的鲁棒性，支持长视野的多部件装配任务。

Abstract: Simulation-based learning has enabled policies for precise, contact-rich
tasks (e.g., robotic assembly) to reach high success rates (~80%) under high
levels of observation noise and control error. Although such performance may be
sufficient for research applications, it falls short of industry standards and
makes policy chaining exceptionally brittle. A key limitation is the high
variance in individual policy performance across diverse initial conditions. We
introduce Refinery, an effective framework that bridges this performance gap,
robustifying policy performance across initial conditions. We propose Bayesian
Optimization-guided fine-tuning to improve individual policies, and Gaussian
Mixture Model-based sampling during deployment to select initializations that
maximize execution success. Using Refinery, we improve mean success rates by
10.98% over state-of-the-art methods in simulation-based learning for robotic
assembly, reaching 91.51% in simulation and comparable performance in the real
world. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these fine-tuned policies can be
chained to accomplish long-horizon, multi-part
assembly$\unicode{x2013}$successfully assembling up to 8 parts without
requiring explicit multi-step training.

Abstract: Most robotic grasping methods are typically designed for single gripper
types, which limits their applicability in real-world scenarios requiring
diverse end-effectors. We propose XGrasp, a real-time gripper-aware grasp
detection framework that efficiently handles multiple gripper configurations.
The proposed method addresses data scarcity by systematically augmenting
existing datasets with multi-gripper annotations. XGrasp employs a hierarchical
two-stage architecture. In the first stage, a Grasp Point Predictor (GPP)
identifies optimal locations using global scene information and gripper
specifications. In the second stage, an Angle-Width Predictor (AWP) refines the
grasp angle and width using local features. Contrastive learning in the AWP
module enables zero-shot generalization to unseen grippers by learning
fundamental grasping characteristics. The modular framework integrates
seamlessly with vision foundation models, providing pathways for future
vision-language capabilities. The experimental results demonstrate competitive
grasp success rates across various gripper types, while achieving substantial
improvements in inference speed compared to existing gripper-aware methods.

Conclusion: DRLACP框架能有效处理自主协同规划中的各种不确定性，提高多车辆交互的有效性和安全性。

Abstract: In future intelligent transportation systems, autonomous cooperative planning
(ACP), becomes a promising technique to increase the effectiveness and security
of multi-vehicle interactions. However, multiple uncertainties cannot be fully
addressed for existing ACP strategies, e.g. perception, planning, and
communication uncertainties. To address these, a novel deep reinforcement
learning-based autonomous cooperative planning (DRLACP) framework is proposed
to tackle various uncertainties on cooperative motion planning schemes.
Specifically, the soft actor-critic (SAC) with the implementation of gate
recurrent units (GRUs) is adopted to learn the deterministic optimal
time-varying actions with imperfect state information occurred by planning,
communication, and perception uncertainties. In addition, the real-time actions
of autonomous vehicles (AVs) are demonstrated via the Car Learning to Act
(CARLA) simulation platform. Evaluation results show that the proposed DRLACP
learns and performs cooperative planning effectively, which outperforms other
baseline methods under different scenarios with imperfect AV state information.

Abstract: Deploying humanoid robots to interact with real-world environments--such as
carrying objects or sitting on chairs--requires generalizable, lifelike motions
and robust scene perception. Although prior approaches have advanced each
capability individually, combining them in a unified system is still an ongoing
challenge. In this work, we present a physical-world humanoid-scene interaction
system, PhysHSI, that enables humanoids to autonomously perform diverse
interaction tasks while maintaining natural and lifelike behaviors. PhysHSI
comprises a simulation training pipeline and a real-world deployment system. In
simulation, we adopt adversarial motion prior-based policy learning to imitate
natural humanoid-scene interaction data across diverse scenarios, achieving
both generalization and lifelike behaviors. For real-world deployment, we
introduce a coarse-to-fine object localization module that combines LiDAR and
camera inputs to provide continuous and robust scene perception. We validate
PhysHSI on four representative interactive tasks--box carrying, sitting, lying,
and standing up--in both simulation and real-world settings, demonstrating
consistently high success rates, strong generalization across diverse task
goals, and natural motion patterns.

Abstract: Modeling interactive driving behaviors in complex scenarios remains a
fundamental challenge for autonomous driving planning. Learning-based
approaches attempt to address this challenge with advanced generative models,
removing the dependency on over-engineered architectures for representation
fusion. However, brute-force implementation by simply stacking transformer
blocks lacks a dedicated mechanism for modeling interactive behaviors that are
common in real driving scenarios. The scarcity of interactive driving data
further exacerbates this problem, leaving conventional imitation learning
methods ill-equipped to capture high-value interactive behaviors. We propose
Flow Planner, which tackles these problems through coordinated innovations in
data modeling, model architecture, and learning scheme. Specifically, we first
introduce fine-grained trajectory tokenization, which decomposes the trajectory
into overlapping segments to decrease the complexity of whole trajectory
modeling. With a sophisticatedly designed architecture, we achieve efficient
temporal and spatial fusion of planning and scene information, to better
capture interactive behaviors. In addition, the framework incorporates flow
matching with classifier-free guidance for multi-modal behavior generation,
which dynamically reweights agent interactions during inference to maintain
coherent response strategies, providing a critical boost for interactive
scenario understanding. Experimental results on the large-scale nuPlan dataset
and challenging interactive interPlan dataset demonstrate that Flow Planner
achieves state-of-the-art performance among learning-based approaches while
effectively modeling interactive behaviors in complex driving scenarios.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于折纸启发的气动执行器软外骨骼康复系统，使用深度Koopman网络建模人机交互动力学，并结合模型预测控制实现膝关节康复训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统刚性外骨骼笨重且穿戴不便，需要额外的柔顺控制保证安全；软外骨骼虽然穿戴舒适且具有固有柔顺性，但其复杂的非线性人机交互动力学给控制带来挑战。

Conclusion: 该方法为软康复机器人提供了一种新的控制框架，通过深度Koopman建模和模型预测控制实现了更好的人机交互性能。

Abstract: Effective rehabilitation methods are essential for the recovery of lower limb
dysfunction caused by stroke. Nowadays, robotic exoskeletons have shown great
potentials in rehabilitation. Nevertheless, traditional rigid exoskeletons are
usually heavy and need a lot of work to help the patients to put them on.
Moreover, it also requires extra compliance control to guarantee the safety. In
contrast, soft exoskeletons are easy and comfortable to wear and have intrinsic
compliance, but their complex nonlinear human-robot interaction dynamics would
pose significant challenges for control. In this work, based on the pneumatic
actuators inspired by origami, we design a rehabilitation exoskeleton for knee
that is easy and comfortable to wear. To guarantee the control performance and
enable a nice human-robot interaction, we first use Deep Koopman Network to
model the human-robot interaction dynamics. In particular, by viewing the
electromyography (EMG) signals and the duty cycle of the PWM wave that controls
the pneumatic robot's valves and pump as the inputs, the linear Koopman model
accurately captures the complex human-robot interaction dynamics. Next, based
on the obtained Koopman model, we further use Model Predictive Control (MPC) to
control the soft robot and help the user to do rehabilitation training in
real-time. The goal of the rehabilitation training is to track a given
reference signal shown on the screen. Experiments show that by integrating the
EMG signals into the Koopman model, we have improved the model accuracy to
great extent. In addition, a personalized Koopman model trained from the
individual's own data performs better than the non-personalized model.
Consequently, our control framework outperforms the traditional PID control in
both passive and active training modes. Hence the proposed method provides a
new control framework for soft rehabilitation robots.

*Martin Schuck,Sherif Samy,Angela P. Schoellig*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 系统评估了SO(3)旋转动作表示在强化学习中的影响，比较了不同表示方法在探索、熵正则化和训练稳定性方面的表现，发现局部切空间表示效果最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器人控制任务需要处理SO(3)旋转，但SO(3)没有全局平滑的最小参数化，现有表示方法（欧拉角、四元数等）各有约束和失败模式，其在强化学习中的影响尚不明确。

Method: 在三种标准连续控制算法（PPO、SAC、TD3）下系统评估SO(3)动作表示，比较不同表示如何影响探索、与熵正则化的交互以及训练稳定性，并分析从欧几里得网络输出获得有效旋转的不同投影方法。

Result: 表示引入的几何结构强烈影响探索和优化，将动作表示为局部坐标系中的切向量在所有算法中产生最可靠的结果。

Conclusion: 为旋转动作的选择和使用提供了简单、可直接实施的指导原则，强调局部切空间表示在强化学习中的优越性。

Abstract: Many robotic control tasks require policies to act on orientations, yet the
geometry of SO(3) makes this nontrivial. Because SO(3) admits no global,
smooth, minimal parameterization, common representations such as Euler angles,
quaternions, rotation matrices, and Lie algebra coordinates introduce distinct
constraints and failure modes. While these trade-offs are well studied for
supervised learning, their implications for actions in reinforcement learning
remain unclear. We systematically evaluate SO(3) action representations across
three standard continuous control algorithms, PPO, SAC, and TD3, under dense
and sparse rewards. We compare how representations shape exploration, interact
with entropy regularization, and affect training stability through empirical
studies and analyze the implications of different projections for obtaining
valid rotations from Euclidean network outputs. Across a suite of robotics
benchmarks, we quantify the practical impact of these choices and distill
simple, implementation-ready guidelines for selecting and using rotation
actions. Our results highlight that representation-induced geometry strongly
influences exploration and optimization and show that representing actions as
tangent vectors in the local frame yields the most reliable results across
algorithms.

Conclusion: DemoHLM框架成功实现了从单次仿真演示到真实机器人的通用化移动操作，为复杂人机交互环境中的自主操作提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Loco-manipulation is a fundamental challenge for humanoid robots to achieve
versatile interactions in human environments. Although recent studies have made
significant progress in humanoid whole-body control, loco-manipulation remains
underexplored and often relies on hard-coded task definitions or costly
real-world data collection, which limits autonomy and generalization. We
present DemoHLM, a framework for humanoid loco-manipulation that enables
generalizable loco-manipulation on a real humanoid robot from a single
demonstration in simulation. DemoHLM adopts a hierarchy that integrates a
low-level universal whole-body controller with high-level manipulation policies
for multiple tasks. The whole-body controller maps whole-body motion commands
to joint torques and provides omnidirectional mobility for the humanoid robot.
The manipulation policies, learned in simulation via our data generation and
imitation learning pipeline, command the whole-body controller with closed-loop
visual feedback to execute challenging loco-manipulation tasks. Experiments
show a positive correlation between the amount of synthetic data and policy
performance, underscoring the effectiveness of our data generation pipeline and
the data efficiency of our approach. Real-world experiments on a Unitree G1
robot equipped with an RGB-D camera validate the sim-to-real transferability of
DemoHLM, demonstrating robust performance under spatial variations across ten
loco-manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Rotor failures in quadrotors may result in high-speed rotation and vibration
due to rotor imbalance, which introduces significant challenges for autonomous
flight in unknown environments. The mainstream approaches against rotor
failures rely on fault-tolerant control (FTC) and predefined trajectory
tracking. To the best of our knowledge, online failure detection and diagnosis
(FDD), trajectory planning, and FTC of the post-failure quadrotors in unknown
and complex environments have not yet been achieved. This paper presents a
rotor-failure-aware quadrotor navigation system designed to mitigate the
impacts of rotor imbalance. First, a composite FDD-based nonlinear model
predictive controller (NMPC), incorporating motor dynamics, is designed to
ensure fast failure detection and flight stability. Second, a
rotor-failure-aware planner is designed to leverage FDD results and
spatial-temporal joint optimization, while a LiDAR-based quadrotor platform
with four anti-torque plates is designed to enable reliable perception under
high-speed rotation. Lastly, extensive benchmarks against state-of-the-art
methods highlight the superior performance of the proposed approach in
addressing rotor failures, including propeller unloading and motor stoppage.
The experimental results demonstrate, for the first time, that our approach
enables autonomous quadrotor flight with rotor failures in challenging
environments, including cluttered rooms and unknown forests.

Conclusion: 所提出的自适应轨迹采样和预测感知控制方法能够有效解决动态拥挤环境中的机器人跟随问题，提升跟随性能和人机交互体验。

Abstract: Robot person following (RPF) is a core capability in human-robot interaction,
enabling robots to assist users in daily activities, collaborative work, and
other service scenarios. However, achieving practical RPF remains challenging
due to frequent occlusions, particularly in dynamic and crowded environments.
Existing approaches often rely on fixed-point following or sparse
candidate-point selection with oversimplified heuristics, which cannot
adequately handle complex occlusions caused by moving obstacles such as
pedestrians. To address these limitations, we propose an adaptive trajectory
sampling method that generates dense candidate points within socially aware
zones and evaluates them using a multi-objective cost function. Based on the
optimal point, a person-following trajectory is estimated relative to the
predicted motion of the target. We further design a prediction-aware model
predictive path integral (MPPI) controller that simultaneously tracks this
trajectory and proactively avoids collisions using predicted pedestrian
motions. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines in smoothness, safety, robustness, and human
comfort, with its effectiveness further demonstrated on a mobile robot in
real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: 这项工作推进了对操作表示学习的理解，并为增强机器人在复杂场景中的性能提供了实用方法。

Abstract: Effective generalization in robotic manipulation requires representations
that capture invariant patterns of interaction across environments and tasks.
We present a self-supervised framework for learning hierarchical manipulation
concepts that encode these invariant patterns through cross-modal sensory
correlations and multi-level temporal abstractions without requiring human
annotation. Our approach combines a cross-modal correlation network that
identifies persistent patterns across sensory modalities with a multi-horizon
predictor that organizes representations hierarchically across temporal scales.
Manipulation concepts learned through this dual structure enable policies to
focus on transferable relational patterns while maintaining awareness of both
immediate actions and longer-term goals. Empirical evaluation across simulated
benchmarks and real-world deployments demonstrates significant performance
improvements with our concept-enhanced policies. Analysis reveals that the
learned concepts resemble human-interpretable manipulation primitives despite
receiving no semantic supervision. This work advances both the understanding of
representation learning for manipulation and provides a practical approach to
enhancing robotic performance in complex scenarios.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel framework for humanoid robots to execute
inspection tasks with high efficiency and millimeter-level precision. The
approach combines hierarchical planning, time-optimal standing position
generation, and integrated \ac{mpc} to achieve high speed and precision. A
hierarchical planning strategy, leveraging \ac{ik} and \ac{mip}, reduces
computational complexity by decoupling the high-dimensional planning problem. A
novel MIP formulation optimizes standing position selection and trajectory
length, minimizing task completion time. Furthermore, an MPC system with
simplified kinematics and single-step position correction ensures
millimeter-level end-effector tracking accuracy. Validated through simulations
and experiments on the Kuavo 4Pro humanoid platform, the framework demonstrates
low time cost and a high success rate in multi-location tasks, enabling

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SIM是一种共享内存传输方案，专为自动驾驶车辆中的主机内管道设计，可显著降低ROS 2中间件的数据传输延迟，提高控制频率和安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高速自动驾驶车辆需要快速控制循环和严格受限的感知到执行延迟。ROS 2中间件在多传感器和控制节点共享计算单元时，会引入显著的（反）序列化、复制和发现开销，缩小可用时间预算。

Method: SIM采用共享内存传输，保持传感器数据的原生内存布局，使用无锁有界双缓冲区优先数据新鲜度，并可通过四行代码集成到ROS 2节点中。

Result: 在NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano上，SIM相比ROS 2零拷贝传输将数据传输延迟降低高达98%，平均延迟降低约95%，尾部延迟降低约96%。在实际车辆测试中，将定位频率从7.5 Hz提升到9.5 Hz，感知到决策平均延迟从521.91 ms降至290.26 ms。

Conclusion: SIM通过优化数据传输机制，显著改善了自动驾驶系统的实时性能，在40 mph速度下可将紧急制动距离减少4.14米，提高了车辆安全性。

Abstract: Ensuring safety in high-speed autonomous vehicles requires rapid control
loops and tightly bounded delays from perception to actuation. Many open-source
autonomy systems rely on ROS 2 middleware; when multiple sensor and control
nodes share one compute unit, ROS 2 and its DDS transports add significant
(de)serialization, copying, and discovery overheads, shrinking the available
time budget. We present Sensor-in-Memory (SIM), a shared-memory transport
designed for intra-host pipelines in autonomous vehicles. SIM keeps sensor data
in native memory layouts (e.g., cv::Mat, PCL), uses lock-free bounded double
buffers that overwrite old data to prioritize freshness, and integrates into
ROS 2 nodes with four lines of code. Unlike traditional middleware, SIM
operates beside ROS 2 and is optimized for applications where data freshness
and minimal latency outweigh guaranteed completeness. SIM provides sequence
numbers, a writer heartbeat, and optional checksums to ensure ordering,
liveness, and basic integrity. On an NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano, SIM reduces
data-transport latency by up to 98% compared to ROS 2 zero-copy transports such
as FastRTPS and Zenoh, lowers mean latency by about 95%, and narrows
95th/99th-percentile tail latencies by around 96%. In tests on a
production-ready Level 4 vehicle running Autoware.Universe, SIM increased
localization frequency from 7.5 Hz to 9.5 Hz. Applied across all
latency-critical modules, SIM cut average perception-to-decision latency from
521.91 ms to 290.26 ms, reducing emergency braking distance at 40 mph (64 km/h)
on dry concrete by 13.6 ft (4.14 m).

this end, the decision-making process is organized into two abstraction levels:
low-level policies learn precise control maneuvers, while high-level policies
issue tactical commands based on mission objectives. Empirical results show
that our hierarchical approach improves both learning efficiency and combat
performance in complex dogfight scenarios.

Conclusion: 该方法通过平滑动作调节而非动作覆盖，有效解决了安全强化学习中探索与安全的平衡问题，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Safe reinforcement learning (RL) seeks to mitigate unsafe behaviors that
arise from exploration during training by reducing constraint violations while
maintaining task performance. Existing approaches typically rely on a single
policy to jointly optimize reward and safety, which can cause instability due
to conflicting objectives, or they use external safety filters that override
actions and require prior system knowledge. In this paper, we propose a modular
cost-aware regulator that scales the agent's actions based on predicted
constraint violations, preserving exploration through smooth action modulation
rather than overriding the policy. The regulator is trained to minimize
constraint violations while avoiding degenerate suppression of actions. Our
approach integrates seamlessly with off-policy RL methods such as SAC and TD3,
and achieves state-of-the-art return-to-cost ratios on Safety Gym locomotion
tasks with sparse costs, reducing constraint violations by up to 126 times
while increasing returns by over an order of magnitude compared to prior
methods.

Abstract: MAVs have great potential to assist humans in complex tasks, with
applications ranging from logistics to emergency response. Their agility makes
them ideal for operations in complex and dynamic environments. However,
achieving precise control in agile flights remains a significant challenge,
particularly due to the underactuated nature of quadrotors and the strong
coupling between their translational and rotational dynamics. In this work, we
propose a novel NMPC framework based on dual-quaternions (DQ-NMPC) for
quadrotor flight. By representing both quadrotor dynamics and the pose error
directly on the dual-quaternion manifold, our approach enables a compact and
globally non-singular formulation that captures the quadrotor coupled dynamics.
We validate our approach through simulations and real-world experiments,
demonstrating better numerical conditioning and significantly improved tracking
performance, with reductions in position and orientation errors of up to 56.11%
and 56.77%, compared to a conventional baseline NMPC method. Furthermore, our
controller successfully handles aggressive trajectories, reaching maximum
speeds up to 13.66 m/s and accelerations reaching 4.2 g within confined space
conditions of dimensions 11m x 4.5m x 3.65m under which the baseline controller
fails.

TL;DR: 提出了IntersectioNDE模拟器，专门针对复杂城市交叉口场景，通过交互解耦策略解决高密度异构交互模拟的挑战，在CiCross数据集上表现出优越的仿真保真度和稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据驱动模拟器难以有效建模城市交叉口密集异构交互（包括机动车、非机动车和行人），存在模式坍塌和长期模拟不稳定问题，特别是在中国等国家这类场景普遍且重要。

Method: 提出交互解耦策略(IDS)，从智能体子集学习组合动态，实现边缘到联合的模拟，并集成到场景感知Transformer网络中，配合专门训练技术。

Result: 在CiCross数据集上的实验表明，IntersectioNDE在仿真保真度、稳定性以及复现复杂分布级城市交通动态方面优于基线方法。

Conclusion: IntersectioNDE通过创新的交互解耦策略和场景感知架构，成功解决了城市交叉口密集异构交互模拟的挑战，为自动驾驶测试提供了更可靠的仿真环境。

Abstract: Realistic traffic simulation is critical for ensuring the safety and
reliability of autonomous vehicles (AVs), especially in complex and diverse
urban traffic environments. However, existing data-driven simulators face two
key challenges: a limited focus on modeling dense, heterogeneous interactions
at urban intersections - which are prevalent, crucial, and practically
significant in countries like China, featuring diverse agents including
motorized vehicles (MVs), non-motorized vehicles (NMVs), and pedestrians - and
the inherent difficulty in robustly learning high-dimensional joint
distributions for such high-density scenes, often leading to mode collapse and
long-term simulation instability. We introduce City Crossings Dataset
(CiCross), a large-scale dataset collected from a real-world urban
intersection, uniquely capturing dense, heterogeneous multi-agent interactions,
particularly with a substantial proportion of MVs, NMVs and pedestrians. Based
on this dataset, we propose IntersectioNDE (Intersection Naturalistic Driving
Environment), a data-driven simulator tailored for complex urban intersection
scenarios. Its core component is the Interaction Decoupling Strategy (IDS), a
training paradigm that learns compositional dynamics from agent subsets,
enabling the marginal-to-joint simulation. Integrated into a scene-aware
Transformer network with specialized training techniques, IDS significantly
enhances simulation robustness and long-term stability for modeling
heterogeneous interactions. Experiments on CiCross show that IntersectioNDE
outperforms baseline methods in simulation fidelity, stability, and its ability
to replicate complex, distribution-level urban traffic dynamics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在动态不确定环境中，腿式和空中机器人的状态估计面临过程噪声和测量噪声协方差难以确定的问题，通常需要手动调整。

Method: 采用双层优化框架：上层将噪声协方差和模型参数作为优化变量，下层执行全信息估计器。通过估计器的微分实现轨迹级目标的直接优化。

Result: 在四足和人形机器人上验证，相比手动调整基线，估计精度和不确定性校准显著提升。

Conclusion: 该方法将状态估计、传感器和运动学校准统一为原则性的数据驱动框架，适用于多种机器人平台。

Abstract: Accurate state estimation is critical for legged and aerial robots operating
in dynamic, uncertain environments. A key challenge lies in specifying process
and measurement noise covariances, which are typically unknown or manually
tuned. In this work, we introduce a bi-level optimization framework that
jointly calibrates covariance matrices and kinematic parameters in an
estimator-in-the-loop manner. The upper level treats noise covariances and
model parameters as optimization variables, while the lower level executes a
full-information estimator. Differentiating through the estimator allows direct
optimization of trajectory-level objectives, resulting in accurate and
consistent state estimates. We validate our approach on quadrupedal and
humanoid robots, demonstrating significantly improved estimation accuracy and
uncertainty calibration compared to hand-tuned baselines. Our method unifies
state estimation, sensor, and kinematics calibration into a principled,
data-driven framework applicable across diverse robotic platforms.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: NaviGait是一个分层框架，结合了轨迹优化的结构和强化学习的适应性，用于实现稳健直观的双足运动控制。它利用离线优化的步态库，通过高层命令生成连续参考运动，并通过策略提供关节级和速度命令残差修正来稳定参考轨迹。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习虽然能学习稳健的双足运动控制策略，但奖励函数设计复杂且不直观；而离线轨迹优化方法虽然可调性和可解释性更好，但对现实世界扰动较为脆弱。因此需要结合两者的优势。

Method: 采用分层框架：高层利用离线优化的步态库进行平滑插值生成连续参考运动；低层使用强化学习策略提供关节级和速度命令残差修正来调制和稳定参考轨迹。

Result: NaviGait相比传统和基于模仿的强化学习训练速度更快，产生的运动最接近原始参考，并且通过编码轨迹优化的丰富运动先验简化了奖励设计。

Conclusion: 通过将高层运动生成与低层修正解耦，NaviGait为实现动态和稳健的运动控制提供了更可扩展和泛化的方法。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful method to learn robust
control policies for bipedal locomotion. Yet, it can be difficult to tune
desired robot behaviors due to unintuitive and complex reward design. In
comparison, offline trajectory optimization methods, like Hybrid Zero Dynamics,
offer more tuneable, interpretable, and mathematically grounded motion plans
for high-dimensional legged systems. However, these methods often remain
brittle to real-world disturbances like external perturbations.
  In this work, we present NaviGait, a hierarchical framework that combines the
structure of trajectory optimization with the adaptability of RL for robust and
intuitive locomotion control. NaviGait leverages a library of offline-optimized
gaits and smoothly interpolates between them to produce continuous reference
motions in response to high-level commands. The policy provides both
joint-level and velocity command residual corrections to modulate and stabilize
the reference trajectories in the gait library. One notable advantage of
NaviGait is that it dramatically simplifies reward design by encoding rich
motion priors from trajectory optimization, reducing the need for finely tuned
shaping terms and enabling more stable and interpretable learning. Our
experimental results demonstrate that NaviGait enables faster training compared
to conventional and imitation-based RL, and produces motions that remain
closest to the original reference. Overall, by decoupling high-level motion
generation from low-level correction, NaviGait offers a more scalable and
generalizable approach for achieving dynamic and robust locomotion.

Conclusion: 外部跟踪系统的引入扩展了教育机器人的应用范围，使学习更高层次的机器人学概念成为可能。

Abstract: Recent developments of low cost off-the-shelf programmable components, their
modularity, and also rapid prototyping made educational robotics flourish, as
it is accessible in most schools today. They allow to illustrate and embody
theoretical problems in practical and tangible applications, and gather
multidisciplinary skills. They also give a rich natural context for
project-oriented pedagogy. However, most current robot kits all are limited to
egocentric aspect of the robots perception. This makes it difficult to access
more high-level problems involving e.g. coordinates or navigation. In this
paper we introduce an educational holonomous robot kit that comes with an
external tracking system, which lightens the constraint on embedded systems,
but allows in the same time to discover high-level aspects of robotics,
otherwise unreachable.

Abstract: Scooping items with tools such as spoons and ladles is common in daily life,
ranging from assistive feeding to retrieving items from environmental disaster
sites. However, developing a general and autonomous robotic scooping policy is
challenging since it requires reasoning about complex tool-object interactions.
Furthermore, scooping often involves manipulating deformable objects, such as
granular media or liquids, which is challenging due to their
infinite-dimensional configuration spaces and complex dynamics. We propose a
method, SCOOP'D, which uses simulation from OmniGibson (built on NVIDIA
Omniverse) to collect scooping demonstrations using algorithmic procedures that
rely on privileged state information. Then, we use generative policies via
diffusion to imitate demonstrations from observational input. We directly apply
the learned policy in diverse real-world scenarios, testing its performance on
various item quantities, item characteristics, and container types. In
zero-shot deployment, our method demonstrates promising results across 465
trials in diverse scenarios, including objects of different difficulty levels
that we categorize as "Level 1" and "Level 2." SCOOP'D outperforms all
baselines and ablations, suggesting that this is a promising approach to
acquiring robotic scooping skills. Project page is at

Abstract: Accurate real-time estimation of end effector interaction forces in hydraulic
excavators is a key enabler for advanced automation in heavy machinery.
Accurate knowledge of these forces allows improved, precise grading and digging
maneuvers. To address these challenges, we introduce a high-accuracy,
retrofittable 2D force- and payload estimation algorithm that does not impose
additional requirements on the operator regarding trajectory, acceleration or
the use of the slew joint. The approach is designed for retrofittability,
requires minimal calibration and no prior knowledge of machine-specific dynamic
characteristics. Specifically, we propose a method for identifying a dynamic
model, necessary to estimate both end effector interaction forces and bucket
payload during normal operation. Our optimization-based payload estimation
achieves a full-scale payload accuracy of 1%. On a standard 25 t excavator, the
online force measurement from pressure and inertial measurements achieves a
direction accuracy of 13 degree and a magnitude accuracy of 383 N. The method's
accuracy and generalization capability are validated on two excavator platforms
of different type and weight classes. We benchmark our payload estimation
against a classical quasistatic method and a commercially available system. Our
system outperforms both in accuracy and precision.

Conclusion: 该框架实现了从本体感知和自我中心深度图像的鲁棒实时接触规划，展示了在物理人形机器人上的成功部署。

Abstract: Enabling humanoid robots to exploit physical contact, rather than simply
avoid collisions, is crucial for autonomy in unstructured environments.
Traditional optimization-based planners struggle with contact complexity, while
on-policy reinforcement learning (RL) is sample-inefficient and has limited
multi-task ability. We propose a framework combining a learned world model with
sampling-based Model Predictive Control (MPC), trained on a demonstration-free
offline dataset to predict future outcomes in a compressed latent space. To
address sparse contact rewards and sensor noise, the MPC uses a learned
surrogate value function for dense, robust planning. Our single, scalable model
supports contact-aware tasks, including wall support after perturbation,
blocking incoming objects, and traversing height-limited arches, with improved
data efficiency and multi-task capability over on-policy RL. Deployed on a
physical humanoid, our system achieves robust, real-time contact planning from
proprioception and ego-centric depth images. Website:

Abstract: Learning robotic manipulation policies directly in the real world can be
expensive and time-consuming. While reinforcement learning (RL) policies
trained in simulation present a scalable alternative, effective sim-to-real
transfer remains challenging, particularly for tasks that require precise
dynamics. To address this, we propose Phys2Real, a real-to-sim-to-real RL
pipeline that combines vision-language model (VLM)-inferred physical parameter
estimates with interactive adaptation through uncertainty-aware fusion. Our
approach consists of three core components: (1) high-fidelity geometric
reconstruction with 3D Gaussian splatting, (2) VLM-inferred prior distributions
over physical parameters, and (3) online physical parameter estimation from
interaction data. Phys2Real conditions policies on interpretable physical
parameters, refining VLM predictions with online estimates via ensemble-based
uncertainty quantification. On planar pushing tasks of a T-block with varying
center of mass (CoM) and a hammer with an off-center mass distribution,
Phys2Real achieves substantial improvements over a domain randomization
baseline: 100% vs 79% success rate for the bottom-weighted T-block, 57% vs 23%
in the challenging top-weighted T-block, and 15% faster average task completion
for hammer pushing. Ablation studies indicate that the combination of VLM and

Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) has emerged as a successful strategy in
industrial-scale recommender systems, offering significant advantages such as
capturing diverse users' interests and accurately detecting different behaviors
like ``click" or ``dwell time". However, negative transfer and the seesaw
phenomenon pose challenges to MTL models due to the complex and often
contradictory task correlations in real-world recommendations. To address the
problem while making better use of personalized information, we propose a
personalized Direct Routing Gradient framework (DRGrad), which consists of
three key components: router, updater and personalized gate network. DRGrad
judges the stakes between tasks in the training process, which can leverage all
valid gradients for the respective task to reduce conflicts. We evaluate the
efficiency of DRGrad on complex MTL using a real-world recommendation dataset
with 15 billion samples. The results show that DRGrad's superior performance
over competing state-of-the-art MTL models, especially in terms of AUC (Area
Under the Curve) metrics, indicating that it effectively manages task conflicts
in multi-task learning environments without increasing model complexity, while
also addressing the deficiencies in noise processing. Moreover, experiments on
the public Census-income dataset and Synthetic dataset, have demonstrated the
capability of DRGrad in judging and routing the stakes between tasks with

Abstract: Rapid urbanization has intensified traffic congestion, environmental strain,

that integrates CCTV surveillance videos with multi-source data descriptors to
enhance real-time urban traffic prediction. The proposed methodology
incorporates spatio-temporal feature fusion, Frequent Episode Mining for
sequential traffic pattern discovery, and a hybrid LSTM-Transformer model for
robust traffic state forecasting. The framework was evaluated on the CityFlowV2
dataset comprising 313,931 annotated bounding boxes across 46 cameras. It
achieved a high prediction accuracy of 98.46 percent, with a macro precision of
0.9800, macro recall of 0.9839, and macro F1-score of 0.9819. FEM analysis
revealed significant sequential patterns such as moderate-congested transitions
with confidence levels exceeding 55 percent. The 46 sustained congestion alerts
are system-generated, which shows practical value for proactive congestion
management. This emphasizes the need for the incorporation of video stream
analytics with data from multiple sources for the design of real-time,

Abstract: Accurate simulation of wave propagation in complex acoustic materials is
crucial for applications in sound design, noise control, and material
engineering. Traditional numerical solvers, such as finite element methods, are
computationally expensive, especially when dealing with large-scale or
real-time scenarios. In this work, we introduce a dataset of 31,000 acoustic
materials, named HA30K, designed and simulated solving the Helmholtz equations.
For each material, we provide the geometric configuration and the corresponding
pressure field solution, enabling data-driven approaches to learn Helmholtz
equation solutions. As a baseline, we explore a deep learning approach based on
Stable Diffusion with ControlNet, a state-of-the-art model for image
generation. Unlike classical solvers, our approach leverages GPU
parallelization to process multiple simulations simultaneously, drastically
reducing computation time. By representing solutions as images, we bypass the
need for complex simulation software and explicit equation-solving.
Additionally, the number of diffusion steps can be adjusted at inference time,
balancing speed and quality. We aim to demonstrate that deep learning-based
methods are particularly useful in early-stage research, where rapid
exploration is more critical than absolute accuracy.

Conclusion: GradFix提供了一种无需额外微调的有效方法，通过局部对齐目标损失景观来重新基准化任务向量，确保一阶下降的理论保证。

Abstract: When a new release of a foundation model is published, practitioners
typically need to repeat full fine-tuning, even if the same task has already
been solved in the previous version. A promising alternative is to reuse the
parameter changes (i.e., task vectors) that capture how a model adapts to a
specific task. However, they often fail to transfer across different
pre-trained models due to their misaligned parameter space. In this work, we
show that the key to successful transfer lies in the sign structure of the
gradients of the new model. Based on this insight, we propose GradFix, a novel
method that approximates the ideal gradient sign structure and leverages it to
transfer knowledge using only a handful of labeled samples. Notably, this
requires no additional fine-tuning: the adaptation is achieved by computing a
few gradients at the target model and masking the source task vector
accordingly. This yields an update that is locally aligned with the target loss
landscape, effectively rebasing the task vector onto the new pre-training. We
provide a theoretical guarantee that our method ensures first-order descent.
Empirically, we demonstrate significant performance gains on vision and
language benchmarks, consistently outperforming naive task vector addition and
few-shot fine-tuning.

*Edgar E. Robles,Dikshant Sagar,Alejandro Yankelevich,Jianming Bian,Pierre Baldi,NOvA Collaboration*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个点集神经网络模型，用于处理NOvA中微子实验的稀疏2D探测器数据，通过混合两个视图的信息，在减少90%内存使用的同时，将AUC分数从85.4%提升到96.8%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NOvA中微子实验需要将探测器中的原始命中点匹配到源粒子并识别粒子类型，传统方法使用聚类和卷积神经网络，但由于探测器结构，数据以两个稀疏2D图像（XZ和YZ视图）呈现，而非3D表示。

Method: 提出点集神经网络，直接在稀疏矩阵上操作，通过混合两个视图信息的操作来处理数据。

Result: 模型使用不到之前方法10%的内存，实现了96.8%的AUC分数，高于两个视图独立处理时的85.4%。

Conclusion: 点集神经网络能有效处理NOvA实验的稀疏2D数据，在显著减少内存使用的同时提高了粒子识别性能。

Abstract: NOvA is a long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiment that detects neutrino
particles from the NuMI beam at Fermilab. Before data from this experiment can
be used in analyses, raw hits in the detector must be matched to their source
particles, and the type of each particle must be identified. This task has
commonly been done using a mix of traditional clustering approaches and
convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Due to the construction of the detector,
the data is presented as two sparse 2D images: an XZ and a YZ view of the
detector, rather than a 3D representation. We propose a point set neural
network that operates on the sparse matrices with an operation that mixes
information from both views. Our model uses less than 10% of the memory
required using previous methods while achieving a 96.8% AUC score, a higher
score than obtained when both views are processed independently (85.4%).

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了谱各向异性高斯扩散(SAGD)，通过引入各向异性噪声算子来构建扩散模型的归纳偏置，用结构化的频率对角协方差替代各向同性协方差，从而更好地适应数据分布。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散概率模型(DPMs)虽然取得了强大的生成性能，但其归纳偏置仍然很大程度上是隐式的。作者希望将归纳偏置明确地构建到扩散模型的训练和采样过程中，以更好地适应目标数据分布。

Method: 引入各向异性噪声算子，用结构化的频率对角协方差替代各向同性前向协方差，统一了带通掩码和幂律加权方法，允许强调或抑制特定频带，同时保持前向过程的高斯性。推导了各向异性协方差的得分关系。

Result: 实验表明，诱导的各向异性在多个视觉数据集上优于标准扩散模型，并实现了选择性忽略：在学习过程中忽略已知局限于特定频带的损坏。

Conclusion: 精心设计的各向异性前向噪声为在DPMs中定制归纳偏置提供了一个简单而有原则的方法。

Abstract: Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) have achieved strong generative
performance, yet their inductive biases remain largely implicit. In this work,
we aim to build inductive biases into the training and sampling of diffusion
models to better accommodate the target distribution of the data to model. We
introduce an anisotropic noise operator that shapes these biases by replacing
the isotropic forward covariance with a structured, frequency-diagonal
covariance. This operator unifies band-pass masks and power-law weightings,
allowing us to emphasize or suppress designated frequency bands, while keeping
the forward process Gaussian. We refer to this as spectrally anisotropic
Gaussian diffusion (SAGD). In this work, we derive the score relation for
anisotropic covariances and show that, under full support, the learned score
converges to the true data score as $t\!\to\!0$, while anisotropy reshapes the
probability-flow path from noise to data. Empirically, we show the induced
anisotropy outperforms standard diffusion across several vision datasets, and
enables selective omission: learning while ignoring known corruptions confined
to specific bands. Together, these results demonstrate that carefully designed
anisotropic forward noise provides a simple, yet principled, handle to tailor
inductive bias in DPMs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了两种基于Bode图表示的新损失函数log-B和log-BW，用于电化学阻抗谱数据的等效电路模型拟合。通过大规模数据集评估，发现X2损失函数在拟合质量方面表现最佳，而log-B在计算效率和参数误差方面具有优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的电化学阻抗谱数据建模使用等效电路模型，通过非线性最小二乘拟合获得参数。现有损失函数在收敛性、计算效率和拟合质量方面存在权衡，需要开发更优的损失函数来改善这些性能指标。

Method: 基于EIS的Bode图表示推导出两种新损失函数log-B和log-BW。使用生成的大规模EIS数据集，评估新损失函数与现有损失函数在R2分数、卡方值、计算效率和平均绝对百分比误差等方面的性能。

Result: 统计比较显示，损失函数的选择影响收敛性、计算效率、拟合质量和MAPE。X2损失函数在多个拟合质量指标上表现最佳，而log-B虽然拟合质量略低，但计算速度快约1.4倍，且对大多数电路组件产生更低的MAPE。

Conclusion: 当拟合质量是主要目标时，X2损失函数是首选；对于大规模最小二乘拟合应用（如机器学习模型训练），log-B是一个强有力的替代方案，在计算效率和参数精度方面具有优势。

Abstract: Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data is typically modeled using
an equivalent circuit model (ECM), with parameters obtained by minimizing a
loss function via nonlinear least squares fitting. This paper introduces two
new loss functions, log-B and log-BW, derived from the Bode representation of
EIS. Using a large dataset of generated EIS data, the performance of proposed
loss functions was evaluated alongside existing ones in terms of R2 scores,
chi-squared, computational efficiency, and the mean absolute percentage error
(MAPE) between the predicted component values and the original values.
Statistical comparisons revealed that the choice of loss function impacts
convergence, computational efficiency, quality of fit, and MAPE. Our analysis
showed that X2 loss function (squared sum of residuals with proportional
weighting) achieved the highest performance across multiple quality of fit
metrics, making it the preferred choice when the quality of fit is the primary
goal. On the other hand, log-B offered a slightly lower quality of fit while
being approximately 1.4 times faster and producing lower MAPE for most circuit
components, making log-B as a strong alternative. This is a critical factor for
large-scale least squares fitting in data-driven applications, such as training
machine learning models on extensive datasets or iterations.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度跨模态哈希方法的多标签语义提取过程未能与原始多模态数据显式交互，导致学习到的表示级语义信息与异构多模态数据不兼容，阻碍了模态差距的弥合。

Method: 将多标签信息作为新的文本模态，构建真实标签提示集；设计跨模态教师网络在图像和标签模态间蒸馏语义特征，学习图像模态的Hamming空间；将该空间作为先验知识指导学生网络学习。

Result: 在两个基准数据集上的广泛实验证明了该模型优于最先进方法。

Conclusion: SODA方法通过语义凝聚知识蒸馏有效提升了跨模态哈希性能，能够全面保持图像和文本模态间的语义相似性。

Abstract: Recently, deep supervised cross-modal hashing methods have achieve compelling
success by learning semantic information in a self-supervised way. However,
they still suffer from the key limitation that the multi-label semantic
extraction process fail to explicitly interact with raw multimodal data, making
the learned representation-level semantic information not compatible with the
heterogeneous multimodal data and hindering the performance of bridging
modality gap. To address this limitation, in this paper, we propose a novel
semantic cohesive knowledge distillation scheme for deep cross-modal hashing,
dubbed as SODA. Specifically, the multi-label information is introduced as a
new textual modality and reformulated as a set of ground-truth label prompt,
depicting the semantics presented in the image like the text modality. Then, a
cross-modal teacher network is devised to effectively distill cross-modal
semantic characteristics between image and label modalities and thus learn a
well-mapped Hamming space for image modality. In a sense, such Hamming space
can be regarded as a kind of prior knowledge to guide the learning of
cross-modal student network and comprehensively preserve the semantic
similarities between image and text modality. Extensive experiments on two
benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our model over the
state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: LMCache是首个高效的开源KV缓存解决方案，通过跨引擎和查询共享KV缓存来提升LLM推理系统的资源效率，支持缓存卸载和预填充-解码分离，结合vLLM可实现高达15倍的吞吐量提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM推理系统将引擎和查询独立处理导致资源效率低下，虽然已有避免冗余计算和提升GPU利用率的提议，但缺乏高效的KV缓存卸载和通信机制。

Method: LMCache提取并存储现代LLM引擎生成的KV缓存，通过优化数据移动（批量操作、计算和I/O流水线）、模块化连接器组件和灵活的控制API实现跨层缓存编排。

Result: 评估显示LMCache与vLLM结合在各种工作负载下可实现高达15倍的吞吐量提升，并已在企业推理系统中获得广泛应用。

Conclusion: LMCache通过高效的KV缓存共享机制显著提升了LLM推理系统的资源效率，其模块化设计和社区采用为未来KV缓存解决方案提供了宝贵经验。

Abstract: Today's LLM inference systems treat individual engines and queries
independently for simplicity, but this causes significant resource
inefficiencies. While there are proposals to avoid redundant computation by
reusing KV caches across queries and to increase GPU utilization by
disaggregating a single query to different engines, their promises cannot be
realized without efficiently offloading and communicating KV cache across LLM
inference engines and queries.
  We present LMCache, the first and so far the most efficient open-source KV
caching solution, which extracts and stores KV caches generated by modern LLM
engines (vLLM and SGLang) and shares the KV caches across engines and queries.
LMCache exposes KV caches in the LLM engine interface, effectively transforming
LLM engines from individual token processors to a collection of engines with KV
cache as the storage and communication medium. In particular, it supports both
cache offloading (prefix reuse across queries) and prefill-decode
disaggregation (cross-engine cache transfer). LMCache's high performance and
wide adoption stem from the following contributions: highly optimized KV cache
data movement with performance optimizations including batched data movement
operations, compute and I/O pipelining; a modular KV cache connector component,
decoupling LMCache from the rapid evolution of inference engines; a first-class
control API, such as pinning, lookup, cleanup, movement, and compression, for
flexible cache orchestration across GPU, CPU, storage, and network layers.
Evaluation shows that combining LMCache with vLLM achieves up to 15x
improvement in throughput across diverse workloads. With a growing community,
LMCache has seen dramatic growth in adoption by enterprise inference systems,
which provides valuable lessons for future KV caching solutions. The source
code of LMCache is at: https://github.com/LMCache/LMCache.

Abstract: Climate change is intensifying wildfire risks globally, making reliable
forecasting critical for adaptation strategies. While machine learning shows
promise for wildfire prediction from Earth observation data, current approaches
lack uncertainty quantification essential for risk-aware decision making. We
present the first systematic analysis of spatial uncertainty in wildfire spread
forecasting using multimodal Earth observation inputs. We demonstrate that
predictive uncertainty exhibits coherent spatial structure concentrated near
fire perimeters. Our novel distance metric reveals high-uncertainty regions
form consistent 20-60 meter buffer zones around predicted firelines - directly
applicable for emergency planning. Feature attribution identifies vegetation
health and fire activity as primary uncertainty drivers. This work enables more
robust wildfire management systems supporting communities adapting to
increasing fire risk under climate change.

Conclusion: 该框架为构建可靠、可解释且计算高效的模型提供了实用途径，可支持更安全的药物治疗和临床决策。

Abstract: Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) are a leading cause of preventable adverse
events, often complicating treatment and increasing healthcare costs. At the
same time, knowing which drugs do not interact is equally important, as such
knowledge supports safer prescriptions and better patient outcomes. In this
study, we propose an interpretable and efficient framework that blends modern
machine learning with domain knowledge to improve DDI prediction. Our approach
combines two complementary molecular embeddings - Mol2Vec, which captures
fragment-level structural patterns, and SMILES-BERT, which learns contextual
chemical features - together with a leakage-free, rule-based clinical score
(RBScore) that injects pharmacological knowledge without relying on interaction
labels. A lightweight neural classifier is then optimized using a novel
three-stage metaheuristic strategy (RSmpl-ACO-PSO), which balances global
exploration and local refinement for stable performance. Experiments on
real-world datasets demonstrate that the model achieves high predictive
accuracy (ROC-AUC 0.911, PR-AUC 0.867 on DrugBank) and generalizes well to a
clinically relevant Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus cohort. Beyond raw performance,
studies show how embedding fusion, RBScore, and the optimizer each contribute
to precision and robustness. Together, these results highlight a practical
pathway for building reliable, interpretable, and computationally efficient
models that can support safer drug therapies and clinical decision-making.

Conclusion: 该方法能够生成精细空间分辨率的合成地理人口数据，为洪水响应、流行病传播、疏散规划和交通建模等应用打开了大门。

Abstract: It is increasingly important to generate synthetic populations with explicit
coordinates rather than coarse geographic areas, yet no established methods
exist to achieve this. One reason is that latitude and longitude differ from
other continuous variables, exhibiting large empty spaces and highly uneven
densities. To address this, we propose a population synthesis algorithm that
first maps spatial coordinates into a more regular latent space using
Normalizing Flows (NF), and then combines them with other features in a
Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to generate synthetic populations. This approach
also learns the joint distribution between spatial and non-spatial features,
exploiting spatial autocorrelations. We demonstrate the method by generating
synthetic homes with the same statistical properties of real homes in 121
datasets, corresponding to diverse geographies. We further propose an
evaluation framework that measures both spatial accuracy and practical utility,
while ensuring privacy preservation. Our results show that the NF+VAE
architecture outperforms popular benchmarks, including copula-based methods and
uniform allocation within geographic areas. The ability to generate geolocated
synthetic populations at fine spatial resolution opens the door to applications
requiring detailed geography, from household responses to floods, to epidemic
spread, evacuation planning, and transport modeling.

Abstract: Modeling shock-to-detonation phenomena in energetic materials (EMs) requires
capturing complex physical processes such as strong shocks, rapid changes in
microstructural morphology, and nonlinear dynamics of chemical reaction fronts.
These processes participate in energy localization at hotspots, which initiate
chemical energy release leading to detonation. This study addresses the
formation of hotspots in crystalline EMs subjected to weak-to-moderate shock
loading, which, despite its critical relevance to the safe storage and handling
of EMs, remains underexplored compared to the well-studied strong shock
conditions. To overcome the computational challenges associated with direct
numerical simulations, we advance the Physics-Aware Recurrent Convolutional
Neural Network (PARCv2), which has been shown to be capable of predicting
strong shock responses in EMs. We improved the architecture of PARCv2 to
rapidly predict shear localizations and plastic heating, which play important
roles in the weak-to-moderate shock regime. PARCv2 is benchmarked against two
widely used physics-informed models, namely, Fourier neural operator and neural
ordinary differential equation; we demonstrate its superior performance in
capturing the spatiotemporal dynamics of shear band formation. While all models
exhibit certain failure modes, our findings underscore the importance of
domain-specific considerations in developing robust AI-accelerated simulation
tools for reactive materials.

Conclusion: C-DPS通过耦合数据与测量空间的扩散过程，提供了一种无需调优约束或近似似然的稳定逆问题解决方案，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Inverse problems, where the goal is to recover an unknown signal from noisy
or incomplete measurements, are central to applications in medical imaging,
remote sensing, and computational biology. Diffusion models have recently
emerged as powerful priors for solving such problems. However, existing methods
either rely on projection-based techniques that enforce measurement consistency
through heuristic updates, or they approximate the likelihood $p(\boldsymbol{y}
\mid \boldsymbol{x})$, often resulting in artifacts and instability under
complex or high-noise conditions. To address these limitations, we propose a
novel framework called \emph{coupled data and measurement space diffusion
posterior sampling} (C-DPS), which eliminates the need for constraint tuning or
likelihood approximation. C-DPS introduces a forward stochastic process in the
measurement space $\{\boldsymbol{y}_t\}$, evolving in parallel with the
data-space diffusion $\{\boldsymbol{x}_t\}$, which enables the derivation of a
closed-form posterior $p(\boldsymbol{x}_{t-1} \mid \boldsymbol{x}_t,
\boldsymbol{y}_{t-1})$. This coupling allows for accurate and recursive
sampling based on a well-defined posterior distribution. Empirical results
demonstrate that C-DPS consistently outperforms existing baselines, both
qualitatively and quantitatively, across multiple inverse problem benchmarks.

Conclusion: LLM驱动的AI工具可以有效地改进因果估计，生成模型的历史知识和推理能力有助于解决因果推断中的维度诅咒问题。

Abstract: We propose a simple yet effective use of LLM-powered AI tools to improve
causal estimation. In double machine learning, the accuracy of causal estimates
of the effect of a treatment on an outcome in the presence of a
high-dimensional confounder depends on the performance of estimators of
conditional expectation functions. We show that predictions made by generative
models trained on historical data can be used to improve the performance of
these estimators relative to approaches that solely rely on adjusting for
embeddings extracted from these models. We argue that the historical knowledge
and reasoning capacities associated with these generative models can help
overcome curse-of-dimensionality problems in causal inference problems. We
consider a case study using a small dataset of online jewelry auctions, and
demonstrate that inclusion of LLM-generated guesses as predictors can improve
efficiency in estimation.

Abstract: Deep learning has become a pivotal technology in fields such as computer
vision, scientific computing, and dynamical systems, significantly advancing
these disciplines. However, neural Networks persistently face challenges
related to theoretical understanding, interpretability, and generalization. To
address these issues, researchers are increasingly adopting a differential

extensive review of deep neural network architectures and dynamic modeling
methods inspired by differential equations. We specifically examine deep neural
network models and deterministic dynamical network constructs based on ordinary
differential equations (ODEs), as well as regularization techniques and
stochastic dynamical network models informed by stochastic differential
equations (SDEs). We present numerical comparisons of these models to
illustrate their characteristics and performance. Finally, we explore promising
research directions in integrating differential equations with deep learning to
offer new insights for developing intelligent computational methods that boast
enhanced interpretability and generalization capabilities.

Abstract: This study delves into the plasticity of neural networks, offering empirical
support for the notion that critical learning periods and warm-starting
performance loss can be avoided through simple adjustments to learning
hyperparameters. The critical learning phenomenon emerges when training is
initiated with deficit data. Subsequently, after numerous deficit epochs, the
network's plasticity wanes, impeding its capacity to achieve parity in accuracy
with models trained from scratch, even when extensive clean data training
follows deficit epochs. Building upon seminal research introducing critical
learning periods, we replicate key findings and broaden the experimental scope
of the main experiment from the original work. In addition, we consider a
warm-starting approach and show that it can be seen as a form of deficit
pretraining. In particular, we demonstrate that these problems can be averted
by employing a cyclic learning rate schedule. Our findings not only impact
neural network training practices but also establish a vital link between
critical learning periods and ongoing research on warm-starting neural network
training.

Abstract: Federated learning is distributed model training across several clients
without disclosing raw data. Despite advancements in data privacy, risks still
remain. Differential Privacy (DP) is a technique to protect sensitive data by
adding noise to model updates, usually controlled by a fixed privacy budget.
However, this approach can introduce excessive noise, particularly when the
model converges, which compromises performance. To address this problem,
adaptive privacy budgets have been investigated as a potential solution. This
work implements DP methods using Laplace and Gaussian mechanisms with an
adaptive privacy budget, extending the SelecEval simulator. We introduce an
adaptive clipping approach in the Gaussian mechanism, ensuring that gradients
of the model are dynamically updated rather than using a fixed sensitivity. We
conduct extensive experiments with various privacy budgets, IID and non-IID
datasets, and different numbers of selected clients per round. While our
experiments were limited to 200 training rounds, the results suggest that
adaptive privacy budgets and adaptive clipping can help maintain model accuracy
while preserving privacy.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文比较了三种无网格神经PDE求解器(PINNs、DRM、WANs)在泊松问题和薛定谔方程上的性能，提供了实用的方法选择指南和未来扩展方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 偏微分方程在科学和工程中广泛应用，但解析解罕见且传统网格求解器在高维情况下成本高昂，需要开发高效的无网格神经求解器。

Method: 在统一协议下比较PINNs、DRM和WANs三种方法，使用强制边界条件、强制节点和正交正则化，在泊松问题(最高5D)和薛定谔方程(1D/2D)上进行测试，并扩展到激光驱动情况。

Result: 所有方法在适当配置下都能达到低L2误差(10^-6-10^-9)。PINNs在精度和激发谱恢复方面最可靠；DRM在稳态问题上提供最佳精度-运行时间权衡；WAN在有效使用弱形式约束时具有竞争力。

Conclusion: 物理引导的神经求解器是解决复杂PDE的可信、可扩展工具，论文提供了方法选择指南并提出了时间依赖公式、自适应采样等未来扩展方向。

Abstract: Partial differential equations (PDEs) underpin models across science and
engineering, yet analytical solutions are atypical and classical mesh-based
solvers can be costly in high dimensions. This dissertation presents a unified
comparison of three mesh-free neural PDE solvers, physics-informed neural
networks (PINNs), the deep Ritz method (DRM), and weak adversarial networks
(WANs), on Poisson problems (up to 5D) and the time-independent Schr\"odinger
equation in 1D/2D (infinite well and harmonic oscillator), and extends the
study to a laser-driven case of Schr\"odinger's equation via the
Kramers-Henneberger (KH) transformation.
  Under a common protocol, all methods achieve low $L_2$ errors
($10^{-6}$-$10^{-9}$) when paired with forced boundary conditions (FBCs),
forced nodes (FNs), and orthogonality regularization (OG). Across tasks, PINNs
are the most reliable for accuracy and recovery of excited spectra; DRM offers
the best accuracy-runtime trade-off on stationary problems; WAN is more
sensitive but competitive when weak-form constraints and FN/OG are used
effectively. Sensitivity analyses show that FBC removes boundary-loss tuning,
network width matters more than depth for single-network solvers, and most
gains occur within 5000-10,000 epochs. The same toolkit solves the KH case,
indicating transfer beyond canonical benchmarks.
  We provide practical guidelines for method selection and outline the
following extensions: time-dependent formulations for DRM and WAN, adaptive
residual-driven sampling, parallel multi-state training, and neural domain
decomposition. These results support physics-guided neural solvers as credible,
scalable tools for solving complex PDEs.

*Xiaodan Li,Mengjie Wu,Yao Zhu,Yunna Lv,YueFeng Chen,Cen Chen,Jianmei Guo,Hui Xue*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Kelp是一个创新的流式风险检测框架，通过建模LM生成过程中的中间隐藏状态动态，实现实时风险检测，相比后处理防护方法具有更高准确性和更低延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防护方法多为后处理检测，可能在检测到不安全内容前就已暴露风险，且延迟限制迫使其使用轻量模型，限制了检测准确性。

Method: 提出Kelp框架，利用Streaming Latent Dynamics Head (SLD)建模风险在生成序列中的时间演化，并引入Anchored Temporal Consistency (ATC)损失来确保单调危害预测。

Result: 在多样化模型和数据集上，Kelp持续优于最先进的后处理防护方法和先前的插件探针（平均F1提高15.61%），仅使用20M参数且每token延迟增加小于0.5ms。

Conclusion: Kelp提供了一种高效准确的流式风险检测方法，通过实时监控LM生成过程，显著提升了内容安全防护能力。

Abstract: Large models (LMs) are powerful content generators, yet their open-ended
nature can also introduce potential risks, such as generating harmful or biased
content. Existing guardrails mostly perform post-hoc detection that may expose
unsafe content before it is caught, and the latency constraints further push
them toward lightweight models, limiting detection accuracy. In this work, we
propose Kelp, a novel plug-in framework that enables streaming risk detection
within the LM generation pipeline. Kelp leverages intermediate LM hidden states
through a Streaming Latent Dynamics Head (SLD), which models the temporal
evolution of risk across the generated sequence for more accurate real-time
risk detection. To ensure reliable streaming moderation in real applications,
we introduce an Anchored Temporal Consistency (ATC) loss to enforce monotonic
harm predictions by embedding a benign-then-harmful temporal prior. Besides,
for a rigorous evaluation of streaming guardrails, we also present
StreamGuardBench-a model-grounded benchmark featuring on-the-fly responses from
each protected model, reflecting real-world streaming scenarios in both text
and vision-language tasks. Across diverse models and datasets, Kelp
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art post-hoc guardrails and prior plug-in
probes (15.61% higher average F1), while using only 20M parameters and adding
less than 0.5 ms of per-token latency.

TL;DR: VCON是一种通过平滑过渡方式将神经网络从原始模型逐步迁移到压缩模型的方法，有效缓解压缩带来的精度下降问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络规模不断扩大，需要压缩技术来减少内存、计算和能耗，但直接应用压缩方法会导致严重的精度下降

Method: VCON在微调期间并行执行原始网络和压缩网络，逐步减少原始模型的贡献，同时逐渐增加压缩模型的贡献

Result: 在计算机视觉和自然语言处理基准测试中，VCON结合多种压缩策略都带来一致改进，典型增益超过3%，某些配置精度提升达20%

Conclusion: VCON提供了一个可泛化的方法，可应用于现有压缩技术，在多个基准测试中均显示出一致的性能提升

Abstract: The increasing scale of deep neural networks has led to a growing need for
compression techniques such as pruning, quantization, and low-rank
decomposition. While these methods are very effective in reducing memory,
computation and energy consumption, they often introduce severe accuracy
degradation when applied directly. We introduce Vanishing Contributions (VCON),
a general approach for smoothly transitioning neural models into compressed
form. Rather than replacing the original network directly with its compressed
version, VCON executes the two in parallel during fine-tuning. The contribution
of the original (uncompressed) model is progressively reduced, while that of
the compressed model is gradually increased. This smooth transition allows the
network to adapt over time, improving stability and mitigating accuracy
degradation. We evaluate VCON across computer vision and natural language
processing benchmarks, in combination with multiple compression strategies.
Across all scenarios, VCON leads to consistent improvements: typical gains
exceed 3%, while some configuration exhibits accuracy boosts of 20%. VCON thus
provides a generalizable method that can be applied to the existing compression
techniques, with evidence of consistent gains across multiple benchmarks.

Motivation: 可再生能源渗透电网的时域仿真因需要微秒级时间步长而计算困难，这阻碍了可再生能源的稳定集成和气候变化缓解。

Method: 使用三种算子学习方法作为仿真替代模型，研究时间步长不变性概念，在简单测试系统上进行零样本超分辨率和稳定/不稳定动态机制间的泛化评估。

Conclusion: 算子学习方法能够有效建模物理系统，解决了可再生能源集成中的关键挑战，为气候变化缓解提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Time domain simulation, i.e., modeling the system's evolution over time, is a
crucial tool for studying and enhancing power system stability and dynamic
performance. However, these simulations become computationally intractable for
renewable-penetrated grids, due to the small simulation time step required to
capture renewable energy resources' ultra-fast dynamic phenomena in the range
of 1-50 microseconds. This creates a critical need for solutions that are both
fast and scalable, posing a major barrier for the stable integration of
renewable energy resources and thus climate change mitigation. This paper
explores operator learning, a family of machine learning methods that learn
mappings between functions, as a surrogate model for these costly simulations.
The paper investigates, for the first time, the fundamental concept of
simulation time step-invariance, which enables models trained on coarse time
steps to generalize to fine-resolution dynamics. Three operator learning
methods are benchmarked on a simple test system that, while not incorporating
practical complexities of renewable-penetrated grids, serves as a first
proof-of-concept to demonstrate the viability of time step-invariance. Models
are evaluated on (i) zero-shot super-resolution, where training is performed on
a coarse simulation time step and inference is performed at super-resolution,
and (ii) generalization between stable and unstable dynamic regimes. This work
addresses a key challenge in the integration of renewable energy for the
mitigation of climate change by benchmarking operator learning methods to model
physical systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 静态特征排除策略往往无法防止偏见，因为隐藏的依赖关系会影响模型预测。需要动态方法来平衡泛化能力、准确性和公平性。

Method: 使用强化学习框架，构建多组件奖励函数，定义特征子集的动作空间，并与集成学习相结合，实现自适应特征选择。

Result: 该方法能够动态平衡预测性能和公平性考虑，避免传统启发式方法的局限性。

Conclusion: 该强化学习框架提供了一种灵活通用的特征选择方法，特别适用于预测因子相关且偏见可能重新出现的环境。

Abstract: Static feature exclusion strategies often fail to prevent bias when hidden
dependencies influence the model predictions. To address this issue, we explore
a reinforcement learning (RL) framework that integrates bias mitigation and
automated feature selection within a single learning process. Unlike
traditional heuristic-driven filter or wrapper approaches, our RL agent
adaptively selects features using a reward signal that explicitly integrates
predictive performance with fairness considerations. This dynamic formulation
allows the model to balance generalization, accuracy, and equity throughout the
training process, rather than rely exclusively on pre-processing adjustments or
post hoc correction mechanisms. In this paper, we describe the construction of
a multi-component reward function, the specification of the agents action space
over feature subsets, and the integration of this system with ensemble
learning. We aim to provide a flexible and generalizable way to select features
in environments where predictors are correlated and biases can inadvertently
re-emerge.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有假新闻检测模型在标准设置下表现良好，但对真实用户或大语言模型生成的对抗性评论攻击仍然脆弱，这些攻击会微妙地改变模型决策。

Method: 方法包括三个步骤：(1) 将对抗性评论分为感知、认知和社会三个心理学基础类别；(2) 通过LLMs生成多样化的类别特定攻击来增强对抗训练；(3) 应用基于Dirichlet的自适应采样机制，在训练过程中动态调整不同评论类别的学习重点。

Result: 在基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法在保持强大检测准确性的同时，显著提高了对各种对抗性评论扰动的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 提出的群体自适应对抗训练策略有效提升了假新闻检测模型对对抗性评论攻击的防御能力，为构建更鲁棒的假新闻检测系统提供了新思路。

Abstract: The spread of fake news online distorts public judgment and erodes trust in
social media platforms. Although recent fake news detection (FND) models
perform well in standard settings, they remain vulnerable to adversarial
comments-authored by real users or by large language models (LLMs)-that subtly
shift model decisions. In view of this, we first present a comprehensive
evaluation of comment attacks to existing fake news detectors and then
introduce a group-adaptive adversarial training strategy to improve the
robustness of FND models. To be specific, our approach comprises three steps:
(1) dividing adversarial comments into three psychologically grounded
categories: perceptual, cognitive, and societal; (2) generating diverse,
category-specific attacks via LLMs to enhance adversarial training; and (3)
applying a Dirichlet-based adaptive sampling mechanism (InfoDirichlet Adjusting
Mechanism) that dynamically adjusts the learning focus across different comment
categories during training. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that our
method maintains strong detection accuracy while substantially increasing
robustness to a wide range of adversarial comment perturbations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有训练数据识别方法缺乏统计保证，要么是简单的二分类任务，要么依赖于容易被违反的强假设，无法提供可靠的结果。

Method: 使用已知未见数据计算每个数据点的p值，构建测试集数据使用比例的保守估计器来缩放p值，然后通过数据依赖的阈值选择最终的训练数据集。

Result: 在多种模型（大语言模型和视觉语言模型）和数据集上的广泛实验表明，PTDI能够严格控制错误发现率，并实现更高的检测能力。

Conclusion: PTDI方法为训练数据识别提供了严格的统计保证，在版权诉讼、隐私审计和公平评估等应用中具有重要价值。

Abstract: Identifying training data within large-scale models is critical for copyright
litigation, privacy auditing, and ensuring fair evaluation. The conventional
approaches treat it as a simple binary classification task without statistical
guarantees. A recent approach is designed to control the false discovery rate
(FDR), but its guarantees rely on strong, easily violated assumptions. In this
paper, we introduce Provable Training Data Identification (PTDI), a rigorous
method that identifies a set of training data with strict false discovery rate
(FDR) control. Specifically, our method computes p-values for each data point
using a set of known unseen data, and then constructs a conservative estimator
for the data usage proportion of the test set, which allows us to scale these
p-values. Our approach then selects the final set of training data by
identifying all points whose scaled p-values fall below a data-dependent
threshold. This entire procedure enables the discovery of training data with
provable, strict FDR control and significantly boosted power. Extensive
experiments across a wide range of models (LLMs and VLMs), and datasets
demonstrate that PTDI strictly controls the FDR and achieves higher power.

Motivation: 解决联邦聚类问题，让互联设备能够基于k-means原理联合聚类整体数据集，同时保护本地数据的隐私性。

Method: 将联邦k-means聚类表述为GTVMin实例，每个设备通过解决修改后的本地k-means问题来更新本地聚类质心，修改包括添加惩罚项来衡量相邻设备聚类质心的差异。

Result: 开发出隐私友好的联邦k-means算法，仅需要在互联设备间共享聚合信息。

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了在保护隐私的前提下进行联邦聚类，为分布式环境下的数据聚类提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We consider the problem of federated clustering, where interconnected devices
have access to private local datasets and need to jointly cluster the overall
dataset without sharing their local dataset. Our focus is on hard clustering
based on the k-means principle. We formulate federated k-means clustering as an
instance of GTVMin. This formulation naturally lends to a federated k-means
algorithm where each device updates local cluster centroids by solving a
modified local k-means problem. The modification involves adding a penalty term
to measure the discrepancy between the cluster centroid of neighbouring
devices. Our federated k-means algorithm is privacy-friendly as it only
requires sharing aggregated information among interconnected devices.

Motivation: 大型语言模型具有互补优势，但现有路由方法依赖准确的模型表示，且添加新模型通常需要重新训练，限制了可扩展性。

Method: 两阶段方法：1) 查询嵌入和投影到向量空间，训练投影器和基于LLM的路由器重构原始查询；2) 在查询集上分析候选模型性能，路由器基于查询和模型性能的上下文向量预测模型是否能正确回答新查询。

Result: 在分布内和分布外任务中都实现了最先进的路由性能，且能够无缝集成新模型而无需重新训练路由器。

Conclusion: 该方法通过上下文向量有效表示模型能力，显著提升了路由性能并解决了模型扩展性问题。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often exhibit complementary strengths. Model
routing harnesses these strengths by dynamically directing each query to the
most suitable model, given a candidate model pool. However, routing performance
relies on accurate model representations, and adding new models typically
requires retraining, limiting scalability. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel routing method using in-context vectors to represent model
capabilities. The method proceeds in two stages. First, queries are embedded
and projected into vectors, with a projector and LLM-based router trained to
reconstruct the original queries, aligning vector representations with the
router's semantic space. Second, each candidate model is profiled on a query
set, and the router learns -- based on in-context vectors of query and model
performance -- to predict whether each model can correctly answer new queries.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
routing performance in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution tasks.
Moreover, our method allows for seamless integration of new models without
retraining the router. The code is available at

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Narrative Learning, a methodology where models

them against 7 baseline explainable machine learning models. We demonstrate
that on 5 out of 6 of these datasets, Narrative Learning became more accurate

Motivation: 大型语言模型生成过程模型解释时，从大型行为抽象（如直接跟随图或Petri网）生成解释计算成本高昂，需要寻找更高效的方法。

Method: 采用渐进行为输入减少策略：从固定日志的逐步缩小前缀中发现模型，使用LLM生成解释，再用第二个LLM评估解释的完整性、瓶颈识别和改进建议。

Result: 在合成日志上，适度减少输入时解释质量基本保持不变，表明存在实用的成本-质量权衡。

Conclusion: 该探索性研究表明，在资源受限环境中，通过渐进输入减少可以实现更高效的计算，同时保持LLM辅助过程分析的质量。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to generate textual
explanations of process models discovered from event logs. Producing
explanations from large behavioral abstractions (e.g., directly-follows graphs
or Petri nets) can be computationally expensive. This paper reports an
exploratory evaluation of explanation quality under progressive
behavioral-input reduction, where models are discovered from progressively
smaller prefixes of a fixed log. Our pipeline (i) discovers models at multiple
input sizes, (ii) prompts an LLM to generate explanations, and (iii) uses a
second LLM to assess completeness, bottleneck identification, and suggested
improvements. On synthetic logs, explanation quality is largely preserved under
moderate reduction, indicating a practical cost-quality trade-off. The study is
exploratory, as the scores are LLM-based (comparative signals rather than
ground truth) and the data are synthetic. The results suggest a path toward
more computationally efficient, LLM-assisted process analysis in
resource-constrained settings.

TL;DR: ARROW提出了一种自适应滚动多尺度时间路由方法，用于解决传统天气预测方法在建模时空依赖性和滚动策略方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据驱动的天气预测方法通常基于固定短时间间隔建模，依赖朴素自回归滚动进行长期预测，存在两个关键问题：(1) 难以充分建模全球天气系统的空间和多尺度时间依赖性；(2) 滚动策略难以平衡误差累积与精细大气变化捕捉。

Method: 构建多间隔预测模型，使用共享-私有专家混合机制捕获不同时间尺度的共享模式和特定特征，采用环形位置编码准确表示地球的纬度结构，并基于强化学习开发自适应滚动调度器来选择最合适的时间间隔。

Result: 实验结果表明ARROW在全球天气预测中达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: ARROW为全球天气预测领域建立了一个有前景的新范式。

Abstract: Weather forecasting is a fundamental task in spatiotemporal data analysis,
with broad applications across a wide range of domains. Existing data-driven
forecasting methods typically model atmospheric dynamics over a fixed short
time interval (e.g., 6 hours) and rely on naive autoregression-based rollout
for long-term forecasting (e.g., 138 hours). However, this paradigm suffers
from two key limitations: (1) it often inadequately models the spatial and
multi-scale temporal dependencies inherent in global weather systems, and (2)
the rollout strategy struggles to balance error accumulation with the capture
of fine-grained atmospheric variations. In this study, we propose ARROW, an
Adaptive-Rollout Multi-scale temporal Routing method for Global Weather
Forecasting. To contend with the first limitation, we construct a
multi-interval forecasting model that forecasts weather across different time
intervals. Within the model, the Shared-Private Mixture-of-Experts captures
both shared patterns and specific characteristics of atmospheric dynamics
across different time scales, while Ring Positional Encoding accurately encodes
the circular latitude structure of the Earth when representing spatial
information. For the second limitation, we develop an adaptive rollout
scheduler based on reinforcement learning, which selects the most suitable time
interval to forecast according to the current weather state. Experimental
results demonstrate that ARROW achieves state-of-the-art performance in global
weather forecasting, establishing a promising paradigm in this field.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业间关系识别对金融分析和公司治理至关重要，但面临数据规模大、稀疏性和上下文依赖等挑战。图方法能捕捉结构但缺乏语义深度，LLM擅长文本但表示关系依赖能力有限。

Method: 提出InterCorpRel-LLM跨模态框架，整合GNN与LLM，使用FactSet供应链记录构建专有数据集，设计三个训练任务：公司图匹配、行业分类和供应关系预测。

Result: 在供应关系识别任务中，F-score达到0.8543，显著优于GPT-5的0.2287，仅使用7B参数骨干网络和轻量训练。模型还能零样本泛化到竞争者识别。

Conclusion: 该框架为分析师和策略师提供了强大的工具，用于映射和推理复杂的企业网络，增强动态市场中的决策制定和风险管理能力。

Abstract: Identifying inter-firm relationships such as supply and competitive ties is
critical for financial analysis and corporate governance, yet remains
challenging due to the scale, sparsity, and contextual dependence of corporate
data. Graph-based methods capture structure but miss semantic depth, while
large language models (LLMs) excel at text but remain limited in their ability
to represent relational dependencies. To address this, we propose
InterCorpRel-LLM, a cross-modal framework that integrates GNNs with LLMs,
supported by a proprietary dataset derived from FactSet supply chain records
and three tailored training tasks: company graph matching, industry
classification, and supply relation prediction. This design enables effective
joint modeling of structure and semantics. Experiments show that
InterCorpRel-LLM substantially outperforms strong baselines, including GPT-5,
on a supply relation identification task, achieving an F-score of 0.8543 vs.
0.2287 with only a 7B-parameter backbone and lightweight training. The model
also generalizes to zero-shot competitor identification, underscoring its
ability to capture nuanced inter-firm dynamics. Our framework thus provides
analysts and strategists with a robust tool for mapping and reasoning about
complex corporate networks, enhancing decision-making and risk management in
dynamic markets.

Method: 从经典形容词列表使用机器学习构建人格模型，与Big Five模型对比分析100万条Reddit评论。

Result: Big Five模型（特别是宜人性、尽责性和神经质）在描述在线社区方面更强大且可解释，而机器学习聚类未能恢复外向性特质，缺乏心理测量一致性。

Conclusion: Big Five模型具有稳健性，人格的语义结构具有情境依赖性。机器学习可用于检验心理学理论的生态效度，但可能无法替代传统理论。

Abstract: The lexical hypothesis posits that personality traits are encoded in language
and is foundational to models like the Big Five. We created a bottom-up
personality model from a classic adjective list using machine learning and
compared its descriptive utility against the Big Five by analyzing one million
Reddit comments. The Big Five, particularly Agreeableness, Conscientiousness,
and Neuroticism, provided a far more powerful and interpretable description of
these online communities. In contrast, our machine-learning clusters provided
no meaningful distinctions, failed to recover the Extraversion trait, and
lacked the psychometric coherence of the Big Five. These results affirm the
robustness of the Big Five and suggest personality's semantic structure is
context-dependent. Our findings show that while machine learning can help check
the ecological validity of established psychological theories, it may not be
able to replace them.

TL;DR: 提出NCAL-R框架，利用深度网络的几何特性来提升主动学习的可靠性，通过类均值对齐扰动和特征波动两个信号来对抗噪声标签和数据分布偏移。

Motivation: 传统主动学习方法在标签噪声和数据分布偏移时不可靠，会放大错误标注和冗余样本的影响。

Method: 结合类均值对齐扰动评分（量化样本对类间几何结构的影响）和特征波动评分（捕捉表征的时间不稳定性）来选择样本。

Result: 在ImageNet-100和CIFAR100上实验表明，NCAL-R优于标准主动学习方法，在合成标签噪声下更鲁棒，对分布外数据泛化更强。

Conclusion: 将几何可靠性标准纳入样本选择策略可以使主动学习对标注错误和分布偏移更具鲁棒性。

Abstract: Active Learning (AL) promises to reduce annotation cost by prioritizing
informative samples, yet its reliability is undermined when labels are noisy or
when the data distribution shifts. In practice, annotators make mistakes, rare
categories are ambiguous, and conventional AL heuristics (uncertainty,
diversity) often amplify such errors by repeatedly selecting mislabeled or
redundant samples. We propose Reliable Active Learning via Neural Collapse
Geometry (NCAL-R), a framework that leverages the emergent geometric
regularities of deep networks to counteract unreliable supervision. Our method
introduces two complementary signals: (i) a Class-Mean Alignment Perturbation
score, which quantifies how candidate samples structurally stabilize or distort
inter-class geometry, and (ii) a Feature Fluctuation score, which captures
temporal instability of representations across training checkpoints. By
combining these signals, NCAL-R prioritizes samples that both preserve class
separation and highlight ambiguous regions, mitigating the effect of noisy or
redundant labels. Experiments on ImageNet-100 and CIFAR100 show that NCAL-R
consistently outperforms standard AL baselines, achieving higher accuracy with
fewer labels, improved robustness under synthetic label noise, and stronger
generalization to out-of-distribution data. These results suggest that
incorporating geometric reliability criteria into acquisition decisions can
make Active Learning less brittle to annotation errors and distribution shifts,
a key step toward trustworthy deployment in real-world labeling pipelines. Our
code is available at https://github.com/Vision-IIITD/NCAL.

TL;DR: ProtoMM是一个新颖的自监督学习框架，通过共享原型字典在多模态时间序列数据中建立共同嵌入空间，解决了传统对比学习方法过度拟合和误分类的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态方法依赖CLIP风格的对比目标，容易过度拟合到易于对齐的特征，并将有效的跨模态关系误分类为负样本，导致碎片化且不可泛化的嵌入表示。

Method: 引入共享原型字典，通过将表征聚类到共享原型周围而非显式负采样，在异构模态间建立共同嵌入空间，捕捉互补信息。

Result: ProtoMM在Pulse Motion基础模型中表现优于纯对比学习和先前的多模态SSL方法，实现了最先进的性能，并提高了学习特征的可解释性。

Conclusion: ProtoMM框架通过共享原型机制有效解决了多模态时间序列数据建模中的关键挑战，为生理信号提供了连贯的"共同语言"。

Abstract: Modeling multi-modal time-series data is critical for capturing system-level
dynamics, particularly in biosignals where modalities such as ECG, PPG, EDA,
and accelerometry provide complementary perspectives on interconnected
physiological processes. While recent self-supervised learning (SSL) advances
have improved unimodal representation learning, existing multi-modal approaches
often rely on CLIP-style contrastive objectives that overfit to easily aligned
features and misclassify valid cross-modal relationships as negatives,
resulting in fragmented and non-generalizable embeddings. To overcome these
limitations, we propose ProtoMM, a novel SSL framework that introduces a shared
prototype dictionary to anchor heterogeneous modalities in a common embedding
space. By clustering representations around shared prototypes rather than
explicit negative sampling, our method captures complementary information
across modalities and provides a coherent "common language" for physiological
signals. In this work, we focus on developing a Pulse Motion foundation model
with ProtoMM and demonstrate that our approach outperforms contrastive-only and
prior multimodal SSL methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance while
offering improved interpretability of learned features.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图Transformer在异构图上存在两个主要问题：1）二次计算复杂度限制了可扩展性；2）无法有效建模异构语义，导致语义混合。需要一种既能捕获长程依赖又能在异构图上高效运行的方法。

Result: 在四个真实世界异构图数据集上的实验表明，HeSRN在节点分类任务上持续优于最先进的异构图神经网络和图Transformer基线，实现了更高的准确率和显著降低的计算复杂度。

Conclusion: HeSRN通过槽感知结构和保持机制，有效解决了异构图表示学习中的语义混合和计算效率问题，为大规模异构图分析提供了高效且表达力强的解决方案。

Abstract: Graph Transformers have recently achieved remarkable progress in graph
representation learning by capturing long-range dependencies through
self-attention. However, their quadratic computational complexity and inability
to effectively model heterogeneous semantics severely limit their scalability
and generalization on real-world heterogeneous graphs. To address these issues,
we propose HeSRN, a novel Heterogeneous Slot-aware Retentive Network for
efficient and expressive heterogeneous graph representation learning. HeSRN
introduces a slot-aware structure encoder that explicitly disentangles
node-type semantics by projecting heterogeneous features into independent slots
and aligning their distributions through slot normalization and retention-based
fusion, effectively mitigating the semantic entanglement caused by forced
feature-space unification in previous Transformer-based models. Furthermore, we
replace the self-attention mechanism with a retention-based encoder, which
models structural and contextual dependencies in linear time complexity while
maintaining strong expressive power. A heterogeneous retentive encoder is
further employed to jointly capture both local structural signals and global
heterogeneous semantics through multi-scale retention layers. Extensive
experiments on four real-world heterogeneous graph datasets demonstrate that
HeSRN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art heterogeneous graph neural
networks and Graph Transformer baselines on node classification tasks,
achieving superior accuracy with significantly lower computational complexity.

TL;DR: 该论文通过经验研究证明，在几何任务中，等变性架构比非等变性架构具有更好的缩放性能，且高阶表示能带来更好的缩放指数。研究还表明，为达到计算最优训练，数据和模型大小应同步缩放。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在验证等变性（equivariance）在几何任务中的重要性，特别是在大规模场景下，探究对称性等基本归纳偏置对任务难度和缩放规律的影响。

Method: 采用经验研究方法，在几何任务（学习原子间势能）中比较等变性和非等变性架构的缩放行为，分析数据、参数和计算量的幂律缩放关系。

Result: 发现等变性架构比非等变性架构缩放更好，且高阶表示能带来更好的缩放指数。同时表明数据和模型大小应同步缩放以实现计算最优训练。

Conclusion: 研究挑战了传统观念，表明不应让模型自行发现对称性等基本归纳偏置，特别是在大规模场景下，因为这些偏置会改变任务的内在难度和缩放规律。

Abstract: We present an empirical study in the geometric task of learning interatomic
potentials, which shows equivariance matters even more at larger scales; we
show a clear power-law scaling behaviour with respect to data, parameters and
compute with ``architecture-dependent exponents''. In particular, we observe
that equivariant architectures, which leverage task symmetry, scale better than
non-equivariant models. Moreover, among equivariant architectures, higher-order
representations translate to better scaling exponents. Our analysis also
suggests that for compute-optimal training, the data and model sizes should
scale in tandem regardless of the architecture. At a high level, these results
suggest that, contrary to common belief, we should not leave it to the model to
discover fundamental inductive biases such as symmetry, especially as we scale,
because they change the inherent difficulty of the task and its scaling laws.

Abstract: Fingerprinting Radio Frequency (RF) emitters typically involves finding
unique emitter characteristics that are featured in their transmitted signals.
These fingerprints are nuanced but sufficiently detailed, motivating the
pursuit of methods that can successfully extract them. The most granular
downstream task is known as Specific Emitter Identification (SEI), which
requires a well informed RF fingerprinting (RFF) approach for it to be
successful. RFF and SEI have a long history, with numerous application areas in
defence and civilian contexts such as signal intelligence, electronic
surveillance, physical-layer authentication of wireless communication devices,
to name a few. RFF methods also support many other downstream tasks such as
Emitter Data Association (EDA) and RF Emitter Clustering (RFEC) and are
applicable to a range of transmission types. In recent years, data-driven
approaches have become popular in the RFF domain due to their ability to
automatically learn intricate fingerprints from raw data. These methods
generally deliver superior performance when compared to traditional techniques.
The more traditional approaches are often labour-intensive, inflexible and only
applicable to a particular emitter type or transmission scheme. Therefore, we
consider data-driven Machine Learning (ML)-enabled RFF. In particular, we
propose a generic framework for ML-enabled RFF which is inclusive of several
popular downstream tasks such as SEI, EDA and RFEC. Each task is formulated as
a RF fingerprint-dependent task. A variety of use cases using real RF datasets
are presented here to demonstrate the framework for a range of tasks and
application areas, such as spaceborne surveillance, signal intelligence and
countering drones.

Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在时间序列预测中广泛应用，但经验表明Transformer往往无法超越简单线性模型。本文旨在从理论角度深入理解这一现象。

Method: 通过In-Context Learning理论分析，在AR(p)数据假设下，建立了线性自注意力模型的理论框架，并分析了其渐近行为和CoT推理的数学特性。

Result: 理论证明：(1)线性自注意力模型无法获得比经典线性模型更低的MSE；(2)当上下文长度趋近无穷时，LSA渐近恢复最优线性预测器；(3)在CoT推理下，预测会指数级崩溃到均值。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了Transformer在时间序列预测中的根本理论限制，为设计更有效的预测架构提供了实践洞见，呼吁社区重新审视复杂架构的直接应用。

Abstract: Time series forecasting (TSF) remains a challenging and largely unsolved
problem in machine learning, despite significant recent efforts leveraging
Large Language Models (LLMs), which predominantly rely on Transformer
architectures. Empirical evidence consistently shows that even powerful
Transformers often fail to outperform much simpler models, e.g., linear models,
on TSF tasks; however, a rigorous theoretical understanding of this phenomenon
remains limited. In this paper, we provide a theoretical analysis of
Transformers' limitations for TSF through the lens of In-Context Learning (ICL)
theory. Specifically, under AR($p$) data, we establish that: (1) Linear
Self-Attention (LSA) models $\textit{cannot}$ achieve lower expected MSE than
classical linear models for in-context forecasting; (2) as the context length
approaches to infinity, LSA asymptotically recovers the optimal linear
predictor; and (3) under Chain-of-Thought (CoT) style inference, predictions
collapse to the mean exponentially. We empirically validate these findings
through carefully designed experiments. Our theory not only sheds light on
several previously underexplored phenomena but also offers practical insights
for designing more effective forecasting architectures. We hope our work
encourages the broader research community to revisit the fundamental
theoretical limitations of TSF and to critically evaluate the direct
application of increasingly sophisticated architectures without deeper
scrutiny.

Abstract: Time series AI is crucial for analyzing dynamic web content, driving a surge
of pre-trained large models known for their strong knowledge encoding and
transfer capabilities across diverse tasks. However, given their
energy-intensive training, inference, and hardware demands, using large models
as a one-fits-all solution raises serious concerns about carbon footprint and
sustainability. For a specific task, a compact yet specialized, high-performing
model may be more practical and affordable, especially for resource-constrained
users such as small businesses. This motivates the question: Can we build
cost-effective lightweight models with large-model-like performance on core
tasks such as forecasting? This paper addresses this question by introducing
SVTime, a novel Small model inspired by large Vision model (LVM) forecasters
for long-term Time series forecasting (LTSF). Recently, LVMs have been shown as
powerful tools for LTSF. We identify a set of key inductive biases of LVM
forecasters -- analogous to the "physics" governing their behaviors in LTSF --
and design small models that encode these biases through meticulously crafted
linear layers and constraint functions. Across 21 baselines spanning
lightweight, complex, and pre-trained large models on 8 benchmark datasets,
SVTime outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) lightweight models and rivals large
models with 10^3 fewer parameters than LVMs, while enabling efficient training
and inference in low-resource settings.

Abstract: While LLM agents can plan multi-step tasks, intervening at the planning
stage-before any action is executed-is often the safest way to prevent harm,
since certain risks can lead to severe consequences once carried out. However,
existing guardrails mostly operate post-execution, which is difficult to scale
and leaves little room for controllable supervision at the plan level. To
address this challenge, we highlight three critical gaps in current research:
data gap, model gap, and evaluation gap. To close the data gap, we introduce
AuraGen, a controllable engine that (i) synthesizes benign trajectories, (ii)
injects category-labeled risks with calibrated difficulty, and (iii) filters
outputs via an automated reward model, producing large and reliable corpora for
pre-execution safety. To close the guardian model gap, we propose a
foundational guardrail Safiron, combining a cross-planner adapter with a
compact guardian model. The adapter unifies different input formats, while
Safiron flags risky cases, assigns risk types, and generates rationales;
trained in two stages with a broadly explored data recipe, Safiron achieves
robust transfer across settings. To close the evaluation gap, we release
Pre-Exec Bench, a realistic benchmark covering diverse tools and branching
trajectories, which measures detection, fine-grained categorization,
explanation, and cross-planner generalization in human-verified scenarios.
Extensive experiments demonstrate consistent gains of the proposed guardrail
over strong baselines on Pre-Exec Bench, and ablations further distill
actionable practices, providing a practical template for safer agentic systems.

Conclusion: 该方法通过熵视角的理论分析证明能够促进生成样本的多样性，为不平衡分类问题提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Oversampling is one of the most widely used approaches for addressing
imbalanced classification. The core idea is to generate additional minority
samples to rebalance the dataset. Most existing methods, such as SMOTE, require
converting categorical variables into numerical vectors, which often leads to
information loss. Recently, large language model (LLM)-based methods have been
introduced to overcome this limitation. However, current LLM-based approaches
typically generate minority samples with limited diversity, reducing robustness
and generalizability in downstream classification tasks. To address this gap,
we propose a novel LLM-based oversampling method designed to enhance diversity.
First, we introduce a sampling strategy that conditions synthetic sample
generation on both minority labels and features. Second, we develop a new
permutation strategy for fine-tuning pre-trained LLMs. Third, we fine-tune the
LLM not only on minority samples but also on interpolated samples to further
enrich variability. Extensive experiments on 10 tabular datasets demonstrate
that our method significantly outperforms eight SOTA baselines. The generated
synthetic samples are both realistic and diverse. Moreover, we provide
theoretical analysis through an entropy-based perspective, proving that our
method encourages diversity in the generated samples.

Abstract: Generative modeling becomes increasingly data-intensive in high-dimensional
spaces. In molecular science, where data collection is expensive and important
events are rare, compression to lower-dimensional manifolds is especially
important for various downstream tasks, including generation. We combine a
time-lagged information bottleneck designed to characterize molecular important
representations and a diffusion model in one joint training objective. The
resulting protocol, which we term Diffusive State Predictive Information
Bottleneck (D-SPIB), enables the balancing of representation learning and
generation aims in one flexible architecture. Additionally, the model is
capable of combining temperature information from different molecular
simulation trajectories to learn a coherent and useful internal representation
of thermodynamics. We benchmark D-SPIB on multiple molecular tasks and showcase
its potential for exploring physical conditions outside the training set.

Abstract: Neural operators are becoming the default tools to learn solutions to
governing partial differential equations (PDEs) in weather and ocean
forecasting applications. Despite early promising achievements, significant
challenges remain, including long-term prediction stability and adherence to
physical laws, particularly for high-frequency processes. In this paper, we
take a step toward addressing these challenges in high-resolution ocean
prediction by incorporating temporal Fourier modes, demonstrating how this
modification enhances physical fidelity. This study compares the standard
Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) with its variant, FNOtD, which has been modified
to internalize the dispersion relation while learning the solution operator for
ocean PDEs. The results demonstrate that entangling space and time in the
training of integral kernels enables the model to capture multiscale wave
propagation and effectively learn ocean dynamics. FNOtD substantially improves
long-term prediction stability and consistency with underlying physical
dynamics in challenging high-frequency settings compared to the standard FNO.
It also provides competitive predictive skill relative to a state-of-the-art
numerical ocean model, while requiring significantly lower computational cost.

Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability seeks to uncover how internal components of
neural networks give rise to predictions. A persistent challenge, however, is
disentangling two often conflated notions: decodability--the recoverability of
information from hidden states--and causality--the extent to which those states
functionally influence outputs. In this work, we investigate their relationship
in vision transformers (ViTs) fine-tuned for object counting. Using activation
patching, we test the causal role of spatial and CLS tokens by transplanting
activations across clean-corrupted image pairs. In parallel, we train linear
probes to assess the decodability of count information at different depths. Our
results reveal systematic mismatches: middle-layer object tokens exert strong
causal influence despite being weakly decodable, whereas final-layer object
tokens support accurate decoding yet are functionally inert. Similarly, the CLS
token becomes decodable in mid-layers but only acquires causal power in the
final layers. These findings highlight that decodability and causality reflect
complementary dimensions of representation--what information is present versus
what is used--and that their divergence can expose hidden computational

*Xiaoyu Wang,Alexandra Valavanis,Azhir Mahmood,Andreas Mang,Martin Benning,Audrey Repetti*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种统一的提升训练框架，通过将嵌套优化问题转化为高维约束优化问题，使用惩罚项替代直接约束，解决了传统梯度训练中的梯度消失/爆炸、非光滑激活函数和串行结构等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于梯度的深度神经网络训练面临梯度消失/爆炸、非光滑激活函数处理困难以及串行结构限制并行化等问题，需要开发替代的训练方法。

Method: 采用提升训练策略，包括辅助坐标法、Fenchel提升网络和提升Bregman训练，将嵌套优化转化为高维约束优化问题，利用Bregman距离等凸优化工具，实现分布式优化并处理非光滑激活函数。

Result: 数值实验表明，提升Bregman方法在标准成像任务中比传统训练更有效和稳定，特别是在使用近端激活函数的架构中表现优异。

Conclusion: 提升训练框架为深度神经网络训练提供了有效的替代方案，能够改善训练景观条件，支持分布式优化，并更好地处理非光滑激活函数。

Abstract: The training of deep neural networks predominantly relies on a combination of
gradient-based optimisation and back-propagation for the computation of the
gradient. While incredibly successful, this approach faces challenges such as
vanishing or exploding gradients, difficulties with non-smooth activations, and
an inherently sequential structure that limits parallelisation. Lifted training
methods offer an alternative by reformulating the nested optimisation problem
into a higher-dimensional, constrained optimisation problem where the
constraints are no longer enforced directly but penalised with penalty terms.
This chapter introduces a unified framework that encapsulates various lifted
training strategies, including the Method of Auxiliary Coordinates, Fenchel
Lifted Networks, and Lifted Bregman Training, and demonstrates how diverse
architectures, such as Multi-Layer Perceptrons, Residual Neural Networks, and
Proximal Neural Networks fit within this structure. By leveraging tools from
convex optimisation, particularly Bregman distances, the framework facilitates
distributed optimisation, accommodates non-differentiable proximal activations,
and can improve the conditioning of the training landscape. We discuss the
implementation of these methods using block-coordinate descent strategies,
including deterministic implementations enhanced by accelerated and adaptive
optimisation techniques, as well as implicit stochastic gradient methods.
Furthermore, we explore the application of this framework to inverse problems,
detailing methodologies for both the training of specialised networks (e.g.,
unrolled architectures) and the stable inversion of pre-trained networks.
Numerical results on standard imaging tasks validate the effectiveness and
stability of the lifted Bregman approach compared to conventional training,
particularly for architectures employing proximal activations.

*Jeffrey Camlin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种称为"时间提升"的潜在空间自适应时间重参数化方法，用于连续时间动力系统，通过平滑单调映射正则化流场的近奇异行为并保持守恒律。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决连续时间动力系统中近奇异行为的正则化问题，同时保持系统的守恒律，为机器学习动力学提供稳定化的时间归一化方法。

Method: 引入平滑单调映射t↦τ(t)进行时间重参数化，在提升坐标中使轨迹全局光滑化，作为连续时间归一化或时间扭曲算子。

Result: 该方法能使不可压缩Navier-Stokes方程在环面T³上的轨迹变得全局光滑，并能稳定物理信息神经网络和其他潜在流架构。

Conclusion: 时间提升框架将解析正则性理论与表示学习方法联系起来，为刚性或湍流过程提供了有效的表示学习工具。

Abstract: We present a latent-space formulation of adaptive temporal reparametrization
for continuous-time dynamical systems. The method, called *temporal lifting*,
introduces a smooth monotone mapping $t \mapsto \tau(t)$ that regularizes
near-singular behavior of the underlying flow while preserving its conservation
laws. In the lifted coordinate, trajectories such as those of the
incompressible Navier-Stokes equations on the torus $\mathbb{T}^3$ become
globally smooth. From the standpoint of machine-learning dynamics, temporal
lifting acts as a continuous-time normalization or time-warping operator that
can stabilize physics-informed neural networks and other latent-flow
architectures used in AI systems. The framework links analytic regularity
theory with representation-learning methods for stiff or turbulent processes.

TL;DR: Decomposer Networks (DecompNet) 是一种语义自编码器，通过并行分支和残差输入分解输入为多个可解释组件，实现组件间的显式竞争。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自编码器将输入压缩为单一潜在表示，而DecompNet旨在分解输入为多个语义上有意义的组件，提供更丰富的解释性。

Method: 使用N个并行分支，每个分支的残差输入定义为原始信号减去其他所有分支的重建结果，通过展开Gauss-Seidel风格块坐标下降为可微分网络。

Result: DecompNet实现了组件间的显式竞争，产生了简洁且语义上有意义的表示。

Conclusion: DecompNet是第一个实现全除一残差更新规则的语义自编码器，在可解释性分解方面具有创新性。

Abstract: We propose the Decomposer Networks (DecompNet), a semantic autoencoder that
factorizes an input into multiple interpretable components. Unlike classical
autoencoders that compress an input into a single latent representation, the
Decomposer Network maintains N parallel branches, each assigned a residual
input defined as the original signal minus the reconstructions of all other
branches. By unrolling a Gauss--Seidel style block-coordinate descent into a
differentiable network, DecompNet enforce explicit competition among
components, yielding parsimonious, semantically meaningful representations. We
situate our model relative to linear decomposition methods (PCA, NMF), deep
unrolled optimization, and object-centric architectures (MONet, IODINE, Slot
Attention), and highlight its novelty as the first semantic autoencoder to
implement an all-but-one residual update rule.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文系统探索了神经网络中梯度下降方法的规范选择问题，提出了新的MuonMax优化器及其与Momo结合的变体，显著提高了超参数鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了在神经网络中定义最速下降方法，需要为每层选择规范、跨层聚合规范的方式以及是否使用归一化。现有方法如Adam和Muon在超参数敏感性方面存在不足。

Method: 系统探索跨层规范聚合的不同替代方案，将Adam和Muon形式化为非欧几里得梯度下降类型，并推导Muon优化器的新变体。将非欧几里得梯度方法与模型动量(Momo)结合。

Result: 发现Muon对学习率选择敏感，而新变体MuonMax显著更鲁棒。Momo变体的Muon对超参数调优更鲁棒，通常获得更好的验证分数。

Conclusion: 对于新任务，建议使用Momo与MuonMax组合，以节省昂贵的超参数调优成本。

Abstract: To define a steepest descent method over a neural network, we need to choose
a norm for each layer, a way to aggregate these norms across layers, and
whether to use normalization. We systematically explore different alternatives
for aggregating norms across layers, both formalizing existing combinations of
Adam and the recently proposed Muon as a type of non-Euclidean gradient
descent, and deriving new variants of the Muon optimizer. Through a
comprehensive experimental evaluation of the optimizers within our framework,
we find that Muon is sensitive to the choice of learning rate, whereas a new
variant we call MuonMax is significantly more robust. We then show how to
combine any non-Euclidean gradient method with model based momentum (known as
Momo). The new Momo variants of Muon are significantly more robust to
hyperparameter tuning, and often achieve a better validation score. Thus for
new tasks, where the optimal hyperparameters are not known, we advocate for
using Momo in combination with MuonMax to save on costly hyperparameter tuning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CALM是一个专门为表格数据设计的因果分析语言模型，通过Mamba架构识别变量间的因果模式，在模拟研究和真实世界应用中显著优于现有方法，准确率超过91%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有因果发现方法存在无法确定因果方向、仅限于线性关联、对忠实性假设敏感、在大假设空间中搜索效率低等问题，而大语言模型虽具备强大推理能力但不适合表格数据格式。

Method: 采用Mamba架构的CALM模型，整合局部因果分数、条件独立性检验和关系属性等证据，在合成数据和10个真实生物数据集上进行训练，捕捉线性和非线性因果机制。

Result: 在模拟研究中准确率超过91%，在丙型肝炎病毒进展的因果因素识别中表现优异，显著优于PC、causalMGM和NOTEARS等现有方法。

Conclusion: CALM成功将语言模型的模式识别能力应用于表格数据的因果发现，为实现准确且可泛化的因果分析迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: Causal discovery from observational data is fundamental to scientific fields
like biology, where controlled experiments are often impractical. However,
existing methods, including constraint-based (e.g., PC, causalMGM) and
score-based approaches (e.g., NOTEARS), face significant limitations. These
include an inability to resolve causal direction, restrictions to linear
associations, sensitivity to violations of the faithfulness assumption, and
inefficiency in searching vast hypothesis spaces. While large language models
(LLMs) offer powerful reasoning capabilities, their application is hindered by
a fundamental discrepancy: they are designed for text, while most causal data
is tabular. To address these challenges, we introduce CALM, a novel causal
analysis language model specifically designed for tabular data in complex
systems. CALM leverages a Mamba-based architecture to classify causal patterns
from pairwise variable relationships. It integrates a comprehensive suite of
evidence, including local causal scores, conditional independence tests, and
relational attributes, to capture a wide spectrum of linear, nonlinear, and
conditional causal mechanisms. Trained on a diverse corpus of synthetic data
(from linear, mixed, and nonlinear models) and 10 real-world biological
datasets with rigorously validated causal relationships, our model ensures
robustness and generalizability. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that CALM
significantly outperforms existing methods in both simulation studies,
achieving over 91% accuracy, and in a real-world application identifying causal
factors in Hepatitis C virus progression. This work represents a significant
step towards accurate and generalizable causal discovery by successfully
adapting the pattern recognition capabilities of language models to the
intricacies of tabular data.

TL;DR: ProxRouter是一种非参数化查询路由器，通过指数倾斜聚合机制平衡偏差和方差，提高对异常查询的路由鲁棒性，同时保持正常查询性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有参数化路由器需要重新训练和维护，非参数化路由器虽然无需训练但难以处理异常查询，且训练集多样性有限且更新成本高。

Method: 采用指数倾斜聚合机制来平衡非参数化路由器中的偏差和方差，提高对异常查询的鲁棒性。

Result: 实验表明ProxRouter在保持正常查询性能的同时，显著提升了异常查询的路由效果，且开销极小。

Conclusion: ProxRouter通过创新的聚合机制有效解决了非参数化路由器在异常查询上的泛化问题，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) query routers are critical to modern AI platforms
as they seek to improve efficiency by assigning inference queries to accurate,
yet low-cost models. Parametric routers typically use trained neural networks
for LLM selection but suffer from retraining and maintenance overheads.
Nonparametric routers are training-free, instead estimating LLM accuracy and
cost via similarity between encodings of the input query and training set
queries. However, like their parametric counterparts, nonparametric routers
struggle to generalize to outlier queries, an issue exacerbated by limited
diversity in training sets which are costly to expand and difficult to keep
current with ever-evolving use cases. We propose ProxRouter, which applies an
exponentially tilted aggregation mechanism to balance bias and variance in
nonparametric routers, improving their robustness to outliers. Experiments show
ProxRouter enhances outlier routing while preserving inlier performance with
minimal overhead.

TL;DR: WARC-Bench是一个新的网页导航基准测试，包含438个任务，专注于评估AI代理在网页子任务上的表现。研究发现现有模型在该基准上表现不佳，通过监督微调和强化学习训练可以提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有网页导航基准主要关注长时程任务，而忽略了短时程的子任务（如日期选择器操作、滚动容器等），这些子任务对网页导航的鲁棒性至关重要。

Method: 使用Web ARChive文件创建沙盒化的动态网页交互环境，探索监督微调(SFT)和基于可验证奖励的强化学习(RLVR)两种训练方法。

Result: 领先的计算机使用模型在WARC-Bench上的最高成功率仅为64.8%。SFT模型达到48.8%成功率，RLVR在SFT基础上进一步提升到52.8%，优于许多前沿模型。

Conclusion: 掌握网页子任务对鲁棒网页规划和导航至关重要，这是现有基准测试未充分评估的能力。

Abstract: Training web agents to navigate complex, real-world websites requires them to
master $\textit{subtasks}$ - short-horizon interactions on multiple UI
components (e.g., choosing the correct date in a date picker, or scrolling in a
container to extract information). We introduce WARC-Bench (Web Archive
Benchmark), a novel web navigation benchmark featuring 438 tasks designed to
evaluate multimodal AI agents on subtasks. WARC-Bench enables sandboxed
interactions with dynamic and realistic webpages using Web ARChive files. We
show that WARC-Bench is challenging for leading computer-use models, with the
highest observed success rate being 64.8%. To improve open source models on
subtask, we explore two common training techniques: supervised fine-tuning
(SFT) and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR). Experiments
show that SFT models obtain a 48.8% success rate on the benchmark. Training
with RLVR over SFT checkpoints, even in data-scarce settings, improves the
score to 52.8% on WARC-Bench, outperforming many frontier models. Our analysis
concludes that mastering these subtasks is essential for robust web planning
and navigation, and is a capability not extensively evaluated by existing
benchmarks.

Motivation: 现有的主动学习获取函数众多，但缺乏统一的理论指导，且在大批量场景下存在计算困难或性能下降的问题。

Method: 基于贝叶斯决策理论推导主动学习算法，包括EER、EPIG等，并针对批量扩展问题提出了ParBaLS方法。

Result: 实验表明ParBaLS EPIG在固定预算和贝叶斯逻辑回归神经网络嵌入上优于其他方法。

Conclusion: 贝叶斯决策理论为主动学习提供了统一框架，ParBaLS方法有效解决了批量主动学习的扩展性问题。

Abstract: Over the past couple of decades, many active learning acquisition functions
have been proposed, leaving practitioners with an unclear choice of which to
use. Bayesian Decision Theory (BDT) offers a universal principle to guide
decision-making. In this work, we derive BDT for (Bayesian) active learning in
the myopic framework, where we imagine we only have one more point to label.
This derivation leads to effective algorithms such as Expected Error Reduction
(EER), Expected Predictive Information Gain (EPIG), and other algorithms that
appear in the literature. Furthermore, we show that BAIT (active learning based
on V-optimal experimental design) can be derived from BDT and asymptotic
approximations. A key challenge of such methods is the difficult scaling to
large batch sizes, leading to either computational challenges (BatchBALD) or
dramatic performance drops (top-$B$ selection). Here, using a particular
formulation of the decision process, we derive Partial Batch Label Sampling
(ParBaLS) for the EPIG algorithm. We show experimentally for several datasets
that ParBaLS EPIG gives superior performance for a fixed budget and Bayesian
Logistic Regression on Neural Embeddings. Our code is available at

Motivation: 现有连续时间方法面临三个关键挑战：节点特定记忆依赖导致嵌入过时、未能显式捕捉邻居节点间相关性、无法充分捕捉演化图的结构动态。

Method: 提出TAWRMAC框架，整合时间匿名游走重启机制、记忆增强GNN和邻居共现嵌入，通过固定时间编码增强嵌入稳定性，显式捕捉邻居相关性，区分重复交互和新建连接。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，TAWRMAC在动态链接预测和节点分类任务中，在转导和归纳设置下均优于最先进方法，且对三种不同负采样策略均表现一致。

Conclusion: TAWRMAC通过提供稳定、可泛化和上下文感知的嵌入，推进了连续时间动态图学习的技术水平。

Abstract: Dynamic graph representation learning has become essential for analyzing
evolving networks in domains such as social network analysis, recommendation
systems, and traffic analysis. However, existing continuous-time methods face
three key challenges: (1) some methods depend solely on node-specific memory
without effectively incorporating information from neighboring nodes, resulting
in embedding staleness; (2) most fail to explicitly capture correlations
between node neighborhoods, limiting contextual awareness; and (3) many fail to
fully capture the structural dynamics of evolving graphs, especially in absence
of rich link attributes. To address these limitations, we introduce TAWRMAC-a
novel framework that integrates Temporal Anonymous Walks with Restart, Memory
Augmentation, and Neighbor Co-occurrence embedding. TAWRMAC enhances embedding
stability through a memory-augmented GNN with fixedtime encoding and improves
contextual representation by explicitly capturing neighbor correlations.
Additionally, its Temporal Anonymous Walks with Restart mechanism distinguishes
between nodes exhibiting repetitive interactions and those forming new
connections beyond their immediate neighborhood. This approach captures
structural dynamics better and supports strong inductive learning. Extensive
experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that TAWRMAC
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in dynamic link prediction
and node classification under both transductive and inductive settings across
three different negative sampling strategies. By providing stable,
generalizable, and context-aware embeddings, TAWRMAC advances the state of the
art in continuous-time dynamic graph learning. The code is available at

TL;DR: 本文研究了在重尾噪声下的稳健非参数回归，使用Huber回归作为示例，提出了基于预测误差（L2距离）的学习性度量方法，建立了新的比较定理和有限样本误差界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于泛化误差的稳健损失分析不能准确反映样本外性能，且在处理无界函数空间和重尾噪声时存在挑战，需要新的分析框架。

Method: 使用Tikhonov正则化风险最小化在再生核希尔伯特空间中，引入概率有效假设空间，建立稳健风险与预测误差的比较定理，推导有限样本误差界。

Result: 建立了新的比较定理，将超额稳健风险与L2预测误差联系起来，推导出Huber回归在RKHS中的显式有限样本误差界和收敛率，无需均匀有界性假设。

Conclusion: 预测误差而非超额泛化风险应作为分析稳健学习的基本视角，研究提供了原则性的调参规则，并可扩展到其他稳健损失函数。

Abstract: We investigate robust nonparametric regression in the presence of
heavy-tailed noise, where the hypothesis class may contain unbounded functions
and robustness is ensured via a robust loss function $\ell_\sigma$. Using Huber
regression as a close-up example within Tikhonov-regularized risk minimization
in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS), we address two central challenges:
(i) the breakdown of standard concentration tools under weak moment
assumptions, and (ii) the analytical difficulties introduced by unbounded
hypothesis spaces. Our first message is conceptual: conventional
generalization-error bounds for robust losses do not faithfully capture
out-of-sample performance. We argue that learnability should instead be
quantified through prediction error, namely the $L_2$-distance to the truth
$f^\star$, which is $\sigma$-independent and directly reflects the target of
robust estimation. To make this workable under unboundedness, we introduce a
\emph{probabilistic effective hypothesis space} that confines the estimator
with high probability and enables a meaningful bias--variance decomposition
under weak $(1+\epsilon)$-moment conditions. Technically, we establish new
comparison theorems linking the excess robust risk to the $L_2$ prediction
error up to a residual of order $\mathcal{O}(\sigma^{-2\epsilon})$, clarifying
the robustness--bias trade-off induced by the scale parameter $\sigma$.
Building on this, we derive explicit finite-sample error bounds and convergence
rates for Huber regression in RKHS that hold without uniform boundedness and
under heavy-tailed noise. Our study delivers principled tuning rules, extends
beyond Huber to other robust losses, and highlights prediction error, not
excess generalization risk, as the fundamental lens for analyzing robust
learning.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的北极海冰浓度季节性预测系统存在系统性偏差和复杂时空误差，传统确定性后处理方法局限于有限集合成员，无法充分量化不确定性，而决策制定需要准确的不确定性评估。

Method: 使用条件变分自编码器模型，学习给定有偏差模型预测条件下观测数据的条件分布，从而生成大规模调整后的预报集合。

Result: 调整后的预报在校准度、与观测分布的接近程度以及误差方面均优于传统气候平均调整预报，在确定性和概率性指标上表现更好。

Conclusion: 基于条件变分自编码器的概率误差校正框架能够有效改善北极海冰浓度季节性预测的质量，为决策提供更可靠的不确定性量化。

Abstract: Seasonal forecast of Arctic sea ice concentration is key to mitigate the
negative impact and assess potential opportunities posed by the rapid decline
of sea ice coverage. Seasonal prediction systems based on climate models often
show systematic biases and complex spatio-temporal errors that grow with the
forecasts. Consequently, operational predictions are routinely bias corrected
and calibrated using retrospective forecasts. For predictions of Arctic sea ice
concentration, error corrections are mainly based on one-to-one post-processing
methods including climatological mean or linear regression correction and, more
recently, machine learning. Such deterministic adjustments are confined at best
to the limited number of costly-to-run ensemble members of the raw forecast.
However, decision-making requires proper quantification of uncertainty and
likelihood of events, particularly of extremes. We introduce a probabilistic
error correction framework based on a conditional Variational Autoencoder model
to map the conditional distribution of observations given the biased model
prediction. This method naturally allows for generating large ensembles of
adjusted forecasts. We evaluate our model using deterministic and probabilistic
metrics and show that the adjusted forecasts are better calibrated, closer to
the observational distribution, and have smaller errors than climatological
mean adjusted forecasts.

TL;DR: 提出Chain-of-Influence (CoI)框架，通过多层注意力机制显式建模临床特征间的时间演化依赖关系，提供可解释的预测路径追踪。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法无法显式建模临床变量间随时间变化的潜在依赖关系，缺乏对特征影响传播机制的解释性。

Method: 使用双层注意力架构：时间注意力层识别关键时间点，跨特征注意力层建模特征间的有向影响传播，构建时间展开的影响图。

Result: 在MIMIC-IV数据集和慢性肾病队列上，CoI在预测准确性上显著优于现有方法，并能揭示临床有意义的疾病进展模式。

Conclusion: CoI框架不仅提升了预测性能，更重要的是提供了前所未有的透明度，能够追踪特征影响路径，支持临床决策。

Abstract: Modeling clinical time-series data is hampered by the challenge of capturing
latent, time-varying dependencies among features. State-of-the-art approaches
often rely on black-box mechanisms or simple aggregation, failing to explicitly
model how the influence of one clinical variable propagates through others over
time. We propose $\textbf{Chain-of-Influence (CoI)}$, an interpretable deep
learning framework that constructs an explicit, time-unfolded graph of feature
interactions. CoI leverages a multi-level attention architecture: first, a
temporal attention layer identifies critical time points in a patient's record;
second, a cross-feature attention layer models the directed influence from
features at these time points to subsequent features. This design enables the
tracing of influence pathways, providing a granular audit trail that shows how
any feature at any time contributes to the final prediction, both directly and
through its influence on other variables. We evaluate CoI on mortality and
disease progression tasks using the MIMIC-IV dataset and a private chronic
kidney disease cohort. Our framework significantly outperforms existing methods
in predictive accuracy. More importantly, through case studies, we show that
CoI can uncover clinically meaningful, patient-specific patterns of disease
progression that are opaque to other models, offering unprecedented
transparency into the temporal and cross-feature dependencies that inform
clinical decision-making.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PyTorch和JAX虽然都嵌入在Python中，但在核心设计、执行语义和生态系统成熟度上存在差异。JAX较新，公开代码相对较少，且并行PyTorch-JAX语料库有限，现有评估方法在跨框架基准测试方面存在不足。

Conclusion: T2J框架通过结构化指导和增强提示，有效解决了PyTorch到JAX代码翻译的挑战，显著提升了翻译质量和效率。

Abstract: Despite recent progress of large language models (LLMs) on code translation
among mainstream languages, translating PyTorch to JAX remains nontrivial. The
two libraries, though both embedded in Python, differ in core design, execution
semantics, and ecosystem maturity; JAX is newer and comparatively
underrepresented in public code, and parallel PyTorch--JAX corpora are limited.
Weaknesses in existing evaluation further complicate cross-framework
benchmarking. We present T2J, a prompt-augmentation framework that strengthens
LLM-based PyTorch to JAX translation. Our pipeline (i) assembles two PyTorch
sources -- the problem-solving set from TorchLeet (Aroori & Chien, 2025) and a
GitHub-derived set from CodeParrot (Wolf et al., 2022) -- and uses GPT-4o-mini
to produce initial JAX drafts; (ii) engages two professional developers to
iteratively repair those drafts until functional equivalence, yielding a
curated fixed-bug dataset of common errors and patches; and (iii) constructs
augmented prompts that inject structured guidance from these fixes to steer
lightweight LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o-mini). We also introduce three metrics tailored
to PyTorch to JAX: T2J CodeTrans Score, T2J FixCost Score (an LLM-based
estimate of bug-fix effort), and T2J Comparison Score (LLM-as-judge).
Empirically, T2J raises GPT-4o-mini performance by up to 10% on CodeBLEU, 50%
on T2J FixCost Score, 1.33 points on T2J CodeTrans Score (0--4 scale), and 100%
on T2J Comparison Score; moreover, the generated code runs up to 2.5x faster
than the baseline.

TL;DR: 本文对Transformer中Layer Normalization的不同放置位置进行了理论分析，研究了前向（隐藏状态）和后向（梯度）稳定性，为训练动态提供了关键见解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管Transformer被广泛使用，但其训练过程可能不稳定。Layer Normalization作为标准组件能改善训练稳定性，但其放置位置往往缺乏理论指导。

Method: 通过理论分析研究不同Layer Normalization放置下的前向稳定性（隐藏状态增长界限）和后向稳定性（梯度反向传播影响），并指导残差步长的缩放选择。

Result: 理论分析揭示了不同Layer Normalization放置对训练动态的影响，数值结果验证了理论发现，适当的残差步长缩放能进一步提升稳定性和性能。

Conclusion: 该框架为检查新架构修改下Transformer的稳定性提供了原则性方法，为未来设计提供指导。

Abstract: Despite their widespread use, training deep Transformers can be unstable.
Layer normalization, a standard component, improves training stability, but its
placement has often been ad-hoc. In this paper, we conduct a principled study
on the forward (hidden states) and backward (gradient) stability of
Transformers under different layer normalization placements. Our theory
provides key insights into the training dynamics: whether training drives
Transformers toward regular solutions or pathological behaviors. For forward
stability, we derive explicit bounds on the growth of hidden states in trained
Transformers. For backward stability, we analyze how layer normalization
affects the backpropagation of gradients, thereby explaining the training
dynamics of each layer normalization placement. Our analysis also guides the
scaling of residual steps in Transformer blocks, where appropriate choices can
further improve stability and performance. Our numerical results corroborate
our theoretical findings. Beyond these results, our framework provides a
principled way to sanity-check the stability of Transformers under new
architectural modifications, offering guidance for future designs.

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in generative modeling have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in molecular generation, yet the integration of comprehensive
biomedical knowledge into these models has remained an untapped frontier. In
this study, we introduce K-DREAM (Knowledge-Driven Embedding-Augmented Model),
a novel framework that leverages knowledge graphs to augment diffusion-based
generative models for drug discovery. By embedding structured information from
large-scale knowledge graphs, K-DREAM directs molecular generation toward
candidates with higher biological relevance and therapeutic suitability. This
integration ensures that the generated molecules are aligned with specific
therapeutic targets, moving beyond traditional heuristic-driven approaches. In
targeted drug design tasks, K-DREAM generates drug candidates with improved
binding affinities and predicted efficacy, surpassing current state-of-the-art
generative models. It also demonstrates flexibility by producing molecules
designed for multiple targets, enabling applications to complex disease
mechanisms. These results highlight the utility of knowledge-enhanced
generative models in rational drug design and their relevance to practical
therapeutic development.

Abstract: Excess alcohol consumption leads to serious health risks and severe
consequences for both individuals and their communities. To advocate for
healthier drinking habits, we introduce a groundbreaking mobile smartwatch
application approach to just-in-time interventions for intoxication warnings.
In this work, we have created a dataset gathering TAC, accelerometer,

TL;DR: AutoGD是一种自动调整学习率的梯度下降方法，无需用户手动调参，能够在不知道平滑度常数的情况下恢复GD的最优收敛率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 梯度下降等优化方法的性能严重依赖学习率的选择，手动调整学习率需要大量用户调参工作，特别是在作为其他算法内循环时，期望用户调参不切实际。

Method: 引入AutoGD方法，在每次迭代时自动判断是增加还是减少学习率，并扩展到AutoBFGS和AutoLBFGS。

Result: 实验在传统问题和变分推断优化任务上展示了方法的强大性能，能够恢复GD的最优收敛率（最多相差一个常数）。

Conclusion: AutoGD为梯度下降方法提供了自动学习率调整的有效解决方案，无需平滑度常数知识即可实现良好性能。

Abstract: The performance of gradient-based optimization methods, such as standard
gradient descent (GD), greatly depends on the choice of learning rate. However,
it can require a non-trivial amount of user tuning effort to select an
appropriate learning rate schedule. When such methods appear as inner loops of
other algorithms, expecting the user to tune the learning rates may be
impractical. To address this, we introduce AutoGD: a gradient descent method
that automatically determines whether to increase or decrease the learning rate
at a given iteration. We establish the convergence of AutoGD, and show that we
can recover the optimal rate of GD (up to a constant) for a broad class of
functions without knowledge of smoothness constants. Experiments on a variety
of traditional problems and variational inference optimization tasks
demonstrate strong performance of the method, along with its extensions to
AutoBFGS and AutoLBFGS.

*Naman Agrawal*

TL;DR: 该研究探索了复值卷积神经网络在音频信号处理中的应用，重点研究如何保留和利用实值网络中常被忽略的相位信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统实值神经网络在处理音频信号时往往忽略相位信息，而复值网络能够更好地保留和利用这种重要特征，提升音频处理任务的性能。

Method: 提出复值卷积神经网络架构，包括复卷积、池化层、Wirtinger微分和各种复值激活函数，并采用复批量归一化和权重初始化方案确保训练稳定性。通过三个阶段进行实证评估：图像数据集基准测试、基于MFCC的音频分类、以及引入图神经网络建模相位信息。

Result: CVCNNs在图像数据集上表现与实值CNN相当；在音频分类中，基于实值MFCC的CVCNNs略优于实值CNN；通过GNN建模相位信息在音乐流派分类中取得了可衡量的性能提升。

Conclusion: 复值架构具有强大的表达能力，相位是音频处理中有意义且可利用的特征。虽然当前方法（特别是cardioid激活函数）显示出潜力，但未来需要开发更多相位感知设计来充分发挥复值表示在神经网络中的潜力。

Abstract: This study explores the design and application of Complex-Valued
Convolutional Neural Networks (CVCNNs) in audio signal processing, with a focus
on preserving and utilizing phase information often neglected in real-valued
networks. We begin by presenting the foundational theoretical concepts of
CVCNNs, including complex convolutions, pooling layers, Wirtinger-based
differentiation, and various complex-valued activation functions. These are
complemented by critical adaptations of training techniques, including complex
batch normalization and weight initialization schemes, to ensure stability in
training dynamics. Empirical evaluations are conducted across three stages.
First, CVCNNs are benchmarked on standard image datasets, where they
demonstrate competitive performance with real-valued CNNs, even under synthetic
complex perturbations. Although our focus is audio signal processing, we first
evaluate CVCNNs on image datasets to establish baseline performance and
validate training stability before applying them to audio tasks. In the second
experiment, we focus on audio classification using Mel-Frequency Cepstral
Coefficients (MFCCs). CVCNNs trained on real-valued MFCCs slightly outperform
real CNNs, while preserving phase in input workflows highlights challenges in
exploiting phase without architectural modifications. Finally, a third
experiment introduces GNNs to model phase information via edge weighting, where
the inclusion of phase yields measurable gains in both binary and multi-class
genre classification. These results underscore the expressive capacity of
complex-valued architectures and confirm phase as a meaningful and exploitable
feature in audio processing applications. While current methods show promise,
especially with activations like cardioid, future advances in phase-aware
design will be essential to leverage the potential of complex representations
in neural networks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MemPromptTSS是一个用于多粒度时间序列分割的框架，通过引入持久提示记忆来解决现有方法中提示影响快速衰减的问题，实现了跨整个序列的持续指导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时间序列分割的提示方法仅在局部上下文中操作，提示的影响会快速消失，无法在整个序列中指导预测。需要一种能够使提示影响持久化的方法。

Method: 提出MemPromptTSS框架，使用记忆编码器将提示及其周围子序列转换为存储在记忆库中的记忆令牌，使每个新预测不仅基于局部线索，还能基于所有迭代中积累的提示。

Result: 在6个数据集上的实验显示，MemPromptTSS在单次迭代推理中比最佳基线在单粒度和多粒度分割上分别提升23%和85%的准确率，在迭代推理中平均每次迭代增益为2.66个百分点，优于PromptTSS的1.19。

Conclusion: 持久记忆对于提示引导的分割至关重要，MemPromptTSS为实际应用提供了一个实用有效的框架。

Abstract: Web platforms, mobile applications, and connected sensing systems generate
multivariate time series with states at multiple levels of granularity, from
coarse regimes to fine-grained events. Effective segmentation in these settings
requires integrating across granularities while supporting iterative refinement
through sparse prompt signals, which provide a compact mechanism for injecting
domain knowledge. Yet existing prompting approaches for time series
segmentation operate only within local contexts, so the effect of a prompt
quickly fades and cannot guide predictions across the entire sequence. To
overcome this limitation, we propose MemPromptTSS, a framework for iterative
multi-granularity segmentation that introduces persistent prompt memory. A
memory encoder transforms prompts and their surrounding subsequences into
memory tokens stored in a bank. This persistent memory enables each new
prediction to condition not only on local cues but also on all prompts
accumulated across iterations, ensuring their influence persists across the
entire sequence. Experiments on six datasets covering wearable sensing and
industrial monitoring show that MemPromptTSS achieves 23% and 85% accuracy
improvements over the best baseline in single- and multi-granularity
segmentation under single iteration inference, and provides stronger refinement
in iterative inference with average per-iteration gains of 2.66 percentage
points compared to 1.19 for PromptTSS. These results highlight the importance
of persistent memory for prompt-guided segmentation, establishing MemPromptTSS
as a practical and effective framework for real-world applications.

TL;DR: 提出SQS-SD框架，通过结构化稀疏化和格基量化来压缩边缘SLM生成的草稿token分布，以解决边缘-云推测解码中的带宽瓶颈问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 边缘-云推测解码中，边缘-云链路的有限带宽限制了草稿token分布的有效压缩，这是加速推理的关键瓶颈。

Method: 提出SQS-SD框架，利用分布稀疏性进行结构化稀疏化和格基量化。K-SQS采用固定top-K截断，C-SQS通过在线符合预测自适应调整保留token集。

Result: 实证结果表明，两种方法在互补的操作机制下都能改善端到端延迟和拒绝率。

Conclusion: 信息论分析指导下的SQS-SD框架有效解决了边缘-云推测解码中的带宽限制问题，通过稀疏化和量化技术提升了推理效率。

Abstract: Edge-cloud speculative decoding (SD) accelerates inference by having a
cloud-based large language model (LLM) that verifies draft tokens generated by
a resource-constrained small language model (SLM) at the edge. A central
bottleneck is the limited bandwidth of the edge-cloud link, which necessitates
efficient compression of draft token distributions. We first derive an
information-theoretic bound that decomposes the token rejection rate into
contributions from SLM-LLM distribution mismatch and from quantization
distortion. Guided by this analysis, we propose the Sparse Quantize-and-Sample
SD (SQS-SD) framework, which exploits distributional sparsity through
structured sparsification and lattice-based quantization. Within this
framework, K-SQS applies fixed top-K truncation, while C-SQS adaptively adjusts
the retained token set via online conformal prediction to ensure bounded
deviation from the dense distribution. Empirical results confirm that both
approaches improve end-to-end latency and rejection rates in complimentary
operating regimes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统不完全多视图谱聚类需要在特征提取后使用K-means算法生成聚类结果，且未能有效利用样本连通性信息。

Method: 对提取特征施加非负约束直接获得聚类结果，基于谱聚类结果构建连通性矩阵，并最小化基于连通性矩阵的自表示残差。使用乘法更新迭代算法求解优化问题。

Result: 在基准数据集上，CRG_IMSC优于现有最先进的聚类方法，实验验证了算法的收敛性。

Conclusion: CRG_IMSC通过直接获得聚类结果和有效利用样本连通性，提升了不完全多视图聚类的性能。

Abstract: Incomplete multi-view spectral clustering generalizes spectral clustering to
multi-view data and simultaneously realizes the partition of multi-view data
with missing views. For this category of method, K-means algorithm needs to be
performed to generate the clustering result after the procedure of feature
extraction. More importantly, the connectivity of samples reflected by the
clustering result is not utilized effectively. To overcome these defects, we
propose Clustering Result re-Guided Incomplete Multi-view Spectral Clustering
(CRG_IMSC). CRG_IMSC obtains the clustering result directly by imposing
nonnegative constraint to the extracted feature. Furthermore, it constructs the
connectivity matrix according to the result of spectral clustering, and
minimizes the residual of self-representation based on the connectivity matrix.
A novel iterative algorithm using multiplicative update is developed to solve
the optimization problem of CRG_IMSC, and its convergence is proved rigorously.
On benchmark datasets, for multi-view data, CRG_IMSC performs better than
state-of-the-art clustering methods, and the experimental results also
demonstrate the convergence of CRG_IMSC algorithm.

Abstract: State aggregation aims to reduce the computational complexity of solving
Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) while preserving the performance of the
original system. A fundamental challenge lies in optimizing policies within the
aggregated, or abstract, space such that the performance remains optimal in the
ground MDP-a property referred to as {"}optimal policy equivalence {"}.
  This paper presents an abstraction framework based on the notion of
homomorphism, in which two Markov chains are deemed homomorphic if their value
functions exhibit a linear relationship. Within this theoretical framework, we
establish a sufficient condition for the equivalence of optimal policy.
  We further examine scenarios where the sufficient condition is not met and
derive an upper bound on the approximation error and a performance lower bound
for the objective function under the ground MDP. We propose Homomorphic Policy
Gradient (HPG), which guarantees optimal policy equivalence under sufficient
conditions, and its extension, Error-Bounded HPG (EBHPG), which balances
computational efficiency and the performance loss induced by aggregation. In
the experiments, we validated the theoretical results and conducted comparative
evaluations against seven algorithms.

Conclusion: FPO成功实现了条件流匹配模型在在线强化学习中的稳定微调，消融研究验证了各计算模块的有效性。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models such as OpenVLA, Octo, and $\pi_0$ have
shown strong generalization by leveraging large-scale demonstrations, yet their
performance is still fundamentally constrained by the quality and coverage of
supervised data. Reinforcement learning (RL) provides a promising path for
improving and fine-tuning VLAs through online interaction. However,
conventional policy gradient methods are computationally infeasible in the
context of flow-matching based models due to the intractability of the
importance sampling process, which requires explicit computation of policy
ratios. To overcome this limitation, we propose Flow Policy Optimization (FPO)
algorithm, which reformulates importance sampling by leveraging per-sample
changes in the conditional flow-matching objective. Furthermore, FPO achieves
stable and scalable online reinforcement fine-tuning of the $\pi_0$ model by
integrating structure-aware credit assignment to enhance gradient efficiency,
clipped surrogate objectives to stabilize optimization, multi-step latent
exploration to encourage diverse policy updates, and a Q-ensemble mechanism to
provide robust value estimation. We evaluate FPO on the LIBERO benchmark and
the ALOHA simulation task against supervised, preference-aligned,
diffusion-based, autoregressive online RL, and $\pi_0$-FAST baselines,
observing consistent improvements over the imitation prior and strong
alternatives with stable learning under sparse rewards. In addition, ablation
studies and analyses of the latent space dynamics further highlight the
contributions of individual components within FPO, validating the effectiveness
of the proposed computational modules and the stable convergence of the
conditional flow-matching objective during online RL.

Abstract: Online sensing plays an important role in advancing modern manufacturing. The
real-time sensor signals, which can be stored as high-resolution time series
data, contain rich information about the operation status. One of its popular
usages is online process monitoring, which can be achieved by effective anomaly
detection from the sensor signals. However, most existing approaches either
heavily rely on labeled data for training supervised models, or are designed to
detect only extreme outliers, thus are ineffective at identifying subtle
semantic off-track anomalies to capture where new regimes or unexpected
routines start. To address this challenge, we propose an matrix profile-based
unsupervised anomaly detection algorithm that captures fabrication cycle
similarity and performs semantic segmentation to precisely identify the onset
of defect anomalies in additive manufacturing. The effectiveness of the
proposed method is demonstrated by the experiments on real-world sensor data.

Conclusion: 通过联合建模函数调用图和进程调用图，能够获得更全面的软件系统表示，为多视角软件分析提供了有效方法。

Abstract: Software systems can be represented as graphs, capturing dependencies among
functions and processes. An interesting aspect of software systems is that they
can be represented as different types of graphs, depending on the extraction
goals and priorities. For example, function calls within the software can be
captured to create function call graphs, which highlight the relationships
between functions and their dependencies. Alternatively, the processes spawned
by the software can be modeled to generate process interaction graphs, which
focus on runtime behavior and inter-process communication. While these graph
representations are related, each captures a distinct perspective of the
system, providing complementary insights into its structure and operation.
While previous studies have leveraged graph neural networks (GNNs) to analyze
software behaviors, most of this work has focused on a single type of graph
representation. The joint modeling of both function call graphs and process
interaction graphs remains largely underexplored, leaving opportunities for
deeper, multi-perspective analysis of software systems. This paper presents a
pipeline for constructing and training Function Call Graphs (FCGs) and Process
Call Graphs (PCGs) and learning joint embeddings. We demonstrate that joint
embeddings outperform a single-graph model. In this paper, we propose
GeminiNet, a unified neural network approach that learns joint embeddings from
both FCGs and PCGs. We construct a new dataset of 635 Windows executables (318
malicious and 317 benign), extracting FCGs via Ghidra and PCGs via Any.Run
sandbox. GeminiNet employs dual graph convolutional branches with an adaptive
gating mechanism that balances contributions from static and dynamic views.

Result: 实验表明该方法在保持竞争性鲁棒精度的同时，提供了比现有方法更紧的认证边界。

Conclusion: 提出的WDA方法在灵活性和认证紧密度方面优于现有方法，为WDRO问题提供了精确可处理的表征。

Abstract: Wasserstein distributionally robust optimization (WDRO) provides a framework
for adversarial robustness, yet existing methods based on global Lipschitz
continuity or strong duality often yield loose upper bounds or require
prohibitive computation. In this work, we address these limitations by
introducing a primal approach and adopting a notion of exact Lipschitz
certificate to tighten this upper bound of WDRO. In addition, we propose a
novel Wasserstein distributional attack (WDA) that directly constructs a
candidate for the worst-case distribution. Compared to existing point-wise
attack and its variants, our WDA offers greater flexibility in the number and
location of attack points. In particular, by leveraging the piecewise-affine
structure of ReLU networks on their activation cells, our approach results in
an exact tractable characterization of the corresponding WDRO problem.
Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our method achieves competitive robust
accuracy against state-of-the-art baselines while offering tighter certificates
than existing methods. Our code is available at

neural patterns, 3) BiTCN with learnable fusion capturing forward/backward
neural dynamics. Demonstrating enhanced robustness, BITE achieves
state-of-the-art performance across four divergent paradigms (BCICIV-2A/2B,
HGD, SD-SSVEP), excelling in both within-subject accuracy and cross-subject
generalization. As a unified architecture, it combines robust performance

*Yinghui He,Abhishek Panigrahi,Yong Lin,Sanjeev Arora*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: STAT是一种新的微调策略，利用更强LLM的元认知能力作为教师，通过识别学生模型的缺失技能并针对性训练，显著提升数学推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统监督微调在类似训练数据上往往出现性能饱和，需要更有效的训练策略来突破这一瓶颈。

Method: 教师模型创建任务所需技能列表并标记数据点，通过监控学生回答建立缺失技能档案，然后采用STAT-Sel（重加权现有训练样本）或STAT-Syn（合成缺失技能示例）构建修改的训练集。

Result: 在Llama和Qwen模型上，STAT在MATH数据集上提升达7.5%，在分布外基准上平均提升4.6%，且与GRPO强化学习方法互补。

Conclusion: 技能导向的自适应训练应广泛改进当前训练流程，有效解决模型技能缺失问题。

Abstract: Language models often show little to no improvement (i.e., "saturation") when
trained via vanilla supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on data similar to what they
saw in their training set (e.g., MATH). We introduce a new fine-tuning
strategy, STAT, to train such a student model by using the metacognition
ability of a stronger large language model (LLM) as the teacher. The teacher
uses the task dataset to create a list of skills needed for the task, and then
labels each data point with its required skills (Didolkar et al., 2024). By
monitoring the student's answers, the teacher creates a Missing-Skill-Profile
for the student, tracking how often they failed to apply each skill in their
responses. We use this idea to build a modified training set in one of two
ways. In STAT-Sel, the teacher uses an existing set of training examples but
adaptively reweights them according to the Missing-Skill-Profile. In STAT-Syn,
the teacher synthesizes additional examples involving missing skills. Across
extensive experiments on Llama and Qwen models, our methods yield improvements
of up to 7.5% on MATH, whereas SFT provides only limited gains. Furthermore,
STAT enhances performance on out-of-distribution benchmarks (e.g., AIME24/25,
AMC23, etc.) by an average of 4.6%. Crucially, we find that STAT is
complementary to RL via GRPO (Shao et al., 2024): after the model is improved
using STAT to address skill gaps, GRPO continues to add further gains. We
conclude that skill-targeted adaptive training should broadly improve current
training pipelines. Our code is available at:

Motivation: 低空经济网络中无人机配备视觉语言模型进行实时多模态推理时，面临推理精度和通信效率的平衡挑战，需要解决有限机载资源和动态网络条件带来的问题。

Method: 提出分层优化框架：ARPO算法用于精度约束下的资源分配，LLaRA方法使用LLM离线优化强化学习的奖励设计，实现自适应无人机轨迹优化。

Result: 数值结果表明该框架在动态低空经济网络条件下能有效提升推理性能和通信效率。

Conclusion: 所提出的分层优化框架成功解决了无人机视觉问答任务中的延迟和功耗优化问题，证明了LLM增强强化学习在无人机轨迹优化中的有效性。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Low-Altitude Economy Networks (LAENets) has enabled
a variety of applications, including aerial surveillance, environmental
sensing, and semantic data collection. To support these scenarios, unmanned
aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with onboard vision-language models (VLMs)
offer a promising solution for real-time multimodal inference. However,
ensuring both inference accuracy and communication efficiency remains a
significant challenge due to limited onboard resources and dynamic network
conditions. In this paper, we first propose a UAV-enabled LAENet system model
that jointly captures UAV mobility, user-UAV communication, and the onboard
visual question answering (VQA) pipeline. Based on this model, we formulate a
mixed-integer non-convex optimization problem to minimize task latency and
power consumption under user-specific accuracy constraints. To solve the
problem, we design a hierarchical optimization framework composed of two parts:
(i) an Alternating Resolution and Power Optimization (ARPO) algorithm for
resource allocation under accuracy constraints, and (ii) a Large Language
Model-augmented Reinforcement Learning Approach (LLaRA) for adaptive UAV
trajectory optimization. The large language model (LLM) serves as an expert in
refining reward design of reinforcement learning in an offline fashion,
introducing no additional latency in real-time decision-making. Numerical
results demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed framework in improving
inference performance and communication efficiency under dynamic LAENet
conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习需要大量环境交互样本，但在复杂环境中计算成本高昂。PPOPT旨在通过预训练减少所需样本量。

Method: 采用包含预训练神经网络中间层的新型策略网络架构，在具有相似物理特性的不同环境上进行预训练。

Result: PPOPT在小训练样本上优于经典PPO，在奖励获取和训练稳定性方面表现更好。虽然不如DYNA DDPG等基于模型的方法，但训练时间显著更短。

Conclusion: PPOPT通过预训练有效提升了模型无关强化学习在物理环境中的训练效率和稳定性，并提供了开源实现。

Abstract: We introduce PPOPT - Proximal Policy Optimization using Pretraining, a novel,
model-free deep-reinforcement-learning algorithm that leverages pretraining to
achieve high training efficiency and stability on very small training samples
in physics-based environments. Reinforcement learning agents typically rely on
large samples of environment interactions to learn a policy. However, frequent
interactions with a (computer-simulated) environment may incur high
computational costs, especially when the environment is complex. Our main
innovation is a new policy neural network architecture that consists of a
pretrained neural network middle section sandwiched between two fully-connected
networks. Pretraining part of the network on a different environment with
similar physics will help the agent learn the target environment with high
efficiency because it will leverage a general understanding of the
transferrable physics characteristics from the pretraining environment. We
demonstrate that PPOPT outperforms baseline classic PPO on small training
samples both in terms of rewards gained and general training stability. While
PPOPT underperforms against classic model-based methods such as DYNA DDPG, the
model-free nature of PPOPT allows it to train in significantly less time than
its model-based counterparts. Finally, we present our implementation of PPOPT
as open-source software, available at github.com/Davidrxyang/PPOPT.

Motivation: 解决小样本不平衡生物医学数据集中深度学习模型优化不稳定和泛化能力差的问题。

Method: 使用软最大不确定性作为连续难度度量，构建四阶段课程学习（简单-非常困难），将FOSSIL集成到卷积和基于transformer的架构中，用于Mpox皮肤病变诊断。

Result: 在所有设置中，FOSSIL显著提高了区分度（AUC = 0.9573）、校准性（ECE = 0.053）以及在真实世界扰动下的鲁棒性，优于传统基线方法。

Conclusion: FOSSIL是一个可泛化、数据高效且可解释的框架，适用于医学影像中数据稀缺情况下的难度感知学习。

Abstract: Deep learning in small and imbalanced biomedical datasets remains
fundamentally constrained by unstable optimization and poor generalization. We
present the first biomedical implementation of FOSSIL (Flexible Optimization
via Sample-Sensitive Importance Learning), a regret-minimizing weighting
framework that adaptively balances training emphasis according to sample
difficulty. Using softmax-based uncertainty as a continuous measure of
difficulty, we construct a four-stage curriculum (Easy-Very Hard) and integrate
FOSSIL into both convolutional and transformer-based architectures for Mpox
skin lesion diagnosis. Across all settings, FOSSIL substantially improves
discrimination (AUC = 0.9573), calibration (ECE = 0.053), and robustness under
real-world perturbations, outperforming conventional baselines without
metadata, manual curation, or synthetic augmentation. The results position
FOSSIL as a generalizable, data-efficient, and interpretable framework for
difficulty-aware learning in medical imaging under data scarcity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有学习方法忽视实际稳定性约束，且在跨不同箱子尺寸时泛化能力有限。

Method: 使用加权奖励函数结合装载率和高度差指标，采用裁剪策略梯度优化和定制策略漂移方法避免策略熵崩溃。

Result: O4M-SP在不同箱子尺寸上成功泛化，显著优于基线方法，并能有效处理稳定性约束场景。

Conclusion: O4M-SP框架在三维装箱问题上表现出色，具有强实用性和泛化能力。

Abstract: The three-dimensional bin packing problem (3D-BPP) is widely applied in
logistics and warehousing. Existing learning-based approaches often neglect
practical stability-related constraints and exhibit limitations in generalizing
across diverse bin dimensions. To address these limitations, we propose a novel
deep reinforcement learning framework, One4Many-StablePacker (O4M-SP). The
primary advantage of O4M-SP is its ability to handle various bin dimensions in
a single training process while incorporating support and weight constraints
common in practice. Our training method introduces two innovative mechanisms.
First, it employs a weighted reward function that integrates loading rate and a
new height difference metric for packing layouts, promoting improved bin
utilization through flatter packing configurations. Second, it combines clipped
policy gradient optimization with a tailored policy drifting method to mitigate
policy entropy collapse, encouraging exploration at critical decision nodes
during packing to avoid suboptimal solutions. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that O4M-SP generalizes successfully across diverse bin dimensions and
significantly outperforms baseline methods. Furthermore, O4M-SP exhibits strong
practical applicability by effectively addressing packing scenarios with
stability constraints.

<details>

Motivation: 自注意力能自适应识别相关元素但依赖绝对位置嵌入，卷积能相对编码但固定核大小限制了自适应选择能力，需要统一两者的优势。

Method: 提出Translution操作，结合自注意力的自适应识别能力和卷积的相对编码优势，并开发轻量级变体α-Translution以解决参数过多问题。

Result: 在计算机视觉和自然语言处理任务上的实验表明，Translution（包括α-Translution）相比自注意力实现了更高的准确率。

Conclusion: Translution成功统一了自注意力和卷积的优势，在保持性能的同时提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: When modeling a given type of data, we consider it to involve two key
aspects: 1) identifying relevant elements (e.g., image pixels or textual words)
to a central element, as in a convolutional receptive field, or to a query
element, as in self-attention, and 2) encoding these tokens effectively.
Self-attention can adaptively identify these elements but relies on absolute
positional embedding for structural representation learning. In contrast,
convolution encodes elements in a relative manner, yet their fixed kernel size
limits their ability to adaptively select the relevant elements. In this paper,
we introduce Translution, an operation that unifies the adaptive identification
capability of self-attention and the relative encoding advantage of
convolution. However, this integration leads to a substantial increase in the
number of parameters, exceeding most currently available computational
resources. Therefore, we propose a lightweight variant of Translution, named
{\alpha}-Translution. Experiments on computer vision and natural language
processing tasks show that Translution (including {\alpha}-Translution)
achieves superior accuracy compared to self-attention. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的持续预训练方法存在灾难性遗忘和领域容量有限的问题，现有层扩展策略的均匀扩展和更新仍然会纠缠通用和领域学习，降低效果。

Method: 提出两阶段框架：1) 通用能力引导的选择性层扩展，复制对通用领域最不关键的层；2) 自适应单元解耦调优，根据通用领域重要性解耦参数单元并分配非对称学习率。

Result: 在数学和医学基准测试中，ADEPT仅使用15%参数和不到50%训练时间，在通用领域和目标领域分别比全参数CPT提升5.76%和5.58%。

Conclusion: 定向扩展和解耦优化对于高效稳健的领域自适应持续预训练是必要的，为该方法提供了新原则。

Abstract: Conventional continual pretraining (CPT) for large language model (LLM)
domain adaptation often suffers from catastrophic forgetting and limited domain
capacity. Existing strategies adopt layer expansion, introducing additional
trainable parameters to accommodate new knowledge. However, the uniform
expansion and updates still entangle general and domain learning, undermining
its effectiveness. Our pilot studies reveal that LLMs exhibit functional
specialization, where layers and units differentially encode general-critical
capabilities, suggesting that parameter expansion and optimization should be
function-aware. We then propose ADEPT, Adaptive Expansion and Dynamic Decoupled
Tuning for continual pretraining, a two-stage framework for domain-adaptive
CPT. ADEPT first performs General-Competence Guided Selective Layer Expansion,
duplicating layers least critical for the general domain to increase
representational capacity while minimizing interference with general knowledge.
It then applies Adaptive Unit-Wise Decoupled Tuning, disentangling parameter
units within expanded layers according to their general-domain importance and
assigning asymmetric learning rates to balance knowledge injection and
retention. Experiments on mathematical and medical benchmarks show that ADEPT
outperforms full-parameter CPT by up to 5.76% on the general domain and 5.58%
on the target domain with only 15% of parameters tuned and less than 50%
training time. Ablation studies, theoretical analysis, and extended
investigations further demonstrate the necessity of targeted expansion and
decoupled optimization, providing new principles for efficient and robust
domain-adaptive CPT. Our code is open-sourced at

Motivation: 深度学习模型在时间序列分类中表现出色，但存在依赖训练数据中虚假相关性的问题，可能导致泛化能力下降。目前对时间序列模型内部偏差行为的研究不足，大多数现有工作依赖外部属性而非关注内部偏差。

Result: 在UCR时间序列数据集上测试了所提出的方法。

Conclusion: 该研究首次建立了深度学习时间序列分类中的点基捷径学习行为，并提供了有效的检测方法。

Abstract: Deep learning models have attracted lots of research attention in time series
classification (TSC) task in the past two decades. Recently, deep neural
networks (DNN) have surpassed classical distance-based methods and achieved
state-of-the-art performance. Despite their promising performance, deep neural
networks (DNNs) have been shown to rely on spurious correlations present in the
training data, which can hinder generalization. For instance, a model might
incorrectly associate the presence of grass with the label ``cat" if the
training set have majority of cats lying in grassy backgrounds. However, the
shortcut behavior of DNNs in time series remain under-explored. Most existing
shortcut work are relying on external attributes such as gender, patients
group, instead of focus on the internal bias behavior in time series models.
  In this paper, we take the first step to investigate and establish
point-based shortcut learning behavior in deep learning time series
classification. We further propose a simple detection method based on other
class to detect shortcut occurs without relying on test data or clean training
classes. We test our proposed method in UCR time series datasets.

Motivation: 解决LLM是否真正理解人类驾驶逻辑的问题，将LLM转化为可解释的规划器，使其行为与人类驾驶逻辑对齐。

Method: 基于人类推理模式和交通规则构建结构化驾驶指令，开发Align2ActChain模块进行逐步推理，使用LoRA在nuPlan数据集上微调LLaMA-2-7B模型。

Result: 在nuPlan Test14-random测试中，开环得分85.17，闭环非反应式得分70.31，闭环反应式得分66.96，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 结构化推理显著提升了LLM规划器的性能，在真实世界闭环基准测试中展示了更好的规划质量和人类相似性。

Abstract: Motion planning in complex scenarios is a core challenge in autonomous
driving. Conventional methods apply predefined rules or learn from driving data
to generate trajectories, while recent approaches leverage large language
models (LLMs) for decision-making. However, it remains unclear whether LLMs
truly capture human driving logic. We propose Align2Act, a motion planning
framework that transforms instruction-tuned LLMs into interpretable planners
aligned with human behavior. We derive structured driving instructions based on
human reasoning patterns (e.g., anticipate hazards, yield at intersections) and
traffic rules (e.g., stop at red lights, maintain lane boundaries). Our
Align2ActChain module guides step-by-step reasoning to produce both an
interpretable rationale and a safe trajectory. By fine-tuning LLaMA-2-7B with
LoRA on one million scenarios from the nuPlan dataset, our method achieves an
open-loop score of 85.17 and closed-loop scores of 70.31 (non-reactive) and
66.96 (reactive) on Test14-random. Unlike prior work focused on synthetic or
open-loop settings, we demonstrate improved planning quality and human-likeness
on the real-world nuPlan closed-loop benchmark. Ablation studies confirm that
structured reasoning significantly improves performance over baseline LLM
planners.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 循环注意力机制在复杂推理任务中表现优于标准注意力机制，但其理论优势尚未得到充分探索，需要从损失景观几何角度解释这一现象。

Method: 通过扩展River-Valley景观模型，区分U形谷（平坦）和V形谷（陡峭），基于经验观察推测循环注意力的递归架构诱导了River-V-Valley景观偏好，并提出SHIFT分阶段训练框架。

Result: 理论推导表明基于这种归纳偏置，循环注意力在河流方向上具有更好的损失收敛性，并鼓励学习复杂模式，SHIFT框架能加速训练同时保持可比性能。

Conclusion: 循环注意力机制通过诱导V形谷景观在复杂推理任务中具有优势，提出的SHIFT框架能有效加速训练过程。

Abstract: While looped transformers (termed as Looped-Attn) often outperform standard
transformers (termed as Single-Attn) on complex reasoning tasks, the
theoretical basis for this advantage remains underexplored. In this paper, we
explain this phenomenon through the lens of loss landscape geometry, inspired
by empirical observations of their distinct dynamics at both sample and Hessian
levels. To formalize this, we extend the River-Valley landscape model by
distinguishing between U-shaped valleys (flat) and V-shaped valleys (steep).
Based on empirical observations, we conjecture that the recursive architecture
of Looped-Attn induces a landscape-level inductive bias towards River-V-Valley.
Theoretical derivations based on this inductive bias guarantee a better loss
convergence along the river due to valley hopping, and further encourage
learning about complex patterns compared to the River-U-Valley induced by
Single-Attn. Building on this insight, we propose SHIFT (Staged HIerarchical
Framework for Progressive Training), a staged training framework that
accelerates the training process of Looped-Attn while achieving comparable
performances.

Motivation: 虽然表达能力更强的GNNs可以区分更多类型的图，但实践中观察到它们往往具有更高的泛化误差。作者希望从理论上解释这种表达能力与泛化能力之间的权衡关系。

Method: 通过WL着色算法建立图神经网络表达力与泛化能力之间的联系，分析着色诱导的等价类数量如何约束GNNs的Rademacher复杂度。

Result: 证明了表达能力越强，Rademacher复杂度越高，泛化保证越弱；同时证明了Rademacher复杂度在不同样本的着色计数扰动下具有稳定性。

Conclusion: 该框架统一了GNNs表达力与泛化能力的研究，为理解增加表达能力往往以牺牲泛化为代价提供了理论依据，且该框架适用于任意GNN架构和表达能力度量。

Abstract: The expressive power of graph neural networks (GNNs) is typically understood
through their correspondence with graph isomorphism tests such as the
Weisfeiler-Leman (WL) hierarchy. While more expressive GNNs can distinguish a
richer set of graphs, they are also observed to suffer from higher
generalization error. This work provides a theoretical explanation for this
trade-off by linking expressivity and generalization through the lens of
coloring algorithms. Specifically, we show that the number of equivalence
classes induced by WL colorings directly bounds the GNNs Rademacher complexity
-- a key data-dependent measure of generalization. Our analysis reveals that
greater expressivity leads to higher complexity and thus weaker generalization
guarantees. Furthermore, we prove that the Rademacher complexity is stable
under perturbations in the color counts across different samples, ensuring
robustness to sampling variability across datasets. Importantly, our framework
is not restricted to message-passing GNNs or 1-WL, but extends to arbitrary GNN
architectures and expressivity measures that partition graphs into equivalence
classes. These results unify the study of expressivity and generalization in
GNNs, providing a principled understanding of why increasing expressive power
often comes at the cost of generalization.

TL;DR: PANTHER是一个混合生成-判别框架，将生成式预训练扩展到用户行为建模，通过结构化标记化、序列模式识别和统一用户画像嵌入，在微信支付中实现了25.6%的下次交易预测提升和38.6%的欺诈检测召回率提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型虽然能封装广泛的世界知识，但在建模用户交互历史中的行为知识方面存在局限。用户行为构成一个独特模态，其高基数序列建模具有挑战性，判别模型在有限监督下往往表现不佳。

Method: 1) 结构化标记化将多维交易属性压缩为可解释词汇表；2) 序列模式识别模块建模周期性交易模式；3) 统一用户画像嵌入融合静态人口统计信息和动态交易历史；4) 通过离线缓存预训练嵌入实现实时可扩展性。

Result: 在微信支付中完全部署运行，PANTHER在下次交易预测HitRate@1上提升25.6%，在欺诈检测召回率上相对提升38.6%。在公共基准上的跨领域评估显示强泛化能力，相比transformer基线实现高达21%的HitRate@1增益。

Conclusion: PANTHER被确立为一个可扩展、高性能的工业级序列用户行为建模框架，成功将生成式预训练范式应用于用户行为建模领域。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown that generative pretraining can
distill vast world knowledge into compact token representations. While LLMs
encapsulate extensive world knowledge, they remain limited in modeling the
behavioral knowledge contained within user interaction histories. User behavior
forms a distinct modality, where each action, defined by multi-dimensional
attributes such as time, context, and transaction type, constitutes a
behavioral token. Modeling these high-cardinality sequences is challenging, and
discriminative models often falter under limited supervision. To bridge this
gap, we extend generative pretraining to user behavior, learning transferable
representations from unlabeled behavioral data analogous to how LLMs learn from
text. We present PANTHER, a hybrid generative-discriminative framework that
unifies user behavior pretraining and downstream adaptation, enabling
large-scale sequential user representation learning and real-time inference.
PANTHER introduces: (1) Structured Tokenization to compress multi-dimensional
transaction attributes into an interpretable vocabulary; (2) Sequence Pattern
Recognition Module (SPRM) for modeling periodic transaction motifs; (3) a
Unified User-Profile Embedding that fuses static demographics with dynamic
transaction histories; and (4) Real-time scalability enabled by offline caching
of pretrained embeddings for millisecond-level inference. Fully deployed and
operational online at WeChat Pay, PANTHER delivers a 25.6 percent boost in
next-transaction prediction HitRate@1 and a 38.6 percent relative improvement
in fraud detection recall over baselines. Cross-domain evaluations on public
benchmarks show strong generalization, achieving up to 21 percent HitRate@1
gains over transformer baselines, establishing PANTHER as a scalable,
high-performance framework for industrial sequential user behavior modeling.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles have shown promising potential to be a groundbreaking
technology for improving the safety of road users. For these vehicles, as well
as many other safety-critical robotic technologies, to be deployed in
real-world applications, we require algorithms that can generalize well to
unseen scenarios and data. Model-based reinforcement learning algorithms (MBRL)
have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance and data efficiency across a
diverse set of domains. However, these algorithms have also shown
susceptibility to changes in the environment and its transition dynamics.
  In this work, we explore the performance and generalization capabilities of
MBRL algorithms for autonomous driving, specifically in the simulated
autonomous racing environment, Roboracer (formerly F1Tenth). We frame the
head-to-head racing task as a learning problem using contextual Markov decision
processes and parameterize the driving behavior of the adversaries using the
context of the episode, thereby also parameterizing the transition and reward
dynamics. We benchmark the behavior of MBRL algorithms in this environment and
propose a novel context-aware extension of the existing literature, cMask. We
demonstrate that context-aware MBRL algorithms generalize better to
out-of-distribution adversary behaviors relative to context-free approaches. We
also demonstrate that cMask displays strong generalization capabilities, as
well as further performance improvement relative to other context-aware MBRL

*Yanping Zheng,Zhewei Wei,Frank de Hoog,Xu Chen,Hongteng Xu,Yuhang Ye,Jiadeng Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Lighter-X是一个高效的图神经网络推荐系统框架，通过压缩稀疏邻接结构和高维嵌入矩阵，将参数复杂度从O(n×d)降低到O(h×d)，同时保持模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于图的推荐系统（如LightGCN）需要为每个节点维护d维嵌入，参数复杂度为O(n×d)，这在现实应用的大规模图上部署面临显著挑战。

Method: 分析原始参数结构和固有冗余，提出稀疏邻接结构和高维嵌入矩阵的高效压缩方案，采用解耦框架优化训练过程。

Result: 在大规模交互图上，仅使用LightGCN 1%的参数就能达到相当甚至更好的性能。

Conclusion: Lighter-X显著减少了参数规模和计算复杂度，同时保持了基础模型的理论保证和实证性能，实现了大规模实际部署。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in
recommendation systems. However, conventional graph-based recommenders, such as
LightGCN, require maintaining embeddings of size $d$ for each node, resulting
in a parameter complexity of $\mathcal{O}(n \times d)$, where $n$ represents
the total number of users and items. This scaling pattern poses significant
challenges for deployment on large-scale graphs encountered in real-world
applications. To address this scalability limitation, we propose
\textbf{Lighter-X}, an efficient and modular framework that can be seamlessly
integrated with existing GNN-based recommender architectures. Our approach
substantially reduces both parameter size and computational complexity while
preserving the theoretical guarantees and empirical performance of the base
models, thereby enabling practical deployment at scale. Specifically, we
analyze the original structure and inherent redundancy in their parameters,
identifying opportunities for optimization. Based on this insight, we propose
an efficient compression scheme for the sparse adjacency structure and
high-dimensional embedding matrices, achieving a parameter complexity of
$\mathcal{O}(h \times d)$, where $h \ll n$. Furthermore, the model is optimized
through a decoupled framework, reducing computational complexity during the
training process and enhancing scalability. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that Lighter-X achieves comparable performance to baseline models with
significantly fewer parameters. In particular, on large-scale interaction
graphs with millions of edges, we are able to attain even better results with
only 1\% of the parameter over LightGCN.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个偏好驱动的知识蒸馏框架，结合LLMs和GNNs的优势进行少样本节点分类，通过GNN偏好驱动节点选择器和节点偏好驱动GNN选择器实现高效知识蒸馏。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNNs处理文本属性图依赖人工标注标签且难以处理复杂局部拓扑，LLMs在少样本学习表现好但存在可扩展性问题，需要结合两者优势。

Method: 开发GNN偏好驱动节点选择器促进LLMs到教师GNN的预测蒸馏，开发节点偏好驱动GNN选择器为每个节点选择最合适的教师GNN，实现从教师GNN到学生GNN的定制化知识蒸馏。

Result: 在真实世界文本属性图上进行的大量实验验证了该框架在少样本节点分类中的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的偏好驱动知识蒸馏框架成功结合了LLMs和GNNs的互补优势，在少样本节点分类任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) can efficiently process text-attributed graphs
(TAGs) due to their message-passing mechanisms, but their training heavily
relies on the human-annotated labels. Moreover, the complex and diverse local
topologies of nodes of real-world TAGs make it challenging for a single
mechanism to handle. Large language models (LLMs) perform well in
zero-/few-shot learning on TAGs but suffer from a scalability challenge.
Therefore, we propose a preference-driven knowledge distillation (PKD)
framework to synergize the complementary strengths of LLMs and various GNNs for
few-shot node classification. Specifically, we develop a GNN-preference-driven
node selector that effectively promotes prediction distillation from LLMs to
teacher GNNs. To further tackle nodes' intricate local topologies, we develop a
node-preference-driven GNN selector that identifies the most suitable teacher
GNN for each node, thereby facilitating tailored knowledge distillation from
teacher GNNs to the student GNN. Extensive experiments validate the efficacy of
our proposed framework in few-shot node classification on real-world TAGs.

### [389] [CacheClip: Accelerating RAG with Effective KV Cache Reuse](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10129)
*Bin Yang,Qiuyu Leng,Jun Zeng,Zhenhua Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CacheClip是一个新颖的KV缓存重用框架，通过小辅助LLM指导的token选择和共享前缀等技术，在RAG系统中同时实现快速首token时间和高质量生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的KV缓存重用方法在RAG场景中存在基本权衡：前缀缓存需要相同前缀但在RAG中很少出现，而直接预计算由于缺少跨块注意力和重复注意力下沉而牺牲质量。

Method: CacheClip集成三种技术：(1)辅助模型指导的token选择进行选择性KV缓存重计算，(2)共享前缀消除冗余注意力下沉，(3)分组策略在部分KV缓存更新时保持局部连贯性。

Result: 实验显示CacheClip在NIAH和LongBench上分别保持94.8%和85.0%的完整注意力性能，比APE和CacheBlend在NIAH上分别高出25.2%和35.1%。同时将LLM推理预填充时间加速达1.92倍。

Conclusion: CacheClip为RAG系统中的效率-质量权衡提供了实用解决方案，实现了快速首token时间和高质量生成的平衡。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems suffer from severe
time-to-first-token (TTFT) bottlenecks due to long input sequences. Existing KV
cache reuse methods face a fundamental trade-off: prefix caching requires
identical prefixes that rarely occur in RAG scenarios, while direct
precomputation sacrifices quality due to missing inter-chunk attention and
repeated attention sinks. Recent methods like APE and CacheBlend partially
address these issues but remain inadequate for robust RAG applications. This
paper presents CacheClip, a novel framework that achieves both fast TTFT and
high generation quality. Our key insight is that small auxiliary LLMs exhibit
similar last-layer attention distributions to primary LLMs (the target model
for generation), enabling efficient identification of tokens critical for
restoring inter-chunk attention, thereby significantly improving response
quality on cross-chunk reasoning tasks. CacheClip integrates three techniques:
(1) auxiliary-model-guided token selection for selective KV cache
recomputation, where the auxiliary model is finetuned to improve selection
accuracy, (2) shared prefixes to eliminate redundant attention sinks, and (3)
grouping strategy to maintain local coherence during partial KV cache updates.
Experiments show CacheClip retains up to 94.8% and 85.0% of full-attention
performance on NIAH and LongBench, outperforming APE and CacheBlend by 25.2%
and 35.1% on NIAH (with reomp% = 20%). Meanwhile, CacheClip accelerates LLM
inference by up to 1.92x in prefill time, providing a practical solution to the
efficiency-quality trade-off in RAG systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PermLLM提出了一种可学习的通道置换方法，通过Sinkhorn归一化将离散置换矩阵转化为可微的软置换矩阵，实现端到端优化，显著提升了N:M稀疏模型的精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的通道置换方法依赖手工设计的质量指标，往往无法准确捕捉剪枝对模型性能的真实影响，需要更智能的优化方法。

Method: 使用可学习通道置换(LCP)，通过Sinkhorn归一化实现离散置换矩阵的可微优化，并采用高效的块级通道置换策略减少可学习参数和计算复杂度。

Result: 在LLaMA系列、Qwen和OPT模型上的大量实验表明，PermLLM在优化N:M稀疏模型方面取得了优越性能。

Conclusion: PermLLM能够自适应优化通道置换，有效缓解剪枝引起的误差，为N:M稀疏模型提供了更有效的优化方案。

Abstract: Channel permutation is a powerful technique for enhancing the accuracy of N:M
sparse models by reordering the channels of weight matrices to prioritize the
retention of important weights. However, traditional channel permutation
methods rely on handcrafted quality metrics, which often fail to accurately
capture the true impact of pruning on model performance. To address this
limitation, we propose PermLLM, a novel post-training pruning framework that
introduces learnable channel permutation (LCP) for N:M sparsity. LCP leverages
Sinkhorn normalization to transform discrete permutation matrices into
differentiable soft permutation matrices, enabling end-to-end optimization.
Additionally, PermLLM incorporates an efficient block-wise channel permutation
strategy, which significantly reduces the number of learnable parameters and
computational complexity. PermLLM seamlessly integrates with existing one-shot
pruning methods to adaptively optimize channel permutations, effectively
mitigating pruning-induced errors. Extensive experiments on the LLaMA series,
Qwen, and OPT models demonstrate that PermLLM achieves superior performance in
optimizing N:M sparse models. The code is available at

Motivation: 研究深度学习天气预报模型对对抗攻击的脆弱性，特别是上游天气预测的微小扰动如何改变下游热带气旋轨迹预测，现有方法在生成可靠引导攻击者指定轨迹的扰动上游预测方面存在挑战。

Method: 提出Cyc-Attack方法：预训练可微替代模型近似热带气旋检测器输出；使用偏斜感知损失函数和核膨胀策略解决类别不平衡问题；采用基于距离的梯度加权方案和正则化来约束扰动并消除虚假轨迹。

Result: Cyc-Attack能够生成物理一致的对抗性天气预报，可靠地引导下游热带气旋轨迹预测朝向攻击者指定的方向，同时保持生成的对抗性预报的逼真性和难以检测性。

Conclusion: Cyc-Attack成功克服了传统对抗攻击在天气预报系统中的局限性，为评估深度学习天气预报模型的安全性和鲁棒性提供了有效工具，揭示了这些系统在实际应用中的潜在安全风险。

Abstract: Deep learning based weather forecasting (DLWF) models leverage past weather
observations to generate future forecasts, supporting a wide range of
downstream tasks, including tropical cyclone (TC) trajectory prediction. In
this paper, we investigate their vulnerability to adversarial attacks, where
subtle perturbations to the upstream weather forecasts can alter the downstream
TC trajectory predictions. Although research on adversarial attacks in DLWF
models has grown recently, generating perturbed upstream forecasts that
reliably steer downstream output toward attacker-specified trajectories remains
a challenge. First, conventional TC detection systems are opaque,
non-differentiable black boxes, making standard gradient-based attacks
infeasible. Second, the extreme rarity of TC events leads to severe class
imbalance problem, making it difficult to develop efficient attack methods that
will produce the attacker's target trajectories. Furthermore, maintaining
physical consistency in adversarially generated forecasts presents another
significant challenge. To overcome these limitations, we propose Cyc-Attack, a
novel method that perturbs the upstream forecasts of DLWF models to generate
adversarial trajectories. First, we pre-train a differentiable surrogate model
to approximate the TC detector's output, enabling the construction of
gradient-based attacks. Cyc-Attack also employs skewness-aware loss function
with kernel dilation strategy to address the imbalance problem. Finally, a
distance-based gradient weighting scheme and regularization are used to
constrain the perturbations and eliminate spurious trajectories to ensure the
adversarial forecasts are realistic and not easily detectable.

Conclusion: FIRE框架通过数学抽象为不同类型时间序列提供统一表示，在保持高性能的同时显著提升了预测模型的可解释性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Current approaches for time series forecasting, whether in the time or
frequency domain, predominantly use deep learning models based on linear layers
or transformers. They often encode time series data in a black-box manner and
rely on trial-and-error optimization solely based on forecasting performance,
leading to limited interpretability and theoretical understanding. Furthermore,
the dynamics in data distribution over time and frequency domains pose a
critical challenge to accurate forecasting. We propose FIRE, a unified
frequency domain decomposition framework that provides a mathematical
abstraction for diverse types of time series, so as to achieve interpretable
and robust time series forecasting. FIRE introduces several key innovations:
(i) independent modeling of amplitude and phase components, (ii) adaptive
learning of weights of frequency basis components, (iii) a targeted loss
function, and (iv) a novel training paradigm for sparse data. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that FIRE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
models on long-term forecasting benchmarks, achieving superior predictive
performance and significantly enhancing interpretability of time series

Abstract: Conditional diffusion models have the generative controllability by
incorporating external conditions. However, their performance significantly
degrades with noisy conditions, such as corrupted labels in the image
generation or unreliable observations or states in the control policy
generation. This paper introduces a robust learning framework to address
extremely noisy conditions in conditional diffusion models. We empirically
demonstrate that existing noise-robust methods fail when the noise level is
high. To overcome this, we propose learning pseudo conditions as surrogates for
clean conditions and refining pseudo ones progressively via the technique of
temporal ensembling. Additionally, we develop a Reverse-time Diffusion
Condition (RDC) technique, which diffuses pseudo conditions to reinforce the
memorization effect and further facilitate the refinement of the pseudo
conditions. Experimentally, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance
across a range of noise levels on both class-conditional image generation and
visuomotor policy generation tasks.The code can be accessible via the project

Motivation: RLVR训练过程中存在熵崩溃风险，即策略多样性快速丧失，导致泛化能力不足。现有熵干预方法机制不明确且效果有限。

Method: 提出STEER方法，通过熵变化感知的重新加权方案，在token级别自适应稳定熵动态，缓解过度利用并促进稳健探索。

Result: 实验表明STEER显著缓解熵崩溃，稳定熵动态，在多个数学推理基准测试中取得更强的下游性能。

Conclusion: STEER通过直接控制熵动态，比现有间接方法更有效地解决了熵崩溃问题，提升了RLVR训练的效果。

Abstract: While Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) can enhance LLM
reasoning, its training process poses a critical risk: entropy collapse. This
phenomenon is a rapid loss of policy diversity, stemming from the
exploration-exploitation imbalance and leading to a lack of generalization.
Recent entropy-intervention methods aim to prevent \coloredtext{entropy
collapse}, yet their underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In this paper, we
conduct a quantitative analysis to reveal token-level entropy changes and how
existing entropy intervention methods help avoid entropy collapse. Our findings
point out a fundamental limitation of existing methods: they attempt to control
entropy dynamics indirectly. By only affecting related factors, such as the
advantage signal and generation probability, their effectiveness is inherently
limited and could potentially fail. To address this limitation, we introduce an
entropy-change-aware reweighting scheme, namely Stabilizing Token-level
Entropy-changE via Reweighting (STEER), that adaptively stabilizes entropy
dynamics through fine-grained token-level adjustments. Our approach mitigates
over-exploitation while fostering robust exploration. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that STEER significantly mitigates entropy collapse, stabilizes
entropy dynamics, and achieves stronger downstream performance across various
mathematical reasoning benchmarks \footnote{Our code is available at

Conclusion: INR-Bench为未来研究奠定了坚实基础，能够突出不同神经模型的优势和局限性，推动隐式神经表示领域的进一步发展。

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have gained success in various signal
processing tasks due to their advantages of continuity and infinite resolution.
However, the factors influencing their effectiveness and limitations remain
underexplored. To better understand these factors, we leverage insights from
Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) theory to analyze how model architectures (classic

Conclusion: CauchyNet作为一种基于柯西积分公式的神经网络，在数据驱动的预测建模中具有显著优势，特别是在资源受限和数据稀缺环境中展现出高效性和有效性。

Abstract: A novel neural network inspired by Cauchy's integral formula, is proposed for
function approximation tasks that include time series forecasting, missing data
imputation, etc. Hence, the novel neural network is named CauchyNet. By
embedding real-valued data into the complex plane, CauchyNet efficiently
captures complex temporal dependencies, surpassing traditional real-valued
models in both predictive performance and computational efficiency. Grounded in
Cauchy's integral formula and supported by the universal approximation theorem,
CauchyNet offers strong theoretical guarantees for function approximation. The
architecture incorporates complex-valued activation functions, enabling robust
learning from incomplete data while maintaining a compact parameter footprint
and reducing computational overhead. Through extensive experiments in diverse
domains, including transportation, energy consumption, and epidemiological
data, CauchyNet consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models in predictive
accuracy, often achieving a 50% lower mean absolute error with fewer
parameters. These findings highlight CauchyNet's potential as an effective and

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently emerged as
a promising framework for improving reasoning abilities in Large Language
Models (LLMs). However, policy optimized with binary verification prone to
overlook potential valuable exploration in reasoning trajectory. In view of
heavy annotation cost of golden Process Reward Models (PRMs), recent works
attempt using auxiliary signals for reward shaping of process tokens, involving
entropy and likelihood collected from logit space. In this work, we offer a
novel perspective on shaping RLVR with flow rewards derived from latent space,
and propose RLFR, where the flow fields of model latents are constructed from
either off-policy high-quality data and on-policy rejection sampling data, and
the velocity deviations of policy latents within it are quantified to serve as
a reward signal. RLFR first demonstrates that a well-established flow field can
be a sound environment for reward signal collection, highlighting the
expressive latent space is much underexplored. Moreover, RLFR is able to
compress any off-policy expert data as reference for constituting reward
signals, and we show that the efficient context dependence compressed within
the hidden states are utilized, rather than individual token-level denotation
for context comprehending. Experiments on both language and multimodal
reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the reliability of flow rewards, and
suggesting a promising paradigm for reward shaping with auxiliary signals.

Conclusion: GraphBFN通过统一训练和推理过程，有效解决了分子图生成中连续回归与离散分类之间的不一致性问题，提升了生成质量和效率。

Abstract: Molecular graph generation is essentially a classification generation
problem, aimed at predicting categories of atoms and bonds. Currently,
prevailing paradigms such as continuous diffusion models are trained to predict
continuous numerical values, treating the training process as a regression
task. However, the final generation necessitates a rounding step to convert
these predictions back into discrete classification categories, which is
intrinsically a classification operation. Given that the rounding operation is
not incorporated during training, there exists a significant discrepancy
between the model's training objective and its inference procedure. As a
consequence, an excessive emphasis on point-wise precision can lead to
overfitting and inefficient learning. This occurs because considerable efforts
are devoted to capturing intra-bin variations that are ultimately irrelevant to
the discrete nature of the task at hand. Such a flaw results in diminished
molecular diversity and constrains the model's generalization capabilities. To
address this fundamental limitation, we propose GraphBFN, a novel hierarchical
coarse-to-fine framework based on Bayesian Flow Networks that operates on the
parameters of distributions. By innovatively introducing Cumulative
Distribution Function, GraphBFN is capable of calculating the probability of
selecting the correct category, thereby unifying the training objective with
the sampling rounding operation. We demonstrate that our method achieves
superior performance and faster generation, setting new state-of-the-art
results on the QM9 and ZINC250k molecular graph generation benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 递归自修改在AutoML、神经架构搜索和自适应优化中日益重要，但现有框架无法确保此类更改的安全性。哥德尔机通过要求形式化改进证明来提供原则性保护，但在随机高维环境中此类证明无法获得

Method: SGM用统计置信度测试(e值、Hoeffding界)替代基于证明的要求，仅当在选定置信水平下认证了优越性时才允许修改。提出确认触发调和支出(CTHS)，通过确认事件而非轮次来索引支出，将错误预算集中在有希望的编辑上

Result: 在监督学习、强化学习和黑盒优化的实验中验证了SGM的作用：在CIFAR-100上认证真实增益，在ImageNet-100上拒绝虚假改进，在RL和优化基准上展示鲁棒性

Conclusion: SGM为学习系统中持续、风险感知的自修改提供了基础架构

Abstract: Recursive self-modification is increasingly central in AutoML, neural
architecture search, and adaptive optimization, yet no existing framework
ensures that such changes are made safely. Godel machines offer a principled
safeguard by requiring formal proofs of improvement before rewriting code;
however, such proofs are unattainable in stochastic, high-dimensional settings.
We introduce the Statistical Godel Machine (SGM), the first statistical safety
layer for recursive edits. SGM replaces proof-based requirements with
statistical confidence tests (e-values, Hoeffding bounds), admitting a
modification only when superiority is certified at a chosen confidence level,
while allocating a global error budget to bound cumulative risk across
rounds.We also propose Confirm-Triggered Harmonic Spending (CTHS), which
indexes spending by confirmation events rather than rounds, concentrating the
error budget on promising edits while preserving familywise
validity.Experiments across supervised learning, reinforcement learning, and
black-box optimization validate this role: SGM certifies genuine gains on
CIFAR-100, rejects spurious improvement on ImageNet-100, and demonstrates
robustness on RL and optimization benchmarks.Together, these results position
SGM as foundational infrastructure for continual, risk-aware self-modification
in learning systems.Code is available at:

*Ziyu Zhou,Keyan Hu,Ling Zhang,Zhaohui Xue,Yutian Fang,Yusha Zheng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种渐进尺度卷积网络(PSCNet)，结合ERA5-Land高时间分辨率变量，将低分辨率SMAP土壤水分产品降尺度到10公里空间分辨率和3小时时间分辨率，在青藏高原实现了无缝土壤水分监测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决土壤水分时空降尺度中因地表辅助因子不完整导致的时间尺度反演困难问题，提高土壤水分监测的时空分辨率。

Method: 设计PSCNet网络，包含多频时间融合模块(MFTF)捕捉时间动态，以及定制化的挤压激励(SE)块保留空间细节，结合ERA5-Land高时间分辨率变量进行降尺度。

Result: 在青藏高原验证中，PSCNet表现出最佳性能：卫星产品验证R值0.881，现场站点验证R指标排名前三，时间泛化验证相对误差控制在6%以内，时空动态可视化表现出色。

Conclusion: PSCNet通过有效建模土壤水分数据的复杂时空关系，为时空降尺度提供了一个有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Soil moisture (SM) plays a critical role in hydrological and meteorological
processes. High-resolution SM can be obtained by combining coarse passive
microwave data with fine-scale auxiliary variables. However, the inversion of
SM at the temporal scale is hindered by the incompleteness of surface auxiliary
factors. To address this issue, first, we introduce validated high temporal
resolution ERA5-Land variables into the downscaling process of the
low-resolution SMAP SM product. Subsequently, we design a progressive scale
convolutional network (PSCNet), at the core of which are two innovative
components: a multi-frequency temporal fusion module (MFTF) for capturing
temporal dynamics, and a bespoke squeeze-and-excitation (SE) block designed to
preserve fine-grained spatial details. Using this approach, we obtained
seamless SM products for the Tibetan Plateau (TP) from 2016 to 2018 at 10-km
spatial and 3-hour temporal resolution. The experimental results on the TP
demonstrated the following: 1) In the satellite product validation, the PSCNet
exhibited comparable accuracy and lower error, with a mean R value of 0.881,
outperforming other methods. 2) In the in-situ site validation, PSCNet
consistently ranked among the top three models for the R metric across all
sites, while also showing superior performance in overall error reduction. 3)
In the temporal generalization validation, the feasibility of using
high-temporal resolution ERA5-Land variables for downscaling was confirmed, as
all methods maintained an average relative error within 6\% for the R metric
and 2\% for the ubRMSE metric. 4) In the temporal dynamics and visualization
validation, PSCNet demonstrated excellent temporal sensitivity and vivid
spatial details. Overall, PSCNet provides a promising solution for
spatio-temporal downscaling by effectively modeling the intricate
spatio-temporal relationships in SM data.

TL;DR: MPPReasoner是一个多模态大语言模型，通过结合分子图像和SMILES字符串进行化学推理，显著提升了分子性质预测的性能和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分子性质预测方法存在可解释性差、跨任务泛化能力弱、缺乏化学推理能力等问题，需要开发既能准确预测又能提供化学见解的模型。

Method: 基于Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct构建，集成分子图像和SMILES字符串；采用两阶段训练策略：首先使用16,000个高质量推理轨迹进行监督微调，然后通过基于原则的强化学习进行优化。

Result: 在8个数据集上的实验表明，MPPReasoner在分布内和分布外任务上分别比最佳基线模型提升了7.91%和4.53%，展现出优异的跨任务泛化能力。

Conclusion: MPPReasoner不仅显著提升了分子性质预测性能，还能生成化学合理的推理路径，为化学家提供有价值的分析见解，大大增强了模型的可解释性和实用性。

Abstract: Molecular property prediction is crucial for drug discovery and materials
science, yet existing approaches suffer from limited interpretability, poor
cross-task generalization, and lack of chemical reasoning capabilities.
Traditional machine learning models struggle with task transferability, while
specialized molecular language models provide little insight into their
decision-making processes. To address these limitations, we propose
\textbf{MPPReasoner}, a multimodal large language model that incorporates
chemical reasoning for molecular property prediction. Our approach, built upon
Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, integrates molecular images with SMILES strings to
enable comprehensive molecular understanding. We develop a two-stage training
strategy: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) using 16,000 high-quality reasoning
trajectories generated through expert knowledge and multiple teacher models,
followed by Reinforcement Learning from Principle-Guided Rewards (RLPGR). RLPGR
employs verifiable, rule-based rewards that systematically evaluate chemical
principle application, molecular structure analysis, and logical consistency
through computational verification. Extensive experiments across 8 datasets
demonstrate significant performance improvements, with MPPReasoner
outperforming the best baselines by 7.91\% and 4.53\% on in-distribution and
out-of-distribution tasks respectively. MPPReasoner exhibits exceptional
cross-task generalization and generates chemically sound reasoning paths that
provide valuable insights into molecular property analysis, substantially
enhancing both interpretability and practical utility for chemists. Code is

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出基于持续学习的框架，通过按问题规模递增的顺序训练深度模型来解决车辆路径问题的泛化能力限制问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度模型通常针对单一规模的问题进行训练和评估，这严重限制了它们在不同问题规模间的泛化能力，阻碍了实际应用。

Method: 设计任务间正则化方案保留小规模问题的知识，任务内正则化方案模仿最新理想行为，并利用经验回放机制回顾已训练规模。

Result: 实验结果显示该方法在各种问题规模（包括训练中未见过的规模）上取得显著优于现有深度模型的性能。

Conclusion: 提出的持续学习框架有效提升了车辆路径问题深度模型的泛化能力，关键设计具有协同效应。

Abstract: Exploring machine learning techniques for addressing vehicle routing problems
has attracted considerable research attention. To achieve decent and efficient
solutions, existing deep models for vehicle routing problems are typically
trained and evaluated using instances of a single size. This substantially
limits their ability to generalize across different problem sizes and thus
hampers their practical applicability. To address the issue, we propose a
continual learning based framework that sequentially trains a deep model with
instances of ascending problem sizes. Specifically, on the one hand, we design
an inter-task regularization scheme to retain the knowledge acquired from
smaller problem sizes in the model training on a larger size. On the other
hand, we introduce an intra-task regularization scheme to consolidate the model
by imitating the latest desirable behaviors during training on each size.
Additionally, we exploit the experience replay to revisit instances of formerly
trained sizes for mitigating the catastrophic forgetting. Experimental results
show that our approach achieves predominantly superior performance across
various problem sizes (either seen or unseen in the training), as compared to
state-of-the-art deep models including the ones specialized for
generalizability enhancement. Meanwhile, the ablation studies on the key
designs manifest their synergistic effect in the proposed framework.

### [403] [Lost in the Middle: An Emergent Property from Information Retrieval Demands in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10276)
*Nikolaus Salvatore,Hao Wang,Qiong Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLMs在长文本中表现出"中间信息丢失"现象，这与人类记忆的首因效应和近因效应相似。研究发现这不是简单的信息丢失缺陷，而是预训练中不同信息检索需求适应的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究LLMs在长文本处理中表现出的位置偏差现象，特别是信息在中间位置性能下降的原因，理解这与人类记忆效应的相似性。

Method: 使用GPT-2和Llama变体从头开始训练，在模拟长期和短期记忆需求的简单人类记忆范式上进行实验，并扩展到序列补全任务。

Result: LLMs的U形性能曲线确实在训练中出现，近因效应与训练数据中的短期记忆需求直接相关，而首因效应由均匀的长期记忆需求诱导，并受自回归特性和注意力汇形成的影响。

Conclusion: 信息检索需求、模型架构和训练过程中的结构注意力动态共同导致了LLMs中观察到的位置偏差。

Abstract: The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) often degrades when crucial
information is in the middle of a long context, a "lost-in-the-middle"
phenomenon that mirrors the primacy and recency effects in human memory. We
propose that this behavior is not simply a flaw indicative of information loss
but an adaptation to different information retrieval demands during
pre-training: some tasks require uniform recall across the entire input (a
long-term memory demand), while others prioritize the most recent information
(a short-term memory demand). Consistent with this view, we show that this
U-shaped performance curve emerges when LLMs (GPT-2 and Llama variants) are
trained from scratch on two simple human memory paradigms simulating long-term
and short-term memory demands. Our analysis reveals that while the recency
effect directly aligns with short-term memory demand in the training data, the
primacy effect is induced by the uniform long-term memory demand and is
additionally influenced by the model's autoregressive properties and the
formation of attention sinks. Our main findings from simple human memory
paradigms also generalize to a sequence completion task, which more closely
resembles the next-token prediction process in LLM pre-training. Together, our
findings reveal how information retrieval demands, model architecture, and
structural attention dynamics during model training can jointly produce
positional bias observed in LLMs.

*Christopher Chiu,Silviu Pitis,Mihaela van der Schaar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: VivaBench是一个多轮临床推理基准测试，评估LLM在不确定性下进行顺序诊断推理的能力，发现当前模型在迭代推理中存在显著性能下降和多种认知错误模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前医学基准测试主要评估知识回忆，而真实临床推理是假设驱动的多轮过程，需要从有限信息中逐步完善诊断。

Method: 构建了1762个医生策划的临床情景作为交互式场景，模拟医学培训中的口试，要求代理主动探查相关发现、选择适当检查并在多步骤中综合信息。

Result: 当前LLM在完整临床描述下诊断能力良好，但在不确定性下的迭代诊断推理中性能显著下降，识别出四种常见认知错误模式。

Conclusion: VivaBench为评估对话式医学AI系统提供了标准化基准，揭示了当前LLM在不确定性下推理的基本局限性，并有助于更广泛的智能AI研究。

Abstract: Clinical reasoning in medicine is a hypothesis-driven process where
physicians refine diagnoses from limited information through targeted history,
physical examination, and diagnostic investigations. In contrast, current
medical benchmarks for large language models (LLMs) primarily assess knowledge
recall through single-turn questions, where complete clinical information is
provided upfront. To address this gap, we introduce VivaBench, a multi-turn
benchmark that evaluates sequential clinical reasoning in LLM agents. Our
dataset consists of 1762 physician-curated clinical vignettes structured as
interactive scenarios that simulate a (oral) examination in medical training,
requiring agents to actively probe for relevant findings, select appropriate
investigations, and synthesize information across multiple steps to reach a
diagnosis. While current LLMs demonstrate competence in diagnosing conditions
from well-described clinical presentations, their performance degrades
significantly when required to navigate iterative diagnostic reasoning under
uncertainty in our evaluation. Our analysis identified several failure modes
that mirror common cognitive errors in clinical practice, including: (1)
fixation on initial hypotheses, (2) inappropriate investigation ordering, (3)
premature diagnostic closure, and (4) failing to screen for critical
conditions. These patterns reveal fundamental limitations in how current LLMs
reason and make decisions under uncertainty. Through VivaBench, we provide a
standardized benchmark for evaluating conversational medical AI systems for
real-world clinical decision support. Beyond medical applications, we
contribute to the larger corpus of research on agentic AI by demonstrating how
sequential reasoning trajectories can diverge in complex decision-making
environments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ECHO是一个基于提示的框架，通过事后经验重放技术为语言模型智能体生成优化的反事实轨迹，从失败交互中创建合成正例，提高在陌生环境中的样本效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型智能体在新环境中从序列交互中学习时样本效率低下，这在交互成本高的环境中（如与人类交互或重置物理系统）严重阻碍了实用性。

Method: ECHO包含两个组件：事后规则（使用语言模型识别相关子目标并生成优化轨迹）和更新规则（在内存中维护压缩的轨迹表示）。

Result: 在XMiniGrid和PeopleJoinQA基准测试中，ECHO比普通语言智能体基线性能提升高达80%；在XMiniGrid中还优于Reflexion和AWM等复杂架构，通过更有效利用过往经验实现更快适应新环境。

Conclusion: ECHO框架通过事后优化有效提升了语言模型智能体在陌生环境中的学习效率和适应性，为交互成本高的应用场景提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Language model (LM) agents deployed in novel environments often exhibit poor
sample efficiency when learning from sequential interactions. This
significantly hinders the usefulness of such agents in environments where
interaction is costly (for example, when they interact with humans or reset
physical systems). While a number of existing LM agent architectures
incorporate various mechanisms for experience storage and reflection, they make
limited use of LMs' abilities to directly generate or reason about full
counterfactual trajectories. We introduce ECHO (Experience Consolidation via
Hindsight Optimization), a prompting framework that adapts hindsight experience
replay from reinforcement learning for language model agents. ECHO generates
optimized trajectories for alternative goals that could have been achieved
during failed attempts, effectively creating synthetic positive examples from
unsuccessful interactions. Our approach consists of two components: a hindsight
rule that uses the language model itself to identify relevant subgoals and
generate optimized trajectories, and an update rule that maintains compressed
trajectory representations in memory. We evaluate ECHO on stateful versions of
XMiniGrid, a text-based navigation and planning benchmark, and PeopleJoinQA, a
collaborative information-gathering enterprise simulation. Across both domains,
ECHO outperforms vanilla language agent baselines by up to 80%; in XMiniGrid,
it also outperforms a number of sophisticated agent architectures including
Reflexion and AWM, demonstrating faster adaptation to novel environments
through more effective utilization of past experiences.

TL;DR: 提出多视图图元组框架解决GNN在稠密图上效率低的问题，通过将图划分为多个子图捕获不同尺度的交互，在分子性质预测和宇宙学参数推断任务中优于单图基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统GNN在稠密图（如点云、分子相互作用）上效率低，常用的图稀疏化方法会丢失多尺度信息，需要一种能同时捕获局部和长程交互的方法。

Method: 引入多视图图元组框架，将图划分为不相交子图，使用受非交换算子理论启发的异构消息传递架构学习多视图表示。

Result: 在分子性质预测和宇宙学参数推断两个科学领域的应用中，多视图图元组模型比单图基线表现更好。

Conclusion: 多视图图元组框架比单图消息传递模型更强大和通用，能有效处理稠密图中的多尺度交互问题。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) typically scale with the number of graph edges,
making them well suited for sparse graphs but less efficient on dense graphs,
such as point clouds or molecular interactions. A common remedy is to sparsify
the graph via similarity thresholding or distance pruning, but this forces an
arbitrary choice of a single interaction scale and discards crucial information
from other scales. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a multi-view
graph-tuple framework. Instead of a single graph, our graph-tuple framework
partitions the graph into disjoint subgraphs, capturing primary local
interactions and weaker, long-range connections. We then learn multi-view
representations from the graph-tuple via a heterogeneous message-passing
architecture inspired by the theory of non-commuting operators, which we
formally prove is strictly more expressive and guarantees a lower oracle risk
compared to single-graph message-passing models. We instantiate our framework
on two scientific domains: molecular property prediction from feature-scarce
Coulomb matrices and cosmological parameter inference from geometric point
clouds. On both applications, our multi-view graph-tuple models demonstrate
better performance than single-graph baselines, highlighting the power and
versatility of our multi-view approach.

TL;DR: 开发了一种基于睡眠数据的非侵入性生物标志物，使用Transformer模型分析可穿戴设备或无线传感器的睡眠数据来检测抗抑郁药物摄入，实现远程、无创的日常依从性评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 抗抑郁药物不依从现象普遍存在，导致复发、住院、自杀风险和巨额可避免成本。现有方法要么侵入性强（血清检测、神经影像），要么基于代理指标且不准确（药片计数、药房续药）。

Method: 使用基于Transformer的模型分析来自消费级可穿戴设备或非接触式无线传感器的睡眠数据，推断抗抑郁药物摄入情况。

Result: 在包含62,000个夜晚、>20,000名参与者（1,800名抗抑郁药物使用者）的六个数据集中，生物标志物AUROC达到0.84，跨药物类别泛化良好，与剂量呈比例关系，对伴随精神药物保持稳健。纵向监测捕捉了真实世界的用药启动、减量和漏服情况。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了客观、可扩展的依从性监测方案，有潜力改善抑郁症护理和治疗结果。

Abstract: Antidepressant nonadherence is pervasive, driving relapse, hospitalization,
suicide risk, and billions in avoidable costs. Clinicians need tools that
detect adherence lapses promptly, yet current methods are either invasive
(serum assays, neuroimaging) or proxy-based and inaccurate (pill counts,
pharmacy refills). We present the first noninvasive biomarker that detects
antidepressant intake from a single night of sleep. A transformer-based model
analyzes sleep data from a consumer wearable or contactless wireless sensor to
infer antidepressant intake, enabling remote, effortless, daily adherence
assessment at home. Across six datasets comprising 62,000 nights from >20,000
participants (1,800 antidepressant users), the biomarker achieved AUROC = 0.84,
generalized across drug classes, scaled with dose, and remained robust to
concomitant psychotropics. Longitudinal monitoring captured real-world
initiation, tapering, and lapses. This approach offers objective, scalable
adherence surveillance with potential to improve depression care and outcomes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多组均值估计问题，需要在有限的采样预算下为所有组获得均匀准确的均值估计，这与传统多臂老虎机只关注最优臂不同。

Method: 使用Hanson-Wright不等式加强亚高斯方差集中性结果，设计无探索的非自适应和自适应算法，并扩展到上下文老虎机设置。

Result: 建立了比现有结果更紧的遗憾界，提出了利用侧信息的算法并提供了理论保证。

Conclusion: 无探索分配是多组均值估计的原则性和高效方法，在实验设计、个性化等需要多组推断的领域有应用潜力。

Abstract: We address the problem of multi-group mean estimation, which seeks to
allocate a finite sampling budget across multiple groups to obtain uniformly
accurate estimates of their means. Unlike classical multi-armed bandits, whose
objective is to minimize regret by identifying and exploiting the best arm, the
optimal allocation in this setting requires sampling every group on the order
of $\Theta(T)$ times. This fundamental distinction makes exploration-free
algorithms both natural and effective. Our work makes three contributions.
First, we strengthen the existing results on subgaussian variance concentration
using the Hanson-Wright inequality and identify a class of strictly subgaussian
distributions that yield sharper guarantees. Second, we design exploration-free
non-adaptive and adaptive algorithms, and we establish tighter regret bounds
than the existing results. Third, we extend the framework to contextual bandit
settings, an underexplored direction, and propose algorithms that leverage side
information with provable guarantees. Overall, these results position
exploration-free allocation as a principled and efficient approach to
multi-group mean estimation, with potential applications in experimental
design, personalization, and other domains requiring accurate multi-group
inference.

*Kenichi Satoh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NMF-LAB是一种新的监督式非负矩阵分解方法，将分类问题重新定义为非负矩阵三因子分解的逆问题，直接分解标签矩阵，无需外部分类器即可获得类别概率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准NMF是无监督的，无法直接利用类别标签。现有的监督或半监督扩展通常通过惩罚项或图约束来整合标签，但仍需要外部分类器。

Method: 将分类问题重新定义为非负矩阵三因子分解的逆问题，直接分解标签矩阵Y，而协变量A作为给定的解释变量。这种方法可以直接获得类别概率，无需单独的分类器。

Result: 在从基准数据集到大规模MNIST数据集的各种实验中，NMF-LAB实现了有竞争力的预测准确性，对噪声或不完整标签具有鲁棒性，并且能够扩展到高维问题，同时保持可解释性。

Conclusion: 通过在三因子NMF框架内统一回归和分类，NMF-LAB为现代分类任务提供了一种新颖、概率化和可扩展的方法。

Abstract: Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) is widely used for dimensionality
reduction and interpretable analysis, but standard formulations are
unsupervised and cannot directly exploit class labels. Existing supervised or
semi-supervised extensions usually incorporate labels only via penalties or
graph constraints, still requiring an external classifier. We propose
\textit{NMF-LAB} (Non-negative Matrix Factorization for Label Matrix), which
redefines classification as the inverse problem of non-negative matrix
tri-factorization (tri-NMF). Unlike joint NMF methods, which reconstruct both
features and labels, NMF-LAB directly factorizes the label matrix $Y$ as the
observation, while covariates $A$ are treated as given explanatory variables.
This yields a direct probabilistic mapping from covariates to labels,
distinguishing our method from label-matrix factorization approaches that
mainly model label correlations or impute missing labels. Our inversion offers
two key advantages: (i) class-membership probabilities are obtained directly
from the factorization without a separate classifier, and (ii) covariates,
including kernel-based similarities, can be seamlessly integrated to generalize
predictions to unseen samples. In addition, unlabeled data can be encoded as
uniform distributions, supporting semi-supervised learning. Experiments on
diverse datasets, from small-scale benchmarks to the large-scale MNIST dataset,
demonstrate that NMF-LAB achieves competitive predictive accuracy, robustness
to noisy or incomplete labels, and scalability to high-dimensional problems,
while preserving interpretability. By unifying regression and classification
within the tri-NMF framework, NMF-LAB provides a novel, probabilistic, and
scalable approach to modern classification tasks.

TL;DR: TreeDiff是一种基于蒙特卡洛树搜索的双空间扩散框架，用于可控图生成。它通过宏步扩展、双空间去噪和双空间验证器三个关键设计，在推理时实现更好的可控性和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的扩散模型在图生成中缺乏对期望属性的控制，导致质量不稳定且难以整合新目标。推理时引导方法虽然有所改进，但仍受限于局部启发式方法和有限的可控性。

Method: 提出TreeDiff框架：1）宏步扩展策略将多个去噪更新分组为单个转换；2）双空间去噪机制在潜在空间高效去噪，在图空间进行轻量离散校正；3）双空间验证器从部分去噪图中预测长期奖励。

Result: 在2D和3D分子生成基准测试中，TreeDiff在无条件和有条件设置下均达到最先进性能。推理时间扩展性良好，随着计算增加持续改进，而现有方法在有限资源下早期就达到平台期。

Conclusion: TreeDiff通过MCTS引导的双空间扩散框架，有效解决了图生成中的可控性问题，在保持计算可行性的同时显著提升了生成质量和可控性。

Abstract: Graph generation is a fundamental problem in graph learning with broad
applications across Web-scale systems, knowledge graphs, and scientific domains
such as drug and material discovery. Recent approaches leverage diffusion
models for step-by-step generation, yet unconditional diffusion offers little
control over desired properties, often leading to unstable quality and
difficulty in incorporating new objectives. Inference-time guidance methods
mitigate these issues by adjusting the sampling process without retraining, but
they remain inherently local, heuristic, and limited in controllability. To
overcome these limitations, we propose TreeDiff, a Monte Carlo Tree Search
(MCTS) guided dual-space diffusion framework for controllable graph generation.
TreeDiff is a plug-and-play inference-time method that expands the search space
while keeping computation tractable. Specifically, TreeDiff introduces three
key designs to make it practical and scalable: (1) a macro-step expansion
strategy that groups multiple denoising updates into a single transition,
reducing tree depth and enabling long-horizon exploration; (2) a dual-space
denoising mechanism that couples efficient latent-space denoising with
lightweight discrete correction in graph space, ensuring both scalability and
structural fidelity; and (3) a dual-space verifier that predicts long-term
rewards from partially denoised graphs, enabling early value estimation and
removing the need for full rollouts. Extensive experiments on 2D and 3D
molecular generation benchmarks, under both unconditional and conditional
settings, demonstrate that TreeDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance.
Notably, TreeDiff exhibits favorable inference-time scaling: it continues to
improve with additional computation, while existing inference-time methods
plateau early under limited resources.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了transformer在上下文学习中的算法机制，发现在分类任务中transformer仍通过梯度下降学习，但在核特征空间中进行，且softmax transformer具有上下文自适应学习率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解transformer仅通过输入提示中的示例学习新概念的能力（称为上下文学习）是智能行为的关键方面。现有理论研究主要基于简化假设，专注于线性自注意力和连续回归任务，而transformer通常在离散复杂任务上训练，需要填补这一研究空白。

Method: 将现有理论研究扩展到分类设置，使用非线性（特别是softmax）激活函数。分析transformer在核特征空间中的学习算法，研究softmax transformer的上下文自适应学习率特性。

Result: 发现transformer在分类任务中仍通过梯度下降进行上下文学习，但在核特征空间中进行，softmax transformer具有上下文自适应学习率。实证验证了softmax注意力对上下文具有更强的适应性。

Conclusion: 这些理论发现增强了在更现实设置下对上下文学习算法的理解，推动了直觉认识，并为向更大模型的理论桥梁奠定了基础。

Abstract: The remarkable ability of transformers to learn new concepts solely by
reading examples within the input prompt, termed in-context learning (ICL), is
a crucial aspect of intelligent behavior. Here, we focus on understanding the
learning algorithm transformers use to learn from context. Existing theoretical
work, often based on simplifying assumptions, has primarily focused on linear
self-attention and continuous regression tasks, finding transformers can learn
in-context by gradient descent. Given that transformers are typically trained
on discrete and complex tasks, we bridge the gap from this existing work to the
setting of classification, with non-linear (importantly, softmax) activation.
We find that transformers still learn to do gradient descent in-context, though
on functionals in the kernel feature space and with a context-adaptive learning
rate in the case of softmax transformer. These theoretical findings suggest a
greater adaptability to context for softmax attention, which we empirically
verify and study through ablations. Overall, we hope this enhances theoretical
understanding of in-context learning algorithms in more realistic settings,
pushes forward our intuitions and enables further theory bridging to larger
models.

Result: 在四个公共数据集上的实验表明，HiLoMoE实现了更好的性能-效率权衡，与非MoE基线相比，AUC平均提升0.20%，FLOPs减少18.5%。

Conclusion: HiLoMoE框架成功结合了垂直和水平扩展的优势，通过分层LoRA MoE实现了参数高效的整体扩展，在CTR预测任务中取得了显著的性能提升和计算效率改进。

Abstract: Deep models have driven significant advances in click-through rate (CTR)
prediction. While vertical scaling via layer stacking improves model
expressiveness, the layer-by-layer sequential computation poses challenges to
efficient scaling. Conversely, horizontal scaling through Mixture of Experts
(MoE) achieves efficient scaling by activating a small subset of experts in
parallel, but flat MoE layers may struggle to capture the hierarchical
structure inherent in recommendation tasks. To push the Return-On-Investment
(ROI) boundary, we explore the complementary strengths of both directions and
propose HiLoMoE, a hierarchical LoRA MoE framework that enables holistic
scaling in a parameter-efficient manner. Specifically, HiLoMoE employs
lightweight rank-1 experts for parameter-efficient horizontal scaling, and
stacks multiple MoE layers with hierarchical routing to enable combinatorially
diverse expert compositions. Unlike conventional stacking, HiLoMoE routes based
on prior layer scores rather than outputs, allowing all layers to execute in
parallel. A principled three-stage training framework ensures stable
optimization and expert diversity. Experiments on four public datasets show
that HiLoMoE achieving better performance-efficiency tradeoff, achieving an
average AUC improvement of 0.20\% in AUC and 18.5\% reduction in FLOPs compared
to the non-MoE baseline.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为MTL-FSL的新型多任务学习框架，通过引入特征相似性拉普拉斯惩罚项来建模特征间的时变关系，在阿尔茨海默病预测中取得了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多任务学习框架未考虑特征相关性的时变特性，而阿尔茨海默病数据具有纵向特性，需要建模特征间动态变化的关系。

Method: 提出MTL-FSL框架，引入特征相似性拉普拉斯惩罚项，同时考虑任务间的时间平滑性和特征间的动态相关性，使用ADMM算法解决非光滑优化问题。

Result: 在ADNI数据集上的实验表明，MTL-FSL框架优于各种基线方法，达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: MTL-FSL框架通过建模特征间时变关系，在阿尔茨海默病预测中提升了预测准确性和生物学可解释性。

Abstract: Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder in
aging populations, posing a significant and escalating burden on global
healthcare systems. While Multi-Tusk Learning (MTL) has emerged as a powerful
computational paradigm for modeling longitudinal AD data, existing frameworks
do not account for the time-varying nature of feature correlations. To address
this limitation, we propose a novel MTL framework, named Feature Similarity
Laplacian graph Multi-Task Learning (MTL-FSL). Our framework introduces a novel
Feature Similarity Laplacian (FSL) penalty that explicitly models the
time-varying relationships between features. By simultaneously considering
temporal smoothness among tasks and the dynamic correlations among features,
our model enhances both predictive accuracy and biological interpretability. To
solve the non-smooth optimization problem arising from our proposed penalty
terms, we adopt the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM)
algorithm. Experiments conducted on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging
Initiative (ADNI) dataset demonstrate that our proposed MTL-FSL framework
achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming various baseline methods.

*Masoud Makrehchi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文分析了反向监督策略的局限性，指出即使有量子计算等大幅加速技术，监督学习仍需要人类提供初始标签、定义目标和类别，因为搜索空间呈指数级增长。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨在计算能力大幅提升（如量子计算）的背景下，是否能够通过反向监督策略完全自动化机器学习流程，减少对人类监督的依赖。

Method: 分析反向监督策略，即在大型未标记数据集B上搜索标签分配，以最小化小型标记数据集A上的误差，研究其计算复杂性和实际可行性。

Result: 发现即使计算速度大幅提升，搜索空间仍呈指数级增长，无法消除对信息性标签或先验知识的需求。生成式AI可以作为标签放大器，但仍需要人类指定的目标、种子监督和验证。

Conclusion: 极端计算速度只能减少运行时间，但不能减少学习的基本监督需求。初始的人类（或人类级别）输入仍然是必要的，以确保系统与预期任务对齐。

Abstract: We analyze a reversed-supervision strategy that searches over labelings of a
large unlabeled set \(B\) to minimize error on a small labeled set \(A\). The
search space is \(2^n\), and the resulting complexity remains exponential even
under large constant-factor speedups (e.g., quantum or massively parallel
hardware). Consequently, arbitrarily fast -- but not exponentially faster --
computation does not obviate the need for informative labels or priors. In
practice, the machine learning pipeline still requires an initial human
contribution: specifying the objective, defining classes, and providing a seed
set of representative annotations that inject inductive bias and align models
with task semantics. Synthetic labels from generative AI can partially
substitute provided their quality is human-grade and anchored by a
human-specified objective, seed supervision, and validation. In this view,
generative models function as \emph{label amplifiers}, leveraging small
human-curated cores via active, semi-supervised, and self-training loops, while
humans retain oversight for calibration, drift detection, and failure auditing.
Thus, extreme computational speed reduces wall-clock time but not the
fundamental supervision needs of learning; initial human (or human-grade) input
remains necessary to ground the system in the intended task.

Motivation: 动物运动模拟器对行为研究很重要，但现实世界转移模型未知，仅靠数学模型不足，需要既能重现真实轨迹又支持奖励驱动的模拟器。

Method: 使用深度强化学习和反事实模拟，将运动变量估计为RL框架中的动作，采用距离伪奖励来对齐网络空间和物理空间的状态。

Conclusion: 该方法能够模拟和阐明复杂的多动物行为，具有生成灵活假设轨迹的潜力。

Abstract: Simulators of animal movements play a valuable role in studying behavior.
Advances in imitation learning for robotics have expanded possibilities for
reproducing human and animal movements. A key challenge for realistic
multi-animal simulation in biology is bridging the gap between unknown
real-world transition models and their simulated counterparts. Because
locomotion dynamics are seldom known, relying solely on mathematical models is
insufficient; constructing a simulator that both reproduces real trajectories
and supports reward-driven optimization remains an open problem. We introduce a
data-driven simulator for multi-animal behavior based on deep reinforcement
learning and counterfactual simulation. We address the ill-posed nature of the
problem caused by high degrees of freedom in locomotion by estimating movement
variables of an incomplete transition model as actions within an RL framework.
We also employ a distance-based pseudo-reward to align and compare states
between cyber and physical spaces. Validated on artificial agents, flies,
newts, and silkmoth, our approach achieves higher reproducibility of
species-specific behaviors and improved reward acquisition compared with
standard imitation and RL methods. Moreover, it enables counterfactual behavior
prediction in novel experimental settings and supports multi-individual
modeling for flexible what-if trajectory generation, suggesting its potential
to simulate and elucidate complex multi-animal behaviors.

Motivation: 现有方法使用共享嵌入层处理所有通道，忽略了通道特异性信息，造成了表示瓶颈。

Method: 引入共享-辅助嵌入(SAE)框架，将嵌入分解为共享基础组件和通道特定辅助组件，并基于观察到的低秩和聚类特性设计参数高效的LightSAE模块。

Result: 在9个物联网数据集和4个骨干架构上的实验表明，LightSAE仅增加4.0%参数即可实现高达22.8%的MSE改进。

Conclusion: LightSAE通过利用通道特异性信息的结构模式，有效解决了多变量时间序列预测中的表示瓶颈问题，实现了参数效率和性能的良好平衡。

Abstract: Modern Internet of Things (IoT) systems generate massive, heterogeneous
multivariate time series data. Accurate Multivariate Time Series Forecasting
(MTSF) of such data is critical for numerous applications. However, existing
methods almost universally employ a shared embedding layer that processes all
channels identically, creating a representational bottleneck that obscures
valuable channel-specific information. To address this challenge, we introduce
a Shared-Auxiliary Embedding (SAE) framework that decomposes the embedding into
a shared base component capturing common patterns and channel-specific
auxiliary components modeling unique deviations. Within this decomposition, we
\rev{empirically observe} that the auxiliary components tend to exhibit
low-rank and clustering characteristics, a structural pattern that is
significantly less apparent when using purely independent embeddings.
Consequently, we design LightSAE, a parameter-efficient embedding module that
operationalizes these observed characteristics through low-rank factorization
and a shared, gated component pool. Extensive experiments across 9 IoT-related
datasets and 4 backbone architectures demonstrate LightSAE's effectiveness,
achieving MSE improvements of up to 22.8\% with only 4.0\% parameter increase.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型部署面临内存和延迟瓶颈，需要灵活的量化技术来平衡精度和效率。现有方法需要支持多精度推理以适应不同的运行时约束。

Method: 基于二进制编码量化(BCQ)扩展，将权重表示为二进制位平面和对应的缩放因子，支持位平面级计算。采用渐进精度扩展机制，在启用额外位时重用先前分配的二进制码。

Conclusion: AnyBCQ通过算法灵活性与硬件效率的对齐，为多精度LLM部署提供了实用基础，能够适应多样化的服务级目标。

Abstract: The deployment of large language models (LLMs) is increasingly constrained by
memory and latency bottlenecks, motivating the need for quantization techniques
that flexibly balance accuracy and efficiency. Recent work has introduced
multi-precision models, which enable inference at multiple precisions within a
single model depending on runtime constraints. To support such flexibility,
quantized weights are often stored as bit-planes, where hardware efficiency
improves when the compute operates directly at the bit-plane level and
activates only the precision required by each request. In this work, we present
AnyBCQ, a hardware-friendly multi-precision extension of Binary-Coded
Quantization (BCQ) that supports direct bit-plane operations. By representing
weights as binary bit-planes with corresponding scale factors, AnyBCQ enables
bit-plane-level computation and maps naturally to accelerator-friendly,
bit-parallel arithmetic. Our progressive precision expansion mechanism
incrementally refines scaling factors while reusing previously assigned binary
codes, yielding monotonic improvements in accuracy as additional bits are
enabled. We further co-design a specialized kernel that exploits the BCQ
structure to support dynamic per-request precision selection with negligible
overhead. Experiments on recent LLMs demonstrate that AnyBCQ significantly
narrows the accuracy drop in the low-bit regime (e.g. 2-bit), remains
competitive at higher precision, and achieves throughput gains of up to 3.0x
over half precision and 1.2x over state-of-the-art multi-precision methods. By
aligning algorithmic flexibility with hardware efficiency, AnyBCQ provides a
practical foundation for multi-precision LLM deployment across diverse
service-level objectives.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于锚点的最大差异(AMD)方法，用于相对相似性测试，通过同时学习合适的假设和核函数来解决传统方法中核选择与假设规范之间的冲突问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于核的相对相似性测试方法在手动指定备择假设后选择核函数，这会导致测试结果存在偏差，因为一旦假设固定，总能找到使该假设被拒绝的核函数。

Method: 提出AMD方法，在深度核空间中定义相对相似性为(U,P)和(U,Q)距离的最大差异。测试分为两个阶段：第一阶段在深度核空间估计AMD并推断潜在假设；第二阶段评估潜在假设的统计显著性。

Result: 通过理论验证和基准数据集上的广泛实验证明了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: AMD方法通过同时学习假设和核函数，解决了相对相似性测试中的核选择问题，提供了一种更可靠的测试框架。

Abstract: The relative similarity testing aims to determine which of the distributions,
P or Q, is closer to an anchor distribution U. Existing kernel-based approaches
often test the relative similarity with a fixed kernel in a manually specified
alternative hypothesis, e.g., Q is closer to U than P. Although kernel
selection is known to be important to kernel-based testing methods, the
manually specified hypothesis poses a significant challenge for kernel
selection in relative similarity testing: Once the hypothesis is specified
first, we can always find a kernel such that the hypothesis is rejected. This
challenge makes relative similarity testing ill-defined when we want to select
a good kernel after the hypothesis is specified. In this paper, we cope with
this challenge via learning a proper hypothesis and a kernel simultaneously,
instead of learning a kernel after manually specifying the hypothesis. We
propose an anchor-based maximum discrepancy (AMD), which defines the relative
similarity as the maximum discrepancy between the distances of (U, P) and (U,
Q) in a space of deep kernels. Based on AMD, our testing incorporates two
phases. In Phase I, we estimate the AMD over the deep kernel space and infer
the potential hypothesis. In Phase II, we assess the statistical significance
of the potential hypothesis, where we propose a unified testing framework to
derive thresholds for tests over different possible hypotheses from Phase I.
Lastly, we validate our method theoretically and demonstrate its effectiveness
via extensive experiments on benchmark datasets. Codes are publicly available

Abstract: Designing protein binders targeting specific sites, which requires to
generate realistic and functional interaction patterns, is a fundamental
challenge in drug discovery. Current structure-based generative models are
limited in generating nterfaces with sufficient rationality and
interpretability. In this paper, we propose Retrieval-Augmented Diffusion for
Aligned interface (RADiAnce), a new framework that leverages known interfaces
to guide the design of novel binders. By unifying retrieval and generation in a
shared contrastive latent space, our model efficiently identifies relevant
interfaces for a given binding site and seamlessly integrates them through a
conditional latent diffusion generator, enabling cross-domain interface
transfer. Extensive exeriments show that RADiAnce significantly outperforms
baseline models across multiple metrics, including binding affinity and
recovery of geometries and interactions. Additional experimental results
validate cross-domain generalization, demonstrating that retrieving interfaces
from diverse domains, such as peptides, antibodies, and protein fragments,
enhances the generation performance of binders for other domains. Our work
establishes a new paradigm for protein binder design that successfully bridges
retrieval-based knowledge and generative AI, opening new possibilities for drug
discovery.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种梯度增强自训练PINN方法(gST-PINN)，通过梯度伪点自学习算法解决传统PINNs精度低、训练慢、缺乏标记数据等问题，在多个PDE问题上表现优于标准PINN方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统PINNs存在精度有限、训练动态缓慢、缺乏标记数据以及多物理场交互处理不足等挑战，需要改进方法来克服这些问题。

Method: 提出梯度增强自训练PINN(gST-PINN)，引入基于梯度的伪点自学习算法，无需标记数据即可有效求解PDEs，是纯半监督方法。

Result: 在三个不同类型的PDE问题上测试，gST-PINN表现优于标准PINN。例如Burgers方程达到10^-3 MSE，扩散-吸附方程达到10^-4 MSE，而gST-PINN继续下降至10^-5 MSE，显示更好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: gST-PINN在缺乏标记数据的情况下，能够有效解决PINNs的低精度和收敛问题，泛化了PINN和gPINN方法，在所有情况下都优于标准PINN方法。

Abstract: Partial differential equations (PDEs) provide a mathematical foundation for
simulating and understanding intricate behaviors in both physical sciences and
engineering. With the growing capabilities of deep learning, data$-$driven
approaches like Physics$-$Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have been developed,
offering a mesh$-$free, analytic type framework for efficiently solving PDEs
across a wide range of applications. However, traditional PINNs often struggle
with challenges such as limited precision, slow training dynamics, lack of
labeled data availability, and inadequate handling of multi$-$physics
interactions. To overcome these challenging issues of PINNs, we proposed a
Gradient Enhanced Self$-$Training PINN (gST$-$PINN) method that specifically
introduces a gradient based pseudo point self$-$learning algorithm for solving
PDEs. We tested the proposed method on three different types of PDE problems
from various fields, each representing distinct scenarios. The effectiveness of
the proposed method is evident, as the PINN approach for solving the Burgers$'$
equation attains a mean square error (MSE) on the order of $10^{-3}$, while the
diffusion$-$sorption equation achieves an MSE on the order of $10^{-4}$ after
12,500 iterations, with no further improvement as the iterations increase. In
contrast, the MSE for both PDEs in the gST$-$PINN model continues to decrease,
demonstrating better generalization and reaching an MSE on the order of
$10^{-5}$ after 18,500 iterations. Furthermore, the results show that the
proposed purely semi$-$supervised gST$-$PINN consistently outperforms the
standard PINN method in all cases, even when solution of the PDEs are
unavailable. It generalizes both PINN and Gradient$-$enhanced PINN (gPINN), and
can be effectively applied in scenarios prone to low accuracy and convergence
issues, particularly in the absence of labeled data.

Conclusion: f-influence框架通过考虑训练随机性解决了现有影响力估计方法的不稳定性问题，f-INE算法的高效性使其能够扩展到大型语言模型的实际应用中。

Abstract: Influence estimation methods promise to explain and debug machine learning by
estimating the impact of individual samples on the final model. Yet, existing
methods collapse under training randomness: the same example may appear
critical in one run and irrelevant in the next. Such instability undermines
their use in data curation or cleanup since it is unclear if we indeed
deleted/kept the correct datapoints. To overcome this, we introduce
*f-influence* -- a new influence estimation framework grounded in hypothesis
testing that explicitly accounts for training randomness, and establish
desirable properties that make it suitable for reliable influence estimation.
We also design a highly efficient algorithm **f**-**IN**fluence **E**stimation
(**f-INE**) that computes f-influence **in a single training run**. Finally, we
scale up f-INE to estimate influence of instruction tuning data on Llama-3.1-8B
and show it can reliably detect poisoned samples that steer model opinions,
demonstrating its utility for data cleanup and attributing model behavior.

Abstract: Healthcare research and development face significant obstacles due to data
scarcity and stringent privacy regulations, such as HIPAA and the GDPR,
restricting access to essential real-world medical data. These limitations
impede innovation, delay robust AI model creation, and hinder advancements in
patient-centered care. Synthetic data generation offers a transformative
solution by producing artificial datasets that emulate real data statistics
while safeguarding patient privacy. We introduce a novel hybrid framework for
high-fidelity healthcare data synthesis integrating five augmentation methods:
noise injection, interpolation, Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) sampling,
Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) sampling, and SMOTE, combined via a
reinforcement learning-based dynamic weight selection mechanism. Its key
innovations include advanced calibration techniques -- moment matching, full
histogram matching, soft and adaptive soft histogram matching, and iterative
refinement -- that align marginal distributions and preserve joint feature
dependencies. Evaluated on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (UCI Repository) and
Khulna Medical College cardiology datasets, our calibrated hybrid achieves
Wasserstein distances as low as 0.001 and Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistics around
0.01, demonstrating near-zero marginal discrepancy. Pairwise trend scores
surpass 90%, and Nearest Neighbor Adversarial Accuracy approaches 50%,
confirming robust privacy protection. Downstream classifiers trained on
synthetic data achieve up to 94% accuracy and F1 scores above 93%, comparable
to models trained on real data. This scalable, privacy-preserving approach
matches state-of-the-art methods, sets new benchmarks for joint-distribution
fidelity in healthcare, and supports sensitive AI applications.

Conclusion: 该集成策略能同时优化迁移路径和目标任务性能，有效提升域适应过程的效果。

Abstract: Continuous Domain Adaptation (CDA) effectively bridges significant domain
shifts by progressively adapting from the source domain through intermediate
domains to the target domain. However, selecting intermediate domains without
explicit metadata remains a substantial challenge that has not been extensively
explored in existing studies. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel
framework that combines reinforcement learning with feature disentanglement to
conduct domain path selection in an unsupervised CDA setting. Our approach
introduces an innovative unsupervised reward mechanism that leverages the
distances between latent domain embeddings to facilitate the identification of
optimal transfer paths. Furthermore, by disentangling features, our method
facilitates the calculation of unsupervised rewards using domain-specific
features and promotes domain adaptation by aligning domain-invariant features.
This integrated strategy is designed to simultaneously optimize transfer paths
and target task performance, enhancing the effectiveness of domain adaptation
processes. Extensive empirical evaluations on datasets such as Rotated MNIST
and ADNI demonstrate substantial improvements in prediction accuracy and domain
selection efficiency, establishing our method's superiority over traditional
CDA approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现现有基准测试在评估大型语言模型强化学习进展方面存在缺陷，训练集和测试集性能几乎相同，无法可靠区分进展。

Method: 引入诊断套件和Oracle性能差距(OPG)指标，量化训练集与测试集性能差异，并通过压力测试分析泛化能力。

Result: 尽管基准测试得分高，但现有RL方法在分布偏移、难度变化和反事实场景下泛化能力差，现有基准无法揭示这些缺陷。

Conclusion: 当前基准测试不足以评估泛化能力，提出三个核心设计原则：足够难度、平衡评估和分布鲁棒性。

Abstract: Current benchmarks are inadequate for evaluating progress in reinforcement
learning (RL) for large language models (LLMs).Despite recent benchmark gains
reported for RL, we find that training on these benchmarks' training sets
achieves nearly the same performance as training directly on the test sets,
suggesting that the benchmarks cannot reliably separate further progress.To
study this phenomenon, we introduce a diagnostic suite and the Oracle
Performance Gap (OPG) metric that quantifies the performance difference between
training on the train split versus the test split of a benchmark. We further
analyze this phenomenon with stress tests and find that, despite strong
benchmark scores, existing RL methods struggle to generalize across
distribution shifts, varying levels of difficulty, and counterfactual
scenarios: shortcomings that current benchmarks fail to reveal.We conclude that
current benchmarks are insufficient for evaluating generalization and propose
three core principles for designing more faithful benchmarks: sufficient
difficulty, balanced evaluation, and distributional robustness.

Motivation: 强化学习中数据的序列性质破坏了经典泛化界的独立性假设，需要开发能够处理马尔可夫依赖性的泛化保证方法。

Method: 推导了考虑马尔可夫依赖性的PAC-Bayesian泛化界，基于链的混合时间；开发了PB-SAC算法，在训练过程中优化该界来指导探索。

Result: 该界为现代离策略算法（如Soft Actor-Critic）提供了非平凡的泛化保证；在连续控制任务上的实验表明，该方法在保持竞争力的同时提供了有意义的置信度证书。

Conclusion: 提出的PAC-Bayesian泛化界有效克服了强化学习中数据依赖性的挑战，为算法提供了实用的泛化保证，同时通过PB-SAC算法实现了理论指导下的有效探索。

Abstract: We derive a novel PAC-Bayesian generalization bound for reinforcement
learning that explicitly accounts for Markov dependencies in the data, through
the chain's mixing time. This contributes to overcoming challenges in obtaining
generalization guarantees for reinforcement learning, where the sequential
nature of data breaks the independence assumptions underlying classical bounds.
Our bound provides non-vacuous certificates for modern off-policy algorithms
like Soft Actor-Critic. We demonstrate the bound's practical utility through
PB-SAC, a novel algorithm that optimizes the bound during training to guide

### [426] [Multi-scale Frequency-Aware Adversarial Network for Parkinson's Disease Assessment Using Wearable Sensors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10558)
*Weiming Zhao,Xulong Wang,Jun Qi,Yun Yang,Po Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了MFAM模型，通过频率分解和多实例学习框架，提升帕金森病严重程度评估的准确性和特异性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有通用时间序列模型缺乏病理特异性，难以捕捉与帕金森病高度相关的细微信号；同时症状的时间稀疏性导致关键诊断特征被传统聚合方法稀释。

Method: 使用频率分解模块结合医学先验知识增强特征特异性；引入基于注意力的多实例学习框架，自适应聚焦最具诊断价值的稀疏片段。

Result: 在公开PADS数据集和私有数据集上的实验表明，MFAM在处理复杂临床时间序列方面优于通用时间序列模型。

Conclusion: MFAM为帕金森病严重程度的自动化评估提供了一个有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Severity assessment of Parkinson's disease (PD) using wearable sensors offers
an effective, objective basis for clinical management. However, general-purpose
time series models often lack pathological specificity in feature extraction,
making it difficult to capture subtle signals highly correlated with
PD.Furthermore, the temporal sparsity of PD symptoms causes key diagnostic
features to be easily "diluted" by traditional aggregation methods, further
complicating assessment. To address these issues, we propose the Multi-scale
Frequency-Aware Adversarial Multi-Instance Network (MFAM). This model enhances
feature specificity through a frequency decomposition module guided by medical
prior knowledge. Furthermore, by introducing an attention-based multi-instance
learning (MIL) framework, the model can adaptively focus on the most
diagnostically valuable sparse segments.We comprehensively validated MFAM on
both the public PADS dataset for PD versus differential diagnosis (DD) binary
classification and a private dataset for four-class severity assessment.
Experimental results demonstrate that MFAM outperforms general-purpose time
series models in handling complex clinical time series with specificity,
providing a promising solution for automated assessment of PD severity.

*Zirui Wan,Stefan Vlaski*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种联邦学习和去中心化学习的新算法框架，通过高斯马尔可夫随机场建模任务关系，联合学习任务关系和局部模型，解决了传统共识方法在异构数据下的统计次优问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于共识的联邦和去中心化学习策略在存在异构本地数据或任务分布时统计上不是最优的，现有多任务或个性化策略要么需要精确的先验任务关系知识，要么完全非参数化，需要在这两个极端之间找到平衡。

Method: 通过建模任务关系为具有未知精度矩阵的高斯马尔可夫随机场，开发了一种联合学习任务关系和局部模型的策略，使智能体能够以与其个体数据分布一致的方式自组织。

Result: 理论分析量化了学习到的任务关系的质量，数值实验证明了其实际有效性。

Conclusion: 该算法框架在传统共识方法和完全非参数化方法之间取得了平衡，通过联合学习任务关系和局部模型，使智能体能够在追求局部最优模型的同时从彼此获益。

Abstract: Classical consensus-based strategies for federated and decentralized learning
are statistically suboptimal in the presence of heterogeneous local data or
task distributions. As a result, in recent years, there has been growing
interest in multitask or personalized strategies, which allow individual agents
to benefit from one another in pursuing locally optimal models without
enforcing consensus. Existing strategies require either precise prior knowledge
of the underlying task relationships or are fully non-parametric and instead
rely on meta-learning or proximal constructions. In this work, we introduce an
algorithmic framework that strikes a balance between these extremes. By
modeling task relationships through a Gaussian Markov Random Field with an
unknown precision matrix, we develop a strategy that jointly learns both the
task relationships and the local models, allowing agents to self-organize in a
way consistent with their individual data distributions. Our theoretical
analysis quantifies the quality of the learned relationship, and our numerical
experiments demonstrate its practical effectiveness.

Abstract: Self-supervised representation learning has achieved impressive empirical
success, yet its theoretical understanding remains limited. In this work, we
provide a theoretical perspective by formulating self-supervised representation
learning as an approximation to supervised representation learning objectives.
Based on this formulation, we derive a loss function closely related to popular
contrastive losses such as InfoNCE, offering insight into their underlying
principles. Our derivation naturally introduces the concepts of prototype
representation bias and a balanced contrastive loss, which help explain and
improve the behavior of self-supervised learning algorithms. We further show
how components of our theoretical framework correspond to established practices
in contrastive learning. Finally, we empirically validate the effect of
balancing positive and negative pair interactions. All theoretical proofs are
provided in the appendix, and our code is included in the supplementary
material.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从算法视角理解智能体如何通过生成程序压缩感官流，探索组合对称性作为结构先验在智能体建模中的作用。

Method: 将智能体建模为与感官流耦合的神经动力系统，分析对称性对智能体方程和读出的等变性约束，以及动力学中的守恒量和降维流形。

Result: 对称性导致智能体动力学中的守恒量（Noether风格标签）和降维不变流形，在缓慢漂移下保持低维特性，形成与伪群分解对齐的层次结构。

Conclusion: 组合对称性为深度模型的组合性优势提供了几何解释，并启发了基于对称性的预测编码框架，其中高层仅接收沿对称方向的粗粒度残差变换。

Abstract: In the algorithmic (Kolmogorov) view, agents are programs that track and
compress sensory streams using generative programs. We propose a framework
where the relevant structural prior is simplicity (Solomonoff) understood as
\emph{compositional symmetry}: natural streams are well described by (local)
actions of finite-parameter Lie pseudogroups on geometrically and topologically
complex low-dimensional configuration manifolds (latent spaces). Modeling the
agent as a generic neural dynamical system coupled to such streams, we show
that accurate world-tracking imposes (i) \emph{structural constraints} --
equivariance of the agent's constitutive equations and readouts -- and (ii)
\emph{dynamical constraints}: under static inputs, symmetry induces conserved
quantities (Noether-style labels) in the agent dynamics and confines
trajectories to reduced invariant manifolds; under slow drift, these manifolds
move but remain low-dimensional. This yields a hierarchy of reduced manifolds
aligned with the compositional factorization of the pseudogroup, providing a
geometric account of the ``blessing of compositionality'' in deep models. We
connect these ideas to the Spencer formalism for Lie pseudogroups and formulate
a symmetry-based, self-contained version of predictive coding in which higher
layers receive only \emph{coarse-grained residual transformations}
(prediction-error coordinates) along symmetry directions unresolved at lower
layers.

Result: 在多个公开EEG数据集上的实验表明，FusionGen显著优于现有增强技术，在分类准确率上取得了显著提升

Conclusion: FusionGen框架能有效解决EEG数据稀缺问题，确保数据多样性和可训练性，为脑机接口的实际应用提供了有力支持

Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) provide potential for applications ranging
from medical rehabilitation to cognitive state assessment by establishing
direct communication pathways between the brain and external devices via
electroencephalography (EEG). However, EEG-based BCIs are severely constrained
by data scarcity and significant inter-subject variability, which hinder the
generalization and applicability of EEG decoding models in practical settings.
To address these challenges, we propose FusionGen, a novel EEG data generation
framework based on disentangled representation learning and feature fusion. By
integrating features across trials through a feature matching fusion module and
combining them with a lightweight feature extraction and reconstruction
pipeline, FusionGen ensures both data diversity and trainability under limited
data constraints. Extensive experiments on multiple publicly available EEG
datasets demonstrate that FusionGen significantly outperforms existing
augmentation techniques, yielding notable improvements in classification
accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 构建学习模型时经常需要评估大量中间模型（如特征选择、模型结构搜索、参数调优等），这些评估结果会影响后续模型探索决策。虽然先验知识可以提供初始质量估计，但真实性能只有在评估后才能揭示。

Method: 将中间模型探索问题形式化为Lipschitz空间中未知值函数的一般预算分配问题。

Result: 提出了一种在有限预算下优化探索中间模型空间的方法框架。

Conclusion: 该工作为解决模型构建过程中中间模型评估的资源分配问题提供了理论框架和解决方案。

Abstract: Building learning models frequently requires evaluating numerous intermediate
models. Examples include models considered during feature selection, model
structure search, and parameter tunings. The evaluation of an intermediate
model influences subsequent model exploration decisions. Although prior
knowledge can provide initial quality estimates, true performance is only
revealed after evaluation. In this work, we address the challenge of optimally
allocating a bounded budget to explore the space of intermediate models. We
formalize this as a general budget allocation problem over unknown-value
functions within a Lipschitz space.

Conclusion: EDGAN模型在表达能力和简洁性之间取得了良好平衡，为股票价格预测提供了有效的深度学习方法，解决了GAN在金融领域应用的关键挑战。

Abstract: Forecasting stock prices remains challenging due to the volatile and
non-linear nature of financial markets. Despite the promise of deep learning,
issues such as mode collapse, unstable training, and difficulty in capturing
temporal and feature level correlations have limited the applications of GANs
in this domain. We propose a GRU-based Encoder-Decoder GAN (EDGAN) model that
strikes a balance between expressive power and simplicity. The model introduces
key innovations such as a temporal decoder with residual connections for
precise reconstruction, conditioning on static and dynamic covariates for
contextual learning, and a windowing mechanism to capture temporal dynamics.
Here, the generator uses a dense encoder-decoder framework with residual GRU
blocks. Extensive experiments on diverse stock datasets demonstrate that EDGAN
achieves superior forecasting accuracy and training stability, even in volatile
markets. It consistently outperforms traditional GAN variants in forecasting
accuracy and convergence stability under market conditions.

Motivation: 锂离子电池容量随充放电循环次数增加而下降，威胁储能系统耐久性。现有方法对每个循环中电池状态信息的利用不足，需要更准确的容量预测方法。

Conclusion: SDG-L框架能够有效利用电池状态信息进行容量预测，为储能系统的效率和可靠性提供保障。

Abstract: Lithium-ion batteries are becoming increasingly omnipresent in energy supply.
However, the durability of energy storage using lithium-ion batteries is
threatened by their dropping capacity with the growing number of
charging/discharging cycles. An accurate capacity prediction is the key to
ensure system efficiency and reliability, where the exploitation of battery
state information in each cycle has been largely undervalued. In this paper, we
propose a semiparametric deep Gaussian process regression framework named SDG-L
to give predictions based on the modeling of time series battery state data. By
introducing an LSTM feature extractor, the SDG-L is specially designed to
better utilize the auxiliary profiling information during charging/discharging
process. In experimental studies based on NASA dataset, our proposed method
obtains an average test MSE error of 1.2%. We also show that SDG-L achieves
better performance compared to existing works and validate the framework using
ablation studies.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ImpMIA是一种基于神经网络隐式偏差的白盒成员推理攻击方法，无需依赖参考模型，在仅能访问模型权重和训练数据超集的现实场景中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的黑盒成员推理攻击依赖不现实的假设：攻击者知道训练超参数、非训练样本与训练数据同分布、评估集中训练数据比例已知。这些假设在实际中很少成立，导致性能显著下降。

Method: 利用最大间隔隐式偏差理论，通过KKT最优性条件识别训练样本，找到梯度最能重构训练模型参数的样本。

Result: 在仅能访问模型权重和训练数据超集的现实设置中，ImpMIA相比黑盒和白盒攻击都达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: ImpMIA通过利用神经网络的隐式偏差，摆脱了对参考模型和不现实假设的依赖，在现实场景中实现了有效的成员推理攻击。

Abstract: Determining which data samples were used to train a model-known as Membership
Inference Attack (MIA)-is a well-studied and important problem with
implications for data privacy. Black-box methods presume access only to the
model's outputs and often rely on training auxiliary reference models. While
they have shown strong empirical performance, they rely on assumptions that
rarely hold in real-world settings: (i) the attacker knows the training
hyperparameters; (ii) all available non-training samples come from the same
distribution as the training data; and (iii) the fraction of training data in
the evaluation set is known. In this paper, we demonstrate that removing these
assumptions leads to a significant drop in the performance of black-box
attacks. We introduce ImpMIA, a Membership Inference Attack that exploits the
Implicit Bias of neural networks, hence removes the need to rely on any
reference models and their assumptions. ImpMIA is a white-box attack -- a
setting which assumes access to model weights and is becoming increasingly
realistic given that many models are publicly available (e.g., via Hugging
Face). Building on maximum-margin implicit bias theory, ImpMIA uses the
Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) optimality conditions to identify training samples.
This is done by finding the samples whose gradients most strongly reconstruct
the trained model's parameters. As a result, ImpMIA achieves state-of-the-art
performance compared to both black and white box attacks in realistic settings
where only the model weights and a superset of the training data are available.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前蛋白质结构表示方法面临SE(3)流形复杂性、离散标记化或多训练目标等挑战，这些因素阻碍了模型优化和泛化能力。

Method: 使用具有瓶颈设计的非等变扩散变换器，通过单一流匹配目标进行端到端训练，将蛋白质骨架坐标从E(3)映射到连续紧凑潜空间。

Result: ProteinAE实现了最先进的重建质量，优于现有自编码器。基于该潜空间的扩散模型在结构生成方面与领先的结构方法竞争，并显著优于先前的潜空间方法。

Conclusion: ProteinAE提供了一种简化的蛋白质结构表示学习框架，通过连续潜空间实现了高质量的结构重建和生成，为蛋白质科学提供了强大的基础。

Abstract: Developing effective representations of protein structures is essential for
advancing protein science, particularly for protein generative modeling.
Current approaches often grapple with the complexities of the SE(3) manifold,
rely on discrete tokenization, or the need for multiple training objectives,
all of which can hinder the model optimization and generalization. We introduce
ProteinAE, a novel and streamlined protein diffusion autoencoder designed to
overcome these challenges by directly mapping protein backbone coordinates from
E(3) into a continuous, compact latent space. ProteinAE employs a
non-equivariant Diffusion Transformer with a bottleneck design for efficient
compression and is trained end-to-end with a single flow matching objective,
substantially simplifying the optimization pipeline. We demonstrate that
ProteinAE achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality, outperforming
existing autoencoders. The resulting latent space serves as a powerful
foundation for a latent diffusion model that bypasses the need for explicit
equivariance. This enables efficient, high-quality structure generation that is
competitive with leading structure-based approaches and significantly
outperforms prior latent-based methods. Code is available at

Abstract: Retrosynthesis is one of the domains transformed by the rise of generative
models, and it is one where the problem of nonsensical or erroneous outputs
(hallucinations) is particularly insidious: reliable assessment of synthetic
plans is time-consuming, with automatic methods lacking. In this work, we
present RetroTrim, a retrosynthesis system that successfully avoids nonsensical
plans on a set of challenging drug-like targets. Compared to common baselines
in the field, our system is not only the sole method that succeeds in filtering
out hallucinated reactions, but it also results in the highest number of
high-quality paths overall. The key insight behind RetroTrim is the combination
of diverse reaction scoring strategies, based on machine learning models and
existing chemical databases. We show that our scoring strategies capture
different classes of hallucinations by analyzing them on a dataset of labeled
retrosynthetic intermediates. To measure the performance of retrosynthesis
systems, we propose a novel evaluation protocol for reactions and synthetic
paths based on a structured review by expert chemists. Using this protocol, we
compare systems on a set of 32 novel targets, curated to reflect recent trends
in drug structures. While the insights behind our methodology are broadly
applicable to retrosynthesis, our focus is on targets in the drug-like domain.
By releasing our benchmark targets and the details of our evaluation protocol,
we hope to inspire further research into reliable retrosynthesis.

Abstract: Control Co-Design (CCD) integrates physical and control system design to
improve the performance of dynamic and autonomous systems. Despite advances in
uncertainty-aware CCD methods, real-world uncertainties remain highly
unpredictable. Multi-generation design addresses this challenge by considering
the full lifecycle of a product: data collected from each generation informs
the design of subsequent generations, enabling progressive improvements in
robustness and efficiency. Digital Twin (DT) technology further strengthens
this paradigm by creating virtual representations that evolve over the
lifecycle through real-time sensing, model updating, and adaptive
re-optimization. This paper presents a DT-enabled CCD framework that integrates
Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to jointly optimize physical design and
controller. DRL accelerates real-time decision-making by allowing controllers
to continuously learn from data and adapt to uncertain environments. Extending
this approach, the framework employs a multi-generation paradigm, where each
cycle of deployment, operation, and redesign uses collected data to refine DT
models, improve uncertainty quantification through quantile regression, and
inform next-generation designs of both physical components and controllers. The
framework is demonstrated on an active suspension system, where DT-enabled
learning from road conditions and driving behaviors yields smoother and more
stable control trajectories. Results show that the method significantly
enhances dynamic performance, robustness, and efficiency. Contributions of this
work include: (1) extending CCD into a lifecycle-oriented multi-generation
framework, (2) leveraging DTs for continuous model updating and informed
design, and (3) employing DRL to accelerate adaptive real-time decision-making.

Abstract: Accurate modeling of inter-stock relationships is critical for stock price
forecasting. However, existing methods predominantly focus on single-state
relationships, neglecting the essential complementarity between dynamic and
static inter-stock relations. To solve this problem, we propose a Dual Relation
Fusion Network (DRFN) to capture the long-term relative stability of stock
relation structures while retaining the flexibility to respond to sudden market
shifts. Our approach features a novel relative static relation component that
models time-varying long-term patterns and incorporates overnight informational
influences. We capture dynamic inter-stock relationships through distance-aware
mechanisms, while evolving long-term structures via recurrent fusion of dynamic
relations from the prior day with the pre-defined static relations. Experiments
demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the baselines across
different markets, with high sensitivity to the co-movement of relational
strength and stock price.

Abstract: Accurate climate forecasting is vital for Bangladesh, a region highly
susceptible to climate change impacts on temperature and rainfall. Existing
models often struggle to capture long-range dependencies and complex temporal
patterns in climate data. This study introduces an advanced Long Short-Term
Memory (LSTM) model integrated with an attention mechanism to enhance the
prediction of temperature and rainfall dynamics. Utilizing comprehensive
datasets from 1901-2023, sourced from NASA's POWER Project for temperature and
the Humanitarian Data Exchange for rainfall, the model effectively captures
seasonal and long-term trends. It outperforms baseline models, including
XGBoost, Simple LSTM, and GRU, achieving a test MSE of 0.2411 (normalized
units), MAE of 0.3860 degrees C, R^2 of 0.9834, and NRMSE of 0.0370 for
temperature, and MSE of 1283.67 mm^2, MAE of 22.91 mm, R^2 of 0.9639, and NRMSE
of 0.0354 for rainfall on monthly forecasts. The model demonstrates improved
robustness with only a 20 percent increase in MSE under simulated climate
trends (compared to an approximately 2.2-fold increase in baseline models
without trend features) and a 50 percent degradation under regional variations
(compared to an approximately 4.8-fold increase in baseline models without
enhancements). These results highlight the model's ability to improve
forecasting precision and offer potential insights into the physical processes
governing climate variability in Bangladesh, supporting applications in
climate-sensitive sectors.

Abstract: The generation of trees with a specified tree edit distance has significant
applications across various fields, including computational biology, structured
data analysis, and image processing. Recently, generative networks have been
increasingly employed to synthesize new data that closely resembles the
original datasets. However, the appropriate size and depth of generative
networks required to generate data with a specified tree edit distance remain
unclear. In this paper, we theoretically establish the existence and
construction of generative networks capable of producing trees similar to a
given tree with respect to the tree edit distance. Specifically, for a given
rooted, ordered, and vertex-labeled tree T of size n + 1 with labels from an
alphabet \Sigma, and a non-negative integer d, we prove that all rooted,
ordered, and vertex-labeled trees over \Sigma with tree edit distance at most d
from T can be generated using a ReLU-based generative network with size O(n^3 )
and constant depth. The proposed networks were implemented and evaluated for
generating trees with up to 21 nodes. Due to their deterministic architecture,
the networks successfully generated all valid trees within the specified tree
edit distance. In contrast, state-of-the-art graph generative models GraphRNN
and GraphGDP, which rely on non-deterministic mechanisms, produced
significantly fewer valid trees, achieving validation rates of only up to 35%
and 48%, respectively. These findings provide a theoretical foundation towards
construction of compact generative models and open new directions for exact and
valid tree-structured data generation. An implementation of the proposed
networks is available at https://github.com/MGANN-KU/TreeGen_ReLUNetworks.

Motivation: 为非线性上下文赌博机问题提供一个统一的随机探索算法框架，解决现有方法在非线性模型中的挑战。

Method: 通过最大似然估计在随机扰动数据上维护多个奖励模型参数估计器，开发了GLM-ES和Neural-ES两种集成采样方法。

Result: 证明了GLM-ES的遗憾界为O(d³/²√T + d⁹/²)，Neural-ES的遗憾界为O(˜d√T)，与最先进的随机探索算法结果相匹配。

Conclusion: 集成采样被证明是非线性上下文赌博机问题中一种可证明且实用的随机探索方法。

Abstract: We provide a unified algorithmic framework for ensemble sampling in nonlinear
contextual bandits and develop corresponding regret bounds for two most common
nonlinear contextual bandit settings: Generalized Linear Ensemble Sampling
(\texttt{GLM-ES}) for generalized linear bandits and Neural Ensemble Sampling
(\texttt{Neural-ES}) for neural contextual bandits. Both methods maintain
multiple estimators for the reward model parameters via maximum likelihood
estimation on randomly perturbed data. We prove high-probability frequentist
regret bounds of $\mathcal{O}(d^{3/2} \sqrt{T} + d^{9/2})$ for \texttt{GLM-ES}
and $\mathcal{O}(\widetilde{d} \sqrt{T})$ for \texttt{Neural-ES}, where $d$ is
the dimension of feature vectors, $\widetilde{d}$ is the effective dimension of
a neural tangent kernel matrix, and $T$ is the number of rounds. These regret
bounds match the state-of-the-art results of randomized exploration algorithms
in nonlinear contextual bandit settings. In the theoretical analysis, we
introduce techniques that address challenges specific to nonlinear models.
Practically, we remove fixed-time horizon assumptions by developing anytime
versions of our algorithms, suitable when $T$ is unknown. Finally, we
empirically evaluate \texttt{GLM-ES}, \texttt{Neural-ES}, and their anytime
variants, demonstrating strong performance. Overall, our results establish
ensemble sampling as a provable and practical randomized exploration approach
for nonlinear contextual bandits.

and predictive accuracy achieving R2 = 0.74 for balanced approaches. This work
proposes the feasibility of dynamical systems analysis for multi-objective LLM
interactions, with code generation serving as an initial validation domain.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Optimally Deep Networks (ODNs)方法，通过渐进式深度扩展训练策略，为不同复杂度的数据集自动选择最优网络深度，显著减少模型大小和计算资源消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络通常以完整深度训练，但对于低复杂度数据集会造成计算资源浪费、能耗过高和内存占用过大，难以在资源受限设备上部署。

Method: 采用类似NAS的训练策略——渐进式深度扩展，从较浅深度开始训练，在早期模块收敛后逐步增加网络深度，直到达到目标精度，只保留最优深度。

Result: 在MNIST和SVHN数据集上，ResNet-18和ResNet-34的最优深度分别实现了98.64%和96.44%的内存占用减少，同时保持99.31%和96.08%的竞争性准确率。

Conclusion: ODNs方法能够根据数据集复杂度自动选择最优网络深度，显著降低训练和推理成本，提高计算效率，便于在边缘设备上部署。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have provided brilliant performance across
various tasks. However, this success often comes at the cost of unnecessarily
large model sizes, high computational demands, and substantial memory
footprints. Typically, powerful architectures are trained at full depths but
not all datasets or tasks require such high model capacity. Training very deep
architectures on relatively low-complexity datasets frequently leads to wasted
computation, unnecessary energy consumption, and excessive memory usage, which
in turn makes deployment of models on resource-constrained devices impractical.
To address this problem, we introduce Optimally Deep Networks (ODNs), which
provide a balance between model depth and task complexity. Specifically, we
propose a NAS like training strategy called progressive depth expansion, which
begins by training deep networks at shallower depths and incrementally
increases their depth as the earlier blocks converge, continuing this process
until the target accuracy is reached. ODNs use only the optimal depth for the
given datasets, removing redundant layers. This cuts down future training and
inference costs, lowers the memory footprint, enhances computational
efficiency, and facilitates deployment on edge devices. Empirical results show
that the optimal depths of ResNet-18 and ResNet-34 for MNIST and SVHN, achieve
up to 98.64 % and 96.44 % reduction in memory footprint, while maintaining a
competitive accuracy of 99.31 % and 96.08 %, respectively.

TL;DR: 本文分析了RLHF微调扩散模型时训练与推理采样器不匹配导致的奖励差距问题，提供了理论边界证明和实证验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决扩散模型在RLHF微调中存在的关键挑战：训练时使用随机SDE采样器鼓励探索，而推理时使用确定性ODE采样器追求效率，这种不匹配会导致奖励差距，影响推理时的输出质量。

Method: 采用广义去噪扩散隐式模型(gDDIM)框架支持任意高水平的随机性，保持数据边缘分布；通过理论分析表征奖励差距并提供非空边界；在文本到图像模型上进行大规模实验验证。

Result: 理论分析为一般扩散模型提供了非空边界，为VE和VP高斯模型提供了更尖锐的收敛率；实证结果表明奖励差距在训练过程中持续缩小，当使用更高随机性的SDE训练更新模型时，ODE采样质量得到改善。

Conclusion: 训练与推理采样器不匹配导致的奖励差距问题可以通过理论分析和适当的方法得到有效解决，使用更高随机性的训练策略可以改善推理时的确定性采样质量。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is increasingly used to
fine-tune diffusion models, but a key challenge arises from the mismatch
between stochastic samplers used during training and deterministic samplers
used during inference. In practice, models are fine-tuned using stochastic SDE
samplers to encourage exploration, while inference typically relies on
deterministic ODE samplers for efficiency and stability. This discrepancy
induces a reward gap, raising concerns about whether high-quality outputs can
be expected during inference. In this paper, we theoretically characterize this
reward gap and provide non-vacuous bounds for general diffusion models, along
with sharper convergence rates for Variance Exploding (VE) and Variance
Preserving (VP) Gaussian models. Methodologically, we adopt the generalized
denoising diffusion implicit models (gDDIM) framework to support arbitrarily
high levels of stochasticity, preserving data marginals throughout.
Empirically, our findings through large-scale experiments on text-to-image
models using denoising diffusion policy optimization (DDPO) and mixed group
relative policy optimization (MixGRPO) validate that reward gaps consistently
narrow over training, and ODE sampling quality improves when models are updated
using higher-stochasticity SDE training.

Conclusion: OmniGNN通过创新的行业节点设计和多关系建模，有效解决了宏观经济冲击下的消息传播问题，提升了股票预测的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: In financial markets, Graph Neural Networks have been successfully applied to
modeling relational data, effectively capturing nonlinear inter-stock
dependencies. Yet, existing models often fail to efficiently propagate messages
during macroeconomic shocks. In this paper, we propose OmniGNN, an
attention-based multi-relational dynamic GNN that integrates macroeconomic
context via heterogeneous node and edge types for robust message passing.
Central to OmniGNN is a sector node acting as a global intermediary, enabling
rapid shock propagation across the graph without relying on long-range
multi-hop diffusion. The model leverages Graph Attention Networks (GAT) to
weigh neighbor contributions and employs Transformers to capture temporal
dynamics across multiplex relations. Experiments show that OmniGNN outperforms
existing stock prediction models on public datasets, particularly demonstrating
strong robustness during the COVID-19 period.

Conclusion: 该框架为深度学习优化提供了统一视角，新方法在性能和适用性方面展现出优势。

Abstract: Optimization lies at the core of modern deep learning, yet existing methods
often face a fundamental trade-off between adapting to problem geometry and
leveraging curvature utilization. Steepest descent algorithms adapt to
different geometries through norm choices but remain strictly first-order,
whereas quasi-Newton and adaptive optimizers incorporate curvature information
but are restricted to Frobenius geometry, limiting their applicability across
diverse architectures. In this work, we propose a unified framework
generalizing steepest descent, quasi-Newton methods, and adaptive methods
through the novel notion of preconditioned matrix norms. This abstraction
reveals that widely used optimizers such as SGD and Adam, as well as more
advanced approaches like Muon and KL-Shampoo, and recent hybrids including SOAP
and SPlus, all emerge as special cases of the same principle. Within this
framework, we provide the first systematic treatment of affine and scale
invariance in the matrix-parameterized setting, establishing necessary and
sufficient conditions under generalized norms. Building on this foundation, we
introduce two new methods, $\texttt{MuAdam}$ and $\texttt{MuAdam-SANIA}$, which
combine the spectral geometry of Muon with Adam-style preconditioning. Our
experiments demonstrate that these optimizers are competitive with, and in some
cases outperform, existing state-of-the-art methods. Our code is available at

Conclusion: BioOSS成功模拟了生物神经系统中关键的波状传播动态，为更接近生物神经处理的深度学习架构提供了新方向。

Abstract: Today's deep learning architectures are primarily based on perceptron models,
which do not capture the oscillatory dynamics characteristic of biological
neurons. Although oscillatory systems have recently gained attention for their
closer resemblance to neural behavior, they still fall short of modeling the
intricate spatio-temporal interactions observed in natural neural circuits. In
this paper, we propose a bio-inspired oscillatory state system (BioOSS)
designed to emulate the wave-like propagation dynamics critical to neural
processing, particularly in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), where complex activity
patterns emerge. BioOSS comprises two interacting populations of neurons: p
neurons, which represent simplified membrane-potential-like units inspired by
pyramidal cells in cortical columns, and o neurons, which govern propagation
velocities and modulate the lateral spread of activity. Through local
interactions, these neurons produce wave-like propagation patterns. The model
incorporates trainable parameters for damping and propagation speed, enabling
flexible adaptation to task-specific spatio-temporal structures. We evaluate
BioOSS on both synthetic and real-world tasks, demonstrating superior
performance and enhanced interpretability compared to alternative
architectures.

Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
models and Transformers have been widely adopted in hydrological applications,
demonstrating impressive performance amongst deep learning models and
outperforming physical models in various tasks. However, their superiority in
predicting land surface states such as terrestrial water storage (TWS) that are
dominated by many factors such as natural variability and human driven
modifications remains unclear. Here, using the open-access, globally
representative HydroGlobe dataset - comprising a baseline version derived
solely from a land surface model simulation and an advanced version
incorporating multi-source remote sensing data assimilation - we show that
linear regression is a robust benchmark, outperforming the more complex LSTM
and Temporal Fusion Transformer for TWS prediction. Our findings highlight the
importance of including traditional statistical models as benchmarks when
developing and evaluating deep learning models. Additionally, we emphasize the
critical need to establish globally representative benchmark datasets that
capture the combined impact of natural variability and human interventions.

Conclusion: 剪枝作为开发能够简化时空问题模型的有力工具，能够获取问题的最重要元素

Abstract: This work addresses the challenge of using a deep learning model to prune
graphs and the ability of this method to integrate explainability into
spatio-temporal problems through a new approach. Instead of applying
explainability to the model's behavior, we seek to gain a better understanding
of the problem itself. To this end, we propose a novel model that integrates an
optimized pruning mechanism capable of removing nodes from the graph during the
training process, rather than doing so as a separate procedure. This
integration allows the architecture to learn how to minimize prediction error
while selecting the most relevant nodes. Thus, during training, the model
searches for the most relevant subset of nodes, obtaining the most important
elements of the problem, facilitating its analysis. To evaluate the proposed
approach, we used several widely used traffic datasets, comparing the accuracy
obtained by pruning with the model and with other methods. The experiments
demonstrate that our method is capable of retaining a greater amount of
information as the graph reduces in size compared to the other methods used.
These results highlight the potential of pruning as a tool for developing
models capable of simplifying spatio-temporal problems, thereby obtaining their
most important elements.

Motivation: 研究在制度转换环境下，如何通过制度条件的生成情景和凸CVaR分配器来改善投资组合决策，特别是在危机时期更好地捕捉资产间的联动关系。

Method: 1. 使用高斯HMM推断潜在制度；2. 训练具有尾部加权目标和制度专业化混合专家去噪器的扩散模型；3. 将生成情景输入考虑换手率的CVaR二次规划优化器。

Result: 在2005-2025年回测中，MARCD获得夏普比率1.23（基准1.02），最大回撤9.3%（基准14.1%），换手率相当，夏普提升在5%水平显著。

Conclusion: MARCD提供了一个从尾部忠实情景建模到受治理投资组合决策的可复现桥梁，显著改善了回撤控制。

Abstract: We study whether regime-conditioned generative scenarios, coupled with a
convex CVaR allocator, improve portfolio decisions under regime shifts. We
introduce Multi-Agent Regime-Conditioned Diffusion (MARCD), which (i) infers
latent regimes via a Gaussian HMM, (ii) trains a diffusion model with a
tail-weighted objective and a regime-specialized mixture-of-experts (MoE)
denoiser to enrich crisis co-movements, and (iii) feeds the generated scenarios
into a turnover-aware CVaR epigraph quadratic program with explicit governance.
In strict walk-forward tests on liquid multi-asset ETFs (2005-2025), MARCD
outperforms standard allocators and improves calibration relative to popular
generators. Over 2020-2025 out-of-sample (monthly; 10 bps), MARCD attains
Sharpe 1.23 (BL 1.02) and MaxDD 9.3 percent (BL 14.1 percent), a 34 percent
reduction, at comparable turnover; stationary block-bootstrap intervals
indicate the Sharpe uplift is significant at 5 percent. We provide theory
linking tail-weighted diffusion to spectral-risk control of the
decision-relevant CVaR gap, oracle/consistency results for the regime-MoE
denoiser, and Lipschitz/regret guarantees for the allocator. Together, MARCD
offers a reproducible bridge from tail-faithful scenario modeling to governed
portfolio decisions with materially improved drawdown control.

Conclusion: AEGIS框架能够高效识别最优掩码配置，在保护隐私的同时保持数据效用，适用于原始数据因隐私限制而无法访问的场景。

Abstract: Data-sharing ecosystems enable entities -- such as providers, consumers, and
intermediaries -- to access, exchange, and utilize data for various downstream
tasks and applications. Due to privacy concerns, data providers typically
anonymize datasets before sharing them; however, the existence of multiple
masking configurations results in masked datasets with varying utility.
Consequently, a key challenge lies in efficiently determining the optimal
masking configuration that maximizes a dataset's utility. This paper presents
AEGIS, a middleware framework for identifying the optimal masking configuration
for machine learning datasets that consist of features and a class label. We
introduce a utility optimizer that minimizes predictive utility deviation -- a
metric based on the changes in feature-label correlations before and after
masking. Our framework leverages limited data summaries (such as 1D histograms)
or none to estimate the feature-label joint distribution, making it suitable
for scenarios where raw data is inaccessible due to privacy restrictions. To
achieve this, we propose a joint distribution estimator based on iterative
proportional fitting, which allows supporting various feature-label correlation
quantification methods such as g3, mutual information, or chi-square. Our
experimental evaluation on real-world datasets shows that AEGIS identifies
optimal masking configurations over an order of magnitude faster, while the
resulting masked datasets achieve predictive performance on downstream ML tasks
that is on par with baseline approaches.

Motivation: 现有LLM-GNN融合策略对所有节点统一应用，整体性能提升有限。作者认为这是因为聚合指标掩盖了LLM的实际价值，需要围绕GNN容易失败的节点重新设计融合策略。

Method: 提出GLANCE框架：1) 分析GNN和LLM在不同结构模式下的性能差异；2) 使用轻量级路由器基于廉价节点信号决定是否调用LLM；3) 采用基于优势的目标函数训练路由器，比较调用LLM与仅依赖GNN的效用。

Conclusion: 自适应、节点感知的GNN-LLM架构具有重要价值，选择性调用LLM可以在大规模图上实现可扩展部署，避免高昂计算成本。

Abstract: Learning on text-attributed graphs has motivated the use of Large Language
Models (LLMs) for graph learning. However, most fusion strategies are applied
uniformly across all nodes and attain only small overall performance gains. We
argue this result stems from aggregate metrics that obscure when LLMs provide
benefit, inhibiting actionable signals for new strategies. In this work, we
reframe LLM-GNN fusion around nodes where GNNs typically falter. We first show
that performance can significantly differ between GNNs and LLMs, with each
excelling on distinct structural patterns, such as local homophily. To leverage
this finding, we propose GLANCE (GNN with LLM Assistance for Neighbor- and
Context-aware Embeddings), a framework that invokes an LLM to refine a GNN's
prediction. GLANCE employs a lightweight router that, given inexpensive
per-node signals, decides whether to query the LLM. Since the LLM calls are
non-differentiable, the router is trained with an advantage-based objective
that compares the utility of querying the LLM against relying solely on the
GNN. Across multiple benchmarks, GLANCE achieves the best performance balance
across node subgroups, achieving significant gains on heterophilous nodes (up
to $+13\%$) while simultaneously achieving top overall performance. Our
findings highlight the value of adaptive, node-aware GNN-LLM architectures,
where selectively invoking the LLM enables scalable deployment on large graphs
without incurring high computational costs.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable performance in generating
high-dimensional samples across domains such as vision, language, and the
sciences. Although continuous-state diffusion models have been extensively
studied both empirically and theoretically, discrete-state diffusion models,
essential for applications involving text, sequences, and combinatorial
structures, remain significantly less understood from a theoretical standpoint.
In particular, all existing analyses of discrete-state models assume score
estimation error bounds without studying sample complexity results. In this
work, we present a principled theoretical framework for discrete-state
diffusion, providing the first sample complexity bound of
$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-2})$. Our structured decomposition of the
score estimation error into statistical, approximation, optimization, and
clipping components offers critical insights into how discrete-state models can
be trained efficiently. This analysis addresses a fundamental gap in the
literature and establishes the theoretical tractability and practical relevance
of discrete-state diffusion models.

Abstract: Several learned policies have been proposed to replace heuristics for
scheduling, caching, and other system components in modern systems. By
leveraging diverse features, learning from historical trends, and predicting
future behaviors, such models promise to keep pace with ever-increasing
workload dynamism and continuous hardware evolution. However, policies trained
in isolation may still achieve suboptimal performance when placed together. In
this paper, we inspect one such instance in the domain of hardware caching --
for the policies of cache replacement and prefetching. We argue that these two
policies are bidirectionally interdependent and make the case for training the
two jointly. We propose a joint learning approach based on developing shared
representations for the features used by the two policies. We present two
approaches to develop these shared representations, one based on a joint
encoder and another based on contrastive learning of the embeddings, and
demonstrate promising preliminary results for both of these. Finally, we lay
down an agenda for future research in this direction.

Conclusion: 图异配性与GNN性能之间的关系不是严格的单调相关，需要自适应图滤波器来保证良好的泛化性能。

Abstract: Graph heterophily, where connected nodes have different labels, has attracted
significant interest recently. Most existing works adopt a simplified approach
- using low-pass filters for homophilic graphs and high-pass filters for
heterophilic graphs. However, we discover that the relationship between graph
heterophily and spectral filters is more complex - the optimal filter response
varies across frequency components and does not follow a strict monotonic
correlation with heterophily degree. This finding challenges conventional fixed
filter designs and suggests the need for adaptive filtering to preserve
expressiveness in graph embeddings. Formally, natural questions arise: Given a
heterophilic graph G, how and to what extent will the varying heterophily
degree of G affect the performance of GNNs? How can we design adaptive filters
to fit those varying heterophilic connections? Our theoretical analysis reveals
that the average frequency response of GNNs and graph heterophily degree do not
follow a strict monotonic correlation, necessitating adaptive graph filters to
guarantee good generalization performance. Hence, we propose [METHOD NAME], a
simple yet powerful GNN, which extracts information across the heterophily
spectrum and combines salient representations through adaptive mixing. [METHOD
NAME]'s superior performance achieves up to 9.2% accuracy improvement over
leading baselines across homophilic and heterophilic graphs.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于梯度唯一性的隐私泄露度量方法，用于评估发布机器学习模型时的隐私风险，该方法无需对模型架构、数据类型或攻击策略做假设。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发布机器学习模型时存在隐私泄露风险，但现有方法缺乏直观的隐私度量指标来准确评估这种风险程度。

Method: 提出梯度唯一性作为隐私泄露度量指标，该指标基于发布学习模型时信息泄露的上界推导而来，并提供了一种基于监控梯度唯一性的简单防御方法。

Result: 与经典方法如DP-SGD相比，基于梯度唯一性的防御方法在隐私保护效果相当的情况下，测试准确率显著更高。

Conclusion: 梯度唯一性提供了一个直观且通用的隐私审计方法，在保持良好隐私保护的同时显著提升了模型效用。

Abstract: Disclosing private information via publication of a machine learning model is
often a concern. Intuitively, publishing a learned model should be less risky
than publishing a dataset. But how much risk is there? In this paper, we
present a principled disclosure metric called \emph{gradient uniqueness} that
is derived from an upper bound on the amount of information disclosure from
publishing a learned model. Gradient uniqueness provides an intuitive way to
perform privacy auditing. The mathematical derivation of gradient uniqueness is
general, and does not make any assumption on the model architecture, dataset
type, or the strategy of an attacker. We examine a simple defense based on
monitoring gradient uniqueness, and find that it achieves privacy comparable to
classical methods such as DP-SGD, while being substantially better in terms of
(utility) testing accuracy.

Result: 在四个公共数据集上的实验表明，该方法优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 将长期时间和频率表示与自适应融合相结合，为时间序列异常检测提供了稳健高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection(TSAD) is a critical task in signal processing
field, ensuring the reliability of complex systems. Reconstruction-based
methods dominate in TSAD. Among these methods, VAE-based methods have achieved
promising results. Existing VAE-based methods suffer from the limitation of
single-window feature and insufficient leveraging of long-term time and
frequency information. We propose a Conditional Variational AutoEncoder with
Long-term dependency and Probabilistic time-frequency fusion, named LPCVAE.
LPCVAE introduces LSTM to capture long-term dependencies beyond windows. It
further incorporates a Product-of-Experts (PoE) mechanism for adaptive and
distribution-level probabilistic fusion. This design effectively mitigates
time-frequency information loss. Extensive experiments on four public datasets
demonstrate it outperforms state-of-the-art methods. The results confirm that
integrating long-term time and frequency representations with adaptive fusion
yields a robust and efficient solution for TSAD.

Motivation: 现有研究表明，更强的模型并不总是最优的教师，存在教师输出与学生可学习性之间的不匹配问题。

Method: PerSyn采用"路由后生成"范式：首先通过查询级路由器为每个提示分配最优教师，综合考虑学生可学习性和教师响应质量；然后每个教师仅为其分配的提示生成数据。

Conclusion: PerSyn通过个性化数据合成有效提升了学生模型的学习效果，验证了该方法的有效性并为未来研究提供了额外见解。

Abstract: Training student models on synthetic data generated by strong teacher models
is a promising way to distilling the capabilities of teachers. However, recent
studies show that stronger models are not always optimal teachers, revealing a
mismatch between teacher outputs and student learnability. To address this
issue, we propose PerSyn (Personalized data Synthesis), a novel synthesis
strategy that operates under a new ``Route then Generate'' paradigm to create
data tailored to each student model, enabling it to learn more effectively.
Specifically, PerSyn first assigns each prompt to its optimal teacher via a
query-level router that jointly considers student learnability and teacher
response quality. Each teacher then synthesizes data only for its assigned
prompts, making the process more efficient than the conventional ``Generate
then Select'' paradigm, where all teachers must generate parallel responses for
the entire prompt set before constructing the final dataset. Extensive
experiments across different model families and scales demonstrate that PerSyn
consistently achieves superior or comparable performance to all baselines in
instruct tuning and math reasoning settings. Further analysis verifies the
effectiveness of PerSyn and offers extra insights to propel future research.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has been an important machine learning paradigm
for solving long-horizon sequential decision-making problems under uncertainty.
By integrating deep neural networks (DNNs) into the RL framework, deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) has emerged, which achieved significant success in
various domains. However, the integration of DNNs also makes it vulnerable to
adversarial attacks. Existing adversarial attack techniques mainly focus on
either directly manipulating the environment with which a victim agent
interacts or deploying an adversarial agent that interacts with the victim
agent to induce abnormal behaviors. While these techniques achieve promising
results, their adoption in multi-party open systems remains limited due to two
major reasons: impractical assumption of full control over the environment and
dependent on interactions with victim agents.
  To enable adversarial attacks in multi-party open systems, in this paper, we
redesigned an adversarial policy learning approach that can mislead
well-trained victim agents without requiring direct interactions with these
agents or full control over their environments. Particularly, we propose a
neutral agent-based approach across various task scenarios in multi-party open
systems. While the neutral agents seemingly are detached from the victim
agents, indirectly influence them through the shared environment. We evaluate
our proposed method on the SMAC platform based on Starcraft II and the
autonomous driving simulation platform Highway-env. The experimental results
demonstrate that our method can launch general and effective adversarial
attacks in multi-party open systems.

TL;DR: 提出了一个理论框架，将经典信息论扩展到有限结构化系统，将冗余重新定义为信息组织的基本属性而非低效性。该框架通过信息散度统一了多种经典度量，揭示了冗余的几何原理，并预测了冗余存在上下界，形成平衡压缩与耦合的最优均衡点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统通信理论强调最小化冗余以实现传输效率，但现实世界中的有限结构化系统（如学习系统）需要冗余来维持稳定性和泛化能力。本文旨在建立连接通信理论与学习理论的统一冗余理论。

Method: 构建理论框架，将冗余重新定义为信息散度家族，统一了互信息、卡方依赖性和谱冗余等经典度量。通过几何原理揭示这些度量的内在联系，并理论推导冗余的上下界。

Result: 理论预测冗余存在最优均衡点，实验验证了掩码自编码器在该均衡点附近达到最佳泛化性能。冗余被证明是可测量和可调节的量，连接了通信的渐近世界和学习的有限世界。

Conclusion: 冗余是信息组织的基本属性，在有限结构化系统中起着关键作用。最优冗余平衡了过度压缩和过度耦合，为理解学习系统的稳定性和泛化能力提供了新视角。

Abstract: We present a theoretical framework that extends classical information theory
to finite and structured systems by redefining redundancy as a fundamental
property of information organization rather than inefficiency. In this
framework, redundancy is expressed as a general family of informational
divergences that unifies multiple classical measures, such as mutual
information, chi-squared dependence, and spectral redundancy, under a single
geometric principle. This reveals that these traditional quantities are not
isolated heuristics but projections of a shared redundancy geometry. The theory
further predicts that redundancy is bounded both above and below, giving rise
to an optimal equilibrium that balances over-compression (loss of structure)
and over-coupling (collapse). While classical communication theory favors
minimal redundancy for transmission efficiency, finite and structured systems,
such as those underlying real-world learning, achieve maximal stability and
generalization near this equilibrium. Experiments with masked autoencoders are
used to illustrate and verify this principle: the model exhibits a stable
redundancy level where generalization peaks. Together, these results establish
redundancy as a measurable and tunable quantity that bridges the asymptotic
world of communication and the finite world of learning.

Abstract: Early detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is crucial because its
neurodegenerative effects are irreversible, and neuropathologic and
social-behavioral risk factors accumulate years before diagnosis. Identifying
higher-risk individuals earlier enables prevention, timely care, and equitable
resource allocation. We predict cognitive performance from social determinants
of health (SDOH) using the NIH NIA-supported PREPARE Challenge Phase 2 dataset
derived from the nationally representative Mex-Cog cohort of the 2003 and 2012
Mexican Health and Aging Study (MHAS).
  Data: The target is a validated composite cognitive score across seven
domains-orientation, memory, attention, language, constructional praxis, and
executive function-derived from the 2016 and 2021 MHAS waves. Predictors span
demographic, socioeconomic, health, lifestyle, psychosocial, and healthcare
access factors.
  Methodology: Missingness was addressed with a singular value decomposition
(SVD)-based imputation pipeline treating continuous and categorical variables
separately. This approach leverages latent feature correlations to recover
missing values while balancing reliability and scalability. After evaluating
multiple methods, XGBoost was chosen for its superior predictive performance.
  Results and Discussion: The framework outperformed existing methods and the
data challenge leaderboard, demonstrating high accuracy, robustness, and
interpretability. SHAP-based post hoc analysis identified top contributing SDOH
factors and age-specific feature patterns. Notably, flooring material emerged
as a strong predictor, reflecting socioeconomic and environmental disparities.
Other influential factors, age, SES, lifestyle, social interaction, sleep,
stress, and BMI, underscore the multifactorial nature of cognitive aging and
the value of interpretable, data-driven SDOH modeling.

Motivation: RLVR训练中常出现策略熵崩溃问题，导致策略过于确定性化，阻碍探索并限制推理性能。传统的固定系数熵正则化方法效果不稳定，难以适应不同任务和模型的需求。

Method: 提出自适应熵正则化(AER)框架，包含三个组件：难度感知系数分配、初始锚定目标熵和动态全局系数调整，动态平衡探索与利用。

Result: 在多个数学推理基准测试中，AER始终优于基线方法，显著提高了推理准确性和探索能力。

Conclusion: 自适应熵正则化框架有效解决了RLVR训练中的策略熵崩溃问题，证明了动态调整熵正则化系数的重要性，为提升大语言模型的推理能力提供了有效方法。

Abstract: Reasoning ability has become a defining capability of Large Language Models
(LLMs), with Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) emerging as
a key paradigm to enhance it. However, RLVR training often suffers from policy
entropy collapse, where the policy becomes overly deterministic, hindering
exploration and limiting reasoning performance. While entropy regularization is
a common remedy, its effectiveness is highly sensitive to the fixed
coefficient, making it unstable across tasks and models. In this work, we
revisit entropy regularization in RLVR and argue that its potential has been
largely underestimated. Our analysis shows that (i) tasks of varying difficulty
demand distinct exploration intensities, and (ii) balanced exploration may
require the policy entropy to be maintained within a moderate range below its
initial level. Therefore, we propose Adaptive Entropy Regularization (AER)--a
framework that dynamically balances exploration and exploitation via three
components: difficulty-aware coefficient allocation, initial-anchored target
entropy, and dynamic global coefficient adjustment. Experiments on multiple
mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that AER consistently outperforms
baselines, improving both reasoning accuracy and exploration capability.

TL;DR: MC#是一个结合静态量化和动态专家剪枝的框架，用于压缩MoE-LLMs/VLMs模型，通过预加载混合精度量化和在线任意剪枝技术，在保持性能的同时显著减少存储和计算开销。


<details>

Motivation: MoE模型通过稀疏激活扩展模型容量，但预加载所有专家和激活多个专家会带来显著的计算和内存开销，专家模块成为模型大小和推理成本的主要贡献者。

Method: 提出PMQ（预加载混合精度量化）通过线性规划优化比特分配，平衡专家重要性和量化误差；OTP（在线任意剪枝）使用Gumbel-Softmax采样动态选择专家子集，实现细粒度激活控制。

Result: 在DeepSeek-VL2上，MC#实现了6.2倍的权重压缩，平均2.57比特，在五个多模态基准测试中仅损失1.7%的准确率；OTP减少专家激活超过20%，性能下降小于1%。

Conclusion: MC#通过结合PMQ的静态比特宽度优化和OTP的动态路由，实现了极端压缩且精度损失最小，展示了高效部署MoE模型的强大潜力。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) effectively scales large language models (LLMs) and
vision-language models (VLMs) by increasing capacity through sparse activation.
However, preloading all experts into memory and activating multiple experts per
input introduces significant computational and memory overhead, making the
expert module a major contributor to model size and inference cost. To address
this, we propose MC# (Mixture-Compressor-sharp), a framework that combines
static quantization and dynamic expert pruning by leveraging the significance
of experts and tokens for aggressive compression of MoE-LLMs/VLMs. To reduce
storage and loading costs, we introduce Pre-Loading Mixed-Precision
Quantization (PMQ), which optimizes bit allocation via linear programming,
balancing expert importance and quantization error for a Pareto-optimal
trade-off between size and performance. To reduce runtime computation, Online
Top-any Pruning (OTP) uses Gumbel-Softmax sampling to dynamically select a
subset of experts per token, enabling fine-grained control over activation. By
combining PMQ's static bit-width optimization with OTP's dynamic routing, MC#
achieves extreme compression with minimal accuracy loss. On DeepSeek-VL2, MC#
achieves a 6.2 times weight reduction at 2.57 average bits with only a 1.7%
accuracy drop across five multimodal benchmarks. Additionally, OTP reduces
expert activation over 20% with less than 1% performance degradation,
demonstrating strong potential for efficient MoE-based model deployment.

Abstract: The reward model (RM) plays a crucial role in aligning Large Language Models
(LLMs) with human preferences through Reinforcement Learning, where the
Bradley-Terry (BT) objective has been recognized as simple yet powerful,
specifically for pairwise preference learning. However, BT-based RMs often
struggle to effectively distinguish between similar preference responses,
leading to insufficient separation between preferred and non-preferred outputs.
Consequently, they may easily overfit easy samples and cannot generalize well
to Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) samples, resulting in suboptimal performance. To
address these challenges, this paper introduces an effective enhancement to
BT-based RMs through an adaptive margin mechanism. Specifically, we design to
dynamically adjust the RM focus on more challenging samples through margins,
based on both semantic similarity and model-predicted reward differences, which
is approached from a distributional perspective solvable with Optimal Transport
(OT). By incorporating these factors into a principled OT cost matrix design,
our adaptive margin enables the RM to better capture distributional differences
between chosen and rejected responses, yielding significant improvements in
performance, convergence speed, and generalization capabilities. Experimental
results across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms
several existing RM techniques, showcasing enhanced performance in both
In-Distribution (ID) and OOD settings. Moreover, RLHF experiments support our
practical effectiveness in better aligning LLMs with human preferences. Our

Method: 在AIME25和GPQA-Diamond数据集上进行1700个推理场景的系统实验，分析不同规模模型的内存分配权衡。

Result: 发现8B参数是临界点：低于此规模的模型通过分配更多内存给权重获得更好精度，而更大模型通过分配内存给更长生成获得更好精度。

Conclusion: 推理模型的内存优化不能规模无关，小型模型应优先模型容量，大型模型应优先测试时计算，这与非推理模型的策略根本不同。

Abstract: While 4-bit quantization has emerged as a memory-optimal choice for
non-reasoning models and zero-shot tasks across scales, we show that this
universal prescription fails for reasoning models, where the KV cache rather
than model size can dominate memory. Through systematic experiments across
1,700 inference scenarios on AIME25 and GPQA-Diamond, we find a scale-dependent
trade-off: models with an effective size below 8-bit 4B parameters achieve
better accuracy by allocating memory to more weights rather than longer
generation, while larger models achieve better accuracy by allocating memory to
longer generations. This scale threshold also determines when parallel scaling
becomes memory-efficient and whether KV cache eviction outperforms KV
quantization. Our findings show that memory optimization for LLMs cannot be
scale-agnostic, while providing principled guidelines: for small reasoning
models, prioritize model capacity over test-time compute, while for larger
ones, maximize test-time compute. Our results suggest that optimizing reasoning
models for deployment requires fundamentally different strategies from those
established for non-reasoning models.

Abstract: Derivative-free Bayesian inversion is an important task in many science and
engineering applications, particularly when computing the forward model
derivative is computationally and practically challenging. In this paper, we
introduce Blade, which can produce accurate and well-calibrated posteriors for
Bayesian inversion using an ensemble of interacting particles. Blade leverages
powerful data-driven priors based on diffusion models, and can handle nonlinear
forward models that permit only black-box access (i.e., derivative-free).
Theoretically, we establish a non-asymptotic convergence analysis to
characterize the effects of forward model and prior estimation errors.
Empirically, Blade achieves superior performance compared to existing
derivative-free Bayesian inversion methods on various inverse problems,
including challenging highly nonlinear fluid dynamics.

Conclusion: 为理解Barlow Twins的有效性提供了严格理论基础，并为分析SSL算法提供了新的几何视角

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has achieved remarkable success by learning
meaningful representations without labeled data. However, a unified theoretical
framework for understanding and comparing the efficiency of different SSL
paradigms remains elusive. In this paper, we introduce a novel
information-geometric framework to quantify representation efficiency. We
define representation efficiency $\eta$ as the ratio between the effective
intrinsic dimension of the learned representation space and its ambient
dimension, where the effective dimension is derived from the spectral
properties of the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) on the statistical manifold
induced by the encoder. Within this framework, we present a theoretical
analysis of the Barlow Twins method. Under specific but natural assumptions, we
prove that Barlow Twins achieves optimal representation efficiency ($\eta = 1$)
by driving the cross-correlation matrix of representations towards the identity
matrix, which in turn induces an isotropic FIM. This work provides a rigorous
theoretical foundation for understanding the effectiveness of Barlow Twins and
offers a new geometric perspective for analyzing SSL algorithms.

Abstract: Recent AI regulations call for data that remain useful for innovation while
resistant to misuse, balancing utility with protection at the model level.
Existing approaches either perturb data to make it unlearnable or retrain
models to suppress transfer, but neither governs inference by unknown models,
and both typically require control over training. We propose non-transferable
examples (NEs), a training-free and data-agnostic input-side usage-control
mechanism. We recode inputs within a model-specific low-sensitivity subspace,
preserving outputs for the authorized model while reducing performance on
unauthorized models through subspace misalignment. We establish formal bounds
that guarantee utility for the authorized model and quantify deviation for
unauthorized ones, with the Hoffman-Wielandt inequality linking degradation to
spectral differences. Empirically, NEs retain performance on diverse vision
backbones and state-of-the-art vision-language models under common
preprocessing, whereas non-target models collapse even with reconstruction
attempts. These results establish NEs as a practical means to preserve intended
data utility while preventing unauthorized exploitation. Our project is

TL;DR: InstructUE是一个基于大语言模型的指令感知用户嵌入基础模型，通过多编码器架构和对比-自回归训练框架，生成通用且指令感知的用户表示，显著提升跨域泛化能力和噪声鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有用户表示建模方法在跨域泛化性和对噪声行为信号的敏感性方面存在不足，需要开发更通用和鲁棒的用户表示学习框架。

Method: 提出多编码器架构处理异构数据，引入对比-自回归训练框架，结合自回归学习捕获语言空间领域知识和对比学习对齐用户-文本嵌入，使用UserQA数据集桥接语言和表示空间。

Result: 在用户预测、营销和推荐等真实场景中，InstructUE显著优于现有方法，能够实现特定场景下的指令引导去噪。

Conclusion: 指令感知用户建模可以有效实现用户信息的指令引导去噪，为更通用和鲁棒的用户表示学习开辟了新途径。

Abstract: User representation modeling has become increasingly crucial for personalized
applications, yet existing approaches struggle with generalizability across
domains and sensitivity to noisy behavioral signals. We present InstructUE, an
instruction-aware user embedding foundation model that leverages large language
models (LLMs) to generate general and instruction-aware user representations.
InstructUE introduces a multi-encoder architecture with a lightweight adapter
that efficiently processes heterogeneous data from six different sources while
preserving their structural characteristics. Additionally, it proposes a novel
contrastive-autoregressive training framework that bridges language and
representation spaces through a curated UserQA dataset. The
contrastive-autoregressive training framework simultaneously leverages
autoregressive learning to capture domain knowledge in language space and
contrastive learning to align user-text embeddings in representation space,
thereby enhancing the instruction-awareness and noise-robustness of user
embeddings. Through extensive experiments on real-world applications, we
demonstrate that InstructUE significantly outperforms existing methods across
multiple domains including user prediction, marketing, and recommendation
scenarios. Our results show that instruction-aware user modeling can
effectively achieve instruction-guided denoising of user information in
specific scenarios, paving the way for more generalizable and robust user
representation learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了EasyCore核心集选择算法，通过保留训练中平均输入梯度范数(AIGN)低的样本，显著提高对抗性准确率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有核心集选择算法主要针对干净准确率设计，在保持对抗鲁棒性方面表现不足，需要从数据中心视角理解哪些样本对学习鲁棒特征最关键

Method: 提出将样本对抗脆弱性与"难度"相关联的框架，用AIGN量化样本难度，EasyCore算法只保留低AIGN的样本进行训练

Result: EasyCore选择的数据训练的模型在标准和对抗训练下，对抗准确率显著高于其他核心集方法，分别提升7%和5%

Conclusion: AIGN是模型无关的数据集属性，EasyCore是一种高效且广泛适用的数据中心方法，可显著提高对抗鲁棒性

Abstract: Designing adversarially robust models from a data-centric perspective
requires understanding which input samples are most crucial for learning
resilient features. While coreset selection provides a mechanism for efficient
training on data subsets, current algorithms are designed for clean accuracy
and fall short in preserving robustness. To address this, we propose a
framework linking a sample's adversarial vulnerability to its
\textit{hardness}, which we quantify using the average input gradient norm
(AIGN) over training. We demonstrate that \textit{easy} samples (with low AIGN)
are less vulnerable and occupy regions further from the decision boundary.
Leveraging this insight, we present EasyCore, a coreset selection algorithm
that retains only the samples with low AIGN for training. We empirically show
that models trained on EasyCore-selected data achieve significantly higher
adversarial accuracy than those trained with competing coreset methods under
both standard and adversarial training. As AIGN is a model-agnostic dataset
property, EasyCore is an efficient and widely applicable data-centric method
for improving adversarial robustness. We show that EasyCore achieves up to 7\%
and 5\% improvement in adversarial accuracy under standard training and TRADES
adversarial training, respectively, compared to existing coreset methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有保形预测方法分别应用于多元时间序列和静态图，但要么忽略图拓扑结构，要么忽视时间动态性，需要开发能同时处理图结构和时间动态的预测不确定性量化方法。

Method: 开发基于保形预测的序列预测区域框架，利用图结构捕获节点间成对依赖关系，提供用户指定的覆盖保证，并建立预测集体积相对于图无关方法的指数收缩理论。

Result: 在真实数据集上验证，该框架在保持期望经验覆盖的同时，相比现有方法实现了显著更小的预测区域（减少高达80%）。

Conclusion: 该图时间序列保形预测框架有效结合了图结构和时间动态，在保证覆盖性的同时显著提高了预测精度，为网络化动态环境中的可信决策提供了创新工具。

Abstract: Trustworthy decision making in networked, dynamic environments calls for
innovative uncertainty quantification substrates in predictive models for graph
time series. Existing conformal prediction (CP) methods have been applied
separately to multivariate time series and static graphs, but they either
ignore the underlying graph topology or neglect temporal dynamics. To bridge
this gap, here we develop a CP-based sequential prediction region framework
tailored for graph time series. A key technical innovation is to leverage the
graph structure and thus capture pairwise dependencies across nodes, while
providing user-specified coverage guarantees on the predictive outcomes. We
formally establish that our scheme yields an exponential shrinkage in the
volume of the ellipsoidal prediction set relative to its graph-agnostic
counterpart. Using real-world datasets, we demonstrate that the novel
uncertainty quantification framework maintains desired empirical coverage while
achieving markedly smaller (up to 80% reduction) prediction regions than
existing approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在生成过程中会积累误差，特别是在应用任意引导来引导样本朝向期望属性时，这会破坏样本保真度，导致离流形现象。

Method: 使用时间预测器估计每个时间步与期望数据流形的偏差，设计TAG引导机制在生成过程中将样本吸引回期望流形。

Result: 实验表明TAG能在每个时间步产生与期望流形紧密对齐的样本，在各种下游任务中显著提高生成质量。

Conclusion: TAG是一种通用解决方案，能有效解决扩散模型中的离流形问题，提升生成样本的质量和保真度。

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success as generative models.
However, even a well-trained model can accumulate errors throughout the
generation process. These errors become particularly problematic when arbitrary
guidance is applied to steer samples toward desired properties, which often
breaks sample fidelity. In this paper, we propose a general solution to address
the off-manifold phenomenon observed in diffusion models. Our approach
leverages a time predictor to estimate deviations from the desired data
manifold at each timestep, identifying that a larger time gap is associated
with reduced generation quality. We then design a novel guidance mechanism,
`Temporal Alignment Guidance' (TAG), attracting the samples back to the desired
manifold at every timestep during generation. Through extensive experiments, we
demonstrate that TAG consistently produces samples closely aligned with the
desired manifold at each timestep, leading to significant improvements in
generation quality across various downstream tasks.

Method: 提出DPNet作为基于Mamba的去噪骨干网络，采用SI-SDR损失提升波形保真度，并加入辅助心率预测器通过心率监督提供生理一致性。

Result: 在BIDMC数据集上的实验表明，该方法对合成噪声和真实运动伪影都具有强鲁棒性，优于传统滤波和现有神经模型，能有效恢复PPG信号并保持心率准确性。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了SI-SDR损失和心率引导监督的互补作用，在可穿戴医疗系统中具有实际部署潜力。

Abstract: Photoplethysmography (PPG) is widely used in wearable health monitoring, but
its reliability is often degraded by noise and motion artifacts, limiting
downstream applications such as heart rate (HR) estimation. This paper presents
a deep learning framework for PPG denoising with an emphasis on preserving
physiological information. In this framework, we propose DPNet, a Mamba-based
denoising backbone designed for effective temporal modeling. To further enhance
denoising performance, the framework also incorporates a scale-invariant
signal-to-distortion ratio (SI-SDR) loss to promote waveform fidelity and an
auxiliary HR predictor (HRP) that provides physiological consistency through
HR-based supervision. Experiments on the BIDMC dataset show that our method
achieves strong robustness against both synthetic noise and real-world motion
artifacts, outperforming conventional filtering and existing neural models. Our
method can effectively restore PPG signals while maintaining HR accuracy,
highlighting the complementary roles of SI-SDR loss and HR-guided supervision.
These results demonstrate the potential of our approach for practical
deployment in wearable healthcare systems.

Motivation: 多智能体系统和强化学习被广泛用于增强大语言模型的智能能力，但将在线策略强化学习应用于多智能体系统仍存在挑战，包括算法层面标准GRPO分组假设失效，以及系统层面需要支持多智能体工作流程。

Method: AT-GRPO包括：(i) 针对多智能体系统设计的智能体和轮次分组强化学习算法；(ii) 支持单策略和多策略模型的训练系统。

Result: 在长期规划任务中，准确率从14.0-47.0%提升到96.0-99.5%；在编码任务中平均提升3.87-7.62%；在数学任务中平均提升9.0-17.93%。

Conclusion: AT-GRPO在多智能体强化学习中表现出显著优势，为多智能体系统提供了有效的训练框架。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) and reinforcement learning (RL) are widely used to
enhance the agentic capabilities of large language models (LLMs). MAS improves
task performance through role-based orchestration, while RL uses environmental
rewards to learn stronger policies, such as GRPO-style optimization. However,
applying on-policy RL to MAS remains underexplored and presents unique
challenges. Algorithmically, standard GRPO grouping assumptions break down
because prompts vary by role and by turn. System-wise, the training stack must
support MAS-workflow rollouts and on-policy updates for both single-policy and
multi-policy models.
  We propose AT-GRPO, which includes (i) an agent- and turn-wise grouped RL
algorithm tailored to MAS and (ii) a training system that supports both single-
and multi-policy regimes. Across game, planning, coding, and math tasks,
AT-GRPO delivers substantial gains. On long-horizon planning, it increases
accuracy from a 14.0 to 47.0 percent single-agent RL baseline to 96.0 to 99.5
percent. It also improves reasoning performance, with average gains of 3.87 to
7.62 percent on coding tasks and 9.0 to 17.93 percent on math. Code and
environments are available at: https://github.com/pettingllms-ai/PettingLLMs.

Motivation: 边缘设备计算资源有限且面临分布偏移，现有TTA方法依赖梯度优化或批处理，不适合资源受限的边缘场景。无梯度替代方案学习能力有限、灵活性不足或存在架构约束。

Method: 使用协方差矩阵自适应进化策略在潜在主子空间进行前向坐标优化，通过更新紧凑的低维向量来增强输出置信度并使潜在表示更接近源分布，模型参数保持冻结。

Conclusion: TED为边缘设备提供了一种实用且可扩展的解决方案，在真实世界边缘应用中具有可行性和有效性。

Abstract: Edge devices face significant challenges due to limited computational
resources and distribution shifts, making efficient and adaptable machine
learning essential. Existing test-time adaptation (TTA) methods often rely on
gradient-based optimization or batch processing, which are inherently
unsuitable for resource-constrained edge scenarios due to their reliance on
backpropagation and high computational demands. Gradient-free alternatives
address these issues but often suffer from limited learning capacity, lack
flexibility, or impose architectural constraints. To overcome these
limitations, we propose a novel single-instance TTA method tailored for edge
devices (TED), which employs forward-only coordinate optimization in the
principal subspace of latent using the covariance matrix adaptation evolution
strategy (CMA-ES). By updating a compact low-dimensional vector, TED not only
enhances output confidence but also aligns the latent representation closer to
the source latent distribution within the latent principal subspace. This is
achieved without backpropagation, keeping the model parameters frozen, and
enabling efficient, forgetting-free adaptation with minimal memory and
computational overhead. Experiments on image classification and keyword
spotting tasks across the ImageNet and Google Speech Commands series datasets
demonstrate that TED achieves state-of-the-art performance while
$\textit{reducing computational complexity by up to 63 times}$, offering a
practical and scalable solution for real-world edge applications. Furthermore,
we successfully $\textit{deployed TED on the ZYNQ-7020 platform}$,
demonstrating its feasibility and effectiveness for resource-constrained edge
devices in real-world deployments.

Motivation: 传统方法假设变量间统计独立性，而现有图表示学习方法未能显式推断不同时间段的因果关系，难以准确检测异常

Method: 设计时间异构图表示因果过程，通过解耦潜在变量来识别不同时间段的因果关系和对应因果因子

Result: 在真实数据集上实验表明，CDRL4AD在准确性和根因分析方面优于现有最优方法

Conclusion: CDRL4AD能有效检测异常并识别因果关系，帮助专家诊断异常根因，具有实际应用价值

Abstract: Disentangling complex causal relationships is important for accurate
detection of anomalies. In multivariate time series analysis, dynamic
interactions among data variables over time complicate the interpretation of
causal relationships. Traditional approaches assume statistical independence
between variables in unsupervised settings, whereas recent methods capture
feature correlations through graph representation learning. However, their
representations fail to explicitly infer the causal relationships over
different time periods. To solve the problem, we propose Causally Disentangled
Representation Learning for Anomaly Detection (CDRL4AD) to detect anomalies and
identify their causal relationships in multivariate time series. First, we
design the causal process as model input, the temporal heterogeneous graph, and
causal relationships. Second, our representation identifies causal
relationships over different time periods and disentangles latent variables to
infer the corresponding causal factors. Third, our experiments on real-world
datasets demonstrate that CDRL4AD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms
of accuracy and root cause analysis. Fourth, our model analysis validates
hyperparameter sensitivity and the time complexity of CDRL4AD. Last, we conduct
a case study to show how our approach assists human experts in diagnosing the
root causes of anomalies.

Motivation: 生理信号应用中常因硬件限制或运动伪影导致模态缺失，现有方法假设所有模态都可用，在模态缺失时性能显著下降。

Method: 采用多模态自监督学习（对比学习+掩码预测）、双路径神经网络捕捉时间动态、以及重建解码器恢复缺失模态。

Result: PhysioME在各种模态缺失场景下实现了高一致性和泛化性能。

Conclusion: PhysioME有潜力成为现实临床环境中处理不完整数据的可靠工具。

Abstract: Missing or corrupted modalities are common in physiological signal-based
medical applications owing to hardware constraints or motion artifacts.
However, most existing methods assume the availability of all modalities,
resulting in substantial performance degradation in the absence of any
modality. To overcome this limitation, this study proposes PhysioME, a robust
framework designed to ensure reliable performance under missing modality
conditions. PhysioME adopts: (1) a multimodal self-supervised learning approach
that combines contrastive learning with masked prediction; (2) a
Dual-PathNeuroNet backbone tailored to capture the temporal dynamics of each
physiological signal modality; and (3) a restoration decoder that reconstructs
missing modality tokens, enabling flexible processing of incomplete inputs. The
experimental results show that PhysioME achieves high consistency and
generalization performance across various missing modality scenarios. These
findings highlight the potential of PhysioME as a reliable tool for supporting
clinical decision-making in real-world settings with imperfect data
availability.

Method: 使用多层级课程奖励函数，逐步引导LLM生成可编译、可执行且性能优越的交叉算子，结合算子缓存机制防止抄袭并促进多样性。

Conclusion: RFTHGS框架证明了小型专用LLM经过适当微调后，在组合优化问题中能够超越大型通用模型和专家设计，为高效启发式设计提供了新方向。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as automated
heuristic designers for vehicle routing problems (VRPs), current
state-of-the-art methods predominantly rely on prompting massive,
general-purpose models like GPT-4. This work challenges that paradigm by
demonstrating that a smaller, specialized LLM, when meticulously fine-tuned,
can generate components that surpass expert-crafted heuristics within advanced
solvers. We propose RFTHGS, a novel Reinforcement learning (RL) framework for
Fine-Tuning a small LLM to generate high-performance crossover operators for
the Hybrid Genetic Search (HGS) solver, applied to the Capacitated VRP (CVRP).
Our method employs a multi-tiered, curriculum-based reward function that
progressively guides the LLM to master generating first compilable, then
executable, and finally, superior-performing operators that exceed human expert
designs. This is coupled with an operator caching mechanism that discourages
plagiarism and promotes diversity during training. Comprehensive experiments
show that our fine-tuned LLM produces crossover operators which significantly
outperform the expert-designed ones in HGS. The performance advantage remains
consistent, generalizing from small-scale instances to large-scale problems
with up to 1000 nodes. Furthermore, RFTHGS exceeds the performance of leading
neuro-combinatorial baselines, prompt-based methods, and commercial LLMs such
as GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini.

Motivation: 热成像面部关键点检测在挑战性光照条件下很重要，但缺乏丰富的视觉线索。传统跨模态解决方案计算成本高或引入结构伪影，限制了实际部署。

Method: 提出MLCM-KD框架，将高保真RGB到热成像知识转移与模型压缩解耦。核心是DIKD双向机制，不仅用RGB特征指导学生，还将学生学到的表示反馈给冻结的教师预测头进行验证。

Result: 在公开热成像FLD基准测试中达到新的最先进水平，显著优于先前方法，同时大幅减少计算开销。

Conclusion: 该方法通过闭环监督强制学生学习与教师语义对齐的模态不变特征，确保了鲁棒且深入的知识转移。

Abstract: Facial Landmark Detection (FLD) in thermal imagery is critical for
applications in challenging lighting conditions, but it is hampered by the lack
of rich visual cues. Conventional cross-modal solutions, like feature fusion or
image translation from RGB data, are often computationally expensive or
introduce structural artifacts, limiting their practical deployment. To address
this, we propose Multi-Level Cross-Modal Knowledge Distillation (MLCM-KD), a
novel framework that decouples high-fidelity RGB-to-thermal knowledge transfer
from model compression to create both accurate and efficient thermal FLD
models. A central challenge during knowledge transfer is the profound modality
gap between RGB and thermal data, where traditional unidirectional distillation
fails to enforce semantic consistency across disparate feature spaces. To
overcome this, we introduce Dual-Injected Knowledge Distillation (DIKD), a
bidirectional mechanism designed specifically for this task. DIKD establishes a
connection between modalities: it not only guides the thermal student with rich
RGB features but also validates the student's learned representations by
feeding them back into the frozen teacher's prediction head. This closed-loop
supervision forces the student to learn modality-invariant features that are
semantically aligned with the teacher, ensuring a robust and profound knowledge
transfer. Experiments show that our approach sets a new state-of-the-art on
public thermal FLD benchmarks, notably outperforming previous methods while
drastically reducing computational overhead.

Result: 在真实世界分布外基准测试中，TACT显著优于最先进方法。

Conclusion: 通过识别和移除非因果特征，TACT能有效提升模型在测试时分布偏移下的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Test-time adaptation aims to improve model robustness under distribution
shifts by adapting models with access to unlabeled target samples. A primary
cause of performance degradation under such shifts is the model's reliance on
features that lack a direct causal relationship with the prediction target. We
introduce Test-time Adaptation by Causal Trimming (TACT), a method that
identifies and removes non-causal components from representations for test
distributions. TACT applies data augmentations that preserve causal features
while varying non-causal ones. By analyzing the changes in the representations
using Principal Component Analysis, TACT identifies the highest variance
directions associated with non-causal features. It trims the representations by
removing their projections on the identified directions, and uses the trimmed
representations for the predictions. During adaptation, TACT continuously
tracks and refines these directions to get a better estimate of non-causal
features. We theoretically analyze the effectiveness of this approach and
empirically validate TACT on real-world out-of-distribution benchmarks. TACT
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin.

Abstract: To adapt kernel two-sample and independence testing to complex structured
data, aggregation of multiple kernels is frequently employed to boost testing
power compared to single-kernel tests. However, we observe a phenomenon that
directly maximizing multiple kernel-based statistics may result in highly
similar kernels that capture highly overlapping information, limiting the
effectiveness of aggregation. To address this, we propose an aggregated
statistic that explicitly incorporates kernel diversity based on the covariance
between different kernels. Moreover, we identify a fundamental challenge: a
trade-off between the diversity among kernels and the test power of individual
kernels, i.e., the selected kernels should be both effective and diverse. This
motivates a testing framework with selection inference, which leverages
information from the training phase to select kernels with strong individual
performance from the learned diverse kernel pool. We provide rigorous
theoretical statements and proofs to show the consistency on the test power and
control of Type-I error, along with asymptotic analysis of the proposed
statistics. Lastly, we conducted extensive empirical experiments demonstrating
the superior performance of our proposed approach across various benchmarks for
both two-sample and independence testing.

Result: LSTM获得最佳性能（F1: 0.688，在81%数据集上排名第一或第二），Informer提供竞争性精度（F1: 0.683）且训练速度快30%，传统方法在简单合成数据上完美预测但真实世界数据集F1分数差2-3倍。

Conclusion: 预测质量主导检测性能：LSTM适用于复杂模式，Informer适用于效率关键部署，传统方法适用于资源受限的简单周期性数据，为基于预测的异常检测研究建立了基准。

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection is critical for modern digital infrastructures,
yet existing methods lack systematic cross-domain evaluation. We present a
comprehensive forecasting-based framework unifying classical methods
(Holt-Winters, SARIMA) with deep learning architectures (LSTM, Informer) under
a common residual-based detection interface. Our modular pipeline integrates
preprocessing (normalization, STL decomposition), four forecasting models, four
detection methods, and dual evaluation through forecasting metrics (MAE, RMSE,
PCC) and detection metrics (Precision, Recall, F1, AUC). We conduct the first
complete evaluation on the Numenta Anomaly Benchmark (58 datasets, 7
categories) with 232 model training runs and 464 detection evaluations
achieving 100\% success rate. LSTM achieves best performance (F1: 0.688,
ranking first or second on 81\% of datasets) with exceptional correlation on
complex patterns (PCC: 0.999). Informer provides competitive accuracy (F1:
0.683) with 30\% faster training. Classical methods achieve perfect predictions
on simple synthetic data with 60 lower cost but show 2-3 worse F1-scores on
real-world datasets. Forecasting quality dominates detection performance:
differences between detection methods (F1: 0.621-0.688) are smaller than
between forecasting models (F1: 0.344-0.688). Our findings provide
evidence-based guidance: use LSTM for complex patterns, Informer for
efficiency-critical deployments, and classical methods for simple periodic data
with resource constraints. The complete implementation and results establish
baselines for future forecasting-based anomaly detection research.

TL;DR: 该论文发现强化学习（RL）和监督学习（SL）在相同决策任务中会驱动循环神经网络（RNN）形成根本不同的计算策略。RL自发发现混合吸引子架构，而SL主要收敛到简单的固定点解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解学习算法如何塑造神经网络中涌现的计算策略是机器学习的基本挑战。虽然网络架构受到广泛关注，但学习范式本身在决定涌现动态中的作用仍未被充分探索。

Method: 通过系统动力学分析，比较RL和SL在相同决策任务中训练的循环神经网络，分析其吸引子架构和神经群体特征。

Result: RL发现混合吸引子架构（稳定固定点+准周期吸引子），而SL主要产生固定点解决方案。RL通过隐式正则化形成功能平衡的神经群体，增强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 学习算法是涌现计算的主要决定因素，基于奖励的优化能自主发现复杂动力学机制，这些机制在直接基于梯度的优化中较难获得。

Abstract: Understanding how learning algorithms shape the computational strategies that
emerge in neural networks remains a fundamental challenge in machine
intelligence. While network architectures receive extensive attention, the role
of the learning paradigm itself in determining emergent dynamics remains
largely unexplored. Here we demonstrate that reinforcement learning (RL) and
supervised learning (SL) drive recurrent neural networks (RNNs) toward
fundamentally different computational solutions when trained on identical
decision-making tasks. Through systematic dynamical systems analysis, we reveal
that RL spontaneously discovers hybrid attractor architectures, combining
stable fixed-point attractors for decision maintenance with quasi-periodic
attractors for flexible evidence integration. This contrasts sharply with SL,
which converges almost exclusively to simpler fixed-point-only solutions. We
further show that RL sculpts functionally balanced neural populations through a
powerful form of implicit regularization -- a structural signature that
enhances robustness and is conspicuously absent in the more heterogeneous
solutions found by SL-trained networks. The prevalence of these complex
dynamics in RL is controllably modulated by weight initialization and
correlates strongly with performance gains, particularly as task complexity
increases. Our results establish the learning algorithm as a primary
determinant of emergent computation, revealing how reward-based optimization
autonomously discovers sophisticated dynamical mechanisms that are less
accessible to direct gradient-based optimization. These findings provide both
mechanistic insights into neural computation and actionable principles for
designing adaptive AI systems.

Abstract: The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) models in real-world and high-risk
applications has intensified the discussion about their trustworthiness and
ethical usage, from both a technical and a legislative perspective. The field
of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) addresses this challenge by
proposing explanations that bring to light the decision-making processes of
complex black-box models. Despite being an essential property, the robustness
of explanations is often an overlooked aspect during development: only robust
explanation methods can increase the trust in the system as a whole. This paper
investigates the role of robustness through the usage of a feature importance
aggregation derived from multiple models ($k$-nearest neighbours, random forest
and neural networks). Preliminary results showcase the potential in increasing
the trustworthiness of the application, while leveraging multiple model's
predictive power.

TL;DR: 提出ELMO框架，使用BFloat16和Float8数据类型进行纯低精度训练，解决极端多标签分类中分类头内存和计算需求大的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 极端多标签分类中，线性分类头成为计算和内存需求的主要驱动因素，现有FP16-FP32混合精度训练存在不稳定、内存使用效率低和计算开销大的问题。

Method: 使用Kahan求和和随机舍入技术，在Float8中完全训练XMC模型，无需单精度主权重或张量缩放，结合梯度融合和分块等内存优化。

Result: 在300万标签的XMC模型中，仅使用6.6 GiB GPU内存，相比优化SOTA方法Renee的39.7 GiB显著减少，且不损失准确性。

Conclusion: ELMO框架证明XMC模型可以在纯低精度下有效训练，大幅降低GPU内存使用，为大规模标签分类提供高效解决方案。

Abstract: Large output spaces, also referred to as Extreme multilabel classification
(XMC), is a setting that arises, e.g., in large-scale tagging and
product-to-product recommendation, and is characterized by the number of labels
ranging from hundreds of thousands to millions. This means that the linear
classification head, usually only a tiny fraction of the overall model, turns
into the main driver for compute and memory demand. Current state-of-the-art
XMC methods predominantly rely on FP16-FP32 mixed-precision training, which we
show can be unstable, and inefficient in terms of memory usage and
computational overhead. Meanwhile, existing low-precision methods typically
retain higher precision for the classification layer. In this work, we propose
ELMO, a pure low-precision training framework for XMC models using BFloat16 and
Float8 data types. By leveraging Kahan summation and stochastic rounding, we
demonstrate that XMC models can be effectively trained entirely in Float8,
without relying on single-precision master weights or tensor scaling.
Low-precision training, combined with our proposed memory optimizations --
gradient fusion and chunking -- enables significant reductions in GPU memory
usage. For example, we train a 3-million-label XMC model with only 6.6 GiB of
GPU memory, compared to the 39.7 GiB required by the optimized SOTA method,
Renee without compromising accuracy.

TL;DR: EAGer是一种无需训练的方法，利用模型不确定性通过令牌熵分布来减少冗余计算并提高性能，根据提示复杂度动态分配计算预算。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 不同提示具有不同的复杂度，需要不同的计算资源，但现有方法为每个提示分配相同的计算预算，导致计算资源浪费。

Method: 通过令牌熵分布检测不确定性，仅在出现高熵令牌时分支到多个推理路径，并将节省的计算预算重新分配给最需要探索替代路径的实例。

Result: 在AIME 2025等复杂推理基准测试中，EAGer无需访问目标标签即可重新分配预算，在推理长度和Pass@k方面实现最佳效率-性能权衡。当可访问目标标签时，生成令牌减少65%，Pass@k提升37%。

Conclusion: EAGer通过动态计算预算分配，有效减少冗余计算并提升模型性能，为推理语言模型提供了高效的计算资源利用方法。

Abstract: With the rise of reasoning language models and test-time scaling methods as a
paradigm for improving model performance, substantial computation is often
required to generate multiple candidate sequences from the same prompt. This
enables exploration of different reasoning paths toward the correct solution,
however, allocates the same compute budget for each prompt. Grounded on the
assumption that different prompts carry different degrees of complexity, and
thus different computation needs, we propose EAGer, a training-free generation
method that leverages model uncertainty through token-wise entropy distribution
to reduce redundant computation and concurrently improve overall performance.
EAGer allows branching to multiple reasoning paths only in the presence of
high-entropy tokens, and then reallocates the saved compute budget to the
instances where exploration of alternative paths is most needed. We find that
across multiple open-source models on complex reasoning benchmarks such as AIME
2025, EAGer can reallocate the budget without accessing target labels,
achieving the best efficiency-performance trade-off in terms of reasoning
length and Pass@k. When target labels are accessible, EAGer generates up to 65%
fewer tokens (hence saving compute) and achieves up to 37% improvement in
Pass@k compared to the Full Parallel Sampling.

Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在推理和工具使用方面表现出色，但工具增强强化学习在不同领域的泛化能力仍未充分探索。本文旨在研究仅基于数学问题解决任务训练的LLM智能体，在其他推理领域的跨域泛化能力。

Method: 提出了Tool Generalization Reinforcement Learning (TGRL)框架，包含三个关键组件：(1) 标准化工具接口，通过一致格式化和显式终止抽象领域特定细节；(2) 双组件奖励系统，分解奖励以激励可泛化行为；(3) XML提示模板，分离思考、工具调用和响应以促进模块化规划。

Conclusion: 该研究证明了工具强化学习在LLM推理中具有显著的跨域潜力，TGRL框架能够促进领域无关的学习和技能迁移，为跨域工具增强推理提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in reasoning and tool utilization. However, the generalization of
tool-augmented reinforcement learning (RL) across diverse domains remains
underexplored. In this work, we investigate the cross-domain generalization of
an LLM agent equipped with a code interpreter tool, which is exclusively
trained on mathematical problem-solving tasks. Despite the restricted training
domain, we evaluate the agent's performance across several distinct reasoning
domains. The results reveal that RL-based tool usage learned from mathematical
tasks can be effectively transferred to complex tasks in other domains,
enabling great task performance and high token efficiency. To facilitate this
cross-domain transfer, we propose a Tool Generalization Reinforcement Learning
(TGRL) framework designed to promote domain-agnostic learning and skill
migration, encompassing: (i) a standardized tool interface that abstracts
domain-specific nuances through consistent formatting and explicit termination,
fostering transferable invocation patterns; (ii) a dual-component reward system
that decomposes rewards to incentivize generalizable behaviors like tool
efficiency and reasoning abstraction, ensuring alignment and robustness across
domain shifts; and (iii) an XML-based prompt template that separates thinking,
tool calls, and responses to encourage modular, domain-invariant planning and
coherent multi-turn interactions. Extensive experiments across diverse
benchmarks validate our approach, achieving state-of-the-art performance and
highlighting the cross-domain potential of Tool RL for LLM reasoning.

Abstract: Deciphering the function of unseen protein sequences is a fundamental
challenge with broad scientific impact, yet most existing methods depend on
task-specific adapters or large-scale supervised fine-tuning. We introduce the
"Protein-as-Second-Language" framework, which reformulates amino-acid sequences
as sentences in a novel symbolic language that large language models can
interpret through contextual exemplars. Our approach adaptively constructs
sequence-question-answer triples that reveal functional cues in a zero-shot
setting, without any further training. To support this process, we curate a
bilingual corpus of 79,926 protein-QA instances spanning attribute prediction,
descriptive understanding, and extended reasoning. Empirically, our method
delivers consistent gains across diverse open-source LLMs and GPT-4, achieving
up to 17.2% ROUGE-L improvement (average +7%) and even surpassing fine-tuned
protein-specific language models. These results highlight that generic LLMs,
when guided with protein-as-language cues, can outperform domain-specialized
models, offering a scalable pathway for protein understanding in foundation
models.

<details>

Motivation: 现有机器学习漏洞检测模型只能标记整个源代码函数为易受攻击，而无法精确定位具体代码行。检测粒度对于支持软件开发人员调试和修复漏洞至关重要。

Method: 提出了检测对齐(DA)方法，通过量化模型预测时最影响的输入代码行与真实漏洞定位之间的一致性来评估模型。该方法与模型无关，可适应不同的检测任务。

Result: 分析多个基于学习的漏洞检测器和数据集，发现这些模型的预测持续受到非易受攻击代码行的偏见影响，凸显了偏见和虚假相关性的高度影响。

Conclusion: 当前漏洞检测模型存在严重的偏见问题，检测对齐方法能够有效揭示模型是否真正理解了漏洞的语义位置，而非依赖虚假相关性进行预测。

Abstract: To address the extremely concerning problem of software vulnerability, system
security is often entrusted to Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. Despite their
now established detection capabilities, such models are limited by design to
flagging the entire input source code function as vulnerable, rather than
precisely localizing the concerned code lines. However, the detection
granularity is crucial to support human operators during software development,
ensuring that such predictions reflect the true code semantics to help debug,
evaluate, and fix the detected vulnerabilities. To address this issue, recent
work made progress toward improving the detector's localization ability, thus
narrowing down the vulnerability detection "window" and providing more
fine-grained predictions. Such approaches, however, implicitly disregard the
presence of spurious correlations and biases in the data, which often
predominantly influence the performance of ML algorithms. In this work, we
investigate how detectors comply with this requirement by proposing an
explainability-based evaluation procedure. Our approach, defined as Detection
Alignment (DA), quantifies the agreement between the input source code lines
that most influence the prediction and the actual localization of the
vulnerability as per the ground truth. Through DA, which is model-agnostic and
adaptable to different detection tasks, not limited to our use case, we analyze
multiple learning-based vulnerability detectors and datasets. As a result, we
show how the predictions of such models are consistently biased by
non-vulnerable lines, ultimately highlighting the high impact of biases and
spurious correlations. The code is available at

Abstract: Many machine learning applications require outputs that satisfy complex,

Network models due to the variable output sizes of graph-structured data. In
this paper, we introduce ProjNet, a Graph Neural Network framework which
satisfies input-dependant constraints. ProjNet combines a sparse vector
clipping method with the Component-Averaged Dykstra (CAD) algorithm, an
iterative scheme for solving the best-approximation problem. We establish a
convergence result for CAD and develop a GPU-accelerated implementation capable
of handling large-scale inputs efficiently. To enable end-to-end training, we
introduce a surrogate gradient for CAD that is both computationally efficient
and better suited for optimization than the exact gradient. We validate ProjNet
on four classes of constrained optimisation problems: linear programming, two
classes of non-convex quadratic programs, and radio transmit power
optimization, demonstrating its effectiveness across diverse problem settings.

Conclusion: NWC框架为语言模型权重压缩提供了一种有效的学习型方法，显著优于传统手动设计的压缩算法。

Abstract: The efficient storage and transmission of language model weights is becoming
increasingly important, as their scale and adoption continue to grow. However,
as our understanding of this new data modality is limited, designing a good
compression algorithm for language model weights heavily relies on manual,
trial-and-error approaches. In this paper, we propose a learned compression
framework that trains neural codecs directly from pretrained language model
weights. Unlike conventional data (e.g., images), language model weights pose
unique challenges: the sizes and shapes of weight tensors vary significantly,
and the reconstruction quality must be judged by downstream model predictions
rather than na\"ive MSE loss. To address this, we introduce Neural Weight
Compression (NWC), a novel autoencoder-based neural codec tailored to model
weight compression. The proposed method inherits the advantages of
autoencoder-based codecs while incorporating three technical components: (1)
column-wise tensor chunking and normalization; (2) an importance-aware training
loss; (3) an inference-time error compensation mechanism guided by model
outputs. Experiments on open-weight language models show that NWC achieves
competitive or state-of-the-art accuracy-compression tradeoffs, with
particularly strong results at 4-6 bit precisions where accuracy remains nearly
on par with FP16 models.

Abstract: Connection graphs (CGs) extend traditional graph models by coupling network
topology with orthogonal transformations, enabling the representation of global
geometric consistency. They play a key role in applications such as
synchronization, Riemannian signal processing, and neural sheaf diffusion. In
this work, we address the inverse problem of learning CGs directly from
observed signals. We propose a principled framework based on maximum
pseudo-likelihood under a consistency assumption, which enforces spectral
properties linking the connection Laplacian to the underlying combinatorial
Laplacian. Based on this formulation, we introduce the Structured Connection
Graph Learning (SCGL) algorithm, a block-optimization procedure over Riemannian
manifolds that jointly infers network topology, edge weights, and geometric
structure. Our experiments show that SCGL consistently outperforms existing
baselines in both topological recovery and geometric fidelity, while remaining
computationally efficient.

Conclusion: 该框架能生成高质量节点嵌入，在计算效率和分类性能方面均表现出色，适用于特征信息匮乏的图数据分类任务。

Abstract: Graph-based learning is a cornerstone for analyzing structured data, with
node classification as a central task. However, in many real-world graphs,
nodes lack informative feature vectors, leaving only neighborhood connectivity
and class labels as available signals. In such cases, effective classification
hinges on learning node embeddings that capture structural roles and
topological context. We introduce a fast semi-supervised embedding framework
that jointly optimizes three complementary objectives: (i) unsupervised
structure preservation via scalable modularity approximation, (ii) supervised
regularization to minimize intra-class variance among labeled nodes, and (iii)
semi-supervised propagation that refines unlabeled nodes through
random-walk-based label spreading with attention-weighted similarity. These
components are unified into a single iterative optimization scheme, yielding
high-quality node embeddings. On standard benchmarks, our method consistently
achieves classification accuracy at par with or superior to state-of-the-art
approaches, while requiring significantly less computational cost.

Abstract: As clinical data are becoming increasingly available, machine learning
methods have been employed to extract knowledge from them and predict clinical
events. While promising, approaches suffer from at least two main issues: low
availability of labelled data and data heterogeneity leading to missing values.
This work proposes the use of self-supervised auto-encoders to efficiently
address these challenges. We apply our methodology to a clinical dataset from
patients with ischaemic heart disease. Patient data is embedded in a latent
space, built using unlabelled data, which is then used to train a neural
network classifier to predict cardiovascular death. Results show improved
balanced accuracy compared to applying the classifier directly to the raw data,
demonstrating that this solution is promising, especially in conditions where
availability of unlabelled data could increase.

Abstract: Federated efficient fine-tuning has emerged as an approach that leverages
distributed data and computational resources across nodes to address the
challenges of large-scale fine-tuning and privacy preservation. The Low-Rank
Adaptation (LoRA) enables efficient fine-tuning of large-scale pre-trained
models by introducing trainable low-rank matrices into weight updates.However,
in heterogeneous data scenarios, client drift weakens the generalization of the
global model, and local models often fail to meet the personalized needs of
individual clients.Moreover, existing federated LoRA efficient fine-tuning
techniques overlook fine-grained analysis of the tuning matrices. To address
this, we conducted preliminary experiments and found that different LoRA
matrices exhibit different sensitivity to changes in the direction and
magnitude of their vectors.We thus propose a fine-grained federated LoRA tuning
method. By fine-tuning the more sensitive directional vectors in the A matrix,
which encode shared knowledge, our method learns shared features more
effectively across clients and enhances global generalization. Simultaneously,
by fine-tuning the more sensitive magnitude vectors in the B matrix, which
encode personalized knowledge, our method better captures personalized
knowledge, enabling detailed adaptation to local data. The method uses a
pipeline combining global and local optimizers. Global optimization further
improves local models, achieving collaborative optimization between global and
local levels. This improves both the generalization ability of the global model
and the personalized adaptation of local models under heterogeneous data
scenarios. Experiments on Databricks-Dolly-15k and Natural Instructions with
LLaMA2-7B and Deepseek-7B confirm that our method improves global performance
by 0.39% and local performance by 0.59%.

*Gareth Seneque,Lap-Hang Ho,Nafise Erfanian Saeedi,Jeffrey Molendijk,Ariel Kupermann,Tim Elson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ENIGMA是一种新颖的LLM训练方法，通过将组织政策视为信息流形上的方向移动，联合提升推理能力、对齐性和鲁棒性。该方法结合了GRPO、SAMI式辅助损失和Sinkhorn正则化，无需奖励模型即可实现原则性推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LLM训练方法在处理推理、对齐和鲁棒性时往往是分离的，作者假设这些能力实际上是单一信息几何目标的不同投影，需要统一的方法来同时优化。

Method: 使用单循环训练器结合：1) GRPO策略优化方法（基于CoT格式奖励）；2) SAMI式对称InfoNCE辅助损失；3) 隐状态分布的Sinkhorn最优传输正则化器。还引入了infoNCE指标来评估模型CoT对政策的编码强度。

Result: 在小型LLM（1B参数）上的实验表明，高SI原则预测了更稳定的训练动态和优于GRPO消融实验的基准性能。信息几何分析验证了流形结构的理想变化。

Conclusion: ENIGMA支持了推理、对齐和鲁棒性是单一信息几何目标投影的假设，无需奖励模型即可实现原则性推理，为可信能力提供了路径。

Abstract: We present Entropic Mutual-Information Geometry Large-Language Model
Alignment (ENIGMA), a novel approach to Large-Language Model (LLM) training
that jointly improves reasoning, alignment and robustness by treating an
organisation's policies/principles as directions to move on a model's
information manifold. Our single-loop trainer combines Group-Relative Policy
Optimisation (GRPO), an on-policy, critic-free RL method with Chain-of-Thought
(CoT)-format only rewards; a Self-Supervised Alignment with Mutual Information
(SAMI)-style symmetric InfoNCE auxiliary; and an entropic Sinkhorn
optimal-transport regulariser on hidden-state distributions to bound geometry
drift. We also introduce infoNCE metrics that specialise to a standard MI lower
bound under matched negatives to measure how strongly a model's CoT encodes
these policies. These metrics include a Sufficiency Index (SI) that enables the
selection and creation of principles that maximise downstream performance prior
to training. In our experiments using small (1B) LLMs, high-SI principles
predict steadier training dynamics and improved benchmark performance over GRPO
ablations. Our information-geometry analysis of trained models validates
desirable structural change in the manifold. These results support our
hypothesis that reasoning, alignment, and robustness are projections of a
single informationgeometric objective, and that models trained using ENIGMA
demonstrate principled reasoning without the use of a reward model, offering a
path to trusted capability

TL;DR: ST-Vision-LLM是一个新颖的时空预测框架，将时空预测重新定义为视觉-语言融合问题，通过Vision-LLM视觉编码器处理历史全局流量矩阵作为图像序列，结合高效的数值编码方案和两阶段微调过程，在移动流量预测中取得显著性能提升。


<details>

Motivation: 解决LLM在建模基于网格的流量数据复杂空间依赖关系方面的固有困难，以及表示密集地理网格大量信息时的效率问题。

Method: 使用Vision-LLM视觉编码器处理历史全局流量矩阵作为图像序列；引入高效编码方案将浮点值表示为单个token；采用两阶段微调过程：监督微调(SFT)和基于GRPO的强化学习优化。

Result: 在真实世界移动流量数据集上，ST-Vision-LLM在长期预测准确性上比现有方法提升15.6%，在跨域少样本场景中超过第二好基线30.04%。

Conclusion: 该模型在各种数据稀缺环境中展现出强大的泛化能力，验证了所提出方法的有效性。

Abstract: Accurate spatiotemporal traffic forecasting is a critical prerequisite for
proactive resource management in dense urban mobile networks. While Large
Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in time series analysis, they
inherently struggle to model the complex spatial dependencies of grid-based
traffic data. Effectively extending LLMs to this domain is challenging, as
representing the vast amount of information from dense geographical grids can
be inefficient and overwhelm the model's context. To address these challenges,
we propose ST-Vision-LLM, a novel framework that reframes spatiotemporal
forecasting as a vision-language fusion problem. Our approach leverages a
Vision-LLM visual encoder to process historical global traffic matrices as
image sequences, providing the model with a comprehensive global view to inform
cell-level predictions. To overcome the inefficiency of LLMs in handling
numerical data, we introduce an efficient encoding scheme that represents
floating-point values as single tokens via a specialized vocabulary, coupled
with a two-stage numerical alignment fine-tuning process. The model is first
trained with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and then further optimized for
predictive accuracy using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a
memory-efficient reinforcement learning method. Evaluations on real-world
mobile traffic datasets demonstrate that ST-Vision-LLM outperforms existing
methods by 15.6% in long-term prediction accuracy and exceeds the second-best
baseline by over 30.04% in cross-domain few-shot scenarios. Our extensive
experiments validate the model's strong generalization capabilities across
various data-scarce environments.

TL;DR: LouisKV是一个高效的KV缓存检索框架，通过语义感知检索策略和细粒度管理方案，在长序列场景中显著提升效率并保持近乎无损的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有KV缓存方法在长序列场景中存在显著内存开销，且由于逐令牌检索和粗粒度页面级管理，导致效率和准确性瓶颈，特别是在长输出推理场景中。

Method: 基于关键KV具有强时间局部性和在输入提示与生成输出中呈现不同分布模式的观察，LouisKV引入语义感知检索策略（在语义边界触发检索）和解耦的细粒度管理方案，并包含Triton和CUDA内核优化。

Result: 评估显示LouisKV相比最先进的KV检索方法实现了高达4.7倍的加速，同时在各种长序列任务中保持近乎无损的准确性。

Conclusion: LouisKV通过利用KV的时间局部性和分布特性，结合语义感知检索和细粒度管理，有效解决了长序列场景中KV缓存的内存和效率问题。

Abstract: While Key-Value (KV) cache succeeds in reducing redundant computations in
auto-regressive models, it introduces significant memory overhead, limiting its
practical deployment in long-sequence scenarios. Existing KV retrieval methods
mitigate this by dynamically retaining only a subset of KV entries on the GPU.
However, they still suffer from notable efficiency and accuracy bottlenecks due
to per-token retrieval and coarse-grained page-level KV management, especially
in long-output reasoning scenarios. With the emergence of large reasoning
models, efficiently handling such scenarios has become increasingly important.
To address this issue, we present two key observations: (1) critical KVs
exhibit strong temporal locality during decoding, and (2) these KVs exhibit
distinct distribution patterns across the input prompt and generated output.
Building on these observations, we propose LouisKV, an efficient KV cache
retrieval framework designed for various long-sequence scenarios. Specifically,
LouisKV introduces a semantic-aware retrieval strategy leveraging temporal
locality to trigger retrieval only at semantic boundaries, drastically reducing
computation and data transfer overhead. LouisKV also designs a decoupled,
fine-grained management scheme that tailors differentiated strategies for input
and output sequences to create retrieval units that better match the model's
attention patterns, enabling precise identification of critical KVs.
Furthermore, to boost efficiency, LouisKV incorporates several kernel-level
optimizations, including custom Triton and CUDA kernels to accelerate the KV
clustering and retrieval. Evaluations show that LouisKV achieves up to
4.7$\times$ speedup over state-of-the-art KV retrieval methods while
maintaining near-lossless accuracy across diverse long-sequence tasks,
including long-input short-output, short-input long-output, and long-input
long-output scenarios.

TL;DR: DiffTSST是一个基于扩散模型的时序数据风格迁移框架，通过卷积编码器分离时序数据的内容和风格表示，并通过自监督注意力扩散过程重新组合它们，实现有效的风格迁移和数据增强。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在视觉和语言领域风格迁移方法已很成熟，但时序数据的风格迁移方法仍然有限。时序风格迁移在数据增强和场景模拟等应用中能帮助机器学习模型在数据稀缺领域实现更好的泛化。

Method: 使用卷积编码器将时序数据解耦为内容和风格表示，通过自监督注意力机制的扩散过程重新组合这些表示。在推理时，从两个不同序列中提取内容和风格，实现条件生成以实现风格迁移。

Result: 定性和定量分析表明DiffTSST实现了有效的风格迁移。在数据稀缺情况下，使用DiffTSST进行数据增强能提高异常检测性能。

Conclusion: DiffTSST框架成功实现了时序数据的风格迁移，并在实际应用中证明了其通过数据增强提升异常检测能力的实用性。

Abstract: Style transfer combines the content of one signal with the style of another.
It supports applications such as data augmentation and scenario simulation,
helping machine learning models generalize in data-scarce domains. While well
developed in vision and language, style transfer methods for time series data
remain limited. We introduce DiffTSST, a diffusion-based framework that
disentangles a time series into content and style representations via
convolutional encoders and recombines them through a self-supervised
attention-based diffusion process. At inference, encoders extract content and
style from two distinct series, enabling conditional generation of novel
samples to achieve style transfer. We demonstrate both qualitatively and
quantitatively that DiffTSST achieves effective style transfer. We further
validate its real-world utility by showing that data augmentation with DiffTSST
improves anomaly detection in data-scarce regimes.

TL;DR: EVP是一个事件感知的动态图提示学习框架，可作为现有方法的插件，通过利用历史事件知识来增强动态图学习能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有动态图学习方法主要关注节点与时间的关系，但忽视了历史事件的影响。

Method: 1) 为每个节点提取历史事件序列，通过事件适应机制将事件的细粒度特征与下游任务对齐；2) 提出事件聚合机制，将历史知识有效整合到节点表示中。

Result: 在四个公共数据集上进行了广泛实验来评估和分析EVP。

Conclusion: EVP框架能够有效增强现有动态图学习方法利用历史事件知识的能力。

Abstract: Real-world graph typically evolve via a series of events, modeling dynamic
interactions between objects across various domains. For dynamic graph
learning, dynamic graph neural networks (DGNNs) have emerged as popular
solutions. Recently, prompt learning methods have been explored on dynamic
graphs. However, existing methods generally focus on capturing the relationship
between nodes and time, while overlooking the impact of historical events. In
this paper, we propose EVP, an event-aware dynamic graph prompt learning
framework that can serve as a plug-in to existing methods, enhancing their
ability to leverage historical events knowledge. First, we extract a series of
historical events for each node and introduce an event adaptation mechanism to
align the fine-grained characteristics of these events with downstream tasks.
Second, we propose an event aggregation mechanism to effectively integrate
historical knowledge into node representations. Finally, we conduct extensive
experiments on four public datasets to evaluate and analyze EVP.

Motivation: 现有的同步强化学习后训练系统存在资源利用率低和可扩展性有限的问题，需要更高效的训练架构。

Method: 基于细粒度并行和rollout-train解耦原则，提供灵活的编程接口，支持完全异步训练架构和高效的rollout机制，包括队列调度和环境级异步执行。

Result: 在相同GPU预算下，ROLL Flash在RLVR任务上实现2.24倍加速，在智能体任务上实现2.72倍加速，异步训练性能与同步训练相当。

Conclusion: ROLL Flash通过异步RL后训练显著提升了训练效率和资源利用率，为大规模语言模型的强化学习后训练提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Synchronous Reinforcement Learning (RL) post-training has emerged as a
crucial step for enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) with diverse
capabilities. However, many systems designed to accelerate RL post-training
still suffer from low resource utilization and limited scalability. We present
ROLL Flash, a system that extends ROLL with native support for asynchronous RL
post-training. ROLL Flash is built upon two core design principles:
fine-grained parallelism and rollout-train decoupling. Guided by these
principles, ROLL Flash provides flexible programming interfaces that enable a
fully asynchronous training architecture and support efficient rollout
mechanisms, including queue scheduling and environment-level asynchronous
execution. Through comprehensive theoretical analysis and extensive
experiments, we demonstrate that ROLL Flash significantly improves resource
utilization and scalability over synchronous RL post-training. ROLL Flash
achieves up to 2.24x speedup on RLVR tasks and 2.72x on agentic tasks, using
the same GPU budget as synchronous baselines. Furthermore, we implement several
popular off-policy algorithms and verify that asynchronous training can achieve
performance on par with synchronous training.

TL;DR: 提出多视图特征传播(MFP)框架，通过将特征分为多个高斯噪声视图进行独立传播，在特征稀疏情况下提升节点分类性能并保护隐私。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决图神经网络在节点分类中面临的特征稀疏性和隐私泄露问题。现实场景中特征矩阵往往高度稀疏或包含敏感信息，导致性能下降和隐私风险增加。

Method: 扩展传统特征传播(FP)，将可用特征划分为多个添加高斯噪声的视图，每个视图通过图拓扑独立传播信息，最后聚合得到鲁棒的节点嵌入表示。

Result: 在多个图数据集上的实验表明，MFP在节点分类任务上优于现有基线方法，同时显著减少隐私泄露。传播输出作为原始特征的替代插补而非重建，在保持效用的同时保护隐私。

Conclusion: MFP为具有缺失或敏感特征的图学习领域提供了一个有效且隐私感知的框架，在各种场景下都表现出稳定性和实用性。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable success in node
classification tasks over relational data, yet their effectiveness often
depends on the availability of complete node features. In many real-world
scenarios, however, feature matrices are highly sparse or contain sensitive
information, leading to degraded performance and increased privacy risks.
Furthermore, direct exposure of information can result in unintended data
leakage, enabling adversaries to infer sensitive information. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel Multi-view Feature Propagation (MFP) framework
that enhances node classification under feature sparsity while promoting
privacy preservation. MFP extends traditional Feature Propagation (FP) by
dividing the available features into multiple Gaussian-noised views, each
propagating information independently through the graph topology. The
aggregated representations yield expressive and robust node embeddings. This
framework is novel in two respects: it introduces a mechanism that improves
robustness under extreme sparsity, and it provides a principled way to balance
utility with privacy. Extensive experiments conducted on graph datasets
demonstrate that MFP outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in node
classification while substantially reducing privacy leakage. Moreover, our
analysis demonstrates that propagated outputs serve as alternative imputations
rather than reconstructions of the original features, preserving utility
without compromising privacy. A comprehensive sensitivity analysis further
confirms the stability and practical applicability of MFP across diverse
scenarios. Overall, MFP provides an effective and privacy-aware framework for
graph learning in domains characterized by missing or sensitive features.

TL;DR: 该论文首次理论分析了批量大小对Adam优化器泛化性能的影响，发现在两层过参数化CNN上，小批量Adam/AdamW能实现接近零的测试误差，而全批量版本会收敛到较差的解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有理论研究主要分析Adam的全批量版本，这与实践中使用的随机版本存在本质差异。随机Adam即使学习率很小也不会收敛到全批量对应版本，需要理论分析批量大小对Adam泛化的影响。

Method: 理论分析两层过参数化CNN在图像数据上的表现，比较Adam和AdamW在不同批量大小下的泛化性能，并推导有效权重衰减边界。

Result: 小批量Adam/AdamW能实现接近零的测试误差，而全批量版本收敛到较差解。Adam的有效权重衰减边界严格小于AdamW，解释了Adam需要更敏感的λ调优。

Conclusion: 批量大小和权重衰减在Adam的泛化性能中起关键作用，小批量训练能显著改善Adam的泛化能力，且Adam比AdamW对权重衰减超参数更敏感。

Abstract: Adam is a popular and widely used adaptive gradient method in deep learning,
which has also received tremendous focus in theoretical research. However, most
existing theoretical work primarily analyzes its full-batch version, which
differs fundamentally from the stochastic variant used in practice. Unlike SGD,
stochastic Adam does not converge to its full-batch counterpart even with
infinitesimal learning rates. We present the first theoretical characterization
of how batch size affects Adam's generalization, analyzing two-layer
over-parameterized CNNs on image data. Our results reveal that while both Adam
and AdamW with proper weight decay $\lambda$ converge to poor test error
solutions, their mini-batch variants can achieve near-zero test error. We
further prove Adam has a strictly smaller effective weight decay bound than
AdamW, theoretically explaining why Adam requires more sensitive $\lambda$
tuning. Extensive experiments validate our findings, demonstrating the critical
role of batch size and weight decay in Adam's generalization performance.

Conclusion: 这些结果可为医疗任务的模型微调、去偏等研究提供指导，建议在特定层应用这些技术。

Abstract: We present a systematic study of medical-domain interpretability in Large
Language Models (LLMs). We study how the LLMs both represent and process
medical knowledge through four different interpretability techniques: (1) UMAP
projections of intermediate activations, (2) gradient-based saliency with
respect to the model weights, (3) layer lesioning/removal and (4) activation
patching. We present knowledge maps of five LLMs which show, at a
coarse-resolution, where knowledge about patient's ages, medical symptoms,
diseases and drugs is stored in the models. In particular for Llama3.3-70B, we
find that most medical knowledge is processed in the first half of the model's
layers. In addition, we find several interesting phenomena: (i) age is often
encoded in a non-linear and sometimes discontinuous manner at intermediate
layers in the models, (ii) the disease progression representation is
non-monotonic and circular at certain layers of the model, (iii) in
Llama3.3-70B, drugs cluster better by medical specialty rather than mechanism
of action, especially for Llama3.3-70B and (iv) Gemma3-27B and MedGemma-27B
have activations that collapse at intermediate layers but recover by the final
layers. These results can guide future research on fine-tuning, un-learning or
de-biasing LLMs for medical tasks by suggesting at which layers in the model
these techniques should be applied.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) emerges as a new learning paradigm that enables
multiple devices to collaboratively train a shared model while preserving data
privacy. However, one fundamental and prevailing challenge that hinders the
deployment of FL on mobile devices is the memory limitation. This paper
proposes \textit{FedHybrid}, a novel framework that effectively reduces the
memory footprint during the training process while guaranteeing the model
accuracy and the overall training progress. Specifically, \textit{FedHybrid}
first selects the participating devices for each training round by jointly
evaluating their memory budget, computing capability, and data diversity. After
that, it judiciously analyzes the computational graph and generates an
execution plan for each selected client in order to meet the corresponding
memory budget while minimizing the training delay through employing a hybrid of
recomputation and compression techniques according to the characteristic of
each tensor. During the local training process, \textit{FedHybrid} carries out
the execution plan with a well-designed activation compression technique to
effectively achieve memory reduction with minimum accuracy loss. We conduct
extensive experiments to evaluate \textit{FedHybrid} on both simulation and
off-the-shelf mobile devices. The experiment results demonstrate that
\textit{FedHybrid} achieves up to a 39.1\% increase in model accuracy and a
15.5$\times$ reduction in wall clock time under various memory budgets compared
with the baselines.

Abstract: The creation of systematic literature reviews (SLR) is critical for analyzing
the landscape of a research field and guiding future research directions.
However, retrieving and filtering the literature corpus for an SLR is highly
time-consuming and requires extensive manual effort, as keyword-based searches
in digital libraries often return numerous irrelevant publications. In this
work, we propose a pipeline leveraging multiple large language models (LLMs),
classifying papers based on descriptive prompts and deciding jointly using a
consensus scheme. The entire process is human-supervised and interactively
controlled via our open-source visual analytics web interface, LLMSurver, which
enables real-time inspection and modification of model outputs. We evaluate our
approach using ground-truth data from a recent SLR comprising over 8,000
candidate papers, benchmarking both open and commercial state-of-the-art LLMs
from mid-2024 and fall 2025. Results demonstrate that our pipeline
significantly reduces manual effort while achieving lower error rates than
single human annotators. Furthermore, modern open-source models prove
sufficient for this task, making the method accessible and cost-effective.
Overall, our work demonstrates how responsible human-AI collaboration can
accelerate and enhance systematic literature reviews within academic workflows.

Conclusion: 这项工作展示了生成建模在ECG重建中的潜力，对可扩展、低成本的心脏筛查具有重要意义。

Abstract: Twelve-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) are the clinical gold standard for
cardiac diagnosis, providing comprehensive spatial coverage of the heart
necessary to detect conditions such as myocardial infarction (MI). However,
their lack of portability limits continuous and large-scale use. Three-lead ECG
systems are widely used in wearable devices due to their simplicity and
mobility, but they often fail to capture pathologies in unmeasured regions. To
address this, we propose WearECG, a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) method that
reconstructs twelve-lead ECGs from three leads: II, V1, and V5. Our model
includes architectural improvements to better capture temporal and spatial
dependencies in ECG signals. We evaluate generation quality using MSE, MAE, and
Frechet Inception Distance (FID), and assess clinical validity via a Turing
test with expert cardiologists. To further validate diagnostic utility, we
fine-tune ECGFounder, a large-scale pretrained ECG model, on a multi-label
classification task involving over 40 cardiac conditions, including six
different myocardial infarction locations, using both real and generated
signals. Experiments on the MIMIC dataset show that our method produces
physiologically realistic and diagnostically informative signals, with robust
performance in downstream tasks. This work demonstrates the potential of
generative modeling for ECG reconstruction and its implications for scalable,
low-cost cardiac screening.

TL;DR: 提出了一个统一框架来分析摊销学习方法，将其分为参数化、隐式和显式三种机制，并针对现有方法难以处理大数据集的问题，提出了迭代摊销推理方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代学习系统越来越多地依赖摊销学习，但各种方法在如何编码和利用任务特定信息方面存在差异，且大多数方法难以扩展到大数据集。

Method: 提出了一个统一框架，将摊销模型分为参数化、隐式和显式三种机制，并引入了迭代摊销推理方法，该方法通过小批量逐步优化解决方案。

Result: 该框架为通用任务适应提供了可扩展和可扩展的基础，弥合了基于优化的元学习和前向传递摊销之间的差距。

Conclusion: 迭代摊销推理为解决摊销学习方法在大数据集上的扩展性问题提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Modern learning systems increasingly rely on amortized learning - the idea of
reusing computation or inductive biases shared across tasks to enable rapid
generalization to novel problems. This principle spans a range of approaches,
including meta-learning, in-context learning, prompt tuning, learned optimizers
and more. While motivated by similar goals, these approaches differ in how they
encode and leverage task-specific information, often provided as in-context
examples. In this work, we propose a unified framework which describes how such
methods differ primarily in the aspects of learning they amortize - such as
initializations, learned updates, or predictive mappings - and how they
incorporate task data at inference. We introduce a taxonomy that categorizes
amortized models into parametric, implicit, and explicit regimes, based on
whether task adaptation is externalized, internalized, or jointly modeled.
Building on this view, we identify a key limitation in current approaches: most
methods struggle to scale to large datasets because their capacity to process
task data at inference (e.g., context length) is often limited. To address
this, we propose iterative amortized inference, a class of models that refine
solutions step-by-step over mini-batches, drawing inspiration from stochastic
optimization. Our formulation bridges optimization-based meta-learning with
forward-pass amortization in models like LLMs, offering a scalable and
extensible foundation for general-purpose task adaptation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 级联排名系统广泛用于大规模信息检索，但Top-K算子不可微分，阻碍端到端训练。现有方法存在目标不一致或梯度冲突问题，且复杂度较高。

Method: 通过放松归一化约束，DFTopK获得闭式解，避免排序操作，直接构建可微分的Top-K选择算子近似。

Result: 在RecFLow基准和工业系统中，DFTopK显著提升训练效率并实现更优性能，在线A/B测试获得+1.77%收入提升。

Conclusion: 这是首次将可微分Top-K算子引入推荐系统，并首次实现理论最优的线性时间复杂度Top-K选择，已开源实现。

Abstract: Cascade ranking is a widely adopted paradigm in large-scale information
retrieval systems for Top-K item selection. However, the Top-K operator is
non-differentiable, hindering end-to-end training. Existing methods include
Learning-to-Rank approaches (e.g., LambdaLoss), which optimize ranking metrics
like NDCG and suffer from objective misalignment, and differentiable
sorting-based methods (e.g., ARF, LCRON), which relax permutation matrices for
direct Top-K optimization but introduce gradient conflicts through matrix
aggregation. A promising alternative is to directly construct a differentiable
approximation of the Top-K selection operator, bypassing the use of soft
permutation matrices. However, even state-of-the-art differentiable Top-K
operator (e.g., LapSum) require $O(n \log n)$ complexity due to their
dependence on sorting for solving the threshold. Thus, we propose DFTopK, a
novel differentiable Top-K operator achieving optimal $O(n)$ time complexity.
By relaxing normalization constraints, DFTopK admits a closed-form solution and
avoids sorting. DFTopK also avoids the gradient conflicts inherent in
differentiable sorting-based methods. We evaluate DFTopK on both the public
benchmark RecFLow and an industrial system. Experimental results show that
DFTopK significantly improves training efficiency while achieving superior
performance, which enables us to scale up training samples more efficiently. In
the online A/B test, DFTopK yielded a +1.77\% revenue lift with the same
computational budget compared to the baseline. To the best of our knowledge,
this work is the first to introduce differentiable Top-K operators into
recommendation systems and the first to achieve theoretically optimal
linear-time complexity for Top-K selection. We have open-sourced our
implementation to facilitate future research in both academia and industry.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种减少整数AI推理中重缩放成本的方法，通过后训练应用更强的量化到重缩放乘数，并引入了重缩放感知训练方法，可在保持模型精度的同时显著降低硬件成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 整数AI推理在嵌入式系统中显著降低计算复杂度，但量化感知训练仍忽略了整数重缩放操作的影响，这在整数AI推理中是一个硬件成本高昂的操作。

Method: 提出后训练应用更强量化到重缩放乘数的方法，并引入重缩放感知训练，这是一种针对超低比特宽度重缩放乘数的微调方法。

Result: 实验表明，即使重缩放器宽度减少8倍，通过最小增量重新训练仍能保持完整精度。

Conclusion: 该方法为资源受限的嵌入式系统实现了更节能和成本效益更高的AI推理。

Abstract: Integer AI inference significantly reduces computational complexity in
embedded systems. Quantization-aware training (QAT) helps mitigate accuracy
degradation associated with post-training quantization but still overlooks the
impact of integer rescaling during inference, which is a hardware costly
operation in integer-only AI inference. This work shows that rescaling cost can
be dramatically reduced post-training, by applying a stronger quantization to
the rescale multiplicands at no model-quality loss. Furthermore, we introduce
Rescale-Aware Training, a fine tuning method for ultra-low bit-width rescaling
multiplicands. Experiments show that even with 8x reduced rescaler widths, the
full accuracy is preserved through minimal incremental retraining. This enables
more energy-efficient and cost-efficient AI inference for resource-constrained
embedded systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个理论框架来解释为什么在预训练后使用强化学习比仅使用下一个词预测能更好地训练大语言模型进行推理任务。通过奇偶校验任务的案例研究，证明了强化学习能够利用更长的推理序列来促进泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究神经网络在推理领域的最新进展主要依赖于一种训练方法：先用下一个词预测预训练大语言模型，然后用强化学习算法进行优化。本文旨在理论分析这种范式成功的原因，揭示强化学习相比单纯下一个词预测的优化机制。

Method: 研究从包含短和长"思维链"序列的混合分布中学习，其中任务为预测d位比特的奇偶性。在简化设置下，理论上证明了自回归线性模型遵循这种训练方法可以高效学习奇偶预测。还在Llama系列模型上进行了数学推理基准测试的验证。

Result: 当长序列稀少时，强化学习能够使自回归transformer模型实现泛化，而单纯的下一个词预测需要极端的统计或计算资源才能达到相同效果。强化学习通过利用测试时更长的响应（计算）来促进学习过程。

Conclusion: 强化学习在预训练后的应用能够有效利用长序列推理来提升模型在复杂推理任务上的表现，特别是在长演示序列比例不随输入维度指数级减少的情况下，可以实现高效学习。

Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning domains with neural networks have primarily been
enabled by a training recipe that optimizes Large Language Models, previously
trained to predict the next-token in a sequence, with reinforcement learning
algorithms. We introduce a framework to study the success of this paradigm, and
we theoretically expose the optimization mechanisms by which reinforcement
learning improves over next-token prediction in this setting. We study learning
from mixture distributions of short and long ``chain-of-thought'' sequences
encoding a single task. In particular, when the task consists of predicting the
parity of $d$ bits and long sequences are rare, we show how reinforcement
learning after next-token prediction enables autoregressive transformers to
generalize, whereas mere next-token prediction requires extreme statistical or
computational resources to do so. We further explain how reinforcement learning
leverages increased test-time computation, manifested in longer responses, to
facilitate this learning process. In a simplified setting, we theoretically
prove that autoregressive linear models following this training recipe can
efficiently learn to predict the parity of $d$ bits as long as the proportion
of long demonstrations in the data mix is not exponentially small in the input
dimension $d$. Finally, we demonstrate these same phenomena in other settings,
including the post-training of Llama-series models on mixture variations of
common mathematical reasoning benchmarks.

TL;DR: ReLook是一个基于视觉的强化学习框架，通过多模态大语言模型作为工具，实现前端代码的生成-诊断-优化循环，显著提升前端开发能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在算法代码生成方面表现出色，但在前端开发中表现不佳，因为前端代码的正确性需要通过渲染像素和交互来判断。

Method: 采用代理式、视觉基础的强化学习框架，利用多模态LLM作为视觉评论家和反馈源，引入强制优化策略确保单调改进轨迹。

Result: 在三个广泛使用的基准测试中，ReLook在视觉基础的前端代码生成方面持续优于强基线方法。

Conclusion: 代理感知、视觉奖励和训练-推理解耦带来了显著优势，证明了该框架在前端代码生成中的有效性。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at algorithmic code generation, they
struggle with front-end development, where correctness is judged on rendered
pixels and interaction. We present ReLook, an agentic, vision-grounded
reinforcement learning framework that empowers an agent to close a robust
generate--diagnose--refine loop by invoking a multimodal LLM (MLLM) as a tool.
During training, the agent uses the MLLM-in-the-loop both as a visual
critic--scoring code with screenshots--and as a source of actionable,
vision-grounded feedback; a strict zero-reward rule for invalid renders anchors
renderability and prevents reward hacking. To prevent behavioral collapse, we
introduce Forced Optimization, a strict acceptance rule that admits only
improving revisions, yielding monotonically better trajectories. At inference,
we decouple the critic and run a lightweight, critic-free self-edit cycle,
keeping latency comparable to base decoding while retaining most of the gains.
Across three widely used benchmarks, ReLook consistently outperforms strong
baselines in vision-grounded front-end code generation, highlighting the
benefits of agentic perception, visual rewards, and training-inference
decoupling.

Motivation: 现有生成模型在离线强化学习中面临计算效率与性能的权衡：扩散策略计算昂贵，一致性策略性能较差。需要一种方法能同时兼顾高性能和计算效率。

Method: 将现代生成模型统一为学习ODE控制的连续时间生成轨迹，提出GTP学习底层ODE的完整解映射，并引入两个理论上有原则的适配方法。

Result: 在D4RL基准测试中达到最先进性能，显著优于先前生成策略，在多个困难的AntMaze任务上获得完美分数。

Conclusion: GTP成功弥合了生成模型在离线强化学习中的性能与效率差距，证明了统一ODE视角的有效性。

Abstract: Generative models have emerged as a powerful class of policies for offline
reinforcement learning (RL) due to their ability to capture complex,
multi-modal behaviors. However, existing methods face a stark trade-off: slow,
iterative models like diffusion policies are computationally expensive, while
fast, single-step models like consistency policies often suffer from degraded
performance. In this paper, we demonstrate that it is possible to bridge this
gap. The key to moving beyond the limitations of individual methods, we argue,
lies in a unifying perspective that views modern generative models, including
diffusion, flow matching, and consistency models, as specific instances of
learning a continuous-time generative trajectory governed by an Ordinary
Differential Equation (ODE). This principled foundation provides a clearer
design space for generative policies in RL and allows us to propose Generative
Trajectory Policies (GTPs), a new and more general policy paradigm that learns
the entire solution map of the underlying ODE. To make this paradigm practical
for offline RL, we further introduce two key theoretically principled
adaptations. Empirical results demonstrate that GTP achieves state-of-the-art
performance on D4RL benchmarks - it significantly outperforms prior generative
policies, achieving perfect scores on several notoriously hard AntMaze tasks.

TL;DR: 提出MISTAKE方法，通过利用错误答案与潜在误解之间的循环一致性构建高质量推理错误示例，用于学生模拟、误解分类和答案生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语言模型推理研究主要关注提高输出正确性，但教育等应用需要建模错误的推理模式，如模拟学生错误以提供实时反馈。

Method: MISTAKE方法：1) 利用错误答案与潜在误解的循环一致性构建合成推理错误示例；2) 使用生成数据学习学生模拟、误解分类和答案生成模型。

Result: 在三个教育任务上的评估显示：1) 基于特定误解模拟错误学生答案的准确率更高；2) 从观察到的错误答案推断潜在误解的性能提升；3) 生成错误答案时与专家编写的干扰项对齐度更高。

Conclusion: MISTAKE方法能有效建模错误推理模式，在教育应用中具有实用价值，特别是在学生模拟、误解识别和干扰项生成方面表现优异。

Abstract: Research on reasoning in language models (LMs) predominantly focuses on
improving the correctness of their outputs. But some important applications
require modeling reasoning patterns that are incorrect. For example, automated
systems that can reason about and simulate student errors are useful for
providing real-time feedback in the classroom or offline practice for
educators-in-training. This paper presents a new method, MISTAKE, that (1)
constructs high-quality synthetic examples of reasoning errors by leveraging
cycle consistency between incorrect answers and latent misconceptions; and (2)
uses the generated data to learn models for student simulation, misconception
classification, and answer generation. We evaluate MISTAKE on three educational
tasks and find that it results in (1) higher accuracy when simulating incorrect
student answers based on specific misconceptions, (2) increased performance
inferring latent misconceptions from observed incorrect answers, and (3) higher
alignment with expert-written distractor answers when generating incorrect
answers (e.g., for multiple-choice tests).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 蒸散发在陆气相互作用中至关重要，但准确量化不同时空尺度的蒸散发仍具挑战性。原位测量方法只能获取单点数据，而农业应用需要大范围每个田块的蒸散发估算，无法在每个位置部署传感系统。

Method: 整合基于树的机器学习（随机森林、CatBoost、XGBoost、LightGBM）和知识引导的机器学习技术，结合多光谱遥感数据、网格化气象数据和涡动协方差数据，使用k折交叉验证和站点-年份、生物群落分层训练测试分割。

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了蒸散发的升尺度估算，新生成的网格化产品与州级气象站蒸散发估算具有最佳对应关系，为农业水资源管理提供了可靠工具。

Abstract: Evapotranspiration (ET) plays a critical role in the land-atmosphere
interactions, yet its accurate quantification across various spatiotemporal
scales remains a challenge. In situ measurement approaches, like eddy
covariance (EC) or weather station-based ET estimation, allow for measuring ET
at a single location. Agricultural uses of ET require estimates for each field
over broad areas, making it infeasible to deploy sensing systems at each
location. This study integrates tree-based and knowledge-guided machine
learning (ML) techniques with multispectral remote sensing data, griddled
meteorology and EC data to upscale ET across the Midwest United States. We
compare four tree-based models - Random Forest, CatBoost, XGBoost, LightGBM -
and a simple feed-forward artificial neural network in combination with
features engineered using knowledge-guided ML principles. Models were trained
and tested on EC towers located in the Midwest of the United States using
k-fold cross validation with k=5 and site-year, biome stratified train-test
split to avoid data leakage. Results show that LightGBM with knowledge-guided
features outperformed other methods with an R2=0.86, MSE=14.99 W m^-2 and MAE =
8.82 W m^-2 according to grouped k-fold validation (k=5). Feature importance
analysis shows that knowledge-guided features were most important for
predicting evapotranspiration. Using the best performing model, we provide a
data product at 500 m spatial and one-day temporal resolution for gridded ET
for the period of 2019-2024. Intercomparison between the new gridded product
and state-level weather station-based ET estimates show best-in-class
correspondence.

Method: 首先构建多信息级别知识图来建模不同信息级别，然后设计查询特定图神经网络进行表示学习，采用查询引导的层内/层间消息传递机制，并通过两种合成数据生成策略进行预训练。

Result: 实验结果表明该框架在多跳场景中表现有效，特别是在高跳问题上改进可达33.8%。

Conclusion: 提出的图表示学习框架能够有效解决多跳问题检索中的挑战，通过多粒度信息聚合和噪声抑制显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has demonstrated its ability to enhance
Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating external knowledge sources.
However, multi-hop questions, which require the identification of multiple
knowledge targets to form a synthesized answer, raise new challenges for RAG
systems. Under the multi-hop settings, existing methods often struggle to fully
understand the questions with complex semantic structures and are susceptible
to irrelevant noise during the retrieval of multiple information targets. To
address these limitations, we propose a novel graph representation learning
framework for multi-hop question retrieval. We first introduce a
Multi-information Level Knowledge Graph (Multi-L KG) to model various
information levels for a more comprehensive understanding of multi-hop
questions. Based on this, we design a Query-Specific Graph Neural Network
(QSGNN) for representation learning on the Multi-L KG. QSGNN employs
intra/inter-level message passing mechanisms, and in each message passing the
information aggregation is guided by the query, which not only facilitates
multi-granular information aggregation but also significantly reduces the
impact of noise. To enhance its ability to learn robust representations, we
further propose two synthesized data generation strategies for pre-training the
QSGNN. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our
framework in multi-hop scenarios, especially in high-hop questions the
improvement can reach 33.8\%. The code is available at:

Conclusion: 扩散模型为决策聚焦学习提供了有效的概率建模框架，提出的轻量级训练方法在保持性能的同时降低了计算开销。

Abstract: Decision-focused learning (DFL) integrates predictive modeling and
optimization by training predictors to optimize the downstream decision target
rather than merely minimizing prediction error. To date, existing DFL methods
typically rely on deterministic point predictions, which are often insufficient
to capture the intrinsic stochasticity of real-world environments. To address
this challenge, we propose the first diffusion-based DFL approach, which trains
a diffusion model to represent the distribution of uncertain parameters and
optimizes the decision by solving a stochastic optimization with samples drawn
from the diffusion model. Our contributions are twofold. First, we formulate
diffusion DFL using the reparameterization trick, enabling end-to-end training
through diffusion. While effective, it is memory and compute-intensive due to
the need to differentiate through the diffusion sampling process. Second, we
propose a lightweight score function estimator that uses only several forward
diffusion passes and avoids backpropagation through the sampling. This follows
from our results that backpropagating through stochastic optimization can be
approximated by a weighted score function formulation. We empirically show that
our diffusion DFL approach consistently outperforms strong baselines in
decision quality. The source code for all experiments is available at the
project repository: https://github.com/GT-KOALA/Diffusion_DFL.

Motivation: 传统统计套利方法未能充分考虑交易成本对盈利性的影响，需要开发能够联合优化因子识别和交易策略的框架。

Method: 使用注意力因子作为条件潜在因子，从公司特征嵌入中学习复杂交互，通过序列模型从因子残差组合中识别时间序列信号，并联合估计因子和交易策略。

Result: 在24年期间对美国最大股票的回测显示，注意力因子模型的样本外夏普比率超过4，考虑交易成本后的夏普比率达到前所未有的2.3。

Conclusion: 联合优化因子和交易策略对最大化交易成本后的盈利能力至关重要，弱因子在套利交易中具有重要作用。

Abstract: Statistical arbitrage exploits temporal price differences between similar
assets. We develop a framework to jointly identify similar assets through
factors, identify mispricing and form a trading policy that maximizes
risk-adjusted performance after trading costs. Our Attention Factors are
conditional latent factors that are the most useful for arbitrage trading. They
are learned from firm characteristic embeddings that allow for complex
interactions. We identify time-series signals from the residual portfolios of
our factors with a general sequence model. Estimating factors and the arbitrage
trading strategy jointly is crucial to maximize profitability after trading
costs. In a comprehensive empirical study we show that our Attention Factor
model achieves an out-of-sample Sharpe ratio above 4 on the largest U.S.
equities over a 24-year period. Our one-step solution yields an unprecedented
Sharpe ratio of 2.3 net of transaction costs. We show that weak factors are
important for arbitrage trading.

Conclusion: MATH-B基准将推动探索驱动的强化学习方法发展，激发更深层次的推理能力，超越当前方法的局限性。

Abstract: With the advent of DeepSeek-R1, a new wave of reinforcement learning (RL)
methods has emerged that seem to unlock stronger mathematical reasoning.
However, a closer look at the open-source ecosystem reveals a critical
limitation: with sufficiently many draws (e.g., $\texttt{pass@1024}$), many
existing base models already solve nearly all questions on widely used math
benchmarks such as MATH-500 and AIME 2024. This suggests that the RL
fine-tuning methods prevalent in the LLM reasoning literature largely sharpen
existing solution modes rather than discovering entirely new ones. Such
sharpening stands in contrast to the broader promise of RL: to foster
exploration and to acquire new skills. To move beyond this plateau, we
introduce MATH-Beyond (MATH-B), a benchmark deliberately constructed to defeat
common open-source models of up to 8B parameters even under large sampling
budgets. Improving performance on our benchmark via RL requires methods that
learn to reason in ways that go beyond base model capabilities in repeated
sampling. Since the problems are drawn from subsets of DAPO-Math-17K and
DeepScaleR datasets, they remain topically equivalent to standard high-school
math. Validating our premise, RL fine-tuned models such as
Nemotron-Research-Reasoning-Qwen-1.5B and DeepScaleR-1.5B-Preview perform
poorly on MATH-B at $\texttt{pass@1024}$, showing how existing approaches fall
short on tackling harder instances. We hope MATH-B will catalyze
exploration-driven RL approaches that elicit deeper reasoning capabilities. We
release MATH-B at https://huggingface.co/datasets/brendel-group/MATH-Beyond.

TL;DR: 本文研究了动态测度传输在生成建模中的应用，特别关注由连接源分布和目标分布的随机过程诱导的流。文章提出了直线流的概念，即点加速度为零的流，并给出了直线性的PDE特征描述。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究哪些随机过程能产生直线流，这样的流可以用一阶方法精确积分，从而简化生成模型的训练和推理过程。

Method: 通过分析随机过程的条件期望和速度场，推导出直线流的PDE特征方程，并研究仿射时间插值和确定性端点耦合的情况。

Result: 完全刻画了仿射时间插值，证明直线性仅在确定性端点耦合下发生，并为一般过程推导了约束流几何的必要条件。

Conclusion: 为设计更容易积分的传输过程提供了广泛指导，有助于改进生成模型的效率和性能。

Abstract: We study dynamic measure transport for generative modeling: specifically,
flows induced by stochastic processes that bridge a specified source and target
distribution. The conditional expectation of the process' velocity defines an
ODE whose flow map achieves the desired transport. We ask \emph{which processes
produce straight-line flows} -- i.e., flows whose pointwise acceleration
vanishes and thus are exactly integrable with a first-order method? We provide
a concise PDE characterization of straightness as a balance between conditional
acceleration and the divergence of a weighted covariance (Reynolds) tensor.
Using this lens, we fully characterize affine-in-time interpolants and show
that straightness occurs exactly under deterministic endpoint couplings. We
also derive necessary conditions that constrain flow geometry for general
processes, offering broad guidance for designing transports that are easier to
integrate.

TL;DR: 提出了一个时间一致的大型语言模型家族，通过定义知识截止日期来消除前瞻偏差，确保模型仅使用截止日期前的数据进行训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 消除预测任务中的前瞻偏差，确保模型训练数据与预测时间严格分离，提供无数据泄露的预测工具。

Method: 训练一系列时间一致的大型语言模型，每个模型仅使用明确知识截止日期前的数据，确保严格的时间分离。

Result: 开发出具有对话界面、开放模型权重和保守预测精度下限的框架，为研究人员提供易于使用且无前瞻偏差的生成式AI工具。

Abstract: We introduce a family of chronologically consistent, instruction-following
large language models to eliminate lookahead bias. Each model is trained only
on data available before a clearly defined knowledge-cutoff date, ensuring
strict temporal separation from any post-cutoff data. The resulting framework
offers (i) a simple, conversational chat interface, (ii) fully open, fixed
model weights that guarantee replicability, and (iii) a conservative lower
bound on forecast accuracy, isolating the share of predictability that survives
once training leakage is removed. Together, these features provide researchers
with an easy-to-use generative AI tool useful for a wide range of prediction
tasks that is free of lookahead bias.

*Nianyi Lin,Jiajie Zhang,Lei Hou,Juanzi Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了BGPO算法，通过构建特殊的ELBO下界来解决扩散大语言模型RL训练中的内存瓶颈问题，实现了恒定内存使用和更精确的似然估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在扩散大语言模型的RL训练中需要保留所有蒙特卡洛样本的前向计算图，导致内存开销巨大，限制了样本数量，进而影响似然估计精度和RL目标。

Method: 提出边界引导策略优化(BGPO)，构建满足线性和等价性两个关键特性的特殊下界，使每个项仅依赖单个MC样本，支持梯度累积和恒定内存使用。

Result: 实验表明BGPO在数学问题求解、代码生成和规划任务中显著优于之前的dLLM RL算法。

Conclusion: BGPO通过内存高效的算法设计解决了扩散大语言模型RL训练的关键瓶颈，实现了更好的性能表现。

Abstract: A key challenge in applying reinforcement learning (RL) to diffusion large
language models (dLLMs) lies in the intractability of their likelihood
functions, which are essential for the RL objective, necessitating
corresponding approximation in each training step. While existing methods
approximate the log-likelihoods by their evidence lower bounds (ELBOs) via
customized Monte Carlo (MC) sampling, the forward computational graphs of all
MC samples need to be retained for the gradient computation of non-linear terms
in the RL objective, resulting in significant memory overhead. This constraint
restricts feasible sample sizes, leading to imprecise likelihood approximations
and ultimately distorting the RL objective. To overcome this limitation, we
propose \emph{Boundary-Guided Policy Optimization} (BGPO), a memory-efficient
RL algorithm that maximizes a specially constructed lower bound of the
ELBO-based objective. This lower bound is carefully designed to satisfy two key
properties: (1) Linearity: it is formulated in a linear sum where each term
depends only on a single MC sample, thereby enabling gradient accumulation
across samples and ensuring constant memory usage; (2) Equivalence: Both the
value and gradient of this lower bound are equal to those of the ELBO-based
objective in on-policy training, making it also an effective approximation for
the original RL objective. These properties allow BGPO to adopt a large MC
sample size, resulting in more accurate likelihood approximations and improved
RL objective estimation, which in turn leads to enhanced performance.
Experiments show that BGPO significantly outperforms previous RL algorithms for
dLLMs in math problem solving, code generation, and planning tasks.

*Jens Tuyls,Dylan J. Foster,Akshay Krishnamurthy,Jordan T. Ash*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文研究了在语言模型强化学习中引入基于表示多样性的探索机制，通过在预训练模型的隐藏状态上构建简单原则化的多样性奖励，显著提升了推理任务的多样性和成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究当前RL技术是否真正促进语言模型发现新行为，还是仅仅强化已有行为，探索预训练模型知识如何指导搜索过程。

Method: 使用基于预训练语言模型隐藏状态的表示多样性奖励，在推理时和后训练两个场景中实施有意识的探索策略。

Result: 基于表示多样性的探索显著提升了多样性和pass@k率，在推理时提高效率（如Qwen-2.5-14b-Instruct验证器效率提升超50%），在后训练中推理性能超过初始模型和标准RL后训练。

Conclusion: 有意识的探索配合正确的多样性概念是超越简单强化的实用路径，能够发现语言模型的新行为。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) promises to expand the capabilities of language
models, but it is unclear if current RL techniques promote the discovery of
novel behaviors, or simply sharpen those already present in the base model. In
this paper, we investigate the value of deliberate exploration -- explicitly
incentivizing the model to discover novel and diverse behaviors -- and aim to
understand how the knowledge in pre-trained models can guide this search. Our
main finding is that exploration with a simple, principled,
representation-based bonus derived from the pre-trained language model's hidden
states significantly improves diversity and pass@k rates -- both for
post-training, and in a novel inference-time scaling setting we introduce. For
inference-time, exploration with representation-based diversity improves
efficiency, consistently improving pass@k rates across a variety of models and
reasoning tasks. For example, for Qwen-2.5-14b-Instruct we obtain over 50%
improvement in verifier efficiency on almost all tasks. For post-training, we
show that integrating this exploration strategy into an RL pipeline improves
reasoning performance over that of the initial model and over standard RL
post-training. For example, on AIME 2024, our post-trained
Qwen-2.5-7b-Instruct's pass@80 matches the pass@256 of GRPO on the same model,
demonstrating a 3x improvement in test-time sample efficiency. Overall, our
findings suggest that deliberate exploration -- with the right notion of
diversity -- is a practical path toward discovery of new behaviors beyond
sharpening.

TL;DR: 本文研究了乐观Hedge算法在两人零和博弈中的遗憾最优性，改进了社交和个体遗憾上界至O(√log m log n)，并证明了这些上界无法进一步改进，同时改进了最后迭代收敛率和动态遗憾。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究乐观Hedge算法在强非耦合学习动态中的遗憾最优性，特别是对动作数量m和n的依赖关系是否最优。

Method: 通过将遗憾上界表示为关于学习率和某些负项系数的优化问题，进行精细化分析；提供算法依赖的个体遗憾下界证明最优性。

Result: 在强非耦合设置下，社交和个体遗憾上界改进为O(√log m log n)；证明了这些上界无法进一步改进，且社交遗憾上下界在主导项常数上完全匹配。

Conclusion: 乐观Hedge算法的社交和个体遗憾对m和n的依赖关系是最优的，基于这些结果还改进了最后迭代收敛率和动态遗憾，并提供了匹配的动态遗憾下界。

Abstract: In two-player zero-sum games, the learning dynamic based on optimistic Hedge
achieves one of the best-known regret upper bounds among strongly-uncoupled
learning dynamics. With an appropriately chosen learning rate, the social and
individual regrets can be bounded by $O(\log(mn))$ in terms of the numbers of
actions $m$ and $n$ of the two players. This study investigates the optimality
of the dependence on $m$ and $n$ in the regret of optimistic Hedge. To this
end, we begin by refining existing regret analysis and show that, in the
strongly-uncoupled setting where the opponent's number of actions is known,
both the social and individual regret bounds can be improved to $O(\sqrt{\log m
\log n})$. In this analysis, we express the regret upper bound as an
optimization problem with respect to the learning rates and the coefficients of
certain negative terms, enabling refined analysis of the leading constants. We
then show that the existing social regret bound as well as these new social and
individual regret upper bounds cannot be further improved for optimistic Hedge
by providing algorithm-dependent individual regret lower bounds. Importantly,
these social regret upper and lower bounds match exactly including the constant
factor in the leading term. Finally, building on these results, we improve the
last-iterate convergence rate and the dynamic regret of a learning dynamic
based on optimistic Hedge, and complement these bounds with algorithm-dependent
dynamic regret lower bounds that match the improved bounds.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: QeRL是一个量化增强的强化学习框架，通过结合NVFP4量化和LoRA技术，加速LLM的强化学习训练过程，同时减少内存开销，并利用量化噪声增强探索能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习在大型语言模型中资源密集，需要大量GPU内存和长时间的训练过程，限制了其应用规模。

Method: 结合NVFP4量化和低秩适应(LoRA)技术，引入自适应量化噪声(AQN)机制动态调整训练过程中的噪声水平。

Result: 在rollout阶段实现1.5倍加速，首次在单个H100 80GB GPU上训练32B参数的LLM，在GSM8K和MATH 500数学基准测试中达到90.8%和77.4%的准确率。

Conclusion: QeRL为LLM的强化学习训练提供了一个高效且有效的框架，在保持性能的同时显著提升了训练效率。

Abstract: We propose QeRL, a Quantization-enhanced Reinforcement Learning framework for
large language models (LLMs). While RL is essential for LLMs' reasoning
capabilities, it is resource-intensive, requiring substantial GPU memory and
long rollout durations. QeRL addresses these issues by combining NVFP4
quantization with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), accelerating rollout phase of RL
while reducing memory overhead. Beyond efficiency, our findings show that
quantization noise increases policy entropy, enhancing exploration, and
enabling the discovery of better strategies during RL. To further optimize
exploration, QeRL introduces an Adaptive Quantization Noise (AQN) mechanism,
which dynamically adjusts noise during training. Experiments demonstrate that
QeRL delivers over 1.5 times speedup in the rollout phase. Moreover, this is
the first framework to enable RL training of a 32B LLM on a single H100 80GB
GPU, while delivering overall speedups for RL training. It also achieves faster
reward growth and higher final accuracy than 16-bit LoRA and QLoRA, while
matching the performance of full-parameter fine-tuning on mathematical
benchmarks such as GSM8K (90.8%) and MATH 500 (77.4%) in the 7B model. These
results establish QeRL as an efficient and effective framework for RL training
in LLMs.

*Edward Stevinson,Lucas Prieto,Melih Barsbey,Tolga Birdal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出对抗性漏洞源于神经网络的高效信息编码机制，特别是叠加表示（superposition）导致特征干扰，使攻击者能够利用这些干扰模式进行预测性攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决关于对抗性样本起源的根本问题，挑战现有观点（决策边界不规则性或非鲁棒特征敏感性），提出对抗性漏洞可能是网络表示压缩的副产品。

Method: 通过精确控制叠加的合成设置验证假设，并在CIFAR-10上训练的ViT模型中进行实证验证，分析特征排列与攻击模式的关系。

Result: 证明叠加足以产生对抗性漏洞，攻击模式可从特征排列中预测，解释了模型间攻击可迁移性和类特定漏洞模式。

Conclusion: 对抗性漏洞是网络表示压缩的自然结果，而非学习过程缺陷或非鲁棒输入问题，这为理解对抗性攻击提供了新的机制性解释。

Abstract: Fundamental questions remain about when and why adversarial examples arise in
neural networks, with competing views characterising them either as artifacts
of the irregularities in the decision landscape or as products of sensitivity
to non-robust input features. In this paper, we instead argue that adversarial
vulnerability can stem from efficient information encoding in neural networks.
Specifically, we show how superposition - where networks represent more
features than they have dimensions - creates arrangements of latent
representations that adversaries can exploit. We demonstrate that adversarial
perturbations leverage interference between superposed features, making attack
patterns predictable from feature arrangements. Our framework provides a
mechanistic explanation for two known phenomena: adversarial attack
transferability between models with similar training regimes and class-specific
vulnerability patterns. In synthetic settings with precisely controlled
superposition, we establish that superposition suffices to create adversarial
vulnerability. We then demonstrate that these findings persist in a ViT trained
on CIFAR-10. These findings reveal adversarial vulnerability can be a byproduct
of networks' representational compression, rather than flaws in the learning
process or non-robust inputs.

Abstract: This paper proposes a synergy of amortised and particle-based methods for
sampling from distributions defined by unnormalised density functions. We state
a connection between sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) and neural sequential
samplers trained by maximum-entropy reinforcement learning (MaxEnt RL), wherein
learnt sampling policies and value functions define proposal kernels and twist
functions. Exploiting this connection, we introduce an off-policy RL training
procedure for the sampler that uses samples from SMC -- using the learnt
sampler as a proposal -- as a behaviour policy that better explores the target
distribution. We describe techniques for stable joint training of proposals and
twist functions and an adaptive weight tempering scheme to reduce training
signal variance. Furthermore, building upon past attempts to use experience
replay to guide the training of neural samplers, we derive a way to combine
historical samples with annealed importance sampling weights within a replay
buffer. On synthetic multi-modal targets (in both continuous and discrete
spaces) and the Boltzmann distribution of alanine dipeptide conformations, we
demonstrate improvements in approximating the true distribution as well as
training stability compared to both amortised and Monte Carlo methods.
