### [1] [A Quality-Guided Mixture of Score-Fusion Experts Framework for Human Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00053)
*Jie Zhu,Yiyang Su,Minchul Kim,Anil Jain,Xiaoming Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为QME的新框架，通过学习性分数融合策略提升全身生物识别性能，通过质量估计和分数三元组损失优化结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统全身生物识别方法可能忽略各模态分数分布的差异，限制了性能提升。

Method: 采用Mixture of Experts (MoE)框架，引入伪质量损失和质量估计器(QE)，结合分数三元组损失优化分数融合。

Result: 在多个数据集上取得最先进结果，优于基线方法。

Conclusion: QME框架有效解决了多模态和多模型中的关键挑战，如分数域模型不对齐和数据质量变化。

Abstract: Whole-body biometric recognition is a challenging multimodal task that
integrates various biometric modalities, including face, gait, and body. This
integration is essential for overcoming the limitations of unimodal systems.
Traditionally, whole-body recognition involves deploying different models to
process multiple modalities, achieving the final outcome by score-fusion (e.g.,
weighted averaging of similarity matrices from each model). However, these
conventional methods may overlook the variations in score distributions of
individual modalities, making it challenging to improve final performance. In
this work, we present \textbf{Q}uality-guided \textbf{M}ixture of score-fusion
\textbf{E}xperts (QME), a novel framework designed for improving whole-body
biometric recognition performance through a learnable score-fusion strategy
using a Mixture of Experts (MoE). We introduce a novel pseudo-quality loss for
quality estimation with a modality-specific Quality Estimator (QE), and a score
triplet loss to improve the metric performance. Extensive experiments on
multiple whole-body biometric datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our
proposed approach, achieving state-of-the-art results across various metrics
compared to baseline methods. Our method is effective for multimodal and
multi-model, addressing key challenges such as model misalignment in the
similarity score domain and variability in data quality.

*Raiyaan Abdullah,Jared Claypoole,Michael Cogswell,Ajay Divakaran,Yogesh Rawat*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文探讨了动作识别模型在高层次运动概念跨多样上下文中的迁移能力，发现模型在新情境下识别动作时性能显著下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动作识别模型是否能有效迁移高层次运动概念到不同上下文，即使是在相似分布中。

Method: 引入了一个运动迁移性框架，使用三个数据集（Syn-TA、Kinetics400-TA、Something-Something-v2-TA）评估了13个先进模型。

Result: 模型在新情境下识别高层次动作时性能显著下降；多模态模型在细粒度未知动作上表现更差；Syn-TA与真实数据集同样具有挑战性；大模型在空间线索主导时表现更好，但在时间推理上表现不佳。

Conclusion: 研究为评估动作识别中的运动迁移性提供了重要基准，并探讨了分离粗粒度和细粒度运动对提升识别的潜力。

Abstract: Action recognition models demonstrate strong generalization, but can they
effectively transfer high-level motion concepts across diverse contexts, even
within similar distributions? For example, can a model recognize the broad
action "punching" when presented with an unseen variation such as "punching
person"? To explore this, we introduce a motion transferability framework with
three datasets: (1) Syn-TA, a synthetic dataset with 3D object motions; (2)
Kinetics400-TA; and (3) Something-Something-v2-TA, both adapted from natural
video datasets. We evaluate 13 state-of-the-art models on these benchmarks and
observe a significant drop in performance when recognizing high-level actions
in novel contexts. Our analysis reveals: 1) Multimodal models struggle more
with fine-grained unknown actions than with coarse ones; 2) The bias-free
Syn-TA proves as challenging as real-world datasets, with models showing
greater performance drops in controlled settings; 3) Larger models improve
transferability when spatial cues dominate but struggle with intensive temporal
reasoning, while reliance on object and background cues hinders generalization.
We further explore how disentangling coarse and fine motions can improve
recognition in temporally challenging datasets. We believe this study
establishes a crucial benchmark for assessing motion transferability in action
recognition. Datasets and relevant code:

### [3] [The Monado SLAM Dataset for Egocentric Visual-Inertial Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00088)
*Mateo de Mayo,Daniel Cremers,Taihú Pire*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了Monado SLAM数据集，用于解决现有VIO/SLAM系统在头戴设备应用中面临的挑战性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VIO/SLAM系统在头戴设备应用中难以应对高动态运动、遮挡、低纹理环境等现实问题，缺乏相关数据集。

Method: 通过收集多款虚拟现实头戴设备的真实序列数据，构建Monado SLAM数据集。

Result: 数据集以CC BY 4.0许可发布，旨在推动VIO/SLAM技术的发展。

Conclusion: Monado SLAM数据集填补了现有研究的空白，为头戴设备应用的VIO/SLAM研究提供了重要资源。

Abstract: Humanoid robots and mixed reality headsets benefit from the use of
head-mounted sensors for tracking. While advancements in visual-inertial
odometry (VIO) and simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) have produced
new and high-quality state-of-the-art tracking systems, we show that these are
still unable to gracefully handle many of the challenging settings presented in
the head-mounted use cases. Common scenarios like high-intensity motions,
dynamic occlusions, long tracking sessions, low-textured areas, adverse
lighting conditions, saturation of sensors, to name a few, continue to be
covered poorly by existing datasets in the literature. In this way, systems may
inadvertently overlook these essential real-world issues. To address this, we
present the Monado SLAM dataset, a set of real sequences taken from multiple
virtual reality headsets. We release the dataset under a permissive CC BY 4.0
license, to drive advancements in VIO/SLAM research and development.

### [4] [Exploring the Feasibility of Deep Learning Techniques for Accurate Gender Classification from Eye Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00135)
*Basna Mohammed Salih Hasan,Ramadhan J. Mstafa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于卷积神经网络（CNN）的模型，利用眼周区域的颜色图像进行性别分类，在CVBL和（Female and Male）数据集上分别达到99%和96%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 性别分类在安全、人机交互等领域至关重要，但化妆品和伪装等因素会影响分类准确性。研究专注于眼周区域，因其包含丰富的视觉线索。

Method: 采用CNN模型，利用眼周区域的颜色图像提取特征进行性别分类，并在两个数据集上验证性能。

Result: 模型在CVBL数据集上达到99%准确率，在（Female and Male）数据集上达到96%准确率，参数较少（7,235,089）。

Conclusion: 模型表现优异，适用于安全和监控等实际应用。

Abstract: Gender classification has emerged as a crucial aspect in various fields,
including security, human-machine interaction, surveillance, and advertising.
Nonetheless, the accuracy of this classification can be influenced by factors
such as cosmetics and disguise. Consequently, our study is dedicated to
addressing this concern by concentrating on gender classification using color
images of the periocular region. The periocular region refers to the area
surrounding the eye, including the eyelids, eyebrows, and the region between
them. It contains valuable visual cues that can be used to extract key features
for gender classification. This paper introduces a sophisticated Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN) model that utilizes color image databases to evaluate the
effectiveness of the periocular region for gender classification. To validate
the model's performance, we conducted tests on two eye datasets, namely CVBL
and (Female and Male). The recommended architecture achieved an outstanding
accuracy of 99% on the previously unused CVBL dataset while attaining a
commendable accuracy of 96% with a small number of learnable parameters
(7,235,089) on the (Female and Male) dataset. To ascertain the effectiveness of
our proposed model for gender classification using the periocular region, we
evaluated its performance through an extensive range of metrics and compared it
with other state-of-the-art approaches. The results unequivocally demonstrate
the efficacy of our model, thereby suggesting its potential for practical
application in domains such as security and surveillance.

### [5] [World Consistency Score: A Unified Metric for Video Generation Quality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00144)
*Akshat Rakheja,Aarsh Ashdhir,Aryan Bhattacharjee,Vanshika Sharma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: World Consistency Score (WCS) 是一种新的生成视频模型评估指标，强调视频的内部世界一致性，整合了四个可解释的子组件，并通过学习权重公式生成一致性分数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频评估指标主要关注视觉保真度或提示对齐，缺乏对视频内部世界一致性的全面评估。WCS旨在填补这一空白。

Method: WCS结合四个子指标（物体持久性、关系稳定性、因果合规性和闪烁惩罚），通过开源工具计算，并使用人类偏好数据训练权重。

Result: WCS通过实验验证（如VBench-2.0、EvalCrafter等）与人类评估相关性高，且优于现有指标（FVD、CLIPScore等）。

Conclusion: WCS提供了一个全面且可解释的框架，用于评估视频生成模型在保持时间一致性方面的能力。

Abstract: We introduce World Consistency Score (WCS), a novel unified evaluation metric
for generative video models that emphasizes internal world consistency of the
generated videos. WCS integrates four interpretable sub-components - object
permanence, relation stability, causal compliance, and flicker penalty - each
measuring a distinct aspect of temporal and physical coherence in a video.
These submetrics are combined via a learned weighted formula to produce a
single consistency score that aligns with human judgments. We detail the
motivation for WCS in the context of existing video evaluation metrics,
formalize each submetric and how it is computed with open-source tools
(trackers, action recognizers, CLIP embeddings, optical flow), and describe how
the weights of the WCS combination are trained using human preference data. We
also outline an experimental validation blueprint: using benchmarks like
VBench-2.0, EvalCrafter, and LOVE to test WCS's correlation with human
evaluations, performing sensitivity analyses, and comparing WCS against
established metrics (FVD, CLIPScore, VBench, FVMD). The proposed WCS offers a
comprehensive and interpretable framework for evaluating video generation
models on their ability to maintain a coherent "world" over time, addressing
gaps left by prior metrics focused only on visual fidelity or prompt alignment.

### [6] [GeoExplorer: Active Geo-localization with Curiosity-Driven Exploration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00152)
*Li Mi,Manon Bechaz,Zeming Chen,Antoine Bosselut,Devis Tuia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GeoExplorer是一种主动地理定位（AGL）代理，通过内在奖励驱动的探索策略，提高了在复杂或未知环境中的鲁棒性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于距离奖励的强化学习方法在目标或环境未知时表现不佳，需要更可靠的探索策略。

Method: 提出GeoExplorer，利用好奇心驱动的内在奖励进行目标无关的探索，增强环境建模能力。

Result: 在四个AGL基准测试中验证了GeoExplorer的有效性，特别是在未知目标和环境中的表现。

Conclusion: GeoExplorer通过好奇心驱动探索，显著提升了AGL任务的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Active Geo-localization (AGL) is the task of localizing a goal, represented
in various modalities (e.g., aerial images, ground-level images, or text),
within a predefined search area. Current methods approach AGL as a
goal-reaching reinforcement learning (RL) problem with a distance-based reward.
They localize the goal by implicitly learning to minimize the relative distance
from it. However, when distance estimation becomes challenging or when
encountering unseen targets and environments, the agent exhibits reduced
robustness and generalization ability due to the less reliable exploration
strategy learned during training. In this paper, we propose GeoExplorer, an AGL
agent that incorporates curiosity-driven exploration through intrinsic rewards.
Unlike distance-based rewards, our curiosity-driven reward is goal-agnostic,
enabling robust, diverse, and contextually relevant exploration based on
effective environment modeling. These capabilities have been proven through
extensive experiments across four AGL benchmarks, demonstrating the
effectiveness and generalization ability of GeoExplorer in diverse settings,
particularly in localizing unfamiliar targets and environments.

### [7] [Robust 3D Object Detection using Probabilistic Point Clouds from Single-Photon LiDARs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00169)
*Bhavya Goyal,Felipe Gutierrez-Barragan,Wei Lin,Andreas Velten,Yin Li,Mohit Gupta*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为概率点云（PPC）的新型3D场景表示方法，通过为每个点添加概率属性来封装原始数据的不确定性，从而提升3D物体检测的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代LiDAR在远距离或低反射率物体等场景中会产生稀疏或错误的点云，这些误差会传播到下游感知模型中，导致精度下降。传统3D处理流程未保留原始测量中的不确定性信息。

Method: 提出PPC表示方法，为每个点添加概率属性，并引入基于PPC的推理方法，可作为轻量级模块集成到3D推理流程中。

Result: 通过仿真和实际数据验证，PPC方法在室内外场景中优于LiDAR及相机-LiDAR融合模型，尤其在处理小、远距离、低反射率物体及强环境光时表现突出。

Conclusion: PPC通过保留不确定性信息，显著提升了3D物体检测的鲁棒性和准确性，适用于多种复杂场景。

Abstract: LiDAR-based 3D sensors provide point clouds, a canonical 3D representation
used in various scene understanding tasks. Modern LiDARs face key challenges in
several real-world scenarios, such as long-distance or low-albedo objects,
producing sparse or erroneous point clouds. These errors, which are rooted in
the noisy raw LiDAR measurements, get propagated to downstream perception
models, resulting in potentially severe loss of accuracy. This is because
conventional 3D processing pipelines do not retain any uncertainty information
from the raw measurements when constructing point clouds.
  We propose Probabilistic Point Clouds (PPC), a novel 3D scene representation
where each point is augmented with a probability attribute that encapsulates
the measurement uncertainty (or confidence) in the raw data. We further
introduce inference approaches that leverage PPC for robust 3D object
detection; these methods are versatile and can be used as computationally
lightweight drop-in modules in 3D inference pipelines. We demonstrate, via both
simulations and real captures, that PPC-based 3D inference methods outperform
several baselines using LiDAR as well as camera-LiDAR fusion models, across
challenging indoor and outdoor scenarios involving small, distant, and
low-albedo objects, as well as strong ambient light.

### [8] [On the Risk of Misleading Reports: Diagnosing Textual Biases in Multimodal Clinical AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00171)
*David Restrepo,Ira Ktena,Maria Vakalopoulou,Stergios Christodoulidis,Enzo Ferrante*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种选择性模态转移（SMS）方法，用于量化视觉语言模型（VLMs）在二元分类任务中对每种模态的依赖程度，揭示了模型对文本输入的显著依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床决策依赖于医学图像和相关临床报告的综合分析，但现有VLMs常偏向于一种模态（如文本），忽略视觉信息。

Method: 通过选择性模态转移（SMS）方法，系统地交换样本中的图像或文本，评估模型在扰动前后的表现和校准。

Result: 实验发现VLMs对文本输入有显著依赖，视觉信息常被忽略，即使存在互补的视觉信息。

Conclusion: 设计多模态医学模型时需真正整合视觉和文本信息，而非依赖单一模态信号。

Abstract: Clinical decision-making relies on the integrated analysis of medical images
and the associated clinical reports. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) can
offer a unified framework for such tasks, they can exhibit strong biases toward
one modality, frequently overlooking critical visual cues in favor of textual
information. In this work, we introduce Selective Modality Shifting (SMS), a
perturbation-based approach to quantify a model's reliance on each modality in
binary classification tasks. By systematically swapping images or text between
samples with opposing labels, we expose modality-specific biases. We assess six
open-source VLMs-four generalist models and two fine-tuned for medical data-on
two medical imaging datasets with distinct modalities: MIMIC-CXR (chest X-ray)
and FairVLMed (scanning laser ophthalmoscopy). By assessing model performance
and the calibration of every model in both unperturbed and perturbed settings,
we reveal a marked dependency on text input, which persists despite the
presence of complementary visual information. We also perform a qualitative
attention-based analysis which further confirms that image content is often
overshadowed by text details. Our findings highlight the importance of
designing and evaluating multimodal medical models that genuinely integrate
visual and textual cues, rather than relying on single-modality signals.

Motivation: 为数学模型的架构设计提供一种层次化增长的图结构，支持高效的代数操作和类型构造，适用于机器学习和计算科学等领域。

Method: 定义图的“谱系”及其增长规则，推导分级图的低开销代数操作（如乘积、和、函数类型等），并引入空间高效的一元操作（如加厚和升级）。

Result: 提出了一种分级图和层次图谱系的代数类型理论，适用于分层模型架构和局部采样、搜索或优化算法。

Conclusion: 该方法适用于定义分层模型架构（如深度神经网络和多网格数值方法），并展示了其应用潜力。

Abstract: Graphs, and sequences of growing graphs, can be used to specify the
architecture of mathematical models in many fields including machine learning
and computational science. Here we define structured graph "lineages" (ordered
by level number) that grow in a hierarchical fashion, so that: (1) the number
of graph vertices and edges increases exponentially in level number; (2)
bipartite graphs connect successive levels within a graph lineage and, as in
multigrid methods, can constrain matrices relating successive levels; (3) using
prolongation maps within a graph lineage, process-derived distance measures
between graphs at successive levels can be defined; (4) a category of "graded
graphs" can be defined, and using it low-cost "skeletal" variants of standard
algebraic graph operations and type constructors (cross product, box product,
disjoint sum, and function types) can be derived for graded graphs and hence
hierarchical graph lineages; (5) these skeletal binary operators have similar
but not identical algebraic and category-theoretic properties to their standard
counterparts; (6) graph lineages and their skeletal product constructors can
approach continuum limit objects. Additional space-efficient unary operators on
graded graphs are also derived: thickening, which creates a graph lineage of
multiscale graphs, and escalation to a graph lineage of search frontiers
(useful as a generalization of adaptive grids and in defining "skeletal"
functions). The result is an algebraic type theory for graded graphs and
(hierarchical) graph lineages. The approach is expected to be well suited to
defining hierarchical model architectures - "hierarchitectures" - and local
sampling, search, or optimization algorithms on them. We demonstrate such
application to deep neural networks (including visual and feature scale spaces)
and to multigrid numerical methods.

### [10] [Learning Personalised Human Internal Cognition from External Expressive Behaviours for Real Personality Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00205)
*Xiangyu Kong,Hengde Zhu,Haoqin Sun,Zhihao Guo,Jiayan Gu,Xinyi Ni,Wei Zhang,Shizhe Liu,Siyang Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于个性化内部认知的自动真实人格识别方法，通过模拟目标个体的内部认知来提升识别性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常作为外部观察者推断人格印象，与真实人格存在偏差，导致识别性能不佳。

Method: 通过短音频-视觉行为模拟个性化内部认知，将其表示为网络权重，并构建二维图，利用2D-GNN进行人格推断。

Result: 提出了一种端到端的训练策略，联合优化认知模拟、图构建和人格识别模块。

Conclusion: 该方法通过模拟内部认知，显著提升了真实人格识别的性能。

Abstract: Automatic real personality recognition (RPR) aims to evaluate human real
personality traits from their expressive behaviours. However, most existing
solutions generally act as external observers to infer observers' personality
impressions based on target individuals' expressive behaviours, which
significantly deviate from their real personalities and consistently lead to
inferior recognition performance. Inspired by the association between real
personality and human internal cognition underlying the generation of
expressive behaviours, we propose a novel RPR approach that efficiently
simulates personalised internal cognition from easy-accessible external short
audio-visual behaviours expressed by the target individual. The simulated
personalised cognition, represented as a set of network weights that enforce
the personalised network to reproduce the individual-specific facial reactions,
is further encoded as a novel graph containing two-dimensional node and edge
feature matrices, with a novel 2D Graph Neural Network (2D-GNN) proposed for
inferring real personality traits from it. To simulate real personality-related
cognition, an end-to-end strategy is designed to jointly train our cognition
simulation, 2D graph construction, and personality recognition modules.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAM-PTx通过轻量级适配器设计，将CLIP文本嵌入引入SAM模型，提升语义引导的分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索语义文本提示在分割任务中的潜力，弥补传统空间提示的不足。

Method: 提出Parallel-Text适配器，将文本嵌入注入SAM图像编码器，仅修改MLP并行分支。

Result: 在COD10K、COCO和ADE20K数据集上，语义提示显著优于纯空间提示基线。

Conclusion: 语义条件集成是高效适应SAM的实用且可扩展路径。

Abstract: The Segment Anything Model (SAM) has demonstrated impressive generalization
in prompt-based segmentation. Yet, the potential of semantic text prompts
remains underexplored compared to traditional spatial prompts like points and
boxes. This paper introduces SAM-PTx, a parameter-efficient approach for
adapting SAM using frozen CLIP-derived text embeddings as class-level semantic
guidance. Specifically, we propose a lightweight adapter design called
Parallel-Text that injects text embeddings into SAM's image encoder, enabling
semantics-guided segmentation while keeping most of the original architecture
frozen. Our adapter modifies only the MLP-parallel branch of each transformer
block, preserving the attention pathway for spatial reasoning. Through
supervised experiments and ablations on the COD10K dataset as well as low-data
subsets of COCO and ADE20K, we show that incorporating fixed text embeddings as
input improves segmentation performance over purely spatial prompt baselines.
To our knowledge, this is the first work to use text prompts for segmentation
on the COD10K dataset. These results suggest that integrating semantic
conditioning into SAM's architecture offers a practical and scalable path for
efficient adaptation with minimal computational complexity.

*Aymane Abdali,Bartosz Boguslawski,Lucas Drumetz,Vincent Gripon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 在少样本图像分类中，通过引入物体局部位置信息显著提升分类性能，且仅需少量标注或完全无监督方法即可实现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决少样本图像分类中因图像模糊（如多物体或复杂背景）导致的性能下降问题。

Method: 利用Segment Anything Model（仅需标注一个像素）或无监督前景物体提取方法，引入物体局部位置信息。

Result: 在多个基准测试中显著提升了分类性能。

Conclusion: 局部位置信息的引入是提升少样本图像分类性能的有效方法，且实现成本低。

Abstract: In the domain of Few-Shot Image Classification, operating with as little as
one example per class, the presence of image ambiguities stemming from multiple
objects or complex backgrounds can significantly deteriorate performance. Our
research demonstrates that incorporating additional information about the local
positioning of an object within its image markedly enhances classification
across established benchmarks. More importantly, we show that a significant
fraction of the improvement can be achieved through the use of the Segment
Anything Model, requiring only a pixel of the object of interest to be pointed
out, or by employing fully unsupervised foreground object extraction methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种多尺度融合U形Mamba模型（MSF-UM），用于深度图超分辨率，结合Mamba的高效状态空间建模能力和多尺度融合策略，显著提升重建精度并减少参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统卷积神经网络在长程依赖和全局上下文建模方面有限，而Transformer计算复杂度高，难以处理高分辨率深度图。

Method: 设计了一种结合残差密集通道注意力块和Mamba状态空间模块的结构，利用多尺度跨模态融合策略，通过彩色图像的高频纹理信息指导深度图超分辨率。

Result: 在多个公开数据集上验证了模型的有效性，显著减少了参数数量并提升了重建精度，尤其在大规模深度图超分辨率任务中表现出色。

Conclusion: MSF-UM模型在深度图超分辨率任务中表现出优越的性能和泛化能力，为相关领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Depth map super-resolution technology aims to improve the spatial resolution
of low-resolution depth maps and effectively restore high-frequency detail
information. Traditional convolutional neural network has limitations in
dealing with long-range dependencies and are unable to fully model the global
contextual information in depth maps. Although transformer can model global
dependencies, its computational complexity and memory consumption are
quadratic, which significantly limits its ability to process high-resolution
depth maps. In this paper, we propose a multi-scale fusion U-shaped Mamba
(MSF-UM) model, a novel guided depth map super-resolution framework. The core
innovation of this model is to integrate Mamba's efficient state-space modeling
capabilities into a multi-scale U-shaped fusion structure guided by a color
image. The structure combining the residual dense channel attention block and
the Mamba state space module is designed, which combines the local feature
extraction capability of the convolutional layer with the modeling advantage of
the state space model for long-distance dependencies. At the same time, the
model adopts a multi-scale cross-modal fusion strategy to make full use of the
high-frequency texture information from the color image to guide the
super-resolution process of the depth map. Compared with existing mainstream
methods, the proposed MSF-UM significantly reduces the number of model
parameters while achieving better reconstruction accuracy. Extensive
experiments on multiple publicly available datasets validate the effectiveness
of the model, especially showing excellent generalization ability in the task
of large-scale depth map super-resolution.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在初始化时间长和多视角一致性不足的问题，PointGauss旨在通过点云分割驱动的流程直接解析高斯基元来解决这些问题。

Method: 提出点云高斯基元解码器和GPU加速的2D掩码渲染系统，分别实现快速3D实例分割和多视角一致性。

Result: 实验显示性能提升1.89%至31.78%（多视角mIoU），并保持高效计算。同时发布了DesktopObjects-360数据集，解决现有基准的局限性。

Conclusion: PointGauss在多目标分割中表现出色，结合新数据集为3D分割研究提供了更全面的评估标准。

Abstract: We introduce PointGauss, a novel point cloud-guided framework for real-time
multi-object segmentation in Gaussian Splatting representations. Unlike
existing methods that suffer from prolonged initialization and limited
multi-view consistency, our approach achieves efficient 3D segmentation by
directly parsing Gaussian primitives through a point cloud segmentation-driven
pipeline. The key innovation lies in two aspects: (1) a point cloud-based
Gaussian primitive decoder that generates 3D instance masks within 1 minute,
and (2) a GPU-accelerated 2D mask rendering system that ensures multi-view
consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant improvements over
previous state-of-the-art methods, achieving performance gains of 1.89 to
31.78% in multi-view mIoU, while maintaining superior computational efficiency.
To address the limitations of current benchmarks (single-object focus,
inconsistent 3D evaluation, small scale, and partial coverage), we present
DesktopObjects-360, a novel comprehensive dataset for 3D segmentation in
radiance fields, featuring: (1) complex multi-object scenes, (2) globally
consistent 2D annotations, (3) large-scale training data (over 27 thousand 2D
masks), (4) full 360{\deg} coverage, and (5) 3D evaluation masks.

(VLMs) to incorporate knowledge from new tasks without retraining data from
previous ones. Recent methods update a visual projector to translate visual
information for new tasks, connecting pre-trained vision encoders with large
language models. However, such adjustments may cause the models to prioritize
visual inputs over language instructions, particularly learning tasks with
repetitive types of textual instructions. To address the neglect of language
instructions, we propose a novel framework that grounds the translation of
visual information on instructions for language models. We introduce a mixture
of visual projectors, each serving as a specialized visual-to-language
translation expert based on the given instruction context to adapt to new
tasks. To avoid using experts for irrelevant instruction contexts, we propose
an expert recommendation strategy that reuses experts for tasks similar to
those previously learned. Additionally, we introduce expert pruning to
alleviate interference from the use of experts that cumulatively activated in
previous tasks. Extensive experiments on diverse vision-language tasks
demonstrate that our method outperforms existing continual learning approaches
by generating instruction-following responses.

Abstract: Multimodal referring segmentation aims to segment target objects in visual
scenes, such as images, videos, and 3D scenes, based on referring expressions
in text or audio format. This task plays a crucial role in practical
applications requiring accurate object perception based on user instructions.
Over the past decade, it has gained significant attention in the multimodal
community, driven by advances in convolutional neural networks, transformers,
and large language models, all of which have substantially improved multimodal
perception capabilities. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of
multimodal referring segmentation. We begin by introducing this field's
background, including problem definitions and commonly used datasets. Next, we
summarize a unified meta architecture for referring segmentation and review
representative methods across three primary visual scenes, including images,
videos, and 3D scenes. We further discuss Generalized Referring Expression
(GREx) methods to address the challenges of real-world complexity, along with
related tasks and practical applications. Extensive performance comparisons on
standard benchmarks are also provided. We continually track related works at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个评估语义对应在恶劣条件下鲁棒性的新基准，发现现有方法在挑战性场景中表现下降，并探讨了大规模视觉模型和任务特定设计的作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语义对应是计算机视觉中的基础任务，但其在恶劣条件下的鲁棒性研究不足，因此需要建立新基准以填补这一空白。

Method: 构建包含14种常见成像问题的数据集，评估现有语义对应方法和大规模视觉模型（如DINO和Stable Diffusion）的鲁棒性。

Result: 现有方法在恶劣条件下性能显著下降；大规模视觉模型提升鲁棒性，但微调会降低相对鲁棒性；DINO优于Stable Diffusion，融合两者可提升绝对鲁棒性；通用数据增强无效。

Conclusion: 任务特定设计对提升语义对应鲁棒性至关重要，大规模视觉模型和融合策略是潜在改进方向。

Abstract: Semantic correspondence aims to identify semantically meaningful
relationships between different images and is a fundamental challenge in
computer vision. It forms the foundation for numerous tasks such as 3D
reconstruction, object tracking, and image editing. With the progress of
large-scale vision models, semantic correspondence has achieved remarkable
performance in controlled and high-quality conditions. However, the robustness
of semantic correspondence in challenging scenarios is much less investigated.
In this work, we establish a novel benchmark for evaluating semantic
correspondence in adverse conditions. The benchmark dataset comprises 14
distinct challenging scenarios that reflect commonly encountered imaging
issues, including geometric distortion, image blurring, digital artifacts, and
environmental occlusion. Through extensive evaluations, we provide several key
insights into the robustness of semantic correspondence approaches: (1) All
existing methods suffer from noticeable performance drops under adverse
conditions; (2) Using large-scale vision models can enhance overall robustness,
but fine-tuning on these models leads to a decline in relative robustness; (3)
The DINO model outperforms the Stable Diffusion in relative robustness, and
their fusion achieves better absolute robustness; Moreover, We evaluate common
robustness enhancement strategies for semantic correspondence and find that
general data augmentations are ineffective, highlighting the need for
task-specific designs. These results are consistent across both our dataset and
real-world benchmarks.

Motivation: 驾驶员疲劳是交通事故的主要原因之一，但在真实场景中，由于数据的分散性和多样性，准确检测疲劳仍具挑战性。

Method: 开发了空间自注意力机制（SSA）与LSTM结合的网络，并采用梯度相似性比较（GSC）支持联邦学习，同时设计了自动化视频数据处理工具。

Result: 在联邦学习设置下，检测准确率达到89.9%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法有效处理了真实数据的多样性，有望应用于智能交通系统以提高道路安全。

Abstract: Driver drowsiness is one of the main causes of road accidents and is
recognized as a leading contributor to traffic-related fatalities. However,
detecting drowsiness accurately remains a challenging task, especially in
real-world settings where facial data from different individuals is
decentralized and highly diverse. In this paper, we propose a novel framework
for drowsiness detection that is designed to work effectively with
heterogeneous and decentralized data. Our approach develops a new Spatial
Self-Attention (SSA) mechanism integrated with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
network to better extract key facial features and improve detection
performance. To support federated learning, we employ a Gradient Similarity
Comparison (GSC) that selects the most relevant trained models from different
operators before aggregation. This improves the accuracy and robustness of the
global model while preserving user privacy. We also develop a customized tool
that automatically processes video data by extracting frames, detecting and
cropping faces, and applying data augmentation techniques such as rotation,
flipping, brightness adjustment, and zooming. Experimental results show that
our framework achieves a detection accuracy of 89.9% in the federated learning
settings, outperforming existing methods under various deployment scenarios.
The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in handling
real-world data variability and highlight its potential for deployment in
intelligent transportation systems to enhance road safety through early and
reliable drowsiness detection.

Conclusion: TITAN-Guide不仅降低了内存需求，还在多个扩散引导基准测试中表现出色。

Abstract: In the recent development of conditional diffusion models still require heavy
supervised fine-tuning for performing control on a category of tasks.
Training-free conditioning via guidance with off-the-shelf models is a
favorable alternative to avoid further fine-tuning on the base model. However,
the existing training-free guidance frameworks either have heavy memory
requirements or offer sub-optimal control due to rough estimation. These
shortcomings limit the applicability to control diffusion models that require
intense computation, such as Text-to-Video (T2V) diffusion models. In this
work, we propose Taming Inference Time Alignment for Guided Text-to-Video
Diffusion Model, so-called TITAN-Guide, which overcomes memory space issues,
and provides more optimal control in the guidance process compared to the
counterparts. In particular, we develop an efficient method for optimizing
diffusion latents without backpropagation from a discriminative guiding model.
In particular, we study forward gradient descents for guided diffusion tasks
with various options on directional directives. In our experiments, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in efficiently managing memory
during latent optimization, while previous methods fall short. Our proposed
approach not only minimizes memory requirements but also significantly enhances
T2V performance across a range of diffusion guidance benchmarks. Code, models,

TL;DR: AniMer+扩展了AniMer框架，通过高容量的Vision Transformer和MoE设计，统一重建哺乳动物和鸟类。利用扩散模型生成合成数据，解决了3D数据稀缺问题，并在多个基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 统一理解不同动态对象的需求，以及生物研究中准确估计动物姿态和形状的重要性。

Method: 采用高容量、家族感知的Vision Transformer，结合MoE设计，并利用扩散模型生成合成数据集。

Result: 在41.3k哺乳动物和12.4k鸟类图像上训练，性能优于现有方法，尤其在Animal Kingdom数据集上表现突出。

Conclusion: AniMer+的网络架构和合成数据有效提升了实际应用性能，解决了数据稀缺问题。

Abstract: In the era of foundation models, achieving a unified understanding of
different dynamic objects through a single network has the potential to empower
stronger spatial intelligence. Moreover, accurate estimation of animal pose and
shape across diverse species is essential for quantitative analysis in
biological research. However, this topic remains underexplored due to the
limited network capacity of previous methods and the scarcity of comprehensive
multi-species datasets. To address these limitations, we introduce AniMer+, an
extended version of our scalable AniMer framework. In this paper, we focus on a
unified approach for reconstructing mammals (mammalia) and birds (aves). A key
innovation of AniMer+ is its high-capacity, family-aware Vision Transformer
(ViT) incorporating a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) design. Its architecture
partitions network layers into taxa-specific components (for mammalia and aves)
and taxa-shared components, enabling efficient learning of both distinct and
common anatomical features within a single model. To overcome the critical
shortage of 3D training data, especially for birds, we introduce a
diffusion-based conditional image generation pipeline. This pipeline produces
two large-scale synthetic datasets: CtrlAni3D for quadrupeds and CtrlAVES3D for
birds. To note, CtrlAVES3D is the first large-scale, 3D-annotated dataset for
birds, which is crucial for resolving single-view depth ambiguities. Trained on
an aggregated collection of 41.3k mammalian and 12.4k avian images (combining
real and synthetic data), our method demonstrates superior performance over
existing approaches across a wide range of benchmarks, including the
challenging out-of-domain Animal Kingdom dataset. Ablation studies confirm the
effectiveness of both our novel network architecture and the generated
synthetic datasets in enhancing real-world application performance.

Conclusion: 该方法为多视角行人视频生成提供了鲁棒且通用的解决方案，适用于数据增强和场景模拟。

Abstract: Pedestrian detection models in autonomous driving systems often lack
robustness due to insufficient representation of dangerous pedestrian scenarios
in training datasets. To address this limitation, we present a novel framework
for controllable pedestrian video editing in multi-view driving scenarios by
integrating video inpainting and human motion control techniques. Our approach
begins by identifying pedestrian regions of interest across multiple camera
views, expanding detection bounding boxes with a fixed ratio, and resizing and
stitching these regions into a unified canvas while preserving cross-view
spatial relationships. A binary mask is then applied to designate the editable
area, within which pedestrian editing is guided by pose sequence control
conditions. This enables flexible editing functionalities, including pedestrian
insertion, replacement, and removal. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
framework achieves high-quality pedestrian editing with strong visual realism,
spatiotemporal coherence, and cross-view consistency. These results establish
the proposed method as a robust and versatile solution for multi-view
pedestrian video generation, with broad potential for applications in data
augmentation and scenario simulation in autonomous driving.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种两阶段低光图像增强方法，利用事件相机的高动态范围和低延迟特性，通过解耦增强流程为可见性恢复和结构细化，结合动态对齐和对比损失，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于事件的方法未能充分利用模态优势，限制了性能提升。

Method: 将增强流程分为可见性恢复（基于傅里叶空间的振幅-相位纠缠网络）和结构细化（动态对齐融合策略），并引入对比损失。

Result: 实验表明，该方法优于现有最优模型。

Conclusion: 通过解耦增强流程和动态对齐策略，有效提升了低光图像增强的性能。

Abstract: The event camera, benefiting from its high dynamic range and low latency,
provides performance gain for low-light image enhancement. Unlike frame-based
cameras, it records intensity changes with extremely high temporal resolution,
capturing sufficient structure information. Currently, existing event-based
methods feed a frame and events directly into a single model without fully
exploiting modality-specific advantages, which limits their performance.
Therefore, by analyzing the role of each sensing modality, the enhancement
pipeline is decoupled into two stages: visibility restoration and structure
refinement. In the first stage, we design a visibility restoration network with
amplitude-phase entanglement by rethinking the relationship between amplitude
and phase components in Fourier space. In the second stage, a fusion strategy
with dynamic alignment is proposed to mitigate the spatial mismatch caused by
the temporal resolution discrepancy between two sensing modalities, aiming to
refine the structure information of the image enhanced by the visibility
restoration network. In addition, we utilize spatial-frequency interpolation to
simulate negative samples with diverse illumination, noise and artifact
degradations, thereby developing a contrastive loss that encourages the model
to learn discriminative representations. Experiments demonstrate that the
proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art models.

specialized architectures. Furthermore, we introduce CSFormula, a large-scale
and challenging dataset that encompasses multidisciplinary and structurally
complex formulas at the line, paragraph, and page levels. Through
straightforward supervised fine-tuning, our approach achieves state-of-the-art
performance across a variety of styles, scientific domains, and complex
layouts. Experimental results demonstrate that our method not only surpasses
specialized models in terms of accuracy and robustness, but also establishes a
new paradigm for the automated understanding of complex scientific documents.

Motivation: CSP工厂的航拍图像具有高反射性和领域特定元素，通用数据集训练的模型难以直接应用，且真实数据标注成本高。

Result: 预训练模型在AerialCSP上显著提升真实缺陷检测效果，尤其是对小而罕见的缺陷。

Conclusion: AerialCSP为CSP相关视觉任务提供高质量合成数据，减少手动标注需求，推动工业应用快速部署。

Abstract: In the context of Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) plants, aerial images
captured by drones present a unique set of challenges. Unlike urban or natural
landscapes commonly found in existing datasets, solar fields contain highly
reflective surfaces, and domain-specific elements that are uncommon in
traditional computer vision benchmarks. As a result, machine learning models
trained on generic datasets struggle to generalize to this setting without
extensive retraining and large volumes of annotated data. However, collecting
and labeling such data is costly and time-consuming, making it impractical for
rapid deployment in industrial applications.
  To address this issue, we propose a novel approach: the creation of
AerialCSP, a virtual dataset that simulates aerial imagery of CSP plants. By
generating synthetic data that closely mimic real-world conditions, our
objective is to facilitate pretraining of models before deployment,
significantly reducing the need for extensive manual labeling. Our main
contributions are threefold: (1) we introduce AerialCSP, a high-quality
synthetic dataset for aerial inspection of CSP plants, providing annotated data
for object detection and image segmentation; (2) we benchmark multiple models
on AerialCSP, establishing a baseline for CSP-related vision tasks; and (3) we
demonstrate that pretraining on AerialCSP significantly improves real-world
fault detection, particularly for rare and small defects, reducing the need for
extensive manual labeling. AerialCSP is made publicly available at

Conclusion: GV-VAD框架通过合成视频数据增强和优化训练策略，显著提升了视频异常检测的性能。

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) plays a critical role in public safety
applications such as intelligent surveillance. However, the rarity,
unpredictability, and high annotation cost of real-world anomalies make it
difficult to scale VAD datasets, which limits the performance and
generalization ability of existing models. To address this challenge, we
propose a generative video-enhanced weakly-supervised video anomaly detection
(GV-VAD) framework that leverages text-conditioned video generation models to
produce semantically controllable and physically plausible synthetic videos.
These virtual videos are used to augment training data at low cost. In
addition, a synthetic sample loss scaling strategy is utilized to control the
influence of generated synthetic samples for efficient training. The
experiments show that the proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art
methods on UCF-Crime datasets. The code is available at

Result: 在WayMoCo数据集上，运动-上下文检索准确率比现有方法高27.5%。

Conclusion: 该方法为自动驾驶系统提供了高效的人类行为检索工具，支持多样化的场景评估。

Abstract: Autonomous driving systems must operate reliably in safety-critical
scenarios, particularly those involving unusual or complex behavior by
Vulnerable Road Users (VRUs). Identifying these edge cases in driving datasets
is essential for robust evaluation and generalization, but retrieving such rare
human behavior scenarios within the long tail of large-scale datasets is
challenging. To support targeted evaluation of autonomous driving systems in
diverse, human-centered scenarios, we propose a novel context-aware motion
retrieval framework. Our method combines Skinned Multi-Person Linear
(SMPL)-based motion sequences and corresponding video frames before encoding
them into a shared multimodal embedding space aligned with natural language.
Our approach enables the scalable retrieval of human behavior and their context
through text queries. This work also introduces our dataset WayMoCo, an
extension of the Waymo Open Dataset. It contains automatically labeled motion
and scene context descriptions derived from generated pseudo-ground-truth SMPL
sequences and corresponding image data. Our approach outperforms
state-of-the-art models by up to 27.5% accuracy in motion-context retrieval,
when evaluated on the WayMoCo dataset.

Motivation: 现有采样引导方法（如CFG和AG）无法有效平衡目标分布对齐与文本编辑能力，需要一种更优的解决方案。

Method: 利用未学习弱模型和空文本提示条件，动态控制未学习程度，通过权重插值实现平衡。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能提升文本对齐和目标分布保真度，且无需额外计算开销。

Conclusion: 提出的个性化引导方法简单有效，能无缝集成多种微调策略，实现更优的平衡。

Abstract: Personalizing text-to-image diffusion models is crucial for adapting the
pre-trained models to specific target concepts, enabling diverse image
generation. However, fine-tuning with few images introduces an inherent
trade-off between aligning with the target distribution (e.g., subject
fidelity) and preserving the broad knowledge of the original model (e.g., text
editability). Existing sampling guidance methods, such as classifier-free
guidance (CFG) and autoguidance (AG), fail to effectively guide the output
toward well-balanced space: CFG restricts the adaptation to the target
distribution, while AG compromises text alignment. To address these
limitations, we propose personalization guidance, a simple yet effective method
leveraging an unlearned weak model conditioned on a null text prompt. Moreover,
our method dynamically controls the extent of unlearning in a weak model
through weight interpolation between pre-trained and fine-tuned models during
inference. Unlike existing guidance methods, which depend solely on guidance
scales, our method explicitly steers the outputs toward a balanced latent space
without additional computational overhead. Experimental results demonstrate
that our proposed guidance can improve text alignment and target distribution
fidelity, integrating seamlessly with various fine-tuning strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法难以充分建模3D环境与目标图像之间的几何关系，导致导航效率低下。

Method: 采用增量式3D高斯表示，结合单目预测和几何信息匹配，分阶段实现目标定位。

Result: IGL-Nav在多种实验配置下显著优于现有方法，并能处理更具挑战性的自由视角图像目标导航。

Conclusion: IGL-Nav为高效、3D感知的图像目标导航提供了创新解决方案，适用于实际机器人平台。

Abstract: Visual navigation with an image as goal is a fundamental and challenging
problem. Conventional methods either rely on end-to-end RL learning or
modular-based policy with topological graph or BEV map as memory, which cannot
fully model the geometric relationship between the explored 3D environment and
the goal image. In order to efficiently and accurately localize the goal image
in 3D space, we build our navigation system upon the renderable 3D gaussian
(3DGS) representation. However, due to the computational intensity of 3DGS
optimization and the large search space of 6-DoF camera pose, directly
leveraging 3DGS for image localization during agent exploration process is
prohibitively inefficient. To this end, we propose IGL-Nav, an Incremental 3D
Gaussian Localization framework for efficient and 3D-aware image-goal
navigation. Specifically, we incrementally update the scene representation as
new images arrive with feed-forward monocular prediction. Then we coarsely
localize the goal by leveraging the geometric information for discrete space
matching, which can be equivalent to efficient 3D convolution. When the agent
is close to the goal, we finally solve the fine target pose with optimization
via differentiable rendering. The proposed IGL-Nav outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods by a large margin across diverse experimental
configurations. It can also handle the more challenging free-view image-goal
setting and be deployed on real-world robotic platform using a cellphone to
capture goal image at arbitrary pose. Project page:

Abstract: This paper introduces a practical and accurate calibration method for camera
spectral sensitivity using a diffraction grating. Accurate calibration of
camera spectral sensitivity is crucial for various computer vision tasks,
including color correction, illumination estimation, and material analysis.
Unlike existing approaches that require specialized narrow-band filters or

uncalibrated diffraction grating sheet, readily available off-the-shelf. By
capturing images of the direct illumination and its diffracted pattern through
the grating sheet, our method estimates both the camera spectral sensitivity

prompts, and a VisionReasoner, a large vision-language model (LVLM) responsible
for final inference. The framework is fully automated, modular, and
training-free, enabling generalization across classification, question
answering, and free-form generation tasks involving one or multiple input
images. We evaluate our method on 18 diverse datasets from the 2025 MIRAGE
Challenge (Track A), covering a broad spectrum of visual reasoning tasks
including document QA, visual comparison, dialogue-based understanding, and
scene-level inference. Our results demonstrate that LVLMs can effectively
reason over multiple images when guided by informative prompts. Notably, Claude
3.7 achieves near-ceiling performance on challenging tasks such as TQA (99.13%
accuracy), DocVQA (96.87%), and MMCoQA (75.28 ROUGE-L). We also explore how
design choices-such as model selection, shot count, and input length-influence
the reasoning performance of different LVLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种速度引导的可学习卡尔曼滤波器（SG-LKF），通过动态适应不确定性建模，显著提高了多目标跟踪在高动态场景中的稳定性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多目标跟踪方法依赖静态坐标变换，忽略了车辆速度对观测噪声和参考帧变化的影响，导致在高动态场景中跟踪性能下降。

Method: 提出了SG-LKF和MotionScaleNet（MSNet），结合自监督轨迹一致性损失，动态调整不确定性建模。

Result: 在KITTI 2D MOT和3D MOT以及nuScenes 3D MOT上表现优异，排名第一或显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: SG-LKF通过动态适应车辆速度，显著提升了多目标跟踪在高动态场景中的性能。

Abstract: Multi-object tracking (MOT) enables autonomous vehicles to continuously
perceive dynamic objects, supplying essential temporal cues for prediction,
behavior understanding, and safe planning. However, conventional
tracking-by-detection methods typically rely on static coordinate
transformations based on ego-vehicle poses, disregarding ego-vehicle
speed-induced variations in observation noise and reference frame changes,
which degrades tracking stability and accuracy in dynamic, high-speed
scenarios. In this paper, we investigate the critical role of ego-vehicle speed
in MOT and propose a Speed-Guided Learnable Kalman Filter (SG-LKF) that
dynamically adapts uncertainty modeling to ego-vehicle speed, significantly
improving stability and accuracy in highly dynamic scenarios. Central to SG-LKF
is MotionScaleNet (MSNet), a decoupled token-mixing and channel-mixing MLP that
adaptively predicts key parameters of SG-LKF. To enhance inter-frame
association and trajectory continuity, we introduce a self-supervised
trajectory consistency loss jointly optimized with semantic and positional
constraints. Extensive experiments show that SG-LKF ranks first among all
vision-based methods on KITTI 2D MOT with 79.59% HOTA, delivers strong results
on KITTI 3D MOT with 82.03% HOTA, and outperforms SimpleTrack by 2.2% AMOTA on
nuScenes 3D MOT.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种高效的协作感知方法CoST，通过将多智能体和多时间观测统一到时空空间中，实现了高效的特征传输和优越的特征融合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统方法中多智能体融合和多时间融合分离的问题，提升协作感知的效率和准确性。

Method: 提出协作时空变换器（CoST），将多智能体和多时间观测统一到一个时空空间中进行同时融合。

Result: CoST在效率和准确性上均有提升，且兼容多数现有方法，减少传输带宽需求。

Conclusion: CoST通过统一的时空融合，显著提升了协作感知的性能和效率。

Abstract: Collaborative perception shares information among different agents and helps
solving problems that individual agents may face, e.g., occlusions and small
sensing range. Prior methods usually separate the multi-agent fusion and
multi-time fusion into two consecutive steps. In contrast, this paper proposes
an efficient collaborative perception that aggregates the observations from
different agents (space) and different times into a unified spatio-temporal
space simultanesouly. The unified spatio-temporal space brings two benefits,
i.e., efficient feature transmission and superior feature fusion. 1) Efficient
feature transmission: each static object yields a single observation in the
spatial temporal space, and thus only requires transmission only once (whereas
prior methods re-transmit all the object features multiple times). 2) superior
feature fusion: merging the multi-agent and multi-time fusion into a unified
spatial-temporal aggregation enables a more holistic perspective, thereby
enhancing perception performance in challenging scenarios. Consequently, our
Collaborative perception with Spatio-temporal Transformer (CoST) gains
improvement in both efficiency and accuracy. Notably, CoST is not tied to any
specific method and is compatible with a majority of previous methods,
enhancing their accuracy while reducing the transmission bandwidth.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于机器学习的蜂蜜植物来源自动分类方法，包括数据集准备、特征提取和分类三个步骤，使用LDA和SVM/KNN模型，在标准数据集上取得了高准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决蜂蜜植物来源自动分类问题，提高分类准确性和效率。

Method: 1. 数据集准备：采用类转换方法增强类别可分性；2. 特征提取：使用LDA降维；3. 分类：采用SVM和KNN模型。

Result: 在标准HSI数据集上，分类准确率分别达到95.13%（图像）和92.80%（实例）。

Conclusion: 该方法在蜂蜜植物来源分类中表现优异，达到了当前最佳水平。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a machine learning-based method for automatically
classifying honey botanical origins. Dataset preparation, feature extraction,
and classification are the three main steps of the proposed method. We use a
class transformation method in the dataset preparation phase to maximize the
separability across classes. The feature extraction phase employs the Linear
Discriminant Analysis (LDA) technique for extracting relevant features and
reducing the number of dimensions. In the classification phase, we use Support
Vector Machines (SVM) and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) models to classify the
extracted features of honey samples into their botanical origins. We evaluate
our system using a standard honey hyperspectral imaging (HSI) dataset.
Experimental findings demonstrate that the proposed system produces
state-of-the-art results on this dataset, achieving the highest classification
accuracy of 95.13% for hyperspectral image-based classification and 92.80% for
hyperspectral instance-based classification.

TL;DR: SparseRecon提出了一种新的稀疏视图神经隐式重建方法，通过特征一致性和不确定性引导的深度约束提升重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有稀疏视图重建方法（泛化型和过拟合型）在未见视图上泛化能力差或重建质量受限。

Method: 结合基于体积渲染的特征一致性损失和不确定性引导的深度约束，优化神经隐式场。

Result: 实验表明，SparseRecon在稀疏视图输入下优于现有方法，尤其在小重叠视图场景中表现优异。

Conclusion: SparseRecon通过特征一致性和深度约束，显著提升了稀疏视图重建的完整性和细节恢复能力。

Abstract: Surface reconstruction from sparse views aims to reconstruct a 3D shape or
scene from few RGB images. The latest methods are either generalization-based
or overfitting-based. However, the generalization-based methods do not
generalize well on views that were unseen during training, while the
reconstruction quality of overfitting-based methods is still limited by the
limited geometry clues. To address this issue, we propose SparseRecon, a novel
neural implicit reconstruction method for sparse views with volume
rendering-based feature consistency and uncertainty-guided depth constraint.
Firstly, we introduce a feature consistency loss across views to constrain the
neural implicit field. This design alleviates the ambiguity caused by
insufficient consistency information of views and ensures completeness and
smoothness in the reconstruction results. Secondly, we employ an
uncertainty-guided depth constraint to back up the feature consistency loss in
areas with occlusion and insignificant features, which recovers geometry
details for better reconstruction quality. Experimental results demonstrate
that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, which can produce
high-quality geometry with sparse-view input, especially in the scenarios with
small overlapping views. Project page: https://hanl2010.github.io/SparseRecon/.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Representation Shift的训练无关、模型无关的度量方法，用于衡量每个token表示的变化程度，从而在不依赖注意力图的情况下实现token压缩，并与FlashAttention兼容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着任务复杂度的增加，Transformer模型的计算成本（尤其是自注意力的二次成本）和GPU内存访问开销显著增加，现有token压缩方法因依赖注意力图而与FlashAttention不兼容。

Method: 提出Representation Shift度量方法，通过测量token表示的变化程度来实现token压缩，无需注意力图或重新训练。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在视频-文本检索和视频问答任务中分别实现了5.5%和4.4%的显著加速。

Conclusion: Representation Shift是一种高效且通用的token压缩方法，兼容FlashAttention，适用于多种模型。

Abstract: Transformers have demonstrated remarkable success across vision, language,
and video. Yet, increasing task complexity has led to larger models and more
tokens, raising the quadratic cost of self-attention and the overhead of GPU
memory access. To reduce the computation cost of self-attention, prior work has
proposed token compression techniques that drop redundant or less informative
tokens. Meanwhile, fused attention kernels such as FlashAttention have been
developed to alleviate memory overhead by avoiding attention map construction
and its associated I/O to HBM. This, however, makes it incompatible with most
training-free token compression methods, which rely on attention maps to
determine token importance. Here, we propose Representation Shift, a
training-free, model-agnostic metric that measures the degree of change in each
token's representation. This seamlessly integrates token compression with
FlashAttention, without attention maps or retraining. Our method further
generalizes beyond Transformers to CNNs and state space models. Extensive
experiments show that Representation Shift enables effective token compression
compatible with FlashAttention, yielding significant speedups of up to 5.5% and
4.4% in video-text retrieval and video QA, respectively. Code is available at

Abstract: Video-based long-term action anticipation is crucial for early risk detection
in areas such as automated driving and robotics. Conventional approaches
extract features from past actions using encoders and predict future events
with decoders, which limits performance due to their unidirectional nature.
These methods struggle to capture semantically distinct sub-actions within a

forward prediction with backward prediction using a large language model.
Experimental results on Ego4D demonstrate that BiAnt improves performance in
terms of edit distance compared to baseline methods.

Abstract: Weld defect detection is crucial for ensuring the safety and reliability of
piping systems in the oil and gas industry, especially in challenging marine
and offshore environments. Traditional non-destructive testing (NDT) methods
often fail to detect subtle or internal defects, leading to potential failures
and costly downtime. Furthermore, existing neural network-based approaches for
defect classification frequently rely on arbitrarily selected pretrained
architectures and lack interpretability, raising safety concerns for
deployment. To address these challenges, this paper introduces
``Adapt-WeldNet", an adaptive framework for welding defect detection that
systematically evaluates various pre-trained architectures, transfer learning
strategies, and adaptive optimizers to identify the best-performing model and
hyperparameters, optimizing defect detection and providing actionable insights.
Additionally, a novel Defect Detection Interpretability Analysis (DDIA)
framework is proposed to enhance system transparency. DDIA employs Explainable
AI (XAI) techniques, such as Grad-CAM and LIME, alongside domain-specific
evaluations validated by certified ASNT NDE Level II professionals.
Incorporating a Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) approach and aligning with the
principles of Trustworthy AI, DDIA ensures the reliability, fairness, and
accountability of the defect detection system, fostering confidence in
automated decisions through expert validation. By improving both performance
and interpretability, this work enhances trust, safety, and reliability in
welding defect detection systems, supporting critical operations in offshore
and marine environments.

Motivation: 空间转录组学成本高且技术复杂，限制了临床应用。从常规病理图像预测基因表达是一种实用替代方案，但现有ViT模型性能不足。

Method: 提出$MV_{Hybrid}$架构，结合SSMs和ViT，利用负实特征值初始化SSMs以增强低频模式捕捉能力。

Result: 在LOSO评估中，$MV_{Hybrid}$比最佳ViT模型相关性提高57%，性能下降减少43%，且在下游任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: $MV_{Hybrid}$是一种有前景的下一代病理视觉基础模型架构。

Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics reveals gene expression patterns within tissue
context, enabling precision oncology applications such as treatment response
prediction, but its high cost and technical complexity limit clinical adoption.
Predicting spatial gene expression (biomarkers) from routine histopathology
images offers a practical alternative, yet current vision foundation models
(VFMs) in pathology based on Vision Transformer (ViT) backbones perform below
clinical standards. Given that VFMs are already trained on millions of diverse
whole slide images, we hypothesize that architectural innovations beyond ViTs
may better capture the low-frequency, subtle morphological patterns correlating
with molecular phenotypes. By demonstrating that state space models initialized
with negative real eigenvalues exhibit strong low-frequency bias, we introduce
$MV_{Hybrid}$, a hybrid backbone architecture combining state space models
(SSMs) with ViT. We compare five other different backbone architectures for
pathology VFMs, all pretrained on identical colorectal cancer datasets using
the DINOv2 self-supervised learning method. We evaluate all pretrained models
using both random split and leave-one-study-out (LOSO) settings of the same
biomarker dataset. In LOSO evaluation, $MV_{Hybrid}$ achieves 57% higher
correlation than the best-performing ViT and shows 43% smaller performance
degradation compared to random split in gene expression prediction,
demonstrating superior performance and robustness, respectively. Furthermore,
$MV_{Hybrid}$ shows equal or better downstream performance in classification,
patch retrieval, and survival prediction tasks compared to that of ViT, showing
its promise as a next-generation pathology VFM backbone. Our code is publicly
available at: https://github.com/deepnoid-ai/MVHybrid.

Conclusion: Cued-Agent通过多智能体协作有效解决了CS识别中的多模态融合和数据限制问题，性能显著提升。

Abstract: Cued Speech (CS) is a visual communication system that combines lip-reading
with hand coding to facilitate communication for individuals with hearing
impairments. Automatic CS Recognition (ACSR) aims to convert CS hand gestures
and lip movements into text via AI-driven methods. Traditionally, the temporal
asynchrony between hand and lip movements requires the design of complex
modules to facilitate effective multimodal fusion. However, constrained by
limited data availability, current methods demonstrate insufficient capacity
for adequately training these fusion mechanisms, resulting in suboptimal
performance. Recently, multi-agent systems have shown promising capabilities in
handling complex tasks with limited data availability. To this end, we propose
the first collaborative multi-agent system for ACSR, named Cued-Agent. It
integrates four specialized sub-agents: a Multimodal Large Language Model-based
Hand Recognition agent that employs keyframe screening and CS expert prompt
strategies to decode hand movements, a pretrained Transformer-based Lip
Recognition agent that extracts lip features from the input video, a Hand
Prompt Decoding agent that dynamically integrates hand prompts with lip
features during inference in a training-free manner, and a Self-Correction
Phoneme-to-Word agent that enables post-process and end-to-end conversion from
phoneme sequences to natural language sentences for the first time through
semantic refinement. To support this study, we expand the existing Mandarin CS
dataset by collecting data from eight hearing-impaired cuers, establishing a
mixed dataset of fourteen subjects. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
Cued-Agent performs superbly in both normal and hearing-impaired scenarios
compared with state-of-the-art methods. The implementation is available at

Result: 在少样本学习、基础到新类泛化和数据高效学习中，DAPT在多个基准测试中表现优异。

Conclusion: DAPT通过解耦与对齐策略有效解决了信息不对称问题，显著提升了视觉语言模型的性能。

Abstract: Prompt tuning (PT), as an emerging resource-efficient fine-tuning paradigm,
has showcased remarkable effectiveness in improving the task-specific
transferability of vision-language models. This paper delves into a previously
overlooked information asymmetry issue in PT, where the visual modality mostly
conveys more context than the object-oriented textual modality.
Correspondingly, coarsely aligning these two modalities could result in the
biased attention, driving the model to merely focus on the context area. To
address this, we propose DAPT, an effective PT framework based on an intuitive
decouple-before-align concept. First, we propose to explicitly decouple the
visual modality into the foreground and background representation via
exploiting coarse-and-fine visual segmenting cues, and then both of these
decoupled patterns are aligned with the original foreground texts and the
hand-crafted background classes, thereby symmetrically strengthening the modal
alignment. To further enhance the visual concentration, we propose a visual
pull-push regularization tailored for the foreground-background patterns,
directing the original visual representation towards unbiased attention on the
region-of-interest object. We demonstrate the power of architecture-free DAPT
through few-shot learning, base-to-novel generalization, and data-efficient
learning, all of which yield superior performance across prevailing benchmarks.
Our code will be released at https://github.com/Ferenas/DAPT.

Conclusion: 通过整合互补特征，该方法能有效检测多种伪造视频。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of diffusion-based video generation models has led to
increasingly realistic synthetic content, presenting new challenges for video
forgery detection. Existing methods often struggle to capture fine-grained
temporal inconsistencies, particularly in AI-generated videos with high visual
fidelity and coherent motion. In this work, we propose a detection framework
that leverages spatial-temporal consistency by combining RGB appearance
features with optical flow residuals. The model adopts a dual-branch
architecture, where one branch analyzes RGB frames to detect appearance-level
artifacts, while the other processes flow residuals to reveal subtle motion
anomalies caused by imperfect temporal synthesis. By integrating these
complementary features, the proposed method effectively detects a wide range of
forged videos. Extensive experiments on text-to-video and image-to-video tasks
across ten diverse generative models demonstrate the robustness and strong
generalization ability of the proposed approach.

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled impressive
generalization across diverse video understanding tasks under zero-shot
settings. However, their capabilities in high-stakes industrial domains-where
recognizing both routine operations and safety-critical anomalies is
essential-remain largely underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce
iSafetyBench, a new video-language benchmark specifically designed to evaluate
model performance in industrial environments across both normal and hazardous
scenarios. iSafetyBench comprises 1,100 video clips sourced from real-world
industrial settings, annotated with open-vocabulary, multi-label action tags
spanning 98 routine and 67 hazardous action categories. Each clip is paired
with multiple-choice questions for both single-label and multi-label
evaluation, enabling fine-grained assessment of VLMs in both standard and
safety-critical contexts. We evaluate eight state-of-the-art video-language
models under zero-shot conditions. Despite their strong performance on existing
video benchmarks, these models struggle with iSafetyBench-particularly in
recognizing hazardous activities and in multi-label scenarios. Our results
reveal significant performance gaps, underscoring the need for more robust,
safety-aware multimodal models for industrial applications. iSafetyBench
provides a first-of-its-kind testbed to drive progress in this direction. The

Motivation: 大气湍流导致的几何失真和模糊问题严重影响长距离动态场景视频质量，现有方法难以恢复边缘细节和消除混合失真。

Method: 提出DEI量化视频动态强度，并设计PMR框架，包括去倾斜、动态区域增强和去模糊三个阶段，采用轻量级主干和分阶段联合训练。

Conclusion: PMR框架在视频恢复中表现出高效性和高质量，代码和数据集将公开。

Abstract: Geometric distortions and blurring caused by atmospheric turbulence degrade
the quality of long-range dynamic scene videos. Existing methods struggle with
restoring edge details and eliminating mixed distortions, especially under
conditions of strong turbulence and complex dynamics. To address these
challenges, we introduce a Dynamic Efficiency Index ($DEI$), which combines
turbulence intensity, optical flow, and proportions of dynamic regions to
accurately quantify video dynamic intensity under varying turbulence conditions
and provide a high-dynamic turbulence training dataset. Additionally, we
propose a Physical Model-Driven Multi-Stage Video Restoration ($PMR$) framework
that consists of three stages: \textbf{de-tilting} for geometric stabilization,
\textbf{motion segmentation enhancement} for dynamic region refinement, and
\textbf{de-blurring} for quality restoration. $PMR$ employs lightweight
backbones and stage-wise joint training to ensure both efficiency and high
restoration quality. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method
effectively suppresses motion trailing artifacts, restores edge details and
exhibits strong generalization capability, especially in real-world scenarios
characterized by high-turbulence and complex dynamics. We will make the code
and datasets openly available.

Conclusion: Sortblock为扩散生成模型提供了一种高效通用的加速方案。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have demonstrated remarkable generative
capabilities, particularly benefiting from Transformer architectures that
enhance visual and artistic fidelity. However, their inherently sequential
denoising process results in high inference latency, limiting their deployment
in real-time scenarios. Existing training-free acceleration approaches
typically reuse intermediate features at fixed timesteps or layers, overlooking
the evolving semantic focus across denoising stages and Transformer blocks.To
address this, we propose Sortblock, a training-free inference acceleration
framework that dynamically caches block-wise features based on their similarity
across adjacent timesteps. By ranking the evolution of residuals, Sortblock
adaptively determines a recomputation ratio, selectively skipping redundant
computations while preserving generation quality. Furthermore, we incorporate a
lightweight linear prediction mechanism to reduce accumulated errors in skipped
blocks.Extensive experiments across various tasks and DiT architectures
demonstrate that Sortblock achieves over 2$\times$ inference speedup with
minimal degradation in output quality, offering an effective and generalizable
solution for accelerating diffusion-based generative models.

*Junyu Chen,Dongyun Zou,Wenkun He,Junsong Chen,Enze Xie,Song Han,Han Cai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DC-AE 1.5是一种新型深度压缩自编码器，用于高分辨率扩散模型，通过结构化潜在空间和增强扩散训练解决了潜在通道增加导致的收敛慢问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 增加自编码器的潜在通道数可提高重建质量，但会导致扩散模型收敛慢，限制了潜在扩散模型的质量上限。

Method: 提出了结构化潜在空间和增强扩散训练两种创新方法，前者对潜在空间施加通道结构，后者通过额外训练目标加速收敛。

Result: DC-AE 1.5在ImageNet 512x512上比DC-AE生成质量更高且速度快4倍。

Conclusion: DC-AE 1.5通过结构化潜在空间和增强扩散训练，显著提升了扩散模型的收敛速度和生成质量。

Abstract: We present DC-AE 1.5, a new family of deep compression autoencoders for
high-resolution diffusion models. Increasing the autoencoder's latent channel
number is a highly effective approach for improving its reconstruction quality.
However, it results in slow convergence for diffusion models, leading to poorer
generation quality despite better reconstruction quality. This issue limits the
quality upper bound of latent diffusion models and hinders the employment of
autoencoders with higher spatial compression ratios. We introduce two key
innovations to address this challenge: i) Structured Latent Space, a
training-based approach to impose a desired channel-wise structure on the
latent space with front latent channels capturing object structures and latter
latent channels capturing image details; ii) Augmented Diffusion Training, an
augmented diffusion training strategy with additional diffusion training
objectives on object latent channels to accelerate convergence. With these
techniques, DC-AE 1.5 delivers faster convergence and better diffusion scaling
results than DC-AE. On ImageNet 512x512, DC-AE-1.5-f64c128 delivers better
image generation quality than DC-AE-f32c32 while being 4x faster. Code:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种视频外绘方法，通过改进判别器设计和损失函数，解决了现有方法直接应用视频修复模型时效果不佳的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频外绘的挑战在于扩展边界时保持内容一致性。现有方法仅生成背景，效果模糊，需改进。

Method: 采用视频修复模型，设计分层判别器，区分全局和局部目标，并开发专用外绘损失函数。

Result: 方法在定量和定性上均优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 提出的方法通过改进判别器和损失函数，显著提升了视频外绘的质量和一致性。

Abstract: Video outpainting presents a unique challenge of extending the borders while
maintaining consistency with the given content. In this paper, we suggest the
use of video inpainting models that excel in object flow learning and
reconstruction in outpainting rather than solely generating the background as
in existing methods. However, directly applying or fine-tuning inpainting
models to outpainting has shown to be ineffective, often leading to blurry
results. Our extensive experiments on discriminator designs reveal that a
critical component missing in the outpainting fine-tuning process is a
discriminator capable of effectively assessing the perceptual quality of the
extended areas. To tackle this limitation, we differentiate the objectives of
adversarial training into global and local goals and introduce a hierarchical
discriminator that meets both objectives. Additionally, we develop a
specialized outpainting loss function that leverages both local and global
features of the discriminator. Fine-tuning on this adversarial loss function
enhances the generator's ability to produce both visually appealing and
globally coherent outpainted scenes. Our proposed method outperforms
state-of-the-art methods both quantitatively and qualitatively. Supplementary
materials including the demo video and the code are available in SigPort.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Mamba的水下实例分割模型UIS-Mamba，通过动态树扫描（DTS）和隐藏状态弱化（HSW）模块解决水下场景的特殊挑战，实现了高性能和低计算复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下实例分割任务因水下场景的特殊性（如颜色失真和模糊边界）面临挑战，现有固定补丁扫描机制无法保持实例连续性，复杂背景也会干扰实例理解。

Method: 设计了DTS模块（动态偏移和缩放补片以保持特征连续性）和HSW模块（基于Ncut的隐藏状态弱化机制抑制背景干扰），将Mamba模型迁移至水下任务。

Result: 在UIIS和USIS10K数据集上达到最先进性能，同时保持低参数和计算复杂度。

Conclusion: UIS-Mamba通过创新模块有效解决了水下实例分割的挑战，为相关任务提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Underwater Instance Segmentation (UIS) tasks are crucial for underwater
complex scene detection. Mamba, as an emerging state space model with
inherently linear complexity and global receptive fields, is highly suitable
for processing image segmentation tasks with long sequence features. However,
due to the particularity of underwater scenes, there are many challenges in
applying Mamba to UIS. The existing fixed-patch scanning mechanism cannot
maintain the internal continuity of scanned instances in the presence of
severely underwater color distortion and blurred instance boundaries, and the
hidden state of the complex underwater background can also inhibit the
understanding of instance objects. In this work, we propose the first
Mamba-based underwater instance segmentation model UIS-Mamba, and design two
innovative modules, Dynamic Tree Scan (DTS) and Hidden State Weaken (HSW), to
migrate Mamba to the underwater task. DTS module maintains the continuity of
the internal features of the instance objects by allowing the patches to
dynamically offset and scale, thereby guiding the minimum spanning tree and
providing dynamic local receptive fields. HSW module suppresses the
interference of complex backgrounds and effectively focuses the information
flow of state propagation to the instances themselves through the Ncut-based
hidden state weakening mechanism. Experimental results show that UIS-Mamba
achieves state-of-the-art performance on both UIIS and USIS10K datasets, while
maintaining a low number of parameters and computational complexity. Code is

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合物理先验知识和多区域修复技术的新方法，用于动态场景中的遮挡物体补全，显著提升了生成结果的准确性和真实性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在动态场景中因对人类-物体交互（HOI）理解有限，难以生成合理的补全结果。

Method: 结合物理约束（如人体拓扑和接触信息），定义主次区域，并在扩散模型中采用定制化的去噪策略进行多区域修复。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在HOI场景中显著优于现有方法，且无需真实接触标注仍具鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法使机器感知更接近人类对动态环境的理解，适用于3D重建和新视角/姿态合成等任务。

Abstract: Amodal completion, which is the process of inferring the full appearance of
objects despite partial occlusions, is crucial for understanding complex
human-object interactions (HOI) in computer vision and robotics. Existing
methods, such as those that use pre-trained diffusion models, often struggle to
generate plausible completions in dynamic scenarios because they have a limited
understanding of HOI. To solve this problem, we've developed a new approach
that uses physical prior knowledge along with a specialized multi-regional
inpainting technique designed for HOI. By incorporating physical constraints
from human topology and contact information, we define two distinct regions:
the primary region, where occluded object parts are most likely to be, and the
secondary region, where occlusions are less probable. Our multi-regional
inpainting method uses customized denoising strategies across these regions
within a diffusion model. This improves the accuracy and realism of the
generated completions in both their shape and visual detail. Our experimental
results show that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods in
HOI scenarios, moving machine perception closer to a more human-like
understanding of dynamic environments. We also show that our pipeline is robust
even without ground-truth contact annotations, which broadens its applicability
to tasks like 3D reconstruction and novel view/pose synthesis.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种针对管状结构分割（TSS）的测试时适应框架TopoTTA，通过两阶段方法解决域偏移问题，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 管状结构分割对域偏移特别敏感，传统方法难以应对拓扑结构变化和局部特征差异，导致性能下降。

Method: TopoTTA包含两阶段：1）使用TopoMDCs增强拓扑表示；2）通过TopoHG生成硬样本并利用伪标签优化拓扑连续性。

Result: 在四个场景和十个数据集上的实验表明，TopoTTA平均提升了31.81%的clDice指标。

Conclusion: TopoTTA是一种有效的即插即用解决方案，适用于基于CNN的TSS模型。

Abstract: Tubular structure segmentation (TSS) is important for various applications,
such as hemodynamic analysis and route navigation. Despite significant progress
in TSS, domain shifts remain a major challenge, leading to performance
degradation in unseen target domains. Unlike other segmentation tasks, TSS is
more sensitive to domain shifts, as changes in topological structures can
compromise segmentation integrity, and variations in local features
distinguishing foreground from background (e.g., texture and contrast) may
further disrupt topological continuity. To address these challenges, we propose
Topology-enhanced Test-Time Adaptation (TopoTTA), the first test-time
adaptation framework designed specifically for TSS. TopoTTA consists of two
stages: Stage 1 adapts models to cross-domain topological discrepancies using
the proposed Topological Meta Difference Convolutions (TopoMDCs), which enhance
topological representation without altering pre-trained parameters; Stage 2
improves topological continuity by a novel Topology Hard sample Generation
(TopoHG) strategy and prediction alignment on hard samples with pseudo-labels
in the generated pseudo-break regions. Extensive experiments across four
scenarios and ten datasets demonstrate TopoTTA's effectiveness in handling
topological distribution shifts, achieving an average improvement of 31.81% in
clDice. TopoTTA also serves as a plug-and-play TTA solution for CNN-based TSS
models.

Motivation: 现有交互式抠图方法在提取边缘细节方面表现不足，而扩散模型在复杂数据建模和纹理合成方面表现出色，因此被引入以改进交互式抠图。

Method: SDMatte利用扩散模型的先验知识，将文本驱动交互能力转化为视觉提示驱动交互能力，并引入坐标嵌入和掩码自注意力机制以增强空间位置和透明度信息的敏感性。

Conclusion: SDMatte通过扩散模型和视觉提示驱动的交互能力，显著提升了交互式抠图的性能，尤其在细节处理上表现突出。

Abstract: Recent interactive matting methods have shown satisfactory performance in
capturing the primary regions of objects, but they fall short in extracting
fine-grained details in edge regions. Diffusion models trained on billions of
image-text pairs, demonstrate exceptional capability in modeling highly complex
data distributions and synthesizing realistic texture details, while exhibiting
robust text-driven interaction capabilities, making them an attractive solution
for interactive matting. To this end, we propose SDMatte, a diffusion-driven
interactive matting model, with three key contributions. First, we exploit the
powerful priors of diffusion models and transform the text-driven interaction
capability into visual prompt-driven interaction capability to enable
interactive matting. Second, we integrate coordinate embeddings of visual
prompts and opacity embeddings of target objects into U-Net, enhancing
SDMatte's sensitivity to spatial position information and opacity information.
Third, we propose a masked self-attention mechanism that enables the model to
focus on areas specified by visual prompts, leading to better performance.
Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate the superior performance
of our method, validating its effectiveness in interactive matting. Our code
and model are available at https://github.com/vivoCameraResearch/SDMatte.

TL;DR: AutoDebias是一个自动识别并减少T2I模型中社会偏见的框架，无需预先知道具体偏见类型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: T2I模型常表现出未提及的社会偏见（如性别或种族刻板印象），现有方法难以处理复杂或重叠的偏见。

Method: 利用视觉语言模型检测偏见模式，生成包容性提示作为公平指南，并通过CLIP引导训练减少偏见。

Result: 在25种偏见场景中，AutoDebias准确检测91.6%的偏见，将偏见输出从90%降至可忽略水平，同时保持图像质量。

Conclusion: AutoDebias能有效处理复杂偏见，提升T2I模型的公平性而不损害其生成质量。

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) models generate high-quality images from text prompts but
often exhibit unintended social biases, such as gender or racial stereotypes,
even when these attributes are not mentioned. Existing debiasing methods work
well for simple or well-known cases but struggle with subtle or overlapping
biases. We propose AutoDebias, a framework that automatically identifies and
mitigates harmful biases in T2I models without prior knowledge of specific bias
types. Specifically, AutoDebias leverages vision-language models to detect
biased visual patterns and constructs fairness guides by generating inclusive
alternative prompts that reflect balanced representations. These guides drive a
CLIP-guided training process that promotes fairer outputs while preserving the
original model's image quality and diversity. Unlike existing methods,
AutoDebias effectively addresses both subtle stereotypes and multiple
interacting biases. We evaluate the framework on a benchmark covering over 25
bias scenarios, including challenging cases where multiple biases occur
simultaneously. AutoDebias detects harmful patterns with 91.6% accuracy and
reduces biased outputs from 90% to negligible levels, while preserving the
visual fidelity of the original model.

Conclusion: CLIPTime展示了视觉语言模型在现实生物监测应用中的潜力。

Abstract: Understanding the temporal dynamics of biological growth is critical across
diverse fields such as microbiology, agriculture, and biodegradation research.
Although vision-language models like Contrastive Language Image Pretraining
(CLIP) have shown strong capabilities in joint visual-textual reasoning, their
effectiveness in capturing temporal progression remains limited. To address
this, we propose CLIPTime, a multimodal, multitask framework designed to
predict both the developmental stage and the corresponding timestamp of fungal
growth from image and text inputs. Built upon the CLIP architecture, our model
learns joint visual-textual embeddings and enables time-aware inference without
requiring explicit temporal input during testing. To facilitate training and
evaluation, we introduce a synthetic fungal growth dataset annotated with
aligned timestamps and categorical stage labels. CLIPTime jointly performs
classification and regression, predicting discrete growth stages alongside
continuous timestamps. We also propose custom evaluation metrics, including
temporal accuracy and regression error, to assess the precision of time-aware
predictions. Experimental results demonstrate that CLIPTime effectively models
biological progression and produces interpretable, temporally grounded outputs,
highlighting the potential of vision-language models in real-world biological
monitoring applications.

Result: 在多个基准数据集上，PIF-Net 显著优于现有方法，同时保持模型高效性。

Conclusion: PIF-Net 通过创新架构和模块设计，有效解决了 MHIF 的病态性问题，提升了融合性能。

Abstract: The goal of multispectral and hyperspectral image fusion (MHIF) is to
generate high-quality images that simultaneously possess rich spectral
information and fine spatial details. However, due to the inherent trade-off
between spectral and spatial information and the limited availability of
observations, this task is fundamentally ill-posed. Previous studies have not
effectively addressed the ill-posed nature caused by data misalignment. To
tackle this challenge, we propose a fusion framework named PIF-Net, which
explicitly incorporates ill-posed priors to effectively fuse multispectral
images and hyperspectral images. To balance global spectral modeling with
computational efficiency, we design a method based on an invertible Mamba
architecture that maintains information consistency during feature
transformation and fusion, ensuring stable gradient flow and process
reversibility. Furthermore, we introduce a novel fusion module called the
Fusion-Aware Low-Rank Adaptation module, which dynamically calibrates spectral
and spatial features while keeping the model lightweight. Extensive experiments
on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that PIF-Net achieves significantly
better image restoration performance than current state-of-the-art methods
while maintaining model efficiency.

Abstract: Recent advancements in video super-resolution (VSR) models have demonstrated
impressive results in enhancing low-resolution videos. However, due to
limitations in adequately controlling the generation process, achieving high
fidelity alignment with the low-resolution input while maintaining temporal
consistency across frames remains a significant challenge. In this work, we
propose Semantic and Temporal Guided Video Super-Resolution (SeTe-VSR), a novel
approach that incorporates both semantic and temporal-spatio guidance in the
latent diffusion space to address these challenges. By incorporating high-level
semantic information and integrating spatial and temporal information, our
approach achieves a seamless balance between recovering intricate details and
ensuring temporal coherence. Our method not only preserves high-reality visual
content but also significantly enhances fidelity. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that SeTe-VSR outperforms existing methods in terms of detail
recovery and perceptual quality, highlighting its effectiveness for complex

Conclusion: HyPCV-Former通过双曲空间建模显著提升了视频异常检测的性能。

Abstract: Video anomaly detection is a fundamental task in video surveillance, with
broad applications in public safety and intelligent monitoring systems.
Although previous methods leverage Euclidean representations in RGB or depth
domains, such embeddings are inherently limited in capturing hierarchical event
structures and spatio-temporal continuity. To address these limitations, we
propose HyPCV-Former, a novel hyperbolic spatio-temporal transformer for
anomaly detection in 3D point cloud videos. Our approach first extracts
per-frame spatial features from point cloud sequences via point cloud
extractor, and then embeds them into Lorentzian hyperbolic space, which better
captures the latent hierarchical structure of events. To model temporal
dynamics, we introduce a hyperbolic multi-head self-attention (HMHA) mechanism
that leverages Lorentzian inner products and curvature-aware softmax to learn
temporal dependencies under non-Euclidean geometry. Our method performs all
feature transformations and anomaly scoring directly within full Lorentzian
space rather than via tangent space approximation. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that HyPCV-Former achieves state-of-the-art performance across
multiple anomaly categories, with a 7\% improvement on the TIMo dataset and a
5.6\% gain on the DAD dataset compared to benchmarks. The code will be released
upon paper acceptance.

Result: 在ID-S、BG-S、IN-R和AVG等指标上优于现有基线，展示了零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: LAMIC为可控多图像合成提供了一种无需训练的新范式，具有强大的泛化能力。

Abstract: In controllable image synthesis, generating coherent and consistent images
from multiple references with spatial layout awareness remains an open
challenge. We present LAMIC, a Layout-Aware Multi-Image Composition framework
that, for the first time, extends single-reference diffusion models to
multi-reference scenarios in a training-free manner. Built upon the MMDiT
model, LAMIC introduces two plug-and-play attention mechanisms: 1) Group
Isolation Attention (GIA) to enhance entity disentanglement; and 2)
Region-Modulated Attention (RMA) to enable layout-aware generation. To
comprehensively evaluate model capabilities, we further introduce three
metrics: 1) Inclusion Ratio (IN-R) and Fill Ratio (FI-R) for assessing layout
control; and 2) Background Similarity (BG-S) for measuring background
consistency. Extensive experiments show that LAMIC achieves state-of-the-art
performance across most major metrics: it consistently outperforms existing
multi-reference baselines in ID-S, BG-S, IN-R and AVG scores across all
settings, and achieves the best DPG in complex composition tasks. These results
demonstrate LAMIC's superior abilities in identity keeping, background
preservation, layout control, and prompt-following, all achieved without any
training or fine-tuning, showcasing strong zero-shot generalization ability. By
inheriting the strengths of advanced single-reference models and enabling
seamless extension to multi-image scenarios, LAMIC establishes a new
training-free paradigm for controllable multi-image composition. As foundation
models continue to evolve, LAMIC's performance is expected to scale
accordingly. Our implementation is available at:

Motivation: 现有深度学习方法主要针对大病灶，忽略了纵向和临床信息，而早期癌症检测需要这些信息。

Result: 在内部纵向数据集上，Dice分数比现有方法提升5%，TPA和BCR均贡献性能提升。

Conclusion: 结合时间和临床背景对乳腺癌筛查中的早期病灶分割至关重要。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of small lesions in Breast Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced
MRI (DCE-MRI) is critical for early cancer detection, especially in high-risk
patients. While recent deep learning methods have advanced lesion segmentation,
they primarily target large lesions and neglect valuable longitudinal and
clinical information routinely used by radiologists. In real-world screening,
detecting subtle or emerging lesions requires radiologists to compare across
timepoints and consider previous radiology assessments, such as the BI-RADS
score. We propose LesiOnTime, a novel 3D segmentation approach that mimics
clinical diagnostic workflows by jointly leveraging longitudinal imaging and
BIRADS scores. The key components are: (1) a Temporal Prior Attention (TPA)
block that dynamically integrates information from previous and current scans;
and (2) a BI-RADS Consistency Regularization (BCR) loss that enforces latent
space alignment for scans with similar radiological assessments, thus embedding
domain knowledge into the training process. Evaluated on a curated in-house
longitudinal dataset of high-risk patients with DCE-MRI, our approach
outperforms state-of-the-art single-timepoint and longitudinal baselines by 5%
in terms of Dice. Ablation studies demonstrate that both TPA and BCR contribute
complementary performance gains. These results highlight the importance of
incorporating temporal and clinical context for reliable early lesion
segmentation in real-world breast cancer screening. Our code is publicly

Abstract: Machine learning for remote sensing imaging relies on up-to-date and accurate
labels for model training and testing. Labelling remote sensing imagery is time
and cost intensive, requiring expert analysis. Previous labelling tools rely on
pre-labelled data for training in order to label new unseen data. In this work,
we define an unsupervised pipeline for finding and labelling geographical areas
of similar context and content within Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. Our
approach removes limitations of previous methods by utilising segmentation with
convolutional and graph neural networks to encode a more robust feature space
for image comparison. Unlike previous approaches we segment the image into
homogeneous regions of pixels that are grouped based on colour and spatial
similarity. Graph neural networks are used to aggregate information about the
surrounding segments enabling the feature representation to encode the local
neighbourhood whilst preserving its own local information. This reduces
outliers in the labelling tool, allows users to label at a granular level, and
allows a rotationally invariant semantic relationship at the image level to be
formed within the encoding space.

Motivation: 自我中心视频在增强现实和机器人等应用中日益重要，但现有研究多关注外部中心视频，自我中心视频的时空定位问题尚未充分探索。

Method: 论文分析了自我中心与外部中心视频的差异，提出了EgoMask基准和自动标注管道，并构建了EgoMask-Train训练数据集。

Result: 实验显示现有模型在EgoMask上表现不佳，但通过EgoMask-Train微调后性能显著提升，且不影响外部中心数据集的表现。

Conclusion: 该研究为自我中心视频理解提供了关键资源和见解，推动了相关领域的发展。

Abstract: Spatiotemporal video grounding aims to localize target entities in videos
based on textual queries. While existing research has made significant progress
in exocentric videos, the egocentric setting remains relatively underexplored,
despite its growing importance in applications such as augmented reality and
robotics. In this work, we conduct a systematic analysis of the discrepancies
between egocentric and exocentric videos, revealing key challenges such as
shorter object durations, sparser trajectories, smaller object sizes, and
larger positional shifts. To address these challenges, we introduce EgoMask,
the first pixel-level benchmark for fine-grained spatiotemporal grounding in
egocentric videos. It is constructed by our proposed automatic annotation
pipeline, which annotates referring expressions and object masks across short-,
medium-, and long-term videos. Additionally, we create EgoMask-Train, a
large-scale training dataset to facilitate model development. Experiments
demonstrate that the state-of-the-art spatiotemporal grounding models perform
poorly on our benchmark EgoMask, but fine-tuning on EgoMask-Train yields
significant improvements, while preserving performance on exocentric datasets.
Our work thus provides essential resources and insights for advancing
egocentric video understanding. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种高效路径聚合网络（EPANet），用于水下鱼类检测，通过互补特征集成实现轻量级且准确的检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下鱼类检测因低分辨率、背景干扰和目标与环境的视觉相似性而具有挑战性，现有方法通常复杂且效率低。

Method: EPANet包含高效路径聚合特征金字塔网络（EPA-FPN）和多尺度多样化短路径瓶颈（MS-DDSP瓶颈），通过长程跳跃连接和跨层融合路径提升特征集成效率。

Result: 在基准数据集上，EPANet在检测精度和推理速度上优于现有方法，同时保持较低的参数复杂度。

Conclusion: EPANet为水下鱼类检测提供了一种高效且轻量级的解决方案。

Abstract: Underwater fish detection (UFD) remains a challenging task in computer vision
due to low object resolution, significant background interference, and high
visual similarity between targets and surroundings. Existing approaches
primarily focus on local feature enhancement or incorporate complex attention
mechanisms to highlight small objects, often at the cost of increased model
complexity and reduced efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose an
efficient path aggregation network (EPANet), which leverages complementary
feature integration to achieve accurate and lightweight UFD. EPANet consists of
two key components: an efficient path aggregation feature pyramid network
(EPA-FPN) and a multi-scale diverse-division short path bottleneck (MS-DDSP
bottleneck). The EPA-FPN introduces long-range skip connections across
disparate scales to improve semantic-spatial complementarity, while cross-layer
fusion paths are adopted to enhance feature integration efficiency. The MS-DDSP
bottleneck extends the conventional bottleneck structure by introducing
finer-grained feature division and diverse convolutional operations, thereby
increasing local feature diversity and representation capacity. Extensive
experiments on benchmark UFD datasets demonstrate that EPANet outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in terms of detection accuracy and inference speed,
while maintaining comparable or even lower parameter complexity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频色彩分级通常需要专业技能，限制了非专业人士的使用。本文旨在通过自动化工具简化这一过程。

Method: 通过扩散模型生成LUT，对齐参考场景与输入视频的色彩属性，并结合文本提示增强低级特征。

Result: 实验和用户研究表明，该方法能有效进行视频色彩分级，同时保持结构细节并实现快速推理。

Conclusion: 提出的框架为视频色彩分级提供了一种高效且用户友好的解决方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: Different from color correction and transfer, color grading involves
adjusting colors for artistic or storytelling purposes in a video, which is
used to establish a specific look or mood. However, due to the complexity of
the process and the need for specialized editing skills, video color grading
remains primarily the domain of professional colorists. In this paper, we
present a reference-based video color grading framework. Our key idea is
explicitly generating a look-up table (LUT) for color attribute alignment
between reference scenes and input video via a diffusion model. As a training
objective, we enforce that high-level features of the reference scenes like
look, mood, and emotion should be similar to that of the input video. Our
LUT-based approach allows for color grading without any loss of structural
details in the whole video frames as well as achieving fast inference. We
further build a pipeline to incorporate a user-preference via text prompts for
low-level feature enhancement such as contrast and brightness, etc.
Experimental results, including extensive user studies, demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach for video color grading. Codes are publicly
available at https://github.com/seunghyuns98/VideoColorGrading.

Motivation: 临床决策依赖解剖结构的相对位置信息，但VLMs在此任务上的能力尚未充分研究，亟需填补这一空白。

Method: 评估了GPT-4o、Llama3.2等先进VLMs的性能，并测试了视觉提示（如标记）的效果，同时提出了MIRP基准数据集。

Result: 现有VLMs在医学图像中表现不佳，视觉提示仅带来有限改进，模型更依赖先验知识而非图像内容。

Conclusion: 医学图像中的相对定位任务仍需进一步研究，MIRP数据集为未来研究提供了系统评估工具。

Abstract: Clinical decision-making relies heavily on understanding relative positions
of anatomical structures and anomalies. Therefore, for Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) to be applicable in clinical practice, the ability to accurately
determine relative positions on medical images is a fundamental prerequisite.
Despite its importance, this capability remains highly underexplored. To
address this gap, we evaluate the ability of state-of-the-art VLMs, GPT-4o,
Llama3.2, Pixtral, and JanusPro, and find that all models fail at this
fundamental task. Inspired by successful approaches in computer vision, we
investigate whether visual prompts, such as alphanumeric or colored markers
placed on anatomical structures, can enhance performance. While these markers
provide moderate improvements, results remain significantly lower on medical
images compared to observations made on natural images. Our evaluations suggest
that, in medical imaging, VLMs rely more on prior anatomical knowledge than on
actual image content for answering relative position questions, often leading
to incorrect conclusions. To facilitate further research in this area, we
introduce the MIRP , Medical Imaging Relative Positioning, benchmark dataset,
designed to systematically evaluate the capability to identify relative
positions in medical images.

Conclusion: DBLP为实时对抗净化提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in deep neural networks (DNNs) have led to remarkable success
across a wide range of tasks. However, their susceptibility to adversarial
perturbations remains a critical vulnerability. Existing diffusion-based
adversarial purification methods often require intensive iterative denoising,
severely limiting their practical deployment. In this paper, we propose
Diffusion Bridge Distillation for Purification (DBLP), a novel and efficient
diffusion-based framework for adversarial purification. Central to our approach
is a new objective, noise bridge distillation, which constructs a principled
alignment between the adversarial noise distribution and the clean data
distribution within a latent consistency model (LCM). To further enhance
semantic fidelity, we introduce adaptive semantic enhancement, which fuses
multi-scale pyramid edge maps as conditioning input to guide the purification
process. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that DBLP
achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) robust accuracy, superior image quality, and
around 0.2s inference time, marking a significant step toward real-time
adversarial purification.

TL;DR: HiPrune是一种无需训练、模型无关的视觉令牌剪枝框架，利用视觉编码器的分层注意力结构，显著提升推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型（VLM）中的长序列视觉令牌导致计算开销大、推理效率低，现有方法依赖特殊令牌或任务特定训练，限制了可扩展性。

Method: HiPrune通过分层注意力结构选择三类信息令牌：锚定令牌（对象中心层高注意力）、缓冲令牌（空间连续性）和注册令牌（全局特征）。

Result: 在LLaVA-1.5等模型上，HiPrune仅用33.3%令牌保留99.3%任务准确率，减少9倍计算开销。

Conclusion: HiPrune是一种高效、通用的令牌剪枝方法，显著提升VLM的推理效率。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) encode images into lengthy sequences of visual
tokens, leading to excessive computational overhead and limited inference
efficiency. While prior efforts prune or merge tokens to address this issue,
they often rely on special tokens (e.g., CLS) or require task-specific
training, hindering scalability across architectures. In this paper, we propose
HiPrune, a training-free and model-agnostic token Pruning framework that
exploits the Hierarchical attention structure within vision encoders. We
identify that middle layers attend to object-centric regions, while deep layers
capture global contextual features. Based on this observation, HiPrune selects
three types of informative tokens: (1) Anchor tokens with high attention in
object-centric layers, (2) Buffer tokens adjacent to anchors for spatial
continuity, and (3) Register tokens with strong attention in deep layers for
global summarization. Our method requires no retraining and integrates
seamlessly with any ViT-based VLM. Extensive experiments on LLaVA-1.5,
LLaVA-NeXT, and Qwen2.5-VL demonstrate that HiPrune achieves state-of-the-art
pruning performance, preserving up to 99.3% task accuracy with only 33.3%
tokens, and maintaining 99.5% accuracy with just 11.1% tokens. Meanwhile, it
reduces inference FLOPs and latency by up to 9$\times$, showcasing strong
generalization across models and tasks. Code is available at

Conclusion: FreeCP有效解决了类别冗余和视觉-语言歧义问题，显著提升了开放词汇语义分割的性能。

Abstract: Fine-tuning pre-trained vision-language models has emerged as a powerful
approach for enhancing open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS). However,
the substantial computational and resource demands associated with training on
large datasets have prompted interest in training-free methods for OVSS.
Existing training-free approaches primarily focus on modifying model
architectures and generating prototypes to improve segmentation performance.
However, they often neglect the challenges posed by class redundancy, where
multiple categories are not present in the current test image, and
visual-language ambiguity, where semantic similarities among categories create
confusion in class activation. These issues can lead to suboptimal class
activation maps and affinity-refined activation maps. Motivated by these
observations, we propose FreeCP, a novel training-free class purification
framework designed to address these challenges. FreeCP focuses on purifying
semantic categories and rectifying errors caused by redundancy and ambiguity.
The purified class representations are then leveraged to produce final
segmentation predictions. We conduct extensive experiments across eight
benchmarks to validate FreeCP's effectiveness. Results demonstrate that FreeCP,
as a plug-and-play module, significantly boosts segmentation performance when
combined with other OVSS methods.

Result: 在PartNet-Mobility数据集上评估，PhysNAP在约束一致性和生成能力之间取得了平衡。

Conclusion: PhysNAP提高了铰接物体生成的物理合理性和点云对齐能力。

Abstract: Articulated objects are an important type of interactable objects in everyday
environments. In this paper, we propose PhysNAP, a novel diffusion model-based
approach for generating articulated objects that aligns them with partial point
clouds and improves their physical plausibility. The model represents part
shapes by signed distance functions (SDFs). We guide the reverse diffusion
process using a point cloud alignment loss computed using the predicted SDFs.
Additionally, we impose non-penetration and mobility constraints based on the
part SDFs for guiding the model to generate more physically plausible objects.
We also make our diffusion approach category-aware to further improve point
cloud alignment if category information is available. We evaluate the
generative ability and constraint consistency of samples generated with PhysNAP
using the PartNet-Mobility dataset. We also compare it with an unguided
baseline diffusion model and demonstrate that PhysNAP can improve constraint
consistency and provides a tradeoff with generative ability.

Motivation: 获取目标检测所需的边界框标注成本高且耗时，尤其是需要领域专家参与。图像级标注更容易获取，因此提出弱监督方法。

Result: 伪标签生成更高效，且在标注时间有限的情况下，性能优于其他弱标签方法甚至真实标注。

Conclusion: 该方法显著降低了标注成本，同时保持了高性能，适用于领域特定的目标检测任务。

Abstract: Current state-of-the-art methods for object detection rely on annotated
bounding boxes of large data sets for training. However, obtaining such
annotations is expensive and can require up to hundreds of hours of manual
labor. This poses a challenge, especially since such annotations can only be
provided by experts, as they require knowledge about the scientific domain. To
tackle this challenge, we propose a domain-specific weakly supervised object
detection algorithm that only relies on image-level annotations, which are
significantly easier to acquire. Our method distills the knowledge of a
pre-trained model, on the task of predicting the presence or absence of a virus
in an image, to obtain a set of pseudo-labels that can be used to later train a
state-of-the-art object detection model. To do so, we use an optimization
approach with a shrinking receptive field to extract virus particles directly
without specific network architectures. Through a set of extensive studies, we
show how the proposed pseudo-labels are easier to obtain, and, more
importantly, are able to outperform other existing weak labeling methods, and
even ground truth labels, in cases where the time to obtain the annotation is
limited.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为CoProU-VO的新方法，通过跨帧不确定性传播改进视觉里程计（VO）在动态场景中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态物体和遮挡会破坏静态场景假设，导致传统无监督VO方法在动态场景中表现不佳。

Method: 结合目标帧和参考帧的不确定性，利用概率公式进行跨帧传播，基于视觉Transformer同时学习深度、不确定性和相机位姿。

Result: 在KITTI和nuScenes数据集上表现优于现有方法，尤其在高速公路场景中表现突出。

Conclusion: 跨帧不确定性传播显著提升了动态场景中的VO性能，验证了方法的有效性。

Abstract: Visual Odometry (VO) is fundamental to autonomous navigation, robotics, and
augmented reality, with unsupervised approaches eliminating the need for
expensive ground-truth labels. However, these methods struggle when dynamic
objects violate the static scene assumption, leading to erroneous pose
estimations. We tackle this problem by uncertainty modeling, which is a
commonly used technique that creates robust masks to filter out dynamic objects
and occlusions without requiring explicit motion segmentation. Traditional
uncertainty modeling considers only single-frame information, overlooking the
uncertainties across consecutive frames. Our key insight is that uncertainty
must be propagated and combined across temporal frames to effectively identify
unreliable regions, particularly in dynamic scenes. To address this challenge,
we introduce Combined Projected Uncertainty VO (CoProU-VO), a novel end-to-end
approach that combines target frame uncertainty with projected reference frame
uncertainty using a principled probabilistic formulation. Built upon vision
transformer backbones, our model simultaneously learns depth, uncertainty
estimation, and camera poses. Consequently, experiments on the KITTI and
nuScenes datasets demonstrate significant improvements over previous
unsupervised monocular end-to-end two-frame-based methods and exhibit strong
performance in challenging highway scenes where other approaches often fail.
Additionally, comprehensive ablation studies validate the effectiveness of
cross-frame uncertainty propagation.

Motivation: 解决现有方法在复杂场景中难以区分稀有类别与未知对象的问题。

Result: 在五个标准数据集上，误报率最低（2.5%），平均精度高（90.91%），计算开销可忽略。

Conclusion: 通过显式建模不确定性，有效提升了未知对象的检测性能。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation models trained on known object classes often fail in
real-world autonomous driving scenarios by confidently misclassifying unknown
objects. While pixel-wise out-of-distribution detection can identify unknown
objects, existing methods struggle in complex scenes where rare object classes
are often confused with truly unknown objects. We introduce an
uncertainty-aware likelihood ratio estimation method that addresses these
limitations. Our approach uses an evidential classifier within a likelihood
ratio test to distinguish between known and unknown pixel features from a
semantic segmentation model, while explicitly accounting for uncertainty.
Instead of producing point estimates, our method outputs probability
distributions that capture uncertainty from both rare training examples and
imperfect synthetic outliers. We show that by incorporating uncertainty in this
way, outlier exposure can be leveraged more effectively. Evaluated on five
standard benchmark datasets, our method achieves the lowest average false
positive rate (2.5%) among state-of-the-art while maintaining high average
precision (90.91%) and incurring only negligible computational overhead. Code

Motivation: NTL遥感是量化人类活动强度和空间分布的重要指标，但现有VIIRS传感器的时间覆盖范围有限，限制了长期时间序列研究。

Method: 提出了一个两阶段重建框架：构建阶段使用分层融合解码器（HFD）提高初始重建的保真度，细化阶段采用双特征细化器（DFR）利用高分辨率不透水面掩模增强细节。

Result: 开发的EVAL产品将VIIRS类数据扩展到1986年，R²从0.68提升至0.80，RMSE从1.27降至0.99，表现出优异的时间一致性和社会经济参数相关性。

Conclusion: EVAL数据集为研究社区提供了新的资源，适用于长期分析，并已公开可用。

Abstract: Artificial Night-Time Light (NTL) remote sensing is a vital proxy for
quantifying the intensity and spatial distribution of human activities.
Although the NPP-VIIRS sensor provides high-quality NTL observations, its
temporal coverage, which begins in 2012, restricts long-term time-series
studies that extend to earlier periods. Despite the progress in extending
VIIRS-like NTL time-series, current methods still suffer from two significant
shortcomings: the underestimation of light intensity and the structural
omission. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel reconstruction
framework consisting of a two-stage process: construction and refinement. The
construction stage features a Hierarchical Fusion Decoder (HFD) designed to
enhance the fidelity of the initial reconstruction. The refinement stage
employs a Dual Feature Refiner (DFR), which leverages high-resolution
impervious surface masks to guide and enhance fine-grained structural details.
Based on this framework, we developed the Extended VIIRS-like Artificial
Nighttime Light (EVAL) product for China, extending the standard data record
backwards by 26 years to begin in 1986. Quantitative evaluation shows that EVAL
significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art products, boosting the
$\text{R}^2$ from 0.68 to 0.80 while lowering the RMSE from 1.27 to 0.99.
Furthermore, EVAL exhibits excellent temporal consistency and maintains a high
correlation with socioeconomic parameters, confirming its reliability for
long-term analysis. The resulting EVAL dataset provides a valuable new resource
for the research community and is publicly available at
https://doi.org/10.11888/HumanNat.tpdc.302930.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的NSFW检测方法（文本过滤器和图像过滤器）存在效率低或易受攻击的问题，需要一种更高效且准确的方法。

Method: 提出Wukong框架，利用扩散模型早期去噪步骤的中间输出和预训练的跨注意力参数进行NSFW检测。

Result: Wukong在效率和准确性上显著优于文本过滤器，与图像过滤器相当。

Conclusion: Wukong为NSFW检测提供了一种高效且准确的解决方案，适用于现代T2I系统。

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) generation is a popular AI-generated content (AIGC)
technology enabling diverse and creative image synthesis. However, some outputs
may contain Not Safe For Work (NSFW) content (e.g., violence), violating
community guidelines. Detecting NSFW content efficiently and accurately, known
as external safeguarding, is essential. Existing external safeguards fall into
two types: text filters, which analyze user prompts but overlook T2I
model-specific variations and are prone to adversarial attacks; and image
filters, which analyze final generated images but are computationally costly
and introduce latency. Diffusion models, the foundation of modern T2I systems
like Stable Diffusion, generate images through iterative denoising using a
U-Net architecture with ResNet and Transformer blocks. We observe that: (1)
early denoising steps define the semantic layout of the image, and (2)
cross-attention layers in U-Net are crucial for aligning text and image
regions. Based on these insights, we propose Wukong, a transformer-based NSFW
detection framework that leverages intermediate outputs from early denoising
steps and reuses U-Net's pre-trained cross-attention parameters. Wukong
operates within the diffusion process, enabling early detection without waiting
for full image generation. We also introduce a new dataset containing prompts,
seeds, and image-specific NSFW labels, and evaluate Wukong on this and two
public benchmarks. Results show that Wukong significantly outperforms
text-based safeguards and achieves comparable accuracy of image filters, while
offering much greater efficiency.

Motivation: 复杂场景中运动场的多样性和异质性导致现有方法难以准确建模，需要针对性策略。

Result: 在相对位姿和单应性估计任务中优于现有方法，并表现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: GeoMoE通过简洁设计有效解决了异质运动场建模问题，性能显著提升。

Abstract: Recent progress in two-view geometry increasingly emphasizes enforcing
smoothness and global consistency priors when estimating motion fields between
pairs of images. However, in complex real-world scenes, characterized by
extreme viewpoint and scale changes as well as pronounced depth
discontinuities, the motion field often exhibits diverse and heterogeneous
motion patterns. Most existing methods lack targeted modeling strategies and
fail to explicitly account for this variability, resulting in estimated motion
fields that diverge from their true underlying structure and distribution. We
observe that Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) can assign dedicated experts to motion
sub-fields, enabling a divide-and-conquer strategy for heterogeneous motion
patterns. Building on this insight, we re-architect motion field modeling in
two-view geometry with GeoMoE, a streamlined framework. Specifically, we first
devise a Probabilistic Prior-Guided Decomposition strategy that exploits inlier
probability signals to perform a structure-aware decomposition of the motion
field into heterogeneous sub-fields, sharply curbing outlier-induced bias.
Next, we introduce an MoE-Enhanced Bi-Path Rectifier that enhances each
sub-field along spatial-context and channel-semantic paths and routes it to a
customized expert for targeted modeling, thereby decoupling heterogeneous
motion regimes, suppressing cross-sub-field interference and representational
entanglement, and yielding fine-grained motion-field rectification. With this
minimalist design, GeoMoE outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods in
relative pose and homography estimation and shows strong generalization. The

TL;DR: DPoser-X是一种基于扩散的3D全身人体姿态先验模型，通过变分扩散采样解决姿态任务，结合截断时间步调度和掩码训练机制，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 构建多功能且鲁棒的全身人体姿态先验模型面临复杂姿态和高质量数据集稀缺的挑战。

Method: 提出扩散模型DPoser-X，统一姿态任务为逆问题，采用变分扩散采样，引入截断时间步调度和掩码训练机制。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异，优于现有方法，为全身姿态先验建模设定了新标准。

Conclusion: DPoser-X在全身人体姿态建模中展现出强大的鲁棒性和多功能性，成为新的标杆。

Abstract: We present DPoser-X, a diffusion-based prior model for 3D whole-body human
poses. Building a versatile and robust full-body human pose prior remains
challenging due to the inherent complexity of articulated human poses and the
scarcity of high-quality whole-body pose datasets. To address these
limitations, we introduce a Diffusion model as body Pose prior (DPoser) and
extend it to DPoser-X for expressive whole-body human pose modeling. Our
approach unifies various pose-centric tasks as inverse problems, solving them
through variational diffusion sampling. To enhance performance on downstream
applications, we introduce a novel truncated timestep scheduling method
specifically designed for pose data characteristics. We also propose a masked
training mechanism that effectively combines whole-body and part-specific
datasets, enabling our model to capture interdependencies between body parts
while avoiding overfitting to specific actions. Extensive experiments
demonstrate DPoser-X's robustness and versatility across multiple benchmarks
for body, hand, face, and full-body pose modeling. Our model consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives, establishing a new benchmark for
whole-body human pose prior modeling.

Abstract: Face Recognition Systems that operate in unconstrained environments capture

regresses bounding boxes and landmark coordinates for proper Face Alignment.
This paper shows the effectiveness of Object Generation Attacks on Face
Detection, dubbed Face Generation Attacks, and demonstrates for the first time
a Landmark Shift Attack that backdoors the coordinate regression task performed
by face detectors. We then offer mitigations against these vulnerabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决医学图像数据集中属性标注稀缺的问题，以增强可解释模型在医学图像诊断中的透明性和实用性。

Method: 采用扩散模型（Diffusion Model）进行属性条件化增强，仅使用20个标注样本生成合成数据，并将其用于训练可解释模型。

Result: 合成数据显著提升了模型的性能，属性预测准确率提高了13.4%，目标预测准确率提高了1.8%。

Conclusion: 合成数据能够有效克服数据集限制，提升可解释模型在医学图像分析中的适用性。

Abstract: Classification models that provide human-interpretable explanations enhance
clinicians' trust and usability in medical image diagnosis. One research focus
is the integration and prediction of pathology-related visual attributes used
by radiologists alongside the diagnosis, aligning AI decision-making with
clinical reasoning. Radiologists use attributes like shape and texture as
established diagnostic criteria and mirroring these in AI decision-making both
enhances transparency and enables explicit validation of model outputs.
However, the adoption of such models is limited by the scarcity of large-scale
medical image datasets annotated with these attributes. To address this
challenge, we propose synthesizing attribute-annotated data using a generative
model. We enhance the Diffusion Model with attribute conditioning and train it
using only 20 attribute-labeled lung nodule samples from the LIDC-IDRI dataset.
Incorporating its generated images into the training of an explainable model
boosts performance, increasing attribute prediction accuracy by 13.4% and
target prediction accuracy by 1.8% compared to training with only the small
real attribute-annotated dataset. This work highlights the potential of
synthetic data to overcome dataset limitations, enhancing the applicability of
explainable models in medical image analysis.

TL;DR: SU-ESRGAN是一种用于卫星图像的超分辨率框架，结合了ESRGAN、DeepLabv3分割损失和蒙特卡洛dropout，生成像素级不确定性图，提升语义一致性和可信度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GANs在图像超分辨率中缺乏语义一致性和像素级可信度，限制了其在遥感关键应用中的可靠性。

Method: 提出SU-ESRGAN框架，整合ESRGAN、DeepLabv3分割损失和蒙特卡洛dropout，生成不确定性图。

Result: 在PSNR、SSIM和LPIPS指标上与基线ESRGAN相当，适用于卫星和无人机系统。

Conclusion: SU-ESRGAN在跨域应用中表现良好，强调了领域感知训练的重要性。

Abstract: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have achieved realistic
super-resolution (SR) of images however, they lack semantic consistency and
per-pixel confidence, limiting their credibility in critical remote sensing
applications such as disaster response, urban planning and agriculture. This
paper introduces Semantic and Uncertainty-Aware ESRGAN (SU-ESRGAN), the first
SR framework designed for satellite imagery to integrate the ESRGAN,
segmentation loss via DeepLabv3 for class detail preservation and Monte Carlo
dropout to produce pixel-wise uncertainty maps. The SU-ESRGAN produces results
(PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS) comparable to the Baseline ESRGAN on aerial imagery. This
novel model is valuable in satellite systems or UAVs that use wide
field-of-view (FoV) cameras, trading off spatial resolution for coverage. The
modular design allows integration in UAV data pipelines for on-board or
post-processing SR to enhance imagery resulting due to motion blur, compression
and sensor limitations. Further, the model is fine-tuned to evaluate its
performance on cross domain applications. The tests are conducted on two drone
based datasets which differ in altitude and imaging perspective. Performance
evaluation of the fine-tuned models show a stronger adaptation to the Aerial
Maritime Drone Dataset, whose imaging characteristics align with the training
data, highlighting the importance of domain-aware training in SR-applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防御评估缺乏统一框架，导致评估不一致且不完整，需建立全面基准以改进防御方法。

Method: 重新评估11种代表性防御方法，构建包含2种攻击目标、13种补丁攻击、11种目标检测器和4种指标的基准，并创建大规模对抗补丁数据集。

Result: 发现自然补丁防御困难源于数据分布而非高频特征；新数据集可提升防御性能15.09% AP@0.5；自适应攻击能显著绕过现有防御。

Conclusion: 研究为补丁攻击/防御的评估和设计提供了指导，未来将持续更新攻击/防御方法。

Abstract: Developing reliable defenses against patch attacks on object detectors has
attracted increasing interest. However, we identify that existing defense
evaluations lack a unified and comprehensive framework, resulting in
inconsistent and incomplete assessments of current methods. To address this
issue, we revisit 11 representative defenses and present the first patch
defense benchmark, involving 2 attack goals, 13 patch attacks, 11 object
detectors, and 4 diverse metrics. This leads to the large-scale adversarial
patch dataset with 94 types of patches and 94,000 images. Our comprehensive
analyses reveal new insights: (1) The difficulty in defending against
naturalistic patches lies in the data distribution, rather than the commonly
believed high frequencies. Our new dataset with diverse patch distributions can
be used to improve existing defenses by 15.09% AP@0.5. (2) The average
precision of the attacked object, rather than the commonly pursued patch
detection accuracy, shows high consistency with defense performance. (3)
Adaptive attacks can substantially bypass existing defenses, and defenses with
complex/stochastic models or universal patch properties are relatively robust.
We hope that our analyses will serve as guidance on properly evaluating patch
attacks/defenses and advancing their design. Code and dataset are available at
https://github.com/Gandolfczjh/APDE, where we will keep integrating new
attacks/defenses.

Result: 多基准测试验证了方法的有效性和广泛适用性。

Conclusion: 预训练深度特征在图像去雾中具有潜力，提出的模块能灵活适配不同架构。

Abstract: Image dehazing remains a challenging problem due to the spatially varying
nature of haze in real-world scenes. While existing methods have demonstrated
the promise of large-scale pretrained models for image dehazing, their
architecture-specific designs hinder adaptability across diverse scenarios with
different accuracy and efficiency requirements. In this work, we systematically
investigate the generalization capability of pretrained depth
representations-learned from millions of diverse images-for image dehazing. Our
empirical analysis reveals that the learned deep depth features maintain
remarkable consistency across varying haze levels. Building on this insight, we
propose a plug-and-play RGB-D fusion module that seamlessly integrates with
diverse dehazing architectures. Extensive experiments across multiple
benchmarks validate both the effectiveness and broad applicability of our
approach.

Conclusion: D3具有高效的计算性能和强鲁棒性，为合成视频检测提供了新思路。

Abstract: The evolution of video generation techniques, such as Sora, has made it
increasingly easy to produce high-fidelity AI-generated videos, raising public
concern over the dissemination of synthetic content. However, existing
detection methodologies remain limited by their insufficient exploration of
temporal artifacts in synthetic videos. To bridge this gap, we establish a
theoretical framework through second-order dynamical analysis under Newtonian
mechanics, subsequently extending the Second-order Central Difference features
tailored for temporal artifact detection. Building on this theoretical
foundation, we reveal a fundamental divergence in second-order feature
distributions between real and AI-generated videos. Concretely, we propose
Detection by Difference of Differences (D3), a novel training-free detection
method that leverages the above second-order temporal discrepancies. We
validate the superiority of our D3 on 4 open-source datasets (Gen-Video,
VideoPhy, EvalCrafter, VidProM), 40 subsets in total. For example, on GenVideo,
D3 outperforms the previous best method by 10.39% (absolute) mean Average
Precision. Additional experiments on time cost and post-processing operations
demonstrate D3's exceptional computational efficiency and strong robust
performance. Our code is available at https://github.com/Zig-HS/D3.

Result: 实验表明，动态注意力平衡机制能有效减少幻觉，提升多图像场景下的语义整合和推理稳定性。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了多图像MLLMs幻觉研究的空白，提出的方法具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Despite growing interest in hallucination in Multimodal Large Language
Models, existing studies primarily focus on single-image settings, leaving
hallucination in multi-image scenarios largely unexplored. To address this gap,
we conduct the first systematic study of hallucinations in multi-image MLLMs
and propose MIHBench, a benchmark specifically tailored for evaluating
object-related hallucinations across multiple images. MIHBench comprises three
core tasks: Multi-Image Object Existence Hallucination, Multi-Image Object
Count Hallucination, and Object Identity Consistency Hallucination, targeting
semantic understanding across object existence, quantity reasoning, and
cross-view identity consistency. Through extensive evaluation, we identify key
factors associated with the occurrence of multi-image hallucinations,
including: a progressive relationship between the number of image inputs and
the likelihood of hallucination occurrences; a strong correlation between
single-image hallucination tendencies and those observed in multi-image
contexts; and the influence of same-object image ratios and the positional
placement of negative samples within image sequences on the occurrence of
object identity consistency hallucination. To address these challenges, we
propose a Dynamic Attention Balancing mechanism that adjusts inter-image
attention distributions while preserving the overall visual attention
proportion. Experiments across multiple state-of-the-art MLLMs demonstrate that
our method effectively reduces hallucination occurrences and enhances semantic
integration and reasoning stability in multi-image scenarios.

Conclusion: YOLO-Count在开放词汇计数和生成控制方面表现出色，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: We propose YOLO-Count, a differentiable open-vocabulary object counting model
that tackles both general counting challenges and enables precise quantity
control for text-to-image (T2I) generation. A core contribution is the
'cardinality' map, a novel regression target that accounts for variations in
object size and spatial distribution. Leveraging representation alignment and a
hybrid strong-weak supervision scheme, YOLO-Count bridges the gap between
open-vocabulary counting and T2I generation control. Its fully differentiable
architecture facilitates gradient-based optimization, enabling accurate object
count estimation and fine-grained guidance for generative models. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that YOLO-Count achieves state-of-the-art counting
accuracy while providing robust and effective quantity control for T2I systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D目标检测方法多依赖复杂骨干网络，轻量级设计研究不足，需兼顾速度和精度。

Method: 提出Dense Backbone，结合密集层设计，适配多种现有检测器（如PillarNet），实现轻量化。

Result: DensePillarNet在nuScenes测试集上参数减少29%，延迟降低28%，精度仅下降2%。

Conclusion: Dense Backbone为3D点云目标检测提供高效轻量解决方案，易于集成现有架构。

Abstract: Recent advancements in LiDAR-based 3D object detection have significantly
accelerated progress toward the realization of fully autonomous driving in
real-world environments. Despite achieving high detection performance, most of
the approaches still rely on a VGG-based or ResNet-based backbone for feature
exploration, which increases the model complexity. Lightweight backbone design
is well-explored for 2D object detection, but research on 3D object detection
still remains limited. In this work, we introduce Dense Backbone, a lightweight
backbone that combines the benefits of high processing speed, lightweight
architecture, and robust detection accuracy. We adapt multiple SoTA 3d object
detectors, such as PillarNet, with our backbone and show that with our
backbone, these models retain most of their detection capability at a
significantly reduced computational cost. To our knowledge, this is the first
dense-layer-based backbone tailored specifically for 3D object detection from
point cloud data. DensePillarNet, our adaptation of PillarNet, achieves a 29%
reduction in model parameters and a 28% reduction in latency with just a 2%
drop in detection accuracy on the nuScenes test set. Furthermore, Dense
Backbone's plug-and-play design allows straightforward integration into
existing architectures, requiring no modifications to other network components.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自监督视觉基础模型能捕捉语义对应，但缺乏对3D几何的感知。GECO旨在填补这一空白，生成几何一致的特征。

Method: 采用最优传输的训练框架，支持超越关键点的监督，即使在遮挡和去遮挡情况下也能工作。轻量级架构实现30 fps的高效运行。

Result: 在PFPascal、APK和CUB数据集上达到SOTA性能，PCK分别提升6.0%、6.2%和4.1%。运行速度比现有方法快98.2%。

Conclusion: PCK不足以全面评估几何质量，GECO提出了新的几何感知指标，为特征学习提供了更深入的见解。

Abstract: Recent advances in feature learning have shown that self-supervised vision
foundation models can capture semantic correspondences but often lack awareness
of underlying 3D geometry. GECO addresses this gap by producing geometrically
coherent features that semantically distinguish parts based on geometry (e.g.,
left/right eyes, front/back legs). We propose a training framework based on
optimal transport, enabling supervision beyond keypoints, even under occlusions
and disocclusions. With a lightweight architecture, GECO runs at 30 fps, 98.2%
faster than prior methods, while achieving state-of-the-art performance on
PFPascal, APK, and CUB, improving PCK by 6.0%, 6.2%, and 4.1%, respectively.
Finally, we show that PCK alone is insufficient to capture geometric quality
and introduce new metrics and insights for more geometry-aware feature
learning. Link to project page:

Conclusion: 研究强调了在虚拟头像通信系统中开发更先进行为生物特征防御的紧迫性，并提供了相关数据集和系统供研究社区使用。

Abstract: Photorealistic talking-head avatars are becoming increasingly common in
virtual meetings, gaming, and social platforms. These avatars allow for more
immersive communication, but they also introduce serious security risks. One
emerging threat is impersonation: an attacker can steal a user's
avatar-preserving their appearance and voice-making it nearly impossible to
detect its fraudulent usage by sight or sound alone. In this paper, we explore
the challenge of biometric verification in such avatar-mediated scenarios. Our
main question is whether an individual's facial motion patterns can serve as
reliable behavioral biometrics to verify their identity when the avatar's
visual appearance is a facsimile of its owner. To answer this question, we
introduce a new dataset of realistic avatar videos created using a
state-of-the-art one-shot avatar generation model, GAGAvatar, with genuine and
impostor avatar videos. We also propose a lightweight, explainable
spatio-temporal Graph Convolutional Network architecture with temporal
attention pooling, that uses only facial landmarks to model dynamic facial
gestures. Experimental results demonstrate that facial motion cues enable
meaningful identity verification with AUC values approaching 80%. The proposed
benchmark and biometric system are available for the research community in
order to bring attention to the urgent need for more advanced behavioral
biometric defenses in avatar-based communication systems.

Result: 在低剂量CT去噪和T1到T2 MRI转换任务中表现优于基线模型和现有TTA方法。

Conclusion: 动态、样本特定的调整是提升模型在真实场景中鲁棒性的有效途径。

Abstract: Image-to-image translation has emerged as a powerful technique in medical
imaging, enabling tasks such as image denoising and cross-modality conversion.
However, it suffers from limitations in handling out-of-distribution samples
without causing performance degradation. To address this limitation, we propose
a novel Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) framework that dynamically adjusts the
translation process based on the characteristics of each test sample. Our
method introduces a Reconstruction Module to quantify the domain shift and a
Dynamic Adaptation Block that selectively modifies the internal features of a
pretrained translation model to mitigate the shift without compromising the
performance on in-distribution samples that do not require adaptation. We
evaluate our approach on two medical image-to-image translation tasks: low-dose
CT denoising and T1 to T2 MRI translation, showing consistent improvements over
both the baseline translation model without TTA and prior TTA methods. Our
analysis highlights the limitations of the state-of-the-art that uniformly
apply the adaptation to both out-of-distribution and in-distribution samples,
demonstrating that dynamic, sample-specific adjustment offers a promising path
to improve model resilience in real-world scenarios. The code is available at:

Motivation: 现有零样本异常检测方法在域迁移下表现不佳，因其训练数据有限且难以泛化到新分布。

Result: 在13个工业和医学基准测试中，PILOT在域迁移下的异常检测和定位性能达到最优。

Conclusion: PILOT通过动态提示学习和测试时适应，显著提升了零样本异常检测的泛化能力。

Abstract: Zero-shot anomaly detection (ZSAD) enables identifying and localizing defects
in unseen categories by relying solely on generalizable features rather than
requiring any labeled examples of anomalies. However, existing ZSAD methods,
whether using fixed or learned prompts, struggle under domain shifts because
their training data are derived from limited training domains and fail to
generalize to new distributions. In this paper, we introduce PILOT, a framework
designed to overcome these challenges through two key innovations: (1) a novel
dual-branch prompt learning mechanism that dynamically integrates a pool of
learnable prompts with structured semantic attributes, enabling the model to
adaptively weight the most relevant anomaly cues for each input image; and (2)
a label-free test-time adaptation strategy that updates the learnable prompt
parameters using high-confidence pseudo-labels from unlabeled test data.
Extensive experiments on 13 industrial and medical benchmarks demonstrate that
PILOT achieves state-of-the-art performance in both anomaly detection and
localization under domain shift.

Motivation: 探索如何统一不同标记的3D数据，以提升公共安全应用中点云语义分割的可靠性。

Result: 几何大物体（如楼梯、窗户）分割效果较好，小安全关键特征识别率低，受类别不平衡和几何区分度限制影响。

Conclusion: 公共安全领域的可靠点云语义分割需要标准化标注协议和改进标注技术，以解决数据异构性和小物体检测问题。

Abstract: This study analyzes semantic segmentation performance across heterogeneously
labeled point-cloud datasets relevant to public safety applications, including
pre-incident planning systems derived from lidar scans. Using NIST's Point
Cloud City dataset (Enfield and Memphis collections), we investigate challenges
in unifying differently labeled 3D data. Our methodology employs a graded
schema with the KPConv architecture, evaluating performance through IoU metrics
on safety-relevant features. Results indicate performance variability:
geometrically large objects (e.g. stairs, windows) achieve higher segmentation
performance, suggesting potential for navigational context, while smaller
safety-critical features exhibit lower recognition rates. Performance is
impacted by class imbalance and the limited geometric distinction of smaller
objects in typical lidar scans, indicating limitations in detecting certain
safety-relevant features using current point-cloud methods. Key identified
challenges include insufficient labeled data, difficulties in unifying class
labels across datasets, and the need for standardization. Potential directions
include automated labeling and multi-dataset learning strategies. We conclude
that reliable point-cloud semantic segmentation for public safety necessitates
standardized annotation protocols and improved labeling techniques to address
data heterogeneity and the detection of small, safety-critical elements.

simulation environments, spanning precision manipulators, mobile robots, and
dexterous hands. We demonstrate the framework's effectiveness through precision
manipulation tasks and validate data quality by training VLA models that
exhibit robust autonomous performance.

Abstract: Recent advances in teleoperation have demonstrated robots performing complex
manipulation tasks. However, existing works rarely support whole-body
joint-level teleoperation for humanoid robots, limiting the diversity of tasks
that can be accomplished. This work presents Controller for Humanoid Imitation
and Live Demonstration (CHILD), a compact reconfigurable teleoperation system
that enables joint level control over humanoid robots. CHILD fits within a
standard baby carrier, allowing the operator control over all four limbs, and
supports both direct joint mapping for full-body control and loco-manipulation.
Adaptive force feedback is incorporated to enhance operator experience and
prevent unsafe joint movements. We validate the capabilities of this system by
conducting loco-manipulation and full-body control examples on a humanoid robot
and multiple dual-arm systems. Lastly, we open-source the design of the
hardware promoting accessibility and reproducibility. Additional details and
open-source information are available at our project website:

Abstract: This paper presents a topology-inspired morphological descriptor for soft
continuum robots by combining a pseudo-rigid-body (PRB) model with Morse theory
to achieve a quantitative characterization of robot morphologies. By counting
critical points of directional projections, the proposed descriptor enables a
discrete representation of multimodal configurations and facilitates
morphological classification. Furthermore, we apply the descriptor to
morphology control by formulating the target configuration as an optimization
problem to compute actuation parameters that generate equilibrium shapes with
desired topological features. The proposed framework provides a unified
methodology for quantitative morphology description, classification, and
control of soft continuum robots, with the potential to enhance their precision
and adaptability in medical applications such as minimally invasive surgery and
endovascular interventions.

### [93] [UAV-ON: A Benchmark for Open-World Object Goal Navigation with Aerial Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00288)
*Jianqiang Xiao,Yuexuan Sun,Yixin Shao,Boxi Gan,Rongqiang Liu,Yanjing Wu,Weili Gua,Xiang Deng*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: UAV-ON是一个面向空中智能体的大规模目标导航基准，旨在解决传统视觉与语言导航（VLN）依赖详细指令的局限性，通过语义目标驱动导航。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有空中导航研究多依赖VLN范式，限制了可扩展性和自主性。UAV-ON通过引入语义目标导航，填补了这一空白。

Method: UAV-ON包含14个高保真环境，定义了1270个目标对象，并提供实例级语义指令。基准测试中采用了模块化策略AOA。

Result: 实验显示所有基线方法在该场景下表现不佳，突显了空中导航与语义目标结合的复杂性。

Conclusion: UAV-ON旨在推动基于语义目标的无人机自主导航研究，适用于复杂现实环境。

Abstract: Aerial navigation is a fundamental yet underexplored capability in embodied
intelligence, enabling agents to operate in large-scale, unstructured
environments where traditional navigation paradigms fall short. However, most
existing research follows the Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) paradigm,
which heavily depends on sequential linguistic instructions, limiting its
scalability and autonomy. To address this gap, we introduce UAV-ON, a benchmark
for large-scale Object Goal Navigation (ObjectNav) by aerial agents in
open-world environments, where agents operate based on high-level semantic
goals without relying on detailed instructional guidance as in VLN. UAV-ON
comprises 14 high-fidelity Unreal Engine environments with diverse semantic
regions and complex spatial layouts, covering urban, natural, and mixed-use
settings. It defines 1270 annotated target objects, each characterized by an
instance-level instruction that encodes category, physical footprint, and
visual descriptors, allowing grounded reasoning. These instructions serve as
semantic goals, introducing realistic ambiguity and complex reasoning
challenges for aerial agents. To evaluate the benchmark, we implement several
baseline methods, including Aerial ObjectNav Agent (AOA), a modular policy that
integrates instruction semantics with egocentric observations for long-horizon,
goal-directed exploration. Empirical results show that all baselines struggle
in this setting, highlighting the compounded challenges of aerial navigation
and semantic goal grounding. UAV-ON aims to advance research on scalable UAV
autonomy driven by semantic goal descriptions in complex real-world
environments.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在轨迹预测中难以同时满足准确性和道路几何一致性，TopoDiffuser旨在通过拓扑地图嵌入解决这一问题。

Method: 利用条件扩散模型，将拓扑地图的结构信息融入去噪过程，并通过多模态编码器融合LiDAR观测、历史运动和路径信息。

Result: 在KITTI基准测试中表现优于现有方法，同时保持几何一致性。消融实验验证了各输入模态和去噪步骤的贡献。

Conclusion: TopoDiffuser提供了一种无需显式约束即可生成道路合规轨迹的有效方法，代码已开源。

Abstract: This paper introduces TopoDiffuser, a diffusion-based framework for
multimodal trajectory prediction that incorporates topometric maps to generate
accurate, diverse, and road-compliant future motion forecasts. By embedding
structural cues from topometric maps into the denoising process of a
conditional diffusion model, the proposed approach enables trajectory
generation that naturally adheres to road geometry without relying on explicit
constraints. A multimodal conditioning encoder fuses LiDAR observations,
historical motion, and route information into a unified bird's-eye-view (BEV)
representation. Extensive experiments on the KITTI benchmark demonstrate that
TopoDiffuser outperforms state-of-the-art methods, while maintaining strong
geometric consistency. Ablation studies further validate the contribution of
each input modality, as well as the impact of denoising steps and the number of
trajectory samples. To support future research, we publicly release our code at
https://github.com/EI-Nav/TopoDiffuser.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Omni-Scan是一种利用双手机器人抓取和旋转物体以生成高质量3D高斯溅射模型的管道，适用于缺陷检测等领域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统3D物体扫描方法受限于工作空间和设备，需要更灵活高效的解决方案。

Method: 使用双手机器人抓取和旋转物体，结合DepthAnything、Segment Anything和RAFT光流模型去除背景和夹持器遮挡，改进3DGS训练管道。

Result: 在12种工业和家用物体上检测视觉或几何缺陷的平均准确率为83%。

Conclusion: Omni-Scan提供了一种高效且灵活的3D物体建模方法，适用于多种应用场景。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splats (3DGSs) are 3D object models derived from multi-view
images. Such "digital twins" are useful for simulations, virtual reality,
marketing, robot policy fine-tuning, and part inspection. 3D object scanning
usually requires multi-camera arrays, precise laser scanners, or robot
wrist-mounted cameras, which have restricted workspaces. We propose Omni-Scan,
a pipeline for producing high-quality 3D Gaussian Splat models using a
bi-manual robot that grasps an object with one gripper and rotates the object
with respect to a stationary camera. The object is then re-grasped by a second
gripper to expose surfaces that were occluded by the first gripper. We present
the Omni-Scan robot pipeline using DepthAny-thing, Segment Anything, as well as
RAFT optical flow models to identify and isolate objects held by a robot
gripper while removing the gripper and the background. We then modify the 3DGS
training pipeline to support concatenated datasets with gripper occlusion,
producing an omni-directional (360 degree view) model of the object. We apply
Omni-Scan to part defect inspection, finding that it can identify visual or
geometric defects in 12 different industrial and household objects with an
average accuracy of 83%. Interactive videos of Omni-Scan 3DGS models can be

Conclusion: TOP方法能够显著提升人形机器人在站立操控任务中的表现，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Humanoid robots have the potential capability to perform a diverse range of
manipulation tasks, but this is based on a robust and precise standing
controller. Existing methods are either ill-suited to precisely control
high-dimensional upper-body joints, or difficult to ensure both robustness and
accuracy, especially when upper-body motions are fast. This paper proposes a
novel time optimization policy (TOP), to train a standing manipulation control
model that ensures balance, precision, and time efficiency simultaneously, with
the idea of adjusting the time trajectory of upper-body motions but not only
strengthening the disturbance resistance of the lower-body. Our approach
consists of three parts. Firstly, we utilize motion prior to represent
upper-body motions to enhance the coordination ability between the upper and
lower-body by training a variational autoencoder (VAE). Then we decouple the
whole-body control into an upper-body PD controller for precision and a
lower-body RL controller to enhance robust stability. Finally, we train TOP
method in conjunction with the decoupled controller and VAE to reduce the
balance burden resulting from fast upper-body motions that would destabilize
the robot and exceed the capabilities of the lower-body RL policy. The
effectiveness of the proposed approach is evaluated via both simulation and
real world experiments, which demonstrate the superiority on standing
manipulation tasks stably and accurately. The project page can be found at

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效解决了人形机器人运动模仿中的平衡与精度问题。

Abstract: Motion imitation is a pivotal and effective approach for humanoid robots to
achieve a more diverse range of complex and expressive movements, making their
performances more human-like. However, the significant differences in
kinematics and dynamics between humanoid robots and humans present a major
challenge in accurately imitating motion while maintaining balance. In this
paper, we propose a novel whole-body motion imitation framework for a full-size
humanoid robot. The proposed method employs contact-aware whole-body motion
retargeting to mimic human motion and provide initial values for reference
trajectories, and the non-linear centroidal model predictive controller ensures
the motion accuracy while maintaining balance and overcoming external
disturbances in real time. The assistance of the whole-body controller allows
for more precise torque control. Experiments have been conducted to imitate a
variety of human motions both in simulation and in a real-world humanoid robot.
These experiments demonstrate the capability of performing with accuracy and
adaptability, which validates the effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: The rapid iteration of autonomous vehicle (AV) deployments leads to
increasing needs for building realistic and scalable multi-agent traffic
simulators for efficient evaluation. Recent advances in this area focus on
closed-loop simulators that enable generating diverse and interactive
scenarios. This paper introduces Neural Interactive Agents (NIVA), a
probabilistic framework for multi-agent simulation driven by a hierarchical
Bayesian model that enables closed-loop, observation-conditioned simulation
through autoregressive sampling from a latent, finite mixture of Gaussian
distributions. We demonstrate how NIVA unifies preexisting sequence-to-sequence
trajectory prediction models and emerging closed-loop simulation models trained
on Next-token Prediction (NTP) from a Bayesian inference perspective.
Experiments on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset demonstrate that NIVA attains
competitive performance compared to the existing method while providing
embellishing control over intentions and driving styles.

*Samratul Fuady,Danesh Tarapore,Mohammad D. Soorati*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于子集的集体决策方法（SubCDM），通过动态构建子集减少资源消耗，同时保持决策准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有集体决策方法需要所有机器人参与，资源消耗大且无法分配机器人执行其他任务。

Method: 动态构建子集，仅依赖局部信息，自适应调整子集大小以适应决策难度。

Result: 仿真实验表明，SubCDM在减少机器人使用量的同时，保持了与全群决策相当的准确性。

Conclusion: SubCDM是一种资源高效的集体决策方法，适用于机器人群体。

Abstract: Collective decision-making is a key function of autonomous robot swarms,
enabling them to reach a consensus on actions based on environmental features.
Existing strategies require the participation of all robots in the
decision-making process, which is resource-intensive and prevents the swarm
from allocating the robots to any other tasks. We propose Subset-Based
Collective Decision-Making (SubCDM), which enables decisions using only a swarm
subset. The construction of the subset is dynamic and decentralized, relying
solely on local information. Our method allows the swarm to adaptively
determine the size of the subset for accurate decision-making, depending on the
difficulty of reaching a consensus. Simulation results using one hundred robots
show that our approach achieves accuracy comparable to using the entire swarm
while reducing the number of robots required to perform collective
decision-making, making it a resource-efficient solution for collective
decision-making in swarm robotics.

Abstract: Recent advancements in control of prosthetic hands have focused on increasing
autonomy through the use of cameras and other sensory inputs. These systems aim
to reduce the cognitive load on the user by automatically controlling certain
degrees of freedom. In robotics, imitation learning has emerged as a promising
approach for learning grasping and complex manipulation tasks while simplifying
data collection. Its application to the control of prosthetic hands remains,
however, largely unexplored. Bridging this gap could enhance dexterity
restoration and enable prosthetic devices to operate in more unconstrained
scenarios, where tasks are learned from demonstrations rather than relying on
manually annotated sequences. To this end, we present HannesImitationPolicy, an
imitation learning-based method to control the Hannes prosthetic hand, enabling
object grasping in unstructured environments. Moreover, we introduce the
HannesImitationDataset comprising grasping demonstrations in table, shelf, and
human-to-prosthesis handover scenarios. We leverage such data to train a single
diffusion policy and deploy it on the prosthetic hand to predict the wrist
orientation and hand closure for grasping. Experimental evaluation demonstrates
successful grasps across diverse objects and conditions. Finally, we show that
the policy outperforms a segmentation-based visual servo controller in
unstructured scenarios. Additional material is provided on our project page:

Abstract: Robot navigation in unstructured environments requires multimodal perception
systems that can support safe navigation. Multimodality enables the integration
of complementary information collected by different sensors. However, this
information must be processed by machine learning algorithms specifically
designed to leverage heterogeneous data. Furthermore, it is necessary to
identify which sensor modalities are most informative for navigation in the
target environment. In Martian exploration, thermal imagery has proven valuable
for assessing terrain safety due to differences in thermal behaviour between
soil types. This work presents OmniUnet, a transformer-based neural network
architecture for semantic segmentation using RGB, depth, and thermal (RGB-D-T)
imagery. A custom multimodal sensor housing was developed using 3D printing and
mounted on the Martian Rover Testbed for Autonomy (MaRTA) to collect a
multimodal dataset in the Bardenas semi-desert in northern Spain. This location
serves as a representative environment of the Martian surface, featuring
terrain types such as sand, bedrock, and compact soil. A subset of this dataset
was manually labeled to support supervised training of the network. The model
was evaluated both quantitatively and qualitatively, achieving a pixel accuracy
of 80.37% and demonstrating strong performance in segmenting complex
unstructured terrain. Inference tests yielded an average prediction time of 673
ms on a resource-constrained computer (Jetson Orin Nano), confirming its
suitability for on-robot deployment. The software implementation of the network
and the labeled dataset have been made publicly available to support future
research in multimodal terrain perception for planetary robotics.

Abstract: In this work, a control scheme for human-robot collaborative object
transportation is proposed, considering a quadruped robot equipped with the
MIGHTY suction cup that serves both as a gripper for holding the object and a
force/torque sensor. The proposed control scheme is based on the notion of
admittance control, and incorporates a variable damping term aiming towards
increasing the controllability of the human and, at the same time, decreasing
her/his effort. Furthermore, to ensure that the object is not detached from the
suction cup during the collaboration, an additional control signal is proposed,
which is based on a barrier artificial potential. The proposed control scheme
is proven to be passive and its performance is demonstrated through
experimental evaluations conducted using the Unitree Go1 robot equipped with
the MIGHTY suction cup.

Abstract: Recent work has shown that exoskeletons controlled through data-driven
methods can dynamically adapt assistance to various tasks for healthy young
adults. However, applying these methods to populations with neuromotor gait
deficits, such as post-stroke hemiparesis, is challenging. This is due not only
to high population heterogeneity and gait variability but also to a lack of
post-stroke gait datasets to train accurate models. Despite these challenges,
data-driven methods offer a promising avenue for control, potentially allowing
exoskeletons to function safely and effectively in unstructured community
settings. This work presents a first step towards enabling adaptive
plantarflexion and dorsiflexion assistance from data-driven torque estimation
during post-stroke walking. We trained a multi-task Temporal Convolutional
Network (TCN) using collected data from four post-stroke participants walking
on a treadmill ($R^2$ of $0.74 \pm 0.13$). The model uses data from three
inertial measurement units (IMU) and was pretrained on healthy walking data
from 6 participants. We implemented a wearable prototype for our ankle torque
estimation approach for exoskeleton control and demonstrated the viability of
real-time sensing, estimation, and actuation with one post-stroke participant.

Conclusion: LightDP为资源受限环境中扩散策略的实际部署提供了重要解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion Policies have significantly advanced robotic manipulation tasks via
imitation learning, but their application on resource-constrained mobile
platforms remains challenging due to computational inefficiency and extensive
memory footprint. In this paper, we propose LightDP, a novel framework
specifically designed to accelerate Diffusion Policies for real-time deployment
on mobile devices. LightDP addresses the computational bottleneck through two
core strategies: network compression of the denoising modules and reduction of
the required sampling steps. We first conduct an extensive computational
analysis on existing Diffusion Policy architectures, identifying the denoising
network as the primary contributor to latency. To overcome performance
degradation typically associated with conventional pruning methods, we
introduce a unified pruning and retraining pipeline, optimizing the model's
post-pruning recoverability explicitly. Furthermore, we combine pruning
techniques with consistency distillation to effectively reduce sampling steps
while maintaining action prediction accuracy. Experimental evaluations on the
standard datasets, \ie, PushT, Robomimic, CALVIN, and LIBERO, demonstrate that
LightDP achieves real-time action prediction on mobile devices with competitive
performance, marking an important step toward practical deployment of
diffusion-based policies in resource-limited environments. Extensive real-world
experiments also show the proposed LightDP can achieve performance comparable
to state-of-the-art Diffusion Policies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉运动策略在泛化和数据依赖方面存在局限，需要一种更高效、鲁棒的方法。

Result: 方法在仿真和现实中均表现出强泛化能力，显著提升样本效率和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 通过视频生成学习策略优于传统行为克隆，为机器人策略学习提供了更高效、可扩展的途径。

Abstract: Despite tremendous progress in dexterous manipulation, current visuomotor
policies remain fundamentally limited by two challenges: they struggle to
generalize under perceptual or behavioral distribution shifts, and their
performance is constrained by the size of human demonstration data. In this
paper, we use video generation as a proxy for robot policy learning to address
both limitations simultaneously. We propose Video Policy, a modular framework
that combines video and action generation that can be trained end-to-end. Our
results demonstrate that learning to generate videos of robot behavior allows
for the extraction of policies with minimal demonstration data, significantly
improving robustness and sample efficiency. Our method shows strong
generalization to unseen objects, backgrounds, and tasks, both in simulation
and the real world. We further highlight that task success is closely tied to
the generated video, with action-free video data providing critical benefits
for generalizing to novel tasks. By leveraging large-scale video generative
models, we achieve superior performance compared to traditional behavior
cloning, paving the way for more scalable and data-efficient robot policy
learning.

### [107] [Predicting Large-scale Urban Network Dynamics with Energy-informed Graph Neural Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00037)
*Tong Nie,Jian Sun,Wei Ma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于物理定律的、可扩展的时空Transformer模型（ScaleSTF），用于高效预测大规模城市网络的动态，解决了现有模型在效能与效率之间的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 城市网络系统涉及复杂且规则未知的过程，现有预测模型（如图神经网络）在效能与效率之间存在权衡，难以应用于大规模网络。

Method: 受物理定律启发，设计了一种基于Transformer结构的可解释神经扩散方案，其注意力层由低维嵌入诱导，具有线性复杂度。

Result: 在大规模城市系统（如交通流量、太阳能发电和智能电表）上验证了ScaleSTF的先进性能和卓越的可扩展性。

Conclusion: ScaleSTF为大规模城市网络动态预测提供了新视角，展示了其在效能与效率上的优势。

Abstract: Networked urban systems facilitate the flow of people, resources, and
services, and are essential for economic and social interactions. These systems
often involve complex processes with unknown governing rules, observed by
sensor-based time series. To aid decision-making in industrial and engineering
contexts, data-driven predictive models are used to forecast spatiotemporal
dynamics of urban systems. Current models such as graph neural networks have
shown promise but face a trade-off between efficacy and efficiency due to
computational demands. Hence, their applications in large-scale networks still
require further efforts. This paper addresses this trade-off challenge by
drawing inspiration from physical laws to inform essential model designs that
align with fundamental principles and avoid architectural redundancy. By
understanding both micro- and macro-processes, we present a principled
interpretable neural diffusion scheme based on Transformer-like structures
whose attention layers are induced by low-dimensional embeddings. The proposed
scalable spatiotemporal Transformer (ScaleSTF), with linear complexity, is
validated on large-scale urban systems including traffic flow, solar power, and
smart meters, showing state-of-the-art performance and remarkable scalability.
Our results constitute a fresh perspective on the dynamics prediction in
large-scale urban networks.

*Kaustav Chatterjee,Joshua Q. Li,Fatemeh Ansari,Masud Rana Munna,Kundan Parajulee,Jared Schwennesen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究提出了一种结合LSTM和Transformer的混合深度学习框架，用于高效测量HRGC剖面，以解决传统方法的高成本和安全问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统HRGC剖面测量方法成本高、耗时长且存在安全隐患，需要一种更高效、低成本的技术。

Method: 开发了三种混合深度学习模型（Transformer-LSTM、LSTM-Transformer序列和并行模型），利用IMU和GPS传感器数据与地面真实数据对比。

Result: 模型2和3表现最佳，能生成2D/3D HRGC剖面，显著提升了测量效率和安全性。

Conclusion: 该深度学习框架为HRGC剖面测量提供了一种快速、准确的解决方案，有望提升公路和铁路安全性。

Abstract: Hump crossings, or high-profile Highway Railway Grade Crossings (HRGCs), pose
safety risks to highway vehicles due to potential hang-ups. These crossings
typically result from post-construction railway track maintenance activities or
non-compliance with design guidelines for HRGC vertical alignments.
Conventional methods for measuring HRGC profiles are costly, time-consuming,
traffic-disruptive, and present safety challenges. To address these issues,
this research employed advanced, cost-effective techniques and innovative
modeling approaches for HRGC profile measurement. A novel hybrid deep learning
framework combining Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Transformer architectures
was developed by utilizing instrumentation and ground truth data.
Instrumentation data were gathered using a highway testing vehicle equipped
with Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) and Global Positioning System (GPS)
sensors, while ground truth data were obtained via an industrial-standard
walking profiler. Field data was collected at the Red Rock Railroad Corridor in
Oklahoma. Three advanced deep learning models Transformer-LSTM sequential
(model 1), LSTM-Transformer sequential (model 2), and LSTM-Transformer parallel
(model 3) were evaluated to identify the most efficient architecture. Models 2
and 3 outperformed the others and were deployed to generate 2D/3D HRGC
profiles. The deep learning models demonstrated significant potential to
enhance highway and railroad safety by enabling rapid and accurate assessment
of HRGC hang-up susceptibility.

TL;DR: 该研究结合贝叶斯机制检测与条件神经过程，用于德国市场24小时电价预测，提出R-NP模型，并通过多标准评估显示其综合性能最优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决电价预测中因市场机制变化导致的预测不准确问题，并提升预测结果在实际运营中的实用性。

Method: 使用DS-HDP-HMM进行机制检测，每个机制由独立的CNP建模，最终预测为机制加权的CNP输出混合。

Result: R-NP在2021-2023年表现最均衡，优于DNN和LEAR模型。

Conclusion: R-NP模型在多标准评估中表现最佳，适合长期电价预测和实际运营应用。

Abstract: This work integrates Bayesian regime detection with conditional neural
processes for 24-hour electricity price prediction in the German market. Our
methodology integrates regime detection using a disentangled sticky
hierarchical Dirichlet process hidden Markov model (DS-HDP-HMM) applied to
daily electricity prices. Each identified regime is subsequently modeled by an
independent conditional neural process (CNP), trained to learn localized
mappings from input contexts to 24-dimensional hourly price trajectories, with
final predictions computed as regime-weighted mixtures of these CNP outputs. We
rigorously evaluate R-NP against deep neural networks (DNN) and Lasso estimated
auto-regressive (LEAR) models by integrating their forecasts into diverse
battery storage optimization frameworks, including price arbitrage, risk
management, grid services, and cost minimization. This operational utility
assessment revealed complex performance trade-offs: LEAR often yielded superior
absolute profits or lower costs, while DNN showed exceptional optimality in
specific cost-minimization contexts. Recognizing that raw prediction accuracy
doesn't always translate to optimal operational outcomes, we employed TOPSIS as
a comprehensive multi-criteria evaluation layer. Our TOPSIS analysis identified
LEAR as the top-ranked model for 2021, but crucially, our proposed R-NP model
emerged as the most balanced and preferred solution for 2021, 2022 and 2023.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DevFT是一种资源高效的联邦微调方法，通过分阶段的子模型优化和知识转移，显著提升了LLMs的性能和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决联邦微调在边缘设备上资源密集的问题，同时保持数据隐私。

Method: 采用分阶段的子模型优化，通过知识转移和层分组/融合技术构建高效模型。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，DevFT实现了更快的收敛速度、更低的通信开销和更高的性能。

Conclusion: DevFT是一种高效且兼容现有方法的联邦微调解决方案。

Abstract: Federated fine-tuning enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to adapt to
downstream tasks while preserving data privacy, but its resource-intensive
nature limits deployment on edge devices. In this paper, we introduce
Developmental Federated Tuning (DevFT), a resource-efficient approach inspired
by cognitive development that progressively builds a powerful LLM from a
compact foundation. DevFT decomposes the fine-tuning process into developmental
stages, each optimizing submodels with increasing parameter capacity. Knowledge
from earlier stages transfers to subsequent submodels, providing optimized
initialization parameters that prevent convergence to local minima and
accelerate training. This paradigm mirrors human learning, gradually
constructing comprehensive knowledge structure while refining existing skills.
To efficiently build stage-specific submodels, DevFT introduces
deconfliction-guided layer grouping and differential-based layer fusion to
distill essential information and construct representative layers. Evaluations
across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that DevFT significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to 4.59$\times$ faster convergence,
10.67$\times$ reduction in communication overhead, and 9.07% average
performance improvement, while maintaining compatibility with existing
approaches.

*Nhut Truong,Uri Hasson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究比较了两种空间约束（权重相似性和激活相似性）对地形卷积神经网络的影响，发现权重相似性在鲁棒性、输入敏感性和功能定位方面表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨不同地形约束对神经网络学习表示的影响，填补系统性研究的空白。

Method: 比较权重相似性（WS）和激活相似性（AS）两种约束，评估分类准确性、鲁棒性和表示的空间组织。

Result: WS在噪声鲁棒性、输入敏感性和功能定位方面优于AS和标准CNN，且影响网络的表示几何。

Conclusion: 权重相似性约束能产生更鲁棒的表示，对生物物理启发模型的特征学习和功能组织有重要影响。

Abstract: Topographic neural networks are computational models that can simulate the
spatial and functional organization of the brain. Topographic constraints in
neural networks can be implemented in multiple ways, with potentially different
impacts on the representations learned by the network. The impact of such
different implementations has not been systematically examined. To this end,
here we compare topographic convolutional neural networks trained with two
spatial constraints: Weight Similarity (WS), which pushes neighboring units to
develop similar incoming weights, and Activation Similarity (AS), which
enforces similarity in unit activations. We evaluate the resulting models on
classification accuracy, robustness to weight perturbations and input
degradation, and the spatial organization of learned representations. Compared
to both AS and standard CNNs, WS provided three main advantages: i) improved
robustness to noise, also showing higher accuracy under weight corruption; ii)
greater input sensitivity, reflected in higher activation variance; and iii)
stronger functional localization, with units showing similar activations
positioned at closer distances. In addition, WS produced differences in
orientation tuning, symmetry sensitivity, and eccentricity profiles of units,
indicating an influence of this spatial constraint on the representational
geometry of the network. Our findings suggest that during end-to-end training,
WS constraints produce more robust representations than AS or non-topographic
CNNs. These findings also suggest that weight-based spatial constraints can
shape feature learning and functional organization in biophysical inspired
models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个用于评估强化学习算法在部分可观测性下性能的基准框架POBAX，强调覆盖多种部分可观测性形式和环境的内存可改进性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评估部分可观测性的基准过于简单，无法反映真实场景中的复杂性，因此需要更全面的基准来衡量算法进展。

Method: 提出了POBAX开源库，包含多种代表性环境（如定位与映射、视觉控制、游戏等），并确保这些任务具有内存可改进性。

Result: POBAX提供了快速评估的工具和GPU可扩展的实验环境，展示了这些任务需要难以学习的内存功能。

Conclusion: POBAX为部分可观测性研究提供了实用的基准框架和工具，推动了该领域的发展。

Abstract: Mitigating partial observability is a necessary but challenging task for
general reinforcement learning algorithms. To improve an algorithm's ability to
mitigate partial observability, researchers need comprehensive benchmarks to
gauge progress. Most algorithms tackling partial observability are only
evaluated on benchmarks with simple forms of state aliasing, such as feature
masking and Gaussian noise. Such benchmarks do not represent the many forms of
partial observability seen in real domains, like visual occlusion or unknown
opponent intent. We argue that a partially observable benchmark should have two
key properties. The first is coverage in its forms of partial observability, to
ensure an algorithm's generalizability. The second is a large gap between the
performance of a agents with more or less state information, all other factors
roughly equal. This gap implies that an environment is memory improvable: where
performance gains in a domain are from an algorithm's ability to cope with
partial observability as opposed to other factors. We introduce best-practice
guidelines for empirically benchmarking reinforcement learning under partial
observability, as well as the open-source library POBAX: Partially Observable
Benchmarks in JAX. We characterize the types of partial observability present
in various environments and select representative environments for our
benchmark. These environments include localization and mapping, visual control,
games, and more. Additionally, we show that these tasks are all memory
improvable and require hard-to-learn memory functions, providing a concrete
signal for partial observability research. This framework includes recommended
hyperparameters as well as algorithm implementations for fast, out-of-the-box
evaluation, as well as highly performant environments implemented in JAX for
GPU-scalable experimentation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于大型语言模型（LLM）的无监督时间序列异常检测框架TriP-LLM，通过三分支设计整合局部和全局特征，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着物联网和智能制造的普及，时间序列数据的规模和维度急剧增加，传统统计方法难以处理其高异质性和复杂性。

Method: TriP-LLM通过三分支设计（Patching、Selection、Global）将时间序列编码为分块标记，利用预训练的LLM处理，并通过轻量级解码器重构输入以计算异常分数。

Result: 实验表明，TriP-LLM在多个公共基准数据集上优于现有方法，且内存消耗更低。

Conclusion: TriP-LLM展示了LLM在时间序列异常检测中的潜力，适用于GPU内存受限的环境。

Abstract: Time-series anomaly detection plays a central role across a wide range of
application domains. With the increasing proliferation of the Internet of
Things (IoT) and smart manufacturing, time-series data has dramatically
increased in both scale and dimensionality. This growth has exposed the
limitations of traditional statistical methods in handling the high
heterogeneity and complexity of such data. Inspired by the recent success of
large language models (LLMs) in multimodal tasks across language and vision
domains, we propose a novel unsupervised anomaly detection framework: A
Tri-Branch Patch-wise Large Language Model Framework for Time-Series Anomaly
Detection (TriP-LLM). TriP-LLM integrates local and global temporal features
through a tri-branch design-Patching, Selection, and Global-to encode the input
time series into patch-wise tokens, which are then processed by a frozen,
pretrained LLM. A lightweight patch-wise decoder reconstructs the input, from
which anomaly scores are derived. We evaluate TriP-LLM on several public
benchmark datasets using PATE, a recently proposed threshold-free evaluation
metric, and conduct all comparisons within a unified open-source framework to
ensure fairness. Experimental results show that TriP-LLM consistently
outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods across all datasets, demonstrating
strong detection capabilities. Furthermore, through extensive ablation studies,
we verify the substantial contribution of the LLM to the overall architecture.
Compared to LLM-based approaches using Channel Independence (CI) patch
processing, TriP-LLM achieves significantly lower memory consumption, making it
more suitable for GPU memory-constrained environments. All code and model
checkpoints are publicly available on https://github.com/YYZStart/TriP-LLM.git

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种结合LightGBM回归模型和遗传算法优化的新方法，用于评估COVID-19相关指标对比特币回报预测的贡献。结果显示，疫情指标显著提升了预测准确性，尤其是疫苗接种数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在确定疫情相关健康数据是否能显著提升比特币回报预测的准确性，而不仅仅是预测回报本身。

Method: 使用LightGBM回归模型和遗传算法优化，构建包含比特币回报和COVID-19指标的全面数据集，并通过31次独立运行进行统计评估。

Result: COVID-19指标显著提高了模型性能（R2增加40%，RMSE降低2%），其中疫苗接种数据是主要预测因子。

Conclusion: 该方法通过整合公共卫生信号扩展了金融分析工具，为投资者和政策制定者在系统性危机中提供了更精细的市场指标。

Abstract: This study proposes a novel methodological framework integrating a LightGBM
regression model and genetic algorithm (GA) optimization to systematically
evaluate the contribution of COVID-19-related indicators to Bitcoin return
prediction. The primary objective was not merely to forecast Bitcoin returns
but rather to determine whether including pandemic-related health data
significantly enhances prediction accuracy. A comprehensive dataset comprising
daily Bitcoin returns and COVID-19 metrics (vaccination rates,
hospitalizations, testing statistics) was constructed. Predictive models,
trained with and without COVID-19 features, were optimized using GA over 31
independent runs, allowing robust statistical assessment. Performance metrics
(R2, RMSE, MAE) were statistically compared through distribution overlaps and
Mann-Whitney U tests. Permutation Feature Importance (PFI) analysis quantified
individual feature contributions. Results indicate that COVID-19 indicators
significantly improved model performance, particularly in capturing extreme
market fluctuations (R2 increased by 40%, RMSE decreased by 2%, both highly
significant statistically). Among COVID-19 features, vaccination metrics,
especially the 75th percentile of fully vaccinated individuals, emerged as
dominant predictors. The proposed methodology extends existing financial
analytics tools by incorporating public health signals, providing investors and
policymakers with refined indicators to navigate market uncertainty during
systemic crises.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受材料科学中弹性与塑性变形启发，解决深度神经网络在训练过程中因优化困难而陷入尖锐极小值的问题。

Method: 提出Plastic Deformation Optimizer，通过内部应力信号检测训练停滞，并注入自适应噪声以帮助模型逃离尖锐极小值。

Result: 在六种架构、四种优化器和七个视觉基准测试中验证了方法的鲁棒性和泛化能力提升，且计算开销小。

Conclusion: Stress-Aware Learning通过动态调整优化行为，有效提升了模型的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: This paper introduces Stress-Aware Learning, a resilient neural training
paradigm in which deep neural networks dynamically adjust their optimization
behavior - whether under stable training regimes or in settings with uncertain
dynamics - based on the concept of Temporary (Elastic) and Permanent (Plastic)
Deformation, inspired by structural fatigue in materials science. To
instantiate this concept, we propose Plastic Deformation Optimizer, a
stress-aware mechanism that injects adaptive noise into model parameters
whenever an internal stress signal - reflecting stagnation in training loss and
accuracy - indicates persistent optimization difficulty. This enables the model
to escape sharp minima and converge toward flatter, more generalizable regions
of the loss landscape. Experiments across six architectures, four optimizers,
and seven vision benchmarks demonstrate improved robustness and generalization
with minimal computational overhead. The code and 3D visuals will be available
on GitHub: https://github.com/Stress-Aware-Learning/SAL.

Conclusion: StackLiverNet在肝病检测中表现出色，具有高解释性和实用性，适用于临床实践。

Abstract: Liver diseases are a serious health concern in the world, which requires
precise and timely diagnosis to enhance the survival chances of patients. The
current literature implemented numerous machine learning and deep learning
models to classify liver diseases, but most of them had some issues like high
misclassification error, poor interpretability, prohibitive computational
expense, and lack of good preprocessing strategies. In order to address these
drawbacks, we introduced StackLiverNet in this study; an interpretable stacked
ensemble model tailored to the liver disease detection task. The framework uses
advanced data preprocessing and feature selection technique to increase model
robustness and predictive ability. Random undersampling is performed to deal
with class imbalance and make the training balanced. StackLiverNet is an
ensemble of several hyperparameter-optimized base classifiers, whose
complementary advantages are used through a LightGBM meta-model. The provided
model demonstrates excellent performance, with the testing accuracy of 99.89%,
Cohen Kappa of 0.9974, and AUC of 0.9993, having only 5 misclassifications, and
efficient training and inference speeds that are amenable to clinical practice
(training time 4.2783 seconds, inference time 0.1106 seconds). Besides, Local
Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) are applied to generate
transparent explanations of individual predictions, revealing high
concentrations of Alkaline Phosphatase and moderate SGOT as important
observations of liver disease. Also, SHAP was used to rank features by their
global contribution to predictions, while the Morris method confirmed the most
influential features through sensitivity analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当代神经网络缺乏结构保障，导致学习不稳定和行为难以解释，需要一种更稳定的方法。

Method: 将层变换分解为结构化线性算子和残差修正组件，支持稳定信息流。

Result: 实验表明，该方法改善了梯度条件、降低扰动敏感性，并增强了层间鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法为优先稳定性和透明性的神经网络架构提供了新工具，不牺牲表达能力。

Abstract: Despite their impressive performance, contemporary neural networks often lack
structural safeguards that promote stable learning and interpretable behavior.
In this work, we introduce a reformulation of layer-level transformations that
departs from the standard unconstrained affine paradigm. Each transformation is
decomposed into a structured linear operator and a residual corrective
component, enabling more disciplined signal propagation and improved training
dynamics. Our formulation encourages internal consistency and supports stable
information flow across depth, while remaining fully compatible with standard
learning objectives and backpropagation. Through a series of synthetic and
real-world experiments, we demonstrate that models constructed with these
structured transformations exhibit improved gradient conditioning, reduced
sensitivity to perturbations, and layer-wise robustness. We further show that
these benefits persist across architectural scales and training regimes. This
study serves as a foundation for a more principled class of neural
architectures that prioritize stability and transparency-offering new tools for
reasoning about learning behavior without sacrificing expressive power.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究通过PCA和变分自编码器（VAE）简化ECG数据，提出三种VAE变体，其中A beta-VAE在信号重建上表现最佳，SAE结合传统特征提升了LVEF预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决ECG信号高复杂性和个体差异在深度学习中的挑战，尤其是在小数据集情况下。

Method: 使用PCA和三种新型VAE（SAE、A beta-VAE、C beta-VAE）简化数据，结合LGBM进行预测任务。

Result: A beta-VAE信号重建误差低至15.7±3.2 μV，SAE结合传统特征在LVEF预测中AUROC达0.901。

Conclusion: VAE编码有效简化ECG数据，为小规模标注数据下的深度学习提供实用方案。

Abstract: The electrocardiogram (ECG) is an inexpensive and widely available tool for
cardiac assessment. Despite its standardized format and small file size, the
high complexity and inter-individual variability of ECG signals (typically a
60,000-size vector with 12 leads at 500 Hz) make it challenging to use in deep
learning models, especially when only small training datasets are available.
This study addresses these challenges by exploring feature generation methods
from representative beat ECGs, focusing on Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
and Autoencoders to reduce data complexity. We introduce three novel
Variational Autoencoder (VAE) variants-Stochastic Autoencoder (SAE), Annealed
beta-VAE (A beta-VAE), and Cyclical beta VAE (C beta-VAE)-and compare their
effectiveness in maintaining signal fidelity and enhancing downstream
prediction tasks using a Light Gradient Boost Machine (LGBM). The A beta-VAE
achieved superior signal reconstruction, reducing the mean absolute error (MAE)
to 15.7+/-3.2 muV, which is at the level of signal noise. Moreover, the SAE
encodings, when combined with traditional ECG summary features, improved the
prediction of reduced Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF), achieving an
holdout test set area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC)
of 0.901 with a LGBM classifier. This performance nearly matches the 0.909
AUROC of state-of-the-art CNN model but requires significantly less
computational resources. Further, the ECG feature extraction-LGBM pipeline
avoids overfitting and retains predictive performance when trained with less
data. Our findings demonstrate that these VAE encodings are not only effective
in simplifying ECG data but also provide a practical solution for applying deep
learning in contexts with limited-scale labeled training data.

Conclusion: INSPIRE-GNN为交通规划者提供了优化传感器网络和提升数据可靠性的有效工具。

Abstract: Accurate link-level bicycling volume estimation is essential for sustainable
urban transportation planning. However, many cities face significant challenges
of high data sparsity due to limited bicycling count sensor coverage. To
address this issue, we propose INSPIRE-GNN, a novel Reinforcement Learning
(RL)-boosted hybrid Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework designed to optimize
sensor placement and improve link-level bicycling volume estimation in
data-sparse environments. INSPIRE-GNN integrates Graph Convolutional Networks
(GCN) and Graph Attention Networks (GAT) with a Deep Q-Network (DQN)-based RL
agent, enabling a data-driven strategic selection of sensor locations to
maximize estimation performance. Applied to Melbourne's bicycling network,
comprising 15,933 road segments with sensor coverage on only 141 road segments
(99% sparsity) - INSPIRE-GNN demonstrates significant improvements in volume
estimation by strategically selecting additional sensor locations in
deployments of 50, 100, 200 and 500 sensors. Our framework outperforms
traditional heuristic methods for sensor placement such as betweenness
centrality, closeness centrality, observed bicycling activity and random
placement, across key metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean
Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). Furthermore, our
experiments benchmark INSPIRE-GNN against standard machine learning and deep
learning models in the bicycle volume estimation performance, underscoring its
effectiveness. Our proposed framework provides transport planners actionable
insights to effectively expand sensor networks, optimize sensor placement and

*Ziqian Zhong,Aditi Raghunathan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于权重而非激活的新方法，用于理解和监控微调后的LLMs，无需依赖与训练数据分布相似的输入数据。该方法通过分析权重差异的奇异向量检测新行为，并在后门攻击检测和遗忘模型监控中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于激活的解释方法需要与训练数据分布相似的输入，限制了其在检测新型威胁（如后门）中的应用。

Method: 通过分析微调模型与基础模型权重差异的奇异向量，检测新行为，并监控激活的余弦相似度。

Result: 在后门攻击检测中阻止100%攻击（假阳性率低于1.2%）；在遗忘模型检测中准确率达95.42%，并能恢复“遗忘”信息。

Conclusion: 该方法为模型监控和预部署审计提供了新工具，展示了在商业模型分析中的潜力。

Abstract: The releases of powerful open-weight large language models (LLMs) are often
not accompanied by access to their full training data. Existing
interpretability methods, particularly those based on activations, often
require or assume distributionally similar data. This is a significant
limitation when detecting and defending against novel potential threats like
backdoors, which are by definition out-of-distribution.
  In this work, we introduce a new method for understanding, monitoring and
controlling fine-tuned LLMs that interprets weights, rather than activations,
thereby side stepping the need for data that is distributionally similar to the
unknown training data. We demonstrate that the top singular vectors of the
weight difference between a fine-tuned model and its base model correspond to
newly acquired behaviors. By monitoring the cosine similarity of activations
along these directions, we can detect salient behaviors introduced during
fine-tuning with high precision.
  For backdoored models that bypasses safety mechanisms when a secret trigger
is present, our method stops up to 100% of attacks with a false positive rate
below 1.2%. For models that have undergone unlearning, we detect inference on
erased topics with accuracy up to 95.42% and can even steer the model to
recover "unlearned" information. Besides monitoring, our method also shows
potential for pre-deployment model auditing: by analyzing commercial
instruction-tuned models (OLMo, Llama, Qwen), we are able to uncover
model-specific fine-tuning focus including marketing strategies and Midjourney
prompt generation.

Method: 开发了医学增强的压缩和去噪模块，以提升带宽效率和鲁棒性。

Result: 实验验证了DiSC-Med在真实医学数据集上的高效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: DiSC-Med在远程医疗应用中展现出高效和鲁棒的潜力。

Abstract: The rapid development of artificial intelligence has driven smart health with
next-generation wireless communication technologies, stimulating exciting
applications in remote diagnosis and intervention. To enable a timely and
effective response for remote healthcare, efficient transmission of medical
data through noisy channels with limited bandwidth emerges as a critical
challenge. In this work, we propose a novel diffusion-based semantic
communication framework, namely DiSC-Med, for the medical image transmission,
where medical-enhanced compression and denoising blocks are developed for
bandwidth efficiency and robustness, respectively. Unlike conventional
pixel-wise communication framework, our proposed DiSC-Med is able to capture
the key semantic information and achieve superior reconstruction performance
with ultra-high bandwidth efficiency against noisy channels. Extensive
experiments on real-world medical datasets validate the effectiveness of our
framework, demonstrating its potential for robust and efficient telehealth
applications.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种将回归问题转化为强化学习（RL）问题的新方法，通过自定义奖励信号和RL算法解决传统回归方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统回归方法受限于预定义的可微损失函数（如均方误差），难以处理非对称成本或复杂、不可微的目标。

Method: 将模型预测视为动作，基于预测误差定义自定义奖励信号，利用RL算法（如Actor-Critic）进行函数逼近，并通过案例研究逐步优化。

Result: RL框架不仅成功解决了回归问题，还提供了定义目标和指导学习过程的更大灵活性。

Conclusion: 强化学习为回归问题提供了一种灵活且有效的替代方案，尤其在处理复杂目标时表现出色。

Abstract: Standard regression techniques, while powerful, are often constrained by
predefined, differentiable loss functions such as mean squared error. These
functions may not fully capture the desired behavior of a system, especially
when dealing with asymmetric costs or complex, non-differentiable objectives.
In this paper, we explore an alternative paradigm: framing regression as a
Reinforcement Learning (RL) problem. We demonstrate this by treating a model's
prediction as an action and defining a custom reward signal based on the
prediction error, and we can leverage powerful RL algorithms to perform
function approximation. Through a progressive case study of learning a noisy
sine wave, we illustrate the development of an Actor-Critic agent, iteratively
enhancing it with Prioritized Experience Replay, increased network capacity,
and positional encoding to enable a capable RL agent for this regression task.
Our results show that the RL framework not only successfully solves the
regression problem but also offers enhanced flexibility in defining objectives
and guiding the learning process.

Result: 实验表明BEMA在收敛速度和最终性能上显著优于EMA和普通训练。

Conclusion: BEMA是一种实用且理论支持的方法，可提升语言模型微调的稳定性和效率。

Abstract: Stochasticity in language model fine-tuning, often caused by the small batch
sizes typically used in this regime, can destabilize training by introducing
large oscillations in generation quality. A popular approach to mitigating this
instability is to take an Exponential moving average (EMA) of weights
throughout training. While EMA reduces stochasticity, thereby smoothing
training, the introduction of bias from old iterates often creates a lag in
optimization relative to vanilla training. In this work, we propose the
Bias-Corrected Exponential Moving Average (BEMA), a simple and practical
augmentation of EMA that retains variance-reduction benefits while eliminating
bias. BEMA is motivated by a simple theoretical model wherein we demonstrate
provable acceleration of BEMA over both a standard EMA and vanilla training.
Through an extensive suite of experiments on Language Models, we show that BEMA
leads to significantly improved convergence rates and final performance over
both EMA and vanilla training in a variety of standard LM benchmarks, making
BEMA a practical and theoretically motivated intervention for more stable and
efficient fine-tuning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推荐系统主要依赖监督学习，难以优化长期目标（如会话参与度），而强化学习在大规模应用中面临工程复杂性挑战。

Method: RecoMind利用现有推荐模型构建模拟环境，并通过自定义探索策略高效优化大规模动作空间。

Result: 离线模拟和在线A/B测试显示，RecoMind训练的RL策略显著优于传统监督学习方法，提升会话深度和观看时长。

Conclusion: RecoMind为大规模推荐系统提供了一种可扩展的强化学习解决方案，有效优化会话用户满意度。

Abstract: Existing web-scale recommendation systems commonly use supervised learning
methods that prioritize immediate user feedback. Although reinforcement
learning (RL) offers a solution to optimize longer-term goals, such as
in-session engagement, applying it at web scale is challenging due to the
extremely large action space and engineering complexity. In this paper, we
introduce RecoMind, a simulator-based RL framework designed for the effective
optimization of session-based goals at web-scale. RecoMind leverages existing
recommendation models to establish a simulation environment and to bootstrap
the RL policy to optimize immediate user interactions from the outset. This
method integrates well with existing industry pipelines, simplifying the
training and deployment of RL policies. Additionally, RecoMind introduces a
custom exploration strategy to efficiently explore web-scale action spaces with
hundreds of millions of items. We evaluated RecoMind through extensive offline
simulations and online A/B testing on a video streaming platform. Both methods
showed that the RL policy trained using RecoMind significantly outperforms
traditional supervised learning recommendation approaches in in-session user
satisfaction. In online A/B tests, the RL policy increased videos watched for
more than 10 seconds by 15.81\% and improved session depth by 4.71\% for
sessions with at least 10 interactions. As a result, RecoMind presents a
systematic and scalable approach for embedding RL into web-scale recommendation
systems, showing great promise for optimizing session-based user satisfaction.

TL;DR: 提出了一种两阶段框架，利用几何信息在标签噪声下实现鲁棒分类，无需重新训练模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在标签噪声环境下，利用基础模型（FM）的嵌入和局部几何信息提升分类性能。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：可靠性估计和可靠性加权推理，引入非负核（NNK）邻域构建。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和DermaMNIST上，方法优于标准K-NN和自适应邻域基线。

Conclusion: 通过几何信息和可靠性加权，显著提升了标签噪声下的分类鲁棒性。

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) pretrained on large datasets have become fundamental
for various downstream machine learning tasks, in particular in scenarios where
obtaining perfectly labeled data is prohibitively expensive. In this paper, we
assume an FM has to be fine-tuned with noisy data and present a two-stage
framework to ensure robust classification in the presence of label noise
without model retraining. Recent work has shown that simple k-nearest neighbor
(kNN) approaches using an embedding derived from an FM can achieve good
performance even in the presence of severe label noise. Our work is motivated
by the fact that these methods make use of local geometry. In this paper,
following a similar two-stage procedure, reliability estimation followed by
reliability-weighted inference, we show that improved performance can be
achieved by introducing geometry information. For a given instance, our
proposed inference uses a local neighborhood of training data, obtained using
the non-negative kernel (NNK) neighborhood construction. We propose several
methods for reliability estimation that can rely less on distance and local
neighborhood as the label noise increases. Our evaluation on CIFAR-10 and
DermaMNIST shows that our methods improve robustness across various noise
conditions, surpassing standard K-NN approaches and recent
adaptive-neighborhood baselines.

Result: KRAdapter在视觉语言模型和大语言模型中表现优于LoRA，尤其在未见常识推理任务上。

Conclusion: KRAdapter是一种高效且实用的PEFT方法，适用于大规模参数模型的微调。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has become a standard approach for
adapting large pre-trained models. Amongst PEFT methods, low-rank adaptation
(LoRA) has achieved notable success. However, recent studies have highlighted
its limitations compared against full-rank alternatives, particularly when
applied to multimodal and large language models. In this work, we present a
quantitative comparison amongst full-rank and low-rank PEFT methods using a
synthetic matrix approximation benchmark with controlled spectral properties.
Our results confirm that LoRA struggles to approximate matrices with relatively
flat spectrums or high frequency components -- signs of high effective ranks.
To this end, we introduce KRAdapter, a novel PEFT algorithm that leverages the
Khatri-Rao product to produce weight updates, which, by construction, tends to
produce matrix product with a high effective rank. We demonstrate performance
gains with KRAdapter on vision-language models up to 1B parameters and on large
language models up to 8B parameters, particularly on unseen common-sense
reasoning tasks. In addition, KRAdapter maintains the memory and compute
efficiency of LoRA, making it a practical and robust alternative to fine-tune
billion-scale parameter models.

Result: 标签平滑能有效维持校准，但在大词汇量LLM中效果受限，需进一步优化。

Conclusion: 标签平滑是解决校准问题的实用方法，但需针对大词汇量模型优化，同时定制内核可显著降低内存占用。

Abstract: Recent advances in natural language processing (NLP) have opened up greater
opportunities to enable fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) to behave as
more powerful interactive agents through improved instruction-following
ability. However, understanding how this impacts confidence calibration for
reliable model output has not been researched in full. In this work, we examine
various open-sourced LLMs, identifying significant calibration degradation
after instruction tuning in each. Seeking a practical solution, we look towards
label smoothing, which has been shown as an effective method to regularize for
overconfident predictions but has yet to be widely adopted in the supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) of LLMs. We first provide insight as to why label smoothing
is sufficient to maintain calibration throughout the SFT process. However,
settings remain where the effectiveness of smoothing is severely diminished, in
particular the case of large vocabulary LLMs (LV-LLMs). We posit the cause to
stem from the ability to become over-confident, which has a direct relationship
with the hidden size and vocabulary size, and justify this theoretically and
experimentally. Finally, we address an outstanding issue regarding the memory
footprint of the cross-entropy loss computation in the label smoothed loss
setting, designing a customized kernel to dramatically reduce memory
consumption without sacrificing speed or performance in comparison to existing
solutions for non-smoothed losses.

Result: 在166,000次练习会话中验证，MAB策略显著改善学生表现，但CB策略的个性化效果有限。

Conclusion: 数据驱动的反馈策略在大规模应用中有效，但个性化反馈的效果提升有限，未来需进一步优化。

Abstract: We present an online tutoring system that learns to provide effective
feedback to students after they answer questions incorrectly. Using data from
one million students, the system learns which assistance action (e.g., one of
multiple hints) to provide for each question to optimize student learning.
Employing the multi-armed bandit (MAB) framework and offline policy evaluation,
we assess 43,000 assistance actions, and identify trade-offs between assistance
policies optimized for different student outcomes (e.g., response correctness,
session completion). We design an algorithm that for each question decides on a
suitable policy training objective to enhance students' immediate second
attempt success and overall practice session performance. We evaluate the
resulting MAB policies in 166,000 practice sessions, verifying significant
improvements in student outcomes. While MAB policies optimize feedback for the
overall student population, we further investigate whether contextual bandit
(CB) policies can enhance outcomes by personalizing feedback based on
individual student features (e.g., ability estimates, response times). Using
causal inference, we examine (i) how effects of assistance actions vary across
students and (ii) whether CB policies, which leverage such effect
heterogeneity, outperform MAB policies. While our analysis reveals that some
actions for some questions exhibit effect heterogeneity, effect sizes may often
be too small for CB policies to provide significant improvements beyond what
well-optimized MAB policies that deliver the same action to all students
already achieve. We discuss insights gained from deploying data-driven systems
at scale and implications for future refinements. Today, the teaching policies
optimized by our system support thousands of students daily.

Abstract: This study presents a methodology to treat performance-based seismic design
as an inverse engineering problem, where design parameters are directly derived
to achieve specific performance objectives. By implementing explainable machine
learning models, this methodology directly maps design variables and
performance metrics, tackling computational inefficiencies of performance-based
design. The resultant machine learning model is integrated as an evaluation
function into a genetic optimization algorithm to solve the inverse problem.
The developed methodology is then applied to two different inventories of steel
and concrete moment frames in Los Angeles and Charleston to obtain sectional
properties of frame members that minimize expected annualized seismic loss in
terms of repair costs. The results show high accuracy of the surrogate models
(e.g., R2> 90%) across a diverse set of building types, geometries, seismic
design, and site hazard, where the optimization algorithm could identify the
optimum values of members' properties for a fixed set of geometric variables,
consistent with engineering principles.

Abstract: Graph Transformers (GTs) have demonstrated great effectiveness across various
graph analytical tasks. However, the existing GTs focus on training and testing
graph data originated from the same distribution, but fail to generalize under
distribution shifts. Graph invariant learning, aiming to capture generalizable
graph structural patterns with labels under distribution shifts, is potentially
a promising solution, but how to design attention mechanisms and positional and
structural encodings (PSEs) based on graph invariant learning principles
remains challenging. To solve these challenges, we introduce Graph
Out-Of-Distribution generalized Transformer (GOODFormer), aiming to learn
generalized graph representations by capturing invariant relationships between
predictive graph structures and labels through jointly optimizing three
modules. Specifically, we first develop a GT-based entropy-guided invariant
subgraph disentangler to separate invariant and variant subgraphs while
preserving the sharpness of the attention function. Next, we design an evolving
subgraph positional and structural encoder to effectively and efficiently
capture the encoding information of dynamically changing subgraphs during
training. Finally, we propose an invariant learning module utilizing subgraph
node representations and encodings to derive generalizable graph
representations that can to unseen graphs. We also provide theoretical
justifications for our method. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets
demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art baselines under
distribution shifts.

Conclusion: PnP-DA通过放松统计假设和利用历史数据，提供了一种高效的数据同化解决方案。

Abstract: Earth system modeling presents a fundamental challenge in scientific
computing: capturing complex, multiscale nonlinear dynamics in computationally
efficient models while minimizing forecast errors caused by necessary
simplifications. Even the most powerful AI- or physics-based forecast system
suffer from gradual error accumulation. Data assimilation (DA) aims to mitigate
these errors by optimally blending (noisy) observations with prior model
forecasts, but conventional variational methods often assume Gaussian error
statistics that fail to capture the true, non-Gaussian behavior of chaotic
dynamical systems. We propose PnP-DA, a Plug-and-Play algorithm that alternates
(1) a lightweight, gradient-based analysis update (using a Mahalanobis-distance
misfit on new observations) with (2) a single forward pass through a pretrained
generative prior conditioned on the background forecast via a conditional
Wasserstein coupling. This strategy relaxes restrictive statistical assumptions
and leverages rich historical data without requiring an explicit regularization
functional, and it also avoids the need to backpropagate gradients through the
complex neural network that encodes the prior during assimilation cycles.
Experiments on standard chaotic testbeds demonstrate that this strategy
consistently reduces forecast errors across a range of observation sparsities
and noise levels, outperforming classical variational methods.

Abstract: Understanding how language models develop their internal computational

susceptibilities, drawn from statistical physics, offer a promising analytical
tool, their full potential for visualizing network organization remains
untapped. In this work, we introduce an embryological approach, applying UMAP
to the susceptibility matrix to visualize the model's structural development
over training. Our visualizations reveal the emergence of a clear ``body

discovering previously unknown structures, such as a ``spacing fin'' dedicated
to counting space tokens. This work demonstrates that susceptibility analysis
can move beyond validation to uncover novel mechanisms, providing a powerful,

Result: 实验显示BOOD在CIFAR-100上FPR95降低29.64%，AUROC提升7.27%。

Conclusion: BOOD为OOD检测提供了一种高效且性能优越的数据生成方法。

Abstract: Harnessing the power of diffusion models to synthesize auxiliary training
data based on latent space features has proven effective in enhancing
out-of-distribution (OOD) detection performance. However, extracting effective
features outside the in-distribution (ID) boundary in latent space remains
challenging due to the difficulty of identifying decision boundaries between
classes. This paper proposes a novel framework called Boundary-based
Out-Of-Distribution data generation (BOOD), which synthesizes high-quality OOD
features and generates human-compatible outlier images using diffusion models.
BOOD first learns a text-conditioned latent feature space from the ID dataset,
selects ID features closest to the decision boundary, and perturbs them to
cross the decision boundary to form OOD features. These synthetic OOD features
are then decoded into images in pixel space by a diffusion model. Compared to
previous works, BOOD provides a more training efficient strategy for
synthesizing informative OOD features, facilitating clearer distinctions
between ID and OOD data. Extensive experimental results on common benchmarks
demonstrate that BOOD surpasses the state-of-the-art method significantly,
achieving a 29.64% decrease in average FPR95 (40.31% vs. 10.67%) and a 7.27%
improvement in average AUROC (90.15% vs. 97.42%) on the CIFAR-100 dataset.

Conclusion: SGPC通过理论性能界限和实验验证，显著提升了GNN在异质图上的表现，并具有线性计算复杂度。

Abstract: Over-smoothing in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) causes collapse in distinct
node features, particularly on heterophilic graphs where adjacent nodes often
have dissimilar labels. Although sheaf neural networks partially mitigate this
problem, they typically rely on static or heavily parameterized sheaf
structures that hinder generalization and scalability. Existing sheaf-based
models either predefine restriction maps or introduce excessive complexity, yet
fail to provide rigorous stability guarantees. In this paper, we introduce a
novel scheme called SGPC (Sheaf GNNs with PAC-Bayes Calibration), a unified
architecture that combines cellular-sheaf message passing with several
mechanisms, including optimal transport-based lifting, variance-reduced
diffusion, and PAC-Bayes spectral regularization for robust semi-supervised
node classification. We establish performance bounds theoretically and
demonstrate that the resulting bound-aware objective can be achieved via
end-to-end training in linear computational complexity. Experiments on nine
homophilic and heterophilic benchmarks show that SGPC outperforms
state-of-the-art spectral and sheaf-based GNNs while providing certified
confidence intervals on unseen nodes.

Conclusion: OID-PPO为室内设计提供了一种高效且灵活的解决方案，整合专家知识并优化布局。

Abstract: Designing residential interiors strongly impacts occupant satisfaction but
remains challenging due to unstructured spatial layouts, high computational
demands, and reliance on expert knowledge. Existing methods based on
optimization or deep learning are either computationally expensive or
constrained by data scarcity. Reinforcement learning (RL) approaches often
limit furniture placement to discrete positions and fail to incorporate design
principles adequately. We propose OID-PPO, a novel RL framework for Optimal
Interior Design using Proximal Policy Optimization, which integrates
expert-defined functional and visual guidelines into a structured reward
function. OID-PPO utilizes a diagonal Gaussian policy for continuous and
flexible furniture placement, effectively exploring latent environmental
dynamics under partial observability. Experiments conducted across diverse room
shapes and furniture configurations demonstrate that OID-PPO significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of layout quality and
computational efficiency. Ablation studies further demonstrate the impact of
structured guideline integration and reveal the distinct contributions of
individual design constraints.

Conclusion: 该框架扩展至在线复合优化，开发了通用算法以最小化复合函数的自适应遗憾。

Abstract: To deal with changing environments, a new performance measure -- adaptive
regret, defined as the maximum static regret over any interval, was proposed in
online learning. Under the setting of online convex optimization, several
algorithms have been successfully developed to minimize the adaptive regret.
However, existing algorithms lack universality in the sense that they can only
handle one type of convex functions and need apriori knowledge of parameters,
which hinders their application in real-world scenarios. To address this
limitation, this paper investigates universal algorithms with dual adaptivity,
which automatically adapt to the property of functions (convex, exponentially
concave, or strongly convex), as well as the nature of environments (stationary
or changing). Specifically, we propose a meta-expert framework for dual
adaptive algorithms, where multiple experts are created dynamically and
aggregated by a meta-algorithm. The meta-algorithm is required to yield a
second-order bound, which can accommodate unknown function types. We further
incorporate the technique of sleeping experts to capture the changing
environments. For the construction of experts, we introduce two strategies
(increasing the number of experts or enhancing the capabilities of experts) to
achieve universality. Theoretical analysis shows that our algorithms are able
to minimize the adaptive regret for multiple types of convex functions
simultaneously, and also allow the type of functions to switch between rounds.
Moreover, we extend our meta-expert framework to online composite optimization,
and develop a universal algorithm for minimizing the adaptive regret of
composite functions.

Abstract: Nowadays machine learning (ML) practitioners have access to numerous ML
libraries available online. Such libraries can be used to create ML pipelines
that consist of a series of steps where each step may invoke up to several ML
libraries that are used for various data-driven analytical tasks. Development
of high-quality ML pipelines is non-trivial; it requires training, ML
expertise, and careful development of each step. At the same time, domain
experts in science and engineering may not possess such ML expertise and
training while they are in pressing need of ML-based analytics. In this paper,
we present our ExeKGLib, a Python library enhanced with a graphical interface
layer that allows users with minimal ML knowledge to build ML pipelines. This
is achieved by relying on knowledge graphs that encode ML knowledge in simple
terms accessible to non-ML experts. ExeKGLib also allows improving the
transparency and reusability of the built ML workflows and ensures that they
are executable. We show the usability and usefulness of ExeKGLib by presenting
real use cases.

Motivation: 当前基于人类标注的强化学习方法在复杂任务中存在扩展性问题，而自奖励方法虽能激发大语言模型的推理能力，但容易崩溃。

Method: 提出Co-Reward框架，通过构造语义相似问题对，利用投票生成代理标签，并通过交叉引用问题对的标签来构建奖励，以增强推理一致性。

Result: 在多个推理基准测试和大语言模型系列中，Co-Reward表现优于其他自奖励基线方法，甚至在某些情况下超越基于真实标注的奖励，如在MATH500上比真实标注奖励提升6.8%。

Conclusion: Co-Reward通过自监督奖励机制有效避免了崩溃问题，提升了推理能力的稳定性和性能，为强化学习在大语言模型中的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Although reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) shows promise
in improving the reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs), the scaling
up dilemma remains due to the reliance on human annotated labels especially for
complex tasks. Recent alternatives that explore various self-reward signals
exhibit the eliciting potential of LLM reasoning, but suffer from the
non-negligible collapse issue. Inspired by the success of self-supervised
learning, we propose \textit{Co-Reward}, a novel RL framework that leverages
contrastive agreement across semantically analogical questions as a reward
basis. Specifically, we construct a similar question for each training sample
(without labels) and synthesize their individual surrogate labels through a
simple rollout voting, and then the reward is constructed by cross-referring
the labels of each question pair to enforce the internal reasoning consistency
across analogical inputs. Intuitively, such a self-supervised reward-shaping
mechanism increases the difficulty of learning collapse into a trivial
solution, and promotes stable reasoning elicitation and improvement through
expanding the input sample variants. Empirically, Co-Reward achieves superior
performance compared to other self-reward baselines on multiple reasoning
benchmarks and LLM series, and reaches or even surpasses ground-truth (GT)
labeled reward, with improvements of up to $+6.8\%$ on MATH500 over GT reward
on Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct. Our code is publicly available at

evaluate the contribution of individual components in the ResE-BiLSTM
architecture. Additionally, SHAP analysis was employed to interpret the

compared to baseline models, underscoring its practical value and applicability
in real-world scenarios.

Result: 在14个不平衡数据集上的评估表明，ctdGAN能生成高质量样本并显著提升分类准确率。

Conclusion: ctdGAN通过改进生成策略和损失函数，有效解决了表格数据中的类别不平衡问题，性能优于现有方法。

Abstract: The tabular form constitutes the standard way of representing data in
relational database systems and spreadsheets. But, similarly to other forms,
tabular data suffers from class imbalance, a problem that causes serious
performance degradation in a wide variety of machine learning tasks. One of the
most effective solutions dictates the usage of Generative Adversarial Networks
(GANs) in order to synthesize artificial data instances for the
under-represented classes. Despite their good performance, none of the proposed
GAN models takes into account the vector subspaces of the input samples in the
real data space, leading to data generation in arbitrary locations. Moreover,
the class labels are treated in the same manner as the other categorical
variables during training, so conditional sampling by class is rendered less
effective. To overcome these problems, this study presents ctdGAN, a
conditional GAN for alleviating class imbalance in tabular datasets. Initially,
ctdGAN executes a space partitioning step to assign cluster labels to the input
samples. Subsequently, it utilizes these labels to synthesize samples via a
novel probabilistic sampling strategy and a new loss function that penalizes
both cluster and class mis-predictions. In this way, ctdGAN is trained to
generate samples in subspaces that resemble those of the original data
distribution. We also introduce several other improvements, including a simple,
yet effective cluster-wise scaling technique that captures multiple feature
modes without affecting data dimensionality. The exhaustive evaluation of
ctdGAN with 14 imbalanced datasets demonstrated its superiority in generating
high fidelity samples and improving classification accuracy.

Result: 实验表明CoLL平均提升13.37%的AP值，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CoLL为LLMs在图异常检测中的应用开辟了新途径，展示了多模态融合的潜力。

Abstract: The natural combination of intricate topological structures and rich textual
information in text-attributed graphs (TAGs) opens up a novel perspective for
graph anomaly detection (GAD). However, existing GAD methods primarily focus on
designing complex optimization objectives within the graph domain, overlooking
the complementary value of the textual modality, whose features are often
encoded by shallow embedding techniques, such as bag-of-words or skip-gram, so
that semantic context related to anomalies may be missed. To unleash the
enormous potential of textual modality, large language models (LLMs) have
emerged as promising alternatives due to their strong semantic understanding
and reasoning capabilities. Nevertheless, their application to TAG anomaly
detection remains nascent, and they struggle to encode high-order structural
information inherent in graphs due to input length constraints. For
high-quality anomaly detection in TAGs, we propose CoLL, a novel framework that
combines LLMs and graph neural networks (GNNs) to leverage their complementary
strengths. CoLL employs multi-LLM collaboration for evidence-augmented
generation to capture anomaly-relevant contexts while delivering human-readable
rationales for detected anomalies. Moreover, CoLL integrates a GNN equipped
with a gating mechanism to adaptively fuse textual features with evidence while
preserving high-order topological information. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the superiority of CoLL, achieving an average improvement of 13.37%
in AP. This study opens a new avenue for incorporating LLMs in advancing GAD.

Conclusion: CMUCL通过整合文本和图拓扑信息，显著提升了异常检测性能，并发布了8个数据集以推动未来研究。

Abstract: The widespread application of graph data in various high-risk scenarios has
increased attention to graph anomaly detection (GAD). Faced with real-world
graphs that often carry node descriptions in the form of raw text sequences,
termed text-attributed graphs (TAGs), existing graph anomaly detection
pipelines typically involve shallow embedding techniques to encode such textual
information into features, and then rely on complex self-supervised tasks
within the graph domain to detect anomalies. However, this text encoding
process is separated from the anomaly detection training objective in the graph
domain, making it difficult to ensure that the extracted textual features focus
on GAD-relevant information, seriously constraining the detection capability.
How to seamlessly integrate raw text and graph topology to unleash the vast
potential of cross-modal data in TAGs for anomaly detection poses a challenging
issue. This paper presents a novel end-to-end paradigm for text-attributed
graph anomaly detection, named CMUCL. We simultaneously model data from both
text and graph structures, and jointly train text and graph encoders by
leveraging cross-modal and uni-modal multi-scale consistency to uncover
potential anomaly-related information. Accordingly, we design an anomaly score
estimator based on inconsistency mining to derive node-specific anomaly scores.
Considering the lack of benchmark datasets tailored for anomaly detection on
TAGs, we release 8 datasets to facilitate future research. Extensive
evaluations show that CMUCL significantly advances in text-attributed graph
anomaly detection, delivering an 11.13% increase in average accuracy (AP) over
the suboptimal.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法对不规则延迟敏感且未分离延迟与带反馈的效应，需改进。

Method: 提出DBGD-NF算法和改进版，分别利用平均延迟和分块更新机制。

Result: DBGD-NF达到O(n¯d^{1/3}T^{2/3})遗憾界，改进版为O(n(T^{2/3} + √(dT)))。

Conclusion: 新算法在延迟反馈下表现更优，实验验证了其有效性。

Abstract: We investigate the online nonsubmodular optimization with delayed feedback in
the bandit setting, where the loss function is $\alpha$-weakly DR-submodular
and $\beta$-weakly DR-supermodular. Previous work has established an
$(\alpha,\beta)$-regret bound of $\mathcal{O}(nd^{1/3}T^{2/3})$, where $n$ is
the dimensionality and $d$ is the maximum delay. However, its regret bound
relies on the maximum delay and is thus sensitive to irregular delays.
Additionally, it couples the effects of delays and bandit feedback as its bound
is the product of the delay term and the $\mathcal{O}(nT^{2/3})$ regret bound
in the bandit setting without delayed feedback. In this paper, we develop two
algorithms to address these limitations, respectively. Firstly, we propose a
novel method, namely DBGD-NF, which employs the one-point gradient estimator
and utilizes all the available estimated gradients in each round to update the
decision. It achieves a better $\mathcal{O}(n\bar{d}^{1/3}T^{2/3})$ regret
bound, which is relevant to the average delay $\bar{d} =
\frac{1}{T}\sum_{t=1}^T d_t\leq d$. Secondly, we extend DBGD-NF by employing a
blocking update mechanism to decouple the joint effect of the delays and bandit
feedback, which enjoys an $\mathcal{O}(n(T^{2/3} + \sqrt{dT}))$ regret bound.
When $d = \mathcal{O}(T^{1/3})$, our regret bound matches the
$\mathcal{O}(nT^{2/3})$ bound in the bandit setting without delayed feedback.
Compared to our first $\mathcal{O}(n\bar{d}^{1/3}T^{2/3})$ bound, it is more
advantageous when the maximum delay $d = o(\bar{d}^{2/3}T^{1/3})$. Finally, we
conduct experiments on structured sparse learning to demonstrate the
superiority of our methods.

Conclusion: 该两阶段策略为地质高光谱应用提供了一种实用且可重复的解决方案。

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging offers detailed spectral information for mineral
mapping; however, weak mineral signatures are often masked by noisy and
redundant bands, limiting detection performance. To address this, we propose a
two-stage integrated framework for enhanced mineral detection in the Cuprite
mining district. In the first stage, we compute the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)
for each spectral band and apply a phase-locked thresholding technique to
discard low-SNR bands, effectively removing redundancy and suppressing
background noise. Savitzky-Golay filtering is then employed for spectral
smoothing, serving a dual role first to stabilize trends during band selection,
and second to preserve fine-grained spectral features during preprocessing. In
the second stage, the refined HSI data is reintroduced into the model, where
KMeans clustering is used to extract 12 endmember spectra (W1 custom), followed
by non negative least squares (NNLS) for abundance unmixing. The resulting
endmembers are quantitatively compared with laboratory spectra (W1 raw) using
cosine similarity and RMSE metrics. Experimental results confirm that our
proposed pipeline improves unmixing accuracy and enhances the detection of weak
mineral zones. This two-pass strategy demonstrates a practical and reproducible
solution for spectral dimensionality reduction and unmixing in geological HSI
applications.

Abstract: We argue that existing definitions of interpretability are not actionable in
that they fail to inform users about general, sound, and robust interpretable

interpretable AI community. We show that our definition is actionable, as it
directly reveals the foundational properties, underlying assumptions,
principles, data structures, and architectural features necessary for designing
interpretable models. Building on this, we propose a general blueprint for
designing interpretable models and introduce the first open-sourced library
with native support for interpretable data structures and processes.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种利用机器学习势能面（PES）模拟氢原子转移（HAT）反应的方法，通过生成大量肽段HAT配置数据，并比较三种图神经网络架构的性能，最终MACE模型表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HAT反应在生物过程中至关重要，但其机制尚不完全清楚，传统模拟方法无法满足量子化学精度需求。

Method: 系统生成肽段HAT配置数据集，使用半经验方法和DFT，并比较SchNet、Allegro和MACE三种图神经网络架构的性能。

Result: MACE模型在能量、力和反应势垒预测上表现最优，平均绝对误差为1.13 kcal/mol，适用于大规模胶原模拟。

Conclusion: 该方法可推广至其他生物分子系统，实现复杂环境中化学反应性的量子精确模拟。

Abstract: Hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) reactions are essential in many biological
processes, such as radical migration in damaged proteins, but their mechanistic
pathways remain incompletely understood. Simulating HAT is challenging due to
the need for quantum chemical accuracy at biologically relevant scales; thus,
neither classical force fields nor DFT-based molecular dynamics are applicable.
Machine-learned potentials offer an alternative, able to learn potential energy
surfaces (PESs) with near-quantum accuracy. However, training these models to
generalize across diverse HAT configurations, especially at radical positions
in proteins, requires tailored data generation and careful model selection.
Here, we systematically generate HAT configurations in peptides to build large
datasets using semiempirical methods and DFT. We benchmark three graph neural
network architectures (SchNet, Allegro, and MACE) on their ability to learn HAT
PESs and indirectly predict reaction barriers from energy predictions. MACE
consistently outperforms the others in energy, force, and barrier prediction,
achieving a mean absolute error of 1.13 kcal/mol on out-of-distribution DFT
barrier predictions. This accuracy enables integration of ML potentials into
large-scale collagen simulations to compute reaction rates from predicted
barriers, advancing mechanistic understanding of HAT and radical migration in
peptides. We analyze scaling laws, model transferability, and cost-performance
trade-offs, and outline strategies for improvement by combining ML potentials
with transition state search algorithms and active learning. Our approach is
generalizable to other biomolecular systems, enabling quantum-accurate
simulations of chemical reactivity in complex environments.

Motivation: 研究AL在实际应用中的局限性及其在低数据场景下的表现。

Method: 比较AL、DA和SSL在低数据场景下的效果，并探索它们的组合使用。

Result: AL单独效果有限（提升1-4%），但结合DA和SSL后仍有额外提升。

Conclusion: AL应作为DA和SSL后的补充工具，而非独立解决方案。

Abstract: Even though Active Learning (AL) is widely studied, it is rarely applied in
contexts outside its own scientific literature. We posit that the reason for
this is AL's high computational cost coupled with the comparatively small lifts
it is typically able to generate in scenarios with few labeled points. In this
work we study the impact of different methods to combat this low data scenario,
namely data augmentation (DA), semi-supervised learning (SSL) and AL. We find
that AL is by far the least efficient method of solving the low data problem,
generating a lift of only 1-4\% over random sampling, while DA and SSL methods
can generate up to 60\% lift in combination with random sampling. However, when
AL is combined with strong DA and SSL techniques, it surprisingly is still able
to provide improvements. Based on these results, we frame AL not as a method to
combat missing labels, but as the final building block to squeeze the last bits
of performance out of data after appropriate DA and SSL methods as been
applied.

Result: 在MIMIC-III数据集上，模型AUC-ROC达0.94，优于基线方法和单一GNN模型。

Conclusion: 该框架为ICU风险预测提供了可扩展且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurately predicting the criticalness of ICU patients (such as in-ICU
mortality risk) is vital for early intervention in critical care. However,
conventional models often treat each patient in isolation and struggle to
exploit the relational structure in Electronic Health Records (EHR). We propose
a Similarity-Based Self-Construct Graph Model (SBSCGM) that dynamically builds
a patient similarity graph from multi-modal EHR data, and a HybridGraphMedGNN
architecture that operates on this graph to predict patient mortality and a
continuous criticalness score. SBSCGM uses a hybrid similarity measure
(combining feature-based and structural similarities) to connect patients with
analogous clinical profiles in real-time. The HybridGraphMedGNN integrates
Graph Convolutional Network (GCN), GraphSAGE, and Graph Attention Network (GAT)
layers to learn robust patient representations, leveraging both local and
global graph patterns. In experiments on 6,000 ICU stays from the MIMIC-III
dataset, our model achieves state-of-the-art performance (AUC-ROC $0.94$)
outperforming baseline classifiers and single-type GNN models. We also
demonstrate improved precision/recall and show that the attention mechanism
provides interpretable insights into model predictions. Our framework offers a
scalable and interpretable solution for critical care risk prediction, with
potential to support clinicians in real-world ICU deployment.

Conclusion: IAMAP通过简化深度学习流程，推动了遥感领域中高效和节能方法的普及。

Abstract: Remote sensing has entered a new era with the rapid development of artificial
intelligence approaches. However, the implementation of deep learning has
largely remained restricted to specialists and has been impractical because it
often requires (i) large reference datasets for model training and validation;
(ii) substantial computing resources; and (iii) strong coding skills. Here, we
introduce IAMAP, a user-friendly QGIS plugin that addresses these three
challenges in an easy yet flexible way. IAMAP builds on recent advancements in
self-supervised learning strategies, which now provide robust feature
extractors, often referred to as foundation models. These generalist models can
often be reliably used in few-shot or zero-shot scenarios (i.e., with little to
no fine-tuning). IAMAP's interface allows users to streamline several key steps
in remote sensing image analysis: (i) extracting image features using a wide
range of deep learning architectures; (ii) reducing dimensionality with
built-in algorithms; (iii) performing clustering on features or their reduced
representations; (iv) generating feature similarity maps; and (v) calibrating
and validating supervised machine learning models for prediction. By enabling
non-AI specialists to leverage the high-quality features provided by recent
deep learning approaches without requiring GPU capacity or extensive reference
datasets, IAMAP contributes to the democratization of computationally efficient
and energy-conscious deep learning methods.

*Xiong Xiong,Zhuo Zhang,Rongchun Hu,Chen Gao,Zichen Deng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SV-SNN是一种新型神经网络框架，通过分离变量和自适应谱方法解决高频振荡PDE求解中的谱偏差问题，显著提升精度并减少参数和训练时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统PINN存在谱偏差问题，难以捕捉高频解成分，限制了其在科学计算中的应用。

Method: SV-SNN结合变量分离和自适应谱方法，包括分解多元函数为单变量乘积、自适应傅里叶谱特征和基于SVD的理论框架。

Result: 在多个基准问题上，SV-SNN精度提升1-3个数量级，参数减少90%以上，训练时间缩短60%。

Conclusion: SV-SNN有效解决了神经PDE求解中的谱偏差问题，具有显著优势。

Abstract: Solving high-frequency oscillatory partial differential equations (PDEs) is a
critical challenge in scientific computing, with applications in fluid
mechanics, quantum mechanics, and electromagnetic wave propagation. Traditional
physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) suffer from spectral bias, limiting
their ability to capture high-frequency solution components. We introduce
Separated-Variable Spectral Neural Networks (SV-SNN), a novel framework that
addresses these limitations by integrating separation of variables with
adaptive spectral methods. Our approach features three key innovations: (1)
decomposition of multivariate functions into univariate function products,
enabling independent spatial and temporal networks; (2) adaptive Fourier
spectral features with learnable frequency parameters for high-frequency
capture; and (3) theoretical framework based on singular value decomposition to
quantify spectral bias. Comprehensive evaluation on benchmark problems
including Heat equation, Helmholtz equation, Poisson equations and
Navier-Stokes equations demonstrates that SV-SNN achieves 1-3 orders of
magnitude improvement in accuracy while reducing parameter count by over 90\%
and training time by 60\%. These results establish SV-SNN as an effective
solution to the spectral bias problem in neural PDE solving. The implementation
will be made publicly available upon acceptance at

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于KAN的自适应频率选择学习架构（KFS），用于解决时间序列预测中多尺度噪声干扰和频率信息分布不均的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界的时间序列在不同尺度上存在噪声干扰，且频率信息分布不均，导致多尺度表示效果不佳。

Method: 结合Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks（KAN）和Parseval定理，设计了KFS架构，包括FreK模块（基于能量分布选择主导频率）、时间戳嵌入对齐和特征混合模块。

Result: 在多个真实时间序列数据集上，KFS表现出最先进的性能。

Conclusion: KFS是一种简单而有效的架构，能够显著提升时间序列预测的准确性。

Abstract: Multi-scale decomposition architectures have emerged as predominant
methodologies in time series forecasting. However, real-world time series
exhibit noise interference across different scales, while heterogeneous
information distribution among frequency components at varying scales leads to
suboptimal multi-scale representation. Inspired by Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks
(KAN) and Parseval's theorem, we propose a KAN based adaptive Frequency
Selection learning architecture (KFS) to address these challenges. This
framework tackles prediction challenges stemming from cross-scale noise
interference and complex pattern modeling through its FreK module, which
performs energy-distribution-based dominant frequency selection in the spectral
domain. Simultaneously, KAN enables sophisticated pattern representation while
timestamp embedding alignment synchronizes temporal representations across
scales. The feature mixing module then fuses scale-specific patterns with
aligned temporal features. Extensive experiments across multiple real-world
time series datasets demonstrate that KT achieves state-of-the-art performance
as a simple yet effective architecture.

Motivation: 低成本自杀式无人机群的威胁日益增长，需要快速且战略性的决策来优化拦截优先级，现代防御系统面临严峻挑战。

Method: 提出一种高保真模拟环境，训练强化学习代理在离散动作空间中协调多效应器，基于状态特征（如位置、类别和效应器状态）选择拦截目标。

Result: 强化学习策略在数百次模拟攻击场景中表现优于手工规则基方法，平均损害更低，防御效率更高。

Conclusion: 强化学习可作为防御架构的战略层，提升韧性而不取代现有控制系统，代码和模拟资源已公开以促进复现。

Abstract: The growing threat of low-cost kamikaze drone swarms poses a critical
challenge to modern defense systems demanding rapid and strategic
decision-making to prioritize interceptions across multiple effectors and
high-value target zones. In this work, we present a case study demonstrating
the practical advantages of reinforcement learning in addressing this
challenge. We introduce a high-fidelity simulation environment that captures
realistic operational constraints, within which a decision-level reinforcement
learning agent learns to coordinate multiple effectors for optimal interception
prioritization. Operating in a discrete action space, the agent selects which
drone to engage per effector based on observed state features such as
positions, classes, and effector status. We evaluate the learned policy against
a handcrafted rule-based baseline across hundreds of simulated attack
scenarios. The reinforcement learning based policy consistently achieves lower
average damage and higher defensive efficiency in protecting critical zones.
This case study highlights the potential of reinforcement learning as a
strategic layer within defense architectures, enhancing resilience without
displacing existing control systems. All code and simulation assets are
publicly released for full reproducibility, and a video demonstration
illustrates the policy's qualitative behavior.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FNO存在过参数化和缺乏不确定性量化的问题，限制了其在科学和工程应用中的可靠性。

Method: DINOZAUR采用扩散乘子替代FNO中的密集张量乘子，减少参数数量，并通过贝叶斯方法实现不确定性量化。

Result: 在多个PDE基准测试中表现优异，同时提供高效的不确定性量化。

Conclusion: DINOZAUR在保持性能的同时解决了FNO的可扩展性和不确定性量化问题。

Abstract: Operator learning is a powerful paradigm for solving partial differential
equations, with Fourier Neural Operators serving as a widely adopted
foundation. However, FNOs face significant scalability challenges due to
overparameterization and offer no native uncertainty quantification -- a key
requirement for reliable scientific and engineering applications. Instead,
neural operators rely on post hoc UQ methods that ignore geometric inductive
biases. In this work, we introduce DINOZAUR: a diffusion-based neural operator
parametrization with uncertainty quantification. Inspired by the structure of
the heat kernel, DINOZAUR replaces the dense tensor multiplier in FNOs with a
dimensionality-independent diffusion multiplier that has a single learnable
time parameter per channel, drastically reducing parameter count and memory
footprint without compromising predictive performance. By defining priors over
those time parameters, we cast DINOZAUR as a Bayesian neural operator to yield
spatially correlated outputs and calibrated uncertainty estimates. Our method
achieves competitive or superior performance across several PDE benchmarks
while providing efficient uncertainty quantification.

Motivation: 解决纵向EHR数据中不规则采样和临床进展与生存结果透明关联的挑战。

Method: 使用NCDE提取连续潜在轨迹，通过时间感知对比学习对齐潜在状态空间，并采用两阶段解释方法（向量场和聚类）关联临床进展与生存结果。

Result: 在MIMIC-III和eICU数据集上表现出优于现有深度学习方法的高准确性和透明性。

Conclusion: TrajSurv为临床决策提供了可信赖的生存预测工具，兼具准确性和可解释性。

Abstract: Trustworthy survival prediction is essential for clinical decision making.
Longitudinal electronic health records (EHRs) provide a uniquely powerful
opportunity for the prediction. However, it is challenging to accurately model
the continuous clinical progression of patients underlying the irregularly
sampled clinical features and to transparently link the progression to survival
outcomes. To address these challenges, we develop TrajSurv, a model that learns
continuous latent trajectories from longitudinal EHR data for trustworthy
survival prediction. TrajSurv employs a neural controlled differential equation
(NCDE) to extract continuous-time latent states from the irregularly sampled
data, forming continuous latent trajectories. To ensure the latent trajectories
reflect the clinical progression, TrajSurv aligns the latent state space with
patient state space through a time-aware contrastive learning approach. To
transparently link clinical progression to the survival outcome, TrajSurv uses
latent trajectories in a two-step divide-and-conquer interpretation process.
First, it explains how the changes in clinical features translate into the
latent trajectory's evolution using a learned vector field. Second, it clusters
these latent trajectories to identify key clinical progression patterns
associated with different survival outcomes. Evaluations on two real-world
medical datasets, MIMIC-III and eICU, show TrajSurv's competitive accuracy and
superior transparency over existing deep learning methods.

TL;DR: 提出了一种动态原型（DP）的动态图异常检测（DGAD）模型，用于捕捉跨域和域内演化的异常模式，并在多个真实数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有通用图异常检测模型在静态图上表现良好，但在动态图上难以捕捉演化异常，且新领域缺乏标注数据，需要同时捕捉域特定和域无关的异常模式。

Method: DP-DGAD通过动态原型提取演化的正常和异常模式表示，选择性更新内存缓冲区，并使用异常评分器和置信度伪标记进行自监督适应。

Result: 在十个不同领域的真实数据集上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: DP-DGAD能有效捕捉动态图中的演化异常模式，适用于跨域场景。

Abstract: Dynamic graph anomaly detection (DGAD) is essential for identifying anomalies
in evolving graphs across domains such as finance, traffic, and social
networks. Recently, generalist graph anomaly detection (GAD) models have shown
promising results. They are pretrained on multiple source datasets and
generalize across domains. While effective on static graphs, they struggle to
capture evolving anomalies in dynamic graphs. Moreover, the continuous
emergence of new domains and the lack of labeled data further challenge
generalist DGAD. Effective cross-domain DGAD requires both domain-specific and
domain-agnostic anomalous patterns. Importantly, these patterns evolve
temporally within and across domains. Building on these insights, we propose a
DGAD model with Dynamic Prototypes (DP) to capture evolving domain-specific and
domain-agnostic patterns. Firstly, DP-DGAD extracts dynamic prototypes, i.e.,
evolving representations of normal and anomalous patterns, from temporal
ego-graphs and stores them in a memory buffer. The buffer is selectively
updated to retain general, domain-agnostic patterns while incorporating new
domain-specific ones. Then, an anomaly scorer compares incoming data with
dynamic prototypes to flag both general and domain-specific anomalies. Finally,
DP-DGAD employs confidence-based pseudo-labeling for effective self-supervised
adaptation in target domains. Extensive experiments demonstrate
state-of-the-art performance across ten real-world datasets from different
domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如GDFM和GAN）在合成风电功率场景时各有局限性：GDFM能提取空间相关性但无法精确模拟波形，而GAN能生成时间相关性但缺乏动态因子。结合两者优势可提升场景合成的准确性。

Method: 通过GAN提取具有时间信息的动态因子滤波器，并将其应用于GDFM中，以同时捕捉空间和频率相关性。

Result: 在澳大利亚风电数据上的测试表明，该方法在合成风电功率场景时优于单独使用GDFM或GAN，能更好地模拟实际风电的统计特性。

Conclusion: 结合GDFM和GAN的方法显著提升了风电功率场景合成的性能，为资源充足性研究提供了更可靠的输入。

Abstract: For conducting resource adequacy studies, we synthesize multiple long-term
wind power scenarios of distributed wind farms simultaneously by using the
spatio-temporal features: spatial and temporal correlation, waveforms, marginal
and ramp rates distributions of waveform, power spectral densities, and
statistical characteristics. Generating the spatial correlation in scenarios
requires the design of common factors for neighboring wind farms and
antithetical factors for distant wind farms. The generalized dynamic factor
model (GDFM) can extract the common factors through cross spectral density
analysis, but it cannot closely imitate waveforms. The GAN can synthesize
plausible samples representing the temporal correlation by verifying samples
through a fake sample discriminator. To combine the advantages of GDFM and GAN,
we use the GAN to provide a filter that extracts dynamic factors with temporal
information from the observation data, and we then apply this filter in the
GDFM to represent both spatial and frequency correlations of plausible
waveforms. Numerical tests on the combination of GDFM and GAN have demonstrated
performance improvements over competing alternatives in synthesizing wind power
scenarios from Australia, better realizing plausible statistical
characteristics of actual wind power compared to alternatives such as the GDFM
with a filter synthesized from distributions of actual dynamic filters and the
GAN with direct synthesis without dynamic factors.

Abstract: The classification of clinical notes into specific diagnostic categories is
critical in healthcare, especially for mental health conditions like Anxiety
and Adjustment Disorder. In this study, we compare the performance of various
Artificial Intelligence models, including both traditional Machine Learning
approaches (Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, K-nearest neighbors,
Decision Tree, and eXtreme Gradient Boost) and Deep Learning models (DistilBERT
and SciBERT), to classify clinical notes into these two diagnoses.
Additionally, we implemented three oversampling strategies: No Oversampling,
Random Oversampling, and Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE), to
assess their impact on model performance. Hyperparameter tuning was also
applied to optimize model accuracy. Our results indicate that oversampling
techniques had minimal impact on model performance overall. The only exception
was SMOTE, which showed a positive effect specifically with BERT-based models.
However, hyperparameter optimization significantly improved accuracy across the
models, enhancing their ability to generalize and perform on the dataset. The
Decision Tree and eXtreme Gradient Boost models achieved the highest accuracy
among machine learning approaches, both reaching 96%, while the DistilBERT and
SciBERT models also attained 96% accuracy in the deep learning category. These
findings underscore the importance of hyperparameter tuning in maximizing model
performance. This study contributes to the ongoing research on AI-assisted
diagnostic tools in mental health by providing insights into the efficacy of
different model architectures and data balancing methods.

Result: MIND在大型真实网络上表现优异，优于现有网络拆解方法。

Conclusion: MIND的高效性和泛化能力可扩展至其他复杂网络问题。

Abstract: The application of message-passing Graph Neural Networks has been a
breakthrough for important network science problems. However, the competitive
performance often relies on using handcrafted structural features as inputs,
which increases computational cost and introduces bias into the otherwise
purely data-driven network representations. Here, we eliminate the need for
handcrafted features by introducing an attention mechanism and utilizing
message-iteration profiles, in addition to an effective algorithmic approach to
generate a structurally diverse training set of small synthetic networks.
Thereby, we build an expressive message-passing framework and use it to
efficiently solve the NP-hard problem of Network Dismantling, virtually
equivalent to vital node identification, with significant real-world
applications. Trained solely on diversified synthetic networks, our proposed
model -- MIND: Message Iteration Network Dismantler -- generalizes to large,
unseen real networks with millions of nodes, outperforming state-of-the-art
network dismantling methods. Increased efficiency and generalizability of the
proposed model can be leveraged beyond dismantling in a range of complex
network problems.

Motivation: r-MDPs通过显式建模转移动态的不确定性，合成具有性能保证的稳健策略，但传统方法需要大量样本交互。

Method: 利用状态空间分解表示，将非凸优化问题转化为线性规划，并直接从数据中学习分解模型。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在样本效率和策略性能上优于现有方法，提供更紧的性能保证。

Conclusion: 分解结构能显著提升r-MDPs的学习效率和策略稳健性。

Abstract: Robust Markov decision processes (r-MDPs) extend MDPs by explicitly modelling
epistemic uncertainty about transition dynamics. Learning r-MDPs from
interactions with an unknown environment enables the synthesis of robust
policies with provable (PAC) guarantees on performance, but this can require a
large number of sample interactions. We propose novel methods for solving and
learning r-MDPs based on factored state-space representations that leverage the
independence between model uncertainty across system components. Although
policy synthesis for factored r-MDPs leads to hard, non-convex optimisation
problems, we show how to reformulate these into tractable linear programs.
Building on these, we also propose methods to learn factored model
representations directly. Our experimental results show that exploiting
factored structure can yield dimensional gains in sample efficiency, producing
more effective robust policies with tighter performance guarantees than
state-of-the-art methods.

Result: 在多数任务中优于基线方法，且样本效率高；自动特征提取显著提升低效任务准确率。

Conclusion: JSON-Bag模型能有效表示游戏轨迹，且JSD距离与策略距离高度相关。

Abstract: We introduce JSON Bag-of-Tokens model (JSON-Bag) as a method to generically
represent game trajectories by tokenizing their JSON descriptions and apply
Jensen-Shannon distance (JSD) as distance metric for them. Using a
prototype-based nearest-neighbor search (P-NNS), we evaluate the validity of
JSON-Bag with JSD on six tabletop games -- \textit{7 Wonders},
\textit{Dominion}, \textit{Sea Salt and Paper}, \textit{Can't Stop},
\textit{Connect4}, \textit{Dots and boxes} -- each over three game trajectory
classification tasks: classifying the playing agents, game parameters, or game
seeds that were used to generate the trajectories.
  Our approach outperforms a baseline using hand-crafted features in the
majority of tasks. Evaluating on N-shot classification suggests using JSON-Bag
prototype to represent game trajectory classes is also sample efficient.
Additionally, we demonstrate JSON-Bag ability for automatic feature extraction
by treating tokens as individual features to be used in Random Forest to solve
the tasks above, which significantly improves accuracy on underperforming
tasks. Finally, we show that, across all six games, the JSD between JSON-Bag
prototypes of agent classes highly correlates with the distances between
agents' policies.

Motivation: 现有图域适应方法假设源标签干净，但实际中标签噪声普遍存在，影响性能。

Result: 在基准数据集上，NeGPR 在严重标签噪声下优于现有方法，准确率提升高达12.7%。

Conclusion: NeGPR 有效解决了标签噪声对图域适应的负面影响，提升了跨域学习的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Graph Domain Adaptation (GDA) facilitates knowledge transfer from labeled
source graphs to unlabeled target graphs by learning domain-invariant
representations, which is essential in applications such as molecular property
prediction and social network analysis. However, most existing GDA methods rely
on the assumption of clean source labels, which rarely holds in real-world
scenarios where annotation noise is pervasive. This label noise severely
impairs feature alignment and degrades adaptation performance under domain
shifts. To address this challenge, we propose Nested Graph Pseudo-Label
Refinement (NeGPR), a novel framework tailored for graph-level domain
adaptation with noisy labels. NeGPR first pretrains dual branches, i.e.,
semantic and topology branches, by enforcing neighborhood consistency in the
feature space, thereby reducing the influence of noisy supervision. To bridge
domain gaps, NeGPR employs a nested refinement mechanism in which one branch
selects high-confidence target samples to guide the adaptation of the other,
enabling progressive cross-domain learning. Furthermore, since pseudo-labels
may still contain noise and the pre-trained branches are already overfitted to
the noisy labels in the source domain, NeGPR incorporates a noise-aware
regularization strategy. This regularization is theoretically proven to
mitigate the adverse effects of pseudo-label noise, even under the presence of
source overfitting, thus enhancing the robustness of the adaptation process.
Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that NeGPR consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art methods under severe label noise, achieving gains
of up to 12.7% in accuracy.

Conclusion: 该方法在保证精度的同时显著降低了计算需求，适用于复杂系统的失效概率分析。

Abstract: Existing variance reduction techniques used in stochastic simulations for
rare event analysis still require a substantial number of model evaluations to
estimate small failure probabilities. In the context of complex, nonlinear
finite element modeling environments, this can become computationally
challenging-particularly for systems subjected to stochastic excitation. To
address this challenge, a multi-fidelity stratified sampling scheme with
adaptive machine learning metamodels is introduced for efficiently propagating
uncertainties and estimating small failure probabilities. In this approach, a
high-fidelity dataset generated through stratified sampling is used to train a
deep learning-based metamodel, which then serves as a cost-effective and highly
correlated low-fidelity model. An adaptive training scheme is proposed to
balance the trade-off between approximation quality and computational demand
associated with the development of the low-fidelity model. By integrating the
low-fidelity outputs with additional high-fidelity results, an unbiased
estimate of the strata-wise failure probabilities is obtained using a
multi-fidelity Monte Carlo framework. The overall probability of failure is
then computed using the total probability theorem. Application to a full-scale
high-rise steel building subjected to stochastic wind excitation demonstrates
that the proposed scheme can accurately estimate exceedance probability curves
for nonlinear responses of interest, while achieving significant computational
savings compared to single-fidelity variance reduction approaches.

Abstract: Bayesian neural networks and deep ensemble methods have been proposed for
uncertainty quantification; however, they are computationally intensive and
require large storage. By utilizing a single deterministic model, we can solve
the above issue. We propose an effective method based on feature space density
to quantify uncertainty for distributional shifts and out-of-distribution (OOD)
detection. Specifically, we leverage the information potential field derived
from kernel density estimation to approximate the feature space density of the
training set. By comparing this density with the feature space representation
of test samples, we can effectively determine whether a distributional shift
has occurred. Experiments were conducted on a 2D synthetic dataset (Two Moons
and Three Spirals) as well as an OOD detection task (CIFAR-10 vs. SVHN). The
results demonstrate that our method outperforms baseline models.

Abstract: Anomaly detection in tabular data remains challenging due to complex feature
interactions and the scarcity of anomalous examples. Denoising autoencoders
rely on fixed-magnitude noise, limiting adaptability to diverse data
distributions. Diffusion models introduce scheduled noise and iterative
denoising, but lack explicit reconstruction mappings. We propose the
Diffusion-Scheduled Denoising Autoencoder (DDAE), a framework that integrates
diffusion-based noise scheduling and contrastive learning into the encoding
process to improve anomaly detection. We evaluated DDAE on 57 datasets from
ADBench. Our method outperforms in semi-supervised settings and achieves
competitive results in unsupervised settings, improving PR-AUC by up to 65%
(9%) and ROC-AUC by 16% (6%) over state-of-the-art autoencoder (diffusion)
model baselines. We observed that higher noise levels benefit unsupervised
training, while lower noise with linear scheduling is optimal in
semi-supervised settings. These findings underscore the importance of
principled noise strategies in tabular anomaly detection.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Quantum Computing and Machine Learning have increased
attention to Quantum Machine Learning (QML), which aims to develop machine
learning models by exploiting the quantum computing paradigm. One of the widely
used models in this area is the Variational Quantum Circuit (VQC), a hybrid
model where the quantum circuit handles data inference while classical
optimization adjusts the parameters of the circuit. The quantum circuit
consists of an encoding layer, which loads data into the circuit, and a
template circuit, known as the ansatz, responsible for processing the data.
This work involves performing an analysis by considering both Amplitude- and
Angle-encoding models, and examining how the type of rotational gate applied
affects the classification performance of the model. This comparison is carried
out by training the different models on two datasets, Wine and Diabetes, and
evaluating their performance. The study demonstrates that, under identical
model topologies, the difference in accuracy between the best and worst models
ranges from 10% to 30%, with differences reaching up to 41%. Moreover, the
results highlight how the choice of rotational gates used in encoding can
significantly impact the model's classification performance. The findings
confirm that the embedding represents a hyperparameter for VQC models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型训练中的重计算会引入高达30%的开销，Adacc旨在通过优化内存管理减少这一开销。

Method: Adacc包含三个模块：层特定压缩算法、基于MILP的最优调度策略和自适应策略演化机制。

Result: 实验表明，Adacc能加速训练1.01x至1.37x，同时保持与基线相当的模型精度。

Conclusion: Adacc通过自适应压缩和策略优化有效提升了训练效率，且不影响模型准确性。

Abstract: Training large language models often employs recomputation to alleviate
memory pressure, which can introduce up to 30% overhead in real-world
scenarios. In this paper, we propose Adacc, a novel memory management framework
that combines adaptive compression and activation checkpointing to reduce the
GPU memory footprint. It comprises three modules: (1) We design layer-specific
compression algorithms that account for outliers in LLM tensors, instead of
directly quantizing floats from FP16 to INT4, to ensure model accuracy. (2) We
propose an optimal scheduling policy that employs MILP to determine the best
memory optimization for each tensor. (3) To accommodate changes in training
tensors, we introduce an adaptive policy evolution mechanism that adjusts the
policy during training to enhance throughput. Experimental results show that
Adacc can accelerate the LLM training by 1.01x to 1.37x compared to
state-of-the-art frameworks, while maintaining comparable model accuracy to the
Baseline.
