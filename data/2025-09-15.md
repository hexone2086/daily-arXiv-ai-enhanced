*Jiayi Miao,Dingxin Lu,Zhuqi Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 基于多模态检索增强生成的灾后房屋损坏评估框架，通过双分支编码器结构实现图像与文本语义对齐，在损坏程度分类和检索准确率方面取得显著改进


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在自然灾害后，准确评估房屋损坏对于保险赔付响应和资源规划至关重要，需要一种能够合理利用多模态信息的自动化评估方法

Method: 提出新的多模态检索增强生成(MM-RAG)框架，构建双分支多模态编码器结构：图像分支使用ResNet和Transformer编码器提取灾后建筑损坏特征，文本分支使用BERT检索器进行文本向量化和恢复指数构建。集成跨模态交互模块通过多头注意力实现语义对齐，使用模态注意力闸机制动态控制生成过程中视觉证据和文本先验信息的作用

Result: 在检索准确率和损坏程度分类指标上表现优异，Top-1检索准确率提高9.6%

Conclusion: 该多模态RAG框架通过协同学习实现了图像理解和政策匹配，为灾后房屋损坏评估提供了高效准确的解决方案

Abstract: After natural disasters, accurate evaluations of damage to housing are
important for insurance claims response and planning of resources. In this
work, we introduce a novel multimodal retrieval-augmented generation (MM-RAG)
framework. On top of classical RAG architecture, we further the framework to
devise a two-branch multimodal encoder structure that the image branch employs
a visual encoder composed of ResNet and Transformer to extract the
characteristic of building damage after disaster, and the text branch harnesses
a BERT retriever for the text vectorization of posts as well as insurance
policies and for the construction of a retrievable restoration index. To impose
cross-modal semantic alignment, the model integrates a cross-modal interaction
module to bridge the semantic representation between image and text via
multi-head attention. Meanwhile, in the generation module, the introduced modal
attention gating mechanism dynamically controls the role of visual evidence and
text prior information during generation. The entire framework takes end-to-end
training, and combines the comparison loss, the retrieval loss and the
generation loss to form multi-task optimization objectives, and achieves image
understanding and policy matching in collaborative learning. The results
demonstrate superior performance in retrieval accuracy and classification index
on damage severity, where the Top-1 retrieval accuracy has been improved by
9.6%.

### [3] [Improving MLLM Historical Record Extraction with Test-Time Image](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09722)
*Taylor Archibald,Tony Martinez*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 一种通过多重增广和对齐融合的方法，提高噪声历史文档文本提取准确性的简单可扩展框架


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决噪声历史文档中使用LLM进行文本提取时的稳定性问题

Method: 使用Gemini 2.0 Flash对每张图片生成多个增广变体，然后通过自定义的Needleman Wunsch对齐器融合输出，产生共识转写和信心度分数

Result: 在622份庞法尼亚死亡记录的新数据集上，该方法相比单次基准提高了4%的转写准确性，填充和模糊增广效果最佳

Conclusion: 该方法简单、可扩展且立即可部署到其他文档集和转写模型

Abstract: We present a novel ensemble framework that stabilizes LLM based text
extraction from noisy historical documents. We transcribe multiple augmented
variants of each image with Gemini 2.0 Flash and fuse these outputs with a
custom Needleman Wunsch style aligner that yields both a consensus
transcription and a confidence score. We present a new dataset of 622
Pennsylvania death records, and demonstrate our method improves transcription
accuracy by 4 percentage points relative to a single shot baseline. We find
that padding and blurring are the most useful for improving accuracy, while
grid warp perturbations are best for separating high and low confidence cases.
The approach is simple, scalable, and immediately deployable to other document
collections and transcription models.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了首个专门用于智能交通监控领域的大规模多模态数据集MITS，包含17万张实际监控图片和500万条问答对，通过细调主流LMM模型在ITS任务上实现了显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前通用大型多模态模型在智能交通监控领域表现有限，主要因为缺乏专门的多模态数据集。

Method: 构建MITS数据集：收集170,400张实际监控图片，进行八个主类和24个子类的标注，通过系统化管道生成500万条高质量的图片描述和问答对，覆盖五项关键ITS任务。

Result: 细调后的LMM模型在ITS应用中表现显著提升：LLaVA-1.5从0.494提升到0.905(+83.2%)，LLaVA-1.6从0.678到0.921(+35.8%)，Qwen2-VL从0.584到0.926(+58.6%)，Qwen2.5-VL从0.732到0.930(+27.0%)。

Conclusion: MITS数据集有效解决了ITS领域多模态数据缺乏问题，显著提升了LMM模型在交通监控任务上的性能，为进一步研究提供了高价值资源。

Abstract: General-domain large multimodal models (LMMs) have achieved significant
advances in various image-text tasks. However, their performance in the
Intelligent Traffic Surveillance (ITS) domain remains limited due to the
absence of dedicated multimodal datasets. To address this gap, we introduce
MITS (Multimodal Intelligent Traffic Surveillance), the first large-scale
multimodal benchmark dataset specifically designed for ITS. MITS includes
170,400 independently collected real-world ITS images sourced from traffic
surveillance cameras, annotated with eight main categories and 24 subcategories
of ITS-specific objects and events under diverse environmental conditions.
Additionally, through a systematic data generation pipeline, we generate
high-quality image captions and 5 million instruction-following visual
question-answer pairs, addressing five critical ITS tasks: object and event
recognition, object counting, object localization, background analysis, and
event reasoning. To demonstrate MITS's effectiveness, we fine-tune mainstream
LMMs on this dataset, enabling the development of ITS-specific applications.
Experimental results show that MITS significantly improves LMM performance in
ITS applications, increasing LLaVA-1.5's performance from 0.494 to 0.905
(+83.2%), LLaVA-1.6's from 0.678 to 0.921 (+35.8%), Qwen2-VL's from 0.584 to
0.926 (+58.6%), and Qwen2.5-VL's from 0.732 to 0.930 (+27.0%). We release the
dataset, code, and models as open-source, providing high-value resources to
advance both ITS and LMM research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 树状推理方法在视觉语言模型的细粒度分类任务中表现不如标准零样本提示，尽管能实现98.2%的树知识理解准确率，但结构化推理在视觉分类中存在局限性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究结构化树状推理是否能提升视觉语言模型在细粒度任务和大规模分层标签空间中的性能

Method: 引入基于决策树的框架将分类分解为可解释的决策过程，在GTSRB和CIFAR-10数据集上评估，并探索使用LLM生成的类别和图像描述来增强提示

Result: 树状推理方法持续表现不如标准零样本提示，但添加图像描述能提升树基方法和零样本方法的性能

Conclusion: 结构化推理在视觉分类中存在局限性，研究结果为设计更可解释的VLM系统提供了见解

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) excel at zero-shot visual classification, but
their performance on fine-grained tasks and large hierarchical label spaces is
understudied. This paper investigates whether structured, tree-based reasoning
can enhance VLM performance. We introduce a framework that decomposes
classification into interpretable decisions using decision trees and evaluates
it on fine-grained (GTSRB) and coarse-grained (CIFAR-10) datasets. Although the
model achieves 98.2% accuracy in understanding the tree knowledge, tree-based
reasoning consistently underperforms standard zero-shot prompting. We also
explore enhancing the tree prompts with LLM-generated classes and image
descriptions to improve alignment. The added description enhances the
performance of the tree-based and zero-shot methods. Our findings highlight
limitations of structured reasoning in visual classification and offer insights
for designing more interpretable VLM systems.

TL;DR: PSI是一个从数据中学习可控、可提示世界模型的系统，通过概率预测、结构提取和集成三个步骤的循环，不断改进模型能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 构建能够从视频数据中学习丰富控制结构和灵活提示功能的世界模型，以支持视频预测、理解和各种视觉任务的零样本推理

Method: 三步骤循环：1) 构建概率图模型Psi作为随机访问自回归序列模型；2) 通过因果推理零样本提取数据中的低维结构；3) 将结构转换为新的token类型并重新集成到训练中

Result: 在1.4万亿token的互联网视频数据上训练PSI实例，实现了最先进的光流、自监督深度和对象分割，支持完整的预测改进循环

Conclusion: PSI系统通过循环结构集成方法成功构建了可控的世界模型，能够提取有意义的中间结构并持续改进模型性能，类似于LLM的通用提示语言

Abstract: We present Probabilistic Structure Integration (PSI), a system for learning
richly controllable and flexibly promptable world models from data. PSI
consists of a three-step cycle. The first step, Probabilistic prediction,
involves building a probabilistic graphical model Psi of the data, in the form
of a random-access autoregressive sequence model. Psi supports a complete set
of learned conditional distributions describing the dependence of any variables
in the data on any other set of variables. In step 2, Structure extraction, we
show how to extract underlying low-dimensional properties in the data,
corresponding to a diverse set of meaningful "intermediate structures", in a
zero-shot fashion via causal inference on Psi. Step 3, Integration, completes
the cycle by converting these structures into new token types that are then
continually mixed back into the training diet as conditioning signals and
prediction targets. Each such cycle augments the capabilities of Psi, both
allowing it to model the underlying data better, and creating new control
handles -- akin to an LLM-like universal prompting language. We train an
instance of Psi on 1.4 trillion tokens of internet video data; we use it to
perform a variety of useful video prediction and understanding inferences; we
extract state-of-the-art optical flow, self-supervised depth and object
segmentation; and we use these structures to support a full cycle of predictive
improvements.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文首次分析联邦学习中视频数据的梯度反演攻击风险，发现特征提取器能提供更好保护，但攻击仍可能发生，图像超分辨率技术可提升攻击效果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习的隐私保护机制面临梯度反演攻击威胁，虽然图像、文本和表格数据的攻击影响已知，但视频数据在此类攻击下的脆弱性尚未研究

Method: 评估两种视频分类方法：使用预训练特征提取器的方法和处理原始视频帧的简单变换方法，测试在不同参考帧访问权限下的攻击效果

Result: 特征提取器提供更强韧性，但分类器复杂度不足时仍可能泄漏；图像超分辨率技术能显著提升重建视频质量；攻击在零参考帧、单参考帧和多参考帧场景下均有效

Conclusion: 视频数据在联邦学习中存在可行的泄漏威胁，需要进一步研究其发生条件和防护措施

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) allows multiple entities to train a shared model
collaboratively. Its core, privacy-preserving principle is that participants
only exchange model updates, such as gradients, and never their raw, sensitive
data. This approach is fundamental for applications in domains where privacy
and confidentiality are important. However, the security of this very mechanism
is threatened by gradient inversion attacks, which can reverse-engineer private
training data directly from the shared gradients, defeating the purpose of FL.
While the impact of these attacks is known for image, text, and tabular data,
their effect on video data remains an unexamined area of research. This paper
presents the first analysis of video data leakage in FL using gradient
inversion attacks. We evaluate two common video classification approaches: one
employing pre-trained feature extractors and another that processes raw video
frames with simple transformations. Our initial results indicate that the use
of feature extractors offers greater resilience against gradient inversion
attacks. We also demonstrate that image super-resolution techniques can enhance
the frames extracted through gradient inversion attacks, enabling attackers to
reconstruct higher-quality videos. Our experiments validate this across
scenarios where the attacker has access to zero, one, or more reference frames
from the target environment. We find that although feature extractors make
attacks more challenging, leakage is still possible if the classifier lacks
sufficient complexity. We, therefore, conclude that video data leakage in FL is
a viable threat, and the conditions under which it occurs warrant further
investigation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 一种用于集市环境物体检测的半监督协同训练框架，结合Faster R-CNN和YOLO优势，通过伪标签交换和集成分类提高精度，减少对手动标注的依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决集市环境中标签数据有限、遮挡严重、物体重叠等挑战，降低标注成本并适应零售业中常见的产品和布局变化。

Method: 使用Faster R-CNN(ResNet背景)进行精确定位和YOLO(Darknet背景)获取全局上下文，通过互相伪标签交换提升性能。采用XGBoost、Random Forest和SVM的集成分类器增强分类稳健性，并使用元神经算法优化超参数。

Result: 在SKU-110k数据集上表现出艰强的性能，高亮框架的可扩展性和实用性，适用于自动化库存跟踪、产品监控和结账系统等实际零售应用。

Conclusion: 该半监督协同训练框架能够有效应对集市环境的复杂挑战，显著减少对手动标注的依赖，具有良好的实际应用价值。

Abstract: This study proposes a semi-supervised co-training framework for object
detection in densely packed retail environments, where limited labeled data and
complex conditions pose major challenges. The framework combines Faster R-CNN
(utilizing a ResNet backbone) for precise localization with YOLO (employing a
Darknet backbone) for global context, enabling mutual pseudo-label exchange
that improves accuracy in scenes with occlusion and overlapping objects. To
strengthen classification, it employs an ensemble of XGBoost, Random Forest,
and SVM, utilizing diverse feature representations for higher robustness.
Hyperparameters are optimized using a metaheuristic-driven algorithm, enhancing
precision and efficiency across models. By minimizing reliance on manual
labeling, the approach reduces annotation costs and adapts effectively to
frequent product and layout changes common in retail. Experiments on the
SKU-110k dataset demonstrate strong performance, highlighting the scalability
and practicality of the proposed framework for real-world retail applications
such as automated inventory tracking, product monitoring, and checkout systems.

TL;DR: 提出Token Purging(PG)方法，一种无需反向传播的测试时自适应技术，通过移除受域偏移影响严重的token来提升3D点云分类性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决3D点云分类中因分布偏移导致的性能下降问题，现有TTA方法需要迭代更新，效率较低

Method: 提出两种变体：PG-SP利用源域统计信息，PG-SF是完全无源版本，依赖CLS-token驱动自适应。在注意力层前移除受域偏移影响的token

Result: 在ModelNet40-C、ShapeNet-C和ScanObjectNN-C上评估，PG-SP比最先进的无反向传播方法平均准确率高10.3%，PG-SF在无源自适应方面创下新基准。速度提升12.4倍，内存效率提高5.5倍

Conclusion: Token Purging是一种高效、内存友好的测试时自适应方法，适用于实际部署，无需反向传播即可实现鲁棒的性能提升

Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) is crucial for mitigating performance degradation
caused by distribution shifts in 3D point cloud classification. In this work,
we introduce Token Purging (PG), a novel backpropagation-free approach that
removes tokens highly affected by domain shifts before they reach attention
layers. Unlike existing TTA methods, PG operates at the token level, ensuring
robust adaptation without iterative updates. We propose two variants: PG-SP,
which leverages source statistics, and PG-SF, a fully source-free version
relying on CLS-token-driven adaptation. Extensive evaluations on ModelNet40-C,
ShapeNet-C, and ScanObjectNN-C demonstrate that PG-SP achieves an average of
+10.3\% higher accuracy than state-of-the-art backpropagation-free methods,
while PG-SF sets new benchmarks for source-free adaptation. Moreover, PG is
12.4 times faster and 5.5 times more memory efficient than our baseline, making
it suitable for real-world deployment. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 一种高精度可解释的细粒度跨视角定位方法，通过直接匹配地面与帆海图像的局部特征来估计相机位姿，避免传统BEV转换导致的信息损失


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法将地面图像转换为鸟视图并与帆海图对齐，但这种转换容易造成视角扭曲或高度信息压缩，影响对齐质量

Method: 直接建立地面-帆海图像对应关系，仅将匹配关键点通过单目深度优先信息提升到BEV空间，采用尺度敏感的Procrustes对齐估计相机位姿

Result: 在挑战性条件下（跨区域泛化、未知方向）达到优异的定位性能，且不需要每个深度模型的细调，兼容各种相对深度模型

Conclusion: 该方法通过避免全局BEV转换减少信息损失，实现了高精度定位，具有强法实部署潜力

Abstract: We propose an accurate and highly interpretable fine-grained cross-view
localization method that estimates the 3 Degrees of Freedom pose of a
ground-level image by matching its local features with a reference aerial
image. Previous methods typically transform the ground image into a bird's-eye
view (BEV) representation and then align it with the aerial image for
localization. However, this transformation often leads to information loss due
to perspective distortion or compression of height information, thereby
degrading alignment quality with the aerial view. In contrast, our method
directly establishes correspondences between ground and aerial images and lifts
only the matched keypoints to BEV space using monocular depth prior. Notably,
modern depth predictors can provide reliable metric depth when the test samples
are similar to the training data. When the depth distribution differs, they
still produce consistent relative depth, i.e., depth accurate up to an unknown
scale. Our method supports both metric and relative depth. It employs a
scale-aware Procrustes alignment to estimate the camera pose from the
correspondences and optionally recover the scale when using relative depth.
Experimental results demonstrate that, with only weak supervision on camera
pose, our method learns accurate local feature correspondences and achieves
superior localization performance under challenging conditions, such as
cross-area generalization and unknown orientation. Moreover, our method is
compatible with various relative depth models without requiring per-model
finetuning. This flexibility, combined with strong localization performance,
makes it well-suited for real-world deployment.

Abstract: Numerous visual impairments can be detected in red-eye reflex images from
young children. The so-called Bruckner test is traditionally performed by
ophthalmologists in clinical settings. Thanks to the recent technological
advances in smartphones and artificial intelligence, it is now possible to
recreate the Bruckner test using a mobile device. In this paper, we present a
first study conducted during the development of KidsVisionCheck, a free
application that can perform vision screening with a mobile device using
red-eye reflex images. The underlying model relies on deep neural networks
trained on children's pupil images collected and labeled by an ophthalmologist.
With an accuracy of 90% on unseen test data, our model provides highly reliable
performance without the necessity of specialist equipment. Furthermore, we can
identify the optimal conditions for data collection, which can in turn be used
to provide immediate feedback to the users. In summary, this work marks a first
step toward accessible pediatric vision screenings and early intervention for
vision abnormalities worldwide.

Motivation: 现有的传感器融合方法在处理具有挑战性的条件时性能受限，因为它们在整个输入空间范围内统一处理传感器数据，无法适应不同传感器在不同空间位置的可信度变化。

Method: 将多模态分割构建为多任务问题，利用激光雷达测量作为输入和深度学习的真值。通过辅助深度头学习深度感知特征，编码为空间变化的局部深度token，结合全局条件token动态调整传感器融合策略。

Conclusion: 深度引导的多模态融合方法能够有效适应传感器在不同深度条件下的可靠性变化，显著提升了自动驾驶语义感知的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Robust semantic perception for autonomous vehicles relies on effectively
combining multiple sensors with complementary strengths and weaknesses.
State-of-the-art sensor fusion approaches to semantic perception often treat
sensor data uniformly across the spatial extent of the input, which hinders
performance when faced with challenging conditions. By contrast, we propose a
novel depth-guided multimodal fusion method that upgrades condition-aware
fusion by integrating depth information. Our network, DGFusion, poses
multimodal segmentation as a multi-task problem, utilizing the lidar
measurements, which are typically available in outdoor sensor suites, both as
one of the model's inputs and as ground truth for learning depth. Our
corresponding auxiliary depth head helps to learn depth-aware features, which
are encoded into spatially varying local depth tokens that condition our
attentive cross-modal fusion. Together with a global condition token, these
local depth tokens dynamically adapt sensor fusion to the spatially varying
reliability of each sensor across the scene, which largely depends on depth. In
addition, we propose a robust loss for our depth, which is essential for
learning from lidar inputs that are typically sparse and noisy in adverse
conditions. Our method achieves state-of-the-art panoptic and semantic
segmentation performance on the challenging MUSES and DELIVER datasets. Code

Motivation: 酒渣鼻是一种慢性炎症性皮肤病，需要精确早期检测以提高治疗效果。传统全图像方法存在隐私泄露风险，且可能无法充分关注临床相关区域。

Method: 使用ResNet-18深度学习框架，从面部图像提取不同大小、形状和位置的各种图像补丁，研究局部视觉信息对模型性能的影响。

Abstract: Rosacea, which is a chronic inflammatory skin condition that manifests with
facial redness, papules, and visible blood vessels, often requirs precise and
early detection for significantly improving treatment effectiveness. This paper
presents new patch-based automatic rosacea detection strategies using the
ResNet-18 deep learning framework. The contributions of the proposed strategies
come from the following aspects. First, various image pateches are extracted
from the facial images of people in different sizes, shapes, and locations.
Second, a number of investigation studies are carried out to evaluate how the
localized visual information influences the deep learing model performance.
Third, thorough experiments are implemented to reveal that several patch-based
automatic rosacea detection strategies achieve competitive or superior accuracy
and sensitivity than the full-image based methods. And finally, the proposed
patch-based strategies, which use only localized patches, inherently preserve
patient privacy by excluding any identifiable facial features from the data.
The experimental results indicate that the proposed patch-based strategies
guide the deep learning model to focus on clinically relevant regions, enhance
robustness and interpretability, and protect patient privacy. As a result, the
proposed strategies offer practical insights for improving automated
dermatological diagnostics.

Abstract: Rosacea is a common but underdiagnosed inflammatory skin condition that
primarily affects the central face and presents with subtle redness, pustules,
and visible blood vessels. Automated detection remains challenging due to the
diffuse nature of symptoms, the scarcity of labeled datasets, and privacy
concerns associated with using identifiable facial images. A novel
privacy-preserving automated rosacea detection method inspired by clinical
priors and trained entirely on synthetic data is presented in this paper.
Specifically, the proposed method, which leverages the observation that rosacea
manifests predominantly through central facial erythema, first constructs a
fixed redness-informed mask by selecting regions with consistently high red
channel intensity across facial images. The mask thus is able to focus on
diagnostically relevant areas such as the cheeks, nose, and forehead and
exclude identity-revealing features. Second, the ResNet-18 deep learning
method, which is trained on the masked synthetic images, achieves superior
performance over the full-face baselines with notable gains in terms of
accuracy, recall and F1 score when evaluated using the real-world test data.
The experimental results demonstrate that the synthetic data and clinical
priors can jointly enable accurate and ethical dermatological AI systems,
especially for privacy sensitive applications in telemedicine and large-scale
screening.

Motivation: 为了严格评估ULW腹腔镜图像去烟雾框架中各个组件的有效性和必要性，需要进行全面的消融研究来确定每个组件的具体贡献

Method: 系统性地移除框架组件：1) 移除可学习维纳滤波器模块；2) 选择性使用复合损失函数中的单个损失项（MSE、SSIM损失、感知损失）。在公开的配对腹腔镜图像数据集上进行定量和定性评估

Abstract: To rigorously assess the effectiveness and necessity of individual components
within the recently proposed ULW framework for laparoscopic image desmoking,
this paper presents a comprehensive ablation study. The ULW approach combines a
U-Net based backbone with a compound loss function that comprises mean squared
error (MSE), structural similarity index (SSIM) loss, and perceptual loss. The
framework also incorporates a differentiable, learnable Wiener filter module.
In this study, each component is systematically ablated to evaluate its
specific contribution to the overall performance of the whole framework. The
analysis includes: (1) removal of the learnable Wiener filter, (2) selective
use of individual loss terms from the composite loss function. All variants are
benchmarked on a publicly available paired laparoscopic images dataset using
quantitative metrics (SSIM, PSNR, MSE and CIEDE-2000) alongside qualitative
visual comparisons.

TL;DR: WAVE-DETR是一种结合可见光RGB和声学信号的多模态无人机检测器，基于Deformable DETR和Wav2Vec2架构，在挑战性环境条件下实现强大的无人机目标检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决在复杂环境条件下无人机检测的挑战，研究者希望通过融合视觉和声学信息来提高检测的鲁棒性和准确性。

Method: 开发了四种不同的融合配置（门控机制、线性层、MLP和交叉注意力），将Wav2Vec2声学嵌入与Deformable DETR的多分辨率特征映射融合。使用Drone-vs-Bird数据集和新生成的ARDrone数据集（包含7500多个同步图像和音频片段）进行训练和测试。

Result: 最佳性能的门控融合方法将Deformable DETR目标检测器的mAP在ARDrone数据集上提高了11.1%到15.3%（小型无人机），中型和大型无人机的mAP也有所提升，总体增益在3.27%到5.84%之间。

Conclusion: 声学信息能够显著提升无人机目标检测性能，特别是在小型无人机检测方面，多模态融合方法在现实环境条件下表现出色。

Abstract: We introduce a multi-modal WAVE-DETR drone detector combining visible RGB and
acoustic signals for robust real-life UAV object detection. Our approach fuses
visual and acoustic features in a unified object detector model relying on the
Deformable DETR and Wav2Vec2 architectures, achieving strong performance under
challenging environmental conditions. Our work leverage the existing
Drone-vs-Bird dataset and the newly generated ARDrone dataset containing more
than 7,500 synchronized images and audio segments. We show how the acoustic
information is used to improve the performance of the Deformable DETR object
detector on the real ARDrone dataset. We developed, trained and tested four
different fusion configurations based on a gated mechanism, linear layer, MLP
and cross attention. The Wav2Vec2 acoustic embeddings are fused with the multi
resolution feature mappings of the Deformable DETR and enhance the object
detection performance over all drones dimensions. The best performer is the
gated fusion approach, which improves the mAP of the Deformable DETR object
detector on our in-distribution and out-of-distribution ARDrone datasets by
11.1% to 15.3% for small drones across all IoU thresholds between 0.5 and 0.9.
The mAP scores for medium and large drones are also enhanced, with overall
gains across all drone sizes ranging from 3.27% to 5.84%.

TL;DR: 提出了一种称为代理监督的新训练范式，通过将估计的空间变换应用于代理图像，将输入域与监督域解耦，从而在异构输入上训练配准网络，同时确保在相似性定义良好的域中进行监督。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于深度学习的可变形图像配准虽然精度高，但对输入图像特性（如伪影、视野不匹配或模态差异）的变化敏感，需要提高配准网络的鲁棒性和泛化性。

Method: 引入代理监督方法，将输入域与监督域解耦，通过将估计的空间变换应用于代理图像，在异构输入上进行训练，同时在相似性定义良好的域中计算监督信号。

Result: 在三个代表性应用（抗伪影脑MR配准、掩码无关肺CT配准和多模态MR配准）中，代理监督显示出对输入变化的强韧性，包括不均匀场、不一致视野和模态差异，同时在良好整理的数据上保持高性能。

Conclusion: 代理监督为训练鲁棒且可泛化的深度学习配准模型提供了一个原则性框架，且不增加复杂性，为更鲁棒和可泛化的医学图像配准提供了实用途径。

Abstract: Objective: Deep learning-based deformable image registration has achieved
strong accuracy, but remains sensitive to variations in input image
characteristics such as artifacts, field-of-view mismatch, or modality
difference. We aim to develop a general training paradigm that improves the
robustness and generalizability of registration networks. Methods: We introduce
surrogate supervision, which decouples the input domain from the supervision
domain by applying estimated spatial transformations to surrogate images. This
allows training on heterogeneous inputs while ensuring supervision is computed
in domains where similarity is well defined. We evaluate the framework through
three representative applications: artifact-robust brain MR registration,
mask-agnostic lung CT registration, and multi-modal MR registration. Results:
Across tasks, surrogate supervision demonstrated strong resilience to input
variations including inhomogeneity field, inconsistent field-of-view, and
modality differences, while maintaining high performance on well-curated data.
Conclusions: Surrogate supervision provides a principled framework for training
robust and generalizable deep learning-based registration models without
increasing complexity. Significance: Surrogate supervision offers a practical
pathway to more robust and generalizable medical image registration, enabling
broader applicability in diverse biomedical imaging scenarios.

Motivation: 深度学习在法医年龄估计等高风险应用中因'黑盒'特性而受限，需要提高模型性能和透明度

Method: 使用卷积自编码器(AE)与Vision Transformer(ViT)结合的框架，分析第二和第三磨牙的自动分期性能差异

Result: 分类准确率显著提升：牙齿37从0.712提高到0.815，牙齿38从0.462提高到0.543；AE分析表明剩余性能差距源于数据本身的高类内形态变异

Conclusion: 单一可解释性模式不足，需要多角度诊断方法；该框架既能提高准确性又能解释模型不确定性，为法医年龄估计提供更可靠的工具

Abstract: The practical adoption of deep learning in high-stakes forensic applications,
such as dental age estimation, is often limited by the 'black box' nature of
the models. This study introduces a framework designed to enhance both
performance and transparency in this context. We use a notable performance
disparity in the automated staging of mandibular second (tooth 37) and third
(tooth 38) molars as a case study. The proposed framework, which combines a
convolutional autoencoder (AE) with a Vision Transformer (ViT), improves
classification accuracy for both teeth over a baseline ViT, increasing from
0.712 to 0.815 for tooth 37 and from 0.462 to 0.543 for tooth 38. Beyond
improving performance, the framework provides multi-faceted diagnostic
insights. Analysis of the AE's latent space metrics and image reconstructions
indicates that the remaining performance gap is data-centric, suggesting high
intra-class morphological variability in the tooth 38 dataset is a primary
limiting factor. This work highlights the insufficiency of relying on a single
mode of interpretability, such as attention maps, which can appear anatomically
plausible yet fail to identify underlying data issues. By offering a
methodology that both enhances accuracy and provides evidence for why a model
may be uncertain, this framework serves as a more robust tool to support expert
decision-making in forensic age estimation.

<details>

Motivation: 现有SFDA方法依赖全监督预训练源模型，使用余弦相似度对齐实例级特征时丢弃了关键的几何流形信息，需要解决这些问题

Method: 使用自监督预训练初始化教师模型，通过几何流形对齐原则，结合实例级特征匹配和空间相似性损失训练学生模型，采用EMA更新教师参数防止灾难性遗忘

Result: 在基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，SCoDA显著优于最先进的SFDA方法

Conclusion: SCoDA通过自监督预训练和几何流形对齐，成功解决了SFDA中的关键限制，为无源域自适应提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Source-Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA) addresses the challenge of adapting a
model to a target domain without access to the data of the source domain.
Prevailing methods typically start with a source model pre-trained with full
supervision and distill the knowledge by aligning instance-level features.
However, these approaches, relying on cosine similarity over L2-normalized
feature vectors, inadvertently discard crucial geometric information about the
latent manifold of the source model. We introduce Self-supervised Continual
Domain Adaptation (SCoDA) to address these limitations. We make two key
departures from standard practice: first, we avoid the reliance on supervised
pre-training by initializing the proposed framework with a teacher model
pre-trained entirely via self-supervision (SSL). Second, we adapt the principle
of geometric manifold alignment to the SFDA setting. The student is trained
with a composite objective combining instance-level feature matching with a
Space Similarity Loss. To combat catastrophic forgetting, the teacher's
parameters are updated via an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of the student's
parameters. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that SCoDA
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art SFDA methods.

Result: 在2D和大规模3D时间延迟显微镜视频中达到竞争性的精度，无需数据集特定适配

Conclusion: 该方法免除了对特定训练数据的依赖，能够良好地渗透到多样化的显微镜数据集

Abstract: Tracking cells and detecting mitotic events in time-lapse microscopy image
sequences is a crucial task in biomedical research. However, it remains highly
challenging due to dividing objects, low signal-tonoise ratios, indistinct
boundaries, dense clusters, and the visually similar appearance of individual
cells. Existing deep learning-based methods rely on manually labeled datasets
for training, which is both costly and time-consuming. Moreover, their
generalizability to unseen datasets remains limited due to the vast diversity
of microscopy data. To overcome these limitations, we propose a zero-shot cell
tracking framework by integrating Segment Anything 2 (SAM2), a large foundation
model designed for general image and video segmentation, into the tracking
pipeline. As a fully-unsupervised approach, our method does not depend on or
inherit biases from any specific training dataset, allowing it to generalize
across diverse microscopy datasets without finetuning. Our approach achieves
competitive accuracy in both 2D and large-scale 3D time-lapse microscopy videos
while eliminating the need for dataset-specific adaptation.

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效将现有2D多摄像头跟踪系统扩展到3D空间，为大规模监控提供了一种可行的解决方案

Abstract: Multi-Target Multi-Camera Tracking (MTMC) is an essential computer vision
task for automating large-scale surveillance. With camera calibration and depth
information, the targets in the scene can be projected into 3D space, offering
unparalleled levels of automatic perception of a 3D environment. However,
tracking in the 3D space requires replacing all 2D tracking components from the
ground up, which may be infeasible for existing MTMC systems. In this paper, we
present an approach for extending any online 2D multi-camera tracking system
into 3D space by utilizing depth information to reconstruct a target in
point-cloud space, and recovering its 3D box through clustering and yaw
refinement following tracking. We also introduced an enhanced online data
association mechanism that leverages the target's local ID consistency to
assign global IDs across frames. The proposed framework is evaluated on the
2025 AI City Challenge's 3D MTMC dataset, achieving 3rd place on the
leaderboard.

Result: 在RefCOCO、RefCOCO+、RefCOCOg数据集上，超越了零样本GroundingDINO基线，甚至超过了经过REC训练的GroundingDINO和GroundingDINO+CRG的报告结果

Conclusion: 工作流程设计比任务特定预训练更能推动零样本REC性能，验证方法显著优于选择基于提示方法

Abstract: Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) is usually addressed with
task-trained grounding models. We show that a zero-shot workflow, without any
REC-specific training, can achieve competitive or superior performance. Our
approach reformulates REC as box-wise visual-language verification: given
proposals from a COCO-clean generic detector (YOLO-World), a general-purpose
VLM independently answers True/False queries for each region. This simple
procedure reduces cross-box interference, supports abstention and multiple
matches, and requires no fine-tuning. On RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, and RefCOCOg, our
method not only surpasses a zero-shot GroundingDINO baseline but also exceeds
reported results for GroundingDINO trained on REC and GroundingDINO+CRG.
Controlled studies with identical proposals confirm that verification
significantly outperforms selection-based prompting, and results hold with open
VLMs. Overall, we show that workflow design, rather than task-specific
pretraining, drives strong zero-shot REC performance.

Result: 实验表明该方法显著提升了虫害类别的分割性能，同时保持甚至略微提高了其他类别的准确率

Conclusion: 目标导向的数据增强能有效缓解极端像素不平衡问题，为农业分割问题提供了简单而有效的解决方案

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of foliar diseases and insect damage in wheat is
crucial for effective crop management and disease control. However, the insect
damage typically occupies only a tiny fraction of annotated pixels. This
extreme pixel-level imbalance poses a significant challenge to the segmentation
performance, which can result in overfitting to common classes and insufficient
learning of rare classes, thereby impairing overall performance. In this paper,
we propose a Random Projected Copy-and-Paste (RPCP) augmentation technique to
address the pixel imbalance problem. Specifically, we extract rare
insect-damage patches from annotated training images and apply random geometric
transformations to simulate variations. The transformed patches are then pasted
in appropriate regions while avoiding overlaps with lesions or existing damaged
regions. In addition, we apply a random projection filter to the pasted
regions, refining local features and ensuring a natural blend with the new
background. Experiments show that our method substantially improves
segmentation performance on the insect damage class, while maintaining or even
slightly enhancing accuracy on other categories. Our results highlight the
effectiveness of targeted augmentation in mitigating extreme pixel imbalance,
offering a straightforward yet effective solution for agricultural segmentation
problems.

Abstract: Visual Inertial Odometry (VIO) is a widely used computer vision method that
determines an agent's movement through a camera and an IMU sensor. This paper
presents an efficient and accurate VIO pipeline optimized for applications on
micro- and nano-UAVs. The proposed design incorporates state-of-the-art feature
detection and tracking methods (SuperPoint, PX4FLOW, ORB), all optimized and
quantized for emerging RISC-V-based ultra-low-power parallel systems on chips
(SoCs). Furthermore, by employing a rigid body motion model, the pipeline
reduces estimation errors and achieves improved accuracy in planar motion
scenarios. The pipeline's suitability for real-time VIO is assessed on an
ultra-low-power SoC in terms of compute requirements and tracking accuracy
after quantization. The pipeline, including the three feature tracking methods,
was implemented on the SoC for real-world validation. This design bridges the
gap between high-accuracy VIO pipelines that are traditionally run on
computationally powerful systems and lightweight implementations suitable for
microcontrollers. The optimized pipeline on the GAP9 low-power SoC demonstrates
an average reduction in RMSE of up to a factor of 3.65x over the baseline
pipeline when using the ORB feature tracker. The analysis of the computational
complexity of the feature trackers further shows that PX4FLOW achieves on-par
tracking accuracy with ORB at a lower runtime for movement speeds below 24
pixels/frame.

Conclusion: 提出的HMM框架能够有效利用间歇性身份信息，显著改善长期多目标跟踪性能，尤其适用于动物监测等实际应用场景

Abstract: The need for long-term multi-object tracking (MOT) is growing due to the
demand for analyzing individual behaviors in videos that span several minutes.
Unfortunately, due to identity switches between objects, the tracking
performance of existing MOT approaches decreases over time, making them
difficult to apply for long-term tracking. However, in many real-world
applications, such as in the livestock sector, it is possible to obtain
sporadic identifications for some of the animals from sources like feeders. To
address the challenges of long-term MOT, we propose a new framework that
combines both uncertain identities and tracking using a Hidden Markov Model
(HMM) formulation. In addition to providing real-world identities to animals,
our HMM framework improves the F1 score of ByteTrack, a leading MOT approach
even with re-identification, on a 10 minute pig tracking dataset with 21
identifications at the pen's feeding station. We also show that our approach is
robust to the uncertainty of identifications, with performance increasing as
identities are provided more frequently. The improved performance of our HMM
framework was also validated on the MOT17 and MOT20 benchmark datasets using
both ByteTrack and FairMOT. The code for this new HMM framework and the new
10-minute pig tracking video dataset are available at:

Abstract: Event camera sensors are bio-inspired sensors which asynchronously capture
per-pixel brightness changes and output a stream of events encoding the
polarity, location and time of these changes. These systems are witnessing
rapid advancements as an emerging field, driven by their low latency, reduced
power consumption, and ultra-high capture rates. This survey explores the
evolution of fusing event-stream captured with traditional frame-based capture,
highlighting how this synergy significantly benefits various video restoration
and 3D reconstruction tasks. The paper systematically reviews major deep
learning contributions to image/video enhancement and restoration, focusing on
two dimensions: temporal enhancement (such as frame interpolation and motion
deblurring) and spatial enhancement (including super-resolution, low-light and
HDR enhancement, and artifact reduction). This paper also explores how the 3D
reconstruction domain evolves with the advancement of event driven fusion.
Diverse topics are covered, with in-depth discussions on recent works for
improving visual quality under challenging conditions. Additionally, the survey
compiles a comprehensive list of openly available datasets, enabling
reproducible research and benchmarking. By consolidating recent progress and
insights, this survey aims to inspire further research into leveraging event
camera systems, especially in combination with deep learning, for advanced
visual media restoration and enhancement.

Conclusion: ISTASTrack证明了ANN-SNN混合设计在鲁棒视觉跟踪中的有效性和实用性，为跨模态特征融合提供了新思路。

Abstract: RGB-Event tracking has become a promising trend in visual object tracking to
leverage the complementary strengths of both RGB images and dynamic spike
events for improved performance. However, existing artificial neural networks
(ANNs) struggle to fully exploit the sparse and asynchronous nature of event
streams. Recent efforts toward hybrid architectures combining ANNs and spiking
neural networks (SNNs) have emerged as a promising solution in RGB-Event
perception, yet effectively fusing features across heterogeneous paradigms
remains a challenge. In this work, we propose ISTASTrack, the first
transformer-based \textbf{A}NN-\textbf{S}NN hybrid \textbf{Track}er equipped
with \textbf{ISTA} adapters for RGB-Event tracking. The two-branch model
employs a vision transformer to extract spatial context from RGB inputs and a
spiking transformer to capture spatio-temporal dynamics from event streams. To
bridge the modality and paradigm gap between ANN and SNN features, we
systematically design a model-based ISTA adapter for bidirectional feature
interaction between the two branches, derived from sparse representation theory
by unfolding the iterative shrinkage thresholding algorithm. Additionally, we
incorporate a temporal downsampling attention module within the adapter to
align multi-step SNN features with single-step ANN features in the latent
space, improving temporal fusion. Experimental results on RGB-Event tracking
benchmarks, such as FE240hz, VisEvent, COESOT, and FELT, have demonstrated that
ISTASTrack achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining high energy
efficiency, highlighting the effectiveness and practicality of hybrid ANN-SNN
designs for robust visual tracking. The code is publicly available at

of solar flare forecasting is insufficient. In this study, we address the task
of predicting the class of the largest solar flare expected to occur within the
next 72 hours. Existing methods often fail to adequately address the severe
class imbalance across flare classes. To address this issue, we propose a solar
flare prediction model based on multiple deep state space models. In addition,
we introduce the frequency & local-boundary-aware reliability loss (FLARE loss)
to improve predictive performance and reliability under class imbalance.
Experiments were conducted on a multi-wavelength solar image dataset covering a
full 11-year solar activity cycle. As a result, our method outperformed
baseline approaches in terms of both the Gandin-Murphy-Gerrity score and the
true skill statistic, which are standard metrics in terms of the performance
and reliability.

TL;DR: TUNI是一个RGB-热成像语义分割模型，通过统一的编码器同时进行多模态特征提取和跨模态融合，采用大规模预训练和精简热分支架构，实现了高效实时的性能。

Conclusion: TUNI通过统一的编码器架构和有效的跨模态融合机制，在保持高性能的同时显著提升了模型的实时部署能力。

Abstract: RGB-thermal (RGB-T) semantic segmentation improves the environmental
perception of autonomous platforms in challenging conditions. Prevailing models
employ encoders pre-trained on RGB images to extract features from both RGB and
infrared inputs, and design additional modules to achieve cross-modal feature
fusion. This results in limited thermal feature extraction and suboptimal
cross-modal fusion, while the redundant encoders further compromises the
model's real-time efficiency. To address the above issues, we propose TUNI,
with an RGB-T encoder consisting of multiple stacked blocks that simultaneously
perform multi-modal feature extraction and cross-modal fusion. By leveraging
large-scale pre-training with RGB and pseudo-thermal data, the RGB-T encoder
learns to integrate feature extraction and fusion in a unified manner. By
slimming down the thermal branch, the encoder achieves a more compact
architecture. Moreover, we introduce an RGB-T local module to strengthen the
encoder's capacity for cross-modal local feature fusion. The RGB-T local module
employs adaptive cosine similarity to selectively emphasize salient consistent
and distinct local features across RGB-T modalities. Experimental results show
that TUNI achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art models on FMB,
PST900 and CART, with fewer parameters and lower computational cost. Meanwhile,
it achieves an inference speed of 27 FPS on a Jetson Orin NX, demonstrating its
real-time capability in deployment. Codes are available at

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel model of few-part-shot font generation, which
designs an entire font based on a set of partial design elements, i.e., partial
shapes. Unlike conventional few-shot font generation, which requires entire
character shapes for a couple of character classes, our approach only needs
partial shapes as input. The proposed model not only improves the efficiency of
font creation but also provides insights into how partial design details
influence the entire structure of the individual characters.

Abstract: Recovering 3D face models from 2D in-the-wild images has gained considerable
attention in the computer vision community due to its wide range of potential
applications. However, the lack of ground-truth labeled datasets and the
complexity of real-world environments remain significant challenges. In this
chapter, we propose a convolutional neural network-based approach, the
Hierarchical Multi-Level Attention Network (MLANet), for reconstructing 3D face
models from single in-the-wild images. Our model predicts detailed facial
geometry, texture, pose, and illumination parameters from a single image.
Specifically, we employ a pre-trained hierarchical backbone network and
introduce multi-level attention mechanisms at different stages of 2D face image
feature extraction. A semi-supervised training strategy is employed,
incorporating 3D Morphable Model (3DMM) parameters from publicly available
datasets along with a differentiable renderer, enabling an end-to-end training
process. Extensive experiments, including both comparative and ablation
studies, were conducted on two benchmark datasets, AFLW2000-3D and MICC
Florence, focusing on 3D face reconstruction and 3D face alignment tasks. The
effectiveness of the proposed method was evaluated both quantitatively and
qualitatively.

Method: 提出多阶段推理流程（文本摘要+边界框、语言识别、空间对象级描述、逐步逻辑推理），采用自动化数据标注方法，结合监督微调和语言感知组相对策略优化的两阶段训练范式。

Result: 在MMMB、Multilingual MMBench和MTVQA等数据集上，比同规模开源基线提升~9.5%准确率，超越2倍规模模型~2.6%，优于GPT-4o-0513和Gemini-2.5-flash等专有模型。

Conclusion: LaV-CoT通过语言感知的视觉思维链框架和多方面奖励优化，有效提升了多语言视觉问答的性能和泛化能力，具有工业部署价值。

Abstract: As large vision language models (VLMs) advance, their capabilities in
multilingual visual question answering (mVQA) have significantly improved.
Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning has been proven to enhance interpretability
and complex reasoning. However, most existing approaches rely primarily on
textual CoT and provide limited support for multilingual multimodal reasoning,
constraining their deployment in real-world applications. To address this gap,
we introduce \textbf{LaV-CoT}, the first Language-aware Visual CoT framework
with Multi-Aspect Reward Optimization. LaV-CoT incorporates an interpretable
multi-stage reasoning pipeline consisting of Text Summary with Bounding Box
(BBox), Language Identification, Spatial Object-level Captioning, and
Step-by-step Logical Reasoning. Following this reasoning pipeline, we design an
automated data curation method that generates multilingual CoT annotations
through iterative generation, correction, and refinement, enabling scalable and
high-quality training data. To improve reasoning and generalization, LaV-CoT
adopts a two-stage training paradigm combining Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)
with Language-aware Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), guided by
verifiable multi-aspect rewards including language consistency, structural
accuracy, and semantic alignment. Extensive evaluations on public datasets
including MMMB, Multilingual MMBench, and MTVQA show that LaV-CoT achieves up
to \(\sim\)9.5\% accuracy improvements over open-source baselines of similar
size and even surpasses models with 2$\times$ larger scales by \(\sim\)2.6\%.
Moreover, LaV-CoT outperforms advanced proprietary models such as GPT-4o-0513
and Gemini-2.5-flash. We further conducted an online A/B test to validate our
method on real-world data, highlighting its effectiveness for industrial
deployment. Our code is available at this link:

Conclusion: 该训练免费框架能有效解决文本到图像生成中的颜色模糊问题，无需额外训练或参考图像，提升了颜色保真度

Abstract: Accurate color alignment in text-to-image (T2I) generation is critical for
applications such as fashion, product visualization, and interior design, yet
current diffusion models struggle with nuanced and compound color terms (e.g.,
Tiffany blue, lime green, hot pink), often producing images that are misaligned
with human intent. Existing approaches rely on cross-attention manipulation,
reference images, or fine-tuning but fail to systematically resolve ambiguous
color descriptions. To precisely render colors under prompt ambiguity, we
propose a training-free framework that enhances color fidelity by leveraging a
large language model (LLM) to disambiguate color-related prompts and guiding
color blending operations directly in the text embedding space. Our method
first employs a large language model (LLM) to resolve ambiguous color terms in
the text prompt, and then refines the text embeddings based on the spatial
relationships of the resulting color terms in the CIELAB color space. Unlike
prior methods, our approach improves color accuracy without requiring
additional training or external reference images. Experimental results
demonstrate that our framework improves color alignment without compromising
image quality, bridging the gap between text semantics and visual generation.

Abstract: Mathematical reasoning is critical for tasks such as precise distance and
area computations, trajectory estimations, and spatial analysis in unmanned
aerial vehicle (UAV) based remote sensing, yet current vision-language models
(VLMs) have not been adequately tested in this domain. To address this gap, we
introduce AVI-Math, the first benchmark to rigorously evaluate multimodal
mathematical reasoning in aerial vehicle imagery, moving beyond simple counting
tasks to include domain-specific knowledge in areas such as geometry, logic,
and algebra. The dataset comprises 3,773 high-quality vehicle-related questions
captured from UAV views, covering 6 mathematical subjects and 20 topics. The
data, collected at varying altitudes and from multiple UAV angles, reflects
real-world UAV scenarios, ensuring the diversity and complexity of the
constructed mathematical problems. In this paper, we benchmark 14 prominent
VLMs through a comprehensive evaluation and demonstrate that, despite their
success on previous multimodal benchmarks, these models struggle with the
reasoning tasks in AVI-Math. Our detailed analysis highlights significant
limitations in the mathematical reasoning capabilities of current VLMs and
suggests avenues for future research. Furthermore, we explore the use of
Chain-of-Thought prompting and fine-tuning techniques, which show promise in
addressing the reasoning challenges in AVI-Math. Our findings not only expose
the limitations of VLMs in mathematical reasoning but also offer valuable
insights for advancing UAV-based trustworthy VLMs in real-world applications.

Conclusion: BEVTraj成功克服了传统地图依赖方法的局限性，为自动驾驶轨迹预测提供了更灵活高效的解决方案，源代码已开源。

Abstract: In autonomous driving, trajectory prediction is essential for ensuring safe
and efficient navigation. To improve prediction accuracy, recent approaches
often rely on pre-built high-definition (HD) maps or real-time local map
construction modules to incorporate static environmental information. However,
pre-built HD maps are limited to specific regions and cannot adapt to transient
changes. In addition, local map construction modules, which recognize only
predefined elements, may fail to capture critical scene details or introduce
errors that degrade prediction performance. To overcome these limitations, we
propose Bird's-Eye View Trajectory Prediction (BEVTraj), a novel trajectory
prediction framework that operates directly in the bird's-eye view (BEV) space
utilizing real-time sensor data without relying on any pre-built maps. The
BEVTraj leverages deformable attention to efficiently extract relevant context
from dense BEV features. Furthermore, we introduce a Sparse Goal Candidate
Proposal (SGCP) module, which enables full end-to-end prediction without
requiring any post-processing steps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the
BEVTraj achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art HD map-based models
while offering greater flexibility by eliminating the dependency on pre-built
maps. The source code is available at https://github.com/Kongminsang/bevtraj.

Result: 在遮挡场景下相比基线模型获得4.20%的相对性能提升

Conclusion: 多视角信息能有效提升多人体解析在遮挡情况下的表现

Abstract: Multi-human parsing is the task of segmenting human body parts while
associating each part to the person it belongs to, combining instance-level and
part-level information for fine-grained human understanding. In this work, we
demonstrate that, while state-of-the-art approaches achieved notable results on
public datasets, they struggle considerably in segmenting people with
overlapping bodies. From the intuition that overlapping people may appear
separated from a different point of view, we propose a novel training framework
exploiting multi-view information to improve multi-human parsing models under
occlusions. Our method integrates such knowledge during the training process,
introducing a novel approach based on weak supervision on human instances and a
multi-view consistency loss. Given the lack of suitable datasets in the
literature, we propose a semi-automatic annotation strategy to generate human
instance segmentation masks from multi-view RGB+D data and 3D human skeletons.
The experiments demonstrate that the approach can achieve up to a 4.20\%
relative improvement on human parsing over the baseline model in occlusion
scenarios.

abilities and improving safety via preference optimization. Extensive benchmark
evaluations demonstrate strong spatial grounding and competitive results for
both languages, with the 14B model achieving 8th place on the OpenCompass VLM

Conclusion: 该方法在准确性和计算效率之间得到了良好平衡，适合在实际环境中部署面部识别和验证系统。

Abstract: Face image quality assessment (FIQA) plays a critical role in face
recognition and verification systems, especially in uncontrolled, real-world
environments. Although several methods have been proposed, general-purpose
no-reference image quality assessment techniques often fail to capture
face-specific degradations. Meanwhile, state-of-the-art FIQA models tend to be
computationally intensive, limiting their practical applicability. We propose a
lightweight and efficient method for FIQA, designed for the perceptual
evaluation of face images in the wild. Our approach integrates an ensemble of
two compact convolutional neural networks, MobileNetV3-Small and ShuffleNetV2,
with prediction-level fusion via simple averaging. To enhance alignment with
human perceptual judgments, we employ a correlation-aware loss (MSECorrLoss),
combining mean squared error (MSE) with a Pearson correlation regularizer. Our
method achieves a strong balance between accuracy and computational cost,
making it suitable for real-world deployment. Experiments on the VQualA FIQA
benchmark demonstrate that our model achieves a Spearman rank correlation
coefficient (SRCC) of 0.9829 and a Pearson linear correlation coefficient
(PLCC) of 0.9894, remaining within competition efficiency constraints.

Abstract: Pre-trained diffusion models have shown great potential in real-world image
super-resolution (Real-ISR) tasks by enabling high-resolution reconstructions.
While one-step diffusion (OSD) methods significantly improve efficiency
compared to traditional multi-step approaches, they still have limitations in
balancing fidelity and realism across diverse scenarios. Since the OSDs for SR
are usually trained or distilled by a single timestep, they lack flexible
control mechanisms to adaptively prioritize these competing objectives, which
are inherently manageable in multi-step methods through adjusting sampling
steps. To address this challenge, we propose a Realism Controlled One-step
Diffusion (RCOD) framework for Real-ISR. RCOD provides a latent domain grouping
strategy that enables explicit control over fidelity-realism trade-offs during
the noise prediction phase with minimal training paradigm modifications and
original training data. A degradation-aware sampling strategy is also
introduced to align distillation regularization with the grouping strategy and
enhance the controlling of trade-offs. Moreover, a visual prompt injection
module is used to replace conventional text prompts with degradation-aware
visual tokens, enhancing both restoration accuracy and semantic consistency.
Our method achieves superior fidelity and perceptual quality while maintaining
computational efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RCOD
outperforms state-of-the-art OSD methods in both quantitative metrics and
visual qualities, with flexible realism control capabilities in the inference
stage. The code will be released.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of the optic disc and cup is critical for the early
diagnosis and management of ocular diseases such as glaucoma. However,
segmentation models trained on one dataset often suffer significant performance
degradation when applied to target data acquired under different imaging
protocols or conditions. To address this challenge, we propose
\textbf{Grad-CL}, a novel source-free domain adaptation framework that
leverages a pre-trained source model and unlabeled target data to robustly
adapt segmentation performance without requiring access to the original source
data. Grad-CL combines a gradient-guided pseudolabel refinement module with a
cosine similarity-based contrastive learning strategy. In the first stage,
salient class-specific features are extracted via a gradient-based mechanism,
enabling more accurate uncertainty quantification and robust prototype
estimation for refining noisy pseudolabels. In the second stage, a contrastive
loss based on cosine similarity is employed to explicitly enforce inter-class
separability between the gradient-informed features of the optic cup and disc.
Extensive experiments on challenging cross-domain fundus imaging datasets
demonstrate that Grad-CL outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised and
source-free domain adaptation methods, achieving superior segmentation accuracy
and improved boundary delineation. Project and code are available at

Abstract: Vector quantization (VQ) is a key component in discrete tokenizers for image
generation, but its training is often unstable due to straight-through
estimation bias, one-step-behind updates, and sparse codebook gradients, which
lead to suboptimal reconstruction performance and low codebook usage. In this
work, we analyze these fundamental challenges and provide a simple yet
effective solution. To maintain high codebook usage in VQ networks (VQN) during
learning annealing and codebook size expansion, we propose VQBridge, a robust,
scalable, and efficient projector based on the map function method. VQBridge
optimizes code vectors through a compress-process-recover pipeline, enabling
stable and effective codebook training. By combining VQBridge with learning
annealing, our VQN achieves full (100%) codebook usage across diverse codebook
configurations, which we refer to as FVQ (FullVQ). Through extensive
experiments, we demonstrate that FVQ is effective, scalable, and generalizable:
it attains 100% codebook usage even with a 262k-codebook, achieves
state-of-the-art reconstruction performance, consistently improves with larger
codebooks, higher vector channels, or longer training, and remains effective
across different VQ variants. Moreover, when integrated with LlamaGen, FVQ

TL;DR: LayerLock通过渐进层冻结技术加速视频MAE训练，先冻结浅层后冻结深层，无需特殊调整即可避免表征冲击问题，在4B参数模型上超越传统MAE方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 观察到ViT模型在视频MAE训练中，浅层先收敛深层后收敛的现象，希望利用这一规律来加速训练过程并避免表征冲击问题。

Method: 提出渐进层冻结方法，按照预先设计的时间表逐步冻结模型的各层，从像素预测平滑过渡到潜在表征预测。

Result: 在达到4B参数的大模型上，LayerLock方法在4DS感知套件中表现超过了传统的非潜在预测MAE方法。

Conclusion: 通过利用ViT模型层次收敛的自然规律，LayerLock提供了一种简单有效的自监督学习方法，能够在大规模模型上实现更好的表征学习效果。

Abstract: We introduce LayerLock, a simple yet effective approach for self-supervised
visual representation learning, that gradually transitions from pixel to latent
prediction through progressive layer freezing. First, we make the observation
that during training of video masked-autoencoding (MAE) models, ViT layers
converge in the order of their depth: shallower layers converge early, deeper
layers converge late. We then show that this observation can be exploited to
accelerate standard MAE by progressively freezing the model according to an
explicit schedule, throughout training. Furthermore, this same schedule can be
used in a simple and scalable approach to latent prediction that does not
suffer from "representation collapse". We apply our proposed approach,
LayerLock, to large models of up to 4B parameters with results surpassing those
of non-latent masked prediction on the 4DS perception suite.

*Elias De Smijter,Renaud Detry,Christophe De Vleeschouwer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文系统比较了隐式和显式新视角合成方法在太空基地物体重建中的表现，特别重点分析了外观嵌入的作用，发现外观嵌入虽能提升照明保真度但无法显著提高几何精度，而凸图球拆分方法在表示效率和安全性方面优于高斯图球拆分。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究外观嵌入在太空机器人应用中对于三维物体重建几何精度的实际影响，识别重建质量与表示效率之间的权衡。

Method: 使用SPEED+数据集，对比分析K-Planes、高斯图球拆分和凸图球拆分三种方法，重点考察外观嵌入对照明保真度和几何精度的影响。

Result: 外观嵌入主要减少显式方法所需的基元数量，而非提升几何保真度；凸图球拆分比高斯图球拆分更紧凑且杂乱更少，更适合安全关键应用。

Conclusion: 外观嵌入在以几何为中心的任务中有限，在太空场景中需要在重建质量与表示效率之间进行权衡。

Abstract: We present the first systematic comparison of implicit and explicit Novel
View Synthesis methods for space-based 3D object reconstruction, evaluating the
role of appearance embeddings. While embeddings improve photometric fidelity by
modeling lighting variation, we show they do not translate into meaningful
gains in geometric accuracy - a critical requirement for space robotics
applications. Using the SPEED+ dataset, we compare K-Planes, Gaussian
Splatting, and Convex Splatting, and demonstrate that embeddings primarily
reduce the number of primitives needed for explicit methods rather than
enhancing geometric fidelity. Moreover, convex splatting achieves more compact
and clutter-free representations than Gaussian splatting, offering advantages
for safety-critical applications such as interaction and collision avoidance.
Our findings clarify the limits of appearance embeddings for geometry-centric
tasks and highlight trade-offs between reconstruction quality and
representation efficiency in space scenarios.

Motivation: 现有AI生成图像检测器主要依赖特定生成模型的伪影特征，在面对新的生成模型时泛化能力有限，需要解决领域偏差问题。

Method: 提出GAMMA训练框架，采用多样化的操作策略（如修复操作和语义保持扰动），多任务监督机制（双分割头和分类头），以及反向交叉注意力机制来纠正分类分支的偏差表示。

Result: 在GenImage基准上达到最先进的泛化性能，准确率提升5.8%，并对新发布的GPT-4o等生成模型保持强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: GAMMA通过减少领域偏差和增强语义对齐，显著提升了AI生成图像检测器对未知生成模型的泛化能力，为解决生成模型多样性带来的检测挑战提供了有效方案。

Abstract: With generative models becoming increasingly sophisticated and diverse,
detecting AI-generated images has become increasingly challenging. While
existing AI-genereted Image detectors achieve promising performance on
in-distribution generated images, their generalization to unseen generative
models remains limited. This limitation is largely attributed to their reliance
on generation-specific artifacts, such as stylistic priors and compression
patterns. To address these limitations, we propose GAMMA, a novel training
framework designed to reduce domain bias and enhance semantic alignment. GAMMA
introduces diverse manipulation strategies, such as inpainting-based
manipulation and semantics-preserving perturbations, to ensure consistency
between manipulated and authentic content. We employ multi-task supervision
with dual segmentation heads and a classification head, enabling pixel-level
source attribution across diverse generative domains. In addition, a reverse
cross-attention mechanism is introduced to allow the segmentation heads to
guide and correct biased representations in the classification branch. Our
method achieves state-of-the-art generalization performance on the GenImage
benchmark, imporving accuracy by 5.8%, but also maintains strong robustness on
newly released generative model such as GPT-4o.

*Ema Masterl,Tina Vipotnik Vesnaver,Žiga Špiclin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文比较了三种胎儿脑部MRI超分辨率重建方法(NiftyMIC、SVRTK、NeSVoR)在健康和病理案例中的性能差异，发现NeSVoR具有最高的重建成功率，而诊断性能不受重建方法选择的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胎儿脑部MRI存在分辨率低、运动伪影和3D解剖信息不充分等问题。虽然已有多种超分辨率重建方法，但它们在病理案例中的比较性能和对下游分析任务的影响仍未得到充分研究。

Method: 对140例胎儿脑部MRI扫描(包括健康对照组和脑室扩大病理案例)进行三种SRR方法的重建，使用BoUNTi算法分割九个主要脑部结构，并评估视觉质量、重建成功率、体积测量一致性和诊断分类性能。

Result: NeSVoR在健康和病理组都显示了最高和最一致的重建成功率(>90%)。虽然不同SRR方法在体积估计上存在显著差异，但脑室扩大的分类诊断性能并未受到SRR方法选择的影响。

Conclusion: NeSVoR方法具有更高的稳健性，而诊断性能在SRR导致的体积变异情况下仍保持鲁棒性，这为临床应用提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Fetal brain MRI relies on rapid multi-view 2D slice acquisitions to reduce
motion artifacts caused by fetal movement. However, these stacks are typically
low resolution, may suffer from motion corruption, and do not adequately
capture 3D anatomy. Super-resolution reconstruction (SRR) methods aim to
address these limitations by combining slice-to-volume registration and
super-resolution techniques to generate high-resolution (HR) 3D volumes. While
several SRR methods have been proposed, their comparative performance -
particularly in pathological cases - and their influence on downstream
volumetric analysis and diagnostic tasks remain underexplored. In this study,
we applied three state-of-the-art SRR method - NiftyMIC, SVRTK, and NeSVoR - to
140 fetal brain MRI scans, including both healthy controls (HC) and
pathological cases (PC) with ventriculomegaly (VM). Each HR reconstruction was
segmented using the BoUNTi algorithm to extract volumes of nine principal brain
structures. We evaluated visual quality, SRR success rates, volumetric
measurement agreement, and diagnostic classification performance. NeSVoR
demonstrated the highest and most consistent reconstruction success rate (>90%)
across both HC and PC groups. Although significant differences in volumetric
estimates were observed between SRR methods, classification performance for VM
was not affected by the choice of SRR method. These findings highlight NeSVoR's
robustness and the resilience of diagnostic performance despite SRR-induced
volumetric variability.

TL;DR: 通过提出面具一致性正则化(MCR)训练策略，解决了图像修补中的面具幻觉和面具形状偏巾两大挑战，提升了物体移除的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的涵盖模型在物体移除任务中存在两个关键问题：面具幻觉(在遮罩区域生成无关内容)和面具形状偏巾(生成与面具形状相似而非与周围内容相匹配的物体)。

Method: 提出面具一致性正则化(MCR)训练策略，在训练中引入两种面具批动：扩张和重形。扩张面具帮助对齐模型输出与周围内容，重形面具鼓励模型突破面具形状偏巾。

Result: 实验表明MCR显著减少了幻觉现象和面具形状偏巾，在物体移除任务中实现了更好的性能。

Conclusion: MCR通过面具批动和一致性正则化，能够生成更稳健和上下文一致的图像修补结果，有效解决了当前涵盖模型在物体移除中的关键挑战。

Abstract: Object removal, a challenging task within image inpainting, involves
seamlessly filling the removed region with content that matches the surrounding
context. Despite advancements in diffusion models, current methods still face
two critical challenges. The first is mask hallucination, where the model
generates irrelevant or spurious content inside the masked region, and the
second is mask-shape bias, where the model fills the masked area with an object
that mimics the mask's shape rather than surrounding content. To address these
issues, we propose Mask Consistency Regularization (MCR), a novel training
strategy designed specifically for object removal tasks. During training, our
approach introduces two mask perturbations: dilation and reshape, enforcing
consistency between the outputs of these perturbed branches and the original
mask. The dilated masks help align the model's output with the surrounding
content, while reshaped masks encourage the model to break the mask-shape bias.
This combination of strategies enables MCR to produce more robust and
contextually coherent inpainting results. Our experiments demonstrate that MCR
significantly reduces hallucinations and mask-shape bias, leading to improved
performance in object removal.

Motivation: 当前文本到图像生成模型在物理伪影（如解剖和结构缺陷）方面存在严重问题，缺乏系统性和细粒度的评估框架来量化这些问题

Method: 1) 建立生成图像伪影的详细分类法 2) 人工标注34万张生成图像的细粒度伪影标签数据集 3) 训练视觉语言模型MagicAssessor进行评估 4) 设计新颖的数据采样策略和多级奖励系统用于GRPO训练 5) 构建自动化基准MagicBench

Conclusion: MagicMirror框架为T2I生成模型的伪影评估提供了系统性解决方案，揭示了当前模型在物理合理性方面的严重不足，为未来改进指明了方向

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) generation has achieved remarkable progress in
instruction following and aesthetics. However, a persistent challenge is the
prevalence of physical artifacts, such as anatomical and structural flaws,
which severely degrade perceptual quality and limit application. Given the
diversity and complexity of these artifacts, a systematic and fine-grained
evaluation framework is required, which is lacking in current benchmarks. To
fill this gap, we introduce MagicMirror, a comprehensive framework for
artifacts assessment. We first establish a detailed taxonomy of generated image
artifacts. Guided by this taxonomy, we manually annotate MagicData340K, the
first human-annotated large-scale dataset of 340K generated images with
fine-grained artifact labels. Building on this dataset, we train MagicAssessor,
a Vision-Language Model (VLM) that provides detailed assessments and
corresponding labels. To overcome challenges like class imbalance and reward
hacking, we design a novel data sampling strategy and a multi-level reward
system for Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Finally, we leverage
MagicAssessor to construct MagicBench, an automated benchmark for evaluating
the image artifacts of current T2I models. Our evaluation with MagicBench
reveals that despite their widespread adoption, even top-tier models like
GPT-image-1 are consistently plagued by significant artifacts, highlighting
artifact reduction as a critical frontier for future T2I development. Project

TL;DR: SignClip是一个新颖的手语翻译框架，通过融合手势和唇部运动特征，并采用分层对比学习来提高翻译准确性，在PHOENIX14T和How2Sign数据集上取得了state-of-the-art性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有手语翻译方法主要关注手势信号，往往忽视口型等非手动线索，而口型在手语中传递重要语言信息，对区分视觉相似手势至关重要。

Method: 提出SignClip框架，融合空间手势和唇部运动特征；引入分层对比学习框架，具有多级对齐目标，确保跨手语-唇部和视觉-文本模态的语义一致性。

Result: 在PHOENIX14T数据集的无标注设置下，BLEU-4从24.32提升到24.71，ROUGE从46.57提升到48.38，超越了之前的state-of-the-art模型SpaMo。

Conclusion: SignClip通过有效融合手动和非手动线索，显著提升了手语翻译的准确性，证明了多模态信息融合的重要性。

Abstract: Sign language translation (SLT) aims to translate natural language from sign
language videos, serving as a vital bridge for inclusive communication. While
recent advances leverage powerful visual backbones and large language models,
most approaches mainly focus on manual signals (hand gestures) and tend to
overlook non-manual cues like mouthing. In fact, mouthing conveys essential
linguistic information in sign languages and plays a crucial role in
disambiguating visually similar signs. In this paper, we propose SignClip, a
novel framework to improve the accuracy of sign language translation. It fuses
manual and non-manual cues, specifically spatial gesture and lip movement
features. Besides, SignClip introduces a hierarchical contrastive learning
framework with multi-level alignment objectives, ensuring semantic consistency
across sign-lip and visual-text modalities. Extensive experiments on two
benchmark datasets, PHOENIX14T and How2Sign, demonstrate the superiority of our
approach. For example, on PHOENIX14T, in the Gloss-free setting, SignClip
surpasses the previous state-of-the-art model SpaMo, improving BLEU-4 from
24.32 to 24.71, and ROUGE from 46.57 to 48.38.

Method: 在多个文本粘贴数据集上测试闭源和开源VLMs，包括实际场景文本和假悬身份证粘贴的具体应用场景。

Result: 开源模型表现推近但仍落后于GPT-4o等闭源模型；专门为图像粘贴检测设计的VLMs在文本粘贴任务上普遍存在一般化问题。

Conclusion: 开源VLMs在文本粘贴检测方面取得进步，但仍需要继续攻克实际应用中的挑战，特别是在复杂场景下的一般化性能。

Abstract: Recent works have shown the effectiveness of Large Vision Language Models
(VLMs or LVLMs) in image manipulation detection. However, text manipulation
detection is largely missing in these studies. We bridge this knowledge gap by
analyzing closed- and open-source VLMs on different text manipulation datasets.
Our results suggest that open-source models are getting closer, but still
behind closed-source ones like GPT- 4o. Additionally, we benchmark image
manipulation detection-specific VLMs for text manipulation detection and show
that they suffer from the generalization problem. We benchmark VLMs for
manipulations done on in-the-wild scene texts and on fantasy ID cards, where
the latter mimic a challenging real-world misuse.

Result: 大量实验证明MCL-AD框架在零样本3D异常检测中达到了最先进的性能

Conclusion: 通过多模态协作学习，MCL-AD框架能够有效利用不同模态的互补信息，显著提升零样本3D异常检测的效果

Abstract: Zero-shot 3D (ZS-3D) anomaly detection aims to identify defects in 3D objects
without relying on labeled training data, making it especially valuable in
scenarios constrained by data scarcity, privacy, or high annotation cost.
However, most existing methods focus exclusively on point clouds, neglecting
the rich semantic cues available from complementary modalities such as RGB
images and texts priors. This paper introduces MCL-AD, a novel framework that
leverages multimodal collaboration learning across point clouds, RGB images,
and texts semantics to achieve superior zero-shot 3D anomaly detection.
Specifically, we propose a Multimodal Prompt Learning Mechanism (MPLM) that
enhances the intra-modal representation capability and inter-modal
collaborative learning by introducing an object-agnostic decoupled text prompt
and a multimodal contrastive loss. In addition, a collaborative modulation
mechanism (CMM) is proposed to fully leverage the complementary representations
of point clouds and RGB images by jointly modulating the RGB image-guided and
point cloud-guided branches. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the
proposed MCL-AD framework achieves state-of-the-art performance in ZS-3D
anomaly detection.

Method: Lipschitz引导的随机深度(DropPath)方法，drop概率随深度增加以控制网络有效Lipschitz常数，对深层进行正则化

Result: 在CIFAR-10和ViT-Tiny上的实验表明，该方法保持接近基线的干净精度，提升了对FGSM、PGD-20和AutoAttack的鲁棒性，并显著减少了FLOPs

Conclusion: 深度相关的DropPath调度是一种有效的正则化方法，能够同时提高模型鲁棒性、保持精度并降低计算成本

Abstract: Deep neural networks and Vision Transformers achieve state-of-the-art
performance in computer vision but are highly vulnerable to adversarial
perturbations. Standard defenses often incur high computational cost or lack
formal guarantees. We propose a Lipschitz-guided stochastic depth (DropPath)
method, where drop probabilities increase with depth to control the effective
Lipschitz constant of the network. This approach regularizes deeper layers,
improving robustness while preserving clean accuracy and reducing computation.
Experiments on CIFAR-10 with ViT-Tiny show that our custom depth-dependent
schedule maintains near-baseline clean accuracy, enhances robustness under
FGSM, PGD-20, and AutoAttack, and significantly reduces FLOPs compared to
baseline and linear DropPath schedules.

Abstract: In this paper we address the problem of precise geolocation of street
furniture in complex urban environments, which is a critical task for effective
monitoring and maintenance of public infrastructure by local authorities and
private stakeholders. To this end, we propose a probabilistic framework based
on energy maps that encode the spatial likelihood of object locations.
Representing the energy in a map-based geopositioned format allows the
optimisation process to seamlessly integrate external geospatial information,
such as GIS layers, road maps, or placement constraints, which improves
contextual awareness and localisation accuracy. A stochastic birth-and-death
optimisation algorithm is introduced to infer the most probable configuration
of assets. We evaluate our approach using a realistic simulation informed by a
geolocated dataset of street lighting infrastructure in Dublin city centre,
demonstrating its potential for scalable and accurate urban asset mapping. The
implementation of the algorithm will be made available in the GitHub repository

Motivation: 扩散变换器计算成本高，现有特征缓存方法只利用时间维度相似性，忽略了空间维度的相似性

Method: 在每个时间步对token进行空间聚类，每个聚类只计算一个token并将其信息传播给其他token，减少90%以上token数量

Result: 在DiT、FLUX和HunyuanVideo上验证有效，FLUX加速4.96倍且ImageReward达到99.49%，超过原模型0.51%

Conclusion: ClusCa是正交且互补的特征缓存方法，无需训练即可直接应用于任何扩散变换器，显著加速推理过程

Abstract: Diffusion transformers have gained significant attention in recent years for
their ability to generate high-quality images and videos, yet still suffer from
a huge computational cost due to their iterative denoising process. Recently,
feature caching has been introduced to accelerate diffusion transformers by
caching the feature computation in previous timesteps and reusing it in the
following timesteps, which leverage the temporal similarity of diffusion models
while ignoring the similarity in the spatial dimension. In this paper, we
introduce Cluster-Driven Feature Caching (ClusCa) as an orthogonal and
complementary perspective for previous feature caching. Specifically, ClusCa
performs spatial clustering on tokens in each timestep, computes only one token
in each cluster and propagates their information to all the other tokens, which
is able to reduce the number of tokens by over 90%. Extensive experiments on
DiT, FLUX and HunyuanVideo demonstrate its effectiveness in both text-to-image
and text-to-video generation. Besides, it can be directly applied to any
diffusion transformer without requirements for training. For instance, ClusCa
achieves 4.96x acceleration on FLUX with an ImageReward of 99.49%, surpassing
the original model by 0.51%. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformers在语义分割中表现优异，但在资源受限设备上部署受限，量化是提高效率的有效策略，但ViT分割模型在低精度下表现脆弱。

Method: 基于Segmenter架构，系统替换浮点运算为整数运算；提出λ-ShiftGELU激活函数处理长尾分布；移除L2归一化层；用最近邻上采样替换双线性插值。

Result: 在FP32基线5.1%的平均精度损失内，模型大小减少3.8倍，推理速度提升1.2倍；单样本PTQ也能获得有竞争力的精度。

Conclusion: I-Segmenter为ViT分割模型的现实部署提供了实用的整数化解决方案，在效率和精度间取得了良好平衡。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have recently achieved strong results in semantic
segmentation, yet their deployment on resource-constrained devices remains
limited due to their high memory footprint and computational cost. Quantization
offers an effective strategy to improve efficiency, but ViT-based segmentation
models are notoriously fragile under low precision, as quantization errors
accumulate across deep encoder-decoder pipelines. We introduce I-Segmenter, the
first fully integer-only ViT segmentation framework. Building on the Segmenter
architecture, I-Segmenter systematically replaces floating-point operations
with integer-only counterparts. To further stabilize both training and
inference, we propose $\lambda$-ShiftGELU, a novel activation function that
mitigates the limitations of uniform quantization in handling long-tailed
activation distributions. In addition, we remove the L2 normalization layer and
replace bilinear interpolation in the decoder with nearest neighbor upsampling,
ensuring integer-only execution throughout the computational graph. Extensive
experiments show that I-Segmenter achieves accuracy within a reasonable margin
of its FP32 baseline (5.1 % on average), while reducing model size by up to
3.8x and enabling up to 1.2x faster inference with optimized runtimes. Notably,
even in one-shot PTQ with a single calibration image, I-Segmenter delivers
competitive accuracy, underscoring its practicality for real-world deployment.

TL;DR: GARD是一种基于伽马扩散模型的OCT图像去噪方法，通过噪声减少保真度项和加速推理框架，在保持解剖结构的同时有效去除散斑噪声


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: OCT图像存在固有的散斑噪声，传统去噪方法难以平衡噪声去除与解剖结构保留的需求，需要更准确的噪声统计建模和更好的去噪效果

Method: 提出GARD方法：使用Denoising Diffusion Gamma Model替代传统高斯噪声假设，引入Noise-Reduced Fidelity Term指导去噪过程，采用Denoising Diffusion Implicit Model框架加速推理

Result: 在配对噪声和低噪声OCT B扫描数据集上，GARD在PSNR、SSIM和MSE指标上显著优于传统方法和最先进的深度学习模型，定性结果显示边缘更清晰、解剖细节保留更好

Conclusion: GARD通过伽马扩散模型和噪声减少保真度项，有效解决了OCT图像去噪中噪声去除与结构保留的平衡问题，为医学图像处理提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) is a vital imaging modality for diagnosing
and monitoring retinal diseases. However, OCT images are inherently degraded by
speckle noise, which obscures fine details and hinders accurate interpretation.
While numerous denoising methods exist, many struggle to balance noise
reduction with the preservation of crucial anatomical structures. This paper
introduces GARD (Gamma-based Anatomical Restoration and Denoising), a novel
deep learning approach for OCT image despeckling that leverages the strengths
of diffusion probabilistic models. Unlike conventional diffusion models that
assume Gaussian noise, GARD employs a Denoising Diffusion Gamma Model to more
accurately reflect the statistical properties of speckle. Furthermore, we
introduce a Noise-Reduced Fidelity Term that utilizes a pre-processed,
less-noisy image to guide the denoising process. This crucial addition prevents
the reintroduction of high-frequency noise. We accelerate the inference process
by adapting the Denoising Diffusion Implicit Model framework to our Gamma-based
model. Experiments on a dataset with paired noisy and less-noisy OCT B-scans
demonstrate that GARD significantly outperforms traditional denoising methods
and state-of-the-art deep learning models in terms of PSNR, SSIM, and MSE.
Qualitative results confirm that GARD produces sharper edges and better

Abstract: Mammography screening is an essential tool for early detection of breast
cancer. The speed and accuracy of mammography interpretation have the potential
to be improved with deep learning methods. However, the development of a
foundation visual language model (VLM) is hindered by limited data and domain
differences between natural and medical images. Existing mammography VLMs,
adapted from natural images, often ignore domain-specific characteristics, such
as multi-view relationships in mammography. Unlike radiologists who analyze
both views together to process ipsilateral correspondence, current methods
treat them as independent images or do not properly model the multi-view
correspondence learning, losing critical geometric context and resulting in
suboptimal prediction. We propose GLAM: Global and Local Alignment for
Multi-view mammography for VLM pretraining using geometry guidance. By
leveraging the prior knowledge about the multi-view imaging process of
mammograms, our model learns local cross-view alignments and fine-grained local
features through joint global and local, visual-visual, and visual-language
contrastive learning. Pretrained on EMBED [14], one of the largest open
mammography datasets, our model outperforms baselines across multiple datasets
under different settings.

Abstract: Visual grounding refers to the ability of a model to identify a region within
some visual input that matches a textual description. Consequently, a model
equipped with visual grounding capabilities can target a wide range of
applications in various domains, including referring expression comprehension,
answering questions pertinent to fine-grained details in images or videos,
caption visual context by explicitly referring to entities, as well as low and
high-level control in simulated and real environments. In this survey paper, we
review representative works across the key areas of research on modern
general-purpose vision language models (VLMs). We first outline the importance
of grounding in VLMs, then delineate the core components of the contemporary
paradigm for developing grounded models, and examine their practical
applications, including benchmarks and evaluation metrics for grounded
multimodal generation. We also discuss the multifaceted interrelations among
visual grounding, multimodal chain-of-thought, and reasoning in VLMs. Finally,
we analyse the challenges inherent to visual grounding and suggest promising
directions for future research.

Motivation: 文本基于图像编辑方法容易受到对扫攻击，需要一种新的攻击方法来打破文本提示与图像表征之间的对齐关系

Method: 使用源图像的自动生成标题作为编辑提示的代理，通过Attention Attack干扰文本提示与图像表征之间的跨注意力机制

Conclusion: Attention Attack作为一种新的视觉组件攻击方法，能够有效破坏文本基于图像编辑系统的性能，为安全性评估提供了新的视角和评测方法

Abstract: Recent advances in text-based image editing have enabled fine-grained
manipulation of visual content guided by natural language. However, such
methods are susceptible to adversarial attacks. In this work, we propose a
novel attack that targets the visual component of editing methods. We introduce
Attention Attack, which disrupts the cross-attention between a textual prompt
and the visual representation of the image by using an automatically generated
caption of the source image as a proxy for the edit prompt. This breaks the
alignment between the contents of the image and their textual description,
without requiring knowledge of the editing method or the editing prompt.
Reflecting on the reliability of existing metrics for immunization success, we
propose two novel evaluation strategies: Caption Similarity, which quantifies
semantic consistency between original and adversarial edits, and semantic
Intersection over Union (IoU), which measures spatial layout disruption via
segmentation masks. Experiments conducted on the TEDBench++ benchmark
demonstrate that our attack significantly degrades editing performance while
remaining imperceptible.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然基于深度学习的图像压缩方法在性能上优于传统编解码器，但计算资源需求过高，限制了其在资源受限平台上的实时应用部署

Method: 采用知识蒸馏训练范式，让小规模神经网络通过部分学习大型复杂模型的输出，实现在图像压缩任务中的性能提升和资源节省

Conclusion: 知识蒸馏为神经网络图像压缩的资源优化提供了有效途径，未来可探索不同教师模型、替代损失函数以及扩展到基于Transformer的模型

Abstract: Learned image compression sits at the intersection of machine learning and
image processing. With advances in deep learning, neural network-based
compression methods have emerged. In this process, an encoder maps the image to
a low-dimensional latent space, which is then quantized, entropy-coded into a
binary bitstream, and transmitted to the receiver. At the receiver end, the
bitstream is entropy-decoded, and a decoder reconstructs an approximation of
the original image. Recent research suggests that these models consistently
outperform conventional codecs. However, they require significant processing
power, making them unsuitable for real-time use on resource-constrained
platforms, which hinders their deployment in mainstream applications. This
study aims to reduce the resource requirements of neural networks used for
image compression by leveraging knowledge distillation, a training paradigm
where smaller neural networks, partially trained on the outputs of larger, more
complex models, can achieve better performance than when trained independently.
Our work demonstrates that knowledge distillation can be effectively applied to
image compression tasks: i) across various architecture sizes, ii) to achieve
different image quality/bit rate tradeoffs, and iii) to save processing and
energy resources. This approach introduces new settings and hyperparameters,
and future research could explore the impact of different teacher models, as
well as alternative loss functions. Knowledge distillation could also be
extended to transformer-based models. The code is publicly available at:

Conclusion: 该方法为获取真实世界序数监督提供了一条可扩展的路径，这是之前通过手动标注无法实现的，展示了在室外场景本征图像分解方面的优越性能。

Abstract: Decomposing an image into its intrinsic photometric factors--shading and
reflectance--is a long-standing challenge due to the lack of extensive
ground-truth data for real-world scenes. Recent methods rely on synthetic data
or sparse annotations for limited indoor and even fewer outdoor scenes. We
introduce a novel training-free approach for intrinsic image decomposition
using only a pair of visible and thermal images. We leverage the principle that
light not reflected from an opaque surface is absorbed and detected as heat by
a thermal camera. This allows us to relate the ordinalities between visible and
thermal image intensities to the ordinalities of shading and reflectance, which
can densely self-supervise an optimizing neural network to recover shading and
reflectance. We perform quantitative evaluations with known reflectance and
shading under natural and artificial lighting, and qualitative experiments
across diverse outdoor scenes. The results demonstrate superior performance
over recent learning-based models and point toward a scalable path to curating
real-world ordinal supervision, previously infeasible via manual labeling.

Abstract: Compressed video quality enhancement (CVQE) is crucial for improving user
experience with lossy video codecs like H.264/AVC, H.265/HEVC, and H.266/VVC.
While deep learning based CVQE has driven significant progress, existing
surveys still suffer from limitations: lack of systematic classification
linking methods to specific standards and artifacts, insufficient comparative
analysis of architectural paradigms across coding types, and underdeveloped
benchmarking practices. To address these gaps, this paper presents three key
contributions. First, it introduces a novel taxonomy classifying CVQE methods
across architectural paradigms, coding standards, and compressed-domain feature
utilization. Second, it proposes a unified benchmarking framework integrating
modern compression protocols and standard test sequences for fair
multi-criteria evaluation. Third, it provides a systematic analysis of the
critical trade-offs between reconstruction performance and computational
complexity observed in state-of-the-art methods and highlighting promising
directions for future research. This comprehensive review aims to establish a
foundation for consistent assessment and informed model selection in CVQE
research and deployment.

TL;DR: MM SAM-adapter是一个新颖的多模态语义分割框架，通过适配器网络将融合的多模态特征注入到Segment Anything Model中，在保持RGB特征强泛化能力的同时，有选择地利用辅助模态信息，在多个挑战性基准测试中实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语义分割方法在恶劣光照、遮挡和恶劣天气等挑战性条件下表现不佳，需要整合辅助传感器数据（如LiDAR、红外）来提供互补信息，增强模型的鲁棒性。

Method: 提出MM SAM-adapter框架，使用适配器网络将融合的多模态特征注入到SAM的RGB特征中，既能保持RGB特征的强泛化能力，又能有选择地利用辅助模态提供的额外线索。

Result: 在DeLiVER、FMB和MUSES三个挑战性基准测试中实现了最先进的性能。在RGB-easy和RGB-hard子集上的结果一致表明，该框架在有利和不利条件下都优于竞争方法。

Conclusion: 多模态适配方法能够实现平衡且高效的多模态信息利用，为鲁棒的场景理解提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation, a key task in computer vision with broad applications
in autonomous driving, medical imaging, and robotics, has advanced
substantially with deep learning. Nevertheless, current approaches remain
vulnerable to challenging conditions such as poor lighting, occlusions, and
adverse weather. To address these limitations, multimodal methods that
integrate auxiliary sensor data (e.g., LiDAR, infrared) have recently emerged,
providing complementary information that enhances robustness. In this work, we
present MM SAM-adapter, a novel framework that extends the capabilities of the
Segment Anything Model (SAM) for multimodal semantic segmentation. The proposed
method employs an adapter network that injects fused multimodal features into
SAM's rich RGB features. This design enables the model to retain the strong
generalization ability of RGB features while selectively incorporating
auxiliary modalities only when they contribute additional cues. As a result, MM
SAM-adapter achieves a balanced and efficient use of multimodal information. We
evaluate our approach on three challenging benchmarks, DeLiVER, FMB, and MUSES,
where MM SAM-adapter delivers state-of-the-art performance. To further analyze
modality contributions, we partition DeLiVER and FMB into RGB-easy and RGB-hard
subsets. Results consistently demonstrate that our framework outperforms
competing methods in both favorable and adverse conditions, highlighting the
effectiveness of multimodal adaptation for robust scene understanding. The code

Motivation: 解决当前扩散模型随分辨率增加计算需求呈二次增长的问题，实现跨设备的任意分辨率图像生成，为生产者和消费者提供一致的视觉体验。

Method: 基于潜在扩散模型的第二代方法，将扩散模型生成的固定潜在表示作为内容表示，使用一步生成器解码任意分辨率图像，用新的生成器替换VAE解码器。

Result: InfGen能够将许多模型提升到任意高分辨率时代，同时将4K图像生成时间从超过100秒减少到10秒以内。

Conclusion: 该方法简化了过程，降低了计算复杂度，可应用于任何使用相同潜在空间的模型，实现了高效的高分辨率图像生成。

Abstract: Arbitrary resolution image generation provides a consistent visual experience
across devices, having extensive applications for producers and consumers.
Current diffusion models increase computational demand quadratically with
resolution, causing 4K image generation delays over 100 seconds. To solve this,
we explore the second generation upon the latent diffusion models, where the
fixed latent generated by diffusion models is regarded as the content
representation and we propose to decode arbitrary resolution images with a
compact generated latent using a one-step generator. Thus, we present the
\textbf{InfGen}, replacing the VAE decoder with the new generator, for
generating images at any resolution from a fixed-size latent without retraining
the diffusion models, which simplifies the process, reducing computational
complexity and can be applied to any model using the same latent space.
Experiments show InfGen is capable of improving many models into the arbitrary
high-resolution era while cutting 4K image generation time to under 10 seconds.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease is a progressive, neurodegenerative disorder that causes
memory loss and cognitive decline. While there has been extensive research in
applying deep learning models to Alzheimer's prediction tasks, these models
remain limited by lack of available labeled data, poor generalization across
datasets, and inflexibility to varying numbers of input scans and time
intervals between scans. In this study, we adapt three state-of-the-art
temporal self-supervised learning (SSL) approaches for 3D brain MRI analysis,
and add novel extensions designed to handle variable-length inputs and learn
robust spatial features. We aggregate four publicly available datasets
comprising 3,161 patients for pre-training, and show the performance of our
model across multiple Alzheimer's prediction tasks including diagnosis
classification, conversion detection, and future conversion prediction.
Importantly, our SSL model implemented with temporal order prediction and
contrastive learning outperforms supervised learning on six out of seven
downstream tasks. It demonstrates adaptability and generalizability across
tasks and number of input images with varying time intervals, highlighting its
capacity for robust performance across clinical applications. We release our
code and model publicly at https://github.com/emilykaczmarek/SSL-AD.

Abstract: We aim to enable humanoid robots to efficiently solve new manipulation tasks
from a few video examples. In-context learning (ICL) is a promising framework
for achieving this goal due to its test-time data efficiency and rapid
adaptability. However, current ICL methods rely on labor-intensive teleoperated
data for training, which restricts scalability. We propose using human play
videos -- continuous, unlabeled videos of people interacting freely with their
environment -- as a scalable and diverse training data source. We introduce
MimicDroid, which enables humanoids to perform ICL using human play videos as
the only training data. MimicDroid extracts trajectory pairs with similar
manipulation behaviors and trains the policy to predict the actions of one
trajectory conditioned on the other. Through this process, the model acquired
ICL capabilities for adapting to novel objects and environments at test time.
To bridge the embodiment gap, MimicDroid first retargets human wrist poses
estimated from RGB videos to the humanoid, leveraging kinematic similarity. It
also applies random patch masking during training to reduce overfitting to
human-specific cues and improve robustness to visual differences. To evaluate
few-shot learning for humanoids, we introduce an open-source simulation
benchmark with increasing levels of generalization difficulty. MimicDroid
outperformed state-of-the-art methods and achieved nearly twofold higher
success rates in the real world. Additional materials can be found on:

Abstract: Infancy is characterized by rapid body growth and an explosive change of
sensory and motor abilities. However, developmental robots and simulation
platforms are typically designed in the image of a specific age, which limits
their ability to capture the changing abilities and constraints of developing

strength covering the age range from birth to 24 months. It also features
foveated vision with developing visual acuity as well as sensorimotor delays
modeling finite signal transmission speeds to and from an infant's brain.
Further enhancements of this MIMo version include an inverse kinematics module,
a random environment generator and updated compatiblity with third-party
simulation and learning libraries. Overall, this new MIMo version permits
increased realism when modeling various aspects of sensorimotor development.

<details>

Motivation: 社交机器人在公共和辅助环境中应用日益增多，但对耳机用户的可访问性研究不足，需要探索机器人使用手语进行沟通的可行性

Method: 与耳机学生和LIS专家合作，使用手动动画技术和MATLAB逆动力学求解器在Pepper机器人上实现52个LIS手语，并对12名LIS熟练者进行视频基础的识别测试

Result: 大部分单独手语能够正确识别，但完整句子识别率显著低于单独手语，主要因为Pepper的关节灵活性和时间约束有限

Conclusion: 商用社交机器人可以进行部分LIS手语的可识别演示，为更包容性的交互设计提供机会，未来需要多模态增强和深度参与式设计来改善机器人表达能力

Abstract: Social robots are increasingly experimented in public and assistive settings,
but their accessibility for Deaf users remains quite underexplored. Italian
Sign Language (LIS) is a fully-fledged natural language that relies on complex
manual and non-manual components. Enabling robots to communicate using LIS
could foster more inclusive human robot interaction, especially in social
environments such as hospitals, airports, or educational settings. This study
investigates whether a commercial social robot, Pepper, can produce
intelligible LIS signs and short signed LIS sentences. With the help of a Deaf
student and his interpreter, an expert in LIS, we co-designed and implemented
52 LIS signs on Pepper using either manual animation techniques or a MATLAB
based inverse kinematics solver. We conducted a exploratory user study
involving 12 participants proficient in LIS, both Deaf and hearing.
Participants completed a questionnaire featuring 15 single-choice video-based
sign recognition tasks and 2 open-ended questions on short signed sentences.
Results shows that the majority of isolated signs were recognized correctly,
although full sentence recognition was significantly lower due to Pepper's
limited articulation and temporal constraints. Our findings demonstrate that
even commercially available social robots like Pepper can perform a subset of
LIS signs intelligibly, offering some opportunities for a more inclusive
interaction design. Future developments should address multi-modal enhancements
(e.g., screen-based support or expressive avatars) and involve Deaf users in
participatory design to refine robot expressivity and usability.

Motivation: 标准模仿学习方法需要大量演示数据或随机探索，存在安全性差、碰撞频繁、需要人工重置环境等问题，特别是在间隙受限任务中

Method: 两阶段框架：1）单次人类教学，提供一次演示并标注关键路径点的精度边界；2）机器人自主增强，在边界内生成多样化无碰撞轨迹并与原始演示重新连接

Result: 在仿真和真实世界操作任务中，SART相比仅使用人类收集演示训练的策略获得了显著更高的成功率

Conclusion: SART通过最小化人工干预同时确保安全性，有效提高了数据收集效率，为模仿学习提供了一种高效安全的新范式

Abstract: Imitation learning is a promising paradigm for training robot agents;
however, standard approaches typically require substantial data acquisition --
via numerous demonstrations or random exploration -- to ensure reliable
performance. Although exploration reduces human effort, it lacks safety
guarantees and often results in frequent collisions -- particularly in
clearance-limited tasks (e.g., peg-in-hole) -- thereby, necessitating manual
environmental resets and imposing additional human burden. This study proposes
Self-Augmented Robot Trajectory (SART), a framework that enables policy
learning from a single human demonstration, while safely expanding the dataset
through autonomous augmentation. SART consists of two stages: (1) human
teaching only once, where a single demonstration is provided and precision
boundaries -- represented as spheres around key waypoints -- are annotated,
followed by one environment reset; (2) robot self-augmentation, where the robot
generates diverse, collision-free trajectories within these boundaries and
reconnects to the original demonstration. This design improves the data
collection efficiency by minimizing human effort while ensuring safety.
Extensive evaluations in simulation and real-world manipulation tasks show that
SART achieves substantially higher success rates than policies trained solely
on human-collected demonstrations. Video results available at

Abstract: Ensuring the safe and reliable operation of robotic systems is paramount to
prevent potential disasters and safeguard human well-being. Despite rigorous
design and engineering practices, these systems can still experience
malfunctions, leading to safety risks. In this study, we present a machine
learning-based approach for detecting anomalies in system logs to enhance the
safety and reliability of robotic systems. We collected logs from two distinct

(Context 1) and a Pioneer robot context (Context 2). Results showed that while
LR demonstrated superior performance in Context 1, the Autoencoder model proved
to be the most effective in Context 2. This highlights that the optimal model
choice is context-dependent, likely due to the varying complexity of anomalies
across different robotic platforms. This research underscores the value of a

Motivation: 软体机器人结构设计需要选择影响性能和稳健性的参数，但传统方法包括硬件迭代（耗时）或简化模型（不能处理复杂任务）

Method: 提出一种基于动态模拟的设计工具，能够考虑接触和摩擦模型，以任务成功率等任务级目标优化缺口指的程度参数

Conclusion: 缺口指的程度影响容对窗口，但优化结果具有任务特异性，需要能够考虑具体应用场景几何和动力学的设计工具

Abstract: Mechanical compliance is a key design parameter for dynamic contact-rich
manipulation, affecting task success and safety robustness over contact
geometry variation. Design of soft robotic structures, such as compliant
fingers, requires choosing design parameters which affect geometry and
stiffness, and therefore manipulation performance and robustness. Today, these
parameters are chosen through either hardware iteration, which takes
significant development time, or simplified models (e.g. planar), which can't
address complex manipulation task objectives. Improvements in dynamic
simulation, especially with contact and friction modeling, present a potential
design tool for mechanical compliance. We propose a simulation-based design
tool for compliant mechanisms which allows design with respect to task-level
objectives, such as success rate. This is applied to optimize design parameters
of a structured compliant finger to reduce failure cases inside a tolerance
window in insertion tasks. The improvement in robustness is then validated on a
real robot using tasks from the benchmark NIST task board. The finger stiffness
affects the tolerance window: optimized parameters can increase tolerable
ranges by a factor of 2.29, with workpiece variation up to 8.6 mm being
compensated. However, the trends remain task-specific. In some tasks, the
highest stiffness yields the widest tolerable range, whereas in others the
opposite is observed, motivating need for design tools which can consider
application-specific geometry and dynamics.

Conclusion: 球形机器人的高动态运动特性对当前LIO算法构成重大挑战，需要发展更加适应球形运动特性的新型定位咃映射算法

Abstract: Spherical robots offer unique advantages for mapping applications in
hazardous or confined environments, thanks to their protective shells and
omnidirectional mobility. This work presents two complementary spherical
mapping systems: a lightweight, non-actuated design and an actuated variant
featuring internal pendulum-driven locomotion. Both systems are equipped with a
Livox Mid-360 solid-state LiDAR sensor and run LiDAR-Inertial Odometry (LIO)
algorithms on resource-constrained hardware. We assess the mapping accuracy of
these systems by comparing the resulting 3D point-clouds from the LIO
algorithms to a ground truth map. The results indicate that the performance of
state-of-the-art LIO algorithms deteriorates due to the high dynamic movement
introduced by the spherical locomotion, leading to globally inconsistent maps
and sometimes unrecoverable drift.

Abstract: Robot skill acquisition processes driven by reinforcement learning often rely
on simulations to efficiently generate large-scale interaction data. However,
the absence of simulation models for tactile sensors has hindered the use of
tactile sensing in such skill learning processes, limiting the development of
effective policies driven by tactile perception. To bridge this gap, we present
TwinTac, a system that combines the design of a physical tactile sensor with
its digital twin model. Our hardware sensor is designed for high sensitivity
and a wide measurement range, enabling high quality sensing data essential for
object interaction tasks. Building upon the hardware sensor, we develop the
digital twin model using a real-to-sim approach. This involves collecting
synchronized cross-domain data, including finite element method results and the
physical sensor's outputs, and then training neural networks to map simulated
data to real sensor responses. Through experimental evaluation, we
characterized the sensitivity of the physical sensor and demonstrated the
consistency of the digital twin in replicating the physical sensor's output.
Furthermore, by conducting an object classification task, we showed that
simulation data generated by our digital twin sensor can effectively augment
real-world data, leading to improved accuracy. These results highlight
TwinTac's potential to bridge the gap in cross-domain learning tasks.

Abstract: This paper studies the kinematic tracking control problem for aerial
manipulators. Existing kinematic tracking control methods, which typically
employ proportional-derivative feedback or tracking-error-based feedback
strategies, may fail to achieve tracking objectives within specified time
constraints. To address this limitation, we propose a novel control framework
comprising two key components: end-effector tracking control based on a
user-defined preset trajectory and quadratic programming-based reference
allocation. Compared with state-of-the-art approaches, the proposed method has
several attractive features. First, it ensures that the end-effector reaches
the desired position within a preset time while keeping the tracking error
within a performance envelope that reflects task requirements. Second,
quadratic programming is employed to allocate the references of the quadcopter
base and the Delta arm, while considering the physical constraints of the
aerial manipulator, thus preventing solutions that may violate physical
limitations. The proposed approach is validated through three experiments.
Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm
and its capability to guarantee that the target position is reached within the
preset time.

Abstract: The increasing labor shortage and aging population underline the need for
assistive robots to support human care recipients. To enable safe and
responsive assistance, robots require accurate human motion prediction in
physical interaction scenarios. However, this remains a challenging task due to
the variability of assistive settings and the complexity of coupled dynamics in
physical interactions. In this work, we address these challenges through two
key contributions: (1) HHI-Assist, a dataset comprising motion capture clips of
human-human interactions in assistive tasks; and (2) a conditional
Transformer-based denoising diffusion model for predicting the poses of
interacting agents. Our model effectively captures the coupled dynamics between
caregivers and care receivers, demonstrating improvements over baselines and
strong generalization to unseen scenarios. By advancing interaction-aware
motion prediction and introducing a new dataset, our work has the potential to
significantly enhance robotic assistance policies. The dataset and code are

Abstract: Legged robots are promising candidates for exploring challenging areas on
low-gravity bodies such as the Moon, Mars, or asteroids, thanks to their
advanced mobility on unstructured terrain. However, as planetary robots' power
and thermal budgets are highly restricted, these robots need energy-efficient
control approaches that easily transfer to multiple gravity environments. In
this work, we introduce a reinforcement learning-based control approach for
legged robots with gravity-scaled power-optimized reward functions. We use our
approach to develop and validate a locomotion controller and a base pose
controller in gravity environments from lunar gravity (1.62 m/s2) to a
hypothetical super-Earth (19.62 m/s2). Our approach successfully scales across
these gravity levels for locomotion and base pose control with the
gravity-scaled reward functions. The power-optimized locomotion controller
reached a power consumption for locomotion of 23.4 W in Earth gravity on a
15.65 kg robot at 0.4 m/s, a 23 % improvement over the baseline policy.
Additionally, we designed a constant-force spring offload system that allowed
us to conduct real-world experiments on legged locomotion in lunar gravity. In
lunar gravity, the power-optimized control policy reached 12.2 W, 36 % less
than a baseline controller which is not optimized for power efficiency. Our
method provides a scalable approach to developing power-efficient locomotion
controllers for legged robots across multiple gravity levels.

Abstract: In dynamic and uncertain environments, robotic path planning demands accurate
spatiotemporal environment understanding combined with robust decision-making
under partial observability. However, current deep reinforcement learning-based
path planning methods face two fundamental limitations: (1) insufficient
modeling of multi-scale temporal dependencies, resulting in suboptimal
adaptability in dynamic scenarios, and (2) inefficient exploration-exploitation
balance, leading to degraded path quality. To address these challenges, we
propose GundamQ: A Multi-Scale Spatiotemporal Q-Network for Robotic Path
Planning. The framework comprises two key modules: (i) the Spatiotemporal
Perception module, which hierarchically extracts multi-granularity spatial
features and multi-scale temporal dependencies ranging from instantaneous to
extended time horizons, thereby improving perception accuracy in dynamic
environments; and (ii) the Adaptive Policy Optimization module, which balances
exploration and exploitation during training while optimizing for smoothness
and collision probability through constrained policy updates. Experiments in
dynamic environments demonstrate that GundamQ achieves a 15.3\% improvement in
success rate and a 21.7\% increase in overall path quality, significantly
outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: The work describes the development of a hybrid control architecture for an
anthropomorphic tour guide robot, combining a multi-agent resource management
system with automatic behavior scenario generation based on large language
models. The proposed approach aims to overcome the limitations of traditional
systems, which rely on manual tuning of behavior scenarios. These limitations
include manual configuration, low flexibility, and lack of naturalness in robot
behavior. The process of preparing tour scenarios is implemented through a
two-stage generation: first, a stylized narrative is created, then non-verbal
action tags are integrated into the text. The multi-agent system ensures
coordination and conflict resolution during the execution of parallel actions,
as well as maintaining default behavior after the completion of main
operations, contributing to more natural robot behavior. The results obtained
from the trial demonstrate the potential of the proposed approach for
automating and scaling social robot control systems.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with suspended payloads offer significant
advantages for aerial transportation in complex and cluttered environments.
However, existing systems face critical limitations, including unreliable
perception of the cable-payload dynamics, inefficient planning in large-scale
environments, and the inability to guarantee whole-body safety under cable
bending and external disturbances. This paper presents Acetrans, an Autonomous,
Corridor-based, and Efficient UAV suspended transport system that addresses
these challenges through a unified perception, planning, and control framework.
A LiDAR-IMU fusion module is proposed to jointly estimate both payload pose and
cable shape under taut and bent modes, enabling robust whole-body state
estimation and real-time filtering of cable point clouds. To enhance planning
scalability, we introduce the Multi-size-Aware Configuration-space Iterative
Regional Inflation (MACIRI) algorithm, which generates safe flight corridors
while accounting for varying UAV and payload geometries. A spatio-temporal,
corridor-constrained trajectory optimization scheme is then developed to ensure
dynamically feasible and collision-free trajectories. Finally, a nonlinear
model predictive controller (NMPC) augmented with cable-bending constraints
provides robust whole-body safety during execution. Simulation and experimental
results validate the effectiveness of Acetrans, demonstrating substantial
improvements in perception accuracy, planning efficiency, and control safety
compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: 该方法证明了通过简单的视觉任务可以无监督地学习复杂的位姿估计，为机器人视觉感知提供了新的无监督学习范式

Abstract: We introduce a model for monocular RGB relative pose estimation of a ground
robot that trains from scratch without pose labels nor prior knowledge about
the robot's shape or appearance. At training time, we assume: (i) a robot
fitted with multiple LEDs, whose states are independent and known at each
frame; (ii) knowledge of the approximate viewing direction of each LED; and
(iii) availability of a calibration image with a known target distance, to
address the ambiguity of monocular depth estimation. Training data is collected
by a pair of robots moving randomly without needing external infrastructure or
human supervision. Our model trains on the task of predicting from an image the
state of each LED on the robot. In doing so, it learns to predict the position
of the robot in the image, its distance, and its relative bearing. At inference
time, the state of the LEDs is unknown, can be arbitrary, and does not affect
the pose estimation performance. Quantitative experiments indicate that our
approach: is competitive with SoA approaches that require supervision from pose
labels or a CAD model of the robot; generalizes to different domains; and
handles multi-robot pose estimation.

Abstract: We present TASC, a Task-Aware Shared Control framework for teleoperated
manipulation that infers task-level user intent and provides assistance
throughout the task. To support everyday tasks without predefined knowledge,
TASC constructs an open-vocabulary interaction graph from visual input to
represent functional object relationships, and infers user intent accordingly.
A shared control policy then provides rotation assistance during both grasping
and object interaction, guided by spatial constraints predicted by a
vision-language model. Our method addresses two key challenges in
general-purpose, long-horizon shared control: (1) understanding and inferring
task-level user intent, and (2) generalizing assistance across diverse objects
and tasks. Experiments in both simulation and the real world demonstrate that
TASC improves task efficiency and reduces user input effort compared to prior
methods. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first shared control
framework that supports everyday manipulation tasks with zero-shot
generalization. The code that supports our experiments is publicly available at

Abstract: Trajectory prediction is a critical component of autonomous driving,
essential for ensuring both safety and efficiency on the road. However,
traditional approaches often struggle with the scarcity of labeled data and
exhibit suboptimal performance in multi-agent prediction scenarios. To address
these challenges, we introduce a disentangled context-aware pre-training
framework for multi-agent motion prediction, named DECAMP. Unlike existing
methods that entangle representation learning with pretext tasks, our framework
decouples behavior pattern learning from latent feature reconstruction,
prioritizing interpretable dynamics and thereby enhancing scene representation
for downstream prediction. Additionally, our framework incorporates
context-aware representation learning alongside collaborative spatial-motion
pretext tasks, which enables joint optimization of structural and intentional
reasoning while capturing the underlying dynamic intentions. Our experiments on
the Argoverse 2 benchmark showcase the superior performance of our method, and
the results attained underscore its effectiveness in multi-agent motion
forecasting. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first context
autoencoder framework for multi-agent motion forecasting in autonomous driving.
The code and models will be made publicly available.

Method: 设计运动规划层，通过设置期望的角加速度和位置偏差限制来修改给定轨迹，从而减少产生的力矩。使用简化的人体和机器人系统模型进行仿真验证。

Result: 通过仿真验证了该方法在减少力矩方面的性能表现。

Conclusion: 提出的运动规划层能有效减少SRLs操作时产生的力矩，有助于增强人机交互体验。

Abstract: Supernumerary Robotic Limbs (SRLs) can enhance human capability within close
proximity. However, as a wearable device, the generated moment from its
operation acts on the human body as an external torque. When the moments
increase, more muscle units are activated for balancing, and it can result in
reduced muscular null space. Therefore, this paper suggests a concept of a
motion planning layer that reduces the generated moment for enhanced
Human-Robot Interaction. It modifies given trajectories with desirable angular
acceleration and position deviation limits. Its performance to reduce the
moment is demonstrated through the simulation, which uses simplified human and
robotic system models.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种无需训练的视觉-语言导航框架，通过将导航指令分解为显式空间约束并采用图约束优化方法，实现了在连续环境中的零样本适应能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的零样本VLN方法主要适用于离散环境或需要在连续模拟器环境中进行无监督训练，导致在真实场景中的部署和沿用性面临挑战。

Method: 将导航指令分解为显式空间约束，构建空间约束库，将人类指令转换为有向无环图结构，通过约束求解器解决图约束优化问题，使用导航树和回溯机制处理无解或多解情况。

Result: 在标准测试集上实验显示，成功率和导航效率明显提升，远超现有零样本VLN方法。真实世界实验证明框架能够有效沿用到新环境和指令集。

Conclusion: 该框架为建立更稳健和自主的导航系统排除了道路，通过约束驱动的方式实现了在连续环境中的无训练导航能力。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a training-free framework for vision-and-language
navigation (VLN). Existing zero-shot VLN methods are mainly designed for
discrete environments or involve unsupervised training in continuous simulator
environments, which makes it challenging to generalize and deploy them in
real-world scenarios. To achieve a training-free framework in continuous
environments, our framework formulates navigation guidance as graph constraint
optimization by decomposing instructions into explicit spatial constraints. The
constraint-driven paradigm decodes spatial semantics through constraint
solving, enabling zero-shot adaptation to unseen environments. Specifically, we
construct a spatial constraint library covering all types of spatial
relationship mentioned in VLN instructions. The human instruction is decomposed
into a directed acyclic graph, with waypoint nodes, object nodes and edges,
which are used as queries to retrieve the library to build the graph
constraints. The graph constraint optimization is solved by the constraint
solver to determine the positions of waypoints, obtaining the robot's
navigation path and final goal. To handle cases of no solution or multiple
solutions, we construct a navigation tree and the backtracking mechanism.
Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate significant
improvements in success rate and navigation efficiency compared to
state-of-the-art zero-shot VLN methods. We further conduct real-world
experiments to show that our framework can effectively generalize to new
environments and instruction sets, paving the way for a more robust and
autonomous navigation framework.

TL;DR: SAM-BG是一个两阶段的自监督学习框架，通过结构语义保护来学习脑网络表示，在精神病诊断中优于现有方法，特别是在小样本数据场景下。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标记脑网络数据有限，现有自监督学习方法的数据增强策略可能破坏脑图的关键结构语义，需要开发能够保护结构语义的表示学习方法。

Method: 提出两阶段框架：预训练阶段在小标记子集上训练边缘掩码器捕获关键结构语义；自监督学习阶段利用提取的结构先验指导结构感知的数据增强过程。

Result: 在两个真实精神病数据集上的实验表明，SAM-BG优于最先进方法，特别是在小标记数据设置下，并发现了具有临床相关性的连接模式。

Conclusion: SAM-BG通过学习结构语义保护的脑图表示，提高了精神病诊断的准确性和可解释性，为解决脑网络数据分析中的标记数据稀缺问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: The limited availability of labeled brain network data makes it challenging
to achieve accurate and interpretable psychiatric diagnoses. While
self-supervised learning (SSL) offers a promising solution, existing methods
often rely on augmentation strategies that can disrupt crucial structural
semantics in brain graphs. To address this, we propose SAM-BG, a two-stage
framework for learning brain graph representations with structural semantic
preservation. In the pre-training stage, an edge masker is trained on a small
labeled subset to capture key structural semantics. In the SSL stage, the
extracted structural priors guide a structure-aware augmentation process,
enabling the model to learn more semantically meaningful and robust
representations. Experiments on two real-world psychiatric datasets demonstrate
that SAM-BG outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly in small-labeled
data settings, and uncovers clinically relevant connectivity patterns that
enhance interpretability. Our code is available at

*Leen Daher,Zhaobo Wang,Malcolm Mielle*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: D-CAT是一种解耦跨注意力迁移框架，允许在推理时仅使用单一传感器，通过跨模态知识迁移提升性能，解决了多模态分类模型需要配对传感器数据的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有跨模态迁移学习方法在训练和推理时都需要配对的传感器数据，这在资源受限环境中部署困难，因为完整传感器套件在经济和技术上不可行。

Method: 提出D-CAT框架，结合自注意力模块进行特征提取和新型跨注意力对齐损失，在不要求耦合两种模态分类流水线的情况下对齐传感器特征空间。

Result: 在三个多模态人类活动数据集上评估，在分布内场景中从高性能模态迁移可获得10% F1分数提升；在分布外场景中，即使较弱源模态也能改善目标性能。

Conclusion: D-CAT通过实现单传感器推理和跨模态知识迁移，减少了感知系统的硬件冗余，同时保持准确性，对成本敏感或自适应部署至关重要。

Abstract: Cross-modal transfer learning is used to improve multi-modal classification
models (e.g., for human activity recognition in human-robot collaboration).
However, existing methods require paired sensor data at both training and
inference, limiting deployment in resource-constrained environments where full
sensor suites are not economically and technically usable. To address this, we
propose Decoupled Cross-Attention Transfer (D-CAT), a framework that aligns
modality-specific representations without requiring joint sensor modality
during inference. Our approach combines a self-attention module for feature
extraction with a novel cross-attention alignment loss, which enforces the
alignment of sensors' feature spaces without requiring the coupling of the
classification pipelines of both modalities. We evaluate D-CAT on three
multi-modal human activity datasets (IMU, video, and audio) under both
in-distribution and out-of-distribution scenarios, comparing against uni-modal
models. Results show that in in-distribution scenarios, transferring from
high-performing modalities (e.g., video to IMU) yields up to 10% F1-score gains
over uni-modal training. In out-of-distribution scenarios, even weaker source
modalities (e.g., IMU to video) improve target performance, as long as the
target model isn't overfitted on the training data. By enabling single-sensor
inference with cross-modal knowledge, D-CAT reduces hardware redundancy for
perception systems while maintaining accuracy, which is critical for
cost-sensitive or adaptive deployments (e.g., assistive robots in homes with
variable sensor availability). Code is available at

Motivation: 加密货币回报预测极其困难，价格变动由快速变化的链上活动、新闻流和社交情绪驱动，而标记训练数据稀缺且昂贵。

Method: 从基础的指令调优LLM开始，代理在闭环架构中迭代交替扮演三个角色（执行者、评判者和元评判者），利用多模态市场输入和内部偏好反馈，持续改进交易策略和评估标准。

Result: 在多样化市场机制下的实验表明，Meta-RL-Crypto在真实市场的技术指标上表现良好，并优于其他基于LLM的基线方法。

Conclusion: 该架构成功创建了一个完全自我改进的交易代理，能够有效应对加密货币市场的复杂性和数据稀缺问题，展示了在无需人工监督情况下的优异性能。

Abstract: Predicting cryptocurrency returns is notoriously difficult: price movements
are driven by a fast-shifting blend of on-chain activity, news flow, and social
sentiment, while labeled training data are scarce and expensive. In this paper,
we present Meta-RL-Crypto, a unified transformer-based architecture that
unifies meta-learning and reinforcement learning (RL) to create a fully
self-improving trading agent. Starting from a vanilla instruction-tuned LLM,
the agent iteratively alternates between three roles-actor, judge, and
meta-judge-in a closed-loop architecture. This learning process requires no
additional human supervision. It can leverage multimodal market inputs and
internal preference feedback. The agent in the system continuously refines both
the trading policy and evaluation criteria. Experiments across diverse market
regimes demonstrate that Meta-RL-Crypto shows good performance on the technical
indicators of the real market and outperforming other LLM-based baselines.

<details>

Motivation: 现有KV缓存压缩方法大多是启发式的，缺乏动态预算分配机制，无法根据任务需求灵活调整缓存资源。

Method: 提出统一框架最小化残差流信息损失，分析层注意力输出损失，推导跨头比较指标，实现层级和头级的动态预算压缩。

Result: 在LongBench、Needle-In-A-Haystack等多个基准测试中表现优越，无需训练或多策略组合。

Conclusion: LAVa是首个统一的缓存淘汰和动态预算分配策略，动态层预算对生成任务关键，动态头预算对抽取任务重要，在各种任务类型中保持最佳性能。

Abstract: KV Cache is commonly used to accelerate LLM inference with long contexts, yet
its high memory demand drives the need for cache compression. Existing
compression methods, however, are largely heuristic and lack dynamic budget
allocation. To address this limitation, we introduce a unified framework for
cache compression by minimizing information loss in Transformer residual
streams. Building on it, we analyze the layer attention output loss and derive
a new metric to compare cache entries across heads, enabling layer-wise
compression with dynamic head budgets. Additionally, by contrasting cross-layer
information, we also achieve dynamic layer budgets. LAVa is the first unified
strategy for cache eviction and dynamic budget allocation that, unlike prior
methods, does not rely on training or the combination of multiple strategies.
Experiments with benchmarks (LongBench, Needle-In-A-Haystack, Ruler, and
InfiniteBench) demonstrate its superiority. Moreover, our experiments reveal a
new insight: dynamic layer budgets are crucial for generation tasks (e.g., code
completion), while dynamic head budgets play a key role in extraction tasks
(e.g., extractive QA). As a fully dynamic compression method, LAVa consistently
maintains top performance across task types. Our code is available at

Result: 得到强劲的风险识别能力(AUC ~0.81)，检验阈值(τ ~0.038)，保持高安全覆盖率。子群分析显示不同人群组价值存在系统性差异。

Conclusion: 包纳风险阈值技术与离线强化学习无缝集成，能够为人群健康管理团队提供保守且可审计的决策支持。

Abstract: Population health management programs for Medicaid populations coordinate
longitudinal outreach and services (e.g., benefits navigation, behavioral
health, social needs support, and clinical scheduling) and must be safe, fair,
and auditable. We present a Hybrid Adaptive Conformal Offline Reinforcement
Learning (HACO) framework that separates risk calibration from preference
optimization to generate conservative action recommendations at scale. In our
setting, each step involves choosing among common coordination actions (e.g.,
which member to contact, by which modality, and whether to route to a
specialized service) while controlling the near-term risk of adverse
utilization events (e.g., unplanned emergency department visits or
hospitalizations). Using a de-identified operational dataset from Waymark
comprising 2.77 million sequential decisions across 168,126 patients, HACO (i)
trains a lightweight risk model for adverse events, (ii) derives a conformal
threshold to mask unsafe actions at a target risk level, and (iii) learns a
preference policy on the resulting safe subset. We evaluate policies with a
version-agnostic fitted Q evaluation (FQE) on stratified subsets and audit
subgroup performance across age, sex, and race. HACO achieves strong risk
discrimination (AUC ~0.81) with a calibrated threshold ( {\tau} ~0.038 at
{\alpha} = 0.10), while maintaining high safe coverage. Subgroup analyses
reveal systematic differences in estimated value across demographics,
underscoring the importance of fairness auditing. Our results show that
conformal risk gating integrates cleanly with offline RL to deliver
conservative, auditable decision support for population health management
teams.

Abstract: The proliferation of large language models (LLMs) with varying computational
costs and performance profiles presents a critical challenge for scalable,
cost-effective deployment in real-world applications. We introduce a unified
routing framework that leverages a single-head cross-attention mechanism to
jointly model query and model embeddings, enabling dynamic selection of the
optimal LLM for each input query. Our approach is evaluated on RouterBench, a
large-scale, publicly available benchmark encompassing diverse LLM pools and
domains. By explicitly capturing fine-grained query-model interactions, our
router predicts both response quality and generation cost, achieving up to 6.6%
improvement in Average Improvement in Quality (AIQ) and 2.9% in maximum
performance over existing routers. To robustly balance performance and cost, we
propose an exponential reward function that enhances stability across user
preferences. The resulting architecture is lightweight, generalizes effectively
across domains, and demonstrates improved efficiency compared to prior methods,
establishing a new standard for cost-aware LLM routing.

the gradient descent operator or the proximity operator of an explicit

Abstract: Unexpected events can impair attention and delay decision-making, posing
serious safety risks in high-risk environments such as aviation. In particular,
reactions like startle and surprise can impact pilot performance in different
ways, yet are often hard to distinguish in practice. Existing research has
largely studied these reactions separately, with limited focus on their
combined effects or how to differentiate them using physiological data. In this
work, we address this gap by distinguishing between startle and surprise events
based on physiological signals using machine learning and multi-modal fusion
strategies. Our results demonstrate that these events can be reliably
predicted, achieving a highest mean accuracy of 85.7% with SVM and Late Fusion.
To further validate the robustness of our model, we extended the evaluation to
include a baseline condition, successfully differentiating between Startle,
Surprise, and Baseline states with a highest mean accuracy of 74.9% with
XGBoost and Late Fusion.

TL;DR: 本文重新审视了离散动作环境中的actor-critic方法，发现DSAC性能不佳的主要原因是actor和critic熵的耦合。通过解耦这两个组件并引入灵活的off-policy框架，实现了与DQN相当的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 值基方法如DQN是离散动作环境（如Atari）中off-policy强化学习的默认方法。常见的基于策略的方法要么是on-policy且无法有效利用off-policy数据（如PPO），要么在离散动作设置中表现不佳（如SAC）。因此需要重新设计离散动作环境中的actor-critic方法。

Method: 从离散SAC（DSAC）出发，首先确定actor和critic熵的耦合是DSAC性能不佳的主要原因。通过解耦这些组件，引入灵活的off-policy actor-critic框架，允许使用m步Bellman算子进行critic更新，并将标准策略优化方法与熵正则化相结合。

Result: 理论证明在表格设置中可以保证收敛到最优正则化值函数。实证表明这些方法可以在标准Atari游戏中达到DQN的性能水平，甚至在没有熵正则化或显式探索的情况下也能实现。

Conclusion: 通过解耦actor和critic的熵组件，并构建灵活的off-policy框架，成功解决了离散动作环境中actor-critic方法性能不佳的问题，为离散动作RL提供了新的有效解决方案。

Abstract: Value-based approaches such as DQN are the default methods for off-policy
reinforcement learning with discrete-action environments such as Atari. Common
policy-based methods are either on-policy and do not effectively learn from
off-policy data (e.g. PPO), or have poor empirical performance in the
discrete-action setting (e.g. SAC). Consequently, starting from discrete SAC
(DSAC), we revisit the design of actor-critic methods in this setting. First,
we determine that the coupling between the actor and critic entropy is the
primary reason behind the poor performance of DSAC. We demonstrate that by
merely decoupling these components, DSAC can have comparable performance as
DQN. Motivated by this insight, we introduce a flexible off-policy actor-critic
framework that subsumes DSAC as a special case. Our framework allows using an
m-step Bellman operator for the critic update, and enables combining standard
policy optimization methods with entropy regularization to instantiate the
resulting actor objective. Theoretically, we prove that the proposed methods
can guarantee convergence to the optimal regularized value function in the
tabular setting. Empirically, we demonstrate that these methods can approach
the performance of DQN on standard Atari games, and do so even without entropy
regularization or explicit exploration.

Conclusion: HGEN通过有效的集成学习框架成功解决了异构图学习中的挑战，提供了更高的正则化强度并取得了优异的性能

Abstract: This paper presents HGEN that pioneers ensemble learning for heterogeneous
graphs. We argue that the heterogeneity in node types, nodal features, and
local neighborhood topology poses significant challenges for ensemble learning,
particularly in accommodating diverse graph learners. Our HGEN framework
ensembles multiple learners through a meta-path and transformation-based
optimization pipeline to uplift classification accuracy. Specifically, HGEN
uses meta-path combined with random dropping to create Allele Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs), whereby the base graph learners are trained and aligned for
later ensembling. To ensure effective ensemble learning, HGEN presents two key
components: 1) a residual-attention mechanism to calibrate allele GNNs of
different meta-paths, thereby enforcing node embeddings to focus on more
informative graphs to improve base learner accuracy, and 2) a
correlation-regularization term to enlarge the disparity among embedding
matrices generated from different meta-paths, thereby enriching base learner
diversity. We analyze the convergence of HGEN and attest its higher
regularization magnitude over simple voting. Experiments on five heterogeneous
networks validate that HGEN consistently outperforms its state-of-the-art
competitors by substantial margin.

Conclusion: 通过动态计算分配和综合考虑令牌成本与延迟，可以在推理时扩展中获得更优的性能效果，尤其适用于对延迟敏感的应用场景。

Abstract: Inference-time scaling has emerged as a powerful way to improve large
language model (LLM) performance by generating multiple candidate responses and
selecting among them. However, existing work on dynamic allocation for
test-time compute typically considers only parallel generation methods such as
best-of-N, overlooking incremental decoding methods like beam search, and has
largely ignored latency, focusing only on token usage. We formulate
inference-time scaling as a problem of dynamic compute allocation and method
selection, where the system must decide which strategy to apply and how much
compute to allocate on a per-query basis. Our framework explicitly incorporates
both token cost and wall-clock latency, the latter being critical for user
experience and particularly for agentic workflows where models must issue
multiple queries efficiently. Experiments on reasoning benchmarks show that our
approach consistently outperforms static strategies, achieving favorable
accuracy-cost trade-offs while remaining practical for deployment.

Abstract: Much attention has recently been devoted to data-based computing of evolution
of physical systems. In such approaches, information about data points from
past trajectories in phase space is used to reconstruct the equations of motion
and to predict future solutions that have not been observed before. However, in
many cases, the available data does not correspond to the variables that define
the system's phase space. We focus our attention on the important example of
dissipative dynamical systems. In that case, the phase space consists of
coordinates, momenta and entropies; however, the momenta and entropies cannot,
in general, be observed directly. To address this difficulty, we develop an
efficient data-based computing framework based exclusively on observable
variables, by constructing a novel approach based on the \emph{thermodynamic
Lagrangian}, and constructing neural networks that respect the thermodynamics
and guarantees the non-decreasing entropy evolution. We show that our network
can provide an efficient description of phase space evolution based on a
limited number of data points and a relatively small number of parameters in
the system.

Abstract: Long-tailed learning has garnered increasing attention due to its wide
applicability in real-world scenarios. Among existing approaches, Long-Tailed
Semi-Supervised Learning (LTSSL) has emerged as an effective solution by
incorporating a large amount of unlabeled data into the imbalanced labeled
dataset. However, most prior LTSSL methods are designed to train models from
scratch, which often leads to issues such as overconfidence and low-quality
pseudo-labels. To address these challenges, we extend LTSSL into the foundation
model fine-tuning paradigm and propose a novel framework: LoFT (Long-tailed
semi-supervised learning via parameter-efficient Fine-Tuning). We demonstrate
that fine-tuned foundation models can generate more reliable pseudolabels,
thereby benefiting imbalanced learning. Furthermore, we explore a more
practical setting by investigating semi-supervised learning under open-world
conditions, where the unlabeled data may include out-of-distribution (OOD)
samples. To handle this problem, we propose LoFT-OW (LoFT under Open-World
scenarios) to improve the discriminative ability. Experimental results on
multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance
compared to previous approaches, even when utilizing only 1\% of the unlabeled
data compared with previous works.

Conclusion: MP-CSB成功扩展了CSB框架以处理更广泛的组合优化问题，提出的算法在理论和实验性能上都表现出色，为处理非负整数动作空间的组合学习问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In the combinatorial semi-bandit (CSB) problem, a player selects an action
from a combinatorial action set and observes feedback from the base arms
included in the action. While CSB is widely applicable to combinatorial
optimization problems, its restriction to binary decision spaces excludes
important cases involving non-negative integer flows or allocations, such as
the optimal transport and knapsack problems.To overcome this limitation, we
propose the multi-play combinatorial semi-bandit (MP-CSB), where a player can
select a non-negative integer action and observe multiple feedbacks from a
single arm in each round. We propose two algorithms for the MP-CSB. One is a
Thompson-sampling-based algorithm that is computationally feasible even when
the action space is exponentially large with respect to the number of arms, and
attains $O(\log T)$ distribution-dependent regret in the stochastic regime,
where $T$ is the time horizon. The other is a best-of-both-worlds algorithm,
which achieves $O(\log T)$ variance-dependent regret in the stochastic regime
and the worst-case $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\left( \sqrt{T} \right)$ regret in the
adversarial regime. Moreover, its regret in adversarial one is data-dependent,
adapting to the cumulative loss of the optimal action, the total quadratic
variation, and the path-length of the loss sequence. Finally, we numerically
show that the proposed algorithms outperform existing methods in the CSB
literature.

TL;DR: 使用LLM作为科学机器学习代理，通过生成代码而非直接预测来解决ODE问题，并引入新的诊断数据集和基准测试来评估LLM在科学计算任务中的能力


<details>

Motivation: 传统科学机器学习方法在准确性和鲁棒性方面存在挑战，探索使用LLM编写数值算法代码的替代方案，将学习负担从求解函数转移到领域感知的数值选择

Method: 引入两个新数据集：包含误导性问题的诊断数据集和1000个多样化ODE任务的大规模基准测试；评估开源和闭源LLM模型，比较无引导与领域知识引导提示、现成与微调变体的性能

Result: 在提供足够上下文和引导提示的情况下，较新的指令跟随模型在两个评估标准（可执行性和数值有效性）上都达到高准确率；开源系统无需微调即可表现良好，而较旧或较小模型仍能从微调中受益

Conclusion: 精心设计的提示和微调可以产生能够可靠解决简单ODE问题的专用LLM代理，LLM在科学计算任务中展现出作为代码生成代理的潜力

Abstract: Recent work in scientific machine learning aims to tackle scientific tasks
directly by predicting target values with neural networks (e.g.,
physics-informed neural networks, neural ODEs, neural operators, etc.), but
attaining high accuracy and robustness has been challenging. We explore an
alternative view: use LLMs to write code that leverages decades of numerical
algorithms. This shifts the burden from learning a solution function to making
domain-aware numerical choices. We ask whether LLMs can act as SciML agents
that, given a natural-language ODE description, generate runnable code that is
scientifically appropriate, selecting suitable solvers (stiff vs. non-stiff),
and enforcing stability checks. There is currently no benchmark to measure this
kind of capability for scientific computing tasks. As such, we first introduce
two new datasets: a diagnostic dataset of adversarial "misleading" problems;
and a large-scale benchmark of 1,000 diverse ODE tasks. The diagnostic set
contains problems whose superficial appearance suggests stiffness, and that
require algebraic simplification to demonstrate non-stiffness; and the
large-scale benchmark spans stiff and non-stiff ODE regimes. We evaluate open-
and closed-source LLM models along two axes: (i) unguided versus guided
prompting with domain-specific knowledge; and (ii) off-the-shelf versus
fine-tuned variants. Our evaluation measures both executability and numerical
validity against reference solutions. We find that with sufficient context and
guided prompts, newer instruction-following models achieve high accuracy on
both criteria. In many cases, recent open-source systems perform strongly
without fine-tuning, while older or smaller models still benefit from
fine-tuning. Overall, our preliminary results indicate that careful prompting
and fine-tuning can yield a specialized LLM agent capable of reliably solving
simple ODE problems.

TL;DR: DyKen-Hyena模型通过将音频视觉线索转换为动态的逐token卷积核来直接调制文本特征提取，解决了多模态意图识别中模态间信息冲突和噪声问题，在MIntRec基准上取得了SOTA结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态意图识别中，不同模态间可能存在意图无关和冲突信息，传统融合方法可能破坏主要语言特征，需要更细粒度的token级调制而非简单特征融合。

Method: 提出DyKen-Hyena模型，将音频视觉线索转换为动态的逐token卷积核，直接调制文本特征提取过程，实现细粒度的处理调制而非特征融合。

Result: 在MIntRec和MIntRec2.0基准上达到最先进水平，特别是在超出范围检测中获得+10.46%的F1分数提升，证明方法能产生更鲁棒的意图表示。

Conclusion: 通过将问题从特征融合重新定义为处理调制，DyKen-Hyena能够有效利用多模态信息，避免噪声干扰，显著提升多模态意图识别性能。

Abstract: Though Multimodal Intent Recognition (MIR) proves effective by utilizing rich
information from multiple sources (e.g., language, video, and audio), the
potential for intent-irrelevant and conflicting information across modalities
may hinder performance from being further improved. Most current models attempt
to fuse modalities by applying mechanisms like multi-head attention to unimodal
feature sequences and then adding the result back to the original
representation. This process risks corrupting the primary linguistic features
with noisy or irrelevant non-verbal signals, as it often fails to capture the
fine-grained, token-level influence where non-verbal cues should modulate, not
just augment, textual meaning. To address this, we introduce DyKen-Hyena, which
reframes the problem from feature fusion to processing modulation. Our model
translates audio-visual cues into dynamic, per-token convolutional kernels that
directly modulate textual feature extraction. This fine-grained approach
achieves state-of-the-art results on the MIntRec and MIntRec2.0 benchmarks.
Notably, it yields a +10.46% F1-score improvement in out-of-scope detection,
validating that our method creates a fundamentally more robust intent
representation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模Transformer模型在边缘设备上部署时遍历的高计算和通信成本问题，而传统的固定比例压缩方法无法根据输入数据的语义冗余度进行动态调整。

Method: 提出了一种基于每层相似性阈值的自适应标记合并机制，通过多目标优化和贝叶斯优化来寻找准确性、计算成本和通信成本之间的Pareto最优偏影。

Result: 在ImageNet分类任务中，在减少30%浮点运算和不到20%原始通信成本的情况下保持了与原模型相同的准确性；在视觉问答任务中，以不到三分之一的计算量和十分之一的带宽实现了与完整LLaVA模型相竞争的性能。

Conclusion: 该框架为在资源有限的边缘智能场景中部署Transformer模型提供了一种实用而多用途的解决方案，同时具有跨通道条件的稳健性和隐私保护效果。

Abstract: Large-scale transformers are central to modern semantic communication, yet
their high computational and communication costs hinder deployment on
resource-constrained edge devices. This paper introduces a training-free
framework for adaptive token merging, a novel mechanism that compresses
transformer representations at runtime by selectively merging semantically
redundant tokens under per-layer similarity thresholds. Unlike prior
fixed-ratio reduction, our approach couples merging directly to input
redundancy, enabling data-dependent adaptation that balances efficiency and
task relevance without retraining. We cast the discovery of merging strategies
as a multi-objective optimization problem and leverage Bayesian optimization to
obtain Pareto-optimal trade-offs between accuracy, inference cost, and
communication cost. On ImageNet classification, we match the accuracy of the
unmodified transformer with 30\% fewer floating-point operations per second and
under 20\% of the original communication cost, while for visual question
answering our method achieves performance competitive with the full LLaVA model
at less than one-third of the compute and one-tenth of the bandwidth. Finally,
we show that our adaptive merging is robust across varying channel conditions
and provides inherent privacy benefits, substantially degrading the efficacy of
model inversion attacks. Our framework provides a practical and versatile
solution for deploying powerful transformer models in resource-limited edge
intelligence scenarios.

Motivation: 解决现有表格生成方法在领域特定数据库中数据稀缺时的局限性，以及基于提示的LLMs无法有效捕捉特征-标签依赖关系和产生冗余数据的问题

Method: 提出ReFine框架：(i)从可解释模型推导符号"if-then"规则并嵌入提示中，显式指导生成；(ii)应用双重粒度过滤策略抑制过采样模式并选择性精炼稀有样本

Result: 在各种回归和分类基准测试中，ReFine始终优于最先进方法，回归任务R平方绝对提升0.44，分类任务F1分数相对提升10.0%

Conclusion: ReFine通过规则引导和智能过滤有效解决了数据稀缺场景下的表格数据生成问题，为下游应用提供了高质量的合成数据

Abstract: Synthetic tabular data generation is increasingly essential in data
management, supporting downstream applications when real-world and high-quality
tabular data is insufficient. Existing tabular generation approaches, such as
generative adversarial networks (GANs), diffusion models, and fine-tuned Large
Language Models (LLMs), typically require sufficient reference data, limiting
their effectiveness in domain-specific databases with scarce records. While
prompt-based LLMs offer flexibility without parameter tuning, they often fail
to capture dataset-specific feature-label dependencies and generate redundant
data, leading to degradation in downstream task performance. To overcome these
issues, we propose ReFine, a framework that (i) derives symbolic "if-then"
rules from interpretable models and embeds them into prompts to explicitly
guide generation toward domain-specific feature distribution, and (ii) applies
a dual-granularity filtering strategy that suppresses over-sampling patterns
and selectively refines rare but informative samples to reduce distributional
imbalance. Extensive experiments on various regression and classification
benchmarks demonstrate that ReFine consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
methods, achieving up to 0.44 absolute improvement in R-squared for regression
and 10.0 percent relative improvement in F1 score for classification tasks.

Abstract: This paper presents a machine learning-based approach to estimate the energy
consumption of virtual servers without access to physical power measurement
interfaces. Using resource utilization metrics collected from guest virtual
machines, we train a Gradient Boosting Regressor to predict energy consumption
measured via RAPL on the host. We demonstrate, for the first time, guest-only
resource-based energy estimation without privileged host access with
experiments across diverse workloads, achieving high predictive accuracy and
variance explained ($0.90 \leq R^2 \leq 0.97$), indicating the feasibility of
guest-side energy estimation. This approach can enable energy-aware scheduling,
cost optimization and physical host independent energy estimates in virtualized
environments. Our approach addresses a critical gap in virtualized environments
(e.g. cloud) where direct energy measurement is infeasible.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Neural scaling laws--power-law relationships between generalization errors
and characteristics of deep learning models--are vital tools for developing
reliable models while managing limited resources. Although the success of large
language models highlights the importance of these laws, their application to
deep regression models remains largely unexplored. Here, we empirically
investigate neural scaling laws in deep regression using a parameter estimation
model for twisted van der Waals magnets. We observe power-law relationships
between the loss and both training dataset size and model capacity across a
wide range of values, employing various architectures--including fully
connected networks, residual networks, and vision transformers. Furthermore,
the scaling exponents governing these relationships range from 1 to 2, with
specific values depending on the regressed parameters and model details. The
consistent scaling behaviors and their large scaling exponents suggest that the
performance of deep regression models can improve substantially with increasing
data size.

Conclusion: IDEA能够有效估计各种数据集的内在维度并保持高质量重建能力，为复杂科学数据的降维和分析提供了有效工具。

Abstract: This paper introduces the Intrinsic Dimension Estimating Autoencoder (IDEA),
which identifies the underlying intrinsic dimension of a wide range of datasets
whose samples lie on either linear or nonlinear manifolds. Beyond estimating
the intrinsic dimension, IDEA is also able to reconstruct the original dataset
after projecting it onto the corresponding latent space, which is structured
using re-weighted double CancelOut layers. Our key contribution is the
introduction of the projected reconstruction loss term, guiding the training of
the model by continuously assessing the reconstruction quality under the
removal of an additional latent dimension. We first assess the performance of
IDEA on a series of theoretical benchmarks to validate its robustness. These
experiments allow us to test its reconstruction ability and compare its
performance with state-of-the-art intrinsic dimension estimators. The
benchmarks show good accuracy and high versatility of our approach.
Subsequently, we apply our model to data generated from the numerical solution
of a vertically resolved one-dimensional free-surface flow, following a
pointwise discretization of the vertical velocity profile in the horizontal
direction, vertical direction, and time. IDEA succeeds in estimating the
dataset's intrinsic dimension and then reconstructs the original solution by
working directly within the projection space identified by the network.

Abstract: Understanding the internal organization of neural networks remains a
fundamental challenge in deep learning interpretability. We address this
challenge by exploring a novel Sparse Mixture of Experts Variational
Autoencoder (SMoE-VAE) architecture. We test our model on the QuickDraw
dataset, comparing unsupervised expert routing against a supervised baseline
guided by ground-truth labels. Surprisingly, we find that unsupervised routing
consistently achieves superior reconstruction performance. The experts learn to
identify meaningful sub-categorical structures that often transcend
human-defined class boundaries. Through t-SNE visualizations and reconstruction
analysis, we investigate how MoE models uncover fundamental data structures
that are more aligned with the model's objective than predefined labels.
Furthermore, our study on the impact of dataset size provides insights into the
trade-offs between data quantity and expert specialization, offering guidance
for designing efficient MoE architectures.

Conclusion: AODL方法有效解决了多字典稀疏编码的复杂度问题，在合成和真实数据集上展示了优秀的重建和缺失值填补性能

Abstract: Sparse dictionary coding represents signals as linear combinations of a few
dictionary atoms. It has been applied to images, time series, graph signals and
multi-way spatio-temporal data by jointly employing temporal and spatial
dictionaries. Data-agnostic analytical dictionaries, such as the discrete
Fourier transform, wavelets and graph Fourier, have seen wide adoption due to
efficient implementations and good practical performance. On the other hand,
dictionaries learned from data offer sparser and more accurate solutions but
require learning of both the dictionaries and the coding coefficients. This
becomes especially challenging for multi-dictionary scenarios since encoding
coefficients correspond to all atom combinations from the dictionaries. To
address this challenge, we propose a low-rank coding model for 2-dictionary
scenarios and study its data complexity. Namely, we establish a bound on the
number of samples needed to learn dictionaries that generalize to unseen
samples from the same distribution. We propose a convex relaxation solution,
called AODL, whose exact solution we show also solves the original problem. We
then solve this relaxation via alternating optimization between the sparse
coding matrices and the learned dictionaries, which we prove to be convergent.
We demonstrate its quality for data reconstruction and missing value imputation
in both synthetic and real-world datasets. For a fixed reconstruction quality,
AODL learns up to 90\% sparser solutions compared to non-low-rank and
analytical (fixed) dictionary baselines. In addition, the learned dictionaries
reveal interpretable insights into patterns present within the samples used for
training.

Conclusion: 该方法为概率自动机与神经网络的统一提供了严格的代数基础，实现了可解释性、并行化和可微分的模拟

Abstract: We present a formal and constructive theory showing that probabilistic finite
automata (PFAs) can be exactly simulated using symbolic feedforward neural
networks. Our architecture represents state distributions as vectors and
transitions as stochastic matrices, enabling probabilistic state propagation
via matrix-vector products. This yields a parallel, interpretable, and
differentiable simulation of PFA dynamics using soft updates-without
recurrence. We formally characterize probabilistic subset construction,
$\varepsilon$-closure, and exact simulation via layered symbolic computation,
and prove equivalence between PFAs and specific classes of neural networks. We
further show that these symbolic simulators are not only expressive but
learnable: trained with standard gradient descent-based optimization on labeled
sequence data, they recover the exact behavior of ground-truth PFAs. This
learnability, formalized in Proposition 5.1, is the crux of this work. Our
results unify probabilistic automata theory with neural architectures under a
rigorous algebraic framework, bridging the gap between symbolic computation and
deep learning.

Conclusion: FedRP算法有效解决了联邦学习中的隐私保护和通信成本问题，为敏感数据领域的协作学习提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) offers an innovative paradigm for collaborative model
training across decentralized devices, such as smartphones, balancing enhanced
predictive performance with the protection of user privacy in sensitive areas
like Internet of Things (IoT) and medical data analysis. Despite its
advantages, FL encounters significant challenges related to user privacy
protection against potential attacks and the management of communication costs.
This paper introduces a novel federated learning algorithm called FedRP, which
integrates random projection techniques with the Alternating Direction Method
of Multipliers (ADMM) optimization framework. This approach enhances privacy by
employing random projection to reduce the dimensionality of model parameters
prior to their transmission to a central server, reducing the communication
cost. The proposed algorithm offers a strong $(\epsilon, \delta)$-differential
privacy guarantee, demonstrating resilience against data reconstruction
attacks. Experimental results reveal that FedRP not only maintains high model
accuracy but also outperforms existing methods, including conventional
differential privacy approaches and FedADMM, in terms of both privacy
preservation and communication efficiency.

TabPFN and the VBLL-integrated version. Contrary to expectations, we observed
that original TabPFN consistently outperforms VBLL integrated TabPFN in
uncertainty calibration across all datasets.

Abstract: Bayesian Federated Learning (BFL) combines uncertainty modeling with
decentralized training, enabling the development of personalized and reliable
models under data heterogeneity and privacy constraints. Existing approaches
typically rely on Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling or variational
inference, often incorporating personalization mechanisms to better adapt to
local data distributions. In this work, we propose an information-geometric
projection framework for personalization in parametric BFL. By projecting the
global model onto a neighborhood of the user's local model, our method enables
a tunable trade-off between global generalization and local specialization.
Under mild assumptions, we show that this projection step is equivalent to
computing a barycenter on the statistical manifold, allowing us to derive
closed-form solutions and achieve cost-free personalization. We apply the
proposed approach to a variational learning setup using the Improved
Variational Online Newton (IVON) optimizer and extend its application to
general aggregation schemes in BFL. Empirical evaluations under heterogeneous
data distributions confirm that our method effectively balances global and
local performance with minimal computational overhead.

Conclusion: BenchECG通过标准化评估实现了严格比较，xECG为未来ECG基础模型设立了新的性能基准，将加速ECG表示学习的进展

Abstract: Electrocardiograms (ECGs) are inexpensive, widely used, and well-suited to
deep learning. Recently, interest has grown in developing foundation models for
ECGs - models that generalise across diverse downstream tasks. However,
consistent evaluation has been lacking: prior work often uses narrow task
selections and inconsistent datasets, hindering fair comparison. Here, we
introduce BenchECG, a standardised benchmark comprising a comprehensive suite
of publicly available ECG datasets and versatile tasks. We also propose xECG,
an xLSTM-based recurrent model trained with SimDINOv2 self-supervised learning,
which achieves the best BenchECG score compared to publicly available
state-of-the-art models. In particular, xECG is the only publicly available
model to perform strongly on all datasets and tasks. By standardising
evaluation, BenchECG enables rigorous comparison and aims to accelerate
progress in ECG representation learning. xECG achieves superior performance
over earlier approaches, defining a new baseline for future ECG foundation
models.

*Shiwei Li,Qunwei Li,Haozhao Wang,Ruixuan Li,Jianbin Lin,Wenliang Zhong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedBiF是一种新颖的联邦学习框架，通过在本地训练期间直接学习量化模型参数，逐比特更新参数来减少通信开销，同时保持模型精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习虽然能实现分布式协作训练，但存在显著的通信开销问题。现有方法通常在本地训练后进行量化，这会将量化误差引入训练参数中，可能降低模型准确性。

Method: 在每个通信轮次中，服务器首先量化模型参数并传输给客户端。FedBiF允许每个客户端仅更新多比特参数表示中的单个比特，冻结其余比特，实现逐比特更新策略。

Result: 在5个常用数据集上的IID和非IID设置下进行实验，FedBiF不仅实现了优异的通信压缩，还促进了结果模型的稀疏性。使用1bpp上行和3bpp下行通信时，准确率与FedAvg相当。

Conclusion: FedBiF框架通过直接学习量化参数和逐比特更新策略，有效解决了联邦学习的通信开销问题，在保持模型精度的同时显著降低了通信成本。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is an emerging distributed machine learning paradigm
that enables collaborative model training without sharing local data. Despite
its advantages, FL suffers from substantial communication overhead, which can
affect training efficiency. Recent efforts have mitigated this issue by
quantizing model updates to reduce communication costs. However, most existing
methods apply quantization only after local training, introducing quantization
errors into the trained parameters and potentially degrading model accuracy. In
this paper, we propose Federated Bit Freezing (FedBiF), a novel FL framework
that directly learns quantized model parameters during local training. In each
communication round, the server first quantizes the model parameters and
transmits them to the clients. FedBiF then allows each client to update only a
single bit of the multi-bit parameter representation, freezing the remaining
bits. This bit-by-bit update strategy reduces each parameter update to one bit
while maintaining high precision in parameter representation. Extensive
experiments are conducted on five widely used datasets under both IID and
Non-IID settings. The results demonstrate that FedBiF not only achieves
superior communication compression but also promotes sparsity in the resulting
models. Notably, FedBiF attains accuracy comparable to FedAvg, even when using
only 1 bit-per-parameter (bpp) for uplink and 3 bpp for downlink communication.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 6G网络向超密集智能边缘环境发展，需要在严格隐私、移动性和能耗约束下实现高效资源管理，传统集中式方法面临隐私泄露和可扩展性问题。

Method: 采用联邦多智能体强化学习框架，每个智能体使用深度循环Q网络学习分散式策略，结合椭圆曲线Diffie-Hellman密钥交换的安全聚合协议保护隐私，将问题建模为部分可观测多智能体马尔可夫决策过程。

Conclusion: Fed-MARL框架为6G边缘网络提供了一种有效的隐私保护资源管理解决方案，通过分布式学习和安全聚合实现了性能优化和隐私保护的平衡。

Abstract: As sixth-generation (6G) networks move toward ultra-dense, intelligent edge
environments, efficient resource management under stringent privacy, mobility,
and energy constraints becomes critical. This paper introduces a novel
Federated Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (Fed-MARL) framework that
incorporates cross-layer orchestration of both the MAC layer and application
layer for energy-efficient, privacy-preserving, and real-time resource
management across heterogeneous edge devices. Each agent uses a Deep Recurrent
Q-Network (DRQN) to learn decentralized policies for task offloading, spectrum
access, and CPU energy adaptation based on local observations (e.g., queue
length, energy, CPU usage, and mobility). To protect privacy, we introduce a
secure aggregation protocol based on elliptic curve Diffie Hellman key
exchange, which ensures accurate model updates without exposing raw data to
semi-honest adversaries. We formulate the resource management problem as a
partially observable multi-agent Markov decision process (POMMDP) with a
multi-objective reward function that jointly optimizes latency, energy
efficiency, spectral efficiency, fairness, and reliability under 6G-specific
service requirements such as URLLC, eMBB, and mMTC. Simulation results
demonstrate that Fed-MARL outperforms centralized MARL and heuristic baselines
in task success rate, latency, energy efficiency, and fairness, while ensuring
robust privacy protection and scalability in dynamic, resource-constrained 6G
edge networks.

Motivation: 传统解码器由于输入的非唯一性只能获取错误概率分布，无法获得唯一正确预测，需要解决这个问题来提高量子纠错码的解码性能

Method: 将表面码解码问题重新构建为回归问题，使用神经网络数学插值来近似综合征测量，通过连续函数重新优化解码器模型

Result: 在码距5和7的多层感知机解码器，以及码距5的卷积神经网络、循环神经网络和Transformer解码器上，重新优化的解码器都比原始模型获得了更好的准确率

Conclusion: 将表面码解码问题转化为可由深度学习处理的回归问题是有效的策略，所提出的方法具有普遍有效性，不受码距或网络架构的限制

Abstract: Quantum error correction, which utilizes logical qubits that are encoded as
redundant multiple physical qubits to find and correct errors in physical
qubits, is indispensable for practical quantum computing. Surface code is
considered to be a promising encoding method with a high error threshold that
is defined by stabilizer generators. However, previous methods have suffered
from the problem that the decoder acquires solely the error probability
distribution because of the non-uniqueness of correct prediction obtained from
the input. To circumvent this problem, we propose a technique to reoptimize the
decoder model by approximating syndrome measurements with a continuous function
that is mathematically interpolated by neural network. We evaluated the
improvement in accuracy of a multilayer perceptron based decoder for code
distances of 5 and 7 as well as for decoders based on convolutional and
recurrent neural networks and transformers for a code distance of 5. In all
cases, the reoptimized decoder gave better accuracy than the original models,
demonstrating the universal effectiveness of the proposed method that is
independent of code distance or network architecture. These results suggest
that re-framing the problem of surface code decoding into a regression problem
that can be tackled by deep learning is a useful strategy.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了深度残差网络在标准随机初始化下的梯度训练动态，证明了当深度趋于无穷时，训练动态收敛到神经平均ODE动态，并分析了不同残差缩放因子对特征学习的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究深度残差网络在标准随机初始化下的训练动态，特别是当网络深度趋于无穷时的极限行为，以及不同参数缩放对特征学习能力的影响。

Method: 通过数学分析证明深度残差网络的训练动态收敛到神经平均ODE，使用传播混沌理论分析单元间的渐近独立性，并通过实验验证理论结果的紧致性。

Result: 获得了模型输出与极限之间的误差界O(1/L + α/√(LM))，证明了当α=Θ(1)时可以实现完全特征学习，而α→∞时则进入懒惰ODE机制。对于两层感知机块，确定了实现完全特征学习的最佳残差缩放因子为Θ(√D/(LM))。

Conclusion: 深度残差网络的训练动态在深度趋于无穷时收敛到平均ODE动态，不同的残差缩放因子会导致不同的特征学习机制，为理解深度残差网络的训练行为提供了新的数学视角。

Abstract: We study the gradient-based training of large-depth residual networks
(ResNets) from standard random initializations. We show that with a diverging
depth $L$, a fixed embedding dimension $D$, and an arbitrary hidden width $M$,
the training dynamics converges to a Neural Mean ODE training dynamics.
Remarkably, the limit is independent of the scaling of $M$, covering practical
cases of, say, Transformers, where $M$ (the number of hidden units or attention
heads per layer) is typically of the order of $D$. For a residual scale
$\Theta_D\big(\frac{\alpha}{LM}\big)$, we obtain the error bound
$O_D\big(\frac{1}{L}+ \frac{\alpha}{\sqrt{LM}}\big)$ between the model's output
and its limit after a fixed number gradient of steps, and we verify empirically
that this rate is tight. When $\alpha=\Theta(1)$, the limit exhibits complete
feature learning, i.e. the Mean ODE is genuinely non-linearly parameterized. In
contrast, we show that $\alpha \to \infty$ yields a \lazy ODE regime where the
Mean ODE is linearly parameterized. We then focus on the particular case of
ResNets with two-layer perceptron blocks, for which we study how these scalings
depend on the embedding dimension $D$. We show that for this model, the only
residual scale that leads to complete feature learning is
$\Theta\big(\frac{\sqrt{D}}{LM}\big)$. In this regime, we prove the error bound
$O\big(\frac{1}{L}+ \frac{\sqrt{D}}{\sqrt{LM}}\big)$ between the ResNet and its
limit after a fixed number of gradient steps, which is also empirically tight.
Our convergence results rely on a novel mathematical perspective on ResNets :
(i) due to the randomness of the initialization, the forward and backward pass
through the ResNet behave as the stochastic approximation of certain mean ODEs,
and (ii) by propagation of chaos (that is, asymptotic independence of the
units) this behavior is preserved through the training dynamics.

Abstract: We present a scalable framework for learning deterministic and probabilistic
neural surrogates for high-resolution 3D physics simulations. We introduce a
hybrid CNN-Transformer backbone architecture targeted for 3D physics
simulations, which significantly outperforms existing architectures in terms of
speed and accuracy. Our proposed network can be pretrained on small patches of
the simulation domain, which can be fused to obtain a global solution,
optionally guided via a fast and scalable sequence-to-sequence model to include
long-range dependencies. This setup allows for training large-scale models with
reduced memory and compute requirements for high-resolution datasets. We
evaluate our backbone architecture against a large set of baseline methods with
the objective to simultaneously learn the dynamics of 14 different types of
PDEs in 3D. We demonstrate how to scale our model to high-resolution isotropic
turbulence with spatial resolutions of up to $512^3$. Finally, we demonstrate
the versatility of our network by training it as a diffusion model to produce
probabilistic samples of highly turbulent 3D channel flows across varying
Reynolds numbers, accurately capturing the underlying flow statistics.

Abstract: Ensemble learning has been widely recognized as a pivotal technique for
boosting predictive performance by combining multiple base models.
Nevertheless, conventional margin-based ensemble methods predominantly focus on
maximizing the expected margin while neglecting the critical role of margin
variance, which inherently restricts the generalization capability of the model
and heightens its vulnerability to overfitting, particularly in noisy or
imbalanced datasets. Additionally, the conventional approach of optimizing
ensemble weights within the probability simplex often introduces computational
inefficiency and scalability challenges, complicating its application to
large-scale problems. To tackle these limitations, this paper introduces a
novel ensemble learning framework that explicitly incorporates margin variance
into the loss function. Our method jointly optimizes the negative expected
margin and its variance, leading to enhanced robustness and improved
generalization performance. Moreover, by reparameterizing the ensemble weights
onto the unit sphere, we substantially simplify the optimization process and
improve computational efficiency. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple
benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach consistently
outperforms traditional margin-based ensemble techniques, underscoring its
effectiveness and practical utility.

Abstract: Fatigue life prediction is essential in both the design and operational
phases of any aircraft, and in this sense safety in the aerospace industry
requires early detection of fatigue cracks to prevent in-flight failures.
Robust and precise fatigue life predictors are thus essential to ensure safety.
Traditional engineering methods, while reliable, are time consuming and involve
complex workflows, including steps such as conducting several Finite Element
Method (FEM) simulations, deriving the expected loading spectrum, and applying
cycle counting techniques like peak-valley or rainflow counting. These steps
often require collaboration between multiple teams and tools, added to the
computational time and effort required to achieve fatigue life predictions.
Machine learning (ML) offers a promising complement to traditional fatigue life
estimation methods, enabling faster iterations and generalization, providing
quick estimates that guide decisions alongside conventional simulations.
  In this paper, we present a ML-based pipeline that aims to estimate the
fatigue life of different aircraft wing locations given the flight parameters
of the different missions that the aircraft will be operating throughout its
operational life. We validate the pipeline in a realistic use case of fatigue
life estimation, yielding accurate predictions alongside a thorough statistical
validation and uncertainty quantification. Our pipeline constitutes a
complement to traditional methodologies by reducing the amount of costly
simulations and, thereby, lowering the required computational and human
resources.

systematic evaluation uses 1k reviews of 2024 ICLR papers generated by a wide
range of LLMs shows two distinct results: I) very simple prompt injections are
indeed highly effective, reaching up to 100% acceptance scores. II) LLM reviews
are generally biased toward acceptance (>95% in many models). Both results have
great impact on the ongoing discussions on LLM usage in peer-review.

Abstract: Ionic liquids (ILs) have emerged as versatile replacements for traditional
solvents because their physicochemical properties can be precisely tailored to
various applications. However, accurately predicting key thermophysical
properties remains challenging due to the vast chemical design space and the
limited availability of experimental data. In this study, we present a
data-driven transfer learning framework that leverages a neural recommender
system (NRS) to enable reliable property prediction for ILs using sparse
experimental datasets. The approach involves a two-stage process: first,
pre-training NRS models on COSMO-RS-based simulated data at fixed temperature
and pressure to learn property-specific structural embeddings for cations and
anions; and second, fine-tuning simple feedforward neural networks using these
embeddings with experimental data at varying temperatures and pressures. In
this work, five essential IL properties are considered: density, viscosity,
surface tension, heat capacity, and melting point. The framework supports both
within-property and cross-property knowledge transfer. Notably, pre-trained
models for density, viscosity, and heat capacity are used to fine-tune models
for all five target properties, achieving improved performance by a substantial
margin for four of them. The model exhibits robust extrapolation to previously
unseen ILs. Moreover, the final trained models enable property prediction for
over 700,000 IL combinations, offering a scalable solution for IL screening in
process design. This work highlights the effectiveness of combining simulated
data and transfer learning to overcome sparsity in the experimental data.

Motivation: 在灾难场景下传统能源基础设施受损时，太阳能家庭与移动充电单元之间需要安全可追溯的能源交易。为保证区块链交易的完整性，需要稳健且不可预测的非字生成机制。

Abstract: In disaster scenarios where conventional energy infrastructure is
compromised, secure and traceable energy trading between solar-powered
households and mobile charging units becomes a necessity. To ensure the
integrity of such transactions over a blockchain network, robust and
unpredictable nonce generation is vital. This study proposes an SDN-enabled
architecture where machine learning regressors are leveraged not for their
accuracy, but for their potential to generate randomized values suitable as
nonce candidates. Therefore, it is newly called Proof of AutoML. Here, SDN
allows flexible control over data flows and energy routing policies even in
fragmented or degraded networks, ensuring adaptive response during emergencies.
Using a 9000-sample dataset, we evaluate five AutoML-selected regression models
- Gradient Boosting, LightGBM, Random Forest, Extra Trees, and K-Nearest
Neighbors - not by their prediction accuracy, but by their ability to produce
diverse and non-deterministic outputs across shuffled data inputs. Randomness
analysis reveals that Random Forest and Extra Trees regressors exhibit complete
dependency on randomness, whereas Gradient Boosting, K-Nearest Neighbors and
LightGBM show strong but slightly lower randomness scores (97.6%, 98.8% and
99.9%, respectively). These findings highlight that certain machine learning
models, particularly tree-based ensembles, may serve as effective and
lightweight nonce generators within blockchain-secured, SDN-based energy
trading infrastructures resilient to disaster conditions.

Motivation: 传统在线RL方法需要大量模拟交互且样本效率低，无法捕捉真实世界复杂性，需要直接从历史数据学习调度策略的离线方法

Method: CDQAC算法结合分位数critic和延迟策略更新，估计每个机器-操作对的回报分布而非直接选择，能够从次优训练数据中改进

Result: CDQAC显著优于原始数据生成启发式方法，超越最先进的离线和在线RL基线，仅需10-20个训练实例即可学习高质量策略

Conclusion: CDQAC是从历史数据学习调度策略的有效离线RL方法，特别有趣的是在随机启发式生成的数据上表现优于高质量数据

Abstract: The Job-Shop Scheduling Problem (JSP) and Flexible Job-Shop Scheduling
Problem (FJSP), are canonical combinatorial optimization problems with
wide-ranging applications in industrial operations. In recent years, many
online reinforcement learning (RL) approaches have been proposed to learn
constructive heuristics for JSP and FJSP. Although effective, these online RL
methods require millions of interactions with simulated environments that may
not capture real-world complexities, and their random policy initialization
leads to poor sample efficiency. To address these limitations, we introduce
Conservative Discrete Quantile Actor-Critic (CDQAC), a novel offline RL
algorithm that learns effective scheduling policies directly from historical
data, eliminating the need for costly online interactions, while maintaining
the ability to improve upon suboptimal training data. CDQAC couples a
quantile-based critic with a delayed policy update, estimating the return
distribution of each machine-operation pair rather than selecting pairs
outright. Our extensive experiments demonstrate CDQAC's remarkable ability to
learn from diverse data sources. CDQAC consistently outperforms the original
data-generating heuristics and surpasses state-of-the-art offline and online RL
baselines. In addition, CDQAC is highly sample efficient, requiring only 10-20
training instances to learn high-quality policies. Surprisingly, we find that
CDQAC performs better when trained on data generated by a random heuristic than
when trained on higher-quality data from genetic algorithms and priority
dispatching rules.

Abstract: In the aftermath of disasters, many institutions worldwide face challenges in
continually monitoring changes in disaster risk, limiting the ability of key
decision-makers to assess progress towards the UN Sendai Framework for Disaster
Risk Reduction 2015-2030. While numerous efforts have substantially advanced
the large-scale modeling of hazard and exposure through Earth observation and
data-driven methods, progress remains limited in modeling another equally
important yet challenging element of the risk equation: physical vulnerability.
To address this gap, we introduce Graph Categorical Structured Variational
Autoencoder (GraphCSVAE), a novel probabilistic data-driven framework for
modeling physical vulnerability by integrating deep learning, graph
representation, and categorical probabilistic inference, using time-series
satellite-derived datasets and prior expert belief systems. We introduce a
weakly supervised first-order transition matrix that reflects the changes in
the spatiotemporal distribution of physical vulnerability in two
disaster-stricken and socioeconomically disadvantaged areas: (1) the
cyclone-impacted coastal Khurushkul community in Bangladesh and (2) the
mudslide-affected city of Freetown in Sierra Leone. Our work reveals
post-disaster regional dynamics in physical vulnerability, offering valuable
insights into localized spatiotemporal auditing and sustainable strategies for
post-disaster risk reduction.

TL;DR: 基于ARIMA模型思想的卷积模块，通过趋势和局部变化分解实现长期时间序列预测，具有简单高效的特点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统ARIMA模型需要迭代多步预测、难以扩展到多变量设置的问题，提出一种简单有效的模块。

Method: 设计包含两个卷积组件的模块：一个用于捕捉趋势（自回归），另一个用于精炼局部变化（移动平均），直接进行多步预测。

Result: 在9个标准数据集上进行实验，ARMA方法在准确性方面与现有方法相竞争，尤其在显示强烈趋势变化的数据集上表现优异，同时保持了结构简单性。

Conclusion: 该模块不仅在长期预测任务上表现竞争力，还能内在编码绝对位置信息，有潜力作为轻量级的位置嵌入替代方案用于序列模型。

Abstract: This paper proposes a simple yet effective convolutional module for long-term
time series forecasting. The proposed block, inspired by the Auto-Regressive
Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model, consists of two convolutional
components: one for capturing the trend (autoregression) and the other for
refining local variations (moving average). Unlike conventional ARIMA, which
requires iterative multi-step forecasting, the block directly performs
multi-step forecasting, making it easily extendable to multivariate settings.
Experiments on nine widely used benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method
ARMA achieves competitive accuracy, particularly on datasets exhibiting strong
trend variations, while maintaining architectural simplicity. Furthermore,
analysis shows that the block inherently encodes absolute positional
information, suggesting its potential as a lightweight replacement for
positional embeddings in sequential models.

Abstract: We present a machine learning framework for adaptive source localization in
which agents use a structure-preserving digital twin of a coupled
hydrodynamic-transport system for real-time trajectory planning and data
assimilation. The twin is constructed with conditional neural Whitney forms
(CNWF), coupling the numerical guarantees of finite element exterior calculus
(FEEC) with transformer-based operator learning. The resulting model preserves
discrete conservation, and adapts in real time to streaming sensor data. It
employs a conditional attention mechanism to identify: a reduced Whitney-form
basis; reduced integral balance equations; and a source field, each compatible
with given sensor measurements. The induced reduced-order environmental model
retains the stability and consistency of standard finite-element simulation,
yielding a physically realizable, regular mapping from sensor data to the
source field. We propose a staggered scheme that alternates between evaluating
the digital twin and applying Lloyd's algorithm to guide sensor placement, with
analysis providing conditions for monotone improvement of a coverage
functional. Using the predicted source field as an importance function within
an optimal-recovery scheme, we demonstrate recovery of point sources under
continuity assumptions, highlighting the role of regularity as a sufficient
condition for localization. Experimental comparisons with physics-agnostic
transformer architectures show improved accuracy in complex geometries when
physical constraints are enforced, indicating that structure preservation
provides an effective inductive bias for source identification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的数据集程缩方法存在不统一性，且主要关注模型的法法性能，需要一个更一般化的框架来包容更多的目标要求。

Method: 提出一个统一框架，使用偏差量来形式化地定义数据集程缩任务，通过量化概率分布之间的距离来实现。

Result: 该框架能够包容现有的数据集程缩方法，并且支持多重目标的优化，包括模型的精细性、稳健性、隐私性等。

Conclusion: 通过偏差量的形式化定义，数据集程缩任务可以被扩展到更广泛的应用场景，为后续研究提供了理论基础和方法论支撑。

Abstract: Given a dataset of finitely many elements $\mathcal{T} = \{\mathbf{x}_i\}_{i
= 1}^N$, the goal of dataset condensation (DC) is to construct a synthetic
dataset $\mathcal{S} = \{\tilde{\mathbf{x}}_j\}_{j = 1}^M$ which is
significantly smaller ($M \ll N$) such that a model trained from scratch on
$\mathcal{S}$ achieves comparable or even superior generalization performance
to a model trained on $\mathcal{T}$. Recent advances in DC reveal a close
connection to the problem of approximating the data distribution represented by
$\mathcal{T}$ with a reduced set of points. In this work, we present a unified
framework that encompasses existing DC methods and extend the task-specific
notion of DC to a more general and formal definition using notions of
discrepancy, which quantify the distance between probability distribution in
different regimes. Our framework broadens the objective of DC beyond
generalization, accommodating additional objectives such as robustness,
privacy, and other desirable properties.

Abstract: Contrastive learning is a widely adopted self-supervised pretraining
strategy, yet its dependence on cohort composition remains underexplored. We
present Contrasting by Patient Augmented Electrocardiograms (CAPE) foundation
model and pretrain on four cohorts (n = 5,203,352), from diverse populations
across three continents (North America, South America, Asia). We systematically
assess how cohort demographics, health status, and population diversity
influence the downstream performance for prediction tasks also including two
additional cohorts from another continent (Europe). We find that downstream
performance depends on the distributional properties of the pretraining cohort,
including demographics and health status. Moreover, while pretraining with a
multi-centre, demographically diverse cohort improves in-distribution accuracy,
it reduces out-of-distribution (OOD) generalisation of our contrastive approach
by encoding cohort-specific artifacts. To address this, we propose the
In-Distribution Batch (IDB) strategy, which preserves intra-cohort consistency
during pretraining and enhances OOD robustness. This work provides important
insights for developing clinically fair and generalisable foundation models.

Motivation: 虽然许多在有限维欧几里得空间中开发的生成模型在无限维设置中都有函数化推广，但整流流向无限维空间的扩展仍然未被探索。

Method: 基于无限维空间中连续性方程的叠加原理，建立了无限维希尔伯特空间中整流流的严格函数化表述框架，并将其自然扩展到函数流匹配和函数概率流ODE。

Result: 实验证明该方法相比现有函数生成模型具有更优越的性能，同时移除了现有函数流匹配理论中的限制性测度论假设。

Conclusion: 成功建立了无限维空间中整流流的理论框架，为函数生成模型提供了新的非线性推广方法，并在实践中验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Many generative models originally developed in finite-dimensional Euclidean
space have functional generalizations in infinite-dimensional settings.
However, the extension of rectified flow to infinite-dimensional spaces remains
unexplored. In this work, we establish a rigorous functional formulation of
rectified flow in an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space. Our approach builds
upon the superposition principle for continuity equations in an
infinite-dimensional space. We further show that this framework extends
naturally to functional flow matching and functional probability flow ODEs,
interpreting them as nonlinear generalizations of rectified flow. Notably, our
extension to functional flow matching removes the restrictive measure-theoretic
assumptions in the existing theory of \citet{kerrigan2024functional}.
Furthermore, we demonstrate experimentally that our method achieves superior
performance compared to existing functional generative models.

Motivation: 相机陷阱监测生物多样性时，物种识别因标注资源有限成为主要瓶颈，传统主动学习方法只关注个体预测不确定性，忽略了整个数据集的不确定性。

Method: 引入Vendi信息增益(VIG)主动学习策略，基于图像对整个数据集预测不确定性的影响来选择样本，同时考虑信息量和多样性。

Result: 在Snapshot Serengeti数据集上，VIG仅使用不到10%的标签就达到接近全监督的预测准确率，在不同指标和批次大小下均优于标准基线方法，并在特征空间中收集到更多样化的数据。

Conclusion: VIG方法在数据有限的环境中具有广泛适用性，对生物多样性监测具有重要价值，能够有效解决标注资源有限的挑战。

Abstract: While monitoring biodiversity through camera traps has become an important
endeavor for ecological research, identifying species in the captured image
data remains a major bottleneck due to limited labeling resources. Active
learning -- a machine learning paradigm that selects the most informative data
to label and train a predictive model -- offers a promising solution, but
typically focuses on uncertainty in the individual predictions without
considering uncertainty across the entire dataset. We introduce a new active
learning policy, Vendi information gain (VIG), that selects images based on
their impact on dataset-wide prediction uncertainty, capturing both
informativeness and diversity. Applied to the Snapshot Serengeti dataset, VIG
achieves impressive predictive accuracy close to full supervision using less
than 10% of the labels. It consistently outperforms standard baselines across
metrics and batch sizes, collecting more diverse data in the feature space. VIG
has broad applicability beyond ecology, and our results highlight its value for
biodiversity monitoring in data-limited environments.

Abstract: Masked diffusion large language models (dLLMs) are emerging as promising
alternatives to autoregressive LLMs, offering competitive performance while
supporting unique generation capabilities such as inpainting. We explore how
inpainting can inform RL algorithm design for dLLMs. Aligning LLMs with
reinforcement learning faces an exploration challenge: sparse reward signals
and sample waste when models fail to discover correct solutions. While this
inefficiency affects LLMs broadly, dLLMs offer a distinctive opportunity--their
inpainting ability can guide exploration. We introduce IGPO (Inpainting Guided
Policy Optimization), an RL framework that strategically inserts partial
ground-truth reasoning traces during online sampling. Unlike providing full
solutions, inpainting steers exploration toward promising trajectory spaces
while preserving self-generated reasoning, bridging supervised fine-tuning and
reinforcement learning. We apply IGPO to group-based optimization methods such
as GRPO, where exploration failures cause zero advantages and gradients. IGPO
restores meaningful gradients while improving sample efficiency. We also
propose supervised fine-tuning on synthetically rewritten concise traces that
better align with dLLM generation patterns. With additional techniques
including entropy-based filtering, our training recipe yields substantial gains
across three mathematical benchmarks--GSM8K, Math500, and AMC--achieving new
state-of-the-art results for full-attention masked dLLMs.

Motivation: 解决Transformer在处理长序列时注意力机制的二次计算复杂度问题，传统方法要么只聚类键值要么使用统一聚类，无法充分保持注意力机制的非对称特性

Method: 在学习的表示空间中分别对查询和键进行语义聚类，采用分层两阶段注意力机制，使用质心近似（单极）加方向方差校正（偶极）来保留更丰富信息

Result: 在8k上下文长度下比CUDNN Flash Attention快3倍，相对平方误差低于20%；在16k上下文的30M参数模型预训练中，运行时间减少12.2%，性能损失仅0.36%

Conclusion: 多极近似方法在保持Transformer性能的同时显著提升效率，证明了该方法在大规模预训练中的可行性

Abstract: We present Multipole Semantic Attention (MuSe), an efficient approximation of
softmax attention that combines semantic clustering with multipole expansions
from computational physics. Our method addresses the quadratic computational
complexity of transformers in the context length by clustering queries and keys
separately in their learned representation spaces, enabling a hierarchical
two-stage attention mechanism. Unlike prior clustering approaches that group
only keys or use unified clustering, we maintain separate clusterings that
respect attention's asymmetric treatment of these spaces. We augment
centroid-based (monopole) approximations with dipole corrections that capture
directional variance within clusters, preserving richer information during
training. The method operates as a drop-in replacement for standard attention,
requiring only hyperparameter specification without architectural
modifications. Our approach achieves $\mathcal{O}(NCD)$ complexity for acausal
attention with $C$ clusters and $\mathcal{O}(NCD \log N)$ for causal attention.
On isolated attention layers, we demonstrate $3\times$ speedup over CUDNN Flash
Attention at 8k context length, with relative squared errors below 20%. For
causal attention, we develop a hierarchical block decomposition that combines
exact local computation with efficient long-range approximation. In end-to-end
pretraining of a 30M parameter model on book-length texts with 16k context, we
achieve 12.2% runtime reduction with only 0.36% loss degradation, establishing
the viability of multipole approximations for efficient transformer
pretraining.

Abstract: Ensuring the resilience of computer-based railways is increasingly crucial to
account for uncertainties and changes due to the growing complexity and
criticality of those systems. Although their software relies on strict
verification and validation processes following well-established best-practices
and certification standards, anomalies can still occur at run-time due to
residual faults, system and environmental modifications that were unknown at
design-time, or other emergent cyber-threat scenarios. This paper explores
run-time control-flow anomaly detection using process mining to enhance the
resilience of ERTMS/ETCS L2 (European Rail Traffic Management System / European
Train Control System Level 2). Process mining allows learning the actual
control flow of the system from its execution traces, thus enabling run-time
monitoring through online conformance checking. In addition, anomaly
localization is performed through unsupervised machine learning to link
relevant deviations to critical system components. We test our approach on a
reference ERTMS/ETCS L2 scenario, namely the RBC/RBC Handover, to show its
capability to detect and localize anomalies with high accuracy, efficiency, and
explainability.

Abstract: Modern machine learning often requires training with large batch size,
distributed data, and massively parallel compute hardware (like mobile and
other edge devices or distributed data centers). Communication becomes a major
bottleneck in such settings but methods like Local Stochastic Gradient Descent
(Local SGD) show great promise in reducing this additional communication
overhead. Local SGD consists of three parts: a local optimization process, an
aggregation mechanism, and an outer optimizer that uses the aggregated updates
from the nodes to produce a new model. While there exists an extensive
literature on understanding the impact of hyperparameters in the local
optimization process, the choice of outer optimizer and its hyperparameters is
less clear. We study the role of the outer optimizer in Local SGD, and prove
new convergence guarantees for the algorithm. In particular, we show that
tuning the outer learning rate allows us to (a) trade off between optimization
error and stochastic gradient noise variance, and (b) make up for ill-tuning of
the inner learning rate. Our theory suggests that the outer learning rate
should sometimes be set to values greater than $1$. We extend our results to
settings where we use momentum in the outer optimizer, and we show a similar
role for the momentum-adjusted outer learning rate. We also study acceleration
in the outer optimizer and show that it improves the convergence rate as a
function of the number of communication rounds, improving upon the convergence
rate of prior algorithms that apply acceleration locally. Finally, we also
introduce a novel data-dependent analysis of Local SGD that yields further
insights on outer learning rate tuning. We conduct comprehensive experiments
with standard language models and various outer optimizers to validate our
theory.
