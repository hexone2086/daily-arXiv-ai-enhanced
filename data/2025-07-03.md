*Zeyi Liu,Shuang Li,Eric Cousineau,Siyuan Feng,Benjamin Burchfiel,Shuran Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种4D视频生成模型，通过跨视角点图对齐监督，实现多视角3D一致性，提升机器人动态场景预测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 增强机器人在复杂环境中规划和交互的能力，解决现有视频生成模型在时间连贯性和几何一致性上的挑战。

Method: 利用RGB-D观测数据，通过跨视角点图对齐监督训练模型，无需相机姿态输入即可预测未来视频序列。

Result: 在模拟和真实机器人数据集上生成更稳定、空间对齐的视频预测，并支持机器人末端执行器轨迹恢复。

Conclusion: 该方法在机器人操作和新视角泛化中表现出鲁棒性，为动态场景建模提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Understanding and predicting the dynamics of the physical world can enhance a
robot's ability to plan and interact effectively in complex environments. While
recent video generation models have shown strong potential in modeling dynamic
scenes, generating videos that are both temporally coherent and geometrically
consistent across camera views remains a significant challenge. To address
this, we propose a 4D video generation model that enforces multi-view 3D
consistency of videos by supervising the model with cross-view pointmap
alignment during training. This geometric supervision enables the model to
learn a shared 3D representation of the scene, allowing it to predict future
video sequences from novel viewpoints based solely on the given RGB-D
observations, without requiring camera poses as inputs. Compared to existing
baselines, our method produces more visually stable and spatially aligned
predictions across multiple simulated and real-world robotic datasets. We
further show that the predicted 4D videos can be used to recover robot
end-effector trajectories using an off-the-shelf 6DoF pose tracker, supporting
robust robot manipulation and generalization to novel camera viewpoints.

necessitating accurate detection and predictive mapping across diverse
geographic regions. With advancements in deep learning and remote sensing,
automated landslide detection has become increasingly effective. This study
presents a comprehensive approach integrating multi-source satellite imagery
and deep learning models to enhance landslide identification and prediction. We
leverage Sentinel-2 multispectral data and ALOS PALSAR-derived slope and
Digital Elevation Model (DEM) layers to capture critical environmental features
influencing landslide occurrences. Various geospatial analysis techniques are
employed to assess the impact of terra in characteristics, vegetation cover,

of multiple stateof-the-art deep learning segmentation models, including U-Net,
DeepLabV3+, and Res-Net, to determine their effectiveness in landslide
detection. The proposed framework contributes to the development of reliable

Method: 开发cp_measure，提取CellProfiler的核心测量功能，设计为模块化、API优先的工具。

Result: cp_measure特征与CellProfiler特征高度一致，并能无缝集成科学Python生态系统。

Conclusion: cp_measure支持可重复、自动化的图像分析流程，适用于计算生物学中的机器学习应用。

Abstract: Biological image analysis has traditionally focused on measuring specific
visual properties of interest for cells or other entities. A complementary
paradigm gaining increasing traction is image-based profiling - quantifying
many distinct visual features to form comprehensive profiles which may reveal
hidden patterns in cellular states, drug responses, and disease mechanisms.
While current tools like CellProfiler can generate these feature sets, they
pose significant barriers to automated and reproducible analyses, hindering
machine learning workflows. Here we introduce cp_measure, a Python library that
extracts CellProfiler's core measurement capabilities into a modular, API-first
tool designed for programmatic feature extraction. We demonstrate that
cp_measure features retain high fidelity with CellProfiler features while
enabling seamless integration with the scientific Python ecosystem. Through
applications to 3D astrocyte imaging and spatial transcriptomics, we showcase
how cp_measure enables reproducible, automated image-based profiling pipelines
that scale effectively for machine learning applications in computational
biology.

### [4] [Rapid Salient Object Detection with Difference Convolutional Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01182)
*Zhuo Su,Li Liu,Matthias Müller,Jiehua Zhang,Diana Wofk,Ming-Ming Cheng,Matti Pietikäinen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种高效的显著目标检测网络设计，结合传统方法与现代CNN，通过像素差异卷积（PDCs）和差异卷积重参数化（DCR）提升效率，在资源受限设备上实现实时性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有显著目标检测（SOD）模型在资源受限设备上计算开销大的问题，实现实时性能。

Method: 结合传统SOD方法和现代CNN，使用PDCs编码特征对比，引入DCR策略减少推理时的计算和参数，并针对视频SOD提出STDC。

Result: 提出的SDNet和STDNet在Jetson Orin设备上分别以46 FPS和150 FPS运行，参数少于1M，速度和准确性均优于其他轻量级模型。

Conclusion: 该方法在效率和准确性之间取得了显著平衡，适用于资源受限设备的实时SOD任务。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of deploying salient object detection
(SOD) on resource-constrained devices with real-time performance. While recent
advances in deep neural networks have improved SOD, existing top-leading models
are computationally expensive. We propose an efficient network design that
combines traditional wisdom on SOD and the representation power of modern CNNs.
Like biologically-inspired classical SOD methods relying on computing contrast
cues to determine saliency of image regions, our model leverages Pixel
Difference Convolutions (PDCs) to encode the feature contrasts. Differently,
PDCs are incorporated in a CNN architecture so that the valuable contrast cues
are extracted from rich feature maps. For efficiency, we introduce a difference
convolution reparameterization (DCR) strategy that embeds PDCs into standard
convolutions, eliminating computation and parameters at inference.
Additionally, we introduce SpatioTemporal Difference Convolution (STDC) for
video SOD, enhancing the standard 3D convolution with spatiotemporal contrast
capture. Our models, SDNet for image SOD and STDNet for video SOD, achieve
significant improvements in efficiency-accuracy trade-offs. On a Jetson Orin
device, our models with $<$ 1M parameters operate at 46 FPS and 150 FPS on
streamed images and videos, surpassing the second-best lightweight models in
our experiments by more than $2\times$ and $3\times$ in speed with superior
accuracy. Code will be available at https://github.com/hellozhuo/stdnet.git.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于单模态并行处理的鲁棒框架，用于处理多模态MRI数据缺失时的脑肿瘤分割问题，通过Holder散度和互信息保持模态特征，并在BraTS数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态MRI数据常因图像质量、协议不一致、患者过敏或经济限制而缺失，传统方法难以应对，需要一种鲁棒的解决方案。

Method: 采用单模态并行处理框架，结合Holder散度和互信息，动态调整网络参数以量化预测与真实标签的差异。

Result: 在BraTS 2018和2020数据集上表现出优于现有方法的性能，尤其在处理缺失模态时。

Conclusion: 该框架通过信息损失函数有效解决了多模态缺失问题，为脑肿瘤分割提供了高精度的解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal MRI provides critical complementary information for accurate brain
tumor segmentation. However, conventional methods struggle when certain
modalities are missing due to issues such as image quality, protocol
inconsistencies, patient allergies, or financial constraints. To address this,
we propose a robust single-modality parallel processing framework that achieves
high segmentation accuracy even with incomplete modalities. Leveraging Holder
divergence and mutual information, our model maintains modality-specific
features while dynamically adjusting network parameters based on the available
inputs. By using these divergence- and information-based loss functions, the
framework effectively quantifies discrepancies between predictions and
ground-truth labels, resulting in consistently accurate segmentation. Extensive
evaluations on the BraTS 2018 and BraTS 2020 datasets demonstrate superior
performance over existing methods in handling missing modalities.

*Xiao Liu,Jiawei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出AIGVE-MACS模型，用于AI生成视频的多方面评估，提供分数和语言反馈，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI生成视频评估指标缺乏解释性，难以与人类评价对齐，需改进。

Method: 结合Vision-Language模型、加权损失和动态帧采样策略，利用AIGVE-BENCH 2数据集训练。

Result: AIGVE-MACS在评分相关性和评论质量上表现最优，视频生成质量提升53.5%。

Conclusion: AIGVE-MACS为AI生成视频评估提供了全面、人类对齐的新范式。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of AI-generated video models has created a pressing
need for robust and interpretable evaluation frameworks. Existing metrics are
limited to producing numerical scores without explanatory comments, resulting
in low interpretability and human evaluation alignment. To address those
challenges, we introduce AIGVE-MACS, a unified model for AI-Generated Video
Evaluation(AIGVE), which can provide not only numerical scores but also
multi-aspect language comment feedback in evaluating these generated videos.
Central to our approach is AIGVE-BENCH 2, a large-scale benchmark comprising
2,500 AI-generated videos and 22,500 human-annotated detailed comments and
numerical scores across nine critical evaluation aspects. Leveraging
AIGVE-BENCH 2, AIGVE-MACS incorporates recent Vision-Language Models with a
novel token-wise weighted loss and a dynamic frame sampling strategy to better
align with human evaluators. Comprehensive experiments across supervised and
zero-shot benchmarks demonstrate that AIGVE-MACS achieves state-of-the-art
performance in both scoring correlation and comment quality, significantly
outperforming prior baselines including GPT-4o and VideoScore. In addition, we
further showcase a multi-agent refinement framework where feedback from
AIGVE-MACS drives iterative improvements in video generation, leading to 53.5%
quality enhancement. This work establishes a new paradigm for comprehensive,
human-aligned evaluation of AI-generated videos. We release the AIGVE-BENCH 2
and AIGVE-MACS at https://huggingface.co/xiaoliux/AIGVE-MACS.

### [7] [Advancements in Weed Mapping: A Systematic Review](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01269)
*Mohammad Jahanbakht,Alex Olsen,Ross Marchant,Emilie Fillols,Mostafa Rahimi Azghadi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文综述了杂草测绘领域的最新方法，填补了从数据采集到处理技术的全面文献空白，旨在推动高效、可持续的杂草管理系统发展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 杂草测绘对精准管理至关重要，但缺乏全面的文献综述，限制了该领域的进展。

Method: 系统审查数据采集（传感器与平台技术）、数据处理（标注与建模）和测绘技术（时空分析与决策支持工具）的最先进方法。

Result: 通过PRISMA指南评估文献，提供了对杂草测绘领域的整体理解。

Conclusion: 该综述为未来研究提供了基础参考，支持开发高效、可扩展且可持续的杂草管理系统。

Abstract: Weed mapping plays a critical role in precision management by providing
accurate and timely data on weed distribution, enabling targeted control and
reduced herbicide use. This minimizes environmental impacts, supports
sustainable land management, and improves outcomes across agricultural and
natural environments. Recent advances in weed mapping leverage ground-vehicle
Red Green Blue (RGB) cameras, satellite and drone-based remote sensing combined
with sensors such as spectral, Near Infra-Red (NIR), and thermal cameras. The
resulting data are processed using advanced techniques including big data
analytics and machine learning, significantly improving the spatial and
temporal resolution of weed maps and enabling site-specific management
decisions. Despite a growing body of research in this domain, there is a lack
of comprehensive literature reviews specifically focused on weed mapping. In
particular, the absence of a structured analysis spanning the entire mapping
pipeline, from data acquisition to processing techniques and mapping tools,
limits progress in the field. This review addresses these gaps by
systematically examining state-of-the-art methods in data acquisition (sensor
and platform technologies), data processing (including annotation and
modelling), and mapping techniques (such as spatiotemporal analysis and
decision support tools). Following PRISMA guidelines, we critically evaluate
and synthesize key findings from the literature to provide a holistic
understanding of the weed mapping landscape. This review serves as a
foundational reference to guide future research and support the development of
efficient, scalable, and sustainable weed management systems.

### [8] [Frequency Domain-Based Diffusion Model for Unpaired Image Dehazing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01275)
*Chengxu Liu,Lu Qi,Jinshan Pan,Xueming Qian,Ming-Hsuan Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于频域的扩散模型（\ours），用于无配对图像去雾，通过振幅残差编码器（ARE）和相位校正模块（PCM）优化去雾效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于对比学习的方法引入了与雾无关的内容信息，且忽略了频域中雾相关的特性（如振幅谱中的退化表现）。

Method: 使用扩散模型（DMs）从频域重建角度处理去雾任务，提出ARE提取振幅残差，PCM通过注意力机制优化相位谱。

Result: 实验表明，\ours 在合成和真实数据集上优于其他最先进方法。

Conclusion: 频域扩散模型结合ARE和PCM能有效提升无配对图像去雾性能。

Abstract: Unpaired image dehazing has attracted increasing attention due to its
flexible data requirements during model training. Dominant methods based on
contrastive learning not only introduce haze-unrelated content information, but
also ignore haze-specific properties in the frequency domain (\ie,~haze-related
degradation is mainly manifested in the amplitude spectrum). To address these
issues, we propose a novel frequency domain-based diffusion model, named \ours,
for fully exploiting the beneficial knowledge in unpaired clear data. In
particular, inspired by the strong generative ability shown by Diffusion Models
(DMs), we tackle the dehazing task from the perspective of frequency domain
reconstruction and perform the DMs to yield the amplitude spectrum consistent
with the distribution of clear images. To implement it, we propose an Amplitude
Residual Encoder (ARE) to extract the amplitude residuals, which effectively
compensates for the amplitude gap from the hazy to clear domains, as well as
provide supervision for the DMs training. In addition, we propose a Phase
Correction Module (PCM) to eliminate artifacts by further refining the phase
spectrum during dehazing with a simple attention mechanism. Experimental
results demonstrate that our \ours outperforms other state-of-the-art methods
on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

Method: 提出了一种基于预训练模型任务先验的注意力机制，生成集成令牌，共享预训练编码器的互信息，计算成本低。

Result: 在多种面部分析任务中表现出特征表示的显著提升。

Conclusion: ET-Fuser通过集成令牌和注意力机制，有效提升了面部分析任务的性能和效率。

Abstract: Facial analysis exhibits task-specific feature variations. While
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have enabled the fine-grained
representation of spatial information, Vision Transformers (ViTs) have
facilitated the representation of semantic information at the patch level.
Although the generalization of conventional methodologies has advanced visual
interpretability, there remains paucity of research that preserves the unified
feature representation on single task learning during the training process. In
this work, we introduce ET-Fuser, a novel methodology for learning ensemble
token by leveraging attention mechanisms based on task priors derived from
pre-trained models for facial analysis. Specifically, we propose a robust prior
unification learning method that generates a ensemble token within a
self-attention mechanism, which shares the mutual information along the
pre-trained encoders. This ensemble token approach offers high efficiency with
negligible computational cost. Our results show improvements across a variety
of facial analysis, with statistically significant enhancements observed in the
feature representations.

TL;DR: 提出了一种通过将任务重新定义为镀铬球修复问题，从单张低动态范围（LDR）图像估计光照的简单有效方法。利用预训练的扩散模型Stable Diffusion XL，克服了依赖有限HDR全景数据集的现有方法的泛化问题。通过迭代修复生成中值镀铬球作为稳定的低频光照先验，并结合Exposure LoRA生成HDR光探针。进一步提出DiffusionLight-Turbo，将运行时间从30分钟缩短至30秒。

Conclusion: DiffusionLight和DiffusionLight-Turbo通过创新的修复和加速技术，有效解决了光照估计中的泛化和效率问题。

Abstract: We introduce a simple yet effective technique for estimating lighting from a
single low-dynamic-range (LDR) image by reframing the task as a chrome ball
inpainting problem. This approach leverages a pre-trained diffusion model,
Stable Diffusion XL, to overcome the generalization failures of existing
methods that rely on limited HDR panorama datasets. While conceptually simple,
the task remains challenging because diffusion models often insert incorrect or
inconsistent content and cannot readily generate chrome balls in HDR format.
Our analysis reveals that the inpainting process is highly sensitive to the
initial noise in the diffusion process, occasionally resulting in unrealistic
outputs. To address this, we first introduce DiffusionLight, which uses
iterative inpainting to compute a median chrome ball from multiple outputs to
serve as a stable, low-frequency lighting prior that guides the generation of a
high-quality final result. To generate high-dynamic-range (HDR) light probes,
an Exposure LoRA is fine-tuned to create LDR images at multiple exposure
values, which are then merged. While effective, DiffusionLight is
time-intensive, requiring approximately 30 minutes per estimation. To reduce
this overhead, we introduce DiffusionLight-Turbo, which reduces the runtime to
about 30 seconds with minimal quality loss. This 60x speedup is achieved by
training a Turbo LoRA to directly predict the averaged chrome balls from the
iterative process. Inference is further streamlined into a single denoising
pass using a LoRA swapping technique. Experimental results that show our method
produces convincing light estimates across diverse settings and demonstrates
superior generalization to in-the-wild scenarios. Our code is available at
https://diffusionlight.github.io/turbo

Abstract: Body dynamics are crucial information for the analysis of human motions in
important research fields, ranging from biomechanics, sports science to
computer vision and graphics. Modern approaches collect the body dynamics,
external reactive force specifically, via force plates, synchronizing with
human motion capture data, and learn to estimate the dynamics from a black-box
deep learning model. Being specialized devices, force plates can only be
installed in laboratory setups, imposing a significant limitation on the
learning of human dynamics. To this end, we propose a novel method for
estimating human ground reaction dynamics directly from the more reliable
motion capture data with physics laws and computational simulation as
constrains. We introduce a highly accurate and robust method for computing
ground reaction forces from motion capture data using Euler's integration
scheme and PD algorithm. The physics-based reactive forces are used to inform
the learning model about the physics-informed motion dynamics thus improving
the estimation accuracy. The proposed approach was tested on the GroundLink
dataset, outperforming the baseline model on: 1) the ground reaction force
estimation accuracy compared to the force plates measurement; and 2) our
simulated root trajectory precision. The implementation code is available at

### [12] [Learning Camera-Agnostic White-Balance Preferences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01342)
*Luxi Zhao,Mahmoud Afifi,Michael S. Brown*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种轻量级方法，通过学习后光照估计映射，将中性白平衡校正转换为美学偏好校正，实现跨相机美学一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 商业自动白平衡（AWB）系统通常追求美学偏好而非中性色彩校正，且现有学习型方法难以泛化到不同相机传感器。

Method: 提出一种后光照估计映射，将中性白平衡校正转换为美学偏好校正，模型轻量且高效。

Result: 在771张智能手机图像数据集上，方法表现优异，计算开销极低（0.024毫秒）。

Conclusion: 该方法首次实现跨相机美学一致性，兼容现有技术，且计算和内存开销极小。

Abstract: The image signal processor (ISP) pipeline in modern cameras consists of
several modules that transform raw sensor data into visually pleasing images in
a display color space. Among these, the auto white balance (AWB) module is
essential for compensating for scene illumination. However, commercial AWB
systems often strive to compute aesthetic white-balance preferences rather than
accurate neutral color correction. While learning-based methods have improved
AWB accuracy, they typically struggle to generalize across different camera
sensors -- an issue for smartphones with multiple cameras. Recent work has
explored cross-camera AWB, but most methods remain focused on achieving neutral
white balance. In contrast, this paper is the first to address aesthetic
consistency by learning a post-illuminant-estimation mapping that transforms
neutral illuminant corrections into aesthetically preferred corrections in a
camera-agnostic space. Once trained, our mapping can be applied after any
neutral AWB module to enable consistent and stylized color rendering across
unseen cameras. Our proposed model is lightweight -- containing only $\sim$500
parameters -- and runs in just 0.024 milliseconds on a typical flagship mobile
CPU. Evaluated on a dataset of 771 smartphone images from three different
cameras, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance while remaining fully
compatible with existing cross-camera AWB techniques, introducing minimal
computational and memory overhead.

*Andrei Jelea,Ahmed Nabil Belbachir,Marius Leordeanu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GTTA是一种通用的测试时间增强方法，适用于多种视觉和非视觉任务，通过扰动PCA子空间投影形成鲁棒集成，并通过自监督学习降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时间增强方法缺乏通用性，GTTA旨在提供一种适用于多种任务的通用解决方案。

Method: GTTA通过随机扰动PCA子空间投影形成集成，并引入自监督学习阶段以减少计算成本。

Result: GTTA在多种任务和数据集上表现优于现有方法，并在特定任务（如鲑鱼分割）中验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: GTTA是一种通用且高效的测试时间增强方法，适用于广泛任务，同时保持高精度。

Abstract: We introduce Generalized Test-Time Augmentation (GTTA), a highly effective
method for improving the performance of a trained model, which unlike other
existing Test-Time Augmentation approaches from the literature is general
enough to be used off-the-shelf for many vision and non-vision tasks, such as
classification, regression, image segmentation and object detection. By
applying a new general data transformation, that randomly perturbs multiple
times the PCA subspace projection of a test input, GTTA forms robust ensembles
at test time in which, due to sound statistical properties, the structural and
systematic noises in the initial input data is filtered out and final estimator
errors are reduced. Different from other existing methods, we also propose a
final self-supervised learning stage in which the ensemble output, acting as an
unsupervised teacher, is used to train the initial single student model, thus
reducing significantly the test time computational cost, at no loss in
accuracy. Our tests and comparisons to strong TTA approaches and SoTA models on
various vision and non-vision well-known datasets and tasks, such as image
classification and segmentation, speech recognition and house price prediction,
validate the generality of the proposed GTTA. Furthermore, we also prove its
effectiveness on the more specific real-world task of salmon segmentation and
detection in low-visibility underwater videos, for which we introduce
DeepSalmon, the largest dataset of its kind in the literature.

*Chaoxiang Cai,Longrong Yang,Kaibing Chen,Fan Yang,Xi Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种长尾分布感知路由器（LTDR），用于视觉语言混合专家（MoE）模型，解决了模态间分布差异和视觉尾部令牌激活问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MoE框架在视觉语言模型中依赖负载平衡机制，忽视了视觉和语言模态间的分布差异。

Method: 提出LTDR，包括模态特定路由策略和针对视觉尾部令牌的专家激活增强策略。

Result: 在多个基准测试中验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: LTDR通过模态感知路由和尾部令牌优化，提升了视觉语言MoE模型的性能。

Abstract: The mixture-of-experts (MoE), which replaces dense models with sparse
architectures, has gained attention in large vision-language models (LVLMs) for
achieving comparable performance with fewer activated parameters. Existing MoE
frameworks for LVLMs focus on token-to-expert routing (TER), encouraging
different experts to specialize in processing distinct tokens. However, these
frameworks often rely on the load balancing mechanism, overlooking the inherent
distributional differences between vision and language. To this end, we propose
a Long-Tailed Distribution-aware Router (LTDR) for vision-language TER,
tackling two challenges: (1) Distribution-aware router for modality-specific
routing. We observe that language TER follows a uniform distribution, whereas
vision TER exhibits a long-tailed distribution. This discrepancy necessitates
distinct routing strategies tailored to each modality. (2) Enhancing expert
activation for vision tail tokens. Recognizing the importance of vision tail
tokens, we introduce an oversampling-like strategy by increasing the number of
activated experts for these tokens. Experiments on extensive benchmarks
validate the effectiveness of our approach.

Result: 实验验证了PGA在多视角和复杂环境中的优越性和有效性。

Conclusion: PGA为物理对抗攻击提供了一种高效且鲁棒的解决方案，显著提升了对抗效果和适应性。

Abstract: Physical adversarial attack methods expose the vulnerabilities of deep neural
networks and pose a significant threat to safety-critical scenarios such as
autonomous driving. Camouflage-based physical attack is a more promising
approach compared to the patch-based attack, offering stronger adversarial
effectiveness in complex physical environments. However, most prior work relies
on mesh priors of the target object and virtual environments constructed by
simulators, which are time-consuming to obtain and inevitably differ from the
real world. Moreover, due to the limitations of the backgrounds in training
images, previous methods often fail to produce multi-view robust adversarial
camouflage and tend to fall into sub-optimal solutions. Due to these reasons,
prior work lacks adversarial effectiveness and robustness across diverse
viewpoints and physical environments. We propose a physical attack framework
based on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), named PGA, which provides rapid and
precise reconstruction with few images, along with photo-realistic rendering
capabilities. Our framework further enhances cross-view robustness and
adversarial effectiveness by preventing mutual and self-occlusion among
Gaussians and employing a min-max optimization approach that adjusts the
imaging background of each viewpoint, helping the algorithm filter out
non-robust adversarial features. Extensive experiments validate the
effectiveness and superiority of PGA. Our code is available

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的少样本奖励建模方法——激活奖励模型（Activation RMs），通过激活导向构建对齐的奖励信号，无需额外微调，优于现有方法，并在安全关键应用中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对齐大型语言模型（LLMs）和大型多模态模型（LMMs）到人类偏好是提升模型生成质量的关键，但传统奖励建模难以适应新偏好。

Method: 利用激活导向构建奖励信号，提出激活奖励模型（Activation RMs），并引入PreferenceHack基准测试奖励模型的抗奖励攻击能力。

Result: Activation RMs在标准奖励建模基准上优于现有少样本方法，并在PreferenceHack基准上超越GPT-4o。

Conclusion: Activation RMs是一种高效、灵活的少样本奖励建模方法，适用于安全关键应用。

Abstract: Aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) to
human preferences is a central challenge in improving the quality of the
models' generative outputs for real-world applications. A common approach is to
use reward modeling to encode preferences, enabling alignment via post-training
using reinforcement learning. However, traditional reward modeling is not
easily adaptable to new preferences because it requires a separate reward
model, commonly trained on large preference datasets. To address this, we
introduce Activation Reward Models (Activation RMs) -- a novel few-shot reward
modeling method that leverages activation steering to construct well-aligned
reward signals using minimal supervision and no additional model finetuning.
Activation RMs outperform existing few-shot reward modeling approaches such as
LLM-as-a-judge with in-context learning, voting-based scoring, and token
probability scoring on standard reward modeling benchmarks. Furthermore, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of Activation RMs in mitigating reward hacking
behaviors, highlighting their utility for safety-critical applications. Toward
this end, we propose PreferenceHack, a novel few-shot setting benchmark, the
first to test reward models on reward hacking in a paired preference format.
Finally, we show that Activation RM achieves state-of-the-art performance on
this benchmark, surpassing even GPT-4o.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为“主动测量”的人机协作AI框架，通过重要性采样优化科学测量，减少误差并提高效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI在科学发现中的工作流程缺乏足够的准确性和统计保证，需要一种更可靠的方法。

Method: 结合AI预测和人类标注，通过重要性采样迭代优化模型，并提供无偏的蒙特卡洛估计。

Result: 主动测量在多个测量任务中显著降低了估计误差，且对AI模型的准确性要求较低。

Conclusion: 主动测量是一种高效且可靠的科学测量方法，适用于需要精确统计的场景。

Abstract: AI has the potential to transform scientific discovery by analyzing vast
datasets with little human effort. However, current workflows often do not
provide the accuracy or statistical guarantees that are needed. We introduce
active measurement, a human-in-the-loop AI framework for scientific
measurement. An AI model is used to predict measurements for individual units,
which are then sampled for human labeling using importance sampling. With each
new set of human labels, the AI model is improved and an unbiased Monte Carlo
estimate of the total measurement is refined. Active measurement can provide
precise estimates even with an imperfect AI model, and requires little human
effort when the AI model is very accurate. We derive novel estimators,
weighting schemes, and confidence intervals, and show that active measurement
reduces estimation error compared to alternatives in several measurement tasks.

*Langyu Wang,Bingke Zhu,Yingying Chen,Yiyuan Zhang,Ming Tang,Jinqiao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于伪标签增强的音频视觉Mamba网络（MUG），用于改进弱监督音频视觉视频解析任务中的段级和事件级预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在弱监督和模型架构的限制下，难以同时提升段级和事件级预测性能。

Method: 通过伪标签增强生成新数据，并采用音频视觉Mamba网络（AV-Mamba）处理特征和交互，以增强段感知能力并排除模态噪声。

Result: 在LLP数据集上，MUG在所有指标上均优于现有方法（如视觉段级和音频段级指标分别提升2.1%和1.2%）。

Conclusion: MUG通过伪标签增强和AV-Mamba网络，显著提升了弱监督音频视觉视频解析的性能。

Abstract: The weakly-supervised audio-visual video parsing (AVVP) aims to predict all
modality-specific events and locate their temporal boundaries. Despite
significant progress, due to the limitations of the weakly-supervised and the
deficiencies of the model architecture, existing methods are lacking in
simultaneously improving both the segment-level prediction and the event-level
prediction. In this work, we propose a audio-visual Mamba network with pseudo
labeling aUGmentation (MUG) for emphasising the uniqueness of each segment and
excluding the noise interference from the alternate modalities. Specifically,
we annotate some of the pseudo-labels based on previous work. Using unimodal
pseudo-labels, we perform cross-modal random combinations to generate new data,
which can enhance the model's ability to parse various segment-level event
combinations. For feature processing and interaction, we employ a audio-visual
mamba network. The AV-Mamba enhances the ability to perceive different segments
and excludes additional modal noise while sharing similar modal information.
Our extensive experiments demonstrate that MUG improves state-of-the-art
results on LLP dataset in all metrics (e.g,, gains of 2.1% and 1.2% in terms of
visual Segment-level and audio Segment-level metrics). Our code is available at

Result: 实验表明FixTalk有效减少身份泄漏和伪影，性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FixTalk通过创新设计解决了说话头生成中的关键问题，表现优异。

Abstract: Talking head generation is gaining significant importance across various
domains, with a growing demand for high-quality rendering. However, existing
methods often suffer from identity leakage (IL) and rendering artifacts (RA),
particularly in extreme cases. Through an in-depth analysis of previous
approaches, we identify two key insights: (1) IL arises from identity
information embedded within motion features, and (2) this identity information
can be leveraged to address RA. Building on these findings, this paper
introduces FixTalk, a novel framework designed to simultaneously resolve both
issues for high-quality talking head generation. Firstly, we propose an
Enhanced Motion Indicator (EMI) to effectively decouple identity information
from motion features, mitigating the impact of IL on generated talking heads.
To address RA, we introduce an Enhanced Detail Indicator (EDI), which utilizes
the leaked identity information to supplement missing details, thus fixing the
artifacts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FixTalk effectively mitigates
IL and RA, achieving superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: 提出的建模方案有效提升了车道段和拓扑结构的预测性能。

Abstract: Most autonomous cars rely on the availability of high-definition (HD) maps.
Current research aims to address this constraint by directly predicting HD map
elements from onboard sensors and reasoning about the relationships between the
predicted map and traffic elements. Despite recent advancements, the coherent
online construction of HD maps remains a challenging endeavor, as it
necessitates modeling the high complexity of road topologies in a unified and
consistent manner. To address this challenge, we propose a coherent approach to
predict lane segments and their corresponding topology, as well as road
boundaries, all by leveraging prior map information represented by commonly
available standard-definition (SD) maps. We propose a network architecture,
which leverages hybrid lane segment encodings comprising prior information and
denoising techniques to enhance training stability and performance.
Furthermore, we facilitate past frames for temporal consistency. Our
experimental evaluation demonstrates that our approach outperforms previous
methods by a large margin, highlighting the benefits of our modeling scheme.

Motivation: 胎儿腹部畸形是严重的先天性异常，需准确诊断以指导妊娠管理。AI在医学诊断中潜力巨大，但应用于产前腹部异常的研究有限，现有方法多关注图像级分类而忽视病例级诊断。

Method: 采用混合注意力专家模块（MoAE）加权不同平面的注意力头；提出医学知识驱动的特征选择模块（MFS）对齐图像特征与医学知识；引入提示原型学习（PPL）增强MFS。

Result: 在包含2,419个病例和24,748张图像的大规模数据集上验证，方法优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 该方法在胎儿腹部异常分类中表现优异，为产前超声诊断提供了新思路。

Abstract: Fetal abdominal malformations are serious congenital anomalies that require
accurate diagnosis to guide pregnancy management and reduce mortality. Although
AI has demonstrated significant potential in medical diagnosis, its application
to prenatal abdominal anomalies remains limited. Most existing studies focus on
image-level classification and rely on standard plane localization, placing
less emphasis on case-level diagnosis. In this paper, we develop a case-level
multiple instance learning (MIL)-based method, free of standard plane
localization, for classifying fetal abdominal anomalies in prenatal ultrasound.
Our contribution is three-fold. First, we adopt a mixture-of-attention-experts
module (MoAE) to weight different attention heads for various planes. Secondly,
we propose a medical-knowledge-driven feature selection module (MFS) to align
image features with medical knowledge, performing self-supervised image token
selection at the case-level. Finally, we propose a prompt-based prototype
learning (PPL) to enhance the MFS. Extensively validated on a large prenatal
abdominal ultrasound dataset containing 2,419 cases, with a total of 24,748
images and 6 categories, our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art
competitors. Codes are available at:https://github.com/LL-AC/AAcls.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出CaptionSmiths方法，通过量化标题属性并插值端点向量，实现灵活控制生成标题的语言模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像标题生成模型难以精细控制标题属性（如长度、描述性），因其未在训练中引入这些条件且无法平滑切换语言模式。

Method: 量化标题的三种属性（长度、描述性、词汇独特性）为连续标量值，通过插值端点向量实现条件控制。

Result: 模型能平滑调整标题属性，词汇对齐优于基线，例如长度控制误差减少506%。

Conclusion: CaptionSmiths方法有效解决了标题生成中语言模式灵活控制的问题。

Abstract: An image captioning model flexibly switching its language pattern, e.g.,
descriptiveness and length, should be useful since it can be applied to diverse
applications. However, despite the dramatic improvement in generative
vision-language models, fine-grained control over the properties of generated
captions is not easy due to two reasons: (i) existing models are not given the
properties as a condition during training and (ii) existing models cannot
smoothly transition its language pattern from one state to the other. Given
this challenge, we propose a new approach, CaptionSmiths, to acquire a single
captioning model that can handle diverse language patterns. First, our approach
quantifies three properties of each caption, length, descriptiveness, and
uniqueness of a word, as continuous scalar values, without human annotation.
Given the values, we represent the conditioning via interpolation between two
endpoint vectors corresponding to the extreme states, e.g., one for a very
short caption and one for a very long caption. Empirical results demonstrate
that the resulting model can smoothly change the properties of the output
captions and show higher lexical alignment than baselines. For instance,
CaptionSmiths reduces the error in controlling caption length by 506\% despite
better lexical alignment. Code will be available on

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于梯度方向的OOD检测方法，通过短路异常梯度来提升检测效果，同时保持ID分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在开放世界中，OOD检测对模型安全部署至关重要。观察到ID和OOD样本的梯度方向差异，激发了通过梯度短路提升OOD检测的动机。

Method: 提出了一种推理阶段技术，短路异常梯度，并引入局部一阶近似以避免二次前向传播。

Result: 在标准OOD基准测试中表现显著提升，方法轻量且对标准推理流程改动小。

Conclusion: 该方法为实际应用中的鲁棒OOD检测提供了实用路径。

Abstract: Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection is critical for safely deploying deep
models in open-world environments, where inputs may lie outside the training
distribution. During inference on a model trained exclusively with
In-Distribution (ID) data, we observe a salient gradient phenomenon: around an
ID sample, the local gradient directions for "enhancing" that sample's
predicted class remain relatively consistent, whereas OOD samples--unseen in
training--exhibit disorganized or conflicting gradient directions in the same
neighborhood. Motivated by this observation, we propose an inference-stage
technique to short-circuit those feature coordinates that spurious gradients
exploit to inflate OOD confidence, while leaving ID classification largely
intact. To circumvent the expense of recomputing the logits after this gradient
short-circuit, we further introduce a local first-order approximation that
accurately captures the post-modification outputs without a second forward
pass. Experiments on standard OOD benchmarks show our approach yields
substantial improvements. Moreover, the method is lightweight and requires
minimal changes to the standard inference pipeline, offering a practical path
toward robust OOD detection in real-world applications.

Motivation: 现有方法通常仅能处理恒定颜色背景的阴影，而忽略了彩色阴影，因此需要一种更有效的方法。

Result: 在三个公共数据集上的实验验证了该方法的优越性。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在文档图像阴影去除任务中表现优于现有技术，代码和数据集将公开。

Abstract: Document shadow removal is a crucial task in the field of document image
enhancement. However, existing methods tend to remove shadows with constant
color background and ignore color shadows. In this paper, we first design a
diffusion model in latent space for document image shadow removal, called
DocShaDiffusion. It translates shadow images from pixel space to latent space,
enabling the model to more easily capture essential features. To address the
issue of color shadows, we design a shadow soft-mask generation module (SSGM).
It is able to produce accurate shadow mask and add noise into shadow regions
specially. Guided by the shadow mask, a shadow mask-aware guided diffusion
module (SMGDM) is proposed to remove shadows from document images by
supervising the diffusion and denoising process. We also propose a
shadow-robust perceptual feature loss to preserve details and structures in
document images. Moreover, we develop a large-scale synthetic document color
shadow removal dataset (SDCSRD). It simulates the distribution of realistic
color shadows and provides powerful supports for the training of models.
Experiments on three public datasets validate the proposed method's superiority
over state-of-the-art. Our code and dataset will be publicly available.

Motivation: Deepfake技术对安全和隐私构成威胁，现有水印方法在对抗Deepfake操作时鲁棒性不足。

Method: DiffMark通过时间步依赖的面部条件权重和交叉信息融合模块（CIF）整合水印特征，并利用冻结自编码器和Deepfake抗性指导增强鲁棒性。

Result: 实验证明DiffMark在典型Deepfake操作中表现有效。

Conclusion: DiffMark为对抗Deepfake提供了一种鲁棒的水印解决方案。

Abstract: Deepfakes pose significant security and privacy threats through malicious
facial manipulations. While robust watermarking can aid in authenticity
verification and source tracking, existing methods often lack the sufficient
robustness against Deepfake manipulations. Diffusion models have demonstrated
remarkable performance in image generation, enabling the seamless fusion of
watermark with image during generation. In this study, we propose a novel
robust watermarking framework based on diffusion model, called DiffMark. By
modifying the training and sampling scheme, we take the facial image and
watermark as conditions to guide the diffusion model to progressively denoise
and generate corresponding watermarked image. In the construction of facial
condition, we weight the facial image by a timestep-dependent factor that
gradually reduces the guidance intensity with the decrease of noise, thus
better adapting to the sampling process of diffusion model. To achieve the
fusion of watermark condition, we introduce a cross information fusion (CIF)
module that leverages a learnable embedding table to adaptively extract
watermark features and integrates them with image features via cross-attention.
To enhance the robustness of the watermark against Deepfake manipulations, we
integrate a frozen autoencoder during training phase to simulate Deepfake
manipulations. Additionally, we introduce Deepfake-resistant guidance that
employs specific Deepfake model to adversarially guide the diffusion sampling
process to generate more robust watermarked images. Experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DiffMark on typical Deepfakes.

Method: 定义轻量级TurboClique（3-团）和并行化PGS算法，通过高SC$^2$分数匹配对引导搜索。

Result: 在多个数据集上达到SOTA性能，速度提升显著（如3DMatch+FCGF数据集上快208.22倍）。

Conclusion: TurboReg在速度和鲁棒性上均优于现有方法，适用于实时PCR应用。

Abstract: Robust estimation is essential in correspondence-based Point Cloud
Registration (PCR). Existing methods using maximal clique search in
compatibility graphs achieve high recall but suffer from exponential time
complexity, limiting their use in time-sensitive applications. To address this
challenge, we propose a fast and robust estimator, TurboReg, built upon a novel
lightweight clique, TurboClique, and a highly parallelizable Pivot-Guided
Search (PGS) algorithm. First, we define the TurboClique as a 3-clique within a
highly-constrained compatibility graph. The lightweight nature of the 3-clique
allows for efficient parallel searching, and the highly-constrained
compatibility graph ensures robust spatial consistency for stable
transformation estimation. Next, PGS selects matching pairs with high SC$^2$
scores as pivots, effectively guiding the search toward TurboCliques with
higher inlier ratios. Moreover, the PGS algorithm has linear time complexity
and is significantly more efficient than the maximal clique search with
exponential time complexity. Extensive experiments show that TurboReg achieves
state-of-the-art performance across multiple real-world datasets, with
substantial speed improvements. For example, on the 3DMatch+FCGF dataset,
TurboReg (1K) operates $208.22\times$ faster than 3DMAC while also achieving
higher recall. Our code is accessible at

Conclusion: OoDDINO通过多级策略有效解决了异常分割中的关键挑战，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Anomaly segmentation aims to identify Out-of-Distribution (OoD) anomalous
objects within images. Existing pixel-wise methods typically assign anomaly
scores individually and employ a global thresholding strategy to segment
anomalies. Despite their effectiveness, these approaches encounter significant
challenges in real-world applications: (1) neglecting spatial correlations
among pixels within the same object, resulting in fragmented segmentation; (2)
variabil ity in anomaly score distributions across image regions, causing
global thresholds to either generate false positives in background areas or
miss segments of anomalous objects. In this work, we introduce OoDDINO, a novel
multi-level anomaly segmentation framework designed to address these
limitations through a coarse-to-fine anomaly detection strategy. OoDDINO
combines an uncertainty-guided anomaly detection model with a pixel-level
segmentation model within a two-stage cascade architecture. Initially, we
propose an Orthogonal Uncertainty-Aware Fusion Strategy (OUAFS) that
sequentially integrates multiple uncertainty metrics with visual
representations, employing orthogonal constraints to strengthen the detection
model's capacity for localizing anomalous regions accurately. Subsequently, we
develop an Adaptive Dual-Threshold Network (ADT-Net), which dynamically
generates region-specific thresholds based on object-level detection outputs
and pixel-wise anomaly scores. This approach allows for distinct thresholding
strategies within foreground and background areas, achieving fine-grained
anomaly segmentation. The proposed framework is compatible with other
pixel-wise anomaly detection models, which acts as a plug-in to boost the
performance. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets validate our
framework's superiority and compatibility over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: 端到端强化学习在图像目标导航中具有潜力，但需注意模拟器设置的影响，并进一步优化架构以提高迁移能力。

Abstract: Image goal navigation requires two different skills: firstly, core navigation
skills, including the detection of free space and obstacles, and taking
decisions based on an internal representation; and secondly, computing
directional information by comparing visual observations to the goal image.
Current state-of-the-art methods either rely on dedicated image-matching, or
pre-training of computer vision modules on relative pose estimation. In this
paper, we study whether this task can be efficiently solved with end-to-end
training of full agents with RL, as has been claimed by recent work. A positive
answer would have impact beyond Embodied AI and allow training of relative pose
estimation from reward for navigation alone. In a large study we investigate
the effect of architectural choices like late fusion, channel stacking,
space-to-depth projections and cross-attention, and their role in the emergence
of relative pose estimators from navigation training. We show that the success
of recent methods is influenced up to a certain extent by simulator settings,
leading to shortcuts in simulation. However, we also show that these
capabilities can be transferred to more realistic setting, up to some extend.
We also find evidence for correlations between navigation performance and
probed (emerging) relative pose estimation performance, an important sub skill.

Abstract: Instance segmentation of novel objects instances in RGB images, given some
example images for each object, is a well known problem in computer vision.
Designing a model general enough to be employed, for all kinds of novel
objects, without (re-) training, has proven to be a difficult task. To handle
this, we propose a simple, yet powerful, framework, called: Novel Object Cyclic
Threshold based Instance Segmentation (NOCTIS). This work stems from and
improves upon previous ones like CNOS, SAM-6D and NIDS-Net; thus, it also
leverages on recent vision foundation models, namely: Grounded-SAM 2 and
DINOv2. It utilises Grounded-SAM 2 to obtain object proposals with precise
bounding boxes and their corresponding segmentation masks; while DINOv2's
zero-shot capabilities are employed to generate the image embeddings. The
quality of those masks, together with their embeddings, is of vital importance
to our approach; as the proposal-object matching is realized by determining an
object matching score based on the similarity of the class embeddings and the
average maximum similarity of the patch embeddings. Differently to SAM-6D,
calculating the latter involves a prior patch filtering based on the distance
between each patch and its corresponding cyclic/roundtrip patch in the image
grid. Furthermore, the average confidence of the proposals' bounding box and
mask is used as an additional weighting factor for the object matching score.
We empirically show that NOCTIS, without further training/fine tuning,
outperforms the best RGB and RGB-D methods on the seven core datasets of the
BOP 2023 challenge for the "Model-based 2D segmentation of unseen objects"
task.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为REG的方法，通过将低层图像潜在表示与预训练模型的高层类别标记结合，显著提升了扩散模型的生成质量和训练效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如REPA）在扩散模型中利用外部视觉表示时，未能充分利用判别性表示，尤其是在去噪推理过程中缺乏外部对齐。

Method: REG方法通过将低层图像潜在表示与预训练基础模型的单一高层类别标记结合，实现了图像生成与全局语义的同步重建。

Result: 在ImageNet 256×256上，SiT-XL/2 + REG实现了63倍和23倍于SiT-XL/2和SiT-XL/2 + REPA的训练加速，且仅需400K次迭代即可超越4M次迭代的SiT-XL/2 + REPA。

Conclusion: REG方法在生成质量和训练效率上取得了显著提升，且推理开销几乎可忽略不计。

Abstract: REPA and its variants effectively mitigate training challenges in diffusion
models by incorporating external visual representations from pretrained models,
through alignment between the noisy hidden projections of denoising networks
and foundational clean image representations. We argue that the external
alignment, which is absent during the entire denoising inference process, falls
short of fully harnessing the potential of discriminative representations. In
this work, we propose a straightforward method called Representation
Entanglement for Generation (REG), which entangles low-level image latents with
a single high-level class token from pretrained foundation models for
denoising. REG acquires the capability to produce coherent image-class pairs
directly from pure noise, substantially improving both generation quality and
training efficiency. This is accomplished with negligible additional inference
overhead, requiring only one single additional token for denoising (<0.5\%
increase in FLOPs and latency). The inference process concurrently reconstructs
both image latents and their corresponding global semantics, where the acquired
semantic knowledge actively guides and enhances the image generation process.
On ImageNet 256$\times$256, SiT-XL/2 + REG demonstrates remarkable convergence
acceleration, achieving $\textbf{63}\times$ and $\textbf{23}\times$ faster
training than SiT-XL/2 and SiT-XL/2 + REPA, respectively. More impressively,
SiT-L/2 + REG trained for merely 400K iterations outperforms SiT-XL/2 + REPA
trained for 4M iterations ($\textbf{10}\times$ longer). Code is available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种高效的甲烷泄漏检测方法，通过改进算法（Mag1c-SAS和CEM）和机器学习模型（U-Net、LinkNet），显著提升了计算速度，适合资源有限的星载硬件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 甲烷是强效温室气体，早期检测其泄漏对减缓气候变化至关重要。现有任务多为手动操作，效率低且易遗漏事件。星载检测因下行速率慢而受限，需低功耗算法。

Method: 测试了快速目标检测方法（ACE、CEM），并提出改进算法Mag1c-SAS。结合机器学习模型（U-Net、LinkNet）评估性能，并提出了三种波段选择策略。

Result: Mag1c-SAS和CEM在准确性和计算效率上表现优异，分别比原Mag1c快约100倍和230倍。其中一种波段选择策略在减少通道数的同时保持了准确性。

Conclusion: 研究为星载甲烷检测提供了高效低功耗解决方案，代码和数据已开源，为未来技术发展奠定基础。

Abstract: Methane is a potent greenhouse gas, and detecting its leaks early via
hyperspectral satellite imagery can help mitigate climate change. Meanwhile,
many existing missions operate in manual tasking regimes only, thus missing
potential events of interest. To overcome slow downlink rates cost-effectively,
onboard detection is a viable solution. However, traditional methane
enhancement methods are too computationally demanding for resource-limited
onboard hardware. This work accelerates methane detection by focusing on
efficient, low-power algorithms. We test fast target detection methods (ACE,
CEM) that have not been previously used for methane detection and propose a
Mag1c-SAS - a significantly faster variant of the current state-of-the-art
algorithm for methane detection: Mag1c. To explore their true detection
potential, we integrate them with a machine learning model (U-Net, LinkNet).
Our results identify two promising candidates (Mag1c-SAS and CEM), both
acceptably accurate for the detection of strong plumes and computationally
efficient enough for onboard deployment: one optimized more for accuracy, the
other more for speed, achieving up to ~100x and ~230x faster computation than
original Mag1c on resource-limited hardware. Additionally, we propose and
evaluate three band selection strategies. One of them can outperform the method
traditionally used in the field while using fewer channels, leading to even
faster processing without compromising accuracy. This research lays the
foundation for future advancements in onboard methane detection with minimal
hardware requirements, improving timely data delivery. The produced code, data,
and models are open-sourced and can be accessed from

Abstract: Visual pose tracking is playing an increasingly vital role in industrial
contexts in recent years. However, the pose tracking for industrial metal
objects remains a challenging task especially in the real world-environments,
due to the reflection characteristic of metal objects. To address this issue,
we propose a novel 6DoF pose tracking method based on active control points.
The method uses image control points to generate edge feature for optimization
actively instead of 6DoF pose-based rendering, and serve them as optimization
variables. We also introduce an optimal control point regression method to
improve robustness. The proposed tracking method performs effectively in both
dataset evaluation and real world tasks, providing a viable solution for
real-time tracking of industrial metal objects. Our source code is made

Abstract: High-definition (HD) map construction methods are crucial for providing
precise and comprehensive static environmental information, which is essential
for autonomous driving systems. While Camera-LiDAR fusion techniques have shown
promising results by integrating data from both modalities, existing approaches
primarily focus on improving model accuracy and often neglect the robustness of
perception models, which is a critical aspect for real-world applications. In
this paper, we explore strategies to enhance the robustness of multi-modal
fusion methods for HD map construction while maintaining high accuracy. We
propose three key components: data augmentation, a novel multi-modal fusion
module, and a modality dropout training strategy. These components are
evaluated on a challenging dataset containing 10 days of NuScenes data. Our
experimental results demonstrate that our proposed methods significantly
enhance the robustness of baseline methods. Furthermore, our approach achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the clean validation set of the NuScenes
dataset. Our findings provide valuable insights for developing more robust and
reliable HD map construction models, advancing their applicability in
real-world autonomous driving scenarios. Project website:

Abstract: Although video multimodal large language models (video MLLMs) have achieved
substantial progress in video captioning tasks, it remains challenging to
adjust the focal emphasis of video captions according to human preferences. To
address this limitation, we propose Aligned Video Captioning via Direct
Preference Optimization (AVC-DPO), a post-training framework designed to
enhance captioning capabilities in video MLLMs through preference alignment.
Our approach designs enhanced prompts that specifically target temporal
dynamics and spatial information-two key factors that humans care about when
watching a video-thereby incorporating human-centric preferences. AVC-DPO
leverages the same foundation model's caption generation responses under varied
prompt conditions to conduct preference-aware training and caption alignment.
Using this framework, we have achieved exceptional performance in the
LOVE@CVPR'25 Workshop Track 1A: Video Detailed Captioning Challenge, achieving
first place on the Video Detailed Captioning (VDC) benchmark according to the

Conclusion: 该方法在无需训练和掩码的情况下，显著提升了ReFlow的实际图像编辑能力。

Abstract: Rectified Flow text-to-image models surpass diffusion models in image quality
and text alignment, but adapting ReFlow for real-image editing remains
challenging. We propose a new real-image editing method for ReFlow by analyzing
the intermediate representations of multimodal transformer blocks and
identifying three key features. To extract these features from real images with
sufficient structural preservation, we leverage mid-step latent, which is
inverted only up to the mid-step. We then adapt attention during injection to
improve editability and enhance alignment to the target text. Our method is
training-free, requires no user-provided mask, and can be applied even without
a source prompt. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks with nine baselines
demonstrate its superior performance over prior methods, further validated by
human evaluations confirming a strong user preference for our approach.

Conclusion: 新型规则树冠检测方法在提升检测效果方面具有潜力，但仍需进一步优化。

Abstract: Global warming, loss of biodiversity, and air pollution are among the most
significant problems facing Earth. One of the primary challenges in addressing
these issues is the lack of monitoring forests to protect them. To tackle this
problem, it is important to leverage remote sensing and computer vision methods
to automate monitoring applications. Hence, automatic tree crown detection
algorithms emerged based on traditional and deep learning methods. In this
study, we first introduce two different tree crown detection methods based on
these approaches. Then, we form a novel rule-based approach that integrates
these two methods to enhance robustness and accuracy of tree crown detection
results. While traditional methods are employed for feature extraction and
segmentation of forested areas, deep learning methods are used to detect tree
crowns in our method. With the proposed rule-based approach, we post-process
these results, aiming to increase the number of detected tree crowns through
neighboring trees and localized operations. We compare the obtained results
with the proposed method in terms of the number of detected tree crowns and
report the advantages, disadvantages, and areas for improvement of the obtained
outcomes.

Abstract: The collection and release of street-level recordings as Open Data play a
vital role in advancing autonomous driving systems and AI research. However,
these datasets pose significant privacy risks, particularly for pedestrians,
due to the presence of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) that extends
beyond biometric traits such as faces. In this paper, we present cRID, a novel
cross-modal framework combining Large Vision-Language Models, Graph Attention
Networks, and representation learning to detect textual describable clues of
PII and enhance person re-identification (Re-ID). Our approach focuses on
identifying and leveraging interpretable features, enabling the detection of
semantically meaningful PII beyond low-level appearance cues. We conduct a
systematic evaluation of PII presence in person image datasets. Our experiments

Conclusion: SAM-MaGuP为息肉分割领域设定了新标准，解决了弱边界挑战。

Abstract: Polyp segmentation in colonoscopy images is crucial for early detection and
diagnosis of colorectal cancer. However, this task remains a significant
challenge due to the substantial variations in polyp shape, size, and color, as
well as the high similarity between polyps and surrounding tissues, often
compounded by indistinct boundaries. While existing encoder-decoder CNN and
transformer-based approaches have shown promising results, they struggle with
stable segmentation performance on polyps with weak or blurry boundaries. These
methods exhibit limited abilities to distinguish between polyps and non-polyps
and capture essential boundary cues. Moreover, their generalizability still
falls short of meeting the demands of real-time clinical applications. To
address these limitations, we propose SAM-MaGuP, a groundbreaking approach for
robust polyp segmentation. By incorporating a boundary distillation module and
a 1D-2D Mamba adapter within the Segment Anything Model (SAM), SAM-MaGuP excels
at resolving weak boundary challenges and amplifies feature learning through
enriched global contextual interactions. Extensive evaluations across five
diverse datasets reveal that SAM-MaGuP outperforms state-of-the-art methods,
achieving unmatched segmentation accuracy and robustness. Our key innovations,
a Mamba-guided boundary prior and a 1D-2D Mamba block, set a new benchmark in
the field, pushing the boundaries of polyp segmentation to new heights.

Abstract: The Vision Transformer (ViT) model has long struggled with the challenge of
quadratic complexity, a limitation that becomes especially critical in unmanned
aerial vehicle (UAV) tracking systems, where data must be processed in real
time. In this study, we explore the recently proposed State-Space Model, Mamba,
leveraging its computational efficiency and capability for long-sequence
modeling to effectively process dense image sequences in tracking tasks. First,
we highlight the issue of temporal inconsistency in existing Mamba-based
methods, specifically the failure to account for temporal continuity in the
Mamba scanning mechanism. Secondly, building upon this insight,we propose
TrackingMiM, a Mamba-in-Mamba architecture, a minimal-computation burden model
for handling image sequence of tracking problem. In our framework, the mamba
scan is performed in a nested way while independently process temporal and
spatial coherent patch tokens. While the template frame is encoded as query
token and utilized for tracking in every scan. Extensive experiments conducted
on five UAV tracking benchmarks confirm that the proposed TrackingMiM achieves
state-of-the-art precision while offering noticeable higher speed in UAV
tracking.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has introduced numerous opportunities for human
assistance and task automation in medicine. However, it suffers from poor
generalization in the presence of shifts in the data distribution. In the
context of AI-based computed tomography (CT) analysis, significant data
distribution shifts can be caused by changes in scanner manufacturer,
reconstruction technique or dose. AI harmonization techniques can address this
problem by reducing distribution shifts caused by various acquisition settings.
This paper presents an open-source benchmark dataset containing CT scans of an
anthropomorphic phantom acquired with various scanners and settings, which
purpose is to foster the development of AI harmonization techniques. Using a
phantom allows fixing variations attributed to inter- and intra-patient
variations. The dataset includes 1378 image series acquired with 13 scanners
from 4 manufacturers across 8 institutions using a harmonized protocol as well
as several acquisition doses. Additionally, we present a methodology, baseline
results and open-source code to assess image- and feature-level stability and
liver tissue classification, promoting the development of AI harmonization
strategies.

Conclusion: 结合判别式和生成式学习的IDGBR框架在遥感语义分割中实现了边界的高频特征优化。

Abstract: Remote sensing semantic segmentation must address both what the ground
objects are within an image and where they are located. Consequently,
segmentation models must ensure not only the semantic correctness of
large-scale patches (low-frequency information) but also the precise
localization of boundaries between patches (high-frequency information).
However, most existing approaches rely heavily on discriminative learning,
which excels at capturing low-frequency features, while overlooking its
inherent limitations in learning high-frequency features for semantic
segmentation. Recent studies have revealed that diffusion generative models
excel at generating high-frequency details. Our theoretical analysis confirms
that the diffusion denoising process significantly enhances the model's ability
to learn high-frequency features; however, we also observe that these models
exhibit insufficient semantic inference for low-frequency features when guided
solely by the original image. Therefore, we integrate the strengths of both
discriminative and generative learning, proposing the Integration of
Discriminative and diffusion-based Generative learning for Boundary Refinement
(IDGBR) framework. The framework first generates a coarse segmentation map
using a discriminative backbone model. This map and the original image are fed
into a conditioning guidance network to jointly learn a guidance representation
subsequently leveraged by an iterative denoising diffusion process refining the
coarse segmentation. Extensive experiments across five remote sensing semantic
segmentation datasets (binary and multi-class segmentation) confirm our
framework's capability of consistent boundary refinement for coarse results
from diverse discriminative architectures. The source code will be available at

TL;DR: SketchColour是一种基于扩散变换器（DiT）的2D动画草图着色方法，通过轻量级适配器和LoRA微调，显著减少参数和内存使用，并在性能上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统2D动画制作需要手工绘制和着色大量帧，耗时耗力，因此需要自动化工具提高效率。

Method: 采用扩散变换器（DiT）替代传统U-Net，结合轻量级通道连接适配器和LoRA微调，减少参数和内存占用。

Result: 在SAKUGA数据集上，SketchColour性能优于现有视频着色方法，且仅需一半训练数据，生成结果具有时间一致性和低伪影。

Conclusion: SketchColour提供了一种高效、低资源消耗的2D动画着色解决方案，显著提升生产效率。

Abstract: The production of high-quality 2D animation is highly labor-intensive
process, as animators are currently required to draw and color a large number
of frames by hand. We present SketchColour, the first sketch-to-colour pipeline
for 2D animation built on a diffusion transformer (DiT) backbone. By replacing
the conventional U-Net denoiser with a DiT-style architecture and injecting
sketch information via lightweight channel-concatenation adapters accompanied
with LoRA finetuning, our method natively integrates conditioning without the
parameter and memory bloat of a duplicated ControlNet, greatly reducing
parameter count and GPU memory usage. Evaluated on the SAKUGA dataset,
SketchColour outperforms previous state-of-the-art video colourization methods
across all metrics, despite using only half the training data of competing
models. Our approach produces temporally coherent animations with minimal
artifacts such as colour bleeding or object deformation. Our code is available

Result: 实验表明，该方法为去噪网络增加了可控性并提升了性能。

Conclusion: 通过相机参数实现可控去噪，为去噪网络提供了新的优化方向。

Abstract: Recent deep learning-based image denoising methods have shown impressive
performance; however, many lack the flexibility to adjust the denoising
strength based on the noise levels, camera settings, and user preferences. In
this paper, we introduce a new controllable denoising framework that adaptively
removes noise from images by utilizing information from camera parameters.
Specifically, we focus on ISO, shutter speed, and F-number, which are closely
related to noise levels. We convert these selected parameters into a vector to
control and enhance the performance of the denoising network. Experimental
results show that our method seamlessly adds controllability to standard
denoising neural networks and improves their performance. Code is available at

TL;DR: DepthSync提出了一种无需训练的框架，通过扩散引导实现长视频的尺度和几何一致性深度预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理长视频时存在尺度不一致和几何不一致的问题，主要依赖2D扩散先验而忽略了3D几何结构。

Method: 引入尺度引导和几何引导，分别同步窗口间的深度尺度和窗口内的几何对齐，协同指导去噪过程。

Result: 实验表明，DepthSync在多个数据集上显著提升了深度预测的尺度和几何一致性，尤其适用于长视频。

Conclusion: DepthSync通过结合尺度和几何引导，有效解决了长视频深度预测中的一致性问题。

Abstract: Diffusion-based video depth estimation methods have achieved remarkable
success with strong generalization ability. However, predicting depth for long
videos remains challenging. Existing methods typically split videos into
overlapping sliding windows, leading to accumulated scale discrepancies across
different windows, particularly as the number of windows increases.
Additionally, these methods rely solely on 2D diffusion priors, overlooking the
inherent 3D geometric structure of video depths, which results in geometrically
inconsistent predictions. In this paper, we propose DepthSync, a novel,
training-free framework using diffusion guidance to achieve scale- and
geometry-consistent depth predictions for long videos. Specifically, we
introduce scale guidance to synchronize the depth scale across windows and
geometry guidance to enforce geometric alignment within windows based on the
inherent 3D constraints in video depths. These two terms work synergistically,
steering the denoising process toward consistent depth predictions. Experiments
on various datasets validate the effectiveness of our method in producing depth
estimates with improved scale and geometry consistency, particularly for long
videos.

Motivation: 深度学习人脸识别系统的广泛应用引发了安全隐患，但现有研究对真实场景中的后门攻击关注不足。

Method: 通过探索DNN后门在整个人脸识别流程中的可行性，提出了两种新型攻击（人脸生成和关键点偏移），并测试了20种流程配置和15种攻击案例。

Result: 研究表明，单一后门攻击可绕过系统功能，且基于大间隔损失的特征提取器也易受攻击。

Conclusion: 研究填补了文献空白，并为相关方提供了最佳实践和防御措施。

Abstract: The widespread use of deep learning face recognition raises several security
concerns. Although prior works point at existing vulnerabilities, DNN backdoor
attacks against real-life, unconstrained systems dealing with images captured
in the wild remain a blind spot of the literature. This paper conducts the
first system-level study of backdoors in deep learning-based face recognition
systems. This paper yields four contributions by exploring the feasibility of
DNN backdoors on these pipelines in a holistic fashion. We demonstrate for the
first time two backdoor attacks on the face detection task: face generation and
face landmark shift attacks. We then show that face feature extractors trained
with large margin losses also fall victim to backdoor attacks. Combining our
models, we then show using 20 possible pipeline configurations and 15 attack
cases that a single backdoor enables an attacker to bypass the entire function
of a system. Finally, we provide stakeholders with several best practices and
countermeasures.

TL;DR: POLC提出了一种感知导向的潜在编码方法，通过丰富潜在特征的语义内容，提升压缩域语义推理性能，同时减少微调参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MSE优化的潜在空间语义贫乏，且全模型微调计算成本高。

Method: 提出POLC方法，通过感知导向优化潜在编码，仅需插件式适配器微调。

Result: POLC在保持率感知性能的同时，显著提升视觉任务性能，微调开销极小。

Conclusion: POLC为压缩域语义推理提供了一种高效且高性能的解决方案。

Abstract: In recent years, compressed domain semantic inference has primarily relied on
learned image coding models optimized for mean squared error (MSE). However,
MSE-oriented optimization tends to yield latent spaces with limited semantic
richness, which hinders effective semantic inference in downstream tasks.
Moreover, achieving high performance with these models often requires
fine-tuning the entire vision model, which is computationally intensive,
especially for large models. To address these problems, we introduce
Perception-Oriented Latent Coding (POLC), an approach that enriches the
semantic content of latent features for high-performance compressed domain
semantic inference. With the semantically rich latent space, POLC requires only
a plug-and-play adapter for fine-tuning, significantly reducing the parameter
count compared to previous MSE-oriented methods. Experimental results
demonstrate that POLC achieves rate-perception performance comparable to
state-of-the-art generative image coding methods while markedly enhancing
performance in vision tasks, with minimal fine-tuning overhead. Code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的人体-物体接触检测模型在单一图像类型上表现受限，导致区域分割过多且类别一致性差。

Method: P3HOT框架结合语义驱动的提示机制和人类近端感知机制，动态感知关键深度范围，并引入区域联合损失（RJLoss）和新评估指标AD-Acc。

Result: 在HOT-Annotated数据集上，P3HOT在SC-Acc.、mIoU、wIoU和AD-Acc.指标上分别提升了0.7、2.0、1.6和11.0。

Conclusion: P3HOT通过多机制融合和新损失函数，显著提升了人体-物体接触检测的性能，为相关任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: The task of Human-Object conTact (HOT) detection involves identifying the
specific areas of the human body that are touching objects. Nevertheless,
current models are restricted to just one type of image, often leading to too
much segmentation in areas with little interaction, and struggling to maintain
category consistency within specific regions. To tackle this issue, a HOT
framework, termed \textbf{P3HOT}, is proposed, which blends \textbf{P}rompt
guidance and human \textbf{P}roximal \textbf{P}erception. To begin with, we
utilize a semantic-driven prompt mechanism to direct the network's attention
towards the relevant regions based on the correlation between image and text.
Then a human proximal perception mechanism is employed to dynamically perceive
key depth range around the human, using learnable parameters to effectively
eliminate regions where interactions are not expected. Calculating depth
resolves the uncertainty of the overlap between humans and objects in a 2D
perspective, providing a quasi-3D viewpoint. Moreover, a Regional Joint Loss
(RJLoss) has been created as a new loss to inhibit abnormal categories in the
same area. A new evaluation metric called ``AD-Acc.'' is introduced to address
the shortcomings of existing methods in addressing negative samples.
Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves
state-of-the-art performance in four metrics across two benchmark datasets.
Specifically, our model achieves an improvement of \textbf{0.7}$\uparrow$,
\textbf{2.0}$\uparrow$, \textbf{1.6}$\uparrow$, and \textbf{11.0}$\uparrow$ in
SC-Acc., mIoU, wIoU, and AD-Acc. metrics, respectively, on the HOT-Annotated
dataset. Code is available at https://github.com/YuxiaoWang-AI/P3HOT.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有NeRF方法因内存限制仅适用于小场景，本文旨在解决大场景3D重建问题。

Method: 采用分块策略（3D tile）和重叠裁剪图像，结合2×2 3D tile进展策略和分段采样器，避免边缘重建错误。

Result: 实验表明，Snake-NeRF能在单GPU上线性时间处理大卫星图像，且质量无损。

Conclusion: Snake-NeRF成功扩展了NeRF的应用范围，适用于大场景3D重建。

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have recently emerged as a paradigm for 3D
reconstruction from multiview satellite imagery. However, state-of-the-art NeRF
methods are typically constrained to small scenes due to the memory footprint
during training, which we study in this paper. Previous work on large-scale
NeRFs palliate this by dividing the scene into NeRFs. This paper introduces
Snake-NeRF, a framework that scales to large scenes. Our out-of-core method
eliminates the need to load all images and networks simultaneously, and
operates on a single device. We achieve this by dividing the region of interest
into NeRFs that 3D tile without overlap. Importantly, we crop the images with
overlap to ensure each NeRFs is trained with all the necessary pixels. We
introduce a novel $2\times 2$ 3D tile progression strategy and segmented
sampler, which together prevent 3D reconstruction errors along the tile edges.
Our experiments conclude that large satellite images can effectively be
processed with linear time complexity, on a single GPU, and without compromise
in quality.

Motivation: 现有基础MDE模型在复杂开放世界环境中表现不佳，尤其是在光照变化、恶劣天气和传感器失真等挑战性条件下。

Method: 提出无监督一致性正则化微调范式和空间距离约束，以学习补丁级相对关系。

Result: 实验表明，DepthAnything-AC在多种基准测试（包括恶劣天气和合成损坏）中具有零样本能力。

Conclusion: DepthAnything-AC在复杂环境条件下表现出色，解决了数据稀缺和伪标签生成问题。

Abstract: We present Depth Anything at Any Condition (DepthAnything-AC), a foundation
monocular depth estimation (MDE) model capable of handling diverse
environmental conditions. Previous foundation MDE models achieve impressive
performance across general scenes but not perform well in complex open-world
environments that involve challenging conditions, such as illumination
variations, adverse weather, and sensor-induced distortions. To overcome the
challenges of data scarcity and the inability of generating high-quality
pseudo-labels from corrupted images, we propose an unsupervised consistency
regularization finetuning paradigm that requires only a relatively small amount
of unlabeled data. Furthermore, we propose the Spatial Distance Constraint to
explicitly enforce the model to learn patch-level relative relationships,
resulting in clearer semantic boundaries and more accurate details.
Experimental results demonstrate the zero-shot capabilities of DepthAnything-AC
across diverse benchmarks, including real-world adverse weather benchmarks,
synthetic corruption benchmarks, and general benchmarks.

Motivation: 现有ViT在图像-文本对比学习或自监督机制中表现优异，但与LLM直接联合训练时存在参数初始化冲突和模态语义差距，限制了MLLM的性能。

Method: 提出SAILViT，通过逐步特征细化实现从粗到细的特征对齐和世界知识注入，适应目标训练需求。

Result: SAILViT在不同参数规模、架构、训练策略和数据规模下均表现出强大的鲁棒性和泛化能力，显著提升了MLLM在OpenCompass基准测试中的性能。

Conclusion: SAILViT有效解决了ViT与LLM联合训练的挑战，为MLLM在多模态任务中的性能提升提供了新思路。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) are essential as foundation backbones in
establishing the visual comprehension capabilities of Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs). Although most ViTs achieve impressive performance through
image-text pair-based contrastive learning or self-supervised mechanisms, they
struggle to engage in connector-based co-training directly with LLMs due to
potential parameter initialization conflicts and modality semantic gaps. To
address the above challenges, this paper proposes SAILViT, a gradual feature
learning-enhanced ViT for facilitating MLLMs to break through performance
bottlenecks in complex multimodal interactions. SAILViT achieves
coarse-to-fine-grained feature alignment and world knowledge infusion with
gradual feature refinement, which better serves target training demands. We
perform thorough empirical analyses to confirm the powerful robustness and
generalizability of SAILViT across different dimensions, including parameter
sizes, model architectures, training strategies, and data scales. Equipped with
SAILViT, existing MLLMs show significant and consistent performance
improvements on the OpenCompass benchmark across extensive downstream tasks.

Motivation: 现有AR模型依赖Transformer架构，计算复杂度和内存开销大；线性注意力虽能降低负担，但在图像生成中因无法捕捉长程依赖而性能下降。

Method: 提出LASAD机制，通过基于真实2D空间位置的位置相关衰减因子保留空间关系，构建LASADGen生成器。

Result: 在ImageNet上，LASADGen实现了高效的线性复杂度和高质量的图像生成性能。

Conclusion: LASADGen成功平衡了线性注意力的效率与高质量图像生成所需的空间理解能力。

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models have garnered significant attention in image
generation for their ability to effectively capture both local and global
structures within visual data. However, prevalent AR models predominantly rely
on the transformer architectures, which are beset by quadratic computational
complexity concerning input sequence length and substantial memory overhead due
to the necessity of maintaining key-value caches. Although linear attention
mechanisms have successfully reduced this burden in language models, our
initial experiments reveal that they significantly degrade image generation
quality because of their inability to capture critical long-range dependencies
in visual data. We propose Linear Attention with Spatial-Aware Decay (LASAD), a
novel attention mechanism that explicitly preserves genuine 2D spatial
relationships within the flattened image sequences by computing
position-dependent decay factors based on true 2D spatial location rather than
1D sequence positions. Based on this mechanism, we present LASADGen, an
autoregressive image generator that enables selective attention to relevant
spatial contexts with linear complexity. Experiments on ImageNet show LASADGen
achieves state-of-the-art image generation performance and computational
efficiency, bridging the gap between linear attention's efficiency and spatial
understanding needed for high-quality generation.

Result: 实验表明，RobuSTereo显著提升了模型在多种恶劣天气条件下的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: RobuSTereo通过数据增强和特征提取优化，有效解决了立体匹配模型在恶劣天气下的性能问题。

Abstract: Learning-based stereo matching models struggle in adverse weather conditions
due to the scarcity of corresponding training data and the challenges in
extracting discriminative features from degraded images. These limitations
significantly hinder zero-shot generalization to out-of-distribution weather
conditions. In this paper, we propose \textbf{RobuSTereo}, a novel framework
that enhances the zero-shot generalization of stereo matching models under
adverse weather by addressing both data scarcity and feature extraction
challenges. First, we introduce a diffusion-based simulation pipeline with a
stereo consistency module, which generates high-quality stereo data tailored
for adverse conditions. By training stereo matching models on our synthetic
datasets, we reduce the domain gap between clean and degraded images,
significantly improving the models' robustness to unseen weather conditions.
The stereo consistency module ensures structural alignment across synthesized
image pairs, preserving geometric integrity and enhancing depth estimation
accuracy. Second, we design a robust feature encoder that combines a
specialized ConvNet with a denoising transformer to extract stable and reliable
features from degraded images. The ConvNet captures fine-grained local
structures, while the denoising transformer refines global representations,
effectively mitigating the impact of noise, low visibility, and weather-induced
distortions. This enables more accurate disparity estimation even under
challenging visual conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
\textbf{RobuSTereo} significantly improves the robustness and generalization of
stereo matching models across diverse adverse weather scenarios.

Result: 实验显示，理想的子像素标记定位可大幅提升性能并减少标记数量。

Conclusion: SPoT为ViT架构提供了灵活、高效且可解释的新方向，将稀疏性转化为优势。

Abstract: Vision Transformers naturally accommodate sparsity, yet standard tokenization
methods confine features to discrete patch grids. This constraint prevents
models from fully exploiting sparse regimes, forcing awkward compromises. We
propose Subpixel Placement of Tokens (SPoT), a novel tokenization strategy that
positions tokens continuously within images, effectively sidestepping
grid-based limitations. With our proposed oracle-guided search, we uncover
substantial performance gains achievable with ideal subpixel token positioning,
drastically reducing the number of tokens necessary for accurate predictions
during inference. SPoT provides a new direction for flexible, efficient, and
interpretable ViT architectures, redefining sparsity as a strategic advantage
rather than an imposed limitation.

Conclusion: FACET-VLM为多模态面部表情识别提供了强大、可扩展且高性能的解决方案。

Abstract: Facial expression recognition (FER) in 3D and 4D domains presents a
significant challenge in affective computing due to the complexity of spatial
and temporal facial dynamics. Its success is crucial for advancing applications
in human behavior understanding, healthcare monitoring, and human-computer
interaction. In this work, we propose FACET-VLM, a vision-language framework
for 3D/4D FER that integrates multiview facial representation learning with
semantic guidance from natural language prompts. FACET-VLM introduces three key
components: Cross-View Semantic Aggregation (CVSA) for view-consistent fusion,
Multiview Text-Guided Fusion (MTGF) for semantically aligned facial emotions,
and a multiview consistency loss to enforce structural coherence across views.
Our model achieves state-of-the-art accuracy across multiple benchmarks,
including BU-3DFE, Bosphorus, BU-4DFE, and BP4D-Spontaneous. We further extend
FACET-VLM to 4D micro-expression recognition (MER) on the 4DME dataset,
demonstrating strong performance in capturing subtle, short-lived emotional
cues. The extensive experimental results confirm the effectiveness and
substantial contributions of each individual component within the framework.
Overall, FACET-VLM offers a robust, extensible, and high-performing solution
for multimodal FER in both posed and spontaneous settings.

Result: 在公开和细粒度数据集上的实验验证了AdaGCD的有效性，尤其在利用空间局部信息方面表现突出。

Conclusion: AdaGCD通过自适应表示和动态槽分配，显著提升了开放世界场景中的类别发现能力。

Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) tackles the challenging problem of
categorizing unlabeled images into both known and novel classes within a
partially labeled dataset, without prior knowledge of the number of unknown
categories. Traditional methods often rely on rigid assumptions, such as
predefining the number of classes, which limits their ability to handle the
inherent variability and complexity of real-world data. To address these
shortcomings, we propose AdaGCD, a cluster-centric contrastive learning
framework that incorporates Adaptive Slot Attention (AdaSlot) into the GCD
framework. AdaSlot dynamically determines the optimal number of slots based on
data complexity, removing the need for predefined slot counts. This adaptive
mechanism facilitates the flexible clustering of unlabeled data into known and
novel categories by dynamically allocating representational capacity. By
integrating adaptive representation with dynamic slot allocation, our method
captures both instance-specific and spatially clustered features, improving
class discovery in open-world scenarios. Extensive experiments on public and
fine-grained datasets validate the effectiveness of our framework, emphasizing
the advantages of leveraging spatial local information for category discovery
in unlabeled image datasets.

Abstract: Camera fingerprint detection plays a crucial role in source identification
and image forensics, with wavelet denoising approaches proving to be
particularly effective in extracting sensor pattern noise (SPN). In this
article, we propose a modification to wavelet-based SPN extraction. Rather than
constructing the fingerprint as an image, we introduce the notion of a wavelet
domain fingerprint. This avoids the final inversion step of the denoising
algorithm and allows fingerprint comparisons to be made directly in the wavelet
domain. As such, our modification streamlines the extraction and comparison
process. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that our
method not only achieves higher detection accuracy but can also significantly
improve processing speed.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于软自标记的弱监督分割方法，通过优化CRF/Potts损失，显著提升了基于涂鸦标签的训练效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法使用硬伪标签无法表示类别不确定性或错误，因此提出软自标记以改进网络训练。

Method: 提出了一种原则性的辅助损失，系统评估了标准和新CRF松弛方法，并提出通用的连续子问题求解器。

Result: 软自标记方法显著优于复杂的专用WSSS系统，甚至优于全像素级监督。

Conclusion: 软自标记方法在弱监督分割中表现出色，其通用性适用于其他弱监督问题。

Abstract: We consider weakly supervised segmentation where only a fraction of pixels
have ground truth labels (scribbles) and focus on a self-labeling approach
optimizing relaxations of the standard unsupervised CRF/Potts loss on unlabeled
pixels. While WSSS methods can directly optimize such losses via gradient
descent, prior work suggests that higher-order optimization can improve network
training by introducing hidden pseudo-labels and powerful CRF sub-problem
solvers, e.g. graph cut. However, previously used hard pseudo-labels can not
represent class uncertainty or errors, which motivates soft self-labeling. We
derive a principled auxiliary loss and systematically evaluate standard and new
CRF relaxations (convex and non-convex), neighborhood systems, and terms
connecting network predictions with soft pseudo-labels. We also propose a
general continuous sub-problem solver. Using only standard architectures, soft
self-labeling consistently improves scribble-based training and outperforms
significantly more complex specialized WSSS systems. It can outperform full
pixel-precise supervision. Our general ideas apply to other weakly-supervised
problems/systems.

Result: 发现存在最佳剪枝点，稀疏模型在可解释性、泛化能力和人类对齐方面表现更好，但效果因网络架构和规模而异。

Conclusion: 剪枝对视觉表示的影响复杂，需进一步研究其适用场景和方式。

Abstract: Pruning is widely used to reduce the complexity of deep learning models, but
its effects on interpretability and representation learning remain poorly
understood. This paper investigates how pruning influences vision models across
three key dimensions: (i) interpretability, (ii) unsupervised object discovery,
and (iii) alignment with human perception. We first analyze different vision
network architectures to examine how varying sparsity levels affect feature
attribution interpretability methods. Additionally, we explore whether pruning
promotes more succinct and structured representations, potentially improving
unsupervised object discovery by discarding redundant information while
preserving essential features. Finally, we assess whether pruning enhances the
alignment between model representations and human perception, investigating
whether sparser models focus on more discriminative features similarly to
humans. Our findings also reveal the presence of sweet spots, where sparse
models exhibit higher interpretability, downstream generalization and human
alignment. However, these spots highly depend on the network architectures and
their size in terms of trainable parameters. Our results suggest a complex
interplay between these three dimensions, highlighting the importance of
investigating when and how pruning benefits vision representations.

Motivation: 现有方法将人和物体运动独立处理，导致物理上不合理和因果不一致的行为，需要更精确的交互动态建模。

Result: 实验表明，该方法提升了交互生成质量，并提供了可行的交互质量评估指标。

Conclusion: HOI-Dyn通过动态建模和损失优化，显著改善了3D人-物交互的生成效果。

Abstract: Generating realistic 3D human-object interactions (HOIs) remains a
challenging task due to the difficulty of modeling detailed interaction
dynamics. Existing methods treat human and object motions independently,
resulting in physically implausible and causally inconsistent behaviors. In
this work, we present HOI-Dyn, a novel framework that formulates HOI generation
as a driver-responder system, where human actions drive object responses. At
the core of our method is a lightweight transformer-based interaction dynamics
model that explicitly predicts how objects should react to human motion. To
further enforce consistency, we introduce a residual-based dynamics loss that
mitigates the impact of dynamics prediction errors and prevents misleading
optimization signals. The dynamics model is used only during training,
preserving inference efficiency. Through extensive qualitative and quantitative
experiments, we demonstrate that our approach not only enhances the quality of
HOI generation but also establishes a feasible metric for evaluating the
quality of generated interactions.

TL;DR: DeRIS框架通过将Referring Image Segmentation（RIS）分解为感知和认知两个模块，揭示了当前RIS性能的主要瓶颈在于多模态认知能力不足，并提出Loopback Synergy机制和简单数据增强方法提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RIS研究多关注视觉-语言交互和细粒度定位，但对框架中根本瓶颈的系统性分析不足。

Method: DeRIS将RIS分解为感知和认知模块，提出Loopback Synergy机制增强模块协同，并引入非参照样本转换数据增强。

Result: DeRIS在非参照和多参照场景中均表现出色，无需专门架构修改，提升了通用性。

Conclusion: DeRIS通过系统性分析和模块化设计，有效解决了RIS中的认知瓶颈，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Referring Image Segmentation (RIS) is a challenging task that aims to segment
objects in an image based on natural language expressions. While prior studies
have predominantly concentrated on improving vision-language interactions and
achieving fine-grained localization, a systematic analysis of the fundamental
bottlenecks in existing RIS frameworks remains underexplored. To bridge this
gap, we propose DeRIS, a novel framework that decomposes RIS into two key
components: perception and cognition. This modular decomposition facilitates a
systematic analysis of the primary bottlenecks impeding RIS performance. Our
findings reveal that the predominant limitation lies not in perceptual
deficiencies, but in the insufficient multi-modal cognitive capacity of current
models. To mitigate this, we propose a Loopback Synergy mechanism, which
enhances the synergy between the perception and cognition modules, thereby
enabling precise segmentation while simultaneously improving robust image-text
comprehension. Additionally, we analyze and introduce a simple non-referent
sample conversion data augmentation to address the long-tail distribution issue
related to target existence judgement in general scenarios. Notably, DeRIS
demonstrates inherent adaptability to both non- and multi-referents scenarios
without requiring specialized architectural modifications, enhancing its
general applicability. The codes and models are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于MAE预训练的ViT模型，用于3D医学图像分割，特别是在颅内动脉钙化（IAC）的自动量化中表现出色，超越了传统监督学习方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D ViTs在医学图像分割中潜力巨大，但应用较少。IAC作为神经血管疾病的生物标志物，其自动量化可支持大规模风险评估。

Method: 通过MAE框架进行自监督预训练ViT，并在IST-3临床试验数据上微调，用于IAC分割。

Result: 自监督ViT在Dice分数上超越nnU-Net基线3.2分，对小patch和插值上采样表现更优，且对高切片厚度更具鲁棒性，临床风险分类提升46%。

Conclusion: MAE预训练的ViT在IAC分割中表现出色，为医学图像分析提供了高效且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have gained significant popularity in the natural
image domain but have been less successful in 3D medical image segmentation.
Nevertheless, 3D ViTs are particularly interesting for large medical imaging
volumes due to their efficient self-supervised training within the masked
autoencoder (MAE) framework, which enables the use of imaging data without the
need for expensive manual annotations. intracranial arterial calcification
(IAC) is an imaging biomarker visible on routinely acquired CT scans linked to
neurovascular diseases such as stroke and dementia, and automated IAC
quantification could enable their large-scale risk assessment. We pre-train
ViTs with MAE and fine-tune them for IAC segmentation for the first time. To
develop our models, we use highly heterogeneous data from a large clinical
trial, the third International Stroke Trial (IST-3). We evaluate key aspects of
MAE pre-trained ViTs in IAC segmentation, and analyse the clinical
implications. We show: 1) our calibrated self-supervised ViT beats a strong
supervised nnU-Net baseline by 3.2 Dice points, 2) low patch sizes are crucial
for ViTs for IAC segmentation and interpolation upsampling with regular
convolutions is preferable to transposed convolutions for ViT-based models, and
3) our ViTs increase robustness to higher slice thicknesses and improve risk
group classification in a clinical scenario by 46%. Our code is available
online.

TL;DR: 论文提出两种自监督多模态预训练技术和混合模型架构，用于从SAR图像中提取冰川崩解前沿位置，显著提升了精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 冰川冰量损失加剧，需准确监测崩解前沿以理解崩解过程，但现有基于ImageNet预训练的模型因领域差异表现不佳。

Method: 提出自监督多模态预训练技术（利用新数据集SSL4SAR）和混合模型架构（Swin Transformer编码器+残差CNN解码器）。

Result: 在CaFFe基准数据集上，平均距离误差为293米，优于之前最佳模型67米；集成模型误差降至75米，接近人类水平（38米）。

Conclusion: 新技术和架构显著提升了冰川崩解前沿监测的精度，为季节性变化提供了更精确的工具。

Abstract: Glaciers are losing ice mass at unprecedented rates, increasing the need for
accurate, year-round monitoring to understand frontal ablation, particularly
the factors driving the calving process. Deep learning models can extract
calving front positions from Synthetic Aperture Radar imagery to track seasonal
ice losses at the calving fronts of marine- and lake-terminating glaciers. The
current state-of-the-art model relies on ImageNet-pretrained weights. However,
they are suboptimal due to the domain shift between the natural images in
ImageNet and the specialized characteristics of remote sensing imagery, in
particular for Synthetic Aperture Radar imagery. To address this challenge, we
propose two novel self-supervised multimodal pretraining techniques that
leverage SSL4SAR, a new unlabeled dataset comprising 9,563 Sentinel-1 and 14
Sentinel-2 images of Arctic glaciers, with one optical image per glacier in the
dataset. Additionally, we introduce a novel hybrid model architecture that
combines a Swin Transformer encoder with a residual Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN) decoder. When pretrained on SSL4SAR, this model achieves a mean
distance error of 293 m on the "CAlving Fronts and where to Find thEm" (CaFFe)
benchmark dataset, outperforming the prior best model by 67 m. Evaluating an
ensemble of the proposed model on a multi-annotator study of the benchmark
dataset reveals a mean distance error of 75 m, approaching the human
performance of 38 m. This advancement enables precise monitoring of seasonal
changes in glacier calving fronts.

TL;DR: 论文提出DisCon框架，通过将离散标记作为条件信号而非生成目标，解决了连续标记建模的优化挑战和量化信息损失问题，显著提升了图像生成质量。


<details>

Motivation: 现有基于自回归的视觉生成模型因量化过程导致信息损失，而连续标记建模又面临密度估计困难和分布外生成风险。

Method: 提出DisCon框架，将离散标记作为条件信号，建模连续表示的条件概率。

Result: 在ImageNet 256×256生成任务上，DisCon的gFID得分达到1.38，优于现有自回归方法。

Conclusion: DisCon通过结合离散和连续表示的优势，有效提升了图像生成质量，为视觉生成提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have spurred interests in
encoding images as discrete tokens and leveraging autoregressive (AR)
frameworks for visual generation. However, the quantization process in AR-based
visual generation models inherently introduces information loss that degrades
image fidelity. To mitigate this limitation, recent studies have explored to
autoregressively predict continuous tokens. Unlike discrete tokens that reside
in a structured and bounded space, continuous representations exist in an
unbounded, high-dimensional space, making density estimation more challenging
and increasing the risk of generating out-of-distribution artifacts. Based on
the above findings, this work introduces DisCon (Discrete-Conditioned
Continuous Autoregressive Model), a novel framework that reinterprets discrete
tokens as conditional signals rather than generation targets. By modeling the
conditional probability of continuous representations conditioned on discrete
tokens, DisCon circumvents the optimization challenges of continuous token
modeling while avoiding the information loss caused by quantization. DisCon
achieves a gFID score of 1.38 on ImageNet 256$\times$256 generation,
outperforming state-of-the-art autoregressive approaches by a clear margin.

TL;DR: Vision transformers (ViTs) 在医学影像任务中表现出色，但其表示缺乏语义意义且易受微小变化影响，导致分类结果不可靠。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索 ViTs 在医学影像任务中的表示是否具有语义意义及其对微小变化的脆弱性。

Method: 使用基于投影梯度的算法分析 ViTs 的表示。

Result: ViTs 的表示缺乏语义意义，微小变化可导致分类准确率下降超过 60%。

Conclusion: ViTs 在安全关键系统中部署存在根本性挑战，需进一步研究解决其表示问题。

Abstract: Vision transformers (ViTs) have rapidly gained prominence in medical imaging
tasks such as disease classification, segmentation, and detection due to their
superior accuracy compared to conventional deep learning models. However, due
to their size and complex interactions via the self-attention mechanism, they
are not well understood. In particular, it is unclear whether the
representations produced by such models are semantically meaningful. In this
paper, using a projected gradient-based algorithm, we show that their
representations are not semantically meaningful and they are inherently
vulnerable to small changes. Images with imperceptible differences can have
very different representations; on the other hand, images that should belong to
different semantic classes can have nearly identical representations. Such
vulnerability can lead to unreliable classification results; for example,
unnoticeable changes cause the classification accuracy to be reduced by over
60\%. %. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to systematically
demonstrate this fundamental lack of semantic meaningfulness in ViT
representations for medical image classification, revealing a critical
challenge for their deployment in safety-critical systems.

Motivation: 对抗样本的可迁移性对深度神经网络构成重大安全威胁，现有方法通常仅关注单尺度图像，限制了攻击效果。

Method: 采用高斯滤波和三种下采样方法构建多尺度样本，计算各尺度损失函数的梯度并取平均值以确定对抗扰动。

Result: 实验表明，SGP显著提升了攻击成功率，平均攻击成功率提高了2.3%至32.6%。

Conclusion: SGP是一种可扩展性强的方法，易于与现有攻击技术结合，有效提升对抗样本的可迁移性。

Abstract: The transferability of adversarial examples poses a significant security
challenge for deep neural networks, which can be attacked without knowing
anything about them. In this paper, we propose a new Segmented Gaussian Pyramid
(SGP) attack method to enhance the transferability, particularly against
defense models. Unlike existing methods that generally focus on single-scale
images, our approach employs Gaussian filtering and three types of downsampling
to construct a series of multi-scale examples. Then, the gradients of the loss
function with respect to each scale are computed, and their average is used to
determine the adversarial perturbations. The proposed SGP can be considered an
input transformation with high extensibility that is easily integrated into
most existing adversarial attacks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that in
contrast to the state-of-the-art methods, SGP significantly enhances attack
success rates against black-box defense models, with average attack success
rates increasing by 2.3% to 32.6%, based only on transferability.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在多主体个性化生成中存在复杂调整或联合优化的问题，FreeLoRA旨在简化这一过程。

Result: 实验表明FreeLoRA在主体保真度和提示一致性上表现优异。

Conclusion: FreeLoRA为多主体个性化生成提供了一种简单且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Subject-driven image generation plays a crucial role in applications such as
virtual try-on and poster design. Existing approaches typically fine-tune
pretrained generative models or apply LoRA-based adaptations for individual
subjects. However, these methods struggle with multi-subject personalization,
as combining independently adapted modules often requires complex re-tuning or
joint optimization. We present FreeLoRA, a simple and generalizable framework
that enables training-free fusion of subject-specific LoRA modules for
multi-subject personalization. Each LoRA module is adapted on a few images of a
specific subject using a Full Token Tuning strategy, where it is applied across
all tokens in the prompt to encourage weakly supervised token-content
alignment. At inference, we adopt Subject-Aware Inference, activating each
module only on its corresponding subject tokens. This enables training-free
fusion of multiple personalized subjects within a single image, while
mitigating overfitting and mutual interference between subjects. Extensive
experiments show that FreeLoRA achieves strong performance in both subject
fidelity and prompt consistency.

Conclusion: HCNQA通过分层监督优化推理路径，显著提升了3D VQA任务的性能。

Abstract: 3D Visual Question-Answering (3D VQA) is pivotal for models to perceive the
physical world and perform spatial reasoning. Answer-centric supervision is a
commonly used training method for 3D VQA models. Many models that utilize this
strategy have achieved promising results in 3D VQA tasks. However, the
answer-centric approach only supervises the final output of models and allows
models to develop reasoning pathways freely. The absence of supervision on the
reasoning pathway enables the potential for developing superficial shortcuts
through common patterns in question-answer pairs. Moreover, although
slow-thinking methods advance large language models, they suffer from
underthinking. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{HCNQA}, a 3D VQA
model leveraging a hierarchical concentration narrowing supervision method. By
mimicking the human process of gradually focusing from a broad area to specific
objects while searching for answers, our method guides the model to perform
three phases of concentration narrowing through hierarchical supervision. By
supervising key checkpoints on a general reasoning pathway, our method can
ensure the development of a rational and effective reasoning pathway. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate that our method can effectively ensure that
the model develops a rational reasoning pathway and performs better. The code
is available at https://github.com/JianuoZhu/HCNQA.

Conclusion: AMD框架有效提升了自动驾驶中对复杂和罕见轨迹的预测能力，为长尾数据分布问题提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurately predicting the future trajectories of traffic agents is essential
in autonomous driving. However, due to the inherent imbalance in trajectory
distributions, tail data in natural datasets often represents more complex and
hazardous scenarios. Existing studies typically rely solely on a base model's
prediction error, without considering the diversity and uncertainty of
long-tail trajectory patterns. We propose an adaptive momentum and decoupled
contrastive learning framework (AMD), which integrates unsupervised and
supervised contrastive learning strategies. By leveraging an improved momentum
contrast learning (MoCo-DT) and decoupled contrastive learning (DCL) module,
our framework enhances the model's ability to recognize rare and complex
trajectories. Additionally, we design four types of trajectory random
augmentation methods and introduce an online iterative clustering strategy,
allowing the model to dynamically update pseudo-labels and better adapt to the
distributional shifts in long-tail data. We propose three different criteria to
define long-tail trajectories and conduct extensive comparative experiments on
the nuScenes and ETH$/$UCY datasets. The results show that AMD not only
achieves optimal performance in long-tail trajectory prediction but also
demonstrates outstanding overall prediction accuracy.

Conclusion: 多视角光谱滤镜结合普通硬件可实现更准确、实用的超光谱成像解决方案。

Abstract: Hyperspectral reconstruction (HSR) from RGB images is a fundamentally
ill-posed problem due to severe spectral information loss. Existing approaches
typically rely on a single RGB image, limiting reconstruction accuracy. In this
work, we propose a novel multi-image-to-hyperspectral reconstruction (MI-HSR)
framework that leverages a triple-camera smartphone system, where two lenses
are equipped with carefully selected spectral filters. Our configuration,
grounded in theoretical and empirical analysis, enables richer and more diverse
spectral observations than conventional single-camera setups. To support this
new paradigm, we introduce Doomer, the first dataset for MI-HSR, comprising
aligned images from three smartphone cameras and a hyperspectral reference
camera across diverse scenes. We show that the proposed HSR model achieves
consistent improvements over existing methods on the newly proposed benchmark.
In a nutshell, our setup allows 30% towards more accurately estimated spectra
compared to an ordinary RGB camera. Our findings suggest that multi-view
spectral filtering with commodity hardware can unlock more accurate and
practical hyperspectral imaging solutions.

to high computation and memory demands. To address these challenges and
facilitate real-time IE on mobile, we introduce an extremely lightweight
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) framework with around 4K parameters. Our
approach integrates reparameterization with an Incremental Weight Optimization
strategy to ensure efficiency. Additionally, we enhance performance with a
Feature Self-Transform module and a Hierarchical Dual-Path Attention mechanism,
optimized with a Local Variance-Weighted loss. With this efficient framework,
we are the first to achieve real-time IE inference at up to 1,100 frames per
second (FPS) while delivering competitive image quality, achieving the best
trade-off between speed and performance across multiple IE tasks. The code will
be available at https://github.com/AVC2-UESTC/MobileIE.git.

TL;DR: 提出动态时间槽变换器（DTST）模块，用于解决手术视频中对象中心表示学习的挑战，并在多个手术数据库中实现最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决手术视频中异构场景难以解析为有意义槽的问题，现有方法在图像上表现良好但在手术视频中性能较低。

Method: 提出动态时间槽变换器（DTST）模块，结合时间推理和预测未来槽初始化。

Result: 在多个手术数据库中实现最先进性能。

Conclusion: 无监督对象中心方法可应用于真实世界数据，成为医疗应用中的常见工具。

Abstract: Object-centric slot attention is an emerging paradigm for unsupervised
learning of structured, interpretable object-centric representations (slots).
This enables effective reasoning about objects and events at a low
computational cost and is thus applicable to critical healthcare applications,
such as real-time interpretation of surgical video. The heterogeneous scenes in
real-world applications like surgery are, however, difficult to parse into a
meaningful set of slots. Current approaches with an adaptive slot count perform
well on images, but their performance on surgical videos is low. To address
this challenge, we propose a dynamic temporal slot transformer (DTST) module
that is trained both for temporal reasoning and for predicting the optimal
future slot initialization. The model achieves state-of-the-art performance on
multiple surgical databases, demonstrating that unsupervised object-centric
methods can be applied to real-world data and become part of the common arsenal
in healthcare applications.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新型的自增强原型进化与双知识合作框架（SPRED），用于解决半监督终身行人重识别（Semi-LReID）问题，显著提升了未标记数据的利用效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景中标注资源有限，现有终身行人重识别方法在未标记数据利用时性能下降严重，亟需解决半监督终身行人重识别问题。

Method: 引入可学习的身份原型动态捕捉身份分布并生成高质量伪标签，通过双知识合作方案整合当前模型和历史模型的优势，净化噪声伪标签。

Result: 在Semi-LReID基准测试中，SPRED达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: SPRED通过自增强循环设计，有效提升了未标记数据的利用效率和长期学习性能。

Abstract: Current lifelong person re-identification (LReID) methods predominantly rely
on fully labeled data streams. However, in real-world scenarios where
annotation resources are limited, a vast amount of unlabeled data coexists with
scarce labeled samples, leading to the Semi-Supervised LReID (Semi-LReID)
problem where LReID methods suffer severe performance degradation. Existing
LReID methods, even when combined with semi-supervised strategies, suffer from
limited long-term adaptation performance due to struggling with the noisy
knowledge occurring during unlabeled data utilization. In this paper, we
pioneer the investigation of Semi-LReID, introducing a novel Self-Reinforcing
Prototype Evolution with Dual-Knowledge Cooperation framework (SPRED). Our key
innovation lies in establishing a self-reinforcing cycle between dynamic
prototype-guided pseudo-label generation and new-old knowledge collaborative
purification to enhance the utilization of unlabeled data. Specifically,
learnable identity prototypes are introduced to dynamically capture the
identity distributions and generate high-quality pseudo-labels. Then, the
dual-knowledge cooperation scheme integrates current model specialization and
historical model generalization, refining noisy pseudo-labels. Through this
cyclic design, reliable pseudo-labels are progressively mined to improve
current-stage learning and ensure positive knowledge propagation over long-term
learning. Experiments on the established Semi-LReID benchmarks show that our
SPRED achieves state-of-the-art performance. Our source code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以处理需要深度推理的复杂隐式假设性指令，且缺乏支持此类推理的训练和评估数据集。

Method: 提出Reason50K数据集和ReasonBrain框架，结合多模态大语言模型和细粒度推理线索提取模块（FRCE），并引入跨模态增强器（CME）减少语义损失。

Result: ReasonBrain在推理场景中表现优于现有基线，并在传统指令编辑任务中展示强零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: Reason50K和ReasonBrain为复杂假设性指令的图像编辑提供了有效解决方案，并具备广泛适用性。

Abstract: Instruction-based image editing (IIE) has advanced rapidly with the success
of diffusion models. However, existing efforts primarily focus on simple and
explicit instructions to execute editing operations such as adding, deleting,
moving, or swapping objects. They struggle to handle more complex implicit
hypothetical instructions that require deeper reasoning to infer plausible
visual changes and user intent. Additionally, current datasets provide limited
support for training and evaluating reasoning-aware editing capabilities.
Architecturally, these methods also lack mechanisms for fine-grained detail
extraction that support such reasoning. To address these limitations, we
propose Reason50K, a large-scale dataset specifically curated for training and
evaluating hypothetical instruction reasoning image editing, along with
ReasonBrain, a novel framework designed to reason over and execute implicit
hypothetical instructions across diverse scenarios. Reason50K includes over 50K
samples spanning four key reasoning scenarios: Physical, Temporal, Causal, and
Story reasoning. ReasonBrain leverages Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)
for editing guidance generation and a diffusion model for image synthesis,
incorporating a Fine-grained Reasoning Cue Extraction (FRCE) module to capture
detailed visual and textual semantics essential for supporting instruction
reasoning. To mitigate the semantic loss, we further introduce a Cross-Modal
Enhancer (CME) that enables rich interactions between the fine-grained cues and
MLLM-derived features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ReasonBrain
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on reasoning scenarios
while exhibiting strong zero-shot generalization to conventional IIE tasks. Our
dataset and code will be released publicly.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床实施DIR需要基于体素的空间精度指标，但胃肠道器官的高移动性使得手动标记具有挑战性。

Method: 通过半自动化管道，从静态3D患者扫描生成21个运动阶段的4D序列，模拟GI运动，并使用六种DIR方法进行评估。

Result: 生成的DT模拟了真实的GI运动，运动幅度与真实患者数据相似，并提供了详细的DIR性能指标和剂量映射验证。

Conclusion: 该管道能够严格测试DIR工具在动态复杂解剖区域的性能，实现空间和剂量精度的详细评估。

Abstract: Objective: Clinical implementation of deformable image registration (DIR)
requires voxel-based spatial accuracy metrics such as manually identified
landmarks, which are challenging to implement for highly mobile
gastrointestinal (GI) organs. To address this, patient-specific digital twins
(DT) modeling temporally varying motion were created to assess the accuracy of
DIR methods. Approach: 21 motion phases simulating digestive GI motion as 4D
sequences were generated from static 3D patient scans using published
analytical GI motion models through a semi-automated pipeline. Eleven datasets,
including six T2w FSE MRI (T2w MRI), two T1w 4D golden-angle stack-of-stars,
and three contrast-enhanced CT scans. The motion amplitudes of the DTs were
assessed against real patient stomach motion amplitudes extracted from
independent 4D MRI datasets. The generated DTs were then used to assess six
different DIR methods using target registration error, Dice similarity
coefficient, and the 95th percentile Hausdorff distance using summary metrics
and voxel-level granular visualizations. Finally, for a subset of T2w MRI scans
from patients treated with MR-guided radiation therapy, dose distributions were
warped and accumulated to assess dose warping errors, including evaluations of
DIR performance in both low- and high-dose regions for patient-specific error
estimation. Main results: Our proposed pipeline synthesized DTs modeling
realistic GI motion, achieving mean and maximum motion amplitudes and a mean
log Jacobian determinant within 0.8 mm and 0.01, respectively, similar to
published real-patient gastric motion data. It also enables the extraction of
detailed quantitative DIR performance metrics and rigorous validation of dose
mapping accuracy. Significance: The pipeline enables rigorously testing DIR
tools for dynamic, anatomically complex regions enabling granular spatial and
dosimetric accuracies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 果园生长期树冠密集遮挡树干和分支，限制了机器视觉系统的能力，而休眠期树冠开放可见。通过融合多季节数据，解决遮挡问题。

Method: 使用YOLOv9-Seg进行实例分割，Kinect Fusion进行3D重建，Fast GICP进行模型对齐，整合休眠期和生长期的RGB-D数据。

Result: YOLOv9-Seg的MSE为0.0047，分割mAP@50达0.78；Kinect Fusion的RMSE为5.23 mm（树干直径）、4.50 mm（分支直径）、13.72 mm（分支间距）；Fast GICP的最小适应分数为0.00197。

Conclusion: 多季节融合框架显著提升了机器人系统对树冠结构的建模能力，支持精准修剪和果园自动化操作。

Abstract: In orchard automation, dense foliage during the canopy season severely
occludes tree structures, minimizing visibility to various canopy parts such as
trunks and branches, which limits the ability of a machine vision system.
However, canopy structure is more open and visible during the dormant season
when trees are defoliated. In this work, we present an information fusion
framework that integrates multi-seasonal structural data to support robotic and
automated crop load management during the entire growing season. The framework
combines high-resolution RGB-D imagery from both dormant and canopy periods
using YOLOv9-Seg for instance segmentation, Kinect Fusion for 3D
reconstruction, and Fast Generalized Iterative Closest Point (Fast GICP) for
model alignment. Segmentation outputs from YOLOv9-Seg were used to extract
depth-informed masks, which enabled accurate 3D point cloud reconstruction via
Kinect Fusion; these reconstructed models from each season were subsequently
aligned using Fast GICP to achieve spatially coherent multi-season fusion. The
YOLOv9-Seg model, trained on manually annotated images, achieved a mean squared
error (MSE) of 0.0047 and segmentation mAP@50 scores up to 0.78 for trunks in
dormant season dataset. Kinect Fusion enabled accurate reconstruction of tree
geometry, validated with field measurements resulting in root mean square
errors (RMSE) of 5.23 mm for trunk diameter, 4.50 mm for branch diameter, and
13.72 mm for branch spacing. Fast GICP achieved precise cross-seasonal
registration with a minimum fitness score of 0.00197, allowing integrated,
comprehensive tree structure modeling despite heavy occlusions during the
growing season. This fused structural representation enables robotic systems to
access otherwise obscured architectural information, improving the precision of
pruning, thinning, and other automated orchard operations.

TL;DR: IC-Custom是一个统一的图像定制框架，通过上下文学习整合位置感知和无位置定制，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前图像定制方法缺乏通用框架，限制了多样化应用。

Method: 提出IC-Custom框架，利用多模态注意力机制和任务导向的注册令牌，结合高质量数据集。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异，人类偏好提升73%，仅训练0.4%参数。

Conclusion: IC-Custom为工业应用提供了高效、通用的图像定制解决方案。

Abstract: Image customization, a crucial technique for industrial media production,
aims to generate content that is consistent with reference images. However,
current approaches conventionally separate image customization into
position-aware and position-free customization paradigms and lack a universal
framework for diverse customization, limiting their applications across various
scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we propose IC-Custom, a unified
framework that seamlessly integrates position-aware and position-free image
customization through in-context learning. IC-Custom concatenates reference
images with target images to a polyptych, leveraging DiT's multi-modal
attention mechanism for fine-grained token-level interactions. We introduce the
In-context Multi-Modal Attention (ICMA) mechanism with learnable task-oriented
register tokens and boundary-aware positional embeddings to enable the model to
correctly handle different task types and distinguish various inputs in
polyptych configurations. To bridge the data gap, we carefully curated a
high-quality dataset of 12k identity-consistent samples with 8k from real-world
sources and 4k from high-quality synthetic data, avoiding the overly glossy and
over-saturated synthetic appearance. IC-Custom supports various industrial
applications, including try-on, accessory placement, furniture arrangement, and
creative IP customization. Extensive evaluations on our proposed ProductBench
and the publicly available DreamBench demonstrate that IC-Custom significantly
outperforms community workflows, closed-source models, and state-of-the-art
open-source approaches. IC-Custom achieves approximately 73% higher human
preference across identity consistency, harmonicity, and text alignment
metrics, while training only 0.4% of the original model parameters. Project

Method: 提出evMLP模型，利用事件驱动机制选择性更新图像或特征图中的变化区域（事件）。

Result: 在ImageNet分类任务中表现优异，视频数据集上显著降低计算成本，同时保持输出一致性。

Conclusion: evMLP通过事件驱动机制有效减少冗余计算，为视觉模型架构提供了新思路。

Abstract: Deep neural networks have achieved remarkable results in computer vision
tasks. In the early days, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) were the
mainstream architecture. In recent years, Vision Transformers (ViTs) have
become increasingly popular. In addition, exploring applications of multi-layer
perceptrons (MLPs) has provided new perspectives for research into vision model
architectures. In this paper, we present evMLP accompanied by a simple
event-driven local update mechanism. The proposed evMLP can independently
process patches on images or feature maps via MLPs. We define changes between
consecutive frames as "events". Under the event-driven local update mechanism,
evMLP selectively processes patches where events occur. For sequential image
data (e.g., video processing), this approach improves computational performance
by avoiding redundant computations. Through ImageNet image classification
experiments, evMLP attains accuracy competitive with state-of-the-art models.
More significantly, experimental results on multiple video datasets demonstrate
that evMLP reduces computational cost via its event-driven local update
mechanism while maintaining output consistency with its non-event-driven
baseline. The code and trained models are available at

Abstract: Text-to-video (T2V) generation has recently attracted considerable attention,
resulting in the development of numerous high-quality datasets that have
propelled progress in this area. However, existing public datasets are
primarily composed of isolated text-video (T-V) pairs and thus fail to support
the modeling of coherent multi-clip video sequences. To address this
limitation, we introduce CI-VID, a dataset that moves beyond isolated
text-to-video (T2V) generation toward text-and-video-to-video (TV2V)
generation, enabling models to produce coherent, multi-scene video sequences.
CI-VID contains over 340,000 samples, each featuring a coherent sequence of
video clips with text captions that capture both the individual content of each
clip and the transitions between them, enabling visually and textually grounded
generation. To further validate the effectiveness of CI-VID, we design a
comprehensive, multi-dimensional benchmark incorporating human evaluation,
VLM-based assessment, and similarity-based metrics. Experimental results
demonstrate that models trained on CI-VID exhibit significant improvements in
both accuracy and content consistency when generating video sequences. This
facilitates the creation of story-driven content with smooth visual transitions
and strong temporal coherence, underscoring the quality and practical utility
of the CI-VID dataset We release the CI-VID dataset and the accompanying code

Conclusion: LongAnimation通过动态全局-局部范式解决了长动画上色的颜色一致性问题，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Animation colorization is a crucial part of real animation industry
production. Long animation colorization has high labor costs. Therefore,
automated long animation colorization based on the video generation model has
significant research value. Existing studies are limited to short-term
colorization. These studies adopt a local paradigm, fusing overlapping features
to achieve smooth transitions between local segments. However, the local
paradigm neglects global information, failing to maintain long-term color
consistency. In this study, we argue that ideal long-term color consistency can
be achieved through a dynamic global-local paradigm, i.e., dynamically
extracting global color-consistent features relevant to the current generation.
Specifically, we propose LongAnimation, a novel framework, which mainly
includes a SketchDiT, a Dynamic Global-Local Memory (DGLM), and a Color
Consistency Reward. The SketchDiT captures hybrid reference features to support
the DGLM module. The DGLM module employs a long video understanding model to
dynamically compress global historical features and adaptively fuse them with
the current generation features. To refine the color consistency, we introduce
a Color Consistency Reward. During inference, we propose a color consistency
fusion to smooth the video segment transition. Extensive experiments on both
short-term (14 frames) and long-term (average 500 frames) animations show the
effectiveness of LongAnimation in maintaining short-term and long-term color
consistency for open-domain animation colorization task. The code can be found

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate remarkable
capabilities on static images, they often fall short in comprehending dynamic,
information-dense short-form videos, a dominant medium in today's digital
landscape. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{Kwai Keye-VL}, an
8-billion-parameter multimodal foundation model engineered for leading-edge
performance in short-video understanding while maintaining robust
general-purpose vision-language abilities. The development of Keye-VL rests on
two core pillars: a massive, high-quality dataset exceeding 600 billion tokens
with a strong emphasis on video, and an innovative training recipe. This recipe
features a four-stage pre-training process for solid vision-language alignment,
followed by a meticulous two-phase post-training process. The first
post-training stage enhances foundational capabilities like instruction
following, while the second phase focuses on stimulating advanced reasoning. In
this second phase, a key innovation is our five-mode ``cold-start'' data
mixture, which includes ``thinking'', ``non-thinking'', ``auto-think'', ``think
with image'', and high-quality video data. This mixture teaches the model to
decide when and how to reason. Subsequent reinforcement learning (RL) and
alignment steps further enhance these reasoning capabilities and correct
abnormal model behaviors, such as repetitive outputs. To validate our approach,
we conduct extensive evaluations, showing that Keye-VL achieves
state-of-the-art results on public video benchmarks and remains highly
competitive on general image-based tasks (Figure 1). Furthermore, we develop
and release the \textbf{KC-MMBench}, a new benchmark tailored for real-world
short-video scenarios, where Keye-VL shows a significant advantage.

Conclusion: FreeMorph通过创新设计解决了无需调优方法的挑战，实现了高效高质量的图像变形。

Abstract: We present FreeMorph, the first tuning-free method for image morphing that
accommodates inputs with different semantics or layouts. Unlike existing
methods that rely on finetuning pre-trained diffusion models and are limited by
time constraints and semantic/layout discrepancies, FreeMorph delivers
high-fidelity image morphing without requiring per-instance training. Despite
their efficiency and potential, tuning-free methods face challenges in
maintaining high-quality results due to the non-linear nature of the multi-step
denoising process and biases inherited from the pre-trained diffusion model. In
this paper, we introduce FreeMorph to address these challenges by integrating
two key innovations. 1) We first propose a guidance-aware spherical
interpolation design that incorporates explicit guidance from the input images
by modifying the self-attention modules, thereby addressing identity loss and
ensuring directional transitions throughout the generated sequence. 2) We
further introduce a step-oriented variation trend that blends self-attention
modules derived from each input image to achieve controlled and consistent
transitions that respect both inputs. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate
that FreeMorph outperforms existing methods, being 10x ~ 50x faster and
establishing a new state-of-the-art for image morphing.

Conclusion: 多模态基础模型在视觉任务中表现尚可，但仍有改进空间，尤其是在几何任务和提示敏感性方面。

Abstract: Multimodal foundation models, such as GPT-4o, have recently made remarkable
progress, but it is not clear where exactly these models stand in terms of
understanding vision. In this paper, we benchmark the performance of popular
multimodal foundation models (GPT-4o, o4-mini, Gemini 1.5 Pro and Gemini 2.0
Flash, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Qwen2-VL, Llama 3.2) on standard computer vision
tasks (semantic segmentation, object detection, image classification, depth and
surface normal prediction) using established datasets (e.g., COCO, ImageNet and
its variants, etc).
  The main challenges to performing this are: 1) most models are trained to
output text and cannot natively express versatile domains, such as segments or
3D geometry, and 2) many leading models are proprietary and accessible only at
an API level, i.e., there is no weight access to adapt them. We address these
challenges by translating standard vision tasks into equivalent text-promptable
and API-compatible tasks via prompt chaining to create a standardized
benchmarking framework.
  We observe that 1) the models are not close to the state-of-the-art
specialist models at any task. However, 2) they are respectable generalists;
this is remarkable as they are presumably trained on primarily image-text-based
tasks. 3) They perform semantic tasks notably better than geometric ones. 4)
While the prompt-chaining techniques affect performance, better models exhibit
less sensitivity to prompt variations. 5) GPT-4o performs the best among
non-reasoning models, securing the top position in 4 out of 6 tasks, 6)
reasoning models, e.g. o3, show improvements in geometric tasks, and 7) a
preliminary analysis of models with native image generation, like the latest
GPT-4o, shows they exhibit quirks like hallucinations and spatial
misalignments.

TL;DR: Locality-aware Parallel Decoding (LPD) 通过灵活的并行自回归建模和局部感知生成顺序，显著加速自回归图像生成，减少生成步骤并降低延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自回归图像生成依赖顺序预测，导致高延迟。现有方法尝试并行化但效果有限，需在保持质量的同时实现高效并行化。

Method: 提出两种技术：1) 灵活的并行自回归建模，支持任意生成顺序和并行度；2) 局部感知生成顺序，最小化组内依赖并最大化上下文支持。

Result: 在 ImageNet 类条件生成中，将生成步骤从 256 减少到 20（256×256 分辨率）和 1024 减少到 48（512×512 分辨率），延迟降低至少 3.4 倍。

Conclusion: LPD 在保持生成质量的同时显著提升了并行化效率和生成速度。

Abstract: We present Locality-aware Parallel Decoding (LPD) to accelerate
autoregressive image generation. Traditional autoregressive image generation
relies on next-patch prediction, a memory-bound process that leads to high
latency. Existing works have tried to parallelize next-patch prediction by
shifting to multi-patch prediction to accelerate the process, but only achieved
limited parallelization. To achieve high parallelization while maintaining
generation quality, we introduce two key techniques: (1) Flexible Parallelized
Autoregressive Modeling, a novel architecture that enables arbitrary generation
ordering and degrees of parallelization. It uses learnable position query
tokens to guide generation at target positions while ensuring mutual visibility
among concurrently generated tokens for consistent parallel decoding. (2)
Locality-aware Generation Ordering, a novel schedule that forms groups to
minimize intra-group dependencies and maximize contextual support, enhancing
generation quality. With these designs, we reduce the generation steps from 256
to 20 (256$\times$256 res.) and 1024 to 48 (512$\times$512 res.) without
compromising quality on the ImageNet class-conditional generation, and
achieving at least 3.4$\times$ lower latency than previous parallelized
autoregressive models.

### [89] [Environment-Aware and Human-Cooperative Swing Control for Lower-Limb Prostheses in Diverse Obstacle Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01111)
*Haosen Xing,Haoran Ma,Sijin Zhang,Hartmut Geyer*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出一种新型控制策略，结合环境感知与用户意图，优化下肢假肢在复杂地形中的障碍物导航能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有下肢假肢控制策略缺乏对环境及用户意图的感知，尤其在复杂地形中表现不足。

Method: 通过机载深度摄像头检测障碍物，动态调整摆动轨迹，早期抬高以避开障碍物，后期依赖用户生物力学信号。

Result: 实验显示，在150次跨越和30次踏上障碍物的测试中，成功率达100%。

Conclusion: 该系统有效解决了障碍物导航问题，展示了在复杂地形中的适应性和用户意图响应能力。

Abstract: Current control strategies for powered lower limb prostheses often lack
awareness of the environment and the user's intended interactions with it. This
limitation becomes particularly apparent in complex terrains. Obstacle
negotiation, a critical scenario exemplifying such challenges, requires both
real-time perception of obstacle geometry and responsiveness to user intention
about when and where to step over or onto, to dynamically adjust swing
trajectories. We propose a novel control strategy that fuses environmental
awareness and human cooperativeness: an on-board depth camera detects obstacles
ahead of swing phase, prompting an elevated early-swing trajectory to ensure
clearance, while late-swing control defers to natural biomechanical cues from
the user. This approach enables intuitive stepping strategies without requiring
unnatural movement patterns. Experiments with three non-amputee participants
demonstrated 100 percent success across more than 150 step-overs and 30
step-ons with randomly placed obstacles of varying heights (4-16 cm) and
distances (15-70 cm). By effectively addressing obstacle navigation -- a
gateway challenge for complex terrain mobility -- our system demonstrates
adaptability to both environmental constraints and user intentions, with
promising applications across diverse locomotion scenarios.

TL;DR: VISTA是一种主动探索方法，帮助机器人规划信息丰富的轨迹，以提升与任务相关的3D地图质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器人需要在复杂环境中高效搜索目标物体并构建实时语义3D地图，现有方法在计算速度和重建质量上存在不足。

Method: VISTA采用基于视点的图像选择和语义任务感知，结合几何视图多样性和任务相关性的新型覆盖度量。

Result: 在静态数据集上，VISTA在计算速度和重建质量上优于现有方法；在硬件实验中，成功率显著提升。

Conclusion: VISTA是一种高效、平台无关的解决方案，适用于多种机器人平台。

Abstract: We present VISTA (Viewpoint-based Image selection with Semantic Task
Awareness), an active exploration method for robots to plan informative
trajectories that improve 3D map quality in areas most relevant for task
completion. Given an open-vocabulary search instruction (e.g., "find a
person"), VISTA enables a robot to explore its environment to search for the
object of interest, while simultaneously building a real-time semantic 3D
Gaussian Splatting reconstruction of the scene. The robot navigates its
environment by planning receding-horizon trajectories that prioritize semantic
similarity to the query and exploration of unseen regions of the environment.
To evaluate trajectories, VISTA introduces a novel, efficient
viewpoint-semantic coverage metric that quantifies both the geometric view
diversity and task relevance in the 3D scene. On static datasets, our coverage
metric outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, FisherRF and Bayes' Rays, in
computation speed and reconstruction quality. In quadrotor hardware
experiments, VISTA achieves 6x higher success rates in challenging maps,
compared to baseline methods, while matching baseline performance in less
challenging maps. Lastly, we show that VISTA is platform-agnostic by deploying
it on a quadrotor drone and a Spot quadruped robot. Open-source code will be
released upon acceptance of the paper.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有综述多关注通用音频应用，未充分考虑机器人领域的约束和深度学习的最新进展，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 回顾了经典方法（如TDOA、波束成形等）和现代深度学习方法（如CNN、CRNN、注意力机制），并探讨了数据与训练策略。

Result: 总结了不同机器人类型和应用领域的研究，并指出了当前SSL在环境鲁棒性、多声源处理等方面的挑战。

Conclusion: 提出了未来研究方向，以实现更鲁棒、高效且可解释的深度学习SSL方法。

Abstract: Sound source localization (SSL) adds a spatial dimension to auditory
perception, allowing a system to pinpoint the origin of speech, machinery
noise, warning tones, or other acoustic events, capabilities that facilitate
robot navigation, human-machine dialogue, and condition monitoring. While
existing surveys provide valuable historical context, they typically address
general audio applications and do not fully account for robotic constraints or
the latest advancements in deep learning. This review addresses these gaps by
offering a robotics-focused synthesis, emphasizing recent progress in deep
learning methodologies. We start by reviewing classical methods such as Time
Difference of Arrival (TDOA), beamforming, Steered-Response Power (SRP), and
subspace analysis. Subsequently, we delve into modern machine learning (ML) and
deep learning (DL) approaches, discussing traditional ML and neural networks
(NNs), convolutional neural networks (CNNs), convolutional recurrent neural
networks (CRNNs), and emerging attention-based architectures. The data and
training strategy that are the two cornerstones of DL-based SSL are explored.
Studies are further categorized by robot types and application domains to
facilitate researchers in identifying relevant work for their specific
contexts. Finally, we highlight the current challenges in SSL works in general,
regarding environmental robustness, sound source multiplicity, and specific
implementation constraints in robotics, as well as data and learning strategies
in DL-based SSL. Also, we sketch promising directions to offer an actionable
roadmap toward robust, adaptable, efficient, and explainable DL-based SSL for
next-generation robots.

Motivation: 机器人超声在复杂手术任务中的应用受限，主要由于缺乏针对这些任务的真实仿真环境。

Method: 开发SonoGym平台，结合物理和生成建模方法模拟超声数据，支持并行仿真，并整合深度强化学习和模仿学习算法。

Result: 成功训练出适用于骨科手术的自主策略，同时揭示了当前方法在临床环境中的局限性。

Conclusion: SonoGym有望推动机器人学习在复杂手术应用中的研究。

Abstract: Ultrasound (US) is a widely used medical imaging modality due to its
real-time capabilities, non-invasive nature, and cost-effectiveness. Robotic
ultrasound can further enhance its utility by reducing operator dependence and
improving access to complex anatomical regions. For this, while deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) and imitation learning (IL) have shown potential
for autonomous navigation, their use in complex surgical tasks such as anatomy
reconstruction and surgical guidance remains limited -- largely due to the lack
of realistic and efficient simulation environments tailored to these tasks. We
introduce SonoGym, a scalable simulation platform for complex robotic
ultrasound tasks that enables parallel simulation across tens to hundreds of
environments. Our framework supports realistic and real-time simulation of US
data from CT-derived 3D models of the anatomy through both a physics-based and
a generative modeling approach. Sonogym enables the training of DRL and recent
IL agents (vision transformers and diffusion policies) for relevant tasks in
robotic orthopedic surgery by integrating common robotic platforms and
orthopedic end effectors. We further incorporate submodular DRL -- a recent
method that handles history-dependent rewards -- for anatomy reconstruction and
safe reinforcement learning for surgery. Our results demonstrate successful
policy learning across a range of scenarios, while also highlighting the
limitations of current methods in clinically relevant environments. We believe
our simulation can facilitate research in robot learning approaches for such
challenging robotic surgery applications. Dataset, codes, and videos are
publicly available at https://sonogym.github.io/.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统欧几里得距离不可微，而现有可微距离度量存在不足，需要改进。

Method: 提出了一种新的平滑投影方法，确保距离在物体重叠时消失。

Result: 实验结果表明该方法有效，并通过Python模拟包UAIBot公开可用。

Conclusion: 新方法解决了现有可微距离度量的缺陷，更具实用性和简单性。

Abstract: In many robotics applications, it is necessary to compute not only the
distance between the robot and the environment, but also its derivative - for
example, when using control barrier functions. However, since the traditional
Euclidean distance is not differentiable, there is a need for alternative
distance metrics that possess this property. Recently, a metric with guaranteed
differentiability was proposed [1]. This approach has some important drawbacks,
which we address in this paper. We provide much simpler and practical
expressions for the smooth projection for general convex polytopes.
Additionally, as opposed to [1], we ensure that the distance vanishes as the
objects overlap. We show the efficacy of the approach in experimental results.
Our proposed distance metric is publicly available through the Python-based
simulation package UAIBot.

Motivation: 传统固定尺寸运动基元在复杂场景中效率低，需更高效的方法。

Method: 在SMPL库中实现，利用burs作为自适应运动基元，优化C空间探索。

Result: 在复杂场景（尤其是高自由度机械臂）中表现优于固定基元方法，简单场景性能相当。

Conclusion: burs作为自适应运动基元显著提升规划效率，适用于复杂环境。

Abstract: This work proposes a motion planning algorithm for robotic manipulators that
combines sampling-based and search-based planning methods. The core
contribution of the proposed approach is the usage of burs of free
configuration space (C-space) as adaptive motion primitives within the graph
search algorithm. Due to their feature to adaptively expand in free C-space,
burs enable more efficient exploration of the configuration space compared to
fixed-sized motion primitives, significantly reducing the time to find a valid
path and the number of required expansions. The algorithm is implemented within
the existing SMPL (Search-Based Motion Planning Library) library and evaluated
through a series of different scenarios involving manipulators with varying
number of degrees-of-freedom (DoF) and environment complexity. Results
demonstrate that the bur-based approach outperforms fixed-primitive planning in
complex scenarios, particularly for high DoF manipulators, while achieving
comparable performance in simpler scenarios.

Abstract: As modern computing advances, new interaction paradigms have emerged,
particularly in Augmented Reality (AR), which overlays virtual interfaces onto
physical objects. This evolution poses challenges in machine perception,
especially for tasks like 3D object pose estimation in complex, dynamic
environments. Our project addresses critical issues in human-robot interaction
within mobile AR, focusing on non-intrusive, spatially aware interfaces. We
present URSA, an LLM-driven immersive AR system developed for NASA's 2023-2024
SUITS challenge, targeting future spaceflight needs such as the Artemis
missions. URSA integrates three core technologies: a head-mounted AR device
(e.g., HoloLens) for intuitive visual feedback, voice control powered by large
language models for hands-free interaction, and robot tracking algorithms that
enable accurate 3D localization in dynamic settings. To enhance precision, we
leverage digital twin localization technologies, using datasets like
DTTD-Mobile and specialized hardware such as the ZED2 camera for real-world
tracking under noise and occlusion. Our system enables real-time robot control
and monitoring via an AR interface, even in the absence of ground-truth
sensors--vital for hazardous or remote operations. Key contributions include:
(1) a non-intrusive AR interface with LLM-based voice input; (2) a ZED2-based
dataset tailored for non-rigid robotic bodies; (3) a Local Mission Control
Console (LMCC) for mission visualization; (4) a transformer-based 6DoF pose
estimator (DTTDNet) optimized for depth fusion and real-time tracking; and (5)
end-to-end integration for astronaut mission support. This work advances
digital twin applications in robotics, offering scalable solutions for both
aerospace and industrial domains.

Conclusion: JumpER为极端欠驱动和极端地形下的运动任务提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown great potential in enabling quadruped
robots to perform agile locomotion. However, directly training policies to
simultaneously handle dual extreme challenges, i.e., extreme underactuation and
extreme terrains, as in monopedal hopping tasks, remains highly challenging due
to unstable early-stage interactions and unreliable reward feedback. To address
this, we propose JumpER (jump-start reinforcement learning via self-evolving
priors), an RL training framework that structures policy learning into multiple
stages of increasing complexity. By dynamically generating self-evolving priors
through iterative bootstrapping of previously learned policies, JumpER
progressively refines and enhances guidance, thereby stabilizing exploration
and policy optimization without relying on external expert priors or
handcrafted reward shaping. Specifically, when integrated with a structured
three-stage curriculum that incrementally evolves action modality, observation
space, and task objective, JumpER enables quadruped robots to achieve robust
monopedal hopping on unpredictable terrains for the first time. Remarkably, the
resulting policy effectively handles challenging scenarios that traditional
methods struggle to conquer, including wide gaps up to 60 cm, irregularly
spaced stairs, and stepping stones with distances varying from 15 cm to 35 cm.
JumpER thus provides a principled and scalable approach for addressing
locomotion tasks under the dual challenges of extreme underactuation and
extreme terrains.

Abstract: Designing diverse and safety-critical driving scenarios is essential for
evaluating autonomous driving systems. In this paper, we propose a novel
framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for few-shot code
generation to automatically synthesize driving scenarios within the CARLA
simulator, which has flexibility in scenario scripting, efficient code-based
control of traffic participants, and enforcement of realistic physical
dynamics. Given a few example prompts and code samples, the LLM generates
safety-critical scenario scripts that specify the behavior and placement of
traffic participants, with a particular focus on collision events. To bridge
the gap between simulation and real-world appearance, we integrate a video
generation pipeline using Cosmos-Transfer1 with ControlNet, which converts
rendered scenes into realistic driving videos. Our approach enables
controllable scenario generation and facilitates the creation of rare but
critical edge cases, such as pedestrian crossings under occlusion or sudden
vehicle cut-ins. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our
method in generating a wide range of realistic, diverse, and safety-critical
scenarios, offering a promising tool for simulation-based testing of autonomous
vehicles.

Additionally, our system produces interpretable natural language explanations

Abstract: Accurate motion forecasting is critical for safe and efficient autonomous
driving, enabling vehicles to predict future trajectories and make informed
decisions in complex traffic scenarios. Most of the current designs of motion
prediction models are based on the major representation of lane centerlines,
which limits their capability to capture critical road environments and traffic
rules and constraints. In this work, we propose an enhanced motion forecasting
model informed by multiple vector map elements, including lane boundaries and
road edges, that facilitates a richer and more complete representation of
driving environments. An effective feature fusion strategy is developed to
merge information in different vector map components, where the model learns
holistic information on road structures and their interactions with agents.
Since encoding more information about the road environment increases memory
usage and is computationally expensive, we developed an effective pruning
mechanism that filters the most relevant map connections to the target agent,
ensuring computational efficiency while maintaining essential spatial and
semantic relationships for accurate trajectory prediction. Overcoming the
limitations of lane centerline-based models, our method provides a more
informative and efficient representation of the driving environment and
advances the state of the art for autonomous vehicle motion forecasting. We
verify our approach with extensive experiments on the Argoverse 2 motion
forecasting dataset, where our method maintains competitiveness on AV2 while
achieving improved performance.

Conclusion: TriVLA通过动态感知和统一架构显著提升了机器人控制的泛化能力。

Abstract: Recent advancements in vision-language models (VLMs) for common-sense
reasoning have led to the development of vision-language-action (VLA) models,
enabling robots to perform generalized manipulation. Although existing
autoregressive VLA methods design a specific architecture like dual-system to
leverage large-scale pretrained knowledge, they tend to capture static
information, often neglecting the dynamic aspects vital for embodied tasks. To
this end, we propose TriVLA, a unified Vision-Language-Action model with a
triple-system architecture for general robot control. The vision-language
module (System 2) interprets the environment through vision and language
instructions. The dynamics perception module (System 3) inherently produces
visual representations that encompass both current static information and
predicted future dynamics, thereby providing valuable guidance for policy
learning. TriVLA utilizes pre-trained VLM model and fine-tunes pre-trained
video foundation model on robot datasets along with internet human manipulation
data. The subsequent policy learning module (System 1) generates fluid motor
actions in real time. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that TriVLA operates
at approximately 36 Hz and surpasses state-of-the-art imitation learning
baselines on standard simulation benchmarks as well as challenging real-world
manipulation tasks.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel funnel-based tracking control algorithm for

Euler-Lagrange formulation, a common modeling approach for robotic systems, has
been adopted in this study to address the trade-off between performance and
actuator safety. We establish feasibility conditions that ensure tracking
errors evolve within predefined funnel bounds while maintaining bounded control
efforts, a crucial consideration for robots with limited actuation
capabilities. We propose two approximation-free control strategies for
scenarios where these conditions are violated: one actively corrects the error,
and the other stops further deviation. Finally, we demonstrate the robust
performance and safety of the approach through simulations and experimental
validations. This work represents a significant advancement in funnel-based
control, enhancing its applicability to real-world robotics systems with input
constraints.

Motivation: 当前LLMs和VLMs在生物研究中的应用受限于僵化的协议设计、动态实验室条件的适应性不足、错误处理能力有限以及操作复杂性高。

Method: BioMARS采用分层架构：Biologist Agent通过检索增强生成合成协议；Technician Agent将其转化为可执行的机器人伪代码；Inspector Agent通过多模态感知和异常检测确保程序完整性。

Conclusion: BioMARS展示了通用化AI驱动实验室自动化的可行性，以及语言推理在生物研究中的变革性作用。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) have the
potential to transform biological research by enabling autonomous
experimentation. Yet, their application remains constrained by rigid protocol
design, limited adaptability to dynamic lab conditions, inadequate error
handling, and high operational complexity. Here we introduce BioMARS
(Biological Multi-Agent Robotic System), an intelligent platform that
integrates LLMs, VLMs, and modular robotics to autonomously design, plan, and
execute biological experiments. BioMARS uses a hierarchical architecture: the
Biologist Agent synthesizes protocols via retrieval-augmented generation; the
Technician Agent translates them into executable robotic pseudo-code; and the
Inspector Agent ensures procedural integrity through multimodal perception and
anomaly detection. The system autonomously conducts cell passaging and culture
tasks, matching or exceeding manual performance in viability, consistency, and
morphological integrity. It also supports context-aware optimization,
outperforming conventional strategies in differentiating retinal pigment
epithelial cells. A web interface enables real-time human-AI collaboration,
while a modular backend allows scalable integration with laboratory hardware.
These results highlight the feasibility of generalizable, AI-driven laboratory
automation and the transformative role of language-based reasoning in
biological research.

Abstract: With the rapid development of more complex robots, Fault Detection and
Diagnosis (FDD) becomes increasingly harder. Especially the need for
predetermined models and historic data is problematic because they do not
encompass the dynamic and fast-changing nature of such systems. To this end, we
propose a concept that actively generates a dynamic system model at runtime and
utilizes it to locate root causes. The goal is to be applicable to all kinds of
robotic systems that share a similar software design. Additionally, it should
exhibit minimal overhead and enhance independence from expert attention.

Result: 夹具能够抓取小至其孔径54.5%的物体（如鸡蛋），并达到94.3的最大负载质量比。

Conclusion: 混合夹具展示了在自适应抓取中的高效性和灵活性，适用于工业应用。

Abstract: Shape-morphing robots have shown benefits in industrial grasping. We propose
form-flexible grippers for adaptive grasping. The design is based on the hybrid
jamming and suction mechanism, which deforms to handle objects that vary
significantly in size from the aperture, including both larger and smaller
parts. Compared with traditional grippers, the gripper achieves self-closing to
form an airtight seal. Under a vacuum, a wide range of grasping is realized
through the passive morphing mechanism at the interface that harmonizes
pressure and flow rate. This hybrid gripper showcases the capability to
securely grasp an egg, as small as 54.5% of its aperture, while achieving a
maximum load-to-mass ratio of 94.3.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于黎曼度量的模型，用于解决高维空间中二维光滑子流形上的最优路径规划问题，通过构造新的黎曼度量将问题转化为二维平面上的几何问题，并提出了增量算法RRT*-R。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决高维空间中机器人路径规划的复杂性问题，尤其是在环境因素（如高度变化、地面阻力）不均匀的场景下。

Method: 在高维空间中构造二维投影平面的新黎曼度量，并基于此提出增量算法RRT*-R。

Result: 实验表明，RRT*-R算法在复杂环境中表现优异，路径平滑且优化性能优于原始RRT*算法，路径长度接近理论最小测地距离。

Conclusion: RRT*-R算法为高维空间中的路径规划提供了一种有效且优化的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper presents a Riemannian metric-based model to solve the optimal path
planning problem on two-dimensional smooth submanifolds in high-dimensional
space. Our model is based on constructing a new Riemannian metric on a
two-dimensional projection plane, which is induced by the high-dimensional
Euclidean metric on two-dimensional smooth submanifold and reflects the
environmental information of the robot. The optimal path planning problem in
high-dimensional space is therefore transformed into a geometric problem on the
two-dimensional plane with new Riemannian metric. Based on the new Riemannian
metric, we proposed an incremental algorithm RRT*-R on the projection plane.
The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is suitable for
scenarios with uneven fields in multiple dimensions. The proposed algorithm can
help the robot to effectively avoid areas with drastic changes in height,
ground resistance and other environmental factors. More importantly, the RRT*-R
algorithm shows better smoothness and optimization properties compared with the
original RRT* algorithm using Euclidean distance in high-dimensional workspace.
The length of the entire path by RRT*-R is a good approximation of the
theoretical minimum geodesic distance on projection plane.

Method: 设计了一种专门利用机械臂细长结构的碰撞检测算法，替代传统的球体分解方法。

Result: 算法在真实LiDAR数据和模拟环境中验证了其有效性，提高了计算效率。

Conclusion: 该算法为细长机械臂的运动规划提供了更高效和准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Collision-free motion planning in complex outdoor environments relies heavily
on perceiving the surroundings through exteroceptive sensors. A widely used
approach represents the environment as a voxelized Euclidean distance field,
where robots are typically approximated by spheres. However, for large-scale
manipulators such as forestry cranes, which feature long and slender links,
this conventional spherical approximation becomes inefficient and inaccurate.
This work presents a novel collision detection algorithm specifically designed
to exploit the elongated structure of such manipulators, significantly
enhancing the computational efficiency of motion planning algorithms. Unlike
traditional sphere decomposition methods, our approach not only improves
computational efficiency but also naturally eliminates the need to fine-tune
the approximation accuracy as an additional parameter. We validate the
algorithm's effectiveness using real-world LiDAR data from a forestry crane
application, as well as simulated environment data.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种SE(3)等变的扩散策略（SDP），通过在球面傅里叶空间中嵌入状态、动作和去噪过程，实现了对3D场景变换的适应性，显著提升了泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散策略在从人类演示中学习闭环操作策略时表现良好，但在面对3D空间中物体新排列时泛化能力较差，影响了实际性能。

Method: 提出SDP，利用球面傅里叶空间嵌入和球面FiLM层，构建了一个时空等变的去噪U-net，实现了端到端的SE(3)等变性。

Result: 在20个仿真任务和5个物理机器人任务中，SDP表现优于基线方法。

Conclusion: SDP通过SE(3)等变性显著提升了在3D场景变换下的泛化能力，适用于单臂和双臂机器人任务。

Abstract: Diffusion Policies are effective at learning closed-loop manipulation
policies from human demonstrations but generalize poorly to novel arrangements
of objects in 3D space, hurting real-world performance. To address this issue,
we propose Spherical Diffusion Policy (SDP), an SE(3) equivariant diffusion
policy that adapts trajectories according to 3D transformations of the scene.
Such equivariance is achieved by embedding the states, actions, and the
denoising process in spherical Fourier space. Additionally, we employ novel
spherical FiLM layers to condition the action denoising process equivariantly
on the scene embeddings. Lastly, we propose a spherical denoising temporal
U-net that achieves spatiotemporal equivariance with computational efficiency.
In the end, SDP is end-to-end SE(3) equivariant, allowing robust generalization
across transformed 3D scenes. SDP demonstrates a large performance improvement
over strong baselines in 20 simulation tasks and 5 physical robot tasks
including single-arm and bi-manual embodiments. Code is available at

Motivation: 解决脊柱固定手术中刚性椎弓根螺钉的松动和拔出限制，并利用新开发的同心管可转向钻孔机器人（CT-SDR）和柔性椎弓根螺钉（FPS）技术。

Method: 使用CT-SDR在椎弓根上钻孔形成J形隧道，植入FPS并通过其空心部分注入骨水泥，形成增强桥接结构。

Conclusion: AB-SF技术具有可行性，能够增强脊柱固定强度。

Abstract: To address the screw loosening and pullout limitations of rigid pedicle
screws in spinal fixation procedures, and to leverage our recently developed
Concentric Tube Steerable Drilling Robot (CT-SDR) and Flexible Pedicle Screw
(FPS), in this paper, we introduce the concept of Augmented Bridge Spinal
Fixation (AB-SF). In this concept, two connecting J-shape tunnels are first
drilled through pedicles of vertebra using the CT-SDR. Next, two FPSs are
passed through this tunnel and bone cement is then injected through the
cannulated region of the FPS to form an augmented bridge between two pedicles
and reinforce strength of the fixated spine. To experimentally analyze and
study the feasibility of AB-SF technique, we first used our robotic system
(i.e., a CT-SDR integrated with a robotic arm) to create two different fixation
scenarios in which two J-shape tunnels, forming a bridge, were drilled at
different depth of a vertebral phantom. Next, we implanted two FPSs within the
drilled tunnels and then successfully simulated the bone cement augmentation
process.

robotic manipulator. The functionality of this framework is validated through
planar and out-of-plane steerable drilling experiments in vertebral phantoms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统刚性钻孔工具限制了螺钉的放置路径，导致手术并发症增加，如螺钉错位、手术时间延长和辐射暴露增加。

Method: 设计并开发了一种4自由度的骨盆同心管可转向钻孔机器人，能够实现S形钻孔路径，适应骨盆的自然曲率。

Result: 通过模拟骨模型的S形钻孔实验，验证了pelvic CT-SDR的性能。

Conclusion: pelvic CT-SDR能够优化螺钉放置路径，减少手术并发症，提高手术安全性。

Abstract: Current pelvic fixation techniques rely on rigid drilling tools, which
inherently constrain the placement of rigid medical screws in the complex
anatomy of pelvis. These constraints prevent medical screws from following
anatomically optimal pathways and force clinicians to fixate screws in linear
trajectories. This suboptimal approach, combined with the unnatural placement
of the excessively long screws, lead to complications such as screw
misplacement, extended surgery times, and increased radiation exposure due to
repeated X-ray images taken ensure to safety of procedure. To address these
challenges, in this paper, we present the design and development of a unique 4
degree-of-freedom (DoF) pelvic concentric tube steerable drilling robot (pelvic
CT-SDR). The pelvic CT-SDR is capable of creating long S-shaped drilling
trajectories that follow the natural curvatures of the pelvic anatomy. The
performance of the pelvic CT-SDR was thoroughly evaluated through several
S-shape drilling experiments in simulated bone phantoms.

TL;DR: MoIRA是一个模块化的Mixture-of-Experts框架，通过外部文本路由协调专家模型，支持零样本路由，在机器人任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统MoE架构中路由机制缺乏灵活性和需要额外训练的问题，提供更高效、可扩展的多专家系统解决方案。

Method: 提出MoIRA框架，采用嵌入相似性和提示驱动的语言模型推理两种零样本路由方式，结合低秩适配器进行低开销推理。

Result: 在GR1 Humanoid和LIBERO基准测试中优于通用模型，与其他MoE方案竞争，且对指令变化具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: MoIRA展示了模块化部署的实用性，为未来多专家机器人系统提供了可扩展的基础。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) approaches have recently gained traction in robotics
applications due to their ability to dynamically allocate computational
resources and specialize sub-networks for distinct tasks or environmental
contexts, enabling more efficient decision-making. Such systems often comprise
sparsely activated experts combined under a single monolithic architecture and
require a well-configured internal routing mechanism, which does not allow for
selective low-level expert and router customization and requires additional
training. We propose MoIRA, an architecture-agnostic modular MoE framework
designed to coordinate existing experts with an external text-based router.
MoIRA incorporates two zero-shot routing options: embedding-based similarity
and prompt-driven language model inference. In our experiments, we choose large
Vision-Language-Action models, gr00t-N1 and $\pi_0$, as the underlying experts,
and train low-rank adapters for low-overhead inference. We evaluate MoIRA on
various GR1 Humanoid tasks and LIBERO Spatial and Goal benchmarks, where it
consistently outperforms generalist models and competes with other MoE
pipelines. Additionally, we analyse the robustness of the proposed approach to
the variations of the instructions. While relying solely on textual
descriptions of tasks and experts, MoIRA demonstrates the practical viability
of modular deployment with precise, low-effort routing and provides an
alternative, scalable foundation for future multi-expert robotic systems.

Abstract: Dexterous teleoperation plays a crucial role in robotic manipulation for
real-world data collection and remote robot control. Previous dexterous
teleoperation mostly relies on hand retargeting to closely mimic human hand
postures. However, these approaches may fail to fully leverage the inherent
dexterity of dexterous hands, which can execute unique actions through their
structural advantages compared to human hands. To address this limitation, we
propose TypeTele, a type-guided dexterous teleoperation system, which enables
dexterous hands to perform actions that are not constrained by human motion
patterns. This is achieved by introducing dexterous manipulation types into the
teleoperation system, allowing operators to employ appropriate types to
complete specific tasks. To support this system, we build an extensible
dexterous manipulation type library to cover comprehensive dexterous postures
used in manipulation tasks. During teleoperation, we employ a MLLM
(Multi-modality Large Language Model)-assisted type retrieval module to
identify the most suitable manipulation type based on the specific task and
operator commands. Extensive experiments of real-world teleoperation and
imitation learning demonstrate that the incorporation of manipulation types
significantly takes full advantage of the dexterous robot's ability to perform
diverse and complex tasks with higher success rates.

Abstract: The remarkable advancements of vision and language foundation models in
multimodal understanding, reasoning, and generation has sparked growing efforts
to extend such intelligence to the physical world, fueling the flourishing of
vision-language-action (VLA) models. Despite seemingly diverse approaches, we
observe that current VLA models can be unified under a single framework: vision
and language inputs are processed by a series of VLA modules, producing a chain
of \textit{action tokens} that progressively encode more grounded and
actionable information, ultimately generating executable actions. We further
determine that the primary design choice distinguishing VLA models lies in how
action tokens are formulated, which can be categorized into language
description, code, affordance, trajectory, goal state, latent representation,
raw action, and reasoning. However, there remains a lack of comprehensive
understanding regarding action tokens, significantly impeding effective VLA
development and obscuring future directions. Therefore, this survey aims to
categorize and interpret existing VLA research through the lens of action
tokenization, distill the strengths and limitations of each token type, and
identify areas for improvement. Through this systematic review and analysis, we
offer a synthesized outlook on the broader evolution of VLA models, highlight
underexplored yet promising directions, and contribute guidance for future
research, hoping to bring the field closer to general-purpose intelligence.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized robotic autonomy, including
Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). Recent studies have demonstrated the potential
of LLMs for translating human instructions into executable control code for UAV
operations. However, LLMs still face challenges from logical reasoning and
complex decision-making, leading to concerns about the reliability of
LLM-driven UAV operations. In this paper, we propose a LLM-driven closed-loop
control framework that enables reliable UAV operations powered by effective
feedback and refinement using two LLM modules, i.e., a Code Generator and an
Evaluator. Our framework transforms numerical state observations from UAV
operations into natural language trajectory descriptions to enhance the
evaluator LLM's understanding of UAV dynamics for precise feedback generation.
Our framework also enables a simulation-based refinement process, and hence
eliminates the risks to physical UAVs caused by incorrect code execution during
the refinement. Extensive experiments on UAV control tasks with different
complexities are conducted. The experimental results show that our framework
can achieve reliable UAV operations using LLMs, which significantly outperforms
baseline approaches in terms of success rate and completeness with the increase
of task complexity.

Abstract: Recently, mobile manipulation has attracted increasing attention for enabling
language-conditioned robotic control in household tasks. However, existing
methods still face challenges in coordinating mobile base and manipulator,
primarily due to two limitations. On the one hand, they fail to explicitly
model the influence of the mobile base on manipulator control, which easily
leads to error accumulation under high degrees of freedom. On the other hand,
they treat the entire mobile manipulation process with the same visual
observation modality (e.g., either all 2D or all 3D), overlooking the distinct
multimodal perception requirements at different stages during mobile
manipulation. To address this, we propose the Adaptive Coordination Diffusion
Transformer (AC-DiT), which enhances mobile base and manipulator coordination
for end-to-end mobile manipulation. First, since the motion of the mobile base
directly influences the manipulator's actions, we introduce a mobility-to-body
conditioning mechanism that guides the model to first extract base motion
representations, which are then used as context prior for predicting whole-body
actions. This enables whole-body control that accounts for the potential impact
of the mobile base's motion. Second, to meet the perception requirements at
different stages of mobile manipulation, we design a perception-aware
multimodal conditioning strategy that dynamically adjusts the fusion weights
between various 2D visual images and 3D point clouds, yielding visual features
tailored to the current perceptual needs. This allows the model to, for
example, adaptively rely more on 2D inputs when semantic information is crucial
for action prediction, while placing greater emphasis on 3D geometric
information when precise spatial understanding is required. We validate AC-DiT
through extensive experiments on both simulated and real-world mobile
manipulation tasks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统生成式零样本学习方法需要大量计算资源和合成数据，违背了零样本学习的初衷。FSIGenZ旨在减少这种依赖，同时处理属性在实例层面的变异性。

Method: 提出Model-Specific Attribute Scoring (MSAS)动态调整属性评分，估计组级原型作为未见类的代表特征，并使用Dual-Purpose Semantic Regularization (DPSR)策略训练语义感知对比分类器。

Result: 在SUN、AwA2和CUB基准测试中，FSIGenZ使用更少的合成特征实现了竞争性性能。

Conclusion: FSIGenZ通过动态属性评分和原型估计，有效减少了生成式零样本学习对大规模合成的依赖，同时保持了高性能。

Abstract: Generative zero-shot learning (ZSL) methods typically synthesize visual
features for unseen classes using predefined semantic attributes, followed by
training a fully supervised classification model. While effective, these
methods require substantial computational resources and extensive synthetic
data, thereby relaxing the original ZSL assumptions. In this paper, we propose
FSIGenZ, a few-shot-inspired generative ZSL framework that reduces reliance on
large-scale feature synthesis. Our key insight is that class-level attributes
exhibit instance-level variability, i.e., some attributes may be absent or
partially visible, yet conventional ZSL methods treat them as uniformly
present. To address this, we introduce Model-Specific Attribute Scoring (MSAS),
which dynamically re-scores class attributes based on model-specific
optimization to approximate instance-level variability without access to unseen
data. We further estimate group-level prototypes as clusters of instances based
on MSAS-adjusted attribute scores, which serve as representative synthetic
features for each unseen class. To mitigate the resulting data imbalance, we
introduce a Dual-Purpose Semantic Regularization (DPSR) strategy while training
a semantic-aware contrastive classifier (SCC) using these prototypes.
Experiments on SUN, AwA2, and CUB benchmarks demonstrate that FSIGenZ achieves
competitive performance using far fewer synthetic features.

Method: 采用LTDB算法，将单钟权重分布转换为双钟形式以减少二值化误差，并通过逆变换平滑激活。

Result: 在Wikitext2数据集上，DBellQuant在LLaMA2-13B上实现了14.39的困惑度，显著优于BiLLM的21.35。

Conclusion: DBellQuant在激进量化的同时保持了模型性能，为LLMs的实际应用提供了高效压缩方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable performance but face
substantial computational and memory challenges that limit their practical
deployment. Quantization has emerged as a promising solution; however, its
effectiveness is often limited by quantization errors arising from weight
distributions that are not quantization-friendly and the presence of activation
outliers. To address these challenges, we introduce DBellQuant, an innovative
post-training quantization (PTQ) framework that achieves nearly 1-bit weight
compression and 6-bit activation quantization with minimal performance
degradation. DBellQuant uses Learnable Transformation for Dual-Bell (LTDB)
algorithm, which transforms single-bell weight distributions into dual-bell
forms to reduce binarization errors and applies inverse transformations to
smooth activations. DBellQuant sets a new state-of-the-art by preserving
superior model performance under aggressive weight and activation quantization.
For example, on the Wikitext2 dataset, DBellQuant achieves a perplexity of
14.39 on LLaMA2-13B with 6-bit activation quantization, significantly
outperforming BiLLM's 21.35 without activation quantization, underscoring its
potential in compressing LLMs for real-world applications.

Motivation: 探索非对比自监督学习中避免表征崩溃的优化和动态系统理论。

Method: 从优化和动态系统理论角度分析停止梯度和指数移动平均的作用。

Result: 证明这些方法能避免崩溃，且极限点是稳定的。

Conclusion: 停止梯度和指数移动平均在非对比自监督学习中有效避免崩溃，并具有稳定性。

Abstract: The objective of non-contrastive approaches to self-supervised learning is to
train on pairs of different views of the data an encoder and a predictor that
minimize the mean discrepancy between the code predicted from the embedding of
the first view and the embedding of the second one. In this setting, the stop
gradient and exponential moving average iterative procedures are commonly used
to avoid representation collapse, with excellent performance in downstream
supervised applications. This presentation investigates these procedures from
the dual theoretical viewpoints of optimization and dynamical systems. We first
show that, in general, although they do not optimize the original objective, or
for that matter, any other smooth function, they do avoid collapse. Following
Tian et al. [2021], but without any of the extra assumptions used in their
proofs, we then show using a dynamical system perspective that, in the linear
case, minimizing the original objective function without the use of a stop
gradient or exponential moving average always leads to collapse. Conversely, we
finally show that the limit points of the dynamical systems associated with
these two procedures are, in general, asymptotically stable equilibria, with no
risk of degenerating to trivial solutions.

Motivation: 现有MLLMs在病理视觉推理任务中表现不佳，主要因缺乏领域知识和推理步骤引入错误。

Method: PathCoT结合病理学专家知识和自评估机制，优化CoT推理过程。

Result: 在PathMMU数据集上验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: PathCoT显著提升了病理视觉推理任务的准确性。

Abstract: With the development of generative artificial intelligence and instruction
tuning techniques, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made
impressive progress on general reasoning tasks. Benefiting from the
chain-of-thought (CoT) methodology, MLLMs can solve the visual reasoning
problem step-by-step. However, existing MLLMs still face significant challenges
when applied to pathology visual reasoning tasks: (1) LLMs often underperforms
because they lack domain-specific information, which can lead to model
hallucinations. (2) The additional reasoning steps in CoT may introduce errors,
leading to the divergence of answers. To address these limitations, we propose
PathCoT, a novel zero-shot CoT prompting method which integrates the pathology
expert-knowledge into the reasoning process of MLLMs and incorporates
self-evaluation to mitigate divergence of answers. Specifically, PathCoT guides
the MLLM with prior knowledge to perform as pathology experts, and provides
comprehensive analysis of the image with their domain-specific knowledge. By
incorporating the experts' knowledge, PathCoT can obtain the answers with CoT
reasoning. Furthermore, PathCoT incorporates a self-evaluation step that
assesses both the results generated directly by MLLMs and those derived through
CoT, finally determining the reliable answer. The experimental results on the
PathMMU dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on pathology visual
understanding and reasoning.

Abstract: In chemistry tabulations and Flamelet combustion models, the Flamelet
Generated Manifold (FGM) is recognized for its precision and physical
representation. The practical implementation of FGM requires a significant
allocation of memory resources. FGM libraries are developed specifically for a
specific fuel and subsequently utilized for all numerical problems using
machine learning techniques. This research aims to develop libraries of Laminar
FGM utilizing machine learning algorithms for application in combustion
simulations of methane fuel. This study employs four Machine Learning
algorithms to regenerate Flamelet libraries, based on an understanding of data
sources, techniques, and data-driven concepts. 1. Multi-Layer Perceptron; 2.
Random Forest; 3. Linear Regression; 4. Support Vector Machine. Seven libraries
were identified as appropriate for constructing a database for training machine
learning models, giving an error rate of 2.30%. The default architectures of
each method were evaluated to determine the optimal approach, leading to the
selection of the MLP method as the primary choice. The method was enhanced
through hyperparameter tuning to improve accuracy. The quantity of hidden
layers and neurons significantly influences method performance. The optimal
model, comprising four hidden layers with 10, 15, 20, and 25 neurons
respectively, achieved an accuracy of 99.81%.

Conclusion: 研究为几何学习在非CUDA硬件上的应用提供了基础，促进了跨平台可移植性和进一步优化。

Abstract: Geometric learning has emerged as a powerful paradigm for modeling
non-Euclidean data, especially graph-structured ones, with applications
spanning social networks, molecular structures, knowledge graphs, and
recommender systems. While Nvidia's CUDA-enabled graphics processing units
(GPUs) largely dominate the hardware landscape, emerging accelerators such as
Intel's Gaudi Habana Processing Units (HPUs) offer competitive performance and
energy efficiency. However, the usage of such non-CUDA processing units
requires significant engineering effort and novel software adaptations. In this
work, we present our experiences porting PyTorch-based geometric learning
frameworks to Gaudi-v2 HPUs. We introduce a collection of core utilities that
restore essential operations (e.g., scatter, sparse indexing, k-nearest
neighbors) on Gaudi-v2 HPUs, and we consolidate sixteen guided tutorials and
eleven real-world examples with diagnostic analyses of encountered failures and
detailed workarounds. We collect all our experiences into a publicly accessible
GitHub repository. Our contributions lower the barrier for researchers to
experiment with geometric-learning algorithms and models on non-CUDA hardware,
providing a foundation for further optimization and cross-platform portability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多组学分析成本高昂且可能导致资源浪费，因此需要一种方法在保证诊断准确性的同时减少冗余测试。

Method: 在单组学层面，通过改进神经网络激活函数生成Dirichlet分布参数，量化分类结果的置信度和不确定性；在多组学层面，基于Dempster-Shafer理论融合异构模态，动态决策机制逐步引入数据直至满足置信度阈值。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上测试，超过50%的案例仅需单组学数据即可准确分类，显著减少冗余测试，同时保持与全组学模型相当的诊断性能。

Conclusion: 该方法在降低测试成本的同时，保持了高诊断准确性和生物学意义，为多组学分析提供了经济高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Background and Objective: High-throughput multi-omics technologies have
proven invaluable for elucidating disease mechanisms and enabling early
diagnosis. However, the high cost of multi-omics profiling imposes a
significant economic burden, with over reliance on full omics data potentially
leading to unnecessary resource consumption. To address these issues, we
propose an uncertainty-aware, multi-view dynamic decision framework for omics
data classification that aims to achieve high diagnostic accuracy while
minimizing testing costs. Methodology: At the single-omics level, we refine the
activation functions of neural networks to generate Dirichlet distribution
parameters, utilizing subjective logic to quantify both the belief masses and
uncertainty mass of classification results. Belief mass reflects the support of
a specific omics modality for a disease class, while the uncertainty parameter
captures limitations in data quality and model discriminability, providing a
more trustworthy basis for decision-making. At the multi omics level, we employ
a fusion strategy based on Dempster-Shafer theory to integrate heterogeneous
modalities, leveraging their complementarity to boost diagnostic accuracy and
robustness. A dynamic decision mechanism is then applied that omics data are
incrementally introduced for each patient until either all data sources are
utilized or the model confidence exceeds a predefined threshold, potentially
before all data sources are utilized. Results and Conclusion: We evaluate our
approach on four benchmark multi-omics datasets, ROSMAP, LGG, BRCA, and KIPAN.
In three datasets, over 50% of cases achieved accurate classification using a
single omics modality, effectively reducing redundant testing. Meanwhile, our
method maintains diagnostic performance comparable to full-omics models and
preserves essential biological insights.

Conclusion: 优化的LSTM框架为政策制定者和电网运营商提供了实用的预测工具，适用于数据稀缺且不稳定的地区。

Abstract: Accurate electricity forecasting is crucial for grid stability and energy
planning, especially in Benghazi, Libya, where frequent load shedding,
generation deficits, and infrastructure limitations persist. This study
proposes a data-driven approach to forecast electricity load, generation, and
deficits for 2025 using historical data from 2019 (a year marked by
instability) and 2023 (a more stable year). Multiple time series models were
applied, including ARIMA, seasonal ARIMA, dynamic regression ARIMA, exponential
smoothing, extreme gradient boosting, and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural
networks. The dataset was enhanced through missing value imputation, outlier
smoothing, and log transformation. Performance was assessed using mean squared
error, root mean squared error, mean absolute error, and mean absolute
percentage error. LSTM outperformed all other models, showing strong
capabilities in modeling non-stationary and seasonal patterns. A key
contribution of this work is an optimized LSTM framework that integrates
exogenous factors such as temperature and humidity, offering robust performance
in forecasting multiple electricity indicators. These results provide practical
insights for policymakers and grid operators to enable proactive load
management and resource planning in data-scarce, volatile regions.

Conclusion: 硬件-软件协同设计和参数高效调优使混合模型优于独立GNN或LLM方法，推荐FPGA和LoRA用于实时部署，未来可探索联邦学习和融合架构。

Abstract: The incessant advent of online services demands high speed and efficient
recommender systems (ReS) that can maintain real-time performance along with
processing very complex user-item interactions. The present study, therefore,
considers computational bottlenecks involved in hybrid Graph Neural Network
(GNN) and Large Language Model (LLM)-based ReS with the aim optimizing their
inference latency and training efficiency. An extensive methodology was used:
hybrid GNN-LLM integrated architecture-optimization strategies(quantization,
LoRA, distillation)-hardware acceleration (FPGA, DeepSpeed)-all under R 4.4.2.
Experimental improvements were significant, with the optimal Hybrid + FPGA +
DeepSpeed configuration reaching 13.6% more accuracy (NDCG@10: 0.75) at 40-60ms
of latency, while LoRA brought down training time by 66% (3.8 hours) in
comparison to the non-optimized baseline. Irrespective of domain, such as
accuracy or efficiency, it can be established that hardware-software co-design
and parameter-efficient tuning permit hybrid models to outperform GNN or LLM
approaches implemented independently. It recommends the use of FPGA as well as
LoRA for real-time deployment. Future work should involve federated learning
along with advanced fusion architectures for better scalability and privacy
preservation. Thus, this research marks the fundamental groundwork concerning
next-generation ReS balancing low-latency response with cutting-edge
personalization.

Motivation: 迭代求解器在解决大规模VRP时存在冗余计算问题，因为大部分解在搜索过程中保持稳定。

Method: 提出FSTA技术保留稳定解段，并通过L2Seg智能识别稳定与不稳定部分。L2Seg有三种变体：非自回归、自回归及其协同。

Result: 实验表明，L2Seg将最先进迭代求解器的速度提升高达7倍。

Conclusion: L2Seg是一个灵活框架，适用于多种VRP求解器，并能结合非自回归与自回归的优势。

Abstract: Iterative search heuristics are widely recognized as state-of-the-art for
solving Vehicle Routing Problems (VRPs). In this work, we identify and exploit
a critical observation: within these solvers, a large portion of the solution
remains stable, i.e., unchanged across search iterations, causing redundant
computations, especially for large-scale VRPs with long subtours. To address
this, we pioneer the formal study of the First-Segment-Then-Aggregate (FSTA)
decomposition technique to accelerate iterative solvers. Specifically, FSTA
preserves stable solution segments during the search, aggregates nodes within
each segment into fixed hypernodes, and focuses the search only on unstable
portions. Yet, a key challenge lies in identifying which segments should be
aggregated by FSTA. To this end, we then introduce Learning-to-Segment (L2Seg),
a novel neural framework to intelligently differentiate potentially stable and
unstable portions for FSTA decomposition. We present three L2Seg variants:
non-autoregressive (globally comprehensive but locally indiscriminate),
autoregressive (locally refined but globally deficient), and their synergy,
with bespoke training and inference strategies. Empirical results on CVRP and
VRPTW suggest that L2Seg accelerates state-of-the-art iterative solvers by up
to 7x. Additionally, we provide in-depth analysis showing NAR and AR synergy
achieves best performance by combining their complementary strengths. Notably,
L2Seg is a flexible framework that is compatible with traditional,
learning-based, and hybrid solvers, while supporting a broad class of VRPs.

Result: PPO训练的模糊控制器在20000次更新后平均回报达500，方差更小且收敛更快。

Conclusion: PPO为训练可解释的神经模糊控制器提供了有前景的途径。

Abstract: We propose a reinforcement learning (RL) approach for training neuro-fuzzy
controllers using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). Building on prior work
that applied Deep Q-Learning to Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference Systems (ANFIS),
our method replaces the off-policy value-based framework with a stable
on-policy actor-critic loop. We evaluate this approach in the CartPole-v1
environment using multiple random seeds and compare its learning performance
against ANFIS-Deep Q-Network (DQN) baselines. It was found that PPO-trained
fuzzy agents achieved a mean return of 500 +/- 0 on CartPole-v1 after 20000
updates, showcasing less variance than prior DQN-based methods during training
and overall faster convergence. These findings suggest that PPO offers a
promising pathway for training explainable neuro-fuzzy controllers in
reinforcement learning tasks.

Abstract: Split learning (SL) has emerged as a computationally efficient approach for
artificial intelligence (AI) model training, which can alleviate device-side
computational workloads. However, complex AI model architectures pose high
computational complexity to obtain the optimal model splitting. In this paper,
we represent an arbitrary AI model as a directed acyclic graph (DAG), and then
reformulate the optimal model splitting problem as a minimum s-t cut search
problem. To solve the problem, we propose a fast DAG-based model splitting
algorithm, which restructures the DAG to enable the optimal model splitting
identification via a maximum flow method. Theoretical analysis indicates that
the proposed algorithm is optimal. Furthermore, considering AI models with
block structures, we propose a block-wise model splitting algorithm to reduce
computational complexity. The algorithm abstracts each block, i.e., a component
consisting of multiple layers, into a single vertex, thereby obtaining the
optimal model splitting via a simplified DAG. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed algorithms can determine the optimal model
splitting within milliseconds, as well as reduce training delay by
24.62%-38.95% in dynamic edge networks as compared to the state-of-the-art
benchmarks.

Abstract: The issue of data-driven neural network model construction is one of the core
problems in the domain of Artificial Intelligence. A standard approach assumes
a fixed architecture with trainable weights. A conceptually more advanced
assumption is that we not only train the weights, but also find out the optimal
model architecture. We present a new method that realizes just that. This
article is an extended version of our conference paper titled "Dynamic Growing
and Shrinking of Neural Networks with Monte Carlo Tree Search [26]". In the
paper, we show in detail how to create a neural network with a procedure that
allows dynamic shrinking and growing of the model while it is being trained.
The decision-making mechanism for the architectural design is governed by a
Monte Carlo tree search procedure which simulates network behavior and allows
to compare several candidate architecture changes to choose the best one. The
proposed method was validated using both visual and time series datasets,
demonstrating its particular effectiveness in multivariate time series
classification. This is attributed to the architecture's ability to adapt
dynamically, allowing independent modifications for each time series. The
approach is supplemented by Python source code for reproducibility.
Experimental evaluations in visual pattern and multivariate time series
classification tasks revealed highly promising performance, underscoring the
method's robustness and adaptability.

Motivation: 传统深度学习方法依赖同质数据集和静态定制模型，限制了其在多样化临床环境和采集协议中的鲁棒性和泛化性。

Method: 采用Transformer架构和生成式掩码预训练策略，整合多模态数据（包括MIMIC-III-WDB、MIMIC-IV-ECG和CODE数据集），覆盖约170万个体的心脏信号及临床或机器生成文本报告。

Result: CSFM的嵌入表征在多样化心脏感知场景中表现优异，支持跨输入配置和传感器模态的无缝迁移学习，在诊断任务、人口统计信息识别、生命体征测量、临床结果预测和ECG问答中均优于传统单模态单任务方法。

Conclusion: CSFM作为一种多功能、可扩展的解决方案，展现了全面心脏监测的潜力。

Abstract: Cardiac biosignals, such as electrocardiograms (ECG) and photoplethysmograms
(PPG), are of paramount importance for the diagnosis, prevention, and
management of cardiovascular diseases, and have been extensively used in a
variety of clinical tasks. Conventional deep learning approaches for analyzing
these signals typically rely on homogeneous datasets and static bespoke models,
limiting their robustness and generalizability across diverse clinical settings
and acquisition protocols. In this study, we present a cardiac sensing
foundation model (CSFM) that leverages advanced transformer architectures and a
generative, masked pretraining strategy to learn unified representations from
vast, heterogeneous health records. Our model is pretrained on an innovative
multi-modal integration of data from multiple large-scale datasets (including
MIMIC-III-WDB, MIMIC-IV-ECG, and CODE), comprising cardiac signals and the
corresponding clinical or machine-generated text reports from approximately 1.7
million individuals. We demonstrate that the embeddings derived from our CSFM
not only serve as effective feature extractors across diverse cardiac sensing
scenarios, but also enable seamless transfer learning across varying input
configurations and sensor modalities. Extensive evaluations across diagnostic
tasks, demographic information recognition, vital sign measurement, clinical
outcome prediction, and ECG question answering reveal that CSFM consistently
outperforms traditional one-modal-one-task approaches. Notably, CSFM exhibits
robust performance across multiple ECG lead configurations from standard
12-lead systems to single-lead setups, and in scenarios where only ECG, only
PPG, or a combination thereof is available. These findings highlight the
potential of CSFM as a versatile and scalable solution, for comprehensive
cardiac monitoring.

Motivation: 当前数字孪生（DT）在复杂能源资产中的应用缺乏清晰的信息交换框架、实时实现的关键特性或对模型不确定性的关注。

Method: 提出VDT框架，通过在标准神经架构中增加贝叶斯输出层和新型更新算法，实现快速更新和不确定性校准。

Conclusion: VDT通过轻量级的贝叶斯增强和高效更新方案，将传统模型转化为具有不确定性感知、数据高效且计算可行的数字孪生，为能源系统提供了可靠的模型支持。

Abstract: While digital twins (DT) hold promise for providing real-time insights into
complex energy assets, much of the current literature either does not offer a
clear framework for information exchange between the model and the asset, lacks
key features needed for real-time implementation, or gives limited attention to
model uncertainty. Here, we aim to solve these gaps by proposing a variational
digital twin (VDT) framework that augments standard neural architectures with a
single Bayesian output layer. This lightweight addition, along with a novel VDT
updating algorithm, lets a twin update in seconds on commodity GPUs while
producing calibrated uncertainty bounds that can inform experiment design,
control algorithms, and model reliability. The VDT is evaluated on four
energy-sector problems. For critical-heat-flux prediction, uncertainty-driven
active learning reaches R2 = 0.98 using 47 % fewer experiments and one-third
the training time of random sampling. A three-year renewable-generation twin
maintains R2 > 0.95 for solar output and curbs error growth for volatile wind
forecasts via monthly updates that process only one month of data at a time. A
nuclear reactor transient cooldown twin reconstructs thermocouple signals with
R2 > 0.99 and preserves accuracy after 50 % sensor loss, demonstrating
robustness to degraded instrumentation. Finally, a physics-informed Li-ion
battery twin, retrained after every ten discharges, lowers voltage mean-squared
error by an order of magnitude relative to the best static model while adapting
its credible intervals as the cell approaches end-of-life. These results
demonstrate that combining modest Bayesian augmentation with efficient update
schemes turns conventional surrogates into uncertainty-aware, data-efficient,
and computationally tractable DTs, paving the way for dependable models across
industrial and scientific energy systems.

Abstract: In the oil industry, undesirable events in oil wells can cause economic
losses, environmental accidents, and human casualties. Solutions based on
Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning for Early Detection of such events
have proven valuable for diverse applications across industries. In 2019,
recognizing the importance and the lack of public datasets related to
undesirable events in oil wells, Petrobras developed and publicly released the
first version of the 3W Dataset, which is essentially a set of Multivariate
Time Series labeled by experts. Since then, the 3W Dataset has been developed
collaboratively and has become a foundational reference for numerous works in
the field. This data article describes the current publicly available version
of the 3W Dataset, which contains structural modifications and additional
labeled data. The detailed description provided encourages and supports the 3W
community and new 3W users to improve previous published results and to develop
new robust methodologies, digital products and services capable of detecting
undesirable events in oil wells with enough anticipation to enable corrective
or mitigating actions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体上的毒性内容对环境和公共话语构成威胁，现有方法在去毒性能、语义保留和数据效率上存在不足。

Method: 两阶段训练框架：先在小规模高质量并行数据上进行监督微调，再利用未标注数据和奖励模型通过Group Relative Policy Optimization训练LLM。

Result: 实验表明，该方法有效平衡了去毒性能、语义保留和泛化能力，显著减少了对标注数据的依赖。

Conclusion: 该方法在去毒任务中表现优异，具有更好的泛化能力和数据效率。

Abstract: The widespread dissemination of toxic content on social media poses a serious
threat to both online environments and public discourse, highlighting the
urgent need for detoxification methods that effectively remove toxicity while
preserving the original semantics. However, existing approaches often struggle
to simultaneously achieve strong detoxification performance, semantic
preservation, and robustness to out-of-distribution data. Moreover, they
typically rely on costly, manually annotated parallel corpora while showing
poor data efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose a two-stage
training framework that jointly optimizes for data efficiency, semantic
preservation, and model generalization. We first perform supervised fine-tuning
on a small set of high-quality, filtered parallel data to establish a strong
initialization. Then, we leverage unlabeled toxic inputs and a custom-designed
reward model to train the LLM using Group Relative Policy Optimization.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively mitigates the
trade-offs faced by previous work, achieving state-of-the-art performance with
improved generalization and significantly reduced dependence on annotated data.

Result: 成功应用于电影帧的存储和序列检索，展示了在高维空间中的有效性。

Conclusion: 该模型为长序列任务提供了新思路，有望应用于自然语言处理、预测等领域。

Abstract: In this study we introduce a novel energy functional for long-sequence
memory, building upon the framework of dense Hopfield networks which achieves
exponential storage capacity through higher-order interactions. Building upon
earlier work on long-sequence Hopfield memory models, we propose a temporal
kernal $K(m, k)$ to incorporate temporal dependencies, enabling efficient
sequential retrieval of patterns over extended sequences. We demonstrate the
successful application of this technique for the storage and sequential
retrieval of movies frames which are well suited for this because of the high
dimensional vectors that make up each frame creating enough variation between
even sequential frames in the high dimensional space. The technique has
applications in modern transformer architectures, including efficient
long-sequence modeling, memory augmentation, improved attention with temporal
bias, and enhanced handling of long-term dependencies in time-series data. Our
model offers a promising approach to address the limitations of transformers in
long-context tasks, with potential implications for natural language
processing, forecasting, and beyond.

Result: 预训练显著加速收敛（最高4.2倍），提升准确性和表示质量，多模态性能随数据规模增长更优。

Conclusion: 为材料科学提供了一种无需结构输入、基于实验数据的通用模型路径。

Abstract: Recent advances in materials discovery have been driven by structure-based
models, particularly those using crystal graphs. While effective for
computational datasets, these models are impractical for real-world
applications where atomic structures are often unknown or difficult to obtain.
We propose a scalable multimodal framework that learns directly from elemental
composition and X-ray diffraction (XRD) -- two of the more available modalities
in experimental workflows without requiring crystal structure input. Our
architecture integrates modality-specific encoders with a cross-attention
fusion module and is trained on the 5-million-sample Alexandria dataset. We
present masked XRD modeling (MXM), and apply MXM and contrastive alignment as
self-supervised pretraining strategies. Pretraining yields faster convergence
(up to 4.2x speedup) and improves both accuracy and representation quality. We
further demonstrate that multimodal performance scales more favorably with
dataset size than unimodal baselines, with gains compounding at larger data
regimes. Our results establish a path toward structure-free, experimentally
grounded foundation models for materials science.

Conclusion: 需采取主动防洪措施（如改进排水系统和使用抗洪材料）以提高路面在易受灾区域的韧性。

Abstract: Flooding can damage pavement infrastructure significantly, causing both
immediate and long-term structural and functional issues. This research
investigates how flooding events affect pavement deterioration, specifically
focusing on measuring pavement roughness by the International Roughness Index
(IRI). To quantify these effects, we utilized 20 years of pavement condition
data from TxDOT's PMIS database, which is integrated with flood event data,
including duration and spatial extent. Statistical analyses were performed to
compare IRI values before and after flooding and to calculate the deterioration
rates influenced by flood exposure. Moreover, we applied Explainable Artificial
Intelligence (XAI) techniques, such as SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and
Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME), to assess the impact of
flooding on pavement performance. The results demonstrate that flood-affected
pavements experience a more rapid increase in roughness compared to non-flooded
sections. These findings emphasize the need for proactive flood mitigation
strategies, including improved drainage systems, flood-resistant materials, and
preventative maintenance, to enhance pavement resilience in vulnerable regions.

Result: 基础模型在预测突发性事件时表现优于随机模型，并能以小于6%的误差估计年度中断统计数据。

Conclusion: 基础模型在预测罕见、突发性事件中具有潜力，尤其在特定数据模式下的表现优于传统方法。

Abstract: Time series forecasting models have diverse real world applications (e.g.,
from electricity metrics to software workload). Latest foundational models
trained for time series forecasting show strengths (e.g., for long sequences
and in zero-shot settings). However, foundational model was not yet used for
forecasting rare, spiky events, i.e., a challenging target because those are a
corner case of extreme events. In this paper, we optimize a state-of-the-art
foundational model to forecast sporadic or spiky production outages of
high-performance machine learning services powering billions of client devices.
We evaluate the forecasting errors of the foundational model compared with
classical stochastic forecasting models (e.g., moving average and
autoregressive). The analysis helps us understand how each of the evaluated
models performs for the sporadic or spiky events. For example, it identifies
the key patterns in the target data that are well tracked by the foundational
model vs. each of the stochastic models. We use the models with optimal
parameters to estimate a year-long outage statistics of a particular root cause
with less than 6% value errors.

Abstract: This study leverages an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) dataset to develop
explainable AI methods for the early detection and prediction of Freezing of
Gait (FOG), a common symptom in Parkinson's disease. Machine learning models,
including CatBoost, XGBoost, and Extra Trees classifiers, are employed to

interpretability analysis reveals that time (seconds) is the most influential
factor in distinguishing gait patterns. Additionally, the proposed FOG
prediction framework incorporates federated learning, where models are trained
locally on individual devices and aggregated on a central server using a

Result: 在QM9和C10数据集上表现出更高的预测准确性、鲁棒性和泛化性。

Conclusion: 该方法为药物发现和材料设计中的3D分子信息处理提供了高效且有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success in molecular
property prediction. However, traditional graph representations struggle to
effectively encode the inherent 3D spatial structures of molecules, as
molecular orientations in 3D space introduce significant variability, severely
limiting model generalization and robustness. Existing approaches primarily
focus on rotation-invariant and rotation-equivariant methods. Invariant methods
often rely heavily on prior knowledge and lack sufficient generalizability,
while equivariant methods suffer from high computational costs. To address
these limitations, this paper proposes a novel plug-and-play 3D encoding module
leveraging rotational sampling. By computing the expectation over the SO(3)
rotational group, the method naturally achieves approximate rotational
invariance. Furthermore, by introducing a carefully designed post-alignment
strategy, strict invariance can be achieved without compromising performance.
Experimental evaluations on the QM9 and C10 Datasets demonstrate superior
predictive accuracy, robustness, and generalization performance compared to
existing methods. Moreover, the proposed approach maintains low computational
complexity and enhanced interpretability, providing a promising direction for
efficient and effective handling of 3D molecular information in drug discovery
and material design.

Abstract: As the demand for large scale AI models continues to grow, the optimization
of their training to balance computational efficiency, execution time, accuracy
and energy consumption represents a critical multidimensional challenge.
Achieving this balance requires not only innovative algorithmic techniques and
hardware architectures but also comprehensive tools for monitoring, analyzing,
and understanding the underlying processes involved in model training and
deployment. Provenance data information about the origins, context, and
transformations of data and processes has become a key component in this
pursuit. By leveraging provenance, researchers and engineers can gain insights
into resource usage patterns, identify inefficiencies, and ensure
reproducibility and accountability in AI development workflows. For this
reason, the question of how distributed resources can be optimally utilized to
scale large AI models in an energy efficient manner is a fundamental one. To
support this effort, we introduce the yProv4ML library, a tool designed to
collect provenance data in JSON format, compliant with the W3C PROV and ProvML
standards. yProv4ML focuses on flexibility and extensibility, and enables users
to integrate additional data collection tools via plugins. The library is fully
integrated with the yProv framework, allowing for higher level pairing in tasks
run also through workflow management systems.

Conclusion: 该方法通过生成能力减少了手动标注的高成本和错误率，提高了复杂通信环境中的检测准确性。

Abstract: Anomaly detection often relies on supervised or clustering approaches, with
limited success in specialized domains like automotive communication systems
where scalable solutions are essential. We propose a novel decoder-only Large
Language Model (LLM) to detect anomalies in Electronic Control Unit (ECU)
communication logs. Our approach addresses two key challenges: the lack of LLMs
tailored for ECU communication and the complexity of inconsistent ground truth
data. By learning from UDP communication logs, we formulate anomaly detection
simply as identifying deviations in time from normal behavior. We introduce an
entropy regularization technique that increases model's uncertainty in known
anomalies while maintaining consistency in similar scenarios. Our solution
offers three novelties: a decoder-only anomaly detection architecture, a way to
handle inconsistent labeling, and an adaptable LLM for different ECU
communication use cases. By leveraging the generative capabilities of
decoder-only models, we present a new technique that addresses the high cost
and error-prone nature of manual labeling through a more scalable system that
is able to learn from a minimal set of examples, while improving detection
accuracy in complex communication environments.

Abstract: The rapid growth of interest in large language models (LLMs) reflects their
potential for flexibility and generalization, and attracted the attention of a
diverse range of researchers. However, the advent of these techniques has also
brought to light the lack of transparency and rigor with which development is
pursued. In particular, the inability to determine the number of epochs and
other hyperparameters in advance presents challenges in identifying the best
model. To address this challenge, machine learning frameworks such as MLFlow
can automate the collection of this type of information. However, these tools
capture data using proprietary formats and pose little attention to lineage.
This paper proposes yProv4ML, a framework to capture provenance information
generated during machine learning processes in PROV-JSON format, with minimal
code modifications.

Motivation: 急诊分诊中的误诊问题（如分诊不足或过度）日益严重，AI的引入可能提升分诊效率和准确性。

Method: 回顾性分析7个月的急诊患者数据，训练并验证三种AI模型（NLP、LLM、JEPA），评估其与FRENCH标准的吻合度。

Conclusion: AI（尤其是LLM）可提升急诊分诊的准确性和效率，但需解决模型局限性和伦理问题。

Abstract: Triage errors, including undertriage and overtriage, are persistent
challenges in emergency departments (EDs). With increasing patient influx and
staff shortages, the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into triage
protocols has gained attention. This study compares the performance of three AI
models [Natural Language Processing (NLP), Large Language Models (LLM), and
Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA)] in predicting triage outcomes
against the FRENCH scale and clinical practice.We conducted a retrospective
analysis of a prospectively recruited cohort gathering adult patient triage
data over a 7-month period at the Roger Salengro Hospital ED (Lille, France).
Three AI models were trained and validated : (1) TRIAGEMASTER (NLP), (2)
URGENTIAPARSE (LLM), and (3) EMERGINET (JEPA). Data included demographic
details, verbatim chief complaints, vital signs, and triage outcomes based on
the FRENCH scale and GEMSA coding. The primary outcome was the concordance of
AI-predicted triage level with the FRENCH gold-standard. It was assessed thanks
to various indicators : F1-Score, Weighted Kappa, Spearman, MAE, RMSE. The LLM
model (URGENTIAPARSE) showed higher accuracy (composite score: 2.514) compared
to JEPA (EMERGINET, 0.438) and NLP (TRIAGEMASTER, -3.511), outperforming nurse
triage (-4.343). Secondary analyses highlighted the effectiveness of
URGENTIAPARSE in predicting hospitalization needs (GEMSA) and its robustness
with structured data versus raw transcripts (either for GEMSA prediction or for
FRENCH prediction). LLM architecture, through abstraction of patient
representations, offers the most accurate triage predictions among tested
models. Integrating AI into ED workflows could enhance patient safety and
operational efficiency, though integration into clinical workflows requires
addressing model limitations and ensuring ethical transparency.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文详细解释了Ziyin等人（2025）关于嵌入式深度线性网络模型（EDLN）的“完美”柏拉图表示假设（PRH）的证明。研究表明，使用SGD训练时，不同宽度和深度的EDLN在不同数据上会达到完美柏拉图状态，即每对层学习相同的表示（仅旋转不同）。由于损失函数的全局极小值大多非柏拉图，这一现象尤为特殊。此外，研究还揭示了PRH可能被打破的六种方式，并指出柏拉图表示与渐进锐化现象有共同成因。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨SGD训练下EDLN模型如何形成完美柏拉图表示，并揭示其与渐进锐化现象的潜在联系，以理解SGD不可逆性导致的“熵力”在表示学习中的作用。

Method: 通过详细分析Ziyin等人的证明，探讨EDLN模型在SGD训练下的行为，特别是不同宽度和深度的网络如何收敛到完美柏拉图表示。

Result: 研究发现SGD仅找到完美柏拉图解，且揭示了PRH可能被打破的六种方式。此外，柏拉图表示与渐进锐化现象有共同成因。

Conclusion: 研究强调了理解SGD训练中“熵力”的重要性，为表示学习提供了新视角，同时避免了冗长的技术细节。

Abstract: In this note, we elaborate on and explain in detail the proof given by Ziyin
et al. (2025) of the "perfect" Platonic Representation Hypothesis (PRH) for the
embedded deep linear network model (EDLN). We show that if trained with SGD,
two EDLNs with different widths and depths and trained on different data will
become Perfectly Platonic, meaning that every possible pair of layers will
learn the same representation up to a rotation. Because most of the global
minima of the loss function are not Platonic, that SGD only finds the perfectly
Platonic solution is rather extraordinary. The proof also suggests at least six
ways the PRH can be broken. We also show that in the EDLN model, the emergence
of the Platonic representations is due to the same reason as the emergence of
progressive sharpening. This implies that these two seemingly unrelated
phenomena in deep learning can, surprisingly, have a common cause. Overall, the
theory and proof highlight the importance of understanding emergent "entropic
forces" due to the irreversibility of SGD training and their role in
representation learning. The goal of this note is to be instructive and avoid
lengthy technical details.

Abstract: The scientific computation methods development in conjunction with artificial
intelligence technologies remains a hot research topic. Finding a balance
between lightweight and accurate computations is a solid foundation for this
direction. The study presents a neural operator based on the dynamic mode
decomposition algorithm (DMD), mapping functional spaces, which combines DMD
and deep learning (DL) for spatiotemporal processes efficient modeling. Solving
PDEs for various initial and boundary conditions requires significant
computational resources. The method suggested automatically extracts key modes
and system dynamics using them to construct predictions, reducing computational
costs compared to traditional numerical methods. The approach has demonstrated
its efficiency through comparative analysis of performance with closest
analogues DeepONet and FNO in the heat equation, Laplaces equation, and Burgers
equation solutions approximation, where it achieves high reconstruction
accuracy.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文分析了差分隐私训练中球形噪声对自适应优化器的影响，提出了一种名为scale-then-privatize的简单技术，并证明其优于其他方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 球形噪声在差分隐私训练中降低了自适应优化器的性能，现有研究结论可能无法推广到实际模型训练中。

Method: 调查了多种改进算法，进行了理论分析和实证研究，重点比较了scale-then-privatize技术。

Result: scale-then-privatize在理论上有更优行为，并在小规模语言模型训练任务中表现最佳。

Conclusion: scale-then-privatize技术更匹配实际应用中的相关噪声机制，优于其他方法。

Abstract: The spherical noise added to gradients in differentially private (DP)
training undermines the performance of adaptive optimizers like AdaGrad and
Adam, and hence many recent works have proposed algorithms to address this
challenge. However, the empirical results in these works focus on simple tasks
and models and the conclusions may not generalize to model training in
practice. In this paper we survey several of these variants, and develop better
theoretical intuition for them as well as perform empirical studies comparing
them. We find that a common intuition of aiming for unbiased estimates of
second moments of gradients in adaptive optimizers is misguided, and instead
that a simple technique called scale-then-privatize (which does not achieve
unbiased second moments) has more desirable theoretical behaviors and
outperforms all other variants we study on a small-scale language model
training task. We additionally argue that scale-then-privatize causes the noise
addition to better match the application of correlated noise mechanisms which
are more desirable to use in practice.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种近似等变的张量分解网络（TDNs），通过低秩张量分解（如CP分解）替代计算昂贵的Clebsch-Gordan（CG）张量积，显著加速计算，同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的SO(3)-等变网络在机器学习原子间势（MLIPs）中占主导地位，但其关键操作CG张量积计算成本高，亟需优化。

Method: 提出TDNs，采用CP分解替代CG张量积，并引入路径权重共享进一步减少参数。理论证明了其近似等变性和通用性。

Result: 在PubChemQCR、OC20和OC22数据集上，TDNs在保持性能的同时显著加速计算（复杂度从O(L^6)降至O(L^4)）。

Conclusion: TDNs是一种高效且性能优异的替代方案，适用于现有网络中的张量积操作。

Abstract: $\rm{SO}(3)$-equivariant networks are the dominant models for machine
learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs). The key operation of such networks is
the Clebsch-Gordan (CG) tensor product, which is computationally expensive. To
accelerate the computation, we develop tensor decomposition networks (TDNs) as
a class of approximately equivariant networks whose CG tensor products are
replaced by low-rank tensor decompositions, such as the CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP)
decomposition. With the CP decomposition, we prove (i) a uniform bound on the
induced error of $\rm{SO}(3)$-equivariance, and (ii) the universality of
approximating any equivariant bilinear map. To further reduce the number of
parameters, we propose path-weight sharing that ties all multiplicity-space
weights across the $O(L^3)$ CG paths into a single path without compromising
equivariance, where $L$ is the maximum angular degree. The resulting layer acts
as a plug-and-play replacement for tensor products in existing networks, and
the computational complexity of tensor products is reduced from $O(L^6)$ to
$O(L^4)$. We evaluate TDNs on PubChemQCR, a newly curated molecular relaxation
dataset containing 105 million DFT-calculated snapshots. We also use existing
datasets, including OC20, and OC22. Results show that TDNs achieve competitive
performance with dramatic speedup in computations.

*Brenda Nogueira,Gabe Gomes,Meng Jiang,Nitesh V. Chawla,Nuno Moniz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Spectral Manifold Harmonization（SMH）的新方法，用于解决图结构数据中的不平衡回归问题，通过生成合成样本以关注代表性不足的目标区域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图结构数据在科学领域中普遍存在，但现有研究对不平衡回归问题关注不足，尤其是针对特定目标值范围的情况。

Method: SMH方法通过生成合成图样本，保留拓扑特性并聚焦于目标分布中代表性不足的区域。

Result: 实验结果表明，SMH在化学和药物发现基准数据集上显著提升了目标域范围的预测性能。

Conclusion: SMH为解决图结构数据中的不平衡回归问题提供了一种有效方法，尤其在关注特定目标范围时表现优异。

Abstract: Graph-structured data is ubiquitous in scientific domains, where models often
face imbalanced learning settings. In imbalanced regression, domain preferences
focus on specific target value ranges representing the most scientifically
valuable cases; we observe a significant lack of research. In this paper, we
present Spectral Manifold Harmonization (SMH), a novel approach for addressing
this imbalanced regression challenge on graph-structured data by generating
synthetic graph samples that preserve topological properties while focusing on
often underrepresented target distribution regions. Conventional methods fail
in this context because they either ignore graph topology in case generation or
do not target specific domain ranges, resulting in models biased toward average
target values. Experimental results demonstrate the potential of SMH on
chemistry and drug discovery benchmark datasets, showing consistent
improvements in predictive performance for target domain ranges.

### [152] [FlashDP: Private Training Large Language Models with Efficient DP-SGD](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01154)
*Liangyu Wang,Junxiao Wang,Jie Ren,Zihang Xiang,David E. Keyes,Di Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FlashDP是一种高效的差分隐私训练方法，通过单次梯度计算和缓存优化，显著减少内存和计算开销，同时保持准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型（LLMs）的广泛应用，训练数据的隐私保护成为关键问题。现有差分隐私方法（如DP-SGD）存在内存和计算效率低下的问题。

Method: FlashDP提出了一种缓存友好的逐层DP-SGD方法，通过融合操作和单次梯度计算，减少内存移动和冗余计算。

Result: FlashDP在Llama-13B模型预训练中，内存需求不增加，计算效率提升（减少50%内存移动和20%冗余计算），且准确性与标准方法相当。

Conclusion: FlashDP为高效且隐私保护的LLMs训练提供了重要进展，其代码已开源。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) increasingly underpin technological
advancements, the privacy of their training data emerges as a critical concern.
Differential Privacy (DP) serves as a rigorous mechanism to protect this data,
yet its integration via Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent
(DP-SGD) introduces substantial challenges, primarily due to the complexities
of per-sample gradient clipping. Current explicit methods, such as Opacus,
necessitate extensive storage for per-sample gradients, significantly inflating
memory requirements. Conversely, implicit methods like GhostClip reduce storage
needs by recalculating gradients multiple times, which leads to inefficiencies
due to redundant computations. This paper introduces FlashDP, an innovative
cache-friendly per-layer DP-SGD that consolidates necessary operations into a
single task, calculating gradients only once in a fused manner. This approach
not only diminishes memory movement by up to \textbf{50\%} but also cuts down
redundant computations by \textbf{20\%}, compared to previous methods.
Consequently, FlashDP does not increase memory demands and achieves a
\textbf{90\%} throughput compared to the Non-DP method on a four-A100 system
during the pre-training of the Llama-13B model, while maintaining parity with
standard per-layer clipped DP-SGD in terms of accuracy. These advancements
establish FlashDP as a pivotal development for efficient and privacy-preserving
training of LLMs. FlashDP's code has been open-sourced in
https://github.com/kaustpradalab/flashdp.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有资源要么需要高级理论基础，要么过于关注神经网络架构，而忽略了扩散模型的几何特性。

Method: 开发了一个交互式工具Diffusion Explorer，用户可以在浏览器中训练2D扩散模型并观察采样过程的时间动态。

Result: 通过交互式动画直观展示了扩散模型的几何特性和时间演化过程。

Conclusion: Diffusion Explorer为理解和教学扩散模型的几何特性提供了直观且易于访问的工具。

Abstract: Diffusion models have been central to the development of recent image, video,
and even text generation systems. They posses striking geometric properties
that can be faithfully portrayed in low-dimensional settings. However, existing
resources for explaining diffusion either require an advanced theoretical
foundation or focus on their neural network architectures rather than their
rich geometric properties. We introduce Diffusion Explorer, an interactive tool
to explain the geometric properties of diffusion models. Users can train 2D
diffusion models in the browser and observe the temporal dynamics of their
sampling process. Diffusion Explorer leverages interactive animation, which has
been shown to be a powerful tool for making engaging visualizations of dynamic
systems, making it well suited to explaining diffusion models which represent
stochastic processes that evolve over time. Diffusion Explorer is open source
and a live demo is available at alechelbling.com/Diffusion-Explorer.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文评估了大型脑波基础模型（LBMs）在脑机接口（BCI）任务中的表现，发现其性能提升有限但参数需求高，通过LoRA技术显著减少参数，揭示了当前模型的效率问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨基础模型在脑波建模中的潜力，评估其在BCI任务中的实际效果。

Method: 通过系统微调实验和LoRA技术，对比LBMs与传统架构在多项BCI任务（如记忆任务和睡眠阶段分类）中的表现。

Result: LBMs仅比传统架构提升0.9%-1.2%，但参数需求高；LoRA显著减少参数且不降低性能。

Conclusion: 当前LBMs在脑波分析中效率不足，需领域特定优化和架构改进。

Abstract: Foundation Models have demonstrated significant success across various
domains in Artificial Intelligence (AI), yet their capabilities for brainwave
modeling remain unclear. In this paper, we comprehensively evaluate current
Large Brainwave Foundation Models (LBMs) through systematic fine-tuning
experiments across multiple Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) benchmark tasks,
including memory tasks and sleep stage classification. Our extensive analysis
shows that state-of-the-art LBMs achieve only marginal improvements (0.9%-1.2%)
over traditional deep architectures while requiring significantly more
parameters (millions vs thousands), raising important questions about their
efficiency and applicability in BCI contexts. Moreover, through detailed
ablation studies and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), we significantly reduce
trainable parameters without performance degradation, while demonstrating that
architectural and training inefficiencies limit LBMs' current capabilities. Our
experiments span both full model fine-tuning and parameter-efficient adaptation
techniques, providing insights into optimal training strategies for BCI
applications. We pioneer the application of LoRA to LBMs, revealing that
performance benefits generally emerge when adapting multiple neural network
components simultaneously. These findings highlight the critical need for
domain-specific development strategies to advance LBMs, suggesting that current
architectures may require redesign to fully leverage the potential of
foundation models in brainwave analysis.

*Hyoseo,Yoon,Yisong Yue,Been Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为JAM的框架，通过联合训练模态特定的自编码器，优化预训练单模态模型的潜在表示，以实现视觉和语言模型的跨模态对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探索视觉和语言模型是否可以通过优化实现共享的统计模型，而不仅仅是事后检测对齐。

Method: 方法是通过JAM框架，结合重建和跨模态目标，对预训练模型的潜在表示进行联合训练。

Result: 结果表明，JAM框架能够有效诱导对齐，即使是在冻结的独立训练表示上。

Conclusion: 结论是JAM框架为将通用单模态模型转化为专用多模态模型提供了理论和实践路径。

Abstract: Independently trained vision and language models inhabit disjoint
representational spaces, shaped by their respective modalities, objectives, and
architectures. Yet an emerging hypothesis - the Platonic Representation
Hypothesis - suggests that such models may nonetheless converge toward a shared
statistical model of reality. This compatibility, if it exists, raises a
fundamental question: can we move beyond post-hoc statistical detection of
alignment and explicitly optimize for it between such disjoint representations?
We cast this Platonic alignment problem as a multi-objective optimization task
- preserve each modality's native structure while aligning for mutual
coherence. We introduce the Joint Autoencoder Modulator (JAM) framework that
jointly trains modality-specific autoencoders on the latent representations of
pre-trained single modality models, encouraging alignment through both
reconstruction and cross-modal objectives. By analogy, this framework serves as
a method to escape Plato's Cave, enabling the emergence of shared structure
from disjoint inputs. We evaluate this framework across three critical design
axes: (i) the alignment objective - comparing contrastive loss (Con), its
hard-negative variant (NegCon), and our Spread loss, (ii) the layer depth at
which alignment is most effective, and (iii) the impact of foundation model
scale on representational convergence. Our findings show that our lightweight
Pareto-efficient framework reliably induces alignment, even across frozen,
independently trained representations, offering both theoretical insight and
practical pathways for transforming generalist unimodal foundations into
specialist multimodal models.

Abstract: Modern vehicles are increasingly connected, and in this context, automotive
Ethernet is one of the technologies that promise to provide the necessary
infrastructure for intra-vehicle communication. However, these systems are
subject to attacks that can compromise safety, including flow injection
attacks. Deep Learning-based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are often
designed to combat this problem, but they require expensive hardware to run in
real time. In this work, we propose to evaluate and apply fast neural network
inference techniques like Distilling and Prunning for deploying IDS models on
low-cost platforms in real time. The results show that these techniques can
achieve intrusion detection times of up to 727 {\mu}s using a Raspberry Pi 4,
with AUCROC values of 0.9890.

Motivation: 解决移动设备资源有限与服务器辅助方法通信负担重、隐私泄露的问题。

Result: 减少了通信成本，加速了微调收敛，提高了计算效率，同时保护了数据隐私。

Conclusion: PAE MobiLLM在移动设备上实现了高效且隐私保护的LLM微调。

Abstract: There is a huge gap between numerous intriguing applications fostered by
on-device large language model (LLM) fine-tuning (FT) from fresh mobile data
and the limited resources of a mobile device. While existing server-assisted
methods (e.g., split learning or side-tuning) may enable LLM FT on the local
mobile device, they suffer from heavy communication burdens of activation
transmissions, and may disclose data, labels or fine-tuned models to the
server. To address those issues, we develop PAE MobiLLM, a privacy-aware and
efficient LLM FT method which can be deployed on the mobile device via
server-assisted additive side-tuning. To further accelerate FT convergence and
improve computing efficiency, PAE MobiLLM integrates activation caching on the
server side, which allows the server to reuse historical activations and saves
the mobile device from repeatedly computing forward passes for the recurring
data samples. Besides, to reduce communication cost, PAE MobiLLM develops a
one-token (i.e., ``pivot'' token) activation shortcut that transmits only a
single activation dimension instead of full activation matrices to guide the
side network tuning. Last but not least, PAE MobiLLM introduces the additive
adapter side-network design which makes the server train the adapter modules
based on device-defined prediction differences rather than raw ground-truth
labels. In this way, the server can only assist device-defined side-network
computing, and learn nothing about data, labels or fine-tuned models.

Conclusion: QNN在分类任务中表现更优，为量子机器学习在智能交通系统中的应用提供了潜力。

Abstract: Quantum computing has opened new opportunities to tackle complex machine
learning tasks, for instance, high-dimensional data representations commonly
required in intelligent transportation systems. We explore quantum machine
learning to model complex skin conductance response (SCR) events that reflect
pedestrian stress in a virtual reality road crossing experiment. For this
purpose, Quantum Support Vector Machine (QSVM) with an eight-qubit ZZ feature
map and a Quantum Neural Network (QNN) using a Tree Tensor Network ansatz and
an eight-qubit ZZ feature map, were developed on Pennylane. The dataset
consists of SCR measurements along with features such as the response amplitude
and elapsed time, which have been categorized into amplitude-based classes. The
QSVM achieved good training accuracy, but had an overfitting problem, showing a
low test accuracy of 45% and therefore impacting the reliability of the
classification model. The QNN model reached a higher test accuracy of 55%,
making it a better classification model than the QSVM and the classic versions.

Motivation: 传统随机梯度下降（SGD）在大规模应用中存在性能限制，本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出随机共轭次梯度方法，结合自适应采样和AdamW类算法调整步长，以应对LLM训练中的非凸性和非光滑性。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在速度和准确性上均优于传统SGD，且具有更好的可扩展性。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了SGD在大规模LLM训练中的局限性，显著提升了优化效率。

Abstract: Stochastic gradient-based descent (SGD), have long been central to training
large language models (LLMs). However, their effectiveness is increasingly
being questioned, particularly in large-scale applications where empirical
evidence suggests potential performance limitations. In response, this paper
proposes a stochastic conjugate subgradient method together with adaptive
sampling tailored specifically for training LLMs. The method not only achieves
faster convergence per iteration but also demonstrates improved scalability
compared to traditional SGD techniques. It leverages sample complexity analysis
to adaptively choose the sample size, employs a stochastic conjugate
subgradient approach to determine search directions and utilizing an AdamW-like
algorithm to adaptively adjust step sizes. This approach preserves the key
advantages of first-order methods while effectively addressing the nonconvexity
and non-smoothness inherent in LLMs training. Additionally, we provide a
detailed analysis of the advantage of the algorithm. Experimental results show
that the proposed method not only maintains, but in many cases surpasses, the
scalability of traditional SGD techniques, significantly enhancing both the
speed and accuracy of the optimization process.

Result: 现有技术能成功遗忘微调知识，但难以消除预训练信息；单次批量遗忘方法在多次操作中性能显著下降。

Conclusion: PULSE协议揭示了现有遗忘方法的局限性，为未来研究提供了更全面的评估方向。

Abstract: In recent years, unlearning techniques, which are methods for inducing a
model to "forget" previously learned information, have attracted attention as a
way to address privacy and copyright concerns in large language models (LLMs)
and large multimodal models (LMMs). While several unlearning benchmarks have
been established for LLMs, a practical evaluation framework for unlearning in
LMMs has been less explored. Specifically, existing unlearning benchmark for
LMMs considers only scenarios in which the model is required to unlearn
fine-tuned knowledge through a single unlearning operation. In this study, we
introduce PULSE protocol for realistic unlearning scenarios for LMMs by
introducing two critical perspectives: (i) Pre-trained knowledge Unlearning for
analyzing the effect across different knowledge acquisition phases and (ii)
Long-term Sustainability Evaluation to address sequential requests. We then
evaluate existing unlearning methods along these dimensions. Our results reveal
that, although some techniques can successfully unlearn knowledge acquired
through fine-tuning, they struggle to eliminate information learned during
pre-training. Moreover, methods that effectively unlearn a batch of target data
in a single operation exhibit substantial performance degradation when the same
data are split and unlearned sequentially.

Motivation: 传统联邦学习聚合方法未考虑用户嵌入的独特性和用户相似性对推荐效果的影响，且缺乏对高相关性锚用户的适应性保护。

Method: 提出Dist-FedAvg方法，通过基于距离的权重分配增强用户相似性，同时保留锚用户在本地更新中的影响力。

Result: 在多数据集上的实验表明，Dist-FedAvg在推荐准确性上优于基线方法，且易于集成到现有联邦学习框架中。

Conclusion: Dist-FedAvg有效解决了传统聚合方法的局限性，提升了图联邦推荐系统的性能。

Abstract: Graph federated recommendation systems offer a privacy-preserving alternative
to traditional centralized recommendation architectures, which often raise
concerns about data security. While federated learning enables personalized
recommendations without exposing raw user data, existing aggregation methods
overlook the unique properties of user embeddings in this setting. Indeed,
traditional aggregation methods fail to account for their complexity and the
critical role of user similarity in recommendation effectiveness. Moreover,
evolving user interactions require adaptive aggregation while preserving the
influence of high-relevance anchor users (the primary users before expansion in
graph-based frameworks). To address these limitations, we introduce
Dist-FedAvg, a novel distance-based aggregation method designed to enhance
personalization and aggregation efficiency in graph federated learning. Our
method assigns higher aggregation weights to users with similar embeddings,
while ensuring that anchor users retain significant influence in local updates.
Empirical evaluations on multiple datasets demonstrate that Dist-FedAvg
consistently outperforms baseline aggregation techniques, improving
recommendation accuracy while maintaining seamless integration into existing
federated learning frameworks.

Motivation: 高维随机控制问题因维度灾难难以解决，传统动态规划方法效率低，需要替代方案。

Result: 证明了NHO在一般鞅驱动下的通用逼近能力，并分析了优化挑战。

Conclusion: NHO为高维随机控制问题提供了有效的深度学习解决方案，并具有理论保证。

Abstract: Stochastic control problems in high dimensions are notoriously difficult to
solve due to the curse of dimensionality. An alternative to traditional dynamic
programming is Pontryagin's Maximum Principle (PMP), which recasts the problem
as a system of Forward-Backward Stochastic Differential Equations (FBSDEs). In
this paper, we introduce a formal framework for solving such problems with deep
learning by defining a \textbf{Neural Hamiltonian Operator (NHO)}. This
operator parameterizes the coupled FBSDE dynamics via neural networks that
represent the feedback control and an ansatz for the value function's spatial
gradient. We show how the optimal NHO can be found by training the underlying
networks to enforce the consistency conditions dictated by the PMP. By adopting
this operator-theoretic view, we situate the deep FBSDE method within the
rigorous language of statistical inference, framing it as a problem of learning
an unknown operator from simulated data. This perspective allows us to prove
the universal approximation capabilities of NHOs under general martingale
drivers and provides a clear lens for analyzing the significant optimization
challenges inherent to this class of models.

However, it also introduces a critical vulnerability to backdoor attacks, where
adversaries can manipulate LLM behaviors by simply poisoning a few ICL
demonstrations. In this paper, we propose, for the first time, the
dual-learning hypothesis, which posits that LLMs simultaneously learn both the
task-relevant latent concepts and backdoor latent concepts within poisoned
demonstrations, jointly influencing the probability of model outputs. Through
theoretical analysis, we derive an upper bound for ICL backdoor effects,
revealing that the vulnerability is dominated by the concept preference ratio
between the task and the backdoor. Motivated by these findings, we propose
ICLShield, a defense mechanism that dynamically adjusts the concept preference
ratio. Our method encourages LLMs to select clean demonstrations during the ICL
phase by leveraging confidence and similarity scores, effectively mitigating
susceptibility to backdoor attacks. Extensive experiments across multiple LLMs
and tasks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art defense
effectiveness, significantly outperforming existing approaches (+26.02% on
average). Furthermore, our method exhibits exceptional adaptability and
defensive performance even for closed-source models (e.g., GPT-4).

Abstract: Detecting abnormal events in real-world customer service dialogues is highly
challenging due to the complexity of business data and the dynamic nature of
customer interactions. Moreover, models must demonstrate strong out-of-domain
(OOD) generalization to enable rapid adaptation across different business
scenarios and maximize commercial value. In this work, we propose a novel
Adaptive Perplexity-Aware Reinforcement Learning (APARL) framework that
leverages the advanced reasoning capabilities of large language models for
abnormal event detection. APARL introduces a dual-loop dynamic curriculum
learning architecture, enabling the model to progressively focus on more
challenging samples as its proficiency increases. This design effectively
addresses performance bottlenecks and significantly enhances OOD
transferability. Extensive evaluations on food delivery dialogue tasks show
that our model achieves significantly enhanced adaptability and robustness,
attaining the highest F1 score with an average improvement of 17.19\%, and an
average improvement of 9.59\% in OOD transfer tests. This method provides a
superior solution for industrial deployment of anomaly detection models,
contributing to improved operational efficiency and commercial benefits.

Motivation: 现有全球降水数据（如IMERG）分辨率较低（10公里），无法满足水文建模和极端天气分析的需求。

Method: WDM是一种条件扩散模型，直接在小波域中学习降水数据的复杂结构，通过关注高频小波系数生成高分辨率降水场。

Abstract: Effective hydrological modeling and extreme weather analysis demand
precipitation data at a kilometer-scale resolution, which is significantly
finer than the 10 km scale offered by standard global products like IMERG. To
address this, we propose the Wavelet Diffusion Model (WDM), a generative
framework that achieves 10x spatial super-resolution (downscaling to 1 km) and
delivers a 9x inference speedup over pixel-based diffusion models. WDM is a
conditional diffusion model that learns the learns the complex structure of
precipitation from MRMS radar data directly in the wavelet domain. By focusing
on high-frequency wavelet coefficients, it generates exceptionally realistic
and detailed 1-km precipitation fields. This wavelet-based approach produces
visually superior results with fewer artifacts than pixel-space models, and
delivers a significant gains in sampling efficiency. Our results demonstrate
that WDM provides a robust solution to the dual challenges of accuracy and
speed in geoscience super-resolution, paving the way for more reliable
hydrological forecasts.

Conclusion: DSAC-D算法在多模态策略学习和值函数估计方面具有显著优势，适用于复杂控制任务。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has been proven to be highly effective in handling
complex control tasks. Traditional methods typically use unimodal
distributions, such as Gaussian distributions, to model the output of value
distributions. However, unimodal distribution often and easily causes bias in
value function estimation, leading to poor algorithm performance. This paper
proposes a distributional reinforcement learning algorithm called DSAC-D
(Distributed Soft Actor Critic with Diffusion Policy) to address the challenges
of estimating bias in value functions and obtaining multimodal policy
representations. A multimodal distributional policy iteration framework that
can converge to the optimal policy was established by introducing policy
entropy and value distribution function. A diffusion value network that can
accurately characterize the distribution of multi peaks was constructed by
generating a set of reward samples through reverse sampling using a diffusion
model. Based on this, a distributional reinforcement learning algorithm with
dual diffusion of the value network and the policy network was derived. MuJoCo
testing tasks demonstrate that the proposed algorithm not only learns
multimodal policy, but also achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in all
9 control tasks, with significant suppression of estimation bias and total
average return improvement of over 10\% compared to existing mainstream
algorithms. The results of real vehicle testing show that DSAC-D can accurately
characterize the multimodal distribution of different driving styles, and the
diffusion policy network can characterize multimodal trajectories.

Abstract: Recently, a surrogate model was proposed that employs a factorization machine
to approximate the underlying input-output mapping of the original system, with
quantum annealing used to optimize the resulting surrogate function. Inspired
by this approach, we propose an enhanced surrogate model that incorporates
additional slack variables into both the factorization machine and its
associated Ising representation thereby unifying what was by design a two-step
process into a single, integrated step. During the training phase, the slack
variables are iteratively updated, enabling the model to account for
higher-order feature interactions. We apply the proposed method to the task of
predicting drug combination effects. Experimental results indicate that the
introduction of slack variables leads to a notable improvement of performance.
Our algorithm offers a promising approach for building efficient surrogate
models that exploit potential quantum advantages.

Conclusion: Transformer模型在复杂任务中表现出多机制特性，且这些机制的学习动态存在显著差异。

Abstract: We introduce a new family of toy problems that combine features of
linear-regression-style continuous in-context learning (ICL) with discrete
associative recall. We pretrain transformer models on sample traces from this
toy, specifically symbolically-labeled interleaved state observations from
randomly drawn linear deterministic dynamical systems. We study if the
transformer models can recall the state of a sequence previously seen in its
context when prompted to do so with the corresponding in-context label. Taking
a closer look at this task, it becomes clear that the model must perform two
functions: (1) identify which system's state should be recalled and apply that
system to its last seen state, and (2) continuing to apply the correct system
to predict the subsequent states. Training dynamics reveal that the first
capability emerges well into a model's training. Surprisingly, the second
capability, of continuing the prediction of a resumed sequence, develops much
earlier.
  Via out-of-distribution experiments, and a mechanistic analysis on model
weights via edge pruning, we find that next-token prediction for this toy
problem involves at least two separate mechanisms. One mechanism uses the
discrete symbolic labels to do the associative recall required to predict the
start of a resumption of a previously seen sequence. The second mechanism,
which is largely agnostic to the discrete symbolic labels, performs a
"Bayesian-style" prediction based on the previous token and the context. These
two mechanisms have different learning dynamics.
  To confirm that this multi-mechanism (manifesting as separate phase
transitions) phenomenon is not just an artifact of our toy setting, we used
OLMo training checkpoints on an ICL translation task to see a similar
phenomenon: a decisive gap in the emergence of first-task-token performance vs
second-task-token performance.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于TVM编译器的工作流，用于高效地将AI工作负载映射到RISC-V向量单元，相比现有方法显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RISC-V的向量扩展（RVV）在AI工作负载加速中具有潜力，但缺乏智能化的自动调优框架，限制了其高效部署。

Method: 将RVV扩展集成到TVM的MetaSchedule框架中，利用概率程序框架对张量操作进行调优，并在FPGA上实现不同RISC-V SoC进行验证。

Result: 相比GCC的自动向量化功能，执行延迟平均提升46%，比muRISCV-NN快29%，且代码内存占用更小。在商用RISC-V SoC上，比LLVM快35%。

Conclusion: 提出的方法显著提升了RISC-V向量单元的效率，适用于嵌入式设备，并开源以支持社区扩展。

Abstract: RISC-V provides a flexible and scalable platform for applications ranging
from embedded devices to high-performance computing clusters. Particularly, its
RISC-V Vector Extension (RVV) becomes of interest for the acceleration of AI
workloads. But writing software that efficiently utilizes the vector units of
RISC-V CPUs without expert knowledge requires the programmer to rely on the
autovectorization features of compilers or hand-crafted libraries like
muRISCV-NN. Smarter approaches, like autotuning frameworks, have been missing
the integration with the RISC-V RVV extension, thus heavily limiting the
efficient deployment of complex AI workloads. In this paper, we present a
workflow based on the TVM compiler to efficiently map AI workloads onto RISC-V
vector units. Instead of relying on hand-crafted libraries, we integrated the
RVV extension into TVM's MetaSchedule framework, a probabilistic program
framework for tensor operation tuning. We implemented different RISC-V SoCs on
an FPGA and tuned a wide range of AI workloads on them. We found that our
proposal shows a mean improvement of 46% in execution latency when compared
against the autovectorization feature of GCC, and 29% against muRISCV-NN.
Moreover, the binary resulting from our proposal has a smaller code memory
footprint, making it more suitable for embedded devices. Finally, we also
evaluated our solution on a commercially available RISC-V SoC implementing the
RVV 1.0 Vector Extension and found our solution is able to find mappings that
are 35% faster on average than the ones proposed by LLVM. We open-sourced our
proposal for the community to expand it to target other RISC-V extensions.

Motivation: 文化遗址中IPS的实施面临环境限制、技术难题和数据缺乏等挑战，特别是缺乏反映博物馆环境的公开RSS数据集。

Method: 通过Android和iOS平台在13个博物馆房间的90件艺术品前收集RSS数据，并采用邻近性方法和k-NN算法建立分类基线。

Result: 提供了BAR数据集，并展示了基于邻近性和k-NN算法的分类结果。

Conclusion: BAR数据集填补了博物馆环境RSS数据的空白，为未来IPS研究提供了基础，并提出了进一步研究方向。

Abstract: Indoor Positioning Systems (IPSs) hold significant potential for enhancing
visitor experiences in cultural heritage institutions. By enabling personalized
navigation, efficient artifact organization, and better interaction with
exhibits, IPSs can transform the modalities of how individuals engage with
museums, galleries and libraries. However, these institutions face several
challenges in implementing IPSs, including environmental constraints, technical
limits, and limited experimentation. In other contexts, Received Signal
Strength (RSS)-based approaches using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and WiFi have
emerged as preferred solutions due to their non-invasive nature and minimal
infrastructure requirements. Nevertheless, the lack of publicly available RSS
datasets that specifically reflect museum environments presents a substantial
barrier to developing and evaluating positioning algorithms designed for the
intricate spatial characteristics typical of cultural heritage sites. To
address this limitation, we present BAR, a novel RSS dataset collected in front
of 90 artworks across 13 museum rooms using two different platforms, i.e.,
Android and iOS. Additionally, we provide an advanced position classification
baseline taking advantage of a proximity-based method and $k$-NN algorithms. In
our analysis, we discuss the results and offer suggestions for potential
research directions.

Result: 现有深度子目标算法无法有效利用零激励动态，性能受时间邻近性影响显著。

Conclusion: 当前方法存在根本局限，需开发不依赖即时奖励的潜在任务结构推断机制。

Abstract: This work re-examines the commonly held assumption that the frequency of
rewards is a reliable measure of task difficulty in reinforcement learning. We
identify and formalize a structural challenge that undermines the effectiveness
of current policy learning methods: when essential subgoals do not directly
yield rewards. We characterize such settings as exhibiting zero-incentive
dynamics, where transitions critical to success remain unrewarded. We show that
state-of-the-art deep subgoal-based algorithms fail to leverage these dynamics
and that learning performance is highly sensitive to the temporal proximity
between subgoal completion and eventual reward. These findings reveal a
fundamental limitation in current approaches and point to the need for
mechanisms that can infer latent task structure without relying on immediate
incentives.

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as powerful generative models, inspiring
extensive research into their underlying mechanisms. One of the key questions
in this area is the loss functions these models shall train with. Multiple
formulations have been introduced in the literature over the past several years
with some links and some critical differences stemming from various initial
considerations. In this paper, we explore the different target objectives and
corresponding loss functions in detail. We present a systematic overview of
their relationships, unifying them under the framework of the variational lower
bound objective. We complement this theoretical analysis with an empirical
study providing insights into the conditions under which these objectives
diverge in performance and the underlying factors contributing to such
deviations. Additionally, we evaluate how the choice of objective impacts the
model ability to achieve specific goals, such as generating high-quality
samples or accurately estimating likelihoods. This study offers a unified
understanding of loss functions in diffusion models, contributing to more
efficient and goal-oriented model designs in future research.

Abstract: Scientific applications of machine learning often rely on small, specialized

transforms latent embedding spaces into visual representations and then
leverages the spatial and fine-grained reasoning skills of VLMs to successfully

audio, biological, and tabular domains using a single 3B parameter model,
achieving results that beat Gemini by 16\% on average and approach specialized

Abstract: Process Reinforcement Learning~(PRL) has demonstrated considerable potential
in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models~(LLMs).
However, introducing additional process reward models incurs substantial
computational overhead, and there is no unified theoretical framework for
process-level advantage estimation. To bridge this gap, we propose
\textbf{S}elf-Guided \textbf{P}rocess \textbf{R}eward
\textbf{O}ptimization~(\textbf{SPRO}), a novel framework that enables
process-aware RL through two key innovations: (1) we first theoretically
demonstrate that process rewards can be derived intrinsically from the policy
model itself, and (2) we introduce well-defined cumulative process rewards and
\textbf{M}asked \textbf{S}tep \textbf{A}dvantage (\textbf{MSA}), which
facilitates rigorous step-wise action advantage estimation within shared-prompt
sampling groups. Our experimental results demonstrate that SPRO outperforms
vaniila GRPO with 3.4x higher training efficiency and a 17.5\% test accuracy
improvement. Furthermore, SPRO maintains a stable and elevated policy entropy
throughout training while reducing the average response length by approximately

Abstract: Recent work in continual learning has highlighted the beneficial effect of
resampling weights in the last layer of a neural network (``zapping"). Although
empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, the
underlying mechanisms that drive these improvements remain unclear. In this
work, we investigate in detail the pattern of learning and forgetting that take
place inside a convolutional neural network when trained in challenging
settings such as continual learning and few-shot transfer learning, with
handwritten characters and natural images. Our experiments show that models
that have undergone zapping during training more quickly recover from the shock
of transferring to a new domain. Furthermore, to better observe the effect of
continual learning in a multi-task setting we measure how each individual task
is affected. This shows that, not only zapping, but the choice of optimizer can
also deeply affect the dynamics of learning and forgetting, causing complex
patterns of synergy/interference between tasks to emerge when the model learns
sequentially at transfer time.

Abstract: Location information serves as the fundamental element for numerous Internet

Abstract: We propose an efficient online dictionary learning algorithm for kernel-based
sparse representations. In this framework, input signals are nonlinearly mapped
to a high-dimensional feature space and represented sparsely using a virtual
dictionary. At each step, the dictionary is updated recursively using a novel
algorithm based on the recursive least squares (RLS) method. This update
mechanism works with single samples or mini-batches and maintains low
computational complexity. Experiments on four datasets across different domains
show that our method not only outperforms existing online kernel dictionary
learning approaches but also achieves classification accuracy close to that of
batch-trained models, while remaining significantly more efficient.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理梯度时未针对梯度处理专门设计架构，限制了其应用。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Result: GradMetaNet在多种梯度任务（如优化、编辑和曲率估计）中表现优于现有方法，并证明了其普适性。

Conclusion: GradMetaNet为梯度处理提供了一种高效且通用的解决方案，适用于多种任务。

Abstract: Gradients of neural networks encode valuable information for optimization,
editing, and analysis of models. Therefore, practitioners often treat gradients
as inputs to task-specific algorithms, e.g. for pruning or optimization. Recent
works explore learning algorithms that operate directly on gradients but use
architectures that are not specifically designed for gradient processing,
limiting their applicability. In this paper, we present a principled approach
for designing architectures that process gradients. Our approach is guided by
three principles: (1) equivariant design that preserves neuron permutation
symmetries, (2) processing sets of gradients across multiple data points to
capture curvature information, and (3) efficient gradient representation
through rank-1 decomposition. Based on these principles, we introduce
GradMetaNet, a novel architecture for learning on gradients, constructed from
simple equivariant blocks. We prove universality results for GradMetaNet, and
show that previous approaches cannot approximate natural gradient-based
functions that GradMetaNet can. We then demonstrate GradMetaNet's effectiveness
on a diverse set of gradient-based tasks on MLPs and transformers, such as
learned optimization, INR editing, and estimating loss landscape curvature.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RL框架在可扩展性、数据流复杂性和资源闲置方面存在问题，且与LLM训练或推理引擎紧密耦合，难以支持自定义引擎。

Method: 提出AsyncFlow，包括分布式数据存储与传输模块、生产者-消费者异步工作流，并与底层引擎解耦。

Result: 实验显示吞吐量平均提升1.59倍。

Conclusion: AsyncFlow为下一代RL训练系统设计提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a pivotal technology in the
post-training phase of large language models (LLMs). Traditional task-colocated
RL frameworks suffer from significant scalability bottlenecks, while
task-separated RL frameworks face challenges in complex dataflows and the
corresponding resource idling and workload imbalance. Moreover, most existing
frameworks are tightly coupled with LLM training or inference engines, making
it difficult to support custom-designed engines. To address these challenges,
we propose AsyncFlow, an asynchronous streaming RL framework for efficient
post-training. Specifically, we introduce a distributed data storage and
transfer module that provides a unified data management and fine-grained
scheduling capability in a fully streamed manner. This architecture inherently
facilitates automated pipeline overlapping among RL tasks and dynamic load
balancing. Moreover, we propose a producer-consumer-based asynchronous workflow
engineered to minimize computational idleness by strategically deferring
parameter update process within staleness thresholds. Finally, the core
capability of AsynFlow is architecturally decoupled from underlying training
and inference engines and encapsulated by service-oriented user interfaces,
offering a modular and customizable user experience. Extensive experiments
demonstrate an average of 1.59 throughput improvement compared with
state-of-the-art baseline. The presented architecture in this work provides
actionable insights for next-generation RL training system designs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有后训练技术（SFT和RFT）各有优劣，SFT易过度模仿数据，RFT性能敏感且可能学习意外行为。因此，需要一种统一方法结合两者优势。

Method: 提出Prefix-RFT，结合演示和探索学习，通过数学推理问题验证其有效性，并与现有方法对比。

Result: Prefix-RFT性能优于单独SFT和RFT，且对演示数据质量和数量变化具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: Prefix-RFT为LLM后训练提供了新视角，表明结合演示和探索的统一范式是未来研究的潜在方向。

Abstract: Existing post-training techniques for large language models are broadly
categorized into Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Fine-Tuning
(RFT). Each paradigm presents a distinct trade-off: SFT excels at mimicking
demonstration data but can lead to problematic generalization as a form of
behavior cloning. Conversely, RFT can significantly enhance a model's
performance but is prone to learn unexpected behaviors, and its performance is
highly sensitive to the initial policy. In this paper, we propose a unified
view of these methods and introduce Prefix-RFT, a hybrid approach that
synergizes learning from both demonstration and exploration. Using mathematical
reasoning problems as a testbed, we empirically demonstrate that Prefix-RFT is
both simple and effective. It not only surpasses the performance of standalone
SFT and RFT but also outperforms parallel mixed-policy RFT methods. A key
advantage is its seamless integration into existing open-source frameworks,
requiring only minimal modifications to the standard RFT pipeline. Our analysis
highlights the complementary nature of SFT and RFT, and validates that
Prefix-RFT effectively harmonizes these two learning paradigms. Furthermore,
ablation studies confirm the method's robustness to variations in the quality
and quantity of demonstration data. We hope this work offers a new perspective
on LLM post-training, suggesting that a unified paradigm that judiciously
integrates demonstration and exploration could be a promising direction for
future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有审计技术主要关注识别LLM中的潜在不良行为，而本研究旨在解决如何从现有输出中重建输入的问题，以支持事后分析和检测虚假输出报告。

Method: 将精确输入重建形式化为离散优化问题，并引入SODA算法，该算法基于梯度优化，在连续松弛的输入搜索空间中运行，结合周期性重启和参数衰减。

Result: 在33M到3B参数的LLM上实验表明，SODA显著优于现有方法，成功恢复了79.5%的短分布外输入，但对长序列（15+ token）的隐私信息提取效果不佳。

Conclusion: 标准部署实践可能已足够防止恶意使用SODA方法，但该方法在短输入重建中表现优异。

Abstract: While existing auditing techniques attempt to identify potential unwanted
behaviours in large language models (LLMs), we address the complementary
forensic problem of reconstructing the exact input that led to an existing LLM
output - enabling post-incident analysis and potentially the detection of fake
output reports. We formalize exact input reconstruction as a discrete
optimisation problem with a unique global minimum and introduce SODA, an
efficient gradient-based algorithm that operates on a continuous relaxation of
the input search space with periodic restarts and parameter decay. Through
comprehensive experiments on LLMs ranging in size from 33M to 3B parameters, we
demonstrate that SODA significantly outperforms existing approaches. We succeed
in fully recovering 79.5% of shorter out-of-distribution inputs from next-token
logits, without a single false positive, but struggle to extract private
information from the outputs of longer (15+ token) input sequences. This
suggests that standard deployment practices may currently provide adequate
protection against malicious use of our method. Our code is available at

TL;DR: PERTINENCE是一种动态选择预训练模型的方法，通过输入特征复杂度分析，平衡计算效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型DNN模型资源消耗高，而轻量模型对简单输入足够。动态结合模型可提升效率而不损失准确性。

Method: 使用遗传算法训练输入分配器，动态选择最适合的模型处理输入。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和TinyImageNet上，PERTINENCE减少36%计算量，保持或提升准确性。

Conclusion: PERTINENCE通过动态模型选择，有效平衡计算效率和准确性。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have become ubiquitous thanks to their remarkable
ability to model complex patterns across various domains such as computer
vision, speech recognition, robotics, etc. While large DNN models are often
more accurate than simpler, lightweight models, they are also resource- and
energy-hungry. Hence, it is imperative to design methods to reduce reliance on
such large models without significant degradation in output accuracy. The high
computational cost of these models is often necessary only for a reduced set of
challenging inputs, while lighter models can handle most simple ones. Thus,
carefully combining properties of existing DNN models in a dynamic, input-based
way opens opportunities to improve efficiency without impacting accuracy.
  In this work, we introduce PERTINENCE, a novel online method designed to
analyze the complexity of input features and dynamically select the most
suitable model from a pre-trained set to process a given input effectively. To
achieve this, we employ a genetic algorithm to explore the training space of an
ML-based input dispatcher, enabling convergence towards the Pareto front in the
solution space that balances overall accuracy and computational efficiency.
  We showcase our approach on state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs) trained on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, as well as Vision Transformers
(ViTs) trained on TinyImageNet dataset. We report results showing PERTINENCE's
ability to provide alternative solutions to existing state-of-the-art models in
terms of trade-offs between accuracy and number of operations. By
opportunistically selecting among models trained for the same task, PERTINENCE
achieves better or comparable accuracy with up to 36% fewer operations.

Abstract: Estimation of model uncertainty can help improve the explainability of Graph
Convolutional Networks and the accuracy of the models at the same time.
Uncertainty can also be used in critical applications to verify the results of
the model by an expert or additional models. In this paper, we propose
Variational Neural Network versions of spatial and spatio-temporal Graph

attentions of the models, which has the potential for improving model
explainability. We showcase the benefits of these models in the social trading
analysis and the skeleton-based human action recognition tasks on the Finnish
board membership, NTU-60, NTU-120 and Kinetics datasets, where we show
improvement in model accuracy in addition to estimated model uncertainties.

Result: 实验证明RelFCI能有效识别具有潜在混杂因素的关系因果模型中的正确因果结构。

Conclusion: RelFCI填补了关系数据中因果发现的空白，具有理论和实践意义。

Abstract: Estimating causal effects from real-world relational data can be challenging
when the underlying causal model and potential confounders are unknown. While
several causal discovery algorithms exist for learning causal models with
latent confounders from data, they assume that the data is independent and
identically distributed (i.i.d.) and are not well-suited for learning from
relational data. Similarly, existing relational causal discovery algorithms
assume causal sufficiency, which is unrealistic for many real-world datasets.
To address this gap, we propose RelFCI, a sound and complete causal discovery
algorithm for relational data with latent confounders. Our work builds upon the
Fast Causal Inference (FCI) and Relational Causal Discovery (RCD) algorithms
and it defines new graphical models, necessary to support causal discovery in
relational domains. We also establish soundness and completeness guarantees for
relational d-separation with latent confounders. We present experimental
results demonstrating the effectiveness of RelFCI in identifying the correct
causal structure in relational causal models with latent confounders.

Conclusion: 贝叶斯PINN是一种数学上更严谨的方法，能有效提升PINN的性能。

Abstract: Training physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for forward problems often
suffers from severe convergence issues, hindering the propagation of
information from regions where the desired solution is well-defined.
Haitsiukevich and Ilin (2023) proposed an ensemble approach that extends the
active training domain of each PINN based on i) ensemble consensus and ii)
vicinity to (pseudo-)labeled points, thus ensuring that the information from
the initial condition successfully propagates to the interior of the
computational domain.
  In this work, we suggest replacing the ensemble by a Bayesian PINN, and
consensus by an evaluation of the PINN's posterior variance. Our experiments
show that this mathematically principled approach outperforms the ensemble on a
set of benchmark problems and is competitive with PINN ensembles trained with
combinations of Adam and LBFGS.

Result: 现有方法在特定任务中表现良好，但在复杂任务中效果下降，需算法选择和新方向如元学习。

Conclusion: AutoML社区需关注更相关的测试任务和新兴方法（如元学习）以提升学习率控制的效果。

Abstract: The learning rate is one of the most important hyperparameters in deep
learning, and how to control it is an active area within both AutoML and deep
learning research. Approaches for learning rate control span from classic
optimization to online scheduling based on gradient statistics. This paper
compares paradigms to assess the current state of learning rate control. We
find that methods from multi-fidelity hyperparameter optimization,
fixed-hyperparameter schedules, and hyperparameter-free learning often perform
very well on selected deep learning tasks but are not reliable across settings.
This highlights the need for algorithm selection methods in learning rate
control, which have been neglected so far by both the AutoML and deep learning
communities. We also observe a trend of hyperparameter optimization approaches
becoming less effective as models and tasks grow in complexity, even when
combined with multi-fidelity approaches for more expensive model trainings. A
focus on more relevant test tasks and new promising directions like finetunable
methods and meta-learning will enable the AutoML community to significantly
strengthen its impact on this crucial factor in deep learning.

Abstract: Accurately estimating parameters of physiological models is essential to
achieving reliable digital twins. For Type 1 Diabetes, this is particularly
challenging due to the complexity of glucose-insulin interactions. Traditional
methods based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo struggle with high-dimensional
parameter spaces and fit parameters from scratch at inference time, making them
slow and computationally expensive. In this study, we propose a
Simulation-Based Inference approach based on Neural Posterior Estimation to
efficiently capture the complex relationships between meal intake, insulin, and
glucose level, providing faster, amortized inference. Our experiments
demonstrate that SBI not only outperforms traditional methods in parameter
estimation but also generalizes better to unseen conditions, offering real-time
posterior inference with reliable uncertainty quantification.

Conclusion: BBoxER是梯度优化方法的有力补充，适用于隐私敏感和高风险环境。

Abstract: Gradient-based optimization is the workhorse of deep learning, offering
efficient and scalable training via backpropagation. However, its reliance on
large volumes of labeled data raises privacy and security concerns such as
susceptibility to data poisoning attacks and the risk of overfitting. In
contrast, black box optimization methods, which treat the model as an opaque
function, relying solely on function evaluations to guide optimization, offer a
promising alternative in scenarios where data access is restricted, adversarial
risks are high, or overfitting is a concern. However, black box methods also
pose significant challenges, including poor scalability to high-dimensional
parameter spaces, as prevalent in large language models (LLMs), and high
computational costs due to reliance on numerous model evaluations. This paper
introduces BBoxER, an evolutionary black-box method for LLM post-training that
induces an information bottleneck via implicit compression of the training
data. Leveraging the tractability of information flow, we provide strong
theoretical bounds on generalization, differential privacy, susceptibility to
data poisoning attacks, and robustness to extraction attacks. BBoxER operates
on top of pre-trained LLMs, offering a lightweight and modular enhancement
suitable for deployment in restricted or privacy-sensitive environments, in
addition to non-vacuous generalization guarantees. In experiments with LLMs, we
demonstrate empirically that Retrofitting methods are able to learn, showing
how a few iterations of BBoxER improve performance and generalize well on a
benchmark of reasoning datasets. This positions BBoxER as an attractive add-on
on top of gradient-based optimization.

Motivation: 生成模型在关键应用中的使用受到样本质量评估不可靠的限制，现有指标缺乏校准和鲁棒性。

Method: 通过剪裁单个样本贡献和最近邻球的半径，提出Clipped Density和Clipped Coverage指标，防止异常样本影响聚合值。

Result: 新指标在合成和真实数据集上表现出更高的鲁棒性、敏感性和可解释性。

Conclusion: Clipped Density和Clipped Coverage为生成模型样本质量评估提供了更可靠的工具。

Abstract: Although generative models have made remarkable progress in recent years,
their use in critical applications has been hindered by their incapacity to
reliably evaluate sample quality. Quality refers to at least two complementary
concepts: fidelity and coverage. Current quality metrics often lack reliable,
interpretable values due to an absence of calibration or insufficient
robustness to outliers. To address these shortcomings, we introduce two novel
metrics, Clipped Density and Clipped Coverage. By clipping individual sample
contributions and, for fidelity, the radii of nearest neighbor balls, our
metrics prevent out-of-distribution samples from biasing the aggregated values.
Through analytical and empirical calibration, these metrics exhibit linear
score degradation as the proportion of poor samples increases. Thus, they can
be straightforwardly interpreted as equivalent proportions of good samples.
Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that
Clipped Density and Clipped Coverage outperform existing methods in terms of
robustness, sensitivity, and interpretability for evaluating generative models.

accuracy, with statistically significant gains. We detail the architecture,

Conclusion: 提供了一种实用且易于访问的GPU微调替代方案。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adapters (LoRAs) have transformed the fine-tuning of Large Language
Models (LLMs) by enabling parameter-efficient updates. However, their
widespread adoption remains limited by the reliance on GPU-based training. In
this work, we propose a theoretically grounded approach to LoRA fine-tuning
designed specifically for users with limited computational resources,
particularly those restricted to standard laptop CPUs. Our method learns a
meta-operator that maps any input dataset, represented as a probability
distribution, to a set of LoRA weights by leveraging a large bank of
pre-trained adapters for the Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 model. Instead of
performing new gradient-based updates, our pipeline constructs adapters via
lightweight combinations of existing LoRAs directly on CPU. While the resulting
adapters do not match the performance of GPU-trained counterparts, they

Motivation: 探索GNN在解决SAT问题上的潜力，结合MILP技术提升性能。

Method: 将k-CNF公式映射为MILP问题，编码为加权二分图，输入GNN进行训练和测试。

Result: 理论证明方法的稳定性和局限性，实验显示方法简单有效。

Conclusion: 该方法在理论和实验上均表现出色，为GNN解决SAT问题提供了新思路。

Abstract: We proposes a novel method that enables Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to solve
SAT problems by leveraging a technique developed for applying GNNs to Mixed
Integer Linear Programming (MILP). Specifically, k-CNF formulae are mapped into
MILP problems, which are then encoded as weighted bipartite graphs and
subsequently fed into a GNN for training and testing. From a theoretical
perspective: (i) we establish permutation and equivalence invariance results,
demonstrating that the method produces outputs that are stable under reordering
of clauses and variables; (ii) we identify a theoretical limitation, showing
that for a class of formulae called foldable formulae, standard GNNs cannot
always distinguish satisfiable from unsatisfiable instances; (iii) we prove a
universal approximation theorem, establishing that with Random Node
Initialization (RNI), the method can approximate SAT solving to arbitrary
precision on finite datasets, that is, the GNN becomes approximately sound and
complete on such datasets. Furthermore, we show that for unfoldable formulae,
the same approximation guarantee can be achieved without the need for RNI.
Finally, we conduct an experimental evaluation of our approach, which show
that, despite the simplicity of the neural architecture, the method achieves
promising results.

*Tristan Torchet,Christian Metzner,Laura Kriener,Melika Payvand*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: mGRADE是一种混合内存系统，结合了1D卷积和最小门控循环单元，适用于边缘设备的多尺度时间处理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 边缘设备需要同时捕捉短时和长时动态的模型，但现有方法（如Transformers、RNNs和TCNs）在内存或效率上存在不足。

Method: 提出mGRADE，结合1D卷积（可学习间距）和minGRU，卷积层捕捉快速变化，循环模块维持全局上下文。

Result: 在合成任务和图像分类基准上，mGRADE优于纯卷积和循环模型，内存占用减少20%。

Conclusion: mGRADE是内存受限边缘设备的高效解决方案。

Abstract: Edge devices for temporal processing demand models that capture both short-
and long- range dynamics under tight memory constraints. While Transformers
excel at sequence modeling, their quadratic memory scaling with sequence length
makes them impractical for such settings. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
offer constant memory but train sequentially, and Temporal Convolutional
Networks (TCNs), though efficient, scale memory with kernel size. To address
this, we propose mGRADE (mininally Gated Recurrent Architecture with Delay
Embedding), a hybrid-memory system that integrates a temporal 1D-convolution
with learnable spacings followed by a minimal gated recurrent unit (minGRU).
This design allows the convolutional layer to realize a flexible delay
embedding that captures rapid temporal variations, while the recurrent module
efficiently maintains global context with minimal memory overhead. We validate
our approach on two synthetic tasks, demonstrating that mGRADE effectively
separates and preserves multi-scale temporal features. Furthermore, on
challenging pixel-by-pixel image classification benchmarks, mGRADE consistently
outperforms both pure convolutional and pure recurrent counterparts using
approximately 20% less memory footprint, highlighting its suitability for
memory-constrained temporal processing at the edge. This highlights mGRADE's
promise as an efficient solution for memory-constrained multi-scale temporal
processing at the edge.

TL;DR: 论文重新审视了基于预测不确定性和特征的OOD检测方法，指出这些方法存在根本性问题，无法有效识别OOD数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有OOD检测方法依赖监督模型的预测不确定性或特征，但这些方法未能正确解决OOD检测的核心问题。

Method: 通过分析不确定性方法和特征方法的局限性，探讨了密度估计和生成模型的可行性。

Result: 研究发现现有方法存在不可约误差，且常见干预措施无法解决目标不一致问题。

Conclusion: OOD检测需要重新思考方法设计，现有技术存在根本性限制。

Abstract: To detect distribution shifts and improve model safety, many
out-of-distribution (OOD) detection methods rely on the predictive uncertainty
or features of supervised models trained on in-distribution data. In this
paper, we critically re-examine this popular family of OOD detection
procedures, and we argue that these methods are fundamentally answering the
wrong questions for OOD detection. There is no simple fix to this misalignment,
since a classifier trained only on in-distribution classes cannot be expected
to identify OOD points; for instance, a cat-dog classifier may confidently
misclassify an airplane if it contains features that distinguish cats from
dogs, despite generally appearing nothing alike. We find that uncertainty-based
methods incorrectly conflate high uncertainty with being OOD, while
feature-based methods incorrectly conflate far feature-space distance with
being OOD. We show how these pathologies manifest as irreducible errors in OOD
detection and identify common settings where these methods are ineffective.
Additionally, interventions to improve OOD detection such as feature-logit
hybrid methods, scaling of model and data size, epistemic uncertainty
representation, and outlier exposure also fail to address this fundamental
misalignment in objectives. We additionally consider unsupervised density
estimation and generative models for OOD detection, which we show have their
own fundamental limitations.

*Yihang Gao,Vincent Y. F. Tan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SubLoRA是一种基于子模函数最大化的LoRA秩确定方法，利用二阶信息（Hessian矩阵）改进现有线性化方法的不足，并通过贪心算法实现高效计算。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如AdaLoRA）依赖损失函数的一阶近似，但在LoRA参数优化良好时线性化不准确且病态，因此需要更可靠的二阶方法。

Method: 将秩确定问题转化为组合优化问题，引入子模函数最大化框架和贪心算法，并构造满足条件的Hessian矩阵闭式投影。

Result: 在物理信息神经网络（PINNs）的微调实验中，SubLoRA在秩确定和联合训练性能上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SubLoRA结合了理论基础、二阶精度和计算效率，为LoRA秩确定提供了更优解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose SubLoRA, a rank determination method for Low-Rank
Adaptation (LoRA) based on submodular function maximization. In contrast to
prior approaches, such as AdaLoRA, that rely on first-order (linearized)
approximations of the loss function, SubLoRA utilizes second-order information
to capture the potentially complex loss landscape by incorporating the Hessian
matrix. We show that the linearization becomes inaccurate and ill-conditioned
when the LoRA parameters have been well optimized, motivating the need for a
more reliable and nuanced second-order formulation. To this end, we reformulate
the rank determination problem as a combinatorial optimization problem with a
quadratic objective. However, solving this problem exactly is NP-hard in
general. To overcome the computational challenge, we introduce a submodular
function maximization framework and devise a greedy algorithm with
approximation guarantees. We derive a sufficient and necessary condition under
which the rank-determination objective becomes submodular, and construct a
closed-form projection of the Hessian matrix that satisfies this condition
while maintaining computational efficiency. Our method combines solid
theoretical foundations, second-order accuracy, and practical computational
efficiency. We further extend SubLoRA to a joint optimization setting,
alternating between LoRA parameter updates and rank determination under a rank
budget constraint. Extensive experiments on fine-tuning physics-informed neural
networks (PINNs) for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) demonstrate
the effectiveness of our approach. Results show that SubLoRA outperforms
existing methods in both rank determination and joint training performance.

Motivation: 受大型预训练基础模型成功的启发，研究如何利用这些模型处理时间序列数据中的复杂模式，以实现高精度的建模、预测和异常检测。

Method: 结合VAE和DCNN，构建了一个通用的单变量时间序列模型FAE，通过大规模预训练学习复杂时间模式。

Result: 在多个多维时间序列数据集（包括移动ISP的真实数据和KDD 2021异常检测数据集）上展示了初步结果。

Conclusion: FAE作为一种基础生成AI模型，具有在零样本异常检测任务中直接应用的潜力。

Abstract: We investigate a novel approach to time-series modeling, inspired by the
successes of large pretrained foundation models. We introduce FAE (Foundation
Auto-Encoders), a foundation generative-AI model for anomaly detection in
time-series data, based on Variational Auto-Encoders (VAEs). By foundation, we
mean a model pretrained on massive amounts of time-series data which can learn
complex temporal patterns useful for accurate modeling, forecasting, and
detection of anomalies on previously unseen datasets. FAE leverages VAEs and
Dilated Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) to build a generic model for
univariate time-series modeling, which could eventually perform properly in
out-of-the-box, zero-shot anomaly detection applications. We introduce the main
concepts of FAE, and present preliminary results in different multi-dimensional
time-series datasets from various domains, including a real dataset from an
operational mobile ISP, and the well known KDD 2021 Anomaly Detection dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心理健康账单的复杂性导致异常（如欺诈）频发，而传统机器学习方法在类别不平衡、标签稀缺和复杂序列模式上表现不佳。

Method: 采用混合深度学习方法（LSTM+Transformer），结合iForest和AE进行伪标记，并在两个真实账单数据集上评估。

Result: 在声明级数据上，iForest LSTM基线模型召回率最高（0.963）；在操作级数据上，混合iForest模型召回率最高（0.744），但精度较低。

Conclusion: 研究证明了伪标记与混合深度学习在复杂不平衡异常检测中的潜力。

Abstract: The complexity of mental healthcare billing enables anomalies, including
fraud. While machine learning methods have been applied to anomaly detection,
they often struggle with class imbalance, label scarcity, and complex
sequential patterns. This study explores a hybrid deep learning approach
combining Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Transformers, with
pseudo-labeling via Isolation Forests (iForest) and Autoencoders (AE). Prior
work has not evaluated such hybrid models trained on pseudo-labeled data in the
context of healthcare billing. The approach is evaluated on two real-world
billing datasets related to mental healthcare. The iForest LSTM baseline
achieves the highest recall (0.963) on declaration-level data. On the
operation-level data, the hybrid iForest-based model achieves the highest
recall (0.744), though at the cost of lower precision. These findings highlight
the potential of combining pseudo-labeling with hybrid deep learning in
complex, imbalanced anomaly detection settings.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在通过统一接口整合策略模型和过程奖励模型，减少额外标注和参数需求，提升推理效率。

Method: 采用共享主干网络和任务特定头，结合SPRM实现自监督训练，支持可控思维长度的测试时间扩展（TTS）。

Result: MetaStone-S1在32B参数规模下性能与OpenAI-o3-mini系列相当，并建立了计算量与TTS性能的缩放定律。

Conclusion: MetaStone-S1为高效推理提供了一种新方法，并开源以支持研究社区。

Abstract: We introduce our first reflective generative model MetaStone-S1, which
obtains OpenAI o3's performance via the self-supervised process reward model
(SPRM). Through sharing the backbone network and using task-specific heads for
next token prediction and process scoring respectively, SPRM successfully
integrates the policy model and process reward model(PRM) into a unified
interface without extra process annotation, reducing over 99% PRM parameters
for efficient reasoning. Equipped with SPRM, MetaStone-S1 is naturally suitable
for test time scaling (TTS), and we provide three reasoning effort modes (low,
medium, and high), based on the controllable thinking length. Moreover, we
empirically establish a scaling law that reveals the relationship between total
thinking computation and TTS performance. Experiments demonstrate that our
MetaStone-S1 achieves comparable performance to OpenAI-o3-mini's series with
only 32B parameter size. To support the research community, we have
open-sourced MetaStone-S1 at https://github.com/MetaStone-AI/MetaStone-S1.
