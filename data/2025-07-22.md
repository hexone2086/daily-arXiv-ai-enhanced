*Andreas Alpers,Orkun Furat,Christian Jung,Matthias Neumann,Claudia Redenbach,Aigerim Saken,Volker Schmidt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 比较分析用于拟合3D图像数据的镶嵌模型算法策略，评估优化方法在生成近似体素结构时的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在材料科学中，准确拟合3D图像数据（如多晶体和泡沫）的镶嵌模型是一个不断发展的领域，需要评估不同优化方法的适用性。

Method: 采用线性/非线性规划、随机优化（交叉熵法）和梯度下降等方法，生成Voronoi、Laguerre和广义平衡功率图（GBPDs）。

Result: 通过真实数据集评估拟合质量，发现模型复杂度、优化方法复杂度和近似质量之间存在权衡。

Conclusion: 研究结果为根据数据特征和应用需求选择合适方法提供了指导。

Abstract: This paper presents a comparative analysis of algorithmic strategies for
fitting tessellation models to 3D image data of materials such as polycrystals
and foams. In this steadily advancing field, we review and assess
optimization-based methods -- including linear and nonlinear programming,
stochastic optimization via the cross-entropy method, and gradient descent --
for generating Voronoi, Laguerre, and generalized balanced power diagrams
(GBPDs) that approximate voxelbased grain structures. The quality of fit is
evaluated on real-world datasets using discrepancy measures that quantify
differences in grain volume, surface area, and topology. Our results highlight
trade-offs between model complexity, the complexity of the optimization
routines involved, and the quality of approximation, providing guidance for
selecting appropriate methods based on data characteristics and application
needs.

### [2] [Semantic Segmentation based Scene Understanding in Autonomous Vehicles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14303)
*Ehsan Rassekh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文探讨了深度学习在自动驾驶场景理解中的应用，提出了几种高效的语义分割模型，并研究了不同主干网络对模型性能的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人工智能和深度学习在解决复杂任务中表现出色，尤其在自动驾驶领域。研究旨在通过语义分割提升场景理解能力。

Method: 使用BDD100k数据集，提出多种高效模型，并尝试不同主干网络作为编码器。

Result: 结果显示主干网络的选择对语义分割性能有显著影响，模型在准确性、平均IoU和损失函数方面表现提升。

Conclusion: 研究表明，选择合适的骨干网络能显著提升语义分割性能，从而更好地理解场景和环境。

Abstract: In recent years, the concept of artificial intelligence (AI) has become a
prominent keyword because it is promising in solving complex tasks. The need
for human expertise in specific areas may no longer be needed because machines
have achieved successful results using artificial intelligence and can make the
right decisions in critical situations. This process is possible with the help
of deep learning (DL), one of the most popular artificial intelligence
technologies. One of the areas in which the use of DL is used is in the
development of self-driving cars, which is very effective and important. In
this work, we propose several efficient models to investigate scene
understanding through semantic segmentation. We use the BDD100k dataset to
investigate these models. Another contribution of this work is the usage of
several Backbones as encoders for models. The obtained results show that
choosing the appropriate backbone has a great effect on the performance of the
model for semantic segmentation. Better performance in semantic segmentation
allows us to understand better the scene and the environment around the agent.
In the end, we analyze and evaluate the proposed models in terms of accuracy,
mean IoU, and loss function, and the results show that these metrics are
improved.

### [3] [CLIPTTA: Robust Contrastive Vision-Language Test-Time Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14312)
*Marc Lafon,Gustavo Adolfo Vargas Hakim,Clément Rambour,Christian Desrosier,Nicolas Thome*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLIPTTA是一种基于梯度的测试时适应方法，针对视觉语言模型（VLMs）的分布偏移问题，通过软对比损失和改进的OOD检测，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型（如CLIP）在零样本任务中表现优异，但在分布偏移下泛化能力不足。传统的熵最小化目标与对比训练不匹配，导致性能受限。

Method: 提出CLIPTTA方法，采用软对比损失与CLIP预训练目标对齐，并通过理论分析优化梯度设计。进一步引入OCE损失改进OOD检测。

Result: 在75个数据集上的实验表明，CLIPTTA优于基于熵的方法，并在多样分布偏移下表现稳定，优于现有TTA方法。

Conclusion: CLIPTTA通过对齐预训练目标和改进OOD检测，显著提升了视觉语言模型在分布偏移下的适应能力。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP exhibit strong zero-shot capabilities
but often fail to generalize under distribution shifts. Test-time adaptation
(TTA) allows models to update at inference time without labeled data, typically
via entropy minimization. However, this objective is fundamentally misaligned
with the contrastive image-text training of VLMs, limiting adaptation
performance and introducing failure modes such as pseudo-label drift and class
collapse. We propose CLIPTTA, a new gradient-based TTA method for
vision-language models that leverages a soft contrastive loss aligned with
CLIP's pre-training objective. We provide a theoretical analysis of CLIPTTA's
gradients, showing how its batch-aware design mitigates the risk of collapse.
We further extend CLIPTTA to the open-set setting, where both in-distribution
(ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) samples are encountered, using an Outlier
Contrastive Exposure (OCE) loss to improve OOD detection. Evaluated on 75
datasets spanning diverse distribution shifts, CLIPTTA consistently outperforms
entropy-based objectives and is highly competitive with state-of-the-art TTA
methods, outperforming them on a large number of datasets and exhibiting more
stable performance across diverse shifts.

### [4] [A Hidden Stumbling Block in Generalized Category Discovery: Distracted Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14315)
*Qiyu Xu,Zhanxuan Hu,Yu Duan,Ercheng Pei,Yonghang Tai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为注意力聚焦（AF）的机制，通过剪除非信息性标记来解决广义类别发现（GCD）中的注意力分散问题，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GCD方法在处理未标记数据时，模型注意力容易被任务无关的背景区域分散，导致特征提取不理想。

Method: AF由两个组件组成：标记重要性度量（TIME）和多尺度标记自适应剪枝（TAP），通过量化标记重要性并剪除非信息性标记来优化注意力。

Result: 将AF集成到SimGCD方法中，性能提升了15.4%，且计算开销极小。

Conclusion: AF是一种轻量级、即插即用的模块，能有效提升GCD任务的性能。

Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) aims to classify unlabeled data from
both known and unknown categories by leveraging knowledge from labeled known
categories. While existing methods have made notable progress, they often
overlook a hidden stumbling block in GCD: distracted attention. Specifically,
when processing unlabeled data, models tend to focus not only on key objects in
the image but also on task-irrelevant background regions, leading to suboptimal
feature extraction. To remove this stumbling block, we propose Attention
Focusing (AF), an adaptive mechanism designed to sharpen the model's focus by
pruning non-informative tokens. AF consists of two simple yet effective
components: Token Importance Measurement (TIME) and Token Adaptive Pruning
(TAP), working in a cascade. TIME quantifies token importance across multiple
scales, while TAP prunes non-informative tokens by utilizing the multi-scale
importance scores provided by TIME. AF is a lightweight, plug-and-play module
that integrates seamlessly into existing GCD methods with minimal computational
overhead. When incorporated into one prominent GCD method, SimGCD, AF achieves
up to 15.4% performance improvement over the baseline with minimal
computational overhead. The implementation code is provided in
https://github.com/Afleve/AFGCD.

### [5] [Hallucination Score: Towards Mitigating Hallucinations in Generative Image Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14367)
*Weiming Ren,Raghav Goyal,Zhiming Hu,Tristan Ty Aumentado-Armstrong,Iqbal Mohomed,Alex Levinshtein*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种测量和减少生成超分辨率（GSR）中幻觉（hallucinations）的方法，利用多模态大语言模型（MLLM）生成“幻觉分数”（HS），并通过深度特征对齐模型以减少幻觉。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成超分辨率（GSR）在感知图像质量上表现优异，但存在幻觉问题，即生成细节与低分辨率图像（LRI）或真实图像（GTI）不匹配，这一问题限制了GSR的实际应用。

Method: 利用多模态大语言模型（MLLM）构建提示，评估幻觉视觉元素并生成“幻觉分数”（HS）；发现某些深度特征距离与HS强相关，提出用这些特征作为可微奖励函数对齐GSR模型。

Result: HS与人类评估高度一致，并为超分辨率（SR）模型的图像指标提供补充见解；深度特征距离与HS强相关。

Conclusion: 通过HS和深度特征对齐GSR模型，可以有效减少幻觉问题，提升模型的实用性和感知质量。

Abstract: Generative super-resolution (GSR) currently sets the state-of-the-art in
terms of perceptual image quality, overcoming the "regression-to-the-mean" blur
of prior non-generative models. However, from a human perspective, such models
do not fully conform to the optimal balance between quality and fidelity.
Instead, a different class of artifacts, in which generated details fail to
perceptually match the low resolution image (LRI) or ground-truth image (GTI),
is a critical but under studied issue in GSR, limiting its practical
deployments. In this work, we focus on measuring, analyzing, and mitigating
these artifacts (i.e., "hallucinations"). We observe that hallucinations are
not well-characterized with existing image metrics or quality models, as they
are orthogonal to both exact fidelity and no-reference quality. Instead, we
take advantage of a multimodal large language model (MLLM) by constructing a
prompt that assesses hallucinatory visual elements and generates a
"Hallucination Score" (HS). We find that our HS is closely aligned with human
evaluations, and also provides complementary insights to prior image metrics
used for super-resolution (SR) models. In addition, we find certain deep
feature distances have strong correlations with HS. We therefore propose to
align the GSR models by using such features as differentiable reward functions
to mitigate hallucinations.

### [6] [DUSTrack: Semi-automated point tracking in ultrasound videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14368)
*Praneeth Namburi,Roger Pallarès-López,Jessica Rosendorf,Duarte Folgado,Brian W. Anthony*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DUSTrack是一个结合深度学习和光流的半自动化工具包，用于在B模式超声视频中跟踪任意点，解决了传统方法中因斑点噪声和低对比度导致的跟踪难题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: B模式超声中的组织运动跟踪因斑点噪声、低边缘对比度和平面外运动而具有挑战性，需要一种更准确和通用的解决方案。

Method: DUSTrack结合深度学习和光流技术，提供图形用户界面以生成高质量训练数据，并采用新型光流滤波技术减少噪声。

Result: DUSTrack在准确性上优于零样本点跟踪器，与专业方法相当，适用于多种解剖结构和运动模式。

Conclusion: DUSTrack是一个开源工具，为临床和生物力学研究提供了强大且灵活的组织运动量化框架。

Abstract: Ultrasound technology enables safe, non-invasive imaging of dynamic tissue
behavior, making it a valuable tool in medicine, biomechanics, and sports
science. However, accurately tracking tissue motion in B-mode ultrasound
remains challenging due to speckle noise, low edge contrast, and out-of-plane
movement. These challenges complicate the task of tracking anatomical landmarks
over time, which is essential for quantifying tissue dynamics in many clinical
and research applications. This manuscript introduces DUSTrack (Deep learning
and optical flow-based toolkit for UltraSound Tracking), a semi-automated
framework for tracking arbitrary points in B-mode ultrasound videos. We combine
deep learning with optical flow to deliver high-quality and robust tracking
across diverse anatomical structures and motion patterns. The toolkit includes
a graphical user interface that streamlines the generation of high-quality
training data and supports iterative model refinement. It also implements a
novel optical-flow-based filtering technique that reduces high-frequency
frame-to-frame noise while preserving rapid tissue motion. DUSTrack
demonstrates superior accuracy compared to contemporary zero-shot point
trackers and performs on par with specialized methods, establishing its
potential as a general and foundational tool for clinical and biomechanical
research. We demonstrate DUSTrack's versatility through three use cases:
cardiac wall motion tracking in echocardiograms, muscle deformation analysis
during reaching tasks, and fascicle tracking during ankle plantarflexion. As an
open-source solution, DUSTrack offers a powerful, flexible framework for point
tracking to quantify tissue motion from ultrasound videos. DUSTrack is
available at https://github.com/praneethnamburi/DUSTrack.

### [7] [CRAFT: A Neuro-Symbolic Framework for Visual Functional Affordance Grounding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14426)
*Zhou Chen,Joe Lin,Sathyanarayanan N. Aakur*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CRAFT是一个神经符号框架，用于可解释的affordance grounding，结合了常识先验和视觉证据，通过能量推理循环迭代优化预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决场景理解中对象与动作关联的可解释性问题，提升准确性和透明度。

Method: 整合ConceptNet和语言模型的结构化常识先验与CLIP的视觉证据，采用基于能量的推理循环迭代优化预测。

Result: 在多对象、无标签设置下，CRAFT提高了准确性并增强了可解释性。

Conclusion: CRAFT为稳健且可信的场景理解提供了新方向。

Abstract: We introduce CRAFT, a neuro-symbolic framework for interpretable affordance
grounding, which identifies the objects in a scene that enable a given action
(e.g., "cut"). CRAFT integrates structured commonsense priors from ConceptNet
and language models with visual evidence from CLIP, using an energy-based
reasoning loop to refine predictions iteratively. This process yields
transparent, goal-driven decisions to ground symbolic and perceptual
structures. Experiments in multi-object, label-free settings demonstrate that
CRAFT enhances accuracy while improving interpretability, providing a step
toward robust and trustworthy scene understanding.

### [8] [Adaptive 3D Gaussian Splatting Video Streaming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14432)
*Han Gong,Qiyue Li,Zhi Liu,Hao Zhou,Peng Yuan Zhou,Zhu Li,Jie Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于高斯变形场的3DGS视频流媒体框架，通过混合显著性分块和差异化质量建模，实现了高效压缩和带宽适应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3DGS视频数据量大且传输复杂，传统方法难以满足需求。

Method: 设计高斯变形场构建3DGS视频，采用混合显著性分块和差异化质量建模。

Result: 实验验证了方法在视频质量、压缩效率和传输速率上的优越性。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了3DGS视频流媒体的挑战。

Abstract: The advent of 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) has significantly enhanced the
quality of volumetric video representation. Meanwhile, in contrast to
conventional volumetric video, 3DGS video poses significant challenges for
streaming due to its substantially larger data volume and the heightened
complexity involved in compression and transmission. To address these issues,
we introduce an innovative framework for 3DGS volumetric video streaming.
Specifically, we design a 3DGS video construction method based on the Gaussian
deformation field. By employing hybrid saliency tiling and differentiated
quality modeling of 3DGS video, we achieve efficient data compression and
adaptation to bandwidth fluctuations while ensuring high transmission quality.
Then we build a complete 3DGS video streaming system and validate the
transmission performance. Through experimental evaluation, our method
demonstrated superiority over existing approaches in various aspects, including
video quality, compression effectiveness, and transmission rate.

### [9] [IRGPT: Understanding Real-world Infrared Image with Bi-cross-modal Curriculum on Large-scale Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14449)
*Zhe Cao,Jin Zhang,Ruiheng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IRGPT是首个针对真实红外图像的多模态大语言模型，基于26万对真实红外图像-文本数据集（IR-TD），通过双向跨模态课程迁移学习策略，在9项任务中达到最优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 真实红外图像缺乏对齐的文本数据和领域特性，现有方法依赖合成图像，无法捕捉红外模态的独特特征。

Method: 构建IR-TD数据集，结合LLM生成和规则化描述；提出双向跨模态课程迁移学习策略。

Result: 在9项任务中表现最优，超越更大规模模型。

Conclusion: IRGPT通过真实数据集和迁移学习策略，解决了红外图像领域的关键挑战。

Abstract: Real-world infrared imagery presents unique challenges for vision-language
models due to the scarcity of aligned text data and domain-specific
characteristics. Although existing methods have advanced the field, their
reliance on synthetic infrared images generated through style transfer from
visible images, which limits their ability to capture the unique
characteristics of the infrared modality. To address this, we propose IRGPT,
the first multi-modal large language model for real-world infrared images,
built upon a large-scale InfraRed-Text Dataset (IR-TD) comprising over 260K
authentic image-text pairs. The proposed IR-TD dataset contains real infrared
images paired with meticulously handcrafted texts, where the initial drafts
originated from two complementary processes: (1) LLM-generated descriptions of
visible images, and (2) rule-based descriptions of annotations. Furthermore, we
introduce a bi-cross-modal curriculum transfer learning strategy that
systematically transfers knowledge from visible to infrared domains by
considering the difficulty scores of both infrared-visible and infrared-text.
Evaluated on a benchmark of 9 tasks (e.g., recognition, grounding), IRGPT
achieves state-of-the-art performance even compared with larger-scale models.

### [10] [GPI-Net: Gestalt-Guided Parallel Interaction Network via Orthogonal Geometric Consistency for Robust Point Cloud Registration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14452)
*Weikang Gu,Mingyue Han,Li Xue,Heng Dong,Changcai Yang,Riqing Chen,Lifang Wei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Gestalt原则的并行交互网络（GPI-Net），用于点云配准中的高质量对应关系识别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决局部和全局特征融合中的冗余和复杂空间关系问题。

Method: 利用Gestalt原则设计正交几何一致性策略，结合Gestalt特征注意力块和双路径多粒度并行交互聚合块。

Result: 在多个挑战性任务中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GPI-Net通过Gestalt原则优化特征融合，显著提升了点云配准的准确性。

Abstract: The accurate identification of high-quality correspondences is a prerequisite
task in feature-based point cloud registration. However, it is extremely
challenging to handle the fusion of local and global features due to feature
redundancy and complex spatial relationships. Given that Gestalt principles
provide key advantages in analyzing local and global relationships, we propose
a novel Gestalt-guided Parallel Interaction Network via orthogonal geometric
consistency (GPI-Net) in this paper. It utilizes Gestalt principles to
facilitate complementary communication between local and global information.
Specifically, we introduce an orthogonal integration strategy to optimally
reduce redundant information and generate a more compact global structure for
high-quality correspondences. To capture geometric features in correspondences,
we leverage a Gestalt Feature Attention (GFA) block through a hybrid
utilization of self-attention and cross-attention mechanisms. Furthermore, to
facilitate the integration of local detail information into the global
structure, we design an innovative Dual-path Multi-Granularity parallel
interaction aggregation (DMG) block to promote information exchange across
different granularities. Extensive experiments on various challenging tasks
demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed GPI-Net in comparison to
existing methods. The code will be released at https://github.com/gwk/GPI-Net.

Result: 实验表明，所提方法在性能上显著优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 本文解决方案有效解决了3DGS视频流的关键挑战，为未来研究提供了重要参考。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian splatting video (3DGS) streaming has recently emerged as a
research hotspot in both academia and industry, owing to its impressive ability
to deliver immersive 3D video experiences. However, research in this area is
still in its early stages, and several fundamental challenges, such as tiling,
quality assessment, and bitrate adaptation, require further investigation. In
this paper, we tackle these challenges by proposing a comprehensive set of
solutions. Specifically, we propose an adaptive 3DGS tiling technique guided by
saliency analysis, which integrates both spatial and temporal features. Each
tile is encoded into versions possessing dedicated deformation fields and
multiple quality levels for adaptive selection. We also introduce a novel
quality assessment framework for 3DGS video that jointly evaluates
spatial-domain degradation in 3DGS representations during streaming and the
quality of the resulting 2D rendered images. Additionally, we develop a
meta-learning-based adaptive bitrate algorithm specifically tailored for 3DGS
video streaming, achieving optimal performance across varying network
conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed approaches
significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods.

*Chi Wan,Yixin Cui,Jiatong Du,Shuo Yang,Yulong Bai,Yanjun Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GEMINUS是一种基于混合专家（Mixture-of-Experts）的端到端自动驾驶框架，通过全局专家、场景自适应专家组和双感知路由器实现多样化和鲁棒的驾驶性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有单模式规划方法难以处理多样化交通场景，需要一种能够自适应和鲁棒地应对复杂环境的框架。

Method: GEMINUS结合全局专家（整体数据集训练）和场景自适应专家（子集训练），通过双感知路由器动态激活专家模块。

Result: 在Bench2Drive基准测试中表现优异，驾驶评分和成功率均达到最优，单目视觉输入下仍有显著提升。

Conclusion: GEMINUS通过混合专家框架实现了自适应和鲁棒的自动驾驶性能，显著优于单专家基线方法。

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving requires adaptive and robust handling of
complex and diverse traffic environments. However, prevalent single-mode
planning methods attempt to learn an overall policy while struggling to acquire
diversified driving skills to handle diverse scenarios. Therefore, this paper
proposes GEMINUS, a Mixture-of-Experts end-to-end autonomous driving framework
featuring a Global Expert, a Scene-Adaptive Experts Group, and equipped with a
Dual-aware Router. Specifically, the Global Expert is trained on the overall
dataset, possessing robust performance. The Scene-Adaptive Experts are trained
on corresponding scene subsets, achieving adaptive performance. The Dual-aware
Router simultaneously considers scenario-level features and routing uncertainty
to dynamically activate expert modules. Through the effective coupling of the
Global Expert and the Scene-Adaptive Experts Group via the Dual-aware Router,
GEMINUS achieves adaptive and robust performance in diverse scenarios. GEMINUS
outperforms existing methods in the Bench2Drive closed-loop benchmark and
achieves state-of-the-art performance in Driving Score and Success Rate, even
with only monocular vision input. Furthermore, ablation studies demonstrate
significant improvements over the original single-expert baseline: 7.67% in
Driving Score, 22.06% in Success Rate, and 19.41% in MultiAbility-Mean. The
code will be available at https://github.com/newbrains1/GEMINUS.

*Huayuan Ye,Juntong Chen,Shenzhuo Zhang,Yipeng Zhang,Changbo Wang,Chenhui Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VisGuard是一个抗篡改的可视化图像数据检索框架，通过嵌入元数据链接解决现有方法在图像编辑中的脆弱性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在可视化图像传播中容易因裁剪和编辑丢失元数据，VisGuard旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 采用重复数据平铺、可逆信息广播和基于锚点的裁剪定位技术，增强嵌入数据的鲁棒性。

Result: VisGuard在数据检索准确性、嵌入容量和抗篡改安全性方面表现优异。

Conclusion: VisGuard能有效保护和促进可视化图像的传播与信息传递。

Abstract: The dissemination of visualizations is primarily in the form of raster
images, which often results in the loss of critical information such as source
code, interactive features, and metadata. While previous methods have proposed
embedding metadata into images to facilitate Visualization Image Data Retrieval
(VIDR), most existing methods lack practicability since they are fragile to
common image tampering during online distribution such as cropping and editing.
To address this issue, we propose VisGuard, a tamper-resistant VIDR framework
that reliably embeds metadata link into visualization images. The embedded data
link remains recoverable even after substantial tampering upon images. We
propose several techniques to enhance robustness, including repetitive data
tiling, invertible information broadcasting, and an anchor-based scheme for
crop localization. VisGuard enables various applications, including interactive
chart reconstruction, tampering detection, and copyright protection. We conduct
comprehensive experiments on VisGuard's superior performance in data retrieval
accuracy, embedding capacity, and security against tampering and steganalysis,
demonstrating VisGuard's competence in facilitating and safeguarding
visualization dissemination and information conveyance.

### [14] [OptiCorNet: Optimizing Sequence-Based Context Correlation for Visual Place Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14477)
*Zhenyu Li,Tianyi Shang,Pengjie Xu,Ruirui Zhang,Fanchen Kong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OptiCorNet提出了一种新颖的序列建模框架，结合空间特征提取和时间差分，通过端到端训练提升动态环境中的视觉地点识别性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态和感知混淆环境中的视觉地点识别（VPR）是长期定位的核心挑战，现有方法多基于单帧嵌入，忽略了时间连贯性。

Method: OptiCorNet采用轻量级1D卷积编码器和可学习的差分时间算子（DSD），结合LSTM优化和四元组损失函数，直接学习序列级嵌入。

Result: 在多个公开基准测试中，OptiCorNet在季节和视角变化下优于现有方法。

Conclusion: OptiCorNet通过端到端学习序列级嵌入，显著提升了动态环境中的地点识别性能。

Abstract: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) in dynamic and perceptually aliased
environments remains a fundamental challenge for long-term localization.
Existing deep learning-based solutions predominantly focus on single-frame
embeddings, neglecting the temporal coherence present in image sequences. This
paper presents OptiCorNet, a novel sequence modeling framework that unifies
spatial feature extraction and temporal differencing into a differentiable,
end-to-end trainable module. Central to our approach is a lightweight 1D
convolutional encoder combined with a learnable differential temporal operator,
termed Differentiable Sequence Delta (DSD), which jointly captures short-term
spatial context and long-range temporal transitions. The DSD module models
directional differences across sequences via a fixed-weight differencing
kernel, followed by an LSTM-based refinement and optional residual projection,
yielding compact, discriminative descriptors robust to viewpoint and appearance
shifts. To further enhance inter-class separability, we incorporate a
quadruplet loss that optimizes both positive alignment and multi-negative
divergence within each batch. Unlike prior VPR methods that treat temporal
aggregation as post-processing, OptiCorNet learns sequence-level embeddings
directly, enabling more effective end-to-end place recognition. Comprehensive
evaluations on multiple public benchmarks demonstrate that our approach
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines under challenging seasonal and viewpoint
variations.

*Yujia Tong,Jingling Yuan,Tian Zhang,Jianquan Liu,Chuang Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DFQ-ViT提出了一种无需数据的视觉Transformer量化方法，通过优化合成样本质量和引入激活校正矩阵，显著提升了量化模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在合成样本时未能充分平衡全局和局部特征，且量化模型与全精度模型的中间层激活分布差异大，导致性能下降。

Method: 按难度递增顺序合成样本，并在校准和推理阶段引入激活校正矩阵以对齐激活分布。

Result: DFQ-ViT性能优于现有DFQ方法，接近真实数据量化模型，如3位量化DeiT-T性能提升4.29%。

Conclusion: DFQ-ViT无需微调，降低计算开销和部署门槛，符合绿色学习原则，适用于资源受限环境。

Abstract: Data-Free Quantization (DFQ) enables the quantization of Vision Transformers
(ViTs) without requiring access to data, allowing for the deployment of ViTs on
devices with limited resources. In DFQ, the quantization model must be
calibrated using synthetic samples, making the quality of these synthetic
samples crucial. Existing methods fail to fully capture and balance the global
and local features within the samples, resulting in limited synthetic data
quality. Moreover, we have found that during inference, there is a significant
difference in the distributions of intermediate layer activations between the
quantized and full-precision models. These issues lead to a severe performance
degradation of the quantized model. To address these problems, we propose a
pipeline for Data-Free Quantization for Vision Transformers (DFQ-ViT).
Specifically, we synthesize samples in order of increasing difficulty,
effectively enhancing the quality of synthetic data. During the calibration and
inference stage, we introduce the activation correction matrix for the
quantized model to align the intermediate layer activations with those of the
full-precision model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DFQ-ViT achieves
remarkable superiority over existing DFQ methods and its performance is on par
with models quantized through real data. For example, the performance of DeiT-T
with 3-bit weights quantization is 4.29% higher than the state-of-the-art. Our
method eliminates the need for fine-tuning, which not only reduces
computational overhead but also lowers the deployment barriers for edge
devices. This characteristic aligns with the principles of Green Learning by
improving energy efficiency and facilitating real-world applications in
resource-constrained environments.

Motivation: 解决不完整点云补全的挑战，尤其是缺乏典型结构特征时，现有方法局限于特定输入类别的限制。

Abstract: Completing the whole 3D structure based on an incomplete point cloud is a
challenging task, particularly when the residual point cloud lacks typical
structural characteristics. Recent methods based on cross-modal learning
attempt to introduce instance images to aid the structure feature learning.
However, they still focus on each particular input class, limiting their
generation abilities. In this work, we propose a novel retrieval-augmented
point cloud completion framework. The core idea is to incorporate cross-modal
retrieval into completion task to learn structural prior information from
similar reference samples. Specifically, we design a Structural Shared Feature
Encoder (SSFE) to jointly extract cross-modal features and reconstruct
reference features as priors. Benefiting from a dual-channel control gate in
the encoder, relevant structural features in the reference sample are enhanced
and irrelevant information interference is suppressed. In addition, we propose
a Progressive Retrieval-Augmented Generator (PRAG) that employs a hierarchical
feature fusion mechanism to integrate reference prior information with input
features from global to local. Through extensive evaluations on multiple
datasets and real-world scenes, our method shows its effectiveness in
generating fine-grained point clouds, as well as its generalization capability
in handling sparse data and unseen categories.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TCP-LLaVA是一种新型多模态大语言模型架构，通过令牌压缩技术解决病理学全切片图像（WSI）的视觉问答（VQA）问题，显著降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 病理学全切片图像（WSI）的高分辨率和长上下文长度对多模态大语言模型（MLLM）提出了挑战，现有方法资源消耗大且缺乏生成能力。

Method: 提出TCP-LLaVA，通过可训练的压缩令牌聚合视觉和文本信息，仅将压缩后的令牌输入语言模型，减少计算负担。

Result: 在十种TCGA肿瘤亚型的实验中，TCP-LLaVA在VQA准确性上优于现有基线，并大幅降低训练资源消耗。

Conclusion: TCP-LLaVA为WSI的VQA提供了一种高效且资源友好的解决方案。

Abstract: Whole-slide images (WSIs) in pathology can reach up to 10,000 x 10,000
pixels, posing significant challenges for multimodal large language model
(MLLM) due to long context length and high computational demands. Previous
methods typically focus on patch-level analysis or slide-level classification
using CLIP-based models with multi-instance learning, but they lack the
generative capabilities needed for visual question answering (VQA). More recent
MLLM-based approaches address VQA by feeding thousands of patch tokens directly
into the language model, which leads to excessive resource consumption. To
address these limitations, we propose Token Compression Pathology LLaVA
(TCP-LLaVA), the first MLLM architecture to perform WSI VQA via token
compression. TCP-LLaVA introduces a set of trainable compression tokens that
aggregate visual and textual information through a modality compression module,
inspired by the [CLS] token mechanism in BERT. Only the compressed tokens are
forwarded to the LLM for answer generation, significantly reducing input length
and computational cost. Experiments on ten TCGA tumor subtypes show that
TCP-LLaVA outperforms existing MLLM baselines in VQA accuracy while reducing
training resource consumption by a substantial margin.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖光流或深度估计，而神经形态传感器提供稀疏、高时间分辨率的事件数据，需要更高效的方法。

Method: 利用法向流、场景结构和惯性测量的几何约束，通过优化流程进行事件过分割、残差分析分离运动物体，并基于运动相似性和时间一致性进行层次聚类。

Result: 在EVIMO2v2数据集上验证了方法的准确性，尤其在物体边界表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法在实时机器人及导航应用中具有显著潜力。

Abstract: This paper introduces a robust framework for motion segmentation and
egomotion estimation using event-based normal flow, tailored specifically for
neuromorphic vision sensors. In contrast to traditional methods that rely
heavily on optical flow or explicit depth estimation, our approach exploits the
sparse, high-temporal-resolution event data and incorporates geometric
constraints between normal flow, scene structure, and inertial measurements.
The proposed optimization-based pipeline iteratively performs event
over-segmentation, isolates independently moving objects via residual analysis,
and refines segmentations using hierarchical clustering informed by motion
similarity and temporal consistency. Experimental results on the EVIMO2v2
dataset validate that our method achieves accurate segmentation and
translational motion estimation without requiring full optical flow
computation. This approach demonstrates significant advantages at object
boundaries and offers considerable potential for scalable, real-time robotic
and navigation applications.

Radiance Fields (NeRF), etc. We examine key tasks such as pose-free
reconstruction, dynamic 3D reconstruction, and 3D-aware image and video
synthesis, highlighting their applications in digital humans, SLAM, robotics,
and beyond. In addition, we review commonly used datasets with detailed
statistics, along with evaluation protocols for various downstream tasks. We

Conclusion: DCHM无需依赖人工标注，在多视角行人检测中表现出色，为复杂场景提供了新解决方案。

Abstract: Multiview pedestrian detection typically involves two stages: human modeling
and pedestrian localization. Human modeling represents pedestrians in 3D space
by fusing multiview information, making its quality crucial for detection
accuracy. However, existing methods often introduce noise and have low
precision. While some approaches reduce noise by fitting on costly multiview 3D
annotations, they often struggle to generalize across diverse scenes. To
eliminate reliance on human-labeled annotations and accurately model humans, we
propose Depth-Consistent Human Modeling (DCHM), a framework designed for
consistent depth estimation and multiview fusion in global coordinates.
Specifically, our proposed pipeline with superpixel-wise Gaussian Splatting
achieves multiview depth consistency in sparse-view, large-scaled, and crowded
scenarios, producing precise point clouds for pedestrian localization.
Extensive validations demonstrate that our method significantly reduces noise
during human modeling, outperforming previous state-of-the-art baselines.
Additionally, to our knowledge, DCHM is the first to reconstruct pedestrians
and perform multiview segmentation in such a challenging setting. Code is
available on the \href{https://jiahao-ma.github.io/DCHM/}{project page}.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of educational applications, artistic creation, and
AI-generated content (AIGC) technologies has substantially increased practical
requirements for comprehensive Image Aesthetics Assessment (IAA), particularly
demanding methods capable of delivering both quantitative scoring and
professional understanding. Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)-based IAA

Expert-Level Understanding capabilities; (2) ArtiMuse-10K, the first
expert-curated image aesthetic dataset comprising 10,000 images spanning 5 main
categories and 15 subcategories, each annotated by professional experts with
8-dimensional attributes analysis and a holistic score. Both the model and

Abstract: It has always been a rather tough task to communicate with someone possessing
a hearing impairment. One of the most tested ways to establish such a
communication is through the use of sign based languages. However, not many
people are aware of the smaller intricacies involved with sign language. Sign
language recognition using computer vision aims at eliminating the
communication barrier between deaf-mute and ordinary people so that they can
properly communicate with others. Recently the pandemic has left the whole
world shaken up and has transformed the way we communicate. Video meetings have
become essential for everyone, even people with a hearing disability. In recent
studies, it has been found that people with hearing disabilities prefer to sign
over typing during these video calls. In this paper, we are proposing a browser
extension that will automatically translate sign language to subtitles for
everyone else in the video call. The Large-scale dataset which contains more
than 2000 Word-Level ASL videos, which were performed by over 100 signers will

Motivation: 解决情感认知科学中外部情感刺激与人类内部体验关系的建模问题，尤其是探索ANN在个体感知差异中的表现。

Method: 提出一种新颖的感知边界采样方法，生成位于ANN决策边界的面部表情刺激，构建varEmotion数据集，并通过大规模人类行为实验验证。

Result: ANN分类模糊的刺激在人类参与者中引发更高的感知不确定性，且通过行为数据微调ANN后，其预测与人类群体及个体感知模式一致。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了ANN决策边界与人类感知变异性之间的系统性联系，为情感解释的个性化建模提供了新视角。

Abstract: A fundamental challenge in affective cognitive science is to develop models
that accurately capture the relationship between external emotional stimuli and
human internal experiences. While ANNs have demonstrated remarkable accuracy in
facial expression recognition, their ability to model inter-individual
differences in human perception remains underexplored. This study investigates
the phenomenon of high perceptual variability-where individuals exhibit
significant differences in emotion categorization even when viewing the same
stimulus. Inspired by the similarity between ANNs and human perception, we
hypothesize that facial expression samples that are ambiguous for ANN
classifiers also elicit divergent perceptual judgments among human observers.
To examine this hypothesis, we introduce a novel perceptual boundary sampling
method to generate facial expression stimuli that lie along ANN decision
boundaries. These ambiguous samples form the basis of the varEmotion dataset,
constructed through large-scale human behavioral experiments. Our analysis
reveals that these ANN-confusing stimuli also provoke heightened perceptual
uncertainty in human participants, highlighting shared computational principles
in emotion perception. Finally, by fine-tuning ANN representations using
behavioral data, we achieve alignment between ANN predictions and both
group-level and individual-level human perceptual patterns. Our findings
establish a systematic link between ANN decision boundaries and human
perceptual variability, offering new insights into personalized modeling of
emotional interpretation.

Result: 用户研究表明，系统提供了灵活的界面和精确的算法，帮助用户更快识别干扰并拍摄更高质量的照片。

Conclusion: 该系统有效解决了照片杂乱问题，提升了摄影质量和效率。

Abstract: Clutter in photos is a distraction preventing photographers from conveying
the intended emotions or stories to the audience. Photography amateurs
frequently include clutter in their photos due to unconscious negligence or the
lack of experience in creating a decluttered, aesthetically appealing scene for
shooting. We are thus motivated to develop a camera guidance system that
provides solutions and guidance for clutter identification and removal. We
estimate and visualize the contribution of objects to the overall aesthetics
and content of a photo, based on which users can interactively identify
clutter. Suggestions on getting rid of clutter, as well as a tool that removes
cluttered objects computationally, are provided to guide users to deal with
different kinds of clutter and improve their photographic work. Two technical
novelties underpin interactions in our system: a clutter distinguishment
algorithm with aesthetics evaluations for objects and an iterative image
inpainting algorithm based on generative adversarial nets that reconstructs
missing regions of removed objects for high-resolution images. User studies
demonstrate that our system provides flexible interfaces and accurate
algorithms that allow users to better identify distractions and take higher
quality images within less time.

Conclusion: 语言引导的关系表示能有效提升复杂室内场景的理解能力。

Abstract: Understanding 3D scenes goes beyond simply recognizing objects; it requires
reasoning about the spatial and semantic relationships between them. Current 3D
scene-language models often struggle with this relational understanding,
particularly when visual embeddings alone do not adequately convey the roles
and interactions of objects. In this paper, we introduce Descrip3D, a novel and
powerful framework that explicitly encodes the relationships between objects
using natural language. Unlike previous methods that rely only on 2D and 3D
embeddings, Descrip3D enhances each object with a textual description that
captures both its intrinsic attributes and contextual relationships. These
relational cues are incorporated into the model through a dual-level
integration: embedding fusion and prompt-level injection. This allows for
unified reasoning across various tasks such as grounding, captioning, and
question answering, all without the need for task-specific heads or additional
supervision. When evaluated on five benchmark datasets, including ScanRefer,
Multi3DRefer, ScanQA, SQA3D, and Scan2Cap, Descrip3D consistently outperforms
strong baseline models, demonstrating the effectiveness of language-guided
relational representation for understanding complex indoor scenes.

Conclusion: LEAD通过优化对齐和非线性建模，高效解决预训练模型选择问题。

Abstract: The remarkable success of pretrain-then-finetune paradigm has led to a
proliferation of available pre-trained models for vision tasks. This surge
presents a significant challenge in efficiently choosing the most suitable
pre-trained models for downstream tasks. The critical aspect of this challenge
lies in effectively predicting the model transferability by considering the
underlying fine-tuning dynamics. Existing methods often model fine-tuning
dynamics in feature space with linear transformations, which do not precisely
align with the fine-tuning objective and fail to grasp the essential
nonlinearity from optimization. To this end, we present LEAD, a
finetuning-aligned approach based on the network output of logits. LEAD
proposes a theoretical framework to model the optimization process and derives
an ordinary differential equation (ODE) to depict the nonlinear evolution
toward the final logit state. Additionally, we design a class-aware
decomposition method to consider the varying evolution dynamics across classes
and further ensure practical applicability. Integrating the closely aligned
optimization objective and nonlinear modeling capabilities derived from the
differential equation, our method offers a concise solution to effectively
bridge the optimization gap in a single step, bypassing the lengthy fine-tuning
process. The comprehensive experiments on 24 supervised and self-supervised
pre-trained models across 10 downstream datasets demonstrate impressive
performances and showcase its broad adaptability even in low-data scenarios.

Conclusion: 研究结果为实际MRI工作流程中图像转换技术的应用提供了指导，并指出了未来跨模态医学图像合成的方向。

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) enables the acquisition of multiple image
contrasts, such as T1-weighted (T1w) and T2-weighted (T2w) scans, each offering
distinct diagnostic insights. However, acquiring all desired modalities
increases scan time and cost, motivating research into computational methods
for cross-modal synthesis. To address this, recent approaches aim to synthesize
missing MRI contrasts from those already acquired, reducing acquisition time
while preserving diagnostic quality. Image-to-image (I2I) translation provides
a promising framework for this task. In this paper, we present a comprehensive
benchmark of generative models$\unicode{x2013}$specifically, Generative
Adversarial Networks (GANs), diffusion models, and flow matching (FM)
techniques$\unicode{x2013}$for T1w-to-T2w 2D MRI I2I translation. All
frameworks are implemented with comparable settings and evaluated on three
publicly available MRI datasets of healthy adults. Our quantitative and
qualitative analyses show that the GAN-based Pix2Pix model outperforms
diffusion and FM-based methods in terms of structural fidelity, image quality,
and computational efficiency. Consistent with existing literature, these
results suggest that flow-based models are prone to overfitting on small
datasets and simpler tasks, and may require more data to match or surpass GAN
performance. These findings offer practical guidance for deploying I2I
translation techniques in real-world MRI workflows and highlight promising
directions for future research in cross-modal medical image synthesis. Code and
models are publicly available at

Abstract: Medical imaging plays a vital role in early disease diagnosis and monitoring.
Specifically, blood microscopy offers valuable insights into blood cell
morphology and the detection of hematological disorders. In recent years, deep
learning-based automated classification systems have demonstrated high

classifying blood cell images from the publicly available BloodMNIST dataset.
The study primarily focuses on inference time differences, but also
classification performance for different image sizes. The results reveal
variations in performance across frameworks, influenced by factors such as
image resolution and framework-specific optimizations. Classification accuracy
for JAX and PyTorch was comparable to current benchmarks, showcasing the

Conclusion: Exp-Graph在实验室和真实环境中均表现出色，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: Facial expression recognition is crucial for human-computer interaction
applications such as face animation, video surveillance, affective computing,
medical analysis, etc. Since the structure of facial attributes varies with
facial expressions, incorporating structural information into facial attributes
is essential for facial expression recognition. In this paper, we propose
Exp-Graph, a novel framework designed to represent the structural relationships
among facial attributes using graph-based modeling for facial expression
recognition. For facial attributes graph representation, facial landmarks are
used as the graph's vertices. At the same time, the edges are determined based
on the proximity of the facial landmark and the similarity of the local
appearance of the facial attributes encoded using the vision transformer.
Additionally, graph convolutional networks are utilized to capture and
integrate these structural dependencies into the encoding of facial attributes,
thereby enhancing the accuracy of expression recognition. Thus, Exp-Graph
learns from the facial attribute graphs highly expressive semantic
representations. On the other hand, the vision transformer and graph
convolutional blocks help the framework exploit the local and global
dependencies among the facial attributes that are essential for the recognition
of facial expressions. We conducted comprehensive evaluations of the proposed
Exp-Graph model on three benchmark datasets: Oulu-CASIA, eNTERFACE05, and AFEW.
The model achieved recognition accuracies of 98.09\%, 79.01\%, and 56.39\%,
respectively. These results indicate that Exp-Graph maintains strong
generalization capabilities across both controlled laboratory settings and
real-world, unconstrained environments, underscoring its effectiveness for
practical facial expression recognition applications.

TL;DR: 提出DD-SAM2框架，通过Depthwise-Dilated Adapter高效适配SAM2模型，用于医学视频分割与跟踪，减少计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学图像分割方法多为模态特定设计，适应性差，且SAM2模型在医学视频场景中需要大规模数据集微调，计算成本高。

Method: 引入Depthwise-Dilated Adapter（DD-Adapter）增强多尺度特征提取，实现小数据量下的高效微调。

Result: 在TrackRad2025和EchoNet-Dynamic数据集上分别达到Dice分数0.93和0.97。

Conclusion: DD-SAM2为医学视频分割与跟踪提供了一种高效适配方案，代码与模型将开源。

Abstract: Recent advances in medical image segmentation have been driven by deep
learning; however, most existing methods remain limited by modality-specific
designs and exhibit poor adaptability to dynamic medical imaging scenarios. The
Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) and its related variants, which introduce a
streaming memory mechanism for real-time video segmentation, present new
opportunities for prompt-based, generalizable solutions. Nevertheless, adapting
these models to medical video scenarios typically requires large-scale datasets
for retraining or transfer learning, leading to high computational costs and
the risk of catastrophic forgetting. To address these challenges, we propose
DD-SAM2, an efficient adaptation framework for SAM2 that incorporates a
Depthwise-Dilated Adapter (DD-Adapter) to enhance multi-scale feature
extraction with minimal parameter overhead. This design enables effective
fine-tuning of SAM2 on medical videos with limited training data. Unlike
existing adapter-based methods focused solely on static images, DD-SAM2 fully
exploits SAM2's streaming memory for medical video object tracking and
segmentation. Comprehensive evaluations on TrackRad2025 (tumor segmentation)
and EchoNet-Dynamic (left ventricle tracking) datasets demonstrate superior
performance, achieving Dice scores of 0.93 and 0.97, respectively. To the best
of our knowledge, this work provides an initial attempt at systematically
exploring adapter-based SAM2 fine-tuning for medical video segmentation and
tracking. Code, datasets, and models will be publicly available at

Motivation: 生成式AI的进步增加了虚假内容的风险，现有单模态检测方法无法应对跨模态合成内容。

Method: 采用强化学习后训练策略，结合多阶段训练、思维奖励和混合推理。

Result: BusterX++ 在跨模态检测中表现优异，GenBuster++ 基准测试验证了其有效性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: BusterX++ 解决了跨模态合成媒体的检测挑战，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in generative AI have dramatically improved image and video
synthesis capabilities, significantly increasing the risk of misinformation
through sophisticated fake content. In response, detection methods have evolved
from traditional approaches to multimodal large language models (MLLMs),
offering enhanced transparency and interpretability in identifying synthetic
media. However, current detection systems remain fundamentally limited by their
single-modality design. These approaches analyze images or videos separately,
making them ineffective against synthetic content that combines multiple media
formats. To address these challenges, we introduce \textbf{BusterX++}, a novel
framework designed specifically for cross-modal detection and explanation of
synthetic media. Our approach incorporates an advanced reinforcement learning
(RL) post-training strategy that eliminates cold-start. Through Multi-stage
Training, Thinking Reward, and Hybrid Reasoning, BusterX++ achieves stable and
substantial performance improvements. To enable comprehensive evaluation, we
also present \textbf{GenBuster++}, a cross-modal benchmark leveraging
state-of-the-art image and video generation techniques. This benchmark
comprises 4,000 images and video clips, meticulously curated by human experts
using a novel filtering methodology to ensure high quality, diversity, and
real-world applicability. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness
and generalizability of our approach.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于状态空间模型（SSM）的多光谱特征融合框架MS2Fusion，通过双路径参数交互机制解决现有方法在局部互补特征偏好和计算复杂性上的问题，显著提升了多光谱目标检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多光谱特征融合方法过度偏好局部互补特征而忽视跨模态共享语义，且感受野大小与计算复杂性之间存在瓶颈，限制了泛化性能和可扩展性。

Method: MS2Fusion采用双路径参数交互机制：一条路径通过跨模态隐藏状态解码挖掘互补信息，另一路径通过参数共享探索跨模态对齐。两者在SSM框架下联合优化。

Result: 在FLIR、M3FD和LLVIP等主流基准测试中，MS2Fusion显著优于其他多光谱目标检测方法，并在RGB-T语义分割和RGBT显著目标检测任务中表现出色。

Conclusion: MS2Fusion不仅高效且通用，适用于多种多光谱感知任务，展示了其在功能互补和共享语义空间上的优势。

Abstract: Modern multispectral feature fusion for object detection faces two critical
limitations: (1) Excessive preference for local complementary features over
cross-modal shared semantics adversely affects generalization performance; and
(2) The trade-off between the receptive field size and computational complexity
present critical bottlenecks for scalable feature modeling. Addressing these
issues, a novel Multispectral State-Space Feature Fusion framework, dubbed
MS2Fusion, is proposed based on the state space model (SSM), achieving
efficient and effective fusion through a dual-path parametric interaction
mechanism. More specifically, the first cross-parameter interaction branch
inherits the advantage of cross-attention in mining complementary information
with cross-modal hidden state decoding in SSM. The second shared-parameter
branch explores cross-modal alignment with joint embedding to obtain
cross-modal similar semantic features and structures through parameter sharing
in SSM. Finally, these two paths are jointly optimized with SSM for fusing
multispectral features in a unified framework, allowing our MS2Fusion to enjoy
both functional complementarity and shared semantic space. In our extensive
experiments on mainstream benchmarks including FLIR, M3FD and LLVIP, our
MS2Fusion significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art multispectral object
detection methods, evidencing its superiority. Moreover, MS2Fusion is general
and applicable to other multispectral perception tasks. We show that, even
without specific design, MS2Fusion achieves state-of-the-art results on RGB-T
semantic segmentation and RGBT salient object detection, showing its
generality. The source code will be available at
https://github.com/61s61min/MS2Fusion.git.

Abstract: The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into sports officiating
represents a paradigm shift in how decisions are made in competitive
environments. Traditional manual systems, even when supported by Instant Video
Replay (IVR), often suffer from latency, subjectivity, and inconsistent
enforcement, undermining fairness and athlete trust. This paper introduces
FST.ai, a novel AI-powered framework designed to enhance officiating in Sport
Taekwondo, particularly focusing on the complex task of real-time head kick
detection and scoring. Leveraging computer vision, deep learning, and edge
inference, the system automates the identification and classification of key
actions, significantly reducing decision time from minutes to seconds while
improving consistency and transparency. Importantly, the methodology is not
limited to Taekwondo. The underlying framework -- based on pose estimation,
motion classification, and impact analysis -- can be adapted to a wide range of
sports requiring action detection, such as judo, karate, fencing, or even team
sports like football and basketball, where foul recognition or performance
tracking is critical. By addressing one of Taekwondo's most challenging
scenarios -- head kick scoring -- we demonstrate the robustness, scalability,
and sport-agnostic potential of FST.ai to transform officiating standards
across multiple disciplines.

Conclusion: 该框架是首个可扩展、非接触的解决方案，为大规模餐饮环境中的实时浪费监测奠定了基础，并提供了可行的未来研究方向。

Abstract: Quantifying post-consumer food waste in institutional dining settings is
essential for supporting data-driven sustainability strategies. This study
presents a cost-effective computer vision framework that estimates plate-level
food waste by utilizing semantic segmentation of RGB images taken before and
after meal consumption across five Iranian dishes. Four fully supervised models
(U-Net, U-Net++, and their lightweight variants) were trained using a capped
dynamic inverse-frequency loss and AdamW optimizer, then evaluated through a
comprehensive set of metrics, including Pixel Accuracy, Dice, IoU, and a
custom-defined Distributional Pixel Agreement (DPA) metric tailored to the
task. All models achieved satisfying performance, and for each food type, at
least one model approached or surpassed 90% DPA, demonstrating strong alignment
in pixel-wise proportion estimates. Lighter models with reduced parameter
counts offered faster inference, achieving real-time throughput on an NVIDIA T4
GPU. Further analysis showed superior segmentation performance for dry and more
rigid components (e.g., rice and fries), while more complex, fragmented, or
viscous dishes, such as stews, showed reduced performance, specifically
post-consumption. Despite limitations such as reliance on 2D imaging,
constrained food variety, and manual data collection, the proposed framework is
pioneering and represents a scalable, contactless solution for continuous
monitoring of food consumption. This research lays foundational groundwork for
automated, real-time waste tracking systems in large-scale food service
environments and offers actionable insights and outlines feasible future
directions for dining hall management and policymakers aiming to reduce
institutional food waste.

Result: 在公开空间转录组数据集上，Gene-DML实现了最先进的基因表达预测性能。

Conclusion: Gene-DML通过联合建模细粒度和结构级判别，提升了跨模态表征的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Accurately predicting gene expression from histopathology images offers a
scalable and non-invasive approach to molecular profiling, with significant
implications for precision medicine and computational pathology. However,
existing methods often underutilize the cross-modal representation alignment
between histopathology images and gene expression profiles across multiple
representational levels, thereby limiting their prediction performance. To
address this, we propose Gene-DML, a unified framework that structures latent
space through Dual-pathway Multi-Level discrimination to enhance correspondence
between morphological and transcriptional modalities. The multi-scale
instance-level discrimination pathway aligns hierarchical histopathology
representations extracted at local, neighbor, and global levels with gene
expression profiles, capturing scale-aware morphological-transcriptional
relationships. In parallel, the cross-level instance-group discrimination
pathway enforces structural consistency between individual (image/gene)
instances and modality-crossed (gene/image, respectively) groups, strengthening
the alignment across modalities. By jointly modelling fine-grained and
structural-level discrimination, Gene-DML is able to learn robust cross-modal
representations, enhancing both predictive accuracy and generalization across
diverse biological contexts. Extensive experiments on public spatial
transcriptomics datasets demonstrate that Gene-DML achieves state-of-the-art
performance in gene expression prediction. The code and checkpoints will be
released soon.

Conclusion: Docopilot为文档级多模态理解设立了新基准，相关数据和模型已开源。

Abstract: Despite significant progress in multimodal large language models (MLLMs),
their performance on complex, multi-page document comprehension remains
inadequate, largely due to the lack of high-quality, document-level datasets.
While current retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods offer partial
solutions, they suffer from issues, such as fragmented retrieval contexts,
multi-stage error accumulation, and extra time costs of retrieval. In this
work, we present a high-quality document-level dataset, Doc-750K, designed to
support in-depth understanding of multimodal documents. This dataset includes
diverse document structures, extensive cross-page dependencies, and real
question-answer pairs derived from the original documents. Building on the
dataset, we develop a native multimodal model, Docopilot, which can accurately
handle document-level dependencies without relying on RAG. Experiments
demonstrate that Docopilot achieves superior coherence, accuracy, and
efficiency in document understanding tasks and multi-turn interactions, setting
a new baseline for document-level multimodal understanding. Data, code, and

Abstract: Whole slide images (WSIs) are vital in digital pathology, enabling gigapixel
tissue analysis across various pathological tasks. While recent advancements in
multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) allow multi-task WSI analysis through
natural language, they often underperform compared to task-specific models.
Collaborative multi-agent systems have emerged as a promising solution to
balance versatility and accuracy in healthcare, yet their potential remains
underexplored in pathology-specific domains. To address these issues, we
propose WSI-Agents, a novel collaborative multi-agent system for multi-modal
WSI analysis. WSI-Agents integrates specialized functional agents with robust
task allocation and verification mechanisms to enhance both task-specific
accuracy and multi-task versatility through three components: (1) a task
allocation module assigning tasks to expert agents using a model zoo of patch
and WSI level MLLMs, (2) a verification mechanism ensuring accuracy through
internal consistency checks and external validation using pathology knowledge
bases and domain-specific models, and (3) a summary module synthesizing the
final summary with visual interpretation maps. Extensive experiments on
multi-modal WSI benchmarks show WSI-Agents's superiority to current WSI MLLMs
and medical agent frameworks across diverse tasks.

Conclusion: MIPD通过知识蒸馏有效提升了小模型的泛化和零样本能力，为开放词汇接地情境识别任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) exhibit strong zero-shot
abilities but struggle with complex Grounded Situation Recognition (GSR) and
are resource-intensive for edge device deployment. Meanwhile, conventional GSR
models often lack generalization ability, falling short in recognizing unseen
and rare situations. In this paper, we exploit transferring knowledge from a
teacher MLLM to a small GSR model to enhance its generalization and zero-shot
abilities, thereby introducing the task of Open-vocabulary Grounded Situation
Recognition (Ov-GSR). To achieve this, we propose Multimodal Interactive Prompt
Distillation (MIPD), a novel framework that distills enriched multimodal
knowledge from the foundation model, enabling the student Ov-GSR model to
recognize unseen situations and be better aware of rare situations.
Specifically, the MIPD framework first leverages the LLM-based Judgmental
Rationales Generator (JRG) to construct positive and negative glimpse and gaze
rationales enriched with contextual semantic information. The proposed
scene-aware and instance-perception prompts are then introduced to align
rationales with visual information from the MLLM teacher via the
Negative-Guided Multimodal Prompting Alignment (NMPA) module, effectively
capturing holistic and perceptual multimodal knowledge. Finally, the aligned
multimodal knowledge is distilled into the student Ov-GSR model, providing a
stronger foundation for generalization that enhances situation understanding,
bridges the gap between seen and unseen scenarios, and mitigates prediction
bias in rare cases. We evaluate MIPD on the refined Ov-SWiG dataset, achieving
superior performance on seen, rare, and unseen situations, and further
demonstrate improved unseen detection on the HICO-DET dataset.

Abstract: Agricultural parcels serve as basic units for conducting agricultural
practices and applications, which is vital for land ownership registration,
food security assessment, soil erosion monitoring, etc. However, existing
agriculture parcel extraction studies only focus on mid-resolution mapping or
regular plain farmlands while lacking representation of complex terraced
terrains due to the demands of precision agriculture.In this paper, we
introduce a more fine-grained terraced parcel dataset named GTPBD (Global
Terraced Parcel and Boundary Dataset), which is the first fine-grained dataset
covering major worldwide terraced regions with more than 200,000 complex
terraced parcels with manual annotation. GTPBD comprises 47,537 high-resolution
images with three-level labels, including pixel-level boundary labels, mask
labels, and parcel labels. It covers seven major geographic zones in China and
transcontinental climatic regions around the world.Compared to the existing
datasets, the GTPBD dataset brings considerable challenges due to the: (1)
terrain diversity; (2) complex and irregular parcel objects; and (3) multiple
domain styles. Our proposed GTPBD dataset is suitable for four different tasks,
including semantic segmentation, edge detection, terraced parcel extraction,
and unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) tasks.Accordingly, we benchmark the
GTPBD dataset on eight semantic segmentation methods, four edge extraction
methods, three parcel extraction methods, and five UDA methods, along with a
multi-dimensional evaluation framework integrating pixel-level and object-level
metrics. GTPBD fills a critical gap in terraced remote sensing research,
providing a basic infrastructure for fine-grained agricultural terrain analysis
and cross-scenario knowledge transfer.

Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of preventable blindness,
affecting over 100 million people worldwide. In the United States, individuals
from lower-income communities face a higher risk of progressing to advanced
stages before diagnosis, largely due to limited access to screening. Comorbid
conditions further accelerate disease progression. We propose MultiRetNet, a
novel pipeline combining retinal imaging, socioeconomic factors, and
comorbidity profiles to improve DR staging accuracy, integrated with a clinical
deferral system for a clinical human-in-the-loop implementation. We experiment
with three multimodal fusion methods and identify fusion through a fully
connected layer as the most versatile methodology. We synthesize adversarial,
low-quality images and use contrastive learning to train the deferral system,
guiding the model to identify out-of-distribution samples that warrant
clinician review. By maintaining diagnostic accuracy on suboptimal images and
integrating critical health data, our system can improve early detection,
particularly in underserved populations where advanced DR is often first
identified. This approach may reduce healthcare costs, increase early detection
rates, and address disparities in access to care, promoting healthcare equity.

Abstract: Predicting future motion trajectories is a critical capability across domains
such as robotics, autonomous systems, and human activity forecasting, enabling
safer and more intelligent decision-making. This paper proposes a novel,
efficient, and lightweight approach for robot action prediction, offering
significantly reduced computational cost and inference latency compared to
conventional video prediction models. Importantly, it pioneers the adaptation
of the InstructPix2Pix model for forecasting future visual frames in robotic
tasks, extending its utility beyond static image editing. We implement a deep
learning-based visual prediction framework that forecasts what a robot will
observe 100 frames (10 seconds) into the future, given a current image and a
textual instruction. We repurpose and fine-tune the InstructPix2Pix model to
accept both visual and textual inputs, enabling multimodal future frame
prediction. Experiments on the RoboTWin dataset (generated based on real-world
scenarios) demonstrate that our method achieves superior SSIM and PSNR compared
to state-of-the-art baselines in robot action prediction tasks. Unlike
conventional video prediction models that require multiple input frames, heavy
computation, and slow inference latency, our approach only needs a single image
and a text prompt as input. This lightweight design enables faster inference,
reduced GPU demands, and flexible multimodal control, particularly valuable for
applications like robotics and sports motion trajectory analytics, where motion
trajectory precision is prioritized over visual fidelity.

Abstract: Traffic monitoring is crucial for urban mobility, road safety, and
intelligent transportation systems (ITS). Deep learning has advanced
video-based traffic monitoring through video question answering (VideoQA)
models, enabling structured insight extraction from traffic videos. However,
existing VideoQA models struggle with the complexity of real-world traffic

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LeAdQA通过结合因果感知查询优化和细粒度视觉定位，解决了视频问答中的关键帧稀疏和复杂推理问题，实现了SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频问答方法存在任务无关采样和启发式检索的局限性，无法有效捕捉关键事件和因果-时间结构。

Method: 利用LLM优化问题-选项对以消除因果模糊，通过时间定位模型精确检索关键片段，并动态融合视觉-文本线索生成答案。

Result: 在NExT-QA、IntentQA和NExT-GQA数据集上实现了SOTA性能，同时保持计算效率。

Conclusion: LeAdQA通过精准的视觉定位和因果推理，显著提升了复杂视频问答任务的性能。

Abstract: Video Question Answering (VideoQA) requires identifying sparse critical
moments in long videos and reasoning about their causal relationships to answer
semantically complex questions. While recent advances in multimodal learning
have improved alignment and fusion, current approaches remain limited by two
prevalent but fundamentally flawed strategies: (1) task-agnostic sampling
indiscriminately processes all frames, overwhelming key events with irrelevant
content; and (2) heuristic retrieval captures superficial patterns but misses
causal-temporal structures needed for complex reasoning. To address these
challenges, we introduce LeAdQA, an innovative approach that bridges these gaps
through synergizing causal-aware query refinement with fine-grained visual
grounding. Our method first leverages LLMs to reformulate question-option
pairs, resolving causal ambiguities and sharpening temporal focus. These
refined queries subsequently direct a temporal grounding model to precisely
retrieve the most salient segments, complemented by an adaptive fusion
mechanism dynamically integrating the evidence to maximize relevance. The
integrated visual-textual cues are then processed by an MLLM to generate
accurate, contextually-grounded answers. Experiments on NExT-QA, IntentQA, and
NExT-GQA demonstrate that our method's precise visual grounding substantially
enhances the understanding of video-question relationships, achieving
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on complex reasoning tasks while
maintaining computational efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下图像增强对海洋保护至关重要，但现有AI模型存在数据集偏见、高计算成本和缺乏透明度的问题，可能导致误解。

Method: EBA-AI利用CLIP嵌入检测和缓解数据集偏见，并采用自适应处理优化能源效率，减少GPU使用。

Conclusion: EBA-AI在效率、公平性和可解释性方面表现优异，为可持续、偏见感知和高效计算的海洋保护提供了解决方案。

Abstract: Underwater image enhancement is vital for marine conservation, particularly
coral reef monitoring. However, AI-based enhancement models often face dataset
bias, high computational costs, and lack of transparency, leading to potential
misinterpretations. This paper introduces EBA-AI, an ethics-guided bias-aware
AI framework to address these challenges. EBA-AI leverages CLIP embeddings to
detect and mitigate dataset bias, ensuring balanced representation across
varied underwater environments. It also integrates adaptive processing to
optimize energy efficiency, significantly reducing GPU usage while maintaining
competitive enhancement quality. Experiments on LSUI400, Oceanex, and UIEB100
show that while PSNR drops by a controlled 1.0 dB, computational savings enable
real-time feasibility for large-scale marine monitoring. Additionally,
uncertainty estimation and explainability techniques enhance trust in AI-driven
environmental decisions. Comparisons with CycleGAN, FunIEGAN, RAUNENet,
WaterNet, UGAN, PUGAN, and UTUIE validate EBA-AI's effectiveness in balancing
efficiency, fairness, and interpretability in underwater image processing. By
addressing key limitations of AI-driven enhancement, this work contributes to
sustainable, bias-aware, and computationally efficient marine conservation
efforts. For interactive visualizations, animations, source code, and access to

TL;DR: FOCUS框架通过类特定光谱提示和可学习的[SINK]令牌，实现了高效且可靠的高光谱ViT解释性，显著提升了性能和实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高光谱成像（HSI）在多个领域具有强大潜力，但现有方法难以有效解释ViT的注意力机制，且计算成本高昂。

Method: FOCUS引入类特定光谱提示和[SINK]令牌，通过单次前向传播生成稳定的3D显著性图和光谱重要性曲线。

Result: FOCUS提升了波段级IoU 15%，减少注意力崩溃40%，且与专家标注高度一致。

Conclusion: FOCUS以极低参数开销实现了高分辨率ViT解释性，填补了黑盒建模与可信HSI决策之间的空白。

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) captures hundreds of narrow, contiguous
wavelength bands, making it a powerful tool in biology, agriculture, and
environmental monitoring. However, interpreting Vision Transformers (ViTs) in
this setting remains largely unexplored due to two key challenges: (1) existing
saliency methods struggle to capture meaningful spectral cues, often collapsing
attention onto the class token, and (2) full-spectrum ViTs are computationally
prohibitive for interpretability, given the high-dimensional nature of HSI
data. We present FOCUS, the first framework that enables reliable and efficient
spatial-spectral interpretability for frozen ViTs. FOCUS introduces two core
components: class-specific spectral prompts that guide attention toward
semantically meaningful wavelength groups, and a learnable [SINK] token trained
with an attraction loss to absorb noisy or redundant attention. Together, these
designs make it possible to generate stable and interpretable 3D saliency maps
and spectral importance curves in a single forward pass, without any gradient
backpropagation or backbone modification. FOCUS improves band-level IoU by 15
percent, reduces attention collapse by over 40 percent, and produces saliency
results that align closely with expert annotations. With less than 1 percent
parameter overhead, our method makes high-resolution ViT interpretability
practical for real-world hyperspectral applications, bridging a long-standing
gap between black-box modeling and trustworthy HSI decision-making.

TL;DR: 论文提出LASED大规模航空数据集和可操纵CNN，显著提升无人机视觉地点识别的鲁棒性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决航空视觉地点识别中数据集规模小、多样性不足及旋转模糊性问题。

Method: 引入LASED数据集（170,000个地点，约100万张图像）和可操纵CNN处理旋转方差。

Result: LASED训练模型召回率显著提升；可操纵CNN比传统CNN平均提高12%召回率。

Conclusion: 结合大规模数据集和旋转等变网络，显著增强航空视觉地点识别的性能。

Abstract: Visual Place Recognition (vPR) plays a crucial role in Unmanned Aerial
Vehicle (UAV) navigation, enabling robust localization across diverse
environments. Despite significant advancements, aerial vPR faces unique
challenges due to the limited availability of large-scale, high-altitude
datasets, which limits model generalization, along with the inherent rotational
ambiguity in UAV imagery. To address these challenges, we introduce LASED, a
large-scale aerial dataset with approximately one million images,
systematically sampled from 170,000 unique locations throughout Estonia over a
decade, offering extensive geographic and temporal diversity. Its structured
design ensures clear place separation significantly enhancing model training
for aerial scenarios. Furthermore, we propose the integration of steerable
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to explicitly handle rotational variance,
leveraging their inherent rotational equivariance to produce robust,
orientation-invariant feature representations. Our extensive benchmarking
demonstrates that models trained on LASED achieve significantly higher recall
compared to those trained on smaller, less diverse datasets, highlighting the
benefits of extensive geographic coverage and temporal diversity. Moreover,
steerable CNNs effectively address rotational ambiguity inherent in aerial
imagery, consistently outperforming conventional convolutional architectures,
achieving on average 12\% recall improvement over the best-performing
non-steerable network. By combining structured, large-scale datasets with
rotation-equivariant neural networks, our approach significantly enhances model
robustness and generalization for aerial vPR.

*Wenbo Yue,Chang Li,Guoping Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于信息互补的下采样方法HPD，用于解决传统方法在语义分割任务中丢失关键空间信息的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统下采样方法（如最大池化和跨行卷积）在特征聚合、感受野扩展和计算减少方面表现良好，但在语义分割任务中可能导致关键空间信息丢失，影响像素级预测精度。

Method: 提出Hybrid Pooling Downsampling (HPD)，用MinMaxPooling替代传统方法，通过提取局部区域的最大值信息，有效保留图像的明暗对比和细节特征。

Result: 在ACDC和Synapse数据集上的实验表明，HPD在分割性能上优于传统方法，平均DSC系数提高了0.5%。

Conclusion: HPD模块为语义分割任务提供了一种高效解决方案。

Abstract: In convolutional neural networks (CNNs), downsampling operations are crucial
to model performance. Although traditional downsampling methods (such as
maximum pooling and cross-row convolution) perform well in feature aggregation,
receptive field expansion, and computational reduction, they may lead to the
loss of key spatial information in semantic segmentation tasks, thereby
affecting the pixel-by-pixel prediction accuracy.To this end, this study
proposes a downsampling method based on information complementarity - Hybrid
Pooling Downsampling (HPD). The core is to replace the traditional method with
MinMaxPooling, and effectively retain the light and dark contrast and detail
features of the image by extracting the maximum value information of the local
area.Experiment on various CNN architectures on the ACDC and Synapse datasets
show that HPD outperforms traditional methods in segmentation performance, and
increases the DSC coefficient by 0.5% on average. The results show that the HPD
module provides an efficient solution for semantic segmentation tasks.

Abstract: Odometry is a critical task for autonomous systems for self-localization and
navigation. We propose a novel LiDAR-Visual odometry framework that integrates
LiDAR point clouds and images for accurate and robust pose estimation. Our
method utilizes a dense-depth map estimated from point clouds and images
through depth completion, and incorporates a multi-scale feature extraction
network with attention mechanisms, enabling adaptive depth-aware
representations. Furthermore, we leverage dense depth information to refine
flow estimation and mitigate errors in occlusion-prone regions. Our
hierarchical pose refinement module optimizes motion estimation progressively,
ensuring robust predictions against dynamic environments and scale ambiguities.
Comprehensive experiments on the KITTI odometry benchmark demonstrate that our
approach achieves similar or superior accuracy and robustness compared to
state-of-the-art visual and LiDAR odometry methods.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为EPD的新型ODE求解器，通过并行梯度评估减少截断误差，实现高质量低延迟采样。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型因顺序去噪导致高延迟，现有加速方法在低延迟下图像质量下降。

Method: EPD利用并行梯度评估优化ODE求解器，参数可学习且完全并行化。

Result: 在多个图像合成基准上，EPD在5 NFE下FID显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: EPD是一种高效插件式方法，显著提升采样质量和速度。

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have achieved state-of-the-art generative performance
but suffer from high sampling latency due to their sequential denoising nature.
Existing solver-based acceleration methods often face image quality degradation
under a low-latency budget. In this paper, we propose the Ensemble Parallel
Direction solver (dubbed as \ours), a novel ODE solver that mitigates
truncation errors by incorporating multiple parallel gradient evaluations in
each ODE step. Importantly, since the additional gradient computations are
independent, they can be fully parallelized, preserving low-latency sampling.
  Our method optimizes a small set of learnable parameters in a distillation
fashion, ensuring minimal training overhead.
  In addition, our method can serve as a plugin to improve existing ODE
samplers. Extensive experiments on various image synthesis benchmarks
demonstrate the effectiveness of our \ours~in achieving high-quality and
low-latency sampling. For example, at the same latency level of 5 NFE, EPD
achieves an FID of 4.47 on CIFAR-10, 7.97 on FFHQ, 8.17 on ImageNet, and 8.26
on LSUN Bedroom, surpassing existing learning-based solvers by a significant
margin. Codes are available in https://github.com/BeierZhu/EPD.

Result: Being-H0在手部运动生成和指令跟随方面表现优异，并在真实机器人操作中取得预期效果。

Conclusion: 通过人类视频和物理指令调优，Being-H0显著提升了VLA在复杂操作任务中的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: We introduce Being-H0, a dexterous Vision-Language-Action model (VLA) trained
on large-scale human videos. Existing VLAs struggle with complex manipulation
tasks requiring high dexterity and generalize poorly to novel scenarios and
tasks, primarily due to their reliance on synthetic data with significant
sim-to-real gaps or teleoperated demonstrations lacking scale and diversity. To
address this data bottleneck, we propose leveraging human hands as a foundation
manipulator, capitalizing on the rich dexterity and scalability present in web
data. Our approach centers on physical instruction tuning, a novel training
paradigm that combines large-scale VLA pretraining from human videos, physical
space alignment for 3D reasoning, and post-training adaptation for robotic
tasks. Additionally, we introduce a part-level motion tokenization method which
achieves millimeter-level reconstruction accuracy to model precise hand
trajectories for action learning. To support our proposed paradigm, we further
develop a comprehensive data curation pipeline that integrates heterogeneous
sources -- including motion capture, VR, and RGB-only videos -- into a
large-scale dataset with millions of motion-based instructional instances. We
empirically show the excellence of Being-H0 in hand motion generation and
instruction following, and it also scales well with model and data sizes.
Importantly, we observe the expected gains of Being-H0 in real-world robotic
manipulation as physical instruction tuning is applied. More details are

TL;DR: 论文评估了DUSt3R、MASt3R和VGGT模型在稀疏航拍图像上的3D重建能力，结果显示这些方法在稀疏图像集上表现优异，但高分辨率和大规模图像集仍存在挑战。


<details>

Motivation: 探索基于Transformer的3D重建模型在航拍图像上的潜力，填补其在摄影测量领域的研究空白。

Method: 在UseGeo数据集的航拍图像块上评估预训练的DUSt3R、MASt3R和VGGT模型，测试其在姿态估计和密集3D重建中的表现。

Result: 这些方法能从极稀疏图像集（少于10张，分辨率518像素）准确重建密集点云，完整性比COLMAP提升50%，VGGT计算效率更高。

Conclusion: Transformer方法无法完全替代传统SfM和MVS，但在低分辨率、稀疏场景下可作为补充方案。

Abstract: State-of-the-art 3D computer vision algorithms continue to advance in
handling sparse, unordered image sets. Recently developed foundational models
for 3D reconstruction, such as Dense and Unconstrained Stereo 3D Reconstruction
(DUSt3R), Matching and Stereo 3D Reconstruction (MASt3R), and Visual Geometry
Grounded Transformer (VGGT), have attracted attention due to their ability to
handle very sparse image overlaps. Evaluating DUSt3R/MASt3R/VGGT on typical
aerial images matters, as these models may handle extremely low image overlaps,
stereo occlusions, and textureless regions. For redundant collections, they can
accelerate 3D reconstruction by using extremely sparsified image sets. Despite
tests on various computer vision benchmarks, their potential on photogrammetric
aerial blocks remains unexplored. This paper conducts a comprehensive
evaluation of the pre-trained DUSt3R/MASt3R/VGGT models on the aerial blocks of
the UseGeo dataset for pose estimation and dense 3D reconstruction. Results
show these methods can accurately reconstruct dense point clouds from very
sparse image sets (fewer than 10 images, up to 518 pixels resolution), with
completeness gains up to +50% over COLMAP. VGGT also demonstrates higher
computational efficiency, scalability, and more reliable camera pose
estimation. However, all exhibit limitations with high-resolution images and
large sets, as pose reliability declines with more images and geometric
complexity. These findings suggest transformer-based methods cannot fully
replace traditional SfM and MVS, but offer promise as complementary approaches,
especially in challenging, low-resolution, and sparse scenarios.

Abstract: Low-level vision involves a wide spectrum of tasks, including image
restoration, enhancement, stylization, and feature extraction, which differ
significantly in both task formulation and output domains. To address the
challenge of unified modeling across such diverse tasks, we propose a Visual
task Prompt-based Image Processing (VPIP) framework that leverages input-target
image pairs as visual prompts to guide the model in performing a variety of
low-level vision tasks. The framework comprises an end-to-end image processing
backbone, a prompt encoder, and a prompt interaction module, enabling flexible
integration with various architectures and effective utilization of
task-specific visual representations. Based on this design, we develop a
unified low-level vision model, GenLV, and evaluate its performance across
multiple representative tasks. To explore the scalability of this approach, we
extend the framework along two dimensions: model capacity and task diversity.
We construct a large-scale benchmark consisting of over 100 low-level vision
tasks and train multiple versions of the model with varying scales.
Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves considerable
performance across a wide range of tasks. Notably, increasing the number of
training tasks enhances generalization, particularly for tasks with limited
data, indicating the model's ability to learn transferable representations
through joint training. Further evaluations in zero-shot generalization,
few-shot transfer, and task-specific fine-tuning scenarios demonstrate the
model's strong adaptability, confirming the effectiveness, scalability, and
potential of the proposed framework as a unified foundation for general
low-level vision modeling.

Abstract: Multi-face deepfake videos are becoming increasingly prevalent, often
appearing in natural social settings that challenge existing detection methods.
Most current approaches excel at single-face detection but struggle in
multi-face scenarios, due to a lack of awareness of crucial contextual cues. In
this work, we develop a novel approach that leverages human cognition to
analyze and defend against multi-face deepfake videos. Through a series of
human studies, we systematically examine how people detect deepfake faces in
social settings. Our quantitative analysis reveals four key cues humans rely
on: scene-motion coherence, inter-face appearance compatibility, interpersonal
gaze alignment, and face-body consistency. Guided by these insights, we
introduce \textsf{HICOM}, a novel framework designed to detect every fake face
in multi-face scenarios. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that
\textsf{HICOM} improves average accuracy by 3.3\% in in-dataset detection and
2.8\% under real-world perturbations. Moreover, it outperforms existing methods
by 5.8\% on unseen datasets, demonstrating the generalization of human-inspired
cues. \textsf{HICOM} further enhances interpretability by incorporating an LLM
to provide human-readable explanations, making detection results more
transparent and convincing. Our work sheds light on involving human factors to
enhance defense against deepfakes.

Result: SegQuant在多种扩散模型上表现优异，兼容主流部署工具。

Conclusion: SegQuant为扩散模型的高效部署提供了通用解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated exceptional generative capabilities but
are computationally intensive, posing significant challenges for deployment in
resource-constrained or latency-sensitive environments. Quantization offers an
effective means to reduce model size and computational cost, with post-training
quantization (PTQ) being particularly appealing due to its compatibility with
pre-trained models without requiring retraining or training data. However,
existing PTQ methods for diffusion models often rely on architecture-specific
heuristics that limit their generalizability and hinder integration with
industrial deployment pipelines. To address these limitations, we propose
SegQuant, a unified quantization framework that adaptively combines
complementary techniques to enhance cross-model versatility. SegQuant consists
of a segment-aware, graph-based quantization strategy (SegLinear) that captures
structural semantics and spatial heterogeneity, along with a dual-scale
quantization scheme (DualScale) that preserves polarity-asymmetric activations,
which is crucial for maintaining visual fidelity in generated outputs. SegQuant
is broadly applicable beyond Transformer-based diffusion models, achieving
strong performance while ensuring seamless compatibility with mainstream
deployment tools.

introduce FinChart-Bench, the first benchmark specifically focused on
real-world financial charts. FinChart-Bench comprises 1,200 financial chart
images collected from 2015 to 2024, each annotated with True/False (TF),
Multiple Choice (MC), and Question Answering (QA) questions, totaling 7,016
questions. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 25 state-of-the-art LVLMs
on FinChart-Bench. Our evaluation reveals critical insights: (1) the
performance gap between open-source and closed-source models is narrowing, (2)
performance degradation occurs in upgraded models within families, (3) many
models struggle with instruction following, (4) both advanced models show
significant limitations in spatial reasoning abilities, and (5) current LVLMs
are not reliable enough to serve as automated evaluators. These findings

Abstract: Image dehazing aims to remove unwanted hazy artifacts in images. Although
previous research has collected paired real-world hazy and haze-free images to
improve dehazing models' performance in real-world scenarios, these models
often experience significant performance drops when handling unseen real-world
hazy images due to limited training data. This issue motivates us to develop a
flexible domain adaptation method to enhance dehazing performance during
testing. Observing that predicting haze patterns is generally easier than
recovering clean content, we propose the Physics-guided Haze Transfer Network
(PHATNet) which transfers haze patterns from unseen target domains to
source-domain haze-free images, creating domain-specific fine-tuning sets to

enhance PHATNet's disentanglement ability. Experimental results demonstrate
that PHATNet significantly boosts state-of-the-art dehazing models on benchmark

Abstract: The segmentation of mass lesions in digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) images
is very significant for the early screening of breast cancer. However, the
high-density breast tissue often leads to high concealment of the mass lesions,
which makes manual annotation difficult and time-consuming. As a result, there
is a lack of annotated data for model training. Diffusion models are commonly
used for data augmentation, but the existing methods face two challenges.
First, due to the high concealment of lesions, it is difficult for the model to
learn the features of the lesion area. This leads to the low generation quality
of the lesion areas, thus limiting the quality of the generated images. Second,
existing methods can only generate images and cannot generate corresponding
annotations, which restricts the usability of the generated images in
supervised training. In this work, we propose a paired image generation method.
The method does not require external conditions and can achieve the generation
of paired images by training an extra diffusion guider for the conditional
diffusion model. During the experimental phase, we generated paired DBT slices
and mass lesion masks. Then, we incorporated them into the supervised training
process of the mass lesion segmentation task. The experimental results show
that our method can improve the generation quality without external conditions.
Moreover, it contributes to alleviating the shortage of annotated data, thus
enhancing the performance of downstream tasks.

Conclusion: 该方法为深度补全提供了一种更灵活且成本更低的解决方案。

Abstract: Depth completion is an important vision task, and many efforts have been made
to enhance the quality of depth maps from sparse depth measurements. Despite
significant advances, training these models to recover dense depth from sparse
measurements remains a challenging problem. Supervised learning methods rely on
dense depth labels to predict unobserved regions, while self-supervised
approaches require image sequences to enforce geometric constraints and
photometric consistency between frames. However, acquiring dense annotations is
costly, and multi-frame dependencies limit the applicability of self-supervised
methods in static or single-frame scenarios. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel self-supervised depth completion paradigm that requires only
sparse depth measurements and their corresponding image for training. Unlike
existing methods, our approach eliminates the need for dense depth labels or
additional images captured from neighboring viewpoints. By leveraging the
characteristics of depth distribution, we design novel loss functions that
effectively propagate depth information from observed points to unobserved
regions. Additionally, we incorporate segmentation maps generated by vision
foundation models to further enhance depth estimation. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.

Abstract: In this work, we propose an all-in-one video restoration framework that

and learns an approximation to the grounded knowledge such that the foundation
model can be safely disentangled during inference adding no extra cost.
Further, we call for standardization of benchmarks in all-in-one video
restoration, and propose two benchmarks in multi-degradation setting,
three-task (3D) and four-task (4D), and two time-varying composite degradation
benchmarks; one of the latter being our proposed dataset with varying snow
intensity, simulating how weather degradations affect videos naturally. We
compare our method with prior works and report state-of-the-art performance on

Abstract: This paper investigates the problem of object detection with a focus on
improving both the localization accuracy of bounding boxes and explicitly
modeling prediction uncertainty. Conventional detectors rely on deterministic
bounding box regression, ignoring uncertainty in predictions and limiting model
robustness. In this paper, we propose an uncertainty-aware enhancement
framework for DETR-based object detectors. We model bounding boxes as
multivariate Gaussian distributions and incorporate the Gromov-Wasserstein
distance into the loss function to better align the predicted and ground-truth
distributions. Building on this, we derive a Bayes Risk formulation to filter
high-risk information and improve detection reliability. We also propose a
simple algorithm to quantify localization uncertainty via confidence intervals.
Experiments on the COCO benchmark show that our method can be effectively
integrated into existing DETR variants, enhancing their performance. We further
extend our framework to leukocyte detection tasks, achieving state-of-the-art
results on the LISC and WBCDD datasets. These results confirm the scalability
of our framework across both general and domain-specific detection tasks. Code

Abstract: Micro-gestures are unconsciously performed body gestures that can convey the
emotion states of humans and start to attract more research attention in the
fields of human behavior understanding and affective computing as an emerging
topic. However, the modeling of human emotion based on micro-gestures has not
been explored sufficiently. In this work, we propose to recognize the emotion
states based on the micro-gestures by reconstructing the behavior patterns with
a hypergraph-enhanced Transformer in a hybrid-supervised framework. In the
framework, hypergraph Transformer based encoder and decoder are separately
designed by stacking the hypergraph-enhanced self-attention and multiscale
temporal convolution modules. Especially, to better capture the subtle motion
of micro-gestures, we construct a decoder with additional upsampling operations
for a reconstruction task in a self-supervised learning manner. We further
propose a hypergraph-enhanced self-attention module where the hyperedges
between skeleton joints are gradually updated to present the relationships of
body joints for modeling the subtle local motion. Lastly, for exploiting the
relationship between the emotion states and local motion of micro-gestures, an
emotion recognition head from the output of encoder is designed with a shallow
architecture and learned in a supervised way. The end-to-end framework is
jointly trained in a one-stage way by comprehensively utilizing
self-reconstruction and supervision information. The proposed method is
evaluated on two publicly available datasets, namely iMiGUE and SMG, and
achieves the best performance under multiple metrics, which is superior to the
existing methods.

Abstract: In recent years, the emergence of foundation models for depth prediction has
led to remarkable progress, particularly in zero-shot monocular depth
estimation. These models generate impressive depth predictions; however, their
outputs are often in relative scale rather than metric scale. This limitation
poses challenges for direct deployment in real-world applications. To address
this, several scale adaptation methods have been proposed to enable foundation
models to produce metric depth. However, these methods are typically costly, as
they require additional training on new domains and datasets. Moreover,
fine-tuning these models often compromises their original generalization
capabilities, limiting their adaptability across diverse scenes. In this paper,
we introduce a non-learning-based approach that leverages sparse depth
measurements to adapt the relative-scale predictions of foundation models into
metric-scale depth. Our method requires neither retraining nor fine-tuning,
thereby preserving the strong generalization ability of the original foundation
models while enabling them to produce metric depth. Experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, high-lighting its potential to
bridge the gap between relative and metric depth without incurring additional
computational costs or sacrificing generalization ability.

Conclusion: BeatFormer通过结合手工方法和深度学习的优势，提供了一种高效且泛化能力强的rPPG估计方法。

Abstract: Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) captures cardiac signals from facial
videos and is gaining attention for its diverse applications. While deep
learning has advanced rPPG estimation, it relies on large, diverse datasets for
effective generalization. In contrast, handcrafted methods utilize
physiological priors for better generalization in unseen scenarios like motion
while maintaining computational efficiency. However, their linear assumptions
limit performance in complex conditions, where deep learning provides superior
pulsatile information extraction. This highlights the need for hybrid
approaches that combine the strengths of both methods. To address this, we
present BeatFormer, a lightweight spectral attention model for rPPG estimation,
which integrates zoomed orthonormal complex attention and frequency-domain
energy measurement, enabling a highly efficient model. Additionally, we
introduce Spectral Contrastive Learning (SCL), which allows BeatFormer to be
trained without any PPG or HR labels. We validate BeatFormer on the PURE,
UBFC-rPPG, and MMPD datasets, demonstrating its robustness and performance,
particularly in cross-dataset evaluations under motion scenarios.

Abstract: 3D visual grounding allows an embodied agent to understand visual information
in real-world 3D environments based on human instructions, which is crucial for
embodied intelligence. Existing 3D visual grounding methods typically rely on
separate encoders for different modalities (e.g., RGB images, text, and 3D
point clouds), resulting in large and complex models that are inefficient to
train. While some approaches use pre-trained 2D multi-modal models like CLIP
for 3D tasks, they still struggle with aligning point cloud data to 2D
encoders. As a result, these methods continue to depend on 3D encoders for
feature extraction, further increasing model complexity and training
inefficiency. In this paper, we propose a unified 2D pre-trained multi-modal
network to process all three modalities (RGB images, text, and point clouds),
significantly simplifying the architecture. By leveraging a 2D CLIP bi-modal
model with adapter-based fine-tuning, this framework effectively adapts to the
tri-modal setting, improving both adaptability and performance across
modalities. Our Geometric-Aware 2D-3D Feature Recovery and Fusion (GARF) module
is designed to fuse geometric multi-scale features from point clouds and
images. We then integrate textual features for final modality fusion and
introduce a multi-modal decoder to facilitate deep cross-modal understanding.
Together, our method achieves unified feature extraction and fusion across the
three modalities, enabling an end-to-end 3D visual grounding model. Compared to
the baseline, our method reduces the number of trainable parameters by
approximately 58\%, while achieving a 6.52\% improvement in the 3D detection
task and a 6.25\% improvement in the 3D visual grounding task.

Conclusion: SARL通过语义对齐和区域聚合提升了多标签图像分类的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Multi-label image classification, an important research area in computer
vision, focuses on identifying multiple labels or concepts within an image.
Existing approaches often employ attention mechanisms or graph convolutional
networks (GCNs) to learn image representation. However, this representation may
contain noise and may not locate objects precisely. Therefore, this paper
proposes a Semantic-Aware Representation Learning (SARL) for multi-label image
classification. First, a label semantic-related feature learning module is
utilized to extract semantic-related features. Then, an optimal transport-based
attention mechanism is designed to obtain semantically aligned image
representation. Finally, a regional score aggregation strategy is used for
multi-label prediction. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets, PASCAL
VOC 2007 and MS-COCO, demonstrate the superiority of SARL over existing
methods.

Conclusion: \method为实际3D内容生成提供了高效、可扩展的解决方案，平衡了资源消耗与输出质量。

Abstract: Generalizable 3D Gaussian Splatting reconstruction showcases advanced
Image-to-3D content creation but requires substantial computational resources
and large datasets, posing challenges to training models from scratch. Current
methods usually entangle the prediction of 3D Gaussian geometry and appearance,
which rely heavily on data-driven priors and result in slow regression speeds.
To address this, we propose \method, a disentangled framework for efficient 3D
Gaussian prediction. Our method extracts features from local image pairs using
a stereo vision backbone and fuses them via global attention blocks. Dedicated
point and Gaussian prediction heads generate multi-view point-maps for geometry
and Gaussian features for appearance, combined as GS-maps to represent the 3DGS
object. A refinement network enhances these GS-maps for high-quality
reconstruction. Unlike existing methods that depend on camera parameters, our
approach achieves pose-free 3D reconstruction, improving robustness and
practicality. By reducing resource demands while maintaining high-quality
outputs, \method provides an efficient, scalable solution for real-world 3D
content generation.

Motivation: 低温电子显微镜（cryo-EM）中由于极低信噪比（SNR），姿态估计和位移校正是关键挑战，直接影响3D重建的准确性。

Conclusion: 提出的方法通过鲁棒优化和全局约束，显著提升了低SNR条件下的姿态估计和3D重建质量。

Abstract: Accurate pose estimation and shift correction are key challenges in cryo-EM
due to the very low SNR, which directly impacts the fidelity of 3D
reconstructions. We present an approach for pose estimation in cryo-EM that
leverages multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) techniques in a robust manner to
estimate the 3D rotation matrix of each particle from pairs of dihedral angles.
We express the rotation matrix in the form of an axis of rotation and a unit
vector in the plane perpendicular to the axis. The technique leverages the
concept of common lines in 3D reconstruction from projections. However, common
line estimation is ridden with large errors due to the very low SNR of cryo-EM
projection images. To address this challenge, we introduce two complementary
components: (i) a robust joint optimization framework for pose estimation based
on an $\ell_1$-norm objective or a similar robust norm, which simultaneously
estimates rotation axes and in-plane vectors while exactly enforcing unit norm
and orthogonality constraints via projected coordinate descent; and (ii) an
iterative shift correction algorithm that estimates consistent in-plane
translations through a global least-squares formulation. While prior approaches
have leveraged such embeddings and common-line geometry for orientation
recovery, existing formulations typically rely on $\ell_2$-based objectives
that are sensitive to noise, and enforce geometric constraints only
approximately. These choices, combined with a sequential pipeline structure,
can lead to compounding errors and suboptimal reconstructions in low-SNR
regimes. Our pipeline consistently outperforms prior methods in both Euler
angle accuracy and reconstruction fidelity, as measured by the Fourier Shell
Correlation (FSC).

Abstract: The Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) paradigm is attracting plenty of
attention in medical imaging classification, where labeled data is scarce. MIL
methods cast medical images as bags of instances (e.g. patches in whole slide
images, or slices in CT scans), and only bag labels are required for training.
Deep MIL approaches have obtained promising results by aggregating
instance-level representations via an attention mechanism to compute the
bag-level prediction. These methods typically capture both local interactions
among adjacent instances and global, long-range dependencies through various
mechanisms. However, they treat attention values deterministically, potentially
overlooking uncertainty in the contribution of individual instances. In this
work we propose a novel probabilistic framework that estimates a probability
distribution over the attention values, and accounts for both global and local
interactions. In a comprehensive evaluation involving {\color{review} eleven}
state-of-the-art baselines and three medical datasets, we show that our
approach achieves top predictive performance in different metrics. Moreover,
the probabilistic treatment of the attention provides uncertainty maps that are
interpretable in terms of illness localization.

Abstract: This paper extends Cross Modal Generalization (CMG) to open-set environments
by proposing the more challenging Open-set Cross Modal Generalization (OSCMG)
task. This task evaluates multimodal unified representations in open-set
conditions, addressing the limitations of prior closed-set cross-modal
evaluations. OSCMG requires not only cross-modal knowledge transfer but also
robust generalization to unseen classes within new modalities, a scenario
frequently encountered in real-world applications. Existing multimodal unified
representation work lacks consideration for open-set environments. To tackle
this, we propose MICU, comprising two key components: Fine-Coarse Masked
multimodal InfoNCE (FCMI) and Cross modal Unified Jigsaw Puzzles (CUJP). FCMI
enhances multimodal alignment by applying contrastive learning at both holistic
semantic and temporal levels, incorporating masking to enhance generalization.
CUJP enhances feature diversity and model uncertainty by integrating
modality-agnostic feature selection with self-supervised learning, thereby
strengthening the model's ability to handle unknown categories in open-set
tasks. Extensive experiments on CMG and the newly proposed OSCMG validate the
effectiveness of our approach. The code is available at

Conclusion: Polymorph通过模块化策略显著提升嵌入式设备上的视频分类效率，同时开源供社区使用。

Abstract: Real-time multi-label video classification on embedded devices is constrained
by limited compute and energy budgets. Yet, video streams exhibit structural
properties such as label sparsity, temporal continuity, and label co-occurrence
that can be leveraged for more efficient inference. We introduce Polymorph, a
context-aware framework that activates a minimal set of lightweight Low Rank
Adapters (LoRA) per frame. Each adapter specializes in a subset of classes
derived from co-occurrence patterns and is implemented as a LoRA weight over a
shared backbone. At runtime, Polymorph dynamically selects and composes only
the adapters needed to cover the active labels, avoiding full-model switching
and weight merging. This modular strategy improves scalability while reducing
latency and energy overhead. Polymorph achieves 40% lower energy consumption
and improves mAP by 9 points over strong baselines on the TAO dataset.

PCR task as the fundamental problem. To address this Decision PCR task, we
propose a data-driven approach. First, we construct a corresponding dataset
based on the 3DMatch dataset. Then, a deep learning-based classifier is trained
to reliably assess registration quality, overcoming the limitations of
traditional metrics. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive study to
address this task through a deep learning framework. We incorporate this
classifier into standard PCR pipelines. When integrated with our approach,
existing state-of-the-art PCR methods exhibit significantly enhanced
registration performance. For example, combining our framework with
GeoTransformer achieves a new SOTA registration recall of 86.97\% on the
challenging 3DLoMatch benchmark. Our method also demonstrates strong
generalization capabilities on the unseen outdoor ETH dataset.

TL;DR: HiCroPL提出了一种分层跨模态提示学习框架，通过双向知识流提升视觉语言模型的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 适应大规模视觉语言模型（如CLIP）到下游任务时，保持其泛化能力仍具挑战性。现有提示学习方法存在模态隔离和层次语义衰减问题。

Method: HiCroPL通过分层知识映射器和轻量级层特定知识代理，实现文本和视觉模态的双向知识流，增强语义对齐。

Result: 在四个任务和11个基准测试中，HiCroPL表现优异，达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: HiCroPL通过分层跨模态交互有效解决了现有方法的局限性，显著提升了模型的泛化能力。

Abstract: Pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as CLIP have shown excellent
generalization abilities. However, adapting these large-scale models to
downstream tasks while preserving their generalization capabilities remains
challenging. Although prompt learning methods have shown promise, they suffer
from two fundamental bottlenecks that limit generalization: (a) modality
isolation, and (b) hierarchical semantic decay. To address these limitations,
we propose HiCroPL, a Hierarchical Cross-modal Prompt Learning framework that
establishes bidirectional knowledge flow between text and vision modalities,
enabling them to refine their semantics mutually. HiCroPL routes knowledge
flows by leveraging the complementary strengths of text and vision. In early
layers, text prompts inject relatively clear semantics into visual prompts
through a hierarchical knowledge mapper, enhancing the representation of
low-level visual semantics. In later layers, visual prompts encoding specific
task-relevant objects flow back to refine text prompts, enabling deeper
alignment. Crucially, our hierarchical knowledge mapper allows representations
at multi-scales to be fused, ensuring that deeper representations retain
transferable shallow semantics thereby enhancing generalization. We further
introduce a lightweight layer-specific knowledge proxy to enable efficient
cross-modal interactions. Extensive evaluations across four tasks demonstrate
HiCroPL's superior performance, achieving state-of-the-art results on 11
benchmarks with significant improvements. Code is available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出RvTC方法，通过灵活的基于分箱的分类替代预设词汇分类，无需复杂分布建模即可提升性能。同时，数据特定提示显著优于通用提示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在图像回归任务中表现有限，预设词汇和通用提示未能利用文本输入的语义理解。

Method: 提出Regression via Transformer-Based Classification (RvTC)，采用分箱方法替代预设词汇分类，并通过数据特定提示提升性能。

Result: 在四个图像评估数据集上达到最优性能，AVA数据集中提示加入挑战标题将相关性从0.83提升至0.90。

Conclusion: 语义提示信息对MLLMs至关重要，强调了在多模态回归任务中融入有意义文本上下文的重要性。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show promise for image-based
regression tasks, but current approaches face key limitations. Recent methods
fine-tune MLLMs using preset output vocabularies and generic task-level prompts
(e.g., "How would you rate this image?"), assuming this mimics human rating
behavior. Our analysis reveals these approaches provide no benefit over
image-only training. Models using preset vocabularies and generic prompts
perform equivalently to image-only models, failing to leverage semantic
understanding from textual input. We propose Regression via Transformer-Based
Classification (RvTC), which replaces vocabulary-constrained classification
with a flexible bin-based approach. Unlike approaches that address
discretization errors through complex distributional modeling, RvTC eliminates
manual vocabulary crafting through straightforward bin increase, achieving
state-of-the-art performance on four image assessment datasets using only
images. More importantly, we demonstrate that data-specific prompts
dramatically improve performance. Unlike generic task descriptions, prompts
containing semantic information about specific images enable MLLMs to leverage
cross-modal understanding. On the AVA dataset, adding challenge titles to
prompts improves correlations from 0.83 to 0.90, a new state-of-the-art. We
demonstrate through empirical evidence from the AVA and AGIQA-3k datasets that
MLLMs benefit from semantic prompt information surpassing mere statistical
biases. This underscores the importance of incorporating meaningful textual
context in multimodal regression tasks.

Motivation: 现有基于学习的方法依赖标注数据，未充分利用文档的几何特性。

Method: 在训练阶段引入轴对齐几何约束，推理阶段采用轴对齐预处理策略。

Result: 在多个基准测试中达到SOTA，AAD指标提升18.2%~34.5%。

Conclusion: 轴对齐几何约束和预处理策略有效提升了文档去扭曲的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Document dewarping is crucial for many applications. However, existing
learning-based methods primarily rely on supervised regression with annotated
data without leveraging the inherent geometric properties in physical documents
to the dewarping process. Our key insight is that a well-dewarped document is
characterized by transforming distorted feature lines into axis-aligned ones.
This property aligns with the inherent axis-aligned nature of the discrete grid
geometry in planar documents. In the training phase, we propose an axis-aligned
geometric constraint to enhance document dewarping. In the inference phase, we
propose an axis alignment preprocessing strategy to reduce the dewarping
difficulty. In the evaluation phase, we introduce a new metric, Axis-Aligned
Distortion (AAD), that not only incorporates geometric meaning and aligns with
human visual perception but also demonstrates greater robustness. As a result,
our method achieves SOTA results on multiple existing benchmarks and achieves
18.2%~34.5% improvements on the AAD metric.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于B-Spline曲线拟合的优化方法，用于改进FastSAM中的锯齿边缘问题，提升分割精度并保持实时处理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FastSAM虽然实现了实时分割，但其生成的锯齿边缘偏离真实物体形状，影响了视觉质量和分析准确性。

Method: 采用四阶段优化流程，结合两轮B-Spline曲线拟合，平滑锯齿边缘，同时保留关键几何信息。

Result: 显著提升了边缘的视觉质量和分析准确性，同时保持了FastSAM的实时处理能力。

Conclusion: 该方法增强了FastSAM的实用性，使其在工业自动化、医疗成像和自主系统等场景中更具潜力。

Abstract: Accurately identifying and representing object edges is a challenging task in
computer vision and image processing. The Segment Anything Model (SAM) has
significantly influenced the field of image segmentation, but suffers from high
memory consumption and long inference times, limiting its efficiency in
real-time applications. To address these limitations, Fast Segment Anything
(FastSAM) was proposed, achieving real-time segmentation. However, FastSAM
often generates jagged edges that deviate from the true object shapes.
Therefore, this paper introduces a novel refinement approach using B-Spline
curve fitting techniques to enhance the edge quality in FastSAM. Leveraging the
robust shape control and flexible geometric construction of B-Splines, a
four-stage refining process involving two rounds of curve fitting is employed
to effectively smooth jagged edges. This approach significantly improves the
visual quality and analytical accuracy of object edges without compromising
critical geometric information. The proposed method improves the practical
utility of FastSAM by improving segmentation accuracy while maintaining
real-time processing capabilities. This advancement unlocks greater potential
for FastSAM technology in various real-world scenarios, such as industrial
automation, medical imaging, and autonomous systems, where precise and
efficient edge recognition is crucial.

Result: 评估显示视频大语言模型在理解和对抗性问题上的表现显著落后于人类。

Conclusion: Video-TT揭示了视频大语言模型在复杂视觉叙事理解上的不足，需进一步改进。

Abstract: Human intelligence requires correctness and robustness, with the former being
foundational for the latter. In video understanding, correctness ensures the
accurate interpretation of visual content, and robustness maintains consistent
performance in challenging conditions. Despite advances in video large language
models (video LLMs), existing benchmarks inadequately reflect the gap between
these models and human intelligence in maintaining correctness and robustness
in video interpretation. We introduce the Video Thinking Test (Video-TT), to
assess if video LLMs can interpret real-world videos as effectively as humans.
Video-TT reflects genuine gaps in understanding complex visual narratives, and
evaluates robustness against natural adversarial questions. Video-TT comprises
1,000 YouTube Shorts videos, each with one open-ended question and four
adversarial questions that probe visual and narrative complexity. Our
evaluation shows a significant gap between video LLMs and human performance.

Result: 首次实现神经算子求解器在人体乳房活体成像中的高效应用。

Conclusion: OpenBreastUS为开发创新神经PDE求解器提供了平台，并推动其在真实医学影像中的应用。

Abstract: Accurate and efficient simulation of wave equations is crucial in
computational wave imaging applications, such as ultrasound computed tomography
(USCT), which reconstructs tissue material properties from observed scattered
waves. Traditional numerical solvers for wave equations are computationally
intensive and often unstable, limiting their practical applications for
quasi-real-time image reconstruction. Neural operators offer an innovative
approach by accelerating PDE solving using neural networks; however, their
effectiveness in realistic imaging is limited because existing datasets
oversimplify real-world complexity. In this paper, we present OpenBreastUS, a
large-scale wave equation dataset designed to bridge the gap between
theoretical equations and practical imaging applications. OpenBreastUS includes
8,000 anatomically realistic human breast phantoms and over 16 million
frequency-domain wave simulations using real USCT configurations. It enables a
comprehensive benchmarking of popular neural operators for both forward
simulation and inverse imaging tasks, allowing analysis of their performance,
scalability, and generalization capabilities. By offering a realistic and
extensive dataset, OpenBreastUS not only serves as a platform for developing
innovative neural PDE solvers but also facilitates their deployment in
real-world medical imaging problems. For the first time, we demonstrate
efficient in vivo imaging of the human breast using neural operator solvers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有虚拟试衣技术难以同时满足高保真和跨域适应性，需要一个统一的解决方案。

Method: 提出服装先验生成机制和连续边界缝合技术以保留细节，利用DDIM反演实现精确姿势对齐。

Result: 实验表明OmniVTON在多样化数据集和场景中表现优异，首次实现多人物虚拟试衣。

Conclusion: OmniVTON通过解耦条件，解决了扩散模型的多条件偏差问题，成为首个跨场景通用框架。

Abstract: Image-based Virtual Try-On (VTON) techniques rely on either supervised
in-shop approaches, which ensure high fidelity but struggle with cross-domain
generalization, or unsupervised in-the-wild methods, which improve adaptability
but remain constrained by data biases and limited universality. A unified,
training-free solution that works across both scenarios remains an open
challenge. We propose OmniVTON, the first training-free universal VTON
framework that decouples garment and pose conditioning to achieve both texture
fidelity and pose consistency across diverse settings. To preserve garment
details, we introduce a garment prior generation mechanism that aligns clothing
with the body, followed by continuous boundary stitching technique to achieve
fine-grained texture retention. For precise pose alignment, we utilize DDIM
inversion to capture structural cues while suppressing texture interference,
ensuring accurate body alignment independent of the original image textures. By
disentangling garment and pose constraints, OmniVTON eliminates the bias
inherent in diffusion models when handling multiple conditions simultaneously.
Experimental results demonstrate that OmniVTON achieves superior performance
across diverse datasets, garment types, and application scenarios. Notably, it
is the first framework capable of multi-human VTON, enabling realistic garment
transfer across multiple individuals in a single scene. Code is available at

Motivation: 挑战当前全色锐化领域大模型计算开销高、泛化能力差的问题，提出高效且通用的解决方案。

Method: 设计轻量级单步框架PanTiny，采用多数据集联合训练策略和复合损失函数。

Result: PanTiny在性能和效率上优于大型专用模型，显著提升全分辨率数据的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 通过模型设计、训练范式和损失函数的优化，证明了轻量高效模型在全色锐化中的潜力。

Abstract: The field of pan-sharpening has recently seen a trend towards increasingly
large and complex models, often trained on single, specific satellite datasets.
This approach, however, leads to high computational overhead and poor
generalization on full resolution data, a paradigm we challenge in this paper.
In response to this issue, we propose PanTiny, a lightweight, single-step
pan-sharpening framework designed for both efficiency and robust performance.
More critically, we introduce multiple-in-one training paradigm, where a
single, compact model is trained simultaneously on three distinct satellite
datasets (WV2, WV3, and GF2) with different resolution and spectral
information. Our experiments show that this unified training strategy not only
simplifies deployment but also significantly boosts generalization on
full-resolution data. Further, we introduce a universally powerful composite
loss function that elevates the performance of almost all of models for
pan-sharpening, pushing state-of-the-art metrics into a new era. Our PanTiny
model, benefiting from these innovations, achieves a superior
performance-to-efficiency balance, outperforming most larger, specialized
models. Through extensive ablation studies, we validate that principled
engineering in model design, training paradigms, and loss functions can surpass
brute-force scaling. Our work advocates for a community-wide shift towards
creating efficient, generalizable, and data-conscious models for
pan-sharpening. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的人体图像动画扩散模型在参考图像和驱动视频差异较大时难以保持身份一致性，因此需要一种无需后处理的高质量视频生成方法。

Method: StableAnimator++ 通过学习层预测相似变换矩阵对齐姿态，结合图像和面部嵌入编码器，并通过分布感知的 ID 适配器保持身份。推理阶段采用 HJB 优化的面部优化方法。

Result: 实验表明，StableAnimator++ 在定性和定量上均表现出色，能够有效保持身份一致性并生成高质量视频。

Conclusion: StableAnimator++ 通过创新的姿态对齐和身份保持技术，显著提升了人体图像动画的质量和一致性。

Abstract: Current diffusion models for human image animation often struggle to maintain
identity (ID) consistency, especially when the reference image and driving
video differ significantly in body size or position. We introduce
StableAnimator++, the first ID-preserving video diffusion framework with
learnable pose alignment, capable of generating high-quality videos conditioned
on a reference image and a pose sequence without any post-processing. Building
upon a video diffusion model, StableAnimator++ contains carefully designed
modules for both training and inference, striving for identity consistency. In
particular, StableAnimator++ first uses learnable layers to predict the
similarity transformation matrices between the reference image and the driven
poses via injecting guidance from Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). These
matrices align the driven poses with the reference image, mitigating
misalignment to a great extent. StableAnimator++ then computes image and face
embeddings using off-the-shelf encoders, refining the face embeddings via a
global content-aware Face Encoder. To further maintain ID, we introduce a
distribution-aware ID Adapter that counteracts interference caused by temporal
layers while preserving ID via distribution alignment. During the inference
stage, we propose a novel Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) based face optimization
integrated into the denoising process, guiding the diffusion trajectory for
enhanced facial fidelity. Experiments on benchmarks show the effectiveness of
StableAnimator++ both qualitatively and quantitatively.

Result: 研究发现当前生成模型在OCR任务中存在弱点，并提出了改进建议。

Conclusion: 结论是将逼真文本图像生成和编辑作为通用生成模型的基础技能，而非依赖专用解决方案。

Abstract: Text image is a unique and crucial information medium that integrates visual
aesthetics and linguistic semantics in modern e-society. Due to their subtlety
and complexity, the generation of text images represents a challenging and
evolving frontier in the image generation field. The recent surge of
specialized image generators (\emph{e.g.}, Flux-series) and unified generative
models (\emph{e.g.}, GPT-4o), which demonstrate exceptional fidelity, raises a
natural question: can they master the intricacies of text image generation and
editing? Motivated by this, we assess current state-of-the-art generative
models' capabilities in terms of text image generation and editing. We
incorporate various typical optical character recognition (OCR) tasks into our
evaluation and broaden the concept of text-based generation tasks into OCR
generative tasks. We select 33 representative tasks and categorize them into
five categories: document, handwritten text, scene text, artistic text, and
complex \& layout-rich text. For comprehensive evaluation, we examine six
models across both closed-source and open-source domains, using tailored,
high-quality image inputs and prompts. Through this evaluation, we draw crucial
observations and identify the weaknesses of current generative models for OCR
tasks. We argue that photorealistic text image generation and editing should be
internalized as foundational skills into general-domain generative models,
rather than being delegated to specialized solutions, and we hope this
empirical analysis can provide valuable insights for the community to achieve
this goal. This evaluation is online and will be continuously updated at our
GitHub repository.

Motivation: ESD术中出血源实时定位和连续监测的需求迫切，但现有AI方法仅关注出血区域分割，缺乏针对出血源检测和动态跟踪的解决方案。

Method: 引入BleedOrigin-Bench数据集和BleedOrigin-Net框架，结合检测与跟踪技术，实现从出血开始检测到持续空间跟踪的全流程。

Result: BleedOrigin-Net在出血开始检测、初始源定位和点跟踪方面分别达到96.85%、70.24%和96.11%的准确率。

Conclusion: BleedOrigin-Bench和BleedOrigin-Net填补了ESD出血源检测的空白，为AI辅助手术提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Intraoperative bleeding during Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection (ESD) poses
significant risks, demanding precise, real-time localization and continuous
monitoring of the bleeding source for effective hemostatic intervention. In
particular, endoscopists have to repeatedly flush to clear blood, allowing only
milliseconds to identify bleeding sources, an inefficient process that prolongs
operations and elevates patient risks. However, current Artificial Intelligence
(AI) methods primarily focus on bleeding region segmentation, overlooking the
critical need for accurate bleeding source detection and temporal tracking in
the challenging ESD environment, which is marked by frequent visual
obstructions and dynamic scene changes. This gap is widened by the lack of
specialized datasets, hindering the development of robust AI-assisted guidance
systems. To address these challenges, we introduce BleedOrigin-Bench, the first
comprehensive ESD bleeding source dataset, featuring 1,771 expert-annotated
bleeding sources across 106,222 frames from 44 procedures, supplemented with
39,755 pseudo-labeled frames. This benchmark covers 8 anatomical sites and 6
challenging clinical scenarios. We also present BleedOrigin-Net, a novel
dual-stage detection-tracking framework for the bleeding source localization in
ESD procedures, addressing the complete workflow from bleeding onset detection
to continuous spatial tracking. We compare with widely-used object detection
models (YOLOv11/v12), multimodal large language models, and point tracking
methods. Extensive evaluation demonstrates state-of-the-art performance,
achieving 96.85% frame-level accuracy ($\pm\leq8$ frames) for bleeding onset
detection, 70.24% pixel-level accuracy ($\leq100$ px) for initial source
detection, and 96.11% pixel-level accuracy ($\leq100$ px) for point tracking.

Abstract: One of the main challenges in the Simultaneous Localization and Mapping
(SLAM) loop closure problem is the recognition of previously visited places. In
this work, we tackle the two main problems of real-time SLAM systems: 1) loop
closure detection accuracy and 2) real-time computation constraints on the
embedded hardware. Our LoopNet method is based on a multitasking variant of the
classical ResNet architecture, adapted for online retraining on a dynamic
visual dataset and optimized for embedded devices. The online retraining is
designed using a few-shot learning approach. The architecture provides both an
index into the queried visual dataset, and a measurement of the prediction
quality. Moreover, by leveraging DISK (DIStinctive Keypoints) descriptors,
LoopNet surpasses the limitations of handcrafted features and traditional deep
learning methods, offering better performance under varying conditions. Code is

Method: 引入辅助任务增强（Auxiliary Task Augmentation）和多令牌预测（Multi-token Prediction）技术。

Result: 在COIN和CrossTask数据集上分别超越先前方法7.3%和3.4%，在Ego4D任务中表现与最优方法相当。

Conclusion: VideoPlan方法有效解决了视觉规划任务中的挑战，并展示了其泛化能力。

Abstract: Visual Planning for Assistance (VPA) aims to predict a sequence of user
actions required to achieve a specified goal based on a video showing the
user's progress. Although recent advances in multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) have shown promising results in video understanding, long-horizon
visual planning remains a challenging problem. We identify two challenges in
training large MLLMs for video-based planning tasks: (1) scarcity of procedural
annotations, limiting the model's ability to learn procedural task dynamics
effectively, and (2) inefficiency of next-token prediction objective to
explicitly capture the structured action space for visual planning when
compared to free-form, natural language. To tackle data scarcity, we introduce
Auxiliary Task Augmentation. We design and train our model on auxiliary tasks
relevant to long-horizon video-based planning (e.g., goal prediction) to
augment the model's planning ability. To more explicitly model the structured
action space unique to visual planning tasks, we leverage Multi-token
Prediction, extending traditional next-token prediction by using multiple heads
to predict multiple future tokens during training. Our approach, VideoPlan,
achieves state-of-the-art VPA performance on the COIN and CrossTask datasets,
surpassing prior methods by 7.3% and 3.4%, respectively, when predicting 3
future actions. We further extend our method to the challenging Ego4D Long-term
Action Anticipation task, and show that it is on par with the state-of-the-art
approaches despite not using specialized egocentric features. Code will be made

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 事件传感器数据稀疏且异步，传统方法将其转换为密集张量会丧失优势，而现有图方法在时空动态建模上表现不佳。

Method: 构建解耦的空间图（使用B样条基函数建模全局结构）和时间图（基于运动向量的注意力机制建模局部动态变化），替代计算昂贵的3D核。

Result: 在Gen1和eTraM数据集上，检测精度提升6%，速度提升5倍，参数减少且计算成本不变。

Conclusion: 结构化图建模有效提升了异步视觉任务的性能。

Abstract: Event-based sensors offer high temporal resolution and low latency by
generating sparse, asynchronous data. However, converting this irregular data
into dense tensors for use in standard neural networks diminishes these
inherent advantages, motivating research into graph representations. While such
methods preserve sparsity and support asynchronous inference, their performance
on downstream tasks remains limited due to suboptimal modeling of
spatiotemporal dynamics. In this work, we propose a novel spatiotemporal
multigraph representation to better capture spatial structure and temporal
changes. Our approach constructs two decoupled graphs: a spatial graph
leveraging B-spline basis functions to model global structure, and a temporal
graph utilizing motion vector-based attention for local dynamic changes. This
design enables the use of efficient 2D kernels in place of computationally
expensive 3D kernels. We evaluate our method on the Gen1 automotive and eTraM
datasets for event-based object detection, achieving over a 6% improvement in
detection accuracy compared to previous graph-based works, with a 5x speedup,
reduced parameter count, and no increase in computational cost. These results
highlight the effectiveness of structured graph modeling for asynchronous

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce MeshMamba, a neural network model for learning 3D
articulated mesh models by employing the recently proposed Mamba State Space
Models (Mamba-SSMs). MeshMamba is efficient and scalable in handling a large
number of input tokens, enabling the generation and reconstruction of body mesh
models with more than 10,000 vertices, capturing clothing and hand geometries.
The key to effectively learning MeshMamba is the serialization technique of
mesh vertices into orderings that are easily processed by Mamba. This is
achieved by sorting the vertices based on body part annotations or the 3D
vertex locations of a template mesh, such that the ordering respects the
structure of articulated shapes. Based on MeshMamba, we design 1) MambaDiff3D,
a denoising diffusion model for generating 3D articulated meshes and 2)
Mamba-HMR, a 3D human mesh recovery model that reconstructs a human body shape
and pose from a single image. Experimental results showed that MambaDiff3D can
generate dense 3D human meshes in clothes, with grasping hands, etc., and
outperforms previous approaches in the 3D human shape generation task.
Additionally, Mamba-HMR extends the capabilities of previous non-parametric
human mesh recovery approaches, which were limited to handling body-only poses
using around 500 vertex tokens, to the whole-body setting with face and hands,
while achieving competitive performance in (near) real-time.

Conclusion: 结合SSL与生成模型（扩散噪声）能显著提升表示能力，N-JEPA在分类任务中表现优异。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning has become an incredibly successful method for
feature learning, widely applied to many downstream tasks. It has proven
especially effective for discriminative tasks, surpassing the trending
generative models. However, generative models perform better in image
generation and detail enhancement. Thus, it is natural for us to find a
connection between SSL and generative models to further enhance the
representation capacity of SSL. As generative models can create new samples by
approximating the data distribution, such modeling should also lead to a
semantic understanding of the raw visual data, which is necessary for
recognition tasks. This enlightens us to combine the core principle of the
diffusion model: diffusion noise, with SSL to learn a competitive recognition
model. Specifically, diffusion noise can be viewed as a particular state of
mask that reveals a close relationship between masked image modeling (MIM) and
diffusion models. In this paper, we propose N-JEPA (Noise-based JEPA) to
incorporate diffusion noise into MIM by the position embedding of masked
tokens. The multi-level noise schedule is a series of feature augmentations to
further enhance the robustness of our model. We perform a comprehensive study
to confirm its effectiveness in the classification of downstream tasks. Codes
will be released soon in public.

Abstract: Advancements in 3D vision have increased the impact of blood vessel modeling
on medical applications. However, accurately representing the complex geometry
and topology of blood vessels remains a challenge due to their intricate
branching patterns, curvatures, and irregular shapes. In this study, we propose
a hierarchical part-based frame work for 3D vessel generation that separates
the global binary tree-like topology from local geometric details. Our approach
proceeds in three stages: (1) key graph generation to model the overall
hierarchical struc ture, (2) vessel segment generation conditioned on geometric
properties, and (3) hierarchical vessel assembly by integrating the local
segments according to the global key graph. We validate our framework on real
world datasets, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods in
modeling complex vascular networks. This work marks the first successful
application of a part-based generative approach for 3D vessel modeling, setting
a new benchmark for vascular data generation. The code is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在高风险领域（如医学影像）中，模型决策的可解释性对临床采用至关重要。

Method: 通过训练一个基于Mammo-CLIP的SAE，识别与临床相关乳腺概念（如肿块和可疑钙化）相关的潜在特征。

Result: 研究发现SAE潜在空间中的激活神经元与真实区域对齐，并揭示了影响模型决策的混杂因素。

Conclusion: 研究展示了SAE潜在表示在理解基础模型内部工作机制方面的潜力。

Abstract: Interpretability is critical in high-stakes domains such as medical imaging,
where understanding model decisions is essential for clinical adoption. In this
work, we introduce Sparse Autoencoder (SAE)-based interpretability to breast
imaging by analyzing {Mammo-CLIP}, a vision--language foundation model
pretrained on large-scale mammogram image--report pairs. We train a patch-level
\texttt{Mammo-SAE} on Mammo-CLIP to identify and probe latent features
associated with clinically relevant breast concepts such as \textit{mass} and
\textit{suspicious calcification}. Our findings reveal that top activated class
level latent neurons in the SAE latent space often tend to align with ground
truth regions, and also uncover several confounding factors influencing the
model's decision-making process. Additionally, we analyze which latent neurons
the model relies on during downstream finetuning for improving the breast
concept prediction. This study highlights the promise of interpretable SAE
latent representations in providing deeper insight into the internal workings
of foundation models at every layer for breast imaging.

Result: 在BSCD-FSL基准测试的极端域偏移场景中表现优异。

Conclusion: CP和SSTs的组合有效提升了跨域少样本学习的性能，代码已开源。

Abstract: Despite the progress in Cross-Domain Few-Shot Learning (CD-FSL), a model
pre-trained with DINO combined with a prototypical classifier outperforms the
latest SOTA methods. A crucial limitation that needs to be overcome is that
updating too many parameters of the transformers leads to overfitting due to
the scarcity of labeled samples. To address this challenge, we propose a new
concept, Coalescent Projection (CP), as an effective successor to soft prompts.
Additionally, we propose a novel pseudo-class generation method combined with
Self-Supervised Transformations (SSTs) that relies solely on the base domain to
prepare the network for encountering unseen samples from different domains. The
proposed method exhibits its effectiveness in comprehensive experiments on the
extreme domain shift scenario of the BSCD-FSL benchmark. Our code is published

Result: 实验表明，FreeCus在无需训练的情况下实现了与需训练方法相当或更优的结果，且兼容现有修复和控制模块。

Conclusion: FreeCus成功激活了扩散变压器的零样本能力，为高质量主题驱动合成提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: In light of recent breakthroughs in text-to-image (T2I) generation,
particularly with diffusion transformers (DiT), subject-driven technologies are
increasingly being employed for high-fidelity customized production that
preserves subject identity from reference inputs, enabling thrilling design
workflows and engaging entertainment. Existing alternatives typically require
either per-subject optimization via trainable text embeddings or training
specialized encoders for subject feature extraction on large-scale datasets.
Such dependencies on training procedures fundamentally constrain their
practical applications. More importantly, current methodologies fail to fully
leverage the inherent zero-shot potential of modern diffusion transformers
(e.g., the Flux series) for authentic subject-driven synthesis. To bridge this
gap, we propose FreeCus, a genuinely training-free framework that activates
DiT's capabilities through three key innovations: 1) We introduce a pivotal
attention sharing mechanism that captures the subject's layout integrity while
preserving crucial editing flexibility. 2) Through a straightforward analysis
of DiT's dynamic shifting, we propose an upgraded variant that significantly
improves fine-grained feature extraction. 3) We further integrate advanced
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to enrich cross-modal semantic
representations. Extensive experiments reflect that our method successfully
unlocks DiT's zero-shot ability for consistent subject synthesis across diverse
contexts, achieving state-of-the-art or comparable results compared to
approaches that require additional training. Notably, our framework
demonstrates seamless compatibility with existing inpainting pipelines and
control modules, facilitating more compelling experiences. Our code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于近似盲PnP的对应学习方法（MinCD-PnP），通过最小化学习到的2D和3D关键点之间的Chamfer距离，解决了传统差分PnP对噪声和异常值敏感的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 差分PnP在图像到点云（I2P）注册中对噪声和异常值高度敏感，影响了对应学习的有效性。受盲PnP对噪声和异常值的鲁棒性启发，作者提出了MinCD-PnP方法。

Method: 将盲PnP简化为最小化学习到的2D和3D关键点之间的Chamfer距离（MinCD-PnP），并设计了一个轻量级多任务学习模块MinCD-Net，可轻松集成到现有I2P注册架构中。

Result: 在7-Scenes、RGBD-V2、ScanNet和自收集数据集上的实验表明，MinCD-Net在跨场景和跨数据集设置中均优于现有方法，具有更高的内点比率（IR）和注册召回率（RR）。

Conclusion: MinCD-PnP方法通过简化盲PnP并引入MinCD-Net，显著提高了I2P注册的鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: Image-to-point-cloud (I2P) registration is a fundamental problem in computer
vision, focusing on establishing 2D-3D correspondences between an image and a
point cloud. The differential perspective-n-point (PnP) has been widely used to
supervise I2P registration networks by enforcing the projective constraints on
2D-3D correspondences. However, differential PnP is highly sensitive to noise
and outliers in the predicted correspondences. This issue hinders the
effectiveness of correspondence learning. Inspired by the robustness of blind
PnP against noise and outliers in correspondences, we propose an approximated
blind PnP based correspondence learning approach. To mitigate the high
computational cost of blind PnP, we simplify blind PnP to an amenable task of
minimizing Chamfer distance between learned 2D and 3D keypoints, called
MinCD-PnP. To effectively solve MinCD-PnP, we design a lightweight multi-task
learning module, named as MinCD-Net, which can be easily integrated into the
existing I2P registration architectures. Extensive experiments on 7-Scenes,
RGBD-V2, ScanNet, and self-collected datasets demonstrate that MinCD-Net
outperforms state-of-the-art methods and achieves a higher inlier ratio (IR)
and registration recall (RR) in both cross-scene and cross-dataset settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用条件扩散模型在人类视觉感知对齐重建上的优势，优化视频压缩的感知质量。

Method: 提出三个关键模块：多粒度条件捕捉静态与动态信息、紧凑表示高效传输、多条件训练增强鲁棒性。

Result: 在FVD和LPIPS等感知质量指标上显著优于传统和神经编解码器，尤其在高压缩比下表现突出。

Conclusion: 条件扩散模型为视频压缩提供了感知优化的有效解决方案。

Abstract: Perceptual studies demonstrate that conditional diffusion models excel at
reconstructing video content aligned with human visual perception. Building on
this insight, we propose a video compression framework that leverages
conditional diffusion models for perceptually optimized reconstruction.
Specifically, we reframe video compression as a conditional generation task,
where a generative model synthesizes video from sparse, yet informative
signals. Our approach introduces three key modules: (1) Multi-granular
conditioning that captures both static scene structure and dynamic
spatio-temporal cues; (2) Compact representations designed for efficient
transmission without sacrificing semantic richness; (3) Multi-condition
training with modality dropout and role-aware embeddings, which prevent
over-reliance on any single modality and enhance robustness. Extensive
experiments show that our method significantly outperforms both traditional and
neural codecs on perceptual quality metrics such as Fr\'echet Video Distance
(FVD) and LPIPS, especially under high compression ratios.

Result: 实验表明，该框架在物理和数字攻击检测中表现优异，无需资源密集型训练即可超越部分传统CNN模型。

Conclusion: 该框架为提升攻击检测的泛化能力提供了有前景的工具。

Abstract: Recent advances in biometric systems have significantly improved the
detection and prevention of fraudulent activities. However, as detection
methods improve, attack techniques become increasingly sophisticated. Attacks
on face recognition systems can be broadly divided into physical and digital
approaches. Traditionally, deep learning models have been the primary defence
against such attacks. While these models perform exceptionally well in
scenarios for which they have been trained, they often struggle to adapt to
different types of attacks or varying environmental conditions. These
subsystems require substantial amounts of training data to achieve reliable
performance, yet biometric data collection faces significant challenges,
including privacy concerns and the logistical difficulties of capturing diverse
attack scenarios under controlled conditions. This work investigates the
application of Vision Language Models (VLM) and proposes an in-context learning
framework for detecting physical presentation attacks and digital morphing
attacks in biometric systems. Focusing on open-source models, the first
systematic framework for the quantitative evaluation of VLMs in
security-critical scenarios through in-context learning techniques is
established. The experimental evaluation conducted on freely available
databases demonstrates that the proposed subsystem achieves competitive
performance for physical and digital attack detection, outperforming some of
the traditional CNNs without resource-intensive training. The experimental
results validate the proposed framework as a promising tool for improving
generalisation in attack detection.

Result: 在多种指纹数据集上验证了方法的有效性和泛化能力，实现了最先进的准确性和计算效率。

Conclusion: DMD方法在指纹识别中表现出色，具有大规模应用的潜力。

Abstract: Fingerprint matching under diverse capture conditions remains a fundamental
challenge in biometric recognition. To achieve robust and accurate performance
in such scenarios, we propose DMD, a minutiae-anchored local dense
representation which captures both fine-grained ridge textures and
discriminative minutiae features in a spatially structured manner.
Specifically, descriptors are extracted from local patches centered and
oriented on each detected minutia, forming a three-dimensional tensor, where
two dimensions represent spatial locations on the fingerprint plane and the
third encodes semantic features. This representation explicitly captures
abstract features of local image patches, enabling a multi-level, fine-grained
description that aggregates information from multiple minutiae and their
surrounding ridge structures. Furthermore, thanks to its strong spatial
correspondence with the patch image, DMD allows for the use of foreground
segmentation masks to identify valid descriptor regions. During matching,
comparisons are then restricted to overlapping foreground areas, improving
efficiency and robustness. Extensive experiments on rolled, plain, parital,
contactless, and latent fingerprint datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and
generalizability of the proposed method. It achieves state-of-the-art accuracy
across multiple benchmarks while maintaining high computational efficiency,
showing strong potential for large-scale fingerprint recognition. Corresponding

Motivation: 当前少样本目标检测方法在有限训练样本下难以准确提取有效通道特征，高权重通道未必有效，低权重通道可能仍有价值。

Method: 设计了SCSM模块，包含Spatial Feature Modeling (SFM)平衡空间与通道关系学习，以及基于Mamba的Channel State Modeling (CSM)模块建模通道相关性。

Result: 在VOC和COCO数据集上的实验表明，SCSM模块能提升特征表示质量，达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: SCSM模块通过空间-通道状态建模有效解决了少样本目标检测中的通道特征提取问题，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Due to the limited training samples in few-shot object detection (FSOD), we
observe that current methods may struggle to accurately extract effective
features from each channel. Specifically, this issue manifests in two aspects:
i) channels with high weights may not necessarily be effective, and ii)
channels with low weights may still hold significant value. To handle this
problem, we consider utilizing the inter-channel correlation to facilitate the
novel model's adaptation process to novel conditions, ensuring the model can
correctly highlight effective channels and rectify those incorrect ones. Since
the channel sequence is also 1-dimensional, its similarity with the temporal
sequence inspires us to take Mamba for modeling the correlation in the channel
sequence. Based on this concept, we propose a Spatial-Channel State Space
Modeling (SCSM) module for spatial-channel state modeling, which highlights the
effective patterns and rectifies those ineffective ones in feature channels. In
SCSM, we design the Spatial Feature Modeling (SFM) module to balance the
learning of spatial relationships and channel relationships, and then introduce
the Channel State Modeling (CSM) module based on Mamba to learn correlation in
channels. Extensive experiments on the VOC and COCO datasets show that the SCSM
module enables the novel detector to improve the quality of focused feature
representation in channels and achieve state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Depth estimation is a fundamental task in computer vision with diverse
applications. Recent advancements in deep learning have led to powerful depth
foundation models (DFMs), yet their evaluation remains challenging due to
inconsistencies in existing protocols. Traditional benchmarks rely on
alignment-based metrics that introduce biases, favor certain depth
representations, and complicate fair comparisons. In this work, we propose
BenchDepth, a new benchmark that evaluates DFMs through five carefully selected
downstream proxy tasks: depth completion, stereo matching, monocular
feed-forward 3D scene reconstruction, SLAM, and vision-language spatial
understanding. Unlike conventional evaluation protocols, our approach assesses
DFMs based on their practical utility in real-world applications, bypassing
problematic alignment procedures. We benchmark eight state-of-the-art DFMs and
provide an in-depth analysis of key findings and observations. We hope our work
sparks further discussion in the community on best practices for depth model
evaluation and paves the way for future research and advancements in depth
estimation.

Conclusion: ExDD通过显式双重分布建模和合成数据生成，显著提升了工业缺陷检测的性能。

Abstract: Industrial defect detection systems face critical limitations when confined
to one-class anomaly detection paradigms, which assume uniform outlier
distributions and struggle with data scarcity in realworld manufacturing
environments. We present ExDD (Explicit Dual Distribution), a novel framework
that transcends these limitations by explicitly modeling dual feature
distributions. Our approach leverages parallel memory banks that capture the
distinct statistical properties of both normality and anomalous patterns,
addressing the fundamental flaw of uniform outlier assumptions. To overcome
data scarcity, we employ latent diffusion models with domain-specific textual
conditioning, generating in-distribution synthetic defects that preserve
industrial context. Our neighborhood-aware ratio scoring mechanism elegantly
fuses complementary distance metrics, amplifying signals in regions exhibiting
both deviation from normality and similarity to known defect patterns.
Experimental validation on KSDD2 demonstrates superior performance (94.2%
I-AUROC, 97.7% P-AUROC), with optimal augmentation at 100 synthetic samples.

Abstract: The state of the art in human-centric computer vision achieves high accuracy
and robustness across a diverse range of tasks. The most effective models in
this domain have billions of parameters, thus requiring extremely large
datasets, expensive training regimes, and compute-intensive inference. In this
paper, we demonstrate that it is possible to train models on much smaller but
high-fidelity synthetic datasets, with no loss in accuracy and higher
efficiency. Using synthetic training data provides us with excellent levels of
detail and perfect labels, while providing strong guarantees for data
provenance, usage rights, and user consent. Procedural data synthesis also
provides us with explicit control on data diversity, that we can use to address
unfairness in the models we train. Extensive quantitative assessment on real
input images demonstrates accuracy of our models on three dense prediction

TL;DR: ORSANet通过多模态语义引导、多尺度交互模块和动态对抗排斥损失，提升了遮挡条件下的面部表情识别性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有FER模型在面部遮挡情况下难以提取有效特征的问题，并减少数据集偏差。

Method: 引入多模态语义引导（语义分割图和面部关键点）、多尺度交互模块（MCM）和动态对抗排斥损失（DARELoss）。

Result: 在公开基准和自建Occlu-FER数据集上达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: ORSANet在遮挡条件下表现出色，代码已开源。

Abstract: Facial expression recognition (FER) is a challenging task due to pervasive
occlusion and dataset biases. Especially when facial information is partially
occluded, existing FER models struggle to extract effective facial features,
leading to inaccurate classifications. In response, we present ORSANet, which
introduces the following three key contributions: First, we introduce auxiliary
multi-modal semantic guidance to disambiguate facial occlusion and learn
high-level semantic knowledge, which is two-fold: 1) we introduce semantic
segmentation maps as dense semantics prior to generate semantics-enhanced
facial representations; 2) we introduce facial landmarks as sparse geometric
prior to mitigate intrinsic noises in FER, such as identity and gender biases.
Second, to facilitate the effective incorporation of these two multi-modal
priors, we customize a Multi-scale Cross-interaction Module (MCM) to adaptively
fuse the landmark feature and semantics-enhanced representations within
different scales. Third, we design a Dynamic Adversarial Repulsion Enhancement
Loss (DARELoss) that dynamically adjusts the margins of ambiguous classes,
further enhancing the model's ability to distinguish similar expressions. We
further construct the first occlusion-oriented FER dataset to facilitate
specialized robustness analysis on various real-world occlusion conditions,
dubbed Occlu-FER. Extensive experiments on both public benchmarks and Occlu-FER
demonstrate that our proposed ORSANet achieves SOTA recognition performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型在手术阶段识别中缺乏可解释性，阻碍了信任和调试。

Result: 在两个手术阶段识别模型上验证了方法的有效性，并分析了预测解释。

Conclusion: SurgX展示了在解释手术阶段识别方面的潜力。

Abstract: Surgical phase recognition plays a crucial role in surgical workflow
analysis, enabling various applications such as surgical monitoring, skill
assessment, and workflow optimization. Despite significant advancements in deep
learning-based surgical phase recognition, these models remain inherently
opaque, making it difficult to understand how they make decisions. This lack of
interpretability hinders trust and makes it challenging to debug the model. To
address this challenge, we propose SurgX, a novel concept-based explanation
framework that enhances the interpretability of surgical phase recognition
models by associating neurons with relevant concepts. In this paper, we
introduce the process of selecting representative example sequences for
neurons, constructing a concept set tailored to the surgical video dataset,
associating neurons with concepts and identifying neurons crucial for
predictions. Through extensive experiments on two surgical phase recognition
models, we validate our method and analyze the explanation for prediction. This
highlights the potential of our method in explaining surgical phase
recognition. The code is available at https://github.com/ailab-kyunghee/SurgX

TL;DR: EgoPrune是一种无需训练的自适应令牌修剪方法，专为第一人称视频推理设计，通过关键帧选择、视角感知冗余过滤和基于MMR的令牌选择，显著提升效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 第一人称视频推理对嵌入式AI代理至关重要，但现有方法计算成本高且未充分利用时空连续性。

Method: EgoPrune包含关键帧选择、视角感知冗余过滤（PARF）和基于MMR的令牌选择器。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，EgoPrune优于现有方法，显著降低计算资源消耗。

Conclusion: EgoPrune适用于边缘设备，展示了实际部署的高效性。

Abstract: Egomotion videos are first-person recordings where the view changes
continuously due to the agent's movement. As they serve as the primary visual
input for embodied AI agents, making egomotion video reasoning more efficient
is therefore essential for real-world deployment. Recent advances in
vision-language models have enabled strong multimodal reasoning capabilities,
but their computational cost remains prohibitive for long, redundant video
inputs. Existing token pruning methods, typically designed for third-person
videos, fail to leverage the spatiotemporal continuity and motion constraints
inherent in egomotion settings. To address this, we propose EgoPrune, a
training-free token pruning method tailored for egomotion video reasoning.
EgoPrune comprises three components: a keyframe selector adapted from EmbodiedR
for temporally efficient sampling; Perspective-Aware Redundancy Filtering
(PARF), which aligns visual tokens using perspective transformations and
removes redundant tokens; and a Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR)-based token
selector that jointly considers visual-text relevance and intra-frame
diversity. Experiments on two egomotion video benchmarks show that EgoPrune
consistently outperforms prior training-free methods across various pruning
ratios while significantly reducing FLOPs, memory usage, and latency. Moreover,
we deploy EgoPrune on an embodied agent equipped with a Jetson Orin NX 16GB
edge device, demonstrating its real-world efficiency and suitability for
on-device egomotion video reasoning.

Motivation: 现有方法通常单独优化文本或视觉表示，忽略了融合表示在决策中的关键作用。

Method: RAda使用轻量级注意力层生成学习掩码，动态调整融合表示中各元素的贡献。

Result: 在不同设置下，RAda均能显著提升基线性能，且与现有方法表现相当。

Conclusion: RAda是一种通用的微调技术，适用于多种场景，且实现简单。

Abstract: Pretrained vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, achieve remarkable
zero-shot performance, yet their downstream potential hinges on effective
fine-tuning. Most adaptation methods typically focus on refining representation
from separate modalities (text or vision) but neglect the critical role of
their fused representations in the decision-making process, \emph{\ie} rational
matrix that drives the final prediction. To bridge the gap, we propose a simple
yet effective \textbf{R}ational \textbf{Ada}ptaion ({RAda}) to explicitly
exploit the final fused representation during fine-tuning. RAda employs a
learned mask, obtained from a lightweight attention layer attached at the end
of a VLM, to dynamically calibrate the contribution of each element in the
rational matrix, enabling targeted adjustments to the final cross-modal
interactions without incurring costly modifications to intermediate features.
Experiments in different settings (i.e., updating, or freezing pretrained
encoders in adaptation, and test-time training that can only access the
unlabeled test data) show that RAda serves as a versatile fine-tuning
technique, improving the baseline with minimal code and performing comparably
against current arts in most settings. Code is available at

Conclusion: 该数据集为改进复杂环境中的异常检测提供了基准，并支持动态标注和在线查看。

Abstract: After a family murder in rural Germany, authorities failed to locate the
suspect in a vast forest despite a massive search. To aid the search, a
research aircraft captured high-resolution aerial imagery. Due to dense
vegetation obscuring small clues, automated analysis was ineffective, prompting
a crowd-search initiative. This effort produced a unique dataset of labeled,
hard-to-detect anomalies under occluded, real-world conditions. It can serve as
a benchmark for improving anomaly detection approaches in complex forest
environments, supporting manhunts and rescue operations. Initial benchmark
tests showed existing methods performed poorly, highlighting the need for
context-aware approaches. The dataset is openly accessible for offline
processing. An additional interactive web interface supports online viewing and
dynamic growth by allowing users to annotate and submit new findings.

TL;DR: UMIVR是一个基于不确定性最小化的交互式文本到视频检索框架，通过量化文本模糊性、映射不确定性和帧不确定性，生成有针对性的澄清问题，显著减少检索模糊性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本到视频检索（TVR）存在文本查询模糊、文本-视频映射不清晰和视频帧质量低等问题，现有方法缺乏对这些不确定性的量化，限制了效果。

Method: UMIVR通过训练无关的指标（如基于语义熵的文本模糊性评分、基于Jensen-Shannon散度的映射不确定性评分和基于时序质量的帧采样器）量化不确定性，并生成澄清问题迭代优化查询。

Result: 在MSR-VTT-1k数据集上，UMIVR在10轮交互后Recall@1达到69.2%，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: UMIVR为交互式TVR建立了不确定性最小化的基础，显著提升了检索效果。

Abstract: Despite recent advances, Text-to-video retrieval (TVR) is still hindered by
multiple inherent uncertainties, such as ambiguous textual queries, indistinct
text-video mappings, and low-quality video frames. Although interactive systems
have emerged to address these challenges by refining user intent through
clarifying questions, current methods typically rely on heuristic or ad-hoc
strategies without explicitly quantifying these uncertainties, limiting their
effectiveness. Motivated by this gap, we propose UMIVR, an
Uncertainty-Minimizing Interactive Text-to-Video Retrieval framework that
explicitly quantifies three critical uncertainties-text ambiguity, mapping
uncertainty, and frame uncertainty-via principled, training-free metrics:
semantic entropy-based Text Ambiguity Score (TAS), Jensen-Shannon
divergence-based Mapping Uncertainty Score (MUS), and a Temporal Quality-based
Frame Sampler (TQFS). By adaptively generating targeted clarifying questions
guided by these uncertainty measures, UMIVR iteratively refines user queries,
significantly reducing retrieval ambiguity. Extensive experiments on multiple
benchmarks validate UMIVR's effectiveness, achieving notable gains in Recall@1
(69.2\% after 10 interactive rounds) on the MSR-VTT-1k dataset, thereby
establishing an uncertainty-minimizing foundation for interactive TVR.

Motivation: 现有Transformer方法在非均匀光照场景（如背光和阴影）中表现不佳，容易出现过度曝光或亮度恢复不足的问题。

Method: 提出动态积分图像表示和SAI²E估计器，结合光照引导的多头自注意力机制（IG-MSA）校准特征。

Result: 在多个数据集上显著优于现有方法，尤其在非均匀光照增强中表现优异，并展示了强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: SAIGFormer在低光增强任务中表现出色，特别是在非均匀光照场景下，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Recent Transformer-based low-light enhancement methods have made promising
progress in recovering global illumination. However, they still struggle with
non-uniform lighting scenarios, such as backlit and shadow, appearing as
over-exposure or inadequate brightness restoration. To address this challenge,
we present a Spatially-Adaptive Illumination-Guided Transformer (SAIGFormer)
framework that enables accurate illumination restoration. Specifically, we
propose a dynamic integral image representation to model the spatially-varying
illumination, and further construct a novel Spatially-Adaptive Integral
Illumination Estimator ($\text{SAI}^2\text{E}$). Moreover, we introduce an
Illumination-Guided Multi-head Self-Attention (IG-MSA) mechanism, which
leverages the illumination to calibrate the lightness-relevant features toward
visual-pleased illumination enhancement. Extensive experiments on five standard
low-light datasets and a cross-domain benchmark (LOL-Blur) demonstrate that our
SAIGFormer significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both
quantitative and qualitative metrics. In particular, our method achieves
superior performance in non-uniform illumination enhancement while exhibiting
strong generalization capabilities across multiple datasets. Code is available

Method: 提出了一种融合Gromov-Wasserstein最优传输和结构先验的自监督框架，并引入对比正则化避免嵌入空间退化。

Result: 在EgoProceL、ProceL和CrossTask等大规模基准测试中表现优于传统方法（如OPEL）。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了自监督过程学习中的关键挑战，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: We study the problem of self-supervised procedure learning, which discovers
key steps and establishes their order from a set of unlabeled procedural
videos. Previous procedure learning methods typically learn frame-to-frame
correspondences between videos before determining key steps and their order.
However, their performance often suffers from order variations,
background/redundant frames, and repeated actions. To overcome these
challenges, we propose a self-supervised procedure learning framework, which
utilizes a fused Gromov-Wasserstein optimal transport formulation with a
structural prior for computing frame-to-frame mapping between videos. However,
optimizing exclusively for the above temporal alignment term may lead to
degenerate solutions, where all frames are mapped to a small cluster in the
embedding space and hence every video is associated with only one key step. To
address that limitation, we further integrate a contrastive regularization
term, which maps different frames to different points in the embedding space,
avoiding the collapse to trivial solutions. Finally, we conduct extensive
experiments on large-scale egocentric (i.e., EgoProceL) and third-person (i.e.,
ProceL and CrossTask) benchmarks to demonstrate superior performance by our
approach against previous methods, including OPEL which relies on a traditional
Kantorovich optimal transport formulation with an optimality prior.

Conclusion: 研究强调了工具-动作-目标组合和操作手身份在图表示中的重要性，为手术场景理解提供了更全面的方法。

Abstract: Surgical scene understanding is crucial for computer-assisted intervention
systems, requiring visual comprehension of surgical scenes that involves
diverse elements such as surgical tools, anatomical structures, and their
interactions. To effectively represent the complex information in surgical
scenes, graph-based approaches have been explored to structurally model
surgical entities and their relationships. Previous surgical scene graph
studies have demonstrated the feasibility of representing surgical scenes using
graphs. However, certain aspects of surgical scenes-such as diverse
combinations of tool-action-target and the identity of the hand operating the
tool-remain underexplored in graph-based representations, despite their
importance. To incorporate these aspects into graph representations, we propose
Endoscapes-SG201 dataset, which includes annotations for tool-action-target
combinations and hand identity. We also introduce SSG-Com, a graph-based method
designed to learn and represent these critical elements. Through experiments on
downstream tasks such as critical view of safety assessment and action triplet
recognition, we demonstrated the importance of integrating these essential
scene graph components, highlighting their significant contribution to surgical
scene understanding. The code and dataset are available at

Result: 在HICO-DET上达到未见类mAP 27.91，刷新零样本HOI检测性能。

Conclusion: HOLa通过特征分解和权重适应，显著提升了零样本HOI检测的泛化和区分能力。

Abstract: Zero-shot human-object interaction (HOI) detection remains a challenging
task, particularly in generalizing to unseen actions. Existing methods address
this challenge by tapping Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to access knowledge
beyond the training data. However, they either struggle to distinguish actions
involving the same object or demonstrate limited generalization to unseen
classes. In this paper, we introduce HOLa (Zero-Shot HOI Detection with
Low-Rank Decomposed VLM Feature Adaptation), a novel approach that both
enhances generalization to unseen classes and improves action distinction. In
training, HOLa decomposes VLM text features for given HOI classes via low-rank
factorization, producing class-shared basis features and adaptable weights.
These features and weights form a compact HOI representation that preserves
shared information across classes, enhancing generalization to unseen classes.
Subsequently, we refine action distinction by adapting weights for each HOI
class and introducing human-object tokens to enrich visual interaction
representations. To further distinguish unseen actions, we guide the weight
adaptation with LLM-derived action regularization. Experimental results show
that our method sets a new state-of-the-art across zero-shot HOI settings on
HICO-DET, achieving an unseen-class mAP of 27.91 in the unseen-verb setting.

Method: 提出DynImg方法，利用非关键帧作为时间提示，突出快速移动物体的空间区域，并结合4D视频旋转位置嵌入保持时空顺序。

Result: DynImg在多个视频理解基准上优于现有方法约2%。

Conclusion: DynImg通过时间提示和4D嵌入有效提升了视频理解的准确性。

Abstract: In recent years, the introduction of Multi-modal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) into video understanding tasks has become increasingly prevalent.
However, how to effectively integrate temporal information remains a critical
research focus. Traditional approaches treat spatial and temporal information
separately. Due to issues like motion blur, it is challenging to accurately
represent the spatial information of rapidly moving objects. This can lead to
temporally important regions being underemphasized during spatial feature
extraction, which in turn hinders accurate spatio-temporal interaction and
video understanding. To address this limitation, we propose an innovative video
representation method called Dynamic-Image (DynImg). Specifically, we introduce
a set of non-key frames as temporal prompts to highlight the spatial areas
containing fast-moving objects. During the process of visual feature
extraction, these prompts guide the model to pay additional attention to the
fine-grained spatial features corresponding to these regions. Moreover, to
maintain the correct sequence for DynImg, we employ a corresponding 4D video
Rotary Position Embedding. This retains both the temporal and spatial adjacency
of DynImg, helping MLLM understand the spatio-temporal order within this
combined format. Experimental evaluations reveal that DynImg surpasses the
state-of-the-art methods by approximately 2% across multiple video
understanding benchmarks, proving the effectiveness of our temporal prompts in
enhancing video comprehension.

Motivation: 传统mixup的像素级插值可能生成不真实图像，影响学习效果，尤其在医疗等高风险领域。

Method: 使用StyleGAN2-ADA生成器，通过Dirichlet和Beta分布混合标签向量，生成连续类流形上的图像。

Result: 在COVIDx-CT-3数据集上，GeMix结合真实数据显著提升分类性能，降低COVID-19检测的假阴性率。

Conclusion: GeMix可作为传统mixup的直接替代，提供更强的正则化和语义保真度，且不破坏现有训练流程。

Abstract: Mixup has become a popular augmentation strategy for image classification,
yet its naive pixel-wise interpolation often produces unrealistic images that
can hinder learning, particularly in high-stakes medical applications. We
propose GeMix, a two-stage framework that replaces heuristic blending with a
learned, label-aware interpolation powered by class-conditional GANs. First, a
StyleGAN2-ADA generator is trained on the target dataset. During augmentation,
we sample two label vectors from Dirichlet priors biased toward different
classes and blend them via a Beta-distributed coefficient. Then, we condition
the generator on this soft label to synthesize visually coherent images that
lie along a continuous class manifold. We benchmark GeMix on the large-scale
COVIDx-CT-3 dataset using three backbones (ResNet-50, ResNet-101,
EfficientNet-B0). When combined with real data, our method increases macro-F1
over traditional mixup for all backbones, reducing the false negative rate for
COVID-19 detection. GeMix is thus a drop-in replacement for pixel-space mixup,
delivering stronger regularization and greater semantic fidelity, without
disrupting existing training pipelines. We publicly release our code at
https://github.com/hugocarlesso/GeMix to foster reproducibility and further
research.

Conclusion: 该研究首次将卫星上变化检测任务整合为端到端框架，为实时应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Change detection from satellite images typically incurs a delay ranging from
several hours up to days because of latency in downlinking the acquired images
and generating orthorectified image products at the ground stations; this may
preclude real- or near real-time applications. To overcome this limitation, we
propose shifting the entire change detection workflow onboard satellites. This
requires to simultaneously solve challenges in data storage, image registration
and change detection with a strict complexity constraint. In this paper, we
present a novel and efficient framework for onboard change detection that
addresses the aforementioned challenges in an end-to-end fashion with a deep
neural network composed of three interlinked submodules: (1) image compression,
tailored to minimize onboard data storage resources; (2) lightweight
co-registration of non-orthorectified multi-temporal image pairs; and (3) a
novel temporally-invariant and computationally efficient change detection
model. This is the first approach in the literature combining all these tasks
in a single end-to-end framework with the constraints dictated by onboard
processing. Experimental results compare each submodule with the current
state-of-the-art, and evaluate the performance of the overall integrated system
in realistic setting on low-power hardware. Compelling change detection results
are obtained in terms of F1 score as a function of compression rate, sustaining
a throughput of 0.7 Mpixel/s on a 15W accelerator.

Abstract: Surface reconstruction and novel view rendering from sparse-view images are
challenging. Signed Distance Function (SDF)-based methods struggle with fine
details, while 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)-based approaches lack global
geometry coherence. We propose a novel hybrid method that combines the
strengths of both approaches: SDF captures coarse geometry to enhance
3DGS-based rendering, while newly rendered images from 3DGS refine the details
of SDF for accurate surface reconstruction. As a result, our method surpasses

*Ru Jia,Xiaozhuang Ma,Jianji Wang,Nanning Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于圆柱坐标系的CylinderPlane表示方法，解决了Tri-plane表示中的多视角一致性问题，实现了高质量、无伪影的360°图像合成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tri-plane表示在3D感知图像生成中存在多视角一致性问题，如对称区域共享特征导致的多面伪影，限制了360°视图图像的生成能力。

Method: 采用圆柱坐标系构建CylinderPlane表示，明确分离不同角度的特征，并引入嵌套圆柱表示以处理复杂几何和多分辨率需求。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在合成数据集和真实图像上均优于现有方法，实现了高质量、无伪影的360°图像合成。

Conclusion: CylinderPlane表示有效解决了Tri-plane的局限性，为360°图像生成提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: While the proposal of the Tri-plane representation has advanced the
development of the 3D-aware image generative models, problems rooted in its
inherent structure, such as multi-face artifacts caused by sharing the same
features in symmetric regions, limit its ability to generate 360$^\circ$ view
images. In this paper, we propose CylinderPlane, a novel implicit
representation based on Cylindrical Coordinate System, to eliminate the feature
ambiguity issue and ensure multi-view consistency in 360$^\circ$. Different
from the inevitable feature entanglement in Cartesian coordinate-based
Tri-plane representation, the cylindrical coordinate system explicitly
separates features at different angles, allowing our cylindrical representation
possible to achieve high-quality, artifacts-free 360$^\circ$ image synthesis.
We further introduce the nested cylinder representation that composites
multiple cylinders at different scales, thereby enabling the model more
adaptable to complex geometry and varying resolutions. The combination of
cylinders with different resolutions can effectively capture more critical
locations and multi-scale features, greatly facilitates fine detail learning
and robustness to different resolutions. Moreover, our representation is
agnostic to implicit rendering methods and can be easily integrated into any
neural rendering pipeline. Extensive experiments on both synthetic dataset and
unstructured in-the-wild images demonstrate that our proposed representation
achieves superior performance over previous methods.

Motivation: 解决OMR中标注数据稀缺和历史手稿复杂性的问题，探索AL和SL在数据稀缺场景下的应用潜力。

Method: 基于YOLOv8，采用不确定性选择样本进行迭代标注和训练，从单张标注图像开始逐步提升性能。

Result: 在少量标注下实现与全监督训练相当的精度，但不确定性AL在特定中世纪手稿中效果不佳。

Conclusion: 不确定性AL在特定场景下效果有限，需探索更适用的方法以应对数据稀缺问题。

Abstract: Optical Music Recognition (OMR) is a cornerstone of music digitization
initiatives in cultural heritage, yet it remains limited by the scarcity of
annotated data and the complexity of historical manuscripts. In this paper, we
present a preliminary study of Active Learning (AL) and Sequential Learning
(SL) tailored for object detection and layout recognition in an old medieval
music manuscript. Leveraging YOLOv8, our system selects samples with the
highest uncertainty (lowest prediction confidence) for iterative labeling and
retraining. Our approach starts with a single annotated image and successfully
boosts performance while minimizing manual labeling. Experimental results
indicate that comparable accuracy to fully supervised training can be achieved
with significantly fewer labeled examples. We test the methodology as a
preliminary investigation on a novel dataset offered to the community by the
Anonymous project, which studies laude, a poetical-musical genre spread across
Italy during the 12th-16th Century. We show that in the manuscript at-hand,
uncertainty-based AL is not effective and advocates for more usable methods in
data-scarcity scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度伪造技术对信息完整性和社会信任构成挑战，现有检测方法模型庞大且机制不明确，难以在资源有限环境中部署。

Method: 采用彩票假设（LTH）和迭代幅度剪枝方法，在MesoNet、CNN-5和ResNet-18架构上进行实验，分析关键特征。

Result: 在80%稀疏度下，MesoNet在OpenForensic数据集上保持56.2%准确率（基线为62.6%），仅需3,000参数。LTH剪枝方法优于一次性剪枝。

Conclusion: 深度伪造检测网络存在关键子网络（“中奖彩票”），可高效剪枝并保持性能，具有跨数据集迁移潜力，适合实际部署。

Abstract: Recent advances in deepfake technology have created increasingly convincing
synthetic media that poses significant challenges to information integrity and
social trust. While current detection methods show promise, their underlying
mechanisms remain poorly understood, and the large sizes of their models make
them challenging to deploy in resource-limited environments. This study
investigates the application of the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (LTH) to deepfake
detection, aiming to identify the key features crucial for recognizing
deepfakes. We examine how neural networks can be efficiently pruned while
maintaining high detection accuracy. Through extensive experiments with
MesoNet, CNN-5, and ResNet-18 architectures on the OpenForensic and
FaceForensics++ datasets, we find that deepfake detection networks contain
winning tickets, i.e., subnetworks, that preserve performance even at
substantial sparsity levels. Our results indicate that MesoNet retains 56.2%
accuracy at 80% sparsity on the OpenForensic dataset, with only 3,000
parameters, which is about 90% of its baseline accuracy (62.6%). The results
also show that our proposed LTH-based iterative magnitude pruning approach
consistently outperforms one-shot pruning methods. Using Grad-CAM
visualization, we analyze how pruned networks maintain their focus on critical
facial regions for deepfake detection. Additionally, we demonstrate the
transferability of winning tickets across datasets, suggesting potential for
efficient, deployable deepfake detection systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为EVA的训练无关方法，通过动态选择中间层提取视觉事实知识，显著减少多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）中的幻觉现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs在结合视觉和语言理解方面取得进展，但仍存在对象幻觉问题，即生成看似合理但实际错误的输出。研究发现先验知识在深层抑制视觉信息，但中间层的机制尚不明确。

Method: 提出EVA方法，通过对比原始输入和纯文本输入的中间层输出分布，动态选择视觉事实信息最显著的层，并将其融入最终层以修正输出。

Result: 实验表明，EVA显著降低了幻觉率，优于基线方法。

Conclusion: EVA是一种模型无关、无需训练的方法，能有效缓解MLLMs中的幻觉问题，且兼容多种解码策略。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made significant strides by
combining visual recognition and language understanding to generate content
that is both coherent and contextually accurate. However, MLLMs continue to
struggle with object hallucinations, where models produce seemingly plausible
but factually incorrect outputs, including objects that do not exist in the
image. Recent work has revealed that the prior knowledge in MLLMs significantly
suppresses visual information in deep layers, causing hallucinatory outputs.
However, how these priors suppress visual information at the intermediate layer
stage in MLLMs remains unclear. We observe that visual factual knowledge and
the differences between intermediate-layer prior/original probability
distributions show similar evolutionary trends in intermediate layers.
Motivated by this, we introduce Decoding by Extracting Visual Facts (EVA), a
simple, training-free method that dynamically selects intermediate layers with
the most significant visual factual information. By contrasting the output
distributions of the selected layer derived from the original input and
pure-text input, EVA extracts visual factual knowledge and proportionally
incorporates it into the final layer to correct the output logits. Importantly,
EVA is model-agnostic, seamlessly integrates with various classic decoding
strategies, and is applicable across different MLLMs. We validate EVA on
widely-used benchmarks, and the results show that it significantly reduces
hallucination rates compared to baseline methods, underscoring its
effectiveness in mitigating hallucinations.

Abstract: Image Quality Assessment (IQA) is a core task in computer vision. Multimodal
methods based on vision-language models, such as CLIP, have demonstrated
exceptional generalization capabilities in IQA tasks. To address the issues of
excessive parameter burden and insufficient ability to identify local distorted
features in CLIP for IQA, this study proposes a visual-language model knowledge
distillation method aimed at guiding the training of models with architectural
advantages using CLIP's IQA knowledge. First, quality-graded prompt templates
were designed to guide CLIP to output quality scores. Then, CLIP is fine-tuned
to enhance its capabilities in IQA tasks. Finally, a modality-adaptive
knowledge distillation strategy is proposed to achieve guidance from the CLIP
teacher model to the student model. Our experiments were conducted on multiple
IQA datasets, and the results show that the proposed method significantly
reduces model complexity while outperforming existing IQA methods,
demonstrating strong potential for practical deployment.

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Visual relocalization, which estimates the 6-degree-of-freedom (6-DoF) camera
pose from query images, is fundamental to remote sensing and UAV applications.
Existing methods face inherent trade-offs: image-based retrieval and pose
regression approaches lack precision, while structure-based methods that
register queries to Structure-from-Motion (SfM) models suffer from
computational complexity and limited scalability. These challenges are
particularly pronounced in remote sensing scenarios due to large-scale scenes,
high altitude variations, and domain gaps of existing visual priors. To
overcome these limitations, we leverage 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) as a novel
scene representation that compactly encodes both 3D geometry and appearance. We
introduce $\mathrm{Hi}^2$-GSLoc, a dual-hierarchical relocalization framework
that follows a sparse-to-dense and coarse-to-fine paradigm, fully exploiting
the rich semantic information and geometric constraints inherent in Gaussian
primitives. To handle large-scale remote sensing scenarios, we incorporate
partitioned Gaussian training, GPU-accelerated parallel matching, and dynamic
memory management strategies. Our approach consists of two stages: (1) a sparse
stage featuring a Gaussian-specific consistent render-aware sampling strategy
and landmark-guided detector for robust and accurate initial pose estimation,
and (2) a dense stage that iteratively refines poses through coarse-to-fine
dense rasterization matching while incorporating reliability verification.
Through comprehensive evaluation on simulation data, public datasets, and real
flight experiments, we demonstrate that our method delivers competitive
localization accuracy, recall rate, and computational efficiency while
effectively filtering unreliable pose estimates. The results confirm the
effectiveness of our approach for practical remote sensing applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于隐式神经表示（INR）的无损点云几何压缩方法（LINR-PCGC），通过优化编码框架和网络设计，显著提升了压缩效率和速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI点云压缩方法依赖特定训练数据分布，限制了实际应用；INR方法虽能解决分布问题，但仅支持有损压缩且编码时间和解码器大小受限。

Method: 设计了点云级编码框架和高效网络初始化策略，结合多尺度SparseConv的轻量级网络，实现快速推理和小型解码器。

Result: 实验表明，LINR-PCGC在MVUB数据集上比G-PCC TMC13v23和SparsePCGC分别减少21.21%和21.95%的比特流。

Conclusion: LINR-PCGC是首个基于INR的无损点云压缩方法，显著提升了压缩效率和实用性。

Abstract: Existing AI-based point cloud compression methods struggle with dependence on
specific training data distributions, which limits their real-world deployment.
Implicit Neural Representation (INR) methods solve the above problem by
encoding overfitted network parameters to the bitstream, resulting in more
distribution-agnostic results. However, due to the limitation of encoding time
and decoder size, current INR based methods only consider lossy geometry
compression. In this paper, we propose the first INR based lossless point cloud
geometry compression method called Lossless Implicit Neural Representations for
Point Cloud Geometry Compression (LINR-PCGC). To accelerate encoding speed, we
design a group of point clouds level coding framework with an effective network
initialization strategy, which can reduce around 60% encoding time. A
lightweight coding network based on multiscale SparseConv, consisting of scale
context extraction, child node prediction, and model compression modules, is
proposed to realize fast inference and compact decoder size. Experimental
results show that our method consistently outperforms traditional and AI-based
methods: for example, with the convergence time in the MVUB dataset, our method
reduces the bitstream by approximately 21.21% compared to G-PCC TMC13v23 and
21.95% compared to SparsePCGC. Our project can be seen on

TL;DR: DWTGS提出了一种基于小波变换的频率正则化方法，通过监督低频子带并自监督高频子带，提升了稀疏视图3D高斯泼溅的重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏视图3D高斯泼溅在重建高质量新视图时容易过拟合高频细节，现有基于傅里叶变换的频率正则化方法参数调优困难且偏向有害高频学习。

Method: DWTGS利用小波空间损失提供额外的空间监督，仅监督多级DWT的低频LL子带，同时自监督高频HH子带的稀疏性。

Result: 实验表明，DWTGS在多个基准测试中优于基于傅里叶变换的方法，低频中心策略提高了泛化能力并减少了高频幻觉。

Conclusion: DWTGS通过小波变换的频率正则化方法有效解决了稀疏视图3D高斯泼溅的过拟合问题，提升了重建质量。

Abstract: Sparse-view 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) presents significant challenges in
reconstructing high-quality novel views, as it often overfits to the
widely-varying high-frequency (HF) details of the sparse training views. While
frequency regularization can be a promising approach, its typical reliance on
Fourier transforms causes difficult parameter tuning and biases towards
detrimental HF learning. We propose DWTGS, a framework that rethinks frequency
regularization by leveraging wavelet-space losses that provide additional
spatial supervision. Specifically, we supervise only the low-frequency (LF) LL
subbands at multiple DWT levels, while enforcing sparsity on the HF HH subband
in a self-supervised manner. Experiments across benchmarks show that DWTGS
consistently outperforms Fourier-based counterparts, as this LF-centric
strategy improves generalization and reduces HF hallucinations.

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了高效且高性能的FIQA，适用于实际部署。

Abstract: Face image quality assessment (FIQA) is essential for various face-related
applications. Although FIQA has been extensively studied and achieved
significant progress, the computational complexity of FIQA algorithms remains a
key concern for ensuring scalability and practical deployment in real-world
systems. In this paper, we aim to develop a computationally efficient FIQA
method that can be easily deployed in real-world applications. Specifically,
our method consists of two stages: training a powerful teacher model and
distilling a lightweight student model from it. To build a strong teacher
model, we adopt a self-training strategy to improve its capacity. We first
train the teacher model using labeled face images, then use it to generate
pseudo-labels for a set of unlabeled images. These pseudo-labeled samples are
used in two ways: (1) to distill knowledge into the student model, and (2) to
combine with the original labeled images to further enhance the teacher model
through self-training. The enhanced teacher model is used to further
pseudo-label another set of unlabeled images for distilling the student models.
The student model is trained using a combination of labeled images,
pseudo-labeled images from the original teacher model, and pseudo-labeled
images from the enhanced teacher model. Experimental results demonstrate that
our student model achieves comparable performance to the teacher model with an
extremely low computational overhead. Moreover, our method achieved first place
in the ICCV 2025 VQualA FIQA Challenge. The code is available at

Motivation: 研究动机是解决现有空间控制图像生成模型在科学比较上的不足，澄清文献中的知识空白，并为开发者提供实用的技术见解。

Method: 方法包括在ImageNet上进行受控实验，比较扩散模型、流模型和自回归模型，提出控制标记预填充作为基线方法，并研究采样时间增强技术。

Result: 结果显示控制标记预填充是一种简单且高效的方法，采样时间增强技术（如扩展无分类器引导和softmax截断）显著提高了控制与生成的一致性。

Conclusion: 结论是适配器方法在有限下游数据下能保持生成质量，但在控制一致性上表现不如完整训练，同时强调了采样时间增强的重要性。

Abstract: Enabling image generation models to be spatially controlled is an important
area of research, empowering users to better generate images according to their
own fine-grained specifications via e.g. edge maps, poses. Although this task
has seen impressive improvements in recent times, a focus on rapidly producing
stronger models has come at the cost of detailed and fair scientific
comparison. Differing training data, model architectures and generation
paradigms make it difficult to disentangle the factors contributing to
performance. Meanwhile, the motivations and nuances of certain approaches
become lost in the literature. In this work, we aim to provide clear takeaways
across generation paradigms for practitioners wishing to develop
transformer-based systems for spatially-controlled generation, clarifying the
literature and addressing knowledge gaps. We perform controlled experiments on
ImageNet across diffusion-based/flow-based and autoregressive (AR) models.
First, we establish control token prefilling as a simple, general and
performant baseline approach for transformers. We then investigate previously
underexplored sampling time enhancements, showing that extending
classifier-free guidance to control, as well as softmax truncation, have a
strong impact on control-generation consistency. Finally, we re-clarify the
motivation of adapter-based approaches, demonstrating that they mitigate
"forgetting" and maintain generation quality when trained on limited downstream
data, but underperform full training in terms of generation-control
consistency. Code will be released upon publication.

Motivation: 扩散模型在生成短视频时表现良好，但在生成长视频时面临内存和一致性问题。

Conclusion: TokensGen为长视频生成提供了可扩展的模块化解决方案，适用于叙事、电影制作和沉浸式模拟。

Abstract: Generating consistent long videos is a complex challenge: while
diffusion-based generative models generate visually impressive short clips,
extending them to longer durations often leads to memory bottlenecks and
long-term inconsistency. In this paper, we propose TokensGen, a novel two-stage
framework that leverages condensed tokens to address these issues. Our method
decomposes long video generation into three core tasks: (1) inner-clip semantic
control, (2) long-term consistency control, and (3) inter-clip smooth
transition. First, we train To2V (Token-to-Video), a short video diffusion
model guided by text and video tokens, with a Video Tokenizer that condenses
short clips into semantically rich tokens. Second, we introduce T2To
(Text-to-Token), a video token diffusion transformer that generates all tokens
at once, ensuring global consistency across clips. Finally, during inference,
an adaptive FIFO-Diffusion strategy seamlessly connects adjacent clips,
reducing boundary artifacts and enhancing smooth transitions. Experimental
results demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances long-term temporal
and content coherence without incurring prohibitive computational overhead. By
leveraging condensed tokens and pre-trained short video models, our method
provides a scalable, modular solution for long video generation, opening new
possibilities for storytelling, cinematic production, and immersive
simulations. Please see our project page at

Method: 使用Transformer预测空间自适应双边网格，校正光度变化，并将其集成到3D高斯泼溅管线中，实现多视角一致性。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在重建质量和收敛速度上优于或匹配现有场景特定优化方法。

Conclusion: 该方法通过高效的光度校正，提升了多视角重建的质量和效率，且具有跨场景泛化能力。

Abstract: Modern camera pipelines apply extensive on-device processing, such as
exposure adjustment, white balance, and color correction, which, while
beneficial individually, often introduce photometric inconsistencies across
views. These appearance variations violate multi-view consistency and degrade
the quality of novel view synthesis. Joint optimization of scene
representations and per-image appearance embeddings has been proposed to
address this issue, but at the cost of increased computational complexity and
slower training. In this work, we propose a transformer-based method that
predicts spatially adaptive bilateral grids to correct photometric variations
in a multi-view consistent manner, enabling robust cross-scene generalization
without the need for scene-specific retraining. By incorporating the learned
grids into the 3D Gaussian Splatting pipeline, we improve reconstruction
quality while maintaining high training efficiency. Extensive experiments show
that our approach outperforms or matches existing scene-specific optimization
methods in reconstruction fidelity and convergence speed.

Conclusion: HDF框架在动态面部表情识别中表现出色，具有广泛的适用性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Dynamic Facial Expression Recognition (DFER) plays a critical role in
affective computing and human-computer interaction. Although existing methods
achieve comparable performance, they inevitably suffer from performance
degradation under sample heterogeneity caused by multi-source data and
individual expression variability. To address these challenges, we propose a
novel framework, called Heterogeneity-aware Distributional Framework (HDF), and
design two plug-and-play modules to enhance time-frequency modeling and
mitigate optimization imbalance caused by hard samples. Specifically, the
Time-Frequency Distributional Attention Module (DAM) captures both temporal
consistency and frequency robustness through a dual-branch attention design,
improving tolerance to sequence inconsistency and visual style shifts. Then,
based on gradient sensitivity and information bottleneck principles, an
adaptive optimization module Distribution-aware Scaling Module (DSM) is
introduced to dynamically balance classification and contrastive losses,
enabling more stable and discriminative representation learning. Extensive
experiments on two widely used datasets, DFEW and FERV39k, demonstrate that HDF
significantly improves both recognition accuracy and robustness. Our method
achieves superior weighted average recall (WAR) and unweighted average recall
(UAR) while maintaining strong generalization across diverse and imbalanced
scenarios. Codes are released at https://github.com/QIcita/HDF_DFER.

Motivation: 现有医学图像分割方法对所有错误同等惩罚，未能利用标签间的语义关系，尤其是当标签类别增多且差异细微时。

Result: 在头部MRI全脑分割和神经外科高光谱图像场景理解任务中达到最优性能。

Conclusion: 树状语义损失函数能有效提升医学图像分割的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Rich and accurate medical image segmentation is poised to underpin the next
generation of AI-defined clinical practice by delineating critical anatomy for
pre-operative planning, guiding real-time intra-operative navigation, and
supporting precise post-operative assessment. However, commonly used learning
methods for medical and surgical imaging segmentation tasks penalise all errors
equivalently and thus fail to exploit any inter-class semantics in the labels
space. This becomes particularly problematic as the cardinality and richness of
labels increases to include subtly different classes. In this work, we propose
two tree-based semantic loss functions which take advantage of a hierarchical
organisation of the labels. We further incorporate our losses in a recently
proposed approach for training with sparse, background-free annotations to
extend the applicability of our proposed losses. Extensive experiments are
reported on two medical and surgical image segmentation tasks, namely head MRI
for whole brain parcellation (WBP) with full supervision and neurosurgical
hyperspectral imaging (HSI) for scene understanding with sparse annotations.
Results demonstrate that our proposed method reaches state-of-the-art
performance in both cases.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种动态调整低秩适应（LoRA）的方法，通过引入稀疏正则化器自动选择任务适应的秩，显著提升了医学图像分割的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LoRA方法需要固定秩，难以适应不同医学图像任务的复杂性，因此需要一种动态调整秩的方法。

Method: 通过奇异值分解和l1稀疏正则化器动态调整低秩表示的秩，使用近端优化器优化。

Result: 在少量样本微调场景中，该方法显著优于标准LoRA和其他PEFT方法，表现出高效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 动态调整秩的方法在医学图像分割中具有显著优势，代码已开源。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) of pre-trained foundation models is
increasingly attracting interest in medical imaging due to its effectiveness
and computational efficiency. Among these methods, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)
is a notable approach based on the assumption that the adaptation inherently
occurs in a low-dimensional subspace. While it has shown good performance, its
implementation requires a fixed and unalterable rank, which might be
challenging to select given the unique complexities and requirements of each
medical imaging downstream task. Inspired by advancements in natural image
processing, we introduce a novel approach for medical image segmentation that
dynamically adjusts the intrinsic rank during adaptation. Viewing the low-rank
representation of the trainable weight matrices as a singular value
decomposition, we introduce an l_1 sparsity regularizer to the loss function,
and tackle it with a proximal optimizer. The regularizer could be viewed as a
penalty on the decomposition rank. Hence, its minimization enables to find
task-adapted ranks automatically. Our method is evaluated in a realistic
few-shot fine-tuning setting, where we compare it first to the standard LoRA
and then to several other PEFT methods across two distinguishable tasks: base
organs and novel organs. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the significant
performance improvements driven by our method, highlighting its efficiency and
robustness against suboptimal rank initialization. Our code is publicly

Abstract: The paper investigates the performance of state-of-the-art low-parameter deep
neural networks for computer vision, focusing on bottleneck architectures and
their behavior using superlinear activation functions. We address interference
in feature maps, a phenomenon associated with superposition, where neurons
simultaneously encode multiple characteristics. Our research suggests that
limiting interference can enhance scaling and accuracy in very low-scaled
networks (under 1.5M parameters). We identify key design elements that reduce
interference by examining various bottleneck architectures, leading to a more
efficient neural network. Consequently, we propose a proof-of-concept
architecture named NoDepth Bottleneck built on mechanistic insights from our
experiments, demonstrating robust scaling accuracy on the ImageNet dataset.
These findings contribute to more efficient and scalable neural networks for

Conclusion: ConformalSAM有效利用基础分割模型的能力，解决了标注数据不足的问题，提升了半监督语义分割的性能。

Abstract: Pixel-level vision tasks, such as semantic segmentation, require extensive
and high-quality annotated data, which is costly to obtain. Semi-supervised
semantic segmentation (SSSS) has emerged as a solution to alleviate the
labeling burden by leveraging both labeled and unlabeled data through
self-training techniques. Meanwhile, the advent of foundational segmentation
models pre-trained on massive data, has shown the potential to generalize
across domains effectively. This work explores whether a foundational
segmentation model can address label scarcity in the pixel-level vision task as
an annotator for unlabeled images. Specifically, we investigate the efficacy of
using SEEM, a Segment Anything Model (SAM) variant fine-tuned for textual
input, to generate predictive masks for unlabeled data. To address the
shortcomings of using SEEM-generated masks as supervision, we propose
ConformalSAM, a novel SSSS framework which first calibrates the foundation
model using the target domain's labeled data and then filters out unreliable
pixel labels of unlabeled data so that only high-confidence labels are used as
supervision. By leveraging conformal prediction (CP) to adapt foundation models
to target data through uncertainty calibration, ConformalSAM exploits the
strong capability of the foundational segmentation model reliably which
benefits the early-stage learning, while a subsequent self-reliance training
strategy mitigates overfitting to SEEM-generated masks in the later training
stage. Our experiment demonstrates that, on three standard benchmarks of SSSS,
ConformalSAM achieves superior performance compared to recent SSSS methods and
helps boost the performance of those methods as a plug-in.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前MLLMs在多模态上下文学习（MICL）中倾向于忽视视觉线索，仅依赖文本模式，导致性能受限。

Method: 提出DARA（动态注意力重分配）策略，通过调整视觉和文本标记的注意力权重，增强模型对视觉信息的关注。同时，构建TrueMICL数据集，明确要求整合多模态信息。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提升了模型在多模态上下文学习中的能力。

Conclusion: DARA和TrueMICL有效解决了MLLMs在MICL中的视觉信息利用不足问题，提升了其实际应用价值。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), built on powerful language
backbones, have enabled Multimodal In-Context Learning (MICL)-adapting to new
tasks from a few multimodal demonstrations consisting of images, questions, and
answers. Despite showing noticeable improvement on standard vision-language
datasets, current MLLMs struggle to leverage visual information in the
demonstrations. Specifically, they tend to neglect visual cues and over-rely on
textual patterns, leading to mere text imitation rather than genuine multimodal
adaptation. This behavior makes MICL still unimodal and largely restricts its
practical utility. More importantly, this limitation is often concealed by the
improved performance on tasks that do not require understanding the visual
context. As a result, how to effectively enhance MICL ability and reliably
evaluate the MICL performance remains underexplored. To address these issues,
we first introduce Dynamic Attention Reallocation (DARA), an efficient
fine-tuning strategy that encourages models to attend to the visual context by
rebalancing attention across visual and textual tokens. In addition, we present
TrueMICL, an MICL-dedicated dataset with both support and test sets that
explicitly requires the integration of multimodal information-particularly
visual content-for correct task completion. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the effectiveness of our holistic solution, showcasing substantial improvements
in the true multimodal in-context learning capabilities. Code and datasets are

Conclusion: 扩散模型在多元地下建模和概率反演中具有显著优势，适用于多种条件数据。

Abstract: Diffusion models offer stable training and state-of-the-art performance for
deep generative modeling tasks. Here, we consider their use in the context of
multivariate subsurface modeling and probabilistic inversion. We first
demonstrate that diffusion models enhance multivariate modeling capabilities
compared to variational autoencoders and generative adversarial networks. In
diffusion modeling, the generative process involves a comparatively large
number of time steps with update rules that can be modified to account for
conditioning data. We propose different corrections to the popular Diffusion
Posterior Sampling approach by Chung et al. (2023). In particular, we introduce
a likelihood approximation accounting for the noise-contamination that is
inherent in diffusion modeling. We assess performance in a multivariate
geological scenario involving facies and correlated acoustic impedance.
Conditional modeling is demonstrated using both local hard data (well logs) and
nonlinear geophysics (fullstack seismic data). Our tests show significantly
improved statistical robustness, enhanced sampling of the posterior probability
density function and reduced computational costs, compared to the original
approach. The method can be used with both hard and indirect conditioning data,
individually or simultaneously. As the inversion is included within the
diffusion process, it is faster than other methods requiring an outer-loop
around the generative model, such as Markov chain Monte Carlo.

Motivation: 当前文本到视频生成模型在物理常识方面表现不足，常违反因果关系和物体行为的基本直觉，需要一种结构化评估方法。

Method: 设计PhysVidBench基准，包括383个提示，采用三阶段评估流程：生成物理问题、视频字幕描述、语言模型回答问题。

Result: 通过间接评估策略避免了直接视频评估中的幻觉问题，突出了工具使用和物理合理性。

Conclusion: PhysVidBench为评估生成视频模型的物理常识提供了结构化、可解释的框架。

Abstract: Recent progress in text-to-video (T2V) generation has enabled the synthesis
of visually compelling and temporally coherent videos from natural language.
However, these models often fall short in basic physical commonsense, producing
outputs that violate intuitive expectations around causality, object behavior,
and tool use. Addressing this gap, we present PhysVidBench, a benchmark
designed to evaluate the physical reasoning capabilities of T2V systems. The
benchmark includes 383 carefully curated prompts, emphasizing tool use,
material properties, and procedural interactions, and domains where physical
plausibility is crucial. For each prompt, we generate videos using diverse
state-of-the-art models and adopt a three-stage evaluation pipeline: (1)
formulate grounded physics questions from the prompt, (2) caption the generated
video with a vision-language model, and (3) task a language model to answer
several physics-involved questions using only the caption. This indirect
strategy circumvents common hallucination issues in direct video-based
evaluation. By highlighting affordances and tool-mediated actions, areas
overlooked in current T2V evaluations, PhysVidBench provides a structured,
interpretable framework for assessing physical commonsense in generative video
models.

Motivation: 当前视频对象分割方法依赖外观匹配，缺乏人类对对象的概念理解，导致在视觉变化、遮挡和复杂场景变化中表现不佳。

Method: SeC框架利用LVLMs整合视觉线索，构建对象概念先验，并动态平衡语义推理与特征匹配。

Result: SeC在SeCVOS基准上比SAM 2.1提高了11.8分，实现了概念感知视频对象分割的新最优性能。

Conclusion: SeC通过概念驱动的方法显著提升了视频对象分割的鲁棒性，为复杂场景下的分割任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: Video Object Segmentation (VOS) is a core task in computer vision, requiring
models to track and segment target objects across video frames. Despite notable
advances with recent efforts, current techniques still lag behind human
capabilities in handling drastic visual variations, occlusions, and complex
scene changes. This limitation arises from their reliance on appearance
matching, neglecting the human-like conceptual understanding of objects that
enables robust identification across temporal dynamics. Motivated by this gap,
we propose Segment Concept (SeC), a concept-driven segmentation framework that
shifts from conventional feature matching to the progressive construction and
utilization of high-level, object-centric representations. SeC employs Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) to integrate visual cues across diverse frames,
constructing robust conceptual priors. During inference, SeC forms a
comprehensive semantic representation of the target based on processed frames,
realizing robust segmentation of follow-up frames. Furthermore, SeC adaptively
balances LVLM-based semantic reasoning with enhanced feature matching,
dynamically adjusting computational efforts based on scene complexity. To
rigorously assess VOS methods in scenarios demanding high-level conceptual
reasoning and robust semantic understanding, we introduce the Semantic Complex
Scenarios Video Object Segmentation benchmark (SeCVOS). SeCVOS comprises 160
manually annotated multi-scenario videos designed to challenge models with
substantial appearance variations and dynamic scene transformations. In
particular, SeC achieves an 11.8-point improvement over SAM 2.1 on SeCVOS,
establishing a new state-of-the-art in concept-aware video object segmentation.

Motivation: 现代生成模型共享类似的训练目标（从噪声输入重建干净信号），但视觉分词器的有效属性尚不明确。

Result: 在ImageNet 256x256上，l-DeTok在六种代表性生成模型中表现优于标准分词器。

Conclusion: 去噪是分词器设计的基本原则，为未来分词器设计提供了新视角。

Abstract: Despite their fundamental role, it remains unclear what properties could make
visual tokenizers more effective for generative modeling. We observe that
modern generative models share a conceptually similar training objective --
reconstructing clean signals from corrupted inputs such as Gaussian noise or
masking -- a process we term denoising. Motivated by this insight, we propose
aligning tokenizer embeddings directly with the downstream denoising objective,
encouraging latent embeddings to be more easily reconstructed even when heavily
corrupted. To achieve this, we introduce the Latent Denoising Tokenizer
(l-DeTok), a simple yet effective tokenizer trained to reconstruct clean images
from latent embeddings corrupted by interpolative noise and random masking.
Extensive experiments on ImageNet 256x256 demonstrate that our tokenizer
consistently outperforms standard tokenizers across six representative
generative models. Our findings highlight denoising as a fundamental design
principle for tokenizer development, and we hope it could motivate new
perspectives for future tokenizer design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 城市空中交通系统（UAM）需要灵活的路径规划以应对动态乘客需求和确保通信质量，而传统方法缺乏这种灵活性。

Method: 首先构建无线电地图评估通信质量，然后提出MSHA-RL框架，通过混合注意力机制平衡全局和局部信息，实现实时路径规划。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能有效减少旅行时间并提高运营效率，同时确保通信质量和乘客安全。

Conclusion: MSHA-RL框架为UAM系统提供了一种高效、灵活的路径规划解决方案，满足了动态需求和通信要求。

Abstract: Urban Air Mobility (UAM) systems are rapidly emerging as promising solutions
to alleviate urban congestion, with path planning becoming a key focus area.
Unlike ground transportation, UAM trajectory planning has to prioritize
communication quality for accurate location tracking in constantly changing
environments to ensure safety. Meanwhile, a UAM system, serving as an air taxi,
requires adaptive planning to respond to real-time passenger requests,
especially in ride-sharing scenarios where passenger demands are unpredictable
and dynamic. However, conventional trajectory planning strategies based on
predefined routes lack the flexibility to meet varied passenger ride demands.
To address these challenges, this work first proposes constructing a radio map
to evaluate the communication quality of urban airspace. Building on this, we
introduce a novel Multi-Source Hybrid Attention Reinforcement Learning
(MSHA-RL) framework for the challenge of effectively focusing on passengers and
UAM locations, which arises from the significant dimensional disparity between
the representations. This model first generates the alignment among diverse
data sources with large gap dimensions before employing hybrid attention to
balance global and local insights, thereby facilitating responsive, real-time
path planning. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the approach
enables communication-compliant trajectory planning, reducing travel time and
enhancing operational efficiency while prioritizing passenger safety.

Conclusion: 本文提出的方法首次解决了PKM配备SEA时的逆动力学二阶时间导数计算问题，为轨迹控制提供了高效工具。

Abstract: Series elastic actuators (SEA) were introduced for serial robotic arms. Their
model-based trajectory tracking control requires the second time derivatives of
the inverse dynamics solution, for which algorithms were proposed. Trajectory
control of parallel kinematics manipulators (PKM) equipped with SEAs has not
yet been pursued. Key element for this is the computationally efficient
evaluation of the second time derivative of the inverse dynamics solution. This
has not been presented in the literature, and is addressed in the present paper
for the first time. The special topology of PKM is exploited reusing the
recursive algorithms for evaluating the inverse dynamics of serial robots. A
Lie group formulation is used and all relations are derived within this
framework. Numerical results are presented for a 6-DOF Gough-Stewart platform
(as part of an exoskeleton), and for a planar PKM when a flatness-based control
scheme is applied.

Abstract: Socially assistive robots (SARs) have shown great potential for supplementing

pipelines for SARs remain limited in real-time latency, back-channeling, and
personalized speech dialogue. Toward addressing these limitations, we propose
using integrated end-to-end speech-language models (SLMs) with SARs. This work
1) evaluated the usability of an SLM-enabled SAR dialogue system through a
small user study, and 2) identified remaining limitations through study user
feedback to inform future improvements. We conducted a small within-participant
user study with university students (N = 11) whose results showed that
participants perceived an SLM-enabled SAR system as capable of providing
empathetic feedback, natural turn-taking, back-channeling, and adaptive
responses. We also found that participants reported the robot's nonverbal
behaviors as lacking variability and synchronization with conversation, and the
SLM's verbal feedback as generic and repetitive. These findings highlighted the
need for real-time robot movement synchronized with conversation, improved
prompting or fine-tuning to generate outputs better aligned with mental health
practices, and more expressive, adaptive vocal generation.

Abstract: Time-delay embedding is a technique that uses snapshots of state history over

consistent in modes and timings. We extended time-delay embeddings to generate
a linear model of two periodic hybrid systems: the bouncing pendulum and the

augmented linear quadratic regulator (LQR) which uses current and past state
history for feedback control.

Abstract: In the field of Learning from Demonstration (LfD), enabling robots to
generalize learned manipulation skills to novel scenarios for long-horizon
tasks remains challenging. Specifically, it is still difficult for robots to
adapt the learned skills to new environments with different task and motion
requirements, especially in long-horizon, multi-stage scenarios with intricate
constraints. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical framework, called
BT-TL-DMPs, that integrates Behavior Tree (BT), Temporal Logic (TL), and
Dynamical Movement Primitives (DMPs) to address this problem. Within this
framework, Signal Temporal Logic (STL) is employed to formally specify complex,
long-horizon task requirements and constraints. These STL specifications are
systematically transformed to generate reactive and modular BTs for high-level
decision-making task structure. An STL-constrained DMP optimization method is
proposed to optimize the DMP forcing term, allowing the learned motion
primitives to adapt flexibly while satisfying intricate spatiotemporal
requirements and, crucially, preserving the essential dynamics learned from
demonstrations. The framework is validated through simulations demonstrating
generalization capabilities under various STL constraints and real-world
experiments on several long-horizon robotic manipulation tasks. The results
demonstrate that the proposed framework effectively bridges the symbolic-motion
gap, enabling more reliable and generalizable autonomous manipulation for
complex robotic tasks.

*Chun-Ming Yang,Pranav A. Bhounsule*

Motivation: 在线优化控制四足机器人的运动，使其能在新场景中规划动作，但传统LMPC依赖线性化动力学方程，可能导致解的质量不佳。

Method: 结合Koopman算子理论和EDMD，在高维空间中建立线性模型，保留非线性动力学特性，并分阶段建模空中和地面接触相。

Result: 在水平和崎岖地形上实现了跳跃、小跑及步态转换（如跳跃到小跑）。

Conclusion: Koopman算子理论可用于构建四足机器人的混合模型，并在线生成多种步态及其转换，具有创新性。

Abstract: Online optimal control of quadrupedal robots would enable them to plan their
movement in novel scenarios. Linear Model Predictive Control (LMPC) has emerged
as a practical approach for real-time control. In LMPC, an optimization problem
with a quadratic cost and linear constraints is formulated over a finite
horizon and solved on the fly. However, LMPC relies on linearizing the
equations of motion (EOM), which may lead to poor solution quality. In this
paper, we use Koopman operator theory and the Extended Dynamic Mode
Decomposition (EDMD) to create a linear model of the system in high dimensional
space, thus retaining the nonlinearity of the EOM. We model the aerial phase
and ground contact phases using different linear models. Then, using LMPC, we
demonstrate bounding, trotting, and bound-to-trot and trot-to-bound gait
transitions in level and rough terrains. The main novelty is the use of Koopman
operator theory to create hybrid models of a quadrupedal system and demonstrate
the online generation of multiple gaits and gaits transitions.

Result: 在基准测试中，ProbHMI在确定性和多样性预测方面表现优异，同时验证了不确定性校准的有效性。

Conclusion: ProbHMI为风险感知决策提供了有效的工具，特别适用于需要高可靠性的应用场景。

Abstract: 3D human motion forecasting aims to enable autonomous applications.
Estimating uncertainty for each prediction (i.e., confidence based on
probability density or quantile) is essential for safety-critical contexts like
human-robot collaboration to minimize risks. However, existing diverse motion
forecasting approaches struggle with uncertainty quantification due to implicit
probabilistic representations hindering uncertainty modeling. We propose
ProbHMI, which introduces invertible networks to parameterize poses in a
disentangled latent space, enabling probabilistic dynamics modeling. A
forecasting module then explicitly predicts future latent distributions,
allowing effective uncertainty quantification. Evaluated on benchmarks, ProbHMI
achieves strong performance for both deterministic and diverse prediction while
validating uncertainty calibration, critical for risk-aware decision making.

Abstract: Safe navigation in unknown and cluttered environments remains a challenging
problem in robotics. Model Predictive Contour Control (MPCC) has shown promise
for performant obstacle avoidance by enabling precise and agile trajectory
tracking, however, existing methods lack formal safety assurances. To address
this issue, we propose a general Control Lyapunov Function (CLF) and Control
Barrier Function (CBF) enabled MPCC framework that enforces safety constraints
derived from a free-space corridor around the planned trajectory. To enhance
feasibility, we dynamically adapt the CBF parameters at runtime using a Soft
Actor-Critic (SAC) policy. The approach is validated with extensive simulations
and an experiment on mobile robot navigation in unknown cluttered environments.

Conclusion: 提出的方法在复杂环境中实现了高成功率的抓取，展示了分层强化学习和CVAE的有效性。

Abstract: This study addresses the problem of occluded grasping, where primary grasp
configurations of an object are not available due to occlusion with
environment. Simple parallel grippers often struggle with such tasks due to
limited dexterity and actuation constraints. Prior works have explored object
pose reorientation such as pivoting by utilizing extrinsic contacts between an
object and an environment feature like a wall, to make the object graspable.
However, such works often assume the presence of a short wall, and this
assumption may not always hold in real-world scenarios. If the wall available
for interaction is too large or too tall, the robot may still fail to grasp the
object even after pivoting, and the robot must combine different types of
actions to grasp. To address this, we propose a hierarchical reinforcement
learning (RL) framework. We use Q-learning to train a high-level policy that
selects the type of action expected to yield the highest reward. The selected
low-level skill then samples a specific robot action in continuous space. To
guide the robot to an appropriate location for executing the selected action,
we adopt a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE). We condition the CVAE on
the object point cloud and the skill ID, enabling it to infer a suitable
location based on the object geometry and the selected skill. To promote
generalization, we apply domain randomization during the training of low-level
skills. The RL policy is trained entirely in simulation with a box-like object
and deployed to six objects in real world. We conduct experiments to evaluate
our method and demonstrate both its generalizability and robust sim-to-real
transfer performance with promising success rates.

Motivation: 现有导航方法局限于特定机器人平台，缺乏通用性。

Method: X-Nav采用两阶段学习：1) 训练多个专家策略；2) 通过Nav-ACT蒸馏出通用策略。

Result: X-Nav在仿真和真实环境中均实现零样本迁移，性能随训练机器人数量增加而提升。

Conclusion: X-Nav展示了跨平台导航的潜力，并通过实验验证了其通用性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Existing navigation methods are primarily designed for specific robot
embodiments, limiting their generalizability across diverse robot platforms. In
this paper, we introduce X-Nav, a novel framework for end-to-end
cross-embodiment navigation where a single unified policy can be deployed
across various embodiments for both wheeled and quadrupedal robots. X-Nav
consists of two learning stages: 1) multiple expert policies are trained using
deep reinforcement learning with privileged observations on a wide range of
randomly generated robot embodiments; and 2) a single general policy is
distilled from the expert policies via navigation action chunking with
transformer (Nav-ACT). The general policy directly maps visual and
proprioceptive observations to low-level control commands, enabling
generalization to novel robot embodiments. Simulated experiments demonstrated
that X-Nav achieved zero-shot transfer to both unseen embodiments and
photorealistic environments. A scalability study showed that the performance of
X-Nav improves when trained with an increasing number of randomly generated
embodiments. An ablation study confirmed the design choices of X-Nav.
Furthermore, real-world experiments were conducted to validate the
generalizability of X-Nav in real-world environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在6-DoF抓取估计中存在小物体和传感器噪声的挑战，或依赖昂贵的3D标注和离散化问题。KGN-Pro旨在保留2D表示的效率，同时充分利用3D信息。

Method: KGN-Pro通过RGB-D图像生成关键点图和2D置信图，利用概率PnP层进行3D优化，实现端到端学习。

Result: 实验表明，KGN-Pro在抓取覆盖率和成功率上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: KGN-Pro通过结合2D和3D信息，显著提升了抓取性能，适用于高精度机器人操作任务。

Abstract: High-level robotic manipulation tasks demand flexible 6-DoF grasp estimation
to serve as a basic function. Previous approaches either directly generate
grasps from point-cloud data, suffering from challenges with small objects and
sensor noise, or infer 3D information from RGB images, which introduces
expensive annotation requirements and discretization issues. Recent methods
mitigate some challenges by retaining a 2D representation to estimate grasp
keypoints and applying Perspective-n-Point (PnP) algorithms to compute 6-DoF
poses. However, these methods are limited by their non-differentiable nature
and reliance solely on 2D supervision, which hinders the full exploitation of
rich 3D information. In this work, we present KGN-Pro, a novel grasping network
that preserves the efficiency and fine-grained object grasping of previous KGNs
while integrating direct 3D optimization through probabilistic PnP layers.
KGN-Pro encodes paired RGB-D images to generate Keypoint Map, and further
outputs a 2D confidence map to weight keypoint contributions during
re-projection error minimization. By modeling the weighted sum of squared
re-projection errors probabilistically, the network effectively transmits 3D
supervision to its 2D keypoint predictions, enabling end-to-end learning.
Experiments on both simulated and real-world platforms demonstrate that KGN-Pro
outperforms existing methods in terms of grasp cover rate and success rate.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶在决策与运动规划方面需要可靠且高效的解决方案，尤其是在联网自动驾驶车辆（CAVs）中，实现灵活安全的车道选择和精确轨迹执行仍具挑战。

Method: 采用混合专家（MoE）架构和多策略强化学习，通过门控机制协调多个专用子网络，将复杂驾驶任务分解为模块化组件。

Result: 仿真结果表明，CDGMP在车道选择和运动规划中表现可靠，提升了CAVs的适应性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: CDGMP为自动驾驶提供了一种可扩展的解决方案，其架构原则（尤其是MoE）也为其他高维决策与控制任务奠定了基础。

Abstract: Autonomous driving demands reliable and efficient solutions to closely
related problems such as decision-making and motion planning. In this work,
decision-making refers specifically to highway lane selection, while motion
planning involves generating control commands (such as speed and steering) to
reach the chosen lane. In the context of Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs),
achieving both flexible and safe lane selection alongside precise trajectory
execution remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a framework
called Cohesive Decision-Guided Motion Planning (CDGMP), which tightly
integrates decision-making and motion planning using a Mixture of Experts (MoE)
inspired architecture combined with multi-policy reinforcement learning. By
coordinating multiple specialized sub-networks through a gating mechanism, the
method decomposes the complex driving task into modular components. Each
sub-network focuses on a specific aspect of driving, improving efficiency by
activating only the most relevant modules during inference. This design also
enhances safety through modular specialization. CDGMP improves the adaptability
and robustness of CAVs across diverse traffic scenarios, offering a scalable
solution to real-world autonomy challenges. The architectural principles behind
CDGMP, especially the use of MoE, also provide a strong foundation for other
high-dimensional decision and control tasks. Simulation results (available at
https://youtu.be/_-4OXNHV0UY) demonstrate reliable performance in both lane
selection and motion planning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有平面规划方法难以与后续物理设计阶段集成，导致模块内组件布局和模块间馈通不理想。

Method: Flora分三阶段：1) 粗粒度优化HPWL和馈通；2) 固定轮廓下零空白布局；3) 快速树搜索组件布局并调整模块边界。

Result: 实验显示，Flora在HPWL、FTpin、FTmod和组件布局性能上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Flora通过跨阶段优化，显著提升平面规划效果。

Abstract: Floorplanning determines the shapes and locations of modules on a chip canvas
and plays a critical role in optimizing the chip's Power, Performance, and Area
(PPA) metrics. However, existing floorplanning approaches often fail to
integrate with subsequent physical design stages, leading to suboptimal
in-module component placement and excessive inter-module feedthrough. To tackle
this challenge, we propose Flora, a three-stage feedthrough and placement aware
rectilinear floorplanner. In the first stage, Flora employs wiremask and
position mask techniques to achieve coarse-grained optimization of HPWL and
feedthrough. In the second stage, under the constraint of a fixed outline,
Flora achieves a zero-whitespace layout by locally resizing module shapes,
thereby performing fine-grained optimization of feedthrough and improving
component placement. In the third stage, Flora utilizes a fast tree
search-based method to efficiently place components-including macros and
standard cells-within each module, subsequently adjusting module boundaries
based on the placement results to enable cross-stage optimization. Experimental
results show that Flora outperforms recent state-of-the-art floorplanning
approaches, achieving an average reduction of 6% in HPWL, 5.16% in FTpin,
29.15% in FTmod, and a 14% improvement in component placement performance.

Abstract: Disassembling and sorting Electric Vehicle Batteries (EVBs) supports a
sustainable transition to electric vehicles by enabling a closed-loop supply
chain. Currently, the manual disassembly process exposes workers to hazards,
including electrocution and toxic chemicals. We propose a teleoperated system
for the safe disassembly and sorting of EVBs. A human-in-the-loop can create
and save disassembly sequences for unknown EVB types, enabling future
automation. An RGB camera aligns the physical and digital twins of the EVB, and
the digital twin of the robot is based on the Robot Operating System (ROS)
middleware. This hybrid approach combines teleoperation and automation to
improve safety, adaptability, and efficiency in EVB disassembly and sorting.
The economic contribution is realized by reducing labor dependency and
increasing throughput in battery recycling. An online pilot study was set up to
evaluate the usability of the presented approach, and the results demonstrate
the potential as a user-friendly solution.

Abstract: Forensic mental health care involves the treatment of individuals with severe
mental disorders who have committed violent offences. These settings are often
characterized by high levels of bureaucracy, risk avoidance, and restricted
autonomy. Patients frequently experience a profound loss of control over their
lives, leading to heightened psychological stress-sometimes resulting in
isolation as a safety measure. In this study, we explore how co-design can be
used to collaboratively develop a companion robot that helps monitor and
regulate stress while maintaining tracking of the patients' interaction
behaviours for long-term intervention. We conducted four co-design workshops in
a forensic psychiatric clinic with patients, caregivers, and therapists. Our
process began with the presentation of an initial speculative prototype to
therapists, enabling reflection on shared concerns, ethical risks, and
desirable features. This was followed by a creative ideation session with
patients, a third workshop focused on defining desired functions and emotional
responses, and we are planning a final prototype demo to gather direct patient
feedback. Our findings emphasize the importance of empowering patients in the
design process and adapting proposals based on their current emotional state.
The goal was to empower the patient in the design process and ensure each
patient's voice was heard.

Abstract: Manipulation surfaces indirectly control and reposition objects by actively
modifying their shape or properties rather than directly gripping objects.
These surfaces, equipped with dense actuator arrays, generate dynamic
deformations. However, a high-density actuator array introduces considerable
complexity due to increased degrees of freedom (DOF), complicating control
tasks. High DOF restrict the implementation and utilization of manipulation
surfaces in real-world applications as the maintenance and control of such
systems exponentially increase with array/surface size. Learning-based control
approaches may ease the control complexity, but they require extensive training
samples and struggle to generalize for heterogeneous objects. In this study, we
introduce a simple, precise and robust PID-based linear close-loop feedback
control strategy for heterogeneous object manipulation on MANTA-RAY
(Manipulation with Adaptive Non-rigid Textile Actuation with Reduced Actuation
density). Our approach employs a geometric transformation-driven PID
controller, directly mapping tilt angle control outputs(1D/2D) to actuator
commands to eliminate the need for extensive black-box training. We validate
the proposed method through simulations and experiments on a physical system,
successfully manipulating objects with diverse geometries, weights and
textures, including fragile objects like eggs and apples. The outcomes
demonstrate that our approach is highly generalized and offers a practical and
reliable solution for object manipulation on soft robotic manipulation,
facilitating real-world implementation without prohibitive training demands.

Abstract: Autonomous error correction is critical for domestic robots to achieve
reliable execution of complex long-horizon tasks. Prior work has explored
self-reflection in Large Language Models (LLMs) for task planning error
correction; however, existing methods are constrained by inflexible
self-reflection mechanisms that limit their effectiveness. Motivated by these
limitations and inspired by human cognitive adaptation, we propose the Flexible
Constructivism Reflection Framework (FCRF), a novel Mentor-Actor architecture
that enables LLMs to perform flexible self-reflection based on task difficulty,
while constructively integrating historical valuable experience with failure
lessons. We evaluated FCRF on diverse domestic tasks through simulation in
AlfWorld and physical deployment in the real-world environment. Experimental
results demonstrate that FCRF significantly improves overall performance and
self-reflection flexibility in complex long-horizon robotic tasks.

Result: 在点质量系统和非完整模型上验证了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: CPED-NCBF策略能够有效验证学习到的NCBF的安全性，克服了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Among the promising approaches to enforce safety in control systems, learning
Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) from expert demonstrations has emerged as an
effective strategy. However, a critical challenge remains: verifying that the
learned CBFs truly enforce safety across the entire state space. This is
especially difficult when CBF is represented using neural networks (NCBFs).
Several existing verification techniques attempt to address this problem
including SMT-based solvers, mixed-integer programming (MIP), and interval or
bound-propagation methods but these approaches often introduce loose,
conservative bounds. To overcome these limitations, in this work we use
CPED-NCBFs a split-conformal prediction based verification strategy to verify
the learned NCBF from the expert demonstrations. We further validate our method
on point mass systems and unicycle models to demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed theory.

Abstract: Handheld grippers are increasingly used to collect human demonstrations due
to their ease of deployment and versatility. However, most existing designs
lack tactile sensing, despite the critical role of tactile feedback in precise
manipulation. We present a portable, lightweight gripper with integrated
tactile sensors that enables synchronized collection of visual and tactile data
in diverse, real-world, and in-the-wild settings. Building on this hardware, we
propose a cross-modal representation learning framework that integrates visual
and tactile signals while preserving their distinct characteristics. The
learning procedure allows the emergence of interpretable representations that
consistently focus on contacting regions relevant for physical interactions.
When used for downstream manipulation tasks, these representations enable more
efficient and effective policy learning, supporting precise robotic
manipulation based on multimodal feedback. We validate our approach on
fine-grained tasks such as test tube insertion and pipette-based fluid
transfer, demonstrating improved accuracy and robustness under external
disturbances. Our project page is available at

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a search-based interactive motion planning scheme
for autonomous vehicles (AVs), using a game-theoretic approach. In contrast to
traditional search-based approaches, the newly developed approach considers
other road users (e.g. drivers and pedestrians) as intelligent agents rather
than static obstacles. This leads to the generation of a more realistic path
for the AV. Due to the low computational time, the proposed motion planning
scheme is implementable in real-time applications. The performance of the
developed motion planning scheme is compared with existing motion planning
techniques and validated through experiments using WATonoBus, an electrical
all-weather autonomous shuttle bus.

Abstract: This letter introduces a novel learning-based modeling framework for a
magnetically steerable soft suction device designed for endoscopic endonasal
brain tumor resection. The device is miniaturized (4 mm outer diameter, 2 mm
inner diameter, 40 mm length), 3D printed using biocompatible SIL 30 material,
and integrates embedded Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) sensors for real-time shape
feedback. Shape reconstruction is represented using four Bezier control points,
enabling a compact and smooth model of the device's deformation. A data-driven
model was trained on 5,097 experimental samples covering a range of magnetic
field magnitudes (0-14 mT), actuation frequencies (0.2-1.0 Hz), and vertical
tip distances (90-100 mm), using both Neural Network (NN) and Random Forest
(RF) architectures. The RF model outperformed the NN across all metrics,
achieving a mean root mean square error of 0.087 mm in control point prediction
and a mean shape reconstruction error of 0.064 mm. Feature importance analysis
further revealed that magnetic field components predominantly influence distal
control points, while frequency and distance affect the base configuration.
This learning-based approach effectively models the complex nonlinear behavior
of hyperelastic soft robots under magnetic actuation without relying on
simplified physical assumptions. By enabling sub-millimeter shape prediction
accuracy and real-time inference, this work represents an advancement toward
the intelligent control of magnetically actuated soft robotic tools in
minimally invasive neurosurgery.

Abstract: Depth information which specifies the distance between objects and current
position of the robot is essential for many robot tasks such as navigation.
Recently, researchers have proposed depth completion frameworks to provide
dense depth maps that offer comprehensive information about the surrounding
environment. However, existing methods show significant trade-offs between
computational efficiency and accuracy during inference. The substantial memory
and computational requirements make them unsuitable for real-time applications,
highlighting the need to improve the completeness and accuracy of depth
information while improving processing speed to enhance robot performance in
various tasks. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose
CHADET(cross-hierarchical-attention depth-completion transformer), a
lightweight depth-completion network that can generate accurate dense depth
maps from RGB images and sparse depth points. For each pair, its feature is
extracted from the depthwise blocks and passed to the equally lightweight
transformer-based decoder. In the decoder, we utilize the novel
cross-hierarchical-attention module that refines the image features from the
depth information. Our approach improves the quality and reduces memory usage
of the depth map prediction, as validated in both KITTI, NYUv2, and VOID
datasets.

Conclusion: VLM-UDMC成功结合场景理解和注意力分解，优化了自动驾驶决策。

Abstract: Scene understanding and risk-aware attentions are crucial for human drivers
to make safe and effective driving decisions. To imitate this cognitive ability
in urban autonomous driving while ensuring the transparency and
interpretability, we propose a vision-language model (VLM)-enhanced unified
decision-making and motion control framework, named VLM-UDMC. This framework
incorporates scene reasoning and risk-aware insights into an upper-level slow
system, which dynamically reconfigures the optimal motion planning for the
downstream fast system. The reconfiguration is based on real-time environmental
changes, which are encoded through context-aware potential functions. More
specifically, the upper-level slow system employs a two-step reasoning policy
with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), leveraging foundation models to
process multimodal inputs and retrieve contextual knowledge, thereby generating
risk-aware insights. Meanwhile, a lightweight multi-kernel decomposed LSTM
provides real-time trajectory predictions for heterogeneous traffic
participants by extracting smoother trend representations for short-horizon
trajectory prediction. The effectiveness of the proposed VLM-UDMC framework is
verified via both simulations and real-world experiments with a full-size
autonomous vehicle. It is demonstrated that the presented VLM-UDMC effectively
leverages scene understanding and attention decomposition for rational driving
decisions, thus improving the overall urban driving performance. Our
open-source project is available at https://github.com/henryhcliu/vlmudmc.git.

Motivation: 惯性定位因其成本效益和独立性成为物联网设备的理想定位方案，但现有方法依赖复杂网络架构且忽略长期依赖建模，限制了性能。

Method: 采用多分支训练结构转换为单路径推理架构，引入时间尺度稀疏注意力机制和门控卷积单元以捕获长期依赖和局部特征。

Result: 在RoNIN数据集上，绝对轨迹误差降低2.59%，参数数量减少3.86%。

Conclusion: 该方法在精度和模型紧凑性之间取得了良好平衡，适用于资源受限的物联网设备。

Abstract: Inertial localization is regarded as a promising positioning solution for
consumer-grade IoT devices due to its cost-effectiveness and independence from
external infrastructure. However, data-driven inertial localization methods
often rely on increasingly complex network architectures to improve accuracy,
which challenges the limited computational resources of IoT devices. Moreover,
these methods frequently overlook the importance of modeling long-term
dependencies in inertial measurements - a critical factor for accurate
trajectory reconstruction - thereby limiting localization performance. To
address these challenges, we propose a reparameterized inertial localization
network that uses a multi-branch structure during training to enhance feature
extraction. At inference time, this structure is transformed into an equivalent
single-path architecture to improve parameter efficiency. To further capture
long-term dependencies in motion trajectories, we introduce a temporal-scale
sparse attention mechanism that selectively emphasizes key trajectory segments
while suppressing noise. Additionally, a gated convolutional unit is
incorporated to effectively integrate long-range dependencies with local
fine-grained features. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks demonstrate
that our method achieves a favorable trade-off between accuracy and model
compactness. For example, on the RoNIN dataset, our approach reduces the
Absolute Trajectory Error (ATE) by 2.59% compared to RoNIN-ResNet while
reducing the number of parameters by 3.86%.

Conclusion: 为复杂气动环境飞行研究开辟新方向，同时揭示了管道飞行中的特征流结构，结合了机器人学和流体动力学。

Abstract: Autonomous quadrotor flight in confined spaces such as pipes and tunnels
presents significant challenges due to unsteady, self-induced aerodynamic
disturbances. Very recent advances have enabled flight in such conditions, but
they either rely on constant motion through the pipe to mitigate airflow
recirculation effects or suffer from limited stability during hovering. In this
work, we present the first closed-loop control system for quadrotors for
hovering in narrow pipes that leverages real-time flow field measurements. We
develop a low-latency, event-based smoke velocimetry method that estimates
local airflow at high temporal resolution. This flow information is used by a
disturbance estimator based on a recurrent convolutional neural network, which
infers force and torque disturbances in real time. The estimated disturbances
are integrated into a learning-based controller trained via reinforcement
learning. The flow-feedback control proves particularly effective during
lateral translation maneuvers in the pipe cross-section. There, the real-time
disturbance information enables the controller to effectively counteract
transient aerodynamic effects, thereby preventing collisions with the pipe
wall. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first
demonstration of an aerial robot with closed-loop control informed by real-time
flow field measurements. This opens new directions for research on flight in
aerodynamically complex environments. In addition, our work also sheds light on
the characteristic flow structures that emerge during flight in narrow,
circular pipes, providing new insights at the intersection of robotics and
fluid dynamics.

both learning-based adaptability and deterministic reliability, offering
promising directions for robust and resilient autonomous navigation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在恶劣环境（如烟雾、灰尘）中，光学传感器容易失效，而UWB雷达因其低频成分能够穿透这些环境，成为SLAM的潜在传感技术。然而，现有方法受限于环境中可区分特征的数量。

Method: 通过动态部署UWB锚点-标签单元获取AOA测量，并将其整合到UWB雷达SLAM系统中，以解决特征缺失问题。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了UWB雷达SLAM在特征缺失环境中的局限性，提高了系统的准确性和可扩展性。

Abstract: There has been a growing interest in autonomous systems designed to operate
in adverse conditions (e.g. smoke, dust), where the visible light spectrum
fails. In this context, Ultra-wideband (UWB) radar is capable of penetrating
through such challenging environmental conditions due to the lower frequency
components within its broad bandwidth. Therefore, UWB radar has emerged as a
potential sensing technology for Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)
in vision-denied environments where optical sensors (e.g. LiDAR, Camera) are
prone to failure. Existing approaches involving UWB radar as the primary
exteroceptive sensor generally extract features in the environment, which are
later initialized as landmarks in a map. However, these methods are constrained
by the number of distinguishable features in the environment. Hence, this paper
proposes a novel method incorporating UWB Angle of Arrival (AOA) measurements
into UWB radar-based SLAM systems to improve the accuracy and scalability of
SLAM in feature-deficient environments. The AOA measurements are obtained using
UWB anchor-tag units which are dynamically deployed by the robot in featureless
areas during mapping of the environment. This paper thoroughly discusses
prevailing constraints associated with UWB AOA measurement units and presents
solutions to overcome them. Our experimental results show that integrating UWB
AOA units with UWB radar enables SLAM in vision-denied feature-deficient
environments.

Abstract: Ensuring reliable and rule-compliant behavior of autonomous agents in
uncertain environments remains a fundamental challenge in modern robotics. Our
work shows how neuro-symbolic systems, which integrate probabilistic, symbolic
white-box reasoning models with deep learning methods, offer a powerful
solution to this challenge. This enables the simultaneous consideration of
explicit rules and neural models trained on noisy data, combining the strength
of structured reasoning with flexible representations. To this end, we
introduce the Constitutional Controller (CoCo), a novel framework designed to
enhance the safety and reliability of agents by reasoning over deep
probabilistic logic programs representing constraints such as those found in
shared traffic spaces. Furthermore, we propose the concept of self-doubt,
implemented as a probability density conditioned on doubt features such as
travel velocity, employed sensors, or health factors. In a real-world aerial
mobility study, we demonstrate CoCo's advantages for intelligent autonomous
systems to learn appropriate doubts and navigate complex and uncertain
environments safely and compliantly.

Abstract: This research was a part of a project that developed mobile robots that
performed targeted pollen spraying and automated harvesting in pergola
structured kiwifruit orchards. Multiple kiwifruit detachment mechanisms were
designed and field testing of one of the concepts showed that the mechanism
could reliably pick kiwifruit. Furthermore, this kiwifruit detachment mechanism
was able to reach over 80 percent of fruit in the cluttered kiwifruit canopy,
whereas the previous state of the art mechanism was only able to reach less
than 70 percent of the fruit. Artificial pollination was performed by detecting
flowers and then spraying pollen in solution onto the detected flowers from a
line of sprayers on a boom, while driving at up to 1.4 ms-1. In addition, the
height of the canopy was measured and the spray boom was moved up and down to
keep the boom close enough to the flowers for the spray to reach the flowers,
while minimising collisions with the canopy. Mobile robot navigation was
performed using a 2D lidar in apple orchards and vineyards. Lidar navigation in
kiwifruit orchards was more challenging because the pergola structure only
provides a small amount of data for the direction of rows, compared to the
amount of data from the overhead canopy, the undulating ground and other
objects in the orchards. Multiple methods are presented here for extracting
structure defining features from 3D lidar data in kiwifruit orchards. In
addition, a 3D lidar navigation system -- which performed row following, row
end detection and row end turns -- was tested for over 30 km of autonomous
driving in kiwifruit orchards. Computer vision algorithms for row detection and
row following were also tested. The computer vision algorithm worked as well as
the 3D lidar row following method in testing.

Abstract: We report our recent progress towards building generalist robot policies, the

It showcases exceptional capabilities in generalizing to novel objects,

be efficiently fine-tuned with minimal human trajectory data, enabling rapid
and cost-effective adaptation to new settings. GR-3 also excels in handling
long-horizon and dexterous tasks, including those requiring bi-manual
manipulation and mobile movement, showcasing robust and reliable performance.
These capabilities are achieved through a multi-faceted training recipe that
includes co-training with web-scale vision-language data, efficient fine-tuning
from human trajectory data collected via VR devices, and effective imitation
learning with robot trajectory data. In addition, we introduce ByteMini, a
versatile bi-manual mobile robot designed with exceptional flexibility and
reliability, capable of accomplishing a wide range of tasks when integrated
with GR-3. Through extensive real-world experiments, we show GR-3 surpasses the
state-of-the-art baseline method, $\pi_0$, on a wide variety of challenging
tasks. We hope GR-3 can serve as a step towards building generalist robots
capable of assisting humans in daily life.

enabler herein is our Bayesian formulation that encodes domain knowledge

demonstrate its capabilities with a user validation study as well as
experiments on humanoid and deformable objects. To our knowledge, we are the
first to realize stream-based active learning on a real robot, providing
evidence that the robustness of the DNN-based semantic perception can be
improved in practice. The project website can be accessed at

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种无需专用负载惯性参数（PIP）校准的方法，通过非接触运动部分估计PIP，使非专家用户能更高效地编程接触运动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着协作机器人（cobot）的普及，需要为非编程背景用户提供高效操作方式，尤其是接触运动的编程。传统方法依赖PIP校准，限制了工具的灵活性。

Method: 利用任务中的非接触运动部分，通过已有估计技术计算PIP，避免专用校准。

Result: 质量估计准确，但质心和惯性张量受噪声和激励不足影响。

Conclusion: 该方法在手动引导中估计PIP可行，但需足够负载加速度以提高精度。

Abstract: As the availability of cobots increases, it is essential to address the needs
of users with little to no programming knowledge to operate such systems
efficiently. Programming concepts often use intuitive interaction modalities,
such as hand guiding, to address this. When programming in-contact motions,
such frameworks require knowledge of the robot tool's payload inertial
parameters (PIP) in addition to the demonstrated velocities and forces to
ensure effective hybrid motion-force control. This paper aims to enable
non-expert users to program in-contact motions more efficiently by eliminating
the need for a dedicated PIP calibration, thereby enabling flexible robot tool
changes. Since demonstrated tasks generally also contain motions with
non-contact, our approach uses these parts to estimate the robot's PIP using
established estimation techniques. The results show that the estimation of the
payload's mass is accurate, whereas the center of mass and the inertia tensor
are affected by noise and a lack of excitation. Overall, these findings show
the feasibility of PIP estimation during hand guiding but also highlight the
need for sufficient payload accelerations for an accurate estimation.

Abstract: Autonomous navigation of vehicle-trailer systems is crucial in environments
like airports, supermarkets, and concert venues, where various types of
trailers are needed to navigate with different payloads and conditions.
However, accurately modeling such systems remains challenging, especially for
trailers with castor wheels. In this work, we propose a novel universal
vehicle-trailer navigation system that integrates a hybrid nominal kinematic
model--combining classical nonholonomic constraints for vehicles and neural
network-based trailer kinematics--with a lightweight online residual learning
module to correct real-time modeling discrepancies and disturbances.
Additionally, we develop a model predictive control framework with a weighted
model combination strategy that improves long-horizon prediction accuracy and
ensures safer motion planning. Our approach is validated through extensive
real-world experiments involving multiple trailer types and varying payload
conditions, demonstrating robust performance without manual tuning or
trailer-specific calibration.

Abstract: For non-robot-programming experts, kinesthetic guiding can be an intuitive
input method, as robot programming of in-contact tasks is becoming more
prominent. However, imprecise and noisy input signals from human demonstrations
pose problems when reproducing motions directly or using the signal as input
for machine learning methods. This paper explores optimizing force signals to
correspond better to the human intention of the demonstrated signal. We compare
different signal filtering methods and propose a peak detection method for
dealing with first-contact deviations in the signal. The evaluation of these
methods considers a specialized error criterion between the input and the
human-intended signal. In addition, we analyze the critical parameters'
influence on the filtering methods. The quality for an individual motion could
be increased by up to \SI{20}{\percent} concerning the error criterion. The
proposed contribution can improve the usability of robot programming and the
interaction between humans and robots.

Abstract: To support humanoid robots in performing manipulation tasks, it is essential
to study stable standing while accommodating upper-body motions. However, the
limited controllable range of humanoid robots in a standing position affects
the stability of the entire body. Thus we introduce a reinforcement learning
based framework for humanoid robots to imitate human upper-body motions while
maintaining overall stability. Our approach begins with designing a retargeting
network that generates a large-scale upper-body motion dataset for training the
reinforcement learning (RL) policy, which enables the humanoid robot to track
upper-body motion targets, employing domain randomization for enhanced
robustness. To avoid exceeding the robot's execution capability and ensure
safety and stability, we propose an Executable Motion Prior (EMP) module, which
adjusts the input target movements based on the robot's current state. This
adjustment improves standing stability while minimizing changes to motion
amplitude. We evaluate our framework through simulation and real-world tests,
demonstrating its practical applicability.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于输入输出数据的模型预测控制（MPC）方法，用于提高柔性电缆驱动机械臂（FCRA）的控制精度，无需物理模型。通过数据选择算法（DSA）优化计算时间，并在实验中验证了其性能。


<details>

Motivation: 柔性电缆驱动机械臂（FCRA）的电缆特性（如弹性、滞后和摩擦）导致建模和控制困难，需要一种无需物理模型的高精度控制方法。

Result: 实验验证表明，平均定位精度为2.070 mm，平均跟踪误差为0.541°，优于PID方法的1.418°。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了FCRA的控制精度和计算效率，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Flexible cable-driven robotic arms (FCRAs) offer dexterous and compliant
motion. Still, the inherent properties of cables, such as resilience,
hysteresis, and friction, often lead to particular difficulties in modeling and
control. This paper proposes a model predictive control (MPC) method that
relies exclusively on input-output data, without a physical model, to improve
the control accuracy of FCRAs. First, we develop an implicit model based on
input-output data and integrate it into an MPC optimization framework. Second,
a data selection algorithm (DSA) is introduced to filter the data that best
characterize the system, thereby reducing the solution time per step to
approximately 4 ms, which is an improvement of nearly 80%. Lastly, the
influence of hyperparameters on tracking error is investigated through
simulation. The proposed method has been validated on a real FCRA platform,
including five-point positioning accuracy tests, a five-point response tracking
test, and trajectory tracking for letter drawing. The results demonstrate that
the average positioning accuracy is approximately 2.070 mm. Moreover, compared
to the PID method with an average tracking error of 1.418{\deg}, the proposed
method achieves an average tracking error of 0.541{\deg}.

Motivation: 现有采样算法在复杂配置空间中效率低，且启发式方法缺乏通用性或需要大量训练。

Result: 在多种配置空间和机器人实验中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 所提方法在复杂环境中高效且通用，适用于多种运动规划场景。

Abstract: Sampling-based algorithms are widely used for motion planning in
high-dimensional configuration spaces. However, due to low sampling efficiency,
their performance often diminishes in complex configuration spaces with narrow
corridors. Existing approaches address this issue using handcrafted or learned
heuristics to guide sampling toward useful regions. Unfortunately, these
strategies often lack generalizability to various problems or require extensive
prior training. In this paper, we propose a simple yet efficient sampling-based
planning framework along with its bidirectional version that overcomes these
issues by integrating different levels of planning granularity. Our approach
probes configuration spaces with uniform random samples at varying resolutions
and explores these multi-resolution samples online with a bias towards sparse
samples when traveling large free configuration spaces. By seamlessly
transitioning between sparse and dense samples, our approach can navigate
complex configuration spaces while maintaining planning speed and completeness.
The simulation results demonstrate that our approach outperforms several
state-of-the-art sampling-based planners in $\mathbb{SE}(2)$, $\mathbb{SE}(3)$,
and $\mathbb{R}^{14}$ with challenging terrains. Furthermore, experiments
conducted with the Franka Emika Panda robot operating in a constrained
workspace provide additional evidence of the superiority of the proposed
method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统可微分粒子滤波器依赖预定义或低容量提议分布，限制了性能。DiffPF旨在通过扩散模型学习灵活的后验采样器。

Method: DiffPF通过扩散模型在预测粒子和当前观测条件下学习后验采样器，支持复杂高维多模态分布的精确采样。

Result: 在多种场景下测试，DiffPF表现优异，例如在多模态全局定位基准上提升82.8%，在KITTI视觉测距基准上提升26%。

Conclusion: DiffPF首次将条件扩散模型融入粒子滤波，显著提升状态估计质量。

Abstract: This paper proposes DiffPF, a differentiable particle filter that leverages
diffusion models for state estimation in dynamic systems. Unlike conventional
differentiable particle filters, which require importance weighting and
typically rely on predefined or low-capacity proposal distributions. DiffPF
learns a flexible posterior sampler by conditioning a diffusion model on
predicted particles and the current observation. This enables accurate,
equally-weighted sampling from complex, high-dimensional, and multimodal
filtering distributions. We evaluate DiffPF across a range of scenarios,
including both unimodal and highly multimodal distributions, and test it on
simulated as well as real-world tasks, where it consistently outperforms
existing filtering baselines. In particular, DiffPF achieves an 82.8%
improvement in estimation accuracy on a highly multimodal global localization
benchmark, and a 26% improvement on the real-world KITTI visual odometry
benchmark, compared to state-of-the-art differentiable filters. To the best of
our knowledge, DiffPF is the first method to integrate conditional diffusion
models into particle filtering, enabling high-quality posterior sampling that
produces more informative particles and significantly improves state
estimation.

Abstract: The rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs) creates an exciting
potential for flexible, general knowledge-driven Human-Robot Interaction (HRI)
systems for assistive robots. Existing HRI systems demonstrate great progress
in interpreting and following user instructions, action generation, and robot
task solving. On the other hand, bi-directional, multi-modal, and context-aware
support of the user in collaborative tasks still remains an open challenge. In
this paper, we present a gaze- and speech-informed interface to the assistive
robot, which is able to perceive the working environment from multiple vision
inputs and support the dynamic user in their tasks. Our system is designed to
be modular and transferable to adapt to diverse tasks and robots, and it is
capable of real-time use of language-based interaction state representation and
fast on board perception modules. Its development was supported by multiple
public dissemination events, contributing important considerations for improved
robustness and user experience. Furthermore, in two lab studies, we compare the
performance and user ratings of our system with those of a traditional scripted
HRI pipeline. Our findings indicate that an LLM-based approach enhances
adaptability and marginally improves user engagement and task execution metrics
but may produce redundant output, while a scripted pipeline is well suited for
more straightforward tasks.

Conclusion: Inter-LLM算法在多对象收集任务中表现出色，为家庭机器人的智能规划提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Household robots have been a longstanding research topic, but they still lack
human-like intelligence, particularly in manipulating open-set objects and
navigating large environments efficiently and accurately. To push this
boundary, we consider a generalized multi-object collection problem in large
scene graphs, where the robot needs to pick up and place multiple objects
across multiple locations in a long mission of multiple human commands. This
problem is extremely challenging since it requires long-horizon planning in a
vast action-state space under high uncertainties. To this end, we propose a
novel interleaved LLM and motion planning algorithm Inter-LLM. By designing a
multimodal action cost similarity function, our algorithm can both reflect the
history and look into the future to optimize plans, striking a good balance of
quality and efficiency. Simulation experiments demonstrate that compared with
latest works, our algorithm improves the overall mission performance by 30% in
terms of fulfilling human commands, maximizing mission success rates, and
minimizing mission costs.

Conclusion: 人类视觉处理机制为机器人视觉系统提供了有效的归纳偏差，显著提升了性能和效率。

Abstract: Human vision is a highly active process driven by gaze, which directs
attention and fixation to task-relevant regions and dramatically reduces visual
processing. In contrast, robot learning systems typically rely on passive,
uniform processing of raw camera images. In this work, we explore how
incorporating human-like active gaze into robotic policies can enhance both
efficiency and performance. We build on recent advances in foveated image
processing and apply them to an Active Vision robot system that emulates both
human head movement and eye tracking. Extending prior work on the AV-ALOHA
robot simulation platform, we introduce a framework for simultaneously
collecting eye-tracking data and robot demonstrations from a human operator as
well as a simulation benchmark and dataset for training robot policies that
incorporate human gaze. Given the widespread use of Vision Transformers (ViTs)
in robot learning, we integrate gaze information into ViTs using a foveated
patch tokenization scheme inspired by recent work in image segmentation.
Compared to uniform patch tokenization, this significantly reduces the number
of tokens-and thus computation-without sacrificing visual fidelity near regions
of interest. We also explore two approaches to gaze imitation and prediction
from human data. The first is a two-stage model that predicts gaze to guide
foveation and action; the second integrates gaze into the action space,
allowing the policy to jointly predict gaze and actions end-to-end. Our results
show that our method for foveated robot vision not only drastically reduces
computational overhead, but also improves performance for high precision tasks
and robustness to unseen distractors. Together, these findings suggest that
human-inspired visual processing offers a useful inductive bias for robotic
vision systems. https://ian-chuang.github.io/gaze-av-aloha/

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统剪枝方法（如L1或Group Lasso）存在幅度偏差和决策边界不稳定的问题，影响剪枝效果。

Method: 基于代数条件设计Catalyst正则化，利用辅助变量扩展参数空间，实现公平剪枝和宽裕决策边界。

Result: 实验验证了Catalyst剪枝算法在多种数据集和模型上的优越性，表现出鲁棒性和公平性。

Conclusion: Catalyst正则化解决了传统剪枝方法的局限性，提供了一种更优的剪枝策略。

Abstract: Structured pruning aims to reduce the size and computational cost of deep
neural networks by removing entire filters or channels. The traditional
regularizers such as L1 or Group Lasso and its variants lead to
magnitude-biased pruning decisions, such that the filters with small magnitudes
are likely to be pruned. Also, they often entail pruning results with almost
zero margin around pruning decision boundary, such that tiny perturbation in a
filter magnitude can flip the pruning decision. In this paper, we identify the
precise algebraic condition under which pruning operations preserve model
performance, and use the condition to construct a novel regularizer defined in
an extended parameter space via auxiliary catalyst variables. The proposed
Catalyst regularization ensures fair pruning chance for each filters with
theoretically provable zero bias to their magnitude and robust pruning behavior
achieved by wide-margin bifurcation of magnitudes between the preserved and the
pruned filters. The theoretical properties naturally lead to real-world
effectiveness, as shown by empirical validations of Catalyst Pruning algorithm.
Pruning results on various datasets and models are superior to state-of-the-art
filter pruning methods, and at the same time confirm the predicted robust and
fair pruning characteristics of Catalyst pruning.

Motivation: 传统基于幅度的剪枝方法限制了剪枝决策的能力，即使冗余滤波器也可能因幅度较大而未被剪枝。本文旨在提供公平的剪枝机会，挑战幅度主导效应。

Method: 将滤波器置于投影空间，通过观察梯度下降运动方向（是否朝向原点）来衡量其剪枝可能性，构建PROscore作为重要性评分，提出IPPRO剪枝方法。

Result: 实验表明，基于投影空间的重要性标准实现了近乎无损的剪枝，减少了性能下降，并在微调后表现出色。

Conclusion: 本文打破了剪枝中“大小决定一切”的迷思，从理论和实证上拓展了基于重要性的剪枝方法。

Abstract: With the growth of demand on neural network compression methods, the
structured pruning methods including importance-based approach are actively
studied. The magnitude importance and many correlated modern importance
criteria often limit the capacity of pruning decision, since the filters with
larger magnitudes are not likely to be pruned if the smaller one didn't, even
if it is redundant. In this paper, we propose a novel pruning strategy to
challenge this dominating effect of magnitude and provide fair chance to each
filter to be pruned, by placing it on projective space. After that, we observe
the gradient descent movement whether the filters move toward the origin or
not, to measure how the filter is likely to be pruned. This measurement is used
to construct PROscore, a novel importance score for IPPRO, a novel
importance-based structured pruning with magnitude-indifference. Our evaluation
results shows that the proposed importance criteria using the projective space
achieves near-lossless pruning by reducing the performance drop in pruning,
with promising performance after the finetuning. Our work debunks the
``size-matters'' myth in pruning and expands the frontier of importance-based
pruning both theoretically and empirically.

Abstract: Many program synthesis tasks prove too challenging for even state-of-the-art
language models to solve in single attempts. Search-based evolutionary methods
offer a promising alternative by exploring solution spaces iteratively, but
their effectiveness remain limited by the fixed capabilities of the underlying
generative model.
  We propose SOAR, a method that learns program synthesis by integrating
language models into a self-improving evolutionary loop.
  SOAR alternates between (1) an evolutionary search that uses an LLM to sample
and refine candidate solutions, and (2) a hindsight learning phase that
converts search attempts into valid problem-solution pairs used to fine-tune
the LLM's sampling and refinement capabilities\, -- \,enabling increasingly
effective search in subsequent iterations.
  On the challenging ARC-AGI benchmark, SOAR achieves significant performance
gains across model scales and iterations, leveraging positive transfer between
the sampling and refinement finetuning tasks. These improvements carry over to
test-time adaptation, enabling SOAR to solve 52\% of the public test set. Our

Motivation: 传统预测模型在精神疾病早期检测和个性化干预中表现不足，需要更先进的多模态数据整合方法以提高准确性和临床实用性。

Method: 使用BRIGHTEN临床试验数据，比较了早期融合（随机森林）和潜在空间融合（组合模型）的表现，评估指标为MSE和R2。

Result: 组合模型在所有设置中表现最佳（MSE更低，R2更高），且避免了过拟合问题，多模态数据整合效果显著。

Conclusion: 潜在空间融合为多模态心理健康数据预测提供了更优方法，未来需关注模型可解释性和个体化预测。

Abstract: Background: Mental illnesses such as depression and anxiety require improved
methods for early detection and personalized intervention. Traditional
predictive models often rely on unimodal data or early fusion strategies that
fail to capture the complex, multimodal nature of psychiatric data. Advanced
integration techniques, such as intermediate (latent space) fusion, may offer
better accuracy and clinical utility. Methods: Using data from the BRIGHTEN
clinical trial, we evaluated intermediate (latent space) fusion for predicting
daily depressive symptoms (PHQ-2 scores). We compared early fusion implemented
with a Random Forest (RF) model and intermediate fusion implemented via a
Combined Model (CM) using autoencoders and a neural network. The dataset
included behavioral (smartphone-based), demographic, and clinical features.
Experiments were conducted across multiple temporal splits and data stream
combinations. Performance was evaluated using mean squared error (MSE) and
coefficient of determination (R2). Results: The CM outperformed both RF and
Linear Regression (LR) baselines across all setups, achieving lower MSE (0.4985
vs. 0.5305 with RF) and higher R2 (0.4695 vs. 0.4356). The RF model showed
signs of overfitting, with a large gap between training and test performance,
while the CM maintained consistent generalization. Performance was best when
integrating all data modalities in the CM (in contradistinction to RF),
underscoring the value of latent space fusion for capturing non-linear
interactions in complex psychiatric datasets. Conclusion: Latent space fusion
offers a robust alternative to traditional fusion methods for prediction with
multimodal mental health data. Future work should explore model
interpretability and individual-level prediction for clinical deployment.

Result: 研究发现，尽管数据集中肤色比例均衡，但AI模型在深色皮肤人群中的表现显著较差。

Conclusion: 研究强调了公平性审计的必要性，并提供了诊断AI系统结构性不平等的工具，推动数据驱动的医疗公平性讨论。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) systems increasingly inform medical
decision-making, yet concerns about algorithmic bias and inequitable outcomes
persist, particularly for historically marginalized populations. This paper
introduces the concept of Predictive Representativity (PR), a framework of
fairness auditing that shifts the focus from the composition of the data set to
outcomes-level equity. Through a case study in dermatology, we evaluated
AI-based skin cancer classifiers trained on the widely used HAM10000 dataset
and on an independent clinical dataset (BOSQUE Test set) from Colombia. Our
analysis reveals substantial performance disparities by skin phototype, with
classifiers consistently underperforming for individuals with darker skin,
despite proportional sampling in the source data. We argue that
representativity must be understood not as a static feature of datasets but as
a dynamic, context-sensitive property of model predictions. PR operationalizes
this shift by quantifying how reliably models generalize fairness across
subpopulations and deployment contexts. We further propose an External
Transportability Criterion that formalizes the thresholds for fairness
generalization. Our findings highlight the ethical imperative for post-hoc
fairness auditing, transparency in dataset documentation, and inclusive model
validation pipelines. This work offers a scalable tool for diagnosing
structural inequities in AI systems, contributing to discussions on equity,
interpretability, and data justice and fostering a critical re-evaluation of
fairness in data-driven healthcare.

Abstract: This paper aims to understand the training solution, which is obtained by the
back-propagation algorithm, of two-layer neural networks whose hidden layer is
composed of the units with smooth activation functions, including the usual
sigmoid type most commonly used before the advent of ReLUs. The mechanism
contains four main principles: construction of Taylor series expansions, strict
partial order of knots, smooth-spline implementation and smooth-continuity
restriction. The universal approximation for arbitrary input dimensionality is
proved and experimental verification is given, through which the mystery of
``black box'' of the solution space is largely revealed. The new proofs
employed also enrich approximation theory.

Conclusion: FBE方法简单有效，提升了OOD检测能力，并通过理论分析和实验验证。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is critical to ensuring the reliability
of deep learning applications and has attracted significant attention in recent
years. A rich body of literature has emerged to develop efficient score
functions that assign high scores to in-distribution (ID) samples and low
scores to OOD samples, thereby helping distinguish OOD samples. Among these
methods, distance-based score functions are widely used because of their
efficiency and ease of use. However, deep learning often leads to a biased
distribution of data features, and extreme features are inevitable. These
extreme features make the distance-based methods tend to assign too low scores
to ID samples. This limits the OOD detection capabilities of such methods. To
address this issue, we propose a simple yet effective method, Feature Bank
Enhancement (FBE), that uses statistical characteristics from dataset to
identify and constrain extreme features to the separation boundaries, therapy
making the distance between samples inside and outside the distribution
farther. We conducted experiments on large-scale ImageNet-1k and CIFAR-10
respectively, and the results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance on both benchmark. Additionally, theoretical analysis and
supplementary experiments are conducted to provide more insights into our
method.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型（LLMs）的激活稀疏性为降低计算成本提供了机会，但直接预测神经元级别的激活模式计算成本过高。

Method: 提出一种聚类框架，将相似激活模式分组为少量代表性聚类，通过预测聚类分配而非单个神经元状态来高效推断激活模式。

Conclusion: 聚类框架为激活模式预测提供了基础，有望提升大规模语言模型的高效推理能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit significant activation sparsity, where
only a subset of neurons are active for a given input. Although this sparsity
presents opportunities to reduce computational cost, efficiently utilizing it
requires predicting activation patterns in a scalable manner. However, direct
prediction at the neuron level is computationally expensive due to the vast
number of neurons in modern LLMs. To enable efficient prediction and
utilization of activation sparsity, we propose a clustering-based activation
pattern compression framework. Instead of treating each neuron independently,
we group similar activation patterns into a small set of representative
clusters. Our method achieves up to 79.34% clustering precision, outperforming
standard binary clustering approaches while maintaining minimal degradation in
perplexity (PPL) scores. With a sufficiently large number of clusters, our
approach attains a PPL score as low as 12.49, demonstrating its effectiveness
in preserving model quality while reducing computational overhead. By
predicting cluster assignments rather than individual neuron states, future
models can efficiently infer activation patterns from pre-computed centroids.
We detail the clustering algorithm, analyze its effectiveness in capturing
meaningful activation structures, and demonstrate its potential to improve
sparse computation efficiency. This clustering-based formulation serves as a
foundation for future work on activation pattern prediction, paving the way for
efficient inference in large-scale language models.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于深度学习的毫米波MIMO系统波束对齐引擎（BAE），通过数字孪生和迁移学习减少数据需求，利用SHAP和DkNN提升透明度和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在6G愿景中，毫米波系统的可解释性和鲁棒性对建立信任和确保可靠性能至关重要。传统深度学习方法面临数据收集成本高、硬件限制、缺乏可解释性及易受对抗攻击等问题。

Method: BAE利用宽波束的RSSI测量预测最佳窄波束，减少波束扫描开销；通过数字孪生生成合成数据，并结合迁移学习优化模型；使用SHAP和DkNN提升透明度和鲁棒性。

Abstract: In line with the AI-native 6G vision, explainability and robustness are
crucial for building trust and ensuring reliable performance in millimeter-wave
(mmWave) systems. Efficient beam alignment is essential for initial access, but
deep learning (DL) solutions face challenges, including high data collection
overhead, hardware constraints, lack of explainability, and susceptibility to
adversarial attacks. This paper proposes a robust and explainable DL-based beam
alignment engine (BAE) for mmWave multiple-input multiple output (MIMO)
systems. The BAE uses received signal strength indicator (RSSI) measurements
from wide beams to predict the best narrow beam, reducing the overhead of
exhaustive beam sweeping. To overcome the challenge of real-world data
collection, this work leverages a site-specific digital twin (DT) to generate
synthetic channel data closely resembling real-world environments. A model
refinement via transfer learning is proposed to fine-tune the pre-trained model
residing in the DT with minimal real-world data, effectively bridging
mismatches between the digital replica and real-world environments. To reduce
beam training overhead and enhance transparency, the framework uses deep
Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) to rank input features by importance,
prioritizing key spatial directions and minimizing beam sweeping. It also
incorporates the Deep k-nearest neighbors (DkNN) algorithm, providing a
credibility metric for detecting out-of-distribution inputs and ensuring
robust, transparent decision-making. Experimental results show that the
proposed framework reduces real-world data needs by 70%, beam training overhead
by 62%, and improves outlier detection robustness by up to 8.5x, achieving
near-optimal spectral efficiency and transparent decision making compared to
traditional softmax based DL models.

TL;DR: 提出了一种半监督联邦学习框架SSFL-DCSL，通过双对比损失和软标签解决数据分布差异和标签稀缺问题，提升故障诊断性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统监督深度学习方法需要大量标注数据且数据分布差异影响性能，SSFL-DCSL旨在解决这些问题并保护用户隐私。

Method: 设计基于拉普拉斯分布的样本加权函数、引入双对比损失（局部和全局），并通过加权平均和动量更新聚合原型。

Result: 在仅10%标注数据的挑战性任务中，SSFL-DCSL比现有方法准确率提升1.15%至7.85%。

Conclusion: SSFL-DCSL有效解决了数据分布差异和标签稀缺问题，提升了故障诊断性能。

Abstract: Intelligent fault diagnosis (IFD) plays a crucial role in ensuring the safe
operation of industrial machinery and improving production efficiency. However,
traditional supervised deep learning methods require a large amount of training
data and labels, which are often located in different clients. Additionally,
the cost of data labeling is high, making labels difficult to acquire.
Meanwhile, differences in data distribution among clients may also hinder the
model's performance. To tackle these challenges, this paper proposes a
semi-supervised federated learning framework, SSFL-DCSL, which integrates dual
contrastive loss and soft labeling to address data and label scarcity for
distributed clients with few labeled samples while safeguarding user privacy.
It enables representation learning using unlabeled data on the client side and
facilitates joint learning among clients through prototypes, thereby achieving
mutual knowledge sharing and preventing local model divergence. Specifically,
first, a sample weighting function based on the Laplace distribution is
designed to alleviate bias caused by low confidence in pseudo labels during the
semi-supervised training process. Second, a dual contrastive loss is introduced
to mitigate model divergence caused by different data distributions, comprising
local contrastive loss and global contrastive loss. Third, local prototypes are
aggregated on the server with weighted averaging and updated with momentum to
share knowledge among clients. To evaluate the proposed SSFL-DCSL framework,
experiments are conducted on two publicly available datasets and a dataset
collected on motors from the factory. In the most challenging task, where only
10\% of the data are labeled, the proposed SSFL-DCSL can improve accuracy by
1.15% to 7.85% over state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: 论文提出B4模型，通过结合历史价格和外部信号，建模投资者偏见驱动的市场动态，提升趋势预测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 金融市场的动态复杂性由历史价格和外部叙事（如新闻、社交媒体情绪）共同塑造，但数据异质性和投资者偏见增加了建模难度。

Method: 提出B4模型，将价格序列和外部信号嵌入共享潜在空间，通过惯性配对和双竞争机制捕捉偏见驱动的行为不对称和市场异质性。

Result: 实验表明，B4在预测市场趋势上表现优异，并能解释偏见、投资者行为与市场动态的相互作用。

Conclusion: B4为建模偏见驱动的市场动态提供了统一框架，兼具预测性能和可解释性。

Abstract: Financial markets exhibit highly dynamic and complex behaviors shaped by both
historical price trajectories and exogenous narratives, such as news, policy
interpretations, and social media sentiment. The heterogeneity in these data
and the diverse insight of investors introduce biases that complicate the
modeling of market dynamics. Unlike prior work, this paper explores the
potential of bull and bear regimes in investor-driven market dynamics. Through
empirical analysis on real-world financial datasets, we uncover a dynamic
relationship between bias variation and behavioral adaptation, which enhances
trend prediction under evolving market conditions. To model this mechanism, we
propose the Bias to Behavior from Bull-Bear Dynamics model (B4), a unified
framework that jointly embeds temporal price sequences and external contextual
signals into a shared latent space where opposing bull and bear forces
naturally emerge, forming the foundation for bias representation. Within this
space, an inertial pairing module pairs temporally adjacent samples to preserve
momentum, while the dual competition mechanism contrasts bullish and bearish
embeddings to capture behavioral divergence. Together, these components allow
B4 to model bias-driven asymmetry, behavioral inertia, and market
heterogeneity. Experimental results on real-world financial datasets
demonstrate that our model not only achieves superior performance in predicting
market trends but also provides interpretable insights into the interplay of
biases, investor behaviors, and market dynamics.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为LaCache的KV缓存优化方法，用于提升大语言模型的长距离建模能力和连续生成效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着序列长度增加，LLMs中的KV对数量激增，导致效率瓶颈，需要一种无需训练的高效优化方法。

Method: LaCache采用阶梯形KV缓存模式和迭代压缩机制，优化KV对的存储和压缩。

Result: 实验验证了LaCache在提升长距离能力和连续生成效率方面的有效性。

Conclusion: LaCache是一种高效且无需训练的KV缓存优化方法，适用于长距离建模任务。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have spurred interest in
numerous applications requiring robust long-range capabilities, essential for
processing extensive input contexts and continuously generating extended
outputs. As sequence lengths increase, the number of Key-Value (KV) pairs in
LLMs escalates, creating a significant efficiency bottleneck. In this paper, we
propose a new KV cache optimization paradigm called LaCache, a training-free
method for efficient and accurate generative inference of LLMs. LaCache enables
LLMs to simultaneously address both of the critical challenges in long-range
modeling: robust long-range capabilities and continuous generation without
running out-of-memory (OOM). Specifically, LaCache integrates two key
innovations: (1) a ladder-shaped KV cache pattern that stores KV pairs not only
sequentially (left-to-right within each layer) but also across layers (from
shallow to deep), providing an extended span for capturing long-range
dependencies under a fixed storage budget, thereby boosting long-range
capabilities; and (2) an iterative compaction mechanism that progressively
compresses older caches, freeing up space for new tokens within a fixed cache
size. This token distance-based dynamic compression enables more effective
continuous generation under constrained cache budgets. Experiments across
various tasks, benchmarks, and LLM models consistently validate LaCache's
effectiveness in enhancing LLMs' long-range capabilities. Our code is available

Abstract: This study aims to develop a deep learning system for an accessibility device
for the deaf or hearing impaired. The device will accurately localize and
identify sound sources in real time. This study will fill an important gap in
current research by leveraging machine learning techniques to target the
underprivileged community. The system includes three main components. 1.
JerryNet: A custom designed CNN architecture that determines the direction of
arrival (DoA) for nine possible directions. 2. Audio Classification: This model
is based on fine-tuning the Contrastive Language-Audio Pretraining (CLAP) model
to identify the exact sound classes only based on audio. 3. Multimodal
integration model: This is an accurate sound localization model that combines
audio, visual, and text data to locate the exact sound sources in the images.
The part consists of two modules, one object detection using Yolov9 to generate
all the bounding boxes of the objects, and an audio visual localization model
to identify the optimal bounding box using complete Intersection over Union
(CIoU). The hardware consists of a four-microphone rectangular formation and a
camera mounted on glasses with a wristband for displaying necessary information
like direction. On a custom collected data set, JerryNet achieved a precision
of 91. 1% for the sound direction, outperforming all the baseline models. The
CLAP model achieved 98.5% and 95% accuracy on custom and AudioSet datasets,
respectively. The audio-visual localization model within component 3 yielded a
cIoU of 0.892 and an AUC of 0.658, surpassing other similar models. There are
many future potentials to this study, paving the way to creating a new

Result: 模型准确率为98%，发现水资源接近度、海拔和季节变化是阿曼绿色氢气选址的最关键因素。

Conclusion: 该研究为决策者提供了可扩展的工具，适用于数据稀缺地区的绿色氢气基础设施规划。

Abstract: As nations seek sustainable alternatives to fossil fuels, green hydrogen has
emerged as a promising strategic pathway toward decarbonisation, particularly
in solar-rich arid regions. However, identifying optimal locations for hydrogen
production requires the integration of complex environmental, atmospheric, and
infrastructural factors, often compounded by limited availability of direct
hydrogen yield data. This study presents a novel Artificial Intelligence (AI)
framework for computing green hydrogen yield and site suitability index using
mean absolute SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values. This framework
consists of a multi-stage pipeline of unsupervised multi-variable clustering,
supervised machine learning classifier and SHAP algorithm. The pipeline trains
on an integrated meteorological, topographic and temporal dataset and the
results revealed distinct spatial patterns of suitability and relative
influence of the variables. With model predictive accuracy of 98%, the result
also showed that water proximity, elevation and seasonal variation are the most
influential factors determining green hydrogen site suitability in Oman with
mean absolute shap values of 2.470891, 2.376296 and 1.273216 respectively.
Given limited or absence of ground-truth yield data in many countries that have
green hydrogen prospects and ambitions, this study offers an objective and
reproducible alternative to subjective expert weightings, thus allowing the
data to speak for itself and potentially discover novel latent groupings
without pre-imposed assumptions. This study offers industry stakeholders and
policymakers a replicable and scalable tool for green hydrogen infrastructure
planning and other decision making in data-scarce regions.

Method: 利用梯度轨迹作为数据，在元学习器中独立训练，最大化梯度内积同时限制偏离经验风险最小化梯度。

Result: 在DomainBed数据集上表现优于基线方法，且计算高效。

Conclusion: POGM方法有效解决了梯度波动和计算问题，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: In this study, we address the gradient-based domain generalization problem,
where predictors aim for consistent gradient directions across different
domains. Existing methods have two main challenges. First, minimization of
gradient empirical distance or gradient inner products (GIP) leads to gradient
fluctuations among domains, thereby hindering straightforward learning. Second,
the direct application of gradient learning to the joint loss function can
incur high computation overheads due to second-order derivative approximation.
To tackle these challenges, we propose a new Pareto Optimality Gradient
Matching (POGM) method. In contrast to existing methods that add gradient
matching as regularization, we leverage gradient trajectories as collected data
and apply independent training at the meta-learner. In the meta-update, we
maximize GIP while limiting the learned gradient from deviating too far from
the empirical risk minimization gradient trajectory. By doing so, the aggregate
gradient can incorporate knowledge from all domains without suffering gradient
fluctuation towards any particular domain. Experimental evaluations on datasets
from DomainBed demonstrate competitive results yielded by POGM against other
baselines while achieving computational efficiency.

a foundational model that predicts nanomaterial-protein affinities through
multimodal representation learning, demonstrating strong generalization,

multimodal modeling significantly outperforms single-modality approaches and
identifies key determinants of corona formation. Furthermore, we demonstrate
its applicability to a range of downstream tasks through zero-shot inference

high-performance and generalized prediction of nanomaterial-protein interaction
endpoints, reducing experimental reliance and accelerating various in vitro
applications.

Conclusion: LDM是一种有潜力的线性降维技术，具有理论和实际扩展前景。

Abstract: We introduce the Linearized Diffusion Map (LDM), a novel linear
dimensionality reduction method constructed via a linear approximation of the
diffusion-map kernel. LDM integrates the geometric intuition of diffusion-based
nonlinear methods with the computational simplicity, efficiency, and
interpretability inherent in linear embeddings such as PCA and classical MDS.
Through comprehensive experiments on synthetic datasets (Swiss roll and
hyperspheres) and real-world benchmarks (MNIST and COIL-20), we illustrate that
LDM captures distinct geometric features of datasets compared to PCA, offering
complementary advantages. Specifically, LDM embeddings outperform PCA in
datasets exhibiting explicit manifold structures, particularly in
high-dimensional regimes, whereas PCA remains preferable in scenarios dominated
by variance or noise. Furthermore, the complete positivity of LDM's kernel
matrix allows direct applicability of Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF),
suggesting opportunities for interpretable latent-structure discovery. Our
analysis positions LDM as a valuable new linear dimensionality reduction
technique with promising theoretical and practical extensions.

Abstract: Multi-turn problem solving is critical yet challenging for Large Reasoning
Models (LRMs) to reflect on their reasoning and revise from feedback. Existing
Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods train large reasoning models on a
single-turn paradigm with verifiable rewards. However, we observe that models
trained with existing RL paradigms often lose their ability to solve problems
across multiple turns and struggle to revise answers based on contextual
feedback, leading to repetitive responses. We ask: can LRMs learn to reflect
their answers in a multi-turn context? In this work, we find that training
models with multi-turn RL using only unary feedback (e.g., "Let's try again")
after wrong answers can improve both single-turn performance and multi-turn
reasoning. We introduce Unary Feedback as Observation (UFO) for reinforcement
learning, which uses minimal yet common unary user feedback during iterative
problem solving. It can be easily applied to existing single-turn RL training
setups. Experimental results show that RL training with UFO keeps single-turn
performance and improves multi-turn reasoning accuracy by up to 14%, enabling
language models to better react to feedback in multi-turn problem solving. To
further minimize the number of turns needed for a correct answer while
encouraging diverse reasoning when mistakes occur, we design reward structures
that guide models to produce careful and deliberate answers in each turn. Code:

Conclusion: FedStrategist为去中心化AI系统提供了一种实用且可分析的安全解决方案。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) offers a paradigm for privacy-preserving
collaborative AI, but its decentralized nature creates significant
vulnerabilities to model poisoning attacks. While numerous static defenses
exist, their effectiveness is highly context-dependent, often failing against
adaptive adversaries or in heterogeneous data environments. This paper
introduces FedStrategist, a novel meta-learning framework that reframes robust
aggregation as a real-time, cost-aware control problem. We design a lightweight
contextual bandit agent that dynamically selects the optimal aggregation rule
from an arsenal of defenses based on real-time diagnostic metrics. Through
comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that no single static rule is
universally optimal. We show that our adaptive agent successfully learns
superior policies across diverse scenarios, including a ``Krum-favorable"
environment and against a sophisticated "stealth" adversary designed to
neutralize specific diagnostic signals. Critically, we analyze the paradoxical
scenario where a non-robust baseline achieves high but compromised accuracy,
and demonstrate that our agent learns a conservative policy to prioritize model
integrity. Furthermore, we prove the agent's policy is controllable via a
single "risk tolerance" parameter, allowing practitioners to explicitly manage
the trade-off between performance and security. Our work provides a new,
practical, and analyzable approach to creating resilient and intelligent
decentralized AI systems.

Conclusion: 该研究填补了深度伪造检测中个体公平性的空白，为未来研究提供了重要方向。

Abstract: Generative AI models have substantially improved the realism of synthetic
media, yet their misuse through sophisticated DeepFakes poses significant
risks. Despite recent advances in deepfake detection, fairness remains
inadequately addressed, enabling deepfake markers to exploit biases against
specific populations. While previous studies have emphasized group-level
fairness, individual fairness (i.e., ensuring similar predictions for similar
individuals) remains largely unexplored. In this work, we identify for the
first time that the original principle of individual fairness fundamentally
fails in the context of deepfake detection, revealing a critical gap previously
unexplored in the literature. To mitigate it, we propose the first
generalizable framework that can be integrated into existing deepfake detectors
to enhance individual fairness and generalization. Extensive experiments
conducted on leading deepfake datasets demonstrate that our approach
significantly improves individual fairness while maintaining robust detection
performance, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. The code is available at

Motivation: 传统经验模型在预测CHF时误差较大，且缺乏可解释性和对数据稀缺的鲁棒性，因此需要更准确的方法。

Method: 开发并验证了四种基于机器学习的模型，结合确定性基础模型（Biasi、Bowring、Katto）和ML预测残差进行修正。

Result: 混合ML模型的平均相对误差低于3.5%，显著优于传统模型的26%误差。

Conclusion: 混合ML方法在环形几何中预测CHF更准确，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of critical heat flux (CHF) is an essential component of
safety analysis in pressurized and boiling water reactors. To support reliable
prediction of this quantity, several empirical correlations and lookup tables
have been constructed from physical experiments over the past several decades.
With the onset of accessible machine learning (ML) frameworks, multiple
initiatives have been established with the goal of predicting CHF more
accurately than these traditional methods. While purely data-driven surrogate
modeling has been extensively investigated, these approaches lack
interpretability, lack resilience to data scarcity, and have been developed
mostly using data from tube experiments. As a result, bias-correction hybrid
approaches have become increasingly popular, which correct initial
"low-fidelity" estimates provided by deterministic base models by using
ML-predicted residuals. This body of work has mostly considered round tube
geometries; annular geometry-specific ML models have not yet been deployed in
thermal hydraulic codes. This study developed, deployed, and validated four ML
models to predict CHF in annular geometries using the CTF subchannel code.
Three empirical correlation models, Biasi, Bowring, and Katto, were used as
base models for comparison. The ML models were trained and tested using 577
experimental annulus data points from four datasets: Becker, Beus, Janssen, and
Mortimore. Baseline CHF predictions were obtained from the empirical
correlations, with mean relative errors above 26%. The ML-driven models
achieved mean relative errors below 3.5%, with no more than one point exceeding
the 10% error envelope. In all cases, the hybrid ML models significantly
outperformed their empirical counterparts.

Abstract: Language models are commonly fine-tuned via reinforcement learning to alter
their behavior or elicit new capabilities. Datasets used for these purposes,
and particularly human preference datasets, are often noisy. The relatively
small size post-training datasets, combined with parameter-efficient
fine-tuning methods, enable the use of influence functions approximations to
detect and prune training examples that are harmful to performance on a
validation set. In this work, we adapt the TL;DR dataset for reward model
training to demonstrate how conjugate-gradient approximated influence functions
can be used to filter datasets. In our experiments, influence function
filtering yields a small retraining accuracy uplift of 1.5% after removing 10%
of training examples. We also show that gradient similarity outperforms
influence functions for detecting helpful training examples. This suggests that
local curvature is important for detecting harmful training examples, but less
so for identifying helpful examples.

### [208] [Solo Connection: A Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning Technique for Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14353)
*Harsh Nilesh Pathak,Randy Paffenroth*

TL;DR: Solo Connection是一种新的参数高效微调方法，通过调整解码器块级别的表示而非单个权重矩阵，优于LoRA，并大幅减少可训练参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索更高效的PEFT方法，减少参数数量，同时提升性能，并利用同伦理论实现平滑稳定的适应。

Method: 引入可训练的线性变换，逐步插值零向量和任务特定表示，采用长跳跃连接增强模型适应能力。

Result: Solo Connection在E2E自然语言生成基准上优于LoRA，可训练参数减少59%（相比LoRA）和99%以上（相比全微调）。

Conclusion: Solo Connection为大规模语言模型提供了一种高效、稳定的微调方法，尤其适用于多层架构。

Abstract: Parameter efficient fine tuning (PEFT) is a versatile and extensible approach
for adapting a Large Language Model (LLM) for newer tasks. One of the most
prominent PEFT approaches, Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA), primarily focuses on
adjusting the attention weight matrices within individual decoder blocks of a
Generative Pre trained Transformer (GPT2). In contrast, we introduce Solo
Connection a novel method that adapts the representation at the decoder-block
level rather than modifying individual weight matrices. Not only does Solo
Connection outperform LoRA on E2E natural language generation benchmarks, but
it also reduces the number of trainable parameters by 59% relative to LoRA and
by more than 99% compared to full fine-tuning of GPT2, an early version of
Large Language Models (LLMs). Solo Connection is also motivated by homotopy
theory: we introduce a trainable linear transformation that gradually
interpolates between a zero vector and the task-specific representation,
enabling smooth and stable adaptation over time. While skip connections in the
original 12 layer GPT2 are typically confined to individual decoder blocks,
subsequent GPT2 variants scale up to 48 layers, and even larger language models
can include 128 or more decoder blocks. These expanded architectures underscore
the need to revisit how skip connections are employed during fine-tuning. This
paper focuses on long skip connections that link outputs of different decoder
blocks, potentially enhancing the model's ability to adapt to new tasks while
leveraging pre-trained knowledge.

Motivation: 针对实时关键基础设施面临的网络攻击威胁，传统检测方法因高数据方差和类别不平衡导致高误报率，且静态因果方法无法适应动态数据分布变化。

Method: INCADET包含三个模块：早期症状检测（通过边权重分布变化识别系统状态转变）、增量因果图学习（利用经验回放和边强化更新因果结构）、因果图分类（使用GCN分类系统状态）。

Result: 在真实关键基础设施数据集上，INCADET在准确性、鲁棒性和适应性上优于静态因果和深度时序基线方法。

Conclusion: INCADET为实时网络攻击检测提供了一种高效、动态的解决方案，能够适应不断变化的攻击模式。

Abstract: The escalating threat of cyberattacks on real-time critical infrastructures
poses serious risks to public safety, demanding detection methods that
effectively capture complex system interdependencies and adapt to evolving
attack patterns. Traditional real-time anomaly detection techniques often
suffer from excessive false positives due to their statistical sensitivity to
high data variance and class imbalance. To address these limitations, recent
research has explored modeling causal relationships among system components.
However, prior work mainly focuses on offline causal graph-based approaches
that require static historical data and fail to generalize to real-time
settings. These methods are fundamentally constrained by: (1) their inability
to adapt to dynamic shifts in data distribution without retraining, and (2) the
risk of catastrophic forgetting when lacking timely supervision in live
systems. To overcome these challenges, we propose INCADET, a novel framework
for incremental causal graph learning tailored to real-time cyberattack
detection. INCADET dynamically captures evolving system behavior by
incrementally updating causal graphs across streaming time windows. The
framework comprises three modules: 1) Early Symptom Detection: Detects
transitions in system status using divergence in edge-weight distributions
across sequential causal graphs. 2) Incremental Causal Graph Learning:
Leverages experience replay and edge reinforcement to continually refine causal
structures while preserving prior knowledge. 3) Causal Graph Classification:
Employs Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) to classify system status using the
learned causal graphs. Extensive experiments on real-world critical
infrastructure datasets demonstrate that INCADET achieves superior accuracy,
robustness, and adaptability compared to both static causal and deep temporal
baselines in evolving attack scenarios.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究简单测试时缩放方法的有效性，探索o1类模型与简单缩放方法的区别，以揭示真正的计算扩展目标。

Method: 分析简单测试时缩放行为，比较限制最大长度与追加“Wait”的效果，并研究o1类模型的自然扩展能力。

Result: 限制最大长度是简单缩放的主要方式，追加“Wait”会导致不一致性；o1类模型通过强化学习自然扩展计算能力，性能更高。

Conclusion: 简单测试时缩放仅能复制缩放行为的外观，而真正的目标是解锁更高性能，o1类模型通过自然扩展实现这一目标。

Abstract: Prior work proposed simple test-time scaling, a method for replicating this
scaling behavior with models distilled from o1-like models by manually
controlling test-time compute: either scaling down by enforcing a maximum
length or scaling up by iteratively appending "Wait" when the model is about to
terminate its generation. This paper presents an analysis of simple test-time
scaling and finds that the scaling behavior is largely attributed to scaling
down by enforcing a maximum length. In contrast, fine-tuning on long CoT data
distilled from o1-like models has no significant impact on scaling behavior,
and scaling up by appending "Wait" leads to inconsistencies, as the model may
oscillate between solutions. A key distinction exists between scaling down by
enforcing a maximum length and scaling up test-time compute in o1-like models,
such as DeepSeek-R1\@. These models are typically allowed to utilize as much
compute as needed, with the only constraint being the model's maximum supported
length. By learning to naturally scale up test-time compute during
reinforcement learning, o1-like models surpass their peak performance when
scaling up. In contrast, simple test-time scaling progressively imposes a lower
upper limit on model performance as it scales down. While replicating the
test-time scaling behavior of o1 models can be straightforward by scaling down,
it is crucial to recognize that the goal of scaling test-time compute is to
unlock higher performance -- beyond what the model could originally achieve --
rather than merely reproducing the appearance of scaling behavior.

Abstract: In this work, we study how to efficiently apply reinforcement learning (RL)
for solving large-scale stochastic optimization problems by leveraging
intervention models. The key of the proposed methodology is to better explore
the solution space by simulating and composing the stochastic processes using
pre-trained deep learning (DL) models. We demonstrate our approach on a
challenging real-world application, the multi-sourcing multi-period inventory
management problem in supply chain optimization. In particular, we employ deep
RL models for learning and forecasting the stochastic supply chain processes
under a range of assumptions. Moreover, we also introduce a constraint
coordination mechanism, designed to forecast dual costs given the
cross-products constraints in the inventory network. We highlight that instead
of directly modeling the complex physical constraints into the RL optimization
problem and solving the stochastic problem as a whole, our approach breaks down
those supply chain processes into scalable and composable DL modules, leading
to improved performance on large real-world datasets. We also outline open
problems for future research to further investigate the efficacy of such
models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统GNN方法假设节点标签条件独立，这与实际图中节点标签的相关性矛盾。ReDiSC旨在解决这一问题，实现结构化节点分类。

Method: ReDiSC使用重新参数化的掩码扩散模型估计节点标签的联合分布，并通过变分EM框架学习。

Result: ReDiSC在实验中优于或与现有GNN、标签传播和扩散基线方法竞争，且在大规模数据集上表现出高效性。

Conclusion: ReDiSC在结构化节点分类任务中具有显著优势，特别是在大规模数据集上的可扩展性。

Abstract: In recent years, graph neural networks (GNN) have achieved unprecedented
successes in node classification tasks. Although GNNs inherently encode
specific inductive biases (e.g., acting as low-pass or high-pass filters), most
existing methods implicitly assume conditional independence among node labels
in their optimization objectives. While this assumption is suitable for
traditional classification tasks such as image recognition, it contradicts the
intuitive observation that node labels in graphs remain correlated, even after
conditioning on the graph structure. To make structured predictions for node
labels, we propose ReDiSC, namely, Reparameterized masked Diffusion model for
Structured node Classification. ReDiSC estimates the joint distribution of node
labels using a reparameterized masked diffusion model, which is learned through
the variational expectation-maximization (EM) framework. Our theoretical
analysis shows the efficiency advantage of ReDiSC in the E-step compared to
DPM-SNC, a state-of-the-art model that relies on a manifold-constrained
diffusion model in continuous domain. Meanwhile, we explicitly link ReDiSC's
M-step objective to popular GNN and label propagation hybrid approaches.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that ReDiSC achieves superior or highly
competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art GNN, label propagation,
and diffusion-based baselines across both homophilic and heterophilic graphs of
varying sizes. Notably, ReDiSC scales effectively to large-scale datasets on
which previous structured diffusion methods fail due to computational
constraints, highlighting its significant practical advantage in structured
node classification tasks.

Result: 实验证明算法在异质环境中有效且鲁棒，性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FRL-EH框架和FedRQ算法在联邦强化学习中表现出色，适用于复杂异质环境。

Abstract: We investigate a Federated Reinforcement Learning with Environment
Heterogeneity (FRL-EH) framework, where local environments exhibit statistical
heterogeneity. Within this framework, agents collaboratively learn a global
policy by aggregating their collective experiences while preserving the privacy
of their local trajectories. To better reflect real-world scenarios, we
introduce a robust FRL-EH framework by presenting a novel global objective
function. This function is specifically designed to optimize a global policy
that ensures robust performance across heterogeneous local environments and
their plausible perturbations. We propose a tabular FRL algorithm named FedRQ
and theoretically prove its asymptotic convergence to an optimal policy for the
global objective function. Furthermore, we extend FedRQ to environments with
continuous state space through the use of expectile loss, addressing the key
challenge of minimizing a value function over a continuous subset of the state
space. This advancement facilitates the seamless integration of the principles
of FedRQ with various Deep Neural Network (DNN)-based RL algorithms. Extensive
empirical evaluations validate the effectiveness and robustness of our FRL
algorithms across diverse heterogeneous environments, consistently achieving
superior performance over the existing state-of-the-art FRL algorithms.

Result: 证明了检测故障对树集成模型是NP完全的，并通过实验验证了算法的有效性和计算可行性。

Conclusion: 故障广泛存在且可能指示模型不一致性，需进一步研究以提高模型可靠性。

Abstract: Many critical decision-making tasks are now delegated to machine-learned
models, and it is imperative that their decisions are trustworthy and reliable,
and their outputs are consistent across similar inputs. We identify a new
source of unreliable behaviors-called glitches-which may significantly impair
the reliability of AI models having steep decision boundaries. Roughly
speaking, glitches are small neighborhoods in the input space where the model's
output abruptly oscillates with respect to small changes in the input. We
provide a formal definition of glitches, and use well-known models and datasets
from the literature to demonstrate that they have widespread existence and
argue they usually indicate potential model inconsistencies in the neighborhood
of where they are found. We proceed to the algorithmic search of glitches for
widely used gradient-boosted decision tree (GBDT) models. We prove that the
problem of detecting glitches is NP-complete for tree ensembles, already for
trees of depth 4. Our glitch-search algorithm for GBDT models uses an MILP
encoding of the problem, and its effectiveness and computational feasibility
are demonstrated on a set of widely used GBDT benchmarks taken from the
literature.

Result: 在ImageNet验证集上，无监督设置下显著超越KL基线16.29%，监督设置下ResNet-50达到82.28% top-1准确率。

Conclusion: GenDD框架在知识蒸馏中表现出色，尤其在无监督和监督任务中均取得显著成果。

Abstract: In this paper, we formulate the knowledge distillation (KD) as a conditional
generative problem and propose the \textit{Generative Distribution Distillation
(GenDD)} framework. A naive \textit{GenDD} baseline encounters two major
challenges: the curse of high-dimensional optimization and the lack of semantic
supervision from labels. To address these issues, we introduce a \textit{Split
Tokenization} strategy, achieving stable and effective unsupervised KD.
Additionally, we develop the \textit{Distribution Contraction} technique to
integrate label supervision into the reconstruction objective. Our theoretical
proof demonstrates that \textit{GenDD} with \textit{Distribution Contraction}
serves as a gradient-level surrogate for multi-task learning, realizing
efficient supervised training without explicit classification loss on
multi-step sampling image representations. To evaluate the effectiveness of our
method, we conduct experiments on balanced, imbalanced, and unlabeled data.
Experimental results show that \textit{GenDD} performs competitively in the
unsupervised setting, significantly surpassing KL baseline by \textbf{16.29\%}
on ImageNet validation set. With label supervision, our ResNet-50 achieves
\textbf{82.28\%} top-1 accuracy on ImageNet in 600 epochs training,
establishing a new state-of-the-art.

TL;DR: 提出了SDSC（Signal Dice Similarity Coefficient），一种用于时间序列自监督表示学习的结构感知度量函数，优于传统的MSE方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自监督学习方法（如MSE）对振幅敏感、对波形极性不变且尺度无界，阻碍了语义对齐和可解释性。

Method: SDSC基于Dice相似系数，通过量化时间信号的结构一致性来改进表示学习，并提出了可微分的近似Heaviside函数用于梯度优化。还结合了混合损失（SDSC+MSE）以提高稳定性。

Result: 实验表明，SDSC在预测和分类任务中表现优于或与MSE相当，尤其在领域内和低资源场景中。

Conclusion: 结构感知度量（如SDSC）能提升信号表示的语义质量，可作为传统距离方法的有效替代。

Abstract: We propose the Signal Dice Similarity Coefficient (SDSC), a structure-aware
metric function for time series self-supervised representation learning. Most
Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) methods for signals commonly adopt
distance-based objectives such as mean squared error (MSE), which are sensitive
to amplitude, invariant to waveform polarity, and unbounded in scale. These
properties hinder semantic alignment and reduce interpretability. SDSC
addresses this by quantifying structural agreement between temporal signals
based on the intersection of signed amplitudes, derived from the Dice
Similarity Coefficient (DSC).Although SDSC is defined as a structure-aware
metric, it can be used as a loss by subtracting from 1 and applying a
differentiable approximation of the Heaviside function for gradient-based
optimization. A hybrid loss formulation is also proposed to combine SDSC with
MSE, improving stability and preserving amplitude where necessary. Experiments
on forecasting and classification benchmarks demonstrate that SDSC-based
pre-training achieves comparable or improved performance over MSE, particularly
in in-domain and low-resource scenarios. The results suggest that structural
fidelity in signal representations enhances the semantic representation
quality, supporting the consideration of structure-aware metrics as viable
alternatives to conventional distance-based methods.

Method: 采用PU学习框架，仅基于已处理的（正）单位，从无标记数据中高置信度地识别控制组。通过模拟和真实数据（如农业数据）验证方法。

Result: PU学习能成功识别控制组，并估计出接近真实值的ATE。

Conclusion: 该方法为观察性因果推断提供了新工具，尤其适用于难以进行随机实验的领域（如农业、环境科学）。

Abstract: In causal inference, whether through randomized controlled trials or
observational studies, access to both treated and control units is essential
for estimating the effect of a treatment on an outcome of interest. When
treatment assignment is random, the average treatment effect (ATE) can be
estimated directly by comparing outcomes between groups. In non-randomized
settings, various techniques are employed to adjust for confounding and
approximate the counterfactual scenario to recover an unbiased ATE. A common
challenge, especially in observational studies, is the absence of units clearly
labeled as controls-that is, units known not to have received the treatment. To
address this, we propose positive-unlabeled (PU) learning as a framework for
identifying, with high confidence, control units from a pool of unlabeled ones,
using only the available treated (positive) units. We evaluate this approach
using both simulated and real-world data. We construct a causal graph with
diverse relationships and use it to generate synthetic data under various
scenarios, assessing how reliably the method recovers control groups that allow
estimates of true ATE. We also apply our approach to real-world data on optimal
sowing and fertilizer treatments in sustainable agriculture. Our findings show
that PU learning can successfully identify control (negative) units from
unlabeled data based only on treated units and, through the resulting control
group, estimate an ATE that closely approximates the true value. This work has
important implications for observational causal inference, especially in fields
where randomized experiments are difficult or costly. In domains such as earth,
environmental, and agricultural sciences, it enables a plethora of
quasi-experiments by leveraging available earth observation and climate data,
particularly when treated units are available but control units are lacking.

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效推断非线性奖励结构，适用于无限时域问题，扩展了逆强化学习的应用范围。

Abstract: We consider the maximum causal entropy inverse reinforcement learning problem
for infinite-horizon stationary mean-field games, in which we model the unknown
reward function within a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. This allows the
inference of rich and potentially nonlinear reward structures directly from
expert demonstrations, in contrast to most existing inverse reinforcement
learning approaches for mean-field games that typically restrict the reward
function to a linear combination of a fixed finite set of basis functions. We
also focus on the infinite-horizon cost structure, whereas prior studies
primarily rely on finite-horizon formulations. We introduce a Lagrangian
relaxation to this maximum causal entropy inverse reinforcement learning
problem that enables us to reformulate it as an unconstrained log-likelihood
maximization problem, and obtain a solution \lk{via} a gradient ascent
algorithm. To illustrate the theoretical consistency of the algorithm, we
establish the smoothness of the log-likelihood objective by proving the
Fr\'echet differentiability of the related soft Bellman operators with respect
to the parameters in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method on a mean-field traffic routing game, where it
accurately recovers expert behavior.

Conclusion: 将自注意力置于基于亲和计算的更广泛范式中，统一了多种机器学习研究，并突出了其共同的数学基础。

Abstract: The self-attention mechanism, now central to deep learning architectures such
as Transformers, is a modern instance of a more general computational
principle: learning and using pairwise affinity matrices to control how
information flows through a model. This paper traces the conceptual origins of
self-attention across multiple domains, including computer vision, natural
language processing, and graph learning, through their shared reliance on an
affinity matrix, denoted as A. We highlight Infinite Feature Selection (Inf-FS)
as a foundational approach that generalizes the idea of affinity-based
weighting. Unlike the fixed dot-product structure used in Transformers, Inf-FS
defines A either through domain knowledge or by learning, and computes feature
relevance through multi-hop propagation over the affinity graph. From this
perspective, self-attention can be seen as a special case of Inf-FS: it uses a
single-hop affinity computation where A is dynamically built from token
similarities. We argue that the underlying structure, reasoning over pairwise
relationships, is preserved across both approaches, and the key differences lie
in how the affinity matrix is defined and applied. By situating self-attention
within the broader paradigm of affinity-based computation, we unify several
strands of machine learning research and highlight a common mathematical
foundation that underpins diverse models and tasks.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for various graph

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly used in surveillance,
logistics, agriculture, disaster management, and military operations. Accurate
detection and classification of UAV flight states, such as hovering, cruising,
ascending, or transitioning, which are essential for safe and effective
operations. However, conventional time series classification (TSC) methods
often lack robustness and generalization for dynamic UAV environments, while
state of the art(SOTA) models like Transformers and LSTM based architectures
typically require large datasets and entail high computational costs,
especially with high-dimensional data streams. This paper proposes a novel
framework that integrates a Transformer-based Generative Adversarial Network
(GAN) with Multiple Instance Locally Explainable Learning (MILET) to address
these challenges in UAV flight state classification. The Transformer encoder
captures long-range temporal dependencies and complex telemetry dynamics, while
the GAN module augments limited datasets with realistic synthetic samples. MIL
is incorporated to focus attention on the most discriminative input segments,
reducing noise and computational overhead. Experimental results show that the
proposed method achieves superior accuracy 96.5% on the DroneDetect dataset and
98.6% on the DroneRF dataset that outperforming other SOTA approaches. The
framework also demonstrates strong computational efficiency and robust
generalization across diverse UAV platforms and flight states, highlighting its
potential for real-time deployment in resource constrained environments.

### [222] [$k$-PCA for (non-squared) Euclidean Distances: Polynomial Time Approximation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14631)
*Daniel Greenhut,Dan Feldman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种多项式时间确定性算法，用于近似计算k-子空间中位数，其近似因子为√d，且运行时间与输入规模成多项式关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: k-子空间中位数比均值更稀疏且对噪声/异常值更鲁棒，但由于非凸性难以高效近似。

Method: 提出了一种多项式时间确定性算法，近似因子为√d。

Result: 算法在多项式时间内实现了对k-子空间中位数的近似计算。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅适用于k-子空间中位数问题，还可推广到其他相关范数问题。

Abstract: Given an integer $k\geq1$ and a set $P$ of $n$ points in $\REAL^d$, the
classic $k$-PCA (Principle Component Analysis) approximates the affine
\emph{$k$-subspace mean} of $P$, which is the $k$-dimensional affine linear
subspace that minimizes its sum of squared Euclidean distances
($\ell_{2,2}$-norm) over the points of $P$, i.e., the mean of these distances.
The \emph{$k$-subspace median} is the subspace that minimizes its sum of
(non-squared) Euclidean distances ($\ell_{2,1}$-mixed norm), i.e., their
median. The median subspace is usually more sparse and robust to noise/outliers
than the mean, but also much harder to approximate since, unlike the
$\ell_{z,z}$ (non-mixed) norms, it is non-convex for $k<d-1$.
  We provide the first polynomial-time deterministic algorithm whose both
running time and approximation factor are not exponential in $k$. More
precisely, the multiplicative approximation factor is $\sqrt{d}$, and the
running time is polynomial in the size of the input. We expect that our
technique would be useful for many other related problems, such as $\ell_{2,z}$
norm of distances for $z\not \in \br{1,2}$, e.g., $z=\infty$, and handling
outliers/sparsity.
  Open code and experimental results on real-world datasets are also provided.

Result: 实验显示Rec-AD显著提升计算吞吐量和实时检测性能，缩小攻击窗口并增加攻击成本。

Conclusion: Rec-AD增强了边缘计算能力和可扩展性，为智能电网安全提供技术支持。

Abstract: Deep learning models have been widely adopted for False Data Injection Attack
(FDIA) detection in smart grids due to their ability to capture unstructured
and sparse features. However, the increasing system scale and data
dimensionality introduce significant computational and memory burdens,
particularly in large-scale industrial datasets, limiting detection efficiency.
To address these issues, this paper proposes Rec-AD, a computationally
efficient framework that integrates Tensor Train decomposition with the Deep
Learning Recommendation Model (DLRM). Rec-AD enhances training and inference
efficiency through embedding compression, optimized data access via index
reordering, and a pipeline training mechanism that reduces memory communication
overhead. Fully compatible with PyTorch, Rec-AD can be integrated into existing
FDIA detection systems without code modifications. Experimental results show
that Rec-AD significantly improves computational throughput and real-time
detection performance, narrowing the attack window and increasing attacker
cost. These advancements strengthen edge computing capabilities and
scalability, providing robust technical support for smart grid security.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为AD-GCL的新型图对比学习框架，旨在解决现有方法在结构不平衡网络中对尾部异常检测的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于图对比学习的异常检测方法过于关注整体性能，而忽视了对结构不平衡的鲁棒性，尤其是对低度异常节点的检测不足。

Method: AD-GCL采用邻居修剪策略过滤噪声边，并通过异常引导的邻居补全扩大尾部节点的感知范围，同时引入视图内和视图间一致性损失增强表示。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，AD-GCL在整体、头部和尾部节点的异常检测中均表现出优越性。

Conclusion: AD-GCL显著提升了图异常检测在结构不平衡网络中的鲁棒性和适用性。

Abstract: The superiority of graph contrastive learning (GCL) has prompted its
application to anomaly detection tasks for more powerful risk warning systems.
Unfortunately, existing GCL-based models tend to excessively prioritize overall
detection performance while neglecting robustness to structural imbalance,
which can be problematic for many real-world networks following power-law
degree distributions. Particularly, GCL-based methods may fail to capture tail
anomalies (abnormal nodes with low degrees). This raises concerns about the
security and robustness of current anomaly detection algorithms and therefore
hinders their applicability in a variety of realistic high-risk scenarios. To
the best of our knowledge, research on the robustness of graph anomaly
detection to structural imbalance has received little scrutiny. To address the
above issues, this paper presents a novel GCL-based framework named AD-GCL. It
devises the neighbor pruning strategy to filter noisy edges for head nodes and
facilitate the detection of genuine tail nodes by aligning from head nodes to
forged tail nodes. Moreover, AD-GCL actively explores potential neighbors to
enlarge the receptive field of tail nodes through anomaly-guided neighbor
completion. We further introduce intra- and inter-view consistency loss of the
original and augmentation graph for enhanced representation. The performance
evaluation of the whole, head, and tail nodes on multiple datasets validates
the comprehensive superiority of the proposed AD-GCL in detecting both head
anomalies and tail anomalies.

Abstract: The exponential growth of spam text on the Internet necessitates robust
detection mechanisms to mitigate risks such as information leakage and social
instability. This work addresses two principal challenges: adversarial
strategies employed by spammers and the scarcity of labeled data. We propose a
novel spam-text detection framework GCC-Spam, which integrates three core
innovations. First, a character similarity network captures orthographic and
phonetic features to counter character-obfuscation attacks and furthermore
produces sentence embeddings for downstream classification. Second, contrastive
learning enhances discriminability by optimizing the latent-space distance
between spam and normal texts. Third, a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)
generates realistic pseudo-spam samples to alleviate data scarcity while
improving model robustness and classification accuracy. Extensive experiments
on real-world datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms baseline
approaches, achieving higher detection rates with significantly fewer labeled
examples.

Conclusion: SST-CL框架有效整合了EEG信号的时空特征，并通过课程学习适应动态情感强度，显著提升了情感识别性能。

Abstract: EEG-based emotion recognition plays an important role in developing adaptive
brain-computer communication systems, yet faces two fundamental challenges in
practical implementations: (1) effective integration of non-stationary
spatial-temporal neural patterns, (2) robust adaptation to dynamic emotional
intensity variations in real-world scenarios. This paper proposes SST-CL, a
novel framework integrating spatial-temporal transformers with curriculum
learning. Our method introduces two core components: a spatial encoder that
models inter-channel relationships and a temporal encoder that captures
multi-scale dependencies through windowed attention mechanisms, enabling
simultaneous extraction of spatial correlations and temporal dynamics from EEG
signals. Complementing this architecture, an intensity-aware curriculum
learning strategy progressively guides training from high-intensity to
low-intensity emotional states through dynamic sample scheduling based on a
dual difficulty assessment. Comprehensive experiments on three benchmark
datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across various emotional
intensity levels, with ablation studies confirming the necessity of both
architectural components and the curriculum learning mechanism.

Abstract: Detecting fraudulent credit card transactions remains a significant
challenge, due to the extreme class imbalance in real-world data and the often
subtle patterns that separate fraud from legitimate activity. Existing research
commonly attempts to address this by generating synthetic samples for the
minority class using approaches such as GANs, VAEs, or hybrid generative
models. However, these techniques, particularly when applied only to
minority-class data, tend to result in overconfident classifiers and poor
latent cluster separation, ultimately limiting real-world detection
performance. In this study, we propose the Causal Prototype Attention
Classifier (CPAC), an interpretable architecture that promotes class-aware
clustering and improved latent space structure through prototype-based
attention mechanisms and we will couple it with the encoder in a VAE-GAN
allowing it to offer a better cluster separation moving beyond post-hoc sample
augmentation. We compared CPAC-augmented models to traditional oversamplers,
such as SMOTE, as well as to state-of-the-art generative models, both with and
without CPAC-based latent classifiers. Our results show that classifier-guided
latent shaping with CPAC delivers superior performance, achieving an F1-score
of 93.14\% percent and recall of 90.18\%, along with improved latent cluster
separation. Further ablation studies and visualizations provide deeper insight
into the benefits and limitations of classifier-driven representation learning
for fraud detection. The codebase for this work will be available at final
submission.

Abstract: We address the problem of safe policy learning in multi-agent safety-critical
autonomous systems. In such systems, it is necessary for each agent to meet the
safety requirements at all times while also cooperating with other agents to
accomplish the task. Toward this end, we propose a safe Hierarchical
Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (HMARL) approach based on Control Barrier
Functions (CBFs). Our proposed hierarchical approach decomposes the overall
reinforcement learning problem into two levels learning joint cooperative
behavior at the higher level and learning safe individual behavior at the lower
or agent level conditioned on the high-level policy. Specifically, we propose a
skill-based HMARL-CBF algorithm in which the higher level problem involves
learning a joint policy over the skills for all the agents and the lower-level
problem involves learning policies to execute the skills safely with CBFs. We
validate our approach on challenging environment scenarios whereby a large
number of agents have to safely navigate through conflicting road networks.
Compared with existing state of the art methods, our approach significantly
improves the safety achieving near perfect (within 5%) success/safety rate
while also improving performance across all the environments.

Result: 调度决策导致截止时间违规率平均差异达41.7%，表明动态异构调度的必要性。

Conclusion: 工作负载感知的动态异构调度对高性能RTGen应用至关重要。

Abstract: The integration of generative AI models, particularly large language models
(LLMs), into real-time multi-model AI applications such as video conferencing
and gaming is giving rise to a new class of workloads: real-time generative AI
(RTGen). These workloads combine the compute intensity and dynamic execution
patterns of generative models with the stringent latency and concurrency
constraints of real-time inference. To meet the diverse demands of RTGen
workloads, modern edge platforms increasingly adopt heterogeneous
system-on-chip (SoC) architectures that integrate CPUs, GPUs, and NPUs. Despite
the potential of heterogeneous SoC, the scheduling space complexity and
performance implications of RTGen workloads on such platforms remain
underexplored. In this work, we perform a comprehensive characterization of
RTGen workloads on AMD's latest heterogeneous SoC, Ryzen AI. We construct
realistic multi-model scenarios inspired by industry use cases and profile
model performance across all available backends. Using this data, we evaluate
five scheduling policies and their impact on both real-time metrics (e.g.,
deadline violation rate) and LLM performance (e.g., time-to-first-token and
tokens-per-second). Our results show that scheduling decisions significantly
affect workload performance (e.g., leading to a 41.7% difference in deadline
violation rates on average), and highlight the need for scheduling strategies
that are aware of workload dynamics and hardware heterogeneity. Our findings
underscore the importance of workload-aware, dynamic heterogeneous scheduling
in enabling high-performance, on-device RTGen applications.

Motivation: 自动化定理证明（ATP）因状态和动作空间庞大而具有挑战性。尽管大型语言模型（LLMs）作为启发式方法表现出潜力，但缺乏正确性保证，且白盒方法发展滞后。

Method: 提出LeanTree，包括基于Lean 4语言的工具和分解后的中间状态数据集，支持并行搜索、状态重用和错误反馈。

Result: 初步结果表明，白盒方法在某些场景下优于黑盒方法。

Conclusion: LeanTree为ATP提供了更高效的白盒解决方案，展示了白盒方法的优势。

Abstract: Automated theorem proving (ATP) has been a classical problem in artificial
intelligence since its inception, yet it remains challenging due to its vast
state and action space. Large language models (LLMs) have recently emerged as a
promising heuristic for ATP, but they lack correctness guarantees and thus
require interaction with a proof verifier. Such interactions typically follow
one of two approaches: black-box interaction, which does not utilize
intermediate proof states, or white-box approaches, which allow for incremental
proof construction and examination of intermediate states. While black-box
approaches have directly benefited from recent LLM advances, white-box methods
have comparatively lagged behind. In this paper, we address this gap by
introducing LeanTree, which consists of (i) a tool built in the Lean 4 language
that factorizes complex proof states into simpler, independent branches, and
(ii) a dataset of these factorized intermediate states. Our white-box tooling
offers several advantages over black-box approaches: it simplifies evaluation,
reduces necessary context, generates richer training data, enables parallel
search across multiple states, supports efficient reuse of states, and provides
feedback in case of errors. Our preliminary results hint that white-box
approaches outperform black-box alternatives in some settings.

Result: 实验表明GRID显著提升后向转移，减少遗忘任务达80%，在T5和Flan-T5上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GRID为持续学习提供了高效、可扩展的解决方案，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Prompt-based continual learning (CL) offers a parameter-efficient way to
adapt large language models (LLMs) across task sequences. However, most
existing methods assume task-aware inference and maintain a growing list of
task-specific prompts, which limits scalability and hides latent forgetting. In
this work, we introduce GRID, a unified framework that addresses two key
limitations: (1) latent forgetting under task-agnostic inference, and (2)
prompt memory explosion as task sequences grow. GRID integrates a task-aware
decoding mechanism that improves backward transfer by leveraging representative
inputs, automatic task identification, and constrained decoding. Additionally,
we propose a gradient-based prompt selection strategy that compresses less
informative prompts into a single aggregated representation, enabling scalable
and memory-efficient lifelong learning. Extensive experiments across
short-sequence, long-sequence, and negative transfer benchmarks show that GRID
significantly improves backward transfer, achieves competitive forward
transfer, and reduces forgotten tasks by up to 80\%, outperforming
state-of-the-art methods on T5 and Flan-T5 backbones.

Conclusion: 研究提供了在动态环境中设计稳健且适应性强的可训练激活函数的实用原则。

Abstract: Trainable activation functions, whose parameters are optimized alongside
network weights, offer increased expressivity compared to fixed activation
functions. Specifically, trainable activation functions defined as ratios of
polynomials (rational functions) have been proposed to enhance plasticity in
reinforcement learning. However, their impact on training stability remains
unclear. In this work, we study trainable rational activations in both
reinforcement and continual learning settings. We find that while their
flexibility enhances adaptability, it can also introduce instability, leading
to overestimation in RL and feature collapse in longer continual learning
scenarios. Our main result is demonstrating a trade-off between expressivity
and plasticity in rational activations. To address this, we propose a
constrained variant that structurally limits excessive output scaling while
preserving adaptability. Experiments across MetaWorld and DeepMind Control
Suite (DMC) environments show that our approach improves training stability and
performance. In continual learning benchmarks, including MNIST with reshuffled
labels and Split CIFAR-100, we reveal how different constraints affect the
balance between expressivity and long-term retention. While preliminary
experiments in discrete action domains (e.g., Atari) did not show similar
instability, this suggests that the trade-off is particularly relevant for
continuous control. Together, our findings provide actionable design principles
for robust and adaptable trainable activations in dynamic, non-stationary
environments. Code available at:

Result: ASTRA调参简单、迭代次数少，比EKFAC近似更准确，显著提升TDA性能。

Conclusion: ASTRA通过改进iHVP近似精度，有效提升TDA方法的实用性和准确性。

Abstract: Training data attribution (TDA) provides insights into which training data is
responsible for a learned model behavior. Gradient-based TDA methods such as
influence functions and unrolled differentiation both involve a computation
that resembles an inverse Hessian-vector product (iHVP), which is difficult to
approximate efficiently. We introduce an algorithm (ASTRA) which uses the
EKFAC-preconditioner on Neumann series iterations to arrive at an accurate iHVP
approximation for TDA. ASTRA is easy to tune, requires fewer iterations than
Neumann series iterations, and is more accurate than EKFAC-based
approximations. Using ASTRA, we show that improving the accuracy of the iHVP
approximation can significantly improve TDA performance.

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models have long dominated the landscape of large
language models, driving progress across a wide range of tasks. Recently,
diffusion-based language models have emerged as a promising alternative, though
their advantages over AR models remain underexplored. In this paper, we
systematically study masked diffusion models in data-constrained settings-where
training involves repeated passes over limited data-and find that they
significantly outperform AR models when compute is abundant but data is scarce.
Diffusion models make better use of repeated data, achieving lower validation
loss and superior downstream performance. We interpret this advantage as
implicit data augmentation: masked diffusion exposes the model to a diverse
distribution of token orderings and prediction tasks, unlike AR's fixed
left-to-right factorization. We find new scaling laws for diffusion models and
derive a closed-form expression for the critical compute threshold at which
diffusion begins to outperform AR. These results suggest that when data, not
compute, is the bottleneck, diffusion models offer a compelling alternative to
the standard AR paradigm. Our code is available at:

Motivation: 现有自动化机器学习系统通常只关注单一最优模型，忽视了解释不确定性，这在以人为中心的可解释AI中至关重要。

Method: 提出Rashomon PDP框架，通过聚合Rashomon集中多个近优模型的PDP，生成包含解释变异的综合解释。

Result: 实验表明，Rashomon PDP在大多数情况下仅覆盖最优模型PDP的不到70%，揭示了单一模型解释的局限性。

Conclusion: Rashomon PDP通过补充被忽视的信息，提高了模型解释的可靠性和可信度，尤其适用于高风险领域。

Abstract: Automated machine learning systems efficiently streamline model selection but
often focus on a single best-performing model, overlooking explanation
uncertainty, an essential concern in human centered explainable AI. To address
this, we propose a novel framework that incorporates model multiplicity into
explanation generation by aggregating partial dependence profiles (PDP) from a
set of near optimal models, known as the Rashomon set. The resulting Rashomon
PDP captures interpretive variability and highlights areas of disagreement,
providing users with a richer, uncertainty aware view of feature effects. To
evaluate its usefulness, we introduce two quantitative metrics, the coverage
rate and the mean width of confidence intervals, to evaluate the consistency
between the standard PDP and the proposed Rashomon PDP. Experiments on 35
regression datasets from the OpenML CTR23 benchmark suite show that in most
cases, the Rashomon PDP covers less than 70% of the best model's PDP,
underscoring the limitations of single model explanations. Our findings suggest
that Rashomon PDP improves the reliability and trustworthiness of model
interpretations by adding additional information that would otherwise be
neglected. This is particularly useful in high stakes domains where
transparency and confidence are critical.

Motivation: 高保真仿真和物理实验成本高，限制了其在全局敏感性分析和优化中的应用，因此需要高效的代理模型（如GP）提供不确定性预测。

Conclusion: 论文提出的GP采样方法为工程优化提供了高效工具，扩展了GP在工程领域的应用。

Abstract: High-fidelity simulations and physical experiments are essential for
engineering analysis and design. However, their high cost often limits their
applications in two critical tasks: global sensitivity analysis (GSA) and
optimization. This limitation motivates the common use of Gaussian processes
(GPs) as proxy regression models to provide uncertainty-aware predictions based
on a limited number of high-quality observations. GPs naturally enable
efficient sampling strategies that support informed decision-making under
uncertainty by extracting information from a subset of possible functions for
the model of interest. Despite their popularity in machine learning and
statistics communities, sampling from GPs has received little attention in the
community of engineering optimization. In this paper, we present the
formulation and detailed implementation of two notable sampling methods --
random Fourier features and pathwise conditioning -- for generating posterior
samples from GPs. Alternative approaches are briefly described. Importantly, we
detail how the generated samples can be applied in GSA, single-objective
optimization, and multi-objective optimization. We show successful applications
of these sampling methods through a series of numerical examples.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了方向性作为人工神经网络的归纳偏置的作用，通过修剪技术诱导方向性，而非硬编码，发现方向性并非学习的前提，但可能是梯度下降和稀疏化可发现的有利偏置。


<details>

Motivation: 受生物大脑中循环电路的普遍性启发，研究方向性是否对人工神经网络有帮助。

Method: 形式化了一个全连接的感知层（数学上等价于权重绑定的循环神经网络），并通过修剪技术诱导方向性。

Result: 修剪方案成功诱导了神经元间信息流的更大拓扑顺序，且不影响性能。

Conclusion: 方向性并非学习的前提，但可能是梯度下降和稀疏化可发现的有利归纳偏置。

Abstract: Inspired by the prevalence of recurrent circuits in biological brains, we
investigate the degree to which directionality is a helpful inductive bias for
artificial neural networks. Taking directionality as topologically-ordered
information flow between neurons, we formalise a perceptron layer with
all-to-all connections (mathematically equivalent to a weight-tied recurrent
neural network) and demonstrate that directionality, a hallmark of modern
feed-forward networks, can be induced rather than hard-wired by applying
appropriate pruning techniques. Across different random seeds our pruning
schemes successfully induce greater topological ordering in information flow
between neurons without compromising performance, suggesting that
directionality is not a prerequisite for learning, but may be an advantageous
inductive bias discoverable by gradient descent and sparsification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自监督特征学习和预训练方法在强化学习中常依赖互信息技能学习（MISL），但其表示和互信息参数化的理论作用尚不明确。

Method: 通过可识别表示学习的视角研究MISL，聚焦于对比后继特征（CSF）方法，证明了其能恢复环境的真实特征。

Result: CSF能够从状态和像素中恢复环境的真实特征，并揭示了不同互信息目标和熵正则化的影响。

Conclusion: 研究为强化学习中的表示学习提供了首个可识别性保证，并验证了CSF方法的有效性。

Abstract: Self-supervised feature learning and pretraining methods in reinforcement
learning (RL) often rely on information-theoretic principles, termed mutual
information skill learning (MISL). These methods aim to learn a representation
of the environment while also incentivizing exploration thereof. However, the
role of the representation and mutual information parametrization in MISL is
not yet well understood theoretically. Our work investigates MISL through the
lens of identifiable representation learning by focusing on the Contrastive
Successor Features (CSF) method. We prove that CSF can provably recover the
environment's ground-truth features up to a linear transformation due to the
inner product parametrization of the features and skill diversity in a
discriminative sense. This first identifiability guarantee for representation
learning in RL also helps explain the implications of different mutual
information objectives and the downsides of entropy regularizers. We
empirically validate our claims in MuJoCo and DeepMind Control and show how CSF
provably recovers the ground-truth features both from states and pixels.

TL;DR: CXR-TFT是一个多模态框架，结合稀疏时间点的胸部X光和临床数据，预测ICU患者异常X光结果的轨迹。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的胸部X光分析工具无法捕捉时间动态，限制了其在ICU中的应用。

Method: CXR-TFT通过视觉编码器生成潜在嵌入，并与高频临床数据对齐，使用Transformer模型预测未来X光结果。

Result: 在2万ICU患者的回顾性研究中，CXR-TFT能提前12小时高准确率预测异常X光结果。

Conclusion: CXR-TFT通过提供时间分辨率的预测，有望改善急性呼吸窘迫综合征等时间敏感病症的管理。

Abstract: In intensive care units (ICUs), patients with complex clinical conditions
require vigilant monitoring and prompt interventions. Chest X-rays (CXRs) are a
vital diagnostic tool, providing insights into clinical trajectories, but their
irregular acquisition limits their utility. Existing tools for CXR
interpretation are constrained by cross-sectional analysis, failing to capture
temporal dynamics. To address this, we introduce CXR-TFT, a novel multi-modal
framework that integrates temporally sparse CXR imaging and radiology reports
with high-frequency clinical data, such as vital signs, laboratory values, and
respiratory flow sheets, to predict the trajectory of CXR findings in
critically ill patients. CXR-TFT leverages latent embeddings from a vision
encoder that are temporally aligned with hourly clinical data through
interpolation. A transformer model is then trained to predict CXR embeddings at
each hour, conditioned on previous embeddings and clinical measurements. In a
retrospective study of 20,000 ICU patients, CXR-TFT demonstrated high accuracy
in forecasting abnormal CXR findings up to 12 hours before they became
radiographically evident. This predictive capability in clinical data holds
significant potential for enhancing the management of time-sensitive conditions
like acute respiratory distress syndrome, where early intervention is crucial
and diagnoses are often delayed. By providing distinctive temporal resolution
in prognostic CXR analysis, CXR-TFT offers actionable 'whole patient' insights
that can directly improve clinical outcomes.

TL;DR: 本文研究了语言模型中的记忆化问题，探讨了记忆化是否可避免以及其隐私威胁是否被夸大，并提出了新的上下文记忆化概念。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 关注隐私威胁，研究记忆化在语言学习中的必要性及其实际威胁程度。

Method: 重新审视了基于回忆和反事实的记忆化度量，并提出了上下文记忆化概念，通过实验验证了不同记忆化度量的差异。

Result: 实验表明，记忆化度量对字符串的记忆顺序存在分歧，优化学习无法完全避免记忆化，且改进学习会减少上下文和反事实记忆化但增加基于回忆的记忆化。

Conclusion: 部分基于回忆的记忆化字符串实际不构成隐私威胁，上下文和反事实记忆化更准确地反映了记忆化的本质。

Abstract: Concerned with privacy threats, memorization in LLMs is often seen as
undesirable, specifically for learning. In this paper, we study whether
memorization can be avoided when optimally learning a language, and whether the
privacy threat posed by memorization is exaggerated or not. To this end, we
re-examine existing privacy-focused measures of memorization, namely
recollection-based and counterfactual memorization, along with a newly proposed
contextual memorization.
  Relating memorization to local over-fitting during learning, contextual
memorization aims to disentangle memorization from the contextual learning
ability of LLMs. Informally, a string is contextually memorized if its
recollection due to training exceeds the optimal contextual recollection, a
learned threshold denoting the best contextual learning without training.
Conceptually, contextual recollection avoids the fallacy of recollection-based
memorization, where any form of high recollection is a sign of memorization.
Theoretically, contextual memorization relates to counterfactual memorization,
but imposes stronger conditions. Memorization measures differ in outcomes and
information requirements.
  Experimenting on 18 LLMs from 6 families and multiple formal languages of
different entropy, we show that (a) memorization measures disagree on
memorization order of varying frequent strings, (b) optimal learning of a
language cannot avoid partial memorization of training strings, and (c)
improved learning decreases contextual and counterfactual memorization but
increases recollection-based memorization. Finally, (d) we revisit existing
reports of memorized strings by recollection that neither pose a privacy threat
nor are contextually or counterfactually memorized.

Motivation: 当前的后训练方法（如SFT）在泛化能力上表现不佳，倾向于记忆而非可迁移学习。

Method: 采用统一的强化学习框架，结合规则奖励和LLM-as-a-Judge评估的生成偏好信号，并引入课程学习策略。

Result: 实验结果显示，课程学习在四个领域中性能提升了5.2%（相比联合训练）和9.1%（相比模型合并）。

Conclusion: 任务感知采样和混合监督对扩展基于RL的后训练方法至关重要。

Abstract: The advancement of general-purpose artificial intelligence relies on large
language models (LLMs) that excel across a wide range of tasks, from structured
reasoning to creative generation. However, post-training methods like
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) often struggle with generalization, favoring
memorization over transferable learning. In this work, we introduce Omni-Think,
a unified reinforcement learning (RL) framework that enhances LLM performance
across diverse tasks by combining rule-based verifiable rewards with generative
preference signals via LLM-as-a-Judge evaluations. Our approach enables
consistent optimization across task types and scales RL-based training to
subjective domains. We further investigate training strategies, demonstrating
that a curriculum-based progression that orders tasks from structured to
open-ended improves performance and reduces forgetting. Experimental results
across four domains reveal that curriculum learning improves performance by
5.2\% over joint training and 9.1\% over model merging. These results highlight
the importance of task-aware sampling and hybrid supervision in scaling
RL-based post-training for general-purpose LLMs.

Conclusion: 尽管是探索性研究，但展示了LLM在图推理中的潜力，为可解释的语言驱动金融犯罪分析奠定了基础。

Abstract: The complexity and interconnectivity of entities involved in money laundering
demand investigative reasoning over graph-structured data. This paper explores
the use of large language models (LLMs) as reasoning engines over localized
subgraphs extracted from a financial knowledge graph. We propose a lightweight
pipeline that retrieves k-hop neighborhoods around entities of interest,
serializes them into structured text, and prompts an LLM via few-shot
in-context learning to assess suspiciousness and generate justifications. Using
synthetic anti-money laundering (AML) scenarios that reflect common laundering
behaviors, we show that LLMs can emulate analyst-style logic, highlight red
flags, and provide coherent explanations. While this study is exploratory, it
illustrates the potential of LLM-based graph reasoning in AML and lays
groundwork for explainable, language-driven financial crime analytics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的等变性研究仅适用于静态变换和前馈网络，无法直接应用于序列模型（如RNNs）和时间参数化的序列变换。

Method: 扩展等变网络理论，引入流等变性（flow equivariance），并设计相应的RNN模型。

Result: 实验表明，具有流等变性的模型在训练速度、长度泛化和速度泛化方面显著优于非等变模型。

Conclusion: 这是构建尊重时间参数化对称性的序列模型的第一步，为未来研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Data arrives at our senses as a continuous stream, smoothly transforming from
one instant to the next. These smooth transformations can be viewed as
continuous symmetries of the environment that we inhabit, defining equivalence
relations between stimuli over time. In machine learning, neural network
architectures that respect symmetries of their data are called equivariant and
have provable benefits in terms of generalization ability and sample
efficiency. To date, however, equivariance has been considered only for static
transformations and feed-forward networks, limiting its applicability to
sequence models, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and corresponding
time-parameterized sequence transformations. In this work, we extend
equivariant network theory to this regime of `flows' -- one-parameter Lie
subgroups capturing natural transformations over time, such as visual motion.
We begin by showing that standard RNNs are generally not flow equivariant:
their hidden states fail to transform in a geometrically structured manner for
moving stimuli. We then show how flow equivariance can be introduced, and
demonstrate that these models significantly outperform their non-equivariant
counterparts in terms of training speed, length generalization, and velocity
generalization, on both next step prediction and sequence classification. We
present this work as a first step towards building sequence models that respect
the time-parameterized symmetries which govern the world around us.

Method: 通过教师模型生成仅包含数字序列的数据集，训练学生模型观察其是否学习到教师模型的行为特征。

Result: 学生模型确实能从过滤后的数据中学习到教师模型的行为特征，这种现象在不同类型的数据（如代码或推理痕迹）中均存在。

Conclusion: 潜意识学习是一种普遍现象，可能成为AI开发中的潜在陷阱，即使通过数据过滤也无法完全避免。

Abstract: We study subliminal learning, a surprising phenomenon where language models
transmit behavioral traits via semantically unrelated data. In our main
experiments, a "teacher" model with some trait T (such as liking owls or being
misaligned) generates a dataset consisting solely of number sequences.
Remarkably, a "student" model trained on this dataset learns T. This occurs
even when the data is filtered to remove references to T. We observe the same
effect when training on code or reasoning traces generated by the same teacher
model. However, we do not observe the effect when the teacher and student have
different base models. To help explain our findings, we prove a theoretical
result showing that subliminal learning occurs in all neural networks under
certain conditions, and demonstrate subliminal learning in a simple MLP
classifier. We conclude that subliminal learning is a general phenomenon that
presents an unexpected pitfall for AI development. Distillation could propagate
unintended traits, even when developers try to prevent this via data filtering.

Abstract: Foundation models have emerged as a powerful approach for processing

systematically compared eight foundation models, encompassing both unimodal and
multimodal models, as well as domain-specific and general-purpose variants. Our
findings demonstrate that incorporating multiple data modalities leads to
consistent improvements in predictive performance without introducing
additional bias. Through this benchmark, we aim to support the development of

Motivation: 探索自适应边距是否能通过调整相似性阈值，改善时间序列表示学习中相邻但不相似时间步的分离效果，从而提升下游任务性能。

Method: 在对比损失函数中引入自适应边距（eMargin），并在三个基准数据集上评估其对聚类和分类性能的影响。

Result: eMargin在无监督聚类指标上优于基线，但在下游分类任务中表现不佳。

Conclusion: 无监督聚类指标的高分并不总能转化为下游任务的有效性，自适应边距的设计需进一步优化。

Abstract: We revisit previous contrastive learning frameworks to investigate the effect
of introducing an adaptive margin into the contrastive loss function for time
series representation learning. Specifically, we explore whether an adaptive
margin (eMargin), adjusted based on a predefined similarity threshold, can
improve the separation between adjacent but dissimilar time steps and
subsequently lead to better performance in downstream tasks. Our study
evaluates the impact of this modification on clustering performance and
classification in three benchmark datasets. Our findings, however, indicate
that achieving high scores on unsupervised clustering metrics does not
necessarily imply that the learned embeddings are meaningful or effective in
downstream tasks. To be specific, eMargin added to InfoNCE consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in unsupervised clustering metrics, but
struggles to achieve competitive results in downstream classification with
linear probing. The source code is publicly available at

Motivation: 探讨RLVR是否能真正扩展模型的推理能力，还是仅放大已知高奖励输出以提高精确性。

Method: 结合理论和实证研究，分析RLVR对模型支持范围和探索能力的影响。

Result: RLVR虽提高pass@1，但支持范围缩小，可能忽略正确但低概率的解；答案级熵下降表明收敛到更少解。

Conclusion: RLVR在扩展推理能力上存在潜在限制，未来需探索新算法以突破这些限制。

Abstract: Recent advances in large reasoning models highlight Reinforcement Learning
with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) as a promising method for enhancing AI's
capabilities, particularly in solving complex logical tasks. However, it
remains unclear whether RLVR truly expands a model's reasoning boundary or
merely amplifies high-reward outputs that the base model already knows for
improved precision. This study presents a theoretical and empirical
investigation that provides fresh insights into the potential limits of RLVR.
First, we offer a new theoretical perspective that RLVR is constrained by the
base model's support-unable to sample solutions with zero initial
probability-and operates as a conservative reweighting mechanism that may
restrict the discovery of entirely original solutions. We also identify an
entropy-reward tradeoff: while RLVR reliably enhances precision, it may
progressively narrow exploration and potentially overlook correct yet
underrepresented solutions. Extensive empirical experiments validate that while
RLVR consistently improves pass@1, the shrinkage of empirical support generally
outweighs the expansion of empirical support under larger sampling budgets,
failing to recover correct answers that were previously accessible to the base
model. Interestingly, we also observe that while RLVR sometimes increases
token-level entropy, resulting in greater uncertainty at each generation step,
answer-level entropy declines, indicating that these seemingly more uncertain
paths ultimately converge onto a smaller set of distinct answers. Taken
together, these findings reveal potential limits of RLVR in extending reasoning
horizons. Breaking this invisible leash may require future algorithmic
innovations such as explicit exploration mechanisms or hybrid strategies that
seed probability mass into underrepresented solution regions.

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHR) contain valuable clinical information for
predicting patient outcomes and guiding healthcare decisions. However,
effectively modeling Electronic Health Records (EHRs) requires addressing data
heterogeneity and complex temporal patterns. Standard approaches often struggle
with irregular time intervals between clinical events. We propose TALE-EHR, a
Transformer-based framework featuring a novel time-aware attention mechanism
that explicitly models continuous temporal gaps to capture fine-grained
sequence dynamics. To complement this temporal modeling with robust semantics,
TALE-EHR leverages embeddings derived from standardized code descriptions using
a pre-trained Large Language Model (LLM), providing a strong foundation for
understanding clinical concepts. Experiments on the MIMIC-IV and PIC dataset
demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on tasks
such as disease progression forecasting. TALE-EHR underscores the benefit of
integrating explicit, continuous temporal modeling with strong semantic
representations provides a powerful solution for advancing EHR analysis.

Conclusion: GraphTM 展示了图表示学习和深度子句为 TM 学习带来的新可能性，适用于多种复杂任务。

Abstract: Pattern recognition with concise and flat AND-rules makes the Tsetlin Machine
(TM) both interpretable and efficient, while the power of Tsetlin automata
enables accuracy comparable to deep learning on an increasing number of
datasets. We introduce the Graph Tsetlin Machine (GraphTM) for learning
interpretable deep clauses from graph-structured input. Moving beyond flat,
fixed-length input, the GraphTM gets more versatile, supporting sequences,
grids, relations, and multimodality. Through message passing, the GraphTM
builds nested deep clauses to recognize sub-graph patterns with exponentially
fewer clauses, increasing both interpretability and data utilization. For image
classification, GraphTM preserves interpretability and achieves 3.86%-points
higher accuracy on CIFAR-10 than a convolutional TM. For tracking action
coreference, faced with increasingly challenging tasks, GraphTM outperforms
other reinforcement learning methods by up to 20.6%-points. In recommendation
systems, it tolerates increasing noise to a greater extent than a Graph
Convolutional Neural Network (GCN), e.g., for noise ratio 0.1, GraphTM obtains
accuracy 89.86% compared to GCN's 70.87%. Finally, for viral genome sequence
data, GraphTM is competitive with BiLSTM-CNN and GCN accuracy-wise, training
2.5x faster than GCN. The GraphTM's application to these varied fields
demonstrates how graph representation learning and deep clauses bring new
possibilities for TM learning.

Result: 在MNIST图像重建任务中，该方法有效保留了任务相关性能，即使大幅剪枝后模型仍可用。

Conclusion: 该框架成功解决了结构化剪枝中性能保持的挑战，为模型压缩提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) offer significant versatility and performance
benefits, but their widespread adoption is often hindered by high model
complexity and computational demands. Model compression techniques such as
pruning have emerged as promising solutions to these challenges. However, it
remains critical to ensure that application-specific performance
characteristics are preserved during compression. In structured pruning, where
groups of structurally coherent elements are removed, conventional importance
metrics frequently fail to maintain these essential performance attributes. In
this work, we propose an enhanced importance metric framework that not only
reduces model size but also explicitly accounts for application-specific
performance constraints. We employ multiple strategies to determine the optimal
pruning magnitude for each group, ensuring a balance between compression and
task performance. Our approach is evaluated on an autoencoder tasked with
reconstructing MNIST images. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed
method effectively preserves task-relevant performance, maintaining the model's
usability even after substantial pruning, by satisfying the required
application-specific criteria.

Abstract: One of the key obstacles in traditional deep learning is the reduction in
model transparency caused by increasingly intricate model functions, which can
lead to problems such as overfitting and excessive confidence in predictions.
With the advent of quantum machine learning offering possible advances in
computational power and latent space complexity, we notice the same opaque
behavior. Despite significant research in classical contexts, there has been
little advancement in addressing the black-box nature of quantum machine
learning. Consequently, we approach this gap by building upon existing work in
classical uncertainty quantification and initial explorations in quantum
Bayesian modeling to theoretically develop and empirically evaluate techniques
to map classical uncertainty quantification methods to the quantum machine
learning domain. Our findings emphasize the necessity of leveraging classical
insights into uncertainty quantification to include uncertainty awareness in
the process of designing new quantum machine learning models.

TL;DR: FedWCM是一种动态调整动量的方法，解决联邦学习中非独立同分布数据导致的模型偏差和收敛问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习在非独立同分布数据（尤其是长尾分布）下表现不佳，传统动量方法难以解决偏差和收敛问题。

Method: 提出FedWCM，通过动态调整动量，结合全局和每轮数据，纠正长尾分布带来的方向偏差。

Result: 实验表明FedWCM解决了不收敛问题，优于现有方法，提升了联邦学习在数据不平衡下的效率和效果。

Conclusion: FedWCM有效解决了联邦学习中的长尾数据问题，提高了模型性能和收敛性。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables decentralized model training while preserving
data privacy. Despite its benefits, FL faces challenges with non-identically
distributed (non-IID) data, especially in long-tailed scenarios with imbalanced
class samples. Momentum-based FL methods, often used to accelerate FL
convergence, struggle with these distributions, resulting in biased models and
making FL hard to converge. To understand this challenge, we conduct extensive
investigations into this phenomenon, accompanied by a layer-wise analysis of
neural network behavior. Based on these insights, we propose FedWCM, a method
that dynamically adjusts momentum using global and per-round data to correct
directional biases introduced by long-tailed distributions. Extensive
experiments show that FedWCM resolves non-convergence issues and outperforms
existing methods, enhancing FL's efficiency and effectiveness in handling
client heterogeneity and data imbalance.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为FedClusAvg的隐私保护联邦学习框架，用于在非独立同分布（Non-IID）和资源受限的环境中提高虚假数据注入攻击（FDIA）的检测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虚假数据注入攻击（FDIAs）对智能电网构成严重安全威胁，而传统集中式训练方法存在隐私风险、数据共享限制和高传输成本等问题。

Method: FedClusAvg采用基于聚类的分层抽样和分层通信（客户端-子服务器-服务器）机制，结合局部训练和加权参数聚合，以提升模型泛化能力并降低通信开销。

Result: 实验结果表明，FedClusAvg在异构数据分布下提高了检测精度，同时显著减少了通信轮次和带宽消耗。

Conclusion: 该研究为大规模分布式电力系统中的FDIA检测提供了一种安全高效的解决方案。

Abstract: False Data Injection Attacks (FDIAs) pose severe security risks to smart
grids by manipulating measurement data collected from spatially distributed
devices such as SCADA systems and PMUs. These measurements typically exhibit
Non-Independent and Identically Distributed (Non-IID) characteristics across
different regions, which significantly challenges the generalization ability of
detection models. Traditional centralized training approaches not only face
privacy risks and data sharing constraints but also incur high transmission
costs, limiting their scalability and deployment feasibility. To address these
issues, this paper proposes a privacy-preserving federated learning framework,
termed Federated Cluster Average (FedClusAvg), designed to improve FDIA
detection in Non-IID and resource-constrained environments. FedClusAvg
incorporates cluster-based stratified sampling and hierarchical communication
(client-subserver-server) to enhance model generalization and reduce
communication overhead. By enabling localized training and weighted parameter
aggregation, the algorithm achieves accurate model convergence without
centralizing sensitive data. Experimental results on benchmark smart grid
datasets demonstrate that FedClusAvg not only improves detection accuracy under
heterogeneous data distributions but also significantly reduces communication
rounds and bandwidth consumption. This work provides an effective solution for
secure and efficient FDIA detection in large-scale distributed power systems.

Method: 提出Time-RA任务，利用LLMs实现生成式推理；构建RATs40K数据集，包含多模态数据和精细标注；采用GPT-4驱动的标注框架。

Result: 实验表明当前LLMs和多模态LLMs的能力与局限，强调监督微调的重要性。

Conclusion: Time-RA和RATs40K为可解释的时间序列异常检测和推理提供了新方向。

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection is critical across various domains, yet current
approaches often limit analysis to mere binary anomaly classification without
detailed categorization or further explanatory reasoning. To address these
limitations, we propose a novel task, Time-series Reasoning for Anomaly
(Time-RA) that transforms classical time series anomaly detection from a
discriminative into a generative, reasoning-intensive task leveraging Large
Language Models (LLMs). Also, we introduce the first real-world multimodal
benchmark dataset, RATs40K, explicitly annotated for anomaly reasoning,
comprising approximately 40,000 samples across 10 real-world domains. Each
sample includes numeric time series data, contextual text information, and
visual representations, each annotated with fine-grained categories (14 types
for univariate anomalies and 6 for multivariate anomalies) and structured
explanatory reasoning. We develop a sophisticated annotation framework
utilizing ensemble-generated labels refined through GPT-4-driven feedback,
ensuring accuracy and interpretability. Extensive benchmarking of LLMs and
multimodal LLMs demonstrates the capabilities and limitations of current
models, highlighting the critical role of supervised fine-tuning. Our dataset
and task pave the way for significant advancements in interpretable time series
anomaly detection and reasoning.

Motivation: 现有深度学习模型在检测不良行为者时对输入序列的微小变化敏感，缺乏对抗攻击的鲁棒性。

Method: ROBAD结合Transformer编码器和解码器块，分别捕获帖子级局部信息和序列级全局信息，并通过对比学习增强分类层以模拟攻击者行为。

Result: 在Yelp和Wikipedia数据集上的实验表明，ROBAD能有效抵御最先进的对抗攻击，准确检测不良行为者。

Conclusion: ROBAD通过局部-全局信息捕获和对抗性训练，显著提升了模型在对抗环境下的鲁棒性和检测能力。

Abstract: Detecting bad actors is critical to ensure the safety and integrity of
internet platforms. Several deep learning-based models have been developed to
identify such users. These models should not only accurately detect bad actors,
but also be robust against adversarial attacks that aim to evade detection.
However, past deep learning-based detection models do not meet the robustness
requirement because they are sensitive to even minor changes in the input
sequence. To address this issue, we focus on (1) improving the model
understanding capability and (2) enhancing the model knowledge such that the
model can recognize potential input modifications when making predictions. To
achieve these goals, we create a novel transformer-based classification model,
called ROBAD (RObust adversary-aware local-global attended Bad Actor Detection
model), which uses the sequence of user posts to generate user embedding to
detect bad actors. Particularly, ROBAD first leverages the transformer encoder
block to encode each post bidirectionally, thus building a post embedding to
capture the local information at the post level. Next, it adopts the
transformer decoder block to model the sequential pattern in the post
embeddings by using the attention mechanism, which generates the sequence
embedding to obtain the global information at the sequence level. Finally, to
enrich the knowledge of the model, embeddings of modified sequences by mimicked
attackers are fed into a contrastive-learning-enhanced classification layer for
sequence prediction. In essence, by capturing the local and global information
(i.e., the post and sequence information) and leveraging the mimicked behaviors
of bad actors in training, ROBAD can be robust to adversarial attacks.
Extensive experiments on Yelp and Wikipedia datasets show that ROBAD can
effectively detect bad actors when under state-of-the-art adversarial attacks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何通过强化学习提升流匹配策略的性能，超越由次优策略（如人类操作员）生成的演示数据。

Method: 提出了两种方法：奖励加权流匹配（RWFM）和基于学习奖励替代的组相对策略优化（GRPO），并在模拟的单轮动力学任务中进行了测试。

Result: 两种方法均显著提升了性能，GRPO方法在成本上比单纯的模仿学习流匹配（ILFM）减少了50%至85%。

Conclusion: 强化学习可以有效提升流匹配策略的性能，GRPO方法在减少成本方面表现尤为突出。

Abstract: Flow-matching policies have emerged as a powerful paradigm for generalist
robotics. These models are trained to imitate an action chunk, conditioned on
sensor observations and textual instructions. Often, training demonstrations
are generated by a suboptimal policy, such as a human operator. This work
explores training flow-matching policies via reinforcement learning to surpass
the original demonstration policy performance. We particularly note
minimum-time control as a key application and present a simple scheme for
variable-horizon flow-matching planning. We then introduce two families of
approaches: a simple Reward-Weighted Flow Matching (RWFM) scheme and a Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) approach with a learned reward surrogate.
Our policies are trained on an illustrative suite of simulated unicycle
dynamics tasks, and we show that both approaches dramatically improve upon the
suboptimal demonstrator performance, with the GRPO approach in particular
generally incurring between $50\%$ and $85\%$ less cost than a naive Imitation
Learning Flow Matching (ILFM) approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电力市场等波动性强的领域中，预测模型的不确定性量化对降低风险至关重要，但现有机器学习方法缺乏不确定性估计。

Method: 基于Quantile Regression Averaging (QRA)框架，引入随机顺序约束，提出Isotonic Quantile Regression Averaging (iQRA)。

Result: 在德国日前电力市场的预测研究中，iQRA在可靠性和锐度上均优于现有后处理方法，且能生成多置信水平的校准预测区间。

Conclusion: iQRA通过等渗正则化降低了分位数回归问题的复杂度，并提供了一种无需超参数选择的变量选择方法。

Abstract: Quantifying the uncertainty of forecasting models is essential to assess and
mitigate the risks associated with data-driven decisions, especially in
volatile domains such as electricity markets. Machine learning methods can
provide highly accurate electricity price forecasts, critical for informing the
decisions of market participants. However, these models often lack uncertainty
estimates, which limits the ability of decision makers to avoid unnecessary
risks. In this paper, we propose a novel method for generating probabilistic
forecasts from ensembles of point forecasts, called Isotonic Quantile
Regression Averaging (iQRA). Building on the established framework of Quantile
Regression Averaging (QRA), we introduce stochastic order constraints to
improve forecast accuracy, reliability, and computational costs. In an
extensive forecasting study of the German day-ahead electricity market, we show
that iQRA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art postprocessing methods in
terms of both reliability and sharpness. It produces well-calibrated prediction
intervals across multiple confidence levels, providing superior reliability to
all benchmark methods, particularly coverage-based conformal prediction. In
addition, isotonic regularization decreases the complexity of the quantile
regression problem and offers a hyperparameter-free approach to variable
selection.

Motivation: 在强化学习等应用中，价值函数的梯度不确定性普遍存在，但传统鲁棒控制理论未明确处理这一问题。

Result: 证明了经典假设在梯度不确定性下的失效，提出了GURAC算法并验证其稳定性。

Conclusion: 该研究为鲁棒控制提供了新方向，对强化学习和计算金融等领域具有重要意义。

Abstract: We introduce a novel extension to robust control theory that explicitly
addresses uncertainty in the value function's gradient, a form of uncertainty
endemic to applications like reinforcement learning where value functions are
approximated. We formulate a zero-sum dynamic game where an adversary perturbs
both system dynamics and the value function gradient, leading to a new, highly
nonlinear partial differential equation: the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman-Isaacs
Equation with Gradient Uncertainty (GU-HJBI). We establish its well-posedness
by proving a comparison principle for its viscosity solutions under a uniform
ellipticity condition. Our analysis of the linear-quadratic (LQ) case yields a
key insight: we prove that the classical quadratic value function assumption
fails for any non-zero gradient uncertainty, fundamentally altering the problem
structure. A formal perturbation analysis characterizes the non-polynomial
correction to the value function and the resulting nonlinearity of the optimal
control law, which we validate with numerical studies. Finally, we bridge
theory to practice by proposing a novel Gradient-Uncertainty-Robust
Actor-Critic (GURAC) algorithm, accompanied by an empirical study demonstrating
its effectiveness in stabilizing training. This work provides a new direction
for robust control, holding significant implications for fields where function
approximation is common, including reinforcement learning and computational
finance.

Result: 实验表明AnalogFed在性能和隐私保护上与集中式基线相当，生成式AI模型表现出高效和可扩展性。

Conclusion: AnalogFed为模拟电路设计的协作创新提供了可行方案，解决了数据隐私和碎片化问题。

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in AI/ML offer exciting opportunities to revolutionize
analog design automation through data-driven approaches. In particular,
researchers are increasingly fascinated by harnessing the power of generative
AI to automate the discovery of novel analog circuit topologies. Unlocking the
full potential of generative AI in these data-driven discoveries requires
access to large and diverse datasets.Yet, there is a significant barrier in the
analog domain--Analog circuit design is inherently proprietary, involving not
only confidential circuit structures but also the underlying commercial
semiconductor processes. As a result, current generative AI research is largely
confined to individual researchers who construct small, narrowly focused
private datasets. This fragmentation severely limits collaborative innovation
and impedes progress across the research community. To address these
challenges, we propose AnalogFed. AnalogFed enables collaborative topology
discovery across decentralized clients (e.g., individual researchers or
institutions) without requiring the sharing of raw private data. To make this
vision practical, we introduce a suite of techniques tailored to the unique
challenges of applying FedL in analog design--from generative model development
and data heterogeneity handling to privacy-preserving strategies that ensure
both flexibility and security for circuit designers and semiconductor
manufacturers. Extensive experiments across varying client counts and dataset
sizes demonstrate that AnalogFed achieves performance comparable to centralized
baselines--while maintaining strict data privacy. Specifically, the generative
AI model within AnalogFed achieves state-of-the-art efficiency and scalability
in the design of analog circuit topologies.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种分布式的机器学习遗忘框架，通过移除少量关键数据点，有效删除不需要的分布信息，同时保留所需分布。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有遗忘工具主要针对单个样本，无法高效删除整个分布信息，且残余信号可能被下游模型恢复。

Method: 提出基于Kullback-Leibler散度的分布遗忘框架，通过精确计算Pareto前沿，设计距离选择规则减少删除量。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在合成数据及真实数据集上比随机删除减少15-72%的删除量，且对保留性能影响可忽略。

Conclusion: 分布遗忘框架为高效删除不需要的分布信息提供了模型无关的解决方案，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Machine unlearning seeks to remove unwanted information from trained models,
initially at the individual-sample level, but increasingly at the level of
entire sub-populations. In many deployments, models must delete whole topical
domains to satisfy privacy, legal, or quality requirements, e.g., removing
several users' posts under GDPR or copyrighted web content. Existing unlearning
tools remain largely sample-oriented, and straightforward point deletion often
leaves enough residual signal for downstream learners to recover the unwanted
domain. We introduce distributional unlearning, a data-centric, model-agnostic
framework that asks: Given examples from an unwanted distribution and a
retained distribution, what is the smallest set of points whose removal makes
the edited dataset far from the unwanted domain yet close to the retained one?
Using Kullback-Leibler divergence to quantify removal and preservation, we
derive the exact Pareto frontier in the Gaussian case and prove that any model
retrained on the edited data incurs log-loss shifts bounded by the divergence
thresholds. We propose a simple distance-based selection rule satisfying these
constraints with a quadratic reduction in deletion budget compared to random
removal. Experiments on synthetic Gaussians, Jigsaw Toxic Comments, SMS spam,
and CIFAR-10 show 15-72% fewer deletions than random, with negligible impact on
retained performance.

Result: 理论证明跨通道信息降低预测风险，实验显示U-Cast在Time-HD基准上优于基线模型。

Conclusion: U-Cast和Time-HD为未来HDTSF研究奠定基础。

Abstract: Time series forecasting (TSF) is a central problem in time series analysis.
However, as the number of channels in time series datasets scales to the
thousands or more, a scenario we define as High-Dimensional Time Series
Forecasting (HDTSF), it introduces significant new modeling challenges that are
often not the primary focus of traditional TSF research. HDTSF is challenging
because the channel correlation often forms complex and hierarchical patterns.
Existing TSF models either ignore these interactions or fail to scale as
dimensionality grows. To address this issue, we propose U-Cast, a
channel-dependent forecasting architecture that learns latent hierarchical
channel structures with an innovative query-based attention. To disentangle
highly correlated channel representation, U-Cast adds a full-rank
regularization during training. We also release Time-HD, a benchmark of large,
diverse, high-dimensional datasets. Our theory shows that exploiting
cross-channel information lowers forecasting risk, and experiments on Time-HD
demonstrate that U-Cast surpasses strong baselines in both accuracy and
efficiency. Together, U-Cast and Time-HD provide a solid basis for future HDTSF
research.

ability of the architecture both to exploit constraints in training and to
enforce constraints at inference time.

Motivation: 机器学习决策模型的不透明性导致用户难以理解决策原因，现有CFEs评估指标（如接近性）可能忽视用户的实际偏好和约束。

Method: 通过两项用户研究（20名众包工人和41名参与者）验证现有指标与用户偏好的对齐性，并提出AWP模型。

Result: 用户偏好的CFEs与基于接近性的指标仅匹配63.81%，AWP模型预测准确率达84.37%。

Conclusion: 研究强调了用户中心评估指标的重要性，AWP模型为个性化CFE生成提供了首个以人为中心的验证。

Abstract: Machine learning-based decision models are increasingly being used to make
decisions that significantly impact people's lives, but their opaque nature
leaves end users without a clear understanding of why a decision was made.
Counterfactual Explanations (CFEs) have grown in popularity as a means of
offering actionable guidance by identifying the minimum changes in feature
values required to flip a model's prediction to something more desirable.
Unfortunately, most prior research in CFEs relies on artificial evaluation
metrics, such as proximity, which may overlook end-user preferences and
constraints, e.g., the user's perception of effort needed to make certain
feature changes may differ from that of the model designer. To address this
research gap, this paper makes three novel contributions. First, we conduct a
pilot study with 20 crowd-workers on Amazon MTurk to experimentally validate
the alignment of existing CF evaluation metrics with real-world user
preferences. Results show that user-preferred CFEs matched those based on
proximity in only 63.81% of cases, highlighting the limited applicability of
these metrics in real-world settings. Second, inspired by the need to design a
user-informed evaluation metric for CFEs, we conduct a more detailed two-day
user study with 41 participants facing realistic credit application scenarios
to find experimental support for or against three intuitive hypotheses that may
explain how end users evaluate CFEs. Third, based on the findings of this
second study, we propose the AWP model, a novel user-centric, two-stage model
that describes one possible mechanism by which users evaluate and select CFEs.
Our results show that AWP predicts user-preferred CFEs with 84.37% accuracy.
Our study provides the first human-centered validation for personalized cost
models in CFE generation and highlights the need for adaptive, user-centered
evaluation metrics.

Abstract: We study the problem of learning the structure and parameters of the Ising
model, a fundamental model of high-dimensional data, when observing the
evolution of an associated Markov chain. A recent line of work has studied the
natural problem of learning when observing an evolution of the well-known
Glauber dynamics [Bresler, Gamarnik, Shah, IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory 2018,
Gaitonde, Mossel STOC 2024], which provides an arguably more realistic
generative model than the classical i.i.d. setting. However, this prior work
crucially assumes that all site update attempts are observed, \emph{even when
this attempt does not change the configuration}: this strong observation model
is seemingly essential for these approaches. While perhaps possible in
restrictive contexts, this precludes applicability to most realistic settings
where we can observe \emph{only} the stochastic evolution itself, a minimal and
natural assumption for any process we might hope to learn from. However,
designing algorithms that succeed in this more realistic setting has remained
an open problem [Bresler, Gamarnik, Shah, IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory 2018,
Gaitonde, Moitra, Mossel, STOC 2025].
  In this work, we give the first algorithms that efficiently learn the Ising
model in this much more natural observation model that only observes when the
configuration changes. For Ising models with maximum degree $d$, our algorithm
recovers the underlying dependency graph in time $\mathsf{poly}(d)\cdot n^2\log
n$ and then the actual parameters in additional $\widetilde{O}(2^d n)$ time,
which qualitatively matches the state-of-the-art even in the i.i.d. setting in
a much weaker observation model. Our analysis holds more generally for a
broader class of reversible, single-site Markov chains that also includes the
popular Metropolis chain by leveraging more robust properties of reversible
Markov chains.

Abstract: Traffic Signal Control (TSC) is essential for managing urban traffic flow and
reducing congestion. Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers an adaptive method for
TSC by responding to dynamic traffic patterns, with multi-agent RL (MARL)
gaining traction as intersections naturally function as coordinated agents.
However, due to shifts in environmental dynamics, implementing MARL-based TSC
policies in the real world often leads to a significant performance drop, known
as the sim-to-real gap. Grounded Action Transformation (GAT) has successfully
mitigated this gap in single-agent RL for TSC, but real-world traffic networks,
which involve numerous interacting intersections, are better suited to a MARL
framework. In this work, we introduce JL-GAT, an application of GAT to
MARL-based TSC that balances scalability with enhanced grounding capability by
incorporating information from neighboring agents. JL-GAT adopts a
decentralized approach to GAT, allowing for the scalability often required in
real-world traffic networks while still capturing key interactions between
agents. Comprehensive experiments on various road networks under simulated
adverse weather conditions, along with ablation studies, demonstrate the
effectiveness of JL-GAT. The code is publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交网络中节点特征常因隐私或缺乏固有属性而缺失，影响GNN性能。

Method: 提出两种策略：1）使用平均可控性等中心性指标（NCT-EFA）作为节点特征；2）开发排名编码方法将图论指标转化为固定维度特征。

Result: 实验表明，平均可控性显著提升GNN性能，排名编码方法优于传统方法（如ROC AUC从68.7%提升至73.9%）。

Conclusion: 平均可控性和排名编码方法能有效生成高效节点表示，提升GNN在社交网络中的表现。

Abstract: In this article, we utilize the concept of average controllability in graphs,
along with a novel rank encoding method, to enhance the performance of Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs) in social network classification tasks. GNNs have proven
highly effective in various network-based learning applications and require
some form of node features to function. However, their performance is heavily
influenced by the expressiveness of these features. In social networks, node
features are often unavailable due to privacy constraints or the absence of
inherent attributes, making it challenging for GNNs to achieve optimal
performance. To address this limitation, we propose two strategies for
constructing expressive node features. First, we introduce average
controllability along with other centrality metrics (denoted as NCT-EFA) as
node-level metrics that capture critical aspects of network topology. Building
on this, we develop a rank encoding method that transforms average
controllability or any other graph-theoretic metric into a fixed-dimensional
feature space, thereby improving feature representation. We conduct extensive
numerical evaluations using six benchmark GNN models across four social network
datasets to compare different node feature construction methods. Our results
demonstrate that incorporating average controllability into the feature space
significantly improves GNN performance. Moreover, the proposed rank encoding
method outperforms traditional one-hot degree encoding, improving the ROC AUC
from 68.7% to 73.9% using GraphSAGE on the GitHub Stargazers dataset,
underscoring its effectiveness in generating expressive and efficient node
representations.

Conclusion: LSDGNN通过多模态特征提取和优化的课程学习，显著提升了情感识别在对话中的表现。

Abstract: Emotion Recognition in Conversation (ERC) is a practical and challenging
task. This paper proposes a novel multimodal approach, the Long-Short Distance
Graph Neural Network (LSDGNN). Based on the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), it
constructs a long-distance graph neural network and a short-distance graph
neural network to obtain multimodal features of distant and nearby utterances,
respectively. To ensure that long- and short-distance features are as distinct
as possible in representation while enabling mutual influence between the two
modules, we employ a Differential Regularizer and incorporate a BiAffine Module
to facilitate feature interaction. In addition, we propose an Improved
Curriculum Learning (ICL) to address the challenge of data imbalance. By
computing the similarity between different emotions to emphasize the shifts in
similar emotions, we design a "weighted emotional shift" metric and develop a
difficulty measurer, enabling a training process that prioritizes learning easy
samples before harder ones. Experimental results on the IEMOCAP and MELD
datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms existing benchmarks.

Conclusion: 提出的精确重构与优化框架可广泛应用于二元不平衡分类及其他直接度量优化问题。

Abstract: For classification with imbalanced class frequencies, i.e., imbalanced
classification (IC), standard accuracy is known to be misleading as a
performance measure. While most existing methods for IC resort to optimizing
balanced accuracy (i.e., the average of class-wise recalls), they fall short in
scenarios where the significance of classes varies or certain metrics should
reach prescribed levels. In this paper, we study two key classification
metrics, precision and recall, under three practical binary IC settings: fix
precision optimize recall (FPOR), fix recall optimize precision (FROP), and
optimize $F_\beta$-score (OFBS). Unlike existing methods that rely on smooth
approximations to deal with the indicator function involved, \textit{we
introduce, for the first time, exact constrained reformulations for these
direct metric optimization (DMO) problems}, which can be effectively solved by
exact penalty methods. Experiment results on multiple benchmark datasets
demonstrate the practical superiority of our approach over the state-of-the-art
methods for the three DMO problems. We also expect our exact reformulation and
optimization (ERO) framework to be applicable to a wide range of DMO problems
for binary IC and beyond. Our code is available at

Motivation: 食品配送平台的需求预测对运营决策至关重要，但存在空间异质性和时间波动性，传统方法难以应对。

Result: 在真实数据集上验证，模型能高精度预测未来订单量。

Conclusion: 该框架为城市食品配送提供了可扩展、自适应的解决方案，支持车队定位、资源分配和调度优化。

Abstract: Accurate demand forecasting is critical for enhancing the efficiency and
responsiveness of food delivery platforms, where spatial heterogeneity and
temporal fluctuations in order volumes directly influence operational
decisions. This paper proposes an attention-based Graph Neural Network
framework that captures spatial-temporal dependencies by modeling the food
delivery environment as a graph. In this graph, nodes represent urban delivery
zones, while edges reflect spatial proximity and inter-regional order flow
patterns derived from historical data. The attention mechanism dynamically
weighs the influence of neighboring zones, enabling the model to focus on the
most contextually relevant areas during prediction. Temporal trends are jointly
learned alongside spatial interactions, allowing the model to adapt to evolving
demand patterns. Extensive experiments on real-world food delivery datasets
demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model in forecasting future order
volumes with high accuracy. The framework offers a scalable and adaptive
solution to support proactive fleet positioning, resource allocation, and
dispatch optimization in urban food delivery operations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型的高保真生成能力受限于计算成本高的推理过程，现有加速方法需重新训练或牺牲质量。

Method: 将多核扩散采样视为ODE求解器管道，通过理论支持的核间通信机制，快速求解器逐步修正慢速求解器。

Result: CHORDS在多样大规模图像和视频扩散模型中显著加速采样，4核提速2.1倍，8核提速2.9倍，无质量损失。

Conclusion: CHORDS为实时高保真扩散生成奠定了坚实基础。

Abstract: Diffusion-based generative models have become dominant generators of
high-fidelity images and videos but remain limited by their computationally
expensive inference procedures. Existing acceleration techniques either require
extensive model retraining or compromise significantly on sample quality. This
paper explores a general, training-free, and model-agnostic acceleration
strategy via multi-core parallelism. Our framework views multi-core diffusion
sampling as an ODE solver pipeline, where slower yet accurate solvers
progressively rectify faster solvers through a theoretically justified
inter-core communication mechanism. This motivates our multi-core training-free
diffusion sampling accelerator, CHORDS, which is compatible with various
diffusion samplers, model architectures, and modalities. Through extensive
experiments, CHORDS significantly accelerates sampling across diverse
large-scale image and video diffusion models, yielding up to 2.1x speedup with
four cores, improving by 50% over baselines, and 2.9x speedup with eight cores,
all without quality degradation. This advancement enables CHORDS to establish a
solid foundation for real-time, high-fidelity diffusion generation.

Motivation: 研究旨在探索人工智能技术是否能个性化闭环神经刺激疗法，并解决现有方法在样本效率、训练时间和延迟等方面的挑战。

Method: 采用时间基函数模型（TBFMs），通过单次试验预测光遗传刺激对局部场电位（LFPs）的影响，并模拟闭环刺激控制神经活动。

Result: TBF模型在样本效率（15-20分钟数据收集）、训练时间（2-4分钟）和延迟（0.2毫秒）方面表现优异，预测精度与基线非线性动力学模型相当，优于线性状态空间模型。

Conclusion: TBF模型为复杂AI方法与临床可用的闭环刺激协议之间搭建了桥梁，展示了其在开发新型神经刺激疗法中的潜力。

Abstract: Closed-loop neural stimulation provides novel therapies for neurological
diseases such as Parkinson's disease (PD), but it is not yet clear whether
artificial intelligence (AI) techniques can tailor closed-loop stimulation to
individual patients or identify new therapies. Progress requires us to address
a number of translational issues, including sample efficiency, training time,
and minimizing loop latency such that stimulation may be shaped in response to
changing brain activity. We propose temporal basis function models (TBFMs) to
address these difficulties, and explore this approach in the context of
excitatory optogenetic stimulation. We demonstrate the ability of TBF models to
provide a single-trial, spatiotemporal forward prediction of the effect of
optogenetic stimulation on local field potentials (LFPs) measured in two
non-human primates. We further use simulations to demonstrate the use of TBF
models for closed-loop stimulation, driving neural activity towards target
patterns. The simplicity of TBF models allow them to be sample efficient, rapid
to train (2-4min), and low latency (0.2ms) on desktop CPUs. We demonstrate the
model on 40 sessions of previously published excitatory optogenetic stimulation
data. For each session, the model required 15-20min of data collection to
successfully model the remainder of the session. It achieved a prediction
accuracy comparable to a baseline nonlinear dynamical systems model that
requires hours to train, and superior accuracy to a linear state-space model.
In our simulations, it also successfully allowed a closed-loop stimulator to
control a neural circuit. Our approach begins to bridge the translational gap
between complex AI-based approaches to modeling dynamical systems and the
vision of using such forward prediction models to develop novel, clinically
useful closed-loop stimulation protocols.

Conclusion: 提出的流式遗忘算法在理论和实验上均表现出色，适用于实际场景。

Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to remove knowledge of the specific training data in
a well-trained model. Currently, machine unlearning methods typically handle
all forgetting data in a single batch, removing the corresponding knowledge all
at once upon request. However, in practical scenarios, requests for data
removal often arise in a streaming manner rather than in a single batch,
leading to reduced efficiency and effectiveness in existing methods. Such
challenges of streaming forgetting have not been the focus of much research. In
this paper, to address the challenges of performance maintenance, efficiency,
and data access brought about by streaming unlearning requests, we introduce a
streaming unlearning paradigm, formalizing the unlearning as a distribution
shift problem. We then estimate the altered distribution and propose a novel
streaming unlearning algorithm to achieve efficient streaming forgetting
without requiring access to the original training data. Theoretical analyses
confirm an $O(\sqrt{T} + V_T)$ error bound on the streaming unlearning regret,
where $V_T$ represents the cumulative total variation in the optimal solution
over $T$ learning rounds. This theoretical guarantee is achieved under mild
conditions without the strong restriction of convex loss function. Experiments
across various models and datasets validate the performance of our proposed
method.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在稀疏和密集奖励环境中均表现优异，支持不完整演示下的稳健探索。

Conclusion: 为现实环境中缺乏最优数据和精确奖励控制的强化学习提供了实用框架。

Abstract: Recent trends in Reinforcement Learning (RL) highlight the need for agents to
learn from reward-free interactions and alternative supervision signals, such
as unlabeled or incomplete demonstrations, rather than relying solely on
explicit reward maximization. Additionally, developing generalist agents that
can adapt efficiently in real-world environments often requires leveraging
these reward-free signals to guide learning and behavior. However, while
intrinsic motivation techniques provide a means for agents to seek out novel or
uncertain states in the absence of explicit rewards, they are often challenged
by dense reward environments or the complexity of high-dimensional state and
action spaces. Furthermore, most existing approaches rely directly on the
unprocessed intrinsic reward signals, which can make it difficult to shape or
control the agent's exploration effectively. We propose a framework that can
effectively utilize expert demonstrations, even when they are incomplete and
imperfect. By applying a mapping function to transform the similarity between
an agent's state and expert data into a shaped intrinsic reward, our method
allows for flexible and targeted exploration of expert-like behaviors. We
employ a Mixture of Autoencoder Experts to capture a diverse range of behaviors
and accommodate missing information in demonstrations. Experiments show our
approach enables robust exploration and strong performance in both sparse and
dense reward environments, even when demonstrations are sparse or incomplete.
This provides a practical framework for RL in realistic settings where optimal
data is unavailable and precise reward control is needed.

Result: 在模拟数据中验证了方法的有效性，能恢复真实模型参数并达到理想预测性能。

Conclusion: 为多变量时间序列的动态交互分析提供了更强大的工具。

Abstract: System identification methods for multivariate time-series, such as neural
and behavioral recordings, have been used to build models for predicting one
from the other. For example, Preferential Subspace Identification (PSID) builds
a state-space model of a primary time-series (e.g., neural activity) to
optimally predict a secondary time-series (e.g., behavior). However, PSID
focuses on optimal prediction using past primary data, even though in offline
applications, better estimation can be achieved by incorporating concurrent
data (filtering) or all available data (smoothing). Here, we extend PSID to
enable optimal filtering and smoothing. First, we show that the presence of a
secondary signal makes it possible to uniquely identify a model with an optimal
Kalman update step (to enable filtering) from a family of otherwise equivalent
state-space models. Our filtering solution augments PSID with a reduced-rank
regression step that directly learns the optimal gain required for the update
step from data. We refer to this extension of PSID as PSID with filtering.
Second, inspired by two-filter Kalman smoother formulations, we develop a novel
forward-backward PSID smoothing algorithm where we first apply PSID with
filtering and then apply it again in the reverse time direction on the
residuals of the filtered secondary signal. We validate our methods on
simulated data, showing that our approach recovers the ground-truth model
parameters for filtering, and achieves optimal filtering and smoothing decoding
performance of the secondary signal that matches the ideal performance of the
true underlying model. This work provides a principled framework for optimal
linear filtering and smoothing in the two-signal setting, significantly
expanding the toolkit for analyzing dynamic interactions in multivariate
time-series.

Motivation: Thompson Sampling (TS)在高维问题中探索不足，FG-TS通过乐观奖励解决了这一问题，但其在近似后验下的性能尚未被系统评估。

Method: 在11个基准测试中比较FG-TS和SFG-TS的性能，包括精确后验（线性和逻辑bandits）和近似后验（使用快速但粗糙的随机梯度采样器）。

Result: FG-TS在线性和逻辑bandits中优于普通TS，但在神经bandits中表现较弱。较大的奖励在精确后验下有益，但在采样噪声主导时有害。

Conclusion: FG-TS及其变体易于使用且具有竞争力，建议作为现代上下文bandit基准测试的基线。所有实验代码已开源。

Abstract: Thompson Sampling (TS) is widely used to address the exploration/exploitation
tradeoff in contextual bandits, yet recent theory shows that it does not
explore aggressively enough in high-dimensional problems. Feel-Good Thompson
Sampling (FG-TS) addresses this by adding an optimism bonus that biases toward
high-reward models, and it achieves the asymptotically minimax-optimal regret
in the linear setting when posteriors are exact. However, its performance with
\emph{approximate} posteriors -- common in large-scale or neural problems --
has not been benchmarked. We provide the first systematic study of FG-TS and
its smoothed variant (SFG-TS) across eleven real-world and synthetic
benchmarks. To evaluate their robustness, we compare performance across
settings with exact posteriors (linear and logistic bandits) to approximate
regimes produced by fast but coarse stochastic-gradient samplers. Ablations
over preconditioning, bonus scale, and prior strength reveal a trade-off:
larger bonuses help when posterior samples are accurate, but hurt when sampling
noise dominates. FG-TS generally outperforms vanilla TS in linear and logistic
bandits, but tends to be weaker in neural bandits. Nevertheless, because FG-TS
and its variants are competitive and easy-to-use, we recommend them as
baselines in modern contextual-bandit benchmarks. Finally, we provide source
code for all our experiments in

Result: MGT在晶体性质预测任务中平均绝对误差降低21%，迁移学习场景中性能提升高达58%。

Conclusion: MGT可作为晶体材料性质预测的有用模型，为新材料发现提供工具。

Abstract: Accurately and comprehensively representing crystal structures is critical
for advancing machine learning in large-scale crystal materials simulations,
however, effectively capturing and leveraging the intricate geometric and
topological characteristics of crystal structures remains a core, long-standing
challenge for most existing methods in crystal property prediction. Here, we
propose MGT, a multi-view graph transformer framework that synergistically
fuses SE3 invariant and SO3 equivariant graph representations, which
respectively captures rotation-translation invariance and rotation equivariance
in crystal geometries. To strategically incorporate these complementary
geometric representations, we employ a lightweight mixture of experts router in
MGT to adaptively adjust the weight assigned to SE3 and SO3 embeddings based on
the specific target task. Compared with previous state-of-the-art models, MGT
reduces the mean absolute error by up to 21% on crystal property prediction
tasks through multi-task self-supervised pretraining. Ablation experiments and
interpretable investigations confirm the effectiveness of each technique
implemented in our framework. Additionally, in transfer learning scenarios
including crystal catalyst adsorption energy and hybrid perovskite bandgap
prediction, MGT achieves performance improvements of up to 58% over existing
baselines, demonstrating domain-agnostic scalability across diverse application
domains. As evidenced by the above series of studies, we believe that MGT can
serve as useful model for crystal material property prediction, providing a
valuable tool for the discovery of novel materials.

Result: 在33个数据-任务对中，M-DESIGN在有限预算内为26对提供了最优模型。

Conclusion: M-DESIGN通过动态知识库和关系分析，显著提升了模型优化的效率和效果。

Abstract: Database systems have recently advocated for embedding machine learning (ML)
capabilities, offering declarative model queries over large, managed model
repositories, thereby circumventing the huge computational overhead of
traditional ML-based algorithms in automated neural network model selection.
Pioneering database studies aim to organize existing benchmark repositories as
model bases (MB), querying them for the model records with the highest
performance estimation metrics for given tasks. However, this static model
selection practice overlooks the fine-grained, evolving relational dependencies
between diverse task queries and model architecture variations, resulting in
suboptimal matches and failing to further refine the model effectively. To fill
the model refinement gap in database research, we propose M-DESIGN, a curated
model knowledge base (MKB) pipeline for mastering neural network refinement by
adaptively weaving prior insights about model architecture modification. First,
we propose a knowledge weaving engine that reframes model refinement as an
adaptive query problem over task metadata. Given a user's task query, M-DESIGN
quickly matches and iteratively refines candidate models by leveraging a
graph-relational knowledge schema that explicitly encodes data properties,
architecture variations, and pairwise performance deltas as joinable relations.
This schema supports fine-grained relational analytics over architecture tweaks
and drives a predictive query planner that can detect and adapt to
out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks. We instantiate M-DESIGN for graph analytics
tasks, where our model knowledge base enriches existing benchmarks with
structured metadata covering 3 graph tasks and 22 graph datasets, contributing
data records of 67,760 graph models. Empirical results demonstrate that
M-DESIGN delivers the optimal model in 26 of 33 data-task pairs within limited
budgets.

Result: 实验显示FLock能抵御后门攻击，攻击成功率降低68%，且模型在多领域泛化能力优于孤立训练模型。

Conclusion: FLock为大规模LLM在去中心化环境中的安全微调提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Fine-tuning the large language models (LLMs) are prevented by the deficiency
of centralized control and the massive computing and communication overhead on
the decentralized schemes. While the typical standard federated learning (FL)
supports data privacy, the central server requirement creates a single point of
attack and vulnerability to poisoning attacks. Generalizing the result in this
direction to 70B-parameter models in the heterogeneous, trustless environments
has turned out to be a huge, yet unbroken bottleneck. This paper introduces
FLock, a decentralized framework for secure and efficient collaborative LLM
fine-tuning. Integrating a blockchain-based trust layer with economic
incentives, FLock replaces the central aggregator with a secure, auditable
protocol for cooperation among untrusted parties. We present the first
empirical validation of fine-tuning a 70B LLM in a secure, multi-domain,
decentralized setting. Our experiments show the FLock framework defends against
backdoor poisoning attacks that compromise standard FL optimizers and fosters
synergistic knowledge transfer. The resulting models show a >68% reduction in
adversarial attack success rates. The global model also demonstrates superior
cross-domain generalization, outperforming models trained in isolation on their
own specialized data.

*Julia Machnio,Mads Nielsen,Mostafa Mehdipour Ghazi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PALM是一种统一的数学模型，用于分析主动学习（AL）的动态过程，通过四个关键参数预测和比较不同AL策略的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统AL评估方法仅关注最终准确性，无法全面捕捉学习过程的动态性，PALM旨在填补这一空白。

Method: PALM通过四个参数（可达到的准确性、覆盖效率、早期表现和可扩展性）描述AL轨迹，并利用部分观测预测未来性能。

Result: 在多个数据集和AL策略上的实验表明，PALM能有效预测学习曲线，揭示学习效率和数据覆盖的关键见解。

Conclusion: PALM为AL的系统化评估提供了基础，支持在资源受限场景下选择高效策略。

Abstract: Active learning (AL) seeks to reduce annotation costs by selecting the most
informative samples for labeling, making it particularly valuable in
resource-constrained settings. However, traditional evaluation methods, which
focus solely on final accuracy, fail to capture the full dynamics of the
learning process. To address this gap, we propose PALM (Performance Analysis of
Active Learning Models), a unified and interpretable mathematical model that
characterizes AL trajectories through four key parameters: achievable accuracy,
coverage efficiency, early-stage performance, and scalability. PALM provides a
predictive description of AL behavior from partial observations, enabling the
estimation of future performance and facilitating principled comparisons across
different strategies. We validate PALM through extensive experiments on
CIFAR-10/100 and ImageNet-50/100/200, covering a wide range of AL methods and
self-supervised embeddings. Our results demonstrate that PALM generalizes
effectively across datasets, budgets, and strategies, accurately predicting
full learning curves from limited labeled data. Importantly, PALM reveals
crucial insights into learning efficiency, data space coverage, and the
scalability of AL methods. By enabling the selection of cost-effective
strategies and predicting performance under tight budget constraints, PALM lays
the basis for more systematic, reproducible, and data-efficient evaluation of
AL in both research and real-world applications. The code is available at:

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为CSG的新型网格化框架，通过联合优化信道估计和网格化，仅使用RSRP数据实现高效分区。CSG-AE模型结合了编码器、量化器和物理解码器，并通过PIDA训练方案提升性能。实验表明，CSG在合成和真实数据上均优于现有方法。

Abstract: Gridization, the process of partitioning space into grids where users share
similar channel characteristics, serves as a fundamental prerequisite for
efficient large-scale network optimization. However, existing methods like
Geographical or Beam Space Gridization (GSG or BSG) are limited by reliance on
unavailable location data or the flawed assumption that similar signal
strengths imply similar channel properties. We propose Channel Space
Gridization (CSG), a pioneering framework that unifies channel estimation and
gridization for the first time. Formulated as a joint optimization problem, CSG
uses only beam-level reference signal received power (RSRP) to estimate Channel
Angle Power Spectra (CAPS) and partition samples into grids with homogeneous
channel characteristics. To perform CSG, we develop the CSG Autoencoder
(CSG-AE), featuring a trainable RSRP-to-CAPS encoder, a learnable sparse
codebook quantizer, and a physics-informed decoder based on the Localized
Statistical Channel Model. On recognizing the limitations of naive training
scheme, we propose a novel Pretraining-Initialization-Detached-Asynchronous
(PIDA) training scheme for CSG-AE, ensuring stable and effective training by
systematically addressing the common pitfalls of the naive training paradigm.
Evaluations reveal that CSG-AE excels in CAPS estimation accuracy and
clustering quality on synthetic data. On real-world datasets, it reduces Active
Mean Absolute Error (MAE) by 30\% and Overall MAE by 65\% on RSRP prediction
accuracy compared to salient baselines using the same data, while improving
channel consistency, cluster sizes balance, and active ratio, advancing the
development of gridization for large-scale network optimization.

Motivation: 现有方法缺乏理论支持，实践中常用预训练去噪器替代近端算子，但无一般性理论证明。

Result: 算法在理论支持下收敛到近端算子，为现有启发式方法提供了合理性。

Conclusion: 研究为实践中成功的启发式方法提供了理论依据，填补了理论与实践的鸿沟。

Abstract: Denoiser models have become powerful tools for inverse problems, enabling the
use of pretrained networks to approximate the score of a smoothed prior
distribution. These models are often used in heuristic iterative schemes aimed
at solving Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) optimisation problems, where the proximal
operator of the negative log-prior plays a central role. In practice, this
operator is intractable, and practitioners plug in a pretrained denoiser as a
surrogate-despite the lack of general theoretical justification for this
substitution. In this work, we show that a simple algorithm, closely related to
several used in practice, provably converges to the proximal operator under a
log-concavity assumption on the prior $p$. We show that this algorithm can be
interpreted as a gradient descent on smoothed proximal objectives. Our analysis
thus provides a theoretical foundation for a class of empirically successful
but previously heuristic methods.

Conclusion: 论文为Transformer在流形变分问题中的研究奠定了基础，展示了其数学理论基础和潜在应用价值。

Abstract: We offer a theoretical mathematical background to Transformers through
Lagrangian optimization across the token space. The Transformer, as a flow map,
exists in the tangent fiber for each token along the high-dimensional unit
sphere. The circumstance of the hypersphere across the latent data is
reasonable due to the trained diagonal matrix equal to the identity, which has
various empirical justifications. Thus, under the continuum limit of the
dynamics, the latent vectors flow among the tangent bundle. Using these facts,
we devise a mathematical framework for the Transformer through calculus of
variations. We develop a functional and show that the continuous flow map
induced by the Transformer satisfies this functional, therefore the Transformer
can be viewed as a natural solver of a calculus of variations problem. We
invent new scenarios of when our methods are applicable based on loss
optimization with respect to path optimality. We derive the Euler-Lagrange
equation for the Transformer. The variant of the Euler-Lagrange equation we
present has various appearances in literature, but, to our understanding,
oftentimes not foundationally proven or under other specialized cases. Our
overarching proof is new: our techniques are classical and the use of the flow
map object is original. We provide several other relevant results, primarily
ones specific to neural scenarios. In particular, much of our analysis will be
attempting to quantify Transformer data in variational contexts under neural
approximations. Calculus of variations on manifolds is a well-nourished
research area, but for the Transformer specifically, it is uncharted: we lay
the foundation for this area through an introduction to the Lagrangian for the
Transformer.

Result: 在多项基准测试中，ARFF方法在损失最小化和收敛速度上均优于或等同于传统Adam优化。

Conclusion: ARFF方法为随机动力学的数据驱动建模提供了一种有潜力的替代方案。

Abstract: This work proposes a training algorithm based on adaptive random Fourier
features (ARFF) with Metropolis sampling and resampling
\cite{kammonen2024adaptiverandomfourierfeatures} for learning drift and
diffusion components of stochastic differential equations from snapshot data.
Specifically, this study considers It\^{o} diffusion processes and a
likelihood-based loss function derived from the Euler-Maruyama integration
introduced in \cite{Dietrich2023} and
\cite{dridi2021learningstochasticdynamicalsystems}.
  This work evaluates the proposed method against benchmark problems presented
in \cite{Dietrich2023}, including polynomial examples, underdamped Langevin
dynamics, a stochastic susceptible-infected-recovered model, and a stochastic
wave equation. Across all cases, the ARFF-based approach matches or surpasses
the performance of conventional Adam-based optimization in both loss
minimization and convergence speed. These results highlight the potential of
ARFF as a compelling alternative for data-driven modeling of stochastic
dynamics.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决车内情感识别中的模态脆弱性、生理差异性和隐私风险问题。

Result: 联邦CNN准确率77%，随机森林74%，融合后87%，与集中式基线相当，同时保护数据隐私。

Conclusion: FedMultiEmo为车内实时、隐私保护的情感识别提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: In-vehicle emotion recognition underpins adaptive driver-assistance systems
and, ultimately, occupant safety. However, practical deployment is hindered by
(i) modality fragility - poor lighting and occlusions degrade vision-based
methods; (ii) physiological variability - heart-rate and skin-conductance
patterns differ across individuals; and (iii) privacy risk - centralized
training requires transmission of sensitive data. To address these challenges,
we present FedMultiEmo, a privacy-preserving framework that fuses two
complementary modalities at the decision level: visual features extracted by a
Convolutional Neural Network from facial images, and physiological cues (heart
rate, electrodermal activity, and skin temperature) classified by a Random
Forest. FedMultiEmo builds on three key elements: (1) a multimodal federated
learning pipeline with majority-vote fusion, (2) an end-to-end edge-to-cloud
prototype on Raspberry Pi clients and a Flower server, and (3) a personalized
Federated Averaging scheme that weights client updates by local data volume.
Evaluated on FER2013 and a custom physiological dataset, the federated
Convolutional Neural Network attains 77% accuracy, the Random Forest 74%, and
their fusion 87%, matching a centralized baseline while keeping all raw data
local. The developed system converges in 18 rounds, with an average round time
of 120 seconds and a per-client memory footprint below 200 MB. These results
indicate that FedMultiEmo offers a practical approach to real-time,
privacy-aware emotion recognition in automotive settings.

<details>

Motivation: 在RLHF训练中，语言模型的响应逐渐偏离奖励模型的训练分布，导致奖励模型不准确，进而影响策略优化。

Result: 实验证明OCRM在摘要和聊天机器人任务中表现优于标准RLHF方法。

Conclusion: OCRM有效解决了RLHF中的过优化问题，提升了策略性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) allows us to train models,
such as language models (LMs), to follow complex human preferences. In RLHF for
LMs, we first train an LM using supervised fine-tuning, sample pairs of
responses, obtain human feedback, and use the resulting data to train a reward
model (RM). RL methods are then used to train the LM to maximize the reward
given by the RM. As training progresses, the responses generated by the LM no
longer resemble the responses seen by the RM during training, leading to the RM
becoming inaccurate. The score given by the RM keeps increasing, but the
learned behavior no longer matches the human preferences. This issue is known
as overoptimization. We investigate overoptimization from the point of view of
distribution shift and show that the shift results in an inconsistent estimate
of the RM parameters, leading to an inconsistent estimate of the policy
gradient. We propose Off-Policy Corrected Reward Modeling (OCRM), which
iteratively off-policy corrects the RM using importance weighting, without
requiring new labels or samples. This results in a more accurate RM, which
empirically leads to an improved final policy. We validate our approach in
experiments with summarization and chatbot datasets and show that it performs
significantly better than standard RLHF methods and baselines. Our
implementation is available at

Motivation: 域偏移是深度学习中的常见问题，导致预训练模型在测试数据上性能下降。本研究旨在利用TTA技术解决音频分类中的域偏移问题。

Method: 采用三种TTA方法（TTT、TENT和CoNMix），并在AudioMNIST和SpeechCommands V1数据集上测试其性能。

Result: 改进版的CoNMix在噪声背景下表现最佳（如10 dB运动自行车噪声下错误率为5.31%）。

Conclusion: 本研究首次将TTA技术应用于音频分类中的域偏移问题，改进版CoNMix表现最优。

Abstract: Domain shift is a prominent problem in Deep Learning, causing a model
pre-trained on a source dataset to suffer significant performance degradation
on test datasets. This research aims to address the issue of audio
classification under domain shift caused by background noise using Test-Time
Adaptation (TTA), a technique that adapts a pre-trained model during testing
using only unlabelled test data before making predictions. We adopt two common
TTA methods, TTT and TENT, and a state-of-the-art method CoNMix, and
investigate their respective performance on two popular audio classification
datasets, AudioMNIST (AM) and SpeechCommands V1 (SC), against different types
of background noise and noise severity levels. The experimental results reveal
that our proposed modified version of CoNMix produced the highest
classification accuracy under domain shift (5.31% error rate under 10 dB
exercise bike background noise and 12.75% error rate under 3 dB running tap
background noise for AM) compared to TTT and TENT. The literature search
provided no evidence of similar works, thereby motivating the work reported
here as the first study to leverage TTA techniques for audio classification
under domain shift.

Motivation: 探讨放射组学在胶质母细胞瘤预后中的实际价值，尤其是与传统临床和分子预测因子的对比。

Method: 使用多中心数据集（1152例患者），开发并评估CR和DL模型，比较不同特征集（影像、临床/分子、组合）和患者子集的性能。

Result: 组合特征CR模型在外部验证中表现最佳（AUC 0.75），但优势有限；DL模型趋势类似但无统计学意义。影像数据在总体生存预测中更具相关性。

Conclusion: 标准CR和DL放射组学方法在胶质母细胞瘤预后中的附加价值有限，临床预测因子（如年龄、性别）仍为主要影响因素。

Abstract: Background: Radiomics shows promise in characterizing glioblastoma, but its
added value over clinical and molecular predictors has yet to be proven. This
study assessed the added value of conventional radiomics (CR) and deep learning
(DL) MRI radiomics for glioblastoma prognosis (<= 6 vs > 6 months survival) on
a large multi-center dataset.
  Methods: After patient selection, our curated dataset gathers 1152
glioblastoma (WHO 2016) patients from five Swiss centers and one public source.
It included clinical (age, gender), molecular (MGMT, IDH), and baseline MRI
data (T1, T1 contrast, FLAIR, T2) with tumor regions. CR and DL models were
developed using standard methods and evaluated on internal and external
cohorts. Sub-analyses assessed models with different feature sets
(imaging-only, clinical/molecular-only, combined-features) and patient subsets
(S-1: all patients, S-2: with molecular data, S-3: IDH wildtype).
  Results: The best performance was observed in the full cohort (S-1). In
external validation, the combined-feature CR model achieved an AUC of 0.75,
slightly, but significantly outperforming clinical-only (0.74) and imaging-only
(0.68) models. DL models showed similar trends, though without statistical
significance. In S-2 and S-3, combined models did not outperform clinical-only
models. Exploratory analysis of CR models for overall survival prediction
suggested greater relevance of imaging data: across all subsets,
combined-feature models significantly outperformed clinical-only models, though
with a modest advantage of 2-4 C-index points.
  Conclusions: While confirming the predictive value of anatomical MRI
sequences for glioblastoma prognosis, this multi-center study found standard CR
and DL radiomics approaches offer minimal added value over demographic
predictors such as age and gender.

Abstract: Evaluating the scientific discovery capabilities of large language model

suite and simulation platform for rigorously assessing LLM-based scientific
reasoning in interactive physics environments. PhysGym's primary contribution
lies in its sophisticated control over the level of prior knowledge provided to
the agent. This allows researchers to dissect agent performance along axes
including the complexity of the problem and the prior knowledge levels. The
benchmark comprises a suite of interactive simulations, where agents must
actively probe environments, gather data sequentially under constraints and
formulate hypotheses about underlying physical laws. PhysGym provides
standardized evaluation protocols and metrics for assessing hypothesis accuracy
and model fidelity. We demonstrate the benchmark's utility by presenting
results from baseline LLMs, showcasing its ability to differentiate
capabilities based on varying priors and task complexity.

<details>

Motivation: 下游资源（如床位）的可用性对计划患者入院至关重要，但实际LOS与预测值可能存在较大差异，导致调度不可行。

Method: 利用机器学习模型预测LOS，并通过模拟评估不同纠正策略下预测准确性与调度灵活性的关系。

Result: 研究发现，更准确的LOS预测可以减少调度调整的影响，但高精度模型的训练成本较高。

Conclusion: 优化资源利用和防止床位溢出的最佳策略需要平衡预测准确性和调度灵活性。

Abstract: The availability of downstream resources plays a critical role in planning
the admission of patients undergoing elective surgery, with inpatient beds
being one of the most crucial resources. When planning patient admissions,
predictions on their length-of-stay (LOS) made by machine learning (ML) models
are used to ensure bed availability. However, the actual LOS for each patient
may differ considerably from the predicted value, potentially making the
schedule infeasible. To address such infeasibilities, rescheduling strategies
that take advantage of operational flexibility can be implemented. For example,
adjustments may include postponing admission dates, relocating patients to
different wards, or even transferring patients who are already admitted. The
common assumption is that more accurate LOS predictions reduce the impact of
rescheduling. However, training ML models that can make such accurate
predictions can be costly. Building on previous work that proposed simulated
\ac{ml} for evaluating data-driven approaches, this paper explores the
relationship between LOS prediction accuracy and rescheduling flexibility
across various corrective policies. Specifically, we examine the most effective
patient rescheduling strategies under LOS prediction errors to prevent bed
overflows while optimizing resource utilization.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of satellite constellations in near-Earth orbits presents
significant challenges in satellite network management, requiring innovative
approaches for efficient, scalable, and resilient operations. This paper
explores the role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in optimizing the operation
of satellite mega-constellations, drawing from the ConstellAI project funded by
the European Space Agency (ESA). A consortium comprising GMV GmbH, Saarland
University, and Thales Alenia Space collaborates to develop AI-driven
algorithms and demonstrates their effectiveness over traditional methods for
two crucial operational challenges: data routing and resource allocation. In
the routing use case, Reinforcement Learning (RL) is used to improve the
end-to-end latency by learning from historical queuing latency, outperforming
classical shortest path algorithms. For resource allocation, RL optimizes the
scheduling of tasks across constellations, focussing on efficiently using
limited resources such as battery and memory. Both use cases were tested for
multiple satellite constellation configurations and operational scenarios,
resembling the real-life spacecraft operations of communications and Earth
observation satellites. This research demonstrates that RL not only competes
with classical approaches but also offers enhanced flexibility, scalability,
and generalizability in decision-making processes, which is crucial for the
autonomous and intelligent management of satellite fleets. The findings of this
activity suggest that AI can fundamentally alter the landscape of satellite
constellation management by providing more adaptive, robust, and cost-effective
solutions.

this position paper, we argue that this stagnation is due to limitations in how
we evaluate anomaly detection algorithms. Current benchmarking does not, for
example, sufficiently reflect the diversity of anomalies in applications
ranging from predictive maintenance to scientific discovery. Consequently, we
need to rethink benchmarking in anomaly detection. In our opinion, anomaly
detection should be studied using scenarios that capture the relevant
characteristics of different applications. We identify three key areas for
improvement: First, we need to identify anomaly detection scenarios based on a
common taxonomy. Second, anomaly detection pipelines should be analyzed
end-to-end and by component. Third, evaluating anomaly detection algorithms
should be meaningful regarding the scenario's objectives.

Abstract: Current research on decision-making in safety-critical scenarios often relies
on inefficient data-driven scenario generation or specific modeling approaches,
which fail to capture corner cases in real-world contexts. To address this
issue, we propose a Red-Team Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning framework,
where background vehicles with interference capabilities are treated as
red-team agents. Through active interference and exploration, red-team vehicles
can uncover corner cases outside the data distribution. The framework uses a
Constraint Graph Representation Markov Decision Process, ensuring that red-team
vehicles comply with safety rules while continuously disrupting the autonomous
vehicles (AVs). A policy threat zone model is constructed to quantify the
threat posed by red-team vehicles to AVs, inducing more extreme actions to
increase the danger level of the scenario. Experimental results show that the
proposed framework significantly impacts AVs decision-making safety and
generates various corner cases. This method also offers a novel direction for
research in safety-critical scenarios.

Conclusion: 提出的策略有效解决了联邦学习中的延迟和设备异构性问题。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a popular approach for collaborative
machine learning in sixth-generation (6G) networks, primarily due to its
privacy-preserving capabilities. The deployment of FL algorithms is expected to
empower a wide range of Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications, e.g., autonomous
driving, augmented reality, and healthcare. The mission-critical and
time-sensitive nature of these applications necessitates the design of
low-latency FL frameworks that guarantee high learning performance. In
practice, achieving low-latency FL faces two challenges: the overhead of
computing and transmitting high-dimensional model updates, and the
heterogeneity in communication-and-computation (C$^2$) capabilities across
devices. To address these challenges, we propose a novel C$^2$-aware framework
for optimal batch-size control that minimizes end-to-end (E2E) learning latency
while ensuring convergence. The framework is designed to balance a fundamental
C$^2$ tradeoff as revealed through convergence analysis. Specifically,
increasing batch sizes improves the accuracy of gradient estimation in FL and
thus reduces the number of communication rounds required for convergence, but
results in higher per-round latency, and vice versa. The associated problem of
latency minimization is intractable; however, we solve it by designing an
accurate and tractable surrogate for convergence speed, with parameters fitted
to real data. This approach yields two batch-size control strategies tailored
to scenarios with slow and fast fading, while also accommodating device
heterogeneity. Extensive experiments using real datasets demonstrate that the
proposed strategies outperform conventional batch-size adaptation schemes that
do not consider the C$^2$ tradeoff or device heterogeneity.

Abstract: Physics-based solvers like HEC-RAS provide high-fidelity river forecasts but
are too computationally intensive for on-the-fly decision-making during flood
events. The central challenge is to accelerate these simulations without
sacrificing accuracy. This paper introduces a deep learning surrogate that
treats HEC-RAS not as a solver but as a data-generation engine. We propose a
hybrid, auto-regressive architecture that combines a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)
to capture short-term temporal dynamics with a Geometry-Aware Fourier Neural
Operator (Geo-FNO) to model long-range spatial dependencies along a river
reach. The model learns underlying physics implicitly from a minimal
eight-channel feature vector encoding dynamic state, static geometry, and
boundary forcings extracted directly from native HEC-RAS files. Trained on 67
reaches of the Mississippi River Basin, the surrogate was evaluated on a
year-long, unseen hold-out simulation. Results show the model achieves a strong
predictive accuracy, with a median absolute stage error of 0.31 feet.
Critically, for a full 67-reach ensemble forecast, our surrogate reduces the
required wall-clock time from 139 minutes to 40 minutes, a speedup of nearly
3.5 times over the traditional solver. The success of this data-driven approach
demonstrates that robust feature engineering can produce a viable, high-speed
replacement for conventional hydraulic models, improving the computational
feasibility of large-scale ensemble flood forecasting.

Abstract: Continual pre-training on small-scale task-specific data is an effective
method for improving large language models in new target fields, yet it risks
catastrophic forgetting of their original capabilities. A common solution is to
re-weight training data mixtures from source and target fields on a domain
space to achieve balanced performance. Previous domain reweighting strategies
rely on manual designation with certain heuristics based on human intuition or
empirical results. In this work, we prove that more general heuristics can be
parameterized by proposing Data Mixing Agent, the first model-based, end-to-end
framework that learns to re-weight domains. The agent learns generalizable
heuristics through reinforcement learning on large quantities of data mixing
trajectories with corresponding feedback from an evaluation environment.
Experiments in continual pre-training on math reasoning show that Data Mixing
Agent outperforms strong baselines in achieving balanced performance across
source and target field benchmarks. Furthermore, it generalizes well across
unseen source fields, target models, and domain spaces without retraining.
Direct application to the code generation field also indicates its adaptability
across target domains. Further analysis showcases the agents' well-aligned
heuristics with human intuitions and their efficiency in achieving superior
model performance with less source-field data.

Abstract: The fundamental laws of physics are intrinsically geometric, dictating the
evolution of systems through principles of symmetry and conservation. While
modern machine learning offers powerful tools for modeling complex dynamics
from data, common methods often ignore this underlying geometric fabric.
Physics-informed neural networks, for instance, can violate fundamental
physical principles, leading to predictions that are unstable over long
periods, particularly for high-dimensional and chaotic systems. Here, we
introduce \textit{Geometric Hamiltonian Neural Networks (GeoHNN)}, a framework
that learns dynamics by explicitly encoding the geometric priors inherent to
physical laws. Our approach enforces two fundamental structures: the Riemannian
geometry of inertia, by parameterizing inertia matrices in their natural
mathematical space of symmetric positive-definite matrices, and the symplectic
geometry of phase space, using a constrained autoencoder to ensure the
preservation of phase space volume in a reduced latent space. We demonstrate
through experiments on systems ranging from coupled oscillators to
high-dimensional deformable objects that GeoHNN significantly outperforms
existing models. It achieves superior long-term stability, accuracy, and energy
conservation, confirming that embedding the geometry of physics is not just a
theoretical appeal but a practical necessity for creating robust and
generalizable models of the physical world.

Abstract: Electric vehicles (EV) charging stations are one of the critical
infrastructures needed to support the transition to renewable-energy-based

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel multi-agent ski-rental problem that generalizes
the classical ski-rental dilemma to a group setting where agents incur
individual and shared costs. In our model, each agent can either rent at a
fixed daily cost, or purchase a pass at an individual cost, with an additional
third option of a discounted group pass available to all. We consider scenarios
in which agents' active days differ, leading to dynamic states as agents drop
out of the decision process. To address this problem from different
perspectives, we define three distinct competitive ratios: overall,
state-dependent, and individual rational. For each objective, we design and
analyze optimal deterministic and randomized policies. Our deterministic
policies employ state-aware threshold functions that adapt to the dynamic
states, while our randomized policies sample and resample thresholds from
tailored state-aware distributions. The analysis reveals that symmetric
policies, in which all agents use the same threshold, outperform asymmetric
ones. Our results provide competitive ratio upper and lower bounds and extend
classical ski-rental insights to multi-agent settings, highlighting both
theoretical and practical implications for group decision-making under
uncertainty.

Abstract: Vehicular communication systems operating in the millimeter wave (mmWave)
band are highly susceptible to signal blockage from dynamic obstacles such as
vehicles, pedestrians, and infrastructure. To address this challenge, we
propose a proactive blockage prediction framework that utilizes multi-modal
sensing, including camera, GPS, LiDAR, and radar inputs in an
infrastructure-to-vehicle (I2V) setting. This approach uses modality-specific
deep learning models to process each sensor stream independently and fuses
their outputs using a softmax-weighted ensemble strategy based on validation
performance. Our evaluations, for up to 1.5s in advance, show that the
camera-only model achieves the best standalone trade-off with an F1-score of
97.1% and an inference time of 89.8ms. A camera+radar configuration further
improves accuracy to 97.2% F1 at 95.7ms. Our results display the effectiveness
and efficiency of multi-modal sensing for mmWave blockage prediction and
provide a pathway for proactive wireless communication in dynamic environments.

Abstract: Detecting stress in plants is crucial for both open-farm and
controlled-environment agriculture. Biomolecules within plants serve as key
stress indicators, offering vital markers for continuous health monitoring and
early disease detection. Raman spectroscopy provides a powerful, non-invasive
means to quantify these biomolecules through their molecular vibrational
signatures. However, traditional Raman analysis relies on customized
data-processing workflows that require fluorescence background removal and
prior identification of Raman peaks of interest-introducing potential biases
and inconsistencies. Here, we introduce DIVA (Deep-learning-based Investigation
of Vibrational Raman spectra for plant-stress Analysis), a fully automated
workflow based on a variational autoencoder. Unlike conventional approaches,
DIVA processes native Raman spectra-including fluorescence backgrounds-without
manual preprocessing, identifying and quantifying significant spectral features
in an unbiased manner. We applied DIVA to detect a range of plant stresses,
including abiotic (shading, high light intensity, high temperature) and biotic
stressors (bacterial infections). By integrating deep learning with vibrational
spectroscopy, DIVA paves the way for AI-driven plant health assessment,
fostering more resilient and sustainable agricultural practices.

empirical studies. We develop an original $\texttt{PRO-DYN}$ nomenclature to
analyze existing models through the lens of dynamics. Two observations thus
emerged: $\textbf{1}$. under-performing architectures learn dynamics at most
partially, $\textbf{2}$. the location of the dynamics block at the model end is
of prime importance. We conduct extensive experiments to confirm our
observations on a set of performance-varying models with diverse backbones.
Results support the need to incorporate a learnable dynamics block and its use
as the final predictor.

Abstract: Graph node classification is a fundamental task in graph neural networks
(GNNs), aiming to assign predefined class labels to nodes. On the PubMed
citation network dataset, we observe significant classification difficulty
disparities, with Category 2 achieving only 74.4% accuracy in traditional GCN,
7.5% lower than Category 1. To address this, we propose a
Wasserstein-Rubinstein (WR) distance enhanced Expert Fusion Model (WR-EFM),
training specialized GNN models for Categories 0/1 (with layer normalization
and residual connections) and Multi-hop Graph Attention Networks (GAT) for
Category 2. The WR distance metric optimizes representation similarity between
models, particularly focusing on improving Category 2 performance. Our adaptive
fusion strategy dynamically weights models based on category-specific
performance, with Category 2 assigned a GAT weight of 0.8. WR distance further
guides the fusion process by measuring distributional differences between model
representations, enabling more principled integration of complementary
features.
  Experimental results show WR-EFM achieves balanced accuracy across
categories: 77.8% (Category 0), 78.0% (Category 1), and 79.9% (Category 2),
outperforming both single models and standard fusion approaches. The
coefficient of variation (CV) of WR-EFM's category accuracies is 0.013, 77.6%
lower than GCN's 0.058, demonstrating superior stability. Notably, WR-EFM
improves Category 2 accuracy by 5.5% compared to GCN, verifying the
effectiveness of WR-guided fusion in capturing complex structural patterns.
This work provides a novel paradigm for handling class-imbalanced graph
classification tasks. To promote the research community, we release our project

Motivation: 探索RL方法能否为LLMs注入更复杂的社交智能（如ToM）。

Method: 使用RLVR训练小型LLMs，并在多个ToM数据集上评估其泛化能力。

Result: 小型LLMs无法获得通用ToM能力，训练仅提升特定任务表现，且易过拟合。

Conclusion: RLVR训练可能导致窄化过拟合，而非真正的抽象ToM能力。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated
emergent capabilities in complex reasoning, largely spurred by rule-based
Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques applied during the post-training. This
has raised the question of whether similar methods can instill more nuanced,
human-like social intelligence, such as a Theory of Mind (ToM), in LLMs. This
paper investigates whether small-scale LLMs can acquire a robust and
generalizable ToM capability through RL with verifiable rewards (RLVR). We
conduct a systematic evaluation by training models on various combinations of
prominent ToM datasets (HiToM, ExploreToM, FANToM) and testing for
generalization on held-out datasets (e.g., OpenToM). Our findings indicate that
small LLMs struggle to develop a generic ToM capability. While performance on
in-distribution tasks improves, this capability fails to transfer to unseen ToM
tasks with different characteristics. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
prolonged RL training leads to models ``hacking'' the statistical patterns of
the training datasets, resulting in significant performance gains on in-domain
data but no change, or degradation of performance on out-of-distribution tasks.
This suggests the learned behavior is a form of narrow overfitting rather than
the acquisition of a true, abstract ToM capability.

Motivation: 联邦分割学习（FSL）虽然减轻了边缘设备的计算负担，但仍存在高通信开销和服务器存储需求大的问题。

Result: 理论分析和实验结果表明，CSE-FSL在非凸损失函数下收敛，并显著降低了通信开销。

Conclusion: CSE-FSL是一种高效的联邦分割学习方法，适用于实际任务。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is one of the popular distributed machine learning
(ML) solutions but incurs significant communication and computation costs at
edge devices. Federated split learning (FSL) can train sub-models in parallel
and reduce the computational burden of edge devices by splitting the model
architecture. However, it still requires a high communication overhead due to
transmitting the smashed data and gradients between clients and the server in
every global round. Furthermore, the server must maintain separate partial
models for every client, leading to a significant storage requirement. To
address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel communication and storage
efficient federated split learning method, termed CSE-FSL, which utilizes an
auxiliary network to locally update the weights of the clients while keeping a
single model at the server, hence avoiding frequent transmissions of gradients
from the server and greatly reducing the storage requirement of the server.
Additionally, a new model update method of transmitting the smashed data in
selected epochs can reduce the amount of smashed data sent from the clients. We
provide a theoretical analysis of CSE-FSL, rigorously guaranteeing its
convergence under non-convex loss functions. The extensive experimental results
further indicate that CSE-FSL achieves a significant communication reduction
over existing FSL solutions using real-world FL tasks.

Abstract: To address the limitations of medium- and long-term four-dimensional (4D)
trajectory prediction models, this paper proposes a hybrid
CNN-LSTM-attention-adaboost neural network model incorporating a multi-strategy
improved snake-herd optimization (SO) algorithm. The model applies the Adaboost
algorithm to divide multiple weak learners, and each submodel utilizes CNN to
extract spatial features, LSTM to capture temporal features, and attention
mechanism to capture global features comprehensively. The strong learner model,
combined with multiple sub-models, then optimizes the hyperparameters of the
prediction model through the natural selection behavior pattern simulated by
SO. In this study, based on the real ADS-B data from Xi'an to Tianjin, the
comparison experiments and ablation studies of multiple optimizers are carried
out, and a comprehensive test and evaluation analysis is carried out. The
results show that SO-CLA-adaboost outperforms traditional optimizers such as

Abstract: In this work we study black-box privacy auditing, where the goal is to lower
bound the privacy parameter of a differentially private learning algorithm
using only the algorithm's outputs (i.e., final trained model). For DP-SGD (the
most successful method for training differentially private deep learning
models), the canonical approach auditing uses membership inference-an auditor
comes with a small set of special "canary" examples, inserts a random subset of
them into the training set, and then tries to discern which of their canaries
were included in the training set (typically via a membership inference
attack). The auditor's success rate then provides a lower bound on the privacy
parameters of the learning algorithm. Our main contribution is a method for
optimizing the auditor's canary set to improve privacy auditing, leveraging
recent work on metagradient optimization. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates
that by using such optimized canaries, we can improve empirical lower bounds
for differentially private image classification models by over 2x in certain
instances. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our method is transferable and
efficient: canaries optimized for non-private SGD with a small model
architecture remain effective when auditing larger models trained with DP-SGD.

Abstract: Synthetic data generation has emerged as an invaluable solution in scenarios
where real-world data collection and usage are limited by cost and scarcity.
Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
producing high-fidelity, domain-relevant samples across various fields.
However, existing approaches that directly use LLMs to generate each record
individually impose prohibitive time and cost burdens, particularly when large
volumes of synthetic data are required. In this work, we propose a fast,
cost-effective method for realistic tabular data synthesis that leverages LLMs
to infer and encode each field's distribution into a reusable sampling script.
By automatically classifying fields into numerical, categorical, or free-text
types, the LLM generates distribution-based scripts that can efficiently
produce diverse, realistic datasets at scale without continuous model
inference. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms traditional
direct methods in both diversity and data realism, substantially reducing the
burden of high-volume synthetic data generation. We plan to apply this
methodology to accelerate testing in production pipelines, thereby shortening
development cycles and improving overall system efficiency. We believe our
insights and lessons learned will aid researchers and practitioners seeking
scalable, cost-effective solutions for synthetic data generation.

### [312] [GUI-G$^2$: Gaussian Reward Modeling for GUI Grounding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15846)
*Fei Tang,Zhangxuan Gu,Zhengxi Lu,Xuyang Liu,Shuheng Shen,Changhua Meng,Wen Wang,Wenqi Zhang,Yongliang Shen,Weiming Lu,Jun Xiao,Yueting Zhuang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出GUI-G²，一种基于高斯分布的奖励框架，用于改进GUI定位任务中的稀疏奖励问题，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前强化学习方法在GUI定位任务中使用二元奖励，忽略了空间交互的连续性，而人类点击行为自然形成高斯分布，因此需要更连续的奖励框架。

Method: GUI-G²通过高斯点奖励和覆盖奖励建模连续空间交互，并引入自适应方差机制处理不同尺寸的元素。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，GUI-G²显著优于现有方法UI-TARS-72B，最高提升24.7%。

Conclusion: 连续建模提高了对界面变化的鲁棒性和对未见布局的泛化能力，为GUI交互任务中的空间推理提供了新范式。

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) grounding maps natural language instructions
to precise interface locations for autonomous interaction. Current
reinforcement learning approaches use binary rewards that treat elements as
hit-or-miss targets, creating sparse signals that ignore the continuous nature
of spatial interactions. Motivated by human clicking behavior that naturally
forms Gaussian distributions centered on target elements, we introduce GUI
Gaussian Grounding Rewards (GUI-G$^2$), a principled reward framework that
models GUI elements as continuous Gaussian distributions across the interface
plane. GUI-G$^2$ incorporates two synergistic mechanisms: Gaussian point
rewards model precise localization through exponentially decaying distributions
centered on element centroids, while coverage rewards assess spatial alignment
by measuring the overlap between predicted Gaussian distributions and target
regions. To handle diverse element scales, we develop an adaptive variance
mechanism that calibrates reward distributions based on element dimensions.
This framework transforms GUI grounding from sparse binary classification to
dense continuous optimization, where Gaussian distributions generate rich
gradient signals that guide models toward optimal interaction positions.
Extensive experiments across ScreenSpot, ScreenSpot-v2, and ScreenSpot-Pro
benchmarks demonstrate that GUI-G$^2$, substantially outperforms
state-of-the-art method UI-TARS-72B, with the most significant improvement of
24.7% on ScreenSpot-Pro. Our analysis reveals that continuous modeling provides
superior robustness to interface variations and enhanced generalization to
unseen layouts, establishing a new paradigm for spatial reasoning in GUI
interaction tasks.
