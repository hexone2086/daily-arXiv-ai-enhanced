*Aryan Mathur,Asaduddin Ahmed,Pushti Amit Vasoya,Simeon Kandan Sonar,Yasir Z,Madesh Kuppusamy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个可解释的图像真实性检测系统，结合轻量级卷积分类器和视觉语言模型，在32x32低分辨率图像上实现96.5%的准确率，并能定位和解释视觉伪影。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI生成图像的真实感不断增强，验证视觉真实性面临挑战，需要开发能够检测、定位和解释图像伪影的系统。

Method: 使用轻量级卷积分类器(Faster-Than-Lies)结合视觉语言模型(Qwen2-VL-7B)，通过自编码器重建误差图生成伪影定位热力图，并将70种视觉伪影分为8个语义组。

Result: 在扩展的CiFAKE数据集上达到96.5%的准确率，在8核CPU上推理时间为175ms，能够生成可解释的文本描述检测到的异常。

Conclusion: 该工作证明了结合视觉和语言推理在低分辨率图像中进行可解释真实性检测的可行性，并展示了在取证、工业检测和社交媒体审核等领域的潜在应用。

Abstract: The increasing realism of AI-generated imagery poses challenges for verifying
visual authenticity. We present an explainable image authenticity detection
system that combines a lightweight convolutional classifier
("Faster-Than-Lies") with a Vision-Language Model (Qwen2-VL-7B) to classify,
localize, and explain artifacts in 32x32 images. Our model achieves 96.5%
accuracy on the extended CiFAKE dataset augmented with adversarial
perturbations and maintains an inference time of 175ms on 8-core CPUs, enabling
deployment on local or edge devices. Using autoencoder-based reconstruction
error maps, we generate artifact localization heatmaps, which enhance
interpretability for both humans and the VLM. We further categorize 70 visual
artifact types into eight semantic groups and demonstrate explainable text
generation for each detected anomaly. This work highlights the feasibility of
combining visual and linguistic reasoning for interpretable authenticity
detection in low-resolution imagery and outlines potential cross-domain
applications in forensics, industrial inspection, and social media moderation.

### [2] [CountFormer: A Transformer Framework for Learning Visual Repetition and Structure in Class-Agnostic Object Counting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23785)
*Md Tanvir Hossain,Akif Islam,Mohd Ruhul Ameen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CountFormer是一个基于transformer的类无关物体计数框架，通过识别视觉重复和结构关系来实现人类式的计数能力，在复杂形状和密集场景中表现优异


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有计数模型在物体具有复杂形状、内部对称或重叠组件时容易出错，无法像人类那样通过感知视觉重复和结构关系来计数

Method: 基于CounTR架构，用自监督基础模型DINOv2替换视觉编码器，加入位置嵌入融合来保持几何关系，通过轻量卷积解码器生成密度图

Result: 在FSC-147数据集上达到与当前最先进方法相当的性能，在结构复杂或密集场景中表现出更优的准确性

Conclusion: 集成DINOv2等基础模型使计数系统能够接近人类的结构感知能力，朝着真正通用且无需示例的计数范式迈进

Abstract: Humans can effortlessly count diverse objects by perceiving visual repetition
and structural relationships rather than relying on class identity. However,
most existing counting models fail to replicate this ability; they often
miscount when objects exhibit complex shapes, internal symmetry, or overlapping
components. In this work, we introduce CountFormer, a transformer-based
framework that learns to recognize repetition and structural coherence for
class-agnostic object counting. Built upon the CounTR architecture, our model
replaces its visual encoder with the self-supervised foundation model DINOv2,
which produces richer and spatially consistent feature representations. We
further incorporate positional embedding fusion to preserve geometric
relationships before decoding these features into density maps through a
lightweight convolutional decoder. Evaluated on the FSC-147 dataset, our model
achieves performance comparable to current state-of-the-art methods while
demonstrating superior accuracy on structurally intricate or densely packed
scenes. Our findings indicate that integrating foundation models such as DINOv2
enables counting systems to approach human-like structural perception,
advancing toward a truly general and exemplar-free counting paradigm.

### [3] [A geometric and deep learning reproducible pipeline for monitoring floating anthropogenic debris in urban rivers using in situ cameras](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23798)
*Gauthier Grimmer,Romain Wenger,Clément Flint,Germain Forestier,Gilles Rixhon,Valentin Chardon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于固定摄像头的深度学习框架，用于河流漂浮垃圾的自动监测和量化，包括物体尺寸估计和模型性能评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 河流中漂浮的人为垃圾对生物多样性、水质和人类活动造成严重影响，需要开发有效的监测方法。

Method: 使用固定原位摄像头采集数据，应用深度学习模型进行垃圾检测和量化，结合几何模型从2D图像估计物体实际尺寸，测试不同环境条件和学习配置。

Result: 验证了基于投影几何和回归校正的度量物体估计方法的可行性，强调了数据集构建协议的重要性，特别是负样本整合和时间泄漏考虑。

Conclusion: 该方法为开发低成本、鲁棒的自动化城市水环境监测系统奠定了基础。

Abstract: The proliferation of floating anthropogenic debris in rivers has emerged as a
pressing environmental concern, exerting a detrimental influence on
biodiversity, water quality, and human activities such as navigation and
recreation. The present study proposes a novel methodological framework for the
monitoring the aforementioned waste, utilising fixed, in-situ cameras. This
study provides two key contributions: (i) the continuous quantification and
monitoring of floating debris using deep learning and (ii) the identification
of the most suitable deep learning model in terms of accuracy and inference
speed under complex environmental conditions. These models are tested in a
range of environmental conditions and learning configurations, including
experiments on biases related to data leakage. Furthermore, a geometric model
is implemented to estimate the actual size of detected objects from a 2D image.
This model takes advantage of both intrinsic and extrinsic characteristics of
the camera. The findings of this study underscore the significance of the
dataset constitution protocol, particularly with respect to the integration of
negative images and the consideration of temporal leakage. In conclusion, the
feasibility of metric object estimation using projective geometry coupled with
regression corrections is demonstrated. This approach paves the way for the
development of robust, low-cost, automated monitoring systems for urban aquatic
environments.

### [4] [RareFlow: Physics-Aware Flow-Matching for Cross-Sensor Super-Resolution of Rare-Earth Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23816)
*Forouzan Fallah,Wenwen Li,Chia-Yu Hsu,Hyunho Lee,Yezhou Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RareFlow是一个面向遥感图像超分辨率的物理感知框架，专门解决分布外条件下的鲁棒性问题，通过双条件架构和不确定性量化来避免特征幻觉。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 遥感图像超分辨率在分布外条件下（如不同传感器捕获的罕见地貌特征）经常失败，产生视觉上合理但物理上不准确的结果。

Method: 采用双条件架构：门控ControlNet保持低分辨率输入的几何保真度，文本提示提供复杂特征的语义指导；引入多面损失函数确保光谱和辐射一致性；使用随机前向传播量化预测不确定性。

Result: 在盲评中，地球物理专家认为模型输出接近真实图像保真度，显著优于最先进基线；感知指标定量提升，FID降低近40%。

Conclusion: RareFlow为数据稀缺科学领域提供了高保真合成的鲁棒框架，并为严重域偏移下的受控生成提供了新范式。

Abstract: Super-resolution (SR) for remote sensing imagery often fails under
out-of-distribution (OOD) conditions, such as rare geomorphic features captured
by diverse sensors, producing visually plausible but physically inaccurate
results. We present RareFlow, a physics-aware SR framework designed for OOD
robustness. RareFlow's core is a dual-conditioning architecture. A Gated
ControlNet preserves fine-grained geometric fidelity from the low-resolution
input, while textual prompts provide semantic guidance for synthesizing complex
features. To ensure physically sound outputs, we introduce a multifaceted loss
function that enforces both spectral and radiometric consistency with sensor
properties. Furthermore, the framework quantifies its own predictive
uncertainty by employing a stochastic forward pass approach; the resulting
output variance directly identifies unfamiliar inputs, mitigating feature
hallucination. We validate RareFlow on a new, curated benchmark of multi-sensor
satellite imagery. In blind evaluations, geophysical experts rated our model's
outputs as approaching the fidelity of ground truth imagery, significantly
outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. This qualitative superiority is
corroborated by quantitative gains in perceptual metrics, including a nearly
40\% reduction in FID. RareFlow provides a robust framework for high-fidelity
synthesis in data-scarce scientific domains and offers a new paradigm for
controlled generation under severe domain shift.

### [5] [TRELLISWorld: Training-Free World Generation from Object Generators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23880)
*Hanke Chen,Yuan Liu,Minchen Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练的3D场景生成方法，通过将通用文本到3D对象扩散模型重新用作模块化瓦片生成器，实现大规模连贯场景的合成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D场景生成方法通常局限于单对象生成、需要领域特定训练或缺乏360度全景支持，限制了应用范围。

Method: 将场景生成重新定义为多瓦片去噪问题，独立生成重叠的3D区域并通过加权平均无缝融合，实现可扩展的场景合成。

Result: 该方法支持多样化的场景布局、高效生成和灵活编辑，无需场景级数据集或重新训练，继承了对象级先验的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 建立了一个简单而强大的基础，用于通用语言驱动的3D场景构建，在虚拟原型、AR/VR和仿真等领域具有广泛应用前景。

Abstract: Text-driven 3D scene generation holds promise for a wide range of
applications, from virtual prototyping to AR/VR and simulation. However,
existing methods are often constrained to single-object generation, require
domain-specific training, or lack support for full 360-degree viewability. In
this work, we present a training-free approach to 3D scene synthesis by
repurposing general-purpose text-to-3D object diffusion models as modular tile
generators. We reformulate scene generation as a multi-tile denoising problem,
where overlapping 3D regions are independently generated and seamlessly blended
via weighted averaging. This enables scalable synthesis of large, coherent
scenes while preserving local semantic control. Our method eliminates the need
for scene-level datasets or retraining, relies on minimal heuristics, and
inherits the generalization capabilities of object-level priors. We demonstrate
that our approach supports diverse scene layouts, efficient generation, and
flexible editing, establishing a simple yet powerful foundation for
general-purpose, language-driven 3D scene construction.

### [6] [Improving Visual Discriminability of CLIP for Training-Free Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23894)
*Jinxin Zhou,Jiachen Jiang,Zhihui Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LHT-CLIP是一个无需训练的分割框架，通过层、头、令牌三个层面的视觉判别性分析，提出语义空间重加权、选择性头增强和异常令牌替换技术，在8个分割基准上达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP模型的图像级预训练目标与分割所需的像素级视觉理解存在不对齐问题，先前方法继承了前层的全局对齐偏差，导致分割性能不佳。

Method: 通过分析发现：最后几层牺牲视觉判别性来增强图像-文本对齐；部分注意力头具有强视觉判别性；异常令牌具有稀疏激活模式。基于此提出三种技术：语义空间重加权、选择性头增强、异常令牌替换。

Result: 在8个常见语义分割基准测试中，LHT-CLIP实现了最先进的性能，无需额外训练、辅助预训练网络或大量超参数调优。

Conclusion: LHT-CLIP通过系统利用CLIP在层、头、令牌层面的视觉判别性，有效恢复了视觉判别能力并提升了分割性能，展示了其在真实世界部署的有效性和实用性。

Abstract: Extending CLIP models to semantic segmentation remains challenging due to the
misalignment between their image-level pre-training objectives and the
pixel-level visual understanding required for dense prediction. While prior
efforts have achieved encouraging results by reorganizing the final layer and
features, they often inherit the global alignment bias of preceding layers,
leading to suboptimal segmentation performance. In this work, we propose
LHT-CLIP, a novel training-free framework that systematically exploits the
visual discriminability of CLIP across layer, head, and token levels. Through
comprehensive analysis, we reveal three key insights: (i) the final layers
primarily strengthen image-text alignment with sacrifice of visual
discriminability (e.g., last 3 layers in ViT-B/16 and 8 layers in ViT-L/14),
partly due to the emergence of anomalous tokens; (ii) a subset of attention
heads (e.g., 10 out of 144 in ViT-B/16) display consistently strong visual
discriminability across datasets; (iii) abnormal tokens display sparse and
consistent activation pattern compared to normal tokens. Based on these
findings, we propose three complementary techniques: semantic-spatial
reweighting, selective head enhancement, and abnormal token replacement to
effectively restore visual discriminability and improve segmentation
performance without any additional training, auxiliary pre-trained networks, or
extensive hyperparameter tuning. Extensive experiments on 8 common semantic
segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that LHT-CLIP achieves state-of-the-art
performance across diverse scenarios, highlighting its effectiveness and
practicality for real-world deployment.

### [7] [DynaStride: Dynamic Stride Windowing with MMCoT for Instructional Multi-Scene Captioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23907)
*Eddison Pham,Prisha Priyadarshini,Adrian Maliackel,Kanishk Bandi,Cristian Meo,Kevin Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DynaStride是一个无需手动场景分割的管道，通过自适应帧采样和多模态窗口技术生成连贯的场景级视频字幕，在YouCookII数据集上优于VLLaMA3和GPT-4o等基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 教学视频中的场景级字幕需要理解视觉线索和时间结构，但现有字幕缺乏这种结构会导致不连贯和质量低下，影响教育效果。

Method: 使用自适应帧采样和多模态窗口捕捉关键转换，采用多模态思维链生成多个动作-对象对，通过动态步长窗口选择算法平衡时间上下文和冗余，最终生成融合视觉语义和时间推理的教学字幕。

Result: 在N-gram指标（BLEU、METEOR）和语义相似度指标（BERTScore、CLIPScore）上均优于基线模型，定性分析显示生成的字幕具有更好的时间连贯性和信息量。

Conclusion: DynaStride为改进AI驱动的教学内容生成提供了一个有前景的方向，能够产生更连贯和信息丰富的场景级字幕。

Abstract: Scene-level captioning in instructional videos can enhance learning by
requiring an understanding of both visual cues and temporal structure. By
aligning visual cues with textual guidance, this understanding supports
procedural learning and multimodal reasoning, providing a richer context for
skill acquisition. However, captions that fail to capture this structure may
lack coherence and quality, which can create confusion and undermine the
video's educational intent. To address this gap, we introduce DynaStride, a
pipeline to generate coherent, scene-level captions without requiring manual
scene segmentation. Using the YouCookII dataset's scene annotations, DynaStride
performs adaptive frame sampling and multimodal windowing to capture key
transitions within each scene. It then employs a multimodal chain-of-thought
process to produce multiple action-object pairs, which are refined and fused
using a dynamic stride window selection algorithm that adaptively balances
temporal context and redundancy. The final scene-level caption integrates
visual semantics and temporal reasoning in a single instructional caption.
Empirical evaluations against strong baselines, including VLLaMA3 and GPT-4o,
demonstrate consistent gains on both N-gram-based metrics (BLEU, METEOR) and
semantic similarity measures (BERTScore, CLIPScore). Qualitative analyses
further show that DynaStride produces captions that are more temporally
coherent and informative, suggesting a promising direction for improving
AI-powered instructional content generation.

### [8] [TurboPortrait3D: Single-step diffusion-based fast portrait novel-view synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23929)
*Emily Kim,Julieta Martinez,Timur Bagautdinov,Jessica Hodgins*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TurboPortrait3D是一种低延迟的人像新视角合成方法，通过结合图像到3D模型和扩散模型，在保持3D感知的同时显著提升生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的人像图像到3D模型存在视觉伪影、细节缺失和身份保持不足的问题，而图像扩散模型虽然能生成高质量图像但缺乏3D一致性且计算成本高。

Method: 使用前馈图像到虚拟化身生成流程获得初始3D表示和噪声渲染，然后通过单步扩散模型在输入图像条件下进行多视角一致的精炼，采用合成多视角数据预训练和高质量真实图像微调的训练策略。

Result: 该方法在质量和数量上都优于当前最先进的人像新视角合成方法，同时保持时间效率。

Conclusion: 图像空间扩散模型可以有效提升图像到虚拟化身方法的生成质量，同时保持3D感知和低延迟运行。

Abstract: We introduce TurboPortrait3D: a method for low-latency novel-view synthesis
of human portraits. Our approach builds on the observation that existing
image-to-3D models for portrait generation, while capable of producing
renderable 3D representations, are prone to visual artifacts, often lack of
detail, and tend to fail at fully preserving the identity of the subject. On
the other hand, image diffusion models excel at generating high-quality images,
but besides being computationally expensive, are not grounded in 3D and thus
are not directly capable of producing multi-view consistent outputs. In this
work, we demonstrate that image-space diffusion models can be used to
significantly enhance the quality of existing image-to-avatar methods, while
maintaining 3D-awareness and running with low-latency. Our method takes a
single frontal image of a subject as input, and applies a feedforward
image-to-avatar generation pipeline to obtain an initial 3D representation and
corresponding noisy renders. These noisy renders are then fed to a single-step
diffusion model which is conditioned on input image(s), and is specifically
trained to refine the renders in a multi-view consistent way. Moreover, we
introduce a novel effective training strategy that includes pre-training on a
large corpus of synthetic multi-view data, followed by fine-tuning on
high-quality real images. We demonstrate that our approach both qualitatively
and quantitatively outperforms current state-of-the-art for portrait novel-view
synthesis, while being efficient in time.

### [9] [PlanarGS: High-Fidelity Indoor 3D Gaussian Splatting Guided by Vision-Language Planar Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23930)
*Xirui Jin,Renbiao Jin,Boying Li,Danping Zou,Wenxian Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PlanarGS是一种基于3D高斯溅射的室内场景重建框架，通过引入语言提示平面先验和几何先验监督，解决了传统3DGS在低纹理区域几何重建模糊的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统3D高斯溅射在大面积低纹理区域（如室内场景）中，仅使用光度损失会导致几何重建模糊，无法恢复高保真3D表面。

Method: 设计了语言提示平面先验（LP3）管道，使用预训练视觉语言分割模型并通过跨视图融合和几何先验检查来优化区域提议；在3D高斯优化中增加了平面先验监督项和几何先验监督项。

Result: 在标准室内基准测试中，PlanarGS重建出准确详细的3D表面，大幅优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: PlanarGS通过结合平面和几何先验，有效提升了室内场景的3D重建质量，解决了3DGS在低纹理区域的局限性。

Abstract: Three-dimensional Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently emerged as an
efficient representation for novel-view synthesis, achieving impressive visual
quality. However, in scenes dominated by large and low-texture regions, common
in indoor environments, the photometric loss used to optimize 3DGS yields
ambiguous geometry and fails to recover high-fidelity 3D surfaces. To overcome
this limitation, we introduce PlanarGS, a 3DGS-based framework tailored for
indoor scene reconstruction. Specifically, we design a pipeline for
Language-Prompted Planar Priors (LP3) that employs a pretrained vision-language
segmentation model and refines its region proposals via cross-view fusion and
inspection with geometric priors. 3D Gaussians in our framework are optimized
with two additional terms: a planar prior supervision term that enforces planar
consistency, and a geometric prior supervision term that steers the Gaussians
toward the depth and normal cues. We have conducted extensive experiments on
standard indoor benchmarks. The results show that PlanarGS reconstructs
accurate and detailed 3D surfaces, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art
methods by a large margin. Project page: https://planargs.github.io

### [10] [Adaptive Training of INRs via Pruning and Densification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23943)
*Diana Aldana,João Paulo Lima,Daniel Csillag,Daniel Perazzo,Haoan Feng,Luiz Velho,Tiago Novello*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AIRe是一种自适应训练方案，通过神经元剪枝和输入频率密集化来优化隐式神经表示(INR)架构，在减少模型大小的同时保持或提升重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的隐式神经表示方法在输入频率选择和架构设计上依赖启发式方法和繁重的超参数优化，存在参数冗余问题。

Method: 使用神经元剪枝机制避免冗余，通过目标权重衰减将信息转移到剩余神经元，然后进行结构化剪枝；通过输入频率密集化在信号欠拟合的频谱区域添加频率。

Result: 在图像和SDF上的实验表明，AIRe在减少模型大小的同时保持甚至提升了重建质量。

Conclusion: AIRe提供了一种改进的网络大小与重建质量之间的权衡方案，代码和预训练模型将公开发布。

Abstract: Encoding input coordinates with sinusoidal functions into multilayer
perceptrons (MLPs) has proven effective for implicit neural representations
(INRs) of low-dimensional signals, enabling the modeling of high-frequency
details. However, selecting appropriate input frequencies and architectures
while managing parameter redundancy remains an open challenge, often addressed
through heuristics and heavy hyperparameter optimization schemes. In this
paper, we introduce AIRe ($\textbf{A}$daptive $\textbf{I}$mplicit neural
$\textbf{Re}$presentation), an adaptive training scheme that refines the INR
architecture over the course of optimization. Our method uses a neuron pruning
mechanism to avoid redundancy and input frequency densification to improve
representation capacity, leading to an improved trade-off between network size
and reconstruction quality. For pruning, we first identify less-contributory
neurons and apply a targeted weight decay to transfer their information to the
remaining neurons, followed by structured pruning. Next, the densification
stage adds input frequencies to spectrum regions where the signal underfits,
expanding the representational basis. Through experiments on images and SDFs,
we show that AIRe reduces model size while preserving, or even improving,
reconstruction quality. Code and pretrained models will be released for public
use.

### [11] [Neural USD: An object-centric framework for iterative editing and control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23956)
*Alejandro Escontrela,Shrinu Kushagra,Sjoerd van Steenkiste,Yulia Rubanova,Aleksander Holynski,Kelsey Allen,Kevin Murphy,Thomas Kipf*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了Neural USD框架，通过结构化、层次化的方式表示场景和对象，实现精确的迭代式对象编辑，解决了现有方法在编辑特定对象时导致全局变化的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前可控生成模型在精确迭代编辑方面存在挑战，改变条件信号时往往导致场景的全局变化，无法实现特定对象的精确编辑。

Method: 借鉴计算机图形学中的USD标准，引入Neural USD框架，采用结构化层次化表示场景和对象，应用微调方法确保控制信号的解耦。

Result: 评估了框架的多个设计考虑，展示了Neural USD如何支持迭代和增量式工作流程。

Conclusion: Neural USD框架为精确的对象编辑提供了可行的解决方案，实现了对对象外观、几何和姿态的独立控制。

Abstract: Amazing progress has been made in controllable generative modeling,
especially over the last few years. However, some challenges remain. One of
them is precise and iterative object editing. In many of the current methods,
trying to edit the generated image (for example, changing the color of a
particular object in the scene or changing the background while keeping other
elements unchanged) by changing the conditioning signals often leads to
unintended global changes in the scene. In this work, we take the first steps
to address the above challenges. Taking inspiration from the Universal Scene
Descriptor (USD) standard developed in the computer graphics community, we
introduce the "Neural Universal Scene Descriptor" or Neural USD. In this
framework, we represent scenes and objects in a structured, hierarchical
manner. This accommodates diverse signals, minimizes model-specific
constraints, and enables per-object control over appearance, geometry, and
pose. We further apply a fine-tuning approach which ensures that the above
control signals are disentangled from one another. We evaluate several design
considerations for our framework, demonstrating how Neural USD enables
iterative and incremental workflows. More information at:

*Peiyang Xu,Minzhou Pan,Zhaorun Chen,Shuang Yang,Chaowei Xiao,Bo Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SafeVision是一个创新的图像护栏系统，通过集成类人推理来增强适应性和透明度，无需重新训练即可动态适应不断发展的安全策略，在多个基准测试中实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图像护栏模型受限于预定义类别，缺乏语义推理能力，难以适应新兴威胁且需要昂贵的重新训练。

Method: 采用有效的数据收集和生成框架、策略遵循训练流程、定制化损失函数，以及多样化的QA生成和训练策略。

Result: 在VisionHarm-T上比GPT-4o提升8.6%，在VisionHarm-C上提升15.5%，速度提升超过16倍。

Conclusion: SafeVision建立了一个全面、策略遵循且可解释的图像护栏系统，能够动态适应新兴威胁。

Abstract: With the rapid proliferation of digital media, the need for efficient and
transparent safeguards against unsafe content is more critical than ever.
Traditional image guardrail models, constrained by predefined categories, often
misclassify content due to their pure feature-based learning without semantic
reasoning. Moreover, these models struggle to adapt to emerging threats,
requiring costly retraining for new threats. To address these limitations, we
introduce SafeVision, a novel image guardrail that integrates human-like
reasoning to enhance adaptability and transparency. Our approach incorporates
an effective data collection and generation framework, a policy-following
training pipeline, and a customized loss function. We also propose a diverse QA
generation and training strategy to enhance learning effectiveness. SafeVision
dynamically aligns with evolving safety policies at inference time, eliminating
the need for retraining while ensuring precise risk assessments and
explanations. Recognizing the limitations of existing unsafe image benchmarks,
which either lack granularity or cover limited risks, we introduce VisionHarm,
a high-quality dataset comprising two subsets: VisionHarm Third-party
(VisionHarm-T) and VisionHarm Comprehensive(VisionHarm-C), spanning diverse
harmful categories. Through extensive experiments, we show that SafeVision
achieves state-of-the-art performance on different benchmarks. SafeVision
outperforms GPT-4o by 8.6% on VisionHarm-T and by 15.5% on VisionHarm-C, while
being over 16x faster. SafeVision sets a comprehensive, policy-following, and
explainable image guardrail with dynamic adaptation to emerging threats.

TL;DR: 提出了一个将链式思维推理引入胸部X光解读的框架，通过两阶段训练生成可解释的推理过程，提高临床可信度和人机协作安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在医学图像分析中缺乏透明推理过程，无法提供临床医生依赖的逐步推理，限制了其在医疗环境中的应用可信度。

Method: 采用两阶段训练：基于推理风格的监督微调，然后使用可验证奖励的强化学习，模型输出包含系统思维过程、不确定性和鉴别诊断的推理。

Result: 在分布外评估中实现竞争性多标签分类，同时提高可解释性；在专家放射科医生阅读研究中，完整推理轨迹增强了信心，支持错误审计，并减少了报告定稿时间。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持准确性的同时显著提高了模型的可解释性和临床实用性，为胸部放射学及其他医学成像任务中可信赖、可解释AI的发展提供了支持。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown strong promise for medical image
analysis, but most remain opaque, offering predictions without the transparent,
stepwise reasoning clinicians rely on. We present a framework that brings
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning to chest X-ray interpretation. Inspired by
reasoning-first training paradigms, our approach is designed to learn how
experts reason, not just what they conclude, by aligning intermediate steps
with observable image evidence and radiology workflow. Beyond accuracy, the
explicit reasoning traces support clinical auditability: they reveal why a
conclusion was reached, which alternatives were considered, and where
uncertainty remains, enabling quality assurance, error analysis, and safer
human-AI collaboration.
  Our model couples high-fidelity visual encoding with a two-stage training
recipe: a reasoning-style supervised fine-tuning (SFT) followed by
reinforcement learning (RL) that uses verifiable rewards over a list of X-ray
abnormalities. The model outputs reasoning that mirrors radiologists systematic
thought process, uncertainty, and differential diagnosis. In
out-of-distribution evaluation, the approach achieves competitive multi-label
classification while improving interpretability. In a reader study with expert
radiologists, full reasoning traces increased confidence, supported error
auditing, and reduced time to finalize reports. We release code and the model
NV-Reason-CXR-3B to support community progress toward trustworthy, explainable
AI in chest radiography and other medical imaging tasks where reasoning quality
is as critical as prediction quality.

Abstract: Cost-and-Quality (CQ) controllability in arbitrary-scale super-resolution is
crucial. Existing methods predict Fourier components one by one using a
recurrent neural network. However, this approach leads to performance
degradation and inefficiency due to independent prediction. This paper proposes
predicting multiple components jointly to improve both quality and efficiency.

TL;DR: TeleEgo是一个长时、流式、全模态的基准测试，用于在真实日常场景中评估自我中心AI助手，包含14+小时的多模态数据和3,291个人工验证的QA项目，涵盖记忆、理解和跨记忆推理三大核心能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试通常孤立评估AI助手能力，缺乏真实流式场景，或仅支持短期任务，无法满足现实世界中自我中心AI助手处理多模态输入、实时响应和保持长期记忆的需求。

Method: 构建包含工作学习、生活方式、社交活动和外出文化四个领域的同步自我中心视频、音频和文本数据集，所有数据在统一时间线上对齐，并通过人工精炼获得高质量视觉叙述和语音转录。定义了12个诊断子任务和两种关键指标。

Result: TeleEgo提供了超过14小时/参与者的多模态数据，包含3,291个经过人工验证的QA项目，支持多种问题格式，并在严格流式设置下进行评估。

Conclusion: TeleEgo为开发实用AI助手提供了现实且全面的评估框架，通过实时准确性和记忆持久时间等指标联合评估正确性、时间响应性和长期记忆能力。

Abstract: Egocentric AI assistants in real-world settings must process multi-modal
inputs (video, audio, text), respond in real time, and retain evolving
long-term memory. However, existing benchmarks typically evaluate these
abilities in isolation, lack realistic streaming scenarios, or support only
short-term tasks. We introduce \textbf{TeleEgo}, a long-duration, streaming,
omni-modal benchmark for evaluating egocentric AI assistants in realistic daily
contexts. The dataset features over 14 hours per participant of synchronized
egocentric video, audio, and text across four domains: work \& study, lifestyle
\& routines, social activities, and outings \& culture. All data is aligned on
a unified global timeline and includes high-quality visual narrations and
speech transcripts, curated through human refinement.TeleEgo defines 12
diagnostic subtasks across three core capabilities: Memory (recalling past
events), Understanding (interpreting the current moment), and Cross-Memory
Reasoning (linking distant events). It contains 3,291 human-verified QA items
spanning multiple question formats (single-choice, binary, multi-choice, and
open-ended), evaluated strictly in a streaming setting. We propose two key
metrics -- Real-Time Accuracy and Memory Persistence Time -- to jointly assess
correctness, temporal responsiveness, and long-term retention. TeleEgo provides
a realistic and comprehensive evaluation to advance the development of
practical AI assistants.

Conclusion: AdvBlur方法通过对抗性模糊和双损失函数有效提升了糖尿病视网膜病变分类模型的领域泛化能力。

Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of vision loss worldwide, yet
early and accurate detection can significantly improve treatment outcomes.
While numerous Deep learning (DL) models have been developed to predict DR from
fundus images, many face challenges in maintaining robustness due to
distributional variations caused by differences in acquisition devices,
demographic disparities, and imaging conditions. This paper addresses this
critical limitation by proposing a novel DR classification approach, a method
called AdvBlur. Our method integrates adversarial blurred images into the
dataset and employs a dual-loss function framework to address domain
generalization. This approach effectively mitigates the impact of unseen
distributional variations, as evidenced by comprehensive evaluations across
multiple datasets. Additionally, we conduct extensive experiments to explore
the effects of factors such as camera type, low-quality images, and dataset
size. Furthermore, we perform ablation studies on blurred images and the loss
function to ensure the validity of our choices. The experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, achieving competitive
performance compared to state-of-the-art domain generalization DR models on
unseen external datasets.

Abstract: The automated analysis of the aortic vessel tree (AVT) from computed
tomography angiography (CTA) holds immense clinical potential, but its
development has been impeded by a lack of shared, high-quality data. We
launched the SEG.A. challenge to catalyze progress in this field by introducing
a large, publicly available, multi-institutional dataset for AVT segmentation.
The challenge benchmarked automated algorithms on a hidden test set, with
subsequent optional tasks in surface meshing for computational simulations. Our
findings reveal a clear convergence on deep learning methodologies, with 3D
U-Net architectures dominating the top submissions. A key result was that an
ensemble of the highest-ranking algorithms significantly outperformed
individual models, highlighting the benefits of model fusion. Performance was
strongly linked to algorithmic design, particularly the use of customized
post-processing steps, and the characteristics of the training data. This
initiative not only establishes a new performance benchmark but also provides a

Conclusion: Mars-Bench旨在为火星科学的机器学习模型开发和比较建立标准化基础，促进火星特定基础模型的发展。

Abstract: Foundation models have enabled rapid progress across many specialized domains
by leveraging large-scale pre-training on unlabeled data, demonstrating strong
generalization to a variety of downstream tasks. While such models have gained
significant attention in fields like Earth Observation, their application to
Mars science remains limited. A key enabler of progress in other domains has
been the availability of standardized benchmarks that support systematic
evaluation. In contrast, Mars science lacks such benchmarks and standardized
evaluation frameworks, which have limited progress toward developing foundation
models for Martian tasks. To address this gap, we introduce Mars-Bench, the
first benchmark designed to systematically evaluate models across a broad range
of Mars-related tasks using both orbital and surface imagery. Mars-Bench
comprises 20 datasets spanning classification, segmentation, and object
detection, focused on key geologic features such as craters, cones, boulders,
and frost. We provide standardized, ready-to-use datasets and baseline
evaluations using models pre-trained on natural images, Earth satellite data,
and state-of-the-art vision-language models. Results from all analyses suggest
that Mars-specific foundation models may offer advantages over general-domain
counterparts, motivating further exploration of domain-adapted pre-training.
Mars-Bench aims to establish a standardized foundation for developing and
comparing machine learning models for Mars science. Our data, models, and code

Motivation: 当前文本到图像模型的安全机制容易受到对抗性提示的攻击，但现有的红队方法需要白盒访问、效率低下且生成的提示语义无意义容易被过滤器拦截。

Method: 提出交替优化-微调流水线，在对抗性后缀优化和LLM微调之间交替进行；集成双重规避策略：通过辅助LLM困惑度评分确保人类可读性，引入禁止词惩罚抑制黑名单词汇生成。

Conclusion: APT框架成功解决了现有红队方法的局限性，提供了一种高效、可迁移的黑盒对抗性提示生成方法，能够有效评估文本到图像模型的安全漏洞。

Abstract: Despite rapid advancements in text-to-image (T2I) models, their safety
mechanisms are vulnerable to adversarial prompts, which maliciously generate
unsafe images. Current red-teaming methods for proactively assessing such
vulnerabilities usually require white-box access to T2I models, and rely on
inefficient per-prompt optimization, as well as inevitably generate
semantically meaningless prompts easily blocked by filters. In this paper, we
propose APT (AutoPrompT), a black-box framework that leverages large language
models (LLMs) to automatically generate human-readable adversarial suffixes for
benign prompts. We first introduce an alternating optimization-finetuning
pipeline between adversarial suffix optimization and fine-tuning the LLM
utilizing the optimized suffix. Furthermore, we integrates a dual-evasion
strategy in optimization phase, enabling the bypass of both perplexity-based
filter and blacklist word filter: (1) we constrain the LLM generating
human-readable prompts through an auxiliary LLM perplexity scoring, which
starkly contrasts with prior token-level gibberish, and (2) we also introduce
banned-token penalties to suppress the explicit generation of banned-tokens in
blacklist. Extensive experiments demonstrate the excellent red-teaming
performance of our human-readable, filter-resistant adversarial prompts, as
well as superior zero-shot transferability which enables instant adaptation to
unseen prompts and exposes critical vulnerabilities even in commercial APIs
(e.g., Leonardo.Ai.).

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) has revolutionized computer vision, but
training very deep networks has been challenging due to the vanishing gradient

enables the training of networks with hundreds of layers by allowing gradients
to flow directly through shortcut connections that bypass intermediate layers.

accuracy compared to 84.1% for a traditional deep CNN of similar depth, while
also converging faster and training more stably.

TL;DR: SNELLA是一种单阶段参数高效微调方法，通过非线性核函数扩展低秩分解和自适应双层稀疏分配机制，在减少内存使用的同时提升下游任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的稀疏调优方法存在两个问题：1) 两阶段方法在定位任务相关权重时忽略了微调过程中的参数调整，限制了性能；2) 稀疏梯度掩码导致高内存使用。

Method: 提出单阶段方法SNELLA：1) 通过两个低秩可学习矩阵的合并来选择性更新权重矩阵，引入非线性核函数防止权重更新间的相互依赖；2) 自适应双层稀疏分配机制，基于重要性分数在层间和层内进行端到端的权重竞争。

Result: 在分类、分割和生成任务上的实验表明，SNELLA在低内存使用下达到SOTA性能：在FGVC基准上比SPT-LoRA提高1.8% Top-1准确率；在86M到632M参数规模的模型上实现31.1%-39.9%的内存减少。

Conclusion: SNELLA通过创新的单阶段设计和自适应稀疏分配机制，有效解决了现有PEFT方法在性能和内存效率方面的限制，为参数高效微调提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) aims to adapt pre-trained vision
models to downstream tasks. Among PEFT paradigms, sparse tuning achieves
remarkable performance by adjusting only the weights most relevant to
downstream tasks, rather than densely tuning the entire weight matrix. Current
methods follow a two-stage paradigm. First, it locates task-relevant weights by
gradient information, which overlooks the parameter adjustments during
fine-tuning and limits the performance. Second, it updates only the located
weights by applying a sparse mask to the gradient of the weight matrix, which
results in high memory usage due to the storage of all weight matrices in the
optimizer. In this paper, we propose a one-stage method named SNELLA to
overcome the above limitations. For memory usage, SNELLA selectively updates
the weight matrix by adding it to another sparse matrix that is merged by two
low-rank learnable matrices. We extend the low-rank decomposition by
introducing nonlinear kernel functions, thereby increasing the rank of the
resulting merged matrix to prevent the interdependency among weight updates,
enabling better adaptation to downstream tasks. For locating task-relevant
weights, we propose an adaptive bi-level sparsity allocation mechanism that
encourages weights to compete across and inside layers based on their
importance scores in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments are conducted
on classification, segmentation, and generation tasks using different
pre-trained vision models. The results show that SNELLA achieves SOTA
performance with low memory usage. Notably, SNELLA obtains 1.8% (91.9% v.s.
90.1%) higher Top-1 accuracy on the FGVC benchmark compared to SPT-LoRA.
Compared to previous methods, SNELLA achieves a memory reduction of 31.1%-39.9%
across models with parameter scales from 86M to 632M. Our source codes are

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: COLA是一种基于最优传输的跨模态对齐框架，通过恢复特征空间的全局图像-文本对齐和局部结构一致性，有效解决CLIP模型在对抗攻击下的特征错位问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的方法主要关注对抗性微调或提示优化，但忽略了CLIP编码特征中的差距——文本和图像特征相距较远。这种错位在对抗性扰动下被显著放大，导致分类性能严重下降。

Method: COLA首先将对抗性图像嵌入投影到类别文本特征张成的子空间上，有效过滤非语义失真并保留判别信息；然后将图像和文本建模为多个增强视图上的离散分布，并通过最优传输细化它们的对齐，子空间投影无缝集成到成本计算中。

Result: 在14个零样本分类基准上的广泛评估证明了COLA的有效性，特别是在PGD对抗攻击下，在ImageNet及其变体上平均提升了6.7%，同时在干净样本上保持高准确率。

Conclusion: COLA是一种无需训练且与现有微调模型兼容的框架，能够在对抗条件下确保稳定的跨模态对齐，显著提升CLIP模型的对抗鲁棒性。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP demonstrate strong generalization
in zero-shot classification but remain highly vulnerable to adversarial
perturbations. Existing methods primarily focus on adversarial fine-tuning or
prompt optimization; they often overlook the gaps in CLIP's encoded features,
which is shown as the text and image features lie far apart from each other.
This misalignment is significantly amplified under adversarial perturbations,
leading to severe degradation in classification performance. To address this
problem, we propose Cross-modality Alignment, dubbed COLA, an optimal
transport-based framework that explicitly addresses adversarial misalignment by
restoring both global image-text alignment and local structural consistency in
the feature space. (1) COLA first projects adversarial image embeddings onto a
subspace spanned by class text features, effectively filtering out non-semantic
distortions while preserving discriminative information. (2) It then models
images and texts as discrete distributions over multiple augmented views and
refines their alignment via OT, with the subspace projection seamlessly
integrated into the cost computation. This design ensures stable cross-modal
alignment even under adversarial conditions. COLA is training-free and
compatible with existing fine-tuned models. Extensive evaluations across 14
zero-shot classification benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of COLA,
especially with an average improvement of 6.7% on ImageNet and its variants
under PGD adversarial attacks, while maintaining high accuracy on clean
samples.

TL;DR: 提出BOB方法解决T2I模型生成合成数据时的过拟合和多样性降低问题，通过提取类无关属性并在微调时显式条件化，在生成时边缘化这些属性，显著提升细粒度分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: T2I模型用于合成数据集生成时，使用少量真实样本微调会改善数据质量但可能导致过拟合和多样性降低，特别是在细粒度分类任务中。

Method: BOB方法：从少量真实样本中提取类无关属性（如场景背景、物体姿态），在T2I模型微调时显式条件化这些属性，在生成时边缘化它们，避免过拟合并保持生成先验。

Result: 在多个T2I模型、骨干网络和数据集上的实验显示，BOB在低样本细粒度分类中达到SOTA性能，在Aircraft数据集上比DataDream提升7.4%，在24个实验设置中18个优于先前方法，14个设置中准确率提升超过2%。

Conclusion: BOB方法通过显式条件化和边缘化类无关属性，有效缓解了T2I模型微调时的过拟合问题，为低样本细粒度分类提供了高质量的合成数据增强方案。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models are increasingly used for synthetic dataset
generation, but generating effective synthetic training data for classification
remains challenging. Fine-tuning a T2I model with a few real examples can help
improve the quality of synthetic training data; however, it may also cause
overfitting and reduce diversity in the generated samples. We propose a
fine-tuning strategy BOB (BeyondOBjects) to mitigate these concerns for
fine-grained classification. Given a small set of real examples, we first
extract class-agnostic attributes such as scene background and object pose. We
then explicitly condition on these attributes during fine-tuning of the T2I
model and marginalize them out during generation. This design mitigates
overfitting, preserves the T2I model's generative prior, reduces estimation
errors, and further minimizes unintended inter-class associations. Extensive
experiments across multiple T2I models, backbones, and datasets show that our
method achieves state-of-the-art performance in low-shot fine-grained
classification when augmented with synthetic data. Concretely, BOB outperforms
DataDream by 7.4% on the Aircraft dataset (from 50.0% to 57.4% when fine-tuning
a CLIP classifier with five real images augmented with 100 synthetic images).
In three of the four benchmarks, fine-tuning downstream models with 5 real
images augmented with BOB achieves better performance than fine-tuning with 10
real images. Collectively, BOB outperforms prior art in 18 of 24 experimental
settings, with 2+% accuracy improvements in 14 of these settings.

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion-based text synthesis have demonstrated
significant performance in inserting and editing text within images via
inpainting. However, despite the potential of text inpainting methods, three
key limitations hinder their applicability to broader Text Image Manipulation
(TIM) tasks: (i) the inability to remove text, (ii) the lack of control over
the style of rendered text, and (iii) a tendency to generate duplicated
letters. To address these challenges, we propose OmniText, a training-free
generalist capable of performing a wide range of TIM tasks. Specifically, we
investigate two key properties of cross- and self-attention mechanisms to
enable text removal and to provide control over both text styles and content.
Our findings reveal that text removal can be achieved by applying
self-attention inversion, which mitigates the model's tendency to focus on
surrounding text, thus reducing text hallucinations. Additionally, we
redistribute cross-attention, as increasing the probability of certain text
tokens reduces text hallucination. For controllable inpainting, we introduce
novel loss functions in a latent optimization framework: a cross-attention
content loss to improve text rendering accuracy and a self-attention style loss
to facilitate style customization. Furthermore, we present OmniText-Bench, a
benchmark dataset for evaluating diverse TIM tasks. It includes input images,
target text with masks, and style references, covering diverse applications
such as text removal, rescaling, repositioning, and insertion and editing with
various styles. Our OmniText framework is the first generalist method capable
of performing diverse TIM tasks. It achieves state-of-the-art performance
across multiple tasks and metrics compared to other text inpainting methods and
is comparable with specialist methods.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种评估预训练视觉模型表示可解释性的方法，发现分类性能与可解释性呈正相关，并展示了如何通过最大化可解释性来进一步提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练视觉模型在广泛应用中需要同时具备高分类性能和可解释性，但目前不清楚这两者是否能同时实现。

Method: 提出固有可解释性评分(IIS)，通过评估解释过程中的信息损失来量化表示的可解释性，并测量可解释语义的比例。

Result: 发现分类性能与可解释性呈正相关，高分类性能的表示包含更多可解释语义；通过可解释性最大化微调可进一步提升分类性能。

Conclusion: 实践者可以在预训练视觉模型中统一提升可解释性和分类性能，两者可以同时优化。

Abstract: The visual representation of a pre-trained model prioritizes the
classifiability on downstream tasks, while the widespread applications for
pre-trained visual models have posed new requirements for representation
interpretability. However, it remains unclear whether the pre-trained
representations can achieve high interpretability and classifiability
simultaneously. To answer this question, we quantify the representation
interpretability by leveraging its correlation with the ratio of interpretable
semantics within the representations. Given the pre-trained representations,
only the interpretable semantics can be captured by interpretations, whereas
the uninterpretable part leads to information loss. Based on this fact, we
propose the Inherent Interpretability Score (IIS) that evaluates the
information loss, measures the ratio of interpretable semantics, and quantifies
the representation interpretability. In the evaluation of the representation
interpretability with different classifiability, we surprisingly discover that
the interpretability and classifiability are positively correlated, i.e.,
representations with higher classifiability provide more interpretable
semantics that can be captured in the interpretations. This observation further
supports two benefits to the pre-trained representations. First, the
classifiability of representations can be further improved by fine-tuning with
interpretability maximization. Second, with the classifiability improvement for
the representations, we obtain predictions based on their interpretations with
less accuracy degradation. The discovered positive correlation and
corresponding applications show that practitioners can unify the improvements
in interpretability and classifiability for pre-trained vision models. Codes

Conclusion: UHKD是统一异构表示并有效利用视觉知识的有效方法，特别适用于异构模型间的知识蒸馏。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) is an effective model compression technique that
transfers knowledge from a high-performance teacher to a lightweight student,
reducing cost while maintaining accuracy. In visual applications, where
large-scale image models are widely used, KD enables efficient deployment.
However, architectural diversity introduces semantic discrepancies that hinder
the use of intermediate representations. Most existing KD methods are designed
for homogeneous models and degrade in heterogeneous scenarios, especially when
intermediate features are involved. Prior studies mainly focus on the logits
space, making limited use of the semantic information in intermediate layers.
To address this limitation, Unified Heterogeneous Knowledge Distillation (UHKD)
is proposed as a framework that leverages intermediate features in the
frequency domain for cross-architecture transfer. Fourier transform is applied
to capture global feature information, alleviating representational
discrepancies between heterogeneous teacher-student pairs. A Feature
Transformation Module (FTM) produces compact frequency-domain representations
of teacher features, while a learnable Feature Alignment Module (FAM) projects
student features and aligns them via multi-level matching. Training is guided
by a joint objective combining mean squared error on intermediate features with
Kullback-Leibler divergence on logits. Experiments on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1K
demonstrate gains of 5.59% and 0.83% over the latest method, highlighting UHKD
as an effective approach for unifying heterogeneous representations and
enabling efficient utilization of visual knowledge

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有狗运动数据集存在多视角和真实3D数据缺乏、规模小、多样性不足等局限性，限制了狗运动恢复研究的发展。

Method: 提出了一个三阶段实例特定优化流程，通过粗对齐、密集对应监督和时间正则化逐步优化SMAL模型的体型和姿态。

Result: 建立了四个运动恢复基准设置，支持单目和多视角、RGB和RGB-D输入的系统评估。

Conclusion: DogMo数据集和方法为狗运动恢复研究提供了理论基础，并在计算机视觉、计算机图形学和动物行为建模的交叉领域开辟了新方向。

Abstract: We present DogMo, a large-scale multi-view RGB-D video dataset capturing
diverse canine movements for the task of motion recovery from images. DogMo
comprises 1.2k motion sequences collected from 10 unique dogs, offering rich
variation in both motion and breed. It addresses key limitations of existing
dog motion datasets, including the lack of multi-view and real 3D data, as well
as limited scale and diversity. Leveraging DogMo, we establish four motion
recovery benchmark settings that support systematic evaluation across monocular
and multi-view, RGB and RGB-D inputs. To facilitate accurate motion recovery,
we further introduce a three-stage, instance-specific optimization pipeline
that fits the SMAL model to the motion sequences. Our method progressively
refines body shape and pose through coarse alignment, dense correspondence
supervision, and temporal regularization. Our dataset and method provide a
principled foundation for advancing research in dog motion recovery and open up
new directions at the intersection of computer vision, computer graphics, and
animal behavior modeling.

*Jiajian Xie,Hubery Yin,Chen Li,Zhou Zhao,Shengyu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ETC框架通过趋势一致性预测和模型特定误差容忍度搜索，在保持生成质量的同时实现2.65倍加速


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型虽然生成质量优秀，但受限于昂贵的迭代采样过程。现有训练自由方法通过重用模型输出来加速，但忽略了去噪趋势且缺乏误差控制，导致轨迹偏差和结果不一致

Method: 1) 引入一致性趋势预测器，利用扩散轨迹的平滑连续性，将历史去噪模式投影到稳定未来方向；2) 提出模型特定误差容忍度搜索机制，通过识别从语义规划到质量精炼的过渡点来推导校正阈值

Result: ETC在FLUX基础上实现2.65倍加速，一致性退化极小（-0.074 SSIM分数）

Conclusion: ETC框架有效解决了扩散模型加速中的轨迹偏差问题，在保持生成质量的同时显著提升采样效率

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable generative quality but remain
bottlenecked by costly iterative sampling. Recent training-free methods
accelerate diffusion process by reusing model outputs. However, these methods
ignore denoising trends and lack error control for model-specific tolerance,
leading to trajectory deviations under multi-step reuse and exacerbating
inconsistencies in the generated results. To address these issues, we introduce
Error-aware Trend Consistency (ETC), a framework that (1) introduces a
consistent trend predictor that leverages the smooth continuity of diffusion
trajectories, projecting historical denoising patterns into stable future
directions and progressively distributing them across multiple approximation
steps to achieve acceleration without deviating; (2) proposes a model-specific
error tolerance search mechanism that derives corrective thresholds by
identifying transition points from volatile semantic planning to stable quality
refinement. Experiments show that ETC achieves a 2.65x acceleration over FLUX
with negligible (-0.074 SSIM score) degradation of consistency.

Conclusion: 该训练免费框架有效提升了文本到图像生成的组合性和布局忠实度，代码已开源。

Abstract: Despite their impressive realism, modern text-to-image models still struggle
with compositionality, often failing to render accurate object counts,
attributes, and spatial relations. To address this challenge, we present a
training-free framework that combines an object-centric approach with
self-refinement to improve layout faithfulness while preserving aesthetic
quality. Specifically, we leverage large language models (LLMs) to synthesize
explicit layouts from input prompts, and we inject these layouts into the image
generation process, where a object-centric vision-language model (VLM) judge
reranks multiple candidates to select the most prompt-aligned outcome
iteratively. By unifying explicit layout-grounding with self-refine-based
inference-time scaling, our framework achieves stronger scene alignment with
prompts compared to recent text-to-image models. The code are available at

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-video (T2V) generation highlight the critical role
of high-quality video-text pairs in training models capable of producing
coherent and instruction-aligned videos. However, strategies for optimizing
video captions specifically for T2V training remain underexplored. In this
paper, we introduce VC4VG (Video Captioning for Video Generation), a
comprehensive caption optimization framework tailored to the needs of T2V
models.We begin by analyzing caption content from a T2V perspective,
decomposing the essential elements required for video reconstruction into
multiple dimensions, and proposing a principled caption design methodology. To
support evaluation, we construct VC4VG-Bench, a new benchmark featuring
fine-grained, multi-dimensional, and necessity-graded metrics aligned with
T2V-specific requirements.Extensive T2V fine-tuning experiments demonstrate a
strong correlation between improved caption quality and video generation
performance, validating the effectiveness of our approach. We release all

Abstract: This technical report presents our solution for the RoboSense Challenge at
IROS 2025, which evaluates Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on autonomous driving
scene understanding across perception, prediction, planning, and corruption
detection tasks. We propose a systematic framework built on four core
components. First, a Mixture-of-Prompts router classifies questions and
dispatches them to task-specific expert prompts, eliminating interference
across diverse question types. Second, task-specific prompts embed explicit
coordinate systems, spatial reasoning rules, role-playing,
Chain-of-Thought/Tree-of-Thought reasoning, and few-shot examples tailored to
each task. Third, a visual assembly module composes multi-view images with
object crops, magenta markers, and adaptive historical frames based on question
requirements. Fourth, we configure model inference parameters (temperature,
top-p, message roles) per task to optimize output quality. Implemented on
Qwen2.5-VL-72B, our approach achieves 70.87% average accuracy on Phase-1 (clean
data) and 72.85% on Phase-2 (corrupted data), demonstrating that structured

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel multi-object tracking (MOT) method, dubbed
GenTrack, whose main contributions include: a hybrid tracking approach
employing both stochastic and deterministic manners to robustly handle unknown
and time-varying numbers of targets, particularly in maintaining target
identity (ID) consistency and managing nonlinear dynamics, leveraging particle
swarm optimization (PSO) with some proposed fitness measures to guide
stochastic particles toward their target distribution modes, enabling effective
tracking even with weak and noisy object detectors, integration of social
interactions among targets to enhance PSO-guided particles as well as improve
continuous updates of both strong (matched) and weak (unmatched) tracks,
thereby reducing ID switches and track loss, especially during occlusions, a
GenTrack-based redefined visual MOT baseline incorporating a comprehensive
state and observation model based on space consistency, appearance, detection
confidence, track penalties, and social scores for systematic and efficient
target updates, and the first-ever publicly available source-code reference
implementation with minimal dependencies, featuring three variants, including
GenTrack Basic, PSO, and PSO-Social, facilitating flexible reimplementation.

Motivation: SAM2作为SAM的继任者，在视频分割方面表现出强大的泛化能力，但其对抗鲁棒性尚未被探索，现有对SAM的攻击方法是否能直接迁移到SAM2尚不明确。

Method: 设计了目标扫描策略将每帧划分为k个区域并随机分配提示，减少优化过程中的提示依赖性；提出双语义偏差框架，通过扭曲当前帧语义和破坏连续帧间语义一致性来优化UAP。

Result: 在六个数据集上的两个分割任务实验表明，UAP-SAM2显著优于现有最先进的攻击方法。

Conclusion: UAP-SAM2是首个针对SAM2的有效跨提示通用对抗攻击方法，解决了SAM2架构差异带来的挑战，在多个数据集上表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Recent studies reveal the vulnerability of the image segmentation foundation
model SAM to adversarial examples. Its successor, SAM2, has attracted
significant attention due to its strong generalization capability in video
segmentation. However, its robustness remains unexplored, and it is unclear
whether existing attacks on SAM can be directly transferred to SAM2. In this
paper, we first analyze the performance gap of existing attacks between SAM and
SAM2 and highlight two key challenges arising from their architectural
differences: directional guidance from the prompt and semantic entanglement
across consecutive frames. To address these issues, we propose UAP-SAM2, the
first cross-prompt universal adversarial attack against SAM2 driven by dual
semantic deviation. For cross-prompt transferability, we begin by designing a
target-scanning strategy that divides each frame into k regions, each randomly
assigned a prompt, to reduce prompt dependency during optimization. For
effectiveness, we design a dual semantic deviation framework that optimizes a
UAP by distorting the semantics within the current frame and disrupting the
semantic consistency across consecutive frames. Extensive experiments on six
datasets across two segmentation tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed method for SAM2. The comparative results show that UAP-SAM2
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) attacks by a large margin.

Abstract: This paper proposes a visual multi-object tracking method that jointly
employs stochastic and deterministic mechanisms to ensure identifier
consistency for unknown and time-varying target numbers under nonlinear
dynamics. A stochastic particle filter addresses nonlinear dynamics and
non-Gaussian noise, with support from particle swarm optimization (PSO) to
guide particles toward state distribution modes and mitigate divergence through
proposed fitness measures incorporating motion consistency, appearance
similarity, and social-interaction cues with neighboring targets. Deterministic
association further enforces identifier consistency via a proposed cost matrix
incorporating spatial consistency between particles and current detections,
detection confidences, and track penalties. Subsequently, a novel scheme is
proposed for the smooth updating of target states while preserving their
identities, particularly for weak tracks during interactions with other targets
and prolonged occlusions. Moreover, velocity regression over past states
provides trend-seed velocities, enhancing particle sampling and state updates.
The proposed tracker is designed to operate flexibly for both pre-recorded
videos and camera live streams, where future frames are unavailable.
Experimental results confirm superior performance compared to state-of-the-art
trackers. The source-code reference implementations of both the proposed method

Abstract: Accurate polyp and cardiac segmentation for early detection and treatment is
essential for the diagnosis and treatment planning of cancer-like diseases.
Traditional convolutional neural network (CNN) based models have represented
limited generalizability, robustness, and inability to handle uncertainty,
which affects the segmentation performance. To solve these problems, this paper
introduces CLFSeg, an encoder-decoder based framework that aggregates the
Fuzzy-Convolutional (FC) module leveraging convolutional layers and fuzzy
logic. This module enhances the segmentation performance by identifying local
and global features while minimizing the uncertainty, noise, and ambiguity in
boundary regions, ensuring computing efficiency. In order to handle class
imbalance problem while focusing on the areas of interest with tiny and
boundary regions, binary cross-entropy (BCE) with dice loss is incorporated.
Our proposed model exhibits exceptional performance on four publicly available

Extensive experiments and visual studies show CLFSeg surpasses the existing

Motivation: 自回归建模在视觉生成中推理速度慢，需要数千步生成单个样本，限制了实际应用。

Method: 提出基于耦合的信息论方法MC-SJD，通过最大化连续迭代中采样相同draft token的概率来加速标准SJD，只需对现有算法进行单行修改。

Result: 在图像生成中实现约4.2倍加速，视频生成中约13.3倍加速，且输出质量无损失。

Conclusion: MC-SJD有效解决了自回归视觉生成的推理速度瓶颈，为实际应用提供了可行的加速方案。

Abstract: While autoregressive (AR) modeling has recently emerged as a new paradigm in
visual generation, its practical adoption is severely constrained by the slow
inference speed of per-token generation, which often requires thousands of
steps to produce a single sample. To address this challenge, we propose MC-SJD,
a training-free, lossless parallel decoding framework designed to accelerate AR
visual generation by extending the recently introduced Speculative Jacobi
Decoding (SJD). Although SJD shows strong potential for accelerating AR
generation, we demonstrate that token instability across iterations
significantly reduces the acceptance rate, a limitation that primarily arises
from the independent sampling process used during draft token generation. To
overcome this, we introduce MC-SJD, an information-theoretic approach based on
coupling, which substantially accelerates standard SJD by maximizing the
probability of sampling identical draft tokens across consecutive iterations,
all while preserving its lossless property. Remarkably, this method requires
only a single-line modification to the existing algorithm, yet achieves
substantial performance gains, delivering up to a ~4.2x acceleration in image
generation and ~13.3x acceleration in video generation compared to standard AR
decoding, without any degradation in output quality.

Result: 实验表明ID²Face在视觉质量、身份抑制和效用保持方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 提出的训练中心框架有效解决了推理时干预的问题，实现了更好的身份匿名化效果。

Abstract: Face anonymization aims to conceal identity information while preserving
non-identity attributes. Mainstream diffusion models rely on inference-time
interventions such as negative guidance or energy-based optimization, which are
applied post-training to suppress identity features. These interventions often
introduce distribution shifts and entangle identity with non-identity
attributes, degrading visual fidelity and data utility. To address this, we
propose \textbf{ID\textsuperscript{2}Face}, a training-centric anonymization
framework that removes the need for inference-time optimization. The rationale
of our method is to learn a structured latent space where identity and
non-identity information are explicitly disentangled, enabling direct and
controllable anonymization at inference. To this end, we design a conditional
diffusion model with an identity-masked learning scheme. An Identity-Decoupled
Latent Recomposer uses an Identity Variational Autoencoder to model identity
features, while non-identity attributes are extracted from same-identity pairs
and aligned through bidirectional latent alignment. An Identity-Guided Latent
Harmonizer then fuses these representations via soft-gating conditioned on
noisy feature prediction. The model is trained with a recomposition-based
reconstruction loss to enforce disentanglement. At inference, anonymization is
achieved by sampling a random identity vector from the learned identity space.
To further suppress identity leakage, we introduce an Orthogonal Identity
Mapping strategy that enforces orthogonality between sampled and source
identity vectors. Experiments demonstrate that ID\textsuperscript{2}Face
outperforms existing methods in visual quality, identity suppression, and
utility preservation.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) typically process a large number of
visual tokens, leading to considerable computational overhead, even though many
of these tokens are redundant. Existing visual token pruning methods primarily
focus on selecting the most salient tokens based on attention scores, resulting
in the semantic incompleteness of the selected tokens. In this paper, we
propose a novel visual token pruning strategy, called
\textbf{S}aliency-\textbf{C}overage \textbf{O}riented token \textbf{P}runing
for \textbf{E}fficient MLLMs (SCOPE), to jointly model both the saliency and
coverage of the selected visual tokens to better preserve semantic
completeness. Specifically, we introduce a set-coverage for a given set of
selected tokens, computed based on the token relationships. We then define a
token-coverage gain for each unselected token, quantifying how much additional
coverage would be obtained by including it. By integrating the saliency score
into the token-coverage gain, we propose our SCOPE score and iteratively select
the token with the highest SCOPE score. We conduct extensive experiments on
multiple vision-language understanding benchmarks using the LLaVA-1.5 and
LLaVA-Next models. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
consistently outperforms prior approaches. Our code is available at

Abstract: Microsaccades are small, involuntary eye movements vital for visual
perception and neural processing. Traditional microsaccade studies typically
use eye trackers or frame-based analysis, which, while precise, are costly and
limited in scalability and temporal resolution. Event-based sensing offers a
high-speed, low-latency alternative by capturing fine-grained spatiotemporal
changes efficiently. This work introduces a pioneering event-based microsaccade
dataset to support research on small eye movement dynamics in cognitive
computing. Using Blender, we render high-fidelity eye movement scenarios and
simulate microsaccades with angular displacements from 0.5 to 2.0 degrees,
divided into seven distinct classes. These are converted to event streams using
v2e, preserving the natural temporal dynamics of microsaccades, with durations
ranging from 0.25 ms to 2.25 ms. We evaluate the dataset using Spiking-VGG11,
Spiking-VGG13, and Spiking-VGG16, and propose Spiking-VGG16Flow, an
optical-flow-enhanced variant implemented in SpikingJelly. The models achieve
around 90 percent average accuracy, successfully classifying microsaccades by
angular displacement, independent of event count or duration. These results
demonstrate the potential of spiking neural networks for fine motion
recognition and establish a benchmark for event-based vision research. The
dataset, code, and trained models will be publicly available at

Result: 在雾霾和低光照基准测试上的广泛实验表明，LR-YOLO持续提高了检测稳定性、优化平滑度和整体准确率。

Conclusion: LROD框架通过协调恢复和检测任务的Lipschitz连续性，有效解决了传统级联框架中的不稳定问题，为恶劣条件下的目标检测提供了更稳健的解决方案。

Abstract: To improve detection robustness in adverse conditions (e.g., haze and low
light), image restoration is commonly applied as a pre-processing step to
enhance image quality for the detector. However, the functional mismatch
between restoration and detection networks can introduce instability and hinder
effective integration -- an issue that remains underexplored. We revisit this
limitation through the lens of Lipschitz continuity, analyzing the functional
differences between restoration and detection networks in both the input space
and the parameter space. Our analysis shows that restoration networks perform
smooth, continuous transformations, while object detectors operate with
discontinuous decision boundaries, making them highly sensitive to minor
perturbations. This mismatch introduces instability in traditional cascade
frameworks, where even imperceptible noise from restoration is amplified during
detection, disrupting gradient flow and hindering optimization. To address
this, we propose Lipschitz-regularized object detection (LROD), a simple yet
effective framework that integrates image restoration directly into the
detector's feature learning, harmonizing the Lipschitz continuity of both tasks
during training. We implement this framework as Lipschitz-regularized YOLO
(LR-YOLO), extending seamlessly to existing YOLO detectors. Extensive
experiments on haze and low-light benchmarks demonstrate that LR-YOLO
consistently improves detection stability, optimization smoothness, and overall
accuracy.

Conclusion: 通过将序列建模适应阴影去除的结构完整性和色彩一致性要求，该方法能有效去除阴影并保持图像质量。

Abstract: Recent deep models for image shadow removal often rely on attention-based
architectures to capture long-range dependencies. However, their fixed
attention patterns tend to mix illumination cues from irrelevant regions,
leading to distorted structures and inconsistent colors. In this work, we
revisit shadow removal from a sequence modeling perspective and explore the use
of Mamba, a selective state space model that propagates global context through
directional state transitions. These transitions yield an efficient global
receptive field while preserving positional continuity. Despite its potential,
directly applying Mamba to image data is suboptimal, since it lacks awareness
of shadow-non-shadow semantics and remains susceptible to color interference
from nearby regions. To address these limitations, we propose CrossGate, a
directional modulation mechanism that injects shadow-aware similarity into
Mamba's input gate, allowing selective integration of relevant context along
transition axes. To further ensure appearance fidelity, we introduce ColorShift
regularization, a contrastive learning objective driven by global color
statistics. By synthesizing structured informative negatives, it guides the
model to suppress color contamination and achieve robust color restoration.
Together, these components adapt sequence modeling to the structural integrity
and chromatic consistency required for shadow removal. Extensive experiments on
public benchmarks demonstrate that DeshadowMamba achieves state-of-the-art
visual quality and strong quantitative performance.

TL;DR: 提出UtilGen框架，通过下游任务反馈自适应优化数据生成过程，生成任务特定的高效用训练数据，相比现有方法平均准确率提升3.87%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据增强方法主要关注数据的内在属性（如保真度和多样性），而忽略了任务特定需求。不同任务和网络架构对训练数据的要求差异很大，需要数据生成器考虑下游任务需求。

Method: 引入权重分配网络评估每个合成样本的任务特定效用，采用双层优化策略：模型级优化定制生成模型以适应下游任务，实例级优化在每轮生成中调整生成策略（如提示嵌入和初始噪声）。

Result: 在8个不同复杂度和粒度的基准数据集上，UtilGen始终实现优越性能，平均准确率比现有最佳方法提高3.87%。数据影响和分布分析表明，UtilGen生成更具影响力和任务相关性的合成数据。

Conclusion: UtilGen验证了从视觉特征中心到任务效用中心的数据增强范式转变的有效性，能够生成更高质量的任务特定训练数据。

Abstract: Data augmentation using generative models has emerged as a powerful paradigm
for enhancing performance in computer vision tasks. However, most existing
augmentation approaches primarily focus on optimizing intrinsic data attributes
-- such as fidelity and diversity -- to generate visually high-quality
synthetic data, while often neglecting task-specific requirements. Yet, it is
essential for data generators to account for the needs of downstream tasks, as
training data requirements can vary significantly across different tasks and
network architectures. To address these limitations, we propose UtilGen, a
novel utility-centric data augmentation framework that adaptively optimizes the
data generation process to produce task-specific, high-utility training data
via downstream task feedback. Specifically, we first introduce a weight
allocation network to evaluate the task-specific utility of each synthetic
sample. Guided by these evaluations, UtilGen iteratively refines the data
generation process using a dual-level optimization strategy to maximize the
synthetic data utility: (1) model-level optimization tailors the generative
model to the downstream task, and (2) instance-level optimization adjusts
generation policies -- such as prompt embeddings and initial noise -- at each
generation round. Extensive experiments on eight benchmark datasets of varying
complexity and granularity demonstrate that UtilGen consistently achieves
superior performance, with an average accuracy improvement of 3.87% over
previous SOTA. Further analysis of data influence and distribution reveals that
UtilGen produces more impactful and task-relevant synthetic data, validating
the effectiveness of the paradigm shift from visual characteristics-centric to
task utility-centric data augmentation.

Motivation: 合成图像来源归因在数据稀缺条件下具有挑战性，需要少样本或零样本分类能力。

Method: 基于图像重合成的免训练单样本归因方法：生成图像描述提示词，用所有候选源模型重合成图像，在特征空间中选择与原图最接近的重合成图像进行归因。

Result: 提出的重合成方法在仅有少量训练样本时优于现有技术，新数据集为开发评估少样本和零样本方法提供了有价值的基准。

Conclusion: 基于重合成的方法在数据稀缺条件下表现优异，新数据集为合成图像归因研究提供了具有挑战性的基准。

Abstract: Synthetic image source attribution is a challenging task, especially in data
scarcity conditions requiring few-shot or zero-shot classification
capabilities. We present a new training-free one-shot attribution method based
on image resynthesis. A prompt describing the image under analysis is
generated, then it is used to resynthesize the image with all the candidate
sources. The image is attributed to the model which produced the resynthesis
closest to the original image in a proper feature space. We also introduce a
new dataset for synthetic image attribution consisting of face images from
commercial and open-source text-to-image generators. The dataset provides a
challenging attribution framework, useful for developing new attribution models
and testing their capabilities on different generative architectures. The
dataset structure allows to test approaches based on resynthesis and to compare
them to few-shot methods. Results from state-of-the-art few-shot approaches and
other baselines show that the proposed resynthesis method outperforms existing
techniques when only a few samples are available for training or fine-tuning.
The experiments also demonstrate that the new dataset is a challenging one and
represents a valuable benchmark for developing and evaluating future few-shot
and zero-shot methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在局限性：监督微调会损害通用能力，强化微调偏向文本推理而非视觉感知，且高质量数据稀缺

Method: 设计两阶段任务，将视觉感知学习构建为从粗到细的渐进过程；开发自举框架ViPER，通过自批判和自预测实现迭代进化；整合图像级和实例级重建与两阶段强化学习策略

Result: 在Qwen2.5-VL系列上应用ViPER得到Qwen-Viper系列，在7个综合基准上平均提升1.7%，细粒度感知任务上最高提升6.0%，在各种视觉语言场景中表现优越且保持通用性

Conclusion: ViPER不仅实现了感知能力的自我提升，还为生成与理解之间的互惠关系提供了具体证据，是开发更自主、更强大VLMs的突破

Abstract: The limited capacity for fine-grained visual perception presents a critical
bottleneck for Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in real-world applications.
Addressing this is challenging due to the scarcity of high-quality data and the
limitations of existing methods: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) often compromises
general capabilities, while reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) prioritizes textual
reasoning over visual perception. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel
two-stage task that structures visual perception learning as a coarse-to-fine
progressive process. Based on this task formulation, we develop ViPER, a
self-bootstrapping framework specifically designed to enable iterative
evolution through self-critiquing and self-prediction. By synergistically
integrating image-level and instance-level reconstruction with a two-stage
reinforcement learning strategy, ViPER establishes a closed-loop training
paradigm, where internally synthesized data directly fuel the enhancement of
perceptual ability. Applied to the Qwen2.5-VL family, ViPER produces the
Qwen-Viper series. With an average gain of 1.7% on seven comprehensive
benchmarks spanning various tasks and up to 6.0% on fine-grained perception,
Qwen-Viper consistently demonstrates superior performance across different
vision-language scenarios while maintaining generalizability. Beyond enabling
self-improvement in perceptual capabilities, ViPER provides concrete evidence
for the reciprocal relationship between generation and understanding, a
breakthrough to developing more autonomous and capable VLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 遥感应用中深度学习性能受限于标注数据稀缺和跨域标注成本高，而现有视觉语言模型如CLIP在遥感领域存在显著领域差距和任务特定语义适应需求。

Method: 评估了四种代表性提示学习方法：上下文优化、条件上下文优化、多模态提示学习和自约束提示学习，这些方法体现了从静态优化到条件提示、多模态适应和语义正则化的互补设计理念。

Result: 在多个遥感基准数据集上的实验表明，提示学习方法在少样本场景下始终优于两种基线方法，特别是自约束提示学习在跨域性能上表现最稳健。

Conclusion: 提示学习是连接卫星和航空影像领域差距的可扩展高效解决方案，为未来研究提供了坚实基础。

Abstract: Remote sensing applications increasingly rely on deep learning for scene
classification. However, their performance is often constrained by the scarcity
of labeled data and the high cost of annotation across diverse geographic and
sensor domains. While recent vision-language models like CLIP have shown
promise by learning transferable representations at scale by aligning visual
and textual modalities, their direct application to remote sensing remains
suboptimal due to significant domain gaps and the need for task-specific
semantic adaptation. To address this critical challenge, we systematically
explore prompt learning as a lightweight and efficient adaptation strategy for
few-shot remote sensing image scene classification. We evaluate several
representative methods, including Context Optimization, Conditional Context
Optimization, Multi-modal Prompt Learning, and Prompting with Self-Regulating
Constraints. These approaches reflect complementary design philosophies: from
static context optimization to conditional prompts for enhanced generalization,
multi-modal prompts for joint vision-language adaptation, and semantically
regularized prompts for stable learning without forgetting. We benchmark these
prompt-learning methods against two standard baselines: zero-shot CLIP with
hand-crafted prompts and a linear probe trained on frozen CLIP features.
Through extensive experiments on multiple benchmark remote sensing datasets,
including cross-dataset generalization tests, we demonstrate that prompt
learning consistently outperforms both baselines in few-shot scenarios.
Notably, Prompting with Self-Regulating Constraints achieves the most robust
cross-domain performance. Our findings underscore prompt learning as a scalable
and efficient solution for bridging the domain gap in satellite and aerial
imagery, providing a strong foundation for future research in this field.

Abstract: Teacher-student frameworks have emerged as a leading approach in
semi-supervised medical image segmentation, demonstrating strong performance
across various tasks. However, the learning effects are still limited by the
strong correlation and unreliable knowledge transfer process between teacher

switching Dual-Student architecture that strategically selects the most
reliable student at each iteration to enhance dual-student collaboration and
prevent error reinforcement. We also introduce a strategy of Loss-Aware
Exponential Moving Average to dynamically ensure that the teacher absorbs
meaningful information from students, improving the quality of pseudo-labels.
Our plug-and-play framework is extensively evaluated on 3D medical image
segmentation datasets, where it outperforms state-of-the-art semi-supervised

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: W2-Net通过双查询机制解决指代表达式计数问题，将问题解耦为"计数什么"和"在哪里看"，显著提升了子类级别的对象计数性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的指代表达式计数方法存在根本性挑战：标注点通常放置在类别代表性位置（如头部），迫使模型关注类别级特征而忽略其他视觉区域（如腿部）的属性信息。

Method: 提出W2-Net框架，采用双查询机制：标准w2c查询用于定位对象，专用w2s查询用于从属性特定视觉区域提取特征。还引入了子类可分离匹配策略，通过排斥力增强子类间可分离性。

Result: 在REC-8K数据集上显著优于现有技术，计数误差降低22.5%（验证集）和18.0%（测试集），定位F1分数分别提高7%和8%。

Conclusion: W2-Net通过明确解耦"计数什么"和"在哪里看"，有效解决了指代表达式计数中的属性信息利用问题，为细粒度子类计数提供了新思路。

Abstract: Referring Expression Counting (REC) extends class-level object counting to
the fine-grained subclass-level, aiming to enumerate objects matching a textual
expression that specifies both the class and distinguishing attribute. A
fundamental challenge, however, has been overlooked: annotation points are
typically placed on class-representative locations (e.g., heads), forcing
models to focus on class-level features while neglecting attribute information
from other visual regions (e.g., legs for "walking"). To address this, we
propose W2-Net, a novel framework that explicitly decouples the problem into
"what to count" and "where to see" via a dual-query mechanism. Specifically,
alongside the standard what-to-count (w2c) queries that localize the object, we
introduce dedicated where-to-see (w2s) queries. The w2s queries are guided to
seek and extract features from attribute-specific visual regions, enabling
precise subclass discrimination. Furthermore, we introduce Subclass Separable
Matching (SSM), a novel matching strategy that incorporates a repulsive force
to enhance inter-subclass separability during label assignment. W2-Net
significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art on the REC-8K dataset, reducing
counting error by 22.5% (validation) and 18.0% (test), and improving
localization F1 by 7% and 8%, respectively. Code will be available.

Motivation: 现有深度学习框架（如nnU-Net）在脑卒中病灶分割中表现出色，但由于依赖复杂和整体化设计，难以在临床环境中部署使用。

Method: 采用模块化设计，将预处理、推理和后处理解耦：预处理使用Anima工具箱生成BIDS兼容输出，推理使用ONNX Runtime和Float16量化（模型大小减少约50%），提供图形界面和命令行界面。

Result: 在300名亚急性和慢性卒中患者的测试集上，分割性能与原始PyTorch流水线相当（Dice差异小于10^-3）。

Conclusion: 高性能研究流水线可以成功转化为便携、临床可用的工具，证明了研究到临床转化的可行性。

Abstract: Deep learning frameworks such as nnU-Net achieve state-of-the-art performance
in brain lesion segmentation but remain difficult to deploy clinically due to
heavy dependencies and monolithic design. We introduce \textit{StrokeSeg}, a
modular and lightweight framework that translates research-grade stroke lesion
segmentation models into deployable applications. Preprocessing, inference, and
postprocessing are decoupled: preprocessing relies on the Anima toolbox with
BIDS-compliant outputs, and inference uses ONNX Runtime with \texttt{Float16}
quantisation, reducing model size by about 50\%. \textit{StrokeSeg} provides
both graphical and command-line interfaces and is distributed as Python scripts
and as a standalone Windows executable. On a held-out set of 300 sub-acute and
chronic stroke subjects, segmentation performance was equivalent to the
original PyTorch pipeline (Dice difference $<10^{-3}$), demonstrating that
high-performing research pipelines can be transformed into portable, clinically
usable tools.

Motivation: 偏振图像融合结合S0和DOLP图像通过互补纹理特征揭示表面粗糙度和材料特性，在伪装识别、组织病理分析、表面缺陷检测等领域有重要应用。需要解决复杂光照环境下不同偏振图像的互补信息整合问题。

Conclusion: MLSN网络有效解决了偏振图像融合中的对比度差异和复杂光照适应问题，提出的MSP数据集填补了高质量偏振图像融合数据集的空白，为相关应用提供了有力支持。

Abstract: Polarization image fusion combines S0 and DOLP images to reveal surface
roughness and material properties through complementary texture features, which
has important applications in camouflage recognition, tissue pathology
analysis, surface defect detection and other fields. To intergrate
coL-Splementary information from different polarized images in complex
luminance environment, we propose a luminance-aware multi-scale network (MLSN).
In the encoder stage, we propose a multi-scale spatial weight matrix through a
brightness-branch , which dynamically weighted inject the luminance into the
feature maps, solving the problem of inherent contrast difference in polarized
images. The global-local feature fusion mechanism is designed at the bottleneck
layer to perform windowed self-attention computation, to balance the global
context and local details through residual linking in the feature dimension
restructuring stage. In the decoder stage, to further improve the adaptability
to complex lighting, we propose a Brightness-Enhancement module, establishing
the mapping relationship between luminance distribution and texture features,
realizing the nonlinear luminance correction of the fusion result. We also
present MSP, an 1000 pairs of polarized images that covers 17 types of indoor
and outdoor complex lighting scenes. MSP provides four-direction polarization
raw maps, solving the scarcity of high-quality datasets in polarization image
fusion. Extensive experiment on MSP, PIF and GAND datasets verify that the
proposed MLSN outperms the state-of-the-art methods in subjective and objective
evaluations, and the MS-SSIM and SD metircs are higher than the average values
of other methods by 8.57%, 60.64%, 10.26%, 63.53%, 22.21%, and 54.31%,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像通常配有包含专家注释的放射学报告，但依赖这些报告进行临床预测需要放射科医生的及时手动工作。研究旨在探索何时以及如何在训练中利用放射学报告来改进仅基于图像的分类。

Method: 系统研究了放射学报告在预训练和微调阶段的使用，涵盖诊断和预后任务（如12个月再入院），并在不同训练集规模下进行评估。

Result: 发现：（1）当标签与文本强相关时，在预训练阶段利用报告有益；但当标签与文本弱相关时，通过显式图像-文本对齐进行预训练可能有害；（2）在微调阶段使用报告能带来显著改进，在某些情况下影响甚至超过预训练方法。

Conclusion: 研究为如何利用特权文本数据训练医学图像分类器提供了可操作的见解，同时指出了当前研究中的空白。

Abstract: Medical images used to train machine learning models are often accompanied by
radiology reports containing rich expert annotations. However, relying on these
reports as inputs for clinical prediction requires the timely manual work of a
trained radiologist. This raises a natural question: when can radiology reports
be leveraged during training to improve image-only classification? Prior works
are limited to evaluating pre-trained image representations by fine-tuning them
to predict diagnostic labels, often extracted from reports, ignoring tasks with
labels that are weakly associated with the text. To address this gap, we
conduct a systematic study of how radiology reports can be used during both
pre-training and fine-tuning, across diagnostic and prognostic tasks (e.g.,
12-month readmission), and under varying training set sizes. Our findings
reveal that: (1) Leveraging reports during pre-training is beneficial for
downstream classification tasks where the label is well-represented in the
text; however, pre-training through explicit image-text alignment can be
detrimental in settings where it's not; (2) Fine-tuning with reports can lead
to significant improvements and even have a larger impact than the pre-training
method in certain settings. These results provide actionable insights into when
and how to leverage privileged text data to train medical image classifiers
while highlighting gaps in current research.

Motivation: 卒中后MRI显示的结构变化（如萎缩和脑室扩大）是恢复和预后的影像生物标志物，但监督分割方法难以有效捕捉这些异常

Method: 使用基于流的生成模型REFLECT进行无监督异常检测，在ATLAS数据集上使用双专家中心切片标注，通过自由响应ROC分析评估异常图性能，比较在卒中患者无病灶切片和健康对照数据上训练的模型

Result: 在ATLAS测试对象上，使用健康对照数据训练的模型在病灶分割（Dice = 0.37 vs 0.27）和非病灶异常检测敏感性（FROC = 0.62 vs 0.43）方面表现更优

Conclusion: 在完全健康解剖结构上训练能更好地建模正常变异性，从而实现更广泛和可靠的结构异常检测

Abstract: Post-stroke MRI not only delineates focal lesions but also reveals secondary
structural changes, such as atrophy and ventricular enlargement. These
abnormalities, increasingly recognised as imaging biomarkers of recovery and
outcome, remain poorly captured by supervised segmentation methods. We evaluate
REFLECT, a flow-based generative model, for unsupervised detection of both
focal and non-lesional abnormalities in post-stroke patients. Using dual-expert
central-slice annotations on ATLAS data, performance was assessed at the object
level with Free-Response ROC analysis for anomaly maps. Two models were trained
on lesion-free slices from stroke patients (ATLAS) and on healthy controls
(IXI) to test the effect of training data. On ATLAS test subjects, the
IXI-trained model achieved higher lesion segmentation (Dice = 0.37 vs 0.27) and
improved sensitivity to non-lesional abnormalities (FROC = 0.62 vs 0.43).
Training on fully healthy anatomy improves the modelling of normal variability,
enabling broader and more reliable detection of structural abnormalities.

Abstract: The sustainable management of the Qaraaoun Reservoir, the largest surface
water body in Lebanon located in the Bekaa Plain, depends on reliable
monitoring of its storage volume despite frequent sensor malfunctions and
limited maintenance capacity. This study introduces a sensor-free approach that
integrates open-source satellite imagery, advanced water-extent segmentation,
and machine learning to estimate the reservoir surface area and volume in near
real time. Sentinel-2 and Landsat images are processed, where surface water is
delineated using a newly proposed water segmentation index. A machine learning
model based on Support Vector Regression (SVR) is trained on a curated dataset
that includes water surface area, water level, and water volume calculations
using a reservoir bathymetry survey. The model is then able to estimate
reservoir volume relying solely on surface area extracted from satellite
imagery, without the need for ground measurements. Water segmentation using the
proposed index aligns with ground truth for more than 95 percent of the
shoreline. Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV yields an optimized SVR
performance with error under 1.5 percent of full reservoir capacity and
coefficients of determination exceeding 0.98. These results demonstrate the

TL;DR: 提出了一个专门用于评估语义分割中可解释AI方法的系统性框架，考虑了空间和上下文任务复杂性，使用像素级评估策略和精心设计的指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI模型在安全关键领域的应用增加，确保透明度和可信度至关重要。虽然分类任务的可解释AI评估已有进展，但语义分割的评估策略相对不足。

Method: 开发了一个全面的评估框架，专门针对语义分割中的可解释AI方法，采用像素级评估策略和精心设计的指标来提供细粒度的可解释性洞察。

Result: 使用最近改编的类激活映射XAI方案的模拟结果证明了所提出方法的高效性、鲁棒性和可靠性。

Conclusion: 这些发现有助于推进透明、可信和可问责的语义分割模型的发展。

Abstract: Ensuring transparency and trust in artificial intelligence (AI) models is
essential, particularly as they are increasingly applied in safety-critical and
high-stakes domains. Explainable AI (XAI) has emerged as a promising approach
to address this challenge, yet the rigorous evaluation of XAI methods remains
crucial for optimizing the trade-offs between model complexity, predictive
performance, and interpretability. While extensive progress has been achieved
in evaluating XAI techniques for classification tasks, evaluation strategies
tailored to semantic segmentation remain relatively underexplored. This work
introduces a comprehensive and systematic evaluation framework specifically
designed for assessing XAI in semantic segmentation, explicitly accounting for
both spatial and contextual task complexities. The framework employs
pixel-level evaluation strategies and carefully designed metrics to provide
fine-grained interpretability insights. Simulation results using recently
adapted class activation mapping (CAM)-based XAI schemes demonstrate the
efficiency, robustness, and reliability of the proposed methodology. These
findings contribute to advancing transparent, trustworthy, and accountable
semantic segmentation models.

*Zhineng Zhao,Zhihai He,Zikun Zhou,Siwei Ma,Yaowei Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种基于功能分解的深度条件图像压缩框架DCIC-sgp，通过自生成先验来分离图像的结构骨架和纹理细节，有效缓解低码率下的几何变形问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前学习型图像压缩方法难以建模自然图像中复杂的相关性结构，特别是全局结构与局部纹理的纠缠问题，导致低码率下出现严重几何变形。

Method: 首先编码自生成先验来捕捉图像结构骨架，然后利用该先验全面调制整个压缩流程，特别是分析变换，使其专注于残差的高熵细节，实现信息流解耦。

Result: 视觉分析显示显著减轻了传统编解码器在低码率下的几何变形伪影；量化评估在Kodak、CLIC和Tecnick数据集上相对VTM-12.1分别实现了14.4%、15.7%和15.1%的BD-rate降低。

Conclusion: 提出的深度条件图像压缩框架通过功能分解和自生成先验有效解耦信息流，在保持高率失真性能的同时显著改善了低码率下的视觉质量。

Abstract: Learned image compression (LIC) has shown great promise for achieving high
rate-distortion performance. However, current LIC methods are often limited in
their capability to model the complex correlation structures inherent in
natural images, particularly the entanglement of invariant global structures
with transient local textures within a single monolithic representation. This
limitation precipitates severe geometric deformation at low bitrates. To
address this, we introduce a framework predicated on functional decomposition,
which we term Deeply-Conditioned Image Compression via self-generated priors
(DCIC-sgp). Our central idea is to first encode a potent, self-generated prior
to encapsulate the image's structural backbone. This prior is subsequently
utilized not as mere side-information, but to holistically modulate the entire
compression pipeline. This deep conditioning, most critically of the analysis
transform, liberates it to dedicate its representational capacity to the
residual, high-entropy details. This hierarchical, dependency-driven approach
achieves an effective disentanglement of information streams. Our extensive
experiments validate this assertion; visual analysis demonstrates that our
method substantially mitigates the geometric deformation artifacts that plague
conventional codecs at low bitrates. Quantitatively, our framework establishes
highly competitive performance, achieving significant BD-rate reductions of
14.4%, 15.7%, and 15.1% against the VVC test model VTM-12.1 on the Kodak, CLIC,
and Tecnick datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 视频扩散模型(VDMs)相比大型语言模型(LLMs)在视觉领域展现出更强的数据效率和组合理解能力，通过时空数据预训练获得了更好的归纳偏置。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在语言领域取得了显著成功，但在视觉领域仍然面临组合理解、样本效率和通用问题解决能力的挑战，需要寻找更好的视觉基础模型方向。

Method: 使用预训练的视频扩散模型(VDMs)和大型语言模型(LLMs)，配备轻量级适配器，在自然模态下进行任务评估，包括ARC-AGI、ConceptARC、视觉游戏、路径规划和元胞自动机等基准测试。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，视频扩散模型比语言模型表现出更高的数据效率，证明了视频预训练提供的归纳偏置对视觉基础模型发展的价值。

Conclusion: 视频预训练为视觉基础模型提供了有益的归纳偏置，是推进视觉智能发展的有前景方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated that large-scale pretraining
enables systems to adapt rapidly to new problems with little supervision in the
language domain. This success, however, has not translated as effectively to
the visual domain, where models, including LLMs, continue to struggle with
compositional understanding, sample efficiency, and general-purpose
problem-solving. We investigate Video Diffusion Models (VDMs) as a promising
direction for bridging this gap. Pretraining on spatiotemporal data endows
these models with strong inductive biases for structure and dynamics, which we
hypothesize can support broad task adaptability. To test this, we design a
controlled evaluation in which both a pretrained LLM and a pretrained VDM are
equipped with lightweight adapters and presented with tasks in their natural
modalities. Across benchmarks including ARC-AGI, ConceptARC, visual games,
route planning, and cellular automata, VDMs demonstrate higher data efficiency
than their language counterparts. Taken together, our results indicate that
video pretraining offers inductive biases that support progress toward visual
foundation models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Kineo是一个完全自动化的无标定多视角运动捕捉系统，使用未同步、未标定的消费级RGB相机视频，通过2D关键点同时标定相机和重建3D关键点，大幅提升了无标定方法的精度和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的无标定多视角运动捕捉方法虽然降低了对精确相机标定的要求，但存在计算成本高和重建精度低的问题，限制了非专家用户和野外场景的应用。

Method: 利用现成的2D关键点检测器，结合置信度驱动的时空关键点采样策略和图优化方法，同时标定相机（包括畸变系数）并重建3D关键点和密集场景点云，计算成本与序列长度无关。

Result: 在EgoHumans和Human3.6M数据集上评估，相比现有方法，相机平移误差降低83-85%，相机角度误差降低86-92%，世界平均关节误差降低83-91%。处理效率高，特定配置下36分钟可处理80分钟视频。

Conclusion: Kineo显著提升了无标定运动捕捉的性能和实用性，为广泛的实际应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Markerless multiview motion capture is often constrained by the need for
precise camera calibration, limiting accessibility for non-experts and
in-the-wild captures. Existing calibration-free approaches mitigate this
requirement but suffer from high computational cost and reduced reconstruction
accuracy.
  We present Kineo, a fully automatic, calibration-free pipeline for markerless
motion capture from videos captured by unsynchronized, uncalibrated,
consumer-grade RGB cameras. Kineo leverages 2D keypoints from off-the-shelf
detectors to simultaneously calibrate cameras, including Brown-Conrady
distortion coefficients, and reconstruct 3D keypoints and dense scene point
maps at metric scale. A confidence-driven spatio-temporal keypoint sampling
strategy, combined with graph-based global optimization, ensures robust
calibration at a fixed computational cost independent of sequence length. We
further introduce a pairwise reprojection consensus score to quantify 3D
reconstruction reliability for downstream tasks.
  Evaluations on EgoHumans and Human3.6M demonstrate substantial improvements
over prior calibration-free methods. Compared to previous state-of-the-art
approaches, Kineo reduces camera translation error by approximately 83-85%,
camera angular error by 86-92%, and world mean-per-joint error (W-MPJPE) by
83-91%.
  Kineo is also efficient in real-world scenarios, processing multi-view
sequences faster than their duration in specific configuration (e.g., 36min to
process 1h20min of footage). The full pipeline and evaluation code are openly
released to promote reproducibility and practical adoption at

TL;DR: 提出Decoupled MeanFlow方法，将流模型转换为流映射模型，无需架构修改即可实现1-4步高质量生成，在ImageNet上取得SOTA结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 去噪生成模型需要大量去噪步骤，流映射可减少离散化误差并加速采样，但现有方法需要架构修改且与预训练模型不兼容。

Method: 通过条件化扩散变换器的最终块到后续时间步，将预训练流模型直接转换为流映射模型，结合增强训练技术。

Result: 在ImageNet 256x256和512x512上，1步FID分别为2.16和2.12，4步FID分别为1.51和1.68，推理速度提升100倍以上。

Conclusion: 训练流模型后转换为流映射比从头训练更高效有效，实现了接近流模型性能的极速生成。

Abstract: Denoising generative models, such as diffusion and flow-based models, produce
high-quality samples but require many denoising steps due to discretization
error. Flow maps, which estimate the average velocity between timesteps,
mitigate this error and enable faster sampling. However, their training
typically demands architectural changes that limit compatibility with
pretrained flow models. We introduce Decoupled MeanFlow, a simple decoding
strategy that converts flow models into flow map models without architectural
modifications. Our method conditions the final blocks of diffusion transformers
on the subsequent timestep, allowing pretrained flow models to be directly
repurposed as flow maps. Combined with enhanced training techniques, this
design enables high-quality generation in as few as 1 to 4 steps. Notably, we
find that training flow models and subsequently converting them is more
efficient and effective than training flow maps from scratch. On ImageNet
256x256 and 512x512, our models attain 1-step FID of 2.16 and 2.12,
respectively, surpassing prior art by a large margin. Furthermore, we achieve
FID of 1.51 and 1.68 when increasing the steps to 4, which nearly matches the
performance of flow models while delivering over 100x faster inference.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出DisK-NeuralRTI方法，通过知识蒸馏降低NeuralRTI的计算成本，解决传统RTI方法在复杂反射场建模中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RTI方法（如PTM和HSH）使用固定基函数和少量像素系数，难以准确捕捉复杂反射场，在强反射或阴影区域会产生伪影。NeuralRTI虽然质量更好，但解码网络参数多、计算成本高，在有限硬件上无法实现全分辨率渲染。

Method: 基于知识蒸馏（Knowledge Distillation）的新解决方案，通过训练更小的网络来降低NeuralRTI的计算成本，同时保持渲染质量。

Result: DisK-NeuralRTI能够显著降低计算成本，使NeuralRTI方法在有限硬件上也能实现全分辨率渲染，同时保持高质量的反射场重建。

Conclusion: 知识蒸馏是有效降低NeuralRTI计算成本的方法，解决了传统RTI方法的局限性，使高质量反射场重建在资源受限环境下变得可行。

Abstract: Reflectance Transformation Imaging (RTI) is very popular for its ability to
visually analyze surfaces by enhancing surface details through interactive
relighting, starting from only a few tens of photographs taken with a fixed
camera and variable illumination. Traditional methods like Polynomial Texture
Maps (PTM) and Hemispherical Harmonics (HSH) are compact and fast, but struggle
to accurately capture complex reflectance fields using few per-pixel
coefficients and fixed bases, leading to artifacts, especially in highly
reflective or shadowed areas. The NeuralRTI approach, which exploits a neural
autoencoder to learn a compact function that better approximates the local
reflectance as a function of light directions, has been shown to produce
superior quality at comparable storage cost. However, as it performs
interactive relighting with custom decoder networks with many parameters, the
rendering step is computationally expensive and not feasible at full resolution
for large images on limited hardware. Earlier attempts to reduce costs by
directly training smaller networks have failed to produce valid results. For
this reason, we propose to reduce its computational cost through a novel
solution based on Knowledge Distillation (DisK-NeuralRTI). ...

TL;DR: Latent Sketchpad框架为多模态大语言模型添加内部视觉草稿板，使其能够在推理过程中生成视觉潜在表示，从而支持视觉规划和想象能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型在视觉理解方面表现出色，但在需要视觉规划和想象的复杂场景中表现不佳。受人类使用草图进行视觉思维的启发，研究者希望为模型提供类似的视觉思考能力。

Method: 提出Latent Sketchpad框架，包含两个组件：上下文感知视觉头用于自回归生成视觉表示，预训练草图解码器将这些表示渲染为人类可解释的图像。该框架直接集成到模型的原生自回归推理过程中。

Result: 在MazePlanning数据集上的实验表明，Latent Sketchpad在保持推理能力的同时，提供了与骨干模型相当甚至更优的推理性能，并且能够泛化到不同的前沿MLLMs。

Conclusion: 通过将模型的文本推理扩展到视觉思维，该框架为人机交互和更广泛的应用开辟了新机会。

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at visual understanding,
they often struggle in complex scenarios that require visual planning and
imagination. Inspired by how humans use sketching as a form of visual thinking
to develop and communicate ideas, we introduce Latent Sketchpad, a framework
that equips MLLMs with an internal visual scratchpad. The internal visual
representations of MLLMs have traditionally been confined to perceptual
understanding. We repurpose them to support generative visual thought without
compromising reasoning ability. Building on frontier MLLMs, our approach
integrates visual generation directly into their native autoregressive
reasoning process. It allows the model to interleave textual reasoning with the
generation of visual latents. These latents guide the internal thought process
and can be translated into sketch images for interpretability. To realize this,
we introduce two components: a Context-Aware Vision Head autoregressively
produces visual representations, and a pretrained Sketch Decoder renders these
into human-interpretable images. We evaluate the framework on our new dataset
MazePlanning. Experiments across various MLLMs show that Latent Sketchpad
delivers comparable or even superior reasoning performance to their backbone.
It further generalizes across distinct frontier MLLMs, including Gemma3 and
Qwen2.5-VL. By extending model's textual reasoning to visual thinking, our
framework opens new opportunities for richer human-computer interaction and
broader applications. More details and resources are available on our project

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OSWorld-MCP是首个全面且公平的基准测试，用于评估计算机使用代理在真实环境中的工具调用、GUI操作和决策能力。通过自动代码生成管道创建工具，结合现有工具，验证了158个高质量工具。评估显示MCP工具能提高任务成功率，但最强模型的工具调用率也只有36.3%，表明仍有改进空间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 过去评估主要关注GUI交互技能，而工具调用能力（如通过模型上下文协议MCP启用）被忽视。比较集成工具调用的代理与仅评估GUI交互的代理本质上是不公平的。

Method: 设计新颖的自动代码生成管道来创建工具，并结合现有工具的选择。通过严格的手动验证产生158个高质量工具（覆盖7个常见应用），每个工具都验证了功能正确性、实际适用性和多功能性。

Result: 在OSWorld-MCP上对最先进的多模态代理进行广泛评估显示，MCP工具通常能提高任务成功率（例如OpenAI o3在15步时从8.3%提高到20.4%，Claude 4 Sonnet在50步时从40.1%提高到43.3%）。但即使最强模型的工具调用率也相对较低，只有36.3%。

Conclusion: 通过明确测量MCP工具使用技能，OSWorld-MCP加深了对多模态代理的理解，并为评估复杂工具辅助环境中的性能设定了新标准。

Abstract: With advances in decision-making and reasoning capabilities, multimodal
agents show strong potential in computer application scenarios. Past
evaluations have mainly assessed GUI interaction skills, while tool invocation
abilities, such as those enabled by the Model Context Protocol (MCP), have been
largely overlooked. Comparing agents with integrated tool invocation to those
evaluated only on GUI interaction is inherently unfair. We present OSWorld-MCP,
the first comprehensive and fair benchmark for assessing computer-use agents'
tool invocation, GUI operation, and decision-making abilities in a real-world
environment. We design a novel automated code-generation pipeline to create
tools and combine them with a curated selection from existing tools. Rigorous
manual validation yields 158 high-quality tools (covering 7 common
applications), each verified for correct functionality, practical
applicability, and versatility. Extensive evaluations of state-of-the-art
multimodal agents on OSWorld-MCP show that MCP tools generally improve task
success rates (e.g., from 8.3% to 20.4% for OpenAI o3 at 15 steps, from 40.1%
to 43.3% for Claude 4 Sonnet at 50 steps), underscoring the importance of
assessing tool invocation capabilities. However, even the strongest models have
relatively low tool invocation rates, Only 36.3%, indicating room for
improvement and highlighting the benchmark's challenge. By explicitly measuring
MCP tool usage skills, OSWorld-MCP deepens understanding of multimodal agents
and sets a new standard for evaluating performance in complex, tool-assisted
environments. Our code, environment, and data are publicly available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于深度学习的散射伪影校正方法，利用高斯径向基函数建模点散射函数，并嵌入Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks层来学习高维散射特征，有效校正CBCT重建图像中的散射伪影。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CBCT在数据采集过程中容易受到散射影响，导致CT值偏差和组织对比度降低，从而降低诊断准确性。需要解决散射引起的图像质量问题。

Method: 利用散射概率密度分布在投影域具有旋转对称性的物理先验知识，使用高斯径向基函数建模点散射函数，并将其嵌入KAN层中，结合散射光子分布的物理特性和KAN的复杂函数映射能力来学习高维散射特征。

Result: 通过合成和真实扫描实验验证，该方法能有效校正重建图像中的散射伪影，在定量指标上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 结合物理先验知识和深度学习的散射校正方法能够有效提升CBCT图像质量，为诊断准确性提供保障。

Abstract: Cone-beam CT (CBCT) employs a flat-panel detector to achieve
three-dimensional imaging with high spatial resolution. However, CBCT is
susceptible to scatter during data acquisition, which introduces CT value bias
and reduced tissue contrast in the reconstructed images, ultimately degrading
diagnostic accuracy. To address this issue, we propose a deep learning-based
scatter artifact correction method inspired by physical prior knowledge.
Leveraging the fact that the observed point scatter probability density
distribution exhibits rotational symmetry in the projection domain. The method
uses Gaussian Radial Basis Functions (RBF) to model the point scatter function
and embeds it into the Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) layer, which provides
efficient nonlinear mapping capabilities for learning high-dimensional scatter
features. By incorporating the physical characteristics of the scattered photon
distribution together with the complex function mapping capacity of KAN, the
model improves its ability to accurately represent scatter. The effectiveness
of the method is validated through both synthetic and real-scan experiments.
Experimental results show that the model can effectively correct the scatter
artifacts in the reconstructed images and is superior to the current methods in
terms of quantitative metrics.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative AI has enabled the creation of highly
realistic forged facial images, posing significant threats to AI security,
digital media integrity, and public trust. Face forgery techniques, ranging
from face swapping and attribute editing to powerful diffusion-based image
synthesis, are increasingly being used for malicious purposes such as
misinformation, identity fraud, and defamation. This growing challenge
underscores the urgent need for robust and generalizable face forgery detection
methods as a critical component of AI security infrastructure. In this work, we
propose a novel dual-branch convolutional neural network for face forgery
detection that leverages complementary cues from both spatial and frequency
domains. The RGB branch captures semantic information, while the frequency
branch focuses on high-frequency artifacts that are difficult for generative
models to suppress. A channel attention module is introduced to adaptively fuse
these heterogeneous features, highlighting the most informative channels for
forgery discrimination. To guide the network's learning process, we design a
unified loss function, FSC Loss, that combines focal loss, supervised
contrastive loss, and a frequency center margin loss to enhance class
separability and robustness. We evaluate our model on the DiFF benchmark, which
includes forged images generated from four representative methods:
text-to-image, image-to-image, face swap, and face edit. Our method achieves
strong performance across all categories and outperforms average human
accuracy. These results demonstrate the model's effectiveness and its potential
contribution to safeguarding AI ecosystems against visual forgery attacks.

Abstract: Interpretation of giga-pixel whole-slide images (WSIs) is an important but
difficult task for pathologists. Their diagnostic accuracy is estimated to

Method: 分析DiT模型中的MM-Attention机制，发现Query和Key token共享仅层依赖的偏置向量。将该偏置解释为模型固有编辑行为，token与其对应偏置的差值编码内容特定编辑信号。提出GRAG方法，重新加权不同token的delta值来调节模型对输入图像相对于编辑指令的关注度。

Result: 实验表明GRAG只需四行代码即可集成到现有编辑框架中，持续提升编辑质量。相比常用的Classifier-Free Guidance，GRAG能实现更平滑和精确的编辑程度控制。

Conclusion: GRAG是一种简单有效的方法，可在不进行任何调优的情况下实现对图像编辑强度的连续细粒度控制。

Abstract: Recently, image editing based on Diffusion-in-Transformer models has
undergone rapid development. However, existing editing methods often lack
effective control over the degree of editing, limiting their ability to achieve
more customized results. To address this limitation, we investigate the
MM-Attention mechanism within the DiT model and observe that the Query and Key
tokens share a bias vector that is only layer-dependent. We interpret this bias
as representing the model's inherent editing behavior, while the delta between
each token and its corresponding bias encodes the content-specific editing
signals. Based on this insight, we propose Group Relative Attention Guidance, a
simple yet effective method that reweights the delta values of different tokens
to modulate the focus of the model on the input image relative to the editing
instruction, enabling continuous and fine-grained control over editing
intensity without any tuning. Extensive experiments conducted on existing image
editing frameworks demonstrate that GRAG can be integrated with as few as four
lines of code, consistently enhancing editing quality. Moreover, compared to
the commonly used Classifier-Free Guidance, GRAG achieves smoother and more
precise control over the degree of editing. Our code will be released at
https://github.com/little-misfit/GRAG-Image-Editing.

*Mia Kan,Yilin Liu,Niloy Mitra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出SAGE方法，通过结构引导和生成合成实现零样本视频过渡，在多样视频片段间产生平滑、语义一致的过渡效果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视频过渡方法在处理大时间间隔或语义差异显著的视频片段时存在局限性，需要内容感知和视觉连贯的过渡方案

Method: 结合结构引导（线图和运动流）与生成合成的零样本方法，借鉴艺术工作流程中的轮廓对齐和显著特征插值策略

Result: 在定量指标和用户研究中优于传统方法和生成基线，能够处理多样视频片段间的过渡

Conclusion: SAGE方法通过结构感知的生成合成，实现了高质量的视频过渡，无需微调即可产生语义一致的过渡效果

Abstract: Video transitions aim to synthesize intermediate frames between two clips,
but naive approaches such as linear blending introduce artifacts that limit
professional use or break temporal coherence. Traditional techniques
(cross-fades, morphing, frame interpolation) and recent generative inbetweening
methods can produce high-quality plausible intermediates, but they struggle
with bridging diverse clips involving large temporal gaps or significant
semantic differences, leaving a gap for content-aware and visually coherent
transitions. We address this challenge by drawing on artistic workflows,
distilling strategies such as aligning silhouettes and interpolating salient
features to preserve structure and perceptual continuity. Building on this, we
propose SAGE (Structure-Aware Generative vidEo transitions) as a zeroshot
approach that combines structural guidance, provided via line maps and motion
flow, with generative synthesis, enabling smooth, semantically consistent
transitions without fine-tuning. Extensive experiments and comparison with
current alternatives, namely [FILM, TVG, DiffMorpher, VACE, GI], demonstrate
that SAGE outperforms both classical and generative baselines on quantitative
metrics and user studies for producing transitions between diverse clips. Code
to be released on acceptance.

TL;DR: MIC-BEV是一个基于Transformer的鸟瞰图感知框架，用于基础设施多摄像头3D目标检测，支持异构摄像头配置并在传感器退化下保持鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于摄像头的检测模型在基础设施感知场景中表现不佳，面临多视角设置、异构摄像头配置、视觉输入退化和不同道路布局等挑战。

Method: 提出图增强融合模块，利用摄像头与BEV单元间的几何关系和潜在视觉线索，将多视角图像特征集成到BEV空间中。

Conclusion: MIC-BEV展示了在真实世界部署的潜力，为智能交通系统的基础设施感知提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Infrastructure-based perception plays a crucial role in intelligent
transportation systems, offering global situational awareness and enabling
cooperative autonomy. However, existing camera-based detection models often
underperform in such scenarios due to challenges such as multi-view
infrastructure setup, diverse camera configurations, degraded visual inputs,
and various road layouts. We introduce MIC-BEV, a Transformer-based
bird's-eye-view (BEV) perception framework for infrastructure-based
multi-camera 3D object detection. MIC-BEV flexibly supports a variable number
of cameras with heterogeneous intrinsic and extrinsic parameters and
demonstrates strong robustness under sensor degradation. The proposed
graph-enhanced fusion module in MIC-BEV integrates multi-view image features
into the BEV space by exploiting geometric relationships between cameras and
BEV cells alongside latent visual cues. To support training and evaluation, we
introduce M2I, a synthetic dataset for infrastructure-based object detection,
featuring diverse camera configurations, road layouts, and environmental
conditions. Extensive experiments on both M2I and the real-world dataset
RoScenes demonstrate that MIC-BEV achieves state-of-the-art performance in 3D
object detection. It also remains robust under challenging conditions,
including extreme weather and sensor degradation. These results highlight the
potential of MIC-BEV for real-world deployment. The dataset and source code are

### [68] [Does Object Binding Naturally Emerge in Large Pretrained Vision Transformers?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24709)
*Yihao Li,Saeed Salehi,Lyle Ungar,Konrad P. Kording*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究发现预训练的视觉Transformer（ViT）中自然涌现出物体绑定能力，能够识别哪些图像块属于同一物体，这种能力在自监督模型中表现更强，且对下游任务性能有重要作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索视觉Transformer是否自然具备物体绑定能力，即识别哪些图像块属于同一物体的能力，以及这种能力如何影响模型性能。

Method: 使用相似性探针从ViT各层的图像块嵌入中解码"IsSameObject"信息，比较不同预训练目标（自监督vs监督学习）下的表现，并进行消融实验验证其重要性。

Result: 自监督ViT（DINO、MAE、CLIP）能够以超过90%的准确率解码IsSameObject信息，而ImageNet监督学习模型表现明显较弱；IsSameObject信号存在于低维子空间中并主动引导注意力。

Conclusion: ViT确实具备物体绑定能力，这种能力不是架构的副产品，而是通过特定预训练目标获得的，对模型性能至关重要，挑战了ViT缺乏物体绑定的观点。

Abstract: Object binding, the brain's ability to bind the many features that
collectively represent an object into a coherent whole, is central to human
cognition. It groups low-level perceptual features into high-level object
representations, stores those objects efficiently and compositionally in
memory, and supports human reasoning about individual object instances. While
prior work often imposes object-centric attention (e.g., Slot Attention)
explicitly to probe these benefits, it remains unclear whether this ability
naturally emerges in pre-trained Vision Transformers (ViTs). Intuitively, they
could: recognizing which patches belong to the same object should be useful for
downstream prediction and thus guide attention. Motivated by the quadratic
nature of self-attention, we hypothesize that ViTs represent whether two
patches belong to the same object, a property we term IsSameObject. We decode
IsSameObject from patch embeddings across ViT layers using a similarity probe,
which reaches over 90% accuracy. Crucially, this object-binding capability
emerges reliably in self-supervised ViTs (DINO, MAE, CLIP), but markedly weaker
in ImageNet-supervised models, suggesting that binding is not a trivial
architectural artifact, but an ability acquired through specific pretraining
objectives. We further discover that IsSameObject is encoded in a
low-dimensional subspace on top of object features, and that this signal
actively guides attention. Ablating IsSameObject from model activations
degrades downstream performance and works against the learning objective,
implying that emergent object binding naturally serves the pretraining
objective. Our findings challenge the view that ViTs lack object binding and
highlight how symbolic knowledge of "which parts belong together" emerges
naturally in a connectionist system.

TL;DR: ProMoE是一个专为扩散变换器设计的MoE框架，通过两步路由器和显式路由指导来解决视觉MoE中的专家专业化问题，在ImageNet基准测试中超越了现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MoE方法在语言模型中表现优异，但在扩散变换器中效果有限，主要原因是语言标记和视觉标记存在根本差异：语言标记语义密集且变化显著，而视觉标记具有空间冗余和功能异质性，阻碍了视觉MoE中的专家专业化。

Method: 提出ProMoE框架，包含两步路由器：1）条件路由根据功能角色将图像标记划分为条件集和无条件集；2）原型路由通过可学习原型基于语义内容细化条件图像标记的分配。还提出路由对比损失来增强原型路由过程。

Result: 在ImageNet基准测试中，ProMoE在Rectified Flow和DDPM两种训练目标下都超越了最先进的方法。

Conclusion: 显式语义指导对于视觉MoE至关重要，ProMoE通过两步路由机制成功解决了视觉MoE中的专家专业化问题，为扩散变换器的扩展提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for scaling model
capacity while preserving computational efficiency. Despite its notable success
in large language models (LLMs), existing attempts to apply MoE to Diffusion
Transformers (DiTs) have yielded limited gains. We attribute this gap to
fundamental differences between language and visual tokens. Language tokens are
semantically dense with pronounced inter-token variation, while visual tokens
exhibit spatial redundancy and functional heterogeneity, hindering expert
specialization in vision MoE. To this end, we present ProMoE, an MoE framework
featuring a two-step router with explicit routing guidance that promotes expert
specialization. Specifically, this guidance encourages the router to partition
image tokens into conditional and unconditional sets via conditional routing
according to their functional roles, and refine the assignments of conditional
image tokens through prototypical routing with learnable prototypes based on
semantic content. Moreover, the similarity-based expert allocation in latent
space enabled by prototypical routing offers a natural mechanism for
incorporating explicit semantic guidance, and we validate that such guidance is
crucial for vision MoE. Building on this, we propose a routing contrastive loss
that explicitly enhances the prototypical routing process, promoting
intra-expert coherence and inter-expert diversity. Extensive experiments on
ImageNet benchmark demonstrate that ProMoE surpasses state-of-the-art methods
under both Rectified Flow and DDPM training objectives. Code and models will be
made publicly available.

TL;DR: URSA是一个离散生成模型框架，通过线性化度量路径和分辨率相关时间步移机制，实现了高效的高分辨率图像合成和长视频生成，性能媲美连续扩散方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 连续空间视频生成发展迅速，而离散方法由于错误累积和长上下文不一致性问题而落后，需要重新审视离散生成建模来缩小与连续方法的差距。

Method: 将视频生成任务制定为离散时空标记的迭代全局优化，集成线性化度量路径和分辨率相关时间步移机制，并引入异步时间微调策略统一多种任务。

Result: 在具有挑战性的视频和图像生成基准测试中，URSA持续优于现有离散方法，并达到与最先进连续扩散方法相当的性能。

Conclusion: URSA证明了离散生成模型在视频生成任务中的潜力，能够高效扩展到高分辨率和长时长视频生成，同时需要更少的推理步骤。

Abstract: Continuous-space video generation has advanced rapidly, while discrete
approaches lag behind due to error accumulation and long-context inconsistency.
In this work, we revisit discrete generative modeling and present Uniform
discRete diffuSion with metric pAth (URSA), a simple yet powerful framework
that bridges the gap with continuous approaches for the scalable video
generation. At its core, URSA formulates the video generation task as an
iterative global refinement of discrete spatiotemporal tokens. It integrates
two key designs: a Linearized Metric Path and a Resolution-dependent Timestep
Shifting mechanism. These designs enable URSA to scale efficiently to
high-resolution image synthesis and long-duration video generation, while
requiring significantly fewer inference steps. Additionally, we introduce an
asynchronous temporal fine-tuning strategy that unifies versatile tasks within
a single model, including interpolation and image-to-video generation.
Extensive experiments on challenging video and image generation benchmarks
demonstrate that URSA consistently outperforms existing discrete methods and
achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art continuous diffusion
methods. Code and models are available at https://github.com/baaivision/URSA

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归视频扩散模型虽然能够进行长序列生成，但无法利用未来信息来指导当前生成，在预定义相机轨迹的场景中容易发生碰撞并导致生成崩溃。

Method: 基于扩散缝合技术，开发了与任何现成视频模型兼容的采样算法，引入了全向引导技术增强时间一致性，并提出了闭环机制确保长程连贯性。

Result: GVS实现了稳定、无碰撞、帧间一致的相机引导视频生成，能够处理各种预定义相机路径，包括不可能楼梯等复杂场景。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了自回归模型在相机引导生成中的局限性，为复杂相机轨迹的视频生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Autoregressive video diffusion models are capable of long rollouts that are
stable and consistent with history, but they are unable to guide the current
generation with conditioning from the future. In camera-guided video generation
with a predefined camera trajectory, this limitation leads to collisions with
the generated scene, after which autoregression quickly collapses. To address
this, we propose Generative View Stitching (GVS), which samples the entire
sequence in parallel such that the generated scene is faithful to every part of
the predefined camera trajectory. Our main contribution is a sampling algorithm
that extends prior work on diffusion stitching for robot planning to video
generation. While such stitching methods usually require a specially trained
model, GVS is compatible with any off-the-shelf video model trained with
Diffusion Forcing, a prevalent sequence diffusion framework that we show
already provides the affordances necessary for stitching. We then introduce
Omni Guidance, a technique that enhances the temporal consistency in stitching
by conditioning on both the past and future, and that enables our proposed
loop-closing mechanism for delivering long-range coherence. Overall, GVS
achieves camera-guided video generation that is stable, collision-free,
frame-to-frame consistent, and closes loops for a variety of predefined camera
paths, including Oscar Reutersv\"ard's Impossible Staircase. Results are best

Motivation: 现实世界中人类很少直接发出指令，需要机器人能够主动推断用户意图，而现有方法主要依赖显式指令，无法满足真实交互需求。

Method: 提出RoboOmni框架，采用Perceiver-Thinker-Talker-Executor架构，基于端到端全模态LLM，时空融合听觉和视觉信号进行意图识别，支持语音交互。

Result: 在仿真和真实环境实验中，RoboOmni在成功率、推理速度、意图识别和主动协助方面优于基于文本和ASR的基线方法。

Conclusion: RoboOmni通过跨模态上下文指令和主动意图识别，显著提升了机器人操作的协作能力，为真实世界人机交互提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have driven rapid
progress in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models for robotic manipulation.
Although effective in many scenarios, current approaches largely rely on
explicit instructions, whereas in real-world interactions, humans rarely issue
instructions directly. Effective collaboration requires robots to infer user
intentions proactively. In this work, we introduce cross-modal contextual
instructions, a new setting where intent is derived from spoken dialogue,
environmental sounds, and visual cues rather than explicit commands. To address
this new setting, we present RoboOmni, a Perceiver-Thinker-Talker-Executor
framework based on end-to-end omni-modal LLMs that unifies intention
recognition, interaction confirmation, and action execution. RoboOmni fuses
auditory and visual signals spatiotemporally for robust intention recognition,
while supporting direct speech interaction. To address the absence of training
data for proactive intention recognition in robotic manipulation, we build
OmniAction, comprising 140k episodes, 5k+ speakers, 2.4k event sounds, 640
backgrounds, and six contextual instruction types. Experiments in simulation
and real-world settings show that RoboOmni surpasses text- and ASR-based
baselines in success rate, inference speed, intention recognition, and
proactive assistance.

Motivation: 虽然社交机器人在学习任务中的支持效果已被广泛研究，但它们在自主学习情境中的潜在影响尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 采用探索性的Wizard-of-Oz研究，比较了提供目标提醒、情感支持和仅提供物理存在（控制组）三种条件下机器人对学生感知专注度、生产力和参与度的影响。

Result: 目标提醒和情感支持条件下的参与者报告了更高的使用便捷性，目标提醒条件还显示出更高的未来使用意愿。参与者对机器人的满意度与其将机器人视为社会实体的感知相关，这种感知能预测他们在自主学习任务中的目标达成程度。

Conclusion: 这些发现强调了社交辅助机器人通过功能和情感参与来支持自主学习的潜力。

Abstract: While the efficacy of social robots in supporting people in learning tasks
has been extensively investigated, their potential impact in assisting students
in self-studying contexts has not been investigated much. This study explores
how a social robot can act as a peer study companion for college students
during self-study tasks by delivering task-oriented goal reminder and positive
emotional support. We conducted an exploratory Wizard-of-Oz study to explore
how these robotic support behaviors impacted students' perceived focus,
productivity, and engagement in comparison to a robot that only provided
physical presence (control). Our study results suggest that participants in the
goal reminder and the emotional support conditions reported greater ease of
use, with the goal reminder condition additionally showing a higher willingness
to use the robot in future study sessions. Participants' satisfaction with the
robot was correlated with their perception of the robot as a social other, and
this perception was found to be a predictor for their level of goal achievement
in the self-study task. These findings highlight the potential of socially
assistive robots to support self-study through both functional and emotional
engagement.

Conclusion: 该方法降低了在预算受限的机器人平台上部署自主导航和鲁棒运动策略的门槛。

Abstract: Wheeled-legged robots combine the efficiency of wheels with the obstacle
negotiation of legs, yet many state-of-the-art systems rely on costly actuators
and sensors, and fall-recovery is seldom integrated, especially for
wheeled-legged morphologies. This work presents a recovery-aware
visual-inertial navigation system on a low-cost wheeled quadruped. The proposed
system leverages vision-based perception from a depth camera and deep
reinforcement learning policies for robust locomotion and autonomous recovery
from falls across diverse terrains. Simulation experiments show agile mobility
with low-torque actuators over irregular terrain and reliably recover from
external perturbations and self-induced failures. We further show goal directed
navigation in structured indoor spaces with low-cost perception. Overall, this
approach lowers the barrier to deploying autonomous navigation and robust
locomotion policies in budget-constrained robotic platforms.

Motivation: 解决动态环境中实时感知的数据瓶颈问题，通过动态选择最具信息量的帧来创建高质量的3D世界表示，这对复杂动态环境中的机器人学习和部署至关重要。

Method: 集成两个互补模块：基于光度误差和结构相似性(SSIM)误差的选择模块，以及根据场景运动动态调整关键帧选择阈值的动量更新模块。

Conclusion: 该方法代表了自适应感知系统的重要进展，能够动态响应复杂和演变的视觉场景，在动态环境中实现更高质量的3D重建。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose an adaptive keyframe selection method for improved
3D scene reconstruction in dynamic environments. The proposed method integrates
two complementary modules: an error-based selection module utilizing
photometric and structural similarity (SSIM) errors, and a momentum-based
update module that dynamically adjusts keyframe selection thresholds according
to scene motion dynamics. By dynamically curating the most informative frames,
our approach addresses a key data bottleneck in real-time perception. This
allows for the creation of high-quality 3D world representations from a
compressed data stream, a critical step towards scalable robot learning and
deployment in complex, dynamic environments. Experimental results demonstrate
significant improvements over traditional static keyframe selection strategies,
such as fixed temporal intervals or uniform frame skipping. These findings
highlight a meaningful advancement toward adaptive perception systems that can
dynamically respond to complex and evolving visual scenes. We evaluate our
proposed adaptive keyframe selection module on two recent state-of-the-art 3D
reconstruction networks, Spann3r and CUT3R, and observe consistent improvements
in reconstruction quality across both frameworks. Furthermore, an extensive
ablation study confirms the effectiveness of each individual component in our
method, underlining their contribution to the overall performance gains.

Abstract: Tendon-actuated concentric tube mechanisms combine the advantages of
tendon-driven continuum robots and concentric tube robots while addressing
their respective limitations. They overcome the restricted degrees of freedom
often seen in tendon-driven designs, and mitigate issues such as snapping
instability associated with concentric tube robots. However, a complete and
general mechanical model for these systems remains an open problem. In this
work, we propose a Cosserat rod-based framework for modeling the general case
of $n$ concentric tubes, each actuated by $m_i$ tendons, where $i = \{1,
\ldots, n\}$. The model allows each tube to twist and elongate while enforcing
a shared centerline for bending. We validate the proposed framework through
experiments with two-tube and three tube assemblies under various tendon
routing configurations, achieving tip prediction errors $<4\%$ of the robot's
total length. We further demonstrate the model's generality by applying it to
existing robots in the field, where maximum tip deviations remain around $5\%$
of the total length. This model provides a foundation for accurate shape
estimation and control of advanced tendon-actuated concentric tube robots.

Conclusion: 提出的可变刚度软机器人手指实现了自适应扭转变形和包裹式抓取功能，为密集环境下的物体抓取提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: This paper presents a soft robot finger capable of adaptive-twist deformation
to grasp objects by wrapping them. For a soft hand to grasp and pick-up one
object from densely contained multiple objects, a soft finger requires the
adaptive-twist deformation function in both in-plane and out-of-plane
directions. The function allows the finger to be inserted deeply into a limited
gap among objects. Once inserted, the soft finger requires appropriate control
of grasping force normal to contact surface, thereby maintaining the twisted
deformation. In this paper, we refer to this type of grasping as grasping by
wrapping. To achieve these two functions by a single actuation source, we
propose a variable stiffness mechanism that can adaptively change the stiffness
as the pressure is higher. We conduct a finite element analysis (FEA) on the
proposed mechanism and determine its design parameter based on the FEA result.
Using the developed soft finger, we report basic experimental results and
demonstrations on grasping various objects.

Abstract: This survey comprehensively reviews the evolving field of multi-robot
collaborative Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) using 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS). As an explicit scene representation, 3DGS has enabled
unprecedented real-time, high-fidelity rendering, ideal for robotics. However,
its use in multi-robot systems introduces significant challenges in maintaining
global consistency, managing communication, and fusing data from heterogeneous
sources. We systematically categorize approaches by their architecture --
centralized, distributed -- and analyze core components like multi-agent

Conclusion: VOCALoco框架通过模块化技能选择有效解决了端到端DRL方法在安全性和可解释性方面的不足，为腿式机器人在复杂地形上的运动提供了更可靠的解决方案

Abstract: Recent advancements in legged robot locomotion have facilitated traversal
over increasingly complex terrains. Despite this progress, many existing
approaches rely on end-to-end deep reinforcement learning (DRL), which poses
limitations in terms of safety and interpretability, especially when
generalizing to novel terrains. To overcome these challenges, we introduce
VOCALoco, a modular skill-selection framework that dynamically adapts
locomotion strategies based on perceptual input. Given a set of pre-trained
locomotion policies, VOCALoco evaluates their viability and energy-consumption
by predicting both the safety of execution and the anticipated cost of
transport over a fixed planning horizon. This joint assessment enables the
selection of policies that are both safe and energy-efficient, given the
observed local terrain. We evaluate our approach on staircase locomotion tasks,
demonstrating its performance in both simulated and real-world scenarios using
a quadrupedal robot. Empirical results show that VOCALoco achieves improved
robustness and safety during stair ascent and descent compared to a
conventional end-to-end DRL policy

*Andrew Gerstenslager,Bekarys Dukenbaev,Ali A. Minai*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种将垂直角度敏感性融入边界向量细胞(BVC)框架的3D模型，解决了传统2D BVC模型在水平对称环境中容易产生空间模糊的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统BVC模型仅限于2D环境，在存在水平对称性的环境中容易产生空间模糊，需要扩展到3D空间以实现更准确的空间定位。

Method: 通过处理LiDAR数据捕捉垂直轮廓，将垂直角度敏感性整合到BVC框架中，实现3D边界检测。

Result: 在垂直变化最小的环境中，3D模型与2D基线性能相当；但随着3D复杂性增加，能产生更多独特的场所场并显著减少空间混叠。

Conclusion: 在BVC定位中添加垂直维度可以显著增强真实3D空间中的导航和映射能力，同时在简单近平面场景中保持性能相当。

Abstract: Boundary Vector Cells (BVCs) are a class of neurons in the brains of
vertebrates that encode environmental boundaries at specific distances and
allocentric directions, playing a central role in forming place fields in the
hippocampus. Most computational BVC models are restricted to two-dimensional
(2D) environments, making them prone to spatial ambiguities in the presence of
horizontal symmetries in the environment. To address this limitation, we
incorporate vertical angular sensitivity into the BVC framework, thereby
enabling robust boundary detection in three dimensions, and leading to
significantly more accurate spatial localization in a biologically-inspired
robot model.
  The proposed model processes LiDAR data to capture vertical contours, thereby
disambiguating locations that would be indistinguishable under a purely 2D
representation. Experimental results show that in environments with minimal
vertical variation, the proposed 3D model matches the performance of a 2D
baseline; yet, as 3D complexity increases, it yields substantially more
distinct place fields and markedly reduces spatial aliasing. These findings
show that adding a vertical dimension to BVC-based localization can
significantly enhance navigation and mapping in real-world 3D spaces while
retaining performance parity in simpler, near-planar scenarios.

TL;DR: SynAD是首个利用合成数据增强端到端自动驾驶模型的框架，通过在多智能体合成场景中指定具有最全面驾驶信息的智能体作为自车，将路径级场景投影到地图上，并使用新开发的Map-to-BEV网络获取鸟瞰图特征，有效整合合成数据与真实数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管深度学习和高质量真实驾驶数据集推动了端到端自动驾驶的发展，但仅依赖真实数据限制了训练场景的多样性。合成场景生成虽然能丰富训练数据，但在端到端自动驾驶模型中的应用尚未充分探索，主要因为缺乏指定的自车和传感器输入。

Method: 在多智能体合成场景中指定具有最全面驾驶信息的智能体作为自车；将路径级场景投影到地图上；开发Map-to-BEV网络从地图中提取鸟瞰图特征；设计训练策略有效整合地图基础的合成数据与真实驾驶数据。

Result: 实验结果表明SynAD有效整合了所有组件，显著提升了安全性能。

Conclusion: SynAD通过桥接合成场景生成与端到端自动驾驶，为更全面和鲁棒的自动驾驶模型铺平了道路。

Abstract: Recent advancements in deep learning and the availability of high-quality
real-world driving datasets have propelled end-to-end autonomous driving.
Despite this progress, relying solely on real-world data limits the variety of
driving scenarios for training. Synthetic scenario generation has emerged as a
promising solution to enrich the diversity of training data; however, its
application within E2E AD models remains largely unexplored. This is primarily
due to the absence of a designated ego vehicle and the associated sensor
inputs, such as camera or LiDAR, typically provided in real-world scenarios. To
address this gap, we introduce SynAD, the first framework designed to enhance
real-world E2E AD models using synthetic data. Our method designates the agent
with the most comprehensive driving information as the ego vehicle in a
multi-agent synthetic scenario. We further project path-level scenarios onto
maps and employ a newly developed Map-to-BEV Network to derive bird's-eye-view
features without relying on sensor inputs. Finally, we devise a training
strategy that effectively integrates these map-based synthetic data with real
driving data. Experimental results demonstrate that SynAD effectively
integrates all components and notably enhances safety performance. By bridging
synthetic scenario generation and E2E AD, SynAD paves the way for more
comprehensive and robust autonomous driving models.

Abstract: Perceptual ambiguity and task conflict limit multitask robotic manipulation
via imitation learning. We propose a framework combining a Language-Conditioned
Visual Representation (LCVR) module and a Language-conditioned
Mixture-ofExperts Density Policy (LMoE-DP). LCVR resolves perceptual
ambiguities by grounding visual features with language instructions, enabling
differentiation between visually similar tasks. To mitigate task conflict,
LMoE-DP uses a sparse expert architecture to specialize in distinct, multimodal
action distributions, stabilized by gradient modulation. On real-robot
benchmarks, LCVR boosts Action Chunking with Transformers (ACT) and Diffusion
Policy (DP) success rates by 33.75% and 25%, respectively. The full framework
achieves a 79% average success, outperforming the advanced baseline by 21%. Our
work shows that combining semantic grounding and expert specialization enables

Abstract: To generate reliable motion for legged robots through trajectory
optimization, it is crucial to simultaneously compute the robot's path and
contact sequence, as well as accurately consider the dynamics in the problem
formulation. In this paper, we present a phase-based trajectory optimization
that ensures the feasibility of translational dynamics and friction cone
constraints throughout the entire trajectory. Specifically, our approach
leverages the superposition properties of linear differential equations to
decouple the translational dynamics for each contact point, which operates
under different phase sequences. Furthermore, we utilize the differentiation
matrix of B{\'e}zier polynomials to derive an analytical relationship between
the robot's position and force, thereby ensuring the consistent satisfaction of
translational dynamics. Additionally, by exploiting the convex closure property
of B{\'e}zier polynomials, our method ensures compliance with friction cone
constraints. Using the aforementioned approach, the proposed trajectory
optimization framework can generate dynamically reliable motions with various
gait sequences for legged robots. We validate our framework using a quadruped
robot model, focusing on the feasibility of dynamics and motion generation.

TL;DR: ZTRS是首个完全消除模仿学习的端到端自动驾驶框架，仅通过奖励学习直接在传感器数据上操作，结合了离线强化学习和提出的穷举策略优化方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有端到端自动驾驶框架主要依赖模仿学习，但受限于次优专家演示和部署时的协变量偏移问题。强化学习虽然能利用模拟环境扩展，但通常局限于低维符号输入，无法实现真正的端到端学习。

Method: 提出ZTRS框架，结合离线强化学习和穷举策略优化(EPO)，这是一种针对可枚举动作和奖励的策略梯度变体，直接在传感器数据上进行训练。

Result: 在三个基准测试中表现优异：Navtest(通用现实世界开环规划)、Navhard(挑战性现实世界和合成场景开环规划)、HUGSIM(模拟闭环驾驶)。在Navhard上达到最先进结果，在HUGSIM上优于基于模仿学习的基线方法。

Conclusion: ZTRS证明了完全消除模仿学习的可行性，通过纯强化学习方法在端到端自动驾驶中取得了优异性能，为传感器输入和鲁棒规划的结合提供了新思路。

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving maps raw sensor inputs directly into
ego-vehicle trajectories to avoid cascading errors from perception modules and
to leverage rich semantic cues. Existing frameworks largely rely on Imitation
Learning (IL), which can be limited by sub-optimal expert demonstrations and
covariate shift during deployment. On the other hand, Reinforcement Learning
(RL) has recently shown potential in scaling up with simulations, but is
typically confined to low-dimensional symbolic inputs (e.g. 3D objects and
maps), falling short of full end-to-end learning from raw sensor data. We
introduce ZTRS (Zero-Imitation End-to-End Autonomous Driving with Trajectory
Scoring), a framework that combines the strengths of both worlds: sensor inputs
without losing information and RL training for robust planning. To the best of
our knowledge, ZTRS is the first framework that eliminates IL entirely by only
learning from rewards while operating directly on high-dimensional sensor data.
ZTRS utilizes offline reinforcement learning with our proposed Exhaustive
Policy Optimization (EPO), a variant of policy gradient tailored for enumerable
actions and rewards. ZTRS demonstrates strong performance across three
benchmarks: Navtest (generic real-world open-loop planning), Navhard (open-loop
planning in challenging real-world and synthetic scenarios), and HUGSIM
(simulated closed-loop driving). Specifically, ZTRS achieves the
state-of-the-art result on Navhard and outperforms IL-based baselines on
HUGSIM. Code will be available at https://github.com/woxihuanjiangguo/ZTRS.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has marked a
significant breakthrough in Artificial Intelligence (AI), ushering in a new era
of Human-centered Artificial Intelligence (HAI). HAI aims to better serve human
welfare and needs, thereby placing higher demands on the intelligence level of
robots, particularly in aspects such as natural language interaction, complex
task planning, and execution. Intelligent agents powered by LLMs have opened up
new pathways for realizing HAI. However, existing LLM-based embodied agents
often lack the ability to plan and execute complex natural language control
tasks online. This paper explores the implementation of intelligent robotic
manipulating agents based on Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in the physical
world. We propose a novel embodied agent framework for robots, which comprises
a human-robot voice interaction module, a vision-language agent module and an
action execution module. The vision-language agent itself includes a
vision-based task planner, a natural language instruction converter, and a task
performance feedback evaluator. Experimental results demonstrate that our agent
achieves a 28\% higher average task success rate in both simulated and real
environments compared to approaches relying solely on LLM+CLIP, significantly
improving the execution success rate of high-level natural language instruction
tasks.

Abstract: Navigating to a designated goal using visual information is a fundamental
capability for intelligent robots. Most classical visual navigation methods are
restricted to single-goal, single-modality, and closed set goal settings. To
address the practical demands of multi-modal, open-vocabulary goal queries and
multi-goal visual navigation, we propose LagMemo, a navigation system that
leverages a language 3D Gaussian Splatting memory. During exploration, LagMemo
constructs a unified 3D language memory. With incoming task goals, the system
queries the memory, predicts candidate goal locations, and integrates a local
perception-based verification mechanism to dynamically match and validate goals
during navigation. For fair and rigorous evaluation, we curate GOAT-Core, a
high-quality core split distilled from GOAT-Bench tailored to multi-modal
open-vocabulary multi-goal visual navigation. Experimental results show that
LagMemo's memory module enables effective multi-modal open-vocabulary goal
localization, and that LagMemo outperforms state-of-the-art methods in

Abstract: Behavioral cloning is a simple yet effective technique for learning
sequential decision-making from demonstrations. Recently, it has gained
prominence as the core of foundation models for the physical world, where
achieving generalization requires countless demonstrations of a multitude of
tasks. Typically, a human expert with full information on the task demonstrates
a (nearly) optimal behavior. In this paper, we propose to hide some of the
task's information from the demonstrator. This ``blindfolded'' expert is
compelled to employ non-trivial exploration to solve the task. We show that
cloning the blindfolded expert generalizes better to unseen tasks than its
fully-informed counterpart. We conduct experiments of real-world robot peg
insertion tasks with (limited) human demonstrations, alongside videogames from
the Procgen benchmark. Additionally, we support our findings with theoretical
analysis, which confirms that the generalization error scales with
$\sqrt{I/m}$, where $I$ measures the amount of task information available to
the demonstrator, and $m$ is the number of demonstrated tasks. Both theory and
practice indicate that cloning blindfolded experts generalizes better with
fewer demonstrated tasks. Project page with videos and code:

Conclusion: HMAMP代表了向开发能与人类更自然交互的机器人和自主系统迈出的重要一步，通过学习类似人类的工具和物体操纵方式。

Abstract: In recent years, there has been growing interest in developing robots and
autonomous systems that can interact with human in a more natural and intuitive
way. One of the key challenges in achieving this goal is to enable these
systems to manipulate objects and tools in a manner that is similar to that of
humans. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for learning human-style
manipulation skills by using adversarial motion priors, which we name HMAMP.
The approach leverages adversarial networks to model the complex dynamics of
tool and object manipulation, as well as the aim of the manipulation task. The
discriminator is trained using a combination of real-world data and simulation
data executed by the agent, which is designed to train a policy that generates
realistic motion trajectories that match the statistical properties of human
motion. We evaluated HMAMP on one challenging manipulation task: hammering, and
the results indicate that HMAMP is capable of learning human-style manipulation
skills that outperform current baseline methods. Additionally, we demonstrate
that HMAMP has potential for real-world applications by performing real robot
arm hammering tasks. In general, HMAMP represents a significant step towards
developing robots and autonomous systems that can interact with humans in a
more natural and intuitive way, by learning to manipulate tools and objects in
a manner similar to how humans do.

Motivation: 解决机器人操作策略泛化能力差的问题，现有方法要么依赖2D视觉预训练（只关注静态语义或场景几何），要么使用大规模视频预测模型（只关注2D动态），无法同时学习几何、语义和动态信息。

Method: 通过掩码重建和未来预测，使用可微分体积渲染学习3D感知和动态感知的三平面特征，在多视角RGB-D视频数据上进行预训练。

Result: 在RLBench和Colosseum基准测试以及真实机器人实验中，DynaRend显著提高了策略成功率、对环境扰动的泛化能力，并在多样化操作任务中展现出实际应用价值。

Conclusion: DynaRend能够统一地捕捉空间几何、未来动态和任务语义，学习到的表示可以通过动作价值图预测有效迁移到下游机器人操作任务中。

Abstract: Learning generalizable robotic manipulation policies remains a key challenge
due to the scarcity of diverse real-world training data. While recent
approaches have attempted to mitigate this through self-supervised
representation learning, most either rely on 2D vision pretraining paradigms
such as masked image modeling, which primarily focus on static semantics or
scene geometry, or utilize large-scale video prediction models that emphasize
2D dynamics, thus failing to jointly learn the geometry, semantics, and
dynamics required for effective manipulation. In this paper, we present
DynaRend, a representation learning framework that learns 3D-aware and
dynamics-informed triplane features via masked reconstruction and future
prediction using differentiable volumetric rendering. By pretraining on
multi-view RGB-D video data, DynaRend jointly captures spatial geometry, future
dynamics, and task semantics in a unified triplane representation. The learned
representations can be effectively transferred to downstream robotic
manipulation tasks via action value map prediction. We evaluate DynaRend on two
challenging benchmarks, RLBench and Colosseum, as well as in real-world robotic
experiments, demonstrating substantial improvements in policy success rate,
generalization to environmental perturbations, and real-world applicability
across diverse manipulation tasks.

Motivation: CoNi-MPC框架在空地协同任务中依赖相对状态进行UAV控制，但缺乏环境信息导致障碍物避让面临挑战。

Method: 利用UAV的单帧原始LiDAR数据生成调制矩阵，直接调整四旋翼速度实现障碍物避让，在UGV的非惯性坐标系中实时生成无碰撞轨迹。

Result: 计算需求显著降低（每次迭代小于5毫秒），在动态和不可预测环境中保持安全性，适用于静态和动态环境。

Conclusion: CoNi-OA算法为UAV-UGV协同提供了一种高效、实时的障碍物避让解决方案，无需全局状态估计或障碍物预测，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: CoNi-MPC provides an efficient framework for UAV control in air-ground
cooperative tasks by relying exclusively on relative states, eliminating the
need for global state estimation. However, its lack of environmental
information poses significant challenges for obstacle avoidance. To address
this issue, we propose a novel obstacle avoidance algorithm, Cooperative
Non-inertial frame-based Obstacle Avoidance (CoNi-OA), designed explicitly for
UAV-UGV cooperative scenarios without reliance on global state estimation or
obstacle prediction. CoNi-OA uniquely utilizes a single frame of raw LiDAR data
from the UAV to generate a modulation matrix, which directly adjusts the
quadrotor's velocity to achieve obstacle avoidance. This modulation-based
method enables real-time generation of collision-free trajectories within the
UGV's non-inertial frame, significantly reducing computational demands (less
than 5 ms per iteration) while maintaining safety in dynamic and unpredictable
environments. The key contributions of this work include: (1) a
modulation-based obstacle avoidance algorithm specifically tailored for UAV-UGV
cooperation in non-inertial frames without global states; (2) rapid, real-time
trajectory generation based solely on single-frame LiDAR data, removing the
need for obstacle modeling or prediction; and (3) adaptability to both static
and dynamic environments, thus extending applicability to featureless or
unknown scenarios.

adapts 3D Gaussian Splatting to address visual artifacts on sparsely observed
floors a common issue in robotic traversal data. We introduce Floor-Aware
Gaussian Splatting to ensure a clean, navigable ground plane, and a novel
mesh-free traversability checking algorithm that constructs a topological graph
by directly analyzing rendered views. We demonstrate our system's ability to
generate valid, large-scale navigation graphs from real-world data. A video

*Jorge Vicente-Martinez,Edgar Ramirez-Laboreo*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出一种基于微分平坦性的3D桥式起重机最优轨迹生成方法，能够直接处理非线性摩擦和碰撞避免等复杂约束，实现快速安全的起重机运动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统起重机轨迹规划方法难以有效处理非线性摩擦和碰撞避免等复杂物理约束，导致实际应用中可能出现执行器饱和和碰撞问题。

Method: 利用微分平坦性理论构建轨迹生成框架，直接纳入非线性摩擦和载荷绳索碰撞避免约束，仅在终点约束载荷摆动。

Result: 对比仿真验证表明，忽略干摩擦会导致执行器饱和和碰撞，而摩擦建模是实现快速安全起重机轨迹的基本要求。

Conclusion: 基于微分平坦性的轨迹生成方法能够有效处理复杂约束，是实现3D桥式起重机快速安全运动的关键技术。

Abstract: This paper presents an optimal trajectory generation method for 3D overhead
cranes by leveraging differential flatness. This framework enables the direct
inclusion of complex physical and dynamic constraints, such as nonlinear
friction and collision avoidance for both payload and rope. Our approach allows
for aggressive movements by constraining payload swing only at the final point.
A comparative simulation study validates our approach, demonstrating that
neglecting dry friction leads to actuator saturation and collisions. The
results show that friction modeling is a fundamental requirement for fast and
safe crane trajectories.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种双层优化方法，通过贝叶斯视角分解里程计和监控测量的联合似然，将嵌套的贝叶斯依赖转换为链式结构，实现高效的并行计算来估计传感器噪声协方差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实践中传感器噪声协方差难以准确确定，因为受到环境变化、前端预处理等因素影响，而可靠的状态估计依赖于准确的噪声协方差规范。

Method: 采用双层优化框架：下层使用不变扩展卡尔曼滤波进行轨迹估计，同时并行计算分析梯度；上层通过梯度更新优化协方差参数。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验表明，该方法比现有基线方法具有更高的效率。

Conclusion: 该方法通过有效的并行计算架构，成功解决了传感器噪声协方差估计问题，在效率和性能上优于现有方法。

Abstract: Reliable state estimation hinges on accurate specification of sensor noise
covariances, which weigh heterogeneous measurements. In practice, these
covariances are difficult to identify due to environmental variability,
front-end preprocessing, and other reasons. We address this by formulating
noise covariance estimation as a bilevel optimization that, from a Bayesian
perspective, factorizes the joint likelihood of so-called odometry and
supervisory measurements, thereby balancing information utilization with
computational efficiency. The factorization converts the nested Bayesian
dependency into a chain structure, enabling efficient parallel computation: at
the lower level, an invariant extended Kalman filter with state augmentation
estimates trajectories, while a derivative filter computes analytical gradients
in parallel for upper-level gradient updates. The upper level refines the
covariance to guide the lower-level estimation. Experiments on synthetic and
real-world datasets show that our method achieves higher efficiency over
existing baselines.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了随机奖励收集游戏(SPCG)作为团队定向问题(TOP)的扩展，用于在自利机器人、能量约束和随机转移条件下进行规划。通过理论分析和算法设计，证明了在特定条件下存在纯纳什均衡，且学习到的策略在大型团队规模和不同奖励分布下具有良好泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的团队定向问题(TOP)变体假设所有机器人合作追求单一目标，无法扩展到奖励稀缺环境中机器人竞争的场景。需要开发能够处理自利机器人在图上操作、受能量约束和随机转移影响的规划方法。

Method: 提出了两种算法：1) 序数排名搜索(ORS)用于获取游戏阶段中临时形成局部邻域的有效排名；2) 虚构序数响应学习(FORL)用于获取对高排名对手的最佳响应策略。在道路网络和合成图上进行了实证评估。

Result: 实验表明：1) OR条件化引起的状态混叠使学习策略比使用全局索引的策略更能扩展到大型团队规模；2) 使用FORL训练的策略比其他多智能体训练方法在非平衡奖励分布下泛化更好；3) 学习到的策略达到了等效TOP混合整数线性规划解的87%-95%最优性。

Conclusion: SPCG框架成功扩展了TOP以处理竞争性多机器人环境，提出的算法在可扩展性和泛化性方面表现优异，学习到的策略接近最优解，为奖励稀缺环境中的多机器人规划提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The Team Orienteering Problem (TOP) generalizes many real-world multi-robot
scheduling and routing tasks that occur in autonomous mobility, aerial
logistics, and surveillance applications. While many flavors of the TOP exist
for planning in multi-robot systems, they assume that all the robots cooperate
toward a single objective; thus, they do not extend to settings where the
robots compete in reward-scarce environments. We propose Stochastic
Prize-Collecting Games (SPCG) as an extension of the TOP to plan in the
presence of self-interested robots operating on a graph, under energy
constraints and stochastic transitions. A theoretical study on complete and
star graphs establishes that there is a unique pure Nash equilibrium in SPCGs
that coincides with the optimal routing solution of an equivalent TOP given a
rank-based conflict resolution rule. This work proposes two algorithms: Ordinal
Rank Search (ORS) to obtain the ''ordinal rank'' --one's effective rank in
temporarily-formed local neighborhoods during the games' stages, and Fictitious
Ordinal Response Learning (FORL) to obtain best-response policies against one's
senior-rank opponents. Empirical evaluations conducted on road networks and
synthetic graphs under both dynamic and stationary prize distributions show
that 1) the state-aliasing induced by OR-conditioning enables learning policies
that scale more efficiently to large team sizes than those trained with the
global index, and 2) Policies trained with FORL generalize better to imbalanced
prize distributions than those with other multi-agent training methods.
Finally, the learned policies in the SPCG achieved between 87% and 95%
optimality compared to an equivalent TOP solution obtained by mixed-integer
linear programming.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: GeVI-SLAM是一个重力增强的立体视觉惯性SLAM系统，通过利用立体相机直接深度估计能力、精确重力初始化和4自由度PnP求解器，解决了水下机器人视觉退化和IMU运动激励不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下机器人VI SLAM面临视觉频繁退化和IMU运动激励不足的挑战，需要开发更稳定和准确的定位与建图系统。

Method: 使用立体相机直接深度估计避免尺度估计需求；通过重力初始化解耦俯仰和滚转，采用4自由度PnP最小3点求解器；提出偏差消除的4-DOF PnP估计器；动态运动时联合估计IMU协方差进行全6自由度姿态优化。

Result: 在模拟和真实世界数据上的广泛实验表明，GeVI-SLAM相比最先进方法具有更高的精度和更好的稳定性。

Conclusion: GeVI-SLAM通过重力增强和4自由度PnP方法，有效解决了水下VI SLAM的挑战，实现了更准确和稳定的性能。

Abstract: Accurate visual inertial simultaneous localization and mapping (VI SLAM) for
underwater robots remains a significant challenge due to frequent visual
degeneracy and insufficient inertial measurement unit (IMU) motion excitation.
In this paper, we present GeVI-SLAM, a gravity-enhanced stereo VI SLAM system
designed to address these issues. By leveraging the stereo camera's direct
depth estimation ability, we eliminate the need to estimate scale during IMU
initialization, enabling stable operation even under low acceleration dynamics.
With precise gravity initialization, we decouple the pitch and roll from the
pose estimation and solve a 4 degrees of freedom (DOF) Perspective-n-Point
(PnP) problem for pose tracking. This allows the use of a minimal 3-point
solver, which significantly reduces computational time to reject outliers
within a Random Sample Consensus framework. We further propose a
bias-eliminated 4-DOF PnP estimator with provable consistency, ensuring the
relative pose converges to the true value as the feature number increases. To
handle dynamic motion, we refine the full 6-DOF pose while jointly estimating
the IMU covariance, enabling adaptive weighting of the gravity prior. Extensive
experiments on simulated and real-world data demonstrate that GeVI-SLAM
achieves higher accuracy and greater stability compared to state-of-the-art
methods.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种分层框架来支持环境不确定性下的机器人巡检，通过全局视图规划和局部视图重规划相结合，在保持全局覆盖目标的同时适应局部表面形态变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖已知环境模型规划巡检路线，但模型与实际现场条件之间的差异（由自然或人为活动引起）可能改变表面形态或引入路径障碍，需要能够适应环境不确定性的解决方案。

Method: 将巡检任务分为两个层次：(a)基于历史地图生成感兴趣区域的初始全局视图规划；(b)局部视图重规划以适应巡检场景的当前形态。

Result: 通过在地下矿井中使用四足机器人的实际部署验证了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 所提出的分层框架能够在保持全局覆盖目标的同时，使局部自治对环境不确定性保持鲁棒性，从而完成巡检任务。

Abstract: In this work, we present a hierarchical framework designed to support robotic
inspection under environment uncertainty. By leveraging a known environment
model, existing methods plan and safely track inspection routes to visit points
of interest. However, discrepancies between the model and actual site
conditions, caused by either natural or human activities, can alter the surface
morphology or introduce path obstructions. To address this challenge, the
proposed framework divides the inspection task into: (a) generating the initial
global view-plan for region of interests based on a historical map and (b)
local view replanning to adapt to the current morphology of the inspection
scene. The proposed hierarchy preserves global coverage objectives while
enabling reactive adaptation to the local surface morphology. This enables the
local autonomy to remain robust against environment uncertainty and complete
the inspection tasks. We validate the approach through deployments in
real-world subterranean mines using quadrupedal robot.

*Hongxu Zhao,Guangyang Zeng,Yunling Shao,Tengfei Zhang,Junfeng Wu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一个统一迭代校准(UIC)框架，用于多传感器系统的外参和时间偏移联合估计，特别针对水下SLAM中的DVL传感器校准问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DVL校准方法局限于特定传感器配置或依赖过度简化假设，且无法同时估计平移外参和时间偏移，导致水下SLAM系统精度不足。

Method: 采用最大后验概率估计框架，结合高斯过程运动先验进行高保真运动插值，通过交替执行GP运动状态更新和梯度校准变量更新的迭代算法。

Result: UIC框架可应用于IMU、相机等多种传感器，开发了开源DVL-相机校准工具箱，仿真和真实世界测试验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该统一校准框架不仅适用于水下应用，其GP先验集成和可靠初始化程序的设计可广泛用于其他多传感器校准问题。

Abstract: The calibration of extrinsic parameters and clock offsets between sensors for
high-accuracy performance in underwater SLAM systems remains insufficiently
explored. Existing methods for Doppler Velocity Log (DVL) calibration are
either constrained to specific sensor configurations or rely on oversimplified
assumptions, and none jointly estimate translational extrinsics and time
offsets. We propose a Unified Iterative Calibration (UIC) framework for general
DVL sensor setups, formulated as a Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimation with a
Gaussian Process (GP) motion prior for high-fidelity motion interpolation. UIC
alternates between efficient GP-based motion state updates and gradient-based
calibration variable updates, supported by a provably statistically consistent
sequential initialization scheme. The proposed UIC can be applied to IMU,
cameras and other modalities as co-sensors. We release an open-source
DVL-camera calibration toolbox. Beyond underwater applications, several aspects
of UIC-such as the integration of GP priors for MAP-based calibration and the
design of provably reliable initialization procedures-are broadly applicable to
other multi-sensor calibration problems. Finally, simulations and real-world
tests validate our approach.

Method: 使用课程强化学习框架，分别训练垂直和水平跳跃策略；利用弹道运动定律稠密化稀疏奖励；采用参考状态初始化方案加速动态跳跃行为探索；结合行走策略实现多功能运动。

Result: 实验验证：水平跳跃达1.25米且厘米级精度，垂直跳跃达1.0米；在多种地形表面行走；性能超越先前工作；仅需少量修改即可学习全向跳跃。

Conclusion: 所提方法成功训练出精确高性能跳跃策略，有效跨越Sim2Real差距，展现出多功能动态运动能力，具有良好扩展性。

Abstract: This paper presents a curriculum-based reinforcement learning framework for
training precise and high-performance jumping policies for the robot `Olympus'.
Separate policies are developed for vertical and horizontal jumps, leveraging a
simple yet effective strategy. First, we densify the inherently sparse jumping
reward using the laws of projectile motion. Next, a reference state
initialization scheme is employed to accelerate the exploration of dynamic
jumping behaviors without reliance on reference trajectories. We also present a
walking policy that, when combined with the jumping policies, unlocks versatile
and dynamic locomotion capabilities. Comprehensive testing validates walking on
varied terrain surfaces and jumping performance that exceeds previous works,
effectively crossing the Sim2Real gap. Experimental validation demonstrates
horizontal jumps up to 1.25 m with centimeter accuracy and vertical jumps up to
1.0 m. Additionally, we show that with only minor modifications, the proposed
method can be used to learn omnidirectional jumping.

Abstract: In this letter, we introduce GroundLoc, a LiDAR-only localization pipeline
designed to localize a mobile robot in large-scale outdoor environments using
prior maps. GroundLoc employs a Bird's-Eye View (BEV) image projection focusing
on the perceived ground area and utilizes the place recognition network R2D2,
or alternatively, the non-learning approach Scale-Invariant Feature Transform
(SIFT), to identify and select keypoints for BEV image map registration. Our
results demonstrate that GroundLoc outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the
SemanticKITTI and HeLiPR datasets across various sensors. In the multi-session
localization evaluation, GroundLoc reaches an Average Trajectory Error (ATE)
well below 50 cm on all Ouster OS2 128 sequences while meeting online runtime
requirements. The system supports various sensor models, as evidenced by
evaluations conducted with Velodyne HDL-64E, Ouster OS2 128, Aeva Aeries II,
and Livox Avia sensors. The prior maps are stored as 2D raster image maps,
which can be created from a single drive and require only 4 MB of storage per
square kilometer. The source code is available at

Abstract: With the increasing integration of intelligent driving functions into
serial-produced vehicles, ensuring their functionality and robustness poses
greater challenges. Compared to traditional road testing, scenario-based
virtual testing offers significant advantages in terms of time and cost
efficiency, reproducibility, and exploration of edge cases. We propose a
Transformer-enhanced Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE-T) model for
generating multi-agent traffic scenarios in roundabouts, which are
characterized by high vehicle dynamics and complex layouts, yet remain
relatively underexplored in current research. The results show that the
proposed model can accurately reconstruct original scenarios and generate
realistic, diverse synthetic scenarios. Besides, two Key-Performance-Indicators
(KPIs) are employed to evaluate the interactive behavior in the generated
scenarios. Analysis of the latent space reveals partial disentanglement, with
several latent dimensions exhibiting distinct and interpretable effects on
scenario attributes such as vehicle entry timing, exit timing, and velocity
profiles. The results demonstrate the model's capability to generate scenarios
for the validation of intelligent driving functions involving multi-agent
interactions, as well as to augment data for their development and iterative
improvement.

Conclusion: 该方法能准确预测步态进展和关节角度，为动力型经股骨假肢的障碍物导航提供了重要的实用价值。

Abstract: For amputees with powered transfemoral prosthetics, navigating obstacles or
complex terrain remains challenging. This study addresses this issue by using
an inertial sensor on the sound ankle to guide obstacle-crossing movements. A
genetic algorithm computes the optimal neural network structure to predict the
required angles of the thigh and knee joints. A gait progression prediction
algorithm determines the actuation angle index for the prosthetic knee motor,
ultimately defining the necessary thigh and knee angles and gait progression.
Results show that when the standard deviation of Gaussian noise added to the
thigh angle data is less than 1, the method can effectively eliminate noise
interference, achieving 100\% accuracy in gait phase estimation under 150 Hz,
with thigh angle prediction error being 8.71\% and knee angle prediction error
being 6.78\%. These findings demonstrate the method's ability to accurately
predict gait progression and joint angles, offering significant practical value
for obstacle negotiation in powered transfemoral prosthetics.

Result: 真实世界实验表明，Fare能够在两种不同策略架构上实现故障恢复，在复杂环境中实现鲁棒的长距离导航。

Conclusion: Fare框架成功构建了故障恢复的模仿学习策略，提高了视觉导航在分布外场景中的鲁棒性。

Abstract: While imitation learning (IL) enables effective visual navigation, IL
policies are prone to unpredictable failures in out-of-distribution (OOD)
scenarios. We advance the notion of failure-resilient policies, which not only
detect failures but also recover from them automatically. Failure recognition
that identifies the factors causing failure is key to informing recovery: e.g.
pinpointing image regions triggering failure detections can provide cues to
guide recovery. We present Fare, a framework to construct failure-resilient IL
policies, embedding OOD-detection and recognition in them without using
explicit failure data, and pairing them with recovery heuristics. Real-world
experiments show that Fare enables failure recovery across two different policy
architectures, enabling robust long-range navigation in complex environments.

Abstract: Real-time control is an essential aspect of safe robot operation in the real
world with dynamic objects. We present a framework for the analysis of
object-aware controllers, methods for altering a robot's motion to anticipate
and avoid possible collisions. This framework is focused on three design
considerations: kinematics, motion profiles, and virtual constraints.
Additionally, the analysis in this work relies on verification of robot
behaviors using fundamental robot-obstacle experimental scenarios. To showcase
the effectiveness of our method we compare three representative object-aware
controllers. The comparison uses metrics originating from the design
considerations. From the analysis, we find that the design of object-aware
controllers often lacks kinematic considerations, continuity of control points,
and stability in movement profiles. We conclude that this framework can be used
in the future to design, compare, and benchmark obstacle avoidance methods.

Abstract: Softening and onboarding computers and controllers is one of the final
frontiers in soft robotics towards their robustness and intelligence for
everyday use. In this regard, embodying soft and physical computing presents
exciting potential. Physical computing seeks to encode inputs into a mechanical
computing kernel and leverage the internal interactions among this kernel's
constituent elements to compute the output. Moreover, such input-to-output
evolution can be re-programmable. This perspective paper proposes a framework
for embodying physical computing into soft robots and discusses three unique
strategies in the literature: analog oscillators, physical reservoir computing,
and physical algorithmic computing. These embodied computers enable the soft
robot to perform complex behaviors that would otherwise require CMOS-based
electronics -- including coordinated locomotion with obstacle avoidance,
payload weight and orientation classification, and programmable operation based
on logical rules. This paper will detail the working principles of these
embodied physical computing methods, survey the current state-of-the-art, and
present a perspective for future development.

Conclusion: 早期融合和更深层次的上下文建模在基于Transformer的多模态情感分析中具有显著优势

Abstract: Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA) seeks to understand human emotions by
jointly analyzing data from multiple modalities typically text and images
offering a richer and more accurate interpretation than unimodal approaches. In
this paper, we first propose BERT-ViT-EF, a novel model that combines powerful
Transformer-based encoders BERT for textual input and ViT for visual input
through an early fusion strategy. This approach facilitates deeper cross-modal
interactions and more effective joint representation learning. To further
enhance the model's capability, we propose an extension called the Dual
Transformer Contrastive Network (DTCN), which builds upon BERT-ViT-EF. DTCN
incorporates an additional Transformer encoder layer after BERT to refine
textual context (before fusion) and employs contrastive learning to align text
and image representations, fostering robust multimodal feature learning.
Empirical results on two widely used MSA benchmarks MVSA-Single and TumEmo
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. DTCN achieves best accuracy
(78.4%) and F1-score (78.3%) on TumEmo, and delivers competitive performance on
MVSA-Single, with 76.6% accuracy and 75.9% F1-score. These improvements
highlight the benefits of early fusion and deeper contextual modeling in
Transformer-based multimodal sentiment analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习力场虽然能提供精确的分子动力学模拟，但计算成本高昂。目前缺乏关于降低精度算术和GPU优化内核是否能减少成本而不损害物理保真度的系统证据。

Method: 对MACE进行端到端和逐块分析，比较e3nn和NVIDIA cuEquivariance后端，评估FP64/FP32/BF16/FP16设置（使用FP32累加）在推理、短NVT和长NPT水模拟以及玩具训练运行中的性能。

Result: cuEquivariance将推理延迟减少约3倍。在FP32模型中将线性层转换为BF16/FP16可获得约4倍额外加速，而NVT/NPT MD中的能量和热力学观测值保持在运行间变异性内。训练中的半精度权重会降低力RMSE。

Conclusion: 融合等变内核和混合精度推理可以显著加速最先进的力场，对下游MD影响可忽略。建议默认使用cuEquivariance和FP32，为线性层启用BF16/FP16（保持FP32累加）以获得最大吞吐量，而训练保持在FP32。

Abstract: Machine-learning force fields can deliver accurate molecular dynamics (MD) at
high computational cost. For SO(3)-equivariant models such as MACE, there is
little systematic evidence on whether reduced-precision arithmetic and
GPU-optimized kernels can cut this cost without harming physical fidelity. This
thesis aims to make MACE cheaper and faster while preserving accuracy by
identifying computational bottlenecks and evaluating low-precision execution
policies. We profile MACE end-to-end and per block, compare the e3nn and NVIDIA
cuEquivariance backends, and assess FP64/FP32/BF16/FP16 settings (with FP32
accumulation) for inference, short NVT and long NPT water simulations, and toy
training runs under reproducible, steady-state timing. cuEquivariance reduces
inference latency by about $3\times$. Casting only linear layers to BF16/FP16
within an FP32 model yields roughly 4x additional speedups, while energies and
thermodynamic observables in NVT/NPT MD remain within run-to-run variability.
Half-precision weights during training degrade force RMSE. Mixing e3nn and cuEq
modules without explicit adapters causes representation mismatches. Fused
equivariant kernels and mixed-precision inference can substantially accelerate
state-of-the-art force fields with negligible impact on downstream MD. A
practical policy is to use cuEquivariance with FP32 by default and enable
BF16/FP16 for linear layers (keeping FP32 accumulations) for maximum
throughput, while training remains in FP32. Further gains are expected on
Ampere/Hopper GPUs (TF32/BF16) and from kernel-level FP16/BF16 paths and
pipeline fusion.

*Alyssa Gerhart,Balaji Iyangar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了医疗AI系统中的对抗性攻击风险，通过在皮肤病数据集上的实验展示了攻击如何显著降低分类准确性，并评估了防御方法的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对抗性攻击对医疗AI系统构成严重威胁，可能导致危险的误分类，延误治疗或误诊，特别是在服务不足的人群中威胁患者安全。

Method: 通过威胁建模、实验基准测试和模型评估，在皮肤病数据集上进行实证实验，测试对抗性训练和蒸馏等防御方法。

Result: 防御方法降低了攻击成功率，但需要在攻击防御和干净数据上的模型性能之间取得平衡。

Conclusion: 需要整合技术、伦理和政策方法，构建更具弹性和公平性的医疗AI系统。

Abstract: Adversarial attacks pose a severe risk to AI systems used in healthcare,
capable of misleading models into dangerous misclassifications that can delay
treatments or cause misdiagnoses. These attacks, often imperceptible to human
perception, threaten patient safety, particularly in underserved populations.
Our study explores these vulnerabilities through empirical experimentation on a
dermatological dataset, where adversarial methods significantly reduce
classification accuracy. Through detailed threat modeling, experimental
benchmarking, and model evaluation, we demonstrate both the severity of the
threat and the partial success of defenses like adversarial training and
distillation. Our results show that while defenses reduce attack success rates,
they must be balanced against model performance on clean data. We conclude with
a call for integrated technical, ethical, and policy-based approaches to build
more resilient, equitable AI in healthcare.

*Tiago Mendonça dos Santos,Rafael Izbicki,Luís Gustavo Esteves*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了DiNo和RanBu两种浅层森林方法，通过将少量深度受限的树转换为高效的基于距离的预测器，显著降低了随机森林的推理延迟和内存需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随机森林在表格预测任务中表现优异，但依赖数百棵深树导致高推理延迟和内存需求，限制了在延迟敏感或资源受限环境中的部署。

Method: DiNo通过观测对的最远共同祖先测量同表型距离，RanBu对Breiman的经典邻近度测量应用核平滑。两种方法都在森林训练后完全操作，无需额外生长树，仅需轻量级矩阵向量操作调整单个带宽参数h。

Result: 在3个合成基准和25个公共数据集上，RanBu匹配或超过了全深度随机森林的准确性（特别是在高噪声设置中），同时将训练加推理时间减少高达95%。DiNo在低噪声机制中以适度的计算成本实现了最佳偏差-方差权衡。两种方法可直接扩展到分位数回归。

Conclusion: DiNo和RanBu是高效的浅层森林方法，能够在保持或提高准确性的同时显著降低计算成本，特别适用于延迟敏感和资源受限的环境。

Abstract: Random Forest ensembles are a strong baseline for tabular prediction tasks,
but their reliance on hundreds of deep trees often results in high inference
latency and memory demands, limiting deployment in latency-sensitive or
resource-constrained environments. We introduce DiNo (Distance with Nodes) and
RanBu (Random Bushes), two shallow-forest methods that convert a small set of
depth-limited trees into efficient, distance-weighted predictors. DiNo measures
cophenetic distances via the most recent common ancestor of observation pairs,
while RanBu applies kernel smoothing to Breiman's classical proximity measure.
Both approaches operate entirely after forest training: no additional trees are
grown, and tuning of the single bandwidth parameter $h$ requires only
lightweight matrix-vector operations. Across three synthetic benchmarks and 25
public datasets, RanBu matches or exceeds the accuracy of full-depth random
forests-particularly in high-noise settings-while reducing training plus
inference time by up to 95\%. DiNo achieves the best bias-variance trade-off in
low-noise regimes at a modest computational cost. Both methods extend directly
to quantile regression, maintaining accuracy with substantial speed gains. The
implementation is available as an open-source R/C++ package at
https://github.com/tiagomendonca/dirf. We focus on structured tabular random
samples (i.i.d.), leaving extensions to other modalities for future work.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个闭环LLM-知识图谱框架，将抑郁症检测与医学知识扩展相结合，通过迭代学习循环实现预测与知识的共同进化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究虽然整合医学知识来提高预测准确性，但忽视了通过预测过程同时扩展医学知识的机会。社交媒体用户生成内容为心理健康监测提供了实时数据源。

Method: 开发闭环LLM-知识图谱框架，包含两个阶段：知识感知的抑郁症检测阶段（LLM联合执行抑郁症检测和实体提取，知识图谱表示和加权实体以优化预测）和知识精炼与扩展阶段（LLM提取的新实体、关系和实体类型在专家监督下纳入知识图谱）。

Result: 使用大规模UGC数据，该框架同时提高了预测准确性和医学理解。专家评估确认发现了与现有文献互补的临床有意义症状、共病和社会触发因素。

Conclusion: 概念化和操作化了"通过预测学习"和"通过学习预测"作为相互强化的过程，推进了预测分析的方法论和理论理解，展示了计算模型和领域知识的共同进化。

Abstract: Social media user-generated content (UGC) provides real-time, self-reported
indicators of mental health conditions such as depression, offering a valuable
source for predictive analytics. While prior studies integrate medical
knowledge to improve prediction accuracy, they overlook the opportunity to
simultaneously expand such knowledge through predictive processes. We develop a
Closed-Loop Large Language Model (LLM)-Knowledge Graph framework that
integrates prediction and knowledge expansion in an iterative learning cycle.
In the knowledge-aware depression detection phase, the LLM jointly performs
depression detection and entity extraction, while the knowledge graph
represents and weights these entities to refine prediction performance. In the
knowledge refinement and expansion phase, new entities, relationships, and
entity types extracted by the LLM are incorporated into the knowledge graph
under expert supervision, enabling continual knowledge evolution. Using
large-scale UGC, the framework enhances both predictive accuracy and medical
understanding. Expert evaluations confirmed the discovery of clinically
meaningful symptoms, comorbidities, and social triggers complementary to
existing literature. We conceptualize and operationalize
prediction-through-learning and learning-through-prediction as mutually
reinforcing processes, advancing both methodological and theoretical
understanding in predictive analytics. The framework demonstrates the
co-evolution of computational models and domain knowledge, offering a
foundation for adaptive, data-driven knowledge systems applicable to other
dynamic risk monitoring contexts.

TL;DR: TracePile是一个包含260万样本的大规模语料库，将代码执行转化为显式的链式执行推理步骤，通过在数学、代码、逻辑和算法等20个基准测试上的实验，显著提升了多种基础模型的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决代码中推理过程通常隐含且与语法或实现噪声纠缠在一起，导致直接训练原始代码效果不佳的问题，需要将代码执行转化为显式的推理步骤。

Method: 构建TracePile语料库，将代码执行转化为链式执行推理步骤，包含变量追踪问题和代码重写以增强逻辑粒度和代码多样性，采用三种训练设置：继续预训练、预训练后指令调优和两阶段微调。

Result: 在四个基础模型和20个基准测试上均表现出持续改进，特别是LLaMA3.1-8B在九个数学数据集上平均提升7.1%，在两阶段微调下在LiveCodeBench、CRUX和MMLU上也有明显提升。

Conclusion: TracePile通过将代码执行转化为显式推理步骤，有效提升了语言模型的推理能力，证明了这种方法在构建强大通用推理能力方面的价值。

Abstract: Building robust and general reasoning ability is a central goal in the
development of large language models (LLMs). Recent efforts increasingly turn
to code as a rich training source, given its inherent logical structure and
diverse reasoning paradigms such as divide-and-conquer, topological ordering,
and enumeration. However, reasoning in code is often expressed implicitly and
entangled with syntactic or implementation noise, making direct training on raw
code suboptimal.To address this, we introduce TracePile, a large-scale corpus
of 2.6 million samples that transforms code execution into explicit,
step-by-step chain-of-thought-style rationales, which we call Chain of
Execution (CoE). The corpus spans domains including mathematics, classical
algorithms and algorithmic competition, and is enriched with variable-tracing
questions and code rewritings to enhance logical granularity and code
diversity. We evaluate TracePile using three training setups:
continue-pretraining, instruction tuning after pretraining, and two-stage
finetuning. Experiments across four base models (LLaMA 3, LLaMA 3.1, Qwen-2.5,
and Qwen-2.5 Coder) and 20 benchmarks covering math, code, logic, and
algorithms demonstrate consistent improvements. Notably, TracePile boosts
LLaMA3.1-8B by 7.1\% on average across nine math datasets and delivers clear
gains on LiveCodeBench, CRUX, and MMLU under two-stage fine-tuning.

TL;DR: 提出了数字到事件推理与解码任务，通过推理感知框架从数值输入中推断可解释的结构化事件，解决了LLMs在纯数值时间序列理解上的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注预测或趋势描述，未能揭示驱动数值变化的潜在事件或解释其推理过程。LLMs对纯数值时间序列信号的理解仍然有限。

Method: 提出推理感知框架，整合代理引导的事件提取器(AGE)、标记多元Hawkes合成生成器(EveDTS)，以及结合时间序列编码器和结构化解码器的两阶段微调流水线。

Result: 在多领域数据集上的实验表明，该方法在事件级精度和召回率方面显著优于强大的LLM基线。

Conclusion: 为连接定量推理和语义理解开辟了新方向，使LLMs能够直接从数值动态中解释和预测事件。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated impressive multimodal
reasoning capabilities, yet their understanding of purely numerical time-series
signals remains limited. Existing approaches mainly focus on forecasting or
trend description, without uncovering the latent events that drive numerical
changes or explaining the reasoning process behind them. In this work, we
introduce the task of number-to-event reasoning and decoding, which aims to
infer interpretable structured events from numerical inputs, even when current
text is unavailable. To address the data scarcity and semantic alignment
challenges, we propose a reasoning-aware framework that integrates an
agent-guided event extractor (AGE), a marked multivariate Hawkes-based
synthetic generator (EveDTS), and a two-stage fine-tuning pipeline combining a
time-series encoder with a structured decoder. Our model explicitly reasons
over numerical changes, generates intermediate explanations, and outputs
structured event hypotheses. Experiments on multi-domain datasets show that our
method substantially outperforms strong LLM baselines in event-level precision
and recall. These results suggest a new direction for bridging quantitative
reasoning and semantic understanding, enabling LLMs to explain and predict
events directly from numerical dynamics.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Ranked Choice Preference Optimization (RCPO)框架，通过最大似然估计将偏好优化与排序选择建模相结合，支持多种人类反馈格式，在多个基准测试中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型对齐主要依赖成对偏好优化，忽略了从更丰富的人类反馈（如多选比较和top-k排序）中学习的机会。

Method: 提出RCPO统一框架，支持基于效用和基于排序的选择模型，包含Multinomial Logit和Mallows-RMJ等代表性排序选择模型。

Result: 在Llama-3-8B-Instruct和Gemma-2-9B-it模型上的实证研究表明，RCPO在AlpacaEval 2和Arena-Hard基准测试中持续优于竞争基线。

Conclusion: RCPO展示了直接利用排序偏好数据结合合适的选择模型能够实现更有效的对齐，为将排序选择建模融入LLM训练提供了灵活可扩展的基础。

Abstract: Alignment of large language models (LLMs) has predominantly relied on
pairwise preference optimization, where annotators select the better of two
responses to a prompt. While simple, this approach overlooks the opportunity to
learn from richer forms of human feedback, such as multiwise comparisons and
top-$k$ rankings. We propose Ranked Choice Preference Optimization (RCPO), a
unified framework that bridges preference optimization with (ranked) choice
modeling via maximum likelihood estimation. The framework is flexible,
supporting both utility-based and rank-based choice models. It subsumes several
existing pairwise methods (e.g., DPO, SimPO), while providing principled
training objectives for richer feedback formats. We instantiate this framework
with two representative ranked choice models (Multinomial Logit and
Mallows-RMJ). Empirical studies on Llama-3-8B-Instruct and Gemma-2-9B-it across
AlpacaEval 2 and Arena-Hard benchmarks show that RCPO consistently outperforms
competitive baselines. RCPO shows how directly leveraging ranked preference
data, combined with the right choice models, yields more effective alignment.
It offers a versatile and extensible foundation for incorporating (ranked)
choice modeling into LLM training.

TL;DR: LLMCOMP是一种基于解码器大型语言模型的科学数据有损压缩方法，通过量化、Z-order曲线和覆盖引导采样处理3D场数据，在严格误差约束下实现比现有方法高30%的压缩比。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高分辨率科学模拟和观测系统产生海量时空数据，需要高效的有界误差压缩方法。同时，解码器大型语言模型在建模复杂序列数据方面展现出强大能力。

Method: 将3D场量化为离散标记，通过Z-order曲线排列保持局部性，应用覆盖引导采样提高训练效率，训练自回归transformer建模标记转移，压缩时使用top-k预测存储排名索引和回退校正。

Result: 在多个再分析数据集上的实验表明，LLMCOMP在严格误差约束下持续优于最先进的压缩器，压缩比提高达30%。

Conclusion: 这些结果突显了LLMs作为高保真科学数据通用压缩器的潜力。

Abstract: The rapid growth of high-resolution scientific simulations and observation
systems is generating massive spatiotemporal datasets, making efficient,
error-bounded compression increasingly important. Meanwhile, decoder-only large
language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in modeling
complex sequential data. In this paper, we propose LLMCOMP, a novel lossy
compression paradigm that leverages decoder-only large LLMs to model scientific
data. LLMCOMP first quantizes 3D fields into discrete tokens, arranges them via
Z-order curves to preserve locality, and applies coverage-guided sampling to
enhance training efficiency. An autoregressive transformer is then trained with
spatial-temporal embeddings to model token transitions. During compression, the
model performs top-k prediction, storing only rank indices and fallback
corrections to ensure strict error bounds. Experiments on multiple reanalysis
datasets show that LLMCOMP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
compressors, achieving up to 30% higher compression ratios under strict error
bounds. These results highlight the potential of LLMs as general-purpose
compressors for high-fidelity scientific data.

Motivation: 现有预训练扩散模型在零样本逆问题求解中存在两难困境：过度整合观测信息会破坏生成过程，而整合不足则无法有效强调逆问题约束。

Method: 提出噪声组合采样方法，从噪声子空间合成最优噪声向量来近似测量分数，替代标准DDPM过程中的噪声项，实现条件信息的自然嵌入。

Result: 该方法适用于多种逆问题求解器，特别是在生成步数T较小时，能以可忽略的计算开销实现优越性能。

Conclusion: Noise Combination Sampling方法有效解决了扩散模型在逆问题求解中的整合困境，显著提升了方法的鲁棒性和稳定性。

Abstract: Pretrained diffusion models have demonstrated strong capabilities in
zero-shot inverse problem solving by incorporating observation information into
the generation process of the diffusion models. However, this presents an
inherent dilemma: excessive integration can disrupt the generative process,
while insufficient integration fails to emphasize the constraints imposed by
the inverse problem. To address this, we propose \emph{Noise Combination
Sampling}, a novel method that synthesizes an optimal noise vector from a noise
subspace to approximate the measurement score, replacing the noise term in the
standard Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models process. This enables
conditional information to be naturally embedded into the generation process
without reliance on step-wise hyperparameter tuning. Our method can be applied
to a wide range of inverse problem solvers, including image compression, and,
particularly when the number of generation steps $T$ is small, achieves
superior performance with negligible computational overhead, significantly
improving robustness and stability.

Conclusion: MAS函数可用于构建通用单调模型，近似所有单调集合函数，提出的弱MAS模型在实践中表现良好。

Abstract: Motivated by applications for set containment problems, we consider the
following fundamental problem: can we design set-to-vector functions so that
the natural partial order on sets is preserved, namely $S\subseteq T \text{ if
and only if } F(S)\leq F(T) $. We call functions satisfying this property
Monotone and Separating (MAS) set functions. % We establish lower and upper
bounds for the vector dimension necessary to obtain MAS functions, as a
function of the cardinality of the multisets and the underlying ground set. In
the important case of an infinite ground set, we show that MAS functions do not
exist, but provide a model called our which provably enjoys a relaxed MAS
property we name "weakly MAS" and is stable in the sense of Holder continuity.
We also show that MAS functions can be used to construct universal models that
are monotone by construction and can approximate all monotone set functions.
Experimentally, we consider a variety of set containment tasks. The experiments
show the benefit of using our our model, in comparison with standard set models
which do not incorporate set containment as an inductive bias. Our code is
available in https://github.com/yonatansverdlov/Monotone-Embedding.

Conclusion: 在真实用户环境中SKEL显示出减少标注工作和提高数据质量的潜力，但需要仔细平衡用户参与度与数据质量要求。

Abstract: Any digital personal assistant, whether used to support task performance,
answer questions, or manage work and daily life, including fitness schedules,
requires high-quality annotations to function properly. However, user
annotations, whether actively produced or inferred from context (e.g., data
from smartphone sensors), are often subject to errors and noise. Previous
research on Skeptical Learning (SKEL) addressed the issue of noisy labels by
comparing offline active annotations with passive data, allowing for an
evaluation of annotation accuracy. However, this evaluation did not include
confirmation from end-users, the best judges of their own context. In this
study, we evaluate SKEL's performance in real-world conditions with actual
users who can refine the input labels based on their current perspectives and
needs. The study involves university students using the iLog mobile application
on their devices over a period of four weeks. The results highlight the
challenges of finding the right balance between user effort and data quality,
as well as the potential benefits of using SKEL, which include reduced
annotation effort and improved quality of collected data.

Abstract: Flight delay prediction has become a key focus in air traffic management, as
delays highlight inefficiencies that impact overall network performance. This
paper presents a lightweight large language model-based multimodal flight delay
prediction, formulated from the perspective of air traffic controllers
monitoring aircraft delay after entering the terminal area. The approach
integrates trajectory representations with textual aeronautical information,
including flight information, weather reports, and aerodrome notices, by
adapting trajectory data into the language modality to capture airspace
conditions. Experimental results show that the model consistently achieves
sub-minute prediction error by effectively leveraging contextual information
related to the sources of delay. The framework demonstrates that linguistic
understanding, when combined with cross-modality adaptation of trajectory
information, enhances delay prediction. Moreover, the approach shows
practicality and scalability for real-world operations, supporting real-time
updates that refine predictions upon receiving new operational information.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多模态分子模型中3D构象不可靠性和模态崩溃问题，提升模型的鲁棒性和泛化能力

Method: 设计结构化融合管道(SFP)结合2D拓扑和3D几何信息，采用渐进注入(PI)机制非对称地整合结构先验到序列流中，基于状态空间骨干网络

Result: 在29个基准任务中平均提升2.7%，在22个任务中排名第一，LD50任务提升27%，验证了对3D构象噪声的鲁棒性和多模态融合的有效性

Conclusion: MuMo框架有效解决了分子表示中的多模态融合挑战，在多个基准任务上取得了显著性能提升

Abstract: Multimodal molecular models often suffer from 3D conformer unreliability and
modality collapse, limiting their robustness and generalization. We propose
MuMo, a structured multimodal fusion framework that addresses these challenges
in molecular representation through two key strategies. To reduce the
instability of conformer-dependent fusion, we design a Structured Fusion
Pipeline (SFP) that combines 2D topology and 3D geometry into a unified and
stable structural prior. To mitigate modality collapse caused by naive fusion,
we introduce a Progressive Injection (PI) mechanism that asymmetrically
integrates this prior into the sequence stream, preserving modality-specific
modeling while enabling cross-modal enrichment. Built on a state space
backbone, MuMo supports long-range dependency modeling and robust information
propagation. Across 29 benchmark tasks from Therapeutics Data Commons (TDC) and
MoleculeNet, MuMo achieves an average improvement of 2.7% over the
best-performing baseline on each task, ranking first on 22 of them, including a
27% improvement on the LD50 task. These results validate its robustness to 3D
conformer noise and the effectiveness of multimodal fusion in molecular
representation. The code is available at: github.com/selmiss/MuMo.

TL;DR: 提出SAL-T（空间感知线性Transformer），通过物理启发的空间分区和卷积层，在保持线性注意力的同时实现与全注意力Transformer相当的性能，显著降低资源消耗和推理延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer在高能粒子碰撞中能有效捕捉全局和局部相关性，但其二次复杂度在CERN LHC等高数据吞吐量环境中存在部署挑战，需要大量资源且增加推理延迟。

Method: 基于linformer架构，引入物理启发的空间感知粒子分区（基于运动学特征），计算物理意义区域间的注意力，并使用卷积层捕捉局部相关性（借鉴喷注物理的见解）。

Result: 在喷注分类任务中优于标准linformer，同时达到与全注意力Transformer相当的分类结果，但使用更少资源且推理延迟更低。在ModelNet10点云分类数据集上也验证了这一趋势。

Conclusion: SAL-T通过物理启发的空间分区和局部相关性捕捉，在保持高性能的同时显著降低了Transformer的计算复杂度和资源需求，适用于高数据吞吐量环境。

Abstract: Transformers are very effective in capturing both global and local
correlations within high-energy particle collisions, but they present
deployment challenges in high-data-throughput environments, such as the CERN
LHC. The quadratic complexity of transformer models demands substantial
resources and increases latency during inference. In order to address these
issues, we introduce the Spatially Aware Linear Transformer (SAL-T), a
physics-inspired enhancement of the linformer architecture that maintains
linear attention. Our method incorporates spatially aware partitioning of
particles based on kinematic features, thereby computing attention between
regions of physical significance. Additionally, we employ convolutional layers
to capture local correlations, informed by insights from jet physics. In
addition to outperforming the standard linformer in jet classification tasks,
SAL-T also achieves classification results comparable to full-attention
transformers, while using considerably fewer resources with lower latency
during inference. Experiments on a generic point cloud classification dataset
(ModelNet10) further confirm this trend. Our code is available at
https://github.com/aaronw5/SAL-T4HEP.

TL;DR: LRQK是一个两阶段框架，通过低秩分解查询和键矩阵来减少KV缓存的内存占用，同时保持注意力输出的精确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着输入文本长度增加，LLMs中的KV缓存导致GPU内存成本过高，限制了在资源受限设备上的长上下文推理。现有方法如KV量化和剪枝会损失数值精度或保留次优的键值对。

Method: 在预填充阶段将全精度查询和键矩阵分解为紧凑的秩-r因子，然后在每个解码步骤使用这些低维投影计算代理注意力分数。采用混合GPU-CPU缓存和命中-未命中机制，仅传输缺失的全精度KV对。

Result: 在RULER和LongBench基准测试中，LRQK在长上下文设置中匹配或超越了领先的稀疏注意力方法，同时显著节省内存且精度损失最小。

Conclusion: LRQK提供了一种有效的解决方案，在保持精确注意力输出的同时大幅减少KV缓存的内存占用，适用于资源受限环境中的长上下文推理。

Abstract: As the length of input text grows, the key-value (KV) cache in LLMs imposes
prohibitive GPU memory costs and limits long-context inference on resource
constrained devices. Existing approaches, such as KV quantization and pruning,
reduce memory usage but suffer from numerical precision loss or suboptimal
retention of key-value pairs. We introduce Low Rank Query and Key attention
(LRQK), a two-stage framework that jointly decomposes the full-precision query
and key matrices into compact rank-\(r\) factors during the prefill stage, and
then uses these low-dimensional projections to compute proxy attention scores
in \(\mathcal{O}(lr)\) time at each decode step. By selecting only the
top-\(k\) tokens and a small fixed set of recent tokens, LRQK employs a mixed
GPU-CPU cache with a hit-and-miss mechanism that transfers only missing
full-precision KV pairs, thereby preserving exact attention outputs while
reducing CPU-GPU data movement. Extensive experiments on the RULER and
LongBench benchmarks with LLaMA-3-8B and Qwen2.5-7B demonstrate that LRQK
matches or surpasses leading sparse-attention methods in long context settings,
while delivering significant memory savings with minimal loss in accuracy. Our
code is available at https://github.com/tenghuilee/LRQK.

TL;DR: CLP是一个连续层剪枝框架，通过可微凹门算法自动识别最佳剪枝层段，并使用截止端点调优策略恢复性能，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在资源受限的边缘设备上部署面临挑战，现有层剪枝方法依赖手工指标且忽略层间依赖关系，会破坏信息流并严重降低性能。

Method: 提出连续层剪枝框架CLP，包含可微凹门算法自动识别最佳剪枝层段，以及截止端点调优策略微调剪枝段相邻层来恢复性能。

Result: 在多种模型架构和规模上的实验表明，CLP显著优于现有基线方法。在20%剪枝率下，LLaMA3-70B平均性能保持率达到95.34%，比基线高出4.29%-30.52%。

Conclusion: CLP能有效减少大语言模型的计算开销，且可与量化技术结合进一步压缩模型，仅带来轻微性能损失。

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) have achieved revolutionary
breakthroughs in many fields, their large model size and high computational
cost pose significant challenges for practical deployment on
resource-constrained edge devices. To this end, layer pruning has been proposed
to reduce the computational overhead by directly removing redundant layers.
However, existing layer pruning methods typically rely on hand-crafted metrics
to evaluate and remove individual layers, while ignoring the dependencies
between layers. This can disrupt the model's information flow and severely
degrade performance. To address these issues, we propose CLP, a novel
continuous layer pruning framework that introduces two key innovations: a
differentiable concave gate algorithm that automatically identifies the best
continuous layer segments for pruning via gradient-based optimization; and a
cutoff endpoint tuning strategy that effectively restores model performance by
fine-tuning only the layers adjacent to the pruned segments. Extensive
experiments across multiple model architectures (including LLaMA2, LLaMA3 and
Qwen) and sizes (from $7$B to $70$B parameters) show that CLP significantly
outperforms existing state-of-the-art baselines. For example, at a pruning rate
of $20\%$, CLP achieves an average performance retention of $95.34\%$ on
LLaMA3-70B, outperforming baselines by $4.29\%$-$30.52\%$. Furthermore, CLP can
be seamlessly combined with quantization to further compress the model with
only a slight performance loss.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习交通预测模型假设预测误差在时间和空间上不相关，但实际上由于交通数据的时空特性，误差存在自相关性，这一假设限制了模型性能。

Method: SAEA框架将预测误差建模为时空向量自回归过程，通过系数矩阵捕获时空误差相关性，引入结构稀疏正则化融入先验空间信息，并设计测试时误差调整机制动态优化预测。

Result: 在多个交通数据集上的实验表明，该方法能显著提升各种交通预测模型的性能，在几乎所有情况下都表现出改进效果。

Conclusion: SAEA框架通过系统调整时空自相关预测误差，有效解决了现有交通预测模型忽略误差相关性的问题，为深度学习交通预测提供了新的优化思路。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) play a significant role in an increasing body of
research on traffic forecasting due to their effectively capturing
spatiotemporal patterns embedded in traffic data. A general assumption of
training the said forecasting models via mean squared error estimation is that
the errors across time steps and spatial positions are uncorrelated. However,
this assumption does not really hold because of the autocorrelation caused by
both the temporality and spatiality of traffic data. This gap limits the
performance of DNN-based forecasting models and is overlooked by current
studies. To fill up this gap, this paper proposes Spatiotemporally
Autocorrelated Error Adjustment (SAEA), a novel and general framework designed
to systematically adjust autocorrelated prediction errors in traffic
forecasting. Unlike existing approaches that assume prediction errors follow a
random Gaussian noise distribution, SAEA models these errors as a
spatiotemporal vector autoregressive (VAR) process to capture their intrinsic
dependencies. First, it explicitly captures both spatial and temporal error
correlations by a coefficient matrix, which is then embedded into a newly
formulated cost function. Second, a structurally sparse regularization is
introduced to incorporate prior spatial information, ensuring that the learned
coefficient matrix aligns with the inherent road network structure. Finally, an
inference process with test-time error adjustment is designed to dynamically
refine predictions, mitigating the impact of autocorrelated errors in real-time
forecasting. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is verified on
different traffic datasets. Results across a wide range of traffic forecasting
models show that our method enhances performance in almost all cases.

Motivation: 冷等离子体是一种环保的促进种子发芽的方法，但由于复杂的种子-等离子体-环境相互作用，结果难以预测，需要开发可靠的预测模型。

Method: 使用介电阻挡放电等离子体处理大豆、大麦、向日葵、萝卜和番茄种子，测试了梯度提升、极端梯度提升、Extra Trees及其混合模型，并采用特征降维优化模型性能。

Result: Extra Trees模型表现最佳（R²=0.919；RMSE=3.21；MAE=2.62），特征降维后进一步提升至R²=0.925。发现激素效应：7-15kV、200-500s处理效果最佳，放电功率≥100W配合短时间暴露效果最好。不同物种和品种预测精度存在差异。

Conclusion: 该机器学习框架成功预测了冷等离子体处理对种子发芽的提升效果，并集成到MLflow中，为精准农业中的种子处理优化提供了决策支持工具。

Abstract: Cold plasma (CP) is an eco-friendly method to enhance seed germination, yet
outcomes remain difficult to predict due to complex seed--plasma--environment
interactions. This study introduces the first machine learning framework to
forecast germination uplift in soybean, barley, sunflower, radish, and tomato
under dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma. Among the models tested (GB,
XGB, ET, and hybrids), Extra Trees (ET) performed best (R\textsuperscript{2} =
0.919; RMSE = 3.21; MAE = 2.62), improving to R\textsuperscript{2} = 0.925
after feature reduction. Engineering analysis revealed a hormetic response:
negligible effects at $<$7 kV or $<$200 s, maximum germination at 7--15 kV for
200--500 s, and reduced germination beyond 20 kV or prolonged exposures.
Discharge power was also a dominant factor, with germination rate maximizing at
$\geq$100 W with low exposure time. Species and cultivar-level predictions
showed radish (MAE = 1.46) and soybean (MAE = 2.05) were modeled with high
consistency, while sunflower remained slightly higher variable (MAE = 3.80).
Among cultivars, Williams (MAE = 1.23) and Sari (1.33) were well predicted,
while Arian (2.86) and Ny\'{\i}rs\'{e}gi fekete (3.74) were comparatively
poorly captured. This framework was also embedded into MLflow, providing a
decision-support tool for optimizing CP seed germination in precision
agriculture.

TL;DR: ELBO-KTO结合ELBO替代扩散对数似然与KTO非配对偏好目标，为扩散语言模型提供了一种无需配对偏好数据的对齐方法，在多个基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散语言模型的对齐面临序列对数似然难以计算和配对偏好数据收集成本高的问题，需要开发更高效的优化方法。

Method: 使用ELBO作为扩散对数似然的替代，结合基于前景理论的非配对偏好优化目标KTO，并采用方差减少技术稳定训练梯度。

Result: 在LLaDA-8B-Instruct上，ELBO-KTO在kto-mix-14k和UltraFeedback-Binary上分别达到65.9%和62.3%的调整胜率，在GSM8K、MMLU等下游任务中表现优于或持平基础模型。

Conclusion: ELBO-KTO证明了非配对偏好优化是扩散语言模型中配对对齐的可行替代方案。

Abstract: Diffusion language models (dLLMs) are an emerging alternative to
autoregressive (AR) generators, but aligning them to human preferences is
challenging because sequence log-likelihoods are intractable and pairwise
preference data are costly to collect. We introduce ELBO-KTO, which combines an
ELBO surrogate for diffusion log-likelihoods with a prospect-theoretic,
unpaired preference objective (Kahneman Tversky Optimization, KTO). We analyze
the bias and variance induced by the ELBO substitution and employ
variance-reduction practices that stabilize gradients during training. Applied
to LLaDA-8B-Instruct, ELBO-KTO yields \textbf{65.9\%} and \textbf{62.3\%}
adjusted win rates on kto-mix-14k and UltraFeedback-Binary, respectively,
versus the base model under an automatic LLM judge. Across downstream tasks,
including GSM8K, MMLU, and additional reasoning/knowledge benchmarks, ELBO-KTO
trained on UltraFeedback-Binary performs on par with or better than the base
model under identical decoding. This establishes unpaired preference
optimization as a viable alternative to pairwise alignment in diffusion LLMs.

Abstract: Recently, there has been growing attention on combining quantum machine
learning (QML) with classical deep learning approaches, as computational
techniques are key to improving the performance of image classification tasks.
This study presents a hybrid approach that uses ResNet-50 (Residual Network)
for feature extraction and Quantum Support Vector Machines (QSVM) for
classification in the context of potato disease detection. Classical machine
learning as well as deep learning models often struggle with high-dimensional
and complex datasets, necessitating advanced techniques like quantum computing
to improve classification efficiency. In our research, we use ResNet-50 to
extract deep feature representations from RGB images of potato diseases. These
features are then subjected to dimensionality reduction using Principal
Component Analysis (PCA). The resulting features are processed through QSVM
models which apply various quantum feature maps such as ZZ, Z, and Pauli-X to
transform classical data into quantum states. To assess the model performance,
we compared it with classical machine learning algorithms such as Support
Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) using five-fold stratified
cross-validation for comprehensive evaluation. The experimental results
demonstrate that the Z-feature map-based QSVM outperforms classical models,
achieving an accuracy of 99.23 percent, surpassing both SVM and RF models. This
research highlights the advantages of integrating quantum computing into image
classification and provides a potential disease detection solution through
hybrid quantum-classical modeling.

Abstract: Pneumonia poses a significant global health challenge, demanding accurate and
timely diagnosis. While deep learning, particularly Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs), has shown promise in medical image analysis for pneumonia
detection, CNNs often suffer from high computational costs, limitations in
feature representation, and challenges in generalizing from smaller datasets.
To address these limitations, we explore the application of Quanvolutional
Neural Networks (QNNs), leveraging quantum computing for enhanced feature
extraction. This paper introduces a novel hybrid quantum-classical model for
pneumonia detection using the PneumoniaMNIST dataset. Our approach utilizes a
quanvolutional layer with a parameterized quantum circuit (PQC) to process 2x2
image patches, employing rotational Y-gates for data encoding and entangling
layers to generate non-classical feature representations. These
quantum-extracted features are then fed into a classical neural network for
classification. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed QNN achieves
a higher validation accuracy of 83.33 percent compared to a comparable
classical CNN which achieves 73.33 percent. This enhanced convergence and
sample efficiency highlight the potential of QNNs for medical image analysis,
particularly in scenarios with limited labeled data. This research lays the
foundation for integrating quantum computing into deep-learning-driven medical
diagnostic systems, offering a computationally efficient alternative to
traditional approaches.

Abstract: Accurate mapping of column-averaged CO2 (XCO2) over agricultural landscapes
is essential for guiding emission mitigation strategies. We present a
Spatiotemporal Vision Transformer with Wavelets (ST-ViWT) framework that
reconstructs continuous, uncertainty-quantified XCO2 fields from OCO-2 across
southern Canada, emphasizing poultry-intensive regions. The model fuses wavelet
time-frequency representations with transformer attention over meteorology,
vegetation indices, topography, and land cover. On 2024 OCO-2 data, ST-ViWT
attains R2 = 0.984 and RMSE = 0.468 ppm; 92.3 percent of gap-filled predictions
lie within +/-1 ppm. Independent validation with TCCON shows robust
generalization (bias = -0.14 ppm; r = 0.928), including faithful reproduction
of the late-summer drawdown. Spatial analysis across 14 poultry regions reveals
a moderate positive association between facility density and XCO2 (r = 0.43);
high-density areas exhibit larger seasonal amplitudes (9.57 ppm) and enhanced
summer variability. Compared with conventional interpolation and standard
machine-learning baselines, ST-ViWT yields seamless 0.25 degree CO2 surfaces
with explicit uncertainties, enabling year-round coverage despite sparse
observations. The approach supports integration of satellite constraints with
national inventories and precision livestock platforms to benchmark emissions,
refine region-specific factors, and verify interventions. Importantly,
transformer-based Earth observation enables scalable, transparent, spatially
explicit carbon accounting, hotspot prioritization, and policy-relevant
mitigation assessment.

Motivation: 压缩文件格式是高效数据存储和传输的基础，但其在表示学习方面的潜力尚未被充分探索。现有方法通常需要处理原始字节或完全解码媒体数据，计算复杂度和内存使用较高。

Method: 利用压缩文件的固有字节流结构设计有效的标记化和编码策略，通过这种紧凑编码使标准transformer能够直接从压缩数据流学习语义表示，绕过原始字节级处理或完整媒体解码的需求。

Abstract: Compressed file formats are the corner stone of efficient data storage and
transmission, yet their potential for representation learning remains largely
underexplored. We introduce TEMPEST (TransformErs froM comPressed

compressed files to design an effective tokenization and encoding strategy. By
leveraging this compact encoding, a standard transformer can directly learn
semantic representations from compressed data streams, bypassing the need for
raw byte-level processing or full media decoding. Our proposal substantially
reduces the number of tokens required for semantic classification, thereby
lowering both computational complexity and memory usage. Through extensive
experiments across diverse datasets, coding schemes, and modalities, we show
that TEMPEST achieves accuracy competitive wit the state-of-the-art while
delivering efficiency gains in memory and compute.

Motivation: 现有深度学习方法局限于固定方形网格、少量手动编码的边界条件和后处理优化，无法实现通用部署。需要开发一个能够处理任意边界条件、分辨率和长宽比的通用拓扑优化框架。

Conclusion: OAT建立了一个通用、快速且分辨率无关的物理感知拓扑优化框架，并为生成建模在逆向设计中的研究提供了大规模数据集。

Abstract: Structural topology optimization (TO) is central to engineering design but
remains computationally intensive due to complex physics and hard constraints.
Existing deep-learning methods are limited to fixed square grids, a few
hand-coded boundary conditions, and post-hoc optimization, preventing general
deployment. We introduce Optimize Any Topology (OAT), a foundation-model
framework that directly predicts minimum-compliance layouts for arbitrary
aspect ratios, resolutions, volume fractions, loads, and fixtures. OAT combines
a resolution- and shape-agnostic autoencoder with an implicit neural-field
decoder and a conditional latent-diffusion model trained on OpenTO, a new
corpus of 2.2 million optimized structures covering 2 million unique
boundary-condition configurations. On four public benchmarks and two
challenging unseen tests, OAT lowers mean compliance up to 90% relative to the
best prior models and delivers sub-1 second inference on a single GPU across
resolutions from 64 x 64 to 256 x 256 and aspect ratios as high as 10:1. These
results establish OAT as a general, fast, and resolution-free framework for

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于STL分解的混合预测框架，将交通流量分解为趋势、季节性和残差分量，分别用LSTM、ARIMA和XGBoost模型预测，通过乘法集成获得最终预测结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单一模型难以捕捉交通流量数据中复杂的非线性多尺度时间模式，需要更有效的预测方法。

Method: 使用STL分解时间序列为趋势、季节性和残差分量，分别用LSTM建模长期趋势、ARIMA捕捉季节性周期、XGBoost预测非线性残差波动，最后通过乘法集成子模型预测。

Result: 在纽约市交叉口的998条交通流量记录上测试，LSTM-ARIMA-XGBoost混合模型在MAE、RMSE和R平方指标上显著优于单独的LSTM、ARIMA和XGBoost模型。

Conclusion: 分解策略有效分离了时间特征，使各模型能够专业化，从而提高了预测准确性、可解释性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Accurate traffic flow forecasting is essential for intelligent transportation
systems and urban traffic management. However, single model approaches often
fail to capture the complex, nonlinear, and multi scale temporal patterns in
traffic flow data. This study proposes a decomposition driven hybrid framework
that integrates Seasonal Trend decomposition using Loess (STL) with three
complementary predictive models. STL first decomposes the original time series
into trend, seasonal, and residual components. Then, a Long Short Term Memory
(LSTM) network models long term trends, an Autoregressive Integrated Moving
Average (ARIMA) model captures seasonal periodicity, and an Extreme Gradient
Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm predicts nonlinear residual fluctuations. The
final forecast is obtained through multiplicative integration of the sub model
predictions. Using 998 traffic flow records from a New York City intersection
between November and December 2015, results show that the LSTM ARIMA XGBoost
hybrid model significantly outperforms standalone models including LSTM, ARIMA,
and XGBoost across MAE, RMSE, and R squared metrics. The decomposition strategy
effectively isolates temporal characteristics, allowing each model to
specialize, thereby improving prediction accuracy, interpretability, and
robustness.

*Marmik Chaudhari,Jeremi Nuer,Rome Thorstenson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文研究了混合专家(MoE)模型与密集网络在机制上的差异，发现网络稀疏性（活跃专家比例）是理解MoE模型的关键因素，而非特征稀疏性或重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解MoE模型与密集网络在机制上的根本差异，探索MoE模型如何实现特征表示和专家专业化。

Method: 开发了新的度量方法来测量专家间的叠加现象，分析了网络稀疏性对模型行为的影响，并提出了基于单语义特征表示的专家专业化新定义。

Result: 发现网络稀疏性更高的模型表现出更强的单语义性，专家在适当初始化时会自然地围绕连贯的特征组合组织。

Conclusion: MoE模型中的网络稀疏性可能在不牺牲性能的情况下实现更可解释的模型，挑战了可解释性与能力之间存在根本冲突的常见假设。

Abstract: Mixture of Experts (MoE) models have become central to scaling large language
models, yet their mechanistic differences from dense networks remain poorly
understood. Previous work has explored how dense models use
\textit{superposition} to represent more features than dimensions, and how
superposition is a function of feature sparsity and feature importance. MoE
models cannot be explained mechanistically through the same lens. We find that
neither feature sparsity nor feature importance cause discontinuous phase
changes, and that network sparsity (the ratio of active to total experts)
better characterizes MoEs. We develop new metrics for measuring superposition
across experts. Our findings demonstrate that models with greater network
sparsity exhibit greater \emph{monosemanticity}. We propose a new definition of
expert specialization based on monosemantic feature representation rather than
load balancing, showing that experts naturally organize around coherent feature
combinations when initialized appropriately. These results suggest that network
sparsity in MoEs may enable more interpretable models without sacrificing
performance, challenging the common assumption that interpretability and
capability are fundamentally at odds.

### [136] [DBLoss: Decomposition-based Loss Function for Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23672)
*Xiangfei Qiu,Xingjian Wu,Hanyin Cheng,Xvyuan Liu,Chenjuan Guo,Jilin Hu,Bin Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于分解的损失函数DBLoss，通过指数移动平均将时间序列分解为季节性和趋势分量，分别计算损失并加权，可显著提升深度学习预测模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的MSE损失函数有时无法准确捕捉预测范围内的季节性模式或趋势，即使在前向传播中使用分解模块分别建模趋势和季节性。

Method: 使用指数移动平均将时间序列分解为季节性和趋势分量，然后分别计算这两个分量的损失，最后进行加权组合。

Result: 大量实验表明，DBLoss显著提升了最先进模型在多样化真实世界数据集上的性能表现。

Conclusion: DBLoss为时间序列损失函数设计提供了新的视角，是一种简单而有效的通用损失函数，可与任何深度学习预测模型结合使用。

Abstract: Time series forecasting holds significant value in various domains such as
economics, traffic, energy, and AIOps, as accurate predictions facilitate
informed decision-making. However, the existing Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss
function sometimes fails to accurately capture the seasonality or trend within
the forecasting horizon, even when decomposition modules are used in the
forward propagation to model the trend and seasonality separately. To address
these challenges, we propose a simple yet effective Decomposition-Based Loss
function called DBLoss. This method uses exponential moving averages to
decompose the time series into seasonal and trend components within the
forecasting horizon, and then calculates the loss for each of these components
separately, followed by weighting them. As a general loss function, DBLoss can
be combined with any deep learning forecasting model. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that DBLoss significantly improves the performance of
state-of-the-art models across diverse real-world datasets and provides a new
perspective on the design of time series loss functions.

TL;DR: DEPS是一种端到端算法，从专家演示中发现参数化技能，通过联合学习参数化技能策略和元策略，在未见任务上实现更好的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决潜在变量模型中常见的退化问题，确保学习到的技能具有时间扩展性、语义意义和适应性，从而从多任务专家演示中学习参数化技能。

Method: 结合时间变分推理和信息论正则化方法，联合学习参数化技能策略和元策略，元策略在每个时间步选择适当的离散技能和连续参数。

Result: 在LIBERO和MetaWorld基准测试中优于多任务和技能学习基线方法，显著提高了对未见任务的泛化能力。

Conclusion: DEPS能够发现可解释的参数化技能，如物体抓取技能，其连续参数定义了抓取位置，证明了方法的有效性。

Abstract: We present DEPS, an end-to-end algorithm for discovering parameterized skills
from expert demonstrations. Our method learns parameterized skill policies
jointly with a meta-policy that selects the appropriate discrete skill and
continuous parameters at each timestep. Using a combination of temporal
variational inference and information-theoretic regularization methods, we
address the challenge of degeneracy common in latent variable models, ensuring
that the learned skills are temporally extended, semantically meaningful, and
adaptable. We empirically show that learning parameterized skills from
multitask expert demonstrations significantly improves generalization to unseen
tasks. Our method outperforms multitask as well as skill learning baselines on
both LIBERO and MetaWorld benchmarks. We also demonstrate that DEPS discovers
interpretable parameterized skills, such as an object grasping skill whose
continuous arguments define the grasp location.

TL;DR: 提出了HIPE方法，一种基于信息论的采集策略，用于贝叶斯优化的初始化阶段，平衡预测不确定性减少和超参数学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统（准）随机初始化方法忽略两个关键因素：(a)空间填充设计可能不利于减少预测不确定性，(b)高效的超参数学习与空间填充设计可能存在冲突。

Method: HIPE方法使用信息论原理，在高斯过程设置中推导出闭式表达式，平衡预测不确定性减少与超参数学习。

Result: 在主动学习和少样本贝叶斯优化实验中，HIPE在预测精度、超参数识别和后续优化性能方面优于标准初始化策略，特别是在大批量少样本设置中。

Conclusion: HIPE方法在贝叶斯优化初始化阶段显著提升了性能，特别适用于现实世界中常见的大批量少样本应用场景。

Abstract: Bayesian Optimization is a widely used method for optimizing expensive
black-box functions, relying on probabilistic surrogate models such as Gaussian
Processes. The quality of the surrogate model is crucial for good optimization
performance, especially in the few-shot setting where only a small number of
batches of points can be evaluated. In this setting, the initialization plays a
critical role in shaping the surrogate's predictive quality and guiding
subsequent optimization. Despite this, practitioners typically rely on
(quasi-)random designs to cover the input space. However, such approaches
neglect two key factors: (a) space-filling designs may not be desirable to
reduce predictive uncertainty, and (b) efficient hyperparameter learning during
initialization is essential for high-quality prediction, which may conflict
with space-filling designs. To address these limitations, we propose
Hyperparameter-Informed Predictive Exploration (HIPE), a novel acquisition
strategy that balances predictive uncertainty reduction with hyperparameter
learning using information-theoretic principles. We derive a closed-form
expression for HIPE in the Gaussian Process setting and demonstrate its
effectiveness through extensive experiments in active learning and few-shot BO.
Our results show that HIPE outperforms standard initialization strategies in
terms of predictive accuracy, hyperparameter identification, and subsequent
optimization performance, particularly in large-batch, few-shot settings
relevant to many real-world Bayesian Optimization applications.

*Gokturk Aytug Akarlar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Chimera是一个神经-符号-因果架构，集成了LLM策略师、形式验证符号约束引擎和因果推理模块，在电子商务环境中展现出比纯LLM或LLM+符号约束架构更优越的性能和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM代理在关键领域部署时的脆弱性问题，避免因提示框架不同而导致灾难性结果，确保自主决策代理在生产环境中的可靠性。

Method: 提出Chimera架构，整合三个互补组件：LLM策略师（负责策略生成）、形式验证符号约束引擎（确保约束合规）、因果推理模块（进行反事实推理）。在包含价格弹性、信任动态和季节性需求的电子商务环境中进行52周模拟测试。

Result: Chimera在组织偏向销量或利润优化的场景中均表现最佳：纯LLM代理出现灾难性失败（销量场景损失99K美元）或品牌信任破坏（利润场景信任下降48.6%）；添加符号约束可防止灾难但仅达到Chimera利润的43-87%；Chimera实现最高回报（152万和196万美元，部分案例达220万美元）并提升品牌信任（+1.8%和+10.8%，部分案例+20.86%）。

Conclusion: 架构设计而非提示工程决定了自主代理在生产环境中的可靠性。Chimera通过神经-符号-因果集成实现了提示无关的鲁棒性，形式验证证明所有场景中零约束违规。

Abstract: Large language models show promise as autonomous decision-making agents, yet
their deployment in high-stakes domains remains fraught with risk. Without
architectural safeguards, LLM agents exhibit catastrophic brittleness:
identical capabilities produce wildly different outcomes depending solely on
prompt framing. We present Chimera, a neuro-symbolic-causal architecture that
integrates three complementary components - an LLM strategist, a formally
verified symbolic constraint engine, and a causal inference module for
counterfactual reasoning. We benchmark Chimera against baseline architectures
(LLM-only, LLM with symbolic constraints) across 52-week simulations in a
realistic e-commerce environment featuring price elasticity, trust dynamics,
and seasonal demand. Under organizational biases toward either volume or margin
optimization, LLM-only agents fail catastrophically (total loss of \$99K in
volume scenarios) or destroy brand trust (-48.6% in margin scenarios). Adding
symbolic constraints prevents disasters but achieves only 43-87% of Chimera's
profit. Chimera consistently delivers the highest returns (\$1.52M and \$1.96M
respectively, some cases +\$2.2M) while improving brand trust (+1.8% and
+10.8%, some cases +20.86%), demonstrating prompt-agnostic robustness. Our TLA+
formal verification proves zero constraint violations across all scenarios.
These results establish that architectural design not prompt engineering
determines the reliability of autonomous agents in production environments. We
provide open-source implementations and interactive demonstrations for
reproducibility.

*Junwen Ma,Mingyu Ge,Yisen Wang,Yong Zhang,Weicheng Fu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合Transformer和BiLSTM的并行预测框架，用于混沌系统的时间序列预测，在Lorenz系统中验证了其在长期轨迹跟踪和状态补全方面的优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 混沌系统的非线性特性导致对初始条件极度敏感，传统方法难以同时捕捉时间序列的局部特征和全局依赖关系。

Method: 采用双分支架构：Transformer分支捕获长程依赖，BiLSTM分支提取局部时序特征，通过特征融合层整合互补表示。

Result: 在Lorenz系统的自主演化预测和未测量变量推断任务中，混合框架均优于单分支架构，表现出更强的鲁棒性和有效性。

Conclusion: Transformer与BiLSTM的并行混合框架能够有效提升混沌系统预测的准确性，为复杂动力学系统建模提供了有力工具。

Abstract: The nonlinear nature of chaotic systems results in extreme sensitivity to
initial conditions and highly intricate dynamical behaviors, posing fundamental
challenges for accurately predicting their evolution. To overcome the
limitation that conventional approaches fail to capture both local features and
global dependencies in chaotic time series simultaneously, this study proposes
a parallel predictive framework integrating Transformer and Bidirectional Long
Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) networks. The hybrid model employs a dual-branch
architecture, where the Transformer branch mainly captures long-range
dependencies while the BiLSTM branch focuses on extracting local temporal
features. The complementary representations from the two branches are fused in
a dedicated feature-fusion layer to enhance predictive accuracy. As
illustrating examples, the model's performance is systematically evaluated on
two representative tasks in the Lorenz system. The first is autonomous
evolution prediction, in which the model recursively extrapolates system
trajectories from the time-delay embeddings of the state vector to evaluate
long-term tracking accuracy and stability. The second is inference of
unmeasured variable, where the model reconstructs the unobserved states from
the time-delay embeddings of partial observations to assess its
state-completion capability. The results consistently indicate that the
proposed hybrid framework outperforms both single-branch architectures across
tasks, demonstrating its robustness and effectiveness in chaotic system
prediction.

Motivation: 现实世界控制系统通常是连续时间的，但现有强化学习算法主要针对离散时间动态设计，需要解决连续时间环境下的强化学习问题。

Method: 使用高斯过程和贝叶斯神经网络等概率模型学习非线性ODE系统动态的不确定性感知模型，提出COMBRL算法贪婪最大化奖励和模型认知不确定性的加权和。

Result: COMBRL在奖励驱动设置下实现次线性遗憾，在无监督RL设置下提供样本复杂度界限，实验表明其比现有方法更具可扩展性和样本效率，在多个深度RL任务中优于基线方法。

Conclusion: COMBRL为连续时间模型强化学习提供了一种可扩展且样本高效的方法，在标准和无监督RL设置下均表现出色。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning algorithms are typically designed for discrete-time
dynamics, even though the underlying real-world control systems are often
continuous in time. In this paper, we study the problem of continuous-time
reinforcement learning, where the unknown system dynamics are represented using
nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs). We leverage probabilistic
models, such as Gaussian processes and Bayesian neural networks, to learn an
uncertainty-aware model of the underlying ODE. Our algorithm, COMBRL, greedily
maximizes a weighted sum of the extrinsic reward and model epistemic
uncertainty. This yields a scalable and sample-efficient approach to
continuous-time model-based RL. We show that COMBRL achieves sublinear regret
in the reward-driven setting, and in the unsupervised RL setting (i.e., without
extrinsic rewards), we provide a sample complexity bound. In our experiments,
we evaluate COMBRL in both standard and unsupervised RL settings and
demonstrate that it scales better, is more sample-efficient than prior methods,
and outperforms baselines across several deep RL tasks.

Abstract: This PhD thesis investigates the societal impact of machine learning (ML). ML
increasingly informs consequential decisions and recommendations, significantly
affecting many aspects of our lives. As these data-driven systems are often
developed without explicit fairness considerations, they carry the risk of
discriminatory effects. The contributions in this thesis enable more
appropriate measurement of fairness in ML systems, systematic decomposition of
ML systems to anticipate bias dynamics, and effective interventions that reduce
algorithmic discrimination while maintaining system utility. I conclude by
discussing ongoing challenges and future research directions as ML systems,
including generative artificial intelligence, become increasingly integrated
into society. This work offers a foundation for ensuring that ML's societal
impact aligns with broader social values.

Result: 通过MUStReason对VideoLMs进行定量和定性评估，分析了讽刺分类性能和生成推理的质量。

Conclusion: 该研究为改进视频语言模型在讽刺检测等复杂推理任务上的表现提供了诊断工具和方法框架。

Abstract: Sarcasm is a specific type of irony which involves discerning what is said
from what is meant. Detecting sarcasm depends not only on the literal content
of an utterance but also on non-verbal cues such as speaker's tonality, facial
expressions and conversational context. However, current multimodal models
struggle with complex tasks like sarcasm detection, which require identifying
relevant cues across modalities and pragmatically reasoning over them to infer
the speaker's intention. To explore these limitations in VideoLMs, we introduce
MUStReason, a diagnostic benchmark enriched with annotations of
modality-specific relevant cues and underlying reasoning steps to identify
sarcastic intent. In addition to benchmarking sarcasm classification
performance in VideoLMs, using MUStReason we quantitatively and qualitatively
evaluate the generated reasoning by disentangling the problem into perception
and reasoning, we propose PragCoT, a framework that steers VideoLMs to focus on
implied intentions over literal meaning, a property core to detecting sarcasm.

Motivation: 现有对齐技术（如RLHF）中的奖励模型经常利用虚假相关性（如响应长度、歧视、谄媚等），这已成为日益关注的问题。

Method: 首先建立数据生成过程的数学表述，假设观测数据来自虚假和非虚假潜在变量。使用变分推断恢复这些变量，并利用它们训练奖励模型。

Conclusion: 提出的框架能够减轻奖励模型中的偏见，同时保留反映真实偏好的潜在因素，为构建更可靠的奖励模型提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Recent alignment techniques, such as reinforcement learning from human
feedback, have been widely adopted to align large language models with human
preferences by learning and leveraging reward models. In practice, these models
often exploit spurious correlations, involving, e.g., response length,
discrimination, sycophancy, and conceptual bias, which is a problem that has
received increasing attention. In this work, we propose a principled framework
that mitigates these biases in reward models while preserving the underlying
factors that reflect intended preferences. We first provide a formulation of
the data-generating process, assuming that the observed data (e.g., text) is
generated from both spurious and non-spurious latent variables. We show that,
interestingly, these non-spurious latent variables can be theoretically
identified from data, regardless of whether a surrogate for the spurious latent
variables is available. This further inspires a practical method that uses
variational inference to recover these variables and leverages them to train
reward models. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate
that our method effectively mitigates spurious correlation issues and yields
more robust reward models.

Motivation: 探索Cobweb/4V模型在持续学习中抵抗灾难性遗忘的机制，理解其鲁棒性的来源。

Method: 通过比较Cobweb/4V与神经基线模型（包括新提出的CobwebNN），在MNIST、Fashion-MNIST、MedMNIST和CIFAR-10等数据集上进行实验。

Result: 实验表明自适应结构重组增强学习可塑性，稀疏更新减少干扰，信息理论学习无需重访过去数据即可保留先验知识。

Conclusion: 这些发现揭示了缓解灾难性遗忘的机制，突显了基于概念和信息理论方法在构建稳定自适应持续学习系统中的潜力。

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting remains a central challenge in continual learning,
where models are required to integrate new knowledge over time without losing
what they have previously learned. In prior work, we introduced Cobweb/4V, a
hierarchical concept formation model that exhibited robustness to catastrophic
forgetting in visual domains. Motivated by this robustness, we examine three
hypotheses regarding the factors that contribute to such stability: (1)
adaptive structural reorganization enhances knowledge retention, (2) sparse and
selective updates reduce interference, and (3) information-theoretic learning
based on sufficiency statistics provides advantages over gradient-based
backpropagation. To test these hypotheses, we compare Cobweb/4V with neural
baselines, including CobwebNN, a neural implementation of the Cobweb framework
introduced in this work. Experiments on datasets of varying complexity (MNIST,
Fashion-MNIST, MedMNIST, and CIFAR-10) show that adaptive restructuring
enhances learning plasticity, sparse updates help mitigate interference, and
the information-theoretic learning process preserves prior knowledge without
revisiting past data. Together, these findings provide insight into mechanisms
that can mitigate catastrophic forgetting and highlight the potential of
concept-based, information-theoretic approaches for building stable and
adaptive continual learning systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有蛋白质设计方法如RSO依赖单路径梯度下降，忽略了序列空间约束，限制了设计的多样性和可行性

Method: 使用马尔可夫链蒙特卡洛(MCMC)框架，在连续logit空间中结合梯度引导探索和蛋白质语言模型引导的跳跃，能量函数整合AlphaFold2结构目标和ESM2序列先验

Result: 在蛋白质结合物设计任务中，RSS比RSO基线产生5倍多的可设计结构和2-3倍的结构多样性，计算成本相同

Conclusion: RSS为高效探索蛋白质设计空间提供了一个原理性方法

Abstract: Protein design using structure prediction models such as AlphaFold2 has shown
remarkable success, but existing approaches like relaxed sequence optimization
(RSO) rely on single-path gradient descent and ignore sequence-space
constraints, limiting diversity and designability. We introduce Relaxed
Sequence Sampling (RSS), a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) framework that
integrates structural and evolutionary information for protein design. RSS
operates in continuous logit space, combining gradient-guided exploration with
protein language model-informed jumps. Its energy function couples
AlphaFold2-derived structural objectives with ESM2-derived sequence priors,
balancing accuracy and biological plausibility. In an in silico protein binder
design task, RSS produces 5$\times$ more designable structures and 2-3$\times$
greater structural diversity than RSO baselines, at equal computational cost.
These results highlight RSS as a principled approach for efficiently exploring
the protein design landscape.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统台风集合预报系统计算成本高且难以充分表征大气非线性特征，需要开发更有效的AI预报方法。

Method: FuXi-ENS采用可学习扰动方案生成集合预报，并与ECMWF-ENS在2018年全球90个台风上进行系统性比较。

Result: FuXi-ENS在台风相关物理变量预测和路径预报方面优势明显，集合离散度更小，但强度预报仍低估观测值。动力学分析显示其能更好捕捉大尺度环流。

Conclusion: 可学习扰动方案有潜力提升台风预报技能，为基于AI的极端天气集合预报提供了宝贵见解。

Abstract: Tropical cyclones (TCs) are highly destructive and inherently uncertain
weather systems. Ensemble forecasting helps quantify these uncertainties, yet
traditional systems are constrained by high computational costs and limited
capability to fully represent atmospheric nonlinearity. FuXi-ENS introduces a
learnable perturbation scheme for ensemble generation, representing a novel
AI-based forecasting paradigm. Here, we systematically compare FuXi-ENS with
ECMWF-ENS using all 90 global TCs in 2018, examining their performance in
TC-related physical variables, track and intensity forecasts, and the
associated dynamical and thermodynamical fields. FuXi-ENS demonstrates clear
advantages in predicting TC-related physical variables, and achieves more
accurate track forecasts with reduced ensemble spread, though it still
underestimates intensity relative to observations. Further dynamical and
thermodynamical analyses reveal that FuXi-ENS better captures large-scale
circulation, with moisture turbulent energy more tightly concentrated around
the TC warm core, whereas ECMWF-ENS exhibits a more dispersed distribution.
These findings highlight the potential of learnable perturbations to improve TC
forecasting skill and provide valuable insights for advancing AI-based ensemble
prediction of extreme weather events that have significant societal impacts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏自编码器在语言模型中成功提取可解释特征，但在音频生成中面临挑战：音频的密集性使得压缩后语义模糊，且自动特征表征有限。

Method: 在音频自编码器潜在空间上训练稀疏自编码器，然后学习从SAE特征到离散化声学属性的线性映射。在连续和离散音频潜在空间上验证方法。

Conclusion: 该框架不仅适用于音频模态，还可扩展到视觉潜在空间生成模型的可解释分析。

Abstract: While sparse autoencoders (SAEs) successfully extract interpretable features
from language models, applying them to audio generation faces unique
challenges: audio's dense nature requires compression that obscures semantic
meaning, and automatic feature characterization remains limited. We propose a
framework for interpreting audio generative models by mapping their latent
representations to human-interpretable acoustic concepts. We train SAEs on
audio autoencoder latents, then learn linear mappings from SAE features to
discretized acoustic properties (pitch, amplitude, and timbre). This enables
both controllable manipulation and analysis of the AI music generation process,
revealing how acoustic properties emerge during synthesis. We validate our
approach on continuous (DiffRhythm-VAE) and discrete (EnCodec, WavTokenizer)
audio latent spaces, and analyze DiffRhythm, a state-of-the-art text-to-music
model, to demonstrate how pitch, timbre, and loudness evolve throughout
generation. While our work is only done on audio modality, our framework can be
extended to interpretable analysis of visual latent space generation models.

*Adela DePavia,Vasileios Charisopoulos,Rebecca Willett*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Adam等自适应梯度方法对数据旋转敏感，可能丧失其偏向复杂决策边界的优势。通过正交重参数化方法可以恢复Adam的丰富性偏置。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解自适应梯度方法（如Adam）相对于梯度下降在模型泛化能力上的影响，特别是Adam对数据旋转的敏感性如何影响其学习复杂决策边界的能力。

Method: 分析Adam对正交变换的敏感性，并采用正交重参数化方法使一阶优化方法对数据旋转具有等变性。

Result: 即使小的数据旋转也会使Adam丧失其丰富性偏置，收敛到远离贝叶斯最优决策边界的线性边界。正交重参数化能够恢复Adam的丰富性偏置。

Conclusion: Adam对数据旋转的敏感性会削弱其优势，但通过正交重参数化可以解决这一问题，使Adam保持对复杂决策边界的偏好。

Abstract: Adaptive gradient methods such as Adam and Adagrad are widely used in machine
learning, yet their effect on the generalization of learned models -- relative
to methods like gradient descent -- remains poorly understood. Prior work on
binary classification suggests that Adam exhibits a ``richness bias,'' which
can help it learn nonlinear decision boundaries closer to the Bayes-optimal
decision boundary relative to gradient descent. However, the coordinate-wise
preconditioning scheme employed by Adam renders the overall method sensitive to
orthogonal transformations of feature space. We show that this sensitivity can
manifest as a reversal of Adam's competitive advantage: even small rotations of
the underlying data distribution can make Adam forfeit its richness bias and
converge to a linear decision boundary that is farther from the Bayes-optimal
decision boundary than the one learned by gradient descent. To alleviate this
issue, we show that a recently proposed reparameterization method -- which
applies an orthogonal transformation to the optimization objective -- endows
any first-order method with equivariance to data rotations, and we empirically
demonstrate its ability to restore Adam's bias towards rich decision
boundaries.

TL;DR: 提出了一种物理信息驱动的算子学习方法，将RINO框架扩展到完全无需数据的设置，解决了训练数据稀缺和分辨率不均匀的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在工程应用中，获取高质量的训练数据（输入-输出函数对）具有挑战性，且数据集可能在不同实现中具有不均匀的离散化，网格分辨率在样本间变化。

Method: 将任意离散化的输入函数投影到潜在嵌入空间，使用预训练的基函数。通过多层感知机近似PDE算子，输入潜在编码和时空坐标，在物理空间中通过有限差分求解器强制PDE约束。

Result: 在多分辨率数据的数值示例上验证了方法的性能，输入函数在不同分辨率下采样，包括粗和细离散化。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效处理多分辨率数据，在无需大量高保真数据的情况下实现算子学习。

Abstract: The predictive accuracy of operator learning frameworks depends on the
quality and quantity of available training data (input-output function pairs),
often requiring substantial amounts of high-fidelity data, which can be
challenging to obtain in some real-world engineering applications. These
datasets may be unevenly discretized from one realization to another, with the
grid resolution varying across samples. In this study, we introduce a
physics-informed operator learning approach by extending the Resolution
Independent Neural Operator (RINO) framework to a fully data-free setup,
addressing both challenges simultaneously. Here, the arbitrarily (but
sufficiently finely) discretized input functions are projected onto a latent
embedding space (i.e., a vector space of finite dimensions), using pre-trained
basis functions. The operator associated with the underlying partial
differential equations (PDEs) is then approximated by a simple multi-layer
perceptron (MLP), which takes as input a latent code along with spatiotemporal
coordinates to produce the solution in the physical space. The PDEs are
enforced via a finite difference solver in the physical space. The validation
and performance of the proposed method are benchmarked on several numerical
examples with multi-resolution data, where input functions are sampled at
varying resolutions, including both coarse and fine discretizations.

TL;DR: 该研究开发了一个结合SHAP特征重要性和因果分析的创新故障检测框架，用于处理复杂工业过程数据，显著提高了检测准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业过程产生的复杂数据给故障检测系统带来挑战，现有机器学习方法往往结果不透明或性能不佳。研究旨在解决这些困难，为操作人员提供清晰可操作的故障洞察。

Method: 使用田纳西伊士曼过程作为基准，先采用标准模型发现局限性，然后转向更易处理的方法：使用SHAP识别关键过程特征，再通过有向无环图进行因果分析来揭示故障传播机制。

Result: 因果结构与SHAP发现高度一致，一致识别出冷却和分离系统等关键过程要素是故障发展的关键。该方法不仅提高了检测准确性，还提供了清晰的故障起源洞察。

Conclusion: 这种双重方法将预测能力与因果理解相结合，为复杂制造环境监控提供了强大工具，为更智能、更可解释的工业系统故障检测铺平了道路。

Abstract: Industrial processes generate complex data that challenge fault detection
systems, often yielding opaque or underwhelming results despite advanced
machine learning techniques. This study tackles such difficulties using the
Tennessee Eastman Process, a well-established benchmark known for its intricate
dynamics, to develop an innovative fault detection framework. Initial attempts
with standard models revealed limitations in both performance and
interpretability, prompting a shift toward a more tractable approach. By
employing SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), we transform the problem into a
more manageable and transparent form, pinpointing the most critical process
features driving fault predictions. This reduction in complexity unlocks the
ability to apply causal analysis through Directed Acyclic Graphs, generated by
multiple algorithms, to uncover the underlying mechanisms of fault propagation.
The resulting causal structures align strikingly with SHAP findings,
consistently highlighting key process elements-like cooling and separation
systems-as pivotal to fault development. Together, these methods not only
enhance detection accuracy but also provide operators with clear, actionable
insights into fault origins, a synergy that, to our knowledge, has not been
previously explored in this context. This dual approach bridges predictive
power with causal understanding, offering a robust tool for monitoring complex
manufacturing environments and paving the way for smarter, more interpretable
fault detection in industrial systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种通过累积连续低秩增量来构建高秩权重更新的方法，有效解决了LoRA在收敛速度和效果上的限制，无需重新开始优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型规模扩大，计算开销成为任务特定微调的主要瓶颈。虽然LoRA通过限制权重更新到低维子空间有效降低了成本，但这种限制会阻碍效果并减缓收敛速度。

Method: 通过累积连续低秩增量逐步构建高秩权重更新。识别每个更新的最优低秩矩阵以最小化损失函数并紧密逼近全参数微调。通过适当缩放原始低秩矩阵的列来形成最优选择，实现高效无缝优化。

Result: 在规模达120亿参数的流行LLM上进行广泛数值测试，在自然语言理解、常识推理和数学问题解决等多样化任务上，相对于最先进的LoRA变体展现出持续的性能提升和快速收敛。

Conclusion: 该方法通过分析找到最优缩放，提供了严格的性能保证，有效解决了LoRA的限制，实现了更好的性能和更快的收敛速度。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to scale in size, the computational
overhead has become a major bottleneck for task-specific fine-tuning. While
low-rank adaptation (LoRA) effectively curtails this cost by confining the
weight updates to a low-dimensional subspace, such a restriction can hinder
effectiveness and slow convergence. This contribution deals with these
limitations by accumulating progressively a high-rank weight update from
consecutive low-rank increments. Specifically, the per update optimal low-rank
matrix is identified to minimize the loss function and closely approximate full
fine-tuning. To endow efficient and seamless optimization without restarting,
this optimal choice is formed by appropriately scaling the columns of the
original low-rank matrix. Rigorous performance guarantees reveal that the
optimal scaling can be found analytically. Extensive numerical tests with
popular LLMs scaling up to 12 billion parameters demonstrate a consistent
performance gain and fast convergence relative to state-of-the-art LoRA
variants on diverse tasks including natural language understanding, commonsense
reasoning, and mathematical problem solving.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统扩散训练虽然已经产生较低的PDE残差，但需要进一步通过物理约束来正则化模型，增强生成场的物理合理性。

Method: 基于现有扩散架构，采用残差公式，在潜在表示解码到全分辨率空间后计算PDE损失，通过有限差分近似有效平流-扩散平衡来强制物理一致性。

Result: 经验观察表明，传统扩散训练已产生低PDE残差，而使用额外损失进行微调能进一步正则化模型并增强生成场的物理合理性。

Conclusion: 物理条件化的潜在扩散模型能有效用于大气数据动态降尺度，代码已在GitHub开源供未来参考和开发。

Abstract: This work presents a physics-conditioned latent diffusion model tailored for
dynamical downscaling of atmospheric data, with a focus on reconstructing
high-resolution 2-m temperature fields. Building upon a pre-existing diffusion
architecture and employing a residual formulation against a reference UNet, we
integrate a partial differential equation (PDE) loss term into the model's
training objective. The PDE loss is computed in the full resolution (pixel)
space by decoding the latent representation and is designed to enforce physical
consistency through a finite-difference approximation of an effective
advection-diffusion balance. Empirical observations indicate that conventional
diffusion training already yields low PDE residuals, and we investigate how
fine-tuning with this additional loss further regularizes the model and
enhances the physical plausibility of the generated fields. The entirety of our
codebase is available on Github, for future reference and development.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GIFT是一种新的强化学习框架，通过最小化隐式和显式奖励模型之间的差异来对齐LLMs，将复杂的奖励最大化目标转化为简单的MSE损失，相比现有方法具有更好的收敛性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如PPO、GRPO直接最大化累积奖励，而DPO、UNA等离线方法缺乏探索能力。GIFT旨在结合在线生成和隐式奖励的优势，解决奖励模型对齐的复杂性问题。

Method: 结合GRPO的在线多响应生成和归一化、DPO的隐式奖励公式、UNA的隐式-显式奖励对齐原则，通过联合归一化将问题转化为凸优化问题。

Result: GIFT在数学基准测试中实现了优越的推理和对齐性能，计算效率高，收敛更快，泛化能力更强，训练过拟合显著减少。

Conclusion: GIFT通过隐式-显式奖励对齐的简单MSE损失公式，有效解决了LLM对齐问题，在保持在线探索能力的同时实现了更好的性能和效率。

Abstract: I propose \textbf{G}roup-relative \textbf{I}mplicit \textbf{F}ine
\textbf{T}uning (GIFT), a novel reinforcement learning framework for aligning
LLMs. Instead of directly maximizing cumulative rewards like PPO or GRPO, GIFT
minimizes the discrepancy between implicit and explicit reward models. It
combines three key ideas: (1) the online multi-response generation and
normalization of GRPO, (2) the implicit reward formulation of DPO, and (3) the
implicit-explicit reward alignment principle of UNA. By jointly normalizing the
implicit and explicit rewards, GIFT eliminates an otherwise intractable term
that prevents effective use of implicit rewards. This normalization transforms
the complex reward maximization objective into a simple mean squared error
(MSE) loss between the normalized reward functions, converting a non-convex
optimization problem into a convex, stable, and analytically differentiable
formulation. Unlike offline methods such as DPO and UNA, GIFT remains on-policy
and thus retains exploration capability. Compared to GRPO, it requires fewer
hyperparameters, converges faster, and generalizes better with significantly
reduced training overfitting. Empirically, GIFT achieves superior reasoning and
alignment performance on mathematical benchmarks while remaining
computationally efficient.

Conclusion: 基于图的特征选择与机器学习相结合的方法能够有效解决电动公交车预测性维护的挑战，为主动维护提供可靠支持。

Abstract: Predictive maintenance (PdM) is crucial for optimizing efficiency and
minimizing downtime of electric buses. While these vehicles provide
environmental benefits, they pose challenges for PdM due to complex electric
transmission and battery systems. Traditional maintenance, often based on
scheduled inspections, struggles to capture anomalies in multi-dimensional
real-time CAN Bus data. This study employs a graph-based feature selection
method to analyze relationships among CAN Bus parameters of electric buses and
investigates the prediction performance of targeted alarms using artificial
intelligence techniques. The raw data collected over two years underwent
extensive preprocessing to ensure data quality and consistency. A hybrid
graph-based feature selection tool was developed by combining statistical
filtering (Pearson correlation, Cramer's V, ANOVA F-test) with
optimization-based community detection algorithms (InfoMap, Leiden, Louvain,
Fast Greedy). Machine learning models, including SVM, Random Forest, and
XGBoost, were optimized through grid and random search with data balancing via
SMOTEEN and binary search-based down-sampling. Model interpretability was
achieved using LIME to identify the features influencing predictions. The
results demonstrate that the developed system effectively predicts vehicle
alarms, enhances feature interpretability, and supports proactive maintenance
strategies aligned with Industry 4.0 principles.

Motivation: 现有MIP方法在回归任务中要么仅限于二元特征，要么在连续大规模数据下计算不可行。简单二值化连续特征会牺牲全局最优性并产生不必要的深树。

Method: 将最优回归树训练重构为两阶段优化问题，提出RS-ORT算法，专门在树结构变量上进行分支定界，结合边界收紧技术（闭式叶预测、经验阈值离散化、精确深度1子树解析）和可分解上下界策略。

Conclusion: RS-ORT通过专门的分支定界算法和边界收紧技术，有效解决了连续特征下最优回归树训练的计算难题，在大规模数据集上实现了高效且性能优越的树学习。

Abstract: Mixed-integer programming (MIP) has emerged as a powerful framework for
learning optimal decision trees. Yet, existing MIP approaches for regression
tasks are either limited to purely binary features or become computationally
intractable when continuous, large-scale data are involved. Naively binarizing
continuous features sacrifices global optimality and often yields needlessly
deep trees. We recast the optimal regression-tree training as a two-stage
optimization problem and propose Reduced-Space Optimal Regression Trees
(RS-ORT) - a specialized branch-and-bound (BB) algorithm that branches
exclusively on tree-structural variables. This design guarantees the
algorithm's convergence and its independence from the number of training
samples. Leveraging the model's structure, we introduce several bound
tightening techniques - closed-form leaf prediction, empirical threshold
discretization, and exact depth-1 subtree parsing - that combine with
decomposable upper and lower bounding strategies to accelerate the training.
The BB node-wise decomposition enables trivial parallel execution, further
alleviating the computational intractability even for million-size datasets.
Based on the empirical studies on several regression benchmarks containing both
binary and continuous features, RS-ORT also delivers superior training and
testing performance than state-of-the-art methods. Notably, on datasets with up
to 2,000,000 samples with continuous features, RS-ORT can obtain guaranteed
training performance with a simpler tree structure and a better generalization
ability in four hours.

Motivation: 现有因果发现方法主要关注成对因果关系，忽略了变量组（子系统）之间的相互作用和集体因果影响，特别是在非线性多元时间序列中。

Method: 使用深度学习联合建模所有时间序列组的结构关系，对训练好的模型应用组级干预，然后进行模型不变性测试来确定变量组之间的因果链接。

Abstract: Causal discovery uncovers complex relationships between variables, enhancing
predictions, decision-making, and insights into real-world systems, especially
in nonlinear multivariate time series. However, most existing methods primarily
focus on pairwise cause-effect relationships, overlooking interactions among
groups of variables, i.e., subsystems and their collective causal influence. In
this study, we introduce gCDMI, a novel multi-group causal discovery method
that leverages group-level interventions on trained deep neural networks and
employs model invariance testing to infer causal relationships. Our approach
involves three key steps. First, we use deep learning to jointly model the
structural relationships among groups of all time series. Second, we apply
group-wise interventions to the trained model. Finally, we conduct model
invariance testing to determine the presence of causal links among variable
groups. We evaluate our method on simulated datasets, demonstrating its
superior performance in identifying group-level causal relationships compared
to existing methods. Additionally, we validate our approach on real-world
datasets, including brain networks and climate ecosystems. Our results
highlight that applying group-level interventions to deep learning models,
combined with invariance testing, can effectively reveal complex causal
structures, offering valuable insights for domains such as neuroscience and
climate science.

Motivation: 探索当前LLM中注意力机制的Query-Key-Value权重三元组是否可以简化，验证Query权重的冗余性。

Method: 在简化假设下进行理论分析，证明Query权重的冗余性，并在完整复杂度的GPT-3小架构上进行实验验证，比较减少Query权重后的模型与标准基线的验证损失。

Result: 减少Query权重的模型在验证损失上达到与标准基线相当的性能，同时将非嵌入/LM头参数减少了8%以上。

Conclusion: Query权重在注意力机制中是冗余的，这一发现在大规模模型中的潜在应用值得进一步研究。

Abstract: The Query, Key, Value weight triplet is a building block of current attention
mechanisms in state-of-the-art LLMs. We theoretically investigate whether this
triplet can be reduced, proving under simplifying assumptions that the Query
weights are redundant, thereby reducing the number of non-embedding/lm-head
parameters by over 8%. We validate the theory on full-complexity GPT-3 small
architectures (with layer normalization, skip connections, and weight decay)
trained from scratch, demonstrating that the reduced model achieves comparable
validation loss to standard baselines. These findings motivate the
investigation of the Query weight redundancy at scale.

Result: 成功将折扣奖励情况下的主要结果扩展到平均奖励情况：在唯一且遍历的最优策略下，值迭代算法实现几何收敛。

Conclusion: 通过几何解释的统一框架，证明了平均奖励MDP中值迭代的几何收敛性，为MDP理论分析提供了更统一的视角。

Abstract: The theoretical analysis of Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) is commonly
split into two cases - the average-reward case and the discounted-reward case -
which, while sharing similarities, are typically analyzed separately. In this
work, we extend a recently introduced geometric interpretation of MDPs for the
discounted-reward case to the average-reward case, thereby unifying both. This
allows us to extend a major result known for the discounted-reward case to the
average-reward case: under a unique and ergodic optimal policy, the Value
Iteration algorithm achieves a geometric convergence rate.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: STE提供高质量但有偏的梯度，ZO梯度无偏但计算昂贵，需要一种能减少STE偏差同时降低计算成本的方法

Method: FOGZO（一阶引导的零阶梯度下降），通过结合STE和ZO方法的优势来减少偏差并降低计算量

Result: 相比STE，在相同迭代次数下：DeiT Tiny/Small准确率提升1-8%，ResNet 18/50提升1-2%，LLaMA模型困惑度改善1-22点；相比n-SPSA，在相同损失下计算量减少796倍

Conclusion: FOGZO在量化神经网络训练中有效平衡了质量与效率，显著优于单独的STE或ZO方法

Abstract: We study the problem of training neural networks with quantized parameters.
Learning low-precision quantized parameters by enabling computation of
gradients via the Straight-Through Estimator (STE) can be challenging. While
the STE enables back-propagation, which is a first-order method, recent works
have explored the use of zeroth-order (ZO) gradient descent for fine-tuning. We
note that the STE provides high-quality biased gradients, and ZO gradients are
unbiased but can be expensive. We thus propose First-Order-Guided Zeroth-Order
Gradient Descent (FOGZO) that reduces STE bias while reducing computations
relative to ZO methods. Empirically, we show FOGZO improves the tradeoff
between quality and training time in Quantization-Aware Pre-Training.
Specifically, versus STE at the same number of iterations, we show a 1-8\%
accuracy improvement for DeiT Tiny/Small, 1-2\% accuracy improvement on ResNet
18/50, and 1-22 perplexity point improvement for LLaMA models with up to 0.3
billion parameters. For the same loss, FOGZO yields a 796$\times$ reduction in
computation versus n-SPSA for a 2-layer MLP on MNIST. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习虽然能保护敏感数据，但仍易受梯度泄漏攻击威胁，需要评估差分隐私机制的实际防御效果。

Method: 在模拟联邦学习环境中，使用不同隐私级别训练计算机视觉模型，分析从截获梯度中重构私有数据的质量。

Result: DP-SGD能显著缓解梯度泄漏攻击风险，但会适度影响模型效用；PDP-SGD保持强分类性能但无法有效防御重构攻击。

Conclusion: 需要在分布式学习场景中超越理论保证来实证评估隐私机制，因为信息泄露可能对数据安全和隐私构成严重威胁。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) allows for the training of Machine Learning models in
a collaborative manner without the need to share sensitive data. However, it
remains vulnerable to Gradient Leakage Attacks (GLAs), which can reveal private
information from the shared model updates. In this work, we investigate the
effectiveness of Differential Privacy (DP) mechanisms - specifically, DP-SGD
and a variant based on explicit regularization (PDP-SGD) - as defenses against
GLAs. To this end, we evaluate the performance of several computer vision
models trained under varying privacy levels on a simple classification task,
and then analyze the quality of private data reconstructions obtained from the
intercepted gradients in a simulated FL environment. Our results demonstrate
that DP-SGD significantly mitigates the risk of gradient leakage attacks,
albeit with a moderate trade-off in model utility. In contrast, PDP-SGD
maintains strong classification performance but proves ineffective as a
practical defense against reconstruction attacks. These findings highlight the
importance of empirically evaluating privacy mechanisms beyond their
theoretical guarantees, particularly in distributed learning scenarios where
information leakage may represent an unassumable critical threat to data
security and privacy.

Motivation: 高维流动模型的集合模拟计算成本过高，而现有神经算子需要大量数据且难以推广到3D流动。需要开发无需数据、计算高效的替代方法。

Method: 采用基于物理的架构，直接输入初始条件、边界条件和强迫函数，无需配对解数据。结合数值方法和机器学习可扩展性。

Result: 在2D基准测试和3D测试案例中，该方法在精度上超越现有神经算子，对于集合模拟比传统数值求解器更高效。首次实现了3D Navier-Stokes方程的数据自由神经算子求解。

Conclusion: 该方法为端到端科学模拟和预测建立了实用的数据自由、高保真PDE替代模型路径，结合了数值基础架构和机器学习可扩展性。

Abstract: Ensemble simulations of high-dimensional flow models (e.g., Navier Stokes
type PDEs) are computationally prohibitive for real time applications. Neural
operators enable fast inference but are limited by costly data requirements and
poor generalization to 3D flows. We present a data-free operator network for
the Navier Stokes equations that eliminates the need for paired solution data
and enables robust, real time inference for large ensemble forecasting. The
physics-grounded architecture takes initial and boundary conditions as well as
forcing functions, yielding solutions robust to high variability and
perturbations. Across 2D benchmarks and 3D test cases, the method surpasses
prior neural operators in accuracy and, for ensembles, achieves greater
efficiency than conventional numerical solvers. Notably, it delivers accurate
solutions of the three dimensional Navier Stokes equations, a regime not
previously demonstrated for data free neural operators. By uniting a
numerically grounded architecture with the scalability of machine learning,
this approach establishes a practical pathway toward data free, high fidelity
PDE surrogates for end to end scientific simulation and prediction.

Motivation: 捕捉生物系统（特别是电生理过程）的时空行为，探索数据驱动模型在模拟生物动力学中的可行性。

Method: 构建三维多组分反应-扩散模型，结合可激发系统动力学与扩散过程，使用数值方法求解生成时间序列数据，并用Echo State Network进行训练和评估。

Result: Echo State Network成功重现了系统的动态行为，证明了数据驱动模型在模拟生物动力学中的有效性。

Conclusion: 使用数据驱动的多功能ESN模型模拟生物动力学是可行且有效的。

Abstract: In this work, a three-dimensional multicomponent reaction-diffusion model has
been developed, combining excitable-system dynamics with diffusion processes
and sharing conceptual features with the FitzHugh-Nagumo model. Designed to
capture the spatiotemporal behavior of biological systems, particularly
electrophysiological processes, the model was solved numerically to generate
time-series data. These data were subsequently used to train and evaluate an
Echo State Network (ESN), which successfully reproduced the system's dynamic
behavior. The results demonstrate that simulating biological dynamics using
data-driven, multifunctional ESN models is both feasible and effective.

### [164] [ChessQA: Evaluating Large Language Models for Chess Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23948)
*Qianfeng Wen,Zhenwei Tang,Ashton Anderson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ChessQA是一个全面的基准测试，用于评估大型语言模型在象棋理解方面的能力，涵盖五个任务类别：结构、模式、短战术、位置判断和语义，对应玩家掌握象棋知识的递进抽象层次。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LLM象棋能力评估方法零散且范围狭窄，难以准确衡量LLM对象棋的理解程度及其随规模、训练后方法或架构选择的变化。象棋作为理想测试平台，具有明确结构和客观真相，同时涵盖广泛技能水平。

Method: 创建ChessQA基准测试，包含五个任务类别：Structural（结构）、Motifs（模式）、Short Tactics（短战术）、Position Judgment（位置判断）和Semantic（语义），这些类别对应玩家积累象棋知识时掌握的递进抽象层次。

Result: 评估当代一系列LLM后，发现在所有五个类别中都存在持续弱点，并提供了按类别的结果和错误分析。

Conclusion: ChessQA提供了更全面的象棋能力和理解评估，显著超越了之前简单的走子质量评估，为诊断和比较提供了受控、一致的设置。该基准测试具有内在动态性，随着模型改进可以演进提示、答案键和构建脚本。

Abstract: Chess provides an ideal testbed for evaluating the reasoning, modeling, and
abstraction capabilities of large language models (LLMs), as it has
well-defined structure and objective ground truth while admitting a wide
spectrum of skill levels. However, existing evaluations of LLM ability in chess
are ad hoc and narrow in scope, making it difficult to accurately measure LLM
chess understanding and how it varies with scale, post-training methodologies,
or architecture choices. We present ChessQA, a comprehensive benchmark that
assesses LLM chess understanding across five task categories (Structural,
Motifs, Short Tactics, Position Judgment, and Semantic), which approximately
correspond to the ascending abstractions that players master as they accumulate
chess knowledge, from understanding basic rules and learning tactical motifs to
correctly calculating tactics, evaluating positions, and semantically
describing high-level concepts. In this way, ChessQA captures a more
comprehensive picture of chess ability and understanding, going significantly
beyond the simple move quality evaluations done previously, and offers a
controlled, consistent setting for diagnosis and comparison. Furthermore,
ChessQA is inherently dynamic, with prompts, answer keys, and construction
scripts that can evolve as models improve. Evaluating a range of contemporary
LLMs, we find persistent weaknesses across all five categories and provide
results and error analyses by category. We will release the code, periodically
refreshed datasets, and a public leaderboard to support further research.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了衡量思维链监控性的两个指标：清晰度（人类能否理解推理过程）和覆盖率（思维链是否包含人类得出最终输出所需的所有推理），并通过自动评分器实现这些指标的测量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着训练实践和模型架构的变化，思维链监控这一AI安全机会可能丧失，需要开发方法来保持监控性。

Method: 使用自动评分器提示词，让任何有能力的LLM计算现有思维链的清晰度和覆盖率，并在合成思维链退化上进行有效性验证。

Result: 在多个前沿模型的挑战性基准测试中发现它们表现出高监控性。

Conclusion: 该方法有助于测量思维链的默认监控性，应被视为对抗性压力测试的补充而非替代，用于测试对抗故意规避模型的鲁棒性。

Abstract: While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) monitoring offers a unique opportunity for AI
safety, this opportunity could be lost through shifts in training practices or
model architecture. To help preserve monitorability, we propose a pragmatic way
to measure two components of it: legibility (whether the reasoning can be
followed by a human) and coverage (whether the CoT contains all the reasoning
needed for a human to also produce the final output). We implement these
metrics with an autorater prompt that enables any capable LLM to compute the
legibility and coverage of existing CoTs. After sanity-checking our prompted
autorater with synthetic CoT degradations, we apply it to several frontier
models on challenging benchmarks, finding that they exhibit high
monitorability. We present these metrics, including our complete autorater
prompt, as a tool for developers to track how design decisions impact
monitorability. While the exact prompt we share is still a preliminary version
under ongoing development, we are sharing it now in the hopes that others in
the community will find it useful. Our method helps measure the default
monitorability of CoT - it should be seen as a complement, not a replacement,
for the adversarial stress-testing needed to test robustness against
deliberately evasive models.

Abstract: The proliferation of probabilistic AI has promoted proposals for specialized
stochastic computers. Despite promising efficiency gains, these proposals have
failed to gain traction because they rely on fundamentally limited modeling
techniques and exotic, unscalable hardware. In this work, we address these
shortcomings by proposing an all-transistor probabilistic computer that
implements powerful denoising models at the hardware level. A system-level
analysis indicates that devices based on our architecture could achieve
performance parity with GPUs on a simple image benchmark using approximately
10,000 times less energy.

TL;DR: DATE方法在扩散模型的每个时间步动态更新文本嵌入，基于中间扰动数据优化文本条件，无需额外训练即可提升文本-图像对齐效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统文本到图像扩散模型使用固定的文本嵌入，无法适应扩散过程中不同时间步的生成需求，限制了文本条件与生成图像的动态对齐能力。

Method: 提出扩散自适应文本嵌入（DATE），在每个扩散时间步基于中间扰动数据动态优化文本嵌入，通过推导的更新规则在采样过程中逐步改进文本条件。

Result: DATE在保持模型生成能力的同时，在多概念生成和文本引导图像编辑等任务中，相比固定文本嵌入实现了更优的文本-图像对齐效果。

Conclusion: DATE方法通过动态调整文本嵌入，有效提升了扩散模型中文本条件的适应性，无需重新训练即可显著改善文本-图像对齐质量。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models rely on text embeddings from a pre-trained
text encoder, but these embeddings remain fixed across all diffusion timesteps,
limiting their adaptability to the generative process. We propose Diffusion
Adaptive Text Embedding (DATE), which dynamically updates text embeddings at
each diffusion timestep based on intermediate perturbed data. We formulate an
optimization problem and derive an update rule that refines the text embeddings
at each sampling step to improve alignment and preference between the mean
predicted image and the text. This allows DATE to dynamically adapts the text
conditions to the reverse-diffused images throughout diffusion sampling without
requiring additional model training. Through theoretical analysis and empirical
results, we show that DATE maintains the generative capability of the model
while providing superior text-image alignment over fixed text embeddings across
various tasks, including multi-concept generation and text-guided image
editing. Our code is available at https://github.com/aailab-kaist/DATE.

TL;DR: SynCast是一个高分辨率神经预测模型，通过整合气象和空气成分数据来改进PM浓度的预测，特别针对极端污染事件。该模型基于区域适应的transformer架构，结合扩散随机精炼模块，在多个PM变量上显示出显著的预测性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 空气污染是全球健康和环境的主要风险，特别是在易受野火、城市雾霾和沙尘暴影响的地区。现有模型往往低估罕见但危险的污染事件，需要更准确的PM浓度预测来支持及时的公共卫生预警和干预。

Method: 构建基于区域适应transformer架构的SynCast模型，集成扩散随机精炼模块，利用ERA5和CAMS数据集，采用领域感知目标和极值理论指导的损失函数。

Result: 模型在多个PM变量（PM1、PM2.5、PM10）上显示出显著的预测保真度提升，特别是在极端条件下。相比传统方法，能更准确地捕捉驱动PM峰值非线性动态。

Conclusion: SynCast为下一代空气质量早期预警系统提供了可扩展的基础，支持脆弱地区的气候健康风险缓解，在不影响全局精度的情况下显著提高了高影响区域的性能。

Abstract: Air pollution remains a leading global health and environmental risk,
particularly in regions vulnerable to episodic air pollution spikes due to
wildfires, urban haze and dust storms. Accurate forecasting of particulate
matter (PM) concentrations is essential to enable timely public health warnings
and interventions, yet existing models often underestimate rare but hazardous
pollution events. Here, we present SynCast, a high-resolution neural
forecasting model that integrates meteorological and air composition data to
improve predictions of both average and extreme pollution levels. Built on a
regionally adapted transformer backbone and enhanced with a diffusion-based
stochastic refinement module, SynCast captures the nonlinear dynamics driving
PM spikes more accurately than existing approaches. Leveraging on harmonized
ERA5 and CAMS datasets, our model shows substantial gains in forecasting
fidelity across multiple PM variables (PM$_1$, PM$_{2.5}$, PM$_{10}$),
especially under extreme conditions. We demonstrate that conventional loss
functions underrepresent distributional tails (rare pollution events) and show
that SynCast, guided by domain-aware objectives and extreme value theory,
significantly enhances performance in highly impacted regions without
compromising global accuracy. This approach provides a scalable foundation for
next-generation air quality early warning systems and supports climate-health
risk mitigation in vulnerable regions.

hyperdimensional computing implementations for a collection of homophilic

methodologies we have tested, on the same target GPU platform, \hdgc is on
average 9561.0 and 144.5 times faster than \gcnii, a graph neural network
implementation and HDGL, a hyperdimensional computing implementation,
respectively. As the majority of the learning operates on binary vectors, we
expect outstanding energy performance of \hdgc on neuromorphic and emerging
process-in-memory devices.

TL;DR: STNet通过谱变换解决算子特征值问题，使用收缩投影和滤波器变换来提高深度学习方法的精度和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法在求解算子特征值问题时性能受限于算子的谱分布，较大的特征值间隙能提高精度，因此需要利用谱分布的定制化谱变换来提升性能。

Method: STNet在每次迭代中使用近似特征值和特征函数对原始算子进行谱变换，将其转化为等效但更易求解的问题。具体包括：使用收缩投影排除已求解特征函数对应的子空间以减少搜索空间；使用滤波器变换放大目标区域的特征值并抑制外部特征值。

Result: 大量实验表明，STNet在精度上持续优于现有的基于学习的方法，达到了最先进的性能水平。

Conclusion: STNet通过谱变换有效提升了算子特征值问题的求解性能，证明了利用算子谱分布信息进行定制化变换的重要性。

Abstract: Operator eigenvalue problems play a critical role in various scientific
fields and engineering applications, yet numerical methods are hindered by the
curse of dimensionality. Recent deep learning methods provide an efficient
approach to address this challenge by iteratively updating neural networks.
These methods' performance relies heavily on the spectral distribution of the
given operator: larger gaps between the operator's eigenvalues will improve
precision, thus tailored spectral transformations that leverage the spectral
distribution can enhance their performance. Based on this observation, we
propose the Spectral Transformation Network (STNet). During each iteration,
STNet uses approximate eigenvalues and eigenfunctions to perform spectral
transformations on the original operator, turning it into an equivalent but
easier problem. Specifically, we employ deflation projection to exclude the
subspace corresponding to already solved eigenfunctions, thereby reducing the
search space and avoiding converging to existing eigenfunctions. Additionally,
our filter transform magnifies eigenvalues in the desired region and suppresses
those outside, further improving performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that STNet consistently outperforms existing learning-based methods, achieving
state-of-the-art performance in accuracy.

Motivation: 组合老虎机扩展了经典老虎机框架，但UCB算法在此背景下存在不足，而臂消除方法难以适应组合设置。需要开发新的消除方案来解决显式探索不足的问题。

Method: 引入新颖的消除方案，将臂分为确认、活跃和消除三类，并加入显式探索来动态更新这些集合。

Result: 在组合图反馈老虎机和组合线性上下文老虎机中，该方法实现了接近最优的遗憾性能，而基于UCB的方法由于显式探索不足可能失败。

Conclusion: 提出的消除算法在组合老虎机设置中有效解决了UCB方法的局限性，提供了匹配的下界证明，为组合老虎机问题提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Combinatorial bandits extend the classical bandit framework to settings where
the learner selects multiple arms in each round, motivated by applications such
as online recommendation and assortment optimization. While extensions of upper
confidence bound (UCB) algorithms arise naturally in this context, adapting arm
elimination methods has proved more challenging. We introduce a novel
elimination scheme that partitions arms into three categories (confirmed,
active, and eliminated), and incorporates explicit exploration to update these
sets. We demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithm in two settings: the
combinatorial multi-armed bandit with general graph feedback, and the
combinatorial linear contextual bandit. In both cases, our approach achieves
near-optimal regret, whereas UCB-based methods can provably fail due to
insufficient explicit exploration. Matching lower bounds are also provided.

Abstract: Accurate, real-time estimation of barge quantity on inland waterways remains
a critical challenge due to the non-self-propelled nature of barges and the
limitations of existing monitoring systems. This study introduces a novel
method to use Automatic Identification System (AIS) vessel tracking data to
predict the number of barges in tow using Machine Learning (ML). To train and
test the model, barge instances were manually annotated from satellite scenes
across the Lower Mississippi River. Labeled images were matched to AIS vessel
tracks using a spatiotemporal matching procedure. A comprehensive set of 30
AIS-derived features capturing vessel geometry, dynamic movement, and
trajectory patterns were created and evaluated using Recursive Feature
Elimination (RFE) to identify the most predictive variables. Six regression
models, including ensemble, kernel-based, and generalized linear approaches,
were trained and evaluated. The Poisson Regressor model yielded the best
performance, achieving a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 1.92 barges using 12 of
the 30 features. The feature importance analysis revealed that metrics
capturing vessel maneuverability such as course entropy, speed variability and
trip length were most predictive of barge count. The proposed approach provides
a scalable, readily implementable method for enhancing Maritime Domain
Awareness (MDA), with strong potential applications in lock scheduling, port
management, and freight planning. Future work will expand the proof of concept
presented here to explore model transferability to other inland rivers with
differing operational and environmental conditions.

Conclusion: STG通过理论证明能够将底层模型分布与安全约束对齐，在保持生成质量的同时实现更安全的输出，为扩散模型的安全应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-image models have recently made significant advances in generating
realistic and semantically coherent images, driven by advanced diffusion models
and large-scale web-crawled datasets. However, these datasets often contain
inappropriate or biased content, raising concerns about the generation of
harmful outputs when provided with malicious text prompts. We propose Safe Text
embedding Guidance (STG), a training-free approach to improve the safety of
diffusion models by guiding the text embeddings during sampling. STG adjusts
the text embeddings based on a safety function evaluated on the expected final
denoised image, allowing the model to generate safer outputs without additional
training. Theoretically, we show that STG aligns the underlying model
distribution with safety constraints, thereby achieving safer outputs while
minimally affecting generation quality. Experiments on various safety
scenarios, including nudity, violence, and artist-style removal, show that STG
consistently outperforms both training-based and training-free baselines in
removing unsafe content while preserving the core semantic intent of input
prompts. Our code is available at https://github.com/aailab-kaist/STG.

Abstract: Understanding the evolution of brain functional networks over time is of
great significance for the analysis of cognitive mechanisms and the diagnosis
of neurological diseases. Existing methods often have difficulty in capturing
the temporal evolution characteristics of connections between specific
functional communities. To this end, this paper proposes a new path-level
trajectory modeling framework (NeuroPathNet) to characterize the dynamic
behavior of connection pathways between brain functional partitions. Based on
medically supported static partitioning schemes (such as Yeo and Smith ICA), we
extract the time series of connection strengths between each pair of functional
partitions and model them using a temporal neural network. We validate the
model performance on three public functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI)
datasets, and the results show that it outperforms existing mainstream methods
in multiple indicators. This study can promote the development of dynamic graph
learning methods for brain network analysis, and provide possible clinical
applications for the diagnosis of neurological diseases.

<details>

Motivation: PINNs的精度严重依赖于配置点的位置，全局采样稳定但计算昂贵，局部采样高效但可能忽略已学习区域，降低鲁棒性。需要结合两者的优势。

Method: 提出GLF采样策略：1）通过按残差反比缩放的高斯噪声扰动训练点生成新配置点；2）引入轻量级线性代理模型近似全局残差分布；3）结合残差自适应采样和残差近似。

Result: 在基准PDE上的大量实验表明，GLF相比全局和局部采样策略，在精度和效率方面都有显著提升。

Conclusion: 该研究为提升PINNs在解决复杂高维PDEs中的可靠性和效率提供了一个实用且可扩展的框架。

Abstract: The accuracy of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) critically depends
on the placement of collocation points, as the PDE loss is approximated through
sampling over the solution domain. Global sampling ensures stability by
covering the entire domain but requires many samples and is computationally
expensive, whereas local sampling improves efficiency by focusing on
high-residual regions but may neglect well-learned areas, reducing robustness.
We propose a Global-Local Fusion (GLF) Sampling Strategy that combines the
strengths of both approaches. Specifically, new collocation points are
generated by perturbing training points with Gaussian noise scaled inversely to
the residual, thereby concentrating samples in difficult regions while
preserving exploration. To further reduce computational overhead, a lightweight
linear surrogate is introduced to approximate the global residual-based
distribution, achieving similar effectiveness at a fraction of the cost.
Together, these components, residual-adaptive sampling and residual-based
approximation, preserve the stability of global methods while retaining the
efficiency of local refinement. Extensive experiments on benchmark PDEs
demonstrate that GLF consistently improves both accuracy and efficiency
compared with global and local sampling strategies. This study provides a
practical and scalable framework for enhancing the reliability and efficiency
of PINNs in solving complex and high-dimensional PDEs.

Abstract: Spatio-Temporal Multivariate time series Forecast (STMF) uses the time series
of $n$ spatially distributed variables in a period of recent past to forecast
their values in a period of near future. It has important applications in
spatio-temporal sensing forecast such as road traffic prediction and air
pollution prediction. Recent papers have addressed a practical problem of
missing variables in the model input, which arises in the sensing applications
where the number $m$ of sensors is far less than the number $n$ of locations to
be monitored, due to budget constraints. We observe that the state of the art
assumes that the $m$ variables (i.e., locations with sensors) in the model
input are pre-determined and the important problem of how to choose the $m$
variables in the input has never been studied. This paper fills the gap by
studying a new problem of STMF with chosen variables, which optimally selects
$m$-out-of-$n$ variables for the model input in order to maximize the forecast
accuracy. We propose a unified framework that jointly performs variable
selection and model optimization for both forecast accuracy and model
efficiency. It consists of three novel technical components: (1) masked
variable-parameter pruning, which progressively prunes less informative
variables and attention parameters through quantile-based masking; (2)
prioritized variable-parameter replay, which replays low-loss past samples to
preserve learned knowledge for model stability; (3) dynamic extrapolation
mechanism, which propagates information from variables selected for the input
to all other variables via learnable spatial embeddings and adjacency
information. Experiments on five real-world datasets show that our work
significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines in both accuracy and
efficiency, demonstrating the effectiveness of joint variable selection and
model optimization.

Abstract: We introduce GraphNet, a dataset of 2.7K real-world deep learning

Abstract: Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) for Combinatorial Optimization (CO) is an
emerging paradigm for solving combinatorial problems using neural networks. In
this paper, we address a central challenge of SSL for CO: solving problems with
discrete constraints. We design an end-to-end differentiable framework that
enables us to solve discrete constrained optimization problems with neural
networks. Concretely, we leverage algorithmic techniques from the literature on
convex geometry and Carath\'eodory's theorem to decompose neural network
outputs into convex combinations of polytope corners that correspond to
feasible sets. This decomposition-based approach enables self-supervised
training but also ensures efficient quality-preserving rounding of the neural
net output into feasible solutions. Extensive experiments in
cardinality-constrained optimization show that our approach can consistently
outperform neural baselines. We further provide worked-out examples of how our
method can be applied beyond cardinality-constrained problems to a diverse set
of combinatorial optimization tasks, including finding independent sets in
graphs, and solving matroid-constrained problems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Two-Stage LKPLO多阶段异常检测框架，通过广义损失函数、核PCA全局阶段和局部聚类阶段，解决传统投影方法依赖固定统计指标和单一数据结构的局限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 克服传统投影异常检测方法的两大局限：依赖固定统计指标和假设单一数据结构，需要更灵活的方法处理复杂数据分布。

Method: 三阶段方法：1) 广义损失函数PLO替代固定指标；2) 核PCA线性化非线性结构；3) 局部聚类处理多模态分布。

Result: 在10个基准数据集上通过5折交叉验证和超参数优化，在复杂结构数据集（如Optdigits多簇数据、Arrhythmia高维数据）上显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 核化与局部化阶段的协同组合对性能提升至关重要，为异常检测问题提供了强大的新工具，强调了混合多阶段架构的重要性。

Abstract: This paper presents Two-Stage LKPLO, a novel multi-stage outlier detection
framework that overcomes the coexisting limitations of conventional
projection-based methods: their reliance on a fixed statistical metric and
their assumption of a single data structure. Our framework uniquely synthesizes
three key concepts: (1) a generalized loss-based outlyingness measure (PLO)
that replaces the fixed metric with flexible, adaptive loss functions like our
proposed SVM-like loss; (2) a global kernel PCA stage to linearize non-linear
data structures; and (3) a subsequent local clustering stage to handle
multi-modal distributions. Comprehensive 5-fold cross-validation experiments on
10 benchmark datasets, with automated hyperparameter optimization, demonstrate
that Two-Stage LKPLO achieves state-of-the-art performance. It significantly
outperforms strong baselines on datasets with challenging structures where
existing methods fail, most notably on multi-cluster data (Optdigits) and
complex, high-dimensional data (Arrhythmia). Furthermore, an ablation study
empirically confirms that the synergistic combination of both the kernelization
and localization stages is indispensable for its superior performance. This
work contributes a powerful new tool for a significant class of outlier
detection problems and underscores the importance of hybrid, multi-stage
architectures.

*Hui Sun,Zheng Xie,Hao-Yuan He,Ming Li*

TL;DR: 提出RED方法通过因果解耦学习减少环境特征分歧，缓解无监督域自适应中的负迁移问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 域自适应中显著的领域偏移会导致负迁移，降低模型性能。研究发现跨域在非因果环境特征上的判别分歧是导致负迁移的关键因素

Method: 通过对抗训练域特定的环境特征提取器，将样本解耦为域不变因果特征和域特定非因果环境特征，然后估计并减少环境分歧

Result: 实验结果表明RED能有效缓解负迁移，并达到最先进的性能

Conclusion: 通过因果解耦学习减少环境特征分歧是解决无监督域自适应中负迁移问题的有效方法

Abstract: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation~(UDA) focuses on transferring knowledge from a
labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain, addressing the challenge
of \emph{domain shift}. Significant domain shifts hinder effective knowledge
transfer, leading to \emph{negative transfer} and deteriorating model
performance. Therefore, mitigating negative transfer is essential. This study
revisits negative transfer through the lens of causally disentangled learning,
emphasizing cross-domain discriminative disagreement on non-causal
environmental features as a critical factor. Our theoretical analysis reveals
that overreliance on non-causal environmental features as the environment
evolves can cause discriminative disagreements~(termed \emph{environmental
disagreement}), thereby resulting in negative transfer. To address this, we
propose Reducing Environmental Disagreement~(RED), which disentangles each
sample into domain-invariant causal features and domain-specific non-causal
environmental features via adversarially training domain-specific environmental
feature extractors in the opposite domains. Subsequently, RED estimates and
reduces environmental disagreement based on domain-specific non-causal
environmental features. Experimental results confirm that RED effectively
mitigates negative transfer and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: CA-GAN是一个专门为表格数据设计的生成框架，通过因果图提取和条件WGAN-GP结合强化学习目标，在保持数据效用、因果关系和隐私保护方面优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有表格数据生成方法（特别是基于GAN的方法）难以捕捉复杂因果关系、保持数据效用并提供可证明的隐私保证，限制了在真实企业环境中的部署。

Method: 采用两步法：1）因果图提取学习数据流形中的因果关系；2）基于因果图结构的条件WGAN-GP，结合强化学习目标对齐真实和生成数据的因果图。

Result: 在14个表格数据集上优于6种最先进方法，在因果保持、效用保持和隐私保持三个核心数据工程指标上表现优异。

Conclusion: CA-GAN为数据工程师提供了一个实用、高性能的解决方案，可生成高质量、符合隐私要求的合成数据集，用于数据库系统基准测试、软件开发加速和安全数据驱动研究。

Abstract: The utility of tabular data for tasks ranging from model training to
large-scale data analysis is often constrained by privacy concerns or
regulatory hurdles. While existing data generation methods, particularly those
based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), have shown promise, they
frequently struggle with capturing complex causal relationship, maintaining
data utility, and providing provable privacy guarantees suitable for enterprise
deployment. We introduce CA-GAN, a novel generative framework specifically
engineered to address these challenges for real-world tabular datasets. CA-GAN
utilizes a two-step approach: causal graph extraction to learn a robust,
comprehensive causal relationship in the data's manifold, followed by a custom
Conditional WGAN-GP (Wasserstein GAN with Gradient Penalty) that operates
exclusively as per the structure of nodes in the causal graph. More
importantly, the generator is trained with a new Reinforcement Learning-based
objective that aligns the causal graphs constructed from real and fake data,
ensuring the causal awareness in both training and sampling phases. We
demonstrate CA-GAN superiority over six SOTA methods across 14 tabular
datasets. Our evaluations, focused on core data engineering metrics: causal
preservation, utility preservation, and privacy preservation. Our method offers
a practical, high-performance solution for data engineers seeking to create
high-quality, privacy-compliant synthetic datasets to benchmark database
systems, accelerate software development, and facilitate secure data-driven
research.

TL;DR: 提出了检索增强预测(RAP)框架，结合深度学习预测能力和历史数据真实演化，通过检索相似历史样本作为动态指导，改善长期预测的物理合理性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度学习模型在长期自回归预测中误差累积导致物理不合理的问题，因为纯参数化方法难以完全捕捉系统内在动力学约束。

Method: RAP框架从大规模数据库中检索与当前状态最相似的历史样本，将其真实未来演化作为参考目标，通过双流架构作为条件输入提供动态指导。

Result: 在气象学、湍流和火灾模拟等多个基准测试中，RAP不仅超越最先进方法，还显著优于仅使用类比预测的基线，有效抑制长期预测中的误差发散。

Conclusion: RAP通过结合参数化深度学习和非参数化历史数据检索，能够生成更物理合理的预测，为复杂物理系统的长期时空预测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate and long-term spatiotemporal prediction for complex physical systems
remains a fundamental challenge in scientific computing. While deep learning
models, as powerful parametric approximators, have shown remarkable success,
they suffer from a critical limitation: the accumulation of errors during
long-term autoregressive rollouts often leads to physically implausible
artifacts. This deficiency arises from their purely parametric nature, which
struggles to capture the full constraints of a system's intrinsic dynamics. To
address this, we introduce a novel \textbf{Retrieval-Augmented Prediction
(RAP)} framework, a hybrid paradigm that synergizes the predictive power of
deep networks with the grounded truth of historical data. The core philosophy
of RAP is to leverage historical evolutionary exemplars as a non-parametric
estimate of the system's local dynamics. For any given state, RAP efficiently
retrieves the most similar historical analog from a large-scale database. The
true future evolution of this analog then serves as a \textbf{reference
target}. Critically, this target is not a hard constraint in the loss function
but rather a powerful conditional input to a specialized dual-stream
architecture. It provides strong \textbf{dynamic guidance}, steering the
model's predictions towards physically viable trajectories. In extensive
benchmarks across meteorology, turbulence, and fire simulation, RAP not only
surpasses state-of-the-art methods but also significantly outperforms a strong
\textbf{analog-only forecasting baseline}. More importantly, RAP generates
predictions that are more physically realistic by effectively suppressing error
divergence in long-term rollouts.

TL;DR: FolDE是一种主动学习辅助定向进化方法，通过自然性预热启动和恒定谎言批次选择器，在蛋白质优化中比现有方法发现更多优质突变体。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统蛋白质优化方法成本高昂，现有ALDE方法在每轮选择最高预测突变体时会产生同质化训练数据，影响后续预测模型的准确性。

Method: FolDE采用自然性预热启动（利用蛋白质语言模型输出增强有限活性测量）和恒定谎言批次选择器（提高批次多样性）来最大化优化效果。

Result: 在20个蛋白质目标的模拟中，FolDE比最佳基线ALDE方法多发现23%的前10%突变体（p=0.005），找到前1%突变体的可能性高55%。

Conclusion: FolDE通过改进的预热启动和批次选择策略，显著提高了蛋白质定向进化的效率，该方法已作为开源软件提供，使高效蛋白质优化对所有实验室都可访问。

Abstract: Proteins are traditionally optimized through the costly construction and
measurement of many mutants. Active Learning-assisted Directed Evolution (ALDE)
alleviates that cost by predicting the best improvements and iteratively
testing mutants to inform predictions. However, existing ALDE methods face a
critical limitation: selecting the highest-predicted mutants in each round
yields homogeneous training data insufficient for accurate prediction models in
subsequent rounds. Here we present FolDE, an ALDE method designed to maximize
end-of-campaign success. In simulations across 20 protein targets, FolDE
discovers 23% more top 10% mutants than the best baseline ALDE method (p=0.005)
and is 55% more likely to find top 1% mutants. FolDE achieves this primarily
through naturalness-based warm-starting, which augments limited activity
measurements with protein language model outputs to improve activity
prediction. We also introduce a constant-liar batch selector, which improves
batch diversity; this is important in multi-mutation campaigns but had limited
effect in our benchmarks. The complete workflow is freely available as
open-source software, making efficient protein optimization accessible to any
laboratory.

TL;DR: FALQON是一个消除FP8量化LoRA微调开销的框架，通过直接合并LoRA适配器到FP8量化主干中，实现3倍训练加速，无需后训练量化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FP8量化主要对大维矩阵乘法加速有效，但在LoRA微调中由于小维矩阵和量化开销，速度提升有限。

Method: 提出FALQON框架：1）直接合并LoRA适配器到FP8量化主干；2）重构前向和反向计算减少量化开销；3）引入行级代理更新机制。

Result: 实验显示FALQON比现有量化LoRA方法快约3倍，精度相当，提供端到端FP8工作流。

Conclusion: FALQON为大规模模型高效微调提供了实用解决方案，消除了量化开销并简化部署流程。

Abstract: Low-bit floating-point (FP) formats, such as FP8, provide significant
acceleration and memory savings in model training thanks to native hardware
support on modern GPUs and NPUs. However, we analyze that FP8 quantization
offers speedup primarily for large-dimensional matrix multiplications, while
inherent quantization overheads diminish speedup when applied to low-rank
adaptation (LoRA), which uses small-dimensional matrices for efficient
fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs). To address this limitation, we
propose FALQON, a novel framework that eliminates the quantization overhead
from separate LoRA computational paths by directly merging LoRA adapters into
an FP8-quantized backbone during fine-tuning. Furthermore, we reformulate the
forward and backward computations for merged adapters to significantly reduce
quantization overhead, and introduce a row-wise proxy update mechanism that
efficiently integrates substantial updates into the quantized backbone.
Experimental evaluations demonstrate that FALQON achieves approximately a
3$\times$ training speedup over existing quantized LoRA methods with a similar
level of accuracy, providing a practical solution for efficient large-scale
model fine-tuning. Moreover, FALQON's end-to-end FP8 workflow removes the need
for post-training quantization, facilitating efficient deployment. Code is

Motivation: 受高斯设置中I-MMSE恒等式的启发，旨在为离散扩散模型建立类似的信息理论框架，证明常用的损失函数不仅是变分边界，而是紧致且原理性的对数似然估计器。

Method: 推导了信息-最小去噪分数熵关系，连接数据与其扩散版本之间的互信息与最小去噪分数熵损失；扩展到掩码扩散，建立信息-最小去噪交叉熵关系；提供时间积分分解的对数似然公式。

Result: 实验在合成和真实世界数据上验证了估计器的准确性、方差稳定性和实用性；实现了时间无关公式、条件似然估计和耦合蒙特卡洛似然比估计等实际扩展。

Conclusion: 该框架为离散扩散模型提供了信息理论基础，证明了常用损失函数是紧致的对数似然估计器，并支持多种实际应用扩展。

Abstract: We present an information-theoretic framework for discrete diffusion models
that yields principled estimators of log-likelihood using score-matching
losses. Inspired by the I-MMSE identity for the Gaussian setup, we derive
analogous results for the discrete setting. Specifically, we introduce the
Information-Minimum Denoising Score Entropy (I-MDSE) relation, which links
mutual information between data and its diffused version to the minimum
denoising score entropy (DSE) loss. We extend this theory to masked diffusion
and establish the Information-Minimum Denoising Cross-Entropy (I-MDCE)
relation, connecting cross-entropy losses to mutual information in discrete
masked processes. These results provide a time-integral decomposition of the
log-likelihood of the data in terms of optimal score-based losses, showing that
commonly used losses such as DSE and DCE are not merely variational bounds but
tight and principled estimators of log-likelihood. The I-MDCE decomposition
further enables practical extensions, including time-free formula, conditional
likelihood estimation in prompt-response tasks, and coupled Monte Carlo
estimation of likelihood ratios. Experiments on synthetic and real-world data
confirm the accuracy, variance stability, and utility of our estimators. The
code is publicly available at https://github.com/Dongjae0324/infodis.

TL;DR: 提出Graph-Guided Concept Selection (G2ConS)方法，通过选择重要文档块和构建概念图来降低基于图的RAG知识图谱构建成本，同时保持检索效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于图的RAG方法在构建知识图谱时需要大量LLM调用来提取实体和关系，导致高昂成本，限制了其在大规模应用中的可行性。

Method: 包含两个核心组件：1) 文档块选择方法，选择重要文档块以减少KG构建成本；2) LLM无关的概念图，在零成本下弥补因块选择引入的知识缺口。

Result: 在多个真实世界数据集上的评估显示，G2ConS在构建成本、检索效果和回答质量方面均优于所有基线方法。

Conclusion: G2ConS通过智能的块选择和概念图构建，有效解决了基于图RAG方法的高成本问题，为大规模应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Graph-based RAG constructs a knowledge graph (KG) from text chunks to enhance
retrieval in Large Language Model (LLM)-based question answering. It is
especially beneficial in domains such as biomedicine, law, and political
science, where effective retrieval often involves multi-hop reasoning over
proprietary documents. However, these methods demand numerous LLM calls to
extract entities and relations from text chunks, incurring prohibitive costs at
scale. Through a carefully designed ablation study, we observe that certain
words (termed concepts) and their associated documents are more important.
Based on this insight, we propose Graph-Guided Concept Selection (G2ConS). Its
core comprises a chunk selection method and an LLM-independent concept graph.
The former selects salient document chunks to reduce KG construction costs; the
latter closes knowledge gaps introduced by chunk selection at zero cost.
Evaluations on multiple real-world datasets show that G2ConS outperforms all
baselines in construction cost, retrieval effectiveness, and answering quality.

<details>

Motivation: 尽管上下文学习在大型语言模型(LLMs)中已被广泛研究，但在视觉语言模型(VLMs)中的有效性仍未充分探索。

Method: 评估了四种架构的七个模型在三个图像描述基准上的表现，分析了提示设计、架构选择和训练策略对多模态ICL的影响，并首次分析了注意力模式随上下文示例数量的变化。

Result: 图像-文本交错数据训练能提升ICL性能，但不意味着能有效整合演示示例的视觉和文本信息；指令调优改善了指令跟随能力，但可能减少对上下文示例的依赖；注意力分析显示当前VLMs主要关注文本线索。

Conclusion: 当前VLMs在上下文学习能力上存在关键限制，为增强其从多模态上下文示例中学习的能力提供了见解。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to learn tasks
from demonstration examples without parameter updates. Although it has been
extensively studied in LLMs, its effectiveness in Vision-Language Models (VLMs)
remains underexplored. In this work, we present a systematic study of ICL in
VLMs, evaluating seven models spanning four architectures on three image
captioning benchmarks. We analyze how prompt design, architectural choices, and
training strategies influence multimodal ICL. To our knowledge, we are the
first to analyze how attention patterns in VLMs vary with an increasing number
of in-context demonstrations. Our results reveal that training on imag-text
interleaved data enhances ICL performance but does not imply effective
integration of visual and textual information from demonstration examples. In
contrast, instruction tuning improves instruction-following but can reduce
reliance on in-context demonstrations, suggesting a trade-off between
instruction alignment and in-context adaptation. Attention analyses further
show that current VLMs primarily focus on textual cues and fail to leverage
visual information, suggesting a limited capacity for multimodal integration.
These findings highlight key limitations in the ICL abilities of current VLMs
and provide insights for enhancing their ability to learn from multimodal
in-context examples.

Conclusion: 因果CNN与FIR滤波器的等价性为理解CNN在稀疏频率信号上的频谱学习行为提供了新见解，适用于动态响应物理系统的建模和识别。

Abstract: This study investigates the behavior of Causal Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs) with quasi-linear activation functions when applied to time-series data
characterized by multimodal frequency content. We demonstrate that, once
trained, such networks exhibit properties analogous to Finite Impulse Response
(FIR) filters, particularly when the convolutional kernels are of extended
length exceeding those typically employed in standard CNN architectures. Causal
CNNs are shown to capture spectral features both implicitly and explicitly,
offering enhanced interpretability for tasks involving dynamic systems.
Leveraging the associative property of convolution, we further show that the
entire network can be reduced to an equivalent single-layer filter resembling
an FIR filter optimized via least-squares criteria. This equivalence yields new
insights into the spectral learning behavior of CNNs trained on signals with
sparse frequency content. The approach is validated on both simulated beam
dynamics and real-world bridge vibration datasets, underlining its relevance
for modeling and identifying physical systems governed by dynamic responses.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of electric vehicles has intensified the need for
accurate and efficient diagnosis of lithium-ion batteries. Parameter
identification of electrochemical battery models is widely recognized as a
powerful method for battery health assessment. However, conventional
metaheuristic approaches suffer from high computational cost and slow
convergence, and recent machine learning methods are limited by their reliance
on constant current data, which may not be available in practice. To overcome
these challenges, we propose deep learning-based framework for parameter
identification of electrochemical battery models. The proposed framework
combines a neural surrogate model of the single particle model with electrolyte
(NeuralSPMe) and a deep learning-based fixed-point iteration method. NeuralSPMe
is trained on realistic EV load profiles to accurately predict lithium
concentration dynamics under dynamic operating conditions while a parameter
update network (PUNet) performs fixed-point iterative updates to significantly
reduce both the evaluation time per sample and the overall number of iterations
required for convergence. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that the
proposed framework accelerates the parameter identification by more than 2000
times, achieves superior sample efficiency and more than 10 times higher
accuracy compared to conventional metaheuristic algorithms, particularly under
dynamic load scenarios encountered in practical applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在异构数据联邦学习中，本地模型会收敛到各自的局部最优解，偏离全局数据分布。FedAvg等聚合方法会产生客户端漂移，导致对大多数客户端次优的更新。个性化联邦学习方法只关注本地性能，但忽略了FedAvg带来的泛化能力这一重要鲁棒性优势。

Method: 提出了FLIU方法，在FedAvg基础上增加简单的个性化步骤，使用自适应个性化因子。在不同分布条件下（包括IID、病理性非IID和新的Dirichlet分布）对MNIST和CIFAR-10进行实证评估，分析单个通信轮次中的不同阶段。

Result: 通过实验评估了各种联邦学习方法的本地性能和泛化能力，FLIU方法在复杂数据异构环境下表现出色。

Conclusion: FLIU方法有效解决了客户端漂移问题，同时保持了良好的泛化能力，在异构数据联邦学习环境中具有实用价值。

Abstract: In the context of Federated Learning with heterogeneous data environments,
local models tend to converge to their own local model optima during local
training steps, deviating from the overall data distributions. Aggregation of
these local updates, e.g., with FedAvg, often does not align with the global
model optimum (client drift), resulting in an update that is suboptimal for
most clients. Personalized Federated Learning approaches address this challenge
by exclusively focusing on the average local performances of clients' models on
their own data distribution. Generalization to out-of-distribution samples,
which is a substantial benefit of FedAvg and represents a significant component
of robustness, appears to be inadequately incorporated into the assessment and
evaluation processes. This study involves a thorough evaluation of Federated
Learning approaches, encompassing both their local performance and their
generalization capabilities. Therefore, we examine different stages within a
single communication round to enable a more nuanced understanding of the
considered metrics. Furthermore, we propose and incorporate a modified approach
of FedAvg, designated as Federated Learning with Individualized Updates (FLIU),
extending the algorithm by a straightforward individualization step with an
adaptive personalization factor. We evaluate and compare the approaches
empirically using MNIST and CIFAR-10 under various distributional conditions,
including benchmark IID and pathological non-IID, as well as additional novel
test environments with Dirichlet distribution specifically developed to stress
the algorithms on complex data heterogeneity.

Result: 应用于聚合物拉伸和随机梯度Langevin动力学，揭示了新的见解：势垒高度的超线性缩放、熵产生率的亚线性缩放，以及随着批量大小增加不可逆性被抑制。

Conclusion: I-OnsagerNet建立了一个通用的数据驱动框架，用于发现和解释非平衡动力学。

Abstract: Complex dissipative systems appear across science and engineering, from
polymers and active matter to learning algorithms. These systems operate far
from equilibrium, where energy dissipation and time irreversibility are key to
their behavior, but are difficult to quantify from data. Learning accurate and
interpretable models of such dynamics remains a major challenge: the models
must be expressive enough to describe diverse processes, yet constrained enough
to remain physically meaningful and mathematically identifiable. Here, we
introduce I-OnsagerNet, a neural framework that learns dissipative stochastic
dynamics directly from trajectories while ensuring both interpretability and
uniqueness. I-OnsagerNet extends the Onsager principle to guarantee that the
learned potential is obtained from the stationary density and that the drift
decomposes cleanly into time-reversible and time-irreversible components, as
dictated by the Helmholtz decomposition. Our approach enables us to calculate
the entropy production and to quantify irreversibility, offering a principled
way to detect and quantify deviations from equilibrium. Applications to polymer
stretching in elongational flow and to stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics
reveal new insights, including super-linear scaling of barrier heights and
sub-linear scaling of entropy production rates with the strain rate, and the
suppression of irreversibility with increasing batch size. I-OnsagerNet thus
establishes a general, data-driven framework for discovering and interpreting
non-equilibrium dynamics.

Conclusion: EddyFormer结合了谱方法的精度和Transformer的可扩展性，为大规模湍流模拟提供了高效准确的解决方案，展示了良好的领域泛化能力。

Abstract: Computationally resolving turbulence remains a central challenge in fluid
dynamics due to its multi-scale interactions. Fully resolving large-scale
turbulence through direct numerical simulation (DNS) is computationally
prohibitive, motivating data-driven machine learning alternatives. In this
work, we propose EddyFormer, a Transformer-based spectral-element (SEM)
architecture for large-scale turbulence simulation that combines the accuracy
of spectral methods with the scalability of the attention mechanism. We
introduce an SEM tokenization that decomposes the flow into grid-scale and
subgrid-scale components, enabling capture of both local and global features.
We create a new three-dimensional isotropic turbulence dataset and train
EddyFormer to achieves DNS-level accuracy at 256^3 resolution, providing a 30x
speedup over DNS. When applied to unseen domains up to 4x larger than in
training, EddyFormer preserves accuracy on physics-invariant metrics-energy
spectra, correlation functions, and structure functions-showing domain
generalization. On The Well benchmark suite of diverse turbulent flows,
EddyFormer resolves cases where prior ML models fail to converge, accurately
reproducing complex dynamics across a wide range of physical conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有字幕生成方法存在同步性差、文本错误、格式不一致、阅读速度不当等问题，且通常只能解决孤立问题，导致后期编辑工作繁重耗时。

Method: 结合大型语言模型(LLM)、视觉语言模型(VLM)、图像处理和自动语音识别(ASR)，利用音频和视频的上下文信息进行字幕质量检测和修正。

Result: 字幕质量显著提升，SUBER分数从9.6降至3.54，图像模式问题的F1分数达到约0.80。

Conclusion: V-SAT提供了首个全面的字幕标注解决方案，通过人机协同验证确保高质量结果。

Abstract: The surge of audiovisual content on streaming platforms and social media has
heightened the demand for accurate and accessible subtitles. However, existing
subtitle generation methods primarily speech-based transcription or OCR-based
extraction suffer from several shortcomings, including poor synchronization,
incorrect or harmful text, inconsistent formatting, inappropriate reading
speeds, and the inability to adapt to dynamic audio-visual contexts. Current
approaches often address isolated issues, leaving post-editing as a
labor-intensive and time-consuming process. In this paper, we introduce V-SAT
(Video Subtitle Annotation Tool), a unified framework that automatically
detects and corrects a wide range of subtitle quality issues. By combining
Large Language Models(LLMs), Vision-Language Models (VLMs), Image Processing,
and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), V-SAT leverages contextual cues from
both audio and video. Subtitle quality improved, with the SUBER score reduced
from 9.6 to 3.54 after resolving all language mode issues and F1-scores of
~0.80 for image mode issues. Human-in-the-loop validation ensures high-quality
results, providing the first comprehensive solution for robust subtitle
annotation.

TL;DR: SPEAR++攻击改进了原有的SPEAR梯度反演攻击，通过应用稀疏字典学习技术，使线性层与ReLU激活的梯度反演问题变得可处理，将适用批次大小提高了10倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习虽然实现了分布式训练而无需显式数据共享，但梯度反演攻击挑战了其隐私保护特性。现有的SPEAR攻击虽然理论突破，但指数级运行时限制了其实际应用。

Method: 应用最先进的稀疏字典学习技术来处理线性层与ReLU激活的梯度反演问题，使其在计算上变得可行。

Result: SPEAR++保持了SPEAR的所有理想特性（如对DP噪声和FedAvg聚合的鲁棒性），同时能够处理比原来大10倍的批次大小。

Conclusion: SPEAR++显著提高了梯度反演攻击的实用性，使联邦学习系统的隐私漏洞评估更加可行和高效。

Abstract: Federated Learning has seen an increased deployment in real-world scenarios
recently, as it enables the distributed training of machine learning models
without explicit data sharing between individual clients. Yet, the introduction
of the so-called gradient inversion attacks has fundamentally challenged its
privacy-preserving properties. Unfortunately, as these attacks mostly rely on
direct data optimization without any formal guarantees, the vulnerability of
real-world systems remains in dispute and requires tedious testing for each new
federated deployment. To overcome these issues, recently the SPEAR attack was
introduced, which is based on a theoretical analysis of the gradients of linear
layers with ReLU activations. While SPEAR is an important theoretical
breakthrough, the attack's practicality was severely limited by its exponential
runtime in the batch size b. In this work, we fill this gap by applying
State-of-the-Art techniques from Sparsely-Used Dictionary Learning to make the
problem of gradient inversion on linear layers with ReLU activations tractable.
Our experiments demonstrate that our new attack, SPEAR++, retains all desirable
properties of SPEAR, such as robustness to DP noise and FedAvg aggregation,
while being applicable to 10x bigger batch sizes.

Motivation: 传统数值方法计算成本高，现代数据驱动方法面临数据稀缺和分布偏移问题，需要解决这些基本限制。

Method: 使用重构自编码器构建物理状态字典，在潜在空间进行原则性插值生成新样本，结合傅里叶增强图ODE进行预测建模。

Conclusion: 物理引导的增强范式在解决数据稀缺和分布偏移问题上具有显著效果，证明了该方法的有效性。

Abstract: In dynamical system modeling, traditional numerical methods are limited by
high computational costs, while modern data-driven approaches struggle with
data scarcity and distribution shifts. To address these fundamental
limitations, we first propose SPARK, a physics-guided quantitative augmentation
plugin. Specifically, SPARK utilizes a reconstruction autoencoder to integrate
physical parameters into a physics-rich discrete state dictionary. This state
dictionary then acts as a structured dictionary of physical states, enabling
the creation of new, physically-plausible training samples via principled
interpolation in the latent space. Further, for downstream prediction, these
augmented representations are seamlessly integrated with a Fourier-enhanced
Graph ODE, a combination designed to robustly model the enriched data
distribution while capturing long-term temporal dependencies. Extensive
experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that SPARK significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, particularly in challenging
out-of-distribution scenarios and data-scarce regimes, proving the efficacy of
our physics-guided augmentation paradigm.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ICU数据质量差，生命体征数据存在大量缺失段，影响机器学习预测性能，需要比较不同插补方法以确定最佳实践

Method: 创建可扩展的基准测试框架，包含15种插补方法和4种截断方法，在主要ICU数据集上进行基准测试

Result: 提供了各种插补方法的比较结果，帮助研究人员选择最准确的插补技术

Conclusion: 该基准测试为ICU数据插补提供了比较基础，有助于推动更多机器学习模型进入临床实践

Abstract: As more Intensive Care Unit (ICU) data becomes available, the interest in
developing clinical prediction models to improve healthcare protocols
increases. However, the lack of data quality still hinders clinical prediction
using Machine Learning (ML). Many vital sign measurements, such as heart rate,
contain sizeable missing segments, leaving gaps in the data that could
negatively impact prediction performance. Previous works have introduced
numerous time-series imputation techniques. Nevertheless, more comprehensive
work is needed to compare a representative set of methods for imputing ICU
vital signs and determine the best practice. In reality, ad-hoc imputation
techniques that could decrease prediction accuracy, like zero imputation, are
still used. In this work, we compare established imputation techniques to guide
researchers in improving the performance of clinical prediction models by
selecting the most accurate imputation technique. We introduce an extensible
and reusable benchmark with currently 15 imputation and 4 amputation methods,
created for benchmarking on major ICU datasets. We hope to provide a
comparative basis and facilitate further ML development to bring more models
into clinical practice.

TL;DR: PRIVET是一种基于样本的隐私泄露检测算法，使用极值统计和最近邻距离来为每个合成样本分配个体隐私泄露分数，能够跨多种数据模态可靠地检测记忆化和隐私泄露。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度生成模型常在敏感数据上训练，引发隐私保护合成数据的需求。现有方法主要依赖全局标准评估隐私风险，缺乏样本级的可解释评估，限制了合成数据在实际应用中的部署。

Method: 使用极值统计和最近邻距离，提出PRIVET算法，为每个合成样本分配个体隐私泄露分数。该方法与数据模态无关，适用于高维数据和有限样本情况。

Result: PRIVET在各种数据模态中可靠地检测记忆化和隐私泄露，包括高维设置、有限样本的遗传数据，甚至在欠拟合情况下也有效。相比现有方法，在受控设置下显示出优势。

Conclusion: PRIVET提供数据集级和样本级的隐私评估，通过定性和定量输出增强实用性。同时发现现有计算机视觉嵌入在识别近重复样本时存在感知距离意义的局限性。

Abstract: Deep generative models are often trained on sensitive data, such as genetic
sequences, health data, or more broadly, any copyrighted, licensed or protected
content. This raises critical concerns around privacy-preserving synthetic
data, and more specifically around privacy leakage, an issue closely tied to
overfitting. Existing methods almost exclusively rely on global criteria to
estimate the risk of privacy failure associated to a model, offering only
quantitative non interpretable insights. The absence of rigorous evaluation
methods for data privacy at the sample-level may hinder the practical
deployment of synthetic data in real-world applications. Using extreme value
statistics on nearest-neighbor distances, we propose PRIVET, a generic
sample-based, modality-agnostic algorithm that assigns an individual privacy
leak score to each synthetic sample. We empirically demonstrate that PRIVET
reliably detects instances of memorization and privacy leakage across diverse
data modalities, including settings with very high dimensionality, limited
sample sizes such as genetic data and even under underfitting regimes. We
compare our method to existing approaches under controlled settings and show
its advantage in providing both dataset level and sample level assessments
through qualitative and quantitative outputs. Additionally, our analysis
reveals limitations in existing computer vision embeddings to yield
perceptually meaningful distances when identifying near-duplicate samples.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有算法要么在数据丰富时最优但维度依赖，要么在数据稀缺时维度独立但遗憾界较差，需要一种能同时适应两种情况的算法

Method: 使用稀疏乐观信息导向采样，通过时间依赖的学习率来平衡信息和遗憾

Result: SOIDS在数据丰富和数据稀缺两种情况下都能达到最优最坏情况遗憾，理论结果扩展了IDS的保证

Conclusion: SOIDS是首个能同时在数据丰富和数据稀缺情况下达到最优最坏情况遗憾的算法，实验验证了其良好性能

Abstract: Many high-dimensional online decision-making problems can be modeled as
stochastic sparse linear bandits. Most existing algorithms are designed to
achieve optimal worst-case regret in either the data-rich regime, where
polynomial dependence on the ambient dimension is unavoidable, or the data-poor
regime, where dimension-independence is possible at the cost of worse
dependence on the number of rounds. In contrast, the sparse Information
Directed Sampling (IDS) algorithm satisfies a Bayesian regret bound that has
the optimal rate in both regimes simultaneously. In this work, we explore the
use of Sparse Optimistic Information Directed Sampling (SOIDS) to achieve the
same adaptivity in the worst-case setting, without Bayesian assumptions.
Through a novel analysis that enables the use of a time-dependent learning
rate, we show that SOIDS can optimally balance information and regret. Our
results extend the theoretical guarantees of IDS, providing the first algorithm
that simultaneously achieves optimal worst-case regret in both the data-rich
and data-poor regimes. We empirically demonstrate the good performance of
SOIDS.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了PaTaRM框架，通过偏好感知奖励机制和动态评分标准适配，统一了成对和点对奖励模型训练方法，在多个基准测试中显著提升了奖励模型和下游RLHF性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统奖励模型存在局限性：成对方法依赖二元标签导致推理不匹配，点对方法需要复杂标注且适应性差。需要一种统一框架来解决这些问题。

Method: PaTaRM结合偏好感知奖励机制和动态评分标准适配，利用成对数据构建点对训练信号，无需显式点对标签，同时为全局任务一致性和实例级细粒度推理生成评估标准。

Result: 在RewardBench和RMBench上平均相对提升4.7%，在IFEval和InFoBench基准测试中下游RLHF性能平均提升13.6%。

Conclusion: PaTaRM为RLHF提供了高效、可泛化且可解释的奖励建模方法，证实了其有效性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Reward models (RMs) are central to reinforcement learning from human feedback
(RLHF), providing the critical supervision signals that align large language
models (LLMs) with human preferences. While generative reward models (GRMs)
offer greater interpretability than traditional scalar RMs, current training
paradigms remain limited. Pair-wise methods rely on binary good-versus-bad
labels, which cause mismatches for point-wise inference and necessitate complex
pairing strategies for effective application in RLHF. On the other hand,
point-wise methods require more elaborate absolute labeling with rubric-driven
criteria, resulting in poor adaptability and high annotation costs. In this
work, we propose the Preference-Aware Task-Adaptive Reward Model (PaTaRM), a
unified framework that integrates a preference-aware reward (PAR) mechanism
with dynamic rubric adaptation. PaTaRM leverages relative preference
information from pairwise data to construct robust point-wise training signals,
eliminating the need for explicit point-wise labels. Simultaneously, it employs
a task-adaptive rubric system that flexibly generates evaluation criteria for
both global task consistency and instance-specific fine-grained reasoning. This
design enables efficient, generalizable, and interpretable reward modeling for
RLHF. Extensive experiments show that PaTaRM achieves an average relative
improvement of 4.7% on RewardBench and RMBench across Qwen3-8B and Qwen3-14B
models. Furthermore, PaTaRM boosts downstream RLHF performance, with an average
improvement of 13.6% across IFEval and InFoBench benchmarks, confirming its
effectiveness and robustness. Our code is available at

Method: 扩展了基于规则的TLogic框架，新规则格式将实体类别作为关键组件，限制规则仅应用于相关实体。当构建图谱时类别未知时，提出使用基于LLM的数据驱动方法生成类别，并研究类别预测中检索实体得分聚合方法的选择。

Result: 该方法在保持高准确率的同时提供了可解释的预测，通过实体类别限制提高了规则应用的精确性。

Conclusion: 提出的基于规则的扩展框架在时序知识图谱预测中实现了准确性和可解释性的平衡，实体类别的引入增强了规则应用的针对性，LLM方法为类别生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Temporal Knowledge Graphs have emerged as a powerful way of not only modeling
static relationships between entities but also the dynamics of how relations
evolve over time. As these informational structures can be used to store
information from a real-world setting, such as a news flow, predicting future
graph components to a certain extent equates predicting real-world events. Most
of the research in this field focuses on embedding-based methods, often
leveraging convolutional neural net architectures. These solutions act as black
boxes, limiting insight. In this paper, we explore an extension to an
established rule-based framework, TLogic, that yields a high accuracy in
combination with explainable predictions. This offers transparency and allows
the end-user to critically evaluate the rules applied at the end of the
prediction stage. The new rule format incorporates entity category as a key
component with the purpose of limiting rule application only to relevant
entities. When categories are unknown for building the graph, we propose a
data-driven method to generate them with an LLM-based approach. Additionally,
we investigate the choice of aggregation method for scores of retrieved
entities when performing category prediction.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出SALS框架，通过将KV缓存投影到紧凑的潜在空间并进行稀疏token选择，有效压缩KV缓存并提升推理速度，在保持准确性的同时实现6.4倍压缩和5.7倍加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在处理长上下文时面临KV缓存过大和内存带宽需求高的问题，现有低秩压缩方法因RoPE机制导致精度下降或速度瓶颈。

Method: SALS框架：1）将KV缓存通过低秩投影到紧凑潜在空间；2）在该空间中进行RoPE无关的查询-键交互以选择重要token；3）仅重建少量重要token以避免全缓存重建开销。

Result: 在LLaMA2-7b-chat、Mistral-7b和LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct上验证，SALS实现6.4倍KV缓存压缩，注意力算子比FlashAttention2快5.7倍，端到端吞吐量比GPT-fast在4k和32K序列上分别提升1.4倍和4.5倍。

Conclusion: SALS通过潜在空间稀疏注意力有效解决了KV缓存压缩问题，在保持模型精度的同时显著提升了推理效率，适用于长上下文处理场景。

Abstract: Large Language Models capable of handling extended contexts are in high
demand, yet their inference remains challenging due to substantial Key-Value
cache size and high memory bandwidth requirements. Previous research has
demonstrated that KV cache exhibits low-rank characteristics within the hidden
dimension, suggesting the potential for effective compression. However, due to
the widely adopted Rotary Position Embedding mechanism in modern LLMs, naive
low-rank compression suffers severe accuracy degradation or creates a new speed
bottleneck, as the low-rank cache must first be reconstructed in order to apply
RoPE. In this paper, we introduce two key insights: first, the application of
RoPE to the key vectors increases their variance, which in turn results in a
higher rank; second, after the key vectors are transformed into the latent
space, they largely maintain their representation across most layers. Based on
these insights, we propose the Sparse Attention in Latent Space framework. SALS
projects the KV cache into a compact latent space via low-rank projection, and
performs sparse token selection using RoPE-free query-key interactions in this
space. By reconstructing only a small subset of important tokens, it avoids the
overhead of full KV cache reconstruction. We comprehensively evaluate SALS on
various tasks using two large-scale models: LLaMA2-7b-chat and Mistral-7b, and
additionally verify its scalability on the RULER-128k benchmark with
LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct. Experimental results demonstrate that SALS achieves SOTA
performance by maintaining competitive accuracy. Under different settings, SALS
achieves 6.4-fold KV cache compression and 5.7-fold speed-up in the attention
operator compared to FlashAttention2 on the 4K sequence. For the end-to-end
throughput performance, we achieves 1.4-fold and 4.5-fold improvement compared
to GPT-fast on 4k and 32K sequences, respectively.

Motivation: 方程发现在回归任务中已取得显著成功，但在分类任务中的应用相对较少。本文旨在将方程发现技术扩展到二元分类领域，寻找能够明确描述决策边界的可解释模型。

Method: 使用适度复杂度的语法构建模型，包含线性项、二次项、指数项以及特征乘积项（用于捕捉XOR类依赖关系），通过可配置的语法模式发现决策边界的解析函数。

Result: 在二元分类任务中，EDC方法能够同时发现目标方程的结构和参数值，性能优于现有的基于方程发现的分类方法，并与二元分类领域的最先进方法表现相当。

Conclusion: 提出的EDC框架成功将方程发现技术应用于二元分类，通过可配置的语法模式实现了灵活但不至于过拟合的决策边界建模，为可解释分类模型提供了新思路。

Abstract: Equation Discovery techniques have shown considerable success in regression
tasks, where they are used to discover concise and interpretable models
(\textit{Symbolic Regression}). In this paper, we propose a new ED-based binary
classification framework. Our proposed method EDC finds analytical functions of
manageable size that specify the location and shape of the decision boundary.
In extensive experiments on artificial and real-life data, we demonstrate how
EDC is able to discover both the structure of the target equation as well as
the value of its parameters, outperforming the current state-of-the-art
ED-based classification methods in binary classification and achieving
performance comparable to the state of the art in binary classification. We
suggest a grammar of modest complexity that appears to work well on the tested
datasets but argue that the exact grammar -- and thus the complexity of the
models -- is configurable, and especially domain-specific expressions can be
included in the pattern language, where that is required. The presented grammar
consists of a series of summands (additive terms) that include linear,
quadratic and exponential terms, as well as products of two features (producing
hyperbolic curves ideal for capturing XOR-like dependencies). The experiments
demonstrate that this grammar allows fairly flexible decision boundaries while
not so rich to cause overfitting.

Motivation: 传统贝叶斯聚类方法计算成本高，且现实数据常含缺失值，简单插补会忽略不确定性导致结果不佳。

Method: 扩展Prior-Data Fitted Networks到无监督贝叶斯聚类，完全在有限高斯混合模型先验生成的合成数据集上训练，学习估计聚类数量和分配的后验分布。

Result: 比AIC、BIC和变分推断更准确估计聚类数量，聚类质量与变分推断相当但速度快几个数量级；在缺失数据情况下优于基于插补的基线方法。

Conclusion: Cluster-PFN可提供可扩展且灵活的贝叶斯聚类解决方案。

Abstract: Bayesian clustering accounts for uncertainty but is computationally demanding
at scale. Furthermore, real-world datasets often contain missing values, and
simple imputation ignores the associated uncertainty, resulting in suboptimal
results. We present Cluster-PFN, a Transformer-based model that extends
Prior-Data Fitted Networks (PFNs) to unsupervised Bayesian clustering. Trained
entirely on synthetic datasets generated from a finite Gaussian Mixture Model
(GMM) prior, Cluster-PFN learns to estimate the posterior distribution over
both the number of clusters and the cluster assignments. Our method estimates
the number of clusters more accurately than handcrafted model selection
procedures such as AIC, BIC and Variational Inference (VI), and achieves
clustering quality competitive with VI while being orders of magnitude faster.
Cluster-PFN can be trained on complex priors that include missing data,
outperforming imputation-based baselines on real-world genomic datasets, at
high missingness. These results show that the Cluster-PFN can provide scalable
and flexible Bayesian clustering.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法将感知和决策耦合在一起训练，导致感知质量难以独立评估和优化。PeL旨在分离感知和决策，专注于提升感知接口的质量。

Method: 定义感知属性独立于目标任务和参数化，使用表示不变性指标评估感知质量，证明PeL更新与贝叶斯任务风险梯度正交。

Result: 提供了任务无关的评估指标来认证感知质量，确保感知接口具有稳定性、信息性和可控几何特性。

Conclusion: PeL为构建高质量感知系统提供了理论框架和实用工具，使感知优化独立于具体决策任务。

Abstract: We introduce Perception Learning (PeL), a paradigm that optimizes an agent's
sensory interface $f_\phi:\mathcal{X}\to\mathcal{Z}$ using task-agnostic
signals, decoupled from downstream decision learning
$g_\theta:\mathcal{Z}\to\mathcal{Y}$. PeL directly targets label-free
perceptual properties, such as stability to nuisances, informativeness without
collapse, and controlled geometry, assessed via objective
representation-invariant metrics. We formalize the separation of perception and
decision, define perceptual properties independent of objectives or
reparameterizations, and prove that PeL updates preserving sufficient
invariants are orthogonal to Bayes task-risk gradients. Additionally, we
provide a suite of task-agnostic evaluation metrics to certify perceptual
quality.

TL;DR: 提出一种两阶段数据驱动方法，通过实例硬度过滤和置信度拒绝机制提升医疗领域机器学习模型的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习模型在医疗等高风险领域应用时，往往无法有效处理不确定性，即使置信度低也会提供预测，这可能导致严重后果。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：训练阶段使用实例硬度过滤问题样本改善数据质量；推理阶段引入置信度拒绝机制，只保留可靠预测。

Result: 在三个真实医疗数据集上的评估表明，该方法能有效提升模型可靠性，同时平衡预测性能和拒绝率，保留大部分实例。

Conclusion: 该方法为在安全关键应用中部署机器学习系统提供了实用解决方案，实例硬度过滤与置信度拒绝的结合能有效提升性能。

Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) models are widely used in high-stakes domains such as
healthcare, where the reliability of predictions is critical. However, these
models often fail to account for uncertainty, providing predictions even with
low confidence. This work proposes a novel two-step data-centric approach to
enhance the performance of ML models by improving data quality and filtering
low-confidence predictions. The first step involves leveraging Instance
Hardness (IH) to filter problematic instances during training, thereby refining
the dataset. The second step introduces a confidence-based rejection mechanism
during inference, ensuring that only reliable predictions are retained. We
evaluate our approach using three real-world healthcare datasets, demonstrating
its effectiveness at improving model reliability while balancing predictive
performance and rejection rate. Additionally, we use alternative criteria -
influence values for filtering and uncertainty for rejection - as baselines to
evaluate the efficiency of the proposed method. The results demonstrate that
integrating IH filtering with confidence-based rejection effectively enhances
model performance while preserving a large proportion of instances. This
approach provides a practical method for deploying ML systems in
safety-critical applications.

*Yuanyuan Wu,Zhenlin Qin,Zhenliang Ma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个代表性-隐私-效用（RPU）框架，系统评估合成出行数据在三个维度和三个层次上的质量，发现合成数据不能固有保证隐私，CTGAN提供了最平衡的权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 合成数据解决了智能卡数据在公共交通研究中的隐私和可访问性挑战，但现有评估方法碎片化，缺乏对群体层面变化或任务特定效用的考虑。

Method: 提出了RPU框架，在三个维度（代表性、隐私、效用）和三个层次（记录、群体、总体）上系统评估合成出行数据，整合了一致的度量标准来量化相似性、披露风险和实践有用性。

Result: 对12种代表性生成方法进行基准测试，结果表明合成数据不能固有保证隐私，不存在"一刀切"模型，隐私与代表性/效用之间存在明显权衡，CTGAN提供了最平衡的权衡。

Conclusion: RPU框架为研究人员和从业者提供了系统、可重复的基础，用于比较合成数据生成技术并在公共交通应用中选择适当方法。

Abstract: Synthetic data offers a promising solution to the privacy and accessibility
challenges of using smart card data in public transport research. Despite rapid
progress in generative modeling, there is limited attention to comprehensive
evaluation, leaving unclear how reliable, safe, and useful synthetic data truly
are. Existing evaluations remain fragmented, typically limited to
population-level representativeness or record-level privacy, without
considering group-level variations or task-specific utility. To address this
gap, we propose a Representativeness-Privacy-Utility (RPU) framework that
systematically evaluates synthetic trip data across three complementary
dimensions and three hierarchical levels (record, group, population). The
framework integrates a consistent set of metrics to quantify similarity,
disclosure risk, and practical usefulness, enabling transparent and balanced
assessment of synthetic data quality. We apply the framework to benchmark
twelve representative generation methods, spanning conventional statistical
models, deep generative networks, and privacy-enhanced variants. Results show
that synthetic data do not inherently guarantee privacy and there is no
"one-size-fits-all" model, the trade-off between privacy and
representativeness/utility is obvious. Conditional Tabular generative
adversarial network (CTGAN) provide the most balanced trade-off and is
suggested for practical applications. The RPU framework provides a systematic
and reproducible basis for researchers and practitioners to compare synthetic
data generation techniques and select appropriate methods in public transport
applications.

TL;DR: 提出了APEX方法，用于在计算预算有限的情况下，对大规模组合合成库进行近似但全面的虚拟筛选。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有组合合成库规模庞大（数十亿化合物），但虚拟筛选通常只能评估不到0.1%的化合物，导致许多高分化合物未被发现。

Method: 使用神经网络代理模型，利用组合合成库的结构来预测目标和约束，在消费级GPU上实现全库枚举（不到1分钟），精确检索近似top-k集合。

Result: 在包含1000多万化合物的基准测试中，APEX在检索精度和运行时间方面均优于其他方法。

Conclusion: APEX能够在大规模组合合成库中高效准确地识别高分化合物，解决了传统虚拟筛选方法的局限性。

Abstract: Make-on-demand combinatorial synthesis libraries (CSLs) like Enamine REAL
have significantly enabled drug discovery efforts. However, their large size
presents a challenge for virtual screening, where the goal is to identify the
top compounds in a library according to a computational objective (e.g.,
optimizing docking score) subject to computational constraints under a limited
computational budget. For current library sizes -- numbering in the tens of
billions of compounds -- and scoring functions of interest, a routine virtual
screening campaign may be limited to scoring fewer than 0.1% of the available
compounds, leaving potentially many high scoring compounds undiscovered.
Furthermore, as constraints (and sometimes objectives) change during the course
of a virtual screening campaign, existing virtual screening algorithms
typically offer little room for amortization. We propose the
approximate-but-exhaustive search protocol for CSLs, or APEX. APEX utilizes a
neural network surrogate that exploits the structure of CSLs in the prediction
of objectives and constraints to make full enumeration on a consumer GPU
possible in under a minute, allowing for exact retrieval of approximate top-$k$
sets. To demonstrate APEX's capabilities, we develop a benchmark CSL comprised
of more than 10 million compounds, all of which have been annotated with their
docking scores on five medically relevant targets along with physicohemical
properties measured with RDKit such that, for any objective and set of
constraints, the ground truth top-$k$ compounds can be identified and compared
against the retrievals from any virtual screening algorithm. We show APEX's
consistently strong performance both in retrieval accuracy and runtime compared
to alternative methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏奖励环境中的强化学习面临缺乏信息反馈的挑战，需要大量探索才能获得有效学习信号。

Method: 使用少量成功演示预计算价值函数估计，将其作为早期学习目标，然后通过标准在线交互进行精炼，形成离线到在线的混合学习范式。

Result: 在基准任务上的实验表明，该方法加速了收敛速度，即使使用最少或次优的演示数据也能超越标准基线方法。

Conclusion: 通过演示初始化价值函数的方法有效减轻了探索负担，显著提高了稀疏奖励环境中的强化学习样本效率。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) in sparse-reward environments remains a
significant challenge due to the lack of informative feedback. We propose a
simple yet effective method that uses a small number of successful
demonstrations to initialize the value function of an RL agent. By precomputing
value estimates from offline demonstrations and using them as targets for early
learning, our approach provides the agent with a useful prior over promising
actions. The agent then refines these estimates through standard online
interaction. This hybrid offline-to-online paradigm significantly reduces the
exploration burden and improves sample efficiency in sparse-reward settings.
Experiments on benchmark tasks demonstrate that our method accelerates
convergence and outperforms standard baselines, even with minimal or suboptimal
demonstration data.

Survival Analysis (GBSA), Survival SVM (SSVM), XGBoost-Cox (XGB-Cox),
XGBoost-AFT (XGB-AFT), and LightGBM (LGBM), capable of predicting survival
considering censored data. Hyperparameter optimization was performed with
different samplers, and model performance was assessed using the Concordance

Abstract: Sepsis is a leading cause of mortality in intensive care units (ICUs), yet
existing research often relies on outdated datasets, non-reproducible
preprocessing pipelines, and limited coverage of clinical interventions. We
introduce MIMIC-Sepsis, a curated cohort and benchmark framework derived from
the MIMIC-IV database, designed to support reproducible modeling of sepsis
trajectories. Our cohort includes 35,239 ICU patients with time-aligned
clinical variables and standardized treatment data, including vasopressors,
fluids, mechanical ventilation and antibiotics. We describe a transparent
preprocessing pipeline-based on Sepsis-3 criteria, structured imputation
strategies, and treatment inclusion-and release it alongside benchmark tasks
focused on early mortality prediction, length-of-stay estimation, and shock
onset classification. Empirical results demonstrate that incorporating
treatment variables substantially improves model performance, particularly for
Transformer-based architectures. MIMIC-Sepsis serves as a robust platform for
evaluating predictive and sequential models in critical care research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LoRA初始化方法存在局限性：许多方法不使用目标域数据，而基于梯度的方法仅依赖单步梯度分解，性能有限且缺乏严格理论基础。

Method: 建立基于渐近分析的理论框架，推导包含偏置项和方差项的优化问题，通过Fisher-梯度公式保持各向异性，并开发LoRA-DA算法从少量目标域样本估计最优初始化。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，LoRA-DA相比现有初始化方法持续提升最终准确率，表现出更快、更稳定的收敛性，对秩变化具有鲁棒性，且初始化开销小。

Conclusion: LoRA-DA为数据感知的LoRA初始化提供了理论基础和有效算法，显著改善了微调性能，代码将在发表后开源。

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of LLMs, LoRA has become a dominant method for
PEFT, and its initialization methods have attracted increasing attention.
However, existing methods have notable limitations: many methods do not
incorporate target-domain data, while gradient-based methods exploit data only
at a shallow level by relying on one-step gradient decomposition, which remains
unsatisfactory due to the weak empirical performance of the one-step
fine-tuning model that serves as their basis, as well as the fact that these
methods either lack a rigorous theoretical foundation or depend heavily on
restrictive isotropic assumptions. In this paper, we establish a theoretical
framework for data-aware LoRA initialization based on asymptotic analysis.
Starting from a general optimization objective that minimizes the expectation
of the parameter discrepancy between the fine-tuned and target models, we
derive an optimization problem with two components: a bias term, which is
related to the parameter distance between the fine-tuned and target models, and
is approximated using a Fisher-gradient formulation to preserve anisotropy; and
a variance term, which accounts for the uncertainty introduced by sampling
stochasticity through the Fisher information. By solving this problem, we
obtain an optimal initialization strategy for LoRA. Building on this
theoretical framework, we develop an efficient algorithm, LoRA-DA, which
estimates the terms in the optimization problem from a small set of target
domain samples and obtains the optimal LoRA initialization. Empirical results
across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that LoRA-DA consistently improves final
accuracy over existing initialization methods. Additional studies show faster,
more stable convergence, robustness across ranks, and only a small
initialization overhead for LoRA-DA. The source code will be released upon
publication.

TL;DR: 提出了DistDF方法，通过最小化条件预测分布与标签分布之间的差异来训练时间序列预测模型，解决了传统直接预测方法在标签自相关情况下的偏差问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统直接预测方法在存在标签自相关时，条件负对数似然的估计存在偏差，需要找到更好的训练目标来对齐预测分布和标签分布。

Method: 引入联合分布Wasserstein差异度量，该度量可证明上界目标条件差异，并能从经验样本中进行可微分估计，与基于梯度的训练无缝集成。

Result: 大量实验表明DistDF提升了多种预测模型的性能，并达到了最先进的预测性能。

Conclusion: DistDF通过最小化条件分布差异有效解决了标签自相关带来的偏差问题，显著提升了时间序列预测模型的性能。

Abstract: Training time-series forecast models requires aligning the conditional
distribution of model forecasts with that of the label sequence. The standard
direct forecast (DF) approach resorts to minimize the conditional negative
log-likelihood of the label sequence, typically estimated using the mean
squared error. However, this estimation proves to be biased in the presence of
label autocorrelation. In this paper, we propose DistDF, which achieves
alignment by alternatively minimizing a discrepancy between the conditional
forecast and label distributions. Because conditional discrepancies are
difficult to estimate from finite time-series observations, we introduce a
newly proposed joint-distribution Wasserstein discrepancy for time-series
forecasting, which provably upper bounds the conditional discrepancy of
interest. This discrepancy admits tractable, differentiable estimation from
empirical samples and integrates seamlessly with gradient-based training.
Extensive experiments show that DistDF improves the performance diverse
forecast models and achieves the state-of-the-art forecasting performance. Code

Abstract: Current quantum machine learning approaches often face challenges balancing
predictive accuracy, robustness, and interpretability. To address this, we
propose a novel quantum adversarial framework that integrates a hybrid quantum
neural network (QNN) with classical deep learning layers, guided by an
evaluator model with LIME-based interpretability, and extended through quantum
GAN and self-supervised variants. In the proposed model, an adversarial
evaluator concurrently guides the QNN by computing feedback loss, thereby
optimizing both prediction accuracy and model explainability. Empirical
evaluations show that the Vanilla model achieves RMSE = 0.27, MSE = 0.071, MAE
= 0.21, and R^2 = 0.59, delivering the most consistent performance across
regression metrics compared to adversarial counterparts. These results
demonstrate the potential of combining quantum-inspired methods with classical
architectures to develop lightweight, high-performance, and interpretable
predictive models, advancing the applicability of QML beyond current
limitations.

Conclusion: 该框架成功解决了健康指标提取的挑战，DTC-VAE方法在性能一致性方面表现最佳，为复合材料结构健康监测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Health indicators (HIs) are central to diagnosing and prognosing the
condition of aerospace composite structures, enabling efficient maintenance and
operational safety. However, extracting reliable HIs remains challenging due to
variability in material properties, stochastic damage evolution, and diverse
damage modes. Manufacturing defects (e.g., disbonds) and in-service incidents
(e.g., bird strikes) further complicate this process. This study presents a
comprehensive data-driven framework that learns HIs via two learning approaches
integrated with multi-domain signal processing. Because ground-truth HIs are
unavailable, a semi-supervised and an unsupervised approach are proposed: (i) a
diversity deep semi-supervised anomaly detection (Diversity-DeepSAD) approach
augmented with continuous auxiliary labels used as hypothetical damage proxies,
which overcomes the limitation of prior binary labels that only distinguish
healthy and failed states while neglecting intermediate degradation, and (ii) a
degradation-trend-constrained variational autoencoder (DTC-VAE), in which the
monotonicity criterion is embedded via an explicit trend constraint. Guided
waves with multiple excitation frequencies are used to monitor single-stiffener
composite structures under fatigue loading. Time, frequency, and time-frequency
representations are explored, and per-frequency HIs are fused via unsupervised
ensemble learning to mitigate frequency dependence and reduce variance. Using
fast Fourier transform features, the augmented Diversity-DeepSAD model achieved
81.6% performance, while DTC-VAE delivered the most consistent HIs with 92.3%
performance, outperforming existing baselines.

Motivation: 时序数据中的因果发现面临组合复杂性挑战，传统基于排序的方法限制了模型表示能力，需要解决单一排序方法带来的伪影问题。

Method: 提出DOTS方法，在平稳性和加性噪声模型假设下，利用扩散过程和分数匹配进行高效Hessian估计，整合多个有效因果排序。

Conclusion: DOTS为时序因果发现提供了一个可扩展且准确的解决方案，通过多排序方法显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Predicting causal structure from time series data is crucial for
understanding complex phenomena in physiology, brain connectivity, climate
dynamics, and socio-economic behaviour. Causal discovery in time series is
hindered by the combinatorial complexity of identifying true causal
relationships, especially as the number of variables and time points grow. A
common approach to simplify the task is the so-called ordering-based methods.
Traditional ordering methods inherently limit the representational capacity of
the resulting model. In this work, we fix this issue by leveraging multiple
valid causal orderings, instead of a single one as standard practice. We
propose DOTS (Diffusion Ordered Temporal Structure), using diffusion-based
causal discovery for temporal data. By integrating multiple orderings, DOTS
effectively recovers the transitive closure of the underlying directed acyclic
graph, mitigating spurious artifacts inherent in single-ordering approaches. We
formalise the problem under standard assumptions such as stationarity and the
additive noise model, and leverage score matching with diffusion processes to
enable efficient Hessian estimation. Extensive experiments validate the
approach. Empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets
demonstrate that DOTS outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, offering a
scalable and robust approach to temporal causal discovery. On synthetic
benchmarks ($d{=}\!3-\!6$ variables, $T{=}200\!-\!5{,}000$ samples), DOTS
improves mean window-graph $F1$ from $0.63$ (best baseline) to $0.81$. On the
CausalTime real-world benchmark ($d{=}20\!-\!36$), while baselines remain the
best on individual datasets, DOTS attains the highest average summary-graph
$F1$ while halving runtime relative to graph-optimisation methods. These
results establish DOTS as a scalable and accurate solution for temporal causal
discovery.

Motivation: 研究ReLU网络在稳健记忆场景下的参数复杂度，填补现有工作在ρ∈(0,1)范围内精细分析的空白，理解稳健性要求对网络参数需求的影响。

Method: 通过理论分析建立参数复杂度的上下界，考虑不同ρ值下的稳健记忆需求，与现有非稳健记忆的参数复杂度进行比较。

Result: 发现当ρ较小时，稳健记忆的参数复杂度与非稳健记忆相同；随着ρ增大，参数复杂度也随之增长。获得了比现有结果更紧的上下界。

Conclusion: 稳健记忆的参数复杂度依赖于稳健比ρ，小ρ时与非稳健记忆相当，大ρ时需要更多参数来保证稳健性要求。

Abstract: We study the parameter complexity of robust memorization for $\mathrm{ReLU}$
networks: the number of parameters required to interpolate any given dataset
with $\epsilon$-separation between differently labeled points, while ensuring
predictions remain consistent within a $\mu$-ball around each training sample.
We establish upper and lower bounds on the parameter count as a function of the
robustness ratio $\rho = \mu / \epsilon$. Unlike prior work, we provide a
fine-grained analysis across the entire range $\rho \in (0,1)$ and obtain
tighter upper and lower bounds that improve upon existing results. Our findings
reveal that the parameter complexity of robust memorization matches that of
non-robust memorization when $\rho$ is small, but grows with increasing $\rho$.

Abstract: Accurately predicting the three-dimensional structures of protein-ligand
complexes remains a fundamental challenge in computational drug discovery that
limits the pace and success of therapeutic design. Deep learning methods have
recently shown strong potential as structural prediction tools, achieving
promising accuracy across diverse biomolecular systems. However, their
performance and utility are constrained by scarce experimental data,
inefficient architectures, physically invalid poses, and the limited ability to
exploit auxiliary information available at inference. To address these issues,
we introduce Pearl (Placing Every Atom in the Right Location), a foundation
model for protein-ligand cofolding at scale. Pearl addresses these challenges
with three key innovations: (1) training recipes that include large-scale
synthetic data to overcome data scarcity; (2) architectures that incorporate an
SO(3)-equivariant diffusion module to inherently respect 3D rotational
symmetries, improving generalization and sample efficiency, and (3)
controllable inference, including a generalized multi-chain templating system
supporting both protein and non-polymeric components as well as dual
unconditional/conditional modes. Pearl establishes a new state-of-the-art
performance in protein-ligand cofolding. On the key metric of generating
accurate (RMSD < 2 \r{A}) and physically valid poses, Pearl surpasses AlphaFold
3 and other open source baselines on the public Runs N' Poses and PoseBusters
benchmarks, delivering 14.5% and 14.2% improvements, respectively, over the
next best model. In the pocket-conditional cofolding regime, Pearl delivers
$3.6\times$ improvement on a proprietary set of challenging, real-world drug
targets at the more rigorous RMSD < 1 \r{A} threshold. Finally, we demonstrate
that model performance correlates directly with synthetic dataset size used in
training.

Conclusion: 该框架能够提取有序可识别的特征函数，为特征选择和表示学习提供了更精确的谱分解工具。

Abstract: Recent advances in representation learning reveal that widely used
objectives, such as contrastive and non-contrastive, implicitly perform
spectral decomposition of a contextual kernel, induced by the relationship
between inputs and their contexts. Yet, these methods recover only the linear
span of top eigenfunctions of the kernel, whereas exact spectral decomposition
is essential for understanding feature ordering and importance. In this work,
we propose a general framework to extract ordered and identifiable
eigenfunctions, based on modular building blocks designed to satisfy key
desiderata, including compatibility with the contextual kernel and scalability
to modern settings. We then show how two main methodological paradigms,
low-rank approximation and Rayleigh quotient optimization, align with this
framework for eigenfunction extraction. Finally, we validate our approach on
synthetic kernels and demonstrate on real-world image datasets that the
recovered eigenvalues act as effective importance scores for feature selection,
enabling principled efficiency-accuracy tradeoffs via adaptive-dimensional
representations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出将选项框架应用于高速公路自动驾驶任务，通过定义纵向和横向操作的专用选项，结合安全舒适约束，提高了学习效率和驾驶行为的可控性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然深度强化学习在自动驾驶中有广泛应用，但很少使用选项框架。该框架天然适合分层控制应用，特别是自动驾驶任务，因此本文将其应用于高速公路场景。

Method: 定义纵向和横向操作的专用选项，嵌入安全和舒适约束；提出几种分层控制设置，基于最先进强化学习技术开发实用算法；通过分别选择纵向和横向控制动作，实现组合和混合选项策略。

Result: 在所有研究方法中，基于混合选项的灵活策略在不同交通条件下表现最佳，优于基于动作的基线策略。这些策略具有与人类驾驶员相同的表达能力和灵活性，且比基于连续动作的经典策略更易解释。

Conclusion: 选项框架成功应用于高速公路自动驾驶，通过分层控制提高了学习效率和驾驶行为的可控性，混合选项策略在不同交通条件下表现最优。

Abstract: Out of the many deep reinforcement learning approaches for autonomous
driving, only few make use of the options (or skills) framework. That is
surprising, as this framework is naturally suited for hierarchical control
applications in general, and autonomous driving tasks in specific. Therefore,
in this work the options framework is applied and tailored to autonomous
driving tasks on highways. More specifically, we define dedicated options for
longitudinal and lateral manoeuvres with embedded safety and comfort
constraints. This way, prior domain knowledge can be incorporated into the
learning process and the learned driving behaviour can be constrained more
easily. We propose several setups for hierarchical control with options and
derive practical algorithms following state-of-the-art reinforcement learning
techniques. By separately selecting actions for longitudinal and lateral
control, the introduced policies over combined and hybrid options obtain the
same expressiveness and flexibility that human drivers have, while being easier
to interpret than classical policies over continuous actions. Of all the
investigated approaches, these flexible policies over hybrid options perform
the best under varying traffic conditions, outperforming the baseline policies
over actions.

*Di Wu,Chengshuai Shi,Jing Yang,Cong Shen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了在一般偏好模型下RLHF的理论分析，证明了贪心采样算法的性能保证，相比现有方法有显著改进，并揭示了KL正则化目标下最优策略类的独特结构特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管RLHF在实践中取得了成功，但其理论理解仍然有限。现有研究主要关注基于奖励的Bradley-Terry偏好模型，而本文考虑更一般的偏好模型，旨在获得比现有方法更好的性能保证。

Method: 使用贪心采样算法，直接使用经验估计而非构建乐观或悲观估计，利用KL正则化目标下最优策略类的独特结构特性。

Result: 在一般偏好模型下获得了比现有方法有显著改进的性能保证，并在BT模型中进一步验证了贪心采样的充分性。

Conclusion: 揭示了在RLHF中贪心采样算法的理论有效性，这源于KL正则化目标下最优策略类的独特结构特性，为RLHF的理论理解提供了新视角。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a key
technique for post-training large language models. Despite its empirical
success, the theoretical understanding of RLHF is still limited, as learning
the KL-regularized target with only preference feedback poses additional
challenges compared with canonical RL. Existing works mostly study the
reward-based Bradley-Terry (BT) preference model, and extend classical designs
utilizing optimism or pessimism. This work, instead, considers the general
preference model (whose practical relevance has been observed recently) and
obtains performance guarantees with major, order-wise improvements over
existing ones. Surprisingly, these results are derived from algorithms that
directly use the empirical estimates (i.e., greedy sampling), as opposed to
constructing optimistic or pessimistic estimates in previous works. This
insight has a deep root in the unique structural property of the optimal policy
class under the KL-regularized target, and we further specialize it to the BT
model, highlighting the surprising sufficiency of greedy sampling in RLHF.

Conclusion: MSRANetV2是一个可靠、可解释且高性能的结直肠组织分类模型，通过Grad-CAM可视化增强了模型可解释性。

Abstract: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a leading worldwide cause of cancer-related
mortality, and the role of prompt precise detection is of paramount interest in
improving patient outcomes. Conventional diagnostic methods such as colonoscopy
and histological examination routinely exhibit subjectivity, are extremely
time-consuming, and are susceptible to variation. Through the development of
digital pathology, deep learning algorithms have become a powerful approach in
enhancing diagnostic precision and efficiency. In our work, we proposed a
convolutional neural network architecture named MSRANetV2, specially optimized
for the classification of colorectal tissue images. The model employs a
ResNet50V2 backbone, extended with residual attention mechanisms and
squeeze-and-excitation (SE) blocks, to extract deep semantic and fine-grained
spatial features. With channel alignment and upsampling operations, MSRANetV2
effectively fuses multi-scale representations, thereby enhancing the robustness
of the classification. We evaluated our model on a five-fold stratified
cross-validation strategy on two publicly available datasets: CRC-VAL-HE-7K and
NCT-CRC-HE-100K. The proposed model achieved remarkable average Precision,
recall, F1-score, AUC, and test accuracy were 0.9884 plus-minus 0.0151, 0.9900
plus-minus 0.0151, 0.9900 plus-minus 0.0145, 0.9999 plus-minus 0.00006, and
0.9905 plus-minus 0.0025 on the 7K dataset. On the 100K dataset, they were
0.9904 plus-minus 0.0091, 0.9900 plus-minus 0.0071, 0.9900 plus-minus 0.0071,
0.9997 plus-minus 0.00016, and 0.9902 plus-minus 0.0006. Additionally, Grad-CAM
visualizations were incorporated to enhance model interpretability by
highlighting tissue areas that are medically relevant. These findings validate
that MSRANetV2 is a reliable, interpretable, and high-performing architectural
model for classifying CRC tissues.
