### [1] [GAZE:Governance-Aware pre-annotation for Zero-shot World Model Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14992)
*Leela Krishna,Mengyang Zhao,Saicharithreddy Pasula,Harshit Rajgarhia,Abhishek Mukherji*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GAZE是一个自动化流水线，可将原始长视频转换为高质量的世界模型训练数据，通过AI模型进行多模态预标注，显著提升标注效率和隐私保护。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 训练鲁棒的世界模型需要大规模精确标注的多模态数据集，但传统手动标注过程缓慢且昂贵，需要自动化解决方案来突破这一瓶颈。

Method: 采用三步流程：(1)标准化360度视频格式并分片处理；(2)应用AI模型套件进行场景理解、目标跟踪、音频转录等密集多模态预标注；(3)整合信号为结构化输出规范供人工快速验证。

Result: 工作流显著提升效率（每审核小时节省约19分钟），通过保守自动跳过低显著性片段减少人工审核量80%以上，生成高保真、隐私感知的数据集。

Conclusion: GAZE提供了一个可扩展的蓝图，可在不牺牲吞吐量或治理的前提下生成高质量世界模型训练数据，有效支持跨模态动态和动作条件预测的学习。

Abstract: Training robust world models requires large-scale, precisely labeled
multimodal datasets, a process historically bottlenecked by slow and expensive
manual annotation. We present a production-tested GAZE pipeline that automates
the conversion of raw, long-form video into rich, task-ready supervision for
world-model training. Our system (i) normalizes proprietary 360-degree formats
into standard views and shards them for parallel processing; (ii) applies a
suite of AI models (scene understanding, object tracking, audio transcription,
PII/NSFW/minor detection) for dense, multimodal pre-annotation; and (iii)
consolidates signals into a structured output specification for rapid human
validation.
  The GAZE workflow demonstrably yields efficiency gains (~19 minutes saved per
review hour) and reduces human review volume by >80% through conservative
auto-skipping of low-salience segments. By increasing label density and
consistency while integrating privacy safeguards and chain-of-custody metadata,
our method generates high-fidelity, privacy-aware datasets directly consumable
for learning cross-modal dynamics and action-conditioned prediction. We detail
our orchestration, model choices, and data dictionary to provide a scalable
blueprint for generating high-quality world model training data without
sacrificing throughput or governance.

### [2] [PC-UNet: An Enforcing Poisson Statistics U-Net for Positron Emission Tomography Denoising](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14995)
*Yang Shi,Jingchao Wang,Liangsi Lu,Mingxuan Huang,Ruixin He,Yifeng Xie,Hanqian Liu,Minzhe Guo,Yangyang Liang,Weipeng Zhang,Zimeng Li,Xuhang Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出PC-UNet模型和PVMC-Loss损失函数，用于解决PET成像中低剂量导致的泊松噪声问题，通过整合物理数据提高图像保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PET成像在临床应用中受限于高剂量辐射暴露，降低剂量会增加泊松噪声，现有去噪方法无法有效处理这种噪声，导致图像失真和伪影。

Method: 开发了Poisson Consistent U-Net (PC-UNet)模型，引入新的Poisson Variance and Mean Consistency Loss (PVMC-Loss)，该损失函数整合物理数据，在方差和梯度适应方面具有统计无偏性，可作为广义矩方法的实现。

Result: 在PET数据集上的测试表明，PC-UNet提高了物理一致性和图像保真度，证明了其有效整合物理信息的能力。

Conclusion: PC-UNet模型通过PVMC-Loss成功解决了PET低剂量成像中的泊松噪声问题，为临床提供了一种更安全有效的图像重建方法。

Abstract: Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is crucial in medicine, but its clinical
use is limited due to high signal-to-noise ratio doses increasing radiation
exposure. Lowering doses increases Poisson noise, which current denoising
methods fail to handle, causing distortions and artifacts. We propose a Poisson
Consistent U-Net (PC-UNet) model with a new Poisson Variance and Mean
Consistency Loss (PVMC-Loss) that incorporates physical data to improve image
fidelity. PVMC-Loss is statistically unbiased in variance and gradient
adaptation, acting as a Generalized Method of Moments implementation, offering
robustness to minor data mismatches. Tests on PET datasets show PC-UNet
improves physical consistency and image fidelity, proving its ability to
integrate physical information effectively.

### [3] [DeLeaker: Dynamic Inference-Time Reweighting For Semantic Leakage Mitigation in Text-to-Image Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15015)
*Mor Ventura,Michael Toker,Or Patashnik,Yonatan Belinkov,Roi Reichart*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeLeaker是一种轻量级、无需优化的推理时方法，通过直接干预模型注意力图来缓解文本到图像模型中的语义泄漏问题，无需外部输入即可有效抑制实体间过度交互。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本到图像模型存在语义泄漏问题，即不同实体间语义相关特征的意外传递。现有缓解策略通常基于优化或依赖外部输入，需要更轻量高效的解决方案。

Method: 在扩散过程中动态重新加权注意力图，抑制过度的跨实体交互，同时强化每个实体的身份特征。

Result: DeLeaker在所有基线方法中表现最佳，即使基线方法使用外部信息，DeLeaker也能在不影响保真度或质量的情况下有效缓解泄漏。

Conclusion: 注意力控制具有重要价值，为开发更语义精确的文本到图像模型铺平了道路。

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) models have advanced rapidly, yet they remain vulnerable
to semantic leakage, the unintended transfer of semantically related features
between distinct entities. Existing mitigation strategies are often
optimization-based or dependent on external inputs. We introduce DeLeaker, a
lightweight, optimization-free inference-time approach that mitigates leakage
by directly intervening on the model's attention maps. Throughout the diffusion
process, DeLeaker dynamically reweights attention maps to suppress excessive
cross-entity interactions while strengthening the identity of each entity. To
support systematic evaluation, we introduce SLIM (Semantic Leakage in IMages),
the first dataset dedicated to semantic leakage, comprising 1,130
human-verified samples spanning diverse scenarios, together with a novel
automatic evaluation framework. Experiments demonstrate that DeLeaker
consistently outperforms all baselines, even when they are provided with
external information, achieving effective leakage mitigation without
compromising fidelity or quality. These results underscore the value of
attention control and pave the way for more semantically precise T2I models.

### [4] [UrbanVerse: Scaling Urban Simulation by Watching City-Tour Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15018)
*Mingxuan Liu,Honglin He,Elisa Ricci,Wayne Wu,Bolei Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UrbanVerse是一个数据驱动的真实到仿真系统，将众包城市游览视频转换为物理感知的交互式仿真场景，用于训练城市AI代理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的人工制作或程序生成的仿真场景缺乏可扩展性或无法捕捉真实世界的复杂性，无法满足城市AI代理训练的需求。

Method: UrbanVerse包含UrbanVerse-100K（10万+带标注的城市3D资产库）和UrbanVerse-Gen（从视频提取场景布局并实例化3D仿真的自动流水线）。

Result: 系统提供160个高质量场景，保持真实世界语义和布局，在仿真中成功率提高6.3%，零样本仿真到真实转移成功率提高30.1%。

Conclusion: UrbanVerse能够有效训练城市AI代理，在真实世界任务中表现出色，仅需两次干预即可完成300米任务。

Abstract: Urban embodied AI agents, ranging from delivery robots to quadrupeds, are
increasingly populating our cities, navigating chaotic streets to provide
last-mile connectivity. Training such agents requires diverse, high-fidelity
urban environments to scale, yet existing human-crafted or procedurally
generated simulation scenes either lack scalability or fail to capture
real-world complexity. We introduce UrbanVerse, a data-driven real-to-sim
system that converts crowd-sourced city-tour videos into physics-aware,
interactive simulation scenes. UrbanVerse consists of: (i) UrbanVerse-100K, a
repository of 100k+ annotated urban 3D assets with semantic and physical
attributes, and (ii) UrbanVerse-Gen, an automatic pipeline that extracts scene
layouts from video and instantiates metric-scale 3D simulations using retrieved
assets. Running in IsaacSim, UrbanVerse offers 160 high-quality constructed
scenes from 24 countries, along with a curated benchmark of 10 artist-designed
test scenes. Experiments show that UrbanVerse scenes preserve real-world
semantics and layouts, achieving human-evaluated realism comparable to manually
crafted scenes. In urban navigation, policies trained in UrbanVerse exhibit
scaling power laws and strong generalization, improving success by +6.3% in
simulation and +30.1% in zero-shot sim-to-real transfer comparing to prior
methods, accomplishing a 300 m real-world mission with only two interventions.

### [5] [NANO3D: A Training-Free Approach for Efficient 3D Editing Without Masks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15019)
*Junliang Ye,Shenghao Xie,Ruowen Zhao,Zhengyi Wang,Hongyu Yan,Wenqiang Zu,Lei Ma,Jun Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Nano3D是一个无需训练的3D物体编辑框架，通过FlowEdit和TRELLIS集成实现局部编辑，并引入Voxel/Slat-Merge合并策略来保持结构一致性，同时构建了首个大规模3D编辑数据集Nano3D-Edit-100k。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前3D物体编辑方法效率低下、不一致，且难以保持未编辑区域，多视图渲染后重建会引入伪影，限制了实际应用。

Method: 将FlowEdit集成到TRELLIS中，通过前视图渲染引导局部编辑，并引入区域感知合并策略Voxel/Slat-Merge，自适应保持结构保真度。

Result: 实验表明Nano3D在3D一致性和视觉质量方面优于现有方法，并构建了包含10万+高质量3D编辑对的大规模数据集。

Conclusion: 该工作解决了算法设计和数据可用性的长期挑战，显著提高了3D编辑的通用性和可靠性，为前馈3D编辑模型的发展奠定了基础。

Abstract: 3D object editing is essential for interactive content creation in gaming,
animation, and robotics, yet current approaches remain inefficient,
inconsistent, and often fail to preserve unedited regions. Most methods rely on
editing multi-view renderings followed by reconstruction, which introduces
artifacts and limits practicality. To address these challenges, we propose
Nano3D, a training-free framework for precise and coherent 3D object editing
without masks. Nano3D integrates FlowEdit into TRELLIS to perform localized
edits guided by front-view renderings, and further introduces region-aware
merging strategies, Voxel/Slat-Merge, which adaptively preserve structural
fidelity by ensuring consistency between edited and unedited areas. Experiments
demonstrate that Nano3D achieves superior 3D consistency and visual quality
compared with existing methods. Based on this framework, we construct the first
large-scale 3D editing datasets Nano3D-Edit-100k, which contains over 100,000
high-quality 3D editing pairs. This work addresses long-standing challenges in
both algorithm design and data availability, significantly improving the
generality and reliability of 3D editing, and laying the groundwork for the
development of feed-forward 3D editing models. Project

*Jiaxin Ge,Grace Luo,Heekyung Lee,Nishant Malpani,Long Lian,XuDong Wang,Aleksander Holynski,Trevor Darrell,Sewon Min,David M. Chan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了ECHO框架，通过社交媒体真实使用数据构建图像生成模型基准测试，发现现有基准未能覆盖的新兴用例，并能更好地区分最先进模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像生成基准测试滞后于技术进步，无法捕捉新兴使用场景，导致社区认知与正式评估之间存在差距。

Method: 从社交媒体帖子中收集展示新颖提示和用户定性判断的真实使用证据，构建包含31,000多个提示的数据集。

Result: ECHO发现了现有基准中缺失的创意复杂任务，能更好地区分最先进模型，并通过社区反馈为模型质量指标设计提供信息。

Conclusion: 基于真实世界证据的基准构建方法能更准确地反映模型在实际使用中的表现和新兴能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in image generation, often driven by proprietary systems like
GPT-4o Image Gen, regularly introduce new capabilities that reshape how users
interact with these models. Existing benchmarks often lag behind and fail to
capture these emerging use cases, leaving a gap between community perceptions
of progress and formal evaluation. To address this, we present ECHO, a
framework for constructing benchmarks directly from real-world evidence of
model use: social media posts that showcase novel prompts and qualitative user
judgments. Applying this framework to GPT-4o Image Gen, we construct a dataset
of over 31,000 prompts curated from such posts. Our analysis shows that ECHO
(1) discovers creative and complex tasks absent from existing benchmarks, such
as re-rendering product labels across languages or generating receipts with
specified totals, (2) more clearly distinguishes state-of-the-art models from
alternatives, and (3) surfaces community feedback that we use to inform the
design of metrics for model quality (e.g., measuring observed shifts in color,
identity, and structure). Our website is at https://echo-bench.github.io.

### [7] [LoRAverse: A Submodular Framework to Retrieve Diverse Adapters for Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15022)
*Mert Sonmezer,Matthew Zheng,Pinar Yanardag*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种基于子模框架的方法，用于从海量LoRA适配器数据库中高效选择和组合最相关且多样化的模型，解决用户选择困难问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA模型虽然能个性化预训练扩散模型，但平台上超过10万个适配器缺乏结构化组织，用户难以导航、选择和有效使用最合适的适配器。

Method: 将LoRA模型选择任务构建为组合优化问题，提出新颖的子模框架来解决从庞大数据库中筛选最相关和多样化模型的问题。

Result: 定量和定性实验表明，该方法能在广泛领域内生成多样化的输出结果。

Conclusion: 所提出的子模框架有效解决了LoRA适配器选择和组合的挑战，为用户提供了更好的模型选择方案。

Abstract: Low-rank Adaptation (LoRA) models have revolutionized the personalization of
pre-trained diffusion models by enabling fine-tuning through low-rank,
factorized weight matrices specifically optimized for attention layers. These
models facilitate the generation of highly customized content across a variety
of objects, individuals, and artistic styles without the need for extensive
retraining. Despite the availability of over 100K LoRA adapters on platforms
like Civit.ai, users often face challenges in navigating, selecting, and
effectively utilizing the most suitable adapters due to their sheer volume,
diversity, and lack of structured organization. This paper addresses the
problem of selecting the most relevant and diverse LoRA models from this vast
database by framing the task as a combinatorial optimization problem and
proposing a novel submodular framework. Our quantitative and qualitative
experiments demonstrate that our method generates diverse outputs across a wide
range of domains.

### [8] [MOBIUS: Big-to-Mobile Universal Instance Segmentation via Multi-modal Bottleneck Fusion and Calibrated Decoder Pruning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15026)
*Mattia Segu,Marta Tintore Gazulla,Yongqin Xian,Luc Van Gool,Federico Tombari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MOBIUS是一个用于通用实例分割的基础模型家族，通过瓶颈像素解码器、语言引导不确定性校准损失和统一训练策略，在减少55%像素FLOPs和75%变换器解码器FLOPs的同时保持最先进性能，支持从高端加速器到移动硬件的帕累托最优部署。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基础模型在实例级感知方面虽然性能优异，但计算成本过高，限制了在资源受限平台上的部署。需要开发既能保持高性能又能高效部署的模型架构。

Method: 提出瓶颈像素解码器用于高效多尺度和多模态融合；语言引导不确定性校准损失用于自适应解码器剪枝；统一的训练策略简化训练流程。

Result: MOBIUS将像素和变换器解码器FLOPs分别减少55%和75%，仅需三分之一的训练迭代次数就能保持最先进的性能表现。

Conclusion: MOBIUS为高性能计算平台和移动设备上的高效分割建立了新的基准，实现了性能与效率的帕累托最优平衡。

Abstract: Scaling up model size and training data has advanced foundation models for
instance-level perception, achieving state-of-the-art in-domain and zero-shot
performance across object detection and segmentation. However, their high
computational cost limits adoption on resource-constrained platforms. We first
examine the limitations of existing architectures in enabling efficient edge
deployment without compromising performance. We then introduce MOBIUS, a family
of foundation models for universal instance segmentation, designed for
Pareto-optimal downscaling to support deployment across devices ranging from
high-end accelerators to mobile hardware. To reduce training and inference
demands, we propose: (i) a bottleneck pixel decoder for efficient multi-scale
and multi-modal fusion, (ii) a language-guided uncertainty calibration loss for
adaptive decoder pruning, and (iii) a streamlined, unified training strategy.
Unlike efficient baselines that trade accuracy for reduced complexity, MOBIUS
reduces pixel and transformer decoder FLOPs by up to 55% and 75%, respectively,
while maintaining state-of-the-art performance in just a third of the training
iterations. MOBIUS establishes a new benchmark for efficient segmentation on
both high-performance computing platforms and mobile devices.

TL;DR: COGS框架通过分解种子问题为基本感知和推理因子，然后系统重组生成大量合成问答对，有效提升多模态大语言模型在图表等人工图像领域的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在缺乏大规模人工标注推理数据的领域（如图表、文档、网页等人工图像领域）推理能力有限，需要数据高效的方法来增强推理能力。

Method: 将每个种子问题分解为原始感知和推理因子，然后系统性地与新图像重组，生成大量合成问答对，每个问题都配有子问题和中间答案，支持基于因子级过程奖励的强化学习。

Result: 在图表推理任务上，COGS显著提高了对未见问题的性能，在推理密集和组合性问题上的提升最大。使用不同种子数据的因子级混合训练在多个数据集上实现了更好的迁移效果。

Conclusion: COGS框架能够诱导出可泛化的能力而非数据集特定的过拟合，并且可扩展到图表之外的其他领域如网页。

Abstract: Pretrained multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) demonstrate strong
performance on diverse multimodal tasks, but remain limited in reasoning
capabilities for domains where annotations are difficult to collect. In this
work, we focus on artificial image domains such as charts, rendered documents,
and webpages, which are abundant in practice yet lack large-scale human
annotated reasoning datasets. We introduce COGS (COmposition-Grounded
instruction Synthesis), a data-efficient framework for equipping MLLMs with
advanced reasoning abilities from a small set of seed questions. The key idea
is to decompose each seed question into primitive perception and reasoning
factors, which can then be systematically recomposed with new images to
generate large collections of synthetic question-answer pairs. Each generated
question is paired with subquestions and intermediate answers, enabling
reinforcement learning with factor-level process rewards. Experiments on chart
reasoning show that COGS substantially improves performance on unseen
questions, with the largest gains on reasoning-heavy and compositional
questions. Moreover, training with a factor-level mixture of different seed
data yields better transfer across multiple datasets, suggesting that COGS
induces generalizable capabilities rather than dataset-specific overfitting. We
further demonstrate that the framework extends beyond charts to other domains
such as webpages.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GDGen是一个从势能角度统一刚体、铰接体和软体动力学的框架，通过引入方向刚度来捕捉广泛的物理行为，为创建交互式虚拟环境和训练机器人代理提供通用基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数字孪生世界为开发通用具身智能体提供了新机会，但需要统一处理复杂物理行为的框架。

Method: 从势能角度出发，将世界视为整体实体，通过引入方向刚度扩展经典弹性动力学，使用专门网络建模材料属性，神经场表示变形。

Result: 实验表明GDGen能稳健统一多种仿真范式，为复杂动态场景提供通用基础。

Conclusion: GDGen提供了一个统一、几何无关的系统，能够无缝集成多种物理动力学，为交互式虚拟环境和机器人训练提供多功能基础。

Abstract: Digital twin worlds with realistic interactive dynamics presents a new
opportunity to develop generalist embodied agents in scannable environments
with complex physical behaviors. To this end, we present GDGen (Generalized
Representation for Generalized Dynamics Generation), a framework that takes a
potential energy perspective to seamlessly integrate rigid body, articulated
body, and soft body dynamics into a unified, geometry-agnostic system. GDGen
operates from the governing principle that the potential energy for any stable
physical system should be low. This fresh perspective allows us to treat the
world as one holistic entity and infer underlying physical properties from
simple motion observations. We extend classic elastodynamics by introducing
directional stiffness to capture a broad spectrum of physical behaviors,
covering soft elastic, articulated, and rigid body systems. We propose a
specialized network to model the extended material property and employ a neural
field to represent deformation in a geometry-agnostic manner. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that GDGen robustly unifies diverse simulation
paradigms, offering a versatile foundation for creating interactive virtual
environments and training robotic agents in complex, dynamically rich
scenarios.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了COLIPRI编码器家族，通过引入报告生成目标和结合视觉-语言预训练与纯视觉预训练来解决3D医学影像领域数据不足的问题，在多个任务上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决3D医学影像领域视觉-语言预训练因数据可用性有限而能力受限的问题，通过注入额外归纳偏置来缓解数据缺乏。

Method: 引入报告生成目标，将视觉-语言预训练与纯视觉预训练相结合，利用图像-文本配对数据集和纯图像数据集，结合3D医学影像领域的最佳实践开发COLIPRI编码器。

Result: COLIPRI编码器在报告生成、分类探针和零样本分类任务上达到最先进性能，在语义分割任务上保持竞争力。

Conclusion: 通过额外的归纳偏置和结合不同类型的数据集，可以有效提升3D医学影像视觉-语言编码器的性能，缓解数据不足的限制。

Abstract: Vision-language pre-training, i.e., aligning images with paired text, is a
powerful paradigm to create encoders that can be directly used for tasks such
as classification and retrieval, and for downstream tasks such as segmentation
and report generation. In the 3D medical image domain, these capabilities allow
vision-language encoders (VLEs) to support radiologists by retrieving patients
with similar abnormalities or predicting likelihoods of abnormality. While the
methodology holds promise, data availability limits the capabilities of current
3D VLEs.
  In this paper, we alleviate the lack of data by injecting additional
inductive biases: introducing a report generation objective and pairing
vision-language pre-training with vision-only pre-training. This allows us to
leverage both image-only and paired image-text 3D datasets, increasing the
total amount of data to which our model is exposed. Through these additional
inductive biases, paired with best practices of the 3D medical imaging domain,
we develop the Comprehensive Language-image Pre-training (COLIPRI) encoder
family. Our COLIPRI encoders achieve state-of-the-art performance in report
generation, classification probing, and zero-shot classification, and remain
competitive for semantic segmentation.

TL;DR: DRIFT是一种轻量级方法，通过在梯度空间中转移推理知识来提升多模态大语言模型的推理能力，避免破坏多模态对齐，比传统方法更高效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型的推理能力通常落后于纯文本模型，现有方法依赖资源密集的监督微调或强化学习，模型合并方法效果不稳定且因模型而异。

Method: 提出DRIFT方法：预计算推理先验作为推理变体与多模态变体在参数空间的差异，在多模态微调期间使用该先验来偏置梯度，实现推理知识转移。

Result: 在多模态推理基准测试（如MathVista和MathVerse）上，DRIFT相比朴素合并和监督微调持续提升推理性能，以较低成本达到或超越训练密集型方法的效果。

Conclusion: DRIFT提供了一种高效且稳定的方法，能够在保持多模态对齐的同时提升多模态大语言模型的推理能力，为资源受限的场景提供可行解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are rapidly advancing, yet their
reasoning ability often lags behind that of strong text-only counterparts.
Existing methods to bridge this gap rely on supervised fine-tuning over
large-scale multimodal reasoning data or reinforcement learning, both of which
are resource-intensive. A promising alternative is model merging, which
interpolates parameters between reasoning-enhanced LLMs and multimodal
variants. However, our analysis shows that naive merging is not always a "free
lunch": its effectiveness varies drastically across model families, with some
(e.g., LLaVA, Idefics) benefiting while others (e.g., Qwen) suffer performance
degradation. To address this, we propose Directional Reasoning Injection for
Fine-Tuning (DRIFT) MLLMs, a lightweight method that transfers reasoning
knowledge in the gradient space, without destabilizing multimodal alignment.
DRIFT precomputes a reasoning prior as the parameter-space difference between
reasoning and multimodal variants, then uses it to bias gradients during
multimodal fine-tuning. This approach preserves the simplicity of standard
supervised fine-tuning pipelines while enabling efficient reasoning transfer.
Extensive experiments on multimodal reasoning benchmarks, including MathVista
and MathVerse, demonstrate that DRIFT consistently improves reasoning
performance over naive merging and supervised fine-tuning, while matching or
surpassing training-heavy methods at a fraction of the cost.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Young children readily recognize and generalize visual objects labeled by
common nouns, suggesting that these basic level object categories may be given.
Yet if they are, how they arise remains unclear. We propose that the answer
lies in the statistics of infant daily life visual experiences. Whereas large
and diverse datasets typically support robust learning and generalization in
human and machine learning, infants achieve this generalization from limited
experiences. We suggest that the resolution of this apparent contradiction lies
in the visual diversity of daily life, repeated experiences with single object
instances. Analyzing egocentric images from 14 infants (aged 7 to 11 months) we
show that their everyday visual input exhibits a lumpy similarity structure,
with clusters of highly similar images interspersed with rarer, more variable
ones, across eight early-learned categories. Computational experiments show
that mimicking this structure in machines improves generalization from small
datasets in machine learning. The natural lumpiness of infant experience may
thus support early category learning and generalization and, more broadly,
offer principles for efficient learning across a variety of problems and kinds
of learners.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SaLon3R是一个结构感知的长期3D高斯溅射重建框架，通过引入紧凑锚点基元和3D点变换器，有效消除冗余并解决跨帧几何和光度不一致问题，实现了超过50视图、10FPS的在线通用化重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3DGS方法在长时视频序列中预测逐像素高斯并将所有视图的高斯组合作为场景表示，导致大量冗余和几何不一致。

Method: 首先使用3D重建骨干网络预测密集逐像素高斯和编码区域几何复杂度的显著性图，通过优先考虑高复杂度区域将冗余高斯压缩为紧凑锚点；然后使用3D点变换器学习空间结构先验来精炼锚点属性和显著性，实现区域自适应高斯解码。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，该方法在新型视图合成和深度估计方面达到最先进性能，实现了50%到90%的冗余消除，具有优越的效率、鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: SaLon3R是首个能够在无需已知相机参数或测试时优化的情况下，通过单次前向传播有效解决伪影并修剪冗余3DGS的在线通用化高斯溅射方法。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have enabled generalizable,
on-the-fly reconstruction of sequential input views. However, existing methods
often predict per-pixel Gaussians and combine Gaussians from all views as the
scene representation, leading to substantial redundancies and geometric
inconsistencies in long-duration video sequences. To address this, we propose
SaLon3R, a novel framework for Structure-aware, Long-term 3DGS Reconstruction.
To our best knowledge, SaLon3R is the first online generalizable GS method
capable of reconstructing over 50 views in over 10 FPS, with 50% to 90%
redundancy removal. Our method introduces compact anchor primitives to
eliminate redundancy through differentiable saliency-aware Gaussian
quantization, coupled with a 3D Point Transformer that refines anchor
attributes and saliency to resolve cross-frame geometric and photometric
inconsistencies. Specifically, we first leverage a 3D reconstruction backbone
to predict dense per-pixel Gaussians and a saliency map encoding regional
geometric complexity. Redundant Gaussians are compressed into compact anchors
by prioritizing high-complexity regions. The 3D Point Transformer then learns
spatial structural priors in 3D space from training data to refine anchor
attributes and saliency, enabling regionally adaptive Gaussian decoding for
geometric fidelity. Without known camera parameters or test-time optimization,
our approach effectively resolves artifacts and prunes the redundant 3DGS in a
single feed-forward pass. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate our
state-of-the-art performance on both novel view synthesis and depth estimation,
demonstrating superior efficiency, robustness, and generalization ability for
long-term generalizable 3D reconstruction. Project Page:

TL;DR: TGT框架通过文本引导的轨迹控制视频生成，使用位置感知交叉注意力和双CFG方案，实现了对多对象场景中外观和运动的精确控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到视频生成方法在复杂场景和多对象设置下控制能力有限，缺乏轨迹与视觉实体之间的清晰对应关系。

Method: 提出文本引导轨迹框架，使用位置感知交叉注意力整合轨迹和局部文本描述，采用双CFG方案分别调制局部和全局文本指导。

Result: TGT在视觉质量、文本对齐精度和运动可控性方面优于现有方法，能够精确控制多个对象的运动轨迹。

Conclusion: TGT框架通过轨迹与文本的配对，为视频生成提供了直观的运动控制手柄，在多对象场景中表现出色。

Abstract: Text-to-video generation has advanced rapidly in visual fidelity, whereas
standard methods still have limited ability to control the subject composition
of generated scenes. Prior work shows that adding localized text control
signals, such as bounding boxes or segmentation masks, can help. However, these
methods struggle in complex scenarios and degrade in multi-object settings,
offering limited precision and lacking a clear correspondence between
individual trajectories and visual entities as the number of controllable
objects increases. We introduce Text-Grounded Trajectories (TGT), a framework
that conditions video generation on trajectories paired with localized text
descriptions. We propose Location-Aware Cross-Attention (LACA) to integrate
these signals and adopt a dual-CFG scheme to separately modulate local and
global text guidance. In addition, we develop a data processing pipeline that
produces trajectories with localized descriptions of tracked entities, and we
annotate two million high quality video clips to train TGT. Together, these
components enable TGT to use point trajectories as intuitive motion handles,
pairing each trajectory with text to control both appearance and motion.
Extensive experiments show that TGT achieves higher visual quality, more
accurate text alignment, and improved motion controllability compared with
prior approaches. Website: https://textgroundedtraj.github.io.

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently emerged as powerful generative models in
medical imaging. However, it remains a major challenge to combine these
data-driven models with domain knowledge to guide brain imaging problems. In
neuroimaging, Bayesian inverse problems have long provided a successful
framework for inference tasks, where incorporating domain knowledge of the
imaging process enables robust performance without requiring extensive training
data. However, the anatomical modeling component of these approaches typically
relies on classical mathematical priors that often fail to capture the complex
structure of brain anatomy. In this work, we present the first general-purpose
application of diffusion models as priors for solving a wide range of medical
imaging inverse problems. Our approach leverages a score-based diffusion prior
trained extensively on diverse brain MRI data, paired with flexible forward
models that capture common image processing tasks such as super-resolution,
bias field correction, inpainting, and combinations thereof. We further
demonstrate how our framework can refine outputs from existing deep learning
methods to improve anatomical fidelity. Experiments on heterogeneous clinical
and research MRI data show that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance producing consistent, high-quality solutions without requiring
paired training datasets. These results highlight the potential of diffusion
priors as versatile tools for brain MRI analysis.

TL;DR: FFT-MIL通过将傅里叶变换引入多示例学习，在频率域提取全局上下文特征，与空间补丁特征融合，显著提升了全切片图像分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于多示例学习的全切片图像分类方法难以捕捉全局依赖关系，因为WSI尺寸巨大且补丁嵌入具有局部性，这限制了建模粗粒度结构的能力。

Method: 提出FFT-MIL框架，使用快速傅里叶变换从WSI中提取低频裁剪，通过包含卷积层和Min-Max归一化的FFT模块处理，然后将学习到的全局频率特征与空间补丁特征融合。

Result: 在三个公共数据集上评估六个最先进的MIL方法，集成FFT模块后宏F1分数平均提升3.51%，AUC提升1.51%，在不同架构和数据集上均表现一致提升。

Conclusion: 频率域学习是捕捉WSI分类中全局依赖关系的有效且高效机制，补充了空间特征，推进了基于MIL的计算病理学的可扩展性和准确性。

Abstract: Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification relies on Multiple Instance Learning
(MIL) with spatial patch features, yet existing methods struggle to capture
global dependencies due to the immense size of WSIs and the local nature of
patch embeddings. This limitation hinders the modeling of coarse structures
essential for robust diagnostic prediction.
  We propose Fourier Transform Multiple Instance Learning (FFT-MIL), a
framework that augments MIL with a frequency-domain branch to provide compact
global context. Low-frequency crops are extracted from WSIs via the Fast
Fourier Transform and processed through a modular FFT-Block composed of
convolutional layers and Min-Max normalization to mitigate the high variance of
frequency data. The learned global frequency feature is fused with spatial
patch features through lightweight integration strategies, enabling
compatibility with diverse MIL architectures.
  FFT-MIL was evaluated across six state-of-the-art MIL methods on three public
datasets (BRACS, LUAD, and IMP). Integration of the FFT-Block improved macro F1
scores by an average of 3.51% and AUC by 1.51%, demonstrating consistent gains
across architectures and datasets. These results establish frequency-domain
learning as an effective and efficient mechanism for capturing global
dependencies in WSI classification, complementing spatial features and
advancing the scalability and accuracy of MIL-based computational pathology.

TL;DR: 提出了XModBench基准，用于评估全模态大语言模型在跨模态一致性方面的表现，发现现有模型在空间和时间推理方面存在困难，存在模态差异和方向不平衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要评估通用跨模态问答能力，但不清楚全模态大语言模型是否真正实现了模态不变推理或存在模态特定偏差。

Method: 构建了包含60,828个多项选择题的大规模三模态基准XModBench，涵盖五个任务家族和所有六种模态组合，能够对模型的模态不变推理、模态差异和方向不平衡进行细粒度诊断。

Result: 实验显示，即使是性能最强的Gemini 2.5 Pro模型也存在三个主要问题：(i) 空间和时间推理能力不足，准确率低于60%；(ii) 存在持续模态差异，当相同语义内容通过音频而非文本传达时性能显著下降；(iii) 显示系统性方向不平衡，当视觉作为上下文时一致性低于文本。

Conclusion: 当前全模态大语言模型距离真正的模态不变推理还很远，XModBench可作为评估和改进跨模态能力的基本诊断工具。

Abstract: Omni-modal large language models (OLLMs) aim to unify audio, vision, and text
understanding within a single framework. While existing benchmarks primarily
evaluate general cross-modal question-answering ability, it remains unclear
whether OLLMs achieve modality-invariant reasoning or exhibit modality-specific
biases. We introduce XModBench, a large-scale tri-modal benchmark explicitly
designed to measure cross-modal consistency. XModBench comprises 60,828
multiple-choice questions spanning five task families and systematically covers
all six modality compositions in question-answer pairs, enabling fine-grained
diagnosis of an OLLM's modality-invariant reasoning, modality disparity, and
directional imbalance. Experiments show that even the strongest model, Gemini
2.5 Pro, (i) struggles with spatial and temporal reasoning, achieving less than
60% accuracy, (ii) reveals persistent modality disparities, with performance
dropping substantially when the same semantic content is conveyed through audio
rather than text, and (iii) shows systematic directional imbalance, exhibiting
lower consistency when vision serves as context compared to text. These
findings indicate that current OLLMs remain far from truly modality-invariant
reasoning and position XModBench as a fundamental diagnostic tool for
evaluating and improving cross-modal competence. All data and evaluation tools
will be available at https://xingruiwang.github.io/projects/XModBench/.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在图像-文本描述数据和交错文档数据上进行持续预训练，但对图像-文本交错文档数据的高质量数据筛选研究不足。

Method: 采用半合成方法，利用原始图像生成对应四个质量级别的文本，创建样本-分数对来训练UniFilter分类器，用于筛选DataComp描述数据集和OBELICS交错数据集中的高质量数据。

Result: 在筛选数据上预训练的MLLMs展现出显著增强的零样本推理和上下文学习能力，经过视觉监督微调后在多个基准测试中表现更优。

Conclusion: UniFilter能有效筛选高质量多模态数据，提升MLLMs性能，作者发布了合成训练数据、模型检查点和高质量OBELICS-HQ子集供社区使用。

Abstract: The Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are continually pre-trained on a
mixture of image-text caption data and interleaved document data, while the
high-quality data filtering towards image-text interleaved document data is
under-explored. We propose to train an efficient MLLM as a Unified Mulitmodal
Data Quality Classifier to Filter both high-quality image-text caption and
interleaved data (UniFilter). To address the challenge of collecting diverse
labeled multimodal data, we introduce a semi-synthetic approach that leverages
readily available raw images and generates corresponding text across four
quality levels. This method enables efficient creation of sample-score pairs
for both caption and interleaved document data to train UniFilter. We apply
UniFilter to curate high-quality caption data from DataComp caption dataset and
interleaved data from the OBELICS image-text interleaved dataset. MLLMs
pre-trained on the filtered data demonstrate significantly enhanced
capabilities compared to those trained on baseline-filtered data, achieving
stronger zero-shot reasoning and in-context learning capabilities. After visual
supervised fine-tuning, these UniFilter-induced MLLMs achieve stronger
performance on various benchmarks, highlighting the downstream benefits of
high-quality multimodal pre-training. We release the synthetic training data
used for training UniFilter, the UniFilter model checkpoints, and the
high-quality interleaved document subset OBELICS-HQ, curated by UniFilter, to
the community for reproduction and further development.

Motivation: 解决组织病理学基础模型训练中的可重复性挑战，包括软件随机性、硬件非确定性和超参数报告不一致等问题。

Method: 在QUILT-1M数据集上训练CLIP模型，系统评估不同超参数设置（如RandomResizedCrop值、学习率）和增强策略在三个下游组织病理学数据集上的影响。

Result: 发现RandomResizedCrop值0.7-0.8表现最佳，分布式训练无局部损失提高了稳定性，学习率低于5.0e-5会降低性能，LC25000（结肠）数据集提供了最可重复的基准。

Conclusion: 计算病理学的可重复性不仅依赖于透明文档，还需要精心选择的实验配置，研究提供了开发可重复数字病理学基础模型的实用规则。

Abstract: Reproducibility remains a critical challenge in foundation model training for
histopathology, often hindered by software randomness, hardware
non-determinism, and inconsistent hyperparameter reporting. To investigate
these issues, we trained a CLIP model on the QUILT-1M dataset and
systematically evaluated the impact of different hyperparameter settings and
augmentation strategies across three downstream histopathology datasets
(PatchCamelyon, LC25000-Lung, and LC25000-Colon). Despite variability across
runs, we identified clear trends: RandomResizedCrop values of 0.7-0.8
outperformed more aggressive (0.6) or conservative (0.9) settings, distributed
training without local loss improved stability, and learning rates below 5.0e-5
consistently degraded performance across all datasets. The LC25000 (Colon)
dataset consistently provided the most reproducible benchmark. These findings
highlight that reproducibility in computational pathology depends not only on
transparent documentation but also on carefully chosen experimental
configurations, and we provide practical rules to guide future efforts in
developing reproducible foundation models for digital pathology.

Motivation: 现有基于图像和文本提示的生成数据增强方法难以平衡保真度和多样性，因为合成过程中的表示往往与非必要的输入图像属性（如环境上下文）纠缠，与修改这些元素的文本提示产生冲突。

Method: 使用显著概念感知图像嵌入模型来减少合成过程中不相关视觉细节的影响，保持图像和文本输入之间的直观对齐，通过生成更好保留类别区分特征并带有额外受控变化的图像来增强训练数据多样性。

Result: 在八个细粒度视觉数据集上表现出色，在常规和长尾设置下分别以0.73%和6.5%的平均分类准确率提升优于最先进的增强方法。

Conclusion: 该框架通过减少不相关视觉细节的影响，有效平衡了生成图像的保真度和多样性，显著提升了下游模型的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Recent generative data augmentation methods conditioned on both image and
text prompts struggle to balance between fidelity and diversity, as it is
challenging to preserve essential image details while aligning with varied text
prompts. This challenge arises because representations in the synthesis process
often become entangled with non-essential input image attributes such as
environmental contexts, creating conflicts with text prompts intended to modify
these elements. To address this, we propose a personalized image generation
framework that uses a salient concept-aware image embedding model to reduce the
influence of irrelevant visual details during the synthesis process, thereby
maintaining intuitive alignment between image and text inputs. By generating
images that better preserve class-discriminative features with additional
controlled variations, our framework effectively enhances the diversity of
training datasets and thereby improves the robustness of downstream models. Our
approach demonstrates superior performance across eight fine-grained vision
datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art augmentation methods with averaged
classification accuracy improvements by 0.73% and 6.5% under conventional and
long-tail settings, respectively.

Motivation: 先天性心脏病（CHDs）的产前诊断对AI解决方案具有巨大潜力，但由于这些疾病的罕见性导致数据收集困难，存在不平衡和低质量数据集的问题，且目前没有公开的多源信息整合数据集，限制了AI模型支持临床决策的能力。

Method: 提出CARDIUM数据集，整合胎儿超声和超声心动图图像以及母体临床记录；设计了一个多模态transformer架构，采用交叉注意力机制融合图像和表格数据的特征表示。

Result: 提出的多模态方法在CARDIUM数据集上相比单模态方法，CHD检测性能分别提升了11%（图像）和50%（表格数据），F1分数达到79.8±4.8%。

Conclusion: CARDIUM数据集和提出的多模态transformer架构为产前CHD检测提供了有价值的资源和方法，将公开数据集和代码以促进该领域进一步研究。

Abstract: Prenatal diagnosis of Congenital Heart Diseases (CHDs) holds great potential
for Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven solutions. However, collecting
high-quality diagnostic data remains difficult due to the rarity of these
conditions, resulting in imbalanced and low-quality datasets that hinder model
performance. Moreover, no public efforts have been made to integrate multiple
sources of information, such as imaging and clinical data, further limiting the
ability of AI models to support and enhance clinical decision-making. To
overcome these challenges, we introduce the Congenital Anomaly Recognition with
Diagnostic Images and Unified Medical records (CARDIUM) dataset, the first
publicly available multimodal dataset consolidating fetal ultrasound and
echocardiographic images along with maternal clinical records for prenatal CHD
detection. Furthermore, we propose a robust multimodal transformer architecture
that incorporates a cross-attention mechanism to fuse feature representations
from image and tabular data, improving CHD detection by 11% and 50% over image
and tabular single-modality approaches, respectively, and achieving an F1 score
of 79.8 $\pm$ 4.8% in the CARDIUM dataset. We will publicly release our dataset

Result: 能够实时生成长达12FPS的扩展驾驶视频（424×800分辨率）和相应的动态3D场景，在新视角合成上达到SSIM 0.811和PSNR 22.84，同时保持参数效率。

Conclusion: DriveGen3D成功实现了高质量、可控的动态3D驾驶场景生成，在计算效率和生成质量方面取得了显著进展。

Abstract: We present DriveGen3D, a novel framework for generating high-quality and
highly controllable dynamic 3D driving scenes that addresses critical
limitations in existing methodologies. Current approaches to driving scene
synthesis either suffer from prohibitive computational demands for extended
temporal generation, focus exclusively on prolonged video synthesis without 3D
representation, or restrict themselves to static single-scene reconstruction.
Our work bridges this methodological gap by integrating accelerated long-term
video generation with large-scale dynamic scene reconstruction through
multimodal conditional control. DriveGen3D introduces a unified pipeline
consisting of two specialized components: FastDrive-DiT, an efficient video
diffusion transformer for high-resolution, temporally coherent video synthesis
under text and Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) layout guidance; and FastRecon3D, a
feed-forward reconstruction module that rapidly builds 3D Gaussian
representations across time, ensuring spatial-temporal consistency. Together,
these components enable real-time generation of extended driving videos (up to
$424\times800$ at 12 FPS) and corresponding dynamic 3D scenes, achieving SSIM
of 0.811 and PSNR of 22.84 on novel view synthesis, all while maintaining
parameter efficiency.

Abstract: While pre-trained visual representations have significantly advanced
imitation learning, they are often task-agnostic as they remain frozen during
policy learning. In this work, we explore leveraging pre-trained text-to-image
diffusion models to obtain task-adaptive visual representations for robotic
control, without fine-tuning the model itself. However, we find that naively
applying textual conditions - a successful strategy in other vision domains -
yields minimal or even negative gains in control tasks. We attribute this to
the domain gap between the diffusion model's training data and robotic control
environments, leading us to argue for conditions that consider the specific,
dynamic visual information required for control. To this end, we propose ORCA,
which introduces learnable task prompts that adapt to the control environment
and visual prompts that capture fine-grained, frame-specific details. Through
facilitating task-adaptive representations with our newly devised conditions,
our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on various robotic control
benchmarks, significantly surpassing prior methods.

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is the primary imaging modality used in the
diagnosis, assessment, and treatment planning for brain pathologies. However,
most automated MRI analysis tools, such as segmentation and registration
pipelines, are optimized for healthy anatomies and often fail when confronted
with large lesions such as tumors. To overcome this, image inpainting
techniques aim to locally synthesize healthy brain tissues in tumor regions,
enabling the reliable application of general-purpose tools. In this work, we
systematically evaluate state-of-the-art inpainting models and observe a
saturation in their standalone performance. In response, we introduce a
methodology combining model ensembling with efficient post-processing
strategies such as median filtering, histogram matching, and pixel averaging.
Further anatomical refinement is achieved via a lightweight U-Net enhancement
stage. Comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that our proposed pipeline
improves the anatomical plausibility and visual fidelity of inpainted regions,
yielding higher accuracy and more robust outcomes than individual baseline
models. By combining established models with targeted post-processing, we

TL;DR: 提出QCFace方法，通过硬边界策略解决人脸识别中可识别性与身份特征纠缠的问题，实现更好的特征表示和性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前人脸识别系统在可识别性表示方面存在两个主要问题：软边界约束只能部分捕捉可识别性，导致低质量人脸识别性能较差；特征方向和幅度的梯度重叠导致优化不稳定和表示纠缠。

Method: 引入硬边界策略QCFace，使用基于硬边界的损失函数，通过指导因子进行超球面规划，同时优化识别能力和明确的可识别性表示。

Result: 大量实验证实QCFace不仅提供鲁棒且可量化的可识别性编码，在验证和识别基准测试中相比现有基于可识别性的损失函数达到了最先进性能。

Conclusion: QCFace方法成功解决了可识别性与身份表示的纠缠问题，实现了更好的特征解耦和性能提升。

Abstract: Recognizability, a key perceptual factor in human face processing, strongly
affects the performance of face recognition (FR) systems in both verification
and identification tasks. Effectively using recognizability to enhance feature
representation remains challenging. In deep FR, the loss function plays a
crucial role in shaping how features are embedded. However, current methods
have two main drawbacks: (i) recognizability is only partially captured through
soft margin constraints, resulting in weaker quality representation and lower
discrimination, especially for low-quality or ambiguous faces; (ii) mutual
overlapping gradients between feature direction and magnitude introduce
undesirable interactions during optimization, causing instability and confusion
in hypersphere planning, which may result in poor generalization, and entangled
representations where recognizability and identity are not cleanly separated.
To address these issues, we introduce a hard margin strategy - Quality Control
Face (QCFace), which overcomes the mutual overlapping gradient problem and
enables the clear decoupling of recognizability from identity representation.
Based on this strategy, a novel hard-margin-based loss function employs a
guidance factor for hypersphere planning, simultaneously optimizing for
recognition ability and explicit recognizability representation. Extensive
experiments confirm that QCFace not only provides robust and quantifiable
recognizability encoding but also achieves state-of-the-art performance in both
verification and identification benchmarks compared to existing
recognizability-based losses.

TL;DR: 提出了首个用于单正多标签学习的双曲分类框架，将标签表示为双曲球而非点或向量，通过几何球体交互建模丰富的标签关系


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通过基于距离的相似性隐式建模标签关系，缺乏对不同关系类型的明确几何定义，难以捕捉复杂标签关系和层次结构

Method: 使用双曲球表示标签，通过球体交互自然建模包含关系（层次结构）、重叠关系（共现模式）和分离关系（语义独立性），并引入温度自适应双曲球分类器和物理启发的双井正则化

Result: 在四个基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，与现有方法相比具有竞争力且具有更优的可解释性，统计分析显示学习到的嵌入与实际共现模式强相关

Conclusion: 双曲几何为不完全监督下的结构化分类提供了更鲁棒的范式

Abstract: Single Positive Multi-Label Learning (SPMLL) addresses the challenging
scenario where each training sample is annotated with only one positive label
despite potentially belonging to multiple categories, making it difficult to
capture complex label relationships and hierarchical structures. While existing
methods implicitly model label relationships through distance-based similarity,
lacking explicit geometric definitions for different relationship types. To
address these limitations, we propose the first hyperbolic classification
framework for SPMLL that represents each label as a hyperbolic ball rather than
a point or vector, enabling rich inter-label relationship modeling through
geometric ball interactions. Our ball-based approach naturally captures
multiple relationship types simultaneously: inclusion for hierarchical
structures, overlap for co-occurrence patterns, and separation for semantic
independence. Further, we introduce two key component innovations: a
temperature-adaptive hyperbolic ball classifier and a physics-inspired
double-well regularization that guides balls toward meaningful configurations.
To validate our approach, extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets
(MS-COCO, PASCAL VOC, NUS-WIDE, CUB-200-2011) demonstrate competitive
performance with superior interpretability compared to existing methods.
Furthermore, statistical analysis reveals strong correlation between learned
embeddings and real-world co-occurrence patterns, establishing hyperbolic
geometry as a more robust paradigm for structured classification under
incomplete supervision.

TL;DR: SVG是一种新型的潜在扩散模型，不使用变分自编码器，而是利用自监督表示进行视觉生成。它通过冻结的DINO特征构建具有清晰语义可分性的特征空间，同时通过轻量级残差分支捕捉细粒度细节，实现更高效的扩散训练和更好的生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的VAE+扩散范式存在训练效率低、推理速度慢、对其他视觉任务迁移性差的问题，这些问题源于VAE潜在空间缺乏清晰的语义分离和强判别结构。

Method: SVG利用冻结的DINO特征构建语义结构化的潜在空间，同时使用轻量级残差分支捕捉细节信息，直接在语义结构化的潜在空间上训练扩散模型。

Result: SVG实现了加速的扩散训练，支持少步采样，提高了生成质量，同时保留了底层自监督表示的语义和判别能力。

Conclusion: SVG为面向任务通用、高质量视觉表示提供了原则性途径，解决了传统VAE+扩散范式的局限性。

Abstract: Recent progress in diffusion-based visual generation has largely relied on
latent diffusion models with variational autoencoders (VAEs). While effective
for high-fidelity synthesis, this VAE+diffusion paradigm suffers from limited
training efficiency, slow inference, and poor transferability to broader vision
tasks. These issues stem from a key limitation of VAE latent spaces: the lack
of clear semantic separation and strong discriminative structure. Our analysis
confirms that these properties are crucial not only for perception and
understanding tasks, but also for the stable and efficient training of latent
diffusion models. Motivated by this insight, we introduce SVG, a novel latent
diffusion model without variational autoencoders, which leverages
self-supervised representations for visual generation. SVG constructs a feature
space with clear semantic discriminability by leveraging frozen DINO features,
while a lightweight residual branch captures fine-grained details for
high-fidelity reconstruction. Diffusion models are trained directly on this
semantically structured latent space to facilitate more efficient learning. As
a result, SVG enables accelerated diffusion training, supports few-step
sampling, and improves generative quality. Experimental results further show
that SVG preserves the semantic and discriminative capabilities of the
underlying self-supervised representations, providing a principled pathway
toward task-general, high-quality visual representations.

TL;DR: CoMe是一个渐进式层剪枝框架，通过基于拼接的层合并技术和分层蒸馏后训练过程，有效减少大语言模型的参数规模，同时保持模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型虽然性能优异，但巨大的模型规模导致高计算和存储需求。现有结构化剪枝方法往往忽视保留剪枝部分的模型能力，存在性能下降、权重聚合不理想和缺乏有效后训练恢复机制等问题。

Method: 提出CoMe框架：1) 使用基于激活强度和权重范数的通道敏感度指标进行细粒度通道选择；2) 采用基于拼接的层合并方法融合相邻层的关键通道；3) 设计分层蒸馏协议，利用原始模型和剪枝模型层间对应关系进行知识迁移。

Result: 在7个基准测试上，CoMe达到最先进性能。当剪枝LLaMA-2-7b模型30%参数时，剪枝模型能保持原始模型83%的平均准确率。

Conclusion: CoMe通过渐进式剪枝和分层蒸馏，有效解决了大语言模型剪枝中的性能保持问题，在显著减少模型规模的同时保持了良好的性能表现。

Abstract: Large Language Models excel at natural language processing tasks, but their
massive size leads to high computational and storage demands. Recent works have
sought to reduce their model size through layer-wise structured pruning.
However, they tend to ignore retaining the capabilities in the pruned part. In
this work, we re-examine structured pruning paradigms and uncover several key
limitations: 1) notable performance degradation due to direct layer removal, 2)
incompetent linear weight layer aggregation, and 3) the lack of effective
post-training recovery mechanisms. To address these limitations, we propose
CoMe, including a progressive layer pruning framework with a
Concatenation-based Merging technology and a hierarchical distillation
post-training process. Specifically, we introduce a channel sensitivity metric
that utilizes activation intensity and weight norms for fine-grained channel
selection. Subsequently, we employ a concatenation-based layer merging method
to fuse the most critical channels across adjacent layers, enabling progressive
model size reduction. Finally, we propose a hierarchical distillation protocol
that leverages the correspondences between the original and pruned model layers
established during pruning, thereby enabling efficient knowledge transfer.
Experiments on seven benchmarks show that CoMe achieves state-of-the-art
performance; when pruning 30% of LLaMA-2-7b's parameters, the pruned model
retains 83% of its original average accuracy. Our code is available at

Motivation: 现有面部关键点检测数据集定义不同数量的关键点，主流方法只能在单一数据集上训练，限制了模型泛化能力和统一模型的发展。

Method: 提出Proto-Former框架，包含自适应原型感知编码器(APAE)进行特征提取和原型学习，渐进式原型感知解码器(PPAD)细化原型生成提示，以及原型感知(PA)损失函数解决多数据集训练中的原型专家寻址不稳定问题。

Conclusion: Proto-Former通过原型学习和多数据集联合训练，成功解决了面部关键点检测中的数据集差异问题，实现了统一的、高性能的检测框架。

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have significantly improved facial landmark
detection. However, existing facial landmark detection datasets often define
different numbers of landmarks, and most mainstream methods can only be trained
on a single dataset. This limits the model generalization to different datasets
and hinders the development of a unified model. To address this issue, we
propose Proto-Former, a unified, adaptive, end-to-end facial landmark detection
framework that explicitly enhances dataset-specific facial structural
representations (i.e., prototype). Proto-Former overcomes the limitations of
single-dataset training by enabling joint training across multiple datasets
within a unified architecture. Specifically, Proto-Former comprises two key
components: an Adaptive Prototype-Aware Encoder (APAE) that performs adaptive
feature extraction and learns prototype representations, and a Progressive
Prototype-Aware Decoder (PPAD) that refines these prototypes to generate
prompts that guide the model's attention to key facial regions. Furthermore, we
introduce a novel Prototype-Aware (PA) loss, which achieves optimal path
finding by constraining the selection weights of prototype experts. This loss
function effectively resolves the problem of prototype expert addressing
instability during multi-dataset training, alleviates gradient conflicts, and
enables the extraction of more accurate facial structure features. Extensive
experiments on widely used benchmark datasets demonstrate that our Proto-Former
achieves superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前人体运动重建方法在准确将人体放置在3D空间中存在困难，而逼真的人物与环境交互对于游戏、AR/VR和机器人等领域的自主代理至关重要。

Method: SHARE首先估计每帧的人体网格和分割掩码，以及关键帧的场景点图。通过迭代比较人体网格与使用掩码从场景提取的人体点图，优化关键帧中的人体位置，并保持非关键帧人体网格相对于关键帧根关节位置的一致性。

Result: 广泛实验表明，SHARE在准确重建周围场景的同时实现了更精确的3D人体定位，在策划数据集和野外网络视频上都表现出色。

Conclusion: SHARE方法优于现有技术，能够更准确地重建人体运动并定位在3D空间中。

Abstract: Animating realistic character interactions with the surrounding environment
is important for autonomous agents in gaming, AR/VR, and robotics. However,
current methods for human motion reconstruction struggle with accurately
placing humans in 3D space. We introduce Scene-Human Aligned REconstruction
(SHARE), a technique that leverages the scene geometry's inherent spatial cues
to accurately ground human motion reconstruction. Each reconstruction relies
solely on a monocular RGB video from a stationary camera. SHARE first estimates
a human mesh and segmentation mask for every frame, alongside a scene point map
at keyframes. It iteratively refines the human's positions at these keyframes
by comparing the human mesh against the human point map extracted from the
scene using the mask. Crucially, we also ensure that non-keyframe human meshes
remain consistent by preserving their relative root joint positions to keyframe
root joints during optimization. Our approach enables more accurate 3D human
placement while reconstructing the surrounding scene, facilitating use cases on
both curated datasets and in-the-wild web videos. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that SHARE outperforms existing methods.

Motivation: EEG和ECoG信号在运动想象分类中具有重要应用价值，但易受生理伪影干扰。现有Transformer方法难以捕捉信号的细粒度依赖关系。

Method: 提出Cortical-SSM架构，扩展深度状态空间模型，整合捕捉EEG和ECoG信号在时域、空域和频域的综合依赖关系。

Result: 在三个基准测试中（两个大规模公共MI EEG数据集和一个临床MI ECoG数据集）均优于基线方法，并能有效捕捉神经生理相关区域。

Conclusion: Cortical-SSM能够有效处理EEG和ECoG信号，在运动想象分类任务中表现出色，并提供了神经生理学上合理的可视化解释。

Abstract: Classification of electroencephalogram (EEG) and electrocorticogram (ECoG)
signals obtained during motor imagery (MI) has substantial application
potential, including for communication assistance and rehabilitation support
for patients with motor impairments. These signals remain inherently
susceptible to physiological artifacts (e.g., eye blinking, swallowing), which
pose persistent challenges. Although Transformer-based approaches for
classifying EEG and ECoG signals have been widely adopted, they often struggle
to capture fine-grained dependencies within them. To overcome these
limitations, we propose Cortical-SSM, a novel architecture that extends deep
state space models to capture integrated dependencies of EEG and ECoG signals
across temporal, spatial, and frequency domains. We validated our method across
three benchmarks: 1) two large-scale public MI EEG datasets containing more
than 50 subjects, and 2) a clinical MI ECoG dataset recorded from a patient
with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Our method outperformed baseline methods on
the three benchmarks. Furthermore, visual explanations derived from our model
indicate that it effectively captures neurophysiologically relevant regions of
both EEG and ECoG signals.

Motivation: 微创手术中的自动化手术工具检测具有重要意义，但手术场景中标注数据有限，这给训练鲁棒的深度学习模型带来了挑战。

Method: 采用两阶段自适应微调方法：线性探测阶段在预训练CNN架构上调节额外分类层，渐进冻结阶段动态减少可微调层数，以控制对手术领域的适应。

Result: 在Cholec80数据集上验证，使用ResNet-50和DenseNet-121架构，相比现有方法和标准微调技术，检测性能得到提升，mAP达到96.4%。在CATARACTS数据集上进一步验证了方法的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 渐进冻结微调是提高不同手术程序中工具存在检测性能的有前景技术，在通用图像分类任务中可能具有更广泛的应用。

Abstract: Minimally invasive surgery can benefit significantly from automated surgical
tool detection, enabling advanced analysis and assistance. However, the limited
availability of annotated data in surgical settings poses a challenge for
training robust deep learning models. This paper introduces a novel staged
adaptive fine-tuning approach consisting of two steps: a linear probing stage
to condition additional classification layers on a pre-trained CNN-based
architecture and a gradual freezing stage to dynamically reduce the
fine-tunable layers, aiming to regulate adaptation to the surgical domain. This
strategy reduces network complexity and improves efficiency, requiring only a
single training loop and eliminating the need for multiple iterations. We
validated our method on the Cholec80 dataset, employing CNN architectures
(ResNet-50 and DenseNet-121) pre-trained on ImageNet for detecting surgical
tools in cholecystectomy endoscopic videos. Our results demonstrate that our
method improves detection performance compared to existing approaches and
established fine-tuning techniques, achieving a mean average precision (mAP) of
96.4%. To assess its broader applicability, the generalizability of the
fine-tuning strategy was further confirmed on the CATARACTS dataset, a distinct
domain of minimally invasive ophthalmic surgery. These findings suggest that
gradual freezing fine-tuning is a promising technique for improving tool
presence detection in diverse surgical procedures and may have broader
applications in general image classification tasks.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖深度预测来恢复空间信息，需要LiDAR点云监督，但预测深度质量不佳，存在物体边界深度不连续和小物体难以区分的问题，且忽视了跨视图一致性和尺度不变性。

Method: 使用频率感知空间金字塔编码器(FSPE)结合高低频特征，跨视图尺度不变深度预测器(CSDP)估计像素级深度分布，位置深度编码器(PDE)生成3D深度感知特征，并采用混合深度监督从度量和分布两方面学习。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上的大量实验证明了方法的有效性和优越性。

Conclusion: 提出的FreqPDE方法能够有效解决多视图3D目标检测中的深度预测质量问题，无需LiDAR监督即可获得准确的3D检测结果。

Abstract: Detecting 3D objects accurately from multi-view 2D images is a challenging
yet essential task in the field of autonomous driving. Current methods resort
to integrating depth prediction to recover the spatial information for object
query decoding, which necessitates explicit supervision from LiDAR points
during the training phase. However, the predicted depth quality is still
unsatisfactory such as depth discontinuity of object boundaries and
indistinction of small objects, which are mainly caused by the sparse
supervision of projected points and the use of high-level image features for
depth prediction. Besides, cross-view consistency and scale invariance are also
overlooked in previous methods. In this paper, we introduce Frequency-aware
Positional Depth Embedding (FreqPDE) to equip 2D image features with spatial
information for 3D detection transformer decoder, which can be obtained through
three main modules. Specifically, the Frequency-aware Spatial Pyramid Encoder
(FSPE) constructs a feature pyramid by combining high-frequency edge clues and
low-frequency semantics from different levels respectively. Then the Cross-view
Scale-invariant Depth Predictor (CSDP) estimates the pixel-level depth
distribution with cross-view and efficient channel attention mechanism.
Finally, the Positional Depth Encoder (PDE) combines the 2D image features and
3D position embeddings to generate the 3D depth-aware features for query
decoding. Additionally, hybrid depth supervision is adopted for complementary
depth learning from both metric and distribution aspects. Extensive experiments
conducted on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority
of our proposed method.

TL;DR: PFGS是一个姿态感知的3D高斯泼溅框架，通过融合多姿态图像来重建完整物体，解决了单姿态重建中遮挡区域缺失的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3DGS方法假设物体在单一静态姿态下捕获，导致重建不完整，无法恢复被遮挡或自遮挡区域。需要处理多姿态图像捕获的实际挑战。

Method: PFGS采用姿态感知融合策略，结合全局和局部配准，将辅助姿态图像迭代融合到主姿态的统一3DGS表示中。利用背景特征进行单姿态相机姿态估计，使用基础模型进行跨姿态配准。

Result: 实验结果表明PFFS在定性和定量评估中均优于强基线方法，产生更完整的重建结果和更高保真度的3DGS模型。

Conclusion: PFGS通过智能整合基础模型到配准过程中，克服了高内存需求和精度不足的限制，实现了更完整和高质量的重建。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have enabled high-quality,
real-time novel-view synthesis from multi-view images. However, most existing
methods assume the object is captured in a single, static pose, resulting in
incomplete reconstructions that miss occluded or self-occluded regions. We
introduce PFGS, a pose-aware 3DGS framework that addresses the practical
challenge of reconstructing complete objects from multi-pose image captures.
Given images of an object in one main pose and several auxiliary poses, PFGS
iteratively fuses each auxiliary set into a unified 3DGS representation of the
main pose. Our pose-aware fusion strategy combines global and local
registration to merge views effectively and refine the 3DGS model. While recent
advances in 3D foundation models have improved registration robustness and
efficiency, they remain limited by high memory demands and suboptimal accuracy.
PFGS overcomes these challenges by incorporating them more intelligently into
the registration process: it leverages background features for per-pose camera
pose estimation and employs foundation models for cross-pose registration. This
design captures the best of both approaches while resolving background
inconsistency issues. Experimental results demonstrate that PFGS consistently
outperforms strong baselines in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations,
producing more complete reconstructions and higher-fidelity 3DGS models.

Conclusion: LILAC成功地将高质量运动风格化扩展到实时在线场景，为需要连续响应角色控制的应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Generating long and stylized human motions in real time is critical for
applications that demand continuous and responsive character control. Despite
its importance, existing streaming approaches often operate directly in the raw
motion space, leading to substantial computational overhead and making it
difficult to maintain temporal stability. In contrast, latent-space
VAE-Diffusion-based frameworks alleviate these issues and achieve high-quality
stylization, but they are generally confined to offline processing. To bridge
this gap, LILAC (Long-sequence Incremental Low-latency Arbitrary Motion
Stylization via Streaming VAE-Diffusion with Causal Decoding) builds upon a
recent high-performing offline framework for arbitrary motion stylization and
extends it to an online setting through a latent-space streaming architecture
with a sliding-window causal design and the injection of decoded motion
features to ensure smooth motion transitions. This architecture enables
long-sequence real-time arbitrary stylization without relying on future frames
or modifying the diffusion model architecture, achieving a favorable balance
between stylization quality and responsiveness as demonstrated by experiments
on benchmark datasets. Supplementary video and examples are available at the

Abstract: Most existing underwater instance segmentation approaches are constrained by
close-vocabulary prediction, limiting their ability to recognize novel marine
categories. To support evaluation, we introduce \textbf{MARIS}
(\underline{Mar}ine Open-Vocabulary \underline{I}nstance
\underline{S}egmentation), the first large-scale fine-grained benchmark for
underwater Open-Vocabulary (OV) segmentation, featuring a limited set of seen
categories and diverse unseen categories. Although OV segmentation has shown
promise on natural images, our analysis reveals that transfer to underwater
scenes suffers from severe visual degradation (e.g., color attenuation) and
semantic misalignment caused by lack underwater class definitions. To address
these issues, we propose a unified framework with two complementary components.
The Geometric Prior Enhancement Module (\textbf{GPEM}) leverages stable
part-level and structural cues to maintain object consistency under degraded
visual conditions. The Semantic Alignment Injection Mechanism (\textbf{SAIM})
enriches language embeddings with domain-specific priors, mitigating semantic
ambiguity and improving recognition of unseen categories. Experiments show that
our framework consistently outperforms existing OV baselines both In-Domain and
Cross-Domain setting on MARIS, establishing a strong foundation for future
underwater perception research.

Abstract: Clinical adoption of multi-shot diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging
(multi-shot DWI) for body-wide tumor diagnostics is limited by severe
motion-induced phase artifacts from respiration, peristalsis, and so on,
compounded by multi-organ, multi-slice, multi-direction and multi-b-value
complexities. Here, we introduce a reconstruction framework, LoSP-Prompt, that
overcomes these challenges through physics-informed modeling and
synthetic-data-driven prompt learning. We model inter-shot phase variations as
a high-order Locally Smooth Phase (LoSP), integrated into a low-rank Hankel
matrix reconstruction. Crucially, the algorithm's rank parameter is
automatically set via prompt learning trained exclusively on synthetic
abdominal DWI data emulating physiological motion. Validated across 10,000+
clinical images (43 subjects, 4 scanner models, 5 centers), LoSP-Prompt: (1)
Achieved twice the spatial resolution of clinical single-shot DWI, enhancing
liver lesion conspicuity; (2) Generalized to seven diverse anatomical regions
(liver, kidney, sacroiliac, pelvis, knee, spinal cord, brain) with a single
model; (3) Outperformed state-of-the-art methods in image quality, artifact
suppression, and noise reduction (11 radiologists' evaluations on a 5-point
scale, $p<0.05$), achieving 4-5 points (excellent) on kidney DWI, 4 points
(good to excellent) on liver, sacroiliac and spinal cord DWI, and 3-4 points
(good) on knee and tumor brain. The approach eliminates navigator signals and
realistic data supervision, providing an interpretable, robust solution for
high-resolution multi-organ multi-shot DWI. Its scanner-agnostic performance
signifies transformative potential for precision oncology.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Learning to Detect (LoD)框架，通过从攻击特定学习转向任务特定学习，准确检测未知的越狱攻击，包含多模态安全概念激活向量模块和无监督攻击分类的安全模式自动编码器模块。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管进行了广泛的对齐努力，大型视觉语言模型仍然容易受到越狱攻击，存在严重的安全风险。现有检测方法要么学习攻击特定参数，难以泛化到未见攻击，要么依赖启发式原则，限制了准确性和效率。

Method: 提出LoD框架，包括多模态安全概念激活向量模块用于安全导向的表示学习，以及安全模式自动编码器模块用于无监督攻击分类。

Result: 大量实验表明，该方法在多样未知攻击上实现了持续更高的检测AUROC，同时提高了效率。

Conclusion: LoD框架通过任务特定学习有效解决了现有越狱攻击检测方法的泛化和效率问题，为大型视觉语言模型的安全防护提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Despite extensive alignment efforts, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs)
remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, posing serious safety risks. To address
this, existing detection methods either learn attack-specific parameters, which
hinders generalization to unseen attacks, or rely on heuristically sound
principles, which limit accuracy and efficiency. To overcome these limitations,
we propose Learning to Detect (LoD), a general framework that accurately
detects unknown jailbreak attacks by shifting the focus from attack-specific
learning to task-specific learning. This framework includes a Multi-modal
Safety Concept Activation Vector module for safety-oriented representation
learning and a Safety Pattern Auto-Encoder module for unsupervised attack
classification. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves
consistently higher detection AUROC on diverse unknown attacks while improving
efficiency. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Semantic4Safety框架使用零样本语义分割从街景图像中提取11个可解释的街道景观指标，结合道路类型分析交通事故数据，通过XGBoost分类器和SHAP解释特征贡献，并应用GPS加权和ATE估计来量化因果效应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决街景图像在交通风险评估中的两个基本挑战：(1)如何构建捕捉事故相关特征的街道级指标，(2)如何量化这些指标对不同事故类型的因果影响。

Method: 使用零样本语义分割从街景图像中提取11个可解释的街道景观指标，结合道路类型作为上下文信息；训练XGBoost多类分类器，使用SHAP解释特征贡献；应用GPS加权和ATE估计来控制混杂因素并量化因果效应。

Result: 发现了异质性的、特定于事故类型的因果模式：捕捉场景复杂性、暴露度和道路几何形状的特征主导预测能力；更大的可驾驶区域和应急空间降低风险，而过度视觉开放性可能增加风险。

Conclusion: 通过将预测建模与因果推断相结合，Semantic4Safety支持有针对性的干预措施和高风险走廊诊断，为城市道路安全规划提供了一个可扩展的、数据驱动的工具。

Abstract: Street-view imagery (SVI) offers a fine-grained lens on traffic risk, yet two
fundamental challenges persist: (1) how to construct street-level indicators
that capture accident-related features, and (2) how to quantify their causal
impacts across different accident types. To address these challenges, we
propose Semantic4Safety, a framework that applies zero-shot semantic
segmentation to SVIs to derive 11 interpretable streetscape indicators, and
integrates road type as contextual information to analyze approximately 30,000
accident records in Austin. Specifically, we train an eXtreme Gradient Boosting
(XGBoost) multi-class classifier and use Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP)
to interpret both global and local feature contributions, and then apply
Generalized Propensity Score (GPS) weighting and Average Treatment Effect (ATE)
estimation to control confounding and quantify causal effects. Results uncover
heterogeneous, accident-type-specific causal patterns: features capturing scene
complexity, exposure, and roadway geometry dominate predictive power; larger
drivable area and emergency space reduce risk, whereas excessive visual
openness can increase it. By bridging predictive modeling with causal
inference, Semantic4Safety supports targeted interventions and high-risk
corridor diagnosis, offering a scalable, data-informed tool for urban road
safety planning.

TL;DR: 提出了预测-校正（PC）范式，通过解耦建模任务来加速学习，并基于此构建了PCMambaNet网络，在脑部MRI分割中仅需1-5个epoch就能达到最先进精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决端到端深度学习在医学影像等数据稀缺领域中收敛慢、依赖大规模数据集的问题，提高学习效率和适用性。

Method: 采用预测-校正范式，包含两个协同模块：预测先验模块（PPM）利用双侧对称性生成粗略的焦点图，校正残差网络（CRN）专注于学习残差误差并精炼关键区域。

Result: 在高分辨率脑部MRI分割实验中，PCMambaNet达到了最先进的精度，且仅需1-5个epoch就能收敛，这是传统端到端模型无法实现的性能。

Conclusion: 通过显式引入领域知识来简化学习目标，PCMambaNet有效缓解了数据效率低下和过拟合问题，实现了显著的学习加速。

Abstract: Despite the remarkable success of the end-to-end paradigm in deep learning,
it often suffers from slow convergence and heavy reliance on large-scale
datasets, which fundamentally limits its efficiency and applicability in
data-scarce domains such as medical imaging. In this work, we introduce the
Predictive-Corrective (PC) paradigm, a framework that decouples the modeling
task to fundamentally accelerate learning. Building upon this paradigm, we
propose a novel network, termed PCMambaNet. PCMambaNet is composed of two
synergistic modules. First, the Predictive Prior Module (PPM) generates a
coarse approximation at low computational cost, thereby anchoring the search
space. Specifically, the PPM leverages anatomical knowledge-bilateral
symmetry-to predict a 'focus map' of diagnostically relevant asymmetric
regions. Next, the Corrective Residual Network (CRN) learns to model the
residual error, focusing the network's full capacity on refining these
challenging regions and delineating precise pathological boundaries. Extensive
experiments on high-resolution brain MRI segmentation demonstrate that
PCMambaNet achieves state-of-the-art accuracy while converging within only 1-5
epochs-a performance unattainable by conventional end-to-end models. This
dramatic acceleration highlights that by explicitly incorporating domain
knowledge to simplify the learning objective, PCMambaNet effectively mitigates
data inefficiency and overfitting.

TL;DR: 提出证据优先的自适应框架EARL，通过强化学习让模型主动选择关键帧并进行局部重采样，在长视频推理任务中取得SOTA性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频大语言模型在长视频推理中存在信息稀释问题，静态均匀采样会模糊关键证据；现有像素空间视频推理代理缺乏严格的奖励机制来确保证据纯度，且无法在预采样帧之外进行时间信息补充

Method: 提出证据感知强化学习框架EARL，将模型转变为证据的主动询问者，动态选择最相关帧并在关键帧周围进行局部重采样以获取细粒度时间细节

Result: 在五个要求严苛的视频推理基准测试中，EARL训练模型在开源视频大语言模型中达到新的SOTA，7B模型在LongVideoBench、MVBench和VideoMME上分别达到59.8%、69.0%和64.9%

Conclusion: 结果强调了优先考虑证据纯度的重要性以及所提出框架的有效性

Abstract: Long-form video reasoning remains a major challenge for Video Large Language
Models (Video LLMs), as static uniform frame sampling leads to information
dilution and obscures critical evidence. Furthermore, existing pixel-space
video reasoning agents, which are designed to actively interact with the video
to acquire new visual information, remain suboptimal due to their lack of
rigorous reward mechanisms to enforce evidence purity and their inability to
perform temporal information supplementation beyond pre-sampled frames. To
address this critical gap, we propose a novel evidence-prioritized adaptive
framework built upon our core philosophy: "Select Less, Reason More." Our core
contribution is the evidence-aware reinforcement learning (EARL) framework,
which transforms the model into an active interrogator of evidence. EARL is
precisely engineered to dynamically select the most relevant frames and,
crucially, to perform localized re-sampling around the selected key frames to
access fine-grained temporal detail. Extensive experiments on five demanding
video reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our EARL-trained model achieves new
state-of-the-art among open-source Video LLMs, simultaneously learning an
effective and high-purity visual evidence selection policy. Impressively, our
7B model achieves 59.8% on LongVideoBench, 69.0% on MVBench and 64.9% on
VideoMME. These results highlight the importance of prioritizing evidence
purity and the effectiveness of our framework.

TL;DR: MAVR-Net是一个基于多视角学习的微型飞行器动作识别框架，通过结合RGB帧、光流和分割掩码三种互补数据，提升MAV运动识别的鲁棒性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于RGB数据的视觉识别模型难以捕捉微型飞行器复杂的时空运动特征，限制了区分不同动作的能力。

Method: 使用ResNet编码器从每个视角提取特征，采用多尺度特征金字塔保留时空细节，引入跨视角注意力模块建模模态间依赖关系，设计多视角对齐损失确保语义一致性。

Result: 在基准MAV动作数据集上，该方法在Short MAV、Medium MAV和Long MAV数据集上分别达到97.8%、96.5%和92.8%的准确率，明显优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MAVR-Net通过多视角学习和跨模态交互，有效提升了微型飞行器动作识别的性能，为自主空中群系统的协同感知和控制提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Recognizing the motion of Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) is crucial for
enabling cooperative perception and control in autonomous aerial swarms. Yet,
vision-based recognition models relying only on RGB data often fail to capture
the complex spatial temporal characteristics of MAV motion, which limits their
ability to distinguish different actions. To overcome this problem, this paper
presents MAVR-Net, a multi-view learning-based MAV action recognition
framework. Unlike traditional single-view methods, the proposed approach
combines three complementary types of data, including raw RGB frames, optical
flow, and segmentation masks, to improve the robustness and accuracy of MAV
motion recognition. Specifically, ResNet-based encoders are used to extract
discriminative features from each view, and a multi-scale feature pyramid is
adopted to preserve the spatiotemporal details of MAV motion patterns. To
enhance the interaction between different views, a cross-view attention module
is introduced to model the dependencies among various modalities and feature
scales. In addition, a multi-view alignment loss is designed to ensure semantic
consistency and strengthen cross-view feature representations. Experimental
results on benchmark MAV action datasets show that our method clearly
outperforms existing approaches, achieving 97.8\%, 96.5\%, and 92.8\% accuracy
on the Short MAV, Medium MAV, and Long MAV datasets, respectively.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DPTrack是一种基于提示学习的夜间航空跟踪器，通过将目标属性特征编码到包含细粒度线索的方向核中，生成精确的提示来改善夜间跟踪性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于提示学习的夜间航空跟踪器仅依赖空间定位监督，无法提供指向目标特征的细粒度线索，导致提示模糊，跟踪性能不佳。

Method: DPTrack首先分层捕获目标的拓扑结构，利用拓扑属性丰富特征表示；然后编码器将这些拓扑感知特征压缩到方向核中；最后基于通道-类别对应关系的核引导提示模块在搜索区域特征中传播核，定位目标特征位置并转换为精确提示。

Result: 在已建立的基准测试上进行广泛评估，证明了DPTrack的优越性能。

Conclusion: DPTrack通过编码目标属性特征到方向核中生成精确提示，有效解决了夜间航空跟踪中提示模糊的问题，实现了鲁棒的夜间跟踪。

Abstract: Existing nighttime aerial trackers based on prompt learning rely solely on
spatial localization supervision, which fails to provide fine-grained cues that
point to target features and inevitably produces vague prompts. This limitation
impairs the tracker's ability to accurately focus on the object features and
results in trackers still performing poorly. To address this issue, we propose
DPTrack, a prompt-based aerial tracker designed for nighttime scenarios by
encoding the given object's attribute features into the directional kernel
enriched with fine-grained cues to generate precise prompts. Specifically,
drawing inspiration from visual bionics, DPTrack first hierarchically captures
the object's topological structure, leveraging topological attributes to enrich
the feature representation. Subsequently, an encoder condenses these
topology-aware features into the directional kernel, which serves as the core
guidance signal that explicitly encapsulates the object's fine-grained
attribute cues. Finally, a kernel-guided prompt module built on
channel-category correspondence attributes propagates the kernel across the
features of the search region to pinpoint the positions of target features and
convert them into precise prompts, integrating spatial gating for robust
nighttime tracking. Extensive evaluations on established benchmarks demonstrate
DPTrack's superior performance. Our code will be available at
https://github.com/zzq-vipsl/DPTrack.

Motivation: 微表情识别面临标注数据稀缺的问题，现有方法主要依赖简单的空间增强而忽视时间增强策略，限制了运动模式的多样性捕捉。

Method: 将每个微表情序列分解为起始-顶点和顶点-结束两个运动阶段，为每个阶段生成独立的动态图像，形成双阶段动态图像增强策略。

Result: 在CASME-II和SAMM数据集上的实验表明，该方法在识别准确率、未加权F1分数和未加权平均召回率方面均有显著提升，与空间增强结合可获得高达10%的相对改进。

Conclusion: 该方法简单、模型无关且在低资源设置下有效，为鲁棒和可泛化的微表情识别提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Micro-expressions (MEs) are brief, involuntary facial movements that reveal
genuine emotions, typically lasting less than half a second. Recognizing these
subtle expressions is critical for applications in psychology, security, and
behavioral analysis. Although deep learning has enabled significant advances in
micro-expression recognition (MER), its effectiveness is limited by the
scarcity of annotated ME datasets. This data limitation not only hinders
generalization but also restricts the diversity of motion patterns captured
during training. Existing MER studies predominantly rely on simple spatial
augmentations (e.g., flipping, rotation) and overlook temporal augmentation
strategies that can better exploit motion characteristics. To address this gap,
this paper proposes a phase-aware temporal augmentation method based on dynamic
image. Rather than encoding the entire expression as a single onset-to-offset
dynamic image (DI), our approach decomposes each expression sequence into two
motion phases: onset-to-apex and apex-to-offset. A separate DI is generated for
each phase, forming a Dual-phase DI augmentation strategy. These phase-specific
representations enrich motion diversity and introduce complementary temporal
cues that are crucial for recognizing subtle facial transitions. Extensive
experiments on CASME-II and SAMM datasets using six deep architectures,
including CNNs, Vision Transformer, and the lightweight LEARNet, demonstrate
consistent performance improvements in recognition accuracy, unweighted
F1-score, and unweighted average recall, which are crucial for addressing class
imbalance in MER. When combined with spatial augmentations, our method achieves
up to a 10\% relative improvement. The proposed augmentation is simple,
model-agnostic, and effective in low-resource settings, offering a promising
direction for robust and generalizable MER.

Motivation: 传统SfM方法在应用于多相机系统捕捉的驾驶场景时存在相机位姿估计不可靠、路面重建异常点多、重建效率低等问题，需要专门针对驾驶场景的改进方案。

Method: 1. 利用多相机系统的固定空间关系提升相机位姿估计可靠性；2. 使用平面模型有效去除三角化路面中的错误点；3. 将多相机系统作为单一单元进行束调整以减少优化变量；4. 通过场景关联和组装模块实现多场景聚合。

Result: 在真实车辆上部署验证了MRASfM在不同场景下的泛化能力和恶劣条件下的鲁棒性。在公开数据集上的大规模验证显示，在nuScenes数据集上达到了0.124的绝对位姿误差，实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: MRASfM框架专门针对驾驶场景的多相机系统设计，通过多种技术改进有效解决了传统SfM在驾驶场景中面临的问题，在真实应用中表现出良好的泛化能力和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Structure from Motion (SfM) estimates camera poses and reconstructs point
clouds, forming a foundation for various tasks. However, applying SfM to
driving scenes captured by multi-camera systems presents significant
difficulties, including unreliable pose estimation, excessive outliers in road
surface reconstruction, and low reconstruction efficiency. To address these
limitations, we propose a Multi-camera Reconstruction and Aggregation
Structure-from-Motion (MRASfM) framework specifically designed for driving
scenes. MRASfM enhances the reliability of camera pose estimation by leveraging
the fixed spatial relationships within the multi-camera system during the
registration process. To improve the quality of road surface reconstruction,
our framework employs a plane model to effectively remove erroneous points from
the triangulated road surface. Moreover, treating the multi-camera set as a
single unit in Bundle Adjustment (BA) helps reduce optimization variables to
boost efficiency. In addition, MRASfM achieves multi-scene aggregation through
scene association and assembly modules in a coarse-to-fine fashion. We deployed
multi-camera systems on actual vehicles to validate the generalizability of
MRASfM across various scenes and its robustness in challenging conditions
through real-world applications. Furthermore, large-scale validation results on
public datasets show the state-of-the-art performance of MRASfM, achieving
0.124 absolute pose error on the nuScenes dataset.

Motivation: 随着无人机技术的发展，视频数据量急剧增加，迫切需要高效的语义检索方法。无人机视频具有俯视视角、结构同质性强、目标组合语义表达多样等特点，现有面向地面视角的跨模态方法难以有效建模这些特征。

Abstract: With the advancement of drone technology, the volume of video data increases
rapidly, creating an urgent need for efficient semantic retrieval. We are the
first to systematically propose and study the drone video-text retrieval (DVTR)
task. Drone videos feature overhead perspectives, strong structural
homogeneity, and diverse semantic expressions of target combinations, which
challenge existing cross-modal methods designed for ground-level views in
effectively modeling their characteristics. Therefore, dedicated retrieval
mechanisms tailored for drone scenarios are necessary. To address this issue,
we propose a novel approach called Multi-Semantic Adaptive Mining (MSAM). MSAM
introduces a multi-semantic adaptive learning mechanism, which incorporates
dynamic changes between frames and extracts rich semantic information from
specific scene regions, thereby enhancing the deep understanding and reasoning
of drone video content. This method relies on fine-grained interactions between
words and drone video frames, integrating an adaptive semantic construction
module, a distribution-driven semantic learning term and a diversity semantic
term to deepen the interaction between text and drone video modalities and
improve the robustness of feature representation. To reduce the interference of
complex backgrounds in drone videos, we introduce a cross-modal interactive
feature fusion pooling mechanism that focuses on feature extraction and
matching in target regions, minimizing noise effects. Extensive experiments on
two self-constructed drone video-text datasets show that MSAM outperforms other
existing methods in the drone video-text retrieval task. The source code and
dataset will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Facial micro-expressions are brief, involuntary facial movements that reveal

a Combined Optical Flow (COF), integrating both phases to enhance feature

MER performance. Experimental results on CASMEII and SAMM datasets show that
COF outperforms single optical flow-based methods, demonstrating its
effectiveness in capturing micro-expression dynamics.

Abstract: 3D phenotyping of plants plays a crucial role for understanding plant growth,
yield prediction, and disease control. We present a pipeline capable of
generating high-quality 3D reconstructions of individual agricultural plants.
To acquire data, a small commercially available UAV captures images of a
selected plant. Apart from placing ArUco markers, the entire image acquisition
process is fully autonomous, controlled by a self-developed Android application
running on the drone's controller. The reconstruction task is particularly
challenging due to environmental wind and downwash of the UAV. Our proposed
pipeline supports the integration of arbitrary state-of-the-art 3D
reconstruction methods. To mitigate errors caused by leaf motion during image
capture, we use an iterative method that gradually adjusts the input images
through deformation. Motion is estimated using optical flow between the
original input images and intermediate 3D reconstructions rendered from the
corresponding viewpoints. This alignment gradually reduces scene motion,
resulting in a canonical representation. After a few iterations, our pipeline
improves the reconstruction of state-of-the-art methods and enables the
extraction of high-resolution 3D meshes. We will publicly release the source
code of our reconstruction pipeline. Additionally, we provide a dataset
consisting of multiple plants from various crops, captured across different
points in time.

Conclusion: HiMA架构通过有效结合不同模块的优势，在低光RAW图像增强任务中实现了高质量和高效率的平衡。

Abstract: Low-light RAW image enhancement remains a challenging task. Although numerous
deep learning based approaches have been proposed, they still suffer from
inherent limitations. A key challenge is how to simultaneously achieve strong
enhancement quality and high efficiency. In this paper, we rethink the
architecture for efficient low-light image signal processing (ISP) and
introduce a Hierarchical Mixing Architecture (HiMA). HiMA leverages the
complementary strengths of Transformer and Mamba modules to handle features at
large and small scales, respectively, thereby improving efficiency while
avoiding the ambiguities observed in prior two-stage frameworks. To further
address uneven illumination with strong local variations, we propose Local
Distribution Adjustment (LoDA), which adaptively aligns feature distributions
across different local regions. In addition, to fully exploit the denoised
outputs from the first stage, we design a Multi-prior Fusion (MPF) module that
integrates spatial and frequency-domain priors for detail enhancement.
Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets demonstrate that our method
outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving superior performance with
fewer parameters. Code will be released at https://github.com/Cynicarlos/HiMA.

Motivation: 现代人脸识别模型存在系统性偏见，传统偏见评估框架依赖标记属性，成本高且限于预定义类别。

Method: 使用潜在特征对齐算法，通过潜在方向识别子群体，实现语义一致的聚类和可解释方向的发现。

subpopulations. This yields two main benefits over standard clustering: (i)
semantically coherent grouping, where faces sharing common attributes are
grouped together more reliably than by proximity-based methods, and (ii)
discovery of interpretable directions, which correspond to semantic attributes
such as age, ethnicity, or attire. Across four state-of-the-art recognition
models (ArcFace, CosFace, ElasticFace, PartialFC) and two benchmarks (RFW,
CelebA), LFA consistently outperforms k-means and nearest-neighbor search in
intra-group semantic coherence, while uncovering interpretable latent
directions aligned with demographic and contextual attributes. These results
position LFA as a practical method for representation auditing of face
recognition models, enabling practitioners to identify and interpret biased
subpopulations without predefined attribute annotations.

*Aditya Vir*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种用于卫星土地利用分类的自定义卷积神经网络架构，在EuroSAT数据集上达到97.23%的测试准确率，无需预训练模型。主要贡献是平衡多任务注意力机制，结合空间和光谱特征提取。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决卫星图像分类中的特定失败模式，探索系统化架构设计在领域特定应用中的有效性，避免依赖预训练模型。

Method: 通过三个渐进架构迭代：基线架构、CBAM增强架构和平衡多任务注意力架构。采用坐标注意力进行空间特征提取，挤压激励块进行光谱特征提取，通过可学习融合参数统一两者。使用渐进DropBlock正则化和类别平衡损失加权。

Result: 最终12层架构达到97.23%测试准确率，Cohen's Kappa为0.9692，所有类别准确率超过94.46%。可学习参数自主收敛到alpha≈0.57，表明空间和光谱模态重要性接近相等。性能与微调ResNet-50（98.57%）相差仅1.34%。

Conclusion: 系统化架构设计在卫星图像分类中具有显著效果，无需外部数据即可达到接近预训练模型的性能，验证了领域特定应用的有效性。

Abstract: This work presents a systematic investigation of custom convolutional neural
network architectures for satellite land use classification, achieving 97.23%
test accuracy on the EuroSAT dataset without reliance on pre-trained models.
Through three progressive architectural iterations (baseline: 94.30%,
CBAM-enhanced: 95.98%, and balanced multi-task attention: 97.23%) we identify
and address specific failure modes in satellite imagery classification. Our
principal contribution is a novel balanced multi-task attention mechanism that
combines Coordinate Attention for spatial feature extraction with
Squeeze-Excitation blocks for spectral feature extraction, unified through a
learnable fusion parameter. Experimental results demonstrate that this
learnable parameter autonomously converges to alpha approximately 0.57,
indicating near-equal importance of spatial and spectral modalities for
satellite imagery. We employ progressive DropBlock regularization (5-20% by
network depth) and class-balanced loss weighting to address overfitting and
confusion pattern imbalance. The final 12-layer architecture achieves Cohen's
Kappa of 0.9692 with all classes exceeding 94.46% accuracy, demonstrating
confidence calibration with a 24.25% gap between correct and incorrect
predictions. Our approach achieves performance within 1.34% of fine-tuned
ResNet-50 (98.57%) while requiring no external data, validating the efficacy of
systematic architectural design for domain-specific applications. Complete
code, trained models, and evaluation scripts are publicly available.

TL;DR: SiM2P是一种基于3D扩散桥的框架，能够从MRI和患者辅助信息生成诊断质量的FDG-PET图像，显著提高了痴呆症诊断准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FDG-PET在痴呆症诊断中很重要，但相比常规MRI，其可及性差且成本高。需要一种方法让更多患者受益于PET的诊断优势。

Method: 开发了SiM2P框架，使用3D扩散桥模型学习从MRI和患者信息到FDG-PET的概率映射，生成模拟PET图像。

Result: 在盲法临床研究中，SiM2P将三组（阿尔茨海默病、行为变异型额颞叶痴呆、健康对照）的总体诊断准确率从75.0%提高到84.7%，且诊断确定性更高，评分者间一致性更好。

Conclusion: SiM2P框架使FDG-PET的诊断优势更易获得，只需20例特定站点病例和基本人口统计信息即可部署，有望改善资源有限环境中的早期检测和鉴别诊断。

Abstract: Positron emission tomography (PET) with 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) is an
established tool in the diagnostic workup of patients with suspected dementing
disorders. However, compared to the routinely available magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI), FDG-PET remains significantly less accessible and substantially
more expensive. Here, we present SiM2P, a 3D diffusion bridge-based framework
that learns a probabilistic mapping from MRI and auxiliary patient information
to simulate FDG-PET images of diagnostic quality. In a blinded clinical reader
study, two neuroradiologists and two nuclear medicine physicians rated the
original MRI and SiM2P-simulated PET images of patients with Alzheimer's
disease, behavioral-variant frontotemporal dementia, and cognitively healthy
controls. SiM2P significantly improved the overall diagnostic accuracy of
differentiating between three groups from 75.0% to 84.7% (p<0.05). Notably, the
simulated PET images received higher diagnostic certainty ratings and achieved
superior interrater agreement compared to the MRI images. Finally, we developed
a practical workflow for local deployment of the SiM2P framework. It requires
as few as 20 site-specific cases and only basic demographic information. This
approach makes the established diagnostic benefits of FDG-PET imaging more
accessible to patients with suspected dementing disorders, potentially
improving early detection and differential diagnosis in resource-limited
settings. Our code is available at https://github.com/Yiiitong/SiM2P.

Motivation: 解决历史档案文档分析中的挑战，包括运动模糊、手写变化、曝光波动和杂乱背景等问题，为低资源环境下的OCR和文档理解提供现实测试平台。

Method: 从127个二战时期的档案视频片段中提取包含拍板的生产元数据，提供完整的帧标注和裁剪的单词图像，支持旋转边界框的精确OCR应用。

Result: 在零样本和微调条件下评估了6个识别模型和7个检测模型，尽管训练集较小（18个视频），微调仍带来显著的性能提升，适合少样本学习场景。

Conclusion: ClapperText为低资源档案环境下的鲁棒OCR和文档理解提供了现实且文化基础丰富的资源，数据集和评估代码已开源。

Abstract: This paper presents ClapperText, a benchmark dataset for handwritten and
printed text recognition in visually degraded and low-resource settings. The
dataset is derived from 127 World War II-era archival video segments containing
clapperboards that record structured production metadata such as date,
location, and camera-operator identity. ClapperText includes 9,813 annotated
frames and 94,573 word-level text instances, 67% of which are handwritten and
1,566 are partially occluded. Each instance includes transcription, semantic
category, text type, and occlusion status, with annotations available as
rotated bounding boxes represented as 4-point polygons to support spatially
precise OCR applications. Recognizing clapperboard text poses significant
challenges, including motion blur, handwriting variation, exposure
fluctuations, and cluttered backgrounds, mirroring broader challenges in
historical document analysis where structured content appears in degraded,
non-standard forms. We provide both full-frame annotations and cropped word
images to support downstream tasks. Using a consistent per-video evaluation
protocol, we benchmark six representative recognition and seven detection
models under zero-shot and fine-tuned conditions. Despite the small training
set (18 videos), fine-tuning leads to substantial performance gains,
highlighting ClapperText's suitability for few-shot learning scenarios. The
dataset offers a realistic and culturally grounded resource for advancing
robust OCR and document understanding in low-resource archival contexts. The

Conclusion: 该方法能够生成艺术性和连贯的3D场景布局，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Generating artistic and coherent 3D scene layouts is crucial in digital
content creation. Traditional optimization-based methods are often constrained
by cumbersome manual rules, while deep generative models face challenges in
producing content with richness and diversity. Furthermore, approaches that
utilize large language models frequently lack robustness and fail to accurately
capture complex spatial relationships. To address these challenges, this paper
presents a novel vision-guided 3D layout generation system. We first construct
a high-quality asset library containing 2,037 scene assets and 147 3D scene
layouts. Subsequently, we employ an image generation model to expand prompt
representations into images, fine-tuning it to align with our asset library. We
then develop a robust image parsing module to recover the 3D layout of scenes
based on visual semantics and geometric information. Finally, we optimize the
scene layout using scene graphs and overall visual semantics to ensure logical
coherence and alignment with the images. Extensive user testing demonstrates
that our algorithm significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of
layout richness and quality. The code and dataset will be available at

TL;DR: 提出一种多视角架构来增强DeepFake检测，通过全局、中观和局部三个专用编码器分析面部特征，并结合面部朝向编码器，在各种姿态和光照条件下实现优越的检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的DeepFake检测方法在真实世界条件下难以处理姿态变化、遮挡和难以检测的伪影，需要更鲁棒的检测方案。

Method: 集成三个专用编码器：全局视角编码器检测边界不一致性，中观视角编码器分析纹理和颜色对齐，局部视角编码器捕捉眼睛、鼻子、嘴巴等表情区域中的扭曲。另外加入面部朝向编码器来分类面部姿态。

Result: 在具有挑战性的数据集上的实验结果表明，该方法优于传统的单视角方法，在各种姿态和光照条件下都能有效检测被篡改的图像。

Conclusion: 多视角架构通过融合不同层次的面部特征分析，显著提升了DeepFake检测的鲁棒性和准确性，特别是在复杂现实场景中表现优异。

Abstract: DeepFake technology has advanced significantly in recent years, enabling the
creation of highly realistic synthetic face images. Existing DeepFake detection
methods often struggle with pose variations, occlusions, and artifacts that are
difficult to detect in real-world conditions. To address these challenges, we
propose a multi-view architecture that enhances DeepFake detection by analyzing
facial features at multiple levels. Our approach integrates three specialized
encoders, a global view encoder for detecting boundary inconsistencies, a
middle view encoder for analyzing texture and color alignment, and a local view
encoder for capturing distortions in expressive facial regions such as the
eyes, nose, and mouth, where DeepFake artifacts frequently occur. Additionally,
we incorporate a face orientation encoder, trained to classify face poses,
ensuring robust detection across various viewing angles. By fusing features
from these encoders, our model achieves superior performance in detecting
manipulated images, even under challenging pose and lighting
conditions.Experimental results on challenging datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method, outperforming conventional single-view approaches

Method: 用固定通道方法替代U-Net生成器中的传统通道倍增策略，大幅减少可训练参数，并利用GAN学习高质量成像特征。

Result: 参数从4180万减少到约9000个，性能更优，训练更快，内存使用更低，并能检测实验中的问题如光漂白、伪影等。

Conclusion: 该模型不仅是高效的模态转换工具，也是验证显微镜工作流中实验准确性和图像保真度的实用诊断工具。

Abstract: Lightweight deep learning models offer substantial reductions in
computational cost and environmental impact, making them crucial for scientific
applications. We present a lightweight CycleGAN for modality transfer in
fluorescence microscopy (confocal to super-resolution STED/deconvolved STED),
addressing the common challenge of unpaired datasets. By replacing the
traditional channel-doubling strategy in the U-Net-based generator with a fixed
channel approach, we drastically reduce trainable parameters from 41.8 million
to approximately nine thousand, achieving superior performance with faster
training and lower memory usage. We also introduce the GAN as a diagnostic tool
for experimental and labeling quality. When trained on high-quality images, the
GAN learns the characteristics of optimal imaging; deviations between its
generated outputs and new experimental images can reveal issues such as
photobleaching, artifacts, or inaccurate labeling. This establishes the model
as a practical tool for validating experimental accuracy and image fidelity in
microscopy workflows.

Motivation: 为了促进时空图像融合方法的应用，需要解决不同传感器图像空间和光谱分辨率不匹配的问题。

Method: 比较了两种标准化方法：1)传统上采样方法；2)ABSIS锐化方法，该方法将高分辨率图像的整体特征与特定低分辨率图像的独特属性融合。

Result: 两种方法都显著提高了USTFIP时空融合方法的准确性，其中锐化方法将融合图像的光谱和空间准确性分别提高了49.46%和78.40%。

Conclusion: 提出的标准化方法，特别是ABSIS锐化方法，能够有效提升时空图像融合的性能，生成更接近高分辨率图像聚合结果的标准图像。

Abstract: Spatio-Temporal Image Fusion (STIF) methods usually require sets of images
with matching spatial and spectral resolutions captured by different sensors.
To facilitate the application of STIF methods, we propose and compare two
different standardization approaches. The first method is based on traditional
upscaling of the fine-resolution images. The second method is a sharpening
approach called Anomaly Based Satellite Image Standardization (ABSIS) that
blends the overall features found in the fine-resolution image series with the
distinctive attributes of a specific coarse-resolution image to produce images
that more closely resemble the outcome of aggregating the fine-resolution
images. Both methods produce a significant increase in accuracy of the Unpaired
Spatio Temporal Fusion of Image Patches (USTFIP) STIF method, with the
sharpening approach increasing the spectral and spatial accuracies of the fused
images by up to 49.46\% and 78.40\%, respectively.

Result: 在广泛实验中，FlexiReID实现了最先进的性能，在复杂场景中表现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: FlexiReID框架成功解决了多模态行人重识别的灵活性需求，为实际应用提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal person re-identification (Re-ID) aims to match pedestrian images
across different modalities. However, most existing methods focus on limited
cross-modal settings and fail to support arbitrary query-retrieval
combinations, hindering practical deployment. We propose FlexiReID, a flexible
framework that supports seven retrieval modes across four modalities: rgb,
infrared, sketches, and text. FlexiReID introduces an adaptive
mixture-of-experts (MoE) mechanism to dynamically integrate diverse modality
features and a cross-modal query fusion module to enhance multimodal feature
extraction. To facilitate comprehensive evaluation, we construct CIRS-PEDES, a
unified dataset extending four popular Re-ID datasets to include all four
modalities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FlexiReID achieves
state-of-the-art performance and offers strong generalization in complex
scenarios.

Conclusion: QFCA方法在保持高精度的同时实现了实时性能，适用于实际部署场景

Abstract: Zero-shot anomaly localization is a rising field in computer vision research,
with important progress in recent years. This work focuses on the problem of
detecting and localizing anomalies in textures, where anomalies can be defined
as the regions that deviate from the overall statistics, violating the
stationarity assumption. The main limitation of existing methods is their high
running time, making them impractical for deployment in real-world scenarios,
such as assembly line monitoring. We propose a real-time method, named QFCA,
which implements a quantized version of the feature correspondence analysis
(FCA) algorithm. By carefully adapting the patch statistics comparison to work
on histograms of quantized values, we obtain a 10x speedup with little to no
loss in accuracy. Moreover, we introduce a feature preprocessing step based on
principal component analysis, which enhances the contrast between normal and
anomalous features, improving the detection precision on complex textures. Our
method is thoroughly evaluated against prior art, comparing favorably with
existing methods. Project page:

Conclusion: 该方法的效率、低计算成本和无数据特性使其成为生物医学成像的有价值工具，解决了干净训练数据稀缺的问题，同时实现快速推理。

Abstract: Current self-supervised denoising techniques achieve impressive results, yet
their real-world application is frequently constrained by substantial
computational and memory demands, necessitating a compromise between inference
speed and reconstruction quality. In this paper, we present an
ultra-lightweight model that addresses this challenge, achieving both fast
denoising and high quality image restoration. Built upon the Noise2Noise
training framework-which removes the reliance on clean reference images or
explicit noise modeling-we introduce an innovative multistage denoising
pipeline named Noise2Detail (N2D). During inference, this approach disrupts the
spatial correlations of noise patterns to produce intermediate smooth
structures, which are subsequently refined to recapture fine details directly
from the noisy input. Extensive testing reveals that Noise2Detail surpasses
existing dataset-free techniques in performance, while requiring only a
fraction of the computational resources. This combination of efficiency, low
computational cost, and data-free approach make it a valuable tool for
biomedical imaging, overcoming the challenges of scarce clean training data-due
to rare and complex imaging modalities-while enabling fast inference for
practical use.

Abstract: Domain adaptation is a crucial and increasingly important task in remote
sensing, aiming to transfer knowledge from a source domain a differently
distributed target domain. It has broad applications across various real-world
applications, including remote sensing element interpretation, ecological
environment monitoring, and urban/rural planning. However, domain adaptation in
remote sensing poses significant challenges due to differences in data, such as
variations in ground sampling distance, imaging modes from various sensors,
geographical landscapes, and environmental conditions. In recent years, deep
learning has emerged as a powerful tool for feature representation and
cross-domain knowledge transfer, leading to widespread adoption in remote
sensing tasks. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of significant
advancements in deep learning based domain adaptation for remote sensing. We
first introduce the preliminary knowledge to clarify key concepts, mathematical
notations, and the taxonomy of methodologies. We then organize existing
algorithms from multiple perspectives, including task categorization, input
mode, supervision paradigm, and algorithmic granularity, providing readers with
a structured understanding of the field. Next, we review widely used datasets
and summarize the performance of state-of-the-art methods to provide an
overview of current progress. We also identify open challenges and potential
directions to guide future research in domain adaptation for remote sensing.
Compared to previous surveys, this work addresses a broader range of domain
adaptation tasks in remote sensing, rather than concentrating on a few
subfields. It also presents a systematic taxonomy, providing a more
comprehensive and organized understanding of the field. As a whole, this survey
can inspire the research community, foster understanding, and guide future work
in the field.

Conclusion: 提出的弱监督框架在超声图像分割中具有有效性和实用性，为医学图像分析提供了高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Automatic medical image segmentation is a fundamental step in computer-aided
diagnosis, yet fully supervised approaches demand extensive pixel-level
annotations that are costly and time-consuming. To alleviate this burden, we
propose a weakly supervised segmentation framework that leverages only four
extreme points as annotation. Specifically, bounding boxes derived from the
extreme points are used as prompts for the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) to
generate reliable initial pseudo labels. These pseudo labels are progressively
refined by an enhanced Feature-Guided Extreme Point Masking (FGEPM) algorithm,
which incorporates Monte Carlo dropout-based uncertainty estimation to
construct a unified gradient uncertainty cost map for boundary tracing.
Furthermore, a dual-branch Uncertainty-aware Scale Consistency (USC) loss and a
box alignment loss are introduced to ensure spatial consistency and precise
boundary alignment during training. Extensive experiments on two public
ultrasound datasets, BUSI and UNS, demonstrate that our method achieves
performance comparable to, and even surpassing fully supervised counterparts
while significantly reducing annotation cost. These results validate the
effectiveness and practicality of the proposed weakly supervised framework for
ultrasound image segmentation.

Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) presents a complementary alternative to
supervised learning for brain tumor segmentation in magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI), particularly when annotated datasets are limited, costly, or
inconsistent. In this work, we propose a novel Multimodal Vision Transformer
Autoencoder (MViT-AE) trained exclusively on healthy brain MRIs to detect and
localize tumors via reconstruction-based error maps. This unsupervised paradigm
enables segmentation without reliance on manual labels, addressing a key
scalability bottleneck in neuroimaging workflows. Our method is evaluated in
the BraTS-GoAT 2025 Lighthouse dataset, which includes various types of tumors
such as gliomas, meningiomas, and pediatric brain tumors. To enhance
performance, we introduce a multimodal early-late fusion strategy that
leverages complementary information across multiple MRI sequences, and a
post-processing pipeline that integrates the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to
refine predicted tumor contours. Despite the known challenges of UAD,
particularly in detecting small or non-enhancing lesions, our method achieves
clinically meaningful tumor localization, with lesion-wise Dice Similarity
Coefficient of 0.437 (Whole Tumor), 0.316 (Tumor Core), and 0.350 (Enhancing
Tumor) on the test set, and an anomaly Detection Rate of 89.4% on the
validation set. These findings highlight the potential of transformer-based
unsupervised models to serve as scalable, label-efficient tools for
neuro-oncological imaging.

TL;DR: 提出了UniMedVL，首个医学统一多模态模型，能在单一架构中同时处理图像理解和生成任务，解决了现有医学AI系统将这两种能力分离的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学AI系统破坏了统一的诊断流程：图像理解模型只能解释图像但不能生成视觉输出，而图像生成模型只能合成图像但不能提供文本解释，导致数据表示、特征集成和任务级多模态能力存在差距。

Method: 采用观察-知识-分析(OKA)范式：观察层构建UniMed-5M数据集（560万样本）；知识层提出渐进式课程学习；分析层开发UniMedVL统一多模态模型。

Result: 在5个医学图像理解基准测试中表现优异，在8种医学成像模态的生成质量上与专用模型相当。双向知识共享：生成任务增强了视觉理解特征。

Conclusion: 将传统分离的能力整合到单一医学框架中，可在多样化的医学视觉语言任务中实现改进，证明了统一架构的价值。

Abstract: Medical diagnostic applications require models that can process multimodal
medical inputs (images, patient histories, lab results) and generate diverse
outputs including both textual reports and visual content (annotations,
segmentation masks, and images). Despite this need, existing medical AI systems
disrupt this unified process: medical image understanding models interpret
images but cannot generate visual outputs, while medical image generation
models synthesize images but cannot provide textual explanations. This leads to
gaps in data representation, feature integration, and task-level multimodal
capabilities. To this end, we propose a multi-level framework that draws
inspiration from diagnostic workflows through the
Observation-Knowledge-Analysis (OKA) paradigm. Specifically, at the observation
level, we construct UniMed-5M, a dataset comprising over 5.6M samples that
reformat diverse unimodal data into multimodal pairs for foundational
observation. At the knowledge level, we propose Progressive Curriculum Learning
that systematically introduces medical multimodal knowledge. At the analysis
level, we introduce UniMedVL, the first medical unified multimodal model for
the simultaneous analysis of image understanding and generation tasks within a
single architecture. UniMedVL achieves superior performance on five medical
image understanding benchmarks, while matching specialized models in generation
quality across eight medical imaging modalities. Crucially, our unified
architecture enables bidirectional knowledge sharing: generation tasks enhance
visual understanding features, demonstrating that integrating traditionally
separate capabilities within a single medical framework unlocks improvements
across diverse medical vision-language tasks. Code is available at

*Tingyu Lin,Armin Dadras,Florian Kleber,Robert Sablatnig*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了DGME-T方法，通过注入方向性网格运动编码来增强Video Swin Transformer，显著提升了在档案影片和现代视频上的相机运动分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有相机运动分类模型在档案影片上性能下降的问题，因为档案影片存在噪声、缺失帧和低对比度等退化特征，会模糊运动线索。

Method: 构建统一基准数据集，并提出了DGME-T方法——在Video Swin Transformer基础上通过可学习的归一化后期融合层注入基于光流的方向性网格运动编码。

Result: DGME-T将骨干网络的top-1准确率从81.78%提升到86.14%，宏F1从82.08%提升到87.81%（现代片段）；在二战档案影片上准确率从83.43%提升到84.62%，宏F1从81.72%提升到82.63%。跨域研究显示在现代数据上进行中间微调可将历史性能提升超过5个百分点。

Conclusion: 结构化运动先验和Transformer表示是互补的，即使是一个小型、精心校准的运动头也能显著增强在退化影片分析中的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Camera movement classification (CMC) models trained on contemporary,
high-quality footage often degrade when applied to archival film, where noise,
missing frames, and low contrast obscure motion cues. We bridge this gap by
assembling a unified benchmark that consolidates two modern corpora into four
canonical classes and restructures the HISTORIAN collection into five balanced
categories. Building on this benchmark, we introduce DGME-T, a lightweight
extension to the Video Swin Transformer that injects directional grid motion
encoding, derived from optical flow, via a learnable and normalised late-fusion
layer. DGME-T raises the backbone's top-1 accuracy from 81.78% to 86.14% and
its macro F1 from 82.08% to 87.81% on modern clips, while still improving the
demanding World-War-II footage from 83.43% to 84.62% accuracy and from 81.72%
to 82.63% macro F1. A cross-domain study further shows that an intermediate
fine-tuning stage on modern data increases historical performance by more than
five percentage points. These results demonstrate that structured motion priors
and transformer representations are complementary and that even a small,
carefully calibrated motion head can substantially enhance robustness in
degraded film analysis. Related resources are available at

Motivation: 基于指令的视频编辑技术因缺乏大规模高质量训练数据而发展受限，需要解决数据稀缺这一根本性挑战。

Method: 1. 融合领先图像编辑器和上下文视频生成器的数据生成管道；2. 采用高效蒸馏模型架构和时序增强器；3. 智能代理系统负责生成多样化指令并严格筛选输出；4. 使用课程学习策略训练模型。

Conclusion: Ditto框架成功解决了基于指令的视频编辑中的数据稀缺问题，建立的Editto模型在该领域达到了新的最先进水平，为视频内容创作民主化提供了有力支持。

Abstract: Instruction-based video editing promises to democratize content creation, yet
its progress is severely hampered by the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality
training data. We introduce Ditto, a holistic framework designed to tackle this
fundamental challenge. At its heart, Ditto features a novel data generation
pipeline that fuses the creative diversity of a leading image editor with an
in-context video generator, overcoming the limited scope of existing models. To
make this process viable, our framework resolves the prohibitive cost-quality
trade-off by employing an efficient, distilled model architecture augmented by
a temporal enhancer, which simultaneously reduces computational overhead and
improves temporal coherence. Finally, to achieve full scalability, this entire
pipeline is driven by an intelligent agent that crafts diverse instructions and
rigorously filters the output, ensuring quality control at scale. Using this
framework, we invested over 12,000 GPU-days to build Ditto-1M, a new dataset of
one million high-fidelity video editing examples. We trained our model, Editto,
on Ditto-1M with a curriculum learning strategy. The results demonstrate
superior instruction-following ability and establish a new state-of-the-art in
instruction-based video editing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法采用单步推理框架，缺乏反馈式自校正机制，在复杂元素布局规划时失败率显著增加。

Method: SEGA方法采用分层推理框架：粗粒度模块粗略估计布局规划结果，细化模块对粗规划结果进行细粒度推理，并融入布局设计原则作为先验知识。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上实现了最先进的结果，证明了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: SEGA通过分层推理和从粗到细的策略，结合布局设计原则，显著提升了内容感知布局生成的性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we study the content-aware layout generation problem, which
aims to automatically generate layouts that are harmonious with a given
background image. Existing methods usually deal with this task with a
single-step reasoning framework. The lack of a feedback-based self-correction
mechanism leads to their failure rates significantly increasing when faced with
complex element layout planning. To address this challenge, we introduce SEGA,
a novel Stepwise Evolution Paradigm for Content-Aware Layout Generation.
Inspired by the systematic mode of human thinking, SEGA employs a hierarchical
reasoning framework with a coarse-to-fine strategy: first, a coarse-level
module roughly estimates the layout planning results; then, another refining
module performs fine-level reasoning regarding the coarse planning results.
Furthermore, we incorporate layout design principles as prior knowledge into
the model to enhance its layout planning ability. Besides, we present
GenPoster-100K that is a new large-scale poster dataset with rich
meta-information annotation. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of
our approach by achieving the state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmark
datasets. Our project page is at: https://brucew91.github.io/SEGA.github.io/

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了NDM框架，首个基于噪声的检测和缓解方法，用于检测和缓解文本到图像生成中的隐含恶意意图，同时保持模型生成能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到图像扩散模型容易生成不当内容，特别是面对隐含的性暗示提示时。现有检测方法主要针对显式内容，无法有效检测这些隐含提示，而微调方法会降低生成质量。

Method: 提出噪声驱动的检测和缓解框架NDM：1）利用早期预测噪声的可分离性开发基于噪声的检测方法；2）提出噪声增强的自适应负引导机制，通过抑制显著区域的注意力来优化初始噪声。

Result: 在自然和对抗数据集上的实验验证表明，NDM在性能上优于现有SOTA方法，包括SLD、UCE和RECE等。

Conclusion: NDM框架能够有效检测和缓解文本到图像生成中的隐含恶意意图，同时保持模型的原始生成能力，为解决模型偏见和伦理问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Despite the impressive generative capabilities of text-to-image (T2I)
diffusion models, they remain vulnerable to generating inappropriate content,
especially when confronted with implicit sexual prompts. Unlike explicit
harmful prompts, these subtle cues, often disguised as seemingly benign terms,
can unexpectedly trigger sexual content due to underlying model biases, raising
significant ethical concerns. However, existing detection methods are primarily
designed to identify explicit sexual content and therefore struggle to detect
these implicit cues. Fine-tuning approaches, while effective to some extent,
risk degrading the model's generative quality, creating an undesirable
trade-off. To address this, we propose NDM, the first noise-driven detection
and mitigation framework, which could detect and mitigate implicit malicious
intention in T2I generation while preserving the model's original generative
capabilities. Specifically, we introduce two key innovations: first, we
leverage the separability of early-stage predicted noise to develop a
noise-based detection method that could identify malicious content with high
accuracy and efficiency; second, we propose a noise-enhanced adaptive negative
guidance mechanism that could optimize the initial noise by suppressing the
prominent region's attention, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of adaptive
negative guidance for sexual mitigation. Experimentally, we validate NDM on
both natural and adversarial datasets, demonstrating its superior performance
over existing SOTA methods, including SLD, UCE, and RECE, etc. Code and
resources are available at https://github.com/lorraine021/NDM.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当获取精细像素级标注困难或昂贵时，使用粗标注（如边界区域未标注）训练分割模型，但这种方法在优化类间边界对齐方面存在困难

Method: 在编码器-解码器架构中引入基于超像素的上采样正则化，鼓励解码图像中的分割像素符合SLIC超像素（基于颜色和位置，与分割标注无关）

Result: 在SUIM、Cityscapes和PanNuke数据集上评估，相比最先进模型，边界召回率显著提升

Conclusion: 该方法有效改善了在粗标注数据上训练的分割模型的边界对齐性能

Abstract: Semantic segmentation is the task of classifying each pixel in an image.
Training a segmentation model achieves best results using annotated images,
where each pixel is annotated with the corresponding class. When obtaining fine
annotations is difficult or expensive, it may be possible to acquire coarse
annotations, e.g. by roughly annotating pixels in an images leaving some pixels
around the boundaries between classes unlabeled. Segmentation with coarse
annotations is difficult, in particular when the objective is to optimize the
alignment of boundaries between classes. This paper proposes a regularization
method for models with an encoder-decoder architecture with superpixel based
upsampling. It encourages the segmented pixels in the decoded image to be
SLIC-superpixels, which are based on pixel color and position, independent of
the segmentation annotation. The method is applied to FCN-16 fully
convolutional network architecture and evaluated on the SUIM, Cityscapes, and
PanNuke data sets. It is shown that the boundary recall improves significantly
compared to state-of-the-art models when trained on coarse annotations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决潜在扩散模型中高频细节保真度不足和罕见激活峰值问题，提供无需训练或微调的稳定解决方案。

Method: 结合每样本微钳位技术（温和限制极端值）和自适应分位数裁剪（AQClip），AQClip可使用局部结构统计或注意力熵引导模式。

Result: 在CADE 2.5渲染管道中集成QSilk，在低步数和高分辨率下获得更清晰、更锐利的结果，与CFG/Rescale有协同效应。

Conclusion: QSilk为潜在扩散模型提供了一种高效稳定的解决方案，在SD/SDXL骨干网络上均表现一致改进，且计算开销可忽略。

Abstract: We present QSilk, a lightweight, always-on stabilization layer for latent
diffusion that improves high-frequency fidelity while suppressing rare
activation spikes. QSilk combines (i) a per-sample micro clamp that gently
limits extreme values without washing out texture, and (ii) Adaptive Quantile
Clip (AQClip), which adapts the allowed value corridor per region. AQClip can
operate in a proxy mode using local structure statistics or in an attention
entropy guided mode (model confidence). Integrated into the CADE 2.5 rendering
pipeline, QSilk yields cleaner, sharper results at low step counts and
ultra-high resolutions with negligible overhead. It requires no training or
fine-tuning and exposes minimal user controls. We report consistent qualitative
improvements across SD/SDXL backbones and show synergy with CFG/Rescale,
enabling slightly higher guidance without artifacts.

Conclusion: 通过将概念建立在视觉证据基础上，该方法克服了先前模型的基本限制，增强了可解释AI的可靠性

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) enhance interpretability by predicting
human-understandable concepts as intermediate representations. However,
existing CBMs often suffer from input-to-concept mapping bias and limited
controllability, which restricts their practical value, directly damage the
responsibility of strategy from concept-based methods. We propose a lightweight
Disentangled Concept Bottleneck Model (LDCBM) that automatically groups visual
features into semantically meaningful components without region annotation. By
introducing a filter grouping loss and joint concept supervision, our method
improves the alignment between visual patterns and concepts, enabling more
transparent and robust decision-making. Notably, Experiments on three diverse
datasets demonstrate that LDCBM achieves higher concept and class accuracy,
outperforming previous CBMs in both interpretability and classification
performance. By grounding concepts in visual evidence, our method overcomes a
fundamental limitation of prior models and enhances the reliability of
interpretable AI.

Abstract: The scale and quality of datasets are crucial for training robust perception
models. However, obtaining large-scale annotated data is both costly and
time-consuming. Generative models have emerged as a powerful tool for data
augmentation by synthesizing samples that adhere to desired distributions.
However, current generative approaches often rely on complex post-processing or
extensive fine-tuning on massive datasets to achieve satisfactory results, and
they remain prone to content-position mismatches and semantic leakage. To
overcome these limitations, we introduce ReCon, a novel augmentation framework
that enhances the capacity of structure-controllable generative models for
object detection. ReCon integrates region-guided rectification into the
diffusion sampling process, using feedback from a pre-trained perception model
to rectify misgenerated regions within diffusion sampling process. We further
propose region-aligned cross-attention to enforce spatial-semantic alignment
between image regions and their textual cues, thereby improving both semantic
consistency and overall image fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
ReCon substantially improve the quality and trainability of generated data,
achieving consistent performance gains across various datasets, backbone
architectures, and data scales. Our code is available at

Result: 在DeformingThings4D和D-FAUST数据集上优于先前最先进方法，相比先前最佳方法实现了4倍以上的加速。

Conclusion: ERNet能够有效处理噪声和部分输入，利用时序信息实现准确一致的序列配准，在准确性和效率方面都有显著提升。

Abstract: Registering an object shape to a sequence of point clouds undergoing
non-rigid deformation is a long-standing challenge. The key difficulties stem
from two factors: (i) the presence of local minima due to the non-convexity of
registration objectives, especially under noisy or partial inputs, which
hinders accurate and robust deformation estimation, and (ii) error accumulation
over long sequences, leading to tracking failures. To address these challenges,
we introduce to adopt a scalable data-driven approach and propose ERNet, an
efficient feed-forward model trained on large deformation datasets. It is
designed to handle noisy and partial inputs while effectively leveraging
temporal information for accurate and consistent sequential registration. The
key to our design is predicting a sequence of deformation graphs through a
two-stage pipeline, which first estimates frame-wise coarse graph nodes for
robust initialization, before refining their trajectories over time in a
sliding-window fashion. Extensive experiments show that our proposed approach
(i) outperforms previous state-of-the-art on both the DeformingThings4D and
D-FAUST datasets, and (ii) achieves more than 4x speedup compared to the
previous best, offering significant efficiency improvement.

Motivation: 现有文本到视频生成方法严重依赖精确的用户提示，而现有的测试时优化方法难以处理视频的多方面特性，需要一种能够自主改进视频生成的系统。

Method: VISTA采用多代理系统：1）将用户想法分解为结构化时间计划；2）通过成对锦标赛选择最佳视频；3）视觉、音频和上下文保真度三个专业代理进行评审；4）推理代理综合反馈并重写提示进行下一轮生成。

Result: 在单场景和多场景视频生成实验中，VISTA持续改进视频质量和用户意图对齐，相比最先进基线方法获得高达60%的成对胜率，人类评估者在66.4%的比较中更偏好VISTA输出。

Conclusion: VISTA通过迭代自改进机制有效提升了文本到视频生成的质量和用户意图对齐，在多场景视频生成中表现优于现有方法。

Abstract: Despite rapid advances in text-to-video synthesis, generated video quality
remains critically dependent on precise user prompts. Existing test-time
optimization methods, successful in other domains, struggle with the
multi-faceted nature of video. In this work, we introduce VISTA (Video
Iterative Self-improvemenT Agent), a novel multi-agent system that autonomously
improves video generation through refining prompts in an iterative loop. VISTA
first decomposes a user idea into a structured temporal plan. After generation,
the best video is identified through a robust pairwise tournament. This winning
video is then critiqued by a trio of specialized agents focusing on visual,
audio, and contextual fidelity. Finally, a reasoning agent synthesizes this
feedback to introspectively rewrite and enhance the prompt for the next
generation cycle. Experiments on single- and multi-scene video generation
scenarios show that while prior methods yield inconsistent gains, VISTA
consistently improves video quality and alignment with user intent, achieving
up to 60% pairwise win rate against state-of-the-art baselines. Human
evaluators concur, preferring VISTA outputs in 66.4% of comparisons.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于视觉语言模型的方法在理解场景中物体的空间关系方面存在不足，影响了开放词汇语义分割的性能。

Method: 提出RelateSeg方法，自动提取空间关系并将其编码为一阶逻辑公式，通过伪类别同时预测语义类别和空间伪类别，使用模糊逻辑松弛在深度网络中实现端到端学习。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上达到平均mIoU的最先进性能，特别是在包含多个类别的图像上表现优异，仅引入单个辅助损失函数且无额外参数。

Conclusion: 神经符号空间推理在开放词汇语义分割中具有显著效果，RelateSeg验证了空间关系约束的重要性。

Abstract: Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation (OVSS) assigns pixel-level labels from
an open set of categories, requiring generalization to unseen and unlabelled
objects. Using vision-language models (VLMs) to correlate local image patches
with potential unseen object categories suffers from a lack of understanding of
spatial relations of objects in a scene. To solve this problem, we introduce
neuro-symbolic (NeSy) spatial reasoning in OVSS. In contrast to contemporary
VLM correlation-based approaches, we propose Relational Segmentor (RelateSeg)
to impose explicit spatial relational constraints by first order logic (FOL)
formulated in a neural network architecture. This is the first attempt to
explore NeSy spatial reasoning in OVSS. Specifically, RelateSeg automatically
extracts spatial relations, e.g., <cat, to-right-of, person>, and encodes them
as first-order logic formulas using our proposed pseudo categories. Each pixel
learns to predict both a semantic category (e.g., "cat") and a spatial pseudo
category (e.g., "right of person") simultaneously, enforcing relational
constraints (e.g., a "cat" pixel must lie to the right of a "person"). Finally,
these logic constraints are formulated in a deep network architecture by fuzzy
logic relaxation, enabling end-to-end learning of spatial-relationally
consistent segmentation. RelateSeg achieves state-of-the-art performance in
terms of average mIoU across four benchmark datasets and particularly shows
clear advantages on images containing multiple categories, with the cost of
only introducing a single auxiliary loss function and no additional parameters,

TL;DR: 3DPR是一种基于图像的重新照明模型，利用从光舞台捕获的多视图单光源图像学习的生成先验，实现单张肖像照片的高质量环境光重新照明。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图形学方法通过可微分渲染将输入图像分解为几何、材质和光照，但受到底层模型和参数化假设的限制。需要一种能更好捕捉高频面部反射的方法。

Method: 使用预训练生成头部模型的潜在空间作为几何先验，通过编码器反演将输入肖像嵌入该流形。然后使用基于三元平面的反射网络合成高质量单光源图像，实现基于图像的重新照明。

Result: 3DPR在保持身份特征和捕捉光照效果（如镜面反射、自阴影和次表面散射）方面优于先前方法，产生物理准确的环境光重新照明结果。

Conclusion: 该方法通过结合生成几何先验和光舞台训练的反射网络，成功解决了单张肖像重新照明的欠约束问题，实现了高质量的图像重照明效果。

Abstract: Rendering novel, relit views of a human head, given a monocular portrait
image as input, is an inherently underconstrained problem. The traditional
graphics solution is to explicitly decompose the input image into geometry,
material and lighting via differentiable rendering; but this is constrained by
the multiple assumptions and approximations of the underlying models and
parameterizations of these scene components. We propose 3DPR, an image-based
relighting model that leverages generative priors learnt from multi-view
One-Light-at-A-Time (OLAT) images captured in a light stage. We introduce a new
diverse and large-scale multi-view 4K OLAT dataset of 139 subjects to learn a
high-quality prior over the distribution of high-frequency face reflectance. We
leverage the latent space of a pre-trained generative head model that provides
a rich prior over face geometry learnt from in-the-wild image datasets. The
input portrait is first embedded in the latent manifold of such a model through
an encoder-based inversion process. Then a novel triplane-based reflectance
network trained on our lightstage data is used to synthesize high-fidelity OLAT
images to enable image-based relighting. Our reflectance network operates in
the latent space of the generative head model, crucially enabling a relatively
small number of lightstage images to train the reflectance model. Combining the
generated OLATs according to a given HDRI environment maps yields physically
accurate environmental relighting results. Through quantitative and qualitative
evaluations, we demonstrate that 3DPR outperforms previous methods,
particularly in preserving identity and in capturing lighting effects such as
specularities, self-shadows, and subsurface scattering. Project Page:

TL;DR: Memory-SAM是一种无需训练、无需人工提示的舌象分割方法，通过检索历史案例的DINOv3特征自动生成提示，引导SAM2实现高效分割。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统监督模型需要大量标注数据，SAM系列模型仍需人工提示。本文旨在开发无需训练和人工干预的自动舌象分割方法。

Method: 使用DINOv3特征和FAISS检索构建小型记忆库，通过掩码约束对应关系提取前景/背景点提示，自动引导SAM2进行分割。

Result: 在600张专家标注图像上测试，Memory-SAM达到mIoU 0.9863，显著优于FCN(0.8188)和检测器到框的SAM基线(0.1839)。

Conclusion: 检索到提示的方法能够实现数据高效、鲁棒的舌象不规则边界分割，在真实场景下表现优异。

Abstract: Accurate tongue segmentation is crucial for reliable TCM analysis. Supervised
models require large annotated datasets, while SAM-family models remain
prompt-driven. We present Memory-SAM, a training-free, human-prompt-free
pipeline that automatically generates effective prompts from a small memory of
prior cases via dense DINOv3 features and FAISS retrieval. Given a query image,
mask-constrained correspondences to the retrieved exemplar are distilled into
foreground/background point prompts that guide SAM2 without manual clicks or
model fine-tuning. We evaluate on 600 expert-annotated images (300 controlled,
300 in-the-wild). On the mixed test split, Memory-SAM achieves mIoU 0.9863,
surpassing FCN (0.8188) and a detector-to-box SAM baseline (0.1839). On
controlled data, ceiling effects above 0.98 make small differences less
meaningful given annotation variability, while our method shows clear gains
under real-world conditions. Results indicate that retrieval-to-prompt enables
data-efficient, robust segmentation of irregular boundaries in tongue imaging.

Motivation: 推进原生图像生成的前沿技术，将文本到图像生成和图像编辑统一到单一架构中，解决图像编辑等挑战性任务。

Method: 采用自回归+扩散混合架构：自回归模型首先生成基于多模态输入的离散图像token，其隐藏状态作为扩散模型的调节信号来生成高保真图像。

Result: 在各种文本到图像和图像编辑基准测试中，BLIP3o-NEXT实现了优于现有模型的性能表现。

Conclusion: 架构选择的关键在于可扩展性和快速推理能力；强化学习能推进原生图像生成；数据质量和规模决定模型性能上限；自回归+扩散架构结合了推理能力和细节渲染优势。

Abstract: We present BLIP3o-NEXT, a fully open-source foundation model in the BLIP3
series that advances the next frontier of native image generation. BLIP3o-NEXT
unifies text-to-image generation and image editing within a single
architecture, demonstrating strong image generation and image editing
capabilities. In developing the state-of-the-art native image generation model,
we identify four key insights: (1) Most architectural choices yield comparable
performance; an architecture can be deemed effective provided it scales
efficiently and supports fast inference; (2) The successful application of
reinforcement learning can further push the frontier of native image
generation; (3) Image editing still remains a challenging task, yet instruction
following and the consistency between generated and reference images can be
significantly enhanced through post-training and data engine; (4) Data quality
and scale continue to be decisive factors that determine the upper bound of
model performance. Building upon these insights, BLIP3o-NEXT leverages an
Autoregressive + Diffusion architecture in which an autoregressive model first
generates discrete image tokens conditioned on multimodal inputs, whose hidden
states are then used as conditioning signals for a diffusion model to generate
high-fidelity images. This architecture integrates the reasoning strength and
instruction following of autoregressive models with the fine-detail rendering
ability of diffusion models, achieving a new level of coherence and realism.
Extensive evaluations of various text-to-image and image-editing benchmarks
show that BLIP3o-NEXT achieves superior performance over existing models.

Motivation: 解决生物医学视觉语言模型在临床应用中因提示优化技术产生不可解释的潜在向量或单一文本提示而缺乏透明度的问题，这些限制影响了在高风险医疗环境中的可信度。

Method: 使用进化框架，将大语言模型作为生物医学知识提取器和自适应优化器，自动生成多样化的可解释自然语言提示对。

Result: 在多个生物医学基准测试中，BiomedXPro始终优于最先进的提示调优方法，特别是在数据稀缺的少样本设置中。发现的提示与统计学显著的临床特征之间存在强语义对齐。

Conclusion: 通过生成多样化的可解释提示集合，BiomedXPro为模型预测提供了可验证的基础，是开发更可信和临床对齐AI系统的关键步骤。

Abstract: The clinical adoption of biomedical vision-language models is hindered by
prompt optimization techniques that produce either uninterpretable latent
vectors or single textual prompts. This lack of transparency and failure to
capture the multi-faceted nature of clinical diagnosis, which relies on
integrating diverse observations, limits their trustworthiness in high-stakes
settings. To address this, we introduce BiomedXPro, an evolutionary framework
that leverages a large language model as both a biomedical knowledge extractor
and an adaptive optimizer to automatically generate a diverse ensemble of
interpretable, natural-language prompt pairs for disease diagnosis. Experiments
on multiple biomedical benchmarks show that BiomedXPro consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art prompt-tuning methods, particularly in data-scarce few-shot
settings. Furthermore, our analysis demonstrates a strong semantic alignment
between the discovered prompts and statistically significant clinical features,
grounding the model's performance in verifiable concepts. By producing a
diverse ensemble of interpretable prompts, BiomedXPro provides a verifiable
basis for model predictions, representing a critical step toward the
development of more trustworthy and clinically-aligned AI systems.

Abstract: Synthesizing large-scale, explorable, and geometrically accurate 3D urban
scenes is a challenging yet valuable task in providing immersive and embodied
applications. The challenges lie in the lack of large-scale and high-quality
real-world 3D scans for training generalizable generative models. In this
paper, we take an alternative route to create large-scale 3D scenes by
synergizing the readily available satellite imagery that supplies realistic
coarse geometry and the open-domain diffusion model for creating high-quality
close-up appearances. We propose \textbf{Skyfall-GS}, the first city-block
scale 3D scene creation framework without costly 3D annotations, also featuring
real-time, immersive 3D exploration. We tailor a curriculum-driven iterative
refinement strategy to progressively enhance geometric completeness and
photorealistic textures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Skyfall-GS
provides improved cross-view consistent geometry and more realistic textures
compared to state-of-the-art approaches. Project page:

Conclusion: 多模态在感知和推理中相互增强，OmniVinci在机器人、医疗AI和智能工厂等下游应用中展示了多模态优势。

Abstract: Advancing machine intelligence requires developing the ability to perceive

OmniVinci, an initiative to build a strong, open-source, omni-modal LLM. We
carefully study the design choices across model architecture and data curation.
For model architecture, we present three key innovations: (i) OmniAlignNet for
strengthening alignment between vision and audio embeddings in a shared
omni-modal latent space; (ii) Temporal Embedding Grouping for capturing
relative temporal alignment between vision and audio signals; and (iii)
Constrained Rotary Time Embedding for encoding absolute temporal information in
omni-modal embeddings. We introduce a curation and synthesis pipeline that
generates 24M single-modal and omni-modal conversations. We find that
modalities reinforce one another in both perception and reasoning. Our model,
OmniVinci, outperforms Qwen2.5-Omni with +19.05 on DailyOmni (cross-modal
understanding), +1.7 on MMAR (audio), and +3.9 on Video-MME (vision), while
using just 0.2T training tokens - a 6 times reduction compared to
Qwen2.5-Omni's 1.2T. We finally demonstrate omni-modal advantages in downstream
applications spanning robotics, medical AI, and smart factory.

Motivation: 现有端到端多模态模型使用不同的编码器和解码器处理输入输出信息，这种分离阻碍了多模态的联合表征学习。

Method: 使用基于Mamba的多步选择扩散模型，通过统一的变分自编码器渐进生成和精炼模态特定信息。

Conclusion: MDM有效统一了多模态处理过程，同时保持计算效率，为端到端多模态架构开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Current end-to-end multi-modal models utilize different encoders and decoders
to process input and output information. This separation hinders the joint
representation learning of various modalities. To unify multi-modal processing,
we propose a novel architecture called MDM (Multi-modal Diffusion Mamba). MDM
utilizes a Mamba-based multi-step selection diffusion model to progressively
generate and refine modality-specific information through a unified variational
autoencoder for both encoding and decoding. This innovative approach allows MDM
to achieve superior performance when processing high-dimensional data,
particularly in generating high-resolution images and extended text sequences
simultaneously. Our evaluations in areas such as image generation, image
captioning, visual question answering, text comprehension, and reasoning tasks
demonstrate that MDM significantly outperforms existing end-to-end models
(MonoFormer, LlamaGen, and Chameleon etc.) and competes effectively with SOTA
models like GPT-4V, Gemini Pro, and Mistral. Our results validate MDM's
effectiveness in unifying multi-modal processes while maintaining computational
efficiency, establishing a new direction for end-to-end multi-modal

Abstract: This article presents a fully autonomous aerial masonry construction
framework using heterogeneous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), supported by
experimental validation. Two specialized UAVs were developed for the task: (i)
a brick-carrier UAV equipped with a ball-joint actuation mechanism for precise
brick manipulation, and (ii) an adhesion UAV integrating a servo-controlled
valve and extruder nozzle for accurate adhesion application. The proposed
framework employs a reactive mission planning unit that combines a dependency
graph of the construction layout with a conflict graph to manage simultaneous
task execution, while hierarchical state machines ensure robust operation and
safe transitions during task execution. Dynamic task allocation allows
real-time adaptation to environmental feedback, while minimum-jerk trajectory
generation ensures smooth and precise UAV motion during brick pickup and
placement. Additionally, the brick-carrier UAV employs an onboard vision system
that estimates brick poses in real time using ArUco markers and a least-squares
optimization filter, enabling accurate alignment during construction. To the
best of the authors' knowledge, this work represents the first experimental
demonstration of fully autonomous aerial masonry construction using
heterogeneous UAVs, where one UAV precisely places the bricks while another
autonomously applies adhesion material between them. The experimental results
supported by the video showcase the effectiveness of the proposed framework and
demonstrate its potential to serve as a foundation for future developments in
autonomous aerial robotic construction.

Conclusion: RM-RL框架有效解决了精密操作任务中的演示获取困难和数据效率问题，在真实世界应用中表现出色，为精细操作任务提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Precise robot manipulation is critical for fine-grained applications such as
chemical and biological experiments, where even small errors (e.g., reagent
spillage) can invalidate an entire task. Existing approaches often rely on
pre-collected expert demonstrations and train policies via imitation learning
(IL) or offline reinforcement learning (RL). However, obtaining high-quality
demonstrations for precision tasks is difficult and time-consuming, while
offline RL commonly suffers from distribution shifts and low data efficiency.
We introduce a Role-Model Reinforcement Learning (RM-RL) framework that unifies
online and offline training in real-world environments. The key idea is a
role-model strategy that automatically generates labels for online training
data using approximately optimal actions, eliminating the need for human
demonstrations. RM-RL reformulates policy learning as supervised training,
reducing instability from distribution mismatch and improving efficiency. A
hybrid training scheme further leverages online role-model data for offline
reuse, enhancing data efficiency through repeated sampling. Extensive
experiments show that RM-RL converges faster and more stably than existing RL
methods, yielding significant gains in real-world manipulation: 53% improvement
in translation accuracy and 20% in rotation accuracy. Finally, we demonstrate
the successful execution of a challenging task, precisely placing a cell plate
onto a shelf, highlighting the framework's effectiveness where prior methods
fail.

Abstract: This article presents an extension of the Lagrange-Poincare Equations (LPE)
to model the dynamics of spacecraft-manipulator systems operating within a
non-inertial orbital reference frame. Building upon prior formulations of LPE
for vehicle-manipulator systems, the proposed framework, termed the
Lagrange-Poincare-Kepler Equations (LPKE), incorporates the coupling between
spacecraft attitude dynamics, orbital motion, and manipulator kinematics. The
formalism combines the Euler-Poincare equations for the base spacecraft,
Keplerian orbital dynamics for the reference frame, and reduced Euler-Lagrange
equations for the manipulator's shape space, using an exponential joint
parametrization. Leveraging the Lagrange-d'Alembert principle on principal
bundles, we derive novel closed-form structural matrices that explicitly
capture the effects of orbital disturbances and their dynamic coupling with the
manipulator system. The LPKE framework also systematically includes externally
applied, symmetry-breaking wrenches, allowing for immediate integration into
hardware-in-the-loop simulations and model-based control architectures for
autonomous robotic operations in the orbital environment. To illustrate the
effectiveness of the proposed model and its numerical superiority, we present a
simulation study analyzing orbital effects on a 7-degree-of-freedom manipulator
mounted on a spacecraft.

Abstract: Autonomous navigation for legged robots in complex and dynamic environments
relies on robust simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) systems to
accurately map surroundings and localize the robot, ensuring safe and efficient
operation. While prior sensor fusion-based SLAM approaches have integrated
various sensor modalities to improve their robustness, these algorithms are
still susceptible to estimation drift in challenging environments due to their
reliance on unsuitable fusion strategies. Therefore, we propose a robust
LiDAR-visual-inertial-kinematic odometry system that integrates information
from multiple sensors, such as a camera, LiDAR, inertial measurement unit
(IMU), and joint encoders, for visual and LiDAR-based odometry estimation. Our
system employs a fusion-based pose estimation approach that runs
optimization-based visual-inertial-kinematic odometry (VIKO) and filter-based
LiDAR-inertial-kinematic odometry (LIKO) based on measurement availability. In
VIKO, we utilize the footpreintegration technique and robust LiDAR-visual depth
consistency using superpixel clusters in a sliding window optimization. In
LIKO, we incorporate foot kinematics and employ a point-toplane residual in an
error-state iterative Kalman filter (ESIKF). Compared with other sensor
fusion-based SLAM algorithms, our approach shows robust performance across
public and longterm datasets.

Conclusion: PolyFly通过非保守的多面体建模实现了更高效的空中运输机器人轨迹规划，在复杂约束环境中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Aerial transportation robots using suspended cables have emerged as versatile
platforms for disaster response and rescue operations. To maximize the
capabilities of these systems, robots need to aggressively fly through tightly
constrained environments, such as dense forests and structurally unsafe
buildings, while minimizing flight time and avoiding obstacles. Existing
methods geometrically over-approximate the vehicle and obstacles, leading to
conservative maneuvers and increased flight times. We eliminate these
restrictions by proposing PolyFly, an optimal global planner which considers a
non-conservative representation for aerial transportation by modeling each
physical component of the environment, and the robot (quadrotor, cable and
payload), as independent polytopes. We further increase the model accuracy by
incorporating the attitude of the physical components by constructing
orientation-aware polytopes. The resulting optimal control problem is
efficiently solved by converting the polytope constraints into smooth
differentiable constraints via duality theory. We compare our method against
the existing state-of-the-art approach in eight maze-like environments and show
that PolyFly produces faster trajectories in each scenario. We also
experimentally validate our proposed approach on a real quadrotor with a
suspended payload, demonstrating the practical reliability and accuracy of our
method.

Conclusion: 所提出的数学框架通过考虑风力和无人机异构性等现实因素，增强了基于无人机的灾害响应规划的实际可行性。

Abstract: Natural and human-made disasters can cause severe devastation and claim
thousands of lives worldwide. Therefore, developing efficient methods for
disaster response and management is a critical task for relief teams. One of
the most essential components of effective response is the rapid collection of
information about affected areas, damages, and victims. More data translates
into better coordination, faster rescue operations, and ultimately, more lives
saved. However, in some disasters, such as earthquakes, the communication
infrastructure is often partially or completely destroyed, making it extremely
difficult for victims to send distress signals and for rescue teams to locate
and assist them in time. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have emerged as
valuable tools in such scenarios. In particular, a fleet of UAVs can be
dispatched from a mobile station to the affected area to facilitate data
collection and establish temporary communication networks. Nevertheless,
real-world deployment of UAVs faces several challenges, with adverse weather
conditions--especially wind--being among the most significant. To address this,
we develop a novel mathematical framework to determine the optimal location of
a mobile UAV station while explicitly accounting for the heterogeneity of the
UAVs and the effect of wind. In particular, we generalize the Sylvester problem
to introduce the Sylvester-Fermat-Torricelli (SFT) problem, which captures
complex factors such as wind influence, UAV heterogeneity, and back-and-forth
motion within a unified framework. The proposed framework enhances the
practicality of UAV-based disaster response planning by accounting for
real-world factors such as wind and UAV heterogeneity. Experimental results
demonstrate that it can reduce wasted operational time by up to 84%, making
post-disaster missions significantly more efficient and effective.

Motivation: 现有实时方法在分割空间特征时，由于传感器视场限制和视角变化，难以一致识别房间，常出现过度分割或分割不足的问题，导致位姿图优化中出现错误约束。

Method: 提出可通行性感知的房间分割方法，考虑机器人与周围环境的交互，确保可通行性信息的一致可行性。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了场景图在3D建图中的语义一致性和计算效率，改善了位姿图优化的性能。

Abstract: Scene graphs enhance 3D mapping capabilities in robotics by understanding the
relationships between different spatial elements, such as rooms and objects.
Recent research extends scene graphs to hierarchical layers, adding and
leveraging constraints across these levels. This approach is tightly integrated
with pose-graph optimization, improving both localization and mapping accuracy
simultaneously. However, when segmenting spatial characteristics, consistently
recognizing rooms becomes challenging due to variations in viewpoints and
limited field of view (FOV) of sensors. For example, existing real-time
approaches often over-segment large rooms into smaller, non-functional spaces
that are not useful for localization and mapping due to the time-dependent
method. Conversely, their voxel-based room segmentation method often
under-segment in complex cases like not fully enclosed 3D space that are
non-traversable for ground robots or humans, leading to false constraints in
pose-graph optimization. We propose a traversability-aware room segmentation
method that considers the interaction between robots and surroundings, with
consistent feasibility of traversability information. This enhances both the
semantic coherence and computational efficiency of pose-graph optimization.
Improved performance is demonstrated through the re-detection frequency of the
same rooms in a dataset involving repeated traversals of the same space along
the same path, as well as the optimization time consumption.

Conclusion: ASBI框架能够有效解决黑盒仿真器参数估计问题，通过主动数据收集实现准确的参数校准。

Abstract: Black-box simulators are widely used in robotics, but optimizing their
parameters remains challenging due to inaccessible likelihoods.
Simulation-Based Inference (SBI) tackles this issue using simulation-driven
approaches, estimating the posterior from offline real observations and forward
simulations. However, in black-box scenarios, preparing observations that
contain sufficient information for parameter estimation is difficult due to the
unknown relationship between parameters and observations. In this work, we
present Active Simulation-Based Inference (ASBI), a parameter estimation
framework that uses robots to actively collect real-world online data to
achieve accurate black-box simulator tuning. Our framework optimizes robot
actions to collect informative observations by maximizing information gain,
which is defined as the expected reduction in Shannon entropy between the
posterior and the prior. While calculating information gain requires the
likelihood, which is inaccessible in black-box simulators, our method solves
this problem by leveraging Neural Posterior Estimation (NPE), which leverages a
neural network to learn the posterior estimator. Three simulation experiments
quantitatively verify that our method achieves accurate parameter estimation,
with posteriors sharply concentrated around the true parameters. Moreover, we
show a practical application using a real robot to estimate the simulation
parameters of cubic particles corresponding to two real objects, beads and
gravel, with a bucket pouring action.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在灾难响应和非结构化室内环境中，机器人不仅需要避开障碍物，还需要识别哪些障碍物可以被推开。现有导航系统缺乏这种交互感知能力，导致机器人容易被卡住。

Method: 开发了可移动障碍物层，将静态地图中不存在的LiDAR返回标记为暂定可移动并分配较低穿越成本。配合慢姿态进度检查器监控速度比，当机器人减速时提高局部成本，促使全局规划器重新规划路径。

Result: 在Gazebo中对Scout Mini的评估显示，相比无层基线，该方法具有更高的目标到达率和更少的死锁，穿越时间大致相当。

Conclusion: 交互感知成本地图是轻量级的ROS2原生扩展，适合在非结构化环境中导航可移动障碍物，特别适用于资源受限的搜救机器人。

Abstract: Reliable navigation in disaster-response and other unstructured indoor
settings requires robots not only to avoid obstacles but also to recognise when
those obstacles can be pushed aside. We present an adaptive, LiDAR and
odometry-based path-planning framework that embeds this capability into the
ROS2 Nav2 stack. A new Movable Obstacles Layer labels all LiDAR returns missing
from a prior static map as tentatively movable and assigns a reduced traversal
cost. A companion Slow-Pose Progress Checker monitors the ratio of commanded to
actual velocity; when the robot slows appreciably, the local cost is raised
from light to heavy, and on a stall to lethal, prompting the global planner to
back out and re-route. Gazebo evaluations on a Scout Mini, spanning isolated
objects and cluttered corridors, show higher goal-reach rates and fewer
deadlocks than a no-layer baseline, with traversal times broadly comparable.
Because the method relies only on planar scans and CPU-level computation, it
suits resource-constrained search and rescue robots and integrates into
heterogeneous platforms with minimal engineering. Overall, the results indicate
that interaction-aware cost maps are a lightweight, ROS2-native extension for
navigating among potentially movable obstacles in unstructured settings. The
full implementation will be released as open source

nature-inspired swarm optimisation algorithm that combines current-aware drift,
irreversible settlement in persistent sensing nodes, and colony-based

addresses the critical limitations of existing swarm algorithms by providing
hydrodynamic awareness, irreversible anchoring mechanisms, and colony-based
communication capabilities essential for underwater exploration missions. The
algorithm establishes a comprehensive foundation for scalable and
energy-efficient underwater swarm robotics with validated performance analysis.
Validation studies demonstrate an 86% success rate for permanent anchoring
scenarios, providing a unified formulation for hydrodynamic constraints and
irreversible settlement behaviours with an empirical study under flow.

Conclusion: 力反馈对于安全有效的多材质切割至关重要，首次展示了学习策略在真实鸡肩去骨中的应用。

Abstract: Automating chicken shoulder deboning requires precise 6-DoF cutting through a
partially occluded, deformable, multi-material joint, since contact with the
bones presents serious health and safety risks. Our work makes both
systems-level and algorithmic contributions to train and deploy a reactive
force-feedback cutting policy that dynamically adapts a nominal trajectory and
enables full 6-DoF knife control to traverse the narrow joint gap while
avoiding contact with the bones. First, we introduce an open-source
custom-built simulator for multi-material cutting that models coupling,
fracture, and cutting forces, and supports reinforcement learning, enabling
efficient training and rapid prototyping. Second, we design a reusable physical
testbed to emulate the chicken shoulder: two rigid "bone" spheres with
controllable pose embedded in a softer block, enabling rigorous and repeatable
evaluation while preserving essential multi-material characteristics of the
target problem. Third, we train and deploy a residual RL policy, with
discretized force observations and domain randomization, enabling robust
zero-shot sim-to-real transfer and the first demonstration of a learned policy
that debones a real chicken shoulder. Our experiments in our simulator, on our
physical testbed, and on real chicken shoulders show that our learned policy
reliably navigates the joint gap and reduces undesired bone/cartilage contact,
resulting in up to a 4x improvement over existing open-loop cutting baselines
in terms of success rate and bone avoidance. Our results also illustrate the
necessity of force feedback for safe and effective multi-material cutting. The

Abstract: In autonomous driving, dynamic environment and corner cases pose significant
challenges to the robustness of ego vehicle's state understanding and decision
making. We introduce VDRive, a novel pipeline for end-to-end autonomous driving
that explicitly models state-action mapping to address these challenges,
enabling interpretable and robust decision making. By leveraging the
advancement of the state understanding of the Vision Language Action Model
(VLA) with generative diffusion policy-based action head, our VDRive guides the
driving contextually and geometrically. Contextually, VLA predicts future
observations through token generation pre-training, where the observations are
represented as discrete codes by a Conditional Vector Quantized Variational
Autoencoder (CVQ-VAE). Geometrically, we perform reinforcement learning
fine-tuning of the VLA to predict future trajectories and actions based on
current driving conditions. VLA supplies the current state tokens and predicted
state tokens for the action policy head to generate hierarchical actions and
trajectories. During policy training, a learned critic evaluates the actions
generated by the policy and provides gradient-based feedback, forming an
actor-critic framework that enables a reinforcement-based policy learning
pipeline. Experiments show that our VDRive achieves state-of-the-art
performance in the Bench2Drive closed-loop benchmark and nuScenes open-loop
planning.

Conclusion: 预测在集成规划中作用有限，规划性能的关键在于高质量提案生成。提案中心方法在复杂场景中表现优异，为自动驾驶规划提供了新方向。

Abstract: Traditionally, prediction and planning in autonomous driving (AD) have been
treated as separate, sequential modules. Recently, there has been a growing
shift towards tighter integration of these components, known as Integrated
Prediction and Planning (IPP), with the aim of enabling more informed and
adaptive decision-making. However, it remains unclear to what extent this
integration actually improves planning performance. In this work, we
investigate the role of prediction in IPP approaches, drawing on the widely
adopted Val14 benchmark, which encompasses more common driving scenarios with
relatively low interaction complexity, and the interPlan benchmark, which
includes highly interactive and out-of-distribution driving situations. Our
analysis reveals that even access to perfect future predictions does not lead
to better planning outcomes, indicating that current IPP methods often fail to
fully exploit future behavior information. Instead, we focus on high-quality
proposal generation, while using predictions primarily for collision checks. We
find that many imitation learning-based planners struggle to generate realistic
and plausible proposals, performing worse than PDM - a simple lane-following
approach. Motivated by this observation, we build on PDM with an enhanced
proposal generation method, shifting the emphasis towards producing diverse but
realistic and high-quality proposals. This proposal-centric approach
significantly outperforms existing methods, especially in out-of-distribution
and highly interactive settings, where it sets new state-of-the-art results.

Abstract: In the context of imitation learning, visuomotor-based diffusion policy
learning is one of the main directions in robotic manipulation. Most of these
approaches rely on point clouds as observation inputs and construct scene
representations through point clouds feature learning, which enables them to
achieve remarkable accuracy. However, the existing literature lacks an in-depth
exploration of vision-only solutions that have significant potential. In this
paper, we propose a Vision-Only and single-view Diffusion Policy learning
method (VO-DP) that leverages pretrained visual foundation models to achieve
effective fusion of semantic and geometric features. We utilize intermediate
features from VGGT incorporating semantic features from DINOv2 and geometric
features from Alternating Attention blocks. Features are fused via
cross-attention and spatially compressed with a CNN to form the input to the
policy head. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VO-DP not only outperforms
the vision-only baseline DP significantly but also exhibits distinct
performance trends against the point cloud-based method DP3: in simulation
tasks, VO-DP achieves an average success rate of 64.6% on par with DP3 64.0%
and far higher than DP 34.8%, while in real-world tasks, it reaches 87.9%,
outperforming both DP3 67.5% and DP 11.2% by a notable margin. Further
robustness evaluations confirm that VO-DP remains highly stable under varying
conditions including color, size, background, and lighting. Lastly, we
open-source a training library for robotic manipulation. Built on Accelerate,
this library supports multi-machine and multi-GPU parallel training, as well as
mixed precision training. It is compatible with visuomotor policies such as DP,
DP3 and VO-DP, and also supports the RoboTwin simulator.

Conclusion: 所提出的方法在时变交互力场景下表现出优越性，有效改善了扰动估计和跟踪精度。

Abstract: The nominal performance of mechanical systems is often degraded by unknown
disturbances. A two-degree-of-freedom control structure can decouple nominal
performance from disturbance rejection. However, perfect disturbance rejection
is unattainable when the disturbance dynamic is unknown. In this work, we
reveal an inherent trade-off in disturbance estimation subject to tracking
speed and tracking uncertainty. Then, we propose two novel methods to enhance
disturbance estimation: an interacting multiple model extended Kalman
filter-based disturbance observer and a multi-kernel correntropy extended
Kalman filter-based disturbance observer. Experiments on an exoskeleton verify
that the proposed two methods improve the tracking accuracy $36.3\%$ and
$16.2\%$ in hip joint error, and $46.3\%$ and $24.4\%$ in knee joint error,
respectively, compared to the extended Kalman filter-based disturbance
observer, in a time-varying interaction force scenario, demonstrating the
superiority of the proposed method.

Abstract: We provide an algorithm for adaptive legged locomotion via online learning
and model predictive control. The algorithm is composed of two interacting
modules: model predictive control (MPC) and online learning of residual
dynamics. The residual dynamics can represent modeling errors and external
disturbances. We are motivated by the future of autonomy where quadrupeds will
autonomously perform complex tasks despite real-world unknown uncertainty, such
as unknown payload and uneven terrains. The algorithm uses random Fourier
features to approximate the residual dynamics in reproducing kernel Hilbert
spaces. Then, it employs MPC based on the current learned model of the residual
dynamics. The model is updated online in a self-supervised manner using least
squares based on the data collected while controlling the quadruped. The
algorithm enjoys sublinear \textit{dynamic regret}, defined as the
suboptimality against an optimal clairvoyant controller that knows how the
residual dynamics. We validate our algorithm in Gazebo and MuJoCo simulations,
where the quadruped aims to track reference trajectories. The Gazebo
simulations include constant unknown external forces up to $12\boldsymbol{g}$,
where $\boldsymbol{g}$ is the gravity vector, in flat terrain, slope terrain
with $20\degree$ inclination, and rough terrain with $0.25m$ height variation.
The MuJoCo simulations include time-varying unknown disturbances with payload
up to $8~kg$ and time-varying ground friction coefficients in flat terrain.

Abstract: This paper introduces an anthropomorphic robot hand built entirely using LEGO
MINDSTORMS: the Educational SoftHand-A, a tendon-driven, highly-underactuated
robot hand based on the Pisa/IIT SoftHand and related hands. To be suitable for
an educational context, the design is constrained to use only standard LEGO
pieces with tests using common equipment available at home. The hand features
dual motors driving an agonist/antagonist opposing pair of tendons on each
finger, which are shown to result in reactive fine control. The finger motions
are synchonized through soft synergies, implemented with a differential
mechanism using clutch gears. Altogether, this design results in an
anthropomorphic hand that can adaptively grasp a broad range of objects using a
simple actuation and control mechanism. Since the hand can be constructed from
LEGO pieces and uses state-of-the-art design concepts for robotic hands, it has
the potential to educate and inspire children to learn about the frontiers of
modern robotics.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统长距离机械臂系统使用刚性或缆绳连接，限制了精度或会将扰动传递给无人机。需要一种能够根据任务需求调整刚度的机制。

Method: 在配备LiCAS双臂机械臂的四旋翼无人机上安装VSL系统，通过遥操作实验评估，包括外部扰动和包裹运输任务。

Result: 改变连杆刚度显著改变了无人机与负载之间的动态交互：柔性配置衰减外部冲击和气动扰动，刚性配置提高操作阶段的定位精度。

Conclusion: VSL增强了系统的多功能性和安全性，提供了可控的柔顺性与精度权衡。未来工作将关注自主刚度调节、多绳配置和协作空中操作。

Abstract: This paper presents the integration of a Variable Stiffness Link (VSL) for
long-reach aerial manipulation, enabling adaptable mechanical coupling between
an aerial multirotor platform and a dual-arm manipulator. Conventional
long-reach manipulation systems rely on rigid or cable connections, which limit
precision or transmit disturbances to the aerial vehicle. The proposed VSL
introduces an adjustable stiffness mechanism that allows the link to behave
either as a flexible rope or as a rigid rod, depending on task requirements.
  The system is mounted on a quadrotor equipped with the LiCAS dual-arm
manipulator and evaluated through teleoperated experiments, involving external
disturbances and parcel transportation tasks. Results demonstrate that varying
the link stiffness significantly modifies the dynamic interaction between the
UAV and the payload. The flexible configuration attenuates external impacts and
aerodynamic perturbations, while the rigid configuration improves positional
accuracy during manipulation phases.
  These results confirm that VSL enhances versatility and safety, providing a
controllable trade-off between compliance and precision. Future work will focus
on autonomous stiffness regulation, multi-rope configurations, cooperative
aerial manipulation and user studies to further assess its impact on
teleoperated and semi-autonomous aerial tasks.

Motivation: 传统3D超声成像依赖昂贵的跟踪系统，而基于神经网络的方法容易受图像噪声和误差累积影响，需要一种成本效益高且精确的解决方案。

Method: 使用轻量级相机捕捉视觉反馈，引入图像恢复方法处理遮挡问题，采用仿真循环方法进行位姿估计，并通过视觉伺服控制器优化图像对齐。

Conclusion: 该方法能够实现可靠的手持式3D超声重建，具有临床应用潜力。

Abstract: Freehand 3D ultrasound (US) imaging using conventional 2D probes offers
flexibility and accessibility for diverse clinical applications but faces
challenges in accurate probe pose estimation. Traditional methods depend on
costly tracking systems, while neural network-based methods struggle with image
noise and error accumulation, compromising reconstruction precision. We propose
a cost-effective and versatile solution that leverages lightweight cameras and
visual servoing in simulated environments for precise 3D US imaging. These
cameras capture visual feedback from a textured planar workspace. To counter
occlusions and lighting issues, we introduce an image restoration method that
reconstructs occluded regions by matching surrounding texture patterns. For
pose estimation, we develop a simulation-in-the-loop approach, which replicates
the system setup in simulation and iteratively minimizes pose errors between
simulated and real-world observations. A visual servoing controller refines the
alignment of camera views, improving translational estimation by optimizing
image alignment. Validations on a soft vascular phantom, a 3D-printed conical
model, and a human arm demonstrate the robustness and accuracy of our approach,
with Hausdorff distances to the reference reconstructions of 0.359 mm, 1.171
mm, and 0.858 mm, respectively. These results confirm the method's potential
for reliable freehand 3D US reconstruction.

Method: 采用基于注意力机制的强化学习，构建层次化图表示，设计新颖的基于社区的全局图构建和更新算法，并引入无参数特权奖励机制。

Result: 在模拟的大规模探索场景中，HEADER比现有学习方法和非学习方法具有更好的可扩展性，探索效率比最先进基线提高了20%。在真实校园环境（300m*230m）中也成功验证。

Conclusion: HEADER通过层次化图表示、注意力机制和无参数奖励设计，实现了在大规模环境中高效且可扩展的自主探索。

Abstract: This work pushes the boundaries of learning-based methods in autonomous robot
exploration in terms of environmental scale and exploration efficiency. We
present HEADER, an attention-based reinforcement learning approach with
hierarchical graphs for efficient exploration in large-scale environments.
HEADER follows existing conventional methods to construct hierarchical
representations for the robot belief/map, but further designs a novel
community-based algorithm to construct and update a global graph, which remains
fully incremental, shape-adaptive, and operates with linear complexity.
Building upon attention-based networks, our planner finely reasons about the
nearby belief within the local range while coarsely leveraging distant
information at the global scale, enabling next-best-viewpoint decisions that
consider multi-scale spatial dependencies. Beyond novel map representation, we
introduce a parameter-free privileged reward that significantly improves model
performance and produces near-optimal exploration behaviors, by avoiding
training objective bias caused by handcrafted reward shaping. In simulated
challenging, large-scale exploration scenarios, HEADER demonstrates better
scalability than most existing learning and non-learning methods, while
achieving a significant improvement in exploration efficiency (up to 20%) over
state-of-the-art baselines. We also deploy HEADER on hardware and validate it
in complex, large-scale real-life scenarios, including a 300m*230m campus
environment.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel few-shot learning framework for multi-robot
systems that integrate both spatial and temporal elements: Few-Shot
Demonstration-Driven Task Coordination and Trajectory Execution (DDACE). Our
approach leverages temporal graph networks for learning task-agnostic temporal
sequencing and Gaussian Processes for spatial trajectory modeling, ensuring
modularity and generalization across various tasks. By decoupling temporal and
spatial aspects, DDACE requires only a small number of demonstrations,
significantly reducing data requirements compared to traditional learning from
demonstration approaches. To validate our proposed framework, we conducted
extensive experiments in task environments designed to assess various aspects
of multi-robot coordination-such as multi-sequence execution, multi-action
dynamics, complex trajectory generation, and heterogeneous configurations. The
experimental results demonstrate that our approach successfully achieves task
execution under few-shot learning conditions and generalizes effectively across
dynamic and diverse settings. This work underscores the potential of modular
architectures in enhancing the practicality and scalability of multi-robot
systems in real-world applications. Additional materials are available at

Motivation: 可持续能源发展增加了电力负荷的不确定性，输电系统运营商需要更高空间分辨率的负荷预测，从区域聚合扩展到单个节点，但节点负荷预测准确性较低且管理困难。

Method: 设计多级预测系统，使用可解释和可扩展的预测模型，评估解决节点负荷异质性和波动性的方案，采用完全并行化的单模型预测工作流。

Conclusion: 多级预测系统使操作员能够更自信和准确地调整负荷预测，精确诊断预测错误，有效应对可持续能源发展带来的电网可靠性挑战。

Abstract: The reliability of local power grid infrastructure is challenged by
sustainable energy developments increasing electric load uncertainty.
Transmission System Operators (TSOs) need load forecasts of higher spatial
resolution, extending current forecasting operations from zonal aggregates to
individual nodes. However, nodal loads are less accurate to forecast and
require a large number of individual forecasts, which are hard to manage for
the human experts assessing risks in the control room's daily operations
(operator). In collaboration with a TSO, we design a multi-level system that
meets the needs of operators for hourly day-ahead load forecasting. Utilizing a
uniquely extensive dataset of zonal and nodal net loads, we experimentally
evaluate our system components. First, we develop an interpretable and scalable
forecasting model that allows for TSOs to gradually extend zonal operations to
include nodal forecasts. Second, we evaluate solutions to address the
heterogeneity and volatility of nodal load, subject to a trade-off. Third, our
system is manageable with a fully parallelized single-model forecasting
workflow. Our results show accuracy and interpretability improvements for zonal
forecasts, and substantial improvements for nodal forecasts. In practice, our
multi-level forecasting system allows operators to adjust forecasts with
unprecedented confidence and accuracy, and to diagnose otherwise opaque errors
precisely.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统特征选择方法主要关注预测准确性，但在存在相关预测因子的情况下性能会下降，需要一种能够处理相关特征空间的方法。

Method: TangledFeatures框架识别相关特征组中的代表性特征，减少冗余同时保持解释能力，所选特征可直接应用于下游模型。

Result: 在Alanine Dipeptide数据集上的实验表明，所选特征对应于结构上有意义的原子间距离，能够解释这些角度的变化。

Conclusion: TangledFeatures提供了比传统选择技术更可解释和稳定的分析基础，在相关特征空间中表现有效。

Abstract: Feature selection is a fundamental step in model development, shaping both
predictive performance and interpretability. Yet, most widely used methods
focus on predictive accuracy, and their performance degrades in the presence of
correlated predictors. To address this gap, we introduce TangledFeatures, a
framework for feature selection in correlated feature spaces. It identifies
representative features from groups of entangled predictors, reducing
redundancy while retaining explanatory power. The resulting feature subset can
be directly applied in downstream models, offering a more interpretable and
stable basis for analysis compared to traditional selection techniques. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of TangledFeatures on Alanine Dipeptide, applying
it to the prediction of backbone torsional angles and show that the selected
features correspond to structurally meaningful intra-atomic distances that
explain variation in these angles.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种改进的C51分布强化学习算法ES-C51，用Expected Sarsa更新替代贪婪Q学习更新，通过softmax结合所有动作信息来提高稳定性，在多个环境中表现优于原始C51。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统C51算法使用贪婪Q学习更新，当多个动作具有相似期望奖励但不同分布时，会导致分布学习不稳定。需要一种更稳定的更新方法来处理这种情况。

Method: 提出ES-C51算法，将C51的贪婪Bellman更新替换为Expected Sarsa更新，使用softmax计算结合所有可能动作的信息，而非仅依赖单一最优动作。

Result: 在Gym经典控制环境和Atari-10游戏中评估，ES-C51在多数环境中表现优于使用softmax探索的QL-C51（改进版C51）。

Conclusion: 使用Expected Sarsa更新的ES-C51算法能够更稳定地学习奖励分布，在处理具有相似期望奖励但不同分布的动作时表现更好，实现了更高性能的策略。

Abstract: In most value-based reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, the agent
estimates only the expected reward for each action and selects the action with
the highest reward. In contrast, Distributional Reinforcement Learning (DRL)
estimates the entire probability distribution of possible rewards, providing
richer information about uncertainty and variability. C51 is a popular DRL
algorithm for discrete action spaces. It uses a Q-learning approach, where the
distribution is learned using a greedy Bellman update. However, this can cause
problems if multiple actions at a state have similar expected reward but with
different distributions, as the algorithm may not learn a stable distribution.
This study presents a modified version of C51 (ES-C51) that replaces the greedy
Q-learning update with an Expected Sarsa update, which uses a softmax
calculation to combine information from all possible actions at a state rather
than relying on a single best action. This reduces instability when actions
have similar expected rewards and allows the agent to learn higher-performing
policies. This approach is evaluated on classic control environments from Gym,
and Atari-10 games. For a fair comparison, we modify the standard C51's
exploration strategy from e-greedy to softmax, which we refer to as QL-C51 (Q-
Learning based C51). The results demonstrate that ES-C51 outperforms QL-C51
across many environments.

Abstract: Wind turbine reliability is critical to the growing renewable energy sector,
where early fault detection significantly reduces downtime and maintenance
costs. This paper introduces a novel ensemble-based deep learning framework for
unsupervised anomaly detection in wind turbines. The method integrates
Variational Autoencoders (VAE), LSTM Autoencoders, and Transformer
architectures, each capturing different temporal and contextual patterns from
high-dimensional SCADA data. A unique feature engineering pipeline extracts
temporal, statistical, and frequency-domain indicators, which are then
processed by the deep models. Ensemble scoring combines model predictions,
followed by adaptive thresholding to detect operational anomalies without
requiring labeled fault data. Evaluated on the CARE dataset containing 89 years
of real-world turbine data across three wind farms, the proposed method
achieves an AUC-ROC of 0.947 and early fault detection up to 48 hours prior to
failure. This approach offers significant societal value by enabling predictive
maintenance, reducing turbine failures, and enhancing operational efficiency in
large-scale wind energy deployments.

Conclusion: AlignFlow通过半离散最优传输实现了噪声与数据的显式最优对齐，提高了流式生成模型的训练效率和性能，具有良好的可扩展性。

Abstract: Flow-based Generative Models (FGMs) effectively transform noise into complex
data distributions. Incorporating Optimal Transport (OT) to couple noise and
data during FGM training has been shown to improve the straightness of flow
trajectories, enabling more effective inference. However, existing OT-based
methods estimate the OT plan using (mini-)batches of sampled noise and data
points, which limits their scalability to large and high-dimensional datasets
in FGMs. This paper introduces AlignFlow, a novel approach that leverages
Semi-Discrete Optimal Transport (SDOT) to enhance the training of FGMs by
establishing an explicit, optimal alignment between noise distribution and data
points with guaranteed convergence. SDOT computes a transport map by
partitioning the noise space into Laguerre cells, each mapped to a
corresponding data point. During FGM training, i.i.d. noise samples are paired
with data points via the SDOT map. AlignFlow scales well to large datasets and
model architectures with negligible computational overhead. Experimental
results show that AlignFlow improves the performance of a wide range of
state-of-the-art FGM algorithms and can be integrated as a plug-and-play
component. Code is available at: https://github.com/konglk1203/AlignFlow.

Abstract: Credit scoring is a high-stakes task in financial services, where model
decisions directly impact individuals' access to credit and are subject to
strict regulatory scrutiny. While Quantum Machine Learning (QML) offers new
computational capabilities, its black-box nature poses challenges for adoption
in domains that demand transparency and trust. In this work, we present
IQNN-CS, an interpretable quantum neural network framework designed for
multiclass credit risk classification. The architecture combines a variational
QNN with a suite of post-hoc explanation techniques tailored for structured
data. To address the lack of structured interpretability in QML, we introduce
Inter-Class Attribution Alignment (ICAA), a novel metric that quantifies
attribution divergence across predicted classes, revealing how the model
distinguishes between credit risk categories. Evaluated on two real-world
credit datasets, IQNN-CS demonstrates stable training dynamics, competitive
predictive performance, and enhanced interpretability. Our results highlight a
practical path toward transparent and accountable QML models for financial
decision-making.

TL;DR: SPA框架通过自监督微调学习世界模型，然后用于策略优化，显著提升LLM智能体在分布外环境中的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型智能体在分布外场景中表现不佳，难以将内部知识与环境动态对齐，导致探索脆弱和泛化能力有限

Method: 将世界模型分解为状态表示和转移建模，通过自博弈监督微调阶段冷启动策略，学习世界模型后用于模拟未来状态进行策略优化

Result: 在Sokoban、FrozenLake和Sudoku等环境中显著提升性能，Sokoban成功率从25.6%提升至59.8%，FrozenLake得分从22.1%提升至70.9%

Conclusion: 为LLM智能体配备内部世界模型可以更好地对齐推理与环境动态，提高决策能力，SPA框架有效提升了强化学习训练性能

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) as agents often struggle in out-of-distribution
(OOD) scenarios. Real-world environments are complex and dynamic, governed by
task-specific rules and stochasticity, which makes it difficult for LLMs to
ground their internal knowledge in those dynamics. Under such OOD conditions,
vanilla RL training often fails to scale; we observe Pass@k--the probability
that at least one of (k) sampled trajectories succeeds--drops markedly across
training steps, indicating brittle exploration and limited generalization.
Inspired by model-based reinforcement learning, we hypothesize that equipping
LLM agents with an internal world model can better align reasoning with
environmental dynamics and improve decision-making. We show how to encode this
world model by decomposing it into two components: state representation and
transition modeling. Building on this, we introduce SPA, a simple reinforcement
learning framework that cold-starts the policy via a Self-Play supervised
finetuning (SFT) stage to learn the world model by interacting with the
environment, then uses it to simulate future states prior to policy
optimization. This simple initialization outperforms the online world-modeling
baseline and greatly boosts the RL-based agent training performance.
Experiments across diverse environments like Sokoban, FrozenLake, and Sudoku
show that our approach significantly improves performance. For example, SPA
boosts the Sokoban success rate from 25.6% to 59.8% and raises the FrozenLake
score from 22.1% to 70.9% for the Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct model.

Motivation: 传统强化学习假设环境固定不变，但实际智能体可能具有主动修改环境模型的能力。通过重新配置底层转移过程，智能体可以增加其长期奖励。

Method: 引入MCTVMDP框架，包含上层MDP用于配置模型改变动作，下层MDP具有可配置的非平稳转移函数。智能体需要联合优化上层配置策略和下层原始动作策略。

Result: 建立了能够处理主动环境修改的强化学习框架，为智能体提供了同时优化环境配置和行为策略的理论基础。

Conclusion: MCTVMDP扩展了传统RL框架，使智能体能够主动修改环境动态，这为更灵活的智能系统设计提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning usually assumes a given or sometimes even fixed
environment in which an agent seeks an optimal policy to maximize its long-term
discounted reward. In contrast, we consider agents that are not limited to
passive adaptations: they instead have model-changing actions that actively
modify the RL model of world dynamics itself. Reconfiguring the underlying
transition processes can potentially increase the agents' rewards. Motivated by
this setting, we introduce the multi-layer configurable time-varying Markov
decision process (MCTVMDP). In an MCTVMDP, the lower-level MDP has a
non-stationary transition function that is configurable through upper-level
model-changing actions. The agent's objective consists of two parts: Optimize
the configuration policies in the upper-level MDP and optimize the primitive
action policies in the lower-level MDP to jointly improve its expected
long-term reward.

providing tools to both detect and eliminate these overused patterns. Our
approach combines three innovations: (1) The Antislop Sampler, which uses
backtracking to suppress unwanted strings at inference time without destroying
vocabulary; (2) An automated pipeline that profiles model-specific slop against
human baselines and generates training data; (3) Final Token Preference
Optimization (FTPO), a novel fine-tuning method that operates on individual
tokens, surgically adjusting logits wherever a banned pattern has appeared in
an inference trace. We demonstrate that some slop patterns appear over
1,000$\times$ more frequently in LLM output than human text. The Antislop
Sampler successfully suppresses 8,000+ patterns while maintaining quality,
whereas token banning becomes unusable at just 2,000. Most importantly, FTPO
achieves 90\% slop reduction while maintaining or improving performance in
cross-domain evals including GSM8K, MMLU, and creative writing tasks. In
contrast, DPO suffers significant degradation in writing quality and lexical
diversity despite achieving weaker suppression. We release all code and results

TL;DR: 本文提出了三种基于物理信息数据驱动模型的双光子光刻系统健康监测方法，能够准确及时地监控机器健康状况，避免过早或不必要的维护。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前双光子光刻系统的维护主要依赖经验而非基于机器健康状况的智能监控，导致维护时机不当，要么造成机器停机和低质量制造，要么进行不必要的维护导致效率低下。

Method: 通过整合物理信息数据驱动的结构尺寸预测模型与统计方法，提出了三种能够处理不同泛化性水平复杂场景的健康监测方法。

Conclusion: 这些结果代表了向双光子光刻系统基于状态的维护迈出的重要一步。

Abstract: Two-photon lithography (TPL) is a sophisticated additive manufacturing
technology for creating three-dimensional (3D) micro- and nano-structures.
Maintaining the health of TPL systems is critical for ensuring consistent
fabrication quality. Current maintenance practices often rely on experience
rather than informed monitoring of machine health, resulting in either untimely
maintenance that causes machine downtime and poor-quality fabrication, or
unnecessary maintenance that leads to inefficiencies and avoidable downtime. To
address this gap, this paper presents three methods for accurate and timely
monitoring of TPL machine health. Through integrating physics-informed
data-driven predictive models for structure dimensions with statistical
approaches, the proposed methods are able to handle increasingly complex
scenarios featuring different levels of generalizability. A comprehensive
experimental dataset that encompasses six process parameter combinations and
six structure dimensions under two machine health conditions was collected to
evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches. Across all test
scenarios, the approaches are shown to achieve high accuracies, demonstrating
excellent effectiveness, robustness, and generalizability. These results
represent a significant step toward condition-based maintenance for TPL
systems.

*Sami Davies,Benjamin Moseley,Heather Newman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文首次在在线设置中实现了同时近似所有ℓp范数的相关性聚类，提出了一个在AOS模型中同时O(log⁴n)竞争所有ℓp范数、O(logn)竞争ℓ∞范数、O(1)竞争ℓ1范数的算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离线设置中可以实现同时近似所有ℓp范数的聚类，但能否在在线设置中实现这种强大保证是一个开放问题。同时，标准RO在线模型中ℓ∞范数存在Ω(n¹/³)的竞争比下界，表明需要超越最坏情况的模型。

Method: 提出了在线带样本(AOS)模型中的单一算法，使用一小部分输入作为样本，生成一个同时优化所有ℓp范数的聚类。

Result: 算法在AOS模型中：同时O(log⁴n)竞争所有ℓp范数(高概率)、O(logn)竞争ℓ∞范数(高概率)、O(1)竞争ℓ1范数(期望)。证明了RO模型中ℓ∞范数存在Ω(n¹/³)竞争比下界。

Conclusion: 成功将离线"全范数"保证移植到在线世界，证明了AOS模型的有效性，并提供了近乎紧的竞争比下界。

Abstract: The $\ell_p$-norm objectives for correlation clustering present a fundamental
trade-off between minimizing total disagreements (the $\ell_1$-norm) and
ensuring fairness to individual nodes (the $\ell_\infty$-norm). Surprisingly,
in the offline setting it is possible to simultaneously approximate all
$\ell_p$-norms with a single clustering. Can this powerful guarantee be
achieved in an online setting? This paper provides the first affirmative
answer. We present a single algorithm for the online-with-a-sample (AOS) model
that, given a small constant fraction of the input as a sample, produces one
clustering that is simultaneously $O(\log^4 n)$-competitive for all
$\ell_p$-norms with high probability, $O(\log n)$-competitive for the
$\ell_\infty$-norm with high probability, and $O(1)$-competitive for the
$\ell_1$-norm in expectation. This work successfully translates the offline
"all-norms" guarantee to the online world.
  Our setting is motivated by a new hardness result that demonstrates a
fundamental separation between these objectives in the standard random-order
(RO) online model. Namely, while the $\ell_1$-norm is trivially
$O(1)$-approximable in the RO model, we prove that any algorithm in the RO
model for the fairness-promoting $\ell_\infty$-norm must have a competitive
ratio of at least $\Omega(n^{1/3})$. This highlights the necessity of a
different beyond-worst-case model. We complement our algorithm with lower
bounds, showing our competitive ratios for the $\ell_1$- and $\ell_\infty$-
norms are nearly tight in the AOS model.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出TempO模型，利用流匹配和稀疏条件处理高维PDE动力学预测，在三个基准数据集上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自回归和扩散方法在预测高维PDE控制动力学时存在累积误差和离散化伪影，限制了长期物理一致性预测。

Method: 使用潜在流匹配模型，结合稀疏条件和通道折叠，通过时间条件傅里叶层高效处理3D时空场，捕捉多尺度模式。

Result: 在三个基准PDE数据集上优于最先进基线，谱分析显示能更好恢复多尺度动力学，参数和内存效率优于基于注意力或卷积的回归器。

Conclusion: TempO通过流匹配和傅里叶层实现了高效、高保真的高维PDE动力学预测，在精度和效率方面均优于现有方法。

Abstract: Forecasting high-dimensional, PDE-governed dynamics remains a core challenge
for generative modeling. Existing autoregressive and diffusion-based approaches
often suffer cumulative errors and discretisation artifacts that limit long,
physically consistent forecasts. Flow matching offers a natural alternative,
enabling efficient, deterministic sampling. We prove an upper bound on FNO
approximation error and propose TempO, a latent flow matching model leveraging
sparse conditioning with channel folding to efficiently process 3D
spatiotemporal fields using time-conditioned Fourier layers to capture
multi-scale modes with high fidelity. TempO outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines across three benchmark PDE datasets, and spectral analysis further
demonstrates superior recovery of multi-scale dynamics, while efficiency
studies highlight its parameter- and memory-light design compared to
attention-based or convolutional regressors.

TL;DR: DLER通过改进强化学习优化，使用简单的截断长度惩罚，在保持准确性的同时大幅缩短推理语言模型的输出长度，实现了最优的准确率-效率权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前推理语言模型虽然性能强大，但生成了不必要的冗长输出，最大化每个token的智能（准确率相对响应长度）仍是一个未解决的问题。

Method: 提出DLER训练配方，结合批次奖励归一化、更高裁剪、动态采样和简单的截断长度惩罚，解决优势估计偏差、熵崩溃和稀疏奖励信号三个关键挑战。

Result: DLER将输出长度减少超过70%，同时超越了所有先前基线的准确率。DLER-7B相比DeepSeek-R1-7B，并行生成多个简洁响应时准确率提高28%且延迟更低。

Conclusion: DLER证明了通过改进RL优化而非复杂惩罚机制，可以实现推理语言模型的准确率-效率最优权衡，并提出了难度感知DLER和更新选择性合并方法以进一步提升效率。

Abstract: Reasoning language models such as OpenAI-o1, DeepSeek-R1, and Qwen achieve
strong performance via extended chains of thought but often generate
unnecessarily long outputs. Maximizing intelligence per token--accuracy
relative to response length--remains an open problem. We revisit reinforcement
learning (RL) with the simplest length penalty--truncation--and show that
accuracy degradation arises not from the lack of sophisticated penalties but
from inadequate RL optimization. We identify three key challenges: (i) large
bias in advantage estimation, (ii) entropy collapse, and (iii) sparse reward
signal. We address them with Doing Length pEnalty Right (DLER), a training
recipe combining batch-wise reward normalization, higher clipping, dynamic
sampling, and a simple truncation length penalty. DLER achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy--efficiency trade-offs, cutting output length by over
70 percent while surpassing all previous baseline accuracy. It also improves
test-time scaling: compared to DeepSeek-R1-7B, DLER-7B generates multiple
concise responses in parallel with 28 percent higher accuracy and lower
latency. We further introduce Difficulty-Aware DLER, which adaptively tightens
truncation on easier questions for additional efficiency gains. We also propose
an update-selective merging method that preserves baseline accuracy while
retaining the concise reasoning ability of the DLER model, which is useful for
scenarios where RL training data is scarce.

Abstract: Identifying the effects of mechanical ventilation strategies and protocols in
critical care requires analyzing data from heterogeneous patient-ventilator
systems within the context of the clinical decision-making environment. This
research develops a framework to help understand the consequences of mechanical
ventilation (MV) and adjunct care decisions on patient outcome from
observations of critical care patients receiving MV. Developing an
understanding of and improving critical care respiratory management requires
the analysis of existing secondary-use clinical data to generate hypotheses
about advantageous variations and adaptations of current care. This work
introduces a perspective of the joint patient-ventilator-care systems
(so-called J6) to develop a scalable method for analyzing data and trajectories
of these complex systems. To that end, breath behaviors are analyzed using
evolutionary game theory (EGT), which generates the necessary quantitative
precursors for deeper analysis through probabilistic and stochastic machinery
such as reinforcement learning. This result is one step along the pathway
toward MV optimization and personalization. The EGT-based process is
analytically validated on synthetic data to reveal potential caveats before
proceeding to real-world ICU data applications that expose complexities of the
data-generating process J6. The discussion includes potential developments
toward a state transition model for the simulating effects of MV decision using
empirical and game-theoretic elements.

*Alex Shtoff*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种基于图拉普拉斯算子的非参数概率质量函数估计方法，通过数据依赖的低通滤波来估计多峰重尾分布，具有计算可靠、速度快的特点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对大离散支撑集上的多峰重尾概率质量函数估计问题，传统方法在处理噪声和保持粗粒度结构方面存在挑战。

Method: 将经验PMF视为线图上的信号，构建对称三对角算子（路径图拉普拉斯加上经验PMF构建的对角矩阵），计算最小特征值对应的特征向量，将经验PMF投影到低维子空间，最后进行裁剪和重归一化处理。

Result: 在合成和真实重尾数据上，该方法能有效保持粗粒度结构同时抑制采样噪声，在目标场景下优于logspline和高斯KDE基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法实现简洁、对样本量鲁棒、计算可靠快速，适合自动化流水线和大规模探索性分析，但存在已知的失效模式（如突然不连续性）。

Abstract: We study nonparametric estimation of a probability mass function (PMF) on a
large discrete support, where the PMF is multi-modal and heavy-tailed. The core
idea is to treat the empirical PMF as a signal on a line graph and apply a
data-dependent low-pass filter. Concretely, we form a symmetric tri-diagonal
operator, the path graph Laplacian perturbed with a diagonal matrix built from
the empirical PMF, then compute the eigenvectors, corresponding to the smallest
feq eigenvalues. Projecting the empirical PMF onto this low dimensional
subspace produces a smooth, multi-modal estimate that preserves coarse
structure while suppressing noise. A light post-processing step of clipping and
re-normalizing yields a valid PMF.
  Because we compute the eigenpairs of a symmetric tridiagonal matrix, the
computation is reliable and runs time and memory proportional to the support
times the dimension of the desired low-dimensional supspace. We also provide a
practical, data-driven rule for selecting the dimension based on an
orthogonal-series risk estimate, so the method "just works" with minimal
tuning. On synthetic and real heavy-tailed examples, the approach preserves
coarse structure while suppressing sampling noise, compares favorably to
logspline and Gaussian-KDE baselines in the intended regimes. However, it has
known failure modes (e.g., abrupt discontinuities). The method is short to
implement, robust across sample sizes, and suitable for automated pipelines and
exploratory analysis at scale because of its reliability and speed.

Motivation: 研究恐怖主义事件周计数的短期预测，建立可复现的预测管道，评估双向LSTM相对于经典基准和深度基线的性能。

Method: 构建基于固定时间分割的可复现管道，使用双向LSTM模型，与季节性朴素、线性/ARIMA和LSTM-Attention基线进行比较，进行消融实验分析时间记忆、训练历史长度、空间粒度等影响因素。

Result: 双向LSTM在测试集上表现最佳（RMSE 6.38），相比LSTM-Attention提升30.6%，相比线性滞后回归提升35.4%。长历史数据训练、中等回看窗口（20-30周）和双向编码对性能至关重要。

Conclusion: 该研究为GTD事件预测提供了一个透明、超越基线的参考框架，双向LSTM在捕捉窗口内的积累和后续模式方面表现优异，短期结构特征贡献最大。

Abstract: We study short-horizon forecasting of weekly terrorism incident counts using
the Global Terrorism Database (GTD, 1970--2016). We build a reproducible
pipeline with fixed time-based splits and evaluate a Bidirectional LSTM
(BiLSTM) against strong classical anchors (seasonal-naive, linear/ARIMA) and a
deep LSTM-Attention baseline. On the held-out test set, the BiLSTM attains RMSE
6.38, outperforming LSTM-Attention (9.19; +30.6\%) and a linear lag-regression
baseline (+35.4\% RMSE gain), with parallel improvements in MAE and MAPE.
Ablations varying temporal memory, training-history length, spatial grain,
lookback size, and feature groups show that models trained on long historical
data generalize best; a moderate lookback (20--30 weeks) provides strong
context; and bidirectional encoding is critical for capturing both build-up and
aftermath patterns within the window. Feature-group analysis indicates that
short-horizon structure (lagged counts and rolling statistics) contributes
most, with geographic and casualty features adding incremental lift. We release
code, configs, and compact result tables, and provide a data/ethics statement
documenting GTD licensing and research-only use. Overall, the study offers a
transparent, baseline-beating reference for GTD incident forecasting.

Method: 研究策略迁移方法，在连续时间LQR框架下，使用源任务的最优策略初始化目标任务的学习。提出了一种新的连续时间LQR策略学习算法，实现全局线性和局部超线性收敛。

Result: 理论证明了策略迁移在连续时间RL中的有效性，提出的新算法具有优越的收敛性能。作为分析副产品，还通过LQR连接推导了一类连续时间基于分数的扩散模型的稳定性。

Conclusion: 本文填补了连续时间RL中迁移学习的理论空白，将离散时间的研究扩展到连续时间，为RL效率提升提供了理论保证和算法支持。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) enables agents to learn optimal decision-making
strategies through interaction with an environment, yet training from scratch
on complex tasks can be highly inefficient. Transfer learning (TL), widely
successful in large language models (LLMs), offers a promising direction for
enhancing RL efficiency by leveraging pre-trained models.
  This paper investigates policy transfer, a TL approach that initializes
learning in a target RL task using a policy from a related source task, in the
context of continuous-time linear quadratic regulators (LQRs) with entropy
regularization. We provide the first theoretical proof of policy transfer for
continuous-time RL, proving that a policy optimal for one LQR serves as a
near-optimal initialization for closely related LQRs, while preserving the
original algorithm's convergence rate. Furthermore, we introduce a novel policy
learning algorithm for continuous-time LQRs that achieves global linear and
local super-linear convergence. Our results demonstrate both theoretical
guarantees and algorithmic benefits of transfer learning in continuous-time RL,
addressing a gap in existing literature and extending prior work from discrete
to continuous time settings.
  As a byproduct of our analysis, we derive the stability of a class of
continuous-time score-based diffusion models via their connection with LQRs.

Method: 使用统计物理方法推导出贝叶斯后验的自洽平均场理论，分析随机梯度朗之万动力学训练的两层非线性网络，并引入自增强输入特征选择机制来改进理论。

Result: 无限宽度下理论简化为核岭回归，有限宽度下预测到对称性破缺相变；基本平均场理论能半定量预测特征学习的出现，但低估了泛化改进；加入自增强特征选择机制后能与实验学习曲线定量匹配。

Conclusion: 该平均场理论为特征学习提供了机制性理解，揭示了自增强输入特征选择在特征学习中的关键作用。

Abstract: Feature learning (FL), where neural networks adapt their internal
representations during training, remains poorly understood. Using methods from
statistical physics, we derive a tractable, self-consistent mean-field (MF)
theory for the Bayesian posterior of two-layer non-linear networks trained with
stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (SGLD). At infinite width, this theory
reduces to kernel ridge regression, but at finite width it predicts a symmetry
breaking phase transition where networks abruptly align with target functions.
While the basic MF theory provides theoretical insight into the emergence of FL
in the finite-width regime, semi-quantitatively predicting the onset of FL with
noise or sample size, it substantially underestimates the improvements in
generalisation after the transition. We trace this discrepancy to a key
mechanism absent from the plain MF description: \textit{self-reinforcing input
feature selection}. Incorporating this mechanism into the MF theory allows us
to quantitatively match the learning curves of SGLD-trained networks and
provides mechanistic insight into FL.

Abstract: Geodesic problems involve computing trajectories between prescribed initial
and final states to minimize a user-defined measure of distance, cost, or
energy. They arise throughout physics and engineering -- for instance, in
determining optimal paths through complex environments, modeling light
propagation in refractive media, and the study of spacetime trajectories in
control theory and general relativity. Despite their ubiquity, the scientific
machine learning (SciML) community has given relatively little attention to
investigating its methods in the context of these problems. In this work, we
argue that given their simple geometry, variational structure, and natural
nonlinearity, geodesic problems are particularly well-suited for the Deep Ritz
method. We substantiate this claim with three numerical examples drawn from
path planning, optics, and solid mechanics. Our goal is not to provide an
exhaustive study of geodesic problems, but rather to identify a promising
application of the Deep Ritz method and a fruitful direction for future SciML
research.

Motivation: 传统髋部骨折风险评估工具如DXA T-score和FRAX缺乏敏感性，特别是对于无既往骨折史或骨质减少的高风险人群，需要更准确的风险评估方法。

Method: 采用顺序两阶段模型：第一阶段使用临床、人口统计学和功能变量进行筛查，第二阶段结合DXA衍生特征进行精炼预测。基于MrOS、SOF和UK Biobank数据集开发。

Result: 经过内部和外部验证，该模型在不同队列中表现一致且适应性强。相比T-score和FRAX，实现了更高的敏感性和更少的漏诊病例。

Abstract: Hip fractures are a major cause of disability, mortality, and healthcare
burden in older adults, underscoring the need for early risk assessment.
However, commonly used tools such as the DXA T-score and FRAX often lack
sensitivity and miss individuals at high risk, particularly those without prior
fractures or with osteopenia. To address this limitation, we propose a
sequential two-stage model that integrates clinical and imaging information to
improve prediction accuracy. Using data from the Osteoporotic Fractures in Men
Study (MrOS), the Study of Osteoporotic Fractures (SOF), and the UK Biobank,
Stage 1 (Screening) employs clinical, demographic, and functional variables to
estimate baseline risk, while Stage 2 (Imaging) incorporates DXA-derived
features for refinement. The model was rigorously validated through internal
and external testing, showing consistent performance and adaptability across
cohorts. Compared to T-score and FRAX, the two-stage framework achieved higher
sensitivity and reduced missed cases, offering a cost-effective and
personalized approach for early hip fracture risk assessment.

Abstract: Crashworthiness assessment is a critical aspect of automotive design,
traditionally relying on high-fidelity finite element (FE) simulations that are
computationally expensive and time-consuming. This work presents an exploratory
comparative study on developing machine learning-based surrogate models for
efficient prediction of structural deformation in crash scenarios using the
NVIDIA PhysicsNeMo framework. Given the limited prior work applying machine
learning to structural crash dynamics, the primary contribution lies in
demonstrating the feasibility and engineering utility of the various modeling
approaches explored in this work. We investigate two state-of-the-art neural
network architectures for modeling crash dynamics: MeshGraphNet, and
Transolver. Additionally, we examine three strategies for modeling transient
dynamics: time-conditional, the standard Autoregressive approach, and a
stability-enhanced Autoregressive scheme incorporating rollout-based training.
The models are evaluated on a comprehensive Body-in-White (BIW) crash dataset
comprising 150 detailed FE simulations using LS-DYNA. The dataset represents a
structurally rich vehicle assembly with over 200 components, including 38 key
components featuring variable thickness distributions to capture realistic
manufacturing variability. Each model utilizes the undeformed mesh geometry and
component characteristics as inputs to predict the spatiotemporal evolution of
the deformed mesh during the crash sequence. Evaluation results show that the
models capture the overall deformation trends with reasonable fidelity,
demonstrating the feasibility of applying machine learning to structural crash
dynamics. Although not yet matching full FE accuracy, the models achieve
orders-of-magnitude reductions in computational cost, enabling rapid design
exploration and early-stage optimization in crashworthiness evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mahalanobis距离方法在OOD检测中广泛使用，但其性能受表示几何和归一化的影响尚未完全理解，这限制了其下游应用。

Method: 在多样化图像基础模型、数据集和距离归一化方案上进行全面实证研究，分析表示几何特性，并提出径向缩放ℓ2归一化方法。

Conclusion: 通过连接表示几何、归一化和OOD性能之间的差距，为设计更有效可靠的深度学习模型提供了新见解。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is critical for the reliable deployment
of deep learning models. hile Mahalanobis distance methods are widely used, the
impact of representation geometry and normalization on their performance is not
fully understood, which may limit their downstream application. To address this
gap, we conducted a comprehensive empirical study across diverse image
foundation models, datasets, and distance normalization schemes. First, our
analysis shows that Mahalanobis-based methods aren't universally reliable.
Second, we define the ideal geometry for data representations and demonstrate
that spectral and intrinsic-dimensionality metrics can accurately predict a
model's OOD performance. Finally, we analyze how normalization impacts OOD
performance. Building upon these studies, we propose radially scaled $\ell_2$
normalization, a method that generalizes the standard $\ell_2$ normalization
recently applied to Mahalanobis-based OOD detection. Our approach introduces a
tunable parameter to directly control the radial geometry of the feature space,
systematically contracting or expanding representations to significantly

*Yongchan Kwon,Shang Zhu,Federico Bianchi,Kaitlyn Zhou,James Zou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了ReasonIF基准，用于评估大型推理模型在推理过程中遵循用户指令的能力，发现现有模型在这方面的表现较差，并探索了两种改进方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然之前的研究评估了模型主要回答中的指令遵循能力，但作者认为大型推理模型在推理过程中遵循用户指令同样重要，这能提高模型的可控性、透明度，并减少推理过程中的不良行为。

Method: 引入ReasonIF基准，包含六类指令提示，涵盖多语言推理、格式和长度控制。评估多个开源LRM，并探索多轮推理和推理指令微调两种改进策略。

Result: 现有LRM在推理指令遵循方面表现不佳，最高指令遵循得分低于0.25。任务难度增加时表现进一步下降。推理指令微调将GPT-OSS-20B的得分从0.11提升到0.27。

Conclusion: 大型推理模型在推理过程中遵循指令的能力存在显著不足，推理指令微调能带来改进但仍需大幅提升。

Abstract: The ability of large language models (LLMs) to follow user instructions is
central to their reliability, safety, and usefulness. While prior studies
assess instruction adherence in the model's main responses, we argue that it is
also critical for large reasoning models (LRMs) to follow user instructions
throughout their reasoning process. Reasoning instruction following makes LRMs
more controllable and transparent, while reducing risks of undesirable
shortcuts, hallucinations, or reward hacking within reasoning traces. To
evaluate this dimension, we introduce ReasonIF, a systematic benchmark for
assessing reasoning instruction following. ReasonIF includes six categories of
instruction prompts, spanning multilingual reasoning, formatting and length
control. Across many open-source LRMs including GPT-OSS, Qwen3, and
DeepSeek-R1, we find substantial failures in reasoning instruction adherence:
the highest instruction following score (IFS) remains below 0.25, meaning that
fewer than $25\%$ of reasoning traces comply with the given instructions.
Notably, as task difficulty increases, reasoning instruction following degrades
further. We also explore two strategies to enhance reasoning instruction
fidelity. (1) multi-turn reasoning and (2) Reasoning Instruction Finetuning
(RIF) using synthetic data. RIF improves the IFS of $GPT-OSS-20B$ from 0.11 to
0.27, indicating measurable progress but leaving ample room for improvement.

*Kexin Zheng,Lauriane Teyssier,Yinan Zheng,Yu Luo,Xiayuan Zhan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BREEZE是一个改进的零样本强化学习框架，通过行为正则化、扩散模型策略提取和注意力架构，解决了现有方法在表达性和外推误差方面的问题，在稳定性和性能上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有零样本RL方法（如Forward-Backward表示）存在表达性不足和离线学习中外推误差导致表示偏差的问题，最终导致次优性能。

Method: BREEZE引入行为正则化将策略优化转化为稳定的样本内学习，使用任务条件扩散模型提取策略以生成高质量多模态动作分布，并采用表达性注意力架构进行表示建模。

Result: 在ExORL和D4RL Kitchen数据集上的广泛实验表明，BREEZE实现了最佳或接近最佳的性能，同时展现出比现有离线零样本RL方法更优越的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: BREEZE通过同时增强学习稳定性、策略提取能力和表示学习质量，有效解决了零样本RL中的关键挑战，为预训练通用策略的零样本适应提供了改进方案。

Abstract: The recent development of zero-shot reinforcement learning (RL) has opened a
new avenue for learning pre-trained generalist policies that can adapt to
arbitrary new tasks in a zero-shot manner. While the popular Forward-Backward
representations (FB) and related methods have shown promise in zero-shot RL, we
empirically found that their modeling lacks expressivity and that extrapolation
errors caused by out-of-distribution (OOD) actions during offline learning
sometimes lead to biased representations, ultimately resulting in suboptimal
performance. To address these issues, we propose Behavior-REgularizEd Zero-shot
RL with Expressivity enhancement (BREEZE), an upgraded FB-based framework that
simultaneously enhances learning stability, policy extraction capability, and
representation learning quality. BREEZE introduces behavioral regularization in
zero-shot RL policy learning, transforming policy optimization into a stable
in-sample learning paradigm. Additionally, BREEZE extracts the policy using a
task-conditioned diffusion model, enabling the generation of high-quality and
multimodal action distributions in zero-shot RL settings. Moreover, BREEZE
employs expressive attention-based architectures for representation modeling to
capture the complex relationships between environmental dynamics. Extensive
experiments on ExORL and D4RL Kitchen demonstrate that BREEZE achieves the best
or near-the-best performance while exhibiting superior robustness compared to
prior offline zero-shot RL methods. The official implementation is available
at: https://github.com/Whiterrrrr/BREEZE.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文发现预训练模型的推理潜力与其内在区分正确知识与错误知识的能力相关，通过提出的SAL指标可以准确预测模型在RLVR后的推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究为什么不同基础模型在RLVR后性能差异巨大，探索预训练模型的微观特性如何影响推理能力。

Method: 将推理形式化为Horn子句链，使用跨层稀疏自编码器提取特征，估计特征间转移概率，并用LLM对规则语义正确性分类，提出SAL指标量化分布分离度。

Result: 发现高性能模型具有内在的正确性感知能力，其内部概率分布在正确与错误规则间显著分离，而弱模型则无此区分能力。SAL指标与RLVR后推理性能高度相关(R^2=0.87)。

Conclusion: 模型的推理潜力取决于其预训练时区分正确与错误知识的内在能力，SAL为选择和设计更强基础模型提供了基于内部机制的实际指标。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) can elicit strong
reasoning in large language models (LLMs), while their performance after RLVR
varies dramatically across different base models. This raises a fundamental
question: what microscopic property of pre-trained models leads to this
variation? To investigate, we formalize reasoning as chains of Horn clauses
("if-then" rules) built from features extracted from the LLM's latent space via
cross-layer sparse autoencoders (SAEs). We estimate the transition
probabilities between its features, and further categorize each rule by its
semantic soundness level (e.g., strict, plausible, noisy) with an LLM. Our key
discovery is that high-potential models are inherently soundness-aware: their
internal probability distributions systematically shift across rules' soundness
levels, becoming highly distinct for "strict" versus "noisy" rules. In
contrast, weaker models are soundness-agnostic, collapsing to one distribution
regardless of soundness levels. To quantify this, we introduce the
Soundness-Aware Level (SAL), a microscopic metric using the Jensen-Shannon
Divergence to measure the separation between these distributions. We show that
SAL's predictions of post-RLVR reasoning performance follow a precise empirical
law (R^2=0.87) across diverse model families (Qwen, Mistral, Llama, DeepSeek)
and scales (0.5B-14B). This reveals that a model's reasoning potential is tied
to its intrinsic, pre-trained ability to distinguish sound knowledge from
unsound ones. These findings underscore the critical role of model pre-training
in shaping reasoning and offer a practical metric grounded in the model's
internal mechanisms for selecting/designing stronger base models.

TL;DR: 基于MIMIC-III数据库，使用集成学习方法开发脑膜炎诊断模型，在模拟急诊场景下取得了优异性能（测试集AUC分别为0.9637和0.9472）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发能够在真实急诊场景下辅助诊断脑膜炎的AI工具，提高临床应用的实用性。

Method: 使用214例脑膜炎患者和46,303例非脑膜炎患者数据，经过数据预处理和两阶段特征选择，采用随机森林、LightGBM和DNN作为基础模型，通过集成学习（堆叠逻辑回归元模型）进行模型融合。

Result: 模型在两个测试集上表现优异，AUC分别达到0.9637和0.9472，选出了性别、蛛网膜下腔出血、脑继发性恶性肿瘤、全身性癫痫等高危ICD代码等临床相关特征。

Conclusion: 虽然直接部署临床诊断工具仍具挑战，但本研究为未来基于集成学习的AI驱动脑膜炎诊断方法奠定了基础。

Abstract: We utilized a cohort of 214 meningitis patients and 46,303 non-meningitis
patients from the MIMIC-III database. After extensive data preprocessing, which
included ICD-based cohort selection, one-hot encoding of coding, and a
two-stage feature selection process (for both the training set and the testing
sets), clinically relevant features such as gender and high-risk ICD codes
(including subarachnoid hemorrhage, secondary malignant neoplasm of the brain,
and generalized epilepsy) are selected. Overall, these clinically reasonable
and temporally adherent features provided excellent modeling performance. Three
models (Random Forest, LightGBM, and Deep Neural Networks (DNN) are trained as
base models for Ensemble Learning. Base model outputs are aggregated and
stacked into a meta model (Logistic Regression) that uses the base model
outputs as input values in training. Ultimately, soldier outputs (AUC of
Testing Set 1: 0.9637, AUC of Testing Set 2: 0.9472) are obtained through
ensemble learning.
  We created a challenging condition for diagnosing meningitis, simulating a
real-world ER (Emergency Room) scenario to enhance clinical use in real-world
applications. While directly deploying a diagnostic tool that clinicians can
use is challenging, this paper paves the way for a potential future AI-driven
diagnostic approach for meningitis using Ensemble Learning.

\cite{medina2025integratingproductcoefficientsimproved}, measure-theoretic
descriptors that complement the original spatial Lidar features. Here, we show
that combining product coefficients with an autoencoder representation and a
KNN classifier delivers consistent performance gains over both PCA-based
baselines and our earlier framework. We also investigate the effect of adding
product coefficients level by level, revealing a clear trend: richer sets of
coefficients systematically improve class separability and overall accuracy.
The results highlight the value of combining hierarchical product-coefficient

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We study sequential decision-making under distribution drift. We propose
entropy-regularized trust-decay, which injects stress-aware exponential tilting
into both belief updates and mirror-descent decisions. On the simplex, a
Fenchel-dual equivalence shows that belief tilt and decision tilt coincide. We
formalize robustness via fragility (worst-case excess risk in a KL ball),
belief bandwidth (radius sustaining a target excess), and a decision-space
Fragility Index (drift tolerated at $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret). We prove
high-probability sensitivity bounds and establish dynamic-regret guarantees of
$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ under KL-drift path length $S_T = \sum_{t\ge2}\sqrt{{\rm
KL}(D_t|D_{t-1})/2}$. In particular, trust-decay achieves $O(1)$ per-switch
regret, while stress-free updates incur $\Omega(1)$ tails. A parameter-free
hedge adapts the tilt to unknown drift, whereas persistent over-tilting yields
an $\Omega(\lambda^2 T)$ stationary penalty. We further obtain
calibrated-stress bounds and extensions to second-order updates, bandit
feedback, outliers, stress variation, distributed optimization, and plug-in
KL-drift estimation. The framework unifies dynamic-regret analysis,
distributionally robust objectives, and KL-regularized control within a single
stress-adaptive update.

Motivation: 由于金融领域的高风险和高利益特性，在真实金融应用中部署LLM仍面临挑战，需要系统评估其可信度。

Method: 构建FinTrust基准，基于实际场景设计广泛的对齐问题，为每个可信度评估维度创建细粒度任务。

Result: 评估11个LLM发现：专有模型如o4-mini在安全性等多数任务中表现更好，开源模型如DeepSeek-V3在行业公平性等特定领域有优势，所有模型在信托对齐和披露等挑战性任务中都表现不足。

Conclusion: FinTrust可作为金融领域LLM可信度评估的有价值基准，当前LLM在法律意识方面存在显著差距。

Abstract: Recent LLMs have demonstrated promising ability in solving finance related
problems. However, applying LLMs in real-world finance application remains
challenging due to its high risk and high stakes property. This paper
introduces FinTrust, a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for
evaluating the trustworthiness of LLMs in finance applications. Our benchmark
focuses on a wide range of alignment issues based on practical context and
features fine-grained tasks for each dimension of trustworthiness evaluation.
We assess eleven LLMs on FinTrust and find that proprietary models like o4-mini
outperforms in most tasks such as safety while open-source models like
DeepSeek-V3 have advantage in specific areas like industry-level fairness. For
challenging task like fiduciary alignment and disclosure, all LLMs fall short,
showing a significant gap in legal awareness. We believe that FinTrust can be a
valuable benchmark for LLMs' trustworthiness evaluation in finance domain.

TL;DR: TESSERA是一种新的不确定性量化方法，结合专家混合模型和保形校准，为蛋白质-配体亲和力预测提供可靠、信息丰富且自适应的不确定性区间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前ML社区缺乏可靠、信息丰富且个体化的不确定性量化方法，这阻碍了AI/ML在风险敏感领域的应用。特别是在药物发现中，蛋白质-配体亲和力预测面临异质性噪声、化学空间不平衡和分布偏移等挑战。

Method: TESSERA结合专家混合模型的多样性和保形校准，提供具有可靠覆盖保证的逐样本不确定性，生成信息丰富且自适应的预测区间宽度。

Result: 在i.i.d.和基于支架的OOD分割下，TESSERA实现了接近名义覆盖率和最佳覆盖-宽度权衡，同时保持竞争性的自适应能力。大小分层覆盖证实区间大小合适。

Conclusion: TESSERA通过统一专家混合模型多样性和保形校准，提供可信、紧凑且自适应的不确定性，适用于药物发现管道中的选择性预测和下游决策。

Abstract: Reliable, informative, and individual uncertainty quantification (UQ) remains
missing in current ML community. This hinders the effective application of
AI/ML to risk-sensitive domains. Most methods either fail to provide coverage
on new data, inflate intervals so broadly that they are not actionable, or
assign uncertainties that do not track actual error, especially under a
distribution shift. In high-stakes drug discovery, protein-ligand affinity
(PLI) prediction is especially challenging as assay noise is heterogeneous,
chemical space is imbalanced and large, and practical evaluations routinely
involve distribution shift. In this work, we introduce a novel uncertainty
quantification method, Trustworthy Expert Split-conformal with Scaled
Estimation for Efficient Reliable Adaptive intervals (TESSERA), that provides
per-sample uncertainty with reliable coverage guarantee, informative and
adaptive prediction interval widths that track the absolute error. We evaluate
on protein-ligand binding affinity prediction under both independent and
identically distributed (i.i.d.) and scaffold-based out-of-distribution (OOD)
splits, comparing against strong UQ baselines. TESSERA attains near-nominal
coverage and the best coverage-width trade-off as measured by the
Coverage-Width Criterion (CWC), while maintaining competitive adaptivity
(lowest Area Under the Sparsification Error (AUSE)). Size-Stratified Coverage
(SSC) further confirms that intervals are right-sized, indicating width
increases when data are scarce or noisy, and remain tight when predictions are
reliable. By unifying Mixture of Expert (MoE) diversity with conformal
calibration, TESSERA delivers trustworthy, tight, and adaptive uncertainties
that are well-suited to selective prediction and downstream decision-making in
the drug-discovery pipeline and other applications.

Motivation: 强化学习在可验证答案任务上有效扩展思维链推理，但在非可验证的人类偏好任务上仍具挑战性且研究不足。

Method: DWRL通过双权重RL目标整合思维链推理与BT模型，包含实例级错位权重和组级条件偏好分数，训练生成式偏好模型先产生思维再预测偏好分数。

Result: 在多个基准测试和模型规模上，DWRL持续优于GPM基线和标量模型，同时产生连贯、可解释的思维。

Conclusion: DWRL作为推理增强偏好学习的通用框架，可扩展到可验证任务之外。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently proven effective at scaling
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning in large language models on tasks with
verifiable answers. However, extending RL to more general non-verifiable tasks,
typically in the format of human preference pairs, remains both challenging and
underexplored. In this work, we propose Dual-Weighted Reinforcement Learning
(DWRL), a new framework for preference modeling that integrates CoT reasoning
with the Bradley-Terry (BT) model via a dual-weighted RL objective that
preserves preference-modeling inductive bias. DWRL approximates the
maximum-likelihood objective of the BT model with two complementary weights: an
instance-wise misalignment weight, which emphasizes under-trained pairs
misaligned with human preference, and a group-wise (self-normalized)
conditional preference score, which promotes promising thoughts. In this paper,
we apply DWRL to preference modeling by training generative preference models
(GPMs) to first generate a thought and then predict the human preference score.
Across multiple benchmarks and model scales (Llama3 and Qwen2.5), DWRL
consistently outperforms both GPM baselines and scalar models, while producing
coherent, interpretable thoughts. In summary, our results position DWRL as a
general framework for reasoning-enhanced preference learning beyond verifiable
tasks.

Abstract: Accurate forecasting of avian disease outbreaks is critical for wildlife
conservation and public health. This study presents a Transformer-based
framework for predicting the disease risk at the terminal locations of
migratory bird trajectories. We integrate multi-source datasets, including GPS
tracking data from Movebank, outbreak records from the World Organisation for
Animal Health (WOAH), and geospatial context from GADM and Natural Earth. The
raw coordinates are processed using H3 hierarchical geospatial encoding to
capture spatial patterns. The model learns spatiotemporal dependencies from
bird movement sequences to estimate endpoint disease risk. Evaluation on a
held-out test set demonstrates strong predictive performance, achieving an
accuracy of 0.9821, area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.9803, average precision
(AP) of 0.9299, and an F1-score of 0.8836 at the optimal threshold. These
results highlight the potential of Transformer architectures to support
early-warning systems for avian disease surveillance, enabling timely
intervention and prevention strategies.

*Yangyang Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DRO-InstructZero通过分布鲁棒优化方法改进零样本提示优化，在分布偏移和对抗性评估中显著提升提示的可靠性和可迁移性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自动提示搜索方法（如InstructZero）在单一评估分布下优化预期性能，导致提示在分布偏移和对抗性评估中表现不佳，缺乏可靠性。

Method: 将零样本提示优化建模为鲁棒贝叶斯优化，使用f-散度球定义评估分布周围的模糊集，通过鲁棒采集规则最大化最坏情况期望效用，同时保持贝叶斯搜索的查询效率。

Result: 在形式化改写、代码调试和翻译任务中，准确率显著提升：BIG-Bench形式化改写从61.3%提升至85-90%，代码调试在领域偏移下提升约25个百分点，稳定任务保持96%以上准确率。

Conclusion: DRO-InstructZero将分布鲁棒优化与提示学习结合，提供了一种即插即用的通用方法，在真实世界不确定性下实现可靠、可迁移的提示对齐。

Abstract: Large language models are highly sensitive to prompt wording. However,
popular automatic prompt search methods, including InstructZero, often degrade
under distribution shift and adversarial evaluation because they optimize
expected performance under a single evaluation distribution. Consequently,
prompts that work in one setting frequently fail to transfer. To address this,
DRO-InstructZero formulates zero-shot prompt optimization as robust Bayesian
optimization. Specifically, an f-divergence ball defines an ambiguity set
around the evaluation distribution, and a robust acquisition rule maximizes
worst-case expected utility while retaining the query efficiency of Bayesian
search. Therefore, the search explicitly targets reliability under distribution
shift rather than average behavior alone. Experiments follow the
instruction-induction protocol with matched query budgets across formality
rewriting, code debugging, and translation. For example, on BIG-Bench
informative-to-formal rewriting, accuracy improves from 61.3 +/- 0.7% to
approximately 85-90%, yielding an absolute gain of about 25-30 points.
Moreover, auto-debugging shows about +25-point gains under domain shift.
Meanwhile, stable tasks such as cause-and-effect remain above 96%, indicating
no loss on in-distribution cases. Furthermore, improvements are consistent
across divergence choices and decoding temperatures. Overall, DRO-InstructZero
connects distributionally robust optimization with prompt learning, offering a
plug-and-play and general approach for reliable, transferable prompt alignment
under real-world uncertainty.

TL;DR: 提出了AdamW优化器的权重衰减缩放规则，结合μP学习率规则，实现跨宽度零-shot超参数迁移，无需为每个宽度单独调参


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代尺度不变架构中，训练快速进入优化器主导的稳态，归一化层造成反向尺度敏感性，使有效学习率与宽度相关，破坏了μP的迁移能力

Method: 引入权重衰减缩放规则λ₂∝√d，结合矩阵参数学习率η₂∝d⁻¹和向量参数η₁=Θ_d(1)、λ₁=0，保持子层增益跨宽度不变

Result: 在LLaMA风格Transformer和最小合成设置中验证了规则有效性，提供了匹配顶部奇异值的简单诊断方法

Conclusion: 通过显式控制优化器设定的稳态尺度，将μP扩展到近初始化阶段之外，为AdamW下的宽度鲁棒超参数迁移提供了实用方案

Abstract: Empirical scaling laws prescribe how to allocate parameters, data, and
compute, while maximal-update parameterization ($\mu$P) enables learning-rate
transfer across widths by equalizing early-time update magnitudes. However, in
modern scale-invariant architectures, training quickly enters an
optimizer-governed steady state where normalization layers create backward
scale sensitivity and the effective learning rate becomes width dependent,
degrading $\mu$P transfer. We address this by introducing a weight-decay
scaling rule for AdamW that preserves sublayer gain across widths. Empirically,
the singular-value spectrum of each matrix parameter scales in norm as
$\sqrt{\eta/\lambda}$ with an approximately invariant shape; under width
scaling $d$, we observe that the top singular value scales approximately as
$\sqrt{\eta/\lambda}\cdot d^{0.75}$. Combining this observation with the $\mu$P
learning-rate rule $\eta_2\propto d^{-1}$ for matrix-like parameters implies an
empirical weight-decay scaling rule $\lambda_2\propto \sqrt{d}$ that
approximately keeps sublayer gains width invariant. Together with vector-like
parameters trained at $\eta_1=\Theta_d(1)$ and $\lambda_1=0$, this yields
\emph{zero-shot} transfer of both learning rate and weight decay from proxy to
target widths, removing per-width sweeps. We validate the rule on LLaMA-style
Transformers and in a minimal synthetic setting, and we provide a simple
diagnostic, matching top singular values, to check sublayer-gain invariance.
Our results extend $\mu$P beyond the near-init regime by explicitly controlling
steady-state scales set by the optimizer, offering a practical recipe for
width-robust hyperparameter transfer under AdamW.

TL;DR: 提出RIC-TSC框架，将因果发现融入时序分类，在格陵兰冰上湖演化预测中比相关性基线准确率提升12.59%，展示了因果建模在地球观测中的泛化优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前时空地球观测模型依赖相关性特征，在异质域间迁移性差。因果建模能发现稳定不变关系，提高分布偏移下的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Method: 使用J-PCMCI+进行区域特定和不变预测因子的因果发现，将验证的预测因子及其时间滞后输入轻量级分类器。基于多模态卫星数据（Sentinel-1、Sentinel-2、Landsat-8）和CARRA气象变量。

Conclusion: 因果发现不仅是特征选择手段，更是构建可泛化、机制基础的地球表面动态过程模型的途径。

Abstract: Causal modeling offers a principled foundation for uncovering stable,
invariant relationships in time-series data, thereby improving robustness and
generalization under distribution shifts. Yet its potential is underutilized in
spatiotemporal Earth observation, where models often depend on purely
correlational features that fail to transfer across heterogeneous domains. We
propose RIC-TSC, a regionally-informed causal time-series classification
framework that embeds lag-aware causal discovery directly into sequence
modeling, enabling both predictive accuracy and scientific interpretability.
Using multi-modal satellite and reanalysis data-including Sentinel-1 microwave
backscatter, Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 optical reflectance, and CARRA
meteorological variables-we leverage Joint PCMCI+ (J-PCMCI+) to identify
region-specific and invariant predictors of supraglacial lake evolution in
Greenland. Causal graphs are estimated globally and per basin, with validated
predictors and their time lags supplied to lightweight classifiers. On a
balanced benchmark of 1000 manually labeled lakes from two contrasting melt
seasons (2018-2019), causal models achieve up to 12.59% higher accuracy than
correlation-based baselines under out-of-distribution evaluation. These results
show that causal discovery is not only a means of feature selection but also a
pathway to generalizable and mechanistically grounded models of dynamic Earth
surface processes.

Abstract: Pseudo-labeling is a commonly used paradigm in semi-supervised learning, yet
its application to semi-supervised regression (SSR) remains relatively
under-explored. Unlike classification, where pseudo-labels are discrete and
confidence-based filtering is effective, SSR involves continuous outputs with
heteroscedastic noise, making it challenging to assess pseudo-label
reliability. As a result, naive pseudo-labeling can lead to error accumulation
and overfitting to incorrect labels. To address this, we propose an
uncertainty-aware pseudo-labeling framework that dynamically adjusts
pseudo-label influence from a bi-level optimization perspective. By jointly
minimizing empirical risk over all data and optimizing uncertainty estimates to
enhance generalization on labeled data, our method effectively mitigates the
impact of unreliable pseudo-labels. We provide theoretical insights and
extensive experiments to validate our approach across various benchmark SSR
datasets, and the results demonstrate superior robustness and performance
compared to existing methods. Our code is available at
https://github.com/sxq/Heteroscedastic-Pseudo-Labels.

Conclusion: 基础模型正在催化科学范式的转变，需要科学界共同反思科学发现的未来发展方向。

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs), such as GPT-4 and AlphaFold, are reshaping the
landscape of scientific research. Beyond accelerating tasks such as hypothesis
generation, experimental design, and result interpretation, they prompt a more
fundamental question: Are FMs merely enhancing existing scientific
methodologies, or are they redefining the way science is conducted? In this
paper, we argue that FMs are catalyzing a transition toward a new scientific
paradigm. We introduce a three-stage framework to describe this evolution: (1)
Meta-Scientific Integration, where FMs enhance workflows within traditional
paradigms; (2) Hybrid Human-AI Co-Creation, where FMs become active
collaborators in problem formulation, reasoning, and discovery; and (3)
Autonomous Scientific Discovery, where FMs operate as independent agents
capable of generating new scientific knowledge with minimal human intervention.
Through this lens, we review current applications and emerging capabilities of
FMs across existing scientific paradigms. We further identify risks and future
directions for FM-enabled scientific discovery. This position paper aims to
support the scientific community in understanding the transformative role of
FMs and to foster reflection on the future of scientific discovery. Our project

Motivation: 传统集合数据同化方法在分析精度和计算效率之间存在权衡，大集合规模提高精度但增加计算成本

Method: 使用小规模集合生成初步分析状态，然后用全连接神经网络学习并预测校正项来弥补集合规模限制

Result: 在Lorenz系统和非线性海洋波场模拟实验中，新方法比传统EnKF在相同集合规模下精度更高，且额外计算成本可忽略

Conclusion: EnKF-FCNN方法能够以较小计算成本获得更高精度，且可适应不同应用场景

Abstract: Ensemble-based data assimilation (DA) methods have become increasingly
popular due to their inherent ability to address nonlinear dynamic problems.
However, these methods often face a trade-off between analysis accuracy and
computational efficiency, as larger ensemble sizes required for higher accuracy
also lead to greater computational cost. In this study, we propose a novel
machine learning-based data assimilation approach that combines the traditional
ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) with a fully connected neural network (FCNN).
Specifically, our method uses a relatively small ensemble size to generate
preliminary yet suboptimal analysis states via EnKF. A FCNN is then employed to
learn and predict correction terms for these states, thereby mitigating the
performance degradation induced by the limited ensemble size. We evaluate the
performance of our proposed EnKF-FCNN method through numerical experiments
involving Lorenz systems and nonlinear ocean wave field simulations. The
results consistently demonstrate that the new method achieves higher accuracy
than traditional EnKF with the same ensemble size, while incurring negligible
additional computational cost. Moreover, the EnKF-FCNN method is adaptable to
diverse applications through coupling with different models and the use of
alternative ensemble-based DA methods.

Conclusion: DFCA具有鲁棒性和实用性，适用于动态现实世界去中心化网络。

Abstract: Clustered Federated Learning has emerged as an effective approach for
handling heterogeneous data across clients by partitioning them into clusters
with similar or identical data distributions. However, most existing methods,
including the Iterative Federated Clustering Algorithm (IFCA), rely on a
central server to coordinate model updates, which creates a bottleneck and a
single point of failure, limiting their applicability in more realistic
decentralized learning settings. In this work, we introduce DFCA, a fully
decentralized clustered FL algorithm that enables clients to collaboratively
train cluster-specific models without central coordination. DFCA uses a
sequential running average to aggregate models from neighbors as updates
arrive, providing a communication-efficient alternative to batch aggregation
while maintaining clustering performance. Our experiments on various datasets
demonstrate that DFCA outperforms other decentralized algorithms and performs
comparably to centralized IFCA, even under sparse connectivity, highlighting
its robustness and practicality for dynamic real-world decentralized networks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随机特征模型在机器学习中广泛应用，但传统方法需要大量特征才能达到良好性能。本文旨在通过可学习激活函数和数据依赖采样方案，显著减少所需特征数量，提高模型效率。

Method: 提出数据依赖的杠杆加权采样方案，通过寻找近似核并应用杠杆加权采样来学习加权RFLAF。提供了统一的理论框架描述特征数量复杂度，比较了普通采样方案和数据依赖杠杆加权方案。

Result: 通过加权采样，MSE损失情况下的特征数量边界从Ω(1/ε²)改进到~Ω((1/ε)^{1/t})，当Gram矩阵有限秩时甚至达到Ω(1)。对于Lipschitz损失，边界从Ω(1/ε²)改进到~Ω((1/ε²)^{1/t})。实证结果显示加权RFLAF用显著更少的特征达到相同性能。

Conclusion: 数据依赖的杠杆加权采样方案能够显著减少随机特征模型所需的特征数量，在保持性能的同时大幅提高模型效率，理论和实证结果都验证了该方法的有效性。

Abstract: This paper studies the generalization properties of a recently proposed
kernel method, the Random Feature models with Learnable Activation Functions
(RFLAF). By applying a data-dependent sampling scheme for generating features,
we provide by far the sharpest bounds on the required number of features for
learning RFLAF in both the regression and classification tasks. We provide a
unified theorem that describes the complexity of the feature number $s$, and
discuss the results for the plain sampling scheme and the data-dependent
leverage weighted scheme. Through weighted sampling, the bound on $s$ in the
MSE loss case is improved from $\Omega(1/\epsilon^2)$ to
$\tilde{\Omega}((1/\epsilon)^{1/t})$ in general $(t\geq 1)$, and even to
$\Omega(1)$ when the Gram matrix has a finite rank. For the Lipschitz loss
case, the bound is improved from $\Omega(1/\epsilon^2)$ to
$\tilde{\Omega}((1/\epsilon^2)^{1/t})$. To learn the weighted RFLAF, we also
propose an algorithm to find an approximate kernel and then apply the leverage
weighted sampling. Empirical results show that the weighted RFLAF achieves the
same performances with a significantly fewer number of features compared to the
plainly sampled RFLAF, validating our theories and the effectiveness of this
method.

Abstract: Extensive research has highlighted the vulnerability of graph neural networks
(GNNs) to adversarial attacks, including manipulation, node injection, and the
recently emerging threat of backdoor attacks. However, existing defenses
typically focus on a single type of attack, lacking a unified approach to
simultaneously defend against multiple threats. In this work, we leverage the
flexibility of the Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture to design a scalable
and unified framework for defending against backdoor, edge manipulation, and
node injection attacks. Specifically, we propose an MI-based logic diversity
loss to encourage individual experts to focus on distinct neighborhood
structures in their decision processes, thus ensuring a sufficient subset of
experts remains unaffected under perturbations in local structures. Moreover,
we introduce a robustness-aware router that identifies perturbation patterns
and adaptively routes perturbed nodes to corresponding robust experts.
Extensive experiments conducted under various adversarial settings demonstrate
that our method consistently achieves superior robustness against multiple
graph adversarial attacks.

Conclusion: 基于算子理论的序列建模方法能够有效处理高度非线性动态，谱均值流算法提供了可扩展的解决方案，在时间序列建模任务中表现良好。

Abstract: A key question in sequence modeling with neural networks is how to represent
and learn highly nonlinear and probabilistic state dynamics. Operator theory
views such dynamics as linear maps on Hilbert spaces containing mean embedding
vectors of distributions, offering an appealing but currently overlooked
perspective. We propose a new approach to sequence modeling based on an
operator-theoretic view of a hidden Markov model (HMM). Instead of
materializing stochastic recurrence, we embed the full sequence distribution as
a tensor in the product Hilbert space. A generative process is then defined as
maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) gradient flow in the space of sequences. To
overcome challenges with large tensors and slow sampling convergence, we
introduce spectral mean flows, a novel tractable algorithm integrating two core
concepts. First, we propose a new neural architecture by leveraging spectral
decomposition of linear operators to derive a scalable tensor network
decomposition of sequence mean embeddings. Second, we extend MMD gradient flows
to time-dependent Hilbert spaces and connect them to flow matching via the
continuity equation, enabling simulation-free learning and faster sampling. We
demonstrate competitive results on a range of time-series modeling datasets.

Abstract: While behavior cloning with flow/diffusion policies excels at learning
complex skills from demonstrations, it remains vulnerable to distributional
shift, and standard RL methods struggle to fine-tune these models due to their
iterative inference process and the limitations of existing workarounds. In
this work, we introduce the Stepwise Flow Policy (SWFP) framework, founded on
the key insight that discretizing the flow matching inference process via a
fixed-step Euler scheme inherently aligns it with the variational
Jordan-Kinderlehrer-Otto (JKO) principle from optimal transport. SWFP
decomposes the global flow into a sequence of small, incremental
transformations between proximate distributions. Each step corresponds to a JKO
update, regularizing policy changes to stay near the previous iterate and
ensuring stable online adaptation with entropic regularization. This
decomposition yields an efficient algorithm that fine-tunes pre-trained flows
via a cascade of small flow blocks, offering significant advantages:
simpler/faster training of sub-models, reduced computational/memory costs, and
provable stability grounded in Wasserstein trust regions. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate SWFP's enhanced stability, efficiency, and superior
adaptation performance across diverse robotic control benchmarks.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of ionic conductivity in electrolyte systems is crucial
for advancing numerous scientific and technological applications. While
significant progress has been made, current research faces two fundamental
challenges: (1) the lack of high-quality standardized benchmarks, and (2)
inadequate modeling of geometric structure and intermolecular interactions in
mixture systems. To address these limitations, we first reorganize and enhance
the CALiSol and DiffMix electrolyte datasets by incorporating geometric graph
representations of molecules. We then propose GeoMix, a novel geometry-aware
framework that preserves Set-SE(3) equivariance-an essential but challenging
property for mixture systems. At the heart of GeoMix lies the Geometric
Interaction Network (GIN), an equivariant module specifically designed for
intermolecular geometric message passing. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate
that GeoMix consistently outperforms diverse baselines (including MLPs, GNNs,
and geometric GNNs) across both datasets, validating the importance of
cross-molecular geometric interactions and equivariant message passing for
accurate property prediction. This work not only establishes new benchmarks for
electrolyte research but also provides a general geometric learning framework
that advances modeling of mixture systems in energy materials, pharmaceutical
development, and beyond.

Abstract: Real-time forecasting from streaming data poses critical challenges: handling
non-stationary dynamics, operating under strict computational limits, and
adapting rapidly without catastrophic forgetting. However, many existing
approaches face trade-offs between accuracy, adaptability, and efficiency,
particularly when deployed in constrained computing environments. We introduce
WORK-DMD (Windowed Online Random Kernel Dynamic Mode Decomposition), a method
that combines Random Fourier Features with online Dynamic Mode Decomposition to
capture nonlinear dynamics through explicit feature mapping, while preserving
fixed computational cost and competitive predictive accuracy across evolving
data. WORK-DMD employs Sherman-Morrison updates within rolling windows,
enabling continuous adaptation to evolving dynamics from only current data,
eliminating the need for lengthy training or large storage requirements for
historical data. Experiments on benchmark datasets across several domains show
that WORK-DMD achieves higher accuracy than several state-of-the-art online
forecasting methods, while requiring only a single pass through the data and
demonstrating particularly strong performance in short-term forecasting. Our
results show that combining kernel evaluations with adaptive matrix updates
achieves strong predictive performance with minimal data requirements. This
sample efficiency offers a practical alternative to deep learning for streaming
forecasting applications.

Conclusion: 基于通用逼近定理的闭式Transformer公式不仅解释了'深度信念'，还为设计高效Transformer架构开辟了新途径。

Abstract: The widespread 'deeper is better' philosophy has driven the creation of
architectures like ResNet and Transformer, which achieve high performance by
stacking numerous layers. However, increasing model depth comes with challenges
such as longer training times, higher inference latency, and impracticality on
resource-constrained devices. To address these issues, we propose ParaFormer, a
shallow Transformer architecture designed for true parallelism in both
structure and computation. By formulating standard Transformers as function
approximators in closed-form, our theoretical analysis shows that their
performance relies on inter-layer collaboration for progressive approximation,
rather than depth itself. While deep Transformers enforce this collaboration
through sequential designs, we demonstrate that such collaboration is not
inherently tied to sequential structures. ParaFormer removes the sequential
constraint by organizing layers into parallel branches, enforcing inter-layer
collaboration algorithmically. Specifically, we implement progressive
approximation, ensuring that each new branch further reduces the loss from
preceding branches, enabling faster convergence. Extensive experiments validate
ParaFormer's effectiveness, outperforming standard Transformers like ViT.
Moreover, ParaFormer supports up to 15.07x model compression and facilitates
model expansion for adaptive continuous learning. Experimental results on
multi-GPU deployment demonstrate that ParaFormer is 3.30x faster than widely
used parallelism solutions such as FairScale. These advancements stem from our
closed-form formulation of Transformers based on the Universal Approximation
Theorem, which not only explains the ``depth belief'' but also opens new
avenues for designing efficient Transformer architectures. Source code:

Abstract: This dissertation investigates how reinforcement learning (RL) methods can be
designed to be safe, sample-efficient, and robust. Framed through the unifying
perspective of contextual-bandit RL, the work addresses two major application
domains - ranking and recommendation, and text-to-image diffusion models. The
first part of the thesis develops theory and algorithms for safe deployment in
ranking systems. An exposure-based generalisation bound is derived, leading to
a counterfactual risk-minimisation objective whose solution is guaranteed not
to underperform the logging policy, even with sparse feedback. This guarantee
is extended to doubly robust estimators, enabling safety even under adversarial
or misspecified user models and offering practitioners explicit control over
permissible utility loss. The second part turns to single-action bandits, where
various off-policy estimators are unified within a baseline-correction
framework. A closed-form optimal baseline is proposed and shown to minimise
both evaluation and policy-gradient variance, thereby improving off-policy
learning reliability. The final part examines the trade-offs between efficiency
and effectiveness in generative RL. A systematic study of PPO and REINFORCE

TL;DR: 本文提出了首个基于置信度估计的理论框架来分析基于采样的测试时缩放方法，揭示了自一致性和困惑度方法的局限性，并提出了RPC混合方法来解决这些问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管基于采样的测试时缩放方法在实践中取得了成功，但其理论基础尚未得到充分探索。本文旨在填补这一空白，为这类方法提供理论分析框架。

Method: 提出了RPC混合方法，包含两个关键组件：困惑度一致性（结合自一致性和困惑度的优势）和推理剪枝（消除低概率推理路径）。

Result: 在七个基准数据集上的实证结果表明，RPC在保持与自一致性相当的推理性能的同时，不仅提高了置信度可靠性，还将采样成本降低了50%。

Conclusion: RPC方法通过理论指导的混合策略，有效解决了现有方法的局限性，在减少推理错误方面展现出强大潜力。

Abstract: Test-time scaling seeks to improve the reasoning performance of large
language models (LLMs) by adding computational resources. A prevalent approach
within the field is sampling-based test-time scaling methods, which enhance
reasoning by generating multiple reasoning paths for a given input during
inference. However, despite its practical success, the theoretical foundations
remain underexplored. In this paper, we provide the first theoretical framework
for analyzing sampling-based test-time scaling methods, grounded in the
perspective of confidence estimation. Based on the framework, we analyze two
dominant paradigms: self-consistency and perplexity, and reveal key
limitations: self-consistency suffers from high estimation error while
perplexity exhibits substantial modeling error and possible degradation of the
estimation error convergence. To address these limitations, we introduce RPC, a
hybrid method that leverages our theoretical insights through two key
components: Perplexity Consistency and Reasoning Pruning. Perplexity
Consistency combines the strengths of self-consistency and perplexity, boosting
the convergence rate of estimation error from linear to exponential while
preserving model error. Reasoning Pruning prevents degradation by eliminating
low-probability reasoning paths. Both theoretical analysis and empirical
results across seven benchmark datasets demonstrate that RPC has a strong
potential for reducing reasoning error. Notably, RPC achieves reasoning
performance comparable to self-consistency while not only enhancing confidence
reliability but also reducing sampling costs by 50%. The code and resources are

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于鞍点问题的潜变量能量基模型训练方法，通过耦合Wasserstein梯度流实现最大似然训练，无需判别器或辅助网络。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 潜变量能量基模型能够同时进行生成建模和捕获隐藏结构，但传统训练方法存在局限性。本文旨在开发更有效的训练算法，避免使用判别器或辅助网络。

Method: 将最大似然训练重新表述为潜变量和联合流形分布上的鞍点问题，使用耦合Wasserstein梯度流进行内部更新，交替执行过阻尼Langevin更新和随机参数上升。

Result: 在标准平滑性和耗散性假设下证明了存在性和收敛性，在KL散度和Wasserstein-2距离上获得衰减率。在物理系统数值逼近上表现优异，与可比方法竞争。

Conclusion: 提出的鞍点视角提供了比受限摊销后验更紧的ELBO，为潜变量能量基模型训练提供了理论保证和实用算法。

Abstract: Latent-variable energy-based models (LVEBMs) assign a single normalized
energy to joint pairs of observed data and latent variables, offering
expressive generative modeling while capturing hidden structure. We recast
maximum-likelihood training as a saddle problem over distributions on the
latent and joint manifolds and view the inner updates as coupled Wasserstein
gradient flows. The resulting algorithm alternates overdamped Langevin updates
for a joint negative pool and for conditional latent particles with stochastic
parameter ascent, requiring no discriminator or auxiliary networks. We prove
existence and convergence under standard smoothness and dissipativity
assumptions, with decay rates in KL divergence and Wasserstein-2 distance. The
saddle-point view further yields an ELBO strictly tighter than bounds obtained
with restricted amortized posteriors. Our method is evaluated on numerical
approximations of physical systems and performs competitively against
comparable approaches.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms struggle with learning optimal
policies for tasks where reward feedback is sparse and depends on a complex
sequence of events in the environment. Probabilistic reward machines (PRMs) are
finite-state formalisms that can capture temporal dependencies in the reward
signal, along with nondeterministic task outcomes. While special RL algorithms
can exploit this finite-state structure to expedite learning, PRMs remain
difficult to modify and design by hand. This hinders the already difficult
tasks of utilizing high-level causal knowledge about the environment, and
transferring the reward formalism into a new domain with a different causal
structure. This paper proposes a novel method to incorporate causal information
in the form of Temporal Logic-based Causal Diagrams into the reward formalism,
thereby expediting policy learning and aiding the transfer of task
specifications to new environments. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical
result about convergence to optimal policy for our method, and demonstrate its
strengths empirically.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法假设演示者属于低复杂度策略类，但本文认为奖励模型（指定哪些答案正确）属于低基数类是更弱的假设，在这种假设下最大似然方法可能失败。

Method: 将问题形式化为上下文多臂老虎机中的离线模仿学习，提出了一种基于奖励模型低基数假设的新方法，学习复杂度与奖励类基数呈对数关系。

Result: 证明了最大似然方法在奖励模型低基数假设下可能失败，而新方法能够以对数复杂度学习。

Conclusion: 当从正确演示中学习时，应该超越最大似然估计方法，考虑基于奖励模型低基数假设的替代方法。

Abstract: We study the problem of learning to generate an answer (or completion) to a
question (or prompt), where there could be multiple correct answers, any one of
which is acceptable at test time. Learning is based on demonstrations of some
correct answer to each training question, as in Supervised Fine Tuning (SFT).
We formalize the problem as offline imitation learning in contextual bandits,
with demonstrations from some optimal policy, without explicitly observed
rewards. Prior work assumes that the demonstrator belongs to a low-complexity
policy class, which motivates maximum likelihood estimation (i.e., log-loss
minimization). In contrast, we propose relying only on the reward model
(specifying which answers are correct) being in a low-cardinality class, which
we argue is a weaker assumption. We show that likelihood maximization methods
can fail in this case, and instead devise an alternative novel approach that
learns with sample complexity logarithmic in the cardinality of the reward
class. Our work motivates looking beyond likelihood maximization when learning
from correct demonstrations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在存在分配偏差的情况下进行反事实预测的问题，传统对抗训练方法存在训练不稳定和调参负担重的缺点。

Method: 从连接反事实-事实风险差距与互信息的理论边界出发，学习预测结果的随机表示Z，同时最小化I(Z;T)。推导出可处理的变分目标，将信息项上界与监督解码器耦合。

Result: 在受控数值模拟和真实世界临床数据集上的评估表明，该方法在似然度、反事实误差和政策评估等指标上表现优于现有平衡、重加权和对抗基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了稳定且理论动机明确的训练准则，避免了对抗方案的训练不稳定性和调参负担，在动态设置中也能自然扩展。

Abstract: We study counterfactual prediction under assignment bias and propose a
mathematically grounded, information-theoretic approach that removes
treatment-covariate dependence without adversarial training. Starting from a
bound that links the counterfactual-factual risk gap to mutual information, we
learn a stochastic representation Z that is predictive of outcomes while
minimizing I(Z; T). We derive a tractable variational objective that
upper-bounds the information term and couples it with a supervised decoder,
yielding a stable, provably motivated training criterion. The framework extends
naturally to dynamic settings by applying the information penalty to sequential
representations at each decision time. We evaluate the method on controlled
numerical simulations and a real-world clinical dataset, comparing against
recent state-of-the-art balancing, reweighting, and adversarial baselines.
Across metrics of likelihood, counterfactual error, and policy evaluation, our
approach performs favorably while avoiding the training instabilities and
tuning burden of adversarial schemes.

Motivation: 传统强化学习需要开发模拟器和手动定义奖励函数，这通常耗时耗力。OffSim旨在直接从专家轨迹中学习环境动态和奖励结构，减少人工成本。

Method: 联合优化高熵转移模型和IRL奖励函数，增强探索性和奖励泛化能力。OffSim+扩展版本引入边际奖励以处理多数据集设置。

Conclusion: OffSim框架能够直接从专家轨迹中学习环境动态和奖励函数，实现无需真实环境交互的策略训练，在离线IRL任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning algorithms typically utilize an interactive simulator
(i.e., environment) with a predefined reward function for policy training.
Developing such simulators and manually defining reward functions, however, is
often time-consuming and labor-intensive. To address this, we propose an
Offline Simulator (OffSim), a novel model-based offline inverse reinforcement
learning (IRL) framework, to emulate environmental dynamics and reward
structure directly from expert-generated state-action trajectories. OffSim
jointly optimizes a high-entropy transition model and an IRL-based reward
function to enhance exploration and improve the generalizability of the learned
reward. Leveraging these learned components, OffSim can subsequently train a
policy offline without further interaction with the real environment.
Additionally, we introduce OffSim$^+$, an extension that incorporates a
marginal reward for multi-dataset settings to enhance exploration. Extensive
MuJoCo experiments demonstrate that OffSim achieves substantial performance
gains over existing offline IRL methods, confirming its efficacy and
robustness.

TL;DR: 提出了SESA（顺序采样）框架，通过顺序生成多样化的解决方案草图来缓解强化学习中探索不足和熵崩溃问题，提升LLMs的推理多样性和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习在提升大语言模型推理能力时存在探索有限和熵崩溃问题，模型倾向于利用狭窄的解决方案集，导致采样多样性丧失，阻碍性能进一步改进。

Method: SESA框架通过顺序采样方法，在扩展为完整推理路径之前先顺序生成多样化的解决方案草图，每个新输出都基于前一个输出进行条件生成，从而在整个过程中促进多样性。

Result: 在合成任务中，顺序采样在路径多样性和从崩溃中恢复方面始终优于传统RL方法。在三个智能体基准测试中，SESA将成功率分别提升了+0.25、+0.42和+0.07绝对点（相对于基线RL最高达211%的相对改进）。

Conclusion: SESA为探索提供了一种结构化方法，为RL训练的大语言模型实现更有效和多样化的推理铺平了道路。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has been pivotal in enhancing the reasoning
capabilities of large language models (LLMs), but it often suffers from limited
exploration and entropy collapse, where models exploit a narrow set of
solutions, leading to a loss of sampling diversity and subsequently preventing
RL from further improving performance. This issue is exacerbated in parallel
sampling methods, where multiple outputs are drawn from the same distribution,
potentially causing the model to converge to similar solutions. We propose
SESA, a novel SEquential SAmpling framework that mitigates this challenge by
generating diverse solution sketches sequentially before expanding them into
full reasoning paths. This approach ensures broader exploration by conditioning
each new output on previous ones, promoting diversity throughout the process
and preventing policy collapse. Our experiments on a synthetic task show that
sequential sampling consistently outperforms traditional RL methods in terms of
path diversity and recovery from collapse. Further evaluations on real-world
tasks demonstrate that SESA improves both the exploration of valid strategies
and the overall performance of LLMs. On three agent benchmarks, SESA lifts
success rates by $+0.25$, $+0.42$, and $+0.07$ absolute over the base model (up
to an additional $211\%$ relative improvement over baseline RL), underscoring
its exploration advantage. This work introduces a structured approach to
exploration, paving the way for more effective and diverse reasoning in
RL-trained LLMs. Our code is released at https://github.com/MuLabPKU/sesa.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CLIP及其变体未能充分利用点互信息(PMI)的线性结构，而理论研究表明跨模态相似度应与PMI对应。

Method: 在再生核希尔伯特空间中使用内积来近似PMI，理论上可以任意精度逼近PMI。

Result: 在多个检索和分类任务中，KME-CLIP整体优于标准CLIP方法。

Conclusion: 通过利用PMI的线性结构，KME-CLIP有效改进了多模态对比预训练框架的相似度计算机制。

Abstract: In this study, we propose an enhancement to the similarity computation
mechanism in multi-modal contrastive pretraining frameworks such as CLIP. Prior
theoretical research has demonstrated that the optimal similarity metrics
between paired modalities should correspond to the pointwise mutual information
(PMI) between the two modalities. However, the current implementations of CLIP
and its variants fail to fully utilize the underlying linear structure of PMI.
We therefore propose KME-CLIP, which leverages this structure through the inner
product in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. We theoretically prove that our
method can approximate PMI with arbitrary accuracy and empirically demonstrate
that our approach overall outperforms the standard CLIP formulation across
several retrieval and classification tasks.

Motivation: 挑战Transformer组件（如非线性激活和归一化）本质上是非单射的传统观点，证明语言模型实际上具有单射性，这对透明度、可解释性和安全部署有重要意义。

Method: 首先数学证明Transformer语言模型在初始化和训练过程中保持单射性；其次在六个最先进语言模型上进行数十亿次碰撞测试；最后提出SipIt算法，可证明高效地从隐藏激活重建输入文本。

Result: 数学证明和实证测试均表明Transformer语言模型是单射的，没有观察到碰撞；SipIt算法在实践中实现了精确可逆性，具有线性时间保证。

Conclusion: 单射性是语言模型的基本且可利用的特性，对模型透明度、可解释性和安全部署具有直接意义。

Abstract: Transformer components such as non-linear activations and normalization are
inherently non-injective, suggesting that different inputs could map to the
same output and prevent exact recovery of the input from a model's
representations. In this paper, we challenge this view. First, we prove
mathematically that transformer language models mapping discrete input
sequences to their corresponding sequence of continuous representations are
injective and therefore lossless, a property established at initialization and
preserved during training. Second, we confirm this result empirically through
billions of collision tests on six state-of-the-art language models, and
observe no collisions. Third, we operationalize injectivity: we introduce
SipIt, the first algorithm that provably and efficiently reconstructs the exact
input text from hidden activations, establishing linear-time guarantees and
demonstrating exact invertibility in practice. Overall, our work establishes
injectivity as a fundamental and exploitable property of language models, with
direct implications for transparency, interpretability, and safe deployment.

Conclusion: 数据集大小可能是理解蒸馏机制的一个基本但被忽视的变量，蒸馏在数据稀缺时具有显著优势。

Abstract: The concept of knowledge distillation (KD) describes the training of a
student model from a teacher model and is a widely adopted technique in deep
learning. However, it is still not clear how and why distillation works.
Previous studies focus on two central aspects of distillation: model size, and
generalisation. In this work we study distillation in a third dimension:
dataset size. We present a suite of experiments across a wide range of
datasets, tasks and neural architectures, demonstrating that the effect of
distillation is not only preserved but amplified in low-data regimes. We call
this newly discovered property the data efficiency of distillation. Equipped
with this new perspective, we test the predictive power of existing theories of
KD as we vary the dataset size. Our results disprove the hypothesis that
distillation can be understood as label smoothing, and provide further evidence
in support of the dark knowledge hypothesis. Finally, we analyse the impact of
modelling factors such as the objective, scale and relative number of samples
on the observed phenomenon. Ultimately, this work reveals that the dataset size
may be a fundamental but overlooked variable in the mechanisms underpinning
distillation.

Motivation: 虽然MC Dropout被广泛用于估计模型不确定性，但其在识别分割错误（特别是肿瘤边界附近）方面的有效性尚不清楚，这对于医学图像分割至关重要。

Method: 使用U-Net在四种数据增强设置（无增强、水平翻转、旋转、缩放）下进行2D脑肿瘤MRI分割，通过50次随机前向传播计算不确定性，并使用Pearson和Spearman系数将不确定性与像素级误差相关联。

Result: 结果显示全局相关性较弱（r≈0.30-0.38），边界相关性可忽略（|r|<0.05）。虽然不同增强设置间的差异具有统计显著性（p<0.001），但缺乏实际意义。

Conclusion: MC Dropout不确定性在边界错误定位方面提供的线索有限，强调了在医学图像分割中需要替代或混合不确定性估计方法。

Abstract: Accurate brain tumor segmentation from MRI is vital for diagnosis and
treatment planning. Although Monte Carlo (MC) Dropout is widely used to
estimate model uncertainty, its effectiveness in identifying segmentation
errors -- especially near tumor boundaries -- remains unclear. This study
empirically examines the relationship between MC Dropout--based uncertainty and
segmentation error in 2D brain tumor MRI segmentation using a U-Net trained
under four augmentation settings: none, horizontal flip, rotation, and scaling.
Uncertainty was computed from 50 stochastic forward passes and correlated with
pixel-wise errors using Pearson and Spearman coefficients. Results show weak
global correlations ($r \approx 0.30$--$0.38$) and negligible boundary
correlations ($|r| < 0.05$). Although differences across augmentations were
statistically significant ($p < 0.001$), they lacked practical relevance. These
findings suggest that MC Dropout uncertainty provides limited cues for boundary
error localization, underscoring the need for alternative or hybrid uncertainty
estimation methods in medical image segmentation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解特征学习是建立深度神经网络数学基础的重要开放问题。神经特征假设(NFA)描述了训练后第一层权重Gram矩阵与输入梯度外积平均值(AGOP)的关系，需要进一步验证其在不同网络架构中的适用性。

Method: 采用梯度流动力学和平衡权重初始化假设，理论分析L层线性网络中NFA的成立条件。通过数值实验验证理论结果，涵盖多种优化算法、权重衰减率和初始化方案。

Result: 证明了在L≥2层线性网络中，NFA成立且指数α=1/L，显示了深度依赖性。对于非平衡初始化，若应用权重衰减，NFA渐近成立。同时发现某些非线性激活网络架构中NFA不成立，即使网络能很好拟合训练数据。

Conclusion: NFA在深度线性网络中具有理论保证，其指数与网络深度相关。权重衰减有助于在非平衡初始化下实现NFA。但NFA不适用于所有网络架构，特别是在非线性激活情况下。

Abstract: Understanding feature learning is an important open question in establishing
a mathematical foundation for deep neural networks. The Neural Feature Ansatz
(NFA) states that after training, the Gram matrix of the first-layer weights of
a deep neural network is proportional to some power $\alpha>0$ of the average
gradient outer product (AGOP) of this network with respect to its inputs.
Assuming gradient flow dynamics with balanced weight initialization, the NFA
was proven to hold throughout training for two-layer linear networks with
exponent $\alpha = 1/2$ (Radhakrishnan et al., 2024). We extend this result to
networks with $L \geq 2$ layers, showing that the NFA holds with exponent
$\alpha = 1/L$, thus demonstrating a depth dependency of the NFA. Furthermore,
we prove that for unbalanced initialization, the NFA holds asymptotically
through training if weight decay is applied. We also provide counterexamples
showing that the NFA does not hold for some network architectures with
nonlinear activations, even when these networks fit arbitrarily well the
training data. We thoroughly validate our theoretical results through numerical
experiments across a variety of optimization algorithms, weight decay rates and
initialization schemes.

Abstract: We propose an Attention Enhanced Join-Graph Neural Networks(Attn-JGNN) model

Inspired by the Iterative Join Graph Propagation (IJGP) algorithm, Attn-JGNN
uses tree decomposition to encode the CNF formula into a join-graph, then
performs iterative message passing on the join-graph, and finally approximates
the model number by learning partition functions. In order to further improve
the accuracy of the solution, we apply the attention mechanism in and between
clusters of the join-graphs, which makes Attn-JGNN pay more attention to the
key variables and clusters in probabilistic inference, and reduces the
redundant calculation. Finally, our experiments show that our Attn-JGNN model
achieves better results than other neural network methods.

Method: 基于相对排序而非精确分数的观察，利用序列级稀疏性进行渐进式聚类剪枝，采用双层级滑动窗口和分块执行策略优化内存使用。

Result: 在0.6B到8B参数的reranker上测试，GRATING在微基准测试中延迟降低达89.0%，峰值内存降低达94.9%；在三个真实应用中延迟降低11.6%-51.0%，内存降低18.6%-77.8%。

Conclusion: GRATING系统在不损失精度的情况下，显著提升了语义top-K选择任务的效率和部署可行性。

Abstract: Semantic top-K selection with cross-encoder rerankers underpins of on-device
AI services, such as retrieval-augmented generation, agent memory, and
personalized recommendation. However, its latency and memory demands dominate
end-to-end budgets on edge hardware. Revisiting the objective of top-K
selection, we reveal that only relative rankings matter, not exact
per-candidate scores. We further observe sequence-level sparsity: relative
rankings stabilize early in intermediate layers, allowing pruning opportunities
prior to completing full inference.
  Building on this insight, we propose monolithic forwarding and develop a
training-free inference system, GRATING. By maintaining a global view of all
candidates, it reduces latency through progressive cluster pruning. It also
bounds peak memory usage by strategically overlapping I/O with computation via
dual-layer sliding window and chunked execution. We evaluate GRATING against
state-of-the-art baselines on rerankers from 0.6B to 8B parameters across Apple
M2 and RTX 5070. GRATING consistently reduces latency by up to 89.0% and peak
memory by up to 94.9% in microbenchmarks, without any loss in precision. Across
three real-world on-device AI applications, GRATING lowers latency by
11.6%-51.0% and peak memory by 18.6%-77.8%, demonstrating substantial
improvements in efficiency and deployability.

*Parsa Abbasi,Stefan Heindorf*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了CQD-SHAP框架，使用Shapley值计算复杂查询中各部分对答案排名的贡献，提高神经符号复杂查询回答的可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经符号复杂查询回答方法虽然可追踪中间结果，但无法解释查询不同部分的重要性，这会影响用户信任。

Method: 基于合作博弈论中的Shapley值，计算查询各部分对特定答案排名的贡献，满足所有基本Shapley公理。

Result: 在必要性和充分性解释的自动评估中，与多种基线方法比较，显示该方法对大多数查询类型有效。

Conclusion: CQD-SHAP能够解释神经预测器从不完整知识图谱中推断新知识的价值，而不仅仅是依赖图谱中现有事实的符号方法。

Abstract: Complex query answering (CQA) goes beyond the well-studied link prediction
task by addressing more sophisticated queries that require multi-hop reasoning
over incomplete knowledge graphs (KGs). Research on neural and neurosymbolic
CQA methods is still an emerging field. Almost all of these methods can be
regarded as black-box models, which may raise concerns about user trust.
Although neurosymbolic approaches like CQD are slightly more interpretable,
allowing intermediate results to be tracked, the importance of different parts
of the query remains unexplained. In this paper, we propose CQD-SHAP, a novel
framework that computes the contribution of each query part to the ranking of a
specific answer. This contribution explains the value of leveraging a neural
predictor that can infer new knowledge from an incomplete KG, rather than a
symbolic approach relying solely on existing facts in the KG. CQD-SHAP is
formulated based on Shapley values from cooperative game theory and satisfies
all the fundamental Shapley axioms. Automated evaluation of these explanations
in terms of necessary and sufficient explanations, and comparisons with various
baselines, shows the effectiveness of this approach for most query types.

TL;DR: 提出了NODE-ONet框架，结合神经常微分方程和算子学习，通过物理编码增强PDE求解的泛化能力和数值效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有算子学习方法忽略PDE的领域知识，在捕捉时间动态和训练时间范围外的泛化方面存在挑战

Method: 采用编码器-解码器架构：空间离散化编码器、捕捉潜在时间动态的神经ODE、物理空间重建解码器，并提出物理编码神经ODE

Conclusion: 该框架具有适应不同编码器/解码器的灵活性，能够跨相关PDE族泛化，是科学机器学习中可扩展的物理编码工具

Abstract: Operator learning has emerged as a promising paradigm for developing
efficient surrogate models to solve partial differential equations (PDEs).
However, existing approaches often overlook the domain knowledge inherent in
the underlying PDEs and hence suffer from challenges in capturing temporal
dynamics and generalization issues beyond training time frames. This paper
introduces a deep neural ordinary differential equation (ODE) operator network
framework, termed NODE-ONet, to alleviate these limitations. The framework
adopts an encoder-decoder architecture comprising three core components: an
encoder that spatially discretizes input functions, a neural ODE capturing
latent temporal dynamics, and a decoder reconstructing solutions in physical
spaces. Theoretically, error analysis for the encoder-decoder architecture is
investigated. Computationally, we propose novel physics-encoded neural ODEs to
incorporate PDE-specific physical properties. Such well-designed neural ODEs
significantly reduce the framework's complexity while enhancing numerical
efficiency, robustness, applicability, and generalization capacity. Numerical
experiments on nonlinear diffusion-reaction and Navier-Stokes equations
demonstrate high accuracy, computational efficiency, and prediction
capabilities beyond training time frames. Additionally, the framework's
flexibility to accommodate diverse encoders/decoders and its ability to
generalize across related PDE families further underscore its potential as a
scalable, physics-encoded tool for scientific machine learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种高效的Tsetlin机器软件实现，通过位运算、提前退出机制和文字重排序策略，在ARM处理器上实现高达96.71%的推理时间减少。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tsetlin机器在资源受限设备上具有高速推理潜力，其逻辑驱动操作适合现代CPU架构的并行执行，因此需要优化实现来充分发挥其性能。

Method: 1) 使用指令级位运算进行紧凑模型表示和加速处理；2) 引入基于AND子句评估的提前退出机制；3) 提出文字重排序策略以最大化提前退出概率；4) 在训练后、推理前阶段通过统计分析实现重排序。

Result: 在ARM处理器上的gem5模拟器实验表明，优化实现相比传统基于整数的TM实现减少了高达96.71%的推理时间，同时保持相当的代码密度。

Conclusion: 所提出的优化技术显著提升了Tsetlin机器的推理性能，使其更适合在资源受限设备上部署，同时保持了模型的紧凑性。

Abstract: The Tsetlin Machine (TM) offers high-speed inference on resource-constrained
devices such as CPUs. Its logic-driven operations naturally lend themselves to
parallel execution on modern CPU architectures. Motivated by this, we propose
an efficient software implementation of the TM by leveraging instruction-level
bitwise operations for compact model representation and accelerated processing.
To further improve inference speed, we introduce an early exit mechanism, which
exploits the TM's AND-based clause evaluation to avoid unnecessary
computations. Building upon this, we propose a literal Reorder strategy
designed to maximize the likelihood of early exits. This strategy is applied
during a post-training, pre-inference stage through statistical analysis of all
literals and the corresponding actions of their associated Tsetlin Automata
(TA), introducing negligible runtime overhead. Experimental results using the
gem5 simulator with an ARM processor show that our optimized implementation
reduces inference time by up to 96.71% compared to the conventional
integer-based TM implementations while maintaining comparable code density.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有乘法自由模型如DLGNs在训练时计算成本高，且难以扩展到更多输入的逻辑块，需要更高效的梯度学习方法。

Method: 使用Walsh-Assisted Relaxation for Probabilistic Look-Up Tables (WARP-LUTs)方法，通过概率查找表和Walsh变换辅助，减少可训练参数数量。

Result: 在CIFAR-10数据集上，WARP-LUTs比DLGNs收敛速度显著更快，同时保持可比精度。

Conclusion: WARP-LUTs为高效逻辑门学习提供了有前景的方法，具有扩展到更高输入逻辑块的潜力，适用于FPGA部署和实时科学应用。

Abstract: Fast and efficient machine learning is of growing interest to the scientific
community and has spurred significant research into novel model architectures
and hardware-aware design. Recent hard? and software co-design approaches have
demonstrated impressive results with entirely multiplication-free models.
Differentiable Logic Gate Networks (DLGNs), for instance, provide a
gradient-based framework for learning optimal combinations of low-level logic
gates, setting state-of-the-art trade-offs between accuracy, resource usage,
and latency. However, these models suffer from high computational cost during
training and do not generalize well to logic blocks with more inputs. In this
work, we introduce Walsh-Assisted Relaxation for Probabilistic Look-Up Tables
(WARP-LUTs) - a novel gradient-based method that efficiently learns
combinations of logic gates with substantially fewer trainable parameters. We
demonstrate that WARP-LUTs achieve significantly faster convergence on CIFAR-10
compared to DLGNs, while maintaining comparable accuracy. Furthermore, our
approach suggests potential for extension to higher-input logic blocks,
motivating future research on extremely efficient deployment on modern FPGAs
and its real-time science applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CarBoN是一个测试时校准框架，通过自适应调整模型参数来提升推理任务性能，相比传统Best-of-N采样方法更高效，能在更少采样次数下达到相同或更高的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统测试时缩放方法如Best-of-N采样存在效率递减问题，随着N增大回报逐渐减少，需要更高效的方法来提升语言模型在推理任务中的表现。

Method: 提出CarBoN两阶段方法：首先探索解空间，然后通过学习输入特定的温度T和加性偏移向量δ来校准logits，引导生成更可靠的推理路径。

Result: 在MATH-500和AIME-2024上的实验显示，CarBoN效率提升显著，达到相同准确率所需采样次数减少4倍，且在固定预算下通常获得更高准确率。

Conclusion: CarBoN框架有效解决了测试时缩放效率问题，T和δ在平衡输出多样性和正确性方面发挥互补作用，该框架还可推广到束搜索等步骤级采样策略。

Abstract: Allocating more computation during inference time (test-time scaling)
improves language model performance, especially for reasoning tasks. However,
popular methods like Best-of-$N$ sampling often show diminishing returns as $N$
increases. To address this inefficiency, we introduce a general test-time
calibration framework that adaptively modifies the model toward high-reward
reasoning paths, with theoretical guarantees of improving the lower bound of
expected reward under finite sampling, all without large language model (LLM)
retraining. Within this framework, we propose CarBoN (Calibrated Best-of-$N$),
a two-phase method that first explores the solution space and then learns a
calibration of the logits via an input-specific temperature $T$ and additive
shift vector $\delta$, guiding generation toward more reliable reasoning.
Experiments on MATH-500 and AIME-2024 show that CarBoN improves efficiency,
with up to $4\times$ fewer rollouts to reach the same accuracy, while often
achieving higher accuracy under fixed budgets. We also analyze the
complementary roles of $T$ and $\delta$ in balancing output diversity and
correctness, and demonstrate that the framework also generalizes to step-level
sampling strategies such as beam search. For more information, please refer to

Motivation: 传统使用有限元法分析IPMSM转子形状计算成本高，需要开发更快速、成本更低的替代方法。

Method: 使用机器学习方法，开发自定义深度学习模型KS-Net，并与Cubic SVM、Quadratic SVM、Fine KNN、Cosine KNN、Fine Tree等算法比较，在包含9000个样本的平衡数据集上采用10折交叉验证。

Result: Cubic SVM和Quadratic SVM算法完美分类所有样本，准确率100%；KS-Net模型准确率99.98%，仅有两个误分类；所有方法都表现出色。

Conclusion: 数据驱动方法可以高精度预测IPMSM转子形状，为电机设计过程提供快速、经济高效的替代方案，并为自动化转子识别系统和数据驱动故障诊断奠定基础。

Abstract: The demand for high efficiency and precise control in electric drive systems
has led to the widespread adoption of Interior Permanent Magnet Synchronous
Motors (IPMSMs). The performance of these motors is significantly influenced by
rotor geometry. Traditionally, rotor shape analysis has been conducted using
the finite element method (FEM), which involves high computational costs. This
study aims to classify the rotor shape (2D type, V type, Nabla type) of IPMSMs
using electromagnetic parameters through machine learning-based methods and to
demonstrate the applicability of this approach as an alternative to classical
methods. In this context, a custom deep learning model, KS-Net, developed by
the user, was comparatively evaluated against Cubic SVM, Quadratic SVM, Fine
KNN, Cosine KNN, and Fine Tree algorithms. The balanced dataset, consisting of
9,000 samples, was tested using 10-fold cross-validation, and performance
metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were employed. The
results indicate that the Cubic SVM and Quadratic SVM algorithms classified all
samples flawlessly, achieving 100% accuracy, while the KS-Net model achieved
99.98% accuracy with only two misclassifications, demonstrating competitiveness
with classical methods. This study shows that the rotor shape of IPMSMs can be
predicted with high accuracy using data-driven approaches, offering a fast and
cost-effective alternative to FEM-based analyses. The findings provide a solid
foundation for accelerating motor design processes, developing automated rotor
identification systems, and enabling data-driven fault diagnosis in engineering
applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有通用对抗扰动方法忽略了领域特定的特征关系约束，导致生成的对抗样本不真实或易被检测，限制了实际应用。

Method: 提出CAP算法，基于增强拉格朗日最小最大优化框架，使用梯度交替优化策略来强制多个复杂约束条件。

Result: 在金融、IT网络和网络物理系统等多个领域评估显示，CAP实现了更高的攻击成功率，同时显著减少了运行时间。

Conclusion: CAP方法有效解决了约束特征空间中的对抗攻击问题，并提出了从数据中学习特征约束的原则性方法，具有广泛的适用性。

Abstract: Deep neural networks have achieved remarkable success in a wide range of
classification tasks. However, they remain highly susceptible to adversarial
examples - inputs that are subtly perturbed to induce misclassification while
appearing unchanged to humans. Among various attack strategies, Universal
Adversarial Perturbations (UAPs) have emerged as a powerful tool for both
stress testing model robustness and facilitating scalable adversarial training.
Despite their effectiveness, most existing UAP methods neglect domain specific
constraints that govern feature relationships. Violating such constraints, such
as debt to income ratios in credit scoring or packet flow invariants in network
communication, can render adversarial examples implausible or easily
detectable, thereby limiting their real world applicability.
  In this work, we advance universal adversarial attacks to constrained feature
spaces by formulating an augmented Lagrangian based min max optimization
problem that enforces multiple, potentially complex constraints of varying
importance. We propose Constrained Adversarial Perturbation (CAP), an efficient
algorithm that solves this problem using a gradient based alternating
optimization strategy. We evaluate CAP across diverse domains including
finance, IT networks, and cyber physical systems, and demonstrate that it
achieves higher attack success rates while significantly reducing runtime
compared to existing baselines. Our approach also generalizes seamlessly to
individual adversarial perturbations, where we observe similar strong
performance gains. Finally, we introduce a principled procedure for learning
feature constraints directly from data, enabling broad applicability across
domains with structured input spaces.

TL;DR: ProofOptimizer是一个通过专家迭代和强化学习训练的语言模型，专门用于简化Lean证明，无需人工监督，能显著压缩证明长度并提高验证效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前神经网络定理证明生成的证明过于冗长，难以被人理解，限制了数学洞察力。证明简化是关键瓶颈，但训练数据稀缺，现有方法难以处理RL训练证明器生成的极长证明。

Method: 通过专家迭代和强化学习训练ProofOptimizer模型，使用Lean验证简化并提供训练信号，在推理时采用迭代证明缩短工作流程。

Result: 在标准基准测试中，ProofOptimizer显著压缩了证明长度：miniF2F减少87%，PutnamBench减少57%，Seed-Prover的IMO 2025证明减少49%。简化后的证明在Lean中检查更快，且作为训练数据能进一步提升下游证明器性能。

Conclusion: ProofOptimizer是首个无需人工监督就能简化Lean证明的语言模型，能有效解决证明冗长问题，提高证明的可理解性和实用性。

Abstract: Neural theorem proving has advanced rapidly in the past year, reaching IMO
gold-medalist capabilities and producing formal proofs that span thousands of
lines. Although such proofs are mechanically verified by formal systems like
Lean, their excessive length renders them difficult for humans to comprehend
and limits their usefulness for mathematical insight. Proof simplification is
therefore a critical bottleneck. Yet, training data for this task is scarce,
and existing methods -- mainly agentic scaffolding with off-the-shelf LLMs --
struggle with the extremely long proofs generated by RL-trained provers. We
introduce ProofOptimizer, the first language model trained to simplify Lean
proofs without requiring additional human supervision. ProofOptimizer is
trained via expert iteration and reinforcement learning, using Lean to verify
simplifications and provide training signal. At inference time, it operates
within an iterative proof-shortening workflow, progressively reducing proof
length. Experiments show that ProofOptimizer substantially compresses proofs
generated by state-of-the-art RL-trained provers on standard benchmarks,
reducing proof length by 87% on miniF2F, 57% on PutnamBench, and 49% on
Seed-Prover's IMO 2025 proofs. Beyond conciseness, the simplified proofs check
faster in Lean and further improve downstream prover performance when reused as
training data for supervised finetuning.

Motivation: 开发既能最优执行又提供正式安全保证的强化学习系统，解决RL部署中的安全问题。

Method: 将约束MDP状态空间增强风险预算，使用学习到的成本评论家对策略分布应用屏蔽，确保采样动作在期望意义下安全。

Result: 在确定性环境中保持最优性，提供仅依赖备份评论家准确度的成本期望紧上界，实验显示在训练时也能保证安全。

Conclusion: ProSh在模型无关设置下提供形式化安全保证，即使在训练阶段也能确保安全性，且不影响最优性能。

Abstract: Safety is a major concern in reinforcement learning (RL): we aim at
developing RL systems that not only perform optimally, but are also safe to
deploy by providing formal guarantees about their safety. To this end, we
introduce Probabilistic Shielding via Risk Augmentation (ProSh), a model-free
algorithm for safe reinforcement learning under cost constraints. ProSh
augments the Constrained MDP state space with a risk budget and enforces safety
by applying a shield to the agent's policy distribution using a learned cost
critic. The shield ensures that all sampled actions remain safe in expectation.
We also show that optimality is preserved when the environment is
deterministic. Since ProSh is model-free, safety during training depends on the
knowledge we have acquired about the environment. We provide a tight
upper-bound on the cost in expectation, depending only on the backup-critic
accuracy, that is always satisfied during training. Under mild, practically
achievable assumptions, ProSh guarantees safety even at training time, as shown
in the experiments.

Motivation: 传统强化学习方法在处理具有复杂历史依赖奖励结构的环境时面临挑战，需要手动设计奖励函数，这既困难又低效。

Method: 使用确定性有限自动机(DFA)生成轨迹偏好来学习奖励函数，包括静态方法（直接使用学习到的奖励函数进行策略优化）和动态方法（通过迭代更新持续优化奖励函数和策略）。

Result: 在离散和连续环境中的实验表明，该方法能够学习处理时间依赖性任务的有效策略，优于传统的奖励工程和基于自动机的基线方法。

Conclusion: 基于自动机的偏好方法在处理非马尔可夫奖励方面具有优势，提供了可扩展、高效且无需人工干预的奖励建模替代方案，并具有收敛性保证。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) in environments with complex, history-dependent
reward structures poses significant challenges for traditional methods. In this
work, we introduce a novel approach that leverages automaton-based feedback to
guide the learning process, replacing explicit reward functions with
preferences derived from a deterministic finite automaton (DFA). Unlike
conventional approaches that use automata for direct reward specification, our
method employs the structure of the DFA to generate preferences over
trajectories that are used to learn a reward function, eliminating the need for
manual reward engineering. Our framework introduces a static approach that uses
the learned reward function directly for policy optimization and a dynamic
approach that involves continuous refining of the reward function and policy
through iterative updates until convergence.
  Our experiments in both discrete and continuous environments demonstrate that
our approach enables the RL agent to learn effective policies for tasks with
temporal dependencies, outperforming traditional reward engineering and
automaton-based baselines such as reward machines and LTL-guided methods. Our
results highlight the advantages of automaton-based preferences in handling
non-Markovian rewards, offering a scalable, efficient, and human-independent
alternative to traditional reward modeling. We also provide a convergence
guarantee showing that under standard assumptions our automaton-guided
preference-based framework learns a policy that is near-optimal with respect to
the true non-Markovian objective.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 有限元分析计算成本高，不适合设计优化问题，需要寻找深度学习模型作为替代方案，但选择合适的架构来准确模拟FEA是一个挑战。

Method: 采用图神经网络(GNN)和3D U-Net作为FEA替代模型，引入基于Navier-Cauchy方程的物理信息神经网络(PINN)框架，使用课程学习策略（先在数据上预训练，再进行物理信息微调）。

Result: GNN明显优于U-Net，最差的GCN框架相对L2误差为8.7%，而最好的U-Net为13.0%。MPNN和Graph Transformer精度最高，相对L2误差分别为3.5%和2.6%。PINN显著提高了泛化能力，在高信号任务上误差降低达11.3%。

Conclusion: 虽然Graph Transformer最准确，但推理速度比第二好的MPNN PINN慢37.5%。PINN增强的MPNN提供了最实用的解决方案，在预测性能、模型大小和推理速度之间取得了良好平衡。

Abstract: Although Finite Element Analysis (FEA) is an integral part of the product
design lifecycle, the analysis is computationally expensive, making it
unsuitable for many design optimization problems. The deep learning models can
be a great solution. However, selecting the architecture that emulates the FEA
with great accuracy is a challenge. This paper presents a comprehensive
evaluation of graph neural networks (GNNs) and 3D U-Nets as surrogates for FEA
of parametric I-beams. We introduce a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN)
framework, governed by the Navier Cauchy equations, to enforce physical laws.
Crucially, we demonstrate that a curriculum learning strategy, pretraining on
data followed by physics informed fine tuning, is essential for stabilizing
training. Our results show that GNNs fundamentally outperform the U-Net. Even
the worst performer among GNNs, the GCN framework, achieved a relative L2 error
of 8.7% while the best framework among U Net, U Net with attention mechanism
trained on high resolution data, achieved 13.0% score. Among the graph-based
architectures, the Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNN) and Graph
Transformers achieved the highest accuracy, achieving a relative L2 score of
3.5% and 2.6% respectively. The inclusion of physics fundamental laws (PINN)
significantly improved the generalization, reducing error by up to 11.3% on
high-signal tasks. While the Graph Transformer is the most accurate model, it
is more 37.5% slower during inference when compared to second best model, MPNN
PINN. The PINN enhanced MPNN (MPNN PINN) provides the most practical solution.
It offers a good compromise between predictive performance, model size, and
inference speed.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有持续学习方法大多关注减轻遗忘和提高准确率，但忽视了网络校准这一关键方面。神经崩溃现象在持续学习中显示出优势，但很少有工作专门改进持续学习模型的校准以提供更可靠的预测。

Method: 提出Sphere-Adaptive Mixup (SAMix)，一种针对神经崩溃方法定制的自适应混合策略。该方法根据神经崩溃下特征空间的几何特性调整混合过程，确保更稳健的正则化和对齐。

Conclusion: SAMix是持续学习系统稳健性的有前景的进展，能够同时增强校准和性能，减少过度自信、减轻遗忘并提高准确率。

Abstract: While most continual learning methods focus on mitigating forgetting and
improving accuracy, they often overlook the critical aspect of network
calibration, despite its importance. Neural collapse, a phenomenon where
last-layer features collapse to their class means, has demonstrated advantages
in continual learning by reducing feature-classifier misalignment. Few works
aim to improve the calibration of continual models for more reliable
predictions. Our work goes a step further by proposing a novel method that not
only enhances calibration but also improves performance by reducing
overconfidence, mitigating forgetting, and increasing accuracy. We introduce
Sphere-Adaptive Mixup (SAMix), an adaptive mixup strategy tailored for neural
collapse-based methods. SAMix adapts the mixing process to the geometric
properties of feature spaces under neural collapse, ensuring more robust

Abstract: Poultry farming faces increasing pressure to meet productivity targets while
ensuring animal welfare and environmental compliance. Yet many small and
medium-sized farms lack affordable, integrated tools for continuous monitoring
and decision-making, relying instead on manual, reactive inspections. This
paper presents Poultry Farm Intelligence (PoultryFI) - a modular,
cost-effective platform that integrates six AI-powered modules: Camera
Placement Optimizer, Audio-Visual Monitoring, Analytics & Alerting, Real-Time
Egg Counting, Production & Profitability Forecasting, and a Recommendation
Module.
  Camera layouts are first optimized offline using evolutionary algorithms for
full poultry house coverage with minimal hardware. The Audio-Visual Monitoring
module extracts welfare indicators from synchronized video, audio, and feeding
data. Analytics & Alerting produces daily summaries and real-time
notifications, while Real-Time Egg Counting uses an edge vision model to
automate production tracking. Forecasting models predict egg yield and feed
consumption up to 10 days in advance, and the Recommendation Module integrates
forecasts with weather data to guide environmental and operational adjustments.
  This is among the first systems to combine low-cost sensing, edge analytics,
and prescriptive AI to continuously monitor flocks, predict production, and
optimize performance. Field trials demonstrate 100% egg-count accuracy on
Raspberry Pi 5, robust anomaly detection, and reliable short-term forecasting.
PoultryFI bridges the gap between isolated pilot tools and scalable, farm-wide
intelligence, empowering producers to proactively safeguard welfare and
profitability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的预训练时间序列模型主要关注单变量预测，限制了在现实世界多变量数据和协变量场景中的适用性。

Method: 采用组注意力机制促进跨多个时间序列的上下文学习，通过在合成数据集上训练来获得通用能力，这些数据集对单变量序列施加了多样化的多变量结构。

Result: 在fev-bench、GIFT-Eval和Chronos Benchmark II三个基准测试中达到最先进性能，特别是在多变量和协变量预测任务上显著优于现有模型。

Conclusion: Chronos-2的上下文学习能力使其成为通用预测模型，可以直接用于现实世界预测流程中。

Abstract: Pretrained time series models have enabled inference-only forecasting systems
that produce accurate predictions without task-specific training. However,
existing approaches largely focus on univariate forecasting, limiting their
applicability in real-world scenarios where multivariate data and covariates
play a crucial role. We present Chronos-2, a pretrained model capable of
handling univariate, multivariate, and covariate-informed forecasting tasks in
a zero-shot manner. Chronos-2 employs a group attention mechanism that
facilitates in-context learning (ICL) through efficient information sharing
across multiple time series within a group, which may represent sets of related
series, variates of a multivariate series, or targets and covariates in a
forecasting task. These general capabilities are achieved through training on
synthetic datasets that impose diverse multivariate structures on univariate
series. Chronos-2 delivers state-of-the-art performance across three
comprehensive benchmarks: fev-bench, GIFT-Eval, and Chronos Benchmark II. On
fev-bench, which emphasizes multivariate and covariate-informed forecasting,
Chronos-2's universal ICL capabilities lead to substantial improvements over
existing models. On tasks involving covariates, it consistently outperforms
baselines by a wide margin. Case studies in the energy and retail domains
further highlight its practical advantages. The in-context learning
capabilities of Chronos-2 establish it as a general-purpose forecasting model
that can be used "as is" in real-world forecasting pipelines.

TL;DR: 论文提出SNOO优化器，通过将Nesterov动量应用于Lookahead优化器的伪梯度，在非分布式设置中实现了1.5-2.5倍的计算效率提升，且改进效果随模型规模增大而增强。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DiLoCo优化器在非分布式设置中表现优异，研究发现其有效性主要源于对伪梯度应用Nesterov动量，因此希望开发一种专门针对非分布式环境的优化方法。

Method: 提出Step-K Nesterov Outer Optimizer (SNOO)，在Lookahead双循环框架中，对内部优化器生成的伪梯度应用Nesterov动量来更新慢权重。

Result: SNOO在非分布式设置中实现了1.5-2.5倍的计算效率提升，训练FLOPs规模可达1e23，且改进效果随模型规模增大而增强。

Conclusion: SNOO因其最小的计算和内存开销以及与模型分片的兼容性，成为各种内部优化器（包括AdamW和Muon）的实用增强方法。

Abstract: The rapid development of large language models (LLMs) has driven the demand
for more efficient optimization techniques. Among these, the Lookahead family
of optimizers employs a two-loop framework, maintaining fast and slow sets of
model weights. Multiple inner optimizer steps on the fast weights produce a
trajectory - the pseudo-gradient - that is used to update the slow weights.
DiLoCo, a notable example originally designed for distributed training, applies
Nesterov momentum to the averaged pseudo-gradient from multiple workers,
claiming to even outperform AdamW in a non-distributed setup. In this paper, we
empirically show that DiLoCo's surprising effectiveness stems primarily from
applying Nesterov momentum to the pseudo-gradient, which improves training in a
non-distributed setting. We call this Lookahead variant the Step-$K$ Nesterov
Outer Optimizer (SNOO). We demonstrate that SNOO achieves compute factor gains
of 1.5 - 2.5$\times$ in a non-distributed setting up to a scale of 1e23
training FLOPs, with improvements that increase with model size. Because of its
minimal compute and memory overhead and compatibility with model sharding, SNOO
is a practical enhancement for a variety of inner optimizers, including AdamW
and Muon.

Abstract: Quantum computing has the potential to revolutionize fields like quantum
optimization and quantum machine learning. However, current quantum devices are
hindered by noise, reducing their reliability. A key challenge in gate-based
quantum computing is improving the reliability of quantum circuits, measured by
process fidelity, during the transpilation process, particularly in the routing
stage. In this paper, we address the Fidelity Maximization in Routing Stage
(FMRS) problem by introducing FIDDLE, a novel learning framework comprising two
modules: a Gaussian Process-based surrogate model to estimate process fidelity
with limited training samples and a reinforcement learning module to optimize
routing. Our approach is the first to directly maximize process fidelity,
outperforming traditional methods that rely on indirect metrics such as circuit
depth or gate count. We rigorously evaluate FIDDLE by comparing it with
state-of-the-art fidelity estimation techniques and routing optimization
methods. The results demonstrate that our proposed surrogate model is able to
provide a better estimation on the process fidelity compared to existing
learning techniques, and our end-to-end framework significantly improves the
process fidelity of quantum circuits across various noise models.

Conclusion: TRON提供了一种生物学基础和可解释的跨物种迁移学习方法，为更有效利用转录组数据铺平道路。

Abstract: We present Transfer Orthology Networks (TRON), a novel neural network
architecture designed for cross-species transfer learning. TRON leverages
orthologous relationships, represented as a bipartite graph between species, to
guide knowledge transfer. Specifically, we prepend a learned species conversion
layer, whose weights are masked by the biadjacency matrix of this bipartite
graph, to a pre-trained feedforward neural network that predicts a phenotype
from gene expression data in a source species. This allows for efficient
transfer of knowledge to a target species by learning a linear transformation
that maps gene expression from the source to the target species' gene space.
The learned weights of this conversion layer offer a potential avenue for
interpreting functional orthology, providing insights into how genes across
species contribute to the phenotype of interest. TRON offers a biologically
grounded and interpretable approach to cross-species transfer learning, paving
the way for more effective utilization of available transcriptomic data. We are
in the process of collecting cross-species transcriptomic/phenotypic data to
gain experimental validation of the TRON architecture.

Abstract: Random Utility Models (RUMs) are a classical framework for modeling user
preferences and play a key role in reward modeling for Reinforcement Learning
from Human Feedback (RLHF). However, a crucial shortcoming of many of these
techniques is the Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives (IIA) assumption,
which collapses \emph{all} human preferences to a universal underlying utility
function, yielding a coarse approximation of the range of human preferences. On
the other hand, statistical and computational guarantees for models avoiding
this assumption are scarce. In this paper, we investigate the statistical and
computational challenges of learning a \emph{correlated} probit model, a
fundamental RUM that avoids the IIA assumption. First, we establish that the
classical data collection paradigm of pairwise preference data is
\emph{fundamentally insufficient} to learn correlational information,
explaining the lack of statistical and computational guarantees in this
setting. Next, we demonstrate that \emph{best-of-three} preference data
provably overcomes these shortcomings, and devise a statistically and
computationally efficient estimator with near-optimal performance. These
results highlight the benefits of higher-order preference data in learning
correlated utilities, allowing for more fine-grained modeling of human
preferences. Finally, we validate these theoretical guarantees on several
real-world datasets, demonstrating improved personalization of human
preferences.

Abstract: Recent research has shown that optimization proxies can be trained to high
fidelity, achieving average optimality gaps under 1% for large-scale problems.
However, worst-case analyses show that there exist in-distribution queries that
result in orders of magnitude higher optimality gap, making it difficult to
trust the predictions in practice. This paper aims at striking a balance
between classical solvers and optimization proxies in order to enable
trustworthy deployments with interpretable speed-optimality tradeoffs based on
a user-defined optimality threshold. To this end, the paper proposes a hybrid
solver that leverages duality theory to efficiently bound the optimality gap of
predictions, falling back to a classical solver for queries where optimality
cannot be certified. To improve the achieved speedup of the hybrid solver, the
paper proposes an alternative training procedure that combines the primal and
dual proxy training. Experiments on large-scale transmission systems show that
the hybrid solver is highly scalable. The proposed hybrid solver achieves
speedups of over 1000x compared to a parallelized simplex-based solver while
guaranteeing a maximum optimality gap of 2%.
