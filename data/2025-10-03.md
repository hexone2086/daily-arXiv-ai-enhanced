### [1] [LVTINO: LAtent Video consisTency INverse sOlver for High Definition Video Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01339)
*Alessio Spagnoletti,Andrés Almansa,Marcelo Pereyra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了LVTINO，首个基于视频一致性模型的零样本高分辨率视频修复方法，解决了帧间应用图像扩散模型导致的时间不一致性问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于图像扩散模型的零样本图像逆求解器在视频修复中表现不佳，因为需要同时恢复精细空间细节和捕捉微妙的时间依赖性，简单的逐帧应用会导致时间不一致的重建结果

Method: 利用视频一致性模型(VCMs)作为先验，构建LVTINO零样本逆求解器，通过条件机制绕过自动微分需求，仅需少量神经网络评估即可实现高质量视频重建

Result: 在多种视频逆问题上进行了广泛实验，相比当前最先进的逐帧图像LDM方法，在重建保真度和计算效率方面都取得了显著感知改进

Conclusion: LVTINO建立了视频重建质量和计算效率的新基准，确保了强测量一致性和帧间平滑时间过渡

Abstract: Computational imaging methods increasingly rely on powerful generative
diffusion models to tackle challenging image restoration tasks. In particular,
state-of-the-art zero-shot image inverse solvers leverage distilled
text-to-image latent diffusion models (LDMs) to achieve unprecedented accuracy
and perceptual quality with high computational efficiency. However, extending
these advances to high-definition video restoration remains a significant
challenge, due to the need to recover fine spatial detail while capturing
subtle temporal dependencies. Consequently, methods that naively apply
image-based LDM priors on a frame-by-frame basis often result in temporally
inconsistent reconstructions. We address this challenge by leveraging recent
advances in Video Consistency Models (VCMs), which distill video latent
diffusion models into fast generators that explicitly capture temporal
causality. Building on this foundation, we propose LVTINO, the first zero-shot
or plug-and-play inverse solver for high definition video restoration with
priors encoded by VCMs. Our conditioning mechanism bypasses the need for
automatic differentiation and achieves state-of-the-art video reconstruction
quality with only a few neural function evaluations, while ensuring strong
measurement consistency and smooth temporal transitions across frames.
Extensive experiments on a diverse set of video inverse problems show
significant perceptual improvements over current state-of-the-art methods that
apply image LDMs frame by frame, establishing a new benchmark in both
reconstruction fidelity and computational efficiency.

### [2] [Image Generation Based on Image Style Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01347)
*Shuochen Chang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于三阶段训练的风格提取图像生成方法，通过风格编码器和风格投影层将风格表示与文本表示对齐，实现基于文本提示的细粒度风格引导生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决文本到图像生成模型中细粒度风格难以用自然语言精确描述和控制的问题，以及风格参考图像的引导信息难以与传统文本引导生成对齐的挑战。

Method: 使用风格编码器和风格投影层提取单一风格参考图像的细粒度风格表示，在不改变下游生成模型结构框架的情况下注入风格表示，实现三阶段训练方法。

Result: 构建了Style30k-captions数据集（包含图像、风格标签和文本描述的三元组），成功训练了风格编码器和风格投影层。

Conclusion: 该方法能够最大化预训练生成模型的生成能力，实现细粒度控制的风格化图像生成，解决了风格表示与文本条件对齐的问题。

Abstract: Image generation based on text-to-image generation models is a task with
practical application scenarios that fine-grained styles cannot be precisely
described and controlled in natural language, while the guidance information of
stylized reference images is difficult to be directly aligned with the textual
conditions of traditional textual guidance generation. This study focuses on
how to maximize the generative capability of the pretrained generative model,
by obtaining fine-grained stylistic representations from a single given
stylistic reference image, and injecting the stylistic representations into the
generative body without changing the structural framework of the downstream
generative model, so as to achieve fine-grained controlled stylized image
generation. In this study, we propose a three-stage training style
extraction-based image generation method, which uses a style encoder and a
style projection layer to align the style representations with the textual
representations to realize fine-grained textual cue-based style guide
generation. In addition, this study constructs the Style30k-captions dataset,
whose samples contain a triad of images, style labels, and text descriptions,
to train the style encoder and style projection layer in this experiment.

### [3] [EvoStruggle: A Dataset Capturing the Evolution of Struggle across Activities and Skill Levels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01362)
*Shijia Feng,Michael Wray,Walterio Mayol-Cuevas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文收集了一个包含61.68小时视频、2,793个视频和5,385个标注时间段的挣扎检测数据集，用于研究技能学习过程中挣扎的演变。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有操作数据集未关注挣扎随时间的演变，而理解这种演变对于确定用户当前学习阶段和开发有效辅助系统至关重要。

Method: 收集了76名参与者执行18个任务的视频数据，任务分为四类活动：打结、折纸、七巧板和洗牌。参与者重复同一任务五次以捕捉技能演变。将挣扎检测定义为时间动作定位任务。

Result: 时间动作定位模型能够成功学习检测挣扎线索，在未见任务或活动上评估时，跨任务平均mAP为34.56%，跨活动为19.24%。

Conclusion: 挣扎是一个可跨各种基于技能任务转移的概念，但在挣扎检测方面仍需进一步改进。

Abstract: The ability to determine when a person struggles during skill acquisition is
crucial for both optimizing human learning and enabling the development of
effective assistive systems. As skills develop, the type and frequency of
struggles tend to change, and understanding this evolution is key to
determining the user's current stage of learning. However, existing
manipulation datasets have not focused on how struggle evolves over time. In
this work, we collect a dataset for struggle determination, featuring 61.68
hours of video recordings, 2,793 videos, and 5,385 annotated temporal struggle
segments collected from 76 participants. The dataset includes 18 tasks grouped
into four diverse activities -- tying knots, origami, tangram puzzles, and
shuffling cards, representing different task variations. In addition,
participants repeated the same task five times to capture their evolution of
skill. We define the struggle determination problem as a temporal action
localization task, focusing on identifying and precisely localizing struggle
segments with start and end times. Experimental results show that Temporal
Action Localization models can successfully learn to detect struggle cues, even
when evaluated on unseen tasks or activities. The models attain an overall
average mAP of 34.56% when generalizing across tasks and 19.24% across
activities, indicating that struggle is a transferable concept across various
skill-based tasks while still posing challenges for further improvement in
struggle detection. Our dataset is available at

### [4] [SPUS: A Lightweight and Parameter-Efficient Foundation Model for PDEs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01370)
*Abu Bucker Siddik,Diane Oyen,Alexander Most,Michal Kucer,Ayan Biswas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPUS是一个紧凑高效的偏微分方程求解基础模型，使用轻量级残差U-Net架构，通过自回归预训练策略学习物理规律，在多种PDE任务上实现最先进的泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PDE基础模型主要基于大型复杂Transformer架构，计算和参数开销高，需要开发更紧凑高效的统一神经算子。

Method: 采用轻量级残差U-Net架构，使用自回归预训练策略模拟数值求解器行为，在流体动力学PDE数据集上预训练。

Result: 在6个未见下游PDE任务上实现最先进的泛化性能，参数显著减少且仅需少量微调数据。

Conclusion: SPUS展示了作为参数高效基础模型解决多样化PDE系统的潜力，残差U-Net架构在该领域具有重要价值。

Abstract: We introduce Small PDE U-Net Solver (SPUS), a compact and efficient
foundation model (FM) designed as a unified neural operator for solving a wide
range of partial differential equations (PDEs). Unlike existing
state-of-the-art PDE FMs-primarily based on large complex transformer
architectures with high computational and parameter overhead-SPUS leverages a
lightweight residual U-Net-based architecture that has been largely
underexplored as a foundation model architecture in this domain. To enable
effective learning in this minimalist framework, we utilize a simple yet
powerful auto-regressive pretraining strategy which closely replicates the
behavior of numerical solvers to learn the underlying physics. SPUS is
pretrained on a diverse set of fluid dynamics PDEs and evaluated across 6
challenging unseen downstream PDEs spanning various physical systems.
Experimental results demonstrate that SPUS using residual U-Net based
architecture achieves state-of-the-art generalization on these downstream tasks
while requiring significantly fewer parameters and minimal fine-tuning data,
highlighting its potential as a highly parameter-efficient FM for solving
diverse PDE systems.

### [5] [DisCo: Reinforcement with Diversity Constraints for Multi-Human Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01399)
*Shubhankar Borse,Farzad Farhadzadeh,Munawar Hayat,Fatih Porikli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DisCo是一个基于强化学习的框架，通过多样性约束直接优化多人生成中的身份多样性，解决了文本到图像模型在多人提示下重复面部、合并身份和计数错误的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最先进的文本到图像模型在现实主义方面表现出色，但在多人生成提示下会崩溃 - 重复面部、合并身份和错误计数个体。

Method: DisCo通过组相对策略优化(GRPO)微调流匹配模型，使用组合奖励：(i)惩罚图像内面部相似性，(ii)阻止跨样本身份重复，(iii)强制准确的人数计数，(iv)通过人类偏好分数保持视觉保真度。单阶段课程稳定训练复杂度扩展，无需额外标注。

Result: 在DiverseHumans测试集上，DisCo实现了98.6%的独特面部准确率和接近完美的全局身份分布 - 超越开源和专有方法(如Gemini、GPT-Image)，同时保持竞争力的感知质量。

Conclusion: DisCo作为一个可扩展、无需标注的解决方案，解决了生成模型中长期存在的身份危机，并为组合多人生成设定了新的基准。

Abstract: State-of-the-art text-to-image models excel at realism but collapse on
multi-human prompts - duplicating faces, merging identities, and miscounting
individuals. We introduce DisCo (Reinforcement with Diversity Constraints), the
first RL-based framework to directly optimize identity diversity in multi-human
generation. DisCo fine-tunes flow-matching models via Group-Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) with a compositional reward that (i) penalizes intra-image
facial similarity, (ii) discourages cross-sample identity repetition, (iii)
enforces accurate person counts, and (iv) preserves visual fidelity through
human preference scores. A single-stage curriculum stabilizes training as
complexity scales, requiring no extra annotations. On the DiverseHumans
Testset, DisCo achieves 98.6 Unique Face Accuracy and near-perfect Global
Identity Spread - surpassing both open-source and proprietary methods (e.g.,
Gemini, GPT-Image) while maintaining competitive perceptual quality. Our
results establish DisCo as a scalable, annotation-free solution that resolves
the long-standing identity crisis in generative models and sets a new benchmark
for compositional multi-human generation.

### [6] [GeoSURGE: Geo-localization using Semantic Fusion with Hierarchy of Geographic Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01448)
*Angel Daruna,Nicholas Meegan,Han-Pang Chiu,Supun Samarasekera,Rakesh Kumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的视觉地理定位方法，通过将查询图像的视觉表示与学习的地理表示对齐，并构建层次化地理嵌入模型，在多个基准数据集上取得了显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉地理定位方法在学习地理表示方面仍有改进空间，需要更有效地将视觉内容与地理位置信息对齐。

Method: 构建层次化地理嵌入模型，将世界建模为地理嵌入的层次结构，并引入有效融合查询图像外观特征与其语义分割图的方法。

Result: 在5个基准数据集的25个指标中，22个指标超过了先前的最先进方法和大型视觉语言模型，创造了新的最佳性能。

Conclusion: 结合地理和视觉表示是性能提升的主要驱动力，证明了该方法在视觉地理定位任务中的有效性。

Abstract: Worldwide visual geo-localization seeks to determine the geographic location
of an image anywhere on Earth using only its visual content. Learned
representations of geography for visual geo-localization remain an active
research topic despite much progress. We formulate geo-localization as aligning
the visual representation of the query image with a learned geographic
representation. Our novel geographic representation explicitly models the world
as a hierarchy of geographic embeddings. Additionally, we introduce an approach
to efficiently fuse the appearance features of the query image with its
semantic segmentation map, forming a robust visual representation. Our main
experiments demonstrate improved all-time bests in 22 out of 25 metrics
measured across five benchmark datasets compared to prior state-of-the-art
(SOTA) methods and recent Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). Additional
ablation studies support the claim that these gains are primarily driven by the
combination of geographic and visual representations.

### [7] [Data Selection for Fine-tuning Vision Language Models via Cross Modal Alignment Trajectories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01454)
*Nilay Naharas,Dang Nguyen,Nesihan Bulut,Mohammadhossein Bateni,Vahab Mirrokni,Baharan Mirzasoleiman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: XMAS是一种针对大型视觉语言模型的数据高效指令调优方法，通过分析跨模态注意力矩阵的轨迹来聚类相似样本，从而在保持性能的同时大幅减少训练数据量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据选择方法在大型视觉语言模型上表现不佳，无法超越随机选择的效果，需要开发专门针对LVLMs的高效数据选择方法。

Method: 基于跨模态注意力矩阵相似性原理，通过聚类注意力矩阵的奇异值轨迹，从聚类中平衡采样来构建训练子集。

Result: XMAS能够丢弃LLaVA-665k数据集的50%和Vision-Flan数据集的85%，同时完全保持LLaVA-1.5-7B在10个下游基准测试中的性能，训练速度提升1.2倍。

Conclusion: XMAS是首个针对LVLMs的数据高效指令调优方法，通过注意力矩阵分析有效去除训练数据冗余，在保持性能的同时显著减少数据需求。

Abstract: Data-efficient learning aims to eliminate redundancy in large training
datasets by training models on smaller subsets of the most informative
examples. While data selection has been extensively explored for vision models
and large language models (LLMs), it remains underexplored for Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). Notably, none of existing methods can
outperform random selection at different subset sizes. In this work, we propose
the first principled method for data-efficient instruction tuning of LVLMs. We
prove that examples with similar cross-modal attention matrices during
instruction tuning have similar gradients. Thus, they influence model
parameters in a similar manner and convey the same information to the model
during training. Building on this insight, we propose XMAS, which clusters
examples based on the trajectories of the top singular values of their
attention matrices obtained from fine-tuning a small proxy LVLM. By sampling a
balanced subset from these clusters, XMAS effectively removes redundancy in
large-scale LVLM training data. Extensive experiments show that XMAS can
discard 50% of the LLaVA-665k dataset and 85% of the Vision-Flan dataset while
fully preserving performance of LLaVA-1.5-7B on 10 downstream benchmarks and
speeding up its training by 1.2x. This is 30% more data reduction compared to
the best baseline for LLaVA-665k. The project's website can be found at

### [8] [Purrception: Variational Flow Matching for Vector-Quantized Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01478)
*Răzvan-Andrei Matişan,Vincent Tao Hu,Grigory Bartosh,Björn Ommer,Cees G. M. Snoek,Max Welling,Jan-Willem van de Meent,Mohammad Mahdi Derakhshani,Floor Eijkelboom*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Purrception是一种用于向量量化图像生成的变分流匹配方法，通过在连续嵌入空间中学习速度场，同时提供明确的分类监督，结合了连续方法的几何感知和分类方法的离散监督优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的图像生成方法在连续传输和离散监督之间存在差距，Purrception旨在通过变分流匹配来弥合这一差距，在保持连续传输动态的同时提供明确的分类监督。

Method: 该方法将变分流匹配适应于向量量化潜在空间，通过学习码本索引的分类后验，同时在连续嵌入空间中计算速度场，实现了对合理代码的不确定性量化和温度控制的生成。

Result: 在ImageNet-1k 256x256生成任务上，Purrception比连续流匹配和离散流匹配基线收敛更快，同时达到了与最先进模型相当的FID分数。

Conclusion: 变分流匹配能够有效桥接连续传输和离散监督，提高图像生成的训练效率，为向量量化生成提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce Purrception, a variational flow matching approach for
vector-quantized image generation that provides explicit categorical
supervision while maintaining continuous transport dynamics. Our method adapts
Variational Flow Matching to vector-quantized latents by learning categorical
posteriors over codebook indices while computing velocity fields in the
continuous embedding space. This combines the geometric awareness of continuous
methods with the discrete supervision of categorical approaches, enabling
uncertainty quantification over plausible codes and temperature-controlled
generation. We evaluate Purrception on ImageNet-1k 256x256 generation. Training
converges faster than both continuous flow matching and discrete flow matching
baselines while achieving competitive FID scores with state-of-the-art models.
This demonstrates that Variational Flow Matching can effectively bridge
continuous transport and discrete supervision for improved training efficiency
in image generation.

### [9] [AortaDiff: A Unified Multitask Diffusion Framework For Contrast-Free AAA Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01498)
*Yuxuan Ou,Ning Bi,Jiazhen Pan,Jiancheng Yang,Boliang Yu,Usama Zidan,Regent Lee,Vicente Grau*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一个统一的深度学习框架，从非对比CT扫描生成合成对比增强CT图像，同时分割主动脉腔和血栓，通过条件扩散模型和多任务学习实现端到端联合优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统对比增强CT需要碘对比剂，存在肾毒性、过敏反应和环境危害等风险。现有方法采用多阶段流程，导致错误累积且无法利用共享的语义和解剖结构。

Method: 集成条件扩散模型与多任务学习，共享编码器和解码器参数，采用半监督训练策略处理缺失分割标签的数据，实现图像合成和分割的联合优化。

Result: 在264名患者队列中表现优异：图像合成PSNR达25.61 dB，优于单任务CDM的23.80 dB；分割方面，腔Dice分数提升至0.89，血栓Dice分数提升至0.53；临床测量更准确，腔直径MAE降至4.19 mm，血栓面积误差降至33.85%。

Conclusion: 该统一框架在减少对比剂使用的同时，通过联合优化显著提升了图像合成和分割性能，为临床实践提供了更安全有效的解决方案。

Abstract: While contrast-enhanced CT (CECT) is standard for assessing abdominal aortic
aneurysms (AAA), the required iodinated contrast agents pose significant risks,
including nephrotoxicity, patient allergies, and environmental harm. To reduce
contrast agent use, recent deep learning methods have focused on generating
synthetic CECT from non-contrast CT (NCCT) scans. However, most adopt a
multi-stage pipeline that first generates images and then performs
segmentation, which leads to error accumulation and fails to leverage shared
semantic and anatomical structures. To address this, we propose a unified deep
learning framework that generates synthetic CECT images from NCCT scans while
simultaneously segmenting the aortic lumen and thrombus. Our approach
integrates conditional diffusion models (CDM) with multi-task learning,
enabling end-to-end joint optimization of image synthesis and anatomical
segmentation. Unlike previous multitask diffusion models, our approach requires
no initial predictions (e.g., a coarse segmentation mask), shares both encoder
and decoder parameters across tasks, and employs a semi-supervised training
strategy to learn from scans with missing segmentation labels, a common
constraint in real-world clinical data. We evaluated our method on a cohort of
264 patients, where it consistently outperformed state-of-the-art single-task
and multi-stage models. For image synthesis, our model achieved a PSNR of 25.61
dB, compared to 23.80 dB from a single-task CDM. For anatomical segmentation,
it improved the lumen Dice score to 0.89 from 0.87 and the challenging thrombus
Dice score to 0.53 from 0.48 (nnU-Net). These segmentation enhancements led to
more accurate clinical measurements, reducing the lumen diameter MAE to 4.19 mm
from 5.78 mm and the thrombus area error to 33.85% from 41.45% when compared to
nnU-Net. Code is available at https://github.com/yuxuanou623/AortaDiff.git.

### [10] [From Videos to Indexed Knowledge Graphs -- Framework to Marry Methods for Multimodal Content Analysis and Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01513)
*Basem Rizk,Joel Walsh,Mark Core,Benjamin Nye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个用于多模态内容分析的高效原型框架，将视频转换为时间半结构化数据格式，并进一步翻译为可查询的知识图谱表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态内容分析复杂、计算昂贵且需要大量工程努力，现有预训练模型难以与视频等复杂数据融合。

Method: 设计候选管道配方，结合预训练模型将视频转换为时间半结构化数据，再翻译为帧级索引的知识图谱表示。

Result: 创建了支持查询和持续学习的知识图谱表示，能够通过交互方式动态整合新的领域特定知识。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了多模态内容分析中的工程挑战，提供了灵活且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Analysis of multi-modal content can be tricky, computationally expensive, and
require a significant amount of engineering efforts. Lots of work with
pre-trained models on static data is out there, yet fusing these opensource
models and methods with complex data such as videos is relatively challenging.
In this paper, we present a framework that enables efficiently prototyping
pipelines for multi-modal content analysis. We craft a candidate recipe for a
pipeline, marrying a set of pre-trained models, to convert videos into a
temporal semi-structured data format. We translate this structure further to a
frame-level indexed knowledge graph representation that is query-able and
supports continual learning, enabling the dynamic incorporation of new
domain-specific knowledge through an interactive medium.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WALT框架通过逆向工程将网站功能转化为可重用的工具，让网络代理直接调用search、filter等高级操作，而不是依赖脆弱的逐步UI交互，从而在浏览器自动化中实现更高效和鲁棒的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前网络代理方法依赖逐步UI交互和大量LLM推理，在动态布局和长任务中容易失效，而人类则利用网站提供的高级功能如搜索、筛选等操作。

Method: WALT框架逆向工程网站潜在功能，将其转化为可调用的工具，包括发现类（搜索、筛选、排序）、通信类（发布、评论、点赞）和内容管理类（创建、编辑、删除）工具。

Result: 在VisualWebArena和WebArena测试中，WALT以更少的步骤和更少的LLM依赖推理实现了更高的成功率。

Conclusion: WALT通过将计算负担从脆弱的逐步推理转移到可靠的工具调用，为浏览器自动化建立了鲁棒且可泛化的新范式。

Abstract: Web agents promise to automate complex browser tasks, but current methods
remain brittle -- relying on step-by-step UI interactions and heavy LLM
reasoning that break under dynamic layouts and long horizons. Humans, by
contrast, exploit website-provided functionality through high-level operations
like search, filter, and sort. We introduce WALT (Web Agents that Learn Tools),
a framework that reverse-engineers latent website functionality into reusable
invocable tools. Rather than hypothesizing ad-hoc skills, WALT exposes robust
implementations of automations already designed into websites -- spanning
discovery (search, filter, sort), communication (post, comment, upvote), and
content management (create, edit, delete). Tools abstract away low-level
execution: instead of reasoning about how to click and type, agents simply call
search(query) or create(listing). This shifts the computational burden from
fragile step-by-step reasoning to reliable tool invocation. On VisualWebArena
and WebArena, WALT achieves higher success with fewer steps and less
LLM-dependent reasoning, establishing a robust and generalizable paradigm for
browser automation.

*Meilong Xu,Xiaoling Hu,Shahira Abousamra,Chen Li,Chao Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种半监督分割框架，通过拓扑一致性机制来识别和保留有意义的语义结构，特别适用于密集分布的病理图像分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在半监督分割中，从未标记数据中捕捉有意义的语义结构至关重要，特别是在病理图像分析中，对象密集分布，这带来了挑战。

Method: 利用随机dropout和时间训练快照获得多个扰动预测，通过拓扑一致性机制确保这些不同输出之间的结构一致性，并引入结合空间重叠和全局结构对齐的新型匹配策略。

Result: 大量实验表明，该方法有效减少了拓扑错误，产生了更鲁棒和准确的分割结果。

Conclusion: 该方法为可靠的后续分析提供了更鲁棒和准确的分割结果，代码已开源。

Abstract: In semi-supervised segmentation, capturing meaningful semantic structures
from unlabeled data is essential. This is particularly challenging in
histopathology image analysis, where objects are densely distributed. To
address this issue, we propose a semi-supervised segmentation framework
designed to robustly identify and preserve relevant topological features. Our
method leverages multiple perturbed predictions obtained through stochastic
dropouts and temporal training snapshots, enforcing topological consistency
across these varied outputs. This consistency mechanism helps distinguish
biologically meaningful structures from transient and noisy artifacts. A key
challenge in this process is to accurately match the corresponding topological
features across the predictions in the absence of ground truth. To overcome
this, we introduce a novel matching strategy that integrates spatial overlap
with global structural alignment, minimizing discrepancies among predictions.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach effectively reduces
topological errors, resulting in more robust and accurate segmentations
essential for reliable downstream analysis. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Diffusion-LPO框架，通过列表式偏好优化来改进文本到图像扩散模型的对齐效果，利用排名信息提供比成对比较更精确的人类偏好信号。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DPO方法主要依赖成对偏好，但人类对图像的反馈通常包含隐含的排名信息，这些信息比成对比较能传达更精确的人类偏好。

Method: 基于Plackett-Luce模型推导了DPO目标的列表式扩展，给定一个标题，将用户反馈聚合成图像排名列表，通过鼓励每个样本优于其所有低排名替代品来在整个排名中保持一致性。

Result: 在文本到图像生成、图像编辑和个性化偏好对齐等任务中，Diffusion-LPO在视觉质量和偏好对齐方面始终优于成对DPO基线方法。

Conclusion: Diffusion-LPO是一个简单有效的列表式偏好优化框架，能够更好地利用人类反馈中的排名信息来对齐扩散模型与人类偏好。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has proven effectiveness
for aligning text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models with human preferences.
Although Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is widely adopted for its
computational efficiency and avoidance of explicit reward modeling, its
applications to diffusion models have primarily relied on pairwise preferences.
The precise optimization of listwise preferences remains largely unaddressed.
In practice, human feedback on image preferences often contains implicit ranked
information, which conveys more precise human preferences than pairwise
comparisons. In this work, we propose Diffusion-LPO, a simple and effective
framework for Listwise Preference Optimization in diffusion models with
listwise data. Given a caption, we aggregate user feedback into a ranked list
of images and derive a listwise extension of the DPO objective under the
Plackett-Luce model. Diffusion-LPO enforces consistency across the entire
ranking by encouraging each sample to be preferred over all of its lower-ranked
alternatives. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of Diffusion-LPO
across various tasks, including text-to-image generation, image editing, and
personalized preference alignment. Diffusion-LPO consistently outperforms
pairwise DPO baselines on visual quality and preference alignment.

TL;DR: Bridge是一个纯自回归的统一多模态大语言模型，通过混合Transformer架构和语义到像素的离散表示，在单一的下一个token预测框架中同时支持图像理解和生成，在减少训练数据和训练时间的同时，在理解和生成基准上取得了有竞争力的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 构建同时支持理解和生成的统一多模态大语言模型具有挑战性：混合方法破坏了自回归范式，而纯自回归方法在语义对齐和像素级保真度之间存在权衡。

Method: 通过混合Transformer架构增强预训练视觉理解模型的生成能力，并提出语义到像素的离散表示，将紧凑语义token与细粒度像素token相结合。

Result: 在多样化多模态基准测试中，Bridge在理解和生成基准上均取得了有竞争力或更优的结果，同时仅需增加7.9%的序列长度。

Conclusion: Bridge证明了在单一自回归框架内实现高质量多模态理解和生成的可行性，为构建更高效的多模态模型提供了新思路。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) extend the success of language
models to visual understanding, and recent efforts have sought to build unified
MLLMs that support both understanding and generation. However, constructing
such models remains challenging: hybrid approaches combine continuous
embeddings with diffusion or flow-based objectives, producing high-quality
images but breaking the autoregressive paradigm, while pure autoregressive
approaches unify text and image prediction over discrete visual tokens but
often face trade-offs between semantic alignment and pixel-level fidelity. In
this work, we present Bridge, a pure autoregressive unified MLLM that augments
pre-trained visual understanding models with generative ability through a
Mixture-of-Transformers architecture, enabling both image understanding and
generation within a single next-token prediction framework. To further improve
visual generation fidelity, we propose a semantic-to-pixel discrete
representation that integrates compact semantic tokens with fine-grained pixel
tokens, achieving strong language alignment and precise description of visual
details with only a 7.9% increase in sequence length. Extensive experiments
across diverse multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that Bridge achieves
competitive or superior results in both understanding and generation
benchmarks, while requiring less training data and reduced training time
compared to prior unified MLLMs.

TL;DR: 提出结合CNN与贝叶斯深度学习的混合模型，用于小样本口腔癌分类，通过不确定性量化提高模型可靠性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 口腔癌是全球高发癌症，早期诊断对降低死亡率至关重要。传统深度学习模型需要大数据集，在医疗资源匮乏地区难以实现，且存在过度自信和可靠性不足的问题。

Method: 使用卷积神经网络与贝叶斯深度学习相结合的混合模型，采用变分推理进行不确定性量化，在智能手机拍摄的彩色图像上进行训练。

Result: 在训练数据分布相似的测试集上达到94%准确率，与传统CNN相当；在现实世界图像数据上表现更优，达到88%准确率（传统CNN为72.94%）。置信度分析显示模型对正确分类样本置信度高，对错误分类样本置信度低。

Conclusion: 贝叶斯推理在数据稀缺环境下能有效提高口腔癌早期诊断的模型可靠性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Oral cancer ranks among the most prevalent cancers globally, with a
particularly high mortality rate in regions lacking adequate healthcare access.
Early diagnosis is crucial for reducing mortality; however, challenges persist
due to limited oral health programs, inadequate infrastructure, and a shortage
of healthcare practitioners. Conventional deep learning models, while
promising, often rely on point estimates, leading to overconfidence and reduced
reliability. Critically, these models require large datasets to mitigate
overfitting and ensure generalizability, an unrealistic demand in settings with
limited training data. To address these issues, we propose a hybrid model that
combines a convolutional neural network (CNN) with Bayesian deep learning for
oral cancer classification using small training sets. This approach employs
variational inference to enhance reliability through uncertainty
quantification. The model was trained on photographic color images captured by
smartphones and evaluated on three distinct test datasets. The proposed method
achieved 94% accuracy on a test dataset with a distribution similar to that of
the training data, comparable to traditional CNN performance. Notably, for
real-world photographic image data, despite limitations and variations
differing from the training dataset, the proposed model demonstrated superior
generalizability, achieving 88% accuracy on diverse datasets compared to 72.94%
for traditional CNNs, even with a smaller dataset. Confidence analysis revealed
that the model exhibits low uncertainty (high confidence) for correctly
classified samples and high uncertainty (low confidence) for misclassified
samples. These results underscore the effectiveness of Bayesian inference in
data-scarce environments in enhancing early oral cancer diagnosis by improving
model reliability and generalizability.

*Renrong Shao,Wei Zhang,Kangyang Luo,Qin Li,and Jun Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为CADTrans的无源域自适应方法，通过构建辅助域和一致性策略来获取不变特征表示，解决了现有方法在多样性表示不足和对困难样本敏感的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无源域自适应(SFDA)由于无法直接访问源域数据，难以获得确定性的不变特征。现有方法主要关注评估与源域相似的目标域不变特征，但容易受到困难样本和域偏差的影响。

Method: 开发了辅助域模块从中间聚合的全局注意力中获取多样化表示；通过多个一致性策略获取不变特征表示来区分简单和困难样本；构建条件多核最大均值差异(CMK-MMD)策略来对齐困难样本到相应的简单样本。

Result: 在Office-31、Office-Home、VISDA-C和DomainNet-126等多个基准数据集上进行了广泛实验，证明了所提出方法实现了显著的性能提升。

Conclusion: CADTrans通过构建辅助域和一致性策略有效解决了SFDA中的不变特征表示问题，在各种基准测试中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) aims to address the challenge of
adapting to a target domain without accessing the source domain directly.
However, due to the inaccessibility of source domain data, deterministic
invariable features cannot be obtained. Current mainstream methods primarily
focus on evaluating invariant features in the target domain that closely
resemble those in the source domain, subsequently aligning the target domain
with the source domain. However, these methods are susceptible to hard samples
and influenced by domain bias. In this paper, we propose a Consistent Assistant
Domains Transformer for SFDA, abbreviated as CADTrans, which solves the issue
by constructing invariable feature representations of domain consistency.
Concretely, we develop an assistant domain module for CADTrans to obtain
diversified representations from the intermediate aggregated global attentions,
which addresses the limitation of existing methods in adequately representing
diversity. Based on assistant and target domains, invariable feature
representations are obtained by multiple consistent strategies, which can be
used to distinguish easy and hard samples. Finally, to align the hard samples
to the corresponding easy samples, we construct a conditional multi-kernel max
mean discrepancy (CMK-MMD) strategy to distinguish between samples of the same
category and those of different categories. Extensive experiments are conducted
on various benchmarks such as Office-31, Office-Home, VISDA-C, and
DomainNet-126, proving the significant performance improvements achieved by our
proposed approaches. Code is available at

*Ricardo Gonzalez Penuela,Felipe Arias-Russi,Victor Capriles*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 开发了一个系统，利用BLV用户的历史视觉问题来指导多模态大语言模型生成更相关的图像描述，而不是默认的冗长描述。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的MLLM应用通常提供全面但冗长的描述，缺乏上下文相关性，导致BLV用户需要筛选大量无关信息来获取所需内容。

Method: 基于VizWiz-LF数据集中的历史BLV用户问题，当给定图像时识别相似的视觉上下文，并用相关问题指导MLLM生成更相关的描述。

Result: 评估显示，上下文感知描述在76.1%的情况下预判并回答了用户问题，在54.4%的比较中被优先选择。

Conclusion: 利用历史BLV用户问题指导MLLM可以生成更相关、更高效的图像描述，显著改善用户体验。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have been integrated into visual
interpretation applications to support Blind and Low Vision (BLV) users because
of their accuracy and ability to provide rich, human-like interpretations.
However, these applications often default to comprehensive, lengthy
descriptions regardless of context. This leads to inefficient exchanges, as
users must go through irrelevant details rather than receiving the specific
information they are likely to seek. To deliver more contextually-relevant
information, we developed a system that draws on historical BLV users
questions. When given an image, our system identifies similar past visual
contexts from the VizWiz-LF dataset and uses the associated questions to guide
the MLLM generate descriptions more relevant to BLV users. An evaluation with
three human labelers who revised 92 context-aware and context-free descriptions
showed that context-aware descriptions anticipated and answered users'
questions in 76.1% of cases (70 out of 92) and were preferred in 54.4% of
comparisons (50 out of 92). Our paper reviews, and data analysis are publicly

multimodal reasoning models. We capture the step-by-step reasoning process of
VLMs and the final descriptive answers. Our goal with this dataset is to enable
the development of more robust VLMs while contributing to the broader

Main category: cs.CV

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在解决成像逆问题时通常忽略感知矩阵零空间的特定结构，而NPN方法专门针对零空间设计先验，捕捉感知过程无法获取的信号信息。

Method: 使用神经网络构建感知矩阵零空间的低维投影，在该投影空间中寻找解，可与现有重建框架兼容，并补充传统图像域先验。

Result: 在压缩感知、去模糊、超分辨率、CT和MRI等多种成像逆问题中，NPN先验能持续提升重建保真度，适用于plug-and-play方法、展开网络、深度图像先验和扩散模型。

Conclusion: NPN方法通过关注零空间结构，提供了可解释且灵活的正则化方式，理论上保证收敛和重建精度，在实践中显著改善各种成像逆问题的重建效果。

Abstract: Imaging inverse problems aims to recover high-dimensional signals from
undersampled, noisy measurements, a fundamentally ill-posed task with infinite
solutions in the null-space of the sensing operator. To resolve this ambiguity,
prior information is typically incorporated through handcrafted regularizers or
learned models that constrain the solution space. However, these priors
typically ignore the task-specific structure of that null-space. In this work,
we propose \textit{Non-Linear Projections of the Null-Space} (NPN), a novel
class of regularization that, instead of enforcing structural constraints in
the image domain, promotes solutions that lie in a low-dimensional projection
of the sensing matrix's null-space with a neural network. Our approach has two
key advantages: (1) Interpretability: by focusing on the structure of the
null-space, we design sensing-matrix-specific priors that capture information
orthogonal to the signal components that are fundamentally blind to the sensing
process. (2) Flexibility: NPN is adaptable to various inverse problems,
compatible with existing reconstruction frameworks, and complementary to
conventional image-domain priors. We provide theoretical guarantees on
convergence and reconstruction accuracy when used within plug-and-play methods.
Empirical results across diverse sensing matrices demonstrate that NPN priors
consistently enhance reconstruction fidelity in various imaging inverse
problems, such as compressive sensing, deblurring, super-resolution, computed
tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging, with plug-and-play methods,
unrolling networks, deep image prior, and diffusion models.

Conclusion: 该工作为基因组医学中的机器人和临床自动化建立了可靠基础，通过可解释证据和成本感知推荐层提高决策效率和临床实用性。

Abstract: We propose an automated genomic interpretation module that transforms raw DNA
sequences into actionable, interpretable decisions suitable for integration
into medical automation and robotic systems. Our framework combines Chaos Game
Representation (CGR) with a Concept Bottleneck Model (CBM), enforcing
predictions to flow through biologically meaningful concepts such as GC
content, CpG density, and k mer motifs. To enhance reliability, we incorporate
concept fidelity supervision, prior consistency alignment, KL distribution
matching, and uncertainty calibration. Beyond accurate classification of HIV
subtypes across both in-house and LANL datasets, our module delivers
interpretable evidence that can be directly validated against biological
priors. A cost aware recommendation layer further translates predictive outputs
into decision policies that balance accuracy, calibration, and clinical
utility, reducing unnecessary retests and improving efficiency. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that the proposed system achieves state of the art
classification performance, superior concept prediction fidelity, and more
favorable cost benefit trade-offs compared to existing baselines. By bridging
the gap between interpretable genomic modeling and automated decision-making,
this work establishes a reliable foundation for robotic and clinical automation
in genomic medicine.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前VLA模型缺乏显式的逐步推理，不考虑可承受性约束或几何关系，后训练流程也很少强化推理质量。

Method: 提出RLVR后训练策略，设计可验证奖励用于区域对齐、轨迹一致性和输出格式化；开发VLA-CoT-13K数据集，提供与可承受性和轨迹标注明确对齐的思维链监督。

Result: 在领域内、领域外、仿真和真实机器人平台上的广泛评估显示，VLA-R1相比之前的VLA方法实现了更优越的泛化能力和真实世界性能。

Conclusion: VLA-R1通过系统优化推理和执行能力，显著提升了VLA模型的泛化性能和真实世界应用效果。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models aim to unify perception, language
understanding, and action generation, offering strong cross-task and
cross-scene generalization with broad impact on embodied AI. However, current
VLA models often lack explicit step-by-step reasoning, instead emitting final
actions without considering affordance constraints or geometric relations.
Their post-training pipelines also rarely reinforce reasoning quality, relying
primarily on supervised fine-tuning with weak reward design. To address these
challenges, we present VLA-R1, a reasoning-enhanced VLA that integrates
Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) with Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO) to systematically optimize both reasoning and
execution. Specifically, we design an RLVR-based post-training strategy with
verifiable rewards for region alignment, trajectory consistency, and output
formatting, thereby strengthening reasoning robustness and execution accuracy.
Moreover, we develop VLA-CoT-13K, a high-quality dataset that provides
chain-of-thought supervision explicitly aligned with affordance and trajectory
annotations. Furthermore, extensive evaluations on in-domain, out-of-domain,
simulation, and real-robot platforms demonstrate that VLA-R1 achieves superior
generalization and real-world performance compared to prior VLA methods. We
plan to release the model, code, and dataset following the publication of this
work. Code: https://github.com/GigaAI-research/VLA-R1. Website:

TL;DR: 提出了一种联合去模糊和3D重建的方法，用于解决微距摄影中的散焦模糊问题，通过可微分渲染自监督优化3D模型和散焦模糊核。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微距摄影中散焦模糊严重阻碍了清晰成像和高质量3D重建，传统方法需要大量图像和标注，且目前没有针对微距摄影的多视角3D重建方法。

Method: 从多视角模糊图像出发，联合优化物体的清晰3D模型和每个像素的散焦模糊核，采用可微分渲染方法进行自监督优化。

Result: 大量实验表明，从少量多视角图像中，该方法不仅能实现高质量图像去模糊，还能恢复高保真度的3D外观。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了微距摄影中的散焦模糊问题，实现了联合去模糊和3D重建。

Abstract: Macro lens has the advantages of high resolution and large magnification, and
3D modeling of small and detailed objects can provide richer information.
However, defocus blur in macrophotography is a long-standing problem that
heavily hinders the clear imaging of the captured objects and high-quality 3D
reconstruction of them. Traditional image deblurring methods require a large
number of images and annotations, and there is currently no multi-view 3D
reconstruction method for macrophotography. In this work, we propose a joint
deblurring and 3D reconstruction method for macrophotography. Starting from
multi-view blurry images captured, we jointly optimize the clear 3D model of
the object and the defocus blur kernel of each pixel. The entire framework
adopts a differentiable rendering method to self-supervise the optimization of
the 3D model and the defocus blur kernel. Extensive experiments show that from
a small number of multi-view images, our proposed method can not only achieve
high-quality image deblurring but also recover high-fidelity 3D appearance.

Motivation: 现有的基于扩散模型的去模糊方法存在推理时间过长和保真度不足的问题，限制了其在真实世界应用中的潜力。

Method: 将运动去模糊重新定义为扩散过程，每个时间步代表逐渐模糊的图像；训练一致性模型将所有时间步对齐到同一清晰图像；集成Kernel ControlNet进行模糊核估计；引入自适应时间步预测。

Conclusion: FideDiff为预训练扩散模型在高保真图像恢复任务中的应用提供了新方向，为在真实世界工业应用中推进扩散模型建立了坚实基础。

Abstract: Recent advancements in image motion deblurring, driven by CNNs and
transformers, have made significant progress. Large-scale pre-trained diffusion
models, which are rich in true-world modeling, have shown great promise for
high-quality image restoration tasks such as deblurring, demonstrating stronger
generative capabilities than CNN and transformer-based methods. However,
challenges such as unbearable inference time and compromised fidelity still
limit the full potential of the diffusion models. To address this, we introduce
FideDiff, a novel single-step diffusion model designed for high-fidelity
deblurring. We reformulate motion deblurring as a diffusion-like process where
each timestep represents a progressively blurred image, and we train a
consistency model that aligns all timesteps to the same clean image. By
reconstructing training data with matched blur trajectories, the model learns
temporal consistency, enabling accurate one-step deblurring. We further enhance
model performance by integrating Kernel ControlNet for blur kernel estimation
and introducing adaptive timestep prediction. Our model achieves superior
performance on full-reference metrics, surpassing previous diffusion-based
methods and matching the performance of other state-of-the-art models. FideDiff
offers a new direction for applying pre-trained diffusion models to
high-fidelity image restoration tasks, establishing a robust baseline for
further advancing diffusion models in real-world industrial applications. Our
dataset and code will be available at https://github.com/xyLiu339/FideDiff.

Motivation: 青铜器铭文是早期中国文字的重要阶段，但由于严重的视觉退化、跨照片/拓片/摹本的多域变异性以及极端长尾字符分布，自动识别仍然困难。

Method: 构建大型BI数据集（22454页图像，198598个标注字符，6658个类别），开发两阶段检测-识别流程，使用LadderMoE增强CLIP编码器实现动态专家专业化和更强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 为青铜器铭文识别和下游考古分析建立了坚实基础，提出的方法能有效处理多域变异性、视觉退化和长尾分布等挑战。

Abstract: Bronze inscriptions (BI), engraved on ritual vessels, constitute a crucial
stage of early Chinese writing and provide indispensable evidence for
archaeological and historical studies. However, automatic BI recognition
remains difficult due to severe visual degradation, multi-domain variability
across photographs, rubbings, and tracings, and an extremely long-tailed
character distribution. To address these challenges, we curate a large-scale BI
dataset comprising 22454 full-page images and 198598 annotated characters
spanning 6658 unique categories, enabling robust cross-domain evaluation.
Building on this resource, we develop a two-stage detection-recognition
pipeline that first localizes inscriptions and then transcribes individual
characters. To handle heterogeneous domains and rare classes, we equip the
pipeline with LadderMoE, which augments a pretrained CLIP encoder with
ladder-style MoE adapters, enabling dynamic expert specialization and stronger
robustness. Comprehensive experiments on single-character and full-page
recognition tasks demonstrate that our method substantially outperforms
state-of-the-art scene text recognition baselines, achieving superior accuracy
across head, mid, and tail categories as well as all acquisition modalities.
These results establish a strong foundation for bronze inscription recognition
and downstream archaeological analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的无监督领域自适应方法需要为每个新的源-目标对微调整个骨干网络，导致参数数量和存储需求线性增长，且无法重用训练好的骨干参数。

Method: 在骨干网络前添加领域特定的视觉重编程层，生成视觉提示作为纹理偏置来调整输入图像的风格，通过优化域内和域间分布差异来训练这些层，而不修改骨干网络参数。

Result: 在Office-31数据集上达到92.8%的平均准确率，仅需1.5M可训练参数，优于现有参数高效UDA基线方法，且参数使用量大幅减少。

Conclusion: VirDA通过视觉重编程实现了参数高效的领域自适应，能够在保持高性能的同时显著减少参数数量和存储需求，支持骨干网络在不同领域间的重用。

Abstract: Existing UDA pipelines fine-tune already well-trained backbone parameters for
every new source-and-target pair, resulting in the number of training
parameters and storage memory growing linearly with each new pair, and also
preventing the reuse of these well-trained backbone parameters.
  Inspired by recent implications that existing backbones have textural biases,
we propose making use of domain-specific textural bias for domain adaptation
via visual reprogramming, namely VirDA.Instead of fine-tuning the full
backbone, VirDA prepends a domain-specific visual reprogramming layer to the
backbone. This layer produces visual prompts that act as an added textural bias
to the input image, adapting its ``style'' to a target domain. To optimize
these visual reprogramming layers, we use multiple objective functions that
optimize the intra- and inter-domain distribution differences when
domain-adapting visual prompts are applied. This process does not require
modifying the backbone parameters, allowing the same backbone to be reused
across different domains.
  We evaluate VirDA on Office-31 and obtain 92.8% mean accuracy with only 1.5M
trainable parameters. VirDA surpasses PDA, the state-of-the-art
parameter-efficient UDA baseline, by +1.6% accuracy while using just 46% of its
parameters. Compared with full-backbone fine-tuning, VirDA outperforms CDTrans
and FixBi by +0.2% and +1.4%, respectively, while requiring only 1.7% and 2.8%
of their trainable parameters. Relative to the strongest current methods
(PMTrans and TVT), VirDA uses ~1.7% of their parameters and trades off only
2.2% and 1.1% accuracy, respectively.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为离散面部编码（DFE）的无监督数据驱动方法，通过残差向量量化变分自编码器从3D网格序列中学习紧凑可解释的面部表情字典，在心理任务中优于传统FACS系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有面部表情编码系统（如FACS）存在覆盖范围有限和手动标注成本高的问题，需要一种更有效、可扩展的替代方案。

Method: 使用3D可变形模型提取身份不变的表情特征，然后通过残差向量量化变分自编码器将这些特征编码为来自共享码本的离散标记序列，每个标记捕获特定的可重用面部变形模式。

Result: DFE比FACS和其他面部编码方法捕获更精确的面部行为，在压力检测、人格预测和抑郁检测等心理任务中，使用简单词袋模型就能持续优于基于FACS的流程和强图像/视频表示学习模型。

Conclusion: DFE作为FACS的可扩展有效替代方案，在心理学和情感计算应用中具有潜力，能够覆盖更广泛的面部表情显示。

Abstract: Facial expression analysis is central to understanding human behavior, yet
existing coding systems such as the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) are
constrained by limited coverage and costly manual annotation. In this work, we
introduce Discrete Facial Encoding (DFE), an unsupervised, data-driven
alternative of compact and interpretable dictionary of facial expressions from
3D mesh sequences learned through a Residual Vector Quantized Variational
Autoencoder (RVQ-VAE). Our approach first extracts identity-invariant
expression features from images using a 3D Morphable Model (3DMM), effectively
disentangling factors such as head pose and facial geometry. We then encode
these features using an RVQ-VAE, producing a sequence of discrete tokens from a
shared codebook, where each token captures a specific, reusable facial
deformation pattern that contributes to the overall expression. Through
extensive experiments, we demonstrate that Discrete Facial Encoding captures
more precise facial behaviors than FACS and other facial encoding alternatives.
We evaluate the utility of our representation across three high-level
psychological tasks: stress detection, personality prediction, and depression
detection. Using a simple Bag-of-Words model built on top of the learned
tokens, our system consistently outperforms both FACS-based pipelines and
strong image and video representation learning models such as Masked
Autoencoders. Further analysis reveals that our representation covers a wider
variety of facial displays, highlighting its potential as a scalable and
effective alternative to FACS for psychological and affective computing
applications.

Motivation: 现有的非刚性结构恢复方法依赖于严格的假设（如局部平面表面或局部线性变形），无法恢复保形尺度，限制了在单目视觉可变形SLAM中的应用。

Method: 使用基于图的框架优化2D选择的图像扭曲进行逐点重建，采用并行可分离迭代优化策略，并结合自监督学习框架生成带纹理的密集3D点云。

Conclusion: Con-NRSfM方法消除了现有方法的约束条件，能够准确计算局部保形尺度，为单目视觉可变形SLAM提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Non-rigid structure-from-motion (NRSfM), a promising technique for addressing
the mapping challenges in monocular visual deformable simultaneous localization
and mapping (SLAM), has attracted growing attention. We introduce a novel
method, called Con-NRSfM, for NRSfM under conformal deformations, encompassing
isometric deformations as a subset. Our approach performs point-wise
reconstruction using 2D selected image warps optimized through a graph-based
framework. Unlike existing methods that rely on strict assumptions, such as
locally planar surfaces or locally linear deformations, and fail to recover the
conformal scale, our method eliminates these constraints and accurately
computes the local conformal scale. Additionally, our framework decouples
constraints on depth and conformal scale, which are inseparable in other
approaches, enabling more precise depth estimation. To address the sensitivity
of the formulated problem, we employ a parallel separable iterative
optimization strategy. Furthermore, a self-supervised learning framework,
utilizing an encoder-decoder network, is incorporated to generate dense 3D
point clouds with texture. Simulation and experimental results using both
synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that our method surpasses existing
approaches in terms of reconstruction accuracy and robustness. The code for the
proposed method will be made publicly available on the project website:

*Jin Cao,Hongrui Wu,Ziyong Feng,Hujun Bao,Xiaowei Zhou,Sida Peng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniVerse是一个统一的鲁棒重建框架，通过视频扩散模型将不一致的多视角图像转换为一致图像，然后进行3D重建，解决了稀疏观测下的鲁棒重建问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖密集观测来优化模型参数，难以在稀疏观测下进行鲁棒重建。本文旨在解决从不一致多视角图像中重建3D场景的挑战。

Method: 将鲁棒重建解耦为恢复和重建两个子任务：首先将不一致图像转换为初始视频，然后使用专门设计的视频扩散模型恢复为一致图像，最后从恢复的图像重建3D场景。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法在鲁棒重建中具有强大的泛化能力和优越性能，并能控制重建3D场景的风格。

Conclusion: UniVerse通过利用扩散模型从大规模数据中学习通用场景先验，能够处理多样化的图像不一致性，为稀疏观测下的鲁棒3D重建提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: This paper tackles the challenge of robust reconstruction, i.e., the task of
reconstructing a 3D scene from a set of inconsistent multi-view images. Some
recent works have attempted to simultaneously remove image inconsistencies and
perform reconstruction by integrating image degradation modeling into neural 3D
scene representations.However, these methods rely heavily on dense observations
for robustly optimizing model parameters.To address this issue, we propose to
decouple robust reconstruction into two subtasks: restoration and
reconstruction, which naturally simplifies the optimization process.To this
end, we introduce UniVerse, a unified framework for robust reconstruction based
on a video diffusion model. Specifically, UniVerse first converts inconsistent
images into initial videos, then uses a specially designed video diffusion
model to restore them into consistent images, and finally reconstructs the 3D
scenes from these restored images.Compared with case-by-case per-view
degradation modeling, the diffusion model learns a general scene prior from
large-scale data, making it applicable to diverse image
inconsistencies.Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets
demonstrate the strong generalization capability and superior performance of
our method in robust reconstruction. Moreover, UniVerse can control the style
of the reconstructed 3D scene. Project page:

*Ke Jia,Ji Zhou,Hanxin Li,Zhigan Zhou,Haojie Chu,Xiaojie Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出轻量级端到端模板匹配框架，将模板匹配重新定义为联合定位和几何回归，输出中心坐标、旋转角度和独立缩放比例，解决了传统方法效率低和深度学习方法缺乏几何建模的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业检测和组件对准任务需要高效估计目标位置和几何状态，传统方法枚举角度和尺度效率低，而深度学习方法只估计相似度得分，缺乏几何姿态建模，无法满足实际部署需求。

Method: 使用模板感知动态卷积模块动态注入模板特征，集成深度可分离卷积和像素重排实现高效匹配；采用旋转-剪切增强策略和结构感知伪标签实现无几何标注训练；通过轻量级细化模块提升角度和尺度精度。

Result: 3.07M参数模型在复合变换下实现高精度和14ms推理时间，在小模板和多目标场景中表现出强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法适合实时工业应用部署，在复杂背景下实现了高效准确的模板匹配。

Abstract: In industrial inspection and component alignment tasks, template matching
requires efficient estimation of a target's position and geometric state
(rotation and scaling) under complex backgrounds to support precise downstream
operations. Traditional methods rely on exhaustive enumeration of angles and
scales, leading to low efficiency under compound transformations. Meanwhile,
most deep learning-based approaches only estimate similarity scores without
explicitly modeling geometric pose, making them inadequate for real-world
deployment. To overcome these limitations, we propose a lightweight end-to-end
framework that reformulates template matching as joint localization and
geometric regression, outputting the center coordinates, rotation angle, and
independent horizontal and vertical scales. A Template-Aware Dynamic
Convolution Module (TDCM) dynamically injects template features at inference to
guide generalizable matching. The compact network integrates depthwise
separable convolutions and pixel shuffle for efficient matching. To enable
geometric-annotation-free training, we introduce a rotation-shear-based
augmentation strategy with structure-aware pseudo labels. A lightweight
refinement module further improves angle and scale precision via local
optimization. Experiments show our 3.07M model achieves high precision and 14ms
inference under compound transformations. It also demonstrates strong
robustness in small-template and multi-object scenarios, making it highly
suitable for deployment in real-time industrial applications. The code is

*Xuchen Li,Xuzhao Li,Jiahui Gao,Renjie Pi,Shiyu Hu,Wentao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了首个自适应像素推理框架，通过动态确定必要的像素级操作来提升视觉语言模型在细粒度视觉任务中的性能，同时显著减少不必要的视觉操作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在处理需要精确理解细粒度视觉元素的任务时表现不佳，主要由于图像编码过程中的信息丢失或对关键区域关注不足。虽然引入像素级信息有所帮助，但往往会导致效率低下和无关视觉细节的干扰。

Method: 首先应用操作感知的监督微调建立文本推理和视觉操作的基础能力，然后设计新颖的rollout引导的强化学习框架，基于模型自身响应的反馈来动态决定何时调用像素操作。

Result: 在广泛的多模态推理基准测试中，模型实现了优越性能，同时显著减少了不必要的视觉操作。在HR-Bench 4K上达到73.4%准确率，工具使用率仅为20.1%，相比之前方法在提高准确率的同时减少了66.5%的工具使用。

Conclusion: 提出的自适应像素推理框架有效解决了视觉语言模型在细粒度视觉任务中的挑战，通过动态决策机制实现了性能提升与效率优化的平衡。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at many multimodal tasks, yet they
frequently struggle with tasks requiring precise understanding and handling of
fine-grained visual elements. This is mainly due to information loss during
image encoding or insufficient attention to critical regions. Recent work has
shown promise by incorporating pixel-level visual information into the
reasoning process, enabling VLMs to access high-resolution visual details
during their thought process. However, this pixel-level information is often
overused, leading to inefficiency and distraction from irrelevant visual
details. To address these challenges, we propose the first framework for
adaptive pixel reasoning that dynamically determines necessary pixel-level
operations based on the input query. Specifically, we first apply
operation-aware supervised fine-tuning to establish baseline competence in
textual reasoning and visual operations, then design a novel rollout-guided
reinforcement learning framework relying on feedback of the model's own
responses, which enables the VLM to determine when pixel operations should be
invoked based on query difficulty. Experiments on extensive multimodal
reasoning benchmarks show that our model achieves superior performance while
significantly reducing unnecessary visual operations. Impressively, our model
achieves 73.4\% accuracy on HR-Bench 4K while maintaining a tool usage ratio of
only 20.1\%, improving accuracy and simultaneously reducing tool usage by
66.5\% compared to the previous methods.

TL;DR: 提出了增强敏感性风险评分（ASRS）框架，通过测量临床合理旋转后的嵌入变化来识别易出错的胸部X光片病例，提高医学AI的公平性和安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型在胸部X光片解读中表现优异，但在患者亚组间存在准确性不均的问题，现有错误检测方法难以处理分布内的细微错误。

Method: ASRS框架应用临床合理的旋转（±15°/±30°），使用RAD-DINO编码器测量嵌入变化，通过敏感性评分将样本分层为稳定性四分位数。

Result: 高敏感性病例显示出显著较低的召回率（-0.2至-0.3），尽管具有高AUROC和置信度，证明了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: ASRS提供了一种无需标签的选择性预测和临床医生审查方法，有助于改善医学AI的公平性和安全性。

Abstract: Deep learning models achieve strong performance in chest radiograph (CXR)
interpretation, yet fairness and reliability concerns persist. Models often
show uneven accuracy across patient subgroups, leading to hidden failures not
reflected in aggregate metrics. Existing error detection approaches -- based on
confidence calibration or out-of-distribution (OOD) detection -- struggle with
subtle within-distribution errors, while image- and representation-level
consistency-based methods remain underexplored in medical imaging. We propose
an augmentation-sensitivity risk scoring (ASRS) framework to identify
error-prone CXR cases. ASRS applies clinically plausible rotations ($\pm
15^\circ$/$\pm 30^\circ$) and measures embedding shifts with the RAD-DINO
encoder. Sensitivity scores stratify samples into stability quartiles, where
highly sensitive cases show substantially lower recall ($-0.2$ to $-0.3$)
despite high AUROC and confidence. ASRS provides a label-free means for
selective prediction and clinician review, improving fairness and safety in
medical AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视频风格化方法存在时间一致性差、风格丰富度低的问题，而训练专门的视频风格化模型需要配对视频数据且计算成本高。

Method: 将多个风格化参考集成到预训练图转视频模型，使用高频补偿约束内容布局和运动，结合基于光流的运动线索保留低显著性区域的风格纹理。

Result: FreeViS在风格化保真度和时间一致性方面表现优异，超越现有基线方法并获得强烈的人类偏好。

Conclusion: 这种无需训练的流水线为高质量、时间一致的视频风格化提供了实用且经济的解决方案。

Abstract: Video stylization plays a key role in content creation, but it remains a
challenging problem. Na\"ively applying image stylization frame-by-frame hurts
temporal consistency and reduces style richness. Alternatively, training a
dedicated video stylization model typically requires paired video data and is
computationally expensive. In this paper, we propose FreeViS, a training-free
video stylization framework that generates stylized videos with rich style
details and strong temporal coherence. Our method integrates multiple stylized
references to a pretrained image-to-video (I2V) model, effectively mitigating
the propagation errors observed in prior works, without introducing flickers
and stutters. In addition, it leverages high-frequency compensation to
constrain the content layout and motion, together with flow-based motion cues
to preserve style textures in low-saliency regions. Through extensive
evaluations, FreeViS delivers higher stylization fidelity and superior temporal
consistency, outperforming recent baselines and achieving strong human
preference. Our training-free pipeline offers a practical and economic solution
for high-quality, temporally coherent video stylization. The code and videos

<details>

Motivation: 现有医学图像质量评估方法受限于标量评分指标，无法反映专家评估中的人类推理过程，需要建立更符合人类推理的评估范式。

Method: 构建MedQ-Bench基准，包含MedQ-Perception（低层感知能力）和MedQ-Reasoning（无参考和比较推理任务），采用多维度评判协议评估模型输出，并与放射科医生进行人机对齐验证。

Result: 评估14个最先进的MLLMs显示模型具有初步但不稳定的感知和推理能力，准确性不足以可靠临床使用。

Conclusion: MLLMs在医学图像质量评估中需要针对性优化，MedQ-Bench有望推动该领域的进一步探索和发展。

Abstract: Medical Image Quality Assessment (IQA) serves as the first-mile safety gate
for clinical AI, yet existing approaches remain constrained by scalar,
score-based metrics and fail to reflect the descriptive, human-like reasoning
process central to expert evaluation. To address this gap, we introduce
MedQ-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark that establishes a perception-reasoning
paradigm for language-based evaluation of medical image quality with
Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs). MedQ-Bench defines two complementary
tasks: (1) MedQ-Perception, which probes low-level perceptual capability via
human-curated questions on fundamental visual attributes; and (2)
MedQ-Reasoning, encompassing both no-reference and comparison reasoning tasks,
aligning model evaluation with human-like reasoning on image quality. The
benchmark spans five imaging modalities and over forty quality attributes,
totaling 2,600 perceptual queries and 708 reasoning assessments, covering
diverse image sources including authentic clinical acquisitions, images with
simulated degradations via physics-based reconstructions, and AI-generated
images. To evaluate reasoning ability, we propose a multi-dimensional judging
protocol that assesses model outputs along four complementary axes. We further
conduct rigorous human-AI alignment validation by comparing LLM-based judgement
with radiologists. Our evaluation of 14 state-of-the-art MLLMs demonstrates
that models exhibit preliminary but unstable perceptual and reasoning skills,
with insufficient accuracy for reliable clinical use. These findings highlight
the need for targeted optimization of MLLMs in medical IQA. We hope that
MedQ-Bench will catalyze further exploration and unlock the untapped potential
of MLLMs for medical image quality evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉模型在理解实例级几何关系方面存在挑战，依赖昂贵的输入格式（类别标签、分割掩码）和二次方的前向传播推理成本。

Method: InstaFormer利用对象查询和潜在掩码描述符之间的交互，这些描述符语义上表示相同对象但携带互补信息，实现整体顺序预测。

Result: 通过全面基准测试和消融实验验证了方法的有效性，代码和模型已开源。

Conclusion: InstaFormer能够仅从RGB图像中高效预测场景中所有实例的完整遮挡和深度顺序，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Even in controlled settings, understanding instance-wise geometries is a
challenging task for a wide range of visual models. Although specialized
systems exist, modern arts rely on expensive input formats (category labels,
binary segmentation masks) and inference costs (a quadratic amount of forward
passes). We mitigate these limitations by proposing InstaFormer, a network
capable of holistic order prediction. That is, solely given an input RGB image,
InstaFormer returns the full occlusion and depth orderings for all the
instances in the scene in a single forward pass. At its core, InstaFormer
relies on interactions between object queries and latent mask descriptors that
semantically represent the same objects while carrying complementary
information. We comprehensively benchmark and ablate our approach to highlight
its effectiveness. Our code and models are open-source and available at this

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的CNN和Transformer模型在处理复杂风格和高分辨率输入时存在效率问题，需要更高效的神经风格迁移方法。

Method: 提出PyramidStyler框架，采用金字塔位置编码(PPE)来捕捉局部细节和全局上下文，同时结合强化学习动态优化风格化过程。

Result: 在4000轮训练后，内容损失降低62.6%至2.07，风格损失降低57.4%至0.86，推理时间1.39秒；使用RL后进一步改善至内容损失2.03，风格损失0.75，推理时间1.40秒。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了实时高质量的艺术渲染，在媒体和设计领域具有广泛应用前景。

Abstract: Neural Style Transfer (NST) has evolved from Gatys et al.'s (2015) CNN-based
algorithm, enabling AI-driven artistic image synthesis. However, existing CNN
and transformer-based models struggle to scale efficiently to complex styles
and high-resolution inputs. We introduce PyramidStyler, a transformer framework
with Pyramidal Positional Encoding (PPE): a hierarchical, multi-scale encoding
that captures both local details and global context while reducing
computational load. We further incorporate reinforcement learning to
dynamically optimize stylization, accelerating convergence. Trained on
Microsoft COCO and WikiArt, PyramidStyler reduces content loss by 62.6% (to
2.07) and style loss by 57.4% (to 0.86) after 4000 epochs--achieving 1.39 s
inference--and yields further improvements (content 2.03; style 0.75) with
minimal speed penalty (1.40 s) when using RL. These results demonstrate
real-time, high-quality artistic rendering, with broad applications in media
and design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分治方法在大规模无边界场景中存在严重负载不平衡问题，且粗到细流水线效率低下，需要重新设计3DGS流水线。

Method: 提出深度感知分区方法减少预处理时间，采用基于优化的策略平衡可见高斯分布，并引入可见性裁剪和选择性致密化技术降低训练成本。

Result: 在大规模城市和户外数据集上，LoBE-GS比现有最优方法快2倍，保持重建质量的同时能够扩展到传统3DGS无法处理的场景。

Conclusion: LoBE-GS通过重新设计3DGS流水线，有效解决了大规模场景重建中的负载平衡和效率问题，实现了显著性能提升。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has established itself as an efficient
representation for real-time, high-fidelity 3D scene reconstruction. However,
scaling 3DGS to large and unbounded scenes such as city blocks remains
difficult. Existing divide-and-conquer methods alleviate memory pressure by
partitioning the scene into blocks, but introduce new bottlenecks: (i)
partitions suffer from severe load imbalance since uniform or heuristic splits
do not reflect actual computational demands, and (ii) coarse-to-fine pipelines
fail to exploit the coarse stage efficiently, often reloading the entire model
and incurring high overhead. In this work, we introduce LoBE-GS, a novel
Load-Balanced and Efficient 3D Gaussian Splatting framework, that re-engineers
the large-scale 3DGS pipeline. LoBE-GS introduces a depth-aware partitioning
method that reduces preprocessing from hours to minutes, an optimization-based
strategy that balances visible Gaussians -- a strong proxy for computational
load -- across blocks, and two lightweight techniques, visibility cropping and
selective densification, to further reduce training cost. Evaluations on
large-scale urban and outdoor datasets show that LoBE-GS consistently achieves
up to $2\times$ faster end-to-end training time than state-of-the-art
baselines, while maintaining reconstruction quality and enabling scalability to
scenes infeasible with vanilla 3DGS.

TL;DR: 提出了MemoryPack和Direct Forcing两种方法来解决长视频生成中的长期依赖建模和自回归解码错误累积问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长视频生成面临两个主要挑战：需要捕捉长期依赖关系，同时防止自回归解码中固有的错误累积

Method: 1. MemoryPack：可学习的上下文检索机制，利用文本和图像信息作为全局指导，联合建模短期和长期依赖关系；2. Direct Forcing：高效的单步近似策略，改善训练-推理对齐以减少推理时的错误传播

Result: 实现了分钟级别的时间一致性，计算效率高且保持线性复杂度，显著提升了长视频生成的上下文一致性和可靠性

Conclusion: MemoryPack和Direct Forcing共同推进了自回归视频模型的实际可用性

Abstract: Long-form video generation presents a dual challenge: models must capture
long-range dependencies while preventing the error accumulation inherent in
autoregressive decoding. To address these challenges, we make two
contributions. First, for dynamic context modeling, we propose MemoryPack, a
learnable context-retrieval mechanism that leverages both textual and image
information as global guidance to jointly model short- and long-term
dependencies, achieving minute-level temporal consistency. This design scales
gracefully with video length, preserves computational efficiency, and maintains
linear complexity. Second, to mitigate error accumulation, we introduce Direct
Forcing, an efficient single-step approximating strategy that improves
training-inference alignment and thereby curtails error propagation during
inference. Together, MemoryPack and Direct Forcing substantially enhance the
context consistency and reliability of long-form video generation, advancing
the practical usability of autoregressive video models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在自主系统中，精确的物体检测和不确定性估计对自我感知和安全操作至关重要。需要关注全预测置信度分布而非仅主导类的校准。

Method: 提出了两种辅助正则化损失项：一种校准主导预测，另一种校准全预测向量。评估了CenterPoint、PillarNet和DSVT-Pillar的后处理和训练时方法。

Result: 结合全类预测校准损失项和等渗回归在CenterPoint和PillarNet上实现了最佳校准效果，但DSVT-Pillar无法使用相同方法同时校准主导和次要预测。

Conclusion: 全预测分布校准对于3D物体检测器很重要，不同检测器需要不同的校准策略，DSVT-Pillar的校准需要特殊处理。

Abstract: In autonomous systems, precise object detection and uncertainty estimation
are critical for self-aware and safe operation. This work addresses confidence
calibration for the classification task of 3D object detectors. We argue that
it is necessary to regard the calibration of the full predictive confidence
distribution over all classes and deduce a metric which captures the
calibration of dominant and secondary class predictions. We propose two
auxiliary regularizing loss terms which introduce either calibration of the
dominant prediction or the full prediction vector as a training goal. We
evaluate a range of post-hoc and train-time methods for CenterPoint, PillarNet
and DSVT-Pillar and find that combining our loss term, which regularizes for
calibration of the full class prediction, and isotonic regression lead to the
best calibration of CenterPoint and PillarNet with respect to both dominant and
secondary class predictions. We further find that DSVT-Pillar can not be
jointly calibrated for dominant and secondary predictions using the same
method.

Motivation: 现有行人搜索方法主要使用ImageNet预训练骨干网络，可能无法有效捕捉复杂空间上下文和细粒度身份线索。同时，它们使用共享骨干网络特征来处理检测和重识别两个任务，导致优化目标冲突。

Method: 提出DiffPS框架，利用预训练扩散模型并消除两个子任务间的优化冲突。包含三个专门模块：扩散引导区域提议网络(DGRPN)用于增强行人定位、多尺度频率细化网络(MSFRN)减轻形状偏差、语义自适应特征聚合网络(SFAN)利用文本对齐的扩散特征。

Conclusion: DiffPS通过利用扩散先验知识有效解决了行人搜索中检测和重识别任务间的优化冲突问题，证明了扩散模型在行人搜索任务中的有效性。

Abstract: Person search aims to jointly perform person detection and re-identification
by localizing and identifying a query person within a gallery of uncropped
scene images. Existing methods predominantly utilize ImageNet pre-trained
backbones, which may be suboptimal for capturing the complex spatial context
and fine-grained identity cues necessary for person search. Moreover, they rely
on a shared backbone feature for both person detection and re-identification,
leading to suboptimal features due to conflicting optimization objectives. In
this paper, we propose DiffPS (Diffusion Prior Knowledge for Person Search), a
novel framework that leverages a pre-trained diffusion model while eliminating
the optimization conflict between two sub-tasks. We analyze key properties of
diffusion priors and propose three specialized modules: (i) Diffusion-Guided
Region Proposal Network (DGRPN) for enhanced person localization, (ii)
Multi-Scale Frequency Refinement Network (MSFRN) to mitigate shape bias, and
(iii) Semantic-Adaptive Feature Aggregation Network (SFAN) to leverage
text-aligned diffusion features. DiffPS sets a new state-of-the-art on
CUHK-SYSU and PRW.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高光谱成像成本高且重建困难，压缩感知系统如CASSI存在严重退化问题，需要更准确的重建方法。

Method: 将流匹配嵌入深度展开框架，引入平均速度损失增强流一致性，结合基于优化的可解释性和流匹配的生成能力。

Result: 在模拟和真实数据集上的广泛实验表明，FMU在重建质量上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FMU成功将流匹配集成到HSI重建中，通过混合设计实现了更鲁棒和准确的重建性能。

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) provides rich spatial-spectral information but
remains costly to acquire due to hardware limitations and the difficulty of
reconstructing three-dimensional data from compressed measurements. Although
compressive sensing systems such as CASSI improve efficiency, accurate
reconstruction is still challenged by severe degradation and loss of fine
spectral details. We propose the Flow-Matching-guided Unfolding network (FMU),
which, to our knowledge, is the first to integrate flow matching into HSI
reconstruction by embedding its generative prior within a deep unfolding
framework. To further strengthen the learned dynamics, we introduce a mean
velocity loss that enforces global consistency of the flow, leading to a more
robust and accurate reconstruction. This hybrid design leverages the
interpretability of optimization-based methods and the generative capacity of

*Wei-Lung Mao,Chun-Chi Wang,Po-Heng Chou,Yen-Ting Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于深度学习的双列直插封装(DIP)自动缺陷检测系统，使用ConSinGAN生成训练数据，YOLOv7模型在准确率和检测时间上表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统工业组件缺陷检测耗时耗力，给质检人员带来负担且难以管理产品质量，需要自动化解决方案。

Method: 使用数字相机光学系统和深度学习模型，采用ConSinGAN生成缺陷图像数据集，比较四种YOLO模型(v3,v4,v7,v9)性能。

Result: YOLOv7+ConSinGAN组合达到95.50%准确率和285ms检测时间，远优于阈值方法和其他YOLO版本。

Conclusion: 该自动缺陷检测系统可轻松应用于多种缺陷类型或缺陷数据不足的情况，并开发了SCADA系统进行监控。

Abstract: Since the defect detection of conventional industry components is
time-consuming and labor-intensive, it leads to a significant burden on quality
inspection personnel and makes it difficult to manage product quality. In this
paper, we propose an automated defect detection system for the dual in-line
package (DIP) that is widely used in industry, using digital camera optics and
a deep learning (DL)-based model. The two most common defect categories of DIP
are examined: (1) surface defects, and (2) pin-leg defects. However, the lack
of defective component images leads to a challenge for detection tasks. To
solve this problem, the ConSinGAN is used to generate a suitable-sized dataset
for training and testing. Four varieties of the YOLO model are investigated
(v3, v4, v7, and v9), both in isolation and with the ConSinGAN augmentation.
The proposed YOLOv7 with ConSinGAN is superior to the other YOLO versions in
accuracy of 95.50\%, detection time of 285 ms, and is far superior to
threshold-based approaches. In addition, the supervisory control and data
acquisition (SCADA) system is developed, and the associated sensor architecture
is described. The proposed automated defect detection can be easily established
with numerous types of defects or insufficient defect data.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出FoundAD方法，利用基础视觉编码器学习正常图像分布，通过非线性投影算子检测异常区域，在少样本异常检测中实现竞争性性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业安全检查中少样本异常检测面临样本有限、类别不可知条件下难以准确区分正常与异常特征的挑战。

Method: 利用大规模预训练基础视觉编码器学习正常图像分布，设计非线性投影算子到自然图像流形，通过嵌入差异检测异常区域。

Result: 实验表明该方法支持多类检测，性能具有竞争力，且参数量显著少于现有方法，在多个基础编码器上验证有效。

Conclusion: 该方法拓宽了基础特征的应用视角，推动了少样本异常检测领域的发展。

Abstract: Few-shot anomaly detection streamlines and simplifies industrial safety
inspection. However, limited samples make accurate differentiation between
normal and abnormal features challenging, and even more so under
category-agnostic conditions. Large-scale pre-training of foundation visual
encoders has advanced many fields, as the enormous quantity of data helps to
learn the general distribution of normal images. We observe that the anomaly
amount in an image directly correlates with the difference in the learnt
embeddings and utilize this to design a few-shot anomaly detector termed
FoundAD. This is done by learning a nonlinear projection operator onto the
natural image manifold. The simple operator acts as an effective tool for
anomaly detection to characterize and identify out-of-distribution regions in
an image. Extensive experiments show that our approach supports multi-class
detection and achieves competitive performance while using substantially fewer
parameters than prior methods. Backed up by evaluations with multiple
foundation encoders, including fresh DINOv3, we believe this idea broadens the
perspective on foundation features and advances the field of few-shot anomaly
detection.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ClustViT通过可训练的聚类模块和再生器模块优化Vision Transformer，在保持分割精度的同时显著降低计算复杂度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformer在真实机器人系统中应用受限，因为其二次注意力复杂度太高。现有的token合并方法适合分类任务但不适合密集预测任务

Method: 在ViT骨干网络中加入可训练的聚类模块，根据分割掩码的伪聚类指导合并相似token，然后通过再生器模块恢复细节信息

Result: 在三个数据集上实现高达2.18倍GFLOPs减少和1.64倍推理加速，同时保持可比较的分割精度

Conclusion: ClustViT为密集预测任务提供了一种高效的Vision Transformer架构，平衡了计算效率和分割性能

Abstract: Vision Transformers can achieve high accuracy and strong generalization
across various contexts, but their practical applicability on real-world
robotic systems is limited due to their quadratic attention complexity. Recent
works have focused on dynamically merging tokens according to the image
complexity. Token merging works well for classification but is less suited to
dense prediction. We propose ClustViT, where we expand upon the Vision
Transformer (ViT) backbone and address semantic segmentation. Within our
architecture, a trainable Cluster module merges similar tokens along the
network guided by pseudo-clusters from segmentation masks. Subsequently, a
Regenerator module restores fine details for downstream heads. Our approach
achieves up to 2.18x fewer GFLOPs and 1.64x faster inference on three different
datasets, with comparable segmentation accuracy. Our code and models will be
made publicly available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Patch-as-Decodable Token (PaDT)方法，使多模态大语言模型能够直接生成文本和多样化视觉输出，解决了现有方法依赖间接表示的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态大语言模型在视觉任务中通常依赖间接表示（如将坐标生成为文本），这限制了性能并阻碍了密集预测任务（如分割）的实现。

Method: 引入视觉参考标记(VRTs)，从查询图像的视觉补丁嵌入中提取，并与LLM的输出文本标记无缝交织。使用轻量级解码器将LLM输出转换为检测、分割和定位预测。

Result: 在四个视觉感知和理解任务上的实证研究表明，PaDT始终达到最先进的性能，甚至与显著更大的MLLM模型相比也是如此。

Conclusion: PaDT提供了一种统一的范式，使MLLM能够直接生成文本和多样化视觉输出，显著提升了视觉任务的性能。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have advanced rapidly in recent
years. However, existing approaches for vision tasks often rely on indirect
representations, such as generating coordinates as text for detection, which
limits performance and prevents dense prediction tasks like segmentation. To
overcome these challenges, we introduce Patch-as-Decodable Token (PaDT), a
unified paradigm that enables MLLMs to directly generate both textual and
diverse visual outputs. Central to PaDT are Visual Reference Tokens (VRTs),
derived from visual patch embeddings of query images and interleaved seamlessly
with LLM's output textual tokens. A lightweight decoder then transforms LLM's
outputs into detection, segmentation, and grounding predictions. Unlike prior
methods, PaDT processes VRTs independently at each forward pass and dynamically
expands the embedding table, thus improving localization and differentiation
among similar objects. We further tailor a training strategy for PaDT by
randomly selecting VRTs for supervised fine-tuning and introducing a robust
per-token cross-entropy loss. Our empirical studies across four visual
perception and understanding tasks suggest PaDT consistently achieving
state-of-the-art performance, even compared with significantly larger MLLM
models. The code is available at https://github.com/Gorilla-Lab-SCUT/PaDT.

TL;DR: 该论文针对生鲜电商的信任赤字问题，提出了'信任金字塔'模型和'三角信任指数'，设计了可解释AI框架TriAlignXA，通过多目标优化在农产品约束下支持可信在线交易。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决生鲜电商中因无法直接感知产品质量而导致的信任赤字问题，传统绝对分级标准存在生物特性、时效性和经济可行性之间的'不可能三角'限制。

Method: 构建'信任金字塔'模型，提出'三角信任指数'量化权衡，设计TriAlignXA可解释AI框架，包含生物自适应引擎、时效优化引擎和经济优化引擎，采用'预映射机制'将流程数据编码为二维码。

Result: 在分级任务实验中准确率显著高于基线模型，实证和理论分析验证了框架在解决'不可能三角'方面的平衡能力。

Conclusion: 该研究为构建可信在线农产品生态系统提供了从理论到实践的全面支持，建立了从算法决策到消费者信任的关键路径。

Abstract: The 'trust deficit' in online fruit and vegetable e-commerce stems from the
inability of digital transactions to provide direct sensory perception of
product quality. This paper constructs a 'Trust Pyramid' model through
'dual-source verification' of consumer trust. Experiments confirm that quality
is the cornerstone of trust. The study reveals an 'impossible triangle' in
agricultural product grading, comprising biological characteristics,
timeliness, and economic viability, highlighting the limitations of traditional
absolute grading standards. To quantitatively assess this trade-off, we propose
the 'Triangular Trust Index' (TTI). We redefine the role of algorithms from
'decision-makers' to 'providers of transparent decision-making bases',
designing the explainable AI framework--TriAlignXA. This framework supports
trustworthy online transactions within agricultural constraints through
multi-objective optimization. Its core relies on three engines: the
Bio-Adaptive Engine for granular quality description; the Timeliness
Optimization Engine for processing efficiency; and the Economic Optimization
Engine for cost control. Additionally, the "Pre-Mapping Mechanism" encodes
process data into QR codes, transparently conveying quality information.
Experiments on grading tasks demonstrate significantly higher accuracy than
baseline models. Empirical evidence and theoretical analysis verify the
framework's balancing capability in addressing the "impossible triangle". This
research provides comprehensive support--from theory to practice--for building
a trustworthy online produce ecosystem, establishing a critical pathway from
algorithmic decision-making to consumer trust.

TL;DR: 4DGS-Craft是一个一致且交互式的4D高斯溅射编辑框架，通过4D感知的InstructPix2Pix模型、多视图网格模块和Gaussian选择机制，解决了视图、时间一致性和复杂文本指令处理的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的4D高斯溅射编辑方法在视图、时间一致性、非编辑区域保持以及复杂文本指令处理方面面临挑战，需要更一致和可控的编辑框架。

Method: 提出4D感知InstructPix2Pix模型结合4D VGGT几何特征；使用多视图网格模块迭代优化多视图输入；设计Gaussian选择机制仅优化编辑区域；采用基于LLM的用户意图理解模块分解复杂指令。

Result: 相比相关工作，该方法实现了更一致和可控的4D场景编辑，能够处理复杂的用户指令并保持非编辑区域的稳定性。

Conclusion: 4DGS-Craft框架有效解决了4D高斯溅射编辑中的一致性和交互性问题，为复杂4D场景编辑提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) editing still face challenges
with view, temporal, and non-editing region consistency, as well as with
handling complex text instructions. To address these issues, we propose
4DGS-Craft, a consistent and interactive 4DGS editing framework. We first
introduce a 4D-aware InstructPix2Pix model to ensure both view and temporal
consistency. This model incorporates 4D VGGT geometry features extracted from
the initial scene, enabling it to capture underlying 4D geometric structures
during editing. We further enhance this model with a multi-view grid module
that enforces consistency by iteratively refining multi-view input images while
jointly optimizing the underlying 4D scene. Furthermore, we preserve the
consistency of non-edited regions through a novel Gaussian selection mechanism,
which identifies and optimizes only the Gaussians within the edited regions.
Beyond consistency, facilitating user interaction is also crucial for effective
4DGS editing. Therefore, we design an LLM-based module for user intent
understanding. This module employs a user instruction template to define atomic
editing operations and leverages an LLM for reasoning. As a result, our
framework can interpret user intent and decompose complex instructions into a
logical sequence of atomic operations, enabling it to handle intricate user
commands and further enhance editing performance. Compared to related works,
our approach enables more consistent and controllable 4D scene editing. Our
code will be made available upon acceptance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Pure-Pass (PP)像素级掩码机制，通过固定颜色中心点分类像素，免除纯像素的昂贵计算，集成到ATD-light模型中实现高效超分辨率重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有轻量级超分辨率方法如CAMixer存在适应性差、掩码粒度粗和空间灵活性不足等问题，需要更精细的计算优化机制。

Method: 使用Pure-Pass像素级掩码机制，基于固定颜色中心点对像素分类，识别纯像素并免除其昂贵计算，集成到ATD-light模型中。

Result: PP-ATD-light在保存相似计算量的情况下，在重建质量和参数效率方面均优于CAMixer-ATD-light。

Conclusion: Pure-Pass机制实现了细粒度、空间灵活的掩码，以最小开销获得优越的超分辨率性能，证明了像素级计算优化的有效性。

Abstract: Image Super-Resolution (SR) aims to reconstruct high-resolution images from
low-resolution counterparts, but the computational complexity of deep
learning-based methods often hinders practical deployment. CAMixer is the
pioneering work to integrate the advantages of existing lightweight SR methods
and proposes a content-aware mixer to route token mixers of varied complexities
according to the difficulty of content recovery. However, several limitations
remain, such as poor adaptability, coarse-grained masking and spatial
inflexibility, among others. We propose Pure-Pass (PP), a pixel-level masking
mechanism that identifies pure pixels and exempts them from expensive
computations. PP utilizes fixed color center points to classify pixels into
distinct categories, enabling fine-grained, spatially flexible masking while
maintaining adaptive flexibility. Integrated into the state-of-the-art
ATD-light model, PP-ATD-light achieves superior SR performance with minimal
overhead, outperforming CAMixer-ATD-light in reconstruction quality and
parameter efficiency when saving a similar amount of computation.

TL;DR: 本研究开发了SLSO框架，利用GPT-4o自动生成颌骨囊肿的影像学发现，通过自校正循环提高准确性，在牙号识别、牙齿移动和牙根吸收等项目上取得显著改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用多模态AI自动生成颌骨囊肿的影像学发现，但传统方法存在准确性不足的问题，需要开发更可靠的框架来提高输出质量。

Method: 构建自校正循环结构化输出(SLSO)框架，包含10步流程：图像输入分析、结构化数据生成、牙号提取与一致性检查、不一致时迭代再生、发现生成与重构验证。与传统的思维链方法进行对比实验。

Result: SLSO框架在多个评估项目上提升准确性：牙号识别改进66.9%，牙齿移动改进33.3%，牙根吸收改进28.6%。成功案例经过最多5次再生后获得一致结构化输出。

Conclusion: SLSO框架能强制阴性发现描述、抑制幻觉、提高牙号识别准确性，但广泛病变的准确识别仍有限制，需要进一步优化以实现实用的发现生成系统。

Abstract: In this study, we utilized the multimodal capabilities of OpenAI GPT-4o to
automatically generate jaw cyst findings on dental panoramic radiographs. To
improve accuracy, we constructed a Self-correction Loop with Structured Output
(SLSO) framework and verified its effectiveness. A 10-step process was
implemented for 22 cases of jaw cysts, including image input and analysis,
structured data generation, tooth number extraction and consistency checking,
iterative regeneration when inconsistencies were detected, and finding
generation with subsequent restructuring and consistency verification. A
comparative experiment was conducted using the conventional Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) method across seven evaluation items: transparency, internal structure,
borders, root resorption, tooth movement, relationships with other structures,
and tooth number. The results showed that the proposed SLSO framework improved
output accuracy for many items, with 66.9%, 33.3%, and 28.6% improvement rates
for tooth number, tooth movement, and root resorption, respectively. In the
successful cases, a consistently structured output was achieved after up to
five regenerations. Although statistical significance was not reached because
of the small size of the dataset, the overall SLSO framework enforced negative
finding descriptions, suppressed hallucinations, and improved tooth number
identification accuracy. However, the accurate identification of extensive
lesions spanning multiple teeth is limited. Nevertheless, further refinement is
required to enhance overall performance and move toward a practical finding
generation system.

Motivation: 开发一种仅依赖LiDAR点云的3D自编码器，在真实交通环境中实现高效特征提取，同时避免使用过多计算资源。

Method: 采用跳跃连接概念，减少编码器层数并简化跳跃连接结构，在保持高效潜在空间表示的同时准确重建原始点云。

Result: 模型在跳跃连接携带信息与潜在编码之间实现了有效平衡，提高了重建质量且不牺牲性能，展现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: LiLa-Net架构成功实现了资源高效的3D点云重建，在真实交通环境中表现优异，并能泛化到非交通相关物体的重建。

Abstract: This work proposed a 3D autoencoder architecture, named LiLa-Net, which
encodes efficient features from real traffic environments, employing only the
LiDAR's point clouds. For this purpose, we have real semi-autonomous vehicle,
equipped with Velodyne LiDAR. The system leverage skip connections concept to
improve the performance without using extensive resources as the
state-of-the-art architectures. Key changes include reducing the number of
encoder layers and simplifying the skip connections, while still producing an
efficient and representative latent space which allows to accurately
reconstruct the original point cloud. Furthermore, an effective balance has
been achieved between the information carried by the skip connections and the
latent encoding, leading to improved reconstruction quality without
compromising performance. Finally, the model demonstrates strong generalization
capabilities, successfully reconstructing objects unrelated to the original
traffic environment.

Method: 整合无人机视频与机器学习系统，利用目标检测、跟踪和行为分类技术提取行为、社交和空间指标。

Result: 相比地面方法，无人机观测显著改善行为粒度，可见性损失减少15%，捕获更多行为转换且准确性和连续性更高。验证了969个行为序列，发现不同斑马物种的行为差异和空间隔离模式。

Conclusion: kabr-tools通过规模化自动行为监测，为生态系统研究、保护和生态监测提供了强大工具。

Abstract: A comprehensive understanding of animal behavior ecology depends on scalable
approaches to quantify and interpret complex, multidimensional behavioral
patterns. Traditional field observations are often limited in scope,
time-consuming, and labor-intensive, hindering the assessment of behavioral
responses across landscapes. To address this, we present kabr-tools (Kenyan
Animal Behavior Recognition Tools), an open-source package for automated
multi-species behavioral monitoring. This framework integrates drone-based
video with machine learning systems to extract behavioral, social, and spatial
metrics from wildlife footage. Our pipeline leverages object detection,
tracking, and behavioral classification systems to generate key metrics,
including time budgets, behavioral transitions, social interactions, habitat
associations, and group composition dynamics. Compared to ground-based methods,
drone-based observations significantly improved behavioral granularity,
reducing visibility loss by 15% and capturing more transitions with higher
accuracy and continuity. We validate kabr-tools through three case studies,
analyzing 969 behavioral sequences, surpassing the capacity of traditional
methods for data capture and annotation. We found that, like Plains zebras,
vigilance in Grevy's zebras decreases with herd size, but, unlike Plains
zebras, habitat has a negligible impact. Plains and Grevy's zebras exhibit
strong behavioral inertia, with rare transitions to alert behaviors and
observed spatial segregation between Grevy's zebras, Plains zebras, and
giraffes in mixed-species herds. By enabling automated behavioral monitoring at
scale, kabr-tools offers a powerful tool for ecosystem-wide studies, advancing
conservation, biodiversity research, and ecological monitoring.

Result: 在TexMorph基准测试中，GaussianMorphing显著优于先前的2D/3D方法，颜色一致性误差(ΔE)降低22.2%，EI降低26.2%。

Conclusion: 该框架成功实现了无需标签数据的语义感知3D形变，在保持纹理保真度和几何一致性的同时，显著提升了形变质量。

Abstract: We introduce GaussianMorphing, a novel framework for semantic-aware 3D shape
and texture morphing from multi-view images. Previous approaches usually rely
on point clouds or require pre-defined homeomorphic mappings for untextured
data. Our method overcomes these limitations by leveraging mesh-guided 3D
Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for high-fidelity geometry and appearance modeling.
The core of our framework is a unified deformation strategy that anchors
3DGaussians to reconstructed mesh patches, ensuring geometrically consistent
transformations while preserving texture fidelity through topology-aware
constraints. In parallel, our framework establishes unsupervised semantic
correspondence by using the mesh topology as a geometric prior and maintains
structural integrity via physically plausible point trajectories. This
integrated approach preserves both local detail and global semantic coherence
throughout the morphing process with out requiring labeled data. On our
proposed TexMorph benchmark, GaussianMorphing substantially outperforms prior
2D/3D methods, reducing color consistency error ($\Delta E$) by 22.2% and EI by
26.2%. Project page: https://baiyunshu.github.io/GAUSSIANMORPHING.github.io/

Motivation: 现有基于条件扩散模型的方法泛化能力差，主要因为位置测量高度受用户体型影响，需要解决跨用户泛化问题。

Method: 将姿态估计建模为逆问题，使用预训练扩散模型并仅以旋转测量为条件，通过从测量位置导出的似然项指导模型先验。

Result: InPose方法能够零样本泛化到不同用户，生成与稀疏身体测量最匹配的高度可能姿态序列。

Conclusion: 提出的逆问题公式和算法设计有效解决了跨用户泛化问题，为有限传感器下的姿态估计提供了新思路。

Abstract: Pose estimation refers to tracking a human's full body posture, including
their head, torso, arms, and legs. The problem is challenging in practical
settings where the number of body sensors are limited. Past work has shown
promising results using conditional diffusion models, where the pose prediction
is conditioned on both <location, rotation> measurements from the sensors.
Unfortunately, nearly all these approaches generalize poorly across users,
primarly because location measurements are highly influenced by the body size
of the user. In this paper, we formulate pose estimation as an inverse problem
and design an algorithm capable of zero-shot generalization. Our idea utilizes
a pre-trained diffusion model and conditions it on rotational measurements
alone; the priors from this model are then guided by a likelihood term, derived
from the measured locations. Thus, given any user, our proposed InPose method
generatively estimates the highly likely sequence of poses that best explains
the sparse on-body measurements.

Motivation: 传统卷积架构如U-Net在捕捉长距离依赖方面受限，影响复杂肿瘤结构的分割性能。扩散模型在医学图像生成和边界细化方面显示出潜力。

Method: 在扩散过程核心嵌入视觉变换器，利用全局上下文推理和迭代去噪，结合变换器骨干网络建模空间关系和扩散细化减少体素级误差。

Result: 在MRI脑肿瘤数据集上的实验验证显示，在Dice相似性和Hausdorff距离指标上获得一致提升。

Conclusion: 变换器引导的扩散模型为肿瘤分割提供了改进的鲁棒性和可扩展性路径，超越传统U-Net基线。

Abstract: Accurate detection and segmentation of brain tumors from magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) are essential for diagnosis, treatment planning, and clinical
monitoring. While convolutional architectures such as U-Net have long been the
backbone of medical image segmentation, their limited capacity to capture
long-range dependencies constrains performance on complex tumor structures.
Recent advances in diffusion models have demonstrated strong potential for
generating high-fidelity medical images and refining segmentation boundaries.
  In this work, we propose VGDM: Vision-Guided Diffusion Model for Brain Tumor
Detection and Segmentation framework, a transformer-driven diffusion framework
for brain tumor detection and segmentation. By embedding a vision transformer
at the core of the diffusion process, the model leverages global contextual
reasoning together with iterative denoising to enhance both volumetric accuracy
and boundary precision. The transformer backbone enables more effective
modeling of spatial relationships across entire MRI volumes, while diffusion
refinement mitigates voxel-level errors and recovers fine-grained tumor
details.
  This hybrid design provides a pathway toward improved robustness and
scalability in neuro-oncology, moving beyond conventional U-Net baselines.
Experimental validation on MRI brain tumor datasets demonstrates consistent
gains in Dice similarity and Hausdorff distance, underscoring the potential of
transformer-guided diffusion models to advance the state of the art in tumor
segmentation.

Abstract: Quantitative analysis of historical urban sprawl in France before the 1970s
is hindered by the lack of nationwide digital urban footprint data. This study
bridges this gap by developing a scalable deep learning pipeline to extract
urban areas from the Scan Histo historical map series (1925-1950), which
produces the first open-access, national-scale urban footprint dataset for this
pivotal period. Our key innovation is a dual-pass U-Net approach designed to
handle the high radiometric and stylistic complexity of historical maps. The
first pass, trained on an initial dataset, generates a preliminary map that
identifies areas of confusion, such as text and roads, to guide targeted data
augmentation. The second pass uses a refined dataset and the binarized output
of the first model to minimize radiometric noise, which significantly reduces
false positives. Deployed on a high-performance computing cluster, our method
processes 941 high-resolution tiles covering the entirety of metropolitan
France. The final mosaic achieves an overall accuracy of 73%, effectively
capturing diverse urban patterns while overcoming common artifacts like labels
and contour lines. We openly release the code, training datasets, and the
resulting nationwide urban raster to support future research in long-term
urbanization dynamics.

*Woowon Jang,Jiwon Im,Juseung Choi,Niki Rashidian,Wesley De Neve,Utku Ozbulak*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 分析了SAM2等视频对象分割模型在腹腔镜胆囊切除术视频中点跟踪的失败模式，发现点跟踪对于手术工具表现良好，但对于解剖目标表现较差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 点跟踪在复杂手术环境中的可靠性和失败情况尚未得到充分理解，需要系统分析其在腹腔镜胆囊切除术中的表现。

Method: 在腹腔镜胆囊切除术视频中，针对胆囊、抓钳和L型电钩三个手术目标，比较了点跟踪与分割掩码初始化的性能。

Result: 点跟踪对于手术工具具有竞争力，但对于解剖目标表现不佳，主要由于组织相似性和边界模糊导致失败。

Conclusion: 通过定性分析揭示了影响跟踪结果的关键因素，并提供了选择跟踪点和放置位置的可操作建议，以改善手术视频分析性能。

Abstract: Video object segmentation (VOS) models such as SAM2 offer promising zero-shot
tracking capabilities for surgical videos using minimal user input. Among the
available input types, point-based tracking offers an efficient and low-cost
alternative, yet its reliability and failure cases in complex surgical
environments are not well understood. In this work, we systematically analyze
the failure modes of point-based tracking in laparoscopic cholecystectomy
videos. Focusing on three surgical targets, the gallbladder, grasper, and
L-hook electrocautery, we compare the performance of point-based tracking with
segmentation mask initialization. Our results show that point-based tracking is
competitive for surgical tools but consistently underperforms for anatomical
targets, where tissue similarity and ambiguous boundaries lead to failure.
Through qualitative analysis, we reveal key factors influencing tracking
outcomes and provide several actionable recommendations for selecting and
placing tracking points to improve performance in surgical video analysis.

*Ding-Ruei Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了FFREEDG任务——在服务器上预训练模型后，仅使用客户端的未标记数据进行联邦学习，不再访问源数据。提出FRIEREN框架，利用视觉基础模型的多模态能力解决这一挑战性任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习在语义分割任务中面临域偏移挑战，特别是当客户端数据未标记时。现有方法要么不切实际地假设客户端有标记数据，要么未能充分利用现代视觉基础模型的能力。

Method: FRIEREN框架整合视觉和语言模态，使用基于CLIP文本嵌入的视觉语言解码器改进语义消歧，采用弱到强一致性学习策略在伪标签上进行鲁棒的本地训练。

Result: 在合成到真实和清晰到恶劣天气基准测试中，该框架有效解决了新任务，性能与现有域泛化和适应方法相当，为未来研究建立了强基线。

Conclusion: FRIEREN框架成功解决了FFREEDG这一具有挑战性的任务，展示了利用视觉基础模型多模态能力在联邦学习中的有效性。

Abstract: Federeated Learning (FL) offers a privacy-preserving solution for Semantic
Segmentation (SS) tasks to adapt to new domains, but faces significant
challenges from these domain shifts, particularly when client data is
unlabeled. However, most existing FL methods unrealistically assume access to
labeled data on remote clients or fail to leverage the power of modern Vision
Foundation Models (VFMs). Here, we propose a novel and challenging task,
FFREEDG, in which a model is pretrained on a server's labeled source dataset
and subsequently trained across clients using only their unlabeled data,
without ever re-accessing the source. To solve FFREEDG, we propose FRIEREN, a
framework that leverages the knowledge of a VFM by integrating vision and
language modalities. Our approach employs a Vision-Language decoder guided by
CLIP-based text embeddings to improve semantic disambiguation and uses a
weak-to-strong consistency learning strategy for robust local training on
pseudo-labels. Our experiments on synthetic-to-real and
clear-to-adverse-weather benchmarks demonstrate that our framework effectively
tackles this new task, achieving competitive performance against established
domain generalization and adaptation methods and setting a strong baseline for
future research.

*Shu Zou,Xinyu Tian,Lukas Wesemann,Fabian Waschkowski,Zhaoyuan Yang,Jing Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ASK-Hint是一个基于提示的框架，通过细粒度的动作知识引导冻结的视觉语言模型进行视频异常检测，在准确性和可解释性方面都表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的提示方法过于抽象，忽略了定义监控视频中复杂异常的人类-物体交互或动作语义，需要更细粒度的提示来引导模型推理。

Method: 提出结构化提示框架，将提示组织成语义连贯的组别（如暴力、财产犯罪、公共安全），并制定细粒度的指导性问题，使模型预测与判别性视觉线索对齐。

Result: 在UCF-Crime和XD-Violence数据集上的实验显示，ASK-Hint在AUC指标上持续优于现有基线，相比微调和无需训练的方法都达到了最先进性能。

Conclusion: 该框架强调了提示粒度的重要性，为可解释的视频异常检测提供了一个无需训练且可泛化的解决方案。

Abstract: Prompting has emerged as a practical way to adapt frozen vision-language
models (VLMs) for video anomaly detection (VAD). Yet, existing prompts are
often overly abstract, overlooking the fine-grained human-object interactions
or action semantics that define complex anomalies in surveillance videos. We
propose ASK-Hint, a structured prompting framework that leverages
action-centric knowledge to elicit more accurate and interpretable reasoning
from frozen VLMs. Our approach organizes prompts into semantically coherent
groups (e.g. violence, property crimes, public safety) and formulates
fine-grained guiding questions that align model predictions with discriminative
visual cues. Extensive experiments on UCF-Crime and XD-Violence show that
ASK-Hint consistently improves AUC over prior baselines, achieving
state-of-the-art performance compared to both fine-tuned and training-free
methods. Beyond accuracy, our framework provides interpretable reasoning traces
towards anomaly and demonstrates strong generalization across datasets and VLM
backbones. These results highlight the critical role of prompt granularity and
establish ASK-Hint as a new training-free and generalizable solution for
explainable video anomaly detection.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GeoPurify通过学生亲和网络利用3D自监督教师模型的几何先验来净化2D VLM生成的3D点特征，有效解决了2D到3D特征转移中的噪声和几何不一致问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的2D视觉语言模型特征向3D语义分割的转移方法存在权衡：直接投影会产生噪声预测，而强制几何一致性需要昂贵的训练流程和大规模标注3D数据。

Method: 提出GeoPurify方法，使用小型学生亲和网络从3D自监督教师模型中提取几何先验来净化2D VLM生成的3D点特征，并在推理时采用几何引导池化模块进一步去噪。

Result: 在主要3D基准测试中，GeoPurify达到或超越了最先进性能，同时仅使用约1.5%的训练数据，表现出卓越的数据效率。

Conclusion: GeoPurify通过利用潜在几何信息和学习的亲和网络，有效缓解了2D到3D特征转移的权衡问题，实现了优越的数据效率。

Abstract: Recent attempts to transfer features from 2D Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to
3D semantic segmentation expose a persistent trade-off. Directly projecting 2D
features into 3D yields noisy and fragmented predictions, whereas enforcing
geometric coherence necessitates costly training pipelines and large-scale
annotated 3D data. We argue that this limitation stems from the dominant
segmentation-and-matching paradigm, which fails to reconcile 2D semantics with
3D geometric structure. The geometric cues are not eliminated during the
2D-to-3D transfer but remain latent within the noisy and view-aggregated
features. To exploit this property, we propose GeoPurify that applies a small
Student Affinity Network to purify 2D VLM-generated 3D point features using
geometric priors distilled from a 3D self-supervised teacher model. During
inference, we devise a Geometry-Guided Pooling module to further denoise the
point cloud and ensure the semantic and structural consistency. Benefiting from
latent geometric information and the learned affinity network, GeoPurify
effectively mitigates the trade-off and achieves superior data efficiency.
Extensive experiments on major 3D benchmarks demonstrate that GeoPurify
achieves or surpasses state-of-the-art performance while utilizing only about
1.5% of the training data. Our codes and checkpoints are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于猪耳静脉模式的非侵入性生物识别方法，使用智能手机采集图像，通过多阶段计算机视觉流程提取特征，SVM分类器在混合品种猪群中达到98.12%识别精度，平均处理时间8.3秒。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统猪只识别方法（耳标、芯片）不可靠、成本高且主要针对纯种猪，不适用于小规模养殖户，需要开发低成本、非侵入性的替代方案。

Method: 使用标准智能手机和简单背光采集800张猪耳图像，开发多阶段计算机视觉流程增强静脉可见性，提取结构和空间特征生成生物特征签名，使用机器学习模型进行分类。

Result: 支持向量机（SVM）在混合品种猪群中达到最高识别精度98.12%，从图像处理到分类的完整流程平均耗时8.3秒。

Conclusion: 该系统通过用永久性生物标记替代易损的物理标识，为养殖户提供了经济高效且无压力的动物识别方法，证实了耳静脉生物识别技术在数字化畜牧管理中的实用性。

Abstract: Accurate livestock identification is a cornerstone of modern farming: it
supports health monitoring, breeding programs, and productivity tracking.
However, common pig identification methods, such as ear tags and microchips,
are often unreliable, costly, target pure breeds, and thus impractical for
small-scale farmers. To address this gap, we propose a noninvasive biometric
identification approach that leverages uniqueness of the auricular vein
patterns. To this end, we have collected 800 ear images from 20 mixed-breed
pigs (Landrace cross Pietrain and Duroc cross Pietrain), captured using a
standard smartphone and simple back lighting. A multistage computer vision
pipeline was developed to enhance vein visibility, extract structural and
spatial features, and generate biometric signatures. These features were then
classified using machine learning models. Support Vector Machines (SVM)
achieved the highest accuracy: correctly identifying pigs with 98.12% precision
across mixed-breed populations. The entire process from image processing to
classification was completed in an average of 8.3 seconds, demonstrating
feasibility for real-time farm deployment. We believe that by replacing fragile
physical identifiers with permanent biological markers, this system provides
farmers with a cost-effective and stress-free method of animal identification.
More broadly, the findings confirm the practicality of auricular vein
biometrics for digitizing livestock management, reinforcing its potential to
extend the benefits of precision farming to resource-constrained agricultural
communities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在密集和遮挡场景中，传统的基于检测的计数方法会失败，需要密度图估计方法来进行多类别对象计数。

Method: 使用Twins金字塔视觉transformer作为骨干网络，构建专门的多类计数头，采用多尺度解码方法，并添加基于分割的类别聚焦模块来抑制训练时的类别间串扰。

Result: 在VisDrone和iSAID基准测试中表现优于先前的多类别人群计数方法（MAE分别降低33%、43%和64%），与YOLOv11的对比证明了在密集场景中人群计数方法的必要性。

Conclusion: 该方法通过区域损失将多类人群计数扩展到新领域，应用于生物多样性监测数据集，展示了为保护工作提供信息和实现可扩展生态洞察的能力。

Abstract: Density map estimation can be used to estimate object counts in dense and
occluded scenes where discrete counting-by-detection methods fail. We propose a
multicategory counting framework that leverages a Twins pyramid
vision-transformer backbone and a specialised multi-class counting head built
on a state-of-the-art multiscale decoding approach. A two-task design adds a
segmentation-based Category Focus Module, suppressing inter-category cross-talk
at training time. Training and evaluation on the VisDrone and iSAID benchmarks
demonstrates superior performance versus prior multicategory crowd-counting
approaches (33%, 43% and 64% reduction to MAE), and the comparison with YOLOv11
underscores the necessity of crowd counting methods in dense scenes. The
method's regional loss opens up multi-class crowd counting to new domains,
demonstrated through the application to a biodiversity monitoring dataset,
highlighting its capacity to inform conservation efforts and enable scalable
ecological insights.

TL;DR: TempoControl是一种无需重新训练或额外监督的方法，通过优化交叉注意力图来实现视频生成中的时间对齐控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成视频模型缺乏细粒度时间控制，无法让用户指定特定视觉元素在生成序列中出现的时间。

Method: 利用文本到视频扩散模型中的交叉注意力图，通过相关性、能量和熵三个互补原则来引导概念的时间安排。

Result: 该方法能够精确控制时间安排，同时确保高质量和多样性的视频生成，适用于单/多对象时间重排序、动作和音频对齐生成等应用。

Conclusion: TempoControl为生成视频模型提供了有效的时间控制能力，无需重新训练即可实现精确的时间对齐。

Abstract: Recent advances in generative video models have enabled the creation of
high-quality videos based on natural language prompts. However, these models
frequently lack fine-grained temporal control, meaning they do not allow users
to specify when particular visual elements should appear within a generated
sequence. In this work, we introduce TempoControl, a method that allows for
temporal alignment of visual concepts during inference, without requiring
retraining or additional supervision. TempoControl utilizes cross-attention
maps, a key component of text-to-video diffusion models, to guide the timing of
concepts through a novel optimization approach. Our method steers attention
using three complementary principles: aligning its temporal shape with a
control signal (via correlation), amplifying it where visibility is needed (via
energy), and maintaining spatial focus (via entropy). TempoControl allows
precise control over timing while ensuring high video quality and diversity. We
demonstrate its effectiveness across various video generation applications,
including temporal reordering for single and multiple objects, as well as
action and audio-aligned generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了RewardMap框架，通过密集奖励信号和多阶段强化学习解决多模态大语言模型在细粒度视觉推理任务中的稀疏奖励和不稳定优化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs在结构化信息丰富的场景（如交通地图）中的空间推理能力不足，传统RL方法因稀疏奖励和优化不稳定而受阻。

Method: 构建ReasonMap-Plus数据集提供密集奖励信号，提出RewardMap多阶段RL框架，包含难度感知奖励设计和从简单感知到复杂推理的多阶段训练策略。

Result: 在ReasonMap和ReasonMap-Plus上实验显示RewardMap各组件均带来性能提升，组合使用效果最佳，在6个基准测试上平均提升3.47%。

Conclusion: RewardMap有效提升了MLLMs的视觉理解和推理能力，证明了密集奖励和多阶段RL策略在细粒度视觉推理任务中的有效性。

Abstract: Fine-grained visual reasoning remains a core challenge for multimodal large
language models (MLLMs). The recently introduced ReasonMap highlights this gap
by showing that even advanced MLLMs struggle with spatial reasoning in
structured and information-rich settings such as transit maps, a task of clear
practical and scientific importance. However, standard reinforcement learning
(RL) on such tasks is impeded by sparse rewards and unstable optimization. To
address this, we first construct ReasonMap-Plus, an extended dataset that
introduces dense reward signals through Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks,
enabling effective cold-start training of fine-grained visual understanding
skills. Next, we propose RewardMap, a multi-stage RL framework designed to
improve both visual understanding and reasoning capabilities of MLLMs.
RewardMap incorporates two key designs. First, we introduce a difficulty-aware
reward design that incorporates detail rewards, directly tackling the sparse
rewards while providing richer supervision. Second, we propose a multi-stage RL
scheme that bootstraps training from simple perception to complex reasoning
tasks, offering a more effective cold-start strategy than conventional
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Experiments on ReasonMap and ReasonMap-Plus
demonstrate that each component of RewardMap contributes to consistent
performance gains, while their combination yields the best results. Moreover,
models trained with RewardMap achieve an average improvement of 3.47% across 6
benchmarks spanning spatial reasoning, fine-grained visual reasoning, and
general tasks beyond transit maps, underscoring enhanced visual understanding
and reasoning capabilities.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DragFlow是首个有效利用FLUX强大先验进行拖拽式图像编辑的框架，通过区域级编辑范式和仿射变换解决了DiT特征结构化不足的问题，在拖拽基准测试中达到新的SOTA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成模型从UNet-based DDPMs转向更可扩展的DiT with flow matching（如SD3.5、FLUX），生成先验显著增强，但拖拽式编辑尚未从中受益。传统方法在目标区域存在失真问题，因为早期基础模型的先验不足以将优化后的潜在向量投影回自然图像流形。

Method: 1. 引入区域级编辑范式，使用仿射变换提供更丰富一致的特征监督；2. 集成预训练的开域个性化适配器（如IP-Adapter）增强主体一致性；3. 通过梯度掩码硬约束保持背景保真度；4. 使用多模态大语言模型解决任务歧义。

Result: 在DragBench-DR和ReD Bench上的广泛实验表明，DragFlow超越了基于点和基于区域的基线方法，在拖拽式图像编辑中设定了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: DragFlow成功利用FLUX的强大先验，通过区域级编辑范式解决了DiT特征结构化不足的问题，为拖拽式图像编辑带来了实质性改进。

Abstract: Drag-based image editing has long suffered from distortions in the target
region, largely because the priors of earlier base models, Stable Diffusion,
are insufficient to project optimized latents back onto the natural image
manifold. With the shift from UNet-based DDPMs to more scalable DiT with flow
matching (e.g., SD3.5, FLUX), generative priors have become significantly
stronger, enabling advances across diverse editing tasks. However, drag-based
editing has yet to benefit from these stronger priors. This work proposes the
first framework to effectively harness FLUX's rich prior for drag-based
editing, dubbed DragFlow, achieving substantial gains over baselines. We first
show that directly applying point-based drag editing to DiTs performs poorly:
unlike the highly compressed features of UNets, DiT features are insufficiently
structured to provide reliable guidance for point-wise motion supervision. To
overcome this limitation, DragFlow introduces a region-based editing paradigm,
where affine transformations enable richer and more consistent feature
supervision. Additionally, we integrate pretrained open-domain personalization
adapters (e.g., IP-Adapter) to enhance subject consistency, while preserving
background fidelity through gradient mask-based hard constraints. Multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) are further employed to resolve task ambiguities.
For evaluation, we curate a novel Region-based Dragging benchmark (ReD Bench)
featuring region-level dragging instructions. Extensive experiments on
DragBench-DR and ReD Bench show that DragFlow surpasses both point-based and
region-based baselines, setting a new state-of-the-art in drag-based image
editing. Code and datasets will be publicly available upon publication.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频大语言模型存在"大海捞针"问题，大量视觉token耗尽模型上下文窗口。现有解决方案通过选择稀疏帧来减少token数量，但丢弃了重要的时间动态信息

Method: 提出F2C方法：1）从孤立关键帧扩展到关键片段选择；2）采用自适应分辨率策略，动态平衡空间分辨率和片段长度，保持每个视频固定token数量

Result: 在三个长视频基准测试上，F2C方法比均匀采样分别提升8.1%、5.6%和10.3%的性能

Conclusion: 保持时间连贯性在帧选择中至关重要，为视频大语言模型扩展到实际视频理解应用提供了实用路径

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable results on a
variety of vision language tasks, yet their practical use is limited by the
"needle in a haystack" problem: the massive number of visual tokens produced
from raw video frames exhausts the model's context window. Existing solutions
alleviate this issue by selecting a sparse set of frames, thereby reducing
token count, but such frame-wise selection discards essential temporal
dynamics, leading to suboptimal reasoning about motion and event continuity. In
this work we systematically explore the impact of temporal information and
demonstrate that extending selection from isolated key frames to key clips,
which are short, temporally coherent segments, improves video understanding. To
maintain a fixed computational budget while accommodating the larger token
footprint of clips, we propose an adaptive resolution strategy that dynamically
balances spatial resolution and clip length, ensuring a constant token count
per video. Experiments on three long-form video benchmarks demonstrate that our
training-free approach, F2C, outperforms uniform sampling up to 8.1%, 5.6%, and
10.3% on Video-MME, LongVideoBench and MLVU benchmarks, respectively. These
results highlight the importance of preserving temporal coherence in frame
selection and provide a practical pathway for scaling Video LLMs to real world
video understanding applications. Project webpage is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器学习和可穿戴传感器的发展，需要在真实条件下准确评估人体运动，这对远程医疗、运动科学和康复至关重要。研究旨在比较视频和IMU两种技术的性能差异。

Method: 使用VIDIMU数据集，包含13种临床相关日常活动，同时用商用摄像机和5个IMU采集数据。评估了MotionAGFormer、MotionBERT、MMPose 2D-to-3D姿态提升和NVIDIA BodyTrack等深度学习框架，与基于IMU数据的OpenSim逆运动学计算结果进行比较。

Result: MotionAGFormer表现最优，总体RMSE为9.27±4.80度，MAE为7.86±4.18度，Pearson相关系数0.86±0.15，决定系数R²为0.67±0.28。两种技术都可行，但存在成本、可访问性和精度等方面的权衡。

Conclusion: 研究阐明了现成视频模型在健康成人中提供临床可行运动学的位置，以及它们落后于IMU估计的位置，为开发稳健、经济高效且用户友好的远程医疗解决方案提供了宝贵指南。

Abstract: Advances in machine learning and wearable sensors offer new opportunities for
capturing and analyzing human movement outside specialized laboratories.
Accurate assessment of human movement under real-world conditions is essential
for telemedicine, sports science, and rehabilitation. This preclinical
benchmark compares monocular video-based 3D human pose estimation models with
inertial measurement units (IMUs), leveraging the VIDIMU dataset containing a
total of 13 clinically relevant daily activities which were captured using both
commodity video cameras and five IMUs. During this initial study only healthy
subjects were recorded, so results cannot be generalized to pathological
cohorts. Joint angles derived from state-of-the-art deep learning frameworks
(MotionAGFormer, MotionBERT, MMPose 2D-to-3D pose lifting, and NVIDIA
BodyTrack) were evaluated against joint angles computed from IMU data using
OpenSim inverse kinematics following the Human3.6M dataset format with 17
keypoints. Among them, MotionAGFormer demonstrated superior performance,
achieving the lowest overall RMSE ($9.27\deg \pm 4.80\deg$) and MAE ($7.86\deg
\pm 4.18\deg$), as well as the highest Pearson correlation ($0.86 \pm 0.15$)
and the highest coefficient of determination $R^{2}$ ($0.67 \pm 0.28$). The
results reveal that both technologies are viable for out-of-the-lab kinematic
assessment. However, they also highlight key trade-offs between video- and
sensor-based approaches including costs, accessibility, and precision. This
study clarifies where off-the-shelf video models already provide clinically
promising kinematics in healthy adults and where they lag behind IMU-based
estimates while establishing valuable guidelines for researchers and clinicians
seeking to develop robust, cost-effective, and user-friendly solutions for
telehealth and remote patient monitoring.

Motivation: 解决从脑活动重建视觉信息中的跨被试泛化挑战，包括被试间神经表征差异和大脑对复杂视觉输入的抽象语义编码问题。

Method: 整合互补适配器的扩散方法：AutoKL处理低级特征，CLIP处理语义特征；CLIP适配器在Stable Diffusion生成图像和COCO字幕对上训练；跨被试时仅微调17%参数（全连接层）。

Result: 在轻量级GPU（3个RTX 4090）上每个被试仅需1小时训练，即超越现有方法，实现最先进的性能。

Conclusion: NeuroSwift通过高效参数微调和互补特征适配，成功解决了跨被试视觉重建的挑战，为理解视觉神经机制提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Reconstructing visual information from brain activity via computer vision
technology provides an intuitive understanding of visual neural mechanisms.
Despite progress in decoding fMRI data with generative models, achieving
accurate cross-subject reconstruction of visual stimuli remains challenging and
computationally demanding. This difficulty arises from inter-subject
variability in neural representations and the brain's abstract encoding of core
semantic features in complex visual inputs. To address these challenges, we
propose NeuroSwift, which integrates complementary adapters via diffusion:
AutoKL for low-level features and CLIP for semantics. NeuroSwift's CLIP Adapter
is trained on Stable Diffusion generated images paired with COCO captions to
emulate higher visual cortex encoding. For cross-subject generalization, we
pretrain on one subject and then fine-tune only 17 percent of parameters (fully
connected layers) for new subjects, while freezing other components. This
enables state-of-the-art performance with only one hour of training per subject
on lightweight GPUs (three RTX 4090), and it outperforms existing methods.

Motivation: CLIP模型在细粒度图像分类任务中表现受限，因为它依赖粗粒度的全局特征，而忽略了微观局部线索。现有方法通过LLM描述对齐CLIP的[CLS]token，但缺乏空间精度。

Method: 提出Saliency-Oriented Attention Pooling (SOAP)机制构建显著性引导的[FG]token，与全局[CLS]token融合；使用双头LLM派生分类器（冻结和可学习）提供稳定文本先验；开发动态知识聚合，结合固定先验和TokenFusion演化logits迭代优化伪标签。

Conclusion: microCLIP能够有效挖掘CLIP中的潜在细粒度信号，显著提升细粒度分类性能，同时保持轻量级适配的优势。

Abstract: Unsupervised adaptation of CLIP-based vision-language models (VLMs) for
fine-grained image classification requires sensitivity to microscopic local
cues. While CLIP exhibits strong zero-shot transfer, its reliance on coarse
global features restricts its performance on fine-grained classification tasks.
Prior efforts inject fine-grained knowledge by aligning large language model
(LLM) descriptions with the CLIP $\texttt{[CLS]}$ token; however, this approach
overlooks spatial precision. We propose $\textbf{microCLIP}$, a self-training
framework that jointly refines CLIP's visual and textual representations using
fine-grained cues. At its core is Saliency-Oriented Attention Pooling (SOAP)
within a lightweight TokenFusion module, which builds a saliency-guided
$\texttt{[FG]}$ token from patch embeddings and fuses it with the global
$\texttt{[CLS]}$ token for coarse-fine alignment. To stabilize adaptation, we
introduce a two-headed LLM-derived classifier: a frozen classifier that, via
multi-view alignment, provides a stable text-based prior for pseudo-labeling,
and a learnable classifier initialized from LLM descriptions and fine-tuned
with TokenFusion. We further develop Dynamic Knowledge Aggregation, which
convexly combines fixed LLM/CLIP priors with TokenFusion's evolving logits to
iteratively refine pseudo-labels. Together, these components uncover latent
fine-grained signals in CLIP, yielding a consistent $2.90\%$ average accuracy
gain across 13 fine-grained benchmarks while requiring only light adaptation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI生成视频技术的快速发展，需要有效的检测工具来减轻错误信息和声誉损害等社会风险，同时检测模型需要提供可解释的解释以确保监管机构和终端用户的透明度。

Method: 使用群体相对策略优化(GRPO)微调多模态大语言模型(Qwen-VL)，构建包含14万真实和AI生成视频的挑战性数据集，设计专门针对时间伪影和生成复杂度的奖励模型。

Result: VidGuard-R1在现有基准测试中实现了最先进的零样本性能，额外训练后准确率超过95%，并能产生精确且可解释的预测理由。

Conclusion: VidGuard-R1通过结合高精度检测和可解释推理，为解决AI生成视频带来的社会风险提供了有效的技术解决方案。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of AI-generated videos, there is an urgent need
for effective detection tools to mitigate societal risks such as misinformation
and reputational harm. In addition to accurate classification, it is essential
that detection models provide interpretable explanations to ensure transparency
for regulators and end users. To address these challenges, we introduce
VidGuard-R1, the first video authenticity detector that fine-tunes a
multi-modal large language model (MLLM) using group relative policy
optimization (GRPO). Our model delivers both highly accurate judgments and
insightful reasoning. We curate a challenging dataset of 140k real and
AI-generated videos produced by state-of-the-art generation models, carefully
designing the generation process to maximize discrimination difficulty. We then
fine-tune Qwen-VL using GRPO with two specialized reward models that target
temporal artifacts and generation complexity. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that VidGuard-R1 achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on existing
benchmarks, with additional training pushing accuracy above 95%. Case studies
further show that VidGuard-R1 produces precise and interpretable rationales
behind its predictions. The code is publicly available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需长视频监督或重新训练的方法，通过利用教师模型的丰富知识为自生成长视频中的采样片段提供指导，有效缓解长时视频生成中的质量退化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在图像和视频生成方面取得了突破性进展，但基于transformer架构的计算成本过高，特别是在生成长视频时。现有的自回归方法通过从短时双向教师模型蒸馏来生成长视频，但由于教师模型无法合成长视频，学生模型在超出训练范围时会出现明显的质量退化。

Method: 利用教师模型的丰富知识，为从自生成长视频中采样的片段提供指导。该方法保持时间一致性，将视频长度扩展到教师能力的20倍以上，避免了过度曝光和误差累积等问题，且无需像先前方法那样重新计算重叠帧。

Result: 当扩大计算规模时，该方法能够生成长达4分15秒的视频，相当于基础模型位置嵌入支持的最大跨度的99.9%，比基线模型长50多倍。在标准基准测试和改进的基准测试上的实验表明，该方法在保真度和一致性方面都显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了长时视频生成中的质量退化问题，无需长视频监督或重新训练，能够生成高质量的长视频，在保真度和时间一致性方面表现优异。

Abstract: Diffusion models have revolutionized image and video generation, achieving
unprecedented visual quality. However, their reliance on transformer
architectures incurs prohibitively high computational costs, particularly when
extending generation to long videos. Recent work has explored autoregressive
formulations for long video generation, typically by distilling from
short-horizon bidirectional teachers. Nevertheless, given that teacher models
cannot synthesize long videos, the extrapolation of student models beyond their
training horizon often leads to pronounced quality degradation, arising from
the compounding of errors within the continuous latent space. In this paper, we
propose a simple yet effective approach to mitigate quality degradation in
long-horizon video generation without requiring supervision from long-video
teachers or retraining on long video datasets. Our approach centers on
exploiting the rich knowledge of teacher models to provide guidance for the
student model through sampled segments drawn from self-generated long videos.
Our method maintains temporal consistency while scaling video length by up to
20x beyond teacher's capability, avoiding common issues such as over-exposure
and error-accumulation without recomputing overlapping frames like previous
methods. When scaling up the computation, our method shows the capability of
generating videos up to 4 minutes and 15 seconds, equivalent to 99.9% of the
maximum span supported by our base model's position embedding and more than 50x
longer than that of our baseline model. Experiments on standard benchmarks and
our proposed improved benchmark demonstrate that our approach substantially
outperforms baseline methods in both fidelity and consistency. Our long-horizon
videos demo can be found at https://self-forcing-plus-plus.github.io/

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频生成模型在物理交互方面存在不足，缺乏物理基础的控制机制，限制了在机器人学和决策制定中的应用潜力。

Method: 提出两阶段训练策略，逐步移除未来运动监督，使用物体掩码训练视频扩散模型，结合低级运动控制和高级文本条件。

Result: 在合成场景和真实场景中都显著改善了物体交互效果，在复杂动态现象合成方面表现出色，超越了同类规模模型。

Conclusion: KineMask通过物理引导的视频生成方法有效解决了物体交互的物理合理性，证明了低级和高级条件在视频扩散模型中的互补作用。

Abstract: Recent models for video generation have achieved remarkable progress and are
now deployed in film, social media production, and advertising. Beyond their
creative potential, such models also hold promise as world simulators for
robotics and embodied decision making. Despite strong advances, however,
current approaches still struggle to generate physically plausible object
interactions and lack physics-grounded control mechanisms. To address this
limitation, we introduce KineMask, an approach for physics-guided video
generation that enables realistic rigid body control, interactions, and
effects. Given a single image and a specified object velocity, our method
generates videos with inferred motions and future object interactions. We
propose a two-stage training strategy that gradually removes future motion
supervision via object masks. Using this strategy we train video diffusion
models (VDMs) on synthetic scenes of simple interactions and demonstrate
significant improvements of object interactions in real scenes. Furthermore,
KineMask integrates low-level motion control with high-level textual
conditioning via predictive scene descriptions, leading to effective support
for synthesis of complex dynamical phenomena. Extensive experiments show that
KineMask achieves strong improvements over recent models of comparable size.
Ablation studies further highlight the complementary roles of low- and
high-level conditioning in VDMs. Our code, model, and data will be made
publicly available.

Conclusion: 多模态细粒度动作模拟能够有效提升机器人精细控制的性能，为通用家用机器人提供了更可靠的模拟基础。

Abstract: Current video models fail as world model as they lack fine-graiend control.
General-purpose household robots require real-time fine motor control to handle
delicate tasks and urgent situations. In this work, we introduce fine-grained
multimodal actions to capture such precise control. We consider senses of
proprioception, kinesthesia, force haptics, and muscle activation. Such
multimodal senses naturally enables fine-grained interactions that are
difficult to simulate with text-conditioned generative models. To effectively
simulate fine-grained multisensory actions, we develop a feature learning
paradigm that aligns these modalities while preserving the unique information
each modality provides. We further propose a regularization scheme to enhance
causality of the action trajectory features in representing intricate
interaction dynamics. Experiments show that incorporating multimodal senses
improves simulation accuracy and reduces temporal drift. Extensive ablation
studies and downstream applications demonstrate the effectiveness and
practicality of our work.

Motivation: 解决多模态语言模型在视频理解中因上下文长度限制而错过关键过渡帧、在长时间尺度上保持连贯性困难的问题。

Method: 采用硬件感知的混合注意力方法：文本使用密集注意力，视频使用原生稀疏注意力(NSA)，通过端到端训练在216K视频指令数据集上适配Qwen2.5-VL。

Result: 相比token压缩和训练无关的稀疏基线方法，VideoNSA在长视频理解、时序推理和空间基准测试中表现更优，可靠扩展到128K token。

Conclusion: VideoNSA通过可学习的组合稀疏注意力诱导动态注意力机制，在固定预算下找到最优的全局-局部注意力分配，并显示任务依赖的分支使用模式。

Abstract: Video understanding in multimodal language models remains limited by context
length: models often miss key transition frames and struggle to maintain
coherence across long time scales. To address this, we adapt Native Sparse
Attention (NSA) to video-language models. Our method, VideoNSA, adapts
Qwen2.5-VL through end-to-end training on a 216K video instruction dataset. We
employ a hardware-aware hybrid approach to attention, preserving dense
attention for text, while employing NSA for video. Compared to
token-compression and training-free sparse baselines, VideoNSA achieves
improved performance on long-video understanding, temporal reasoning, and
spatial benchmarks. Further ablation analysis reveals four key findings: (1)
reliable scaling to 128K tokens; (2) an optimal global-local attention
allocation at a fixed budget; (3) task-dependent branch usage patterns; and (4)
the learnable combined sparse attention help induce dynamic attention sinks.

TL;DR: NoiseShift是一种无需训练的方法，通过重新校准基于分辨率的噪声水平来解决扩散模型在低分辨率生成时的质量问题，显著提升图像生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的高分辨率文本到图像扩散模型在生成低分辨率图像时效果不佳，无法为不需要高分辨率图像的用户提供经济高效的解决方案。研究发现噪声调度器在不同分辨率下具有不等的感知效果，导致训练-测试不匹配。

Method: 提出NoiseShift方法，根据分辨率大小重新校准去噪器的噪声水平。该方法无需修改模型架构或采样计划，与现有模型兼容。

Result: 在Stable Diffusion 3、Stable Diffusion 3.5和Flux-Dev上应用NoiseShift后，低分辨率图像质量显著提升。在LAION-COCO数据集上，FID指标平均提升：SD3.5 15.89%、SD3 8.56%、Flux-Dev 2.44%；在CelebA数据集上，FID指标平均提升：SD3.5 10.36%、SD3 5.19%、Flux-Dev 3.02%。

Conclusion: NoiseShift能有效缓解分辨率相关的伪影，提升低分辨率图像生成质量，为扩散模型提供更好的分辨率泛化能力。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models trained on a fixed set of resolutions often
fail to generalize, even when asked to generate images at lower resolutions
than those seen during training. High-resolution text-to-image generators are
currently unable to easily offer an out-of-the-box budget-efficient alternative
to their users who might not need high-resolution images. We identify a key
technical insight in diffusion models that when addressed can help tackle this
limitation: Noise schedulers have unequal perceptual effects across
resolutions. The same level of noise removes disproportionately more signal
from lower-resolution images than from high-resolution images, leading to a
train-test mismatch. We propose NoiseShift, a training-free method that
recalibrates the noise level of the denoiser conditioned on resolution size.
NoiseShift requires no changes to model architecture or sampling schedule and
is compatible with existing models. When applied to Stable Diffusion 3, Stable
Diffusion 3.5, and Flux-Dev, quality at low resolutions is significantly
improved. On LAION-COCO, NoiseShift improves SD3.5 by 15.89%, SD3 by 8.56%, and
Flux-Dev by 2.44% in FID on average. On CelebA, NoiseShift improves SD3.5 by
10.36%, SD3 by 5.19%, and Flux-Dev by 3.02% in FID on average. These results
demonstrate the effectiveness of NoiseShift in mitigating resolution-dependent
artifacts and enhancing the quality of low-resolution image generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何从视频中推断需要时间信息才能判断的动态物理属性，如弹性、粘度和动态摩擦。

Method: 收集了三个物理属性的新视频数据集；探索了三种推理方法：基于经典计算机视觉技术的oracle方法、使用视觉提示和可训练提示向量的简单读出机制、以及多模态大语言模型的提示策略。

Result: 生成式或自监督训练的视频基础模型表现相似，但不及oracle方法；MLLMs目前表现较差，但通过合适的提示可以改善性能。

Conclusion: 视频基础模型在预测动态物理属性方面有潜力，但仍有改进空间，特别是MLLMs需要更好的提示策略来提升性能。

Abstract: We study the task of predicting dynamic physical properties from videos. More
specifically, we consider physical properties that require temporal information
to be inferred: elasticity of a bouncing object, viscosity of a flowing liquid,
and dynamic friction of an object sliding on a surface. To this end, we make
the following contributions: (i) We collect a new video dataset for each
physical property, consisting of synthetic training and testing splits, as well
as a real split for real world evaluation. (ii) We explore three ways to infer
the physical property from videos: (a) an oracle method where we supply the
visual cues that intrinsically reflect the property using classical computer
vision techniques; (b) a simple read out mechanism using a visual prompt and
trainable prompt vector for cross-attention on pre-trained video generative and
self-supervised models; and (c) prompt strategies for Multi-modal Large
Language Models (MLLMs). (iii) We show that video foundation models trained in
a generative or self-supervised manner achieve a similar performance, though
behind that of the oracle, and MLLMs are currently inferior to the other
models, though their performance can be improved through suitable prompting.

Conclusion: 提出的对象感知多模态框架能够有效链接声音与参与物体，在声音对象检测任务中表现出色，为理解日常物体交互提供了新方法。

Abstract: Can a model distinguish between the sound of a spoon hitting a hardwood floor
versus a carpeted one? Everyday object interactions produce sounds unique to
the objects involved. We introduce the sounding object detection task to
evaluate a model's ability to link these sounds to the objects directly
involved. Inspired by human perception, our multimodal object-aware framework
learns from in-the-wild egocentric videos. To encourage an object-centric
approach, we first develop an automatic pipeline to compute segmentation masks
of the objects involved to guide the model's focus during training towards the
most informative regions of the interaction. A slot attention visual encoder is
used to further enforce an object prior. We demonstrate state of the art
performance on our new task along with existing multimodal action understanding
tasks.

Motivation: 随着3D场景表示方法如NeRF和3DGS的普及，解决其安全漏洞变得至关重要。本文分析了3DGS对图像级投毒攻击的鲁棒性。

Method: 使用核密度估计(KDE)识别低密度区域，在这些区域战略性地注入高斯点来嵌入视角依赖的虚假物体，同时采用自适应噪声策略破坏多视角一致性。

Result: 广泛的实验表明，该方法在性能上优于现有最先进技术，能够从投毒视角清晰显示虚假物体，同时对无辜视角影响最小。

Conclusion: 提出了一种有效的3DGS投毒攻击方法，并建立了基于KDE的评估协议，为未来研究提供了客观的基准测试框架。

Abstract: 3D scene representation methods like Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D
Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have significantly advanced novel view synthesis. As
these methods become prevalent, addressing their vulnerabilities becomes
critical. We analyze 3DGS robustness against image-level poisoning attacks and
propose a novel density-guided poisoning method. Our method strategically
injects Gaussian points into low-density regions identified via Kernel Density
Estimation (KDE), embedding viewpoint-dependent illusory objects clearly
visible from poisoned views while minimally affecting innocent views.
Additionally, we introduce an adaptive noise strategy to disrupt multi-view
consistency, further enhancing attack effectiveness. We propose a KDE-based
evaluation protocol to assess attack difficulty systematically, enabling
objective benchmarking for future research. Extensive experiments demonstrate
our method's superior performance compared to state-of-the-art techniques.

Conclusion: 提出的FOCUS方法在多个模型上实现了最先进的多主体保真度，为多主体文本到图像生成提供了统一的理论框架和实用解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models excel on single-entity prompts but struggle with
multi-subject descriptions, often showing attribute leakage, identity
entanglement, and subject omissions. We introduce the first theoretical
framework with a principled, optimizable objective for steering sampling
dynamics toward multi-subject fidelity. Viewing flow matching (FM) through
stochastic optimal control (SOC), we formulate subject disentanglement as
control over a trained FM sampler. This yields two architecture-agnostic
algorithms: (i) a training-free test-time controller that perturbs the base
velocity with a single-pass update, and (ii) Adjoint Matching, a lightweight
fine-tuning rule that regresses a control network to a backward adjoint signal
while preserving base-model capabilities. The same formulation unifies prior
attention heuristics, extends to diffusion models via a flow-diffusion
correspondence, and provides the first fine-tuning route explicitly designed
for multi-subject fidelity. Empirically, on Stable Diffusion 3.5, FLUX, and
Stable Diffusion XL, both algorithms consistently improve multi-subject
alignment while maintaining base-model style. Test-time control runs
efficiently on commodity GPUs, and fine-tuned controllers trained on limited
prompts generalize to unseen ones. We further highlight FOCUS (Flow Optimal
Control for Unentangled Subjects), which achieves state-of-the-art
multi-subject fidelity across models.

Abstract: Reliable long-range flight of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in GNSS-denied
environments is challenging: integrating odometry leads to drift, loop closures
are unavailable in previously unseen areas and embedded platforms provide
limited computational power. We present a fully onboard UAV system developed
for the SPRIN-D Funke Fully Autonomous Flight Challenge, which required 9 km
long-range waypoint navigation below 25 m AGL (Above Ground Level) without GNSS
or prior dense mapping. The system integrates perception, mapping, planning,
and control with a lightweight drift-correction method that matches
LiDAR-derived local heightmaps to a prior geo-data heightmap via
gradient-template matching and fuses the evidence with odometry in a clustered
particle filter. Deployed during the competition, the system executed
kilometer-scale flights across urban, forest, and open-field terrain and
reduced drift substantially relative to raw odometry, while running in real
time on CPU-only hardware. We describe the system architecture, the
localization pipeline, and the competition evaluation, and we report practical
insights from field deployment that inform the design of GNSS-denied UAV

Conclusion: 提出的自适应膨胀策略相比传统固定椭圆障碍物表示减少了保守性，同时确保了船舶的安全导航能力。

Abstract: Safe motion planning is essential for autonomous vessel operations,
especially in challenging spaces such as narrow inland waterways. However,
conventional motion planning approaches are often computationally intensive or
overly conservative. This paper proposes a safe motion planning strategy
combining Model Predictive Control (MPC) and Control Barrier Functions (CBFs).
We introduce a time-varying inflated ellipse obstacle representation, where the
inflation radius is adjusted depending on the relative position and attitude
between the vessel and the obstacle. The proposed adaptive inflation reduces
the conservativeness of the controller compared to traditional fixed-ellipsoid
obstacle formulations. The MPC solution provides an approximate motion plan,
and high-order CBFs ensure the vessel's safety using the varying inflation
radius. Simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate that the proposed
strategy enables the fully-actuated autonomous robot vessel to navigate through
narrow spaces in real time and resolve potential deadlocks, all while ensuring
safety.

Abstract: State estimation techniques for continuum robots (CRs) typically involve
using computationally complex dynamic models, simplistic shape approximations,
or are limited to quasi-static methods. These limitations can be sensitive to
unmodelled disturbances acting on the robot. Inspired by a factor-graph
optimization paradigm, this work introduces a continuous-time stochastic state
estimation framework for continuum robots. We introduce factors based on
continuous-time kinematics that are corrupted by a white noise Gaussian process
(GP). By using a simple robot model paired with high-rate sensing, we show
adaptability to unmodelled external forces and data dropout. The result
contains an estimate of the mean and covariance for the robot's pose, velocity,
and strain, each of which can be interpolated continuously in time or space.
This same interpolation scheme can be used during estimation, allowing for
inclusion of measurements on states that are not explicitly estimated. Our
method's inherent sparsity leads to a linear solve complexity with respect to
time and interpolation queries in constant time. We demonstrate our method on a
CR with gyroscope and pose sensors, highlighting its versatility in real-world

TL;DR: VENTURA是一个视觉语言导航系统，通过微调互联网预训练的扩散模型进行路径规划，生成视觉路径掩码来指导机器人导航，在真实世界评估中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有视觉语言模型在机器人导航任务中难以适应的问题，因为动作空间差异和预训练目标限制了向机器人任务的迁移性。

Method: 使用图像扩散模型生成路径掩码作为视觉规划，通过轻量级行为克隆策略将视觉规划转化为可执行轨迹，利用自监督跟踪模型和VLM增强的标注进行训练。

Result: 在真实世界评估中，VENTURA在物体到达、避障和地形偏好任务上优于最先进的基础模型基线，成功率提高33%，碰撞减少54%，并能泛化到未见过的任务组合。

Conclusion: VENTURA展示了通过视觉规划方法实现机器人导航的有效性，具有强大的泛化能力和组合能力。

Abstract: Robots must adapt to diverse human instructions and operate safely in
unstructured, open-world environments. Recent Vision-Language models (VLMs)
offer strong priors for grounding language and perception, but remain difficult
to steer for navigation due to differences in action spaces and pretraining
objectives that hamper transferability to robotics tasks. Towards addressing
this, we introduce VENTURA, a vision-language navigation system that finetunes
internet-pretrained image diffusion models for path planning. Instead of
directly predicting low-level actions, VENTURA generates a path mask (i.e. a
visual plan) in image space that captures fine-grained, context-aware
navigation behaviors. A lightweight behavior-cloning policy grounds these
visual plans into executable trajectories, yielding an interface that follows
natural language instructions to generate diverse robot behaviors. To scale
training, we supervise on path masks derived from self-supervised tracking
models paired with VLM-augmented captions, avoiding manual pixel-level
annotation or highly engineered data collection setups. In extensive real-world
evaluations, VENTURA outperforms state-of-the-art foundation model baselines on
object reaching, obstacle avoidance, and terrain preference tasks, improving
success rates by 33% and reducing collisions by 54% across both seen and unseen
scenarios. Notably, we find that VENTURA generalizes to unseen combinations of
distinct tasks, revealing emergent compositional capabilities. Videos, code,

*Ulas Berk Karli,Ziyao Shangguan,Tesca FItzgerald*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: INSIGHT框架利用token级不确定性信号来预测VLA模型何时需要请求人类帮助，通过训练紧凑的Transformer分类器来映射不确定性序列到帮助触发信号。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的VLA模型缺乏内省机制来预测失败并请求人类监督，需要开发能够主动识别不确定性并寻求帮助的框架。

Method: 使用π₀-FAST作为基础模型，提取每个token的熵、对数概率以及基于Dirichlet的偶然和认知不确定性估计，训练Transformer分类器将这些序列映射到帮助触发信号。

Result: 研究发现强标签能捕捉细粒度不确定性动态以实现可靠的帮助检测，而弱标签虽然噪声较大，但在训练和评估对齐时仍具有竞争力。建模token级不确定性信号的时间演化比静态序列级分数具有更强的预测能力。

Conclusion: 这是对VLA中基于不确定性的内省机制的首个系统评估，为主动学习和通过选择性人类干预实现实时错误缓解开辟了未来途径。

Abstract: Recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models show strong generalization
capabilities, yet they lack introspective mechanisms for anticipating failures
and requesting help from a human supervisor. We present \textbf{INSIGHT}, a
learning framework for leveraging token-level uncertainty signals to predict
when a VLA should request help. Using $\pi_0$-FAST as the underlying model, we
extract per-token \emph{entropy}, \emph{log-probability}, and Dirichlet-based
estimates of \emph{aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty}, and train compact
transformer classifiers to map these sequences to help triggers. We explore
supervision regimes for strong or weak supervision, and extensively compare
them across in-distribution and out-of-distribution tasks. Our results show a
trade-off: strong labels enable models to capture fine-grained uncertainty
dynamics for reliable help detection, while weak labels, though noisier, still
support competitive introspection when training and evaluation are aligned,
offering a scalable path when dense annotation is impractical. Crucially, we
find that modeling the temporal evolution of token-level uncertainty signals
with transformers provides far greater predictive power than static
sequence-level scores. This study provides the first systematic evaluation of
uncertainty-based introspection in VLAs, opening future avenues for active
learning and for real-time error mitigation through selective human
intervention.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出动态抛物线控制屏障函数(DPCBF)解决非完整机器人在密集动态环境中CBF应用难题，通过动态调整抛物线边界提高QP可行性和导航成功率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CBF方法在非完整机器人密集动态环境中过于保守，常导致二次规划不可行，需要更灵活的避障约束

Method: 设计动态抛物线控制屏障函数，根据障碍物距离和相对速度动态调整抛物线顶点和曲率，形成更宽松的安全约束

Result: 在100个动态障碍物的密集环境中成功导航，显著提高导航成功率和QP可行性，优于基于碰撞锥的方法

Conclusion: DPCBF为非完整机器人在密集动态环境中的安全导航提供了有效解决方案，解决了传统方法的保守性问题

Abstract: Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) are a powerful tool for ensuring the safety
of autonomous systems, yet applying them to nonholonomic robots in cluttered,
dynamic environments remains an open challenge. State-of-the-art methods often
rely on collision-cone or velocity-obstacle constraints which, by only
considering the angle of the relative velocity, are inherently conservative and
can render the CBF-based quadratic program infeasible, particularly in dense
scenarios. To address this issue, we propose a Dynamic Parabolic Control
Barrier Function (DPCBF) that defines the safe set using a parabolic boundary.
The parabola's vertex and curvature dynamically adapt based on both the
distance to an obstacle and the magnitude of the relative velocity, creating a
less restrictive safety constraint. We prove that the proposed DPCBF is valid
for a kinematic bicycle model subject to input constraints. Extensive
comparative simulations demonstrate that our DPCBF-based controller
significantly enhances navigation success rates and QP feasibility compared to
baseline methods. Our approach successfully navigates through dense
environments with up to 100 dynamic obstacles, scenarios where collision
cone-based methods fail due to infeasibility.

TL;DR: 研究扩散策略在机器人模仿学习中学习运动学约束的能力，通过双手拾取任务分析数据集大小、质量和流形曲率对约束学习的影响


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然扩散策略在机器人模仿学习中表现出色，但任务性能不能可靠反映策略精确学习训练数据中约束的能力，需要研究扩散策略如何发现这些约束流形

Method: 通过双手拾取任务案例研究，分析数据集大小、数据集质量和流形曲率三个因素对训练策略的影响

Result: 扩散策略学习约束流形的粗略近似，数据集大小和质量的降低对学习产生负面影响，而流形曲率与约束满足和任务成功的关系不明确

Conclusion: 硬件评估验证了结果在现实世界中的适用性，扩散策略能够学习约束但受数据集特性影响

Abstract: Diffusion policies have shown impressive results in robot imitation learning,
even for tasks that require satisfaction of kinematic equality constraints.
However, task performance alone is not a reliable indicator of the policy's
ability to precisely learn constraints in the training data. To investigate, we
analyze how well diffusion policies discover these manifolds with a case study
on a bimanual pick-and-place task that encourages fulfillment of a kinematic
constraint for success. We study how three factors affect trained policies:
dataset size, dataset quality, and manifold curvature. Our experiments show
diffusion policies learn a coarse approximation of the constraint manifold with
learning affected negatively by decreases in both dataset size and quality. On
the other hand, the curvature of the constraint manifold showed inconclusive
correlations with both constraint satisfaction and task success. A hardware
evaluation verifies the applicability of our results in the real world. Project

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: AFFORD2ACT是一个基于视觉的机器人学习框架，通过文本提示和单张图像提取语义2D关键点，构建紧凑的38维状态策略，在15分钟内完成训练，在多样化真实世界操作任务中实现82%的成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于视觉的机器人学习中密集图像或点云输入计算量大、包含无关背景特征的问题，以及现有基于关键点方法依赖手动启发式或任务耦合选择，限制可扩展性和语义理解的问题。

Method: 采用三阶段流程：1) 可操作性过滤；2) 类别级关键点构建；3) 基于transformer的策略学习，包含嵌入门控机制来推理最相关的关键点。

Result: 在未见过的物体、新类别、背景和干扰物上实现了82%的成功率，显著提高了数据效率，无需本体感知或密集表示即可实时运行。

Conclusion: AFFORD2ACT框架通过可操作性引导的语义关键点提取，实现了高效、轻量级的机器人操作学习，在多样化的真实世界任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Vision-based robot learning often relies on dense image or point-cloud
inputs, which are computationally heavy and entangle irrelevant background
features. Existing keypoint-based approaches can focus on manipulation-centric
features and be lightweight, but either depend on manual heuristics or
task-coupled selection, limiting scalability and semantic understanding. To
address this, we propose AFFORD2ACT, an affordance-guided framework that
distills a minimal set of semantic 2D keypoints from a text prompt and a single
image. AFFORD2ACT follows a three-stage pipeline: affordance filtering,
category-level keypoint construction, and transformer-based policy learning
with embedded gating to reason about the most relevant keypoints, yielding a
compact 38-dimensional state policy that can be trained in 15 minutes, which
performs well in real-time without proprioception or dense representations.
Across diverse real-world manipulation tasks, AFFORD2ACT consistently improves
data efficiency, achieving an 82% success rate on unseen objects, novel
categories, backgrounds, and distractors.

Abstract: Robotic automation is accelerating scientific discovery by reducing manual
effort in laboratory workflows. However, precise manipulation of powders
remains challenging, particularly in tasks such as transport that demand
accuracy and stability. We propose a trajectory optimisation framework for
powder transport in laboratory settings, which integrates differentiable
physics simulation for accurate modelling of granular dynamics, low-dimensional
skill-space parameterisation to reduce optimisation complexity, and a
curriculum-based strategy that progressively refines task competence over long
horizons. This formulation enables end-to-end optimisation of contact-rich
robot trajectories while maintaining stability and convergence efficiency.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior
task success rates and stability compared to the reinforcement learning
baseline.

TL;DR: 开发了一种协作机器人引导系统，通过触觉反馈帮助定位肿瘤边界，在模拟乳房保留手术中改善切除边缘并降低手术难度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 乳房保留手术中肿瘤边界定位困难，因为肿瘤通常高度移动、不可触及且边界不规则。

Method: 将小型触觉机器人改装为协作控制的手术工具，使用超声和电磁导航识别肿瘤边界，当手术工具碰撞肿瘤边界时施加禁止区域虚拟夹具。

Result: 虚拟夹具引导改善了切除边缘，用户发现使用触觉反馈时任务更轻松、精神负担更小。

Conclusion: 虚拟夹具可在模拟乳房保留手术中帮助定位肿瘤边界，未来将进行更广泛的用户研究以验证结果并优化系统。

Abstract: Purpose: Delineating tumor boundaries during breast-conserving surgery is
challenging as tumors are often highly mobile, non-palpable, and have
irregularly shaped borders. To address these challenges, we introduce a
cooperative robotic guidance system that applies haptic feedback for tumor
localization. In this pilot study, we aim to assess if and how this system can
be successfully integrated into breast cancer care.
  Methods: A small haptic robot is retrofitted with an electrocautery blade to
operate as a cooperatively controlled surgical tool. Ultrasound and
electromagnetic navigation are used to identify the tumor boundaries and
position. A forbidden region virtual fixture is imposed when the surgical tool
collides with the tumor boundary. We conducted a study where users were asked
to resect tumors from breast simulants both with and without the haptic
guidance. We then assess the results of these simulated resections both
qualitatively and quantitatively.
  Results: Virtual fixture guidance is shown to improve resection margins. On
average, users find the task to be less mentally demanding, frustrating, and
effort intensive when haptic feedback is available. We also discovered some
unanticipated impacts on surgical workflow that will guide design adjustments
and training protocol moving forward.
  Conclusion: Our results suggest that virtual fixtures can help localize tumor
boundaries in simulated breast-conserving surgery. Future work will include an
extensive user study to further validate these results and fine-tune our
guidance system.

Conclusion: VL-KnG系统通过知识图谱方法有效解决了VLM在机器人导航中的关键限制，在保持高性能的同时提供可解释性和计算效率。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown potential for robot navigation but
encounter fundamental limitations: they lack persistent scene memory, offer
limited spatial reasoning, and do not scale effectively with video duration for
real-time application. We present VL-KnG, a Visual Scene Understanding system
that tackles these challenges using spatiotemporal knowledge graph construction
and computationally efficient query processing for navigation goal

structures. We also introduce WalkieKnowledge, a new benchmark with about 200
manually annotated questions across 8 diverse trajectories spanning
approximately 100 minutes of video data, enabling fair comparison between
structured approaches and general-purpose VLMs. Real-world deployment on a
differential drive robot demonstrates practical applicability, with our method
achieving 77.27% success rate and 76.92% answer accuracy, matching Gemini 2.5
Pro performance while providing explainable reasoning supported by the
knowledge graph, computational efficiency for real-time deployment across
different tasks, such as localization, navigation and planning. Code and

Motivation: 解决自由漂浮、欠驱动、最小感知的仿生多连杆机器人的位姿估计问题，这类平台由于关节无驱动、感知有限而面临状态估计挑战。

Method: 使用无迹卡尔曼滤波增强高斯过程残差学习来补偿非零均值、非高斯噪声，通过概念验证硬件实验和离线卡尔曼滤波分析进行验证。

Result: 实验表明机器人位姿可以可靠估计，且在多步态数据集上训练的滤波器与仅在前进步态数据集上训练的滤波器性能相当。

Conclusion: 步态输入空间存在重叠，可利用这一特性减少训练数据需求，同时增强滤波器在多种步态间的泛化能力。

Abstract: This work demonstrates pose (position and shape) estimation for a
free-floating, bioinspired multi-link robot with unactuated joints,
link-mounted thrusters for control, and a single gyroscope per link, resulting
in an underactuated, minimally sensed platform. Through a proof-of-concept
hardware experiment and offline Kalman filter analysis, we show that the
robot's pose can be reliably estimated. State estimation is performed using an
unscented Kalman filter augmented with Gaussian process residual learning to
compensate for non-zero-mean, non-Gaussian noise. We further show that a filter
trained on a multi-gait dataset (forward, backward, left, right, and turning)
performs comparably to one trained on a larger forward-gait-only dataset when
both are evaluated on the same forward-gait test trajectory. These results
reveal overlap in the gait input space, which can be exploited to reduce
training data requirements while enhancing the filter's generalizability across
multiple gaits.

Conclusion: 该方法克服了频谱偏差和神经场拟合困难，实现了成本地形的平滑精确表示，具有在线探索、建图和实际导航的潜力。

Abstract: Robot navigation in large, complex, and unknown indoor environments is a
challenging problem. The existing approaches, such as traditional
sampling-based methods, struggle with resolution control and scalability, while
imitation learning-based methods require a large amount of demonstration data.
Active Neural Time Fields (ANTFields) have recently emerged as a promising
solution by using local observations to learn cost-to-go functions without
relying on demonstrations. Despite their potential, these methods are hampered
by challenges such as spectral bias and catastrophic forgetting, which diminish
their effectiveness in complex scenarios. To address these issues, our approach
decomposes the planning problem into a hierarchical structure. At the high
level, a sparse graph captures the environment's global connectivity, while at
the low level, a planner based on neural fields navigates local obstacles by
solving the Eikonal PDE. This physics-informed strategy overcomes common
pitfalls like spectral bias and neural field fitting difficulties, resulting in
a smooth and precise representation of the cost landscape. We validate our
framework in large-scale environments, demonstrating its enhanced adaptability
and precision compared to previous methods, and highlighting its potential for
online exploration, mapping, and real-world navigation.

Abstract: This paper proposes a real-time multi-plane segmentation method based on
GPU-accelerated high-resolution 3D voxel mapping for legged robot locomotion.
Existing online planar mapping approaches struggle to balance accuracy and
computational efficiency: direct depth image segmentation from specific sensors
suffers from poor temporal integration, height map-based methods cannot
represent complex 3D structures like overhangs, and voxel-based plane
segmentation remains unexplored for real-time applications. To address these
limitations, we develop a novel framework that integrates vertex-based
connected component labeling with random sample consensus based plane detection
and convex hull, leveraging GPU parallel computing to rapidly extract planar
regions from point clouds accumulated in high-resolution 3D voxel maps.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves fast and
accurate 3D multi-plane segmentation at over 30 Hz update rate even at a
resolution of 0.01 m, enabling the detected planes to be utilized in real time
for locomotion tasks. Furthermore, we validate the effectiveness of our
approach through experiments in both simulated environments and physical legged
robot platforms, confirming robust locomotion performance when considering 3D
planar structures.

Abstract: Bimanual robot manipulators can achieve impressive dexterity, but typically
rely on two full six- or seven- degree-of-freedom arms so that paired grippers
can coordinate effectively. This traditional framework increases system
complexity while only exploiting a fraction of the overall workspace for
dexterous interaction. We introduce the MiniBEE (Miniature Bimanual
End-effector), a compact system in which two reduced-mobility arms (3+ DOF
each) are coupled into a kinematic chain that preserves full relative
positioning between grippers. To guide our design, we formulate a kinematic
dexterity metric that enlarges the dexterous workspace while keeping the
mechanism lightweight and wearable. The resulting system supports two
complementary modes: (i) wearable kinesthetic data collection with self-tracked
gripper poses, and (ii) deployment on a standard robot arm, extending dexterity
across its entire workspace. We present kinematic analysis and design
optimization methods for maximizing dexterous range, and demonstrate an
end-to-end pipeline in which wearable demonstrations train imitation learning
policies that perform robust, real-world bimanual manipulation.

Abstract: We present ActiveUMI, a framework for a data collection system that transfers
in-the-wild human demonstrations to robots capable of complex bimanual

introduce several key techniques, including immersive 3D model rendering, a

ActiveUMI's defining feature is its capture of active, egocentric perception.
By recording an operator's deliberate head movements via a head-mounted
display, our system learns the crucial link between visual attention and
manipulation. We evaluate ActiveUMI on six challenging bimanual tasks. Policies
trained exclusively on ActiveUMI data achieve an average success rate of 70\%
on in-distribution tasks and demonstrate strong generalization, retaining a
56\% success rate when tested on novel objects and in new environments. Our
results demonstrate that portable data collection systems, when coupled with
learned active perception, provide an effective and scalable pathway toward
creating generalizable and highly capable real-world robot policies.

Motivation: 现有机器人操作数据集主要提供地面真实轨迹，缺乏失败恢复数据；少数失败检测数据集仅提供文本解释，难以直接用于VLA模型。需要解决机器人遇到不可预测和突发失败时的推理和恢复问题。

Abstract: Recent advances in robotic manipulation have integrated low-level robotic
control into Vision-Language Models (VLMs), extending them into
Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models. Although state-of-the-art VLAs achieve
strong performance in downstream robotic applications, supported by large-scale
crowd-sourced robot training data, they still inevitably encounter failures
during execution. Enabling robots to reason about and recover from
unpredictable and abrupt failures remains a critical challenge. Existing
robotic manipulation datasets, collected in either simulation or the real
world, primarily provide only ground-truth trajectories, leaving robots unable
to recover once failures occur. Moreover, the few datasets that address failure
detection typically offer only textual explanations, which are difficult to
utilize directly in VLA models. To address this gap, we introduce FailSafe, a
novel failure generation and recovery system that automatically produces
diverse failure cases paired with executable recovery actions. FailSafe can be
seamlessly applied to any manipulation task in any simulator, enabling scalable
creation of failure-action data. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we fine-tune
LLaVa-OneVision-7B (LLaVa-OV-7B) to build FailSafe-VLM. Experimental results
show that FailSafe-VLM successfully helps robotic arm detect and recover from

*Seungwon Choi,Donggyu Park,Seo-Yeon Hwang,Tae-Wan Kim*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种在线学习测量可靠性的统计框架，通过多视角几何一致性作为自监督信号，动态评估视觉惯性里程计中传感器测量的可靠性，相比固定不确定性参数的方法，在EuRoC数据集上平均减少了24%的平移误差和42%的旋转误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法假设所有测量具有静态、均匀的不确定性，无法捕捉真实世界数据中动态变化的误差特性，限制了鲁棒视觉惯性里程计的性能。

Method: 利用多视角几何一致性作为自监督信号，从传感器数据和优化结果中在线学习测量可靠性评估，推断地标不确定性并在优化过程中自适应加权视觉测量。

Result: 在EuRoC数据集上的评估显示，相比固定不确定性参数的基线方法，平均平移误差减少约24%，旋转误差减少约42%，框架能够实时运行并展现更高的精度和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 提出的统计框架能够在线学习测量可靠性，显著提升了视觉惯性里程计的跟踪精度和鲁棒性，代码将公开以促进可复现性和进一步研究。

Abstract: A fundamental challenge in robust visual-inertial odometry (VIO) is to
dynamically assess the reliability of sensor measurements. This assessment is
crucial for properly weighting the contribution of each measurement to the
state estimate. Conventional methods often simplify this by assuming a static,
uniform uncertainty for all measurements. This heuristic, however, may be
limited in its ability to capture the dynamic error characteristics inherent in
real-world data. To improve this limitation, we present a statistical framework
that learns measurement reliability assessment online, directly from sensor
data and optimization results. Our approach leverages multi-view geometric
consistency as a form of self-supervision. This enables the system to infer
landmark uncertainty and adaptively weight visual measurements during
optimization. We evaluated our method on the public EuRoC dataset,
demonstrating improvements in tracking accuracy with average reductions of
approximately 24\% in translation error and 42\% in rotation error compared to
baseline methods with fixed uncertainty parameters. The resulting framework
operates in real time while showing enhanced accuracy and robustness. To
facilitate reproducibility and encourage further research, the source code will
be made publicly available.

TL;DR: SymSkill是一个统一的学习框架，结合了模仿学习和任务运动规划的优势，实现了组合泛化和实时故障恢复。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多步操作在动态环境中的挑战：模仿学习缺乏组合泛化能力，而任务运动规划存在规划延迟问题。

Method: 从无标签、无分割的演示中联合学习谓词、操作符和技能，使用符号规划器组合和重新排序技能，并在运动和符号层面进行实时恢复。

Result: 在RoboCasa模拟中执行12个单步任务成功率85%，无需额外数据即可组合成最多6次技能重组的复杂计划；在真实机器人上从5分钟无标签游戏数据学习后能执行多任务。

Conclusion: SymSkill框架实现了组合泛化和实时故障恢复，在模拟和真实机器人上都表现出色。

Abstract: Multi-step manipulation in dynamic environments remains challenging. Two
major families of methods fail in distinct ways: (i) imitation learning (IL) is
reactive but lacks compositional generalization, as monolithic policies do not
decide which skill to reuse when scenes change; (ii) classical task-and-motion
planning (TAMP) offers compositionality but has prohibitive planning latency,
preventing real-time failure recovery. We introduce SymSkill, a unified
learning framework that combines the benefits of IL and TAMP, allowing
compositional generalization and failure recovery in real-time. Offline,
SymSkill jointly learns predicates, operators, and skills directly from
unlabeled and unsegmented demonstrations. At execution time, upon specifying a
conjunction of one or more learned predicates, SymSkill uses a symbolic planner
to compose and reorder learned skills to achieve the symbolic goals, while
performing recovery at both the motion and symbolic levels in real time.
Coupled with a compliant controller, SymSkill enables safe and uninterrupted
execution under human and environmental disturbances. In RoboCasa simulation,
SymSkill can execute 12 single-step tasks with 85% success rate. Without
additional data, it composes these skills into multi-step plans requiring up to
6 skill recompositions, recovering robustly from execution failures. On a real
Franka robot, we demonstrate SymSkill, learning from 5 minutes of unsegmented
and unlabeled play data, is capable of performing multiple tasks simply by goal
specifications. The source code and additional analysis can be found on

TL;DR: 提出了一种考虑伺服和转子动力学的可变倾斜全向多旋翼几何反步控制器，相比不考虑执行器动态的基线方法，在快速平移跟踪、快速旋转跟踪和抗干扰恢复实验中表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有执行器感知控制方法依赖于执行器输入与力矩之间的线性关系，无法捕捉可变倾斜角引起的非线性效应，需要开发能处理这些非线性动态的控制器。

Method: 利用多旋翼刚体动力学与非线性执行器动力学之间的级联结构，设计几何反步控制器，并建立整个系统的指数稳定性。

Result: 在三个实验场景中，所提控制器始终获得更好的跟踪性能，在最快平移轨迹跟踪和恢复实验中，基线方法发散并坠毁，而所提控制器保持稳定并成功完成任务。

Conclusion: 所提出的控制器能有效处理执行器非线性动态，对参数不确定性具有鲁棒性，在激进飞行和抗干扰恢复中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: This work presents a geometric backstepping controller for a variable-tilt
omnidirectional multirotor that explicitly accounts for both servo and rotor
dynamics. Considering actuator dynamics is essential for more effective and
reliable operation, particularly during aggressive flight maneuvers or recovery
from sudden disturbances. While prior studies have investigated actuator-aware
control for conventional and fixed-tilt multirotors, these approaches rely on
linear relationships between actuator input and wrench, which cannot capture
the nonlinearities induced by variable tilt angles. In this work, we exploit
the cascade structure between the rigid-body dynamics of the multirotor and its
nonlinear actuator dynamics to design the proposed backstepping controller and
establish exponential stability of the overall system. Furthermore, we reveal
parametric uncertainty in the actuator model through experiments, and we
demonstrate that the proposed controller remains robust against such
uncertainty. The controller was compared against a baseline that does not
account for actuator dynamics across three experimental scenarios: fast
translational tracking, rapid rotational tracking, and recovery from sudden
disturbance. The proposed method consistently achieved better tracking
performance, and notably, while the baseline diverged and crashed during the
fastest translational trajectory tracking and the recovery experiment, the
proposed controller maintained stability and successfully completed the tasks,
thereby demonstrating its effectiveness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单个模拟器存在归纳偏差，导致跨模拟器和模拟到真实世界之间存在显著差异，影响策略的泛化能力。

Method: 开发PolySim平台，在单个训练运行中同时启动多个异构模拟器的并行环境，实现动态层面的领域随机化。

Result: 在模拟器间评估中显著降低运动跟踪误差，在MuJoCo上比IsaacSim基线提高52.8%的执行成功率，并实现零样本在真实Unitree G1机器人上的部署。

Conclusion: 多模拟器联合训练能有效减少模拟器归纳偏差，提高策略的泛化能力，实现从模拟到真实世界的有效迁移。

Abstract: Humanoid whole-body control (WBC) policies trained in simulation often suffer
from the sim-to-real gap, which fundamentally arises from simulator inductive
bias, the inherent assumptions and limitations of any single simulator. These
biases lead to nontrivial discrepancies both across simulators and between
simulation and the real world. To mitigate the effect of simulator inductive
bias, the key idea is to train policies jointly across multiple simulators,
encouraging the learned controller to capture dynamics that generalize beyond
any single simulator's assumptions. We thus introduce PolySim, a WBC training
platform that integrates multiple heterogeneous simulators. PolySim can launch
parallel environments from different engines simultaneously within a single
training run, thereby realizing dynamics-level domain randomization.
Theoretically, we show that PolySim yields a tighter upper bound on simulator
inductive bias than single-simulator training. In experiments, PolySim
substantially reduces motion-tracking error in sim-to-sim evaluations; for
example, on MuJoCo, it improves execution success by 52.8 over an IsaacSim
baseline. PolySim further enables zero-shot deployment on a real Unitree G1
without additional fine-tuning, showing effective transfer from simulation to
the real world. We will release the PolySim code upon acceptance of this work.

TL;DR: 提出Robot State-aware Contrastive Loss (RS-CL)，通过对比学习将VLA模型的表示与机器人本体感觉状态对齐，提升机器人操作性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的VLA模型表示对机器人信号（如控制动作和本体感觉状态）不够敏感，导致在机器人操作任务中表现欠佳。

Method: 引入RS-CL损失函数，利用机器人状态间的相对距离作为软监督，将VLA表示与机器人本体感觉状态对齐，同时保持与标准VLA训练流程兼容。

Result: 在RoboCasa-Kitchen拾放任务中，成功率从30.8%提升至41.5%；在真实机器人操作任务中，成功率从45.0%提升至58.3%。

Conclusion: RS-CL能有效增强VLA模型的控制相关表示学习，显著提升机器人操作性能，且方法轻量级易于集成。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown its capabilities in robot
manipulation by leveraging rich representations from pre-trained
Vision-Language Models (VLMs). However, their representations arguably remain
suboptimal, lacking sensitivity to robotic signals such as control actions and
proprioceptive states. To address the issue, we introduce Robot State-aware
Contrastive Loss (RS-CL), a simple and effective representation regularization
for VLA models, designed to bridge the gap between VLM representations and
robotic signals. In particular, RS-CL aligns the representations more closely
with the robot's proprioceptive states, by using relative distances between the
states as soft supervision. Complementing the original action prediction
objective, RS-CL effectively enhances control-relevant representation learning,
while being lightweight and fully compatible with standard VLA training
pipeline. Our empirical results demonstrate that RS-CL substantially improves
the manipulation performance of state-of-the-art VLA models; it pushes the
prior art from 30.8% to 41.5% on pick-and-place tasks in RoboCasa-Kitchen,
through more accurate positioning during grasping and placing, and boosts
success rates from 45.0% to 58.3% on challenging real-robot manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: 该紧凑、无缆平台结合了多功能变形与精确载荷递送，在下一代定点治疗中显示出强大潜力。

Abstract: Magnetic continuum robots (MCRs) enable minimally invasive navigation through
tortuous anatomical channels, yet axially magnetized designs have largely been
limited to bending-only motion. To expand deformation capabilities, this paper
presents a simple assembly that embeds permanent magnets radially within the
catheter wall, allowing a single externally steered permanent magnet to
independently induce either bending or torsion. A physics-based formulation
together with finite-element analysis establishes the actuation principles, and
benchtop experiments validate decoupled mode control under practical fields.
Building on this, a dual-layer blockage mechanism consisting of outer grooves
and inner plates leverages torsional shear to achieve on-demand drug release.
Finally, an in-phantom intervention experiment demonstrates end-to-end
operation: lumen following by bending for target approach, followed by
twist-activated release at the site. The resulting compact, cable-free platform
combines versatile deformation with precise payload delivery, indicating strong
potential for next-generation, site-specific therapies.

Method: 提出了TS-ACES（基于交通系统的随时循环嵌入求解器），这是一个完整的、高度可扩展的SFE解决方案。

Result: TS-ACES能够扩展到基于真实工业场景的SFE实例，处理超过一百台机器的情况。

Conclusion: TS-ACES填补了智能工厂嵌入问题的可扩展性空白，为现代自动化工厂提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Modern automated factories increasingly run manufacturing procedures using a
matrix of programmable machines, such as 3D printers, interconnected by a
programmable transport system, such as a fleet of tabletop robots. To embed a
manufacturing procedure into a smart factory, an operator must: (a) assign each
of its processes to a machine and (b) specify how agents should transport parts
between machines. The problem of embedding a manufacturing process into a smart
factory is termed the Smart Factory Embedding (SFE) problem. State-of-the-art
SFE solvers can only scale to factories containing a couple dozen machines.
Modern smart factories, however, may contain hundreds of machines. We fill this
hole by introducing the first highly scalable solution to the SFE, TS-ACES, the
Traffic System based Anytime Cyclic Embedding Solver. We show that TS-ACES is
complete and can scale to SFE instances based on real industrial scenarios with
more than a hundred machines.

Motivation: 视觉语言模型在自动驾驶中应用广泛，但高推理延迟阻碍实时部署。传统早期退出方法受限于任务依赖性，难以适应多样化场景。

Method: 基于导航系统可预测即将到来的场景（如交叉口、交通灯），Nav-EE离线预计算任务特定退出层，在线根据导航先验动态应用这些层。

Conclusion: 将导航预见性与早期退出相结合，为大型模型在自动驾驶系统中的高效部署提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly applied in autonomous driving
for unified perception and reasoning, but high inference latency hinders
real-time deployment. Early-exit reduces latency by terminating inference at
intermediate layers, yet its task-dependent nature limits generalization across
diverse scenarios. We observe that this limitation aligns with autonomous
driving: navigation systems can anticipate upcoming contexts (e.g.,
intersections, traffic lights), indicating which tasks will be required. We
propose Nav-EE, a navigation-guided early-exit framework that precomputes
task-specific exit layers offline and dynamically applies them online based on
navigation priors. Experiments on CODA, Waymo, and BOSCH show that Nav-EE
achieves accuracy comparable to full inference while reducing latency by up to
63.9%. Real-vehicle integration with Autoware Universe further demonstrates
reduced inference latency (600ms to 300ms), supporting faster decision-making
in complex scenarios. These results suggest that coupling navigation foresight
with early-exit offers a viable path toward efficient deployment of large
models in autonomous systems. Code and data are available at our anonymous

Method: 将模块化RL物体导航系统分解为感知、策略和测试时增强三个组件，通过大量受控实验隔离每个组件的贡献，分析性能驱动因素。

Result: 感知质量和测试时策略是性能的决定性驱动因素，而策略改进仅带来边际增益。基于洞察开发的增强模块化系统在SPL指标上超越现有最佳方法6.6%，成功率提高2.7%。人类专家在相同条件下达到98%成功率。

Conclusion: 感知和测试时增强是物体目标导航性能的关键驱动因素，而非策略改进。研究为未来物体导航系统的开发和评估提供了原则性指导，并建立了新的性能基准。

Abstract: Object-Goal Navigation (ObjectNav) is a critical component toward deploying
mobile robots in everyday, uncontrolled environments such as homes, schools,
and workplaces. In this context, a robot must locate target objects in
previously unseen environments using only its onboard perception. Success
requires the integration of semantic understanding, spatial reasoning, and
long-horizon planning, which is a combination that remains extremely
challenging. While reinforcement learning (RL) has become the dominant
paradigm, progress has spanned a wide range of design choices, yet the field
still lacks a unifying analysis to determine which components truly drive
performance. In this work, we conduct a large-scale empirical study of modular
RL-based ObjectNav systems, decomposing them into three key components:
perception, policy, and test-time enhancement. Through extensive controlled
experiments, we isolate the contribution of each and uncover clear trends:
perception quality and test-time strategies are decisive drivers of
performance, whereas policy improvements with current methods yield only
marginal gains. Building on these insights, we propose practical design
guidelines and demonstrate an enhanced modular system that surpasses
State-of-the-Art (SotA) methods by 6.6% on SPL and by a 2.7% success rate. We
also introduce a human baseline under identical conditions, where experts
achieve an average 98% success, underscoring the gap between RL agents and
human-level navigation. Our study not only sets the SotA performance but also
provides principled guidance for future ObjectNav development and evaluation.

Conclusion: 该方法在人形机器人足球踢球任务中表现出高效性和可靠性，为机器人踢球动作规划提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Humanoid robot soccer presents several challenges, particularly in
maintaining system stability during aggressive kicking motions while achieving
precise ball trajectory control. Current solutions, whether traditional
position-based control methods or reinforcement learning (RL) approaches,
exhibit significant limitations. Model predictive control (MPC) is a prevalent
approach for ordinary quadruped and biped robots. While MPC has demonstrated
advantages in legged robots, existing studies often oversimplify the leg swing
progress, relying merely on simple trajectory interpolation methods. This
severely constrains the foot's environmental interaction capability, hindering
tasks such as ball kicking. This study innovatively adapts the spatial-temporal
trajectory planning method, which has been successful in drone applications, to
bipedal robotic systems. The proposed approach autonomously generates foot
trajectories that satisfy constraints on target kicking position, velocity, and
acceleration while simultaneously optimizing swing phase duration. Experimental
results demonstrate that the optimized trajectories closely mimic human kicking
behavior, featuring a backswing motion. Simulation and hardware experiments
confirm the algorithm's efficiency, with trajectory planning times under 1 ms,
and its reliability, achieving nearly 100 % task completion accuracy when the
soccer goal is within the range of -90{\deg} to 90{\deg}.

Abstract: Simulating greenhouse environments is critical for developing and evaluating
robotic systems for agriculture, yet existing approaches rely on simplistic or
synthetic assets that limit simulation-to-real transfer. Recent advances in
radiance field methods, such as Gaussian splatting, enable photorealistic
reconstruction but have so far been restricted to individual plants or
controlled laboratory conditions. In this work, we introduce GreenhouseSplat, a
framework and dataset for generating photorealistic greenhouse assets directly
from inexpensive RGB images. The resulting assets are integrated into a
ROS-based simulation with support for camera and LiDAR rendering, enabling
tasks such as localization with fiducial markers. We provide a dataset of 82
cucumber plants across multiple row configurations and demonstrate its utility
for robotics evaluation. GreenhouseSplat represents the first step toward
greenhouse-scale radiance-field simulation and offers a foundation for future

Conclusion: TACOS提供了一个统一的框架，通过大语言模型实现多无人机系统的高级自然语言控制，有效减少了飞行员工作负担。

Abstract: When a single pilot is responsible for managing a multi-drone system, the
task demands varying levels of autonomy, from direct control of individual
UAVs, to group-level coordination, to fully autonomous swarm behaviors for
accomplishing high-level tasks. Enabling such flexible interaction requires a
framework that supports multiple modes of shared autonomy. As language models
continue to improve in reasoning and planning, they provide a natural
foundation for such systems, reducing pilot workload by enabling high-level
task delegation through intuitive, language-based interfaces. In this paper we
present TACOS (Task-Agnostic COordinator of a multi-drone System), a unified
framework that enables high-level natural language control of multi-UAV systems
through Large Language Models (LLMs). TACOS integrates three key capabilities
into a single architecture: a one-to-many natural language interface for
intuitive user interaction, an intelligent coordinator for translating user
intent into structured task plans, and an autonomous agent that executes plans
interacting with the real-world. TACOS allows a LLM to interact with a library
of executable APIs, bridging semantic reasoning with real-time multi-robot
coordination. We demonstrate the system in real-world multi-drone system and
conduct an ablation study to assess the contribution of each module.

Abstract: We present SPARC, a compact, open-source 3-DoF sagittal-plane spine module
that combines revolute (pitch) and prismatic (axial) motion with programmable
task-space impedance for quadruped robots. The system integrates three
torque-controlled actuators, a custom 1 kHz control board, and a protected
power unit in a 1.26 kg package, enabling closed-loop stiffness and damping
shaping along x, z, and theta. We develop an RNEA-based computed-acceleration
controller with smooth Stribeck friction compensation to render spring-damper
behavior without explicit inertia shaping. Bench experiments validate the
approach. Quasi-static push-pull tests show linear force-displacement
characteristics with commanded horizontal stiffness spanning 300-700 N/m and <=
1.5% relative error (R^2 >= 0.992, narrow 95% CIs). Dynamic
displace-and-release trials confirm mass-spring-damper responses over multiple
damping settings, with small, interpretable phase deviations due to
configuration-dependent inertia and low-speed friction effects. A task-space PD
controller produces roughly linear stiffness but with greater variability and
coupling sensitivity. SPARC provides a portable platform for systematic studies
of spine compliance in legged locomotion and will be released with complete
hardware and firmware resources.

unscaled veridical visuals. In this paper, a motion cueing algorithm is
proposed that reduces motion sickness as predicted by the subjective vertical
conflict (SVC) model using model predictive control (MPC). Both sensory
conflict and specific force errors are penalised in the cost function, allowing
the algorithm to jointly optimise fidelity and comfort.
  Human-in-the-loop experiments were conducted to compare four simulator motion
settings: two variations of our MPC-based algorithm, one focused on pure
specific force tracking and the second compromising specific force tracking and
motion sickness minimisation, as well as reference adaptive washout and no
motion cases. The experiments were performed on a hexapod driving simulator
with participants exposed to passive driving.
  Experimental motion sickness results closely matched the sickness model
predictions. As predicted by the model, the no motion condition yielded the
lowest sickness levels. However, it was rated lowest in terms of fidelity. The
compromise solution reduced sickness by over 50% (average MISC level 3 to 1.5)
compared to adaptive washout and the algorithm focusing on specific force
tracking, without any significant reduction in fidelity rating.
  The proposed approach for developing MCA that takes into account both the
simulator dynamics and time evolution of motion sickness offers a significant
advancement in achieving an optimal control of motion sickness and specific
force recreation in driving simulators, supporting broader simulator use.

TL;DR: EC3R-SLAM是一个无需相机标定的单目稠密SLAM框架，通过结合跟踪模块和基于前馈3D重建的映射模块，实现了高精度、低延迟和低GPU内存消耗，并在资源受限平台上有效运行。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统单目稠密SLAM存在高延迟、大GPU内存消耗和依赖相机标定的问题，限制了实际应用。

Method: 结合稀疏特征点图的跟踪模块和同时估计相机内参的前馈3D重建映射模块，并集成局部和全局闭环检测以确保数据关联和多视角一致性。

Result: 在多个基准测试中达到与最先进方法竞争的性能，同时速度更快、内存效率更高，能在笔记本电脑和Jetson Orin NX等资源受限平台上有效运行。

Conclusion: EC3R-SLAM框架在保持高精度的同时显著提升了效率和实用性，具有在真实世界机器人应用中推广的潜力。

Abstract: The application of monocular dense Simultaneous Localization and Mapping
(SLAM) is often hindered by high latency, large GPU memory consumption, and
reliance on camera calibration. To relax this constraint, we propose EC3R-SLAM,
a novel calibration-free monocular dense SLAM framework that jointly achieves
high localization and mapping accuracy, low latency, and low GPU memory
consumption. This enables the framework to achieve efficiency through the
coupling of a tracking module, which maintains a sparse map of feature points,
and a mapping module based on a feed-forward 3D reconstruction model that
simultaneously estimates camera intrinsics. In addition, both local and global
loop closures are incorporated to ensure mid-term and long-term data
association, enforcing multi-view consistency and thereby enhancing the overall
accuracy and robustness of the system. Experiments across multiple benchmarks
show that EC3R-SLAM achieves competitive performance compared to
state-of-the-art methods, while being faster and more memory-efficient.
Moreover, it runs effectively even on resource-constrained platforms such as
laptops and Jetson Orin NX, highlighting its potential for real-world robotics
applications.

Abstract: The existing language-driven grasping methods struggle to fully handle
ambiguous instructions containing implicit intents. To tackle this challenge,
we propose LangGrasp, a novel language-interactive robotic grasping framework.
The framework integrates fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) to leverage
their robust commonsense understanding and environmental perception
capabilities, thereby deducing implicit intents from linguistic instructions
and clarifying task requirements along with target manipulation objects.
Furthermore, our designed point cloud localization module, guided by 2D part
segmentation, enables partial point cloud localization in scenes, thereby
extending grasping operations from coarse-grained object-level to fine-grained
part-level manipulation. Experimental results show that the LangGrasp framework
accurately resolves implicit intents in ambiguous instructions, identifying
critical operations and target information that are unstated yet essential for
task completion. Additionally, it dynamically selects optimal grasping poses by
integrating environmental information. This enables high-precision grasping
from object-level to part-level manipulation, significantly enhancing the
adaptability and task execution efficiency of robots in unstructured
environments. More information and code are available here:

Abstract: Stand-up motions are an indispensable part of humanoid robot soccer. A robot
incapable of standing up by itself is removed from the game for some time. In
this paper, we present our stand-up motions for the NAO robot. Our approach
dates back to 2019 and has been evaluated and slightly expanded over the past
six years. We claim that the main reason for failed stand-up attempts are large
errors in the executed joint positions. By addressing such problems by either
executing special motions to free up stuck limbs such as the arms, or by
compensating large errors with other joints, we significantly increased the
overall success rate of our stand-up routine. The motions presented in this
paper are also used by several other teams in the Standard Platform League,
which thereby achieve similar success rates, as shown in an analysis of videos
from multiple tournaments.

Abstract: We introduce the soft curvature and spectroscopy (SCANS) system: a versatile,
electronics-free, fluidically actuated soft manipulator capable of assessing
the spectral properties of objects either in hand or through pre-touch caging.
This platform offers a wider spectral sensing capability than previous soft
robotic counterparts. We perform a material analysis to explore optimal soft
substrates for spectral sensing, and evaluate both pre-touch and in-hand
performance. Experiments demonstrate explainable, statistical separation across
diverse object classes and sizes (metal, wood, plastic, organic, paper, foam),
with large spectral angle differences between items. Through linear
discriminant analysis, we show that sensitivity in the near-infrared
wavelengths is critical to distinguishing visually similar objects. These
capabilities advance the potential of optics as a multi-functional sensory
modality for soft robots. The complete parts list, assembly guidelines, and

Motivation: 在循环经济背景下，制造商往往不共享相关数据，导致产品生命周期结束阶段的再制造和回收过程得不到充分支持，影响可持续性和环境保护。

Method: 采用数字孪生技术，基于产品-过程-资源资产网络（PAN）范式，提出双向PAN（Bi-PAN）表示方法，能够同时建模制造和再制造/回收阶段的相关关系。

Conclusion: 数字孪生技术和Bi-PAN表示方法能够优化拆解过程，减少生态影响，增强可持续性，为循环经济提供技术支持。

Abstract: In the context of the circular economy, products in their end-of-life phase
should be either remanufactured or recycled. Both of these processes are
crucial for sustainability and environmental conservation. However,
manufacturers often do not support these processes enough by not sharing
relevant data. This paper proposes use of a digital twin technology, which is
capable to help optimizing the disassembly processes to reduce ecological
impact and enhance sustainability. The proposed approach is demonstrated
through a disassembly use-case of the product digital twin of an electric
vehicle battery. By utilizing product digital twins, challenges associated with
the disassembly of electric vehicle batteries can be solved flexibly and
efficiently for various battery types. As a backbone for the product digital
twin representation, the paper uses the paradigm of product-process-resource
asset networks (PAN). Such networks enable to model relevant relationships
across products, production resources, manufacturing processes, and specific
production operations that have to be done in the manufacturing phase of a
product. This paper introduces a Bi-Flow Product-Process-Resource Asset Network
(Bi-PAN) representation, which extends the PAN paradigm to cover not only the
manufacturing, but also the remanufacturing/recycling phase.

Motivation: 传统方法因固定数据集而泛化能力差，现有LLM和VLM方法虽然语义丰富但缺乏鲁棒和灵活的精炼机制，导致布局不理想。

Method: 开发DisCo-Layout框架，包含语义精炼工具(SRT)修正抽象对象关系，物理精炼工具(PRT)通过网格匹配算法解决具体空间问题，以及多智能体框架协调这些工具。

Conclusion: DisCo-Layout通过解耦和协调物理与语义精炼，有效解决了3D室内布局合成中的泛化和精炼问题。

Abstract: 3D indoor layout synthesis is crucial for creating virtual environments.
Traditional methods struggle with generalization due to fixed datasets. While
recent LLM and VLM-based approaches offer improved semantic richness, they
often lack robust and flexible refinement, resulting in suboptimal layouts. We
develop DisCo-Layout, a novel framework that disentangles and coordinates
physical and semantic refinement. For independent refinement, our Semantic
Refinement Tool (SRT) corrects abstract object relationships, while the
Physical Refinement Tool (PRT) resolves concrete spatial issues via a
grid-matching algorithm. For collaborative refinement, a multi-agent framework
intelligently orchestrates these tools, featuring a planner for placement
rules, a designer for initial layouts, and an evaluator for assessment.
Experiments demonstrate DisCo-Layout's state-of-the-art performance, generating
realistic, coherent, and generalizable 3D indoor layouts. Our code will be
publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉策略在航迹几何变化时性能下降，存在过拟合问题，需要提高视觉策略的泛化能力和鲁棒性。

Method: 基于高斯溅射(GSplat)构建FalconGym 2.0仿真框架，提供编辑API快速生成多样化静态和动态航迹；提出性能引导精炼(PGR)算法，在挑战性航迹上集中训练视觉策略。

Result: 在固定翼无人机和四旋翼两个案例中，PGR训练的单一视觉策略在三个未见航迹上实现100%成功率，无需逐航迹重新训练；在门姿态扰动下保持更高成功率；零样本迁移到真实四旋翼硬件上，在70个门中成功通过69个(98.6%成功率)。

Conclusion: FalconGym 2.0结合PGR算法能有效训练具有强泛化性和鲁棒性的视觉策略，实现从仿真到现实的零样本迁移。

Abstract: Visual policy design is crucial for aerial navigation. However,
state-of-the-art visual policies often overfit to a single track and their
performance degrades when track geometry changes. We develop FalconGym 2.0, a
photorealistic simulation framework built on Gaussian Splatting (GSplat) with
an Edit API that programmatically generates diverse static and dynamic tracks
in milliseconds. Leveraging FalconGym 2.0's editability, we propose a
Performance-Guided Refinement (PGR) algorithm, which concentrates visual
policy's training on challenging tracks while iteratively improving its
performance. Across two case studies (fixed-wing UAVs and quadrotors) with
distinct dynamics and environments, we show that a single visual policy trained
with PGR in FalconGym 2.0 outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in
generalization and robustness: it generalizes to three unseen tracks with 100%
success without per-track retraining and maintains higher success rates under
gate-pose perturbations. Finally, we demonstrate that the visual policy trained
with PGR in FalconGym 2.0 can be zero-shot sim-to-real transferred to a
quadrotor hardware, achieving a 98.6% success rate (69 / 70 gates) over 30
trials spanning two three-gate tracks and a moving-gate track.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人形运动跟踪策略面临人体与机器人之间的具身差距挑战，现有方法在重定向过程中引入的伪影会降低策略鲁棒性，需要大量奖励工程来纠正。

Method: 提出通用运动重定向(GMR)方法，与PHC、ProtoMotions等开源重定向器以及Unitree闭源数据集进行对比评估，使用BeyondMimic进行策略训练以隔离重定向效果。

Result: 实验表明，虽然大多数运动可以被跟踪，但重定向数据中的伪影显著降低策略鲁棒性，特别是在动态或长序列中。GMR在跟踪性能和运动保真度方面始终优于现有开源方法。

Conclusion: GMR实现了接近闭源基线的感知保真度和策略成功率，证明了高质量重定向对提升人形运动跟踪策略性能的重要性。

Abstract: Humanoid motion tracking policies are central to building teleoperation
pipelines and hierarchical controllers, yet they face a fundamental challenge:
the embodiment gap between humans and humanoid robots. Current approaches
address this gap by retargeting human motion data to humanoid embodiments and
then training reinforcement learning (RL) policies to imitate these reference
trajectories. However, artifacts introduced during retargeting, such as foot
sliding, self-penetration, and physically infeasible motion are often left in
the reference trajectories for the RL policy to correct. While prior work has
demonstrated motion tracking abilities, they often require extensive reward
engineering and domain randomization to succeed. In this paper, we
systematically evaluate how retargeting quality affects policy performance when
excessive reward tuning is suppressed. To address issues that we identify with
existing retargeting methods, we propose a new retargeting method, General
Motion Retargeting (GMR). We evaluate GMR alongside two open-source
retargeters, PHC and ProtoMotions, as well as with a high-quality closed-source
dataset from Unitree. Using BeyondMimic for policy training, we isolate
retargeting effects without reward tuning. Our experiments on a diverse subset
of the LAFAN1 dataset reveal that while most motions can be tracked, artifacts
in retargeted data significantly reduce policy robustness, particularly for
dynamic or long sequences. GMR consistently outperforms existing open-source
methods in both tracking performance and faithfulness to the source motion,
achieving perceptual fidelity and policy success rates close to the
closed-source baseline. Website:

TL;DR: 该论文研究通过显式地将策略与相机外参条件化来实现视角不变的模仿学习，使用Plucker嵌入表示像素射线，在RoboSuite和ManiSkill中引入六个操作任务来评估策略在视角变化下的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模仿学习策略在固定场景中可能通过静态背景的视觉线索推断相机姿态，但当工作空间几何或相机位置发生变化时，这种捷径会失效，导致性能下降。

Method: 使用Plucker嵌入表示像素射线，将相机外参显式地条件化到策略中，包括ACT、Diffusion Policy和SmolVLA等标准行为克隆策略。

Result: 实验表明，条件化相机外参显著提高了策略在不同视角下的泛化能力，恢复了性能，并实现了无需深度的鲁棒RGB控制。

Conclusion: 显式条件化相机外参是实现视角不变模仿学习的有效方法，能够提高策略在真实视角变化下的鲁棒性。

Abstract: We study view-invariant imitation learning by explicitly conditioning
policies on camera extrinsics. Using Plucker embeddings of per-pixel rays, we
show that conditioning on extrinsics significantly improves generalization
across viewpoints for standard behavior cloning policies, including ACT,
Diffusion Policy, and SmolVLA. To evaluate policy robustness under realistic
viewpoint shifts, we introduce six manipulation tasks in RoboSuite and
ManiSkill that pair "fixed" and "randomized" scene variants, decoupling
background cues from camera pose. Our analysis reveals that policies without
extrinsics often infer camera pose using visual cues from static backgrounds in
fixed scenes; this shortcut collapses when workspace geometry or camera
placement shifts. Conditioning on extrinsics restores performance and yields
robust RGB-only control without depth. We release the tasks, demonstrations,
and code at https://ripl.github.io/know_your_camera/ .

Motivation: 模仿学习在大规模真实世界数据中表现良好，但预训练策略在缺乏领域内数据时性能较差。人工收集演示数据成本高且质量不一，现有的人机协作系统需要全程人工监控，效率低下。

Method: 开发ARMADA系统，采用人机协作共享控制，结合FLOAT自主在线故障检测方法，实现并行策略部署，仅在必要时请求人工干预。

Conclusion: ARMADA系统通过高效的故障检测和选择性人工干预，显著提升了机器人部署的效率和适应性，为模仿学习在真实场景中的应用提供了更可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Imitation learning has shown promise in learning from large-scale real-world
datasets. However, pretrained policies usually perform poorly without
sufficient in-domain data. Besides, human-collected demonstrations entail
substantial labour and tend to encompass mixed-quality data and redundant
information. As a workaround, human-in-the-loop systems gather domain-specific
data for policy post-training, and exploit closed-loop policy feedback to offer
informative guidance, but usually require full-time human surveillance during
policy rollout. In this work, we devise ARMADA, a multi-robot deployment and
adaptation system with human-in-the-loop shared control, featuring an
autonomous online failure detection method named FLOAT. Thanks to FLOAT, ARMADA
enables paralleled policy rollout and requests human intervention only when
necessary, significantly reducing reliance on human supervision. Hence, ARMADA
enables efficient acquisition of in-domain data, and leads to more scalable
deployment and faster adaptation to new scenarios. We evaluate the performance
of ARMADA on four real-world tasks. FLOAT achieves nearly 95% accuracy on
average, surpassing prior state-of-the-art failure detection approaches by over
20%. Besides, ARMADA manifests more than 4$\times$ increase in success rate and
greater than 2$\times$ reduction in human intervention rate over multiple
rounds of policy rollout and post-training, compared to previous
human-in-the-loop learning methods.

Abstract: Efficient molecular dynamics (MD) simulation is vital for understanding
atomic-scale processes in materials science and biophysics. Traditional density
functional theory (DFT) methods are computationally expensive, which limits the
feasibility of long-term simulations. We propose a novel approach that
formulates MD simulation as a time-series forecasting problem, enabling
advanced forecasting models to predict atomic trajectories via displacements
rather than absolute positions. We incorporate a physics-informed loss and
inference mechanism based on DFT-parametrised pair-wise Morse potential
functions that penalize unphysical atomic proximity to enforce physical
plausibility. Our method consistently surpasses standard baselines in
simulation accuracy across diverse materials. The results highlight the
importance of incorporating physics knowledge to enhance the reliability and
precision of atomic trajectory forecasting. Remarkably, it enables stable
modeling of thousands of MD steps in minutes, offering a scalable alternative
to costly DFT simulations.

Result: 在数学推理任务上的实验表明，选择性采样即使在高温设置下也能改善质量-多样性的权衡。

Conclusion: 选择性采样方法有效解决了高温采样在精度敏感任务中的准确性下降问题，实现了更好的多样性和准确性平衡。

Abstract: Diversity is an essential metric for evaluating the creativity of outputs
generated by language models. Temperature-based sampling is a common strategy
to increase diversity. However, for tasks that require high precision, e.g.,
mathematical reasoning, uncontrolled high temperature sampling, e.g., min-$p$
or top-$p$, degrades reasoning quality. We demonstrate that the loss of
accuracy is caused by sampling incorrect continuations in sensitive decoding
positions. To address this, in this paper, we propose \textbf{selective
sampling}, a method that dynamically switches between greedy and
high-temperature sampling based on a sampling risk metric. This risk metric
estimates the likelihood of output errors when applying high-temperature
sampling on the current token position. To predict sampling risk, we train a
lightweight classifier on a small subset of verifiable problems. The trained
classifier can be integrated with the base language model with minimal latency
overhead. Experiments on mathematical reasoning tasks demonstrate that
selective sampling enhances the quality-diversity trade-off, even in
high-temperature settings.

Result: 从50篇人工整理论文的基准测试显示GPT-4.1达到最高准确率（热电特性F1=0.91，结构字段F1=0.82），整理了27,822条温度解析特性记录，包含ZT值、塞贝克系数、电导率等热电特性和晶体结构属性。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了迄今为止最大的LLM整理热电数据集，建立了可扩展的数据驱动材料发现基础，并发布了具有语义过滤器和数值查询功能的交互式网络浏览器。

Abstract: The rapid discovery of materials is constrained by the lack of large,
machine-readable datasets that couple performance metrics with structural
context. Existing databases are either small, manually curated, or biased
toward first principles results, leaving experimental literature
underexploited. We present an agentic, large language model (LLM)-driven
workflow that autonomously extracts thermoelectric and structural-properties
from about 10,000 full-text scientific articles. The pipeline integrates
dynamic token allocation, zeroshot multi-agent extraction, and conditional
table parsing to balance accuracy against computational cost. Benchmarking on
50 curated papers shows that GPT-4.1 achieves the highest accuracy (F1 = 0.91
for thermoelectric properties and 0.82 for structural fields), while GPT-4.1
Mini delivers nearly comparable performance (F1 = 0.89 and 0.81) at a fraction
of the cost, enabling practical large scale deployment. Applying this workflow,
we curated 27,822 temperature resolved property records with normalized units,
spanning figure of merit (ZT), Seebeck coefficient, conductivity, resistivity,
power factor, and thermal conductivity, together with structural attributes
such as crystal class, space group, and doping strategy. Dataset analysis
reproduces known thermoelectric trends, such as the superior performance of
alloys over oxides and the advantage of p-type doping, while also surfacing
broader structure-property correlations. To facilitate community access, we
release an interactive web explorer with semantic filters, numeric queries, and
CSV export. This study delivers the largest LLM-curated thermoelectric dataset
to date, provides a reproducible and cost-profiled extraction pipeline, and
establishes a foundation for scalable, data-driven materials discovery beyond
thermoelectrics.

*Zukang Xu,Xing Hu,Qiang Wu,Dawei Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RSAVQ是一个新颖的向量量化框架，通过几何驱动的创新方法解决LLM极低比特量化中的方向误差和比特分配问题，在2-4比特量化中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型参数指数增长给资源受限设备部署带来挑战，现有向量量化方法存在无约束方向误差和次优比特分配两个关键问题。

Method: 提出RSAVQ框架，包含两个创新：1)误差方向敏感度引导(EDSG)，利用Fisher信息矩阵诱导的黎曼度量将量化误差投影到参数空间低敏感方向；2)权重通道敏感度引导(WCSG)，通过FIM曲率分析构建通道级敏感度度量来动态指导比特资源分配。

Result: 实验表明RSAVQ在LLM量化中优于现有方法，在LLaMA-3 8B的2比特量化中，困惑度比VPTQ和QuIP#提升0.4，零样本准确率提升1.5。

Conclusion: 该工作为受限环境提供了实用解决方案，并在信息几何与神经网络量化之间建立了理论桥梁，推动了高效深度学习发展。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across
a wide range of natural language processing tasks. However, their exponentially
increasing parameters pose significant challenges for deployment on
resource-constrained devices. Vector Quantization (VQ) shows great promise for
low-bit quantization (e.g., 2 to 4 bits), but existing work faces two key
challenges: unconstrained direction error and suboptimal bit allocation. In
this paper, we propose RSAVQ, a novel VQ framework to enhance extremely low-bit
quantization for LLMs. RSAVQ introduces two geometry-driven innovations that
effectively mitigate above limitations: (1) Error Direction Sensitivity
Guidance (EDSG), which leverages the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM)-induced
Riemannian metric to project quantization errors onto low-sensitivity
directions in the parameter space. Specifically, this projection is performed
along the negative natural gradient direction, which effectively suppresses
error expansion. (2) Weight Channel Sensitivity Guidance (WCSG) , which
constructs a channel-wise sensitivity metric via FIM curvature analysis to
dynamically guide bit resource allocation. The approach facilitates a globally
optimal quantization solution within prescribed bit constraints. Experiments
demonstrate that RSAVQ outperforms existing methods for LLMs. For example, in
2-bit quantization of LLaMA-3 8B, RSAVQ leads baselines like VPTQ and QuIP# by
0.4 in perplexity (PPL) and 1.5 in zero-shot accuracy. This work offers a
practical solution for constrained environments and a theoretical bridge
between information geometry and the quantization of neural networks, advancing
efficient deep learning.

*Vedant Palit*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于信任感知深度Q网络的联邦学习防御方法，通过多信号证据集成和序列决策来抵御投毒和后门攻击，在CIFAR-10数据集上验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习在部分可观测性下容易受到投毒和后门攻击，需要设计有效的防御机制来保护模型安全。

Method: 将防御建模为部分可观测序列决策问题，引入信任感知深度Q网络，集成多信号证据进行客户端信任更新，同时优化长期鲁棒性-准确性目标。

Result: 在CIFAR-10上：(1)建立准确率稳步提升的基线；(2)Dirichlet扫描显示增加客户端重叠持续提高准确率并降低ASR，检测稳定；(3)信号预算研究表明准确率保持稳定，ASR增加，ROC-AUC下降，序列信念更新缓解弱信号；(4)与随机、线性Q和策略梯度控制器比较，DQN实现最佳鲁棒性-准确性权衡。

Conclusion: 信任感知深度Q网络能够有效防御联邦学习中的投毒和后门攻击，通过序列信念更新和多信号集成实现良好的鲁棒性-准确性平衡。

Abstract: Federated learning is vulnerable to poisoning and backdoor attacks under
partial observability. We formulate defence as a partially observable
sequential decision problem and introduce a trust-aware Deep Q-Network that
integrates multi-signal evidence into client trust updates while optimizing a
long-horizon robustness--accuracy objective. On CIFAR-10, we (i) establish a
baseline showing steadily improving accuracy, (ii) show through a Dirichlet
sweep that increased client overlap consistently improves accuracy and reduces
ASR with stable detection, and (iii) demonstrate in a signal-budget study that
accuracy remains steady while ASR increases and ROC-AUC declines as
observability is reduced, which highlights that sequential belief updates
mitigate weaker signals. Finally, a comparison with random, linear-Q, and
policy gradient controllers confirms that DQN achieves the best
robustness--accuracy trade-off.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确的列车延误预测对铁路运营效率至关重要，现有方法主要关注单个列车的精确延误预测，需要支持更高级别交通管理的车站级延误预测方法。

Method: 设计铁路中心化时空图卷积网络(RSTGCN)，包含列车频率感知的空间注意力机制和新型特征集成，用于预测特定时间段内所有进站列车的平均到达延误。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of train delays is critical for efficient railway
operations, enabling better scheduling and dispatching decisions. While earlier
approaches have largely focused on forecasting the exact delays of individual
trains, recent studies have begun exploring station-level delay prediction to
support higher-level traffic management. In this paper, we propose the
Railway-centric Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (RSTGCN), designed
to forecast average arrival delays of all the incoming trains at railway
stations for a particular time period. Our approach incorporates several
architectural innovations and novel feature integrations, including train
frequency-aware spatial attention, which significantly enhances predictive
performance. To support this effort, we curate and release a comprehensive
dataset for the entire Indian Railway Network (IRN), spanning 4,735 stations
across 17 zones - the largest and most diverse railway network studied to date.
We conduct extensive experiments using multiple state-of-the-art baselines,
demonstrating consistent improvements across standard metrics. Our work not
only advances the modeling of average delay prediction in large-scale rail
networks but also provides an open dataset to encourage further research in
this critical domain.

### [125] [Budgeted Broadcast: An Activity-Dependent Pruning Rule for Neural Network Efficiency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01263)
*Yaron Meirovitch,Fuming Yang,Jeff Lichtman,Nir Shavit*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Budgeted Broadcast (BB)剪枝方法，通过局部流量预算（激活率×扇出）来平衡选择性和传播范围，使用简单的局部执行器进行剪枝，在多种网络架构中提高编码熵和去相关性，有时甚至超过密集基线的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大多数剪枝方法基于损失影响（如幅度或梯度）来移除参数，但本文提出通过局部流量预算来优化网络表示，旨在学习更多样化和高效的表示。

Method: BB方法为每个单元分配局部流量预算（激活率×扇出），通过约束熵分析推导出选择性-受众平衡公式，使用局部执行器剪枝扇入（降低活动性）或扇出（减少传播）。

Result: 在ASR的Transformers、人脸识别的ResNets和突触预测的3D U-Nets中，BB在相同稀疏度下提高了编码熵、去相关性和准确率，在电子显微镜图像上达到最先进的F1和PR-AUC。

Conclusion: BB方法易于集成，为学习更多样化和高效的表示提供了一条路径，在多种任务和网络架构中表现出色。

Abstract: Most pruning methods remove parameters ranked by impact on loss (e.g.,
magnitude or gradient). We propose Budgeted Broadcast (BB), which gives each
unit a local traffic budget (the product of its long-term on-rate $a_i$ and
fan-out $k_i$). A constrained-entropy analysis shows that maximizing coding
entropy under a global traffic budget yields a selectivity-audience balance,
$\log\frac{1-a_i}{a_i}=\beta k_i$. BB enforces this balance with simple local
actuators that prune either fan-in (to lower activity) or fan-out (to reduce
broadcast). In practice, BB increases coding entropy and decorrelation and
improves accuracy at matched sparsity across Transformers for ASR, ResNets for
face identification, and 3D U-Nets for synapse prediction, sometimes exceeding
dense baselines. On electron microscopy images, it attains state-of-the-art F1
and PR-AUC under our evaluation protocol. BB is easy to integrate and suggests
a path toward learning more diverse and efficient representations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然现有MARL研究主要关注协作场景，但对抗性交互在现实应用（如追逃、安全、竞争性操作）中同样重要，需要支持异构智能体间的非对称目标和能力。

Abstract: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) is central to robotic systems
cooperating in dynamic environments. While prior work has focused on these
collaborative settings, adversarial interactions are equally critical for
real-world applications such as pursuit-evasion, security, and competitive
manipulation. In this work, we extend the IsaacLab framework to support
scalable training of adversarial policies in high-fidelity physics simulations.
We introduce a suite of adversarial MARL environments featuring heterogeneous
agents with asymmetric goals and capabilities. Our platform integrates a
competitive variant of Heterogeneous Agent Reinforcement Learning with Proximal
Policy Optimization (HAPPO), enabling efficient training and evaluation under
adversarial dynamics. Experiments across several benchmark scenarios
demonstrate the framework's ability to model and train robust policies for
morphologically diverse multi-agent competition while maintaining high
throughput and simulation realism. Code and benchmarks are available at:

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RLP是一种在预训练阶段引入强化学习思想的创新方法，通过将思维链视为探索性动作，基于信息增益计算奖励，鼓励模型在预测前独立思考，显著提升推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统训练范式只在最后阶段引入强化学习，作者质疑这是否是最优方式，希望将强化学习的探索精神更早地融入预训练过程。

Method: 提出RLP目标函数，将思维链作为探索动作，奖励信号基于思维链带来的信息增益（下一个token对数似然的提升），实现无验证器的密集奖励训练。

Result: 在Qwen3-1.7B-Base上，RLP预训练使8个数学科学基准平均提升19%；在Nemotron-Nano-12B-v2上，整体平均从42.81%提升至61.32%，科学推理提升23%。

Conclusion: RLP成功将强化学习重新定义为预训练目标，弥合了下一个token预测与有用思维链推理之间的差距，在不同架构和模型规模上均表现出良好的可扩展性。

Abstract: The dominant paradigm for training large reasoning models starts with
pre-training using next-token prediction loss on vast amounts of data.
Reinforcement learning, while powerful in scaling reasoning, is introduced only
as the very last phase of post-training, preceded by supervised fine-tuning.
While dominant, is this an optimal way of training? In this paper, we present
RLP, an information-driven reinforcement pretraining objective, that brings the
core spirit of reinforcement learning -- exploration -- to the last phase of
pretraining. The key idea is to treat chain-of-thought as an exploratory
action, with rewards computed based on the information gain it provides for
predicting future tokens. This training objective essentially encourages the
model to think for itself before predicting what comes next, thus teaching an
independent thinking behavior earlier in the pretraining. More concretely, the
reward signal measures the increase in log-likelihood of the next token when
conditioning on both context and a sampled reasoning chain, compared to
conditioning on context alone. This approach yields a verifier-free dense
reward signal, allowing for efficient training for the full document stream
during pretraining. Specifically, RLP reframes reinforcement learning for
reasoning as a pretraining objective on ordinary text, bridging the gap between
next-token prediction and the emergence of useful chain-of-thought reasoning.
Pretraining with RLP on Qwen3-1.7B-Base lifts the overall average across an
eight-benchmark math-and-science suite by 19%. With identical post-training,
the gains compound, with the largest improvements on reasoning-heavy tasks such
as AIME25 and MMLU-Pro. Applying RLP to the hybrid Nemotron-Nano-12B-v2
increases the overall average from 42.81% to 61.32% and raises the average on
scientific reasoning by 23%, demonstrating scalability across architectures and
model sizes.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合LQR和强化学习的混合控制框架，用于结构振动控制，避免了对精确系统模型的依赖，同时降低了RL训练过程中的风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于模型的振动控制方法需要繁琐的系统辨识，而纯RL方法在训练阶段可能对结构造成损害。研究发现即使基于错误模型的LQR控制器也比无控制效果好，因此提出混合框架。

Method: 结合LQR和RL控制器的混合框架，LQR策略从随机选择的模型和参数中推导，不依赖真实或近似结构模型，整体框架保持无模型特性。

Result: 该混合方法消除了对显式系统模型的依赖，同时最小化了朴素RL实现中的探索风险。

Conclusion: 这是首个解决RL振动控制关键训练安全挑战并提供验证解决方案的研究。

Abstract: Structural vibrations induced by external excitations pose significant risks,
including safety hazards for occupants, structural damage, and increased
maintenance costs. While conventional model-based control strategies, such as
Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR), effectively mitigate vibrations, their
reliance on accurate system models necessitates tedious system identification.
This tedious system identification process can be avoided by using a model-free
Reinforcement learning (RL) method. RL controllers derive their policies solely
from observed structural behaviour, eliminating the requirement for an explicit
structural model. For an RL controller to be truly model-free, its training
must occur on the actual physical system rather than in simulation. However,
during this training phase, the RL controller lacks prior knowledge and it
exerts control force on the structure randomly, which can potentially harm the
structure. To mitigate this risk, we propose guiding the RL controller using a
Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) controller. While LQR control typically relies
on an accurate structural model for optimal performance, our observations
indicate that even an LQR controller based on an entirely incorrect model
outperforms the uncontrolled scenario. Motivated by this finding, we introduce
a hybrid control framework that integrates both LQR and RL controllers. In this
approach, the LQR policy is derived from a randomly selected model and its
parameters. As this LQR policy does not require knowledge of the true or an
approximate structural model the overall framework remains model-free. This
hybrid approach eliminates dependency on explicit system models while
minimizing exploration risks inherent in naive RL implementations. As per our
knowledge, this is the first study to address the critical training safety
challenge of RL-based vibration control and provide a validated solution.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解RNN内部动态对于提高其可解释性和改进设计至关重要，但现有方法在识别关键信息传输节点方面存在不足。

Method: 使用互信息量化输入和输出向量之间的信息传输，识别信息中继节点，并在合成和真实时间序列分类任务中应用，包括LSTM和GRU等架构，同时进行节点敲除实验。

Result: 揭示了不同架构中信息中继的独特模式，展示了信息如何随时间处理和保持，节点敲除实验证实了识别节点的重要性。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅加深了对RNN复杂机制的理解，还为设计更鲁棒和可解释的神经网络提供了有价值的工具。

Abstract: Understanding the internal dynamics of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) is
crucial for advancing their interpretability and improving their design. This
study introduces an innovative information-theoretic method to identify and
analyze information-transfer nodes within RNNs, which we refer to as
\textit{information relays}. By quantifying the mutual information between
input and output vectors across nodes, our approach pinpoints critical pathways
through which information flows during network operations. We apply this
methodology to both synthetic and real-world time series classification tasks,
employing various RNN architectures, including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
networks and Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs). Our results reveal distinct patterns
of information relay across different architectures, offering insights into how
information is processed and maintained over time. Additionally, we conduct
node knockout experiments to assess the functional importance of identified
nodes, significantly contributing to explainable artificial intelligence by
elucidating how specific nodes influence overall network behavior. This study
not only enhances our understanding of the complex mechanisms driving RNNs but
also provides a valuable tool for designing more robust and interpretable
neural networks.

TL;DR: 提出NcPU框架，通过非对比学习解决PU学习中监督不可靠的问题，无需辅助信息即可在复杂数据集上显著提升性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决PU学习在复杂数据集上性能远低于监督学习的问题（如CIFAR-100上14.26%差距），主要瓶颈是在不可靠监督下学习判别性表征的挑战

Method: 结合噪声对鲁棒的非对比损失NoiSNCL（在不可靠监督下对齐类内表征）和幻影标签消歧PLD（通过基于遗憾的标签更新提供保守负监督）

Result: NoiSNCL使简单PU方法达到竞争性性能；NcPU在多样化数据集上显著优于最先进PU方法，包括灾后建筑损伤测绘等实际应用

Conclusion: NcPU框架通过非对比学习和标签消歧的协同作用，有效解决了PU学习中的表征学习瓶颈，在复杂数据集和实际应用中表现出强大潜力

Abstract: Positive-Unlabeled (PU) learning aims to train a binary classifier (positive
vs. negative) where only limited positive data and abundant unlabeled data are
available. While widely applicable, state-of-the-art PU learning methods
substantially underperform their supervised counterparts on complex datasets,
especially without auxiliary negatives or pre-estimated parameters (e.g., a
14.26% gap on CIFAR-100 dataset). We identify the primary bottleneck as the
challenge of learning discriminative representations under unreliable
supervision. To tackle this challenge, we propose NcPU, a non-contrastive PU
learning framework that requires no auxiliary information. NcPU combines a
noisy-pair robust supervised non-contrastive loss (NoiSNCL), which aligns
intra-class representations despite unreliable supervision, with a phantom
label disambiguation (PLD) scheme that supplies conservative negative
supervision via regret-based label updates. Theoretically, NoiSNCL and PLD can
iteratively benefit each other from the perspective of the
Expectation-Maximization framework. Empirically, extensive experiments
demonstrate that: (1) NoiSNCL enables simple PU methods to achieve competitive
performance; and (2) NcPU achieves substantial improvements over
state-of-the-art PU methods across diverse datasets, including challenging
datasets on post-disaster building damage mapping, highlighting its promise for
real-world applications. Code: Code will be open-sourced after review.

TL;DR: 受微眼动启发，提出一种轻量级位置编码扰动方法，无需微调即可检测LLM在事实性、安全性、毒性等方面的错误行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从人类视觉感知中的微眼动现象获得灵感，微眼动能揭示隐藏的感知动态，类似地希望找到能揭示LLM内部错误行为的探测方法。

Method: 使用轻量级位置编码扰动作为探测手段，无需微调或任务特定监督，通过扰动引发潜在信号来指示模型错误行为。

Result: 在多个先进LLM上的实验表明，该方法能有效检测事实性、安全性、毒性和后门攻击等错误，且计算效率高。

Conclusion: 预训练LLM已编码了标记自身错误的内部证据，微眼动启发的干预为检测和缓解不良行为提供了途径。

Abstract: We draw inspiration from microsaccades, tiny involuntary eye movements that
reveal hidden dynamics of human perception, to propose an analogous probing
method for large language models (LLMs). Just as microsaccades expose subtle
but informative shifts in vision, we show that lightweight position encoding
perturbations elicit latent signals that indicate model misbehaviour. Our
method requires no fine-tuning or task-specific supervision, yet detects
failures across diverse settings including factuality, safety, toxicity, and
backdoor attacks. Experiments on multiple state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate
that these perturbation-based probes surface misbehaviours while remaining
computationally efficient. These findings suggest that pretrained LLMs already
encode the internal evidence needed to flag their own failures, and that
microsaccade-inspired interventions provide a pathway for detecting and
mitigating undesirable behaviours.

TL;DR: ThinKV是一个思想自适应的KV缓存压缩框架，通过混合量化-驱逐策略显著减少大模型推理时的GPU内存占用，同时保持接近无损的精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型的长输出上下文生成导致KV缓存快速增长，迅速耗尽GPU内存，需要高效的压缩解决方案。

Method: 基于注意力稀疏性识别不同重要性的思想类型，采用混合量化-驱逐策略，按思想重要性分配token精度，并随着推理轨迹演变逐步驱逐较不重要思想的token。

Result: 在数学和编程基准测试中，ThinKV仅使用原始KV缓存不到5%的空间就实现了接近无损的精度，推理吞吐量比最先进基线提高达5.8倍。

Conclusion: ThinKV通过思想自适应压缩有效解决了大模型推理中的KV缓存内存瓶颈问题，实现了内存效率和推理性能的显著提升。

Abstract: The long-output context generation of large reasoning models enables extended
chain of thought (CoT) but also drives rapid growth of the key-value (KV)
cache, quickly overwhelming GPU memory. To address this challenge, we propose
ThinKV, a thought-adaptive KV cache compression framework. ThinKV is based on
the observation that attention sparsity reveals distinct thought types with
varying importance within the CoT. It applies a hybrid quantization-eviction
strategy, assigning token precision by thought importance and progressively
evicting tokens from less critical thoughts as reasoning trajectories evolve.
Furthermore, to implement ThinKV, we design a kernel that extends
PagedAttention to enable efficient reuse of evicted tokens' memory slots,
eliminating compaction overheads. Extensive experiments on DeepSeek-R1-Distill,
GPT-OSS, and NVIDIA AceReason across mathematics and coding benchmarks show
that ThinKV achieves near-lossless accuracy with less than 5% of the original
KV cache, while improving performance with up to 5.8x higher inference
throughput over state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: 该框架通过增强模型可迁移性，支持更可靠的交通信号优化、拥堵管理和基于性能的规划，促进机器学习技术在现实交通系统中的广泛应用。

Abstract: Accurate vehicle delay estimation is essential for evaluating the performance
of signalized intersections and informing traffic management strategies. Delay
reflects congestion levels and affects travel time reliability, fuel use, and
emissions. Machine learning (ML) offers a scalable, cost-effective alternative;
However, conventional models typically assume that training and testing data
follow the same distribution, an assumption that is rarely satisfied in
real-world applications. Variations in road geometry, signal timing, and driver
behavior across intersections often lead to poor generalization and reduced
model accuracy. To address this issue, this study introduces a domain
adaptation (DA) framework for estimating vehicle delays across diverse
intersections. The framework separates data into source and target domains,
extracts key traffic features, and fine-tunes the model using a small, labeled
subset from the target domain. A novel DA model, Gradient Boosting with
Balanced Weighting (GBBW), reweights source data based on similarity to the
target domain, improving adaptability. The framework is tested using data from
57 heterogeneous intersections in Pima County, Arizona. Performance is
evaluated against eight state-of-the-art ML regression models and seven
instance-based DA methods. Results demonstrate that the GBBW framework provides
more accurate and robust delay estimates. This approach supports more reliable
traffic signal optimization, congestion management, and performance-based
planning. By enhancing model transferability, the framework facilitates broader
deployment of machine learning techniques in real-world transportation systems.

Abstract: Deep learning-based 3-dimensional (3D) shape reconstruction from
2-dimensional (2D) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has become increasingly
important in medical disease diagnosis, treatment planning, and computational
modeling. This review surveys the methodological landscape of 3D MRI
reconstruction, focusing on 4 primary approaches: point cloud, mesh-based,
shape-aware, and volumetric models. For each category, we analyze the current
state-of-the-art techniques, their methodological foundation, limitations, and
applications across anatomical structures. We provide an extensive overview
ranging from cardiac to neurological to lung imaging. We also focus on the
clinical applicability of models to diseased anatomy, and the influence of
their training and testing data. We examine publicly available datasets,
computational demands, and evaluation metrics. Finally, we highlight the
emerging research directions including multimodal integration and
cross-modality frameworks. This review aims to provide researchers with a
structured overview of current 3D reconstruction methodologies to identify
opportunities for advancing deep learning towards more robust, generalizable,
and clinically impactful solutions.

Result: 研究发现输入权重的梯度近似低秩，由两个秩一分量主导：一个与数据残差主体对齐，另一个与输入数据中的秩一尖峰对齐。

Conclusion: 梯度结构受数据特性、缩放机制和激活函数共同影响，标准正则化方法能选择性地调节这些梯度分量，实验验证了理论预测。

Abstract: This paper investigates low-rank structure in the gradients of the training
loss for two-layer neural networks while relaxing the usual isotropy
assumptions on the training data and parameters. We consider a spiked data
model in which the bulk can be anisotropic and ill-conditioned, we do not
require independent data and weight matrices and we also analyze both the
mean-field and neural-tangent-kernel scalings. We show that the gradient with
respect to the input weights is approximately low rank and is dominated by two
rank-one terms: one aligned with the bulk data-residue , and another aligned
with the rank one spike in the input data. We characterize how properties of
the training data, the scaling regime and the activation function govern the
balance between these two components. Additionally, we also demonstrate that
standard regularizers, such as weight decay, input noise and Jacobian
penalties, also selectively modulate these components. Experiments on synthetic
and real data corroborate our theoretical predictions.

### [136] [Quantum-inspired Benchmark for Estimating Intrinsic Dimension](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01335)
*Aritra Das,Joseph T. Iosue,Victor V. Albert*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个量子启发的内在维度估计基准QuIIEst，包含无限系列的拓扑非平凡流形，用于评估IDE方法在复杂流形上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有IDE方法在真实数据集上估计结果差异很大，需要更复杂的基准来评估这些方法，因为真实数据集通常位于具有小内在维度的潜在流形上。

Method: 基于量子光学方法构建QuIIEst基准，可以嵌入任意齐次空间，同时允许曲率修改和添加噪声，包含无限系列的拓扑非平凡流形。

Result: 在QuIIEst流形上测试的IDE方法普遍比现有基准准确性更低，且随着曲率不均匀性增加性能下降最小，表明基准具有固有难度。

Conclusion: QuIIEst基准为IDE方法提供了更具挑战性的测试平台，并在分形Hofstadter蝴蝶上识别了能够提取非流形空间有效维度的方法。

Abstract: Machine learning models can generalize well on real-world datasets. According
to the manifold hypothesis, this is possible because datasets lie on a latent
manifold with small intrinsic dimension (ID). There exist many methods for ID
estimation (IDE), but their estimates vary substantially. This warrants
benchmarking IDE methods on manifolds that are more complex than those in
existing benchmarks. We propose a Quantum-Inspired Intrinsic-dimension
Estimation (QuIIEst) benchmark consisting of infinite families of topologically
non-trivial manifolds with known ID. Our benchmark stems from a quantum-optical
method of embedding arbitrary homogeneous spaces while allowing for curvature
modification and additive noise. The IDE methods tested were generally less
accurate on QuIIEst manifolds than on existing benchmarks under identical
resource allocation. We also observe minimal performance degradation with
increasingly non-uniform curvature, underscoring the benchmark's inherent
difficulty. As a result of independent interest, we perform IDE on the fractal
Hofstadter's butterfly and identify which methods are capable of extracting the
effective dimension of a space that is not a manifold.

Abstract: We study the identifiability of latent action policy learning (LAPO), a
framework introduced recently to discover representations of actions from video

statistical benefits and potential sources of unidentifiability. Finally, we
prove that an entropy-regularized LAPO objective identifies action
representations satisfying our desiderata, under suitable conditions. Our
analysis provides an explanation for why discrete action representations
perform well in practice.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文从变分互信息下界出发，推导出两种自监督表示学习训练范式：自蒸馏互信息(SDMI)和联合互信息(JMI)，为现有方法的架构组件提供了理论解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自监督表示学习虽然取得了显著经验成功，但其基本原理理解不足。现有工作往往将预测器网络、停止梯度操作等架构元素视为经验性补充，缺乏理论依据。

Method: 从变分互信息下界出发，推导出SDMI和JMI两种训练范式。SDMI需要交替优化，停止梯度操作理论必要；JMI允许通过对称架构进行联合优化。

Result: 预测器网络在SDMI中、统计正则化器在JMI中作为互信息目标的可行替代方案出现。证明许多现有SSRL方法是这两种范式的具体实例或近似。

Conclusion: 为现有SSRL方法的不同架构组件选择提供了超越启发式便利的理论解释，统一了自监督表示学习的理论基础。

Abstract: Self-supervised representation learning (SSRL) has demonstrated remarkable
empirical success, yet its underlying principles remain insufficiently
understood. While recent works attempt to unify SSRL methods by examining their
information-theoretic objectives or summarizing their heuristics for preventing
representation collapse, architectural elements like the predictor network,
stop-gradient operation, and statistical regularizer are often viewed as
empirically motivated additions. In this paper, we adopt a first-principles
approach and investigate whether the learning objective of an SSRL algorithm
dictates its possible optimization strategies and model design choices. In
particular, by starting from a variational mutual information (MI) lower bound,
we derive two training paradigms, namely Self-Distillation MI (SDMI) and Joint
MI (JMI), each imposing distinct structural constraints and covering a set of
existing SSRL algorithms. SDMI inherently requires alternating optimization,
making stop-gradient operations theoretically essential. In contrast, JMI
admits joint optimization through symmetric architectures without such
components. Under the proposed formulation, predictor networks in SDMI and
statistical regularizers in JMI emerge as tractable surrogates for the MI
objective. We show that many existing SSRL methods are specific instances or
approximations of these two paradigms. This paper provides a theoretical
explanation behind the choices of different architectural components of
existing SSRL methods, beyond heuristic conveniences.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种量化数据集各向异性程度的度量方法，通过双样本神经分类器测试来区分原始数据集与其随机增强版本，揭示了基准点云数据集中存在的高度对齐现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对称感知方法（如数据增强和等变架构）假设变换后的数据点在测试分布中具有高概率或"重要性"。本文旨在批判性评估这一假设，开发量化数据集各向异性的方法。

Method: 提出基于双样本神经分类器测试的度量方法，区分原始数据集与随机增强版本以量化各向异性程度。在合成数据集上验证后应用于基准点云数据集分析。

Result: 在多个基准点云数据集中发现了出乎意料的高度对齐现象。理论分析表明分布对称性破坏可能阻止不变方法达到最优性能，即使底层标签确实是不变的。

Conclusion: 等变方法的有效性具有数据集依赖性：在某些各向异性数据集上仍有益处，但在其他数据集上则不然。理解等变性需要重新思考数据中的对称性偏差。

Abstract: Symmetry-aware methods for machine learning, such as data augmentation and
equivariant architectures, encourage correct model behavior on all
transformations (e.g. rotations or permutations) of the original dataset. These
methods can improve generalization and sample efficiency, under the assumption
that the transformed datapoints are highly probable, or "important", under the
test distribution. In this work, we develop a method for critically evaluating
this assumption. In particular, we propose a metric to quantify the amount of
anisotropy, or symmetry-breaking, in a dataset, via a two-sample neural
classifier test that distinguishes between the original dataset and its
randomly augmented equivalent. We validate our metric on synthetic datasets,
and then use it to uncover surprisingly high degrees of alignment in several
benchmark point cloud datasets. We show theoretically that distributional
symmetry-breaking can actually prevent invariant methods from performing
optimally even when the underlying labels are truly invariant, as we show for
invariant ridge regression in the infinite feature limit. Empirically, we find
that the implication for symmetry-aware methods is dataset-dependent:
equivariant methods still impart benefits on some anisotropic datasets, but not
others. Overall, these findings suggest that understanding equivariance -- both
when it works, and why -- may require rethinking symmetry biases in the data.

Abstract: The ability to model mechanics of soft materials under flowing conditions is
key in designing and engineering processes and materials with targeted
properties. This generally requires solution of internal stress tensor, related
to the deformation tensor through nonlinear and history-dependent constitutive
models. Traditional numerical methods for non-Newtonian fluid dynamics often
suffer from prohibitive computational demands and poor scalability to new
problem instances. Developments in data-driven methods have mitigated some
limitations but still require retraining across varied physical conditions. In
this work, we introduce Rheological Operator Transformer (RheOFormer), a
generative operator learning method leveraging self-attention to efficiently
learn different spatial interactions and features of complex fluid flows. We
benchmark RheOFormer across a range of different viscometric and
non-viscometric flows with different types of viscoelastic and
elastoviscoplastic mechanics in complex domains against ground truth solutions.
Our results demonstrate that RheOFormer can accurately learn both scalar and
tensorial nonlinear mechanics of different complex fluids and predict the
spatio-temporal evolution of their flows, even when trained on limited
datasets. Its strong generalization capabilities and computational efficiency
establish RheOFormer as a robust neural surrogate for accelerating predictive
complex fluid simulations, advancing data-driven experimentation, and enabling
real-time process optimization across a wide range of applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了选择性欠拟合的概念，认为更好的扩散模型在输入空间的某些区域更准确地逼近分数函数，而在其他区域则欠拟合，这对于理解扩散模型的泛化能力至关重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在训练时学习分数函数用于生成样本，但一个基本未解的问题是：它们实际学习的是哪个分数？如果完全匹配经验分数会简单地复制训练数据而无法生成新样本。

Method: 引入选择性欠拟合概念，通过表征这些区域并设计经验干预来验证这一观点。

Result: 研究结果表明选择性欠拟合对于理解扩散模型至关重要，为它们的泛化和生成性能提供了新的可测试见解。

Conclusion: 选择性欠拟合是理解扩散模型泛化能力的关键机制，更好的模型在特定区域更准确地学习分数函数，而在其他区域故意欠拟合以实现有效生成。

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as the principal paradigm for generative
modeling across various domains. During training, they learn the score
function, which in turn is used to generate samples at inference. They raise a
basic yet unsolved question: which score do they actually learn? In principle,
a diffusion model that matches the empirical score in the entire data space
would simply reproduce the training data, failing to generate novel samples.
Recent work addresses this question by arguing that diffusion models underfit
the empirical score due to training-time inductive biases. In this work, we
refine this perspective, introducing the notion of selective underfitting:
instead of underfitting the score everywhere, better diffusion models more
accurately approximate the score in certain regions of input space, while
underfitting it in others. We characterize these regions and design empirical
interventions to validate our perspective. Our results establish that selective
underfitting is essential for understanding diffusion models, yielding new,
testable insights into their generalization and generative performance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PRISM是一种轻量级、模型无关的方法，用于掩码扩散模型在推理时的自校正，通过定义自校正损失来学习每个token的质量分数，无需强化学习或验证器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成模型需要自校正能力——在推理时检测和修正低质量token。虽然掩码扩散模型在离散空间生成建模中表现出潜力，但其自校正能力仍未被充分理解。

Method: PRISM通过定义自校正损失来学习每个token的质量分数，这些质量分数与MDM在同一前向传播中计算，用于检测低质量token。

Result: PRISM在多个领域和规模上推进了MDM推理：数独、无条件文本（170M）以及使用LLaDA的代码（8B）。

Conclusion: PRISM为预训练的掩码扩散模型提供了一种轻量级、模型无关的自校正方法，无需改变模型架构或训练过程。

Abstract: A natural desideratum for generative models is self-correction--detecting and
revising low-quality tokens at inference. While Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs)
have emerged as a promising approach for generative modeling in discrete
spaces, their capacity for self-correction remains poorly understood. Prior
attempts to incorporate self-correction into MDMs either require overhauling
MDM architectures/training or rely on imprecise proxies for token quality,
limiting their applicability. Motivated by this, we introduce PRISM--Plug-in
Remasking for Inference-time Self-correction of Masked Diffusions--a
lightweight, model-agnostic approach that applies to any pretrained MDM.
Theoretically, PRISM defines a self-correction loss that provably learns
per-token quality scores, without RL or a verifier. These quality scores are
computed in the same forward pass with MDM and used to detect low-quality
tokens. Empirically, PRISM advances MDM inference across domains and scales:
Sudoku; unconditional text (170M); and code with LLaDA (8B).

Result: 在AlpacaFarm和HH-RLHF数据集上的实验表明，自适应策略能达到与Best-of-N采样相同的性能，同时平均减少15-35%的生成次数。

Conclusion: 建立了最优停止理论与推理时扩展之间的原则性桥梁，为LLM部署提供了理论性能保证和实际效率提升。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) generation often requires balancing output quality
against inference cost, especially when using multiple generations. We
introduce a new framework for inference-time optimization based on the
classical Pandora's Box problem. Viewing each generation as opening a costly
"box" with random reward, we develop algorithms that decide when to stop
generating without knowing the underlying reward distribution. Our first
contribution is a UCB-style Pandora's Box algorithm, which achieves performance
that is provably close to Weitzman's algorithm, the optimal strategy when the
distribution is known. We further adapt this method to practical LLM settings
by addressing reward scaling across prompts via a Bradley-Terry inspired
transformation. This leads to an adaptive inference-time optimization method
that normalizes rewards and learns stopping thresholds on the fly. Experiments
on the AlpacaFarm and HH-RLHF datasets, using multiple LLM-reward model pairs,
show that our adaptive strategy can obtain the same performance as non-adaptive
Best-of-N sampling while requiring 15-35 percent fewer generations on average.
Our results establish a principled bridge between optimal stopping theory and
inference-time scaling, providing both theoretical performance bounds and
practical efficiency gains for LLM deployment.

Conclusion: 该框架使基于梯度的自由能方法能够整合复杂和机器学习的集体变量，扩展了生物化学和材料模拟的应用范围。

Abstract: Free energy reconstruction methods such as Gaussian Process Regression (GPR)
require Jacobians of the collective variables (CVs), a bottleneck that
restricts the use of complex or machine-learned CVs. We introduce a neural
network surrogate framework that learns CVs directly from Cartesian coordinates
and uses automatic differentiation to provide Jacobians, bypassing analytical
forms. On an MgCl2 ion-pairing system, our method achieved high accuracy for
both a simple distance CV and a complex coordination-number CV. Moreover,
Jacobian errors also followed a near-Gaussian distribution, making them
suitable for GPR pipelines. This framework enables gradient-based free energy
methods to incorporate complex and machine-learned CVs, broadening the scope of
biochemistry and materials simulations.

Conclusion: 基于低秩表示的压缩重建框架有效解决了神经压缩中的解码器瓶颈问题，为实际应用提供了可行的解决方案

Abstract: Image compression and reconstruction are crucial for various digital
applications. While contemporary neural compression methods achieve impressive
compression rates, the adoption of such technology has been largely hindered by
the complexity and large computational costs of the convolution-based decoders
during data reconstruction. To address the decoder bottleneck in neural
compression, we develop a new compression-reconstruction framework based on
incorporating low-rank representation in an autoencoder with vector
quantization. We demonstrated that performing a series of computationally
efficient low-rank operations on the learned latent representation of images
can efficiently reconstruct the data with high quality. Our approach
dramatically reduces the computational overhead in the decoding phase of neural
compression/reconstruction, essentially eliminating the decoder compute
bottleneck while maintaining high fidelity of image outputs.

TL;DR: SoftAdaClip是一种差分隐私训练方法，用平滑的tanh变换替代硬裁剪，在保持梯度相对大小的同时限制敏感度，显著减少了子群体间的不公平性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 差分隐私虽然提供强隐私保护，但会降低模型性能和公平性，特别是对少数群体。梯度裁剪会不成比例地抑制少数子群体的学习信号。

Method: 提出SoftAdaClip方法，用基于tanh的平滑变换替代硬裁剪，保持梯度相对大小同时限制敏感度。

Result: 在多个数据集上测试显示，SoftAdaClip相比DP-SGD减少子群体差异达87%，相比Adaptive-DPSGD减少达48%，且这些减少具有统计显著性。

Conclusion: 将平滑变换与自适应机制结合对于实现公平且私有的模型训练至关重要。

Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) provides strong protection for sensitive data, but
often reduces model performance and fairness, especially for underrepresented
groups. One major reason is gradient clipping in DP-SGD, which can
disproportionately suppress learning signals for minority subpopulations.
Although adaptive clipping can enhance utility, it still relies on uniform hard
clipping, which may restrict fairness. To address this, we introduce
SoftAdaClip, a differentially private training method that replaces hard
clipping with a smooth, tanh-based transformation to preserve relative gradient
magnitudes while bounding sensitivity. We evaluate SoftAdaClip on various
datasets, including MIMIC-III (clinical text), GOSSIS-eICU (structured
healthcare), and Adult Income (tabular data). Our results show that SoftAdaClip
reduces subgroup disparities by up to 87% compared to DP-SGD and up to 48%
compared to Adaptive-DPSGD, and these reductions in subgroup disparities are
statistically significant. These findings underscore the importance of
integrating smooth transformations with adaptive mechanisms to achieve fair and
private model training.

Result: 实验验证了LLA在测试时回归、上下文回归、关联回忆和状态跟踪任务中的优势。LLA能有效适应非平稳性，在测试时训练和上下文学习中优于强基线，并展现出在大规模模型中可扩展性和适用性的潜力。

Conclusion: LLA作为一种理论驱动的新型注意力机制，在多个任务中表现出优越性能，特别是在处理非平稳数据方面，为大规模模型应用提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Transformer architectures have achieved remarkable success in various
domains. While efficient alternatives to Softmax Attention have been widely
studied, the search for more expressive mechanisms grounded in theoretical
insight-even at greater computational cost-has been relatively underexplored.
In this work, we bridge this gap by proposing Local Linear Attention (LLA), a
novel attention mechanism derived from nonparametric statistics through the
lens of test-time regression. First, we show that LLA offers theoretical
advantages over Linear and Softmax Attention for associative memory via a
bias-variance trade-off analysis. Next, we address its computational challenges
and propose two memory-efficient primitives to tackle the $\Theta(n^2 d)$ and
$\Theta(n d^2)$ complexity. We then introduce FlashLLA, a hardware-efficient,
blockwise algorithm that enables scalable and parallel computation on modern
accelerators. In addition, we implement and profile a customized inference
kernel that significantly reduces memory overheads. Finally, we empirically
validate the advantages and limitations of LLA on test-time regression,
in-context regression, associative recall and state tracking tasks. Experiment
results demonstrate that LLA effectively adapts to non-stationarity,
outperforming strong baselines in test-time training and in-context learning,
and exhibiting promising evidence for its scalability and applicability in
large-scale models. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的扩散模型OOD检测方法计算成本高，需要大量前向传播，限制了实际应用。需要开发更高效的方法来支持机器学习和AI系统在现实世界中的可靠部署。

Conclusion: SCOPED为现实世界领域中的快速可靠OOD检测提供了实用基础，适用于视觉感知伪影、自回归模型中的异常检测、强化学习探索和无监督训练的数据集管理。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is essential for reliable deployment of
machine learning systems in vision, robotics, reinforcement learning, and
beyond. We introduce Score-Curvature Out-of-distribution Proximity Evaluator
for Diffusion (SCOPED), a fast and general-purpose OOD detection method for
diffusion models that reduces the number of forward passes on the trained model
by an order of magnitude compared to prior methods, outperforming most
diffusion-based baselines and closely approaching the accuracy of the strongest
ones. SCOPED is computed from a single diffusion model trained once on a
diverse dataset, and combines the Jacobian trace and squared norm of the
model's score function into a single test statistic. Rather than thresholding
on a fixed value, we estimate the in-distribution density of SCOPED scores
using kernel density estimation, enabling a flexible, unsupervised test that,
in the simplest case, only requires a single forward pass and one
Jacobian-vector product (JVP), made efficient by Hutchinson's trace estimator.
On four vision benchmarks, SCOPED achieves competitive or state-of-the-art
precision-recall scores despite its low computational cost. The same method
generalizes to robotic control tasks with shared state and action spaces,
identifying distribution shifts across reward functions and training regimes.
These results position SCOPED as a practical foundation for fast and reliable
OOD detection in real-world domains, including perceptual artifacts in vision,
outlier detection in autoregressive models, exploration in reinforcement
learning, and dataset curation for unsupervised training.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文分析了基于模型的强化学习算法MBPO在DeepMind Control Suite中表现不佳的原因，识别了动态模型与奖励模型尺度不匹配、目标表示选择不当两个关键问题，并提出了解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究为什么在OpenAI Gym中表现优异的MBPO算法在DeepMind Control Suite中会严重失效，揭示环境特定假设如何隐式影响算法设计，并寻求统一的解决方案。

Method: 通过分析MBPO在七个挑战性DMC任务中的失败案例，识别出两个耦合问题：动态模型与奖励模型的尺度不匹配导致critic低估，以及目标表示选择不当增加模型方差。针对这些问题提出改进方案。

Result: 解决这些失败模式后，MBPO在七个任务中的五个任务上超越了其模型自由对应算法SAC，同时在OpenAI Gym中保持了原有的优异性能。

Conclusion: 研究强调了将MDP任务和环境结构与算法失败模式联系起来的重要性，呼吁开发统一的解决方案，并澄清基准选择如何最终决定算法的泛化条件。

Abstract: Synthetic data is a core component of data-efficient Dyna-style model-based
reinforcement learning, yet it can also degrade performance. We study when it
helps, where it fails, and why, and we show that addressing the resulting
failure modes enables policy improvement that was previously unattainable. We
focus on Model-Based Policy Optimization (MBPO), which performs actor and
critic updates using synthetic action counterfactuals. Despite reports of
strong and generalizable sample-efficiency gains in OpenAI Gym, recent work
shows that MBPO often underperforms its model-free counterpart, Soft
Actor-Critic (SAC), in the DeepMind Control Suite (DMC). Although both suites
involve continuous control with proprioceptive robots, this shift leads to
sharp performance losses across seven challenging DMC tasks, with MBPO failing
in cases where claims of generalization from Gym would imply success. This
reveals how environment-specific assumptions can become implicitly encoded into
algorithm design when evaluation is limited. We identify two coupled issues
behind these failures: scale mismatches between dynamics and reward models that
induce critic underestimation and hinder policy improvement during model-policy
coevolution, and a poor choice of target representation that inflates model
variance and produces error-prone rollouts. Addressing these failure modes
enables policy improvement where none was previously possible, allowing MBPO to
outperform SAC in five of seven tasks while preserving the strong performance
previously reported in OpenAI Gym. Rather than aiming only for incremental
average gains, we hope our findings motivate the community to develop
taxonomies that tie MDP task- and environment-level structure to algorithmic
failure modes, pursue unified solutions where possible, and clarify how
benchmark choices ultimately shape the conditions under which algorithms
generalize.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) advance their capabilities, aligning these
models with human preferences has become crucial. Preference optimization,
which trains models to distinguish between preferred and non-preferred
responses based on human feedback, has become a crucial component for aligning
LLMs. However, most existing works assume noise-free feedback, which is
unrealistic due to the inherent errors and inconsistencies in human judgments.
This paper addresses the impact of noisy feedback on preference optimization,
providing generalization guarantees under these conditions. In particular, we
consider noise models that correspond to common real-world sources of noise,
such as mislabeling and uncertainty. Unlike traditional analyses that assume
convergence, our work focuses on finite-step preference optimization, offering
new insights that are more aligned with practical LLM training. We describe how
generalization decays with different types of noise across levels of noise
rates based on the preference data distribution and number of samples. Our
analysis for noisy preference learning applies to a broad family of preference
optimization losses such as DPO, IPO, SLiC, etc. Empirical validation on
contemporary LLMs confirms the practical relevance of our findings, offering
valuable insights for developing AI systems that align with human preferences.

Conclusion: 提供了将长度信号融入动态采样的替代方法见解，指明了未来研究方向

Abstract: Since the release of Deepseek-R1, reinforcement learning with verifiable
rewards (RLVR) has become a central approach for training large language models
(LLMs) on reasoning tasks. Recent work has largely focused on modifying loss
functions to make RLVR more efficient and effective. In this paper, motivated
by studies of overthinking in LLMs, we propose Length-aware Sampling for Policy
Optimization (LSPO), a novel meta-RLVR algorithm that dynamically selects
training data at each step based on the average response length. We evaluate
LSPO across multiple base models and datasets, demonstrating that it
consistently improves learning effectiveness. In addition, we conduct a
detailed ablation study to examine alternative ways of incorporating length
signals into dynamic sampling, offering further insights and highlighting
promising directions for future research.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个稳定性-可塑性原则来解释离线到在线强化学习中设计选择不一致的问题，强调在在线微调时应保留预训练策略或离线数据集中更好的知识，同时保持足够的可塑性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离线到在线强化学习的经验行为高度不一致，在一种设置中有效的在线微调设计选择在另一种设置中可能完全失败，需要理论框架来解释和指导设计选择。

Method: 提出稳定性-可塑性原则，识别了三种在线微调机制，每种机制需要不同的稳定性特性，并通过大规模实证研究验证该框架。

Result: 在63个案例中的45个案例中，实证结果与该框架的预测高度一致，验证了该原则的有效性。

Conclusion: 该工作为基于离线数据集和预训练策略相对性能的离线到在线强化学习设计选择提供了原则性框架。

Abstract: Offline-to-online reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a practical
paradigm that leverages offline datasets for pretraining and online
interactions for fine-tuning. However, its empirical behavior is highly
inconsistent: design choices of online-fine tuning that work well in one
setting can fail completely in another. We propose a stability--plasticity
principle that can explain this inconsistency: we should preserve the knowledge
of pretrained policy or offline dataset during online fine-tuning, whichever is
better, while maintaining sufficient plasticity. This perspective identifies
three regimes of online fine-tuning, each requiring distinct stability
properties. We validate this framework through a large-scale empirical study,
finding that the results strongly align with its predictions in 45 of 63 cases.
This work provides a principled framework for guiding design choices in
offline-to-online RL based on the relative performance of the offline dataset
and the pretrained policy.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于LLM的贝叶斯优化方法，使用LoRA微调和变分贝叶斯线性层来处理高维不规则变量的黑盒优化问题，并通过集成方法自动选择超参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统高斯过程在应对高维不规则变量（如分类、序数变量）的黑盒优化问题时表现不佳，而神经网络替代模型计算成本高。受LLM强大能力启发，将其作为替代模型来解决这一问题。

Method: 使用LoRA微调LLM参数，结合变分贝叶斯线性层框架，构建轻量级可递归更新的LoRA-VBLL模型。采用加权集成方法自动选择LoRA秩等超参数，支持持续更新。

Result: 在多种高维基准测试和真实世界分子优化任务中，所提出的(ENS-)LoRA-VBLL方法表现出色。

Conclusion: 基于LLM的替代模型结合LoRA-VBLL框架，为高维不规则变量的黑盒优化问题提供了高效解决方案，在计算效率和性能方面均优于现有方法。

Abstract: A plethora of applications entail solving black-box optimization problems
with high evaluation costs, including drug discovery, material design, as well
as hyperparameter tuning. Toward finding the global optimum of such black-box
optimization problems with sample efficiency, Bayesian optimization (BO) is a
theoretically elegant framework that relies on a probabilistic surrogate model
so as to iteratively select the query point with well-balanced
exploration-exploitation tradeoffs. The Gaussian process (GP), as the de-facto
choice for surrogate modeling, has achieved compelling performances for vanilla
BO with low-dimensional continuous variables. However, GPs fall short in coping
with high-dimensional counterparts with {\it irregular} variables (e.g.,
categorical, ordinal, etc.). To alleviate this, neural network-based surrogates
have been explored. Inspired by the powerful capabilities of LLMs, we adopt the
LLM as the surrogate to model the mapping from the high-dimensional input
variables to the objective function. To adapt to the current problem, we
leverage the low-rank adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune the LLM parameters
together with the posterior of a linear regression head via the variational
Bayesian last layer (VBLL) framework. The resulting LoRA-VBLL is not only
computationally light compared to existing alternatives, but also admits
recursive updates. To automate the critical selection of the LoRA rank as well
as other hyperparameters, a weighted ensemble (ENS) of LoRA-VBLL surrogates has
been devised, which further accommodates continual update of the per-model
weight and individual LoRA-VBLL parameters via recursive Bayes. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate the compelling performance of the proposed
(ENS-)LoRA-VBLL approaches on various high-dimensional benchmarks and the
real-world molecular optimization tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PEL-NAS是一种基于大语言模型的神经架构搜索方法，通过搜索空间分区、架构提示协同进化和零成本预测器，解决了传统方法搜索成本高和LLM驱动方法探索偏差的问题，实现了高精度低延迟的神经网络设计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统超网方法需要多GPU天/数据集，LLM驱动方法虽然快速但存在探索偏差，无法在完整搜索空间中跨不同延迟范围发现架构。需要一种既能降低搜索成本又能避免探索偏差的NAS方法。

Method: 1) 复杂度驱动分区引擎：按复杂度划分搜索空间以增强多样性；2) LLM驱动的架构提示协同进化：LLM基于前轮结果更新设计启发式知识库，然后执行引导进化算法；3) 零成本预测器：避免从头训练大量候选架构。

Result: 在HW-NAS-Bench上，PEL-NAS相比基线实现了更高的HV、更低的IGD，在相似精度下延迟降低54%。搜索成本从数天降至数分钟。

Conclusion: PEL-NAS通过搜索空间分区和LLM驱动的协同进化，有效解决了硬件感知NAS中的探索偏差问题，显著降低了搜索成本，同时实现了更好的精度-延迟权衡。

Abstract: Hardware-Aware Neural Architecture Search (HW-NAS) requires joint
optimization of accuracy and latency under device constraints. Traditional
supernet-based methods require multiple GPU days per dataset. Large Language
Model (LLM)-driven approaches avoid training a large supernet and can provide
quick feedback, but we observe an exploration bias: the LLM repeatedly proposes
neural network designs within limited search space and fails to discover
architectures across different latency ranges in the entire search space. To
address this issue, we propose PEL-NAS: a search space Partitioned,
architecture prompt co-Evolutionary and LLM-driven Neural Architecture Search
that can generate neural networks with high accuracy and low latency with
reduced search cost. Our proposed PEL-NAS has three key components: 1) a
complexity-driven partitioning engine that divides the search space by
complexity to enforce diversity and mitigate exploration bias; 2) an
LLM-powered architecture prompt co-evolution operator, in which the LLM first
updates a knowledge base of design heuristics based on results from the
previous round, then performs a guided evolution algorithm on architectures
with prompts that incorporate this knowledge base. Prompts and designs improve
together across rounds which avoids random guesswork and improve efficiency; 3)
a zero-cost predictor to avoid training a large number of candidates from
scratch. Experimental results show that on HW-NAS-Bench, PEL-NAS can achieve
overall higher HV, lower IGD, and up to 54% lower latency than baselines at
similar accuracy. Meanwhile, the search cost drops from days to minutes
compared with traditional supernet baselines.

TL;DR: 提出Weighted BC方法，使用小规模清洁参考集通过二元判别器估计轨迹级密度比，在行为克隆目标中加权以优先清洁专家行为，提升离线强化学习在数据污染场景下的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离线强化学习数据集常被对抗性投毒、系统错误或低质量样本污染，导致标准行为克隆和离线RL方法性能下降，需要开发对数据污染具有鲁棒性的方法。

Method: 使用小规模清洁参考集训练二元判别器估计轨迹级密度比，对密度比进行裁剪后作为权重应用于行为克隆目标，优先学习清洁专家行为，无需了解污染机制。

Result: 在连续控制基准测试中，即使在高污染率下，Weighted BC仍能保持接近最优性能，优于传统BC、BCQ和BRAC等基线方法。

Conclusion: Weighted BC通过密度比加权有效提升了离线强化学习在数据污染场景下的鲁棒性，具有理论保证和实际应用价值。

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) enables policy optimization from fixed
datasets, making it suitable for safety-critical applications where online
exploration is infeasible. However, these datasets are often contaminated by
adversarial poisoning, system errors, or low-quality samples, leading to
degraded policy performance in standard behavioral cloning (BC) and offline RL
methods. This paper introduces Density-Ratio Weighted Behavioral Cloning
(Weighted BC), a robust imitation learning approach that uses a small, verified
clean reference set to estimate trajectory-level density ratios via a binary
discriminator. These ratios are clipped and used as weights in the BC objective
to prioritize clean expert behavior while down-weighting or discarding
corrupted data, without requiring knowledge of the contamination mechanism. We
establish theoretical guarantees showing convergence to the clean expert policy
with finite-sample bounds that are independent of the contamination rate. A
comprehensive evaluation framework is established, which incorporates various
poisoning protocols (reward, state, transition, and action) on continuous
control benchmarks. Experiments demonstrate that Weighted BC maintains
near-optimal performance even at high contamination ratios outperforming
baselines such as traditional BC, batch-constrained Q-learning (BCQ) and
behavior regularized actor-critic (BRAC).

TL;DR: 本文提出了对抗攻击可转移性的基本区分：输入数据空间的攻击可以转移，而模型表示空间的攻击无法转移（除非表示空间几何对齐）。通过理论证明和四个实验验证了这一假设。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解释为什么图像对抗样本和文本越狱攻击能在模型间转移，而视觉语言模型的图像越狱攻击却无法转移的显著差异。

Method: 1. 在简单网络设置中数学证明区分；2. 构建图像分类器的表示空间攻击；3. 构建语言模型的表示空间越狱攻击；4. 构建视觉语言模型的数据空间攻击和表示空间攻击。

Result: 数据空间攻击成功转移，表示空间攻击无法转移（除非表示几何对齐）。表示空间攻击对目标模型有效但无法跨模型转移。

Conclusion: 对抗攻击的可转移性不是所有攻击的固有属性，而是取决于其操作域——共享数据空间与模型独特表示空间，这对构建更鲁棒模型具有关键意义。

Abstract: The field of adversarial robustness has long established that adversarial
examples can successfully transfer between image classifiers and that text
jailbreaks can successfully transfer between language models (LMs). However, a
pair of recent studies reported being unable to successfully transfer image
jailbreaks between vision-language models (VLMs). To explain this striking
difference, we propose a fundamental distinction regarding the transferability
of attacks against machine learning models: attacks in the input data-space can
transfer, whereas attacks in model representation space do not, at least not
without geometric alignment of representations. We then provide theoretical and
empirical evidence of this hypothesis in four different settings. First, we
mathematically prove this distinction in a simple setting where two networks
compute the same input-output map but via different representations. Second, we
construct representation-space attacks against image classifiers that are as
successful as well-known data-space attacks, but fail to transfer. Third, we
construct representation-space attacks against LMs that successfully jailbreak
the attacked models but again fail to transfer. Fourth, we construct data-space
attacks against VLMs that successfully transfer to new VLMs, and we show that
representation space attacks \emph{can} transfer when VLMs' latent geometries
are sufficiently aligned in post-projector space. Our work reveals that
adversarial transfer is not an inherent property of all attacks but contingent
on their operational domain - the shared data-space versus models' unique
representation spaces - a critical insight for building more robust models.

Result: 在合成数据集、LLM微调基准(UltraFeedback、MMLU)和真实医疗场景(ARMMAN)上的实证验证表明，两种方法在所有情况下都一致优于多数投票。

Conclusion: OW和ISP方法不仅提供了实际性能提升，还为设计鲁棒的多智能体LLM流水线提供了概念性洞见，能够产生更可靠的集体决策。

Abstract: With the rapid progress of multi-agent large language model (LLM) reasoning,
how to effectively aggregate answers from multiple LLMs has emerged as a
fundamental challenge. Standard majority voting treats all answers equally,
failing to consider latent heterogeneity and correlation across models. In this
work, we design two new aggregation algorithms called Optimal Weight (OW) and
Inverse Surprising Popularity (ISP), leveraging both first-order and
second-order information. Our theoretical analysis shows these methods provably
mitigate inherent limitations of majority voting under mild assumptions,
leading to more reliable collective decisions. We empirically validate our
algorithms on synthetic datasets, popular LLM fine-tuning benchmarks such as
UltraFeedback and MMLU, and a real-world healthcare setting ARMMAN. Across all
cases, our methods consistently outperform majority voting, offering both
practical performance gains and conceptual insights for the design of robust
multi-agent LLM pipelines.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) applications in Clinical Decision Support Systems
(CDSS) frequently encounter skepticism from practitioners regarding inoperable
dosing decisions. We address this challenge with an end-to-end approach for
learning optimal drug dosing and control policies for dual vasopressor
administration in intensive care unit (ICU) patients with septic shock. For
realistic drug dosing, we apply action space design that accommodates discrete,
continuous, and directional dosing strategies in a system that combines offline
conservative Q-learning with a novel recurrent modeling in a replay buffer to
capture temporal dependencies in ICU time-series data. Our comparative analysis
of norepinephrine dosing strategies across different action space formulations
reveals that the designed action spaces improve interpretability and facilitate
clinical adoption while preserving efficacy. Empirical results1 on eICU and
MIMIC demonstrate that action space design profoundly influences learned
behavioral policies. The proposed methods achieve improved patient outcomes of
over 15% in survival improvement probability, while aligning with established
clinical protocols.

Conclusion: 概率节点关系等变性是提升知识图谱基础模型表达能力的有效方法，Flock模型在零样本链接预测任务中表现出色。

Abstract: We study the problem of zero-shot link prediction on knowledge graphs (KGs),
which requires models to generalize over novel entities and novel relations.
Knowledge graph foundation models (KGFMs) address this task by enforcing
equivariance over both nodes and relations, learning from structural properties
of nodes and relations, which are then transferable to novel graphs with
similar structural properties. However, the conventional notion of
deterministic equivariance imposes inherent limits on the expressive power of
KGFMs, preventing them from distinguishing structurally similar but
semantically distinct relations. To overcome this limitation, we introduce
probabilistic node-relation equivariance, which preserves equivariance in
distribution while incorporating a principled randomization to break symmetries
during inference. Building on this principle, we present Flock, a KGFM that
iteratively samples random walks, encodes them into sequences via a recording
protocol, embeds them with a sequence model, and aggregates representations of
nodes and relations via learned pooling. Crucially, Flock respects
probabilistic node-relation equivariance and is a universal approximator for
isomorphism-invariant link-level functions over KGs. Empirically, Flock
perfectly solves our new diagnostic dataset Petals where current KGFMs fail,
and achieves state-of-the-art performances on entity- and relation prediction
tasks on 54 KGs from diverse domains.

Abstract: The safe use of pharmaceuticals in food-producing animals is vital to protect
animal welfare and human food safety. Adverse events (AEs) may signal
unexpected pharmacokinetic or toxicokinetic effects, increasing the risk of
violative residues in the food chain. This study introduces a predictive
framework for classifying outcomes (Death vs. Recovery) using ~1.28 million
reports (1987-2025 Q1) from the U.S. FDA's OpenFDA Center for Veterinary
Medicine. A preprocessing pipeline merged relational tables and standardized
AEs through VeDDRA ontologies. Data were normalized, missing values imputed,
and high-cardinality features reduced; physicochemical drug properties were
integrated to capture chemical-residue links. We evaluated supervised models,
including Random Forest, CatBoost, XGBoost, ExcelFormer, and large language
models (Gemma 3-27B, Phi 3-12B). Class imbalance was addressed, such as
undersampling and oversampling, with a focus on prioritizing recall for fatal
outcomes. Ensemble methods(Voting, Stacking) and CatBoost performed best,
achieving precision, recall, and F1-scores of 0.95. Incorporating Average
Uncertainty Margin (AUM)-based pseudo-labeling of uncertain cases improved
minority-class detection, particularly in ExcelFormer and XGBoost.
Interpretability via SHAP identified biologically plausible predictors,
including lung, heart, and bronchial disorders, animal demographics, and drug
physicochemical properties. These features were strongly linked to fatal
outcomes. Overall, the framework shows that combining rigorous data
engineering, advanced machine learning, and explainable AI enables accurate,
interpretable predictions of veterinary safety outcomes. The approach supports
FARAD's mission by enabling early detection of high-risk drug-event profiles,
strengthening residue risk assessment, and informing regulatory and clinical
decision-making.

(ii) they depend on separate grid-specific models that make it challenging to
provide global coverage; and (iii) they provide forecasts without uncertainty
estimates, limiting reliability for downstream carbon-aware applications.
  In this paper, we present CarbonX, an open-source tool that leverages Time
Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) for a range of decarbonization tasks. CarbonX
utilizes the versatility of TSFMs to provide strong performance across multiple
tasks, such as carbon intensity forecasting and imputation, and across diverse
grids. Using only historical carbon intensity data and a single general model,
our tool achieves a zero-shot forecasting Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)
of 15.82% across 214 grids worldwide. Across 13 benchmark grids, CarbonX
performance is comparable with the current state-of-the-art, with an average
MAPE of 9.59% and tail forecasting MAPE of 16.54%, while also providing
prediction intervals with 95% coverage. CarbonX can provide forecasts for up to
21 days with minimal accuracy degradation. Further, when fully fine-tuned,
CarbonX outperforms the statistical baselines by 1.2--3.9X on the imputation
task. Overall, these results demonstrate that CarbonX can be used easily on any
grid with limited data and still deliver strong performance, making it a
practical tool for global-scale decarbonization.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了两种改进二值化神经网络验证问题整数规划公式的技术：新的多类别线性目标函数方法和基于BNN递归结构的有效不等式生成方法，显著提升了验证效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 二值化神经网络的验证问题通常被建模为整数规划问题，但传统方法存在大M约束导致的整数间隙问题，难以高效求解。

Method: 1) 针对多类别分类问题提出新的线性目标函数构造方法；2) 利用BNN的递归结构生成有效不等式来加强整数规划公式。

Result: 实验表明，相比现有IP方法，所提技术能在有限时间内验证BNN对抗更大范围的输入扰动。

Conclusion: 通过改进整数规划公式的目标函数和约束条件，有效提升了二值化神经网络验证问题的求解效率。

Abstract: Binarized neural networks (BNNs) are feedforward neural networks with binary
weights and activation functions. In the context of using a BNN for
classification, the verification problem seeks to determine whether a small
perturbation of a given input can lead it to be misclassified by the BNN, and
the robustness of the BNN can be measured by solving the verification problem
over multiple inputs. The BNN verification problem can be formulated as an
integer programming (IP) problem. However, the natural IP formulation is often
challenging to solve due to a large integrality gap induced by big-$M$
constraints. We present two techniques to improve the IP formulation. First, we
introduce a new method for obtaining a linear objective for the multi-class
setting. Second, we introduce a new technique for generating valid inequalities
for the IP formulation that exploits the recursive structure of BNNs. We find
that our techniques enable verifying BNNs against a higher range of input
perturbation than existing IP approaches within a limited time.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Round-Trip Reinforcement Learning (RTRL)框架，通过双向转换成功率作为奖励信号来训练模型，提高大语言模型在化学任务中的双向一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有化学大语言模型缺乏双向一致性，能够完成正向任务但无法从自身生成的文本准确重建原始结构，表明模型学习的是单向记忆而非灵活掌握。

Method: RTRL框架使用双向转换成功率作为奖励信号进行强化学习训练，并提出迭代变体，让正向和反向映射交替相互训练，形成自改进循环。

Result: RTRL在监督、自监督和合成数据机制下显著提升了模型性能和一致性，优于强基线方法。

Conclusion: 双向一致性不仅是理想特性，而且是可训练目标，为构建更稳健可靠的基座模型提供了新路径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are emerging as versatile foundation models for
computational chemistry, handling bidirectional tasks like reaction prediction
and retrosynthesis. However, these models often lack round-trip consistency.
For instance, a state-of-the-art chemical LLM may successfully caption a
molecule, yet be unable to accurately reconstruct the original structure from
its own generated text. This inconsistency suggests that models are learning
unidirectional memorization rather than flexible mastery. Indeed, recent work
has demonstrated a strong correlation between a model's round-trip consistency
and its performance on the primary tasks. This strong correlation reframes
consistency into a direct target for model improvement. We therefore introduce
Round-Trip Reinforcement Learning (RTRL), a novel framework that trains a model
to improve its consistency by using the success of a round-trip transformation
as a reward signal. We further propose an iterative variant where forward and
reverse mappings alternately train each other in a self-improvement loop, a
process that is highly data-efficient and notably effective with the massive
amount of unlabelled data common in chemistry. Experiments demonstrate that
RTRL significantly \textbf{boosts performance and consistency} over strong
baselines across supervised, self-supervised, and synthetic data regimes. This
work shows that round-trip consistency is not just a desirable property but a
trainable objective, offering a new path toward more robust and reliable
foundation models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有交互式模仿学习方法只修正当前状态的动作，不调整未来可能更危险状态的动作，需要更有效利用人类干预信号。

Method: 将每次人类干预引导到未来L个时间步（偏好视野），假设智能体执行相同动作且人类进行相同干预，在这些未来状态上应用偏好优化。

Result: 在自动驾驶和机器人操作基准测试中验证了方法的效率和通用性，显著提高学习效率并减少所需的人类演示。

Conclusion: 选择合适的偏好视野L能在风险状态覆盖和标签正确性之间取得平衡，从而限制算法最优性差距。

Abstract: Learning from human involvement aims to incorporate the human subject to
monitor and correct agent behavior errors. Although most interactive imitation
learning methods focus on correcting the agent's action at the current state,
they do not adjust its actions in future states, which may be potentially more
hazardous. To address this, we introduce Predictive Preference Learning from
Human Interventions (PPL), which leverages the implicit preference signals
contained in human interventions to inform predictions of future rollouts. The
key idea of PPL is to bootstrap each human intervention into L future time
steps, called the preference horizon, with the assumption that the agent
follows the same action and the human makes the same intervention in the
preference horizon. By applying preference optimization on these future states,
expert corrections are propagated into the safety-critical regions where the
agent is expected to explore, significantly improving learning efficiency and
reducing human demonstrations needed. We evaluate our approach with experiments
on both autonomous driving and robotic manipulation benchmarks and demonstrate
its efficiency and generality. Our theoretical analysis further shows that
selecting an appropriate preference horizon L balances coverage of risky states
with label correctness, thereby bounding the algorithmic optimality gap. Demo

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的攻击方法，能够绕过大型语言模型的提示防护机制，成功越狱Google Gemini、DeepSeek Chat、Grok和Mistral Le Chat等生产模型，揭示了轻量级提示防护的固有安全漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型的发展，AI安全和对齐变得至关重要。提示防护是一种流行的轻量级防护机制，但本研究旨在揭示其局限性，展示如何绕过这些防护措施。

Method: 利用提示防护机制与主模型之间的资源不对称性，编码一个轻量级防护无法解码但主模型能够解码的越狱提示，从而绕过防护。

Result: 该方法能够持续越狱生产模型，包括Google Gemini、DeepSeek Chat、Grok和Mistral Le Chat等高度保护的聊天接口，同时保持响应质量。

Conclusion: 揭示了轻量级提示防护在现代LLM架构中的固有攻击面，强调需要将防御重点从阻止恶意输入转向防止恶意输出，并识别了其他关键对齐问题如版权数据提取、训练数据提取和思维过程中的恶意响应泄露。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) advance, ensuring AI safety and alignment is
paramount. One popular approach is prompt guards, lightweight mechanisms
designed to filter malicious queries while being easy to implement and update.
In this work, we introduce a new attack that circumvents such prompt guards,
highlighting their limitations. Our method consistently jailbreaks production
models while maintaining response quality, even under the highly protected chat
interfaces of Google Gemini (2.5 Flash/Pro), DeepSeek Chat (DeepThink), Grok
(3), and Mistral Le Chat (Magistral). The attack exploits a resource asymmetry
between the prompt guard and the main LLM, encoding a jailbreak prompt that
lightweight guards cannot decode but the main model can. This reveals an attack
surface inherent to lightweight prompt guards in modern LLM architectures and
underscores the need to shift defenses from blocking malicious inputs to
preventing malicious outputs. We additionally identify other critical alignment
issues, such as copyrighted data extraction, training data extraction, and
malicious response leakage during thinking.

Conclusion: 该框架为在下一代蜂窝系统中可扩展地集成AI/ML模型奠定了基础，对实现原生智能6G网络愿景至关重要。

Abstract: 6G brings a paradigm shift towards AI-native wireless systems, necessitating
the seamless integration of digital signal processing (DSP) and machine
learning (ML) within the software stacks of cellular networks. This
transformation brings the life cycle of modern networks closer to AI systems,
where models and algorithms are iteratively trained, simulated, and deployed
across adjacent environments. In this work, we propose a robust framework that
compiles Python-based algorithms into GPU-runnable blobs. The result is a
unified approach that ensures efficiency, flexibility, and the highest possible
performance on NVIDIA GPUs. As an example of the capabilities of the framework,
we demonstrate the efficacy of performing the channel estimation function in
the PUSCH receiver through a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained in
Python. This is done in a digital twin first, and subsequently in a real-time
testbed. Our proposed methodology, realized in the NVIDIA AI Aerial platform,
lays the foundation for scalable integration of AI/ML models into
next-generation cellular systems, and is essential for realizing the vision of
natively intelligent 6G networks.

TL;DR: TSci是首个基于LLM的智能代理框架，用于通用时间序列预测，通过四个专门代理（数据管理、规划、预测、报告）实现自动化预测流程，显著降低预测误差并提高透明度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统时间序列预测面临数据预处理、验证和集成的高昂人工成本，现有模型泛化能力差，急需一个通用的、领域无关的自动化框架来减少人工干预。

Method: TSci框架包含四个专门代理：Curator进行LLM引导的数据诊断和预处理；Planner通过多模态诊断缩小模型选择空间；Forecaster进行模型拟合、验证和自适应集成；Reporter生成全面透明的报告。

Result: 在八个基准测试中，TSci持续优于统计和LLM基线方法，分别平均降低预测误差10.4%和38.2%，同时生成清晰严谨的报告。

Conclusion: TSci将预测工作流转变为可解释、可扩展的白盒系统，显著提升了预测性能和透明度，为通用时间序列预测提供了有效的自动化解决方案。

Abstract: Time series forecasting is central to decision-making in domains as diverse
as energy, finance, climate, and public health. In practice, forecasters face
thousands of short, noisy series that vary in frequency, quality, and horizon,
where the dominant cost lies not in model fitting, but in the labor-intensive
preprocessing, validation, and ensembling required to obtain reliable
predictions. Prevailing statistical and deep learning models are tailored to
specific datasets or domains and generalize poorly. A general, domain-agnostic
framework that minimizes human intervention is urgently in demand. In this
paper, we introduce TimeSeriesScientist (TSci), the first LLM-driven agentic
framework for general time series forecasting. The framework comprises four
specialized agents: Curator performs LLM-guided diagnostics augmented by
external tools that reason over data statistics to choose targeted
preprocessing; Planner narrows the hypothesis space of model choice by
leveraging multi-modal diagnostics and self-planning over the input; Forecaster
performs model fitting and validation and, based on the results, adaptively
selects the best model configuration as well as ensemble strategy to make final
predictions; and Reporter synthesizes the whole process into a comprehensive,
transparent report. With transparent natural-language rationales and
comprehensive reports, TSci transforms the forecasting workflow into a
white-box system that is both interpretable and extensible across tasks.
Empirical results on eight established benchmarks demonstrate that TSci
consistently outperforms both statistical and LLM-based baselines, reducing
forecast error by an average of 10.4% and 38.2%, respectively. Moreover, TSci
produces a clear and rigorous report that makes the forecasting workflow more
transparent and interpretable.

TL;DR: 提出了可执行反事实框架，通过代码和数学问题评估LLM的反事实推理能力，发现从干预推理到反事实推理准确率下降25-40%，强化学习相比监督微调能更好地提升泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估LLM反事实推理能力的方法往往跳过溯因步骤，导致高估性能。需要开发能完整评估三个推理步骤（溯因、干预、预测）的框架。

Method: 引入可执行反事实框架，通过代码和数学问题操作化因果推理，要求完整执行三个推理步骤，并创建可扩展的合成数据。

Result: SOTA模型从干预推理到反事实推理准确率下降25-40%。监督微调提升域内性能但降低OOD任务准确率，而强化学习在代码和数学问题上均获得1.5-2倍提升。

Conclusion: 强化学习能诱导核心认知行为并泛化到新领域，在提升LLM反事实推理能力方面比监督微调更有前景。

Abstract: Counterfactual reasoning, a hallmark of intelligence, consists of three
steps: inferring latent variables from observations (abduction), constructing
alternatives (interventions), and predicting their outcomes (prediction). This
skill is essential for advancing LLMs' causal understanding and expanding their
applications in high-stakes domains such as scientific research. However,
existing efforts in assessing LLM's counterfactual reasoning capabilities tend
to skip the abduction step, effectively reducing to interventional reasoning
and leading to overestimation of LLM performance. To address this, we introduce
executable counterfactuals, a novel framework that operationalizes causal
reasoning through code and math problems. Our framework explicitly requires all
three steps of counterfactual reasoning and enables scalable synthetic data
creation with varying difficulty, creating a frontier for evaluating and
improving LLM's reasoning. Our results reveal substantial drop in accuracy
(25-40%) from interventional to counterfactual reasoning for SOTA models like
o4-mini and Claude-4-Sonnet. To address this gap, we construct a training set
comprising counterfactual code problems having if-else condition and test on
out-of-domain code structures (e.g. having while-loop); we also test whether a
model trained on code would generalize to counterfactual math word problems.
While supervised finetuning on stronger models' reasoning traces improves
in-domain performance of Qwen models, it leads to a decrease in accuracy on OOD
tasks such as counterfactual math problems. In contrast, reinforcement learning
induces the core cognitive behaviors and generalizes to new domains, yielding
gains over the base model on both code (improvement of 1.5x-2x) and math
problems. Analysis of the reasoning traces reinforces these findings and
highlights the promise of RL for improving LLMs' counterfactual reasoning.

TL;DR: MIRA是一种无需训练、推理时对齐的方法，通过图像空间KL正则化防止奖励黑客攻击，在保持提示一致性的同时提升奖励分数


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型生成的图像虽然符合文本提示，但往往无法满足用户特定的标量奖励标准（如美学评分）。现有的推理时对齐方法存在奖励黑客问题，即模型生成高评分但偏离原始提示的图像

Method: 提出MIRA方法，引入基于分数的图像空间KL代理，在冻结骨干网络的情况下对采样轨迹进行正则化，约束输出分布以防止奖励黑客攻击。还提出了MIRA-DPO，将偏好优化映射到推理时间

Result: 在SDv1.5和SDXL上，针对多种奖励（美学评分、HPSv2、PickScore）和公共数据集，MIRA相比强基线获得超过60%的胜率，同时保持提示一致性。机制图显示奖励增益接近零漂移

Conclusion: MIRA是一种有效的推理时对齐方法，能够在不进行微调的情况下提升扩散模型的奖励分数，同时防止奖励黑客攻击，保持生成图像与提示的一致性

Abstract: Diffusion models excel at generating images conditioned on text prompts, but
the resulting images often do not satisfy user-specific criteria measured by
scalar rewards such as Aesthetic Scores. This alignment typically requires
fine-tuning, which is computationally demanding. Recently, inference-time
alignment via noise optimization has emerged as an efficient alternative,
modifying initial input noise to steer the diffusion denoising process towards
generating high-reward images. However, this approach suffers from reward
hacking, where the model produces images that score highly, yet deviate
significantly from the original prompt. We show that noise-space regularization
is insufficient and that preventing reward hacking requires an explicit
image-space constraint. To this end, we propose MIRA (MItigating Reward
hAcking), a training-free, inference-time alignment method. MIRA introduces an
image-space, score-based KL surrogate that regularizes the sampling trajectory
with a frozen backbone, constraining the output distribution so reward can
increase without off-distribution drift (reward hacking). We derive a tractable
approximation to KL using diffusion scores. Across SDv1.5 and SDXL, multiple
rewards (Aesthetic, HPSv2, PickScore), and public datasets (e.g.,
Animal-Animal, HPDv2), MIRA achieves >60\% win rate vs. strong baselines while
preserving prompt adherence; mechanism plots show reward gains with near-zero
drift, whereas DNO drifts as compute increases. We further introduce MIRA-DPO,
mapping preference optimization to inference time with a frozen backbone,
extending MIRA to non-differentiable rewards without fine-tuning.

TL;DR: 本文分析了RLHF中KL散度正则化的不同实现方式，建立了统一框架证明'k1 in reward'是Reverse KL正则化的理论正确实现，揭示了'k2 as loss'在on-policy条件下与'k1 in reward'梯度等价，而'k3 as loss'只是一阶有偏近似。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLHF方法中KL正则化的实现存在混淆，有些方法基于数值估计原则而忽略了其作为优化损失的功能作用，需要建立统一框架来分析不同实现方式的理论基础。

Method: 建立统一框架连接两种实现风格：将数学项kn作为策略得分函数的分离系数（'kn in reward'）或作为直接损失函数（'kn as loss'），证明后者可以通过前者的等效梯度系数来分析。

Result: 证明了'k1 in reward'是Reverse KL正则化的理论正确实现；在on-policy条件下'k2 as loss'与'k1 in reward'梯度等价；'k3 as loss'只是一阶有偏近似；off-policy实现存在偏差并提出了修正方法。

Conclusion: 为KL正则化的选择和正确实现提供了全面的梯度理论基础，有助于构建更稳健有效的RLHF系统。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) leverages a
Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence loss to stabilize training and prevent
overfitting. However, in methods such as GRPO, its implementation may be guided
by principles from numerical value estimation-a practice that overlooks the
term's functional role as an optimization loss. To analyze this issue, we
establish a unified framework that connects two seemingly distinct
implementation styles: using the mathematical term $k_n$ as a detached
coefficient for the policy's score function ('$k_n$ in reward') or as a direct
loss function through which gradients are propagated ('$k_n$ as loss'). We show
that the latter can always be analyzed via an equivalent gradient coefficient
in the former, unifying the two perspectives. Through this framework, we prove
that the conventional '$k_1$ in reward' (like in PPO) is the principled loss
for Reverse KL (RKL) regularization. We further establish a key finding: under
on-policy conditions, the '$k_2$ as loss' formulation is, in fact,
gradient-equivalent to '$k_1$ in reward'. This equivalence, first proven in our
work, identifies both as the theoretically sound implementations of the RKL
objective. In contrast, we show that the recently adopted '$k_3$ as loss' (like
in GRPO) is merely a first-order, biased approximation of the principled loss.
Furthermore, we argue that common off-policy implementations of '$k_n$ as loss'
methods are biased due to neglected importance sampling, and we propose a
principled correction. Our findings provide a comprehensive, gradient-based
rationale for choosing and correctly implementing KL regularization, paving the
way for more robust and effective RLHF systems.

Conclusion: IBCD框架能够有效利用干预数据进行因果发现，提供不确定性量化，在大规模生物数据上表现优异。

Abstract: Inferring the causal relationships among a set of variables in the form of a
directed acyclic graph (DAG) is an important but notoriously challenging
problem. Recently, advancements in high-throughput genomic perturbation screens
have inspired development of methods that leverage interventional data to
improve model identification. However, existing methods still suffer poor
performance on large-scale tasks and fail to quantify uncertainty. Here, we
propose Interventional Bayesian Causal Discovery (IBCD), an empirical Bayesian
framework for causal discovery with interventional data. Our approach models
the likelihood of the matrix of total causal effects, which can be approximated
by a matrix normal distribution, rather than the full data matrix. We place a
spike-and-slab horseshoe prior on the edges and separately learn data-driven
weights for scale-free and Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi structures from observational
data, treating each edge as a latent variable to enable uncertainty-aware
inference. Through extensive simulation, we show that IBCD achieves superior
structure recovery compared to existing baselines. We apply IBCD to CRISPR
perturbation (Perturb-seq) data on 521 genes, demonstrating that edge posterior
inclusion probabilities enable identification of robust graph structures.

Motivation: 现有DiT服务系统使用固定并行度，无法有效处理异构工作负载（混合分辨率和截止时间），导致GPU利用率低和SLO达成率差。

Method: 提出步骤级序列并行策略，动态调整单个请求的并行度；设计基于轮次的调度机制，包括时间离散化、步骤级并行度适配和请求联合打包。

Result: 在先进DiT模型上的评估显示，TetriServe相比现有解决方案SLO达成率提升高达32%，且不降低图像质量。

Conclusion: TetriServe通过动态并行调度有效解决了DiT模型在严格SLO约束下的服务效率问题，显著提升了系统性能。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformer (DiT) models excel at generating highquality images
through iterative denoising steps, but serving them under strict Service Level
Objectives (SLOs) is challenging due to their high computational cost,
particularly at large resolutions. Existing serving systems use fixed degree
sequence parallelism, which is inefficient for heterogeneous workloads with
mixed resolutions and deadlines, leading to poor GPU utilization and low SLO
attainment.
  In this paper, we propose step-level sequence parallelism to dynamically
adjust the parallel degree of individual requests according to their deadlines.
We present TetriServe, a DiT serving system that implements this strategy for
highly efficient image generation. Specifically, TetriServe introduces a novel
round-based scheduling mechanism that improves SLO attainment: (1) discretizing
time into fixed rounds to make deadline-aware scheduling tractable, (2)
adapting parallelism at the step level and minimize GPU hour consumption, and
(3) jointly packing requests to minimize late completions. Extensive evaluation
on state-of-the-art DiT models shows that TetriServe achieves up to 32% higher
SLO attainment compared to existing solutions without degrading image quality.

Motivation: 探索强化学习是否能推动蛋白质语言模型超越其预训练先验，发现潜在的序列-结构-功能规则，并评估RL在蛋白质设计中的实际价值。

Method: 在四个蛋白质设计领域（抗菌肽设计、激酶变体优化、抗体工程和逆折叠）中，将多种RL算法与不同类别的PLM模型配对，比较RL与监督学习的表现差异。

Result: RL在所有基准测试中都一致提高了成功率和采样效率。性能提升遵循三因素交互作用：任务空间、奖励保真度和策略容量共同决定增益大小。当奖励准确、策略容量充足且任务有改进空间时，改进显著；当奖励噪声大或容量受限时，增益饱和。

Conclusion: 为蛋白质设计中的RL应用提供了实用指导：优先考虑奖励建模和校准，再扩展策略规模；根据任务难度匹配算法和正则化强度；在边际收益最大的地方分配容量。

Abstract: Protein language models (PLMs) have advanced computational protein science
through large-scale pretraining and scalable architectures. In parallel,
reinforcement learning (RL) has broadened exploration and enabled precise
multi-objective optimization in protein design. Yet whether RL can push PLMs
beyond their pretraining priors to uncover latent sequence-structure-function
rules remains unclear. We address this by pairing RL with PLMs across four
domains: antimicrobial peptide design, kinase variant optimization, antibody
engineering, and inverse folding. Using diverse RL algorithms and model
classes, we ask if RL improves sampling efficiency and, more importantly, if it
reveals capabilities not captured by supervised learning. Across benchmarks, RL
consistently boosts success rates and sample efficiency. Performance follows a
three-factor interaction: task headroom, reward fidelity, and policy capacity
jointly determine gains. When rewards are accurate and informative, policies
have sufficient capacity, and tasks leave room beyond supervised baselines,
improvements scale; when rewards are noisy or capacity is constrained, gains
saturate despite exploration. This view yields practical guidance for RL in
protein design: prioritize reward modeling and calibration before scaling
policy size, match algorithm and regularization strength to task difficulty,
and allocate capacity where marginal gains are largest. Implementation is
available at https://github.com/chq1155/RL-PLM.

Motivation: 传统梯度裁剪使用固定的硬阈值，缺乏灵活性且忽略了梯度分布动态。

Method: SPAMP跟踪局部梯度统计，动态估计阈值，并应用基于功率的变换来以可微分方式调制更新幅度。

Result: 在图像和语言任务上的广泛实验表明，SPAMP在稳定性、收敛性和鲁棒性方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SPAMP为控制有效更新尺度提供了原则性替代方案，将裁剪和预热重新表述为双重机制。

Abstract: Gradient clipping is widely used to stabilize deep network training, but its
formulation as a hard, fixed threshold limits flexibility and ignores gradient
distribution dynamics. We propose SPAMP (Statistical Per-layer Adaptive
Modulation and Projection), a unified framework that generalizes clipping into
smooth, per-layer gradient shaping. SPAMP tracks local gradient statistics,
dynamically estimates thresholds, and applies power-based transformations to
modulate update magnitudes in a differentiable manner. This perspective recasts
clipping and warmup as dual mechanisms for controlling the effective update
scale $\eta_t \|g_t\|$, offering a principled alternative to rigid heuristics.
Extensive experiments across image and language tasks demonstrate that SPAMP
improves stability, convergence, and robustness over existing methods.

TL;DR: TRAAC是一种在线后训练强化学习方法，通过自适应压缩推理步骤来解决模型在复杂推理任务中的欠适应性问题，平衡推理不足和过度推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有思维模型通过扩展测试时计算来解决复杂推理任务，但需要根据任务难度合理分配计算资源。推理过短会导致困难问题出错，推理过长则效率低下。

Method: 提出TRAAC方法，利用模型在长推理轨迹上的自注意力来识别重要步骤并剪枝冗余步骤，同时估计难度并将其纳入训练奖励，学习根据示例难度分配推理预算。

Result: 在多种任务上，TRAAC相比基础模型平均准确率提升8.4%，推理长度相对减少36.8%；相比最佳RL基线准确率提升7.9%，长度减少29.4%。

Conclusion: TRAAC能够基于难度进行细粒度推理预算调整，结合任务难度校准和基于注意力的压缩方法，在多样化任务上均能获得收益。

Abstract: Recent thinking models solve complex reasoning tasks by scaling test-time
compute, but this scaling must be allocated in line with task difficulty. On
one hand, short reasoning (underthinking) leads to errors on harder problems
that require extended reasoning steps; but, excessively long reasoning
(overthinking) can be token-inefficient, generating unnecessary steps even
after reaching a correct intermediate solution. We refer to this as
under-adaptivity, where the model fails to modulate its response length
appropriately given problems of varying difficulty. To address under-adaptivity
and strike a balance between under- and overthinking, we propose TRAAC (Think
Right with Adaptive, Attentive Compression), an online post-training RL method
that leverages the model's self-attention over a long reasoning trajectory to
identify important steps and prune redundant ones. TRAAC also estimates
difficulty and incorporates it into training rewards, thereby learning to
allocate reasoning budget commensurate with example difficulty. Our approach
improves accuracy, reduces reasoning steps, and enables adaptive thinking
compared to base models and other RL baselines. Across a variety of tasks
(AIME, AMC, GPQA-D, BBEH), TRAAC (Qwen3-4B) achieves an average absolute
accuracy gain of 8.4% with a relative reduction in reasoning length of 36.8%
compared to the base model, and a 7.9% accuracy gain paired with a 29.4% length
drop compared to the best RL baseline. TRAAC also shows strong generalization:
although our models are trained on math datasets, they show accuracy and
efficiency gains on out-of-distribution non-math datasets like GPQA-D, BBEH,
and OptimalThinkingBench. Our analysis further verifies that TRAAC provides
fine-grained adjustments to thinking budget based on difficulty and that a
combination of task-difficulty calibration and attention-based compression
yields gains across diverse tasks.

TL;DR: 提出了NoRo框架，用于增强帕金森病远程监测中UPDRS评分预测的噪声鲁棒性，通过对比学习生成噪声鲁棒特征，并在多种噪声环境下验证了有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 帕金森病远程监测中存在三种噪声：患者测量不准确、环境噪声和数据传输丢包，导致UPDRS评分预测误差增加，需要提高预测模型的噪声鲁棒性。

Method: 首先将语音特征按选定特征的连续值分组成有序区间构建对比对；然后使用对比对训练多层感知机编码器生成噪声鲁棒特征；最后将这些特征与原始特征拼接作为增强特征输入UPDRS预测模型。

Result: 通过自定义噪声注入模块进行广泛实验，证明NoRo能够成功增强各种下游预测模型在不同噪声环境下的UPDRS预测鲁棒性。

Conclusion: NoRo框架有效解决了帕金森病远程监测中的噪声问题，显著提升了UPDRS评分预测的准确性和可靠性。

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative
disorder. PD telemonitoring emerges as a novel assessment modality enabling
self-administered at-home tests of Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale
(UPDRS) scores, enhancing accessibility for PD patients. However, three types
of noise would occur during measurements: (1) patient-induced measurement
inaccuracies, (2) environmental noise, and (3) data packet loss during
transmission, resulting in higher prediction errors. To address these
challenges, NoRo, a noise-robust UPDRS prediction framework is proposed. First,
the original speech features are grouped into ordered bins, based on the
continuous values of a selected feature, to construct contrastive pairs.
Second, the contrastive pairs are employed to train a multilayer perceptron
encoder for generating noise-robust features. Finally, these features are
concatenated with the original features as the augmented features, which are
then fed into the UPDRS prediction models. Notably, we further introduces a
novel evaluation approach with customizable noise injection module, and
extensive experiments show that NoRo can successfully enhance the noise
robustness of UPDRS prediction across various downstream prediction models
under different noisy environments.

Motivation: 传统伪随机数生成器(PRNGs)在生成式AI中产生可预测模式，易受攻击者利用，且现有防御方案能耗和延迟开销大。

Method: 通过STT-MTJs硬件生成真随机比特，构建高度并行的FPGA辅助计算系统，并将硬件随机数集成到GAN中。

Result: 系统提供兆比特/秒的真随机数，通过NIST随机性测试；在CIFAR-10训练的GAN中，相比低质量RNG基线，不安全输出减少高达18.6倍。

Conclusion: STT-MTJ系统具有纳秒级切换速度、高能效和可扩展性，有望扩展到10^6个并行单元，实现千兆比特/秒吞吐量，适合大型语言模型采样。

Abstract: Deterministic pseudo random number generators (PRNGs) used in generative
artificial intelligence (GAI) models produce predictable patterns vulnerable to
exploitation by attackers. Conventional defences against the vulnerabilities
often come with significant energy and latency overhead. Here, we embed
hardware-generated true random bits from spin-transfer torque magnetic tunnel
junctions (STT-MTJs) to address the challenges. A highly parallel,
FPGA-assisted prototype computing system delivers megabit-per-second true
random numbers, passing NIST randomness tests after in-situ operations with
minimal overhead. Integrating the hardware random bits into a generative
adversarial network (GAN) trained on CIFAR-10 reduces insecure outputs by up to
18.6 times compared to the low-quality random number generators (RNG) baseline.
With nanosecond switching speed, high energy efficiency, and established
scalability, our STT-MTJ-based system holds the potential to scale beyond 106
parallel cells, achieving gigabit-per-second throughput suitable for large
language model sampling. This advancement highlights spintronic RNGs as
practical security components for next-generation GAI systems.

Motivation: 深入理解变分自编码器中后验坍塌现象的本质，揭示其不仅是优化失败，而是数据结构和变分约束相互作用产生的相变过程。

Method: 通过分析后验坍塌相关平凡解的稳定性，识别临界超参数阈值，并在合成和真实数据集上验证临界行为。

Result: 发现了KL散度在临界边界处的不连续性，确认了相变的存在，临界边界将有意义潜在推断与坍塌状态分开。

Conclusion: 后验坍塌是一种涌现的相变现象，这一视角为深度生成模型的可训练性和表示能力提供了新的见解。

Abstract: We investigate the phenomenon of posterior collapse in variational
autoencoders (VAEs) from the perspective of statistical physics, and reveal
that it constitutes a phase transition governed jointly by data structure and
model hyper-parameters. By analyzing the stability of the trivial solution
associated with posterior collapse, we identify a critical hyper-parameter
threshold. This critical boundary, separating meaningful latent inference from
collapse, is characterized by a discontinuity in the KL divergence between the
approximate posterior and the prior distribution. We validate this critical
behavior on both synthetic and real-world datasets, confirming the existence of
a phase transition. Our results demonstrate that posterior collapse is not
merely an optimization failure, but rather an emerging phase transition arising
from the interplay between data structure and variational constraints. This
perspective offers new insights into the trainability and representational
capacity of deep generative models.

TL;DR: 研究发现SFT分数不能可靠预测RL训练后的性能提升，甚至可能产生负面影响。提出了泛化损失和Pass@large k作为更有效的RL结果预测指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战当前两阶段训练范式（SFT+RL）的假设，即高SFT分数能转化为RL后的性能提升。通过实验发现这种关联并不成立。

Method: 训练数百个12B参数模型，使用SFT和RLVR（GRPO方法），在7个数学基准测试上进行多达256次重复评估，消耗超过100万GPU小时。

Result: 基于泛化损失和Pass@large k的预测比直接使用SFT分数更准确，R²系数和Spearman秩相关系数提升高达0.5（2倍）。

Conclusion: SFT分数不是RL结果的可靠预测指标，泛化损失和Pass@large k提供了更好的预测能力，对实际应用有重要价值。

Abstract: In post-training for reasoning Large Language Models (LLMs), the current
state of practice trains LLMs in two independent stages: Supervised Fine-Tuning
(SFT) and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR, shortened as
``RL'' below). In this work, we challenge whether high SFT scores translate to
improved performance after RL. We provide extensive counter-examples where this
is not true. We find high SFT scores can be biased toward simpler or more
homogeneous data and are not reliably predictive of subsequent RL gains or
scaled-up post-training effectiveness. In some cases, RL training on models
with improved SFT performance could lead to substantially worse outcome
compared to RL on the base model without SFT. We study alternative metrics and
identify generalization loss on held-out reasoning examples and Pass@large k
performance to provide strong proxies for the RL outcome. We trained hundreds
of models up to 12B-parameter with SFT and RLVR via GRPO and ran extensive
evaluations on 7 math benchmarks with up to 256 repetitions, spending $>$1M GPU
hours. Experiments include models from Llama3, Mistral-Nemo, Qwen3 and multiple
state-of-the-art SFT/RL datasets. Compared to directly predicting from pre-RL
performance, prediction based on generalization loss and Pass@large k achieves
substantial higher precision, improving $R^2$ coefficient and Spearman's rank
correlation coefficient by up to 0.5 (2x). This provides strong utility for
broad use cases. For example, in most experiments, we find SFT training on
unique examples for a one epoch underperforms training on half examples for two
epochs, either after SFT or SFT-then-RL; With the same SFT budget, training
only on short examples may lead to better SFT performance, though, it often
leads to worse outcome after RL compared to training on examples with varying
lengths. Evaluation tool will be open-sourced.

Motivation: 高质量训练数据有限，合成数据技术可能突破这一限制，但需要实证验证其有效性。

Method: 使用统一协议和缩放定律，在1000多个LLM上进行大规模实验，比较自然网络数据、各种合成数据及其混合。

Result: 改写合成数据单独使用效果不如自然文本，但与自然文本混合可显著加速训练；教科书式合成数据单独使用效果较差；最佳合成数据比例约30%。

Conclusion: 合成数据在预训练中具有条件性益处，混合使用可显著提升效率，但需谨慎选择合成数据类型和比例。

Abstract: Training data plays a crucial role in Large Language Models (LLM) scaling,
yet high quality data is of limited supply. Synthetic data techniques offer a
potential path toward sidestepping these limitations. We conduct a large-scale
empirical investigation (>1000 LLMs with >100k GPU hours) using a unified
protocol and scaling laws, comparing natural web data, diverse synthetic types
(rephrased text, generated textbooks), and mixtures of natural and synthetic
data. Specifically, we found pre-training on rephrased synthetic data
\textit{alone} is not faster than pre-training on natural web texts; while
pre-training on 1/3 rephrased synthetic data mixed with 2/3 natural web texts
can speed up 5-10x (to reach the same validation loss) at larger data budgets.
Pre-training on textbook-style synthetic data \textit{alone} results in notably
higher loss on many downstream domains especially at small data budgets. "Good"
ratios of synthetic data in training data mixtures depend on the model size and
data budget, empirically converging to ~30% for rephrased synthetic data.
Larger generator models do not necessarily yield better pre-training data than
~8B-param models. These results contribute mixed evidence on "model collapse"
during large-scale single-round (n=1) model training on synthetic
data--training on rephrased synthetic data shows no degradation in performance
in foreseeable scales whereas training on mixtures of textbook-style
pure-generated synthetic data shows patterns predicted by "model collapse". Our
work demystifies synthetic data in pre-training, validates its conditional
benefits, and offers practical guidance.

TL;DR: 提出曲率自适应Transformer（CAT），通过可学习的门控机制动态路由token到不同几何空间的注意力分支，解决了传统Transformer在非欧几里得数据上的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Transformer假设欧几里得几何，限制了在非欧几里得结构数据上的有效性。现有方法需要预先选择单一几何空间，缺乏对混合几何特性的灵活性。

Method: 使用轻量级可微分门控机制，动态学习每个token在三个几何注意力分支之间的路由。每个分支采用针对各自流形优化的几何特定操作。

Result: 在知识图谱补全基准（FB15k-237, WN18RR）上，MRR和Hits@10指标比固定几何基线提升约10%，参数仅增加5%，推理时间相当。

Conclusion: 学习的几何自适应优于任何单一固定几何，CAT为跨语言、视觉和多模态领域的混合几何架构提供了可扩展和可解释的基础。

Abstract: Transformers achieve strong performance across diverse domains but implicitly
assume Euclidean geometry in their attention mechanisms, limiting their
effectiveness on data with non-Euclidean structure. While recent extensions to
hyperbolic and spherical spaces show promise for hierarchical and cyclical
patterns, respectively, they require committing to a single geometry a priori,
reducing flexibility when data exhibits mixed geometric properties. We
introduce the Curvature-Adaptive Transformer (CAT), a novel architecture that
dynamically learns per-token routing across three geometric attention branches
through a lightweight, differentiable gating mechanism. Unlike fixed-geometry
approaches, CAT enables adaptive geometric specialization, routing tokens to
the appropriate curvature based on their local relational structure. The
routing network provides interpretable curvature preferences while each branch
employs geometry-specific operations optimized for its respective manifold. On
knowledge graph completion benchmarks (FB15k-237, WN18RR), CAT achieves
approximately 10% improvements in MRR and Hits@10 over fixed-geometry baselines
with minimal overhead (5% parameter increase, comparable inference time). These
results demonstrate that learned geometric adaptation outperforms any single
fixed geometry for complex relational reasoning, establishing CAT as a scalable
and interpretable foundation for mixture-of-geometry architectures across
language, vision, and multimodal domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在现实场景中，LLM生成的内容可能经过后生成编辑（如人工修订或欺骗攻击），因此需要检测和定位这些修改。

Method: 将词汇表划分为不相交子集，通过在这些子集上强制执行确定性组合模式来嵌入水印，并设计轻量级局部统计量来标记和定位潜在编辑。

Result: 在开源LLM上评估，在各种编辑场景下展示了强大的编辑定位性能。

Conclusion: 提出的组合水印框架能够有效检测和定位水印LLM输出中的后生成编辑。

Abstract: Watermarking has become a key technique for proprietary language models,
enabling the distinction between AI-generated and human-written text. However,
in many real-world scenarios, LLM-generated content may undergo post-generation
edits, such as human revisions or even spoofing attacks, making it critical to
detect and localize such modifications. In this work, we introduce a new task:
detecting post-generation edits locally made to watermarked LLM outputs. To
this end, we propose a combinatorial pattern-based watermarking framework,
which partitions the vocabulary into disjoint subsets and embeds the watermark
by enforcing a deterministic combinatorial pattern over these subsets during
generation. We accompany the combinatorial watermark with a global statistic
that can be used to detect the watermark. Furthermore, we design lightweight
local statistics to flag and localize potential edits. We introduce two
task-specific evaluation metrics, Type-I error rate and detection accuracy, and
evaluate our method on open-source LLMs across a variety of editing scenarios,
demonstrating strong empirical performance in edit localization.

Motivation: 现有次二次注意力近似算法需要限制性有界条目假设，这在现代大语言模型中很少成立，限制了其实际应用。

Method: 利用查询和键矩阵的子高斯特性，将大条目和小条目分离，稀疏部分精确计算，稠密部分使用多项式逼近，并扩展到多阈值设置消除分布假设。

Result: 实现了次二次运行时间，为多项式注意力的经验成功提供了理论依据，证明softmax注意力可以通过带草图的多项式注意力组合来近似。

Conclusion: 支持基分解框架突破了有界条目限制，为高效注意力近似提供了新方法，具有理论和实践意义。

Abstract: The quadratic complexity of softmax attention remains a central bottleneck in
scaling large language models (LLMs). [Alman and Song, NeurIPS 2023] proposed a
sub-quadratic attention approximation algorithm, but it works only under the
restrictive bounded-entry assumption. Since this assumption rarely holds in
practice, its applicability to modern LLMs is limited.
  In this paper, we introduce support-basis decomposition, a new framework for
efficient attention approximation beyond bounded entries. We empirically
demonstrate that the entries of the query and key matrices exhibit sub-Gaussian
behavior. Our approach uses this property to split large and small entries,
enabling exact computation on sparse components and polynomial approximation on
dense components. We establish rigorous theoretical guarantees, proving a
sub-quadratic runtime, and extend the method to a multi-threshold setting that
eliminates all distributional assumptions. Furthermore, we provide the first
theoretical justification for the empirical success of polynomial attention
[Kacham, Mirrokni, and Zhong, ICML 2024], showing that softmax attention can be
closely approximated by a combination of multiple polynomial attentions with
sketching.

Result: 在数值研究中，该方法显著超越了需要访问源域样本的现有方法。

Conclusion: REFEREE方法成功解决了无需源域样本的跨域持续学习问题，在性能上优于现有方法。

Abstract: Although existing cross-domain continual learning approaches successfully
address many streaming tasks having domain shifts, they call for a fully
labeled source domain hindering their feasibility in the privacy constrained
environments. This paper goes one step ahead with the problem of source-free
cross-domain continual learning where the use of source-domain samples are
completely prohibited. We propose the idea of rehearsal-free frequency-aware
dynamic prompt collaborations (REFEREE) to cope with the absence of labeled
source-domain samples in realm of cross-domain continual learning. REFEREE is
built upon a synergy between a source-pre-trained model and a large-scale
vision-language model, thus overcoming the problem of sub-optimal
generalizations when relying only on a source pre-trained model. The domain
shift problem between the source domain and the target domain is handled by a
frequency-aware prompting technique encouraging low-frequency components while
suppressing high-frequency components. This strategy generates frequency-aware
augmented samples, robust against noisy pseudo labels. The noisy pseudo-label
problem is further addressed with the uncertainty-aware weighting strategy
where the mean and covariance matrix are weighted by prediction uncertainties,
thus mitigating the adverse effects of the noisy pseudo label. Besides, the
issue of catastrophic forgetting (CF) is overcome by kernel linear discriminant
analysis (KLDA) where the backbone network is frozen while the classification
is performed using the linear discriminant analysis approach guided by the
random kernel method. Our rigorous numerical studies confirm the advantage of
our approach where it beats prior arts having access to source domain samples
with significant margins.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统神经网络剪枝方法在达到中等稀疏度（50-60%）时会严重降低模型精度，无法满足大语言模型对计算和内存效率的更高要求。

Method: 使用基于ADMM的标准约束优化技术，直接解决当前方法依赖替代目标公式的局限性，并提出了量化变体Elsa-L来处理超大模型。

Result: 在多种模型和规模上的广泛实验表明，Elsa显著优于现有方法，在LLaMA-2-7B模型90%稀疏度下，困惑度比现有最佳方法低7.8倍。

Conclusion: Elsa在推进LLM稀疏度前沿方面取得了有意义的进展，表明在目前探索有限的方向上仍存在显著的进一步改进机会。

Abstract: Neural network pruning is a promising technique to mitigate the excessive
computational and memory requirements of large language models (LLMs). Despite
its promise, however, progress in this area has diminished, as conventional
methods are seemingly unable to surpass moderate sparsity levels (50-60%)
without severely degrading model accuracy. This work breaks through the current
impasse, presenting a principled and effective method called $\texttt{Elsa}$,
which achieves extreme sparsity levels of up to 90% while retaining high model
fidelity. This is done by identifying several limitations in current practice,
all of which can be traced back to their reliance on a surrogate objective
formulation. $\texttt{Elsa}$ tackles this issue directly and effectively via
standard and well-established constrained optimization techniques based on
ADMM. Our extensive experiments across a wide range of models and scales show
that $\texttt{Elsa}$ achieves substantial improvements over existing methods;
e.g., it achieves 7.8$\times$ less perplexity than the best existing method on
LLaMA-2-7B at 90% sparsity. Furthermore, we present
$\texttt{Elsa}_{\text{-L}}$, a quantized variant that scales to extremely large
models (27B), and establish its theoretical convergence guarantees. These
results highlight meaningful progress in advancing the frontier of LLM
sparsity, while promising that significant opportunities for further
advancement may remain in directions that have so far attracted limited
exploration.

TL;DR: AsyPPO是一种为大型语言模型设计的强化学习框架，通过使用轻量级mini-critics来恢复critic的作用，同时保持效率。该方法在多个基准测试中显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RL4LLM方法避免使用显式critic，因为在大模型规模下训练价值函数计算成本高，且在稀疏奖励和长推理视野下容易失败。本文从架构角度重新审视这一瓶颈。

Method: AsyPPO采用一组轻量级mini-critics，每个在不相交的提示分片上训练。利用critic间的不确定性来优化策略更新：在critic一致的状态下屏蔽优势值，从熵正则化中过滤高分歧状态。

Result: 在仅使用5,000个样本的开源数据上训练后，AsyPPO在多个基准测试中持续提升学习稳定性和性能，相比经典PPO在Qwen3-4b-Base上获得超过6%的性能提升，在Qwen3-8b-Base和Qwen3-14b-Base上获得约3%的提升。

Conclusion: 这些结果突显了架构创新对于可扩展、高效算法的重要性。

Abstract: Most recent RL for LLMs (RL4LLM) methods avoid explicit critics, replacing
them with average advantage baselines. This shift is largely pragmatic:
conventional value functions are computationally expensive to train at LLM
scale and often fail under sparse rewards and long reasoning horizons. We
revisit this bottleneck from an architectural perspective and introduce
Asymmetric Proximal Policy Optimization (AsyPPO), a simple and scalable
framework that restores the critics role while remaining efficient in
large-model settings. AsyPPO employs a set of lightweight mini-critics, each
trained on disjoint prompt shards. This design encourages diversity while
preserving calibration, reducing value-estimation bias. Beyond robust
estimation, AsyPPO leverages inter-critic uncertainty to refine the policy
update: (i) masking advantages in states where critics agree and gradients add
little learning signal, and (ii) filtering high-divergence states from entropy
regularization, suppressing spurious exploration. After training on open-source
data with only 5,000 samples, AsyPPO consistently improves learning stability
and performance across multiple benchmarks over strong baselines, such as GRPO,
achieving performance gains of more than six percent on Qwen3-4b-Base and about
three percent on Qwen3-8b-Base and Qwen3-14b-Base over classic PPO, without
additional tricks. These results highlight the importance of architectural
innovations for scalable, efficient algorithms.

Result: 在128个UCR和30个UAE数据集上分类任务表现显著优于现有方法，在Yahoo和KPI数据集上异常检测获得竞争性结果。

Conclusion: TimeHUT通过层次化均匀性-容忍度平衡有效提升了时间序列表示学习性能，特别是在分类任务上取得了显著改进。

Abstract: We propose TimeHUT, a novel method for learning time-series representations
by hierarchical uniformity-tolerance balancing of contrastive representations.
Our method uses two distinct losses to learn strong representations with the
aim of striking an effective balance between uniformity and tolerance in the
embedding space. First, TimeHUT uses a hierarchical setup to learn both
instance-wise and temporal information from input time-series. Next, we
integrate a temperature scheduler within the vanilla contrastive loss to
balance the uniformity and tolerance characteristics of the embeddings.
Additionally, a hierarchical angular margin loss enforces instance-wise and
temporal contrast losses, creating geometric margins between positive and
negative pairs of temporal sequences. This approach improves the coherence of
positive pairs and their separation from the negatives, enhancing the capture
of temporal dependencies within a time-series sample. We evaluate our approach
on a wide range of tasks, namely 128 UCR and 30 UAE datasets for univariate and
multivariate classification, as well as Yahoo and KPI datasets for anomaly
detection. The results demonstrate that TimeHUT outperforms prior methods by
considerable margins on classification, while obtaining competitive results for
anomaly detection. Finally, detailed sensitivity and ablation studies are
performed to evaluate different components and hyperparameters of our method.

*Wangxuan Fan,Ching Wang,Siqi Li,Nan Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ShapKAN是一个基于Shapley值的KAN网络剪枝框架，通过量化节点实际贡献来解决传统基于幅度的剪枝方法对输入坐标偏移敏感的问题，实现网络压缩的同时保持节点重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统神经网络虽然预测性能好但缺乏可解释性，KAN网络通过可学习的样条激活函数恢复符号表示，但其独特架构给网络剪枝带来挑战，传统基于幅度的剪枝方法因对输入坐标偏移敏感而不可靠。

Method: 提出ShapKAN剪枝框架，使用Shapley值归因来评估节点重要性，以平移不变的方式量化每个节点的实际贡献，确保重要性排名不受输入参数化影响。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的广泛实验表明，ShapKAN能够保持真实节点重要性，同时实现有效的网络压缩。

Conclusion: ShapKAN提升了KAN的可解释性优势，便于在资源受限环境中部署。

Abstract: For many real-world applications, understanding feature-outcome relationships
is as crucial as achieving high predictive accuracy. While traditional neural
networks excel at prediction, their black-box nature obscures underlying
functional relationships. Kolmogorov--Arnold Networks (KANs) address this by
employing learnable spline-based activation functions on edges, enabling
recovery of symbolic representations while maintaining competitive performance.
However, KAN's architecture presents unique challenges for network pruning.
Conventional magnitude-based methods become unreliable due to sensitivity to
input coordinate shifts. We propose \textbf{ShapKAN}, a pruning framework using
Shapley value attribution to assess node importance in a shift-invariant
manner. Unlike magnitude-based approaches, ShapKAN quantifies each node's
actual contribution, ensuring consistent importance rankings regardless of
input parameterization. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world
datasets demonstrate that ShapKAN preserves true node importance while enabling
effective network compression. Our approach improves KAN's interpretability
advantages, facilitating deployment in resource-constrained environments.

### [190] [Beyond Simple Fusion: Adaptive Gated Fusion for Robust Multimodal Sentiment Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01677)
*Han Wu,Yanming Sun,Yunhe Yang,Derek F. Wong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种自适应门控融合网络（AGFN），通过基于信息熵和模态重要性的双门融合机制，自适应调整特征权重，以解决多模态情感分析中模态质量变化（如噪声、缺失或语义冲突）导致性能下降的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的简单融合技术无法有效处理模态质量变化（如噪声、缺失或语义冲突），导致在识别细微情感时性能不佳。

Method: 采用自适应门控融合网络，通过基于信息熵和模态重要性的双门融合机制，在单模态编码和跨模态交互后自适应调整特征权重，减少噪声模态影响并优先考虑信息丰富的线索。

Result: 在CMU-MOSI和CMU-MOSEI数据集上的实验表明，AGFN在准确率上显著优于强基线方法，能够有效识别细微情感并具有鲁棒性能。可视化分析显示AGFN通过减少特征位置与预测误差之间的相关性，增强了泛化能力。

Conclusion: AGFN通过自适应门控融合机制有效提升了多模态情感分析的性能，特别是在处理模态质量变化和识别细微情感方面表现出色，同时增强了模型的泛化能力。

Abstract: Multimodal sentiment analysis (MSA) leverages information fusion from diverse
modalities (e.g., text, audio, visual) to enhance sentiment prediction.
However, simple fusion techniques often fail to account for variations in
modality quality, such as those that are noisy, missing, or semantically
conflicting. This oversight leads to suboptimal performance, especially in
discerning subtle emotional nuances. To mitigate this limitation, we introduce
a simple yet efficient \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{G}ated \textbf{F}usion
\textbf{N}etwork that adaptively adjusts feature weights via a dual gate fusion
mechanism based on information entropy and modality importance. This mechanism
mitigates the influence of noisy modalities and prioritizes informative cues
following unimodal encoding and cross-modal interaction. Experiments on
CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI show that AGFN significantly outperforms strong
baselines in accuracy, effectively discerning subtle emotions with robust
performance. Visualization analysis of feature representations demonstrates
that AGFN enhances generalization by learning from a broader feature
distribution, achieved by reducing the correlation between feature location and
prediction error, thereby decreasing reliance on specific locations and
creating more robust multimodal feature representations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于悲观原则的离线数据驱动分类优化框架PASTA，在数据覆盖不足的情况下实现最优预期收益，并在多种选择模型中建立了首个有限样本遗憾界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决分类优化问题中由于数据覆盖不足导致的挑战，企业缺乏先验选择模型知识，需要基于历史客户选择数据确定最优分类。

Method: 引入悲观分类优化(PASTA)框架，利用悲观原则，仅要求离线数据分布包含最优分类，而不需要覆盖所有可行分类。

Result: 建立了多种常用选择模型（包括多项式logit和嵌套logit模型）的有限样本遗憾界，证明了PASTA在样本和模型复杂度方面的极小极大最优性。

Conclusion: PASTA框架在离线数据驱动的分类优化中表现优异，数值实验显示其优于现有基线方法。

Abstract: We study a broad class of assortment optimization problems in an offline and
data-driven setting. In such problems, a firm lacks prior knowledge of the
underlying choice model, and aims to determine an optimal assortment based on
historical customer choice data. The combinatorial nature of assortment
optimization often results in insufficient data coverage, posing a significant
challenge in designing provably effective solutions. To address this, we
introduce a novel Pessimistic Assortment Optimization (PASTA) framework that
leverages the principle of pessimism to achieve optimal expected revenue under
general choice models. Notably, PASTA requires only that the offline data
distribution contains an optimal assortment, rather than providing the full
coverage of all feasible assortments. Theoretically, we establish the first
finite-sample regret bounds for offline assortment optimization across several
widely used choice models, including the multinomial logit and nested logit
models. Additionally, we derive a minimax regret lower bound, proving that
PASTA is minimax optimal in terms of sample and model complexity. Numerical
experiments further demonstrate that our method outperforms existing baseline
approaches.

### [192] [Representational Alignment Across Model Layers and Brain Regions with Hierarchical Optimal Transport](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01706)
*Shaan Shah,Meenakshi Khosla*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出分层最优传输（HOT）框架，通过全局优化解决神经网络表示相似性分析中的不对称、缺乏全局对齐分数和深度不匹配问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有表示相似性方法存在三个主要问题：独立对齐各层导致结果不对称、缺乏全局对齐分数、难以处理不同深度的网络。这些问题源于忽略了全局激活结构和限制了一对一的层对应关系。

Method: HOT框架联合推断软性的、全局一致的层到层耦合和神经元级传输计划，允许源神经元将质量分布到多个目标层，在边际约束下最小化总传输成本。

Result: 在视觉模型、大语言模型和人类视觉皮层记录上的评估显示，HOT在对齐质量上匹配或超越了标准成对匹配方法，并揭示了平滑、细粒度的分层对应关系。

Conclusion: HOT能够实现更丰富、更可解释的表示比较，特别是在网络架构或深度不同的情况下，通过全局优化自然产生结构化模式。

Abstract: Standard representational similarity methods align each layer of a network to
its best match in another independently, producing asymmetric results, lacking
a global alignment score, and struggling with networks of different depths.
These limitations arise from ignoring global activation structure and
restricting mappings to rigid one-to-one layer correspondences. We propose
Hierarchical Optimal Transport (HOT), a unified framework that jointly infers
soft, globally consistent layer-to-layer couplings and neuron-level transport
plans. HOT allows source neurons to distribute mass across multiple target
layers while minimizing total transport cost under marginal constraints. This
yields both a single alignment score for the entire network comparison and a
soft transport plan that naturally handles depth mismatches through mass
distribution. We evaluate HOT on vision models, large language models, and
human visual cortex recordings. Across all domains, HOT matches or surpasses
standard pairwise matching in alignment quality. Moreover, it reveals smooth,
fine-grained hierarchical correspondences: early layers map to early layers,
deeper layers maintain relative positions, and depth mismatches are resolved by
distributing representations across multiple layers. These structured patterns
emerge naturally from global optimization without being imposed, yet are absent
in greedy layer-wise methods. HOT thus enables richer, more interpretable
comparisons between representations, particularly when networks differ in
architecture or depth.

*Aidan Acquah,Shing Chan,Aiden Doherty*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ActiNet模型（自监督ResNet-V2+HMM）在手腕加速度计数据上识别活动强度，性能优于传统随机森林+HMM方法，F1分数0.82 vs 0.77，在不同年龄和性别亚组中表现一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在大规模流行病学研究中，需要可靠准确的人类活动识别模型来分析手腕加速度计数据，研究体力活动与健康结果的关系。

Method: 使用151名CAPTURE-24参与者的数据，训练ActiNet模型（18层自监督改进ResNet-V2），结合隐马尔可夫模型平滑处理，采用5折分层组交叉验证。

Result: ActiNet模型平均宏观F1分数0.82，Cohen's kappa分数0.86，显著优于RF+HMM基准模型（F1 0.77，kappa 0.81），在不同年龄和性别亚组中表现一致。

Conclusion: 研究结果支持在未来的流行病学研究中使用ActiNet模型从手腕加速度计数据中提取活动强度标签。

Abstract: The use of reliable and accurate human activity recognition (HAR) models on
passively collected wrist-accelerometer data is essential in large-scale
epidemiological studies that investigate the association between physical
activity and health outcomes. While the use of self-supervised learning has
generated considerable excitement in improving HAR, it remains unknown the
extent to which these models, coupled with hidden Markov models (HMMs), would
make a tangible improvement to classification performance, and the effect this
may have on the predicted daily activity intensity compositions. Using 151
CAPTURE-24 participants' data, we trained the ActiNet model, a self-supervised,
18-layer, modified ResNet-V2 model, followed by hidden Markov model (HMM)
smoothing to classify labels of activity intensity. The performance of this
model, evaluated using 5-fold stratified group cross-validation, was then
compared to a baseline random forest (RF) + HMM, established in existing
literature. Differences in performance and classification outputs were compared
with different subgroups of age and sex within the Capture-24 population. The
ActiNet model was able to distinguish labels of activity intensity with a mean
macro F1 score of 0.82, and mean Cohen's kappa score of 0.86. This exceeded the
performance of the RF + HMM, trained and validated on the same dataset, with
mean scores of 0.77 and 0.81, respectively. These findings were consistent
across subgroups of age and sex. These findings encourage the use of ActiNet
for the extraction of activity intensity labels from wrist-accelerometer data
in future epidemiological studies.

Conclusion: 无人机辅助的联邦多模态学习框架能有效降低系统延迟并提高模型性能，为实际应用提供了理论保证和高效解决方案。

Abstract: This paper investigates federated multimodal learning (FML) assisted by
unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with a focus on minimizing system latency and
providing convergence analysis. In this framework, UAVs are distributed
throughout the network to collect data, participate in model training, and
collaborate with a base station (BS) to build a global model. By utilizing
multimodal sensing, the UAVs overcome the limitations of unimodal systems,
enhancing model accuracy, generalization, and offering a more comprehensive
understanding of the environment. The primary objective is to optimize FML
system latency in UAV networks by jointly addressing UAV sensing scheduling,
power control, trajectory planning, resource allocation, and BS resource
management. To address the computational complexity of our latency minimization
problem, we propose an efficient iterative optimization algorithm combining
block coordinate descent and successive convex approximation techniques, which
provides high-quality approximate solutions. We also present a theoretical
convergence analysis for the UAV-assisted FML framework under a non-convex loss
function. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our FML framework outperforms
existing approaches in terms of system latency and model training performance
under different data settings.

TL;DR: BD Attention (BDA) 是一种无损的注意力算法重构，通过基础分解矩阵恒等式重新组织多头投影，在保持精确输出的同时实现数学保证的加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 注意力是大语言模型和视觉语言模型的核心操作，现有优化方法如FlashAttention主要关注I/O层面的系统优化，缺乏数学保证的算法级加速方法。

Method: 基于基础分解（BD）的矩阵恒等式，将多头投影重新组织为紧凑形式，无需重新训练，仅需4秒离线准备即可应用。

Result: 在DeepSeek-V2-Lite (16B, FP16)上，BDA实现了32%更快的键/值投影和25%更小的权重，端到端困惑度仅增加0.02%（FP16）或0.0004%（FP32）。

Conclusion: BDA是首个理论上精确的无损注意力加速方法，与现有工程级优化互补，为注意力机制提供了数学保证的加速方案。

Abstract: Attention is a core operation in large language models (LLMs) and
vision-language models (VLMs). We present BD Attention (BDA), the first
lossless algorithmic reformulation of attention. BDA is enabled by a simple
matrix identity from Basis Decomposition (BD), which restructures multi-head
projections into a compact form while preserving exact outputs. Unlike
I/O-aware system optimizations such as FlashAttention, BDA provides a
mathematically guaranteed acceleration that is architecture-agnostic. On
DeepSeek-V2-Lite (16B, FP16), BDA requires only 4s of offline preparation with
no retraining required and, on modern GPUs, achieves 32% faster key/value
projections and 25% smaller weights, while increasing end-to-end perplexity
(PPL) by just 0.02% (FP16) or 0.0004% (FP32), a negligible effect on model
performance. These results position BDA as the first theoretically exact method
for lossless attention acceleration that is complementary to existing
engineering-level optimizations. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了首个使用线性函数逼近的鲁棒TD学习算法，解决了分布鲁棒强化学习中的模型不确定性问题，无需生成模型访问，并建立了样本复杂度保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有鲁棒TD学习的收敛保证仅限于表格MDP或依赖于限制性折扣因子假设，缺乏在函数逼近下的理论保证，这阻碍了鲁棒RL算法的实际应用与理论发展。

Method: 结合双时间尺度随机逼近更新和外循环目标网络更新，针对总变差距离和Wasserstein距离不确定性集设计鲁棒TD学习算法。

Result: 建立了获得ε-准确值估计的Õ(1/ε²)样本复杂度，填补了鲁棒RL算法经验成功与非鲁棒对应物理论保证之间的关键差距。

Conclusion: 该算法是首个模型无关且无需生成访问的鲁棒TD学习算法，其关键思想可轻松扩展到带函数逼近的鲁棒Q学习。

Abstract: Distributionally robust reinforcement learning (DRRL) focuses on designing
policies that achieve good performance under model uncertainties. In
particular, we are interested in maximizing the worst-case long-term discounted
reward, where the data for RL comes from a nominal model while the deployed
environment can deviate from the nominal model within a prescribed uncertainty
set. Existing convergence guarantees for robust temporal-difference (TD)
learning for policy evaluation are limited to tabular MDPs or are dependent on
restrictive discount-factor assumptions when function approximation is used. We
present the first robust TD learning with linear function approximation, where
robustness is measured with respect to the total-variation distance and
Wasserstein-l distance uncertainty set. Additionally, our algorithm is both
model-free and does not require generative access to the MDP. Our algorithm
combines a two-time-scale stochastic-approximation update with an outer-loop
target-network update. We establish an $\tilde{O}(1/\epsilon^2)$ sample
complexity to obtain an $\epsilon$-accurate value estimate. Our results close a
key gap between the empirical success of robust RL algorithms and the
non-asymptotic guarantees enjoyed by their non-robust counterparts. The key
ideas in the paper also extend in a relatively straightforward fashion to
robust Q-learning with function approximation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统离散选择模型在准确反映个体决策过程方面面临挑战，需要更有效的方法来建模工作地点选择决策。

Method: 使用深度神经网络方法建模工作地点选择，并与传统离散选择模型进行比较分析。

Result: DNN在工作地点选择建模中表现出作为DCM稳健替代方案的显著潜力。DNN在某些方面优于DCM，而DCM在评估个体属性对工作距离影响时与数据更吻合。DCM在短距离表现更好，DNN在长距离与数据和DCM表现相当。

Conclusion: 选择工作地点选择分析模型应根据具体应用需求，两种模型各有优势，需要基于特定要求进行选择。

Abstract: Discrete choice models (DCMs) have long been used to analyze workplace
location decisions, but they face challenges in accurately mirroring individual
decision-making processes. This paper presents a deep neural network (DNN)
method for modeling workplace location choices, which aims to better understand
complex decision patterns and provides better results than traditional discrete
choice models (DCMs). The study demonstrates that DNNs show significant
potential as a robust alternative to DCMs in this domain. While both models
effectively replicate the impact of job opportunities on workplace location
choices, the DNN outperforms the DCM in certain aspects. However, the DCM
better aligns with data when assessing the influence of individual attributes
on workplace distance. Notably, DCMs excel at shorter distances, while DNNs
perform comparably to both data and DCMs for longer distances. These findings
underscore the importance of selecting the appropriate model based on specific
application requirements in workplace location choice analysis.

TL;DR: 本文分析了差分隐私随机梯度下降（DPSGD）对模型公平性的影响，研究了直接优化差分隐私模型超参数是否能缓解公平性差异，并评估了DPSGD-Global-Adapt方法的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大多数研究表明DPSGD对公平性有负面影响，但最近有研究声称通过直接在差分隐私模型上优化超参数可以实现与非私有模型相当的公平性水平。本文旨在验证这一主张的普适性。

Method: 1）比较DPSGD对不同性能指标的差异影响；2）在广泛的超参数设置下分析这种影响；3）评估DPSGD-Global-Adapt方法的鲁棒性。

Result: 研究发现：不同指标的差异影响不一定一致；直接在差分隐私模型上优化超参数不能可靠地缓解DPSGD的差异影响，但相比重用非私有模型超参数，能改善效用-公平性权衡；DPSGD-Global-Adapt对超参数选择不具鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 超参数调优会带来额外的隐私泄露，需要在隐私、效用和公平性之间仔细权衡。直接在差分隐私模型上优化超参数虽能改善效用-公平性权衡，但不能可靠解决公平性差异问题。

Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) is a prominent method for protecting information
about individuals during data analysis. Training neural networks with
differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DPSGD) influences the
model's learning dynamics and, consequently, its output. This can affect the
model's performance and fairness. While the majority of studies on the topic
report a negative impact on fairness, it has recently been suggested that
fairness levels comparable to non-private models can be achieved by optimizing
hyperparameters for performance directly on differentially private models
(rather than re-using hyperparameters from non-private models, as is common
practice). In this work, we analyze the generalizability of this claim by 1)
comparing the disparate impact of DPSGD on different performance metrics, and
2) analyzing it over a wide range of hyperparameter settings. We highlight that
a disparate impact on one metric does not necessarily imply a disparate impact
on another. Most importantly, we show that while optimizing hyperparameters
directly on differentially private models does not mitigate the disparate
impact of DPSGD reliably, it can still lead to improved utility-fairness
trade-offs compared to re-using hyperparameters from non-private models. We
stress, however, that any form of hyperparameter tuning entails additional
privacy leakage, calling for careful considerations of how to balance privacy,
utility and fairness. Finally, we extend our analyses to DPSGD-Global-Adapt, a
variant of DPSGD designed to mitigate the disparate impact on accuracy, and
conclude that this alternative may not be a robust solution with respect to
hyperparameter choice.

Conclusion: 无监督动态特征选择能有效增强潜在表示，提高模型性能，且不依赖标注数据，具有广泛适用性

Abstract: Latent representations are critical for the performance and robustness of
machine learning models, as they encode the essential features of data in a
compact and informative manner. However, in vision tasks, these representations
are often affected by noisy or irrelevant features, which can degrade the
model's performance and generalization capabilities. This paper presents a
novel approach for enhancing latent representations using unsupervised Dynamic
Feature Selection (DFS). For each instance, the proposed method identifies and
removes misleading or redundant information in images, ensuring that only the
most relevant features contribute to the latent space. By leveraging an
unsupervised framework, our approach avoids reliance on labeled data, making it
broadly applicable across various domains and datasets. Experiments conducted
on image datasets demonstrate that models equipped with unsupervised DFS
achieve significant improvements in generalization performance across various
tasks, including clustering and image generation, while incurring a minimal
increase in the computational cost.

Motivation: 现有强化学习研究需要多样化、可扩展的环境，但现代视频游戏计算成本高且不适合大规模实验。需要提供GPU加速的替代方案。

Method: 基于CHIP-8模拟器在JAX中实现经典街机游戏环境，提供图像化环境，涵盖解谜、动作和策略类型，支持大规模GPU执行。

Conclusion: Octax为JAX社区提供了期待已久的端到端GPU替代方案，其模块化设计便于扩展，是理想的大规模强化学习实验平台。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) research requires diverse, challenging
environments that are both tractable and scalable. While modern video games may
offer rich dynamics, they are computationally expensive and poorly suited for
large-scale experimentation due to their CPU-bound execution. We introduce
Octax, a high-performance suite of classic arcade game environments implemented
in JAX, based on CHIP-8 emulation, a predecessor to Atari, which is widely
adopted as a benchmark in RL research. Octax provides the JAX community with a
long-awaited end-to-end GPU alternative to the Atari benchmark, offering
image-based environments, spanning puzzle, action, and strategy genres, all
executable at massive scale on modern GPUs. Our JAX-based implementation
achieves orders-of-magnitude speedups over traditional CPU emulators while
maintaining perfect fidelity to the original game mechanics. We demonstrate
Octax's capabilities by training RL agents across multiple games, showing
significant improvements in training speed and scalability compared to existing
solutions. The environment's modular design enables researchers to easily
extend the suite with new games or generate novel environments using large
language models, making it an ideal platform for large-scale RL
experimentation.

Conclusion: 识别了数值不稳定问题并提出了有效的解决方案，能够成功学习复杂的非正则哈密顿动力学系统。

Abstract: This work focuses on learning non-canonical Hamiltonian dynamics from data,
where long-term predictions require the preservation of structure both in the
learned model and in numerical schemes. Previous research focused on either
facet, respectively with a potential-based architecture and with degenerate
variational integrators, but new issues arise when combining both. In
experiments, the learnt model is sometimes numerically unstable due to the
gauge dependency of the scheme, rendering long-time simulations impossible. In
this paper, we identify this problem and propose two different training
strategies to address it, either by directly learning the vector field or by
learning a time-discrete dynamics through the scheme. Several numerical test
cases assess the ability of the methods to learn complex physical dynamics,
like the guiding center from gyrokinetic plasma physics.

Method: 对胸部X光合成应用过滤管道进行严格评估，分析过滤器在检测真实图像和训练数据生成的近似重复样本方面的表现。

Result: 现有过滤器特异性有限且不一致，对真实图像具有高敏感性，但无法可靠检测训练数据生成的近似重复样本。

Conclusion: 后处理过滤方法存在关键限制，在敏感应用中部署前需要过滤器设计的实质性改进。

Abstract: The generation of privacy-preserving synthetic datasets is a promising avenue
for overcoming data scarcity in medical AI research. Post-hoc privacy filtering
techniques, designed to remove samples containing personally identifiable
information, have recently been proposed as a solution. However, their
effectiveness remains largely unverified. This work presents a rigorous
evaluation of a filtering pipeline applied to chest X-ray synthesis. Contrary
to claims from the original publications, our results demonstrate that current
filters exhibit limited specificity and consistency, achieving high sensitivity
only for real images while failing to reliably detect near-duplicates generated
from training data. These results demonstrate a critical limitation of post-hoc
filtering: rather than effectively safeguarding patient privacy, these methods
may provide a false sense of security while leaving unacceptable levels of
patient information exposed. We conclude that substantial advances in filter
design are needed before these methods can be confidently deployed in sensitive
applications.

TL;DR: 提出Hourglass MLP架构，颠覆传统窄-宽-窄设计，采用宽-窄-宽结构，在扩展维度上使用跳跃连接，通过窄瓶颈进行残差计算，在生成任务中实现更优的性能-参数帕累托前沿。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战传统MLP的窄-宽-窄设计惯例，探索跳跃连接在扩展维度而非输入/输出维度操作的可能性，以利用高维空间进行增量精化同时保持计算效率。

Method: 提出Hourglass MLP块，采用宽-窄-宽结构，初始投影将输入提升到扩展维度并保持随机初始化不变，通过系统架构搜索评估生成任务性能。

Result: Hourglass架构在多个图像数据集上始终优于传统设计，随着参数预算增加，最优配置倾向于更深的网络、更宽的跳跃连接和更窄的瓶颈。

Conclusion: 需要重新考虑现代架构中跳跃连接的位置，这一发现可扩展到Transformer和其他残差网络。

Abstract: Multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) conventionally follow a narrow-wide-narrow
design where skip connections operate at the input/output dimensions while
processing occurs in expanded hidden spaces. We challenge this convention by
proposing wide-narrow-wide (Hourglass) MLP blocks where skip connections
operate at expanded dimensions while residual computation flows through narrow
bottlenecks. This inversion leverages higher-dimensional spaces for incremental
refinement while maintaining computational efficiency through parameter-matched
designs. Implementing Hourglass MLPs requires an initial projection to lift
input signals to expanded dimensions. We propose that this projection can
remain fixed at random initialization throughout training, enabling efficient
training and inference implementations. We evaluate both architectures on
generative tasks over popular image datasets, characterizing
performance-parameter Pareto frontiers through systematic architectural search.
Results show that Hourglass architectures consistently achieve superior Pareto
frontiers compared to conventional designs. As parameter budgets increase,
optimal Hourglass configurations favor deeper networks with wider skip
connections and narrower bottlenecks-a scaling pattern distinct from
conventional MLPs. Our findings suggest reconsidering skip connection placement
in modern architectures, with potential applications extending to Transformers
and other residual networks.

TL;DR: 提出了稀疏查询注意力(SQA)架构，通过减少查询头数量来降低注意力机制的计算复杂度，在长序列处理中实现高达3倍的吞吐量提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多头注意力(MHA)的二次计算复杂度限制了长上下文应用的扩展性，现有方法如MQA和GQA虽然解决了内存带宽瓶颈，但未减少注意力分数计算所需的FLOPs。

Method: SQA通过减少查询头数量来直接降低注意力机制的计算复杂度，提出了理论基础和数学公式，以及一系列架构变体。

Result: 在32k-200k tokens的长序列基准测试中，SQA在计算受限场景下实现高达3倍的吞吐量提升，对小规模实验中的模型质量影响极小。

Conclusion: SQA为构建更高效和可扩展的模型提供了有力工具，是在开发反应式Transformer架构过程中偶然发现的创新方法。

Abstract: The Transformer architecture, underpinned by the Multi-Head Attention (MHA)
mechanism, has become the de facto standard for state-of-the-art models in
artificial intelligence. However, the quadratic computational complexity of MHA
with respect to sequence length presents a significant barrier to scaling,
particularly for applications involving long contexts. Prevailing solutions,
such as Multi-Query Attention (MQA) and Grouped-Query Attention (GQA), have
effectively addressed the memory bandwidth bottleneck that dominates
autoregressive inference latency by sharing Key and Value projections. While
highly successful, these methods do not reduce the fundamental number of
floating-point operations (FLOPs) required for the attention score computation,
which remains a critical bottleneck for training and full-sequence processing.
This paper introduces Sparse Query Attention (SQA), a novel attention
architecture that pursues an alternative and complementary optimization path.
Instead of reducing Key/Value heads, SQA reduces the number of Query heads.
This architectural modification directly decreases the computational complexity
of the attention mechanism by a factor proportional to the reduction in query
heads, thereby lowering the overall FLOPs. This work presents the theoretical
foundation of SQA, its mathematical formulation, and a family of architectural
variants. Empirical benchmarks on long sequences (32k-200k tokens) demonstrate
that SQA can achieve significant throughput improvements of up to 3x in
computation-bound scenarios such as model pre-training, fine-tuning, and
encoder-based tasks, with only a minimal impact on model quality in preliminary
smallscale experiments. SQA was discovered serendipitously during the
development of the upcoming Reactive Transformer architecture, suggesting its
potential as a powerful tool for building more efficient and scalable models

Motivation: 现有方法在探索高价值样本方面有效，但由于奖励信号稀疏和狭窄，导致偏好对齐效果不佳。

Method: 1) 奇异随机采样策略：支持逐步随机探索，增强奖励与注入噪声的相关性；2) 多粒度优势集成模块：聚合多个扩散尺度的优势计算，提供更全面的采样方向评估。

Conclusion: G²RPO框架在扩散模型强化学习中实现了更精确和稳健的偏好对齐，证明了其有效性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: The integration of online reinforcement learning (RL) into diffusion and flow
models has recently emerged as a promising approach for aligning generative
models with human preferences. Stochastic sampling via Stochastic Differential
Equations (SDE) is employed during the denoising process to generate diverse
denoising directions for RL exploration. While existing methods effectively
explore potential high-value samples, they suffer from sub-optimal preference
alignment due to sparse and narrow reward signals. To address these challenges,
we propose a novel Granular-GRPO ($\text{G}^2$RPO ) framework that achieves
precise and comprehensive reward assessments of sampling directions in
reinforcement learning of flow models. Specifically, a Singular Stochastic
Sampling strategy is introduced to support step-wise stochastic exploration
while enforcing a high correlation between the reward and the injected noise,
thereby facilitating a faithful reward for each SDE perturbation. Concurrently,
to eliminate the bias inherent in fixed-granularity denoising, we introduce a
Multi-Granularity Advantage Integration module that aggregates advantages
computed at multiple diffusion scales, producing a more comprehensive and
robust evaluation of the sampling directions. Experiments conducted on various
reward models, including both in-domain and out-of-domain evaluations,
demonstrate that our $\text{G}^2$RPO significantly outperforms existing
flow-based GRPO baselines,highlighting its effectiveness and robustness.

TL;DR: 提出了一种顺序不变的强化学习框架用于黑盒组合优化，通过随机生成顺序训练多变量自回归生成模型，提高样本效率并避免灾难性失败。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统分布估计算法依赖学习显式变量依赖图，成本高且难以有效捕捉复杂交互。需要一种更高效的方法来处理组合优化问题。

Method: 使用多变量自回归生成模型，在训练过程中采样随机生成顺序（信息保留dropout），使模型对变量顺序不变，并采用广义强化策略优化进行稳定策略梯度更新。

Result: 在广泛的基准算法和不同规模问题实例上，该方法经常获得最佳性能，并始终避免灾难性失败。

Conclusion: 提出的顺序不变强化学习框架在组合优化中表现出色，通过促进搜索空间多样性和关注最相关变量依赖关系，显著提高了样本效率。

Abstract: We introduce an order-invariant reinforcement learning framework for
black-box combinatorial optimization. Classical estimation-of-distribution
algorithms (EDAs) often rely on learning explicit variable dependency graphs,
which can be costly and fail to capture complex interactions efficiently. In
contrast, we parameterize a multivariate autoregressive generative model
trained without a fixed variable ordering. By sampling random generation orders
during training - a form of information-preserving dropout - the model is
encouraged to be invariant to variable order, promoting search-space diversity
and shaping the model to focus on the most relevant variable dependencies,
improving sample efficiency. We adapt Generalized Reinforcement Policy
Optimization (GRPO) to this setting, providing stable policy-gradient updates
from scale-invariant advantages. Across a wide range of benchmark algorithms
and problem instances of varying sizes, our method frequently achieves the best
performance and consistently avoids catastrophic failures.

Conclusion: 该方法为AutoML工作流程提供了转变，通过预判模型选择来优化搜索过程，在保持性能的同时大幅降低计算成本。

Abstract: The field of AutoML has made remarkable progress in post-hoc model selection,
with libraries capable of automatically identifying the most performing models
for a given dataset. Nevertheless, these methods often rely on exhaustive
hyperparameter searches, where methods automatically train and test different
types of models on the target dataset. Contrastingly, pre-hoc prediction
emerges as a promising alternative, capable of bypassing exhaustive search
through intelligent pre-selection of models. Despite its potential, pre-hoc
prediction remains under-explored in the literature. This paper explores the
intersection of AutoML and pre-hoc model selection by leveraging traditional
models and Large Language Model (LLM) agents to reduce the search space of
AutoML libraries. By relying on dataset descriptions and statistical
information, we reduce the AutoML search space. Our methodology is applied to
the AWS AutoGluon portfolio dataset, a state-of-the-art AutoML benchmark
containing 175 tabular classification datasets available on OpenML. The
proposed approach offers a shift in AutoML workflows, significantly reducing
computational overhead, while still selecting the best model for the given
dataset.

Conclusion: 模型检查可以作为学习形式语言表示的目标函数，为形式验证领域的表示学习开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Model checking is a key technique for verifying safety-critical systems
against formal specifications, where recent applications of deep learning have
shown promise. However, while ubiquitous for vision and language domains,
representation learning remains underexplored in formal verification. We
introduce Contrastive Neural Model Checking (CNML), a novel method that
leverages the model checking task as a guiding signal for learning aligned
representations. CNML jointly embeds logical specifications and systems into a
shared latent space through a self-supervised contrastive objective. On
industry-inspired retrieval tasks, CNML considerably outperforms both
algorithmic and neural baselines in cross-modal and intra-modal settings.We
further show that the learned representations effectively transfer to
downstream tasks and generalize to more complex formulas. These findings
demonstrate that model checking can serve as an objective for learning
representations for formal languages.

Conclusion: APS方法有效克服了离散扩散后验采样的关键挑战，在无需训练的风格化和文本引导编辑中展现出优势。

Abstract: We study the problem of posterior sampling using pretrained discrete
diffusion foundation models, aiming to recover images from noisy measurements
without retraining task-specific models. While diffusion models have achieved
remarkable success in generative modeling, most advances rely on continuous
Gaussian diffusion. In contrast, discrete diffusion offers a unified framework
for jointly modeling categorical data such as text and images. Beyond
unification, discrete diffusion provides faster inference, finer control, and
principled training-free Bayesian inference, making it particularly well-suited
for posterior sampling. However, existing approaches to discrete diffusion
posterior sampling face severe challenges: derivative-free guidance yields
sparse signals, continuous relaxations limit applicability, and split Gibbs
samplers suffer from the curse of dimensionality. To overcome these
limitations, we introduce Anchored Posterior Sampling (APS) for masked
diffusion foundation models, built on two key innovations -- quantized
expectation for gradient-like guidance in discrete embedding space, and
anchored remasking for adaptive decoding. Our approach achieves
state-of-the-art performance among discrete diffusion samplers across linear
and nonlinear inverse problems on the standard benchmarks. We further
demonstrate the benefits of our approach in training-free stylization and
text-guided editing.

Conclusion: LieNLSD是首个能够确定非线性无穷小生成元数量及其显式表达式的方法，在复杂对称性发现方面具有重要价值。

Abstract: Symmetry is widely applied in problems such as the design of equivariant
networks and the discovery of governing equations, but in complex scenarios, it
is not known in advance. Most previous symmetry discovery methods are limited
to linear symmetries, and recent attempts to discover nonlinear symmetries fail
to explicitly get the Lie algebra subspace. In this paper, we propose LieNLSD,
which is, to our knowledge, the first method capable of determining the number
of infinitesimal generators with nonlinear terms and their explicit
expressions. We specify a function library for the infinitesimal group action
and aim to solve for its coefficient matrix, proving that its prolongation
formula for differential equations, which governs dynamic data, is also linear
with respect to the coefficient matrix. By substituting the central differences
of the data and the Jacobian matrix of the trained neural network into the
infinitesimal criterion, we get a system of linear equations for the
coefficient matrix, which can then be solved using SVD. On top quark tagging
and a series of dynamic systems, LieNLSD shows qualitative advantages over
existing methods and improves the long rollout accuracy of neural PDE solvers
by over 20% while applying to guide data augmentation. Code and data are
available at https://github.com/hulx2002/LieNLSD.

Abstract: Updating diffusion models in an incremental setting would be practical in
real-world applications yet computationally challenging. We present a novel
learning strategy of Concept Neuron Selection (CNS), a simple yet effective
approach to perform personalization in a continual learning scheme. CNS
uniquely identifies neurons in diffusion models that are closely related to the
target concepts. In order to mitigate catastrophic forgetting problems while
preserving zero-shot text-to-image generation ability, CNS finetunes concept
neurons in an incremental manner and jointly preserves knowledge learned of
previous concepts. Evaluation of real-world datasets demonstrates that CNS
achieves state-of-the-art performance with minimal parameter adjustments,
outperforming previous methods in both single and multi-concept personalization
works. CNS also achieves fusion-free operation, reducing memory storage and

Conclusion: 该框架结合了神经网络的表达能力和概率推断的数据效率，实现了快速组合式元学习。

Abstract: To solve a new task from minimal experience, it is essential to effectively
reuse knowledge from previous tasks, a problem known as meta-learning.
Compositional solutions, where common elements of computation are flexibly
recombined into new configurations, are particularly well-suited for
meta-learning. Here, we propose a compositional meta-learning model that
explicitly represents tasks as structured combinations of reusable
computations. We achieve this by learning a generative model that captures the
underlying components and their statistics shared across a family of tasks.
This approach transforms learning a new task into a probabilistic inference
problem, which allows for finding solutions without parameter updates through
highly constrained hypothesis testing. Our model successfully recovers ground
truth components and statistics in rule learning and motor learning tasks. We
then demonstrate its ability to quickly infer new solutions from just single
examples. Together, our framework joins the expressivity of neural networks
with the data-efficiency of probabilistic inference to achieve rapid
compositional meta-learning.

Result: 在ImageNet 256×256上达到FID 1.90，超越了扩散/流模型的生成性能，并能自然处理部分噪声图像去噪、OOD检测和图像合成等任务。

Conclusion: EqM通过用统一均衡景观替代时间条件速度，为流模型和能量基模型之间提供了更紧密的桥梁，实现了优化驱动的推理路径。

Abstract: We introduce Equilibrium Matching (EqM), a generative modeling framework
built from an equilibrium dynamics perspective. EqM discards the
non-equilibrium, time-conditional dynamics in traditional diffusion and
flow-based generative models and instead learns the equilibrium gradient of an
implicit energy landscape. Through this approach, we can adopt an
optimization-based sampling process at inference time, where samples are
obtained by gradient descent on the learned landscape with adjustable step
sizes, adaptive optimizers, and adaptive compute. EqM surpasses the generation
performance of diffusion/flow models empirically, achieving an FID of 1.90 on
ImageNet 256$\times$256. EqM is also theoretically justified to learn and
sample from the data manifold. Beyond generation, EqM is a flexible framework
that naturally handles tasks including partially noised image denoising, OOD
detection, and image composition. By replacing time-conditional velocities with
a unified equilibrium landscape, EqM offers a tighter bridge between flow and
energy-based models and a simple route to optimization-driven inference.

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) is often bottlenecked by extreme memory
demands, with optimizer states dominating the footprint. Recent works mitigates
this cost by projecting gradients into low-dimensional subspaces using
sophisticated update strategies. In this paper, we analyze the dynamics of
gradient space and its underlying subspaces. We find that while a small
subspace captures most gradient energy, a significant portion still resides in
the residual bulk; moreover, the influence of the core subspace diminishes over
time and in deeper layers. We also observe that the gradient space exhibits
near-flat curvature, calling for algorithms that explicitly account for this
geometry. Motivated by these insights, we introduce a suite of randomized
algorithms, GrassWalk and GrassJump, which exploit subspace and achieve
state-of-the-art memory savings while improving performance on LLaMA-1B and
LLaMA-7B pretraining.

Abstract: Many natural dynamic processes -- such as in vivo cellular differentiation or
disease progression -- can only be observed through the lens of static sample
snapshots. While challenging, reconstructing their temporal evolution to
decipher underlying dynamic properties is of major interest to scientific
research. Existing approaches enable data transport along a temporal axis but
are poorly scalable in high dimension and require restrictive assumptions to be
met. To address these issues, we propose \textit{\textbf{Multi-Marginal
temporal Schr\"odinger Bridge Matching}} (\textbf{MMtSBM}) \textit{for video
generation from unpaired data}, extending the theoretical guarantees and
empirical efficiency of Diffusion Schr\"odinger Bridge Matching
(arXiv:archive/2303.16852) by deriving the Iterative Markovian Fitting
algorithm to multiple marginals in a novel factorized fashion. Experiments show
that MMtSBM retains theoretical properties on toy examples, achieves
state-of-the-art performance on real world datasets such as transcriptomic
trajectory inference in 100 dimensions, and for the first time recovers
couplings and dynamics in very high dimensional image settings. Our work
establishes multi-marginal Schr\"odinger bridges as a practical and principled
approach for recovering hidden dynamics from static data.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于注意力变换器的多模态基础模型，整合电子健康记录、医学影像、遗传学和可穿戴设备数据，用于早期疾病诊断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统诊断模型通常孤立分析不同医疗数据源，限制了发现跨模态相关性以进行早期疾病诊断的能力。

Method: 使用专用编码器将各模态数据映射到共享潜在空间，通过多头注意力和残差归一化进行融合，支持多任务预训练和轻松适应新疾病。

Result: 在肿瘤学、心脏病学和神经学基准数据集上测试早期检测任务，模型包含数据治理和模型管理工具以提高透明度、可靠性和临床可解释性。

Conclusion: 该方法朝着精准诊断的统一基础模型发展，有望提高预测准确性并辅助临床决策。

Abstract: Healthcare generates diverse streams of data, including electronic health
records (EHR), medical imaging, genetics, and ongoing monitoring from wearable
devices. Traditional diagnostic models frequently analyze these sources in
isolation, which constrains their capacity to identify cross-modal correlations
essential for early disease diagnosis. Our research presents a multimodal
foundation model that consolidates diverse patient data through an
attention-based transformer framework. At first, dedicated encoders put each
modality into a shared latent space. Then, they combine them using multi-head
attention and residual normalization. The architecture is made for pretraining
on many tasks, which makes it easy to adapt to new diseases and datasets with
little extra work. We provide an experimental strategy that uses benchmark
datasets in oncology, cardiology, and neurology, with the goal of testing early
detection tasks. The framework includes data governance and model management
tools in addition to technological performance to improve transparency,
reliability, and clinical interpretability. The suggested method works toward a
single foundation model for precision diagnostics, which could improve the
accuracy of predictions and help doctors make decisions.

TL;DR: 本文探索了Tsetlin Machine在大规模多通道图像分类中的应用，提出了生成局部解释和全局类别表示的方法，在保持可解释性的同时实现了与深度学习模型相竞争的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tsetlin Machine作为一种基于有限状态自动机和命题逻辑的新型机器学习范式，相比神经网络具有更好的可解释性。本文旨在探索该架构在大规模多通道图像分类中的适用性。

Method: 提出了一种生成局部解释和全局类别表示的方法论。局部解释用于解释模型预测，全局类别表示聚合每个类别的重要模式。这些解释总结了卷积子句捕获的知识，可以可视化为图像。

Result: 在MNIST数据集上达到98.5%准确率，在CelebA数据集上达到86.56% F1分数（相比ResNet50的88.07%）。TM在保持可解释性的同时，性能与深度学习模型相当。

Conclusion: Tsetlin Machine在复杂大规模训练环境中仍能保持竞争力，同时维持其可解释性优势。这有助于更好地理解TM子句，并为将该模型应用于更复杂多样的数据集提供了见解。

Abstract: The Tsetlin Machine (TM) is a novel machine learning paradigm that employs
finite-state automata for learning and utilizes propositional logic to
represent patterns. Due to its simplistic approach, TMs are inherently more
interpretable than learning algorithms based on Neural Networks. The
Convolutional TM has shown comparable performance on various datasets such as
MNIST, K-MNIST, F-MNIST and CIFAR-2. In this paper, we explore the
applicability of the TM architecture for large-scale multi-channel (RGB) image
classification. We propose a methodology to generate both local interpretations
and global class representations. The local interpretations can be used to
explain the model predictions while the global class representations aggregate
important patterns for each class. These interpretations summarize the
knowledge captured by the convolutional clauses, which can be visualized as
images. We evaluate our methods on MNIST and CelebA datasets, using models that
achieve 98.5\% accuracy on MNIST and 86.56\% F1-score on CelebA (compared to
88.07\% for ResNet50) respectively. We show that the TM performs competitively
to this deep learning model while maintaining its interpretability, even in
large-scale complex training environments. This contributes to a better
understanding of TM clauses and provides insights into how these models can be
applied to more complex and diverse datasets.

*Zhaoyan Wang,Zheng Gao,Arogya Kharel,In-Young Ko*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了RoGRAD框架，首次系统比较了传统图神经网络增强方法和基于大语言模型的图增强方法在复合缺陷下的表现，并通过检索增强的迭代对比学习框架显著提升了图学习的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的图结构数据存在多种缺陷，严重影响GNN性能。现有研究主要关注单一缺陷，缺乏对传统方法和LLM增强方法在复合缺陷下表现的全面比较，且LLM增强方法是否始终优于传统方法尚不明确。

Method: 提出RoGRAD框架，这是首个基于检索增强生成的迭代范式，通过提供类别一致且多样化的增强，并利用迭代图对比学习强制区分性表示，将LLM增强从静态信号注入转变为动态精炼。

Result: RoGRAD在广泛实验中表现出色，优于传统GNN和LLM增强基线方法，平均改进达到82.43%。

Conclusion: 研究挑战了LLM增强始终优于传统方法的假设，提出的RoGRAD框架通过动态精炼机制显著提升了图学习的鲁棒性，为图数据增强提供了新的迭代范式。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are widely adopted in Web-related applications,
serving as a core technique for learning from graph-structured data, such as
text-attributed graphs. Yet in real-world scenarios, such graphs exhibit
deficiencies that substantially undermine GNN performance. While prior
GNN-based augmentation studies have explored robustness against individual
imperfections, a systematic understanding of how graph-native and Large
Language Models (LLMs) enhanced methods behave under compound deficiencies is
still missing. Specifically, there has been no comprehensive investigation
comparing conventional approaches and recent LLM-on-graph frameworks, leaving
their merits unclear. To fill this gap, we conduct the first empirical study
that benchmarks these two lines of methods across diverse graph deficiencies,
revealing overlooked vulnerabilities and challenging the assumption that LLM
augmentation is consistently superior. Building on empirical findings, we
propose Robust Graph Learning via Retrieval-Augmented Contrastive Refinement
(RoGRAD) framework. Unlike prior one-shot LLM-as-Enhancer designs, RoGRAD is
the first iterative paradigm that leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) to inject retrieval-grounded augmentations by supplying class-consistent,
diverse augmentations and enforcing discriminative representations through
iterative graph contrastive learning. It transforms LLM augmentation for graphs
from static signal injection into dynamic refinement. Extensive experiments
demonstrate RoGRAD's superiority over both conventional GNN- and LLM-enhanced
baselines, achieving up to 82.43% average improvement.

TL;DR: 提出了一种几何感知的LoRA扩展方法，通过三因子分解U、S、V⊤，将适配器的输入和输出子空间与缩放因子分离，约束U和V在Stiefel流形上保持正交性，从而提升低秩适应的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的低秩适应(LoRA)方法在性能上仍落后于全参数微调，部分原因是未能充分利用低秩流形的几何结构。

Method: 使用三因子分解U、S、V⊤，约束U和V在Stiefel流形上保持正交性，采用几何优化设计将欧几里得优化器转换为黎曼优化器。

Result: 在常识推理、数学和代码生成、图像分类、图像生成等广泛下游任务中，该方法优于当前最先进的LoRA变体。

Conclusion: 提出的几何感知LoRA扩展方法通过充分利用低秩流形的几何结构，显著提升了参数高效微调的性能。

Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) has been widely adopted as a parameter-efficient
technique for fine-tuning large-scale pre-trained models. However, it still
lags behind full fine-tuning in performance, partly due to its insufficient
exploitation of the geometric structure underlying low-rank manifolds. In this
paper, we propose a geometry-aware extension of LoRA that uses a three-factor
decomposition $U\!SV^\top$. Analogous to the structure of singular value
decomposition (SVD), it separates the adapter's input and output subspaces, $V$
and $U$, from the scaling factor $S$. Our method constrains $U$ and $V$ to lie
on the Stiefel manifold, ensuring their orthonormality throughout the training.
To optimize on the Stiefel manifold, we employ a flexible and modular geometric
optimization design that converts any Euclidean optimizer to a Riemannian one.
It enables efficient subspace learning while remaining compatible with existing
fine-tuning pipelines. Empirical results across a wide range of downstream
tasks, including commonsense reasoning, math and code generation, image
classification, and image generation, demonstrate the superior performance of
our approach against the recent state-of-the-art variants of LoRA. Code is

Conclusion: 本文成功扩展了对抗鲁棒性理论到任意损失函数，建立了对抗鲁棒性与优化理论中其他重要问题的联系，为设计更实用的鲁棒分类器提供了理论基础和计算工具。

Abstract: We consider adversarially robust classification in a multiclass setting under
arbitrary loss functions and derive dual and barycentric reformulations of the
corresponding learner-agnostic robust risk minimization problem. We provide
explicit characterizations for important cases such as the cross-entropy loss,
loss functions with a power form, and the quadratic loss, extending in this way
available results for the 0-1 loss. These reformulations enable efficient
computation of sharp lower bounds for adversarial risks and facilitate the
design of robust classifiers beyond the 0-1 loss setting. Our paper uncovers
interesting connections between adversarial robustness, $\alpha$-fair packing
problems, and generalized barycenter problems for arbitrary positive measures
where Kullback-Leibler and Tsallis entropies are used as penalties. Our
theoretical results are accompanied with illustrative numerical experiments
where we obtain tighter lower bounds for adversarial risks with the
cross-entropy loss function.

Conclusion: Moon框架通过模态转换和多模态特征融合，有效解决了现有MTS异常检测方法的局限性，在效率、准确性和可解释性方面均有显著提升。

Abstract: Multivariate time series (MTS) anomaly detection identifies abnormal patterns
where each timestamp contains multiple variables. Existing MTS anomaly
detection methods fall into three categories: reconstruction-based,
prediction-based, and classifier-based methods. However, these methods face two
key challenges: (1) Unsupervised learning methods, such as reconstruction-based
and prediction-based methods, rely on error thresholds, which can lead to
inaccuracies; (2) Semi-supervised methods mainly model normal data and often
underuse anomaly labels, limiting detection of subtle anomalies;(3) Supervised
learning methods, such as classifier-based approaches, often fail to capture
local relationships, incur high computational costs, and are constrained by the
scarcity of labeled data. To address these limitations, we propose Moon, a
supervised modality conversion-based multivariate time series anomaly detection
framework. Moon enhances the efficiency and accuracy of anomaly detection while
providing detailed anomaly analysis reports. First, Moon introduces a novel
multivariate Markov Transition Field (MV-MTF) technique to convert numeric time
series data into image representations, capturing relationships across
variables and timestamps. Since numeric data retains unique patterns that
cannot be fully captured by image conversion alone, Moon employs a
Multimodal-CNN to integrate numeric and image data through a feature fusion
model with parameter sharing, enhancing training efficiency. Finally, a
SHAP-based anomaly explainer identifies key variables contributing to
anomalies, improving interpretability. Extensive experiments on six real-world
MTS datasets demonstrate that Moon outperforms six state-of-the-art methods by
up to 93% in efficiency, 4% in accuracy and, 10.8% in interpretation
performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习在医疗和金融等关键领域应用广泛，这些领域对模型校准有强烈需求，但联邦私有校准问题一直被忽视。需要解决在数据分布在不同客户端且无法集中情况下的模型校准问题。

Method: 将传统集中式校准方法（直方图分箱和温度缩放）转移到联邦环境，定义了在强客户端异构性下操作的新方法，研究了联邦设置和用户级差分隐私设置。

Result: 发现联邦和差分隐私都会影响校准准确性，提出了缓解异构性下性能下降的策略。联邦温度缩放最适合差分隐私联邦学习，而加权分箱方法在不需要差分隐私时表现最佳。

Conclusion: 成功将后处理模型校准技术集成到联邦学习中，为联邦环境下的可靠概率预测提供了有效解决方案，特别是在异构性和隐私保护要求下。

Abstract: Calibrating machine learning models so that predicted probabilities better
reflect the true outcome frequencies is crucial for reliable decision-making
across many applications. In Federated Learning (FL), the goal is to train a
global model on data which is distributed across multiple clients and cannot be
centralized due to privacy concerns. FL is applied in key areas such as
healthcare and finance where calibration is strongly required, yet federated
private calibration has been largely overlooked. This work introduces the
integration of post-hoc model calibration techniques within FL. Specifically,
we transfer traditional centralized calibration methods such as histogram
binning and temperature scaling into federated environments and define new
methods to operate them under strong client heterogeneity. We study (1) a
federated setting and (2) a user-level Differential Privacy (DP) setting and
demonstrate how both federation and DP impacts calibration accuracy. We propose
strategies to mitigate degradation commonly observed under heterogeneity and
our findings highlight that our federated temperature scaling works best for
DP-FL whereas our weighted binning approach is best when DP is not required.

Conclusion: 几何信息驱动的探索为抗菌肽设计提供了强大的新范式。

Abstract: Antimicrobial peptide discovery is challenged by the astronomical size of
peptide space and the relative scarcity of active peptides. Generative models
provide continuous latent "maps" of peptide space, but conventionally ignore
decoder-induced geometry and rely on flat Euclidean metrics, rendering
exploration and optimization distorted and inefficient. Prior manifold-based
remedies assume fixed intrinsic dimensionality, which critically fails in
practice for peptide data. Here, we introduce PepCompass, a geometry-aware
framework for peptide exploration and optimization. At its core, we define a
Union of $\kappa$-Stable Riemannian Manifolds $\mathbb{M}^{\kappa}$, a family
of decoder-induced manifolds that captures local geometry while ensuring
computational stability. We propose two local exploration methods: Second-Order
Riemannian Brownian Efficient Sampling, which provides a convergent
second-order approximation to Riemannian Brownian motion, and Mutation
Enumeration in Tangent Space, which reinterprets tangent directions as discrete
amino-acid substitutions. Combining these yields Local Enumeration Bayesian
Optimization (LE-BO), an efficient algorithm for local activity optimization.
Finally, we introduce Potential-minimizing Geodesic Search (PoGS), which
interpolates between prototype embeddings along property-enriched geodesics,
biasing discovery toward seeds, i.e. peptides with favorable activity. In-vitro
validation confirms the effectiveness of PepCompass: PoGS yields four novel
seeds, and subsequent optimization with LE-BO discovers 25 highly active
peptides with broad-spectrum activity, including against resistant bacterial
strains. These results demonstrate that geometry-informed exploration provides
a powerful new paradigm for antimicrobial peptide design.

TL;DR: 提出了GraphNC框架，通过异常分数分布对齐和基于扰动的正态性正则化来校准图异常检测中的正态性，提高检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的半监督图异常检测方法仅基于标注的正常节点学习正态性，容易过拟合给定模式，导致高误检率。需要利用未标注数据来校准正态性。

Method: GraphNC包含两个组件：异常分数分布对齐(ScoreDA)通过对齐教师模型的分数分布来优化异常分数；基于扰动的正态性正则化(NormReg)通过在标注节点上最小化扰动引导的一致性损失来使正常节点表示更紧凑。

Result: 该方法通过分数对齐使正常和异常类别的异常分数更可分离，同时通过表示空间的正则化减轻不准确分数的影响。

Conclusion: GraphNC框架能够有效校准图正态性，提高半监督图异常检测的性能，减少误检率。

Abstract: Graph anomaly detection (GAD) has attracted growing interest for its crucial
ability to uncover irregular patterns in broad applications. Semi-supervised
GAD, which assumes a subset of annotated normal nodes available during
training, is among the most widely explored application settings. However, the
normality learned by existing semi-supervised GAD methods is limited to the
labeled normal nodes, often inclining to overfitting the given patterns. These
can lead to high detection errors, such as high false positives. To overcome
this limitation, we propose GraphNC , a graph normality calibration framework
that leverages both labeled and unlabeled data to calibrate the normality from
a teacher model (a pre-trained semi-supervised GAD model) jointly in anomaly
score and node representation spaces. GraphNC includes two main components,
anomaly score distribution alignment (ScoreDA) and perturbation-based normality
regularization (NormReg). ScoreDA optimizes the anomaly scores of our model by
aligning them with the score distribution yielded by the teacher model. Due to
accurate scores in most of the normal nodes and part of the anomaly nodes in
the teacher model, the score alignment effectively pulls the anomaly scores of
the normal and abnormal classes toward the two ends, resulting in more
separable anomaly scores. Nevertheless, there are inaccurate scores from the
teacher model. To mitigate the misleading by these scores, NormReg is designed
to regularize the graph normality in the representation space, making the
representations of normal nodes more compact by minimizing a
perturbation-guided consistency loss solely on the labeled nodes.

Abstract: As AI systems become more embedded in everyday life, the development of fair
and unbiased models becomes more critical. Considering the social impact of AI
systems is not merely a technical challenge but a moral imperative. As
evidenced in numerous research studies, learning fair and robust
representations has proven to be a powerful approach to effectively debiasing
algorithms and improving fairness while maintaining essential information for
prediction tasks. Representation learning frameworks, particularly those that
utilize self-supervised and contrastive learning, have demonstrated superior
robustness and generalizability across various domains. Despite the growing
interest in applying these approaches to tabular data, the issue of fairness in
these learned representations remains underexplored. In this study, we
introduce a contrastive learning framework specifically designed to address
bias and learn fair representations in tabular datasets. By strategically
selecting positive pair samples and employing supervised and self-supervised
contrastive learning, we significantly reduce bias compared to existing
state-of-the-art contrastive learning models for tabular data. Our results
demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in mitigating bias with minimum
trade-off in accuracy and leveraging the learned fair representations in
various downstream tasks.

Abstract: In deep learning, dense layer connectivity has become a key design principle
in deep neural networks (DNNs), enabling efficient information flow and strong
performance across a range of applications. In this work, we model densely
connected DNNs mathematically and analyze their learning problems in the
deep-layer limit. For a broad applicability, we present our analysis in a
framework setting of DNNs with densely connected layers and general non-local
feature transformations (with local feature transformations as special cases)
within layers, which is called dense non-local (DNL) framework and includes
standard DenseNets and variants as special examples. In this formulation, the
densely connected networks are modeled as nonlinear integral equations, in
contrast to the ordinary differential equation viewpoint commonly adopted in
prior works. We study the associated training problems from an optimal control
perspective and prove convergence results from the network learning problem to
its continuous-time counterpart. In particular, we show the convergence of
optimal values and the subsequence convergence of minimizers, using a piecewise
linear extension and $\Gamma$-convergence analysis. Our results provide a
mathematical foundation for understanding densely connected DNNs and further
suggest that such architectures can offer stability of training deep models.

Motivation: 单一流模型在不同类型的分布上表现不一致，需要一种更鲁棒的变分推理方法来处理多样化的后验分布

Method: 两阶段训练：先顺序训练各个流专家，然后通过似然驱动的更新进行自适应全局权重估计，无需逐样本门控或架构改变

Result: 在六种典型后验分布上，AMF-VI始终获得比单一流基线更低的负对数似然，在Wasserstein-2和MMD指标上表现稳定提升

Conclusion: 自适应混合多样化流模型为跨不同后验分布的鲁棒变分推理提供了可靠途径，同时保留了每个专家的归纳偏差

Abstract: Normalising-flow variational inference (VI) can approximate complex
posteriors, yet single-flow models often behave inconsistently across
qualitatively different distributions. We propose Adaptive Mixture Flow
Variational Inference (AMF-VI), a heterogeneous mixture of complementary flows
(MAF, RealNVP, RBIG) trained in two stages: (i) sequential expert training of
individual flows, and (ii) adaptive global weight estimation via
likelihood-driven updates, without per-sample gating or architectural changes.
Evaluated on six canonical posterior families of banana, X-shape, two-moons,
rings, a bimodal, and a five-mode mixture, AMF-VI achieves consistently lower
negative log-likelihood than each single-flow baseline and delivers stable
gains in transport metrics (Wasserstein-2) and maximum mean discrepancy (MDD),
indicating improved robustness across shapes and modalities. The procedure is
efficient and architecture-agnostic, incurring minimal overhead relative to
standard flow training, and demonstrates that adaptive mixtures of diverse
flows provide a reliable route to robust VI across diverse posterior families
whilst preserving each expert's inductive bias.

Conclusion: PPGen提供了一条路径，使PPG模型既保持深度学习特征所需的保真度，又支持临床解释和硬件设计。

Abstract: Smart wearables enable continuous tracking of established biomarkers such as
heart rate, heart rate variability, and blood oxygen saturation via
photoplethysmography (PPG). Beyond these metrics, PPG waveforms contain richer
physiological information, as recent deep learning (DL) studies demonstrate.
However, DL models often rely on features with unclear physiological meaning,
creating a tension between predictive power, clinical interpretability, and
sensor design. We address this gap by introducing PPGen, a biophysical model
that relates PPG signals to interpretable physiological and optical parameters.
Building on PPGen, we propose hybrid amortized inference (HAI), enabling fast,
robust, and scalable estimation of relevant physiological parameters from PPG
signals while correcting for model misspecification. In extensive in-silico
experiments, we show that HAI can accurately infer physiological parameters
under diverse noise and sensor conditions. Our results illustrate a path toward
PPG models that retain the fidelity needed for DL-based features while
supporting clinical interpretation and informed hardware design.

Conclusion: 通过最大似然估计微调Flow Matching能有效解决训练-推理差距问题，提高模型在需要高精度任务中的性能。

Abstract: Flow Matching (FM) algorithm achieves remarkable results in generative tasks
especially in robotic manipulation. Building upon the foundations of diffusion
models, the simulation-free paradigm of FM enables simple and efficient
training, but inherently introduces a train-inference gap. Specifically, we
cannot assess the model's output during the training phase. In contrast, other
generative models including Variational Autoencoder (VAE), Normalizing Flow and
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) directly optimize on the reconstruction
loss. Such a gap is particularly evident in scenarios that demand high
precision, such as robotic manipulation. Moreover, we show that FM's
over-pursuit of straight predefined paths may introduce some serious problems
such as stiffness into the system. These motivate us to fine-tune FM via
Maximum Likelihood Estimation of reconstructions - an approach made feasible by
FM's underlying smooth ODE formulation, in contrast to the stochastic
differential equations (SDEs) used in diffusion models. This paper first
theoretically analyzes the relation between training loss and inference error
in FM. Then we propose a method of fine-tuning FM via Maximum Likelihood
Estimation of reconstructions, which includes both straightforward fine-tuning
and residual-based fine-tuning approaches. Furthermore, through specifically
designed architectures, the residual-based fine-tuning can incorporate the
contraction property into the model, which is crucial for the model's
robustness and interpretability. Experimental results in image generation and
robotic manipulation verify that our method reliably improves the inference
performance of FM.

TL;DR: KAIROS是一个非自回归时间序列预测框架，直接建模分段级多峰分布，避免了误差累积，实现了即时推理，并在六个基准测试中展示了强大的零样本泛化能力。


<details>

Motivation: 在万维网应用中，可靠的时间序列预测对于资源规划、缓存放置和异常响应至关重要。相比其他领域，Web应用需要更快的响应速度来支持实时决策。

Method: 提出KAIROS非自回归时间序列预测框架，直接建模分段级多峰分布，避免自回归方法的误差累积问题，实现即时推理。

Result: 在大规模语料库上训练后，KAIROS在六个广泛使用的基准测试中表现出强大的零样本泛化能力，预测性能与类似规模的先进基础模型相当，但推理成本仅为它们的一小部分。

Conclusion: KAIROS强调了非自回归设计作为时间序列基础模型可扩展范式的重要性，为Web应用提供了高效的时间序列预测解决方案。

Abstract: In the World Wide Web, reliable time series forecasts provide the
forward-looking signals that drive resource planning, cache placement, and
anomaly response, enabling platforms to operate efficiently as user behavior
and content distributions evolve. Compared with other domains, time series
forecasting for Web applications requires much faster responsiveness to support
real-time decision making. We present KAIROS, a non-autoregressive time series
forecasting framework that directly models segment-level multi-peak
distributions. Unlike autoregressive approaches, KAIROS avoids error
accumulation and achieves just-in-time inference, while improving over existing
non-autoregressive models that collapse to over-smoothed predictions. Trained
on the large-scale corpus, KAIROS demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization
on six widely used benchmarks, delivering forecasting performance comparable to
state-of-the-art foundation models with similar scale, at a fraction of their
inference cost. Beyond empirical results, KAIROS highlights the importance of
non-autoregressive design as a scalable paradigm for foundation models in time
series.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种直接从Hugging Face等非结构化模型仓库学习权重空间表示的方法，无需依赖精心策划的模型动物园，解决了权重空间学习领域对大规模计算资源的依赖问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 权重空间学习通常需要大量精心训练的模型动物园，这需要巨大的计算资源，限制了权重空间表示的规模和灵活性。本文旨在摆脱这一限制，直接从异构的模型仓库中学习权重表示。

Method: 提出了一种新的权重空间骨干网络，专门设计用于处理非结构化的模型群体，能够处理不同架构和数据集训练的异构模型。

Result: 在Hugging Face模型上训练的权重空间表示取得了强劲性能，通常优于在实验室生成的模型动物园上训练的骨干网络，并且能够泛化到未见过的数据模态。

Conclusion: 研究表明高质量权重空间表示可以在非结构化环境中学习，精心策划的模型动物园并非不可或缺，克服了权重空间学习社区当前面临的重要限制。

Abstract: The weights of neural networks have emerged as a novel data modality, giving
rise to the field of weight space learning. A central challenge in this area is
that learning meaningful representations of weights typically requires large,
carefully constructed collections of trained models, typically referred to as
model zoos. These model zoos are often trained ad-hoc, requiring large
computational resources, constraining the learned weight space representations
in scale and flexibility. In this work, we drop this requirement by training a
weight space learning backbone on arbitrary models downloaded from large,
unstructured model repositories such as Hugging Face. Unlike curated model
zoos, these repositories contain highly heterogeneous models: they vary in
architecture and dataset, and are largely undocumented. To address the
methodological challenges posed by such heterogeneity, we propose a new weight
space backbone designed to handle unstructured model populations. We
demonstrate that weight space representations trained on models from Hugging
Face achieve strong performance, often outperforming backbones trained on
laboratory-generated model zoos. Finally, we show that the diversity of the
model weights in our training set allows our weight space model to generalize
to unseen data modalities. By demonstrating that high-quality weight space
representations can be learned in the wild, we show that curated model zoos are
not indispensable, thereby overcoming a strong limitation currently faced by
the weight space learning community.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AdaBoost在实践中随着弱学习器数量的增加而泛化良好，但其指数损失对误标记数据点的惩罚比其他损失函数更严重。现有公式不适合一阶方法优化，因此需要新的理论基础的损失函数。

Method: 引入PENEX（惩罚指数损失），这是一种新的多类指数损失公式，通过梯度增量隐式参数化提升框架中的弱学习器，并证明其隐式最大化数据点的边界。

Result: 在计算机视觉和语言任务中，PENEX表现出比类似计算成本的现有方法更好的正则化效果，能够有效训练和微调深度神经网络。

Conclusion: PENEX作为AdaBoost启发的替代方案，在深度神经网络训练和微调中具有潜力，提供了理论基础和实际优化优势。

Abstract: AdaBoost sequentially fits so-called weak learners to minimize an exponential
loss, which penalizes mislabeled data points more severely than other loss
functions like cross-entropy. Paradoxically, AdaBoost generalizes well in
practice as the number of weak learners grows. In the present work, we
introduce Penalized Exponential Loss (PENEX), a new formulation of the
multi-class exponential loss that is theoretically grounded and, in contrast to
the existing formulation, amenable to optimization via first-order methods. We
demonstrate both empirically and theoretically that PENEX implicitly maximizes
margins of data points. Also, we show that gradient increments on PENEX
implicitly parameterize weak learners in the boosting framework. Across
computer vision and language tasks, we show that PENEX exhibits a regularizing
effect often better than established methods with similar computational cost.
Our results highlight PENEX's potential as an AdaBoost-inspired alternative for
effective training and fine-tuning of deep neural networks.

Method: 使用LSTM、GRU和混合BiLSTM-XGBoost机器学习模型，基于2017-2022年六年的天然气消费和气象数据进行分析和预测。

Result: 混合BiLSTM-XGBoost模型在准确性方面表现最优，具有更低的RMSE、MAPE和MPE值，在数据有限的情况下也表现出稳健性能。

Conclusion: 机器学习方法特别是混合模型可有效预测天然气消费，地理和气候因素对预测建模至关重要，有助于更高效的资源管理。

Abstract: Today, natural gas, as a clean fuel and the best alternative to crude oil,
covers a significant part of global demand. Iran is one of the largest
countries with energy resources and in terms of gas is the second-largest
country in the world. But, due to the increase in population and energy
consumption, it faces problems such as pressure drops and gas outages yearly in
cold seasons and therefore it is necessary to control gas consumption,
especially in the residential sector, which has the largest share in Iran. This
study aims to analyze and predict gas consumption for residential customers in
Zanjan province, Iran, using machine learning models, including LSTM, GRU, and
a hybrid BiLSTM-XGBoost model. The dataset consists of gas consumption and
meteorology data collected over six years, from 2017 to 2022. The models were
trained and evaluated based on their ability to accurately predict consumption
patterns. The results indicate that the hybrid BiLSTM-XGBoost model
outperformed the other models in terms of accuracy, with lower Root Mean
Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) values, and Mean
Percentage Error (MPE). Additionally, the Hybrid model demonstrated robust
performance, particularly in scenarios with limited data. The findings suggest
that machine learning approaches, particularly hybrid models, can be
effectively utilized to manage and predict gas consumption, contributing to
more efficient resource management and reducing seasonal shortages. This study
highlights the importance of incorporating geographical and climatic factors in
predictive modeling, as these significantly influence gas usage across
different regions.

### [236] [Ensemble Threshold Calibration for Stable Sensitivity Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02116)
*John N. Daras*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种端到端框架，通过神经网络排序器和集成阈值估计方法，在大规模空间匹配任务中实现精确的召回率控制，显著降低了运行方差和冗余验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在大规模空间匹配和实体匹配任务中，精确的召回率控制至关重要，因为遗漏少量真实匹配会破坏下游分析，而过度的手动审查会增加成本。传统置信区间方法通常会超出目标几个百分点，且在偏态分数分布下运行方差较高。

Method: 采用端到端框架：首先使用等网格边界框过滤器和CSR候选表示减少对枚举；通过确定性xxHash引导样本训练轻量级神经网络排序器；构建可重现的分数十分位分层校准集；集成四种阈值估计方法（Clopper-Pearson、Jeffreys、Wilson和精确分位数），通过逆方差加权和跨九个独立子样本融合。

Result: 在两个真实地籍数据集（约631万和6734万对）上评估，该方法始终在较小误差内达到召回目标，相比其他校准方法减少了冗余验证，并在单个TPU v3核心上端到端运行。

Conclusion: 该框架在大规模空间匹配任务中实现了精确的召回率控制，显著降低了运行方差和冗余验证成本，证明了集成阈值估计方法的有效性。

Abstract: Precise recall control is critical in large-scale spatial conflation and
entity-matching tasks, where missing even a few true matches can break
downstream analytics, while excessive manual review inflates cost. Classical
confidence-interval cuts such as Clopper-Pearson or Wilson provide lower bounds
on recall, but they routinely overshoot the target by several percentage points
and exhibit high run-to-run variance under skewed score distributions. We
present an end-to-end framework that achieves exact recall with sub-percent
variance over tens of millions of geometry pairs, while remaining TPU-friendly.
Our pipeline starts with an equigrid bounding-box filter and compressed sparse
row (CSR) candidate representation, reducing pair enumeration by two orders of
magnitude. A deterministic xxHash bootstrap sample trains a lightweight neural
ranker; its scores are propagated to all remaining pairs via a single forward
pass and used to construct a reproducible, score-decile-stratified calibration
set. Four complementary threshold estimators - Clopper-Pearson, Jeffreys,
Wilson, and an exact quantile - are aggregated via inverse-variance weighting,
then fused across nine independent subsamples. This ensemble reduces threshold
variance compared to any single method. Evaluated on two real cadastral
datasets (approximately 6.31M and 67.34M pairs), our approach consistently hits
a recall target within a small error, decreases redundant verifications
relative to other calibrations, and runs end-to-end on a single TPU v3 core.

TL;DR: DECOR是一种用于线性高斯结构方程模型的联合学习方法，能够在存在潜在混杂因素的情况下同时学习有向无环图和相关噪声模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在误差独立时表现良好，而去混杂先处理流程依赖于普遍因子结构或非线性。需要一种能够处理潜在混杂的统一方法。

Method: 提出DECOR方法，使用基于似然的完全可微分估计器，交替进行平滑无环图更新和凸噪声更新，可包含轻量弓形互补惩罚或后处理协调步骤。

Result: 在合成基准测试中，DECOR匹配或优于强基线方法，特别在混杂不普遍时表现稳健，在普遍混杂情况下仍保持竞争力。

Conclusion: DECOR为存在潜在混杂的线性高斯SEM结构学习提供了有效的联合估计方法，理论保证了在弓形自由图和均匀特征值边界条件下的全局参数可识别性。

Abstract: We study structure learning for linear Gaussian SEMs in the presence of
latent confounding. Existing continuous methods excel when errors are
independent, while deconfounding-first pipelines rely on pervasive factor
structure or nonlinearity. We propose \textsc{DECOR}, a single likelihood-based
and fully differentiable estimator that jointly learns a DAG and a correlated
noise model. Our theory gives simple sufficient conditions for global parameter
identifiability: if the mixed graph is bow free and the noise covariance has a
uniform eigenvalue margin, then the map from $(\B,\OmegaMat)$ to the
observational covariance is injective, so both the directed structure and the
noise are uniquely determined. The estimator alternates a smooth-acyclic graph
update with a convex noise update and can include a light bow complementarity
penalty or a post hoc reconciliation step. On synthetic benchmarks that vary
confounding density, graph density, latent rank, and dimension with $n<p$,
\textsc{DECOR} matches or outperforms strong baselines and is especially robust
when confounding is non-pervasive, while remaining competitive under
pervasiveness.

Abstract: Efficient and inexpensive energy storage is essential for accelerating the
adoption of renewable energy and ensuring a stable supply, despite fluctuations
in sources such as wind and solar. Electrocatalysts play a key role in hydrogen
energy storage (HES), allowing the energy to be stored as hydrogen. However,
the development of affordable and high-performance catalysts for this process
remains a significant challenge. We introduce Catalyst GFlowNet, a generative
model that leverages machine learning-based predictors of formation and
adsorption energy to design crystal surfaces that act as efficient catalysts.
We demonstrate the performance of the model through a proof-of-concept
application to the hydrogen evolution reaction, a key reaction in HES, for
which we successfully identified platinum as the most efficient known catalyst.
In future work, we aim to extend this approach to the oxygen evolution
reaction, where current optimal catalysts are expensive metal oxides, and open
the search space to discover new materials. This generative modeling framework
offers a promising pathway for accelerating the search for novel and efficient
catalysts.

Motivation: 将扩散模型中成功的引导技术扩展到强化学习领域，为在线强化学习提供可控性，解决传统方法需要重新训练才能调整行为的问题。

Method: 在策略梯度中增加无条件分支，通过插值条件分支和无条件分支实现引导，理论推导显示在优势估计下额外的归一化项会消失，得到简洁的引导策略梯度更新公式。

Result: 在离散和连续控制基准测试中，条件丢弃在简单离散任务和低样本情况下有效，但会破坏连续控制的稳定性；适度增大引导系数（γ>1）能持续改善稳定性、样本效率和可控性。

Conclusion: 引导技术可以成功从扩散策略扩展到标准在线策略方法，为可控在线强化学习开辟了新方向。

Abstract: We introduce Policy Gradient Guidance (PGG), a simple extension of
classifier-free guidance from diffusion models to classical policy gradient
methods. PGG augments the policy gradient with an unconditional branch and
interpolates conditional and unconditional branches, yielding a test-time
control knob that modulates behavior without retraining. We provide a
theoretical derivation showing that the additional normalization term vanishes
under advantage estimation, leading to a clean guided policy gradient update.
Empirically, we evaluate PGG on discrete and continuous control benchmarks. We
find that conditioning dropout-central to diffusion guidance-offers gains in
simple discrete tasks and low sample regimes, but dropout destabilizes
continuous control. Training with modestly larger guidance ($\gamma>1$)
consistently improves stability, sample efficiency, and controllability. Our
results show that guidance, previously confined to diffusion policies, can be
adapted to standard on-policy methods, opening new directions for controllable
online reinforcement learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We study reinforcement learning problems where state observations are
stochastically triggered by actions, a constraint common in many real-world
applications. This framework is formulated as Action-Triggered Sporadically
Traceable Markov Decision Processes (ATST-MDPs), where each action has a
specified probability of triggering a state observation. We derive tailored
Bellman optimality equations for this framework and introduce the
action-sequence learning paradigm in which agents commit to executing a
sequence of actions until the next observation arrives. Under the linear MDP
assumption, value-functions are shown to admit linear representations in an
induced action-sequence feature map. Leveraging this structure, we propose
off-policy estimators with statistical error guarantees for such feature maps
and introduce ST-LSVI-UCB, a variant of LSVI-UCB adapted for action-triggered
settings. ST-LSVI-UCB achieves regret $\widetilde
O(\sqrt{Kd^3(1-\gamma)^{-3}})$, where $K$ is the number of episodes, $d$ the
feature dimension, and $\gamma$ the discount factor (per-step episode
non-termination probability). Crucially, this work establishes the theoretical
foundation for learning with sporadic, action-triggered observations while
demonstrating that efficient learning remains feasible under such observation
constraints.

Motivation: 经典SGLD无法偏向平坦最小值，而平坦最小值与深度学习泛化能力密切相关，因此需要设计能有效寻找平坦最小值的优化方法。

Method: 使用随机权重扰动(RWP)的随机梯度Langevin动力学，通过各向同性高斯噪声扰动参数来优化随机平滑目标，隐式捕获曲率信息。

Result: 理论证明fSGLD的平稳测度集中在Hessian迹正则化损失函数的全局最小化器附近；实验在噪声标签和大规模视觉任务中显示优于或可比基线算法，计算成本仅为SGD级别。

Conclusion: fSGLD能有效寻找平坦最小值，提供随机权重扰动益处的严格理论解释，在保持计算效率的同时提升泛化和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Generalization in deep learning is closely tied to the pursuit of flat minima
in the loss landscape, yet classical Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics
(SGLD) offers no mechanism to bias its dynamics toward such low-curvature
solutions. This work introduces Flatness-Aware Stochastic Gradient Langevin
Dynamics (fSGLD), designed to efficiently and provably seek flat minima in
high-dimensional nonconvex optimization problems. At each iteration, fSGLD uses
the stochastic gradient evaluated at parameters perturbed by isotropic Gaussian
noise, commonly referred to as Random Weight Perturbation (RWP), thereby
optimizing a randomized-smoothing objective that implicitly captures curvature
information. Leveraging these properties, we prove that the invariant measure
of fSGLD stays close to a stationary measure concentrated on the global
minimizers of a loss function regularized by the Hessian trace whenever the
inverse temperature and the scale of random weight perturbation are properly
coupled. This result provides a rigorous theoretical explanation for the
benefits of random weight perturbation. In particular, we establish
non-asymptotic convergence guarantees in Wasserstein distance with the best
known rate and derive an excess-risk bound for the Hessian-trace regularized
objective. Extensive experiments on noisy-label and large-scale vision tasks,
in both training-from-scratch and fine-tuning settings, demonstrate that fSGLD
achieves superior or comparable generalization and robustness to baseline
algorithms while maintaining the computational cost of SGD, about half that of
SAM. Hessian-spectrum analysis further confirms that fSGLD converges to
significantly flatter minima.

Abstract: Inverse Reinforcement Learning aims to recover reward models from expert

difficult to interpret and debug. In this work, we introduce GRACE (Generating
Rewards As CodE), a method for using Large Language Models within an
evolutionary search to reverse-engineer an interpretable, code-based reward
function directly from expert trajectories. The resulting reward function is
executable code that can be inspected and verified. We empirically validate
GRACE on the BabyAI and AndroidWorld benchmarks, where it efficiently learns
highly accurate rewards, even in complex, multi-task settings. Further, we
demonstrate that the resulting reward leads to strong policies, compared to
both competitive Imitation Learning and online RL approaches with ground-truth
rewards. Finally, we show that GRACE is able to build complex reward APIs in
multi-task setups.

results: This Challenge provides multiple innovations. First, we leveraged
several datasets with labels from patient reports and serological testing,
provided a large dataset with weak labels and smaller datasets with strong

Conclusion: Poolformer为长序列处理提供了高效解决方案，深度层处理长程依赖，浅层处理短期特征。未来可扩展到文本、视觉和多模态应用。

Abstract: Sequence-to-sequence models have become central in Artificial Intelligence,
particularly following the introduction of the transformer architecture. While
initially developed for Natural Language Processing, these models have
demonstrated utility across domains, including Computer Vision. Such models
require mechanisms to exchange information along the time dimension, typically
using recurrent or self-attention layers. However, self-attention scales
quadratically with sequence length, limiting its practicality for very long
sequences.
  We introduce Poolformer, a sequence-to-sequence model that replaces
self-attention with recurrent layers and incorporates pooling operations to
reduce sequence length. Poolformer is defined recursively using SkipBlocks,
which contain residual blocks, a down-pooling layer, a nested SkipBlock, an
up-pooling layer, and additional residual blocks. We conduct extensive
experiments to support our architectural choices.
  Our results show that pooling greatly accelerates training, improves
perceptual metrics (FID and IS), and prevents overfitting. Our experiments also
suggest that long-range dependencies are handled by deep layers, while shallow
layers take care of short-term features.
  Evaluated on raw audio, which naturally features long sequence lengths,
Poolformer outperforms state-of-the-art models such as SaShiMi and Mamba.
Future directions include applications to text and vision, as well as
multi-modal scenarios, where a Poolformer-based LLM could effectively process
dense representations of images and videos.

TL;DR: StockBench是一个评估LLM代理在股票交易中表现的基准测试，通过多个月的模拟交易环境测试模型的风险管理和收益能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有金融基准主要测试静态知识问答，无法捕捉交易的动态迭代特性，金融领域的高风险决策价值需要专门的LLM代理评估工具。

Method: 构建无污染基准，让LLM代理接收每日市场信号（价格、基本面、新闻），做出买卖持有决策，使用累计收益、最大回撤、索提诺比率等金融指标评估。

Result: 大多数LLM代理难以超越简单的买入持有策略，但部分模型显示出获得更高收益和更好风险管理的能力。

Conclusion: 静态金融知识能力不一定能转化为成功的交易策略，StockBench作为开源资源支持该领域的研究发展。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated strong capabilities
as autonomous agents, showing promise in reasoning, tool use, and sequential
decision-making. While prior benchmarks have evaluated LLM agents in domains
such as software engineering and scientific discovery, the finance domain
remains underexplored, despite its direct relevance to economic value and
high-stakes decision-making. Existing financial benchmarks primarily test
static knowledge through question answering, but they fall short of capturing
the dynamic and iterative nature of trading. To address this gap, we introduce
StockBench, a contamination-free benchmark designed to evaluate LLM agents in
realistic, multi-month stock trading environments. Agents receive daily market
signals -- including prices, fundamentals, and news -- and must make sequential
buy, sell, or hold decisions. Performance is assessed using financial metrics
such as cumulative return, maximum drawdown, and the Sortino ratio. Our
evaluation of state-of-the-art proprietary (e.g., GPT-5, Claude-4) and
open-weight (e.g., Qwen3, Kimi-K2, GLM-4.5) models shows that while most LLM
agents struggle to outperform the simple buy-and-hold baseline, several models
demonstrate the potential to deliver higher returns and manage risk more
effectively. These findings highlight both the challenges and opportunities in
developing LLM-powered financial agents, showing that excelling at static
financial knowledge tasks does not necessarily translate into successful
trading strategies. We release StockBench as an open-source resource to support
reproducibility and advance future research in this domain.

TL;DR: DiFFPO是一个统一的训练框架，通过强化学习训练掩码扩散大语言模型，使其推理能力更强、速度更快。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如d1在训练扩散大语言模型时存在似然计算困难的问题，需要更有效的训练框架来同时提升推理质量和效率。

Method: 提出两阶段似然近似结合重要性采样校正的强化学习算法，并联合训练高效采样器/控制器，让模型自适应地为每个提示分配推理阈值。

Result: 在数学和规划基准任务上训练开源大扩散语言模型，获得了更好的准确性和更低的函数评估次数，提升了推理计算效率的帕累托前沿。

Conclusion: DiFFPO框架通过联合训练模型和采样器，在保持高质量推理的同时显著提升了推理速度，为扩散语言模型的训练提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We propose DiFFPO, Diffusion Fast and Furious Policy Optimization, a unified
framework for training masked diffusion large language models (dLLMs) to reason
not only better (furious), but also faster via reinforcement learning (RL). We
first unify the existing baseline approach such as d1 by proposing to train
surrogate policies via off-policy RL, whose likelihood is much more tractable
as an approximation to the true dLLM policy. This naturally motivates a more
accurate and informative two-stage likelihood approximation combined with
importance sampling correction, which leads to generalized RL algorithms with
better sample efficiency and superior task performance. Second, we propose a
new direction of joint training efficient samplers/controllers of dLLMs policy.
Via RL, we incentivize dLLMs' natural multi-token prediction capabilities by
letting the model learn to adaptively allocate an inference threshold for each
prompt. By jointly training the sampler, we yield better accuracies with lower
number of function evaluations (NFEs) compared to training the model only,
obtaining the best performance in improving the Pareto frontier of the
inference-time compute of dLLMs. We showcase the effectiveness of our pipeline
by training open source large diffusion language models over benchmark math and
planning tasks.

TL;DR: 提出C2AL方法，通过分析数据子结构并利用部分冲突的辅助标签来正则化共享表示，解决推荐模型中因数据异质性导致的注意力机制失效问题，在保持少数群体信息的同时提升全局性能。


<details>

Motivation: 现实世界数据由异质群体组成，但大规模推荐模型的单一全局目标假设数据同质化。随着模型规模和复杂度增加，模型会偏向主导分布模式，忽视头尾区域，导致注意力权重失效或神经元死亡。

Method: 分析数据集子结构，通过具有强分布对比的辅助学习来暴露这些结构。利用部分冲突的辅助标签正则化共享表示，定制注意力层学习过程以保持与少数群体的互信息。

Result: 在包含数十亿数据点的生产数据集上评估六个SOTA模型，因子分解机能够使用该方法捕获细粒度用户-广告交互，整体归一化熵降低达0.16%，在目标少数群体上收益超过0.30%。

Conclusion: C2AL方法通过辅助学习有效解决了推荐模型中的异质性问题，在保持少数群体信息的同时显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Training large-scale recommendation models under a single global objective
implicitly assumes homogeneity across user populations. However, real-world
data are composites of heterogeneous cohorts with distinct conditional
distributions. As models increase in scale and complexity and as more data is
used for training, they become dominated by central distribution patterns,
neglecting head and tail regions. This imbalance limits the model's learning
ability and can result in inactive attention weights or dead neurons. In this
paper, we reveal how the attention mechanism can play a key role in
factorization machines for shared embedding selection, and propose to address
this challenge by analyzing the substructures in the dataset and exposing those
with strong distributional contrast through auxiliary learning. Unlike previous
research, which heuristically applies weighted labels or multi-task heads to
mitigate such biases, we leverage partially conflicting auxiliary labels to
regularize the shared representation. This approach customizes the learning
process of attention layers to preserve mutual information with minority
cohorts while improving global performance. We evaluated C2AL on massive
production datasets with billions of data points each for six SOTA models.
Experiments show that the factorization machine is able to capture fine-grained
user-ad interactions using the proposed method, achieving up to a 0.16%
reduction in normalized entropy overall and delivering gains exceeding 0.30% on
targeted minority cohorts.

Abstract: Imputation methods play a critical role in enhancing the quality of practical
time-series data, which often suffer from pervasive missing values. Recently,
diffusion-based generative imputation methods have demonstrated remarkable
success compared to autoregressive and conventional statistical approaches.
Despite their empirical success, the theoretical understanding of how well
diffusion-based models capture complex spatial and temporal dependencies
between the missing values and observed ones remains limited. Our work
addresses this gap by investigating the statistical efficiency of conditional
diffusion transformers for imputation and quantifying the uncertainty in
missing values. Specifically, we derive statistical sample complexity bounds
based on a novel approximation theory for conditional score functions using
transformers, and, through this, construct tight confidence regions for missing
values. Our findings also reveal that the efficiency and accuracy of imputation
are significantly influenced by the missing patterns. Furthermore, we validate
these theoretical insights through simulation and propose a mixed-masking
training strategy to enhance the imputation performance.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于copula的方法，从现有的多步时间序列基础模型中高效生成准确、相关的样本路径，避免了自回归采样的高计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时间序列基础模型只能预测每个时间步的独立边际分布，而非完整的联合预测分布。为了生成具有现实相关结构的预测样本路径，通常需要昂贵的自回归采样。

Method: 采用copula方法，通过一次前向传递从现有的多步时间序列基础模型生成相关的样本路径。

Result: copula方法生成相关样本路径的速度比自回归采样快几个数量级，并通过减轻误差累积现象提高了样本路径质量。

Conclusion: copula方法为多步时间序列预测提供了一种高效且准确的样本路径生成方案，显著优于传统的自回归采样方法。

Abstract: Many time series applications require access to multi-step forecast
trajectories in the form of sample paths. Recently, time series foundation
models have leveraged multi-step lookahead predictions to improve the quality
and efficiency of multi-step forecasts. However, these models only predict
independent marginal distributions for each time step, rather than a full joint
predictive distribution. To generate forecast sample paths with realistic
correlation structures, one typically resorts to autoregressive sampling, which
can be extremely expensive. In this paper, we present a copula-based approach
to efficiently generate accurate, correlated sample paths from existing
multi-step time series foundation models in one forward pass. Our copula-based
approach generates correlated sample paths orders of magnitude faster than
autoregressive sampling, and it yields improved sample path quality by
mitigating the snowballing error phenomenon.

TL;DR: 比较Transformer和xLSTM的扩展规律，发现xLSTM在典型LLM训练和推理场景中表现更优，且随着上下文长度增加优势更明显


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然Transformer是主流架构，但xLSTM等替代方案在线性复杂度和十亿参数规模下具有竞争力，需要研究两者的扩展行为差异

Method: 在80M-7B模型规模和2B-2T训练token范围内，使用IsoFLOP和参数拟合方法研究xLSTM在计算最优和过训练机制下的扩展行为；分析最优模型大小对上下文长度的依赖性；研究推理时扩展特性

Result: xLSTM在典型LLM训练和推理场景中比Transformer扩展更有利，且随着训练和推理上下文增长，xLSTM的优势更加明显

Conclusion: xLSTM在扩展性方面优于Transformer，特别是在长上下文场景下，这为未来模型设计和部署提供了重要指导

Abstract: Scaling laws play a central role in the success of Large Language Models
(LLMs), enabling the prediction of model performance relative to compute
budgets prior to training. While Transformers have been the dominant
architecture, recent alternatives such as xLSTM offer linear complexity with
respect to context length while remaining competitive in the billion-parameter
regime. We conduct a comparative investigation on the scaling behavior of
Transformers and xLSTM along the following lines, providing insights to guide
future model design and deployment. First, we study the scaling behavior for
xLSTM in compute-optimal and over-training regimes using both IsoFLOP and
parametric fit approaches on a wide range of model sizes (80M-7B) and number of
training tokens (2B-2T). Second, we examine the dependence of optimal model
sizes on context length, a pivotal aspect that was largely ignored in previous
work. Finally, we analyze inference-time scaling characteristics. Our findings
reveal that in typical LLM training and inference scenarios, xLSTM scales
favorably compared to Transformers. Importantly, xLSTM's advantage widens as
training and inference contexts grow.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于正未标记学习（PUL）的异常检测方案PUL-Inter-Slice Defender，用于防御5G网络中的分布式切片移动性（DSM）攻击，该方案结合LSTM自编码器和K-Means聚类，在训练数据被污染的情况下仍能保持高检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 5G网络中用户设备可以在多个网络切片间无缝切换，这种灵活性引入了分布式切片移动性（DSM）攻击的潜在漏洞，这是一种分布式拒绝服务（DDoS）攻击形式。

Method: 采用正未标记学习（PUL）方法，结合长短期记忆自编码器和K-Means聚类，利用3GPP关键性能指标和性能测量计数器作为机器学习模型的特征。

Result: 在基于free5GC和UERANSIM的5G测试床数据上评估，当训练数据包含10%到40%攻击污染时，PUL-Inter-Slice Defender的F1分数超过98.50%，优于对比方案。

Conclusion: PUL-Inter-Slice Defender能够有效检测DSM攻击变种，在训练数据被污染的情况下仍保持鲁棒性，为5G网络切片安全提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Network Slices (NSs) are virtual networks operating over a shared physical
infrastructure, each designed to meet specific application requirements while
maintaining consistent Quality of Service (QoS). In Fifth Generation (5G)
networks, User Equipment (UE) can connect to and seamlessly switch between
multiple NSs to access diverse services. However, this flexibility, known as
Inter-Slice Switching (ISS), introduces a potential vulnerability that can be
exploited to launch Distributed Slice Mobility (DSM) attacks, a form of
Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack. To secure 5G networks and their
NSs against DSM attacks, we present in this work, PUL-Inter-Slice Defender; an
anomaly detection solution that leverages Positive Unlabeled Learning (PUL) and
incorporates a combination of Long Short-Term Memory Autoencoders and K-Means
clustering. PUL-Inter-Slice Defender leverages the Third Generation Partnership
Project (3GPP) key performance indicators and performance measurement counters
as features for its machine learning models to detect DSM attack variants while
maintaining robustness in the presence of contaminated training data. When
evaluated on data collected from our 5G testbed based on the open-source
free5GC and UERANSIM, a UE/ Radio Access Network (RAN) simulator;
PUL-Inter-Slice Defender achieved F1-scores exceeding 98.50% on training
datasets with 10% to 40% attack contamination, consistently outperforming its
counterpart Inter-Slice Defender and other PUL based solutions combining
One-Class Support Vector Machine (OCSVM) with Random Forest and XGBoost.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战传统深度学习优化中每步更新所有层的假设，认为全网络更新在理论和实践上都是次优的，寻求更高效的训练方法。

Method: 提出Drop-Muon框架，每步仅按随机调度更新层子集，结合渐进式训练效率和层特定非欧几里得更新。

Result: 在CNN实验中，Drop-Muon始终优于全网络Muon，达到相同精度时wall-clock时间快1.4倍，并提供了严格的收敛保证。

Conclusion: 全网络更新并非最优，除非层平滑常数满足特定关系，Drop-Muon为大规模模型训练提供了理论依据的高效替代方案。

Abstract: Conventional wisdom in deep learning optimization dictates updating all
layers at every step-a principle followed by all recent state-of-the-art
optimizers such as Muon. In this work, we challenge this assumption, showing
that full-network updates can be fundamentally suboptimal, both in theory and
in practice. We introduce a non-Euclidean Randomized Progressive Training
method-Drop-Muon-a simple yet powerful framework that updates only a subset of
layers per step according to a randomized schedule, combining the efficiency of
progressive training with layer-specific non-Euclidean updates for top-tier
performance. We provide rigorous convergence guarantees under both layer-wise
smoothness and layer-wise $(L^0, L^1)$-smoothness, covering deterministic and
stochastic gradient settings, marking the first such results for progressive
training in the stochastic and non-smooth regime. Our cost analysis further
reveals that full-network updates are not optimal unless a very specific
relationship between layer smoothness constants holds. Through controlled CNN
experiments, we empirically demonstrate that Drop-Muon consistently outperforms
full-network Muon, achieving the same accuracy up to $1.4\times$ faster in
wall-clock time. Together, our results suggest a shift in how large-scale
models can be efficiently trained, challenging the status quo and offering a
highly efficient, theoretically grounded alternative to full-network updates.

Motivation: 标准在线策略训练在单次更新后丢弃经验数据，导致计算效率低下和训练不稳定，而经验特性对大型推理模型学习动态的影响尚未充分探索

Method: 识别推理经验的价值指标（正确性和熵），提出ExGRPO框架，通过经验组织、优先级排序和混合策略目标来平衡探索与经验利用

Result: 在5个骨干模型（1.5B-8B参数）上，ExGRPO在数学/通用基准上平均提升3.5/7.6分，并在强/弱模型上都能稳定训练

Conclusion: 原则性经验管理是高效可扩展RLVR的关键要素，ExGRPO通过经验价值识别和优化框架显著提升了推理性能

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards (RLVR) is an emerging paradigm
for improving the reasoning ability of large language models. However, standard
on-policy training discards rollout experiences after a single update, leading
to computational inefficiency and instability. While prior work on RL has
highlighted the benefits of reusing past experience, the role of experience
characteristics in shaping learning dynamics of large reasoning models remains
underexplored. In this paper, we are the first to investigate what makes a
reasoning experience valuable and identify rollout correctness and entropy as
effective indicators of experience value. Based on these insights, we propose
ExGRPO (Experiential Group Relative Policy Optimization), a framework that
organizes and prioritizes valuable experiences, and employs a mixed-policy
objective to balance exploration with experience exploitation. Experiments on
five backbone models (1.5B-8B parameters) show that ExGRPO consistently
improves reasoning performance on mathematical/general benchmarks, with an
average gain of +3.5/7.6 points over on-policy RLVR. Moreover, ExGRPO
stabilizes training on both stronger and weaker models where on-policy methods
fail. These results highlight principled experience management as a key
ingredient for efficient and scalable RLVR.

Conclusion: Transformer能够自适应地学习GNN的有利特性，挑战了硬编码图归纳偏置的必要性，为分子建模提供了标准化、可扩展的架构方向。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are the dominant architecture for molecular
machine learning, particularly for molecular property prediction and machine
learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs). GNNs perform message passing on
predefined graphs often induced by a fixed radius cutoff or k-nearest neighbor
scheme. While this design aligns with the locality present in many molecular
tasks, a hard-coded graph can limit expressivity due to the fixed receptive
field and slows down inference with sparse graph operations. In this work, we
investigate whether pure, unmodified Transformers trained directly on Cartesian
coordinates$\unicode{x2013}$without predefined graphs or physical
priors$\unicode{x2013}$can approximate molecular energies and forces. As a
starting point for our analysis, we demonstrate how to train a Transformer to
competitive energy and force mean absolute errors under a matched training
compute budget, relative to a state-of-the-art equivariant GNN on the OMol25
dataset. We discover that the Transformer learns physically consistent
patterns$\unicode{x2013}$such as attention weights that decay inversely with
interatomic distance$\unicode{x2013}$and flexibly adapts them across different
molecular environments due to the absence of hard-coded biases. The use of a
standard Transformer also unlocks predictable improvements with respect to
scaling training resources, consistent with empirical scaling laws observed in
other domains. Our results demonstrate that many favorable properties of GNNs
can emerge adaptively in Transformers, challenging the necessity of hard-coded
graph inductive biases and pointing toward standardized, scalable architectures
for molecular modeling.

Motivation: 解决反应式干扰问题，干扰者采用动态策略选择信道和感知阈值来检测和干扰传输，需要学习避免干扰并优化吞吐量。

Method: 使用Q-learning处理离散干扰事件状态，使用深度Q网络(DQN)处理基于接收功率的连续状态，通过不同的奖励函数和动作集进行学习。

Result: 强化学习能够快速适应频谱动态变化，在信道和干扰策略随时间变化时维持高传输速率。

Conclusion: 强化学习是应对动态干扰策略的有效方法，能够自适应优化通信性能。

Abstract: This paper studies the problem of mitigating reactive jamming, where a jammer
adopts a dynamic policy of selecting channels and sensing thresholds to detect
and jam ongoing transmissions. The transmitter-receiver pair learns to avoid
jamming and optimize throughput over time (without prior knowledge of channel
conditions or jamming strategies) by using reinforcement learning (RL) to adapt
transmit power, modulation, and channel selection. Q-learning is employed for
discrete jamming-event states, while Deep Q-Networks (DQN) are employed for
continuous states based on received power. Through different reward functions
and action sets, the results show that RL can adapt rapidly to spectrum
dynamics and sustain high rates as channels and jamming policies change over
time.

Motivation: RF信号传播建模对于环境理解和无线网络优化至关重要，但复杂环境中的准确预测仍具挑战性，因为信号会受到障碍物的吸收和反射等影响。

Method: 提出RF-3D编码器从3D点云数据中提取RF相关特征，采用多尺度嵌入模拟实际RF信号传播过程，基于扩散模型进行信号预测。

Conclusion: Diffusion^2代表了RF信号传播建模领域的重大进展，能够高效准确地预测复杂环境中的RF信号行为。

Abstract: Modeling radio frequency (RF) signal propagation is essential for
understanding the environment, as RF signals offer valuable insights beyond the
capabilities of RGB cameras, which are limited by the visible-light spectrum,
lens coverage, and occlusions. It is also useful for supporting wireless
diagnosis, deployment, and optimization. However, accurately predicting RF
signals in complex environments remains a challenge due to interactions with
obstacles such as absorption and reflection. We introduce Diffusion^2, a
diffusion-based approach that uses 3D point clouds to model the propagation of
RF signals across a wide range of frequencies, from Wi-Fi to millimeter waves.
To effectively capture RF-related features from 3D data, we present the RF-3D
Encoder, which encapsulates the complexities of 3D geometry along with
signal-specific details. These features undergo multi-scale embedding to
simulate the actual RF signal dissemination process. Our evaluation, based on
synthetic and real-world measurements, demonstrates that Diffusion^2 accurately
estimates the behavior of RF signals in various frequency bands and
environmental conditions, with an error margin of just 1.9 dB and 27x faster
than existing methods, marking a significant advancement in the field. Refer to

Abstract: Traffic forecasting on road networks is a complex task of significant
practical importance that has recently attracted considerable attention from
the machine learning community, with spatiotemporal graph neural networks
(GNNs) becoming the most popular approach. The proper evaluation of traffic
forecasting methods requires realistic datasets, but current publicly available
benchmarks have significant drawbacks, including the absence of information
about road connectivity for road graph construction, limited information about
road properties, and a relatively small number of road segments that falls
short of real-world applications. Further, current datasets mostly contain
information about intercity highways with sparsely located sensors, while city
road networks arguably present a more challenging forecasting task due to much
denser roads and more complex urban traffic patterns. In this work, we provide
a more complete, realistic, and challenging benchmark for traffic forecasting
by releasing datasets representing the road networks of two major cities, with
the largest containing almost 100,000 road segments (more than a 10-fold
increase relative to existing datasets). Our datasets contain rich road
features and provide fine-grained data about both traffic volume and traffic
speed, allowing for building more holistic traffic forecasting systems. We show
that most current implementations of neural spatiotemporal models for traffic
forecasting have problems scaling to datasets of our size. To overcome this
issue, we propose an alternative approach to neural traffic forecasting that
uses a GNN without a dedicated module for temporal sequence processing, thus
achieving much better scalability, while also demonstrating stronger
forecasting performance. We hope our datasets and modeling insights will serve
as a valuable resource for research in traffic forecasting.

Abstract: Hallucinations are a common issue that undermine the reliability of large
language models (LLMs). Recent studies have identified a specific subset of
hallucinations, known as confabulations, which arise due to predictive
uncertainty of LLMs. To detect confabulations, various methods for estimating
predictive uncertainty in natural language generation (NLG) have been
developed. These methods are typically evaluated by correlating uncertainty
estimates with the correctness of generated text, with question-answering (QA)
datasets serving as the standard benchmark. However, commonly used approximate
correctness functions have substantial disagreement between each other and,
consequently, in the ranking of the uncertainty estimation methods. This allows
one to inflate the apparent performance of uncertainty estimation methods. We
propose using several alternative risk indicators for risk correlation
experiments that improve robustness of empirical assessment of UE algorithms
for NLG. For QA tasks, we show that marginalizing over multiple LLM-as-a-judge
variants leads to reducing the evaluation biases. Furthermore, we explore
structured tasks as well as out of distribution and perturbation detection
tasks which provide robust and controllable risk indicators. Finally, we
propose to use an Elo rating of uncertainty estimation methods to give an
objective summarization over extensive evaluation settings.

TL;DR: 提出了DialTree-RPO框架，通过强化学习和树搜索自主发现多样化的多轮攻击策略，在10个目标模型上比现有方法攻击成功率提升25.9%以上。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型在多轮交互场景下仍易受对抗攻击，现有方法主要依赖人工红队测试或预定义模板，未能充分探索多轮攻击的广阔空间，而研究表明LLM对多轮攻击的脆弱性显著高于单轮攻击。

Method: 提出DialTree-RPO框架，将对话视为顺序决策问题，结合策略强化学习和树搜索，无需人工标注数据即可系统性地探索多轮攻击策略。

Result: 在10个目标模型上，攻击成功率比现有最优方法提升25.9%以上，并有效发现了新的攻击策略。

Conclusion: DialTree-RPO能够自主发现有效的多轮攻击策略，显著提升攻击成功率，揭示了LLM在多轮交互中的安全脆弱性。

Abstract: Despite recent rapid progress in AI safety, current large language models
remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks in multi-turn interaction settings,
where attackers strategically adapt their prompts across conversation turns and
pose a more critical yet realistic challenge. Existing approaches that discover
safety vulnerabilities either rely on manual red-teaming with human experts or
employ automated methods using pre-defined templates and human-curated attack
data, with most focusing on single-turn attacks. However, these methods did not
explore the vast space of possible multi-turn attacks, failing to consider
novel attack trajectories that emerge from complex dialogue dynamics and
strategic conversation planning. This gap is particularly critical given recent
findings that LLMs exhibit significantly higher vulnerability to multi-turn
attacks compared to single-turn attacks. We propose DialTree-RPO, an on-policy
reinforcement learning framework integrated with tree search that autonomously
discovers diverse multi-turn attack strategies by treating the dialogue as a
sequential decision-making problem, enabling systematic exploration without
manually curated data. Through extensive experiments, our approach not only
achieves more than 25.9% higher ASR across 10 target models compared to
previous state-of-the-art approaches, but also effectively uncovers new attack
strategies by learning optimal dialogue policies that maximize attack success
across multiple turns.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统神经网络训练采用固定的优化方案，缺乏对训练不稳定或问题的动态响应能力。

Method: 使用控制服务器作为用户/代理与训练过程之间的中介，支持动态调整优化器超参数、训练数据和模型检查点。

Result: 通过三个案例研究证明，该框架实现了更好的训练稳定性、降低了对初始超参数的敏感性，并提高了对用户需求变化的适应性。

Conclusion: 为未来AI代理自主监控训练日志、主动解决不稳定问题和优化训练动态的训练范式铺平了道路。

Abstract: Traditional neural network training typically follows fixed, predefined
optimization recipes, lacking the flexibility to dynamically respond to
instabilities or emerging training issues. In this paper, we introduce
Interactive Training, an open-source framework that enables real-time,
feedback-driven intervention during neural network training by human experts or
automated AI agents. At its core, Interactive Training uses a control server to
mediate communication between users or agents and the ongoing training process,
allowing users to dynamically adjust optimizer hyperparameters, training data,
and model checkpoints. Through three case studies, we demonstrate that
Interactive Training achieves superior training stability, reduced sensitivity
to initial hyperparameters, and improved adaptability to evolving user needs,
paving the way toward a future training paradigm where AI agents autonomously
monitor training logs, proactively resolve instabilities, and optimize training
dynamics.

Abstract: We propose the task of knowledge distillation detection, which aims to
determine whether a student model has been distilled from a given teacher,
under a practical setting where only the student's weights and the teacher's
API are available. This problem is motivated by growing concerns about model
provenance and unauthorized replication through distillation. To address this
task, we introduce a model-agnostic framework that combines data-free input
synthesis and statistical score computation for detecting distillation. Our
approach is applicable to both classification and generative models.
Experiments on diverse architectures for image classification and text-to-image
generation show that our method improves detection accuracy over the strongest
baselines by 59.6% on CIFAR-10, 71.2% on ImageNet, and 20.0% for text-to-image
generation. The code is available at

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating
remarkable generalisation capabilities across diverse domains. However, the
mechanisms underpinning these strong capabilities remain only partially
understood. A leading conjecture, based on the manifold hypothesis, attributes
this success to their ability to adapt to low-dimensional geometric structure
within the data. This work provides evidence for this conjecture, focusing on
how such phenomena could result from the formulation of the learning problem
through score matching. We inspect the role of implicit regularisation by
investigating the effect of smoothing minimisers of the empirical score
matching objective. Our theoretical and empirical results confirm that
smoothing the score function -- or equivalently, smoothing in the log-density
domain -- produces smoothing tangential to the data manifold. In addition, we
show that the manifold along which the diffusion model generalises can be
controlled by choosing an appropriate smoothing.

TL;DR: 提出LEGO方法，利用图拉普拉斯低频特征向量的全局结构来指导局部切空间估计，相比传统LPCA方法在噪声环境下更鲁棒。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统局部主成分分析(LPCA)在高噪声环境下存在邻域大小选择的权衡问题，需要先验的几何和噪声特性知识，而这些信息通常不可得。

Method: LEGO方法通过正交化图拉普拉斯低频特征向量的梯度来估计每个数据点的切空间，利用数据的全局结构而非仅依赖局部邻域。

Result: 理论分析表明低频拉普拉斯特征函数梯度与流形切丛对齐良好，且对亚高斯噪声具有鲁棒性。实验证明LEGO比LPCA在噪声环境下显著更鲁棒。

Conclusion: LEGO方法通过利用全局结构信息，在噪声环境下提供了更准确的切空间估计，在流形学习、边界检测和局部本征维度估计等下游任务中表现优异。

Abstract: Estimating the tangent spaces of a data manifold is a fundamental problem in
data analysis. The standard approach, Local Principal Component Analysis
(LPCA), struggles in high-noise settings due to a critical trade-off in
choosing the neighborhood size. Selecting an optimal size requires prior
knowledge of the geometric and noise characteristics of the data that are often
unavailable. In this paper, we propose a spectral method, Laplacian Eigenvector
Gradient Orthogonalization (LEGO), that utilizes the global structure of the
data to guide local tangent space estimation. Instead of relying solely on
local neighborhoods, LEGO estimates the tangent space at each data point by
orthogonalizing the gradients of low-frequency eigenvectors of the graph
Laplacian. We provide two theoretical justifications of our method. First, a
differential geometric analysis on a tubular neighborhood of a manifold shows
that gradients of the low-frequency Laplacian eigenfunctions of the tube align
closely with the manifold's tangent bundle, while an eigenfunction with high
gradient in directions orthogonal to the manifold lie deeper in the spectrum.
Second, a random matrix theoretic analysis also demonstrates that low-frequency
eigenvectors are robust to sub-Gaussian noise. Through comprehensive
experiments, we demonstrate that LEGO yields tangent space estimates that are
significantly more robust to noise than those from LPCA, resulting in marked
improvements in downstream tasks such as manifold learning, boundary detection,
and local intrinsic dimension estimation.

TL;DR: KaVa框架通过从教师模型的压缩KV缓存中蒸馏知识到潜在推理学生模型，解决了显式思维链推理的计算成本高和潜在推理缺乏监督的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 显式思维链推理计算成本高且包含冗余信息，而潜在推理缺乏有效监督，在复杂自然语言推理任务中效果有限。需要一种方法结合显式推理的准确性和潜在推理的效率。

Method: 提出KaVa框架，通过自蒸馏将教师模型压缩KV缓存中的知识蒸馏到潜在推理学生模型，利用连续潜在令牌的表示灵活性对齐步骤间的KV轨迹。

Result: KaVa在潜在推理基准上持续优于强基线，从纯方程到自然语言推理的退化显著减小，能扩展到更大骨干网络同时保持效率。

Conclusion: 压缩KV缓存蒸馏为潜在推理提供了可扩展的监督信号，结合了CoT训练教师的准确性和潜在推理的效率与可部署性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at multi-step reasoning problems with
explicit chain-of-thought (CoT), but verbose traces incur significant
computational costs and memory overhead, and often carry redundant, stylistic
artifacts. Latent reasoning has emerged as an efficient alternative that
internalizes the thought process, but it suffers from a critical lack of
supervision, limiting its effectiveness on complex, natural-language reasoning
traces. In this work, we propose KaVa, the first framework that bridges this
gap by distilling knowledge directly from a compressed KV-cache of the teacher
into a latent-reasoning student via self-distillation, leveraging the
representational flexibility of continuous latent tokens to align stepwise KV
trajectories. We show that the abstract, unstructured knowledge within
compressed KV-cache, which lacks direct token correspondence, can serve as a
rich supervisory signal for a latent reasoning student. Empirically, the
approach consistently outperforms strong latent baselines, exhibits markedly
smaller degradation from equation-only to natural-language traces, and scales
to larger backbones while preserving efficiency. These results establish
compressed KV-cache distillation as a scalable supervision signal for latent
reasoning, combining the accuracy of CoT-trained teachers with the efficiency
and deployability of latent inference.
