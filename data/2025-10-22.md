### [1] [MAT-Agent: Adaptive Multi-Agent Training Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17845)
*Jusheng Zhang,Kaitong Cai,Yijia Fan,Ningyuan Liu,Keze Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出MAT-Agent多智能体框架，通过动态调优数据增强、优化器、学习率和损失函数，实现多标签图像分类的自适应训练，在多个数据集上取得优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多标签图像分类方法采用静态配置，在动态环境中表现不佳，需要自适应训练策略来应对复杂的视觉语义场景变化。

Method: 使用多智能体框架，部署自主智能体动态调优训练参数，采用非平稳多臂老虎机算法平衡探索与利用，结合双速率指数移动平均平滑和混合精度训练确保鲁棒性和效率。

Result: 在Pascal VOC上mAP达97.4，OF1为92.3，CF1为91.4；在COCO上mAP达92.8，OF1为88.2，CF1为87.1；在VG-256上mAP达60.9，OF1为70.8，CF1为61.1，均优于基线方法。

Conclusion: MAT-Agent通过加速收敛和强大的跨域泛化能力，为优化复杂视觉模型提供了可扩展的智能解决方案，推动了自适应深度学习的发展。

Abstract: Multi-label image classification demands adaptive training strategies to
navigate complex, evolving visual-semantic landscapes, yet conventional methods
rely on static configurations that falter in dynamic settings. We propose
MAT-Agent, a novel multi-agent framework that reimagines training as a
collaborative, real-time optimization process. By deploying autonomous agents
to dynamically tune data augmentation, optimizers, learning rates, and loss
functions, MAT-Agent leverages non-stationary multi-armed bandit algorithms to
balance exploration and exploitation, guided by a composite reward harmonizing
accuracy, rare-class performance, and training stability. Enhanced with
dual-rate exponential moving average smoothing and mixed-precision training, it
ensures robustness and efficiency. Extensive experiments across Pascal VOC,
COCO, and VG-256 demonstrate MAT-Agent's superiority: it achieves an mAP of
97.4 (vs. 96.2 for PAT-T), OF1 of 92.3, and CF1 of 91.4 on Pascal VOC; an mAP
of 92.8 (vs. 92.0 for HSQ-CvN), OF1 of 88.2, and CF1 of 87.1 on COCO; and an
mAP of 60.9, OF1 of 70.8, and CF1 of 61.1 on VG-256. With accelerated
convergence and robust cross-domain generalization, MAT-Agent offers a
scalable, intelligent solution for optimizing complex visual models, paving the
way for adaptive deep learning advancements.

### [2] [CoIDO: Efficient Data Selection for Visual Instruction Tuning via Coupled Importance-Diversity Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17847)
*Yichen Yan,Ming Zhong,Qi Zhu,Xiaoling Gu,Jinpeng Chen,Huan Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoIDO是一个新颖的双目标框架，通过联合优化数据重要性和多样性来解决MLLMs指令调优中的计算瓶颈问题，仅使用20%数据训练轻量级评分器，就能在10个下游任务中达到全数据微调98.2%的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型指令调优需要大量计算成本，现有数据选择方法存在计算开销高和重要性、多样性分离处理的缺点。

Method: 提出CoIDO框架，使用轻量级插件评分器在小规模随机样本上训练，学习候选集分布，通过同方差不确定性公式平衡重要性和多样性。

Result: 仅使用20%随机数据训练CoIDO评分器，然后在全数据集上选择20%子集进行指令调优，在LLaVA-1.5-7B模型上达到全数据微调98.2%的平均性能。

Conclusion: CoIDO框架能显著降低计算成本，同时保持高性能，为大规模多模态模型训练提供了高效的数据选择解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) rely heavily on instruction tuning
to align vision and language capabilities, yet the computational cost of
training on large-scale datasets remains a major bottleneck. Existing data
selection methods aim to mitigate this by selecting important and diverse
subsets, but they often suffer from two critical drawbacks: high computational
overhead from processing the entire dataset and suboptimal data selection due
to separate treatment of importance and diversity.
  We introduce CoIDO, a novel dual-objective framework that jointly optimizes
data importance and diversity to overcome these challenges. Unlike existing
approaches that require costly evaluations across the whole dataset, CoIDO
employs a lightweight plug-in scorer. This scorer is trained on just a small
random sample of data to learn the distribution of the candidate set,
drastically reducing computational demands. By leveraging a homoscedastic
uncertainty-based formulation, CoIDO effectively balances importance and
diversity during training, enabling efficient and scalable data selection.
  In our experiments, we trained the CoIDO scorer using only 20 percent of
randomly sampled data. Once trained, CoIDO was applied to the entire dataset to
select a 20 percent subset for instruction tuning. On the widely used
LLaVA-1.5-7B model across ten downstream tasks, this selected subset achieved
an impressive 98.2 percent of the performance of full-data fine-tuning, on
average.

### [3] [Pre to Post-Treatment Glioblastoma MRI Prediction using a Latent Diffusion Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17851)
*Alexandre G. Leclercq,Sébastien Bougleux,Noémie N. Moreau,Alexis Desmonts,Romain Hérault,Aurélien Corroyer-Dulmont*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于潜在扩散模型的早期视觉治疗反应预测方法，通过从治疗前MRI生成治疗后MRI来预测胶质母细胞瘤的治疗反应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胶质母细胞瘤患者对治疗反应存在高度异质性，传统方法需要至少两个月才能观察到治疗效果。早期预测治疗反应对于推进个性化医疗至关重要。

Method: 使用潜在扩散模型，结合治疗前MRI和肿瘤定位进行条件化，并采用无分类器指导利用生存信息来增强生成质量。

Result: 模型在包含140名胶质母细胞瘤患者的本地数据集上进行了训练和测试，数据集包括治疗前后T1-Gd MRI、专家手动勾画的肿瘤定位和生存信息。

Conclusion: 该方法能够通过切片到切片的翻译模型早期预测肿瘤演变，为个性化治疗决策提供支持。

Abstract: Glioblastoma (GBM) is an aggressive primary brain tumor with a median
survival of approximately 15 months. In clinical practice, the Stupp protocol
serves as the standard first-line treatment. However, patients exhibit highly
heterogeneous therapeutic responses which required at least two months before
first visual impact can be observed, typically with MRI. Early prediction
treatment response is crucial for advancing personalized medicine. Disease
Progression Modeling (DPM) aims to capture the trajectory of disease evolution,
while Treatment Response Prediction (TRP) focuses on assessing the impact of
therapeutic interventions. Whereas most TRP approaches primarly rely on
timeseries data, we consider the problem of early visual TRP as a
slice-to-slice translation model generating post-treatment MRI from a
pre-treatment MRI, thus reflecting the tumor evolution. To address this problem
we propose a Latent Diffusion Model with a concatenation-based conditioning
from the pre-treatment MRI and the tumor localization, and a classifier-free
guidance to enhance generation quality using survival information, in
particular post-treatment tumor evolution. Our model were trained and tested on
a local dataset consisting of 140 GBM patients collected at Centre Fran\c{c}ois
Baclesse. For each patient we collected pre and post T1-Gd MRI, tumor
localization manually delineated in the pre-treatment MRI by medical experts,
and survival information.

*Jitendra Sharma,Arthur Carvalho,Suman Bhunia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于图像嵌入和向量相似度的AI生成图像检测框架，通过分析嵌入距离来区分AI生成图像和真实图像


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI和大型语言模型的快速发展使得AI生成的图像越来越难以与人类创作区分，这对数字内容认证提出了挑战，需要确保数字数据的完整性和来源真实性

Method: 开发基于图像嵌入和向量相似度的检测系统，使用五个基准嵌入模型处理多样化的AI和人类生成图像数据集，假设AI生成图像在嵌入空间中更接近其他AI生成内容

Result: 实验证明该方法具有鲁棒性，中等到高度扰动对嵌入签名影响最小，扰动图像与原始版本保持高度相似性

Conclusion: 该解决方案提供了一个可泛化的AI生成图像检测框架，在准确性和计算效率之间取得了平衡

Abstract: Rapid advancement in generative AI and large language models (LLMs) has
enabled the generation of highly realistic and contextually relevant digital
content. LLMs such as ChatGPT with DALL-E integration and Stable Diffusion
techniques can produce images that are often indistinguishable from those
created by humans, which poses challenges for digital content authentication.
Verifying the integrity and origin of digital data to ensure it remains
unaltered and genuine is crucial to maintaining trust and legality in digital
media. In this paper, we propose an embedding-based AI image detection
framework that utilizes image embeddings and a vector similarity to distinguish
AI-generated images from real (human-created) ones. Our methodology is built on
the hypothesis that AI-generated images demonstrate closer embedding proximity
to other AI-generated content, while human-created images cluster similarly
within their domain. To validate this hypothesis, we developed a system that
processes a diverse dataset of AI and human-generated images through five
benchmark embedding models. Extensive experimentation demonstrates the
robustness of our approach, and our results confirm that moderate to high
perturbations minimally impact the embedding signatures, with perturbed images
maintaining close similarity matches to their original versions. Our solution
provides a generalizable framework for AI-generated image detection that
balances accuracy with computational efficiency.

### [5] [CMIS-Net: A Cascaded Multi-Scale Individual Standardization Network for Backchannel Agreement Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17855)
*Yuxuan Huang,Kangzhong Wang,Eugene Yujun Fu,Grace Ngai,Peter H. F. Ng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出CMIS-Net网络，通过多尺度个体标准化处理个体差异，结合隐式数据增强解决数据分布偏差，在反馈信号检测中实现最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 反馈信号在对话中至关重要，但个体表达差异显著，现有情感识别方法多局限于单一尺度，无法充分处理多尺度行为线索的互补性。

Method: 提出级联多尺度个体标准化网络(CMIS-Net)，在帧级和序列级提取个体归一化特征，移除个体特定中性基线，并引入隐式数据增强模块。

Result: CMIS-Net有效处理个体差异和数据不平衡，在反馈信号一致性检测中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: 多尺度个体标准化方法能更好地处理个体表达差异，为开发更人性化的AI对话系统提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Backchannels are subtle listener responses, such as nods, smiles, or short
verbal cues like "yes" or "uh-huh," which convey understanding and agreement in
conversations. These signals provide feedback to speakers, improve the
smoothness of interaction, and play a crucial role in developing human-like,
responsive AI systems. However, the expression of backchannel behaviors is
often significantly influenced by individual differences, operating across
multiple scales: from instant dynamics such as response intensity (frame-level)
to temporal patterns such as frequency and rhythm preferences (sequence-level).
This presents a complex pattern recognition problem that contemporary emotion
recognition methods have yet to fully address. Particularly, existing
individualized methods in emotion recognition often operate at a single scale,
overlooking the complementary nature of multi-scale behavioral cues. To address
these challenges, we propose a novel Cascaded Multi-Scale Individual
Standardization Network (CMIS-Net) that extracts individual-normalized
backchannel features by removing person-specific neutral baselines from
observed expressions. Operating at both frame and sequence levels, this
normalization allows model to focus on relative changes from each person's
baseline rather than absolute expression values. Furthermore, we introduce an
implicit data augmentation module to address the observed training data
distributional bias, improving model generalization. Comprehensive experiments
and visualizations demonstrate that CMIS-Net effectively handles individual
differences and data imbalance, achieving state-of-the-art performance in
backchannel agreement detection.

### [6] [Shortcutting Pre-trained Flow Matching Diffusion Models is Almost Free Lunch](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17858)
*Xu Cai,Yang Wu,Qianli Chen,Haoran Wu,Lichuan Xiang,Hongkai Wen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种超高效的后训练方法，通过新颖的速度场自蒸馏技术，将大规模预训练流匹配扩散模型转化为高效的少步采样器，无需重新训练即可实现轨迹跳跃功能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有流匹配模型需要专门步长嵌入才能进行轨迹跳跃的问题，避免从头重新训练的高昂成本。

Method: 基于速度场的自蒸馏方法，无需步长嵌入，通过在线自引导蒸馏快速学习，可在不到一个A100天的训练时间内生成3步Flux模型。

Result: 成功将标准流匹配模型转化为少步采样器，实现了最先进的性能，并且可以仅用10个文本-图像对完成数十亿参数扩散模型的少样本蒸馏。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅提供高效的后训练蒸馏方案，还能整合到预训练阶段本身，产生天生学习高效少步流的模型，且不牺牲质量。

Abstract: We present an ultra-efficient post-training method for shortcutting
large-scale pre-trained flow matching diffusion models into efficient few-step
samplers, enabled by novel velocity field self-distillation. While shortcutting
in flow matching, originally introduced by shortcut models, offers flexible
trajectory-skipping capabilities, it requires a specialized step-size embedding
incompatible with existing models unless retraining from
scratch$\unicode{x2013}$a process nearly as costly as pretraining itself.
  Our key contribution is thus imparting a more aggressive shortcut mechanism
to standard flow matching models (e.g., Flux), leveraging a unique distillation
principle that obviates the need for step-size embedding. Working on the
velocity field rather than sample space and learning rapidly from self-guided
distillation in an online manner, our approach trains efficiently, e.g.,
producing a 3-step Flux less than one A100 day. Beyond distillation, our method
can be incorporated into the pretraining stage itself, yielding models that
inherently learn efficient, few-step flows without compromising quality. This
capability also enables, to our knowledge, the first few-shot distillation
method (e.g., 10 text-image pairs) for dozen-billion-parameter diffusion
models, delivering state-of-the-art performance at almost free cost.

*Demetrious T. Kutzke,Ying-Kun Wu,Elizabeth Terveen,Junaed Sattar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种新颖的混合方法，通过计算机视觉从3D人体关节点生成伪IMU数据，用于水下潜水员异常行为监测，解决传统水下无线信号衰减问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统水下活动识别方法在挑战性水下环境中效果有限，特别是潜水员穿戴传感器与AUV通信时存在无线信号衰减问题，需要一种有效监测潜水员安全的方法。

Method: 利用计算机视觉从3D人体关节点序列生成高保真运动数据，创建"伪IMU"，并集成到AUV上对潜水员异常行为进行分类识别。

Result: 通过在AUV上集成分类器并进行模拟遇险场景实验，证明了该方法在机器人监测和潜水员安全方面的实用性和有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了水下无线通信限制问题，为潜水员安全监测提供了一种有效的计算机视觉替代方案，特别适用于检测如心脏骤停等医疗紧急情况的异常行为。

Abstract: Traditional human activity recognition uses either direct image analysis or
data from wearable inertial measurement units (IMUs), but can be ineffective in
challenging underwater environments. We introduce a novel hybrid approach that
bridges this gap to monitor scuba diver safety. Our method leverages computer
vision to generate high-fidelity motion data, effectively creating a
``pseudo-IMU'' from a stream of 3D human joint keypoints. This technique
circumvents the critical problem of wireless signal attenuation in water, which
plagues conventional diver-worn sensors communicating with an Autonomous
Underwater Vehicle (AUV). We apply this system to the vital task of identifying
anomalous scuba diver behavior that signals the onset of a medical emergency
such as cardiac arrest -- a leading cause of scuba diving fatalities. By
integrating our classifier onboard an AUV and conducting experiments with
simulated distress scenarios, we demonstrate the utility and effectiveness of
our method for advancing robotic monitoring and diver safety.

TL;DR: InsideOut扩展了3D高斯泼溅技术，融合RGB表面细节和X射线内部结构，解决了多模态数据表示差异和配对数据集有限的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RGB和X射线成像的融合在医疗诊断、文化遗产修复和制造业等领域具有重要价值，但存在数据表示差异和配对数据稀缺的挑战。

Method: 收集新的配对RGB和X射线数据，进行分层拟合以对齐RGB和X射线辐射高斯泼溅，并提出X射线参考损失以确保内部结构一致性。

Result: 该方法有效解决了两种模态间数据表示差异和有限配对数据集带来的挑战。

Conclusion: InsideOut显著扩展了3D高斯泼溅技术的应用范围，增强了各个领域的可视化、模拟和无损检测能力。

Abstract: We introduce InsideOut, an extension of 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) that
bridges the gap between high-fidelity RGB surface details and subsurface X-ray
structures. The fusion of RGB and X-ray imaging is invaluable in fields such as
medical diagnostics, cultural heritage restoration, and manufacturing. We
collect new paired RGB and X-ray data, perform hierarchical fitting to align
RGB and X-ray radiative Gaussian splats, and propose an X-ray reference loss to
ensure consistent internal structures. InsideOut effectively addresses the
challenges posed by disparate data representations between the two modalities
and limited paired datasets. This approach significantly extends the
applicability of 3DGS, enhancing visualization, simulation, and non-destructive
testing capabilities across various domains.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MUSE是一个无需训练、基于模型的零样本2D目标检测和分割框架，通过多视图模板、联合相似度度量和不确定性感知先验，在BOP Challenge 2025中取得最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决零样本2D目标检测和分割中模型泛化能力不足的问题，无需额外训练或微调即可处理未见过的3D对象。

Method: 使用3D未见对象的2D多视图模板和查询图像的2D目标提议，结合类别和补丁嵌入（GeM归一化），采用联合相似度度量（绝对和相对相似度）和不确定性感知对象先验来优化匹配。

Result: 在BOP Challenge 2025中排名第一，在Classic Core、H3和Industrial三个赛道均取得最先进性能。

Conclusion: MUSE提供了一个强大且可泛化的零样本2D目标检测和分割框架，无需训练即可实现优异性能。

Abstract: In this work, we introduce MUSE (Model-based Uncertainty-aware Similarity
Estimation), a training-free framework designed for model-based zero-shot 2D
object detection and segmentation. MUSE leverages 2D multi-view templates
rendered from 3D unseen objects and 2D object proposals extracted from input
query images. In the embedding stage, it integrates class and patch embeddings,
where the patch embeddings are normalized using generalized mean pooling (GeM)
to capture both global and local representations efficiently. During the
matching stage, MUSE employs a joint similarity metric that combines absolute
and relative similarity scores, enhancing the robustness of matching under
challenging scenarios. Finally, the similarity score is refined through an
uncertainty-aware object prior that adjusts for proposal reliability. Without
any additional training or fine-tuning, MUSE achieves state-of-the-art
performance on the BOP Challenge 2025, ranking first across the Classic Core,
H3, and Industrial tracks. These results demonstrate that MUSE offers a
powerful and generalizable framework for zero-shot 2D object detection and
segmentation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 光学音乐识别领域缺乏真实标注数据，特别是手写历史乐谱数据稀缺，需要合成数据来训练更好的识别模型

Method: 实现音乐符号级生成对抗网络(GAN)生成手写风格符号，使用Smashcima排版软件将生成的符号组装成完整乐谱

Abstract: The field of Optical Music Recognition (OMR) is currently hindered by the
scarcity of real annotated data, particularly when dealing with handwritten
historical musical scores. In similar fields, such as Handwritten Text
Recognition, it was proven that synthetic examples produced with image
generation techniques could help to train better-performing recognition
architectures. This study explores the generation of realistic,
handwritten-looking scores by implementing a music symbol-level Generative
Adversarial Network (GAN) and assembling its output into a full score using the
Smashcima engraving software. We have systematically evaluated the visual
fidelity of these generated samples, concluding that the generated symbols
exhibit a high degree of realism, marking significant progress in synthetic
score generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文分析了五个广泛使用的性别分类数据集，发现都存在严重的交叉性代表性不足问题。通过构建新的平衡数据集BalancedFace，显著减少了性别分类模型中的偏见，同时保持整体准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 性别分类系统经常继承并放大训练数据中的人口统计不平衡问题，导致模型存在偏见，特别是在女性和少数族裔群体上的错误分类率更高。

Method: 首先审计五个常用数据集，然后在两个相对平衡的数据集上训练分类器。为了解决数据引发的偏见，构建了BalancedFace数据集，通过混合FairFace和UTKFace的图像，并补充其他来源的图像来填补人口统计空白，确保189个年龄、种族和性别交叉子组的比例均衡。

Result: 使用BalancedFace训练的模型，相比最佳现有数据集，将种族子组间的最大真阳性率差距减少了50%以上，将平均差异影响分数改善了63%接近理想值1.0，同时整体准确性损失最小。

Conclusion: 数据中心的干预措施具有重要价值，BalancedFace为公平性别分类研究提供了公开可用的资源，证明了通过精心设计的数据集可以有效减少模型偏见。

Abstract: Gender classification systems often inherit and amplify demographic
imbalances in their training data. We first audit five widely used gender
classification datasets, revealing that all suffer from significant
intersectional underrepresentation. To measure the downstream impact of these
flaws, we train identical MobileNetV2 classifiers on the two most balanced of
these datasets, UTKFace and FairFace. Our fairness evaluation shows that even
these models exhibit significant bias, misclassifying female faces at a higher
rate than male faces and amplifying existing racial skew. To counter these
data-induced biases, we construct BalancedFace, a new public dataset created by
blending images from FairFace and UTKFace, supplemented with images from other
collections to fill missing demographic gaps. It is engineered to equalize
subgroup shares across 189 intersections of age, race, and gender using only
real, unedited images. When a standard classifier is trained on BalancedFace,
it reduces the maximum True Positive Rate gap across racial subgroups by over
50% and brings the average Disparate Impact score 63% closer to the ideal of
1.0 compared to the next-best dataset, all with a minimal loss of overall
accuracy. These results underline the profound value of data-centric
interventions and provide an openly available resource for fair gender
classification research.

Abstract: 3D weakly supervised semantic segmentation (3D WSSS) aims to achieve semantic
segmentation by leveraging sparse or low-cost annotated data, significantly
reducing reliance on dense point-wise annotations. Previous works mainly employ
class activation maps or pre-trained vision-language models to address this
challenge. However, the low quality of pseudo-labels and the insufficient
exploitation of 3D geometric priors jointly create significant technical
bottlenecks in developing high-performance 3D WSSS models. In this paper, we
propose a simple yet effective 3D weakly supervised semantic segmentation
method that integrates 3D geometric priors into a class-aware guidance
mechanism to generate high-fidelity pseudo labels. Concretely, our designed
methodology first employs Class-Aware Label Refinement module to generate more
balanced and accurate pseudo labels for semantic categrories. This initial
refinement stage focuses on enhancing label quality through category-specific
optimization. Subsequently, the Geometry-Aware Label Refinement component is
developed, which strategically integrates implicit 3D geometric constraints to
effectively filter out low-confidence pseudo labels that fail to comply with
geometric plausibility. Moreover, to address the challenge of extensive
unlabeled regions, we propose a Label Update strategy that integrates
Self-Training to propagate labels into these areas. This iterative process
continuously enhances pseudo-label quality while expanding label coverage,
ultimately fostering the development of high-performance 3D WSSS models.
Comprehensive experimental validation reveals that our proposed methodology
achieves state-of-the-art performance on both ScanNet and S3DIS benchmarks
while demonstrating remarkable generalization capability in unsupervised
settings, maintaining competitive accuracy through its robust design.

TL;DR: 评估三种分割模型和传统方法在MRI图像中分割伏隔核时的公平性问题，发现种族匹配训练能提高某些模型的准确性，而nnU-Net表现稳健。性别效应在手动和偏倚模型中均可观察到，但种族效应在大多数模型中消失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习分割算法在医学图像分析中取得进展，但数据内在偏倚导致基于种族和性别等敏感属性的性能差异，公平性问题日益紧迫。

Method: 使用UNesT、nnU-Net、CoTr三种分割模型和ANTs传统方法，在包含四个人口亚组的数据集上分割伏隔核，采用手动标注金标准，通过公平性指标和线性混合模型评估性能。

Result: 在种族匹配训练下，ANTs和UNesT的分割准确性显著提高，而nnU-Net表现稳健不受人口统计匹配影响。手动分割观察到的性别效应在偏倚模型中也可观察到，但种族效应在除一个模型外的所有模型中消失。

Conclusion: 人口统计匹配对分割性能有显著影响，某些模型对训练数据的人口统计特征敏感，而nnU-Net表现出更好的公平性。偏倚模型可能放大或掩盖人口统计效应，需在医学图像分析中重视公平性问题。

Abstract: Deep-learning-based segmentation algorithms have substantially advanced the
field of medical image analysis, particularly in structural delineations in
MRIs. However, an important consideration is the intrinsic bias in the data.
Concerns about unfairness, such as performance disparities based on sensitive
attributes like race and sex, are increasingly urgent. In this work, we
evaluate the results of three different segmentation models (UNesT, nnU-Net,
and CoTr) and a traditional atlas-based method (ANTs), applied to segment the
left and right nucleus accumbens (NAc) in MRI images. We utilize a dataset
including four demographic subgroups: black female, black male, white female,
and white male. We employ manually labeled gold-standard segmentations to train
and test segmentation models. This study consists of two parts: the first
assesses the segmentation performance of models, while the second measures the
volumes they produce to evaluate the effects of race, sex, and their
interaction. Fairness is quantitatively measured using a metric designed to
quantify fairness in segmentation performance. Additionally, linear mixed
models analyze the impact of demographic variables on segmentation accuracy and
derived volumes. Training on the same race as the test subjects leads to
significantly better segmentation accuracy for some models. ANTs and UNesT show
notable improvements in segmentation accuracy when trained and tested on
race-matched data, unlike nnU-Net, which demonstrates robust performance
independent of demographic matching. Finally, we examine sex and race effects
on the volume of the NAc using segmentations from the manual rater and from our
biased models. Results reveal that the sex effects observed with manual
segmentation can also be observed with biased models, whereas the race effects
disappear in all but one model.

Abstract: We present ManzaiSet, the first large scale multimodal dataset of viewer
responses to Japanese manzai comedy, capturing facial videos and audio from 241
participants watching up to 10 professional performances in randomized order
(94.6 percent watched >= 8; analyses focus on n=228). This addresses the
Western centric bias in affective computing. Three key findings emerge: (1) k
means clustering identified three distinct viewer types: High and Stable
Appreciators (72.8 percent, n=166), Low and Variable Decliners (13.2 percent,
n=30), and Variable Improvers (14.0 percent, n=32), with heterogeneity of
variance (Brown Forsythe p < 0.001); (2) individual level analysis revealed a
positive viewing order effect (mean slope = 0.488, t(227) = 5.42, p < 0.001,
permutation p < 0.001), contradicting fatigue hypotheses; (3) automated humor
classification (77 instances, 131 labels) plus viewer level response modeling
found no type wise differences after FDR correction. The dataset enables
culturally aware emotion AI development and personalized entertainment systems
tailored to non Western contexts.

Abstract: Engagement detection in online learning environments is vital for improving
student outcomes and personalizing instruction. We present ViBED-Net
(Video-Based Engagement Detection Network), a novel deep learning framework
designed to assess student engagement from video data using a dual-stream
architecture. ViBED-Net captures both facial expressions and full-scene context
by processing facial crops and entire video frames through EfficientNetV2 for
spatial feature extraction. These features are then analyzed over time using
two temporal modeling strategies: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and
Transformer encoders. Our model is evaluated on the DAiSEE dataset, a
large-scale benchmark for affective state recognition in e-learning. To enhance
performance on underrepresented engagement classes, we apply targeted data
augmentation techniques. Among the tested variants, ViBED-Net with LSTM
achieves 73.43\% accuracy, outperforming existing state-of-the-art approaches.
ViBED-Net demonstrates that combining face-aware and scene-aware spatiotemporal
cues significantly improves engagement detection accuracy. Its modular design
allows flexibility for application across education, user experience research,
and content personalization. This work advances video-based affective computing
by offering a scalable, high-performing solution for real-world engagement
analysis. The source code for this project is available on

TL;DR: SAVANT是一个结构化推理框架，通过分层场景分析和两阶段流程，显著提升了自动驾驶系统中语义异常检测的准确性和召回率，并使开源小模型性能超越大型专有模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自动驾驶系统对罕见、分布外语义异常场景的脆弱性，以及现有视觉语言模型方法性能不可靠、依赖昂贵专有模型的问题。

Method: 采用结构化推理框架，包含分层场景描述提取和多模态评估两阶段流程，在街道、基础设施、可移动对象和环境四个语义层进行系统分析。

Result: 在真实驾驶场景中达到89.6%召回率和88.0%准确率，微调后的7B参数开源模型Qwen2.5VL达到90.8%召回率和93.8%准确率，超越所有评估模型。

Conclusion: SAVANT解决了异常检测中的数据稀缺问题，为自动驾驶系统提供了可靠、可访问的语义监控实用路径，支持本地部署且成本极低。

Abstract: Autonomous driving systems remain critically vulnerable to the long-tail of
rare, out-of-distribution scenarios with semantic anomalies. While Vision
Language Models (VLMs) offer promising reasoning capabilities, naive prompting
approaches yield unreliable performance and depend on expensive proprietary
models, limiting practical deployment. We introduce SAVANT (Semantic Analysis
with Vision-Augmented Anomaly deTection), a structured reasoning framework that
achieves high accuracy and recall in detecting anomalous driving scenarios from
input images through layered scene analysis and a two-phase pipeline:
structured scene description extraction followed by multi-modal evaluation. Our
approach transforms VLM reasoning from ad-hoc prompting to systematic analysis
across four semantic layers: Street, Infrastructure, Movable Objects, and
Environment. SAVANT achieves 89.6% recall and 88.0% accuracy on real-world
driving scenarios, significantly outperforming unstructured baselines. More
importantly, we demonstrate that our structured framework enables a fine-tuned
7B parameter open-source model (Qwen2.5VL) to achieve 90.8% recall and 93.8%
accuracy - surpassing all models evaluated while enabling local deployment at
near-zero cost. By automatically labeling over 9,640 real-world images with
high accuracy, SAVANT addresses the critical data scarcity problem in anomaly
detection and provides a practical path toward reliable, accessible semantic
monitoring for autonomous systems.

Abstract: The red palm mite infestation has become a serious concern, particularly in
regions with extensive palm cultivation, leading to reduced productivity and
economic losses. Accurate and early identification of mite-infested plants is
critical for effective management. The current study focuses on evaluating and
comparing the ML model for classifying the affected plants and detecting the
infestation. TriggerNet is a novel interpretable AI framework that integrates
Grad-CAM, RISE, FullGrad, and TCAV to generate novel visual explanations for
deep learning models in plant classification and disease detection. This study
applies TriggerNet to address red palm mite (Raoiella indica) infestation, a
major threat to palm cultivation and agricultural productivity. A diverse set
of RGB images across 11 plant species, Arecanut, Date Palm, Bird of Paradise,
Coconut Palm, Ginger, Citrus Tree, Palm Oil, Orchid, Banana Palm, Avocado Tree,
and Cast Iron Plant was utilized for training and evaluation. Advanced deep
learning models like CNN, EfficientNet, MobileNet, ViT, ResNet50, and
InceptionV3, alongside machine learning classifiers such as Random Forest, SVM,
and KNN, were employed for plant classification. For disease classification,
all plants were categorized into four classes: Healthy, Yellow Spots, Reddish
Bronzing, and Silk Webbing. Snorkel was used to efficiently label these disease
classes by leveraging heuristic rules and patterns, reducing manual annotation
time and improving dataset reliability.

Abstract: We introduce HouseTour, a method for spatially-aware 3D camera trajectory and
natural language summary generation from a collection of images depicting an
existing 3D space. Unlike existing vision-language models (VLMs), which
struggle with geometric reasoning, our approach generates smooth video
trajectories via a diffusion process constrained by known camera poses and
integrates this information into the VLM for 3D-grounded descriptions. We
synthesize the final video using 3D Gaussian splatting to render novel views
along the trajectory. To support this task, we present the HouseTour dataset,
which includes over 1,200 house-tour videos with camera poses, 3D
reconstructions, and real estate descriptions. Experiments demonstrate that
incorporating 3D camera trajectories into the text generation process improves
performance over methods handling each task independently. We evaluate both
individual and end-to-end performance, introducing a new joint metric. Our work
enables automated, professional-quality video creation for real estate and
touristic applications without requiring specialized expertise or equipment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有个性化图像生成模型缺乏对从多个源图像特定部分组合对象的显式控制能力。

Method: 构建基于464个独特(部分，主体)对的语义原子数据集，生成37k提示并使用高保真文本到图像模型合成图像。训练具有部分条件引导的自定义扩散先验模型，通过部分条件引导控制图像条件特征以强制语义一致性和空间布局。

Result: 提出PartEval客观指标评估生成管道的保真度和组合准确性。人类评估和提出的指标显示Chimera在部分对齐和组合准确性上优于其他基线14%，在视觉质量上优于21%。

Conclusion: Chimera模型能够有效实现从多个源图像组合特定部分的个性化图像生成，在组合准确性和视觉质量方面显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Personalized image generative models are highly proficient at synthesizing
images from text or a single image, yet they lack explicit control for
composing objects from specific parts of multiple source images without user
specified masks or annotations. To address this, we introduce Chimera, a
personalized image generation model that generates novel objects by combining
specified parts from different source images according to textual instructions.
To train our model, we first construct a dataset from a taxonomy built on 464
unique (part, subject) pairs, which we term semantic atoms. From this, we
generate 37k prompts and synthesize the corresponding images with a
high-fidelity text-to-image model. We train a custom diffusion prior model with
part-conditional guidance, which steers the image-conditioning features to
enforce both semantic identity and spatial layout. We also introduce an
objective metric PartEval to assess the fidelity and compositional accuracy of
generation pipelines. Human evaluations and our proposed metric show that
Chimera outperforms other baselines by 14% in part alignment and compositional
accuracy and 21% in visual quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微塑料是普遍存在的污染物，传统检测方法需要人工分析且难以在大规模筛选中高效应用，机器学习为此提供了新的解决方案。

Method: 使用SEM成像结合YOLO目标检测模型，专注于具有对称重复图案背景的过滤场景，并优化预处理流程。

Result: 研究发现不同YOLO模型在该任务中表现存在差异，预处理优化对检测质量有重要影响，同时发现专家标注数据不足是主要挑战。

Conclusion: 机器学习在微塑料检测中具有潜力，但需要解决数据标注不足等问题，未来需要进一步优化模型和预处理方法。

Abstract: Microplastics (MPs) are ubiquitous pollutants with demonstrated potential to
impact ecosystems and human health. Their microscopic size complicates
detection, classification, and removal, especially in biological and
environmental samples. While techniques like optical microscopy, Scanning
Electron Microscopy (SEM), and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) provide a sound
basis for detection, applying these approaches requires usually manual analysis
and prevents efficient use in large screening studies. To this end, machine
learning (ML) has emerged as a powerful tool in advancing microplastic
detection. In this exploratory study, we investigate potential, limitations and
future directions of advancing the detection and quantification of MP particles
and fibres using a combination of SEM imaging and machine learning-based object
detection. For simplicity, we focus on a filtration scenario where image
backgrounds exhibit a symmetric and repetitive pattern. Our findings indicate
differences in the quality of YOLO models for the given task and the relevance
of optimizing preprocessing. At the same time, we identify open challenges,
such as limited amounts of expert-labeled data necessary for reliable training
of ML models.

TL;DR: APT通过在同一图像中使用多种不同大小的patch来减少ViT的输入序列长度，在图像均匀区域使用大patch，复杂区域使用小patch，显著提升ViT的训练和推理速度，同时保持下游任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统ViT将输入图像划分为统一大小的patch，不考虑图像内容，导致高分辨率图像输入序列过长，计算效率低下。

Method: 提出自适应patch变换器(APT)，在同一图像中根据内容复杂度自适应分配不同大小的patch，均匀区域用大patch减少token数量，复杂区域用小patch保留细节。

Result: 在ViT-L和ViT-H上分别实现40%和50%的吞吐量提升，保持下游任务性能；在视觉问答、目标检测和语义分割等密集视觉任务中实现高达30%的训练和推理加速。

Conclusion: APT方法能显著提升ViT的计算效率，可在已微调的ViT上快速应用，仅需1个epoch即可收敛，为高分辨率视觉任务提供了高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) partition input images into uniformly sized
patches regardless of their content, resulting in long input sequence lengths
for high-resolution images. We present Adaptive Patch Transformers (APT), which
addresses this by using multiple different patch sizes within the same image.
APT reduces the total number of input tokens by allocating larger patch sizes
in more homogeneous areas and smaller patches in more complex ones. APT
achieves a drastic speedup in ViT inference and training, increasing throughput
by 40% on ViT-L and 50% on ViT-H while maintaining downstream performance, and
can be applied to a previously fine-tuned ViT, converging in as little as 1
epoch. It also significantly reduces training and inference time without loss
of performance in high-resolution dense visual tasks, achieving up to 30\%
faster training and inference in visual QA, object detection, and semantic
segmentation.

Conclusion: 3DGS凭借其高效渲染能力和前馈管道的适用性，在3D重建领域展现出巨大潜力，但需要继续解决其内存和光照建模方面的局限性。

Abstract: The problem of 3D reconstruction from posed images is undergoing a
fundamental transformation, driven by continuous advances in 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS). By modeling scenes explicitly as collections of 3D Gaussians,
3DGS enables efficient rasterization through volumetric splatting, offering
thus a seamless integration with common graphics pipelines. Despite its
real-time rendering capabilities for novel view synthesis, 3DGS suffers from a
high memory footprint, the tendency to bake lighting effects directly into its
representation, and limited support for secondary-ray effects. This tutorial
provides a concise yet comprehensive overview of the 3DGS pipeline, starting
from its splatting formulation and then exploring the main efforts in
addressing its limitations. Finally, we survey a range of applications that
leverage 3DGS for surface reconstruction, avatar modeling, animation, and
content generation-highlighting its efficient rendering and suitability for
feed-forward pipelines.

Conclusion: 该方法为低资源环境下的视觉语言模型部署提供了有效的解决方案，通过上下文蒸馏在有限计算预算下实现性能提升。

Abstract: As the field continues its push for ever more resources, this work turns the
spotlight on a critical question: how can vision-language models (VLMs) be
adapted to thrive in low-resource, budget-constrained settings? While large
VLMs offer strong performance, they are impractical to deploy in such settings.
Small VLMs, on the other hand, are efficient but typically require costly
fine-tuning to close the performance gap with larger models in the deployment
domain. Inspired by the in-context learning framework, we propose an online
In-Context Distillation (ICD) method, in which a small VLM collaborates with a
stronger teacher model at inference time, distilling its knowledge via sparse
demonstrations to efficiently bridge the gap between them. Our method is built
on an in-depth analysis that identifies the scale and the choice of models for
which vision-language ICL is currently feasible, and demonstrates the advantage
of ICL over fine-tuning under constrained compute budgets. We enhance our
method with a novel cross-modal demonstration selection strategy, teacher
test-time scaling to reduce noise, and student uncertainty conditioning to
dynamically populate a demonstration pool and minimize teacher queries. Our ICD
method significantly boosts the performance of small models (up to 33%) using
scarce teacher annotations (as low as 4%), and competes with the teacher's
zero-shot performance.

Abstract: Collaborative driving systems leverage vehicle-to-everything (V2X)
communication across multiple agents to enhance driving safety and efficiency.
Traditional V2X systems take raw sensor data, neural features, or perception
results as communication media, which face persistent challenges, including
high bandwidth demands, semantic loss, and interoperability issues. Recent
advances investigate natural language as a promising medium, which can provide
semantic richness, decision-level reasoning, and human-machine interoperability
at significantly lower bandwidth. Despite great promise, this paradigm shift
also introduces new vulnerabilities within language communication, including
message loss, hallucinations, semantic manipulation, and adversarial attacks.
In this work, we present the first systematic study of full-stack safety and
security issues in natural-language-based collaborative driving. Specifically,
we develop a comprehensive taxonomy of attack strategies, including connection
disruption, relay/replay interference, content spoofing, and multi-connection
forgery. To mitigate these risks, we introduce an agentic defense pipeline,
which we call SafeCoop, that integrates a semantic firewall,
language-perception consistency checks, and multi-source consensus, enabled by
an agentic transformation function for cross-frame spatial alignment. We
systematically evaluate SafeCoop in closed-loop CARLA simulation across 32
critical scenarios, achieving 69.15% driving score improvement under malicious
attacks and up to 67.32% F1 score for malicious detection. This study provides
guidance for advancing research on safe, secure, and trustworthy
language-driven collaboration in transportation systems. Our project page is

TL;DR: World-in-World平台首次在闭环环境中评估生成世界模型，发现视觉质量不等于任务成功率，可控性更重要；数据后训练比升级预训练视频生成器更有效；增加推理计算可显著提升闭环性能。


<details>

Motivation: 现有基准测试采用开环协议，强调视觉质量而忽略了世界模型在具身任务中的实际效用，需要开发能评估世界模型在真实代理-环境交互中表现的新平台。

Method: 开发World-in-World开放平台，提供统一的在线规划策略和标准化动作API，构建四个闭环环境来严格评估不同世界模型，以任务成功率作为主要指标。

Result: 发现了三个意外结果：视觉质量不能保证任务成功，可控性更重要；数据后训练比升级预训练视频生成器更有效；增加推理计算可显著提升闭环性能。

Conclusion: 世界模型在具身智能中的评估需要闭环环境，视觉质量不是决定性因素，可控性和推理计算分配对任务成功更为关键。

Abstract: Generative world models (WMs) can now simulate worlds with striking visual
realism, which naturally raises the question of whether they can endow embodied
agents with predictive perception for decision making. Progress on this
question has been limited by fragmented evaluation: most existing benchmarks
adopt open-loop protocols that emphasize visual quality in isolation, leaving
the core issue of embodied utility unresolved, i.e., do WMs actually help
agents succeed at embodied tasks? To address this gap, we introduce
World-in-World, the first open platform that benchmarks WMs in a closed-loop
world that mirrors real agent-environment interactions. World-in-World provides
a unified online planning strategy and a standardized action API, enabling
heterogeneous WMs for decision making. We curate four closed-loop environments
that rigorously evaluate diverse WMs, prioritize task success as the primary
metric, and move beyond the common focus on visual quality; we also present the
first data scaling law for world models in embodied settings. Our study
uncovers three surprises: (1) visual quality alone does not guarantee task
success, controllability matters more; (2) scaling post-training with
action-observation data is more effective than upgrading the pretrained video
generators; and (3) allocating more inference-time compute allows WMs to
substantially improve closed-loop performance.

Abstract: Accurate 3D reconstruction of lunar surfaces is essential for space
exploration. However, existing stereo vision reconstruction methods struggle in
this context due to the Moon's lack of texture, difficult lighting variations,
and atypical orbital trajectories. State-of-the-art deep learning models,
trained on human-scale datasets, have rarely been tested on planetary imagery
and cannot be transferred directly to lunar conditions. To address this issue,
we introduce LunarStereo, the first open dataset of photorealistic stereo image
pairs of the Moon, simulated using ray tracing based on high-resolution
topography and reflectance models. It covers diverse altitudes, lighting
conditions, and viewing angles around the lunar South Pole, offering physically
grounded supervision for 3D reconstruction tasks. Based on this dataset, we
adapt the MASt3R model to the lunar domain through fine-tuning on LunarStereo.
We validate our approach through extensive qualitative and quantitative
experiments on both synthetic and real lunar data, evaluating 3D surface
reconstruction and relative pose estimation. Extensive experiments on synthetic
and real lunar data validate the approach, demonstrating significant
improvements over zero-shot baselines and paving the way for robust cross-scale
generalization in extraterrestrial environments.

Conclusion: VelocityNet框架成功解决了拥挤场景中的异常检测问题，通过个体速度分析和语义运动分类实现了有效的实时异常检测。

Abstract: Detecting anomalies in crowded scenes is challenging due to severe
inter-person occlusions and highly dynamic, context-dependent motion patterns.
Existing approaches often struggle to adapt to varying crowd densities and lack
interpretable anomaly indicators. To address these limitations, we introduce
VelocityNet, a dual-pipeline framework that combines head detection and dense
optical flow to extract person-specific velocities. Hierarchical clustering
categorizes these velocities into semantic motion classes (halt, slow, normal,
and fast), and a percentile-based anomaly scoring system measures deviations
from learned normal patterns. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our
framework in real-time detection of diverse anomalous motion patterns within
densely crowded environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种基于可解释深度学习的新型一次性剪枝框架，通过因果感知方法在剪枝过程中利用模型预测与结构间的因果关系，实现在不进行微调的情况下显著减小模型尺寸且性能损失最小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 结构化剪枝虽然能加速推理和减少内存开销，但通常需要迭代重训练，计算成本高。现有的一次性剪枝方法在训练后直接应用剪枝，但往往导致性能显著下降。

Method: 采用因果感知剪枝方法，在渐进式剪枝过程中利用模型预测与结构间的因果关系，确保被移除的结构不会损害模型性能。

Result: 在卷积神经网络和视觉变换器基准模型上的实验表明，该方法能显著减小模型尺寸，对性能影响最小，且无需微调。

Conclusion: 该方法优于现有方法，提供了最佳的性能与模型尺寸权衡。

Abstract: Neural network compression has gained increasing attention in recent years,
particularly in computer vision applications, where the need for model
reduction is crucial for overcoming deployment constraints. Pruning is a widely
used technique that prompts sparsity in model structures, e.g. weights,
neurons, and layers, reducing size and inference costs. Structured pruning is
especially important as it allows for the removal of entire structures, which
further accelerates inference time and reduces memory overhead. However, it can
be computationally expensive, requiring iterative retraining and optimization.
To overcome this problem, recent methods considered one-shot setting, which
applies pruning directly at post-training. Unfortunately, they often lead to a
considerable drop in performance. In this paper, we focus on this issue by
proposing a novel one-shot pruning framework that relies on explainable deep
learning. First, we introduce a causal-aware pruning approach that leverages
cause-effect relations between model predictions and structures in a
progressive pruning process. It allows us to efficiently reduce the size of the
network, ensuring that the removed structures do not deter the performance of
the model. Then, through experiments conducted on convolution neural network
and vision transformer baselines, pre-trained on classification tasks, we
demonstrate that our method consistently achieves substantial reductions in
model size, with minimal impact on performance, and without the need for
fine-tuning. Overall, our approach outperforms its counterparts, offering the
best trade-off. Our code is available on GitHub.

TL;DR: 提出了RadDiagSeg-D数据集和RadDiagSeg-M模型，解决医疗视觉语言模型无法同时生成诊断文本和像素级分割掩码的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前医疗视觉语言模型难以同时生成诊断文本和像素级分割掩码，这限制了临床应用的实用性。

Method: 首先创建RadDiagSeg-D数据集，将异常检测、诊断和多目标分割整合为统一层次任务；然后基于该数据集开发RadDiagSeg-M模型。

Result: RadDiagSeg-M在多项任务中表现优异，能够同时生成描述性文本和对应的分割掩码。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了辅助诊断中需要丰富上下文信息的需求，为多目标文本和掩码生成任务建立了强有力的基准。

Abstract: Most current medical vision language models struggle to jointly generate
diagnostic text and pixel-level segmentation masks in response to complex
visual questions. This represents a major limitation towards clinical
application, as assistive systems that fail to provide both modalities
simultaneously offer limited value to medical practitioners. To alleviate this
limitation, we first introduce RadDiagSeg-D, a dataset combining abnormality
detection, diagnosis, and multi-target segmentation into a unified and
hierarchical task. RadDiagSeg-D covers multiple imaging modalities and is
precisely designed to support the development of models that produce
descriptive text and corresponding segmentation masks in tandem. Subsequently,
we leverage the dataset to propose a novel vision-language model, RadDiagSeg-M,
capable of joint abnormality detection, diagnosis, and flexible segmentation.
RadDiagSeg-M provides highly informative and clinically useful outputs,
effectively addressing the need to enrich contextual information for assistive
diagnosis. Finally, we benchmark RadDiagSeg-M and showcase its strong
performance across all components involved in the task of multi-target
text-and-mask generation, establishing a robust and competitive baseline.

*Maryam Dialameh,Hossein Rajabzadeh,Jung Suk Sim,Hyock Ju Kwon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EMA-SAM是一个轻量级扩展的SAM-2模型，通过引入置信度加权的指数移动平均指针来提供跨帧的稳定肿瘤潜在原型，显著提高了甲状腺微小乳头状癌超声视频分割的稳定性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决甲状腺微小乳头状癌射频消融中超声视频分割的挑战，包括低对比度、探头引起的运动和热相关伪影，以及SAM-2模型在介入超声中帧独立设计导致的不稳定预测和时间漂移问题。

Method: 在SAM-2基础上引入置信度加权的指数移动平均指针到记忆库中，提供跨帧的稳定肿瘤潜在原型，保持时间一致性同时快速适应清晰证据的重新出现。

Result: 在PTMC-RFA数据集上，EMA-SAM将maxDice从0.82提升到0.86，maxIoU从0.72提升到0.76，假阳性减少29%。在外部基准测试中，Dice得分比SAM-2提高2-5个百分点，同时仅增加<0.1%的计算量，保持约30FPS的实时吞吐量。

Conclusion: EMA-SAM作为一个稳健高效的框架，成功弥合了基础模型与介入超声严格需求之间的差距，实现了稳定的肿瘤跟踪。

Abstract: Papillary thyroid microcarcinoma (PTMC) is increasingly managed with
radio-frequency ablation (RFA), yet accurate lesion segmentation in ultrasound
videos remains difficult due to low contrast, probe-induced motion, and
heat-related artifacts. The recent Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM-2) generalizes
well to static images, but its frame-independent design yields unstable
predictions and temporal drift in interventional ultrasound. We introduce
\textbf{EMA-SAM}, a lightweight extension of SAM-2 that incorporates a
confidence-weighted exponential moving average pointer into the memory bank,
providing a stable latent prototype of the tumour across frames. This design
preserves temporal coherence through probe pressure and bubble occlusion while
rapidly adapting once clear evidence reappears. On our curated PTMC-RFA dataset
(124 minutes, 13 patients), EMA-SAM improves \emph{maxDice} from 0.82 (SAM-2)
to 0.86 and \emph{maxIoU} from 0.72 to 0.76, while reducing false positives by
29\%. On external benchmarks, including VTUS and colonoscopy video polyp
datasets, EMA-SAM achieves consistent gains of 2--5 Dice points over SAM-2.
Importantly, the EMA pointer adds \textless0.1\% FLOPs, preserving real-time
throughput of $\sim$30\,FPS on a single A100 GPU. These results establish
EMA-SAM as a robust and efficient framework for stable tumour tracking,
bridging the gap between foundation models and the stringent demands of
interventional ultrasound. Codes are available here \hyperref[code

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了VLSU框架，系统评估多模态模型安全性，发现模型在联合图像-文本理解方面存在系统性失败，特别是在组合推理能力方面表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有安全评估方法将视觉和语言输入分开处理，忽略了联合解释时良性内容组合可能产生有害影响的风险，且无法清晰区分明显不安全内容和边界情况。

Method: 使用多阶段流水线构建包含8,187个样本的大规模基准数据集，涵盖15种危害类别和17种安全模式，通过细粒度严重性分类和组合分析评估11个最先进模型。

Result: 模型在清晰单模态安全信号上准确率达90%以上，但在需要联合图像-文本推理时性能大幅下降至20-55%，34%的联合分类错误发生在单模态分类正确的情况下。

Conclusion: 当前模型在联合图像-文本理解和安全对齐方面存在明显弱点，VLSU框架为稳健视觉语言安全研究提供了关键测试平台。

Abstract: Safety evaluation of multimodal foundation models often treats vision and
language inputs separately, missing risks from joint interpretation where
benign content becomes harmful in combination. Existing approaches also fail to
distinguish clearly unsafe content from borderline cases, leading to
problematic over-blocking or under-refusal of genuinely harmful content. We
present Vision Language Safety Understanding (VLSU), a comprehensive framework
to systematically evaluate multimodal safety through fine-grained severity
classification and combinatorial analysis across 17 distinct safety patterns.
Using a multi-stage pipeline with real-world images and human annotation, we
construct a large-scale benchmark of 8,187 samples spanning 15 harm categories.
Our evaluation of eleven state-of-the-art models reveals systematic joint
understanding failures: while models achieve 90%-plus accuracy on clear
unimodal safety signals, performance degrades substantially to 20-55% when
joint image-text reasoning is required to determine the safety label. Most
critically, 34% of errors in joint image-text safety classification occur
despite correct classification of the individual modalities, further
demonstrating absent compositional reasoning capabilities. Additionally, we
find that models struggle to balance refusing unsafe content while still
responding to borderline cases that deserve engagement. For example, we find
that instruction framing can reduce the over-blocking rate on borderline
content from 62.4% to 10.4% in Gemini-1.5, but only at the cost of
under-refusing on unsafe content with refusal rate dropping from 90.8% to
53.9%. Overall, our framework exposes weaknesses in joint image-text
understanding and alignment gaps in current models, and provides a critical
test bed to enable the next milestones in research on robust vision-language
safety.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于生成的物体检测去偏框架，通过表示分数诊断表示差距，使用视觉蓝图和生成对齐策略生成高质量、无偏的图像布局，显著提升罕见物体检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有去偏方法受限于样本表示多样性，简单生成增强往往保留原有偏见。研究发现仅增加罕见类数据不够，因为实例频率不能完全反映模型需求，且当前布局到图像合成缺乏保真度和控制能力。

Method: 引入表示分数(RS)诊断表示差距，指导创建无偏布局；用精确视觉蓝图替代模糊文本提示，采用生成对齐策略促进检测器与生成器之间的通信。

Result: 显著缩小了代表性不足物体组的性能差距，大/罕见实例mAP分别提升4.4/3.6，在生成图像的布局准确性上比现有L2I合成模型高出15.9 mAP。

Conclusion: 该方法通过表示分数和生成对齐策略有效解决了物体检测中的偏见问题，为高质量、可控的场景生成提供了新思路。

Abstract: This paper presents a generation-based debiasing framework for object
detection. Prior debiasing methods are often limited by the representation
diversity of samples, while naive generative augmentation often preserves the
biases it aims to solve. Moreover, our analysis reveals that simply generating
more data for rare classes is suboptimal due to two core issues: i) instance
frequency is an incomplete proxy for the true data needs of a model, and ii)
current layout-to-image synthesis lacks the fidelity and control to generate
high-quality, complex scenes. To overcome this, we introduce the representation
score (RS) to diagnose representational gaps beyond mere frequency, guiding the
creation of new, unbiased layouts. To ensure high-quality synthesis, we replace
ambiguous text prompts with a precise visual blueprint and employ a generative
alignment strategy, which fosters communication between the detector and
generator. Our method significantly narrows the performance gap for
underrepresented object groups, \eg, improving large/rare instances by 4.4/3.6
mAP over the baseline, and surpassing prior L2I synthesis models by 15.9 mAP
for layout accuracy in generated images.

Motivation: 研究通过光学2D映射压缩长上下文的可行性，解决历史长上下文压缩和LLM记忆遗忘机制等问题。

Method: 采用DeepEncoder保持低激活高分辨率输入，实现高压缩比，确保视觉令牌数量可控；使用DeepSeek3B-MoE-A570M作为解码器。

Result: 压缩比<10x时OCR精度97%，压缩比20x时精度60%；在OmniDocBench上超越GOT-OCR2.0和MinerU2.0，单A100-40G每日可处理20万+页面。

Conclusion: DeepSeek-OCR在长上下文压缩方面表现出巨大潜力，具有高实用价值，代码和模型权重已公开。

Abstract: We present DeepSeek-OCR as an initial investigation into the feasibility of
compressing long contexts via optical 2D mapping. DeepSeek-OCR consists of two
components: DeepEncoder and DeepSeek3B-MoE-A570M as the decoder. Specifically,
DeepEncoder serves as the core engine, designed to maintain low activations
under high-resolution input while achieving high compression ratios to ensure
an optimal and manageable number of vision tokens. Experiments show that when
the number of text tokens is within 10 times that of vision tokens (i.e., a
compression ratio < 10x), the model can achieve decoding (OCR) precision of
97%. Even at a compression ratio of 20x, the OCR accuracy still remains at
about 60%. This shows considerable promise for research areas such as
historical long-context compression and memory forgetting mechanisms in LLMs.
Beyond this, DeepSeek-OCR also demonstrates high practical value. On
OmniDocBench, it surpasses GOT-OCR2.0 (256 tokens/page) using only 100 vision
tokens, and outperforms MinerU2.0 (6000+ tokens per page on average) while
utilizing fewer than 800 vision tokens. In production, DeepSeek-OCR can
generate training data for LLMs/VLMs at a scale of 200k+ pages per day (a
single A100-40G). Codes and model weights are publicly accessible at
http://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-OCR.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BlendCLIP是一个多模态预训练框架，通过结合合成数据和真实数据的优势来弥合3D物体分类中的合成到真实域差距，使用课程学习策略逐步适应真实世界扫描特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决3D物体分类中合成训练数据与真实稀疏、噪声LiDAR扫描之间的域差距问题，同时避免仅依赖真实数据导致的语义多样性不足。

Method: 提出生成大规模物体级三元组数据集（点云、图像、文本描述），并采用课程学习的数据混合策略，先在语义丰富的合成CAD数据上训练，再逐步适应真实世界扫描。

Result: 仅需1.5%真实世界样本即可在nuScenes基准上提升零样本准确率27%，在nuScenes和TruckScenes数据集上达到最先进性能，比之前最佳方法提升19.3%。

Conclusion: 有效的域适应而非大规模真实世界标注是实现稳健开放词汇3D感知的关键。

Abstract: Zero-shot 3D object classification is crucial for real-world applications
like autonomous driving, however it is often hindered by a significant domain
gap between the synthetic data used for training and the sparse, noisy LiDAR
scans encountered in the real-world. Current methods trained solely on
synthetic data fail to generalize to outdoor scenes, while those trained only
on real data lack the semantic diversity to recognize rare or unseen objects.
  We introduce BlendCLIP, a multimodal pretraining framework that bridges this
synthetic-to-real gap by strategically combining the strengths of both domains.
We first propose a pipeline to generate a large-scale dataset of object-level
triplets -- consisting of a point cloud, image, and text description -- mined
directly from real-world driving data and human annotated 3D boxes. Our core
contribution is a curriculum-based data mixing strategy that first grounds the
model in the semantically rich synthetic CAD data before progressively adapting
it to the specific characteristics of real-world scans.
  Our experiments show that our approach is highly label-efficient: introducing
as few as 1.5\% real-world samples per batch into training boosts zero-shot
accuracy on the nuScenes benchmark by 27\%. Consequently, our final model
achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging outdoor datasets like
nuScenes and TruckScenes, improving over the best prior method by 19.3\% on
nuScenes, while maintaining strong generalization on diverse synthetic
benchmarks. Our findings demonstrate that effective domain adaptation, not
full-scale real-world annotation, is the key to unlocking robust
open-vocabulary 3D perception. Our code and dataset will be released upon
acceptance on https://github.com/kesu1/BlendCLIP.

Motivation: 现有的语义高斯溅射方法存在两个主要限制：(1) 预处理过程中单个掩码的上下文线索不足；(2) 从2D模型融合多视角特征时存在不一致性和细节缺失问题。

Method: 提出OpenInsGaussian框架，包含两个模块：上下文感知特征提取（为每个掩码增强丰富的语义上下文）和注意力驱动特征聚合（选择性融合多视角特征以减少对齐错误和不完整性）。

Abstract: Understanding 3D scenes is pivotal for autonomous driving, robotics, and
augmented reality. Recent semantic Gaussian Splatting approaches leverage
large-scale 2D vision models to project 2D semantic features onto 3D scenes.
However, they suffer from two major limitations: (1) insufficient contextual
cues for individual masks during preprocessing and (2) inconsistencies and
missing details when fusing multi-view features from these 2D models. In this
paper, we introduce \textbf{OpenInsGaussian}, an \textbf{Open}-vocabulary
\textbf{Ins}tance \textbf{Gaussian} segmentation framework with Context-aware
Cross-view Fusion. Our method consists of two modules: Context-Aware Feature
Extraction, which augments each mask with rich semantic context, and
Attention-Driven Feature Aggregation, which selectively fuses multi-view
features to mitigate alignment errors and incompleteness. Through extensive
experiments on benchmark datasets, OpenInsGaussian achieves state-of-the-art
results in open-vocabulary 3D Gaussian segmentation, outperforming existing
baselines by a large margin. These findings underscore the robustness and
generality of our proposed approach, marking a significant step forward in 3D

Motivation: 现有视频3D人体网格恢复方法在欧几里得空间中学习网格特征，难以准确捕捉人体的自然层次结构（如躯干-肢体-手指），导致重建错误。

Method: 设计时间运动先验提取模块分别从3D姿态序列和图像特征序列提取时间运动特征，结合成时间运动先验；提出双曲空间优化学习策略，在双曲空间中使用3D姿态和姿态运动信息优化学习网格特征；引入双曲网格优化损失确保学习过程稳定有效。

Result: 在大型公开数据集上的广泛实验结果表明，该方法相比现有最先进方法具有优越性能。

Conclusion: 通过利用时间运动先验和双曲空间学习，能够更准确地恢复3D人体网格，有效捕捉人体的层次结构特征。

Abstract: 3D human meshes show a natural hierarchical structure (like
torso-limbs-fingers). But existing video-based 3D human mesh recovery methods
usually learn mesh features in Euclidean space. It's hard to catch this
hierarchical structure accurately. So wrong human meshes are reconstructed. To
solve this problem, we propose a hyperbolic space learning method leveraging
temporal motion prior for recovering 3D human meshes from videos. First, we
design a temporal motion prior extraction module. This module extracts the
temporal motion features from the input 3D pose sequences and image feature
sequences respectively. Then it combines them into the temporal motion prior.
In this way, it can strengthen the ability to express features in the temporal
motion dimension. Since data representation in non-Euclidean space has been
proved to effectively capture hierarchical relationships in real-world datasets
(especially in hyperbolic space), we further design a hyperbolic space
optimization learning strategy. This strategy uses the temporal motion prior
information to assist learning, and uses 3D pose and pose motion information
respectively in the hyperbolic space to optimize and learn the mesh features.
Then, we combine the optimized results to get an accurate and smooth human
mesh. Besides, to make the optimization learning process of human meshes in
hyperbolic space stable and effective, we propose a hyperbolic mesh
optimization loss. Extensive experimental results on large publicly available
datasets indicate superiority in comparison with most state-of-the-art.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable success in
natural scene understanding, yet their application to underwater environments
remains largely unexplored. Underwater imagery presents unique challenges
including severe light attenuation, color distortion, and suspended particle
scattering, while requiring specialized knowledge of marine ecosystems and
organism taxonomy. To bridge this gap, we introduce UWBench, a comprehensive
benchmark specifically designed for underwater vision-language understanding.
UWBench comprises 15,003 high-resolution underwater images captured across
diverse aquatic environments, encompassing oceans, coral reefs, and deep-sea
habitats. Each image is enriched with human-verified annotations including
15,281 object referring expressions that precisely describe marine organisms
and underwater structures, and 124,983 question-answer pairs covering diverse
reasoning capabilities from object recognition to ecological relationship
understanding. The dataset captures rich variations in visibility, lighting
conditions, and water turbidity, providing a realistic testbed for model
evaluation. Based on UWBench, we establish three comprehensive benchmarks:
detailed image captioning for generating ecologically informed scene
descriptions, visual grounding for precise localization of marine organisms,
and visual question answering for multimodal reasoning about underwater
environments. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art VLMs demonstrate that
underwater understanding remains challenging, with substantial room for
improvement. Our benchmark provides essential resources for advancing
vision-language research in underwater contexts and supporting applications in
marine science, ecological monitoring, and autonomous underwater exploration.
Our code and benchmark will be available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D人体网格恢复方法未能充分利用潜在信息（如人体运动、形状对齐），导致肢体错位和局部细节不足；同时基于注意力机制的网格顶点和姿态节点交互方法计算成本过高。

Method: 两阶段网络：第一阶段从图像特征的低频和高频分量挖掘全局和局部信息，聚合为混合潜在频域特征；第二阶段利用这些特征建模粗略3D人体网格模板与3D姿态的交互学习，通过降维和并行优化设计低维网格姿态交互方法。

Conclusion: 提出的两阶段网络通过潜在信息挖掘和低维交互学习，有效解决了3D人体网格恢复中的肢体错位和计算成本问题，实现了优越的性能。

Abstract: Existing 3D human mesh recovery methods often fail to fully exploit the
latent information (e.g., human motion, shape alignment), leading to issues
with limb misalignment and insufficient local details in the reconstructed
human mesh (especially in complex scenes). Furthermore, the performance
improvement gained by modelling mesh vertices and pose node interactions using
attention mechanisms comes at a high computational cost. To address these
issues, we propose a two-stage network for human mesh recovery based on latent
information and low dimensional learning. Specifically, the first stage of the
network fully excavates global (e.g., the overall shape alignment) and local
(e.g., textures, detail) information from the low and high-frequency components
of image features and aggregates this information into a hybrid latent
frequency domain feature. This strategy effectively extracts latent
information. Subsequently, utilizing extracted hybrid latent frequency domain
features collaborates to enhance 2D poses to 3D learning. In the second stage,
with the assistance of hybrid latent features, we model the interaction
learning between the rough 3D human mesh template and the 3D pose, optimizing
the pose and shape of the human mesh. Unlike existing mesh pose interaction
methods, we design a low-dimensional mesh pose interaction method through
dimensionality reduction and parallel optimization that significantly reduces
computational costs without sacrificing reconstruction accuracy. Extensive
experimental results on large publicly available datasets indicate superiority
compared to the most state-of-the-art.

Conclusion: TreeFedDG框架有效解决了联邦域泛化中的全局漂移问题，通过分层知识利用和个性化融合策略显著提升了医学图像分割的跨域泛化能力。

Abstract: In medical image segmentation tasks, Domain Generalization (DG) under the
Federated Learning (FL) framework is crucial for addressing challenges related
to privacy protection and data heterogeneity. However, traditional federated
learning methods fail to account for the imbalance in information aggregation
across clients in cross-domain scenarios, leading to the Global Drift (GD)
problem and a consequent decline in model generalization performance. This
motivates us to delve deeper and define a new critical issue: global drift in
federated domain generalization for medical imaging (FedDG-GD). In this paper,
we propose a novel tree topology framework called TreeFedDG. First, starting
from the distributed characteristics of medical images, we design a
hierarchical parameter aggregation method based on a tree-structured topology
to suppress deviations in the global model direction. Second, we introduce a
parameter difference-based style mixing method (FedStyle), which enforces
mixing among clients with maximum parameter differences to enhance robustness
against drift. Third, we develop a a progressive personalized fusion strategy
during model distribution, ensuring a balance between knowledge transfer and
personalized features. Finally, during the inference phase, we use feature
similarity to guide the retrieval of the most relevant model chain from the
tree structure for ensemble decision-making, thereby fully leveraging the
advantages of hierarchical knowledge. We conducted extensive experiments on two
publicly available datasets. The results demonstrate that our method
outperforms other state-of-the-art domain generalization approaches in these
challenging tasks and achieves better balance in cross-domain performance.

### [40] [StreamingTOM: Streaming Token Compression for Efficient Video Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18269)
*Xueyi Chen,Keda Tao,Kele Shao,Huan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StreamingTOM是一个无需训练、即插即用的两阶段框架，通过因果时间缩减和在线量化内存技术，解决流式视频视觉语言模型中的因果性和累积性问题，显著降低计算和内存开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 流式视频视觉语言模型面临两个基本约束：因果性（无法访问未来帧）和累积性（token无限增长导致效率瓶颈）。现有方法只调节LLM后的kv缓存，而忽略了昂贵的LLM前预填充阶段。

Method: 提出两阶段框架：1) 因果时间缩减：基于相邻帧变化和token显著性选择token，每帧只处理紧凑的视觉token子集；2) 在线量化内存：以4位格式存储token，按需检索和解量化，保持活动kv缓存有界。

Result: 实验显示该方法实现15.7倍kv缓存压缩、1.2倍更低峰值内存和2倍更快的首token时间。在离线基准测试中平均准确率达63.8%，在RVS上达到55.8%/3.7，保持训练无关方法中的最先进精度。

Conclusion: StreamingTOM的两阶段方法为高效流式视频理解提供了实际优势，实现了有界增长的计算效率。

Abstract: Unlike offline processing, streaming video vision-language models face two
fundamental constraints: causality and accumulation. Causality prevents access
to future frames that offline methods exploit, while accumulation causes tokens
to grow unbounded, creating efficiency bottlenecks. However, existing
approaches only regulate post-LLM kv-cache, leaving costly pre-LLM prefill
unchanged. We introduce StreamingTOM, a training-free, plug-and-play two-stage
framework that addresses both pre-LLM and post-LLM bottlenecks with predictable
latency. Causal Temporal Reduction imposes a fixed per-frame budget and selects
tokens based on adjacent-frame changes and token saliency, drastically reducing
per-frame prefill cost by processing only a compact subset of visual tokens per
frame instead of all visual tokens. Online Quantized Memory stores tokens in
4-bit format, retrieves relevant groups on demand, and dequantizes them,
keeping the active kv-cache bounded regardless of stream length. Experiments
demonstrate our method achieves $15.7\times$ kv-cache compression, $1.2\times$
lower peak memory and $2\times$ faster TTFT compared to prior SOTA.
StreamingTOM maintains state-of-the-art accuracy among training-free methods
with an average of $63.8\%$ on offline benchmarks and $55.8\%/3.7$ on RVS.
These results highlight the practical benefits of our two-stage approach for
efficient streaming video understanding with bounded growth.

Motivation: 解决3D人脸身份保持编辑的挑战性问题，包括多视角一致性、高分辨率编辑的灵活性不足，以及需要大规模属性标记数据集的问题。

Method: 利用现有带掩码的人脸数据集获取合成图像，通过少量属性样本来估计潜在空间中的编辑方向，结合3D感知深度生成模型和2D人像编辑技术。

Result: 实验结果表明，仅需十张或更少的标记图像就足以估计对应3D感知属性编辑的潜在空间编辑方向，并展示了编辑的线性特性。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效缓解3D人脸编辑中的约束，实现高效的身份保持属性编辑，为3D一致的身份保持人脸老化等应用提供了连续风格流形。

Abstract: Identity preserving editing of faces is a generative task that enables
modifying the illumination, adding/removing eyeglasses, face aging, editing
hairstyles, modifying expression etc., while preserving the identity of the
face. Recent progress in 2D generative models have enabled photorealistic
editing of faces using simple techniques leveraging the compositionality in
GANs. However, identity preserving editing for 3D faces with a given set of
attributes is a challenging task as the generative model must reason about view
consistency from multiple poses and render a realistic 3D face. Further, 3D
portrait editing requires large-scale attribute labelled datasets and presents
a trade-off between editability in low-resolution and inflexibility to editing
in high resolution. In this work, we aim to alleviate some of the constraints
in editing 3D faces by identifying latent space directions that correspond to
photorealistic edits. To address this, we present a method that builds on
recent advancements in 3D-aware deep generative models and 2D portrait editing
techniques to perform efficient few-shot identity preserving attribute editing
for 3D-aware generative models. We aim to show from experimental results that
using just ten or fewer labelled images of an attribute is sufficient to
estimate edit directions in the latent space that correspond to 3D-aware
attribute editing. In this work, we leverage an existing face dataset with
masks to obtain the synthetic images for few attribute examples required for
estimating the edit directions. Further, to demonstrate the linearity of edits,
we investigate one-shot stylization by performing sequential editing and use
the (2D) Attribute Style Manipulation (ASM) technique to investigate a
continuous style manifold for 3D consistent identity preserving face aging.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种增强预训练扩散单目深度估计模型的新框架，通过立体视觉引导解决绝对度量深度估计的尺度模糊问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散单目深度估计方法在相对深度预测方面表现出色，但由于单图像场景中的尺度模糊问题，估计绝对度量深度仍然具有挑战性。

Method: 将深度估计重新定义为逆问题，利用预训练潜在扩散模型结合立体几何约束，学习尺度和偏移以实现精确深度恢复。这是一个无需训练的解决方案。

Result: 广泛实验表明，该方法在室内、室外和复杂环境中都能匹配或超越最先进方法，特别是在涉及半透明和镜面表面的挑战性场景中。

Conclusion: 该框架无需重新训练即可无缝集成到现有扩散单目深度估计框架中，并在各种环境中展现出优异的泛化能力。

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for metric depth estimation that enhances
pretrained diffusion-based monocular depth estimation (DB-MDE) models with
stereo vision guidance. While existing DB-MDE methods excel at predicting
relative depth, estimating absolute metric depth remains challenging due to
scale ambiguities in single-image scenarios. To address this, we reframe depth
estimation as an inverse problem, leveraging pretrained latent diffusion models
(LDMs) conditioned on RGB images, combined with stereo-based geometric
constraints, to learn scale and shift for accurate depth recovery. Our
training-free solution seamlessly integrates into existing DB-MDE frameworks
and generalizes across indoor, outdoor, and complex environments. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach matches or surpasses state-of-the-art
methods, particularly in challenging scenarios involving translucent and
specular surfaces, all without requiring retraining.

TL;DR: 提出了首个多模态医学推理检索框架Med-RwR，通过主动检索外部知识来增强多模态大语言模型的推理能力，特别是在医学诊断场景中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学MLLMs仅依赖内部知识进行推理，在遇到超出训练范围的病例时会产生幻觉推理和事实错误。现有Agentic RAG方法局限于单模态LLMs，忽略了关键的视觉信息。

Method: 设计了两阶段强化学习策略，使用定制奖励刺激模型利用视觉诊断发现和文本临床信息进行有效检索。进一步提出置信度驱动的图像重检索方法用于测试时扩展。

Result: 在多个公共医学基准测试中显著优于基线模型，在提出的ECBench上获得8.8%的性能提升，证明了对外部知识集成的有效性。

Conclusion: Med-RwR通过主动检索外部知识有效增强了医学MLLMs的推理能力，在陌生领域表现出卓越的泛化能力。

Abstract: Incentivizing the reasoning ability of Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) is essential for medical applications to transparently analyze medical
scans and provide reliable diagnosis. However, existing medical MLLMs rely
solely on internal knowledge during reasoning, leading to hallucinated
reasoning and factual inaccuracies when encountering cases beyond their
training scope. Although recent Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
methods elicit the medical model's proactive retrieval ability during
reasoning, they are confined to unimodal LLMs, neglecting the crucial visual
information during reasoning and retrieval. Consequently, we propose the first
Multimodal Medical Reasoning-with-Retrieval framework, Med-RwR, which actively
retrieves external knowledge by querying observed symptoms or domain-specific
medical concepts during reasoning. Specifically, we design a two-stage
reinforcement learning strategy with tailored rewards that stimulate the model
to leverage both visual diagnostic findings and textual clinical information
for effective retrieval. Building on this foundation, we further propose a
Confidence-Driven Image Re-retrieval (CDIR) method for test-time scaling when
low prediction confidence is detected. Evaluation on various public medical
benchmarks demonstrates Med-RwR's significant improvements over baseline
models, proving the effectiveness of enhancing reasoning capabilities with
external knowledge integration. Furthermore, Med-RwR demonstrates remarkable
generalizability to unfamiliar domains, evidenced by 8.8% performance gain on
our proposed EchoCardiography Benchmark (ECBench), despite the scarcity of
echocardiography data in the training corpus. Our data, model, and codes will
be made publicly available at https://github.com/xmed-lab/Med-RwR.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLM主要针对低分辨率通用数据集设计，在生物医学高分辨率图像分析中可能导致关键信息丢失，需要研究分辨率对性能的影响。

Method: 通过实验研究图像分辨率对MLLM性能的影响，包括原生分辨率训练推理、分辨率不匹配测试以及混合分辨率训练策略。

Result: 原生分辨率训练和推理显著提升多任务性能；训练与推理分辨率不匹配会严重降低性能；混合分辨率训练能有效缓解不匹配问题并平衡计算约束与性能需求。

Conclusion: 建议优先采用原生分辨率推理和混合分辨率数据集，以优化生物医学MLLM在科学研究和临床应用中的影响力。

Abstract: Imaging technologies are fundamental to biomedical research and modern
medicine, requiring analysis of high-resolution images across various
modalities. While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show promise for
biomedical image analysis, most are designed for low-resolution images from
general-purpose datasets, risking critical information loss. We investigate how
image resolution affects MLLM performance in biomedical applications and
demonstrate that: (1) native-resolution training and inference significantly
improve performance across multiple tasks, (2) misalignment between training
and inference resolutions severely degrades performance, and (3)
mixed-resolution training effectively mitigates misalignment and balances
computational constraints with performance requirements. Based on these
findings, we recommend prioritizing native-resolution inference and
mixed-resolution datasets to optimize biomedical MLLMs for transformative
impact in scientific research and clinical applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OmniNWM是一个全景导航世界模型，在状态、动作和奖励三个维度上统一处理，通过全景视频生成、精确动作控制和基于3D占用率的奖励机制，实现了自动驾驶世界模型的全面改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动驾驶世界模型存在状态模态有限、视频序列短、动作控制不精确、缺乏奖励意识等问题，需要开发一个统一框架来解决这些核心维度的限制。

Method: 使用全景Plucker射线图表示编码输入轨迹，联合生成RGB、语义、度量深度和3D占用率的全景视频，通过强制策略实现长时域自回归生成，并利用生成的3D占用率直接定义基于规则的密集奖励。

Result: OmniNWM在视频生成、控制精度和长时域稳定性方面达到最先进性能，通过基于占用率的奖励提供了可靠的闭环评估框架。

Conclusion: OmniNWM成功解决了自动驾驶世界模型在状态、动作和奖励三个核心维度的限制，为自动驾驶系统提供了一个全面且可靠的世界模型解决方案。

Abstract: Autonomous driving world models are expected to work effectively across three
core dimensions: state, action, and reward. Existing models, however, are
typically restricted to limited state modalities, short video sequences,
imprecise action control, and a lack of reward awareness. In this paper, we
introduce OmniNWM, an omniscient panoramic navigation world model that
addresses all three dimensions within a unified framework. For state, OmniNWM
jointly generates panoramic videos of RGB, semantics, metric depth, and 3D
occupancy. A flexible forcing strategy enables high-quality long-horizon
auto-regressive generation. For action, we introduce a normalized panoramic
Plucker ray-map representation that encodes input trajectories into pixel-level
signals, enabling highly precise and generalizable control over panoramic video
generation. Regarding reward, we move beyond learning reward functions with
external image-based models: instead, we leverage the generated 3D occupancy to
directly define rule-based dense rewards for driving compliance and safety.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that OmniNWM achieves state-of-the-art
performance in video generation, control accuracy, and long-horizon stability,
while providing a reliable closed-loop evaluation framework through
occupancy-grounded rewards. Project page is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在图像描述和视觉问答等任务中表现出色，但仍容易产生对象幻觉——描述不存在或识别错误的物体。现有方法在可扩展性、适应性和模型独立性方面存在局限。

Method: ATED是一种训练免费的令牌级集成框架，在推理过程中通过动态计算基于不确定性的权重来聚合多个模型的预测，并整合多样化的解码路径以提高上下文基础和语义一致性。

Result: 在标准幻觉检测基准测试中，ATED显著优于最先进的方法，在不影响流畅性或相关性的情况下减少了幻觉现象。

Conclusion: 自适应集成方法为改善大型视觉语言模型在高风险应用中的鲁棒性提供了一个有前景的方向。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have recently achieved impressive
results in multimodal tasks such as image captioning and visual question
answering. However, they remain prone to object hallucination -- generating
descriptions of nonexistent or misidentified objects. Prior work has partially
mitigated this via auxiliary training objectives or external modules, but
challenges remain in terms of scalability, adaptability, and model
independence. To address these limitations, we propose Adaptive Token Ensemble
Decoding (ATED), a training-free, token-level ensemble framework that mitigates
hallucination by aggregating predictions from multiple LVLMs during inference.
ATED dynamically computes uncertainty-based weights for each model, reflecting
their reliability at each decoding step. It also integrates diverse decoding
paths to improve contextual grounding and semantic consistency. Experiments on
standard hallucination detection benchmarks demonstrate that ATED significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, reducing hallucination without
compromising fluency or relevance. Our findings highlight the benefits of
adaptive ensembling and point to a promising direction for improving LVLM
robustness in high-stakes applications. The code is available at

Conclusion: ATTBHFA-Net通过概率分布层面的对比学习，有效解决了灾难图像少样本分类的挑战，为灾难响应提供了更可靠的视觉识别技术。

Abstract: The increasing frequency of natural and human-induced disasters necessitates
advanced visual recognition techniques capable of analyzing critical
photographic data. With progress in artificial intelligence and resilient
computational systems, rapid and accurate disaster classification has become
crucial for efficient rescue operations. However, visual recognition in
disaster contexts faces significant challenges due to limited and diverse data
from the difficulties in collecting and curating comprehensive, high-quality
disaster imagery. Few-Shot Learning (FSL) provides a promising approach to data
scarcity, yet current FSL research mainly relies on generic benchmark datasets
lacking remote-sensing disaster imagery, limiting its practical effectiveness.
Moreover, disaster images exhibit high intra-class variation and inter-class
similarity, hindering the performance of conventional metric-based FSL methods.
To address these issues, this paper introduces the Attention-based
Bhattacharyya-Hellinger Feature Aggregation Network (ATTBHFA-Net), which
linearly combines the Bhattacharyya coefficient and Hellinger distances to
compare and aggregate feature probability distributions for robust prototype
formation. The Bhattacharyya coefficient serves as a contrastive margin that
enhances inter-class separability, while the Hellinger distance regularizes
same-class alignment. This framework parallels contrastive learning but
operates over probability distributions rather than embedded feature points.
Furthermore, a Bhattacharyya-Hellinger distance-based contrastive loss is
proposed as a distributional counterpart to cosine similarity loss, used
jointly with categorical cross-entropy to significantly improve FSL
performance. Experiments on four FSL benchmarks and two disaster image datasets
demonstrate the superior effectiveness and generalization of ATTBHFA-Net
compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Realistic view extrapolation is critical for closed-loop simulation in

local minima. Second, we inject strong geometric priors by modeling the road
surface with a novel dimension-reduced SDF termed 2D-SDF. Third, we leverage a
generative prior to create pseudo ground truth for extrapolated viewpoints,
providing auxilary supervision. Finally, a data-driven adaptation network
removes time-specific artifacts. On the RealADSim-NVS benchmark, our method
achieves a final score of 0.441, ranking first among all participants.

Abstract: Compared to the prosperity of pre-training models in natural image
understanding, the research on large-scale pre-training models for facial
knowledge learning is still limited. Current approaches mainly rely on manually
assembled and annotated face datasets for training, but labeling such datasets
is labor-intensive and the trained models have limited scalability beyond the
training data. To address these limitations, we present a generative
pre-training model for facial knowledge learning that leverages large-scale
web-built data for training. We use texts and images containing human faces
crawled from the internet and conduct pre-training on self-supervised tasks,
including masked image/language modeling (MILM) and image-text matching (ITM).
During the generation stage, we further utilize the image-text matching loss to
pull the generation distribution towards the control signal for controllable
image/text generation. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves
comparable performance to state-of-the-art pre-training models for various
facial downstream tasks, such as attribution classification and expression
recognition. Furthermore, our approach is also applicable to a wide range of
face editing tasks, including face attribute editing, expression manipulation,
mask removal, and photo inpainting.

Conclusion: AV-Master通过动态时间采样和模态偏好建模有效解决了音视频问答中的关键信息提取问题，为复杂场景推理提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Audio-Visual Question Answering (AVQA) requires models to effectively utilize
both visual and auditory modalities to answer complex and diverse questions
about audio-visual scenes. However, existing methods lack sufficient
flexibility and dynamic adaptability in temporal sampling and modality
preference awareness, making it difficult to focus on key information based on
the question. This limits their reasoning capability in complex scenarios. To
address these challenges, we propose a novel framework named AV-Master. It
enhances the model's ability to extract key information from complex
audio-visual scenes with substantial redundant content by dynamically modeling
both temporal and modality dimensions. In the temporal dimension, we introduce
a dynamic adaptive focus sampling mechanism that progressively focuses on
audio-visual segments most relevant to the question, effectively mitigating
redundancy and segment fragmentation in traditional sampling methods. In the
modality dimension, we propose a preference-aware strategy that models each
modality's contribution independently, enabling selective activation of
critical features. Furthermore, we introduce a dual-path contrastive loss to
reinforce consistency and complementarity across temporal and modality
dimensions, guiding the model to learn question-specific cross-modal
collaborative representations. Experiments on four large-scale benchmarks show
that AV-Master significantly outperforms existing methods, especially in
complex reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Direct preference optimization (DPO) methods have shown strong potential in
aligning text-to-image diffusion models with human preferences by training on
paired comparisons. These methods improve training stability by avoiding the
REINFORCE algorithm but still struggle with challenges such as accurately
estimating image probabilities due to the non-linear nature of the sigmoid
function and the limited diversity of offline datasets. In this paper, we
introduce Diffusion Denoising Ranking Optimization (Diffusion-DRO), a new
preference learning framework grounded in inverse reinforcement learning.
Diffusion-DRO removes the dependency on a reward model by casting preference
learning as a ranking problem, thereby simplifying the training objective into
a denoising formulation and overcoming the non-linear estimation issues found
in prior methods. Moreover, Diffusion-DRO uniquely integrates offline expert
demonstrations with online policy-generated negative samples, enabling it to
effectively capture human preferences while addressing the limitations of
offline data. Comprehensive experiments show that Diffusion-DRO delivers
improved generation quality across a range of challenging and unseen prompts,
outperforming state-of-the-art baselines in both both quantitative metrics and
user studies. Our source code and pre-trained models are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的人-物交互检测方法主要关注成对关系，忽略了现实场景中交互往往来自多个人类和物体参与的集体行为。

Method: 提出GroupHOI框架：1）使用基于边界框空间特征的可学习邻近性估计器将人和物体分组；2）在每个组内通过自注意力计算软对应关系来聚合和分发上下文线索；3）在基于Transformer的交互解码器中加入来自HO对特征的局部上下文线索。

Conclusion: 从群体视角重新审视关系建模能够有效提升人-物交互检测性能，特别是在涉及高阶交互的复杂场景中。

Abstract: Human-Object Interaction Detection (HOI-DET) aims to localize human-object
pairs and identify their interactive relationships. To aggregate contextual
cues, existing methods typically propagate information across all detected
entities via self-attention mechanisms, or establish message passing between
humans and objects with bipartite graphs. However, they primarily focus on
pairwise relationships, overlooking that interactions in real-world scenarios
often emerge from collective behaviors (multiple humans and objects engaging in
joint activities). In light of this, we revisit relation modeling from a group
view and propose GroupHOI, a framework that propagates contextual information
in terms of geometric proximity and semantic similarity. To exploit the
geometric proximity, humans and objects are grouped into distinct clusters
using a learnable proximity estimator based on spatial features derived from
bounding boxes. In each group, a soft correspondence is computed via
self-attention to aggregate and dispatch contextual cues. To incorporate the

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了FeatureFool，一种针对视频模型的零查询黑盒攻击方法，通过利用DNN提取的特征信息来改变干净视频的特征空间，无需与模型进行多轮交互。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有黑盒攻击需要多轮交互和大量查询，这在现实世界中不实用且难以扩展到Video-LLMs。视频领域缺乏直接利用特征映射来改变干净视频特征空间的攻击方法。

Method: 利用从DNN提取的信息直接改变干净视频的特征空间，实现零查询攻击。通过特征映射的迁移性来绕过Video-LLM识别。

Result: 对传统视频分类器的攻击成功率超过70%，无需任何查询。生成的对抗视频在SSIM、PSNR和时间一致性方面质量高，攻击几乎不可察觉。

Conclusion: FeatureFool是一种高效、隐蔽的视频领域零查询黑盒攻击方法，能够成功攻击传统视频分类器和Video-LLMs，同时保持高视觉质量。

Abstract: The vulnerability of deep neural networks (DNNs) has been preliminarily
verified. Existing black-box adversarial attacks usually require multi-round
interaction with the model and consume numerous queries, which is impractical
in the real-world and hard to scale to recently emerged Video-LLMs. Moreover,
no attack in the video domain directly leverages feature maps to shift the
clean-video feature space. We therefore propose FeatureFool, a stealthy,
video-domain, zero-query black-box attack that utilizes information extracted
from a DNN to alter the feature space of clean videos. Unlike query-based
methods that rely on iterative interaction, FeatureFool performs a zero-query
attack by directly exploiting DNN-extracted information. This efficient
approach is unprecedented in the video domain. Experiments show that
FeatureFool achieves an attack success rate above 70\% against traditional
video classifiers without any queries. Benefiting from the transferability of
the feature map, it can also craft harmful content and bypass Video-LLM
recognition. Additionally, adversarial videos generated by FeatureFool exhibit
high quality in terms of SSIM, PSNR, and Temporal-Inconsistency, making the
attack barely perceptible. This paper may contain violent or explicit content.

Motivation: 现有ICA方法主要依赖单模态的视觉特征，无法充分捕捉与图像复杂度相关的感知表示。跨模态场景语义信息在其他计算机视觉任务中表现出重要作用，但在ICA领域尚未被探索。

Method: CM-SSA包含复杂度回归分支和场景语义对齐分支。回归分支在语义对齐分支的指导下估计图像复杂度，语义对齐分支通过成对学习将图像与传达丰富场景语义信息的文本提示对齐。

Result: 在多个ICA数据集上的广泛实验表明，CM-SSA显著优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 跨模态场景语义对齐能够有效提升图像复杂度评估性能，使预测结果更符合人类主观感知。

Abstract: Image complexity assessment (ICA) is a challenging task in perceptual
evaluation due to the subjective nature of human perception and the inherent
semantic diversity in real-world images. Existing ICA methods predominantly
rely on hand-crafted or shallow convolutional neural network-based features of
a single visual modality, which are insufficient to fully capture the perceived
representations closely related to image complexity. Recently, cross-modal
scene semantic information has been shown to play a crucial role in various
computer vision tasks, particularly those involving perceptual understanding.
However, the exploration of cross-modal scene semantic information in the
context of ICA remains unaddressed. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a
novel ICA method called Cross-Modal Scene Semantic Alignment (CM-SSA), which
leverages scene semantic alignment from a cross-modal perspective to enhance
ICA performance, enabling complexity predictions to be more consistent with
subjective human perception. Specifically, the proposed CM-SSA consists of a
complexity regression branch and a scene semantic alignment branch. The
complexity regression branch estimates image complexity levels under the
guidance of the scene semantic alignment branch, while the scene semantic
alignment branch is used to align images with corresponding text prompts that
convey rich scene semantic information by pair-wise learning. Extensive
experiments on several ICA datasets demonstrate that the proposed CM-SSA
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. Codes are available at

Conclusion: S2AP方法通过分数空间锐度最小化解决了对抗性剪枝中的掩码选择不稳定问题，显著提升了剪枝模型的鲁棒性

Abstract: Adversarial pruning methods have emerged as a powerful tool for compressing
neural networks while preserving robustness against adversarial attacks. These
methods typically follow a three-step pipeline: (i) pretrain a robust model,
(ii) select a binary mask for weight pruning, and (iii) finetune the pruned
model. To select the binary mask, these methods minimize a robust loss by
assigning an importance score to each weight, and then keep the weights with
the highest scores. However, this score-space optimization can lead to sharp
local minima in the robust loss landscape and, in turn, to an unstable mask
selection, reducing the robustness of adversarial pruning methods. To overcome
this issue, we propose a novel plug-in method for adversarial pruning, termed
Score-space Sharpness-aware Adversarial Pruning (S2AP). Through our method, we
introduce the concept of score-space sharpness minimization, which operates
during the mask search by perturbing importance scores and minimizing the
corresponding robust loss. Extensive experiments across various datasets,
models, and sparsity levels demonstrate that S2AP effectively minimizes
sharpness in score space, stabilizing the mask selection, and ultimately
improving the robustness of adversarial pruning methods.

Abstract: Background and Objective: In brain imaging, geometric surface models are
essential for analyzing the 3D shapes of anatomical structures. Alzheimer's
disease (AD) is associated with significant cortical atrophy, making such shape
analysis a valuable diagnostic tool. The objective of this study is to
introduce and validate a novel local surface representation method for the
automated and accurate diagnosis of AD. Methods: The study utilizes T1-weighted
MRI scans from 160 participants (80 AD patients and 80 healthy controls) from
the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Cortical surface models
were reconstructed from the MRI data using Freesurfer. Key geometric attributes
were computed from the 3D meshes. Area distortion and conformal factor were
derived using Ricci flow for conformal parameterization, while Gaussian
curvature was calculated directly from the mesh geometry. Shannon entropy was
applied to these three features to create compact and informative feature
vectors. The feature vectors were used to train and evaluate a suite of
classifiers (e.g. XGBoost, MLP, Logistic Regression, etc.). Results:
Statistical significance of performance differences between classifiers was
evaluated using paired Welch's t-test. The method proved highly effective in
distinguishing AD patients from healthy controls. The Multi-Layer Perceptron
(MLP) and Logistic Regression classifiers outperformed all others, achieving an
accuracy and F$_1$ Score of 98.62%. Conclusions: This study confirms that the
entropy of conformally-derived geometric features provides a powerful and
robust metric for cortical morphometry. The high classification accuracy
underscores the method's potential to enhance the study and diagnosis of
Alzheimer's disease, offering a straightforward yet powerful tool for clinical
research applications.

Conclusion: BFCTN方法有效解决了传统张量分解融合方法的局限性，通过概率建模和自动参数学习实现了更好的融合性能和实用性。

Abstract: Tensor decomposition is a powerful tool for data analysis and has been
extensively employed in the field of hyperspectral-multispectral image fusion
(HMF). Existing tensor decomposition-based fusion methods typically rely on
disruptive data vectorization/reshaping or impose rigid constraints on the
arrangement of factor tensors, hindering the preservation of spatial-spectral
structures and the modeling of cross-dimensional correlations. Although recent
advances utilizing the Fully-Connected Tensor Network (FCTN) decomposition have
partially alleviated these limitations, the process of reorganizing data into
higher-order tensors still disrupts the intrinsic spatial-spectral structure.
Furthermore, these methods necessitate extensive manual parameter tuning and
exhibit limited robustness against noise and spatial degradation. To alleviate
these issues, we propose the Bayesian FCTN (BFCTN) method. Within this
probabilistic framework, a hierarchical sparse prior that characterizing the
sparsity of physical elements, establishes connections between the factor
tensors. This framework explicitly models the intrinsic physical coupling among
spatial structures, spectral signatures, and local scene homogeneity. For model
learning, we develop a parameter estimation method based on Variational
Bayesian inference (VB) and the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm, which
significantly reduces the need for manual parameter tuning. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that BFCTN not only achieves state-of-the-art fusion
accuracy and strong robustness but also exhibits practical applicability in
complex real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: ScaleNet为ViT模型扩展提供了高效解决方案，在图像分类和目标检测等下游视觉任务中具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Recent advancements in vision transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated that
larger models often achieve superior performance. However, training these
models remains computationally intensive and costly. To address this challenge,
we introduce ScaleNet, an efficient approach for scaling ViT models. Unlike
conventional training from scratch, ScaleNet facilitates rapid model expansion
with negligible increases in parameters, building on existing pretrained
models. This offers a cost-effective solution for scaling up ViTs.
Specifically, ScaleNet achieves model expansion by inserting additional layers
into pretrained ViTs, utilizing layer-wise weight sharing to maintain
parameters efficiency. Each added layer shares its parameter tensor with a
corresponding layer from the pretrained model. To mitigate potential
performance degradation due to shared weights, ScaleNet introduces a small set
of adjustment parameters for each layer. These adjustment parameters are
implemented through parallel adapter modules, ensuring that each instance of
the shared parameter tensor remains distinct and optimized for its specific
function. Experiments on the ImageNet-1K dataset demonstrate that ScaleNet
enables efficient expansion of ViT models. With a 2$\times$ depth-scaled
DeiT-Base model, ScaleNet achieves a 7.42% accuracy improvement over training
from scratch while requiring only one-third of the training epochs,
highlighting its efficiency in scaling ViTs. Beyond image classification, our
method shows significant potential for application in downstream vision areas,
as evidenced by the validation in object detection task.

Abstract: We introduce ImageGem, a dataset for studying generative models that
understand fine-grained individual preferences. We posit that a key challenge
hindering the development of such a generative model is the lack of in-the-wild
and fine-grained user preference annotations. Our dataset features real-world
interaction data from 57K users, who collectively have built 242K customized
LoRAs, written 3M text prompts, and created 5M generated images. With user
preference annotations from our dataset, we were able to train better
preference alignment models. In addition, leveraging individual user
preference, we investigated the performance of retrieval models and a
vision-language model on personalized image retrieval and generative model
recommendation. Finally, we propose an end-to-end framework for editing
customized diffusion models in a latent weight space to align with individual
user preferences. Our results demonstrate that the ImageGem dataset enables,
for the first time, a new paradigm for generative model personalization.

Motivation: 现有COD方法主要依赖图像级建模或基于标注的优化，难以利用有价值的数据集级上下文信息，且依赖费力的标注工作。

Method: 提出RISE方法：1）通过聚类-检索策略构建环境和伪装对象的原型库；2）使用多视图KNN检索生成鲁棒伪掩码；3）包含聚类生成粗掩码、直方图图像过滤和跨类别检索等步骤。

Result: 大量实验表明，RISE在无监督和基于提示的方法中优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: RISE通过检索自增强范式有效利用数据集级信息，无需人工标注即可生成高质量伪标签，为伪装目标检测提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: At the core of Camouflaged Object Detection (COD) lies segmenting objects
from their highly similar surroundings. Previous efforts navigate this
challenge primarily through image-level modeling or annotation-based
optimization. Despite advancing considerably, this commonplace practice hardly
taps valuable dataset-level contextual information or relies on laborious
annotations. In this paper, we propose RISE, a RetrIeval SElf-augmented
paradigm that exploits the entire training dataset to generate pseudo-labels
for single images, which could be used to train COD models. RISE begins by
constructing prototype libraries for environments and camouflaged objects using
training images (without ground truth), followed by K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)
retrieval to generate pseudo-masks for each image based on these libraries. It
is important to recognize that using only training images without annotations
exerts a pronounced challenge in crafting high-quality prototype libraries. In
this light, we introduce a Clustering-then-Retrieval (CR) strategy, where
coarse masks are first generated through clustering, facilitating subsequent
histogram-based image filtering and cross-category retrieval to produce
high-confidence prototypes. In the KNN retrieval stage, to alleviate the effect
of artifacts in feature maps, we propose Multi-View KNN Retrieval (MVKR), which
integrates retrieval results from diverse views to produce more robust and
precise pseudo-masks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RISE outperforms
state-of-the-art unsupervised and prompt-based methods. Code is available at

volumetric images of size 256x256x256 at 1 mm isotropic resolution using a

existing approaches. The conditioning masks delineate lung and nodule regions,
enabling precise control over the output anatomical features. Experimental
results demonstrate that conditioning solely on nodule masks leads to
anatomically incorrect outputs, highlighting the importance of incorporating
global lung structure for accurate conditional synthesis. The proposed approach
supports the generation of diverse CT volumes with and without lung nodules of
varying attributes, providing a valuable tool for training AI models or

Motivation: 现有基于蒸馏的方法会削弱与原始视觉基础模型的语义对齐，导致在分布偏移时潜在表示出现语义偏差，需要更直接的集成方法。

Method: 设计VFM-VAE变分自编码器，采用多尺度潜在融合和渐进分辨率重建模块，从空间粗糙的VFM特征实现高质量重建；提出SE-CKNNA指标分析表示动态，开发联合tokenizer-扩散对齐策略。

Result: 在80个epoch内达到gFID 2.20（无CFG），比现有tokenizer快10倍；640个epoch后达到gFID 1.62，性能显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 直接集成VFM是LDMs的优越范式，在性能和效率上都超越了基于蒸馏的方法。

Abstract: The performance of Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) is critically dependent on
the quality of their visual tokenizer. While recent works have explored
incorporating Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) via distillation, we identify a
fundamental flaw in this approach: it inevitably weakens the robustness of
alignment with the original VFM, causing the aligned latents to deviate
semantically under distribution shifts. In this paper, we bypass distillation
by proposing a more direct approach: Vision Foundation Model Variational
Autoencoder (VFM-VAE). To resolve the inherent tension between the VFM's
semantic focus and the need for pixel-level fidelity, we redesign the VFM-VAE
decoder with Multi-Scale Latent Fusion and Progressive Resolution
Reconstruction blocks, enabling high-quality reconstruction from spatially
coarse VFM features. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive analysis of
representation dynamics during diffusion training, introducing the proposed
SE-CKNNA metric as a more precise tool for this diagnosis. This analysis allows
us to develop a joint tokenizer-diffusion alignment strategy that dramatically
accelerates convergence. Our innovations in tokenizer design and training
strategy lead to superior performance and efficiency: our system reaches a gFID
(w/o CFG) of 2.20 in merely 80 epochs (a 10x speedup over prior tokenizers).
With continued training to 640 epochs, it further attains a gFID (w/o CFG) of
1.62, establishing direct VFM integration as a superior paradigm for LDMs.

Abstract: We introduce Mono4DGS-HDR, the first system for reconstructing renderable 4D
high dynamic range (HDR) scenes from unposed monocular low dynamic range (LDR)
videos captured with alternating exposures. To tackle such a challenging
problem, we present a unified framework with two-stage optimization approach
based on Gaussian Splatting. The first stage learns a video HDR Gaussian
representation in orthographic camera coordinate space, eliminating the need
for camera poses and enabling robust initial HDR video reconstruction. The
second stage transforms video Gaussians into world space and jointly refines
the world Gaussians with camera poses. Furthermore, we propose a temporal
luminance regularization strategy to enhance the temporal consistency of the
HDR appearance. Since our task has not been studied before, we construct a new
evaluation benchmark using publicly available datasets for HDR video
reconstruction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Mono4DGS-HDR
significantly outperforms alternative solutions adapted from state-of-the-art
methods in both rendering quality and speed.

Abstract: Vehicle make and model recognition (VMMR) is an important task in intelligent
transportation systems, but existing approaches struggle to adapt to newly
released models. Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) provides strong
visual-text alignment, yet its fixed pretrained weights limit performance
without costly image-specific finetuning. We propose a pipeline that integrates
vision language models (VLMs) with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to
support zero-shot recognition through text-based reasoning. A VLM converts
vehicle images into descriptive attributes, which are compared against a
database of textual features. Relevant entries are retrieved and combined with
the description to form a prompt, and a language model (LM) infers the make and
model. This design avoids large-scale retraining and enables rapid updates by
adding textual descriptions of new vehicles. Experiments show that the proposed
method improves recognition by nearly 20% over the CLIP baseline, demonstrating
the potential of RAG-enhanced LM reasoning for scalable VMMR in smart-city
applications.

Result: EfficientNetV2S分类器准确率最高（96%）但延迟高；轻量级目标检测模型mAP达77%，推理速度快（0.03s），模型小（<7MB）；量化可减少75%模型大小和VRAM使用。

Conclusion: 成功实现"绿色AI"模型，支持在边缘设备上进行实时、可持续的垃圾分类。

Abstract: The rise of convenience packaging has led to generation of enormous waste,
making efficient waste sorting crucial for sustainable waste management. To
address this, we developed DWaste, a computer vision-powered platform designed
for real-time waste sorting on resource-constrained smartphones and edge
devices, including offline functionality. We benchmarked various image
classification models (EfficientNetV2S/M, ResNet50/101, MobileNet) and object
detection (YOLOv8n, YOLOv11n) using a subset of our own waste data set and
annotated it using the custom tool Annotated Lab. We found a clear trade-off
between accuracy and resource consumption: the best classifier,
EfficientNetV2S, achieved high accuracy (~ 96%) but suffered from high latency
(~ 0.22s) and elevated carbon emissions. In contrast, lightweight object
detection models delivered strong performance (up to 77% mAP) with ultra-fast
inference (~ 0.03s) and significantly smaller model sizes (< 7MB), making them
ideal for real-time, low-power use. Model quantization further maximized
efficiency, substantially reducing model size and VRAM usage by up to 75%. Our
work demonstrates the successful implementation of "Greener AI" models to
support real-time, sustainable waste sorting on edge devices.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于扩散变换器的模板物体姿态估计方法，将姿态估计重新表述为射线对齐问题，通过多视角模板图像学习与查询图像的对齐，在多个基准数据集上取得了有竞争力的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于模板的物体姿态估计方法在检索错误模板时会导致姿态预测不准确，因此需要一种更稳健的方法来改进模板匹配和姿态对齐的可靠性。

Method: 将模板物体姿态估计重新表述为射线对齐问题，使用扩散变换器架构对齐查询图像与姿态模板集，采用物体中心相机射线重新参数化旋转，并将尺度不变平移估计扩展到密集平移偏移。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法在未见物体姿态估计任务中相比最先进方法取得了有竞争力的结果。

Conclusion: 提出的基于扩散变换器的射线对齐方法能够有效利用模板的几何先验指导准确的查询姿态推断，通过粗到细的训练策略在不改变网络架构的情况下提升了性能。

Abstract: Typical template-based object pose pipelines estimate the pose by retrieving
the closest matching template and aligning it with the observed image. However,
failure to retrieve the correct template often leads to inaccurate pose
predictions. To address this, we reformulate template-based object pose
estimation as a ray alignment problem, where the viewing directions from
multiple posed template images are learned to align with a non-posed query
image. Inspired by recent progress in diffusion-based camera pose estimation,
we embed this formulation into a diffusion transformer architecture that aligns
a query image with a set of posed templates. We reparameterize object rotation
using object-centered camera rays and model object translation by extending
scale-invariant translation estimation to dense translation offsets. Our model
leverages geometric priors from the templates to guide accurate query pose
inference. A coarse-to-fine training strategy based on narrowed template
sampling improves performance without modifying the network architecture.
Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets show competitive
results of our method compared to state-of-the-art approaches in unseen object
pose estimation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该技术报告介绍了在RoboSense 2025 Track 3中排名第一的解决方案，通过使用GBlobs局部点云特征描述符来提升3D目标检测模型在不同LiDAR配置下的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于LiDAR的3D检测器在训练时存在"几何捷径"问题，模型过度依赖绝对笛卡尔坐标而非物体的形状和外观特征，这导致在不同传感器配置下泛化能力严重受限。

Method: 使用GBlobs作为网络输入特征，这是一种专门设计的局部点云特征描述符，能够有效规避几何捷径问题，迫使网络学习鲁棒的、以物体为中心的表示。

Result: 该方法显著提升了模型的泛化能力，在挑战中表现出卓越的性能，实现了最先进的3D目标检测效果。

Conclusion: GBlobs特征描述符通过消除位置偏差，使3D检测模型能够更好地学习物体本质特征，从而在不同传感器配置下保持稳定的检测性能。

Abstract: This technical report outlines the top-ranking solution for RoboSense 2025:
Track 3, achieving state-of-the-art performance on 3D object detection under
various sensor placements. Our submission utilizes GBlobs, a local point cloud
feature descriptor specifically designed to enhance model generalization across
diverse LiDAR configurations. Current LiDAR-based 3D detectors often suffer
from a \enquote{geometric shortcut} when trained on conventional global
features (\ie, absolute Cartesian coordinates). This introduces a position bias
that causes models to primarily rely on absolute object position rather than
distinguishing shape and appearance characteristics. Although effective for
in-domain data, this shortcut severely limits generalization when encountering
different point distributions, such as those resulting from varying sensor
placements. By using GBlobs as network input features, we effectively
circumvent this geometric shortcut, compelling the network to learn robust,
object-centric representations. This approach significantly enhances the
model's ability to generalize, resulting in the exceptional performance
demonstrated in this challenge.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动驾驶数据集虽然包含传感器噪声和环境变化，但缺乏可控、参数化和可重复的多传感器退化方法，限制了在明确不利条件下系统评估感知和融合架构性能的能力。

Method: 为相机模态发布完整版和迷你版，包含四种遮挡类型；为雷达和LiDAR提供参数化遮挡脚本，每种实现三种退化类型，支持灵活可重复生成遮挡数据。

Result: 创建了首个具有可控和可重复退化的多传感器遮挡数据集，支持一致、可重复的感知模型评估。

Conclusion: 该资源旨在推动自动驾驶中鲁棒传感器融合、弹性分析和安全关键感知的研究进展。

Abstract: Robust perception in automated driving requires reliable performance under
adverse conditions, where sensors may be affected by partial failures or
environmental occlusions. Although existing autonomous driving datasets
inherently contain sensor noise and environmental variability, very few enable
controlled, parameterised, and reproducible degradations across multiple
sensing modalities. This gap limits the ability to systematically evaluate how
perception and fusion architectures perform under well-defined adverse
conditions. To address this limitation, we introduce the Occluded nuScenes
Dataset, a novel extension of the widely used nuScenes benchmark. For the
camera modality, we release both the full and mini versions with four types of
occlusions, two adapted from public implementations and two newly designed. For
radar and LiDAR, we provide parameterised occlusion scripts that implement
three types of degradations each, enabling flexible and repeatable generation
of occluded data. This resource supports consistent, reproducible evaluation of
perception models under partial sensor failures and environmental interference.
By releasing the first multi-sensor occlusion dataset with controlled and
reproducible degradations, we aim to advance research on robust sensor fusion,
resilience analysis, and safety-critical perception in automated driving.

TL;DR: Kaleido是一个主题到视频生成框架，通过多参考图像合成主题一致的视频，解决了多主题一致性和背景解耦的挑战


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有主题到视频生成方法在多主题一致性和背景解耦方面存在不足，导致参考保真度低和语义漂移问题，主要原因是训练数据缺乏多样性和多图像集成机制不理想

Method: 提出专用数据构建流程进行低质量样本过滤和多样化数据合成，并引入参考旋转位置编码来处理参考图像，实现稳定精确的多图像集成

Result: 在多个基准测试上的广泛实验表明，Kaleido在一致性、保真度和泛化能力方面显著优于先前方法

Conclusion: Kaleido在主题到视频生成领域取得了重要进展，为多主题一致性视频生成提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: We present Kaleido, a subject-to-video~(S2V) generation framework, which aims
to synthesize subject-consistent videos conditioned on multiple reference
images of target subjects. Despite recent progress in S2V generation models,
existing approaches remain inadequate at maintaining multi-subject consistency
and at handling background disentanglement, often resulting in lower reference
fidelity and semantic drift under multi-image conditioning. These shortcomings
can be attributed to several factors. Primarily, the training dataset suffers
from a lack of diversity and high-quality samples, as well as cross-paired
data, i.e., paired samples whose components originate from different instances.
In addition, the current mechanism for integrating multiple reference images is
suboptimal, potentially resulting in the confusion of multiple subjects. To
overcome these limitations, we propose a dedicated data construction pipeline,
incorporating low-quality sample filtering and diverse data synthesis, to
produce consistency-preserving training data. Moreover, we introduce Reference
Rotary Positional Encoding (R-RoPE) to process reference images, enabling
stable and precise multi-image integration. Extensive experiments across
numerous benchmarks demonstrate that Kaleido significantly outperforms previous
methods in consistency, fidelity, and generalization, marking an advance in S2V
generation.

Motivation: 多模态数据集蒸馏面临跨模态对齐和高计算成本的挑战。现有方法冻结文本编码器限制了语义对齐，成为性能扩展的瓶颈。

Method: 提出CovMatch框架，对齐真实和合成特征的交叉协方差，正则化各模态内特征分布，支持联合优化两个编码器。

Result: 在Flickr30K和COCO数据集上，CovMatch优于现有多模态蒸馏方法，仅使用500个合成对就能在检索准确率上获得高达6.8%的绝对增益。

Conclusion: CovMatch通过联合优化编码器和交叉协方差对齐，有效解决了多模态数据集蒸馏中的语义对齐瓶颈问题。

Abstract: Multimodal dataset distillation aims to synthesize a small set of image-text
pairs that enables efficient training of large-scale vision-language models.
While dataset distillation has shown promise in unimodal tasks, extending it to
multimodal contrastive learning presents key challenges: learning cross-modal
alignment and managing the high computational cost of large encoders. Prior
approaches address scalability by freezing the text encoder and update only the
image encoder and text projection layer. However, we find this severely limits
semantic alignment and becomes a bottleneck for performance scaling. We propose
CovMatch, a scalable dataset distillation framework that aligns the
cross-covariance of real and synthetic features while regularizing feature
distributions within each modality. Unlike prior approaches, CovMatch enables
joint optimization of both encoders, leading to stronger cross-modal alignment
and improved performance. Evaluated on Flickr30K and COCO, CovMatch outperforms
state-of-the-art multimodal distillation methods and achieves up to 6.8%
absolute gains in retrieval accuracy using only 500 synthetic pairs.

Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型在理解3D空间关系方面存在局限，主要依赖纯文本或2D视觉线索，难以处理需要3D空间想象的任务。

Method: 采用两阶段训练：首先通过监督训练将VLM生成的3D潜在表示与3D基础模型对齐，然后基于结果信号优化整个推理轨迹以精炼3D心理建模。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，3DThinker始终优于强基线方法，为将3D表示统一到多模态推理提供了新视角。

Conclusion: 3DThinker框架首次实现了无需3D先验输入的3D心理建模推理，有效提升了3D空间关系理解能力。

Abstract: Though recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved
remarkable progress across a wide range of multimodal tasks, understanding 3D
spatial relationships from limited views remains a significant challenge.
Previous reasoning methods typically rely on pure text (e.g., topological
cognitive maps) or on 2D visual cues. However, their limited representational
capacity hinders performance in specific tasks that require 3D spatial
imagination. To address this limitation, we propose 3DThinker, a framework that
can effectively exploits the rich geometric information embedded within images
while reasoning, like humans do. Our framework is the first to enable 3D
mentaling during reasoning without any 3D prior input, and it does not rely on
explicitly labeled 3D data for training. Specifically, our training consists of
two stages. First, we perform supervised training to align the 3D latent
generated by VLM while reasoning with that of a 3D foundation model (e.g.,
VGGT). Then, we optimize the entire reasoning trajectory solely based on
outcome signals, thereby refining the underlying 3D mentaling. Extensive
experiments across multiple benchmarks show that 3DThinker consistently
outperforms strong baselines and offers a new perspective toward unifying 3D
representations into multimodal reasoning. Our code will be available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子显微镜生物图像语义分割在生命科学中具有挑战性，数据复杂到人类观察者都难以处理，需要开发在极稀疏标注下仍能有效学习的方法。

Method: 使用分层变分自编码器，结合中心区域掩码、稀疏标签对比学习、高斯混合模型先验和无聚类标签预测，通过修复损失学习鲁棒嵌入表示。

Result: 在2个密集电子显微镜生物组织数据集上，ε-Seg在稀疏监督下实现了竞争性的分割结果，并成功应用于荧光显微镜数据。

Conclusion: ε-Seg能够在有限训练标签的情况下，对复杂生物图像数据实现有效的稀疏监督语义分割。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of electron microscopy (EM) images of biological
samples remains a challenge in the life sciences. EM data captures details of
biological structures, sometimes with such complexity that even human observers
can find it overwhelming. We introduce {\epsilon}-Seg, a method based on
hierarchical variational autoencoders (HVAEs), employing center-region masking,
sparse label contrastive learning (CL), a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) prior,
and clustering-free label prediction. Center-region masking and the inpainting
loss encourage the model to learn robust and representative embeddings to
distinguish the desired classes, even if training labels are sparse (0.05% of
the total image data or less). For optimal performance, we employ CL and a GMM
prior to shape the latent space of the HVAE such that encoded input patches
tend to cluster wrt. the semantic classes we wish to distinguish. Finally,
instead of clustering latent embeddings for semantic segmentation, we propose a
MLP semantic segmentation head to directly predict class labels from latent
embeddings. We show empirical results of {\epsilon}-Seg and baseline methods on
2 dense EM datasets of biological tissues and demonstrate the applicability of
our method also on fluorescence microscopy data. Our results show that
{\epsilon}-Seg is capable of achieving competitive sparsely-supervised
segmentation results on complex biological image data, even if only limited
amounts of training labels are available.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的矩阵量化方法BQQ，使用二元二次表达式替代传统的一阶量化方法，在保持紧凑数据格式的同时提升表达能力。在矩阵压缩和视觉Transformer后训练量化中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的一阶量化方法（如均匀量化和二进制编码量化）通过二进制基的线性组合来近似实值矩阵，表达能力有限。BQQ旨在利用二元二次表达式的强大表达能力，同时保持极紧凑的数据格式。

Method: 提出Binary Quadratic Quantization (BQQ)方法，使用二元二次表达式进行矩阵量化，而不是传统的线性组合方法。该方法不依赖特定的二进制矩阵优化技术。

Result: 在矩阵压缩基准测试中，BQQ在内存效率和重构误差之间实现了优于传统方法的权衡。在后训练量化中，在ImageNet数据集上，在基于校准和无数据场景下分别比最先进方法提升2.2%和59.1%，量化等效为2比特。

Conclusion: 二元二次表达式在高效矩阵近似和神经网络压缩方面具有惊人的有效性，BQQ方法为矩阵量化提供了新的有效途径。

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel matrix quantization method, Binary Quadratic
Quantization (BQQ). In contrast to conventional first-order quantization
approaches, such as uniform quantization and binary coding quantization, that
approximate real-valued matrices via linear combinations of binary bases, BQQ
leverages the expressive power of binary quadratic expressions while
maintaining an extremely compact data format. We validate our approach with two
experiments: a matrix compression benchmark and post-training quantization
(PTQ) on pretrained Vision Transformer-based models. Experimental results
demonstrate that BQQ consistently achieves a superior trade-off between memory
efficiency and reconstruction error than conventional methods for compressing
diverse matrix data. It also delivers strong PTQ performance, even though we
neither target state-of-the-art PTQ accuracy under tight memory constraints nor
rely on PTQ-specific binary matrix optimization. For example, our proposed
method outperforms the state-of-the-art PTQ method by up to 2.2\% and 59.1% on
the ImageNet dataset under the calibration-based and data-free scenarios,
respectively, with quantization equivalent to 2 bits. These findings highlight
the surprising effectiveness of binary quadratic expressions for efficient
matrix approximation and neural network compression.

Motivation: 传统变化检测方法需要大量标注数据，本文旨在通过主动学习减少人工标注成本，通过交互式问答模型动态更新检测模型。

Method: 使用可逆网络将非线性输入空间映射到潜在空间，在潜在空间进行线性数据增强，然后将增强数据映射回输入空间用于重新训练变化检测模型。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法相比相关工作具有更优越的性能表现。

Conclusion: 提出的基于主动学习和可逆网络的交互式变化检测框架能够有效减少标注需求，同时提升检测精度。

Abstract: This paper devises a novel interactive satellite image change detection
algorithm based on active learning. Our framework employs an iterative process
that leverages a question-and-answer model. This model queries the oracle
(user) about the labels of a small subset of images (dubbed as display), and
based on the oracle's responses, change detection model is dynamically updated.
The main contribution of our framework resides in a novel invertible network
that allows augmenting displays, by mapping them from highly nonlinear input
spaces to latent ones, where augmentation transformations become linear and
more tractable. The resulting augmented data are afterwards mapped back to the
input space, and used to retrain more effective change detection criteria in
the subsequent iterations of active learning. Experimental results demonstrate
superior performance of our proposed method compared to the related work.

Motivation: 历史笔迹识别面临手写风格多样性、文档退化、标注样本有限等挑战，传统方法依赖手工特征，端到端方法旨在自动化学习特征但泛化能力不足。

Method: 探索了不同的预处理方法、骨干架构和后处理策略组合，包括文本分割、补丁采样和特征聚合。

Conclusion: 指出了构建稳健端到端系统的关键挑战，并为历史文档笔迹识别的设计选择提供了见解。

Abstract: This paper investigates various factors that influence the performance of
end-to-end deep learning approaches for historical writer identification (HWI),
a task that remains challenging due to the diversity of handwriting styles,
document degradation, and the limited number of labelled samples per writer.
These conditions often make accurate recognition difficult, even for human
experts. Traditional HWI methods typically rely on handcrafted image processing
and clustering techniques, which tend to perform well on small and carefully
curated datasets. In contrast, end-to-end pipelines aim to automate the process
by learning features directly from document images. However, our experiments
show that many of these models struggle to generalise in more realistic,
document-level settings, especially under zero-shot scenarios where writers in
the test set are not present in the training data. We explore different
combinations of pre-processing methods, backbone architectures, and
post-processing strategies, including text segmentation, patch sampling, and
feature aggregation. The results suggest that most configurations perform
poorly due to weak capture of low-level visual features, inconsistent patch
representations, and high sensitivity to content noise. Still, we identify one
end-to-end setup that achieves results comparable to the top-performing system,
despite using a simpler design. These findings point to key challenges in
building robust end-to-end systems and offer insight into design choices that
improve performance in historical document writer identification.

Conclusion: MoGA通过语义感知路由实现了有效的长距离交互，解决了长视频生成的注意力瓶颈，为高效长视频生成提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Long video generation with Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) is bottlenecked by
the quadratic scaling of full attention with sequence length. Since attention
is highly redundant, outputs are dominated by a small subset of query-key
pairs. Existing sparse methods rely on blockwise coarse estimation, whose
accuracy-efficiency trade-offs are constrained by block size. This paper
introduces Mixture-of-Groups Attention (MoGA), an efficient sparse attention
that uses a lightweight, learnable token router to precisely match tokens
without blockwise estimation. Through semantic-aware routing, MoGA enables
effective long-range interactions. As a kernel-free method, MoGA integrates
seamlessly with modern attention stacks, including FlashAttention and sequence
parallelism. Building on MoGA, we develop an efficient long video generation
model that end-to-end produces minute-level, multi-shot, 480p videos at 24 fps,
with a context length of approximately 580k. Comprehensive experiments on
various video generation tasks validate the effectiveness of our approach.

Conclusion: UniGenBench++为文本到图像生成提供了更全面、多语言和细粒度的语义一致性评估基准，有助于推动该领域的发展。

Abstract: Recent progress in text-to-image (T2I) generation underscores the importance
of reliable benchmarks in evaluating how accurately generated images reflect
the semantics of their textual prompt. However, (1) existing benchmarks lack
the diversity of prompt scenarios and multilingual support, both essential for
real-world applicability; (2) they offer only coarse evaluations across primary
dimensions, covering a narrow range of sub-dimensions, and fall short in
fine-grained sub-dimension assessment. To address these limitations, we
introduce UniGenBench++, a unified semantic assessment benchmark for T2I
generation. Specifically, it comprises 600 prompts organized hierarchically to
ensure both coverage and efficiency: (1) spans across diverse real-world
scenarios, i.e., 5 main prompt themes and 20 subthemes; (2) comprehensively
probes T2I models' semantic consistency over 10 primary and 27 sub evaluation
criteria, with each prompt assessing multiple testpoints. To rigorously assess
model robustness to variations in language and prompt length, we provide both
English and Chinese versions of each prompt in short and long forms. Leveraging
the general world knowledge and fine-grained image understanding capabilities
of a closed-source Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM), i.e.,
Gemini-2.5-Pro, an effective pipeline is developed for reliable benchmark
construction and streamlined model assessment. Moreover, to further facilitate
community use, we train a robust evaluation model that enables offline
assessment of T2I model outputs. Through comprehensive benchmarking of both
open- and closed-sourced T2I models, we systematically reveal their strengths
and weaknesses across various aspects.

Motivation: 解决现有对比视觉语言模型在处理复杂网页文档时的局限性，特别是当文本和图像交错、松散对齐或嵌入视觉形式时。

Method: 使用单一视觉变换器在像素空间中建模所有输入，通过渲染文本和图像为图像，采用片段级对比学习目标对齐连续多模态片段。

Result: 在提出的三个检索基准（AnyCIR、SeqCIR、CSR）和现有数据集（M-BEIR、MTEB）上，VC2L实现了与CLIP风格模型相当或更优的性能。

Conclusion: 多模态网页数据是对比学习的有价值训练资源，统一的视觉中心方法在多模态表示学习中具有可扩展性。

Abstract: Contrastive vision-language models such as CLIP have demonstrated strong
performance across a wide range of multimodal tasks by learning from aligned
image-text pairs. However, their ability to handle complex, real-world web
documents remains limited, particularly in scenarios where text and images are
interleaved, loosely aligned, or embedded in visual form. To address these
challenges, we propose Vision-Centric Contrastive Learning (VC2L), a unified
framework that models text, images, and their combinations using a single
vision transformer. VC2L operates entirely in pixel space by rendering all
inputs, whether textual, visual, or combined, as images, thus eliminating the
need for OCR, text tokenization, or modality fusion strategy. To capture
complex cross-modal relationships in multimodal web documents, VC2L employs a
snippet-level contrastive learning objective that aligns consecutive multimodal
segments, leveraging the inherent coherence of documents without requiring
explicitly paired image-text data. To assess the effectiveness of this
approach, we introduce three retrieval benchmarks, AnyCIR, SeqCIR, and CSR,
designed to evaluate cross-modal retrieval, fine-grained sequential
understanding, and generalization to unseen data, respectively. Empirical
results show that VC2L achieves competitive or superior performance compared to
CLIP-style models on both the proposed benchmarks and established datasets such
as M-BEIR and MTEB. These findings underscore the potential of multimodal web
data as a valuable training resource for contrastive learning and illustrate
the scalability of a unified, vision-centric approach for multimodal
representation learning. Code and models are available at:

*Peiqin Zhuang,Lei Bai,Yichao Wu,Ding Liang,Luping Zhou,Yali Wang,Wanli Ouyang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出EMIM模块，将传统动作识别中的cost volume思想融入transformer，通过滑动窗口方式从下一帧采样关键候选token构建亲和矩阵，同时支持外观建模和运动建模，在运动敏感数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于transformer的动作识别方法在场景相关数据集上表现良好，但在运动敏感数据集上表现不佳，因为它们缺乏精细的运动建模设计。而传统动作识别中广泛使用的cost volume具有强大的运动建模能力。

Method: 提出EMIM模块，以cost volume风格构建亲和矩阵，通过滑动窗口方式从下一帧的查询邻域采样关键候选token，构建的亲和矩阵既用于上下文聚合进行外观建模，也转换为运动特征进行运动建模。

Result: 在四个广泛使用的数据集上验证了方法的运动建模能力，特别是在运动敏感数据集Something-Something V1和V2上优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 将cost volume的运动建模特性以统一简洁的方式集成到现有transformer中是有效的，EMIM模块在运动敏感数据集上表现出色。

Abstract: Recently, action recognition has been dominated by transformer-based methods,
thanks to their spatiotemporal contextual aggregation capacities. However,
despite the significant progress achieved on scene-related datasets, they do
not perform well on motion-sensitive datasets due to the lack of elaborate
motion modeling designs. Meanwhile, we observe that the widely-used cost volume
in traditional action recognition is highly similar to the affinity matrix
defined in self-attention, but equipped with powerful motion modeling
capacities. In light of this, we propose to integrate those effective motion
modeling properties into the existing transformer in a unified and neat way,
with the proposal of the Explicit Motion Information Mining module (EMIM). In
EMIM, we propose to construct the desirable affinity matrix in a cost volume
style, where the set of key candidate tokens is sampled from the query-based
neighboring area in the next frame in a sliding-window manner. Then, the
constructed affinity matrix is used to aggregate contextual information for
appearance modeling and is converted into motion features for motion modeling
as well. We validate the motion modeling capacities of our method on four
widely-used datasets, and our method performs better than existing
state-of-the-art approaches, especially on motion-sensitive datasets, i.e.,
Something-Something V1 & V2.

Conclusion: PLANA3R通过平面3D表示实现了无需平面监督的度量3D重建，具有准确的平面分割能力，可扩展应用于大规模立体数据集。

Abstract: This paper addresses metric 3D reconstruction of indoor scenes by exploiting
their inherent geometric regularities with compact representations. Using
planar 3D primitives - a well-suited representation for man-made environments -
we introduce PLANA3R, a pose-free framework for metric Planar 3D Reconstruction
from unposed two-view images. Our approach employs Vision Transformers to
extract a set of sparse planar primitives, estimate relative camera poses, and
supervise geometry learning via planar splatting, where gradients are
propagated through high-resolution rendered depth and normal maps of
primitives. Unlike prior feedforward methods that require 3D plane annotations
during training, PLANA3R learns planar 3D structures without explicit plane
supervision, enabling scalable training on large-scale stereo datasets using
only depth and normal annotations. We validate PLANA3R on multiple indoor-scene
datasets with metric supervision and demonstrate strong generalization to
out-of-domain indoor environments across diverse tasks under metric evaluation
protocols, including 3D surface reconstruction, depth estimation, and relative
pose estimation. Furthermore, by formulating with planar 3D representation, our
method emerges with the ability for accurate plane segmentation. The project

*Siyong Jian,Huan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对自回归图像生成模型的KV缓存压缩框架，通过识别空间局部性和语义汇聚现象，将注意力头分为两类进行自适应压缩，实现了5倍内存减少和6.6倍吞吐量提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归图像生成模型如Janus-Pro虽然能生成高质量图像，但由于大量视觉token导致内存和计算需求巨大。虽然KV缓存压缩在语言建模中已有研究，但在图像生成领域仍未被充分探索。

Method: 识别了空间局部性和语义汇聚的注意力现象，提出将注意力头分为两类：对于空间局部性头，维护短期的最近token窗口；对于语义汇聚头，策略性地保留高度关注的紧凑token集合。

Result: 实验表明该方法实现了5倍内存使用减少和6.6倍整体吞吐量加速，仅带来最小的视觉质量损失。

Conclusion: 该方法能够在资源受限的硬件上实现高效的原生自回归图像生成。

Abstract: Autoregressive image generation models like Janus-Pro produce high-quality
images, but at the significant cost of high memory and ever-growing
computational demands due to the large number of visual tokens. While KV cache
compression has been extensively studied in language modeling, it still remains
largely unexplored for the image generation domain. In this work, we begin by
identifying a distinct and prominent attention phenomenon, which we term
spatial locality and emergent semantic sink. To leverage this key insight, we
introduce a novel KV cache compression framework. Specifically, we compress the
KV cache for all visual tokens by adaptively decoupling attention heads into
two separate types: for spatial-locality heads, our method maintains a short
recent token window; for semantic-sink heads, it strategically preserves a
compact set of highly-attended tokens. Our extensive experiments demonstrate
that the proposed method achieves a 5$\times$ reduction in memory usage and a
notable 6.6$\times$ speedup in overall throughput with only minimal visual
quality loss, thereby enabling highly efficient native autoregressive image
generation on resource-constrained hardware.

TL;DR: 提出了IF-VidCap基准，用于评估可控视频字幕生成，包含1400个高质量样本，从格式正确性和内容正确性两个维度评估字幕质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要评估描述性全面性，而忽视了指令跟随能力，但实际应用需要根据特定用户指令生成字幕。

Method: 引入IF-VidCap基准，采用系统化框架从格式正确性和内容正确性两个维度评估字幕质量。

Result: 评估了20多个知名模型，发现专有模型仍占主导但差距正在缩小，顶级开源解决方案已接近同等水平；专用于密集字幕的模型在复杂指令上表现不如通用MLLMs。

Conclusion: 未来工作应同时推进描述丰富性和指令跟随保真度的发展。

Abstract: Although Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
proficiency in video captioning, practical applications require captions that
follow specific user instructions rather than generating exhaustive,
unconstrained descriptions. Current benchmarks, however, primarily assess
descriptive comprehensiveness while largely overlooking instruction-following
capabilities. To address this gap, we introduce IF-VidCap, a new benchmark for
evaluating controllable video captioning, which contains 1,400 high-quality
samples. Distinct from existing video captioning or general
instruction-following benchmarks, IF-VidCap incorporates a systematic framework
that assesses captions on two dimensions: format correctness and content
correctness. Our comprehensive evaluation of over 20 prominent models reveals a
nuanced landscape: despite the continued dominance of proprietary models, the
performance gap is closing, with top-tier open-source solutions now achieving
near-parity. Furthermore, we find that models specialized for dense captioning
underperform general-purpose MLLMs on complex instructions, indicating that
future work should simultaneously advance both descriptive richness and
instruction-following fidelity.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了ColIAGS，一种针对结肠镜检查优化的3D高斯泼溅框架，通过改进的外观建模和几何建模解决了动态光照下的渲染问题，显著提升了渲染质量和几何重建精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统3D高斯泼溅方法假设静态光照，无法处理结肠镜场景中由动态光源/相机引起的光度变化，导致重建质量下降。现有方法仅考虑光照距离衰减，忽略了光源和相机的物理特性。

Method: 提出改进的外观建模，包含两种光照衰减因子；改进的几何建模使用高维视图嵌入增强高斯几何属性预测；利用余弦嵌入隐式生成光照衰减解决方案。

Result: 在标准基准测试中，ColIAGS实现了新颖视图合成和精确几何重建的双重能力，在渲染保真度方面显著优于现有方法，同时大幅降低了深度MSE。

Conclusion: ColIAGS通过物理准确的光照建模有效解决了结肠镜场景中的动态光照问题，为虚拟结肠镜和病变跟踪等应用提供了高质量的3D重建解决方案。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a pivotal technique for real-time
view synthesis in colonoscopy, enabling critical applications such as virtual
colonoscopy and lesion tracking. However, the vanilla 3DGS assumes static
illumination and that observed appearance depends solely on viewing angle,
which causes incompatibility with the photometric variations in colonoscopic
scenes induced by dynamic light source/camera. This mismatch forces most 3DGS
methods to introduce structure-violating vaporous Gaussian blobs between the
camera and tissues to compensate for illumination attenuation, ultimately
degrading the quality of 3D reconstructions. Previous works only consider the
illumination attenuation caused by light distance, ignoring the physical
characters of light source and camera. In this paper, we propose ColIAGS, an
improved 3DGS framework tailored for colonoscopy. To mimic realistic appearance
under varying illumination, we introduce an Improved Appearance Modeling with
two types of illumination attenuation factors, which enables Gaussians to adapt
to photometric variations while preserving geometry accuracy. To ensure the
geometry approximation condition of appearance modeling, we propose an Improved
Geometry Modeling using high-dimensional view embedding to enhance Gaussian
geometry attribute prediction. Furthermore, another cosine embedding input is
leveraged to generate illumination attenuation solutions in an implicit manner.
Comprehensive experimental results on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our
proposed ColIAGS achieves the dual capabilities of novel view synthesis and
accurate geometric reconstruction. It notably outperforms other
state-of-the-art methods by achieving superior rendering fidelity while
significantly reducing Depth MSE. Code will be available.

Result: 在SSB基准、Oxford-Pet和Herbarium19等细粒度数据集上持续达到SOTA，并在粗粒度数据集上展示良好泛化能力。

Conclusion: SEAL通过利用自然层次结构有效解决了GCD问题，在多个数据集上验证了其优越性能。

Abstract: This paper investigates the problem of Generalized Category Discovery (GCD).
Given a partially labelled dataset, GCD aims to categorize all unlabelled
images, regardless of whether they belong to known or unknown classes. Existing
approaches typically depend on either single-level semantics or manually
designed abstract hierarchies, which limit their generalizability and
scalability. To address these limitations, we introduce a SEmantic-aware
hierArchical Learning framework (SEAL), guided by naturally occurring and
easily accessible hierarchical structures. Within SEAL, we propose a
Hierarchical Semantic-Guided Soft Contrastive Learning approach that exploits
hierarchical similarity to generate informative soft negatives, addressing the
limitations of conventional contrastive losses that treat all negatives
equally. Furthermore, a Cross-Granularity Consistency (CGC) module is designed
to align the predictions from different levels of granularity. SEAL
consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance on fine-grained benchmarks,
including the SSB benchmark, Oxford-Pet, and the Herbarium19 dataset, and
further demonstrates generalization on coarse-grained datasets. Project page:

Motivation: 随着城市化和气候变化加剧，城市热岛效应日益严重。传统机器学习模型在数据有限的情况下预测不准确，特别是在服务不足地区。地理空间基础模型因其强泛化能力和只需少量微调而成为有前景的替代方案。

Method: 建立城市热模式的实证地面实况，量化绿地的冷却效应并与模型预测进行基准测试。随后对基础模型进行微调，预测未来气候情景下的地表温度，并通过模拟修复展示其实用价值。

Conclusion: 地理空间基础模型是评估城市热岛缓解策略的强大方法，特别是在数据稀缺地区，有助于支持更具气候韧性的城市建设。

Abstract: As urbanization and climate change progress, urban heat island effects are
becoming more frequent and severe. To formulate effective mitigation plans,
cities require detailed air temperature data, yet conventional machine learning
models with limited data often produce inaccurate predictions, particularly in
underserved areas. Geospatial foundation models trained on global unstructured
data offer a promising alternative by demonstrating strong generalization and
requiring only minimal fine-tuning. In this study, an empirical ground truth of
urban heat patterns is established by quantifying cooling effects from green
spaces and benchmarking them against model predictions to evaluate the model's
accuracy. The foundation model is subsequently fine-tuned to predict land
surface temperatures under future climate scenarios, and its practical value is
demonstrated through a simulated inpainting that highlights its role for
mitigation support. The results indicate that foundation models offer a
powerful way for evaluating urban heat island mitigation strategies in
data-scarce regions to support more climate-resilient cities.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UltraGen是一个新颖的视频生成框架，通过分层双分支注意力架构实现高效端到端原生高分辨率视频合成，能够将预训练低分辨率视频模型扩展到1080P甚至4K分辨率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于扩散变换器的视频生成模型由于注意力机制的计算复杂度问题，仅限于低分辨率输出（≤720P），无法实现原生高分辨率视频生成（1080P/2K/4K）。

Method: 采用分层双分支注意力架构，基于全局-局部注意力分解，将完整注意力解耦为局部注意力分支（用于高保真区域内容）和全局注意力分支（用于整体语义一致性）；提出空间压缩全局建模策略和分层跨窗口局部注意力机制。

Result: 实验表明UltraGen能够有效将预训练低分辨率视频模型扩展到1080P和4K分辨率，在定性和定量评估中均优于现有最先进方法和基于超分辨率的两阶段流程。

Conclusion: UltraGen框架成功解决了高分辨率视频生成的计算瓶颈问题，首次实现了原生高分辨率视频合成，为视频生成领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in video generation have made it possible to produce visually
compelling videos, with wide-ranging applications in content creation,
entertainment, and virtual reality. However, most existing diffusion
transformer based video generation models are limited to low-resolution outputs
(<=720P) due to the quadratic computational complexity of the attention
mechanism with respect to the output width and height. This computational
bottleneck makes native high-resolution video generation (1080P/2K/4K)
impractical for both training and inference. To address this challenge, we
present UltraGen, a novel video generation framework that enables i) efficient
and ii) end-to-end native high-resolution video synthesis. Specifically,
UltraGen features a hierarchical dual-branch attention architecture based on
global-local attention decomposition, which decouples full attention into a
local attention branch for high-fidelity regional content and a global
attention branch for overall semantic consistency. We further propose a
spatially compressed global modeling strategy to efficiently learn global
dependencies, and a hierarchical cross-window local attention mechanism to
reduce computational costs while enhancing information flow across different
local windows. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UltraGen can effectively
scale pre-trained low-resolution video models to 1080P and even 4K resolution
for the first time, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods and
super-resolution based two-stage pipelines in both qualitative and quantitative
evaluations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有超光谱异常检测方法需要每个场景重新训练或参数调整，效率较低。本文旨在开发一种能够一次训练后普遍部署的高效鲁棒检测方法。

Method: 采用两阶段学习策略：首先通过反向蒸馏训练光谱增强网络获得背景光谱表征；然后使用去相关损失优化空间网络（叛逆学生），强制特征正交性同时保持重建保真度。

Result: 在HAD100基准测试中相比多个基线方法有显著提升，计算开销最小，验证了互补学习范式的有效性和通用性。

Conclusion: 提出的叛逆学生框架成功实现了光谱和空间背景特征的互补增强，支持参数无关和训练无关的异常检测，具有优异的性能和实用性。

Abstract: A recent class of hyperspectral anomaly detection methods that can be trained
once on background datasets and then universally deployed -- without per-scene
retraining or parameter tuning -- has demonstrated remarkable efficiency and
robustness. Building upon this paradigm, we focus on the integration of
spectral and spatial cues and introduce a novel "Rebellious Student" framework
for complementary feature learning. Unlike conventional teacher-student
paradigms driven by imitation, our method intentionally trains the spatial
branch to diverge from the spectral teacher, thereby learning complementary
spatial patterns that the teacher fails to capture. A two-stage learning
strategy is adopted: (1) a spectral enhancement network is first trained via
reverse distillation to obtain robust background spectral representations; and
(2) a spatial network -- the rebellious student -- is subsequently optimized
using decorrelation losses that enforce feature orthogonality while maintaining
reconstruction fidelity to avoid irrelevant noise. Once trained, the framework
enhances both spectral and spatial background features, enabling parameter-free
and training-free anomaly detection when paired with conventional detectors.
Extensive experiments on the HAD100 benchmark show substantial improvements
over several established baselines with minimal computational overhead,
confirming the effectiveness and generality of the proposed complementary
learning paradigm. Our code is publicly available at

TL;DR: ProCLIP是一个基于课程学习的渐进式视觉-语言对齐框架，通过将CLIP图像编码器与基于LLM的嵌入器对齐，解决了CLIP文本编码器在处理长文本、多语言和细粒度语义理解方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 原始CLIP文本编码器存在77个token的最大输入长度限制，无法有效处理长文本和进行细粒度语义理解，且不支持多语言输入。现有方法直接使用LLM替换CLIP文本编码器会破坏CLIP图像编码器的内在视觉-语言对齐。

Method: 采用课程学习策略：1）从CLIP文本编码器向LLM嵌入器蒸馏知识；2）通过图像-文本对比调优进一步对齐CLIP图像编码器与LLM嵌入器，使用自蒸馏正则化防止过拟合；3）在表示继承和对比调优阶段使用实例语义对齐损失和嵌入结构对齐损失。

Result: ProCLIP能够有效对齐CLIP图像编码器与LLM嵌入器，同时保留CLIP预训练的知识，提升了处理长文本、多语言理解和细粒度语义理解的能力。

Conclusion: 提出的渐进式对齐框架成功解决了直接对齐方法破坏CLIP内在视觉-语言对齐的问题，为扩展CLIP在更广泛任务中的应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The original CLIP text encoder is limited by a maximum input length of 77
tokens, which hampers its ability to effectively process long texts and perform
fine-grained semantic understanding. In addition, the CLIP text encoder lacks
support for multilingual inputs. All these limitations significantly restrict
its applicability across a broader range of tasks. Recent studies have
attempted to replace the CLIP text encoder with an LLM-based embedder to
enhance its ability in processing long texts, multilingual understanding, and
fine-grained semantic comprehension. However, because the representation spaces
of LLMs and the vision-language space of CLIP are pretrained independently
without alignment priors, direct alignment using contrastive learning can
disrupt the intrinsic vision-language alignment in the CLIP image encoder,
leading to an underutilization of the knowledge acquired during pre-training.
To address this challenge, we propose ProCLIP, a curriculum learning-based
progressive vision-language alignment framework to effectively align the CLIP
image encoder with an LLM-based embedder. Specifically, ProCLIP first distills
knowledge from CLIP's text encoder into the LLM-based embedder to leverage
CLIP's rich pretrained knowledge while establishing initial alignment between
the LLM embedder and CLIP image encoder. Subsequently, ProCLIP further aligns
the CLIP image encoder with the LLM-based embedder through image-text
contrastive tuning, employing self-distillation regularization to avoid
overfitting. To achieve a more effective alignment, instance semantic alignment
loss and embedding structure alignment loss are employed during representation
inheritance and contrastive tuning. The Code is available at

Motivation: 结核病在资源有限和偏远地区仍是重大健康问题，早期检测对治疗至关重要，但缺乏专业放射科医生，需要AI驱动的筛查工具。开发可靠AI模型因需要大量高质量数据集而具有挑战性。

Method: 采用教师-学生框架，整合两个监督头（用于疾病分类和症状检测）和一个自监督头，通过多任务学习增强模型性能。

Abstract: Tuberculosis remains a critical global health issue, particularly in
resource-limited and remote areas. Early detection is vital for treatment, yet
the lack of skilled radiologists underscores the need for artificial
intelligence (AI)-driven screening tools. Developing reliable AI models is
challenging due to the necessity for large, high-quality datasets, which are
costly to obtain. To tackle this, we propose a teacher--student framework which
enhances both disease and symptom detection on chest X-rays by integrating two
supervised heads and a self-supervised head. Our model achieves an accuracy of
98.85% for distinguishing between COVID-19, tuberculosis, and normal cases, and
a macro-F1 score of 90.09% for multilabel symptom detection, significantly
outperforming baselines. The explainability assessments also show the model
bases its predictions on relevant anatomical features, demonstrating promise
for deployment in clinical screening and triage settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有跟踪器通常针对单一任务设计，依赖定制化模块，导致泛化能力有限且模型冗余。需要统一不同粒度的跟踪任务。

Method: 设计任务特定提示编码各种输入为通用提示嵌入，使用统一解码器输出统一形式；引入任务自适应内存机制统一不同粒度的内存匹配；构建包含三种粒度标注的大规模数据集Tracking-Any-Granularity。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，SAM 2++在不同粒度的跟踪任务上均达到了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: SAM 2++建立了一个统一且鲁棒的跟踪框架，能够处理任意粒度的视频跟踪任务。

Abstract: Video tracking aims at finding the specific target in subsequent frames given
its initial state. Due to the varying granularity of target states across
different tasks, most existing trackers are tailored to a single task and
heavily rely on custom-designed modules within the individual task, which
limits their generalization and leads to redundancy in both model design and
parameters. To unify video tracking tasks, we present SAM 2++, a unified model
towards tracking at any granularity, including masks, boxes, and points. First,
to extend target granularity, we design task-specific prompts to encode various
task inputs into general prompt embeddings, and a unified decoder to unify
diverse task results into a unified form pre-output. Next, to satisfy memory
matching, the core operation of tracking, we introduce a task-adaptive memory
mechanism that unifies memory across different granularities. Finally, we
introduce a customized data engine to support tracking training at any
granularity, producing a large and diverse video tracking dataset with rich
annotations at three granularities, termed Tracking-Any-Granularity, which
represents a comprehensive resource for training and benchmarking on unified
tracking. Comprehensive experiments on multiple benchmarks confirm that SAM 2++
sets a new state of the art across diverse tracking tasks at different
granularities, establishing a unified and robust tracking framework.

Conclusion: 层次化掩码框架为图变换器提供统一建模范式，M3Dphormer通过自适应集成多级交互信息实现了优异的性能表现。

Abstract: Graph Transformers (GTs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for graph
representation learning due to their ability to model diverse node
interactions. However, existing GTs often rely on intricate architectural
designs tailored to specific interactions, limiting their flexibility. To
address this, we propose a unified hierarchical mask framework that reveals an
underlying equivalence between model architecture and attention mask
construction. This framework enables a consistent modeling paradigm by
capturing diverse interactions through carefully designed attention masks.
Theoretical analysis under this framework demonstrates that the probability of
correct classification positively correlates with the receptive field size and
label consistency, leading to a fundamental design principle: an effective
attention mask should ensure both a sufficiently large receptive field and a
high level of label consistency. While no single existing mask satisfies this
principle across all scenarios, our analysis reveals that hierarchical masks
offer complementary strengths, motivating their effective integration. Then, we
introduce M3Dphormer, a Mixture-of-Experts-based Graph Transformer with
Multi-Level Masking and Dual Attention Computation. M3Dphormer incorporates
three theoretically grounded hierarchical masks and employs a bi-level expert
routing mechanism to adaptively integrate multi-level interaction information.
To ensure scalability, we further introduce a dual attention computation scheme
that dynamically switches between dense and sparse modes based on local mask
sparsity. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that
M3Dphormer achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating the effectiveness
of our unified framework and model design.

TL;DR: 提出FedDEAP框架，通过解耦语义和领域特征、双提示设计以及文本视觉表示对齐，在联邦学习中增强CLIP模型在多领域场景下的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习中的领域偏移和标签异构问题限制了聚合全局模型的泛化能力，需要有效方法在多领域联邦设置中微调CLIP模型。

Method: 1) 使用语义和领域转换网络解耦图像特征；2) 设计全局语义提示和局部领域提示的双提示机制；3) 在两种学习转换下对齐文本和视觉表示以保持一致性。

Result: 在四个数据集上的实验证明该方法有效提升了CLIP在联邦图像识别中的跨领域泛化性能。

Conclusion: FedDEAP框架通过特征解耦、双提示设计和表示对齐，成功解决了联邦学习中CLIP模型在多领域场景下的泛化挑战。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables multiple clients to collaboratively train
machine learning models without exposing local data, balancing performance and
privacy. However, domain shift and label heterogeneity across clients often
hinder the generalization of the aggregated global model. Recently, large-scale
vision-language models like CLIP have shown strong zero-shot classification
capabilities, raising the question of how to effectively fine-tune CLIP across
domains in a federated setting. In this work, we propose an adaptive federated
prompt tuning framework, FedDEAP, to enhance CLIP's generalization in
multi-domain scenarios. Our method includes the following three key components:
(1) To mitigate the loss of domain-specific information caused by
label-supervised tuning, we disentangle semantic and domain-specific features
in images by using semantic and domain transformation networks with unbiased
mappings; (2) To preserve domain-specific knowledge during global prompt
aggregation, we introduce a dual-prompt design with a global semantic prompt
and a local domain prompt to balance shared and personalized information; (3)
To maximize the inclusion of semantic and domain information from images in the
generated text features, we align textual and visual representations under the
two learned transformations to preserve semantic and domain consistency.
Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method in enhancing the generalization of CLIP for
federated image recognition across multiple domains.

TL;DR: SeeTok是一种视觉中心化的文本处理方法，将文本渲染为图像，利用预训练多模态大语言模型进行解读，相比传统子词分词方法显著减少计算量并提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LLMs依赖子词分词，对低资源语言过度分割产生无意义长序列，增加计算负担。人类通过视觉识别文字形状和模式来阅读，这种方法更自然有效。

Method: 将文本渲染为图像（视觉文本），利用预训练多模态LLMs的OCR和文本-视觉对齐能力来解读这些图像，避免传统分词过程。

Result: 在三个语言任务中，SeeTok性能达到或超过子词分词器，同时减少4.43倍token数量和70.5%的FLOPs，在跨语言泛化、抗噪性和语言层次性方面表现更优。

Conclusion: SeeTok标志着从符号化分词向人类视觉阅读方式的转变，为构建更自然、认知启发的语言模型迈出重要一步。

Abstract: People see text. Humans read by recognizing words as visual objects,
including their shapes, layouts, and patterns, before connecting them to
meaning, which enables us to handle typos, distorted fonts, and various scripts
effectively. Modern large language models (LLMs), however, rely on subword
tokenization, fragmenting text into pieces from a fixed vocabulary. While
effective for high-resource languages, this approach over-segments low-resource
languages, yielding long, linguistically meaningless sequences and inflating
computation. In this work, we challenge this entrenched paradigm and move
toward a vision-centric alternative. Our method, SeeTok, renders text as images
(visual-text) and leverages pretrained multimodal LLMs to interpret them,
reusing strong OCR and text-vision alignment abilities learned from large-scale
multimodal training. Across three different language tasks, SeeTok matches or
surpasses subword tokenizers while requiring 4.43 times fewer tokens and
reducing FLOPs by 70.5%, with additional gains in cross-lingual generalization,
robustness to typographic noise, and linguistic hierarchy. SeeTok signals a
shift from symbolic tokenization to human-like visual reading, and takes a step
toward more natural and cognitively inspired language models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DP²O-SR是一个用于真实图像超分辨率的框架，通过结合全参考和无参考图像质量评估模型构建混合奖励信号，利用感知多样性进行偏好优化，无需人工标注即可提升生成模型的感知质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然预训练的文本到图像扩散模型能为真实图像超分辨率合成丰富细节，但其随机性导致输出质量不稳定。这种随机性既带来挑战，也提供了更宽的感知质量范围，可被利用来提升性能。

Method: 构建混合奖励信号结合全参考和无参考IQA模型；从同一模型输出构建多个偏好对；提出分层偏好优化，基于组内奖励差距和组间多样性自适应加权训练对。

Result: 在扩散和流式T2I骨干网络上的广泛实验表明，DP²O-SR显著提高了感知质量，并在真实世界基准上表现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该框架成功利用感知多样性优化生成模型，无需人工标注即可提升真实图像超分辨率的性能，模型容量影响最优选择比例，分层优化实现了更高效稳定的学习。

Abstract: Benefiting from pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models, real-world
image super-resolution (Real-ISR) methods can synthesize rich and realistic
details. However, due to the inherent stochasticity of T2I models, different
noise inputs often lead to outputs with varying perceptual quality. Although
this randomness is sometimes seen as a limitation, it also introduces a wider
perceptual quality range, which can be exploited to improve Real-ISR
performance. To this end, we introduce Direct Perceptual Preference
Optimization for Real-ISR (DP$^2$O-SR), a framework that aligns generative
models with perceptual preferences without requiring costly human annotations.
We construct a hybrid reward signal by combining full-reference and
no-reference image quality assessment (IQA) models trained on large-scale human
preference datasets. This reward encourages both structural fidelity and
natural appearance. To better utilize perceptual diversity, we move beyond the
standard best-vs-worst selection and construct multiple preference pairs from
outputs of the same model. Our analysis reveals that the optimal selection
ratio depends on model capacity: smaller models benefit from broader coverage,
while larger models respond better to stronger contrast in supervision.
Furthermore, we propose hierarchical preference optimization, which adaptively
weights training pairs based on intra-group reward gaps and inter-group
diversity, enabling more efficient and stable learning. Extensive experiments
across both diffusion- and flow-based T2I backbones demonstrate that DP$^2$O-SR
significantly improves perceptual quality and generalizes well to real-world
benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型和视觉专家模型在2D任务和静态场景中表现出色，但在理解动态3D场景方面能力有限，需要专门评估动态空间关系推理能力。

Method: 构建DSI-Bench基准，包含九个解耦的观察者和物体运动模式，采用时空对称设计减少偏差，系统评估模型对自身运动和物体运动的推理能力。

Result: 评估14个VLM和专家模型发现关键局限：模型经常混淆观察者和物体运动，存在语义偏见，无法准确推断动态场景中的相对关系。

Conclusion: DSI-Bench为开发具有动态空间智能的通用和专家模型提供了有价值的发现和见解。

Abstract: Reasoning about dynamic spatial relationships is essential, as both observers
and objects often move simultaneously. Although vision-language models (VLMs)
and visual expertise models excel in 2D tasks and static scenarios, their
ability to fully understand dynamic 3D scenarios remains limited. We introduce
Dynamic Spatial Intelligence and propose DSI-Bench, a benchmark with nearly
1,000 dynamic videos and over 1,700 manually annotated questions covering nine
decoupled motion patterns of observers and objects. Spatially and temporally
symmetric designs reduce biases and enable systematic evaluation of models'
reasoning about self-motion and object motion. Our evaluation of 14 VLMs and
expert models reveals key limitations: models often conflate observer and
object motion, exhibit semantic biases, and fail to accurately infer relative
relationships in dynamic scenarios. Our DSI-Bench provides valuable findings
and insights about the future development of general and expertise models with
dynamic spatial intelligence.

Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型在复杂场景的细粒度分析方面表现不佳，区域级模型往往孤立理解给定区域，忽略了关键的全局上下文信息。

Method: 引入GAR模型，采用有效的RoI对齐特征重放技术，支持利用全局上下文进行精确感知，并建模多个提示之间的交互关系。

Result: GAR-1B在DLC-Bench上比DAM-3B高出4.5分，在GAR-Bench-VQA上甚至超过InternVL3-78B。零样本GAR-8B在VideoRefer-BenchQ上优于领域内VideoRefer-7B。

Conclusion: GAR通过结合全局上下文和建模多提示交互，实现了从被动描述到主动对话的范式转变，其强大能力可以轻松迁移到视频领域。

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at holistic
understanding, they struggle in capturing the dense world with complex scenes,
requiring fine-grained analysis of intricate details and object
inter-relationships. Region-level MLLMs have been a promising step. However,
previous attempts are generally optimized to understand given regions in
isolation, neglecting crucial global contexts. To address this, we introduce
Grasp Any Region (GAR) for comprehen- sive region-level visual understanding.
Empowered by an effective RoI-aligned feature replay technique, GAR supports
(1) precise perception by leveraging necessary global contexts, and (2)
modeling interactions between multiple prompts. Together, it then naturally
achieves (3) advanced compositional reasoning to answer specific free-form
questions about any region, shifting the paradigm from passive description to
active dialogue. Moreover, we construct GAR-Bench, which not only provides a
more accurate evaluation of single-region comprehension, but also, more
importantly, measures interactions and complex reasoning across multiple
regions. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that GAR-1B not only maintains
the state-of-the-art captioning capabilities, e.g., outperforming DAM-3B +4.5
on DLC-Bench, but also excels at modeling relationships between multiple
prompts with advanced comprehension capabilities, even surpassing InternVL3-78B
on GAR-Bench-VQA. More importantly, our zero-shot GAR-8B even outperforms
in-domain VideoRefer-7B on VideoRefer-BenchQ, indicating its strong
capabilities can be easily transferred to videos.

Motivation: 探索机器人在高风险场景中通过干扰和阻碍校园枪手来增强安全性的潜力。

Method: 使用虚拟现实研究，150名大学生扮演校园枪手角色，测试不同机器人策略（激进vs被动）和干扰方法（无干扰、中等干扰、高干扰）。

Result: 激进且高干扰的机器人相比无机器人控制组减少了46.6%的受害者数量。

Conclusion: 机器人干预具有增强安全的潜力，但在校园环境中使用引发了紧迫的伦理问题。

Abstract: We advance the understanding of robotic intervention in high-risk scenarios
by examining their potential to distract and impede a school shooter. To
evaluate this concept, we conducted a virtual reality study with 150 university
participants role-playing as a school shooter. Within the simulation, an
autonomous robot predicted the shooter's movements and positioned itself
strategically to interfere and distract. The strategy the robot used to
approach the shooter was manipulated -- either moving directly in front of the
shooter (aggressive) or maintaining distance (passive) -- and the distraction
method, ranging from no additional cues (low), to siren and lights (medium), to
siren, lights, and smoke to impair visibility (high). An aggressive,
high-distraction robot reduced the number of victims by 46.6% relative to a
no-robot control. This outcome underscores both the potential of robotic
intervention to enhance safety and the pressing ethical questions surrounding
their use in school environments.

Abstract: We present a reinforcement learning framework for autonomous goalkeeping with
humanoid robots in real-world scenarios. While prior work has demonstrated
similar capabilities on quadrupedal platforms, humanoid goalkeeping introduces
two critical challenges: (1) generating natural, human-like whole-body motions,
and (2) covering a wider guarding range with an equivalent response time.
Unlike existing approaches that rely on separate teleoperation or fixed motion
tracking for whole-body control, our method learns a single end-to-end RL
policy, enabling fully autonomous, highly dynamic, and human-like robot-object
interactions. To achieve this, we integrate multiple human motion priors
conditioned on perceptual inputs into the RL training via an adversarial
scheme. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through real-world
experiments, where the humanoid robot successfully performs agile, autonomous,
and naturalistic interceptions of fast-moving balls. In addition to
goalkeeping, we demonstrate the generalization of our approach through tasks
such as ball escaping and grabbing. Our work presents a practical and scalable
solution for enabling highly dynamic interactions between robots and moving
objects, advancing the field toward more adaptive and lifelike robotic
behaviors.

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of multi-robot navigation where robots
maneuver on a desired \(m\)-dimensional (i.e., \(m\)-D) manifold in the
$n$-dimensional Euclidean space, and maintain a {\it flexible spatial
ordering}. We consider $ m\geq 2$, and the multi-robot coordination is achieved
via non-Euclidean metrics. However, since the $m$-D manifold can be
characterized by the zero-level sets of $n$ implicit functions, the last $m$
entries of the GVF propagation term become {\it strongly coupled} with the
partial derivatives of these functions if the auxiliary vectors are not
appropriately chosen. These couplings not only influence the on-manifold
maneuvering of robots, but also pose significant challenges to the further
design of the ordering-flexible coordination via non-Euclidean metrics.
  To tackle this issue, we first identify a feasible solution of auxiliary
vectors such that the last $m$ entries of the propagation term are effectively
decoupled to be the same constant. Then, we redesign the coordinated GVF (CGVF)
algorithm to {\it boost} the advantages of singularities elimination and global
convergence by treating $m$ manifold parameters as additional $m$ virtual
coordinates. Furthermore, we enable the on-manifold ordering-flexible motion
coordination by allowing each robot to share $m$ virtual coordinates with its
time-varying neighbors and a virtual target robot, which {\it circumvents} the
possible complex calculation if Euclidean metrics were used instead. Finally,
we showcase the proposed algorithm's flexibility, adaptability, and robustness
through extensive simulations with different initial positions,
higher-dimensional manifolds, and robot breakdown, respectively.

Abstract: Imitation Learning (IL) is a natural way for humans to teach robots,
particularly when high-quality demonstrations are easy to obtain. While IL has
been widely applied to single-robot settings, relatively few studies have
addressed the extension of these methods to multi-agent systems, especially in
settings where a single human must provide demonstrations to a team of
collaborating robots. In this paper, we introduce and study Round-Robin
Behavior Cloning (R2BC), a method that enables a single human operator to
effectively train multi-robot systems through sequential, single-agent
demonstrations. Our approach allows the human to teleoperate one agent at a
time and incrementally teach multi-agent behavior to the entire system, without
requiring demonstrations in the joint multi-agent action space. We show that
R2BC methods match, and in some cases surpass, the performance of an oracle
behavior cloning approach trained on privileged synchronized demonstrations
across four multi-agent simulated tasks. Finally, we deploy R2BC on two
physical robot tasks trained using real human demonstrations.

Abstract: Fruit harvesting remains predominantly a labor-intensive process, motivating
the development of research for robotic grippers. Conventional rigid or
vacuum-driven grippers require complex mechanical design or high energy
consumption. Current enveloping-based fruit harvesting grippers lack
adaptability to fruits of different sizes. This paper introduces a
drawstring-inspired, cable-driven soft gripper for versatile and gentle fruit
harvesting. The design employs 3D-printed Thermoplastic Polyurethane (TPU)
pockets with integrated steel wires that constrict around the fruit when
actuated, distributing pressure uniformly to minimize bruising and allow
versatility to fruits of varying sizes. The lightweight structure, which
requires few components, reduces mechanical complexity and cost compared to
other grippers. Actuation is achieved through servo-driven cable control, while
motor feedback provides autonomous grip adjustment with tunable grip strength.
Experimental validation shows that, for tomatoes within the gripper's effective
size range, harvesting was achieved with a 0% immediate damage rate and a
bruising rate of less than 9% after five days, reinforcing the gripper's
suitability for fruit harvesting.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the utility of datasets and whether more data
or the 'right' data is advantageous for robot learning. In particular, we are
interested on quantifying the utility of contact-based data as contact holds
significant information for robot learning. Our approach derives a
contact-aware objective function for learning object dynamics and shape from
pose and contact data. We show that the contact-aware Fisher-information metric
can be used to rank and curate contact-data based on how informative data is
for learning. In addition, we find that selecting a reduced dataset based on
this ranking improves the learning task while also making learning a
deterministic process. Interestingly, our results show that more data is not
necessarily advantageous, and rather, less but informative data can accelerate
learning, especially depending on the contact interactions. Last, we show how
our metric can be used to provide initial guidance on data curation for
contact-based robot learning.

Abstract: Imitation learning from large-scale, diverse human demonstrations has proven
effective for training robots, but collecting such data is costly and
time-consuming. This challenge is amplified for multi-step bimanual mobile
manipulation, where humans must teleoperate both a mobile base and two
high-degree-of-freedom arms. Prior automated data generation frameworks have
addressed static bimanual manipulation by augmenting a few human demonstrations
in simulation, but they fall short for mobile settings due to two key
challenges: (1) determining base placement to ensure reachability, and (2)
positioning the camera to provide sufficient visibility for visuomotor
policies. To address these issues, we introduce MoMaGen, which formulates data
generation as a constrained optimization problem that enforces hard constraints
(e.g., reachability) while balancing soft constraints (e.g., visibility during
navigation). This formulation generalizes prior approaches and provides a
principled foundation for future methods. We evaluate MoMaGen on four
multi-step bimanual mobile manipulation tasks and show that it generates
significantly more diverse datasets than existing methods. Leveraging this
diversity, MoMaGen can train successful imitation learning policies from a
single source demonstration, and these policies can be fine-tuned with as few
as 40 real-world demonstrations to achieve deployment on physical robotic
hardware. More details are available at our project page: momagen.github.io.

*Wenhui Huang,Changhe Chen,Han Qi,Chen Lv,Yilun Du,Heng Yang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: MoTVLA是一个基于混合Transformer的视觉-语言-动作模型，通过快速-慢速统一推理与行为策略学习相结合，解决了现有方法在语言可控性和推理延迟方面的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉-语言指令集成方法面临两个挑战：不使用生成推理作为条件时语言可控性有限，或引入推理时推理延迟显著。需要一种既能保持预训练VLM通用智能，又能提高策略执行效率的方法。

Method: MoTVLA采用混合Transformer架构，包含通用专家（预训练VLM）和领域专家（共享知识的第二个Transformer）。通用专家负责感知、场景理解和语义规划，领域专家生成领域特定的快速推理（如机器人运动分解），动作专家基于分解的运动指令学习多样化行为。

Result: 在自然语言处理基准、机器人仿真环境和真实世界实验中的广泛评估证实，MoTVLA在快速-慢速推理和操作任务性能方面均表现出优越性。

Conclusion: MoTVLA通过集成快速-慢速统一推理与行为策略学习，显著提高了语言可控性和策略执行效率，为机器人学习中的开放世界泛化提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Integrating visual-language instructions into visuomotor policies is gaining
momentum in robot learning for enhancing open-world generalization. Despite
promising advances, existing approaches face two challenges: limited language
steerability when no generated reasoning is used as a condition, or significant
inference latency when reasoning is incorporated.In this work, we introduce
MoTVLA, a mixture-of-transformers (MoT)-based vision-language-action (VLA)
model that integrates fast-slow unified reasoning with behavior policy
learning. MoTVLA preserves the general intelligence of pre-trained VLMs
(serving as the generalist) for tasks such as perception, scene understanding,
and semantic planning, while incorporating a domain expert, a second
transformer that shares knowledge with the pretrained VLM, to generate
domain-specific fast reasoning (e.g., robot motion decomposition), thereby
improving policy execution efficiency. By conditioning the action expert on
decomposed motion instructions, MoTVLA can learn diverse behaviors and
substantially improve language steerability. Extensive evaluations across
natural language processing benchmarks, robotic simulation environments, and
real-world experiments confirm the superiority of MoTVLA in both fast-slow
reasoning and manipulation task performance.

*Muhammad Hanif,Reiji Terunuma,Takumi Sumino,Kelvin Cheng,Takeshi Hatanaka*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Coverage-Recon是一种用于多无人机协同3D地图重建的新算法，通过集成在线地图反馈来实时提高重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实现高质量3D重建需要从不同视角捕获场景关键点图像，而覆盖控制为此提供了有效框架。实时3D重建算法的进步使得能够在飞行过程中渲染演化地图，为无人机运动提供即时反馈。

Method: 使用基于二次规划的角感知覆盖控制器协调无人机运动，确保多视角图像采集并强制执行安全约束。捕获的图像通过NeuralRecon算法实时处理生成演化3D网格。网格变化被解释为重建不确定性的指标，并作为反馈来更新覆盖控制的重要性指数。

Result: 通过仿真和实验验证了Coverage-Recon的有效性，定性和定量结果表明，与传统方法相比，集成在线地图反馈能够产生更完整和准确的3D重建。

Conclusion: Coverage-Recon算法通过集成在线地图反馈，显著提高了多无人机协同3D地图重建的质量和完整性。

Abstract: This article addresses collaborative 3D map reconstruction using multiple
drones. Achieving high-quality reconstruction requires capturing images of
keypoints within the target scene from diverse viewing angles, and coverage
control offers an effective framework to meet this requirement. Meanwhile,
recent advances in real-time 3D reconstruction algorithms make it possible to
render an evolving map during flight, enabling immediate feedback to guide
drone motion. Building on this, we present Coverage-Recon, a novel coordinated
image sampling algorithm that integrates online map feedback to improve
reconstruction quality on-the-fly. In Coverage-Recon, the coordinated motion of
drones is governed by a Quadratic Programming (QP)-based angle-aware coverage
controller, which ensures multi-viewpoint image capture while enforcing safety
constraints. The captured images are processed in real time by the NeuralRecon
algorithm to generate an evolving 3D mesh. Mesh changes across the scene are
interpreted as indicators of reconstruction uncertainty and serve as feedback
to update the importance index of the coverage control as the map evolves. The
effectiveness of Coverage-Recon is validated through simulation and
experiments, demonstrating both qualitatively and quantitatively that
incorporating online map feedback yields more complete and accurate 3D
reconstructions than conventional methods. Project page:

*Alexandros Ntagkas,Chairi Kiourt,Konstantinos Chatzilygeroudis*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: PGTT是一种感知感知的深度强化学习方法，通过奖励塑造而非动作先验来强制执行步态结构，在关节空间中直接操作，支持形态无关的部署，在复杂地形上实现了更高的鲁棒性和更快的收敛速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有感知强化学习方法的两大局限：(i) 使用振荡器或逆运动学步态先验会约束动作空间、增加策略优化偏差并降低跨机器人形态的适应性；(ii) 盲操作难以预测后腿地形且对噪声敏感。

Method: 提出相位引导地形穿越(PGTT)，通过奖励塑造而非动作先验来强制执行步态结构，使用三次Hermite样条编码每条腿的相位，根据局部高度图统计自适应调整摆动高度，并添加摆动相位接触惩罚，策略直接在关节空间中操作。

Result: 在MuJoCo(MJX)中训练，在程序生成的楼梯状地形上，PGTT在推力干扰下成功率最高(中位数+7.5%)，在离散障碍物上成功率+9%，速度跟踪性能相当，收敛速度比强端到端基线快约2倍。在Unitree Go2和ANYmal-C上验证有效。

Conclusion: 地形自适应、相位引导的奖励塑造是一种简单通用的机制，可在不同平台上实现鲁棒的感知运动。

Abstract: State-of-the-art perceptive Reinforcement Learning controllers for legged
robots either (i) impose oscillator or IK-based gait priors that constrain the
action space, add bias to the policy optimization and reduce adaptability
across robot morphologies, or (ii) operate "blind", which struggle to
anticipate hind-leg terrain, and are brittle to noise. In this paper, we
propose Phase-Guided Terrain Traversal (PGTT), a perception-aware deep-RL
approach that overcomes these limitations by enforcing gait structure purely
through reward shaping, thereby reducing inductive bias in policy learning
compared to oscillator/IK-conditioned action priors. PGTT encodes per-leg phase
as a cubic Hermite spline that adapts swing height to local heightmap
statistics and adds a swing-phase contact penalty, while the policy acts
directly in joint space supporting morphology-agnostic deployment. Trained in
MuJoCo (MJX) on procedurally generated stair-like terrains with curriculum and
domain randomization, PGTT achieves the highest success under push disturbances
(median +7.5% vs. the next best method) and on discrete obstacles (+9%), with
comparable velocity tracking, and converging to an effective policy roughly 2x
faster than strong end-to-end baselines. We validate PGTT on a Unitree Go2
using a real-time LiDAR elevation-to-heightmap pipeline, and we report
preliminary results on ANYmal-C obtained with the same hyperparameters. These
findings indicate that terrain-adaptive, phase-guided reward shaping is a
simple and general mechanism for robust perceptive locomotion across platforms.

TL;DR: 提出了MMRHP平台，将小型化硬件在环测试从功能演示提升到严谨的定量分析，通过三阶段测试流程和统一时空测量核心，实现了自动驾驶系统的可重复、可解释的闭环评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有小型化硬件在环平台缺乏系统性的定量分析框架，限制了其作为科学评估工具的价值，需要解决测试保真度、成本和可扩展性之间的平衡问题。

Method: 提出了面向SOTIF标准的三阶段测试流程，设计并实现了以统一时空测量核心为中心的硬件在环平台，确保物理运动和系统时序的一致可追溯量化。

Result: 平台验证显示空间精度达到10.27毫米RMSE，闭环延迟基线约为45毫秒。Autoware案例研究识别出在40毫秒注入延迟时的关键性能悬崖。

Conclusion: 结构化流程与提供统一时空基准的平台相结合，能够实现自动驾驶系统的可重复、可解释和定量闭环评估。

Abstract: Validation of autonomous driving systems requires a trade-off between test
fidelity, cost, and scalability. While miniaturized hardware-in-the-loop (HIL)
platforms have emerged as a promising solution, a systematic framework
supporting rigorous quantitative analysis is generally lacking, limiting their
value as scientific evaluation tools. To address this challenge, we propose
MMRHP, a miniature mixed-reality HIL platform that elevates miniaturized
testing from functional demonstration to rigorous, reproducible quantitative
analysis. The core contributions are threefold. First, we propose a systematic
three-phase testing process oriented toward the Safety of the Intended
Functionality(SOTIF)standard, providing actionable guidance for identifying the
performance limits and triggering conditions of otherwise correctly functioning
systems. Second, we design and implement a HIL platform centered around a
unified spatiotemporal measurement core to support this process, ensuring
consistent and traceable quantification of physical motion and system timing.
Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of this solution through
comprehensive experiments. The platform itself was first validated, achieving a
spatial accuracy of 10.27 mm RMSE and a stable closed-loop latency baseline of
approximately 45 ms. Subsequently, an in-depth Autoware case study leveraged
this validated platform to quantify its performance baseline and identify a
critical performance cliff at an injected latency of 40 ms. This work shows
that a structured process, combined with a platform offering a unified
spatio-temporal benchmark, enables reproducible, interpretable, and
quantitative closed-loop evaluation of autonomous driving systems.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出基于标准2D摄像头的实时工业动作识别框架，使用生物力学先验（关节角度）替代传统关节中心位置，通过时间平滑的Transformer网络实现实时动作识别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法大多依赖关节中心位置且为离线处理，缺乏对传感器位置、人体姿态和个体差异的鲁棒性，需要开发实时且鲁棒的工业动作识别系统。

Method: 构建完整管道：首先估计人体关节运动学，然后输入到时间平滑的Transformer网络进行动作识别，使用关节角度作为特征以提高鲁棒性。

Result: 在包含11名受试者的新数据集上评估，准确率达到88%，优于最佳基线模型，且对不面向摄像头的受试者具有良好泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法在实时性、鲁棒性和泛化性方面表现优异，通过在线交互实验验证了其在实际工业应用中的有效性。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for real-time human action recognition
in industrial contexts, using standard 2D cameras. We introduce a complete
pipeline for robust and real-time estimation of human joint kinematics, input
to a temporally smoothed Transformer-based network, for action recognition. We
rely on a new dataset including 11 subjects performing various actions, to
evaluate our approach. Unlike most of the literature that relies on joint
center positions (JCP) and is offline, ours uses biomechanical prior, eg. joint
angles, for fast and robust real-time recognition. Besides, joint angles make
the proposed method agnostic to sensor and subject poses as well as to
anthropometric differences, and ensure robustness across environments and
subjects. Our proposed learning model outperforms the best baseline model,
running also in real-time, along various metrics. It achieves 88% accuracy and
shows great generalization ability, for subjects not facing the cameras.
Finally, we demonstrate the robustness and usefulness of our technique, through
an online interaction experiment, with a simulated robot controlled in
real-time via the recognized actions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MPC方法大多假设系统是完整的且约束是凸的，但在自主移动机器人运动规划应用中，系统通常是非完整的且约束是非凸的，缺乏理论保证

Method: 设计新颖的MPC公式，针对非完整系统和非凸约束，能够验证在相关实际场景中的可行性

Result: 提出的MPC方法能够保证收敛到期望目标，解决了现有方法在非完整系统和非凸约束下缺乏理论保证的问题

Conclusion: 该方法填补了输出跟踪MPC在非完整系统和非凸约束下的理论空白，为自主移动机器人运动规划提供了可靠的理论基础

Abstract: Motivated by the application of using model predictive control (MPC) for
motion planning of autonomous mobile robots, a form of output tracking MPC for
non-holonomic systems and with non-convex constraints is studied. Although the
advantages of using MPC for motion planning have been demonstrated in several
papers, in most of the available fundamental literature on output tracking MPC
it is assumed, often implicitly, that the model is holonomic and generally the
state or output constraints must be convex. Thus, in application-oriented
publications, empirical results dominate and the topic of proving completeness,
in particular under which assumptions the target is always reached, has
received comparatively little attention. To address this gap, we present a
novel MPC formulation that guarantees convergence to the desired target under
realistic assumptions, which can be verified in relevant real-world scenarios.

Motivation: 解决传统模拟到现实方法依赖大量离线模拟和模型无关策略优化的局限性，减少模拟数据偏差影响，实现直接在真实世界数据上训练

Method: 从实时交互数据构建动力学模型，基于学习到的动力学模型指导策略更新，采用在线学习分析推导次线性遗憾边界

Result: 在液压挖掘机臂和软机器人臂上实验，相比模型无关方法表现出强样本效率，数小时内达到可比性能，对动态变化具有鲁棒适应性

Conclusion: 该方法为挑战性控制任务的高效可靠机器人学习开辟了新途径

Abstract: We present an online model-based reinforcement learning algorithm suitable
for controlling complex robotic systems directly in the real world. Unlike
prevailing sim-to-real pipelines that rely on extensive offline simulation and
model-free policy optimization, our method builds a dynamics model from
real-time interaction data and performs policy updates guided by the learned
dynamics model. This efficient model-based reinforcement learning scheme
significantly reduces the number of samples to train control policies, enabling
direct training on real-world rollout data. This significantly reduces the
influence of bias in the simulated data, and facilitates the search for
high-performance control policies. We adopt online learning analysis to derive
sublinear regret bounds under standard stochastic online optimization
assumptions, providing formal guarantees on performance improvement as more
interaction data are collected. Experimental evaluations were performed on a
hydraulic excavator arm and a soft robot arm, where the algorithm demonstrates
strong sample efficiency compared to model-free reinforcement learning methods,
reaching comparable performance within hours. Robust adaptation to shifting
dynamics was also observed when the payload condition was randomized. Our
approach paves the way toward efficient and reliable on-robot learning for a
broad class of challenging control tasks.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: EfficientNav是一个用于设备端高效零样本物体导航的系统，通过语义感知内存检索和离散内存缓存技术，在小型LLM上实现了比GPT-4基准更高的成功率和显著降低的延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于大型语言模型的物体导航代理严重依赖云端巨型LLM，而直接切换到小型LLM会因模型容量有限导致成功率显著下降，且导航地图的长提示会导致设备端规划延迟高，阻碍在本地设备上部署。

Method: 提出语义感知内存检索来修剪导航地图中的冗余信息，帮助小型LLM更好地理解环境；采用离散内存缓存和基于注意力的内存聚类来高效保存和重用KV缓存以减少规划延迟。

Result: 在HM3D基准测试中，EfficientNav相比基于GPT-4的基线实现了11.1%的成功率提升，并展示了6.7倍的实时延迟降低和4.7倍的端到端延迟降低。

Conclusion: EfficientNav成功实现了在设备端使用小型LLM进行高效零样本物体导航，在成功率和延迟方面均优于基于GPT-4的方法。

Abstract: Object-goal navigation (ObjNav) tasks an agent with navigating to the
location of a specific object in an unseen environment. Embodied agents
equipped with large language models (LLMs) and online constructed navigation
maps can perform ObjNav in a zero-shot manner. However, existing agents heavily
rely on giant LLMs on the cloud, e.g., GPT-4, while directly switching to small
LLMs, e.g., LLaMA3.2-11b, suffer from significant success rate drops due to
limited model capacity for understanding complex navigation maps, which
prevents deploying ObjNav on local devices. At the same time, the long prompt
introduced by the navigation map description will cause high planning latency
on local devices. In this paper, we propose EfficientNav to enable on-device
efficient LLM-based zero-shot ObjNav. To help the smaller LLMs better
understand the environment, we propose semantics-aware memory retrieval to
prune redundant information in navigation maps. To reduce planning latency, we
propose discrete memory caching and attention-based memory clustering to
efficiently save and re-use the KV cache. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate that EfficientNav achieves 11.1% improvement in success rate on
HM3D benchmark over GPT-4-based baselines, and demonstrates 6.7x real-time
latency reduction and 4.7x end-to-end latency reduction over GPT-4 planner. Our
code will be released soon.

integration offers advantages including decoupled position and attitude
control, high structural reuse, and strong adaptability strong adaptability for
grasping and perching. A dynamics model of Flexbee has been developed, and the
nonlinear coupling issue of the moment has been resolved through linearization
of the equivalent moment model. A hierarchical control strategy was used to
design controllers for the two operational modes of Flexbee. Finally, flight,
grasping, and perching experiments were conducted to validate Flexbee's
kinematic capabilities and the effectiveness of the control strategy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CBF方法在处理复杂形状不安全区域时往往需要保守近似，这可能导致过度限制控制动作。本文旨在解决保守约束问题，在保证安全的同时最大化控制自由度。

Method: 同时优化CBF和控制动作，而不是先选择CBF再选择安全控制。提供了CBF族的平滑参数化方法，并在具有加速度约束的双积分器动态系统中验证。

Result: 提出的最小限制超平面CBF方法能够在保证安全性的同时，更接近期望的控制动作，有效减少了保守约束带来的限制。

Conclusion: 通过联合优化CBF和控制动作，可以在不牺牲安全性的前提下获得更灵活的控制策略，特别适用于复杂形状障碍物环境。

Abstract: Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) can provide provable safety guarantees for
dynamic systems. However, finding a valid CBF for a system of interest is often
non-trivial, especially if the shape of the unsafe region is complex and the
CBFs are of higher order. A common solution to this problem is to make a
conservative approximation of the unsafe region in the form of a
line/hyperplane, and use the corresponding conservative Hyperplane-CBF when
deciding on safe control actions. In this letter, we note that conservative
constraints are only a problem if they prevent us from doing what we want.
Thus, instead of first choosing a CBF and then choosing a safe control with
respect to the CBF, we optimize over a combination of CBFs and safe controls to
get as close as possible to our desired control, while still having the safety
guarantee provided by the CBF. We call the corresponding CBF the least
restrictive Hyperplane-CBF. Finally, we also provide a way of creating a smooth
parameterization of the CBF-family for the optimization, and illustrate the
approach on a double integrator dynamical system with acceleration constraints,
moving through a group of arbitrarily shaped static and moving obstacles.

Abstract: Legged rovers provide enhanced mobility compared to wheeled platforms,
enabling navigation on steep and irregular planetary terrains. However,
traditional legged locomotion might be energetically inefficient and
potentially dangerous to the rover on loose and inclined surfaces, such as
crater walls and cave slopes. This paper introduces a preliminary study that
compares the Cost of Transport (CoT) of walking and torso-based sliding
locomotion for quadruped robots across different slopes, friction conditions
and speed levels. By identifying intersections between walking and sliding CoT
curves, we aim to define threshold conditions that may trigger transitions
between the two strategies. The methodology combines physics-based simulations
in Isaac Sim with particle interaction validation in ANSYS-Rocky. Our results
represent an initial step towards adaptive locomotion strategies for planetary
legged rovers.

Abstract: A fundamental aspect for building intelligent autonomous robots that can
assist humans in their daily lives is the construction of rich environmental
representations. While advances in semantic scene representations have enriched
robotic scene understanding, current approaches lack a connection between
spatial features and dynamic events; e.g., connecting the blue mug to the event
washing a mug. In this work, we introduce the event-grounding graph (EGG), a
framework grounding event interactions to spatial features of a scene. This
representation allows robots to perceive, reason, and respond to complex
spatio-temporal queries. Experiments using real robotic data demonstrate EGG's
capability to retrieve relevant information and respond accurately to human
inquiries concerning the environment and events within. Furthermore, the EGG
framework's source code and evaluation dataset are released as open-source at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自主货物运输中，多机器人团队比单个大型机器人更具操作灵活性，需要精确的车辆间距离和路径跟踪精度。

Method: 基于激光雷达教学重复的精确路径跟踪，开发分布式模型预测控制器，使用共享地图进行机器人相对定位。

Result: 分布式MPC与集中式MPC性能相当，在紧密距离场景下直接测量方法表现更好，但长距离偏移时效果不佳。在超过10公里驾驶测试中，能保持最大间距在目标20厘米内。

Conclusion: 分布式计算方法提供的操作灵活性使其非常适合实际部署，能够在各种条件下实现实时地图级车队控制。

Abstract: For autonomous cargo transportation, teams of mobile robots can provide more
operational flexibility than a single large robot. In these scenarios,
precision in both inter-vehicle distance and path tracking is key. With this
motivation, we develop a distributed model-predictive controller (MPC) for
multi-vehicle cargo operations that builds on the precise path-tracking of
lidar teach and repeat. To carry cargo, a following vehicle must maintain a
Euclidean distance offset from a lead vehicle regardless of the path curvature.
Our approach uses a shared map to localize the robots relative to each other
without GNSS or direct observations. We compare our approach to a centralized
MPC and a baseline approach that directly measures the inter-vehicle distance.
The distributed MPC shows equivalent nominal performance to the more complex
centralized MPC. Using a direct measurement of the relative distance between
the leader and follower shows improved tracking performance in close-range
scenarios but struggles with long-range offsets. The operational flexibility
provided by distributing the computation makes it well suited for real
deployments. We evaluate four types of convoyed path trackers with over 10 km
of driving in a coupled convoy. With convoys of two and three rovers, the
proposed distributed MPC method works in real-time to allow map-based convoying
to maintain maximum spacing within 20 cm of the target in various conditions.

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于四足机器人的在线语义对象映射系统，能够在真实室内环境中将传感器检测转换为全局地图中的命名对象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个能够在真实室内环境中持续构建和维护语义对象地图的系统，使机器人能够理解和查询环境中的对象信息。

Method: 集成距离几何与相机检测，在帧内合并共位检测，并在帧间将重复检测关联到持久对象实例。对象在离开视野时仍保留在地图中，重复观测更新同一实例而非创建重复项。

Result: 系统输出一个紧凑的对象层，可查询类别、姿态和置信度，与占据地图集成且可供规划器读取。在机器人测试中，该层在不同视角变化下保持稳定。

Conclusion: 该系统成功实现了在真实室内环境中构建和维护稳定的语义对象地图，为机器人导航和任务规划提供了有效的环境理解能力。

Abstract: We present an online semantic object mapping system for a quadruped robot
operating in real indoor environments, turning sensor detections into named
objects in a global map. During a run, the mapper integrates range geometry
with camera detections, merges co-located detections within a frame, and
associates repeated detections into persistent object instances across frames.
Objects remain in the map when they are out of view, and repeated sightings
update the same instance rather than creating duplicates. The output is a
compact object layer that can be queried (class, pose, and confidence), is
integrated with the occupancy map and readable by a planner. In on-robot tests,
the layer remained stable across viewpoint changes.

TL;DR: MADR框架通过结合MPC指导的对抗性深度学习方法，解决了高维Hamilton-Jacobi可达性分析的计算难题，能够鲁棒地逼近两人零和微分博弈的价值函数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统HJ可达性分析面临维度灾难问题，而物理信息深度学习虽然能克服计算不可行性，但存在收敛慢、精度低的问题，特别是在复杂博弈场景中。

Method: 提出MADR框架，将MPC指导与对抗性深度学习方法结合，通过丰富自监督过程的正则监督来加速收敛和提高解的质量。

Result: 在多种高维仿真和真实机器人代理上测试，MADR显著优于现有最优基线方法，并在硬件实验中取得令人印象深刻的结果。

Conclusion: MADR为两人零和微分博弈提供了一种有效的价值函数逼近方法，能够生成双方最优策略和最坏情况下的鲁棒安全策略。

Abstract: Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) Reachability offers a framework for generating safe
value functions and policies in the face of adversarial disturbance, but is
limited by the curse of dimensionality. Physics-informed deep learning is able
to overcome this infeasibility, but itself suffers from slow and inaccurate
convergence, primarily due to weak PDE gradients and the complexity of
self-supervised learning. A few works, recently, have demonstrated that
enriching the self-supervision process with regular supervision (based on the
nature of the optimal control problem), greatly accelerates convergence and
solution quality, however, these have been limited to single player problems
and simple games. In this work, we introduce MADR: MPC-guided Adversarial
DeepReach, a general framework to robustly approximate the two-player, zero-sum
differential game value function. In doing so, MADR yields the corresponding
optimal strategies for both players in zero-sum games as well as safe policies
for worst-case robustness. We test MADR on a multitude of high-dimensional
simulated and real robotic agents with varying dynamics and games, finding that
our approach significantly out-performs state-of-the-art baselines in
simulation and produces impressive results in hardware.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要关注执行成功率，对高级推理能力的评估维度不完整且任务真实性有限，无法全面评估机器人的认知能力。

Method: 构建RoboBench基准，定义5个评估维度（指令理解、感知推理、泛化规划、功能预测、失败分析），使用来自大规模真实机器人数据的数据集，并引入MLLM-as-world-simulator框架评估规划可行性。

Result: 对14个MLLM的实验揭示了基本局限性：在隐式指令理解、时空推理、跨场景规划、细粒度功能理解和执行失败诊断方面存在困难。

Conclusion: RoboBench为量化高级认知能力提供了全面框架，可指导下一代具身MLLM的开发。

Abstract: Building robots that can perceive, reason, and act in dynamic, unstructured
environments remains a core challenge. Recent embodied systems often adopt a
dual-system paradigm, where System 2 handles high-level reasoning while System
1 executes low-level control. In this work, we refer to System 2 as the
embodied brain, emphasizing its role as the cognitive core for reasoning and
decision-making in manipulation tasks. Given this role, systematic evaluation
of the embodied brain is essential. Yet existing benchmarks emphasize execution
success, or when targeting high-level reasoning, suffer from incomplete
dimensions and limited task realism, offering only a partial picture of
cognitive capability. To bridge this gap, we introduce RoboBench, a benchmark
that systematically evaluates multimodal large language models (MLLMs) as
embodied brains. Motivated by the critical roles across the full manipulation
pipeline, RoboBench defines five dimensions-instruction comprehension,
perception reasoning, generalized planning, affordance prediction, and failure
analysis-spanning 14 capabilities, 25 tasks, and 6092 QA pairs. To ensure
realism, we curate datasets across diverse embodiments, attribute-rich objects,
and multi-view scenes, drawing from large-scale real robotic data. For
planning, RoboBench introduces an evaluation framework,
MLLM-as-world-simulator. It evaluate embodied feasibility by simulating whether
predicted plans can achieve critical object-state changes. Experiments on 14
MLLMs reveal fundamental limitations: difficulties with implicit instruction
comprehension, spatiotemporal reasoning, cross-scenario planning, fine-grained
affordance understanding, and execution failure diagnosis. RoboBench provides a
comprehensive scaffold to quantify high-level cognition, and guide the
development of next-generation embodied MLLMs. The project page is in

TL;DR: PRISM模型结合了基于分数的扩散预处理、动态图编码器和物理正则化预测头，用于解决长时域多变量时间序列预测中的信号去噪、动态依赖跟踪和物理合理性等挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决长时域多变量时间序列预测的三个关键挑战：对异质信号进行去噪、跟踪时变的跨序列依赖关系、以及保持长期预测的稳定性和物理合理性。

Method: 耦合基于分数的扩散预处理器、动态相关阈值图编码器和通过通用物理惩罚正则化的预测头。

Result: 在六个标准基准测试中，PRISM实现了持续的最先进性能，在MSE和MAE指标上取得了显著提升。

Conclusion: PRISM模型通过理论证明和实验验证，在长时域多变量时间序列预测中表现出强大的鲁棒性和优越性能。

Abstract: Long-horizon multivariate time-series forecasting is challenging because
realistic predictions must (i) denoise heterogeneous signals, (ii) track
time-varying cross-series dependencies, and (iii) remain stable and physically
plausible over long rollout horizons. We present PRISM, which couples a
score-based diffusion preconditioner with a dynamic, correlation-thresholded
graph encoder and a forecast head regularized by generic physics penalties. We
prove contraction of the induced horizon dynamics under mild conditions and
derive Lipschitz bounds for graph blocks, explaining the model's robustness. On
six standard benchmarks , PRISM achieves consistent SOTA with strong MSE and
MAE gains.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GRETEL通过执行验证解决工具检索中的语义-功能差距问题，显著提升了工具检索的性能指标


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于语义相似性的工具检索方法存在语义-功能差距，经常检索到文本相关但功能不可用的工具

Method: GRETEL采用沙盒化的计划-执行-评估循环工作流，对语义检索的候选工具进行系统性实证验证

Result: 在ToolBench基准测试中，所有指标均有显著提升：Pass Rate从0.690提高到0.826，Recall从0.841提高到0.867，NDCG从0.807提高到0.857

Conclusion: 基于执行的验证比单纯语义相似性为工具选择提供了更可靠的基础，能够在实际应用中实现更鲁棒的智能体性能

Abstract: Despite remarkable advances in Large Language Model capabilities, tool
retrieval for agent-based systems remains fundamentally limited by reliance on
semantic similarity, which fails to capture functional viability. Current
methods often retrieve textually relevant but functionally inoperative tools
due to parameter mismatches, authentication failures, and execution
constraints--a phenomenon we term the semantic-functional gap. We introduce
GRETEL, to address this gap through systematic empirical validation. GRETEL
implements an agentic workflow that processes semantically retrieved candidates
through sandboxed plan-execute-evaluate cycles, generating execution-grounded
evidence to distinguish truly functional tools from merely descriptive matches.
Our comprehensive evaluation on the ToolBench benchmark demonstrates
substantial improvements across all metrics: Pass Rate (at 10) increases from
0.690 to 0.826, Recall (at 10) improves from 0.841 to 0.867, and NDCG (at 10)
rises from 0.807 to 0.857.. These results establish that execution-based
validation provides a more reliable foundation for tool selection than semantic
similarity alone, enabling more robust agent performance in real-world
applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RUL预测方法在变化工况下缺乏泛化性和鲁棒性，需要开发更可靠的预测框架。

Method: 使用Res-CNN和Res-LSTM块结合多头注意力和残差连接捕捉时空退化模式，随机森林回归器进行稳定预测，高斯滤波降噪和连续小波变换提取特征。

Result: 在XJTU-SY和PRONOSTIA数据集上测试，CARLE优于多种先进方法，特别是在动态条件下表现更佳。

Conclusion: CARLE框架在RUL预测中表现出优异的性能、鲁棒性和可解释性，为PHM系统提供了可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Prognostic Health Management (PHM) systems monitor and predict equipment
health. A key task is Remaining Useful Life (RUL) estimation, which predicts
how long a component, such as a rolling element bearing, will operate before
failure. Many RUL methods exist but often lack generalizability and robustness
under changing operating conditions. This paper introduces CARLE, a hybrid AI
framework that combines deep and shallow learning to address these challenges.
CARLE uses Res-CNN and Res-LSTM blocks with multi-head attention and residual
connections to capture spatial and temporal degradation patterns, and a Random
Forest Regressor (RFR) for stable, accurate RUL prediction. A compact
preprocessing pipeline applies Gaussian filtering for noise reduction and
Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) for time-frequency feature extraction. We
evaluate CARLE on the XJTU-SY and PRONOSTIA bearing datasets. Ablation studies
measure each component's contribution, while noise and cross-domain experiments
test robustness and generalization. Comparative results show CARLE outperforms
several state-of-the-art methods, especially under dynamic conditions. Finally,
we analyze model interpretability with LIME and SHAP to assess transparency and
trustworthiness.

a two-phase curriculum strategy emphasizing high-gradient regions. To
demonstrate the generality and inductive bias of the proposed framework, we
first validate it on the canonical viscous Burgers equation, which exhibits
advective steepening and shock like gradients.

Motivation: 深度学习开源模型激增，模型融合是结合它们优势的有前景方法，但现有方法存在参数冲突问题，会降低领域特定任务的性能。

Method: 提出MIN-Merging框架，使用路由器机制选择性融合最重要的神经元，以减少参数冲突。

Conclusion: MIN-Merging是解决模型融合中参数冲突问题的有效实用方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have led to a surge of open-source models
across diverse domains. While model merging offers a promising way to combine
their strengths, existing approaches often suffer from parameter conflicts that
degrade performance on domain-specific tasks. We propose MIN-Merging, a
router-based framework that selectively merges the most important neurons to
reduce such conflicts. Extensive experiments on Computer Vision(CV) and Natural

Motivation: 大语言模型在现实应用中的隐私安全问题和需要移除不良知识的需求日益突出，而机器遗忘面临连续异构遗忘需求和分散敏感数据的挑战。

Conclusion: 该方法为处理大语言模型中的连续异构遗忘需求提供了一种可扩展且隐私保护的解决方案，能够平衡遗忘和保留性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into real-world
applications, raising concerns about privacy, security and the need to remove
undesirable knowledge. Machine Unlearning has emerged as a promising solution,
yet faces two key challenges: (1) practical unlearning needs are often
continuous and heterogeneous, and (2) they involve decentralized, sensitive
data with asymmetric access. These factors result in inter-domain and
intra-domain interference, which further amplifies the dilemma of unbalanced
forgetting and retaining performance. In response, we propose a federated
unlearning approach for LLMs that is scalable and privacy preserving. Our
method decouples unlearning and retention via task-specific adapter learning
and employs a hierarchical merging strategy to mitigate conflicting objectives
and enables robust, adaptable unlearning updates. Comprehensive experiments on
benchmarks of WMDP, MUSE, and TOFU showed that our approach effectively handles
heterogeneous unlearning requests while maintaining strong LLM utility compared
with baseline methods.

Motivation: 现有Transformer LLM的标准注意力机制存在二次计算和内存成本问题，而现有研究在算子级比较不完整，上下文并行策略通常是框架特定的，缺乏系统性评估。

Method: 开发了一个模块化、可扩展的统一基准测试框架，整合了代表性注意力内核和上下文并行机制，评估注意力掩码模式和序列长度/分布式规模两个关键维度。

Result: 通过大规模实验实现了可重复的比较，揭示了方法特定的权衡，为长上下文LLM训练中注意力机制的设计和部署提供了实用指导。

Conclusion: 该基准测试填补了系统性评估的空白，为优化长上下文训练中的注意力机制提供了重要参考框架。

Abstract: Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable
success, yet their standard attention mechanism incurs quadratic computation
and memory costs with respect to sequence length, posing a major bottleneck for
long-context training. Prior work tackles this challenge along two directions:
(1) kernel-level optimizations, which accelerate dense and sparse attention
operators; and (2) module-level strategies, often referred to as distributed
attention or context parallel training, which scale attention across multiple
devices. However, systematic evaluation still remains limited: operator-level
comparisons are often incomplete, while context parallel strategies are
typically framework-specific, with unclear performance analysis across
contexts. To address these gaps, we propose a unified benchmark that integrates
representative attention kernels and context parallel mechanisms with a modular
and extensible interface for evaluation. The benchmark evaluates methods along
two critical dimensions: (1) attention mask patterns, which strongly affect
efficiency, scalability, and usability, and (2) sequence length and distributed
scale, which determine performance under extreme long-context training. Through
comprehensive experiments on the cluster of up to 96 GPUs, our benchmark
enables reproducible comparisons, highlights method-specific trade-offs, and
provides practical guidance for designing and deploying attention mechanisms in
long-context LLM training.

Motivation: 结合MoE架构的可扩展性和LoRA的参数高效微调优势，构建端到端可训练的轻量级混合专家模型，实现动态技能组合和高效专业化。

Method: 将MoE专家重新定义为任务专用的低秩适配器集合，通过可微分门控网络计算每个输入token的加权平均参数组合，使用自回归语言建模目标联合优化专家适配器和路由策略。

Result: 提出了L-MoE的完整数学框架，包括可微分路由机制和联合优化目标，为构建更高效、可扩展和专门化的语言模型提供了新路径。

Conclusion: L-MoE创造了一种高度参数高效的MoE模型，具有模块化设计、动态技能组合能力和端到端可训练性，统一了MoE和LoRA两种范式。

Abstract: The Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture enables the scaling of Large
Language Models (LLMs) to trillions of parameters by activating a sparse subset
of weights for each input, maintaining constant computational cost during
inference. Concurrently, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a dominant
technique for parameter-efficiently fine-tuning LLMs on specialized tasks. In
this work, we unify these two paradigms into a novel, end-to-end trainable
framework named L-MoE: a Lightweight Mixture of LoRA Experts. L-MoE redefines
MoE experts not as dense feed-forward networks, but as a collection of
task-specialized, low-rank adapters. A lightweight gating network, trained
jointly with the experts, learns to dynamically compose these LoRA adapters by
computing a weighted average of their parameters for each input token. This
composition is fully differentiable, allowing gradients from a standard
auto-regressive language modeling objective to flow back through the entire
architecture, simultaneously refining both the expert adapters and the routing
strategy. This approach creates a highly parameter-efficient MoE model that is
modular by design, allows for dynamic skill composition, and is trainable from
end-to-end. We present the formal mathematical framework for L-MoE, detailing
the differentiable routing mechanism and the joint optimization objective,
thereby providing a new path toward building more efficient, scalable, and
specialized language models.

TL;DR: 使用大型语言模型自动生成针对自动调优问题的优化算法，这些生成的算法在多个真实应用和硬件平台上能够媲美甚至超越现有最优算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动性能调优对优化高性能应用至关重要，但传统优化算法在不同调优任务中表现不一，没有单一方法在所有情况下都是最优的。

Method: 提出一个框架，通过向LLMs提供问题描述和搜索空间特征来生成专门的优化策略，并进行迭代检查和改进。

Result: 在四个真实自动调优应用和六个硬件平台上评估，生成的算法平均性能提升30.7%和14.6%，最佳生成算法平均比现有最优算法提升72.4%。

Conclusion: LLM生成的优化器能够与人类设计的算法竞争，并在许多情况下超越它们，为自动调优提供了新的有效方法。

Abstract: Automatic performance tuning (auto-tuning) is essential for optimizing
high-performance applications, where vast and irregular parameter spaces make
manual exploration infeasible. Traditionally, auto-tuning relies on
well-established optimization algorithms such as evolutionary algorithms,
annealing methods, or surrogate model-based optimizers to efficiently find
near-optimal configurations. However, designing effective optimizers remains
challenging, as no single method performs best across all tuning tasks.
  In this work, we explore a new paradigm: using large language models (LLMs)
to automatically generate optimization algorithms tailored to auto-tuning
problems. We introduce a framework that prompts LLMs with problem descriptions
and search-space characteristics results to produce specialized optimization
strategies, which are iteratively examined and improved.
  These generated algorithms are evaluated on four real-world auto-tuning
applications across six hardware platforms and compared against the
state-of-the-art in optimization algorithms of two contemporary auto-tuning
frameworks. The evaluation demonstrates that providing additional application-
and search space-specific information in the generation stage results in an
average performance improvement of 30.7\% and 14.6\%, respectively. In
addition, our results show that LLM-generated optimizers can rival, and in
various cases outperform, existing human-designed algorithms, with our
best-performing generated optimization algorithms achieving, on average, 72.4\%
improvement over state-of-the-art optimizers for auto-tuning.

TL;DR: 提出Sherpa.ai Blind Vertical Federated Learning (SBVFL)新范式，通过分布式训练机制显著减少节点与服务器间的通信，相比标准VFL减少约99%通信量，同时保持准确性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 垂直联邦学习(VFL)在训练过程中需要大量通信，这会损害隐私和安全性，导致高能耗，在某些情况下甚至使模型训练不可行。

Method: 采用分布式训练机制，将绝大多数节点更新与服务器解耦，大幅减少节点-服务器通信。

Result: 实验显示SBVFL相比标准VFL减少约99%通信量，同时保持准确性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: SBVFL使得在医疗、金融、制造、航空航天、网络安全和国防等敏感领域的实用、保护隐私的VFL成为可能。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative decentralized training across
multiple parties (nodes) while keeping raw data private. There are two main
paradigms in FL: Horizontal FL (HFL), where all participant nodes share the
same feature space but hold different samples, and Vertical FL (VFL), where
participants hold complementary features for the same samples. While HFL is
widely adopted, VFL is employed in domains where nodes hold complementary
features about the same samples. Still, VFL presents a significant limitation:
the vast number of communications required during training. This compromises
privacy and security, and can lead to high energy consumption, and in some
cases, make model training unfeasible due to the high number of communications.
  In this paper, we introduce Sherpa.ai Blind Vertical Federated Learning
(SBVFL), a novel paradigm that leverages a distributed training mechanism
enhanced for privacy and security. Decoupling the vast majority of node updates
from the server dramatically reduces node-server communication. Experiments
show that SBVFL reduces communication by ~99% compared to standard VFL while
maintaining accuracy and robustness. Therefore, SBVFL enables practical,
privacy-preserving VFL across sensitive domains, including healthcare, finance,
manufacturing, aerospace, cybersecurity, and the defense industry.

### [136] [Uncertainty-Aware Post-Hoc Calibration: Mitigating Confidently Incorrect Predictions Beyond Calibration Metrics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17915)
*Hassan Gharoun,Mohammad Sadegh Khorshidi,Kasra Ranjbarigderi,Fang Chen,Amir H. Gandomi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于预测可靠性评估的后处理校准框架，通过语义相似性将样本分层，对可能正确和可能错误的预测分别采用不同的校准策略，以同时提升校准质量和不确定性感知决策能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经网路校准方法通常采用全局变换，忽视了不同预测的异质性可靠性，且校准改进与不确定性感知决策之间的关系尚未充分探索。

Method: 使用基于邻近性的共形预测将校准样本按特征空间语义相似性分为可能正确和可能错误两组，然后采用双重校准策略：对可能正确预测使用标准等渗回归，对可能错误预测使用欠置信正则化等渗回归降低置信度。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和CIFAR-100数据集上的实验表明，该方法减少了自信错误的预测，在预期校准误差方面与等渗回归和焦点损失基线相比具有竞争力。

Conclusion: 该方法通过实例级自适应性连接了校准和不确定性量化，提供了一种无需模型重训练的后处理解决方案，同时改善了概率对齐和不确定性感知决策。

Abstract: Despite extensive research on neural network calibration, existing methods
typically apply global transformations that treat all predictions uniformly,
overlooking the heterogeneous reliability of individual predictions.
Furthermore, the relationship between improved calibration and effective
uncertainty-aware decision-making remains largely unexplored. This paper
presents a post-hoc calibration framework that leverages prediction reliability
assessment to jointly enhance calibration quality and uncertainty-aware
decision-making. The framework employs proximity-based conformal prediction to
stratify calibration samples into putatively correct and putatively incorrect
groups based on semantic similarity in feature space. A dual calibration
strategy is then applied: standard isotonic regression calibrated confidence in
putatively correct predictions, while underconfidence-regularized isotonic
regression reduces confidence toward uniform distributions for putatively
incorrect predictions, facilitating their identification for further
investigations. A comprehensive evaluation is conducted using calibration
metrics, uncertainty-aware performance measures, and empirical conformal
coverage. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 with BiT and CoAtNet backbones
show that the proposed method achieves lower confidently incorrect predictions,
and competitive Expected Calibration Error compared with isotonic and
focal-loss baselines. This work bridges calibration and uncertainty
quantification through instance-level adaptivity, offering a practical post-hoc
solution that requires no model retraining while improving both probability
alignment and uncertainty-aware decision-making.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对扩散模型的数据遗忘方法，通过时间-频率选择性训练来改善遗忘效果和生成质量，避免了传统方法在所有时间步平均遗忘导致的质量下降问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型数据遗忘方法往往导致生成质量下降或遗忘不完整，主要原因是它们在所有扩散时间步上平均进行遗忘操作，没有考虑不同时间-频率范围对遗忘效果的影响差异。

Method: 采用时间-频率选择性训练方法，根据模型和场景特点有选择地在特定时间-频率范围内进行训练，结合梯度优化和偏好优化目标，适用于图像级和文本到图像任务。

Result: 该方法在多种设置下验证了改进效果，能够生成具有更高美学质量和更低噪声的样本，同时提出了标准化的SSCD评估指标来全面评估遗忘效果和质量。

Conclusion: 通过时间-频率选择性方法，为扩散模型数据遗忘提供了更清晰的理解和实用策略，显著提升了遗忘性能和评估效果。

Abstract: Data unlearning aims to remove the influence of specific training samples
from a trained model without requiring full retraining. Unlike concept
unlearning, data unlearning in diffusion models remains underexplored and often
suffers from quality degradation or incomplete forgetting. To address this, we
first observe that most existing methods attempt to unlearn the samples at all
diffusion time steps equally, leading to poor-quality generation. We argue that
forgetting occurs disproportionately across time and frequency, depending on
the model and scenarios. By selectively focusing on specific time-frequency
ranges during training, we achieve samples with higher aesthetic quality and
lower noise. We validate this improvement by applying our time-frequency
selective approach to diverse settings, including gradient-based and preference
optimization objectives, as well as both image-level and text-to-image tasks.
Finally, to evaluate both deletion and quality of unlearned data samples, we
propose a simple normalized version of SSCD. Together, our analysis and methods
establish a clearer understanding of the unique challenges in data unlearning
for diffusion models, providing practical strategies to improve both evaluation
and unlearning performance.

TL;DR: COMPASS是一种无需外部监督的测试时奖励机制，通过双校准答案奖励和决定性路径奖励来增强语言模型的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前强化学习在语言模型中依赖人工标注数据的可扩展性瓶颈，探索在无标注数据上的自主学习。

Method: 提出COMPASS框架，包含双校准答案奖励（DCAR）和决定性路径奖励（DPR），分别稳定训练伪标签和优化推理过程质量。

Result: 在多样化推理任务和模型架构上实现了显著且一致的性能提升。

Conclusion: COMPASS为语言模型从连续经验中学习提供了更可扩展的方向。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for advancing
Large Language Models (LLMs), achieving remarkable performance in complex
reasoning domains such as mathematics and code generation. However, current RL
methods face a fundamental scalability bottleneck due to their heavy reliance
on human-curated preference data or labeled datasets for reward modeling. To
overcome this limitation, we explore RL on unlabeled data where models learn
autonomously from continuous experience streams. The core challenge in this
setting lies in reliable reward estimation without ground-truth supervision.
Existing approaches like Test-Time RL address this through self-consistent
consensus, but risk reinforcing incorrect pseudo-labels derived from majority
voting. We introduce COMPASS (Composite Path and Answer Self-Scoring), a novel
test-time reward mechanism that operates without external supervision. COMPASS
integrates two complementary components: the Dual-Calibration Answer Reward
(DCAR), which stabilizes training by establishing trustworthy pseudo-labels
through confidence and credibility calibration, and the Decisive Path Reward
(DPR), which directly optimizes the reasoning process quality beyond mere
outcome supervision. By jointly reinforcing trustworthy consensus answers and
highly decisive reasoning chains, the COMPASS systematically enhances the
model's analytical capabilities. Extensive experiments show that COMPASS
achieves significant and consistent performance gains across diverse reasoning
tasks and model architectures, advancing a more scalable direction for LLMs to
learn from continuous experience.

Motivation: 构建可泛化的合成可验证数据面临生成容易产生幻觉、验证构件薄弱或琐碎等挑战，现有方法依赖任务特定启发式或后处理过滤器，缺乏原则性的通用可验证性评估器。

Method: 采用进化式、任务无关、策略引导的可执行检查数据合成框架，通过一致性评估器强制执行人工标注和策略诱导检查之间的一致性，将过滤升级为原则性合成。

Result: 实验表明该方法在RLVR和模型蒸馏训练范式下均有效，在LiveCodeBench和AgentBench-OS任务上取得显著改进，展示了框架的鲁棒泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该框架能够可靠地组装连贯、可验证的训练实例，无需领域特定规则即可泛化，为可验证数据合成提供了原则性解决方案。

Abstract: Reliable verifiable data has become a key driver of capability gains in
modern language models, enabling stable reinforcement learning with verifiable
rewards and effective distillation that transfers competence across math,
coding, and agentic tasks. Yet constructing generalizable synthetic verifiable
data remains difficult due to hallucination-prone generation, and weak or
trivial verification artifacts that fail to separate strong from weak
solutions. Existing approaches often rely on task-specific heuristics or
post-hoc filters that do not transfer across domains and lack a principled,
universal evaluator of verifiability. In this work, we introduce an
evolutionary, task-agnostic, strategy-guided, executably-checkable data
synthesis framework that, from minimal seed supervision, jointly synthesizes
problems, diverse candidate solutions, and verification artifacts, and
iteratively discovers strategies via a consistency-based evaluator that
enforces agreement between human-annotated and strategy-induced checks. This
pipeline upgrades filtering into principled synthesis: it reliably assembles
coherent, verifiable training instances and generalizes without domain-specific
rules. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach
under both RLVR and model distillation training paradigms. The results show
that training with our synthesized data yields significant improvements on both
the LiveCodeBench and AgentBench-OS tasks, highlighting the robust
generalization of our framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 混沌时间序列中的变点检测困难，因为观测空间信号与内在变异性纠缠在一起，需要更有效的方法来分离这些影响。

Method: 两阶段框架：首先使用基于模拟推理训练的神经后验估计器进行参数推断的摊销化，然后在生成的参数轨迹上应用标准变点检测算法。

Result: 在Lorenz-63模型中，相比观测空间基线方法，Param-CPD提高了F1分数，减少了定位误差，降低了误报率。

Conclusion: 在物理可解释的参数空间中操作，能够在非线性动力系统中实现准确且可解释的变点检测。

Abstract: Detecting regime shifts in chaotic time series is hard because
observation-space signals are entangled with intrinsic variability. We propose
Parameter--Space Changepoint Detection (Param--CPD), a two--stage framework
that first amortizes Bayesian inference of governing parameters with a neural
posterior estimator trained by simulation-based inference, and then applies a
standard CPD algorithm to the resulting parameter trajectory. On Lorenz--63
with piecewise-constant parameters, Param--CPD improves F1, reduces
localization error, and lowers false positives compared to observation--space
baselines. We further verify identifiability and calibration of the inferred
posteriors on stationary trajectories, explaining why parameter space offers a
cleaner detection signal. Robustness analyses over tolerance, window length,
and noise indicate consistent gains. Our results show that operating in a
physically interpretable parameter space enables accurate and interpretable
changepoint detection in nonlinear dynamical systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文分析了Transition Matching(TM)何时以及为何优于Flow Matching(FM)，发现在单峰高斯分布中TM能达到更低的KL散度，在混合高斯分布中当模式分离良好且方差不可忽略时TM表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管Flow Matching是许多最先进生成模型的基础，但最近结果表明Transition Matching可以用更少的采样步骤获得更高质量。本文旨在回答TM何时以及为何优于FM的问题。

Method: 首先在单峰高斯分布场景下证明TM获得更低的KL散度，然后扩展到混合高斯分布，分析局部单峰性机制，并通过理论分析和实验验证。

Result: TM在单峰高斯分布中收敛速度更快，在混合高斯分布中当模式分离良好且方差不可忽略时表现优于FM，但当目标方差趋近于零时TM优势减弱。

Conclusion: TM在目标分布具有良好分离的模式和不可忽略的方差时优于FM，这一结论在理论分析和实际图像、视频生成应用中得到了验证。

Abstract: Flow Matching (FM) underpins many state-of-the-art generative models, yet
recent results indicate that Transition Matching (TM) can achieve higher
quality with fewer sampling steps. This work answers the question of when and
why TM outperforms FM. First, when the target is a unimodal Gaussian
distribution, we prove that TM attains strictly lower KL divergence than FM for
finite number of steps. The improvement arises from stochastic difference
latent updates in TM, which preserve target covariance that deterministic FM
underestimates. We then characterize convergence rates, showing that TM
achieves faster convergence than FM under a fixed compute budget, establishing
its advantage in the unimodal Gaussian setting. Second, we extend the analysis
to Gaussian mixtures and identify local-unimodality regimes in which the
sampling dynamics approximate the unimodal case, where TM can outperform FM.
The approximation error decreases as the minimal distance between component
means increases, highlighting that TM is favored when the modes are well
separated. However, when the target variance approaches zero, each TM update
converges to the FM update, and the performance advantage of TM diminishes. In
summary, we show that TM outperforms FM when the target distribution has
well-separated modes and non-negligible variances. We validate our theoretical
results with controlled experiments on Gaussian distributions, and extend the
comparison to real-world applications in image and video generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度子空间聚类方法存在局限性：使用浅层自编码器忽略聚类误差、强调全局特征而忽略局部结构、无法建模长程依赖和位置信息、很少应用于4D时空数据。

Method: 结合U-Net启发的生成器（使用堆叠TimeDistributed ConvLSTM2D层保持时空完整性）和图注意力变换器自表达网络，捕捉局部空间关系、全局依赖以及短长程相关性。

Result: 在三个真实世界多元时空数据集上的实验表明，A-DATSC相比最先进的深度子空间聚类模型实现了显著优越的聚类性能。

Conclusion: A-DATSC通过注意力引导的深度对抗时序子空间聚类方法，有效解决了现有方法在4D时空数据聚类中的局限性，取得了更好的聚类效果。

Abstract: Deep subspace clustering models are vital for applications such as snowmelt
detection, sea ice tracking, crop health monitoring, infectious disease
modeling, network load prediction, and land-use planning, where multivariate
spatiotemporal data exhibit complex temporal dependencies and reside on
multiple nonlinear manifolds beyond the capability of traditional clustering
methods. These models project data into a latent space where samples lie in
linear subspaces and exploit the self-expressiveness property to uncover
intrinsic relationships. Despite their success, existing methods face major
limitations: they use shallow autoencoders that ignore clustering errors,
emphasize global features while neglecting local structure, fail to model
long-range dependencies and positional information, and are rarely applied to
4D spatiotemporal data. To address these issues, we propose A-DATSC
(Attention-Guided Deep Adversarial Temporal Subspace Clustering), a model
combining a deep subspace clustering generator and a quality-verifying
discriminator. The generator, inspired by U-Net, preserves spatial and temporal
integrity through stacked TimeDistributed ConvLSTM2D layers, reducing
parameters and enhancing generalization. A graph attention transformer based
self-expressive network captures local spatial relationships, global
dependencies, and both short- and long-range correlations. Experiments on three
real-world multivariate spatiotemporal datasets show that A-DATSC achieves
substantially superior clustering performance compared to state-of-the-art deep
subspace clustering models.

Abstract: Neural activity forecasting is central to understanding neural systems and
enabling closed-loop control. While deep learning has recently advanced the
state-of-the-art in the time series forecasting literature, its application to
neural activity forecasting remains limited. To bridge this gap, we
systematically evaluated eight probabilistic deep learning models, including
two foundation models, that have demonstrated strong performance on general
forecasting benchmarks. We compared them against four classical statistical
models and two baseline methods on spontaneous neural activity recorded from
mouse cortex via widefield imaging. Across prediction horizons, several deep
learning models consistently outperformed classical approaches, with the best
model producing informative forecasts up to 1.5 seconds into the future. Our
findings point toward future control applications and open new avenues for
probing the intrinsic temporal structure of neural activity.

Conclusion: 该框架建立了跨域算子推断的通用原则，能够在物理、气候和能源系统中实现复杂时空场的实时预测。

Abstract: Forecasting unobservable physical quantities from sparse, cross-domain sensor
data is a central unsolved problem in scientific machine learning. Existing
neural operators and large-scale forecasters rely on dense, co-located
input-output fields and short temporal contexts, assumptions that fail in
real-world systems where sensing and prediction occur on distinct physical
manifolds and over long timescales. We introduce the Spatio-Temporal Operator
Network (STONe), a non-autoregressive neural operator that learns a stable
functional mapping between heterogeneous domains. By directly inferring
high-altitude radiation dose fields from sparse ground-based neutron
measurements, STONe demonstrates that operator learning can generalize beyond
shared-domain settings. It defines a nonlinear operator between sensor and
target manifolds that remains stable over long forecasting horizons without
iterative recurrence. This challenges the conventional view that operator
learning requires domain alignment or autoregressive propagation. Trained on 23
years of global neutron data, STONe achieves accurate 180-day forecasts with
millisecond inference latency. The framework establishes a general principle
for cross-domain operator inference, enabling real-time prediction of complex
spatiotemporal fields in physics, climate, and energy systems.

Conclusion: ACIA为稳健的反因果学习提供了有效框架，具有理论保证的分布外泛化能力。

Abstract: Causal representation learning in the anti-causal setting (labels cause
features rather than the reverse) presents unique challenges requiring
specialized approaches. We propose Anti-Causal Invariant Abstractions (ACIA), a
novel measure-theoretic framework for anti-causal representation learning. ACIA
employs a two-level design, low-level representations capture how labels
generate observations, while high-level representations learn stable causal
patterns across environment-specific variations. ACIA addresses key limitations
of existing approaches by accommodating prefect and imperfect interventions
through interventional kernels, eliminating dependency on explicit causal
structures, handling high-dimensional data effectively, and providing
theoretical guarantees for out-of-distribution generalization. Experiments on
synthetic and real-world medical datasets demonstrate that ACIA consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and invariance metrics.
Furthermore, our theoretical results establish tight bounds on performance gaps
between training and unseen environments, confirming the efficacy of our
approach for robust anti-causal learning.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖固定发散正则化，导致两难困境：强正则化保留模型能力但限制奖励优化，弱正则化可实现更好对齐但存在不稳定或奖励黑客风险。

Conclusion: ADRPO为不同生成架构和模态的探索-利用挑战提供了有效的即插即用解决方案，在文本、图像和音频推理任务中均展现出卓越性能。

Abstract: Balancing exploration and exploitation during reinforcement learning
fine-tuning of generative models presents a critical challenge, as existing
approaches rely on fixed divergence regularization that creates an inherent
dilemma: strong regularization preserves model capabilities but limits reward
optimization, while weak regularization enables greater alignment but risks
instability or reward hacking. We introduce Adaptive Divergence Regularized
Policy Optimization (ADRPO), which automatically adjusts regularization
strength based on advantage estimates-reducing regularization for high-value
samples while applying stronger regularization to poor samples, enabling
policies to navigate between exploration and aggressive exploitation according
to data quality. Our implementation with Wasserstein-2 regularization for flow
matching generative models achieves remarkable results on text-to-image
generation, achieving better semantic alignment and diversity than offline
methods like DPO and online methods with fixed regularization like ORW-CFM-W2.
ADRPO enables a 2B parameter SD3 model to surpass much larger models with 4.8B
and 12B parameters in attribute binding, semantic consistency, artistic style
transfer, and compositional control while maintaining generation diversity.
ADRPO generalizes to KL-regularized fine-tuning of both text-only LLMs and
multi-modal reasoning models, enhancing existing online RL methods like GRPO.
In LLM fine-tuning, ADRPO demonstrates an emergent ability to escape local
optima through active exploration, while in multi-modal audio reasoning, it
outperforms GRPO through superior step-by-step reasoning, enabling a 7B model
to outperform substantially larger commercial models including Gemini 2.5 Pro
and GPT-4o Audio, offering an effective plug-and-play solution to the
exploration-exploitation challenge across diverse generative architectures and
modalities.

Abstract: Developing autonomous vehicles (AVs) requires not only safety and efficiency,
but also realistic, human-like behaviors that are socially aware and
predictable. Achieving this requires sim agent policies that are human-like,
fast, and scalable in multi-agent settings. Recent progress in imitation
learning with large diffusion-based or tokenized models has shown that
behaviors can be captured directly from human driving data, producing realistic
policies. However, these models are computationally expensive, slow during
inference, and struggle to adapt in reactive, closed-loop scenarios. In
contrast, self-play reinforcement learning (RL) scales efficiently and
naturally captures multi-agent interactions, but it often relies on heuristics
and reward shaping, and the resulting policies can diverge from human norms. We
propose SPACeR, a framework that leverages a pretrained tokenized
autoregressive motion model as a centralized reference policy to guide
decentralized self-play. The reference model provides likelihood rewards and KL
divergence, anchoring policies to the human driving distribution while
preserving RL scalability. Evaluated on the Waymo Sim Agents Challenge, our
method achieves competitive performance with imitation-learned policies while
being up to 10x faster at inference and 50x smaller in parameter size than
large generative models. In addition, we demonstrate in closed-loop ego
planning evaluation tasks that our sim agents can effectively measure planner
quality with fast and scalable traffic simulation, establishing a new paradigm
for testing autonomous driving policies.

Abstract: Flow-based generative models have shown remarkable success in text-to-image
generation, yet fine-tuning them with intermediate feedback remains
challenging, especially for continuous-time flow matching models. Most existing
approaches solely learn from outcome rewards, struggling with the credit
assignment problem. Alternative methods that attempt to learn a critic via
direct regression on cumulative rewards often face training instabilities and
model collapse in online settings. We present AC-Flow, a robust actor-critic
framework that addresses these challenges through three key innovations: (1)
reward shaping that provides well-normalized learning signals to enable stable
intermediate value learning and gradient control, (2) a novel dual-stability
mechanism that combines advantage clipping to prevent destructive policy
updates with a warm-up phase that allows the critic to mature before
influencing the actor, and (3) a scalable generalized critic weighting scheme
that extends traditional reward-weighted methods while preserving model
diversity through Wasserstein regularization. Through extensive experiments on
Stable Diffusion 3, we demonstrate that AC-Flow achieves state-of-the-art
performance in text-to-image alignment tasks and generalization to unseen human
preference models. Our results demonstrate that even with a computationally
efficient critic model, we can robustly finetune flow models without
compromising generative quality, diversity, or stability.

### [150] [Provably Optimal Reinforcement Learning under Safety Filtering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18082)
*Donggeon David Oh,Duy P. Nguyen,Haimin Hu,Jaime F. Fisac*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文证明了在强化学习中使用足够宽松的安全过滤器不会降低渐近性能，实现了安全性和性能的完全分离。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习在复杂任务中应用时缺乏正式的安全保证，限制了其在安全关键场景中的使用。安全过滤器虽然能防止失败，但通常被认为会牺牲性能和阻碍学习过程。

Method: 提出了安全关键马尔可夫决策过程(SC-MDP)和过滤MDP的框架，证明在过滤MDP中学习是安全的，标准RL收敛性仍然成立，且最优策略在过滤MDP中能达到与SC-MDP中最佳安全策略相同的渐近回报。

Result: 在Safety Gymnasium上的实验验证了理论，训练期间零违规，最终性能匹配或超过无过滤基线。

Conclusion: 为安全强化学习提供了一个简单而原则性的方法：使用可用的最宽松安全过滤器来训练和部署RL策略。

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) enable its use on increasingly
complex tasks, but the lack of formal safety guarantees still limits its
application in safety-critical settings. A common practical approach is to
augment the RL policy with a safety filter that overrides unsafe actions to
prevent failures during both training and deployment. However, safety filtering
is often perceived as sacrificing performance and hindering the learning
process. We show that this perceived safety-performance tradeoff is not
inherent and prove, for the first time, that enforcing safety with a
sufficiently permissive safety filter does not degrade asymptotic performance.
We formalize RL safety with a safety-critical Markov decision process (SC-MDP),
which requires categorical, rather than high-probability, avoidance of
catastrophic failure states. Additionally, we define an associated filtered MDP
in which all actions result in safe effects, thanks to a safety filter that is
considered to be a part of the environment. Our main theorem establishes that
(i) learning in the filtered MDP is safe categorically, (ii) standard RL
convergence carries over to the filtered MDP, and (iii) any policy that is
optimal in the filtered MDP-when executed through the same filter-achieves the
same asymptotic return as the best safe policy in the SC-MDP, yielding a
complete separation between safety enforcement and performance optimization. We
validate the theory on Safety Gymnasium with representative tasks and
constraints, observing zero violations during training and final performance
matching or exceeding unfiltered baselines. Together, these results shed light
on a long-standing question in safety-filtered learning and provide a simple,
principled recipe for safe RL: train and deploy RL policies with the most
permissive safety filter that is available.

*Nadir Farhi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种可靠强化学习框架，旨在最大化累积回报超过给定阈值的概率，而非传统RL的期望回报最大化。通过状态增强表示，可将该问题转化为标准RL问题，从而利用现有算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多实际应用（如路由、资源分配、风险决策）不仅需要高平均性能，还需要保证成功概率。传统RL关注期望回报最大化，无法满足可靠性要求。

Method: 通过状态增强表示将可靠RL问题重新表述为标准RL问题，允许使用现有RL算法（如Q-learning、Dueling Double DQN）而无需新框架。

Result: 理论证明两种表述的等价性，数值实验显示该方法能有效平衡效率和可靠性，在可靠路由问题中成功最大化到达目的地的概率。

Conclusion: 可靠RL框架为随机和安全关键环境应用提供了实用解决方案，能够直接利用现有RL算法实现性能保证。

Abstract: In this work, we address the problem of determining reliable policies in
reinforcement learning (RL), with a focus on optimization under uncertainty and
the need for performance guarantees. While classical RL algorithms aim at
maximizing the expected return, many real-world applications - such as routing,
resource allocation, or sequential decision-making under risk - require
strategies that ensure not only high average performance but also a guaranteed
probability of success. To this end, we propose a novel formulation in which
the objective is to maximize the probability that the cumulative return exceeds
a prescribed threshold. We demonstrate that this reliable RL problem can be
reformulated, via a state-augmented representation, into a standard RL problem,
thereby allowing the use of existing RL and deep RL algorithms without the need
for entirely new algorithmic frameworks. Theoretical results establish the
equivalence of the two formulations and show that reliable strategies can be
derived by appropriately adapting well-known methods such as Q-learning or
Dueling Double DQN. To illustrate the practical relevance of the approach, we
consider the problem of reliable routing, where the goal is not to minimize the
expected travel time but rather to maximize the probability of reaching the
destination within a given time budget. Numerical experiments confirm that the
proposed formulation leads to policies that effectively balance efficiency and
reliability, highlighting the potential of reliable RL for applications in
stochastic and safety-critical environments.

Conclusion: 该数据库为开发先进的基于机器学习的异常检测方法铺平了道路，特别支持可解释ML方法和异常缓解策略的开发。

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) holds great potential to advance anomaly detection (AD)
in chemical processes. However, the development of ML-based methods is hindered
by the lack of openly available experimental data. To address this gap, we have
set up a laboratory-scale batch distillation plant and operated it to generate
an extensive experimental database, covering fault-free experiments and
experiments in which anomalies were intentionally induced, for training
advanced ML-based AD methods. In total, 119 experiments were conducted across a
wide range of operating conditions and mixtures. Most experiments containing
anomalies were paired with a corresponding fault-free one. The database that we
provide here includes time-series data from numerous sensors and actuators,
along with estimates of measurement uncertainty. In addition, unconventional
data sources -- such as concentration profiles obtained via online benchtop NMR
spectroscopy and video and audio recordings -- are provided. Extensive metadata
and expert annotations of all experiments are included. The anomaly annotations
are based on an ontology developed in this work. The data are organized in a
structured database and made freely available via
doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17395544. This new database paves the way for the
development of advanced ML-based AD methods. As it includes information on the
causes of anomalies, it further enables the development of interpretable and
explainable ML approaches, as well as methods for anomaly mitigation.

Motivation: 传统方法无法捕捉脑磁图等模态中复杂的时空模式，而深度学习基础模型在其他领域已取得显著进展，因此需要开发专门用于脑电生理数据的基础模型。

Method: 引入基于Transformer的MEG-GPT模型，使用时间注意力和下一时间点预测，开发了数据驱动的tokenizer来保持连续MEG信号的高时间分辨率，在大规模MEG数据集上进行训练。

Result: 模型生成的脑活动数据具有真实的时空频谱特性，在下游解码任务中表现优异，跨会话准确率从0.54提升至0.59，跨被试准确率从0.41提升至0.49，并能通过微调进一步提升性能。

Conclusion: 这项工作为电生理数据建立了强大的基础模型，为计算神经科学和神经解码应用开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Modelling the complex spatiotemporal patterns of large-scale brain dynamics
is crucial for neuroscience, but traditional methods fail to capture the rich
structure in modalities such as magnetoencephalography (MEG). Recent advances
in deep learning have enabled significant progress in other domains, such as
language and vision, by using foundation models at scale. Here, we introduce
MEG-GPT, a transformer based foundation model that uses time-attention and next
time-point prediction. To facilitate this, we also introduce a novel
data-driven tokeniser for continuous MEG data, which preserves the high
temporal resolution of continuous MEG signals without lossy transformations. We
trained MEG-GPT on tokenised brain region time-courses extracted from a
large-scale MEG dataset (N=612, eyes-closed rest, Cam-CAN data), and show that
the learnt model can generate data with realistic spatio-spectral properties,
including transient events and population variability. Critically, it performs
well in downstream decoding tasks, improving downstream supervised prediction
task, showing improved zero-shot generalisation across sessions (improving
accuracy from 0.54 to 0.59) and subjects (improving accuracy from 0.41 to 0.49)
compared to a baseline methods. Furthermore, we show the model can be
efficiently fine-tuned on a smaller labelled dataset to boost performance in
cross-subject decoding scenarios. This work establishes a powerful foundation
model for electrophysiological data, paving the way for applications in
computational neuroscience and neural decoding.

TL;DR: ADA是一种推理时防御方法，通过在生成过程中重新引入助手头令牌来解锁LLMs的浅层对齐能力，实现任意生成深度的安全保护。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs存在浅层对齐问题：在助手轮开始时能直接拒绝有害查询，但一旦有害内容开始生成，这种保护就会崩溃。需要确保在任意生成深度都能保持安全性。

Method: 提出Any-Depth Alignment (ADA)，基于观察发现对齐能力集中在助手头令牌中。通过在生成过程中重新引入这些令牌，诱导模型重新评估有害性并恢复拒绝能力。

Result: 在多个开源模型家族上，ADA实现了接近100%的拒绝率，显著降低对抗性提示攻击成功率至3%以下，同时保持良性任务的实用性。

Conclusion: ADA是一种有效的推理时防御方法，无需修改模型参数即可解锁LLMs的固有对齐能力，确保任意生成深度的安全保护。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong but shallow alignment: they
directly refuse harmful queries when a refusal is expected at the very start of
an assistant turn, yet this protection collapses once a harmful continuation is
underway (either through the adversarial attacks or via harmful
assistant-prefill attacks). This raises a fundamental question: Can the innate
shallow alignment in LLMs be unlocked to ensure safety at arbitrary generation
depths? To achieve this goal, we propose Any-Depth Alignment (ADA), an
effective inference-time defense with negligible overhead. ADA is built based
on our observation that alignment is concentrated in the assistant header
tokens through repeated use in shallow-refusal training, and these tokens
possess the model's strong alignment priors. By reintroducing these tokens
mid-stream, ADA induces the model to reassess harmfulness and recover refusals
at any point in generation. Across diverse open-source model families (Llama,
Gemma, Mistral, Qwen, DeepSeek, and gpt-oss), ADA achieves robust safety
performance without requiring any changes to the base model's parameters. It
secures a near-100% refusal rate against challenging adversarial prefill
attacks ranging from dozens to thousands of tokens. Furthermore, ADA reduces
the average success rate of prominent adversarial prompt attacks (such as GCG,
AutoDAN, PAIR, and TAP) to below 3%. This is all accomplished while preserving
utility on benign tasks with minimal over-refusal. ADA maintains this
resilience even after the base model undergoes subsequent instruction tuning
(benign or adversarial).

Motivation: 准确早期预测ICU患者院内死亡率对于及时临床干预和资源分配至关重要

Method: 使用LASSO和XGBoost进行特征选择，结合TF-IDF和BERT处理文本特征，构建多变量逻辑回归模型

Result: 结合结构化数据和文本特征的模型AUC达到0.918，相比仅使用结构化数据的0.753，相对提升22%

Conclusion: 非结构化临床笔记具有额外的预后价值，应整合到可解释的特征驱动风险预测模型中

Abstract: Accurate early prediction of in-hospital mortality in intensive care units
(ICUs) is essential for timely clinical intervention and efficient resource
allocation. This study develops and evaluates machine learning models that
integrate both structured clinical data and unstructured textual information,
specifically discharge summaries and radiology reports, from the MIMIC-IV
database. We used LASSO and XGBoost for feature selection, followed by a
multivariate logistic regression trained on the top features identified by both
models. Incorporating textual features using TF-IDF and BERT embeddings
significantly improved predictive performance. The final logistic regression
model, which combined structured and textual input, achieved an AUC of 0.918,
compared to 0.753 when using structured data alone, a relative improvement 22%.
The analysis of the decision curve demonstrated a superior standardized net
benefit in a wide range of threshold probabilities (0.2-0.8), confirming the
clinical utility of the model. These results underscore the added prognostic
value of unstructured clinical notes and support their integration into
interpretable feature-driven risk prediction models for ICU patients.

TL;DR: 提出潜在离散扩散模型(LDDMs)，通过结合离散token的掩码扩散和连续潜在嵌入的扩散，改善少步生成质量，解决了传统掩码去噪器在联合结构建模上的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统掩码去噪器的反向转换通常在各位置间独立进行，这会削弱联合结构建模能力，在少步生成时导致质量下降。

Method: 提出LDDMs模型，耦合离散token的掩码扩散和连续潜在嵌入的扩散。提供两种实现：FUJI-LDDMs（联合去噪token和潜在变量）和SEQ-LDDMs（先解析潜在变量再条件解析离散链）。

Result: 在无条件生成指标上相比最先进的掩码离散扩散基线有所改进，在较低采样预算下特别有效，适合每步去掩码多个token的场景。

Conclusion: LDDMs通过引入潜在通道提供更柔和的信号和跨token依赖关系，有效解决了掩码去噪器的局限性，在少步生成中表现出色。

Abstract: We study discrete diffusion for language and other categorical data and focus
on a common limitation of masked denoisers: reverse transitions typically
factorize across positions, which can weaken joint structure and degrade
quality in few-step generation. We propose \emph{Latent Discrete Diffusion
Models} (LDDMs), which couple a masked discrete diffusion over tokens with a
continuous diffusion over latent embeddings. The latent channel provides a
softer signal and carries cross-token dependencies that help resolve
ambiguities. We present two instantiations: (i) FUJI-LDDMs, which perform fully
joint denoising of tokens and latents, and (ii) SEQ-LDDMs, which sequentially
resolve the latent and then the discrete chain conditionally on it. For both
variants we derive ELBO-style objectives and discuss design choices to learn
informative latents yet amenable to diffusoin modeling. In experiments, LDDMs
yield improvements on unconditional generation metrics as compared to
state-of-the-art masked discrete diffusion baselines, and are effective at
lower sampling budgets, where unmasking many tokens per step is desirable.

Motivation: 分析Rectified Flows中直线路径目标存在的根本失效模式，特别是在确定性训练下导致记忆化的问题。

Method: 通过高斯到高斯传输研究损失梯度方差，分析随机和确定性机制下优化的向量场偏好，并在CelebA数据集上进行实证验证。

Result: 确定性插值会导致记忆化，在推理时重现训练配对；而注入小噪声可以恢复泛化能力。

Conclusion: Rectified Flows的直线路径目标在确定性训练下会收敛到记忆化向量场，需要噪声注入来确保泛化性能。

Abstract: Rectified Flows learn ODE vector fields whose trajectories are straight
between source and target distributions, enabling near one-step inference. We
show that this straight-path objective conceals fundamental failure modes:
under deterministic training, low gradient variance drives memorization of
arbitrary training pairings, even when interpolant lines between pairs
intersect. To analyze this mechanism, we study Gaussian-to-Gaussian transport
and use the loss gradient variance across stochastic and deterministic regimes
to characterize which vector fields optimization favors in each setting. We
then show that, in a setting where all interpolating lines intersect, applying
Rectified Flow yields the same specific pairings at inference as during
training. More generally, we prove that a memorizing vector field exists even
when training interpolants intersect, and that optimizing the straight-path
objective converges to this ill-defined field. At inference, deterministic
integration reproduces the exact training pairings. We validate our findings
empirically on the CelebA dataset, confirming that deterministic interpolants
induce memorization, while the injection of small noise restores
generalization.

Motivation: 现有系统中，核心注意力与其他层共存，在长上下文长度下，其二次计算增长导致数据和平行管道组之间的负载不平衡和拖尾效应。

Method: 将核心注意力分解为token级任务，调度到专用注意力服务器，动态重新批处理任务以平衡计算而不牺牲内核效率，使用DistCA系统实现乒乓执行方案。

Conclusion: CAD技术有效解决了长上下文LLM训练中的负载不平衡问题，通过核心注意力解耦显著提升了训练效率。

Abstract: We present core attention disaggregation (CAD), a technique that improves
long-context large language model training by decoupling the core attention
computation, softmax(QK^T)V, from the rest of the model and executing it on a
separate pool of devices. In existing systems, core attention is colocated with
other layers; at long context lengths, its quadratic compute growth compared to
the near-linear growth of other components causes load imbalance and stragglers
across data and pipeline parallel groups. CAD is enabled by two observations.
First, core attention is stateless: it has no trainable parameters and only
minimal transient data, so balancing reduces to scheduling compute-bound tasks.
Second, it is composable: modern attention kernels retain high efficiency when
processing fused batches of token-level shards with arbitrary lengths. CAD
partitions core attention into token-level tasks and dispatches them to
dedicated attention servers, which dynamically rebatch tasks to equalize
compute without sacrificing kernel efficiency. We implement CAD in a system
called DistCA, which uses a ping-pong execution scheme to fully overlap
communication with computation and in-place execution on attention servers to
reduce memory use. On 512 H200 GPUs and context lengths up to 512k tokens,
DistCA improves end-to-end training throughput by up to 1.35x, eliminates data
and pipeline parallel stragglers, and achieves near-perfect compute and memory
balance.

Conclusion: HyDiF框架为基于场的分子建模提供了一个有前景的方向，克服了传统离散表示的局限性，在生成和预测任务上表现出色。

Abstract: We introduce HyperDiffusionFields (HyDiF), a framework that models 3D
molecular conformers as continuous fields rather than discrete atomic
coordinates or graphs. At the core of our approach is the Molecular Directional
Field (MDF), a vector field that maps any point in space to the direction of
the nearest atom of a particular type. We represent MDFs using
molecule-specific neural implicit fields, which we call Molecular Neural Fields
(MNFs). To enable learning across molecules and facilitate generalization, we
adopt an approach where a shared hypernetwork, conditioned on a molecule,
generates the weights of the given molecule's MNF. To endow the model with
generative capabilities, we train the hypernetwork as a denoising diffusion
model, enabling sampling in the function space of molecular fields. Our design
naturally extends to a masked diffusion mechanism to support
structure-conditioned generation tasks, such as molecular inpainting, by
selectively noising regions of the field. Beyond generation, the localized and
continuous nature of MDFs enables spatially fine-grained feature extraction for
molecular property prediction, something not easily achievable with graph or
point cloud based methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our approach scales
to larger biomolecules, illustrating a promising direction for field-based
molecular modeling.

Abstract: Motivated by the recently shown connection between self-attention and

PCA. Using the difference-of-convex (DC) framework, we present several novel
formulations and provide new theoretical insights. In particular, we show the
kernelizability and out-of-sample applicability for a PCA-like family of
problems. Moreover, we uncover that simultaneous iteration, which is connected
to the classical QR algorithm, is an instance of the difference-of-convex
algorithm (DCA), offering an optimization perspective on this longstanding
method. Further, we describe new algorithms for PCA and empirically compare
them with state-of-the-art methods. Lastly, we introduce a kernelizable dual
formulation for a robust variant of PCA that minimizes the $l_1$ deviation of
the reconstruction errors.

Conclusion: NashPG算法能够在保持策略梯度方法通用性的同时，稳定收敛到精确纳什均衡，适用于大规模不完全信息博弈。

Abstract: Finding Nash equilibria in imperfect-information games remains a central
challenge in multi-agent reinforcement learning. While regularization-based
methods have recently achieved last-iteration convergence to a regularized
equilibrium, they require the regularization strength to shrink toward zero to
approximate a Nash equilibrium, often leading to unstable learning in practice.
Instead, we fix the regularization strength at a large value for robustness and
achieve convergence by iteratively refining the reference policy. Our main
theoretical result shows that this procedure guarantees strictly monotonic
improvement and convergence to an exact Nash equilibrium in two-player zero-sum
games, without requiring a uniqueness assumption. Building on this framework,
we develop a practical algorithm, Nash Policy Gradient (NashPG), which
preserves the generalizability of policy gradient methods while relying solely
on the current and reference policies. Empirically, NashPG achieves comparable
or lower exploitability than prior model-free methods on classic benchmark
games and scales to large domains such as Battleship and No-Limit Texas
Hold'em, where NashPG consistently attains higher Elo ratings.

TL;DR: 提出了ActivationReasoning框架，将显式逻辑推理嵌入到LLM的潜在空间中，通过三个步骤实现：发现潜在概念表示、激活命题、逻辑推理，从而提升模型的可解释性和可控性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM内部推理不透明且难以控制的问题，稀疏自编码器虽然能暴露潜在特征，但这些特征脆弱且被动，缺乏系统推理或模型控制机制。

Method: 三阶段框架：(1)发现潜在表示，通过SAE识别潜在概念并组织成字典；(2)激活命题，在推理时检测激活概念并映射到逻辑命题；(3)逻辑推理，应用逻辑规则推断高阶结构、组合新概念并引导模型行为。

Result: 在多个任务上评估（PrOntoQA、Rail2Country、ProverQA、BeaverTails），AR能够随推理复杂度稳健扩展，泛化到抽象和上下文敏感任务，并在不同模型骨干间迁移。

Conclusion: 将逻辑结构嵌入潜在激活不仅能提高透明度，还能实现结构化推理、可靠控制和与期望行为对齐，为更可靠和可审计的AI提供了路径。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at generating fluent text, but their
internal reasoning remains opaque and difficult to control. Sparse autoencoders
(SAEs) make hidden activations more interpretable by exposing latent features
that often align with human concepts. Yet, these features are fragile and
passive, offering no mechanism for systematic reasoning or model control. To
address this, we introduce ActivationReasoning (AR), a framework that embeds
explicit logical reasoning into the latent space of LLMs. It proceeds in three
stages: (1) Finding latent representations, first latent concept
representations are identified (e.g., via SAEs) and organized into a
dictionary; (2) Activating propositions, at inference time AR detects
activating concepts and maps them to logical propositions; and (3)Logical
reasoning, applying logical rules over these propositions to infer higher-order
structures, compose new concepts, and steer model behavior. We evaluate AR on
multi-hop reasoning (PrOntoQA), abstraction and robustness to indirect concept
cues (Rail2Country), reasoning over natural and diverse language (ProverQA),
and context-sensitive safety (BeaverTails). Across all tasks, AR scales
robustly with reasoning complexity, generalizes to abstract and
context-sensitive tasks, and transfers across model backbones. These results
demonstrate that grounding logical structure in latent activations not only
improves transparency but also enables structured reasoning, reliable control,
and alignment with desired behaviors, providing a path toward more reliable and
auditable AI.

Motivation: HJB方程在最优控制系统设计中具有重要价值，但数值求解计算量大，解析解通常不可得。物理信息神经网络等知识引导的机器学习方法为求解HJB方程提供了新途径。

Method: 采用多阶段集成框架，通过HJB方程学习最优成本函数和最优控制信号，不使用稳定项，支持单一控制信号或集成控制策略。

Conclusion: 该框架为求解HJB方程提供了一种有效的替代方法，能够在复杂非线性系统中实现稳定控制。

Abstract: The objective of designing a control system is to steer a dynamical system
with a control signal, guiding it to exhibit the desired behavior. The
Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) partial differential equation offers a framework
for optimal control system design. However, numerical solutions to this
equation are computationally intensive, and analytical solutions are frequently
unavailable. Knowledge-guided machine learning methodologies, such as
physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), offer new alternative approaches that
can alleviate the difficulties of solving the HJB equation numerically. This
work presents a multistage ensemble framework to learn the optimal cost-to-go,
and subsequently the corresponding optimal control signal, through the HJB
equation. Prior PINN-based approaches rely on a stabilizing the HJB enforcement
during training. Our framework does not use stabilizer terms and offers a means
of controlling the nonlinear system, via either a singular learned control
signal or an ensemble control signal policy. Success is demonstrated in
closed-loop control, using both ensemble- and singular-control, of a
steady-state time-invariant two-state continuous nonlinear system with an
infinite time horizon, accounting of noisy, perturbed system states and varying
initial conditions.

Abstract: This paper investigates underwater cooperative target detection using
autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), with a focus on the critical trade-off
between cooperation efficiency and communication covertness. To tackle this
challenge, we first formulate a joint trajectory and power control optimization
problem, and then present an innovative hierarchical action management
framework to solve it. According to the hierarchical formulation, at the macro
level, the master AUV models the agent selection process as a Markov decision
process and deploys the proximal policy optimization algorithm for strategic
task allocation. At the micro level, each selected agent's decentralized
decision-making is modeled as a partially observable Markov decision process,
and a multi-agent proximal policy optimization algorithm is used to dynamically
adjust its trajectory and transmission power based on its local observations.
Under the centralized training and decentralized execution paradigm, our target
detection framework enables adaptive covert cooperation while satisfying both
energy and mobility constraints. By comprehensively modeling the considered
system, the involved signals and tasks, as well as energy consumption,
theoretical insights and practical solutions for the efficient and secure
operation of multiple AUVs are provided, offering significant implications for
the execution of underwater covert communication tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有零阶优化方法存在梯度估计方差高的问题，导致收敛慢且性能欠佳，特别是在大规模模型上

Method: 首先估计低维梯度空间，然后在投影梯度方向上进行对齐扰动，减少扰动参数数量和方差

Result: 在分类任务上准确率提升达6%，生成任务上准确率提升达12%，训练迭代减少约81%，GPU时间减少70%

Conclusion: P-GAP实现了快速、可扩展且资源高效的零阶LLM微调

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) using zeroth-order (ZO) optimization
has emerged as a promising alternative to traditional gradient-based methods
due to its reduced memory footprint requirement. However, existing ZO methods
suffer from high variance in gradient estimation, leading to slow convergence
and suboptimal performance on large-scale models. In this work, we propose
P-GAP, a fast LLM fine-tuning approach through zeroth-order optimization with
Projected Gradient-Aligned Perturbations. Specifically, we first estimate a
low-dimensional gradient space and then align perturbations in projected
gradients' direction within the space. This approach enables reduced the number
of perturbed parameters and decreased variance, therefore accelerated
convergence for LLM fine-tuning. Experiments on LLMs show that P-GAP
consistently surpasses the baselines, achieving up to 6% increase in accuracy
on classification tasks and up to 12% higher accuracy on generation tasks, with
up to about 81% less training iterations and 70% less GPU hours. These results
demonstrate that P-GAP enables fast, scalable, and resource-efficient ZO LLM
fine-tuning.

Conclusion: ACTG-ARL框架有效解决了DP文本生成中的质量与控制问题，为隐私保护语言模型训练提供了新方案

Abstract: Generating high-quality synthetic text under differential privacy (DP) is
critical for training and evaluating language models without compromising user
privacy. Prior work on synthesizing DP datasets often fail to preserve key
statistical attributes, suffer utility loss from the noise required by DP, and
lack fine-grained control over generation. To address these challenges, we make
two contributions. First, we introduce a hierarchical framework that decomposes
DP synthetic text generation into two subtasks: feature learning and
conditional text generation. This design explicitly incorporates learned
features into the generation process and simplifies the end-to-end synthesis
task. Through systematic ablations, we identify the most effective
configuration: a rich tabular schema as feature, a DP tabular synthesizer, and
a DP fine-tuned conditional generator, which we term ACTG
(Attribute-Conditioned Text Generation). Second, we propose Anchored RL (ARL),
a post-training method that improves the instruction-following ability of ACTG
for conditional generation. ARL combines RL to boost control with an SFT anchor
on best-of-$N$ data to prevent reward hacking. Together, these components form
our end-to-end algorithm ACTG-ARL, which advances both the quality of DP
synthetic text (+20% MAUVE over prior work) and the control of the conditional
generator under strong privacy guarantees.

Motivation: 当前AI/ML社会影响力研究的评审标准倾向于同时认可部署和新方法创新，但这种双重标准可能削弱更广泛社会影响力研究生态系统的可持续性，因为许多项目可能更适合专注于应用或方法单方面的贡献。

Method: 采用立场论文的形式，通过论证分析当前评审标准的问题，并提出两个关键建议：扩展社会影响的概念定义，以及对部署系统进行更严格的影响评估。

Result: 识别了当前评审标准可能带来的不当激励，这些激励可能阻碍研究人员根据项目合作伙伴需求做出最适合的贡献选择。

Conclusion: 建议机器学习社会影响力领域的研究人员和评审者应采用更广泛的社会影响概念，并对部署系统进行更严格的影响评估，以支持更可持续的研究生态系统。

Abstract: There has been increasing research interest in AI/ML for social impact, and
correspondingly more publication venues have refined review criteria for
practice-driven AI/ML research. However, these review guidelines tend to most
concretely recognize projects that simultaneously achieve deployment and novel
ML methodological innovation. We argue that this introduces incentives for
researchers that undermine the sustainability of a broader research ecosystem
of social impact, which benefits from projects that make contributions on
single front (applied or methodological) that may better meet project partner
needs. Our position is that researchers and reviewers in machine learning for
social impact must simultaneously adopt: 1) a more expansive conception of
social impacts beyond deployment and 2) more rigorous evaluations of the impact
of deployed systems.

Result: 在五个基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，RULE在双层级噪声对应问题下优于七种最先进方法。

Conclusion: RULE框架有效解决了多模态实体对齐中的双层级噪声对应问题，通过可靠性估计和对应推理显著提升了噪声环境下的对齐性能。

Abstract: Multi-modal entity alignment (MMEA) aims to identify equivalent entities
across heterogeneous multi-modal knowledge graphs (MMKGs), where each entity is
described by attributes from various modalities. Existing methods typically
assume that both intra-entity and inter-graph correspondences are faultless,
which is often violated in real-world MMKGs due to the reliance on expert
annotations. In this paper, we reveal and study a highly practical yet
under-explored problem in MMEA, termed Dual-level Noisy Correspondence (DNC).
DNC refers to misalignments in both intra-entity (entity-attribute) and
inter-graph (entity-entity and attribute-attribute) correspondences. To address
the DNC problem, we propose a robust MMEA framework termed RULE. RULE first
estimates the reliability of both intra-entity and inter-graph correspondences
via a dedicated two-fold principle. Leveraging the estimated reliabilities,
RULE mitigates the negative impact of intra-entity noise during attribute
fusion and prevents overfitting to noisy inter-graph correspondences during
inter-graph discrepancy elimination. Beyond the training-time designs, RULE
further incorporates a correspondence reasoning module that uncovers the
underlying attribute-attribute connection across graphs, guaranteeing more
accurate equivalent entity identification. Extensive experiments on five
benchmarks verify the effectiveness of our method against the DNC compared with
seven state-of-the-art methods.The code is available at

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种条件缩放定律，通过优化隐藏层大小、MLP与注意力参数分配比例以及分组查询注意力等架构因素，在保持模型准确性的同时显著提升推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型参数规模和训练数据量的不断增长，推理成本已成为重要问题。模型准确性与推理效率之间的权衡关系尚未得到充分研究，需要探索如何通过架构优化来平衡这两者。

Method: 引入条件缩放定律，在Chinchilla框架基础上加入架构信息；开发搜索框架来识别同时具备高推理效率和准确性的架构；训练超过200个模型（参数范围80M-3B，训练token数8B-100B）来拟合提出的缩放定律。

Result: 条件缩放定律能可靠预测最优架构选择；优化后的模型在相同训练预算下，相比LLaMA-3.2准确率提升高达2.1%，推理吞吐量提升42%。

Conclusion: 通过系统性的架构优化可以有效平衡模型准确性与推理效率，提出的条件缩放定律为构建高效且准确的大语言模型提供了有效指导。

Abstract: Scaling the number of parameters and the size of training data has proven to
be an effective strategy for improving large language model (LLM) performance.
Yet, as these models grow increasingly powerful and widely deployed, the cost
of inference has become a pressing concern. Despite its importance, the
trade-off between model accuracy and inference efficiency remains
underexplored. In this work, we examine how key architectural factors, hidden
size, the allocation of parameters between MLP and attention (mlp-to-attention
ratio), and grouped-query attention (GQA), influence both inference cost and
accuracy. We introduce a conditional scaling law that augments the Chinchilla
framework with architectural information, along with a search framework for
identifying architectures that are simultaneously inference-efficient and
accurate. To validate our approach, we train more than 200 models spanning 80M
to 3B parameters and 8B to 100B training tokens, and fit the proposed
conditional scaling law. Our results show that the conditional scaling law
reliably predicts optimal architectural choices and that the resulting models
outperform existing open-source baselines. Under the same training budget,
optimized architectures achieve up to 2.1% higher accuracy and 42% greater
inference throughput compared to LLaMA-3.2.

Conclusion: 基于NTK理论的方法能有效缓解MTL中的任务不平衡问题，在保持竞争力的同时提升训练效率。

Abstract: Multi-Task Learning (MTL) enables a single model to learn multiple tasks
simultaneously, leveraging knowledge transfer among tasks for enhanced
generalization, and has been widely applied across various domains. However,
task imbalance remains a major challenge in MTL. Although balancing the
convergence speeds of different tasks is an effective approach to address this
issue, it is highly challenging to accurately characterize the training
dynamics and convergence speeds of multiple tasks within the complex MTL
system. To this end, we attempt to analyze the training dynamics in MTL by
leveraging Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) theory and propose a new MTL method,
NTKMTL. Specifically, we introduce an extended NTK matrix for MTL and adopt
spectral analysis to balance the convergence speeds of multiple tasks, thereby
mitigating task imbalance. Based on the approximation via shared
representation, we further propose NTKMTL-SR, achieving training efficiency
while maintaining competitive performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our methods achieve state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of
benchmarks, including both multi-task supervised learning and multi-task
reinforcement learning. Source code is available at

Motivation: 解决在线强化学习在图像生成中应用时，简单的线性奖励聚合会导致竞争性退化问题，因为静态权重会引起冲突的梯度信号，并且与扩散过程的时间动态不匹配

Method: Customized-GRPO框架包含两个关键创新：1) Synergy-Aware Reward Shaping - 非线性机制，显式惩罚冲突奖励信号并放大协同信号；2) Time-Aware Dynamic Weighting - 根据模型时间动态调整优化压力，早期优先提示遵循，后期优先身份保持

Conclusion: 提出的Customized-GRPO框架能够实现身份保真度和提示遵循度之间的优越平衡，生成既保持身份特征又准确遵循复杂提示的图像

Abstract: Subject-driven image generation models face a fundamental trade-off between
identity preservation (fidelity) and prompt adherence (editability). While
online reinforcement learning (RL), specifically GPRO, offers a promising
solution, we find that a naive application of GRPO leads to competitive
degradation, as the simple linear aggregation of rewards with static weights
causes conflicting gradient signals and a misalignment with the temporal
dynamics of the diffusion process. To overcome these limitations, we propose
Customized-GRPO, a novel framework featuring two key innovations: (i)
Synergy-Aware Reward Shaping (SARS), a non-linear mechanism that explicitly
penalizes conflicted reward signals and amplifies synergistic ones, providing a
sharper and more decisive gradient. (ii) Time-Aware Dynamic Weighting (TDW),
which aligns the optimization pressure with the model's temporal dynamics by
prioritizing prompt-following in the early, identity preservation in the later.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms
naive GRPO baselines, successfully mitigating competitive degradation. Our
model achieves a superior balance, generating images that both preserve key
identity features and accurately adhere to complex textual prompts.

Conclusion: 提出的TOT框架能够有效处理在线时间序列预测中的分布漂移问题，在真实世界应用中具有显著效果。

Abstract: This paper is concerned with online time series forecasting, where unknown
distribution shifts occur over time, i.e., latent variables influence the
mapping from historical to future observations. To develop an automated way of
online time series forecasting, we propose a Theoretical framework for Online
Time-series forecasting (TOT in short) with theoretical guarantees.
Specifically, we prove that supplying a forecaster with latent variables
tightens the Bayes risk, the benefit endures under estimation uncertainty of
latent variables and grows as the latent variables achieve a more precise
identifiability. To better introduce latent variables into online forecasting
algorithms, we further propose to identify latent variables with minimal
adjacent observations. Based on these results, we devise a model-agnostic
blueprint by employing a temporal decoder to match the distribution of observed
variables and two independent noise estimators to model the causal inference of
latent variables and mixing procedures of observed variables, respectively.
Experiment results on synthetic data support our theoretical claims. Moreover,
plug-in implementations built on several baselines yield general improvement
across multiple benchmarks, highlighting the effectiveness in real-world
applications.

Conclusion: 所提算法具有通用性和鲁棒性，能够有效解决毫米波通信中的波束对准和跟踪问题。

Abstract: In millimeter wave (mmWave) communications, beam alignment and tracking are
crucial to combat the significant path loss. As scanning the entire directional
space is inefficient, designing an efficient and robust method to identify the
optimal beam directions is essential. Since traditional bandit algorithms
require a long time horizon to converge under large beam spaces, many existing
works propose efficient bandit algorithms for beam alignment by relying on
unimodality or multimodality assumptions on the reward function's structure.
However, such assumptions often do not hold (or cannot be strictly satisfied)
in practice, which causes such algorithms to converge to choosing suboptimal
beams.
  In this work, we propose two physics-informed bandit algorithms
\textit{pretc} and \textit{prgreedy} that exploit the sparse multipath property
of mmWave channels - a generic but realistic assumption - which is connected to
the Phase Retrieval Bandit problem. Our algorithms treat the parameters of each
path as black boxes and maintain optimal estimates of them based on sampled
historical rewards. \textit{pretc} starts with a random exploration phase and
then commits to the optimal beam under the estimated reward function.
\textit{prgreedy} performs such estimation in an online manner and chooses the
best beam under current estimates. Our algorithms can also be easily adapted to
beam tracking in the mobile setting. Through experiments using both the
synthetic DeepMIMO dataset and the real-world DeepSense6G dataset, we
demonstrate that both algorithms outperform existing approaches in a wide range
of scenarios across diverse channel environments, showing their
generalizability and robustness.

Conclusion: CHiLD框架能够唯一识别分层潜在动态，为时间序列数据中的多层次抽象依赖关系建模提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Modeling hierarchical latent dynamics behind time series data is critical for
capturing temporal dependencies across multiple levels of abstraction in
real-world tasks. However, existing temporal causal representation learning
methods fail to capture such dynamics, as they fail to recover the joint
distribution of hierarchical latent variables from \textit{single-timestep
observed variables}. Interestingly, we find that the joint distribution of
hierarchical latent variables can be uniquely determined using three
conditionally independent observations. Building on this insight, we propose a
Causally Hierarchical Latent Dynamic (CHiLD) identification framework. Our
approach first employs temporal contextual observed variables to identify the
joint distribution of multi-layer latent variables. Sequentially, we exploit
the natural sparsity of the hierarchical structure among latent variables to
identify latent variables within each layer. Guided by the theoretical results,
we develop a time series generative model grounded in variational inference.
This model incorporates a contextual encoder to reconstruct multi-layer latent
variables and normalize flow-based hierarchical prior networks to impose the
independent noise condition of hierarchical latent dynamics. Empirical
evaluations on both synthetic and real-world datasets validate our theoretical
claims and demonstrate the effectiveness of CHiLD in modeling hierarchical
latent dynamics.

Motivation: 探究transformer在算法任务中如何构建内部世界模型，以及模型大小对表示质量的影响。

Method: 使用强化学习训练transformer执行冒泡排序式的相邻交换操作，通过数百次实验分析不同嵌入维度下的内部表示机制。

Result: 发现两个一致机制：注意力权重矩阵的最后一行单调编码token的全局排序；选择的交换操作与这些编码值的最大相邻差异对齐。高嵌入维度强化了结构化内部表示的形成。

Conclusion: transformer确实构建了结构化的内部世界模型，模型大小不仅提升最终性能，还改善了表示质量。

Abstract: We investigate how embedding dimension affects the emergence of an internal
"world model" in a transformer trained with reinforcement learning to perform
bubble-sort-style adjacent swaps. Models achieve high accuracy even with very
small embedding dimensions, but larger dimensions yield more faithful,
consistent, and robust internal representations. In particular, higher
embedding dimensions strengthen the formation of structured internal
representation and lead to better interpretability. After hundreds of
experiments, we observe two consistent mechanisms: (1) the last row of the
attention weight matrix monotonically encodes the global ordering of tokens;
and (2) the selected transposition aligns with the largest adjacent difference
of these encoded values. Our results provide quantitative evidence that
transformers build structured internal world models and that model size
improves representation quality in addition to end performance. We release our
metrics and analyses, which can be used to probe similar algorithmic tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统证据深度学习（EDL）使用Dirichlet分布建模不确定性，但其限制性假设在复杂或意外情况下限制了鲁棒性。需要一种更灵活的不确定性量化方法。

Method: 扩展EDL方法，预测灵活Dirichlet分布（Dirichlet分布的泛化）来建模类别概率，提供更具表达力和自适应性的不确定性表示。

Conclusion: F-EDL通过灵活Dirichlet分布扩展传统EDL，为不确定性量化提供了更强大和通用的解决方案，在挑战性场景中表现出色。

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification (UQ) is crucial for deploying machine learning
models in high-stakes applications, where overconfident predictions can lead to
serious consequences. An effective UQ method must balance computational
efficiency with the ability to generalize across diverse scenarios. Evidential
deep learning (EDL) achieves efficiency by modeling uncertainty through the
prediction of a Dirichlet distribution over class probabilities. However, the
restrictive assumption of Dirichlet-distributed class probabilities limits
EDL's robustness, particularly in complex or unforeseen situations. To address
this, we propose \textit{flexible evidential deep learning}
($\mathcal{F}$-EDL), which extends EDL by predicting a flexible Dirichlet
distribution -- a generalization of the Dirichlet distribution -- over class
probabilities. This approach provides a more expressive and adaptive
representation of uncertainty, significantly enhancing UQ generalization and
reliability under challenging scenarios. We theoretically establish several
advantages of $\mathcal{F}$-EDL and empirically demonstrate its
state-of-the-art UQ performance across diverse evaluation settings, including
classical, long-tailed, and noisy in-distribution scenarios.

TL;DR: TCCM是一种用于表格数据半监督异常检测的新方法，基于流匹配思想但简化了框架，通过预测时间条件收缩向量来实现轻量级训练和高效推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于扩散模型的异常检测方法（如DTE）虽然准确率高，但推理成本过高。TCCM旨在在保持高检测精度的同时显著降低推理成本。

Method: TCCM学习从数据分布到固定目标（原点）的时间条件收缩向量场，无需在训练和推理时求解常微分方程，使用单步偏差评分策略量化异常。

Result: 在ADBench基准测试中，TCCM在检测精度和推理成本之间取得了良好平衡，特别是在高维和大规模数据集上优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: TCCM提供了一种轻量级、可扩展且可解释的异常检测方法，在准确性和效率方面都表现出色，具有理论鲁棒性保证。

Abstract: We introduce Time-Conditioned Contraction Matching (TCCM), a novel method for
semi-supervised anomaly detection in tabular data. TCCM is inspired by flow
matching, a recent generative modeling framework that learns velocity fields
between probability distributions and has shown strong performance compared to
diffusion models and generative adversarial networks. Instead of directly
applying flow matching as originally formulated, TCCM builds on its core idea
-- learning velocity fields between distributions -- but simplifies the
framework by predicting a time-conditioned contraction vector toward a fixed
target (the origin) at each sampled time step. This design offers three key
advantages: (1) a lightweight and scalable training objective that removes the
need for solving ordinary differential equations during training and inference;
(2) an efficient scoring strategy called one time-step deviation, which
quantifies deviation from expected contraction behavior in a single forward
pass, addressing the inference bottleneck of existing continuous-time models
such as DTE (a diffusion-based model with leading anomaly detection accuracy
but heavy inference cost); and (3) explainability and provable robustness, as
the learned velocity field operates directly in input space, making the anomaly
score inherently feature-wise attributable; moreover, the score function is
Lipschitz-continuous with respect to the input, providing theoretical
guarantees under small perturbations. Extensive experiments on the ADBench
benchmark show that TCCM strikes a favorable balance between detection accuracy
and inference cost, outperforming state-of-the-art methods -- especially on
high-dimensional and large-scale datasets. The source code is available at our
GitHub repository.

*Jongmin Lee,Ernest K. Ryu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文分析了无折扣（γ=1）总奖励无限时域MDP中的策略梯度方法，通过引入瞬态访问测度替代经典状态访问测度，为基于策略的强化学习提供理论支持。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有策略梯度理论主要基于折扣因子γ<1的假设，而大型语言模型等实际应用使用无折扣总奖励设置（γ=1），导致现有理论不适用。

Method: 基于两个关键洞察：(1) MDP状态在严格正概率策略下的递归和瞬态分类不变性；(2) 用瞬态访问测度替代经典状态访问测度。

Result: 建立了无折扣总奖励设置下策略梯度方法的理论分析框架，解决了经典状态访问测度在γ=1时可能未定义的问题。

Conclusion: 为无折扣强化学习提供了理论基础，特别适用于使用softmax输出层的深度RL模型，填补了现有理论与实际应用之间的空白。

Abstract: The classical policy gradient method is the theoretical and conceptual
foundation of modern policy-based reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. Most
rigorous analyses of such methods, particularly those establishing convergence
guarantees, assume a discount factor $\gamma < 1$. In contrast, however, a
recent line of work on policy-based RL for large language models uses the
undiscounted total-reward setting with $\gamma = 1$, rendering much of the
existing theory inapplicable. In this paper, we provide analyses of the policy
gradient method for undiscounted expected total-reward infinite-horizon MDPs
based on two key insights: (i) the classification of the MDP states into
recurrent and transient states is invariant over the set of policies that
assign strictly positive probability to every action (as is typical in deep RL
models employing a softmax output layer) and (ii) the classical state
visitation measure (which may be ill-defined when $\gamma = 1$) can be replaced
with a new object that we call the transient visitation measure.

Motivation: 现有机器学习理论中的学习特征化往往将学习视为抽象数学对象，而忽略了学习能否作为计算机程序实现的关键问题。论文旨在解决通用在线学习模型中的可计算实现问题。

Method: 研究通用在线学习模型中的可计算性，分析当假设类在可计算性理论中相对简单时，通用在线学习是否意味着可计算通用在线学习。研究不可知论变体和适当变体的可计算学习特征。

Conclusion: 研究结果为在线二分类和相关归纳推理问题提供了更现实的视角，揭示了理论模型与实际可计算实现之间的差距。

Abstract: Understanding when learning is possible is a fundamental task in the theory
of machine learning. However, many characterizations known from the literature
deal with abstract learning as a mathematical object and ignore the crucial
question: when can learning be implemented as a computer program? We address
this question for universal online learning, a generalist theoretical model of
online binary classification, recently characterized by Bousquet et al.
(STOC'21). In this model, there is no hypothesis fixed in advance; instead,
Adversary -- playing the role of Nature -- can change their mind as long as
local consistency with the given class of hypotheses is maintained. We require
Learner to achieve a finite number of mistakes while using a strategy that can
be implemented as a computer program. We show that universal online learning
does not imply computable universal online learning, even if the class of
hypotheses is relatively easy from a computability-theoretic perspective. We
then study the agnostic variant of computable universal online learning and
provide an exact characterization of classes that are learnable in this sense.
We also consider a variant of proper universal online learning and show exactly
when it is possible. Together, our results give a more realistic perspective on
the existing theory of online binary classification and the related problem of
inductive inference.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep Ensembles等方法虽然不确定性量化性能强，但计算和内存成本高，难以扩展到大型模型。

Method: 基于Transformer的集成方法，剪枝注意力头创建多样化成员，通过新的多头注意力和分组全连接层合并成员，形成紧凑模型。

Result: 在图像和文本分类任务上持续优于Deep Ensembles，在ImageNet-1k零样本分类中超越现有方法，且无需额外训练。

Conclusion: Hydra Ensembles提供了一种高效的不确定性量化方法，在保持性能的同时显著降低计算成本。

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification (UQ) is essential for deploying deep neural
networks in safety-critical settings. Although methods like Deep Ensembles
achieve strong UQ performance, their high computational and memory costs hinder
scalability to large models. We introduce Hydra Ensembles, an efficient
transformer-based ensemble that prunes attention heads to create diverse
members and merges them via a new multi-head attention with grouped
fully-connected layers. This yields a compact model with inference speed close
to a single network, matching or surpassing Deep Ensembles in UQ performance
without retraining from scratch. We also provide an in-depth analysis of
pruning, showing that naive approaches can harm calibration, whereas Hydra
Ensembles preserves robust uncertainty. Experiments on image and text
classification tasks, with various architectures, show consistent gains over
Deep Ensembles. Remarkably, in zero-shot classification on ImageNet-1k, our
approach surpasses state of the art methods, even without requiring additional
training.

Conclusion: FGP方法能有效捕获神经网络架构的信息流，显著提升编码器性能，同时避免了复杂模型结构带来的速度问题。

Abstract: The performance of a deep learning model on a specific task and dataset
depends heavily on its neural architecture, motivating considerable efforts to
rapidly and accurately identify architectures suited to the target task and
dataset. To achieve this, researchers use machine learning models-typically
neural architecture encoders-to predict the performance of a neural
architecture. Many state-of-the-art encoders aim to capture information flow
within a neural architecture, which reflects how information moves through the
forward pass and backpropagation, via a specialized model structure. However,
due to their complicated structures, these flow-based encoders are
significantly slower to process neural architectures compared to simpler
encoders, presenting a notable practical challenge. To address this, we propose
FGP, a novel pre-training method for neural architecture encoding that trains
an encoder to capture the information flow without requiring specialized model
structures. FGP trains an encoder to reconstruct a flow surrogate, our proposed
representation of the neural architecture's information flow. Our experiments
show that FGP boosts encoder performance by up to 106% in Precision-1%,
compared to the same encoder trained solely with supervised learning.

<details>

Motivation: 现有图域自适应模型主要关注闭集设置，但现实场景中目标域可能包含源域中不存在的类别，需要识别未知类

Method: 通过修改目标图结构和节点特征进行图重编程，同时剪枝领域特定参数进行模型重编程，并扩展分类器维度以消除手动阈值设置

Result: 在多个公共数据集上的综合实验表明，所提模型相比现有最优基线取得了满意性能

Conclusion: GraphRTA框架能有效解决开放集图域自适应问题，在已知类和未知类识别方面表现良好

Abstract: Unsupervised Graph Domain Adaptation has become a promising paradigm for
transferring knowledge from a fully labeled source graph to an unlabeled target
graph. Existing graph domain adaptation models primarily focus on the
closed-set setting, where the source and target domains share the same label
spaces. However, this assumption might not be practical in the real-world
scenarios, as the target domain might include classes that are not present in
the source domain. In this paper, we investigate the problem of unsupervised
open-set graph domain adaptation, where the goal is to not only correctly
classify target nodes into the known classes, but also recognize previously
unseen node types into the unknown class. Towards this end, we propose a novel
framework called GraphRTA, which conducts reprogramming on both the graph and
model sides. Specifically, we reprogram the graph by modifying target graph
structure and node features, which facilitates better separation of known and
unknown classes. Meanwhile, we also perform model reprogramming by pruning
domain-specific parameters to reduce bias towards the source graph while
preserving parameters that capture transferable patterns across graphs.
Additionally, we extend the classifier with an extra dimension for the unknown
class, thus eliminating the need of manually specified threshold in open-set
recognition. Comprehensive experiments on several public datasets demonstrate
that our proposed model can achieve satisfied performance compared with recent
state-of-the-art baselines. Our source codes and datasets are publicly
available at https://github.com/cszhangzhen/GraphRTA.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become essential tools for learning on
relational data, yet the performance of a single GNN is often limited by the
heterogeneity present in real-world graphs. Recent advances in
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) frameworks demonstrate that assembling multiple,
explicitly diverse GNNs with distinct generalization patterns can significantly
improve performance. In this work, we present the first systematic empirical
study of expert-level diversification techniques for GNN ensembles. Evaluating
20 diversification strategies -- including random re-initialization,
hyperparameter tuning, architectural variation, directionality modeling, and
training data partitioning -- across 14 node classification benchmarks, we
construct and analyze over 200 ensemble variants. Our comprehensive evaluation
examines each technique in terms of expert diversity, complementarity, and
ensemble performance. We also uncovers mechanistic insights into training
maximally diverse experts. These findings provide actionable guidance for
expert training and the design of effective MoE frameworks on graph data. Our

We examine the approximation rates of ReLU$^{k}$ activation functions, proving
that the optimal rate cannot be achieved under $\ell^{1}$-bounded coefficients
or insufficient smoothness conditions.
  We also establish optimal approximation rates in various norms for functions
in Barron spaces and Sobolev spaces, confirming the curse of dimensionality.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对N元组中恰好有M个正例的弱监督学习设置，通过连接元组生成过程与潜在实例边际，开发了可训练的无偏风险估计器，在多个基准测试中优于代表性弱监督基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 弱监督学习通常使用粗粒度的聚合信号而非实例标签，研究每个训练示例是包含恰好m个正例的n元组，而仅观察到每个元组的计数m的情况，这种NTMP监督出现在图像分类和多重实例测量等场景中。

Method: 通过将元组生成过程与潜在实例边际联系起来，推导出闭式无偏风险估计器，并将其扩展到可变元组大小、可变计数及其组合，引入简单的ReLU校正来改善有限样本稳定性。

Result: 在转换为NTMP任务的基准测试中，该方法始终优于代表性弱监督基线，产生有利的精确率-召回率和F1权衡，在类别先验不平衡和不同元组配置下保持稳健。

Conclusion: 仅通过计数监督可以通过理论上有基础且实际稳定的目标有效利用，证明了计数监督在弱监督学习中的有效性。

Abstract: Weakly supervised learning often operates with coarse aggregate signals
rather than instance labels. We study a setting where each training example is
an $n$-tuple containing exactly m positives, while only the count m per tuple
is observed. This NTMP (N-tuple with M positives) supervision arises in, e.g.,
image classification with region proposals and multi-instance measurements. We
show that tuple counts admit a trainable unbiased risk estimator (URE) by
linking the tuple-generation process to latent instance marginals. Starting
from fixed (n,m), we derive a closed-form URE and extend it to variable tuple
sizes, variable counts, and their combination. Identification holds whenever
the effective mixing rate is separated from the class prior. We establish
generalization bounds via Rademacher complexity and prove statistical
consistency with standard rates under mild regularity assumptions. To improve
finite-sample stability, we introduce simple ReLU corrections to the URE that
preserve asymptotic correctness. Across benchmarks converted to NTMP tasks, the
approach consistently outperforms representative weak-supervision baselines and
yields favorable precision-recall and F1 trade-offs. It remains robust under
class-prior imbalance and across diverse tuple configurations, demonstrating
that count-only supervision can be exploited effectively through a
theoretically grounded and practically stable objective.

Result: 在MNIST和CIFAR-10上分别达到99.52%和90.63%的测试准确率，比基线方法提升1-2%，泛化差距分别为0.48%和7.14%。

Conclusion: MAGDrop为增强DNN泛化提供了理论和实践框架，适用于高风险应用场景。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) achieve remarkable performance but often suffer
from overfitting due to their high capacity. We introduce Momentum-Adaptive
Gradient Dropout (MAGDrop), a novel regularization method that dynamically
adjusts dropout rates on activations based on current gradients and accumulated
momentum, enhancing stability in non-convex optimization landscapes. To
theoretically justify MAGDrop's effectiveness, we derive a tightened PAC-Bayes
generalization bound that accounts for its adaptive nature, achieving up to 20%
sharper bounds compared to standard approaches by leveraging momentum-driven
perturbation control. Empirically, the activation-based MAGDrop outperforms
baseline regularization techniques, including standard dropout and adaptive
gradient regularization, by 1-2% in test accuracy on MNIST (99.52%) and
CIFAR-10 (90.63%), with generalization gaps of 0.48% and 7.14%, respectively.
Our work bridges theoretical insights and practical advancements, offering a
robust framework for enhancing DNN generalization suitable for high-stakes
applications.

Conclusion: CMT框架通过约束KL散度和熵衰减，显著改善了高维多模态分布采样性能，为物理系统和机器学习中的采样问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Efficient sampling from high-dimensional and multimodal unnormalized
probability distributions is a central challenge in many areas of science and
machine learning. We focus on Boltzmann generators (BGs) that aim to sample the
Boltzmann distribution of physical systems, such as molecules, at a given
temperature. Classical variational approaches that minimize the reverse
Kullback-Leibler divergence are prone to mode collapse, while annealing-based
methods, commonly using geometric schedules, can suffer from mass teleportation
and rely heavily on schedule tuning. We introduce Constrained Mass Transport
(CMT), a variational framework that generates intermediate distributions under
constraints on both the KL divergence and the entropy decay between successive
steps. These constraints enhance distributional overlap, mitigate mass
teleportation, and counteract premature convergence. Across standard BG
benchmarks and the here introduced ELIL tetrapeptide, the largest system
studied to date without access to samples from molecular dynamics, CMT
consistently surpasses state-of-the-art variational methods, achieving more
than 2.5x higher effective sample size while avoiding mode collapse.

Conclusion: SE-HTGNN通过创新的时空整合学习范式和LLM增强，为异质时序图学习提供了一种既高效又准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Heterogeneous temporal graphs (HTGs) are ubiquitous data structures in the
real world. Recently, to enhance representation learning on HTGs, numerous
attention-based neural networks have been proposed. Despite these successes,
existing methods rely on a decoupled temporal and spatial learning paradigm,
which weakens interactions of spatio-temporal information and leads to a high
model complexity. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel learning paradigm for
HTGs called Simple and Efficient Heterogeneous Temporal Graph N}eural Network
(SE-HTGNN). Specifically, we innovatively integrate temporal modeling into
spatial learning via a novel dynamic attention mechanism, which retains
attention information from historical graph snapshots to guide subsequent
attention computation, thereby improving the overall discriminative
representations learning of HTGs. Additionally, to comprehensively and
adaptively understand HTGs, we leverage large language models to prompt
SE-HTGNN, enabling the model to capture the implicit properties of node types
as prior knowledge. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SE-HTGNN achieves up
to 10x speed-up over the state-of-the-art and latest baseline while maintaining
the best forecasting accuracy.

Conclusion: 知识图谱在公平感知GNN研究中表现出独特特征，需要专门考虑GNN架构和训练策略来平衡准确性与公平性。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are powerful tools for learning from
graph-structured data but often produce biased predictions with respect to
sensitive attributes. Fairness-aware GNNs have been actively studied for
mitigating biased predictions. However, no prior studies have evaluated
fairness-aware GNNs on knowledge graphs, which are one of the most important
graphs in many applications, such as recommender systems. Therefore, we
introduce a benchmarking study on knowledge graphs. We generate new graphs from
three knowledge graphs, YAGO, DBpedia, and Wikidata, that are significantly
larger than the existing graph datasets used in fairness studies. We benchmark
inprocessing and preprocessing methods in different GNN backbones and early
stopping conditions. We find several key insights: (i) knowledge graphs show
different trends from existing datasets; clearer trade-offs between prediction
accuracy and fairness metrics than other graphs in fairness-aware GNNs, (ii)
the performance is largely affected by not only fairness-aware GNN methods but
also GNN backbones and early stopping conditions, and (iii) preprocessing
methods often improve fairness metrics, while inprocessing methods improve
prediction accuracy.

Conclusion: USC打破了安全与性能之间的普遍权衡，为可扩展的安全强化学习铺平了道路。

Abstract: Ensuring the safe exploration of reinforcement learning (RL) agents is
critical for deployment in real-world systems. Yet existing approaches struggle
to strike the right balance: methods that tightly enforce safety often cripple
task performance, while those that prioritize reward leave safety constraints
frequently violated, producing diffuse cost landscapes that flatten gradients
and stall policy improvement. We introduce the Uncertain Safety Critic (USC), a
novel approach that integrates uncertainty-aware modulation and refinement into
critic training. By concentrating conservatism in uncertain and costly regions
while preserving sharp gradients in safe areas, USC enables policies to achieve
effective reward-safety trade-offs. Extensive experiments show that USC reduces
safety violations by approximately 40% while maintaining competitive or higher
rewards, and reduces the error between predicted and true cost gradients by
approximately 83%, breaking the prevailing trade-off between safety and
performance and paving the way for scalable safe RL.

Motivation: 在安全关键环境中，可靠的导航需要准确的危险感知和原则性的不确定性处理，以增强下游安全处理。现有方法假设完美的危险检测能力，而不确定性感知方法缺乏有限样本保证。

Method: 将分布无关的有限样本安全保证整合到语义分割中，生成具有严格漏检边界的校准危险地图，这些地图为下游RL规划诱导风险感知成本场。

Result: 在两个卫星衍生基准测试中，COPPOL相比基线方法将危险覆盖率提高了6倍，实现了对不安全区域的近乎完全检测，同时将导航过程中的危险违规减少了约50%。

Conclusion: 该方法对分布偏移保持鲁棒性，同时保持了安全性和效率。

Abstract: Reliable navigation in safety-critical environments requires both accurate
hazard perception and principled uncertainty handling to strengthen downstream
safety handling. Despite the effectiveness of existing approaches, they assume
perfect hazard detection capabilities, while uncertainty-aware perception
approaches lack finite-sample guarantees. We present COPPOL, a conformal-driven
perception-to-policy learning approach that integrates distribution-free,
finite-sample safety guarantees into semantic segmentation, yielding calibrated
hazard maps with rigorous bounds for missed detections. These maps induce
risk-aware cost fields for downstream RL planning. Across two satellite-derived
benchmarks, COPPOL increases hazard coverage (up to 6x) compared to comparative
baselines, achieving near-complete detection of unsafe regions while reducing
hazardous violations during navigation (up to approx 50%). More importantly,
our approach remains robust to distributional shift, preserving both safety and
efficiency.

### [193] [Partial VOROS: A Cost-aware Performance Metric for Binary Classifiers with Precision and Capacity Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18520)
*Christopher Ratigan,Kyle Heuton,Carissa Wang,Lenore Cowen,Michael C. Hughes*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新的ROC分析方法，用于医院患者监测等应用场景，考虑了精度约束、容量限制和不对称成本因素，定义了部分VOROS指标来更好地评估分类器性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统ROC分析无法捕捉医院警报系统部署中的关键因素，如最小精度约束（避免误报疲劳）、预测阳性数量上限（医院人员容量限制）以及假阳性和假阴性的不对称成本。

Method: 展示了满足精度和容量约束的分类器子集如何在ROC空间中表示为可行区域，建立了该区域的几何结构，定义了部分较差分类器面积这一性能指标，并通过对成本参数范围求平均得到部分VOROS指标。

Result: 在MIMIC-IV数据集上使用生命体征历史预测死亡风险的实验中，证明这种成本感知指标在医院警报应用中比替代方法更能有效对分类器进行排序。

Conclusion: 提出的部分VOROS方法能够更好地评估医院警报系统等应用中的分类器性能，考虑了实际部署中的约束条件和成本不对称性。

Abstract: The ROC curve is widely used to assess binary classification performance. Yet
for some applications such as alert systems for hospitalized patient
monitoring, conventional ROC analysis cannot capture crucial factors that
impact deployment, such as enforcing a minimum precision constraint to avoid
false alarm fatigue or imposing an upper bound on the number of predicted
positives to represent the capacity of hospital staff. The usual area under the
curve metric also does not reflect asymmetric costs for false positives and
false negatives. In this paper we address all three of these issues. First, we
show how the subset of classifiers that meet given precision and capacity
constraints can be represented as a feasible region in ROC space. We establish
the geometry of this feasible region. We then define the partial area of lesser
classifiers, a performance metric that is monotonic with cost and only accounts
for the feasible portion of ROC space. Averaging this area over a desired range
of cost parameters results in the partial volume over the ROC surface, or
partial VOROS. In experiments predicting mortality risk using vital sign
history on the MIMIC-IV dataset, we show this cost-aware metric is better than
alternatives for ranking classifiers in hospital alert applications.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于教师模型可能来自不可信方，知识蒸馏可能带来意外的安全风险，特别是后门攻击的转移问题。

Method: 提出T-MTB后门技术，构建由多个特定令牌组成的复合后门触发器，这些令牌在预期蒸馏数据集中经常单独出现，使后门能够转移到学生模型。

Result: 使用T-MTB在两个攻击场景（越狱和内容调制）和四个LLM模型家族中展示了可转移后门的安全风险。

Conclusion: 知识蒸馏存在被低估的安全风险，T-MTB技术能够有效构建可转移的后门，需要引起对蒸馏安全性的重视。

Abstract: LLMs are often used by downstream users as teacher models for knowledge
distillation, compressing their capabilities into memory-efficient models.
However, as these teacher models may stem from untrusted parties, distillation
can raise unexpected security risks. In this paper, we investigate the security
implications of knowledge distillation from backdoored teacher models. First,
we show that prior backdoors mostly do not transfer onto student models. Our
key insight is that this is because existing LLM backdooring methods choose
trigger tokens that rarely occur in usual contexts. We argue that this
underestimates the security risks of knowledge distillation and introduce a new
backdooring technique, T-MTB, that enables the construction and study of
transferable backdoors. T-MTB carefully constructs a composite backdoor
trigger, made up of several specific tokens that often occur individually in
anticipated distillation datasets. As such, the poisoned teacher remains
stealthy, while during distillation the individual presence of these tokens
provides enough signal for the backdoor to transfer onto the student. Using
T-MTB, we demonstrate and extensively study the security risks of transferable
backdoors across two attack scenarios, jailbreaking and content modulation, and
across four model families of LLMs.

TL;DR: RAISE框架为AI系统提供多维度评估，包括可解释性、公平性、鲁棒性和可持续性，并聚合为单一责任分数。研究发现不同模型在不同维度表现各异，需要权衡选择。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI系统进入高风险领域，评估需要超越预测准确性，扩展到可解释性、公平性、鲁棒性和可持续性等多维度。

Method: 提出RAISE统一评估框架，量化模型在四个维度的表现并聚合成综合责任分数，在金融、医疗和社会经济数据集上评估三种深度学习模型。

Result: MLP在可持续性和鲁棒性表现优异，Transformer在可解释性和公平性表现最好但环境成本极高，Tabular ResNet提供平衡表现。

Conclusion: 没有单一模型在所有责任标准上都占优，强调多维度评估对于负责任模型选择的必要性。

Abstract: As AI systems enter high-stakes domains, evaluation must extend beyond
predictive accuracy to include explainability, fairness, robustness, and
sustainability. We introduce RAISE (Responsible AI Scoring and Evaluation), a
unified framework that quantifies model performance across these four
dimensions and aggregates them into a single, holistic Responsibility Score. We
evaluated three deep learning models: a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), a Tabular
ResNet, and a Feature Tokenizer Transformer, on structured datasets from
finance, healthcare, and socioeconomics. Our findings reveal critical
trade-offs: the MLP demonstrated strong sustainability and robustness, the
Transformer excelled in explainability and fairness at a very high
environmental cost, and the Tabular ResNet offered a balanced profile. These
results underscore that no single model dominates across all responsibility
criteria, highlighting the necessity of multi-dimensional evaluation for
responsible model selection. Our implementation is available at:

Motivation: 传统特征选择方法容易陷入局部最优，在高维数据中难以捕捉复杂特征关系，需要改进现有算法的结果。

Method: 采用偏置初始化策略和比率引导变异机制的遗传算法，结合帕累托多目标优化，同时最大化预测准确性和特征互补性。

Result: 在18个基准数据集上的实验表明，HeFS能识别被忽视但有信息量的特征，在胃癌分类、药物毒性预测等领域优于现有方法。

Conclusion: HeFS框架能有效改进现有特征选择算法的结果，通过识别补充特征提升分类性能。

Abstract: Feature selection is a combinatorial optimization problem that is NP-hard.
Conventional approaches often employ heuristic or greedy strategies, which are
prone to premature convergence and may fail to capture subtle yet informative
features. This limitation becomes especially critical in high-dimensional
datasets, where complex and interdependent feature relationships prevail. We
introduce the HeFS (Helper-Enhanced Feature Selection) framework to refine
feature subsets produced by existing algorithms. HeFS systematically searches
the residual feature space to identify a Helper Set - features that complement
the original subset and improve classification performance. The approach
employs a biased initialization scheme and a ratio-guided mutation mechanism
within a genetic algorithm, coupled with Pareto-based multi-objective
optimization to jointly maximize predictive accuracy and feature
complementarity. Experiments on 18 benchmark datasets demonstrate that HeFS
consistently identifies overlooked yet informative features and achieves
superior performance over state-of-the-art methods, including in challenging
domains such as gastric cancer classification, drug toxicity prediction, and
computer science applications. The code and datasets are available at

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种改进图神经网络结构鲁棒性验证的新方法，通过使用高效的部分求解器替代传统强大的约束求解器，在多项式时间内实现更好的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图神经网络在对抗攻击检测方面面临挑战，现有技术主要依赖强大的约束求解器（如混合整数规划），但这些方法计算成本高。本文旨在开发更高效的鲁棒性验证方法。

Method: 使用高效的部分求解器替代传统强大的约束求解器，这些部分求解器运行在多项式时间内但可能不完整，从而在保持验证效果的同时显著提高效率。

Result: 在多种GNN变体和数据集上评估了RobLight工具，结果显示该方法在结构鲁棒性验证方面超越了现有技术水平。

Conclusion: 通过使用多项式时间的不完全求解器，可以在图神经网络的结构鲁棒性验证中实现比现有技术更好的性能，为对抗攻击检测提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are the predominant architecture for learning
over graphs. As with any machine learning model, and important issue is the
detection of adversarial attacks, where an adversary can change the output with
a small perturbation of the input. Techniques for solving the adversarial
robustness problem - determining whether such an attack exists - were
originally developed for image classification, but there are variants for many
other machine learning architectures. In the case of graph learning, the attack
model usually considers changes to the graph structure in addition to or
instead of the numerical features of the input, and the state of the art
techniques in the area proceed via reduction to constraint solving, working on
top of powerful solvers, e.g. for mixed integer programming. We show that it is
possible to improve on the state of the art in structural robustness by
replacing the use of powerful solvers by calls to efficient partial solvers,
which run in polynomial time but may be incomplete. We evaluate our tool
RobLight on a diverse set of GNN variants and datasets.

TL;DR: 提出Unrolled-SINDy方法，通过解卷方案改进PDE发现的稳定性，解决时间稀疏采样数据下的微分方程识别问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统SINDy方法在处理时间稀疏采样数据时存在局限性，无法解决局部截断误差导致的参数恢复问题

Method: 采用解卷方案将数值时间步长与数据采样率解耦，可通过迭代闭式方法或梯度下降方案实现

Result: 实验表明该方法具有通用性，在传统SINDy和先进的iNeuralSINDy上都能处理非解卷方法无法解决的问题

Conclusion: Unrolled-SINDy方法能够有效解决稀疏时间采样数据下的物理动力学微分方程识别问题

Abstract: Identifying from observation data the governing differential equations of a
physical dynamics is a key challenge in machine learning. Although approaches
based on SINDy have shown great promise in this area, they still fail to
address a whole class of real world problems where the data is sparsely sampled
in time. In this article, we introduce Unrolled-SINDy, a simple methodology
that leverages an unrolling scheme to improve the stability of explicit methods
for PDE discovery. By decorrelating the numerical time step size from the
sampling rate of the available data, our approach enables the recovery of
equation parameters that would not be the minimizers of the original SINDy
optimization problem due to large local truncation errors. Our method can be
exploited either through an iterative closed-form approach or by a gradient
descent scheme. Experiments show the versatility of our method. On both
traditional SINDy and state-of-the-art noise-robust iNeuralSINDy, with
different numerical schemes (Euler, RK4), our proposed unrolling scheme allows
to tackle problems not accessible to non-unrolled methods.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了在下一个符号预测(NSP)设置下语言的可学习性，该设置提供了比传统分类更丰富的标签信息，但证明了学习DFA和布尔公式等概念类仍然是计算困难的。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NSP设置已被用于实证分析神经序列模型，且该设置的高效算法可用于学习语言模型的(截断)支持。作者希望将这一设置形式化以进行PAC学习分析。

Method: 通过构造使几乎所有附加标签变得无信息，从而将传统学习问题归约到具有NSP标签的学习问题。

Result: 在密码学假设下，学习DFA在NSP设置下仍然是计算困难的。

Conclusion: 尽管NSP设置提供了更丰富的标签信息，但学习DFA和布尔公式等概念类的计算困难性依然存在。

Abstract: We study the learnability of languages in the Next Symbol Prediction (NSP)
setting, where a learner receives only positive examples from a language
together with, for every prefix, (i) whether the prefix itself is in the
language and (ii) which next symbols can lead to an accepting string. This
setting has been used in prior works to empirically analyze neural sequence
models, and additionally, we observe that efficient algorithms for the NSP
setting can be used to learn the (truncated) support of language models. We
formalize the setting so as to make it amenable to PAC-learning analysis. While
the setting provides a much richer set of labels than the conventional
classification setting, we show that learning concept classes such as DFAs and
Boolean formulas remains computationally hard. The proof is via a construction
that makes almost all additional labels uninformative, yielding a reduction
from the conventional learning problem to learning with NSP labels. Under
cryptographic assumptions, the reduction implies that the problem of learning
DFAs is computationally hard in the NSP setting.

Motivation: 现有理论研究主要关注线性回归任务，本文旨在理解Transformer如何建模动态驱动函数，特别是在马尔可夫函数学习中的上下文学习能力。

Method: 通过结构化上下文学习设置，分析损失景观以揭示底层优化行为，包括推导单层线性自注意力模型的全局最小化解闭式表达式，证明恢复最优解的NP难性，以及将多层模型解释为预条件梯度下降。

Result: 发现单层线性自注意力模型在表示结构化动态函数时存在基本限制，恢复最优解是NP难的；多层模型可以优化多个目标函数；理论结果通过简化Transformer得到数值验证。

Conclusion: Transformer在动态函数学习中的上下文学习能力受到结构限制，多层架构提供了更强大的优化能力，为理解Transformer的表示能力提供了新的理论视角。

Abstract: Transformer architectures can solve unseen tasks based on input-output pairs
in a given prompt due to in-context learning (ICL). Existing theoretical
studies on ICL have mainly focused on linear regression tasks, often with
i.i.d. inputs. To understand how transformers express ICL when modeling
dynamics-driven functions, we investigate Markovian function learning through a
structured ICL setup, where we characterize the loss landscape to reveal
underlying optimization behaviors. Specifically, we (1) provide the closed-form
expression of the global minimizer (in an enlarged parameter space) for a
single-layer linear self-attention (LSA) model; (2) prove that recovering
transformer parameters that realize the optimal solution is NP-hard in general,
revealing a fundamental limitation of one-layer LSA in representing structured
dynamical functions; and (3) supply a novel interpretation of a multilayer LSA
as performing preconditioned gradient descent to optimize multiple objectives
beyond the square loss. These theoretical results are numerically validated
using simplified transformers.

Conclusion: 该方法为行业、政策制定者和农民在气候变化背景下建设更具韧性的农业提供了决策支持，成功实现了物理一致性和预测精度的平衡。

Abstract: Water is essential for agricultural productivity. Assessing water shortages
and reduced yield potential is a critical factor in decision-making for
ensuring agricultural productivity and food security. Crop simulation models,
which align with physical processes, offer intrinsic explainability but often
perform poorly. Conversely, machine learning models for crop yield modeling are
powerful and scalable, yet they commonly operate as black boxes and lack
adherence to the physical principles of crop growth. This study bridges this
gap by coupling the advantages of both worlds. We postulate that the crop yield
is inherently defined by the water availability. Therefore, we formulate crop
yield as a function of temporal water scarcity and predict both the crop
drought stress and the sensitivity to water scarcity at fine-scale resolution.
Sequentially modeling the crop yield response to water enables accurate yield
prediction. To enforce physical consistency, a novel physics-informed loss
function is proposed. We leverage multispectral satellite imagery,
meteorological data, and fine-scale yield data. Further, to account for the
uncertainty within the model, we build upon a deep ensemble approach. Our
method surpasses state-of-the-art models like LSTM and Transformers in crop
yield prediction with a coefficient of determination ($R^2$-score) of up to
0.82 while offering high explainability. This method offers decision support
for industry, policymakers, and farmers in building a more resilient
agriculture in times of changing climate conditions.

Motivation: 现有对话动态模型难以跨群体泛化，且通用公式可能不适合所有群体，需要能基于个体特征预测轮转的模型。

Method: 开发了先前对话模型的泛化版本，基于个性特征和过往发言行为预测个体在群体中的发言轮次，能学习发言倾向随时间变化。

Conclusion: 该模型提供了跨群体泛化分析对话动态的能力，揭示了基于个体特征和发言历史的轮转模式，为群体互动研究提供了新视角。

Abstract: We propose a flexible probabilistic model for predicting turn-taking patterns
in group conversations based solely on individual characteristics and past
speaking behavior. Many models of conversation dynamics cannot yield insights
that generalize beyond a single group. Moreover, past works often aim to
characterize speaking behavior through a universal formulation that may not be
suitable for all groups. We thus develop a generalization of prior conversation
models that predicts speaking turns among individuals in any group based on
their individual characteristics, that is, personality traits, and prior
speaking behavior. Importantly, our approach provides the novel ability to
learn how speaking inclination varies based on when individuals last spoke. We
apply our model to synthetic and real-world conversation data to verify the
proposed approach and characterize real group interactions. Our results
demonstrate that previous behavioral models may not always be realistic,
motivating our data-driven yet theoretically grounded approach.

Abstract: The vast majority of cardiovascular diseases may be preventable if early
signs and risk factors are detected. Cardiovascular monitoring with body-worn
sensor devices like sensor patches allows for the detection of such signs while
preserving the freedom and comfort of patients. However, the analysis of the
sensor data must be robust, reliable, efficient, and highly accurate. Deep
learning methods can automate data interpretation, reducing the workload of
clinicians. In this work, we analyze the feasibility of applying deep learning
models to the classification of synchronized electrocardiogram (ECG) and
phonocardiogram (PCG) recordings on resource-constrained medical edge devices.
We propose a convolutional neural network with early fusion of data to solve a
binary classification problem. We train and validate our model on the
synchronized ECG and PCG recordings from the Physionet Challenge 2016 dataset.
Our approach reduces memory footprint and compute cost by three orders of
magnitude compared to the state-of-the-art while maintaining competitive
accuracy. We demonstrate the applicability of our proposed model on medical
edge devices by analyzing energy consumption on a microcontroller and an
experimental sensor device setup, confirming that on-device inference can be
more energy-efficient than continuous data streaming.

Motivation: 虽然RLLM在复杂推理任务中表现出色，但其服务性能和行为尚未被充分探索，这阻碍了RLLM在实际场景中的部署和应用。

Method: 首先进行试点研究比较RLLM与传统LLM的服务性能，然后调查现有推理优化技术对RLLM的有效性，最后在模拟真实工作负载的Gamma分布下进行评估。

Result: 发现RLLM具有显著的内存使用和波动、拖尾请求、自适应运行时间和领域偏好等独特行为。模型量化和推测解码可提高系统效率且对精度影响小，而前缀缓存和KV缓存量化可能降低小RLLM的精度或性能。

Conclusion: 研究为RLLM推理服务提供了重要见解，有助于推动RLLM在研究和工业界的应用部署。

Abstract: The reasoning large language model (RLLM) has been proven competitive in
solving complex reasoning tasks such as mathematics, coding, compared to
general LLM. However, the serving performance and behavior of RLLM remains
unexplored, which may undermine the deployment and utilization of RLLM in
real-world scenario. To close this gap, in this paper, we conduct a
comprehensive study of RLLM service. We first perform a pilot study on
comparing the serving performance between RLLM and traditional LLM and reveal
that there are several distinct differences regarding serving behavior: (1)
significant memory usage and fluctuations; (2) straggler requests; (3) adaptive
running time; (4) domain preference. Then we further investigate whether
existing inference optimization techniques are valid for RLLM. Our main
takeaways are that model quantization methods and speculative decoding can
improve service system efficiency with small compromise to RLLM accuracy, while
prefix caching, KV cache quantization may even degrade accuracy or serving
performance for small RLLM. Lastly, we conduct evaluation under real world
workload modeled by Gamma distribution to verify our findings. Empirical
results of real world workload evaluation across different dataset are aligned
with our main findings regarding RLLM serving. We hope our work can provide the
research community and industry with insights to advance RLLM inference
serving.

Abstract: Casting complex inputs into tractable representations is a critical step
across various fields. Diverse embedding models emerge from differences in
architectures, loss functions, input modalities and datasets, each capturing
unique aspects of the input. Multi-teacher distillation leverages this
diversity to enrich representations but often remains tailored to specific
tasks. In this paper, we introduce a task-agnostic framework based on a
``majority vote" objective function. We demonstrate that this function is
bounded by the mutual information between student and teachers' embeddings,
leading to a task-agnostic distillation loss that eliminates dependence on
task-specific labels or prior knowledge. Our evaluations across text, vision
models, and molecular modeling show that our method effectively leverages
teacher diversity, resulting in representations enabling better performance for
a wide range of downstream tasks such as classification, clustering, or
regression. Additionally, we train and release state-of-the-art embedding
models, enhancing downstream performance in various modalities.

TL;DR: 提出贝叶斯价值函数和BOLA算法，解决传统RL在多步预测场景下的维度灾难问题，证明即使在预测不完美时也能保持样本效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RL基于单步转移模型，但许多实际应用（如能源管理、股票投资）可以获取多步预测，这些预测能为决策提供额外优势。然而多步预测会导致状态空间指数爆炸和维度灾难，现有RL理论也难以分析包含预测误差的预测增强MDP

Method: 提出贝叶斯价值函数来刻画最优预测感知策略；开发Bellman-Jensen Gap分析来表征不完美预测的价值；引入BOLA算法，将离线贝叶斯价值学习与轻量级在线适应分离

Result: 证明了BOLA即使在预测不完美时也能保持样本效率；在合成MDP和真实世界风能存储控制问题上验证了理论和算法

Conclusion: 通过贝叶斯价值函数和BOLA算法，成功解决了多步预测RL中的维度灾难问题，为预测增强的决策提供了理论保证和实用算法

Abstract: Traditional reinforcement learning (RL) assumes the agents make decisions
based on Markov decision processes (MDPs) with one-step transition models. In
many real-world applications, such as energy management and stock investment,
agents can access multi-step predictions of future states, which provide
additional advantages for decision making. However, multi-step predictions are
inherently high-dimensional: naively embedding these predictions into an MDP
leads to an exponential blow-up in state space and the curse of dimensionality.
Moreover, existing RL theory provides few tools to analyze prediction-augmented
MDPs, as it typically works on one-step transition kernels and cannot
accommodate multi-step predictions with errors or partial action-coverage. We
address these challenges with three key innovations: First, we propose the
\emph{Bayesian value function} to characterize the optimal prediction-aware
policy tractably. Second, we develop a novel \emph{Bellman-Jensen Gap} analysis
on the Bayesian value function, which enables characterizing the value of
imperfect predictions. Third, we introduce BOLA (Bayesian Offline Learning with
Online Adaptation), a two-stage model-based RL algorithm that separates offline
Bayesian value learning from lightweight online adaptation to real-time
predictions. We prove that BOLA remains sample-efficient even under imperfect
predictions. We validate our theory and algorithm on synthetic MDPs and a
real-world wind energy storage control problem.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: OmniCast是一个统一多时间尺度天气预报的概率模型，通过VAE编码和扩散变换器生成未来潜在状态序列，避免了自回归方法的误差累积问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据驱动的深度学习方法在中期天气预报中表现良好，但在更长的次季节到季节(S2S)尺度上由于自回归方法的误差累积而表现不佳。

Method: OmniCast包含两个组件：VAE模型将原始天气数据编码到低维潜在空间，扩散变换器模型基于初始条件标记生成未来潜在标记序列。训练时随机掩码未来标记，推理时通过迭代解掩码生成完整序列。

Result: OmniCast在中期时间尺度上与领先概率方法竞争，同时快10-20倍；在S2S尺度上在准确性、物理基础和概率指标方面达到最先进性能；能生成长达100年的稳定预测。

Conclusion: OmniCast通过联合采样和低维潜在空间建模，成功统一了多时间尺度的天气预报，解决了自回归方法的误差累积问题，实现了从短期到长期的高效准确预测。

Abstract: Accurate weather forecasting across time scales is critical for anticipating
and mitigating the impacts of climate change. Recent data-driven methods based
on deep learning have achieved significant success in the medium range, but
struggle at longer subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) horizons due to error
accumulation in their autoregressive approach. In this work, we propose
OmniCast, a scalable and skillful probabilistic model that unifies weather
forecasting across timescales. OmniCast consists of two components: a VAE model
that encodes raw weather data into a continuous, lower-dimensional latent
space, and a diffusion-based transformer model that generates a sequence of
future latent tokens given the initial conditioning tokens. During training, we
mask random future tokens and train the transformer to estimate their
distribution given conditioning and visible tokens using a per-token diffusion
head. During inference, the transformer generates the full sequence of future
tokens by iteratively unmasking random subsets of tokens. This joint sampling
across space and time mitigates compounding errors from autoregressive
approaches. The low-dimensional latent space enables modeling long sequences of
future latent states, allowing the transformer to learn weather dynamics beyond
initial conditions. OmniCast performs competitively with leading probabilistic
methods at the medium-range timescale while being 10x to 20x faster, and
achieves state-of-the-art performance at the subseasonal-to-seasonal scale
across accuracy, physics-based, and probabilistic metrics. Furthermore, we
demonstrate that OmniCast can generate stable rollouts up to 100 years ahead.

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We study online preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL) with the goal
of improving sample efficiency. While a growing body of theoretical work has
emerged-motivated by PbRL's recent empirical success, particularly in aligning
large language models (LLMs)-most existing studies focus only on pairwise
comparisons. A few recent works (Zhu et al., 2023, Mukherjee et al., 2024,
Thekumparampil et al., 2024) have explored using multiple comparisons and
ranking feedback, but their performance guarantees fail to improve-and can even
deteriorate-as the feedback length increases, despite the richer information
available. To address this gap, we adopt the Plackett-Luce (PL) model for
ranking feedback over action subsets and propose M-AUPO, an algorithm that
selects multiple actions by maximizing the average uncertainty within the
offered subset. We prove that M-AUPO achieves a suboptimality gap of
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\left( \frac{d}{T} \sqrt{ \sum_{t=1}^T \frac{1}{|S_t|}}
\right)$, where $T$ is the total number of rounds, $d$ is the feature
dimension, and $|S_t|$ is the size of the subset at round $t$. This result
shows that larger subsets directly lead to improved performance and, notably,
the bound avoids the exponential dependence on the unknown parameter's norm,
which was a fundamental limitation in most previous works. Moreover, we
establish a near-matching lower bound of $\Omega \left( \frac{d}{K \sqrt{T}}
\right)$, where $K$ is the maximum subset size. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first theoretical result in PbRL with ranking feedback that
explicitly shows improved sample efficiency as a function of the subset size.

Motivation: 真实医疗数据因监管障碍难以获取，合成数据成为解决方案。现有生成方法未考虑下游因果推断任务（特别是治疗效应分析）的特殊挑战。

Method: 提出了STEAM方法，基于三个核心要求：保持协变量分布、治疗分配机制和结果生成机制。通过模拟包含治疗的数据生成过程来优化这些要求。

Conclusion: STEAM方法能够生成高质量合成数据，有效支持医疗领域的治疗效应分析，解决了现有方法未考虑因果推断特殊需求的局限性。

Abstract: Causal inference is essential for developing and evaluating medical
interventions, yet real-world medical datasets are often difficult to access
due to regulatory barriers. This makes synthetic data a potentially valuable
asset that enables these medical analyses, along with the development of new
inference methods themselves. Generative models can produce synthetic data that
closely approximate real data distributions, yet existing methods do not
consider the unique challenges that downstream causal inference tasks, and
specifically those focused on treatments, pose. We establish a set of
desiderata that synthetic data containing treatments should satisfy to maximise
downstream utility: preservation of (i) the covariate distribution, (ii) the
treatment assignment mechanism, and (iii) the outcome generation mechanism.
Based on these desiderata, we propose a set of evaluation metrics to assess
such synthetic data. Finally, we present STEAM: a novel method for generating
Synthetic data for Treatment Effect Analysis in Medicine that mimics the
data-generating process of data containing treatments and optimises for our
desiderata. We empirically demonstrate that STEAM achieves state-of-the-art
performance across our metrics as compared to existing generative models,
particularly as the complexity of the true data-generating process increases.

TL;DR: 提出L2O-CFGD方法，通过元学习动态调整Caputo分数梯度下降的超参数，解决了分数梯度下降在收敛行为和超参数选择方面的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分数梯度下降虽然能加速优化，但在收敛行为和超参数选择方面面临显著挑战，特别是在非凸设置中调度超参数尤其困难。

Method: 提出L2O-CFGD方法，元学习如何动态调整Caputo分数梯度下降的超参数，生成元学习调度策略。

Result: 元学习调度策略优于通过广泛搜索找到的静态超参数CFGD，在某些任务中性能可与完全黑盒元学习优化器相媲美。

Conclusion: L2O-CFGD可作为强大工具，帮助研究人员识别高性能超参数，并深入了解如何在优化中利用分数微积分的历史依赖性。

Abstract: Fractional Gradient Descent (FGD) offers a novel and promising way to
accelerate optimization by incorporating fractional calculus into machine
learning. Although FGD has shown encouraging initial results across various
optimization tasks, it faces significant challenges with convergence behavior
and hyperparameter selection. Moreover, the impact of its hyperparameters is
not fully understood, and scheduling them is particularly difficult in
non-convex settings such as neural network training. To address these issues,
we propose a novel approach called Learning to Optimize Caputo Fractional
Gradient Descent (L2O-CFGD), which meta-learns how to dynamically tune the
hyperparameters of Caputo FGD (CFGD). Our method's meta-learned schedule
outperforms CFGD with static hyperparameters found through an extensive search
and, in some tasks, achieves performance comparable to a fully black-box
meta-learned optimizer. L2O-CFGD can thus serve as a powerful tool for
researchers to identify high-performing hyperparameters and gain insights on
how to leverage the history-dependence of the fractional differential in
optimization.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CAGE是一种新的量化感知训练方法，通过曲率感知梯度估计来减少量化带来的精度损失，在W4A4量化下能恢复超过10%的损失增加。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的低比特量化感知训练与原生训练之间仍存在较大的精度差距，需要新的方法来弥补这一差距。

Method: CAGE通过增强直通估计器梯度，添加曲率感知校正项来抵消量化引起的损失增加，基于多目标优化视角平衡损失最小化和量化约束。

Result: 在预训练800M参数的Llama风格模型时，CAGE在W4A4量化下比异常值处理方法多恢复了超过10%的量化损失。

Conclusion: 曲率感知梯度校正能够超越当前异常值处理方法，弥合量化带来的性能差距。

Abstract: Despite significant work on low-bit quantization-aware training (QAT), there
is still a large accuracy gap between such techniques and native training. To
address this, we introduce CAGE (Curvature-Aware Gradient Estimation), a new
QAT method that augments the straight-through estimator (STE) gradient with a
curvature-aware correction designed to counteract the loss increase induced by
quantization. CAGE is derived from a multi-objective view of QAT that balances
loss minimization with adherence to quantization constraints, yielding a
principled correction term that depends on local curvature information. On the
theoretical side, we introduce the notion of Pareto-optimal solutions for
quantized optimization, and establish that CAGE yields strong convergence
guarantees in the smooth non-convex setting. In terms of implementation, our
approach is optimizer-agnostic, but we provide a highly-efficient
implementation that leverages Adam statistics. When pre-training Llama-style
models of up to 800M-parameters, CAGE recovers over 10% of the
quantization-induced loss increase in the W4A4 regime over outlier-mitigation
methods. These results indicate that curvature-aware gradient corrections can
bridge the remaining performance gap beyond current outlier-handling methods.

Motivation: 在线主题模型能处理持续演化的数据流，与真实场景更契合，但由于额外的挑战而受到较少关注。

Method: 扩展嵌入式主题模型(ETM)，使用截断stick-breaking构造处理文档-主题分布，引入基于连续最优传输的主题嵌入合并策略。

Conclusion: SB-SETM能有效处理数据流中的主题演化问题，自动推断活动主题数量，在真实世界应用中表现良好。

Abstract: Online topic models are unsupervised algorithms to identify latent topics in
data streams that continuously evolve over time. Although these methods
naturally align with real-world scenarios, they have received considerably less
attention from the community compared to their offline counterparts, due to
specific additional challenges. To tackle these issues, we present SB-SETM, an
innovative model extending the Embedded Topic Model (ETM) to process data
streams by merging models formed on successive partial document batches. To
this end, SB-SETM (i) leverages a truncated stick-breaking construction for the
topic-per-document distribution, enabling the model to automatically infer from
the data the appropriate number of active topics at each timestep; and (ii)
introduces a merging strategy for topic embeddings based on a continuous
formulation of optimal transport adapted to the high dimensionality of the
latent topic space. Numerical experiments show SB-SETM outperforming baselines
on simulated scenarios. We extensively test it on a real-world corpus of news
articles covering the Russian-Ukrainian war throughout 2022-2023.

TL;DR: 提出连续时间神经网络模型，统一多种生物学习算法，无需分离推理和学习阶段，揭示学习依赖于输入与误差信号的时间重叠，要求突触可塑性时间尺度超过刺激持续时间1-2个数量级。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物学习在连续时间中展开，但现有算法模型依赖离散更新和分离的推理学习阶段，需要开发更符合生物现实的连续时间学习模型。

Method: 构建连续时间神经网络模型，通过动态分析推导出SGD、FA、DFA、KP等学习规则作为特例，进行仿真验证在生物时间尺度下的稳定学习。

Result: 连续时间网络在生物时间尺度下稳定学习，学习强度随输入与误差信号时间延迟线性下降，突触可塑性时间尺度需超过刺激持续时间1-2个数量级。

Conclusion: 秒级资格迹是生物电路中误差驱动学习所必需的，这为理解生物学习机制提供了可验证的预测。

Abstract: Biological learning unfolds continuously in time, yet most algorithmic models
rely on discrete updates and separate inference and learning phases. We study a
continuous-time neural model that unifies several biologically plausible
learning algorithms and removes the need for phase separation. Rules including
stochastic gradient descent (SGD), feedback alignment (FA), direct feedback
alignment (DFA), and Kolen-Pollack (KP) emerge naturally as limiting cases of
the dynamics. Simulations show that these continuous-time networks stably learn
at biological timescales, even under temporal mismatches and integration noise.
Through analysis and simulation, we show that learning depends on temporal
overlap: a synapse updates correctly only when its input and the corresponding
error signal coincide in time. When inputs are held constant, learning strength
declines linearly as the delay between input and error approaches the stimulus
duration, explaining observed robustness and failure across network depths.
Critically, robust learning requires the synaptic plasticity timescale to
exceed the stimulus duration by one to two orders of magnitude. For typical
cortical stimuli (tens of milliseconds), this places the functional plasticity
window in the few-second range, a testable prediction that identifies
seconds-scale eligibility traces as necessary for error-driven learning in
biological circuits.

Motivation: 研究LRP在Transformer中的公理合理性，特别是其在现代Transformer架构中的有效性，以及如何更好地近似计算昂贵的LOO特征重要性度量。

Method: 通过理论分析和实验验证，检验AttnLRP中双线性传播规则的公理违反问题，并重新评估CP-LRP作为诊断基线，比较绕过softmax传播与标准LRP方法的差异。

Result: 双线性传播规则在注意力层中违反实现不变性公理；绕过softmax层、仅通过值矩阵传播相关性的CP-LRP方法在Transformer中后层与LOO对齐度显著提高。

Conclusion: 双线性分解敏感性和softmax传播误差共同削弱了LRP在Transformer中近似LOO的能力，需要重新考虑LRP在复杂架构中的设计原则。

Abstract: Leave-One-Out (LOO) provides an intuitive measure of feature importance but
is computationally prohibitive. While Layer-Wise Relevance Propagation (LRP)
offers a potentially efficient alternative, its axiomatic soundness in modern
Transformers remains largely under-examined. In this work, we first show that
the bilinear propagation rules used in recent advances of AttnLRP violate the
implementation invariance axiom. We prove this analytically and confirm it
empirically in linear attention layers. Second, we also revisit CP-LRP as a
diagnostic baseline and find that bypassing relevance propagation through the
softmax layer -- backpropagating relevance only through the value matrices --
significantly improves alignment with LOO, particularly in middle-to-late
Transformer layers. Overall, our results suggest that (i) bilinear
factorization sensitivity and (ii) softmax propagation error potentially
jointly undermine LRP's ability to approximate LOO in Transformers.

Abstract: Iterative optimization is central to modern artificial intelligence (AI) and
provides a crucial framework for understanding adaptive systems. This review
provides a unified perspective on this subject, bridging classic theory with
neural network training and biological learning. Although gradient-based
methods, powered by the efficient but biologically implausible backpropagation
(BP), dominate machine learning, their computational demands can hinder
scalability in high-dimensional settings. In contrast, derivative-free or
zeroth-order (ZO) optimization feature computationally lighter approaches that
rely only on function evaluations and randomness. While generally less sample
efficient, recent breakthroughs demonstrate that modern ZO methods can
effectively approximate gradients and achieve performance competitive with BP
in neural network models. This ZO paradigm is also particularly relevant for
biology. Its core principles of random exploration (probing) and
feedback-guided adaptation (reinforcing) parallel key mechanisms of biological
learning, offering a mathematically principled perspective on how the brain
learns. In this review, we begin by categorizing optimization approaches based
on the order of derivative information they utilize, ranging from first-,
second-, and higher-order gradient-based to ZO methods. We then explore how
these methods are adapted to the unique challenges of neural network training
and the resulting learning dynamics. Finally, we build upon these insights to
view biological learning through an optimization lens, arguing that a ZO
paradigm leverages the brain's intrinsic noise as a computational resource.
This framework not only illuminates our understanding of natural intelligence
but also holds vast implications for neuromorphic hardware, helping us design
fast and energy-efficient AI systems that exploit intrinsic hardware noise.

Motivation: 为了解决传统强化学习方法需要复杂奖励设计和多次rollout的问题，提出一种更简单高效的训练范式。

Method: 使用在线监督微调，模型生成响应后立即用这些自生成数据进行微调，默认只需一次rollout，无需奖励信号。

Result: 在挑战性数学推理任务上，OSFT达到了与GRPO等强RLVR方法相当的下游性能，且更高效鲁棒。

Conclusion: OSFT通过促进模型从预训练中学到的潜在偏好知识，提升了推理能力，为复杂奖励训练范式提供了高效替代方案。

Abstract: We present a simple, self-help online supervised finetuning (OSFT) paradigm
for LLM reasoning. In this paradigm, the model generates its own responses and
is immediately finetuned on this self-generated data. OSFT is a highly
efficient training strategy for LLM reasoning, as it is reward-free and uses
just one rollout by default. Experiment results show that OSFT achieves
downstream performance on challenging mathematical reasoning tasks comparable
to strong reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) methods such as
GRPO. Our ablation study further demonstrates the efficiency and robustness of
OSFT. The major mechanism of OSFT lies in facilitating the model's own existing
preference (latent knowledge) learned from pretraining, which leads to
reasoning ability improvement. We believe that OSFT offers an efficient and
promising alternative to more complex, reward-based training paradigms. Our
code is available at https://github.com/ElementQi/OnlineSFT.

Conclusion: SSP方法通过自博弈实现了可扩展的智能体RLVR训练，解决了传统方法对人工标注的依赖问题。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has become the
mainstream technique for training LLM agents. However, RLVR highly depends on
well-crafted task queries and corresponding ground-truth answers to provide
accurate rewards, which requires massive human efforts and hinders the RL
scaling processes, especially under agentic scenarios. Although a few recent
works explore task synthesis methods, the difficulty of generated agentic tasks
can hardly be controlled to provide effective RL training advantages. To
achieve agentic RLVR with higher scalability, we explore self-play training for
deep search agents, in which the learning LLM utilizes multi-turn search engine
calling and acts simultaneously as both a task proposer and a problem solver.
The task proposer aims to generate deep search queries with well-defined
ground-truth answers and increasing task difficulty. The problem solver tries
to handle the generated search queries and output the correct answer
predictions. To ensure that each generated search query has accurate ground
truth, we collect all the searching results from the proposer's trajectory as
external knowledge, then conduct retrieval-augmentation generation (RAG) to
test whether the proposed query can be correctly answered with all necessary
search documents provided. In this search self-play (SSP) game, the proposer
and the solver co-evolve their agent capabilities through both competition and
cooperation. With substantial experimental results, we find that SSP can
significantly improve search agents' performance uniformly on various
benchmarks without any supervision under both from-scratch and continuous RL
training setups. The code is at https://github.com/Alibaba-Quark/SSP.

Abstract: We introduce \textbf{BO4Mob}, a new benchmark framework for high-dimensional
Bayesian Optimization (BO), driven by the challenge of origin-destination (OD)
travel demand estimation in large urban road networks. Estimating OD travel
demand from limited traffic sensor data is a difficult inverse optimization
problem, particularly in real-world, large-scale transportation networks. This
problem involves optimizing over high-dimensional continuous spaces where each
objective evaluation is computationally expensive, stochastic, and
non-differentiable. BO4Mob comprises five scenarios based on real-world San
Jose, CA road networks, with input dimensions scaling up to 10,100. These
scenarios utilize high-resolution, open-source traffic simulations that
incorporate realistic nonlinear and stochastic dynamics. We demonstrate the
benchmark's utility by evaluating five optimization methods: three
state-of-the-art BO algorithms and two non-BO baselines. This benchmark is
designed to support both the development of scalable optimization algorithms
and their application for the design of data-driven urban mobility models,

Abstract: Value-based algorithms are a cornerstone of off-policy reinforcement learning
due to their simplicity and training stability. However, their use has
traditionally been restricted to discrete action spaces, as they rely on
estimating Q-values for individual state-action pairs. In continuous action
spaces, evaluating the Q-value over the entire action space becomes
computationally infeasible. To address this, actor-critic methods are typically
employed, where a critic is trained on off-policy data to estimate Q-values,
and an actor is trained to maximize the critic's output. Despite their
popularity, these methods often suffer from instability during training. In
this work, we propose a purely value-based framework for continuous control
that revisits structural maximization of Q-functions, introducing a set of key
architectural and algorithmic choices to enable efficient and stable learning.
We evaluate the proposed actor-free Q-learning approach on a range of standard
simulation tasks, demonstrating performance and sample efficiency on par with
state-of-the-art baselines, without the cost of learning a separate actor.
Particularly, in environments with constrained action spaces, where the value
functions are typically non-smooth, our method with structural maximization
outperforms traditional actor-critic methods with gradient-based maximization.

Abstract: Counterfactual inference provides a mathematical framework for reasoning
about hypothetical outcomes under alternative interventions, bridging causal
reasoning and predictive modeling. We present a counterfactual inference
framework for individualized risk estimation and intervention analysis,
illustrated through a clinical application to post-acute sequelae of COVID-19
(PASC) among patients with pre-existing heart failure (HF). Using longitudinal
diagnosis, laboratory, and medication data from a large health-system cohort,
we integrate regularized predictive modeling with counterfactual search to
identify actionable pathways to PASC-related HF hospital admissions. The
framework combines exact enumeration with optimization-based methods, including
the Nearest Instance Counterfactual Explanations (NICE) and Multi-Objective
Counterfactuals (MOC) algorithms, to efficiently explore high-dimensional
intervention spaces. Applied to more than 2700 individuals with confirmed
SARS-CoV-2 infection and prior HF, the model achieved strong discriminative
performance (AUROC: 0.88, 95% CI: 0.84-0.91) and generated interpretable,
patient-specific counterfactuals that quantify how modifying comorbidity
patterns or treatment factors could alter predicted outcomes. This work
demonstrates how counterfactual reasoning can be formalized as an optimization
problem over predictive functions, offering a rigorous, interpretable, and
computationally efficient approach to personalized inference in complex
biomedical systems.

Abstract: Adapting language models (LMs) to new tasks via post-training carries the
risk of degrading existing capabilities -- a phenomenon classically known as
catastrophic forgetting. In this paper, toward identifying guidelines for
mitigating this phenomenon, we systematically compare the forgetting patterns
of two widely adopted post-training methods: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and
reinforcement learning (RL). Our experiments reveal a consistent trend across
LM families (Llama, Qwen) and tasks (instruction following, general knowledge,
and arithmetic reasoning): RL leads to less forgetting than SFT while achieving
comparable or higher target task performance. To investigate the cause for this
difference, we consider a simplified setting in which the LM is modeled as a
mixture of two distributions, one corresponding to prior knowledge and the
other to the target task. We identify that the mode-seeking nature of RL, which
stems from its use of on-policy data, enables keeping prior knowledge intact
when learning the target task. We then verify this insight by demonstrating
that the use on-policy data underlies the robustness of RL to forgetting in
practical settings, as opposed to other algorithmic choices such as the KL
regularization or advantage estimation. Lastly, as a practical implication, our
results highlight the potential of mitigating forgetting using approximately
on-policy data, which can be substantially more efficient to obtain than fully
on-policy data.
