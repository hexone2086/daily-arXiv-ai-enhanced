### [1] [Attention-Enhanced Prototypical Learning for Few-Shot Infrastructure Defect Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05266)
*Christina Thrainer,Md Meftahul Ferdaus,Mahdi Abdelguerfi,Christian Guetl,Steven Sloan,Kendall N. Niles,Ken Pathak*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出增强特征金字塔网络(E-FPN)用于基础设施检查中的少样本语义分割，通过原型学习和注意力机制在小样本条件下有效识别新的缺陷类别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基础设施检查中标注数据稀缺且昂贵的问题，以及现有深度学习模型无法用少量数据学习新缺陷类别的局限性。

Method: 使用自适应E-FPN编码器、原型学习与掩码平均池化、以及基于注意力的特征表示（全局自注意力、局部自注意力和交叉注意力）。

Result: 在8-way 5-shot训练配置下达到82.55% F1分数和72.26% mIoU，注意力方法带来2.57% F1分数和2.9% mIoU的性能提升。

Conclusion: 该框架能够用有限的新训练数据快速响应基础设施检查系统中的新缺陷类型，实现更高效经济的维护计划。

Abstract: Few-shot semantic segmentation is vital for deep learning-based
infrastructure inspection applications, where labeled training examples are
scarce and expensive. Although existing deep learning frameworks perform well,
the need for extensive labeled datasets and the inability to learn new defect
categories with little data are problematic. We present our Enhanced Feature
Pyramid Network (E-FPN) framework for few-shot semantic segmentation of culvert
and sewer defect categories using a prototypical learning framework. Our
approach has three main contributions: (1) adaptive E-FPN encoder using
InceptionSepConv blocks and depth-wise separable convolutions for efficient
multi-scale feature extraction; (2) prototypical learning with masked average
pooling for powerful prototype generation from small support examples; and (3)
attention-based feature representation through global self-attention, local
self-attention and cross-attention. Comprehensive experimentation on
challenging infrastructure inspection datasets illustrates that the method
achieves excellent few-shot performance, with the best configuration being
8-way 5-shot training configuration at 82.55% F1-score and 72.26% mIoU in 2-way
classification testing. The self-attention method had the most significant
performance improvements, providing 2.57% F1-score and 2.9% mIoU gain over
baselines. Our framework addresses the critical need to rapidly respond to new
defect types in infrastructure inspection systems with limited new training
data that lead to more efficient and economical maintenance plans for critical
infrastructure systems.

### [2] [SkinMap: Weighted Full-Body Skin Segmentation for Robust Remote Photoplethysmography](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05296)
*Zahra Maleki,Amirhossein Akbari,Amirhossein Binesh,Babak Khalaj*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的皮肤分割技术，用于改进远程光电容积描记术(rPPG)中的心率监测，该技术能检测全身皮肤区域并去除干扰区域，在具有挑战性的条件下表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 远程光电容积描记术(rPPG)是一种低成本、非接触式的心率和生命体征监测方法，但对光照和运动敏感。在无监督流程中，需要从视频中选择皮肤区域来提取rPPG信号。

Method: 引入新颖的皮肤分割技术，优先考虑皮肤区域以增强提取信号的质量，能够检测全身皮肤区域，同时去除可能引起干扰的口、眼和头发等区域。

Result: 在公开数据集上评估，并提出了新的SYNC-rPPG数据集。模型在说话和头部旋转等挑战性条件下表现出捕捉心跳的能力，保持预测心率与实际心率之间的平均绝对误差(MAE)，而其他方法无法做到。

Conclusion: 该技术在不同肤色检测中表现出高精度，使其成为现实世界应用的有前景选择。

Abstract: Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) is an innovative method for monitoring
heart rate and vital signs by using a simple camera to record a person, as long
as any part of their skin is visible. This low-cost, contactless approach helps
in remote patient monitoring, emotion analysis, smart vehicle utilization, and
more. Over the years, various techniques have been proposed to improve the
accuracy of this technology, especially given its sensitivity to lighting and
movement. In the unsupervised pipeline, it is necessary to first select skin
regions from the video to extract the rPPG signal from the skin color changes.
We introduce a novel skin segmentation technique that prioritizes skin regions
to enhance the quality of the extracted signal. It can detect areas of skin all
over the body, making it more resistant to movement, while removing areas such
as the mouth, eyes, and hair that may cause interference. Our model is
evaluated on publicly available datasets, and we also present a new dataset,
called SYNC-rPPG, to better represent real-world conditions. The results
indicate that our model demonstrates a prior ability to capture heartbeats in
challenging conditions, such as talking and head rotation, and maintain the
mean absolute error (MAE) between predicted and actual heart rates, while other
methods fail to do so. In addition, we demonstrate high accuracy in detecting a
diverse range of skin tones, making this technique a promising option for
real-world applications.

### [3] [DeepAf: One-Shot Spatiospectral Auto-Focus Model for Digital Pathology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05315)
*Yousef Yeganeh,Maximilian Frantzen,Michael Lee,Kun-Hsing Yu,Nassir Navab,Azade Farshad*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeepAf是一个结合空间和光谱特征的自动对焦框架，可将传统显微镜转换为高效玻片扫描仪，在资源受限环境中实现实时数字病理学。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全玻片成像扫描仪成本高昂，现有低成本解决方案存在对焦不一致、耗时或泛化能力差等问题，需要开发更高效、通用的自动对焦方法。

Method: 提出DeepAf框架，通过混合架构结合空间和光谱特征进行单次对焦预测，自动回归到最佳焦距的距离并调整控制参数。

Result: 相比基于堆栈的方法减少80%对焦时间，对焦精度达0.18μm，在536个脑组织样本的临床研究中，4x放大倍数下癌症分类AUC达0.90。

Conclusion: 该系统实现了全面的硬件-软件设计，在资源受限环境中提供可访问的实时数字病理学解决方案，同时保持诊断准确性。

Abstract: While Whole Slide Imaging (WSI) scanners remain the gold standard for
digitizing pathology samples, their high cost limits accessibility in many
healthcare settings. Other low-cost solutions also face critical limitations:
automated microscopes struggle with consistent focus across varying tissue
morphology, traditional auto-focus methods require time-consuming focal stacks,
and existing deep-learning approaches either need multiple input images or lack
generalization capability across tissue types and staining protocols. We
introduce a novel automated microscopic system powered by DeepAf, a novel
auto-focus framework that uniquely combines spatial and spectral features
through a hybrid architecture for single-shot focus prediction. The proposed
network automatically regresses the distance to the optimal focal point using
the extracted spatiospectral features and adjusts the control parameters for
optimal image outcomes. Our system transforms conventional microscopes into
efficient slide scanners, reducing focusing time by 80% compared to stack-based
methods while achieving focus accuracy of 0.18 {\mu}m on the same-lab samples,
matching the performance of dual-image methods (0.19 {\mu}m) with half the
input requirements. DeepAf demonstrates robust cross-lab generalization with
only 0.72% false focus predictions and 90% of predictions within the depth of
field. Through an extensive clinical study of 536 brain tissue samples, our
system achieves 0.90 AUC in cancer classification at 4x magnification, a
significant achievement at lower magnification than typical 20x WSI scans. This
results in a comprehensive hardware-software design enabling accessible,
real-time digital pathology in resource-constrained settings while maintaining
diagnostic accuracy.

### [5] [Mitigating Diffusion Model Hallucinations with Dynamic Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05356)
*Kostas Triaridis,Alexandros Graikos,Aggelina Chatziagapi,Grigorios G. Chrysos,Dimitris Samaras*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出动态引导方法，选择性地锐化导致伪影方向的得分函数，在生成时而非后处理阶段减少扩散模型的幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型虽然能生成令人印象深刻的样本，但常常产生结构不一致的幻觉样本，这些样本位于真实数据分布的支撑集之外。这种幻觉可归因于数据分布模式之间的过度平滑。

Method: 引入动态引导方法，通过选择性地锐化预定的导致伪影方向的得分函数来减轻幻觉，同时保留有效的语义变化。

Result: 动态引导在受控和自然图像数据集上都显著减少了幻觉，明显优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 这是第一个在生成时而非通过后处理过滤来解决幻觉问题的方法，动态引导能有效减少扩散模型的幻觉生成。

Abstract: Diffusion models, despite their impressive demos, often produce hallucinatory
samples with structural inconsistencies that lie outside of the support of the
true data distribution. Such hallucinations can be attributed to excessive
smoothing between modes of the data distribution. However, semantic
interpolations are often desirable and can lead to generation diversity, thus
we believe a more nuanced solution is required. In this work, we introduce
Dynamic Guidance, which tackles this issue. Dynamic Guidance mitigates
hallucinations by selectively sharpening the score function only along the
pre-determined directions known to cause artifacts, while preserving valid
semantic variations. To our knowledge, this is the first approach that
addresses hallucinations at generation time rather than through post-hoc
filtering. Dynamic Guidance substantially reduces hallucinations on both
controlled and natural image datasets, significantly outperforming baselines.

### [6] [LightCache: Memory-Efficient, Training-Free Acceleration for Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05367)
*Yang Xiao,Gen Li,Kaiyuan Deng,Yushu Wu,Zheng Zhan,Yanzhi Wang,Xiaolong Ma,Bo Hui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种训练免费的视频生成加速方法LightCache，通过分析扩散模型推理过程中的编码、去噪和解码阶段，设计了阶段特定的内存优化策略，在保持质量的同时实现更快的推理速度和更低的内存使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于扩散模型的视频生成中，推理过程中的潜在表示冗余为加速提供了机会。现有基于缓存的加速方法在后两个阶段（去噪和解码）会导致显著的内存激增，需要解决这一问题。

Method: 将推理过程分解为编码、去噪和解码三个阶段，针对不同阶段特性提出三种策略：1）异步缓存交换；2）特征分块；3）切片潜在表示解码。确保这些策略引入的时间开销低于加速收益。

Result: 与基线相比，该方法实现了更快的推理速度和更低的内存使用，同时将质量下降控制在可接受范围内。

Conclusion: LightCache方法通过阶段特定的内存优化策略，在视频生成扩散模型中有效平衡了加速效果与内存消耗，为训练免费加速提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Training-free acceleration has emerged as an advanced research area in video
generation based on diffusion models. The redundancy of latents in diffusion
model inference provides a natural entry point for acceleration. In this paper,
we decompose the inference process into the encoding, denoising, and decoding
stages, and observe that cache-based acceleration methods often lead to
substantial memory surges in the latter two stages. To address this problem, we
analyze the characteristics of inference across different stages and propose
stage-specific strategies for reducing memory consumption: 1) Asynchronous
Cache Swapping. 2) Feature chunk. 3) Slicing latents to decode. At the same
time, we ensure that the time overhead introduced by these three strategies
remains lower than the acceleration gains themselves. Compared with the
baseline, our approach achieves faster inference speed and lower memory usage,
while maintaining quality degradation within an acceptable range. The Code is
available at https://github.com/NKUShaw/LightCache .

### [7] [See the past: Time-Reversed Scene Reconstruction from Thermal Traces Using Visual Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05408)
*Kebin Contreras,Luis Toscano-Palomino,Mauro Dalla Mura,Jorge Bacca*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于热成像的时间反演重建框架，利用RGB和热成像配对图像恢复几秒前的场景状态，通过视觉语言模型和约束扩散过程实现语义和结构一致的重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从当前观测中恢复过去状态在法医学和场景分析中具有重要应用价值。热成像能捕捉人机交互留下的热痕迹，这些逐渐消退的印记可作为被动时间编码，推断超出RGB相机能力范围的近期事件。

Method: 将视觉语言模型与约束扩散过程相结合：一个VLM生成场景描述，另一个指导图像重建，确保语义和结构一致性。使用配对的RGB和热图像作为输入。

Result: 在三个受控场景中评估，证明能够重建最多120秒前的合理过去帧，为基于热痕迹的时间反演成像提供了初步可行性验证。

Conclusion: 该工作展示了利用热成像痕迹进行时间反演重建的可行性，为从热痕迹中恢复过去场景状态提供了首个步骤。

Abstract: Recovering the past from present observations is an intriguing challenge with
potential applications in forensics and scene analysis. Thermal imaging,
operating in the infrared range, provides access to otherwise invisible
information. Since humans are typically warmer (37 C -98.6 F) than their
surroundings, interactions such as sitting, touching, or leaning leave residual
heat traces. These fading imprints serve as passive temporal codes, allowing
for the inference of recent events that exceed the capabilities of RGB cameras.
This work proposes a time-reversed reconstruction framework that uses paired
RGB and thermal images to recover scene states from a few seconds earlier. The
proposed approach couples Visual-Language Models (VLMs) with a constrained
diffusion process, where one VLM generates scene descriptions and another
guides image reconstruction, ensuring semantic and structural consistency. The
method is evaluated in three controlled scenarios, demonstrating the
feasibility of reconstructing plausible past frames up to 120 seconds earlier,
providing a first step toward time-reversed imaging from thermal traces.

### [8] [Personalizing Retrieval using Joint Embeddings or "the Return of Fluffy"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05411)
*Bruno Korbar,Andrew Zisserman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为pi-map的可训练映射网络，能够将对象实例的图像嵌入转换为文本标记，结合自然语言查询实现个性化图像检索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决使用复合查询检索图像的问题，即结合图像中的对象实例信息和自然文本描述（如对象在做什么或在哪里）来检索图像。

Method: 设计映射网络将局部图像嵌入转换为文本标记，结合自然语言查询进行CLIP风格的文本编码和图像检索。每个对象实例只需训练一次。

Result: 在个性化检索的两个基准测试中，该方法与冻结的CLIP文本和图像编码器结合使用，提升了现有技术水平。

Conclusion: pi-map方法通过将对象实例图像嵌入转换为文本标记，有效提升了复合查询的个性化图像检索性能。

Abstract: The goal of this paper is to be able to retrieve images using a compound
query that combines object instance information from an image, with a natural
text description of what that object is doing or where it is. For example, to
retrieve an image of "Fluffy the unicorn (specified by an image) on someone's
head". To achieve this we design a mapping network that can "translate" from a
local image embedding (of the object instance) to a text token, such that the
combination of the token and a natural language query is suitable for CLIP
style text encoding, and image retrieval. Generating a text token in this
manner involves a simple training procedure, that only needs to be performed
once for each object instance. We show that our approach of using a trainable
mapping network, termed pi-map, together with frozen CLIP text and image
encoders, improves the state of the art on two benchmarks designed to assess
personalized retrieval.

### [9] [ArchitectHead: Continuous Level of Detail Control for 3D Gaussian Head Avatars](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05488)
*Peizhi Yan,Rabab Ward,Qiang Tang,Shan Du*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ArchitectHead是首个支持连续控制细节级别(LOD)的3D高斯人头化身框架，通过UV特征场和动态重采样实现无需重新训练的多分辨率渲染。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3DGS化身使用固定数量的高斯点，无法根据实际需求调整渲染效率与视觉质量的平衡，需要支持可调节的细节级别。

Method: 在2D UV特征空间中参数化高斯点，构建多级可学习特征图组成的UV特征场，通过轻量神经网络解码器将潜在特征转换为3D高斯属性，通过动态重采样特征图控制高斯点数量。

Result: 在最高LOD下实现SOTA质量，最低LOD仅使用6.2%的高斯点，质量适度下降(L1损失+7.9%等)，渲染速度几乎翻倍。

Conclusion: ArchitectHead实现了无需重新训练的连续LOD控制，在保持高质量的同时显著提升渲染效率。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has enabled photorealistic and real-time
rendering of 3D head avatars. Existing 3DGS-based avatars typically rely on
tens of thousands of 3D Gaussian points (Gaussians), with the number of
Gaussians fixed after training. However, many practical applications require
adjustable levels of detail (LOD) to balance rendering efficiency and visual
quality. In this work, we propose "ArchitectHead", the first framework for
creating 3D Gaussian head avatars that support continuous control over LOD. Our
key idea is to parameterize the Gaussians in a 2D UV feature space and propose
a UV feature field composed of multi-level learnable feature maps to encode
their latent features. A lightweight neural network-based decoder then
transforms these latent features into 3D Gaussian attributes for rendering.
ArchitectHead controls the number of Gaussians by dynamically resampling
feature maps from the UV feature field at the desired resolutions. This method
enables efficient and continuous control of LOD without retraining.
Experimental results show that ArchitectHead achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA)
quality in self and cross-identity reenactment tasks at the highest LOD, while
maintaining near SOTA performance at lower LODs. At the lowest LOD, our method
uses only 6.2\% of the Gaussians while the quality degrades moderately (L1 Loss
+7.9\%, PSNR --0.97\%, SSIM --0.6\%, LPIPS Loss +24.1\%), and the rendering
speed nearly doubles.

*James Dickens*

TL;DR: 提出了一种利用3D点云进行人体动作识别的新方法，通过分割、跟踪和身体部位分割来处理深度传感器和单目深度估计的点云数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着消费级深度传感器和激光雷达的普及，需要开发基于密集3D数据的动作识别方法，作为骨骼动作识别和视频方法的替代方案。

Method: 采用结合点云技术和稀疏卷积网络的3D动作识别骨干网络，对体素映射的点云序列进行处理，并加入表面法线、颜色、红外强度等辅助特征。

Conclusion: 该方法证明了利用3D点云进行动作识别的可行性，为动作识别提供了新的技术路径。

Abstract: Recent research into human action recognition (HAR) has focused predominantly
on skeletal action recognition and video-based methods. With the increasing
availability of consumer-grade depth sensors and Lidar instruments, there is a
growing opportunity to leverage dense 3D data for action recognition, to
develop a third way. This paper presents a novel approach for recognizing
actions from 3D videos by introducing a pipeline that segments human point
clouds from the background of a scene, tracks individuals over time, and
performs body part segmentation. The method supports point clouds from both
depth sensors and monocular depth estimation. At the core of the proposed HAR
framework is a novel backbone for 3D action recognition, which combines
point-based techniques with sparse convolutional networks applied to
voxel-mapped point cloud sequences. Experiments incorporate auxiliary point
features including surface normals, color, infrared intensity, and body part
parsing labels, to enhance recognition accuracy. Evaluation on the NTU RGB- D
120 dataset demonstrates that the method is competitive with existing skeletal
action recognition algorithms. Moreover, combining both sensor-based and
estimated depth inputs in an ensemble setup, this approach achieves 89.3%
accuracy when different human subjects are considered for training and testing,
outperforming previous point cloud action recognition methods.

*Shinnosuke Saito,Takashi Matsubara*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的黎曼度量方法，用于在扩散模型的噪声空间中生成更自然的数据流形感知插值路径。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型缺乏显式的低维潜在空间，限制了基于流形的分析和操作。现有插值方法通常穿过高密度区域，而非沿着数据流形，导致感知不自然的过渡。

Method: 基于分数函数雅可比矩阵捕获局部数据流形切空间的最新发现，在噪声空间中提出了一种新的黎曼度量，使测地线保持在或平行于学习的数据流形。

Result: 图像插值实验表明，该度量方法比现有的基于密度和朴素基线方法产生感知上更自然和忠实的过渡。

Conclusion: 所提出的黎曼度量能够有效利用扩散模型学习的数据流形，为扩散模型提供了更好的流形感知插值能力。

Abstract: Diffusion models are powerful deep generative models (DGMs) that generate
high-fidelity, diverse content. However, unlike classical DGMs, they lack an
explicit, tractable low-dimensional latent space that parameterizes the data
manifold. This absence limits manifold-aware analysis and operations, such as
interpolation and editing. Existing interpolation methods for diffusion models
typically follow paths through high-density regions, which are not necessarily
aligned with the data manifold and can yield perceptually unnatural
transitions. To exploit the data manifold learned by diffusion models, we
propose a novel Riemannian metric on the noise space, inspired by recent
findings that the Jacobian of the score function captures the tangent spaces to
the local data manifold. This metric encourages geodesics in the noise space to
stay within or run parallel to the learned data manifold. Experiments on image
interpolation show that our metric produces perceptually more natural and
faithful transitions than existing density-based and naive baselines.

*Sam Sartor,Pieter Peers*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Teamwork是一种灵活统一的解决方案，通过协调多个基础扩散模型实例来扩展输入输出通道，无需改变预训练模型架构，适用于多种图形任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的通道扩展方法通常是特定于应用的，难以适应不同的扩散模型或新任务。需要一种灵活且高效的统一解决方案来同时增加输入输出通道并适应新任务。

Method: 使用多个基础扩散模型实例（队友）进行协调，采用新颖的低秩适应（LoRA）变体来处理适应和协调问题，支持动态激活/停用队友。

Result: 在多种生成和逆图形任务上展示了Teamwork的灵活性和效率，包括修复、SVBRDF估计、本征分解、神经着色和本征图像合成。

Conclusion: Teamwork提供了一种无需修改预训练模型架构的通道扩展方法，通过协调多个模型实例实现了在各种图形任务中的灵活应用。

Abstract: Large pretrained diffusion models can provide strong priors beneficial for
many graphics applications. However, generative applications such as neural
rendering and inverse methods such as SVBRDF estimation and intrinsic image
decomposition require additional input or output channels. Current solutions
for channel expansion are often application specific and these solutions can be
difficult to adapt to different diffusion models or new tasks. This paper
introduces Teamwork: a flexible and efficient unified solution for jointly
increasing the number of input and output channels as well as adapting a
pretrained diffusion model to new tasks. Teamwork achieves channel expansion
without altering the pretrained diffusion model architecture by coordinating
and adapting multiple instances of the base diffusion model (\ie, teammates).
We employ a novel variation of Low Rank-Adaptation (LoRA) to jointly address
both adaptation and coordination between the different teammates. Furthermore
Teamwork supports dynamic (de)activation of teammates. We demonstrate the
flexibility and efficiency of Teamwork on a variety of generative and inverse
graphics tasks such as inpainting, single image SVBRDF estimation, intrinsic
decomposition, neural shading, and intrinsic image synthesis.

### [13] [Seeing the Big Picture: Evaluating Multimodal LLMs' Ability to Interpret and Grade Handwritten Student Work](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05538)
*Owen Henkel,Bill Roberts,Doug Jaffe,Laurence Holt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) raise the
question of their potential for grading, analyzing, and offering feedback on
handwritten student classwork. This capability would be particularly beneficial
in elementary and middle-school mathematics education, where most work remains
handwritten, because seeing students' full working of a problem provides
valuable insights into their learning processes, but is extremely
time-consuming to grade. We present two experiments investigating MLLM
performance on handwritten student mathematics classwork. Experiment A examines
288 handwritten responses from Ghanaian middle school students solving
arithmetic problems with objective answers. In this context, models achieved
near-human accuracy (95%, k = 0.90) but exhibited occasional errors that human
educators would be unlikely to make. Experiment B evaluates 150 mathematical
illustrations from American elementary students, where the drawings are the
answer to the question. These tasks lack single objective answers and require
sophisticated visual interpretation as well as pedagogical judgment in order to
analyze and evaluate them. We attempted to separate MLLMs' visual capabilities
from their pedagogical abilities by first asking them to grade the student
illustrations directly, and then by augmenting the image with a detailed human
description of the illustration. We found that when the models had to analyze
the student illustrations directly, they struggled, achieving only k = 0.20
with ground truth scores, but when given human descriptions, their agreement
levels improved dramatically to k = 0.47, which was in line with human-to-human
agreement levels. This gap suggests MLLMs can "see" and interpret arithmetic
work relatively well, but still struggle to "see" student mathematical
illustrations.

TL;DR: Midway Network是一种自监督学习架构，通过扩展潜在动态建模到自然视频领域，同时学习物体识别和运动理解的视觉表征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自监督学习方法主要专注于识别或运动的表征学习，而潜在动态建模主要用于决策任务。需要一种能够同时处理物体识别和运动理解的方法。

Method: 使用中途自上而下路径推断视频帧间的运动潜在变量，结合密集前向预测目标和层次结构来处理复杂多物体场景。

Result: 在两个大规模自然视频数据集上预训练后，Midway Network在语义分割和光流任务上相对于先前自监督学习方法表现出强大性能。

Conclusion: Midway Network成功地将潜在动态建模扩展到视觉领域，能够同时学习物体识别和运动理解的强表征，并通过前向特征扰动分析验证了其学习动态能够捕捉高层次对应关系。

Abstract: Object recognition and motion understanding are key components of perception
that complement each other. While self-supervised learning methods have shown
promise in their ability to learn from unlabeled data, they have primarily
focused on obtaining rich representations for either recognition or motion
rather than both in tandem. On the other hand, latent dynamics modeling has
been used in decision making to learn latent representations of observations
and their transformations over time for control and planning tasks. In this
work, we present Midway Network, a new self-supervised learning architecture
that is the first to learn strong visual representations for both object
recognition and motion understanding solely from natural videos, by extending
latent dynamics modeling to this domain. Midway Network leverages a midway
top-down path to infer motion latents between video frames, as well as a dense
forward prediction objective and hierarchical structure to tackle the complex,
multi-object scenes of natural videos. We demonstrate that after pretraining on
two large-scale natural video datasets, Midway Network achieves strong
performance on both semantic segmentation and optical flow tasks relative to
prior self-supervised learning methods. We also show that Midway Network's
learned dynamics can capture high-level correspondence via a novel analysis
method based on forward feature perturbation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前3D重建和场景理解方法在几何完整性、物体交互性、物理合理性、逼真渲染或可靠动态模拟等方面存在不足，需要一种能同时满足这些要求的解决方案。

Method: 采用综合交互式场景图表示，编码物体几何、外观和物理属性以及层次关系；将重建表述为基于能量的优化问题，整合观测数据、物理约束和生成先验；使用采样探索与梯度优化的混合方法进行高效优化。

Result: 生成的数字孪生具有完整精确的几何结构、物理稳定性和新颖视角下的逼真渲染效果；在多个基准数据集上表现出优越性能，并在交互游戏和实时数字孪生操作中展示了广泛适用性。

Conclusion: HoloScene框架成功解决了当前3D重建方法的局限性，为增强现实、虚拟现实、游戏和机器人等领域提供了高质量的交互式数字孪生生成方案。

Abstract: Digitizing the physical world into accurate simulation-ready virtual
environments offers significant opportunities in a variety of fields such as
augmented and virtual reality, gaming, and robotics. However, current 3D
reconstruction and scene-understanding methods commonly fall short in one or
more critical aspects, such as geometry completeness, object interactivity,
physical plausibility, photorealistic rendering, or realistic physical
properties for reliable dynamic simulation. To address these limitations, we
introduce HoloScene, a novel interactive 3D reconstruction framework that
simultaneously achieves these requirements. HoloScene leverages a comprehensive
interactive scene-graph representation, encoding object geometry, appearance,
and physical properties alongside hierarchical and inter-object relationships.
Reconstruction is formulated as an energy-based optimization problem,
integrating observational data, physical constraints, and generative priors
into a unified, coherent objective. Optimization is efficiently performed via a
hybrid approach combining sampling-based exploration with gradient-based
refinement. The resulting digital twins exhibit complete and precise geometry,
physical stability, and realistic rendering from novel viewpoints. Evaluations
conducted on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate superior performance,
while practical use-cases in interactive gaming and real-time digital-twin
manipulation illustrate HoloScene's broad applicability and effectiveness.

TL;DR: CalibCLIP是一种无需训练的方法，通过对比视觉增强器和判别概念校准器来校准视觉语言模型中主导令牌的抑制效应，提升文本驱动图像检索性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型存在结构限制，少数低贡献令牌可能过度捕获全局语义，主导信息聚合过程并抑制文本驱动图像检索任务中的判别特征。

Method: 在视觉空间提出对比视觉增强器，将视觉特征解耦为目标和低信息区域，识别主导令牌并动态抑制其表示；在文本空间引入判别概念校准器，区分文本查询中的通用和判别概念。

Result: 在涵盖三个图像检索任务的七个基准测试中均取得一致改进，证明了CalibCLIP的有效性。

Conclusion: CalibCLIP通过校准主导令牌的抑制效应，有效提升了文本驱动图像检索的性能，无需额外训练即可实现显著改进。

Abstract: Existing Visual Language Models (VLMs) suffer structural limitations where a
few low contribution tokens may excessively capture global semantics,
dominating the information aggregation process and suppressing the
discriminative features in text-driven image retrieval tasks. To address this,
we introduce \textbf{CalibCLIP}, a training-free method designed to calibrate
the suppressive effect of dominant tokens. Specifically, in the visual space,
we propose the Contrastive Visual Enhancer (CVE), which decouples visual
features into target and low information regions. Subsequently, it identifies
dominant tokens and dynamically suppresses their representations.In the textual
space, we introduce the Discriminative Concept Calibrator (DCC), which aims to
differentiate between general and discriminative concepts within the text
query. By mitigating the challenges posed by generic concepts and improving the
representations of discriminative concepts, DCC strengthens the differentiation
among similar samples. Finally, extensive experiments demonstrate consistent
improvements across seven benchmarks spanning three image retrieval tasks,
underscoring the effectiveness of CalibCLIP. Code is available at:

TL;DR: ShortCoTI是一个轻量级优化框架，通过强化学习减少图像生成中的思维链冗余，在保持图像质量的同时将提示推理长度减少54%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于思维链的多模态大语言模型在图像生成中存在视觉过度思考问题，导致计算成本增加和细节矛盾。

Method: 引入自适应奖励函数的强化学习框架，根据任务难度调整奖励，鼓励生成更简洁的思维链提示。

Result: 在T2I-CompBench和GenEval基准测试中，推理长度减少54%，同时保持或略微提升质量指标。

Conclusion: ShortCoTI在不影响生成图像保真度和视觉吸引力的前提下，显著提高了计算效率。

Abstract: Autoregressive multimodal large language models have recently gained
popularity for image generation, driven by advances in foundation models. To
enhance alignment and detail, newer approaches employ chain-of-thought (CoT)
reasoning, expanding user inputs into elaborated prompts prior to image
synthesis. However, this strategy can introduce unnecessary redundancy -- a
phenomenon we call visual overthinking -- which increases computational costs
and can introduce details that contradict the original prompt. In this work, we
explore how to generate more concise CoT sequences for more efficient image
generation. We introduce ShortCoTI, a lightweight optimization framework that
encourages more concise CoT while preserving output image quality. ShortCoTI
rewards more concise prompts with an adaptive function that scales according to
an estimated difficulty for each task. Incorporating this reward into a
reinforcement learning paradigm reduces prompt reasoning length by 54% while
maintaining or slightly improving quality metrics across multiple benchmarks
(T2I-CompBench, GenEval). Qualitative analysis shows that our method eliminates
verbose explanations and repetitive refinements, producing reasoning prompts
that are both concise and semantically rich. As a result, ShortCoTI improves
computational efficiency without compromising the fidelity or visual appeal of
generated images.

TL;DR: 提出了HOI-R1方法，首次探索语言模型在人类-物体交互检测任务中的潜力，无需额外检测模块，通过强化学习实现纯文本的HOI检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有HOID方法依赖视觉语言模型的先验知识，训练策略和模型架构复杂；而多模态语言模型在HOID任务中的推理能力未被充分探索。

Method: 引入HOI推理过程和HOID奖励函数，通过强化学习训练多模态语言模型，实现纯文本的HOI检测，无需额外检测模块。

Result: 在HICO-DET数据集上，HOI-R1达到基线方法2倍的准确率，并具有出色的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 证明了语言模型在HOID任务中的潜力，提供了一种无需复杂检测模块的简洁解决方案。

Abstract: Recent Human-object interaction detection (HOID) methods highly require prior
knowledge from VLMs to enhance the interaction recognition capabilities. The
training strategies and model architectures for connecting the knowledge from
VLMs to the HOI instance representations from the object detector are
challenging, and the whole framework is complex for further development or
application. On the other hand, the inherent reasoning abilities of MLLMs on
human-object interaction detection are under-explored. Inspired by the recent
success of training MLLMs with reinforcement learning (RL) methods, we propose
HOI-R1 and first explore the potential of the language model on the HOID task
without any additional detection modules. We introduce an HOI reasoning process
and HOID reward functions to solve the HOID task by pure text. The results on
the HICO-DET dataset show that HOI-R1 achieves 2x the accuracy of the baseline
with great generalization ability. The source code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自回归模型在复杂空间条件生成时需要微调预训练模型，导致训练成本高昂，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 使用轻量级控制模块，包含上下文感知注意力层和共享门控前馈网络，并引入早期中心采样策略和温度调度机制。

Result: 在基于尺度的自回归模型上进行广泛实验，验证了该方法在保持高保真度和多样性的同时，显著提升了训练和推理效率。

Conclusion: ECM框架能够实现高效且高质量的图像生成控制，超越了现有基线方法。

Abstract: Recent advances in autoregressive (AR) models have demonstrated their
potential to rival diffusion models in image synthesis. However, for complex
spatially-conditioned generation, current AR approaches rely on fine-tuning the
pre-trained model, leading to significant training costs. In this paper, we
propose the Efficient Control Model (ECM), a plug-and-play framework featuring
a lightweight control module that introduces control signals via a distributed
architecture. This architecture consists of context-aware attention layers that
refine conditional features using real-time generated tokens, and a shared
gated feed-forward network (FFN) designed to maximize the utilization of its
limited capacity and ensure coherent control feature learning. Furthermore,
recognizing the critical role of early-stage generation in determining semantic
structure, we introduce an early-centric sampling strategy that prioritizes
learning early control sequences. This approach reduces computational cost by
lowering the number of training tokens per iteration, while a complementary
temperature scheduling during inference compensates for the resulting
insufficient training of late-stage tokens. Extensive experiments on
scale-based AR models validate that our method achieves high-fidelity and
diverse control over image generation, surpassing existing baselines while
significantly improving both training and inference efficiency.

TL;DR: PointNSP是一个从粗到细的自回归点云生成框架，通过多尺度分解解决了传统自回归方法在无序点集上强加人工排序的问题，首次在自回归范式中实现了最先进的生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自回归点云生成方法由于在无序点集上强加人工排序，导致模型过度关注局部连续性而忽视全局结构特性（如对称性、拓扑一致性等），性能一直落后于扩散方法。

Method: 提出PointNSP框架，基于形状建模中的细节层次原则，采用从粗到细的生成策略：在低分辨率保持全局形状结构，通过下一尺度预测范式逐步细化高尺度下的精细几何。

Result: 在ShapeNet上的实验表明，PointNSP首次在自回归范式中达到最先进的生成质量，并且在参数、训练和推理效率上超越了强扩散基线，在8192个点的密集生成中优势更加明显。

Conclusion: PointNSP通过多尺度分解使自回归目标与点集的置换不变性对齐，证明了自回归方法在点云生成中的潜力，特别是在可扩展性方面具有显著优势。

Abstract: Autoregressive point cloud generation has long lagged behind diffusion-based
approaches in quality. The performance gap stems from the fact that
autoregressive models impose an artificial ordering on inherently unordered
point sets, forcing shape generation to proceed as a sequence of local
predictions. This sequential bias emphasizes short-range continuity but
undermines the model's capacity to capture long-range dependencies, hindering
its ability to enforce global structural properties such as symmetry,
consistent topology, and large-scale geometric regularities. Inspired by the
level-of-detail (LOD) principle in shape modeling, we propose PointNSP, a
coarse-to-fine generative framework that preserves global shape structure at
low resolutions and progressively refines fine-grained geometry at higher
scales through a next-scale prediction paradigm. This multi-scale factorization
aligns the autoregressive objective with the permutation-invariant nature of
point sets, enabling rich intra-scale interactions while avoiding brittle fixed
orderings. Experiments on ShapeNet show that PointNSP establishes
state-of-the-art (SOTA) generation quality for the first time within the
autoregressive paradigm. In addition, it surpasses strong diffusion-based
baselines in parameter, training, and inference efficiency. Finally, in dense
generation with 8,192 points, PointNSP's advantages become even more
pronounced, underscoring its scalability potential.

Abstract: Tear film break-up (TFBU) analysis is critical for diagnosing dry eye
syndrome, but automated TFBU segmentation remains challenging due to the lack
of annotated datasets and integrated solutions. This paper introduces the Tear
Film Multi-task (TFM) Dataset, the first comprehensive dataset for multi-task
tear film analysis, comprising 15 high-resolution videos (totaling 6,247
frames) annotated with three vision tasks: frame-level classification ('clear',
'closed', 'broken', 'blur'), Placido Ring detection, and pixel-wise TFBU area
segmentation. Leveraging this dataset, we first propose TF-Net, a novel and
efficient baseline segmentation model. TF-Net incorporates a MobileOne-mini
backbone with re-parameterization techniques and an enhanced feature pyramid
network to achieve a favorable balance between accuracy and computational
efficiency for real-time clinical applications. We further establish benchmark
performance on the TFM segmentation subset by comparing TF-Net against several
state-of-the-art medical image segmentation models. Furthermore, we design
TF-Collab, a novel integrated real-time pipeline that synergistically leverages
models trained on all three tasks of the TFM dataset. By sequentially
orchestrating frame classification for BUT determination, pupil region
localization for input standardization, and TFBU segmentation, TF-Collab fully
automates the analysis. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed TF-Net and TF-Collab, providing a foundation for future research
in ocular surface diagnostics. Our code and the TFM datasets are available at

TL;DR: InstaGeo是一个端到端的地理空间AI框架，通过自动化数据管道、模型蒸馏和Web部署，解决了现有地理空间基础模型部署中的两大挑战：缺乏自动化数据处理流程和模型过大问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有地理空间基础模型(GFMs)部署受限，主要因为缺乏自动化地理空间数据管道，以及微调后的模型仍然过大，难以实际应用。

Method: 集成三个核心组件：(1)自动化数据整理，将原始卫星图像转换为模型就绪数据集；(2)任务特定模型蒸馏，生成紧凑高效模型；(3)无缝部署为交互式Web地图应用。

Result: 在三个任务上验证：洪水测绘(mIoU差异-0.73pp)、作物分割(-0.20pp)和沙漠蝗虫预测(+1.79pp)。蒸馏模型比标准微调模型小8倍，减少FLOPs和CO2排放。作物分割数据集达到60.65% mIoU，比基线提升12pp。

Conclusion: InstaGeo将研究级GFMs转化为实用的低碳工具，推动地理空间AI向数据质量和应用驱动创新转变，可在单个工作日内完成从原始数据到模型部署的全流程。

Abstract: Open-access multispectral imagery from missions like Landsat 8-9 and
Sentinel-2 has fueled the development of geospatial foundation models (GFMs)
for humanitarian and environmental applications. Yet, their deployment remains
limited by (i) the absence of automated geospatial data pipelines and (ii) the
large size of fine-tuned models. Existing GFMs lack workflows for processing
raw satellite imagery, and downstream adaptations often retain the full
complexity of the original encoder.
  We present InstaGeo, an open-source, end-to-end framework that addresses
these challenges by integrating: (1) automated data curation to transform raw
imagery into model-ready datasets; (2) task-specific model distillation to
derive compact, compute-efficient models; and (3) seamless deployment as
interactive web-map applications. Using InstaGeo, we reproduced datasets from
three published studies and trained models with marginal mIoU differences of
-0.73 pp for flood mapping, -0.20 pp for crop segmentation, and +1.79 pp for
desert locust prediction. The distilled models are up to 8x smaller than
standard fine-tuned counterparts, reducing FLOPs and CO2 emissions with minimal
accuracy loss.
  Leveraging InstaGeo's streamlined data pipeline, we also curated a larger
crop segmentation dataset, achieving a state-of-the-art mIoU of 60.65%, a 12 pp
improvement over prior baselines. Moreover, InstaGeo enables users to progress
from raw data to model deployment within a single working day.
  By unifying data preparation, model compression, and deployment, InstaGeo
transforms research-grade GFMs into practical, low-carbon tools for real-time,
large-scale Earth observation. This approach shifts geospatial AI toward data
quality and application-driven innovation. Source code, datasets, and model

TL;DR: 该论文系统研究了基于深度学习的伪造图像检测器是否真正依赖频谱峰值作为检测依据，通过移除频谱峰值的方法验证了大多数检测器并不依赖这些峰值，挑战了该领域的普遍假设。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前伪造图像检测器通常被视为黑盒，不清楚它们是否真正依赖频域伪影（特别是频谱中的周期性峰值）来检测合成图像，这限制了检测器的可解释性和可信度。

Method: 提出了一种移除图像频谱峰值的方法，并分析这种操作对多个检测器的影响；同时引入了一个仅依赖频率峰值的简单线性检测器作为完全可解释的基线。

Result: 研究发现大多数检测器并不从根本上依赖频谱峰值，挑战了该领域关于频谱峰值是合成图像强指标的普遍假设。

Conclusion: 这项工作为开发更透明和可靠的取证工具铺平了道路，强调了需要超越频谱峰值依赖的检测方法。

Abstract: Over the years, the forensics community has proposed several deep
learning-based detectors to mitigate the risks of generative AI. Recently,
frequency-domain artifacts (particularly periodic peaks in the magnitude
spectrum), have received significant attention, as they have been often
considered a strong indicator of synthetic image generation. However,
state-of-the-art detectors are typically used as black-boxes, and it still
remains unclear whether they truly rely on these peaks. This limits their
interpretability and trust. In this work, we conduct a systematic study to
address this question. We propose a strategy to remove spectral peaks from
images and analyze the impact of this operation on several detectors. In
addition, we introduce a simple linear detector that relies exclusively on
frequency peaks, providing a fully interpretable baseline free from the
confounding influence of deep learning. Our findings reveal that most detectors
are not fundamentally dependent on spectral peaks, challenging a widespread
assumption in the field and paving the way for more transparent and reliable
forensic tools.

Motivation: 双曲空间能表示更丰富的结构（如树结构），但双曲空间中的监督代理损失尚未实现，而代理损失在大规模数据集上具有训练复杂度低的优势。

Method: 提出CHEST损失函数，包含双曲空间和欧几里得空间的代理损失，以及基于双曲层次聚类的正则化损失。

Result: 双曲空间和欧几里得空间的组合提高了DML的准确性和学习稳定性，在四个基准数据集上达到了新的最先进性能。

Conclusion: CHEST损失成功解决了在双曲空间中应用代理损失的问题，通过空间组合显著提升了深度度量学习的性能。

Abstract: Deep metric learning (DML) aims to learn a neural network mapping data to an
embedding space, which can represent semantic similarity between data points.
Hyperbolic space is attractive for DML since it can represent richer
structures, such as tree structures. DML in hyperbolic space is based on
pair-based loss or unsupervised regularization loss. On the other hand,
supervised proxy-based losses in hyperbolic space have not been reported yet
due to some issues in applying proxy-based losses in a hyperbolic space.
However, proxy-based losses are attractive for large-scale datasets since they
have less training complexity. To address these, this paper proposes the
Combined Hyperbolic and Euclidean Soft Triple (CHEST) loss. CHEST loss is
composed of the proxy-based losses in hyperbolic and Euclidean spaces and the
regularization loss based on hyperbolic hierarchical clustering. We find that
the combination of hyperbolic and Euclidean spaces improves DML accuracy and
learning stability for both spaces. Finally, we evaluate the CHEST loss on four
benchmark datasets, achieving a new state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了两个深度学习框架：AHP-CADNet用于眼源性异常头位自动诊断，以及基于课程学习的插补框架处理缺失数据，在PoseGaze-AHP数据集上表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 眼源性异常头位(AHP)是斜视等眼部错位引起的代偿机制，早期诊断可减少并发症。当前临床评估主观性强且受不完整医疗记录影响，需要自动化解决方案。

Method: 1. AHP-CADNet：多级注意力融合框架，整合眼部标志点、头部姿态特征和结构化临床属性进行可解释预测
2. 课程学习插补框架：逐步利用结构化和非结构化临床数据来缓解缺失数据问题

Result: AHP-CADNet在分类任务中准确率达96.9-99.0%，连续变量预测MAE为0.103-0.199，R²超过0.93。插补框架在所有临床变量上保持高准确率(93.46-99.78%)，临床依赖建模显著改善(p < 0.001)。

Conclusion: 两个框架在临床环境中对自动诊断和缺失数据恢复都表现出有效性，为眼源性异常头位的客观评估提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Ocular-induced abnormal head posture (AHP) is a compensatory mechanism that
arises from ocular misalignment conditions, such as strabismus, enabling
patients to reduce diplopia and preserve binocular vision. Early diagnosis
minimizes morbidity and secondary complications such as facial asymmetry;
however, current clinical assessments remain largely subjective and are further
complicated by incomplete medical records. This study addresses both challenges
through two complementary deep learning frameworks. First, AHP-CADNet is a
multi-level attention fusion framework for automated diagnosis that integrates
ocular landmarks, head pose features, and structured clinical attributes to
generate interpretable predictions. Second, a curriculum learning-based
imputation framework is designed to mitigate missing data by progressively
leveraging structured variables and unstructured clinical notes to enhance
diagnostic robustness under realistic data conditions. Evaluation on the
PoseGaze-AHP dataset demonstrates robust diagnostic performance. AHP-CADNet
achieves 96.9-99.0 percent accuracy across classification tasks and low
prediction errors for continuous variables, with MAE ranging from 0.103 to
0.199 and R2 exceeding 0.93. The imputation framework maintains high accuracy
across all clinical variables (93.46-99.78 percent with PubMedBERT), with
clinical dependency modeling yielding significant improvements (p < 0.001).
These findings confirm the effectiveness of both frameworks for automated
diagnosis and recovery from missing data in clinical settings.

Motivation: 现有教育AI方法主要关注短期或单智能体设置，难以系统研究课堂复杂性和跨任务复用。真实课堂整合了开放式认知、动态社交互动、情感因素和多会话发展，这些很少被同时捕捉。

Method: 基于分层CIE（认知-交互-演化）架构构建EduVerse，支持环境、智能体和会话的自定义，并提供人在环接口允许真实用户加入模拟空间。

Result: 在中学语文课堂验证中：(1)模拟IRF率(0.28-0.64)与现实课堂(0.37-0.49)匹配；(2)网络密度0.27-0.40，约三分之一同伴链接实现；(3)跨会话演化中正向转换率R+平均增加11.7%。

Conclusion: EduVerse在真实性、可复现性和可解释性之间取得平衡，为教育AI提供了可扩展平台，系统将开源以促进跨学科研究。

Abstract: Reproducing cognitive development, group interaction, and long-term evolution
in virtual classrooms remains a core challenge for educational AI, as real
classrooms integrate open-ended cognition, dynamic social interaction,
affective factors, and multi-session development rarely captured together.
Existing approaches mostly focus on short-term or single-agent settings,
limiting systematic study of classroom complexity and cross-task reuse. We
present EduVerse, the first user-defined multi-agent simulation space that
supports environment, agent, and session customization. A distinctive
human-in-the-loop interface further allows real users to join the space. Built
on a layered CIE (Cognition-Interaction-Evolution) architecture, EduVerse
ensures individual consistency, authentic interaction, and longitudinal
adaptation in cognition, emotion, and behavior-reproducing realistic classroom
dynamics with seamless human-agent integration. We validate EduVerse in
middle-school Chinese classes across three text genres, environments, and
multiple sessions. Results show: (1) Instructional alignment: simulated IRF
rates (0.28-0.64) closely match real classrooms (0.37-0.49), indicating
pedagogical realism; (2) Group interaction and role differentiation: network
density (0.27-0.40) with about one-third of peer links realized, while
human-agent tasks indicate a balance between individual variability and
instructional stability; (3) Cross-session evolution: the positive transition
rate R+ increase by 11.7% on average, capturing longitudinal shifts in
behavior, emotion, and cognition and revealing structured learning
trajectories. Overall, EduVerse balances realism, reproducibility, and
interpretability, providing a scalable platform for educational AI. The system
will be open-sourced to foster cross-disciplinary research.

static keypoints are assigned predicted depth values and backprojected into 3D
to form metrically scaled features. These are processed by an unmodified RGB-D
SLAM back end for tracking and mapping. On the TUM RGB-D benchmark, DropD-SLAM
attains 7.4 cm mean ATE on static sequences and 1.8 cm on dynamic sequences,
matching or surpassing state-of-the-art RGB-D methods while operating at 22 FPS
on a single GPU. These results suggest that modern pretrained vision models can
replace active depth sensors as reliable, real-time sources of metric scale,
marking a step toward simpler and more cost-effective SLAM systems.

TL;DR: SD-MVSum扩展了基于脚本的视频摘要方法，通过加权跨模态注意力机制同时考虑脚本与视频内容、脚本与语音转录的语义相关性，提升了摘要质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的脚本驱动视频摘要方法主要关注视觉内容，忽略了语音转录信息的重要性，需要更全面地利用多模态信息。

Method: 提出加权跨模态注意力机制，建模脚本-视频和脚本-转录两种模态对的依赖关系，利用语义相似性来突出与脚本最相关的视频片段。

Result: 实验证明SD-MVSum在脚本驱动和通用视频摘要任务中具有竞争力，优于其他SOTA方法。

Conclusion: 同时考虑视觉和语音模态能显著提升脚本驱动视频摘要性能，扩展的数据集为多模态视频摘要研究提供了更好的基准。

Abstract: In this work, we extend a recent method for script-driven video
summarization, originally considering just the visual content of the video, to
take into account the relevance of the user-provided script also with the
video's spoken content. In the proposed method, SD-MVSum, the dependence
between each considered pair of data modalities, i.e., script-video and
script-transcript, is modeled using a new weighted cross-modal attention
mechanism. This explicitly exploits the semantic similarity between the paired
modalities in order to promote the parts of the full-length video with the
highest relevance to the user-provided script. Furthermore, we extend two
large-scale datasets for video summarization (S-VideoXum, MrHiSum), to make
them suitable for training and evaluation of script-driven multimodal video
summarization methods. Experimental comparisons document the competitiveness of
our SD-MVSum method against other SOTA approaches for script-driven and generic
video summarization. Our new method and extended datasets are available at:

TL;DR: 提出ARGUS模型用于肝癌组织学分型，通过捕获肿瘤微环境中的宏观-中观-微观层次信息，结合几何特征和层次视野对齐，实现更准确的肝癌亚型分类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 肝癌是消化系统中最异质和预后差异最大的癌症，HCC和ICC两种主要亚型在组织形态和细胞结构上比其他常见肿瘤更复杂。现有方法未能充分利用WSI中的层次金字塔结构、肿瘤微环境和几何表示等关键信息，导致对组织学表示理解有限和分型性能不佳。

Method: 1. 构建微观几何特征表示细胞级精细模式；2. 设计层次视野对齐模块建模宏观和中观层次交互；3. 通过几何先验引导融合策略将增强的微观几何和视野特征融合为联合表示。

Result: 在公共和私有队列上的广泛实验表明，ARGUS在肝癌组织学分型中实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: ARGUS为临床实践中的原发性肝癌提供了有效的诊断工具，通过捕获多层次信息显著提升了肝癌亚型分类的准确性。

Abstract: Primary liver malignancies are widely recognized as the most heterogeneous
and prognostically diverse cancers of the digestive system. Among these,
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) emerge
as the two principal histological subtypes, demonstrating significantly greater
complexity in tissue morphology and cellular architecture than other common
tumors. The intricate representation of features in Whole Slide Images (WSIs)
encompasses abundant crucial information for liver cancer histological
subtyping, regarding hierarchical pyramid structure, tumor microenvironment
(TME), and geometric representation. However, recent approaches have not
adequately exploited these indispensable effective descriptors, resulting in a
limited understanding of histological representation and suboptimal subtyping
performance. To mitigate these limitations, ARGUS is proposed to advance
histological subtyping in liver cancer by capturing the macro-meso-micro
hierarchical information within the TME. Specifically, we first construct a
micro-geometry feature to represent fine-grained cell-level pattern via a
geometric structure across nuclei, thereby providing a more refined and precise
perspective for delineating pathological images. Then, a Hierarchical
Field-of-Views (FoVs) Alignment module is designed to model macro- and
meso-level hierarchical interactions inherent in WSIs. Finally, the augmented
micro-geometry and FoVs features are fused into a joint representation via
present Geometry Prior Guided Fusion strategy for modeling holistic phenotype
interactions. Extensive experiments on public and private cohorts demonstrate
that our ARGUS achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in histological
subtyping of liver cancer, which provide an effective diagnostic tool for
primary liver malignancies in clinical practice.

TL;DR: 提出一种无需训练的流程，利用预训练扩散模型将参考图像中的人物真实地插入背景场景中，实现位置感知的全局编辑和高质量个性化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常将人物定位和个性化视为独立问题，忽略了它们之间的相互联系，且依赖特定训练才能达到高性能。

Method: 结合反转技术和无分类器引导实现位置感知全局编辑，并提出掩码引导的自注意力机制来保持人物身份特征。

Result: 在多样化复合场景图像中实现了最先进的结果，在背景和人物身份保持方面表现出色。

Conclusion: 扩散模型本身具备将人物放置在复杂场景中的知识，无需任务特定训练，首次实现了无需训练的真实人物插入。

Abstract: The task of realistically inserting a human from a reference image into a
background scene is highly challenging, requiring the model to (1) determine
the correct location and poses of the person and (2) perform high-quality
personalization conditioned on the background. Previous approaches often treat
them as separate problems, overlooking their interconnections, and typically
rely on training to achieve high performance. In this work, we introduce a
unified training-free pipeline that leverages pre-trained text-to-image
diffusion models. We show that diffusion models inherently possess the
knowledge to place people in complex scenes without requiring task-specific
training. By combining inversion techniques with classifier-free guidance, our
method achieves affordance-aware global editing, seamlessly inserting people
into scenes. Furthermore, our proposed mask-guided self-attention mechanism
ensures high-quality personalization, preserving the subject's identity,
clothing, and body features from just a single reference image. To the best of
our knowledge, we are the first to perform realistic human insertions into
scenes in a training-free manner and achieve state-of-the-art results in
diverse composite scene images with excellent identity preservation in
backgrounds and subjects.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动视频编辑在计算机视觉和多媒体领域仍未被充分探索，特别是与视频生成和场景理解相比。本文专注于解决古典音乐会多摄像机录制的编辑挑战。

Method: 使用轻量级卷积-Transformer管道集成音频log-mel频谱图、可选图像嵌入和标量时间特征进行时间分割；使用CLIP编码器更新空间选择，并将干扰选择限制在同一音乐会的片段内。

Result: 模型在检测切换点方面优于先前基线，并在视觉镜头选择方面具有竞争力，推进了多模态自动视频编辑的技术水平。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在自动视频编辑任务中取得了先进成果，特别是在古典音乐会多摄像机录制编辑方面表现出色。

Abstract: Automated video editing remains an underexplored task in the computer vision
and multimedia domains, especially when contrasted with the growing interest in
video generation and scene understanding. In this work, we address the specific
challenge of editing multicamera recordings of classical music concerts by
decomposing the problem into two key sub-tasks: when to cut and how to cut.
Building on recent literature, we propose a novel multimodal architecture for
the temporal segmentation task (when to cut), which integrates log-mel
spectrograms from the audio signals, plus an optional image embedding, and
scalar temporal features through a lightweight convolutional-transformer
pipeline. For the spatial selection task (how to cut), we improve the
literature by updating from old backbones, e.g. ResNet, with a CLIP-based
encoder and constraining distractor selection to segments from the same
concert. Our dataset was constructed following a pseudo-labeling approach, in
which raw video data was automatically clustered into coherent shot segments.
We show that our models outperformed previous baselines in detecting cut points
and provide competitive visual shot selection, advancing the state of the art
in multimodal automated video editing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图像分析方法在复杂条件下（如叶片重叠）难以准确识别和量化个体幼苗，需要开发更稳健的分析方法来评估病原体对植物萌发的影响。

Method: 部署多摄像头连续捕捉萌发过程图像，开发集成形态和空间特征的新型图像分析流水线，采用时间整合方法考虑发育历史，实现个体幼苗的稳健识别。

Result: R. solani感染显著降低萌发率和早期幼苗活力。该方法在密集交织生长条件下仍保持高精度，决定系数达0.98，均方根误差为1.12。

Conclusion: 验证了低成本成像硬件与先进计算工具结合进行非破坏性、可扩展表型分析的可行性，时空整合方法在传统分割技术失效的复杂场景中表现优异。

Abstract: The study investigates the effects of R. solani inoculation on the
germination and early development of Lactuca sativa L. seeds using a low-cost,
image-based monitoring system. Multiple cameras were deployed to continuously
capture images of the germination process in both infected and control groups.
The objective was to assess the impact of the pathogen by analyzing germination
dynamics and growth over time. To achieve this, a novel image analysis pipeline
was developed. The algorithm integrates both morphological and spatial features
to identify and quantify individual seedlings, even under complex conditions
where traditional image analyses fails. A key innovation of the method lies in
its temporal integration: each analysis step considers not only the current
status but also their developmental across prior time points. This approach
enables robust discrimination of individual seedlings, especially when
overlapping leaves significantly hinder object separation. The method
demonstrated high accuracy in seedling counting and vigor assessment, even in
challenging scenarios characterized by dense and intertwined growth. Results
confirm that R. solani infection significantly reduces germination rates and
early seedling vigor. The study also validates the feasibility of combining
low-cost imaging hardware with advanced computational tools to obtain
phenotyping data in a non-destructive and scalable manner. The temporal
integration enabled accurate quantification of germinated seeds and precise
determination of seedling emergence timing. This approach proved particularly
effective in later stages of the experiment, where conventional segmentation
techniques failed due to overlapping or intertwined seedlings, making accurate
counting. The method achieved a coefficient of determination of 0.98 and a root
mean square error (RMSE) of 1.12, demonstrating its robustness and reliability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉模型在推理和上下文学习方面落后于语言模型，这可能源于ViT训练中缺乏语义和上下文指导，需要设计语义基础的目标来缩小这一差距。

Method: 采用掩码图像建模框架，但将掩码应用于视觉对象而非随机图像块，直接建模对象作为视觉等价于单词，学习视觉元素间的全局上下文和语义。

Result: 定性和定量评估表明，对象级表示有助于学习真实世界分布，而无需像素平均捷径。在VQA、GQA、ScienceQA等任务上，多模态大语言模型展现出强大的推理和上下文理解能力。

Conclusion: 对象级编码是开发更强视觉编码器和分词器的有效方向，能够显著提升视觉模型的推理和语义理解能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in language modeling have witnessed the rise of highly
desirable emergent capabilities, such as reasoning and in-context learning.
However, vision models have yet to exhibit comparable progress in these areas.
In this paper, we argue that this gap could stem from the lack of semantic and
contextual guidance in current vision transformer (ViT) training schemes, and
such a gap can be narrowed through the design of a semantic-grounded objective.
Specifically, we notice that individual words in natural language are
inherently semantic, and modeling directly on word tokens naturally learns a
realistic distribution. In contrast, ViTs rely on spatial patchification, which
inevitably lacks semantic information. To bridge this gap, we propose to
directly model "object" as the visual equivalence of "word," pushing the model
to learn the global context and semantics among visual elements. We investigate
our hypotheses via masked image modeling (MIM), a framework where our approach
can be readily tested by applying masks to visual objects rather than random
patches. Considerable evidence from qualitative and quantitative evaluations
reveals a key finding: object-level representation alone helps to learn a
real-world distribution, whereas pixel-averaging shortcuts are often learned
without it. Moreover, further evaluations with multimodal LLMs (MLLM) on visual
question answering (VQA, GQA, ScienceQA) tasks demonstrate the strong reasoning
and contextual understanding gained with this simple objective. We hope our
study highlights the effectiveness of object-level encoding and provides a
plausible direction for developing stronger vision encoders and tokenizers.
Code and model will be publicly released. Keywords: Semantic Visual Tokenizer,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型在从参考照片生成身份一致图像时，难以准确控制年龄同时保持身份，且微调通常需要跨年龄的昂贵配对图像。

Method: 利用衰老的线性特性，引入年龄条件提示混合和基于SVDMix矩阵融合技术的年龄特定LoRA融合策略，实现中间年龄肖像的高质量生成。

Result: AgeBooth能从单张参考图像生成不同年龄段的逼真且身份一致的人脸图像，在年龄控制和视觉质量上优于先前最先进的基于编辑的方法。

Conclusion: AgeBooth提供了一种无需大量年龄标注数据的有效年龄控制解决方案，在年龄个性化生成方面表现出色。

Abstract: Recent diffusion model research focuses on generating identity-consistent
images from a reference photo, but they struggle to accurately control age
while preserving identity, and fine-tuning such models often requires costly
paired images across ages. In this paper, we propose AgeBooth, a novel
age-specific finetuning approach that can effectively enhance the age control
capability of adapterbased identity personalization models without the need for
expensive age-varied datasets. To reduce dependence on a large amount of
age-labeled data, we exploit the linear nature of aging by introducing
age-conditioned prompt blending and an age-specific LoRA fusion strategy that
leverages SVDMix, a matrix fusion technique. These techniques enable
high-quality generation of intermediate-age portraits. Our AgeBooth produces
realistic and identity-consistent face images across different ages from a
single reference image. Experiments show that AgeBooth achieves superior age
control and visual quality compared to previous state-of-the-art editing-based
methods.

Conclusion: 该方法无需手动标注，能有效提升下游任务性能，为数据增强提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Generating enough and diverse data through augmentation offers an efficient
solution to the time-consuming and labour-intensive process of collecting and
annotating pixel-wise images. Traditional data augmentation techniques often
face challenges in manipulating high-level semantic attributes, such as
materials and textures. In contrast, diffusion models offer a robust
alternative, by effectively utilizing text-to-image or image-to-image
transformation. However, existing diffusion-based methods are either
computationally expensive or compromise on performance. To address this issue,
we introduce a novel training-free pipeline that integrates pretrained
ControlNet and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to generate synthetic images
paired with pixel-level labels. This approach eliminates the need for manual
annotations and significantly improves downstream tasks. To improve the
fidelity and diversity, we add a Multi-way Prompt Generator, Mask Generator and
High-quality Image Selection module. Our results on PASCAL-5i and COCO-20i
present promising performance and outperform concurrent work for one-shot

Motivation: 现有合成图像检测工作主要关注跨生成器的泛化能力，但忽视了同样重要的跨视觉域泛化挑战。为了弥补这一差距，需要开发更全面的评估基准和方法。

Method: FusionDetect方法利用两个冻结的基础模型CLIP和Dinov2，从这两个互补模型中提取特征，构建一个能够自然适应生成器内容和设计变化的统一特征空间。

Result: 在OmniGen基准测试中，FusionDetect实现了4.48%的准确率提升，在现有基准测试中比最接近的竞争对手平均准确率高3.87%，精确度高6.13%，并且对常见图像扰动具有出色的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 不仅提出了一个顶级性能的检测器，还引入了一个新的基准和框架，用于推进通用AI图像检测的发展。

Abstract: The rapid development of generative models has made it increasingly crucial
to develop detectors that can reliably detect synthetic images. Although most
of the work has now focused on cross-generator generalization, we argue that
this viewpoint is too limited. Detecting synthetic images involves another
equally important challenge: generalization across visual domains. To bridge
this gap,we present the OmniGen Benchmark. This comprehensive evaluation
dataset incorporates 12 state-of-the-art generators, providing a more realistic
way of evaluating detector performance under realistic conditions. In addition,
we introduce a new method, FusionDetect, aimed at addressing both vectors of
generalization. FusionDetect draws on the benefits of two frozen foundation
models: CLIP & Dinov2. By deriving features from both complementary models,we
develop a cohesive feature space that naturally adapts to changes in both
thecontent and design of the generator. Our extensive experiments demonstrate
that FusionDetect delivers not only a new state-of-the-art, which is 3.87% more
accurate than its closest competitor and 6.13% more precise on average on
established benchmarks, but also achieves a 4.48% increase in accuracy on
OmniGen,along with exceptional robustness to common image perturbations. We
introduce not only a top-performing detector, but also a new benchmark and
framework for furthering universal AI image detection. The code and dataset are

Motivation: 室外LiDAR点云的手动标注成本极高且耗时，现有方法仍需人工标注。为了完全消除对标注的依赖，需要开发完全无监督的实例分割方法。

Method: 使用视觉基础模型生成初始伪标签，通过时空投票模块结合2D和3D语义进行优化，引入2D先验损失和原型对比损失进行语义监督，构建判别性特征空间。

Result: 在无监督3D实例分割中达到最先进性能，mAP达到50.95%，甚至超过了使用2D边界框监督的MWSIS方法（48.42%）。

Conclusion: ALISE证明了完全无监督的LiDAR实例分割是可行的，通过精心设计的伪标签生成和优化策略，能够超越部分监督方法的性能。

Abstract: The manual annotation of outdoor LiDAR point clouds for instance segmentation
is extremely costly and time-consuming. Current methods attempt to reduce this
burden but still rely on some form of human labeling. To completely eliminate
this dependency, we introduce ALISE, a novel framework that performs LiDAR
instance segmentation without any annotations. The central challenge is to
generate high-quality pseudo-labels in a fully unsupervised manner. Our
approach starts by employing Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), guided by text
and images, to produce initial pseudo-labels. We then refine these labels
through a dedicated spatio-temporal voting module, which combines 2D and 3D
semantics for both offline and online optimization. To achieve superior feature
learning, we further introduce two forms of semantic supervision: a set of 2D
prior-based losses that inject visual knowledge into the 3D network, and a
novel prototype-based contrastive loss that builds a discriminative feature
space by exploiting 3D semantic consistency. This comprehensive design results
in significant performance gains, establishing a new state-of-the-art for
unsupervised 3D instance segmentation. Remarkably, our approach even
outperforms MWSIS, a method that operates with supervision from ground-truth
(GT) 2D bounding boxes by a margin of 2.53% in mAP (50.95% vs. 48.42%).

Motivation: 传统视觉搜索采用多阶段级联架构，但查询图像和产品在不同阶段的表示差异导致难以在用户体验和转化率之间达到帕累托最优。

Method: 基于VRQ（视觉对齐残差量化编码）构建OneVision框架，采用多阶段语义对齐方案，在保持强视觉相似性先验的同时有效整合用户特定信息。

Result: 离线评估与在线MCA性能相当，推理效率提升21%；A/B测试显示显著提升：商品点击率+2.15%，转化率+2.27%，订单量+3.12%。

Conclusion: 以语义ID为中心的生成架构能够统一检索和个性化，同时简化服务路径。

Abstract: Traditional vision search, similar to search and recommendation systems,
follows the multi-stage cascading architecture (MCA) paradigm to balance
efficiency and conversion. Specifically, the query image undergoes feature
extraction, recall, pre-ranking, and ranking stages, ultimately presenting the
user with semantically similar products that meet their preferences. This
multi-view representation discrepancy of the same object in the query and the
optimization objective collide across these stages, making it difficult to
achieve Pareto optimality in both user experience and conversion. In this
paper, an end-to-end generative framework, OneVision, is proposed to address
these problems. OneVision builds on VRQ, a vision-aligned residual quantization
encoding, which can align the vastly different representations of an object
across multiple viewpoints while preserving the distinctive features of each
product as much as possible. Then a multi-stage semantic alignment scheme is
adopted to maintain strong visual similarity priors while effectively
incorporating user-specific information for personalized preference generation.
In offline evaluations, OneVision performs on par with online MCA, while
improving inference efficiency by 21% through dynamic pruning. In A/B tests, it
achieves significant online improvements: +2.15% item CTR, +2.27% CVR, and
+3.12% order volume. These results demonstrate that a semantic ID centric,
generative architecture can unify retrieval and personalization while
simplifying the serving pathway.

Conclusion: 所提出的方法能够有效利用多源弱标签数据训练深度学习网络，通过考虑数据源可靠性来提高模型性能。

Abstract: Deep learning has gained broad interest in remote sensing image scene
classification thanks to the effectiveness of deep neural networks in
extracting the semantics from complex data. However, deep networks require
large amounts of training samples to obtain good generalization capabilities
and are sensitive to errors in the training labels. This is a problem in remote
sensing since highly reliable labels can be obtained at high costs and in
limited amount. However, many sources of less reliable labeled data are
available, e.g., obsolete digital maps. In order to train deep networks with
larger datasets, we propose both the combination of single or multiple weak
sources of labeled data with a small but reliable dataset to generate
multisource labeled datasets and a novel training strategy where the
reliability of each source is taken in consideration. This is done by
exploiting the transition matrices describing the statistics of the errors of
each source. The transition matrices are embedded into the labels and used
during the training process to weigh each label according to the related
source. The proposed method acts as a weighting scheme at gradient level, where
each instance contributes with different weights to the optimization of
different classes. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated by
experiments on different datasets. The results proved the robustness and
capability of leveraging on unreliable source of labels of the proposed method.

Motivation: 大多数OOD检测方法将大型预训练模型视为整体编码器，仅依赖最终层表示进行检测，忽略了中间层可能包含的丰富分布偏移信号。

Method: 利用残差连接塑造的中间层表示，引入基于熵的准则自动识别提供最互补信息的层，在无需训练和OOD数据的情况下选择性整合这些中间表示。

Result: 在远OOD基准上检测准确率提升高达10%，在近OOD基准上提升超过7%，优于当前最先进的免训练方法，适用于各种模型架构和训练目标。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了中间层表示在OOD检测中的重要作用，为OOD检测研究开辟了新途径，并揭示了不同训练目标和模型架构对基于置信度的OOD检测方法的影响。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is essential for reliably deploying
machine learning models in the wild. Yet, most methods treat large pre-trained
models as monolithic encoders and rely solely on their final-layer
representations for detection. We challenge this wisdom. We reveal the
\textit{intermediate layers} of pre-trained models, shaped by residual
connections that subtly transform input projections, \textit{can} encode
\textit{surprisingly rich and diverse signals} for detecting distributional
shifts. Importantly, to exploit latent representation diversity across layers,
we introduce an entropy-based criterion to \textit{automatically} identify
layers offering the most complementary information in a training-free setting
-- \textit{without access to OOD data}. We show that selectively incorporating
these intermediate representations can increase the accuracy of OOD detection
by up to \textbf{$10\%$} in far-OOD and over \textbf{$7\%$} in near-OOD
benchmarks compared to state-of-the-art training-free methods across various
model architectures and training objectives. Our findings reveal a new avenue
for OOD detection research and uncover the impact of various training

### [41] [Rasterized Steered Mixture of Experts for Efficient 2D Image Regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05814)
*Yi-Hsin Li,Thomas Sikora,Sebastian Knorr,Mårten Sjöström*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于栅格化的优化策略，将栅格化高斯核渲染的效率与Steered Mixture of Experts的边缘感知门控机制相结合，显著加速二维图像回归任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Steered Mixture of Experts回归框架在图像重建、压缩、去噪和超分辨率方面表现出色，但其高计算成本限制了实际应用。

Method: 采用栅格化优化策略，用栅格化公式替代全局迭代优化，结合栅格化高斯核渲染效率和边缘感知门控机制。

Result: 实现了显著更快的参数更新和更内存高效的模型表示，同时保持了模型的固有稀疏性和重建质量。

Conclusion: 该方法在计算效率和重建保真度之间提供了新的平衡，支持原生超分辨率和图像去噪等应用。

Abstract: The Steered Mixture of Experts regression framework has demonstrated strong
performance in image reconstruction, compression, denoising, and
super-resolution. However, its high computational cost limits practical
applications. This work introduces a rasterization-based optimization strategy
that combines the efficiency of rasterized Gaussian kernel rendering with the
edge-aware gating mechanism of the Steered Mixture of Experts. The proposed
method is designed to accelerate two-dimensional image regression while
maintaining the model's inherent sparsity and reconstruction quality. By
replacing global iterative optimization with a rasterized formulation, the
method achieves significantly faster parameter updates and more
memory-efficient model representations. In addition, the proposed framework
supports applications such as native super-resolution and image denoising,
which are not directly achievable with standard rasterized Gaussian kernel
approaches. The combination of fast rasterized optimization with the edge-aware
structure of the Steered Mixture of Experts provides a new balance between
computational efficiency and reconstruction fidelity for two-dimensional image
processing tasks.

*Sven Koehler,Sarah Kaye Mueller,Jonathan Kiekenap,Gerald Greil,Tarique Hussain,Samir Sarikouch,Florian André,Norbert Frey,Sandy Engelhardt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种自监督深度学习方法，用于在心脏磁共振短轴和四腔长轴图像中检测五个关键帧，相比传统基于心室容积的方法，在ED和ES检测准确率上提升了30%-51%（短轴）和11%-47%（四腔长轴）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心脏磁共振是评估心功能的金标准，但个体心脏周期差异使得自动时间比较或亚相位分析变得复杂。准确检测心脏关键帧可以解决这个问题，而现有方法仅从左心室容积曲线推导收缩末期和舒张末期帧，无法深入了解心肌运动模式。

Method: 使用自监督深度学习方法，首先从图像中推导密集可变形配准场，计算一维运动描述符来捕捉全局心脏收缩和舒张模式。从这些特征曲线中，使用简单规则集确定关键帧。在三个公共多中心多疾病数据集上进行独立评估。

Result: 该方法在ED和ES检测上相比基于容积的方法，循环帧差异指标提升了30%-51%（短轴）和11%-47%（四腔长轴）。能够检测ED、ES以及心脏周期中的三个额外关键帧，平均循环帧差异低于1.31帧（短轴）和1.73帧（长轴）。

Conclusion: 该方法能够实现不受周期或相位长度影响的心脏动力学时间对齐分析，为患者间和患者内的心脏动态分析提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) is the gold standard for assessing
cardiac function, but individual cardiac cycles complicate automatic temporal
comparison or sub-phase analysis. Accurate cardiac keyframe detection can
eliminate this problem. However, automatic methods solely derive end-systole
(ES) and end-diastole (ED) frames from left ventricular volume curves, which do
not provide a deeper insight into myocardial motion. We propose a
self-supervised deep learning method detecting five keyframes in short-axis
(SAX) and four-chamber long-axis (4CH) cine CMR. Initially, dense deformable
registration fields are derived from the images and used to compute a 1D motion
descriptor, which provides valuable insights into global cardiac contraction
and relaxation patterns. From these characteristic curves, keyframes are
determined using a simple set of rules. The method was independently evaluated
for both views using three public, multicentre, multidisease datasets. M&Ms-2
(n=360) dataset was used for training and evaluation, and M&Ms (n=345) and ACDC
(n=100) datasets for repeatability control. Furthermore, generalisability to
patients with rare congenital heart defects was tested using the German
Competence Network (GCN) dataset. Our self-supervised approach achieved
improved detection accuracy by 30% - 51% for SAX and 11% - 47% for 4CH in ED
and ES, as measured by cyclic frame difference (cFD), compared with the
volume-based approach. We can detect ED and ES, as well as three additional
keyframes throughout the cardiac cycle with a mean cFD below 1.31 frames for
SAX and 1.73 for LAX. Our approach enables temporally aligned inter- and
intra-patient analysis of cardiac dynamics, irrespective of cycle or phase
lengths. GitHub repository:

*Ruyang Liu,Shangkun Sun,Haoran Tang,Ge Li,Wei Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Flow4Agent是一个利用光流运动先验来增强LLM长视频理解的新框架，通过时间粒度优化和运动token剪枝来减少视频冗余，在多个视频MLLM基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长视频理解面临时空内容冗余和MLLM上下文长度有限的挑战，现有方法主要依赖CLIP模型作为语义先验，而忽略了运动信息的重要性。

Method: 提出Flow4Agent框架，包含两个核心模块：时间粒度优化(TGO)利用粗粒度光流先验分组相似视觉内容，再用语义先验过滤无关场景；运动token剪枝(MTP)利用细粒度光流信息剪枝高冗余视频token。

Result: 在多个视频MLLM基准测试中表现优异，特别是在小时级视频理解任务上：Video-MME达到64.7%，MLVU达到71.4%，LongVideoBench达到60.4%。

Conclusion: Flow4Agent通过引入光流运动先验有效解决了长视频理解中的冗余问题，显著提升了视频MLLM的性能，特别是在长视频任务上表现突出。

Abstract: Long-form video understanding has always been a challenging problem due to
the significant redundancy in both temporal and spatial contents. This
challenge is further exacerbated by the limited context length of Multimodal
Large Language Models (MLLMs). To address this issue, many previous works have
attempted to extract key video information, where the "key" is typically
semantic-aware and heavily dependent on the CLIP model as prior. In this paper,
we propose Flow4Agent, a novel framework that pioneeringly incorporates motion
priors from optical flow to facilitate LLM-based long video understanding.
Flow4Agent mitigates the redundancy in long videos at both temporal and spatial
levels through two core modules: Temporal Granularity Optimization (TGO)
adaptively refines framelevel hierarchies, which first leverages coarse flow
priors to group similar visual contents and then applies semantic priors to
filter out highly irrelevant scene information. Motion Token Pruning (MTP)
further refines the intra-frame visual representations, pruning high-redundancy
video tokens using fine-grained optical flow information. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our Flow4Agent outperforms existing methods across a wide
range of video MLLM benchmarks, especially for hour-level video understanding
tasks, achieving 64.7% on Video-MME, 71.4% on MLVU and 60.4% on LongVideoBench.

Conclusion: acia-workflows平台成功将深度学习工具整合到易用工作流中，为活细胞成像数据的自动化分析提供了可访问、可重现和可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Live-cell imaging (LCI) technology enables the detailed spatio-temporal
characterization of living cells at the single-cell level, which is critical
for advancing research in the life sciences, from biomedical applications to
bioprocessing. High-throughput setups with tens to hundreds of parallel cell
cultivations offer the potential for robust and reproducible insights. However,
these insights are obscured by the large amount of LCI data recorded per
experiment. Recent advances in state-of-the-art deep learning methods for cell
segmentation and tracking now enable the automated analysis of such large data
volumes, offering unprecedented opportunities to systematically study
single-cell dynamics. The next key challenge lies in integrating these powerful
tools into accessible, flexible, and user-friendly workflows that support
routine application in biological research. In this work, we present
acia-workflows, a platform that combines three key components: (1) the
Automated live-Cell Imaging Analysis (acia) Python library, which supports the
modular design of image analysis pipelines offering eight deep learning
segmentation and tracking approaches; (2) workflows that assemble the image
analysis pipeline, its software dependencies, documentation, and visualizations
into a single Jupyter Notebook, leading to accessible, reproducible and
scalable analysis workflows; and (3) a collection of application workflows
showcasing the analysis and customization capabilities in real-world
applications. Specifically, we present three workflows to investigate various
types of microfluidic LCI experiments ranging from growth rate comparisons to
precise, minute-resolution quantitative analyses of individual dynamic cells
responses to changing oxygen conditions. Our collection of more than ten
application workflows is open source and publicly available at

TL;DR: BioAutoML-NAS是一种基于多模态数据的自动机器学习模型，通过神经架构搜索和交替双层优化策略，在昆虫分类任务中实现了高精度性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 昆虫分类对农业管理和生态研究至关重要，但由于昆虫特征的复杂性、类别不平衡和大规模数据集等问题，该任务仍然具有挑战性。

Method: 使用多模态数据（图像和元数据），应用神经架构搜索自动学习每个单元内的最佳操作，通过多模态融合模块结合图像嵌入和元数据，采用交替双层优化训练策略，并使用零操作移除不重要连接。

Result: 在BIOSCAN-5M数据集上达到96.81%准确率、97.46%精确率、96.81%召回率和97.05% F1分数，分别优于现有最佳方法约16%、10%和8%；在Insects-1M数据集上达到93.25%准确率。

Conclusion: BioAutoML-NAS提供了准确、可靠的昆虫分类，能够支持现代可持续农业的发展。

Abstract: Insect classification is important for agricultural management and ecological
research, as it directly affects crop health and production. However, this task
remains challenging due to the complex characteristics of insects, class
imbalance, and large-scale datasets. To address these issues, we propose
BioAutoML-NAS, the first BioAutoML model using multimodal data, including
images, and metadata, which applies neural architecture search (NAS) for images
to automatically learn the best operations for each connection within each
cell. Multiple cells are stacked to form the full network, each extracting
detailed image feature representations. A multimodal fusion module combines
image embeddings with metadata, allowing the model to use both visual and
categorical biological information to classify insects. An alternating bi-level
optimization training strategy jointly updates network weights and architecture
parameters, while zero operations remove less important connections, producing
sparse, efficient, and high-performing architectures. Extensive evaluation on
the BIOSCAN-5M dataset demonstrates that BioAutoML-NAS achieves 96.81%
accuracy, 97.46% precision, 96.81% recall, and a 97.05% F1 score, outperforming
state-of-the-art transfer learning, transformer, AutoML, and NAS methods by
approximately 16%, 10%, and 8% respectively. Further validation on the
Insects-1M dataset obtains 93.25% accuracy, 93.71% precision, 92.74% recall,
and a 93.22% F1 score. These results demonstrate that BioAutoML-NAS provides
accurate, confident insect classification that supports modern sustainable
farming.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉自回归模型在图像生成方面带来革命性进展，但其离散token预测的生成方式为合成图像检测带来新挑战，需要专门的方法来识别其独特的向量量化表示特征。

Method: 提出离散分布差异感知量化误差(D³QE)方法，构建动态码本频率统计的transformer，在注意力机制中融合语义特征和量化误差潜在表示。

Conclusion: D³QE方法能有效检测自回归生成的图像，利用其独特的码本频率分布偏差和量化误差模式，为新一代生成模型的检测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The emergence of visual autoregressive (AR) models has revolutionized image
generation while presenting new challenges for synthetic image detection.
Unlike previous GAN or diffusion-based methods, AR models generate images
through discrete token prediction, exhibiting both marked improvements in image
synthesis quality and unique characteristics in their vector-quantized
representations. In this paper, we propose to leverage Discrete Distribution
Discrepancy-aware Quantization Error (D$^3$QE) for autoregressive-generated
image detection that exploits the distinctive patterns and the frequency
distribution bias of the codebook existing in real and fake images. We
introduce a discrete distribution discrepancy-aware transformer that integrates
dynamic codebook frequency statistics into its attention mechanism, fusing
semantic features and quantization error latent. To evaluate our method, we
construct a comprehensive dataset termed ARForensics covering 7 mainstream
visual AR models. Experiments demonstrate superior detection accuracy and
strong generalization of D$^3$QE across different AR models, with robustness to
real-world perturbations. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出弱监督上下文学习(WS-ICL)，使用弱提示(如边界框或点)替代密集标签，显著减少医学图像分割的标注成本，同时保持与常规ICL模型相当的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有通用医学图像分割模型(交互式和上下文学习模型)虽然泛化能力强，但需要大量标注。交互式模型需要对每张图像重复用户提示，而ICL依赖密集的像素级标签，标注成本高。

Method: 提出WS-ICL新范式，利用弱提示(边界框或点)作为上下文，替代密集标签，无需为所有图像重复用户提示或精细掩码。

Result: 在三个保留基准测试中，WS-ICL在显著降低标注成本的情况下，实现了与常规ICL模型相当的性能，在交互范式下也极具竞争力。

Conclusion: WS-ICL是朝着更高效、统一的医学图像分割通用模型迈出的有希望的一步，代码和模型已公开。

Abstract: Universal models for medical image segmentation, such as interactive and
in-context learning (ICL) models, offer strong generalization but require
extensive annotations. Interactive models need repeated user prompts for each
image, while ICL relies on dense, pixel-level labels. To address this, we
propose Weakly Supervised In-Context Learning (WS-ICL), a new ICL paradigm that
leverages weak prompts (e.g., bounding boxes or points) instead of dense labels
for context. This approach significantly reduces annotation effort by
eliminating the need for fine-grained masks and repeated user prompting for all
images. We evaluated the proposed WS-ICL model on three held-out benchmarks.
Experimental results demonstrate that WS-ICL achieves performance comparable to
regular ICL models at a significantly lower annotation cost. In addition,
WS-ICL is highly competitive even under the interactive paradigm. These
findings establish WS-ICL as a promising step toward more efficient and unified
universal models for medical image segmentation. Our code and model are
publicly available at https://github.com/jiesihu/Weak-ICL.

Motivation: 现有的工业异常检测基准（如MVTec-AD和VisA）主要针对制造场景，在高度控制的姿态和有限的对象类别下已达到饱和状态。而零售物流中的异常检测面临新的挑战，特别是在对象姿态和外观的多样性和可变性方面。

Conclusion: 该大规模数据集为零售物流异常检测设立了一个新的基准，鼓励未来研究解决这一具有挑战性的问题。数据集已在指定网站开放下载。

Abstract: We present a novel large-scale dataset for defect detection in a logistics
setting. Recent work on industrial anomaly detection has primarily focused on
manufacturing scenarios with highly controlled poses and a limited number of
object categories. Existing benchmarks like MVTec-AD [6] and VisA [33] have
reached saturation, with state-of-the-art methods achieving up to 99.9% AUROC
scores. In contrast to manufacturing, anomaly detection in retail logistics
faces new challenges, particularly in the diversity and variability of object
pose and appearance. Leading anomaly detection methods fall short when applied
to this new setting. To bridge this gap, we introduce a new benchmark that
overcomes the current limitations of existing datasets. With over 230,000
images (and more than 29,000 defective instances), it is 40 times larger than
MVTec-AD and contains more than 48,000 distinct objects. To validate the
difficulty of the problem, we conduct an extensive evaluation of multiple
state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods, demonstrating that they do not
surpass 56.96% AUROC on our dataset. Further qualitative analysis confirms that
existing methods struggle to leverage normal samples under heavy pose and
appearance variation. With our large-scale dataset, we set a new benchmark and
encourage future research towards solving this challenging problem in retail
logistics anomaly detection. The dataset is available for download under

TL;DR: 本文首次系统研究了医学影像中的token mixers，在MetaFormer架构下比较了池化、卷积和注意力机制，发现在分类任务中低复杂度token mixers足够，而在分割任务中卷积的局部归纳偏置至关重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MetaFormer架构在自然图像领域已被广泛研究，但在医学影像中的应用仍然稀缺，且现有工作很少比较不同的token mixers，可能忽略了更适合医学影像的设计选择。

Method: 在MetaFormer架构中系统分析池化、卷积和注意力三种token mixers，评估涵盖8个医学影像数据集，包括图像分类和语义分割任务，并研究了从自然图像预训练权重的迁移效果。

Result: 分类任务中，低复杂度token mixers（如分组卷积或池化）表现足够；预训练权重在新token mixers中仍然有效。分割任务中，卷积token mixers的局部归纳偏置至关重要，分组卷积成为首选，能减少运行时间和参数数量。

Conclusion: 医学影像任务中token mixer的选择取决于任务类型：分类任务适合低复杂度设计，分割任务需要卷积的局部归纳偏置，分组卷积在性能和效率间取得良好平衡。

Abstract: The generalization of the Transformer architecture via MetaFormer has
reshaped our understanding of its success in computer vision. By replacing
self-attention with simpler token mixers, MetaFormer provides strong baselines
for vision tasks. However, while extensively studied on natural image datasets,
its use in medical imaging remains scarce, and existing works rarely compare
different token mixers, potentially overlooking more suitable designs choices.
In this work, we present the first comprehensive study of token mixers for
medical imaging. We systematically analyze pooling-, convolution-, and
attention-based token mixers within the MetaFormer architecture on image
classification (global prediction task) and semantic segmentation (dense
prediction task). Our evaluation spans eight datasets covering diverse
modalities and common challenges in the medical domain. Given the prevalence of
pretraining from natural images to mitigate medical data scarcity, we also
examine transferring pretrained weights to new token mixers. Our results show
that, for classification, low-complexity token mixers (e.g. grouped convolution
or pooling) are sufficient, aligning with findings on natural images.
Pretrained weights remain useful despite the domain gap introduced by the new
token mixer. For segmentation, we find that the local inductive bias of
convolutional token mixers is essential. Grouped convolutions emerge as the
preferred choice, as they reduce runtime and parameter count compared to
standard convolutions, while the MetaFormer's channel-MLPs already provide the
necessary cross-channel interactions. Our code is available on GitHub.

Abstract: Low-light image enhancement (LLIE) is vital for safety-critical applications
such as surveillance, autonomous navigation, and medical imaging, where
visibility degradation can impair downstream task performance. Recently,
diffusion models have emerged as a promising generative paradigm for LLIE due
to their capacity to model complex image distributions via iterative denoising.
This survey provides an up-to-date critical analysis of diffusion models for
LLIE, distinctively featuring an in-depth comparative performance evaluation
against Generative Adversarial Network and Transformer-based state-of-the-art
methods, a thorough examination of practical deployment challenges, and a
forward-looking perspective on the role of emerging paradigms like foundation
models. We propose a multi-perspective taxonomy encompassing six categories:
Intrinsic Decomposition, Spectral & Latent, Accelerated, Guided, Multimodal,
and Autonomous; that map enhancement methods across physical priors,
conditioning schemes, and computational efficiency. Our taxonomy is grounded in
a hybrid view of both the model mechanism and the conditioning signals. We
evaluate qualitative failure modes, benchmark inconsistencies, and trade-offs
between interpretability, generalization, and inference efficiency. We also
discuss real-world deployment constraints (e.g., memory, energy use) and
ethical considerations. This survey aims to guide the next generation of
diffusion-based LLIE research by highlighting trends and surfacing open
research questions, including novel conditioning, real-time adaptation, and the
potential of foundation models.

Motivation: 传统形态成分分析(MCA)使用预定义的不相干字典，但缺乏对视频动态内容变化的自适应能力。本文旨在开发能够根据视频场景内容动态变化自适应调整表示的方法。

Method: 通过动态模式分解特征值聚类技术，获得数据驱动的MCA字典，扩展了传统MCA算法。提出的DMCA方法能够自适应地分离视频中不同的形态结构。

Result: 在Adobe 240fps数据集上的去噪应用显示DMCA有效，能增强微弱目标的信噪比，并成功在逆合成孔径雷达图像中分离自行车与风杂波。

Conclusion: DMCA通过数据驱动的字典学习方法，显著提升了视频形态成分分离的性能，在多个应用场景中表现出色。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel methodology of adapting the representation of
videos based on the dynamics of their scene content variation. In particular,
we demonstrate how the clustering of dynamic mode decomposition eigenvalues can
be leveraged to learn an adaptive video representation for separating
structurally distinct morphologies of a video. We extend the morphological
component analysis (MCA) algorithm, which uses multiple predefined incoherent
dictionaries and a sparsity prior to separate distinct sources in signals, by
introducing our novel eigenspace clustering technique to obtain data-driven MCA
dictionaries, which we call dynamic morphological component analysis (DMCA).
After deriving our novel algorithm, we offer a motivational example of DMCA
applied to a still image, then demonstrate DMCA's effectiveness in denoising
applications on videos from the Adobe 240fps dataset. Afterwards, we provide an
example of DMCA enhancing the signal-to-noise ratio of a faint target summed
with a sea state, and conclude the paper by applying DMCA to separate a bicycle
from wind clutter in inverse synthetic aperture radar images.

Result: 在多个最先进水印方案上评估，攻击后水印恢复率接近零，同时保持再生图像的高视觉保真度。

Conclusion: 当前鲁棒水印技术在面对生成模型攻击时存在根本性漏洞，在生成AI时代需要新的水印策略。

Abstract: Robust invisible watermarking aims to embed hidden information into images
such that the watermark can survive various image manipulations. However, the
rise of powerful diffusion-based image generation and editing techniques poses
a new threat to these watermarking schemes. In this paper, we present a
theoretical study and method demonstrating that diffusion models can
effectively break robust image watermarks that were designed to resist
conventional perturbations. We show that a diffusion-driven ``image
regeneration'' process can erase embedded watermarks while preserving
perceptual image content. We further introduce a novel guided diffusion attack
that explicitly targets the watermark signal during generation, significantly
degrading watermark detectability. Theoretically, we prove that as an image
undergoes sufficient diffusion-based transformation, the mutual information
between the watermarked image and the embedded watermark payload vanishes,
resulting in decoding failure. Experimentally, we evaluate our approach on
multiple state-of-the-art watermarking schemes (including the deep
learning-based methods StegaStamp, TrustMark, and VINE) and demonstrate
near-zero watermark recovery rates after attack, while maintaining high visual
fidelity of the regenerated images. Our findings highlight a fundamental
vulnerability in current robust watermarking techniques against generative
model-based attacks, underscoring the need for new watermarking strategies in
the era of generative AI.

Abstract: This study examines the use of social media and news images to detect and
measure hailstones, utilizing pre-trained multimodal large language models. The
dataset for this study comprises 474 crowdsourced images of hailstones from
documented hail events in Austria, which occurred between January 2022 and
September 2024. These hailstones have maximum diameters ranging from 2 to 11cm.
We estimate the hail diameters and compare four different models utilizing
one-stage and two-stage prompting strategies. The latter utilizes additional
size cues from reference objects, such as human hands, within the image. Our
results show that pretrained models already have the potential to measure
hailstone diameters from images with an average mean absolute error of 1.12cm
for the best model. In comparison to a single-stage prompt, two-stage prompting
improves the reliability of most models. Our study suggests that these
off-the-shelf models, even without fine-tuning, can complement traditional hail
sensors by extracting meaningful and spatially dense information from social
media imagery, enabling faster and more detailed assessments of severe weather
events. The automated real-time image harvesting from social media and other
sources remains an open task, but it will make our approach directly applicable
to future hail events.

Motivation: 在持续学习环境中生成准确连贯的图像描述面临灾难性遗忘和视觉概念与语言对齐困难的挑战。

Method: 基于预训练的ViT-GPT-2架构，结合交叉熵损失与三个额外组件：基于提示的余弦相似度损失、CLIP风格损失和语言引导对比损失。

Result: 该方法缓解了灾难性遗忘，在语义描述对齐方面优于现有最先进方法，且推理时无需额外开销或提示。

Conclusion: 提出的多损失框架能有效解决持续图像描述中的关键挑战，实现更好的语义对齐和遗忘缓解。

Abstract: Generating accurate and coherent image captions in a continual learning
setting remains a major challenge due to catastrophic forgetting and the
difficulty of aligning evolving visual concepts with language over time. In
this work, we propose a novel multi-loss framework for continual image
captioning that integrates semantic guidance through prompt-based continual
learning and contrastive alignment. Built upon a pretrained ViT-GPT-2 backbone,
our approach combines standard cross-entropy loss with three additional
components: (1) a prompt-based cosine similarity loss that aligns image
embeddings with synthetically constructed prompts encoding objects, attributes,
and actions; (2) a CLIP-style loss that promotes alignment between image
embeddings and target caption embedding; and (3) a language-guided contrastive
loss that employs a triplet loss to enhance class-level discriminability
between tasks. Notably, our approach introduces no additional overhead at
inference time and requires no prompts during caption generation. We find that
this approach mitigates catastrophic forgetting, while achieving better
semantic caption alignment compared to state-of-the-art methods. The code can

TL;DR: 通用实例搜索模型在犯罪调查中能大幅减少分析监控录像的人工成本，但研究发现这些模型存在意外涌现能力：即使在没有人类主体的数据集上训练，也能识别特定个体。作者评估了两种技术防护措施（索引排除和混淆损失），发现结合使用可将人员重识别准确率降至2%以下，同时保持82%的非人物体检索性能。但防护措施存在漏洞，突显了AI治理与数据保护交叉领域的监管问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用实例搜索模型在犯罪调查中有重要应用价值，但研究发现这些模型存在意外涌现的人员识别能力，即使在没有人类主体的数据集上训练也能识别特定个体，这引发了关于个人数据识别和画像的担忧。目前缺乏明确的去标识化标准，需要研究技术防护措施来限制模型的人员重识别能力。

Method: 评估了两种技术防护措施：索引排除（index exclusion）和混淆损失（confusion loss）。通过实验测试这些方法在限制人员重识别能力方面的效果，同时评估对非人物体检索性能的影响。

Result: 结合使用索引排除和混淆损失两种方法，可以将人员重识别准确率降低到2%以下，同时保持82%的非人物体检索性能。但研究发现这些防护措施存在关键漏洞，包括可能通过部分人物图像来规避防护。

Conclusion: 研究结果突显了AI治理与数据保护交叉领域的紧迫监管问题：如何分类和监管具有涌现识别能力的系统？在看似良性的应用中，应该要求什么技术标准来防止识别能力的产生？

Abstract: Generic instance search models can dramatically reduce the manual effort
required to analyze vast surveillance footage during criminal investigations by
retrieving specific objects of interest to law enforcement. However, our
research reveals an unintended emergent capability: through overlearning, these
models can single out specific individuals even when trained on datasets
without human subjects. This capability raises concerns regarding
identification and profiling of individuals based on their personal data, while
there is currently no clear standard on how de-identification can be achieved.
We evaluate two technical safeguards to curtail a model's person
re-identification capacity: index exclusion and confusion loss. Our experiments
demonstrate that combining these approaches can reduce person re-identification
accuracy to below 2% while maintaining 82% of retrieval performance for
non-person objects. However, we identify critical vulnerabilities in these
mitigations, including potential circumvention using partial person images.
These findings highlight urgent regulatory questions at the intersection of AI
governance and data protection: How should we classify and regulate systems
with emergent identification capabilities? And what technical standards should
be required to prevent identification capabilities from developing in seemingly
benign applications?

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在长视频理解中面临两个关键问题：1) 大量冗余信息干扰；2) 难以动态适应复杂层次结构并准确识别关键帧。

Method: 提出VideoMiner方法，迭代分割、描述和聚类长视频形成层次树结构；引入T-GRPO（基于树的组相对策略优化）强化学习方法，结合时空信息和问题指导来探索VideoMiner。

Result: 在所有长视频理解任务中取得优越性能，模型自发生成推理链，树生长辅助素动态调整扩展深度，获得准确性和效率提升。

Conclusion: VideoMiner通过层次树结构和T-GRPO强化学习有效解决了长视频理解的关键挑战，实现了准确高效的关键帧识别和视频理解。

Abstract: Understanding hour-long videos with multi-modal large language models
(MM-LLMs) enriches the landscape of human-centered AI applications. However,
for end-to-end video understanding with LLMs, uniformly sampling video frames
results in LLMs being overwhelmed by a vast amount of irrelevant information as
video length increases. Existing hierarchical key frame extraction methods
improve the accuracy of video understanding but still face two critical
challenges. 1) How can the interference of extensive redundant information in
long videos be mitigated? 2) How can a model dynamically adapt to complex
hierarchical structures while accurately identifying key frames? To address
these issues, we propose VideoMiner, which iteratively segments, captions, and
clusters long videos, forming a hierarchical tree structure. The proposed
VideoMiner progresses from long videos to events to frames while preserving
temporal coherence, effectively addressing the first challenge. To precisely
locate key frames, we introduce T-GRPO, a tree-based group relative policy
optimization in reinforcement learning method that guides the exploration of
the VideoMiner. The proposed T-GRPO is specifically designed for tree
structures, integrating spatiotemporal information at the event level while
being guided by the question, thus solving the second challenge. We achieve
superior performance in all long-video understanding tasks and uncover several
interesting insights. Our proposed T-GRPO surprisingly incentivizes the model
to spontaneously generate a reasoning chain. Additionally, the designed tree
growth auxin dynamically adjusts the expansion depth, obtaining accuracy and
efficiency gains. The code is publicly available at

Motivation: 现有3D人脸建模方法依赖3D可变形模型，限制了表示能力；基于优化的方法质量高但计算昂贵。需要一种既能高质量重建又保持效率的方法。

Method: 扩展学习顶点下降(LVD)方法，集成逐顶点神经场优化与动态预测3D关键点的全局结构指导，使用相对空间编码迭代优化网格顶点，无需密集3D监督。

Result: 在单视角设置中达到最先进性能，在多视角场景中保持高度竞争力，同时显著减少推理时间。

Conclusion: GLVD实现了表达性强且适应性好的几何重建，同时保持了计算效率，为3D人脸重建提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Existing 3D face modeling methods usually depend on 3D Morphable Models,
which inherently constrain the representation capacity to fixed shape priors.
Optimization-based approaches offer high-quality reconstructions but tend to be
computationally expensive. In this work, we introduce GLVD, a hybrid method for
3D face reconstruction from few-shot images that extends Learned Vertex Descent
(LVD) by integrating per-vertex neural field optimization with global
structural guidance from dynamically predicted 3D keypoints. By incorporating
relative spatial encoding, GLVD iteratively refines mesh vertices without
requiring dense 3D supervision. This enables expressive and adaptable geometry
reconstruction while maintaining computational efficiency. GLVD achieves
state-of-the-art performance in single-view settings and remains highly
competitive in multi-view scenarios, all while substantially reducing inference
time.

TL;DR: 将医学领域专用视觉语言模型MedFlamingo与PPO结合，在腹腔镜手术任务中显著提升性能，相比标准视觉PPO和OpenFlamingo PPO有显著改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于视觉观察的机器人腹腔镜手术任务中，视觉PPO面临的挑战：高维视觉输入、奖励稀疏性以及从原始视觉数据中提取任务相关特征的困难。

Method: 集成MedFlamingo（医学领域专用视觉语言模型）与PPO算法，每回合处理一次任务观察和指令以生成高级规划令牌，将医学专业知识与实时视觉反馈高效结合。

Result: 在LapGym的五个腹腔镜手术任务环境中，MedFlamingo PPO表现优于基线方法，收敛速度更快，所有环境任务成功率超过70%，相比基线改进幅度为66.67%到1114.29%。

Conclusion: 专业医学知识在机器人手术规划和决策中具有重要价值，MedFlamingo PPO方法有效提升了手术任务的性能表现。

Abstract: Vision-based Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) struggles with visual
observation-based robotic laparoscopic surgical tasks due to the
high-dimensional nature of visual input, the sparsity of rewards in surgical
environments, and the difficulty of extracting task-relevant features from raw
visual data. We introduce a simple approach integrating MedFlamingo, a medical
domain-specific Vision-Language Model, with PPO. Our method is evaluated on
five diverse laparoscopic surgery task environments in LapGym, using only
endoscopic visual observations. MedFlamingo PPO outperforms and converges
faster compared to both standard vision-based PPO and OpenFlamingo PPO
baselines, achieving task success rates exceeding 70% across all environments,
with improvements ranging from 66.67% to 1114.29% compared to baseline. By
processing task observations and instructions once per episode to generate
high-level planning tokens, our method efficiently combines medical expertise
with real-time visual feedback. Our results highlight the value of specialized
medical knowledge in robotic surgical planning and decision-making.

TL;DR: CAPTCHA被用作评估视觉语言模型空间推理能力的基准。研究发现逐步推理对解决CAPTCHA至关重要，但当前商业模型表现不佳（准确率约21.9%）。作者提出CAPTCHA-X基准和基于推理的VLM框架，将准确率提升至83.9%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CAPTCHA作为区分人类与机器人的工具，已成为评估视觉语言模型空间推理能力的现实基准。当前商业VLMs在解决这类高难度空间推理任务时表现不佳，突显了推理能力的不足。

Method: 引入CAPTCHA-X基准，包含7类CAPTCHA的逐步推理解决方案和标注。提出基于推理的VLM代理框架，利用模型固有推理能力。定义了5个面向推理的评估指标。

Result: 提出的方法在5种高难度CAPTCHA类型上达到最先进性能，平均解决准确率为83.9%，显著超越现有基线（约21.9%）。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了当前模型的局限性，强调了推理能力在推进视觉空间挑战中的重要性。逐步推理能显著提升模型解决复杂空间任务的能力。

Abstract: CAPTCHA, originally designed to distinguish humans from robots, has evolved
into a real-world benchmark for assessing the spatial reasoning capabilities of
vision-language models. In this work, we first show that step-by-step reasoning
is crucial for vision-language models (VLMs) to solve CAPTCHAs, which represent
high-difficulty spatial reasoning tasks, and that current commercial
vision-language models still struggle with such reasoning. In particular, we
observe that most commercial VLMs (e.g., Gemini, Claude, GPT, etc.) fail to
effectively solve CAPTCHAs and thus achieve low accuracy (around 21.9 percent).
However, our findings indicate that requiring the model to perform step-by-step
reasoning before generating the final coordinates can significantly enhance its
solving accuracy, underscoring the severity of the gap. To systematically study
this issue, we introduce CAPTCHA-X, the first real-world CAPTCHA benchmark with
reasoning, covering seven categories of CAPTCHAs (such as Gobang, hCaptcha,
etc.) with step-by-step action solutions and grounding annotations. We further
define five reasoning-oriented metrics that enable a comprehensive evaluation
of models reasoning capabilities. To validate the effectiveness of reasoning,
we also propose a general agentic VLM-based framework that incorporates the
models inherent reasoning abilities. Our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance across five high-difficulty CAPTCHA types, with an average solving
accuracy of 83.9 percent, substantially surpassing existing baselines. These
results reveal the limitations of current models and highlight the importance
of reasoning in advancing visual-spatial challenges in the future.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合注意力图和统计过滤的方法，为Vision Transformers生成更忠实和可解释的解释，并在多个数据集上优于或与现有方法相当。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的ViT解释方法主要依赖注意力权重，但会产生噪声图，因为注意力捕捉的是每层内的token间交互。虽然已有方法结合了MLP块，但作者认为注意力在适当过滤后仍然是宝贵且可解释的信号。

Method: 将注意力图与统计过滤相结合，去除噪声或无信息模式，生成更忠实的解释。还扩展了类特定变体以产生区分性解释。

Result: 在多个数据集上的评估表明，该方法能产生更清晰和可解释的图。除了基于扰动的忠实度指标外，还结合人类注视数据评估与人类感知的一致性。

Conclusion: 该方法在多个数据集上始终优于或与最先进方法相当，同时保持高效和人类可理解性。

Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) has become increasingly important with the rise of large
transformer models, yet many explanation methods designed for CNNs transfer
poorly to Vision Transformers (ViTs). Existing ViT explanations often rely on
attention weights, which tend to yield noisy maps as they capture
token-to-token interactions within each layer.While attribution methods
incorporating MLP blocks have been proposed, we argue that attention remains a
valuable and interpretable signal when properly filtered. We propose a method
that combines attention maps with a statistical filtering, initially proposed
for CNNs, to remove noisy or uninformative patterns and produce more faithful
explanations. We further extend our approach with a class-specific variant that
yields discriminative explanations. Evaluation against popular state-of-the-art
methods demonstrates that our approach produces sharper and more interpretable
maps. In addition to perturbation-based faithfulness metrics, we incorporate
human gaze data to assess alignment with human perception, arguing that human
interpretability remains essential for XAI. Across multiple datasets, our
approach consistently outperforms or is comparable to the SOTA methods while
remaining efficient and human plausible.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然Chain-of-Thought机制在文本任务中提升了推理能力，但在视频理解中的应用效果不佳，经常产生误导性的内部独白，导致视觉细节幻觉和正确直觉被覆盖，这种现象称为"视觉思维漂移"。

Method: 提出了Visual Evidence Reward强化学习框架，明确奖励生成可验证地基于视觉证据的推理轨迹，通过贝叶斯视角解释思维漂移现象。

Result: 在10个多样化的视频理解基准测试中，Video-VER框架持续取得最佳性能，证明了该方法在视频推理中的有效性。

Conclusion: 这项工作揭示了视频中心推理的独特挑战，鼓励开发能够稳健地将推理基于视觉证据的AI系统，让多模态模型不仅"在回答前思考"，还要"在思考时观看"。

Abstract: Video reasoning, the task of enabling machines to infer from dynamic visual
content through multi-step logic, is crucial for advanced AI. While the
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) mechanism has enhanced reasoning in text-based tasks,
its application to video understanding remains underexplored. This paper
presents a systematic analysis revealing that CoT often degrades performance in
video reasoning, generating verbose but misleading internal monologues, and
leading to hallucinated visual details and overridden correct intuitions - a
phenomenon we term "visual thinking drift". We explain this drift through a
Bayesian lens, positing that CoT traces often diverge from actual visual
evidence, instead amplifying internal biases or language priors, causing models
to storytell rather than engage in grounded reasoning. To counteract this, we
introduce Visual Evidence Reward (VER), a novel reinforcement learning
framework that explicitly rewards the generation of reasoning traces that are
verifiably grounded in visual evidence. Comprehensive evaluation across 10
diverse video understanding benchmarks demonstrates that our Video-VER
consistently achieves top performance. Our work sheds light on the distinct
challenges of video-centric reasoning and encourages the development of AI that
robustly grounds its inferences in visual evidence - for large multimodal
models that not only "think before answering", but also "see while thinking".

Abstract: Despite the success of advanced segmentation frameworks such as
TotalSegmentator (TS), accurate segmentations of the left atrial appendage

challenge in medical imaging. In this work, we present the first open-source,
anatomically coherent dataset of curated, high-resolution segmentations for
these structures, supplemented with whole-heart labels produced by TS on the
publicly available ImageCAS dataset consisting of 1000 cardiac computed

novel approaches to the analysis of LAA morphology.
  LAA segmentations on ImageCAS were generated using a state-of-the-art
segmentation framework developed specifically for high resolution LAA
segmentation. We trained the network on a large private dataset with manual
annotations provided by medical readers guided by a trained cardiologist and
transferred the model to ImageCAS data. CA labels were improved from the
original ImageCAS annotations, while PV segmentations were refined from TS
outputs. In addition, we provide a list of scans from ImageCAS that contains
common data flaws such as step artefacts, LAAs extending beyond the scanner's

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验证明了所提算法的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的模型能够紧凑地表征高光谱图像的多级先验，在张量框架下有效解决了高光谱图像超分辨率问题。

Abstract: Fusing a hyperspectral image with a multispectral image acquired over the
same scene, \textit{i.e.}, hyperspectral image super-resolution, has become a
popular computational way to access the latent high-spatial-spectral-resolution
image. To date, a variety of fusion methods have been proposed, among which the
tensor-based ones have testified that multiple priors, such as multidimensional
low-rankness and spatial total variation at multiple levels, effectively drive
the fusion process. However, existing tensor-based models can only effectively
leverage one or two priors at one or two levels, since simultaneously
incorporating multi-level priors inevitably increases model complexity. This
introduces challenges in both balancing the weights of different priors and
optimizing multi-block structures. Concerning this, we present a novel
hyperspectral super-resolution model compactly characterizing these multi-level
priors of hyperspectral images within the tensor framework. Firstly, the
proposed model decouples the spectral low-rankness and spatial priors by
casting the latent high-spatial-spectral-resolution image into spectral
subspace and spatial maps via block term decomposition. Secondly, these spatial
maps are stacked as the spatial tensor encoding the high-order spatial
low-rankness and smoothness priors, which are co-modeled via the proposed
non-convex mode-shuffled tensor correlated total variation. Finally, we draw
inspiration from the linearized alternating direction method of multipliers to
design an efficient algorithm to optimize the resulting model, theoretically
proving its Karush-Kuhn-Tucker convergence under mild conditions. Experiments
on multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.
The code implementation will be available from https://github.com/WongYinJ.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前生存分析模型难以解释，限制了在临床环境中的应用。传统原型学习方法关注局部相似性和静态匹配，忽视了肿瘤的广泛背景，且缺乏与基因组数据的强语义对齐。

Method: 建立统一特征原型空间，整合WSI的全局和局部特征与基因组数据。包括三个创新：稳健表型表示、指数原型更新策略(EMA ProtoUp)和分层原型匹配方案。

Result: 在四个公开癌症数据集上的综合评估表明，该方法在准确性和互操作性方面均优于当前领先的单模态和多模态生存预测技术。

Conclusion: FeatProto为关键医疗应用中的原型学习提供了新视角，显著提升了癌症生存预测的准确性和可解释性。

Abstract: Survival analysis plays a vital role in making clinical decisions. However,
the models currently in use are often difficult to interpret, which reduces
their usefulness in clinical settings. Prototype learning presents a potential
solution, yet traditional methods focus on local similarities and static
matching, neglecting the broader tumor context and lacking strong semantic
alignment with genomic data. To overcome these issues, we introduce an
innovative prototype-based multimodal framework, FeatProto, aimed at enhancing
cancer survival prediction by addressing significant limitations in current
prototype learning methodologies within pathology. Our framework establishes a
unified feature prototype space that integrates both global and local features
of whole slide images (WSI) with genomic profiles. This integration facilitates
traceable and interpretable decision-making processes. Our approach includes
three main innovations: (1) A robust phenotype representation that merges
critical patches with global context, harmonized with genomic data to minimize
local bias. (2) An Exponential Prototype Update Strategy (EMA ProtoUp) that
sustains stable cross-modal associations and employs a wandering mechanism to
adapt prototypes flexibly to tumor heterogeneity. (3) A hierarchical prototype
matching scheme designed to capture global centrality, local typicality, and
cohort-level trends, thereby refining prototype inference. Comprehensive
evaluations on four publicly available cancer datasets indicate that our method
surpasses current leading unimodal and multimodal survival prediction
techniques in both accuracy and interoperability, providing a new perspective
on prototype learning for critical medical applications. Our source code is

Abstract: Deep learning in medical imaging is often limited by scarce and imbalanced
annotated data. We present SSGNet, a unified framework that combines class
specific generative modeling with iterative semisupervised pseudo labeling to
enhance both classification and segmentation. Rather than functioning as a
standalone model, SSGNet augments existing baselines by expanding training data
with StyleGAN3 generated images and refining labels through iterative pseudo
labeling. Experiments across multiple medical imaging benchmarks demonstrate
consistent gains in classification and segmentation performance, while Frechet
Inception Distance analysis confirms the high quality of generated samples.
These results highlight SSGNet as a practical strategy to mitigate annotation
bottlenecks and improve robustness in medical image analysis.

TL;DR: MeDiM是首个医学离散扩散模型，能够在不同模态间学习共享分布，无需特定模态组件，统一了图像-文本转换和联合生成图像-报告对等多种生成任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成医学模型受限于特定模态场景，阻碍了从影像、病理和临床笔记中整合互补证据，限制了其发展为能够跨生物医学数据全谱学习和推理的基础模型。

Method: 基于离散扩散框架，通过共享概率空间桥接视觉和语言表示；采用多模态大语言模型作为扩散主干；引入双向上下文的无因果注意力掩码和扩散感知的连续时间步嵌入。

Result: 实现了高保真医学生成（MIMIC-CXR上FID 16.60，PathGen上FID 24.19）和准确报告生成（METEOR 0.2650和0.2580）；联合生成的图像-报告对显著提升下游性能。

Conclusion: MeDiM支持连贯且临床基础的多模态输出，展示了跨模态医学生成的有效性。

Abstract: Recent advances in generative medical models are constrained by
modality-specific scenarios that hinder the integration of complementary
evidence from imaging, pathology, and clinical notes. This fragmentation limits
their evolution into foundation models that can learn and reason across the
full spectrum of biomedical data. We propose MeDiM, the first medical discrete
diffusion model that learns shared distributions across modalities without
modality-specific components. MeDiM unifies multiple generative tasks:
translating between images and text, and jointly producing image-report pairs
across domains in response to prompts. Built on a discrete diffusion framework,
MeDiM bridges vision and language representations through a shared
probabilistic space. To enable unified and flexible medical generation, we
employ a multimodal large language model (MLLM) as the diffusion backbone,
leveraging its prior knowledge and cross-modal reasoning. Two key designs are
introduced: (1) removing the causal attention mask for bidirectional context,
and (2) injecting continuous timestep embeddings for diffusion awareness.
Experiments demonstrate high-fidelity medical generation (FID 16.60 on
MIMIC-CXR and FID 24.19 on PathGen) and accurate report generation (METEOR
0.2650 and 0.2580). Jointly generated image-report pairs further enhance
downstream performance (plus6.43 percent BLEU-1, plus18.57 percent BLEU-2,
plus31.58 percent BLEU-3, plus4.80 percent METEOR), showing that MeDiM supports
coherent and clinically grounded multimodal outputs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统'定位-分割'流程中的信息瓶颈问题，避免语义简化为粗略几何提示，并改善时间一致性。

Method: 利用预训练T2V模型的优势，学习从视频整体表示到目标掩码的语言引导直接变形，采用单阶段生成方法。

Result: 在MeViS上达到51.1的J&F分数（比之前SOTA提高1.6），在零样本Ref-DAVIS17上达到73.3（提高2.7）。

Conclusion: 将视频理解任务建模为连续变形过程具有显著潜力，FlowRVS展示了这种方法的有效性。

Abstract: Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) requires segmenting specific
objects in a video guided by a natural language description. The core challenge
of RVOS is to anchor abstract linguistic concepts onto a specific set of pixels
and continuously segment them through the complex dynamics of a video. Faced
with this difficulty, prior work has often decomposed the task into a pragmatic
`locate-then-segment' pipeline. However, this cascaded design creates an
information bottleneck by simplifying semantics into coarse geometric prompts
(e.g, point), and struggles to maintain temporal consistency as the segmenting
process is often decoupled from the initial language grounding. To overcome
these fundamental limitations, we propose FlowRVS, a novel framework that
reconceptualizes RVOS as a conditional continuous flow problem. This allows us
to harness the inherent strengths of pretrained T2V models, fine-grained pixel
control, text-video semantic alignment, and temporal coherence. Instead of
conventional generating from noise to mask or directly predicting mask, we
reformulate the task by learning a direct, language-guided deformation from a
video's holistic representation to its target mask. Our one-stage, generative
approach achieves new state-of-the-art results across all major RVOS
benchmarks. Specifically, achieving a $\mathcal{J}\&\mathcal{F}$ of 51.1 in
MeViS (+1.6 over prior SOTA) and 73.3 in the zero shot Ref-DAVIS17 (+2.7),
demonstrating the significant potential of modeling video understanding tasks
as continuous deformation processes.

Abstract: We tackle the problem of forecasting bimanual 3D hand motion & articulation
from a single image in everyday settings. To address the lack of 3D hand

a diffusion model to lift 2D hand keypoint sequences to 4D hand motion. For the
forecasting model, we adopt a diffusion loss to account for the multimodality
in hand motion distribution. Extensive experiments across 6 datasets show the
benefits of training on diverse data with imputed labels (14% improvement) and
effectiveness of our lifting (42% better) & forecasting (16.4% gain) models,
over the best baselines, especially in zero-shot generalization to everyday

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频条件化的4D形状生成旨在从输入视频直接恢复随时间变化的3D几何和视角一致的外观。

Method: 基于大规模预训练3D模型，引入三个关键组件：时序注意力机制、时间感知点采样和4D潜在锚定、跨帧噪声共享。

Result: 方法能够准确捕捉非刚性运动、体积变化甚至拓扑转换，在多样化的野外视频中提高了鲁棒性和感知保真度。

Conclusion: 相比基线方法，该方法减少了失败模式，实现了更好的时间一致性和生成质量。

Abstract: Video-conditioned 4D shape generation aims to recover time-varying 3D
geometry and view-consistent appearance directly from an input video. In this
work, we introduce a native video-to-4D shape generation framework that
synthesizes a single dynamic 3D representation end-to-end from the video. Our
framework introduces three key components based on large-scale pre-trained 3D
models: (i) a temporal attention that conditions generation on all frames while
producing a time-indexed dynamic representation; (ii) a time-aware point
sampling and 4D latent anchoring that promote temporally consistent geometry
and texture; and (iii) noise sharing across frames to enhance temporal
stability. Our method accurately captures non-rigid motion, volume changes, and
even topological transitions without per-frame optimization. Across diverse
in-the-wild videos, our method improves robustness and perceptual fidelity and
reduces failure modes compared with the baselines.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative models have sparked exciting new possibilities
in the field of autonomous vehicles. Specifically, video generation models are
now being explored as controllable virtual testing environments.
Simultaneously, end-to-end (E2E) driving models have emerged as a streamlined
alternative to conventional modular autonomous driving systems, gaining
popularity for their simplicity and scalability. However, the application of
these techniques to simulation and planning raises important questions. First,
while video generation models can generate increasingly realistic videos, can
these videos faithfully adhere to the specified conditions and be realistic
enough for E2E autonomous planner evaluation? Second, given that data is
crucial for understanding and controlling E2E planners, how can we gain deeper
insights into their biases and improve their ability to generalize to
out-of-distribution scenarios? In this work, we bridge the gap between the
driving models and generative world models (Drive&Gen) to address these
questions. We propose novel statistical measures leveraging E2E drivers to
evaluate the realism of generated videos. By exploiting the controllability of
the video generation model, we conduct targeted experiments to investigate
distribution gaps affecting E2E planner performance. Finally, we show that
synthetic data produced by the video generation model offers a cost-effective
alternative to real-world data collection. This synthetic data effectively
improves E2E model generalization beyond existing Operational Design Domains,
facilitating the expansion of autonomous vehicle services into new operational
contexts.

Motivation: 现有文本到图像扩散模型难以整合精细的相机元数据（如光圈设置），无法实现精确的镜头模糊控制。

Method: 首先生成全焦图像，估计单目深度，使用焦点距离变换器预测焦点距离，然后通过可微分镜头模糊模型生成散焦图像，实现无监督学习。

Conclusion: 该方法通过整合相机元数据和物理成像过程，实现了精确可控的镜头模糊效果，为文本到图像生成提供了新的控制维度。

Abstract: Current text-to-image diffusion models excel at generating diverse,
high-quality images, yet they struggle to incorporate fine-grained camera
metadata such as precise aperture settings. In this work, we introduce a novel
text-to-image diffusion framework that leverages camera metadata, or EXIF data,
which is often embedded in image files, with an emphasis on generating
controllable lens blur. Our method mimics the physical image formation process
by first generating an all-in-focus image, estimating its monocular depth,
predicting a plausible focus distance with a novel focus distance transformer,
and then forming a defocused image with an existing differentiable lens blur
model. Gradients flow backwards through this whole process, allowing us to
learn without explicit supervision to generate defocus effects based on content
elements and the provided EXIF data. At inference time, this enables precise
interactive user control over defocus effects while preserving scene contents,
which is not achievable with existing diffusion models. Experimental results
demonstrate that our model enables superior fine-grained control without
altering the depicted scene.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有第一人称视觉基准主要关注白天场景，忽略了现实应用中不可避免的低光照条件，需要填补这一研究空白。

Method: 收集合成和真实世界的昼夜对齐视频，构建EgoNight-VQA数据集，采用日间增强的夜间自动标注引擎，并通过大量人工验证进行精炼。

Result: 评估最先进的多模态大语言模型发现，从白天转移到夜间时性能大幅下降，凸显了低光照条件下推理的挑战。

Conclusion: EgoNight为推进应用驱动的第一人称视觉研究提供了坚实基础，有助于开发跨光照域泛化的模型。

Abstract: Most existing benchmarks for egocentric vision understanding focus primarily
on daytime scenarios, overlooking the low-light conditions that are inevitable
in real-world applications. To investigate this gap, we present EgoNight, the
first comprehensive benchmark for nighttime egocentric vision, with visual
question answering (VQA) as the core task. A key feature of EgoNight is the
introduction of day-night aligned videos, which enhance night annotation
quality using the daytime data and reveal clear performance gaps between
lighting conditions. To achieve this, we collect both synthetic videos rendered
by Blender and real-world recordings, ensuring that scenes and actions are
visually and temporally aligned. Leveraging these paired videos, we construct
EgoNight-VQA, supported by a novel day-augmented night auto-labeling engine and
refinement through extensive human verification. Each QA pair is double-checked
by annotators for reliability. In total, EgoNight-VQA contains 3658 QA pairs
across 90 videos, spanning 12 diverse QA types, with more than 300 hours of
human work. Evaluations of state-of-the-art multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) reveal substantial performance drops when transferring from day to
night, underscoring the challenges of reasoning under low-light conditions.
Beyond VQA, EgoNight also introduces two auxiliary tasks, day-night
correspondence retrieval and egocentric depth estimation at night, that further
explore the boundaries of existing models. We believe EgoNight-VQA provides a
strong foundation for advancing application-driven egocentric vision research
and for developing models that generalize across illumination domains. All the
data and code will be made available upon acceptance.

TL;DR: Human3R是一个统一的、前馈式的框架，用于从单目视频中在线重建4D人体-场景，能同时恢复全局多人SMPL-X身体、密集3D场景和相机轨迹。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖多阶段流程、迭代的接触感知优化以及繁重的依赖项（如人体检测、深度估计和SLAM预处理），Human3R旨在通过单次前向传播实现统一重建，消除这些依赖和迭代过程。

Method: 基于4D在线重建模型CUT3R，使用参数高效的视觉提示调优，保留CUT3R的丰富时空先验，同时直接输出多个SMPL-X身体。

Result: 在小型合成数据集BEDLAM上仅训练一天（单GPU），就能以实时速度（15 FPS）和低内存占用（8 GB）一次性重建多人和3D场景，在多个任务上达到最先进或竞争性性能。

Conclusion: Human3R作为一个简单而强大的基线，有望轻松扩展到下游应用，为4D人体-场景重建提供了高效统一的解决方案。

Abstract: We present Human3R, a unified, feed-forward framework for online 4D
human-scene reconstruction, in the world frame, from casually captured
monocular videos. Unlike previous approaches that rely on multi-stage
pipelines, iterative contact-aware refinement between humans and scenes, and
heavy dependencies, e.g., human detection, depth estimation, and SLAM
pre-processing, Human3R jointly recovers global multi-person SMPL-X bodies
("everyone"), dense 3D scene ("everywhere"), and camera trajectories in a
single forward pass ("all-at-once"). Our method builds upon the 4D online
reconstruction model CUT3R, and uses parameter-efficient visual prompt tuning,
to strive to preserve CUT3R's rich spatiotemporal priors, while enabling direct
readout of multiple SMPL-X bodies. Human3R is a unified model that eliminates
heavy dependencies and iterative refinement. After being trained on the
relatively small-scale synthetic dataset BEDLAM for just one day on one GPU, it
achieves superior performance with remarkable efficiency: it reconstructs
multiple humans in a one-shot manner, along with 3D scenes, in one stage, at
real-time speed (15 FPS) with a low memory footprint (8 GB). Extensive
experiments demonstrate that Human3R delivers state-of-the-art or competitive
performance across tasks, including global human motion estimation, local human
mesh recovery, video depth estimation, and camera pose estimation, with a
single unified model. We hope that Human3R will serve as a simple yet strong
baseline, be easily extended for downstream applications.Code available in

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个评估文本到图像扩散模型历史表现的系统方法，发现这些模型在描绘历史时期时存在刻板印象、时代错误和人口统计不准确等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着文本到图像扩散模型在内容创作中的影响力增加，需要评估它们准确呈现历史背景的能力，这一方面在现有研究中尚未充分探索。

Method: 开发了HistVis数据集，包含30,000张由三种先进扩散模型生成的合成图像，通过精心设计的提示词描绘不同历史时期的普遍人类活动。评估包括三个方面：隐含风格关联、历史一致性和人口统计表示。

Result: 研究发现文本到图像模型在历史主题图像生成中存在系统性不准确，经常通过融入未声明的风格线索来刻板化过去时代，引入时代错误，并且未能反映合理的人口统计模式。

Conclusion: 这项工作为评估生成图像中历史表现提供了可扩展的方法和基准，是构建更准确和文化对齐的文本到图像模型的初步步骤。

Abstract: As Text-to-Image (TTI) diffusion models become increasingly influential in
content creation, growing attention is being directed toward their societal and
cultural implications. While prior research has primarily examined demographic
and cultural biases, the ability of these models to accurately represent
historical contexts remains largely underexplored. In this work, we present a
systematic and reproducible methodology for evaluating how TTI systems depict
different historical periods. For this purpose, we introduce the HistVis
dataset, a curated collection of 30,000 synthetic images generated by three
state-of-the-art diffusion models using carefully designed prompts depicting
universal human activities across different historical periods. We evaluate
generated imagery across three key aspects: (1) Implicit Stylistic
Associations: examining default visual styles associated with specific eras;
(2) Historical Consistency: identifying anachronisms such as modern artifacts
in pre-modern contexts; and (3) Demographic Representation: comparing generated
racial and gender distributions against historically plausible baselines. Our
findings reveal systematic inaccuracies in historically themed generated
imagery, as TTI models frequently stereotype past eras by incorporating
unstated stylistic cues, introduce anachronisms, and fail to reflect plausible
demographic patterns. By offering a scalable methodology and benchmark for
assessing historical representation in generated imagery, this work provides an
initial step toward building more historically accurate and culturally aligned
TTI models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单个视觉基础模型通常只在特定领域表现优异，限制了跨任务的通用性。现有方法需要完全重新训练来整合机器人领域知识，成本高昂且缺乏灵活性。

Method: 预训练阶段蒸馏多个VFMs构建视觉专家库，下游任务仅微调轻量级路由网络（<0.4%参数）动态选择专家，并引入补丁级专家路由和课程Top-K退火机制。

Result: 在17个多样化机器人任务中实现SOTA性能，减少任务无关区域的大范数异常值，专注于任务关键区域。

Conclusion: VER通过动态专家选择和参数高效微调，实现了跨任务的通用视觉表示学习，支持可扩展的专家利用和自适应机器人领域知识整合。

Abstract: Pretrained vision foundation models (VFMs) advance robotic learning via rich
visual representations, yet individual VFMs typically excel only in specific
domains, limiting generality across tasks. Distilling multiple VFMs into a
unified representation for policy can mitigate this limitation but often yields
inflexible task-specific feature selection and requires costly full re-training
to incorporate robot-domain knowledge. We propose VER, a Vision Expert
transformer for Robot learning. During pretraining, VER distills multiple VFMs
into a vision expert library. It then fine-tunes only a lightweight routing
network (fewer than 0.4% of parameters) to dynamically select task-relevant
experts from the pretrained library for downstream robot tasks. We further
introduce Patchwise Expert Routing with Curriculum Top-K Annealing to improve
both flexibility and precision of dynamic expert selection. Moreover, VER
supports parameter-efficient finetuning for scalable expert utilization and
adaptive robot-domain knowledge integration. Across 17 diverse robotic tasks
and multiple policy heads, VER achieves state-of-the-art performance. We find
that VER reduces large-norm outliers in task-irrelevant regions (e.g.,
background) and concentrates on task-critical regions. Visualizations and codes

Motivation: 传统分层规划中全局和局部规划器在动力学考虑上的不连续性导致在受限环境中轨迹跟踪失败。现有方法采用静态的动力学保真度递减方案，无法适应环境复杂度变化。

Method: 使用强化学习动态调整机器人动力学特性，将ADP集成到三种不同规划器中，并设计独立的ADP导航系统。

Result: 在仿真和真实世界测试中，ADP持续提高了导航成功率、安全性和效率。

Conclusion: ADP通过学习增强的范式有效解决了传统规划方法在动力学适应性方面的局限性，为机器人导航提供了更灵活和鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Autonomous robot navigation systems often rely on hierarchical planning,
where global planners compute collision-free paths without considering
dynamics, and local planners enforce dynamics constraints to produce executable
commands. This discontinuity in dynamics often leads to trajectory tracking
failure in highly constrained environments. Recent approaches integrate
dynamics within the entire planning process by gradually decreasing its
fidelity, e.g., increasing integration steps and reducing collision checking
resolution, for real-time planning efficiency. However, they assume that the
fidelity of the dynamics should decrease according to a manually designed
scheme. Such static settings fail to adapt to environmental complexity
variations, resulting in computational overhead in simple environments or
insufficient dynamics consideration in obstacle-rich scenarios. To overcome
this limitation, we propose Adaptive Dynamics Planning (ADP), a
learning-augmented paradigm that uses reinforcement learning to dynamically
adjust robot dynamics properties, enabling planners to adapt across diverse
environments. We integrate ADP into three different planners and further design
a standalone ADP-based navigation system, benchmarking them against other
baselines. Experiments in both simulation and real-world tests show that ADP
consistently improves navigation success, safety, and efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 触觉感知在提高机器人操作精度和多功能性方面具有巨大潜力，但由于传感器成本高、制造和集成困难以及从信号中提取可靠信息的挑战，其在机器人手中的应用仍然有限。

Method: 设计了一种紧凑的指尖结构，集成应变片传感器用于测量静态力，接触式麦克风传感器用于测量高频振动。所有传感器都内置在指尖内部，不易因直接交互而磨损。

Result: 传感器特性分析显示，应变片传感器在0-5N范围内提供可重复的2D平面力测量，接触式麦克风传感器能够区分接触材料属性。在三个灵巧操作任务中，触觉传感器单独或与视觉观察结合使用，显著提高了任务性能。

Conclusion: 多模态触觉传感器设计能够灵活应用于不同操作阶段，显著提升机器人操作性能，特别是在视觉受限的情况下，如精确计数和分离纸杯堆叠任务中达到100%成功率。

Abstract: Tactile sensing holds great promise for enhancing manipulation precision and
versatility, but its adoption in robotic hands remains limited due to high
sensor costs, manufacturing and integration challenges, and difficulties in
extracting expressive and reliable information from signals. In this work, we
present a low-cost, easy-to-make, adaptable, and compact fingertip design for
robotic hands that integrates multi-modal tactile sensors. We use strain gauge
sensors to capture static forces and a contact microphone sensor to measure
high-frequency vibrations during contact. These tactile sensors are integrated
into a compact design with a minimal sensor footprint, and all sensors are
internal to the fingertip and therefore not susceptible to direct wear and tear
from interactions. From sensor characterization, we show that strain gauge
sensors provide repeatable 2D planar force measurements in the 0-5 N range and
the contact microphone sensor has the capability to distinguish contact
material properties. We apply our design to three dexterous manipulation tasks
that range from zero to full visual occlusion. Given the expressiveness and
reliability of tactile sensor readings, we show that different tactile sensing
modalities can be used flexibly in different stages of manipulation, solely or
together with visual observations to achieve improved task performance. For
instance, we can precisely count and unstack a desired number of paper cups
from a stack with 100\% success rate which is hard to achieve with vision only.

hierarchical optimal controller. This allows the robot to generate reactive,
mobility-aware behaviour online and guides the user's impaired limb to exploit
residual functional mobility. The framework was tested in handover tasks
involving different upper-limb mobility impairments (i.e., emulated elbow and
shoulder arthritis, and wrist blockage), under both standing and seated
configurations with task constraints using a mobile manipulator, and
complemented by quantitative and qualitative comparisons with state-of-the-art
ergonomic HRI approaches. Preliminary results indicated that the framework can
personalise the interaction to fit within the user's impaired range of motion
and encourage joint usage based on the severity of their functional
limitations.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于分层场景图和LLM的主动语义感知方法，用于室内环境的探索任务，通过采样未观测区域的合理场景图来计算信息增益，实现更快速准确的环境语义理解。

Conclusion: 分层场景图结合LLM采样的方法能够有效支持主动语义感知，在复杂室内环境探索中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: We develop an approach for active semantic perception which refers to using
the semantics of the scene for tasks such as exploration. We build a compact,
hierarchical multi-layer scene graph that can represent large, complex indoor
environments at various levels of abstraction, e.g., nodes corresponding to
rooms, objects, walls, windows etc. as well as fine-grained details of their
geometry. We develop a procedure based on large language models (LLMs) to
sample plausible scene graphs of unobserved regions that are consistent with
partial observations of the scene. These samples are used to compute an
information gain of a potential waypoint for sophisticated spatial reasoning,
e.g., the two doors in the living room can lead to either a kitchen or a
bedroom. We evaluate this approach in complex, realistic 3D indoor environments
in simulation. We show using qualitative and quantitative experiments that our
approach can pin down the semantics of the environment quicker and more
accurately than baseline approaches.

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效处理模拟和真实系统中时空变化的环境变化，无需直接环境知识。

Abstract: Mobile robots, such as ground vehicles and quadrotors, are becoming
increasingly important in various fields, from logistics to agriculture, where
they automate processes in environments that are difficult to access for
humans. However, to perform effectively in uncertain environments using
model-based controllers, these systems require dynamics models capable of
responding to environmental variations, especially when direct access to
environmental information is limited. To enable such adaptivity and facilitate
integration with model predictive control, we propose an adaptive dynamics
model which bypasses the need for direct environmental knowledge by inferring
operational environments from state-action history. The dynamics model is based
on neural ordinary equations, and a two-phase training procedure is used to
learn latent environment representations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
our approach through goal-reaching and path-tracking tasks on three robotic
platforms of increasing complexity: a 2D differential wheeled robot with
changing wheel contact conditions, a 3D quadrotor in variational wind fields,
and the Sphero BOLT robot under two contact conditions for real-world
deployment. Empirical results corroborate that our method can handle temporally
and spatially varying environmental changes in both simulation and real-world
systems.

Conclusion: 提出的去中心化双视角融合方法能够有效估计目标物体的姿态和速度，在机器人操作器中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Accurate pose and velocity estimation is essential for effective spatial task
planning in robotic manipulators. While centralized sensor fusion has
traditionally been used to improve pose estimation accuracy, this paper
presents a novel decentralized fusion approach to estimate both pose and
velocity. We use dual-view measurements from an eye-in-hand and an eye-to-hand
vision sensor configuration mounted on a manipulator to track a target object
whose motion is modeled as random walk (stochastic acceleration model). The
robot runs two independent adaptive extended Kalman filters formulated on a
matrix Lie group, developed as part of this work. These filters predict poses
and velocities on the manifold $\mathbb{SE}(3) \times \mathbb{R}^3 \times
\mathbb{R}^3$ and update the state on the manifold $\mathbb{SE}(3)$. The final
fused state comprising the fused pose and velocities of the target is obtained
using a correlation-aware fusion rule on Lie groups. The proposed method is
evaluated on a UFactory xArm 850 equipped with Intel RealSense cameras,
tracking a moving target. Experimental results validate the effectiveness and
robustness of the proposed decentralized dual-view estimation framework,
showing consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: We present ARRC (Advanced Reasoning Robot Control), a practical system that
connects natural-language instructions to safe local robotic control by
combining Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with RGB-D perception and
guarded execution on an affordable robot arm. The system indexes curated robot
knowledge (movement patterns, task templates, and safety heuristics) in a
vector database, retrieves task-relevant context for each instruction, and
conditions a large language model (LLM) to produce JSON-structured action
plans. Plans are executed on a UFactory xArm 850 fitted with a Dynamixel-driven
parallel gripper and an Intel RealSense D435 camera. Perception uses AprilTag
detections fused with depth to produce object-centric metric poses. Execution
is enforced via software safety gates: workspace bounds, speed and force caps,
timeouts, and bounded retries. We describe the architecture, knowledge design,
integration choices, and a reproducible evaluation protocol for tabletop scan,
approach, and pick-place tasks. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy
of the proposed approach. Our design shows that RAG-based planning can
substantially improve plan validity and adaptability while keeping perception
and low-level control local to the robot.

Motivation: 传统人工势场方法在蜂群控制中容易陷入局部最小值和死锁，特别是在有障碍物的环境中。现有解决方案通常是被动的，导致集体导航缓慢低效，因此许多APF方法只能在无障碍环境或简化模拟中验证。

Method: GO-Flock包含上游感知模块（处理深度图提取路径点和虚拟代理用于避障）和下游集体导航模块（应用新颖的APF策略实现有效蜂群行为）。

Result: 在障碍物密集环境中验证了GO-Flock，并与被动APF方法进行了对比，展示了其在蜂群行为和克服局部最小值方面的优势。通过硬件在环实验成功在森林环境中控制了9架无人机（6架物理+3架虚拟）的蜂群。

Conclusion: GO-Flock通过将规划与反应式控制相结合，有效解决了传统APF方法在复杂环境中的局限性，实现了在障碍物密集环境中的高效蜂群导航。

Abstract: Artificial Potential Field (APF) methods are widely used for reactive
flocking control, but they often suffer from challenges such as deadlocks and
local minima, especially in the presence of obstacles. Existing solutions to
address these issues are typically passive, leading to slow and inefficient
collective navigation. As a result, many APF approaches have only been
validated in obstacle-free environments or simplified, pseudo 3D simulations.
This paper presents GO-Flock, a hybrid flocking framework that integrates
planning with reactive APF-based control. GO-Flock consists of an upstream
Perception Module, which processes depth maps to extract waypoints and virtual
agents for obstacle avoidance, and a downstream Collective Navigation Module,
which applies a novel APF strategy to achieve effective flocking behavior in
cluttered environments. We evaluate GO-Flock against passive APF-based
approaches to demonstrate their respective merits, such as their flocking
behavior and the ability to overcome local minima. Finally, we validate
GO-Flock through obstacle-filled environment and also hardware-in-the-loop
experiments where we successfully flocked a team of nine drones, six physical
and three virtual, in a forest environment.

Conclusion: DeLTa框架成功解决了透明物体长时程精确操作的挑战，展示了在单次演示下对新物体的良好泛化能力。

Abstract: Despite the prevalence of transparent object interactions in human everyday
life, transparent robotic manipulation research remains limited to
short-horizon tasks and basic grasping capabilities.Although some methods have
partially addressed these issues, most of them have limitations in
generalizability to novel objects and are insufficient for precise long-horizon
robot manipulation. To address this limitation, we propose DeLTa (Demonstration
and Language-Guided Novel Transparent Object Manipulation), a novel framework
that integrates depth estimation, 6D pose estimation, and vision-language
planning for precise long-horizon manipulation of transparent objects guided by
natural task instructions. A key advantage of our method is its
single-demonstration approach, which generalizes 6D trajectories to novel
transparent objects without requiring category-level priors or additional
training. Additionally, we present a task planner that refines the
VLM-generated plan to account for the constraints of a single-arm, eye-in-hand
robot for long-horizon object manipulation tasks. Through comprehensive
evaluation, we demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing
transparent object manipulation approaches, particularly in long-horizon
scenarios requiring precise manipulation capabilities. Project page:

Conclusion: MG-Select框架有效提升了VLA模型的精度和泛化能力，无需额外训练即可实现显著性能改进

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) have demonstrated remarkable performance
in robot control. However, they remain fundamentally limited in tasks that
require high precision due to their single-inference paradigm. While test-time
scaling approaches using external verifiers have shown promise, they require
additional training and fail to generalize to unseen conditions. We propose
Masking Distribution Guided Selection (MG-Select), a novel test-time scaling
framework for VLAs that leverages the model's internal properties without
requiring additional training or external modules. Our approach utilizes KL
divergence from a reference action token distribution as a confidence metric
for selecting the optimal action from multiple candidates. We introduce a
reference distribution generated by the same VLA but with randomly masked
states and language conditions as inputs, ensuring maximum uncertainty while
remaining aligned with the target task distribution. Additionally, we propose a
joint training strategy that enables the model to learn both conditional and
unconditional distributions by applying dropout to state and language
conditions, thereby further improving the quality of the reference
distribution. Our experiments demonstrate that MG-Select achieves significant
performance improvements, including a 28%/35% improvement in real-world
in-distribution/out-of-distribution tasks, along with a 168% relative gain on
RoboCasa pick-and-place tasks trained with 30 demonstrations.

Motivation: 传统方法直接将高维视觉观察映射到动作命令，存在样本效率低和仿真到现实差距大的长期挑战。

Method: 两阶段学习：上游使用掩码Transformer进行时序建模和对比学习提取表示；下游使用具有全局状态信息的教师策略进行监督指导，并逐步减少指导。

Result: 在模拟和真实环境中的广泛实验表明，OMC-RL实现了优越的样本效率和渐近策略性能，同时提高了在多样化和感知复杂场景中的泛化能力。

Conclusion: OMC-RL框架有效解决了视觉运动策略学习中的关键挑战，为实际应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: A prevailing approach for learning visuomotor policies is to employ
reinforcement learning to map high-dimensional visual observations directly to
action commands. However, the combination of high-dimensional visual inputs and
agile maneuver outputs leads to long-standing challenges, including low sample
efficiency and significant sim-to-real gaps. To address these issues, we
propose Oracle-Guided Masked Contrastive Reinforcement Learning (OMC-RL), a
novel framework designed to improve the sample efficiency and asymptotic
performance of visuomotor policy learning. OMC-RL explicitly decouples the
learning process into two stages: an upstream representation learning stage and
a downstream policy learning stage. In the upstream stage, a masked Transformer
module is trained with temporal modeling and contrastive learning to extract
temporally-aware and task-relevant representations from sequential visual
inputs. After training, the learned encoder is frozen and used to extract
visual representations from consecutive frames, while the Transformer module is
discarded. In the downstream stage, an oracle teacher policy with privileged
access to global state information supervises the agent during early training
to provide informative guidance and accelerate early policy learning. This
guidance is gradually reduced to allow independent exploration as training
progresses. Extensive experiments in simulated and real-world environments
demonstrate that OMC-RL achieves superior sample efficiency and asymptotic
policy performance, while also improving generalization across diverse and
perceptually complex scenarios.

Abstract: Learning stable dynamical systems from data is crucial for safe and reliable
robot motion planning and control. However, extending stability guarantees to
trajectories defined on Riemannian manifolds poses significant challenges due
to the manifold's geometric constraints. To address this, we propose a general
framework for learning stable dynamical systems on Riemannian manifolds using
neural ordinary differential equations. Our method guarantees stability by
projecting the neural vector field evolving on the manifold so that it strictly
satisfies the Lyapunov stability criterion, ensuring stability at every system
state. By leveraging a flexible neural parameterisation for both the base
vector field and the Lyapunov function, our framework can accurately represent
complex trajectories while respecting manifold constraints by evolving
solutions directly on the manifold. We provide an efficient training strategy
for applying our framework and demonstrate its utility by solving Riemannian
LASA datasets on the unit quaternion (S^3) and symmetric positive-definite
matrix manifolds, as well as robotic motions evolving on \mathbb{R}^3 \times
S^3. We demonstrate the performance, scalability, and practical applicability
of our approach through extensive simulations and by learning robot motions in
a real-world experiment.

Abstract: This research introduces two efficient methods to estimate the collision risk
of planned trajectories in autonomous driving under uncertain driving
conditions. Deterministic collision checks of planned trajectories are often
inaccurate or overly conservative, as noisy perception, localization errors,
and uncertain predictions of other traffic participants introduce significant
uncertainty into the planning process. This paper presents two semi-analytic
methods to compute the collision probability of planned trajectories with
arbitrary convex obstacles. The first approach evaluates the probability of
spatial overlap between an autonomous vehicle and surrounding obstacles, while
the second estimates the collision probability based on stochastic boundary
crossings. Both formulations incorporate full state uncertainties, including
position, orientation, and velocity, and achieve high accuracy at computational
costs suitable for real-time planning. Simulation studies verify that the
proposed methods closely match Monte Carlo results while providing significant
runtime advantages, enabling their use in risk-aware trajectory planning. The
collision estimation methods are available as open-source software:

Abstract: Wearable robots offer a promising solution for quantitatively monitoring gait
and providing systematic, adaptive assistance to promote patient independence
and improve gait. However, due to significant interpersonal and intrapersonal
variability in walking patterns, it is important to design robot controllers
that can adapt to the unique characteristics of each individual. This paper
investigates the potential of human-in-the-loop optimisation (HILO) to deliver
personalised assistance in gait training. The Covariance Matrix Adaptation
Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) was employed to continuously optimise an
assist-as-needed controller of a lower-limb exoskeleton. Six healthy
individuals participated over a two-day experiment. Our results suggest that
while the CMA-ES appears to converge to a unique set of stiffnesses for each
individual, no measurable impact on the subjects' performance was observed
during the validation trials. These findings highlight the impact of
human-robot co-adaptation and human behaviour variability, whose effect may be
greater than potential benefits of personalising rule-based assistive
controllers. Our work contributes to understanding the limitations of current
personalisation approaches in exoskeleton-assisted gait rehabilitation and
identifies key challenges for effective implementation of human-in-the-loop
optimisation in this domain.

Abstract: Robotic grasping is one of the most fundamental tasks in robotic
manipulation, and grasp detection/generation has long been the subject of
extensive research. Recently, language-driven grasp generation has emerged as a
promising direction due to its practical interaction capabilities. However,
most existing approaches either lack sufficient reasoning and generalization
capabilities or depend on complex modular pipelines. Moreover, current grasp
foundation models tend to overemphasize dialog and object semantics, resulting
in inferior performance and restriction to single-object grasping. To maintain
strong reasoning ability and generalization in cluttered environments, we
propose VCoT-Grasp, an end-to-end grasp foundation model that incorporates
visual chain-of-thought reasoning to enhance visual understanding for grasp
generation. VCoT-Grasp adopts a multi-turn processing paradigm that dynamically
focuses on visual inputs while providing interpretable reasoning traces. For
training, we refine and introduce a large-scale dataset, VCoT-GraspSet,
comprising 167K synthetic images with over 1.36M grasps, as well as 400+
real-world images with more than 1.2K grasps, annotated with intermediate
bounding boxes. Extensive experiments on both VCoT-GraspSet and real robot
demonstrate that our method significantly improves grasp success rates and
generalizes effectively to unseen objects, backgrounds, and distractors. More

Conclusion: 该框架能有效平衡跳跃高度和能耗的权衡关系，显著减少手动设计迭代，生成可直接制造的设计

Abstract: A monoped's jump height and energy consumption depend on both, its mechanical
design and control strategy. Existing co-design frameworks typically optimize
for either maximum height or minimum energy, neglecting their trade-off. They
also often omit gearbox parameter optimization and use oversimplified actuator
mass models, producing designs difficult to replicate in practice. In this
work, we introduce a novel three-stage co-design optimization framework that
jointly maximizes jump height while minimizing mechanical energy consumption of
a monoped. The proposed method explicitly incorporates realistic actuator mass
models and optimizes mechanical design (including gearbox) and control
parameters within a unified framework. The resulting design outputs are then
used to automatically generate a parameterized CAD model suitable for direct
fabrication, significantly reducing manual design iterations. Our experimental
evaluations demonstrate a 50 percent reduction in mechanical energy consumption
compared to the baseline design, while achieving a jump height of 0.8m. Video

Result: 学习到的潜在动力学支持短时程运动预测，行动者-评论者算法发现了有效的运动策略

Conclusion: 潜在动力学MB-RL方法有潜力仅基于噪声传感器反馈实现软体机器人的自适应运动

Abstract: Soft robotic crawlers are mobile robots that utilize soft body deformability
and compliance to achieve locomotion through surface contact. Designing control
strategies for such systems is challenging due to model inaccuracies, sensor
noise, and the need to discover locomotor gaits. In this work, we present a
model-based reinforcement learning (MB-RL) framework in which latent dynamics
inferred from onboard sensors serve as a predictive model that guides an
actor-critic algorithm to optimize locomotor policies. We evaluate the
framework on a minimal crawler model in simulation using inertial measurement
units and time-of-flight sensors as observations. The learned latent dynamics
enable short-horizon motion prediction while the actor-critic discovers
effective locomotor policies. This approach highlights the potential of
latent-dynamics MB-RL for enabling embodied soft robotic adaptive locomotion
based solely on noisy sensor feedback.

Abstract: Planetary exploration missions require robust locomotion systems capable of
operating in extreme environments over extended periods. This paper presents
the DISTANT (Distant Transmission and Steering Systems) design, a novel
approach for relocating rover traction and steering actuators from
wheel-mounted positions to a thermally protected warm box within the rover
body. The design addresses critical challenges in long-distance traversal
missions by protecting sensitive components from thermal cycling, dust
contamination, and mechanical wear. A double wishbone suspension configuration
with cardan joints and capstan drive steering has been selected as the optimal
architecture following comprehensive trade-off analysis. The system enables
independent wheel traction, steering control, and suspension management whilst
maintaining all motorisation within the protected environment. The design meets
a 50 km traverse requirement without performance degradation, with integrated
dust protection mechanisms and thermal management solutions. Testing and
validation activities are planned for Q1 2026 following breadboard
manufacturing at 1:3 scale.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种两阶段方法，通过校准和融合UWB数据与SLAM数据，实现跨会话的坐标系一致且精确的定位。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SLAM方法每次运行时坐标系原点会重置，而UWB定位需要准确分配锚点坐标。需要一种方法在相同环境中实现坐标系一致且精确的定位。

Method: 第一阶段：使用一次完整运行的测距和里程计数据，通过连续时间批量优化恢复锚点的3D位置。第二阶段：使用滑动窗口优化方案融合UWB和SLAM数据。

Result: 在NTU VIRAL数据集上的六个无人机飞行场景中进行了实验，证明使用一次运行的数据进行校准就足以在其余运行中实现精确定位。

Conclusion: 该方法能够实现跨会话的坐标系一致定位，且校准过程简单高效。

Abstract: Onboard simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) methods are commonly
used to provide accurate localization information for autonomous robots.
However, the coordinate origin of SLAM estimate often resets for each run. On
the other hand, UWB-based localization with fixed anchors can ensure a
consistent coordinate reference across sessions; however, it requires an
accurate assignment of the anchor nodes' coordinates. To this end, we propose a
two-stage approach that calibrates and fuses UWB data and SLAM data to achieve
coordinate-wise consistent and accurate localization in the same environment.
In the first stage, we solve a continuous-time batch optimization problem by
using the range and odometry data from one full run, incorporating height
priors and anchor-to-anchor distance factors to recover the anchors' 3D
positions. For the subsequent runs in the second stage, a sliding-window
optimization scheme fuses the UWB and SLAM data, which facilitates accurate
localization in the same coordinate system. Experiments are carried out on the
NTU VIRAL dataset with six scenarios of UAV flight, and we show that
calibration using data in one run is sufficient to enable accurate localization
in the remaining runs. We release our source code to benefit the community at
https://github.com/ntdathp/slam-uwb-calibration.

Abstract: Dexterous grasping with multi-fingered hands remains challenging due to
high-dimensional articulations and the cost of optimization-based pipelines.
Existing end-to-end methods require training on large-scale datasets for
specific hands, limiting their ability to generalize across different
embodiments. We propose an eigengrasp-based, end-to-end framework for
cross-embodiment grasp generation. From a hand's morphology description, we
derive a morphology embedding and an eigengrasp set. Conditioned on these,
together with the object point cloud and wrist pose, an amplitude predictor
regresses articulation coefficients in a low-dimensional space, which are
decoded into full joint articulations. Articulation learning is supervised with
a Kinematic-Aware Articulation Loss (KAL) that emphasizes fingertip-relevant
motions and injects morphology-specific structure. In simulation on unseen
objects across three dexterous hands, our model attains a 91.9% average grasp
success rate with less than 0.4 seconds inference per grasp. With few-shot
adaptation to an unseen hand, it achieves 85.6% success on unseen objects in
simulation, and real-world experiments on this few-shot generalized hand
achieve an 87% success rate. The code and additional materials will be made
available upon publication on our project website

Abstract: This project proposes a bioinspired multi-robot system using Distributed
Optimization for efficient exploration and mapping of unknown environments.
Each robot explores its environment and creates a map, which is afterwards put
together to form a global 2D map of the environment. Inspired by wall-following
behaviors, each robot autonomously explores its neighborhood based on a tactile
sensor, similar to the antenna of a cockroach, mounted on the surface of the
robot. Instead of avoiding obstacles, robots log collision points when they
touch obstacles. This decentralized control strategy ensures effective task
allocation and efficient exploration of unknown terrains, with applications in
search and rescue, industrial inspection, and environmental monitoring. The
approach was validated through experiments using e-puck robots in a simulated
1.5 x 1.5 m environment with three obstacles. The results demonstrated the
system's effectiveness in achieving high coverage, minimizing collisions, and
constructing accurate 2D maps.

Abstract: Chronic wounds, such as diabetic, pressure, and venous ulcers, affect over
6.5 million patients in the United States alone and generate an annual cost
exceeding \$25 billion. Despite this burden, chronic wound care remains a
routine yet manual process performed exclusively by trained clinicians due to
its critical safety demands. We envision a future in which robotics and
automation support wound care to lower costs and enhance patient outcomes. This
paper introduces an autonomous framework for one of the most fundamental yet
challenging subtasks in wound redressing: adhesive tape manipulation.
Specifically, we address two critical capabilities: tape initial detachment
(TID) and secure tape placement. To handle the complex adhesive dynamics of
detachment, we propose a force-feedback imitation learning approach trained
from human teleoperation demonstrations. For tape placement, we develop a
numerical trajectory optimization method based to ensure smooth adhesion and
wrinkle-free application across diverse anatomical surfaces. We validate these
methods through extensive experiments, demonstrating reliable performance in
both quantitative evaluations and integrated wound redressing pipelines. Our
results establish tape manipulation as an essential step toward practical
robotic wound care automation.

Abstract: Robotic pollination offers a promising alternative to manual labor and
bumblebee-assisted methods in controlled agriculture, where wind-driven
pollination is absent and regulatory restrictions limit the use of commercial
pollinators. In this work, we present and validate a vision-guided robotic
framework that uses data from an end-effector mounted RGB-D sensor and combines
3D plant reconstruction, targeted grasp planning, and physics-based vibration
modeling to enable precise pollination. First, the plant is reconstructed in 3D
and registered to the robot coordinate frame to identify obstacle-free grasp
poses along the main stem. Second, a discrete elastic rod model predicts the
relationship between actuation parameters and flower dynamics, guiding the
selection of optimal pollination strategies. Finally, a manipulator with soft
grippers grasps the stem and applies controlled vibrations to induce pollen
release. End-to-end experiments demonstrate a 92.5\% main-stem grasping success
rate, and simulation-guided optimization of vibration parameters further
validates the feasibility of our approach, ensuring that the robot can safely
and effectively perform pollination without damaging the flower. To our
knowledge, this is the first robotic system to jointly integrate vision-based
grasping and vibration modeling for automated precision pollination.

Abstract: Hair care is an essential daily activity, yet it remains inaccessible to
individuals with limited mobility and challenging for autonomous robot systems
due to the fine-grained physical structure and complex dynamics of hair. In
this work, we present DYMO-Hair, a model-based robot hair care system. We
introduce a novel dynamics learning paradigm that is suited for volumetric
quantities such as hair, relying on an action-conditioned latent state editing
mechanism, coupled with a compact 3D latent space of diverse hairstyles to
improve generalizability. This latent space is pre-trained at scale using a
novel hair physics simulator, enabling generalization across previously unseen
hairstyles. Using the dynamics model with a Model Predictive Path Integral
(MPPI) planner, DYMO-Hair is able to perform visual goal-conditioned hair
styling. Experiments in simulation demonstrate that DYMO-Hair's dynamics model
outperforms baselines on capturing local deformation for diverse, unseen
hairstyles. DYMO-Hair further outperforms baselines in closed-loop hair styling
tasks on unseen hairstyles, with an average of 22% lower final geometric error
and 42% higher success rate than the state-of-the-art system. Real-world
experiments exhibit zero-shot transferability of our system to wigs, achieving
consistent success on challenging unseen hairstyles where the state-of-the-art
system fails. Together, these results introduce a foundation for model-based
robot hair care, advancing toward more generalizable, flexible, and accessible
robot hair styling in unconstrained physical environments. More details are

Abstract: Recent advances in control robot methods, from end-to-end
vision-language-action frameworks to modular systems with predefined

to directly generate executable robot trajectories. By grounding high-level
instructions in code, EmbodiedCoder enables flexible object geometry
parameterization and manipulation trajectory synthesis without additional data
collection or fine-tuning.This coding-based paradigm provides a transparent and
generalizable way to connect perception with manipulation. Experiments on real
mobile robots show that EmbodiedCoder achieves robust performance across
diverse long-term tasks and generalizes effectively to novel objects and

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合二型模糊集、粒计算和聚类的新框架，用于提升大数据环境中的可解释性和公平性，在空气质量数据集上表现出优于传统方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器学习模型在环境监测等领域的复杂性增加，需要提高模型的可解释性和公平性以满足信任、伦理和法规要求。传统黑盒模型缺乏透明度，而现有的XAI技术如LIME和SHAP经常牺牲准确性或无法提供内在洞察。

Result: 二型模糊聚类相比一型方法提升约4%的凝聚力（轮廓系数0.365 vs 0.349），改善公平性（熵0.918），规则组件实现平均覆盖率0.65，运行时呈线性（约0.005秒）。

Conclusion: 该方法在可解释性、公平性和效率方面优于DBSCAN和凝聚聚类等基线方法，二型模糊聚类在轮廓分数上提升4%，在公平性上熵减少达1%。

Abstract: The growing complexity of machine learning (ML) models in big data analytics,
especially in domains such as environmental monitoring, highlights the critical
need for interpretability and explainability to promote trust, ethical
considerations, and regulatory adherence (e.g., GDPR). Traditional "black-box"
models obstruct transparency, whereas post-hoc explainable AI (XAI) techniques
like LIME and SHAP frequently compromise accuracy or fail to deliver inherent
insights. This paper presents a novel framework that combines type-2 fuzzy
sets, granular computing, and clustering to boost explainability and fairness
in big data environments. When applied to the UCI Air Quality dataset, the
framework effectively manages uncertainty in noisy sensor data, produces
linguistic rules, and assesses fairness using silhouette scores and entropy.
Key contributions encompass: (1) A type-2 fuzzy clustering approach that
enhances cohesion by about 4% compared to type-1 methods (silhouette 0.365 vs.
0.349) and improves fairness (entropy 0.918); (2) Incorporation of fairness
measures to mitigate biases in unsupervised scenarios; (3) A rule-based
component for intrinsic XAI, achieving an average coverage of 0.65; (4)
Scalable assessments showing linear runtime (roughly 0.005 seconds for sampled
big data sizes). Experimental outcomes reveal superior performance relative to
baselines such as DBSCAN and Agglomerative Clustering in terms of
interpretability, fairness, and efficiency. Notably, the proposed method
achieves a 4% improvement in silhouette score over type-1 fuzzy clustering and
outperforms baselines in fairness (entropy reduction by up to 1%) and
efficiency.

Conclusion: Transformer模型在金融预测中存在对数据波动性不敏感和频率偏见的风险，需要进一步优化以提高决策质量。

Abstract: Transformer models have become increasingly popular in financial
applications, yet their potential risk making and biases remain under-explored.
The purpose of this work is to audit the reliance of the model on volatile data
for decision-making, and quantify how the frequency of price movements affects
the model's prediction confidence. We employ a transformer model for
prediction, and introduce a metric based on Partial Information Decomposition
(PID) to measure the influence of each asset on the model's decision making.
Our analysis reveals two key observations: first, the model disregards data
volatility entirely, and second, it is biased toward data with lower-frequency
price movements.

Abstract: This paper presents a controlled study of adversarial reinforcement learning
in network security through a custom OpenAI Gym environment that models
brute-force attacks and reactive defenses on multi-port services. The
environment captures realistic security trade-offs including background traffic
noise, progressive exploitation mechanics, IP-based evasion tactics, honeypot
traps, and multi-level rate-limiting defenses. Competing attacker and defender
agents are trained using Deep Q-Networks (DQN) within a zero-sum reward
framework, where successful exploits yield large terminal rewards while
incremental actions incur small costs. Through systematic evaluation across
multiple configurations (varying trap detection probabilities, exploitation
difficulty thresholds, and training regimens), the results demonstrate that
defender observability and trap effectiveness create substantial barriers to
successful attacks. The experiments reveal that reward shaping and careful
training scheduling are critical for learning stability in this adversarial
setting. The defender consistently maintains strategic advantage across 50,000+
training episodes, with performance gains amplifying when exposed to complex
defensive strategies including adaptive IP blocking and port-specific controls.
Complete implementation details, reproducible hyperparameter configurations,
and architectural guidelines are provided to support future research in
adversarial RL for cybersecurity. The zero-sum formulation and realistic
operational constraints make this environment suitable for studying autonomous
defense systems, attacker-defender co-evolution, and transfer learning to

*Muhammad Arif Hakimi Zamrai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种从单点优化转向生成式逆向设计的范式转变，使用条件变分自编码器(CVAE)框架生成多样化的高性能设计组合，在翼型自噪声最小化问题上显著优于传统代理优化方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统代理优化方法(SBO)只能收敛到单点解，限制了设计空间探索并忽略了有价值的替代拓扑结构，需要一种能够生成多样化高性能设计组合的新方法。

Method: 基于条件变分自编码器(CVAE)的框架，学习系统设计参数与性能之间的概率映射，能够根据特定性能目标生成多样化的高性能候选设计组合。

Result: CVAE框架成功生成了256个新颖设计，有效率为94.1%。其中77.2%的有效设计在性能上优于SBO基线找到的单点最优设计。

Conclusion: 生成式方法不仅能发现更高质量的解决方案，还提供了丰富的多样化候选设计组合，通过支持多标准决策从根本上改进了工程设计过程。

Abstract: Inverse design, which seeks to find optimal parameters for a target output,
is a central challenge in engineering. Surrogate-based optimization (SBO) has
become a standard approach, yet it is fundamentally structured to converge to a
single-point solution, thereby limiting design space exploration and ignoring
potentially valuable alternative topologies. This paper presents a paradigm
shift from single-point optimization to generative inverse design. We introduce
a framework based on a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) that learns a
probabilistic mapping between a system's design parameters and its performance,
enabling the generation of a diverse portfolio of high-performing candidates
conditioned on a specific performance objective. We apply this methodology to
the complex, non-linear problem of minimizing airfoil self-noise, using a
high-performing SBO method from a prior benchmark study as a rigorous baseline.
The CVAE framework successfully generated 256 novel designs with a 94.1\%
validity rate. A subsequent surrogate-based evaluation revealed that 77.2\% of
these valid designs achieved superior performance compared to the single
optimal design found by the SBO baseline. This work demonstrates that the
generative approach not only discovers higher-quality solutions but also
provides a rich portfolio of diverse candidates, fundamentally enhancing the
engineering design process by enabling multi-criteria decision-making.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 系统文献综述分析了机器学习在数字银行欺诈检测中的应用，总结了118项研究，发现监督学习仍是主流，无监督异常检测用于处理新型欺诈，深度学习能检测复杂欺诈模式，混合模型表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着数字银行欺诈日益复杂，需要系统评估机器学习方法在欺诈检测中的有效性，为实践提供指导。

Method: 遵循PRISMA指南，采用结构化识别、筛选、资格评估和纳入流程，分析118项同行评审研究和机构报告。

Result: 监督学习方法（决策树、逻辑回归、支持向量机）因其可解释性和稳定性能仍是主导；无监督异常检测能处理高度不平衡数据集中的新型欺诈；深度学习（特别是循环和卷积神经网络）能建模序列交易数据检测复杂欺诈；混合模型展现最佳适应性。

Conclusion: 机器学习在数字银行欺诈检测中发挥重要作用，混合模型结合监督、无监督和深度学习策略是最有前景的解决方案，但可解释性和实时部署仍是挑战。

Abstract: This systematic literature review examines the role of machine learning in
fraud detection within digital banking, synthesizing evidence from 118
peer-reviewed studies and institutional reports. Following the PRISMA
guidelines, the review applied a structured identification, screening,
eligibility, and inclusion process to ensure methodological rigor and
transparency. The findings reveal that supervised learning methods, such as
decision trees, logistic regression, and support vector machines, remain the
dominant paradigm due to their interpretability and established performance,
while unsupervised anomaly detection approaches are increasingly adopted to
address novel fraud patterns in highly imbalanced datasets. Deep learning
architectures, particularly recurrent and convolutional neural networks, have
emerged as transformative tools capable of modeling sequential transaction data
and detecting complex fraud typologies, though challenges of interpretability
and real-time deployment persist. Hybrid models that combine supervised,
unsupervised, and deep learning strategies demonstrate superior adaptability
and detection accuracy, highlighting their potential as convergent solutions.

*Eric Jahns,Davi Moreno,Milan Stojkov,Michel A. Kinsy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了首个针对高性能深度脉冲神经网络的QIF神经元模型离散化方法，通过分析其动态特性并提供稳定的训练策略，在多个数据集上超越了基于LIF的现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LIF神经元虽然计算效率高但表达能力有限，而QIF等复杂模型具有更丰富的非线性动态特性但训练不稳定，因此需要开发既能保持丰富动态又能稳定训练的QIF离散化方法。

Method: 提出了QIF神经元模型的首次离散化，推导了从离散化参数集直接得到的代理梯度窗口分析公式，以最小化梯度不匹配问题。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100、ImageNet和CIFAR-10 DVS数据集上评估，证明该方法能够超越基于LIF的最先进方法。

Conclusion: QIF神经元离散化方法为深度SNNs提供了一个有吸引力的LIF替代方案，结合了更丰富的动态特性和实际可扩展性。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have emerged as energy-efficient alternatives
to traditional artificial neural networks, leveraging asynchronous and
biologically inspired neuron dynamics. Among existing neuron models, the Leaky
Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neuron has become widely adopted in deep SNNs due to
its simplicity and computational efficiency. However, this efficiency comes at
the expense of expressiveness, as LIF dynamics are constrained to linear decay
at each timestep. In contrast, more complex models, such as the Quadratic
Integrate-and-Fire (QIF) neuron, exhibit richer, nonlinear dynamics but have
seen limited adoption due to their training instability. On that note, we
propose the first discretization of the QIF neuron model tailored for
high-performance deep spiking neural networks and provide an in-depth analysis
of its dynamics. To ensure training stability, we derive an analytical
formulation for surrogate gradient windows directly from our discretizations'
parameter set, minimizing gradient mismatch. We evaluate our method on
CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet, and CIFAR-10 DVS, demonstrating its ability to
outperform state-of-the-art LIF-based methods. These results establish our
discretization of the QIF neuron as a compelling alternative to LIF neurons for
deep SNNs, combining richer dynamics with practical scalability.

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一个多头注意力深度交叉网络(MADCN)框架，结合特征交互建模和注意力机制，用于预测城市碳排放并研究技术因素的影响。该框架使用SHAP进行可解释性分析，在275个中国城市的数据集上验证了模型的优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 新质生产力、数字经济进步和人工智能技术对促进城市可持续发展日益重要，需要有效预测碳排放并理解技术因素的影响机制。

Method: 提出MADCN框架，结合多头注意力机制和深度交叉网络进行特征交互建模，并使用SHAP进行可解释性分析。

Result: MADCN模型在测试集上取得MSE=406,151.063、MAE=612.304、R²=0.991的优异性能，SHAP分析显示人口、城市规模、城镇化率和GDP是最主要影响因素，技术因素也有显著但相对温和的影响。

Conclusion: 推进新质生产力、加强数字经济和加速AI技术发展可显著减少城市碳排放，政策制定者应将技术创新整合到碳减排策略中，特别是通过推广智能基础设施和提升各行业数字化水平来实现双碳目标。

Abstract: New quality productive forces (NQPF), digital economy advancement, and
artificial intelligence (AI) technologies are becoming crucial for promoting
sustainable urban development. This study proposes a Multi-head Attention Deep
& Cross Network (MADCN) framework, combining feature interaction modeling and
attention mechanisms, to predict urban carbon emissions and investigate the
impacts of technological factors. The framework incorporates an interpretable
learning phase using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to assess the
contributions of different features. A panel dataset covering 275 Chinese
cities is utilized to test the MADCN model. Experimental results demonstrate
that the MADCN model achieves superior predictive performance compared to
traditional machine learning and deep learning baselines, with a Mean Squared
Error (MSE) of 406,151.063, a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 612.304, and an
R-squared value of 0.991 on the test set. SHAP analysis highlights that
population, city size, urbanization rate, and GDP are among the most
influential factors on carbon emissions, while NQPF, digital economy index, and
AI technology level also show meaningful but relatively moderate effects.
Advancing NQPF, strengthening the digital economy, and accelerating AI
technology development can significantly contribute to reducing urban carbon
emissions. Policymakers should prioritize integrating technological innovation
into carbon reduction strategies, particularly by promoting intelligent
infrastructure and enhancing digitalization across sectors, to effectively
achieve dual-carbon goals.

*Anushiya Arunan,Yan Qin,Xiaoli Li,U-Xuan Tan,H. Vincent Poor,Chau Yuen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出首个基于自监督预训练的电池容量估计模型，使用隐私友好的充电数据片段，通过片段相似性加权掩码输入重建方法学习丰富表征，在真实世界数据分布偏移下显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电动汽车电池容量准确估计对缓解消费者担忧至关重要，但隐私法规和标记数据短缺限制了通用化模型的发展。现有自监督学习方法难以从隐私友好数据中有效学习，这类数据通常特征较少且噪声更多。

Method: 提出片段相似性加权掩码输入重建预训练框架，首先利用对比学习捕获片段间高层相似性，然后进行相似性加权的掩码重建，学习细粒度充电模式和高层关联关系。

Result: 模型在制造商和老化引起的分布偏移等挑战性场景下，测试误差比最佳基准方法降低31.9%，表现优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 该方法能够从隐私友好且特征较少的数据中学习丰富表征，为电池容量估计提供了有效解决方案，在真实世界数据分布偏移下具有强鲁棒性。

Abstract: Accurate battery capacity estimation is key to alleviating consumer concerns
about battery performance and reliability of electric vehicles (EVs). However,
practical data limitations imposed by stringent privacy regulations and labeled
data shortages hamper the development of generalizable capacity estimation
models that remain robust to real-world data distribution shifts. While
self-supervised learning can leverage unlabeled data, existing techniques are
not particularly designed to learn effectively from challenging field data --
let alone from privacy-friendly data, which are often less feature-rich and
noisier. In this work, we propose a first-of-its-kind capacity estimation model
based on self-supervised pre-training, developed on a large-scale dataset of
privacy-friendly charging data snippets from real-world EV operations. Our
pre-training framework, snippet similarity-weighted masked input
reconstruction, is designed to learn rich, generalizable representations even
from less feature-rich and fragmented privacy-friendly data. Our key innovation
lies in harnessing contrastive learning to first capture high-level
similarities among fragmented snippets that otherwise lack meaningful context.
With our snippet-wise contrastive learning and subsequent similarity-weighted
masked reconstruction, we are able to learn rich representations of both
granular charging patterns within individual snippets and high-level
associative relationships across different snippets. Bolstered by this rich
representation learning, our model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines, achieving 31.9% lower test error than the best-performing benchmark,
even under challenging domain-shifted settings affected by both manufacturer
and age-induced distribution shifts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 因果注意力在Transformer模型中计算成本高昂，特别是在处理上三角或下三角矩阵乘法时，需要更高效的实现方法。

Method: FCA基于通过机器学习和组合搜索发现的代数恒等式，专门优化因果注意力中的矩阵乘法运算，包括前向和后向传播中的掩码乘积操作。

Abstract: We present Fast Causal Attention (FCA), an algorithm that computes exact
Causal Attention using 10\% fewer operations. FCA accelerates a special class
of matrix multiplications where either one operand or the output matrix is
upper- or lower-triangular. This includes all operations in forward and
backward pass of Causal Attention, such as masked product
$\mathrm{Mask}(QK^{T})$. For these matrix multiplications on GPU, FCA reaches
noticeable accelerations over the default PyTorch implementations and Triton
compiled kernels. FCA is built upon algebraic identities discovered via machine
learning and combinatorial search.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KV缓存在自回归LLM中已成为推理时的主要内存和带宽瓶颈，现有量化方法因KV分布不平坦而精度下降严重

Method: 提出PatternKV：在线挖掘代表性模式向量，将每个KV向量对齐到最近模式，仅量化残差部分，从而重塑KV分布

Result: 在多个骨干网络上，PatternKV实现一致的2位增益，4位量化仅比FP16下降0.08%，测试时扩展准确率平均提升10%，吞吐量提升1.4倍

Conclusion: PatternKV通过模式对齐残差量化有效解决了KV量化中的分布不平坦问题，显著提升了低比特量化性能

Abstract: KV cache in autoregressive LLMs eliminates redundant recomputation but has
emerged as the dominant memory and bandwidth bottleneck during inference,
notably with long contexts and test-time scaling. KV quantization is a key
lever for reducing cache cost, but accuracy drops sharply as the native KV
distribution lacks flatness and thus maintains a wide quantization range. Prior
work focuses on isolating outliers, which caps their error but fails to flatten
the overall distribution, leaving performance fragile under low-bit settings.
In this work, we show that the K cache maintains a stable structure that
evolves gradually with context, while the V cache carries latent semantic
regularities. Building on these insights, we propose PatternKV, a
pattern-aligned residual quantization scheme. It mines representative pattern
vectors online, aligns each KV vector to its nearest pattern, and quantizes
only the residual. This reshaping of the KV distribution flattens the
quantization target and narrows its range, thereby improving the fidelity of
low-bit KV quantization. Across long-context and test-time scaling settings on
multiple backbones, PatternKV delivers consistent 2-bit gains, with a 0.08%
average 4-bit drop relative to FP16, improves test-time scaling accuracy by 10%
on average, and raises throughput by 1.4x while supporting 1.25x larger
batches.

TL;DR: 提出逻辑门控算子(LGO)，在符号回归中嵌入可学习位置和陡度的可微分门控，生成具有明确阈值和物理单位的紧凑符号方程，在医疗数据上恢复临床合理的临界点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 符号回归虽然能生成可读方程，但难以编码具有单位意识的阈值和条件逻辑，需要一种能生成可审计、具有明确阈值的方法。

Method: 使用逻辑门控算子(LGO)作为类型化原语，包含可学习的位置和陡度参数，通过硬门控变体减少门控数量，保持简洁性。

Result: 在两个医疗数据集上，71%的评估阈值在指南锚点的10%范围内，100%在20%范围内，硬门控变体使用的门控数量显著少于软门控变体，同时保持与强基线相当的准确性。

Conclusion: 该方法将可解释性从后验解释转变为建模约束，为符号回归提供了实用的制度切换计算，适合治理就绪的部署。

Abstract: Symbolic regression promises readable equations but struggles to encode
unit-aware thresholds and conditional logic. We propose logistic-gated
operators (LGO) -- differentiable gates with learnable location and steepness
-- embedded as typed primitives and mapped back to physical units for audit.
Across two primary health datasets (ICU, NHANES), the hard-gate variant
recovers clinically plausible cut-points: 71% (5/7) of assessed thresholds fall
within 10% of guideline anchors and 100% within 20%, while using far fewer
gates than the soft variant (ICU median 4.0 vs 10.0; NHANES 5.0 vs 12.5), and
remaining within the competitive accuracy envelope of strong SR baselines. On
predominantly smooth tasks, gates are pruned, preserving parsimony. The result
is compact symbolic equations with explicit, unit-aware thresholds that can be
audited against clinical anchors -- turning interpretability from a post-hoc
explanation into a modeling constraint and equipping symbolic regression with a
practical calculus for regime switching and governance-ready deployment.

Conclusion: OptiFLIDS适合在真实IoT环境中部署，能有效解决联邦学习中的数据异构性和高能耗问题。

Abstract: In critical IoT environments, such as smart homes and industrial systems,
effective Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are essential for ensuring
security. However, developing robust IDS solutions remains a significant
challenge. Traditional machine learning-based IDS models typically require
large datasets, but data sharing is often limited due to privacy and security
concerns. Federated Learning (FL) presents a promising alternative by enabling
collaborative model training without sharing raw data. Despite its advantages,
FL still faces key challenges, such as data heterogeneity (non-IID data) and
high energy and computation costs, particularly for resource constrained IoT
devices. To address these issues, this paper proposes OptiFLIDS, a novel
approach that applies pruning techniques during local training to reduce model
complexity and energy consumption. It also incorporates a customized
aggregation method to better handle pruned models that differ due to non-IID
data distributions. Experiments conducted on three recent IoT IDS datasets,
TON_IoT, X-IIoTID, and IDSIoT2024, demonstrate that OptiFLIDS maintains strong
detection performance while improving energy efficiency, making it well-suited
for deployment in real-world IoT environments.

Result: 方法在合成问题和真实星系观测中均表现有效，能够从源先验中采样、评估候选源概率，并基于观测数据从源分布的联合后验中采样。

Conclusion: 扩散模型能够成功解决源分离问题，无需对源进行显式假设，仅依赖多视图观测数据即可在各种挑战性条件下工作。

Abstract: A common challenge in the natural sciences is to disentangle distinct,
unknown sources from observations. Examples of this source separation task
include deblending galaxies in a crowded field, distinguishing the activity of
individual neurons from overlapping signals, and separating seismic events from
an ambient background. Traditional analyses often rely on simplified source
models that fail to accurately reproduce the data. Recent advances have shown
that diffusion models can directly learn complex prior distributions from
noisy, incomplete data. In this work, we show that diffusion models can solve
the source separation problem without explicit assumptions about the source.
Our method relies only on multiple views, or the property that different sets
of observations contain different linear transformations of the unknown
sources. We show that our method succeeds even when no source is individually
observed and the observations are noisy, incomplete, and vary in resolution.
The learned diffusion models enable us to sample from the source priors,
evaluate the probability of candidate sources, and draw from the joint
posterior of the source distribution given an observation. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method on a range of synthetic problems as well as
real-world galaxy observations.

Motivation: 研究神经网络权重矩阵在训练过程中的分布特性，测试矩阵模型在表示这些分布时的有效性，特别是在高斯性和置换对称性假设下。

Method: 使用13参数置换不变高斯矩阵模型来分析权重矩阵的相关高斯性，计算Wasserstein距离来量化训练过程中分布的变化，并测试不同初始化策略、正则化、层深度和宽度的影响。

Result: 发现置换不变高斯矩阵模型能有效描述权重矩阵的相关高斯性，适用范围远超简单高斯模型和初始化阶段。表示论模型参数和图论特征为最佳拟合模型提供了可解释框架。

Conclusion: 置换不变高斯矩阵模型为神经网络权重分布提供了有效的描述框架，能够识别高斯性的偏离，并为开发更通用且可解释的模型奠定了基础。

Abstract: Ensembles of neural network weight matrices are studied through the training
process for the MNIST classification problem, testing the efficacy of matrix
models for representing their distributions, under assumptions of Gaussianity
and permutation-symmetry. The general 13-parameter permutation invariant
Gaussian matrix models are found to be effective models for the correlated
Gaussianity in the weight matrices, beyond the range of applicability of the
simple Gaussian with independent identically distributed matrix variables, and
notably well beyond the initialisation step. The representation theoretic model
parameters, and the graph-theoretic characterisation of the permutation
invariant matrix observables give an interpretable framework for the best-fit
model and for small departures from Gaussianity. Additionally, the Wasserstein
distance is calculated for this class of models and used to quantify the
movement of the distributions over training. Throughout the work, the effects
of varied initialisation regimes, regularisation, layer depth, and layer width
are tested for this formalism, identifying limits where particular departures
from Gaussianity are enhanced and how more general, yet still
highly-interpretable, models can be developed.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable progress in coding and
math problem-solving, but evaluation on advanced research-level problems in
hard sciences remains scarce. To fill this gap, we present CMT-Benchmark, a
dataset of 50 problems covering condensed matter theory (CMT) at the level of
an expert researcher. Topics span analytical and computational approaches in
quantum many-body, and classical statistical mechanics. The dataset was
designed and verified by a panel of expert researchers from around the world.
We built the dataset through a collaborative environment that challenges the
panel to write and refine problems they would want a research assistant to
solve, including Hartree-Fock, exact diagonalization, quantum/variational Monte
Carlo, density matrix renormalization group (DMRG), quantum/classical
statistical mechanics, and model building. We evaluate LLMs by programmatically
checking solutions against expert-supplied ground truth. We developed
machine-grading, including symbolic handling of non-commuting operators via
normal ordering. They generalize across tasks too. Our evaluations show that
frontier models struggle with all of the problems in the dataset, highlighting
a gap in the physical reasoning skills of current LLMs. Notably, experts
identified strategies for creating increasingly difficult problems by
interacting with the LLMs and exploiting common failure modes. The best model,
GPT5, solves 30\% of the problems; average across 17 models (GPT, Gemini,
Claude, DeepSeek, Llama) is 11.4$\pm$2.1\%. Moreover, 18 problems are solved by
none of the 17 models, and 26 by at most one. These unsolved problems span
Quantum Monte Carlo, Variational Monte Carlo, and DMRG. Answers sometimes
violate fundamental symmetries or have unphysical scaling dimensions. We
believe this benchmark will guide development toward capable AI research
assistants and tutors.

Motivation: 现有研究假设参数完全已知或预估计，但实际中参数需要从数据中学习。本文提出一个更灵活的问题类别，将优化和学习统一到一个框架中。

Method: 基于加速原始对偶方法提出两种算法：直接替换参数估计的朴素扩展，以及考虑参数动态调整动量更新的学习感知变体。

Result: 两种方法都达到O(log K/K)的收敛率，学习感知方法具有更紧的O(1)常数和自适应步长选择。在结构化设置中改进算法达到O(1/√K)的收敛率。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在误设定投资组合优化问题上表现出优于现有算法的实证性能，为同时进行优化和学习的统一框架提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We study a class of misspecified saddle point (SP) problems, where the
optimization objective depends on an unknown parameter that must be learned
concurrently from data. Unlike existing studies that assume parameters are
fully known or pre-estimated, our framework integrates optimization and
learning into a unified formulation, enabling a more flexible problem class. To
address this setting, we propose two algorithms based on the accelerated
primal-dual (APD) by Hamedani & Aybat 2021. In particular, we first analyze the
naive extension of the APD method by directly substituting the evolving
parameter estimates into the primal-dual updates; then, we design a new
learning-aware variant of the APD method that explicitly accounts for parameter
dynamics by adjusting the momentum updates. Both methods achieve a provable
convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(\log K / K)$, while the learning-aware
approach attains a tighter $\mathcal{O}(1)$ constant and further benefits from
an adaptive step-size selection enabled by a backtracking strategy.
Furthermore, we extend the framework to problems where the learning problem
admits multiple optimal solutions, showing that our modified algorithm for a
structured setting achieves an $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{K})$ rate. To demonstrate
practical impact, we evaluate our methods on a misspecified portfolio
optimization problem and show superior empirical performance compared to
state-of-the-art algorithms.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个组合框架来计算深度前馈神经网络的Lipschitz常数，通过分解大型SDP为小规模子问题，实现线性计算复杂度，并提供局部信息整合的算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算神经网络Lipschitz常数是NP难问题，现有方法需要求解大型矩阵半定规划，计算复杂度高且难以扩展到大型网络。需要开发可扩展且能利用局部信息提供更紧估计的方法。

Method: 开发了通用SDP框架，支持异质激活函数斜率和任意输入-输出对。将该SDP分解为一系列小规模子问题，计算复杂度与网络深度呈线性关系。还开发了通过闭式解实现瞬时计算的变体。

Result: 实验表明，相比多种基准方法，所提算法实现了显著加速，同时产生比全局方法更紧的Lipschitz边界。当输入区域足够小时，算法提供的上界接近自动微分得到的精确Jacobian值。

Conclusion: 所提方法不仅计算效率高，而且Lipschitz估计与网络鲁棒性密切相关，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: The Lipschitz constant is a key measure for certifying the robustness of
neural networks to input perturbations. However, computing the exact constant
is NP-hard, and standard approaches to estimate the Lipschitz constant involve
solving a large matrix semidefinite program (SDP) that scales poorly with
network size. Further, there is a potential to efficiently leverage local
information on the input region to provide tighter Lipschitz estimates. We
address this problem here by proposing a compositional framework that yields
tight yet scalable Lipschitz estimates for deep feedforward neural networks.
Specifically, we begin by developing a generalized SDP framework that is highly
flexible, accommodating heterogeneous activation function slope, and allowing
Lipschitz estimates with respect to arbitrary input-output pairs and arbitrary
choices of sub-networks of consecutive layers. We then decompose this
generalized SDP into a sequence of small sub-problems, with computational
complexity that scales linearly with respect to the network depth. We also
develop a variant that achieves near-instantaneous computation through
closed-form solutions to each sub-problem. All our algorithms are accompanied
by theoretical guarantees on feasibility and validity. Next, we develop a
series of algorithms, termed as ECLipsE-Gen-Local, that effectively incorporate
local information on the input. Our experiments demonstrate that our algorithms
achieve substantial speedups over a multitude of benchmarks while producing
significantly tighter Lipschitz bounds than global approaches. Moreover, we
show that our algorithms provide strict upper bounds for the Lipschitz constant
with values approaching the exact Jacobian from autodiff when the input region
is small enough. Finally, we demonstrate the practical utility of our approach
by showing that our Lipschitz estimates closely align with network robustness.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文通过消融研究比较了编码器专用模型和解码器专用模型在跨模态适应任务中的表现，发现解码器专用模型表现较差，并提出两种新方法（并行翻转和序列加倍）来提升其性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管解码器专用模型在自然语言处理中表现优异且扩展性好，但大多数跨模态适应方法专注于编码器专用模型，因此需要研究模型架构对这些方法的影响。

Method: 进行了一系列消融研究，系统比较编码器专用和解码器专用模型在基于偏微分方程的时间相关模拟任务中的跨模态适应表现，并提出了并行翻转和序列加倍两种新方法。

Result: 发现直接应用现有方法时，解码器专用模型表现远不如编码器专用模型，且扩展模型规模也无帮助。但提出的两种新方法在所有任务和跨模态适应方法中都提升了解码器专用模型的性能，缩小了与编码器专用模型的差距。

Conclusion: 解码器专用模型在跨模态适应任务中具有潜力，但需要专门的方法来发挥其优势。提出的两种方法有效提升了性能，有望拓宽科学机器学习中使用的模型范围。

Abstract: Large language models have shown great success on natural language tasks in
recent years, but they have also shown great promise when adapted to new
modalities, e.g., for scientific machine learning tasks. Even though
decoder-only models are more popular within NLP and scale exceedingly well at
generating natural language, most proposed approaches for cross-modal
adaptation focus on encoder-only models, raising the question of how model
architecture affects these approaches. In this paper, we therefore perform a
series of ablation studies to answer this question, systematically comparing
encoder-only and decoder-only models on cross-modal adaptation for
time-dependent simulation tasks based on partial differential equations (PDEs).
We find that decoder-only models are far worse than encoder-only models, when
existing approaches are applied unmodified. In contrast to several other
domains, scaling decoder-only models also does not help. To harness the
potential of decoder-only models in this context, we introduce two novel
approaches, Parallel Flipping and Sequence Doubling, attempting to mimic
bidirectionality in autoregressive models. Both our methods improve overall
performance using decoder-only models for all tasks and all cross-model
adaptation methods, closing the gap to encoder-only model performance. We hope
that our findings broaden the spectrum of models used on cross-modal adaptation
tasks to further scientific ML.

TL;DR: 提出Action Gradient方法，通过直接调整动作来改进Decision Transformer，解决轨迹拼接和外推问题，显著提升性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Decision Transformer将强化学习与transformer结合，但存在轨迹拼接和动作外推两大挑战。现有方法单独解决这些问题但组合时性能不稳定

Method: 提出Action Gradient方法，利用Q值对动作的梯度来优化动作，实现类似策略梯度的功能，并能与token预测技术高效集成

Result: 实验结果表明该方法能显著提升DT-based算法的性能，部分结果达到最先进水平

Conclusion: Action Gradient方法有效解决了DT的挑战，为离线强化学习提供了稳定高效的改进方案

Abstract: Decision Transformer (DT), which integrates reinforcement learning (RL) with
the transformer model, introduces a novel approach to offline RL. Unlike
classical algorithms that take maximizing cumulative discounted rewards as
objective, DT instead maximizes the likelihood of actions. This paradigm shift,
however, presents two key challenges: stitching trajectories and extrapolation
of action. Existing methods, such as substituting specific tokens with
predictive values and integrating the Policy Gradient (PG) method, address
these challenges individually but fail to improve performance stably when
combined due to inherent instability. To address this, we propose Action
Gradient (AG), an innovative methodology that directly adjusts actions to
fulfill a function analogous to that of PG, while also facilitating efficient
integration with token prediction techniques. AG utilizes the gradient of the
Q-value with respect to the action to optimize the action. The empirical
results demonstrate that our method can significantly enhance the performance
of DT-based algorithms, with some results achieving state-of-the-art levels.

Motivation: 研究深度神经网络中符号图的挫败度，以了解网络的结构平衡性和功能行为特征。

Method: 通过计算深度卷积神经网络的符号图挫败度，并与零模型进行比较，从统计物理和功能角度分析网络行为。

Result: 所有预训练的深度CNN的挫败度都低于零模型预期，表明网络具有更接近结构平衡的状态和更有序的行为。

Conclusion: 深度卷积神经网络倾向于表现出比预期更有序的行为，这暗示了一种新的隐含正则化形式。

Abstract: For the signed graph associated to a deep neural network, one can compute the
frustration level, i.e., test how close or distant the graph is to structural
balance. For all the pretrained deep convolutional neural networks we consider,
we find that the frustration is always less than expected from null models.
From a statistical physics point of view, and in particular in reference to an
Ising spin glass model, the reduced frustration indicates that the amount of
disorder encoded in the network is less than in the null models. From a
functional point of view, low frustration (i.e., proximity to structural
balance) means that the function representing the network behaves
near-monotonically, i.e., more similarly to a monotone function than in the
null models. Evidence of near-monotonic behavior along the partial order
determined by frustration is observed for all networks we consider. This
confirms that the class of deep convolutional neural networks tends to have a
more ordered behavior than expected from null models, and suggests a novel form
of implicit regularization.

Method: 引入可适应梯度裁剪和其他工程增强到标准DP-Adam优化器，创建DP-Adam-AC。使用该优化器对两种本地化LLM设计（小语言模型Qwen2.5-0.5B和1.58位量化模型Bitnet-b1.58-2B）进行微调。

Result: 通过两个合成数据集的实验，展示了损失方面的有前景的改进。

Conclusion: 通过增强差分隐私优化算法和本地化语言模型的结合，有效解决了LLMs的安全问题，为在消费级设备上安全部署语言模型提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT have evolved into powerful and
ubiquitous tools. Fine-tuning on small datasets allows LLMs to acquire
specialized skills for specific tasks efficiently. Although LLMs provide great
utility in both general and task-specific use cases, they are limited by two
security-related concerns. First, traditional LLM hardware requirements make
them infeasible to run locally on consumer-grade devices. A remote network
connection with the LLM provider's server is usually required, making the
system vulnerable to network attacks. Second, fine-tuning an LLM for a
sensitive task may involve sensitive data. Non-private fine-tuning algorithms
produce models vulnerable to training data reproduction attacks. Our work
addresses these security concerns by enhancing differentially private
optimization algorithms and applying them to fine-tune localizable language
models. We introduce adaptable gradient clipping along with other engineering
enhancements to the standard DP-Adam optimizer to create DP-Adam-AC. We use our
optimizer to fine-tune examples of two localizable LLM designs, small language
model (Qwen2.5-0.5B) and 1.58 bit quantization (Bitnet-b1.58-2B). We
demonstrate promising improvements in loss through experimentation with two
synthetic datasets.

Abstract: We study the cosine similarity of sentence transformer embeddings and observe
that they are well modeled by gamma mixtures. From a fixed corpus, we measure
similarities between all document embeddings and a reference query embedding.
Empirically we find that these distributions are often well captured by a gamma
distribution shifted and truncated to [-1,1], and in many cases, by a gamma
mixture. We propose a heuristic model in which a hierarchical clustering of
topics naturally leads to a gamma-mixture structure in the similarity scores.
Finally, we outline an expectation-maximization algorithm for fitting shifted
gamma mixtures, which provides a practical tool for modeling similarity
distributions.

Result: 大量实验表明，所提方法相比现有正则化方法显著提升了对抗鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 通过重新设计正则化策略，可以有效解决MSE在对抗训练中的局限性，提升模型鲁棒性。

Abstract: Adversarial training is the most effective defense against adversarial
attacks. The effectiveness of the adversarial attacks has been on the design of
its loss function and regularization term. The most widely used loss function
in adversarial training is cross-entropy and mean squared error (MSE) as its
regularization objective. However, MSE enforces overly uniform optimization
between two output distributions during training, which limits its robustness
in adversarial training scenarios. To address this issue, we revisit the idea
of mutual learning (originally designed for knowledge distillation) and propose
two novel regularization strategies tailored for adversarial training: (i)
weighted adversarial mutual regularization and (ii) adversarial generalization
regularization. In the former, we formulate a decomposed adversarial mutual
Kullback-Leibler divergence (KL-divergence) loss, which allows flexible control
over the optimization process by assigning unequal weights to the main and
auxiliary objectives. In the latter, we introduce an additional clean target
distribution into the adversarial training objective, improving generalization
and enhancing model robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
proposed methods significantly improve adversarial robustness compared to
existing regularization-based approaches.

Conclusion: TRNN成功统一了张量回归和神经网络两种范式，为高维张量数据的非线性建模提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Modern sensing and metrology systems now stream terabytes of heterogeneous,
high-dimensional (HD) data profiles, images, and dense point clouds, whose
natural representation is multi-way tensors. Understanding such data requires
regression models that preserve tensor geometry, yet remain expressive enough
to capture the pronounced nonlinear interactions that dominate many industrial
and mechanical processes. Existing tensor-based regressors meet the first
requirement but remain essentially linear. Conversely, conventional neural
networks offer nonlinearity only after flattening, thereby discarding spatial
structure and incurring prohibitive parameter counts. This paper introduces a
Tensor-on-Tensor Regression Neural Network (TRNN) that unifies these two
paradigms.

TL;DR: MADPO是一种改进的偏好优化方法，通过实例级自适应温度调节解决DPO固定温度参数的问题，在情感生成任务中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统DPO方法使用固定温度参数，在多样化偏好数据上训练效果不佳，容易对简单样本过拟合而对信息丰富样本学习不足。现有改进方法如IPO和β-DPO各有局限性。

Method: 采用两步法：首先训练奖励模型估计偏好边界，然后使用这些边界为每个训练样本的DPO损失应用连续自适应权重，对困难样本放大学习信号，对简单样本抑制学习信号。

Result: 在情感生成任务中，MADPO在所有数据集上显著优于强基线方法，在高质量数据上性能提升达+33.3%，在低质量数据上提升+10.5%。

Conclusion: MADPO为偏好对齐提供了一种更稳健和原则性的方法，具有良好优化的优化景观和对奖励模型估计误差的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as a simple and effective
method for aligning large language models. However, its reliance on a fixed
temperature parameter leads to suboptimal training on diverse preference data,
causing overfitting on easy examples and under-learning from informative ones.
Recent methods have emerged to counter this. While IPO addresses general
overfitting, its uniform regularization can be overly conservative. The more
targeted approach of $\beta$-DPO suffers from its own limitations: its
batch-level adaptation applies a single, compromised temperature to
mixed-margin pairs, its linear update rule can produce unstable negative
$\beta$ values, and its filtering mechanism discards potentially useful
training signals. In this work, we introduce Margin-Adaptive Direct Preference
Optimization (MADPO), a method that provides a stable, data-preserving, and
instance-level solution. MADPO employs a practical two-step approach: it first
trains a reward model to estimate preference margins and then uses these
margins to apply a continuous, adaptive weight to the DPO loss for each
individual training sample. This re-weighting scheme creates an effective
target margin that is amplified for hard pairs and dampened for easy pairs,
allowing for granular control over the learning signal. We provide a
comprehensive theoretical analysis, proving that MADPO has a well-behaved
optimization landscape and is robust to reward model estimation errors. We
validate our theory with experiments on a sentiment generation task, where
MADPO consistently and significantly outperforms strong baselines across
datasets of varying quality. It achieves performance gains of up to +33.3\% on
High Quality data and +10.5\% on Low Quality data over the next-best method.
Our results establish MADPO as a more robust and principled approach to
preference alignment.

Abstract: We propose Physics-informed Attention-enhanced Fourier Neural Operator
(PIANO) to solve the Nonlinear Force-Free Field (NLFFF) problem in solar
physics. Unlike conventional approaches that rely on iterative numerical
methods, our proposed PIANO directly learns the 3D magnetic field structure
from 2D boundary conditions. Specifically, PIANO integrates Efficient Channel
Attention (ECA) mechanisms with Dilated Convolutions (DC), which enhances the
model's ability to capture multimodal input by prioritizing critical channels
relevant to the magnetic field's variations. Furthermore, we apply
physics-informed loss by enforcing the force-free and divergence-free
conditions in the training process so that our prediction is consistent with
underlying physics with high accuracy. Experimental results on the ISEE NLFFF
dataset show that our PIANO not only outperforms state-of-the-art neural
operators in terms of accuracy but also shows strong consistency with the

TL;DR: 提出MT-DAO优化器，通过多时间尺度的动量机制解决分布式训练中通信频率与自适应优化器性能不匹配的问题，显著提升训练效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分布式数据并行训练中，频繁的梯度通信会占用大量带宽。虽然降低通信频率的策略（如Local SGD）可以减少开销，但在自适应优化器中会出现性能下降。这主要是由于优化器的快速动量衰减与长间隔梯度更新不匹配，导致噪声主导优化过程。

Method: 提出MT-DAO优化器家族，采用多个慢速和快速移动的一阶动量来跟踪不同时间尺度的更新动态，并提供了首个收敛性保证。

Result: 在语言模型预训练中，MT-DAO消除了与DDP的性能差距，在困惑度上优于低频通信基线，在以太网互连上将等token训练时间减少了6-27%。在720M规模下，达到目标困惑度所需的步数减少24%，时间减少35%。

Conclusion: MT-DAO能够实现有效的跨数据中心训练和广域地理范围的训练，解决了分布式训练中通信效率与优化性能的平衡问题。

Abstract: Training large models with distributed data parallelism (DDP) requires
frequent communication of gradients across workers, which can saturate
bandwidth. Infrequent communication strategies (e.g., Local SGD) reduce this
overhead but, when applied to adaptive optimizers, often suffer a performance
gap relative to fully synchronous DDP. We trace this gap to a time-scale
mismatch: the optimizer's fast-moving momentum, tuned for frequent updates,
decays too quickly to smooth gradients over long intervals, leading to
noise-dominated optimization. To address this, we propose MT-DAO, a family of
optimizers that employs multiple slow- and fast-moving first momenta or the
gradient to track update dynamics across different time scales, for which we
provide the first convergence guarantees. Empirically, for language-model
pre-training, this eliminates the performance gap with DDP, outperforming
infrequent-communication baselines in perplexity and reducing iso-token
wall-clock time by 6-27% on Ethernet interconnects. At the 720M scale, MT-DAO
reaches a target perplexity in 24% fewer steps and 35% less time than the
single-momentum DDP baseline. MT-DAO enables effective cross-datacenter
training and training over wide geographic areas.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KV缓存量化到极低精度（如2位）会引入显著误差，通过注意力机制传播并降低生成质量，需要解决这一问题。

Method: 结合Hadamard旋转减少值量化误差，使用轻量级线性校正适配器补偿量化键引入的误差。

Result: 在LLaMA、Qwen2.5和Qwen3模型上，KVLinC持续匹配或超越强基线，实现更高的KV缓存压缩，推理速度比Flash Attention快2.55倍。

Conclusion: KVLinC有效缓解了极低精度KV缓存量化的注意力误差，在保持生成质量的同时实现了高效的长上下文LLM推理。

Abstract: Quantizing the key-value (KV) cache is a promising strategy for improving the
inference efficiency of large language models (LLMs). However, aggressive
quantization to very low precision (e.g., 2 bits) introduces significant errors
in the stored key and value tensors, which propagate through the dot-product
attention mechanism and ultimately degrade generation quality. To address this,
we propose KVLinC, a framework to mitigate attention errors introduced by KV
cache quantization in the extreme low-precision regime. KVLinC combines a
Hadamard rotation, which reduces quantization error in values, with lightweight
linear correction adapters that explicitly compensate for errors introduced by
quantized keys. Across extensive evaluations on the LLaMA, Qwen2.5, and Qwen3
model families, KVLinC consistently matches or surpasses strong baselines while
achieving higher KV-cache compression. Furthermore, we implement a custom
attention kernel that results in upto 2.55x faster inference compared to Flash
Attention baseline, enabling efficient long-context LLM inference.

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are a useful framework for
approximating partial differential equation solutions using deep learning
methods. In this paper, we propose a principled redesign of the PINNsformer, a
Transformer-based PINN architecture. We present the Spectral PINNSformer
(S-Pformer), a refinement of encoder-decoder PINNSformers that addresses two
key issues; 1. the redundancy (i.e. increased parameter count) of the encoder,
and 2. the mitigation of spectral bias. We find that the encoder is unnecessary
for capturing spatiotemporal correlations when relying solely on
self-attention, thereby reducing parameter count. Further, we integrate Fourier
feature embeddings to explicitly mitigate spectral bias, enabling adaptive
encoding of multiscale behaviors in the frequency domain. Our model outperforms
encoder-decoder PINNSformer architectures across all benchmarks, achieving or
outperforming MLP performance while reducing parameter count significantly.

Conclusion: 提出的随机特征神经网络方法为KL散度估计提供了理论保证的低误差算法，解决了传统方法在高维大数据场景下的性能问题。

Abstract: Estimating the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between random variables is a
fundamental problem in statistical analysis. For continuous random variables,
traditional information-theoretic estimators scale poorly with dimension and/or
sample size. To mitigate this challenge, a variety of methods have been
proposed to estimate KL divergences and related quantities, such as mutual
information, using neural networks. The existing theoretical analyses show that
neural network parameters achieving low error exist. However, since they rely
on non-constructive neural network approximation theorems, they do not
guarantee that the existing algorithms actually achieve low error. In this
paper, we propose a KL divergence estimation algorithm using a shallow neural
network with randomized hidden weights and biases (i.e. a random feature
method). We show that with high probability, the algorithm achieves a KL
divergence estimation error of $O(m^{-1/2}+T^{-1/3})$, where $m$ is the number
of neurons and $T$ is both the number of steps of the algorithm and the number
of samples.

Abstract: Accurate and efficient temperature prediction is critical for optimizing the
preheating process of PET preforms in industrial microwave systems prior to
blow molding. We propose a novel deep learning framework for generalized
temperature prediction. Unlike traditional models that require extensive
retraining for each material or design variation, our method introduces a
data-efficient neural architecture that leverages transfer learning and model
fusion to generalize across unseen scenarios. By pretraining specialized neural
regressor on distinct conditions such as recycled PET heat capacities or
varying preform geometries and integrating their representations into a unified
global model, we create a system capable of learning shared thermal dynamics
across heterogeneous inputs. The architecture incorporates skip connections to
enhance stability and prediction accuracy. Our approach reduces the need for
large simulation datasets while achieving superior performance compared to
models trained from scratch. Experimental validation on two case studies
material variability and geometric diversity demonstrates significant
improvements in generalization, establishing a scalable ML-based solution for
intelligent thermal control in manufacturing environments. Moreover, the
approach highlights how data-efficient generalization strategies can extend to
other industrial applications involving complex physical modeling with limited
data.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文探索使用基于LSTM的seq2seq深度学习模型来预测太阳质子事件后24小时的质子通量时间剖面，通过多种预测场景比较发现单次预测优于自回归预测，趋势平滑处理能提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 太阳质子事件对卫星、宇航员和技术系统构成严重辐射危害，准确预测其质子通量时间剖面对于早期预警和缓解措施至关重要。

Method: 使用40个SPE事件数据集，采用4折分层交叉验证评估不同seq2seq模型配置，包括：仅质子输入vs质子+X射线输入、原始通量数据vs趋势平滑数据、自回归vs单次预测。

Result: 单次预测误差低于自回归预测；原始数据上仅质子模型表现更好，但趋势平滑后质子+X射线模型性能提升；趋势平滑显著改善质子+X射线模型性能；虽然趋势平滑数据训练模型平均表现最佳，但最佳模型是在原始数据上训练的。

Conclusion: LSTM seq2seq模型能有效预测SPE质子通量，单次预测策略和适当的数据预处理能显著提升预测精度，但模型架构选择有时比数据预处理更重要。

Abstract: Solar Proton Events (SPEs) cause significant radiation hazards to satellites,
astronauts, and technological systems. Accurate forecasting of their proton
flux time profiles is crucial for early warnings and mitigation. This paper
explores deep learning sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models based on Long
Short-Term Memory networks to predict 24-hour proton flux profiles following
SPE onsets. We used a dataset of 40 well-connected SPEs (1997-2017) observed by
NOAA GOES, each associated with a >=M-class western-hemisphere solar flare and
undisturbed proton flux profiles. Using 4-fold stratified cross-validation, we
evaluate seq2seq model configurations (varying hidden units and embedding
dimensions) under multiple forecasting scenarios: (i) proton-only input vs.
combined proton+X-ray input, (ii) original flux data vs. trend-smoothed data,
and (iii) autoregressive vs. one-shot forecasting. Our major results are as
follows: First, one-shot forecasting consistently yields lower error than
autoregressive prediction, avoiding the error accumulation seen in iterative
approaches. Second, on the original data, proton-only models outperform
proton+X-ray models. However, with trend-smoothed data, this gap narrows or
reverses in proton+X-ray models. Third, trend-smoothing significantly enhances
the performance of proton+X-ray models by mitigating fluctuations in the X-ray
channel. Fourth, while models trained on trendsmoothed data perform best on
average, the best-performing model was trained on original data, suggesting
that architectural choices can sometimes outweigh the benefits of data
preprocessing.

TL;DR: 提出了NoiseCurve方法，利用公开无标签数据估计模型曲率来改进DP-MF中的跨迭代噪声相关性，在保持差分隐私的同时显著提升DP-SGD的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前DP-SGD与普通SGD训练存在较大的准确性差距，需要改进隐私保护训练方法。DP-MF通过关联随机梯度下降不同迭代间的隐私噪声来提升性能，但噪声相关性质量有待改进。

Method: 使用公开无标签数据估计模型曲率，基于曲率信息改进DP-MF中的跨迭代噪声相关性计算，提出NoiseCurve技术。

Result: 在各种数据集、模型和隐私参数下的实验表明，NoiseCurve计算的噪声相关性相比DP-MF的相关方案在准确性上获得了持续且显著的改进。

Conclusion: NoiseCurve通过利用模型曲率信息有效改进了DP-MF中的噪声相关性，为差分隐私深度学习训练提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD) offers the
promise of training deep learning models while mitigating many privacy risks.
However, there is currently a large accuracy gap between DP-SGD and normal SGD
training. This has resulted in different lines of research investigating
orthogonal ways of improving privacy-preserving training. One such line of
work, known as DP-MF, correlates the privacy noise across different iterations
of stochastic gradient descent -- allowing later iterations to cancel out some
of the noise added to earlier iterations. In this paper, we study how to
improve this noise correlation. We propose a technique called NoiseCurve that
uses model curvature, estimated from public unlabeled data, to improve the
quality of this cross-iteration noise correlation. Our experiments on various
datasets, models, and privacy parameters show that the noise correlations
computed by NoiseCurve offer consistent and significant improvements in
accuracy over the correlation scheme used by DP-MF.

TL;DR: DVI是一个训练感知的自推测解码框架，通过将LLM划分为起草器和验证器，在推理过程中进行持续在线学习，实现无损加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归解码是大型语言模型的主要延迟瓶颈，现有推测解码方法需要大量离线训练或额外组件，成本高且容易受分布漂移影响。

Method: 将LLM划分为起草器和验证器，在生成过程中将验证器的接受/拒绝决策转化为监督信号来更新起草器头，采用KL→RL调度策略进行在线蒸馏和策略梯度优化。

Result: 在Spec-Bench上实现2.16倍加速，与EAGLE-2等最先进方法相当，但训练数据量少几个数量级。

Conclusion: 训练感知的自推测方法能以最小训练开销实现最先进的无损加速。

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) decoding is a major latency bottleneck for large language
models. Speculative decoding (SD) accelerates AR by letting a drafter propose
multi-token blocks that a verifier accepts or rejects. However, many SD systems
require heavy offline training or extra components. These choices raise
data/compute cost and can yield brittle drafters under distribution drift. We
introduce \emph{Draft, Verify, \& Improve (DVI)}, a training-aware
self-speculative framework that combines inference with continual online
learning. We partition an LLM into a drafter and a verifier, and during
generation, verifier accept/reject decisions are converted into supervision
signals and used to update the drafter head. A simple \emph{KL$\rightarrow$RL}
schedule bootstraps calibration via online distillation and then adds
reward-masked cross-entropy with a on-policy policy-gradient term, preserving
lossless, single model deployment. On Spec-Bench, DVI achieves a $2.16\times$
wall-time speedup, on par with SoTA approaches like EAGLE-2, while orders of
magnitude less data for training, and ablations show that DVI outperforms
KL-only online distillation. DVI demonstrates that \emph{training-aware}
self-speculation can deliver state-of-the-art, lossless speedups with minimal
training overhead.

Motivation: 传统黑盒学习方法在生物医学建模中存在局限性，需要整合物理定律与数据驱动方法来解决物理可解释性、数据稀缺和复杂系统建模的挑战。

Method: 回顾了三种主要PIML框架：物理信息神经网络（PINNs）嵌入控制方程，神经常微分方程（NODEs）提供连续时间建模，神经算子（NOs）学习函数空间映射。

Result: 这些方法已成功应用于生物固体和流体力学、力学生物学、医学成像、生理系统动力学、药代动力学和细胞信号传导等多个生物医学领域。

Conclusion: PIML在生物医学科学和工程中具有广阔前景，但仍需解决不确定性量化、泛化能力以及与大型语言模型集成等开放挑战。

Abstract: Physics-informed machine learning (PIML) is emerging as a potentially
transformative paradigm for modeling complex biomedical systems by integrating
parameterized physical laws with data-driven methods. Here, we review three
main classes of PIML frameworks: physics-informed neural networks (PINNs),
neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs), and neural operators (NOs),
highlighting their growing role in biomedical science and engineering. We begin
with PINNs, which embed governing equations into deep learning models and have
been successfully applied to biosolid and biofluid mechanics, mechanobiology,
and medical imaging among other areas. We then review NODEs, which offer
continuous-time modeling, especially suited to dynamic physiological systems,
pharmacokinetics, and cell signaling. Finally, we discuss deep NOs as powerful
tools for learning mappings between function spaces, enabling efficient
simulations across multiscale and spatially heterogeneous biological domains.
Throughout, we emphasize applications where physical interpretability, data
scarcity, or system complexity make conventional black-box learning
insufficient. We conclude by identifying open challenges and future directions
for advancing PIML in biomedical science and engineering, including issues of
uncertainty quantification, generalization, and integration of PIML and large
language models.

TL;DR: ARLAS框架通过对抗性强化学习训练LLM代理，使其能抵御多样化的间接提示注入攻击，同时保持任务完成能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM代理使用工具时面临间接提示注入攻击风险，现有防御方法依赖手动构建的攻击数据集，缺乏多样性，无法应对新型攻击。

Method: 提出ARLAS框架，将问题建模为双人零和博弈，同时训练攻击者LLM（生成多样化提示注入）和代理LLM（防御攻击并完成任务），采用基于种群的学习框架防止循环学习。

Result: 在BrowserGym和AgentDojo上的评估显示，ARLAS微调的代理攻击成功率显著降低，同时任务成功率提高，生成的攻击集多样且具有挑战性。

Conclusion: ARLAS通过对抗性学习生成多样化攻击，能训练出比基础模型更鲁棒的LLM代理，有效提升安全性。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents can leverage tools such as Google Search to
complete complex tasks. However, this tool usage introduces the risk of
indirect prompt injections, where malicious instructions hidden in tool outputs
can manipulate the agent, posing security risks like data leakage. Current
defense strategies typically rely on fine-tuning LLM agents on datasets of
known attacks. However, the generation of these datasets relies on manually
crafted attack patterns, which limits their diversity and leaves agents
vulnerable to novel prompt injections. To address this limitation, we propose
Adversarial Reinforcement Learning for Agent Safety (ARLAS), a novel framework
that leverages adversarial reinforcement learning (RL) by formulating the
problem as a two-player zero-sum game. ARLAS co-trains two LLMs: an attacker
that learns to autonomously generate diverse prompt injections and an agent
that learns to defend against them while completing its assigned tasks. To
ensure robustness against a wide range of attacks and to prevent cyclic
learning, we employ a population-based learning framework that trains the agent
to defend against all previous attacker checkpoints. Evaluated on BrowserGym
and AgentDojo, agents fine-tuned with ARLAS achieve a significantly lower
attack success rate than the original model while also improving their task
success rate. Our analysis further confirms that the adversarial process
generates a diverse and challenging set of attacks, leading to a more robust
agent compared to the base model.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文研究了在有限时域MDP中的元强化学习，提出了两种基于Thompson采样的算法来学习Q函数的先验分布，并提供了元遗憾的理论保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在元强化学习中，相关任务通常具有相似的最优动作价值函数结构。通过利用这种结构，可以更有效地学习新任务，特别是在任务数量较多时超越独立学习的方法。

Method: 提出了两种Thompson风格的算法：MTSRL（仅学习先验均值）和MTSRL+（额外学习协方差并使用先验扩展技术）。采用随机价值函数和先验对齐技术来保证性能。

Result: 在已知协方差情况下获得O~(H^4S^3/2√ANK)的元遗憾，在学习协方差情况下获得O~(H^4S^3/2√AN^3K)。当任务数量足够多时，性能优于独立Thompson采样。

Conclusion: 这是首个为具有学习Q先验的Thompson风格RL提供元遗憾保证的工作，为实验丰富的环境提供了实用的算法方案。

Abstract: We study meta-reinforcement learning in finite-horizon MDPs where related
tasks share similar structures in their optimal action-value functions.
Specifically, we posit a linear representation
$Q^*_h(s,a)=\Phi_h(s,a)\,\theta^{(k)}_h$ and place a Gaussian meta-prior $
\mathcal{N}(\theta^*_h,\Sigma^*_h)$ over the task-specific parameters
$\theta^{(k)}_h$. Building on randomized value functions, we propose two
Thompson-style algorithms: (i) MTSRL, which learns only the prior mean and
performs posterior sampling with the learned mean and known covariance; and
(ii) $\text{MTSRL}^{+}$, which additionally estimates the covariance and
employs prior widening to control finite-sample estimation error. Further, we
develop a prior-alignment technique that couples the posterior under the
learned prior with a meta-oracle that knows the true prior, yielding
meta-regret guarantees: we match prior-independent Thompson sampling in the
small-task regime and strictly improve with more tasks once the prior is
learned. Concretely, for known covariance we obtain
$\tilde{O}(H^{4}S^{3/2}\sqrt{ANK})$ meta-regret, and with learned covariance
$\tilde{O}(H^{4}S^{3/2}\sqrt{AN^3K})$; both recover a better behavior than
prior-independent after $K \gtrsim \tilde{O}(H^2)$ and $K \gtrsim
\tilde{O}(N^2H^2)$, respectively. Simulations on a stateful recommendation
environment (with feature and prior misspecification) show that after brief
exploration, MTSRL/MTSRL\(^+\) track the meta-oracle and substantially
outperform prior-independent RL and bandit-only meta-baselines. Our results
give the first meta-regret guarantees for Thompson-style RL with learned
Q-priors, and provide practical recipes (warm-start via RLSVI, OLS aggregation,
covariance widening) for experiment-rich settings.

Conclusion: Quantile DeepGR4J框架适合作为洪水预警系统，能够有效量化径流预测不确定性并识别洪水风险。

Abstract: Conceptual rainfall-runoff models aid hydrologists and climate scientists in
modelling streamflow to inform water management practices. Recent advances in
deep learning have unravelled the potential for combining hydrological models
with deep learning models for better interpretability and improved predictive
performance. In our previous work, we introduced DeepGR4J, which enhanced the
GR4J conceptual rainfall-runoff model using a deep learning model to serve as a
surrogate for the routing component. DeepGR4J had an improved rainfall-runoff
prediction accuracy, particularly in arid catchments. Quantile regression
models have been extensively used for quantifying uncertainty while aiding
extreme value forecasting. In this paper, we extend DeepGR4J using a quantile
regression-based ensemble learning framework to quantify uncertainty in
streamflow prediction. We also leverage the uncertainty bounds to identify
extreme flow events potentially leading to flooding. We further extend the
model to multi-step streamflow predictions for uncertainty bounds. We design
experiments for a detailed evaluation of the proposed framework using the
CAMELS-Aus dataset. The results show that our proposed Quantile DeepGR4J
framework improves the predictive accuracy and uncertainty interval quality
(interval score) compared to baseline deep learning models. Furthermore, we
carry out flood risk evaluation using Quantile DeepGR4J, and the results
demonstrate its suitability as an early warning system.

TL;DR: 提出自适应混合位激活量化(AMAQ)方法，通过渐进式压缩激活和梯度来降低大语言模型分布式训练的通信开销，在相同比特预算下优于固定精度方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型规模快速扩展，给服务器-客户端分布式训练带来通信效率和计算开销的挑战，需要在低资源设备上实现高效的协作训练。

Method: 采用参数高效的分割学习，引入AMAQ策略，基于比特正则化按通道特征重要性和层级重要性分配比特预算，渐进式压缩激活和梯度从高精度(6-8位)到低精度(3-4位)。

Result: 在相同比特预算下，AMAQ相比固定精度方法在LLaMA3 8B和Qwen2.5 7B模型上获得约2.5%的生成准确率和1.3%的分类准确率提升，显著增强训练稳定性并减少超低位表示崩溃。

Conclusion: AMAQ能有效集成到实际多机协作训练中，以适度的通信开销提供优越的推理准确率，是通信成本最小化的实用协作训练解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are scaling rapidly, creating significant
challenges for collaborative server client distributed training, particularly
in terms of communication efficiency and computational overheads. To address
these challenges, we implement Parameter-efficient Split Learning, which
effectively balances efficiency and performance for collaborative training on
low-resource devices.
  To reduce communication overhead in collaborative training, we introduce
Adaptive Mixed bit Activation Quantization (AMAQ), a strategy that
progressively compresses activations and gradients from high precision (6 to 8
bits) to low precision (3 to 4 bits). AMAQ achieves this by effectively
allocating bit budgets across channels based on feature wise and layer wise
importance using bit regularization.
  Under the same bit budgets, AMAQ outperforms fixed-precision approaches,
delivering about 2.5% higher generation accuracy and about 1.3% better
classification accuracy for models like LLaMA3 8B and Qwen2.5 7B. In addition,
it significantly enhances training stability and reducing ultra-low bit
representation collapse during the training.
  Experiments demonstrate that AMAQ integrates effectively into practical
multi-machine collaborative training setups, offering superior inference
accuracy with only a modest communication overhead for bits adaptation during
training. This trade off makes AMAQ a practical and effective solution for
collaborative training with minimal communication cost.

Conclusion: ATOM代表了向准确、高效和可迁移分子动力学模型迈出的重要一步。

Abstract: Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations underpin modern computational drug dis-
covery, materials science, and biochemistry. Recent machine learning models
provide high-fidelity MD predictions without the need to repeatedly solve
quantum mechanical forces, enabling significant speedups over conventional
pipelines. Yet many such methods typically enforce strict equivariance and rely
on sequential rollouts, thus limiting their flexibility and simulation
efficiency. They are also com- monly single-task, trained on individual
molecules and fixed timeframes, which restricts generalization to unseen
compounds and extended timesteps. To address these issues, we propose Atomistic
Transformer Operator for Molecules (ATOM), a pretrained transformer neural
operator for multitask molecular dynamics. ATOM adopts a quasi-equivariant
design that requires no explicit molecular graph and employs a temporal
attention mechanism, allowing for the accurate parallel decod- ing of multiple
future states. To support operator pretraining across chemicals and timescales,
we curate TG80, a large, diverse, and numerically stable MD dataset with over
2.5 million femtoseconds of trajectories across 80 compounds. ATOM achieves
state-of-the-art performance on established single-task benchmarks, such as
MD17, RMD17 and MD22. After multitask pretraining on TG80, ATOM shows
exceptional zero-shot generalization to unseen molecules across varying time
hori- zons. We believe ATOM represents a significant step toward accurate,
efficient, and transferable molecular dynamics models

Abstract: Training - the optimisation of complex models - is traditionally performed
through small, local, iterative updates [D. E. Rumelhart, G. E. Hinton, R. J.
Williams, Nature 323, 533-536 (1986)]. Approximating solutions through
truncated gradients is a paradigm dating back to Cauchy [A.-L. Cauchy, Comptes
Rendus Math\'ematique 25, 536-538 (1847)] and Newton [I. Newton, The Method of
Fluxions and Infinite Series (Henry Woodfall, London, 1736)]. This work
introduces the Method of Infinite Descent, a semi-analytic optimisation
paradigm that reformulates training as the direct solution to the first-order
optimality condition. By analytical resummation of its Taylor expansion, this
method yields an exact, algebraic equation for the update step. Realisation of
the infinite Taylor tower's cascading resummation is formally derived, and an
exploitative algorithm for the direct solve step is proposed.
  This principle is demonstrated with the herein-introduced AION (Analytic,
Infinitely-Optimisable Network) architecture. AION is a model designed
expressly to satisfy the algebraic closure required by Infinite Descent. In a
simple test problem, AION reaches the optimum in a single descent step.
Together, this optimiser-model pair exemplify how analytic structure enables
exact, non-iterative convergence. Infinite Descent extends beyond this example,
applying to any appropriately closed architecture. This suggests a new class of
semi-analytically optimisable models: the \emph{Infinity Class}; sufficient
conditions for class membership are discussed. This offers a pathway toward
non-iterative learning.

Motivation: Muon优化器通过正交化参数更新改善了优化几何条件，但存在神经元更新不平衡问题。研究旨在结合正交化和自适应学习率的优势，开发更高效的优化器。

Method: 提出NorMuon优化器，维护每个神经元的二阶动量统计，在正交化后应用行级归一化，并在FSDP2框架下开发分布式实现。

Conclusion: 正交化和自适应学习率是互补而非竞争的方法，为大尺度深度学习中的优化器设计开辟了新途径。

Abstract: The choice of optimizer significantly impacts the training efficiency and
computational costs of large language models (LLMs). Recently, the Muon
optimizer has demonstrated promising results by orthogonalizing parameter
updates, improving optimization geometry through better conditioning. Despite
Muon's emergence as a candidate successor to Adam, the potential for jointly
leveraging their strengths has not been systematically explored. In this work,
we bridge this gap by proposing NorMuon (Neuron-wise Normalized Muon), an
optimizer that synergistically combines orthogonalization with neuron-level
adaptive learning rates. Our analysis reveals that while Muon effectively
reduces condition numbers, the resulting updates exhibit highly non-uniform
neuron norms, causing certain neurons to dominate the optimization process.
NorMuon addresses this imbalance by maintaining second-order momentum
statistics for each neuron and applying row-wise normalization after
orthogonalization, ensuring balanced parameter utilization while preserving
Muon's conditioning benefits. To enable practical deployment at scale, we
develop an efficient distributed implementation under the FSDP2 framework that
strategically distributes orthogonalization computations across devices.
Experiments across multiple model scales demonstrate that NorMuon consistently
outperforms both Adam and Muon, achieving 21.74% better training efficiency
than Adam and 11.31% improvement over Muon on 1.1 B pretraining setting, while
maintaining a comparable memory footprint to Muon. Our findings suggest that
orthogonalization and adaptive learning rates are complementary rather than
competing approaches, opening new avenues for optimizer design in large-scale
deep learning.

Conclusion: 采用时频结构正则化方案训练的ECG合成器可以作为个性化、高保真、隐私保护的替代品，在真实数据稀缺时推动生成式AI在医疗领域的负责任使用。

Abstract: The development of machine learning for cardiac care is severely hampered by
privacy restrictions on sharing real patient electrocardiogram (ECG) data.
Although generative AI offers a promising solution, the real-world use of
existing model-synthesized ECGs is limited by persistent gaps in
trustworthiness and clinical utility. In this work, we address two major
shortcomings of current generative ECG methods: insufficient morphological
fidelity and the inability to generate personalized, patient-specific
physiological signals. To address these gaps, we build on a conditional
diffusion-based Structured State Space Model (SSSD-ECG) with two principled
innovations: (1) MIDT-ECG (Mel-Spectrogram Informed Diffusion Training), a
novel training paradigm with time-frequency domain supervision to enforce
physiological structural realism, and (2) multi-modal demographic conditioning
to enable patient-specific synthesis. We comprehensively evaluate our approach
on the PTB-XL dataset, assessing the synthesized ECG signals on fidelity,
clinical coherence, privacy preservation, and downstream task utility. MIDT-ECG
achieves substantial gains: it improves morphological coherence, preserves
strong privacy guarantees with all metrics evaluated exceeding the baseline by
4-8%, and notably reduces the interlead correlation error by an average of 74%,
while demographic conditioning enhances signal-to-noise ratio and
personalization. In critical low-data regimes, a classifier trained on datasets
supplemented with our synthetic ECGs achieves performance comparable to a
classifier trained solely on real data. Together, we demonstrate that ECG
synthesizers, trained with the proposed time-frequency structural
regularization scheme, can serve as personalized, high-fidelity,
privacy-preserving surrogates when real data are scarce, advancing the
responsible use of generative AI in healthcare.

TL;DR: 该论文分析了等变图神经网络(EGNNs)在晶体结构预测中的计算和表达能力限制，证明在多项式精度、O(n)嵌入宽度、O(1)层数等约束下，EGNNs可被统一TC^0阈值电路族模拟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管等变图神经网络在材料科学中表现出色，但其在周期性、对称性约束设置下的表达能力仍未被充分理解。

Method: 通过电路复杂度视角分析EGNN层在节点特征、原子坐标和晶格矩阵上的计算，证明其在特定资源约束下可被TC^0电路模拟。

Result: 证明了EGNNs在多项式精度、O(n)嵌入宽度、O(1)层数等条件下可被统一TC^0阈值电路族模拟，并给出了明确的常数深度界限。

Conclusion: 将EGNNs定位在TC^0复杂度类中，为对称感知的晶体系统图学习提供了复杂性理论基础，并指明了超越该计算体制所需的架构改进方向。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have become a core paradigm for learning on
relational data. In materials science, equivariant GNNs (EGNNs) have emerged as
a compelling backbone for crystalline-structure prediction, owing to their
ability to respect Euclidean symmetries and periodic boundary conditions.
Despite strong empirical performance, their expressive power in periodic,
symmetry-constrained settings remains poorly understood. This work
characterizes the intrinsic computational and expressive limits of EGNNs for
crystalline-structure prediction through a circuit-complexity lens. We analyze
the computations carried out by EGNN layers acting on node features, atomic
coordinates, and lattice matrices, and prove that, under polynomial precision,
embedding width $d=O(n)$ for $n$ nodes, $O(1)$ layers, and $O(1)$-depth,
$O(n)$-width MLP instantiations of the message/update/readout maps, these
models admit a simulation by a uniform $\mathsf{TC}^0$ threshold-circuit family
of polynomial size (with an explicit constant-depth bound). Situating EGNNs
within $\mathsf{TC}^0$ provides a concrete ceiling on the decision and
prediction problems solvable by such architectures under realistic resource
constraints and clarifies which architectural modifications (e.g., increased
depth, richer geometric primitives, or wider layers) are required to transcend
this regime. The analysis complements Weisfeiler-Lehman style results that do
not directly transfer to periodic crystals, and offers a complexity-theoretic
foundation for symmetry-aware graph learning on crystalline systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究开发了一种基于脑电图(EEG)的疼痛评估系统，使用机器学习模型对高疼痛与低/无疼痛状态进行分类，在健康成人激光诱发疼痛实验中达到88.9%的准确率，证明了EEG疼痛监测在临床环境中的技术可行性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前医院疼痛评估主要依赖患者自述或非特异性心电图生命体征，这使危重、镇静和认知障碍患者面临疼痛治疗不足和过度使用阿片类药物的风险。EEG提供了一种无创测量大脑活动的方法，可作为辅助工具检测伤害性处理过程。

Method: 使用52名健康成人的EEG数据，暴露于三种强度(低、中、高)的激光诱发疼痛。将每个4秒时段转换为包含537个特征的向量，涵盖频谱功率、频带比率、Hjorth参数、熵测量、相干性、小波能量和峰值频率指标。评估了9种传统机器学习模型，采用留一参与者交叉验证。

Result: 支持向量机(RBF核)获得最佳离线性能，准确率达88.9%，推理时间小于1毫秒(1.02ms)。特征重要性分析与经典疼痛生理学一致，显示对侧α抑制、中线θ/α增强和额叶γ爆发。实时XGBoost模型保持约4毫秒的端到端延迟和94.2%的准确率。

Conclusion: 基于EEG的疼痛监测在临床环境中技术上可行，为临床验证提供了途径，有望改善危重和认知障碍患者的疼痛管理。

Abstract: Current pain assessment within hospitals often relies on self-reporting or
non-specific EKG vital signs. This system leaves critically ill, sedated, and
cognitively impaired patients vulnerable to undertreated pain and opioid
overuse. Electroencephalography (EEG) offers a noninvasive method of measuring
brain activity. This technology could potentially be applied as an assistive
tool to highlight nociceptive processing in order to mitigate this issue. In
this study, we compared machine learning models for classifying high-pain
versus low/no-pain EEG epochs using data from fifty-two healthy adults exposed
to laser-evoked pain at three intensities (low, medium, high). Each four-second
epoch was transformed into a 537-feature vector spanning spectral power, band
ratios, Hjorth parameters, entropy measures, coherence, wavelet energies, and
peak-frequency metrics. Nine traditional machine learning models were evaluated
with leave-one-participant-out cross-validation. A support vector machine with
radial basis function kernel achieved the best offline performance with 88.9%
accuracy and sub-millisecond inference time (1.02 ms). Our Feature importance
analysis was consistent with current canonical pain physiology, showing
contralateral alpha suppression, midline theta/alpha enhancement, and frontal
gamma bursts. The real-time XGBoost model maintained an end-to-end latency of
about 4 ms and 94.2% accuracy, demonstrating that an EEG-based pain monitor is
technically feasible within a clinical setting and provides a pathway towards
clinical validation.

*Wei-Ting Tang,Akshay Kudva,Joel A. Paulson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NeST-BO是一种针对高维贝叶斯优化的局部方法，通过联合学习梯度和Hessian信息来逼近牛顿步，并利用前瞻误差界选择评估点，在保持收敛性的同时将计算成本从O(d²)降低到O(m²)。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 贝叶斯优化在处理昂贵黑盒问题时有效，但在高维空间中面临挑战。现有方法难以有效利用二阶信息，且计算成本随维度平方增长。

Method: 提出NeST-BO方法：使用高斯过程代理模型联合学习梯度和Hessian信息，通过一步前瞻牛顿步误差界选择评估点，并在低维子空间中优化采集函数以降低计算成本。

Result: 在高维合成和真实世界问题（包括数千变量和未知活跃子空间的情况）中，NeST-BO相比现有局部和高维BO基线方法，实现了更快的收敛速度和更低的遗憾值。

Conclusion: NeST-BO通过有效利用二阶信息并降低计算复杂度，在高维贝叶斯优化中表现出色，继承了不精确牛顿法的收敛性质，具有全局进展和局部二次收敛率。

Abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) is effective for expensive black-box problems but
remains challenging in high dimensions. We propose NeST-BO, a local BO method
that targets the Newton step by jointly learning gradient and Hessian
information with Gaussian process surrogates, and selecting evaluations via a
one-step lookahead bound on Newton-step error. We show that this bound (and
hence the step error) contracts with batch size, so NeST-BO directly inherits
inexact-Newton convergence: global progress under mild stability assumptions
and quadratic local rates once steps are sufficiently accurate. To scale, we
optimize the acquisition in low-dimensional subspaces (e.g., random embeddings
or learned sparse subspaces), reducing the dominant cost of learning curvature
from $O(d^2)$ to $O(m^2)$ with $m \ll d$ while preserving step targeting.
Across high-dimensional synthetic and real-world problems, including cases with
thousands of variables and unknown active subspaces, NeST-BO consistently
yields faster convergence and lower regret than state-of-the-art local and
high-dimensional BO baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLHF和DPO方法面临偏好数据污染、奖励过优化和模型偏好冗长三个严重问题，现有工作大多只解决其中一个问题，且缺乏理论保证。

Method: 提出RLHF-COV和DPO-COV算法，通过长度正则化处理冗长偏好，在污染数据上训练，无需估计多个奖励模型。

Result: 理论证明DPO-COV在污染数据上的泛化误差率与干净数据情况下的最优已知率匹配，实验验证了算法在离线和在线设置下的有效性。

Conclusion: RLHF-COV和DPO-COV能同时解决三个关键问题，理论保证强，实现简单，且证明了RLHF与DPO的等价性。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and direct preference
optimization (DPO) are important techniques to align large language models
(LLM) with human preference. However, the quality of RLHF and DPO training is
seriously compromised by \textit{\textbf{C}orrupted} preference, reward
\textit{\textbf{O}veroptimization}, and bias towards
\textit{\textbf{V}erbosity}. To our knowledge, most existing works tackle only
one of these important issues, and the few other works require much computation
to estimate multiple reward models and lack theoretical guarantee of
generalization ability. In this work, we propose RLHF-\textbf{COV} and
DPO-\textbf{COV} algorithms that can simultaneously mitigate these three
issues, in both offline and online settings. This ability is theoretically
demonstrated by obtaining length-regularized generalization error rates for our
DPO-COV algorithms trained on corrupted data, which match the best-known rates
for simpler cases with clean data and without length regularization. Moreover,
our DPO-COV algorithm is simple to implement without reward estimation, and is
proved to be equivalent to our RLHF-COV algorithm, which directly implies the
equivalence between the vanilla RLHF and DPO algorithms. Experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of our DPO-COV algorithms under both offline and
online settings.

Motivation: 图模型估计通常需要大规模图数据，但实践中往往只能获得小规模网络。迁移学习框架可以通过利用相关源图的结构信息来改善小目标图的估计精度。

Method: GTRANS结合邻域平滑和Gromov-Wasserstein最优传输来对齐和传输图间结构模式，包含自适应去偏机制通过残差平滑识别和校正目标特定偏差。

Result: 理论证明了对齐矩阵估计的稳定性，通过大量合成和真实数据实验验证了GTRANS在提高目标图估计精度方面的有效性。

Conclusion: GTRANS显著改善了图估计精度，直接提升了图分类和链接预测等下游任务的性能。

Abstract: Graphon models provide a flexible nonparametric framework for estimating
latent connectivity probabilities in networks, enabling a range of downstream
applications such as link prediction and data augmentation. However, accurate
graphon estimation typically requires a large graph, whereas in practice, one
often only observes a small-sized network. One approach to addressing this
issue is to adopt a transfer learning framework, which aims to improve
estimation in a small target graph by leveraging structural information from a
larger, related source graph. In this paper, we propose a novel method, namely
GTRANS, a transfer learning framework that integrates neighborhood smoothing
and Gromov-Wasserstein optimal transport to align and transfer structural
patterns between graphs. To prevent negative transfer, GTRANS includes an
adaptive debiasing mechanism that identifies and corrects for target-specific
deviations via residual smoothing. We provide theoretical guarantees on the
stability of the estimated alignment matrix and demonstrate the effectiveness
of GTRANS in improving the accuracy of target graph estimation through
extensive synthetic and real data experiments. These improvements translate
directly to enhanced performance in downstream applications, such as the graph
classification task and the link prediction task.

TL;DR: ARMOR是一种新颖的一次性后训练剪枝算法，通过矩阵分解将权重矩阵分解为2:4稀疏核心和两个低开销的块对角矩阵，在保持2:4剪枝推理加速和内存减少的同时，显著提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型部署时计算和内存需求巨大的挑战，同时克服现有2:4稀疏剪枝方法导致的显著性能下降问题。

Method: 采用矩阵分解方法，将每个权重矩阵分解为2:4稀疏核心和两个块对角矩阵包装器，通过块坐标下降算法最小化层间代理损失来选择稀疏核心和块对角包装器。

Result: 在Llama和Qwen模型系列上的实验表明，ARMOR在各种下游任务和困惑度评估中持续显著优于最先进的2:4剪枝方法。

Conclusion: ARMOR在模型压缩和任务准确性之间建立了更有效的权衡，同时保持了2:4剪枝的推理加速和内存使用减少优势。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) present significant deployment challenges due to
their immense computational and memory requirements. While semi-structured
pruning, particularly 2:4 sparsity, offers a path to practical hardware
acceleration, existing methods often incur substantial performance degradation.
To bridge this gap, we introduce ARMOR: (Adaptive Representation with
Matrix-factORization), a novel one-shot post-training pruning algorithm.
Instead of directly pruning weights, ARMOR factorizes each weight matrix into a
2:4 sparse core wrapped by two low-overhead, block diagonal matrices. These
wrappers act as efficient pre and post-transformation error correctors,
offering greater flexibility to preserve model quality compared to conventional
2:4 pruning techniques. The sparse core and block diagonal wrappers are chosen
through a block coordinate descent algorithm that minimizes a layer-wise proxy
loss. We theoretically prove this optimization is guaranteed to converge to a
solution with a proxy loss less than or equal to state-of-the-art pruning
algorithms. Experiments on Llama (Touvron et al., 2023; Dubey et al., 2024) and
Qwen (Yang et al., 2025) model families demonstrate that ARMOR consistently and
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art 2:4 pruning methods across a wide
range of downstream tasks and perplexity evaluations. ARMOR achieves this
superior performance while retaining the inference speedups and substantial
memory usage reductions of 2:4 pruning, establishing a more effective trade-off
between model compression and task accuracy

### [154] [LATTA: Langevin-Anchored Test-Time Adaptation for Enhanced Robustness and Stability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05530)
*Harshil Vejendla*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LATTA是一种新的测试时自适应方法，通过噪声权重扰动和稳定权重锚机制，在保持稳定性的同时有效适应分布偏移，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时自适应方法（如Tent）存在不稳定性和灾难性遗忘问题，特别是在小批量或挑战性数据损坏情况下，这源于在复杂损失表面上过于确定性的更新。

Method: 提出Langevin锚定测试时自适应（LATTA），结合两种机制：(1)受随机梯度Langevin动力学启发的噪声权重扰动，探索局部参数空间并逃离不良局部最小值；(2)稳定权重锚，防止模型偏离其鲁棒源预训练。

Result: 在Rotated-MNIST和CIFAR-10-C等标准基准测试中，LATTA显著优于Tent、CoTTA和EATA等现有方法，在CIFAR-10-C上将平均准确率提高了2%以上，同时降低了性能方差。

Conclusion: LATTA为自监督测试时自适应设定了新的技术标准，能够有效适应分布偏移而不会牺牲稳定性，且无需架构更改或昂贵的蒙特卡洛计算。

Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) aims to adapt a pretrained model to distribution
shifts using only unlabeled test data. While promising, existing methods like
Tent suffer from instability and can catastrophically forget the source
knowledge, especially with small batch sizes or challenging corruptions. We
argue that this arises from overly deterministic updates on a complex loss
surface. In this paper, we introduce Langevin-Anchored Test-Time Adaptation
(LATTA), a novel approach that regularizes adaptation through two key
mechanisms: (1) a noisy weight perturbation inspired by Stochastic Gradient
Langevin Dynamics (SGLD) to explore the local parameter space and escape poor
local minima, and (2) a stable weight anchor that prevents the model from
diverging from its robust source pre-training. This combination allows LATTA to
adapt effectively without sacrificing stability. Unlike prior Bayesian TTA
methods, LATTA requires no architectural changes or expensive Monte Carlo
passes. We conduct extensive experiments on standard benchmarks, including
Rotated-MNIST and the more challenging CIFAR-10-C. Our results demonstrate that
LATTA significantly outperforms existing methods, including Tent, CoTTA, and
EATA, setting a new state of the art for self-supervised TTA by improving
average accuracy on CIFAR-10-C by over 2% while simultaneously reducing
performance variance.

Motivation: 现有特征选择方法难以捕捉复杂特征交互且无法适应分布式场景，特别是在数据不平衡、异构和隐私约束的实际环境中。

Method: 集成置换不变嵌入与策略引导搜索，开发隐私保护知识融合策略和样本感知权重策略来处理异构客户端数据。

Result: 大量实验验证了框架的有效性、鲁棒性和效率，在联邦学习场景中展现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该框架成功解决了分布式特征选择中的隐私保护和数据不平衡问题，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Feature selection eliminates redundancy among features to improve downstream
task performance while reducing computational overhead. Existing methods often
struggle to capture intricate feature interactions and adapt across diverse
application scenarios. Recent advances employ generative intelligence to
alleviate these drawbacks. However, these methods remain constrained by
permutation sensitivity in embedding and reliance on convexity assumptions in
gradient-based search. To address these limitations, our initial work
introduces a novel framework that integrates permutation-invariant embedding
with policy-guided search. Although effective, it still left opportunities to
adapt to realistic distributed scenarios. In practice, data across local
clients is highly imbalanced, heterogeneous and constrained by strict privacy
regulations, limiting direct sharing. These challenges highlight the need for a
framework that can integrate feature selection knowledge across clients without
exposing sensitive information. In this extended journal version, we advance
the framework from two perspectives: 1) developing a privacy-preserving
knowledge fusion strategy to derive a unified representation space without
sharing sensitive raw data. 2) incorporating a sample-aware weighting strategy
to address distributional imbalance among heterogeneous local clients.
Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness, robustness, and efficiency of
our framework. The results further demonstrate its strong generalization
ability in federated learning scenarios. The code and data are publicly

TL;DR: 论文分析了注意力机制在长上下文中的病理现象——注意力分数随上下文长度增加而趋于均匀化（rank-collapse），并通过理论分析证明了注意力缩放中β_n ∝ log n的关键作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型处理更长上下文，注意力层出现注意力分数均匀化的问题，导致token过度聚集。虽然注意力缩放通过多项式对数因子β_n重新缩放注意力分数来应对这一问题，但缺乏理论依据。

Method: 使用简化的可处理模型来放大注意力缩放的效果，分析注意力在不同缩放因子β_n下的相变行为。

Result: 发现注意力存在相变：缩放不足时所有token坍缩到单一方向，缩放过度时注意力退化为恒等变换。确定了临界缩放β_n ∝ log n。

Conclusion: 为YaRN和Qwen中的注意力缩放提供了严格的理论依据，阐明了对数缩放能在长上下文中保持稀疏、内容自适应的注意力机制。

Abstract: As large language models scale to longer contexts, attention layers suffer
from a fundamental pathology: attention scores collapse toward uniformity as
context length $n$ increases, causing tokens to cluster excessively, a
phenomenon known as rank-collapse. While $\textit{attention scaling}$
effectively addresses this deficiency by rescaling attention scores with a
polylogarithmic factor $\beta_n$, theoretical justification for this approach
remains lacking.
  We analyze a simplified yet tractable model that magnifies the effect of
attention scaling. In this model, attention exhibits a phase transition
governed by the scaling factor $\beta_n$: insufficient scaling collapses all
tokens to a single direction, while excessive scaling reduces attention to
identity, thereby eliminating meaningful interactions between tokens. Our main
result identifies the critical scaling $\beta_n \asymp \log n$ and provides a
rigorous justification for attention scaling in YaRN and Qwen, clarifying why
logarithmic scaling maintains sparse, content-adaptive attention at large
context lengths.

Abstract: Spoofing detection in financial trading is crucial, especially for
identifying complex behaviors such as conspiracy spoofing. Traditional
machine-learning approaches primarily focus on isolated node features, often
overlooking the broader context of interconnected nodes. Graph-based
techniques, particularly Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), have advanced the field
by leveraging relational information effectively. However, in real-world
spoofing detection datasets, trading behaviors exhibit dynamic, irregular
patterns. Existing spoofing detection methods, though effective in some
scenarios, struggle to capture the complexity of dynamic and diverse, evolving
inter-node relationships. To address these challenges, we propose a novel
framework called the Generative Dynamic Graph Model (GDGM), which models
dynamic trading behaviors and the relationships among nodes to learn
representations for conspiracy spoofing detection. Specifically, our approach
incorporates the generative dynamic latent space to capture the temporal
patterns and evolving market conditions. Raw trading data is first converted
into time-stamped sequences. Then we model trading behaviors using the neural
ordinary differential equations and gated recurrent units, to generate the
representation incorporating temporal dynamics of spoofing patterns.
Furthermore, pseudo-label generation and heterogeneous aggregation techniques
are employed to gather relevant information and enhance the detection
performance for conspiratorial spoofing behaviors. Experiments conducted on
spoofing detection datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms
state-of-the-art models in detection accuracy. Additionally, our spoofing
detection system has been successfully deployed in one of the largest global
trading markets, further validating the practical applicability and performance
of the proposed method.

Conclusion: TGAE方法能够有效模拟时序图的结构和时序特性，在质量和效率方面都表现出色，为时序图生成提供了高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Graph simulation has recently received a surge of attention in graph
processing and analytics. In real-life applications, e.g. social science,
biology, and chemistry, many graphs are composed of a series of evolving graphs
(i.e., temporal graphs). While most of the existing graph generators focus on
static graphs, the temporal information of the graphs is ignored. In this
paper, we focus on simulating temporal graphs, which aim to reproduce the
structural and temporal properties of the observed real-life temporal graphs.
In this paper, we first give an overview of the existing temporal graph
generators, including recently emerged learning-based approaches. Most of these
learning-based methods suffer from one of the limitations: low efficiency in
training or slow generating, especially for temporal random walk-based methods.
Therefore, we propose an efficient learning-based approach to generate graph
snapshots, namely temporal graph autoencoder (TGAE). Specifically, we propose
an attention-based graph encoder to encode temporal and structural
characteristics on sampled ego-graphs. And we proposed an ego-graph decoder
that can achieve a good trade-off between simulation quality and efficiency in
temporal graph generation. Finally, the experimental evaluation is conducted
among our proposed TGAE and representative temporal graph generators on
real-life temporal graphs and synthesized graphs. It is reported that our
proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art temporal graph generators by
means of simulation quality and efficiency.

Motivation: 传统协作学习方法基于模型权重共享，而基于嵌入共享的方法在资源效率方面有优势，但目前缺乏针对嵌入共享的差分隐私机制。

Method: 联合学习隐私编码网络和小型效用生成网络，生成具有差分隐私保证的嵌入，然后由服务器进行后处理以提高机器学习任务的准确性。

Result: 该方法只需一轮私有化通信，客户端计算量少于传统方法，且私有化嵌入与服务器模型类型无关（深度学习、随机森林或XGBoost均可使用）。

Conclusion: 通过协作学习和隐私学习的协同设计，实现了高效、隐私保护的嵌入共享方案，适用于多种服务器模型类型。

Abstract: Traditional collaborative learning approaches are based on sharing of model
weights between clients and a server. However, there are advantages to resource
efficiency through schemes based on sharing of embeddings (activations) created
from the data. Several differentially private methods were developed for
sharing of weights while such mechanisms do not exist so far for sharing of
embeddings. We propose Ours to learn a privacy encoding network in conjunction
with a small utility generation network such that the final embeddings
generated from it are equipped with formal differential privacy guarantees.
These privatized embeddings are then shared with a more powerful server, that
learns a post-processing that results in a higher accuracy for machine learning
tasks. We show that our co-design of collaborative and private learning results
in requiring only one round of privatized communication and lesser compute on
the client than traditional methods. The privatized embeddings that we share
from the client are agnostic to the type of model (deep learning, random
forests or XGBoost) used on the server in order to process these activations to

Main category: cs.LG

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型训练数据几乎涵盖所有可用数据，加剧了隐私泄露风险，迫切需要量化LLM发布前的隐私风险。

Method: 提出InfoRMIA信息论成员推理攻击方法，并引入token级信号分析来定位记忆泄露。

Result: InfoRMIA在基准测试中始终优于RMIA，计算效率更高，token级分析能精确定位记忆的token并增强序列级推理能力。

Conclusion: 重新思考LLM中的隐私问题，token级分析可带来更有针对性的缓解措施，如精确遗忘。

Abstract: Machine learning models are known to leak sensitive information, as they
inevitably memorize (parts of) their training data. More alarmingly, large
language models (LLMs) are now trained on nearly all available data, which
amplifies the magnitude of information leakage and raises serious privacy
risks. Hence, it is more crucial than ever to quantify privacy risk before the
release of LLMs. The standard method to quantify privacy is via membership
inference attacks, where the state-of-the-art approach is the Robust Membership
Inference Attack (RMIA). In this paper, we present InfoRMIA, a principled
information-theoretic formulation of membership inference. Our method
consistently outperforms RMIA across benchmarks while also offering improved
computational efficiency.
  In the second part of the paper, we identify the limitations of treating
sequence-level membership inference as the gold standard for measuring leakage.
We propose a new perspective for studying membership and memorization in LLMs:
token-level signals and analyses. We show that a simple token-based InfoRMIA
can pinpoint which tokens are memorized within generated outputs, thereby
localizing leakage from the sequence level down to individual tokens, while
achieving stronger sequence-level inference power on LLMs. This new scope
rethinks privacy in LLMs and can lead to more targeted mitigation, such as
exact unlearning.

*Arindam Chowdhury,Massimiliano Lupo Pasini*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个统一的基准测试框架，用于系统评估图神经网络中消息传递和全局注意力机制在不同原子图学习任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前图神经网络在原子尺度建模中，消息传递神经网络和全局注意力机制的结合使用日益普遍，但由于实现、特征和超参数调优的不一致，尚不清楚全局注意力机制何时真正优于经过良好调优的消息传递层。

Method: 开发了基于HydraGNN的统一可复现基准测试框架，支持在四种受控模型类之间无缝切换：纯MPNN、带化学/拓扑编码器的MPNN、MPNN与全局注意力的GPS风格混合模型，以及带编码器的完全融合局部-全局模型。使用七个不同的开源数据集进行回归和分类任务基准测试。

Result: 研究表明，编码器增强的MPNN构成了稳健的基线，而融合局部-全局模型在由长程相互作用效应控制的属性上产生了最明显的优势。同时量化了注意力的精度-计算权衡，报告了其内存开销。

Conclusion: 这项研究建立了原子图学习中全局注意力的首次受控评估，并为未来模型开发提供了一个可复现的测试平台。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are widely used as surrogates for costly
experiments and first-principles simulations to study the behavior of compounds
at atomistic scale, and their architectural complexity is constantly increasing
to enable the modeling of complex physics. While most recent GNNs combine more
traditional message passing neural networks (MPNNs) layers to model short-range
interactions with more advanced graph transformers (GTs) with global attention
mechanisms to model long-range interactions, it is still unclear when global
attention mechanisms provide real benefits over well-tuned MPNN layers due to
inconsistent implementations, features, or hyperparameter tuning. We introduce
the first unified, reproducible benchmarking framework - built on HydraGNN -
that enables seamless switching among four controlled model classes: MPNN, MPNN
with chemistry/topology encoders, GPS-style hybrids of MPNN with global
attention, and fully fused local - global models with encoders. Using seven
diverse open-source datasets for benchmarking across regression and
classification tasks, we systematically isolate the contributions of message
passing, global attention, and encoder-based feature augmentation. Our study
shows that encoder-augmented MPNNs form a robust baseline, while fused
local-global models yield the clearest benefits for properties governed by
long-range interaction effects. We further quantify the accuracy - compute
trade-offs of attention, reporting its overhead in memory. Together, these
results establish the first controlled evaluation of global attention in
atomistic graph learning and provide a reproducible testbed for future model
development.

Result: 在真实世界数据集上的广泛实验表明，TimePD平均优于最先进基线方法9.3%

Conclusion: TimePD是首个成功解决无源时间序列预测问题的框架，通过LLM泛化能力和代理去噪机制实现了有效的跨域适配

Abstract: The proliferation of mobile devices generates a massive volume of time series
across various domains, where effective time series forecasting enables a
variety of real-world applications. This study focuses on a new problem of
source-free domain adaptation for time series forecasting. It aims to adapt a
pretrained model from sufficient source time series to the sparse target time
series domain without access to the source data, embracing data protection
regulations. To achieve this, we propose TimePD, the first source-free time
series forecasting framework with proxy denoising, where large language models
(LLMs) are employed to benefit from their generalization capabilities.
Specifically, TimePD consists of three key components: (1) dual-branch
invariant disentangled feature learning that enforces representation- and
gradient-wise invariance by means of season-trend decomposition; (2)
lightweight, parameter-free proxy denoising that dynamically calibrates
systematic biases of LLMs; and (3) knowledge distillation that bidirectionally
aligns the denoised prediction and the original target prediction. Extensive
experiments on real-world datasets offer insight into the effectiveness of the
proposed TimePD, outperforming SOTA baselines by 9.3% on average.

*Andrew Ly,Pulin Gong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 深度学习存在可预测性的基本限制，源于其吸引盆的复杂分形几何结构，导致即使初始条件微小变化也可能产生完全不同结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解深度学习的可预测性极限，揭示其训练结果不可复现的根本原因，这对AI的安全部署具有重要意义。

Method: 通过分析深度学习中的混沌学习动态和对称性诱导的不变子空间，推导出产生复杂吸引盆的充分条件，并计算不确定性指数。

Result: 发现深度学习吸引盆具有无限精细的分形结构，不确定性指数接近零，初始条件精度的提高只能带来边际的可预测性增益。

Conclusion: 复杂吸引盆结构对神经网络训练的可预测性和可复现性施加了基本限制，为深度学习提供了统一的理论解释，对优化和AI安全部署有重要影响。

Abstract: Fundamental limits to predictability are central to our understanding of many
physical and computational systems. Here we show that, despite its remarkable
capabilities, deep learning exhibits such fundamental limits rooted in the
fractal, riddled geometry of its basins of attraction: any initialization that
leads to one solution lies arbitrarily close to another that leads to a
different one. We derive sufficient conditions for the emergence of riddled
basins by analytically linking features widely observed in deep learning,
including chaotic learning dynamics and symmetry-induced invariant subspaces,
to reveal a general route to riddling in realistic deep networks. The resulting
basins of attraction possess an infinitely fine-scale fractal structure
characterized by an uncertainty exponent near zero, so that even large
increases in the precision of initial conditions yield only marginal gains in
outcome predictability. Riddling thus imposes a fundamental limit on the
predictability and hence reproducibility of neural network training, providing
a unified account of many empirical observations. These results reveal a
general organizing principle of deep learning with important implications for
optimization and the safe deployment of artificial intelligence.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MCNO提出了一种基于蒙特卡洛方法的神经算子框架，用于学习一维偏微分方程的解算子，无需依赖谱表示或平移不变性假设，能够跨网格分辨率泛化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如傅里叶神经算子(FNO)依赖谱表示和平移不变性假设，限制了其适用性。MCNO旨在提供一种更灵活、理论上支持的替代方案。

Method: 将核函数表示为可学习张量，使用蒙特卡洛方法近似积分算子，通过一次均匀采样和插值步骤实现任意输入输出网格间的映射。

Result: 在标准1D PDE基准测试中达到竞争性精度，计算效率高。理论分析证明蒙特卡洛估计器在温和正则性假设下具有有界偏差和方差。

Conclusion: MCNO为连续域PDE的神经算子框架提供了一种基于蒙特卡洛积分的新方法，可自然扩展到高维问题，是谱方法和图基蒙特卡洛方法的有力替代方案。

Abstract: The Monte Carlo-type Neural Operator (MCNO) introduces a framework for
learning solution operators of one-dimensional partial differential equations
(PDEs) by directly learning the kernel function and approximating the
associated integral operator using a Monte Carlo-type approach. Unlike Fourier
Neural Operators (FNOs), which rely on spectral representations and assume
translation-invariant kernels, MCNO makes no such assumptions. The kernel is
represented as a learnable tensor over sampled input-output pairs, and sampling
is performed once, uniformly at random from a discretized grid. This design
enables generalization across multiple grid resolutions without relying on
fixed global basis functions or repeated sampling during training, while an
interpolation step maps between arbitrary input and output grids to further
enhance flexibility. Experiments on standard 1D PDE benchmarks show that MCNO
achieves competitive accuracy with efficient computational cost. We also
provide a theoretical analysis proving that the Monte Carlo estimator yields a
bounded bias and variance under mild regularity assumptions. This result holds
in any spatial dimension, suggesting that MCNO may extend naturally beyond
one-dimensional problems. More broadly, this work explores how Monte Carlo-type
integration can be incorporated into neural operator frameworks for
continuous-domain PDEs, providing a theoretically supported alternative to
spectral methods (such as FNO) and to graph-based Monte Carlo approaches (such
as the Graph Kernel Neural Operator, GNO).

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NEO是一种超参数免费、计算成本低的测试时自适应方法，通过重新居中目标数据嵌入到原点来改善源域和分布偏移样本的对齐，在多个数据集上实现了优异的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的测试时自适应方法通常计算昂贵、需要大量数据进行有效适应，或者对超参数敏感。基于潜在空间几何的理论基础，通过重新居中目标数据嵌入可以显著改善源域和分布偏移样本的对齐。

Method: 提出NEO方法，基于潜在空间几何理论，将目标数据嵌入重新居中到原点，无需额外超参数，计算成本与普通推理相当。

Result: 在ImageNet-C上，仅使用64个样本的一个批次就能将ViT-Base的准确率从55.6%提升到59.2%；在512个样本上，在ImageNet-C、ImageNet-R和ImageNet-S上优于7种TTA方法中的全部，在CIFAR-10-C上优于6/7；在Raspberry Pi和Jetson Orin Nano设备上，推理时间减少63%，内存使用减少9%。

Conclusion: NEO是一种高效有效的测试时自适应方法，在3种ViT架构和4个数据集上表现出色，计算成本低且无需超参数调优。

Abstract: Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) methods are often computationally expensive,
require a large amount of data for effective adaptation, or are brittle to
hyperparameters. Based on a theoretical foundation of the geometry of the
latent space, we are able to significantly improve the alignment between source
and distribution-shifted samples by re-centering target data embeddings at the
origin. This insight motivates NEO -- a hyperparameter-free fully TTA method,
that adds no significant compute compared to vanilla inference. NEO is able to
improve the classification accuracy of ViT-Base on ImageNet-C from 55.6% to
59.2% after adapting on just one batch of 64 samples. When adapting on 512
samples NEO beats all 7 TTA methods we compare against on ImageNet-C,
ImageNet-R and ImageNet-S and beats 6/7 on CIFAR-10-C, while using the least
amount of compute. NEO performs well on model calibration metrics and
additionally is able to adapt from 1 class to improve accuracy on 999 other
classes in ImageNet-C. On Raspberry Pi and Jetson Orin Nano devices, NEO
reduces inference time by 63% and memory usage by 9% compared to baselines. Our
results based on 3 ViT architectures and 4 datasets show that NEO can be used
efficiently and effectively for TTA.

### [166] [Quantifying the Accuracy-Interpretability Trade-Off in Concept-Based Sidechannel Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05670)
*David Debot,Giuseppe Marra*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Sidechannel Independence Score (SIS)和SIS正则化方法，用于在概念侧信道模型中平衡准确性和可解释性之间的权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 概念瓶颈模型(CBNMs)通过概念瓶颈层提供可解释性，但限制了信息流导致准确性下降；概念侧信道模型(CSMs)通过侧信道提高准确性，但损害了可解释性。目前缺乏控制这种权衡的原则性方法。

Method: 提出了统一的概率概念侧信道元模型，引入侧信道独立性评分(SIS)来量化模型对侧信道的依赖程度，并提出SIS正则化来显式惩罚侧信道依赖以改善可解释性。

Result: 实验结果表明，仅以准确性为目标训练的最先进CSMs表现出较低的表征可解释性，而SIS正则化显著提高了它们的可解释性、可干预性和学习到的可解释任务预测器质量。

Conclusion: 该工作为开发在准确性和可解释性之间实现原则性平衡的CSMs提供了理论和实践工具。

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBNMs) are deep learning models that provide
interpretability by enforcing a bottleneck layer where predictions are based
exclusively on human-understandable concepts. However, this constraint also
restricts information flow and often results in reduced predictive accuracy.
Concept Sidechannel Models (CSMs) address this limitation by introducing a
sidechannel that bypasses the bottleneck and carry additional task-relevant
information. While this improves accuracy, it simultaneously compromises
interpretability, as predictions may rely on uninterpretable representations
transmitted through sidechannels. Currently, there exists no principled
technique to control this fundamental trade-off. In this paper, we close this
gap. First, we present a unified probabilistic concept sidechannel meta-model
that subsumes existing CSMs as special cases. Building on this framework, we
introduce the Sidechannel Independence Score (SIS), a metric that quantifies a
CSM's reliance on its sidechannel by contrasting predictions made with and
without sidechannel information. We propose SIS regularization, which
explicitly penalizes sidechannel reliance to improve interpretability. Finally,
we analyze how the expressivity of the predictor and the reliance of the
sidechannel jointly shape interpretability, revealing inherent trade-offs
across different CSM architectures. Empirical results show that
state-of-the-art CSMs, when trained solely for accuracy, exhibit low
representation interpretability, and that SIS regularization substantially
improves their interpretability, intervenability, and the quality of learned
interpretable task predictors. Our work provides both theoretical and practical
tools for developing CSMs that balance accuracy and interpretability in a
principled manner.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 保险欺诈检测中，图方法因类别不平衡和图的异质动态特性而难以找到有意义的表示，而基于表格数据的梯度提升树方法仍占主导地位。

Method: 开发了归纳图梯度提升机(G-GBM)，结合图结构和梯度提升森林，适用于异质动态图的监督学习。

Result: 在模拟随机图实验中与流行的图神经网络方法竞争，在开源和专有保险欺诈数据集上表现出强大检测能力。

Conclusion: G-GBM不仅性能优异，还能通过现有的可解释性方法提供预测洞察，为保险欺诈检测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Graph-based methods are becoming increasingly popular in machine learning due
to their ability to model complex data and relations. Insurance fraud is a
prime use case, since false claims are often the result of organised criminals
that stage accidents or the same persons filing erroneous claims on multiple
policies. One challenge is that graph-based approaches struggle to find
meaningful representations of the data because of the high class imbalance
present in fraud data. Another is that insurance networks are heterogeneous and
dynamic, given the changing relations among people, companies and policies.
That is why gradient boosted tree approaches on tabular data still dominate the
field. Therefore, we present a novel inductive graph gradient boosting machine
(G-GBM) for supervised learning on heterogeneous and dynamic graphs. We show
that our estimator competes with popular graph neural network approaches in an
experiment using a variety of simulated random graphs. We demonstrate the power
of G-GBM for insurance fraud detection using an open-source and a real-world,
proprietary dataset. Given that the backbone model is a gradient boosting
forest, we apply established explainability methods to gain better insights
into the predictions made by G-GBM.

Conclusion: 建立了一个原则性、不确定性感知且结构敏感的量子图神经网络解释方法，为扩展到更广泛架构和真实数据集奠定了基础。

Abstract: Quantum graph neural networks offer a powerful paradigm for learning on
graph-structured data, yet their explainability is complicated by
measurement-induced stochasticity and the combinatorial nature of graph
structure. In this paper, we introduce QuantumGraphLIME (QGraphLIME), a
model-agnostic, post-hoc framework that treats model explanations as
distributions over local surrogates fit on structure-preserving perturbations
of a graph. By aggregating surrogate attributions together with their
dispersion, QGraphLIME yields uncertainty-aware node and edge importance
rankings for quantum graph models. The framework further provides a
distribution-free, finite-sample guarantee on the size of the surrogate
ensemble: a Dvoretzky-Kiefer-Wolfowitz bound ensures uniform approximation of
the induced distribution of a binary class probability at target accuracy and
confidence under standard independence assumptions. Empirical studies on
controlled synthetic graphs with known ground truth demonstrate accurate and
stable explanations, with ablations showing clear benefits of nonlinear
surrogate modeling and highlighting sensitivity to perturbation design.
Collectively, these results establish a principled, uncertainty-aware, and
structure-sensitive approach to explaining quantum graph neural networks, and
lay the groundwork for scaling to broader architectures and real-world
datasets, as quantum resources mature. Code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: vAttention是一种结合top-k和随机采样的稀疏注意力机制，提供用户指定的(ε, δ)近似精度保证，在保持模型质量的同时实现高达20倍的稀疏度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有稀疏注意力方法（top-k和采样）存在根本性限制：无法提供跨头和查询向量的一致性近似，且缺乏近似质量保证，限制了实际部署。

Method: 结合top-k和随机采样的互补优势：top-k在注意力分数由少数token主导时表现好，随机采样在注意力分数相对均匀时提供更好估计。利用采样的统计保证，开发具有(ε, δ)精度保证的vAttention。

Result: vAttention显著提升稀疏注意力质量（Llama-3.1-8B-Inst和Deepseek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B在RULER-HARD上提升约4.5个百分点），在高达20倍稀疏度下匹配完整模型质量，在推理场景中实现快速解码而不影响质量。

Conclusion: vAttention是第一个具有用户指定精度保证的实用稀疏注意力机制，为大规模稀疏注意力的可靠部署迈出了重要一步，提供了优越的质量-效率权衡。

Abstract: State-of-the-art sparse attention methods for reducing decoding latency fall
into two main categories: approximate top-$k$ (and its extension, top-$p$) and
recently introduced sampling-based estimation. However, these approaches are
fundamentally limited in their ability to approximate full attention: they fail
to provide consistent approximations across heads and query vectors and, most
critically, lack guarantees on approximation quality, limiting their practical
deployment. We observe that top-$k$ and random sampling are complementary:
top-$k$ performs well when attention scores are dominated by a few tokens,
whereas random sampling provides better estimates when attention scores are
relatively uniform. Building on this insight and leveraging the statistical
guarantees of sampling, we introduce vAttention, the first practical sparse
attention mechanism with user-specified $(\epsilon, \delta)$ guarantees on
approximation accuracy (thus, verified). These guarantees make vAttention a
compelling step toward practical, reliable deployment of sparse attention at
scale. By unifying top-k and sampling, vAttention outperforms both
individually, delivering a superior quality-efficiency trade-off. Our
experiments show that vAttention significantly improves the quality of sparse
attention (e.g., $\sim$4.5 percentage points for Llama-3.1-8B-Inst and
Deepseek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B on RULER-HARD), and effectively bridges the gap
between full and sparse attention (e.g., across datasets, it matches full model
quality with upto 20x sparsity). We also demonstrate that it can be deployed in
reasoning scenarios to achieve fast decoding without compromising model quality
(e.g., vAttention achieves full model quality on AIME2024 at 10x sparsity with
up to 32K token generations). Code is open-sourced at

Result: 在PKU-SafeRLHF数据集上的实验结果表明该方法有效，显著降低了内存和计算成本。

Conclusion: 该方法为LLM的安全对齐提供了一种高效且理论保证的解决方案，无需额外先验知识，并可扩展到在线数据设置。

Abstract: The widespread application of Large Language Models (LLMs) imposes increasing
demands on safety, such as reducing harmful content and fake information, and
avoiding certain forbidden tokens due to rules and laws. While there have been
several recent works studying safe alignment of LLMs, these works either
require the training of reward and cost models and incur high memory and
computational costs, or need prior knowledge about the optimal solution.
Motivated by this fact, we study the problem of constrained alignment in LLMs,
i.e., maximizing the output reward while restricting the cost due to
potentially unsafe content to stay below a threshold. For this problem, we
propose a novel primal-dual DPO approach, which first trains a model using
standard DPO on reward preference data to provide reward information, and then
adopts a rearranged Lagrangian DPO objective utilizing the provided reward
information to fine-tune LLMs on cost preference data. Our approach
significantly reduces memory and computational costs, and does not require
extra prior knowledge. Moreover, we establish rigorous theoretical guarantees
on the suboptimality and constraint violation of the output policy. We also
extend our approach to an online data setting by incorporating exploration
bonuses, which enables our approach to explore uncovered prompt-response space,
and then provide theoretical results that get rid of the dependence on
preference data coverage. Experimental results on the widely-used preference
dataset PKU-SafeRLHF demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: Unsupervised representation learning, particularly sequential
disentanglement, aims to separate static and dynamic factors of variation in
data without relying on labels. This remains a challenging problem, as existing
approaches based on variational autoencoders and generative adversarial
networks often rely on multiple loss terms, complicating the optimization
process. Furthermore, sequential disentanglement methods face challenges when
applied to real-world data, and there is currently no established evaluation
protocol for assessing their performance in such settings. Recently, diffusion
models have emerged as state-of-the-art generative models, but no theoretical
formalization exists for their application to sequential disentanglement. In
this work, we introduce the Diffusion Sequential Disentanglement Autoencoder
(DiffSDA), a novel, modal-agnostic framework effective across diverse
real-world data modalities, including time series, video, and audio. DiffSDA
leverages a new probabilistic modeling, latent diffusion, and efficient
samplers, while incorporating a challenging evaluation protocol for rigorous
testing. Our experiments on diverse real-world benchmarks demonstrate that
DiffSDA outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods in sequential
disentanglement.

Conclusion: NGLGE模型通过自适应图学习和灵活模式挖掘，有效提升了图嵌入方法在不同场景下的适应性和性能表现。

Abstract: Graph embedding has been widely applied in areas such as network analysis,
social network mining, recommendation systems, and bioinformatics. However,
current graph construction methods often require the prior definition of
neighborhood size, limiting the effective revelation of potential structural
correlations in the data. Additionally, graph embedding methods using linear
projection heavily rely on a singular pattern mining approach, resulting in
relative weaknesses in adapting to different scenarios. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel model, Neighborhood-Adaptive Generalized Linear
Graph Embedding (NGLGE), grounded in latent pattern mining. This model
introduces an adaptive graph learning method tailored to the neighborhood,
effectively revealing intrinsic data correlations. Simultaneously, leveraging a
reconstructed low-rank representation and imposing $\ell_{2,0}$ norm constraint
on the projection matrix allows for flexible exploration of additional pattern
information. Besides, an efficient iterative solving algorithm is derived for
the proposed model. Comparative evaluations on datasets from diverse scenarios
demonstrate the superior performance of our model compared to state-of-the-art

### [173] [Improving Discrete Diffusion Unmasking Policies Beyond Explicit Reference Policies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05725)
*Chunsan Hong,Seonho An,Min-Soo Kim,Jong Chul Ye*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种学习型调度器来替代掩码扩散模型中的启发式调度策略，通过KL正则化马尔可夫决策过程优化去噪顺序，在多个基准测试中显著优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 掩码扩散模型的性能对去噪顺序高度敏感，现有启发式调度方法（如最大置信度）效果有限，需要更智能的调度策略。

Method: 将去噪过程建模为KL正则化马尔可夫决策过程，使用显式参考策略，优化具有策略改进和收敛保证的正则化目标。

Result: 在四个基准测试中，学习型调度器始终优于最大置信度方法，在SUDOKU任务上比随机调度提升20.1%，比最大置信度提升11.2%。

Conclusion: 学习型调度器能够生成更接近数据分布的样本，证明了基于学习的调度策略优于传统启发式方法。

Abstract: Masked diffusion models (MDMs) have recently emerged as a novel framework for
language modeling. MDMs generate sentences by iteratively denoising masked
sequences, filling in [MASK] tokens step by step. Although MDMs support
any-order sampling, performance is highly sensitive to the choice of which
position to unmask next. Prior work typically relies on rule-based schedules
(e.g., max-confidence, max-margin), which provide ad hoc improvements. In
contrast, we replace these heuristics with a learned scheduler. Specifically,
we cast denoising as a KL-regularized Markov decision process (MDP) with an
explicit reference policy and optimize a regularized objective that admits
policy improvement and convergence guarantees under standard assumptions. We
prove that the optimized policy under this framework generates samples that
more closely match the data distribution than heuristic schedules. Empirically,
across four benchmarks, our learned policy consistently outperforms
max-confidence: for example, on SUDOKU, where unmasking order is critical, it
yields a 20.1% gain over random and a 11.2% gain over max-confidence.

TL;DR: 在4玩家猎鹿游戏中，简单的单字沟通将合作率从0%提升至48.3%，而课程学习在迭代公共物品惩罚游戏中反而使收益降低27.4%。沟通比基于经验的训练更可靠，课程设计需注意游戏序列中的战略教训。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究多智能体LLM系统中的合作激发方法，探讨直接沟通和课程学习两种途径在AI对齐中的效果。

Method: 在4玩家猎鹿游戏中测试单字"廉价谈话"沟通渠道，在迭代公共物品惩罚游戏中实施教学课程学习，通过逐步复杂的游戏序列进行训练。

Result: 沟通显著提升合作率（0%→48.3%），而课程学习反而降低收益27.4%，强调背叛均衡的游戏会诱导智能体产生"习得性悲观"。

Conclusion: 对于协调问题，简单的沟通协议比基于经验的训练更可靠，社交困境的课程设计需要仔细考虑游戏序列中嵌入的战略教训。

Abstract: Eliciting cooperation in multi-agent LLM systems is critical for AI
alignment. We investigate two approaches: direct communication and curriculum
learning. In a 4-player Stag Hunt, a one-word "cheap talk" channel increases
cooperation from 0% to 48.3%, demonstrating communication as a robust
coordination mechanism. In contrast, we find that curriculum learning is highly
sensitive to design choices: our pedagogical curriculum through progressively
complex games reduced agent payoffs by 27.4% in an Iterated Public Goods Game
with Punishment. Qualitative analysis reveals that curricula emphasizing
defection-equilibrium games can induce "learned pessimism" in agents. These
findings suggest that for coordination problems, simple communication protocols
may be more reliable than experience-based training, and that curriculum design
for social dilemmas requires careful attention to the strategic lessons
embedded in game sequences.

### [175] [Are Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks Truly Effective? A Causal Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05750)
*Xiao Yang,Xuejiao Zhao,Zhiqi Shen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究通过因果效应估计框架系统分析了异质图神经网络(HGNNs)的有效性，发现模型架构对性能没有因果影响，而异质信息通过增加同质性和局部-全局分布差异来提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究大多默认HGNNs的有效性而未经验证，本研究旨在系统检验HGNNs是否真正有效，以及其性能提升的来源。

Method: 在21个数据集和20个基线模型上进行系统复现和超参数重调，开发因果效应估计框架，通过事实和反事实分析评估候选因素，并使用最小充分调整集、跨方法一致性检查和敏感性分析验证鲁棒性。

Result: 模型架构和复杂度对性能没有因果影响；异质信息通过增加同质性和局部-全局分布差异产生正向因果效应，使节点类别更易区分。

Conclusion: HGNNs的性能提升主要来自异质信息而非模型架构，这为未来研究提供了重要启示：应更关注信息质量而非模型复杂度。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success in node
classification. Building on this progress, heterogeneous graph neural networks
(HGNNs) integrate relation types and node and edge semantics to leverage
heterogeneous information. Causal analysis for HGNNs is advancing rapidly,
aiming to separate genuine causal effects from spurious correlations. However,
whether HGNNs are intrinsically effective remains underexamined, and most
studies implicitly assume rather than establish this effectiveness. In this
work, we examine HGNNs from two perspectives: model architecture and
heterogeneous information. We conduct a systematic reproduction across 21
datasets and 20 baselines, complemented by comprehensive hyperparameter
retuning. To further disentangle the source of performance gains, we develop a
causal effect estimation framework that constructs and evaluates candidate
factors under standard assumptions through factual and counterfactual analyses,
with robustness validated via minimal sufficient adjustment sets, cross-method
consistency checks, and sensitivity analyses. Our results lead to two
conclusions. First, model architecture and complexity have no causal effect on
performance. Second, heterogeneous information exerts a positive causal effect
by increasing homophily and local-global distribution discrepancy, which makes
node classes more distinguishable. The implementation is publicly available at
https://github.com/YXNTU/CausalHGNN.

TL;DR: 本文比较了迁移学习场景下多种成员推理攻击(MIA)的性能，发现没有单一MIA能捕获所有隐私风险。LiRA在大多数情况下表现最佳，而IHA在PatchCamelyon数据集的高数据量场景中更有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着基础模型的出现，训练范式从从头训练转向迁移学习，这使得在敏感应用中使用小型领域特定数据集进行高效训练成为可能。需要评估迁移学习模型面临的隐私泄露风险。

Method: 在迁移学习设置下比较多种成员推理攻击(MIA)的性能，包括基于分数的MIA和似然比攻击(LiRA)、逆Hessian攻击(IHA)等。

Result: 攻击效能随着训练数据量的增加而降低；没有单一MIA能捕获所有隐私风险；LiRA在大多数实验场景中表现最佳；IHA在PatchCamelyon数据集的高数据量场景中更有效。

Conclusion: 迁移学习模型面临多样化的隐私风险，需要根据具体场景选择合适的MIA进行隐私风险评估，LiRA是通用性较好的选择，但在特定情况下IHA可能更有效。

Abstract: With the emergence of powerful large-scale foundation models, the training
paradigm is increasingly shifting from from-scratch training to transfer
learning. This enables high utility training with small, domain-specific
datasets typical in sensitive applications.Membership inference attacks (MIAs)
provide an empirical estimate of the privacy leakage by machine learning
models. Yet, prior assessments of MIAs against models fine-tuned with transfer
learning rely on a small subset of possible attacks. We address this by
comparing performance of diverse MIAs in transfer learning settings to help
practitioners identify the most efficient attacks for privacy risk evaluation.
We find that attack efficacy decreases with the increase in training data for
score-based MIAs. We find that there is no one MIA which captures all privacy
risks in models trained with transfer learning. While the Likelihood Ratio
Attack (LiRA) demonstrates superior performance across most experimental
scenarios, the Inverse Hessian Attack (IHA) proves to be more effective against
models fine-tuned on PatchCamelyon dataset in high data regime.

*Shadi Rahimian,Mario Fritz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种使用时间非齐次隐马尔可夫模型生成合成SNP序列数据的隐私保护框架，通过限制每个SNP序列在训练中的影响来提供差分隐私保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SNP数据集对遗传学研究至关重要，但共享时存在严重的隐私风险，现有隐私保护方法要么对统计摘要应用差分隐私，要么需要复杂的后处理和公开数据集。

Method: 使用时间非齐次隐马尔可夫模型生成合成SNP序列数据，通过限制每个SNP序列的梯度贡献来确保差分隐私保证，直接处理SNP之间的相关性带来的隐私风险。

Result: 在1000 Genomes数据集上的实验表明，在ε∈[1,10]和δ=10^{-4}的隐私预算下，该方法能有效生成合成数据，通过使HMM的转移模型依赖于序列位置显著提升了性能。

Conclusion: 该框架能够在保护隐私的同时共享基因组数据，为研究人员提供了出色的灵活性和实用性。

Abstract: Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) datasets are fundamental to genetic
studies but pose significant privacy risks when shared. The correlation of SNPs
with each other makes strong adversarial attacks such as masked-value
reconstruction, kin, and membership inference attacks possible. Existing
privacy-preserving approaches either apply differential privacy to statistical
summaries of these datasets or offer complex methods that require
post-processing and the usage of a publicly available dataset to suppress or
selectively share SNPs.
  In this study, we introduce an innovative framework for generating synthetic
SNP sequence datasets using samples derived from time-inhomogeneous hidden
Markov models (TIHMMs). To preserve the privacy of the training data, we ensure
that each SNP sequence contributes only a bounded influence during training,
enabling strong differential privacy guarantees. Crucially, by operating on
full SNP sequences and bounding their gradient contributions, our method
directly addresses the privacy risks introduced by their inherent correlations.
  Through experiments conducted on the real-world 1000 Genomes dataset, we
demonstrate the efficacy of our method using privacy budgets of $\varepsilon
\in [1, 10]$ at $\delta=10^{-4}$. Notably, by allowing the transition models of
the HMM to be dependent on the location in the sequence, we significantly
enhance performance, enabling the synthetic datasets to closely replicate the
statistical properties of non-private datasets. This framework facilitates the
private sharing of genomic data while offering researchers exceptional
flexibility and utility.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种改进的数据集压缩方法，用平滑的贝塞尔曲线替代噪声较大的完整SGD轨迹作为监督信号，解决了现有方法中梯度不稳定、收敛慢和存储开销大的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集压缩方法使用完整的随机梯度下降轨迹作为对齐目标，但这些轨迹通常噪声大、曲率高且存储密集，导致梯度不稳定、收敛缓慢和内存开销大。

Method: 用连接初始和最终模型状态的二次贝塞尔曲线作为平滑、低损失的参数化替代，替代完整的SGD轨迹，提供无噪声、低曲率的监督信号。

Result: 该方法在五个临床数据集上优于最先进的压缩方法，生成的压缩数据集能够支持有效的临床模型开发。

Conclusion: 贝塞尔模式连接作为SGD路径的有效替代，能够稳定梯度、加速收敛并消除密集轨迹存储需求，在临床数据集压缩中表现出色。

Abstract: Dataset condensation (DC) enables the creation of compact, privacy-preserving
synthetic datasets that can match the utility of real patient records,
supporting democratised access to highly regulated clinical data for developing
downstream clinical models. State-of-the-art DC methods supervise synthetic
data by aligning the training dynamics of models trained on real and those
trained on synthetic data, typically using full stochastic gradient descent
(SGD) trajectories as alignment targets; however, these trajectories are often
noisy, high-curvature, and storage-intensive, leading to unstable gradients,
slow convergence, and substantial memory overhead. We address these limitations
by replacing full SGD trajectories with smooth, low-loss parametric surrogates,
specifically quadratic B\'ezier curves that connect the initial and final model
states from real training trajectories. These mode-connected paths provide
noise-free, low-curvature supervision signals that stabilise gradients,
accelerate convergence, and eliminate the need for dense trajectory storage. We
theoretically justify B\'ezier-mode connections as effective surrogates for SGD
paths and empirically show that the proposed method outperforms
state-of-the-art condensation approaches across five clinical datasets,
yielding condensed datasets that enable clinically effective model development.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Entropic Particle Filtering (ePF)方法，通过Entropic Annealing和Look-ahead Modulation技术解决粒子滤波在推理时缩放中的粒子贫化问题，显著提升数学推理任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统粒子滤波方法在复杂数学推理任务中容易受到过程奖励模型过度自信评分的影响，导致过早利用局部有希望的轨迹，剪枝潜在正确假设，最终收敛到次优解，这种现象在计算预算受限时尤为严重。

Method: ePF整合了两种新技术：1) Entropic Annealing通过监控搜索多样性，在多样性下降时动态退火重采样分布来保持探索；2) Look-ahead Modulation添加预测性指导，基于后继状态评估状态的潜力。

Result: 在多个具有挑战性的数学基准测试中，ePF显著优于强基线方法，任务奖励相对提升高达50%。

Conclusion: ePF通过平衡多样化解空间的探索与高奖励区域的利用，提高了粒子滤波的鲁棒性，最终获得更高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: Inference-Time Scaling (ITS) improves language models by allocating more
computation at generation time. Particle Filtering (PF) has emerged as a strong
ITS method for complex mathematical reasoning tasks, but it is vulnerable when
guided by process reward models, which often assign overconfident scores early
in the reasoning process. This causes PF to suffer from premature exploitation:
it myopically commits to locally promising trajectories, prunes potentially
correct hypotheses, and converges to suboptimal solutions. This failure mode,
known as particle impoverishment, is especially severe under constrained
computational budgets. To address this, we analyze the problem and identify two
root causes: a lack of diversity in the particle set due to overconfident
resampling and consequent inability to assess the potential of a reasoning
path. We introduce Entropic Particle Filtering (ePF), an algorithm that
integrates two new techniques to solve these issues. The first technique,
Entropic Annealing (EA), directly mitigates particle impoverishment by
monitoring search diversity via entropy; when diversity drops, it intervenes by
dynamically annealing the resampling distribution to preserve exploration. The
second, an enhancement called Look-ahead Modulation (LaM), adds a predictive
guide to evaluate a state's potential based on its successors. On several
challenging math benchmarks, ePF significantly outperforms strong baselines and
achieves up to a 50 % relative improvement in task reward. Together, these
methods improve PF's resilience by balancing the exploration of diverse
solution spaces with the exploitation of high-reward regions, ultimately
leading to higher-quality solutions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法将轨迹转换为固定长度表示，忽略了真实轨迹的可变性，导致信息丢失或特征冗余。

Method: 使用模态特定编码器和跨模态交互模块捕捉空间、时间和拓扑语义，动态轨迹建模机制自适应调节不同长度轨迹的信息密度，结合对比对齐和掩码语言建模的自监督预训练目标。

Result: 在三个真实数据集上的实验表明，MDTI持续优于最先进的基线方法，证实了其鲁棒性和强泛化能力。

Conclusion: MDTI框架通过多模态轨迹表示学习有效提升了旅行时间估计的准确性。

Abstract: Accurate travel time estimation (TTE) plays a crucial role in intelligent
transportation systems. However, it remains challenging due to heterogeneous
data sources and complex traffic dynamics. Moreover, conventional approaches
typically convert trajectories into fixed-length representations, neglecting
the inherent variability of real-world trajectories, which often leads to
information loss or feature redundancy. To address these challenges, this paper
introduces the Multimodal Dynamic Trajectory Integration (MDTI) framework--a
novel multimodal trajectory representation learning approach that integrates
GPS sequences, grid trajectories, and road network constraints to enhance TTE
accuracy. MDTI employs modality-specific encoders and a cross-modal interaction
module to capture complementary spatial, temporal, and topological semantics,
while a dynamic trajectory modeling mechanism adaptively regulates information
density for trajectories of varying lengths. Two self-supervised pretraining
objectives, named contrastive alignment and masked language modeling, further
strengthen multimodal consistency and contextual understanding. Extensive
experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that MDTI consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, confirming its robustness and strong
generalization abilities. The code is publicly available at:

Conclusion: ESS-Flow提供了一种梯度无关的条件生成方法，适用于梯度不可靠或不可用的场景，如基于模拟的观测或量化过程。

Abstract: Guiding pretrained flow-based generative models for conditional generation or
to produce samples with desired target properties enables solving diverse tasks
without retraining on paired data. We present ESS-Flow, a gradient-free method
that leverages the typically Gaussian prior of the source distribution in
flow-based models to perform Bayesian inference directly in the source space
using Elliptical Slice Sampling. ESS-Flow only requires forward passes through
the generative model and observation process, no gradient or Jacobian
computations, and is applicable even when gradients are unreliable or
unavailable, such as with simulation-based observations or quantization in the
generation or observation process. We demonstrate its effectiveness on
designing materials with desired target properties and predicting protein
structures from sparse inter-residue distance measurements.

Abstract: This paper studies forecasting of the future distribution of events in human
action sequences, a task essential in domains like retail, finance, healthcare,
and recommendation systems where the precise temporal order is often less
critical than the set of outcomes. We challenge the dominant autoregressive
paradigm and investigate whether explicitly modeling the future distribution or
order-invariant multi-token approaches outperform order-preserving methods. We
analyze local order invariance and introduce a KL-based metric to quantify
temporal drift. We find that a simple explicit distribution forecasting
objective consistently surpasses complex implicit baselines. We further
demonstrate that mode collapse of predicted categories is primarily driven by
distributional imbalance. This work provides a principled framework for
selecting modeling strategies and offers practical guidance for building more
accurate and robust forecasting systems.

Conclusion: MaNGO通过元学习有效解决了图网络模拟器对物理参数变化的敏感性问题，实现了快速适应新参数的能力，在保持准确性的同时提高了效率。

Abstract: Accurately simulating physics is crucial across scientific domains, with
applications spanning from robotics to materials science. While traditional
mesh-based simulations are precise, they are often computationally expensive
and require knowledge of physical parameters, such as material properties. In
contrast, data-driven approaches like Graph Network Simulators (GNSs) offer
faster inference but suffer from two key limitations: Firstly, they must be
retrained from scratch for even minor variations in physical parameters, and
secondly they require labor-intensive data collection for each new parameter
setting. This is inefficient, as simulations with varying parameters often
share a common underlying latent structure. In this work, we address these
challenges by learning this shared structure through meta-learning, enabling
fast adaptation to new physical parameters without retraining. To this end, we
propose a novel architecture that generates a latent representation by encoding
graph trajectories using conditional neural processes (CNPs). To mitigate error
accumulation over time, we combine CNPs with a novel neural operator
architecture. We validate our approach, Meta Neural Graph Operator (MaNGO), on
several dynamics prediction tasks with varying material properties,
demonstrating superior performance over existing GNS methods. Notably, MaNGO
achieves accuracy on unseen material properties close to that of an oracle
model.

Abstract: GeoAI is evolving rapidly, fueled by diverse geospatial datasets like traffic
patterns, environmental data, and crowdsourced OpenStreetMap (OSM) information.
While sophisticated AI models are being developed, existing benchmarks are
often concentrated on single tasks and restricted to a single modality. As
such, progress in GeoAI is limited by the lack of a standardized, multi-task,
modality-agnostic benchmark for their systematic evaluation. This paper
introduces a novel benchmark designed to assess the performance, accuracy, and
efficiency of geospatial embedders. Our benchmark is modality-agnostic and
comprises 7 distinct datasets from diverse cities across three continents,
ensuring generalizability and mitigating demographic biases. It allows for the
evaluation of GeoAI embedders on various phenomena that exhibit underlying
geographic processes. Furthermore, we establish a simple and intuitive
task-oriented model baselines, providing a crucial reference point for
comparing more complex solutions.

Motivation: 虽然JEPA架构中的抗坍缩项通常被视为防止表征坍缩的简单方法，但作者发现它实际上在估计数据密度，这一发现为JEPA模型开辟了新的应用场景。

Method: 通过理论分析证明JEPA的抗坍缩项可以估计数据密度，并提出JEPA-SCORE方法，利用模型的雅可比矩阵在封闭形式下高效计算样本概率。

Conclusion: JEPA架构不仅学习下游任务可用的表征，其抗坍缩项还提供了数据密度估计能力，为数据管理、异常检测等应用提供了新工具。

Abstract: Joint Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPAs) learn representations able
to solve numerous downstream tasks out-of-the-box. JEPAs combine two
objectives: (i) a latent-space prediction term, i.e., the representation of a
slightly perturbed sample must be predictable from the original sample's
representation, and (ii) an anti-collapse term, i.e., not all samples should
have the same representation. While (ii) is often considered as an obvious
remedy to representation collapse, we uncover that JEPAs' anti-collapse term
does much more--it provably estimates the data density. In short, any
successfully trained JEPA can be used to get sample probabilities, e.g., for
data curation, outlier detection, or simply for density estimation. Our
theoretical finding is agnostic of the dataset and architecture used--in any
case one can compute the learned probabilities of sample $x$ efficiently and in
closed-form using the model's Jacobian matrix at $x$. Our findings are
empirically validated across datasets (synthetic, controlled, and Imagenet) and
across different Self Supervised Learning methods falling under the JEPA family
(I-JEPA and DINOv2) and on multimodal models, such as MetaCLIP. We denote the
method extracting the JEPA learned density as {\bf JEPA-SCORE}.

Conclusion: 通过组件级诊断和提出的解决方案，成功解决了现有混合线性注意力方法中线性组件被绕过的问题，实现了平衡的组件使用和有效的性能归因。

Abstract: Transformers' quadratic computational complexity limits their scalability
despite remarkable performance. While linear attention reduces this to linear
complexity, pre-training such models from scratch remains, in most cases,
prohibitively expensive. Recent post-training linearisation methods convert
pre-trained Transformers to linear models efficiently, often using hybrid
approaches that combine linear attention with sliding-window softmax. We
identify a critical flaw: existing hybrid methods inadvertently bypass the
linear component, relying almost entirely on SWA. Component-level diagnostics
reveal this previously undetected behaviour stems from overlooked evaluation
practices on common-sense benchmarks. We propose three solutions to ensure
balanced component usage: (i) inference-time hybridisation of linear-only
conversions with sliding-window softmax; (ii) HedgeCATs, combining
attention-weight transfer with targeted LoRA fine-tuning; and (iii) Scheduled
Sliding-window Dropout (SSD), which stochastically suppresses the softmax
branch during training to prevent component collapse. Our methods maintain
computational efficiency while recovering most base model performance and
ensuring genuine linear attention adoption, restoring the validity of
performance attributions in hybrid conversions.

Motivation: 心电图异常检测对心血管疾病诊断至关重要，需要开发有效的无监督方法来识别异常心电信号。

Method: 使用三种自编码器架构：卷积自编码器、变分自编码器-BiLSTM、以及带多头注意力的VAE-BiLSTM，在正常ECG样本上训练以重建正常心电形态并检测疾病相关偏差。

Result: 在CPSC数据集上，注意力增强的VAE-BiLSTM-MHA表现最佳，AUPRC为0.81，召回率为0.85，优于其他架构。

Conclusion: VAE-BiLSTM-MHA架构在ECG异常检测中表现优异，并已集成到交互式仪表板中用于临床分诊，为首次应用于ECG异常检测。

Abstract: Anomaly detection in 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) is critical for
identifying deviations associated with cardiovascular disease. This work
presents a comparative analysis of three autoencoder-based architectures:
convolutional autoencoder (CAE), variational autoencoder with bidirectional
long short-term memory (VAE-BiLSTM), and VAE-BiLSTM with multi-head attention
(VAE-BiLSTM-MHA), for unsupervised anomaly detection in ECGs. To the best of
our knowledge, this study reports the first application of a VAE-BiLSTM-MHA
architecture to ECG anomaly detection. All models are trained on normal ECG
samples to reconstruct non-anomalous cardiac morphology and detect deviations
indicative of disease. Using a unified preprocessing and evaluation pipeline on
the public China Physiological Signal Challenge (CPSC) dataset, the
attention-augmented VAE achieves the best performance, with an AUPRC of 0.81
and a recall of 0.85 on the held-out test set, outperforming the other
architectures. To support clinical triage, this model is further integrated
into an interactive dashboard that visualizes anomaly localization. In
addition, a performance comparison with baseline models from the literature is
provided.

TL;DR: CDC-FM是一种改进的流匹配方法，通过使用几何感知噪声来正则化概率路径，从而改善生成模型的质量与泛化能力之间的权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度生成模型在高质量样本生成和避免记忆训练数据之间存在根本性权衡。标准流匹配方法使用同质、各向同性噪声，无法有效捕捉数据几何结构。

Method: 提出Carré du champ流匹配(CDC-FM)，将标准流匹配中的同质噪声替换为空间变化、各向异性的高斯噪声，其协方差能够捕捉潜在数据流形的局部几何结构。

Result: 在多种数据集和神经网络架构上的实验表明，CDC-FM在质量-泛化权衡方面表现更优，特别是在数据稀缺和非均匀采样场景下显著优于标准流匹配。

Conclusion: CDC-FM为研究生成模型中数据几何、泛化和记忆化之间的相互作用提供了数学框架，并提供了一个可轻松集成到现有流匹配流程中的鲁棒且可扩展的算法。

Abstract: Deep generative models often face a fundamental tradeoff: high sample quality
can come at the cost of memorisation, where the model reproduces training data
rather than generalising across the underlying data geometry. We introduce
Carr\'e du champ flow matching (CDC-FM), a generalisation of flow matching
(FM), that improves the quality-generalisation tradeoff by regularising the
probability path with a geometry-aware noise. Our method replaces the
homogeneous, isotropic noise in FM with a spatially varying, anisotropic
Gaussian noise whose covariance captures the local geometry of the latent data
manifold. We prove that this geometric noise can be optimally estimated from
the data and is scalable to large data. Further, we provide an extensive
experimental evaluation on diverse datasets (synthetic manifolds, point clouds,
single-cell genomics, animal motion capture, and images) as well as various
neural network architectures (MLPs, CNNs, and transformers). We demonstrate
that CDC-FM consistently offers a better quality-generalisation tradeoff. We
observe significant improvements over standard FM in data-scarce regimes and in
highly non-uniformly sampled datasets, which are often encountered in AI for
science applications. Our work provides a mathematical framework for studying
the interplay between data geometry, generalisation and memorisation in
generative models, as well as a robust and scalable algorithm that can be
readily integrated into existing flow matching pipelines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高维数据在机器学习中普遍存在，现有基于LLM的特征选择方法缺乏结构化推理和透明决策依据

Method: 设计多智能体架构，让不同角色的LLM智能体通过集体评估特征相关性和生成详细理由来进行特征选择

Result: 在CIC-DIAD 2024物联网入侵检测数据集上，LLM-FS-Agent达到优于或可比拟的分类性能，平均减少46%下游训练时间

Conclusion: 提出的审议架构提升了决策透明度和计算效率，使LLM-FS-Agent成为实际应用的实用可靠解决方案

Abstract: High-dimensional data remains a pervasive challenge in machine learning,
often undermining model interpretability and computational efficiency. While
Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise for dimensionality reduction
through feature selection, existing LLM-based approaches frequently lack
structured reasoning and transparent justification for their decisions. This
paper introduces LLM-FS-Agent, a novel multi-agent architecture designed for
interpretable and robust feature selection. The system orchestrates a
deliberative "debate" among multiple LLM agents, each assigned a specific role,
enabling collective evaluation of feature relevance and generation of detailed
justifications. We evaluate LLM-FS-Agent in the cybersecurity domain using the
CIC-DIAD 2024 IoT intrusion detection dataset and compare its performance
against strong baselines, including LLM-Select and traditional methods such as
PCA. Experimental results demonstrate that LLM-FS-Agent consistently achieves
superior or comparable classification performance while reducing downstream
training time by an average of 46% (statistically significant improvement, p =
0.028 for XGBoost). These findings highlight that the proposed deliberative
architecture enhances both decision transparency and computational efficiency,
establishing LLM-FS-Agent as a practical and reliable solution for real-world
applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于正确性而非置信度的解码策略，通过在不同置信度步骤采用贪婪采样和基于正确性的截断阈值，解决了LLM在复杂推理任务中探索多样性与保证准确性之间的冲突。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在LLM复杂推理任务中存在冲突：一方面需要增加随机性来探索多种推理路径，另一方面又要确保每条路径的准确性。传统方法将置信度与答案质量直接关联，但混淆了不同来源的不确定性。

Method: 提出三种简单策略：Greedy-Threshold在极低置信度步骤采用贪婪采样；Calibrated-TopK和Calibrated-epsilon基于估计的按排名正确性设置截断阈值，从预计正确性高的token中采样，减少预计正确性低处的采样。

Result: 在数学和通用推理基准测试中取得了性能提升，挑战了现有关于不确定性下解码的启发式方法。

Conclusion: 解码规则应该基于正确性而非仅置信度进行校准，这种方法能够更好地平衡探索多样性与保证准确性的需求。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to complex tasks that
require extended reasoning. In such settings, models often benefit from diverse
chains-of-thought to arrive at multiple candidate solutions. This requires two
competing objectives: to inject enough stochasticity to explore multiple
reasoning chains, and to ensure sufficient accuracy and quality in each path.
Existing works pursue the first objective by increasing exploration at highly
uncertain steps with higher temperature or larger candidate token sets, while
others improve reliability by rejecting samples with low confidence
post-generation, implying that low confidence correlates with low answer
quality. These two lines of thought are in conflict, as they conflate different
sources of uncertainty. To resolve this, we argue that the decoding rule should
be calibrated by correctness, not confidence alone. We should sample from
tokens with higher estimated correctness, and reduce sampling where expected
correctness is low. We propose simple strategies that achieve this goal:
Greedy-Threshold makes sampling greedy at very low confidence steps.
Calibrated-TopK and Calibrated-epsilon set truncation threshold based on
estimated rank-wise correctness. Together, our findings challenge prevailing
heuristics about decoding under uncertainty and show gains across math and
general reasoning benchmarks.

TL;DR: RamPINN：一种基于物理信息的神经网络，通过双解码器架构从CARS光谱中恢复拉曼光谱，利用Kramers-Kronig因果关系和光滑性先验实现零样本泛化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习在科学领域的应用受到大规模数据集缺乏的限制。科学理论提供的物理定律可作为可靠的归纳偏置，特别是在数据稀缺的知识密集型领域。

Method: 提出RamPINN模型，采用双解码器架构分离谐振和非谐振信号，通过可微希尔伯特变换损失强制执行Kramers-Kronig因果关系，并对非谐振部分施加光滑性先验。

Result: 完全在合成数据上训练的RamPINN在真实实验数据上表现出强大的零样本泛化能力，显著优于现有基线方法。仅使用物理损失训练（无需真实拉曼光谱）也能获得有竞争力的结果。

Conclusion: 正式科学规则可作为强大的归纳偏置，在数据有限的科学领域实现鲁棒的自监督学习。

Abstract: Transferring the recent advancements in deep learning into scientific
disciplines is hindered by the lack of the required large-scale datasets for
training. We argue that in these knowledge-rich domains, the established body
of scientific theory provides reliable inductive biases in the form of
governing physical laws. We address the ill-posed inverse problem of recovering
Raman spectra from noisy Coherent Anti-Stokes Raman Scattering (CARS)
measurements, as the true Raman signal here is suppressed by a dominating
non-resonant background. We propose RamPINN, a model that learns to recover
Raman spectra from given CARS spectra. Our core methodological contribution is
a physics-informed neural network that utilizes a dual-decoder architecture to
disentangle resonant and non-resonant signals. This is done by enforcing the
Kramers-Kronig causality relations via a differentiable Hilbert transform loss
on the resonant and a smoothness prior on the non-resonant part of the signal.
Trained entirely on synthetic data, RamPINN demonstrates strong zero-shot
generalization to real-world experimental data, explicitly closing this gap and
significantly outperforming existing baselines. Furthermore, we show that
training with these physics-based losses alone, without access to any
ground-truth Raman spectra, still yields competitive results. This work
highlights a broader concept: formal scientific rules can act as a potent
inductive bias, enabling robust, self-supervised learning in data-limited
scientific domains.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于期望logit向量的贝叶斯后验OOD检测方法，在小样本训练场景下，贝叶斯方法优于确定性方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: OOD检测对AI可靠性和安全性至关重要，但在实际应用中训练数据往往有限。贝叶斯神经网络能显式表示认知不确定性，在小样本场景下尤其有价值。

Method: 引入基于期望logit向量的贝叶斯后验OOD评分家族，比较了5种贝叶斯和4种确定性后验OOD评分方法。

Result: 在MNIST和CIFAR-10数据集上，使用5000或更少训练样本的实验表明，贝叶斯方法优于相应的确定性方法。

Conclusion: 贝叶斯方法在小样本OOD检测任务中表现出色，验证了其在处理认知不确定性方面的优势。

Abstract: Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection is critical to AI reliability and safety,
yet in many practical settings, only a limited amount of training data is
available. Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) are a promising class of model on
which to base OOD detection, because they explicitly represent epistemic (i.e.
model) uncertainty. In the small training data regime, BNNs are especially
valuable because they can incorporate prior model information. We introduce a
new family of Bayesian posthoc OOD scores based on expected logit vectors, and
compare 5 Bayesian and 4 deterministic posthoc OOD scores. Experiments on MNIST
and CIFAR-10 In-Distributions, with 5000 training samples or less, show that
the Bayesian methods outperform corresponding deterministic methods.

Motivation: 研究在过参数化插值机制下，即使对于不可能数据（如分类中的随机标签）也能获得低训练误差时，Gibbs算法的泛化性能。

Method: 使用数据依赖的边界分析Gibbs算法，并通过Langevin Monte Carlo算法进行稳定近似，在MNIST和CIFAR-10数据集上进行实验验证。

Result: 边界能够对真实标签数据产生非平凡预测，并正确上界随机标签的测试误差，表明低温度插值机制下的泛化性能可以通过经典高温度机制下的小训练误差来预示。

Conclusion: 在过参数化插值机制中，Gibbs算法的泛化性能可以通过数据依赖的边界来量化，且低温度下的泛化能力已在高温度机制的小训练误差中体现。

Abstract: The paper provides data-dependent bounds on the test error of the Gibbs
algorithm in the overparameterized interpolation regime, where low training
errors are also obtained for impossible data, such as random labels in
classification. The bounds are stable under approximation with Langevin Monte
Carlo algorithms. Experiments on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets verify that
the bounds yield nontrivial predictions on true labeled data and correctly
upper bound the test error for random labels. Our method indicates that
generalization in the low-temperature, interpolation regime is already signaled
by small training errors in the more classical high temperature regime.

Motivation: 解决分子表示学习中交叉验证时的特征泄漏问题，同时保持高效计算和准确性能评估。

Method: 提出molFTP表示方法，采用虚拟掩码防止特征泄漏，使用关键留一法近似真实留一法交叉验证。

Result: 关键留一法与真实留一法偏差低于8%，能在几乎全数据训练的同时保持无偏性能估计。

Conclusion: molFTP提供快速、防泄漏的片段-靶点流行度向量化，通过虚拟掩码或关键留一法以低成本近似留一法。

Abstract: We introduce molFTP (molecular fragment-target prevalence), a compact
representation that delivers strong predictive performance. To prevent feature
leakage across cross-validation folds, we implement a dummy-masking procedure
that removes information about fragments present in the held-out molecules. We
further show that key leave-one-out (key-loo) closely approximates true
molecule-level leave-one-out (LOO), with deviation below 8% on our datasets.
This enables near full data training while preserving unbiased cross-validation
estimates of model performance. Overall, molFTP provides a fast,
leakage-resistant fragment-target prevalence vectorization with practical
safeguards (dummy masking or key-LOO) that approximate LOO at a fraction of its
cost.

Conclusion: H-DSAC方法成功解决了真实世界强化学习应用中的关键挑战，为自动驾驶提供了有效的安全学习框架。

Abstract: Autonomous driving with reinforcement learning (RL) has significant
potential. However, applying RL in real-world settings remains challenging due
to the need for safe, efficient, and robust learning. Incorporating human
expertise into the learning process can help overcome these challenges by
reducing risky exploration and improving sample efficiency. In this work, we
propose a reward-free, active human-in-the-loop learning method called
Human-Guided Distributional Soft Actor-Critic (H-DSAC). Our method combines
Proxy Value Propagation (PVP) and Distributional Soft Actor-Critic (DSAC) to
enable efficient and safe training in real-world environments. The key
innovation is the construction of a distributed proxy value function within the
DSAC framework. This function encodes human intent by assigning higher expected
returns to expert demonstrations and penalizing actions that require human
intervention. By extrapolating these labels to unlabeled states, the policy is
effectively guided toward expert-like behavior. With a well-designed state
space, our method achieves real-world driving policy learning within practical
training times. Results from both simulation and real-world experiments
demonstrate that our framework enables safe, robust, and sample-efficient
learning for autonomous driving.

Motivation: 现有数据选择方法依赖外部预训练模型，难以分离数据选择效果与外部模型的影响，且忽略数据在模型完全收敛时的长期影响。

Method: 使用小型代理模型作为LLM替代，通过双层优化训练评分模型来估计训练样本的长期影响力，基于影响力分数选择高质量数据。

Result: 在1B模型设置下，BLISS达到同等性能的速度比现有最优方法快1.7倍，在多个下游任务上表现优异。

Conclusion: BLISS提供了一种轻量级、无需外部模型的数据选择方案，能有效提升LLM预训练效率和下游任务性能。

Abstract: Effective data selection is essential for pretraining large language models
(LLMs), enhancing efficiency and improving generalization to downstream tasks.
However, existing approaches often require leveraging external pretrained
models, making it difficult to disentangle the effects of data selection from
those of the external pretrained models. In addition, they often overlook the
long-term impact of selected data if the model is trained to convergence,
primarily due to the prohibitive cost of full-scale LLM pretraining. In this
paper, we introduce BLISS (\textbf{B}ileve\textbf{L} \textbf{I}nfluence
\textbf{S}coring method for data \textbf{S}election): a lightweight data
selection method that operates entirely \emph{from scratch}, without relying on
any external pretrained oracle models, while explicitly accounting for the
long-term impact of selected data. BLISS leverages a small proxy model as a
surrogate for the LLM and employs a score model to estimate the long-term
influence of training samples if the proxy model is trained to convergence. We
formulate data selection as a bilevel optimization problem, where the
upper-level objective optimizes the score model to assign importance weights to
training samples, ensuring that minimizing the lower-level objective (i.e.,
training the proxy model over the weighted training loss until convergence)
leads to best validation performance. Once optimized, the trained score model
predicts influence scores for the dataset, enabling efficient selection of
high-quality samples for LLM pretraining. We validate BLISS by pretraining
410M/1B/2.8B Pythia and LLaMA-0.5B models on selected subsets of the C4
dataset. Notably, under the 1B model setting, BLISS achieves $1.7\times$
speedup in reaching the same performance as the state-of-the-art method,
demonstrating superior performance across multiple downstream tasks.

Motivation: 现有的时间点过程建模方法大多依赖自回归参数化，受限于顺序采样。最近的非自回归扩散式模型通过离散马尔可夫链中的事件插入和删除操作来缓解这些问题，但仍有改进空间。

Method: 引入编辑流过程，通过插入、删除和替换三种编辑操作在连续时间马尔可夫链框架中学习瞬时编辑速率，实现从噪声到数据的传输。

Result: 无条件训练模型在基准TPPs的各种无条件和条件生成任务中表现出生成灵活性，有效减少了生成过程中所需的编辑操作数量。

Conclusion: 编辑流过程为时间点过程提供了一种灵活高效的建模方法，通过编辑操作在连续时间框架中实现有效的生成过程。

Abstract: Temporal point processes (TPPs) are a fundamental tool for modeling event
sequences in continuous time, but most existing approaches rely on
autoregressive parameterizations that are limited by their sequential sampling.
Recent non-autoregressive, diffusion-style models mitigate these issues by
jointly interpolating between noise and data through event insertions and
deletions in a discrete Markov chain. In this work, we generalize this
perspective and introduce an Edit Flow process for TPPs that transports noise
to data via insert, delete, and substitute edit operations. By learning the
instantaneous edit rates within a continuous-time Markov chain framework, we
attain a flexible and efficient model that effectively reduces the total number
of necessary edit operations during generation. Empirical results demonstrate
the generative flexibility of our unconditionally trained model in a wide range
of unconditional and conditional generation tasks on benchmark TPPs.

Motivation: 研究深度图神经网络中导致过度平滑效应的因素，特别是量化过度平滑程度并分析其与模型参数的关系。

Method: 提出MASED度量标准来量化过度平滑，推导层间边界，分析节点嵌入范数和权重矩阵奇异值的影响，并引入G-Reg正则化方案。

Conclusion: 通过MASED度量可以更好地理解过度平滑现象，G-Reg正则化能有效缓解该问题，使深度GNN在某些任务中超越浅层网络性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we study the factors that contribute to the effect of
oversmoothing in deep Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Specifically, our analysis
is based on a new metric (Mean Average Squared Distance - $MASED$) to quantify
the extent of oversmoothing. We derive layer-wise bounds on $MASED$, which
aggregate to yield global upper and lower distance bounds. Based on this
quantification of oversmoothing, we further analyze the importance of two
different properties of the model; namely the norms of the generated node
embeddings, along with the largest and smallest singular values of the weight
matrices. Building on the insights drawn from the theoretical analysis, we show
that oversmoothing increases as the number of trainable weight matrices and the
number of adjacency matrices increases. We also use the derived layer-wise
bounds on $MASED$ to form a proposal for decoupling the number of hops (i.e.,
adjacency depth) from the number of weight matrices. In particular, we
introduce G-Reg, a regularization scheme that increases the bounds, and
demonstrate through extensive experiments that by doing so node classification
accuracy increases, achieving robustness at large depths. We further show that
by reducing oversmoothing in deep networks, we can achieve better results in
some tasks than using shallow ones. Specifically, we experiment with a ``cold
start" scenario, i.e., when there is no feature information for the unlabeled
nodes. Finally, we show empirically the trade-off between receptive field size
(i.e., number of weight matrices) and performance, using the $MASED$ bounds.
This is achieved by distributing adjacency hops across a small number of
trainable layers, avoiding the extremes of under- or over-parameterization of
the GNN.

Motivation: 当前AI模型基准测试很少针对散点图这一常见图表类型，限制了对其性能的深入了解，因此需要专门的散点图基准测试。

Method: 创建包含6个数据生成器和17种图表设计的合成散点图数据集，使用N-shot提示法评估OpenAI和Google的专有模型在5个基于聚类边界框、中心坐标和异常值坐标的任务上的表现。

Result: OpenAI模型和Gemini 2.5 Flash在聚类计数任务上表现良好（准确率90%+），但在定位任务上表现不佳（精确率和召回率接近或低于50%），只有Flash在异常值识别上达到65.01%。图表设计的影响较小，但应避免宽高比（16:9和21:9）和随机着色的散点图。

Conclusion: 当前AI模型在散点图分析任务上存在局限性，特别是在定位相关任务上表现不佳，需要进一步改进。建议避免使用特定设计的散点图以获得更好的模型性能。

Abstract: AI models are increasingly used for data analysis and visualization, yet
benchmarks rarely address scatterplot-specific tasks, limiting insight into
performance. To address this gap for one of the most common chart types, we
introduce a synthetic, annotated dataset of over 18,000 scatterplots from six
data generators and 17 chart designs, and a benchmark based on it. We evaluate
proprietary models from OpenAI and Google using N-shot prompting on five
distinct tasks derived from annotations of cluster bounding boxes, their center
coordinates, and outlier coordinates. OpenAI models and Gemini 2.5 Flash,
especially when prompted with examples, are viable options for counting
clusters and, in Flash's case, outliers (90%+ Accuracy). However, the results
for localization-related tasks are unsatisfactory: Precision and Recall are
near or below 50%, except for Flash in outlier identification (65.01%).
Furthermore, the impact of chart design on performance appears to be a
secondary factor, but it is advisable to avoid scatterplots with wide aspect
ratios (16:9 and 21:9) or those colored randomly. Supplementary materials are

TL;DR: 提出Tensor-EM方法，结合张量矩方法和EM算法的优势，用于学习线性动态系统混合模型(MoLDS)，在神经数据分析中提供全局可识别性保证和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决MoLDS在复杂噪声环境下应用的挑战，克服纯张量方法在噪声下性能下降和EM方法对初始化敏感、易陷入局部最优的问题。

Method: 使用输入输出数据构建矩张量来恢复混合权重和系统参数的全局一致估计，然后通过Kalman EM算法进行细化，对所有LDS参数进行闭式更新。

Result: 在合成数据上比纯张量或随机初始化EM方法具有更可靠的恢复和更好的鲁棒性；在真实神经数据中成功建模和聚类不同条件为独立子系统。

Conclusion: MoLDS为复杂神经数据建模提供了有效框架，Tensor-EM是学习MoLDS的可靠方法，适用于神经科学应用。

Abstract: Mixtures of linear dynamical systems (MoLDS) provide a path to model
time-series data that exhibit diverse temporal dynamics across trajectories.
However, its application remains challenging in complex and noisy settings,
limiting its effectiveness for neural data analysis. Tensor-based moment
methods can provide global identifiability guarantees for MoLDS, but their
performance degrades under noise and complexity. Commonly used
expectation-maximization (EM) methods offer flexibility in fitting latent
models but are highly sensitive to initialization and prone to poor local
minima. Here, we propose a tensor-based method that provides identifiability
guarantees for learning MoLDS, which is followed by EM updates to combine the
strengths of both approaches. The novelty in our approach lies in the
construction of moment tensors using the input-output data to recover globally
consistent estimates of mixture weights and system parameters. These estimates
can then be refined through a Kalman EM algorithm, with closed-form updates for
all LDS parameters. We validate our framework on synthetic benchmarks and
real-world datasets. On synthetic data, the proposed Tensor-EM method achieves
more reliable recovery and improved robustness compared to either pure tensor
or randomly initialized EM methods. We then analyze neural recordings from the
primate somatosensory cortex while a non-human primate performs reaches in
different directions. Our method successfully models and clusters different
conditions as separate subsystems, consistent with supervised single-LDS fits
for each condition. Finally, we apply this approach to another neural dataset
where monkeys perform a sequential reaching task. These results demonstrate
that MoLDS provides an effective framework for modeling complex neural data,
and that Tensor-EM is a reliable approach to MoLDS learning for these
applications.

*Nyal Patel,Matthieu Bou,Arjun Jagota,Satyapriya Krishna,Sonali Parbhoo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于失败感知的逆向强化学习算法，专注于被错误分类或难以处理的示例，以更好地恢复RLHF中学习到的潜在奖励函数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLHF虽然能对齐大语言模型与人类偏好，但其内部学习的奖励信号难以解释，现有IRL方法对所有偏好对一视同仁，忽略了最具信息量的失败示例。

Method: 开发了失败感知IRL算法，重点关注被提取的奖励模型错误分类或评分接近的示例，通过这些失败案例学习更准确的奖励函数。

Result: 在LLM去毒任务中，失败感知IRL在多个指标上优于现有IRL基线，无需外部分类器或监督，且提取的奖励能更好地捕获RLHF学习的真实激励。

Conclusion: 失败感知IRL是审计模型对齐和减少IRL过程模糊性的鲁棒、可扩展方法，能实现比标准IRL更有效的重新RLHF训练。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) aligns Large Language
Models (LLMs) with human preferences, yet the underlying reward signals they
internalize remain hidden, posing a critical challenge for interpretability and
safety. Existing approaches attempt to extract these latent incentives using
Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL), but treat all preference pairs equally,
often overlooking the most informative signals: those examples the extracted
reward model misclassifies or assigns nearly equal scores, which we term
\emph{failures}. We introduce a novel \emph{failure-aware} IRL algorithm that
focuses on misclassified or difficult examples to recover the latent rewards
defining model behaviors. By learning from these failures, our failure-aware
IRL extracts reward functions that better reflect the true objectives behind
RLHF. We demonstrate that failure-aware IRL outperforms existing IRL baselines
across multiple metrics when applied to LLM detoxification, without requiring
external classifiers or supervision. Crucially, failure-aware IRL yields
rewards that better capture the true incentives learned during RLHF, enabling
more effective re-RLHF training than standard IRL. This establishes
failure-aware IRL as a robust, scalable method for auditing model alignment and
reducing ambiguity in the IRL process.

*Matthieu Bou,Nyal Patel,Arjun Jagota,Satyapriya Krishna,Sonali Parbhoo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个基于贝叶斯逆强化学习的LLM审计框架，能够推断目标分布、量化非可识别性并提供不确定性感知的诊断工具，以增强LLM的对齐可信度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型隐式优化的目标存在严重不透明性，使得可信对齐和审计成为重大挑战。现有逆强化学习方法要么产生单一过度自信的奖励估计，要么未能解决任务的根本模糊性（非可识别性）。

Method: 采用贝叶斯逆强化学习框架，不仅恢复目标分布，还实现三个关键审计能力：量化并系统减少非可识别性、提供不确定性感知的诊断工具、验证策略级效用。

Result: 经验证明，该框架成功审计了一个经过脱毒的LLM，产生了一个校准良好且可解释的目标，增强了对齐保证。

Conclusion: 这项工作为审计人员、安全团队和监管机构提供了一个实用工具包，用于验证LLM真正试图实现的目标，推动AI向更可信和可问责的方向发展。

Abstract: The objectives that Large Language Models (LLMs) implicitly optimize remain
dangerously opaque, making trustworthy alignment and auditing a grand
challenge. While Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) can infer reward
functions from behaviour, existing approaches either produce a single,
overconfident reward estimate or fail to address the fundamental ambiguity of
the task (non-identifiability). This paper introduces a principled auditing
framework that re-frames reward inference from a simple estimation task to a
comprehensive process for verification. Our framework leverages Bayesian IRL to
not only recover a distribution over objectives but to enable three critical
audit capabilities: (i) Quantifying and systematically reducing
non-identifiability by demonstrating posterior contraction over sequential
rounds of evidence; (ii) Providing actionable, uncertainty-aware diagnostics
that expose spurious shortcuts and identify out-of-distribution prompts where
the inferred objective cannot be trusted; and (iii) Validating policy-level
utility by showing that the refined, low-uncertainty reward can be used
directly in RLHF to achieve training dynamics and toxicity reductions
comparable to the ground-truth alignment process. Empirically, our framework
successfully audits a detoxified LLM, yielding a well-calibrated and
interpretable objective that strengthens alignment guarantees. Overall, this
work provides a practical toolkit for auditors, safety teams, and regulators to
verify what LLMs are truly trying to achieve, moving us toward more trustworthy
and accountable AI.

Motivation: 深度神经网络在统计上难以学习高维任务，但实际表现优异，这表明数据存在潜在结构。论文旨在理解这种结构的本质及其对泛化性能的影响。

Method: 通过研究数据、任务和深度学习表示中的局部性和组合性作用来分析神经网络的学习机制。

Result: 论文揭示了局部性和组合性在神经网络学习高维任务中的关键作用，解释了为何统计上困难的任务在实践中可学习。

Conclusion: 数据中的局部性和组合性结构是深度神经网络成功学习高维任务的关键因素，这为理解神经网络学习机制提供了新视角。

Abstract: Deep neural networks have achieved remarkable success, yet our understanding
of how they learn remains limited. These models can learn high-dimensional
tasks, which is generally statistically intractable due to the curse of
dimensionality. This apparent paradox suggests that learnable data must have an
underlying latent structure. What is the nature of this structure? How do
neural networks encode and exploit it, and how does it quantitatively impact
performance - for instance, how does generalization improve with the number of
training examples? This thesis addresses these questions by studying the roles
of locality and compositionality in data, tasks, and deep learning
representations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对推理数据"质量"的定义不明确，现有方法依赖间接启发式指标，需要更直接的质量评估方法。

Method: 使用影响力函数衡量单个CoT示例对下游准确率的因果效应，提出基于影响力的剪枝策略。

Result: 在模型家族内的数学推理任务中，影响力剪枝方法持续优于困惑度和嵌入基线方法。

Conclusion: 影响力函数为推理数据质量提供了有效的定义和评估方法，基于影响力的剪枝策略能显著提升模型性能。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) on chain-of-thought (CoT) data shows
that a small amount of high-quality data can outperform massive datasets. Yet,
what constitutes "quality" remains ill-defined. Existing reasoning methods rely
on indirect heuristics such as problem difficulty or trace length, while
instruction-tuning has explored a broader range of automated selection
strategies, but rarely in the context of reasoning. We propose to define
reasoning data quality using influence functions, which measure the causal
effect of individual CoT examples on downstream accuracy, and introduce
influence-based pruning, which consistently outperforms perplexity and
embedding-based baselines on math reasoning within a model family.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于图描述符的MMD指标只能相对排序生成模型，无法提供绝对性能度量，且对核函数和描述符参数化高度敏感，导致不同描述符间的结果不可比。

Method: 使用二元分类器区分真实图和生成图，通过图描述符进行特征化，分类器的数据对数似然近似JS距离的变分下界。

Result: PGD指标约束在[0,1]区间内，可在不同图描述符间比较，并推导出理论上有依据的汇总指标。实验表明PGD比MMD指标更鲁棒和具有洞察力。

Conclusion: PGD框架为图生成模型提供了更稳健和可解释的评估方法，解决了MMD指标的局限性。

Abstract: Existing methods for evaluating graph generative models primarily rely on
Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) metrics based on graph descriptors. While these
metrics can rank generative models, they do not provide an absolute measure of
performance. Their values are also highly sensitive to extrinsic parameters,
namely kernel and descriptor parametrization, making them incomparable across
different graph descriptors. We introduce PolyGraph Discrepancy (PGD), a new
evaluation framework that addresses these limitations. It approximates the
Jensen-Shannon distance of graph distributions by fitting binary classifiers to
distinguish between real and generated graphs, featurized by these descriptors.
The data log-likelihood of these classifiers approximates a variational lower
bound on the JS distance between the two distributions. Resulting metrics are
constrained to the unit interval [0,1] and are comparable across different
graph descriptors. We further derive a theoretically grounded summary metric
that combines these individual metrics to provide a maximally tight lower bound
on the distance for the given descriptors. Thorough experiments demonstrate
that PGD provides a more robust and insightful evaluation compared to MMD
metrics. The PolyGraph framework for benchmarking graph generative models is
made publicly available at https://github.com/BorgwardtLab/polygraph-benchmark.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中模型压缩技术往往只关注精度与大小的权衡，忽视了模型忠实性评估，这在医疗、金融等高风险领域尤为重要，压缩模型必须保持与原模型行为的一致性。

Method: 引入忠实性评估指标，包括使用模型一致性评估预测一致性，应用卡方检验检测整体数据集和人口统计子组中预测模式的统计显著变化。

Result: 研究发现高精度并不能保证忠实性，统计测试能够检测到标准指标（如精度和均衡机会）遗漏的细微但显著的变化。

Conclusion: 提出的指标提供了一种实用且更直接的方法，确保通过压缩获得的效率提升不会损害可信AI所必需的公平性或忠实性。

Abstract: In real-world applications, computational constraints often require
transforming large models into smaller, more efficient versions through model
compression. While these techniques aim to reduce size and computational cost
without sacrificing performance, their evaluations have traditionally focused
on the trade-off between size and accuracy, overlooking the aspect of model
faithfulness. This limited view is insufficient for high-stakes domains like
healthcare, finance, and criminal justice, where compressed models must remain
faithful to the behavior of their original counterparts. This paper presents a
novel approach to evaluating faithfulness in compressed models, moving beyond
standard metrics. We introduce and demonstrate a set of faithfulness metrics
that capture how model behavior changes post-compression. Our contributions
include introducing techniques to assess predictive consistency between the
original and compressed models using model agreement, and applying chi-squared
tests to detect statistically significant changes in predictive patterns across
both the overall dataset and demographic subgroups, thereby exposing shifts
that aggregate fairness metrics may obscure. We demonstrate our approaches by
applying quantization and pruning to artificial neural networks (ANNs) trained
on three diverse and socially meaningful datasets. Our findings show that high
accuracy does not guarantee faithfulness, and our statistical tests detect
subtle yet significant shifts that are missed by standard metrics, such as
Accuracy and Equalized Odds. The proposed metrics provide a practical and more
direct method for ensuring that efficiency gains through compression do not
compromise the fairness or faithfulness essential for trustworthy AI.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了lm-Meter，这是首个专为设备端LLM推理设计的轻量级在线延迟分析器，能够在不使用辅助设备的情况下捕获细粒度的实时延迟，为设备端LLM系统提供前所未有的运行时可见性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型越来越多地集成到日常应用中，但其普遍基于云的部署引发了数据隐私和长期可持续性的担忧。在移动和边缘设备上本地运行LLM有望增强隐私性、可靠性和降低通信成本，但由于内存和计算需求巨大，以及在资源受限硬件上性能效率权衡的可见性有限，实现这一愿景仍然具有挑战性。

Method: 开发了lm-Meter，这是一个轻量级的在线延迟分析器，能够在阶段级别（如嵌入、预填充、解码、softmax、采样）和内核级别捕获细粒度的实时延迟，无需辅助设备。在商用移动平台上实现，并展示了其高分析精度和最小的系统开销。

Result: lm-Meter在商用移动平台上实现了高分析精度，在最受限的省电模式下，预填充阶段的吞吐量仅降低2.58%，解码阶段仅降低0.99%。通过lm-Meter进行的实证研究揭示了设备端LLM推理中的阶段和内核级别瓶颈，量化了精度效率权衡，并识别了系统优化机会。

Conclusion: lm-Meter为受限平台上LLM的运行时行为提供了前所未有的可见性，为知情优化奠定了基础，并加速了设备端LLM系统的民主化进程。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into everyday
applications, but their prevalent cloud-based deployment raises growing
concerns around data privacy and long-term sustainability. Running LLMs locally
on mobile and edge devices (on-device LLMs) offers the promise of enhanced
privacy, reliability, and reduced communication costs. However, realizing this
vision remains challenging due to substantial memory and compute demands, as
well as limited visibility into performance-efficiency trade-offs on
resource-constrained hardware. We propose lm-Meter, the first lightweight,
online latency profiler tailored for on-device LLM inference. lm-Meter captures
fine-grained, real-time latency at both phase (e.g., embedding, prefill,
decode, softmax, sampling) and kernel levels without auxiliary devices. We
implement lm-Meter on commercial mobile platforms and demonstrate its high
profiling accuracy with minimal system overhead, e.g., only 2.58% throughput
reduction in prefill and 0.99% in decode under the most constrained Powersave
governor. Leveraging lm-Meter, we conduct comprehensive empirical studies
revealing phase- and kernel-level bottlenecks in on-device LLM inference,
quantifying accuracy-efficiency trade-offs, and identifying systematic
optimization opportunities. lm-Meter provides unprecedented visibility into the
runtime behavior of LLMs on constrained platforms, laying the foundation for
informed optimization and accelerating the democratization of on-device LLM
systems. Code and tutorials are available at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多任务强化学习通常依赖任务元数据（如自然语言描述）来引导不同目标的行为，但如何有效利用这些元数据来索引和组合可重用技能仍是一个挑战。

Method: 提出LEXPOL架构：使用文本编码器编码任务元数据，通过学习的门控模块选择或混合多个子策略，支持跨任务的端到端训练。

Result: 在MetaWorld基准测试中，LEXPOL在成功率和样本效率方面匹配或超过强多任务基线，无需任务特定重训练。学习到的语言门控能够组合专家策略以处理新任务描述和未见任务组合。

Conclusion: 自然语言元数据可以有效地在单一策略中索引和重组可重用技能，为多任务强化学习提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Multi-task reinforcement learning often relies on task metadata -- such as
brief natural-language descriptions -- to guide behavior across diverse
objectives. We present Lexical Policy Networks (LEXPOL), a language-conditioned
mixture-of-policies architecture for multi-task RL. LEXPOL encodes task
metadata with a text encoder and uses a learned gating module to select or
blend among multiple sub-policies, enabling end-to-end training across tasks.
On MetaWorld benchmarks, LEXPOL matches or exceeds strong multi-task baselines
in success rate and sample efficiency, without task-specific retraining. To
analyze the mechanism, we further study settings with fixed expert policies
obtained independently of the gate and show that the learned language gate
composes these experts to produce behaviors appropriate to novel task
descriptions and unseen task combinations. These results indicate that
natural-language metadata can effectively index and recombine reusable skills
within a single policy.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了去中心化随机梯度下降(DSGD)算法在高概率意义下的收敛性，消除了对梯度一致有界等强假设，在轻尾噪声条件下实现了与均方误差收敛相同的条件，同时获得了非凸和强凸成本函数的最优收敛速率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有去中心化设置中的高概率收敛研究需要强假设条件，如梯度一致有界或渐近消失噪声，导致高概率收敛与均方误差收敛之间的假设条件存在显著差距，这与集中式设置中SGD在相同条件下实现两种收敛的情况形成对比。

Method: 通过对感兴趣量（梯度范数平方或最优性间隙）和用户模型间共识间隙的矩生成函数进行精细分析，提出了去中心化方法在高概率意义下的方差缩减效应新结果，以及强凸成本函数下更精细的矩生成函数边界。

Result: 证明了DSGD在轻尾噪声下，在相同于均方误差收敛的条件下实现高概率收敛，消除了梯度一致有界等限制性假设，同时为非凸和强凸成本函数获得了最优收敛速率，并实现了用户数量的线性加速。

Conclusion: DSGD在高概率意义下保持了强性能，与现有均方误差保证相匹配，填补了去中心化设置中高概率收敛与均方误差收敛之间的理论差距。

Abstract: Convergence in high-probability (HP) has been receiving increasing interest,
due to its attractive properties, such as exponentially decaying tail bounds
and strong guarantees for each individual run of an algorithm. While HP
guarantees are extensively studied in centralized settings, much less is
understood in the decentralized, networked setup. Existing HP studies in
decentralized settings impose strong assumptions, like uniformly bounded
gradients, or asymptotically vanishing noise, resulting in a significant gap
between assumptions used to establish convergence in the HP and the
mean-squared error (MSE) sense, even for vanilla Decentralized Stochastic
Gradient Descent ($\mathtt{DSGD}$) algorithm. This is contrary to centralized
settings, where it is known that $\mathtt{SGD}$ converges in HP under the same
conditions on the cost function as needed to guarantee MSE convergence.
Motivated by this observation, we revisit HP guarantees for $\mathtt{DSGD}$ in
the presence of light-tailed noise. We show that $\mathtt{DSGD}$ converges in
HP under the same conditions on the cost as in the MSE sense, removing
uniformly bounded gradients and other restrictive assumptions, while
simultaneously achieving order-optimal rates for both non-convex and strongly
convex costs. Moreover, our improved analysis yields linear speed-up in the
number of users, demonstrating that $\mathtt{DSGD}$ maintains strong
performance in the HP sense and matches existing MSE guarantees. Our improved
results stem from a careful analysis of the MGF of quantities of interest
(norm-squared of gradient or optimality gap) and the MGF of the consensus gap
between users' models. To achieve linear speed-up, we provide a novel result on
the variance-reduction effect of decentralized methods in the HP sense and more
fine-grained bounds on the MGF for strongly convex costs, which are both of
independent interest.

Motivation: 解决异构智能体团队训练中与策略不可访问或非平稳队友（如人类）协作的挑战，避免依赖昂贵的人类参与数据。

Method: 在基于Stag Hunt的网格世界捕获游戏中，通过三个实验评估LLM作为人类代理：比较LLM与人类/专家的决策一致性；通过提示诱导风险敏感策略；在动态网格世界中测试LLM生成的动作轨迹。

Result: LLM决策与专家更一致；通过提示可模拟人类风险敏感行为；在动态环境中生成的轨迹与人类参与者相似。

Conclusion: LLM虽然不能完全复制人类适应性，但其提示引导的多样性为模拟策略不可知队友提供了可扩展的基础。

Abstract: A critical challenge in modelling Heterogeneous-Agent Teams is training
agents to collaborate with teammates whose policies are inaccessible or
non-stationary, such as humans. Traditional approaches rely on expensive
human-in-the-loop data, which limits scalability. We propose using Large
Language Models (LLMs) as policy-agnostic human proxies to generate synthetic
data that mimics human decision-making. To evaluate this, we conduct three
experiments in a grid-world capture game inspired by Stag Hunt, a game theory
paradigm that balances risk and reward. In Experiment 1, we compare decisions
from 30 human participants and 2 expert judges with outputs from LLaMA 3.1 and
Mixtral 8x22B models. LLMs, prompted with game-state observations and reward
structures, align more closely with experts than participants, demonstrating
consistency in applying underlying decision criteria. Experiment 2 modifies
prompts to induce risk-sensitive strategies (e.g. "be risk averse"). LLM
outputs mirror human participants' variability, shifting between risk-averse
and risk-seeking behaviours. Finally, Experiment 3 tests LLMs in a dynamic
grid-world where the LLM agents generate movement actions. LLMs produce
trajectories resembling human participants' paths. While LLMs cannot yet fully
replicate human adaptability, their prompt-guided diversity offers a scalable
foundation for simulating policy-agnostic teammates.

Abstract: Revealing novel insights from the relationship between molecular measurements
and pathology remains a very impactful application of machine learning in
biomedicine. Data in this domain typically contain only a few observations but
thousands of potentially noisy features, posing challenges for conventional
machine learning approaches. While prior-data fitted networks emerge as
foundation models for tabular data, they are currently not suited to handle
large feature counts (>500). Although feature reduction enables their
application, it hinders feature importance analysis. We propose a strategy that
extends existing models through continued pre-training on synthetic data
sampled from a customized prior. The resulting model, TabPFN-Wide, matches or
exceeds its base model's performance while exhibiting improved robustness to
noise. It seamlessly scales beyond 50,000 features, regardless of noise levels,
while maintaining inherent interpretability, which is critical for biomedical
applications. Our results show that prior-informed adaptation is suitable to
enhance the capability of foundation models for high-dimensional data. On
real-world biomedical datasets many of the most relevant features identified by
the model overlap with previous biological findings, while others propose
potential starting points for future studies.

Abstract: Feature attributions are post-training analysis methods that assess how
various input features of a machine learning model contribute to an output
prediction. Their interpretation is straightforward when features act
independently, but becomes less direct when the predictive model involves
interactions such as multiplicative relationships or joint feature
contributions. In this work, we propose a general theory of higher-order
feature attribution, which we develop on the foundation of Integrated Gradients
(IG). This work extends existing frameworks in the literature on explainable
AI. When using IG as the method of feature attribution, we discover natural
connections to statistics and topological signal processing. We provide several
theoretical results that establish the theory, and we validate our theory on a
few examples.

Abstract: We establish a fundamental connection between score-based diffusion models
and non-equilibrium thermodynamics by deriving performance limits based on
entropy rates. Our main theoretical contribution is a lower bound on the
negative log-likelihood of the data that relates model performance to entropy
rates of diffusion processes. We numerically validate this bound on a synthetic
dataset and investigate its tightness. By building a bridge to entropy rates -
system, intrinsic, and exchange entropy - we provide new insights into the
thermodynamic operation of these models, drawing parallels to Maxwell's demon
and implications for thermodynamic computing hardware. Our framework connects
generative modeling performance to fundamental physical principles through
stochastic thermodynamics.

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification (UQ) over graphs arises in a number of
safety-critical applications in network science. The Gaussian process (GP), as
a classical Bayesian framework for UQ, has been developed to handle
graph-structured data by devising topology-aware kernel functions. However,
such GP-based approaches are limited not only by the prohibitive computational
complexity, but also the strict modeling assumptions that might yield poor
coverage, especially with labels arriving on the fly. To effect scalability, we
devise a novel graph-aware parametric GP model by leveraging the random feature
(RF)-based kernel approximation, which is amenable to efficient recursive
Bayesian model updates. To further allow for adaptivity, an ensemble of
graph-aware RF-based scalable GPs have been leveraged, with per-GP weight
adapted to data arriving incrementally. To ensure valid coverage with
robustness to model mis-specification, we wed the GP-based set predictors with
the online conformal prediction framework, which post-processes the prediction
sets using adaptive thresholds. Experimental results the proposed method yields
improved coverage and efficient prediction sets over existing baselines by
adaptively ensembling the GP models and setting the key threshold parameters in
CP.

Abstract: This paper formally studies generation processes, including auto-regressive
next-token prediction and masked diffusion, that abstract beyond architectural
specifics. At this level of abstraction, we quantify their benefits and
limitations through measurable criteria such as computational hardness and
learnability. In particular, we demonstrate that allowing generation to proceed
beyond autoregression and current masked diffusion, with capabilities to
rewrite and length-variable edit, can bring significant theoretical and
empirical advantages, with important implications for frontier LLMs that aspire
to tackle increasingly hard problems and work universally across domains beyond
natural language, such as coding and science.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RGSD算法通过参考数据在语义有意义的潜在空间中实现技能发现，解决了高自由度系统中探索空间指数增长而语义技能有限的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着维度增加，探索空间呈指数级增长，而有意义的技能流形仍然有限，因此语义意义对于有效指导高维空间探索变得至关重要。

Method: RGSD首先进行对比预训练将动作嵌入到单位超球面上，将每个参考轨迹聚类到不同的方向，使技能发现同时涉及参考行为的模仿和语义相关多样化行为的发现。

Result: 在模拟的SMPL人形机器人上，RGSD学习了包括行走、跑步、拳击和侧步在内的结构化技能，并发现了相关的新行为。在下游控制任务中，RGSD优于基于模仿的技能获取基线方法。

Conclusion: 轻量级的参考引导接地为在高自由度系统中发现语义丰富和结构化的技能提供了一条实用路径。

Abstract: Scaling unsupervised skill discovery algorithms to high-DoF agents remains
challenging. As dimensionality increases, the exploration space grows
exponentially, while the manifold of meaningful skills remains limited.
Therefore, semantic meaningfulness becomes essential to effectively guide
exploration in high-dimensional spaces. In this work, we present
Reference-Grounded Skill Discovery (RGSD), a novel algorithm that grounds skill
discovery in a semantically meaningful latent space using reference data. RGSD
first performs contrastive pretraining to embed motions on a unit hypersphere,
clustering each reference trajectory into a distinct direction. This grounding
enables skill discovery to simultaneously involve both imitation of reference
behaviors and the discovery of semantically related diverse behaviors. On a
simulated SMPL humanoid with 359-D observations and 69-D actions, RGSD learns
structured skills including walking, running, punching, and side stepping, and
also discovers related novel behaviors. In downstream control tasks, RGSD
outperforms imitation-based skill acquisition baselines. Our results suggest
that lightweight reference-guided grounding offers a practical path to
discovering semantically rich and structured skills in high-DoF systems.

*Albert Catalan-Tatjer,Niccolò Ajroldi,Jonas Geiping*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文通过分析大规模语言模型训练轨迹，发现量化误差主要由学习率与其他训练超参数的复杂相互作用驱动，而非训练数据规模。研究表明通过策略性调整训练超参数可以在大规模训练中改善量化质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管后训练量化被广泛用于大型语言模型的高效部署，但量化鲁棒性的内在机制仍不清楚。研究者希望准确评估训练动态与量化性能之间的关系。

Method: 对开源语言模型训练轨迹进行综合分析（最高32B参数和15T训练token），并在受控实验中训练自己的模型（最高100B token），研究训练动态干预措施。

Result: 关键发现是量化误差主要由学习率与其他训练超参数的复杂相互作用驱动。一旦学习率衰减，验证损失和量化误差就会发散，这与训练数据规模基本无关。

Conclusion: 研究结果挑战了增加数据集规模会固有地损害量化效果的假设，证明策略性的训练超参数干预可以在大规模训练中改善量化质量。

Abstract: While post-training quantization is widely adopted for efficient deployment
of large language models, the mechanisms underlying quantization robustness
remain unclear. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of quantization degradation
across open-source language model training trajectories up to 32B parameters
and 15T training tokens to accurately assess the relationship between training
dynamics and quantization performance. Our key finding is that quantization
errors in large-scale training runs are driven by a complex interplay between
learning rate and other training hyperparameters. Specifically, once learning
rates decay, validation loss and quantization error diverge, largely
independent of training data scale. To investigate interventions on the
training dynamics and identify specific configurations that can modulate
quantization robustness favorably, we train our own models in controlled
experiments up to 100B tokens. Our results challenge the assumption that
increasing dataset scale inherently compromises quantization effectiveness,
demonstrating instead that strategic training hyperparameter interventions can
improve quantization quality at scale.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Stratified GRPO方法，通过分层优势归一化解决LLM搜索代理中轨迹结构异质性导致的跨层偏差问题，显著提升训练效果和稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM代理在解决复杂多步问题时依赖外部工具，但搜索代理的轨迹结构异质性导致标准策略梯度方法存在跨层偏差，扭曲信用分配并阻碍复杂搜索策略的探索。

Method: 提出Stratified GRPO方法，核心是分层优势归一化(SAN)，根据轨迹结构特性将其划分为同质层，在每层内局部计算优势值，确保轨迹只与同类轨迹比较。

Result: 在多种单跳和多跳问答基准测试中，Stratified GRPO比GRPO性能提升高达11.3分，获得更高的训练奖励、更好的训练稳定性和更有效的搜索策略。

Conclusion: 分层是解决LLM搜索代理中结构异质性问题的原则性方法，SAN消除了跨层偏差，提供了更纯净和尺度稳定的学习信号。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents increasingly rely on external tools such as
search engines to solve complex, multi-step problems, and reinforcement
learning (RL) has become a key paradigm for training them. However, the
trajectories of search agents are structurally heterogeneous, where variations
in the number, placement, and outcomes of search calls lead to fundamentally
different answer directions and reward distributions. Standard policy gradient
methods, which use a single global baseline, suffer from what we identify and
formalize as cross-stratum bias-an "apples-to-oranges" comparison of
heterogeneous trajectories. This cross-stratum bias distorts credit assignment
and hinders exploration of complex, multi-step search strategies. To address
this, we propose Stratified GRPO, whose central component, Stratified Advantage
Normalization (SAN), partitions trajectories into homogeneous strata based on
their structural properties and computes advantages locally within each
stratum. This ensures that trajectories are evaluated only against their true
peers. Our analysis proves that SAN eliminates cross-stratum bias, yields
conditionally unbiased unit-variance estimates inside each stratum, and retains
the global unbiasedness and unit-variance properties enjoyed by standard
normalization, resulting in a more pure and scale-stable learning signal. To
improve practical stability under finite-sample regimes, we further linearly
blend SAN with the global estimator. Extensive experiments on diverse
single-hop and multi-hop question-answering benchmarks demonstrate that
Stratified GRPO consistently and substantially outperforms GRPO by up to 11.3
points, achieving higher training rewards, greater training stability, and more
effective search policies. These results establish stratification as a
principled remedy for structural heterogeneity in RL for LLM search agents.
