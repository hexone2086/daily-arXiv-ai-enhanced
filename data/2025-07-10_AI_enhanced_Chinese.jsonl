Above all, to develop a\nperception model for underwater images that more aligns with human visual\nperception, the visual semantic feature extraction capability of the CLIP model\nis leveraged to learn an appropriate prompt pair to map and evaluate the\nquality of underwater images. This CLIP perception model is then incorporated\nas a perception loss module into the enhancement network to improve the\nperceptual quality of enhanced images. Furthermore, the CLIP perception model\nis integrated with the curriculum contrastive regularization to enhance the\nconstraints imposed on the enhanced images within the CLIP perceptual space,\nmitigating the risk of both under-enhancement and over-enhancement.\nSpecifically, the CLIP perception model is employed to assess and categorize\nthe learning difficulty level of negatives in the regularization process,\nensuring comprehensive and nuanced utilization of distorted images and\nnegatives with varied quality levels.

Hosseini"], "title": "SPARC: Concept-Aligned Sparse Autoencoders for Cross-Model and Cross-Modal Interpretability", "comment": null, "summary": "Understanding how different AI models encode the same high-level concepts,\nsuch as objects or attributes, remains challenging because each model typically\nproduces its own isolated representation. Existing interpretability methods\nlike Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) produce latent concepts individually for each\nmodel, resulting in incompatible concept spaces and limiting cross-model\ninterpretability. To address this, we introduce SPARC (Sparse Autoencoders for\nAligned Representation of Concepts), a new framework that learns a single,\nunified latent space shared across diverse architectures and modalities (e.g.,\nvision models like DINO, and multimodal models like CLIP). SPARC's alignment is\nenforced through two key innovations: (1) a Global TopK sparsity mechanism,\nensuring all input streams activate identical latent dimensions for a given\nconcept; and (2) a Cross-Reconstruction Loss, which explicitly encourages\nsemantic consistency between models. On Open Images, SPARC dramatically\nimproves concept alignment, achieving a Jaccard similarity of 0.80, more than\ntripling the alignment compared to previous methods. SPARC creates a shared\nsparse latent space where individual dimensions often correspond to similar\nhigh-level concepts across models and modalities, enabling direct comparison of\nhow different architectures represent identical concepts without requiring\nmanual alignment or model-specific analysis. As a consequence of this aligned\nrepresentation, SPARC also enables practical applications such as text-guided\nspatial localization in vision-only models and cross-model/cross-modal\nretrieval.

Adaptive DBS (aDBS) offers a\nclosed-loop alternative, using biomarkers such as beta-band oscillations to\ndynamically modulate stimulation. While reinforcement learning (RL) holds\npromise for personalized aDBS control, existing methods suffer from high sample\ncomplexity, unstable exploration in binary action spaces, and limited\ndeployability on resource-constrained hardware.\n  We propose SEA-DBS, a sample-efficient actor-critic framework that addresses\nthe core challenges of RL-based adaptive neurostimulation. SEA-DBS integrates a\npredictive reward model to reduce reliance on real-time feedback and employs\nGumbel Softmax-based exploration for stable, differentiable policy updates in\nbinary action spaces.

The typical approach is useful to compare learning\nalgorithms but provides limited insight into the effects of different training\nregimens and little understanding about the richness and complexity of learned\nbehaviors. Likewise, human infants and other animals are \"trained\" via\nunsystematic regimens, but in contrast, developmental psychologists evaluate\ntheir performance in highly-controlled experiments with fine-grained measures\nsuch as success, speed of walking, and prospective adjustments. However, the\nstudy of learned behavior in human infants is limited by the practical\nconstraints of training and testing babies. Here, we present a case study that\napplies methods from developmental psychology to study the learned behavior of\nthe simulated bipedal robot Cassie. Following research on infant walking, we\nsystematically designed reinforcement learning training regimens and tested the\nresulting controllers in simulated environments analogous to those used for\nbabies--but without the practical constraints. Results reveal new insights into\nthe behavioral impact of different training regimens and the development of\nCassie's learned behaviors relative to infants who are learning to walk.

K mirrors the Neural Tangent Kernel in\nfeed-forward neural networks, while P appears in Lyapunov stability and optimal\ncontrol theory. We demonstrate two applications of our decomposition. First, we\nshow how their interplay gives rise to low-dimensional latent dynamics under\nGD, and, specifically, how the collapse is a result of the network structure,\nover and above the nature of the underlying task. Second, for multi-task\ntraining, we show that the operators can be used to measure how objectives\nrelevant to individual sub-tasks align.

To address this, we present Video-RTS, a\nnew approach to improve video reasoning capability with drastically improved\ndata efficiency by combining data-efficient RL with a video-adaptive test-time\nscaling (TTS) strategy. Based on observations about the data scaling of RL\nsamples, we skip the resource-intensive SFT step and employ efficient pure-RL\ntraining with output-based rewards, requiring no additional annotations or\nextensive fine-tuning. Furthermore, to utilize computational resources more\nefficiently, we introduce a sparse-to-dense video TTS strategy that improves\ninference by iteratively adding frames based on output consistency. We validate\nour approach on multiple video reasoning benchmarks, showing that Video-RTS\nsurpasses existing video reasoning models by an average of 2.4% in accuracy\nusing only 3.6% training samples. For example, Video-RTS achieves a 4.2%\nimprovement on Video-Holmes, a recent and challenging video reasoning\nbenchmark, and a 2.6% improvement on MMVU.

In this paper, we introduce and analyze a parameterized\ngeneral safety model that bridges the gap between physical and perceived safety\nby incorporating a personalization parameter, $\\rho$, into the safety\nmeasurement framework to account for individual differences in safety\nperception. Through a series of hypothesis-driven human-subject studies in a\nsimulated rescue scenario, we investigate how emotional state, trust, and robot\nbehavior influence perceived safety. Our results show that $\\rho$ effectively\ncaptures meaningful individual differences, driven by affective responses,\ntrust in task consistency, and clustering into distinct user types.\nSpecifically, our findings confirm that predictable and consistent robot\nbehavior as well as the elicitation of positive emotional states, significantly\nenhance perceived safety. Moreover, responses cluster into a small number of\nuser types, supporting adaptive personalization based on shared safety models.\nNotably, participant role significantly shapes safety perception, and repeated\nexposure reduces perceived safety for participants in the casualty role,\nemphasizing the impact of physical interaction and experiential change.

To enhance the advantage of Adam and\nmitigate its limitation, we propose SignSoftSGD (S3), a novel optimizer with\nthree key innovations. \\emph{First}, S3 generalizes the sign-like update by\nemploying a flexible $p$-th order momentum ($p \\geq 1$) in the denominator,\ndeparting from the conventional second-order momentum (variance)\npreconditioning. This design enables enhanced performance while achieving\nstable training even with aggressive learning rates. \\emph{Second}, S3\nminimizes the occurrences of loss spikes through unified exponential moving\naverage coefficients for numerator and denominator momenta, which inherently\nbound updates to $[-1, 1]$ and simplify hyperparameter tuning. \\emph{Third}, S3\nincorporates an equivalent Nesterov's accelerated gradient(NAG) module,\naccelerating convergence without memory overhead.

Although most past research has\nfocused on turning sign language into text, doing the reverse, turning spoken\nEnglish into sign language animations, has been largely overlooked.

In this\nwork, we introduce a complete pipeline that converts English speech into\nsmooth, realistic 3D sign language animations. Our system starts with Whisper\nto translate spoken English into text. Then, we use a MarianMT machine\ntranslation model to translate that text into American Sign Language (ASL)\ngloss, a simplified version of sign language that captures meaning without\ngrammar. This model performs well, reaching BLEU scores of 0.7714 and 0.8923.\nTo make the gloss translation more accurate, we also use word embeddings such\nas Word2Vec and FastText to understand word meanings. Finally, we animate the\ntranslated gloss using a 3D keypoint-based motion system trained on\nSign3D-WLASL, a dataset we created by extracting body, hand, and face key\npoints from real ASL videos in the WLASL dataset. To support the gloss\ntranslation stage, we also built a new dataset called BookGlossCorpus-CG, which\nturns everyday English sentences from the BookCorpus dataset into ASL gloss\nusing grammar rules. Our system stitches everything together by smoothly\ninterpolating between signs to create natural, continuous animations. Unlike\nprevious works like How2Sign and Phoenix-2014T that focus on recognition or use\nonly one type of data, our pipeline brings together audio, text, and motion in\na single framework that goes all the way from spoken English to lifelike 3D\nsign language animation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5c06\u82f1\u8bed\u8bed\u97f3\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u6d41\u7545\u76843D\u624b\u8bed\u52a8\u753b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8bed\u97f3\u8bc6\u522b\u3001\u6587\u672c\u7ffb\u8bd1\u548c\u52a8\u4f5c\u751f\u6210\u6280\u672f\u3002", "motivation": "\u5e2e\u52a9\u804b\u4eba\u548c\u542c\u529b\u969c\u788d\u8005\u66f4\u8f7b\u677e\u5730\u6c9f\u901a\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u4ece\u8bed\u97f3\u5230\u624b\u8bed\u52a8\u753b\u8f6c\u6362\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528Whisper\u8fdb\u884c\u8bed\u97f3\u8f6c\u6587\u672c\uff0cMarianMT\u6a21\u578b\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4e3aASL gloss\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408Word2Vec\u548cFastText\u4f18\u5316\u7ffb\u8bd1\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc73D\u5173\u952e\u70b9\u7cfb\u7edf\u751f\u6210\u52a8\u753b\u3002", "result": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0cBLEU\u5206\u6570\u8fbe0.7714\u548c0.8923\uff0c\u5e76\u521b\u5efa\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6Sign3D-WLASL\u548cBookGlossCorpus-CG\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u6574\u5408\u4e86\u97f3\u9891\u3001\u6587\u672c\u548c\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4ece\u82f1\u8bed\u8bed\u97f3\u5230\u903c\u771f3D\u624b\u8bed\u52a8\u753b\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u8f6c\u6362\u3002"}}

Self-play (SP) algorithms try to\nharness these dynamics by pitting agents against ever-improving opponents,\nthereby creating an implicit curriculum toward learning high-quality solutions.\nHowever, SP often fails to produce diverse solutions and can get stuck in\nlocally optimal behaviors. We introduce Foundation-Model Self-Play (FMSP), a\nnew direction that leverages the code-generation capabilities and vast\nknowledge of foundation models (FMs) to overcome these challenges by leaping\nacross local optima in policy space. We propose a family of approaches: (1)\n\\textbf{Vanilla Foundation-Model Self-Play (vFMSP)} continually refines agent\npolicies via competitive self-play; (2) \\textbf{Novelty-Search Self-Play\n(NSSP)} builds a diverse population of strategies, ignoring performance; and\n(3) the most promising variant, \\textbf{Quality-Diveristy Self-Play (QDSP)},\ncreates a diverse set of high-quality policies by combining the diversity of\nNSSP and refinement of vFMSP. We evaluate FMSPs in Car Tag, a\ncontinuous-control pursuer-evader setting, and in Gandalf, a simple AI safety\nsimulation in which an attacker tries to jailbreak an LLM's defenses. In Car\nTag, FMSPs explore a wide variety of reinforcement learning, tree search, and\nheuristic-based methods, to name just a few.

Most advanced methods model agent interactions by efficiently\nfactorized attention based on the temporal and agent axes. However, this static\nand foward modeling lacks explicit interactive spatio-temporal coordination,\ncapturing only obvious and immediate behavioral intentions. Alternatively, the\nmodern trajectory prediction framework refines the successive predictions by a\nfixed-anchor selection strategy, which is difficult to adapt in different\nfuture environments. It is acknowledged that human drivers dynamically adjust\ninitial driving decisions based on further assumptions about the intentions of\nsurrounding vehicles. Motivated by human driving behaviors, this paper proposes\nILNet, a multi-agent trajectory prediction method with Inverse Learning (IL)\nattention and Dynamic Anchor Selection (DAS) module. IL Attention employs an\ninverse learning paradigm to model interactions at neighboring moments,\nintroducing proposed intentions to dynamically encode the spatio-temporal\ncoordination of interactions, thereby enhancing the model's ability to capture\ncomplex interaction patterns. Then, the learnable DAS module is proposed to\nextract multiple trajectory change keypoints as anchors in parallel with almost\nno increase in parameters. Experimental results show that the ILNet achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on the INTERACTION and Argoverse motion\nforecasting datasets.

In this\npaper, we first introduce powerful diffusion models into the federated learning\nparadigm and show that diffusion representations are effective steers during\nfederated training. To explore the possibility of using diffusion\nrepresentations in handling data heterogeneity, we propose a novel\ndiffusion-inspired Federated paradigm with Diffusion Representation\nCollaboration, termed FedDifRC, leveraging meaningful guidance of diffusion\nmodels to mitigate data heterogeneity. The key idea is to construct text-driven\ndiffusion contrasting and noise-driven diffusion regularization, aiming to\nprovide abundant class-related semantic information and consistent convergence\nsignals. On the one hand, we exploit the conditional feedback from the\ndiffusion model for different text prompts to build a text-driven contrastive\nlearning strategy. On the other hand, we introduce a noise-driven consistency\nregularization to align local instances with diffusion denoising\nrepresentations, constraining the optimization region in the feature space. In\naddition, FedDifRC can be extended to a self-supervised scheme without relying\non any labeled data.

With the remarkable advancements in Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs), the adoption of LLMs as the foundational architecture\nfor time series modeling has gained significant attention. Although existing\nmodels achieve some success, they rarely both model time and frequency\ncharacteristics in a pretraining-finetuning paradigm leading to suboptimal\nperformance in predictions of complex time series, which requires both modeling\nperiodicity and prior pattern knowledge of signals. We propose MoFE-Time, an\ninnovative time series forecasting model that integrates time and frequency\ndomain features within a Mixture of Experts (MoE) network. Moreover, we use the\npretraining-finetuning paradigm as our training framework to effectively\ntransfer prior pattern knowledge across pretraining and finetuning datasets\nwith different periodicity distributions. Our method introduces both frequency\nand time cells as experts after attention modules and leverages the MoE routing\nmechanism to construct multidimensional sparse representations of input\nsignals.

Most existing methods use equally\npenalized objectives, which ignore the per-point ambiguities and less\ndiscriminated features stemming from transition regions. However, as highly\nambiguous points may be indistinguishable even for humans, their manually\nannotated labels are less reliable, and hard constraints over these points\nwould lead to sub-optimal models. To address this, we first design\nAMContrast3D, a method comprising contrastive learning into an ambiguity\nestimation framework, tailored to adaptive objectives for individual points\nbased on ambiguity levels. As a result, our method promotes model training,\nwhich ensures the correctness of low-ambiguity points while allowing mistakes\nfor high-ambiguity points. As ambiguities are formulated based on position\ndiscrepancies across labels, optimization during inference is constrained by\nthe assumption that all unlabeled points are uniformly unambiguous, lacking\nambiguity awareness. Inspired by the insight of joint training, we further\npropose AMContrast3D++ integrating with two branches trained in parallel, where\na novel ambiguity prediction module concurrently learns point ambiguities from\ngenerated embeddings. To this end, we design a masked refinement mechanism that\nleverages predicted ambiguities to enable the ambiguous embeddings to be more\nreliable, thereby boosting segmentation performance and enhancing robustness.\nExperimental results on 3D indoor scene datasets, S3DIS and ScanNet,\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Existing projection-based\nmethods leverage view-independent projection in complex scenes, relying on\nstraight lines to generate direct rays or upward curves to reduce occlusions.\nHowever, their view independence provides projection rays that are limited to\npre-defined parameters by human settings, restricting point awareness and\nfailing to capture sufficient projection diversity across different view\nplanes. Although multiple projections per view plane are commonly used to\nenhance spatial variety, the projected redundancy leads to excessive\ncomputational overhead and inefficiency in image processing. To address these\nlimitations, we design a framework of VDP to generate data-driven projections\nfrom 3D point distributions, producing highly informative single-image inputs\nby predicting rays inspired by the adaptive behavior of fireworks.

Prominent methods typically frame the restoration\nproblem within a Bayesian inference framework, which iteratively combines a\ndenoising step with a likelihood guidance step.

In\nthis paper, we analyze the underlying gradient dynamics of these components and\nidentify significant instabilities.

As these\nsystems evolve rapidly, it becomes increasingly important to reliably predict\ntheir states in the short term to ensure operational stability, support control\ndecisions, and enable interpretable monitoring of sensor and machine behavior.\nModern power systems often span multiple physical domains - including\nelectrical, mechanical, hydraulic, and thermal - posing significant challenges\nfor modeling and prediction. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a\npromising data-driven framework for system state estimation and state\nforecasting in such settings. By leveraging the topological structure of sensor\nnetworks, GNNs can implicitly learn inter-sensor relationships and propagate\ninformation across the network. However, most existing GNN-based methods are\ndesigned under the assumption of homogeneous sensor relationships and are\ntypically constrained to a single physical domain. This limitation restricts\ntheir ability to integrate and reason over heterogeneous sensor data commonly\nencountered in real-world energy systems, such as those used in energy\nconversion infrastructure. In this work, we propose the use of Heterogeneous\nGraph Attention Networks to address these limitations.

By incorporating prompt-derived semantic cues,\nPCA enables more adaptive and informed reuse decisions than conventional\ncaching methods. We also revisit the assumptions behind TeaCache and identify a\nkey limitation: it suffers from poor input-output relationship modeling due to\nan oversimplified prior. To overcome this, we decouple the noisy input, enhance\nthe contribution of meaningful textual information, and improve the model's\npredictive accuracy through multivariate polynomial feature expansion. To\nfurther reduce computational cost, we replace the static CFGCache with\nDynCFGCache, a dynamic mechanism that selectively reuses classifier-free\nguidance (CFG) outputs based on estimated output variations.

Since\ndifferent discrete emotions may exist at the same time, compared with\nsingle-class emotion recognition, emotion distribution learning (EDL) that\nidentifies a mixture of basic emotions has gradually emerged as a trend.\nHowever, existing EDL methods face challenges in mining the heterogeneity among\nmultiple modalities. Besides, rich semantic correlations across arbitrary basic\nemotions are not fully exploited. In this paper, we propose a multi-modal\nemotion distribution learning framework, named HeLo, aimed at fully exploring\nthe heterogeneity and complementary information in multi-modal emotional data\nand label correlation within mixed basic emotions. Specifically, we first adopt\ncross-attention to effectively fuse the physiological data. Then, an optimal\ntransport (OT)-based heterogeneity mining module is devised to mine the\ninteraction and heterogeneity between the physiological and behavioral\nrepresentations. To facilitate label correlation learning, we introduce a\nlearnable label embedding optimized by correlation matrix alignment. Finally,\nthe learnable label embeddings and label correlation matrices are integrated\nwith the multi-modal representations through a novel label correlation-driven\ncross-attention mechanism for accurate emotion distribution learning.\nExperimental results on two publicly available datasets demonstrate the\nsuperiority of our proposed method in emotion distribution learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aHeLo\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u5e03\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u548c\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\u65b9\u6cd5\u6316\u6398\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6807\u7b7e\u5d4c\u5165\u4f18\u5316\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u5e03\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u60c5\u611f\u8bc6\u522b\u5728HCI\u4e2d\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6316\u6398\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u548c\u60c5\u611f\u6807\u7b7e\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u8de8\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u878d\u5408\u751f\u7406\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u57fa\u4e8e\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\u7684\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u6316\u6398\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6807\u7b7e\u5d4c\u5165\u548c\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u77e9\u9635\u5bf9\u9f50\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "HeLo\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u5e03\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

The HV color map enforces small distances\nfor the red coordinates to remove red noise artifacts, while the learnable\nintensity compresses the low-light regions to remove black noise artifacts.\nAdditionally, we introduce the Color and Intensity Decoupling Network+\n(HVI-CIDNet+), built upon the HVI color space, to restore damaged content and\nmitigate color distortion in extremely dark regions. Specifically, HVI-CIDNet+\nleverages abundant contextual and degraded knowledge extracted from low-light\nimages using pre-trained vision-language models, integrated via a novel\nPrior-guided Attention Block (PAB). Within the PAB, latent semantic priors can\npromote content restoration, while degraded representations guide precise color\ncorrection, both particularly in extremely dark regions through the\nmeticulously designed cross-attention fusion mechanism. Furthermore, we\nconstruct a Region Refinement Block that employs convolution for\ninformation-rich regions and self-attention for information-scarce regions,\nensuring accurate brightness adjustments. Comprehensive results from benchmark\nexperiments demonstrate that the proposed HVI-CIDNet+ outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art methods on 10 datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684HVI\u989c\u8272\u7a7a\u95f4\u548cHVI-CIDNet+\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4f4e\u5149\u56fe\u50cf\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u989c\u8272\u504f\u5dee\u548c\u4eae\u5ea6\u4f2a\u5f71\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8esRGB\u548cHSV\u989c\u8272\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u4f4e\u5149\u56fe\u50cf\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u989c\u8272\u504f\u5dee\u548c\u4eae\u5ea6\u4f2a\u5f71\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faHVI\u989c\u8272\u7a7a\u95f4\uff08\u7ed3\u5408HV\u989c\u8272\u56fe\u548c\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u5f3a\u5ea6\uff09\u548cHVI-CIDNet+\u7f51\u7edc\uff08\u5229\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548cPrior-guided Attention Block\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u572810\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "HVI-CIDNet+\u901a\u8fc7\u65b0\u989c\u8272\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u7f51\u7edc\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4f4e\u5149\u56fe\u50cf\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

In this paper, we introduce IAP, a novel attack\nframework that generates highly invisible adversarial patches based on\nperceptibility-aware localization and perturbation optimization schemes.\nSpecifically, IAP first searches for a proper location to place the patch by\nleveraging classwise localization and sensitivity maps, balancing the\nsusceptibility of patch location to both victim model prediction and human\nvisual system, then employs a perceptibility-regularized adversarial loss and a\ngradient update rule that prioritizes color constancy for optimizing invisible\nperturbations. Comprehensive experiments across various image benchmarks and\nmodel architectures demonstrate that IAP consistently achieves competitive\nattack success rates in targeted settings with significantly improved patch\ninvisibility compared to existing baselines.

Project page:\n  https://anitaleungxx.github.io/ReMix", "summary": "Reinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated its potential to improve the\nreasoning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs). One major limitation of most\nexisting Reinforcement Finetuning (RFT) methods is that they are on-policy RL\nin nature, i.e., data generated during the past learning process is not fully\nutilized. This inevitably comes at a significant cost of compute and time,\nposing a stringent bottleneck on continuing economic and efficient scaling. To\nthis end, we launch the renaissance of off-policy RL and propose Reincarnating\nMix-policy Proximal Policy Gradient (ReMix), a general approach to enable\non-policy RFT methods like PPO and GRPO to leverage off-policy data. ReMix\nconsists of three major components: (1) Mix-policy proximal policy gradient\nwith an increased Update-To-Data (UTD) ratio for efficient training; (2)\nKL-Convex policy constraint to balance the trade-off between stability and\nflexibility; (3) Policy reincarnation to achieve a seamless transition from\nefficient early-stage learning to steady asymptotic improvement. In our\nexperiments, we train a series of ReMix models upon PPO, GRPO and 1.5B, 7B base\nmodels. ReMix shows an average Pass@1 accuracy of 52.10% (for 1.5B model) with\n0.079M response rollouts, 350 training steps and achieves 63.27%/64.39% (for 7B\nmodel) with 0.007M/0.011M response rollouts, 50/75 training steps, on five math\nreasoning benchmarks (i.e., AIME'24, AMC'23, Minerva, OlympiadBench, and\nMATH500). Compared with 15 recent advanced models, ReMix shows SOTA-level\nperformance with an over 30x to 450x reduction in training cost in terms of\nrollout data volume.

Our APL can\neasily be incorporated into different GCD frameworks by replacing their CLS\ntoken feature with our part representations, showing significant enhancements\non fine-grained datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u90e8\u5206\u53d1\u73b0\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08APL\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5171\u4eab\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u90e8\u5206\u67e5\u8be2\u548cDINO\u90e8\u5206\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u5bf9\u8c61\u90e8\u5206\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u6807\u6ce8\u3002APL\u901a\u8fc7\u65b0\u9896\u7684all-min\u5bf9\u6bd4\u635f\u5931\u5b66\u4e60\u5177\u6709\u533a\u5206\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86GCD\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709GCD\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u89c6\u89c9\u53d8\u6362\u5668\uff08\u5982DINO\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u4f46\u4ec5\u5173\u6ce8\u5168\u5c40\u8868\u793a\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u533a\u5206\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAPL\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5171\u4eab\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u90e8\u5206\u67e5\u8be2\u548cDINO\u90e8\u5206\u5148\u9a8c\u751f\u6210\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u5bf9\u8c61\u90e8\u5206\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1all-min\u5bf9\u6bd4\u635f\u5931\u5b66\u4e60\u533a\u5206\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u517c\u5177\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u8868\u793a\u3002", "result": "APL\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86GCD\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "APL\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u90e8\u5206\u53d1\u73b0\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86GCD\u4e2d\u533a\u5206\u6027\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u7684\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Furthermore, existing calligraphic datasets are extremely scarce,\nand most provide only character-level annotations without additional attribute\ninformation. This limitation has significantly hindered the in-depth study of\nChinese calligraphy. To fill this gap, we present a novel Multi-Attribute\nChinese Calligraphy Character Dataset (MCCD). The dataset encompasses 7,765\ncategories with a total of 329,715 isolated image samples of Chinese\ncalligraphy characters, and three additional subsets were extracted based on\nthe attribute labeling of the three types of script styles (10 types),\ndynasties (15 periods) and calligraphers (142 individuals).

In this work we propose a new\napproach to investigate archaeological areas of influence based on vegetation\nsignatures. It consists of a deep learning model trained on satellite imagery\nto identify palm trees, followed by a clustering algorithm to identify palm\nclusters, which are then used to estimate ancient management areas. To assess\nthe palm distribution in relation to past human activity, we applied the\nproposed approach to unique high-resolution satellite imagery data covering 765\nkm2 of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta, Colombia. With this work, we also\nrelease a manually annotated palm tree dataset along with estimated locations\nof archaeological sites from ground-surveys and legacy records. Results\ndemonstrate how palms were significantly more abundant near archaeological\nsites showing large infrastructure investment. The extent of the largest palm\ncluster indicates that ancient human-managed areas linked to major\ninfrastructure sites may be up to two orders of magnitude bigger than indicated\nby archaeological evidence alone.

This study trained and evaluated a deep learning DIR method for\ndomain invariant MR-MR registration. Methods: A progressively refined\nregistration and segmentation (ProRSeg) method was trained with 262 pairs of 3T\nMR simulation scans from prostate cancer patients using weighted segmentation\nconsistency loss. ProRSeg was tested on same- (58 pairs), cross- (72 1.5T MR\nLinac pairs), and mixed-domain (42 MRSim-MRL pairs) datasets for contour\npropagation accuracy of clinical target volume (CTV), bladder, and rectum. Dose\naccumulation was performed for 42 patients undergoing 5-fraction MRgART.\nResults: ProRSeg demonstrated generalization for bladder with similar Dice\nSimilarity Coefficients across domains (0.88, 0.87, 0.86). For rectum and CTV,\nperformance was domain-dependent with higher accuracy on cross-domain MRL\ndataset (DSCs 0.89) versus same-domain data. The model's strong cross-domain\nperformance prompted us to study the feasibility of using it for dose\naccumulation.

Yet, their effectiveness\nin practical applications is compromised by domain shifts and distributional\nchanges, especially when test data distributions diverge from training data.\nTherefore, the paradigm of test-time adaptation (TTA) has emerged, enabling the\nuse of online off-the-shelf data at test time, supporting independent sample\npredictions, and eliminating reliance on test annotations. Traditional TTA\nmethods, however, often rely on costly training or optimization processes, or\nmake unrealistic assumptions about accessing or storing historical training and\ntest data. Instead, this study proposes FreeTTA, a training-free and\nuniversally available method that makes no assumptions, to enhance the\nflexibility of TTA.

We introduce RulerNet, a deep learning framework that robustly\ninfers scale \"in the wild\" by reformulating ruler reading as a unified\nkeypoint-detection problem and by representing the ruler with\ngeometric-progression parameters that are invariant to perspective\ntransformations. Unlike traditional methods that rely on handcrafted thresholds\nor rigid, ruler-specific pipelines, RulerNet directly localizes centimeter\nmarks using a distortion-invariant annotation and training strategy, enabling\nstrong generalization across diverse ruler types and imaging conditions while\nmitigating data scarcity. We also present a scalable synthetic-data pipeline\nthat combines graphics-based ruler generation with ControlNet to add\nphotorealistic context, greatly increasing training diversity and improving\nperformance. To further enhance robustness and efficiency, we propose DeepGP, a\nlightweight feed-forward network that regresses geometric-progression\nparameters from noisy marks and eliminates iterative optimization, enabling\nreal-time scale estimation on mobile or edge devices.

However, a key limitation is the\nuse of CLIP as the visual encoder; while it can capture coarse global\ninformation, it often can miss fine-grained details that are relevant to the\ninput query. To address these shortcomings, this work studies whether\npre-trained text-to-image diffusion models can serve as instruction-aware\nvisual encoders. Through an analysis of their internal representations, we find\ndiffusion features are both rich in semantics and can encode strong image-text\nalignment. Moreover, we find that we can leverage text conditioning to focus\nthe model on regions relevant to the input question. We then investigate how to\nalign these features with large language models and uncover a leakage\nphenomenon, where the LLM can inadvertently recover information from the\noriginal diffusion prompt. We analyze the causes of this leakage and propose a\nmitigation strategy. Based on these insights, we explore a simple fusion\nstrategy that utilizes both CLIP and conditional diffusion features. We\nevaluate our approach on both general VQA and specialized MLLM benchmarks,\ndemonstrating the promise of diffusion models for visual understanding,\nparticularly in vision-centric tasks that require spatial and compositional\nreasoning.
