### [1] [Hybrid Deep Learning for Hyperspectral Single Image Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00033)
*Usman Muhammad,Jorma Laaksonen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出SSUF模块和空间-光谱梯度损失函数，用于提升高光谱单图像超分辨率的空间细节和光谱保真度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度学习模型在高光谱超分辨率任务中难以同时恢复精细空间细节和保持宽波长范围内的光谱保真度

Method: 提出SSUF模块，结合光谱解混和光谱-空间特征提取，集成到标准2D卷积架构中；设计空间-光谱梯度损失函数，结合MSE与空间和光谱梯度分量

Result: 在三个公共遥感高光谱数据集上的实验表明，所提出的混合深度学习模型在降低模型复杂度的同时实现了有竞争力的性能

Conclusion: SSUF模块和空间-光谱梯度损失函数有效提升了高光谱超分辨率的性能，同时减少了模型复杂度

Abstract: Hyperspectral single image super-resolution (SISR) is a challenging task due
to the difficulty of restoring fine spatial details while preserving spectral
fidelity across a wide range of wavelengths, which limits the performance of
conventional deep learning models. To address this challenge, we introduce
Spectral-Spatial Unmixing Fusion (SSUF), a novel module that can be seamlessly
integrated into standard 2D convolutional architectures to enhance both spatial
resolution and spectral integrity. The SSUF combines spectral unmixing with
spectral--spatial feature extraction and guides a ResNet-based convolutional
neural network for improved reconstruction. In addition, we propose a custom
Spatial-Spectral Gradient Loss function that integrates mean squared error with
spatial and spectral gradient components, encouraging accurate reconstruction
of both spatial and spectral features. Experiments on three public remote
sensing hyperspectral datasets demonstrate that the proposed hybrid deep
learning model achieves competitive performance while reducing model
complexity.

### [2] [Review of Hallucination Understanding in Large Language and Vision Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00034)
*Zhengyi Ho,Siyuan Liang,Dacheng Tao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个统一的多层次框架来表征图像和文本幻觉，通过任务-模态交织方法将幻觉与模型生命周期中的特定机制联系起来，揭示了幻觉源于数据分布和继承偏见的可预测模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模语言和视觉模型在现实应用中的广泛采用使得解决幻觉问题变得紧迫，这些错误可能在部署过程中传播错误信息，造成财务和运营损害。当前对幻觉的理解不完整且碎片化，需要统一框架来开发更有效的解决方案。

Method: 提出了统一的多层次框架来表征图像和文本幻觉，采用任务-模态交织方法将幻觉与模型生命周期中的特定机制联系起来。

Result: 研究发现幻觉往往源于数据分布的可预测模式和继承偏见，这为理解幻觉提供了新的视角。

Conclusion: 通过深化对幻觉的理解，这项调查为在现实世界生成式AI系统中开发更鲁棒和有效的幻觉解决方案奠定了基础。

Abstract: The widespread adoption of large language and vision models in real-world
applications has made urgent the need to address hallucinations -- instances
where models produce incorrect or nonsensical outputs. These errors can
propagate misinformation during deployment, leading to both financial and
operational harm. Although much research has been devoted to mitigating
hallucinations, our understanding of it is still incomplete and fragmented.
Without a coherent understanding of hallucinations, proposed solutions risk
mitigating surface symptoms rather than underlying causes, limiting their
effectiveness and generalizability in deployment. To tackle this gap, we first
present a unified, multi-level framework for characterizing both image and text
hallucinations across diverse applications, aiming to reduce conceptual
fragmentation. We then link these hallucinations to specific mechanisms within
a model's lifecycle, using a task-modality interleaved approach to promote a
more integrated understanding. Our investigations reveal that hallucinations
often stem from predictable patterns in data distributions and inherited
biases. By deepening our understanding, this survey provides a foundation for
developing more robust and effective solutions to hallucinations in real-world
generative AI systems.

### [3] [On Robustness of Vision-Language-Action Model against Multi-Modal Perturbations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00037)
*Jianing Guo,Zhenhong Wu,Chang Tu,Yiyao Ma,Xiangqi Kong,Zhiqian Liu,Jiaming Ji,Shuning Zhang,Yuanpei Chen,Kai Chen,Xianglong Liu,Qi Dou,Yaodong Yang,Huijie Zhao,Weifeng Lv,Simin Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了RobustVLA方法，针对VLA模型在多模态扰动下的鲁棒性问题，通过离线鲁棒优化和输入一致性增强，显著提升了模型在动作、指令、环境和观察四种模态扰动下的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLA模型主要针对简单的视觉扰动，忽略了动作、指令、环境和观察等多模态扰动，需要开发能够应对多模态扰动的鲁棒VLA模型。

Method: 1) 输出鲁棒性：通过离线鲁棒优化对抗最坏情况的动作噪声；2) 输入鲁棒性：强制输入变化时保持动作一致性；3) 将鲁棒性建模为多臂老虎机问题，使用上置信界算法自动识别最有害的噪声。

Result: 在LIBERO基准测试中，RobustVLA相比基线在pi0骨干上提升12.6%，在OpenVLA骨干上提升10.4%，推理速度比现有视觉鲁棒VLA快50.6倍，在混合扰动下提升10.4%。在真实FR5机器人上，四模态扰动下提升65.6%。

Conclusion: RobustVLA通过多模态鲁棒性优化，显著提升了VLA模型在真实世界扰动下的性能，特别是在资源受限的真实机器人场景中表现突出。

Abstract: In Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, robustness to real-world
perturbations is critical for deployment. Existing methods target simple visual
disturbances, overlooking the broader multi-modal perturbations that arise in
actions, instructions, environments, and observations. Here, we first evaluate
the robustness of mainstream VLAs under 17 perturbations across four
modalities. We find (1) actions as the most fragile modality, (2) Existing
visual-robust VLA do not gain robustness in other modality, and (3) pi0
demonstrates superior robustness with a diffusion-based action head. To build
multi-modal robust VLAs, we propose RobustVLA against perturbations in VLA
inputs and outputs. For output robustness, we perform offline robust
optimization against worst-case action noise that maximizes mismatch in flow
matching objective. This can be seen as adversarial training, label smoothing,
and outlier penalization. For input robustness, we enforce consistent actions
across input variations that preserve task semantics. To account for multiple
perturbations, we formulate robustness as a multi-armed bandit problem and
apply an upper confidence bound algorithm to automatically identify the most
harmful noise. Experiments on LIBERO demonstrate our RobustVLA delivers
absolute gains over baselines of 12.6% on the pi0 backbone and 10.4% on the
OpenVLA backbone across all 17 perturbations, achieving 50.6x faster inference
than existing visual-robust VLAs, and a 10.4% gain under mixed perturbations.
Our RobustVLA is particularly effective on real-world FR5 robot with limited
demonstrations, showing absolute gains by 65.6% under perturbations of four
modalities.

### [4] [Uncovering Intrinsic Capabilities: A Paradigm for Data Curation in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00040)
*Junjie Li,Ziao Wang,Jianghong Ma,Xiaofeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CADC框架通过无监督发现内在能力、基于影响力估计的数据归因以及平衡选择和分阶段排序的能力感知课程，仅使用5%原始数据就能在多项基准测试中超越全数据训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有指令调优方法将模型视为黑盒，忽视了控制学习的内在能力，导致在减少训练数据预算时出现性能回归。

Method: 提出能力归因数据筛选框架：无监督发现内在能力，通过影响力估计将训练数据归因到这些能力，并通过平衡选择和分阶段排序构建能力感知课程。

Result: 仅使用5%原始数据，CADC在多项多模态基准测试中超越了全数据训练的性能。

Conclusion: 内在能力是模型学习的基本构建块，CADC为指令数据筛选建立了一个原则性范式，将黑盒指令调优转变为可控的能力驱动过程。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) achieve strong benchmark performance, but
controlling their behavior through instruction tuning remains difficult.
Reducing the budget of instruction tuning dataset often causes regressions, as
heuristic strategies treat models as black boxes and overlook the latent
capabilities that govern learning. We introduce Capability-Attributed Data
Curation (CADC), a framework that shifts curation from task-specific heuristics
to intrinsic capability analysis. CADC discovers intrinsic capabilities in an
unsupervised manner from gradient-based learning trajectories, attributes
training data to these capabilities via influence estimation, and curates
capability-aware curricula through balanced selection and staged sequencing.
This transforms black-box instruction tuning into a controllable,
capability-driven process. With as little as 5% of the original data, CADC
surpasses full-data training on multimodal benchmarks. These results validate
intrinsic capabilities as the fundamental building blocks of model learning and
establish CADC as a principle paradigm for instruction data curation.

### [5] [Culture In a Frame: C$^3$B as a Comic-Based Benchmark for Multimodal Culturally Awareness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00041)
*Yuchen Song,Andong Chen,Wenxin Zhu,Kehai Chen,Xuefeng Bai,Muyun Yang,Tiejun Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了C³B基准测试，这是一个多文化、多任务、多语言的文化意识能力基准，包含2000多张图像和18000多个问答对，用于评估多模态大语言模型的文化意识能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基准测试在任务设计上缺乏难度递进，缺少跨语言任务，且使用真实世界图像（通常只包含单一文化），使得测试相对容易。

Method: 构建了包含三个难度递进任务的基准：从基础视觉识别到高级文化冲突理解，再到文化内容生成。使用漫画图像构建多文化场景。

Result: 评估了11个开源MLLMs，发现MLLMs与人类表现之间存在显著性能差距，表明当前MLLMs在文化意识能力方面面临重大挑战。

Conclusion: C³B基准为MLLMs的文化意识能力提供了重要评估工具，鼓励未来研究推进MLLMs的文化意识能力发展。

Abstract: Cultural awareness capabilities has emerged as a critical capability for
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). However, current benchmarks lack
progressed difficulty in their task design and are deficient in cross-lingual
tasks. Moreover, current benchmarks often use real-world images. Each
real-world image typically contains one culture, making these benchmarks
relatively easy for MLLMs. Based on this, we propose C$^3$B ($\textbf{C}$omics
$\textbf{C}$ross-$\textbf{C}$ultural $\textbf{B}$enchmark), a novel
multicultural, multitask and multilingual cultural awareness capabilities
benchmark. C$^3$B comprises over 2000 images and over 18000 QA pairs,
constructed on three tasks with progressed difficulties, from basic visual
recognition to higher-level cultural conflict understanding, and finally to
cultural content generation. We conducted evaluations on 11 open-source MLLMs,
revealing a significant performance gap between MLLMs and human performance.
The gap demonstrates that C$^3$B poses substantial challenges for current
MLLMs, encouraging future research to advance the cultural awareness
capabilities of MLLMs.

### [6] [Beyond the Prompt: Gender Bias in Text-to-Image Models, with a Case Study on Hospital Professions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00045)
*Franck Vandewiele,Remi Synave,Samuel Delepoulle,Remi Cozot*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究分析了6个开源文本到图像模型在医疗职业描绘中的性别偏见，发现所有模型都存在系统性职业刻板印象，但不同模型对提示词的敏感度差异显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本到图像模型在专业、教育和创意领域应用日益广泛，但其输出经常嵌入和放大社会偏见，特别是性别刻板印象，需要系统评估。

Method: 使用6个先进开源模型，针对5种医院相关职业和5种肖像修饰词组合生成图像，每种组合生成100张图片，分析性别分布模式。

Result: 所有模型都表现出系统性职业刻板印象：护士被一致描绘为女性，外科医生主要为男性。不同模型偏差程度各异，Qwen-Image和SDXL男性主导最明显，FLUX.1-dev偏向女性，提示词修饰语显著影响性别平衡。

Conclusion: TTI模型中的性别偏见既系统又模型特定，提示词措辞在塑造人口统计结果中起关键作用，需要偏差感知设计、平衡默认设置和用户指导来防止职业刻板印象强化。

Abstract: Text-to-image (TTI) models are increasingly used in professional,
educational, and creative contexts, yet their outputs often embed and amplify
social biases. This paper investigates gender representation in six
state-of-the-art open-weight models: HunyuanImage 2.1, HiDream-I1-dev,
Qwen-Image, FLUX.1-dev, Stable-Diffusion 3.5 Large, and Stable-Diffusion-XL.
Using carefully designed prompts, we generated 100 images for each combination
of five hospital-related professions (cardiologist, hospital director, nurse,
paramedic, surgeon) and five portrait qualifiers ("", corporate, neutral,
aesthetic, beautiful).
  Our analysis reveals systematic occupational stereotypes: all models produced
nurses exclusively as women and surgeons predominantly as men. However,
differences emerge across models: Qwen-Image and SDXL enforce rigid male
dominance, HiDream-I1-dev shows mixed outcomes, and FLUX.1-dev skews female in
most roles. HunyuanImage 2.1 and Stable-Diffusion 3.5 Large also reproduce
gender stereotypes but with varying degrees of sensitivity to prompt
formulation. Portrait qualifiers further modulate gender balance, with terms
like corporate reinforcing male depictions and beautiful favoring female ones.
Sensitivity varies widely: Qwen-Image remains nearly unaffected, while
FLUX.1-dev, SDXL, and SD3.5 show strong prompt dependence.
  These findings demonstrate that gender bias in TTI models is both systematic
and model-specific. Beyond documenting disparities, we argue that prompt
wording plays a critical role in shaping demographic outcomes. The results
underscore the need for bias-aware design, balanced defaults, and user guidance
to prevent the reinforcement of occupational stereotypes in generative AI.

### [7] [Reinforcement Learning-Based Prompt Template Stealing for Text-to-Image Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00046)
*Xiaotian Zou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RLStealer是一种基于强化学习的提示词窃取框架，能够通过少量示例图像恢复文本到图像模型的提示模板，攻击成本仅为现有基线的13%，揭示了提示词交易中的安全风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示多模态大语言模型(MLLMs)提示词交易市场中存在的安全漏洞，即精心设计的提示词可能被盗用，这对商业应用构成严重威胁。

Method: 将模板窃取建模为序列决策问题，使用基于相似度的反馈信号作为奖励函数，通过强化学习有效探索提示空间。

Result: 在公开基准测试中达到最先进性能，攻击成本降低至现有基线的13%以下，能够有效泛化到不同图像风格并高效窃取未见过的提示模板。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了提示词交易中紧迫的安全威胁，为新兴MLLMs市场制定保护标准奠定了基础。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have transformed text-to-image
workflows, allowing designers to create novel visual concepts with
unprecedented speed. This progress has given rise to a thriving prompt trading
market, where curated prompts that induce trademark styles are bought and sold.
Although commercially attractive, prompt trading also introduces a largely
unexamined security risk: the prompts themselves can be stolen.
  In this paper, we expose this vulnerability and present RLStealer, a
reinforcement learning based prompt inversion framework that recovers its
template from only a small set of example images. RLStealer treats template
stealing as a sequential decision making problem and employs multiple
similarity based feedback signals as reward functions to effectively explore
the prompt space. Comprehensive experiments on publicly available benchmarks
demonstrate that RLStealer gets state-of-the-art performance while reducing the
total attack cost to under 13% of that required by existing baselines. Our
further analysis confirms that RLStealer can effectively generalize across
different image styles to efficiently steal unseen prompt templates. Our study
highlights an urgent security threat inherent in prompt trading and lays the
groundwork for developing protective standards in the emerging MLLMs
marketplace.

### [8] [Explanation-Driven Counterfactual Testing for Faithfulness in Vision-Language Model Explanations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00047)
*Sihao Ding,Santosh Vasa,Aditi Ramadwar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出EDCT方法，通过反事实测试自动验证视觉语言模型生成的自然语言解释的忠实性，发现模型解释与预测因果因素之间存在显著不匹配问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型生成的自然语言解释听起来有说服力，但可能不反映实际驱动预测的因果因素，这种可信度与忠实性之间的不匹配带来了技术和治理风险。

Method: EDCT方法包括四个步骤：获取模型答案和解释、将解释解析为可测试的视觉概念、通过生成修复进行针对性反事实编辑、使用LLM辅助分析计算反事实一致性分数。

Result: 在120个OK-VQA示例和多个VLM上的测试显示，EDCT揭示了显著的忠实性差距，并提供了监管对齐的审计证据，表明引用的概念未能通过因果测试。

Conclusion: EDCT提供了一种自动验证VLM解释忠实性的方法，有助于识别和缓解模型解释与真实因果因素之间的不匹配问题。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often produce fluent Natural Language
Explanations (NLEs) that sound convincing but may not reflect the causal
factors driving predictions. This mismatch of plausibility and faithfulness
poses technical and governance risks. We introduce Explanation-Driven
Counterfactual Testing (EDCT), a fully automated verification procedure for a
target VLM that treats the model's own explanation as a falsifiable hypothesis.
Given an image-question pair, EDCT: (1) obtains the model's answer and NLE, (2)
parses the NLE into testable visual concepts, (3) generates targeted
counterfactual edits via generative inpainting, and (4) computes a
Counterfactual Consistency Score (CCS) using LLM-assisted analysis of changes
in both answers and explanations. Across 120 curated OK-VQA examples and
multiple VLMs, EDCT uncovers substantial faithfulness gaps and provides
regulator-aligned audit artifacts indicating when cited concepts fail causal
tests.

### [9] [HiDe: Rethinking The Zoom-IN method in High Resolution MLLMs via Hierarchical Decoupling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00054)
*Xianjie Liu,Yiman Hu,Yixiong Zou,Liang Wu,Jian Xu,Bo Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出HiDe框架，通过分层解耦方法解决MLLMs在高分辨率图像中因复杂背景干扰导致的性能下降问题，无需训练即可显著提升性能并减少内存使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法认为MLLMs在高分辨率图像中表现不佳是因为无法识别小物体，但本文分析发现主要问题其实是复杂背景干扰，而非物体大小。

Method: 提出分层解耦框架HiDe：1）使用Token-wise Attention Decoupling解耦问题token并识别关键信息token；2）使用Layout-Preserving Decoupling从背景中解耦目标区域并重建紧凑表示。

Result: 在V*Bench、HRBench4K和HRBench8K上达到新的SOTA，将Qwen2.5-VL 7B和InternVL3 8B分别提升至92.1%和91.6%，内存使用比之前无训练方法减少75%。

Conclusion: HiDe框架有效解决了MLLMs在高分辨率图像中的背景干扰问题，无需训练即可显著提升性能，为视觉理解任务提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made significant strides in
visual understanding tasks. However, their performance on high-resolution
images remains suboptimal. While existing approaches often attribute this
limitation to perceptual constraints and argue that MLLMs struggle to recognize
small objects, leading them to use "zoom in" strategies for better detail, our
analysis reveals a different cause: the main issue is not object size, but
rather caused by complex background interference. We systematically analyze
this "zoom in" operation through a series of decoupling experiments and propose
the Hierarchical Decoupling Framework (HiDe), a training-free framework that
uses Token-wise Attention Decoupling (TAD) to decouple the question tokens and
identify the key information tokens, then leverages their attention weights to
achieve precise alignment with the target visual regions. Subsequently, it
employs Layout-Preserving Decoupling (LPD) to decouple these regions from the
background and reconstructs a compact representation that preserves essential
spatial layouts while eliminating background interference. HiDe sets a new SOTA
on V*Bench, HRBench4K, and HRBench8K, boosting Qwen2.5-VL 7B and InternVL3 8B
to SOTA (92.1% and 91.6% on V*Bench), even surpassing RL methods. After
optimization, HiDe uses 75% less memory than the previous training-free
approach. Code is provided in https://github.com/Tennine2077/HiDe.

### [10] [FSDENet: A Frequency and Spatial Domains based Detail Enhancement Network for Remote Sensing Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00059)
*Jiahao Fu,Yinfeng Yu,Liejun Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了FSDENet网络，通过结合空间域和频域信息来增强遥感图像分割的细节处理能力，特别是在边界区域和灰度变化区域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决遥感图像分割中由于灰度变化（如阴影和低对比度区域）导致的语义边缘模糊问题，充分利用空间信息。

Method: 使用空间处理方法提取多尺度空间特征和细粒度语义细节，通过FFT整合全局和频域信息，利用Haar小波变换分解特征为高低频组件来优化边界分割。

Result: 在LoveDA、Vaihingen、Potsdam和iSAID四个数据集上达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: FSDENet通过空间粒度和频域边缘敏感性的双域协同，显著提高了边界区域和灰度过渡区的分割精度。

Abstract: To fully leverage spatial information for remote sensing image segmentation
and address semantic edge ambiguities caused by grayscale variations (e.g.,
shadows and low-contrast regions), we propose the Frequency and Spatial Domains
based Detail Enhancement Network (FSDENet). Our framework employs spatial
processing methods to extract rich multi-scale spatial features and
fine-grained semantic details. By effectively integrating global and
frequency-domain information through the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) in global
mappings, the model's capability to discern global representations under
grayscale variations is significantly strengthened. Additionally, we utilize
Haar wavelet transform to decompose features into high- and low-frequency
components, leveraging their distinct sensitivity to edge information to refine
boundary segmentation. The model achieves dual-domain synergy by integrating
spatial granularity with frequency-domain edge sensitivity, substantially
improving segmentation accuracy in boundary regions and grayscale transition
zones. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that FSDENet achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on four widely adopted datasets: LoveDA,
Vaihingen, Potsdam, and iSAID.

*Sheng Yang,Tong Zhan,Guancheng Chen,Yanfeng Lu,Jian Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Max-V1框架将自动驾驶重新概念化为广义语言，将轨迹规划任务表述为下一个路径点预测，通过单次生成范式实现端到端轨迹预测，在nuScenes数据集上达到最先进性能，相比基线提升30%以上。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将自动驾驶重新概念化为广义语言问题，利用视觉语言模型的生成能力直接从前置摄像头输入进行端到端轨迹预测，简化复杂的驾驶策略学习过程。

Method: 提出Max-V1单阶段端到端自动驾驶框架，采用基于统计建模的原则性监督策略，通过模仿学习从大规模专家演示中学习复杂驾驶策略，将轨迹规划任务表述为下一个路径点预测。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上达到最先进性能，相比先前基线总体提升超过30%，在跨域数据集上表现出优异的泛化性能，展示了跨车辆鲁棒性和适应性。

Conclusion: 这项工作引入了一个能够实现基本驾驶行为的模型，为开发更强大的自动驾驶智能体奠定了基础，展示了端到端方法在自动驾驶领域的潜力。

Abstract: In this work, we reconceptualize autonomous driving as a generalized language
and formulate the trajectory planning task as next waypoint prediction. We
introduce Max-V1, a novel framework for one-stage end-to-end autonomous
driving. Our framework presents a single-pass generation paradigm that aligns
with the inherent sequentiality of driving. This approach leverages the
generative capacity of the VLM (Vision-Language Model) to enable end-to-end
trajectory prediction directly from front-view camera input. The efficacy of
this method is underpinned by a principled supervision strategy derived from
statistical modeling. This provides a well-defined learning objective, which
makes the framework highly amenable to master complex driving policies through
imitation learning from large-scale expert demonstrations. Empirically, our
method achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the nuScenes dataset,
delivers an overall improvement of over 30% compared to prior baselines.
Furthermore, it exhibits superior generalization performance on cross-domain
datasets acquired from diverse vehicles, demonstrating notable potential for
cross-vehicle robustness and adaptability. Due to these empirical strengths,
this work introduces a model enabling fundamental driving behaviors, laying the
foundation for the development of more capable self-driving agents. Code will
be available upon publication.

### [12] [Efficient CNN Compression via Multi-method Low Rank Factorization and Feature Map Similarity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00062)
*M. Kokhazadeh,G. Keramidas,V. Kelefouras*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种端到端的CNN压缩设计空间探索框架，通过基于特征图相似性的秩选择策略和一次性微调过程，显著降低了压缩时间和设计复杂度，同时支持多种低秩分解方法在单模型中的选择性应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统低秩分解方法面临秩选择困难、设计空间庞大、微调时间长、兼容性有限等问题，需要一种更高效的端到端压缩解决方案。

Method: 基于特征图相似性的秩选择策略、一次性微调过程、支持卷积层和全连接层的多种低秩分解技术选择性应用，集成到TensorFlow 2.x框架。

Result: 在14个CNN模型和8个数据集上的实验表明，该方法实现了显著压缩且精度损失最小，优于多种最先进技术。

Conclusion: 该框架通过智能秩选择和多种分解技术的组合应用，为CNN压缩提供了高效且兼容性强的解决方案，在压缩率和精度间取得了良好平衡。

Abstract: Low-Rank Factorization (LRF) is a widely adopted technique for compressing
deep neural networks (DNNs). However, it faces several challenges, including
optimal rank selection, a vast design space, long fine-tuning times, and
limited compatibility with different layer types and decomposition methods.
This paper presents an end-to-end Design Space Exploration (DSE) methodology
and framework for compressing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that
addresses all these issues. We introduce a novel rank selection strategy based
on feature map similarity, which captures non-linear interactions between layer
outputs more effectively than traditional weight-based approaches. Unlike prior
works, our method uses a one-shot fine-tuning process, significantly reducing
the overall fine-tuning time. The proposed framework is fully compatible with
all types of convolutional (Conv) and fully connected (FC) layers. To further
improve compression, the framework integrates three different LRF techniques
for Conv layers and three for FC layers, applying them selectively on a
per-layer basis. We demonstrate that combining multiple LRF methods within a
single model yields better compression results than using a single method
uniformly across all layers. Finally, we provide a comprehensive evaluation and
comparison of the six LRF techniques, offering practical insights into their
effectiveness across different scenarios. The proposed work is integrated into
TensorFlow 2.x, ensuring compatibility with widely used deep learning
workflows. Experimental results on 14 CNN models across eight datasets
demonstrate that the proposed methodology achieves substantial compression with
minimal accuracy loss, outperforming several state-of-the-art techniques.

Abstract: The evolution of the 5S methodology with the support of artificial
intelligence techniques represents a significant opportunity to improve
industrial organization audits in the automotive chain, making them more
objective, efficient and aligned with Industry 4.0 standards. This work
developed an automated 5S audit system based on large-scale language models
(LLM), capable of assessing the five senses (Seiri, Seiton, Seiso, Seiketsu,
Shitsuke) in a standardized way through intelligent image analysis. The
system's reliability was validated using Cohen's concordance coefficient (kappa
= 0.75), showing strong alignment between the automated assessments and the
corresponding human audits. The results indicate that the proposed solution
contributes significantly to continuous improvement in automotive manufacturing
environments, speeding up the audit process by 50% of the traditional time and
maintaining the consistency of the assessments, with a 99.8% reduction in
operating costs compared to traditional manual audits. The methodology
presented establishes a new paradigm for integrating lean systems with emerging
AI technologies, offering scalability for implementation in automotive plants
of different sizes.

Abstract: Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
impressive capabilities. However, evaluating their capacity for human-like
understanding in One-Image Guides remains insufficiently explored. One-Image
Guides are a visual format combining text, imagery, and symbols to present
reorganized and structured information for easier comprehension, which are
specifically designed for human viewing and inherently embody the
characteristics of human perception and understanding. Here, we present
OIG-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark focused on One-Image Guide understanding
across diverse domains. To reduce the cost of manual annotation, we developed a
semi-automated annotation pipeline in which multiple intelligent agents
collaborate to generate preliminary image descriptions, assisting humans in
constructing image-text pairs. With OIG-Bench, we have conducted a
comprehensive evaluation of 29 state-of-the-art MLLMs, including both
proprietary and open-source models. The results show that Qwen2.5-VL-72B
performs the best among the evaluated models, with an overall accuracy of 77%.
Nevertheless, all models exhibit notable weaknesses in semantic understanding
and logical reasoning, indicating that current MLLMs still struggle to
accurately interpret complex visual-text relationships. In addition, we also
demonstrate that the proposed multi-agent annotation system outperforms all
MLLMs in image captioning, highlighting its potential as both a high-quality
image description generator and a valuable tool for future dataset
construction. Datasets are available at https://github.com/XiejcSYSU/OIG-Bench.

Motivation: 传统地理空间建模主要依赖领域预训练和监督微调，缺乏专门的推理能力。Geo-R1旨在解决这一限制，通过后训练方法解锁视觉语言模型的地理空间推理能力。

Method: 1. 脚手架阶段：使用合成的思维链示例进行监督微调，建立地理空间思维范式；2. 提升阶段：基于GRPO的强化学习，利用弱监督的跨视角配对代理提供可验证的奖励信号。

Conclusion: Geo-R1将地理空间建模从领域预训练/监督微调扩展到推理优先的后训练范式，为地理空间AI提供了新的发展方向。

Abstract: We introduce Geo-R1, a reasoning-centric post-training framework that unlocks
geospatial reasoning in vision-language models by combining thinking
scaffolding and elevating. In the scaffolding stage, Geo-R1 instills a
``geospatial thinking paradigm" via supervised fine-tuning on synthetic
chain-of-thought exemplars, enabling models to connect visual cues with
geographic priors without costly human reasoning annotations. In the elevating
stage, it uses GRPO-based reinforcement learning on a weakly-supervised
cross-view pairing proxy. This design supplies a verifiable and scalable reward
signal: teaching models to capture and reconcile features across modalities,
and harnessing reasoning for accurate prediction. Geo-R1 extends geospatial
modeling from domain pretraining / supervised finetuning to reasoning-first
post-training, and achieves state-of-the-art performance across various
geospatial reasoning benchmarks. Our model is available at

Conclusion: 基于USN的剪枝方法能有效减少过参数化，在保持模型表达能力的同时提升鲁棒性认证性能。

Abstract: Deep neural networks have been widely adopted in many vision and robotics
applications with visual inputs. It is essential to verify its robustness
against semantic transformation perturbations, such as brightness and contrast.
However, current certified training and robustness certification methods face
the challenge of over-parameterization, which hinders the tightness and
scalability due to the over-complicated neural networks. To this end, we first
analyze stability and variance of layers and neurons against input
perturbation, showing that certifiable robustness can be indicated by a
fundamental Unbiased and Smooth Neuron metric (USN). Based on USN, we introduce
a novel neural network pruning method that removes neurons with low USN and
retains those with high USN, thereby preserving model expressiveness without
over-parameterization. To further enhance this pruning process, we propose a
new Wasserstein distance loss to ensure that pruned neurons are more
concentrated across layers. We validate our approach through extensive
experiments on the challenging robust keypoint detection task, which involves
realistic brightness and contrast perturbations, demonstrating that our method
achieves superior robustness certification performance and efficiency compared
to baselines.

Result: 在五个不同数据集上的综合评估表明，该方法优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 基于传输理论的数学框架为高光谱异常检测提供了有效解决方案，在复杂环境中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Hyperspectral anomaly detection (HAD), a crucial approach for many civilian
and military applications, seeks to identify pixels with spectral signatures
that are anomalous relative to a preponderance of background signatures.
Significant effort has been made to improve HAD techniques, but challenges
arise due to complex real-world environments and, by definition, limited prior
knowledge of potential signatures of interest. This paper introduces a novel
HAD method by proposing a transport-based mathematical model to describe the
pixels comprising a given hyperspectral image. In this approach, hyperspectral
pixels are viewed as observations of a template pattern undergoing unknown
deformations that enables their representation in the signed cumulative
distribution transform (SCDT) domain. An unsupervised subspace modeling
technique is then used to construct a model of abundant background signals in
this domain, whereupon anomalous signals are detected as deviations from the
learned model. Comprehensive evaluations across five distinct datasets
illustrate the superiority of our approach compared to state-of-the-art
methods.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于LoRA适配器的通用水印框架MOLM，通过密钥激活轻量级LoRA模块来嵌入水印，解决了现有水印方法对失真敏感、易被移除和更新成本高的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成模型能大规模生成逼真图像，引发了检测合成图像和溯源来源的迫切需求。现有水印方法对现实失真脆弱、易被自适应移除，且更新水印密钥成本高昂。

Method: 提出通用水印框架，将编码问题建模为生成模型参数的密钥相关扰动。具体实现MOLM，通过二进制密钥激活残差块和注意力块中的轻量级LoRA适配器，避免密钥特定的重新训练。

Result: 在Stable Diffusion和FLUX上的实验表明，MOLM在保持图像质量的同时，能够抵抗失真、压缩、再生、平均攻击和对提取器的黑盒对抗攻击，实现稳健的密钥恢复。

Conclusion: MOLM框架实现了不可感知性、保真度、可验证性和鲁棒性等理想特性，为生成图像的水印提供了一种有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Generative models can generate photorealistic images at scale. This raises
urgent concerns about the ability to detect synthetically generated images and
attribute these images to specific sources. While watermarking has emerged as a
possible solution, existing methods remain fragile to realistic distortions,
susceptible to adaptive removal, and expensive to update when the underlying
watermarking key changes. We propose a general watermarking framework that
formulates the encoding problem as key-dependent perturbation of the parameters
of a generative model. Within this framework, we introduce Mixture of LoRA
Markers (MOLM), a routing-based instantiation in which binary keys activate
lightweight LoRA adapters inside residual and attention blocks. This design
avoids key-specific re-training and achieves the desired properties such as
imperceptibility, fidelity, verifiability, and robustness. Experiments on
Stable Diffusion and FLUX show that MOLM preserves image quality while
achieving robust key recovery against distortions, compression and
regeneration, averaging attacks, and black-box adversarial attacks on the
extractor.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有开放世界目标检测方法存在已知与未知类别间的语义混淆以及灾难性遗忘问题，导致未知类别召回率下降和已知类别准确率退化。

Method: 提出CROWD框架，包含CROWD-Discover（使用子模条件增益函数策略性挖掘未知实例）和CROWD-Learn（使用组合目标联合解耦已知与未知表示，同时保持已知类别的判别一致性）。

Result: 在OWOD基准测试中，CROWD在M-OWODB和S-OWODB上分别将已知类别准确率提升了2.83%和2.05%，未知类别召回率相比领先基线提升了近2.4倍。

Conclusion: CROWD通过组合式方法有效解决了开放世界目标检测中的语义混淆和灾难性遗忘问题，显著提升了检测性能。

Abstract: Open-World Object Detection (OWOD) enriches traditional object detectors by
enabling continual discovery and integration of unknown objects via human
guidance. However, existing OWOD approaches frequently suffer from semantic
confusion between known and unknown classes, alongside catastrophic forgetting,
leading to diminished unknown recall and degraded known-class accuracy. To
overcome these challenges, we propose Combinatorial Open-World Detection
(CROWD), a unified framework reformulating unknown object discovery and
adaptation as an interwoven combinatorial (set-based) data-discovery
(CROWD-Discover) and representation learning (CROWD-Learn) task. CROWD-Discover
strategically mines unknown instances by maximizing Submodular Conditional Gain
(SCG) functions, selecting representative examples distinctly dissimilar from
known objects. Subsequently, CROWD-Learn employs novel combinatorial objectives
that jointly disentangle known and unknown representations while maintaining
discriminative coherence among known classes, thus mitigating confusion and
forgetting. Extensive evaluations on OWOD benchmarks illustrate that CROWD
achieves improvements of 2.83% and 2.05% in known-class accuracy on M-OWODB and
S-OWODB, respectively, and nearly 2.4x unknown recall compared to leading
baselines.

Method: 提出ExpDWT-VAE方法，采用双分支结构：一个分支处理空间域输入，另一个分支通过2D Haar小波分解提取和处理频域特征，最后合并形成集成的空间-频率表示

Result: 在多个性能指标上的实验结果表明，该方法能有效增强潜在空间表示，使用TerraFly地图系统中的新卫星图像数据集验证了方法的有效性

Conclusion: 通过离散小波变换增强VAE潜在空间表示的方法在卫星图像处理中表现出色，为遥感应用中的潜在扩散模型提供了改进方案

Abstract: Latent Diffusion Models (LDM), a subclass of diffusion models, mitigate the
computational complexity of pixel-space diffusion by operating within a
compressed latent space constructed by Variational Autoencoders (VAEs),
demonstrating significant advantages in Remote Sensing (RS) applications.
Though numerous studies enhancing LDMs have been conducted, investigations
explicitly targeting improvements within the intrinsic latent space remain
scarce. This paper proposes an innovative perspective, utilizing the Discrete
Wavelet Transform (DWT) to enhance the VAE's latent space representation,
designed for satellite imagery. The proposed method, ExpDWT-VAE, introduces
dual branches: one processes spatial domain input through convolutional
operations, while the other extracts and processes frequency-domain features
via 2D Haar wavelet decomposition, convolutional operation, and inverse DWT
reconstruction. These branches merge to create an integrated spatial-frequency
representation, further refined through convolutional and diagonal Gaussian
mapping into a robust latent representation. We utilize a new satellite imagery
dataset housed by the TerraFly mapping system to validate our method.
Experimental results across several performance metrics highlight the efficacy
of the proposed method at enhancing latent space representation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有轨迹预测方法假设理想化的观测历史，忽略了第一人称视角固有的感知伪影（如遮挡、ID切换、跟踪漂移），导致模型在实际部署中鲁棒性不足。

Method: 提出BiFlow双流流匹配模型，同时去噪历史观测和预测未来运动；引入EgoAnchor机制，通过特征调制将提炼的历史特征条件化到预测解码器中。

Result: BiFlow在minADE和minFDE指标上平均降低10-15%，达到最先进性能，并展现出优越的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: EgoTraj-Bench基准和BiFlow模型为开发真正适应现实世界第一人称感知挑战的轨迹预测系统提供了关键基础。

Abstract: Reliable trajectory prediction from an ego-centric perspective is crucial for
robotic navigation in human-centric environments. However, existing methods
typically assume idealized observation histories, failing to account for the
perceptual artifacts inherent in first-person vision, such as occlusions, ID
switches, and tracking drift. This discrepancy between training assumptions and
deployment reality severely limits model robustness. To bridge this gap, we
introduce EgoTraj-Bench, the first real-world benchmark that grounds noisy,
first-person visual histories in clean, bird's-eye-view future trajectories,
enabling robust learning under realistic perceptual constraints. Building on
this benchmark, we propose BiFlow, a dual-stream flow matching model that
concurrently denoises historical observations and forecasts future motion by
leveraging a shared latent representation. To better model agent intent, BiFlow
incorporates our EgoAnchor mechanism, which conditions the prediction decoder
on distilled historical features via feature modulation. Extensive experiments
show that BiFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance, reducing minADE and
minFDE by 10-15% on average and demonstrating superior robustness. We
anticipate that our benchmark and model will provide a critical foundation for
developing trajectory forecasting systems truly resilient to the challenges of
real-world, ego-centric perception.

Motivation: 探索自动化方法在胸部X光片解读中的准确性，比较监督学习与零样本学习在医学影像诊断中的表现差异。

Method: 在两个诊断任务（肺炎检测和结核病检测）上对比轻量级CNN与BiomedCLIP VLM，采用决策阈值校准来优化VLM性能。

Result: 校准后VLM在肺炎检测中F1-score达0.8841（优于CNN的0.8803），在结核病检测中从0.4812提升至0.7684（接近CNN的0.7834）。

Conclusion: 适当的校准对于发挥零样本VLMs的诊断潜力至关重要，使其能够匹配甚至超越任务特定的监督模型。

Abstract: The accurate interpretation of chest radiographs using automated methods is a
critical task in medical imaging. This paper presents a comparative analysis
between a supervised lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a
state-of-the-art, zero-shot medical Vision-Language Model (VLM), BiomedCLIP,
across two distinct diagnostic tasks: pneumonia detection on the PneumoniaMNIST
benchmark and tuberculosis detection on the Shenzhen TB dataset. Our
experiments show that supervised CNNs serve as highly competitive baselines in
both cases. While the default zero-shot performance of the VLM is lower, we
demonstrate that its potential can be unlocked via a simple yet crucial remedy:
decision threshold calibration. By optimizing the classification threshold on a
validation set, the performance of BiomedCLIP is significantly boosted across
both datasets. For pneumonia detection, calibration enables the zero-shot VLM
to achieve a superior F1-score of 0.8841, surpassing the supervised CNN's
0.8803. For tuberculosis detection, calibration dramatically improves the
F1-score from 0.4812 to 0.7684, bringing it close to the supervised baseline's
0.7834. This work highlights a key insight: proper calibration is essential for
leveraging the full diagnostic power of zero-shot VLMs, enabling them to match
or even outperform efficient, task-specific supervised models.

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents powered by Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) promise human-like interaction with software applications, yet
long-horizon tasks remain challenging due to memory limitations. Existing
approaches either truncate history or rely on simple textual summaries, which
risk losing critical information when past visual details become necessary for
future decisions. In this paper, we propose \textbf{PAL-UI} (\textbf{P}lanning
with \textbf{A}ctive \textbf{L}ook-back), a novel framework that enables GUI
agents to adaptively retrieve past observations when required. PAL-UI combines
a dual-level summarization agent, capturing both observation-level cues and
action-level outcomes, with a dedicated retrieval tool that allows the agent to
recall specific historical screenshots during planning. We curate a step-level
instruction dataset of 8.6K samples from mobile GUI navigation trajectories and
train \textbf{PAL-UI-3B} and \textbf{PAL-UI-7B} models based on Qwen2.5-VL.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that PAL-UI significantly outperforms
baseline models and prior methods in mobile GUI navigation tasks, even under
data-efficient settings. Moreover, PAL-UI exhibits strong cross-domain
generalization, achieving notable improvements in web navigation without
additional training. Our work highlights the potential of active memory
retrieval for long-horizon planning capabilities of vision-based GUI agents.

Abstract: Precise delineation of meningiomas is crucial for effective radiotherapy (RT)
planning, directly influencing treatment efficacy and preservation of adjacent
healthy tissues. While automated deep learning approaches have demonstrated
considerable potential, achieving consistently accurate clinical segmentation
remains challenging due to tumor heterogeneity. Interactive Medical Image
Segmentation (IMIS) addresses this challenge by integrating advanced AI
techniques with clinical input. However, generic segmentation tools, despite
widespread applicability, often lack the specificity required for clinically
critical and disease-specific tasks like meningioma RT planning. To overcome
these limitations, we introduce Interactive-MEN-RT, a dedicated IMIS tool
specifically developed for clinician-assisted 3D meningioma segmentation in RT
workflows. The system incorporates multiple clinically relevant interaction
methods, including point annotations, bounding boxes, lasso tools, and
scribbles, enhancing usability and clinical precision. In our evaluation
involving 500 contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI scans from the BraTS 2025
Meningioma RT Segmentation Challenge, Interactive-MEN-RT demonstrated
substantial improvement compared to other segmentation methods, achieving Dice
similarity coefficients of up to 77.6\% and Intersection over Union scores of
64.8\%. These results emphasize the need for clinically tailored segmentation
solutions in critical applications such as meningioma RT planning. The code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频生成模型在解析复杂空间关系、时间逻辑和多主题交互的提示词方面存在困难，导致主题一致性不足。

Method: 提出MLLM-DiT框架，使用预训练多模态大语言模型进行深度跨模态推理，识别实体并解耦角色、属性和交互，生成主题感知的隐藏状态来指导扩散变换器。

Conclusion: BindWeave通过深度跨模态推理有效解决了复杂提示词解析问题，实现了高质量的主题一致视频生成。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformer has shown remarkable abilities in generating
high-fidelity videos, delivering visually coherent frames and rich details over
extended durations. However, existing video generation models still fall short
in subject-consistent video generation due to an inherent difficulty in parsing
prompts that specify complex spatial relationships, temporal logic, and
interactions among multiple subjects. To address this issue, we propose
BindWeave, a unified framework that handles a broad range of subject-to-video
scenarios from single-subject cases to complex multi-subject scenes with
heterogeneous entities. To bind complex prompt semantics to concrete visual
subjects, we introduce an MLLM-DiT framework in which a pretrained multimodal
large language model performs deep cross-modal reasoning to ground entities and
disentangle roles, attributes, and interactions, yielding subject-aware hidden
states that condition the diffusion transformer for high-fidelity
subject-consistent video generation. Experiments on the OpenS2V benchmark
demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance across subject
consistency, naturalness, and text relevance in generated videos, outperforming
existing open-source and commercial models.

TL;DR: 提出SCNet网络优化自监督图像去噪，通过频率控制解决高频细节保留不足和噪声学习问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自监督去噪方法存在两个问题：高频结构细节保留不足，以及在拟合高频时学习到噪声

Method: 1. 频率带选择策略加速训练收敛；2. 使用Lipschitz常数限制卷积核学习高频噪声；3. 提出SSR模块通过频域分离和低秩重建分离噪声与高频细节

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验验证了SCNet的有效性

Conclusion: SCNet通过频谱控制有效解决了自监督去噪中的高频细节保留和噪声学习问题

Abstract: Current self-supervised denoising methods for paired noisy images typically
involve mapping one noisy image through the network to the other noisy image.
However, after measuring the spectral bias of such methods using our proposed
Image Pair Frequency-Band Similarity, it suffers from two practical
limitations. Firstly, the high-frequency structural details in images are not
preserved well enough. Secondly, during the process of fitting high
frequencies, the network learns high-frequency noise from the mapped noisy
images. To address these challenges, we introduce a Spectral Controlling
network (SCNet) to optimize self-supervised denoising of paired noisy images.
First, we propose a selection strategy to choose frequency band components for
noisy images, to accelerate the convergence speed of training. Next, we present
a parameter optimization method that restricts the learning ability of
convolutional kernels to high-frequency noise using the Lipschitz constant,
without changing the network structure. Finally, we introduce the Spectral
Separation and low-rank Reconstruction module (SSR module), which separates
noise and high-frequency details through frequency domain separation and
low-rank space reconstruction, to retain the high-frequency structural details
of images. Experiments performed on synthetic and real-world datasets verify
the effectiveness of SCNet.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言目标检测器在零样本识别方面表现出色，但在领域偏移下性能会下降，需要测试时适应方法来改善泛化能力。

Method: 提出两个关键方法：1）IoU加权熵目标，专注于空间一致的建议框簇；2）图像条件提示选择，根据图像级兼容性对提示进行排序并与检测器logits融合。

Result: 在多种分布偏移场景（风格化域、驾驶场景、低光条件和常见损坏）上的实验表明，该方法在YOLO-World和Grounding DINO上均优于零样本和TTA基线方法。

Conclusion: VLOD-TTA通过结合空间一致性和图像条件提示选择，有效提升了视觉语言目标检测器在领域偏移下的适应能力。

Abstract: Vision-language object detectors (VLODs) such as YOLO-World and Grounding
DINO achieve impressive zero-shot recognition by aligning region proposals with
text representations. However, their performance often degrades under domain
shift. We introduce VLOD-TTA, a test-time adaptation (TTA) framework for VLODs
that leverages dense proposal overlap and image-conditioned prompt scores.
First, an IoU-weighted entropy objective is proposed that concentrates
adaptation on spatially coherent proposal clusters and reduces confirmation
bias from isolated boxes. Second, image-conditioned prompt selection is
introduced, which ranks prompts by image-level compatibility and fuses the most
informative prompts with the detector logits. Our benchmarking across diverse
distribution shifts -- including stylized domains, driving scenes, low-light
conditions, and common corruptions -- shows the effectiveness of our method on
two state-of-the-art VLODs, YOLO-World and Grounding DINO, with consistent
improvements over the zero-shot and TTA baselines. Code :

TL;DR: MathSticks是一个视觉符号组合推理基准测试，通过移动火柴棍来修正错误方程，结合视觉感知、符号操作和算术一致性，包含140万生成实例和精选测试集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型在视觉符号组合推理方面存在显著局限，需要建立一个严格的测试基准来评估和改进模型在这方面的能力。

Method: 创建包含文本引导和纯视觉两种设置的火柴棍方程修正任务，系统覆盖数字规模、移动复杂度、解的多重性和运算符变化等维度。

Result: 评估14个视觉语言模型发现：闭源模型仅在简单案例上成功，开源模型在视觉模式下失败，而人类准确率超过90%。

Conclusion: MathSticks为推进视觉和符号的组合推理提供了一个严格的测试平台，揭示了当前模型的局限性。

Abstract: We introduce \textsc{MathSticks}, a benchmark for Visual Symbolic
Compositional Reasoning (VSCR), which unifies visual perception, symbolic
manipulation, and arithmetic consistency. Each task presents an incorrect
matchstick equation that must be corrected by moving one or two sticks under
strict conservation rules. The benchmark includes both text-guided and purely
visual settings, systematically covering digit scale, move complexity, solution
multiplicity, and operator variation, with 1.4M generated instances and a
curated test set. Evaluations of 14 vision--language models reveal substantial
limitations: closed-source models succeed only on simple cases, open-source
models fail in the visual regime, while humans exceed 90\% accuracy. These
findings establish \textsc{MathSticks} as a rigorous testbed for advancing
compositional reasoning across vision and symbols. Our code and dataset are
publicly available at https://github.com/Yuheng2000/MathSticks.

### [29] [Normal-Abnormal Guided Generalist Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00495)
*Yuexin Wang,Xiaolei Wang,Yizheng Gong,Jimin Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了NAGL框架，利用正常和异常样本作为参考，通过残差挖掘和异常特征学习实现跨领域通用异常检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有通用异常检测方法仅使用正常样本作为参考，忽略了真实场景中可用的异常样本所包含的宝贵信息。

Method: 提出Normal-Abnormal Generalist Learning框架，包含残差挖掘和异常特征学习两个核心组件，从正常-异常参考残差中提取异常模式并自适应学习查询图像中的异常特征。

Result: 在多个基准测试上的广泛实验表明，该方法显著优于现有的通用异常检测方法。

Conclusion: 这是首个在通用异常检测中采用正常和异常样本混合作为参考的工作，能更准确高效地进行跨领域异常检测。

Abstract: Generalist Anomaly Detection (GAD) aims to train a unified model on an
original domain that can detect anomalies in new target domains. Previous GAD
methods primarily use only normal samples as references, overlooking the
valuable information contained in anomalous samples that are often available in
real-world scenarios. To address this limitation, we propose a more practical
approach: normal-abnormal-guided generalist anomaly detection, which leverages
both normal and anomalous samples as references to guide anomaly detection
across diverse domains. We introduce the Normal-Abnormal Generalist Learning
(NAGL) framework, consisting of two key components: Residual Mining (RM) and
Anomaly Feature Learning (AFL). RM extracts abnormal patterns from
normal-abnormal reference residuals to establish transferable anomaly
representations, while AFL adaptively learns anomaly features in query images
through residual mapping to identify instance-aware anomalies. Our approach
effectively utilizes both normal and anomalous references for more accurate and
efficient cross-domain anomaly detection. Extensive experiments across multiple
benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing GAD
approaches. This work represents the first to adopt a mixture of normal and
abnormal samples as references in generalist anomaly detection. The code and
datasets are available at https://github.com/JasonKyng/NAGL.

*Kaiqi Zhang,Mingguan Yang,Dali Chang,Chun Chen,Yuxiang Zhang,Kexun He,Jing Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了RAF（相对-绝对融合）特征提取技术，通过融合图像表示和数值特征来改进稀疏线性系统的迭代方法选择，解决了传统图像方法中不同矩阵可能产生相同表示的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于图像的选择方法存在特征提取问题，可能将不同矩阵编码为相同的图像表示，导致选择相同的次优方法，缺乏鲁棒性。

Method: RAF技术同时提取和融合图像表示作为相对特征，以及对应的数值作为绝对特征，创建全面的矩阵表示以避免特征模糊。

Result: 在SuiteSparse和BMCMat数据集上的评估显示，RAF将稀疏线性系统的求解时间减少了0.08s-0.29s，比传统图像选择方法快5.86%-11.50%，达到了最先进性能。

Conclusion: RAF通过相对-绝对特征融合有效提升了基于图像的选择方法的准确性和潜力，解决了特征模糊问题，实现了更好的迭代方法选择。

Abstract: Iterative method selection is crucial for solving sparse linear systems
because these methods inherently lack robustness. Though image-based selection
approaches have shown promise, their feature extraction techniques might encode
distinct matrices into identical image representations, leading to the same
selection and suboptimal method. In this paper, we introduce RAF
(Relative-Absolute Fusion), an efficient feature extraction technique to
enhance image-based selection approaches. By simultaneously extracting and
fusing image representations as relative features with corresponding numerical
values as absolute features, RAF achieves comprehensive matrix representations
that prevent feature ambiguity across distinct matrices, thus improving
selection accuracy and unlocking the potential of image-based selection
approaches. We conducted comprehensive evaluations of RAF on SuiteSparse and
our developed BMCMat (Balanced Multi-Classification Matrix dataset),
demonstrating solution time reductions of 0.08s-0.29s for sparse linear
systems, which is 5.86%-11.50% faster than conventional image-based selection
approaches and achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. BMCMat is

### [31] [Affordance-Guided Diffusion Prior for 3D Hand Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00506)
*Naru Suzuki,Takehiko Ohkawa,Tatsuro Banno,Jihyun Lee,Ryosuke Furuta,Yoichi Sato*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种基于扩散模型的生成式手部姿态优化方法，利用从大视觉语言模型推断的affordance感知文本描述来指导被遮挡手部区域的重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决手部被自身或物体严重遮挡时的3D手部姿态重建问题，受人类利用上下文知识（如affordance）解决模糊性的启发。

Method: 使用扩散生成模型学习在affordance描述条件下的合理手部姿态分布，通过VLM推断手物交互的affordance感知文本描述来指导姿态优化。

Result: 在HOGraspNet数据集上的实验表明，该方法显著优于最近的回归方法和缺乏上下文推理的基于扩散的优化方法。

Conclusion: affordance引导的优化能够显著提高手部姿态估计的准确性，特别是在严重遮挡情况下。

Abstract: How can we reconstruct 3D hand poses when large portions of the hand are
heavily occluded by itself or by objects? Humans often resolve such ambiguities
by leveraging contextual knowledge -- such as affordances, where an object's
shape and function suggest how the object is typically grasped. Inspired by
this observation, we propose a generative prior for hand pose refinement guided
by affordance-aware textual descriptions of hand-object interactions (HOI). Our
method employs a diffusion-based generative model that learns the distribution
of plausible hand poses conditioned on affordance descriptions, which are
inferred from a large vision-language model (VLM). This enables the refinement
of occluded regions into more accurate and functionally coherent hand poses.
Extensive experiments on HOGraspNet, a 3D hand-affordance dataset with severe
occlusions, demonstrate that our affordance-guided refinement significantly
improves hand pose estimation over both recent regression methods and
diffusion-based refinement lacking contextual reasoning.

TL;DR: 提出EPIC框架，通过渐进式一致性蒸馏解决多模态大模型中视觉token压缩带来的学习困难问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉token在多模态大模型中消耗大量计算资源，现有压缩方法忽略了压缩带来的特征空间扰动增加学习难度的问题

Method: 通过分解token压缩引入的特征空间扰动，提出token一致性蒸馏和层一致性蒸馏，利用教师模型指导进行渐进式学习

Result: 实验证明该框架具有优越的有效性、鲁棒性和泛化能力

Conclusion: EPIC框架能有效解决视觉token压缩带来的学习困难，提升多模态大模型效率

Abstract: Visual tokens consume substantial computational resources in multi-modal
large models (MLLMs), significantly compromising their efficiency. Recent works
have attempted to improve efficiency by compressing visual tokens during
training, either through modifications to model components or by introducing
additional parameters. However, they often overlook the increased learning
difficulty caused by such compression, as the model's parameter space struggles
to quickly adapt to the substantial perturbations in the feature space induced
by token compression. In this work, we propose to develop Efficient MLLMs via
Progressive Consistency Distillation (EPIC), a progressive learning framework.
Specifically, by decomposing the feature space perturbations introduced by
token compression along the token-wise and layer-wise dimensions, we introduce
token consistency distillation and layer consistency distillation,
respectively, aiming to reduce the training difficulty by leveraging guidance
from a teacher model and following a progressive learning trajectory. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the superior effectiveness, robustness, and
generalization capabilities of our proposed framework.

*Darya Taratynova,Ahmed Aly,Numan Saeed,Mohammad Yaqub*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CardioBench是一个用于超声心动图基础模型的标准化基准测试，整合了8个公开数据集，涵盖4个回归和5个分类任务，评估了心脏专用、生物医学和通用编码器在不同协议下的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超声心动图基础模型应用有限，缺乏标准化评估基准，现有解决方案多在私有数据上评估，限制了可比性。超声心动图面临噪声采集、高帧冗余和公开数据集有限等独特挑战。

Method: 将8个公开数据集统一为标准套件，涵盖功能、结构、诊断和视图识别等任务。在一致的零样本、探测和对齐协议下评估多种基础模型，包括心脏专用、生物医学和通用编码器。

Result: 不同模型家族展现出互补优势：时序建模对功能回归至关重要，检索在分布偏移下提供鲁棒性，领域特定文本编码器捕获生理学有意义的轴。通用编码器迁移能力强，但在视图分类和细微病理识别方面表现不佳。

Conclusion: CardioBench通过发布预处理、分割和公开评估流程，建立了可复现的参考点，为未来超声心动图基础模型设计提供可操作的见解。

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) are reshaping medical imaging, yet their application
in echocardiography remains limited. While several echocardiography-specific
FMs have recently been introduced, no standardized benchmark exists to evaluate
them. Echocardiography poses unique challenges, including noisy acquisitions,
high frame redundancy, and limited public datasets. Most existing solutions
evaluate on private data, restricting comparability. To address this, we
introduce CardioBench, a comprehensive benchmark for echocardiography FMs.
CardioBench unifies eight publicly available datasets into a standardized suite
spanning four regression and five classification tasks, covering functional,
structural, diagnostic, and view recognition endpoints. We evaluate several
leading FM, including cardiac-specific, biomedical, and general-purpose
encoders, under consistent zero-shot, probing, and alignment protocols. Our
results highlight complementary strengths across model families: temporal
modeling is critical for functional regression, retrieval provides robustness
under distribution shift, and domain-specific text encoders capture
physiologically meaningful axes. General-purpose encoders transfer strongly and
often close the gap with probing, but struggle with fine-grained distinctions
like view classification and subtle pathology recognition. By releasing
preprocessing, splits, and public evaluation pipelines, CardioBench establishes
a reproducible reference point and offers actionable insights to guide the
design of future echocardiography foundation models.

### [34] [Cascaded Diffusion Framework for Probabilistic Coarse-to-Fine Hand Pose Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00527)
*Taeyun Woo,Jinah Park,Tae-Kyun Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种从粗到细的级联扩散框架，结合概率建模与级联细化，用于3D手部姿态重建，有效解决了姿态模糊性和不确定性建模问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有确定性模型难以处理自遮挡和复杂手部关节带来的姿态模糊性，而现有概率方法仅限于单阶段估计且缺乏细化能力，无法实现准确的3D重建。

Method: 采用两阶段级联扩散框架：第一阶段使用联合扩散模型采样多样化的3D关节假设；第二阶段使用网格潜在扩散模型，在关节样本条件下重建3D手部网格。

Result: 在FreiHAND和HO3Dv2数据集上的实验表明，该方法实现了最先进的性能，同时有效建模了姿态分布。

Conclusion: 该框架成功结合了概率建模与级联细化的优势，解决了3D手部姿态重建中的模糊性和不确定性挑战，为准确的手部姿态估计提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Deterministic models for 3D hand pose reconstruction, whether single-staged
or cascaded, struggle with pose ambiguities caused by self-occlusions and
complex hand articulations. Existing cascaded approaches refine predictions in
a coarse-to-fine manner but remain deterministic and cannot capture pose
uncertainties. Recent probabilistic methods model pose distributions yet are
restricted to single-stage estimation, which often fails to produce accurate 3D
reconstructions without refinement. To address these limitations, we propose a
coarse-to-fine cascaded diffusion framework that combines probabilistic
modeling with cascaded refinement. The first stage is a joint diffusion model
that samples diverse 3D joint hypotheses, and the second stage is a Mesh Latent
Diffusion Model (Mesh LDM) that reconstructs a 3D hand mesh conditioned on a
joint sample. By training Mesh LDM with diverse joint hypotheses in a learned
latent space, our framework learns distribution-aware joint-mesh relationships
and robust hand priors. Furthermore, the cascaded design mitigates the
difficulty of directly mapping 2D images to dense 3D poses, enhancing accuracy
through sequential refinement. Experiments on FreiHAND and HO3Dv2 demonstrate
that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance while effectively
modeling pose distributions.

Method: 在YOLOv8基础上集成三项创新：1) SPD-Conv无损下采样模块保留小目标细节；2) CSPOK跨阶段特征融合块增强多尺度特征表示并抑制背景噪声；3) VarifocalLoss训练目标优化，关注高质量和难分类样本。

Result: 在自建的ForestPest数据集上进行的广泛实验表明，Forestpest-YOLO实现了最先进的性能，在检测微小、遮挡害虫方面显著优于现有基线模型。

Conclusion: Forestpest-YOLO框架通过专门针对林业遥感特点的优化设计，有效解决了复杂环境中害虫检测的挑战，为生态保护提供了可靠的技术支持。

Abstract: Detecting agricultural pests in complex forestry environments using remote
sensing imagery is fundamental for ecological preservation, yet it is severely
hampered by practical challenges. Targets are often minuscule, heavily
occluded, and visually similar to the cluttered background, causing
conventional object detection models to falter due to the loss of fine-grained
features and an inability to handle extreme data imbalance. To overcome these
obstacles, this paper introduces Forestpest-YOLO, a detection framework
meticulously optimized for the nuances of forestry remote sensing. Building
upon the YOLOv8 architecture, our framework introduces a synergistic trio of
innovations. We first integrate a lossless downsampling module, SPD-Conv, to
ensure that critical high-resolution details of small targets are preserved
throughout the network. This is complemented by a novel cross-stage feature
fusion block, CSPOK, which dynamically enhances multi-scale feature
representation while suppressing background noise. Finally, we employ
VarifocalLoss to refine the training objective, compelling the model to focus
on high-quality and hard-to-classify samples. Extensive experiments on our
challenging, self-constructed ForestPest dataset demonstrate that
Forestpest-YOLO achieves state-of-the-art performance, showing marked
improvements in detecting small, occluded pests and significantly outperforming
established baseline models.

*Henrik Pichler,Janis Keuper,Matthew Copping*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究表明，在微生物学图像分析任务中，基于少量标注数据微调的视觉基础模型（如MaskDINO）可以达到与需要大量标注数据的传统模型（如YoloV9）相近的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统微生物学图像分析需要大量人工标注数据来训练模型，这过程耗时耗力。本文旨在证明在应对新的视觉任务时，无需进行大量标注即可获得良好性能。

Method: 构建了5000张培养皿图像数据集，模拟传统数据收集方法以及少样本、低样本场景。评估了三种视觉基础模型与传统基线模型在任务特定指标上的表现。

Result: MaskDINO仅用150张图像微调就能达到与大量训练的YoloV9模型相近的性能，仅用25张图像仍能保持竞争力，在约70%的样本上表现可靠。

Conclusion: 数据高效的基础模型仅需传统方法所需数据的一小部分就能达到相似性能，能够更早地开发自动化微生物系统，并具有比传统模型更高的性能上限。

Abstract: The process of quantifying mold colonies on Petri dish samples is of critical
importance for the assessment of indoor air quality, as high colony counts can
indicate potential health risks and deficiencies in ventilation systems.
Conventionally the automation of such a labor-intensive process, as well as
other tasks in microbiology, relies on the manual annotation of large datasets
and the subsequent extensive training of models like YoloV9. To demonstrate
that exhaustive annotation is not a prerequisite anymore when tackling a new
vision task, we compile a representative dataset of 5000 Petri dish images
annotated with bounding boxes, simulating both a traditional data collection
approach as well as few-shot and low-shot scenarios with well curated subsets
with instance level masks. We benchmark three vision foundation models against
traditional baselines on task specific metrics, reflecting realistic real-world
requirements. Notably, MaskDINO attains near-parity with an extensively trained
YoloV9 model while finetuned only on 150 images, retaining competitive
performance with as few as 25 images, still being reliable on $\approx$ 70% of
the samples. Our results show that data-efficient foundation models can match
traditional approaches with only a fraction of the required data, enabling
earlier development and faster iterative improvement of automated
microbiological systems with a superior upper-bound performance than
traditional models would achieve.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了自适应共享专家(ASE)方法，在基于LoRA的MoE框架中引入共享专家，通过路由器计算的门控权重实现从单任务到多任务学习的平滑过渡，提升专家专业化和协作能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的MoE多任务学习方法依赖单任务预训练骨干网络，在从单任务到多任务学习的过渡过程中存在冗余适应和知识共享效率低的问题。

Method: 在基于LoRA的MoE中引入自适应共享专家，共享专家与稀疏专家共同归一化门控权重；通过增加LoRA专家数量同时按比例降低其秩，实现细粒度专家设计。

Result: 在PASCAL-Context基准测试中，ASE方法在各种配置下持续提升性能，验证了细粒度设计对多任务学习的有效性。

Conclusion: ASE方法通过自适应共享专家和细粒度专家设计，有效解决了MoE多任务学习中的知识共享和过渡问题，提升了多任务学习性能。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has emerged as a powerful framework for multi-task
learning (MTL). However, existing MoE-MTL methods often rely on single-task
pretrained backbones and suffer from redundant adaptation and inefficient
knowledge sharing during the transition from single-task to multi-task learning
(STL to MTL). To address these limitations, we propose adaptive shared experts
(ASE) within a low-rank adaptation (LoRA) based MoE, where shared experts are
assigned router-computed gating weights jointly normalized with sparse experts.
This design facilitates STL to MTL transition, enhances expert specialization,
and cooperation. Furthermore, we incorporate fine-grained experts by increasing
the number of LoRA experts while proportionally reducing their rank, enabling
more effective knowledge sharing under a comparable parameter budget. Extensive
experiments on the PASCAL-Context benchmark, under unified training settings,
demonstrate that ASE consistently improves performance across diverse
configurations and validates the effectiveness of fine-grained designs for MTL.

TL;DR: ArbInterp是一个新颖的生成式视频帧插值框架，支持在任意时间戳进行任意长度的帧插值，解决了现有方法只能合成固定数量中间帧的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的生成式视频帧插值方法只能合成固定数量的中间帧，缺乏调整生成帧率或总序列时长的灵活性。

Method: 提出了Timestamp-aware Rotary Position Embedding (TaRoPE)来支持任意时间戳插值，并将长序列生成分解为分段帧合成，采用外观-运动解耦条件策略确保跨段时空连续性。

Result: 实验结果表明，ArbInterp在2x到32x的多尺度帧插值基准测试中优于现有方法，具有更高的保真度和更无缝的时空连续性。

Conclusion: ArbInterp框架成功实现了任意时间戳和任意长度的视频帧插值，为视频生成应用提供了更大的灵活性。

Abstract: Video frame interpolation (VFI), which generates intermediate frames from
given start and end frames, has become a fundamental function in video
generation applications. However, existing generative VFI methods are
constrained to synthesize a fixed number of intermediate frames, lacking the
flexibility to adjust generated frame rates or total sequence duration. In this
work, we present ArbInterp, a novel generative VFI framework that enables
efficient interpolation at any timestamp and of any length. Specifically, to
support interpolation at any timestamp, we propose the Timestamp-aware Rotary
Position Embedding (TaRoPE), which modulates positions in temporal RoPE to
align generated frames with target normalized timestamps. This design enables
fine-grained control over frame timestamps, addressing the inflexibility of
fixed-position paradigms in prior work. For any-length interpolation, we
decompose long-sequence generation into segment-wise frame synthesis. We
further design a novel appearance-motion decoupled conditioning strategy: it
leverages prior segment endpoints to enforce appearance consistency and
temporal semantics to maintain motion coherence, ensuring seamless
spatiotemporal transitions across segments. Experimentally, we build
comprehensive benchmarks for multi-scale frame interpolation (2x to 32x) to
assess generalizability across arbitrary interpolation factors. Results show
that ArbInterp outperforms prior methods across all scenarios with higher
fidelity and more seamless spatiotemporal continuity. Project website:

Conclusion: KeySG通过关键帧增强的分层图表示和分层RAG管道，有效解决了3D场景图的语义限制和可扩展性问题，实现了更通用的任务无关推理和规划。

Abstract: In recent years, 3D scene graphs have emerged as a powerful world
representation, offering both geometric accuracy and semantic richness.
Combining 3D scene graphs with large language models enables robots to reason,
plan, and navigate in complex human-centered environments. However, current
approaches for constructing 3D scene graphs are semantically limited to a
predefined set of relationships, and their serialization in large environments
can easily exceed an LLM's context window. We introduce KeySG, a framework that
represents 3D scenes as a hierarchical graph consisting of floors, rooms,
objects, and functional elements, where nodes are augmented with multi-modal
information extracted from keyframes selected to optimize geometric and visual
coverage. The keyframes allow us to efficiently leverage VLM to extract scene
information, alleviating the need to explicitly model relationship edges
between objects, enabling more general, task-agnostic reasoning and planning.
Our approach can process complex and ambiguous queries while mitigating the
scalability issues associated with large scene graphs by utilizing a
hierarchical retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline to extract relevant
context from the graph. Evaluated across four distinct benchmarks -- including
3D object segmentation and complex query retrieval -- KeySG outperforms prior
approaches on most metrics, demonstrating its superior semantic richness and
efficiency.

that is combined with a contextual prior and a public reputation state updated
via Shapley-based team credit. The result is calibrated, thresholdable
posteriors that (i) amplify agreement among reliable models, (ii) preserve
uniquely correct single-model signals, and (iii) adapt to drift. To specialise
general VLMs, we curate 1,000 real-world dashcam clips with structured
annotations (scene description, manoeuvre recommendation, rationale) via an
automatic pipeline that fuses HDD ground truth, vehicle kinematics, and YOLOv11
+ BoT-SORT tracking, guided by a three-step chain-of-thought prompt; three
heterogeneous VLMs are then fine-tuned with LoRA. We evaluate with Hamming
distance, Micro-Macro-F1, and average per-video latency. Empirically, the
proposed method achieves a 23% reduction in Hamming distance, 55% improvement
in Macro-F1, and 47% improvement in Micro-F1 when comparing with the best
single model, supporting VLM fusion as a calibrated, interpretable, and robust
decision-support component for AV pipelines.

TL;DR: 提出了MDS-NeRF方法，通过重新设计NeRF流程并引入动态风格注入模块，实现多层次的3D风格迁移，支持全视角风格迁移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有NeRF风格迁移方法通常将风格统计信息集成到原始NeRF流程中，导致内容保持和艺术风格化效果都不理想。

Method: 提出多级特征适配器生成多级特征网格表示，动态风格注入模块学习提取相关风格特征并自适应集成到内容模式中，通过多级级联解码器生成最终风格化视图。

Result: 大量实验表明MDS-NeRF在3D风格迁移方面表现优异，能够保持多尺度空间结构同时有效传递风格特征。

Conclusion: MDS-NeRF通过重新设计NeRF流程和创新的动态风格注入模块，实现了高质量的3D风格迁移，并支持使用3D风格参考进行全视角风格迁移。

Abstract: As the application of neural radiance fields (NeRFs) in various 3D vision
tasks continues to expand, numerous NeRF-based style transfer techniques have
been developed. However, existing methods typically integrate style statistics
into the original NeRF pipeline, often leading to suboptimal results in both
content preservation and artistic stylization. In this paper, we present
multi-level dynamic style transfer for NeRFs (MDS-NeRF), a novel approach that
reengineers the NeRF pipeline specifically for stylization and incorporates an
innovative dynamic style injection module. Particularly, we propose a
multi-level feature adaptor that helps generate a multi-level feature grid
representation from the content radiance field, effectively capturing the
multi-scale spatial structure of the scene. In addition, we present a dynamic
style injection module that learns to extract relevant style features and
adaptively integrates them into the content patterns. The stylized multi-level
features are then transformed into the final stylized view through our proposed
multi-level cascade decoder. Furthermore, we extend our 3D style transfer
method to support omni-view style transfer using 3D style references. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that MDS-NeRF achieves outstanding performance for 3D
style transfer, preserving multi-scale spatial structures while effectively
transferring stylistic characteristics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了ADPT框架，利用大型视觉语言模型自动标注结构缺陷，无需人工监督即可生成高质量标注数据集


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决手动标注结构缺陷的高成本和低效率问题，为基础设施安全提供自动化标注解决方案

Method: 集成大型视觉语言模型与语义模式匹配模块，采用迭代自问精炼机制和递归验证过程，使用优化的领域特定提示

Result: 在区分缺陷与非缺陷图像上达到98%准确率，在四类缺陷标注中达到85%-98%准确率（类别平衡），在类别不平衡数据集上达到80%-92%准确率

Conclusion: ADPT框架为高保真数据集构建提供了可扩展且经济高效的解决方案，支持结构损伤评估中的迁移学习和领域适应等下游任务

Abstract: Automated structural defect annotation is essential for ensuring
infrastructure safety while minimizing the high costs and inefficiencies of
manual labeling. A novel agentic annotation framework, Agent-based Defect
Pattern Tagger (ADPT), is introduced that integrates Large Vision-Language
Models (LVLMs) with a semantic pattern matching module and an iterative
self-questioning refinement mechanism. By leveraging optimized domain-specific
prompting and a recursive verification process, ADPT transforms raw visual data
into high-quality, semantically labeled defect datasets without any manual
supervision. Experimental results demonstrate that ADPT achieves up to 98%
accuracy in distinguishing defective from non-defective images, and 85%-98%
annotation accuracy across four defect categories under class-balanced
settings, with 80%-92% accuracy on class-imbalanced datasets. The framework
offers a scalable and cost-effective solution for high-fidelity dataset
construction, providing strong support for downstream tasks such as transfer
learning and domain adaptation in structural damage assessment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言导航中前景和背景的重要性未被充分探索，前景提供语义线索，背景包含空间连接信息

Method: 使用语义增强地标识别分离前景和背景特征，采用共识驱动的在线增强策略，根据指令和导航位置整合两阶段投票结果

Result: 在REVERIE和R2R数据集上提升了基线模型的泛化能力，并达到最先进性能

Conclusion: 前景-背景特征在线增强策略能有效提升视觉语言导航的泛化性能

Abstract: Following language instructions, vision-language navigation (VLN) agents are
tasked with navigating unseen environments. While augmenting multifaceted
visual representations has propelled advancements in VLN, the significance of
foreground and background in visual observations remains underexplored.
Intuitively, foreground regions provide semantic cues, whereas the background
encompasses spatial connectivity information. Inspired on this insight, we
propose a Consensus-driven Online Feature Augmentation strategy (COFA) with
alternative foreground and background features to facilitate the navigable
generalization. Specifically, we first leverage semantically-enhanced landmark
identification to disentangle foreground and background as candidate augmented
features. Subsequently, a consensus-driven online augmentation strategy
encourages the agent to consolidate two-stage voting results on feature
preferences according to diverse instructions and navigational locations.
Experiments on REVERIE and R2R demonstrate that our online
foreground-background augmentation boosts the generalization of baseline and
attains state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: RCOR是一种新颖的视觉识别方法，通过将定位作为识别的组成部分，实现对象中心和上下文感知建模的解耦，然后进行鲁棒的非参数融合，在不牺牲任何一方的情况下同时实现鲁棒性和上下文感知。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准监督学习在视觉识别中往往过度依赖背景信息（捷径学习），限制了模型在真实世界部署中的鲁棒性。现有方法主要通过抑制背景来解决这个问题，但牺牲了上下文信息。

Method: RCOR将定位作为识别的组成部分，解耦对象中心和上下文感知建模，然后进行鲁棒的非参数融合。

Result: RCOR提高了监督模型和VLM在具有域内和域外背景的数据集上的性能，即使在复杂场景（如ImageNet-1k）中也能实现定位先于识别。

Conclusion: 定位先于识别的方法现在在复杂场景中成为可能，RCOR在不牺牲上下文信息的情况下实现了鲁棒性和上下文感知的平衡。

Abstract: In visual recognition, both the object of interest (referred to as
foreground, FG, for simplicity) and its surrounding context (background, BG)
play an important role. However, standard supervised learning often leads to
unintended over-reliance on the BG, known as shortcut learning of spurious
correlations, limiting model robustness in real-world deployment settings. In
the literature, the problem is mainly addressed by suppressing the BG,
sacrificing context information for improved generalization.
  We propose RCOR -- Robust Context-Aware Object Recognition -- the first
approach that jointly achieves robustness and context-awareness without
compromising either. RCOR treats localization as an integral part of
recognition to decouple object-centric and context-aware modelling, followed by
a robust, non-parametric fusion. It improves the performance of both supervised
models and VLM on datasets with both in-domain and out-of-domain BG, even
without fine-tuning. The results confirm that localization before recognition
is now possible even in complex scenes as in ImageNet-1k.

<details>

Motivation: 对抗训练在一步生成中很关键，但GAN训练难以收敛且容易陷入模式崩溃。研究发现条件判别器中的冗余捷径阻碍了有意义的特征提取。

Method: 采用无条件判别器（UCD），强制判别器在没有条件注入的情况下提取更全面和鲁棒的特征，从而为生成器提供更好的监督。

Result: 在ImageNet-64数据集上实现了1.47 FID，超越了StyleGAN-XL和多个最先进的一步扩散模型，性能显著提升且效率高。

Conclusion: UCD方法能与传统GAN理论兼容，可作为插件实现，实验证明其在改善GAN训练收敛和性能方面的有效性。

Abstract: Adversarial training turns out to be the key to one-step generation,
especially for Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and diffusion model
distillation. Yet in practice, GAN training hardly converges properly and
struggles in mode collapse. In this work, we quantitatively analyze the extent
of Nash equilibrium in GAN training, and conclude that redundant shortcuts by
inputting condition in $D$ disables meaningful knowledge extraction. We thereby
propose to employ an unconditional discriminator (UCD), in which $D$ is
enforced to extract more comprehensive and robust features with no condition
injection. In this way, $D$ is able to leverage better knowledge to supervise
$G$, which promotes Nash equilibrium in GAN literature. Theoretical guarantee
on compatibility with vanilla GAN theory indicates that UCD can be implemented
in a plug-in manner. Extensive experiments confirm the significant performance
improvements with high efficiency. For instance, we achieved \textbf{1.47 FID}
on the ImageNet-64 dataset, surpassing StyleGAN-XL and several state-of-the-art
one-step diffusion models. The code will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Fashion image generation has so far focused on narrow tasks such as virtual
try-on, where garments appear in clean studio environments. In contrast,
editorial fashion presents garments through dynamic poses, diverse locations,
and carefully crafted visual narratives. We introduce the task of virtual
fashion photo-shoot, which seeks to capture this richness by transforming
standardized garment images into contextually grounded editorial imagery. To
enable this new direction, we construct the first large-scale dataset of
garment-lookbook pairs, bridging the gap between e-commerce and fashion media.
Because such pairs are not readily available, we design an automated retrieval
pipeline that aligns garments across domains, combining visual-language
reasoning with object-level localization. We construct a dataset with three
garment-lookbook pair accuracy levels: high quality (10,000 pairs), medium
quality (50,000 pairs), and low quality (300,000 pairs). This dataset offers a
foundation for models that move beyond catalog-style generation and toward
fashion imagery that reflects creativity, atmosphere, and storytelling.

Motivation: 现有基于CNN和Transformer的深度伪造检测方法在建模复杂非线性伪造伪迹方面仍有改进空间，需要更有效的检测算法。

Method: 使用KAN替代固定激活函数，引入LAKAN模块利用面部关键点作为结构先验，动态生成KAN内部参数，引导图像编码器关注关键面部区域。

Result: 在多个公开数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法取得了优越的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法成功结合了几何先验与网络学习过程，为深度伪造检测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid development of deepfake generation techniques necessitates robust
face forgery detection algorithms. While methods based on Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) and Transformers are effective, there is still room for
improvement in modeling the highly complex and non-linear nature of forgery
artifacts. To address this issue, we propose a novel detection method based on
the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN). By replacing fixed activation functions
with learnable splines, our KAN-based approach is better suited to this
challenge. Furthermore, to guide the network's focus towards critical facial
areas, we introduce a Landmark-assisted Adaptive Kolmogorov-Arnold Network
(LAKAN) module. This module uses facial landmarks as a structural prior to
dynamically generate the internal parameters of the KAN, creating an
instance-specific signal that steers a general-purpose image encoder towards
the most informative facial regions with artifacts. This core innovation
creates a powerful combination between geometric priors and the network's
learning process. Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets show that
our proposed method achieves superior performance.

Conclusion: ReFlux成功揭示了整流流变换器中概念擦除的脆弱性，为未来更安全的文本到图像模型开发提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have enabled
impressive generative capabilities, but they also raise significant safety
concerns due to the potential to produce harmful or undesirable content. While
concept erasure has been explored as a mitigation strategy, most existing
approaches and corresponding attack evaluations are tailored to Stable
Diffusion (SD) and exhibit limited effectiveness when transferred to
next-generation rectified flow transformers such as Flux. In this work, we
present ReFlux, the first concept attack method specifically designed to assess
the robustness of concept erasure in the latest rectified flow-based T2I
framework. Our approach is motivated by the observation that existing concept
erasure techniques, when applied to Flux, fundamentally rely on a phenomenon
known as attention localization. Building on this insight, we propose a simple
yet effective attack strategy that specifically targets this property. At its
core, a reverse-attention optimization strategy is introduced to effectively
reactivate suppressed signals while stabilizing attention. This is further
reinforced by a velocity-guided dynamic that enhances the robustness of concept
reactivation by steering the flow matching process, and a
consistency-preserving objective that maintains the global layout and preserves
unrelated content. Extensive experiments consistently demonstrate the
effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed attack method, establishing a
reliable benchmark for evaluating the robustness of concept erasure strategies
in rectified flow transformers.

Abstract: Multi-sensor fusion in autonomous vehicles is becoming more common to offer a
more robust alternative for several perception tasks. This need arises from the
unique contribution of each sensor in collecting data: camera-radar fusion
offers a cost-effective solution by combining rich semantic information from
cameras with accurate distance measurements from radar, without incurring
excessive financial costs or overwhelming data processing requirements. Map
segmentation is a critical task for enabling effective vehicle behaviour in its
environment, yet it continues to face significant challenges in achieving high
accuracy and meeting real-time performance requirements. Therefore, this work
presents a novel and efficient map segmentation architecture, using cameras and
radars, in the \acrfull{bev} space. Our model introduces a real-time map
segmentation architecture considering aspects such as high accuracy, per-class
balancing, and inference time. To accomplish this, we use an advanced loss set
together with a new lightweight head to improve the perception results. Our
results show that, with these modifications, our approach achieves results
comparable to large models, reaching 53.5 mIoU, while also setting a new
benchmark for inference time, improving it by 260\% over the strongest baseline

Abstract: Clouds significantly affect the quality of optical satellite images, which
seriously limits their precise application. Recently, deep learning has been
widely applied to cloud detection and has achieved satisfactory results.
However, the lack of distinctive features in thin clouds and the low quality of
training samples limit the cloud detection accuracy of deep learning methods,
leaving space for further improvements. In this paper, we propose a weakly
supervised cloud detection method that combines spectral features and
multi-scale scene-level deep network (SpecMCD) to obtain highly accurate
pixel-level cloud masks. The method first utilizes a progressive training
framework with a multi-scale scene-level dataset to train the multi-scale
scene-level cloud detection network. Pixel-level cloud probability maps are
then obtained by combining the multi-scale probability maps and cloud thickness
map based on the characteristics of clouds in dense cloud coverage and large
cloud-area coverage images. Finally, adaptive thresholds are generated based on
the differentiated regions of the scene-level cloud masks at different scales
and combined with distance-weighted optimization to obtain binary cloud masks.
Two datasets, WDCD and GF1MS-WHU, comprising a total of 60 Gaofen-1
multispectral (GF1-MS) images, were used to verify the effectiveness of the
proposed method. Compared to the other weakly supervised cloud detection
methods such as WDCD and WSFNet, the F1-score of the proposed SpecMCD method
shows an improvement of over 7.82%, highlighting the superiority and potential
of the SpecMCD method for cloud detection under different cloud coverage
conditions.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Align Your Tangent (AYT)的新方法，通过引入流形特征距离(MFD)损失函数来缓解一致性模型训练中的振荡切线问题，显著加速训练并提升样本质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 一致性模型(CMs)虽然能实现一步或两步采样，但需要长时间训练和大批次才能获得有竞争力的样本质量。研究发现CMs在收敛时存在振荡切线问题，即更新方向平行于数据流形而非指向流形。

Method: 提出流形特征距离(MFD)损失函数，该损失能提供流形对齐的切线，使更新方向指向数据流形。该方法称为Align Your Tangent (AYT)。

Result: AYT方法能显著加速CM训练，甚至超越LPIPS指标的性能。同时发现该方法支持极小批次训练而不损害样本质量。

Conclusion: 通过解决振荡切线问题，AYT方法为一致性模型提供了更有效的训练策略，实现了训练加速和质量提升的双重优势。

Abstract: With diffusion and flow matching models achieving state-of-the-art generating
performance, the interest of the community now turned to reducing the inference
time without sacrificing sample quality. Consistency Models (CMs), which are
trained to be consistent on diffusion or probability flow ordinary differential
equation (PF-ODE) trajectories, enable one or two-step flow or diffusion
sampling. However, CMs typically require prolonged training with large batch
sizes to obtain competitive sample quality. In this paper, we examine the
training dynamics of CMs near convergence and discover that CM tangents -- CM
output update directions -- are quite oscillatory, in the sense that they move
parallel to the data manifold, not towards the manifold. To mitigate
oscillatory tangents, we propose a new loss function, called the manifold
feature distance (MFD), which provides manifold-aligned tangents that point
toward the data manifold. Consequently, our method -- dubbed Align Your Tangent
(AYT) -- can accelerate CM training by orders of magnitude and even out-perform
the learned perceptual image patch similarity metric (LPIPS). Furthermore, we
find that our loss enables training with extremely small batch sizes without
compromising sample quality. Code: https://github.com/1202kbs/AYT

Abstract: High-sensitivity clutter filtering is a fundamental step in ultrasound
microvascular imaging. Singular value decomposition (SVD) and robust principal
component analysis (rPCA) are the main clutter filtering strategies. However,
both strategies are limited in feature modeling and tissue-blood flow
separation for high-quality microvascular imaging. Recently, deep
learning-based clutter filtering has shown potential in more thoroughly
separating tissue and blood flow signals. However, the existing supervised
filters face the challenges of interpretability and lack of in-vitro and
in-vivo ground truths. While the interpretability issue can be addressed by
algorithm deep unfolding, the training ground truth remains unsolved. To this
end, this paper proposes an unsupervised unfolded rPCA (U2-rPCA) method that
preserves mathematical interpretability and is insusceptible to learning
labels. Specifically, U2-rPCA is unfolded from an iteratively reweighted least
squares (IRLS) rPCA baseline with intrinsic low-rank and sparse regularization.
A sparse-enhancement unit is added to the network to strengthen its capability
to capture the sparse micro-flow signals. U2-rPCA is like an adaptive filter
that is trained with part of the image sequence and then used for the following
frames. Experimental validations on a in-silico dataset and public in-vivo
datasets demonstrated the outperformance of U2-rPCA when compared with the
SVD-based method, the rPCA baseline, and another deep learning-based filter.
Particularly, the proposed method improved the contrastto-noise ratio (CNR) of
the power Doppler image by 2 dB to 10 dB when compared with other methods.
Furthermore, the effectiveness of the building modules of U2-rPCA was validated
through ablation studies.

Abstract: The intricate morphology of brain vessels poses significant challenges for
automatic segmentation models, which usually focus on a single imaging
modality. However, accurately treating brain-related conditions requires a
comprehensive understanding of the cerebrovascular tree, regardless of the
specific acquisition procedure. Our framework effectively segments brain
arteries and veins in various datasets through image-to-image translation while
avoiding domain-specific model design and data harmonization between the source
and the target domain. This is accomplished by employing disentanglement
techniques to independently manipulate different image properties, allowing
them to move from one domain to another in a label-preserving manner.
Specifically, we focus on manipulating vessel appearances during adaptation
while preserving spatial information, such as shapes and locations, which are
crucial for correct segmentation. Our evaluation effectively bridges large and
varied domain gaps across medical centers, image modalities, and vessel types.
Additionally, we conduct ablation studies on the optimal number of required
annotations and other architectural choices. The results highlight our
framework's robustness and versatility, demonstrating the potential of domain
adaptation methodologies to perform cerebrovascular image segmentation in
multiple scenarios accurately. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个统一几何和概率视角的框架，通过将扩散模型解释为向“好图像”流形的投影机制，构建了新的确定性模型MPPM，并在潜在空间中实现了优于潜在扩散模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成AI方法往往忽视图像的几何结构，仅关注概率方法，且将潜在空间中的概率分布视为无趣或预定义的。本文旨在统一几何和概率视角，揭示扩散模型的几何本质。

Method: 提出了几何框架和基于核的概率方法，将扩散模型解释为向图像流形的投影机制，构建了确定性模型MPPM，可在表示空间和潜在空间中操作。

Result: 潜在MPPM（LMPPM）在多个数据集上优于潜在扩散模型（LDM），在图像恢复和生成方面取得了更优异的结果。

Conclusion: 通过统一几何和概率视角，本文不仅解释了扩散模型的几何本质，还开发了性能更优的新模型，为图像生成提供了新的理论框架。

Abstract: The foundational premise of generative AI for images is the assumption that
images are inherently low-dimensional objects embedded within a
high-dimensional space. Additionally, it is often implicitly assumed that
thematic image datasets form smooth or piecewise smooth manifolds. Common
approaches overlook the geometric structure and focus solely on probabilistic
methods, approximating the probability distribution through universal
approximation techniques such as the kernel method. In some generative models,
the low dimensional nature of the data manifest itself by the introduction of a
lower dimensional latent space. Yet, the probability distribution in the latent
or the manifold coordinate space is considered uninteresting and is predefined
or considered uniform. This study unifies the geometric and probabilistic
perspectives by providing a geometric framework and a kernel-based
probabilistic method simultaneously. The resulting framework demystifies
diffusion models by interpreting them as a projection mechanism onto the
manifold of ``good images''. This interpretation leads to the construction of a
new deterministic model, the Manifold-Probabilistic Projection Model (MPPM),
which operates in both the representation (pixel) space and the latent space.
We demonstrate that the Latent MPPM (LMPPM) outperforms the Latent Diffusion
Model (LDM) across various datasets, achieving superior results in terms of
image restoration and generation.

### [57] [Beyond one-hot encoding? Journey into compact encoding for large multi-class segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00667)
*Aaron Kujawa,Thomas Booth,Tom Vercauteren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出使用二进制编码替代one-hot编码来减少医学图像分割的计算和内存需求，但在108类全脑分割任务中，二进制编码方法的分割性能（DSC 39.3-73.8）低于one-hot编码（DSC 82.4）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准基于学习的方法使用one-hot编码，计算复杂度和内存需求随类别数线性增长。本文旨在通过二进制编码方法将这些需求降低到对数级别，以处理大类别数的医学图像分割任务。

Method: 提出了一系列二进制编码方法，包括普通二进制编码、纠错输出码(ECOC)、类别加权、硬/软解码、类别到码字分配和标签嵌入树，应用于基于3D MRI图像的108类全脑分割任务。

Result: 虽然二进制编码在计算效率上有优势，但在分割质量上表现不佳。相比one-hot编码的DSC 82.4，二进制编码方法只能达到DSC 39.3到73.8的范围，未能达到最先进的分割性能。

Conclusion: 二进制编码在极端分类问题中已被证明有效，但在大类别医学图像分割任务中面临挑战。作者希望这些负面结果能启发未来对紧凑编码策略的研究。

Abstract: This work presents novel methods to reduce computational and memory
requirements for medical image segmentation with a large number of classes. We
curiously observe challenges in maintaining state-of-the-art segmentation
performance with all of the explored options. Standard learning-based methods
typically employ one-hot encoding of class labels. The computational complexity
and memory requirements thus increase linearly with the number of classes. We
propose a family of binary encoding approaches instead of one-hot encoding to
reduce the computational complexity and memory requirements to logarithmic in
the number of classes. In addition to vanilla binary encoding, we investigate
the effects of error-correcting output codes (ECOCs), class weighting,
hard/soft decoding, class-to-codeword assignment, and label embedding trees. We
apply the methods to the use case of whole brain parcellation with 108 classes
based on 3D MRI images. While binary encodings have proven efficient in
so-called extreme classification problems in computer vision, we faced
challenges in reaching state-of-the-art segmentation quality with binary
encodings. Compared to one-hot encoding (Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) =
82.4 (2.8)), we report reduced segmentation performance with the binary
segmentation approaches, achieving DSCs in the range from 39.3 to 73.8.
Informative negative results all too often go unpublished. We hope that this
work inspires future research of compact encoding strategies for large
multi-class segmentation tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于事件-图像知识蒸馏的框架，利用CLIP的语义理解能力，在事件数据上实现开放词汇目标检测，同时设计了混合SNN-CNN框架来避免事件数据分割造成的信息丢失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 事件相机在目标检测中具有高速响应、低延迟和抗运动模糊等优势，但缺乏纹理和颜色信息，使得开放词汇检测特别困难。现有方法通常在预定义类别上训练，难以泛化到新物体。

Method: 使用图像帧作为教师模型的输入，指导基于事件的学生模型学习CLIP的丰富视觉表示。通过空间注意力蒸馏，学生网络直接从原始事件输入中学习有意义的视觉特征。设计了混合SNN-CNN框架，SNN自适应确定最佳事件分割时刻，CNN处理提取的事件特征进行目标检测。

Result: 该方法能够有效桥接事件流和图像之间的模态差距，使事件数据能够继承CLIP的广泛视觉知识，实现开放词汇目标检测。

Conclusion: 提出的知识蒸馏框架和混合SNN-CNN架构成功解决了事件数据开放词汇检测的挑战，避免了传统固定分组事件分割方法造成的关键时间信息丢失问题。

Abstract: Event cameras offer advantages in object detection tasks due to high-speed
response, low latency, and robustness to motion blur. However, event cameras
lack texture and color information, making open-vocabulary detection
particularly challenging. Current event-based detection methods are typically
trained on predefined categories, limiting their ability to generalize to novel
objects, where encountering previously unseen objects is common.
Vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled open-vocabulary object detection in
RGB images. However, the modality gap between images and event streams makes it
ineffective to directly transfer CLIP to event data, as CLIP was not designed
for event streams. To bridge this gap, we propose an event-image knowledge
distillation framework that leverages CLIP's semantic understanding to achieve
open-vocabulary object detection on event data. Instead of training CLIP
directly on event streams, we use image frames as inputs to a teacher model,
guiding the event-based student model to learn CLIP's rich visual
representations. Through spatial attention-based distillation, the student
network learns meaningful visual features directly from raw event inputs while
inheriting CLIP's broad visual knowledge. Furthermore, to prevent information
loss due to event data segmentation, we design a hybrid spiking neural network
(SNN) and convolutional neural network (CNN) framework. Unlike fixed-group
event segmentation methods, which often discard crucial temporal information,
our SNN adaptively determines the optimal event segmentation moments, ensuring
that key temporal features are extracted. The extracted event features are then
processed by CNNs for object detection.

Motivation: 现有的基于原型案例推理的XAI方法通常依赖后处理显著性技术来解释学习到的原型语义，但这些技术的可靠性和质量受到质疑。作者旨在通过图像分割基础模型改进嵌入空间和输入空间映射的真实性。

Method: 使用图像分割基础模型生成分割掩码，利用每个掩码的边界框裁剪图像，每个掩码作为ProtoMask新模型架构中的独立输入，将显著性图计算限制在语义图像块内。

Result: 在三个细粒度分类数据集上的实验表明，该模型具有竞争性的性能表现和独特的可解释性特征。

Conclusion: ProtoMask模型通过结合图像分割基础模型，有效提高了原型案例推理方法的可解释性真实性和可靠性，在保持竞争性能的同时提供了更好的解释能力。

Abstract: XAI gained considerable importance in recent years. Methods based on
prototypical case-based reasoning have shown a promising improvement in
explainability. However, these methods typically rely on additional post-hoc
saliency techniques to explain the semantics of learned prototypes. Multiple
critiques have been raised about the reliability and quality of such
techniques. For this reason, we study the use of prominent image segmentation
foundation models to improve the truthfulness of the mapping between embedding
and input space. We aim to restrict the computation area of the saliency map to
a predefined semantic image patch to reduce the uncertainty of such
visualizations. To perceive the information of an entire image, we use the
bounding box from each generated segmentation mask to crop the image. Each mask
results in an individual input in our novel model architecture named ProtoMask.
We conduct experiments on three popular fine-grained classification datasets
with a wide set of metrics, providing a detailed overview on explainability
characteristics. The comparison with other popular models demonstrates
competitive performance and unique explainability features of our model.

TL;DR: MoE-SGT是一个增强概念瓶颈模型的多模态推理框架，通过图变换器和专家混合模块显式建模概念间的结构化关系，提升复杂概念推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统概念瓶颈模型存在单模态、忽略概念结构化关系的局限性，无法满足高风险领域对可解释性的需求。

Method: 构建答案-概念和答案-问题图来建模多模态输入中的概念关系，集成图变换器捕捉多层次依赖，并用专家混合模块替换前馈层以动态分配推理任务。

Result: 在多个数据集上比其它概念瓶颈网络获得更高准确率，通过建模概念结构化关系和动态专家选择机制显著提升性能。

Conclusion: MoE-SGT通过显式建模概念结构化关系和动态专家分配，有效克服了传统概念瓶颈模型的局限性，在复杂概念推理任务中表现出色。

Abstract: With growing demand for interpretability in deep learning, especially in high
stakes domains, Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) address this by inserting
human understandable concepts into the prediction pipeline, but they are
generally single modal and ignore structured concept relationships. To overcome
these limitations, we present MoE-SGT, a reasoning driven framework that
augments CBMs with a structure injecting Graph Transformer and a Mixture of
Experts (MoE) module. We construct answer-concept and answer-question graphs
for multimodal inputs to explicitly model the structured relationships among
concepts. Subsequently, we integrate Graph Transformer to capture multi level
dependencies, addressing the limitations of traditional Concept Bottleneck
Models in modeling concept interactions. However, it still encounters
bottlenecks in adapting to complex concept patterns. Therefore, we replace the
feed forward layers with a Mixture of Experts (MoE) module, enabling the model
to have greater capacity in learning diverse concept relationships while
dynamically allocating reasoning tasks to different sub experts, thereby
significantly enhancing the model's adaptability to complex concept reasoning.
MoE-SGT achieves higher accuracy than other concept bottleneck networks on
multiple datasets by modeling structured relationships among concepts and
utilizing a dynamic expert selection mechanism.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于MLLM内在不确定性的训练免费框架，通过响应熵值评分候选视觉输入，使模型能自主聚焦最显著数据，在视觉搜索、长视频理解和时序定位任务中达到与专用微调方法相当的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在细粒度感知任务中存在困难，现有方法依赖复杂、任务特定的微调，限制了泛化能力并增加了模型复杂度。

Method: 利用MLLM的内在不确定性作为主动引导信号，通过模型输出熵值来评分候选视觉输入，构建统一的评分机制让模型自主聚焦最相关数据。

Result: 在视觉搜索、长视频理解和时序定位三个复杂视觉任务中，现成的MLLM能够达到与专用微调方法竞争的性能。

Conclusion: 利用内在不确定性是增强多模态细粒度性能的强大通用策略。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) often struggle with fine-grained
perception, such as identifying small objects in high-resolution images or
finding key moments in long videos. Existing works typically rely on
complicated, task-specific fine-tuning, which limits their generalizability and
increases model complexity. In this work, we propose an effective,
training-free framework that uses an MLLM's intrinsic uncertainty as a
proactive guidance signal. Our core insight is that a model's output entropy
decreases when presented with relevant visual information. We introduce a
unified mechanism that scores candidate visual inputs by response uncertainty,
enabling the model to autonomously focus on the most salient data. We apply
this simple principle to three complex visual tasks: Visual Search, Long Video
Understanding, and Temporal Grounding, allowing off-the-shelf MLLMs to achieve
performance competitive with specialized, fine-tuned methods. Our work
validates that harnessing intrinsic uncertainty is a powerful, general strategy
for enhancing fine-grained multimodal performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统配准方法速度慢且对采集变化敏感，限制了定量灌注成像的鲁棒性和可扩展性。

Method: 使用无监督深度学习替代迭代配准，通过三步校正流程和鲁棒主成分分析减少对比度相关影响，同时校正灌注序列和辅助图像。

Result: 显著改善时间强度曲线平滑度，心肌配准效果与基线相当但优于未配准状态，灌注图运动伪影减少，处理时间缩短15倍。

Conclusion: 该深度学习管道实现了快速、鲁棒的运动校正，提高了定量灌注成像的准确性，有望促进临床广泛应用。

Abstract: Background: Quantitative stress perfusion cardiovascular magnetic resonance
(CMR) is a powerful tool for assessing myocardial ischemia. Motion correction
is essential for accurate pixel-wise mapping but traditional registration-based
methods are slow and sensitive to acquisition variability, limiting robustness
and scalability.
  Methods: We developed an unsupervised deep learning-based motion correction
pipeline that replaces iterative registration with efficient one-shot
estimation. The method corrects motion in three steps and uses robust principal
component analysis to reduce contrast-related effects. It aligns the perfusion
series and auxiliary images (arterial input function and proton
density-weighted series). Models were trained and validated on multivendor data
from 201 patients, with 38 held out for testing. Performance was assessed via
temporal alignment and quantitative perfusion values, compared to a previously
published registration-based method.
  Results: The deep learning approach significantly improved temporal
smoothness of time-intensity curves (p<0.001). Myocardial alignment (Dice =
0.92 (0.04) and 0.91 (0.05)) was comparable to the baseline and superior to
before registration (Dice = 0.80 (0.09), p<0.001). Perfusion maps showed
reduced motion, with lower standard deviation in the myocardium (0.52 (0.39)
ml/min/g) compared to baseline (0.55 (0.44) ml/min/g). Processing time was
reduced 15-fold.
  Conclusion: This deep learning pipeline enables fast, robust motion
correction for stress perfusion CMR, improving accuracy across dynamic and
auxiliary images. Trained on multivendor data, it generalizes across sequences
and may facilitate broader clinical adoption of quantitative perfusion imaging.

TL;DR: 该研究使用DEAP数据集中的EEG信号子集，通过连续小波变换将EEG数据转换为尺度图，并训练视觉变换器模型进行情绪分类，仅用12个通道就实现了91.57%的准确率。

Motivation: 传统情绪预测方法如自我评估和面部表情分析存在主观性和模糊性，而完整EEG测量复杂且资源密集。研究旨在探索低成本EEG设备通过减少通道数量仍能实现准确情绪预测的可能性。

Method: 使用连续小波变换将EEG数据转换为尺度图，然后训练视觉变换器模型进行情绪分类，重点测试了仅使用12个EEG通道的效果。

Result: 模型在仅使用12个测量点的情况下，对4个象限（高/低唤醒度和效价）的情绪预测准确率超过91.57%，与使用32个通道的最先进结果96.9%相比表现优异。

Conclusion: 研究表明显著减少输入通道数量仍能获得高准确率，为低成本EEG设备在情绪预测中的应用提供了有力支持。

Abstract: Accurately predicting emotions from brain signals has the potential to
achieve goals such as improving mental health, human-computer interaction, and
affective computing. Emotion prediction through neural signals offers a
promising alternative to traditional methods, such as self-assessment and
facial expression analysis, which can be subjective or ambiguous. Measurements
of the brain activity via electroencephalogram (EEG) provides a more direct and
unbiased data source. However, conducting a full EEG is a complex,
resource-intensive process, leading to the rise of low-cost EEG devices with
simplified measurement capabilities. This work examines how subsets of EEG
channels from the DEAP dataset can be used for sufficiently accurate emotion
prediction with low-cost EEG devices, rather than fully equipped
EEG-measurements. Using Continuous Wavelet Transformation to convert EEG data
into scaleograms, we trained a vision transformer (ViT) model for emotion
classification. The model achieved over 91,57% accuracy in predicting 4
quadrants (high/low per arousal and valence) with only 12 measuring points
(also referred to as channels). Our work shows clearly, that a significant
reduction of input channels yields high results compared to state-of-the-art
results of 96,9% with 32 channels. Training scripts to reproduce our code can

TL;DR: 提出了一种解决极端盲图像恢复(EBIR)问题的新框架，通过将极度低质量(ELQ)到高质量(HQ)的恢复过程分解为两个步骤：首先将ELQ图像投影到中间低质量(LQ)流形，然后使用现成的BIR模型恢复为HQ。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有盲图像恢复方法在处理极端退化情况时表现不佳，直接学习ELQ到HQ的映射面临巨大域差距挑战，容易产生不自然的伪影和细节丢失。

Method: 基于信息论视角，将图像恢复建模为信息瓶颈问题，设计理论驱动的目标函数训练投影器。框架支持推理时提示精炼(LFO)和即插即用增强现有模型。

Result: 在严重退化场景下的广泛实验验证了方法的有效性，能够稳定训练并提升恢复质量。

Conclusion: 该框架通过分解恢复过程有效解决了EBIR问题，为极端退化图像恢复提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Blind Image Restoration (BIR) methods have achieved remarkable success but
falter when faced with Extreme Blind Image Restoration (EBIR), where inputs
suffer from severe, compounded degradations beyond their training scope.
Directly learning a mapping from extremely low-quality (ELQ) to high-quality
(HQ) images is challenging due to the massive domain gap, often leading to
unnatural artifacts and loss of detail. To address this, we propose a novel
framework that decomposes the intractable ELQ-to-HQ restoration process. We
first learn a projector that maps an ELQ image onto an intermediate,
less-degraded LQ manifold. This intermediate image is then restored to HQ using
a frozen, off-the-shelf BIR model. Our approach is grounded in information
theory; we provide a novel perspective of image restoration as an Information
Bottleneck problem and derive a theoretically-driven objective to train our
projector. This loss function effectively stabilizes training by balancing a
low-quality reconstruction term with a high-quality prior-matching term. Our
framework enables Look Forward Once (LFO) for inference-time prompt refinement,
and supports plug-and-play strengthening of existing image restoration models
without need for finetuning. Extensive experiments under severe degradation
regimes provide a thorough analysis of the effectiveness of our work.

Abstract: Non-destructive testing (NDT) is essential in ceramic manufacturing to ensure
the quality of components without compromising their integrity. In this
context, Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) enables high-resolution internal
imaging, revealing defects such as pores, delaminations, or inclusions. This
paper presents an automatic defect detection system based on Deep Learning
(DL), trained on OCT images with manually segmented annotations. A neural
network based on the U-Net architecture is developed, evaluating multiple
experimental configurations to enhance its performance. Post-processing
techniques enable both quantitative and qualitative evaluation of the
predictions. The system shows an accurate behavior of 0.979 Dice Score,
outperforming comparable studies. The inference time of 18.98 seconds per

<details>

Motivation: 当前图像-文本对齐评估缺乏全面基准，现有预测器无法同时满足与人类判断对齐、长序列处理、推理效率和多目标评分等关键要求。

Method: 基于大型视觉语言模型构建插件式架构，通过在预训练LVLM的冻结隐藏状态上训练轻量级岭回归层，实现细粒度的多目标评分。

Result: MULTI-TAP在不同LVLM架构上表现稳健，性能显著优于现有指标，与GPT-4o基预测器G-VEval相当但模型更小（7-8B），在效率和性能上均优于VisionREWARD。

Conclusion: MULTI-TAP为可靠的视觉语言应用开发提供了有效的图像-文本对齐评估工具，新发布的EYE4ALL数据集为开发更易访问的AI系统奠定了基础。

Abstract: Evaluating image-text alignment while reflecting human preferences across
multiple aspects is a significant issue for the development of reliable
vision-language applications. It becomes especially crucial in real-world
scenarios where multiple valid descriptions exist depending on contexts or user
needs. However, research progress is hindered by the lack of comprehensive
benchmarks and existing evaluation predictors lacking at least one of these key
properties: (1) Alignment with human judgments, (2) Long-sequence processing,
(3) Inference efficiency, and (4) Applicability to multi-objective scoring. To
address these challenges, we propose a plug-and-play architecture to build a
robust predictor, MULTI-TAP (Multi-Objective Task-Aware Predictor), capable of
both multi and single-objective scoring. MULTI-TAP can produce a single overall
score, utilizing a reward head built on top of a large vision-language model
(LVLMs). We show that MULTI-TAP is robust in terms of application to different
LVLM architectures, achieving significantly higher performance than existing
metrics and even on par with the GPT-4o-based predictor, G-VEval, with a
smaller size (7-8B). By training a lightweight ridge regression layer on the
frozen hidden states of a pre-trained LVLM, MULTI-TAP can produce fine-grained
scores for multiple human-interpretable objectives. MULTI-TAP performs better
than VisionREWARD, a high-performing multi-objective reward model, in both
performance and efficiency on multi-objective benchmarks and our newly released
text-image-to-text dataset, EYE4ALL. Our new dataset, consisting of
chosen/rejected human preferences (EYE4ALLPref) and human-annotated
fine-grained scores across seven dimensions (EYE4ALLMulti), can serve as a
foundation for developing more accessible AI systems by capturing the
underlying preferences of users, including blind and low-vision (BLV)
individuals.

TL;DR: 提出了一种零查询黑盒对抗攻击方法ZQBA，利用深度神经网络的特征图生成对抗样本，无需多次查询或训练扩散模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有黑盒对抗攻击需要多次查询或训练扩散模型来生成对抗样本，这在现实场景中适用性有限。

Method: 使用DNN获取的特征图添加到干净图像中，以破坏目标模型的分类性能，实现单次查询攻击。

Result: ZQBA能够在不同模型和数据集（CIFAR、Tiny ImageNet）间转移对抗样本，在单次查询下优于现有黑盒攻击方法。

Conclusion: 该方法揭示了DNN在现实应用中的脆弱性，同时保持了扰动的不可感知性。

Abstract: Current black-box adversarial attacks either require multiple queries or
diffusion models to produce adversarial samples that can impair the target
model performance. However, these methods require training a surrogate loss or
diffusion models to produce adversarial samples, which limits their
applicability in real-world settings. Thus, we propose a Zero Query Black-box
Adversarial (ZQBA) attack that exploits the representations of Deep Neural
Networks (DNNs) to fool other networks. Instead of requiring thousands of
queries to produce deceiving adversarial samples, we use the feature maps
obtained from a DNN and add them to clean images to impair the classification
of a target model. The results suggest that ZQBA can transfer the adversarial
samples to different models and across various datasets, namely CIFAR and Tiny
ImageNet. The experiments also show that ZQBA is more effective than
state-of-the-art black-box attacks with a single query, while maintaining the
imperceptibility of perturbations, evaluated both quantitatively (SSIM) and
qualitatively, emphasizing the vulnerabilities of employing DNNs in real-world
contexts. All the source code is available at

Abstract: In the context of image classification, Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs)
first embed images into a set of human-understandable concepts, followed by an
intrinsically interpretable classifier that predicts labels based on these
intermediate representations. While CBMs offer a semantically meaningful and
interpretable classification pipeline, they often sacrifice predictive
performance compared to end-to-end convolutional neural networks. Moreover, the
propagation of uncertainty from concept predictions to final label decisions
remains underexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel uncertainty-aware and
interpretable classifier for the second stage of CBMs. Our method learns a set
of binary class-level concept prototypes and uses the distances between
predicted concept vectors and each class prototype as both a classification
score and a measure of uncertainty. These prototypes also serve as
interpretable classification rules, indicating which concepts should be present
in an image to justify a specific class prediction. The proposed framework
enhances both interpretability and robustness by enabling conformal prediction
for uncertain or outlier inputs based on their deviation from the learned
binary class-level concept prototypes.

TL;DR: 提出了MetaLogic评估框架，通过生成语法不同但语义相同的提示词对，检测文本到图像模型在语义一致性方面的对齐失败问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像模型在输入提示词发生微小语言变化时，难以保持语义一致性，暴露了推理和泛化能力的不足。

Method: 利用蜕变测试生成语义相同的提示词对，直接比较生成的图像对来识别不一致性，无需真实图像作为参考。

Result: 在多个最先进的T2I模型上评估发现，Flux.dev和DALLE-3分别有59%和71%的对齐失败率，揭示了严重的鲁棒性问题。

Conclusion: MetaLogic是一个高效、可扩展且无需真实图像的评估方法，能够发现现有评估指标忽略的细粒度逻辑不一致问题。

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) models, especially diffusion-based
architectures, have significantly improved the visual quality of generated
images. However, these models continue to struggle with a critical limitation:
maintaining semantic consistency when input prompts undergo minor linguistic
variations. Despite being logically equivalent, such prompt pairs often yield
misaligned or semantically inconsistent images, exposing a lack of robustness
in reasoning and generalisation. To address this, we propose MetaLogic, a novel
evaluation framework that detects T2I misalignment without relying on ground
truth images. MetaLogic leverages metamorphic testing, generating image pairs
from prompts that differ grammatically but are semantically identical. By
directly comparing these image pairs, the framework identifies inconsistencies
that signal failures in preserving the intended meaning, effectively diagnosing
robustness issues in the model's logic understanding. Unlike existing
evaluation methods that compare a generated image to a single prompt, MetaLogic
evaluates semantic equivalence between paired images, offering a scalable,
ground-truth-free approach to identifying alignment failures. It categorises
these alignment errors (e.g., entity omission, duplication, positional
misalignment) and surfaces counterexamples that can be used for model debugging
and refinement. We evaluate MetaLogic across multiple state-of-the-art T2I
models and reveal consistent robustness failures across a range of logical
constructs. We find that even the SOTA text-to-image models like Flux.dev and
DALLE-3 demonstrate a 59 percent and 71 percent misalignment rate,
respectively. Our results show that MetaLogic is not only efficient and
scalable, but also effective in uncovering fine-grained logical inconsistencies
that are overlooked by existing evaluation metrics.

Abstract: Building facades represent a significant untapped resource for solar energy
generation in dense urban environments, yet assessing their photovoltaic (PV)
potential remains challenging due to complex geometries and semantic com
ponents. This study introduces SF-SPA (Semantic Facade Solar-PV Assessment), an
automated framework that transforms street-view photographs into quantitative
PV deployment assessments. The approach combines com puter vision and
artificial intelligence techniques to address three key challenges: perspective
distortion correction, semantic understanding of facade elements, and spatial
reasoning for PV layout optimization. Our four-stage pipeline processes images
through geometric rectification, zero-shot semantic segmentation, Large
Language Model (LLM) guided spatial reasoning, and energy simulation.
Validation across 80 buildings in four countries demonstrates ro bust
performance with mean area estimation errors of 6.2% &#177; 2.8% compared to
expert annotations. The auto mated assessment requires approximately 100
seconds per building, a substantial gain in efficiency over manual methods.
Simulated energy yield predictions confirm the method's reliability and
applicability for regional poten tial studies, urban energy planning, and
building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) deployment. Code is available at:

Motivation: 当前视频生成模型产生违反真实世界动力学的物理不一致运动，需要开发能够保持物理一致性的视频生成方法。

Method: 两阶段框架：1）使用视觉语言模型预测粗粒度运动轨迹以保持物理一致性；2）通过基于注意力的机制进行细粒度运动精炼。基于视频跟踪数据构建轨迹预测数据集。

Result: 在UCF-101和MSR-VTT数据集上优于现有方法，分别达到545和539的FVD分数。

Conclusion: TrajVLM-Gen通过物理感知的轨迹引导，有效提升了视频生成的物理一致性和质量。

Abstract: Current video generation models produce physically inconsistent motion that
violates real-world dynamics. We propose TrajVLM-Gen, a two-stage framework for
physics-aware image-to-video generation. First, we employ a Vision Language
Model to predict coarse-grained motion trajectories that maintain consistency
with real-world physics. Second, these trajectories guide video generation
through attention-based mechanisms for fine-grained motion refinement. We build
a trajectory prediction dataset based on video tracking data with realistic
motion patterns. Experiments on UCF-101 and MSR-VTT demonstrate that
TrajVLM-Gen outperforms existing methods, achieving competitive FVD scores of
545 on UCF-101 and 539 on MSR-VTT.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了ADQA基准，用于评估音频描述在长视频片段中的质量，关注视觉欣赏和叙事理解，发现现有自动生成方法远不如人工撰写。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有音频描述评估方法主要针对短片段，且仅与单一参考对比，忽略了AD撰写的主观性。需要更全面的评估框架来反映BLV用户的实际需求。

Method: 通过分析两部独立AD轨道的对齐，量化AD的主观性，并提出ADQA基准，在几分钟长的连贯视频片段上评估AD质量，包含视觉欣赏和叙事理解两类问题。

Result: 研究发现当前AD生成方法在帮助BLV用户理解故事和欣赏视觉细节方面，远落后于人工撰写的AD。

Conclusion: 需要改进AD生成方法以更好地服务BLV用户，并建立了公开排行榜用于持续评估。

Abstract: Audio descriptions (ADs) narrate important visual details in movies, enabling
Blind and Low Vision (BLV) users to understand narratives and appreciate visual
details. Existing works in automatic AD generation mostly focus on few-second
trimmed clips, and evaluate them by comparing against a single ground-truth
reference AD. However, writing ADs is inherently subjective. Through alignment
and analysis of two independent AD tracks for the same movies, we quantify the
subjectivity in when and whether to describe, and what and how to highlight.
Thus, we show that working with trimmed clips is inadequate. We propose ADQA, a
QA benchmark that evaluates ADs at the level of few-minute long, coherent video
segments, testing whether they would help BLV users understand the story and
appreciate visual details. ADQA features visual appreciation (VA) questions
about visual facts and narrative understanding (NU) questions based on the
plot. Through ADQA, we show that current AD generation methods lag far behind
human-authored ADs. We conclude with several recommendations for future work
and introduce a public leaderboard for benchmarking.

Motivation: 现有的短语定位研究主要局限于单视图图像，忽略了立体视觉中丰富的几何线索。

Method: 基于PhraseCut数据集，利用GenStereo从现有单视图数据生成准确的右视图图像，将短语定位扩展到立体领域。

Result: 创建了包含立体图像对、对齐分割掩码和短语注释的PhraseStereo数据集，为语言、视觉和3D感知交叉研究奠定基础。

Conclusion: PhraseStereo为开发能够同时推理语义和几何的模型提供了新的研究基础，鼓励多模态学习利用深度线索进行更精确的上下文感知定位。

Abstract: Understanding how natural language phrases correspond to specific regions in
images is a key challenge in multimodal semantic segmentation. Recent advances
in phrase grounding are largely limited to single-view images, neglecting the
rich geometric cues available in stereo vision. For this, we introduce
PhraseStereo, the first novel dataset that brings phrase-region segmentation to
stereo image pairs. PhraseStereo builds upon the PhraseCut dataset by
leveraging GenStereo to generate accurate right-view images from existing
single-view data, enabling the extension of phrase grounding into the stereo
domain. This new setting introduces unique challenges and opportunities for
multimodal learning, particularly in leveraging depth cues for more precise and
context-aware grounding. By providing stereo image pairs with aligned
segmentation masks and phrase annotations, PhraseStereo lays the foundation for
future research at the intersection of language, vision, and 3D perception,
encouraging the development of models that can reason jointly over semantics
and geometry. The PhraseStereo dataset will be released online upon acceptance
of this work.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出NSARM框架，使用视觉自回归模型进行真实图像超分辨率，通过两阶段训练实现高质量、高效率的超分辨率重建，并显著提升对输入图像质量的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有真实图像超分辨率方法存在效率与质量的权衡问题：基于扩散模型的方法要么速度慢但质量高，要么速度快但质量低，且对输入图像退化程度敏感。

Method: 基于视觉自回归模型的下一尺度预测策略，采用两阶段训练：首先训练转换网络将低质量图像映射到初步尺度，然后进行端到端全模型微调。

Result: NSARM在定量和定性评估中均优于现有真实图像超分辨率方法，保持快速推理速度的同时，对输入图像质量具有更高的鲁棒性和更强的泛化性能。

Conclusion: NSARM作为纯自回归模型，在真实图像超分辨率任务中实现了优越的视觉效果和鲁棒性，展示了自回归模型在该领域的潜力。

Abstract: Most recent real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) methods employ
pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models to synthesize the high-quality
image either from random Gaussian noise, which yields realistic results but is
slow due to iterative denoising, or directly from the input low-quality image,
which is efficient but at the price of lower output quality. These approaches
train ControlNet or LoRA modules while keeping the pre-trained model fixed,
which often introduces over-enhanced artifacts and hallucinations, suffering
from the robustness to inputs of varying degradations. Recent visual
autoregressive (AR) models, such as pre-trained Infinity, can provide strong
T2I generation capabilities while offering superior efficiency by using the
bitwise next-scale prediction strategy. Building upon next-scale prediction, we
introduce a robust Real-ISR framework, namely Next-Scale Autoregressive
Modeling (NSARM). Specifically, we train NSARM in two stages: a transformation
network is first trained to map the input low-quality image to preliminary
scales, followed by an end-to-end full-model fine-tuning. Such a comprehensive
fine-tuning enhances the robustness of NSARM in Real-ISR tasks without
compromising its generative capability. Extensive quantitative and qualitative
evaluations demonstrate that as a pure AR model, NSARM achieves superior visual
results over existing Real-ISR methods while maintaining a fast inference
speed. Most importantly, it demonstrates much higher robustness to the quality
of input images, showing stronger generalization performance. Project page:

Motivation: 传统分类方法往往忽略不同层次类别间的内在关系，错失了重要的监督信号，因此需要开发能够显式建模层次间关系的方法。

Method: 提出了两种层次对比学习方法：G-HMLC使用高斯混合模型，A-HMLC使用注意力机制来捕获层次特定特征，模仿人类处理方式，显式建模类别间关系和层次间不平衡分布。

Result: 在CIFAR100和ModelNet40数据集上，该方法在线性评估中达到了最先进的性能，比现有的层次对比学习方法在准确率上高出2个百分点。

Conclusion: 该方法通过显式建模层次间关系和类别分布，实现了在所有层次级别上的细粒度聚类，在计算机视觉等领域具有应用潜力。

Abstract: Hierarchical classification is a crucial task in many applications, where
objects are organized into multiple levels of categories. However, conventional
classification approaches often neglect inherent inter-class relationships at
different hierarchy levels, thus missing important supervisory signals. Thus,
we propose two novel hierarchical contrastive learning (HMLC) methods. The
first, leverages a Gaussian Mixture Model (G-HMLC) and the second uses an
attention mechanism to capture hierarchy-specific features (A-HMLC), imitating
human processing. Our approach explicitly models inter-class relationships and
imbalanced class distribution at higher hierarchy levels, enabling fine-grained
clustering across all hierarchy levels. On the competitive CIFAR100 and
ModelNet40 datasets, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in linear
evaluation, outperforming existing hierarchical contrastive learning methods by
2 percentage points in terms of accuracy. The effectiveness of our approach is
backed by both quantitative and qualitative results, highlighting its potential
for applications in computer vision and beyond.

Motivation: 探索生成式世界模型是否能替代传统视觉编码器范式，用于通用多模态理解，特别是研究世界模型先验转移到视觉语言模型中的能力。

Method: 重新利用视频扩散模型作为生成编码器，执行单步去噪操作，将得到的潜在表示作为视觉嵌入，开发了名为Dynamic Vision Aligner (DyVA)的最佳变体。

Result: DyVA在视觉推理任务中超越了开源和专有基线，达到最先进或相当的性能，特别是在空间推理能力方面表现突出。

Conclusion: WorldLMs继承了视频预训练的运动一致性内部化特性，为利用世界模型先验的新一代视觉语言模型指明了方向。

Abstract: Trained on internet-scale video data, generative world models are
increasingly recognized as powerful world simulators that can generate
consistent and plausible dynamics over structure, motion, and physics. This
raises a natural question: with the advent of strong video foundational models,
might they supplant conventional vision encoder paradigms for general-purpose
multimodal understanding? While recent studies have begun to explore the
potential of world models on common vision tasks, these explorations typically
lack a systematic investigation of generic, multimodal tasks. In this work, we
strive to investigate the capabilities when world model priors are transferred
into Vision-Language Models: we re-purpose a video diffusion model as a
generative encoder to perform a single denoising step and treat the resulting
latents as a set of visual embedding. We empirically investigate this class of
models, which we refer to as World-Language Models (WorldLMs), and we find that
generative encoders can capture latents useful for downstream understanding
that show distinctions from conventional encoders. Naming our best-performing
variant Dynamic Vision Aligner (DyVA), we further discover that this method
significantly enhances spatial reasoning abilities and enables single-image
models to perform multi-frame reasoning. Through the curation of a suite of
visual reasoning tasks, we find DyVA to surpass both open-source and
proprietary baselines, achieving state-of-the-art or comparable performance. We
attribute these gains to WorldLM's inherited motion-consistency internalization
from video pre-training. Finally, we systematically explore extensive model
designs to highlight promising directions for future work. We hope our study
can pave the way for a new family of VLMs that leverage priors from world
models and are on a promising path towards generalist vision learners.

Motivation: 传统基于RNN的VSR方法存在梯度消失、缺乏并行性和推理速度慢的问题；Mamba虽然提供线性复杂度的时间建模，但缺乏空间上下文聚合能力。

Method: 结合移位窗口自注意力进行空间上下文聚合，使用Mamba进行高效时间传播，并引入Gather-Scatter Mamba机制进行特征对齐。

Result: 提出的GSMamba架构有效解决了遮挡伪影，实现了跨帧信息的有效重分布。

Conclusion: GSMamba结合了Mamba的时间建模优势和自注意力的空间聚合能力，为视频超分辨率提供了高效的解决方案。

Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs)-most notably RNNs-have historically played a
central role in sequential modeling. Although attention mechanisms such as
Transformers have since dominated due to their ability to model global context,
their quadratic complexity and limited scalability make them less suited for
long sequences. Video super-resolution (VSR) methods have traditionally relied
on recurrent architectures to propagate features across frames. However, such
approaches suffer from well-known issues including vanishing gradients, lack of
parallelism, and slow inference speed. Recent advances in selective SSMs like
Mamba offer a compelling alternative: by enabling input-dependent state
transitions with linear-time complexity, Mamba mitigates these issues while
maintaining strong long-range modeling capabilities. Despite this potential,
Mamba alone struggles to capture fine-grained spatial dependencies due to its
causal nature and lack of explicit context aggregation. To address this, we
propose a hybrid architecture that combines shifted window self-attention for
spatial context aggregation with Mamba-based selective scanning for efficient
temporal propagation. Furthermore, we introduce Gather-Scatter Mamba (GSM), an
alignment-aware mechanism that warps features toward a center anchor frame
within the temporal window before Mamba propagation and scatters them back
afterward, effectively reducing occlusion artifacts and ensuring effective
redistribution of aggregated information across all frames. The official
implementation is provided at: https://github.com/Ko-Lani/GSMamba.

Conclusion: AI-CNet3D模型通过解剖学信息的交叉注意力网络，在保持高诊断性能的同时显著提高了计算效率，为青光眼诊断提供了有效的3D OCT分析方法。

Abstract: Glaucoma is a progressive eye disease that leads to optic nerve damage,
causing irreversible vision loss if left untreated. Optical coherence
tomography (OCT) has become a crucial tool for glaucoma diagnosis, offering
high-resolution 3D scans of the retina and optic nerve. However, the
conventional practice of condensing information from 3D OCT volumes into 2D
reports often results in the loss of key structural details. To address this,
we propose a novel hybrid deep learning model that integrates cross-attention
mechanisms into a 3D convolutional neural network (CNN), enabling the
extraction of critical features from the superior and inferior hemiretinas, as
well as from the optic nerve head (ONH) and macula, within OCT volumes. We
introduce Channel Attention REpresentations (CAREs) to visualize
cross-attention outputs and leverage them for consistency-based multi-task
fine-tuning, aligning them with Gradient-Weighted Class Activation Maps
(Grad-CAMs) from the CNN's final convolutional layer to enhance performance,
interpretability, and anatomical coherence. We have named this model AI-CNet3D
(AI-`See'-Net3D) to reflect its design as an Anatomically-Informed
Cross-attention Network operating on 3D data. By dividing the volume along two
axes and applying cross-attention, our model enhances glaucoma classification
by capturing asymmetries between the hemiretinal regions while integrating
information from the optic nerve head and macula. We validate our approach on
two large datasets, showing that it outperforms state-of-the-art attention and
convolutional models across all key metrics. Finally, our model is
computationally efficient, reducing the parameter count by one-hundred--fold
compared to other attention mechanisms while maintaining high diagnostic
performance and comparable GFLOPS.

Motivation: 医学影像迁移学习中源数据集的选择通常依赖研究者直觉而非系统原则，这会影响算法的泛化能力和患者治疗效果。

Method: 采用以人为中心的HCI视角，通过任务型调查问卷研究机器学习从业者如何选择源数据集。

Conclusion: 需要更清晰的定义和HCI工具来明确这些启发式方法，为迁移学习中更系统的源选择提供实用见解。

Abstract: Transfer learning is crucial for medical imaging, yet the selection of source
datasets - which can impact the generalizability of algorithms, and thus
patient outcomes - often relies on researchers' intuition rather than
systematic principles. This study investigates these decisions through a
task-based survey with machine learning practitioners. Unlike prior work that
benchmarks models and experimental setups, we take a human-centered HCI
perspective on how practitioners select source datasets. Our findings indicate
that choices are task-dependent and influenced by community practices, dataset
properties, and computational (data embedding), or perceived visual or semantic
similarity. However, similarity ratings and expected performance are not always
aligned, challenging a traditional "more similar is better" view. Participants
often used ambiguous terminology, which suggests a need for clearer definitions
and HCI tools to make them explicit and usable. By clarifying these heuristics,
this work provides practical insights for more systematic source selection in
transfer learning.

Motivation: 手动标注3D面部扫描的解剖标志点耗时且依赖专业知识，而现有深度学习方法大多关注伪标志点或需要复杂输入表示，限制了临床适用性。

Method: 结合粗对齐、感兴趣区域过滤和初始标志点近似，使用基于补丁的点状CNN并增强注意力机制。

Conclusion: PAL-Net提供了一个轻量级、可扩展的高通量3D人体测量分析解决方案，有潜力支持临床工作流程并减少对人工标注的依赖。

Abstract: Manual annotation of anatomical landmarks on 3D facial scans is a
time-consuming and expertise-dependent task, yet it remains critical for
clinical assessments, morphometric analysis, and craniofacial research. While
several deep learning methods have been proposed for facial landmark
localization, most focus on pseudo-landmarks or require complex input
representations, limiting their clinical applicability. This study presents a
fully automated deep learning pipeline (PAL-Net) for localizing 50 anatomical
landmarks on stereo-photogrammetry facial models. The method combines coarse
alignment, region-of-interest filtering, and an initial approximation of
landmarks with a patch-based pointwise CNN enhanced by attention mechanisms.
Trained and evaluated on 214 annotated scans from healthy adults, PAL-Net
achieved a mean localization error of 3.686 mm and preserves relevant
anatomical distances with a 2.822 mm average error, comparable to
intra-observer variability. To assess generalization, the model was further
evaluated on 700 subjects from the FaceScape dataset, achieving a point-wise
error of 0.41\,mm and a distance-wise error of 0.38\,mm. Compared to existing
methods, PAL-Net offers a favorable trade-off between accuracy and
computational cost. While performance degrades in regions with poor mesh
quality (e.g., ears, hairline), the method demonstrates consistent accuracy
across most anatomical regions. PAL-Net generalizes effectively across datasets
and facial regions, outperforming existing methods in both point-wise and
structural evaluations. It provides a lightweight, scalable solution for
high-throughput 3D anthropometric analysis, with potential to support clinical
workflows and reduce reliance on manual annotation. Source code can be found at

Abstract: Self-supervised learning for inverse problems allows to train a

have the potential of enabling learning-based solutions when obtaining

of reconstruction networks, and show that the combination of self-supervised
splitting losses and equivariant reconstruction networks results in unbiased
estimates of the supervised loss. Through a series of experiments on image
inpainting, accelerated magnetic resonance imaging, and compressive sensing, we
demonstrate that the proposed loss achieves state-of-the-art performance in
settings with highly rank-deficient forward models.

Motivation: 监控场景中相机距离变化导致行人图像分辨率差异显著，使得低分辨率图像难以与高分辨率图像匹配，限制了行人重识别性能。现有方法依赖超分辨率或联合学习，增加了复杂度且性能遇到瓶颈。

Method: 基于语义方向在特征空间中的发现，提出向量平移特征对齐框架，通过建模分辨率特定特征差异来进行跨分辨率行人重识别。

Result: 在多个跨分辨率行人重识别基准测试中，该方法显著优于先前的最先进基线模型，同时获得更高的效率。

Conclusion: 基于新发现的语义方向在特征空间中的存在，提出的轻量级框架在跨分辨率行人重识别任务中表现出有效性和优越性。

Abstract: In surveillance scenarios, varying camera distances cause significant
differences among pedestrian image resolutions, making it hard to match
low-resolution (LR) images with high-resolution (HR) counterparts, limiting the
performance of Re-Identification (ReID) tasks. Most existing Cross-Resolution
ReID (CR-ReID) methods rely on super-resolution (SR) or joint learning for
feature compensation, which increases training and inference complexity and has
reached a performance bottleneck in recent studies. Inspired by semantic
directions in the word embedding space, we empirically discover that semantic
directions implying resolution differences also emerge in the feature space of
ReID, and we substantiate this finding from a statistical perspective using
Canonical Correlation Analysis and Pearson Correlation Analysis. Based on this
interesting finding, we propose a lightweight and effective Vector Panning
Feature Alignment (VPFA) framework, which conducts CR-ReID from a novel
perspective of modeling the resolution-specific feature discrepancy. Extensive
experimental results on multiple CR-ReID benchmarks show that our method
significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art baseline models while
obtaining higher efficiency, demonstrating the effectiveness and superiority of
our model based on the new finding in this paper.

*Ziqing Zhang,Kai Liu,Zheng Chen,Xi Li,Yucong Chen,Bingnan Duan,Linghe Kong,Yulun Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InfVSR提出了一种自回归单步扩散范式，用于解决长视频超分辨率中的效率和可扩展性问题，实现了流式推理并充分利用预训练视频扩散先验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频超分辨率方法在处理长序列时面临两个主要挑战：多步去噪导致效率低下，以及时间分解导致伪影和不连续性。

Method: 将预训练DiT调整为因果结构，通过滚动KV缓存和联合视觉引导保持局部和全局一致性；将扩散过程蒸馏为单步，采用块状像素监督和跨块分布匹配。

Result: 该方法在长视频超分辨率中达到最先进质量，语义一致性增强，相比MGLD-VSR等方法实现高达58倍加速。

Conclusion: InfVSR突破了长视频超分辨率的限制，实现了高效可扩展的无界长度视频处理，并建立了专门的长视频评估基准。

Abstract: Real-world videos often extend over thousands of frames. Existing video
super-resolution (VSR) approaches, however, face two persistent challenges when
processing long sequences: (1) inefficiency due to the heavy cost of multi-step
denoising for full-length sequences; and (2) poor scalability hindered by
temporal decomposition that causes artifacts and discontinuities. To break
these limits, we propose InfVSR, which novelly reformulates VSR as an
autoregressive-one-step-diffusion paradigm. This enables streaming inference
while fully leveraging pre-trained video diffusion priors. First, we adapt the
pre-trained DiT into a causal structure, maintaining both local and global
coherence via rolling KV-cache and joint visual guidance. Second, we distill
the diffusion process into a single step efficiently, with patch-wise pixel
supervision and cross-chunk distribution matching. Together, these designs
enable efficient and scalable VSR for unbounded-length videos. To fill the gap
in long-form video evaluation, we build a new benchmark tailored for extended
sequences and further introduce semantic-level metrics to comprehensively
assess temporal consistency. Our method pushes the frontier of long-form VSR,
achieves state-of-the-art quality with enhanced semantic consistency, and
delivers up to 58x speed-up over existing methods such as MGLD-VSR. Code will
be available at https://github.com/Kai-Liu001/InfVSR.

TL;DR: JEPA-T是一个统一的多模态框架，通过联合嵌入预测Transformer将图像和文本编码为离散标记，在特征预测后加入交叉注意力进行条件去噪，同时在训练中注入原始文本嵌入以改善对齐效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代文本到图像生成主要依赖基于标记的架构，但文本与视觉标记的有效融合仍然是一个挑战。

Method: 提出JEPA-T框架：将图像和文本编码为离散标记，使用联合嵌入预测Transformer处理；在特征预测后加入交叉注意力进行条件去噪；在流匹配损失前注入原始文本嵌入以改善对齐；同一网络在推理时执行类条件和自由文本图像生成。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K上的评估显示，JEPA-T实现了强大的数据效率、开放词汇泛化能力，并持续优于非融合和后期融合基线。

Conclusion: 后期架构融合与目标级对齐相结合，在基于标记的文本到图像生成中提供了条件强度与骨干通用性之间的有效平衡。

Abstract: Modern Text-to-Image (T2I) generation increasingly relies on token-centric
architectures that are trained with self-supervision, yet effectively fusing
text with visual tokens remains a challenge. We propose \textbf{JEPA-T}, a
unified multimodal framework that encodes images and captions into discrete
visual and textual tokens, processed by a joint-embedding predictive
Transformer. To enhance fusion, we incorporate cross-attention after the
feature predictor for conditional denoising while maintaining a task-agnostic
backbone. Additionally, raw texts embeddings are injected prior to the flow
matching loss to improve alignment during training. During inference, the same
network performs both class-conditional and free-text image generation by
iteratively denoising visual tokens conditioned on text. Evaluations on
ImageNet-1K demonstrate that JEPA-T achieves strong data efficiency,
open-vocabulary generalization, and consistently outperforms non-fusion and
late-fusion baselines. Our approach shows that late architectural fusion
combined with objective-level alignment offers an effective balance between
conditioning strength and backbone generality in token-based T2I.The code is
now available: https://github.com/justin-herry/JEPA-T.git

TL;DR: FastForward是一种单次前向传播的视觉定位方法，能够在无需长时间建图的情况下，通过查询图像与场景特征之间的对应关系快速估计相机位姿。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法即使从已知相机位姿的图像开始建图，在最坏情况下仍需数小时，最好情况也需要数分钟。本研究旨在探索是否能在更短时间内达到竞争性精度。

Method: 将多张建图图像表示为3D空间中锚定的特征集合，利用这些建图特征预测查询图像与场景的对应关系，从而估计相机位姿。结合图像检索技术。

Result: 与需要最少建图准备时间的其他方法相比，达到了最先进的精度。在未见过的领域（包括具有挑战性的大规模室外环境）表现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: FastForward实现了快速、准确的视觉定位，仅需单次前向传播即可完成建图和重定位，显著减少了建图时间要求。

Abstract: Visually localizing an image, i.e., estimating its camera pose, requires
building a scene representation that serves as a visual map. The representation
we choose has direct consequences towards the practicability of our system.
Even when starting from mapping images with known camera poses,
state-of-the-art approaches still require hours of mapping time in the worst
case, and several minutes in the best. This work raises the question whether we
can achieve competitive accuracy much faster. We introduce FastForward, a
method that creates a map representation and relocalizes a query image
on-the-fly in a single feed-forward pass. At the core, we represent multiple
mapping images as a collection of features anchored in 3D space. FastForward
utilizes these mapping features to predict image-to-scene correspondences for
the query image, enabling the estimation of its camera pose. We couple
FastForward with image retrieval and achieve state-of-the-art accuracy when
compared to other approaches with minimal map preparation time. Furthermore,
FastForward demonstrates robust generalization to unseen domains, including
challenging large-scale outdoor environments.

Motivation: 自回归模型在序列建模中表现出色，但视觉信号的空间特性与下一标记预测的顺序依赖性存在冲突，导致次优结果。

Method: 设计了一个精炼模块，利用标记间的全局上下文和关系，在共享顺序预测框架下联合优化所有生成的视觉序列标记。

Result: 实验表明该方法提高了生成质量，增强了模型产生语义一致结果的能力。

Conclusion: 该精炼模块有效缓解了顺序生成中的错误累积问题，提升了视觉-语言建模性能。

Abstract: Autoregressive models excel in sequential modeling and have proven to be
effective for vision-language data. However, the spatial nature of visual
signals conflicts with the sequential dependencies of next-token prediction,
leading to suboptimal results. This work proposes a plug-and-play refinement
module to enhance the complex spatial correspondence modeling within the
generated visual sequence. This module operates as a post-pretraining step to
jointly refine all generated tokens of autoregressive model, enhancing
vision-language modeling under a shared sequential prediction framework. By
leveraging global context and relationship across the tokens, our method
mitigates the error accumulation issue within the sequential generation.
Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method improves the generation
quality, enhancing the model's ability to produce semantically consistent
results.

TL;DR: 提出了SoftCFG方法，通过不确定性引导的推理机制解决AR图像生成中CFG的指导衰减和过度指导问题，在无需训练的情况下显著提升图像质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归模型在图像生成中面临CFG的两个关键问题：指导衰减（条件-无条件差距快速消失）和过度指导（强条件破坏视觉连贯性）

Method: SoftCFG通过让每个生成的token贡献确定性加权的指导，在序列中分布自适应扰动；引入Step Normalization来限制累积扰动，稳定长序列生成

Result: 实验显示SoftCFG显著优于标准CFG，在ImageNet 256上达到自回归模型中最先进的FID分数

Conclusion: SoftCFG是一种无需训练、模型无关的方法，能无缝集成到现有AR流程中，有效解决CFG在AR模型中的应用问题

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models have emerged as powerful tools for image
generation by modeling images as sequences of discrete tokens. While
Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) has been adopted to improve conditional
generation, its application in AR models faces two key issues: guidance
diminishing, where the conditional-unconditional gap quickly vanishes as
decoding progresses, and over-guidance, where strong conditions distort visual
coherence. To address these challenges, we propose SoftCFG, an
uncertainty-guided inference method that distributes adaptive perturbations
across all tokens in the sequence. The key idea behind SoftCFG is to let each
generated token contribute certainty-weighted guidance, ensuring that the
signal persists across steps while resolving conflicts between text guidance
and visual context. To further stabilize long-sequence generation, we introduce
Step Normalization, which bounds cumulative perturbations of SoftCFG. Our
method is training-free, model-agnostic, and seamlessly integrates with
existing AR pipelines. Experiments show that SoftCFG significantly improves
image quality over standard CFG and achieves state-of-the-art FID on ImageNet
256 among autoregressive models.

TL;DR: TextCAM是一个新的解释框架，通过将CAM与视觉语言模型结合，用自然语言丰富CAM解释，同时提供空间定位和语义理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CAM及其变体虽然能突出显示驱动预测的空间区域，但缺乏对这些激活背后属性的语义洞察，限制了在关键应用中的可信度。

Method: 结合CAM的精确空间定位和视觉语言模型的语义对齐，使用CLIP嵌入和线性判别分析获得通道级语义表示，并与CAM权重聚合生成文本描述。

Result: 在ImageNet、CLEVR和CUB上的实验表明，TextCAM能产生忠实且可解释的推理，提高人类理解，检测虚假相关性，并保持模型保真度。

Conclusion: TextCAM通过联合指定模型关注的位置和可能支持其决策的视觉属性，提供了更丰富的解释能力。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved remarkable success across domains
but remain difficult to interpret, limiting their trustworthiness in
high-stakes applications. This paper focuses on deep vision models, for which a
dominant line of explainability methods are Class Activation Mapping (CAM) and
its variants working by highlighting spatial regions that drive predictions. We
figure out that CAM provides little semantic insight into what attributes
underlie these activations. To address this limitation, we propose TextCAM, a
novel explanation framework that enriches CAM with natural languages. TextCAM
combines the precise spatial localization of CAM with the semantic alignment of
vision-language models (VLMs). Specifically, we derive channel-level semantic
representations using CLIP embeddings and linear discriminant analysis, and
aggregate them with CAM weights to produce textual descriptions of salient
visual evidence. This yields explanations that jointly specify where the model
attends and what visual attributes likely support its decision. We further
extend TextCAM to generate feature channels into semantically coherent groups,
enabling more fine-grained visual-textual explanations. Experiments on
ImageNet, CLEVR, and CUB demonstrate that TextCAM produces faithful and
interpretable rationales that improve human understanding, detect spurious
correlations, and preserve model fidelity.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: POVQA提出了一种数据高效的方法，通过时间池化将每秒视频压缩为单帧图像，并使用轻量级监督对齐大型视觉语言模型，显著提升了视频问答性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频问答系统虽然支持1500+帧的长上下文，但仅对应50秒视频，信息损失严重。需要更高效的方法来处理长视频内容。

Method: 使用混合模糊、加权平均、指数和斜坡池化等时间池化技术构建1fps输入，在ReasonVQA数据集上对QWEN-2.5-VL 7B进行监督微调和直接偏好优化。

Result: 在ReasonVQA数据集上，F1分数从0.212提升至0.543，BLEU-4从0.031提升至0.291，ROUGE-L从0.196提升至0.528，推理质量显著提高。

Conclusion: 该方法在不同池化方案下均保持性能提升，表明在时间证据总结方面具有强鲁棒性，在TVQA的零样本测试中也观察到类似结果。

Abstract: Video Question Answering (VQA) with Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) has
gained significant traction in research ever since the Flamingo was introduced
by Deepmind. Recent advancements in large context/long video question answering
have allowed VQA tasks to have context window of 1500+ frames. However, this
only leads to 50 seconds of video footage without losing any significant
information. We introduce POVQA, a data-efficient pipeline that compresses each
second of video into a single temporally pooled image (via motion blur and
weighted averaging variants) and then align LVLMs with lightweight supervision.
Concretely, we build 1 fps input sources using Blend Blur with Last Frame,
Weighted Average, Exponential and Ramp pooling and fine-tune QWEN-2.5-VL 7B
with supervised two turn target including reasoning and final answer. We apply
Supervised Fine Tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) on our
novel dataset ReasonVQA consisting of 12 movies with 239 human annotated
question-answer with reasoning prompts. On our ReasonVQA dataset, this method
dramatically improves performance over pooled baselines: F1 score improves from
0.212 to 0.543, BLEU-4 from 0.031 to 0.291, and ROUGE-L from 0.196 to 0.528.
Rationale quality also significantly increases. Cross-evaluation of SFT + DPO
on various pooling functions show that the gains persist regardless of the
pooling scheme used at train or test time, indicating strong robustness on
summarization of temporal evidence. Similar observations were made on zero-shot
in TVQA.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常使用单一标量量化生成图像质量，无法提供全面且可解释的反馈。需要更全面的评估框架来支持文本到图像模型的偏好对齐。

Method: 引入"观察-思考-预测"范式：先定位潜在缺陷，生成推理，最后给出定量评分。基于视觉语言模型，结合监督微调和强化学习训练。

Result: 在多个数据集上与人类偏好高度一致，作为奖励模型使用时比标量奖励模型提升10%的生成质量。

Conclusion: ImageDoctor作为评估指标有效，且作为奖励模型能显著提升文本到图像模型的生成质量。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of text-to-image (T2I) models has increased the need
for reliable human preference modeling, a demand further amplified by recent
progress in reinforcement learning for preference alignment. However, existing
approaches typically quantify the quality of a generated image using a single
scalar, limiting their ability to provide comprehensive and interpretable
feedback on image quality. To address this, we introduce ImageDoctor, a unified
multi-aspect T2I model evaluation framework that assesses image quality across
four complementary dimensions: plausibility, semantic alignment, aesthetics,
and overall quality. ImageDoctor also provides pixel-level flaw indicators in
the form of heatmaps, which highlight misaligned or implausible regions, and
can be used as a dense reward for T2I model preference alignment. Inspired by
the diagnostic process, we improve the detail sensitivity and reasoning
capability of ImageDoctor by introducing a "look-think-predict" paradigm, where
the model first localizes potential flaws, then generates reasoning, and
finally concludes the evaluation with quantitative scores. Built on top of a
vision-language model and trained through a combination of supervised
fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, ImageDoctor demonstrates strong
alignment with human preference across multiple datasets, establishing its
effectiveness as an evaluation metric. Furthermore, when used as a reward model
for preference tuning, ImageDoctor significantly improves generation quality --
achieving an improvement of 10% over scalar-based reward models.

Motivation: 现有基于深度学习的高光谱分类模型对对抗攻击高度脆弱，存在严重安全风险。虽然已有方法尝试通过修改网络架构来增强鲁棒性，但这些定制化设计限制了可扩展性，且无法有效防御强攻击。

Method: 将对抗训练引入高光谱领域，并提出AT-RA方法。通过数据增强技术增加光谱信息多样性，确保空间平滑性，从而保护和校正高光谱图像中的光谱语义信息。

Result: 实验结果显示，AT-RA方法在对抗AutoAttack时提升了21.34%的鲁棒性，对抗PGD-50时提升了18.78%的鲁棒性，同时将良性准确率提高了2.68%。

Conclusion: 对抗训练是防御对抗攻击的有效方法，但高光谱数据带来了RGB图像中不存在的独特挑战。AT-RA方法通过处理光谱语义信息失真问题，显著提升了高光谱模型的对抗鲁棒性。

Abstract: Recent studies have revealed that hyperspectral classification models based
on deep learning are highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which pose
significant security risks. Although several approaches have attempted to
enhance adversarial robustness by modifying network architectures, these
methods often rely on customized designs that limit scalability and fail to
defend effectively against strong attacks. To address these challenges, we
introduce adversarial training to the hyperspectral domain, which is widely
regarded as one of the most effective defenses against adversarial attacks.
Through extensive empirical analyses, we demonstrate that while adversarial
training does enhance robustness across various models and datasets,
hyperspectral data introduces unique challenges not seen in RGB images.
Specifically, we find that adversarial noise and the non-smooth nature of
adversarial examples can distort or eliminate important spectral semantic
information. To mitigate this issue, we employ data augmentation techniques and
propose a novel hyperspectral adversarial training method, termed AT-RA. By
increasing the diversity of spectral information and ensuring spatial
smoothness, AT-RA preserves and corrects spectral semantics in hyperspectral
images. Experimental results show that AT-RA improves adversarial robustness by
21.34% against AutoAttack and 18.78% against PGD-50 while boosting benign
accuracy by 2.68%.

Method: 将密钥与扩散模型的潜在人脸表示结合，通过面部掩码约束生成以保护身份无关特征，使用确定性前向和后向扩散过程确保原始人脸可恢复。

Result: 该方法生成的人脸匿名化图像与原始人脸视觉相似度更低，相比先前工作表现更优。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了安全、高质量的可逆人脸匿名化，为隐私保护提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Face images processed by computer vision algorithms contain sensitive
personal information that malicious actors can capture without consent. These
privacy and security risks highlight the need for effective face anonymization
methods. Current methods struggle to propose a good trade-off between a secure
scheme with high-quality image generation and reversibility for later person
authentication. Diffusion-based approaches produce high-quality anonymized
images but lack the secret key mechanism to ensure that only authorized parties
can reverse the process. In this paper, we introduce, to our knowledge, the
first secure, high-quality reversible anonymization method based on a diffusion
model. We propose to combine the secret key with the latent faces
representation of the diffusion model. To preserve identity-irrelevant
features, generation is constrained by a facial mask, maintaining high-quality
images. By using a deterministic forward and backward diffusion process, our
approach enforces that the original face can be recovered with the correct
secret key. We also show that the proposed method produces anonymized faces
that are less visually similar to the original faces, compared to other
previous work.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统伪离散扩散方法依赖连续潜在空间扩散或掩码策略，ADD旨在直接在one-hot空间中实现真正的离散扩散，弥合判别式学习和生成式学习之间的差距。

Method: 使用浮点编码的one-hot类别数据作为扩散输入，引入时间步条件交叉熵损失，在扩散模型输出和原始one-hot标签之间建立联系。

Result: 在分类任务上表现优于基线方法，在图像描述生成任务上展现出优秀的文本生成能力，各组件均带来可衡量的性能提升。

Conclusion: ADD框架通过直接在one-hot空间中实现离散扩散，成功连接了判别式和生成式学习，在多个任务上取得了优异性能。

Abstract: We propose an Authentic Discrete Diffusion (ADD) framework that fundamentally
redefines prior pseudo-discrete approaches by preserving core diffusion
characteristics directly in the one-hot space through a suite of coordinated
mechanisms. Unlike conventional "pseudo" discrete diffusion (PDD) methods, ADD
reformulates the diffusion input by directly using float-encoded one-hot class
data, without relying on diffusing in the continuous latent spaces or masking
policies. At its core, a timestep-conditioned cross-entropy loss is introduced
between the diffusion model's outputs and the original one-hot labels. This
synergistic design establishes a bridge between discriminative and generative
learning. Our experiments demonstrate that ADD not only achieves superior
performance on classification tasks compared to the baseline, but also exhibits
excellent text generation capabilities on Image captioning. Extensive ablations
validate the measurable gains of each component.

Abstract: While recent generative models advance pixel-space video synthesis, they
remain limited in producing professional educational videos, which demand
disciplinary knowledge, precise visual structures, and coherent transitions,
limiting their applicability in educational scenarios. Intuitively, such
requirements are better addressed through the manipulation of a renderable
environment, which can be explicitly controlled via logical commands (e.g.,
code). In this work, we propose Code2Video, a code-centric agent framework for
generating educational videos via executable Python code. The framework
comprises three collaborative agents: (i) Planner, which structures lecture
content into temporally coherent flows and prepares corresponding visual

TL;DR: EvoWorld是一个结合全景视频生成与演化3D记忆的世界模型，能够实现空间一致的长时程探索。通过单张全景图像输入，生成未来视频帧并演化3D重建，利用几何重投影提供空间引导，显著提升视觉真实性和几何一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受人类能够在脑海中探索和重放3D环境的能力启发，旨在开发能够实现空间一致长时程探索的世界模型。当前方法仅合成视频，缺乏利用演化3D重建作为显式空间引导的关键洞察。

Method: 1. 使用具有细粒度视图控制的视频生成器生成未来视频帧
2. 通过前馈即插即用transformer演化场景的3D重建
3. 基于演化显式3D记忆的几何重投影合成未来帧
4. 利用重建几何投影到目标视角提供丰富空间线索

Result: 在合成户外环境、Habitat室内场景和真实世界场景的综合基准测试中，演化3D记忆显著提升了视觉保真度并保持了空间场景一致性，相比现有方法有显著改进。

Conclusion: EvoWorld通过演化3D记忆作为显式空间引导，在长时程空间一致世界建模方面取得了重要进展，为世界模型的发展提供了新方向。

Abstract: Humans possess a remarkable ability to mentally explore and replay 3D
environments they have previously experienced. Inspired by this mental process,
we present EvoWorld: a world model that bridges panoramic video generation with
evolving 3D memory to enable spatially consistent long-horizon exploration.
Given a single panoramic image as input, EvoWorld first generates future video
frames by leveraging a video generator with fine-grained view control, then
evolves the scene's 3D reconstruction using a feedforward plug-and-play
transformer, and finally synthesizes futures by conditioning on geometric
reprojections from this evolving explicit 3D memory. Unlike prior
state-of-the-arts that synthesize videos only, our key insight lies in
exploiting this evolving 3D reconstruction as explicit spatial guidance for the
video generation process, projecting the reconstructed geometry onto target
viewpoints to provide rich spatial cues that significantly enhance both visual
realism and geometric consistency. To evaluate long-range exploration
capabilities, we introduce the first comprehensive benchmark spanning synthetic
outdoor environments, Habitat indoor scenes, and challenging real-world
scenarios, with particular emphasis on loop-closure detection and spatial
coherence over extended trajectories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our evolving 3D memory substantially improves visual fidelity and maintains
spatial scene coherence compared to existing approaches, representing a
significant advance toward long-horizon spatially consistent world modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视频编辑中多主体编辑的挑战，包括提示侧多模态条件不足和视频中掩码边界纠缠问题，扩展视频编辑的适用性。

Method: 通过提示引导的多模态对齐模块和基于先验的掩码重定向模块，提供强大的多模态条件和精确的掩码序列，利用大模型的理解和生成能力，然后将获得的先验掩码序列输入预训练的掩码驱动视频生成模型来合成编辑后的视频。

Conclusion: IMAGEdit是一个通用且有效的视频多主体编辑框架，兼容任何掩码驱动视频生成模型，显著提升了整体性能，代码、模型和数据集已公开。

Abstract: In this paper, we present IMAGEdit, a training-free framework for any number
of video subject editing that manipulates the appearances of multiple
designated subjects while preserving non-target regions, without finetuning or
retraining. We achieve this by providing robust multimodal conditioning and
precise mask sequences through a prompt-guided multimodal alignment module and
a prior-based mask retargeting module. We first leverage large models'
understanding and generation capabilities to produce multimodal information and
mask motion sequences for multiple subjects across various types. Then, the
obtained prior mask sequences are fed into a pretrained mask-driven video
generation model to synthesize the edited video. With strong generalization
capability, IMAGEdit remedies insufficient prompt-side multimodal conditioning
and overcomes mask boundary entanglement in videos with any number of subjects,
thereby significantly expanding the applicability of video editing. More
importantly, IMAGEdit is compatible with any mask-driven video generation
model, significantly improving overall performance. Extensive experiments on
our newly constructed multi-subject benchmark MSVBench verify that IMAGEdit
consistently surpasses state-of-the-art methods. Code, models, and datasets are

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有策略梯度方法在文本到图像模型对齐中存在训练不稳定和高方差问题，阻碍收敛速度并影响图像质量

Method: PCPO框架通过稳定目标重构和时间步重新加权，强制实施比例信用分配，纠正生成采样器的数学结构导致的反馈不稳定问题

Result: PCPO显著稳定了训练过程，加速收敛并提升图像质量，在所有方面都优于现有策略梯度基线方法包括最先进的DanceGRPO

Conclusion: 比例信用分配是解决文本到图像模型强化学习训练不稳定的关键，PCPO框架有效缓解了模型崩溃问题并实现了更优的性能

Abstract: While reinforcement learning has advanced the alignment of text-to-image
(T2I) models, state-of-the-art policy gradient methods are still hampered by
training instability and high variance, hindering convergence speed and
compromising image quality. Our analysis identifies a key cause of this
instability: disproportionate credit assignment, in which the mathematical
structure of the generative sampler produces volatile and non-proportional
feedback across timesteps. To address this, we introduce Proportionate Credit
Policy Optimization (PCPO), a framework that enforces proportional credit
assignment through a stable objective reformulation and a principled
reweighting of timesteps. This correction stabilizes the training process,
leading to significantly accelerated convergence and superior image quality.
The improvement in quality is a direct result of mitigating model collapse, a
common failure mode in recursive training. PCPO substantially outperforms
existing policy gradient baselines on all fronts, including the
state-of-the-art DanceGRPO.

TL;DR: RoboPilot是一个双思维闭环机器人操作框架，通过快速和慢速思维切换平衡效率与准确性，在动态环境中实现自适应推理和复杂任务执行。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自主机器人系统主要采用开环范式，缺乏推理和反馈机制，导致环境变化适应性差和错误累积严重。

Method: 结合原始动作进行结构化任务规划和灵活动作生成，引入反馈机制支持动态变化和错误恢复，采用思维链推理增强高层任务规划和低层动作生成。

Result: 在RoboPilot-Bench基准测试中，任务成功率比最先进基线方法提高25.9%，工业机器人实际部署验证了其在真实环境中的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: RoboPilot框架通过闭环反馈和双思维机制，显著提升了机器人在复杂任务执行中的鲁棒性和适应性。

Abstract: Despite rapid progress in autonomous robotics, executing complex or
long-horizon tasks remains a fundamental challenge. Most current approaches
follow an open-loop paradigm with limited reasoning and no feedback, resulting
in poor robustness to environmental changes and severe error accumulation. We
present RoboPilot, a dual-thinking closed-loop framework for robotic
manipulation that supports adaptive reasoning for complex tasks in real-world
dynamic environments. RoboPilot leverages primitive actions for structured task
planning and flexible action generation, while introducing feedback to enable
replanning from dynamic changes and execution errors. Chain-of-Thought
reasoning further enhances high-level task planning and guides low-level action
generation. The system dynamically switches between fast and slow thinking to
balance efficiency and accuracy. To systematically evaluate the robustness of
RoboPilot in diverse robot manipulation scenarios, we introduce
RoboPilot-Bench, a benchmark spanning 21 tasks across 10 categories, including
infeasible-task recognition and failure recovery. Experiments show that
RoboPilot outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 25.9\% in task success
rate, and the real-world deployment on an industrial robot further demonstrates
its robustness in real-world settings.

TL;DR: 研究评估了Gemini 2.5 Flash在任务与运动规划(TAMP)中的表现，发现LLM规划器在成功率和规划时间上不如传统工程方法，几何细节会增加任务规划错误，非推理LLM变体在多数情况下优于推理变体。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLM在复杂机器人问题中的规划能力，特别是如何将LLM的语义知识与TAMP的形式推理相结合，以了解这种集成在机器人任务空间中的覆盖范围。

Method: 开发了16种使用Gemini 2.5 Flash替代关键TAMP组件的算法，在4,950个问题和三个领域进行零样本实验，比较不同集成方式的效果。

Result: Gemini规划器相比工程化对应方法成功率更低、规划时间更长；提供几何细节会增加任务规划错误；非推理LLM变体在多数情况下优于推理变体，因为TAMP系统可以指导LLM纠正错误。

Conclusion: 当前LLM在TAMP中的集成仍面临挑战，需要更有效的方法来结合LLM的语义能力和TAMP的形式推理，非推理方法在某些场景下可能更实用。

Abstract: Using large language models (LLMs) to solve complex robotics problems
requires understanding their planning capabilities. Yet while we know that LLMs
can plan on some problems, the extent to which these planning capabilities
cover the space of robotics tasks is unclear. One promising direction is to
integrate the semantic knowledge of LLMs with the formal reasoning of task and
motion planning (TAMP). However, the myriad of choices for how to integrate
LLMs within TAMP complicates the design of such systems. We develop 16
algorithms that use Gemini 2.5 Flash to substitute key TAMP components. Our
zero-shot experiments across 4,950 problems and three domains reveal that the
Gemini-based planners exhibit lower success rates and higher planning times
than their engineered counterparts. We show that providing geometric details
increases the number of task-planning errors compared to pure PDDL
descriptions, and that (faster) non-reasoning LLM variants outperform (slower)
reasoning variants in most cases, since the TAMP system can direct the LLM to
correct its mistakes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统NMPC计算负担重，而纯DNN近似在遇到训练数据未覆盖的干扰或工况时缺乏鲁棒性，导致跟踪误差大。

Method: 开发了混合NMPC-DNN-PI控制器，结合DNN的NMPC近似输出与PI控制器，应用于三关节（踝、膝、髋）外骨骼机器人的下蹲运动控制。

Result: 在DNN未见条件下，混合控制器的跟踪误差显著低于纯NMPC-DNN；外骨骼使用使人体关节扭矩大幅降低（踝30.9%、膝41.8%、髋29.7%）；计算成本比NMPC降低99.93%。

Conclusion: 混合NMPC-DNN-PI控制器在保持NMPC精度的同时，显著提高了鲁棒性并大幅降低了计算负担，为复杂动态系统的实时控制提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) is a precise controller, but its
heavy computational load often prevents application in robotic systems. Some
studies have attempted to approximate NMPC using deep neural networks
(NMPC-DNN). However, in the presence of unexpected disturbances or when
operating conditions differ from training data, this approach lacks robustness,
leading to large tracking errors. To address this issue, for the first time,
the NMPC-DNN output is combined with a PI controller (Hybrid NMPC-DNN-PI). The
proposed controller is validated by applying it to an exoskeleton robot during
squat movement, which has a complex dynamic model and has received limited
attention regarding robust nonlinear control design. A human-robot dynamic
model with three active joints (ankle, knee, hip) is developed, and more than
5.3 million training samples are used to train the DNN. The results show that,
under unseen conditions for the DNN, the tracking error in Hybrid NMPC-DNN-PI
is significantly lower compared to NMPC-DNN. Moreover, human joint torques are
greatly reduced with the use of the exoskeleton, with RMS values for the
studied case reduced by 30.9%, 41.8%, and 29.7% at the ankle, knee, and hip,
respectively. In addition, the computational cost of Hybrid NMPC-DNN-PI is
99.93% lower than that of NMPC.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: TGPO是一种解决通用信号时序逻辑任务的分层强化学习方法，通过将STL分解为时序子目标和不变约束，使用高层时间分配和低层策略学习，显著提升了复杂任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 信号时序逻辑(STL)为机器人任务提供了强大的表达能力，但其非马尔可夫性和稀疏奖励特性使得标准强化学习方法难以有效解决。现有方法要么只能处理有限的STL片段，要么只能将STL鲁棒性分数作为稀疏终端奖励。

Method: TGPO采用分层框架：高层组件为子目标分配具体时间，低层时间条件策略使用密集的阶段奖励学习实现序列子目标。在推理时采样多种时间分配，并利用学习到的critic通过Metropolis-Hastings采样指导高层时间搜索。

Result: 在五个环境（导航、操作、无人机、四足机器人运动）的广泛STL任务测试中，TGPO显著优于现有最优方法，平均任务成功率比最佳基线提高31.6%，特别是在高维和长时域情况下表现更优。

Conclusion: TGPO通过将STL任务分解为时序子目标并提供密集的阶段奖励，有效解决了STL的非马尔可夫性和稀疏奖励问题，为复杂长时域任务的学习提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Learning control policies for complex, long-horizon tasks is a central
challenge in robotics and autonomous systems. Signal Temporal Logic (STL)
offers a powerful and expressive language for specifying such tasks, but its
non-Markovian nature and inherent sparse reward make it difficult to be solved
via standard Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms. Prior RL approaches focus
only on limited STL fragments or use STL robustness scores as sparse terminal
rewards. In this paper, we propose TGPO, Temporal Grounded Policy Optimization,
to solve general STL tasks. TGPO decomposes STL into timed subgoals and
invariant constraints and provides a hierarchical framework to tackle the
problem. The high-level component of TGPO proposes concrete time allocations
for these subgoals, and the low-level time-conditioned policy learns to achieve
the sequenced subgoals using a dense, stage-wise reward signal. During
inference, we sample various time allocations and select the most promising
assignment for the policy network to rollout the solution trajectory. To foster
efficient policy learning for complex STL with multiple subgoals, we leverage
the learned critic to guide the high-level temporal search via
Metropolis-Hastings sampling, focusing exploration on temporally feasible
solutions. We conduct experiments on five environments, ranging from
low-dimensional navigation to manipulation, drone, and quadrupedal locomotion.
Under a wide range of STL tasks, TGPO significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines (especially for high-dimensional and long-horizon
cases), with an average of 31.6% improvement in task success rate compared to
the best baseline. The code will be available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MPPI控制虽然快速且无需梯度，但缺乏硬性约束保证。需要一种方法在保持MPPI优点的同时提供安全保证。

Method: 为每个状态和输入约束附加概率代理，在每次重规划时评估候选轨迹的可行性概率，该联合概率缩放候选轨迹权重，推动采样分布朝向安全子集。

Result: 在四旋翼无人机上测试，BC-MPPI在保持安全裕度的同时满足规定的违反概率要求，适用于静态和动态障碍物场景。

Conclusion: BC-MPPI提供了一种自然集成到可认证自主系统验证-确认流程的方法，代理作为独立版本控制构件，运行时安全评分为单个标量。

Abstract: Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) control has recently emerged as a fast,
gradient-free alternative to model-predictive control in highly non-linear
robotic tasks, yet it offers no hard guarantees on constraint satisfaction. We
introduce Bayesian-Constraints MPPI (BC-MPPI), a lightweight safety layer that
attaches a probabilistic surrogate to every state and input constraint. At each
re-planning step the surrogate returns the probability that a candidate
trajectory is feasible; this joint probability scales the weight given to a
candidate, automatically down-weighting rollouts likely to collide or exceed
limits and pushing the sampling distribution toward the safe subset; no
hand-tuned penalty costs or explicit sample rejection required. We train the
surrogate from 1000 offline simulations and deploy the controller on a
quadrotor in MuJoCo with both static and moving obstacles. Across K in
[100,1500] rollouts BC-MPPI preserves safety margins while satisfying the
prescribed probability of violation. Because the surrogate is a stand-alone,
version-controlled artefact and the runtime safety score is a single scalar,
the approach integrates naturally with verification-and-validation pipelines
for certifiable autonomous systems.

Motivation: 研究人类运动控制中的动态成本结构，传统IRL方法需要大量演示数据且收敛慢，需要更高效的方法来建模时变运动策略。

Method: 使用最小观测逆强化学习(MO-IRL)，将轨迹分段并学习阶段特定的成本函数组合，在最大熵IRL框架中缩放观测和生成轨迹。

Result: 训练10个试验后，六段和八段权重划分的平均关节角度RMSE分别为6.4度和5.6度，优于静态权重的10.4度。交叉验证和跨被试验证显示约8度RMSE的预测精度。

Conclusion: MO-IRL能高效揭示人类运动控制的动态、被试独立成本结构，学习到的权重在运动起始和终止阶段强调关节加速度最小化，符合生物运动的平滑性原则，具有人形机器人应用的潜力。

Abstract: This paper investigates the application of Minimal Observation Inverse
Reinforcement Learning (MO-IRL) to model and predict human arm-reaching
movements with time-varying cost weights. Using a planar two-link biomechanical
model and high-resolution motion-capture data from subjects performing a
pointing task, we segment each trajectory into multiple phases and learn
phase-specific combinations of seven candidate cost functions. MO-IRL
iteratively refines cost weights by scaling observed and generated trajectories
in the maximum entropy IRL formulation, greatly reducing the number of required
demonstrations and convergence time compared to classical IRL approaches.
Training on ten trials per posture yields average joint-angle Root Mean Squared
Errors (RMSE) of 6.4 deg and 5.6 deg for six- and eight-segment weight
divisions, respectively, versus 10.4 deg using a single static weight.
Cross-validation on remaining trials and, for the first time, inter-subject
validation on an unseen subject's 20 trials, demonstrates comparable predictive
accuracy, around 8 deg RMSE, indicating robust generalization. Learned weights
emphasize joint acceleration minimization during movement onset and
termination, aligning with smoothness principles observed in biological motion.
These results suggest that MO-IRL can efficiently uncover dynamic,
subject-independent cost structures underlying human motor control, with
potential applications for humanoid robots.

Conclusion: DiSA-IQL有效解决了离线强化学习中的分布偏移问题，为软体机器人控制提供了更可靠的解决方案，代码已开源以支持可复现性

Abstract: Soft snake robots offer remarkable flexibility and adaptability in complex
environments, yet their control remains challenging due to highly nonlinear
dynamics. Existing model-based and bio-inspired controllers rely on simplified
assumptions that limit performance. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has
recently emerged as a promising alternative, but online training is often
impractical because of costly and potentially damaging real-world interactions.
Offline RL provides a safer option by leveraging pre-collected datasets, but it
suffers from distribution shift, which degrades generalization to unseen
scenarios. To overcome this challenge, we propose DiSA-IQL
(Distribution-Shift-Aware Implicit Q-Learning), an extension of IQL that
incorporates robustness modulation by penalizing unreliable state-action pairs
to mitigate distribution shift. We evaluate DiSA-IQL on goal-reaching tasks
across two settings: in-distribution and out-of-distribution evaluation.
Simulation results show that DiSA-IQL consistently outperforms baseline models,
including Behavior Cloning (BC), Conservative Q-Learning (CQL), and vanilla
IQL, achieving higher success rates, smoother trajectories, and improved
robustness. The codes are open-sourced to support reproducibility and to
facilitate further research in offline RL for soft robot control.

Abstract: Long-horizon motion forecasting for multiple autonomous robots is challenging
due to non-linear agent interactions, compounding prediction errors, and
continuous-time evolution of dynamics. Learned dynamics of such a system can be
useful in various applications such as travel time prediction,
prediction-guided planning and generative simulation. In this work, we aim to
develop an efficient trajectory forecasting model conditioned on multi-agent
goals. Motivated by the recent success of physics-guided deep learning for
partially known dynamical systems, we develop a model based on neural
Controlled Differential Equations (CDEs) for long-horizon motion forecasting.
Unlike discrete-time methods such as RNNs and transformers, neural CDEs operate
in continuous time, allowing us to combine physics-informed constraints and
biases to jointly model multi-robot dynamics. Our approach, named PINCoDE
(Physics-Informed Neural Controlled Differential Equations), learns
differential equation parameters that can be used to predict the trajectories
of a multi-agent system starting from an initial condition. PINCoDE is
conditioned on future goals and enforces physics constraints for robot motion
over extended periods of time. We adopt a strategy that scales our model from
10 robots to 100 robots without the need for additional model parameters, while
producing predictions with an average ADE below 0.5 m for a 1-minute horizon.
Furthermore, progressive training with curriculum learning for our PINCoDE
model results in a 2.7X reduction of forecasted pose error over 4 minute
horizons compared to analytical models.

Motivation: 现有VLA模型主要依赖模仿学习，存在复合误差和分布偏移下鲁棒性差的问题。强化学习可以缓解这些问题，但通常需要昂贵的真实世界交互或面临仿真到现实的差距。

Method: 使用从真实交互数据训练的世界模型作为可控模拟器，预测基于动作的未来视觉观察，通过目标达成的参考轨迹提供密集的轨迹级奖励信号，实现高效且动作对齐的学习。

Conclusion: 基于世界模型的强化微调是一种实用的后训练范式，可有效增强VLA模型的泛化能力和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models enable embodied decision-making but rely
heavily on imitation learning, leading to compounding errors and poor
robustness under distribution shift. Reinforcement learning (RL) can mitigate
these issues yet typically demands costly real-world interactions or suffers
from sim-to-real gaps. We introduce VLA-RFT, a reinforcement fine-tuning
framework that leverages a data-driven world model as a controllable simulator.
Trained from real interaction data, the simulator predicts future visual
observations conditioned on actions, allowing policy rollouts with dense,
trajectory-level rewards derived from goal-achieving references. This design
delivers an efficient and action-aligned learning signal, drastically lowering
sample requirements. With fewer than 400 fine-tuning steps, VLA-RFT surpasses
strong supervised baselines and achieves greater efficiency than
simulator-based RL. Moreover, it exhibits strong robustness under perturbed
conditions, sustaining stable task execution. Our results establish
world-model-based RFT as a practical post-training paradigm to enhance the
generalization and robustness of VLA models. For more details, please refer to

Abstract: Visual navigation is a fundamental problem in embodied AI, yet practical
deployments demand long-horizon planning capabilities to address
multi-objective tasks. A major bottleneck is data scarcity: policies learned
from limited data often overfit and fail to generalize OOD. Existing neural
network-based agents typically increase architectural complexity that
paradoxically become counterproductive in the small-sample regime. This paper
introduce NeuRO, a integrated learning-to-optimize framework that tightly
couples perception networks with downstream task-level robust optimization.
Specifically, NeuRO addresses core difficulties in this integration: (i) it
transforms noisy visual predictions under data scarcity into convex uncertainty
sets using Partially Input Convex Neural Networks (PICNNs) with conformal
calibration, which directly parameterize the optimization constraints; and (ii)
it reformulates planning under partial observability as a robust optimization
problem, enabling uncertainty-aware policies that transfer across environments.
Extensive experiments on both unordered and sequential multi-object navigation
tasks demonstrate that NeuRO establishes SoTA performance, particularly in
generalization to unseen environments. Our work thus presents a significant
advancement for developing robust, generalizable autonomous agents.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising framework for
addressing robot social navigation challenges. However, inherent uncertainties
in pedestrian behavior and limited environmental interaction during training
often lead to suboptimal exploration and distributional shifts between offline
training and online deployment. To overcome these limitations, this paper
proposes a novel offline-to-online fine-tuning RL algorithm for robot social
navigation by integrating Return-to-Go (RTG) prediction into a causal
Transformer architecture. Our algorithm features a spatiotem-poral fusion model
designed to precisely estimate RTG values in real-time by jointly encoding
temporal pedestrian motion patterns and spatial crowd dynamics. This RTG
prediction framework mitigates distribution shift by aligning offline policy
training with online environmental interactions. Furthermore, a hybrid
offline-online experience sampling mechanism is built to stabilize policy
updates during fine-tuning, ensuring balanced integration of pre-trained
knowledge and real-time adaptation. Extensive experiments in simulated social
navigation environments demonstrate that our method achieves a higher success
rate and lower collision rate compared to state-of-the-art baselines. These
results underscore the efficacy of our algorithm in enhancing navigation policy
robustness and adaptability. This work paves the way for more reliable and
adaptive robotic navigation systems in real-world applications.

TL;DR: Traj2Action是一个通过3D轨迹作为中间表示来弥合人类与机器人形态差距的框架，将人类视频中的操作知识转移到机器人动作中，在真实机器人实验中性能提升显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决机器人多样化操作技能学习依赖于昂贵且难以扩展的遥操作演示的问题，利用人类视频作为可扩展的替代方案，但面临人类与机器人形态差距的挑战。

Method: 使用操作端点的3D轨迹作为统一中间表示，先学习生成粗略轨迹作为高级运动规划，然后在协同去噪框架中合成精确的机器人特定动作（如方向和抓取器状态）。

Result: 在Franka机器人上的真实世界实验显示，Traj2Action在短期和长期任务上分别比基线性能提升27%和22.25%，且随着人类数据规模增加，机器人策略学习效果显著提升。

Conclusion: Traj2Action通过轨迹作为中间表示有效弥合了人类与机器人之间的形态差距，实现了从人类视频到机器人操作技能的高效转移。

Abstract: Learning diverse manipulation skills for real-world robots is severely
bottlenecked by the reliance on costly and hard-to-scale teleoperated
demonstrations. While human videos offer a scalable alternative, effectively
transferring manipulation knowledge is fundamentally hindered by the
significant morphological gap between human and robotic embodiments. To address
this challenge and facilitate skill transfer from human to robot, we introduce
Traj2Action,a novel framework that bridges this embodiment gap by using the 3D
trajectory of the operational endpoint as a unified intermediate
representation, and then transfers the manipulation knowledge embedded in this
trajectory to the robot's actions. Our policy first learns to generate a coarse
trajectory, which forms an high-level motion plan by leveraging both human and
robot data. This plan then conditions the synthesis of precise, robot-specific
actions (e.g., orientation and gripper state) within a co-denoising framework.
Extensive real-world experiments on a Franka robot demonstrate that Traj2Action
boosts the performance by up to 27% and 22.25% over $\pi_0$ baseline on short-
and long-horizon real-world tasks, and achieves significant gains as human data
scales in robot policy learning. Our project website, featuring code and video
demonstrations, is available at

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出一种两阶段异常值检测方法，用于紧耦合GNSS-RTK/INS/里程计组合导航系统，通过多普勒测量和预积分IMU/里程计约束来检测和剔除伪距异常值，提高复杂环境下的定位精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 复杂环境中GNSS定位面临非视距传播、多径效应和信号遮挡等挑战，这些因素会在原始伪距测量中引入大异常值，严重影响GNSS-RTK定位性能和紧耦合组合导航系统的有效性。

Method: 采用两阶段异常值检测：第一阶段使用多普勒测量进行GNSS-only异常检测（多普勒对多径和NLOS效应不敏感）；第二阶段使用预积分IMU和里程计约束生成预测的双差伪距测量，进行更精细的异常识别和剔除。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法显著降低了伪距异常值的影响，提高了定位精度和一致性。在深度城市峡谷测试中，将GNSS-RTK/INS/里程计融合的RMSE从0.52米降低到0.30米，提升了42.3%。

Conclusion: 两阶段检测框架通过结合互补的检测方法，有效提升了系统对粗大伪距误差和卫星测量质量下降的鲁棒性，在复杂环境中实现了更可靠的定位性能。

Abstract: Reliable GNSS positioning in complex environments remains a critical
challenge due to non-line-of-sight (NLOS) propagation, multipath effects, and
frequent signal blockages. These effects can easily introduce large outliers
into the raw pseudo-range measurements, which significantly degrade the
performance of global navigation satellite system (GNSS) real-time kinematic
(RTK) positioning and limit the effectiveness of tightly coupled GNSS-based
integrated navigation system. To address this issue, we propose a two-stage
outlier detection method and apply the method in a tightly coupled GNSS-RTK,
inertial navigation system (INS), and odometer integration based on factor
graph optimization (FGO). In the first stage, Doppler measurements are employed
to detect pseudo-range outliers in a GNSS-only manner, since Doppler is less
sensitive to multipath and NLOS effects compared with pseudo-range, making it a
more stable reference for detecting sudden inconsistencies. In the second
stage, pre-integrated inertial measurement units (IMU) and odometer constraints
are used to generate predicted double-difference pseudo-range measurements,
which enable a more refined identification and rejection of remaining outliers.
By combining these two complementary stages, the system achieves improved
robustness against both gross pseudo-range errors and degraded satellite
measuring quality. The experimental results demonstrate that the two-stage
detection framework significantly reduces the impact of pseudo-range outliers,
and leads to improved positioning accuracy and consistency compared with
representative baseline approaches. In the deep urban canyon test, the outlier
mitigation method has limits the RMSE of GNSS-RTK/INS/odometer fusion from 0.52
m to 0.30 m, with 42.3% improvement.

Method: 设计溢出预测器估计当前观察和动作序列下的溢出概率，在推理时作为可微分引导信号指导扩散采样过程。

Result: 在6种食物类别上训练，在10种未见类别上评估，任务成功率达82%，溢出率仅4%，比无引导基线减少40%以上溢出。

Conclusion: GRITS框架能有效减少食物舀取过程中的溢出，提高任务可靠性，在真实机器人平台上表现优异。

Abstract: Robotic food scooping is a critical manipulation skill for food preparation
and service robots. However, existing robot learning algorithms, especially
learn-from-demonstration methods, still struggle to handle diverse and dynamic
food states, which often results in spillage and reduced reliability. In this
work, we introduce GRITS: A Spillage-Aware Guided Diffusion Policy for Robot
Food Scooping Tasks. This framework leverages guided diffusion policy to
minimize food spillage during scooping and to ensure reliable transfer of food
items from the initial to the target location. Specifically, we design a
spillage predictor that estimates the probability of spillage given current
observation and action rollout. The predictor is trained on a simulated dataset
with food spillage scenarios, constructed from four primitive shapes (spheres,
cubes, cones, and cylinders) with varied physical properties such as mass,
friction, and particle size. At inference time, the predictor serves as a
differentiable guidance signal, steering the diffusion sampling process toward
safer trajectories while preserving task success. We validate GRITS on a
real-world robotic food scooping platform. GRITS is trained on six food
categories and evaluated on ten unseen categories with different shapes and
quantities. GRITS achieves an 82% task success rate and a 4% spillage rate,
reducing spillage by over 40% compared to baselines without guidance, thereby
demonstrating its effectiveness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 思维链(CoT)策略虽然能提升性能，但会增加推理时间，这在需要快速响应的机器人操作任务中影响实用性。研究探索是否必须生成长思维链才能获得性能改进。

Method: HyT框架通过混合训练使模型能够学习思维链并从中受益，同时支持在推理时有条件地预测多样化输出——可以直接预测动作、生成思维或遵循指令。

Result: 在模拟基准测试和真实世界实验中验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: HyT框架实现了性能提升与推理效率的平衡，为机器人操作任务提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Using Large Language Models to produce intermediate thoughts, a.k.a.
Chain-of-thought (CoT), before providing an answer has been a successful recipe
for solving complex language tasks. In robotics, similar embodied CoT
strategies, generating thoughts before actions, have also been shown to lead to
improved performance when using Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs). As these
techniques increase the length of the model's generated outputs to include the
thoughts, the inference time is negatively affected. Delaying an agent's
actions in real-world executions, as in robotic manipulation settings, strongly
affects the usability of a method, as tasks require long sequences of actions.
However, is the generation of long chains-of-thought a strong prerequisite for
achieving performance improvements? In this work, we explore the idea of Hybrid
Training (HyT), a framework that enables VLAs to learn from thoughts and
benefit from the associated performance gains, while enabling the possibility
to leave out CoT generation during inference. Furthermore, by learning to
conditionally predict a diverse set of outputs, HyT supports flexibility at
inference time, enabling the model to either predict actions directly, generate
thoughts or follow instructions. We evaluate the proposed method in a series of
simulated benchmarks and real-world experiments.

Conclusion: 该方法对于部署在自动驾驶中的可信AI至关重要，能够监控机器学习模型的能力，确保其在未充分训练场景中的可靠运行。

Abstract: Automated driving functions increasingly rely on machine learning for tasks
like perception and trajectory planning, requiring large, relevant datasets.
The performance of these algorithms depends on how closely the training data
matches the task. To ensure reliable functioning, it is crucial to know what is
included in the dataset to assess the trained model's operational risk. We aim
to enhance the safe use of machine learning in automated driving by developing
a method to recognize situations that an automated vehicle has not been
sufficiently trained on. This method also improves explainability by describing
the dataset at a human-understandable level. We propose modeling driving data
as knowledge graphs, representing driving scenes with entities and their
relationships. These graphs are queried for specific sub-scene configurations
to check their occurrence in the dataset. We estimate a vehicle's competence in
a driving scene by considering the coverage and complexity of sub-scene
configurations in the training set. Higher complexity scenes require greater
coverage for high competence. We apply this method to the NuPlan dataset,
modeling it with knowledge graphs and analyzing the coverage of specific
driving scenes. This approach helps monitor the competence of machine learning
models trained on the dataset, which is essential for trustworthy AI to be
deployed in automated driving.

Conclusion: TBOD提供了一种轻量级、通用的传感器融合方法，能够高效处理通用传感器并以模块化方式工作，最重要的是其简单的调参过程。

Abstract: Efficient observer design and accurate sensor fusion are key in state
estimation. This work proposes an optimization-based methodology, termed
Trajectory Based Optimization Design (TBOD), allowing the user to easily design
observers for general nonlinear systems and multi-sensor setups. Starting from
parametrized observer dynamics, the proposed method considers a finite set of
pre-recorded measurement trajectories from the nominal plant and exploits them
to tune the observer parameters through numerical optimization. This research
hinges on the classic observer's theory and Moving Horizon Estimators
methodology. Optimization is exploited to ease the observer's design, providing
the user with a lightweight, general-purpose sensor fusion methodology. TBOD's
main characteristics are the capability to handle general sensors efficiently
and in a modular way and, most importantly, its straightforward tuning
procedure. The TBOD's performance is tested on a terrestrial rover localization
problem, combining IMU and ranging sensors provided by Ultra Wide Band
antennas, and validated through a motion-capture system. Comparison with an
Extended Kalman Filter is also provided, matching its position estimation
accuracy and significantly improving in the orientation.

Abstract: After years of growth, drone-based delivery is transforming logistics. At its
core, real-time 6-DoF drone pose tracking enables precise flight control and
accurate drone landing. With the widespread availability of urban 3D maps, the
Visual Positioning Service (VPS), a mobile pose estimation system, has been
adapted to enhance drone pose tracking during the landing phase, as
conventional systems like GPS are unreliable in urban environments due to
signal attenuation and multi-path propagation. However, deploying the current
VPS on drones faces limitations in both estimation accuracy and efficiency. In
this work, we redesign drone-oriented VPS with the event camera and introduce
EV-Pose to enable accurate, high-frequency 6-DoF pose tracking for accurate
drone landing. EV-Pose introduces a spatio-temporal feature-instructed pose
estimation module that extracts a temporal distance field to enable 3D point
map matching for pose estimation; and a motion-aware hierarchical fusion and
optimization scheme to enhance the above estimation in accuracy and efficiency,
by utilizing drone motion in the \textit{early stage} of event filtering and
the \textit{later stage} of pose optimization. Evaluation shows that EV-Pose
achieves a rotation accuracy of 1.34$\degree$ and a translation accuracy of
6.9$mm$ with a tracking latency of 10.08$ms$, outperforming baselines by
$>$50\%, \tmcrevise{thus enabling accurate drone landings.} Demo:

TL;DR: HAMLET是一个可扩展框架，通过引入时刻令牌和轻量级记忆模块，使视觉-语言-动作模型能够利用历史上下文进行动作预测，显著提升需要历史依赖的长期任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉-语言-动作模型仅依赖当前观察而忽略历史上下文，但机器人操作任务本质上是历史依赖的，利用过去上下文可能带来益处。

Method: 提出时刻令牌紧凑编码每个时间步的感知信息，通过时间对比学习初始化表示；使用轻量级记忆模块整合过去时刻令牌为记忆特征，用于动作预测。

Result: 在GR00T N1.5上，HAMLET在历史依赖的真实世界任务中达到76.4%平均成功率，比基线提升47.2%；在RoboCasa Kitchen上从64.1%提升至66.4%，在LIBERO上从95.6%提升至97.7%。

Conclusion: HAMLET成功将最先进的VLA转变为历史感知策略，在需要历史上下文的长期任务上表现出显著改进，即使在通用机器人操作基准上也展现出有效性。

Abstract: Inherently, robotic manipulation tasks are history-dependent: leveraging past
context could be beneficial. However, most existing Vision-Language-Action
models (VLAs) have been designed without considering this aspect, i.e., they
rely solely on the current observation, ignoring preceding context. In this
paper, we propose HAMLET, a scalable framework to adapt VLAs to attend to the
historical context during action prediction. Specifically, we introduce moment
tokens that compactly encode perceptual information at each timestep. Their
representations are initialized with time-contrastive learning, allowing them
to better capture temporally distinctive aspects. Next, we employ a lightweight
memory module that integrates the moment tokens across past timesteps into
memory features, which are then leveraged for action prediction. Through
empirical evaluation, we show that HAMLET successfully transforms a
state-of-the-art VLA into a history-aware policy, especially demonstrating
significant improvements on long-horizon tasks that require historical context.
In particular, on top of GR00T N1.5, HAMLET achieves an average success rate of
76.4% on history-dependent real-world tasks, surpassing the baseline
performance by 47.2%. Furthermore, HAMLET pushes prior art performance from
64.1% to 66.4% on RoboCasa Kitchen (100-demo setup) and from 95.6% to 97.7% on
LIBERO, highlighting its effectiveness even under generic robot-manipulation
benchmarks.

Motivation: 通过监督学习从演示中学习机器人操作策略时，当策略遇到训练中未明确覆盖的执行变化时仍然具有挑战性。标准方法处理序列中所有过去状态时没有显式建模演示中可能包含的时间结构（如失败和恢复模式）。

Method: 使用状态转移注意力机制调节标准注意力权重，结合训练期间的时间掩码（随机移除最近时间步的视觉信息）来鼓励从历史上下文进行时间推理。

Result: 在仿真评估中，STA在所有任务中始终优于标准交叉注意力和时间建模方法（如TCN和LSTM网络），在精度关键任务上比交叉注意力提高2倍以上。

Conclusion: 提出的状态转移注意力机制能够有效提升机器人操作策略对执行变化的适应能力，通过显式建模状态演化模式来改善基于历史上下文的行为调整。

Abstract: Learning robotic manipulation policies through supervised learning from
demonstrations remains challenging when policies encounter execution variations
not explicitly covered during training. While incorporating historical context
through attention mechanisms can improve robustness, standard approaches
process all past states in a sequence without explicitly modeling the temporal
structure that demonstrations may include, such as failure and recovery
patterns. We propose a Cross-State Transition Attention Transformer that
employs a novel State Transition Attention (STA) mechanism to modulate standard
attention weights based on learned state evolution patterns, enabling policies
to better adapt their behavior based on execution history. Our approach
combines this structured attention with temporal masking during training, where
visual information is randomly removed from recent timesteps to encourage
temporal reasoning from historical context. Evaluation in simulation shows that
STA consistently outperforms standard cross-attention and temporal modeling
approaches like TCN and LSTM networks across all tasks, achieving more than 2x
improvement over cross-attention on precision-critical tasks.

Abstract: Semantic Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is a critical area of
research within robotics and computer vision, focusing on the simultaneous
localization of robotic systems and associating semantic information to
construct the most accurate and complete comprehensive model of the surrounding
environment. Since the first foundational work in Semantic SLAM appeared more
than two decades ago, this field has received increasing attention across
various scientific communities. Despite its significance, the field lacks
comprehensive surveys encompassing recent advances and persistent challenges.
In response, this study provides a thorough examination of the state-of-the-art
of Semantic SLAM techniques, with the aim of illuminating current trends and
key obstacles. Beginning with an in-depth exploration of the evolution of
visual SLAM, this study outlines its strengths and unique characteristics,
while also critically assessing previous survey literature. Subsequently, a
unified problem formulation and evaluation of the modular solution framework is
proposed, which divides the problem into discrete stages, including visual
localization, semantic feature extraction, mapping, data association, and loop
closure optimization. Moreover, this study investigates alternative
methodologies such as deep learning and the utilization of large language
models, alongside a review of relevant research about contemporary SLAM
datasets. Concluding with a discussion on potential future research directions,
this study serves as a comprehensive resource for researchers seeking to
navigate the complex landscape of Semantic SLAM.

TL;DR: 提出首个随机到目标织物平整策略，通过混合模仿学习-视觉伺服框架实现从随机褶皱状态到任意无褶皱目标状态的精准对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决织物生产中的机器人操作挑战，包括织物可变形性、无限自由度以及褶皱、折叠和机械臂遮挡等问题。

Method: 采用混合IL-VS框架：IL使用显式织物模型进行粗对齐，VS进行精细对齐；核心是基于模板的网格表示，并提出MACT Transformer策略。

Result: 在真实双臂遥操作系统上验证，展示了对不同目标的零样本对齐、高精度以及跨织物和尺度的强泛化能力。

Conclusion: RTFF策略成功解决了织物平整对齐的关键挑战，为机器人织物操作提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Robotic fabric manipulation in garment production for sewing, cutting, and
ironing requires reliable flattening and alignment, yet remains challenging due
to fabric deformability, effectively infinite degrees of freedom, and frequent
occlusions from wrinkles, folds, and the manipulator's End-Effector (EE) and
arm. To address these issues, this paper proposes the first Random-to-Target
Fabric Flattening (RTFF) policy, which aligns a random wrinkled fabric state to
an arbitrary wrinkle-free target state. The proposed policy adopts a hybrid
Imitation Learning-Visual Servoing (IL-VS) framework, where IL learns with
explicit fabric models for coarse alignment of the wrinkled fabric toward a
wrinkle-free state near the target, and VS ensures fine alignment to the
target. Central to this framework is a template-based mesh that offers precise
target state representation, wrinkle-aware geometry prediction, and consistent
vertex correspondence across RTFF manipulation steps, enabling robust
manipulation and seamless IL-VS switching. Leveraging the power of mesh, a
novel IL solution for RTFF-Mesh Action Chunking Transformer (MACT)-is then
proposed by conditioning the mesh information into a Transformer-based policy.
The RTFF policy is validated on a real dual-arm tele-operation system, showing
zero-shot alignment to different targets, high accuracy, and strong
generalization across fabrics and scales. Project website:

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于产品-过程-资源（PPR）建模范式的PoPAN模型，旨在将产品生命周期末端阶段的影响整合到工程阶段，支持在信息物理生产系统中进行维修、再制造或升级改造。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前工业标准主要关注生产阶段而非完整产品生命周期，且侧重于生产过程和资源而非产品本身。需要将产品生命周期末端阶段的影响整合到工程阶段。

Method: 采用PPR建模范式，提出PoPAN模型作为产品的数字影子，封装在资产管理壳中，并使用AutomationML数据格式进行序列化。

Result: 通过电动汽车电池拆解用例验证了模型的有效性，支持电池再制造用于固定式电池应用。

Conclusion: PoPAN模型能够伴随产品整个生命周期，为维修、再制造和升级改造提供支持，有助于实现更可持续的产品生命周期管理。

Abstract: Current products, especially in the automotive sector, pose complex technical
systems having a multi-disciplinary mechatronic nature. Industrial standards
supporting system engineering and production typically (i) address the
production phase only, but do not cover the complete product life cycle, and
(ii) focus on production processes and resources rather than the products
themselves. The presented approach is motivated by incorporating impacts of
end-of-life phase of the product life cycle into the engineering phase. This
paper proposes a modelling approach coming up from the Product-Process-Resource
(PPR) modeling paradigm. It combines requirements on (i) respecting the product
structure as a basis for the model, and (ii) it incorporates repairing,
remanufacturing, or upcycling within cyber-physical production systems. The
proposed model called PoPAN should accompany the product during the entire life
cycle as a digital shadow encapsulated within the Asset Administration Shell of
a product. To facilitate the adoption of the proposed paradigm, the paper also
proposes serialization of the model in the AutomationML data format. The model
is demonstrated on a use-case for disassembling electric vehicle batteries to
support their remanufacturing for stationary battery applications.

Result: 在标准化基准和自定义控制感知平台上的大量实验验证了理论结果，这些方法实现了强大的近似保证并支持实时部署

Conclusion: 该框架通过多项式时间近似算法有效解决了视觉惯性导航中的NP难问题，在保证性能的同时显著降低了计算复杂度

Abstract: This paper presents a task-oriented computational framework to enhance
Visual-Inertial Navigation (VIN) in robots, addressing challenges such as
limited time and energy resources. The framework strategically selects visual
features using a Mean Squared Error (MSE)-based, non-submodular objective
function and a simplified dynamic anticipation model. To address the
NP-hardness of this problem, we introduce four polynomial-time approximation
algorithms: a classic greedy method with constant-factor guarantees; a low-rank
greedy variant that significantly reduces computational complexity; a
randomized greedy sampler that balances efficiency and solution quality; and a
linearization-based selector based on a first-order Taylor expansion for
near-constant-time execution. We establish rigorous performance bounds by
leveraging submodularity ratios, curvature, and element-wise curvature
analyses. Extensive experiments on both standardized benchmarks and a custom
control-aware platform validate our theoretical results, demonstrating that
these methods achieve strong approximation guarantees while enabling real-time
deployment.

Method: GPC方法：理论证明扩散模型分布分数的凸组合可产生更优的单步目标，通过Grönwall型边界证明改进可传播到整个轨迹；实践中通过凸组合和测试时搜索组合预训练策略

Result: 在Robomimic、PushT、RoboTwin基准测试和真实机器人评估中，GPC持续提升性能和适应性，组合策略性能超过任一父策略

Conclusion: GPC是一种简单有效的控制性能提升方法，可灵活组合异构策略，无需额外训练

Abstract: Diffusion-based models for robotic control, including vision-language-action
(VLA) and vision-action (VA) policies, have demonstrated significant
capabilities. Yet their advancement is constrained by the high cost of
acquiring large-scale interaction datasets. This work introduces an alternative
paradigm for enhancing policy performance without additional model training.
Perhaps surprisingly, we demonstrate that the composed policies can exceed the
performance of either parent policy. Our contribution is threefold. First, we
establish a theoretical foundation showing that the convex composition of
distributional scores from multiple diffusion models can yield a superior
one-step functional objective compared to any individual score. A
Gr\"onwall-type bound is then used to show that this single-step improvement
propagates through entire generation trajectories, leading to systemic
performance gains. Second, motivated by these results, we propose General
Policy Composition (GPC), a training-free method that enhances performance by
combining the distributional scores of multiple pre-trained policies via a
convex combination and test-time search. GPC is versatile, allowing for the
plug-and-play composition of heterogeneous policies, including VA and VLA
models, as well as those based on diffusion or flow-matching, irrespective of
their input visual modalities. Third, we provide extensive empirical
validation. Experiments on Robomimic, PushT, and RoboTwin benchmarks, alongside
real-world robotic evaluations, confirm that GPC consistently improves
performance and adaptability across a diverse set of tasks. Further analysis of
alternative composition operators and weighting strategies offers insights into
the mechanisms underlying the success of GPC. These results establish GPC as a
simple yet effective method for improving control performance by leveraging
existing policies.

Motivation: 当前跳跃机器人无法直接控制空中轨迹或过渡到飞行状态，这限制了跳跃系统的效率优势。需要开发能够控制复杂空中轨迹的方法。

Method: 采用非线性阻力补偿的轨迹生成方法和基于李雅普诺夫稳定性的控制器，确保机器人能够从起飞到降落跟踪复杂轨迹，并严格控制着陆时的姿态。

Result: 该系统能够使跳跃机器人在水平和垂直表面上执行复杂的空中轨迹，同时保持对着陆姿态的精确控制，计算效率高，适用于各种尺寸的跳跃机器人。

Conclusion: 该方法为跳跃机器人提供了轨迹控制能力，实现了从起飞到降落的完整轨迹跟踪，同时保持了跳跃系统的效率优势，具有广泛的适用性。

Abstract: The advent of rotor-based hopping robots has created very capable hopping
platforms with high agility and efficiency, and similar controllability, as
compared to their purely flying quadrotor counterparts. Advances in robot
performance have increased the hopping height to greater than 4 meters and
opened up the possibility for more complex aerial trajectories (i.e.,
behaviors). However, currently hopping robots do not directly control their
aerial trajectory or transition to flight, eliminating the efficiency benefits
of a hopping system. Here we show a real-time, computationally efficiency,
non-linear drag compensated, trajectory generation methodology and accompanying
Lyapunov-based controller. The combined system can create and follow complex
aerial trajectories from liftoff to touchdown on horizontal and vertical
surfaces, while maintaining strick control over the orientation at touchdown.
The computational efficiency provides broad applicability across all size
scales of hopping robots while maintaining applicability to quadrotors in
general.

Motivation: 当前RAG系统评估缺乏系统化方法来确保测试集充分覆盖知识库内容，导致开发者存在盲点，需要量化测试问题的语义覆盖度。

Conclusion: 为RAG开发者提供了构建更健壮测试套件的关键工具，提高了系统可靠性，并可扩展到识别文档对齐错误等应用场景。

Abstract: Reliably determining the performance of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
systems depends on comprehensive test questions. While a proliferation of
evaluation frameworks for LLM-powered applications exists, current practices
lack a systematic method to ensure these test sets adequately cover the
underlying knowledge base, leaving developers with significant blind spots. To
address this, we present a novel, applied methodology to quantify the semantic
coverage of RAG test questions against their underlying documents. Our approach
leverages existing technologies, including vector embeddings and clustering
algorithms, to create a practical framework for validating test
comprehensiveness. Our methodology embeds document chunks and test questions
into a unified vector space, enabling the calculation of multiple coverage
metrics: basic proximity, content-weighted coverage, and multi-topic question
coverage. Furthermore, we incorporate outlier detection to filter irrelevant
questions, allowing for the refinement of test sets. Experimental evidence from
two distinct use cases demonstrates that our framework effectively quantifies
test coverage, identifies specific content areas with inadequate
representation, and provides concrete recommendations for generating new,
high-value test questions. This work provides RAG developers with essential
tools to build more robust test suites, thereby improving system reliability
and extending to applications such as identifying misaligned documents.

Motivation: 当前最先进的机器学习原子间势能模型通过等变神经网络架构强制实现旋转平移对称性，这种硬编码的归纳偏置往往导致灵活性、计算效率和可扩展性降低。

Method: 提出TransIP训练范式，通过优化嵌入空间表示来引导通用非等变Transformer模型学习SO(3)等变性，无需显式架构约束。

Conclusion: 学习得到的等变性可以成为等变或基于数据增强的MLIP模型的有力且高效替代方案。

Abstract: Accurate and scalable machine-learned inter-atomic potentials (MLIPs) are
essential for molecular simulations ranging from drug discovery to new material
design. Current state-of-the-art models enforce roto-translational symmetries
through equivariant neural network architectures, a hard-wired inductive bias
that can often lead to reduced flexibility, computational efficiency, and
scalability. In this work, we introduce TransIP: Transformer-based Inter-Atomic
Potentials, a novel training paradigm for interatomic potentials achieving
symmetry compliance without explicit architectural constraints. Our approach
guides a generic non-equivariant Transformer-based model to learn
SO(3)-equivariance by optimizing its representations in the embedding space.
Trained on the recent Open Molecules (OMol25) collection, a large and diverse
molecular dataset built specifically for MLIPs and covering different types of
molecules (including small organics, biomolecular fragments, and
electrolyte-like species), TransIP attains comparable performance in
machine-learning force fields versus state-of-the-art equivariant baselines.
Further, compared to a data augmentation baseline, TransIP achieves 40% to 60%
improvement in performance across varying OMol25 dataset sizes. More broadly,
our work shows that learned equivariance can be a powerful and efficient
alternative to equivariant or augmentation-based MLIP models.

TL;DR: 该论文分析了RoPE位置插值与后训练量化结合时的精度下降问题，提出了Q-ROAR方法来解决这一问题，通过分组频率带和轻量级搜索来稳定量化LLM的长上下文性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展大语言模型的上下文窗口对于处理长距离依赖任务至关重要，但RoPE位置插值与后训练量化结合会导致精度下降，需要系统分析和解决方案。

Method: 提出Q-ROAR方法：将RoPE维度分组到少量频率带，对Key和Query权重进行轻量级的逐带尺度搜索，使用插值压力和尾部膨胀比作为诊断指标，无需微调或架构改变。

Result: Q-ROAR在长上下文工作负载上使模型困惑度降低超过14%，同时保持短上下文性能、推理吞吐量和现有LLM系统栈兼容性。

Conclusion: Q-ROAR有效解决了RoPE插值与量化结合时的精度问题，为量化LLM的长上下文支持提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Extending the context window support of large language models (LLMs) is
crucial for tasks with long-distance dependencies. RoPE-based interpolation and
extrapolation methods, such as linear scaling and frequency-aware schemes,
enable longer input length support without retraining, while post-training
quantization (PTQ) makes deployment practical. However, we show that combining
RoPE position interpolation (PI) with PTQ degrades accuracy due to coupled
effects including long-context aliasing, dynamic-range dilation, anisotropy
from axis-aligned quantizers vs. rotated RoPE pairs, and outlier shifting that
produces position-dependent logit noise. We provide, to the best of our
knowledge, the first systematic analysis of the PI+PTQ approach and introduce
two practical diagnostics: interpolation pressure (per-band sensitivity to
phase scaling) and tail-inflation ratios (outlier shift from short to long
contexts). Following the analysis results, we propose Q-ROAR (Quantization,
RoPE-interpolation, and Outlier Aware Rescaling), a weight-only,
interpolation-aware stabilization of PI for quantized LLMs. Q-ROAR groups RoPE
dimensions into a small number of frequency bands and performs a lightweight
search over per-band scales for Key and Query weights (with an optional
symmetric variant to preserve logit scale). The search is guided by our
diagnostics and uses a tiny long-context development dataset, requiring no
fine-tuning to the model, no architecture or kernel changes, and no additional
deployment overhead. Empirically, Q-ROAR reduces the model's perplexity on
long-context workloads by more than 14%, while preserving short-context
performance, inference throughput, and compatibility with existing LLM system
stacks.

Abstract: We present DexBench, the first benchmark designed to evaluate large language
model (LLM) performance across real-world decision-making tasks faced by
individuals managing diabetes in their daily lives. Unlike prior health
benchmarks that are either generic, clinician-facing or focused on clinical
tasks (e.g., diagnosis, triage), DexBench introduces a comprehensive evaluation
framework tailored to the unique challenges of prototyping patient-facing AI
solutions in diabetes, glucose management, metabolic health and related
domains. Our benchmark encompasses 7 distinct task categories, reflecting the
breadth of real-world questions individuals with diabetes ask, including basic
glucose interpretation, educational queries, behavioral associations, advanced
decision making and long term planning. Towards this end, we compile a rich
dataset comprising one month of time-series data encompassing glucose traces
and metrics from continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) and behavioral logs (e.g.,
eating and activity patterns) from 15,000 individuals across three different
diabetes populations (type 1, type 2, pre-diabetes/general health and
wellness). Using this data, we generate a total of 360,600 personalized,
contextual questions across the 7 tasks. We evaluate model performance on these
tasks across 5 metrics: accuracy, groundedness, safety, clarity and
actionability. Our analysis of 8 recent LLMs reveals substantial variability
across tasks and metrics; no single model consistently outperforms others
across all dimensions. By establishing this benchmark, we aim to advance the
reliability, safety, effectiveness and practical utility of AI solutions in
diabetes care.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了在p-adic度量空间中进行机器学习的理论基础，证明p-adic度量能更好地捕捉层次数据的离散分支特性，并通过自然语言处理应用验证其实际意义。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统机器学习方法使用欧几里得度量，无法有效处理层次数据的离散分支特性，需要更适合层次结构的数据表示方法。

Method: 建立p-adic度量空间的数学理论框架，证明在p-adic空间中n维平面最小化距离时必须通过至少n+1个数据点，与欧几里得回归形成鲜明对比。

Result: 证明了p-adic回归的离散特性：n次多项式最小化p-adic残差和时必定通过至少n+1个数据点，这更符合层次数据的本质。

Conclusion: p-adic度量可能是处理机器学习中层次数据结构的基本工具，在层次数据中，选择实际观测点作为代表比插值更有意义。

Abstract: Many real-world machine learning problems involve inherently hierarchical
data, yet traditional approaches rely on Euclidean metrics that fail to capture
the discrete, branching nature of hierarchical relationships. We present a
theoretical foundation for machine learning in p-adic metric spaces, which
naturally respect hierarchical structure. Our main result proves that an
n-dimensional plane minimizing the p-adic sum of distances to points in a
dataset must pass through at least n + 1 of those points -- a striking contrast
to Euclidean regression that highlights how p-adic metrics better align with
the discrete nature of hierarchical data. As a corollary, a polynomial of
degree n constructed to minimise the p-adic sum of residuals will pass through
at least n + 1 points. As a further corollary, a polynomial of degree n
approximating a higher degree polynomial at a finite number of points will
yield a difference polynomial that has distinct rational roots. We demonstrate
the practical significance of this result through two applications in natural
language processing: analyzing hierarchical taxonomies and modeling grammatical
morphology. These results suggest that p-adic metrics may be fundamental to
properly handling hierarchical data structures in machine learning. In
hierarchical data, interpolation between points often makes less sense than
selecting actual observed points as representatives.

TL;DR: FedLLM-Align：利用预训练大语言模型作为通用特征提取器，解决联邦学习中表格数据异构性问题的框架，无需手动模式对齐，在隐私保护和通信效率方面表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习在隐私敏感领域具有吸引力，但表格数据的异构性（不同模式和特征空间）阻碍了直接聚合，需要解决模式差异问题。

Method: 将表格记录序列化为文本，使用DistilBERT、ALBERT、RoBERTa和ClinicalBERT等预训练LLM作为通用特征提取器生成语义对齐的表示，在标准FedAvg协议下支持轻量级本地分类器。

Result: 在冠心病预测任务中，所有客户端设置和LLM骨干网络下均优于最先进基线，F1分数提升高达+0.25，通信成本降低65%，在极端模式差异下表现出优雅降级。

Conclusion: FedLLM-Align是异构环境中联邦学习的鲁棒、隐私保护和通信高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training without sharing
raw data, making it attractive for privacy-sensitive domains such as
healthcare, finance, and IoT. A major obstacle, however, is the heterogeneity
of tabular data across clients, where divergent schemas and incompatible
feature spaces prevent straightforward aggregation. To address this challenge,
we propose FedLLM-Align, a federated framework that leverages pre-trained large
language models (LLMs) as universal feature extractors. Tabular records are
serialized into text, and embeddings from models such as DistilBERT, ALBERT,
RoBERTa, and ClinicalBERT provide semantically aligned representations that
support lightweight local classifiers under the standard FedAvg protocol. This
approach removes the need for manual schema harmonization while preserving
privacy, since raw data remain strictly local. We evaluate FedLLM-Align on
coronary heart disease prediction using partitioned Framingham datasets with
simulated schema divergence. Across all client settings and LLM backbones, our
method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to
+0.25 improvement in F1-score and a 65% reduction in communication cost. Stress
testing under extreme schema divergence further demonstrates graceful
degradation, unlike traditional methods that collapse entirely. These results
establish FedLLM-Align as a robust, privacy-preserving, and
communication-efficient solution for federated learning in heterogeneous
environments.

Abstract: Foundation models have reshaped AI by unifying fragmented architectures into
scalable backbones with multimodal reasoning and contextual adaptation. In
parallel, the long-standing notion of AI agents, defined by the
sensing-decision-action loop, is entering a new paradigm: with FMs as their
cognitive core, agents transcend rule-based behaviors to achieve autonomy,
generalization, and self-reflection. This dual shift is reinforced by
real-world demands such as autonomous driving, robotics, virtual assistants,
and GUI agents, as well as ecosystem advances in embedded hardware, edge
computing, mobile deployment platforms, and communication protocols that
together enable large-scale deployment. Yet this convergence collides with
reality: while applications demand long-term adaptability and real-time
interaction, mobile and edge deployments remain constrained by memory, energy,
bandwidth, and latency. This creates a fundamental tension between the growing
complexity of FMs and the limited resources of deployment environments. This
survey provides the first systematic characterization of adaptive,
resource-efficient agentic AI systems. We summarize enabling techniques into
elastic inference, test-time adaptation, dynamic multimodal integration, and
agentic AI applications, and identify open challenges in balancing
accuracy-latency-communication trade-offs and sustaining robustness under
distribution shifts. We further highlight future opportunities in
algorithm-system co-design, cognitive adaptation, and collaborative edge
deployment. By mapping FM structures, cognition, and hardware resources, this
work establishes a unified perspective toward scalable, adaptive, and
resource-efficient agentic AI. We believe this survey can help readers to
understand the connections between enabling technologies while promoting
further discussions on the fusion of agentic intelligence and intelligent
agents.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种近似单峰似然模型来解决序数回归问题，该模型能够表示单峰条件概率分布和接近单峰的分布，以缓解传统单峰模型对非单峰数据的偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多现实世界的序数数据虽然通常呈现单峰条件概率分布，但也存在部分非单峰分布的情况。传统的单峰似然模型在处理这些非单峰数据时会产生偏差，因此需要开发能够更灵活处理这两种情况的模型。

Result: 实验验证表明，所提出的模型在序数数据的统计建模和序数回归任务中具有有效性。

Conclusion: 近似单峰似然模型通过平衡单峰假设的严格性和灵活性，能够更有效地处理现实世界序数数据的多样性，提高序数回归任务的性能。

Abstract: Ordinal regression (OR, also called ordinal classification) is classification
of ordinal data, in which the underlying target variable is categorical and
considered to have a natural ordinal relation for the underlying explanatory
variable. A key to successful OR models is to find a data structure `natural
ordinal relation' common to many ordinal data and reflect that structure into
the design of those models. A recent OR study found that many real-world
ordinal data show a tendency that the conditional probability distribution
(CPD) of the target variable given a value of the explanatory variable will
often be unimodal. Several previous studies thus developed unimodal likelihood
models, in which a predicted CPD is guaranteed to become unimodal. However, it
was also observed experimentally that many real-world ordinal data partly have
values of the explanatory variable where the underlying CPD will be
non-unimodal, and hence unimodal likelihood models may suffer from a bias for
such a CPD. Therefore, motivated to mitigate such a bias, we propose
approximately unimodal likelihood models, which can represent up to a unimodal
CPD and a CPD that is close to be unimodal. We also verify experimentally that
a proposed model can be effective for statistical modeling of ordinal data and
OR tasks.

Abstract: We introduce BigBang-Proton, a unified sequence-based architecture for
auto-regressive language modeling pretrained on cross-scale, cross-structure,
cross-discipline real-world scientific tasks to construct a scientific
multi-task learner. BigBang-Proton incorporates three fundamental innovations
compared to mainstream general-purpose LLMs: Theory-Experiment Learning
paradigm aligns large-scale numerical experimental data with theoretical text
corpora; Binary Patch Encoding replaces byte pair encoding(BPE) tokenization;
Monte Carlo Attention substitutes traditional transformer architectures.
Through next-word-prediction pretraining on cross-discipline scientific
datasets of real-world problems mixed with general textual corpus, followed by
fine-tuning and inference on downstream tasks, BigBang-Proton demonstrates
100\% accuracy in up to 50-digit arithmetic addition operations, performance on
par with leading specialized models in particle physics jet tagging, matching
MAE of specialized models in inter-atomic potential simulation, performance
comparable to traditional spatiotemporal models in water quality prediction,
and benchmark-exceeding performance in genome modeling. These results prove
that language-guided scientific computing can match or exceed the performance
of task-specific scientific models while maintaining multitask learning
capabilities. We further hypothesize to scale the pretraining to the universe
scale as a fundamental step toward developing material world foundational
model.

TL;DR: 提出NeurTransformer方法，通过将transformer模型转换为脉冲神经网络(SNN)，解决传统transformer模型在训练和部署时计算复杂度高的问题，显著提升能效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统transformer模型在训练和部署时存在计算复杂度高的问题，时间空间复杂度与输入序列长度呈二次关系。现有SNN训练方法效率低下，转换方法存在延迟问题。

Method: 1) 用脉冲自注意力(SSA)替换自注意力机制；2) 将训练好的transformer模型的feed-forward块转换为等效SNN；3) 使用SNN代理学习算法微调SSA块。

Result: 转换后的GPT-2小模型在余弦相似度上损失5-12%，困惑度降低9.7%。SSA块相比ASA块在数字硬件上实现自注意力机制时，能耗降低64.71%-85.28%。

Conclusion: NeurTransformer方法成功将transformer模型转换为SNN，在保持性能的同时显著提升能效，为大规模transformer模型的能效部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Foundational models based on the transformer architecture are currently the
state-of-the-art in general language modeling, as well as in scientific areas
such as material science and climate. However, training and deploying these
models is computationally challenging as the time and space complexity has a
quadratic relation to the input sequence length. Several efforts exploring
efficient computational paradigms and model architectures to address these
limitations have been made. In this work, we explore spiking neural networks
(SNNs) to design transformer models. A challenge in training large-scale SNNs,
using existing surrogate learning methods is inefficient and time-consuming. On
the other hand, techniques to convert existing transformer-based models to
their SNN equivalent are not scalable, as achieving optimal performance comes
at the cost of a large number of spike time-steps, i.e. increased latency. To
address this, we propose NeurTransformer, a methodology for designing
transformer-based SNN for inference using a supervised fine-tuning approach
with existing conversion methods. The proposed methodology works by: (1)
replacing the self-attention mechanism with a spike-based self-attention (SSA),
(2) converting the feed-forward block of the trained transformer model to its
equivalent SNN, and (3) fine-tuning the SSA block using SNN-based surrogate
learning algorithms. We benchmark the proposed methodology and demonstrate its
accuracy and scalability using three variants of the GPT-2 model of increasing
model size. We observe that the converted GPT-2 small models demonstrate a
5-12% loss in cosine similarity and a 9.7% reduction in perplexity. Finally, we
demonstrate the energy efficiency of the SSA block compared to the ASA block
and show between 64.71% and 85.28% reductions in estimated energy consumption
when implementing the self-attention mechanism on a digital hardware.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类通过比较不同观察来学习概念，这种认知机制对机器学习同样重要，可以为概念学习领域提供正确性保证，弥补当前缺乏通用理论支持的不足。

Method: 开发了一个理论框架，通过多类别观察数据的比较来识别隐藏概念，即使条件不全局满足，也能基于局部比较提供替代保证。

Result: 理论验证表明，在类别足够多样的情况下，可以识别隐藏概念和类别-概念间的隐藏结构，无需特定假设。

Conclusion: 比较机制是概念学习的关键，提出的理论框架为概念识别提供了非参数化的正确性保证，扩展了概念学习的适用范围。

Abstract: We are born with the ability to learn concepts by comparing diverse
observations. This helps us to understand the new world in a compositional
manner and facilitates extrapolation, as objects naturally consist of multiple
concepts. In this work, we argue that the cognitive mechanism of comparison,
fundamental to human learning, is also vital for machines to recover true
concepts underlying the data. This offers correctness guarantees for the field
of concept learning, which, despite its impressive empirical successes, still
lacks general theoretical support. Specifically, we aim to develop a
theoretical framework for the identifiability of concepts with multiple classes
of observations. We show that with sufficient diversity across classes, hidden
concepts can be identified without assuming specific concept types, functional
relations, or parametric generative models. Interestingly, even when conditions
are not globally satisfied, we can still provide alternative guarantees for as
many concepts as possible based on local comparisons, thereby extending the
applicability of our theory to more flexible scenarios. Moreover, the hidden
structure between classes and concepts can also be identified
nonparametrically. We validate our theoretical results in both synthetic and
real-world settings.

TL;DR: 本文研究了在有限反馈下强化学习的奖励选择问题（RLLF），探索了如何选择最有影响力的样本来标注奖励，以最大化策略性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在实际问题中，由于计算或经济限制，获取大量奖励标签往往不可行。当强化学习必须在有限反馈下进行时，需要确定哪些样本应该被标注奖励才能最大化策略性能。

Method: 研究了两种选择策略：(i) 依赖无奖励信息的启发式方法，如状态访问和部分价值函数；(ii) 使用辅助评估反馈预训练的策略。

Result: 发现关键的奖励子集是那些能够引导智能体沿最优轨迹前进，并在偏离后支持恢复接近最优行为的奖励。有效的选择方法可以用比完全监督少得多的奖励标签获得接近最优的策略。

Conclusion: 奖励选择是在反馈受限环境中扩展强化学习的有力范式，能够显著减少所需的奖励标签数量。

Abstract: The ability of reinforcement learning algorithms to learn effective policies
is determined by the rewards available during training. However, for practical
problems, obtaining large quantities of reward labels is often infeasible due
to computational or financial constraints, particularly when relying on human
feedback. When reinforcement learning must proceed with limited feedback --
only a fraction of samples get rewards labeled -- a fundamental question
arises: which samples should be labeled to maximize policy performance? We
formalize this problem of reward selection for reinforcement learning from
limited feedback (RLLF), introducing a new problem formulation that facilitates
the study of strategies for selecting impactful rewards. Two types of selection
strategies are investigated: (i) heuristics that rely on reward-free
information such as state visitation and partial value functions, and (ii)
strategies pre-trained using auxiliary evaluative feedback. We find that
critical subsets of rewards are those that (1) guide the agent along optimal
trajectories, and (2) support recovery toward near-optimal behavior after
deviations. Effective selection methods yield near-optimal policies with
significantly fewer reward labels than full supervision, establishing reward
selection as a powerful paradigm for scaling reinforcement learning in
feedback-limited settings.

Motivation: AI决策系统在关键领域的广泛应用引发了对算法公平性的担忧，但由于只能获取算法输出而无法了解内部机制，评估反事实公平性度量面临挑战。

Method: 使用部分识别方法，从观测数据中推导反事实公平性度量的信息边界，并引入贝叶斯方法来高置信度地界定未知的反事实公平性度量。

Result: 在COMPAS数据集上的实验显示，将种族改为非洲裔美国人会对COMPAS分数产生正向（虚假）影响，而从年轻到年老的转变则产生负向（直接因果）影响。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效评估反事实公平性，为算法公平性评估提供了实用的工具，特别是在目标反事实度量不可识别的情况下。

Abstract: The wide adoption of AI decision-making systems in critical domains such as
criminal justice, loan approval, and hiring processes has heightened concerns
about algorithmic fairness. As we often only have access to the output of
algorithms without insights into their internal mechanisms, it was natural to
examine how decisions would alter when auxiliary sensitive attributes (such as
race) change. This led the research community to come up with counterfactual
fairness measures, but how to evaluate the measure from available data remains
a challenging task. In many practical applications, the target counterfactual
measure is not identifiable, i.e., it cannot be uniquely determined from the
combination of quantitative data and qualitative knowledge. This paper
addresses this challenge using partial identification, which derives
informative bounds over counterfactual fairness measures from observational
data. We introduce a Bayesian approach to bound unknown counterfactual fairness
measures with high confidence. We demonstrate our algorithm on the COMPAS
dataset, examining fairness in recidivism risk scores with respect to race,
age, and sex. Our results reveal a positive (spurious) effect on the COMPAS
score when changing race to African-American (from all others) and a negative
(direct causal) effect when transitioning from young to old age.

Result: 发现成功模型通过注意力形成Minkowski和来表示部分乘积，使用傅里叶基表示数字，而标准微调模型缺乏这些高效表示并收敛到缺乏必要长程依赖的局部最优解。

Conclusion: 通过逆向工程揭示了Transformers学习长程依赖的陷阱，并展示了正确归纳偏置如何解决这一问题，为改进语言模型在复杂推理任务上的表现提供了洞见。

Abstract: Language models are increasingly capable, yet still fail at a seemingly
simple task of multi-digit multiplication. In this work, we study why, by
reverse-engineering a model that successfully learns multiplication via
\emph{implicit chain-of-thought}, and report three findings: (1) Evidence of
long-range structure: Logit attributions and linear probes indicate that the
model encodes the necessary long-range dependencies for multi-digit
multiplication. (2) Mechanism: the model encodes long-range dependencies using
attention to construct a directed acyclic graph to ``cache'' and ``retrieve''
pairwise partial products. (3) Geometry: the model implements partial products
in attention heads by forming Minkowski sums between pairs of digits, and
digits are represented using a Fourier basis, both of which are intuitive and
efficient representations that the standard fine-tuning model lacks. With these
insights, we revisit the learning dynamics of standard fine-tuning and find
that the model converges to a local optimum that lacks the required long-range
dependencies. We further validate this understanding by introducing an
auxiliary loss that predicts the ``running sum'' via a linear regression probe,
which provides an inductive bias that enables the model to successfully learn
multi-digit multiplication. In summary, by reverse-engineering the mechanisms
of an implicit chain-of-thought model we uncover a pitfall for learning
long-range dependencies in Transformers and provide an example of how the
correct inductive bias can address this issue.

Motivation: LoRA的参数高效微调能力虽然广泛使用，但其表示能力往往落后于全参数微调。关键问题是如何从过参数化空间中获得表达性强的低秩适配器

Method: 提出PrunedLoRA框架，通过结构化剪枝动态修剪不重要组件并防止其重新激活，实现灵活的自适应秩分配。采用基于梯度的剪枝策略，最小化整体损失的剪枝误差

Result: 在数学推理、代码生成和自然语言理解等监督微调任务中，PrunedLoRA始终优于LoRA及其变体，并在不同稀疏度水平下优于现有结构化剪枝方法

Conclusion: PrunedLoRA通过结构化剪枝有效提升了低秩适配器的表示能力，为参数高效微调提供了更优的解决方案

Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) has become a widely used paradigm for
parameter-efficient fine-tuning of large language models, yet its
representational capacity often lags behind full fine-tuning. Within the
context of LoRA, a key open question is how to obtain expressive low-rank
adapters from over-parameterized spaces. We propose \textit{PrunedLoRA}, a new
framework that leverages structured pruning to obtain highly representative
low-rank adapters from an over-parameterized initialization. Unlike prior
approaches that impose a fixed low-rank budget, PrunedLoRA dynamically prunes
less important components during fine-tuning and prevents their reactivation,
enabling flexible and adaptive rank allocation. For structured pruning, by
minimizing the pruning error for overall loss, we provide fine-grained pruning
and recovery updates in a gradient-based pruning strategy with grounded
interpretation. We provide the first theoretical analysis of the robustness of
structured pruning and provably show that under the impact of weight
perturbation, gradient-based pruning is more robust than activation-based
pruning with respect to overall loss. Empirically, PrunedLoRA consistently
outperforms LoRA and its variants across supervised fine-tuning tasks in
mathematical reasoning, code generation, and natural language understanding,
and it also demonstrates advantages over existing structured pruning methods
across diverse sparsity levels.

Motivation: GRPO缺乏显式奖励或评论家模型，限制了其在token序列间进行细粒度信用分配的能力。

Method: 使用token级对数概率重新表述资格迹，引入无评论家的时序差分误差近似，并提出几种λ-return加权变体。

Result: 在1.5B到7B参数的模型上，RL训练期间性能提升30-40%，在多个数学推理数据集上平均性能比GRPO提升3-4.5点。

Conclusion: GRPO-λ通过改进信用分配机制，显著提升了LLM在复杂推理任务中的RL微调效果。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed for tasks requiring
complex reasoning, prompting significant interest in improving their reasoning
abilities through post-training. Especially RL based methods using verifiable
reward, like the state-of-the-art GRPO, have shown to tremendously improve
reasoning behaviors when applied as post-training methods. However, the lack of
an explicit reward or critic model limits GRPO's ability to assign fine-grained
credit across token sequences. In this work, we present GRPO-$\lambda$, a novel
extension to GRPO that enhances credit assignment in RL finetuning of LLMs for
complex reasoning tasks. We approximate learning from $\lambda$-return with a
reformulation of eligibility traces using token-level log-probabilities applied
after each sequence generation, and a novel critic-free approximation of the
temporal-difference error. We introduce a few variations for the weighting of
the $\lambda$-return, and their applications to the eligibility-trace, where
all the variations provide significant gains over GRPO. We compare
GRPO-$\lambda$ against GRPO by training models from 1.5B to 7B parameters on
$4$ different math reasoning datasets. The training plots demonstrate 30-40%
improved performance during RL training on both LLaMA-3.1 and Qwen-2.5
architectures. Finally, we show that with GRPO-$\lambda$, the resulting average
performance on AIME24, Math500, OlympiadMath, MinervaMath, and AMC improves
over GRPO by over $3$ points and a $4.5$ points improvement on the 7B model.

Abstract: Today's LLM ecosystem comprises a wide spectrum of models that differ in
size, capability, and cost. No single model is optimal for all scenarios;
hence, LLM routers have become essential for selecting the most appropriate
model under varying circumstances. However, the rapid emergence of various
routers makes choosing the right one increasingly challenging. To address this
problem, we need a comprehensive router comparison and a standardized
leaderboard, similar to those available for models. In this work, we introduce
RouterArena, the first open platform enabling comprehensive comparison of LLM
routers. RouterArena has (1) a principally constructed dataset with broad
knowledge domain coverage, (2) distinguishable difficulty levels for each
domain, (3) an extensive list of evaluation metrics, and (4) an automated
framework for leaderboard updates. Leveraging our framework, we have produced
the initial leaderboard with detailed metrics comparison as shown in Figure 1.
We will make our platform open to the public soon.

in existing LoRA fine-tuning systems. First, they incur substantial runtime
overhead due to redundant memory accesses on large activation tensors. Second,
they miss the opportunity to concurrently fine-tune multiple independent LoRA
adapters that share the same base model on the same set of GPUs. This leads to
missed performance gains such as reduced pipeline bubbles, better communication
overlap, and improved GPU load balance.
  To address these issues, we introduce LoRAFusion, an efficient LoRA
fine-tuning system for LLMs. At the kernel level, we propose a graph-splitting
method that fuses memory-bound operations. This design eliminates unnecessary
memory accesses and preserves the performance of compute-bound GEMMs without
incurring the cost of recomputation or synchronization. At the scheduling
level, LoRAFusion introduces an adaptive batching algorithm for multi-job
fine-tuning. It first splits LoRA adapters into groups to intentionally stagger
batch execution across jobs, and then solves a bin-packing problem within each
group to generate balanced, dependency-aware microbatches. LoRAFusion achieves
up to $1.96\times$ ($1.47\times$ on average) end-to-end speedup compared to
Megatron-LM, and up to $1.46\times$ ($1.29\times$ on average) improvement over
mLoRA, the state-of-the-art multi-LoRA fine-tuning system. Our fused kernel
achieves up to $1.39\times$ ($1.27\times$ on average) kernel performance
improvement and can directly serve as a plug-and-play replacement in existing
LoRA systems. We open-source LoRAFusion at

*Yang Zhang,Huiwen Yan,Mushuang Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Directed-MAML算法，通过任务导向的一阶近似来加速元强化学习中的二阶梯度计算，提高计算效率和收敛速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MAML在元强化学习应用中面临二阶梯度计算带来的计算和内存开销大、嵌套优化结构复杂导致收敛困难的问题。

Method: 在二阶梯度步骤前应用额外的一阶任务导向近似来估计二阶梯度效果，从而加速收敛并减少计算成本。

Result: 在CartPole-v1、LunarLander-v2和双车辆交叉路口场景中，Directed-MAML在计算效率和收敛速度上优于基于MAML的基线方法。

Conclusion: 任务导向近似可有效集成到其他元学习算法中，如FOMAML和Meta-SGD，提升计算效率和收敛速度。

Abstract: Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) is a versatile meta-learning framework
applicable to both supervised learning and reinforcement learning (RL).
However, applying MAML to meta-reinforcement learning (meta-RL) presents
notable challenges. First, MAML relies on second-order gradient computations,
leading to significant computational and memory overhead. Second, the nested
structure of optimization increases the problem's complexity, making
convergence to a global optimum more challenging. To overcome these
limitations, we propose Directed-MAML, a novel task-directed meta-RL algorithm.
Before the second-order gradient step, Directed-MAML applies an additional
first-order task-directed approximation to estimate the effect of second-order
gradients, thereby accelerating convergence to the optimum and reducing
computational cost. Experimental results demonstrate that Directed-MAML
surpasses MAML-based baselines in computational efficiency and convergence
speed in the scenarios of CartPole-v1, LunarLander-v2 and two-vehicle
intersection crossing. Furthermore, we show that task-directed approximation
can be effectively integrated into other meta-learning algorithms, such as
First-Order Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (FOMAML) and Meta Stochastic Gradient
Descent(Meta-SGD), yielding improved computational efficiency and convergence
speed.

*Houjun Liu,Shikhar Murty,Christopher D. Manning,Róbert Csordás*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Thoughtbubbles是一种transformer变体，通过在潜在空间中学习分叉或删除残差流来执行并行自适应计算，使需要大量计算的token能在网络中间形成"气泡"进行额外思考。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于显式思维链token的方法存在局限性，无法在预训练阶段应用，且仅限于串行生成的自然语言表达。需要一种能在预训练期间学习自适应计算的方法。

Method: 提出Thoughtbubbles方法，让transformer在潜在空间中学习分叉或删除残差流，使token能形成"气泡"进行并行自适应计算，仅使用语言建模损失在预训练期间学习。

Result: 在OpenWebText和peS2o困惑度评估中优于标准解码器LM和非自适应并行计算方法，在HellaSwag和LAMBADA等零样本评估中也表现更好，在1.5亿到7.72亿参数规模上验证了有效性。

Conclusion: Thoughtbubbles的隐式特性使得自适应计算可以从预训练阶段开始学习，为统一训练和推理时行为铺平了道路。

Abstract: Current approaches for scaling inference-time compute in transformers rely on
training them to emit explicit chain-of-thought tokens before producing an
answer. While these methods are powerful, they are limited because they cannot
be applied during pretraining and are limited to only serially-generated,
natural-language verbalization to scale inference-time compute. In this work,
we propose Thoughtbubbles, a transformer variant that natively performs
parallel adaptive computation in latent space by learning to fork or delete
residual streams. Thus, tokens that require a large amount of computation can
form a "bubble" of cloned residuals in the middle of the network for additional
thinking. Crucially, this behavior is learned during pretraining with only
language modeling loss. Thoughtbubbles outperforms both standard decoder LMs as
well as non-adaptive parallel computation approaches on OpenWebText and peS2o
perplexity and in zero-shot evaluations such as HellaSwag and LAMBADA after
pretraining across 150M to 772M parameter scales. The implicit nature of our
method enables adaptive computation to be learned starting at pretraining time,
paving the way to unify train and test-time behavior for reasoning models.

TL;DR: KV缓存压缩虽然能提高吞吐量，但在多指令提示等实际场景中可能导致某些指令被完全忽略，特别是系统提示泄露问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究KV缓存压缩在实际部署中的潜在问题，特别是多指令提示场景下的性能下降和指令忽略现象。

Method: 通过实证研究分析压缩方法、指令顺序和KV驱逐偏差对提示泄露的影响，并提出改进的KV缓存驱逐策略。

Result: 发现某些指令在压缩后性能急剧下降，系统提示泄露问题突出，不同压缩方法和指令顺序影响显著。

Conclusion: KV缓存压缩需要谨慎部署，提出的驱逐策略改进可以减轻多指令任务中的负面影响。

Abstract: KV cache compression promises increased throughput and efficiency with
negligible loss in performance. While the gains in throughput are indisputable
and recent literature has indeed shown minimal degradation on particular
benchmarks, in general the consequences of compression in realistic scenarios
such as multi-instruction prompting have been insufficiently studied. In this
paper, we identify several pitfalls practitioners should be aware of when
deploying KV cache compressed LLMs. Importantly, we show that certain
instructions degrade much more rapidly with compression, effectively causing
them to be completely ignored by the LLM. As a practical example of that, we
highlight system prompt leakage as a case study, empirically showing the impact
of compression on leakage and general instruction following. We show several
factors that play a role in prompt leakage: compression method, instruction
order, and KV eviction bias. We then propose simple changes to KV cache
eviction policies that can reduce the impact of these factors and improve the
overall performance in multi-instruction tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学机器学习虽然能从高维时空流数据中提取物理洞察，但潜空间的可解释性仍然是一个挑战。需要构建物理可解释的潜空间来增强模型的可解释性。

Method: 基于神经算子构建DIANO框架，通过编码神经算子进行空间粗化压缩高维输入，通过解码神经算子进行空间细化重建原始输入。在潜空间中集成完全可微的PDE求解器，嵌入物理先验到潜动力学中。

Result: 在2D圆柱绕流、2D对称狭窄动脉血流和3D患者特异性冠状动脉等基准问题上验证了DIANO的能力，能够解决潜空间中的PDE，同时实现维度和几何降维，并保持潜空间可解释性。

Conclusion: DIANO框架成功构建了物理可解释的潜空间，能够在潜空间中求解PDE，为科学机器学习提供了增强可解释性的有效方法。

Abstract: Scientific machine learning has enabled the extraction of physical insights
from high-dimensional spatiotemporal flow data using linear and nonlinear
dimensionality reduction techniques. Despite these advances, achieving
interpretability within the latent space remains a challenge. To address this,
we propose the DIfferentiable Autoencoding Neural Operator (DIANO), a
deterministic autoencoding neural operator framework that constructs physically
interpretable latent spaces for both dimensional and geometric reduction, with
the provision to enforce differential governing equations directly within the
latent space. Built upon neural operators, DIANO compresses high-dimensional
input functions into a low-dimensional latent space via spatial coarsening
through an encoding neural operator and subsequently reconstructs the original
inputs using a decoding neural operator through spatial refinement. We assess
DIANO's latent space interpretability and performance in dimensionality
reduction against baseline models, including the Convolutional Neural Operator
and standard autoencoders. Furthermore, a fully differentiable partial
differential equation (PDE) solver is developed and integrated within the
latent space, enabling the temporal advancement of both high- and low-fidelity
PDEs, thereby embedding physical priors into the latent dynamics. We further
investigate various PDE formulations, including the 2D unsteady
advection-diffusion and the 3D Pressure-Poisson equation, to examine their
influence on shaping the latent flow representations. Benchmark problems
considered include flow past a 2D cylinder, flow through a 2D symmetric
stenosed artery, and a 3D patient-specific coronary artery. These case studies
demonstrate DIANO's capability to solve PDEs within a latent space that
facilitates both dimensional and geometrical reduction while allowing latent
interpretability.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种在自动微分框架中高效计算梯度统计信息的方法，通过AD图手术实现，在某些情况下几乎不增加计算和内存开销。重新研究了优化中的非线性操作，发现signSGD中符号操作的位置对成功至关重要，而Adam预处理器在优化中应更依赖梯度分布的均值而非方差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度学习训练算法将小批量样本视为单一对象，仅计算梯度平均值。作者认为计算其他梯度统计信息在自动微分框架中并非资源密集型，这为算法设计提供了新的可能性。

Method: 1. 通过自动微分图手术实现梯度统计计算，在某些情况下几乎无额外开销；2. 在JAX中使用向量化变换进行原型实现；3. 重新分析signSGD和Adam预处理器，通过每个样本梯度变换的视角进行研究。

Result: 1. 发现signSGD中符号操作的最佳位置对成功至关重要，可通过简单的信噪比参数预测；2. 发现Adam预处理器在优化中应更依赖梯度分布的均值而非方差，与传统观点相反；3. 证明了每个样本梯度信息能够实现新的分析和算法设计可能性。

Conclusion: 每个样本梯度信息为深度学习优化算法提供了新的分析和设计空间，挑战了一些传统优化方法的假设，特别是在非线性梯度处理操作方面。

Abstract: Training algorithms in deep learning usually treat a mini-batch of samples as
a single object; they average gradients over the mini-batch, and then process
the average in various ways. Computing other statistics beyond the average may
have been seen as prohibitively resource intensive in automatic differentiation
(AD) frameworks. We show that this is not the case. Generally, gradient
statistics can be implemented through a surgery of the AD graph, which, in some
cases, incur almost no computational and memory overheads compared to the
mini-batch gradient computation. Additionally, we show that in certain classes
of models, including transformers, JAX's vectorization transformation offers a
viable implementation for prototyping and experimentation. We then revise our
understanding of two nonlinear operations in optimization through the lens of
per-example gradient transformations. We first study signSGD and show that the
optimal placement of the sign operation in the gradient processing chain is
crucial to success and can be predicted with a simple signal-to-noise ratio
argument. Next we study per-example variations of the Adam preconditioner, and
show that optimization is best served when the preconditioner is dominated by
the mean rather than the variance of the gradient distribution - in contrast to
conventional wisdom. Overall we demonstrate that per-example gradient
information enables new analyses and possibilities for algorithm design.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文挑战了监督微调（SFT）无法泛化而强化学习（RL）泛化能力更强的观点，通过系统实验证明SFT在适当训练数据下可以达到与RL相当的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新审视关于SFT只是记忆训练数据而无法泛化、RL具有更强泛化能力的普遍观点，探索SFT在适当训练策略下的真实泛化潜力。

Method: 在两个决策基准（Sokoban和General Points）上进行系统评估，引入提示多样性和思维链监督来改进SFT训练，并与RL基线进行比较。

Result: 引入提示多样性打破了固定提示的伪影，思维链监督显著提高了对更困难任务的泛化能力，结合两者后SFT在指令变体和难度变体设置中都达到了与RL相当或更好的泛化性能。

Conclusion: SFT并不天生劣于RL，通过适当策划的训练数据，简单的SFT可以达到与RL相当的强泛化能力，支持数据中心的视角。

Abstract: A prevailing view holds that supervised fine-tuning (SFT) memorizes training
data and fails to generalize, whereas reinforcement learning (RL) attains
broader robustness. We revisit this claim through a systematic evaluation on
two decision-making benchmarks, Sokoban and General Points, and arrive at a
different conclusion. We show that much of SFT's perceived failure stems from
frozen-prompt artifacts: when trained on fixed instruction templates, SFT
models cling to training semantics rather than adapting to new ones.
Introducing prompt diversity during training breaks this shortcut and yields
strong generalization to unseen instruction variants without harming
in-distribution performance. Beyond instruction shifts, we ask whether SFT can
generalize to strictly harder tasks. Here, chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision
provides an algorithmic scaffold that markedly improves transfer to more
difficult regimes, such as larger Sokoban grids with additional boxes and
arithmetic with out-of-distribution values or five-card compositions that
increase combinatorial complexity. Finally, combining prompt diversity with CoT
achieves the best of both worlds: robust generalization across both
instruction-variant and difficulty-variant settings, matching or surpassing RL
baselines on our benchmarks while retaining SFT's simplicity and stability.
These findings challenge the narrative that SFT is inherently inferior to RL
and support a data-centric perspective: with appropriately curated
demonstrations, vanilla SFT can generalize as strongly as RL. Code reproducing
the results in the paper can be found at:

TL;DR: 本文研究了基于奖励的策略来自动优化变分自编码器(VAE)工作流程，使用压电力显微镜数据作为模型系统，通过高斯混合模型和贝叶斯高斯混合模型构建奖励函数来评估潜在空间表示的质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 显微镜技术产生大量复杂图像数据，需要发现更简单、可解释和简约的形式来揭示底层物理结构。VAE虽然能构建低维表示，但其性能依赖于多个设计选择，通常需要通过试错和经验分析来优化。

Method: 使用压电力显微镜数据作为模型系统，研究基于奖励的策略来评估潜在空间表示。采用高斯混合模型(GMM)和贝叶斯高斯混合模型(BGMM)来近似潜在空间，构建能够估计模型效率的奖励函数。

Result: 分析表明，使用GMM和BGMM近似潜在空间为构建奖励函数提供了坚实基础，这些函数能够估计模型效率并指导寻找最优简约表示。

Conclusion: 基于奖励的策略可以自动化且无偏地优化VAE工作流程，GMM和BGMM方法为构建有效的奖励函数提供了可靠基础，有助于发现最优的简约表示。

Abstract: Microscopy techniques generate vast amounts of complex image data that in
principle can be used to discover simpler, interpretable, and parsimonious
forms to reveal the underlying physical structures, such as elementary building
blocks in molecular systems or order parameters and phases in crystalline
materials. Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) provide a powerful means of
constructing such low-dimensional representations, but their performance
heavily depends on multiple non-myopic design choices, which are often
optimized through trial-and-error and empirical analysis. To enable automated
and unbiased optimization of VAE workflows, we investigated reward-based
strategies for evaluating latent space representations. Using Piezoresponse
Force Microscopy data as a model system, we examined multiple policies and
reward functions that can serve as a foundation for automated optimization. Our
analysis shows that approximating the latent space with Gaussian Mixture Models
(GMM) and Bayesian Gaussian Mixture Models (BGMM) provides a strong basis for
constructing reward functions capable of estimating model efficiency and
guiding the search for optimal parsimonious representations.

Motivation: 受编码计算范式启发，将其应用于机器学习，设计高效的正则化机制来鼓励更平滑的表征和更可泛化的解决方案

Method: 设计编码平滑模块，可集成到监督和无监督训练流程中，通过处理数据的线性组合来正则化学习，也可在推理时随机化模型增强对抗鲁棒性

Result: 在监督和无监督任务上的广泛实验表明，编码平滑能持续改善泛化能力，并在基于梯度的对抗攻击下达到最先进的鲁棒性

Conclusion: 编码平滑模块是有效的正则化机制，能显著提升模型泛化能力和对抗鲁棒性，且计算开销小

Abstract: We introduce the coded-smoothing module, which can be seamlessly integrated
into standard training pipelines, both supervised and unsupervised, to
regularize learning and improve generalization with minimal computational
overhead. In addition, it can be incorporated into the inference pipeline to
randomize the model and enhance robustness against adversarial perturbations.
The design of coded-smoothing is inspired by general coded computing, a
paradigm originally developed to mitigate straggler and adversarial failures in
distributed computing by processing linear combinations of the data rather than
the raw inputs. Building on this principle, we adapt coded computing to machine
learning by designing an efficient and effective regularization mechanism that
encourages smoother representations and more generalizable solutions. Extensive
experiments on both supervised and unsupervised tasks demonstrate that
coded-smoothing consistently improves generalization and achieves
state-of-the-art robustness against gradient-based adversarial attacks.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了序列模型中长度泛化问题，通过结合循环网络和Transformer的优势构建混合模型，并提出延迟注意力层训练的策略来改善长度泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 循环网络擅长状态跟踪但在关联回忆方面表现不佳，而Transformer擅长关联回忆但无法将状态跟踪能力扩展到更长的序列。研究者希望结合这两种架构的互补优势。

Method: 构建了整合循环和注意力组件的混合模型，并提出延迟注意力层训练的策略来防止Transformer组件利用捷径解决方案。

Result: 实验表明，延迟注意力层训练的方法显著改善了长度泛化性能，使混合模型在比训练序列长三倍的混合序列上达到接近完美的准确率（>90%）。

Conclusion: Transformer组件对捷径解决方案的依赖是混合模型长度泛化的主要障碍，而延迟注意力层训练是一种简单有效的缓解策略。

Abstract: We study length generalization in sequence models on a composite problem
involving both state tracking and associative recall. Prior work finds that
recurrent networks handle state tracking well but struggle with recall, whereas
Transformers excel at recall yet fail to extend state-tracking capabilities to
longer sequences. Motivated by the complementary strengths of these
architectures, we construct hybrid models integrating recurrent and
attention-based components, and train them on the combined task to evaluate
whether both capabilities can be preserved. Our results reveal that, in such
hybrids, the Transformer component tends to exploit shortcut solutions, leading
to poor length generalization. We identify this shortcut reliance as a key
obstacle and propose a simple yet effective training strategy -- delaying the
training of the attention layers -- that mitigates this effect and
significantly improves length generalization performance. Our experiments show
that this approach enables hybrid models to achieve near-perfect accuracy
($>90\%$) on hybrid sequences three times longer than those used during
training.

TL;DR: 提出基于能量的变分潜在先验(EVaLP)方法，通过将先验建模为能量模型来解决VAE中的"先验空洞"问题，同时避免传统EBM的MCMC采样效率问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决VAE生成模糊和不一致样本的问题，特别是"先验空洞"问题——先验高概率区域在后验中概率低，导致生成质量差。需要在先验灵活性和采样效率之间取得平衡。

Method: 将先验建模为能量模型(EBM)，使用变分方法处理EBM的归一化常数，避免昂贵的MCMC方法。通过采样器网络近似变分形式，采用交替优化训练先验，生成时采样器简化为隐式变分先验。

Result: 与多个SOTA基线比较显示，在图像生成质量、先验空洞减少和采样效率方面均有改进。

Conclusion: EVaLP方法有效解决了VAE的先验空洞问题，在保持先验灵活性的同时实现了高效采样，提升了生成质量。

Abstract: Variational Auto-Encoders (VAEs) are known to generate blurry and
inconsistent samples. One reason for this is the "prior hole" problem. A prior
hole refers to regions that have high probability under the VAE's prior but low
probability under the VAE's posterior. This means that during data generation,
high probability samples from the prior could have low probability under the
posterior, resulting in poor quality data. Ideally, a prior needs to be
flexible enough to match the posterior while retaining the ability to generate
samples fast. Generative models continue to address this tradeoff. This paper
proposes to model the prior as an energy-based model (EBM). While EBMs are
known to offer the flexibility to match posteriors (and also improving the
ELBO), they are traditionally slow in sample generation due to their dependency
on MCMC methods. Our key idea is to bring a variational approach to tackle the
normalization constant in EBMs, thus bypassing the expensive MCMC approaches.
The variational form can be approximated with a sampler network, and we show
that such an approach to training priors can be formulated as an alternating
optimization problem. Moreover, the same sampler reduces to an implicit
variational prior during generation, providing efficient and fast sampling. We
compare our Energy-based Variational Latent Prior (EVaLP) method to multiple
SOTA baselines and show improvements in image generation quality, reduced prior
holes, and better sampling efficiency.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SLogic提出了一种基于子图的逻辑规则学习方法，为逻辑规则分配查询相关的动态置信度分数，而不是固定的全局置信度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有逻辑规则方法通常将规则视为通用的，为每个规则分配固定的置信度分数，忽略了查询特定的上下文。这是一个重要限制，因为规则的重要性会因查询而异。

Method: SLogic框架通过使用以查询头实体为中心的子图来评估每个规则的动态重要性，核心是一个利用局部子图上下文的评分函数。

Result: 在基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，通过利用局部子图上下文，SLogic在知识图谱补全任务中持续优于最先进的基线方法，包括基于嵌入和基于规则的方法。

Conclusion: SLogic通过引入查询相关的规则评分机制，显著提升了逻辑规则方法在知识图谱补全中的性能，证明了考虑局部上下文对于规则重要性评估的重要性。

Abstract: Logical rule-based methods offer an interpretable approach to knowledge graph
completion by capturing compositional relationships in the form of
human-readable inference rules. However, current approaches typically treat
logical rules as universal, assigning each rule a fixed confidence score that
ignores query-specific context. This is a significant limitation, as a rule's
importance can vary depending on the query. To address this, we introduce
SLogic (Subgraph-Informed Logical Rule learning), a novel framework that
assigns query-dependent scores to logical rules. The core of SLogic is a
scoring function that utilizes the subgraph centered on a query's head entity,
allowing the significance of each rule to be assessed dynamically. Extensive
experiments on benchmark datasets show that by leveraging local subgraph
context, SLogic consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, including
both embedding-based and rule-based methods.

Motivation: 扩散大语言模型虽然具有双向注意力机制的优势，但在推理效率上不如自回归模型，且现有并行解码方法会带来性能下降。

Method: 采用并行解码的候选生成和验证流水线，确保生成序列与静态采样相同，无需额外模型前向调用。

Result: 在数学推理任务上，DLLMs的吞吐量提升至2.8倍，且无性能损失。

Conclusion: Freedave算法成功解决了DLLMs推理效率低的问题，实现了无损的并行解码加速。

Abstract: Diffusion Large Language Models (DLLMs) have emerged as a new paradigm of
language modeling beyond autoregressive next-token prediction. Thanks to their
bidirectional attention mechanism, DLLMs are more capable of capturing the
connection of context, and thus show unique advantages in challenges like the
famous "reversal curse" or learning under data-constrained scenarios. However,
this bidirectional nature also brings an obstacle that DLLMs are not inherently
compatible with KV Cache, and consequently, the inference efficiency is not
competitive compared with autoregressive models. Taking advantage of their
inherent capability of multi-token prediction, existing parallel decoding
algorithms can speed up the DLLM inference, but at the cost of non-negligible
performance degradation. To overcome this challenge, we introduce Free
Draft-and-Verification (Freedave), a novel fast sampling algorithm tailored for
DLLMs that achieves lossless parallel decoding. Specifically, we propose a
pipeline of parallel-decoded candidate generation and verification, which is
guaranteed to reproduce the same sequence generated by static sampling, without
introducing extra model forward calls. By applying Freedave, the throughput of
DLLMs can be boosted up to $2.8\times$ without performance degradation on math
reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Detecting hallucinations in Large Language Model-generated text is crucial
for their safe deployment. While probing classifiers show promise, they operate
on isolated layer-token pairs and are LLM-specific, limiting their
effectiveness and hindering cross-LLM applications. In this paper, we introduce
a novel approach to address these shortcomings. We build on the natural
sequential structure of activation data in both axes (layers $\times$ tokens)
and advocate treating full activation tensors akin to images. We design
ACT-ViT, a Vision Transformer-inspired model that can be effectively and
efficiently applied to activation tensors and supports training on data from
multiple LLMs simultaneously. Through comprehensive experiments encompassing
diverse LLMs and datasets, we demonstrate that ACT-ViT consistently outperforms
traditional probing techniques while remaining extremely efficient for
deployment. In particular, we show that our architecture benefits substantially
from multi-LLM training, achieves strong zero-shot performance on unseen
datasets, and can be transferred effectively to new LLMs through fine-tuning.

TL;DR: 该论文从第一性原理角度研究了梯度学习中的塑性损失现象，揭示了激活饱和和表示冗余导致参数空间稳定流形陷阱的机制，发现静态泛化属性与持续学习中的塑性损失存在根本性冲突。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型在非平稳环境中会出现塑性损失现象，即模型未来学习能力下降的问题，这阻碍了模型在持续学习场景中的应用。

Method: 基于动力系统理论，通过识别参数空间中的稳定流形来形式化定义塑性损失，分析激活饱和导致的冻结单元和表示冗余导致的克隆单元流形两种主要机制。

Result: 理论分析揭示了低秩表示和简单性偏置等静态泛化属性与持续学习中的塑性损失存在根本性冲突，并通过数值模拟验证了这一发现。

Conclusion: 研究为理解塑性损失提供了理论基础，并探索了架构选择或针对性扰动作为潜在的缓解策略，为设计更适应非平稳环境的深度学习模型提供了方向。

Abstract: Deep learning models excel in stationary data but struggle in non-stationary
environments due to a phenomenon known as loss of plasticity (LoP), the
degradation of their ability to learn in the future. This work presents a
first-principles investigation of LoP in gradient-based learning. Grounded in
dynamical systems theory, we formally define LoP by identifying stable
manifolds in the parameter space that trap gradient trajectories. Our analysis
reveals two primary mechanisms that create these traps: frozen units from
activation saturation and cloned-unit manifolds from representational
redundancy. Our framework uncovers a fundamental tension: properties that
promote generalization in static settings, such as low-rank representations and
simplicity biases, directly contribute to LoP in continual learning scenarios.
We validate our theoretical analysis with numerical simulations and explore
architectural choices or targeted perturbations as potential mitigation
strategies.

*Zhongxuan Liu,Yue Kang,Thomas C. M. Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了具有随机延迟反馈的Lipschitz赌博机问题，针对有界和无界延迟分别提出了算法，在有界延迟下达到接近无延迟最优性能，在无界延迟下达到近乎最优的遗憾界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的Lipschitz赌博机问题假设奖励能够立即观察到，但在实际应用中（如在线广告、推荐系统）奖励反馈往往存在随机延迟，这需要新的算法设计。

Method: 对于有界延迟，提出了延迟感知的缩放算法；对于无界延迟，设计了基于阶段学习的新策略，在精心调度的间隔内积累可靠反馈。

Result: 有界延迟下的算法在无延迟最优性能基础上仅增加与最大延迟相关的项；无界延迟下的方法达到近乎最优的遗憾界（至多差对数因子）。实验验证了算法在各种延迟场景下的有效性。

Conclusion: 本文成功解决了延迟反馈下的Lipschitz赌博机问题，为实际应用中的延迟场景提供了理论保证和实用算法。

Abstract: The Lipschitz bandit problem extends stochastic bandits to a continuous
action set defined over a metric space, where the expected reward function
satisfies a Lipschitz condition. In this work, we introduce a new problem of
Lipschitz bandit in the presence of stochastic delayed feedback, where the
rewards are not observed immediately but after a random delay. We consider both
bounded and unbounded stochastic delays, and design algorithms that attain
sublinear regret guarantees in each setting. For bounded delays, we propose a
delay-aware zooming algorithm that retains the optimal performance of the
delay-free setting up to an additional term that scales with the maximal delay
$\tau_{\max}$. For unbounded delays, we propose a novel phased learning
strategy that accumulates reliable feedback over carefully scheduled intervals,
and establish a regret lower bound showing that our method is nearly optimal up
to logarithmic factors. Finally, we present experimental results to demonstrate
the efficiency of our algorithms under various delay scenarios.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文首次对联邦推理的鲁棒性进行系统性分析，提出了针对线性平均聚合器的理论分析框架，并将非线性聚合器的鲁棒性问题转化为对抗性机器学习问题，开发了结合对抗训练和测试时鲁棒聚合的新方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦推理作为一种结合多个模型预测的解决方案，虽然能保持模型的本地性和专有性，但其鲁棒性研究被严重忽视，容易受到简单攻击的影响。

Method: 对基于平均的聚合器进行理论分析；将非线性聚合器的鲁棒性问题转化为对抗性机器学习问题；提出结合对抗训练和测试时鲁棒聚合的DeepSet聚合模型。

Result: 新方法在多个基准测试中显著优于现有鲁棒聚合方法，准确率提升了4.7-22.2个百分点。

Conclusion: 联邦推理的鲁棒性是一个关键但被忽视的问题，本文提出的理论分析和鲁棒聚合方法为这一领域提供了重要贡献。

Abstract: Federated inference, in the form of one-shot federated learning, edge
ensembles, or federated ensembles, has emerged as an attractive solution to
combine predictions from multiple models. This paradigm enables each model to
remain local and proprietary while a central server queries them and aggregates
predictions. Yet, the robustness of federated inference has been largely
neglected, leaving them vulnerable to even simple attacks. To address this
critical gap, we formalize the problem of robust federated inference and
provide the first robustness analysis of this class of methods. Our analysis of
averaging-based aggregators shows that the error of the aggregator is small
either when the dissimilarity between honest responses is small or the margin
between the two most probable classes is large. Moving beyond linear averaging,
we show that problem of robust federated inference with non-linear aggregators
can be cast as an adversarial machine learning problem. We then introduce an
advanced technique using the DeepSet aggregation model, proposing a novel
composition of adversarial training and test-time robust aggregation to
robustify non-linear aggregators. Our composition yields significant
improvements, surpassing existing robust aggregation methods by 4.7 - 22.2% in
accuracy points across diverse benchmarks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DiSC-AMC是一种高效的自调制分类方法，通过离散化统计特征、精简示例列表和优化提示模板，在减少50%以上计算资源的同时保持竞争性准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于LLM的自动调制分类方法在实际部署中面临的长提示上下文和大模型规模问题，降低推理成本并实现实际应用。

Method: 采用离散化高阶统计量、轻量级预筛选器过滤示例、基于理性分析的特征选择，以及校准的仅标签预测提示模板。

Result: 在10种调制类型的合成AMC任务中，使用约5B参数的Gemini-2.5-Flash模型达到45.5%准确率，相比7B参数的基线模型（5.2%）显著提升，同时减少超过50%的计算资源。

Conclusion: 精心设计的离散化和上下文选择策略可以在大幅降低推理成本的同时，保持基于提示的AMC方法的优势，实现实际应用部署。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can perform Automatic Modulation Classification
(AMC) in an open-set manner without LLM fine-tuning when equipped with
carefully designed in-context prompts~\cite{rostami2025plug}. Building on this
prior work, we target the practical bottlenecks of long prompt contexts and
large model sizes that impede in-the-loop deployment. We present Discretized
Statistics in-Context Automatic Modulation Classification (DiSC-AMC), a token-
and parameter-efficient variant that: (i) discretizes higher-order statistics
and cumulants into compact symbolic tokens, (ii) prunes the exemplar list via a
lightweight k-top neural prefilter and filters misleading/low-impact features
using rationales extracted from prior LLM responses, and (iii) enforces
label-only predictions through a calibrated prompt template. Together, these
changes reduce both input/output tokens and the model parameter footprint by
more than half while maintaining competitive accuracy. On synthetic AMC with
ten modulation types under noise, a 7B \textit{DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen}
baseline achieves 5.2% accuracy, whereas our system, using an approximately
5B-parameter \textit{Gemini-2.5-Flash}~\cite{comanici2025gemini} model, attains
45.5% accuracy. These results demonstrate that careful discretization and
context selection can cut inference cost by over 2x while preserving the
advantages of prompt-based AMC and enabling practical in-the-loop use.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DecepChain是一种新型后门攻击方法，通过诱导LLMs生成看似合理但最终得出错误结论的推理链，利用模型自身幻觉并强化错误推理过程，具有高度隐蔽性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示LLMs推理能力中一个紧迫但未被充分探索的风险：攻击者可以诱导模型生成表面合理但实际错误的推理链，这种隐蔽的失败模式可能悄悄破坏LLM答案并削弱人类对LLM推理的信任。

Method: 利用LLMs自身幻觉，通过微调模型自然生成的错误推理样本，然后使用Group Relative Policy Optimization（GRPO）和翻转奖励机制来强化错误推理，同时加入合理性正则化器保持推理的流畅性和表面合理性。

Result: 在多个基准测试和模型上，DecepChain实现了高攻击成功率，同时在良性场景下性能下降最小。人类评估显示人类评分者难以区分被操纵的推理过程和良性推理过程。

Conclusion: 这种隐蔽的失败模式可能悄悄破坏LLM答案并削弱人类对LLM推理的信任，强调了未来研究应对这一警示性风险的紧迫性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been demonstrating increasingly strong
reasoning capability with their chain-of-thoughts (CoT), which are routinely
used by humans to judge answer quality. This reliance creates a powerful yet
fragile basis for trust. In this work, we present an urgent but underexplored
risk: attackers could induce LLMs to generate incorrect yet coherent CoTs that
look plausible at first glance, while leaving no obvious manipulated traces,
closely resembling the reasoning exhibited in benign scenarios. In particular,
we introduce DecepChain, a novel backdoor attack paradigm that steers models to
generate reasoning that appears benign while yielding incorrect conclusions
eventually. At a high level, DecepChain exploits LLMs' own hallucination and
amplifies it by fine-tuning on naturally erroneous rollouts generated by the
model itself and then reinforces it via Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) with a flipped reward on triggered inputs, plus a plausibility
regularizer to preserve fluent, benign-looking reasoning. Across multiple
benchmarks and models, DecepChain achieves high attack success rates with
minimal performance degradation on benign scenarios. Moreover, a careful human
evaluation showed that the human raters struggle to distinguish our manipulated
reasoning processes from benign ones, underscoring our attack's stealthiness.
Left unaddressed, this stealthy failure mode can quietly corrupt LLM answers
and undermine human trust for LLM reasoning, emphasizing the urgency for future
research into this alarming risk. Project page: https://decepchain.github.io/.

Abstract: The exponential growth of internet generated data has fueled advancements in
artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) for
extracting actionable insights in marketing,telecom, and health sectors. This
chapter explores ML applications across three domains namely healthcare,
marketing, and telecommunications, with a primary focus on developing a
framework for optimal ML algorithm selection. In healthcare, the framework
addresses critical challenges such as cardiovascular disease prediction
accounting for 28.1% of global deaths and fetal health classification into
healthy or unhealthy states, utilizing three datasets. ML algorithms are
categorized into eager, lazy, and hybrid learners, selected based on dataset
attributes, performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall), and Akaike
Information Criterion (AIC) scores. For validation, eight datasets from the
three sectors are employed in the experiments. The key contribution is a
recommendation framework that identifies the best ML model according to input
attributes, balancing performance evaluation and model complexity to enhance
efficiency and accuracy in diverse real-world applications. This approach
bridges gaps in automated model selection, offering practical implications for
interdisciplinary ML deployment.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种无需跳跃连接就能稳定高效训练Transformer的方法，通过分析skipless transformer的Jacobian矩阵，揭示了跳跃连接改善条件数的机制，并通过初始化策略恢复其稳定效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer的成功通常归功于其可扩展性，但无跳跃连接的训练一直很困难。跳跃连接虽然稳定优化，但破坏了表示的层次结构，因此需要探索能否高效训练无跳跃连接的Transformer。

Method: 分析skipless transformer块的Jacobian矩阵，理解跳跃连接改善条件数的机制，设计一个原则性的初始化策略来恢复跳跃连接的稳定效果，而不改变标准架构。

Result: 在监督和自监督设置下验证Vision Transformers，skipless ViTs克服了常规优化障碍，学习了更丰富的层次表示，在密集预测基准上优于包含跳跃连接的强基线模型。

Conclusion: 跳跃连接不是训练ViT的基本要求，这为视觉模型中的层次表示学习开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Transformers have achieved remarkable success across a wide range of
applications, a feat often attributed to their scalability. Yet training them
without skip (residual) connections remains notoriously difficult. While skips
stabilize optimization, they also disrupt the hierarchical structure of
representations, raising the long-standing question of whether transformers can
be trained efficiently without them. In this work, we address this problem by
analyzing the Jacobian of a skipless transformer block, showing why skips
improve conditioning and revealing that their stabilization benefits can be
recovered through a principled initialization strategy. Building on this
insight, we introduce the first method that enables stable and efficient
training of skipless transformers without altering the standard architecture.
We validate our approach on Vision Transformers (ViTs) in both supervised and
self-supervised settings, demonstrating that skipless ViTs trained with our
initialization overcome the usual optimization barriers, learn richer
hierarchical representations, and outperform strong baselines, that incorporate
skip connections, on dense prediction benchmarks. These results show that skip
connections are not a fundamental requirement for training ViTs and open new
avenues for hierarchical representation learning in vision models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Prediction-Powered Transformer (PPT)框架，通过上下文好奇心正则化来增强决策预训练变换器的分布外泛化能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有决策预训练变换器(DPTs)在超出预训练数据分布时泛化能力不足，需要解决这一局限性

Method: 引入上下文好奇心作为轻量级正则化器，通过辅助奖励预测器使用预测误差作为内在好奇心信号，在训练中鼓励更广泛的探索

Result: 在高斯多臂赌博机概念验证实验中，PPT显示出更好的鲁棒性，当测试环境奖励方差较高且预训练数据多样性有限时，能缓解DPT的性能下降

Conclusion: 虽然离线数据质量仍然至关重要，但好奇心驱动的预训练为增强上下文强化学习智能体的分布外泛化能力提供了有前景的方向

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to grow in capability, there is
increasing interest in incorporating them into decision-making tasks. A common
pipeline for this is Decision-Pretrained Transformers (DPTs). However, existing
training methods for DPTs often struggle to generalize beyond their pretraining
data distribution. To explore mitigation of this limitation, we propose
in-context curiosity -- a lightweight, exploration-inspired regularizer for
offline pretraining -- and introduce the Prediction-Powered Transformer (PPT)
framework. PPT augments DPT with an auxiliary reward predictor, using
prediction error as an intrinsic curiosity signal to encourage broader
exploration during training. In proof-of-concept experiments on Gaussian
multi-armed bandits, PPT shows improved robustness: it moderates the
performance degradation observed in DPT when test environments exhibit higher
variance in reward, particularly when pretraining data has limited diversity.
While the quality of offline data remain fundamental, our preliminary results
suggest that curiosity-driven pretraining offers a promising direction for
enhancing out-of-distribution generalization in in-context RL agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于CMDPs缺乏对所有初始状态分布都最优的通用策略，当初始分布变化时需要重新求解CMDP，这增加了问题复杂度。

Method: 使用CMDPs的对偶分析和线性规划的扰动分析来推导最优值随初始分布变化的界限。

Result: 推导出了CMDPs最优值随不同初始分布变化的界限，并展示了如何用这些界限分析策略遗憾。

Conclusion: 该研究为理解CMDPs最优值对初始分布的敏感性提供了理论框架，并为处理初始分布未知变化的情况提供了分析工具。

Abstract: Constrained Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs) are notably more complex to
solve than standard MDPs due to the absence of universally optimal policies
across all initial state distributions. This necessitates re-solving the CMDP
whenever the initial distribution changes. In this work, we analyze how the
optimal value of CMDPs varies with different initial distributions, deriving
bounds on these variations using duality analysis of CMDPs and perturbation
analysis in linear programming. Moreover, we show how such bounds can be used
to analyze the regret of a given policy due to unknown variations of the
initial distribution.

TL;DR: Kanzi是一个基于流的蛋白质结构标记器，使用扩散自编码器和流匹配损失来简化蛋白质结构标记化过程，在更小的模型规模和训练成本下实现更好的重建性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前蛋白质结构标记方法依赖定制组件，虽然具有空间对称性不变性，但难以优化和扩展。需要更简单高效的标记化方法。

Method: 提出Kanzi流标记器，使用扩散自编码器和流匹配损失，用全局坐标替代基于框架的表示，用标准注意力替代SE(3)不变注意力。

Result: 该方法稳定训练参数高效模型，在重建指标上优于现有标记器，模型规模和训练成本大幅降低。自回归模型在生成性能上优于基于标记的类似模型。

Conclusion: Kanzi简化了蛋白质结构标记器的多个方面，提供了一种更稳定高效的蛋白质结构标记化方法，尽管在生成性能上尚未达到最先进的连续扩散模型水平。

Abstract: Protein structure tokenizers enable the creation of multimodal models of
protein structure, sequence, and function. Current approaches to protein
structure tokenization rely on bespoke components that are invariant to spatial
symmetries, but that are challenging to optimize and scale. We present Kanzi, a
flow-based tokenizer for tokenization and generation of protein structures.
Kanzi consists of a diffusion autoencoder trained with a flow matching loss. We
show that this approach simplifies several aspects of protein structure
tokenizers: frame-based representations can be replaced with global
coordinates, complex losses are replaced with a single flow matching loss, and
SE(3)-invariant attention operations can be replaced with standard attention.
We find that these changes stabilize the training of parameter-efficient models
that outperform existing tokenizers on reconstruction metrics at a fraction of
the model size and training cost. An autoregressive model trained with Kanzi
outperforms similar generative models that operate over tokens, although it
does not yet match the performance of state-of-the-art continuous diffusion
models. Code is available here: https://github.com/rdilip/kanzi/.

TL;DR: AReUReDi是一种离散优化算法，通过结合Tchebycheff标量化、局部平衡提议和退火Metropolis-Hastings更新，保证收敛到帕累托前沿，用于多目标生物分子序列设计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在治疗和生物分子工程中，设计满足多个冲突目标的序列是一个核心挑战。现有生成框架主要在连续空间中运行，缺乏对多目标帕累托最优性的保证。

Method: 基于Rectified Discrete Flows (ReDi)，结合Tchebycheff标量化、局部平衡提议和退火Metropolis-Hastings更新，偏置采样朝向帕累托最优状态，同时保持分布不变性。

Result: 应用于肽和SMILES序列设计，AReUReDi同时优化多达五个治疗特性（包括亲和力、溶解度、溶血性、半衰期和非污染性），并优于进化和基于扩散的基线方法。

Conclusion: AReUReDi为多属性生物分子生成建立了一个强大的序列基础框架。

Abstract: Designing sequences that satisfy multiple, often conflicting, objectives is a
central challenge in therapeutic and biomolecular engineering. Existing
generative frameworks largely operate in continuous spaces with
single-objective guidance, while discrete approaches lack guarantees for
multi-objective Pareto optimality. We introduce AReUReDi (Annealed Rectified
Updates for Refining Discrete Flows), a discrete optimization algorithm with
theoretical guarantees of convergence to the Pareto front. Building on
Rectified Discrete Flows (ReDi), AReUReDi combines Tchebycheff scalarization,
locally balanced proposals, and annealed Metropolis-Hastings updates to bias
sampling toward Pareto-optimal states while preserving distributional
invariance. Applied to peptide and SMILES sequence design, AReUReDi
simultaneously optimizes up to five therapeutic properties (including affinity,
solubility, hemolysis, half-life, and non-fouling) and outperforms both
evolutionary and diffusion-based baselines. These results establish AReUReDi as
a powerful, sequence-based framework for multi-property biomolecule generation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种仅使用查询的注意力机制，在持续学习场景中有效缓解了塑性损失和灾难性遗忘问题，并建立了与元学习的理论联系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 持续学习面临数据分布漂移的挑战，传统transformer架构在持续学习场景中容易出现塑性损失和灾难性遗忘问题。

Method: 采用仅查询的注意力机制，丢弃键和值，但保留transformer架构的核心归纳偏置，并与模型无关元学习建立概念联系。

Result: 在持续学习场景中，简化后的注意力机制显著优于选择性重新初始化等基线方法，且保持较高曲率秩的模型更易保持塑性。

Conclusion: 完整注意力对于在持续学习中捕获元学习优势可能不是必需的，仅查询注意力机制提供了有效的替代方案。

Abstract: Continual learning involves learning from a stream of data without repetition
of data points, a scenario that is inherently complex due to distributional
shift across tasks. We propose a query-only attention mechanism that discards
keys and values, yet preserves the core inductive bias of transformer
architectures. In continual learning scenarios, this simplified mechanism
significantly mitigates both loss of plasticity and catastrophic forgetting,
outperforming baselines such as selective re-initialization. We establish a
conceptual link between query-only attention, full transformer attention, and
model agnostic meta-learning, framing them as instances of meta-learning. We
further provide intuition for why query-based models and attention networks
help preserve plasticity in continual settings. Finally, through preliminary
Hessian spectrum analysis, we observe that models maintaining higher curvature
rank across tasks tend to retain plasticity. Our findings suggest that full
attention may not be essential for capturing the benefits of meta-learning in
continual learning.

Abstract: Large Language models (LLMs) have shown promise as generators of symbolic
control policies, producing interpretable program-like representations through
iterative search. However, these models are not capable of separating the
functional structure of a policy from the numerical values it is parametrized
by, thus making the search process slow and inefficient. We propose a hybrid
approach that decouples structural synthesis from parameter optimization by
introducing an additional optimization layer for local parameter search. In our
method, the numerical parameters of LLM-generated programs are extracted and
optimized numerically to maximize task performance. With this integration, an
LLM iterates over the functional structure of programs, while a separate
optimization loop is used to find a locally optimal set of parameters
accompanying candidate programs. We evaluate our method on a set of control
tasks, showing that it achieves higher returns and improved sample efficiency
compared to purely LLM-guided search. We show that combining symbolic program
synthesis with numerical optimization yields interpretable yet high-performing
policies, bridging the gap between language-model-guided design and classical
control tuning. Our code is available at

Abstract: We present GDLNN, a new graph machine learning architecture, for graph
classification tasks. GDLNN combines a domain-specific programming language,
called GDL, with neural networks. The main strength of GDLNN lies in its GDL
layer, which generates expressive and interpretable graph representations.
Since the graph representation is interpretable, existing model explanation
techniques can be directly applied to explain GDLNN's predictions. Our
evaluation shows that the GDL-based representation achieves high accuracy on
most graph classification benchmark datasets, outperforming dominant graph
learning methods such as GNNs. Applying an existing model explanation technique
also yields high-quality explanations of GDLNN's predictions. Furthermore, the
cost of GDLNN is low when the explanation cost is included.

TL;DR: 提出了一种贝叶斯双轴主动分类方法，用于工作记忆重建任务，通过控制空间负载和特征绑定负载两个变量，使用高斯过程概率分类器指导刺激获取，相比传统自适应阶梯方法能更快收敛并揭示个体差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统认知实验通常只控制单一因素并用标量总结性能，需要开发能同时控制多个变量并输出完整性能曲面的方法。

Method: 使用贝叶斯双轴主动分类方法，在沉浸式虚拟测试环境中进行5x5工作记忆重建任务，控制空间负载L和特征绑定负载K两个变量，通过高斯过程概率分类器指导刺激获取。

Result: 与传统自适应阶梯方法相比，新方法在年轻成人群体中达到同等效果（组内相关系数0.755），能更快收敛（仅需约30个样本），并能揭示空间负载与特征绑定之间的个体差异。

Conclusion: 该方法为认知实验提供了更高效的多变量自适应设计，能够快速准确地估计完整性能模型并揭示个体差异。

Abstract: While adaptive experimental design has outgrown one-dimensional,
staircase-based adaptations, most cognitive experiments still control a single
factor and summarize performance with a scalar. We show a validation of a
Bayesian, two-axis, active-classification approach, carried out in an immersive
virtual testing environment for a 5-by-5 working-memory reconstruction task.
Two variables are controlled: spatial load L (number of occupied tiles) and
feature-binding load K (number of distinct colors) of items. Stimulus
acquisition is guided by posterior uncertainty of a nonparametric Gaussian
Process (GP) probabilistic classifier, which outputs a surface over (L, K)
rather than a single threshold or max span value. In a young adult population,
we compare GP-driven Adaptive Mode (AM) with a traditional adaptive staircase
Classic Mode (CM), which varies L only at K = 3. Parity between the methods is
achieved for this cohort, with an intraclass coefficient of 0.755 at K = 3.
Additionally, AM reveals individual differences in interactions between spatial
load and feature binding. AM estimates converge more quickly than other
sampling strategies, demonstrating that only about 30 samples are required for
accurate fitting of the full model.

TL;DR: Composer是一个模块化混合模型架构搜索框架，通过小规模探索和扩展策略发现优于Llama 3.2的新混合LLM架构，在350M-3B参数规模上提升下游任务准确率并改善训练推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有混合模型架构设计主要依赖人工探索，但由于设计空间巨大和训练成本高昂，难以发现适合预训练的关键计算原语组合。

Method: 提出Composer框架：在小规模探索模型架构，使用提出的扩展策略将表现最佳的架构扩展到更大规模。

Result: 发现的新混合LLM架构在350M-3B参数规模上验证损失持续降低，下游任务准确率提升1.1-3.1%（最高8.3%），同时提升训练和推理效率。

Conclusion: Composer框架能够有效发现高性能混合模型架构，超越现有Transformer模型，为模型架构设计提供了系统化方法。

Abstract: Hybrid model architectures that combine computational primitives (e.g.,
Attention, MLP) in different ratios have shown promising performance beyond
Transformers. Some studies have shown that different interleavings of
primitives can affect model quality as well. However, prior works explore the
hybrid model architecture design space manually. Due to the large design space
and training costs, discovering hybrid models that combine key computational
primitives for pre-training is challenging. In this work, we take a principled
approach in designing a modular hybrid model architecture search framework --
Composer. Composer explores model architectures at a small scale and
extrapolates the top-performing model architectures to a larger scale using our
proposed scaling strategies. Using Composer, we discover new hybrid LLM
architectures that outperform Llama 3.2. Compared to Llama 3.2 and previous
state-of-the-art baselines, the new model architectures consistently reduce
validation loss at parameter scales of 350M-3B and improve evaluation accuracy
on the downstream tasks by up to 2.8-8.3% (1.1-3.1% on average) while improving
both training and inference efficiency.

Conclusion: 该方法为概率张量网络学习提供了一种高效稳定的解决方案，显著提升了模型的可扩展性和性能。

Abstract: Tensor networks (TNs) enable compact representations of large tensors through
shared parameters. Their use in probabilistic modeling is particularly
appealing, as probabilistic tensor networks (PTNs) allow for tractable
computation of marginals. However, existing approaches for learning parameters
of PTNs are either computationally demanding and not fully compatible with
automatic differentiation frameworks, or numerically unstable. In this work, we
propose a conceptually simple approach for learning PTNs efficiently, that is
numerically stable. We show our method provides significant improvements in
time and space complexity, achieving 10x reduction in latency for generative
modeling on the MNIST dataset. Furthermore, our approach enables learning of
distributions with 10x more variables than previous approaches when applied to
a variety of density estimation benchmarks. Our code is publicly available at

Motivation: 需要从噪声、不规则采样的轨迹中学习物理一致的连续时间动力学，同时获得哈密顿量的不确定性估计。

Method: 在哈密顿量表面上放置高斯过程先验，将变步长多步积分器约束编码为有限线性泛函，实现向量场和哈密顿量表面的闭式条件化，无需潜在状态。

Result: 在质量-弹簧、Van der Pol和Duffing基准测试中展示了改进的向量场恢复和良好校准的哈密顿量不确定性。

Conclusion: MS-PHS GP能够学习物理一致的动力学，同时提供哈密顿量的不确定性估计，并通过设计强制能量平衡和被动性。

Abstract: We propose the multistep port-Hamiltonian Gaussian process (MS-PHS GP) to
learn physically consistent continuous-time dynamics and a posterior over the
Hamiltonian from noisy, irregularly-sampled trajectories. By placing a GP prior
on the Hamiltonian surface $H$ and encoding variable-step multistep integrator
constraints as finite linear functionals, MS-PHS GP enables closed-form
conditioning of both the vector field and the Hamiltonian surface without
latent states, while enforcing energy balance and passivity by design. We state
a finite-sample vector-field bound that separates the estimation and
variable-step discretization terms. Lastly, we demonstrate improved
vector-field recovery and well-calibrated Hamiltonian uncertainty on
mass-spring, Van der Pol, and Duffing benchmarks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的数据选择方法，通过反转训练集和验证集的角色，选择在验证集微调后预测变化最大的训练样本来提高目标分布上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据选择方法将目标样本作为验证集，通过逐个添加或移除训练样本来评估效果，这种方法计算成本高且效率低。

Method: 反转训练和验证的角色：在验证集上微调前后对训练池进行推理，选择预测变化最大的样本。

Result: 在指令调优和命名实体识别任务上的实验表明，该方法在大多数情况下比现有方法获得更低的测试对数损失。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种更简单、更快速的数据选择策略，能够有效识别对目标分布最有用的训练样本。

Abstract: State-of-the-art machine learning often follows a two-stage process:
$(i)$~pre-training on large, general-purpose datasets; $(ii)$~fine-tuning on
task-specific data. In fine-tuning, selecting training examples that closely
reflect the target distribution is crucial. However, it is often the case that
only a few samples are available from the target distribution. Existing data
selection methods treat these target samples as a validation set and estimate
the effect of adding or removing a single sample from the training pool by
performing inference on the validation set.
  We propose a simpler and faster alternative that inverts the usual role of
train and validation: we perform inference on the training pool before and
after fine-tuning on the validation set. We then select samples whose
predictions change the most. Our key insight is that the training samples most
affected by fine-tuning on a small validation set tend to be the most
beneficial for reducing test loss on the target distribution. Experiments on
instruction tuning and named entity recognition tasks show that, in most cases,
our method achieves lower test log-loss than state-of-the-art approaches. We
support our findings with theoretical analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经网络方法在图相似度计算中存在计算代价高或未能有效利用图结构信息的问题，需要一种能同时高效近似MCS和GED的方法。

Method: 将节点表示为嵌入空间中的封闭区域，捕捉节点特征和邻接模式，通过区域形状反映图结构，体积反映图大小，用区域重叠近似MCS，用不相交部分近似GED。

Result: 在MCS相似度学习中获得60.0%的相对精度提升，同时高效计算MCS和GED，在训练和推理中保持效率。

Conclusion: Graph2Region提供了一种几何嵌入方法，能同时计算MCS和GED相似度，为图相似性评估提供全面解决方案，性能优于现有方法。

Abstract: Graph similarity is critical in graph-related tasks such as graph retrieval,
where metrics like maximum common subgraph (MCS) and graph edit distance (GED)
are commonly used. However, exact computations of these metrics are known to be
NP-Hard. Recent neural network-based approaches approximate the similarity
score in embedding spaces to alleviate the computational burden, but they
either involve expensive pairwise node comparisons or fail to effectively
utilize structural and scale information of graphs. To tackle these issues, we
propose a novel geometric-based graph embedding method called Graph2Region
(G2R). G2R represents nodes as closed regions and recovers their adjacency
patterns within graphs in the embedding space. By incorporating the node
features and adjacency patterns of graphs, G2R summarizes graph regions, i.e.,
graph embeddings, where the shape captures the underlying graph structures and
the volume reflects the graph size. Consequently, the overlap between graph
regions can serve as an approximation of MCS, signifying similar node regions
and adjacency patterns. We further analyze the relationship between MCS and GED
and propose using disjoint parts as a proxy for GED similarity. This analysis
enables concurrent computation of MCS and GED, incorporating local and global
structural information. Experimental evaluation highlights G2R's competitive
performance in graph similarity computation. It achieves up to a 60.0\%
relative accuracy improvement over state-of-the-art methods in MCS similarity
learning, while maintaining efficiency in both training and inference.
Moreover, G2R showcases remarkable capability in predicting both MCS and GED
similarities simultaneously, providing a holistic assessment of graph
similarity. Code available at https://github.com/liuzhouyang/Graph2Region.

*Hongkang Li,Songtao Lu,Xiaodong Cui,Pin-Yu Chen,Meng Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文首次对单层Mamba模型的训练动态和上下文学习泛化能力进行了理论分析，发现Mamba通过线性注意力层选择信息性上下文示例，并通过非线性门控层抑制异常值影响，相比线性Transformer具有更强的抗异常值能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mamba模型在计算效率上优于Transformer模型，并在多种语言任务中表现相当，具有上下文学习能力。但由于其门控机制引入的非线性，理论理解仍然有限。本文旨在填补这一空白，分析Mamba的训练动态和上下文学习泛化能力。

Method: 分析单层Mamba模型（包含线性注意力组件和非线性门控层）的训练动态，研究其在未见过的二元分类任务上的上下文学习泛化能力，特别是在提示包含加性异常值的情况下。与线性Transformer在相同设置下进行比较分析。

Result: Mamba利用线性注意力层选择信息性上下文示例，使用非线性门控层抑制异常值影响。虽然Mamba可能需要更多训练迭代才能收敛，但在异常值比例超过线性Transformer容忍阈值时仍能保持准确预测。理论发现得到了实证实验的支持。

Conclusion: Mamba模型通过其独特的架构设计，在上下文学习中展现出对异常值的鲁棒性，这为理解其优于Transformer的潜力提供了理论依据，特别是在处理包含噪声数据的情况下。

Abstract: The Mamba model has gained significant attention for its computational
advantages over Transformer-based models, while achieving comparable
performance across a wide range of language tasks. Like Transformers, Mamba
exhibits in-context learning (ICL) capabilities, i.e., making predictions for
new tasks based on a prompt containing input-label pairs and a query, without
requiring fine-tuning. Despite its empirical success, the theoretical
understanding of Mamba remains limited, largely due to the nonlinearity
introduced by its gating mechanism. To the best of our knowledge, this paper
presents the first theoretical analysis of the training dynamics of a one-layer
Mamba model, which consists of a linear attention component followed by a
nonlinear gating layer, and its ICL generalization on unseen binary
classification tasks, even when the prompt includes additive outliers. Our
analysis shows that Mamba leverages the linear attention layer to select
informative context examples and uses the nonlinear gating layer to suppress
the influence of outliers. By establishing and comparing to the analysis of
linear Transformers under the same setting, we show that although Mamba may
require more training iterations to converge, it maintains accurate predictions
even when the proportion of outliers exceeds the threshold that a linear
Transformer can tolerate. These theoretical findings are supported by empirical
experiments.

TL;DR: NC-Iso是一种新颖的图神经网络架构，通过保持节点根子树中相邻层级间的层次依赖关系来解决子图匹配中的尺度差异问题，并引入相似性主导比增强度量来提高匹配对的排序能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于GNN的子图匹配方法存在两个主要问题：1）编码过程中图对间的尺度差异，关注特征数量但忽略特征在节点根子树中的相对位置；2）铰链距离度量对匹配图对缺乏区分度，影响排序应用。

Method: 提出NC-Iso架构，通过构建节点根子树中相邻层级间的层次依赖关系来保持特征的相对位置，确保匹配图对在特征数量满足包含约束的同时保持一致的层次结构。引入相似性主导比增强度量来量化图对间相似性相对于不相似性的主导程度。

Result: 在九个数据集上的实证结果验证了NC-Iso的有效性、泛化能力、可扩展性和可迁移性，同时保持了时间效率。

Conclusion: NC-Iso为子图检索提供了一种更具区分度的神经子图匹配解决方案，解决了现有方法的尺度差异和排序能力不足的问题。

Abstract: Subgraph matching is challenging as it necessitates time-consuming
combinatorial searches. Recent Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based approaches
address this issue by employing GNN encoders to extract graph information and
hinge distance measures to ensure containment constraints in the embedding
space. These methods significantly shorten the response time, making them
promising solutions for subgraph retrieval. However, they suffer from scale
differences between graph pairs during encoding, as they focus on feature
counts but overlook the relative positions of features within node-rooted
subtrees, leading to disturbed containment constraints and false predictions.
Additionally, their hinge distance measures lack discriminative power for
matched graph pairs, hindering ranking applications. We propose NC-Iso, a novel
GNN architecture for neural subgraph matching. NC-Iso preserves the relative
positions of features by building the hierarchical dependencies between
adjacent echelons within node-rooted subtrees, ensuring matched graph pairs
maintain consistent hierarchies while complying with containment constraints in
feature counts. To enhance the ranking ability for matched pairs, we introduce
a novel similarity dominance ratio-enhanced measure, which quantifies the
dominance of similarity over dissimilarity between graph pairs. Empirical
results on nine datasets validate the effectiveness, generalization ability,
scalability, and transferability of NC-Iso while maintaining time efficiency,
offering a more discriminative neural subgraph matching solution for subgraph
retrieval. Code available at https://github.com/liuzhouyang/NC-Iso.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个从字典学习推导稀疏自编码器的理论框架，发现现有SAE变体存在只能表示单向概念的局限性，并提出新的AbsTopK SAE变体来解决这个问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有稀疏自编码器缺乏统一的理论推导框架，且由于正则化器强制非负性，无法表示双向概念（如男/女），导致语义轴分裂成冗余特征。

Method: 通过展开稀疏编码的近端梯度方法建立理论框架，提出AbsTopK SAE变体，基于ℓ0稀疏约束对最大幅度激活进行硬阈值处理，保留正负激活。

Result: 在4个LLM和7个任务上的实验表明，AbsTopK提高了重建保真度、增强了解释性，使单个特征能够编码对比概念，性能匹配甚至超过需要标签数据的监督方法。

Conclusion: AbsTopK SAE通过保留双向激活解决了现有SAE的局限性，提供了更丰富的概念表示，在无监督设置下达到了监督方法的性能水平。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as powerful techniques for
interpretability of large language models (LLMs), aiming to decompose hidden
states into meaningful semantic features. While several SAE variants have been
proposed, there remains no principled framework to derive SAEs from the
original dictionary learning formulation. In this work, we introduce such a
framework by unrolling the proximal gradient method for sparse coding. We show
that a single-step update naturally recovers common SAE variants, including
ReLU, JumpReLU, and TopK. Through this lens, we reveal a fundamental limitation
of existing SAEs: their sparsity-inducing regularizers enforce non-negativity,
preventing a single feature from representing bidirectional concepts (e.g.,
male vs. female). This structural constraint fragments semantic axes into
separate, redundant features, limiting representational completeness. To
address this issue, we propose AbsTopK SAE, a new variant derived from the
$\ell_0$ sparsity constraint that applies hard thresholding over the
largest-magnitude activations. By preserving both positive and negative
activations, AbsTopK uncovers richer, bidirectional conceptual representations.
Comprehensive experiments across four LLMs and seven probing and steering tasks
show that AbsTopK improves reconstruction fidelity, enhances interpretability,
and enables single features to encode contrasting concepts. Remarkably, AbsTopK
matches or even surpasses the Difference-in-Mean method, a supervised approach
that requires labeled data for each concept and has been shown in prior work to
outperform SAEs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有零阶方法依赖手工制作的静态采样策略，无法适应模型特定结构。观察到实践中只有少量基础模型及其衍生模型被广泛采用，因此为给定LLM学习一次优化器并在不同下游任务中重用是可行且理想的。

Method: 设计基于学习的零阶优化器，通过紧凑内存高效架构自动学习扰动策略，支持每个基础模型一次性训练，最小化开销。

Result: 在4个LLM和7个数据集上的实验表明，ZO Fine-tuner在82.1%的任务-模型组合中优于现有零阶基线方法。

Conclusion: ZO Fine-tuner展示了强大的性能和可扩展性，为高效LLM微调提供了有效解决方案，能够将学习到学习(L2L)扩展到基础模型时代。

Abstract: Zeroth-order optimizers have recently emerged as a practical approach for
fine-tuning large language models (LLMs), significantly reducing GPU memory
consumption compared to traditional first-order methods. Yet, existing
zeroth-order methods rely on hand-crafted, static sampling strategies that are
not adaptable to model-specific structures. To address this, we propose ZO
Fine-tuner, a learning-based zeroth-order optimizer for LLMs that automatically
learns efficient perturbation strategies through a compact and memory-efficient
design. Crucially, our approach is motivated by the observation that only a
small number of foundation models and their derivatives are widely adopted in
practice. Therefore, learning the optimizer once for a given LLM and reusing it
across diverse downstream tasks is both feasible and highly desirable.
Accordingly, ZO Fine-tuner is designed to scale learning to learn (L2L) to the
foundation-model era by supporting one-time training per LLM with minimal
overhead. Experiments on 4 LLMs and 7 datasets show that ZO Fine-tuner
outperforms prior zeroth-order baselines in 82.1\% of task-model combinations,
thereby demonstrating strong performance and scalability for efficient LLM
fine-tuning. Our code is available at

Conclusion: 临床上下文对于自动化放射学报告生成至关重要，公开了数据集、代码和检查点以促进未来研究。

Abstract: Automated structured radiology report generation (SRRG) from chest X-ray
images offers significant potential to reduce workload of radiologists by
generating reports in structured formats that ensure clarity, consistency, and
adherence to clinical reporting standards. While radiologists effectively
utilize available clinical contexts in their diagnostic reasoning, existing
SRRG systems overlook these essential elements. This fundamental gap leads to
critical problems including temporal hallucinations when referencing
non-existent clinical contexts. To address these limitations, we propose
contextualized SRRG (C-SRRG) that comprehensively incorporates rich clinical
context for SRRG. We curate C-SRRG dataset by integrating comprehensive
clinical context encompassing 1) multi-view X-ray images, 2) clinical
indication, 3) imaging techniques, and 4) prior studies with corresponding
comparisons based on patient histories. Through extensive benchmarking with
state-of-the-art multimodal large language models, we demonstrate that
incorporating clinical context with the proposed C-SRRG significantly improves
report generation quality. We publicly release dataset, code, and checkpoints
to facilitate future research for clinically-aligned automated RRG at

TL;DR: PromptLoop是一个基于强化学习的即插即用框架，通过多模态大语言模型在扩散模型采样过程中逐步优化提示词，实现有效的奖励优化和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于强化学习的扩散模型微调方法在泛化性、组合性和抗奖励破解方面存在不足，而现有的提示词优化方法大多采用前馈方式，未能充分利用强化学习的序列特性。

Method: 训练一个多模态大语言模型，基于扩散模型的中间潜在状态，使用强化学习逐步迭代更新提示词，而不是直接修改扩散模型的权重。

Result: 在各种奖励函数和扩散模型骨干上的广泛实验表明，PromptLoop能有效优化奖励、无缝泛化到未见过的模型、与现有对齐方法正交组合，并缓解过优化和奖励破解问题。

Conclusion: PromptLoop通过将潜在反馈融入逐步提示词优化，实现了与Diffusion RL类似的结构类比，同时保持了基于提示词对齐的灵活性和通用性。

Abstract: Despite the recent progress, reinforcement learning (RL)-based fine-tuning of
diffusion models often struggles with generalization, composability, and
robustness against reward hacking. Recent studies have explored prompt
refinement as a modular alternative, but most adopt a feed-forward approach
that applies a single refined prompt throughout the entire sampling trajectory,
thereby failing to fully leverage the sequential nature of reinforcement
learning. To address this, here we introduce PromptLoop, a plug-and-play RL
framework that incorporates latent feedback into step-wise prompt refinement.
Rather than modifying diffusion model weights, a multimodal large language
model (MLLM) is trained with RL to iteratively update prompts based on
intermediate latent states of diffusion models. This design achieves a
structural analogy to the Diffusion RL approach, while retaining the
flexibility and generality of prompt-based alignment. Extensive experiments
across diverse reward functions and diffusion backbones demonstrate that
PromptLoop (i) achieves effective reward optimization, (ii) generalizes
seamlessly to unseen models, (iii) composes orthogonally with existing
alignment methods, and (iv) mitigates over-optimization and reward hacking.

Abstract: Data augmentation has been widely employed to improve the generalization of
deep neural networks. Most existing methods apply fixed or random
transformations. However, we find that sample difficulty evolves along with the
model's generalization capabilities in dynamic training environments. As a
result, applying uniform or stochastic augmentations, without accounting for
such dynamics, can lead to a mismatch between augmented data and the model's
evolving training needs, ultimately degrading training effectiveness. To
address this, we introduce SADA, a Sample-Aware Dynamic Augmentation that
performs on-the-fly adjustment of augmentation strengths based on each sample's
evolving influence on model optimization. Specifically, we estimate each
sample's influence by projecting its gradient onto the accumulated model update
direction and computing the temporal variance within a local training window.
Samples with low variance, indicating stable and consistent influence, are
augmented more strongly to emphasize diversity, while unstable samples receive
milder transformations to preserve semantic fidelity and stabilize learning.
Our method is lightweight, which does not require auxiliary models or policy
tuning. It can be seamlessly integrated into existing training pipelines as a
plug-and-play module. Experiments across various benchmark datasets and model
architectures show consistent improvements of SADA, including +7.3\% on
fine-grained tasks and +4.3\% on long-tailed datasets, highlighting the
method's effectiveness and practicality.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了首个将控制理论矩阵素描技术应用于神经网络层激活的方法，通过指数移动平均和自适应秩调整来平衡内存效率与近似质量，实现内存高效的梯度重构。

Motivation: 神经网络训练中存储层激活的内存需求带来了显著的可扩展性挑战，需要内存高效的梯度重构方法。

Method: 采用控制理论矩阵素描技术，使用三个互补的素描矩阵通过指数移动平均和自适应秩调整来素描层激活。

Result: 在MNIST、CIFAR-10和物理信息神经网络上的实证评估展示了可控的精度-内存权衡，并在MNIST上演示了实时梯度范数跟踪应用。

Conclusion: 素描激活存储为内存高效的神经网络训练和分析提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Neural network training relies on gradient computation through
backpropagation, yet memory requirements for storing layer activations present
significant scalability challenges. We present the first adaptation of
control-theoretic matrix sketching to neural network layer activations,
enabling memory-efficient gradient reconstruction in backpropagation. This work
builds on recent matrix sketching frameworks for dynamic optimization problems,
where similar state trajectory storage challenges motivate sketching
techniques. Our approach sketches layer activations using three complementary
sketch matrices maintained through exponential moving averages (EMA) with
adaptive rank adjustment, automatically balancing memory efficiency against
approximation quality. Empirical evaluation on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and
physics-informed neural networks demonstrates a controllable accuracy-memory
tradeoff. We demonstrate a gradient monitoring application on MNIST showing how
sketched activations enable real-time gradient norm tracking with minimal
memory overhead. These results establish that sketched activation storage
provides a viable path toward memory-efficient neural network training and
analysis.

TL;DR: UrbanGraph是一个物理信息框架，通过异质动态时空图预测城市微气候，在物理一致性、空间依赖性和时间变异性方面优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着快速城市化，预测城市微气候变得至关重要，因为它影响建筑能耗和公共健康风险。现有生成式和同质图方法在捕捉物理一致性、空间依赖性和时间变异性方面存在不足。

Method: 引入UrbanGraph框架，集成异质动态时空图，编码植被蒸散、遮阳和对流扩散等关键物理过程，同时建模不同城市实体间的复杂空间依赖及其时间演化。

Abstract: With rapid urbanization, predicting urban microclimates has become critical,
as it affects building energy demand and public health risks. However, existing
generative and homogeneous graph approaches fall short in capturing physical
consistency, spatial dependencies, and temporal variability. To address this,
we introduce UrbanGraph, a physics-informed framework integrating heterogeneous
and dynamic spatio-temporal graphs. It encodes key physical processes --
vegetation evapotranspiration, shading, and convective diffusion -- while
modeling complex spatial dependencies among diverse urban entities and their
temporal evolution. We evaluate UrbanGraph on UMC4/12, a physics-based
simulation dataset covering diverse urban configurations and climates. Results
show that UrbanGraph improves $R^2$ by up to 10.8% and reduces FLOPs by 17.0%
over all baselines, with heterogeneous and dynamic graphs contributing 3.5% and
7.1% gains. Our dataset provides the first high-resolution benchmark for
spatio-temporal microclimate modeling, and our method extends to broader urban
heterogeneous dynamic computing tasks.

Motivation: 现有异常检测方法主要关注点异常，无法处理时空数据中的时空依赖性，且多为监督方法，未考虑异常的具体结构特征。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效检测时空数据中的异常，同时考虑异常的稀疏性和时空平滑特性。

Abstract: Anomaly detection in spatiotemporal data is a challenging problem encountered
in a variety of applications, including video surveillance, medical imaging
data, and urban traffic monitoring. Existing anomaly detection methods focus
mainly on point anomalies and cannot deal with temporal and spatial
dependencies that arise in spatio-temporal data. Tensor-based anomaly detection
methods have been proposed to address this problem. Although existing methods
can capture dependencies across different modes, they are primarily supervised
and do not account for the specific structure of anomalies. Moreover, these
methods focus mainly on extracting anomalous features without providing any
statistical confidence. In this paper, we introduce an unsupervised
tensor-based anomaly detection method that simultaneously considers the sparse
and spatiotemporally smooth nature of anomalies. The anomaly detection problem
is formulated as a regularized robust low-rank + sparse tensor decomposition
where the total variation of the tensor with respect to the underlying spatial
and temporal graphs quantifies the spatiotemporal smoothness of the anomalies.
Once the anomalous features are extracted, we introduce a statistical anomaly
scoring framework that accounts for local spatio-temporal dependencies. The
proposed framework is evaluated on both synthetic and real data.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TimeEmb是一个轻量级的静态-动态分解框架，通过分离时间序列中的时间不变和时间变化成分来应对时间非平稳性问题，在减少计算资源的同时提升了预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时间序列分布随时间变化的时间非平稳性问题给可靠预测带来根本性挑战。现有方法往往混淆时间变化和时间不变成分，导致面对分布偏移时性能不佳。

Method: 提出静态-动态分解框架：时间不变成分通过全局嵌入模块学习跨时间序列的持久表示；时间变化成分通过频域滤波机制处理，灵感来自信号处理中的全频谱分析。

Result: 在真实世界数据集上的实验表明，TimeEmb优于最先进的基线方法，且需要更少的计算资源。该轻量级框架还能通过简单集成改进现有时间序列预测方法。

Conclusion: 静态-动态解纠缠能有效提升时间序列预测性能，TimeEmb框架为应对时间非平稳性问题提供了轻量高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Temporal non-stationarity, the phenomenon that time series distributions
change over time, poses fundamental challenges to reliable time series
forecasting. Intuitively, the complex time series can be decomposed into two
factors, \ie time-invariant and time-varying components, which indicate static
and dynamic patterns, respectively. Nonetheless, existing methods often
conflate the time-varying and time-invariant components, and jointly learn the
combined long-term patterns and short-term fluctuations, leading to suboptimal
performance facing distribution shifts. To address this issue, we initiatively
propose a lightweight static-dynamic decomposition framework, TimeEmb, for time
series forecasting. TimeEmb innovatively separates time series into two
complementary components: (1) time-invariant component, captured by a novel
global embedding module that learns persistent representations across time
series, and (2) time-varying component, processed by an efficient
frequency-domain filtering mechanism inspired by full-spectrum analysis in
signal processing. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that TimeEmb
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and requires fewer computational
resources. We conduct comprehensive quantitative and qualitative analyses to
verify the efficacy of static-dynamic disentanglement. This lightweight
framework can also improve existing time-series forecasting methods with simple
integration. To ease reproducibility, the code is available at
https://github.com/showmeon/TimeEmb.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需排练缓冲区和任务边界的在线持续学习方法F2OCL，通过结合提示学习和NCM分类器有效解决灾难性遗忘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有在线持续学习方法要么使用排练缓冲区存储样本（可能引发数据安全和隐私问题），要么依赖任务边界和身份识别（在单次数据处理中难以实现），因此需要研究无需排练和任务边界的在线持续学习。

Method: 将提示学习与NCM分类器相结合，在不存储样本且不使用任务边界或身份的情况下处理灾难性遗忘问题。

Result: 在两个基准数据集上的广泛实验证明了所提方法的有效性。

Conclusion: F2OCL方法成功解决了在线持续学习中的灾难性遗忘问题，无需依赖排练缓冲区或任务边界信息。

Abstract: The main challenge of continual learning is \textit{catastrophic forgetting}.
Because of processing data in one pass, online continual learning (OCL) is one
of the most difficult continual learning scenarios. To address catastrophic
forgetting in OCL, some existing studies use a rehearsal buffer to store
samples and replay them in the later learning process, other studies do not
store samples but assume a sequence of learning tasks so that the task
identities can be explored. However, storing samples may raise data security or
privacy concerns and it is not always possible to identify the boundaries
between learning tasks in one pass of data processing. It motivates us to
investigate rehearsal-free and task-free OCL (F2OCL). By integrating prompt
learning with an NCM classifier, this study has effectively tackled
catastrophic forgetting without storing samples and without usage of task
boundaries or identities. The extensive experimental results on two benchmarks
have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本研究表明，经验神经正切核（eNTK）的特征分析可以揭示训练后神经网络使用的特征。在两个标准机制可解释性玩具模型（叠加玩具模型和模加法上的单层MLP）中，eNTK显示出尖锐的谱悬崖，其顶部特征空间与真实特征对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究eNTK分析是否能够作为特征发现和检测小模型中相变的实用工具，特别是在机制可解释性领域。

Method: 在两个标准玩具模型（叠加玩具模型和模加法上的单层MLP）上进行实验，分析eNTK的特征谱和特征空间，并与真实特征进行比较。

Result: 在叠加玩具模型中，eNTK在稀疏（高叠加）和密集状态下都能恢复真实特征；在模算术中，eNTK可用于恢复傅里叶特征族；层间eNTK可将特征定位到特定层；eNTK特征谱的演化可用于诊断grokking相变。

Conclusion: eNTK分析为特征发现和小模型中的相变检测提供了实用的方法。

Abstract: We provide evidence that eigenanalysis of the empirical neural tangent kernel
(eNTK) can surface the features used by trained neural networks. Across two
standard toy models for mechanistic interpretability, Toy Models of
Superposition (TMS) and a 1-layer MLP trained on modular addition, we find that
the eNTK exhibits sharp spectral cliffs whose top eigenspaces align with
ground-truth features. In TMS, the eNTK recovers the ground-truth features in
both the sparse (high superposition) and dense regimes. In modular arithmetic,
the eNTK can be used to recover Fourier feature families. Moreover, we provide
evidence that a layerwise eNTK localizes features to specific layers and that
the evolution of the eNTK eigenspectrum can be used to diagnose the grokking
phase transition. These results suggest that eNTK analysis may provide a
practical handle for feature discovery and for detecting phase changes in small
models.

### [197] [Diagnosing Shortcut-Induced Rigidity in Continual Learning: The Einstellung Rigidity Index (ERI)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00475)
*Kai Gu,Weishi Shi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了Einstellung Rigidity Index (ERI)指标来诊断持续学习中的捷径特征依赖问题，发现在CIFAR-100基准测试中，持续学习方法虽然学习速度更快，但最终精度略低，且对干扰性捷径特征产生依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络经常利用捷径特征，这些特征在持续学习中会导致认知定势效应，阻碍新技能的获取。需要一种诊断方法来区分真正的知识迁移和捷径特征带来的性能提升。

Method: 引入ERI指标，包含三个可解释维度：适应延迟(AD)、性能缺陷(PD)和相对次优特征依赖(SFR_rel)。在CIFAR-100持续学习基准上测试了多种CL方法，并故意在第二阶段引入虚假的洋红色补丁作为捷径特征。

Result: CL方法比从头开始训练的基准模型更快达到精度阈值(负AD)，但在有补丁的捷径类别上最终精度略低(正PD)。遮挡补丁后CL方法精度提高而基准模型略有下降，产生负SFR_rel，表明补丁对CL模型是干扰而非帮助。

Conclusion: 持续学习方法容易受到捷径特征的干扰，导致认知定势效应。ERI指标能有效诊断这种刚性，帮助理解CL方法在分布变化下的鲁棒性问题。

Abstract: Deep neural networks frequently exploit shortcut features, defined as
incidental correlations between inputs and labels without causal meaning.
Shortcut features undermine robustness and reduce reliability under
distribution shifts. In continual learning (CL), the consequences of shortcut
exploitation can persist and intensify: weights inherited from earlier tasks
bias representation reuse toward whatever features most easily satisfied prior
labels, mirroring the cognitive Einstellung effect, a phenomenon where past
habits block optimal solutions. Whereas catastrophic forgetting erodes past
skills, shortcut-induced rigidity throttles the acquisition of new ones. We
introduce the Einstellung Rigidity Index (ERI), a compact diagnostic that
disentangles genuine transfer from cue-inflated performance using three
interpretable facets: (i) Adaptation Delay (AD), (ii) Performance Deficit (PD),
and (iii) Relative Suboptimal Feature Reliance (SFR_rel). On a two-phase
CIFAR-100 CL benchmark with a deliberately spurious magenta patch in Phase 2,
we evaluate Naive fine-tuning (SGD), online Elastic Weight Consolidation
(EWC_on), Dark Experience Replay (DER++), Gradient Projection Memory (GPM), and
Deep Generative Replay (DGR). Across these continual learning methods, we
observe that CL methods reach accuracy thresholds earlier than a Scratch-T2
baseline (negative AD) but achieve slightly lower final accuracy on patched
shortcut classes (positive PD). Masking the patch improves accuracy for CL
methods while slightly reducing Scratch-T2, yielding negative SFR_rel. This
pattern indicates the patch acted as a distractor for CL models in this setting
rather than a helpful shortcut.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DVD是一个基于潜在扩散模型的判别性迁移框架，用于源自由域自适应，通过扩散网络在潜在空间中生成源域样本来对齐目标域特征，无需访问原始源数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有潜在扩散模型主要关注生成任务，其在判别性迁移方面的潜力尚未充分探索。源自由域自适应面临无法访问原始源数据的核心挑战。

Method: 在源域训练阶段，将每个源域特征的标签信息编码到其潜在邻域中，通过高斯先验拟合k近邻并训练扩散网络。在适应阶段，从目标域特征的潜在邻域采样，应用冻结的扩散模块生成源域线索，使用InfoNCE损失对齐目标编码器。

Result: 在标准SFDA基准测试中，DVD优于最先进方法。相同的潜在扩散模块还能提高源分类器在域内数据的准确性，并在监督分类和域泛化实验中提升性能。

Conclusion: DVD将潜在扩散模型重新解释为实用的、保护隐私的显式知识转移桥梁，解决了源自由域自适应中先前方法未能解决的核心挑战。

Abstract: Recent work on latent diffusion models (LDMs) has focused almost exclusively
on generative tasks, leaving their potential for discriminative transfer
largely unexplored. We introduce Discriminative Vicinity Diffusion (DVD), a
novel LDM-based framework for a more practical variant of source-free domain
adaptation (SFDA): the source provider may share not only a pre-trained
classifier but also an auxiliary latent diffusion module, trained once on the
source data and never exposing raw source samples. DVD encodes each source
feature's label information into its latent vicinity by fitting a Gaussian
prior over its k-nearest neighbors and training the diffusion network to drift
noisy samples back to label-consistent representations. During adaptation, we
sample from each target feature's latent vicinity, apply the frozen diffusion
module to generate source-like cues, and use a simple InfoNCE loss to align the
target encoder to these cues, explicitly transferring decision boundaries
without source access. Across standard SFDA benchmarks, DVD outperforms
state-of-the-art methods. We further show that the same latent diffusion module
enhances the source classifier's accuracy on in-domain data and boosts
performance in supervised classification and domain generalization experiments.
DVD thus reinterprets LDMs as practical, privacy-preserving bridges for
explicit knowledge transfer, addressing a core challenge in source-free domain
adaptation that prior methods have yet to solve.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有黑盒域自适应方法主要针对视觉应用，无法直接应用于具有独特时空特性的时间序列数据，且尚未探索基础模型在黑盒时间序列域自适应中的潜力。

Method: 构建双分支网络结构，每个分支配备独特提示来捕捉数据分布的不同特征；在域自适应阶段开发提示级和输入级的重建学习，所有方法都基于时间序列基础模型。

Result: 在三个不同应用领域的时间序列数据集上的实验证明，CPFM相比竞争对手取得了显著改进的结果。

Conclusion: CPFM方法有效解决了黑盒时间序列域自适应问题，通过利用基础模型和跨提示学习机制，在多个数据集上表现出优越性能。

Abstract: The black-box domain adaptation (BBDA) topic is developed to address the
privacy and security issues where only an application programming interface
(API) of the source model is available for domain adaptations. Although the
BBDA topic has attracted growing research attentions, existing works mostly
target the vision applications and are not directly applicable to the
time-series applications possessing unique spatio-temporal characteristics. In
addition, none of existing approaches have explored the strength of foundation
model for black box time-series domain adaptation (BBTSDA). This paper proposes
a concept of Cross-Prompt Foundation Model (CPFM) for the BBTSDA problems. CPFM
is constructed under a dual branch network structure where each branch is
equipped with a unique prompt to capture different characteristics of data
distributions. In the domain adaptation phase, the reconstruction learning
phase in the prompt and input levels is developed. All of which are built upon
a time-series foundation model to overcome the spatio-temporal dynamic. Our
rigorous experiments substantiate the advantage of CPFM achieving improved
results with noticeable margins from its competitors in three time-series
datasets of different application domains.

TL;DR: 该研究比较了LLM推理的两种架构：双模型潜在推理与单模型统一架构。在匹配潜在token预算下，单模型统一架构几乎达到双模型性能，表明当前双模型设计主要增加计算而非显著改进推理质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLM推理应该采用分离模块还是单模型前向传递和表示空间的架构选择问题，测试双架构潜在推理的有效性。

Method: 在GPT-2和Qwen-3上测试两种假设：增加通道容量(H1)和通过联合微调学习通信(H2)，并与统一软嵌入基线比较。

Result: H2表现最强但H1增益有限，统一基线几乎匹配H2且超越H1。增加潜在token预算未能改善鲁棒性，潜在分析显示子空间重叠且专业化有限。

Conclusion: 双模型潜在推理在原理上有前景，但可能需要明确塑造潜在空间用于算法规划的目标和通信机制。

Abstract: Should LLM reasoning live in a separate module, or within a single model's
forward pass and representational space? We study dual-architecture latent
reasoning, where a fluent Base exchanges latent messages with a Coprocessor,
and test two hypotheses aimed at improving latent communication over Liu et al.
(2024): (H1) increase channel capacity; (H2) learn communication via joint
finetuning. Under matched latent-token budgets on GPT-2 and Qwen-3, H2 is
consistently strongest while H1 yields modest gains. A unified soft-embedding
baseline, a single model with the same forward pass and shared representations,
using the same latent-token budget, nearly matches H2 and surpasses H1,
suggesting current dual designs mostly add compute rather than qualitatively
improving reasoning. Across GSM8K, ProsQA, and a Countdown stress test with
increasing branching factor, scaling the latent-token budget beyond small
values fails to improve robustness. Latent analyses show overlapping subspaces
with limited specialization, consistent with weak reasoning gains. We conclude
dual-model latent reasoning remains promising in principle, but likely requires
objectives and communication mechanisms that explicitly shape latent spaces for
algorithmic planning.

Motivation: 现有基于强化学习或直接反向传播的扩散对齐方法虽然能最大化奖励，但容易导致奖励过优化和模式崩溃问题。

Method: 采用变分期望最大化框架，E步通过测试时搜索生成多样且奖励对齐的样本，M步使用E步发现的样本优化扩散模型。

Result: DAV在连续和离散任务（文本到图像合成和DNA序列设计）中都能在优化奖励的同时保持多样性。

Conclusion: DAV框架有效解决了扩散对齐中的奖励过优化和模式崩溃问题，为扩散模型的下游任务优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Diffusion alignment aims to optimize diffusion models for the downstream
objective. While existing methods based on reinforcement learning or direct
backpropagation achieve considerable success in maximizing rewards, they often
suffer from reward over-optimization and mode collapse. We introduce Diffusion
Alignment as Variational Expectation-Maximization (DAV), a framework that
formulates diffusion alignment as an iterative process alternating between two
complementary phases: the E-step and the M-step. In the E-step, we employ
test-time search to generate diverse and reward-aligned samples. In the M-step,
we refine the diffusion model using samples discovered by the E-step. We
demonstrate that DAV can optimize reward while preserving diversity for both
continuous and discrete tasks: text-to-image synthesis and DNA sequence design.

TL;DR: Differential Attention (DA) 通过减法结构抑制冗余上下文，减少幻觉，但引入了对抗性扰动下的结构脆弱性，导致梯度范数增加和局部Lipschitz常数升高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究DA注意力机制在提高任务相关焦点同时，是否引入了对抗性脆弱性，揭示选择性注意力与鲁棒性之间的基本权衡。

Method: 理论分析识别负梯度对齐作为敏感性放大的关键驱动因素，并通过在ViT/DiffViT和预训练CLIP/DiffCLIP上的系统实验进行实证验证，涵盖五个数据集。

Result: 实验显示DA相比标准注意力具有更高的攻击成功率、频繁的梯度对立和更强的局部敏感性。深度相关实验揭示了鲁棒性交叉：堆叠DA层通过深度相关噪声抵消衰减小扰动，但在大攻击预算下保护减弱。

Conclusion: DA在干净输入上改善了判别性焦点，但增加了对抗性脆弱性，强调了未来注意力机制需要同时考虑选择性和鲁棒性的联合设计。

Abstract: Differential Attention (DA) has been proposed as a refinement to standard
attention, suppressing redundant or noisy context through a subtractive
structure and thereby reducing contextual hallucination. While this design
sharpens task-relevant focus, we show that it also introduces a structural
fragility under adversarial perturbations. Our theoretical analysis identifies
negative gradient alignment-a configuration encouraged by DA's subtraction-as
the key driver of sensitivity amplification, leading to increased gradient
norms and elevated local Lipschitz constants. We empirically validate this
Fragile Principle through systematic experiments on ViT/DiffViT and evaluations
of pretrained CLIP/DiffCLIP, spanning five datasets in total. These results
demonstrate higher attack success rates, frequent gradient opposition, and
stronger local sensitivity compared to standard attention. Furthermore,
depth-dependent experiments reveal a robustness crossover: stacking DA layers
attenuates small perturbations via depth-dependent noise cancellation, though
this protection fades under larger attack budgets. Overall, our findings
uncover a fundamental trade-off: DA improves discriminative focus on clean
inputs but increases adversarial vulnerability, underscoring the need to
jointly design for selectivity and robustness in future attention mechanisms.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种分析前馈网络(FFN)频谱利用的方法，发现软秩随宽度呈幂律增长而硬秩增长缓慢，表明增加FFN宽度主要添加低能量方向，而主导模式子空间早期饱和。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有缩放定律关注模型大小与损失的关系，但忽略了组件如何利用潜在空间。本文旨在研究FFN的频谱利用情况，量化潜在方向的有效激活程度。

Method: 使用轻量级诊断套件：硬秩（参与比）、软秩（香农秩）、频谱集中度和复合频谱利用指数(SUI)，在LLaMA、GPT-2和nGPT系列模型上量化有意义的潜在方向激活情况。

Result: 发现不对称频谱缩放定律：软秩随FFN宽度几乎完美遵循幂律，而硬秩仅呈次线性增长且方差高。在更大宽度下，方差进一步坍缩到狭窄子空间，导致大部分潜在空间未充分利用。

Conclusion: 将FFN宽度选择重新定义为尾部容量与主导模式容量之间的权衡，为推理高效的LLM设计提供具体指导。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) scale, the question is not only how large
they become, but how much of their capacity is effectively utilized. Existing
scaling laws relate model size to loss, yet overlook how components exploit
their latent space. We study feed-forward networks (FFNs) and recast width
selection as a spectral utilization problem. Using a lightweight diagnostic
suite -- Hard Rank (participation ratio), Soft Rank (Shannon rank), Spectral
Concentration, and the composite Spectral Utilization Index (SUI) -- we
quantify how many latent directions are meaningfully activated across LLaMA,
GPT-2, and nGPT families. Our key finding is an asymmetric spectral scaling
law: soft rank follows an almost perfect power law with FFN width, while hard
rank grows only sublinearly and with high variance. This asymmetry suggests
that widening FFNs mostly adds low-energy tail directions, while dominant-mode
subspaces saturate early. Moreover, at larger widths, variance further
collapses into a narrow subspace, leaving much of the latent space
under-utilized. These results recast FFN width selection as a principled
trade-off between tail capacity and dominant-mode capacity, offering concrete
guidance for inference-efficient LLM design.

Conclusion: 集成方法与可解释性的结合能有效应对公共卫生挑战。未来研究应探索先进的插补策略、替代算法（如神经网络）和更新数据，以进一步提高预测准确性，支持基于证据的全球卫生政策制定。

Abstract: Life expectancy is a fundamental indicator of population health and
socio-economic well-being, yet accurately forecasting it remains challenging
due to the interplay of demographic, environmental, and healthcare factors.
This study evaluates three machine learning models -- Linear Regression (LR),
Regression Decision Tree (RDT), and Random Forest (RF), using a real-world
dataset drawn from World Health Organization (WHO) and United Nations (UN)
sources. After extensive preprocessing to address missing values and
inconsistencies, each model's performance was assessed with $R^2$, Mean
Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). Results show that RF
achieves the highest predictive accuracy ($R^2 = 0.9423$), significantly
outperforming LR and RDT. Interpretability was prioritized through p-values for
LR and feature importance metrics for the tree-based models, revealing
immunization rates (diphtheria, measles) and demographic attributes (HIV/AIDS,
adult mortality) as critical drivers of life-expectancy predictions. These
insights underscore the synergy between ensemble methods and transparency in
addressing public-health challenges. Future research should explore advanced
imputation strategies, alternative algorithms (e.g., neural networks), and
updated data to further refine predictive accuracy and support evidence-based
policymaking in global health contexts.

TL;DR: 研究发现RL训练中LLM参数更新的两个关键特性：秩1主导性和秩1线性动态，基于此提出AlphaRL加速框架，实现2.5倍加速且保持96%以上推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管强化学习推动了LLM推理能力的显著提升，但RL训练过程中的参数动态变化机制仍不明确，需要深入理解以优化训练效率。

Method: 通过分析8个LLM和7种算法，识别出参数更新的两个基本特性，并基于这些发现开发AlphaRL加速框架，利用早期训练窗口外推最终参数更新。

Result: 实验验证了秩1主导性（恢复99%性能增益）和秩1线性动态的普适性，AlphaRL实现2.5倍加速同时保持>96%推理性能。

Conclusion: 这些发现为大规模RL训练提供了原理性、可解释且高效的训练范式，开辟了优化LLM训练的新路径。

Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) are
largely driven by reinforcement learning (RL), yet the underlying parameter
dynamics during RL training remain poorly understood. This work identifies two
fundamental properties of RL-induced parameter updates in LLMs: (1) Rank-1
Dominance, where the top singular subspace of the parameter update matrix
nearly fully determines reasoning improvements, recovering over 99\% of
performance gains; and (2) Rank-1 Linear Dynamics, where this dominant subspace
evolves linearly throughout training, enabling accurate prediction from early
checkpoints. Extensive experiments across 8 LLMs and 7 algorithms validate the
generalizability of these properties. More importantly, based on these
findings, we propose AlphaRL, a plug-in acceleration framework that
extrapolates the final parameter update using a short early training window,
achieving up to 2.5 speedup while retaining \textgreater 96\% of reasoning
performance without extra modules or hyperparameter tuning. This positions our
finding as a versatile and practical tool for large-scale RL, opening a path
toward principled, interpretable, and efficient training paradigm for LLMs.

Motivation: 状态空间模型虽表现出超越Transformer的潜力，但缺乏对其学习动态的理论解释，限制了对其高性能机制的理解和改进。

Method: 通过分析输入时间序列在状态中的存储方式评估SSM的记忆能力，建立S4模型与简化对角循环权重模型的等价性，并基于理论分析提出固定循环权重的训练策略。

Result: 实验证实延长记忆困难，强调初始化重要性；固定循环权重可获得相当或更好性能，且收敛更快。

Conclusion: 研究为SSM提供了新的理论基础，并提出了潜在的优化策略，即通过固定循环权重来改善训练效果。

Abstract: State space models (SSMs) have gained attention by showing potential to
outperform Transformers. However, previous studies have not sufficiently
addressed the mechanisms underlying their high performance owing to a lack of
theoretical explanation of SSMs' learning dynamics. In this study, we provide
such an explanation and propose an improved training strategy. The memory
capacity of SSMs can be evaluated by examining how input time series are stored
in their current state. Such an examination reveals a tradeoff between memory
accuracy and length, as well as the theoretical equivalence between the
structured state space sequence model (S4) and a simplified S4 with diagonal
recurrent weights. This theoretical foundation allows us to elucidate the
learning dynamics, proving the importance of initial parameters. Our analytical
results suggest that successful learning requires the initial memory structure
to be the longest possible even if memory accuracy may deteriorate or the
gradient lose the teacher information. Experiments on tasks requiring long
memory confirmed that extending memory is difficult, emphasizing the importance
of initialization. Furthermore, we found that fixing recurrent weights can be
more advantageous than adapting them because it achieves comparable or even
higher performance with faster convergence. Our results provide a new
theoretical foundation for SSMs and potentially offer a novel optimization
strategy.

TL;DR: PANORAMA通过机器学习驱动的正交变换解决ANNS验证瓶颈，将90%以上信号能量压缩到前一半维度，实现早期候选剪枝和部分距离计算，在多种ANNS方法中实现2-30倍端到端加速且无召回损失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前ANNS系统在最终精炼阶段花费高达99%的查询时间来计算距离，存在显著的验证瓶颈。

Method: 使用数据自适应的学习正交变换，通过级联式距离边界精炼来压缩信号能量，结合层级主内存布局、SIMD向量化部分距离计算和缓存感知访问模式。

Result: 在多种数据集（CIFAR-10、GIST、OpenAI Ada 2和Large 3等）上测试，PANORAMA实现了2-30倍的端到端加速，且没有召回损失。

Conclusion: PANORAMA成功解决了ANNS验证瓶颈，显著提升了查询效率，为大规模向量检索应用提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Approximate Nearest-Neighbor Search (ANNS) efficiently finds data items whose
embeddings are close to that of a given query in a high-dimensional space,
aiming to balance accuracy with speed. Used in recommendation systems, image
and video retrieval, natural language processing, and retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG), ANNS algorithms such as IVFPQ, HNSW graphs, Annoy, and MRPT
utilize graph, tree, clustering, and quantization techniques to navigate large
vector spaces. Despite this progress, ANNS systems spend up to 99\% of query
time to compute distances in their final refinement phase. In this paper, we
present PANORAMA, a machine learning-driven approach that tackles the ANNS
verification bottleneck through data-adaptive learned orthogonal transforms
that facilitate the accretive refinement of distance bounds. Such transforms
compact over 90\% of signal energy into the first half of dimensions, enabling
early candidate pruning with partial distance computations. We integrate
PANORAMA into state-of-the-art ANNS methods, namely IVFPQ/Flat, HNSW, MRPT, and
Annoy, without index modification, using level-major memory layouts,
SIMD-vectorized partial distance computations, and cache-aware access patterns.
Experiments across diverse datasets -- from image-based CIFAR-10 and GIST to
modern embedding spaces including OpenAI's Ada 2 and Large 3 -- demonstrate
that PANORAMA affords a 2--30$\times$ end-to-end speedup with no recall loss.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前Golowich和Livni的工作在可实现设置下针对遗忘型对手实现了O_d(log T)的错误界限，但对自适应对手只能达到O_d(√T)的次优界限。本文旨在填补这一差距，同时扩展研究到更一般的不可知设置。

Method: 提出新的私有在线学习算法，针对具有有限Littlestone维度的概念类，在可实现设置下改进对抗自适应对手的性能，并在不可知设置下设计算法获得次线性遗憾。

Result: 在可实现设置下，新算法对抗自适应对手的错误界限为O_d(log T)，填补了先前工作的空白。在不可知设置下，算法获得了O_d(√T)的次线性遗憾界限，证明了有限Littlestone维度概念类在不可知设置下也是私有在线可学习的。

Conclusion: 本文证明了具有有限Littlestone维度的概念类在私有在线学习中的强大能力，不仅在可实现设置下对抗自适应对手达到了最优错误界限，而且在更一般的不可知设置下也能获得次线性遗憾，扩展了私有在线学习的理论边界。

Abstract: We revisit the problem of private online learning, in which a learner
receives a sequence of $T$ data points and has to respond at each time-step a
hypothesis. It is required that the entire stream of output hypotheses should
satisfy differential privacy. Prior work of Golowich and Livni [2021]
established that every concept class $\mathcal{H}$ with finite Littlestone
dimension $d$ is privately online learnable in the realizable setting. In
particular, they proposed an algorithm that achieves an $O_{d}(\log T)$ mistake
bound against an oblivious adversary. However, their approach yields a
suboptimal $\tilde{O}_{d}(\sqrt{T})$ bound against an adaptive adversary. In
this work, we present a new algorithm with a mistake bound of $O_{d}(\log T)$
against an adaptive adversary, closing this gap. We further investigate the
problem in the agnostic setting, which is more general than the realizable
setting as it does not impose any assumptions on the data. We give an algorithm
that obtains a sublinear regret of $\tilde{O}_d(\sqrt{T})$ for generic
Littlestone classes, demonstrating that they are also privately online
learnable in the agnostic setting.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Eyes-on-Me是一种模块化的RAG数据投毒攻击方法，通过可重用的注意力吸引器和焦点区域分解对抗文档，实现低成本适应新目标，显著提高攻击成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG系统数据投毒攻击扩展性差，需要为每个目标短语优化投毒文档，成本高昂。

Method: 将对抗文档分解为可重用的注意力吸引器和焦点区域，吸引器优化用于引导注意力到焦点区域，攻击者可插入检索器语义诱饵或生成器恶意指令，通过控制一小部分与攻击成功强相关的注意力头实现零成本适应新目标。

Result: 在18个端到端RAG设置中，平均攻击成功率从21.9%提升至57.8%（+35.9个百分点，是先前工作的2.6倍），单个优化的吸引器无需重新训练即可迁移到未见过的黑盒检索器和生成器。

Conclusion: 建立了可扩展的RAG数据投毒范式，模块化可重用组件对现代AI系统构成实际威胁，同时揭示了注意力集中与模型输出之间的强关联，为可解释性研究提供信息。

Abstract: Existing data poisoning attacks on retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
systems scale poorly because they require costly optimization of poisoned
documents for each target phrase. We introduce Eyes-on-Me, a modular attack
that decomposes an adversarial document into reusable Attention Attractors and
Focus Regions. Attractors are optimized to direct attention to the Focus
Region. Attackers can then insert semantic baits for the retriever or malicious
instructions for the generator, adapting to new targets at near zero cost. This
is achieved by steering a small subset of attention heads that we empirically
identify as strongly correlated with attack success. Across 18 end-to-end RAG
settings (3 datasets $\times$ 2 retrievers $\times$ 3 generators), Eyes-on-Me
raises average attack success rates from 21.9 to 57.8 (+35.9 points,
2.6$\times$ over prior work). A single optimized attractor transfers to unseen
black box retrievers and generators without retraining. Our findings establish
a scalable paradigm for RAG data poisoning and show that modular, reusable
components pose a practical threat to modern AI systems. They also reveal a
strong link between attention concentration and model outputs, informing
interpretability research.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的校准指标ETCE来评估降水临近预报的概率校准质量，并扩展了计算机视觉中的后处理技术到预报领域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经天气模型(NWMs)可能产生校准不良的概率预报，而标准校准指标如ECE无法有效捕捉不同降水阈值下的校准误差。

Method: 引入期望阈值校准误差(ETCE)指标，并扩展计算机视觉中的后处理技术，采用选择性缩放和提前时间条件化方法。

Result: 选择性缩放结合提前时间条件化能够在不降低预报质量的情况下减少模型校准误差。

Conclusion: ETCE指标能更好地捕捉有序类别（如降水量）的校准误差，所提出的后处理方法有效改善了降水临近预报的校准性能。

Abstract: Reliable precipitation nowcasting is critical for weather-sensitive
decision-making, yet neural weather models (NWMs) can produce poorly calibrated
probabilistic forecasts. Standard calibration metrics such as the expected
calibration error (ECE) fail to capture miscalibration across precipitation
thresholds. We introduce the expected thresholded calibration error (ETCE), a
new metric that better captures miscalibration in ordered classes like
precipitation amounts. We extend post-processing techniques from computer
vision to the forecasting domain. Our results show that selective scaling with
lead time conditioning reduces model miscalibration without reducing the
forecast quality.

TL;DR: 提出结构因果最优传输方法，通过结合结构方程信息来增强分布鲁棒优化中的模糊集，提高分布的现实性，并开发了高效的松弛算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅利用因果图信息设计模糊集，未能充分利用结构方程信息，导致分布鲁棒优化中的模糊集可能不够现实。

Method: 引入结构因果最优传输及其模糊集，提出松弛版本用正则化项替代复杂因果约束，通过凸差规划实现高效求解。

Result: 方法能有效处理维度灾难问题，实现维度无关的快速收缩，在结构信息缺失时仍保持有效性并提供有限样本保证。

Conclusion: 结构因果最优传输通过整合结构方程信息显著提升了模糊集的现实性和计算效率，为分布鲁棒优化提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Distributionally robust optimization tackles out-of-sample issues like
overfitting and distribution shifts by adopting an adversarial approach over a
range of possible data distributions, known as the ambiguity set. To balance
conservatism and accuracy, these sets must include realistic probability
distributions by leveraging information from the nominal distribution. Assuming
that nominal distributions arise from a structural causal model with a directed
acyclic graph $\mathcal{G}$ and structural equations, previous methods such as
adapted and $\mathcal{G}$-causal optimal transport have only utilized causal
graph information in designing ambiguity sets. In this work, we propose
incorporating structural equations, which include causal graph information, to
enhance ambiguity sets, resulting in more realistic distributions. We introduce
structural causal optimal transport and its associated ambiguity set,
demonstrating their advantages and connections to previous methods. A key
benefit of our approach is a relaxed version, where a regularization term
replaces the complex causal constraints, enabling an efficient algorithm via
difference-of-convex programming to solve structural causal optimal transport.
We also show that when structural information is absent and must be estimated,
our approach remains effective and provides finite sample guarantees. Lastly,
we address the radius of ambiguity sets, illustrating how our method overcomes
the curse of dimensionality in optimal transport problems, achieving faster
shrinkage with dimension-free order.

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In many real-world applications such as recommendation systems, multiple
learning agents must balance exploration and exploitation while maintaining
safety guarantees to avoid catastrophic failures. We study the stochastic
linear bandit problem in a multi-agent networked setting where agents must
satisfy stage-wise conservative constraints. A network of $N$ agents
collaboratively maximizes cumulative reward while ensuring that the expected
reward at every round is no less than $(1-\alpha)$ times that of a baseline
policy. Each agent observes local rewards with unknown parameters, but the
network optimizes for the global parameter (average of local parameters).
Agents communicate only with immediate neighbors, and each communication round
incurs additional regret. We propose MA-SCLUCB (Multi-Agent Stage-wise
Conservative Linear UCB), an episodic algorithm alternating between action
selection and consensus-building phases. We prove that MA-SCLUCB achieves
regret
$\tilde{O}\left(\frac{d}{\sqrt{N}}\sqrt{T}\cdot\frac{\log(NT)}{\sqrt{\log(1/|\lambda_2|)}}\right)$
with high probability, where $d$ is the dimension, $T$ is the horizon, and
$|\lambda_2|$ is the network's second largest eigenvalue magnitude. Our
analysis shows: (i) collaboration yields $\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}$ improvement
despite local communication, (ii) communication overhead grows only
logarithmically for well-connected networks, and (iii) stage-wise safety adds
only lower-order regret. Thus, distributed learning with safety guarantees
achieves near-optimal performance in reasonably connected networks.

TL;DR: FAME是一个端到端的数据驱动框架，用于函数对函数回归，通过结合双向神经控制微分方程和混合专家驱动的向量场来捕捉函数内连续性，并使用多头交叉注意力融合函数间依赖关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 函数数据在科学和工程中很重要，但无限维特性使表示学习具有挑战性。传统统计模型依赖预选基展开或核，限制了数据驱动发现的灵活性，而许多深度学习管道将函数视为固定网格向量，忽略了固有连续性。

Method: FAME结合双向神经控制微分方程与混合专家驱动的向量场形成连续注意力，捕捉函数内连续性；使用多头交叉注意力融合函数间依赖关系。

Result: 在合成和真实世界函数回归基准测试中，FAME实现了最先进的准确性，对任意采样的函数离散观测具有强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: FAME是一个完全数据驱动的端到端框架，在函数对函数回归任务中表现出色，能够有效处理函数数据的连续性和依赖关系。

Abstract: Functional data play a pivotal role across science and engineering, yet their
infinite-dimensional nature makes representation learning challenging.
Conventional statistical models depend on pre-chosen basis expansions or
kernels, limiting the flexibility of data-driven discovery, while many
deep-learning pipelines treat functions as fixed-grid vectors, ignoring
inherent continuity. In this paper, we introduce Functional Attention with a
Mixture-of-Experts (FAME), an end-to-end, fully data-driven framework for
function-on-function regression. FAME forms continuous attention by coupling a
bidirectional neural controlled differential equation with MoE-driven vector
fields to capture intra-functional continuity, and further fuses change to
inter-functional dependencies via multi-head cross attention. Extensive
experiments on synthetic and real-world functional-regression benchmarks show
that FAME achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, strong robustness to arbitrarily
sampled discrete observations of functions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Muon、Scion和Gluon等优化器虽然通过利用层式线性最小化预言器在非欧几里得范数球上推进了大规模深度学习，但缺乏原则性的分布式框架，通信瓶颈未解决，且现有的分布式变体都是启发式的，没有收敛保证。

Method: 提出EF21-Muon，首个具有严格收敛保证的通信高效非欧几里得LMO优化器，支持随机梯度、动量和双向压缩，并首次将误差反馈扩展到非欧几里得设置。

Result: EF21-Muon在压缩关闭且选择特定范数时恢复Muon/Scion/Gluon，提供了该强大优化器家族的首个高效分布式实现。在NanoGPT基准测试中，相比未压缩的Muon/Scion/Gluon实现了高达7倍的通信节省且无精度损失。

Conclusion: EF21-Muon填补了非欧几里得LMO优化器分布式实现的空白，具有严格的收敛保证，能够显著减少通信开销，同时保持模型性能，为大规模深度学习训练提供了高效的分布式解决方案。

Abstract: Recent optimizers like Muon, Scion, and Gluon have pushed the frontier of
large-scale deep learning by exploiting layer-wise linear minimization oracles
(LMOs) over non-Euclidean norm balls, capturing neural network structure in
ways traditional algorithms cannot. Yet, no principled distributed framework
exists for these methods, and communication bottlenecks remain unaddressed. The
very few distributed variants are heuristic, with no convergence guarantees in
sight. We introduce EF21-Muon, the first communication-efficient, non-Euclidean
LMO-based optimizer with rigorous convergence guarantees. EF21-Muon supports
stochastic gradients, momentum, and bidirectional compression with error
feedback-marking the first extension of error feedback beyond the Euclidean
setting. It recovers Muon/Scion/Gluon when compression is off and specific
norms are chosen, providing the first efficient distributed implementation of
this powerful family. Our theory covers non-Euclidean smooth and the more
general $(L^0, L^1)$-smooth setting, matching best-known Euclidean rates and
enabling faster convergence under suitable norm choices. We further extend the
analysis to layer-wise (generalized) smoothness regimes, capturing the
anisotropic structure of deep networks. Experiments on NanoGPT benchmarking
EF21-Muon against uncompressed Muon/Scion/Gluon demonstrate up to $7\times$
communication savings with no accuracy degradation.

Abstract: Physics-informed machine learning has been a promising data-driven and
physics-informed approach in geotechnical engineering. This study proposes a
physics-informed extreme learning machine (PIELM) framework for analyzing
tunneling-induced soil-pile interactions. The pile foundation is modeled as an
Euler-Bernoulli beam, and the surrounding soil is modeled as a Pasternak
foundation. The soil-pile interaction is formulated into a fourth-order
ordinary differential equation (ODE) that constitutes the physics-informed
component, while measured data are incorporated into PIELM as the data-driven
component. Combining physics and data yields a loss vector of the extreme
learning machine (ELM) network, which is trained within 1 second by the least
squares method. After validating the PIELM approach by the boundary element
method (BEM) and finite difference method (FDM), parametric studies are carried
out to examine the effects of ELM network architecture, data monitoring
locations and numbers on the performance of PIELM. The results indicate that
monitored data should be placed at positions where the gradients of pile
deflections are significant, such as at the pile tip/top and near tunneling
zones. Two application examples highlight the critical role of physics-informed
and data-driven approach for tunnelling-induced soil-pile interactions. The
proposed approach shows great potential for real-time monitoring and safety
assessment of pile foundations, and benefits for intelligent early-warning
systems in geotechnical engineering.

Motivation: 由于数字数据库的快速增长，自动化文档分类成为NLP热门话题。但针对特定分类任务训练好的模型在其他数据集上可能表现不佳，需要训练和评估多个模型来优化结果。数字干预领域相对较新，利用NLP技术有广阔应用前景。

Conclusion: 通过比较多种ML算法在数字发展干预文档分类中的表现，证明了One vs Rest组合模型方法的有效性，并强调了类内相似性和类间差异性在文档分类任务中的重要性。

Abstract: Automated document classification is a trending topic in Natural Language
Processing (NLP) due to the extensive growth in digital databases. However, a
model that fits well for a specific classification task might perform weakly
for another dataset due to differences in the context. Thus, training and
evaluating several models is necessary to optimise the results. This study
employs a publicly available document database on worldwide digital development
interventions categorised under twelve areas. Since digital interventions are
still emerging, utilising NLP in the field is relatively new. Given the
exponential growth of digital interventions, this research has a vast scope for
improving how digital-development-oriented organisations report their work. The
paper examines the classification performance of Machine Learning (ML)
algorithms, including Decision Trees, k-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector
Machine, AdaBoost, Stochastic Gradient Descent, Naive Bayes, and Logistic
Regression. Accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score are utilised to evaluate
the performance of these models, while oversampling is used to address the
class-imbalanced nature of the dataset. Deviating from the traditional approach
of fitting a single model for multiclass classification, this paper
investigates the One vs Rest approach to build a combined model that optimises
the performance. The study concludes that the amount of data is not the sole
factor affecting the performance; features like similarity within classes and
dissimilarity among classes are also crucial.

Abstract: We introduce DeepFHT, a survival-analysis framework that couples deep neural
networks with first hitting time (FHT) distributions from stochastic process
theory. Time to event is represented as the first passage of a latent diffusion
process to an absorbing boundary. A neural network maps input variables to
physically meaningful parameters including initial condition, drift, and
diffusion, within a chosen FHT process such as Brownian motion, both with drift
and driftless. This yields closed-form survival and hazard functions and
captures time-varying risk without assuming proportional-hazards.
  We compare DeepFHT with Cox regression and other existing parametric survival
models, using synthetic and real-world datasets. The method achieves predictive
accuracy on par with state-of-the-art approaches, while maintaining a
physics-based interpretable parameterization that elucidates the relation
between input features and risk. This combination of stochastic process theory
and deep learning provides a principled avenue for modeling survival phenomena
in complex systems.

TL;DR: TD-JEPA是一种基于时序差分学习的潜在预测方法，用于无监督强化学习，能够在潜在空间中训练状态和任务编码器、策略条件多步预测器以及参数化策略，实现测试时对任意奖励函数的零样本优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有潜在预测方法通常局限于单任务学习、单步预测或在线轨迹数据，而时序差分学习能够从离线、无奖励的转移中学习预测长期潜在动态的表示。

Method: 提出TD-JEPA方法，利用基于TD的潜在预测表示进行无监督强化学习，训练显式的状态和任务编码器、策略条件多步预测器以及直接在潜在空间中的参数化策略。

Conclusion: TD-JEPA通过时序差分学习实现了跨多个策略的长期潜在动态预测，为无监督强化学习提供了有效的表示学习方法，在零样本强化学习中表现出色。

Abstract: Latent prediction--where agents learn by predicting their own latents--has
emerged as a powerful paradigm for training general representations in machine
learning. In reinforcement learning (RL), this approach has been explored to
define auxiliary losses for a variety of settings, including reward-based and
unsupervised RL, behavior cloning, and world modeling. While existing methods
are typically limited to single-task learning, one-step prediction, or
on-policy trajectory data, we show that temporal difference (TD) learning
enables learning representations predictive of long-term latent dynamics across
multiple policies from offline, reward-free transitions. Building on this, we
introduce TD-JEPA, which leverages TD-based latent-predictive representations
into unsupervised RL. TD-JEPA trains explicit state and task encoders, a
policy-conditioned multi-step predictor, and a set of parameterized policies
directly in latent space. This enables zero-shot optimization of any reward
function at test time. Theoretically, we show that an idealized variant of
TD-JEPA avoids collapse with proper initialization, and learns encoders that
capture a low-rank factorization of long-term policy dynamics, while the
predictor recovers their successor features in latent space. Empirically,
TD-JEPA matches or outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on locomotion,
navigation, and manipulation tasks across 13 datasets in ExoRL and OGBench,
especially in the challenging setting of zero-shot RL from pixels.

Method: 使用预测作为下游任务，分析时间序列基础模型的零样本能力和微调性能，并与专门的小模型进行比较。

Result: 时间序列基础模型的零样本能力受预训练领域显著影响，在未见过的真实时间序列数据上，微调后的基础模型相比专门小模型没有明显优势，且参数数量和内存占用更大。

Conclusion: 时间序列数据的多样性使得构建有效的基础模型面临挑战，专门的小模型在特定预测任务上可能更优。

Abstract: Foundation Models are designed to serve as versatile embedding machines, with
strong zero shot capabilities and superior generalization performance when
fine-tuned on diverse downstream tasks. While this is largely true for language
and vision foundation models, we argue that the inherent diversity of time
series data makes them less suited for building effective foundation models. We
demonstrate this using forecasting as our downstream task. We show that the
zero-shot capabilities of a time series foundation model are significantly
influenced and tied to the specific domains it has been pretrained on.
Furthermore, when applied to unseen real-world time series data, fine-tuned
foundation models do not consistently yield substantially better results,
relative to their increased parameter count and memory footprint, than smaller,
dedicated models tailored to the specific forecasting task at hand.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) largely rely on the message-passing paradigm,
where nodes iteratively aggregate information from their neighbors. Yet,
standard message passing neural networks (MPNNs) face well-documented
theoretical and practical limitations. Graph positional encoding (PE) has
emerged as a promising direction to address these limitations. The Euler
Characteristic Transform (ECT) is an efficiently computable
geometric-topological invariant that characterizes shapes and graphs. In this
work, we combine the differentiable approximation of the ECT (DECT) and its
local variant ($\ell$-ECT) to propose LEAP, a new end-to-end trainable local
structural PE for graphs. We evaluate our approach on multiple real-world
datasets as well as on a synthetic task designed to test its ability to extract
topological features. Our results underline the potential of LEAP-based
encodings as a powerful component for graph representation learning pipelines.

Conclusion: 优化器的选择是影响LLM遗忘鲁棒性的关键因素，降级优化器策略能有效增强遗忘的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) unlearning aims to surgically remove the influence
of undesired data or knowledge from an existing model while preserving its
utility on unrelated tasks. This paradigm has shown promise in addressing
privacy and safety concerns. However, recent findings reveal that unlearning
effects are often fragile: post-unlearning manipulations such as weight
quantization or fine-tuning can quickly neutralize the intended forgetting.
Prior efforts to improve robustness primarily reformulate unlearning objectives
by explicitly assuming the role of vulnerability sources. In this work, we take
a different perspective by investigating the role of the optimizer, independent
of unlearning objectives and formulations, in shaping unlearning robustness. We
show that the 'grade' of the optimizer, defined by the level of information it
exploits, ranging from zeroth-order (gradient-free) to first-order
(gradient-based) to second-order (Hessian-based), is tightly linked to the
resilience of unlearning. Surprisingly, we find that downgrading the optimizer,
such as using zeroth-order methods or compressed-gradient variants (e.g.,
gradient sign-based optimizers), often leads to stronger robustness. While
these optimizers produce noisier and less precise updates, they encourage
convergence to harder-to-disturb basins in the loss landscape, thereby
resisting post-training perturbations. By connecting zeroth-order methods with
randomized smoothing, we further highlight their natural advantage for robust
unlearning. Motivated by these insights, we propose a hybrid optimizer that
combines first-order and zeroth-order updates, preserving unlearning efficacy
while enhancing robustness. Extensive experiments on the MUSE and WMDP
benchmarks, across multiple LLM unlearning algorithms, validate that our
approach achieves more resilient forgetting without sacrificing unlearning
quality.

Motivation: 现有反馈范式依赖发布新消息，LLM难以可靠集成这些反馈，导致改进不一致。需要更有效的机制来指导LLM在复杂推理任务中的表现。

Method: 引入原位反馈交互范式，用户直接编辑LLM的先前响应，模型基于这个修改后的响应生成修订版本。

Result: 在多样化推理密集型基准测试中，原位反馈比传统多轮反馈性能更好，同时使用token减少79.1%。控制环境分析显示原位反馈解决了多轮反馈的核心限制。

Conclusion: 原位反馈为在推理密集型任务中指导LLM提供了更自然有效的机制，能够精确应用反馈到错误部分，避免引入新错误。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly studied in the context of
multi-turn reasoning, where models iteratively refine their outputs based on
user-provided feedback. Such settings are crucial for tasks that require
complex reasoning, yet existing feedback paradigms often rely on issuing new
messages. LLMs struggle to integrate these reliably, leading to inconsistent
improvements. In this work, we introduce in-place feedback, a novel interaction
paradigm in which users directly edit an LLM's previous response, and the model
conditions on this modified response to generate its revision. Empirical
evaluations on diverse reasoning-intensive benchmarks reveal that in-place
feedback achieves better performance than conventional multi-turn feedback
while using $79.1\%$ fewer tokens. Complementary analyses on controlled
environments further demonstrate that in-place feedback resolves a core
limitation of multi-turn feedback: models often fail to apply feedback
precisely to erroneous parts of the response, leaving errors uncorrected and
sometimes introducing new mistakes into previously correct content. These
findings suggest that in-place feedback offers a more natural and effective
mechanism for guiding LLMs in reasoning-intensive tasks.

Method: 提供设计选择和实现，通过系统无关的约束表达用户感兴趣区域，在样本高效的方式下最大化约束区域内的模式多样性。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了复杂系统探索中的挑战，通过约束表达用户期望，实现了约束多样性的最大化，为科学和艺术应用提供了有效的探索工具。

Abstract: The diversity of patterns that emerge from complex systems motivates their
use for scientific or artistic purposes. When exploring these systems, the
challenges faced are the size of the parameter space and the strongly
non-linear mapping between parameters and emerging patterns. In addition,
artists and scientists who explore complex systems do so with an expectation of
particular patterns. Taking these expectations into account adds a new set of
challenges, which the exploration process must address. We provide design
choices and their implementation to address these challenges; enabling the
maximization of the diversity of patterns discovered in the user's region of
interest -- which we call the constrained diversity -- in a sample-efficient
manner. The region of interest is expressed in the form of explicit
constraints. These constraints are formulated by the user in a system-agnostic
way, and their addition enables interactive system exploration leading to
constrained diversity, while maintaining global diversity.

Result: EVO-LRP在可解释性指标性能和视觉一致性方面优于传统XAI方法，对类别特定特征具有强敏感性。

Conclusion: 归因质量可以通过原则性、任务特定的优化系统性地改进。

Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) methods help identify which image regions influence a
model's prediction, but often face a trade-off between detail and
interpretability. Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) offers a model-aware
alternative. However, LRP implementations commonly rely on heuristic rule sets
that are not optimized for clarity or alignment with model behavior. We
introduce EVO-LRP, a method that applies Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution
Strategy (CMA-ES) to tune LRP hyperparameters based on quantitative
interpretability metrics, such as faithfulness or sparseness. EVO-LRP
outperforms traditional XAI approaches in both interpretability metric
performance and visual coherence, with strong sensitivity to class-specific
features. These findings demonstrate that attribution quality can be
systematically improved through principled, task-specific optimization.

Method: 提出两阶段算法：首先进行子空间估计识别低维结构，然后在估计子空间导出的紧凑维度表示中使用线性bandit算法。

Result: 算法在任意时间范围T上实现了$\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$的累积遗憾，实证结果表明在累积遗憾和运行时间上都显著优于线性bandit基线。

Conclusion: 该研究建立了社交媒体平台算法干预与多臂bandit理论之间的关键联系，为不完全信息下的意见动态管理提供了有效的在线学习方法。

Abstract: We study the problem of minimizing polarization and disagreement in the
Friedkin-Johnsen opinion dynamics model under incomplete information. Unlike
prior work that assumes a static setting with full knowledge of users' innate
opinions, we address the more realistic online setting where innate opinions
are unknown and must be learned through sequential observations. This novel
setting, which naturally mirrors periodic interventions on social media
platforms, is formulated as a regret minimization problem, establishing a key
connection between algorithmic interventions on social media platforms and
theory of multi-armed bandits. In our formulation, a learner observes only a
scalar feedback of the overall polarization and disagreement after an
intervention. For this novel bandit problem, we propose a two-stage algorithm
based on low-rank matrix bandits. The algorithm first performs subspace
estimation to identify an underlying low-dimensional structure, and then
employs a linear bandit algorithm within the compact dimensional representation
derived from the estimated subspace. We prove that our algorithm achieves an $
\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{T}) $ cumulative regret over any time horizon $T$.
Empirical results validate that our algorithm significantly outperforms a
linear bandit baseline in terms of both cumulative regret and running time.

Conclusion: 所提出的方法通过动态平衡探索和奖励驱动引导，增强了利用能力而不牺牲多样性，有效解决了GFlowNets在大型稀疏搜索空间中的采样挑战。

Abstract: Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) have emerged as a powerful tool for
generating diverse and high-reward structured objects by learning to sample
from a distribution proportional to a given reward function. Unlike
conventional reinforcement learning (RL) approaches that prioritize
optimization of a single trajectory, GFlowNets seek to balance diversity and
reward by modeling the entire trajectory distribution. This capability makes
them especially suitable for domains such as molecular design and combinatorial
optimization. However, existing GFlowNets sampling strategies tend to
overexplore and struggle to consistently generate high-reward samples,
particularly in large search spaces with sparse high-reward regions. Therefore,
improving the probability of generating high-reward samples without sacrificing
diversity remains a key challenge under this premise. In this work, we
integrate an enhanced Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) into the GFlowNets
sampling process, using MCTS-based policy evaluation to guide the generation
toward high-reward trajectories and Polynomial Upper Confidence Trees (PUCT) to
balance exploration and exploitation adaptively, and we introduce a
controllable mechanism to regulate the degree of greediness. Our method
enhances exploitation without sacrificing diversity by dynamically balancing
exploration and reward-driven guidance. The experimental results show that our
method can not only accelerate the speed of discovering high-reward regions but
also continuously generate high-reward samples, while preserving the diversity
of the generative distribution. All implementations are available at

varying degrees of periodic structure, we measure the trade-off between

that, while fine-tuning improves performance on new tasks, it often causes
significant degradation on previously learned ones, illustrating a fundamental

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的分类器自由引导（CFG）使用固定的引导权重ω，虽然能显著提升感知质量，但往往导致分布对齐变差。为了更好逼近目标条件分布，需要动态调整引导权重。

Method: 学习连续函数形式的引导权重ω_{c,(s,t)}，作为条件c、起始时间t和目标时间s的函数。通过最小化真实条件分布与引导扩散过程的分布不匹配来实现，并扩展到奖励引导采样框架。

Result: 在低维玩具示例和高维图像设置中验证了方法的有效性，观察到图像生成的FID指标改进。在文生图应用中，使用CLIP分数作为奖励函数能改善图像-提示对齐。

Conclusion: 动态学习引导权重的方法优于静态CFG，能同时提升感知质量和分布对齐，特别是在文生图任务中能有效改善图像与文本提示的匹配度。

Abstract: Classifier-free guidance (CFG) is a widely used technique for improving the
perceptual quality of samples from conditional diffusion models. It operates by
linearly combining conditional and unconditional score estimates using a
guidance weight $\omega$. While a large, static weight can markedly improve
visual results, this often comes at the cost of poorer distributional
alignment. In order to better approximate the target conditional distribution,
we instead learn guidance weights $\omega_{c,(s,t)}$, which are continuous
functions of the conditioning $c$, the time $t$ from which we denoise, and the
time $s$ towards which we denoise. We achieve this by minimizing the
distributional mismatch between noised samples from the true conditional
distribution and samples from the guided diffusion process. We extend our
framework to reward guided sampling, enabling the model to target distributions
tilted by a reward function $R(x_0,c)$, defined on clean data and a
conditioning $c$. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methodology on
low-dimensional toy examples and high-dimensional image settings, where we
observe improvements in Fr\'echet inception distance (FID) for image
generation. In text-to-image applications, we observe that employing a reward
function given by the CLIP score leads to guidance weights that improve
image-prompt alignment.

Conclusion: 曲率感知策略优化方法能够可靠地跟踪优化动态并利用二阶信息，为可扩展的后训练开辟了更样本高效的路径

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning, particularly through policy gradient methods, has
played a central role in enabling reasoning capabilities of Large Language
Models. However, the optimization stability of policy gradients in this setting
remains understudied. As a result, existing implementations often resort to
conservative hyperparameter choices to ensure stability, which requires more
training samples and increases computational costs. Hence, developing models
for reliably tracking the underlying optimization dynamics and leveraging them
into training enables more sample-efficient regimes and further unleashes
scalable post-training. We address this gap by formalizing the stochastic
optimization problem of policy gradients with explicit consideration of
second-order geometry. We propose a tractable computational framework that
tracks and leverages curvature information during policy updates. We further
employ this framework to design interventions in the optimization process
through data selection. The resultant algorithm, Curvature-Aware Policy
Optimization (CAPO), identifies samples that contribute to unstable updates and
masks them out. Theoretically, we establish monotonic improvement guarantees
under realistic assumptions. On standard math reasoning benchmarks, we
empirically show that CAPO ensures stable updates under aggressive learning
regimes where baselines catastrophically fail. With minimal intervention
(rejecting fewer than 8% of tokens), CAPO achieves up to 30x improvement in
sample efficiency over standard GRPO for LLM reasoning.

Abstract: We study LLM routing, the problem of selecting the best model for each query
while balancing user satisfaction, model expertise, and inference cost. We
formulate routing as contextual dueling bandits, learning from pairwise
preference feedback rather than absolute scores, thereby yielding
label-efficient and dynamic adaptation. Building on this formulation, we
introduce Category-Calibrated Fine-Tuning (CCFT), a representation-learning
method that derives model embeddings from offline data using contrastive
fine-tuning with categorical weighting. These embeddings enable the practical
instantiation of Feel-Good Thompson Sampling for Contextual Dueling Bandits
(FGTS.CDB), a theoretically grounded posterior-sampling algorithm. We propose
four variants of the categorical weighting that explicitly integrate model
quality and cost, and we empirically evaluate the proposed methods on the
RouterBench and MixInstruct datasets. Across both benchmarks, our methods
achieve lower cumulative regret and faster convergence, with better robustness
and performance-cost balance than strong baselines built with a general-purpose
OpenAI embedding model.

Method: 将可解释性方法视为统计估计器，对EAP-IG电路发现方法进行系统性稳定性分析，通过输入重采样、提示改写、超参数变化和因果分析中的注入噪声等受控扰动来评估其方差和鲁棒性。

Result: 在多种模型和任务上的结果表明，EAP-IG表现出高结构方差和对超参数的敏感性，这对其发现的稳定性提出了质疑。

Conclusion: 基于分析结果，提出了报告稳定性指标的最佳实践建议，以促进更严谨和统计基础的可解释性科学。

Abstract: The development of trustworthy artificial intelligence requires moving beyond
black-box performance metrics toward an understanding of models' internal
computations. Mechanistic Interpretability (MI) aims to meet this need by
identifying the algorithmic mechanisms underlying model behaviors. Yet, the
scientific rigor of MI critically depends on the reliability of its findings.
In this work, we argue that interpretability methods, such as circuit
discovery, should be viewed as statistical estimators, subject to questions of
variance and robustness. To illustrate this statistical framing, we present a
systematic stability analysis of a state-of-the-art circuit discovery method:
EAP-IG. We evaluate its variance and robustness through a comprehensive suite
of controlled perturbations, including input resampling, prompt paraphrasing,
hyperparameter variation, and injected noise within the causal analysis itself.
Across a diverse set of models and tasks, our results demonstrate that EAP-IG
exhibits high structural variance and sensitivity to hyperparameters,
questioning the stability of its findings. Based on these results, we offer a
set of best-practice recommendations for the field, advocating for the routine
reporting of stability metrics to promote a more rigorous and statistically
grounded science of interpretability.

*Tanay Rastogi,Daniel Jonsson,Anders Karlström*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种使用Wasserstein生成对抗网络(WGAN)在缺失数据上训练的人口合成模型，通过掩码矩阵处理缺失值，能够在信息不完整的微观样本上有效学习。


<details>

Motivation: 解决由于隐私问题或数据收集限制导致的微观样本中一个或多个属性信息缺失的挑战。

Method: 使用掩码矩阵表示缺失值，提出WGAN训练算法，让模型能够从包含缺失信息的训练数据集中学习。

Result: 实验使用瑞典国家旅行调查数据验证，生成的合成人口与完整数据训练的模型以及实际人口数据集高度相似。

Conclusion: 该方法为不完整数据的人口合成提供了稳健解决方案，展示了深度生成模型在推进人口合成能力方面的潜力。

Abstract: This paper presents a population synthesis model that utilizes the
Wasserstein Generative-Adversarial Network (WGAN) for training on incomplete
microsamples. By using a mask matrix to represent missing values, the study
proposes a WGAN training algorithm that lets the model learn from a training
dataset that has some missing information. The proposed method aims to address
the challenge of missing information in microsamples on one or more attributes
due to privacy concerns or data collection constraints. The paper contrasts
WGAN models trained on incomplete microsamples with those trained on complete
microsamples, creating a synthetic population. We conducted a series of
evaluations of the proposed method using a Swedish national travel survey. We
validate the efficacy of the proposed method by generating synthetic
populations from all the models and comparing them to the actual population
dataset. The results from the experiments showed that the proposed methodology
successfully generates synthetic data that closely resembles a model trained
with complete data as well as the actual population. The paper contributes to
the field by providing a robust solution for population synthesis with
incomplete data, opening avenues for future research, and highlighting the
potential of deep generative models in advancing population synthesis
capabilities.

*Thiziri Nait Saada,Louis Bethune,Michal Klein,David Grangier,Marco Cuturi,Pierre Ablin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文深入分析了基于分类器的质量过滤方法(CQF)，发现虽然CQF能提升下游任务性能，但并未改善高质量数据集上的语言建模能力，因为CQF也会隐式过滤高质量数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模模型在包含混合质量文档的网络爬取数据集上预训练，数据过滤至关重要。CQF方法通过训练二元分类器来区分预训练数据和小型高质量数据集，但需要深入分析其有效性。

Method: 使用CQF方法为预训练文档分配质量分数，仅保留得分最高的文档。同时与通过随机标记排列生成的合成数据进行比较。

Result: CQF提高了下游任务性能，但未增强高质量数据集上的语言建模能力。与合成数据相比，CQF表现出截然不同的趋势。

Conclusion: CQF并不一定捕捉到有意义的数据质量概念，挑战了当前对CQF有效性的看法。

Abstract: Large-scale models are pretrained on massive web-crawled datasets containing
documents of mixed quality, making data filtering essential. A popular method
is Classifier-based Quality Filtering (CQF), which trains a binary classifier
to distinguish between pretraining data and a small, high-quality set. It
assigns each pretraining document a quality score defined as the classifier's
score and retains only the top-scoring ones. We provide an in-depth analysis of
CQF. We show that while CQF improves downstream task performance, it does not
necessarily enhance language modeling on the high-quality dataset. We explain
this paradox by the fact that CQF implicitly filters the high-quality dataset
as well. We further compare the behavior of models trained with CQF to those
trained on synthetic data of increasing quality, obtained via random token
permutations, and find starkly different trends. Our results challenge the view
that CQF captures a meaningful notion of data quality.

### [235] [Target Population Synthesis using CT-GAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00871)
*Tanay Rastogi,Daniel Jonsson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了使用条件表格生成对抗网络(CT-GAN)来生成目标人口，并与传统FBS-CO方法进行比较。结果显示单独使用CT-GAN表现最佳，能够生成符合单变量分布的逼真群体，但在保持多变量关系方面存在困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统确定性人口合成方法在处理高维数据、可扩展性和零单元问题方面面临挑战，特别是在为目标场景生成人口时。

Method: 使用CT-GAN直接根据边际约束生成目标人口，或通过混合方法将CT-GAN与基于适应度的合成组合优化(FBS-CO)相结合。

Result: 独立CT-GAN模型表现最佳，能够生成符合单变量分布的逼真群体，但在多变量关系保持方面存在困难。混合模型相比FBS-CO有所改进。

Conclusion: CT-GAN是生成目标人口的有效方法，深度生成模型可以与传统的合成技术成功集成以提升性能。

Abstract: Agent-based models used in scenario planning for transportation and urban
planning usually require detailed population information from the base as well
as target scenarios. These populations are usually provided by synthesizing
fake agents through deterministic population synthesis methods. However, these
deterministic population synthesis methods face several challenges, such as
handling high-dimensional data, scalability, and zero-cell issues, particularly
when generating populations for target scenarios. This research looks into how
a deep generative model called Conditional Tabular Generative Adversarial
Network (CT-GAN) can be used to create target populations either directly from
a collection of marginal constraints or through a hybrid method that combines
CT-GAN with Fitness-based Synthesis Combinatorial Optimization (FBS-CO). The
research evaluates the proposed population synthesis models against travel
survey and zonal-level aggregated population data. Results indicate that the
stand-alone CT-GAN model performs the best when compared with FBS-CO and the
hybrid model. CT-GAN by itself can create realistic-looking groups that match
single-variable distributions, but it struggles to maintain relationships
between multiple variables. However, the hybrid model demonstrates improved
performance compared to FBS-CO by leveraging CT-GAN ability to generate a
descriptive base population, which is then refined using FBS-CO to align with
target-year marginals. This study demonstrates that CT-GAN represents an
effective methodology for target populations and highlights how deep generative
models can be successfully integrated with conventional synthesis techniques to
enhance their performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 区域供热网络中的传感器和计量数据通常存在噪声、缺失值和时间不一致性，这会显著降低AI模型的性能，因此需要有效的数据质量评估方法。

Method: 使用Python可视化技术构建交互式仪表板，包括时间序列图、热力图、箱线图、直方图、相关矩阵以及基于修正z分数的异常检测等工具，实现人工专家参与的数据质量评估。

Conclusion: 可视化数据分析为数据清洗策略提供指导，可提高长短期记忆和门控循环单元模型在热需求预测中的准确性、稳定性和泛化能力，为AI驱动的能源管理系统构建了可扩展的数据质量评估框架。

Abstract: High-quality data is a prerequisite for training reliable Artificial
Intelligence (AI) models in the energy domain. In district heating networks,
sensor and metering data often suffer from noise, missing values, and temporal
inconsistencies, which can significantly degrade model performance. This paper
presents a systematic approach for evaluating and improving data quality using
visual diagnostics, implemented through an interactive web-based dashboard. The
dashboard employs Python-based visualization techniques, including time series
plots, heatmaps, box plots, histograms, correlation matrices, and
anomaly-sensitive KPIs such as skewness and anomaly detection based on the
modified z-scores. These tools al-low human experts to inspect and interpret
data anomalies, enabling a human-in-the-loop strategy for data quality
assessment. The methodology is demonstrated on a real-world dataset from a
Danish district heating provider, covering over four years of hourly data from
nearly 7000 meters. The findings show how visual analytics can uncover systemic
data issues and, in the future, guide data cleaning strategies that enhance the
accuracy, stability, and generalizability of Long Short-Term Memory and Gated
Recurrent Unit models for heat demand forecasting. The study contributes to a
scalable, generalizable framework for visual data inspection and underlines the
critical role of data quality in AI-driven energy management systems.

*Jose I. Mestre,Alberto Fernández-Hernández,Cristian Pérez-Corral,Manuel F. Dolz,Jose Duato,Enrique S. Quintana-Ortí*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GreenLightningAI (GLAI) 是一种新的架构模块，通过分离结构知识和定量知识来替代传统MLP，实现更高效的训练过程，平均减少40%训练时间，同时保持或超越MLP的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MLP在训练过程中将结构知识和定量知识纠缠在一起，导致训练效率不高。GLAI旨在分离这两种知识，通过固定稳定的激活模式结构，只优化数值权重和偏置，从而提高训练效率。

Method: GLAI将MLP重新表述为路径的组合，一旦激活模式稳定就固定结构，只优化定量组件。该方法保留了MLP的通用逼近能力，但实现了更高效的训练过程。

Result: 在多种实验设置中，GLAI平均减少训练时间约40%，同时在使用相同参数数量的情况下，准确率与MLP相当或更高，且收敛速度更快。

Conclusion: GLAI确立了一个新的设计原则，可以作为通用模块替代MLP，为未来集成到大规模架构（如Transformer）中开辟了新方向，其中MLP块占据了主要计算开销。

Abstract: In this work we introduce GreenLightningAI (GLAI), a new architectural block
designed as an alternative to conventional MLPs. The central idea is to
separate two types of knowledge that are usually entangled during training: (i)
*structural knowledge*, encoded by the stable activation patterns induced by
ReLU activations; and (ii) *quantitative knowledge*, carried by the numerical
weights and biases. By fixing the structure once stabilized, GLAI reformulates
the MLP as a combination of paths, where only the quantitative component is
optimized. This reformulation retains the universal approximation capabilities
of MLPs, yet achieves a more efficient training process, reducing training time
by ~40% on average across the cases examined in this study. Crucially, GLAI is
not just another classifier, but a generic block that can replace MLPs wherever
they are used, from supervised heads with frozen backbones to projection layers
in self-supervised learning or few-shot classifiers. Across diverse
experimental setups, GLAI consistently matches or exceeds the accuracy of MLPs
with an equivalent number of parameters, while converging faster. Overall, GLAI
establishes a new design principle that opens a direction for future
integration into large-scale architectures such as Transformers, where MLP
blocks dominate the computational footprint.

Motivation: 研究不同损失函数对强化学习价值函数方法的影响，探索更优的预测目标以改善策略性能。

Method: 理论分析不同预测目标（平均绝对误差vs均方误差）与损失函数的匹配关系，并在线性强化学习中进行实证验证。

Result: 理论证明平均绝对误差能更好地控制策略次优性差距，实证显示基于交叉熵损失的算法在线性强化学习中优于基于平方损失的算法。

Conclusion: 损失函数选择对强化学习性能有重要影响，交叉熵损失与平均绝对误差的组合能产生更好的策略性能。

Abstract: This paper investigates the impact of the loss function in value-based
methods for reinforcement learning through an analysis of underlying prediction
objectives. We theoretically show that mean absolute error is a better
prediction objective than the traditional mean squared error for controlling
the learned policy's suboptimality gap. Furthermore, we present results that
different loss functions are better aligned with these different regression
objectives: binary and categorical cross-entropy losses with the mean absolute
error and squared loss with the mean squared error. We then provide empirical
evidence that algorithms minimizing these cross-entropy losses can outperform
those based on the squared loss in linear reinforcement learning.

Motivation: 基因表达数据特征选择对提升分类性能和降低计算成本至关重要，需要有效整合不同特征选择方法的优势。

Method: 提出BoMGene混合方法，结合Boruta和mRMR两种流行技术，在25个基因表达数据集上使用SVM、随机森林、XGBoost和GBM分类器进行实验。

Result: Boruta-mRMR组合比单独使用mRMR减少了所选特征数量，加快了训练时间，同时保持甚至提高了分类准确率。

Conclusion: 该方法在准确性、稳定性和实际应用性方面对多类基因表达数据分析具有明显优势。

Abstract: Feature selection is a crucial step in analyzing gene expression data,
enhancing classification performance, and reducing computational costs for
high-dimensional datasets. This paper proposes BoMGene, a hybrid feature
selection method that effectively integrates two popular techniques: Boruta and
Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (mRMR). The method aims to optimize the
feature space and enhance classification accuracy. Experiments were conducted
on 25 publicly available gene expression datasets, employing widely used
classifiers such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, XGBoost (XGB),
and Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM). The results show that using the
Boruta-mRMR combination cuts down the number of features chosen compared to
just using mRMR, which helps to speed up training time while keeping or even
improving classification accuracy compared to using individual feature
selection methods. The proposed approach demonstrates clear advantages in
accuracy, stability, and practical applicability for multi-class gene
expression data analysis

TL;DR: RiskPO是一种基于风险度量的强化学习方法，通过混合风险价值目标增强对困难样本的梯度信号，防止熵崩溃，在数学推理、多模态推理和代码生成任务上显著优于GRPO方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于均值的强化学习方法（如GRPO）存在熵崩溃和推理能力提升有限的问题，原因是过度关注高概率输出序列而忽略了稀有但信息丰富的推理路径。

Method: 提出RiskPO方法，用原则性风险度量替代经典均值目标，引入混合风险价值目标整合奖励分布的多个区域，并设计捆绑方案将多个问题聚合以丰富反馈信号。

Result: 在数学推理、多模态推理和代码生成基准测试中，RiskPO在Pass@1和Pass@k指标上均显著优于GRPO及其变体，实现了持续且显著的改进。

Conclusion: 基于风险的优化为增强LLM推理能力提供了严谨有效的范式，理论证明风险规避更新能缓解熵崩溃并促进探索。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable reward has recently emerged as a
central paradigm for post-training large language models (LLMs); however,
prevailing mean-based methods, such as Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO), suffer from entropy collapse and limited reasoning gains. We argue that
these issues stem from overemphasizing high-probability output sequences while
neglecting rare but informative reasoning paths. To address these challenges,
we propose Risk-based Policy Optimization (RiskPO), which substitutes classical
mean-based objectives with principled risk measures. Specifically, we introduce
a Mixed Value-at-Risk objective that integrates weighted attention over
multiple regions of the reward distribution, thereby amplifying gradient
signals on challenging instances and preventing overconfident convergence. We
further design a bundling scheme that aggregates multiple questions into
bundles, thus enriching the feedback signal and yielding more stable and
informative training dynamics. Theoretically, we prove that the risk-averse
update alleviates entropy collapse and promotes exploration. Numerically,
RiskPO achieves consistent and significant improvements in mathematical
reasoning, multi-modal reasoning, and code generation benchmarks, surpassing
GRPO and its variants on both Pass@1 and Pass@k metrics. Our results
demonstrate that risk-based optimization provides a rigorous and effective
paradigm for enhancing LLM reasoning capabilities.

TL;DR: RLVR使用可验证奖励训练策略以避免人工标注成本，但二元奖励会引入假阴性和假阳性错误。论文提出两种校正算法来纠正验证器错误，在数学推理任务中表现优于未校正方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR系统使用二元奖励训练策略，但验证器不可靠会导致假阴性（拒绝正确答案）和假阳性（接受错误答案）问题，影响训练效果。

Method: 将验证器建模为具有不对称噪声率的随机奖励通道，提出向后校正（去偏观测奖励）和向前校正（重加权得分函数项）两种算法，在GRPO-based RLVR流程中实现。

Result: 在数学推理模型和基准测试中，两种校正方法均优于未校正训练；向前校正收敛更快且在更严重噪声下保持稳定。轻量级LLM验证器通过重新检查规则基础的假阴性在线估计FN率，表现优于其他先进方法。

Conclusion: 验证器错误校正算法能有效提升RLVR训练效果，向前校正具有更好的收敛性和稳定性，在线FN率估计机制具有实用价值。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) trains policies against
automated verifiers to avoid costly human labeling. To reduce vulnerability to
verifier hacking, many RLVR systems collapse rewards to binary $\{0,1\}$ during
training. This choice carries a cost: it introduces \textit{false negatives}
(rejecting correct answers, FNs) and \textit{false positives} (accepting
incorrect ones, FPs). For instance, a rule-based checker may mark the correct
fraction $\frac{12}{36}$ as wrong when compared against the canonical
$\frac{1}{3}$ due to brittle parsing/equivalence rules (FN), while a large
language model (LLM) judges can be gamed by superficial cues or even a single
adversarial token, yielding inflated correctness for wrong solutions (FP). We
formalize verifier unreliability by modeling the verifier as a stochastic
reward channel with asymmetric noise rates. From this abstraction, we derive
two correction algorithms for verifier errors. The first is a \textit{backward}
correction that de-biases the observed binary reward to recover an
\textit{unbiased} estimator of the clean policy gradient. The second is a
\textit{forward} correction that reweights score-function terms so that the
expected update direction aligns with the \textit{clean gradient}; notably, it
requires only the FN rate. We implement both as lightweight hooks in a group
relative policy optimization (GRPO)-based RLVR pipeline and evaluate them on
math-reasoning models and benchmarks. Across models and datasets, both
corrections improve over uncorrected training; the forward variant converges
faster and remains stable under heavier noise. Finally, we show a practical
appeal mechanism in which a lightweight LLM verifier estimates the FN rate
online by rechecking rule-based negatives, obtaining outperformance compared
with other state-of-the-art contenders.

TL;DR: RECAP是一种通过对抗性思维预填充来增强大型推理模型安全对齐的强化学习方法，能够在保持推理能力的同时显著提升安全性和抗攻击能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型在生成思维链时缺乏对安全对齐的批判性推理能力，容易受到有缺陷前提的误导，需要一种方法来教会模型覆盖错误的推理轨迹并转向安全响应。

Method: 使用基于强化学习的后训练方法，在标准提示的基础上混合合成生成的对齐思维链预填充，无需额外的训练成本或对标准RLHF的修改。

Result: 显著提高了安全性和越狱鲁棒性，减少了过度拒绝，同时保持了核心推理能力，且在推理时不会增加token预算。模型更频繁地进行自我反思，在自适应攻击下保持稳健。

Conclusion: RECAP方法有效解决了大型推理模型在安全对齐方面的脆弱性，提供了一种实用且高效的安全增强方案。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) "think" by generating structured
chain-of-thought (CoT) before producing a final answer, yet they still lack the
ability to reason critically about safety alignment and are easily biased when
a flawed premise is injected into their thought process. We propose RECAP
(Robust Safety Alignment via Counter-Aligned Prefilling), a principled
reinforcement learning (RL) method for post-training that explicitly teaches
models to override flawed reasoning trajectories and reroute to safe and
helpful responses. RECAP trains on a mixture of synthetically generated
counter-aligned CoT prefills and standard prompts, requires no additional
training cost or modifications beyond vanilla reinforcement learning from human
feedback (RLHF), and substantially improves safety and jailbreak robustness,
reduces overrefusal, and preserves core reasoning capability -- all while
maintaining inference token budget. Extensive analysis shows that RECAP-trained
models engage in self-reflection more frequently and remain robust under
adaptive attacks, preserving safety even after repeated attempts to override
their reasoning.

Motivation: 挑战GRPO需要大组规模的假设，通过将其重新框架为对比学习来揭示与DPO的基本联系，探索最小配置(2-GRPO)的可行性以减少计算开销。

Method: 将GRPO重新框架为对比学习形式，建立与DPO的理论联系，提供2-GRPO的严格理论分析，并进行实证验证。

Result: 2-GRPO在性能上与16-GRPO相当，但仅使用1/8的rollout，训练时间减少超过70%。

Conclusion: GRPO不一定需要大组规模，2-GRPO是可行的高效替代方案，显著降低了计算成本。

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) is a prominent reinforcement
learning algorithm for post-training Large Language Models (LLMs). It is
commonly believed that GRPO necessitates a large group size to ensure stable
training via precise statistical estimation, which incurs substantial
computational overhead. In this work, we challenge this assumption by reframing
GRPO as a form of contrastive learning, which reveals a fundamental connection
to Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Motivated by DPO's empirical success,
we investigate the minimal two-rollout case (2-GRPO), a configuration
previously deemed infeasible. We provide a rigorous theoretical analysis to
validate 2-GRPO and demonstrate empirically that it achieves performance on par
with 16-GRPO, despite using only 1/8 of the rollouts and reducing training time
by over 70%.

Abstract: Consistency models are a class of generative models that enable few-step
generation for diffusion and flow matching models. While consistency models
have achieved promising results on Euclidean domains like images, their
applications to Riemannian manifolds remain challenging due to the curved
geometry. In this work, we propose the Riemannian Consistency Model (RCM),
which, for the first time, enables few-step consistency modeling while
respecting the intrinsic manifold constraint imposed by the Riemannian
geometry. Leveraging the covariant derivative and exponential-map-based
parameterization, we derive the closed-form solutions for both discrete- and
continuous-time training objectives for RCM. We then demonstrate theoretical
equivalence between the two variants of RCM: Riemannian consistency
distillation (RCD) that relies on a teacher model to approximate the marginal
vector field, and Riemannian consistency training (RCT) that utilizes the
conditional vector field for training. We further propose a simplified training
objective that eliminates the need for the complicated differential
calculation. Finally, we provide a unique kinematics perspective for
interpreting the RCM objective, offering new theoretical angles. Through
extensive experiments, we manifest the superior generative quality of RCM in
few-step generation on various non-Euclidean manifolds, including flat-tori,
spheres, and the 3D rotation group SO(3).

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) as Machine Learning (ML) models have recently
received a lot of attention as a potentially more energy-efficient alternative
to conventional Artificial Neural Networks. The non-differentiability and
sparsity of the spiking mechanism can make these models very difficult to train
with algorithms based on propagating gradients through the spiking
non-linearity. We address this problem by adapting the paradigm of Random
Feature Methods (RFMs) from Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to Spike Response
Model (SRM) SNNs. This approach allows training of SNNs without approximation
of the spike function gradient. Concretely, we propose a novel data-driven,
fast, high-performance, and interpretable algorithm for end-to-end training of
SNNs inspired by the SWIM algorithm for RFM-ANNs, which we coin S-SWIM. We
provide a thorough theoretical discussion and supplementary numerical
experiments showing that S-SWIM can reach high accuracies on time series
forecasting as a standalone strategy and serve as an effective initialisation
strategy before gradient-based training. Additional ablation studies show that
our proposed method performs better than random sampling of network weights.

TL;DR: 提出了一种序列化医疗测试算法，在保证分类错误率不超过预设阈值的前提下，最小化昂贵的诊断测试次数，相比已知真实参数和特征分布的oracle基准仅需O(√T)的额外测试。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在医疗筛查等成本敏感场景中，如何在保证分类准确率的同时最小化昂贵的诊断测试次数的问题。患者特征与疾病风险之间存在未知的逻辑回归关系，需要在测试成本与分类错误之间进行权衡。

Method: 开发了一种新颖算法，交替进行标签收集和分布估计，同时估计逻辑回归参数θ*和上下文分布P，并计算保守的数据驱动阈值τ_t来决定何时需要进行测试。

Result: 理论证明该算法以至少1-δ的概率不超过目标误分类率，且相比知道真实参数和患者特征分布的oracle基准仅需O(√T)的额外测试。仿真实验验证了理论保证，表明算法能有效估计θ*同时保持安全性。

Conclusion: 建立了误差约束逻辑测试的第一个无遗憾保证，可直接应用于成本敏感的医疗筛查场景，在保证安全性的同时高效减少测试成本。

Abstract: We study the problem of sequentially testing individuals for a binary disease
outcome whose true risk is governed by an unknown logistic model. At each
round, a patient arrives with feature vector $x_t$, and the decision maker may
either pay to administer a (noiseless) diagnostic test--revealing the true
label--or skip testing and predict the patient's disease status based on their
feature vector and prior history. Our goal is to minimize the total number of
costly tests required while guaranteeing that the fraction of
misclassifications does not exceed a prespecified error tolerance $\alpha$,
with probability at least $1-\delta$. To address this, we develop a novel
algorithm that interleaves label-collection and distribution estimation to
estimate both $\theta^{*}$ and the context distribution $P$, and computes a
conservative, data-driven threshold $\tau_t$ on the logistic score
$|x_t^\top\theta|$ to decide when testing is necessary. We prove that, with
probability at least $1-\delta$, our procedure does not exceed the target
misclassification rate, and requires only $O(\sqrt{T})$ excess tests compared
to the oracle baseline that knows both $\theta^{*}$ and the patient feature
distribution $P$. This establishes the first no-regret guarantees for
error-constrained logistic testing, with direct applications to cost-sensitive
medical screening. Simulations corroborate our theoretical guarantees, showing
that in practice our procedure efficiently estimates $\theta^{*}$ while
retaining safety guarantees, and does not require too many excess tests.

TL;DR: 本文分析了在查询提示前插入无意义标记能提升LLM推理性能的现象，提出了激活重分布模块(ARM)来模拟这种效果，无需修改输入序列即可改善模型表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究观察到在查询提示前插入长序列无意义标记能持续提升LLM推理性能，这一现象令人困惑，需要深入理解其机制并开发更原则性的方法。

Method: 提出激活重分布模块(ARM)，这是一种轻量级推理时技术，通过识别非线性函数后的近零激活并将其向外移动，以受控方式重现无意义标记的有益效果。

Result: 在多种基准测试和模型架构上的广泛实验表明，ARM能持续提升LLM在推理任务上的性能，且只需几行简单代码即可实现。

Conclusion: 研究不仅清晰解释了无意义标记带来意外益处的机制，还提供了一种简单有效的技术，利用激活重分布来进一步提升LLM性能。

Abstract: Motivated by the puzzling observation that inserting long sequences of
meaningless tokens before the query prompt can consistently enhance LLM
reasoning performance, this work analyzes the underlying mechanism driving this
phenomenon and based on these insights proposes a more principled method that
allows for similar performance gains. First, we find that the improvements
arise from a redistribution of activations in the LLM's MLP layers, where near
zero activations become less frequent while large magnitude activations
increase. This redistribution enhances the model's representational capacity by
suppressing weak signals and promoting stronger, more informative ones.
Building on this insight, we propose the Activation Redistribution Module
(ARM), a lightweight inference-time technique that modifies activations
directly without altering the input sequence. ARM adaptively identifies
near-zero activations after the non-linear function and shifts them outward,
implicitly reproducing the beneficial effects of meaningless tokens in a
controlled manner. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks and model
architectures clearly show that ARM consistently improves LLM performance on
reasoning tasks while requiring only a few lines of simple code to implement.
Our findings deliver both a clear mechanistic explanation for the unexpected
benefits of meaningless tokens and a simple yet effective technique that
harnesses activation redistribution to further improve LLM performance.

Motivation: 现有课程学习方法未能充分考虑提示难度变化，依赖简单过滤机制选择窄范围标准的数据集，导致显著计算浪费。

Result: CurES在1.5B和7B模型上分别比GRPO提升3.30和4.82分，且收敛速度更快。

Conclusion: 提示采样分布决定梯度下降收敛速率，rollout数量分配影响整体梯度更新的稳定性和一致性，CurES方法能有效加速收敛并减少计算开销。

Abstract: Curriculum learning plays a crucial role in enhancing the training efficiency
of large language models (LLMs) on reasoning tasks. However, existing methods
often fail to adequately account for variations in prompt difficulty or rely on
simplistic filtering mechanisms to select prompt datasets within a narrow
criterion range, resulting in significant computational waste. In this work, we
approach the problem from the perspective of reinforcement learning gradient
optimization, offering a systematic and theoretical investigation into how to
improve the training efficiency of LLMs. We identify two key factors
influencing training efficiency: the selection of training prompts and the
allocation of rollout quantities across different prompts. Our theoretical
analysis reveals that the sampling distribution of prompts dictates the
convergence rate of gradient descent, while the allocation of the rollout
quantity influences the consistency and stability of overall gradient updates.
Based on these insights, we propose CurES, an efficient training method that
accelerates convergence and employs Bayesian posterior estimation to minimize
computational overhead. Experiments demonstrate that our CurES outperforms
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) by \textbf{+3.30} points and
\textbf{+4.82} points with 1.5B and 7B models, respectively. Additionally,
CurES exhibits faster convergence compared to baselines, including GRPO.

TL;DR: 提出了Gated X-TFC方法，通过可学习的软域分解解决PINNs在边界层问题中的梯度分辨率问题，显著提高了计算效率和精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统PINNs和相关方法在解决奇异摄动边界值问题时难以解析尖锐梯度，而X-TFC虽然避免了多目标优化，但在边界层问题上计算效率低下且不支持域分解。

Method: 采用可学习的逻辑门进行软域分解，动态调整径向基函数核宽度，无需接口惩罚；引入算子条件元学习层，学习从PDE参数到最优门配置的概率映射。

Result: 在1D对流-扩散基准测试中，Gated X-TFC比标准X-TFC误差降低一个数量级，使用80%更少的配点，训练时间减少66%；在双边界层方程和2D泊松问题中展示了可扩展性。

Conclusion: Gated X-TFC为PINNs提供了一个简单而有效的替代方案，在具有挑战性的边界层区域既准确又计算高效。

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and related methods struggle to
resolve sharp gradients in singularly perturbed boundary value problems without
resorting to some form of domain decomposition, which often introduce complex
interface penalties. While the Extreme Theory of Functional Connections (X-TFC)
avoids multi-objective optimization by employing exact boundary condition
enforcement, it remains computationally inefficient for boundary layers and
incompatible with decomposition. We propose Gated X-TFC, a novel framework for
both forward and inverse problems, that overcomes these limitations through a
soft, learned domain decomposition. Our method replaces hard interfaces with a
differentiable logistic gate that dynamically adapts radial basis function
(RBF) kernel widths across the domain, eliminating the need for interface
penalties. This approach yields not only superior accuracy but also dramatic
improvements in computational efficiency: on a benchmark one dimensional (1D)
convection-diffusion, Gated X-TFC achieves an order-of-magnitude lower error
than standard X-TFC while using 80 percent fewer collocation points and
reducing training time by 66 percent. In addition, we introduce an
operator-conditioned meta-learning layer that learns a probabilistic mapping
from PDE parameters to optimal gate configurations, enabling fast,
uncertainty-aware warm-starting for new problem instances. We further
demonstrate scalability to multiple subdomains and higher dimensions by solving
a twin boundary-layer equation and a 2D Poisson problem with a sharp Gaussian
source. Overall, Gated X-TFC delivers a simple alternative alternative to PINNs
that is both accurate and computationally efficient for challenging
boundar-layer regimes. Future work will focus on nonlinear problems.

Abstract: The training paradigm for large language models (LLMs) is moving from static
datasets to experience-based learning, where agents acquire skills via
interacting with complex environments. To facilitate this transition we
introduce GEM (General Experience Maker), an open-source environment simulator
designed for the age of LLMs. Analogous to OpenAI-Gym for traditional
reinforcement learning (RL), GEM provides a standardized framework for the
environment-agent interface, including asynchronous vectorized execution for
high throughput, and flexible wrappers for easy extensibility. GEM also
features a diverse suite of environments, robust integrated tools, and
single-file example scripts demonstrating using GEM with five popular RL
training frameworks. Along with this, we also provide a set of baselines across
24 environments using REINFORCE with Return Batch Normalization (ReBN), which
-- unlike GRPO -- is compatible with the full RL setting of dense per-turn
rewards and offers better credit assignment. We further conduct apple-to-apple
benchmarking of PPO, GRPO and REINFORCE in both single- and multi-turn settings
using GEM to shed light on the algorithmic designs. Lastly, GEM also functions
as a convenient evaluation toolkit besides a training environment. We hope this
framework can help accelerate future agentic LLM research.

Conclusion: 建立了秘密诱导的公共基准，证明了不同诱导方法在不同场景下的有效性，为AI模型审计提供了重要工具。

Abstract: We study secret elicitation: discovering knowledge that an AI possesses but
does not explicitly verbalize. As a testbed, we train three families of large
language models (LLMs) to possess specific knowledge that they apply downstream
but deny knowing when asked directly. For example, in one setting, we train an
LLM to generate replies that are consistent with knowing the user is female,
while denying this knowledge when asked directly. We then design various
black-box and white-box secret elicitation techniques and evaluate them based
on whether they can help an LLM auditor successfully guess the secret
knowledge. Many of our techniques improve on simple baselines. Our most
effective techniques (performing best in 2/3 settings) are based on prefill
attacks, a black-box technique where the LLM reveals secret knowledge when
generating a completion from a predefined prefix. In our remaining setting,
white-box techniques based on logit lens and sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are
most effective. We release our models and code, establishing a public benchmark
for evaluating secret elicitation methods.

Abstract: Preprint Note: This is the author preprint version of a paper accepted for
presentation at the IISE Annual Conference & Expo 2025. The final version will
appear in the official proceedings.
  Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of blindness in working-age
adults, and current diagnostic methods rely on resource-intensive eye exams and
specialized equipment. Image-based AI tools have shown limitations in
early-stage detection, motivating the need for alternative approaches. We
propose a non-image-based, two-level ensemble model for DR prediction using
routine laboratory test results. In the first stage, base models (Linear SVC,
Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost) are hyperparameter tuned and
internally stacked across different configurations to optimize metrics such as
accuracy, recall, and precision. In the second stage, predictions are
aggregated using Random Forest as a meta-learner. This hierarchical stacking
strategy improves generalization, balances performance across multiple metrics,
and remains computationally efficient compared to deep learning approaches. The
model achieved Accuracy 0.9433, F1 Score 0.9425, Recall 0.9207, Precision
0.9653, ROC-AUC 0.9844, and AUPRC 0.9875, surpassing one-level stacking and FCN
baselines. These results highlight the model potential for accurate and
interpretable DR risk prediction in clinical settings.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has gathered much attention in recent years due to its
rapid development and rich applications, especially on control systems and
robotics. When tackling real-world applications with reinforcement learning
method, the corresponded Markov decision process may have huge discrete or even
continuous state/action space. Deep reinforcement learning has been studied for
handling these issues through deep learning for years, and one promising branch
is the actor-critic architecture. Many past studies leveraged multiple critics
to enhance the accuracy of evaluation of a policy for addressing the
overestimation and underestimation issues. However, few studies have considered
the architecture with multiple actors together with multiple critics. This
study proposes a novel multi-actor multi-critic (MAMC) deep deterministic
reinforcement learning method. The proposed method has three main features,
including selection of actors based on non-dominated sorting for exploration
with respect to skill and creativity factors, evaluation for actors and critics
using a quantile-based ensemble strategy, and exploiting actors with best skill
factor. Theoretical analysis proves the learning stability and bounded
estimation bias for the MAMC. The present study examines the performance on a
well-known reinforcement learning benchmark MuJoCo. Experimental results show
that the proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art deep deterministic
based reinforcement learning methods. Experimental analysis also indicates the
proposed components are effective. Empirical analysis further investigates the
validity of the proposed method, and shows its benefit on complicated problems.

Abstract: Learning stochastic models of dynamical systems underlying observed data is
of interest in many scientific fields. Here we propose a novel method for this
task, based on the framework of variational autoencoders for dynamical systems.
The method estimates from the data both the system state trajectories and noise
time series. This approach allows to perform multi-step system evolution and
supports a teacher forcing strategy, alleviating limitations of
autoencoder-based approaches for stochastic systems. We demonstrate the
performance of the proposed approach on six test problems, covering simulated
and experimental data. We further show the effects of the teacher forcing
interval on the nature of the internal dynamics, and compare it to the
deterministic models with equivalent architecture.

Motivation: 研究神经网络回归中学习表示的几何特性，解释为什么回归任务中的神经坍缩会损害泛化性能，而分类任务中的坍缩却有益。

Method: 通过内在维度分析，比较最后一层特征的内在维度(ID_H)与回归目标的内在维度(ID_Y)，在控制任务和合成数据集上进行实验验证。

Result: 坍缩模型表现出ID_H < ID_Y，导致过度压缩和泛化性能差；非坍缩模型通常保持ID_H > ID_Y。性能与ID_H的关系取决于数据量和噪声水平。

Conclusion: 识别了过度压缩和压缩不足两种机制，提出了通过调整特征维度来提升泛化性能的实用策略，为神经网络回归提供了新的几何视角。

Abstract: Neural multivariate regression underpins a wide range of domains such as
control, robotics, and finance, yet the geometry of its learned representations
remains poorly characterized. While neural collapse has been shown to benefit
generalization in classification, we find that analogous collapse in regression
consistently degrades performance. To explain this contrast, we analyze models
through the lens of intrinsic dimension. Across control tasks and synthetic
datasets, we estimate the intrinsic dimension of last-layer features (ID_H) and
compare it with that of the regression targets (ID_Y). Collapsed models exhibit
ID_H < ID_Y, leading to over-compression and poor generalization, whereas
non-collapsed models typically maintain ID_H > ID_Y. For the non-collapsed
models, performance with respect to ID_H depends on the data quantity and noise
levels. From these observations, we identify two regimes (over-compressed and
under-compressed) that determine when expanding or reducing feature
dimensionality improves performance. Our results provide new geometric insights
into neural regression and suggest practical strategies for enhancing
generalization.

Motivation: 传统时间序列模型缺乏处理非结构化上下文信息、回答领域特定问题和生成自然语言解释的能力，而LLM虽然擅长上下文推理和知识整合，但在处理数值时间序列方面表现不佳。

Method: 使用补丁式编码器-解码器架构增强LLM，在超过200万个交织的时间序列和文本示例上进行训练，涵盖预测、问答、模式解释、分类和报告生成等任务。

Result: TsLLM在需要时间序列分析与自然语言整合的任务上表现出色，虽然不旨在超越传统基准测试中的专业模型，但提供了现有方法无法实现的能力。

Conclusion: 这项工作建立了时间序列分析的新范式，弥合了数值计算和自然语言理解之间的差距，通过自然语言交互使复杂的时间推理能力民主化。

Abstract: Time series data is fundamental to decision-making in many crucial domains
including healthcare, finance, and environmental science. However, analyzing
this data often requires incorporating unstructured contextual information,
answering domain-specific questions, and generating natural language
explanations -- capabilities that traditional time series models lack due to
their inability to process text. While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at
contextual reasoning and knowledge integration, they struggle with numerical
time series due to inefficient text-based representations and limited exposure
to temporal data during pretraining. We address this gap by augmenting an LLM
with specialized time series perception through a patch-based encoder-decoder
architecture. We train this Time Series-augmented LLM (TsLLM) on a large corpus
of over 2 million interleaved time series and text examples spanning diverse
analysis tasks: forecasting with contextual information, time series
question-answering, pattern explanation, classification with natural language
outputs, and report generation. This training enables TsLLM to leverage both
its language understanding and newly acquired temporal reasoning capabilities.
While not designed to surpass specialized models on traditional benchmarks,
TsLLM demonstrates strong performance on tasks requiring the integration of
time series analysis with natural language -- capabilities that existing
approaches cannot provide. Our work establishes a new paradigm for time series
analysis that bridges numerical computation and natural language understanding,
democratizing access to sophisticated temporal reasoning through natural
language interaction.

Abstract: Because biometric data is sensitive, centralized training poses a privacy
risk, even though biometric recognition is essential for contemporary
applications. Federated learning (FL), which permits decentralized training,
provides a privacy-preserving substitute. Conventional FL, however, has trouble
with interpretability and heterogeneous data (non-IID). In order to handle
non-IID biometric data, this framework adds an attention mechanism at the
central server that weights local model updates according to their
significance. Differential privacy and secure update protocols safeguard data
while preserving accuracy. The A3-FL framework is evaluated in this study using
FVC2004 fingerprint data, with each client's features extracted using a Siamese
Convolutional Neural Network (Siamese-CNN). By dynamically modifying client
contributions, the attention mechanism increases the accuracy of the global
model.The accuracy, convergence speed, and robustness of the A3-FL framework
are superior to those of standard FL (FedAvg) and static baselines, according
to experimental evaluations using fingerprint data (FVC2004). The accuracy of
the attention-based approach was 0.8413, while FedAvg, Local-only, and
Centralized approaches were 0.8164, 0.7664, and 0.7997, respectively. Accuracy
stayed high at 0.8330 even with differential privacy. A scalable and
privacy-sensitive biometric system for secure and effective recognition in

### [260] [Eliciting Chain-of-Thought Reasoning for Time Series Analysis using Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01116)
*Felix Parker,Nimeesha Chan,Chi Zhang,Kimia Ghobadi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: COUNTS是首个通过强化学习训练LLM在时间序列任务上执行思维链推理的框架，使用残差向量量化VAE创建离散token，并通过两阶段训练显著提升LLM在时间序列分析中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有时间序列模型无法执行复杂推理（如反事实分析、逻辑推导等）的问题，以及LLM在时间序列任务上表现不佳的现状。

Method: 使用残差向量量化VAE创建高保真离散token，集成到预训练LLM词汇表中；采用两阶段训练：监督微调掌握新表示，然后通过Group Relative Policy Optimization在可验证问题上训练，使用鼓励显式推理步骤的提示策略。

Result: 实验表明，这种带有中间思维链推理的强化学习方法显著提升了LLM在各种时间序列分析任务中的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法为复杂时间数据推理开辟了新可能性，证明RL驱动的思维链推理能有效增强LLM在时间序列分析中的能力。

Abstract: Complex numerical time series analysis often demands multi-step reasoning
capabilities beyond current models' reach. Tasks like medical diagnosis and
weather forecasting require sequential reasoning processes -- including
counterfactual analysis, logical deduction, knowledge application, and
multi-modal contextual integration -- that existing time series models cannot
explicitly perform. While recent research has shown large language models
(LLMs) can achieve sophisticated Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning through
reinforcement learning (RL), these advances have primarily focused on
mathematical and coding domains, with LLMs still demonstrating poor performance
on time series tasks. We introduce Chain Of thought for Understanding Numerical
Time Series (COUNTS), the first framework that trains LLMs to perform CoT
reasoning across diverse time series tasks using RL with verifiable rewards.
Our approach employs a Residual Vector-Quantized VAE to create high-fidelity
discrete tokens that seamlessly integrate into a pre-trained LLM's vocabulary.
COUNTS undergoes a two-stage training process: first, supervised fine-tuning on
time series analysis tasks to master our novel representations, followed by
Group Relative Policy Optimization training on verifiable problems using
prompting strategies that encourage explicit reasoning steps before producing
final answers. Our experiments demonstrate that this RL-driven approach with
intermediate CoT reasoning significantly enhances LLM performance across
various time series analysis tasks, opening new possibilities for complex
temporal data reasoning.

*Sarwan Ali,Haris Mansoor,Murray Patterson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究提出将生物序列特征表示转换到双曲面空间的方法，通过计算双曲面特征的内积来构建核矩阵，从而更有效地分析序列关系并提高分类准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统机器学习方法在高维欧几里得空间中难以捕捉序列数据的复杂关系和层次结构，这限制了序列分类和相似性度量的准确性。

Method: 将生物序列特征表示变换到双曲面空间，在双曲面上映射序列以保留其固有结构信息，然后基于双曲面特征计算核矩阵来捕捉序列间的成对相似性。

Result: 实验评估表明，该方法能有效捕捉重要的序列相关性并提高分类准确率。

Conclusion: 将序列特征转换到双曲面空间的方法能够更好地处理生物序列的复杂结构，提升序列分析的效果。

Abstract: Genomic sequence analysis plays a crucial role in various scientific and
medical domains. Traditional machine-learning approaches often struggle to
capture the complex relationships and hierarchical structures of sequence data
when working in high-dimensional Euclidean spaces. This limitation hinders
accurate sequence classification and similarity measurement. To address these
challenges, this research proposes a method to transform the feature
representation of biological sequences into the hyperboloid space. By applying
a transformation, the sequences are mapped onto the hyperboloid, preserving
their inherent structural information. Once the sequences are represented in
the hyperboloid space, a kernel matrix is computed based on the hyperboloid
features. The kernel matrix captures the pairwise similarities between
sequences, enabling more effective analysis of biological sequence
relationships. This approach leverages the inner product of the hyperboloid
feature vectors to measure the similarity between pairs of sequences. The
experimental evaluation of the proposed approach demonstrates its efficacy in
capturing important sequence correlations and improving classification
accuracy.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Parallel-Distill-Refine (PDR)的推理方法，通过并行生成草稿、蒸馏到有限工作空间、然后精炼的方式，在保持准确率的同时降低上下文长度和延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs的推理训练鼓励生成长链思维(long CoT)，虽然提高了准确率，但增加了上下文长度、计算成本和答案延迟。作者希望探索是否能让模型利用元认知能力在准确率、上下文长度和延迟之间找到更好的平衡点。

Method: 提出了Parallel-Distill-Refine (PDR)方法：1) 并行生成多样化草稿；2) 蒸馏到有限文本工作空间；3) 基于工作空间进行精炼。通过控制并行度来控制上下文长度，将上下文长度与生成的总token数解耦。

Result: PDR方法在数学任务上表现优于长CoT，同时延迟更低。在AIME 2024上提升11%，AIME 2025上提升9%。当并行度为1时的Sequential Refinement (SR)方法也优于长CoT。

Conclusion: PDR推理方法能够在不牺牲准确率的情况下降低上下文长度和延迟，通过训练8B思维模型与RL结合，进一步提升了性能，表明模型编排可以改变帕累托前沿。

Abstract: Reasoning training incentivizes LLMs to produce long chains of thought (long
CoT), which among other things, allows them to explore solution strategies with
self-checking. This results in higher accuracy, but inflates context length,
token/compute cost, and answer latency. We ask: Can current models leverage
their metacognition to provide other combinations on this Pareto frontier,
e.g., better accuracy with lower context length and/or latency? Abstractly, we
view the model as an improvement operator on its own "thoughts" with a
continuum of possible strategies. We identify an interesting inference family
Parallel-Distill-Refine (PDR), which performs the following: (i) generate
diverse drafts in parallel; (ii) distill them into a bounded, textual
workspace; and (iii) refine conditioned on this workspace, producing an output
that seeds the next round. Importantly, context length (hence compute cost) is
controllable via degree of parallelism, and is no longer conflated with the
total number of generated tokens. We report PDR instantiations of current
models that give better accuracy than long CoT while incurring lower latency.
Setting degree of parallelism to 1 yields an interesting subcase, Sequential
Refinement (SR) (iteratively improve a single candidate answer) which provides
performance superior to long CoT. Success of such model orchestrations raises
the question whether further training could shift the Pareto frontier. To this
end, we train an 8B thinking model with Reinforcement Learning (RL) to make it
consistent with PDR as the inference method. On math tasks with verifiable
answers, iterative pipelines surpass single-pass baselines at matched
sequential budgets, with PDR delivering the largest gains (e.g., +11% on AIME
2024 and +9% on AIME 2025).

TL;DR: 本文系统分析了多轮强化学习中训练大语言模型代理的关键设计选择，将设计空间分解为环境、奖励和策略三个支柱，并通过实验得出训练LLM代理的配方。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有框架和定义碎片化，缺乏对多任务中设计选择的系统化分析和配方，需要填补这一空白。

Method: 将设计空间分解为环境、奖励和策略三个支柱，在TextWorld、ALFWorld和SWE-Gym等文本领域进行实证研究，分析任务复杂性、奖励稀疏性和策略梯度方法的影响。

Result: 发现简单环境能提供泛化信号，密集奖励加速训练但依赖RL算法选择，奖励稀疏性与策略梯度方法存在交互作用，找到了最优的SFT到RL训练比例。

Conclusion: 提炼出跨三个支柱协同设计的训练配方，促进多轮代理强化学习的研究和实践。

Abstract: We study what actually works and what doesn't for training large language
models as agents via multi-turn reinforcement learning. Despite rapid progress,
existing frameworks and definitions are fragmented, and there is no systematic
formulation or analysis of which design choices matter across tasks. We address
this gap by first breaking down the design space into three inter-related
pillars -- environment, reward, and policy -- and empirically derive a recipe
for training LLM agents in situated textual domains. In particular, we test
TextWorld and ALFWorld, popular domains for testing situated embodied
reasoning, as well as SWE-Gym for more software engineering style tasks. (i)
For the environment, we analyze the impacts of task complexity in terms of
sizes of the state and action spaces as well as optimal solution length,
finding that even simple environments within a domain can provide signal on how
well an agent can generalize to more complex tasks. (ii) For the reward, we
ablate relative reward sparsity, observing that while dense turn-level rewards
accelerate training, performance and stability is highly dependent on the
choice of RL algorithm. (iii) And for the agent's policy, we explore the
interplay between reward sparsity and biased (PPO, GRPO) and unbiased (RLOO)
policy gradient methods in addition to showing how to find the optimal
Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) to RL training ratio given a fixed budget. We
distill these findings into a training recipe that guides co-design across the
three pillars, facilitating research and practical efforts in multi-turn
agentic RL. Code: https://github.com/pearls-lab/meow-tea-taro

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Prompt Curriculum Learning (PCL)，一种轻量级强化学习算法，通过学习价值模型选择中等难度提示来后训练语言模型，在推理任务上实现更好的性能与效率平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 后训练LLMs通过强化学习对批处理和提示选择策略仍然敏感，需要找到平衡生成效率和梯度质量的最佳训练方法。

Method: PCL使用并发更新的价值模型以在线方式识别当前策略的中等难度提示，通过关注产生高有效比的信息提示来优化训练。

Result: PCL在MATH和DeepScaleR数据集上分别实现了12.1倍和16.9倍的提示识别速度提升，达到最高性能或显著减少达到可比性能所需时间。

Conclusion: PCL提供了一种新方法，在推理导向的强化学习中实现了改进的上限性能与效率之间的权衡。

Abstract: We introduce Prompt Curriculum Learning (PCL), a lightweight reinforcement
learning (RL) algorithm that selects intermediate-difficulty prompts using a
learned value model to post-train language models. Since post-training LLMs via
RL remains sensitive to batching and prompt selection strategies, we first
conduct a series of systematic experiments where we (1) determine the optimal
training batch size that balances generation efficiency and gradient quality
and (2) establish the importance of focusing on prompts of intermediate
difficulty for the policy. We build upon these results to design PCL, which
identifies prompts of intermediate difficulty for the current policy in an
on-policy manner by using a value model that is concurrently updated based on
the current policy. By focusing on informative prompts that yield high
effective ratios, PCL achieves either the highest performance or requires
significantly less time to reach comparable performance to its counterparts.
Compared to rollout-based filtering methods, PCL avoids costly rollouts and
achieves $12.1\times$ and $16.9\times$ faster speed on identifying
intermediate-difficulty prompts when training on MATH and DeepScaleR,
respectively. We further demonstrate that our value model accurately predicts
prompt difficulty and allows PCL to focus on progressively more challenging
prompts during RL. Our results present a new methodology that delivers improved
tradeoff between upper-bound performance and efficiency for reasoning-focused
RL.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TabINR是一个基于隐式神经表示(INR)的表格数据插补框架，通过可学习的行和特征嵌入处理离散表格结构，能够从部分观测中进行自适应插补。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实表格数据常因收集错误、隐私限制或传感器故障而不完整，简单插补策略会引入偏差或扭曲数据分布，需要高质量、鲁棒且快速推理的插补方法。

Method: 使用自动解码器架构的隐式神经表示框架，建模表格为神经函数，引入可学习的行和特征嵌入来处理表格数据的离散结构，支持从部分观测推断嵌入。

Result: 在12个真实世界数据集和多种缺失机制下评估，显示出持续强大的插补准确性，大多匹配或优于传统方法(KNN、MICE、MissForest)和深度学习模型(GAIN、ReMasker)，在高维数据集上优势最明显。

Conclusion: TabINR框架为表格数据插补提供了高质量、鲁棒且高效的解决方案，特别适用于高维数据集。

Abstract: Tabular data builds the basis for a wide range of applications, yet
real-world datasets are frequently incomplete due to collection errors, privacy
restrictions, or sensor failures. As missing values degrade the performance or
hinder the applicability of downstream models, and while simple imputing
strategies tend to introduce bias or distort the underlying data distribution,
we require imputers that provide high-quality imputations, are robust across
dataset sizes and yield fast inference. We therefore introduce TabINR, an
auto-decoder based Implicit Neural Representation (INR) framework that models
tables as neural functions. Building on recent advances in generalizable INRs,
we introduce learnable row and feature embeddings that effectively deal with
the discrete structure of tabular data and can be inferred from partial
observations, enabling instance adaptive imputations without modifying the
trained model. We evaluate our framework across a diverse range of twelve
real-world datasets and multiple missingness mechanisms, demonstrating
consistently strong imputation accuracy, mostly matching or outperforming
classical (KNN, MICE, MissForest) and deep learning based models (GAIN,
ReMasker), with the clearest gains on high-dimensional datasets.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于随机矩阵理论的梯度去噪后处理算法，用于提高差分隐私微调语言模型的样本效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DP-SGD在提供强隐私保证的同时，增加的噪声破坏了梯度矩阵的低秩结构，显著降低了优化效率

Method: 利用随机矩阵理论对DP-SGD中的梯度进行去噪后处理，恢复低秩结构并提高与原始信号的匹配度

Result: 在GLUE任务上对RoBERTa进行DP-SGD微调时，相比现有方法提高了样本效率，显著减少了达到次优性能所需的训练时间

Conclusion: 矩阵恢复技术可以在不损害隐私保证的前提下，有效提升私有语言模型训练的实用性

Abstract: We address the challenge of sample efficiency in differentially private
fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs) using DP-SGD. While DP-SGD provides
strong privacy guarantees, the added noise significantly increases the entropy
of gradient matrices, disrupting their low-rank structure and slowing
optimization. We propose a post-processing algorithm that leverages random
matrix theory to denoise gradients, restore low-rank structure, and improve
alignment with the original signal. Applied to DP-SGD fine-tuning of RoBERTa on
GLUE tasks, our method improves sample efficiency compared to state-of-the-art
approaches, substantially reducing training time when optimal performance is
not required. This work demonstrates that matrix recovery techniques can
enhance the utility of private language model training without compromising
privacy guarantees.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统最优传输方法计算复杂且需要对抗训练，本文旨在开发更高效、理论保证的求解框架。

Method: 基于HJ方程的特征线方法推导闭式传输映射，采用单一神经网络进行纯最小化训练，避免对抗训练阶段。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明该方法具有高精度、可扩展性和效率，支持多种成本函数和类条件传输。

Conclusion: 该框架为最优传输应用提供了理论严谨且通用的工具，具有可证明的最优性。

Abstract: We present a novel framework for solving optimal transport (OT) problems
based on the Hamilton--Jacobi (HJ) equation, whose viscosity solution uniquely
characterizes the OT map. By leveraging the method of characteristics, we
derive closed-form, bidirectional transport maps, thereby eliminating the need
for numerical integration. The proposed method adopts a pure minimization
framework: a single neural network is trained with a loss function derived from
the method of characteristics of the HJ equation. This design guarantees
convergence to the optimal map while eliminating adversarial training stages,
thereby substantially reducing computational complexity. Furthermore, the
framework naturally extends to a wide class of cost functions and supports
class-conditional transport. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets
demonstrate the accuracy, scalability, and efficiency of the proposed method,
establishing it as a principled and versatile tool for OT applications with
provable optimality.

Motivation: 在只有离散时间点观测数据的情况下，建模动力学并推断底层轨迹是一个重要但困难的任务。现有多边际轨迹推断算法存在局限性。

Method: 使用GAN启发的对抗性损失拟合源点和目标点之间的神经参数化插值曲线，使中间时间点的边际分布接近观测分布，然后通过流匹配算法对插值进行边际化。

Result: 在空间转录组学和细胞追踪数据集上优于现有基线方法，在单细胞轨迹预测上表现相当。

Conclusion: ALI-CFM方法具有多功能性和可扩展性，能够生成平滑的轨迹，并在温和假设下保证插值的唯一性。

Abstract: Learning the dynamics of a process given sampled observations at several time
points is an important but difficult task in many scientific applications. When
no ground-truth trajectories are available, but one has only snapshots of data
taken at discrete time steps, the problem of modelling the dynamics, and thus
inferring the underlying trajectories, can be solved by multi-marginal
generalisations of flow matching algorithms. This paper proposes a novel flow
matching method that overcomes the limitations of existing multi-marginal
trajectory inference algorithms. Our proposed method, ALI-CFM, uses a
GAN-inspired adversarial loss to fit neurally parametrised interpolant curves
between source and target points such that the marginal distributions at
intermediate time points are close to the observed distributions. The resulting
interpolants are smooth trajectories that, as we show, are unique under mild
assumptions. These interpolants are subsequently marginalised by a flow
matching algorithm, yielding a trained vector field for the underlying
dynamics. We showcase the versatility and scalability of our method by
outperforming the existing baselines on spatial transcriptomics and cell
tracking datasets, while performing on par with them on single-cell trajectory
prediction.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: M2PO是一种异步强化学习方法，通过约束重要性权重的二阶矩来抑制极端异常值，在高延迟设置下实现稳定的离策略训练，性能与在策略方法相当。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习方法依赖在策略训练，需要每次更新时生成新的轨迹数据，效率低且难以扩展。异步RL系统虽然解耦了轨迹生成和训练，但在处理高延迟数据时性能会下降或崩溃。

Method: 提出M2PO（二阶矩信任策略优化）方法，通过约束重要性权重的二阶矩来抑制极端异常值，同时保留信息性更新，在高延迟情况下精确屏蔽高方差标记。

Result: M2PO将高延迟下的剪裁标记比例从1.22%大幅降低到0.06%，在六个模型（1.7B到32B）和八个基准测试中，即使数据延迟达到256个模型更新，也能实现稳定的离策略训练，性能与在策略方法相当。

Conclusion: M2PO证明了在适当利用的情况下，延迟数据可以像在策略数据一样具有信息性，为大规模语言模型推理的高效强化学习训练提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has been central to recent advances in large language
model reasoning, but most algorithms rely on on-policy training that demands
fresh rollouts at every update, limiting efficiency and scalability.
Asynchronous RL systems alleviate this by decoupling rollout generation from
training, yet their effectiveness hinges on tolerating large staleness in
rollout data, a setting where existing methods either degrade in performance or
collapse. We revisit this challenge and uncover a prosperity-before-collapse
phenomenon: stale data can be as informative as on-policy data if exploited
properly. Building on this insight, we introduce M2PO (Second-Moment Trust
Policy Optimization), which constrains the second moment of importance weights
to suppress only extreme outliers while preserving informative updates.
Notably, M2PO sharply reduces the fraction of clipped tokens under high
staleness (from 1.22% to 0.06% over training), precisely masking high-variance
tokens while maintaining stable optimization. Extensive evaluation across six
models (from 1.7B to 32B) and eight benchmarks shows that M2PO delivers stable
off-policy training even with data stale by at least 256 model updates and
matches on-policy performance.

Motivation: 尽管上下文学习在大语言模型中持续有效，但其工作机制仍不清楚。研究旨在阐明预训练分布的统计特性如何塑造上下文学习能力，特别是数值任务上的表现。

Method: 开发了统一任务选择和泛化的理论框架，将贝叶斯后验一致性和集中性结果推广到重尾先验和依赖序列，并通过经验研究验证预训练分布对上下文学习性能的影响。

Result: 理论分析表明分布特性控制着样本效率、任务检索和鲁棒性。实证研究显示在随机微分方程和带记忆的随机过程等挑战性任务上，上下文学习性能随预训练分布变化。

Conclusion: 控制预训练分布的关键统计特性对于构建具有上下文学习能力和可靠的大语言模型至关重要。

Abstract: The emergence of in-context learning (ICL) in large language models (LLMs)
remains poorly understood despite its consistent effectiveness, enabling models
to adapt to new tasks from only a handful of examples. To clarify and improve
these capabilities, we characterize how the statistical properties of the
pretraining distribution (e.g., tail behavior, coverage) shape ICL on numerical
tasks. We develop a theoretical framework that unifies task selection and
generalization, extending and sharpening earlier results, and show how
distributional properties govern sample efficiency, task retrieval, and
robustness. To this end, we generalize Bayesian posterior consistency and
concentration results to heavy-tailed priors and dependent sequences, better
reflecting the structure of LLM pretraining data. We then empirically study how
ICL performance varies with the pretraining distribution on challenging tasks
such as stochastic differential equations and stochastic processes with memory.
Together, these findings suggest that controlling key statistical properties of
the pretraining distribution is essential for building ICL-capable and reliable
LLMs.

Abstract: Aligning large language models to human preferences is inherently
multidimensional, yet most pipelines collapse heterogeneous signals into a
single optimizeable objective. We seek to answer what it would take to
simultaneously align a model across various domains spanning those with:
verifiable rewards (mathematical accuracy), non-verifiable subjective
preferences (human values), and complex interactive scenarios (multi-turn AI
tutoring dialogues). Such multi-objective reinforcement learning setups are
often plagued by the individual objectives being at odds with each other,
resulting in inefficient training and little user control during inference. We
propose a unified framework that: (i) standardizes {process reward model} (PRM)
training across both verifiable and non-verifiable settings to better supervise
models' chain-of-thought reasoning; (ii) performs {multi-objective alignment}
by training the LLM with our $\textbf{M}$ulti-$\textbf{A}$ction-$\textbf{H}$ead
$\textbf{DPO}$ (MAH-DPO) and a vectorized reward where the dimensions of the
vector correspond to the various objectives instead of a single scalar; and
(iii) demonstrates how such a system provides fine-grained inference-time user
control. Experiments across math reasoning, value alignment, and multi-turn
dialogue show that our framework improves performance across multiple
objectives simultaneously, while minimizing cross-objective trade-offs and
enabling flexible inference time user control. The code can be found at

Abstract: Data is vital in enabling machine learning models to advance research and
practical applications in finance, where accurate and robust models are
essential for investment and trading decision-making. However, real-world data
is limited despite its quantity, quality, and variety. The data shortage of
various financial assets directly hinders the performance of machine learning
models designed to trade and invest in these assets. Generative methods can
mitigate this shortage. In this paper, we introduce a set of novel techniques
for time series data generation (we name them Fiaingen) and assess their
performance across three criteria: (a) overlap of real-world and synthetic data
on a reduced dimensionality space, (b) performance on downstream machine
learning tasks, and (c) runtime performance. Our experiments demonstrate that
the methods achieve state-of-the-art performance across the three criteria
listed above. Synthetic data generated with Fiaingen methods more closely
mirrors the original time series data while keeping data generation time close
to seconds - ensuring the scalability of the proposed approach. Furthermore,
models trained on it achieve performance close to those trained with real-world
data.

Conclusion: 这是首个刻画权重归一化如何利用过参数化实现矩阵感知问题更快收敛的工作。

Abstract: While normalization techniques are widely used in deep learning, their
theoretical understanding remains relatively limited. In this work, we
establish the benefits of (generalized) weight normalization (WN) applied to
the overparameterized matrix sensing problem. We prove that WN with Riemannian
optimization achieves linear convergence, yielding an exponential speedup over
standard methods that do not use WN. Our analysis further demonstrates that
both iteration and sample complexity improve polynomially as the level of
overparameterization increases. To the best of our knowledge, this work
provides the first characterization of how WN leverages overparameterization
for faster convergence in matrix sensing.

Conclusion: COM-BOM能够有效平衡预测准确性和模型校准，为可信AI部署提供了更好的示例选择方案

Abstract: Selecting an optimal set of exemplars is critical for good performance of
in-context learning. However, prior exemplar search methods narrowly optimize
for predictive accuracy, critically neglecting model calibration--a key
determinant of trustworthiness and safe deployment. In this paper, we formulate
exemplar selection as a multi-objective optimization problem, explicitly
targeting both the maximization of predictive accuracy and the minimization of
expected calibration error. We solve this problem with a sample-efficient
Combinatorial Bayesian Optimization algorithm (COM-BOM) to find the Pareto
front that optimally trades off the two objectives of accuracy and calibration.
We evaluate COM-BOM on multiple tasks from unsaturated MMLU-Pro benchmark and
find that COM-BOM beats or matches the baselines at jointly optimizing the two
objectives, while requiring a minimal number of LLM API calls.

Result: 在Toucan上微调的模型在BFCL V3基准测试中超越了更大的闭源模型，并在MCP-Universe Bench上推进了帕累托前沿。

Conclusion: Toucan数据集通过提供大规模、高质量的工具-智能体训练数据，有效促进了开源社区在LLM智能体系统方面的发展。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents are rapidly emerging as powerful systems
for automating tasks across domains. Yet progress in the open-source community
is constrained by the lack of high quality permissively licensed tool-agentic
training data. Existing datasets are often limited in diversity, realism, and
complexity, particularly regarding multi-tool and multi-turn interactions. To
address this gap, we introduce Toucan, the largest publicly available
tool-agentic dataset to date, containing 1.5 million trajectories synthesized
from nearly 500 real-world Model Context Protocols (MCPs). Unlike prior work,
Toucan leverages authentic MCP environments to generate diverse, realistic, and
challenging tasks with trajectories involving real tool execution. Our pipeline
first produces a broad spectrum of tool-use queries using five distinct models,
applies model-based quality filtering, and then generates agentic trajectories
with three teacher models using two agentic frameworks. Rigorous rule-based and
model-based validation ensures high-quality outputs. We also introduce three
extension mechanisms to further diversify tasks and simulate multi-turn
conversations. Models fine-tuned on Toucan outperform larger closed-source
counterparts on the BFCL V3 benchmark and push the Pareto frontier forward on
MCP-Universe Bench.

TL;DR: 本文提出BroRL方法，通过增加每个样本的rollout数量来扩展强化学习，解决了ProRL方法在数千步训练后性能饱和的问题，实现了持续的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ProRL方法通过增加训练步数来扩展强化学习，但性能在数千步后达到饱和，显示出明显的收益递减。本文探索通过增加每个样本的rollout数量来扩展RL的补充范式。

Method: 提出BroRL方法，将每个样本的rollout数量增加到数百个，以充分扩展探索范围。基于质量平衡方程分析，理论证明随着rollout数量增加，未采样项的影响会减弱，确保正确token概率质量的整体扩展。

Result: BroRL方法成功复活了在3K步ProRL训练后饱和的模型，并展现出稳健的持续改进。在1.5B模型上，在多个基准测试中实现了最先进的结果。

Conclusion: 增加rollout数量是扩展强化学习的有效补充范式，能够突破训练步数扩展的性能饱和限制，为复杂推理能力的解锁提供了新的途径。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a key
ingredient for unlocking complex reasoning capabilities in large language
models. Recent work ProRL has shown promise in scaling RL by increasing the
number of training steps. However, performance plateaus after thousands of
steps, with clear diminishing returns from allocating more computation to
additional training. In this work, we investigate a complementary paradigm for
scaling RL, BroR-Lincreasing the number of rollouts per example to hundreds to
exhaustively Broaden exploration, which yields continuous performance gains
beyond the saturation point observed in ProRL when scaling the number of
training steps. Our approach is motivated by a mass balance equation analysis
allowing us to characterize the rate of change in probability mass for correct
and incorrect tokens during the reinforcement process. We show that under a
one-step RL assumption, sampled rollout tokens always contribute to
correct-mass expansion, while unsampled tokens outside rollouts may lead to
gains or losses depending on their distribution and the net reward balance.
Importantly, as the number of rollouts per example N increases, the effect of
unsampled terms diminishes, ensuring overall correct-mass expansion. To
validate our theoretical analysis, we conduct simulations under more relaxed
conditions and find that a sufficiently large rollout size N-corresponding to
ample exploration-guarantees an increase in the probability mass of all correct
tokens. Empirically, BroRL revives models saturated after 3K ProRL training
steps and demonstrates robust, continuous improvement, achieving
state-of-the-art results for the 1.5B model across diverse benchmarks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种控制去噪扩散和流匹配模型采样多样性的机制，允许用户从比训练分布更尖锐或更宽泛的分布中采样，无需微调即可应用于现成模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的扩散模型和流匹配模型缺乏对采样多样性的灵活控制，用户无法根据具体任务需求调整采样的分布特性。

Method: 通过重新缩放噪声数据分布的（学习到的）得分函数来控制局部采样温度，该方法兼容确定性和随机性采样器。

Result: 在图像生成、姿态估计、深度预测、机器人操作和蛋白质设计等五个不同任务上验证了方法的有效性，能够采样更尖锐或更平坦的分布。

Conclusion: 该方法为扩散模型提供了灵活的采样多样性控制，在不同任务中都能带来性能提升，具有广泛的适用性。

Abstract: We present a mechanism to steer the sampling diversity of denoising diffusion
and flow matching models, allowing users to sample from a sharper or broader
distribution than the training distribution. We build on the observation that
these models leverage (learned) score functions of noisy data distributions for
sampling and show that rescaling these allows one to effectively control a
`local' sampling temperature. Notably, this approach does not require any
finetuning or alterations to training strategy, and can be applied to any
off-the-shelf model and is compatible with both deterministic and stochastic
samplers. We first validate our framework on toy 2D data, and then demonstrate
its application for diffusion models trained across five disparate tasks --
image generation, pose estimation, depth prediction, robot manipulation, and
protein design. We find that across these tasks, our approach allows sampling
from sharper (or flatter) distributions, yielding performance gains e.g., depth
prediction models benefit from sampling more likely depth estimates, whereas
image generation models perform better when sampling a slightly flatter
distribution. Project page: https://temporalscorerescaling.github.io

TL;DR: 提出Dirichlet-Prior Shaping Loss (DPSL)方法，通过匹配专家分配与目标Dirichlet先验来直接塑造路由概率分布，解决了预训练密集模型上采样为稀疏MoE时的专家专业化不足问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练密集模型上采样为稀疏MoE时，由于简单的权重复制导致专家专业化不足，即使使用传统正则化方法，路由仍然表现出低置信度和弱分化，限制了性能提升。

Method: 引入DPSL路由器正则化技术，通过将专家分配匹配到目标Dirichlet先验来直接塑造路由概率分布，提供对专家平衡和专业化的细粒度控制，并能编码归纳偏置。

Result: 在基于Qwen2、Phi3、Llama3.2 LLM骨干的上采样MoE视觉语言模型实验中，DPSL在标准视觉语言基准上始终优于上采样策略和正则化技术。

Conclusion: DPSL解决了专家专业化不足的关键问题，促进了更具适应性、性能更高的模型，且作为通用工具可应用于任何输出分类概率分布的模块。

Abstract: Upcycling pre-trained dense models into sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoEs)
efficiently increases model capacity but often suffers from poor expert
specialization due to naive weight replication. Our analysis reveals that
upcycled MoEs, even with conventional regularization, exhibit low-confidence,
weakly differentiated routing, hindering performance. We introduce
Dirichlet-Prior Shaping Loss (DPSL), a novel router regularization technique
that directly shapes routing probability distributions by matching expert
assignments to a target Dirichlet prior. DPSL offers fine-grained control over
expert balance and specialization, and enables encoding of inductive biases
such as encouraging experts to focus on specific modalities or tasks, without
requiring manual intervention; notably, DPSL is a general tool applicable to
any module that outputs categorical probability distributions, extending its
utility beyond MoE training. Experiments on upcycled MoE vision-language models
(with Qwen2, Phi3, Llama3.2 LLM backbones) show DPSL consistently outperforms
upcycling strategies and regularization techniques across standard
vision-language benchmarks, addressing the critical issue of poor
specialization and fostering more adaptive, higher-performing models.
