### [1] [Facial Emotion Recognition does not detect feeling unsafe in automated driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04490)
*Abel van Elburg,Konstantinos Gkentsidis,Mathieu Sarrazin,Sarah Barendswaard,Varun Kotian,Riender Happee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文通过驾驶模拟器实验研究了自动驾驶车的风险感知，发现车辆运动和皮电导可以预测风险感知，而面部表情识别效果不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究自动驾驶车的风险感知对公众接受度至关重要，需要寻找可靠的客观风险评估方法。

Method: 使用32名参与者在驾驶模拟器中体验两种自动驾驶风格，收集主观舒适度、车辆运动、面部表情、皮电导、心率和眼动跟踪数据。

Result: 动态驾驶风格导致更强的不舒适感，行人突然出现增加风险感知。面部表情识别不可靠，但神经网络模型通过车辆运动和皮电导能够预测风险感知。

Conclusion: 车辆运动和皮电导可以作为客观风险感知评估的有效方法，减少主观偏差，为自动驾驶车的风险评估提供了新方向。

Abstract: Trust and perceived safety play a crucial role in the public acceptance of
automated vehicles. To understand perceived risk, an experiment was conducted
using a driving simulator under two automated driving styles and optionally
introducing a crossing pedestrian. Data was collected from 32 participants,
consisting of continuous subjective comfort ratings, motion, webcam footage for
facial expression, skin conductance, heart rate, and eye tracking. The
continuous subjective perceived risk ratings showed significant discomfort
associated with perceived risk during cornering and braking followed by relief
or even positive comfort on continuing the ride. The dynamic driving style
induced a stronger discomfort as compared to the calm driving style. The
crossing pedestrian did not affect discomfort with the calm driving style but
doubled the comfort decrement with the dynamic driving style. This illustrates
the importance of consequences of critical interactions in risk perception.
Facial expression was successfully analyzed for 24 participants but most
(15/24) did not show any detectable facial reaction to the critical event.
Among the 9 participants who did, 8 showed a Happy expression, and only 4
showed a Surprise expression. Fear was never dominant. This indicates that
facial expression recognition is not a reliable method for assessing perceived
risk in automated vehicles. To predict perceived risk a neural network model
was implemented using vehicle motion and skin conductance. The model correlated
well with reported perceived risk, demonstrating its potential for objective
perceived risk assessment in automated vehicles, reducing subjective bias and
highlighting areas for future research.

### [2] [PromptEnhancer: A Simple Approach to Enhance Text-to-Image Models via Chain-of-Thought Prompt Rewriting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04545)
*Linqing Wang,Ximing Xing,Yiji Cheng,Zhiyuan Zhao,Jiale Tao,Qixun Wang,Ruihuang Li,Xin Li,Mingrui Wu,Xinchi Deng,Chunyu Wang,Qinglin Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PromptEnhancer是一个通用的提示词重写框架，通过强化学习训练Chain-of-Thought重写器，显著提升文本到图像生成模型对复杂提示的理解能力，无需修改模型权重。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到图像扩散模型在处理复杂用户提示时存在属性绑定、否定和组合关系等方面的困难，导致用户意图与生成结果不匹配。

Method: 提出PromptEnhancer框架，通过强化学习训练Chain-of-Thought重写器，使用专门的AlignEvaluator奖励模型提供细粒度反馈，基于24个关键点的系统分类法优化提示重写。

Result: 在HunyuanImage 2.1模型上的广泛实验表明，PromptEnhancer显著提高了图像-文本对齐度，能够处理各种语义和组合挑战。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了文本到图像生成中的提示理解问题，并引入了新的人类偏好基准数据集，为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: Recent advancements in text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities in generating high-fidelity images. However, these
models often struggle to faithfully render complex user prompts, particularly
in aspects like attribute binding, negation, and compositional relationships.
This leads to a significant mismatch between user intent and the generated
output. To address this challenge, we introduce PromptEnhancer, a novel and
universal prompt rewriting framework that enhances any pretrained T2I model
without requiring modifications to its weights. Unlike prior methods that rely
on model-specific fine-tuning or implicit reward signals like image-reward
scores, our framework decouples the rewriter from the generator. We achieve
this by training a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) rewriter through reinforcement
learning, guided by a dedicated reward model we term the AlignEvaluator. The
AlignEvaluator is trained to provide explicit and fine-grained feedback based
on a systematic taxonomy of 24 key points, which are derived from a
comprehensive analysis of common T2I failure modes. By optimizing the CoT
rewriter to maximize the reward from our AlignEvaluator, our framework learns
to generate prompts that are more precisely interpreted by T2I models.
Extensive experiments on the HunyuanImage 2.1 model demonstrate that
PromptEnhancer significantly improves image-text alignment across a wide range
of semantic and compositional challenges. Furthermore, we introduce a new,
high-quality human preference benchmark to facilitate future research in this
direction.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniPic2-SD3.5M-Kontext是一个2B参数的DiT模型，通过架构改进和大规模预训练，结合创新的渐进式双任务强化策略，在图像生成和编辑任务上超越了更大参数量的模型，并扩展为统一的多模态框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前许多开源多模态模型过度关注参数规模扩展而忽视训练策略优化，导致效率和性能受限。本文旨在通过优化训练策略而非单纯增加参数来提升模型性能。

Method: 基于SD3.5-Medium进行架构修改，大规模高质量数据预训练，提出渐进式双任务强化策略(PDTR)分阶段强化指令跟随和编辑一致性，最后通过连接器将图像模型与视觉语言模型集成训练。

Result: UniPic2-SD3.5M-Kontext在图像生成和编辑能力上超越了参数更大的BAGEL(7B)和Flux-Kontext(12B)模型，UniPic2-Metaquery在多种任务上达到顶级性能。

Conclusion: 提出的训练范式Skywork UniPic 2.0被证明是有效且具有泛化性的，通过优化训练策略而非单纯扩大参数规模，可以实现更好的性能表现。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal models have demonstrated impressive
capabilities in unified image generation and editing. However, many prominent
open-source models prioritize scaling model parameters over optimizing training
strategies, limiting their efficiency and performance. In this work, we present
UniPic2-SD3.5M-Kontext, a 2B-parameter DiT model based on SD3.5-Medium, which
achieves state-of-the-art image generation and editing while extending
seamlessly into a unified multimodal framework. Our approach begins with
architectural modifications to SD3.5-Medium and large-scale pre-training on
high-quality data, enabling joint text-to-image generation and editing
capabilities. To enhance instruction following and editing consistency, we
propose a novel Progressive Dual-Task Reinforcement strategy (PDTR), which
effectively strengthens both tasks in a staged manner. We empirically validate
that the reinforcement phases for different tasks are mutually beneficial and
do not induce negative interference. After pre-training and reinforcement
strategies, UniPic2-SD3.5M-Kontext demonstrates stronger image generation and
editing capabilities than models with significantly larger generation
parameters-including BAGEL (7B) and Flux-Kontext (12B). Furthermore, following
the MetaQuery, we connect the UniPic2-SD3.5M-Kontext and Qwen2.5-VL-7B via a
connector and perform joint training to launch a unified multimodal model
UniPic2-Metaquery. UniPic2-Metaquery integrates understanding, generation, and
editing, achieving top-tier performance across diverse tasks with a simple and
scalable training paradigm. This consistently validates the effectiveness and
generalizability of our proposed training paradigm, which we formalize as
Skywork UniPic 2.0.

### [4] [Inpaint4Drag: Repurposing Inpainting Models for Drag-Based Image Editing via Bidirectional Warping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04582)
*Jingyi Lu,Kai Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Inpaint4Drag是一个基于像素空间双向变形和图像修复的拖拽式图像编辑框架，实现了实时变形预览和高效修复，显著提升交互体验


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有拖拽式图像编辑方法主要依赖生成模型的潜在空间操作，导致精度有限、反馈延迟和模型特定限制，需要更精确高效的解决方案

Method: 将拖拽编辑分解为像素空间双向变形和图像修复，将图像区域视为可变形材料，通过弹性物体变形原理实现自然形状保持

Result: 在512x512分辨率下实现0.01秒的实时变形预览和0.3秒的高效修复，相比现有方法需要数分钟每次编辑有显著提升

Conclusion: 该方法作为通用适配器可兼容任何修复模型，无需架构修改即可自动继承修复技术的未来改进，在视觉质量和精确控制方面表现优异

Abstract: Drag-based image editing has emerged as a powerful paradigm for intuitive
image manipulation. However, existing approaches predominantly rely on
manipulating the latent space of generative models, leading to limited
precision, delayed feedback, and model-specific constraints. Accordingly, we
present Inpaint4Drag, a novel framework that decomposes drag-based editing into
pixel-space bidirectional warping and image inpainting. Inspired by elastic
object deformation in the physical world, we treat image regions as deformable
materials that maintain natural shape under user manipulation. Our method
achieves real-time warping previews (0.01s) and efficient inpainting (0.3s) at
512x512 resolution, significantly improving the interaction experience compared
to existing methods that require minutes per edit. By transforming drag inputs
directly into standard inpainting formats, our approach serves as a universal
adapter for any inpainting model without architecture modification,
automatically inheriting all future improvements in inpainting technology.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior visual
quality and precise control while maintaining real-time performance. Project

### [5] [DisPatch: Disarming Adversarial Patches in Object Detection with Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04597)
*Jin Ma,Mohammed Aldeen,Christopher Salas,Feng Luo,Mashrur Chowdhury,Mert Pesé,Long Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DISPATCH是一个基于扩散模型的物体检测防御框架，采用"再生和修正"策略来对抗对抗性补丁攻击，无需先验知识即可有效防御多种攻击类型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的物体检测器容易受到对抗性补丁攻击，可能导致严重后果。理想的防御方法需要具备有效性、通用性和对自适应攻击的鲁棒性。

Method: 利用扩散模型的生成能力重新生成整个图像，使其与良性数据对齐，然后通过修正过程识别并替换对抗性区域为重新生成的良性对应部分。

Result: 在多种检测器和攻击测试中，DISPATCH在隐藏攻击上达到89.3%的mAP.5分数，在无目标创建攻击上将攻击成功率降至24.8%，表现优于现有最佳防御方法。

Conclusion: DISPATCH是首个基于扩散模型的物体检测防御框架，具有攻击无关性、无需先验知识、对自适应攻击强鲁棒性等特点，为物体检测系统提供了实用可靠的防御方案。

Abstract: Object detection is fundamental to various real-world applications, such as
security monitoring and surveillance video analysis. Despite their
advancements, state-of-theart object detectors are still vulnerable to
adversarial patch attacks, which can be easily applied to real-world objects to
either conceal actual items or create non-existent ones, leading to severe
consequences. Given the current diversity of adversarial patch attacks and
potential unknown threats, an ideal defense method should be effective,
generalizable, and robust against adaptive attacks. In this work, we introduce
DISPATCH, the first diffusion-based defense framework for object detection.
Unlike previous works that aim to "detect and remove" adversarial patches,
DISPATCH adopts a "regenerate and rectify" strategy, leveraging generative
models to disarm attack effects while preserving the integrity of the input
image. Specifically, we utilize the in-distribution generative power of
diffusion models to regenerate the entire image, aligning it with benign data.
A rectification process is then employed to identify and replace adversarial
regions with their regenerated benign counterparts. DISPATCH is attack-agnostic
and requires no prior knowledge of the existing patches. Extensive experiments
across multiple detectors and attacks demonstrate that DISPATCH consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art defenses on both hiding attacks and creating
attacks, achieving the best overall mAP.5 score of 89.3% on hiding attacks, and
lowering the attack success rate to 24.8% on untargeted creating attacks.
Moreover, it maintains strong robustness against adaptive attacks, making it a
practical and reliable defense for object detection systems.

*Qijun Ying,Zhongyuan Hu,Rui Zhang,Ronghui Li,Yu Lu,Zijiao Zeng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WATCH是一个从单目视频重建全局人体运动的统一框架，通过角度分解和轨迹整合机制解决了相机-人体运动关系建模的挑战，在轨迹重建方面达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决从单目视频重建全局人体运动时的深度模糊、运动模糊以及相机与人体运动纠缠问题，特别是现有方法在相机方向信息利用和相机平移线索整合方面的不足。

Method: 提出WATCH框架，包含解析性航向角分解技术和受世界模型启发的相机轨迹整合机制，能够高效利用相机方向信息和平移信息。

Result: 在野外基准测试中实现了端到端轨迹重建的最先进性能，证明了联合建模相机-人体运动关系的有效性。

Conclusion: 该工作为解决相机平移整合这一长期挑战提供了新见解，代码将公开可用。

Abstract: Global human motion reconstruction from in-the-wild monocular videos is
increasingly demanded across VR, graphics, and robotics applications, yet
requires accurate mapping of human poses from camera to world coordinates-a
task challenged by depth ambiguity, motion ambiguity, and the entanglement
between camera and human movements. While human-motion-centric approaches excel
in preserving motion details and physical plausibility, they suffer from two
critical limitations: insufficient exploitation of camera orientation
information and ineffective integration of camera translation cues. We present
WATCH (World-aware Allied Trajectory and pose reconstruction for Camera and
Human), a unified framework addressing both challenges. Our approach introduces
an analytical heading angle decomposition technique that offers superior
efficiency and extensibility compared to existing geometric methods.
Additionally, we design a camera trajectory integration mechanism inspired by
world models, providing an effective pathway for leveraging camera translation
information beyond naive hard-decoding approaches. Through experiments on
in-the-wild benchmarks, WATCH achieves state-of-the-art performance in
end-to-end trajectory reconstruction. Our work demonstrates the effectiveness
of jointly modeling camera-human motion relationships and offers new insights
for addressing the long-standing challenge of camera translation integration in
global human motion reconstruction. The code will be available publicly.

### [7] [Sali4Vid: Saliency-Aware Video Reweighting and Adaptive Caption Retrieval for Dense Video Captioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04602)
*MinJu Jeon,Si-Woo Kim,Ye-Chan Kim,HyunGee Kim,Dong-Jin Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Sali4Vid是一个基于显著性的密集视频字幕框架，通过视频重加权和自适应字幕检索来解决现有方法的时间戳监督不足和场景转换忽略问题，在YouCook2和ViTT数据集上达到最先进效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有端到端密集视频字幕模型存在两个主要问题：(1)仅对文本应用时间戳监督，而将所有视频帧同等对待；(2)从固定大小的视频块中检索字幕，忽略了场景转换。

Method: 提出Sali4Vid框架，包含两个核心组件：1)显著性感知视频重加权 - 将时间戳标注转换为基于sigmoid的帧重要性权重；2)基于语义的自适应字幕检索 - 通过帧相似性分割视频以捕捉场景转换并改进字幕检索。

Result: 在YouCook2和ViTT数据集上实现了最先进的性能表现。

Conclusion: 联合改进视频加权和检索方法对密集视频字幕任务具有显著益处，Sali4Vid框架简单而有效。

Abstract: Dense video captioning aims to temporally localize events in video and
generate captions for each event. While recent works propose end-to-end models,
they suffer from two limitations: (1) applying timestamp supervision only to
text while treating all video frames equally, and (2) retrieving captions from
fixed-size video chunks, overlooking scene transitions. To address these, we
propose Sali4Vid, a simple yet effective saliency-aware framework. We introduce
Saliency-aware Video Reweighting, which converts timestamp annotations into
sigmoid-based frame importance weights, and Semantic-based Adaptive Caption
Retrieval, which segments videos by frame similarity to capture scene
transitions and improve caption retrieval. Sali4Vid achieves state-of-the-art
results on YouCook2 and ViTT, demonstrating the benefit of jointly improving
video weighting and retrieval for dense video captioning

Abstract: Traffic congestion and violations pose significant challenges for urban
mobility and road safety. Traditional traffic monitoring systems, such as fixed
cameras and sensor-based methods, are often constrained by limited coverage,
low adaptability, and poor scalability. To address these challenges, this paper
introduces an advanced unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based traffic surveillance
system capable of accurate vehicle detection, classification, tracking, and
behavioral analysis in real-world, unconstrained urban environments. The system
leverages multi-scale and multi-angle template matching, Kalman filtering, and
homography-based calibration to process aerial video data collected from
altitudes of approximately 200 meters. A case study in urban area demonstrates
robust performance, achieving a detection precision of 91.8%, an F1-score of
90.5%, and tracking metrics (MOTA/MOTP) of 92.1% and 93.7%, respectively.
Beyond precise detection, the system classifies five vehicle types and
automatically detects critical traffic violations, including unsafe lane
changes, illegal double parking, and crosswalk obstructions, through the fusion
of geofencing, motion filtering, and trajectory deviation analysis. The
integrated analytics module supports origin-destination tracking, vehicle count
visualization, inter-class correlation analysis, and heatmap-based congestion
modeling. Additionally, the system enables entry-exit trajectory profiling,
vehicle density estimation across road segments, and movement direction
logging, supporting comprehensive multi-scale urban mobility analytics.
Experimental results confirms the system's scalability, accuracy, and practical
relevance, highlighting its potential as an enforcement-aware,
infrastructure-independent traffic monitoring solution for next-generation
smart cities.

*Mustafa Munir,Alex Zhang,Radu Marculescu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VCMamba是一种新颖的视觉骨干网络，结合了CNN的局部特征提取能力和Mamba SSM的全局建模能力，在ImageNet和ADE20K上取得了优异性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决ViT和SSM在细粒度局部特征提取方面的不足，以及CNN在全局推理能力上的局限，需要融合两者的优势

Method: 采用卷积主干和分层结构，早期阶段使用卷积块提取局部特征，后期阶段使用多方向Mamba块建模长程依赖和全局上下文

Result: VCMamba-B在ImageNet-1K上达到82.6% top-1准确率，参数量减少37-64%；在ADE20K上获得47.1 mIoU，参数量减少62%

Conclusion: VCMamba成功融合了CNN和Mamba SSM的优势，在保持线性复杂度的同时实现了优异的特征表示能力

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision Transformers (ViTs) and State Space Models (SSMs)
have challenged the dominance of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in
computer vision. ViTs excel at capturing global context, and SSMs like Mamba
offer linear complexity for long sequences, yet they do not capture
fine-grained local features as effectively as CNNs. Conversely, CNNs possess
strong inductive biases for local features but lack the global reasoning
capabilities of transformers and Mamba. To bridge this gap, we introduce
\textit{VCMamba}, a novel vision backbone that integrates the strengths of CNNs
and multi-directional Mamba SSMs. VCMamba employs a convolutional stem and a
hierarchical structure with convolutional blocks in its early stages to extract
rich local features. These convolutional blocks are then processed by later
stages incorporating multi-directional Mamba blocks designed to efficiently
model long-range dependencies and global context. This hybrid design allows for
superior feature representation while maintaining linear complexity with
respect to image resolution. We demonstrate VCMamba's effectiveness through
extensive experiments on ImageNet-1K classification and ADE20K semantic
segmentation. Our VCMamba-B achieves 82.6% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K,
surpassing PlainMamba-L3 by 0.3% with 37% fewer parameters, and outperforming
Vision GNN-B by 0.3% with 64% fewer parameters. Furthermore, VCMamba-B obtains
47.1 mIoU on ADE20K, exceeding EfficientFormer-L7 by 2.0 mIoU while utilizing
62% fewer parameters. Code is available at

*Vanshika Vats,Ashwani Rathee,James Davis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出多智能体训练免费框架，通过Worker-Supervisor迭代架构协调视觉语言模型，确保语义分割结果严格遵循复杂的文本标注指南


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中的语义分割不仅需要准确的分割掩码，还必须严格遵守复杂的文本标注指南。传统方法需要昂贵的任务特定重新训练，而现有的开放词汇分割方法在处理段落长度的复杂指南时经常失败

Method: 多智能体训练免费框架，包含Worker执行分割、Supervisor根据检索到的指南进行批判、轻量级强化学习停止策略决定循环终止的迭代Worker-Supervisor精炼架构

Result: 在Waymo和ReasonSeg数据集上评估，显著优于最先进的基线方法，展示了强大的泛化能力和指令遵循能力

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效解决复杂标注指南的遵循问题，在保证分割质量的同时平衡资源使用，为实际应用提供了可行的解决方案

Abstract: Semantic segmentation in real-world applications often requires not only
accurate masks but also strict adherence to textual labeling guidelines. These
guidelines are typically complex and long, and both human and automated
labeling often fail to follow them faithfully. Traditional approaches depend on
expensive task-specific retraining that must be repeated as the guidelines
evolve. Although recent open-vocabulary segmentation methods excel with simple
prompts, they often fail when confronted with sets of paragraph-length
guidelines that specify intricate segmentation rules. To address this, we
introduce a multi-agent, training-free framework that coordinates
general-purpose vision-language models within an iterative Worker-Supervisor
refinement architecture. The Worker performs the segmentation, the Supervisor
critiques it against the retrieved guidelines, and a lightweight reinforcement
learning stop policy decides when to terminate the loop, ensuring
guideline-consistent masks while balancing resource use. Evaluated on the Waymo
and ReasonSeg datasets, our method notably outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines, demonstrating strong generalization and instruction adherence.

### [11] [Domain Adaptation for Different Sensor Configurations in 3D Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04711)
*Satoshi Tanaka,Kok Seang Tan,Isamu Yamashita*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文针对不同传感器配置导致的3D目标检测性能下降问题，提出了下游微调和部分层微调两种技术，有效提升了跨配置泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 不同自动驾驶平台使用不同的传感器配置，导致点云分布差异，使得在一个配置上训练的模型在其他配置上性能下降。现有研究主要关注环境域差距和单一LiDAR内的密度变化，而不同传感器配置间的域差距尚未充分探索。

Method: 提出了两种技术：1）下游微调 - 在多数据集训练后进行数据集特定的微调；2）部分层微调 - 只更新部分网络层以提高跨配置泛化能力。使用同一地理区域采集的多传感器配置配对数据集进行实验。

Result: 实验表明，联合训练结合下游微调和部分层微调的方法，在每个配置上都持续优于简单的联合训练方法。

Conclusion: 该研究为3D目标检测模型适应多样化车辆平台提供了实用且可扩展的解决方案，有效解决了不同传感器配置间的域适应问题。

Abstract: Recent advances in autonomous driving have underscored the importance of
accurate 3D object detection, with LiDAR playing a central role due to its
robustness under diverse visibility conditions. However, different vehicle
platforms often deploy distinct sensor configurations, causing performance
degradation when models trained on one configuration are applied to another
because of shifts in the point cloud distribution. Prior work on multi-dataset
training and domain adaptation for 3D object detection has largely addressed
environmental domain gaps and density variation within a single LiDAR; in
contrast, the domain gap for different sensor configurations remains largely
unexplored. In this work, we address domain adaptation across different sensor
configurations in 3D object detection. We propose two techniques: Downstream
Fine-tuning (dataset-specific fine-tuning after multi-dataset training) and
Partial Layer Fine-tuning (updating only a subset of layers to improve
cross-configuration generalization). Using paired datasets collected in the
same geographic region with multiple sensor configurations, we show that joint
training with Downstream Fine-tuning and Partial Layer Fine-tuning consistently
outperforms naive joint training for each configuration. Our findings provide a
practical and scalable solution for adapting 3D object detection models to the
diverse vehicle platforms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 遥感图像常被云层遮挡，影响数据完整性。云检测需要同时处理短程空间冗余和长程大气相似性，现有方法难以兼顾局部和全局特征

Method: CD-Mamba混合架构，集成卷积神经网络（处理局部空间依赖）和Mamba状态空间模型（处理长程依赖），统一网络同时捕获像素级纹理细节和块级长程依赖

Result: 大量实验验证了CD-Mamba的有效性，相比现有方法表现出更优越的性能

Conclusion: CD-Mamba通过融合卷积和Mamba的优势，能够同时处理不同空间尺度的云检测任务，显著提高了检测精度

Abstract: Remote sensing images are frequently obscured by cloud cover, posing
significant challenges to data integrity and reliability. Effective cloud
detection requires addressing both short-range spatial redundancies and
long-range atmospheric similarities among cloud patches. Convolutional neural
networks are effective at capturing local spatial dependencies, while Mamba has
strong capabilities in modeling long-range dependencies. To fully leverage both
local spatial relations and long-range dependencies, we propose CD-Mamba, a
hybrid model that integrates convolution and Mamba's state-space modeling into
a unified cloud detection network. CD-Mamba is designed to comprehensively
capture pixelwise textural details and long term patchwise dependencies for
cloud detection. This design enables CD-Mamba to manage both pixel-wise
interactions and extensive patch-wise dependencies simultaneously, improving
detection accuracy across diverse spatial scales. Extensive experiments
validate the effectiveness of CD-Mamba and demonstrate its superior performance
over existing methods.

TL;DR: 通过任务一致性训练框架(TCT)解决医学图像分割中的类别不平衡问题，无需额外模型且避免标签噪声


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多类医学图像分割中全标注数据难以获取，部分标注数据集存在类别不平衡问题，现有方法需额外模型且容易产生标签噪声

Method: 设计TCT框架，包括主分割头(MSH)和多个辅助任务头(ATHs)，通过一致性约束利用未标注解剖结构，采用筛选策略排除低一致性数据，使用统一辅助不确定性权重损失(UAUWL)减轻特定任务占主的问题

Result: 在8个来自不同临床机构的腹部数据集上进行广泛实验，证明了方法的有效性

Conclusion: TCT框架能够有效解决部分标注数据集中的类别不平衡问题，无需额外模型且避免了标签噪声的影响

Abstract: Versatile medical image segmentation (VMIS) targets the segmentation of
multiple classes, while obtaining full annotations for all classes is often
impractical due to the time and labor required. Leveraging partially labeled
datasets (PLDs) presents a promising alternative; however, current VMIS
approaches face significant class imbalance due to the unequal category
distribution in PLDs. Existing methods attempt to address this by generating
pseudo-full labels. Nevertheless, these typically require additional models and
often result in potential performance degradation from label noise. In this
work, we introduce a Task Consistency Training (TCT) framework to address class
imbalance without requiring extra models. TCT includes a backbone network with
a main segmentation head (MSH) for multi-channel predictions and multiple
auxiliary task heads (ATHs) for task-specific predictions. By enforcing a
consistency constraint between the MSH and ATH predictions, TCT effectively
utilizes unlabeled anatomical structures. To avoid error propagation from
low-consistency, potentially noisy data, we propose a filtering strategy to
exclude such data. Additionally, we introduce a unified auxiliary
uncertainty-weighted loss (UAUWL) to mitigate segmentation quality declines
caused by the dominance of specific tasks. Extensive experiments on eight
abdominal datasets from diverse clinical sites demonstrate our approach's
effectiveness.

*Dharsan Ravindran,Kevin Wang,Zhuoyuan Cao,Saleh Abdelrahman,Jeffery Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出两种不确定性感知方法来增强SAM和SAM2在恶劣天气条件下的分割鲁棒性：为SAM2设计多步微调程序引入不确定性损失函数，以及将医学影像中的UAT适配器应用于自动驾驶场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉基础模型（如SAM和SAM2）在视觉模糊度高的恶劣天气条件下表现不佳，缺乏不确定性量化能力，而自动驾驶在安全关键场景中需要更可靠的分割结果。

Method: 1）为SAM2设计多步微调程序，将不确定性指标直接纳入损失函数；2）将医学影像中的不确定性感知适配器（UAT）适配到自动驾驶场景。

Result: 在CamVid、BDD100K和GTA驾驶数据集上的实验表明，UAT-SAM在极端天气条件下优于标准SAM，而带有不确定性感知损失的SAM2在不同驾驶场景中均获得性能提升。

Conclusion: 显式的不确定性建模对于在挑战性环境中实现安全关键的自动驾驶具有重要价值，不确定性感知方法能显著提升分割模型在恶劣天气条件下的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Recent advances in vision foundation models, such as the Segment Anything
Model (SAM) and its successor SAM2, have achieved state-of-the-art performance
on general image segmentation benchmarks. However, these models struggle in
adverse weather conditions where visual ambiguity is high, largely due to their
lack of uncertainty quantification. Inspired by progress in medical imaging,
where uncertainty-aware training has improved reliability in ambiguous cases,
we investigate two approaches to enhance segmentation robustness for autonomous
driving. First, we introduce a multi-step finetuning procedure for SAM2 that
incorporates uncertainty metrics directly into the loss function, improving
overall scene recognition. Second, we adapt the Uncertainty-Aware Adapter
(UAT), originally designed for medical image segmentation, to driving contexts.
We evaluate both methods on CamVid, BDD100K, and GTA driving datasets.
Experiments show that UAT-SAM outperforms standard SAM in extreme weather,
while SAM2 with uncertainty-aware loss achieves improved performance across
diverse driving scenes. These findings underscore the value of explicit
uncertainty modeling for safety-critical autonomous driving in challenging
environments.

Conclusion: WatchHAR实现了智能手表作为独立、隐私感知、最小侵入性的连续活动跟踪设备的潜力，推动了设备端活动识别技术的发展。

Abstract: Despite advances in practical and multimodal fine-grained Human Activity
Recognition (HAR), a system that runs entirely on smartwatches in unconstrained
environments remains elusive. We present WatchHAR, an audio and inertial-based
HAR system that operates fully on smartwatches, addressing privacy and latency
issues associated with external data processing. By optimizing each component
of the pipeline, WatchHAR achieves compounding performance gains. We introduce
a novel architecture that unifies sensor data preprocessing and inference into
an end-to-end trainable module, achieving 5x faster processing while
maintaining over 90% accuracy across more than 25 activity classes. WatchHAR
outperforms state-of-the-art models for event detection and activity
classification while running directly on the smartwatch, achieving 9.3 ms
processing time for activity event detection and 11.8 ms for multimodal
activity classification. This research advances on-device activity recognition,
realizing smartwatches' potential as standalone, privacy-aware, and
minimally-invasive continuous activity tracking devices.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MCANet是一个用于飓风后损害评估的多标签分类框架，通过多尺度特征学习和类别特异性注意力机制，在RescueNet数据集上达到91.75%的mAP，优于多个基准模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CNN方法难以捕捉多尺度空间特征，且难以区分视觉相似或共现的损害类型，需要更精确的飓风后损害评估方法。

Method: 提出MCANet框架：使用Res2Net分层骨干网络学习多尺度表示，采用多头类别特异性残差注意力模块，每个注意力分支关注不同空间粒度，平衡局部细节和全局上下文。

Result: 在RescueNet数据集（4,494张无人机图像）上达到91.75% mAP，优于ResNet、Res2Net、VGG等模型。使用8个注意力头时性能提升至92.35%，对Road Blocked等困难类别的AP提升超过6%。

Conclusion: MCANet能够准确定位损害相关区域，支持可解释性，可用于灾后风险制图、应急路由等应用。未来可整合灾害知识图谱和多模态大语言模型提升适应性。

Abstract: Rapid and accurate post-hurricane damage assessment is vital for disaster
response and recovery. Yet existing CNN-based methods struggle to capture
multi-scale spatial features and to distinguish visually similar or
co-occurring damage types. To address these issues, we propose MCANet, a
multi-label classification framework that learns multi-scale representations
and adaptively attends to spatially relevant regions for each damage category.
MCANet employs a Res2Net-based hierarchical backbone to enrich spatial context
across scales and a multi-head class-specific residual attention module to
enhance discrimination. Each attention branch focuses on different spatial
granularities, balancing local detail with global context. We evaluate MCANet
on the RescueNet dataset of 4,494 UAV images collected after Hurricane Michael.
MCANet achieves a mean average precision (mAP) of 91.75%, outperforming ResNet,
Res2Net, VGG, MobileNet, EfficientNet, and ViT. With eight attention heads,
performance further improves to 92.35%, boosting average precision for
challenging classes such as Road Blocked by over 6%. Class activation mapping
confirms MCANet's ability to localize damage-relevant regions, supporting
interpretability. Outputs from MCANet can inform post-disaster risk mapping,
emergency routing, and digital twin-based disaster response. Future work could
integrate disaster-specific knowledge graphs and multimodal large language
models to improve adaptability to unseen disasters and enrich semantic
understanding for real-world decision-making.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种动态视频中人群检测方法，结合视觉-语言模型和全局优化，能够检测动态变化的人群结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 检测复杂人群需要考虑不仅是局部外观特征，还需要全局场景上下文，同时确保时间上的组织结构一致性。但以前的方法假设视频中群体不变，无法处理动态变化的情况。

Method: 使用组织检测增强的Vision-Language Model(VLM)提取每帧的局部和全局特征，然后通过全局优化图设计来确保时间上的组织结构一致性，能够处理动态变化的群体。

Result: 在公开数据集上，该方法的性能超过了现有的最先进组织检测方法。

Conclusion: 该方法通过结合VLM特征提取和全局优化，成功地解决了动态人群检测的挑战，为视频中复杂人群分析提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: This paper proposes dynamic human group detection in videos. For detecting
complex groups, not only the local appearance features of in-group members but
also the global context of the scene are important. Such local and global
appearance features in each frame are extracted using a Vision-Language Model
(VLM) augmented for group detection in our method. For further improvement, the
group structure should be consistent over time. While previous methods are
stabilized on the assumption that groups are not changed in a video, our method
detects dynamically changing groups by global optimization using a graph with
all frames' groupness probabilities estimated by our groupness-augmented CLIP
features. Our experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms
state-of-the-art group detection methods on public datasets. Code:

TL;DR: FloodVision是一个零样本洪水深度估计框架，结合GPT-4o视觉语言模型和结构化知识图谱，通过识别参考物体和统计过滤实现准确泛化的洪水深度测量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有计算机视觉方法在洪水检测中存在精度限制和泛化能力差的问题，需要依赖固定物体检测器和任务特定训练，无法适应多样化的洪水场景

Method: 结合GPT-4o的语义推理能力和结构化知识图谱，动态识别RGB图像中的参考物体，检索已验证的高度信息，估计淹没比例，并应用统计异常值过滤计算最终深度值

Result: 在110张MyCoast New York众包图像上评估，平均绝对误差8.17厘米，比GPT-4o基线降低20.5%，优于之前的CNN方法，具有良好的场景泛化能力和近实时操作性能

Conclusion: FloodVision为零样本洪水深度估计提供了有效解决方案，适合集成到数字孪生平台和公民报告应用中，增强智慧城市的洪水韧性

Abstract: Timely and accurate floodwater depth estimation is critical for road
accessibility and emergency response. While recent computer vision methods have
enabled flood detection, they suffer from both accuracy limitations and poor
generalization due to dependence on fixed object detectors and task-specific
training. To enable accurate depth estimation that can generalize across
diverse flood scenarios, this paper presents FloodVision, a zero-shot framework
that combines the semantic reasoning abilities of the foundation
vision-language model GPT-4o with a structured domain knowledge graph. The
knowledge graph encodes canonical real-world dimensions for common urban
objects including vehicles, people, and infrastructure elements to ground the
model's reasoning in physical reality. FloodVision dynamically identifies
visible reference objects in RGB images, retrieves verified heights from the
knowledge graph to mitigate hallucination, estimates submergence ratios, and
applies statistical outlier filtering to compute final depth values. Evaluated
on 110 crowdsourced images from MyCoast New York, FloodVision achieves a mean
absolute error of 8.17 cm, reducing the GPT-4o baseline 10.28 cm by 20.5% and
surpassing prior CNN-based methods. The system generalizes well across varying
scenes and operates in near real-time, making it suitable for future
integration into digital twin platforms and citizen-reporting apps for smart
city flood resilience.

Motivation: 解决现有Two-Tower框架效果低和Single-Tower框架效率低的问题，探索结合两者优势的混合框架

Method: 提出PIG方法，包含伪查询生成器为每个视频生成伪查询，使视频特征和文本特征在细粒度层面交互，在推理阶段不增加额外开销

Result: 在五个常用基准测试上R@1指标提升1.6%~3.9%，效率与Two-Tower模型相当，性能接近最先进水平

Conclusion: 混合塔框架成功结合了两种传统框架的优势，在文本-视频检索任务中实现了效果和效率的双重提升

Abstract: The Text-to-Video Retrieval (T2VR) task aims to retrieve unlabeled videos by
textual queries with the same semantic meanings. Recent CLIP-based approaches
have explored two frameworks: Two-Tower versus Single-Tower framework, yet the
former suffers from low effectiveness, while the latter suffers from low
efficiency. In this study, we explore a new Hybrid-Tower framework that can
hybridize the advantages of the Two-Tower and Single-Tower framework, achieving
high effectiveness and efficiency simultaneously. We propose a novel hybrid
method, Fine-grained Pseudo-query Interaction and Generation for T2VR, ie, PIG,
which includes a new pseudo-query generator designed to generate a pseudo-query
for each video. This enables the video feature and the textual features of
pseudo-query to interact in a fine-grained manner, similar to the Single-Tower
approaches to hold high effectiveness, even before the real textual query is
received. Simultaneously, our method introduces no additional storage or
computational overhead compared to the Two-Tower framework during the inference
stage, thus maintaining high efficiency. Extensive experiments on five commonly
used text-video retrieval benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves a
significant improvement over the baseline, with an increase of $1.6\% \sim
3.9\%$ in R@1. Furthermore, our method matches the efficiency of Two-Tower
models while achieving near state-of-the-art performance, highlighting the
advantages of the Hybrid-Tower framework.

Motivation: 月球探测需要精确的图像配准来进行表面测绘、资源定位和任务规划，但不同传感器（光学、高光谱、雷达）获取的图像存在分辨率、光照和畸变差异，配准具有挑战性。

Method: 使用SIFT、ASIFT、AKAZE、RIFT2和SuperGlue五种特征匹配算法，对赤道和极区区域的跨模态图像对进行测试，并提出了包括地理参考、分辨率对齐、强度归一化以及自适应直方图均衡、主成分分析和阴影校正的预处理流程。

Result: SuperGlue始终产生最低的均方根误差和最快的运行时间。传统方法如SIFT和AKAZE在赤道附近表现良好，但在极区光照条件下性能下降。

Conclusion: 预处理和学习型方法对于在不同条件下实现鲁棒的月球图像配准至关重要，深度学习算法在跨模态月球图像配准中显示出显著优势。

Abstract: Accurate image registration is critical for lunar exploration, enabling
surface mapping, resource localization, and mission planning. Aligning data
from diverse lunar sensors -- optical (e.g., Orbital High Resolution Camera,
Narrow and Wide Angle Cameras), hyperspectral (Imaging Infrared Spectrometer),
and radar (e.g., Dual-Frequency Synthetic Aperture Radar, Selene/Kaguya
mission) -- is challenging due to differences in resolution, illumination, and
sensor distortion. We evaluate five feature matching algorithms: SIFT, ASIFT,
AKAZE, RIFT2, and SuperGlue (a deep learning-based matcher), using
cross-modality image pairs from equatorial and polar regions. A preprocessing
pipeline is proposed, including georeferencing, resolution alignment, intensity
normalization, and enhancements like adaptive histogram equalization, principal
component analysis, and shadow correction. SuperGlue consistently yields the
lowest root mean square error and fastest runtimes. Classical methods such as
SIFT and AKAZE perform well near the equator but degrade under polar lighting.
The results highlight the importance of preprocessing and learning-based
approaches for robust lunar image registration across diverse conditions.

Abstract: Skin diseases are among the most prevalent health concerns worldwide, yet
conventional diagnostic methods are often costly, complex, and unavailable in
low-resource settings. Automated classification using deep learning has emerged
as a promising alternative, but existing studies are mostly limited to
dermoscopic datasets and a narrow range of disease classes. In this work, we
curate a large dataset of over 50 skin disease categories captured with mobile
devices, making it more representative of real-world conditions. We evaluate
multiple convolutional neural networks and Transformer-based architectures,
demonstrating that Transformer models, particularly the Swin Transformer,
achieve superior performance by effectively capturing global contextual
features. To enhance interpretability, we incorporate Gradient-weighted Class
Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM), which highlights clinically relevant regions and
provides transparency in model predictions. Our results underscore the
potential of Transformer-based approaches for mobile-acquired skin lesion
classification, paving the way toward accessible AI-assisted dermatological

Conclusion: 混合专家模型能够在不修改架构的情况下提取良好校准的预测不确定性估计，在不确定性量化方面优于传统集成方法，为安全关键应用提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Estimating accurate and well-calibrated predictive uncertainty is important
for enhancing the reliability of computer vision models, especially in
safety-critical applications like traffic scene perception. While ensemble
methods are commonly used to quantify uncertainty by combining multiple models,
a mixture of experts (MoE) offers an efficient alternative by leveraging a
gating network to dynamically weight expert predictions based on the input.
Building on the promising use of MoEs for semantic segmentation in our previous
works, we show that well-calibrated predictive uncertainty estimates can be
extracted from MoEs without architectural modifications. We investigate three
methods to extract predictive uncertainty estimates: predictive entropy, mutual
information, and expert variance. We evaluate these methods for an MoE with two
experts trained on a semantical split of the A2D2 dataset. Our results show
that MoEs yield more reliable uncertainty estimates than ensembles in terms of
conditional correctness metrics under out-of-distribution (OOD) data.
Additionally, we evaluate routing uncertainty computed via gate entropy and
find that simple gating mechanisms lead to better calibration of routing
uncertainty estimates than more complex classwise gates. Finally, our
experiments on the Cityscapes dataset suggest that increasing the number of
experts can further enhance uncertainty calibration. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前Mamba方法在复杂光场数据上存在的多方向扫描效率低下和特征提取冗余问题，以及状态空间在保体空间-角度和视差信息方面的限制

Method: 提出Subspace Simple Scanning策略和Subspace Simple Mamba Block，构建双阶段建模策略：第一阶段用SA-RSMB进行浅层空间-角度特征提取，第二阶段用EPMB和EPTB双分支平行结构进行深层极线特征精炼

Result: LFMT在真实和合成光场数据集上都显著超过当前最先进方法，在保持低计算复杂度的同时实现了性能的实质提升

Conclusion: 通过结合Mamba和Transformer优势的混合框架，能够在空间、角度和极线平面领域进行全面的信息探索，为光场图像超分辨率提供了高效的解决方案

Abstract: Recently, Mamba-based methods, with its advantage in long-range information
modeling and linear complexity, have shown great potential in optimizing both
computational cost and performance of light field image super-resolution
(LFSR). However, current multi-directional scanning strategies lead to
inefficient and redundant feature extraction when applied to complex LF data.
To overcome this challenge, we propose a Subspace Simple Scanning (Sub-SS)
strategy, based on which we design the Subspace Simple Mamba Block (SSMB) to
achieve more efficient and precise feature extraction. Furthermore, we propose
a dual-stage modeling strategy to address the limitation of state space in
preserving spatial-angular and disparity information, thereby enabling a more
comprehensive exploration of non-local spatial-angular correlations.
Specifically, in stage I, we introduce the Spatial-Angular Residual Subspace
Mamba Block (SA-RSMB) for shallow spatial-angular feature extraction; in stage
II, we use a dual-branch parallel structure combining the Epipolar Plane Mamba
Block (EPMB) and Epipolar Plane Transformer Block (EPTB) for deep epipolar
feature refinement. Building upon meticulously designed modules and strategies,
we introduce a hybrid Mamba-Transformer framework, termed LFMT. LFMT integrates
the strengths of Mamba and Transformer models for LFSR, enabling comprehensive
information exploration across spatial, angular, and epipolar-plane domains.
Experimental results demonstrate that LFMT significantly outperforms current
state-of-the-art methods in LFSR, achieving substantial improvements in
performance while maintaining low computational complexity on both real-word
and synthetic LF datasets.

Motivation: 现有端到端视觉定位方法仅依赖参考目标监督，忽略了潜在前景目标的益处，且缺乏多粒度判别能力，在复杂场景中目标识别不够鲁棒。

Method: 提出PropVG框架，包含对比参考评分(CRS)模块（句子和词汇级对比学习）和多粒度目标判别(MTD)模块（融合对象和语义级信息）。

Result: 在gRefCOCO、Ref-ZOM、R-RefCOCO和RefCOCO等多个基准测试上验证了有效性。

Conclusion: PropVG成功解决了现有方法的局限性，通过整合proposal生成和目标理解，结合对比学习和多粒度判别，显著提升了视觉定位性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in visual grounding have largely shifted away from
traditional proposal-based two-stage frameworks due to their inefficiency and
high computational complexity, favoring end-to-end direct reference paradigms.
However, these methods rely exclusively on the referred target for supervision,
overlooking the potential benefits of prominent prospective targets. Moreover,
existing approaches often fail to incorporate multi-granularity discrimination,
which is crucial for robust object identification in complex scenarios. To
address these limitations, we propose PropVG, an end-to-end proposal-based
framework that, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to seamlessly
integrate foreground object proposal generation with referential object
comprehension without requiring additional detectors. Furthermore, we introduce
a Contrastive-based Refer Scoring (CRS) module, which employs contrastive
learning at both sentence and word levels to enhance the capability in
understanding and distinguishing referred objects. Additionally, we design a
Multi-granularity Target Discrimination (MTD) module that fuses object- and
semantic-level information to improve the recognition of absent targets.
Extensive experiments on gRefCOCO (GREC/GRES), Ref-ZOM, R-RefCOCO, and RefCOCO
(REC/RES) benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of PropVG. The codes and

Abstract: Understanding the complex combustion dynamics within scramjet engines is
critical for advancing high-speed propulsion technologies. However, the large
scale and high dimensionality of simulation-generated temporal flow field data
present significant challenges for visual interpretation, feature
differentiation, and cross-case comparison. In this paper, we present
TemporalFlowViz, a parameter-aware visual analytics workflow and system
designed to support expert-driven clustering, visualization, and interpretation
of temporal flow fields from scramjet combustion simulations. Our approach
leverages hundreds of simulated combustion cases with varying initial
conditions, each producing time-sequenced flow field images. We use pretrained
Vision Transformers to extract high-dimensional embeddings from these frames,
apply dimensionality reduction and density-based clustering to uncover latent
combustion modes, and construct temporal trajectories in the embedding space to
track the evolution of each simulation over time. To bridge the gap between
latent representations and expert reasoning, domain specialists annotate
representative cluster centroids with descriptive labels. These annotations are
used as contextual prompts for a vision-language model, which generates
natural-language summaries for individual frames and full simulation cases. The
system also supports parameter-based filtering, similarity-based case

TL;DR: OmniFHT是一个无姿态约束的3D折射率重建框架，通过傅里叶衍射定理和隐式神经表示，实现了高通量流式细胞术中对任意形状细胞的多轴旋转成像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前3D定量相位成像方法假设细胞进行均匀单轴旋转，限制了只能分析近球形细胞，无法准确成像不规则形状细胞的复杂旋转，导致只能分析细胞群体的子集。

Method: 利用傅里叶衍射定理和隐式神经表示(INRs)，通过联合优化每个细胞的未知旋转轨迹和体积结构，在弱散射假设下支持任意细胞几何形状和多轴旋转。

Result: 能够从稀疏采样投影和有限角度覆盖中实现准确重建，仅需10个视图或120度角度范围即可获得高保真结果。

Conclusion: OmniFHT首次实现了对整个流动细胞群体的原位高通量断层成像，为流式细胞术平台提供了可扩展且无偏见的无标记形态计量分析解决方案。

Abstract: High-throughput 3D quantitative phase imaging (QPI) in flow cytometry enables
label-free, volumetric characterization of individual cells by reconstructing
their refractive index (RI) distributions from multiple viewing angles during
flow through microfluidic channels. However, current imaging methods assume
that cells undergo uniform, single-axis rotation, which require their poses to
be known at each frame. This assumption restricts applicability to
near-spherical cells and prevents accurate imaging of irregularly shaped cells
with complex rotations. As a result, only a subset of the cellular population
can be analyzed, limiting the ability of flow-based assays to perform robust
statistical analysis. We introduce OmniFHT, a pose-free 3D RI reconstruction
framework that leverages the Fourier diffraction theorem and implicit neural
representations (INRs) for high-throughput flow cytometry tomographic imaging.
By jointly optimizing each cell's unknown rotational trajectory and volumetric
structure under weak scattering assumptions, OmniFHT supports arbitrary cell
geometries and multi-axis rotations. Its continuous representation also allows
accurate reconstruction from sparsely sampled projections and restricted
angular coverage, producing high-fidelity results with as few as 10 views or
only 120 degrees of angular range. OmniFHT enables, for the first time, in
situ, high-throughput tomographic imaging of entire flowing cell populations,
providing a scalable and unbiased solution for label-free morphometric analysis
in flow cytometry platforms.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoRe-GS是一种用于移动自主空中机器人的语义3D高斯编辑方法，通过粗分割和颜色过滤来快速隔离感兴趣对象，减少训练时间约25%，同时保持高质量重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 移动自主机器人应用（如远程指导和灾难响应）需要准确的3D重建和快速场景处理。传统方法重建整个场景效率低下，而关注特定感兴趣对象（PoIs）更为高效。

Method: 首先使用语义高斯分割生成粗分割场景，然后通过新颖的基于颜色的有效过滤方法对语义对象进行精炼，实现有效的对象隔离。

Result: 在两个数据集（SCRREAM真实户外和NeRDS 360合成室内）上评估，显示运行时间减少，新视角合成质量提高，训练时间比完整语义高斯训练周期减少约四分之一。

Conclusion: CoRe-GS方法在保持高质量3D重建的同时显著减少了训练时间，为移动机器人应用提供了高效的语义场景编辑解决方案。

Abstract: Mobile reconstruction for autonomous aerial robotics holds strong potential
for critical applications such as tele-guidance and disaster response. These
tasks demand both accurate 3D reconstruction and fast scene processing. Instead
of reconstructing the entire scene in detail, it is often more efficient to
focus on specific objects, i.e., points of interest (PoIs). Mobile robots
equipped with advanced sensing can usually detect these early during data
acquisition or preliminary analysis, reducing the need for full-scene
optimization. Gaussian Splatting (GS) has recently shown promise in delivering
high-quality novel view synthesis and 3D representation by an incremental
learning process. Extending GS with scene editing, semantics adds useful
per-splat features to isolate objects effectively.
  Semantic 3D Gaussian editing can already be achieved before the full training
cycle is completed, reducing the overall training time. Moreover, the
semantically relevant area, the PoI, is usually already known during capturing.
To balance high-quality reconstruction with reduced training time, we propose
CoRe-GS. We first generate a coarse segmentation-ready scene with semantic GS
and then refine it for the semantic object using our novel color-based
effective filtering for effective object isolation. This is speeding up the
training process to be about a quarter less than a full training cycle for
semantic GS. We evaluate our approach on two datasets, SCRREAM (real-world,
outdoor) and NeRDS 360 (synthetic, indoor), showing reduced runtime and higher
novel-view-synthesis quality.

TL;DR: Cryo-RL是一个基于强化学习的冷冻消融针放置规划框架，通过模拟临床环境和奖励函数优化，实现了与人类专家相当的性能，同时大幅减少规划时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前前列腺癌冷冻消融治疗的手术前规划依赖人工经验，耗时且结果不一致，需要自动化解决方案来提高治疗质量和可扩展性。

Method: 将冷冻消融规划建模为马尔可夫决策过程，在模拟环境中通过强化学习代理顺序选择冷冻消融针位置和冰球直径，基于肿瘤覆盖率的奖励函数指导学习最优策略。

Result: 在583个回顾性前列腺癌病例上评估，Cryo-RL相比最佳自动化基线方法Dice系数提升超过8个百分点，达到人类专家水平，且规划时间显著减少。

Conclusion: 强化学习能够提供临床可行、可重复且高效的冷冻消融规划方案，具有重要的临床应用潜力。

Abstract: Cryoablation is a minimally invasive localised treatment for prostate cancer
that destroys malignant tissue during de-freezing, while sparing surrounding
healthy structures. Its success depends on accurate preoperative planning of
cryoprobe placements to fully cover the tumour and avoid critical anatomy. This
planning is currently manual, expertise-dependent, and time-consuming, leading
to variability in treatment quality and limited scalability. In this work, we
introduce Cryo-RL, a reinforcement learning framework that models cryoablation
planning as a Markov decision process and learns an optimal policy for
cryoprobe placement. Within a simulated environment that models clinical
constraints and stochastic intraoperative variability, an agent sequentially
selects cryoprobe positions and ice sphere diameters. Guided by a reward
function based on tumour coverage, this agent learns a cryoablation strategy
that leads to optimal cryoprobe placements without the need for any
manually-designed plans. Evaluated on 583 retrospective prostate cancer cases,
Cryo-RL achieved over 8 percentage-point Dice improvements compared with the
best automated baselines, based on geometric optimisation, and matched human
expert performance while requiring substantially less planning time. These
results highlight the potential of reinforcement learning to deliver clinically
viable, reproducible, and efficient cryoablation plans.

Result: 模型平均MAE在10.1-11.0之间，学习曲线分析显示数据集大小影响性能，可解释性评估显示模型基于蜘蛛特征做出预测，远视图和人工蜘蛛图片错误较高

Conclusion: 证明了可解释性计算机视觉模型在恐惧预测中的潜力，强调了模型可解释性和足够数据集对开发有效情感感知治疗技术的重要性

Abstract: Advances in computer vision have opened new avenues for clinical
applications, particularly in computerized exposure therapy where visual
stimuli can be dynamically adjusted based on patient responses. As a critical
step toward such adaptive systems, we investigated whether pretrained computer
vision models can accurately predict fear levels from spider-related images. We
adapted three diverse models using transfer learning to predict human fear
ratings (on a 0-100 scale) from a standardized dataset of 313 images. The
models were evaluated using cross-validation, achieving an average mean
absolute error (MAE) between 10.1 and 11.0. Our learning curve analysis
revealed that reducing the dataset size significantly harmed performance,
though further increases yielded no substantial gains. Explainability
assessments showed the models' predictions were based on spider-related
features. A category-wise error analysis further identified visual conditions
associated with higher errors (e.g., distant views and artificial/painted
spiders). These findings demonstrate the potential of explainable computer
vision models in predicting fear ratings, highlighting the importance of both
model explainability and a sufficient dataset size for developing effective
emotion-aware therapeutic technologies.

Motivation: 工业撅据检测对预测性维护至关重要，但真实数据收集成本高、耗时长，且缺乏多种撅据场景的数据集

Method: 结合视觉语言模型和3D模拟渗染引擎，生成不同锈蚀条件下的合成数据

Result: 使用合成数据训练的锈蚀检测模型在实际工业物体图像上达到了0.87 mAP50指标，性能超过其他方法

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了工业撅据检测数据缺乏问题，具有可自定义性并可扩展到其他工业撅据检测场景

Abstract: We propose an approach to generate synthetic data to train computer vision
(CV) models for industrial wear and tear detection. Wear and tear detection is
an important CV problem for predictive maintenance tasks in any industry.
However, data curation for training such models is expensive and time-consuming
due to the unavailability of datasets for different wear and tear scenarios.
Our approach employs a vision language model along with a 3D simulation and
rendering engine to generate synthetic data for varying rust conditions. We
evaluate our approach by training a CV model for rust detection using the
generated dataset and tested the trained model on real images of rusted
industrial objects. The model trained with the synthetic data generated by our
approach, outperforms the other approaches with a mAP50 score of 0.87. The
approach is customizable and can be easily extended to other industrial wear
and tear detection scenarios

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种简单的注意力基础多实例学习框架，用于自动化皮腺细胞图像中的液滴计数，对比了基线MLP模型和注意力MIL模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动计数皮腺细胞中的液滴耗时费力且主观，需要自动化解决方案来提高效率和准确性。

Method: 使用Nile Red染色的皮腺细胞图像，按液滴数量分为14个类别，通过数据增广扩展到约50,000个细胞。对比了基于聚合片层计数的MLP模型和使用ResNet-50特征的注意力MIL模型。

Result: 五折交叉验证显示，基线MLP模型表现更稳定（平均MAE=5.6），注意力MIL模型不如其稳定（平均MAE=10.7）但在某些折叠中更优。

Conclusion: 简单的包级聚合提供了健壃的基线方法，而注意力MIL需要任务对齐的池化和正则化才能充分发挥其潜力。

Abstract: Sebocytes are lipid-secreting cells whose differentiation is marked by the
accumulation of intracellular lipid droplets, making their quantification a key
readout in sebocyte biology. Manual counting is labor-intensive and subjective,
motivating automated solutions. Here, we introduce a simple attention-based
multiple instance learning (MIL) framework for sebocyte image analysis. Nile
Red-stained sebocyte images were annotated into 14 classes according to droplet
counts, expanded via data augmentation to about 50,000 cells. Two models were
benchmarked: a baseline multi-layer perceptron (MLP) trained on aggregated
patch-level counts, and an attention-based MIL model leveraging ResNet-50
features with instance weighting. Experiments using five-fold cross-validation
showed that the baseline MLP achieved more stable performance (mean MAE = 5.6)
compared with the attention-based MIL, which was less consistent (mean MAE =
10.7) but occasionally superior in specific folds. These findings indicate that
simple bag-level aggregation provides a robust baseline for slide-level droplet
counting, while attention-based MIL requires task-aligned pooling and
regularization to fully realize its potential in sebocyte image analysis.

Motivation: 单图像新视角合成任务由于未观察区域存在多种解释而高度不适定，现有方法往往基于模糊先验和输入视图附近的插值生成未见区域，导致严重失真。

Method: 构建检索和增强系统，利用多模态大语言模型选择合适参考图像；引入即插即用的适配器模块和多级隔离层动态生成目标视图的参考特征；设计解耦三重注意力机制有效对齐和整合多分支特征。

Result: 大量实验表明，UniView显著提升了新视角合成性能，在具有挑战性的数据集上优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: 通过利用相似物体的参考图像提供强先验信息，UniView有效解决了单图像新视角合成中的失真问题，为这一领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: The task of synthesizing novel views from a single image is highly ill-posed
due to multiple explanations for unobserved areas. Most current methods tend to
generate unseen regions from ambiguity priors and interpolation near input
views, which often lead to severe distortions. To address this limitation, we
propose a novel model dubbed as UniView, which can leverage reference images
from a similar object to provide strong prior information during view
synthesis. More specifically, we construct a retrieval and augmentation system
and employ a multimodal large language model (MLLM) to assist in selecting
reference images that meet our requirements. Additionally, a plug-and-play
adapter module with multi-level isolation layers is introduced to dynamically
generate reference features for the target views. Moreover, in order to
preserve the details of an original input image, we design a decoupled triple
attention mechanism, which can effectively align and integrate multi-branch
features into the synthesis process. Extensive experiments have demonstrated
that our UniView significantly improves novel view synthesis performance and
outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the challenging datasets.

TL;DR: MFM-Mapper是一个高效的多基础模型映射器，通过融合双视觉编码器特征和使用GPT-2替代线性映射器，显著提升了视频到音频生成的语义和时间一致性，同时大幅降低了训练成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视频到音频生成方法需要大量资源从头训练，而利用基础模型进行跨模态知识迁移可以提升效率。受到先前轻量级映射器工作的启发，希望开发更高效的映射方法。

Method: 提出MFM-Mapper方法：1）使用双视觉编码器融合更丰富的语义和时间特征；2）用GPT-2替代线性映射器，将跨模态特征映射视为自回归翻译任务；3）保持训练高效性。

Result: 仅需先前映射器方法16%的训练规模，就能达到竞争性性能。在语义和时间一致性方面表现更好，训练效率显著提升。

Conclusion: MFM-Mapper通过创新的多基础模型融合和GPT-2映射架构，实现了高效且高性能的视频到音频生成，为跨模态生成任务提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent Video-to-Audio (V2A) generation relies on extracting semantic and
temporal features from video to condition generative models. Training these
models from scratch is resource intensive. Consequently, leveraging foundation
models (FMs) has gained traction due to their cross-modal knowledge transfer
and generalization capabilities. One prior work has explored fine-tuning a
lightweight mapper network to connect a pre-trained visual encoder with a
text-to-audio generation model for V2A. Inspired by this, we introduce the
Multiple Foundation Model Mapper (MFM-Mapper). Compared to the previous mapper
approach, MFM-Mapper benefits from richer semantic and temporal information by
fusing features from dual visual encoders. Furthermore, by replacing a linear
mapper with GPT-2, MFM-Mapper improves feature alignment, drawing parallels
between cross-modal features mapping and autoregressive translation tasks. Our
MFM-Mapper exhibits remarkable training efficiency. It achieves better
performance in semantic and temporal consistency with fewer training consuming,
requiring only 16\% of the training scale compared to previous mapper-based
work, yet achieves competitive performance with models trained on a much larger
scale.

Conclusion: 该方法通过VLMs和双域联合优化，有效解决了双源退化场景下的图像融合问题，代码将在论文接受后公开

Abstract: Most existing infrared-visible image fusion (IVIF) methods assume
high-quality inputs, and therefore struggle to handle dual-source degraded
scenarios, typically requiring manual selection and sequential application of
multiple pre-enhancement steps. This decoupled pre-enhancement-to-fusion
pipeline inevitably leads to error accumulation and performance degradation. To
overcome these limitations, we propose Guided Dual-Domain Fusion (GD^2Fusion),
a novel framework that synergistically integrates vision-language models (VLMs)
for degradation perception with dual-domain (frequency/spatial) joint
optimization. Concretely, the designed Guided Frequency Modality-Specific
Extraction (GFMSE) module performs frequency-domain degradation perception and
suppression and discriminatively extracts fusion-relevant sub-band features.
Meanwhile, the Guided Spatial Modality-Aggregated Fusion (GSMAF) module carries
out cross-modal degradation filtering and adaptive multi-source feature
aggregation in the spatial domain to enhance modality complementarity and
structural consistency. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments
demonstrate that GD^2Fusion achieves superior fusion performance compared with
existing algorithms and strategies in dual-source degraded scenarios. The code
will be publicly released after acceptance of this paper.

Abstract: Breast cancer remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality among women
worldwide. Ultrasound imaging, widely used due to its safety and
cost-effectiveness, plays a key role in early detection, especially in patients
with dense breast tissue. This paper presents a comprehensive study on the
application of machine learning and deep learning techniques for breast cancer
classification using ultrasound images. Using datasets such as BUSI, BUS-BRA,
and BrEaST-Lesions USG, we evaluate classical machine learning models (SVM,
KNN) and deep convolutional neural networks (ResNet-18, EfficientNet-B0,
GoogLeNet). Experimental results show that ResNet-18 achieves the highest

models, though outperformed by CNNs, achieve competitive performance when
enhanced with deep feature extraction. Grad-CAM visualizations further improve
model transparency by highlighting diagnostically relevant image regions. These
findings support the integration of AI-based diagnostic tools into clinical

Abstract: Fast and accurate object perception in low-light traffic scenes has attracted
increasing attention. However, due to severe illumination degradation and the
lack of reliable visual cues, existing perception models and methods struggle
to quickly adapt to and accurately predict in low-light environments. Moreover,
there is the absence of available large-scale benchmark specifically focused on
low-light traffic scenes. To bridge this gap, we introduce a physically
grounded illumination degradation method tailored to real-world low-light
settings and construct Dark-traffic, the largest densely annotated dataset to
date for low-light traffic scenes, supporting object detection, instance
segmentation, and optical flow estimation. We further propose the Separable
Learning Vision Model (SLVM), a biologically inspired framework designed to
enhance perception under adverse lighting. SLVM integrates four key components:
a light-adaptive pupillary mechanism for illumination-sensitive feature
extraction, a feature-level separable learning strategy for efficient
representation, task-specific decoupled branches for multi-task separable
learning, and a spatial misalignment-aware fusion module for precise
multi-feature alignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SLVM achieves
state-of-the-art performance with reduced computational overhead. Notably, it
outperforms RT-DETR by 11.2 percentage points in detection, YOLOv12 by 6.1
percentage points in instance segmentation, and reduces endpoint error (EPE) of
baseline by 12.37% on Dark-traffic. On the LIS benchmark, the end-to-end
trained SLVM surpasses Swin Transformer+EnlightenGAN and
ConvNeXt-T+EnlightenGAN by an average of 11 percentage points across key
metrics, and exceeds Mask RCNN (with light enhancement) by 3.1 percentage
points. The Dark-traffic dataset and complete code is released at

Abstract: The study explores the integration of transfer learning (TL) with

computational requirements and dataset scarcity, this research evaluates three
TL strategies--full fine-tuning, partial fine-tuning, and training from

ShuffleNet. Experiments were conducted on three benchmark datasets: AHCD,
HIJJA, and IFHCDB. MobileNet emerged as the top-performing model, consistently
achieving superior accuracy, robustness, and efficiency, with ShuffleNet
excelling in generalization, particularly under full fine-tuning. The IFHCDB
dataset yielded the highest results, with 99% accuracy using MnasNet under full
fine-tuning, highlighting its suitability for robust character recognition. The
AHCD dataset achieved competitive accuracy (97%) with ShuffleNet, while HIJJA
posed significant challenges due to its variability, achieving a peak accuracy
of 92% with ShuffleNet. Notably, full fine-tuning demonstrated the best overall
performance, balancing accuracy and convergence speed, while partial
fine-tuning underperformed across metrics. These findings underscore the
potential of combining TL and MbNets for resource-efficient AHCR, paving the
way for further optimizations and broader applications. Future work will
explore architectural modifications, in-depth dataset feature analysis, data

Motivation: 为了解决复杂服装与任意多样化身体形状对齐的挑战，需要开发一个能够处理复杂几何、非流形网格，并能泛化到各种人形角色的自动化虚拟试穿系统。

Abstract: We present LUIVITON, an end-to-end system for fully automated virtual try-on,
capable of draping complex, multi-layer clothing onto diverse and arbitrarily
posed humanoid characters. To address the challenge of aligning complex
garments with arbitrary and highly diverse body shapes, we use SMPL as a proxy
representation and separate the clothing-to-body draping problem into two
correspondence tasks: 1) clothing-to-SMPL and 2) body-to-SMPL correspondence,
where each has its unique challenges. While we address the clothing-to-SMPL
fitting problem using a geometric learning-based approach for
partial-to-complete shape correspondence prediction, we introduce a diffusion
model-based approach for body-to-SMPL correspondence using multi-view
consistent appearance features and a pre-trained 2D foundation model. Our
method can handle complex geometries, non-manifold meshes, and generalizes
effectively to a wide range of humanoid characters -- including humans, robots,
cartoon subjects, creatures, and aliens, while maintaining computational
efficiency for practical adoption. In addition to offering a fully automatic
fitting solution, LUIVITON supports fast customization of clothing size,
allowing users to adjust clothing sizes and material properties after they have
been draped. We show that our system can produce high-quality 3D clothing
fittings without any human labor, even when 2D clothing sewing patterns are not

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ADClick是一个用于工业异常检测的交互式图像分割算法，通过少量用户点击和文本描述生成像素级异常标注，显著提升异常检测模型性能。ADClick-Seg通过跨模态框架结合视觉特征和文本提示，在多项指标上达到最先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业产品检测通常只使用正常样本训练异常检测模型，虽然有缺陷样本但需要像素级标注限制了可扩展性。需要一种能够高效生成精确标注的方法来利用缺陷样本。

Method: 提出ADClick交互式图像分割算法，通过少量用户点击和简短文本描述生成像素级异常标注。进一步提出ADClick-Seg跨模态框架，通过基于原型的方法对齐视觉特征和文本提示，结合像素级先验和语言引导线索。

Result: ADClick在MVTec AD上达到AP=96.1%的优异性能。ADClick-Seg在多类异常检测任务上取得AP=80.0%、PRO=97.5%、Pixel-AUROC=99.1%的state-of-the-art结果。

Conclusion: ADClick和ADClick-Seg通过交互式分割和跨模态融合，有效解决了工业异常检测中标注成本高的问题，显著提升了模型性能，为工业检测提供了高效精确的解决方案。

Abstract: Industrial product inspection is often performed using Anomaly Detection (AD)
frameworks trained solely on non-defective samples. Although defective samples
can be collected during production, leveraging them usually requires
pixel-level annotations, limiting scalability. To address this, we propose
ADClick, an Interactive Image Segmentation (IIS) algorithm for industrial
anomaly detection. ADClick generates pixel-wise anomaly annotations from only a
few user clicks and a brief textual description, enabling precise and efficient
labeling that significantly improves AD model performance (e.g., AP = 96.1\% on
MVTec AD). We further introduce ADClick-Seg, a cross-modal framework that
aligns visual features and textual prompts via a prototype-based approach for
anomaly detection and localization. By combining pixel-level priors with
language-guided cues, ADClick-Seg achieves state-of-the-art results on the
challenging ``Multi-class'' AD task (AP = 80.0\%, PRO = 97.5\%, Pixel-AUROC =
99.1\% on MVTec AD).

Abstract: Background: To systematically review and perform a meta-analysis of
artificial intelligence (AI)-driven methods for detecting and correcting
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) motion artifacts, assessing current
developments, effectiveness, challenges, and future research directions.
Methods: A comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted,
focusing on deep learning (DL) approaches, particularly generative models, for
the detection and correction of MRI motion artifacts. Quantitative data were
extracted regarding utilized datasets, DL architectures, and performance
metrics. Results: DL, particularly generative models, show promise for reducing
motion artifacts and improving image quality; however, limited
generalizability, reliance on paired training data, and risk of visual
distortions remain key challenges that motivate standardized datasets and
reporting. Conclusions: AI-driven methods, particularly DL generative models,
show significant potential for improving MRI image quality by effectively
addressing motion artifacts. However, critical challenges must be addressed,
including the need for comprehensive public datasets, standardized reporting
protocols for artifact levels, and more advanced, adaptable DL techniques to
reduce reliance on extensive paired datasets. Addressing these aspects could
substantially enhance MRI diagnostic accuracy, reduce healthcare costs, and
improve patient care outcomes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GeoSplat是一个几何约束优化框架，利用一阶和二阶几何先验改进高斯泼溅的整个训练流程，包括初始化、梯度更新和密集化，显著提升了性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要使用低阶几何先验（如法向量），且通过噪声敏感方法估计不可靠。需要更鲁棒的几何约束来改进高斯泼溅优化

Method: 提出GeoSplat框架，利用曲率等二阶几何量初始化高斯尺度；基于局部流形等几何结构引入高效且抗噪声的估计方法；在整个训练流程中应用几何约束

Result: 在多个数据集上的新颖视图合成实验中，GeoSplat显著提升了高斯泼溅的性能，超越了之前的基线方法

Conclusion: GeoSplat通过引入鲁棒的几何约束和二阶几何先验，有效改进了高斯泼溅的优化过程，为3D重建提供了更好的几何感知方法

Abstract: A few recent works explored incorporating geometric priors to regularize the
optimization of Gaussian splatting, further improving its performance. However,
those early studies mainly focused on the use of low-order geometric priors
(e.g., normal vector), and they are also unreliably estimated by
noise-sensitive methods, like local principal component analysis. To address
their limitations, we first present GeoSplat, a general geometry-constrained
optimization framework that exploits both first-order and second-order
geometric quantities to improve the entire training pipeline of Gaussian
splatting, including Gaussian initialization, gradient update, and
densification. As an example, we initialize the scales of 3D Gaussian
primitives in terms of principal curvatures, leading to a better coverage of
the object surface than random initialization. Secondly, based on certain
geometric structures (e.g., local manifold), we introduce efficient and
noise-robust estimation methods that provide dynamic geometric priors for our
framework. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple datasets for novel view
synthesis, showing that our framework: GeoSplat, significantly improves the
performance of Gaussian splatting and outperforms previous baselines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Scale-Interaction Transformer (SIT)混合架构，结合CNN特征提取和Transformer关系建模能力，在面部美观度预测任务上达到新SOTA，Pearson相关系数0.9187


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CNN在固定尺度处理特征，可能忽略不同粒度特征间的相互依赖关系，而面部美观度感知需要综合考虑局部和全局特征的复杂交互

Method: 使用多尺度模块并行卷积捕获不同感受野的面部特征，然后将多尺度表示作为序列输入Transformer编码器，通过自注意力机制显式建模特征间交互关系

Result: 在SCUT-FBP5500基准数据集上取得0.9187的Pearson相关系数，超越了之前的所有方法

Conclusion: 显式建模多尺度视觉线索间的交互对于高性能面部美观度预测至关重要，SIT架构展示了CNN-Transformer混合模型在需要整体上下文理解的复杂图像回归任务中的潜力

Abstract: Automated Facial Beauty Prediction (FBP) is a challenging computer vision
task due to the complex interplay of local and global facial features that
influence human perception. While Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) excel at
feature extraction, they often process information at a fixed scale,
potentially overlooking the critical inter-dependencies between features at
different levels of granularity. To address this limitation, we introduce the
Scale-Interaction Transformer (SIT), a novel hybrid deep learning architecture
that synergizes the feature extraction power of CNNs with the relational
modeling capabilities of Transformers. The SIT first employs a multi-scale
module with parallel convolutions to capture facial characteristics at varying
receptive fields. These multi-scale representations are then framed as a
sequence and processed by a Transformer encoder, which explicitly models their
interactions and contextual relationships via a self-attention mechanism. We
conduct extensive experiments on the widely-used SCUT-FBP5500 benchmark
dataset, where the proposed SIT model establishes a new state-of-the-art. It
achieves a Pearson Correlation of 0.9187, outperforming previous methods. Our
findings demonstrate that explicitly modeling the interplay between multi-scale
visual cues is crucial for high-performance FBP. The success of the SIT
architecture highlights the potential of hybrid CNN-Transformer models for
complex image regression tasks that demand a holistic, context-aware
understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 通过在ResNet深层注入稀疏混合专家(MoE)层，在不增加推理成本的情况下提升了模型对对抗性攻击的鲁棒性，并发现专家专门化形成了更鲁棒的子路径。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决卷积神经网络对对抗性攻击的脆弱性，并找到一种资源效率高的稳健化方法。

Method: 在ResNet深层模块中插入稀疏MoE层，结合对抗性训练，使用切换损失进行平衡，在CIFAR-100数据集上进行实验。

Result: 在PGD和AutoPGD攻击下模型鲁棒性持续提升，路由冲击导致专家专门化，部分个体专家甚至超过门控MoE模型的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 稀疏MoE结构能够在不增加推理成本的情况下提升模型鲁棒性，通过专家专门化形成更鲁棒的子路径。

Abstract: Robustifying convolutional neural networks (CNNs) against adversarial attacks
remains challenging and often requires resource-intensive countermeasures. We
explore the use of sparse mixture-of-experts (MoE) layers to improve robustness
by replacing selected residual blocks or convolutional layers, thereby
increasing model capacity without additional inference cost. On ResNet
architectures trained on CIFAR-100, we find that inserting a single MoE layer
in the deeper stages leads to consistent improvements in robustness under PGD
and AutoPGD attacks when combined with adversarial training. Furthermore, we
discover that when switch loss is used for balancing, it causes routing to
collapse onto a small set of overused experts, thereby concentrating
adversarial training on these paths and inadvertently making them more robust.
As a result, some individual experts outperform the gated MoE model in
robustness, suggesting that robust subpaths emerge through specialization. Our
code is available at https://github.com/KASTEL-MobilityLab/robust-sparse-moes.

TL;DR: CRAFT是一个用于回归任务的源自由半监督域适应框架，在神经科学数据上相比微调模型提升9% RMSE，优于现有方法3%以上


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现实应用中源数据不可用、目标标签稀缺且输出为连续值的挑战，特别是在隐私敏感或计算资源受限的医学场景

Method: 基于Contradistinguisher框架，开发源自由半监督训练方法，无需中间表示对齐，直接利用预训练模型和未标记目标数据

Result: 在EEG注视预测和MRI脑龄预测任务中，RMSE提升达9%；在两个真实回归基准测试中均优于4种最先进的源自由域适应方法3%以上

Conclusion: CRAFT是生物学和医学中普遍存在的回归任务的高效源自由半监督深度迁移方法

Abstract: Deep learning models deployed in real-world applications (e.g., medicine)
face challenges because source models do not generalize well to domain-shifted
target data. Many successful domain adaptation (DA) approaches require full
access to source data. Yet, such requirements are unrealistic in scenarios
where source data cannot be shared either because of privacy concerns or
because it is too large and incurs prohibitive storage or computational costs.
Moreover, resource constraints may limit the availability of labeled targets.
We illustrate this challenge in a neuroscience setting where source data are
unavailable, labeled target data are meager, and predictions involve
continuous-valued outputs. We build upon Contradistinguisher (CUDA), an
efficient framework that learns a shared model across the labeled source and
unlabeled target samples, without intermediate representation alignment. Yet,
CUDA was designed for unsupervised DA, with full access to source data, and for
classification tasks. We develop CRAFT -- a Contradistinguisher-based
Regularization Approach for Flexible Training -- for source-free (SF),
semi-supervised transfer of pretrained models in regression tasks. We showcase
the efficacy of CRAFT in two neuroscience settings: gaze prediction with
electroencephalography (EEG) data and ``brain age'' prediction with structural
MRI data. For both datasets, CRAFT yielded up to 9% improvement in
root-mean-squared error (RMSE) over fine-tuned models when labeled training
examples were scarce. Moreover, CRAFT leveraged unlabeled target data and
outperformed four competing state-of-the-art source-free domain adaptation
models by more than 3%. Lastly, we demonstrate the efficacy of CRAFT on two
other real-world regression benchmarks. We propose CRAFT as an efficient
approach for source-free, semi-supervised deep transfer for regression that is
ubiquitous in biology and medicine.

Motivation: 解决现有素材生成方法速度慢、依赖UV映射、且无法保持与参考图片高保真的问题

Method: 使用Transformer框架结合三平面表示和基于深度的逆投损失，直接从单张图片和网格预测3D素材场

Result: 每个形状只需0.2秒生成高保真素材，在定性、定量和用户偏好评估中都超过现有最佳方法

Conclusion: 该方法具有可扩展性、高质量和可控性的优势，适用于实用的3D内容创建

Abstract: High-quality textures are critical for realistic 3D content creation, yet
existing generative methods are slow, rely on UV maps, and often fail to remain
faithful to a reference image. To address these challenges, we propose a
transformer-based framework that predicts a 3D texture field directly from a
single image and a mesh, eliminating the need for UV mapping and differentiable
rendering, and enabling faster texture generation. Our method integrates a
triplane representation with depth-based backprojection losses, enabling
efficient training and faster inference. Once trained, it generates
high-fidelity textures in a single forward pass, requiring only 0.2s per shape.
Extensive qualitative, quantitative, and user preference evaluations
demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on
single-image texture reconstruction in terms of both fidelity to the input
image and perceptual quality, highlighting its practicality for scalable,
high-quality, and controllable 3D content creation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SGS-3D是一种无需训练的3D实例分割优化方法，通过"先分割后生长"框架，结合语义和几何信息，显著提升分割精度和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于2D到3D提升的3D实例分割方法由于提升过程中的累积误差、模糊语义指导和深度约束不足，难以产生精确的实例级分割结果。

Method: 提出"split-then-grow"框架：首先使用几何基元净化和分割模糊的提升掩码，然后在场景中将它们生长成完整的实例。引入掩码过滤策略利用3D几何基元的共现性识别和移除模糊掩码，并通过空间连续性和高级特征构建细粒度对象实例。

Result: 在ScanNet200、ScanNet++和KITTI-360数据集上的实验表明，SGS-3D显著提高了分割精度和鲁棒性，能够处理预训练模型产生的不准确掩码，在不同室内外环境中保持强泛化能力。

Conclusion: SGS-3D作为一种无需训练的优化方法，通过有效融合语义和几何信息，实现了高保真度的3D实例分割，为解决2D到3D提升方法中的模糊语义和深度约束不足问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate 3D instance segmentation is crucial for high-quality scene
understanding in the 3D vision domain. However, 3D instance segmentation based
on 2D-to-3D lifting approaches struggle to produce precise instance-level
segmentation, due to accumulated errors introduced during the lifting process
from ambiguous semantic guidance and insufficient depth constraints. To tackle
these challenges, we propose splitting and growing reliable semantic mask for
high-fidelity 3D instance segmentation (SGS-3D), a novel "split-then-grow"
framework that first purifies and splits ambiguous lifted masks using geometric
primitives, and then grows them into complete instances within the scene.
Unlike existing approaches that directly rely on raw lifted masks and sacrifice
segmentation accuracy, SGS-3D serves as a training-free refinement method that
jointly fuses semantic and geometric information, enabling effective
cooperation between the two levels of representation. Specifically, for
semantic guidance, we introduce a mask filtering strategy that leverages the
co-occurrence of 3D geometry primitives to identify and remove ambiguous masks,
thereby ensuring more reliable semantic consistency with the 3D object
instances. For the geometric refinement, we construct fine-grained object
instances by exploiting both spatial continuity and high-level features,
particularly in the case of semantic ambiguity between distinct objects.
Experimental results on ScanNet200, ScanNet++, and KITTI-360 demonstrate that
SGS-3D substantially improves segmentation accuracy and robustness against
inaccurate masks from pre-trained models, yielding high-fidelity object
instances while maintaining strong generalization across diverse indoor and
outdoor environments. Code is available in the supplementary materials.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对手语识别(SLR)的自监督学习框架，通过自由负样本对和新数据增强技术解决对比学习中忽视关键区域和负样本相似度过高的问题，在多个评估场景中显著提升了准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手语识别面临标注数据稀缺问题，对比学习方法虽然有效但存在两个主要问题：1) 对所有视频区域同等对待，忽略了关键信息区域的重要性；2) 不同手语之间的共享动作导致负样本对过于相似，增加了识别难度。

Method: 提出了包含两个关键组件的自监督学习框架：1) 使用自由负样本对的新自监督方法；2) 新的数据增强技术。这两个组件协同工作以学习更有区分性的特征表示。

Result: 与多种对比学习和自监督方法相比，该方法在线性评估、半监督学习以及跨手语迁移任务中都显示出显著的准确率提升。

Conclusion: 该框架通过解决对比学习在手语识别中的特定问题，成功学习了更有意义的表示，为手语识别任务提供了有效的自监督解决方案。

Abstract: Sign language recognition (SLR) is a machine learning task aiming to identify
signs in videos. Due to the scarcity of annotated data, unsupervised methods
like contrastive learning have become promising in this field. They learn
meaningful representations by pulling positive pairs (two augmented versions of
the same instance) closer and pushing negative pairs (different from the
positive pairs) apart. In SLR, in a sign video, only certain parts provide
information that is truly useful for its recognition. Applying contrastive
methods to SLR raises two issues: (i) contrastive learning methods treat all
parts of a video in the same way, without taking into account the relevance of
certain parts over others; (ii) shared movements between different signs make
negative pairs highly similar, complicating sign discrimination. These issues
lead to learning non-discriminative features for sign recognition and poor
results in downstream tasks. In response, this paper proposes a self-supervised
learning framework designed to learn meaningful representations for SLR. This
framework consists of two key components designed to work together: (i) a new
self-supervised approach with free-negative pairs; (ii) a new data augmentation
technique. This approach shows a considerable gain in accuracy compared to
several contrastive and self-supervised methods, across linear evaluation,
semi-supervised learning, and transferability between sign languages.

Motivation: 探索LLMs在生成符号图形程序方面的能力，特别是SVG生成，以此作为理解LLMs视觉世界认知的窗口，并解决开源模型与前沿专有模型之间的性能差距。

Method: 引入SGP-GenBench基准测试评估模型性能；提出基于强化学习的方法，使用格式有效性验证和跨模态奖励（SigLIP和DINO编码器）来优化SVG生成。

Result: 前沿专有模型显著优于开源模型，性能与通用编码能力相关；应用强化学习方法后，Qwen-2.5-7B模型在SVG生成质量和语义对齐方面达到前沿系统水平。

Conclusion: 符号图形编程为跨模态基础提供了精确且可解释的研究视角，强化学习方法能有效提升模型的对象分解能力和场景连贯性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at program synthesis, yet their ability to
produce symbolic graphics programs (SGPs) that render into precise visual
content remains underexplored. We study symbolic graphics programming, where
the goal is to generate an SGP from a natural-language description. This task
also serves as a lens into how LLMs understand the visual world by prompting
them to generate images rendered from SGPs. Among various SGPs, our paper
sticks to scalable vector graphics (SVGs). We begin by examining the extent to
which LLMs can generate SGPs. To this end, we introduce SGP-GenBench, a
comprehensive benchmark covering object fidelity, scene fidelity, and
compositionality (attribute binding, spatial relations, numeracy). On
SGP-GenBench, we discover that frontier proprietary models substantially
outperform open-source models, and performance correlates well with general
coding capabilities. Motivated by this gap, we aim to improve LLMs' ability to
generate SGPs. We propose a reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable rewards
approach, where a format-validity gate ensures renderable SVG, and a
cross-modal reward aligns text and the rendered image via strong vision
encoders (e.g., SigLIP for text-image and DINO for image-image). Applied to
Qwen-2.5-7B, our method substantially improves SVG generation quality and
semantics, achieving performance on par with frontier systems. We further
analyze training dynamics, showing that RL induces (i) finer decomposition of
objects into controllable primitives and (ii) contextual details that improve
scene coherence. Our results demonstrate that symbolic graphics programming
offers a precise and interpretable lens on cross-modal grounding.

Abstract: The ability to compose learned concepts and apply them in novel settings is
key to human intelligence, but remains a persistent limitation in
state-of-the-art machine learning models. To address this issue, we introduce
COGITAO, a modular and extensible data generation framework and benchmark
designed to systematically study compositionality and generalization in visual
domains. Drawing inspiration from ARC-AGI's problem-setting, COGITAO constructs
rule-based tasks which apply a set of transformations to objects in grid-like
environments. It supports composition, at adjustable depth, over a set of 28
interoperable transformations, along with extensive control over grid
parametrization and object properties. This flexibility enables the creation of
millions of unique task rules -- surpassing concurrent datasets by several
orders of magnitude -- across a wide range of difficulties, while allowing
virtually unlimited sample generation per rule. We provide baseline experiments
using state-of-the-art vision models, highlighting their consistent failures to
generalize to novel combinations of familiar elements, despite strong in-domain
performance. COGITAO is fully open-sourced, including all code and datasets, to
support continued research in this field.

designed for long-horizon multi-task environments, exploring diffusion-based
skill learning techniques in cross-domain settings. The framework enables rapid
adaptation of skill-based reinforcement learning policies to diverse target
domains, especially under stringent constraints on no model updates and only
limited target domain data. Specifically, the framework employs a cross-domain
skill diffusion scheme, where domain-agnostic prototype skills and a
domain-grounded skill adapter are learned jointly and effectively from an
offline dataset through cross-domain consistent diffusion processes. The
prototype skills act as primitives for common behavior representations of
long-horizon policies, serving as a lingua franca to bridge different domains.
Furthermore, to enhance the in-context adaptation performance, we develop a
dynamic domain prompting scheme that guides the diffusion-based skill adapter
toward better alignment with the target domain. Through experiments with
robotic manipulation in Metaworld and autonomous driving in CARLA, we show that
our $\oursol$ framework achieves superior policy adaptation performance under
limited target domain data conditions for various cross-domain configurations
including differences in environment dynamics, agent embodiment, and task
horizon.

Method: 采用Action Chunking with Transformers (ACT)方法，仅使用100个专家示范（相当于6300次环境交互），学习将视觉和状态观测映射到推力和转矩命令的控制策略

Abstract: We present an imitation learning approach for spacecraft guidance,
navigation, and control(GNC) that achieves high performance from limited data.
Using only 100 expert demonstrations, equivalent to 6,300 environment
interactions, our method, which implements Action Chunking with Transformers
(ACT), learns a control policy that maps visual and state observations to
thrust and torque commands. ACT generates smoother, more consistent
trajectories than a meta-reinforcement learning (meta-RL) baseline trained with
40 million interactions. We evaluate ACT on a rendezvous task: in-orbit docking
with the International Space Station (ISS). We show that our approach achieves
greater accuracy, smoother control, and greater sample efficiency.

TL;DR: SPOT是一种混合学习和规划方法，通过搜索点云对象变换序列来规划机器人操作，无需离散化动作或对象关系，在连续高维动作空间中实现长时程规划


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统任务规划方法需要对连续状态和动作空间进行离散化处理，而SPOT旨在利用学习模型作为领域特定先验来指导高维连续动作空间的搜索

Method: SPOT从学习到的建议器中采样候选动作，这些建议器在部分观测的点云上操作，搜索从初始场景点云到满足目标的点云的变换序列

Conclusion: 搜索式规划对于长时程机器人操作任务至关重要，SPOT通过结合学习和规划的方法有效解决了连续动作空间中的规划问题

Abstract: Long-horizon planning for robot manipulation is a challenging problem that
requires reasoning about the effects of a sequence of actions on a physical 3D
scene. While traditional task planning methods are shown to be effective for
long-horizon manipulation, they require discretizing the continuous state and
action space into symbolic descriptions of objects, object relationships, and
actions. Instead, we propose a hybrid learning-and-planning approach that
leverages learned models as domain-specific priors to guide search in
high-dimensional continuous action spaces. We introduce SPOT: Search over Point
cloud Object Transformations, which plans by searching for a sequence of
transformations from an initial scene point cloud to a goal-satisfying point
cloud. SPOT samples candidate actions from learned suggesters that operate on
partially observed point clouds, eliminating the need to discretize actions or
object relationships. We evaluate SPOT on multi-object rearrangement tasks,
reporting task planning success and task execution success in both simulation
and real-world environments. Our experiments show that SPOT generates
successful plans and outperforms a policy-learning approach. We also perform
ablations that highlight the importance of search-based planning.

Motivation: 多模态表面材料分类对于机器人触觉感知和交互至关重要，需要开发能够有效整合视觉和触觉信息的架构。

Method: 基于Surformer v1框架改进，将特征提取整合到模型中并转向后期融合。视觉分支使用CNN分类器(Efficient V-Net)，触觉分支使用仅编码器transformer模型，通过可学习的加权和进行决策级融合。

Result: 在Touch and Go数据集上表现良好，保持竞争性推理速度，适合实时机器人应用。

Conclusion: 决策级融合和基于transformer的触觉建模对于增强多模态机器人感知中的表面理解是有效的。

Abstract: Multimodal surface material classification plays a critical role in advancing
tactile perception for robotic manipulation and interaction. In this paper, we
present Surformer v2, an enhanced multi-modal classification architecture
designed to integrate visual and tactile sensory streams through a
late(decision level) fusion mechanism. Building on our earlier Surformer v1
framework [1], which employed handcrafted feature extraction followed by
mid-level fusion architecture with multi-head cross-attention layers, Surformer
v2 integrates the feature extraction process within the model itself and shifts
to late fusion. The vision branch leverages a CNN-based classifier(Efficient
V-Net), while the tactile branch employs an encoder-only transformer model,
allowing each modality to extract modality-specific features optimized for
classification. Rather than merging feature maps, the model performs
decision-level fusion by combining the output logits using a learnable weighted
sum, enabling adaptive emphasis on each modality depending on data context and
training dynamics. We evaluate Surformer v2 on the Touch and Go dataset [2], a
multi-modal benchmark comprising surface images and corresponding tactile
sensor readings. Our results demonstrate that Surformer v2 performs well,
maintaining competitive inference speed, suitable for real-time robotic
applications. These findings underscore the effectiveness of decision-level
fusion and transformer-based tactile modeling for enhancing surface
understanding in multi-modal robotic perception.

Abstract: Automated vehicle control using reinforcement learning (RL) has attracted
significant attention due to its potential to learn driving policies through
environment interaction. However, RL agents often face training challenges in
sample efficiency and effective exploration, making it difficult to discover an
optimal driving strategy. To address these issues, we propose guiding the RL
driving agent with a demonstration policy that need not be a highly optimized
or expert-level controller. Specifically, we integrate a rule-based lane change
controller with the Soft Actor Critic (SAC) algorithm to enhance exploration
and learning efficiency. Our approach demonstrates improved driving performance
and can be extended to other driving scenarios that can similarly benefit from
demonstration-based guidance.

Abstract: As humanoid robots enter real-world environments, ensuring robust locomotion
across diverse environments is crucial. This paper presents a computationally
efficient hierarchical control framework for humanoid robot locomotion based on
reduced-order models -- enabling versatile step planning and incorporating arm
and torso dynamics to better stabilize the walking. At the high level, we use
the step-to-step dynamics of the ALIP model to simultaneously optimize over
step periods, step lengths, and ankle torques via nonlinear MPC. The ALIP
trajectories are used as references to a linear MPC framework that extends the
standard SRB-MPC to also include simplified arm and torso dynamics. We validate
the performance of our approach through simulation and hardware experiments on
the Unitree G1 humanoid robot. In the proposed framework the high-level step
planner runs at 40 Hz and the mid-level MPC at 500 Hz using the onboard
mini-PC. Adaptive step timing increased the push recovery success rate by 36%,
and the upper body control improved the yaw disturbance rejection. We also
demonstrate robust locomotion across diverse indoor and outdoor terrains,
including grass, stone pavement, and uneven gym mats.

Abstract: In the field of robot learning, coordinating robot actions through language
instructions is becoming increasingly feasible. However, adapting actions to
human instructions remains challenging, as such instructions are often
qualitative and require exploring behaviors that satisfy varying conditions.
This paper proposes a motion generation model that adapts robot actions in
response to modifier directives human instructions imposing behavioral
conditions during task execution. The proposed method learns a mapping from
modifier directives to actions by segmenting demonstrations into short
sequences, assigning weakly supervised labels corresponding to specific
modifier types. We evaluated our method in wiping and pick and place tasks.
Results show that it can adjust motions online in response to modifier
directives, unlike conventional batch-based methods that cannot adapt during
execution.

Abstract: Continuous advancements in robotics and AI are driving the integration of
robots from industry into everyday environments. However, dynamic and
unpredictable human activities in daily lives would directly or indirectly
conflict with robot actions. Besides, due to the social attributes of such
human-induced conflicts, solutions are not always unique and depend highly on

fine-tuned model inference for low-confidence cases. Based on collected user
preferred options and settings, GPT-4o will be used to summarize user
preferences from relevant cases. In preliminary studies, our detection module
shows better accuracy and latency compared with GPT models. To facilitate

Conclusion: 扩散模型与专家路由相结合为知识驱动的端到端自动驾驶提供了一个可扩展且可解释的范式，专家激活分析揭示了结构化的专业化和跨场景专家重用。

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving remains constrained by the need to generate
multi-modal actions, maintain temporal stability, and generalize across diverse
scenarios. Existing methods often collapse multi-modality, struggle with
long-horizon consistency, or lack modular adaptability. This paper presents
KDP, a knowledge-driven diffusion policy that integrates generative diffusion
modeling with a sparse mixture-of-experts routing mechanism. The diffusion
component generates temporally coherent and multi-modal action sequences, while
the expert routing mechanism activates specialized and reusable experts
according to context, enabling modular knowledge composition. Extensive
experiments across representative driving scenarios demonstrate that KDP
achieves consistently higher success rates, reduced collision risk, and
smoother control compared to prevailing paradigms. Ablation studies highlight
the effectiveness of sparse expert activation and the Transformer backbone, and
activation analyses reveal structured specialization and cross-scenario reuse
of experts. These results establish diffusion with expert routing as a scalable
and interpretable paradigm for knowledge-driven end-to-end autonomous driving.

Abstract: Topological localization is a fundamental problem in mobile robotics, since
robots must be able to determine their position in order to accomplish tasks.
Visual localization and place recognition are challenging due to perceptual
ambiguity, sensor noise, and illumination variations. This work addresses
topological localization in an office environment using only images acquired
with a perspective color camera mounted on a robot platform, without relying on
temporal continuity of image sequences. We evaluate state-of-the-art visual
descriptors, including Color Histograms, SIFT, ASIFT, RGB-SIFT, and
Bag-of-Visual-Words approaches inspired by text retrieval. Our contributions
include a systematic, quantitative comparison of these features, distance
measures, and classifiers. Performance was analyzed using standard evaluation
metrics and visualizations, extending previous experiments. Results demonstrate
the advantages of proper configurations of appearance descriptors, similarity
measures, and classifiers. The quality of these configurations was further
validated in the Robot Vision task of the ImageCLEF evaluation campaign, where
the system identified the most likely location of novel image sequences. Future
work will explore hierarchical models, ranking methods, and feature
combinations to build more robust localization systems, reducing training and
runtime while avoiding the curse of dimensionality. Ultimately, this aims
toward integrated, real-time localization across varied illumination and longer
routes.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a 3D path planning method that integrates the A*
algorithm with the octree structure. Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) and legged
robots have been extensively studied, enabling locomotion across a variety of
terrains. Advances in mobility have enabled obstacles to be regarded not only
as hindrances to be avoided, but also as navigational aids when beneficial. A
modified 3D A* algorithm generates an optimal path by leveraging obstacles
during the planning process. By incorporating a height-based penalty into the
cost function, the algorithm enables the use of traversable obstacles to aid
locomotion while avoiding those that are impassable, resulting in more
efficient and realistic path generation. The octree-based 3D grid map achieves
compression by merging high-resolution nodes into larger blocks, especially in
obstacle-free or sparsely populated areas. This reduces the number of nodes
explored by the A* algorithm, thereby improving computational efficiency and
memory usage, and supporting real-time path planning in practical environments.
Benchmark results demonstrate that the use of octree structure ensures an
optimal path while significantly reducing memory usage and computation time.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) agents can learn to solve complex tasks from
visual inputs, but generalizing these learned skills to new environments
remains a major challenge in RL application, especially robotics. While data
augmentation can improve generalization, it often compromises sample efficiency
and training stability. This paper introduces DeGuV, an RL framework that
enhances both generalization and sample efficiency. In specific, we leverage a
learnable masker network that produces a mask from the depth input, preserving
only critical visual information while discarding irrelevant pixels. Through
this, we ensure that our RL agents focus on essential features, improving
robustness under data augmentation. In addition, we incorporate contrastive
learning and stabilize Q-value estimation under augmentation to further enhance
sample efficiency and training stability. We evaluate our proposed method on
the RL-ViGen benchmark using the Franka Emika robot and demonstrate its
effectiveness in zero-shot sim-to-real transfer. Our results show that DeGuV
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both generalization and sample
efficiency while also improving interpretability by highlighting the most

Abstract: Deep learning, with its exceptional learning capabilities and flexibility,

strategies for robot kinematic control in a stable manner. This achievement
provides a critical foundation for future advancements in deep learning based

Abstract: Developing efficient Vision-Language-Action (VLA) policies is crucial for
practical robotics deployment, yet current approaches face prohibitive
computational costs and resource requirements. Existing diffusion-based VLA
policies require multi-billion-parameter models and massive datasets to achieve
strong performance. We tackle this efficiency challenge with two contributions:
intermediate-modality fusion, which reallocates capacity to the diffusion head
by pruning up to $50\%$ of LLM layers, and action-specific Global-AdaLN
conditioning, which cuts parameters by $20\%$ through modular adaptation. We
integrate these advances into a novel 950 M-parameter VLA called FLOWER.
Pretrained in just 200 H100 GPU hours, FLOWER delivers competitive performance
with bigger VLAs across $190$ tasks spanning ten simulation and real-world

Abstract: Deictic gestures, like pointing, are a fundamental form of non-verbal
communication, enabling humans to direct attention to specific objects or
locations. This capability is essential in Human-Robot Interaction (HRI), where
robots should be able to predict human intent and anticipate appropriate
responses. In this work, we propose the Multi-Modality Inter-TransFormer
(MM-ITF), a modular architecture to predict objects in a controlled tabletop
scenario with the NICOL robot, where humans indicate targets through natural
pointing gestures. Leveraging inter-modality attention, MM-ITF maps 2D pointing
gestures to object locations, assigns a likelihood score to each, and
identifies the most likely target. Our results demonstrate that the method can
accurately predict the intended object using monocular RGB data, thus enabling
intuitive and accessible human-robot collaboration. To evaluate the
performance, we introduce a patch confusion matrix, providing insights into the
model's predictions across candidate object locations. Code available at:

Abstract: Shared autonomy is a promising paradigm in robotic systems, particularly
within the maritime domain, where complex, high-risk, and uncertain
environments necessitate effective human-robot collaboration. This paper
investigates the interaction of three complementary approaches to advance
shared autonomy in heterogeneous marine robotic fleets: (i) the integration of
Large Language Models (LLMs) to facilitate intuitive high-level task
specification and support hull inspection missions, (ii) the implementation of
human-in-the-loop interaction frameworks in multi-agent settings to enable
adaptive and intent-aware coordination, and (iii) the development of a modular
Mission Manager based on Behavior Trees to provide interpretable and flexible
mission control. Preliminary results from simulation and real-world lake-like
environments demonstrate the potential of this multi-layered architecture to
reduce operator cognitive load, enhance transparency, and improve adaptive
behaviour alignment with human intent. Ongoing work focuses on fully
integrating these components, refining coordination mechanisms, and validating
the system in operational port scenarios. This study contributes to
establishing a modular and scalable foundation for trustworthy,
human-collaborative autonomy in safety-critical maritime robotics applications.

TL;DR: 提出了一个鲁棒模型预测控制框架，专门处理深度学习感知模块中的非高斯噪声，使用约束zonotopes进行状态估计，通过线性规划和Minkowski-Lyapunov方法确保稳定性和计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法假设感知误差为零均值高斯噪声，但实际深度学习感知模块存在有偏、重尾的非高斯噪声，需要更准确的噪声量化来保证反馈控制的安全性。

Method: 使用约束zonotopes进行基于集合的状态估计，将鲁棒MPC重构为线性规划问题，采用Minkowski-Lyapunov成本函数和松弛变量，通过椭球近似推导最大稳定终端集和反馈增益。

Result: 在全方位移动机器人上的仿真和硬件实验表明，该方法在重尾噪声条件下提供稳定准确的控制性能，在状态估计误差边界和整体控制性能方面显著优于传统高斯噪声设计。

Conclusion: 该感知感知MPC框架有效处理了深度学习感知模块的非高斯噪声问题，为安全反馈控制提供了可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper presents a robust model predictive control (MPC) framework that
explicitly addresses the non-Gaussian noise inherent in deep learning-based
perception modules used for state estimation. Recognizing that accurate
uncertainty quantification of the perception module is essential for safe
feedback control, our approach departs from the conventional assumption of
zero-mean noise quantification of the perception error. Instead, it employs
set-based state estimation with constrained zonotopes to capture biased,
heavy-tailed uncertainties while maintaining bounded estimation errors. To
improve computational efficiency, the robust MPC is reformulated as a linear
program (LP), using a Minkowski-Lyapunov-based cost function with an added
slack variable to prevent degenerate solutions. Closed-loop stability is
ensured through Minkowski-Lyapunov inequalities and contractive zonotopic
invariant sets. The largest stabilizing terminal set and its corresponding
feedback gain are then derived via an ellipsoidal approximation of the
zonotopes. The proposed framework is validated through both simulations and
hardware experiments on an omnidirectional mobile robot along with a camera and
a convolutional neural network-based perception module implemented within a
ROS2 framework. The results demonstrate that the perception-aware MPC provides
stable and accurate control performance under heavy-tailed noise conditions,
significantly outperforming traditional Gaussian-noise-based designs in terms
of both state estimation error bounding and overall control performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度强化学习在机器人任务中探索效率低和引导误差导致次优策略的问题，通过结合示范数据提高学习效率

Method: 基于IBRL算法改进动作选择模块，提供校准的Q值来减少引导误差；使用SAC代替TD3作为RL策略防止次优收敛；在装桶和开抽屉等机器人任务中验证

Result: 实验验证了方法在减少引导误差和防止过拟合方面的有效性；框架在不同状态-动作维度和示范质量的任务中表现鲁棒；成功实现从仿真到真实轮式装载机的部署

Conclusion: DRLR框架通过改进的动作选择模块和SAC策略，有效提高了机器人任务中的探索效率和学习性能，实现了从仿真到真实环境的成功迁移

Abstract: This paper proposes an exploration-efficient Deep Reinforcement Learning with
Reference policy (DRLR) framework for learning robotics tasks that incorporates
demonstrations. The DRLR framework is developed based on an algorithm called
Imitation Bootstrapped Reinforcement Learning (IBRL). We propose to improve
IBRL by modifying the action selection module. The proposed action selection
module provides a calibrated Q-value, which mitigates the bootstrapping error
that otherwise leads to inefficient exploration. Furthermore, to prevent the RL
policy from converging to a sub-optimal policy, SAC is used as the RL policy
instead of TD3. The effectiveness of our method in mitigating bootstrapping
error and preventing overfitting is empirically validated by learning two
robotics tasks: bucket loading and open drawer, which require extensive
interactions with the environment. Simulation results also demonstrate the
robustness of the DRLR framework across tasks with both low and high
state-action dimensions, and varying demonstration qualities. To evaluate the
developed framework on a real-world industrial robotics task, the bucket
loading task is deployed on a real wheel loader. The sim2real results validate
the successful deployment of the DRLR framework.

TL;DR: Q-SafeML是一种针对量子机器学习的安全监控方法，通过量子中心距离度量来检测概念漂移，提升系统透明度和安全性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量子机器学习在安全关键系统中应用日益增多，但现有经典ML安全监控方法不适用于QML，需要专门的安全机制

Method: 基于SafeML方法，采用量子中心距离度量来评估模型准确性，进行模型依赖的后分类评估，检测操作数据与训练数据之间的距离

Result: 在QCNN和VQC模型上的实验表明，该方法能够实现知情的人类监督

Conclusion: Q-SafeML为量子机器学习提供了有效的安全监控解决方案，适应了量子系统的独特表示约束

Abstract: The rise of machine learning in safety-critical systems has paralleled
advancements in quantum computing, leading to the emerging field of Quantum
Machine Learning (QML). While safety monitoring has progressed in classical ML,
existing methods are not directly applicable to QML due to fundamental
differences in quantum computation. Given the novelty of QML, dedicated safety
mechanisms remain underdeveloped. This paper introduces Q-SafeML, a safety
monitoring approach for QML. The method builds on SafeML, a recent method that
utilizes statistical distance measures to assess model accuracy and provide
confidence in the reasoning of an algorithm. An adapted version of Q-SafeML
incorporates quantum-centric distance measures, aligning with the probabilistic
nature of QML outputs. This shift to a model-dependent, post-classification
evaluation represents a key departure from classical SafeML, which is
dataset-driven and classifier-agnostic. The distinction is motivated by the
unique representational constraints of quantum systems, requiring distance
metrics defined over quantum state spaces. Q-SafeML detects distances between
operational and training data addressing the concept drifts in the context of
QML. Experiments on QCNN and VQC Models show that this enables informed human
oversight, enhancing system transparency and safety.

Abstract: Deep Learning is evolving fast and integrates into various domains. Finance
is a challenging field for deep learning, especially in the case of
interpretable artificial intelligence (AI). Although classical approaches
perform very well with natural language processing, computer vision, and
forecasting, they are not perfect for the financial world, in which specialists
use different metrics to evaluate model performance.
  We first introduce financially grounded loss functions derived from key
quantitative finance metrics, including the Sharpe ratio, Profit-and-Loss
(PnL), and Maximum Draw down. Additionally, we propose turnover regularization,
a method that inherently constrains the turnover of generated positions within
predefined limits.
  Our findings demonstrate that the proposed loss functions, in conjunction
with turnover regularization, outperform the traditional mean squared error
loss for return prediction tasks when evaluated using algorithmic trading
metrics. The study shows that financially grounded metrics enhance predictive
performance in trading strategies and portfolio optimization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法假设固定的最大迭代深度，这既昂贵又武断。需要一种能够利用自我改进任务循环结构的方法，让模型在推理时进行多步自我改进。

Method: ExIt通过选择性采样训练过程中遇到的最具信息量的中间部分历史，将这些起点作为新的自我迭代任务实例来训练自我改进策略，并可结合显式探索机制维持任务多样性。

Result: 在数学竞赛、多轮工具使用和机器学习工程等多个领域，ExIt策略能够产生在测试任务实例上表现出强推理时自我改进能力的策略，并且能够在超出训练时平均迭代深度的步数预算内迭代到更高性能。

Conclusion: ExIt方法有效解决了固定迭代深度限制的问题，通过自课程学习实现了超越训练深度的推理时自我改进能力，在多个复杂任务领域展现出优越性能。

Abstract: Progress in many task domains emerges from repeated revisions to previous
solution attempts. Training agents that can reliably self-improve over such
sequences at inference-time is a natural target for reinforcement learning
(RL), yet the naive approach assumes a fixed maximum iteration depth, which can
be both costly and arbitrary. We present Exploratory Iteration (ExIt), a family
of autocurriculum RL methods that directly exploits the recurrent structure of
self-improvement tasks to train LLMs to perform multi-step self-improvement at
inference-time while only training on the most informative single-step
iterations. ExIt grows a task space by selectively sampling the most
informative intermediate, partial histories encountered during an episode for
continued iteration, treating these starting points as new self-iteration task
instances to train a self-improvement policy. ExIt can further pair with
explicit exploration mechanisms to sustain greater task diversity. Across
several domains, encompassing competition math, multi-turn tool-use, and
machine learning engineering, we demonstrate that ExIt strategies, starting
from either a single or many task instances, can produce policies exhibiting
strong inference-time self-improvement on held-out task instances, and the
ability to iterate towards higher performance over a step budget extending
beyond the average iteration depth encountered during training.

Conclusion: 该适应性采样策略具有广泛适用性，可扩展到其他逆问题，为传统固定数据集训练模式提供了可扩展且实用的替代方案。

Abstract: We propose an instance-wise adaptive sampling framework for constructing
compact and informative training datasets for supervised learning of inverse
problem solutions. Typical learning-based approaches aim to learn a
general-purpose inverse map from datasets drawn from a prior distribution, with
the training process independent of the specific test instance. When the prior
has a high intrinsic dimension or when high accuracy of the learned solution is
required, a large number of training samples may be needed, resulting in
substantial data collection costs. In contrast, our method dynamically
allocates sampling effort based on the specific test instance, enabling
significant gains in sample efficiency. By iteratively refining the training
dataset conditioned on the latest prediction, the proposed strategy tailors the
dataset to the geometry of the inverse map around each test instance. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in the inverse scattering problem
under two types of structured priors. Our results show that the advantage of
the adaptive method becomes more pronounced in settings with more complex
priors or higher accuracy requirements. While our experiments focus on a
particular inverse problem, the adaptive sampling strategy is broadly
applicable and readily extends to other inverse problems, offering a scalable
and practical alternative to conventional fixed-dataset training regimes.

Conclusion: 量子信息特征和适应性任务权重的多任务分子学习框架在ADMET预测中具有高效和高效果的特点，为药物发现提供了有力的技术支持

Abstract: Prediction for ADMET (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, and
Toxicity) plays a crucial role in drug discovery and development, accelerating
the screening and optimization of new drugs. Existing methods primarily rely on
single-task learning (STL), which often fails to fully exploit the
complementarities between tasks. Besides, it requires more computational
resources while training and inference of each task independently. To address
these issues, we propose a new unified Quantum-enhanced and task-Weighted
Multi-Task Learning (QW-MTL) framework, specifically designed for ADMET
classification tasks. Built upon the Chemprop-RDKit backbone, QW-MTL adopts
quantum chemical descriptors to enrich molecular representations with
additional information about the electronic structure and interactions.
Meanwhile, it introduces a novel exponential task weighting scheme that
combines dataset-scale priors with learnable parameters to achieve dynamic loss
balancing across tasks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to
systematically conduct joint multi-task training across all 13 Therapeutics
Data Commons (TDC) classification benchmarks, using leaderboard-style data
splits to ensure a standardized and realistic evaluation setting. Extensive
experimental results show that QW-MTL significantly outperforms single-task
baselines on 12 out of 13 tasks, achieving high predictive performance with
minimal model complexity and fast inference, demonstrating the effectiveness
and efficiency of multi-task molecular learning enhanced by quantum-informed
features and adaptive task weighting.

Motivation: 表征相似性度量是神经科学和AI领域的基础工具，但缺乏对不同度量方法区分模型家族能力的系统比较，需要建立定量评估框架来指导度量方法的选择。

Conclusion: 研究首次通过分离度视角系统比较了相似性度量方法，阐明了它们的相对敏感性，为大规模模型和大脑比较中的度量方法选择提供了指导。

Abstract: Representational similarity metrics are fundamental tools in neuroscience and
AI, yet we lack systematic comparisons of their discriminative power across
model families. We introduce a quantitative framework to evaluate
representational similarity measures based on their ability to separate model
families-across architectures (CNNs, Vision Transformers, Swin Transformers,
ConvNeXt) and training regimes (supervised vs. self-supervised). Using three
complementary separability measures-dprime from signal detection theory,
silhouette coefficients and ROC-AUC, we systematically assess the
discriminative capacity of commonly used metrics including RSA, linear
predictivity, Procrustes, and soft matching. We show that separability
systematically increases as metrics impose more stringent alignment
constraints. Among mapping-based approaches, soft-matching achieves the highest
separability, followed by Procrustes alignment and linear predictivity.
Non-fitting methods such as RSA also yield strong separability across families.
These results provide the first systematic comparison of similarity metrics
through a separability lens, clarifying their relative sensitivity and guiding
metric choice for large-scale model and brain comparisons.

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification for neural operators remains an open problem in
the infinite-dimensional setting due to the lack of finite-sample coverage
guarantees over functional outputs. While conformal prediction offers
finite-sample guarantees in finite-dimensional spaces, it does not directly
extend to function-valued outputs. Existing approaches (Gaussian processes,
Bayesian neural networks, and quantile-based operators) require strong
distributional assumptions or yield conservative coverage. This work extends
split conformal prediction to function spaces following a two step method. We
first establish finite-sample coverage guarantees in a finite-dimensional space
using a discretization map in the output function space. Then these guarantees
are lifted to the function-space by considering the asymptotic convergence as
the discretization is refined. To characterize the effect of resolution, we
decompose the conformal radius into discretization, calibration, and
misspecification components. This decomposition motivates a regression-based
correction to transfer calibration across resolutions. Additionally, we propose
two diagnostic metrics (conformal ensemble score and internal agreement) to
quantify forecast degradation in autoregressive settings. Empirical results
show that our method maintains calibrated coverage with less variation under
resolution shifts and achieves better coverage in super-resolution tasks.

Conclusion: 转导共形预测存在置信度-效率权衡的根本限制，预测集大小不可避免会随不确定性指数增长，这为实际应用提供了重要的理论指导。

Abstract: Transductive conformal prediction addresses the simultaneous prediction for
multiple data points. Given a desired confidence level, the objective is to
construct a prediction set that includes the true outcomes with the prescribed
confidence. We demonstrate a fundamental trade-off between confidence and
efficiency in transductive methods, where efficiency is measured by the size of
the prediction sets. Specifically, we derive a strict finite-sample bound
showing that any non-trivial confidence level leads to exponential growth in
prediction set size for data with inherent uncertainty. The exponent scales
linearly with the number of samples and is proportional to the conditional
entropy of the data. Additionally, the bound includes a second-order term,
dispersion, defined as the variance of the log conditional probability
distribution. We show that this bound is achievable in an idealized setting.
Finally, we examine a special case of transductive prediction where all test
data points share the same label. We show that this scenario reduces to the
hypothesis testing problem with empirically observed statistics and provide an
asymptotically optimal confidence predictor, along with an analysis of the
error exponent.

Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability aims to understand how internal components of
modern machine learning models, such as weights, activations, and layers, give
rise to the model's overall behavior. One particularly opaque mechanism is
attention: despite its central role in transformer models, its mathematical
underpinnings and relationship to concepts like feature polysemanticity,
superposition, and model performance remain poorly understood. This paper
establishes a novel connection between attention mechanisms and multinomial
regression. Specifically, we show that in a fixed multinomial regression
setting, optimizing over latent features yields optimal solutions that align
with the dynamics induced by attention blocks. In other words, the evolution of
representations through a transformer can be interpreted as a trajectory that
recovers the optimal features for classification.

Abstract: Understanding how animals learn is a central challenge in neuroscience, with
growing relevance to the development of animal- or human-aligned artificial
intelligence. However, most existing approaches assume specific parametric
forms for the learning rule (e.g., Q-learning, policy gradient) or are limited
to simplified settings like bandit tasks, which do not involve learning a new
input-output mapping from scratch. In contrast, animals must often learn new
behaviors de novo, which poses a rich challenge for learning-rule inference. We
target this problem by inferring learning rules directly from animal
decision-making data during de novo task learning, a setting that requires
models flexible enough to capture suboptimality, history dependence, and rich
external stimulus integration without strong structural priors. We first
propose a nonparametric framework that parameterizes the per-trial update of
policy weights with a deep neural network (DNN), and validate it by recovering
ground-truth rules in simulation. We then extend to a recurrent variant (RNN)
that captures non-Markovian dynamics by allowing updates to depend on trial
history. Applied to a large behavioral dataset of mice learning a sensory
decision-making task over multiple weeks, our models improved predictions on
held-out data. The inferred rules revealed asymmetric updates after correct
versus error trials and history dependence, consistent with non-Markovian
learning. Overall, these results introduce a flexible framework for inferring
biological learning rules from behavioral data in de novo learning tasks,
providing insights to inform experimental training protocols and the
development of behavioral digital twins.

*Difei Xu,Meng Ding,Zihang Xiang,Jinhui Xu,Di Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究差分隐私模型下的随机凸优化(DP-SCO)，在Tsybakov噪声条件下，即使损失函数的Lipschitz常数极大或无界，只要梯度有界矩，仍能获得与Lipschitz常数无关的隐私保护算法性能上界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统DP-SCO研究假设损失函数是Lipschitz连续的，但在实际应用中Lipschitz常数可能极大甚至无界。本文旨在研究在更弱的Tsybakov噪声条件下，即使损失函数非Lipschitz，也能实现有效的差分隐私优化。

Method: 针对θ≥2的Lipschitz情况，提出(ε,δ)-DP算法；扩展到θ≥θ̅>1的一般情况；在隐私预算ε足够小时，即使损失函数非Lipschitz也能获得上界；同时给出ρ-zero集中差分隐私的下界。

Result: 获得了与Lipschitz常数无关的效用上界：Õ((r̃₂ₖ(1/√n + (√d/nε))^(k-1)/k)^(θ/(θ-1)))，并在小隐私预算下扩展到非Lipschitz情况。下界表明该速率是最优的。

Conclusion: 在Tsybakov噪声条件下，即使损失函数非Lipschitz，只要梯度有界矩，仍能设计出有效的差分隐私优化算法，且获得的效用界限是最优的。

Abstract: We study Stochastic Convex Optimization in the Differential Privacy model
(DP-SCO). Unlike previous studies, here we assume the population risk function
satisfies the Tsybakov Noise Condition (TNC) with some parameter $\theta>1$,
where the Lipschitz constant of the loss could be extremely large or even
unbounded, but the $\ell_2$-norm gradient of the loss has bounded $k$-th moment
with $k\geq 2$. For the Lipschitz case with $\theta\geq 2$, we first propose an
$(\varepsilon, \delta)$-DP algorithm whose utility bound is
$\Tilde{O}\left(\left(\tilde{r}_{2k}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}+(\frac{\sqrt{d}}{n\varepsilon}))^\frac{k-1}{k}\right)^\frac{\theta}{\theta-1}\right)$
in high probability, where $n$ is the sample size, $d$ is the model dimension,
and $\tilde{r}_{2k}$ is a term that only depends on the $2k$-th moment of the
gradient. It is notable that such an upper bound is independent of the
Lipschitz constant. We then extend to the case where
  $\theta\geq \bar{\theta}> 1$ for some known constant $\bar{\theta}$.
Moreover, when the privacy budget $\varepsilon$ is small enough, we show an
upper bound of
$\tilde{O}\left(\left(\tilde{r}_{k}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}+(\frac{\sqrt{d}}{n\varepsilon}))^\frac{k-1}{k}\right)^\frac{\theta}{\theta-1}\right)$
even if the loss function is not Lipschitz. For the lower bound, we show that
for any $\theta\geq 2$, the private minimax rate for $\rho$-zero Concentrated
Differential Privacy is lower bounded by
$\Omega\left(\left(\tilde{r}_{k}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}+(\frac{\sqrt{d}}{n\sqrt{\rho}}))^\frac{k-1}{k}\right)^\frac{\theta}{\theta-1}\right)$.

*Yazdan Babazadeh Maghsoodlo,Madhur Anand,Chris T. Bauch*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 深度学习CNN LSTM模型能够准确识别复杂系统中的闪烁现象（flickering），这是系统韧性降低的早期预警信号，在合成数据和真实数据中都表现出良好的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 闪烁现象是气候系统、生态系统、金融市场等复杂系统中韧性降低的标志性特征，可能预示着难以预测的关键状态转变，但深度学习在此领域的潜力尚未被探索。

Method: 使用卷积长短期记忆（CNN LSTM）模型，在由简单多项式函数加噪声生成的合成时间序列上进行训练，然后应用于各种随机系统和实证数据集。

Result: 模型能够准确识别闪烁模式，在合成动力学训练后能泛化到不同的随机系统，并在实证数据（如睡鼠体温记录和非洲湿润期古气候代理数据）中可靠检测到闪烁现象。

Conclusion: 深度学习可以从嘈杂的非线性时间序列中提取早期预警信号，为识别各种动力系统中的不稳定性提供了一个灵活框架。

Abstract: Deep learning offers powerful tools for anticipating tipping points in
complex systems, yet its potential for detecting flickering (noise-driven
switching between coexisting stable states) remains unexplored. Flickering is a
hallmark of reduced resilience in climate systems, ecosystems, financial
markets, and other systems. It can precede critical regime shifts that are
highly impactful but difficult to predict. Here we show that convolutional long
short-term memory (CNN LSTM) models, trained on synthetic time series generated
from simple polynomial functions with additive noise, can accurately identify
flickering patterns. Despite being trained on simplified dynamics, our models
generalize to diverse stochastic systems and reliably detect flickering in
empirical datasets, including dormouse body temperature records and
palaeoclimate proxies from the African Humid Period. These findings demonstrate
that deep learning can extract early warning signals from noisy, nonlinear time
series, providing a flexible framework for identifying instability across a
wide range of dynamical systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: KRATF是一个基于学习的数字地图融合方法，通过知识图谱构建、地图匹配和地图合并三个模块，解决了传统方法只能处理线性对象和基于启发式规则的局限性，在性能上优于现有方法。

Method: KRATF包含三个部分：1)知识图谱构建-将地理空间数据库表示为知识图谱；2)地图匹配-使用知识图谱对齐方法和地理空间特征编码器匹配实体；3)地图合并-通过混合整数线性规划公式一致地合并匹配实体。

Result: 实验评估表明，KRATF在地图融合任务中相比最先进方法和基线方法表现出色，其各个模块（如地图匹配和地图合并）也分别优于传统的匹配和合并方法。

Conclusion: KRATF成功解决了传统地图融合方法的局限性，通过基于学习的方法实现了更全面和准确的地图融合，为数字地图的更新和维护提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Digital maps play a crucial role in various applications such as navigation,
fleet management, and ride-sharing, necessitating their accuracy and currency,
which require timely updates. While the majority of geospatial databases (GDBs)
provide high-quality information, their data is (i) limited to specific regions
and/or (ii) missing some entities, even in their covered areas. Map conflation
is the process of augmentation of a GDB using another GDB to conflate missing
spatial features. Existing map conflation methods suffer from two main
limitations: (1) They are designed for the conflation of linear objects (e.g.,
road networks) and cannot simply be extended to non-linear objects, thus
missing information about most entities in the map. (2) They are heuristic
algorithmic approaches that are based on pre-defined rules, unable to learn
entities matching in a data-driven manner. To address these limitations, we
design KRAFT, a learning based approach consisting of three parts: (1)
Knowledge Graph Construction - where each GDB is represented by a knowledge
graph, (2) Map Matching - where we use a knowledge graph alignment method as
well as a geospatial feature encoder to match entities in obtained knowledge
graphs, and (3) Map Merging - where we merge matched entities in the previous
modules in a consistent manner, using a mixed integer linear programming
formulation that fully merges the GDBs without adding any inconsistencies. Our
experimental evaluation shows that not only does KRAFT achieve outstanding
performance compared to state-of-the-art and baseline methods in map conflation
tasks, but each of its modules (e.g., Map Matching and Map Merging) also
separately outperforms traditional matching and merging methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用低成本生物信号（如表面肌电信号）实现连续手势识别，但弱模态数据表示质量有限，需要与高质量结构化数据对齐来提升性能

Method: 提出对比姿态-EMG预训练框架（CPEP），学习EMG编码器生成高质量且包含姿态信息的表示，通过线性探测和零样本设置评估性能

Result: 在分布内手势分类上比基准模型提升21%，在未见（分布外）手势分类上提升72%

Conclusion: 通过学习弱模态数据与高质量数据的对齐表示，可以显著提升手势分类性能，特别是在零样本场景下

Abstract: Hand gesture classification using high-quality structured data such as
videos, images, and hand skeletons is a well-explored problem in computer
vision. Leveraging low-power, cost-effective biosignals, e.g. surface
electromyography (sEMG), allows for continuous gesture prediction on wearables.
In this paper, we demonstrate that learning representations from weak-modality
data that are aligned with those from structured, high-quality data can improve
representation quality and enables zero-shot classification. Specifically, we
propose a Contrastive Pose-EMG Pre-training (CPEP) framework to align EMG and
pose representations, where we learn an EMG encoder that produces high-quality
and pose-informative representations. We assess the gesture classification
performance of our model through linear probing and zero-shot setups. Our model
outperforms emg2pose benchmark models by up to 21% on in-distribution gesture
classification and 72% on unseen (out-of-distribution) gesture classification.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了自然频谱融合(NSF)方法，通过p指数扩展和循环调度来动态控制优化器的频谱偏好，改善低频和高频信息的平衡与融合，从而提高模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究广泛讨论了机器学习中的频谱行为，但优化器自身的频谱偏好仍不明确。作者认为一阶优化器存在固有的频率偏好，这会显著影响优化路径。

Method: 提出NSF方法：将优化器视为频谱控制器，通过p指数扩展二阶矩项（支持正负指数）和循环调度，动态平衡低频和高频信息，周期性重新加权频率带。

Result: 理论分析和实验表明：自适应方法强调低频信息，SGD接近中性，负指数放大高频信息。循环调度拓宽频谱覆盖，改善跨频带融合，在多个基准测试中持续降低测试误差。

Conclusion: NSF揭示了优化器作为主动频谱控制器的作用，为了一阶优化提供了一个统一、可控且高效的框架，能够以更低的训练成本达到相同或更好的精度。

Abstract: Spectral behaviors have been widely discussed in machine learning, yet the
optimizer's own spectral bias remains unclear. We argue that first-order
optimizers exhibit an intrinsic frequency preference that significantly
reshapes the optimization path. To address this, we propose Natural Spectral
Fusion (NSF): reframing training as controllable spectral coverage and
information fusion rather than merely scaling step sizes. NSF has two core
principles: treating the optimizer as a spectral controller that dynamically
balances low- and high-frequency information; and periodically reweighting
frequency bands at negligible cost, without modifying the model, data, or
training pipeline. We realize NSF via a p-exponent extension of the
second-moment term, enabling both positive and negative exponents, and
implement it through cyclic scheduling. Theory and experiments show that
adaptive methods emphasize low frequencies, SGD is near-neutral, and negative
exponents amplify high-frequency information. Cyclic scheduling broadens
spectral coverage, improves cross-band fusion, and induces early
decision-boundary alignment, where accuracy improves even while loss remains
high. Across multiple benchmarks, with identical learning-rate strategies and
fixed hyperparameters, p-exponent cyclic scheduling consistently reduces test
error and demonstrates distinct convergence behavior; on some tasks, it matches
baseline accuracy with only one-quarter of the training cost. Overall, NSF
reveals the optimizer's role as an active spectral controller and provides a
unified, controllable, and efficient framework for first-order optimization.

TL;DR: CoVeR是一种基于共形预测框架的无模型解码策略，能够在保持紧凑搜索空间的同时确保对期望轨迹的高覆盖概率，提供理论保证的覆盖率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 主流解码策略如beam search缺乏可证明的覆盖保证，难以平衡搜索效率与多样化轨迹需求，特别是在需要长尾序列的现实应用中。

Method: 提出CoVeR方法，在共形预测框架内构建无模型解码策略，通过理论分析建立PAC风格的泛化边界。

Result: 理论证明CoVeR能够渐近地实现至少1-α的覆盖率，其中α∈(0,1)是任意目标水平。

Conclusion: CoVeR为解决解码策略的覆盖保证问题提供了有效的解决方案，具有理论保证和实际应用价值。

Abstract: Autoregressive pre-trained models combined with decoding methods have
achieved impressive performance on complex reasoning tasks. While mainstream
decoding strategies such as beam search can generate plausible candidate sets,
they often lack provable coverage guarantees, and struggle to effectively
balance search efficiency with the need for versatile trajectories,
particularly those involving long-tail sequences that are essential in certain
real-world applications. To address these limitations, we propose
\textsc{CoVeR}, a novel model-free decoding strategy wihtin the conformal
prediction framework that simultaneously maintains a compact search space and
ensures high coverage probability over desirable trajectories. Theoretically,
we establish a PAC-style generalization bound, guaranteeing that \textsc{CoVeR}
asymptotically achieves a coverage rate of at least $1 - \alpha$ for any target
level $\alpha \in (0,1)$.

TL;DR: Beyond I-Con框架通过探索不同的统计散度和相似性核函数，系统性地发现新的损失函数，在无监督聚类、监督对比学习和降维任务中均取得了优于现有方法的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: I-Con框架发现现有表示学习方法隐含地最小化数据分布与学习分布之间的KL散度，但KL散度的不对称性和无界性可能导致优化问题与真实目标不一致。

Method: 提出Beyond I-Con框架，探索替代的统计散度（如总变差距离、有界f-散度）和相似性核函数（如距离核替代角度核），系统性地发现新的损失函数。

Result: 在DINO-ViT嵌入的无监督聚类中达到SOTA；在监督对比学习中超越标准方法；在降维任务中获得更好的定性结果和下游任务性能。

Conclusion: 表示学习优化中散度和相似性核函数的选择至关重要，Beyond I-Con框架为系统探索这些选择提供了有效途径。

Abstract: The Information Contrastive (I-Con) framework revealed that over 23
representation learning methods implicitly minimize KL divergence between data
and learned distributions that encode similarities between data points.
However, a KL-based loss may be misaligned with the true objective, and
properties of KL divergence such as asymmetry and unboundedness may create
optimization challenges. We present Beyond I-Con, a framework that enables
systematic discovery of novel loss functions by exploring alternative
statistical divergences and similarity kernels. Key findings: (1) on
unsupervised clustering of DINO-ViT embeddings, we achieve state-of-the-art
results by modifying the PMI algorithm to use total variation (TV) distance;
(2) on supervised contrastive learning, we outperform the standard approach by
using TV and a distance-based similarity kernel instead of KL and an angular
kernel; (3) on dimensionality reduction, we achieve superior qualitative
results and better performance on downstream tasks than SNE by replacing KL
with a bounded f-divergence. Our results highlight the importance of
considering divergence and similarity kernel choices in representation learning
optimization.

TL;DR: VARMAformer结合了现代Transformer架构和经典VARMA统计模型，通过VARMA特征提取器和增强注意力机制，在时间序列预测中实现了更好的全局和局部依赖关系建模，显著超越了现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的简化Transformer架构（如CATS）虽然提高了效率和准确性，但可能忽略了经典统计模型（如VARMA）能够有效捕捉的细粒度局部时间依赖性。

Method: 提出了VARMAformer架构，包含两个关键创新：1）VARMA启发的特征提取器（VFE），在patch级别显式建模自回归和移动平均模式；2）VARMA增强注意力机制（VE-atten），使用时序门控使查询更具上下文感知能力。

Result: 在广泛使用的基准数据集上进行大量实验，证明该模型始终优于现有的最先进方法。

Conclusion: 这项工作验证了将经典统计洞察融入现代深度学习框架对时间序列预测的显著益处，成功融合了全局长程依赖和局部统计结构的捕捉能力。

Abstract: Transformer-based models have significantly advanced time series forecasting.
Recent work, like the Cross-Attention-only Time Series transformer (CATS),
shows that removing self-attention can make the model more accurate and
efficient. However, these streamlined architectures may overlook the
fine-grained, local temporal dependencies effectively captured by classical
statistical models like Vector AutoRegressive Moving Average model (VARMA). To
address this gap, we propose VARMAformer, a novel architecture that synergizes
the efficiency of a cross-attention-only framework with the principles of
classical time series analysis. Our model introduces two key innovations: (1) a
dedicated VARMA-inspired Feature Extractor (VFE) that explicitly models
autoregressive (AR) and moving-average (MA) patterns at the patch level, and
(2) a VARMA-Enhanced Attention (VE-atten) mechanism that employs a temporal
gate to make queries more context-aware. By fusing these classical insights
into a modern backbone, VARMAformer captures both global, long-range
dependencies and local, statistical structures. Through extensive experiments
on widely-used benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that our model consistently
outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. Our work validates the
significant benefit of integrating classical statistical insights into modern
deep learning frameworks for time series forecasting.

Abstract: With increasing concerns about privacy attacks and potential sensitive
information leakage, researchers have actively explored methods to efficiently
remove sensitive training data and reduce privacy risks in graph neural network
(GNN) models. Node unlearning has emerged as a promising technique for
protecting the privacy of sensitive nodes by efficiently removing specific
training node information from GNN models. However, existing node unlearning
methods either impose restrictions on the GNN structure or do not effectively
utilize the graph topology for node unlearning. Some methods even compromise
the graph's topology, making it challenging to achieve a satisfactory
performance-complexity trade-off. To address these issues and achieve efficient
unlearning for training node removal in GNNs, we propose three novel node
unlearning methods: Class-based Label Replacement, Topology-guided Neighbor
Mean Posterior Probability, and Class-consistent Neighbor Node Filtering. Among
these methods, Topology-guided Neighbor Mean Posterior Probability and
Class-consistent Neighbor Node Filtering effectively leverage the topological
features of the graph, resulting in more effective node unlearning. To validate
the superiority of our proposed methods in node unlearning, we conducted
experiments on three benchmark datasets. The evaluation criteria included model
utility, unlearning utility, and unlearning efficiency. The experimental
results demonstrate the utility and efficiency of the proposed methods and
illustrate their superiority compared to state-of-the-art node unlearning
methods. Overall, the proposed methods efficiently remove sensitive training
nodes and protect the privacy information of sensitive nodes in GNNs. The
findings contribute to enhancing the privacy and security of GNN models and
provide valuable insights into the field of node unlearning.

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (RL) models, despite their efficiency in learning
an optimal policy in static environments, easily loses previously learned
knowledge (i.e., catastrophic forgetting). It leads RL models to poor
performance in continual reinforcement learning (CRL) scenarios. To address
this, we present an arbitration control mechanism over an ensemble of RL
agents. It is motivated by and closely aligned with how humans make decisions
in a CRL context using an arbitration control of multiple RL agents in parallel
as observed in the prefrontal cortex. We integrated two key ideas into our
model: (1) an ensemble of RLs (i.e., DQN variants) explicitly trained to have
diverse value functions and (2) an arbitration control that prioritizes agents
with higher reliability (i.e., less error) in recent trials. We propose a
framework for CRL, an Arbitration Control for an Ensemble of Diversified DQN
variants (ACED-DQN). We demonstrate significant performance improvements in
both static and continual environments, supported by empirical evidence showing
the effectiveness of arbitration control over diversified DQNs during training.
In this work, we introduced a framework that enables RL agents to continuously
learn, with inspiration from the human brain.

Abstract: Time series forecasting plays a critical role in decision-making processes
across diverse fields including meteorology, traffic, electricity, economics,
finance, and so on. Especially, predicting returns on financial instruments is
a challenging problem. Some researchers have proposed time series foundation
models applicable to various forecasting tasks. Simultaneously, based on the
recognition that real-world time series exhibit chaotic properties, methods
have been developed to artificially generate synthetic chaotic time series,
construct diverse datasets and train models. In this study, we propose a
methodology for modeling financial time series by generating artificial chaotic
time series and applying resampling techniques to simulate financial time
series data, which we then use as training samples. Increasing the resampling
interval to extend predictive horizons, we conducted large-scale pre-training
using 10 billion training samples for each case. We subsequently created test
datasets for multiple timeframes using actual Bitcoin trade data and performed
zero-shot prediction without re-training the pre-trained model. The results of
evaluating the profitability of a simple trading strategy based on these
predictions demonstrated significant performance improvements over
autocorrelation models. During the large-scale pre-training process, we
observed a scaling law-like phenomenon that we can achieve predictive
performance at a certain level with extended predictive horizons for chaotic
time series by increasing the number of training samples exponentially. If this
scaling law proves robust and holds true across various chaotic models, it
suggests the potential to predict near-future events by investing substantial
computational resources. Future research should focus on further large-scale
training and verifying the applicability of this scaling law to diverse chaotic
models.

Conventional machine learning methods struggle to grapple with complex patterns

TrailGate can identifies common attack types and excels at detecting and

Abstract: The limited ability to reason across occupational data from different sources
is a long-standing bottleneck for data-driven labour market analytics. Previous
research has relied on hand-crafted ontologies that allow such reasoning but
are computationally expensive and require careful maintenance by human experts.
The rise of language processing machine learning models offers a scalable
alternative by learning shared semantic spaces that bridge diverse occupational
vocabularies without extensive human curation. We present an embedding-based
alignment process that links any free-form German job title to two established
ontologies - the German Klassifikation der Berufe and the International
Standard Classification of Education. Using publicly available data from the
German Federal Employment Agency, we construct a dataset to fine-tune a
Sentence-BERT model to learn the structure imposed by the ontologies. The
enriched pairs (job title, embedding) define a similarity graph structure that
we can use for efficient approximate nearest-neighbour search, allowing us to
frame the classification process as a semantic search problem. This allows for
greater flexibility, e.g., adding more classes. We discuss design decisions,
open challenges, and outline ongoing work on extending the graph with other
ontologies and multilingual titles.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Blinks in electroencephalography (EEG) are often treated as unwanted
artifacts. However, recent studies have demonstrated that blink rate and its
variability are important physiological markers to monitor cognitive load,
attention, and potential neurological disorders. This paper addresses the
critical task of accurate blink detection by evaluating various deep learning
models for segmenting EEG signals into involuntary blinks and non-blinks. We
present a pipeline for blink detection using 1, 3, or 5 frontal EEG electrodes.
The problem is formulated as a sequence-to-sequence task and tested on various
deep learning architectures including standard recurrent neural networks,
convolutional neural networks (both standard and depth-wise), temporal
convolutional networks (TCN), transformer-based models, and hybrid
architectures. The models were trained on raw EEG signals with minimal
pre-processing. Training and testing was carried out on a public dataset of 31
subjects collected at UCSD. This dataset consisted of 15 healthy participants
and 16 patients with Parkinson's disease allowing us to verify the model's
robustness to tremor. Out of all models, CNN-RNN hybrid model consistently
outperformed other models and achieved the best blink detection accuracy of
93.8%, 95.4% and 95.8% with 1, 3, and 5 channels in the healthy cohort and
correspondingly 73.8%, 75.4% and 75.8% in patients with PD. The paper compares
neural networks for the task of segmenting EEG recordings to involuntary blinks
and no blinks allowing for computing blink rate and other statistics.

TL;DR: 提出使用双随机归一化方法分离混淆矩阵中的类别相似性和分布偏差因素，以更准确诊断分类器行为


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 混淆矩阵值同时受类别相似性（模型混淆程度）和分布偏差（训练测试集分布不均）影响，难以区分两者的独立贡献

Method: 引入基于迭代比例拟合的双随机归一化方法，该方法能恢复类别相似性的底层结构，相比标准行列归一化更具一般性

Result: 双随机归一化能够有效分离误差来源，支持更有针对性的模型改进，并在几何上对应模型内部类别表示空间

Conclusion: 该方法提供了对分类器行为的更深层次理解，揭示了归一化操作在类别表示空间中的几何意义

Abstract: The confusion matrix is a standard tool for evaluating classifiers by
providing insights into class-level errors. In heterogeneous settings, its
values are shaped by two main factors: class similarity -- how easily the model
confuses two classes -- and distribution bias, arising from skewed
distributions in the training and test sets. However, confusion matrix values
reflect a mix of both factors, making it difficult to disentangle their
individual contributions. To address this, we introduce bistochastic
normalization using Iterative Proportional Fitting, a generalization of row and
column normalization. Unlike standard normalizations, this method recovers the
underlying structure of class similarity. By disentangling error sources, it
enables more accurate diagnosis of model behavior and supports more targeted
improvements. We also show a correspondence between confusion matrix
normalizations and the model's internal class representations. Both standard
and bistochastic normalizations can be interpreted geometrically in this space,
offering a deeper understanding of what normalization reveals about a
classifier.

Motivation: 标准MLP-based PINNs在处理复杂初值问题时经常无法收敛，导致解违反因果性并存在低频频谱偏差，需要新的架构来解决这些问题。

Method: NeuSA学习PDE在谱基上的投影，获得动力学的有限维表示，然后通过适应的神经ODE进行集成，利用谱表示的高频分量克服频谱偏差，继承NODE的因果结构，并基于经典方法的初始化方案。

Result: 在线性和非线性波动方程的基准测试中，NeuSA相比其他架构表现出更强的性能，具有更快的收敛速度、改进的时间一致性和更高的预测精度。

Conclusion: NeuSA通过结合谱方法和神经ODE，有效解决了PINNs在复杂PDE求解中的关键问题，为物理信息神经网络提供了新的架构方向。

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a powerful neural
framework for solving partial differential equations (PDEs). However, standard
MLP-based PINNs often fail to converge when dealing with complex initial-value
problems, leading to solutions that violate causality and suffer from a
spectral bias towards low-frequency components. To address these issues, we
introduce NeuSA (Neuro-Spectral Architectures), a novel class of PINNs inspired
by classical spectral methods, designed to solve linear and nonlinear PDEs with
variable coefficients. NeuSA learns a projection of the underlying PDE onto a
spectral basis, leading to a finite-dimensional representation of the dynamics
which is then integrated with an adapted Neural ODE (NODE). This allows us to
overcome spectral bias, by leveraging the high-frequency components enabled by
the spectral representation; to enforce causality, by inheriting the causal
structure of NODEs, and to start training near the target solution, by means of
an initialization scheme based on classical methods. We validate NeuSA on
canonical benchmarks for linear and nonlinear wave equations, demonstrating
strong performance as compared to other architectures, with faster convergence,
improved temporal consistency and superior predictive accuracy. Code and
pretrained models will be released.

Abstract: This paper proposes a topology-aware graph reinforcement learning approach to
address the routing policy optimization problem in cloud server environments.
The method builds a unified framework for state representation and structural
evolution by integrating a Structure-Aware State Encoding (SASE) module and a
Policy-Adaptive Graph Update (PAGU) mechanism. It aims to tackle the challenges
of decision instability and insufficient structural awareness under dynamic
topologies. The SASE module models node states through multi-layer graph
convolution and structural positional embeddings, capturing high-order
dependencies in the communication topology and enhancing the expressiveness of
state representations. The PAGU module adjusts the graph structure based on
policy behavior shifts and reward feedback, enabling adaptive structural
updates in dynamic environments. Experiments are conducted on the real-world
GEANT topology dataset, where the model is systematically evaluated against
several representative baselines in terms of throughput, latency control, and
link balance. Additional experiments, including hyperparameter sensitivity,
graph sparsity perturbation, and node feature dimensionality variation, further
explore the impact of structure modeling and graph updates on model stability
and decision quality. Results show that the proposed method outperforms
existing graph reinforcement learning models across multiple performance
metrics, achieving efficient and robust routing in dynamic and complex cloud
networks.

Conclusion: 通过分析批量归一化层对TTA稳定性的负面影响，提出了基于梯度感知和表示正则化的SAR和SAR²方法，显著提升了测试时自适应的稳定性和鲁棒性，为实际部署提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) may fail to improve or even harm the model
performance when test data have: 1) mixed distribution shifts, 2) small batch
sizes, 3) online imbalanced label distribution shifts. This is often a key
obstacle preventing existing TTA methods from being deployed in the real world.
In this paper, we investigate the unstable reasons and find that the batch norm
layer is a crucial factor hindering TTA stability. Conversely, TTA can perform
more stably with batch-agnostic norm layers, i.e., group or layer norm.
However, we observe that TTA with group and layer norms does not always succeed
and still suffers many failure cases, i.e., the model collapses into trivial
solutions by assigning the same class label for all samples. By digging into
this, we find that, during the collapse process: 1) the model gradients often
undergo an initial explosion followed by rapid degradation, suggesting that
certain noisy test samples with large gradients may disrupt adaptation; and 2)
the model representations tend to exhibit high correlations and classification
bias. To address this, we first propose a sharpness-aware and reliable entropy
minimization method, called SAR, for stabilizing TTA from two aspects: 1)
remove partial noisy samples with large gradients, 2) encourage model weights
to go to a flat minimum so that the model is robust to the remaining noisy
samples. Based on SAR, we further introduce SAR^2 to prevent representation
collapse with two regularizers: 1) a redundancy regularizer to reduce
inter-dimensional correlations among centroid-invariant features; and 2) an
inequity regularizer to maximize the prediction entropy of a prototype
centroid, thereby penalizing biased representations toward any specific class.
Promising results demonstrate that our methods perform more stably over prior
methods and are computationally efficient under the above wild test scenarios.

Abstract: Directed evolution is an iterative laboratory process of designing proteins
with improved function by iteratively synthesizing new protein variants and
evaluating their desired property with expensive and time-consuming biochemical
screening. Machine learning methods can help select informative or promising
variants for screening to increase their quality and reduce the amount of
necessary screening. In this paper, we present a novel method for
machine-learning-assisted directed evolution of proteins which combines
Bayesian optimization with informative representation of protein variants
extracted from a pre-trained protein language model. We demonstrate that the
new representation based on the sequence embeddings significantly improves the
performance of Bayesian optimization yielding better results with the same
number of conducted screening in total. At the same time, our method
outperforms the state-of-the-art machine-learning-assisted directed evolution
methods with regression objective.

Motivation: 现有的初始化方法如Glorot、He、正交矩阵等，有的注重保持激活值和梯度传播的单位方差，有的考虑网络总深度。但在深度网络中，单位方差的理论假设表现不佳，需要从第一层到最后一层逐渐增加方差。

Method: 提出了一种新的灵活方式来增加网络的方差，该方法结合了每个层的深度信息，考虑了每个层的深度以及整个网络的深度结构。

Result: 实验结果显示，提出的方法在深度神经网络中的表现超过了现有的初始化方案，证明了考虑每个层深度信息的重要性。

Conclusion: 这项研究表明，在深度神经网络中，通过灵活增加激活值方差并考虑每个层的深度信息，可以实现更优称的初始化效果，为深度网络的训练提供了更有效的起始点。

Abstract: In past few years, various initialization schemes have been proposed. These
schemes are glorot initialization, He initialization, initialization using
orthogonal matrix, random walk method for initialization. Some of these methods
stress on keeping unit variance of activation and gradient propagation through
the network layer. Few of these methods are independent of the depth
information while some methods has considered the total network depth for
better initialization. In this paper, comprehensive study has been done where
depth information of each layer as well as total network is incorporated for
better initialization scheme. It has also been studied that for deeper networks
theoretical assumption of unit variance throughout the network does not perform
well. It requires the need to increase the variance of the network from first
layer activation to last layer activation. We proposed a novel way to increase
the variance of the network in flexible manner, which incorporates the
information of each layer depth. Experiments shows that proposed method
performs better than the existing initialization scheme.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of time-to-event outcomes is a central challenge in
oncology, with significant implications for treatment planning and patient
management. In this work, we present MultiSurv, a multimodal deep survival
model utilising DeepHit with a projection layer and inter-modality
cross-attention, which integrates heterogeneous patient data, including
clinical, MRI, RNA-seq and whole-slide pathology features. The model is
designed to capture complementary prognostic signals across modalities and
estimate individualised time-to-biochemical recurrence in prostate cancer and
time-to-cancer recurrence in bladder cancer. Our approach was evaluated in the
context of the CHIMERA Grand Challenge, across two of the three provided tasks.
For Task 1 (prostate cancer bio-chemical recurrence prediction), the proposed
framework achieved a concordance index (C-index) of 0.843 on 5-folds
cross-validation and 0.818 on CHIMERA development set, demonstrating robust
discriminatory ability. For Task 3 (bladder cancer recurrence prediction), the
model obtained a C-index of 0.662 on 5-folds cross-validation and 0.457 on
development set, highlighting its adaptability and potential for clinical
translation. These results suggest that leveraging multimodal integration with
deep survival learning provides a promising pathway toward personalised risk
stratification in prostate and bladder cancer. Beyond the challenge setting,
our framework is broadly applicable to survival prediction tasks involving
heterogeneous biomedical data.

Conclusion: 递归编码方法在TSP、CVRP和OP等组合优化问题中实现了更高效的解构建，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: The primary paradigm in Neural Combinatorial Optimization (NCO) are
construction methods, where a neural network is trained to sequentially add one
solution component at a time until a complete solution is constructed. We
observe that the typical changes to the state between two steps are small,
since usually only the node that gets added to the solution is removed from the
state. An efficient model should be able to reuse computation done in prior
steps. To that end, we propose to train a recurrent encoder that computes the
state embeddings not only based on the state but also the embeddings of the
step before. We show that the recurrent encoder can achieve equivalent or
better performance than a non-recurrent encoder even if it consists of
$3\times$ fewer layers, thus significantly improving on latency. We demonstrate
our findings on three different problems: the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP),
the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP), and the Orienteering Problem
(OP) and integrate the models into a large neighborhood search algorithm, to
showcase the practical relevance of our findings.

Motivation: 解决传统物理信息神经网络(PINNs)在处理不同参数化PDE时需要重新训练的问题，开发一个能够零样本泛化到新PDE任务的神经算子框架。

Result: 在七个PINN文献基准问题上实现了强大的零样本准确性，优于U-Nets、Poseidon和PINO。迭代细化过程在六个基准上平均L2损失降低100倍以上。HyPINO初始化的PINN在微调时收敛更快且误差更低。

Conclusion: HyPINO展示了作为扩展神经算子解决复杂非线性高维PDE问题的基础潜力，具有显著提高的准确性和降低的计算成本。

Abstract: We present HyPINO, a multi-physics neural operator designed for zero-shot
generalization across a broad class of parametric PDEs without requiring
task-specific fine-tuning. Our approach combines a Swin Transformer-based
hypernetwork with mixed supervision: (i) labeled data from analytical solutions
generated via the Method of Manufactured Solutions (MMS), and (ii) unlabeled
samples optimized using physics-informed objectives. The model maps PDE
parametrizations to target Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and can
handle linear elliptic, hyperbolic, and parabolic equations in two dimensions
with varying source terms, geometries, and mixed Dirichlet/Neumann boundary
conditions, including interior boundaries. HyPINO achieves strong zero-shot
accuracy on seven benchmark problems from PINN literature, outperforming
U-Nets, Poseidon, and Physics-Informed Neural Operators (PINO). Further, we
introduce an iterative refinement procedure that compares the physics of the
generated PINN to the requested PDE and uses the discrepancy to generate a
"delta" PINN. Summing their contributions and repeating this process forms an
ensemble whose combined solution progressively reduces the error on six
benchmarks and achieves over 100x gain in average $L_2$ loss in the best case,
while retaining forward-only inference. Additionally, we evaluate the
fine-tuning behavior of PINNs initialized by HyPINO and show that they converge
faster and to lower final error than both randomly initialized and
Reptile-meta-learned PINNs on five benchmarks, performing on par on the
remaining two. Our results highlight the potential of this scalable approach as
a foundation for extending neural operators toward solving increasingly
complex, nonlinear, and high-dimensional PDE problems with significantly
improved accuracy and reduced computational cost.

Result: 细粒度标签训练并不总是能提高分类准确率，其有效性关键取决于数据的几何结构及其与标签层次的关系

Conclusion: 细粒度标签训练的效果具有条件性，需要根据具体的数据特征和模型条件来评估是否采用这种策略

Abstract: In classification problems, models must predict a class label based on the
input data features. However, class labels are organized hierarchically in many
datasets. While a classification task is often defined at a specific level of
this hierarchy, training can utilize a finer granularity of labels. Empirical
evidence suggests that such fine-grained training can enhance performance. In
this work, we investigate the generality of this observation and explore its
underlying causes using both real and synthetic datasets. We show that training
on fine-grained labels does not universally improve classification accuracy.
Instead, the effectiveness of this strategy depends critically on the geometric
structure of the data and its relations with the label hierarchy. Additionally,
factors such as dataset size and model capacity significantly influence whether
fine-grained labels provide a performance benefit.

Conclusion: 自适应对手的存在对学习理论提出了更严峻的挑战，需要更强的学习条件来保证可学习性。

Abstract: We consider the question of learnability of distribution classes in the
presence of adaptive adversaries -- that is, adversaries capable of
intercepting the samples requested by a learner and applying manipulations with
full knowledge of the samples before passing it on to the learner. This stands
in contrast to oblivious adversaries, who can only modify the underlying
distribution the samples come from but not their i.i.d.\ nature. We formulate a
general notion of learnability with respect to adaptive adversaries, taking
into account the budget of the adversary. We show that learnability with
respect to additive adaptive adversaries is a strictly stronger condition than
learnability with respect to additive oblivious adversaries.

Abstract: Federated learning has the potential to unlock siloed data and distributed
resources by enabling collaborative model training without sharing private
data. As more complex foundational models gain widespread use, the need to
expand training resources and integrate privately owned data grows as well. In
this article, we explore the intersection of federated learning and
foundational models, aiming to identify, categorize, and characterize technical
methods that integrate the two paradigms. As a unified survey is currently
unavailable, we present a literature survey structured around a novel taxonomy
that follows the development life-cycle stages, along with a technical
comparison of available methods. Additionally, we provide practical insights
and guidelines for implementing and evolving these methods, with a specific
focus on the healthcare domain as a case study, where the potential impact of
federated learning and foundational models is considered significant. Our
survey covers multiple intersecting topics, including but not limited to
federated learning, self-supervised learning, fine-tuning, distillation, and
transfer learning. Initially, we retrieved and reviewed a set of over 4,200
articles. This collection was narrowed to more than 250 thoroughly reviewed

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种简单有效、实用可扩展的解决方案，能够在不改变现有标准推理流程的前提下实现高效的长上下文LLM部署。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) rely on key-value (KV) caches for efficient
autoregressive decoding; however, cache size grows linearly with context length
and model depth, becoming a major bottleneck in long-context inference. Prior
KV cache compression methods either enforce rigid heuristics, disrupt tensor
layouts with per-attention-head variability, or require specialized compute
kernels.
  We propose a simple, yet effective, KV cache compression framework based on
attention-guided, layer-adaptive composite tokens. Our method aggregates
attention scores to estimate token importance, selects head-specific tokens
independently, and aligns them into composite tokens that respect the uniform
cache structure required by existing inference engines. A global allocation
mechanism further adapts retention budgets across layers, assigning more
capacity to layers with informative tokens. This approach achieves significant
memory reduction while preserving accuracy, consistently outperforming prior
structured and semi-structured methods. Crucially, our approach remains fully
compatible with standard inference pipelines, offering a practical and scalable
solution for efficient long-context LLM deployment.

Abstract: Deep learning models, especially convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have
shown considerable promise for biomedical signals such as EEG-based seizure
detection. However, these models come with challenges, primarily due to their
size and compute requirements in environments where real-time detection or
limited resources are available. In this study, we present a lightweight
one-dimensional CNN model with structured pruning to improve efficiency and
reliability. The model was trained with mild early stopping to address possible
overfitting, achieving an accuracy of 92.78% and a macro-F1 score of 0.8686.
Structured pruning of the baseline CNN involved removing 50% of the
convolutional kernels based on their importance to model predictions.
Surprisingly, after pruning the weights and memory by 50%, the new network was
still able to maintain predictive capabilities, while modestly increasing
precision to 92.87% and improving the macro-F1 score to 0.8707. Overall, we
present a convincing case that structured pruning removes redundancy, improves
generalization, and, in combination with mild early stopping, achieves a
promising way forward to improve seizure detection efficiency and reliability,
which is clear motivation for resource-limited settings.

TL;DR: 本文挑战了强化学习中后继度量低秩结构的假设，发现移位后继度量才具有低秩特性，提出了基于Type II Poincaré不等式的有限样本性能保证，并通过实验验证了移位操作在目标条件强化学习中的有效性。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代强化学习算法普遍假设后继度量具有低秩结构，但本文发现这种假设不成立，需要研究移位后的后继度量才能揭示真正的低秩特性。

Method: 提出移位后继度量的概念，使用低秩矩阵近似方法，推导Type II Poincaré不等式来量化谱可恢复性参数，建立移位量与系统局部混合性质的联系。

Result: 证明了移位后继度量的低秩特性，提供了有限样本下的估计误差界限，发现所需移位量通常很小且取决于高阶奇异值衰减。实验验证了移位操作能提升目标条件强化学习性能。

Conclusion: 移位操作是揭示马尔可夫链动态系统低秩结构的关键，Type II Poincaré不等式为分析谱可恢复性提供了新工具，移位后继度量的低秩近似在实际强化学习任务中具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: Low-rank structure is a common implicit assumption in many modern
reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. For instance, reward-free and
goal-conditioned RL methods often presume that the successor measure admits a
low-rank representation. In this work, we challenge this assumption by first
remarking that the successor measure itself is not low-rank. Instead, we
demonstrate that a low-rank structure naturally emerges in the shifted
successor measure, which captures the system dynamics after bypassing a few
initial transitions. We provide finite-sample performance guarantees for the
entry-wise estimation of a low-rank approximation of the shifted successor
measure from sampled entries. Our analysis reveals that both the approximation
and estimation errors are primarily governed by the so-called spectral
recoverability of the corresponding matrix. To bound this parameter, we derive
a new class of functional inequalities for Markov chains that we call Type II
Poincar\'e inequalities and from which we can quantify the amount of shift
needed for effective low-rank approximation and estimation. This analysis shows
in particular that the required shift depends on decay of the high-order
singular values of the shifted successor measure and is hence typically small
in practice. Additionally, we establish a connection between the necessary
shift and the local mixing properties of the underlying dynamical system, which
provides a natural way of selecting the shift. Finally, we validate our
theoretical findings with experiments, and demonstrate that shifting the
successor measure indeed leads to improved performance in goal-conditioned RL.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become popular across a diverse set of
tasks in exploring structural relationships between entities. However, due to
the highly connected structure of the datasets, distributed training of GNNs on
large-scale graphs poses significant challenges. Traditional sampling-based
approaches mitigate the computational loads, yet the communication overhead
remains a challenge. This paper presents RapidGNN, a distributed GNN training
framework with deterministic sampling-based scheduling to enable efficient
cache construction and prefetching of remote features. Evaluation on benchmark
graph datasets demonstrates RapidGNN's effectiveness across different scales
and topologies. RapidGNN improves end-to-end training throughput by 2.46x to
3.00x on average over baseline methods across the benchmark datasets, while
cutting remote feature fetches by over 9.70x to 15.39x. RapidGNN further
demonstrates near-linear scalability with an increasing number of computing
units efficiently. Furthermore, it achieves increased energy efficiency over
the baseline methods for both CPU and GPU by 44% and 32%, respectively.

subspace projection to guarantee local updates of each client within
low-dimensional subspaces, thereby reducing communication, computation, and
memory costs. Additionally, it incorporates low-dimensional dual variables to
mitigate client drift. We provide convergence analysis that reveals the impact
of key factors such as step size and subspace projection matrices on
convergence. Experimental results demonstrate its efficiency.

Abstract: We present data driven deep learning models for forecasting and monitoring
amine emissions and key performance parameters in amine-based post-combustion
carbon capture systems. Using operational data from the CESAR1 solvent campaign
at Technology Center Mongstad, four DL architectures such as Basic Long
Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Stacked LSTM, Bi-directional LSTM, and Convolutional
LSTM were developed to capture time-dependent process behavior. For emission
prediction, models were designed for 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol (AMP) and
Piperazine emissions measured via FTIR and IMR-MS methods. System performance
models target four critical parameters: CO$_2$ product flow, absorber outlet
temperature, depleted flue gas outlet temperature, and RFCC stripper bottom
temperature. These models achieved high predictive accuracy exceeding 99% and
effectively tracked both steady trends and abrupt fluctuations. Additionally,
we conducted causal impact analysis to evaluate how operational variables
influence emissions and system performance. Eight input variables were
systematically perturbed within $\pm$20% of nominal values to simulate
deviations and assess their impact. This analysis revealed that adjusting
specific operational parameters, such as lean solvent temperature and water
wash conditions, can significantly reduce amine emissions and enhance system
performance. This study highlights ML not only as a predictive tool but also as
a decision support system for optimizing carbon capture operations under steady
state and dynamic conditions. By enabling real time monitoring, scenario
testing, and operational optimization, the developed ML framework offers a
practical pathway for mitigating environmental impacts. This work represents a
step toward intelligent, data-driven control strategies that enhance the
efficiency, stability, and sustainability of carbon capture and storage
technologies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电力系统自动发电控制(AGC)对电网稳定性至关重要，但容易受到隐蔽的网络攻击，如虚假数据注入攻击(FDIAs)，这些攻击会破坏系统稳定性且难以被传统检测方法发现

Method: 使用KAN模型离线学习AGC测量值在不同运行场景下的复杂非线性关系，训练后可以提取符号公式来描述模型行为，增强可解释性

Result: 提出的KAN模型实现了高达95.97%的FDIA检测率，符号公式检测率达到95.9%，且具有较低的误报率

Conclusion: KAN模型为增强AGC网络安全提供了一种可靠且可解释的方法，能够有效检测虚假数据注入攻击

Abstract: Automatic Generation Control (AGC) is essential for power grid stability but
remains vulnerable to stealthy cyberattacks, such as False Data Injection
Attacks (FDIAs), which can disturb the system's stability while evading
traditional detection methods. Unlike previous works that relied on blackbox
approaches, this work proposes Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) as an
interpretable and accurate method for FDIA detection in AGC systems,
considering the system nonlinearities. KAN models include a method for
extracting symbolic equations, and are thus able to provide more
interpretability than the majority of machine learning models. The proposed KAN
is trained offline to learn the complex nonlinear relationships between the AGC
measurements under different operating scenarios. After training, symbolic
formulas that describe the trained model's behavior can be extracted and
leveraged, greatly enhancing interpretability. Our findings confirm that the
proposed KAN model achieves FDIA detection rates of up to 95.97% and 95.9% for
the initial model and the symbolic formula, respectively, with a low false
alarm rate, offering a reliable approach to enhancing AGC cybersecurity.

Abstract: The growing computational demands of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) have
raised concerns about the environmental and economic costs of training
large-scale models. While algorithmic efficiency in terms of learning
performance has been extensively studied, the energy requirements, greenhouse
gas emissions, and monetary costs of DRL algorithms remain largely unexplored.
In this work, we present a systematic benchmarking study of the energy
consumption of seven state-of-the-art DRL algorithms, namely DQN, TRPO, A2C,
ARS, PPO, RecurrentPPO, and QR-DQN, implemented using Stable Baselines. Each
algorithm was trained for one million steps each on ten Atari 2600 games, and
power consumption was measured in real-time to estimate total energy usage,
CO2-Equivalent emissions, and electricity cost based on the U.S. national
average electricity price. Our results reveal substantial variation in energy
efficiency and training cost across algorithms, with some achieving comparable
performance while consuming up to 24% less energy (ARS vs. DQN), emitting
nearly 68% less CO2, and incurring almost 68% lower monetary cost (QR-DQN vs.
RecurrentPPO) than less efficient counterparts. We further analyze the
trade-offs between learning performance, training time, energy use, and
financial cost, highlighting cases where algorithmic choices can mitigate
environmental and economic impact without sacrificing learning performance.
This study provides actionable insights for developing energy-aware and
cost-efficient DRL practices and establishes a foundation for incorporating
sustainability considerations into future algorithmic design and evaluation.

Abstract: Mainstream Transformer-based large language models face major efficiency
bottlenecks: training computation scales quadratically with sequence length,
and inference memory grows linearly, limiting long-context processing. Building
large models on non-NVIDIA platforms also poses challenges for stable and
efficient training. To address this, we introduce SpikingBrain, a family of
brain-inspired models designed for efficient long-context training and
inference. SpikingBrain leverages the MetaX GPU cluster and focuses on three
aspects: (1) Model Architecture: linear and hybrid-linear attention
architectures with adaptive spiking neurons; (2) Algorithmic Optimizations: an
efficient, conversion-based training pipeline and a dedicated spike coding
framework; (3) System Engineering: customized training frameworks, operator
libraries, and parallelism strategies tailored to MetaX hardware.
  Using these techniques, we develop two models: SpikingBrain-7B, a linear LLM,
and SpikingBrain-76B, a hybrid-linear MoE LLM. These models demonstrate the
feasibility of large-scale LLM development on non-NVIDIA platforms.
SpikingBrain achieves performance comparable to open-source Transformer
baselines while using only about 150B tokens for continual pre-training. Our
models significantly improve long-sequence training efficiency and deliver
inference with (partially) constant memory and event-driven spiking behavior.
For example, SpikingBrain-7B attains over 100x speedup in Time to First Token
for 4M-token sequences. Training remains stable for weeks on hundreds of MetaX
C550 GPUs, with the 7B model reaching a Model FLOPs Utilization of 23.4
percent. The proposed spiking scheme achieves 69.15 percent sparsity, enabling
low-power operation. Overall, this work demonstrates the potential of
brain-inspired mechanisms to drive the next generation of efficient and
scalable large model design.

benchmarked on CASIA 2.0 dataset, our method achieves an accuracy of 77.9%,
outperforming traditional statistical methods. Despite its relatively weaker
performance compared to larger, more complex forgery detection pipelines, our
approach balances computational complexity and detection reliability, making it
ready for practical deployment. It provides a strong methodology for forensic
scrutiny of digital images. In a broader sense, it advances the state of the

Abstract: Distributed optimization is fundamental in large-scale machine learning and
control applications. Among existing methods, the Alternating Direction Method
of Multipliers (ADMM) has gained popularity due to its strong convergence
guarantees and suitability for decentralized computation. However, ADMM often
suffers from slow convergence and sensitivity to hyperparameter choices. In
this work, we show that distributed ADMM iterations can be naturally
represented within the message-passing framework of graph neural networks
(GNNs). Building on this connection, we propose to learn adaptive step sizes
and communication weights by a graph neural network that predicts the
hyperparameters based on the iterates. By unrolling ADMM for a fixed number of
iterations, we train the network parameters end-to-end to minimize the final
iterates error for a given problem class, while preserving the algorithm's
convergence properties. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our learned
variant consistently improves convergence speed and solution quality compared
to standard ADMM. The code is available at

Conclusion: DRL-PUT框架能够有效解决广告推荐系统中的多目标优化问题，实现个性化调整并显著提升业务指标

Abstract: The ranking utility function in an ad recommender system, which linearly
combines predictions of various business goals, plays a central role in
balancing values across the platform, advertisers, and users. Traditional
manual tuning, while offering simplicity and interpretability, often yields
suboptimal results due to its unprincipled tuning objectives, the vast amount
of parameter combinations, and its lack of personalization and adaptability to
seasonality. In this work, we propose a general Deep Reinforcement Learning
framework for Personalized Utility Tuning (DRL-PUT) to address the challenges
of multi-objective optimization within ad recommender systems. Our key
contributions include: 1) Formulating the problem as a reinforcement learning
task: given the state of an ad request, we predict the optimal hyperparameters
to maximize a pre-defined reward. 2) Developing an approach to directly learn
an optimal policy model using online serving logs, avoiding the need to
estimate a value function, which is inherently challenging due to the high
variance and unbalanced distribution of immediate rewards. We evaluated DRL-PUT
through an online A/B experiment in Pinterest's ad recommender system. Compared
to the baseline manual utility tuning approach, DRL-PUT improved the
click-through rate by 9.7% and the long click-through rate by 7.7% on the
treated segment. We conducted a detailed ablation study on the impact of
different reward definitions and analyzed the personalization aspect of the
learned policy model.
