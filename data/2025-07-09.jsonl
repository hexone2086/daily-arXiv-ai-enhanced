Concurrently, scaling data and model size has led to the\ndevelopment of capable language and vision foundation models, motivating\nlarge-scale efforts to create general-purpose robot foundation models. While\nthese models have garnered significant enthusiasm and investment, meaningful\nevaluation of real-world performance remains a challenge, limiting both the\npace of development and inhibiting a nuanced understanding of current\ncapabilities. In this paper, we rigorously evaluate multitask robot\nmanipulation policies, referred to as Large Behavior Models (LBMs), by\nextending the Diffusion Policy paradigm across a corpus of simulated and\nreal-world robot data. We propose and validate an evaluation pipeline to\nrigorously analyze the capabilities of these models with statistical\nconfidence. We compare against single-task baselines through blind, randomized\ntrials in a controlled setting, using both simulation and real-world\nexperiments. We find that multi-task pretraining makes the policies more\nsuccessful and robust, and enables teaching complex new tasks more quickly,\nusing a fraction of the data when compared to single-task baselines.

In contrast, humans learn these properties through\ninteractive multi-sensor exploration. This work proposes fusing visual and\ntactile observations into a unified Gaussian Process Distance Field (GPDF)\nrepresentation for active perception of object properties. While primarily\nfocusing on geometry, this approach also demonstrates potential for modeling\nsurface properties beyond geometry. The GPDF encodes signed distance using\npoint cloud, analytic gradient and Hessian, and surface uncertainty estimates,\nwhich are attributes that common neural network shape representation lack. By\nutilizing a point cloud to construct a distance function, GPDF does not need\nextensive pretraining on large datasets and can incorporate observations by\naggregation. Starting with an initial visual shape estimate, the framework\niteratively refines the geometry by integrating dense vision measurements using\ndifferentiable rendering and tactile measurements at uncertain surface regions.\nBy quantifying multi-sensor uncertainties, it plans exploratory motions to\nmaximize information gain for recovering precise 3D structures. For the\nreal-world robot experiment, we utilize the Franka Research 3 robot\nmanipulator, which is fixed on a table and has a customized DIGIT tactile\nsensor and an Intel Realsense D435 RGBD camera mounted on the end-effector. In\nthese experiments, the robot explores the shape and properties of objects\nassumed to be static and placed on the table. To improve scalability, we\ninvestigate approximation methods like inducing point method for Gaussian\nProcesses.

By tackling these\nsystemic issues, we can unlock more scalable, efficient, and robust training\nmechanisms {with fewer communication rounds for convergence}, paving the way\nfor the widespread deployment of large-scale federated MoE-structured LAMs in\nedge computing with ultra-high communication efficiency."}

In\nthis work, we introduce AutoTriton, the first model dedicated to Triton\nprogramming powered by reinforcement learning (RL).

Specifically, DFYP\nintroduces three key components: (1) a Resolution-aware Channel Attention (RCA)\nmodule that enhances spectral representation by adaptively reweighting input\nchannels based on resolution-specific characteristics; (2) an Adaptive Operator\nLearning Network (AOL-Net) that dynamically selects operators for convolutional\nkernels to improve edge-sensitive spatial feature extraction under varying crop\nand temporal conditions; and (3) a dual-branch architecture with a learnable\nfusion mechanism, which jointly models local spatial details and global\ncontextual information to support cross-resolution and cross-crop\ngeneralization. Extensive experiments on multi-year datasets MODIS and\nmulti-crop dataset Sentinel-2 demonstrate that DFYP consistently outperforms\ncurrent state-of-the-art baselines in RMSE, MAE, and R2 across different\nspatial resolutions, crop types, and time periods, showcasing its effectiveness\nand robustness for real-world agricultural monitoring."}

Consequently, researchers have shifted their focus toward\ngenerating natural, unrestricted adversarial examples (UAEs). GAN-based\napproaches suffer from inherent limitations, such as poor image quality due to\ninstability and mode collapse. Meanwhile, diffusion models have been employed\nfor UAE generation, but they still rely on iterative PGD perturbation\ninjection, without fully leveraging their central denoising capabilities. In\nthis paper, we introduce a novel approach for generating UAEs based on\ndiffusion models, named ScoreAdv. This method incorporates an interpretable\nadversarial guidance mechanism to gradually shift the sampling distribution\ntowards the adversarial distribution, while using an interpretable saliency map\nto inject the visual information of a reference image into the generated\nsamples. Notably, our method is capable of generating an unlimited number of\nnatural adversarial examples and can attack not only classification models but\nalso retrieval models. We conduct extensive experiments on ImageNet and CelebA\ndatasets, validating the performance of ScoreAdv across ten target models in\nboth black-box and white-box settings. Our results demonstrate that ScoreAdv\nachieves state-of-the-art attack success rates and image quality. Furthermore,\nthe dynamic balance between denoising and adversarial perturbation enables\nScoreAdv to remain robust even under defensive measures."}

In\nthis work, we propose a novel generative approach, Generative HMC (GenHMC),\nthat leverages large unpaired HMC captures, which are much easier to collect,\nto directly generate high-quality synthetic HMC images given any conditioning\navatar state from dome captures. We show that our method is able to properly\ndisentangle the input conditioning signal that specifies facial expression and\nviewpoint, from facial appearance, leading to more accurate ground truth.\nFurthermore, our method can generalize to unseen identities, removing the\nreliance on the paired captures. We demonstrate these breakthroughs by both\nevaluating synthetic HMC images and universal face encoders trained from these\nnew HMC-avatar correspondences, which achieve better data efficiency and\nstate-of-the-art accuracy."}

This architectural coupling\namplifies error propagation under semantic ambiguity while restricting model\ngeneralizability and interpretability. To address these issues, we propose\nRSRefSeg 2, a decoupling paradigm that reformulates the conventional workflow\ninto a collaborative dual-stage framework: coarse localization followed by fine\nsegmentation. RSRefSeg 2 integrates CLIP's cross-modal alignment strength with\nSAM's segmentation generalizability through strategic foundation model\ncollaboration.

To mitigate CLIP's misactivation challenges in\nmulti-entity scenarios described by referring texts, a cascaded second-order\nprompter is devised, which enhances precision through implicit reasoning via\ndecomposition of text embeddings into complementary semantic subspaces.
