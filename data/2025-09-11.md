TL;DR: 本文首次对3D和4D世界建模与生成进行全面综述，建立了精确的定义和分类体系，填补了该领域缺乏标准化定义和系统性总结的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注2D图像和视频数据的生成方法，忽视了基于原生3D/4D表示（如RGB-D图像、占据网格、LiDAR点云）的大规模场景建模工作，且缺乏对"世界模型"的标准化定义和分类体系。

Method: 建立了结构化分类体系，涵盖基于视频的方法(VideoGen)、基于占据网格的方法(OccGen)和基于LiDAR的方法(LiDARGen)，并系统总结了适用于3D/4D设置的数据集和评估指标。

Result: 提出了首个专门针对3D和4D世界建模与生成的全面综述，提供了精确的定义、分类框架和系统性文献总结。

Conclusion: 该综述为推进3D/4D世界建模领域提供了连贯的基础性参考，讨论了实际应用、开放挑战和有前景的研究方向。

Abstract: World modeling has become a cornerstone in AI research, enabling agents to
understand, represent, and predict the dynamic environments they inhabit. While
prior work largely emphasizes generative methods for 2D image and video data,
they overlook the rapidly growing body of work that leverages native 3D and 4D
representations such as RGB-D imagery, occupancy grids, and LiDAR point clouds
for large-scale scene modeling. At the same time, the absence of a standardized
definition and taxonomy for ``world models'' has led to fragmented and
sometimes inconsistent claims in the literature. This survey addresses these
gaps by presenting the first comprehensive review explicitly dedicated to 3D
and 4D world modeling and generation. We establish precise definitions,
introduce a structured taxonomy spanning video-based (VideoGen),
occupancy-based (OccGen), and LiDAR-based (LiDARGen) approaches, and
systematically summarize datasets and evaluation metrics tailored to 3D/4D
settings. We further discuss practical applications, identify open challenges,
and highlight promising research directions, aiming to provide a coherent and
foundational reference for advancing the field. A systematic summary of
existing literature is available at https://github.com/worldbench/survey

TL;DR: XFloodNet是一个基于深度学习的城市洪水分类框架，通过多模态特征融合和注意力机制，在三个基准数据集上取得了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统洪水检测方法依赖单模态数据和静态规则系统，无法捕捉洪水事件的动态非线性关系。现有注意力机制和集成学习方法在层次细化、跨模态特征集成和对噪声环境的适应性方面存在局限。

Method: XFloodNet包含三个核心组件：1)层次化跨模态门控注意力机制，动态对齐视觉和文本特征；2)异构卷积自适应多尺度注意力模块，提取频谱和空间域的判别性特征；3)级联卷积Transformer特征细化技术，通过自适应缩放和级联操作协调层次特征。

Result: 在Chennai Floods、Rhine18 Floods和Harz17 Floods三个基准数据集上分别取得了93.33%、82.24%和88.60%的F1分数，显著超越了现有方法。

Conclusion: XFloodNet通过创新的深度学习技术重新定义了城市洪水分类，提供了鲁棒且抗噪声的洪水检测解决方案，在多个数据集上实现了最先进的性能。

Abstract: In an era of escalating climate change, urban flooding has emerged as a
critical challenge for sustainable cities, threatening lives, infrastructure,
and ecosystems. Traditional flood detection methods are constrained by their
reliance on unimodal data and static rule-based systems, which fail to capture
the dynamic, non-linear relationships inherent in flood events. Furthermore,
existing attention mechanisms and ensemble learning approaches exhibit
limitations in hierarchical refinement, cross-modal feature integration, and
adaptability to noisy or unstructured environments, resulting in suboptimal
flood classification performance. To address these challenges, we present
XFloodNet, a novel framework that redefines urban flood classification through
advanced deep-learning techniques. XFloodNet integrates three novel components:
(1) a Hierarchical Cross-Modal Gated Attention mechanism that dynamically
aligns visual and textual features, enabling precise multi-granularity
interactions and resolving contextual ambiguities; (2) a Heterogeneous
Convolutional Adaptive Multi-Scale Attention module, which leverages
frequency-enhanced channel attention and frequency-modulated spatial attention
to extract and prioritize discriminative flood-related features across spectral
and spatial domains; and (3) a Cascading Convolutional Transformer Feature
Refinement technique that harmonizes hierarchical features through adaptive
scaling and cascading operations, ensuring robust and noise-resistant flood
detection. We evaluate our proposed method on three benchmark datasets, such as
Chennai Floods, Rhine18 Floods, and Harz17 Floods, XFloodNet achieves
state-of-the-art F1-scores of 93.33%, 82.24%, and 88.60%, respectively,
surpassing existing methods by significant margins.

TL;DR: 视频并行扩展(VPS)通过多个并行推理流处理不重叠帧序列，在不增加计算成本的情况下提升视频大语言模型的时间分辨能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决VideoLLMs在增加输入帧数时遇到的计算成本暴增和长上下文性能氛困问题

Method: 运行多个并行推理流，每个流处理独立的帧子集，然后聚合各流输出概率得到更丰富的视觉信息

Result: 在2B-32B不同规模模型上均显著提升性能，在Video-MME和EventHallusion等测试集上表现优异，比其他并行方案更有效

Conclusion: VPS提供了一种内存高效、稳健的框架，能够在不需额外训练的情况下提升VideoLLMs的时间推理能力

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) face a critical bottleneck:
increasing the number of input frames to capture fine-grained temporal detail
leads to prohibitive computational costs and performance degradation from long
context lengths. We introduce Video Parallel Scaling (VPS), an inference-time
method that expands a model's perceptual bandwidth without increasing its
context window. VPS operates by running multiple parallel inference streams,
each processing a unique, disjoint subset of the video's frames. By aggregating
the output probabilities from these complementary streams, VPS integrates a
richer set of visual information than is possible with a single pass. We
theoretically show that this approach effectively contracts the Chinchilla
scaling law by leveraging uncorrelated visual evidence, thereby improving
performance without additional training. Extensive experiments across various
model architectures and scales (2B-32B) on benchmarks such as Video-MME and
EventHallusion demonstrate that VPS consistently and significantly improves
performance. It scales more favorably than other parallel alternatives (e.g.
Self-consistency) and is complementary to other decoding strategies, offering a
memory-efficient and robust framework for enhancing the temporal reasoning
capabilities of VideoLLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种多模态立场检测框架，通过分层融合方法整合文本和视觉信息，在气候变化立场检测数据集上取得了76.2%的准确率，优于现有最先进方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着社交媒体内容越来越多地结合文本和视觉元素，现有方法仅关注文本数据已不足以应对现实需求，需要开发先进的多模态方法来处理这种混合内容。

Method: 使用大型语言模型从源文本中提取立场相关摘要，通过领域感知图像标题生成器在目标主题背景下解释视觉内容，然后通过专门的transformer模块联合建模这些模态与回复文本，捕捉文本和图像之间的交互。

Result: 在MultiClimate数据集上评估，取得了76.2%的准确率、76.3%的精确率、76.2%的召回率和76.2%的F1分数，优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 提出的多模态融合框架能够有效整合不同模态信息，实现稳健的立场分类，为解决社交媒体中多模态立场检测问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: With the rapid proliferation of information across digital platforms, stance
detection has emerged as a pivotal challenge in social media analysis. While
most of the existing approaches focus solely on textual data, real-world social
media content increasingly combines text with visual elements creating a need
for advanced multimodal methods. To address this gap, we propose a multimodal
stance detection framework that integrates textual and visual information
through a hierarchical fusion approach. Our method first employs a Large
Language Model to retrieve stance-relevant summaries from source text, while a
domain-aware image caption generator interprets visual content in the context
of the target topic. These modalities are then jointly modeled along with the
reply text, through a specialized transformer module that captures interactions
between the texts and images. The proposed modality fusion framework integrates
diverse modalities to facilitate robust stance classification. We evaluate our
approach on the MultiClimate dataset, a benchmark for climate change-related
stance detection containing aligned video frames and transcripts. We achieve
accuracy of 76.2%, precision of 76.3%, recall of 76.2% and F1-score of 76.2%,
respectively, outperforming existing state-of-the-art approaches.

combines three pre-trained Faster R-CNN feature extractor models (InceptionV3,
ResNet50, GoogLeNet) with five transfer classifiers (KNN, SVM, MLP, C4.5,
Na\"ive Bayes), resulting in 15 different base learners. These are aggregated
via weighted averaging to classify regions as Car, Van, Truck, Bus, or
background. Hyperparameters are optimized with the whale optimization algorithm
to balance accuracy, precision, and recall. Implemented in MATLAB R2020b with
parallel processing, SI-EDTL outperforms existing methods on the AU-AIR UAV
dataset.

### [6] [MCTED: A Machine-Learning-Ready Dataset for Digital Elevation Model Generation From Mars Imagery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08027)

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个名为MCTED的新火星数字高程模型数据集，包含80,898个样本，用于机器学习应用。数据集包含光学图像块、DEM块和掩码块，并提供了统计分析和基准测试结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模DEM处理流程中常见的伪影和缺失数据问题，为火星表面高程预测任务提供高质量的机器学习数据集。

Method: 开发了处理高分辨率火星正射影像和DEM对的综合流程，使用CTX仪器数据，生成包含图像块、DEM块和掩码块的数据样本，并分为训练和验证集以避免数据泄漏。

Result: 训练的小型U-Net架构在火星高程预测任务上表现优于DepthAnythingV2等单目深度估计基础模型的零样本性能。

Conclusion: MCTED数据集为火星数字高程模型预测提供了有价值的资源，即使小型专用模型也能超越大型通用基础模型的零样本性能，数据集和代码已开源。

Abstract: This work presents a new dataset for the Martian digital elevation model
prediction task, ready for machine learning applications called MCTED. The
dataset has been generated using a comprehensive pipeline designed to process
high-resolution Mars orthoimage and DEM pairs from Day et al., yielding a
dataset consisting of 80,898 data samples. The source images are data gathered
by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter using the CTX instrument, providing a very
diverse and comprehensive coverage of the Martian surface. Given the complexity
of the processing pipelines used in large-scale DEMs, there are often artefacts
and missing data points in the original data, for which we developed tools to
solve or mitigate their impact. We divide the processed samples into training
and validation splits, ensuring samples in both splits cover no mutual areas to
avoid data leakage. Every sample in the dataset is represented by the optical
image patch, DEM patch, and two mask patches, indicating values that were
originally missing or were altered by us. This allows future users of the
dataset to handle altered elevation regions as they please. We provide
statistical insights of the generated dataset, including the spatial
distribution of samples, the distributions of elevation values, slopes and
more. Finally, we train a small U-Net architecture on the MCTED dataset and
compare its performance to a monocular depth estimation foundation model,
DepthAnythingV2, on the task of elevation prediction. We find that even a very
small architecture trained on this dataset specifically, beats a zero-shot
performance of a depth estimation foundation model like DepthAnythingV2. We
make the dataset and code used for its generation completely open source in
public repositories.

### [7] [APML: Adaptive Probabilistic Matching Loss for Robust 3D Point Cloud Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08104)
*Sasan Sharifipour,Constantino Álvarez Casado,Mohammad Sabokrou,Miguel Bordallo López*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出APML损失函数，通过可微分的Sinkhorn迭代实现一对一匹配，解决了传统点云损失函数的多对一对应问题，在保持接近二次时间复杂度的情况下显著提升了点云预测任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统点云损失函数（如CD、HyperCD、InfoCD）存在多对一对应问题，导致密集区域点拥挤和稀疏区域覆盖不足；EMD虽然能强制一对一对应但计算复杂度太高（立方级），限制了实际应用。

Method: 提出自适应概率匹配损失（APML），基于温度缩放相似度矩阵的Sinkhorn迭代，实现完全可微分的一对一匹配近似，通过分析计算温度值避免手动调参，达到接近二次的时间复杂度。

Result: 在ShapeNet基准测试和WiFi CSI到3D人体点云生成的时空Transformer上，APML损失实现了更快的收敛速度、更好的空间分布（特别是在低密度区域），以及相当或更好的定量性能，无需额外超参数搜索。

Conclusion: APML损失函数有效解决了传统点云损失函数的局限性，在保持计算效率的同时提供了更准确的一对一匹配，显著提升了点云预测任务的质量和训练效率。

Abstract: Training deep learning models for point cloud prediction tasks such as shape
completion and generation depends critically on loss functions that measure
discrepancies between predicted and ground-truth point sets. Commonly used
functions such as Chamfer Distance (CD), HyperCD, and InfoCD rely on
nearest-neighbor assignments, which often induce many-to-one correspondences,
leading to point congestion in dense regions and poor coverage in sparse
regions. These losses also involve non-differentiable operations due to index
selection, which may affect gradient-based optimization. Earth Mover Distance
(EMD) enforces one-to-one correspondences and captures structural similarity
more effectively, but its cubic computational complexity limits its practical
use. We propose the Adaptive Probabilistic Matching Loss (APML), a fully
differentiable approximation of one-to-one matching that leverages Sinkhorn
iterations on a temperature-scaled similarity matrix derived from pairwise
distances. We analytically compute the temperature to guarantee a minimum
assignment probability, eliminating manual tuning. APML achieves near-quadratic
runtime, comparable to Chamfer-based losses, and avoids non-differentiable
operations. When integrated into state-of-the-art architectures (PoinTr, PCN,
FoldingNet) on ShapeNet benchmarks and on a spatiotemporal Transformer (CSI2PC)
that generates 3D human point clouds from WiFi CSI measurements, APM loss
yields faster convergence, superior spatial distribution, especially in
low-density regions, and improved or on-par quantitative performance without
additional hyperparameter search. The code is available at:
https://github.com/apm-loss/apml.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出L-RPCANet轻量级框架，通过分层瓶颈结构和噪声抑制模块解决红外小目标检测中的参数轻量化和噪声鲁棒性问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度展开网络在红外小目标检测中虽然表现良好，但在参数轻量化和噪声鲁棒性方面仍面临重大挑战

Method: 基于鲁棒主成分分析构建分层瓶颈结构，使用瓶颈层进行特征提取，嵌入噪声抑制模块，并采用SENet通道注意力机制

Result: 在ISTD数据集上的大量实验验证了该方法相比RPCANet、DRPCANet和RPCANet++等先进方法的优越性

Conclusion: L-RPCANet在保持轻量化和鲁棒性的同时实现了优异性能，为红外小目标检测提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: Infrared small target detection (ISTD) is one of the key techniques in image
processing. Although deep unfolding networks (DUNs) have demonstrated promising
performance in ISTD due to their model interpretability and data adaptability,
existing methods still face significant challenges in parameter lightweightness
and noise robustness. In this regard, we propose a highly lightweight framework
based on robust principal component analysis (RPCA) called L-RPCANet.
Technically, a hierarchical bottleneck structure is constructed to reduce and
increase the channel dimension in the single-channel input infrared image to
achieve channel-wise feature refinement, with bottleneck layers designed in
each module to extract features. This reduces the number of channels in feature
extraction and improves the lightweightness of network parameters. Furthermore,
a noise reduction module is embedded to enhance the robustness against complex
noise. In addition, squeeze-and-excitation networks (SENets) are leveraged as a
channel attention mechanism to focus on the varying importance of different
features across channels, thereby achieving excellent performance while
maintaining both lightweightness and robustness. Extensive experiments on the
ISTD datasets validate the superiority of our proposed method compared with
state-of-the-art methods covering RPCANet, DRPCANet, and RPCANet++. The code
will be available at https://github.com/xianchaoxiu/L-RPCANet.

### [9] [Sparse Transformer for Ultra-sparse Sampled Video Compressive Sensing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08228)
*Miao Cao,Siming Zheng,Lishun Wang,Ziyang Chen,David Brady,Xin Yuan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出超稀疇采样(USS)策略和BSTFormer模型，通过降低采样率和利用稀疇性，在视频压缩成像中实现了更高的动态范围和更低的功耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数码相机的功耗在高分辨率高帧率场景下无法持续，需要通过物理层压缩测量来大幅降低单像素功耗。

Method: 提出USS采样策略（每个空间位置只有一个子帧为1），并设计BSTFormer模型，结合局部坐标关注、全局稀疇关注和时间关注来利用USS测量的稀疇性。

Result: 在模拟和实际数据上，方法显著超过以往最优算法，并具有比随机采样更高的动态范围。

Conclusion: USS策略是实现芯片上完整视频SCI系统的良好选择，具有固定曝光时间和优秀的功耗性能。

Abstract: Digital cameras consume ~0.1 microjoule per pixel to capture and encode
video, resulting in a power usage of ~20W for a 4K sensor operating at 30 fps.
Imagining gigapixel cameras operating at 100-1000 fps, the current processing
model is unsustainable. To address this, physical layer compressive measurement
has been proposed to reduce power consumption per pixel by 10-100X. Video
Snapshot Compressive Imaging (SCI) introduces high frequency modulation in the
optical sensor layer to increase effective frame rate. A commonly used sampling
strategy of video SCI is Random Sampling (RS) where each mask element value is
randomly set to be 0 or 1. Similarly, image inpainting (I2P) has demonstrated
that images can be recovered from a fraction of the image pixels. Inspired by
I2P, we propose Ultra-Sparse Sampling (USS) regime, where at each spatial
location, only one sub-frame is set to 1 and all others are set to 0. We then
build a Digital Micro-mirror Device (DMD) encoding system to verify the
effectiveness of our USS strategy. Ideally, we can decompose the USS
measurement into sub-measurements for which we can utilize I2P algorithms to
recover high-speed frames. However, due to the mismatch between the DMD and
CCD, the USS measurement cannot be perfectly decomposed. To this end, we
propose BSTFormer, a sparse TransFormer that utilizes local Block attention,
global Sparse attention, and global Temporal attention to exploit the sparsity
of the USS measurement. Extensive results on both simulated and real-world data
show that our method significantly outperforms all previous state-of-the-art
algorithms. Additionally, an essential advantage of the USS strategy is its
higher dynamic range than that of the RS strategy. Finally, from the
application perspective, the USS strategy is a good choice to implement a
complete video SCI system on chip due to its fixed exposure time.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频异常检测方法难以检测致命事件（如枪击、刺伤），主要因为这些事件罕见且数据收集存在伦理问题

Method: 使用GTA5游戏构建致命暴力数据集，包含多视角CCTV视频；提出基于Wasserstein对抗训练的片段级域适应策略，弥合合成数据与真实数据特征差距

Result: 实验验证了GTA-Crime数据集的有效性，结合域适应策略能持续提升真实世界致命暴力检测准确率

Conclusion: GTA-Crime为解决致命暴力检测的数据稀缺和伦理限制提供了可行方案，公开的数据集和生成框架有助于推动该领域研究

Abstract: Recent advancements in video anomaly detection (VAD) have enabled
identification of various criminal activities in surveillance videos, but
detecting fatal incidents such as shootings and stabbings remains difficult due
to their rarity and ethical issues in data collection. Recognizing this
limitation, we introduce GTA-Crime, a fatal video anomaly dataset and
generation framework using Grand Theft Auto 5 (GTA5). Our dataset contains
fatal situations such as shootings and stabbings, captured from CCTV multiview
perspectives under diverse conditions including action types, weather, time of
day, and viewpoints. To address the rarity of such scenarios, we also release a
framework for generating these types of videos. Additionally, we propose a
snippet-level domain adaptation strategy using Wasserstein adversarial training
to bridge the gap between synthetic GTA-Crime features and real-world features
like UCF-Crime. Experimental results validate our GTA-Crime dataset and
demonstrate that incorporating GTA-Crime with our domain adaptation strategy
consistently enhances real world fatal violence detection accuracy. Our dataset
and the data generation framework are publicly available at

TL;DR: 提出RepViT-CXR方法，通过通道复制策略将单通道胸部X光图像适配到ViT架构，在TB和肺炎检测任务上达到SOTA性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Vision Transformers在医学影像分析中的适配问题，因为ViT通常需要三通道输入而CXR是灰度单通道图像

Method: 采用通道复制策略将单通道CXR图像转换为ViT兼容的三通道格式，不引入额外信息损失

Result: 在三个基准数据集上表现优异：TB-CXR数据集准确率99.9%、AUC 99.9%；儿科肺炎数据集准确率99.0%、AUC 99.0%；深圳TB数据集准确率91.1%、AUC 91.2%

Conclusion: 简单有效的通道复制策略能让ViT在灰度医学影像任务中充分发挥表征能力，具有实际临床部署潜力

Abstract: Chest X-ray (CXR) imaging remains one of the most widely used diagnostic
tools for detecting pulmonary diseases such as tuberculosis (TB) and pneumonia.
Recent advances in deep learning, particularly Vision Transformers (ViTs), have
shown strong potential for automated medical image analysis. However, most ViT
architectures are pretrained on natural images and require three-channel
inputs, while CXR scans are inherently grayscale. To address this gap, we
propose RepViT-CXR, a channel replication strategy that adapts single-channel
CXR images into a ViT-compatible format without introducing additional
information loss. We evaluate RepViT-CXR on three benchmark datasets. On the
TB-CXR dataset,our method achieved an accuracy of 99.9% and an AUC of 99.9%,
surpassing prior state-of-the-art methods such as Topo-CXR (99.3% accuracy,
99.8% AUC). For the Pediatric Pneumonia dataset, RepViT-CXR obtained 99.0%
accuracy, with 99.2% recall, 99.3% precision, and an AUC of 99.0%,
outperforming strong baselines including DCNN and VGG16. On the Shenzhen TB
dataset, our approach achieved 91.1% accuracy and an AUC of 91.2%, marking a
performance improvement over previously reported CNN-based methods. These
results demonstrate that a simple yet effective channel replication strategy
allows ViTs to fully leverage their representational power on grayscale medical
imaging tasks. RepViT-CXR establishes a new state of the art for TB and
pneumonia detection from chest X-rays, showing strong potential for deployment
in real-world clinical screening systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究大多基于预训练或忽略脑部疾病引起的不对称特征，需要开发能够关注AD引起的结构性不对称变化的诊断方法。

Method: 使用3D CNN编码器提取特征，通过对称交互Transformer(SIT)处理左右半球对齐特征，重点关注脑萎缩引起的不对称区域。

Conclusion: 该方法通过关注AD引起的结构性不对称特征，提高了诊断性能并具有良好的可解释性，证明了方法的有效性和实用性。

Abstract: Structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) combined with deep learning has
achieved remarkable progress in the prediction and diagnosis of Alzheimer's
disease (AD). Existing studies have used CNN and transformer to build a
well-performing network, but most of them are based on pretraining or ignoring
the asymmetrical character caused by brain disorders. We propose an end-to-end
network for the detection of disease-based asymmetric induced by left and right
brain atrophy which consist of 3D CNN Encoder and Symmetry Interactive
Transformer (SIT). Following the inter-equal grid block fetch operation, the
corresponding left and right hemisphere features are aligned and subsequently
fed into the SIT for diagnostic analysis. SIT can help the model focus more on
the regions of asymmetry caused by structural changes, thus improving
diagnostic performance. We evaluated our method based on the ADNI dataset, and
the results show that the method achieves better diagnostic accuracy (92.5\%)
compared to several CNN methods and CNNs combined with a general transformer.
The visualization results show that our network pays more attention in regions
of brain atrophy, especially for the asymmetric pathological characteristics
induced by AD, demonstrating the interpretability and effectiveness of the
method.

Abstract: Frame-based cameras with extended exposure times often produce perceptible
visual blurring and information loss between frames, significantly degrading
video quality. To address this challenge, we introduce EVDI++, a unified
self-supervised framework for Event-based Video Deblurring and Interpolation
that leverages the high temporal resolution of event cameras to mitigate motion
blur and enable intermediate frame prediction. Specifically, the Learnable
Double Integral (LDI) network is designed to estimate the mapping relation
between reference frames and sharp latent images. Then, we refine the coarse
results and optimize overall training efficiency by introducing a
learning-based division reconstruction module, enabling images to be converted
with varying exposure intervals. We devise an adaptive parameter-free fusion
strategy to obtain the final results, utilizing the confidence embedded in the
LDI outputs of concurrent events. A self-supervised learning framework is
proposed to enable network training with real-world blurry videos and events by
exploring the mutual constraints among blurry frames, latent images, and event
streams. We further construct a dataset with real-world blurry images and
events using a DAVIS346c camera, demonstrating the generalizability of the
proposed EVDI++ in real-world scenarios. Extensive experiments on both
synthetic and real-world datasets show that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance in video deblurring and interpolation tasks.

TL;DR: 提出HyMamba网络，通过状态空间模块统一光谱、跨深度和时间建模，在7个基准数据集上实现最先进的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有高光谱跟踪器无法有效捕获固有光谱信息、时间依赖性和跨深度交互，需要新的解决方案

Method: 基于状态空间模块(SSMs)构建HyMamba网络，包含光谱状态集成(SSI)模块和高光谱Mamba(HSM)模块，通过三向扫描SSMs同步学习空间和光谱信息

Result: 在HOTC2020数据集上达到73.0%的AUC分数和96.3%的DP@20分数，在7个基准数据集上表现最优

Conclusion: HyMamba通过统一的光谱、跨深度和时间建模，有效解决了高光谱目标跟踪中的关键挑战，实现了卓越性能

Abstract: Hyperspectral object tracking holds great promise due to the rich spectral
information and fine-grained material distinctions in hyperspectral images,
which are beneficial in challenging scenarios. While existing hyperspectral
trackers have made progress by either transforming hyperspectral data into
false-color images or incorporating modality fusion strategies, they often fail
to capture the intrinsic spectral information, temporal dependencies, and
cross-depth interactions. To address these limitations, a new hyperspectral
object tracking network equipped with Mamba (HyMamba), is proposed. It unifies
spectral, cross-depth, and temporal modeling through state space modules
(SSMs). The core of HyMamba lies in the Spectral State Integration (SSI)
module, which enables progressive refinement and propagation of spectral
features with cross-depth and temporal spectral information. Embedded within
each SSI, the Hyperspectral Mamba (HSM) module is introduced to learn spatial
and spectral information synchronously via three directional scanning SSMs.
Based on SSI and HSM, HyMamba constructs joint features from false-color and
hyperspectral inputs, and enhances them through interaction with original
spectral features extracted from raw hyperspectral images. Extensive
experiments conducted on seven benchmark datasets demonstrate that HyMamba
achieves state-of-the-art performance. For instance, it achieves 73.0\% of the
AUC score and 96.3\% of the DP@20 score on the HOTC2020 dataset. The code will
be released at https://github.com/lgao001/HyMamba.

TL;DR: VLMs存在固有偏见，当面对需要关注图像特定区域的精确问题时，会忽略视觉证据而依赖训练偏差。研究开发了多维分析框架来系统评估输入数据特征如何影响VLM性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究表明VLMs在处理需要关注图像特定细节的精确问题时，会过度依赖训练中的固有偏见而忽略实际视觉证据，导致性能下降。需要系统分析输入特征如何影响VLM行为。

Method: 使用开源VLMs，开发多维分析框架，系统研究图像大小、物体数量、背景颜色、提示词特异性等输入参数变化对注意力值和模型性能的影响。

Result: 研究发现即使图像特征和提示词特异性的微小变化也会导致VLM答案生成方式和整体性能的显著变化，表明模型对输入参数高度敏感。

Conclusion: VLMs对输入特征的变化极其敏感，需要开发更好的方法来表征和理解这种敏感性，以提高模型在处理精确视觉问题时的可靠性。

Abstract: Recent research on Vision Language Models (VLMs) suggests that they rely on
inherent biases learned during training to respond to questions about visual
properties of an image. These biases are exacerbated when VLMs are asked highly
specific questions that require focusing on specific areas of the image. For
example, a VLM tasked with counting stars on a modified American flag (e.g.,
with more than 50 stars) will often disregard the visual evidence and fail to
answer accurately. We build upon this research and develop a multi-dimensional
examination framework to systematically determine which characteristics of the
input data, including both the image and the accompanying prompt, lead to such
differences in performance. Using open-source VLMs, we further examine how
attention values fluctuate with varying input parameters (e.g., image size,
number of objects in the image, background color, prompt specificity). This
research aims to learn how the behavior of vision language models changes and
to explore methods for characterizing such changes. Our results suggest, among
other things, that even minor modifications in image characteristics and prompt
specificity can lead to large changes in how a VLM formulates its answer and,
subsequently, its overall performance.

Conclusion: E3DPC-GZSL有效解决了3D点云零样本分割中的偏见预测问题，无需为已见和未见数据使用单独分类器，取得了优异性能。

Abstract: Generalized zero-shot semantic segmentation of 3D point clouds aims to
classify each point into both seen and unseen classes. A significant challenge
with these models is their tendency to make biased predictions, often favoring
the classes encountered during training. This problem is more pronounced in 3D
applications, where the scale of the training data is typically smaller than in
image-based tasks. To address this problem, we propose a novel method called
E3DPC-GZSL, which reduces overconfident predictions towards seen classes
without relying on separate classifiers for seen and unseen data. E3DPC-GZSL
tackles the overconfidence problem by integrating an evidence-based uncertainty
estimator into a classifier. This estimator is then used to adjust prediction
probabilities using a dynamic calibrated stacking factor that accounts for
pointwise prediction uncertainty. In addition, E3DPC-GZSL introduces a novel
training strategy that improves uncertainty estimation by refining the semantic
space. This is achieved by merging learnable parameters with text-derived
features, thereby improving model optimization for unseen data. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art
performance on generalized zero-shot semantic segmentation datasets, including
ScanNet v2 and S3DIS.

Motivation: 现有的弱监督物体检测方法存在三个主要问题：1）伪GT框要么只关注区别性部分要么无法区分相邻的同类实例；2）WSDDN网络缺乏背景类表征并存在语义间隔；3）忽略建议框导致收敛慢。

Method: 提出了三个核心组件：1）热力图导向的建议框选择算法(HGPS)，利用双阈值预选建议框；2）弱监督基础检测网络(WSBDN)，为每个建议框添加背景类表征并使用热力图进行预监督；3）在忽略建议框上引入负确定性监督损失。

Conclusion: 本文提出的方法有效解决了弱监督物体检测中的关键挑战，在不需要框级标注的情况下实现了独创性的检测性能，为该领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Weakly supervised object detection (WSOD) has attracted significant attention
in recent years, as it does not require box-level annotations. State-of-the-art
methods generally adopt a multi-module network, which employs WSDDN as the
multiple instance detection network module and multiple instance refinement
modules to refine performance. However, these approaches suffer from three key
limitations. First, existing methods tend to generate pseudo GT boxes that
either focus only on discriminative parts, failing to capture the whole object,
or cover the entire object but fail to distinguish between adjacent intra-class
instances. Second, the foundational WSDDN architecture lacks a crucial
background class representation for each proposal and exhibits a large semantic
gap between its branches. Third, prior methods discard ignored proposals during
optimization, leading to slow convergence. To address these challenges, we
first design a heatmap-guided proposal selector (HGPS) algorithm, which
utilizes dual thresholds on heatmaps to pre-select proposals, enabling pseudo
GT boxes to both capture the full object extent and distinguish between
adjacent intra-class instances. We then present a weakly supervised basic
detection network (WSBDN), which augments each proposal with a background class
representation and uses heatmaps for pre-supervision to bridge the semantic gap
between matrices. At last, we introduce a negative certainty supervision loss
on ignored proposals to accelerate convergence. Extensive experiments on the
challenging PASCAL VOC 2007 and 2012 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of
our framework. We achieve mAP/mCorLoc scores of 58.5%/81.8% on VOC 2007 and
55.6%/80.5% on VOC 2012, performing favorably against the state-of-the-art WSOD
methods. Our code is publicly available at

Abstract: Oil palm cultivation remains one of the leading causes of deforestation in
Indonesia. To better track and address this challenge, detailed and reliable
mapping is needed to support sustainability efforts and emerging regulatory
frameworks. We present an open-access geospatial dataset of oil palm
plantations and related land cover types in Indonesia, produced through expert
labeling of high-resolution satellite imagery from 2020 to 2024. The dataset
provides polygon-based, wall-to-wall annotations across a range of
agro-ecological zones and includes a hierarchical typology that distinguishes
oil palm planting stages as well as similar perennial crops. Quality was
ensured through multi-interpreter consensus and field validation. The dataset
was created using wall-to-wall digitization over large grids, making it
suitable for training and benchmarking both conventional convolutional neural
networks and newer geospatial foundation models. Released under a CC-BY
license, it fills a key gap in training data for remote sensing and aims to
improve the accuracy of land cover types mapping. By supporting transparent
monitoring of oil palm expansion, the resource contributes to global
deforestation reduction goals and follows FAIR data principles.

Conclusion: SimCroP框架能有效捕捉稀疏放射影像中的关键病理结构，在多尺度下游任务中表现出优异性能。

Abstract: Medical vision-language pre-training shows great potential in learning
representative features from massive paired radiographs and reports. However,
in computed tomography (CT) scans, the distribution of lesions which contain
intricate structures is characterized by spatial sparsity. Besides, the complex
and implicit relationships between different pathological descriptions in each
sentence of the report and their corresponding sub-regions in radiographs pose
additional challenges. In this paper, we propose a Similarity-Driven
Cross-Granularity Pre-training (SimCroP) framework on chest CTs, which combines
similarity-driven alignment and cross-granularity fusion to improve radiograph
interpretation. We first leverage multi-modal masked modeling to optimize the
encoder for understanding precise low-level semantics from radiographs. Then,
similarity-driven alignment is designed to pre-train the encoder to adaptively
select and align the correct patches corresponding to each sentence in reports.
The cross-granularity fusion module integrates multimodal information across
instance level and word-patch level, which helps the model better capture key
pathology structures in sparse radiographs, resulting in improved performance
for multi-scale downstream tasks. SimCroP is pre-trained on a large-scale
paired CT-reports dataset and validated on image classification and
segmentation tasks across five public datasets. Experimental results
demonstrate that SimCroP outperforms both cutting-edge medical self-supervised
learning methods and medical vision-language pre-training methods. Codes and
models are available at https://github.com/ToniChopp/SimCroP.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 资源受限平台上实时图像分类需要在精度与延迟/功耗间取得平衡。传统早期退出训练存在协方差偏移问题：下游分支在全数据集上训练，但推理时只处理更难样本，限制了实际效率-精度权衡

Method: BTS-EE顺序训练方法：逐分支训练和校准，使分支训练与推理时数据分布对齐；提出基于1D卷积的轻量分支架构和Class Precision Margin（CPM）校准方法，支持每类阈值调优

Result: 在CINIC-10数据集ResNet18骨干网络上，BTS-EE在64种配置下均优于非增强训练，最高减少45%计算量，精度仅下降2%

Conclusion: 该方法扩展了CNN在实时图像处理系统中的部署设计空间，为工业检测、嵌入式视觉和无人机监控等应用提供实用效率增益

Abstract: Real-time image classification on resource-constrained platforms demands
inference methods that balance accuracy with strict latency and power budgets.
Early-exit strategies address this need by attaching auxiliary classifiers to
intermediate layers of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), allowing "easy"
samples to terminate inference early. However, conventional training of early
exits introduces a covariance shift: downstream branches are trained on full
datasets, while at inference they process only the harder, non-exited samples.
This mismatch limits efficiency--accuracy trade-offs in practice. We introduce
the Boosted Training Scheme for Early Exits (BTS-EE), a sequential training
approach that aligns branch training with inference-time data distributions.
Each branch is trained and calibrated before the next, ensuring robustness
under selective inference conditions. To further support embedded deployment,
we propose a lightweight branch architecture based on 1D convolutions and a
Class Precision Margin (CPM) calibration method that enables per-class
threshold tuning for reliable exit decisions. Experiments on the CINIC-10
dataset with a ResNet18 backbone demonstrate that BTS-EE consistently
outperforms non-boosted training across 64 configurations, achieving up to 45
percent reduction in computation with only 2 percent accuracy degradation.
These results expand the design space for deploying CNNs in real-time image
processing systems, offering practical efficiency gains for applications such
as industrial inspection, embedded vision, and UAV-based monitoring.

Abstract: Accurate and early diagnosis of malignant melanoma is critical for improving
patient outcomes. While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown promise
in dermoscopic image analysis, they often neglect clinical metadata and require
extensive preprocessing. Vision-language models (VLMs) offer a multimodal
alternative but struggle to capture clinical specificity when trained on
general-domain data. To address this, we propose a retrieval-augmented VLM
framework that incorporates semantically similar patient cases into the
diagnostic prompt. Our method enables informed predictions without fine-tuning
and significantly improves classification accuracy and error correction over
conventional baselines. These results demonstrate that retrieval-augmented
prompting provides a robust strategy for clinical decision support.

Abstract: Three-dimensional Object Detection from multi-view cameras and LiDAR is a
crucial component for autonomous driving and smart transportation. However, in
the process of basic feature extraction, perspective transformation, and
feature fusion, noise and error will gradually accumulate. To address this
issue, we propose InsFusion, which can extract proposals from both raw and

mitigating the impact of accumulated errors. Additionally, by incorporating
attention mechanisms applied to the raw features, it thereby mitigates the
impact of accumulated errors. Experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate
that InsFusion is compatible with various advanced baseline methods and
delivers new state-of-the-art performance for 3D object detection.

Abstract: We propose a novel and general framework to disentangle video data into its
dynamic motion and static content components. Our proposed method is a
self-supervised pipeline with less assumptions and inductive biases than
previous works: it utilizes a transformer-based architecture to jointly
generate flexible implicit features for frame-wise motion and clip-wise
content, and incorporates a low-bitrate vector quantization as an information
bottleneck to promote disentanglement and form a meaningful discrete motion
space. The bitrate-controlled latent motion and content are used as conditional
inputs to a denoising diffusion model to facilitate self-supervised
representation learning. We validate our disentangled representation learning
framework on real-world talking head videos with motion transfer and
auto-regressive motion generation tasks. Furthermore, we also show that our
method can generalize to other types of video data, such as pixel sprites of 2D
cartoon characters. Our work presents a new perspective on self-supervised
learning of disentangled video representations, contributing to the broader
field of video analysis and generation.

Abstract: Vision-based 3D semantic occupancy prediction is a critical task in 3D vision
that integrates volumetric 3D reconstruction with semantic understanding.
Existing methods, however, often rely on modular pipelines. These modules are
typically optimized independently or use pre-configured inputs, leading to
cascading errors. In this paper, we address this limitation by designing a
novel causal loss that enables holistic, end-to-end supervision of the modular
2D-to-3D transformation pipeline. Grounded in the principle of 2D-to-3D
semantic causality, this loss regulates the gradient flow from 3D voxel
representations back to the 2D features. Consequently, it renders the entire
pipeline differentiable, unifying the learning process and making previously
non-trainable components fully learnable. Building on this principle, we
propose the Semantic Causality-Aware 2D-to-3D Transformation, which comprises
three components guided by our causal loss: Channel-Grouped Lifting for
adaptive semantic mapping, Learnable Camera Offsets for enhanced robustness
against camera perturbations, and Normalized Convolution for effective feature
propagation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the Occ3D benchmark, demonstrating significant
robustness to camera perturbations and improved 2D-to-3D semantic consistency.

Conclusion: VRAE架构能有效增强交通监控图像质量，显著改善车牌识别性能，计算开销小，适合实时应用

Abstract: In real-world traffic surveillance, vehicle images captured under adverse
weather, poor lighting, or high-speed motion often suffer from severe noise and
blur. Such degradations significantly reduce the accuracy of license plate
recognition systems, especially when the plate occupies only a small region
within the full vehicle image. Restoring these degraded images a fast realtime
manner is thus a crucial pre-processing step to enhance recognition
performance. In this work, we propose a Vertical Residual Autoencoder (VRAE)
architecture designed for the image enhancement task in traffic surveillance.
The method incorporates an enhancement strategy that employs an auxiliary
block, which injects input-aware features at each encoding stage to guide the
representation learning process, enabling better general information
preservation throughout the network compared to conventional autoencoders.
Experiments on a vehicle image dataset with visible license plates demonstrate
that our method consistently outperforms Autoencoder (AE), Generative
Adversarial Network (GAN), and Flow-Based (FB) approaches. Compared with AE at
the same depth, it improves PSNR by about 20\%, reduces NMSE by around 50\%,
and enhances SSIM by 1\%, while requiring only a marginal increase of roughly
1\% in parameters.

Motivation: 多视角多目标跟踪中，由于视角变化、光照变化和遮挡等因素，跨摄像头保持目标身份一致性具有挑战性。传统的BEV投影方法虽然能提高抗遮挡鲁棒性，但会引入特征失真和非均匀密度问题，降低检测和跟踪精度。

Conclusion: SCFusion有效缓解了传统BEV投影方法的局限性，为多视角目标检测和跟踪提供了鲁棒且准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-View Multi-Object Tracking (MVMOT) is essential for applications such
as surveillance, autonomous driving, and sports analytics. However, maintaining
consistent object identities across multiple cameras remains challenging due to
viewpoint changes, lighting variations, and occlusions, which often lead to
tracking errors.Recent methods project features from multiple cameras into a
unified Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) space to improve robustness against occlusion.
However, this projection introduces feature distortion and non-uniform density
caused by variations in object scale with distance. These issues degrade the
quality of the fused representation and reduce detection and tracking
accuracy.To address these problems, we propose SCFusion, a framework that
combines three techniques to improve multi-view feature integration. First, it
applies a sparse transformation to avoid unnatural interpolation during
projection. Next, it performs density-aware weighting to adaptively fuse
features based on spatial confidence and camera distance. Finally, it
introduces a multi-view consistency loss that encourages each camera to learn
discriminative features independently before fusion.Experiments show that
SCFusion achieves state-of-the-art performance, reaching an IDF1 score of 95.9%
on WildTrack and a MODP of 89.2% on MultiviewX, outperforming the baseline
method TrackTacular. These results demonstrate that SCFusion effectively
mitigates the limitations of conventional BEV projection and provides a robust
and accurate solution for multi-view object detection and tracking.

TL;DR: LD-ViCE是一个基于潜在扩散模型的视频反事实解释框架，通过在潜在空间中操作降低计算成本，同时生成真实且可解释的反事实解释，在多个视频数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频AI系统在安全关键领域应用广泛，但现有解释技术存在时间连贯性不足、鲁棒性差、缺乏因果洞察等问题，且现有反事实解释方法通常不结合目标模型指导，降低了语义保真度和实用性。

Method: LD-ViCE使用最先进的扩散模型在潜在空间中操作，通过额外的精炼步骤生成真实且可解释的反事实解释，显著降低了生成解释的计算成本。

Result: 在三个不同视频数据集（EchoNet-Dynamic、FERV39k、Something-Something V2）上的实验表明，LD-ViCE优于现有最先进方法，R2分数提升高达68%，同时推理时间减少一半。定性分析确认其生成语义有意义且时间连贯的解释。

Conclusion: LD-ViCE代表了在安全关键领域可信AI部署的重要一步，能够为目标模型行为提供有价值的洞察。

Abstract: Video-based AI systems are increasingly adopted in safety-critical domains
such as autonomous driving and healthcare. However, interpreting their
decisions remains challenging due to the inherent spatiotemporal complexity of
video data and the opacity of deep learning models. Existing explanation
techniques often suffer from limited temporal coherence, insufficient
robustness, and a lack of actionable causal insights. Current counterfactual
explanation methods typically do not incorporate guidance from the target
model, reducing semantic fidelity and practical utility. We introduce Latent
Diffusion for Video Counterfactual Explanations (LD-ViCE), a novel framework
designed to explain the behavior of video-based AI models. Compared to previous
approaches, LD-ViCE reduces the computational costs of generating explanations
by operating in latent space using a state-of-the-art diffusion model, while
producing realistic and interpretable counterfactuals through an additional
refinement step. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of LD-ViCE
across three diverse video datasets, including EchoNet-Dynamic (cardiac
ultrasound), FERV39k (facial expression), and Something-Something V2 (action
recognition). LD-ViCE outperforms a recent state-of-the-art method, achieving
an increase in R2 score of up to 68% while reducing inference time by half.
Qualitative analysis confirms that LD-ViCE generates semantically meaningful
and temporally coherent explanations, offering valuable insights into the
target model behavior. LD-ViCE represents a valuable step toward the
trustworthy deployment of AI in safety-critical domains.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了HyperTTA框架，通过多退化高光谱数据集、光谱-空间Transformer分类器和轻量级测试时适应策略，显著提升了高光谱图像分类模型在各种退化条件下的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高光谱图像分类模型对噪声、模糊、压缩和大气效应等现实世界退化引起的分布偏移高度敏感，需要提高模型在各种退化条件下的鲁棒性。

Method: 1) 构建包含9种代表性退化的多退化高光谱数据集；2) 设计具有多级感受野机制和标签平滑正则化的光谱-空间Transformer分类器；3) 提出置信度感知的熵最小化LayerNorm适配器(CELA)进行轻量级测试时适应。

Result: 在两个基准数据集上的大量实验表明，HyperTTA在各种退化场景下均优于现有基线方法，验证了其分类主干和TTA方案的有效性。

Conclusion: HyperTTA框架通过系统化的数据集构建、先进的分类器设计和轻量级自适应策略，成功解决了高光谱图像分类中的分布偏移问题，为实际应用提供了鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Hyperspectral image (HSI) classification models are highly sensitive to
distribution shifts caused by various real-world degradations such as noise,
blur, compression, and atmospheric effects. To address this challenge, we
propose HyperTTA, a unified framework designed to enhance model robustness
under diverse degradation conditions. Specifically, we first construct a
multi-degradation hyperspectral dataset that systematically simulates nine
representative types of degradations, providing a comprehensive benchmark for
robust classification evaluation. Based on this, we design a spectral-spatial
transformer classifier (SSTC) enhanced with a multi-level receptive field
mechanism and label smoothing regularization to jointly capture multi-scale
spatial context and improve generalization. Furthermore, HyperTTA incorporates
a lightweight test-time adaptation (TTA) strategy, the confidence-aware
entropy-minimized LayerNorm adapter (CELA), which updates only the affine
parameters of LayerNorm layers by minimizing prediction entropy on
high-confidence unlabeled target samples. This confidence-aware adaptation
prevents unreliable updates from noisy predictions, enabling robust and dynamic
adaptation without access to source data or target annotations. Extensive
experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that HyperTTA outperforms
existing baselines across a wide range of degradation scenarios, validating the
effectiveness of both its classification backbone and the proposed TTA scheme.
Code will be made available publicly.

TL;DR: 提出SBDM模型，通过球形布朗桥扩散过程预测个体化高分辨率皮层厚度轨迹，在ADNI和OASIS数据集上显著降低预测误差


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 精确预测个体化高分辨率皮层厚度轨迹对于检测细微皮层变化、理解神经退行性过程和实现早期精准干预至关重要，但由于皮层复杂非欧几何特性和多模态数据整合需求而具有挑战性

Method: 提出球形布朗桥扩散模型(SBDM)，使用双向条件布朗桥扩散过程在配准皮层表面顶点级别预测皮层厚度轨迹，开发条件球形U-Net(CoS-UNet)去噪模型，结合球形卷积和密集交叉注意力整合皮层表面和表格条件

Result: 相比先前方法显著降低预测误差，在ADNI和OASIS纵向数据集上验证有效，能够生成个体事实和反事实皮层厚度轨迹

Conclusion: SBDM为探索皮层发育假设情景提供了新颖框架，在皮层厚度预测方面表现出优越性能

Abstract: Accurate forecasting of individualized, high-resolution cortical thickness
(CTh) trajectories is essential for detecting subtle cortical changes,
providing invaluable insights into neurodegenerative processes and facilitating
earlier and more precise intervention strategies. However, CTh forecasting is a
challenging task due to the intricate non-Euclidean geometry of the cerebral
cortex and the need to integrate multi-modal data for subject-specific
predictions. To address these challenges, we introduce the Spherical Brownian
Bridge Diffusion Model (SBDM). Specifically, we propose a bidirectional
conditional Brownian bridge diffusion process to forecast CTh trajectories at
the vertex level of registered cortical surfaces. Our technical contribution
includes a new denoising model, the conditional spherical U-Net (CoS-UNet),
which combines spherical convolutions and dense cross-attention to integrate
cortical surfaces and tabular conditions seamlessly. Compared to previous
approaches, SBDM achieves significantly reduced prediction errors, as
demonstrated by our experiments based on longitudinal datasets from the ADNI
and OASIS. Additionally, we demonstrate SBDM's ability to generate individual
factual and counterfactual CTh trajectories, offering a novel framework for
exploring hypothetical scenarios of cortical development.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Mamba视觉模型主要关注网络架构和扫描路径，而对SSM模块本身的研究不足。为了挖掘SSM的潜力，需要改进SSM的计算过程来提升轻量级超分辨率任务的性能。

Method: 引入一阶保持条件到SSM中，推导新的离散化形式，并分析累积误差。通过改进Mamba模块来增强token相关性，从而提升性能。

Result: 在五个基准数据集上，FSSM显著提升了MambaIR的性能，超越了当前的轻量级超分辨率方法，达到了最先进的结果，且没有额外增加参数量。

Conclusion: FSSM通过改进SSM的离散化过程和引入一阶保持条件，有效提升了Mamba在视觉任务中的性能，证明了SSM模块本身优化的重要性，为轻量级超分辨率任务提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: State space models (SSMs), particularly Mamba, have shown promise in NLP
tasks and are increasingly applied to vision tasks. However, most Mamba-based
vision models focus on network architecture and scan paths, with little
attention to the SSM module. In order to explore the potential of SSMs, we
modified the calculation process of SSM without increasing the number of
parameters to improve the performance on lightweight super-resolution tasks. In
this paper, we introduce the First-order State Space Model (FSSM) to improve
the original Mamba module, enhancing performance by incorporating token
correlations. We apply a first-order hold condition in SSMs, derive the new
discretized form, and analyzed cumulative error. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate that FSSM improves the performance of MambaIR on five benchmark
datasets without additionally increasing the number of parameters, and
surpasses current lightweight SR methods, achieving state-of-the-art results.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对比自监督学习在平衡数据集上表现良好，但在不平衡数据集上泛化能力不足，需要扩展多视图框架来提取尾部类别的代表性特征

Method: 基于互信息理论提出多视图（超过两个视图）目标函数，通过分离类内和类间判别特征来提取尾部类别特征，引入新的损失函数过滤极端特征

Result: 在多个自监督框架上验证有效：Cifar10-LT提升2%（Resnet-18），Cifar100-LT提升5%（Resnet-18），Imagenet-LT提升3%（Resnet-50）

Conclusion: 多视图目标函数能有效提升自监督学习在不平衡数据集上的性能，为处理数据集不平衡问题提供了新的理论和方法基础

Abstract: The robustness of contrastive self-supervised learning (CSSL) for imbalanced
datasets is largely unexplored. CSSL usually makes use of \emph{multi-view}
assumptions to learn discriminatory features via similar and dissimilar data
samples. CSSL works well on balanced datasets, but does not generalize well for
imbalanced datasets. In a very recent paper, as part of future work, Yann LeCun
pointed out that the self-supervised multiview framework can be extended to
cases involving \emph{more than two views}. Taking a cue from this insight we
propose a theoretical justification based on the concept of \emph{mutual
information} to support the \emph{more than two views} objective and apply it
to the problem of dataset imbalance in self-supervised learning. The proposed
method helps extract representative characteristics of the tail classes by
segregating between \emph{intra} and \emph{inter} discriminatory
characteristics. We introduce a loss function that helps us to learn better
representations by filtering out extreme features. Experimental evaluation on a
variety of self-supervised frameworks (both contrastive and non-contrastive)
also prove that the \emph{more than two view} objective works well for
imbalanced datasets. We achieve a new state-of-the-art accuracy in
self-supervised imbalanced dataset classification (2\% improvement in
Cifar10-LT using Resnet-18, 5\% improvement in Cifar100-LT using Resnet-18, 3\%
improvement in Imagenet-LT (1k) using Resnet-50).

Motivation: 将多个计算机视觉任务统一到单个自然语言提示驱动的流程中，提高系统的可用性和可调试性

Method: 组合开放词汇检测、可提示分割、文本条件塞光和视觉语言描述的统一流水线，包含交互式UI和脚本化CLI

Result: 在单词提示测试中，检测和分割的可用性达90%以上，准确率超15%；塞光占总运行时间60-75%，需要精心调优

Conclusion: 提供了一个透明、可靠的模式，通过明确的拦栏和运维实践提高对象替换、场景增强和移除任务的可靠性

Abstract: Prompt-driven image analysis converts a single natural-language instruction
into multiple steps: locate, segment, edit, and describe. We present a
practical case study of a unified pipeline that combines open-vocabulary
detection, promptable segmentation, text-conditioned inpainting, and
vision-language description into a single workflow. The system works end to end
from a single prompt, retains intermediate artifacts for transparent debugging
(such as detections, masks, overlays, edited images, and before and after
composites), and provides the same functionality through an interactive UI and
a scriptable CLI for consistent, repeatable runs. We highlight integration
choices that reduce brittleness, including threshold adjustments, mask
inspection with light morphology, and resource-aware defaults. In a small,
single-word prompt segment, detection and segmentation produced usable masks in
over 90% of cases with an accuracy above 85% based on our criteria. On a
high-end GPU, inpainting makes up 60 to 75% of total runtime under typical
guidance and sampling settings, which highlights the need for careful tuning.
The study offers implementation-guided advice on thresholds, mask tightness,
and diffusion parameters, and details version pinning, artifact logging, and
seed control to support replay. Our contribution is a transparent, reliable
pattern for assembling modern vision and multimodal models behind a single
prompt, with clear guardrails and operational practices that improve
reliability in object replacement, scene augmentation, and removal.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 海底物体检测对海洋科研、潜水机器人和海洋保护至关重要，但现有方法无法完全处理海底环境的复杂性。需要系统性分析挑战并探索更有效的解决方案。

Method: 将海底物体检测挑战系统分类为五大类：图像质量逆逆、目标相关问题、数据挑战、计算处理限制和检测方法限制。分析了从传统到现代方法的进化，并通过案例研究探索大型视觉-语言模型的应用，包括使用DALL-E 3生成合成数据集和微调Florence-2模型。

Result: 识别了三个关键发现：(i)现有海底检测方法在处理图像逆逆和小物体检测方面仍不充分；(ii)LVLMs生成的合成数据具有增强数据集的潜力，但需更好的真实性；(iii)LVLMs在海底检测中展示了广阔前景，但实时应用仍需深入研究。

Conclusion: 大型视觉-语言模型为海底物体检测带来了新的机遇，特别是在多模态数据处理和合成数据生成方面。但需要进一步研究优化技术以实现实时应用，并提高合成数据的真实性和适用性。

Abstract: Underwater object detection (UOD) is vital to diverse marine applications,
including oceanographic research, underwater robotics, and marine conservation.
However, UOD faces numerous challenges that compromise its performance. Over
the years, various methods have been proposed to address these issues, but they
often fail to fully capture the complexities of underwater environments. This
review systematically categorizes UOD challenges into five key areas: Image
quality degradation, target-related issues, data-related challenges,
computational and processing constraints, and limitations in detection
methodologies. To address these challenges, we analyze the progression from
traditional image processing and object detection techniques to modern
approaches. Additionally, we explore the potential of large vision-language
models (LVLMs) in UOD, leveraging their multi-modal capabilities demonstrated
in other domains. We also present case studies, including synthetic dataset
generation using DALL-E 3 and fine-tuning Florence-2 LVLM for UOD. This review
identifies three key insights: (i) Current UOD methods are insufficient to
fully address challenges like image degradation and small object detection in
dynamic underwater environments. (ii) Synthetic data generation using LVLMs
shows potential for augmenting datasets but requires further refinement to
ensure realism and applicability. (iii) LVLMs hold significant promise for UOD,
but their real-time application remains under-explored, requiring further
research on optimization techniques.

Method: 基于感知拉直启发的自监督适应方法，使用具有归纳偏置潜在空间的自动编码器，在冻结图像特征序列中注入时间敏感性。

Conclusion: 提出的时间敏感视频表示方法能有效区分时间相反动作，提供紧凑而高性能的视频表示，为视频理解任务提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Our objective is to develop compact video representations that are sensitive
to visual change over time. To measure such time-sensitivity, we introduce a
new task: chiral action recognition, where one needs to distinguish between a
pair of temporally opposite actions, such as "opening vs. closing a door",
"approaching vs. moving away from something", "folding vs. unfolding paper",
etc. Such actions (i) occur frequently in everyday life, (ii) require
understanding of simple visual change over time (in object state, size, spatial
position, count . . . ), and (iii) are known to be poorly represented by many
video embeddings. Our goal is to build time aware video representations which
offer linear separability between these chiral pairs. To that end, we propose a
self-supervised adaptation recipe to inject time-sensitivity into a sequence of
frozen image features. Our model is based on an auto-encoder with a latent
space with inductive bias inspired by perceptual straightening. We show that
this results in a compact but time-sensitive video representation for the
proposed task across three datasets: Something-Something, EPIC-Kitchens, and
Charade. Our method (i) outperforms much larger video models pre-trained on
large-scale video datasets, and (ii) leads to an improvement in classification
performance on standard benchmarks when combined with these existing models.

Motivation: 现有的人类中心视频生成方法在处理文本、图像和音频等多模态输入时面临两个主要挑战：配对三元组训练数据稀缺，以及难以协调主体保持和音视频同步这两个子任务。

Method: 1) 构建高质量的多模态配对数据集；2) 采用两阶段渐进式训练范式：第一阶段使用最小侵入式图像注入策略保持主体，第二阶段通过焦点预测策略实现音视频同步；3) 推理时使用时间自适应分类器自由引导策略进行精细控制。

Result: 实验结果表明，HuMo在主体保持和音视频同步等子任务上超越了专门的先进方法，建立了统一的多模态条件人类视频生成框架。

Conclusion: HuMo通过创新的数据集构建、训练策略和推理方法，成功解决了多模态人类视频生成的协调问题，为协作式多模态控制提供了有效的统一框架。

Abstract: Human-Centric Video Generation (HCVG) methods seek to synthesize human videos
from multimodal inputs, including text, image, and audio. Existing methods
struggle to effectively coordinate these heterogeneous modalities due to two
challenges: the scarcity of training data with paired triplet conditions and
the difficulty of collaborating the sub-tasks of subject preservation and
audio-visual sync with multimodal inputs. In this work, we present HuMo, a
unified HCVG framework for collaborative multimodal control. For the first
challenge, we construct a high-quality dataset with diverse and paired text,
reference images, and audio. For the second challenge, we propose a two-stage
progressive multimodal training paradigm with task-specific strategies. For the
subject preservation task, to maintain the prompt following and visual
generation abilities of the foundation model, we adopt the minimal-invasive
image injection strategy. For the audio-visual sync task, besides the commonly
adopted audio cross-attention layer, we propose a focus-by-predicting strategy
that implicitly guides the model to associate audio with facial regions. For
joint learning of controllabilities across multimodal inputs, building on
previously acquired capabilities, we progressively incorporate the audio-visual
sync task. During inference, for flexible and fine-grained multimodal control,
we design a time-adaptive Classifier-Free Guidance strategy that dynamically
adjusts guidance weights across denoising steps. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate that HuMo surpasses specialized state-of-the-art methods in
sub-tasks, establishing a unified framework for collaborative
multimodal-conditioned HCVG. Project Page:

Method: 使用问答框架(二元和多项选择)，包含目标和陷阱实例，采用自下而上方法评估基础对象、粗到细的主体特征以及主体-动作对

Result: LVMs在识别基础对象和特征方面表现优异，但在处理精细细节或对齐涉及多个主体的多个动作时，幻觉敏感性显著增加

Conclusion: MESH提供了有效且全面的视频幻觉识别方法，揭示了LVMs在复杂视频理解任务中的局限性

Abstract: Large Video Models (LVMs) build on the semantic capabilities of Large
Language Models (LLMs) and vision modules by integrating temporal information
to better understand dynamic video content. Despite their progress, LVMs are
prone to hallucinations-producing inaccurate or irrelevant descriptions.
Current benchmarks for video hallucination depend heavily on manual
categorization of video content, neglecting the perception-based processes
through which humans naturally interpret videos. We introduce MESH, a benchmark
designed to evaluate hallucinations in LVMs systematically. MESH uses a
Question-Answering framework with binary and multi-choice formats incorporating
target and trap instances. It follows a bottom-up approach, evaluating basic
objects, coarse-to-fine subject features, and subject-action pairs, aligning
with human video understanding. We demonstrate that MESH offers an effective
and comprehensive approach for identifying hallucinations in videos. Our
evaluations show that while LVMs excel at recognizing basic objects and
features, their susceptibility to hallucinations increases markedly when
handling fine details or aligning multiple actions involving various subjects
in longer videos.

Motivation: 传统的单视角分类或回归模型无法充分捕捉植物表型特征的所有信息，影响植物健康评估和收获成熟度预测的准确性。多视角数据集存在显著重叠和冗余信息，需要开发能够学习视角不变嵌入的方法。

Method: 提出ViewSparsifier方法，采用随机视角选择策略，使用24个视角作为选择向量进行学习。还尝试了在所有5个高度级别（共120个视角）进行随机化视角选择的选择矩阵方法。

Result: ViewSparsifier方法在ACM Multimedia 2025 Growth Modelling挑战赛的植物年龄预测和叶片计数估计两个任务中均获得第一名。

Conclusion: 多视角学习和随机视角选择是有效的植物表型分析方法，选择矩阵方法为未来研究提供了进一步改进的方向。

Abstract: Plant phenotyping involves analyzing observable characteristics of plants to
better understand their growth, health, and development. In the context of deep
learning, this analysis is often approached through single-view classification
or regression models. However, these methods often fail to capture all
information required for accurate estimation of target phenotypic traits, which
can adversely affect plant health assessment and harvest readiness prediction.
To address this, the Growth Modelling (GroMo) Grand Challenge at ACM Multimedia
2025 provides a multi-view dataset featuring multiple plants and two tasks:
Plant Age Prediction and Leaf Count Estimation. Each plant is photographed from
multiple heights and angles, leading to significant overlap and redundancy in
the captured information. To learn view-invariant embeddings, we incorporate 24
views, referred to as the selection vector, in a random selection. Our
ViewSparsifier approach won both tasks. For further improvement and as a
direction for future research, we also experimented with randomized view
selection across all five height levels (120 views total), referred to as
selection matrices.

Motivation: 多模态模型在自然图像分割中表现优异，但在医学领域表现不佳，主要原因是文本提示与医学视觉特征之间的语义鸿沟以及由此产生的特征分散问题

Conclusion: 通过语义聚合视角重新审视医学图像分割问题，提出的两种机制协同作用显著提升了模型在医学领域的泛化性能

Abstract: Multimodal models have achieved remarkable success in natural image
segmentation, yet they often underperform when applied to the medical domain.
Through extensive study, we attribute this performance gap to the challenges of
multimodal fusion, primarily the significant semantic gap between abstract
textual prompts and fine-grained medical visual features, as well as the
resulting feature dispersion. To address these issues, we revisit the problem
from the perspective of semantic aggregation. Specifically, we propose an
Expectation-Maximization (EM) Aggregation mechanism and a Text-Guided Pixel
Decoder. The former mitigates feature dispersion by dynamically clustering
features into compact semantic centers to enhance cross-modal correspondence.
The latter is designed to bridge the semantic gap by leveraging
domain-invariant textual knowledge to effectively guide deep visual
representations. The synergy between these two mechanisms significantly
improves the model's generalization ability. Extensive experiments on public
cardiac and fundus datasets demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms existing SOTA approaches across multiple domain generalization
benchmarks.

Conclusion: GraphTopoNet展示了图机器学习如何将稀疏、不确定的地理物理观测转化为大陆尺度的可操作知识，提高了操作建模的可靠性，支持气候预测和政策制定

Abstract: Accurate maps of Greenland's subglacial bed are essential for sea-level
projections, but radar observations are sparse and uneven. We introduce
GraphTopoNet, a graph-learning framework that fuses heterogeneous supervision
and explicitly models uncertainty via Monte Carlo dropout. Spatial graphs built
from surface observables (elevation, velocity, mass balance) are augmented with
gradient features and polynomial trends to capture both local variability and
broad structure. To handle data gaps, we employ a hybrid loss that combines
confidence-weighted radar supervision with dynamically balanced regularization.
Applied to three Greenland subregions, GraphTopoNet outperforms interpolation,
convolutional, and graph-based baselines, reducing error by up to 60 percent
while preserving fine-scale glacial features. The resulting bed maps improve
reliability for operational modeling, supporting agencies engaged in climate
forecasting and policy. More broadly, GraphTopoNet shows how graph machine
learning can convert sparse, uncertain geophysical observations into actionable
knowledge at continental scale.

Abstract: The objective of this paper is to significantly reduce the manual workload
required from medical professionals in complex 3D segmentation tasks that
cannot be yet fully automated. For instance, in radiotherapy planning, organs
at risk must be accurately identified in computed tomography (CT) or magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) scans to ensure they are spared from harmful radiation.
Similarly, diagnosing age-related degenerative diseases such as sarcopenia,
which involve progressive muscle volume loss and strength, is commonly based on
muscular mass measurements often obtained from manual segmentation of medical
volumes. To alleviate the manual-segmentation burden, this paper introduces an
implicit shape prior to segment volumes from sparse slice manual annotations
generalized to the multi-organ case, along with a simple framework for
automatically selecting the most informative slices to guide and minimize the
next interactions. The experimental validation shows the method's effectiveness
on two medical use cases: assisted segmentation in the context of at risks
organs for brain cancer patients, and acceleration of the creation of a new
database with unseen muscle shapes for patients with sarcopenia.

Abstract: With imaging devices delivering ever-higher resolutions and the emerging
diffusion-based forgery methods, current detectors trained only on traditional
datasets (with splicing, copy-moving and object removal forgeries) lack
exposure to this new manipulation type. To address this, we propose a novel
high-resolution SIF dataset of 1200+ diffusion-generated manipulations with
semantically extracted masks. However, this also imposes a challenge on
existing methods, as they face significant computational resource constraints
due to their prohibitive computational complexities. Therefore, we propose a
novel EfficientIML model with a lightweight, three-stage EfficientRWKV
backbone. EfficientRWKV's hybrid state-space and attention network captures
global context and local details in parallel, while a multi-scale supervision
strategy enforces consistency across hierarchical predictions. Extensive
evaluations on our dataset and standard benchmarks demonstrate that our
approach outperforms ViT-based and other SOTA lightweight baselines in
localization performance, FLOPs and inference speed, underscoring its
suitability for real-time forensic applications.

Abstract: Recent advancements in foundation models, such as the Segment Anything Model
(SAM), have significantly impacted medical image segmentation, especially in
retinal imaging, where precise segmentation is vital for diagnosis. Despite
this progress, current methods face critical challenges: 1) modality ambiguity
in textual disease descriptions, 2) a continued reliance on manual prompting
for SAM-based workflows, and 3) a lack of a unified framework, with most
methods being modality- and task-specific. To overcome these hurdles, we
propose CLIP-unified Auto-Prompt Segmentation (\CLAPS), a novel method for
unified segmentation across diverse tasks and modalities in retinal imaging.
Our approach begins by pre-training a CLIP-based image encoder on a large,
multi-modal retinal dataset to handle data scarcity and distribution imbalance.
We then leverage GroundingDINO to automatically generate spatial bounding box
prompts by detecting local lesions. To unify tasks and resolve ambiguity, we
use text prompts enhanced with a unique "modality signature" for each imaging
modality. Ultimately, these automated textual and spatial prompts guide SAM to
execute precise segmentation, creating a fully automated and unified pipeline.
Extensive experiments on 12 diverse datasets across 11 critical segmentation
categories show that CLAPS achieves performance on par with specialized expert
models while surpassing existing benchmarks across most metrics, demonstrating
its broad generalizability as a foundation model.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have taken a great step towards AGI. Meanwhile,
an increasing number of domain-specific problems such as math and programming
boost these general-purpose models to continuously evolve via learning deeper
expertise. Now is thus the time further to extend the diversity of specialized
applications for knowledgeable LLMs, though collecting high quality data with
unexpected and informative tasks is challenging. In this paper, we propose to
use advertisement (ad) videos as a challenging test-bed to probe the ability of
LLMs in perceiving beyond the objective physical content of common visual
domain. Our motivation is to take full advantage of the clue-rich and
information-dense ad videos' traits, e.g., marketing logic, persuasive
strategies, and audience engagement. Our contribution is three-fold: (1) To our
knowledge, this is the first attempt to use ad videos with well-designed tasks
to evaluate LLMs. We contribute AdsQA, a challenging ad Video QA benchmark
derived from 1,544 ad videos with 10,962 clips, totaling 22.7 hours, providing
5 challenging tasks. (2) We propose ReAd-R, a Deepseek-R1 styled RL model that
reflects on questions, and generates answers via reward-driven optimization.
(3) We benchmark 14 top-tier LLMs on AdsQA, and our \texttt{ReAd-R}~achieves
the state-of-the-art outperforming strong competitors equipped with long-chain
reasoning capabilities by a clear margin.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Significant advancements in AI-driven multimodal medical image diagnosis have
led to substantial improvements in ophthalmic disease identification in recent
years. However, acquiring paired multimodal ophthalmic images remains
prohibitively expensive. While fundus photography is simple and cost-effective,
the limited availability of OCT data and inherent modality imbalance hinder
further progress. Conventional approaches that rely solely on fundus or textual
features often fail to capture fine-grained spatial information, as each
imaging modality provides distinct cues about lesion predilection sites. In
this study, we propose a novel unpaired multimodal framework \UOPSL that
utilizes extensive OCT-derived spatial priors to dynamically identify
predilection sites, enhancing fundus image-based disease recognition. Our
approach bridges unpaired fundus and OCTs via extended disease text
descriptions. Initially, we employ contrastive learning on a large corpus of
unpaired OCT and fundus images while simultaneously learning the predilection
sites matrix in the OCT latent space. Through extensive optimization, this
matrix captures lesion localization patterns within the OCT feature space.
During the fine-tuning or inference phase of the downstream classification task
based solely on fundus images, where paired OCT data is unavailable, we
eliminate OCT input and utilize the predilection sites matrix to assist in
fundus image classification learning. Extensive experiments conducted on 9
diverse datasets across 28 critical categories demonstrate that our framework
outperforms existing benchmarks.

TL;DR: LADB是一种半监督的样本到样本转换框架，利用部分配对数据在共享潜在空间中对齐源域和目标域分布，无需完全监督即可实现确定性域映射。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决扩散模型在数据稀缺领域面临的挑战，避免需要完全重新训练或昂贵配对数据的需求，在保真度和多样性之间取得平衡。

Method: 通过在共享潜在空间中对齐源域和目标域分布，将预训练的源域扩散模型与目标域潜在对齐扩散模型（LADM）集成，利用部分配对的潜在表示进行训练。

Result: 在部分监督下的深度到图像转换任务中表现出优越性能，并能扩展到多源转换（从深度图和分割掩码）和多目标转换的类条件风格迁移任务。

Conclusion: LADB为现实世界域转换提供了一个可扩展且通用的解决方案，特别适用于数据标注成本高或不完整的场景。

Abstract: Diffusion models excel at generating high-quality outputs but face challenges
in data-scarce domains, where exhaustive retraining or costly paired data are
often required. To address these limitations, we propose Latent Aligned
Diffusion Bridges (LADB), a semi-supervised framework for sample-to-sample
translation that effectively bridges domain gaps using partially paired data.
By aligning source and target distributions within a shared latent space, LADB
seamlessly integrates pretrained source-domain diffusion models with a
target-domain Latent Aligned Diffusion Model (LADM), trained on partially
paired latent representations. This approach enables deterministic domain
mapping without the need for full supervision. Compared to unpaired methods,
which often lack controllability, and fully paired approaches that require
large, domain-specific datasets, LADB strikes a balance between fidelity and
diversity by leveraging a mixture of paired and unpaired latent-target
couplings. Our experimental results demonstrate superior performance in
depth-to-image translation under partial supervision. Furthermore, we extend
LADB to handle multi-source translation (from depth maps and segmentation
masks) and multi-target translation in a class-conditioned style transfer task,
showcasing its versatility in handling diverse and heterogeneous use cases.
Ultimately, we present LADB as a scalable and versatile solution for real-world
domain translation, particularly in scenarios where data annotation is costly
or incomplete.

Conclusion: 双参考系双流架构能有效解耦手势形态和轨迹信息，为解决手语识别中的几何模糊性问题提供了有效方案

Abstract: Isolated Sign Language Recognition (ISLR) is challenged by gestures that are
morphologically similar yet semantically distinct, a problem rooted in the
complex interplay between hand shape and motion trajectory. Existing methods,
often relying on a single reference frame, struggle to resolve this geometric
ambiguity. This paper introduces Dual-SignLanguageNet (DSLNet), a
dual-reference, dual-stream architecture that decouples and models gesture
morphology and trajectory in separate, complementary coordinate systems. Our
approach utilizes a wrist-centric frame for view-invariant shape analysis and a
facial-centric frame for context-aware trajectory modeling. These streams are
processed by specialized networks-a topology-aware graph convolution for shape
and a Finsler geometry-based encoder for trajectory-and are integrated via a
geometry-driven optimal transport fusion mechanism. DSLNet sets a new
state-of-the-art, achieving 93.70%, 89.97% and 99.79% accuracy on the
challenging WLASL-100, WLASL-300 and LSA64 datasets, respectively, with
significantly fewer parameters than competing models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统光流估计方法需要大量标注数据，而真实标注难以获取。本文旨在开发一个无需真实标注的无监督框架，利用分形几何和自相似性原理来捕捉精细细节和长距离运动模式。

Method: 采用分形变形网络(FDN)架构，通过递归编码器-解码器嵌套和跳跃连接来捕获多尺度特征。训练目标基于变分公式，结合L1/L2数据保真度项和总变差(TV)正则化项来保证亮度恒定性和空间平滑性。

Result: 在合成和基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法能够产生准确、平滑且边缘保持的光流场，特别适用于高分辨率数据和标注有限的情况。

Conclusion: FractalPINN-Flow成功证明了无监督学习在光流估计中的有效性，分形几何启发的网络架构能够有效处理多尺度运动模式，为缺乏标注数据的实际应用提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: We present FractalPINN-Flow, an unsupervised deep learning framework for
dense optical flow estimation that learns directly from consecutive grayscale
frames without requiring ground truth. The architecture centers on the Fractal
Deformation Network (FDN) - a recursive encoder-decoder inspired by fractal
geometry and self-similarity. Unlike traditional CNNs with sequential
downsampling, FDN uses repeated encoder-decoder nesting with skip connections
to capture both fine-grained details and long-range motion patterns. The
training objective is based on a classical variational formulation using total
variation (TV) regularization. Specifically, we minimize an energy functional
that combines $L^1$ and $L^2$ data fidelity terms to enforce brightness
constancy, along with a TV term that promotes spatial smoothness and coherent
flow fields. Experiments on synthetic and benchmark datasets show that
FractalPINN-Flow produces accurate, smooth, and edge-preserving optical flow
fields. The model is especially effective for high-resolution data and
scenarios with limited annotations.

Traditional RGB-based approaches often suffer from training instability and
poor generalization in diverse maritime environments. This paper introduces a

control. Through comprehensive ablation studies, we demonstrate that HSV
supervision provides the highest impact (0.85 influence score), while the
complete framework achieves superior training stability (84\% variance
reduction) and enhanced segmentation quality. Our method shows consistent
improvements across multiple evaluation metrics while maintaining computational

applications. Conventional imaging methods often fail to deliver high-fidelity

analyzing the relationships between CI methods and their practical
contributions to CV applications, this work highlights emerging opportunities,
challenges, and future research directions. We emphasize the potential for

Abstract: As multimodal large language models (MLLMs) advance, their large-scale
architectures pose challenges for deployment in resource-constrained
environments. In the age of large models, where energy efficiency,
computational scalability and environmental sustainability are paramount, the
development of lightweight and high-performance models is critical for
real-world applications. As such, we propose a lightweight MLLM framework for
end-to-end visual question answering. Our proposed approach centres on
BreezeCLIP, a compact yet powerful vision-language encoder optimised for
efficient multimodal understanding. With only 1.2 billion parameters overall,
our model significantly reduces computational cost while achieving performance
comparable to standard-size MLLMs. Experiments conducted on multiple datasets
further validate its effectiveness in balancing accuracy and efficiency. The
modular and extensible design enables generalisation to broader multimodal
tasks. The proposed lightweight vision-language framework is denoted as BcQLM
(BreezeCLIP-enhanced Q-Gated Multimodal Language Model). It offers a promising
path toward deployable MLLMs under practical hardware constraints. The source

Conclusion: CQ方法是首个有效桥接2D和3D拥挤环境检测的方法，具有通用性和可推广性，无需额外数据即可应用于2D和3D检测

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel method for end-to-end crowd detection that
leverages object density information to enhance existing transformer-based
detectors. We present CrowdQuery (CQ), whose core component is our CQ module
that predicts and subsequently embeds an object density map. The embedded
density information is then systematically integrated into the decoder.
Existing density map definitions typically depend on head positions or
object-based spatial statistics. Our method extends these definitions to
include individual bounding box dimensions. By incorporating density
information into object queries, our method utilizes density-guided queries to
improve detection in crowded scenes. CQ is universally applicable to both 2D
and 3D detection without requiring additional data. Consequently, we are the
first to design a method that effectively bridges 2D and 3D detection in
crowded environments. We demonstrate the integration of CQ into both a general
2D and 3D transformer-based object detector, introducing the architectures CQ2D
and CQ3D. CQ is not limited to the specific transformer models we selected.
Experiments on the STCrowd dataset for both 2D and 3D domains show significant
performance improvements compared to the base models, outperforming most
state-of-the-art methods. When integrated into a state-of-the-art crowd
detector, CQ can further improve performance on the challenging CrowdHuman
dataset, demonstrating its generalizability. The code is released at

Motivation: 现有公开数据集缺乏地图先验、当前地图和传感器数据的三元组，导致方法必须依赖合成先验，造成不一致性和显著的sim2real差距。

Method: 采用双射映射框架，将大规模地图修改分解为地图元素级别的细粒度原子变化，确保可解释性，实现精确的变化检测和集成。

Conclusion: ArgoTweak为可解释的先验辅助高精地图建立了基准，推动了可扩展、自改进的地图解决方案发展。

Abstract: Reliable integration of prior information is crucial for self-verifying and
self-updating HD maps. However, no public dataset includes the required triplet
of prior maps, current maps, and sensor data. As a result, existing methods
must rely on synthetic priors, which create inconsistencies and lead to a
significant sim2real gap. To address this, we introduce ArgoTweak, the first
dataset to complete the triplet with realistic map priors. At its core,
ArgoTweak employs a bijective mapping framework, breaking down large-scale
modifications into fine-grained atomic changes at the map element level, thus
ensuring interpretability. This paradigm shift enables accurate change
detection and integration while preserving unchanged elements with high
fidelity. Experiments show that training models on ArgoTweak significantly
reduces the sim2real gap compared to synthetic priors. Extensive ablations
further highlight the impact of structured priors and detailed change
annotations. By establishing a benchmark for explainable, prior-aided HD
mapping, ArgoTweak advances scalable, self-improving mapping solutions. The
dataset, baselines, map modification toolbox, and further resources are

Conclusion: 多模态特定的策略对于评判模型校准至关重要，MMB为可靠的大规模文本到图像评估提供了有前景的路径

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are increasingly used to evaluate
text-to-image (TTI) generation systems, providing automated judgments based on
visual and textual context. However, these "judge" models often suffer from
biases, overconfidence, and inconsistent performance across diverse image
domains. While prompt ensembling has shown promise for mitigating these issues
in unimodal, text-only settings, our experiments reveal that standard
ensembling methods fail to generalize effectively for TTI tasks. To address
these limitations, we propose a new multimodal-aware method called Multimodal
Mixture-of-Bayesian Prompt Ensembles (MMB). Our method uses a Bayesian prompt
ensemble approach augmented by image clustering, allowing the judge to
dynamically assign prompt weights based on the visual characteristics of each
sample. We show that MMB improves accuracy in pairwise preference judgments and
greatly enhances calibration, making it easier to gauge the judge's true
uncertainty. In evaluations on two TTI benchmarks, HPSv2 and MJBench, MMB
outperforms existing baselines in alignment with human annotations and
calibration across varied image content. Our findings highlight the importance
of multimodal-specific strategies for judge calibration and suggest a promising
path forward for reliable large-scale TTI evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 碳中毒症在南亚和东南亚地区是严重公共卫生问题，早期皮肤表现容易误诊，特别是在农村地区缺乏皮肤科医生。需要自动化图像诊断方案支持早期发现

Method: 构建包含20类超11000张图像的数据集，对比CNN和Transformer模型性能，集成LIME和Grad-CAM可解释性技术，开发网页基础诊断工具

Result: Transformer模型显著超过CNN，Swin Transformer达到86%准确率，可解释性技术确认模型关注病变区域，外部验证表现良好

Conclusion: 该框架证明深度学习可以实现无侵入、易获取和可解释的碳中毒症诊断，特别适用于资源有限地区的早期精彩诊断

Abstract: Background: Arsenicosis is a serious public health concern in South and
Southeast Asia, primarily caused by long-term consumption of
arsenic-contaminated water. Its early cutaneous manifestations are clinically
significant but often underdiagnosed, particularly in rural areas with limited
access to dermatologists. Automated, image-based diagnostic solutions can
support early detection and timely interventions.
  Methods: In this study, we propose an end-to-end framework for arsenicosis
diagnosis using mobile phone-captured skin images. A dataset comprising 20
classes and over 11000 images of arsenic-induced and other dermatological
conditions was curated. Multiple deep learning architectures, including
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformer-based models, were
benchmarked for arsenicosis detection. Model interpretability was integrated
via LIME and Grad-CAM, while deployment feasibility was demonstrated through a
web-based diagnostic tool.
  Results: Transformer-based models significantly outperformed CNNs, with the
Swin Transformer achieving the best results (86\\% accuracy). LIME and Grad-CAM
visualizations confirmed that the models attended to lesion-relevant regions,
increasing clinical transparency and aiding in error analysis. The framework
also demonstrated strong performance on external validation samples, confirming
its ability to generalize beyond the curated dataset.
  Conclusion: The proposed framework demonstrates the potential of deep
learning for non-invasive, accessible, and explainable diagnosis of arsenicosis
from mobile-acquired images. By enabling reliable image-based screening, it can
serve as a practical diagnostic aid in rural and resource-limited communities,
where access to dermatologists is scarce, thereby supporting early detection
and timely intervention.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 事件相机在星迹踪踪踪系统中的精度验证，利用地球自转作为真实值对比，达到了很高的测量精度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 之前的研究难以获得事件相机在星迹踪踪踪系统中的准确真实值，需要一种可靠的方法来验证其测量精度

Method: 将事件相机固定并通过地面望远镜指向夜空，使得相机在天球参考系中的唯一运动是由地球自转引起的，然后将输出与IERS测量的地球方位进行对比

Result: 事件相机系统能够达到均方根误差18.47秒和绝对误差78.84秒的高精度测量

Conclusion: 结合事件相机在动态范围、能耗、更新频率等方面的优势，这种精度水平表明事件相机在低成本、低延迟星迹踪踪踪应用中具有很大的应用潜力

Abstract: Event-based cameras (EBCs) are a promising new technology for star
tracking-based attitude determination, but prior studies have struggled to
determine accurate ground truth for real data. We analyze the accuracy of an
EBC star tracking system utilizing the Earth's motion as the ground truth for
comparison. The Earth rotates in a regular way with very small irregularities
which are measured to the level of milli-arcseconds. By keeping an event camera
static and pointing it through a ground-based telescope at the night sky, we
create a system where the only camera motion in the celestial reference frame
is that induced by the Earth's rotation. The resulting event stream is
processed to generate estimates of orientation which we compare to the
International Earth Rotation and Reference System (IERS) measured orientation
of the Earth. The event camera system is able to achieve a root mean squared
across error of 18.47 arcseconds and an about error of 78.84 arcseconds.
Combined with the other benefits of event cameras over framing sensors (reduced
computation due to sparser data streams, higher dynamic range, lower energy
consumption, faster update rates), this level of accuracy suggests the utility
of event cameras for low-cost and low-latency star tracking. We provide all
code and data used to generate our results:

### [56] [Handling Multiple Hypotheses in Coarse-to-Fine Dense Image Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08805)
*Matthieu Vilain,Rémi Giraud,Yannick Berthoumieu,Guillaume Bourmaud*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BEAMER提出了一种新的密集图像匹配方法，通过在每个尺度为每个源位置预测多个对应假设，而不是单一假设，显著提高了在深度不连续和强缩放情况下的匹配鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在每个尺度为每个源位置只产生单一对应假设，在深度不连续或目标图像是源图像的强缩放时，相邻源位置的对应关系可能分布广泛，单一假设容易导致错误匹配。

Method: 采用beam search策略在每个尺度传播多个假设，并将这些多假设集成到交叉注意力层中，构建BEAMER架构来学习和传播跨尺度的多假设。

Result: BEAMER比现有最先进方法显著更鲁棒，特别是在深度不连续和目标图像是源图像强缩放的情况下表现优异。

Conclusion: 预测和传播多个对应假设是提高密集图像匹配鲁棒性的有效策略，BEAMER架构为此提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Dense image matching aims to find a correspondent for every pixel of a source
image in a partially overlapping target image. State-of-the-art methods
typically rely on a coarse-to-fine mechanism where a single correspondent
hypothesis is produced per source location at each scale. In challenging cases
-- such as at depth discontinuities or when the target image is a strong
zoom-in of the source image -- the correspondents of neighboring source
locations are often widely spread and predicting a single correspondent
hypothesis per source location at each scale may lead to erroneous matches. In
this paper, we investigate the idea of predicting multiple correspondent
hypotheses per source location at each scale instead. We consider a beam search
strategy to propagat multiple hypotheses at each scale and propose integrating
these multiple hypotheses into cross-attention layers, resulting in a novel
dense matching architecture called BEAMER. BEAMER learns to preserve and
propagate multiple hypotheses across scales, making it significantly more
robust than state-of-the-art methods, especially at depth discontinuities or
when the target image is a strong zoom-in of the source image.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GeneVA是一个大规模视频生成伪影数据集，包含丰富的人工标注，专注于从自然文本提示生成的视频中的时空伪影问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的概率生成模型从静态图像合成扩展到文本驱动的视频生成，但其固有的随机性会导致不可预测的伪影（如不可能的物理现象和时间不一致性）。由于视频独特的时空复杂性，现有数据集主要关注生成图像，缺乏系统性的视频生成质量评估基准

Method: 构建GeneVA数据集，包含大规模的视频生成样本，并配备丰富的人工标注，专门针对从自然文本提示生成的视频中的时空伪影进行系统分类和标注

Result: GeneVA数据集填补了视频生成质量评估的空白，为系统化评估模型性能和改进生成视频质量提供了重要工具

Conclusion: GeneVA数据集能够支持和促进关键应用，如模型性能基准测试和生成视频质量改进，为解决视频生成中的时空伪影问题提供了系统化的评估基础

Abstract: Recent advances in probabilistic generative models have extended capabilities
from static image synthesis to text-driven video generation. However, the
inherent randomness of their generation process can lead to unpredictable
artifacts, such as impossible physics and temporal inconsistency. Progress in
addressing these challenges requires systematic benchmarks, yet existing
datasets primarily focus on generative images due to the unique spatio-temporal
complexities of videos. To bridge this gap, we introduce GeneVA, a large-scale
artifact dataset with rich human annotations that focuses on spatio-temporal
artifacts in videos generated from natural text prompts. We hope GeneVA can
enable and assist critical applications, such as benchmarking model performance
and improving generative video quality.

*Jie Wu,Yu Gao,Zilyu Ye,Ming Li,Liang Li,Hanzhong Guo,Jie Liu,Zeyue Xue,Xiaoxia Hou,Wei Liu,Yan Zeng,Weilin Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RewardDance是一个可扩展的视觉生成奖励建模框架，通过生成式奖励范式解决现有方法的局限性，支持模型规模扩展到260亿参数，并在文本到图像、文本到视频和图像到视频生成中显著超越最先进方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有奖励模型在视觉生成中存在根本性限制：CLIP-based方法受架构和输入模态约束，Bradley-Terry损失与视觉语言模型的下一个token预测机制不匹配，且RLHF优化过程存在奖励黑客问题。

Method: 提出RewardDance框架，将奖励分数重新定义为模型预测"yes"token的概率，表示生成图像在特定标准下优于参考图像。这种方法使奖励目标与VLM架构内在对齐，支持模型规模和上下文规模的双重扩展。

Result: RewardDance在文本到图像、文本到视频和图像到视频生成中显著超越最先进方法。大规模奖励模型在RL微调期间表现出并保持高奖励方差，证明其抗黑客攻击能力，并能产生多样化高质量输出。

Conclusion: RewardDance成功解决了奖励黑客和模式崩溃问题，为视觉生成奖励模型的规模化提供了有效解决方案，显著提升了生成模型的质量和多样性。

Abstract: Reward Models (RMs) are critical for improving generation models via
Reinforcement Learning (RL), yet the RM scaling paradigm in visual generation
remains largely unexplored. It primarily due to fundamental limitations in
existing approaches: CLIP-based RMs suffer from architectural and input
modality constraints, while prevalent Bradley-Terry losses are fundamentally
misaligned with the next-token prediction mechanism of Vision-Language Models
(VLMs), hindering effective scaling. More critically, the RLHF optimization
process is plagued by Reward Hacking issue, where models exploit flaws in the
reward signal without improving true quality. To address these challenges, we
introduce RewardDance, a scalable reward modeling framework that overcomes
these barriers through a novel generative reward paradigm. By reformulating the
reward score as the model's probability of predicting a "yes" token, indicating
that the generated image outperforms a reference image according to specific
criteria, RewardDance intrinsically aligns reward objectives with VLM
architectures. This alignment unlocks scaling across two dimensions: (1) Model
Scaling: Systematic scaling of RMs up to 26 billion parameters; (2) Context
Scaling: Integration of task-specific instructions, reference examples, and
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
RewardDance significantly surpasses state-of-the-art methods in text-to-image,
text-to-video, and image-to-video generation. Crucially, we resolve the
persistent challenge of "reward hacking": Our large-scale RMs exhibit and
maintain high reward variance during RL fine-tuning, proving their resistance
to hacking and ability to produce diverse, high-quality outputs. It greatly
relieves the mode collapse problem that plagues smaller models.

Motivation: 解决单目视频中深度模糊问题，实现高质量的3D动态场景重建和物理渲染

Method: 使用物理模拟和可微分渲染，引入两个新的正则化项来处理单目视频的深度模糊问题

Result: 3D重建误差降低了2.64倍，每场景平均运行时间30分钟，能够从单目视频中恢复出锐利的细节

Conclusion: 该方法在3D动态织物重建方面取得了显著改进，同时能够进行高质量的外观估计

Abstract: The reconstruction of three-dimensional dynamic scenes is a well-established
yet challenging task within the domain of computer vision. In this paper, we
propose a novel approach that combines the domains of 3D geometry
reconstruction and appearance estimation for physically based rendering and
present a system that is able to perform both tasks for fabrics, utilizing only
a single monocular RGB video sequence as input. In order to obtain realistic
and high-quality deformations and renderings, a physical simulation of the
cloth geometry and differentiable rendering are employed. In this paper, we
introduce two novel regularization terms for the 3D reconstruction task that
improve the plausibility of the reconstruction by addressing the depth
ambiguity problem in monocular video. In comparison with the most recent
methods in the field, we have reduced the error in the 3D reconstruction by a
factor of 2.64 while requiring a medium runtime of 30 min per scene.
Furthermore, the optimized motion achieves sufficient quality to perform an
appearance estimation of the deforming object, recovering sharp details from
this single monocular RGB video.

Abstract: PySensors is a Python package for selecting and placing a sparse set of
sensors for reconstruction and classification tasks. In this major update to
\texttt{PySensors}, we introduce spatially constrained sensor placement
capabilities, allowing users to enforce constraints such as maximum or exact
sensor counts in specific regions, incorporate predetermined sensor locations,
and maintain minimum distances between sensors. We extend functionality to
support custom basis inputs, enabling integration of any data-driven or
spectral basis. We also propose a thermodynamic approach that goes beyond a
single ``optimal'' sensor configuration and maps the complete landscape of
sensor interactions induced by the training data. This comprehensive view
facilitates integration with external selection criteria and enables assessment
of sensor replacement impacts. The new optimization technique also accounts for
over- and under-sampling of sensors, utilizing a regularized least squares
approach for robust reconstruction. Additionally, we incorporate noise-induced
uncertainty quantification of the estimation error and provide visual
uncertainty heat maps to guide deployment decisions. To highlight these
additions, we provide a brief description of the mathematical algorithms and
theory underlying these new capabilities. We demonstrate the usage of new
features with illustrative code examples and include practical advice for
implementation across various application domains. Finally, we outline a
roadmap of potential extensions to further enhance the package's functionality
and applicability to emerging sensing challenges.

Abstract: This letter introduces SVN-ICP, a novel Iterative Closest Point (ICP)
algorithm with uncertainty estimation that leverages Stein Variational Newton

consistent noise parameter inference, even in LiDAR-degraded environments. By
approximating the posterior distribution using particles within the Stein

Result: NetConEmb模型离线评估MedAE为0.58×10⁻³ rad/s，实时导航在已知和未知环境中均达到100%成功率；轻量级NetEmb参数减少25%，RMSE为21.68×10⁻³ rad/s

Conclusion: NetConEmb模型在避障任务中表现出色，特别是在未知环境中具有很好的鲁棒性，而轻量级模型在已知环境中也能取得可比较的结果

Abstract: Obstacle avoidance is a critical component of the navigation stack required
for mobile robots to operate effectively in complex and unknown environments.
In this research, three end-to-end Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) were
trained and evaluated offline and deployed on a differential-drive mobile robot
for real-time obstacle avoidance to generate low-level steering commands from
synchronized color and depth images acquired by an Intel RealSense D415 RGB-D
camera in diverse environments. Offline evaluation showed that the NetConEmb
model achieved the best performance with a notably low MedAE of $0.58 \times
10^{-3}$ rad/s. In comparison, the lighter NetEmb architecture adopted in this
study, which reduces the number of trainable parameters by approximately 25\%
and converges faster, produced comparable results with an RMSE of $21.68 \times
10^{-3}$ rad/s, close to the $21.42 \times 10^{-3}$ rad/s obtained by
NetConEmb. Real-time navigation further confirmed NetConEmb's robustness,
achieving a 100\% success rate in both known and unknown environments, while
NetEmb and NetGated succeeded only in navigating the known environment.

Abstract: This paper proposes a framework for multi-robot systems to perform

an unknown and potentially time-varying density function. To overcome the
limitations of Gaussian Process (GP) regression, we employ Random Feature GP
(RFGP) and its online variant (O-RFGP) that enables online and incremental
inference. By integrating these with Voronoi-based coverage control and Upper
Confidence Bound (UCB) sampling strategy, a team of robots can adaptively focus
on important regions while refining the learned spatial field for efficient
coverage. Under mild assumptions, we provide theoretical guarantees and
evaluate the framework through simulations in time-invariant scenarios.
Furthermore, its effectiveness in time-varying settings is demonstrated through

Motivation: 解决机器人通过自然语言抓取指定物体的挑战，现有方法难以处理开放形式的语言表达和重复物体场景，且依赖昂贵的像素级标注。

Method: 提出基于属性的物体定位和机器人抓取框架(OGRG)，包含双向视觉语言融合模块和深度信息集成，支持强监督(RGS)和弱监督(RGA)两种学习设置。

Result: 在桌面场景中优于所有基线方法，RGS设置下达到17.59 FPS，RGA设置在仿真和真实机器人试验中均超越基线抓取成功率。

Conclusion: OGRG框架通过空间推理设计有效提升了物体定位和抓取性能，支持闭环或多物体顺序抓取应用。

Abstract: Enabling robots to grasp objects specified through natural language is
essential for effective human-robot interaction, yet it remains a significant
challenge. Existing approaches often struggle with open-form language
expressions and typically assume unambiguous target objects without duplicates.
Moreover, they frequently rely on costly, dense pixel-wise annotations for both
object grounding and grasp configuration. We present Attribute-based Object
Grounding and Robotic Grasping (OGRG), a novel framework that interprets
open-form language expressions and performs spatial reasoning to ground target
objects and predict planar grasp poses, even in scenes containing duplicated
object instances. We investigate OGRG in two settings: (1) Referring Grasp
Synthesis (RGS) under pixel-wise full supervision, and (2) Referring Grasp
Affordance (RGA) using weakly supervised learning with only single-pixel grasp
annotations. Key contributions include a bi-directional vision-language fusion
module and the integration of depth information to enhance geometric reasoning,
improving both grounding and grasping performance. Experiment results show that
OGRG outperforms strong baselines in tabletop scenes with diverse spatial
language instructions. In RGS, it operates at 17.59 FPS on a single NVIDIA RTX
2080 Ti GPU, enabling potential use in closed-loop or multi-object sequential
grasping, while delivering superior grounding and grasp prediction accuracy
compared to all the baselines considered. Under the weakly supervised RGA
setting, OGRG also surpasses baseline grasp-success rates in both simulation
and real-robot trials, underscoring the effectiveness of its spatial reasoning
design. Project page: https://z.umn.edu/ogrg

Conclusion: IUPF框架有效解决了自动驾驶交互轨迹规划中的关键挑战，实现了安全、高效且可扩展的轨迹规划，支持保守、激进和合作等多种驾驶行为。

Abstract: Interactive trajectory planning in autonomous driving must balance safety,
efficiency, and scalability under heterogeneous driving behaviors. Existing
methods often face high computational cost or rely on external safety critics.
To address this, we propose an Interaction-Enriched Unified Potential Field
(IUPF) framework that fuses style-dependent benefit and risk fields through a
physics-inspired variational model, grounded in mean field game theory. The
approach captures conservative, aggressive, and cooperative behaviors without
additional safety modules, and employs stochastic differential equations to
guarantee Nash equilibrium with exponential convergence. Simulations on lane
changing and overtaking scenarios show that IUPF ensures safe distances,
generates smooth and efficient trajectories, and outperforms traditional
optimization and game-theoretic baselines in both adaptability and
computational efficiency.

*Viraj Parimi,Brian C. Williams*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了RB-CBS方法，通过动态分配风险预算来平衡多智能体导航的安全性和效率，解决了传统图剪枝方法过于保守的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统规划方法依赖预定义距离度量，而安全强化学习在多智能体目标条件场景中表现不佳。现有的图剪枝方法过于保守，限制了任务效率，特别是在需要穿越高风险区域的任务中。

Method: 提出了RB-CBS方法，这是冲突搜索(CBS)的新扩展，能够动态分配和调整用户指定的风险边界(Δ)给各个智能体，为每个智能体分配局部风险预算(δ)，在保持整体安全约束的同时实现更高效的导航。

Result: 实验结果表明，这种迭代风险分配框架在复杂环境中表现出优越性能，使多个智能体能够在用户指定的风险边界内找到无碰撞路径。

Conclusion: RB-CBS方法通过动态风险预算分配，有效解决了多智能体视觉导航中安全性与效率的权衡问题，为在危险环境中运行的自主系统提供了更灵活的路径规划解决方案。

Abstract: Safe navigation is essential for autonomous systems operating in hazardous
environments, especially when multiple agents must coordinate using just visual
inputs over extended time horizons. Traditional planning methods excel at
solving long-horizon tasks but rely on predefined distance metrics, while safe
Reinforcement Learning (RL) can learn complex behaviors using high-dimensional
inputs yet struggles with multi-agent, goal-conditioned scenarios. Recent work
combined these paradigms by leveraging goal-conditioned RL (GCRL) to build an
intermediate graph from replay buffer states, pruning unsafe edges, and using
Conflict-Based Search (CBS) for multi-agent path planning. Although effective,
this graph-pruning approach can be overly conservative, limiting mission
efficiency by precluding missions that must traverse high-risk regions. To
address this limitation, we propose RB-CBS, a novel extension to CBS that
dynamically allocates and adjusts user-specified risk bound ($\Delta$) across
agents to flexibly trade off safety and speed. Our improved planner ensures
that each agent receives a local risk budget ($\delta$) enabling more efficient
navigation while still respecting overall safety constraints. Experimental
results demonstrate that this iterative risk-allocation framework yields
superior performance in complex environments, allowing multiple agents to find
collision-free paths within the user-specified $\Delta$.

Conclusion: 提出的轻量级零样本重缩放方法能够有效从单目RGB和IMU数据获得度量深度，成功集成到运动基元规划器中实现实时碰撞避免

Abstract: This paper presents a methodology to predict metric depth from monocular RGB
images and an inertial measurement unit (IMU). To enable collision avoidance
during autonomous flight, prior works either leverage heavy sensors (e.g.,
LiDARs or stereo cameras) or data-intensive and domain-specific fine-tuning of
monocular metric depth estimation methods. In contrast, we propose several
lightweight zero-shot rescaling strategies to obtain metric depth from relative
depth estimates via the sparse 3D feature map created using a visual-inertial
navigation system. These strategies are compared for their accuracy in diverse
simulation environments. The best performing approach, which leverages
monotonic spline fitting, is deployed in the real-world on a
compute-constrained quadrotor. We obtain on-board metric depth estimates at 15
Hz and demonstrate successful collision avoidance after integrating the
proposed method with a motion primitives-based planner.

TL;DR: 通过结合双次氛散模型和MAPF结构化分解的方法，DG-MAP提高了多机械臂运动规划的可扩展性，减少对大规模多臂数据集的依赖


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多机械臂运动规划在共享空间中完成复杂长时间任务至关重要，但现有方法因状态空间指数增长和依赖大规模训练数据集而遇到可扩展性问题

Method: 训练两个条件双次氛散模型：一个生成可行单臂轨迹，另一个模型双臂动力学以处理对撞解决，并在MAPF结构化分解框架中集成这些专门化生成模型

Result: 在不同团队规模下与其他学习基方法进行比较评估，证明了该方法的有效性和实际应用性

Conclusion: 通过将专门化生成模型与MAPF受灵感的结构化分解相结合，DG-MAP能够高效地扩展到更多机械臂的规划问题，同时减少对大规模多臂数据集的依赖

Abstract: Multi-arm motion planning is fundamental for enabling arms to complete
complex long-horizon tasks in shared spaces efficiently but current methods
struggle with scalability due to exponential state-space growth and reliance on
large training datasets for learned models. Inspired by Multi-Agent Path
Finding (MAPF), which decomposes planning into single-agent problems coupled
with collision resolution, we propose a novel diffusion-guided multi-arm
planner (DG-MAP) that enhances scalability of learning-based models while
reducing their reliance on massive multi-arm datasets. Recognizing that
collisions are primarily pairwise, we train two conditional diffusion models,
one to generate feasible single-arm trajectories, and a second, to model the
dual-arm dynamics required for effective pairwise collision resolution. By
integrating these specialized generative models within a MAPF-inspired
structured decomposition, our planner efficiently scales to larger number of
arms. Evaluations against alternative learning-based methods across various
team sizes demonstrate our method's effectiveness and practical applicability.

Abstract: This paper presents a reinforcement learning-based quadrotor navigation
method that leverages efficient differentiable simulation, novel loss
functions, and privileged information to navigate around large obstacles. Prior
learning-based methods perform well in scenes that exhibit narrow obstacles,
but struggle when the goal location is blocked by large walls or terrain. In
contrast, the proposed method utilizes time-of-arrival (ToA) maps as privileged
information and a yaw alignment loss to guide the robot around large obstacles.
The policy is evaluated in photo-realistic simulation environments containing
large obstacles, sharp corners, and dead-ends. Our approach achieves an 86%
success rate and outperforms baseline strategies by 34%. We deploy the policy
onboard a custom quadrotor in outdoor cluttered environments both during the
day and night. The policy is validated across 20 flights, covering 589 meters
without collisions at speeds up to 4 m/s.

Motivation: 自动驾驶研究越来越多地采用深度强化学习，但缺乏对这些算法如何被使用、基准测试和评估的系统性分析。本文旨在填补这一空白，为研究社区提供统一的分类和量化统计。

Method: 通过系统分析约100篇同行评审论文，对文献进行分类（模型无关、模型相关、分层、混合方法），量化算法流行度，分析状态/动作/奖励设计，并整理评估指标和基准测试配置。

Result: 研究发现超过80%的研究仍依赖模型无关方法（如DQN、PPO、SAC）；总结了常用的传感器模态、控制抽象和奖励设计；整理了常见的评估指标和CARLA基准测试配置。

Conclusion: 指出了稀疏奖励、仿真到现实的迁移、安全保证和行为多样性有限等持续挑战，提出了模型相关RL、元学习和更丰富的多智能体模拟等有前景的方向，为RL-based自动驾驶研究提供了路线图。

Abstract: Autonomous-driving research has recently embraced deep Reinforcement Learning
(RL) as a promising framework for data-driven decision making, yet a clear
picture of how these algorithms are currently employed, benchmarked and
evaluated is still missing. This survey fills that gap by systematically
analysing around 100 peer-reviewed papers that train, test or validate RL
policies inside the open-source CARLA simulator. We first categorize the
literature by algorithmic family model-free, model-based, hierarchical, and
hybrid and quantify their prevalence, highlighting that more than 80% of
existing studies still rely on model-free methods such as DQN, PPO and SAC.
Next, we explain the diverse state, action and reward formulations adopted
across works, illustrating how choices of sensor modality (RGB, LiDAR, BEV,
semantic maps, and carla kinematics states), control abstraction (discrete vs.
continuous) and reward shaping are used across various literature. We also
consolidate the evaluation landscape by listing the most common metrics
(success rate, collision rate, lane deviation, driving score) and the towns,
scenarios and traffic configurations used in CARLA benchmarks. Persistent
challenges including sparse rewards, sim-to-real transfer, safety guarantees
and limited behaviour diversity are distilled into a set of open research
questions, and promising directions such as model-based RL, meta-learning and
richer multi-agent simulations are outlined. By providing a unified taxonomy,
quantitative statistics and a critical discussion of limitations, this review
aims to serve both as a reference for newcomers and as a roadmap for advancing
RL-based autonomous driving toward real-world deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 触摸丰富操作中需要力反馈进行数据采集，但双向遥播系统复杂难以实现，屏障了在低成本硬件上的应用

Method: 依靠简单反馈控制器的双向遥播方法，主从架构，无需力传感器，低成本硬件实现

Result: 方法参数调整最小化，实现高操作性和接触稳定性，超过传统方法，在低通信频率下仍保持良好性能，在两种商用低成本硬件上无需参数调整即可实现

Conclusion: 该方法将扩大力反馈遥播系统在低成本硬件上的应用，推进触摸丰富任务的仿照学习自主性

Abstract: Effective data collection in contact-rich manipulation requires force
feedback during teleoperation, as accurate perception of contact is crucial for
stable control. However, such technology remains uncommon, largely because
bilateral teleoperation systems are complex and difficult to implement. To
overcome this, we propose a bilateral teleoperation method that relies only on
a simple feedback controller and does not require force sensors. The approach
is designed for leader-follower setups using low-cost hardware, making it
broadly applicable. Through numerical simulations and real-world experiments,
we demonstrate that the method requires minimal parameter tuning, yet achieves
both high operability and contact stability, outperforming conventional
approaches. Furthermore, we show its high robustness: even at low communication
cycle rates between leader and follower, control performance degradation is
minimal compared to high-speed operation. We also prove our method can be
implemented on two types of commercially available low-cost hardware with zero
parameter adjustments. This highlights its high ease of implementation and
versatility. We expect this method will expand the use of force feedback
teleoperation systems on low-cost hardware. This will contribute to advancing
contact-rich task autonomy in imitation learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统事件视觉量程方法在低光高动态范围条件下性能不稳定，需要深度学习方法来解决这些挑战。

Method: 提出新的静态双目关联策略进行稀疏深度估计，结合紧耦合束优化和递归网络的光流估计能力。

Result: 系统能够实时处理VGA分辨率事件数据，在多个公开数据集上表现優称，特别是在大规模夜间HDR场景中保持稳定的位估计。

Conclusion: Stereo-DEVO系络显示了在极端条件下的稳健性和优秀性能，为事件基视觉量程方法的实际应用提供了有力支撑。

Abstract: Event-based cameras are bio-inspired sensors with pixels that independently
and asynchronously respond to brightness changes at microsecond resolution,
offering the potential to handle state estimation tasks involving motion blur
and high dynamic range (HDR) illumination conditions. However, the versatility
of event-based visual odometry (VO) relying on handcrafted data association
(either direct or indirect methods) is still unreliable, especially in field
robot applications under low-light HDR conditions, where the dynamic range can
be enormous and the signal-to-noise ratio is spatially-and-temporally varying.
Leveraging deep neural networks offers new possibilities for overcoming these
challenges. In this paper, we propose a learning-based stereo event visual
odometry. Building upon Deep Event Visual Odometry (DEVO), our system (called
Stereo-DEVO) introduces a novel and efficient static-stereo association
strategy for sparse depth estimation with almost no additional computational
burden. By integrating it into a tightly coupled bundle adjustment (BA)
optimization scheme, and benefiting from the recurrent network's ability to
perform accurate optical flow estimation through voxel-based event
representations to establish reliable patch associations, our system achieves
high-precision pose estimation in metric scale. In contrast to the offline
performance of DEVO, our system can process event data of \zs{Video Graphics
Array} (VGA) resolution in real time. Extensive evaluations on multiple public
real-world datasets and self-collected data justify our system's versatility,
demonstrating superior performance compared to state-of-the-art event-based VO
methods. More importantly, our system achieves stable pose estimation even in
large-scale nighttime HDR scenarios.

Conclusion: RKL方法具有高度样本效率、轻量级和快速特性，适用于资源受限的硬件学习场景，开源高性能C++代码库。

Abstract: Data-driven control methods need to be sample-efficient and lightweight,
especially when data acquisition and computational resources are limited --
such as during learning on hardware. Most modern data-driven methods require
large datasets and struggle with real-time updates of models, limiting their
performance in dynamic environments. Koopman theory formally represents
nonlinear systems as linear models over observables, and Koopman
representations can be determined from data in an optimization-friendly setting
with potentially rapid model updates. In this paper, we present a highly
sample-efficient, Koopman-based learning pipeline: Recursive Koopman Learning
(RKL). We identify sufficient conditions for model convergence and provide
formal algorithmic analysis supporting our claim that RKL is lightweight and
fast, with complexity independent of dataset size. We validate our method on a
simulated planar two-link arm and a hybrid nonlinear hardware system with soft
actuators, showing that real-time recursive Koopman model updates improve the
sample efficiency and stability of data-driven controller synthesis --
requiring only <10% of the data compared to benchmarks. The high-performance
C++ codebase is open-sourced. Website:

Conclusion: 行为异构的机器人团队在多智能体探索中具有显著优势，提出的分布式任务分配方法能够有效提高探索效率并降低通信需求

Abstract: We study a problem of multi-agent exploration with behaviorally heterogeneous
robots. Each robot maps its surroundings using SLAM and identifies a set of
areas of interest (AoIs) or frontiers that are the most informative to explore
next. The robots assess the utility of going to a frontier using Behavioral
Entropy (BE) and then determine which frontier to go to via a distributed task
assignment scheme. We convert the task assignment problem into a
non-cooperative game and use a distributed algorithm (d-PBRAG) to converge to
the Nash equilibrium (which we show is the optimal task allocation solution).
For unknown utility cases, we provide robust bounds using approximate rewards.
We test our algorithm (which has less communication cost and fast convergence)
in simulation, where we explore the effect of sensing radii, sensing accuracy,
and heterogeneity among robotic teams with respect to the time taken to
complete exploration and path traveled. We observe that having a team of agents
with heterogeneous behaviors is beneficial.

Abstract: In robotic systems, the performance of reinforcement learning depends on the
rationality of predefined reward functions. However, manually designed reward
functions often lead to policy failures due to inaccuracies. Inverse
Reinforcement Learning (IRL) addresses this problem by inferring implicit
reward functions from expert demonstrations. Nevertheless, existing methods
rely heavily on large amounts of expert demonstrations to accurately recover
the reward function. The high cost of collecting expert demonstrations in
robotic applications, particularly in multi-robot systems, severely hinders the
practical deployment of IRL. Consequently, improving sample efficiency has
emerged as a critical challenge in multi-agent inverse reinforcement learning
(MIRL). Inspired by the symmetry inherent in multi-agent systems, this work
theoretically demonstrates that leveraging symmetry enables the recovery of
more accurate reward functions. Building upon this insight, we propose a
universal framework that integrates symmetry into existing multi-agent
adversarial IRL algorithms, thereby significantly enhancing sample efficiency.
Experimental results from multiple challenging tasks have demonstrated the
effectiveness of this framework. Further validation in physical multi-robot
systems has shown the practicality of our method.

foundational aspects. We conclude by discussing key challenges, particularly
those associated with the integration of these capabilities into real-time,

Abstract: Tactile and kinesthetic perceptions are crucial for human dexterous
manipulation, enabling reliable grasping of objects via proprioceptive
sensorimotor integration. For robotic hands, even though acquiring such tactile
and kinesthetic feedback is feasible, establishing a direct mapping from this
sensory feedback to motor actions remains challenging. In this paper, we
propose a novel glove-mediated tactile-kinematic perception-prediction
framework for grasp skill transfer from human intuitive and natural operation
to robotic execution based on imitation learning, and its effectiveness is
validated through generalized grasping tasks, including those involving
deformable objects. Firstly, we integrate a data glove to capture tactile and
kinesthetic data at the joint level. The glove is adaptable for both human and
robotic hands, allowing data collection from natural human hand demonstrations
across different scenarios. It ensures consistency in the raw data format,
enabling evaluation of grasping for both human and robotic hands. Secondly, we
establish a unified representation of multi-modal inputs based on graph
structures with polar coordinates. We explicitly integrate the morphological
differences into the designed representation, enhancing the compatibility
across different demonstrators and robotic hands. Furthermore, we introduce the
Tactile-Kinesthetic Spatio-Temporal Graph Networks (TK-STGN), which leverage
multidimensional subgraph convolutions and attention-based LSTM layers to
extract spatio-temporal features from graph inputs to predict node-based states
for each hand joint. These predictions are then mapped to final commands
through a force-position hybrid mapping.

Abstract: Diffusion models offer powerful generative capabilities for robot trajectory
planning, yet their practical deployment on robots is hindered by a critical
bottleneck: a reliance on imitation learning from expert demonstrations. This
paradigm is often impractical for specialized robots where data is scarce and
creates an inefficient, theoretically suboptimal training pipeline. To overcome
this, we introduce PegasusFlow, a hierarchical rolling-denoising framework that
enables direct and parallel sampling of trajectory score gradients from
environmental interaction, completely bypassing the need for expert data. Our
core innovation is a novel sampling algorithm, Weighted Basis Function
Optimization (WBFO), which leverages spline basis representations to achieve
superior sample efficiency and faster convergence compared to traditional
methods like MPPI. The framework is embedded within a scalable, asynchronous
parallel simulation architecture that supports massively parallel rollouts for
efficient data collection. Extensive experiments on trajectory optimization and
robotic navigation tasks demonstrate that our approach, particularly
Action-Value WBFO (AVWBFO) combined with a reinforcement learning warm-start,
significantly outperforms baselines. In a challenging barrier-crossing task,
our method achieved a 100% success rate and was 18% faster than the next-best
method, validating its effectiveness for complex terrain locomotion planning.

Abstract: As robotics gains popularity, interaction control becomes crucial for
ensuring force tracking in manipulator-based tasks. Typically, traditional
interaction controllers either require extensive tuning, or demand expert
knowledge of the environment, which is often impractical in real-world
applications. This work proposes a novel control strategy leveraging Neural
Networks (NNs) to enhance the force-tracking behavior of a Direct Force
Controller (DFC). Unlike similar previous approaches, it accounts for the
manipulator's tangential velocity, a critical factor in force exertion,
especially during fast motions. The method employs an ensemble of feedforward
NNs to predict contact forces, then exploits the prediction to solve an
optimization problem and generate an optimal residual action, which is added to
the DFC output and applied to an impedance controller. The proposed
Velocity-augmented Artificial intelligence Interaction Controller for Ambiguous
Models (VAICAM) is validated in the Gazebo simulator on a Franka Emika Panda
robot. Against a vast set of trajectories, VAICAM achieves superior performance
compared to two baseline controllers.

Motivation: 传统固定编队的引导方法在城市和障碍物丰富的场景中往往无效或存在风险，特别是在面对具有未知和自适应行为的对抗性智能体时

Method: 基于可达-规避博弈理论和局部运动规划的层次混合框架，包含虚拟包容边界和事件触发的追踪机制

Conclusion: 该框架为复杂操作环境中对抗性智能体的安全引导提供了可扩展和鲁棒的多智能体协调解决方案

Abstract: Recent advances in robotics have enabled the widespread deployment of
autonomous robotic systems in complex operational environments, presenting both
unprecedented opportunities and significant security problems. Traditional
shepherding approaches based on fixed formations are often ineffective or risky
in urban and obstacle-rich scenarios, especially when facing adversarial agents
with unknown and adaptive behaviors. This paper addresses this challenge as an
extended herding problem, where defensive robotic systems must safely guide
adversarial agents with unknown strategies away from protected areas and into
predetermined safe regions, while maintaining collision-free navigation in
dynamic environments. We propose a hierarchical hybrid framework based on
reach-avoid game theory and local motion planning, incorporating a virtual
containment boundary and event-triggered pursuit mechanisms to enable scalable
and robust multi-agent coordination. Simulation results demonstrate that the
proposed approach achieves safe and efficient guidance of adversarial agents to
designated regions.

TL;DR: CLAP是一种基于聚类的定位方法，通过场对特征对估计机器人状态进行聚类，在RoboCup 2024人形足球机器人比赛中表现出优异的鲁棒性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在立体视觉和惯性传感器限制下，应对变化光照条件、动态特征遮挡、高冲击步进噪声以及误检特征等挑战，需要准确且鲁棒的定位算法来支持路径规划和比赛策略。

Method: CLAP通过聚类从场对特征对估计的机器人状态来实现全局定位，正确估计自然聚集而错误估计分散，结合粒子滤波和扩展卡尔曼滤波提高一致性和平滑性。

Result: 与其他地标定位方法相比精度相当，但在误检特征增加的情况下，CLAP在鲁棒性方面表现更优，发散和速度跳跃很少，比赛中的实际表现良好。

Conclusion: CLAP是一种有效的定位方法，特别适合在噪声和误检特征较多的环境中使用，为机器人足球比赛提供了可靠的定位基础。

Abstract: In this paper, we present our localization method called CLAP, Clustering to
Localize Across $n$ Possibilities, which helped us win the RoboCup 2024
adult-sized autonomous humanoid soccer competition. Competition rules limited
our sensor suite to stereo vision and an inertial sensor, similar to humans. In
addition, our robot had to deal with varying lighting conditions, dynamic
feature occlusions, noise from high-impact stepping, and mistaken features from
bystanders and neighboring fields. Therefore, we needed an accurate, and most
importantly robust localization algorithm that would be the foundation for our
path-planning and game-strategy algorithms. CLAP achieves these requirements by
clustering estimated states of our robot from pairs of field features to
localize its global position and orientation. Correct state estimates naturally
cluster together, while incorrect estimates spread apart, making CLAP resilient
to noise and incorrect inputs. CLAP is paired with a particle filter and an
extended Kalman filter to improve consistency and smoothness. Tests of CLAP
with other landmark-based localization methods showed similar accuracy.
However, tests with increased false positive feature detection showed that CLAP
outperformed other methods in terms of robustness with very little divergence
and velocity jumps. Our localization performed well in competition, allowing
our robot to shoot faraway goals and narrowly defend our goal.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 辅助机器人虽然有很大潜力帮助衰弱老年人，但实验室开发与实际应用之间存在差距，需要了解真实需求来弥合这一差距。

Method: 采用基于角色的共同设计方法，举办了7场研讨会，共有61名参与者，包括有衰弱生活经验的人、照顾者和医疗专业人员。

Result: 研究发现辅助解决方案必须在心理社会和环境因素复杂互动的背景下开发，提出了与衰弱直接相关的设计需求。

Conclusion: 研究结果可以帮助促进更务实的设计思维，使辅助机器人更接近实际应用，更好地满足人们的需求。

Abstract: While assistive robots have much potential to help older people with
frailty-related needs, there are few in use. There is a gap between what is
developed in laboratories and what would be viable in real-world contexts.
Through a series of co-design workshops (61 participants across 7 sessions)
including those with lived experience of frailty, their carers, and healthcare
professionals, we gained a deeper understanding of everyday issues concerning
the place of new technologies in their lives. A persona-based approach surfaced
emotional, social, and psychological issues. Any assistive solution must be
developed in the context of this complex interplay of psychosocial and
environmental factors. Our findings, presented as design requirements in direct
relation to frailty, can help promote design thinking that addresses people's
needs in a more pragmatic way to move assistive robotics closer to real-world
use.

*Soheil Espahbodini Nia*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: FMT^x是FMT*算法的扩展，通过在动态环境中实现高效重规划来解决机器人路径规划的核心挑战。它通过修改邻居选择规则和选择性更新机制，在保持渐进最优性和计算效率的同时，能够实时适应环境变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态环境中的路径规划是机器人技术的核心挑战，特别是在仓库和公共道路等不可预测环境中。现有算法如FMT*在静态环境中提供渐进最优解，但其单次遍历设计无法进行路径修订，而完全重规划计算成本过高。

Method: 重新审视FMT*的邻居选择规则，通过最小化修改克服其单次遍历限制。维护成本排序的优先级队列，应用选择性更新条件，使用扩展邻居来识别和触发对可能次优路径节点的重新评估。

Result: FMT^x被证明在环境变化后能够恢复渐进最优解。实验结果表明，FMT^x优于有影响力的重规划器RRT^x，对动态事件反应更快，计算开销更低。

Conclusion: FMT^x在保持FMT*固有效率的同时，实现了对障碍物配置变化的鲁棒适应，为不可预测世界中的实时机器人导航提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Path planning in dynamic environments remains a core challenge in robotics,
especially as autonomous systems are deployed in unpredictable spaces such as
warehouses and public roads. While algorithms like Fast Marching Tree
(FMT$^{*}$) offer asymptotically optimal solutions in static settings, their
single-pass design prevents path revisions which are essential for real-time
adaptation. On the other hand, full replanning is often too computationally
expensive. This paper introduces FMT$^{x}$, an extension of the Fast Marching
Tree algorithm that enables efficient and consistent replanning in dynamic
environments. We revisit the neighbor selection rule of FMT$^{*}$ and
demonstrate that a minimal change overcomes its single-pass limitation,
enabling the algorithm to update cost-to-come values upon discovering better
connections without sacrificing asymptotic optimality or computational
efficiency. By maintaining a cost-ordered priority queue and applying a
selective update condition that uses an expanding neighbor to identify and
trigger the re-evaluation of any node with a potentially suboptimal path,
FMT$^{x}$ ensures that suboptimal routes are efficiently repaired as the
environment evolves. This targeted strategy preserves the inherent efficiency
of FMT$^{*}$ while enabling robust adaptation to changes in obstacle
configuration. FMT$^{x}$ is proven to recover an asymptotically optimal
solution after environmental changes. Experimental results demonstrate that
FMT$^{x}$ outperforms the influential replanner RRT$^{x}$, reacting more
swiftly to dynamic events with lower computational overhead and thus offering a
more effective solution for real-time robotic navigation in unpredictable
worlds.

Abstract: This paper presents RoboMatch, a novel unified teleoperation platform for
mobile manipulation with an auto-matching network architecture, designed to
tackle long-horizon tasks in dynamic environments. Our system enhances
teleoperation performance, data collection efficiency, task accuracy, and
operational stability. The core of RoboMatch is a cockpit-style control
interface that enables synchronous operation of the mobile base and dual arms,
significantly improving control precision and data collection. Moreover, we
introduce the Proprioceptive-Visual Enhanced Diffusion Policy (PVE-DP), which
leverages Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) for multi-scale visual feature
extraction and integrates high-precision IMUs at the end-effector to enrich
proprioceptive feedback, substantially boosting fine manipulation performance.
Furthermore, we propose an Auto-Matching Network (AMN) architecture that
decomposes long-horizon tasks into logical sequences and dynamically assigns
lightweight pre-trained models for distributed inference. Experimental results
demonstrate that our approach improves data collection efficiency by over 20%,
increases task success rates by 20-30% with PVE-DP, and enhances long-horizon
inference performance by approximately 40% with AMN, offering a robust solution
for complex manipulation tasks.

Motivation: 随着机器学习模型在高风险场景中的使用增加，需要有效的方法来审计模型的操作设计域(ODD)，确保安全性和合规性

Method: 利用LLM-Agent作为工具协调器，将高维输入空间投影到低维文本嵌入潜在空间，构建不确定性感知的故障分布模型

Result: 在MNIST数据集缺失数字的模型和无人机视觉入侵检测的真实场景中验证了该方法的有效性

Conclusion: 该框架能够自动化地发现专业黑盒模型的故障模式，减少对人力和领域专业知识的需求

Abstract: Specialized machine learning models, regardless of architecture and training,
are susceptible to failures in deployment. With their increasing use in high
risk situations, the ability to audit these models by determining their
operational design domain (ODD) is crucial in ensuring safety and compliance.
However, given the high-dimensional input spaces, this process often requires
significant human resources and domain expertise. To alleviate this, we
introduce \coolname, an LLM-Agent centric framework for automated generation of
semantically relevant test cases to search for failure modes in specialized
black-box models. By leveraging LLM-Agents as tool orchestrators, we aim to fit
a uncertainty-aware failure distribution model on a learned text-embedding
manifold by projecting the high-dimension input space to low-dimension
text-embedding latent space. The LLM-Agent is tasked with iteratively building
the failure landscape by leveraging tools for generating test-cases to probe
the model-under-test (MUT) and recording the response. The agent also guides
the search using tools to probe uncertainty estimate on the low dimensional
manifold. We demonstrate this process in a simple case using models trained
with missing digits on the MNIST dataset and in the real world setting of
vision-based intruder detection for aerial vehicles.

Abstract: Visual navigation in robotics traditionally relies on globally-consistent 3D
maps or learned controllers, which can be computationally expensive and
difficult to generalize across diverse environments. In this work, we present a
novel RGB-only, object-level topometric navigation pipeline that enables
zero-shot, long-horizon robot navigation without requiring 3D maps or
pre-trained controllers. Our approach integrates global topological path
planning with local metric trajectory control, allowing the robot to navigate
towards object-level sub-goals while avoiding obstacles. We address key
limitations of previous methods by continuously predicting local trajectory
using monocular depth and traversability estimation, and incorporating an
auto-switching mechanism that falls back to a baseline controller when
necessary. The system operates using foundational models, ensuring open-set
applicability without the need for domain-specific fine-tuning. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of our method in both simulated environments and real-world
tests, highlighting its robustness and deployability. Our approach outperforms
existing state-of-the-art methods, offering a more adaptable and effective
solution for visual navigation in open-set environments. The source code is

TL;DR: 提出了IRG框架解决移动目标旅行商问题，通过随机采样和广义TSP求解交替进行，实现了渐进最优收敛。开发了两种并行算法IRG-PGLNS和PCG，在三种MT-TSP变体上都表现出比基线方法更快的收敛速度。


<details>

Motivation: 移动目标旅行商问题(MT-TSP)需要寻找代理轨迹来拦截多个移动目标，但在存在非线性目标轨迹或代理运动学约束的情况下，现有算法无法保证收敛到最优解。

Method: 提出迭代随机广义TSP(IRG)框架：交替进行随机采样代理配置-时间点（对应目标拦截点）和通过求解广义TSP(GTSP)来寻找拦截点序列。开发了两种并行算法：IRG-PGLNS（使用并行化GLNS求解器）和PCG（同时求解多个点集的GTSP）。

Result: 在三种MT-TSP变体上测试：距离拦截、变速度Dubins车代理、冗余机械臂代理。IRG-PGLNS和PCG都显示出比基于先前工作的基线方法更快的收敛速度。

Conclusion: IRG框架能够渐进收敛到最优解，提出的两种并行算法在多个实际应用场景中都表现出优越的性能，为解决复杂移动目标拦截问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: The Moving Target Traveling Salesman Problem (MT-TSP) seeks an agent
trajectory that intercepts several moving targets, within a particular time
window for each target. In the presence of generic nonlinear target
trajectories or kinematic constraints on the agent, no prior algorithm
guarantees convergence to an optimal MT-TSP solution. Therefore, we introduce
the Iterated Random Generalized (IRG) TSP framework. The key idea behind IRG is
to alternate between randomly sampling a set of agent configuration-time
points, corresponding to interceptions of targets, and finding a sequence of
interception points by solving a generalized TSP (GTSP). This alternation
enables asymptotic convergence to the optimum. We introduce two parallel
algorithms within the IRG framework. The first algorithm, IRG-PGLNS, solves
GTSPs using PGLNS, our parallelized extension of the state-of-the-art solver
GLNS. The second algorithm, Parallel Communicating GTSPs (PCG), solves GTSPs
corresponding to several sets of points simultaneously. We present numerical
results for three variants of the MT-TSP: one where intercepting a target only
requires coming within a particular distance, another where the agent is a
variable-speed Dubins car, and a third where the agent is a redundant robot
arm. We show that IRG-PGLNS and PCG both converge faster than a baseline based
on prior work.

Conclusion: 该标准为社交机器人导航基础模型的进一步研究奠定了基础，提供了一个框架来探索如何优化VLM以满足实际应用需求。

Abstract: Robot navigation in dynamic, human-centered environments requires
socially-compliant decisions grounded in robust scene understanding. Recent
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) exhibit promising capabilities such as object
recognition, common-sense reasoning, and contextual understanding-capabilities
that align with the nuanced requirements of social robot navigation. However,
it remains unclear whether VLMs can accurately understand complex social
navigation scenes (e.g., inferring the spatial-temporal relations among agents
and human intentions), which is essential for safe and socially compliant robot
navigation. While some recent works have explored the use of VLMs in social
robot navigation, no existing work systematically evaluates their ability to
meet these necessary conditions. In this paper, we introduce the Social
Navigation Scene Understanding Benchmark (SocialNav-SUB), a Visual Question
Answering (VQA) dataset and benchmark designed to evaluate VLMs for scene
understanding in real-world social robot navigation scenarios. SocialNav-SUB
provides a unified framework for evaluating VLMs against human and rule-based
baselines across VQA tasks requiring spatial, spatiotemporal, and social
reasoning in social robot navigation. Through experiments with state-of-the-art
VLMs, we find that while the best-performing VLM achieves an encouraging
probability of agreeing with human answers, it still underperforms simpler
rule-based approach and human consensus baselines, indicating critical gaps in
social scene understanding of current VLMs. Our benchmark sets the stage for
further research on foundation models for social robot navigation, offering a
framework to explore how VLMs can be tailored to meet real-world social robot
navigation needs. An overview of this paper along with the code and data can be

Abstract: Model-free diffusion planners have shown great promise for robot motion
planning, but practical robotic systems often require combining them with
model-based optimization modules to enforce constraints, such as safety.
Naively integrating these modules presents compatibility challenges when
diffusion's multi-modal outputs behave adversarially to optimization-based
modules. To address this, we introduce Joint Model-based Model-free Diffusion
(JM2D), a novel generative modeling framework. JM2D formulates module
integration as a joint sampling problem to maximize compatibility via an
interaction potential, without additional training. Using importance sampling,
JM2D guides modules outputs based only on evaluations of the interaction
potential, thus handling non-differentiable objectives commonly arising from
non-convex optimization modules. We evaluate JM2D via application to aligning
diffusion planners with safety modules on offline RL and robot manipulation.
JM2D significantly improves task performance compared to conventional safety
filters without sacrificing safety. Further, we show that conditional
generation is a special case of JM2D and elucidate key design choices by
comparing with SOTA gradient-based and projection-based diffusion planners.

Motivation: 机器人通常依赖RGB图像进行交互，但可靠交互需要与机器人坐标系对齐的度量尺度3D场景表示。传统方法需要标定板且标定与重建任务分离，多相机设置更加复杂

Conclusion: Calib3R提供了一种无需标定板的联合优化方法，有效解决了相机-机器人标定和度量尺度3D重建的统一问题，适用于各种机器人平台

Abstract: Robots often rely on RGB images for tasks like manipulation and navigation.
However, reliable interaction typically requires a 3D scene representation that
is metric-scaled and aligned with the robot reference frame. This depends on
accurate camera-to-robot calibration and dense 3D reconstruction, tasks usually
treated separately, despite both relying on geometric correspondences from RGB
data. Traditional calibration needs patterns, while RGB-based reconstruction
yields geometry with an unknown scale in an arbitrary frame. Multi-camera
setups add further complexity, as data must be expressed in a shared reference
frame. We present Calib3R, a patternless method that jointly performs
camera-to-robot calibration and metric-scaled 3D reconstruction via unified
optimization. Calib3R handles single- and multi-camera setups on robot arms or
mobile robots. It builds on the 3D foundation model MASt3R to extract pointmaps
from RGB images, which are combined with robot poses to reconstruct a scaled 3D
scene aligned with the robot. Experiments on diverse datasets show that Calib3R
achieves accurate calibration with less than 10 images, outperforming
target-less and marker-based methods.

Conclusion: RoboChemist框架有效解决了机器人化学实验中的挑战，在性能和合规性方面显著优于现有技术，展示了在复杂化学实验中的实用性。

Abstract: Robotic chemists promise to both liberate human experts from repetitive tasks
and accelerate scientific discovery, yet remain in their infancy. Chemical
experiments involve long-horizon procedures over hazardous and deformable
substances, where success requires not only task completion but also strict
compliance with experimental norms. To address these challenges, we propose
\textit{RoboChemist}, a dual-loop framework that integrates Vision-Language
Models (VLMs) with Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models. Unlike prior VLM-based
systems (e.g., VoxPoser, ReKep) that rely on depth perception and struggle with
transparent labware, and existing VLA systems (e.g., RDT, pi0) that lack
semantic-level feedback for complex tasks, our method leverages a VLM to serve
as (1) a planner to decompose tasks into primitive actions, (2) a visual prompt
generator to guide VLA models, and (3) a monitor to assess task success and
regulatory compliance. Notably, we introduce a VLA interface that accepts
image-based visual targets from the VLM, enabling precise, goal-conditioned
control. Our system successfully executes both primitive actions and complete
multi-step chemistry protocols. Results show 23.57% higher average success rate
and a 0.298 average increase in compliance rate over state-of-the-art VLA
baselines, while also demonstrating strong generalization to objects and tasks.

Conclusion: 提出非通用深度伪造分布假说，指出现有方法对未来技术的泛化存在根本性挑战，需要新的解决方案

Abstract: The rapid evolution of deepfake generation technologies poses critical
challenges for detection systems, as non-continual learning methods demand
frequent and expensive retraining. We reframe deepfake detection (DFD) as a
Continual Learning (CL) problem, proposing an efficient framework that
incrementally adapts to emerging visual manipulation techniques while retaining
knowledge of past generators. Our framework, unlike prior approaches that rely
on unreal simulation sequences, simulates the real-world chronological
evolution of deepfake technologies in extended periods across 7 years.
Simultaneously, our framework builds upon lightweight visual backbones to allow
for the real-time performance of DFD systems. Additionally, we contribute two
novel metrics: Continual AUC (C-AUC) for historical performance and Forward
Transfer AUC (FWT-AUC) for future generalization. Through extensive
experimentation (over 600 simulations), we empirically demonstrate that while
efficient adaptation (+155 times faster than full retraining) and robust
retention of historical knowledge is possible, the generalization of current
approaches to future generators without additional training remains near-random
(FWT-AUC $\approx$ 0.5) due to the unique imprint characterizing each existing
generator. Such observations are the foundation of our newly proposed
Non-Universal Deepfake Distribution Hypothesis.
  \textbf{Code will be released upon acceptance.}

Motivation: 现有不可学习方法生成的不可学习样本在多任务数据集上仍然有效，无法真正保护数据所有者权益，需要探究真正不可学习样本的实现距离。

Method: 通过观察干净模型和中毒模型的收敛过程差异，从损失景观角度分析不可学习性，提出Sharpness-Aware Learnability (SAL)来量化参数不可学习性，并基于此提出Unlearnable Distance (UD)来测量数据的不可学习性。

Result: 发现现有不可学习方法在多任务场景下失效，通过损失景观分析揭示了参数优化路径的差异与不可学习性的关系，提出的UD指标能够有效评估现有方法的局限性。

Conclusion: 现有不可学习方法距离实现真正的不可学习样本还有差距，需要从损失景观角度重新思考不可学习性的本质，提出的SAL和UD指标为评估和改进不可学习方法提供了新视角。

Abstract: High-quality data plays an indispensable role in the era of large models, but
the use of unauthorized data for model training greatly damages the interests
of data owners. To overcome this threat, several unlearnable methods have been
proposed, which generate unlearnable examples (UEs) by compromising the
training availability of data. Clearly, due to unknown training purposes and
the powerful representation learning capabilities of existing models, these
data are expected to be unlearnable for models across multiple tasks, i.e.,
they will not help improve the model's performance. However, unexpectedly, we
find that on the multi-task dataset Taskonomy, UEs still perform well in tasks
such as semantic segmentation, failing to exhibit cross-task unlearnability.
This phenomenon leads us to question: How far are we from attaining truly
unlearnable examples? We attempt to answer this question from the perspective
of model optimization. To this end, we observe the difference in the
convergence process between clean and poisoned models using a simple model
architecture. Subsequently, from the loss landscape we find that only a part of
the critical parameter optimization paths show significant differences,
implying a close relationship between the loss landscape and unlearnability.
Consequently, we employ the loss landscape to explain the underlying reasons
for UEs and propose Sharpness-Aware Learnability (SAL) to quantify the
unlearnability of parameters based on this explanation. Furthermore, we propose
an Unlearnable Distance (UD) to measure the unlearnability of data based on the
SAL distribution of parameters in clean and poisoned models. Finally, we
conduct benchmark tests on mainstream unlearnable methods using the proposed
UD, aiming to promote community awareness of the capability boundaries of
existing unlearnable methods.

Abstract: We present JEL, a novel computationally efficient end-to-end multi-neural
network based entity linking model, which beats current state-of-art model.
Knowledge Graphs have emerged as a compelling abstraction for capturing
critical relationships among the entities of interest and integrating data from
multiple heterogeneous sources. A core problem in leveraging a knowledge graph
is linking its entities to the mentions (e.g., people, company names) that are
encountered in textual sources (e.g., news, blogs., etc) correctly, since there
are thousands of entities to consider for each mention. This task of linking
mentions and entities is referred as Entity Linking (EL). It is a fundamental
task in natural language processing and is beneficial in various uses cases,
such as building a New Analytics platform. News Analytics, in JPMorgan, is an
essential task that benefits multiple groups across the firm. According to a
survey conducted by the Innovation Digital team 1 , around 25 teams across the
firm are actively looking for news analytics solutions, and more than \$2
million is being spent annually on external vendor costs. Entity linking is
critical for bridging unstructured news text with knowledge graphs, enabling
users access to vast amounts of curated data in a knowledge graph and
dramatically facilitating their daily work.

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) represent an emerging paradigm
within artificial intelligence, with applications throughout the medical
enterprise. Assessing GenAI applications necessitates a comprehensive
understanding of the clinical task and awareness of the variability in
performance when implemented in actual clinical environments. Presently, a
prevalent method for evaluating the performance of generative models relies on
quantitative benchmarks. Such benchmarks have limitations and may suffer from
train-to-the-test overfitting, optimizing performance for a specified test set
at the cost of generalizability across other task and data distributions.
Evaluation strategies leveraging human expertise and utilizing cost-effective
computational models as evaluators are gaining interest. We discuss current
state-of-the-art methodologies for assessing the performance of GenAI
applications in healthcare and medical devices.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习分布式特性使其容易受到恶意客户端的后门攻击，现有防御措施在面对自适应攻击者时表现不佳，特别是这类强大但未被充分探索的攻击者类型。

Method: 首先设计了一种新的自适应攻击者，其能力超越现有攻击者；然后提出了Hammer and Anvil防御方法，将两种基于不同原理的防御措施相结合，形成组合防御体系。

Result: 新攻击方法仅需20个客户端中的1-2个恶意客户端就能突破现有最先进防御；最佳组合防御Krum+成功抵御了新自适应攻击者和最先进的攻击。

Conclusion: 通过正交防御原理的组合应用，可以构建出能够抵御任何攻击的有效防御体系，Krum+防御在面对强大自适应攻击时表现出色。

Abstract: Federated Learning is a distributed learning technique in which multiple
clients cooperate to train a machine learning model. Distributed settings
facilitate backdoor attacks by malicious clients, who can embed malicious
behaviors into the model during their participation in the training process.
These malicious behaviors are activated during inference by a specific trigger.
No defense against backdoor attacks has stood the test of time, especially
against adaptive attackers, a powerful but not fully explored category of
attackers. In this work, we first devise a new adaptive adversary that
surpasses existing adversaries in capabilities, yielding attacks that only
require one or two malicious clients out of 20 to break existing
state-of-the-art defenses. Then, we present Hammer and Anvil, a principled
defense approach that combines two defenses orthogonal in their underlying
principle to produce a combined defense that, given the right set of
parameters, must succeed against any attack. We show that our best combined
defense, Krum+, is successful against our new adaptive adversary and
state-of-the-art attacks.

Motivation: 基于AI的心电图分析受限于标注数据稀缺，自监督学习可以利用大规模无标注数据，但现有方法缺乏对ECG生理特性的充分考虑。

Method: 提出PhysioCLR框架：1）在预训练中学习临床相关特征的相似样本嵌入；2）整合ECG生理相似性线索到对比学习中；3）设计ECG特异性增强技术；4）采用混合损失函数优化表示质量。

Result: 在Chapman、Georgia两个公共数据集和私有ICU数据集上测试，PhysioCLR相比最强基线平均AUROC提升12%，展现出强大的跨数据集泛化能力。

Conclusion: 通过将生理学知识嵌入对比学习，PhysioCLR能够学习具有临床意义且可迁移的ECG特征，为更有效和标签高效的心电图诊断提供了有前景的路径。

Abstract: Objective: Electrocardiograms (ECGs) play a crucial role in diagnosing heart
conditions; however, the effectiveness of artificial intelligence (AI)-based
ECG analysis is often hindered by the limited availability of labeled data.
Self-supervised learning (SSL) can address this by leveraging large-scale
unlabeled data. We introduce PhysioCLR (Physiology-aware Contrastive Learning
Representation for ECG), a physiology-aware contrastive learning framework that
incorporates domain-specific priors to enhance the generalizability and
clinical relevance of ECG-based arrhythmia classification. Methods: During
pretraining, PhysioCLR learns to bring together embeddings of samples that
share similar clinically relevant features while pushing apart those that are
dissimilar. Unlike existing methods, our method integrates ECG physiological
similarity cues into contrastive learning, promoting the learning of clinically
meaningful representations. Additionally, we introduce ECG- specific
augmentations that preserve the ECG category post augmentation and propose a
hybrid loss function to further refine the quality of learned representations.
Results: We evaluate PhysioCLR on two public ECG datasets, Chapman and Georgia,
for multilabel ECG diagnoses, as well as a private ICU dataset labeled for
binary classification. Across the Chapman, Georgia, and private cohorts,
PhysioCLR boosts the mean AUROC by 12% relative to the strongest baseline,
underscoring its robust cross-dataset generalization. Conclusion: By embedding
physiological knowledge into contrastive learning, PhysioCLR enables the model
to learn clinically meaningful and transferable ECG eatures. Significance:
PhysioCLR demonstrates the potential of physiology-informed SSL to offer a
promising path toward more effective and label-efficient ECG diagnostics.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a novel, multidisciplinary Machine Learning
paradigm where multiple clients, such as mobile devices, collaborate to solve
machine learning problems. Initially introduced in Kone{\v{c}}n{\'y} et al.
(2016a,b); McMahan et al. (2017), FL has gained further attention through its
inclusion in the National AI Research and Development Strategic Plan (2023
Update) of the United States (Science and on Artificial Intelligence, 2023).
The FL training process is inherently decentralized and often takes place in
less controlled settings compared to data centers, posing unique challenges
distinct from those in fully controlled environments. In this thesis, we
identify five key challenges in Federated Learning and propose novel approaches
to address them. These challenges arise from the heterogeneity of data and
devices, communication issues, and privacy concerns for clients in FL training.
Moreover, even well-established theoretical advances in FL require diverse
forms of practical implementation to enhance their real-world applicability.
Our contributions advance FL algorithms and systems, bridging theoretical
advancements and practical implementations. More broadly, our work serves as a
guide for researchers navigating the complexities of translating theoretical
methods into efficient real-world implementations and software. Additionally,
it offers insights into the reverse process of adapting practical
implementation aspects back into theoretical algorithm design. This reverse
process is particularly intriguing, as the practical perspective compels us to
examine the underlying mechanics and flexibilities of algorithms more deeply,
often uncovering new dimensions of the algorithms under study.

Motivation: 扩展传统Transformer架构，通过可信度机制和上下文学习来提高模型学习和预测性能，特别是处理训练数据中未见过的新类别特征。

Method: 在Credibility Transformer基础上增加上下文学习机制，使用相似实例组成的上下文批次来增强CLS令牌表示，实现上下文信息增强和微调。

Result: 实证研究表明，这种上下文学习机制通过适应相似风险模式提高了预测准确性，并且能够泛化到训练时未见过的分类特征水平的新实例。

Conclusion: 提出的上下文学习范式有效提升了Credibility Transformer的性能，特别是在处理新类别特征方面表现出良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: The starting point of our network architecture is the Credibility Transformer
which extends the classical Transformer architecture by a credibility mechanism
to improve model learning and predictive performance. This Credibility
Transformer learns credibilitized CLS tokens that serve as learned
representations of the original input features. In this paper we present a new
paradigm that augments this architecture by an in-context learning mechanism,
i.e., we increase the information set by a context batch consisting of similar
instances. This allows the model to enhance the CLS token representations of
the instances by additional in-context information and fine-tuning. We
empirically verify that this in-context learning enhances predictive accuracy
by adapting to similar risk patterns. Moreover, this in-context learning also
allows the model to generalize to new instances which, e.g., have feature
levels in the categorical covariates that have not been present when the model
was trained -- for a relevant example, think of a new vehicle model which has
just been developed by a car manufacturer.

Abstract: This paper presents a framework for predicting rare, high-impact outcomes by
integrating large language models (LLMs) with a multi-model machine learning
(ML) architecture. The approach combines the predictive strength of black-box
models with the interpretability required for reliable decision-making. We use
LLM-powered feature engineering to extract and synthesize complex signals from
unstructured data, which are then processed within a layered ensemble of models
including XGBoost, Random Forest, and Linear Regression. The ensemble first
produces a continuous estimate of success likelihood, which is then thresholded
to produce a binary rare-event prediction. We apply this framework to the
domain of Venture Capital (VC), where investors must evaluate startups with
limited and noisy early-stage data. The empirical results show strong
performance: the model achieves precision between 9.8X and 11.1X the random
classifier baseline in three independent test subsets. Feature sensitivity
analysis further reveals interpretable success drivers: the startup's category
list accounts for 15.6% of predictive influence, followed by the number of
founders, while education level and domain expertise contribute smaller yet
consistent effects.

Abstract: Fairness-aware classification requires balancing performance and fairness,
often intensified by intersectional biases. Conflicting fairness definitions
further complicate the task, making it difficult to identify universally fair
solutions. Despite growing regulatory and societal demands for equitable AI,
popular toolkits offer limited support for exploring multi-dimensional fairness
and related trade-offs. To address this, we present mmm-fair, an open-source
toolkit leveraging boosting-based ensemble approaches that dynamically
optimizes model weights to jointly minimize classification errors and diverse
fairness violations, enabling flexible multi-objective optimization. The system
empowers users to deploy models that align with their context-specific needs
while reliably uncovering intersectional biases often missed by
state-of-the-art methods. In a nutshell, mmm-fair uniquely combines in-depth
multi-attribute fairness, multi-objective optimization, a no-code, chat-based
interface, LLM-powered explanations, interactive Pareto exploration for model
selection, custom fairness constraint definition, and deployment-ready models
in a single open-source toolkit, a combination rarely found in existing
fairness tools. Demo walkthrough available at: https://youtu.be/_rcpjlXFqkw.

Abstract: Ensuring equitable treatment (fairness) across protected attributes (such as
gender or ethnicity) is a critical issue in machine learning. Most existing
literature focuses on binary classification, but achieving fairness in
regression tasks-such as insurance pricing or hiring score assessments-is
equally important. Moreover, anti-discrimination laws also apply to continuous
attributes, such as age, for which many existing methods are not applicable. In
practice, multiple protected attributes can exist simultaneously; however,
methods targeting fairness across several attributes often overlook so-called
"fairness gerrymandering", thereby ignoring disparities among intersectional
subgroups (e.g., African-American women or Hispanic men). In this paper, we
propose a distance covariance regularisation framework that mitigates the
association between model predictions and protected attributes, in line with
the fairness definition of demographic parity, and that captures both linear
and nonlinear dependencies. To enhance applicability in the presence of
multiple protected attributes, we extend our framework by incorporating two
multivariate dependence measures based on distance covariance: the previously
proposed joint distance covariance (JdCov) and our novel concatenated distance
covariance (CCdCov), which effectively address fairness gerrymandering in both
regression and classification tasks involving protected attributes of various
types. We discuss and illustrate how to calibrate regularisation strength,
including a method based on Jensen-Shannon divergence, which quantifies
dissimilarities in prediction distributions across groups. We apply our
framework to the COMPAS recidivism dataset and a large motor insurance claims
dataset.

Conclusion: MARLINE方法能够有效处理概念漂移问题，在源概念与目标概念不匹配的情况下仍能充分利用多源知识，提高预测性能

Abstract: Concept drift is a major problem in online learning due to its impact on the
predictive performance of data stream mining systems. Recent studies have
started exploring data streams from different sources as a strategy to tackle
concept drift in a given target domain. These approaches make the assumption
that at least one of the source models represents a concept similar to the
target concept, which may not hold in many real-world scenarios. In this paper,
we propose a novel approach called Multi-source mApping with tRansfer LearnIng
for Non-stationary Environments (MARLINE). MARLINE can benefit from knowledge
from multiple data sources in non-stationary environments even when source and
target concepts do not match. This is achieved by projecting the target concept
to the space of each source concept, enabling multiple source sub-classifiers
to contribute towards the prediction of the target concept as part of an
ensemble. Experiments on several synthetic and real-world datasets show that
MARLINE was more accurate than several state-of-the-art data stream learning
approaches.

Abstract: Label concepts in multi-label data streams often experience drift in
non-stationary environments, either independently or in relation to other
labels. Transferring knowledge between related labels can accelerate
adaptation, yet research on multi-label transfer learning for data streams
remains limited. To address this, we propose two novel transfer learning
methods: BR-MARLENE leverages knowledge from different labels in both source
and target streams for multi-label classification; BRPW-MARLENE builds on this
by explicitly modelling and transferring pairwise label dependencies to enhance
learning performance. Comprehensive experiments show that both methods
outperform state-of-the-art multi-label stream approaches in non-stationary
environments, demonstrating the effectiveness of inter-label knowledge transfer
for improved predictive performance.

Result: 实证表明Transformer学习通过识别正确滞后并复制过去对应token来预测下一个token，构建了3层Transformer实现该机制，理论证明其渐近收敛于最大似然解。

Conclusion: 研究推进了对Transformer如何选择因果结构的理解，为其功能和可解释性提供了新见解。

Abstract: Transformers have exhibited exceptional capabilities in sequence modeling
tasks, leveraging self-attention and in-context learning. Critical to this
success are induction heads, attention circuits that enable copying tokens
based on their previous occurrences. In this work, we introduce a novel
framework that showcases transformers' ability to dynamically handle causal
structures. Existing works rely on Markov Chains to study the formation of
induction heads, revealing how transformers capture causal dependencies and
learn transition probabilities in-context. However, they rely on a fixed causal
structure that fails to capture the complexity of natural languages, where the
relationship between tokens dynamically changes with context. To this end, our
framework varies the causal structure through interleaved Markov chains with
different lags while keeping the transition probabilities fixed. This setting
unveils the formation of Selective Induction Heads, a new circuit that endows
transformers with the ability to select the correct causal structure
in-context. We empirically demonstrate that transformers learn this mechanism
to predict the next token by identifying the correct lag and copying the
corresponding token from the past. We provide a detailed construction of a
3-layer transformer to implement the selective induction head, and a
theoretical analysis proving that this mechanism asymptotically converges to
the maximum likelihood solution. Our findings advance the understanding of how
transformers select causal structures, providing new insights into their
functioning and interpretability.

<details>

Motivation: EEG中的伪异信号(肌肉、眼球运动等)影响自动化分析的准确性，但大规模标注成本较高。研究使用现代生成模型来合成实际的、标签明确的伪异段落，以支持数据增帆咄系统压力测试。

Method: 使用TUH EEG伪异数据集，进行主体分割咄固定长度多通道窗口预处理。比较条件WGAN-GP模型(使用投影判别器)咄1D去噪滴流模型(使用分类器免指导)。从三个维度评估：(i)保真度(Welch谱带宽差异、协方差范数、自相关等)；(ii)特异性(类别条件恢复)；(iii)实用性(增帆效果)。

Result: WGAN-GP模型在谱对齐方面表现更好，与真实数据的MMD距离更小。但两种模型在类别条件恢复方面都表现较弱，导致立即的增帆收益有限。这揭示了需要更强大的条件控制咄更广泛的覆盖范围。

Conclusion: 研究为EEG伪异生成建立了可复现的基准线，包括数据清单、训练配置咄评估脚本。WGAN-GP在谱性质保真方面更优，但条件控制仍面挑挑战，为未来工作指明了改进方向。

Abstract: Artifacts in electroencephalography (EEG) -- muscle, eye movement, electrode,
chewing, and shiver -- confound automated analysis yet are costly to label at
scale. We study whether modern generative models can synthesize realistic,
label-aware artifact segments suitable for augmentation and stress-testing.
Using the TUH EEG Artifact (TUAR) corpus, we curate subject-wise splits and
fixed-length multi-channel windows (e.g., 250 samples) with preprocessing
tailored to each model (per-window min-max for adversarial training;
per-recording/channel $z$-score for diffusion). We compare a conditional
WGAN-GP with a projection discriminator to a 1D denoising diffusion model with
classifier-free guidance, and evaluate along three axes: (i) fidelity via Welch
band-power deltas ($\Delta\delta,\ \Delta\theta,\ \Delta\alpha,\ \Delta\beta$),
channel-covariance Frobenius distance, autocorrelation $L_2$, and
distributional metrics (MMD/PRD); (ii) specificity via class-conditional
recovery with lightweight $k$NN/classifiers; and (iii) utility via augmentation
effects on artifact recognition. In our setting, WGAN-GP achieves closer
spectral alignment and lower MMD to real data, while both models exhibit weak
class-conditional recovery, limiting immediate augmentation gains and revealing
opportunities for stronger conditioning and coverage. We release a reproducible
pipeline -- data manifests, training configurations, and evaluation scripts --
to establish a baseline for EEG artifact synthesis and to surface actionable
failure modes for future work.

Abstract: Solving complex partial differential equations is vital in the physical
sciences, but often requires computationally expensive numerical methods.
Reduced-order models (ROMs) address this by exploiting dimensionality reduction
to create fast approximations. While modern ROMs can solve parameterized
families of PDEs, their predictive power degrades over long time horizons. We
address this by (1) introducing a flexible, high-order, yet inexpensive
finite-difference scheme and (2) proposing a Rollout loss that trains ROMs to
make accurate predictions over arbitrary time horizons. We demonstrate our
approach on the 2D Burgers equation.

Conclusion: PS框架能有效处理策略性能异质性，提供完全数据驱动的策略选择方法，在复杂优化问题中具有实用价值

Abstract: We address the problem of policy selection in contextual stochastic
optimization (CSO), where covariates are available as contextual information
and decisions must satisfy hard feasibility constraints. In many CSO settings,
multiple candidate policies--arising from different modeling paradigms--exhibit
heterogeneous performance across the covariate space, with no single policy
uniformly dominating. We propose Prescribe-then-Select (PS), a modular
framework that first constructs a library of feasible candidate policies and
then learns a meta-policy to select the best policy for the observed
covariates. We implement the meta-policy using ensembles of Optimal Policy
Trees trained via cross-validation on the training set, making policy choice
entirely data-driven. Across two benchmark CSO problems--single-stage
newsvendor and two-stage shipment planning--PS consistently outperforms the
best single policy in heterogeneous regimes of the covariate space and
converges to the dominant policy when such heterogeneity is absent. All the

TL;DR: 本文提出了Sketched Gaussian Mechanism (SGM)，将梯度压缩的sketching技术与高斯机制结合，在联邦学习中同时处理通信成本和隐私问题，提供了比单独分析更灵活和更强的隐私保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习中通信成本和隐私保护是两个重要挑战。现有研究通常孤立地分析sketching技术和高斯机制的隐私效果，无法充分利用两者的协同效应。

Method: 提出SGM机制，直接结合sketching和高斯机制，使用Rényi-DP工具进行联合隐私分析，证明隐私水平与sketching维度b的平方根成反比。

Result: 理论证明SGM在相同噪声预算下能提供比原始高斯机制更强的隐私保证，实验显示在相同隐私水平下，基于SGM的联邦学习性能至少与非sketching方法相当，在某些设置中更优。

Conclusion: SGM机制有效结合了sketching和高斯机制的优势，在保持通信效率的同时提供更强的隐私保护，服务器端使用自适应优化器还能进一步提升性能。

Abstract: Communication cost and privacy are two major considerations in federated
learning (FL). For communication cost, gradient compression by sketching the
clients' transmitted model updates is often used for reducing per-round
communication. For privacy, the Gaussian mechanism (GM), which consists of
clipping updates and adding Gaussian noise, is commonly used to guarantee
client-level differential privacy. Existing literature on private FL analyzes
privacy of sketching and GM in an isolated manner, illustrating that sketching
provides privacy determined by the sketching dimension and that GM has to
supply any additional desired privacy.
  In this paper, we introduce the Sketched Gaussian Mechanism (SGM), which
directly combines sketching and the Gaussian mechanism for privacy. Using
R\'enyi-DP tools, we present a joint analysis of SGM's overall privacy
guarantee, which is significantly more flexible and sharper compared to
isolated analysis of sketching and GM privacy. In particular, we prove that the
privacy level of SGM for a fixed noise magnitude is proportional to
$1/\sqrt{b}$, where $b$ is the sketching dimension, indicating that (for
moderate $b$) SGM can provide much stronger privacy guarantees than the
original GM under the same noise budget. We demonstrate the application of SGM
to FL with either gradient descent or adaptive server optimizers, and establish
theoretical results on optimization convergence, which exhibits only a
logarithmic dependence on the number of parameters $d$. Experimental results
confirm that at the same privacy level, SGM based FL is at least competitive
with non-sketching private FL variants and outperforms them in some settings.
Moreover, using adaptive optimization at the server improves empirical
performance while maintaining the privacy guarantees.

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) has seen significant advancements with the
adoption of deep learning techniques, yet challenges remain in terms of data
requirements, reliability and robustness. This paper explores a novel
application of Ensemble Distribution Distillation (EDD) within a
self-supervised learning framework for HAR aimed at overcoming these
challenges. By leveraging unlabeled data and a partially supervised training
strategy, our approach yields an increase in predictive accuracy, robust
estimates of uncertainty, and substantial increases in robustness against
adversarial perturbation; thereby significantly improving reliability in
real-world scenarios without increasing computational complexity at inference.
We demonstrate this with an evaluation on several publicly available datasets.
The contributions of this work include the development of a self-supervised EDD
framework, an innovative data augmentation technique designed for HAR, and
empirical validation of the proposed method's effectiveness in increasing
robustness and reliability.

Abstract: Distributed and federated learning are essential paradigms for training
models across decentralized data sources while preserving privacy, yet
communication overhead remains a major bottleneck. This dissertation explores
strategies to improve communication efficiency, focusing on model compression,
local training, and personalization. We establish a unified framework for
biased and unbiased compression operators with convergence guarantees, then
propose adaptive local training strategies that incorporate personalization to
accelerate convergence and mitigate client drift. In particular, Scafflix
balances global and personalized objectives, achieving superior performance
under both IID and non-IID settings. We further introduce privacy-preserving
pruning frameworks that optimize sparsity while minimizing communication costs,
with Cohort-Squeeze leveraging hierarchical aggregation to reduce cross-device
overhead. Finally, SymWanda, a symmetric post-training pruning method, enhances
robustness under high sparsity and maintains accuracy without retraining.
Extensive experiments on benchmarks and large-scale language models demonstrate
favorable trade-offs among accuracy, convergence, and communication, offering
theoretical and practical insights for scalable, efficient distributed
learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的重症监护EHR数据集（如MIMIC和eICU）虽然推动了临床AI研究，但CRITICAL数据集以其更大的规模和多机构多样性为研究开辟了新前沿，但数据异质性带来了复杂的预处理挑战。

Method: CRISP系统通过四个步骤处理数据：(1)透明数据质量管理与审计追踪，(2)跨词汇表映射到统一SNOMED-CT标准，(3)模块化架构实现并行优化处理，(4)建立全面的基线模型基准测试。

Result: CRISP能够在标准计算硬件上在1天内完成整个数据集处理，提供了处理流水线、基线实现和详细转换文档，大大减少了研究人员的预处理工作量。

Conclusion: CRISP系统释放了CRITICAL数据集的价值，使研究人员能够专注于推进临床AI研究，而不必花费数月时间进行数据预处理，促进了大规模多机构重症监护数据的民主化访问。

Abstract: While existing critical care EHR datasets such as MIMIC and eICU have enabled
significant advances in clinical AI research, the CRITICAL dataset opens new
frontiers by providing extensive scale and diversity -- containing 1.95 billion
records from 371,365 patients across four geographically diverse CTSA
institutions. CRITICAL's unique strength lies in capturing full-spectrum
patient journeys, including pre-ICU, ICU, and post-ICU encounters across both
inpatient and outpatient settings. This multi-institutional, longitudinal
perspective creates transformative opportunities for developing generalizable
predictive models and advancing health equity research. However, the richness
of this multi-site resource introduces substantial complexity in data
harmonization, with heterogeneous collection practices and diverse vocabulary
usage patterns requiring sophisticated preprocessing approaches.
  We present CRISP to unlock the full potential of this valuable resource.
CRISP systematically transforms raw Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership
Common Data Model data into ML-ready datasets through: (1) transparent data
quality management with comprehensive audit trails, (2) cross-vocabulary
mapping of heterogeneous medical terminologies to unified SNOMED-CT standards,
with deduplication and unit standardization, (3) modular architecture with
parallel optimization enabling complete dataset processing in $<$1 day even on
standard computing hardware, and (4) comprehensive baseline model benchmarks
spanning multiple clinical prediction tasks to establish reproducible
performance standards. By providing processing pipeline, baseline
implementations, and detailed transformation documentation, CRISP saves
researchers months of preprocessing effort and democratizes access to
large-scale multi-institutional critical care data, enabling them to focus on
advancing clinical AI.

Conclusion: FAPM是一种有效的剪枝方法，能够显著缓解灾难性遗忘问题，且具有实用性和通用性

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive
capabilities in various downstream tasks but typically face Catastrophic
Forgetting (CF) during fine-tuning. In this paper, we propose the
Forgetting-Aware Pruning Metric (FAPM), a novel pruning-based approach to
balance CF and downstream task performance. Our investigation reveals that the
degree to which task vectors (i.e., the subtraction of pre-trained weights from
the weights fine-tuned on downstream tasks) overlap with pre-trained model
parameters is a critical factor for CF. Based on this finding, FAPM employs the
ratio of the task vector to pre-trained model parameters as a metric to
quantify CF, integrating this measure into the pruning criteria. Importantly,
FAPM does not necessitate modifications to the training process or model
architecture, nor does it require any auxiliary data. We conducted extensive
experiments across eight datasets, covering natural language inference, General
Q&A, Medical Q&A, Math Q&A, reading comprehension, and cloze tests. The results
demonstrate that FAPM limits CF to just 0.25\% while maintaining 99.67\%
accuracy on downstream tasks. We provide the code to reproduce our results.

Abstract: As Vision-Language Models (VLMs) grow in sophistication, their ability to
perform reasoning is coming under increasing supervision. While they excel at
many tasks, their grasp of fundamental scientific principles, such as physics,
remains an underexplored frontier. To reflect the advancements in these
capabilities, we introduce a novel and accessible framework designed to
rigorously evaluate VLMs on their understanding of 2D physics. Our framework
features a pragmatic scenario generator that creates a diverse testbed of over
400 problems across four core domains: Projectile Motion, Collision Dynamics,
Mechanics, and Fluid Dynamics. Through comprehensive evaluation of four
state-of-the-art VLMs, we demonstrate a strong correlation between model scale
and reasoning ability, with our top-performing model, Qwen2.5-VL-7B, achieving
an overall score of 0.815. We find that while models excel at formulaic
problems, they struggle significantly with domains requiring abstract spatial
reasoning. By designing this framework, we aim to democratize the study of
scientific reasoning in VLMs and foster deeper insights into their capabilities
and limitations.

Abstract: Rainfall forecasting in Vietnam is highly challenging due to its diverse
climatic conditions and strong geographical variability across river basins,
yet accurate and reliable forecasts are vital for flood management, hydropower
operation, and disaster preparedness. In this work, we propose a Matrix
Profile-based Weighted Ensemble (MPWE), a regime-switching framework that
dynamically captures covariant dependencies among multiple geographical model
forecasts while incorporating redundancy-aware weighting to balance
contributions across models. We evaluate MPWE using rainfall forecasts from
eight major basins in Vietnam, spanning five forecast horizons (1 hour and
accumulated rainfall over 12, 24, 48, 72, and 84 hours). Experimental results
show that MPWE consistently achieves lower mean and standard deviation of
prediction errors compared to geographical models and ensemble baselines,
demonstrating both improved accuracy and stability across basins and horizons.

Abstract: Deep learning-based Automatic Modulation Recognition (AMR) model has made
significant progress with the support of large-scale labeled data. However,
when developing new models or performing hyperparameter tuning, the time and
energy consumption associated with repeated training using massive amounts of

\emph{FoQuS}, which approximates the effect of full training by selecting a
coreset from the original dataset, thereby significantly reducing training
overhead. Specifically, \emph{FoQuS} records the prediction trajectory of each
sample during full-dataset training and constructs three importance metrics
based on training dynamics. Experiments show that \emph{FoQuS} can maintain
high recognition accuracy and good cross-architecture generalization on
multiple AMR datasets using only 1\%-30\% of the original data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有KV缓存压缩方法依赖启发式策略，忽略了层间特征模式与任务性能的关键交互，导致泛化能力下降

Method: 将缓存分配重新表述为多目标优化问题，利用进化搜索动态配置各层预算，直接最大化下游任务性能

Result: 在11个任务上超越所有基线方法，在GSM8K上比启发式基线提升7个百分点，仅用1.5%原始预算就在代码补全任务上超越完整KV缓存

Conclusion: 学习型压缩策略在KV缓存预算分配方面具有巨大潜力，EvolKV展示了自适应层间压缩的有效性

Abstract: Existing key-value (KV) cache compression methods typically rely on
heuristics, such as uniform cache allocation across layers or static eviction
policies, however, they ignore the critical interplays among layer-specific
feature patterns and task performance, which can lead to degraded
generalization. In this paper, we propose EvolKV, an adaptive framework for
layer-wise, task-driven KV cache compression that jointly optimizes the memory
efficiency and task performance. By reformulating cache allocation as a
multi-objective optimization problem, EvolKV leverages evolutionary search to
dynamically configure layer budgets while directly maximizing downstream
performance. Extensive experiments on 11 tasks demonstrate that our approach
outperforms all baseline methods across a wide range of KV cache budgets on
long-context tasks and surpasses heuristic baselines by up to 7 percentage
points on GSM8K. Notably, EvolKV achieves superior performance over the full KV
cache setting on code completion while utilizing only 1.5% of the original
budget, suggesting the untapped potential in learned compression strategies for
KV cache budget allocation.

Motivation: 强化学习算法在复杂稀疏奖励环境中需要长时间训练，现有加速技术如奖励塑造和课程学习需要领域专业知识且过于特定。

Method: 采用学生-教师架构，使用LLM(Llama、Vicuna、DeepSeek)作为导师为RL算法(DQN、PPO、A2C)提供指导，并探索建议重用机制。在Blackjack、Snake、Connect Four等环境中进行54种配置的实验。

Result: LLM指导显著加速RL收敛并保持可比的最优性能，建议重用机制进一步缩短训练时间但导致收敛动态不太稳定。效果对具体任务、RL算法和LLM模型组合敏感。

Conclusion: LLM指导总体上改善了收敛性，其有效性取决于任务、算法和模型的特定组合，建议重用虽能加速但需注意稳定性问题。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms often require long training to become
useful, especially in complex environments with sparse rewards. While
techniques like reward shaping and curriculum learning exist to accelerate
training, these are often extremely specific and require the developer's
professionalism and dedicated expertise in the problem's domain. Tackling this
challenge, in this study, we explore the effectiveness of pre-trained Large
Language Models (LLMs) as tutors in a student-teacher architecture with RL
algorithms, hypothesizing that LLM-generated guidance allows for faster
convergence. In particular, we explore the effectiveness of reusing the LLM's
advice on the RL's convergence dynamics. Through an extensive empirical
examination, which included 54 configurations, varying the RL algorithm (DQN,
PPO, A2C), LLM tutor (Llama, Vicuna, DeepSeek), and environment (Blackjack,
Snake, Connect Four), our results demonstrate that LLM tutoring significantly
accelerates RL convergence while maintaining comparable optimal performance.
Furthermore, the advice reuse mechanism shows a further improvement in training
duration but also results in less stable convergence dynamics. Our findings
suggest that LLM tutoring generally improves convergence, and its effectiveness
is sensitive to the specific task, RL algorithm, and LLM model combination.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has emerged as a promising architecture for modern
large language models (LLMs). However, massive parameters impose heavy GPU
memory (i.e., VRAM) demands, hindering the widespread adoption of MoE LLMs.
Offloading the expert parameters to CPU RAM offers an effective way to
alleviate the VRAM requirements for MoE inference. Existing approaches
typically cache a small subset of experts in VRAM and dynamically prefetch
experts from RAM during inference, leading to significant degradation in
inference speed due to the poor cache hit rate and substantial expert loading
latency. In this work, we propose MoEpic, an efficient MoE inference system
with a novel expert split mechanism. Specifically, each expert is vertically
divided into two segments: top and bottom. MoEpic caches the top segment of hot
experts, so that more experts will be stored under the limited VRAM budget,
thereby improving the cache hit rate. During each layer's inference, MoEpic
predicts and prefetches the activated experts for the next layer. Since the top
segments of cached experts are exempt from fetching, the loading time is
reduced, which allows efficient transfer-computation overlap. Nevertheless, the
performance of MoEpic critically depends on the cache configuration (i.e., each
layer's VRAM budget and expert split ratio). To this end, we propose a
divide-and-conquer algorithm based on fixed-point iteration for adaptive cache
configuration. Extensive experiments on popular MoE LLMs demonstrate that
MoEpic can save about half of the GPU cost, while lowering the inference
latency by about 37.51%-65.73% compared to the baselines.

*Haeun Jeon,Hyunglip Bae,Chanyeong Kim,Yongjae Lee,Woo Chang Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种通过预测损失梯度扰动决策损失梯度的方法，结合预测聚焦学习和决策聚焦学习的优势，实现更稳定训练和更低遗憾的决策优化


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统预测聚焦学习(PFL)和决策聚焦学习(DFL)各有局限：PFL忽略下游决策质量，DFL因平坦-尖锐损失面导致训练不稳定。需要结合两者优势的方法

Method: 使用预测损失梯度扰动决策损失梯度来构建更新方向，采用sigmoid类衰减参数让预测损失梯度引导决策损失梯度，无需额外训练且可与任何DFL求解器集成

Result: 在三个随机优化问题上验证，相比基线方法获得更低遗憾和更稳定训练，在PFL或DFL单独表现不佳的情况下仍能取得良好效果

Conclusion: 该方法有效结合了PFL的稳定性和DFL的决策质量优化优势，理论上有收敛保证，实践上表现优异，为不确定性下的决策优化提供了新思路

Abstract: Decision-making under uncertainty is often considered in two stages:
predicting the unknown parameters, and then optimizing decisions based on
predictions. While traditional prediction-focused learning (PFL) treats these
two stages separately, decision-focused learning (DFL) trains the predictive
model by directly optimizing the decision quality in an end-to-end manner.
However, despite using exact or well-approximated gradients, vanilla DFL often
suffers from unstable convergence due to its flat-and-sharp loss landscapes. In
contrast, PFL yields more stable optimization, but overlooks the downstream
decision quality. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective approach:
perturbing the decision loss gradient using the prediction loss gradient to
construct an update direction. Our method requires no additional training and
can be integrated with any DFL solvers. Using the sigmoid-like decaying
parameter, we let the prediction loss gradient guide the decision loss gradient
to train a predictive model that optimizes decision quality. Also, we provide a
theoretical convergence guarantee to Pareto stationary point under mild
assumptions. Empirically, we demonstrate our method across three stochastic
optimization problems, showing promising results compared to other baselines.
We validate that our approach achieves lower regret with more stable training,
even in situations where either PFL or DFL struggles.

TL;DR: 论文提出了CI-FFREEDA框架，通过使用冻结的视觉基础模型(VFM)替代传统特征提取器，有效解决了联邦学习中类别不平衡、领域差异和非IID数据问题，显著提升了准确率并降低了计算通信成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的联邦学习研究主要关注聚合和领域适应方法，但在面对源域和目标域类别不平衡、标签偏移以及目标客户端间非IID数据等复杂现实场景时效果有限，需要重新思考特征提取器的重要性。

Method: 采用冻结的视觉基础模型(VFM)作为特征提取器，替代传统的FFREEDA骨干网络，无需大量参数调优，通过强大的预训练特征表示能力来处理领域差异和类别不平衡问题。

Result: 实验结果表明，VFM能够有效缓解领域差距、类别不平衡和目标客户端间非IID性的影响，整体准确率得到显著提升，同时大幅减少了联邦学习中的计算和通信成本。

Conclusion: 在现实世界的联邦学习中，强大的特征提取器比复杂的适应方法或联邦学习算法更为关键，冻结的视觉基础模型为解决类别不平衡联邦源自由领域适应问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) offers a framework for training models
collaboratively while preserving data privacy of each client. Recently,
research has focused on Federated Source-Free Domain Adaptation (FFREEDA), a
more realistic scenario wherein client-held target domain data remains
unlabeled, and the server can access source domain data only during
pre-training. We extend this framework to a more complex and realistic setting:
Class Imbalanced FFREEDA (CI-FFREEDA), which takes into account class
imbalances in both the source and target domains, as well as label shifts
between source and target and among target clients. The replication of existing
methods in our experimental setup lead us to rethink the focus from enhancing
aggregation and domain adaptation methods to improving the feature extractors
within the network itself. We propose replacing the FFREEDA backbone with a
frozen vision foundation model (VFM), thereby improving overall accuracy
without extensive parameter tuning and reducing computational and communication
costs in federated learning. Our experimental results demonstrate that VFMs
effectively mitigate the effects of domain gaps, class imbalances, and even
non-IID-ness among target clients, suggesting that strong feature extractors,
not complex adaptation or FL methods, are key to success in the real-world FL.

Motivation: 解决大语言模型在同态加密环境下进行文本生成时的性能问题，特别是argmax和样本取样等非多项式操作在加密数据上计算成本高的问题，以保护敏感数据的隐私安全。

Result: 对现实LLM输出的评估显示，方案对比基准方法减少了24-35倍的延迟，大大提高了安全文本生成的性能。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了高效的同态加密文本生成方案，解决了性能瓶颈问题，为保护敏感数据隐私的AI应用提供了实用的技术支持，推动了安全文本生成技术的发展。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) power modern AI applications, but processing
sensitive data on untrusted servers raises privacy concerns. Homomorphic
encryption (HE) enables computation on encrypted data for secure inference.
However, neural text generation requires decoding methods like argmax and
sampling, which are non-polynomial and thus computationally expensive under
encryption, creating a significant performance bottleneck. We introduce cutmax,
an HE-friendly argmax algorithm that reduces ciphertext operations compared to
prior methods, enabling practical greedy decoding under encryption. We also
propose the first HE-compatible nucleus (top-p) sampling method, leveraging
cutmax for efficient stochastic decoding with provable privacy guarantees. Both
techniques are polynomial, supporting efficient inference in privacy-preserving
settings. Moreover, their differentiability facilitates gradient-based
sequence-level optimization as a polynomial alternative to straight-through
estimators. We further provide strong theoretical guarantees for cutmax,
proving it converges globally to a unique two-level fixed point, independent of
the input values beyond the identity of the maximizer, which explains its rapid
convergence in just a few iterations. Evaluations on realistic LLM outputs show
latency reductions of 24x-35x over baselines, advancing secure text generation.

Motivation: 图基础模型(GFM)在多域TAGs中学习最优嵌入时遇到域通用性冲突问题，尤其是graph VQ-MAE模型中存在模型退化和表征崩溃两大坑，影响了预训练效果

Method: 提出MoT(Mixture-of-Tinkers)方案：(1)信息调整器-使用边约束语义融合策略和域感知路由的混合代码本提升信息容量；(2)正则化调整器-通过额外正则化改善梯度监督

Result: 在6个域的22个数据集上进行实验，MoT在监督学习、少样本学习和零样本学习场景下都实现了显著性能提升，超越了当前最好的基线方法

Conclusion: MoT作为一种灵活的架构，遵循GFM的缩放法则，提供了可控的模型规模，有效解决了图基础模型中的信息瓶颈和正则化缺陷问题

Abstract: Graph foundation models, inspired by the success of LLMs, are designed to
learn the optimal embedding from multi-domain TAGs for the downstream
cross-task generalization capability. During our investigation, graph VQ-MAE
stands out among the increasingly diverse landscape of GFM architectures. This
is attributed to its ability to jointly encode topology and textual attributes
from multiple domains into discrete embedding spaces with clear semantic
boundaries. Despite its potential, domain generalization conflicts cause
imperceptible pitfalls. In this paper, we instantiate two of them, and they are
just like two sides of the same GFM optimization coin - Side 1 Model
Degradation: The encoder and codebook fail to capture the diversity of inputs;
Side 2 Representation Collapse: The hidden embedding and codebook vector fail
to preserve semantic separability due to constraints from narrow representation
subspaces. These two pitfalls (sides) collectively impair the decoder and
generate the low-quality reconstructed supervision, causing the GFM
optimization dilemma during pre-training (coin). Through empirical
investigation, we attribute the above challenges to Information Bottleneck and
Regularization Deficit. To address them, we propose MoT (Mixture-of-Tinkers) -
(1) Information Tinker for Two Pitfalls, which utilizes an edge-wise semantic
fusion strategy and a mixture-of-codebooks with domain-aware routing to improve
information capacity. (2) Regularization Tinker for Optimization Coin, which
utilizes two additional regularizations to further improve gradient supervision
in our proposed Information Tinker. Notably, as a flexible architecture, MoT
adheres to the scaling laws of GFM, offering a controllable model scale.
Compared to SOTA baselines, experiments on 22 datasets across 6 domains
demonstrate that MoT achieves significant improvements in supervised, few-shot,
and zero-shot scenarios.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated their
remarkable capacity to process and reason over structured and unstructured data
modalities beyond natural language. In this work, we explore the applications
of Vision Language Models (VLMs), specifically a fine-tuned variant of LLaMa
3.2, to the task of identifying neutrino interactions in pixelated detector
data from high-energy physics (HEP) experiments. We benchmark this model
against a state-of-the-art convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture,
similar to those used in the NOvA and DUNE experiments, which have achieved
high efficiency and purity in classifying electron and muon neutrino events.
Our evaluation considers both the classification performance and
interpretability of the model predictions. We find that VLMs can outperform
CNNs, while also providing greater flexibility in integrating auxiliary textual
or semantic information and offering more interpretable, reasoning-based
predictions. This work highlights the potential of VLMs as a general-purpose
backbone for physics event classification, due to their high performance,
interpretability, and generalizability, which opens new avenues for integrating
multimodal reasoning in experimental neutrino physics.

Abstract: This paper introduces the Actuarial Neural Additive Model, an inherently
interpretable deep learning model for general insurance pricing that offers
fully transparent and interpretable results while retaining the strong
predictive power of neural networks. This model assigns a dedicated neural
network (or subnetwork) to each individual covariate and pairwise interaction
term to independently learn its impact on the modeled output while implementing
various architectural constraints to allow for essential interpretability (e.g.
sparsity) and practical requirements (e.g. smoothness, monotonicity) in
insurance applications. The development of our model is grounded in a solid
foundation, where we establish a concrete definition of interpretability within
the insurance context, complemented by a rigorous mathematical framework.
Comparisons in terms of prediction accuracy are made with traditional actuarial
and state-of-the-art machine learning methods using both synthetic and real
insurance datasets. The results show that the proposed model outperforms other
methods in most cases while offering complete transparency in its internal
logic, underscoring the strong interpretability and predictive capability.

Abstract: Process mining aims to extract and analyze insights from event logs, yet
algorithm metric results vary widely depending on structural event log
characteristics. Existing work often evaluates algorithms on a fixed set of
real-world event logs but lacks a systematic analysis of how event log
characteristics impact algorithms individually. Moreover, since event logs are
generated from processes, where characteristics co-occur, we focus on
associational rather than causal effects to assess how strong the overlapping
individual characteristic affects evaluation metrics without assuming isolated
causal effects, a factor often neglected by prior work. We introduce SHAining,
the first approach to quantify the marginal contribution of varying event log
characteristics to process mining algorithms' metrics. Using process discovery
as a downstream task, we analyze over 22,000 event logs covering a wide span of
characteristics to uncover which affect algorithms across metrics (e.g.,
fitness, precision, complexity) the most. Furthermore, we offer novel insights
about how the value of event log characteristics correlates with their
contributed impact, assessing the algorithm's robustness.

Motivation: 研究带重球动量的梯度下降算法的内在机制，通过建立精确的数学描述来理解其优化行为，为分析其他优化算法提供理论框架。

Method: 基于Kovachki和Stuart(2021)的工作，在指数吸引不变流形上分析算法，推导修正损失函数，进行组合数学的精细分析，建立任意阶近似的连续修正方程。

Result: 证明了算法等价于带修正损失函数的普通梯度下降，获得了O(h^R)的全局近似界，发现了包含Eulerian和Narayana多项式的丰富多项式族，推导了任意阶近似的连续修正方程。

Conclusion: 研究结果为理解重球动量梯度下降的主要特征提供了新视角，为类似优化算法的分析提供了路线图，理论结果适用于全批次和小批次HB算法。

Abstract: We analyze gradient descent with Polyak heavy-ball momentum (HB) whose fixed
momentum parameter $\beta \in (0, 1)$ provides exponential decay of memory.
Building on Kovachki and Stuart (2021), we prove that on an exponentially
attractive invariant manifold the algorithm is exactly plain gradient descent
with a modified loss, provided that the step size $h$ is small enough. Although
the modified loss does not admit a closed-form expression, we describe it with
arbitrary precision and prove global (finite "time" horizon) approximation
bounds $O(h^{R})$ for any finite order $R \geq 2$. We then conduct a
fine-grained analysis of the combinatorics underlying the memoryless
approximations of HB, in particular, finding a rich family of polynomials in
$\beta$ hidden inside which contains Eulerian and Narayana polynomials. We
derive continuous modified equations of arbitrary approximation order (with
rigorous bounds) and the principal flow that approximates the HB dynamics,
generalizing Rosca et al. (2023). Approximation theorems cover both full-batch
and mini-batch HB. Our theoretical results shed new light on the main features
of gradient descent with heavy-ball momentum, and outline a road-map for
similar analysis of other optimization algorithms.

Conclusion: 建议在计算资源充足的情况下，通过系统性评估选择优化器，以提升深度学习模型训练的科学性和性能。

Abstract: Optimization has been an important factor and topic of interest in training
deep learning models, yet less attention has been given to how we select the
optimizers we use to train these models. Hence, there is a need to dive deeper
into how we select the optimizers we use for training and the metrics that
determine this selection. In this work, we compare the performance of 10
different optimizers in training a simple Multi-layer Perceptron model using a
heart disease dataset from Kaggle. We set up a consistent training paradigm and
evaluate the optimizers based on metrics such as convergence speed and
stability. We also include some other Machine Learning Evaluation metrics such
as AUC, Precision, and Recall, which are central metrics to classification
problems. Our results show that there are trade-offs between convergence speed
and stability, as optimizers like Adagrad and Adadelta, which are more stable,
took longer time to converge. Across all our metrics, we chose RMSProp to be
the most effective optimizer for this heart disease prediction task because it
offered a balanced performance across key metrics. It achieved a precision of
0.765, a recall of 0.827, and an AUC of 0.841, along with faster training time.
However, it was not the most stable. We recommend that, in less
compute-constrained environments, this method of choosing optimizers through a
thorough evaluation should be adopted to increase the scientific nature and
performance in training deep learning models.

Conclusion: 研究强调了结构化潜在表示对算子学习的重要性，并展示了生成模型与算子网络结合在热设计和更广泛工程应用中的潜力。

Abstract: Generative thermal design for complex geometries is fundamental in many areas
of engineering, yet it faces two main challenges: the high computational cost
of high-fidelity simulations and the limitations of conventional generative
models. Approaches such as autoencoders (AEs) and variational autoencoders
(VAEs) often produce unstructured latent spaces with discontinuities, which
restricts their capacity to explore designs and generate physically consistent
solutions.
  To address these limitations, we propose a hybrid framework that combines
Variational Rank-Reduction Autoencoders (VRRAEs) with Deep Operator Networks
(DeepONets). The VRRAE introduces a truncated SVD within the latent space,
leading to continuous, interpretable, and well-structured representations that
mitigate posterior collapse and improve geometric reconstruction. The DeepONet
then exploits this compact latent encoding in its branch network, together with
spatial coordinates in the trunk network, to predict temperature gradients
efficiently and accurately.
  This hybrid approach not only enhances the quality of generated geometries
and the accuracy of gradient prediction, but also provides a substantial
advantage in inference efficiency compared to traditional numerical solvers.
Overall, the study underscores the importance of structured latent
representations for operator learning and highlights the potential of combining
generative models and operator networks in thermal design and broader
engineering applications.

Abstract: In this work, we focus on the efficiency and scalability of pairwise
constraint-based active clustering, crucial for processing large-scale data in
applications such as data mining, knowledge annotation, and AI model
pre-training. Our goals are threefold: (1) to reduce computational costs for
iterative clustering updates; (2) to enhance the impact of user-provided
constraints to minimize annotation requirements for precise clustering; and (3)
to cut down memory usage in practical deployments. To achieve these aims, we
propose a graph-based active clustering algorithm that utilizes two sparse
graphs: one for representing relationships between data (our proposed data
skeleton) and another for updating this data skeleton. These two graphs work in
concert, enabling the refinement of connected subgraphs within the data
skeleton to create nested clusters. Our empirical analysis confirms that the
proposed algorithm consistently facilitates more accurate clustering with
dramatically less input of user-provided constraints, and outperforms its
counterparts in terms of computational performance and scalability, while
maintaining robustness across various distance metrics.

Abstract: Timely and robust influenza incidence forecasting is critical for public
health decision-making. To address this, we present MAESTRO, a Multi-modal
Adaptive Ensemble for Spectro-Temporal Robust Optimization. MAESTRO achieves
robustness by adaptively fusing multi-modal inputs-including surveillance, web
search trends, and meteorological data-and leveraging a comprehensive
spectro-temporal architecture. The model first decomposes time series into
seasonal and trend components. These are then processed through a hybrid
feature enhancement pipeline combining Transformer-based encoders, a Mamba
state-space model for long-range dependencies, multi-scale temporal
convolutions, and a frequency-domain analysis module. A cross-channel attention
mechanism further integrates information across the different data modalities.
Finally, a temporal projection head performs sequence-to-sequence forecasting,
with an optional estimator to quantify prediction uncertainty. Evaluated on
over 11 years of Hong Kong influenza data (excluding the COVID-19 period),
MAESTRO shows strong competitive performance, demonstrating a superior model
fit and relative accuracy, achieving a state-of-the-art R-square of 0.956.
Extensive ablations confirm the significant contributions of both multi-modal
fusion and the spectro-temporal components. Our modular and reproducible

Conclusion: 安全可信的AI发展需要将解释性作为首要目标，确保系统不仅高效而且可审计、透明、与人类意图对齐

Abstract: Large neural models are increasingly deployed in high-stakes settings,
raising concerns about whether their behavior reliably aligns with human
values. Interpretability provides a route to internal transparency by revealing
the computations that drive outputs. We argue that interpretability especially
mechanistic approaches should be treated as a design principle for alignment,
not an auxiliary diagnostic tool. Post-hoc methods such as LIME or SHAP offer
intuitive but correlational explanations, while mechanistic techniques like
circuit tracing or activation patching yield causal insight into internal
failures, including deceptive or misaligned reasoning that behavioral methods
like RLHF, red teaming, or Constitutional AI may overlook. Despite these
advantages, interpretability faces challenges of scalability, epistemic
uncertainty, and mismatches between learned representations and human concepts.
Our position is that progress on safe and trustworthy AI will depend on making
interpretability a first-class objective of AI research and development,
ensuring that systems are not only effective but also auditable, transparent,
and aligned with human intent.

*Alireza Sameh,Mehrdad Rostami,Mourad Oussalah,Vahid Farrahi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 比较深度学习与经典机器学习算法在24小时运动行为分类中的性能，发现使用原始加速度信号的DL方法略优于基于手工特征的DL和经典ML方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估不同机器学习方法在24小时运动行为（睡眠、久坐、轻度活动、中高强度活动）分类中的表现差异，为运动监测提供方法学参考

Method: 使用151名成年人的手腕加速度计数据，提取104个手工特征，比较4种DL算法（LSTM、BiLSTM、GRU、1D-CNN）和6种经典ML算法（RF、SVM、XGBoost、LR、ANN、DT）的分类性能

Result: 使用原始加速度信号的LSTM、BiLSTM和GRU达到约85%的准确率，1D-CNN约80%；使用手工特征的DL和经典ML算法准确率在70%-81%之间；中高强度活动与轻度活动分类混淆度较高

Conclusion: 基于原始加速度信号的深度学习方法在预测24小时运动行为强度方面仅略优于基于手工特征的深度学习和经典机器学习方法

Abstract: Purpose: We compared the performance of deep learning (DL) and classical
machine learning (ML) algorithms for the classification of 24-hour movement
behavior into sleep, sedentary, light intensity physical activity (LPA), and
moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity (MVPA). Methods: Open-access
data from 151 adults wearing a wrist-worn accelerometer (Axivity-AX3) was used.
Participants were randomly divided into training, validation, and test sets
(121, 15, and 15 participants each). Raw acceleration signals were segmented
into non-overlapping 10-second windows, and then a total of 104 handcrafted
features were extracted. Four DL algorithms-Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM),
Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM), Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), and
One-Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (1D-CNN)-were trained using raw
acceleration signals and with handcrafted features extracted from these signals
to predict 24-hour movement behavior categories. The handcrafted features were
also used to train classical ML algorithms, namely Random Forest (RF), Support
Vector Machine (SVM), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Logistic Regression
(LR), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Decision Tree (DT) for classifying
24-hour movement behavior intensities. Results: LSTM, BiLSTM, and GRU showed an
overall accuracy of approximately 85% when trained with raw acceleration
signals, and 1D-CNN an overall accuracy of approximately 80%. When trained on
handcrafted features, the overall accuracy for both DL and classical ML
algorithms ranged from 70% to 81%. Overall, there was a higher confusion in
classification of MVPA and LPA, compared to sleep and sedentary categories.
Conclusion: DL methods with raw acceleration signals had only slightly better
performance in predicting 24-hour movement behavior intensities, compared to
when DL and classical ML were trained with handcrafted features.

TL;DR: XNNTab是一个可解释的神经网络架构，通过稀疏自编码器学习字典化的单义特征，并为这些特征分配人类可解释的语义，在保持高性能的同时实现完全可解释性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然针对表格数据的DNN在预测性能上很有竞争力，但它们是黑盒模型，缺乏可解释性，这在金融和医疗等关键领域是一个重要问题

Method: 使用稀疏自编码器(SAE)在学习用于预测的潜在空间中学习单义特征的字典，并通过自动化方法为这些特征分配人类可解释的语义

Result: 实证评估显示XNNTab在性能上与或超过最先进的黑盒神经网络模型和经典机器学习方法，同时保持完全可解释性

Conclusion: XNNTab成功解决了表格数据建模中性能与可解释性之间的权衡问题，为关键应用领域提供了既高性能又可解释的解决方案

Abstract: Tabular data is the foundation of many applications in fields such as finance
and healthcare. Although DNNs tailored for tabular data achieve competitive
predictive performance, they are blackboxes with little interpretability. We
introduce XNNTab, a neural architecture that uses a sparse autoencoder (SAE) to
learn a dictionary of monosemantic features within the latent space used for
prediction. Using an automated method, we assign human-interpretable semantics
to these features. This allows us to represent predictions as linear
combinations of semantically meaningful components. Empirical evaluations
demonstrate that XNNTab attains performance on par with or exceeding that of
state-of-the-art, black-box neural models and classical machine learning
approaches while being fully interpretable.

### [140] [An upper bound of the silhouette validation metric for clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08625)
*Hugo Sträng,Tai Dinh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了轮廓系数的新上界计算方法，通过为每个数据点推导尖锐上界，聚合得到数据集相关的ASW上限，解决了传统上限1通常不可达的问题，为聚类质量评估提供了更准确的参考标准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 轮廓系数ASW是常用的聚类质量内部评估指标，但传统的上限1通常无法达到，且数据集特定的最大ASW值未知，这限制了ASW在评估聚类结果优劣时的实用性。

Method: 为给定数据集中的每个数据点推导出其轮廓宽度的尖锐上界，然后通过聚合这些个体上界，得到ASW的规范数据依赖上界。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上，所提出的上界在多数情况下被证明接近紧致，显著丰富了聚类质量评估的能力，能够指示单个数据点是否可能被良好放置，支持基于轮廓的优化循环的早期停止。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了数据集特定的ASW上限，解决了传统上限不切实际的问题，使研究人员能够评估聚类结果与特定数据上最佳可能结果的接近程度，大大提升了轮廓系数在聚类评估中的实用性。

Abstract: The silhouette coefficient summarizes, per observation, cohesion versus
separation in [-1, 1]; the average silhouette width (ASW) is a common internal
measure of clustering quality where higher values indicate more coveted
results. However, the dataset-specific maximum of ASW is typically unknown, and
the standard upper limit 1 is often unattainable. In this work, we derive for
each data point in a given dataset a sharp upper bound on its silhouette width.
By aggregating these individual bounds, we present a canonical data-dependent
upper bound on ASW that often assumes values well below 1. The presented bounds
can indicate whether individual data points can ever be well placed, enable
early stopping of silhouette-based optimization loops, and help answer a key
question: How close is my clustering result to the best possible outcome on
this specific data? Across synthetic and real datasets, the bounds are provably
near-tight in many cases and offer significant enrichment of cluster quality
evaluation.

TL;DR: 提出Generative Data Refinement (GDR)框架，使用预训练生成模型将有不良内容的数据集转换为更适合训练的净化数据集，解决数据耗尽问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着模型参数规模固定，模型能力主要取决于训练数据质量和数量。当前训练数据集增长速度超过网络新数据索引速度，预计未来十年将出现数据耗尽。大量用户生成内容未被公开索引，但直接使用存在隐私泄露和不良内容风险。

Method: 使用预训练生成模型，以真实数据集中的每个样本为条件生成合成数据，将含有不良内容的数据集转换为净化后的数据集。这种方法避免了通过模型提示生成多样化合成数据的挑战。

Result: GDR在数据集匿名化方面优于工业级解决方案，能够直接对高度不安全数据集进行去毒处理。生成的合成数据自然匹配网络规模数据集的多样性。

Conclusion: GDR的简单性和有效性使其成为扩展前沿模型训练数据总量的强大工具，为解决数据耗尽问题提供了有效途径。

Abstract: For a fixed parameter size, the capabilities of large models are primarily
determined by the quality and quantity of its training data. Consequently,
training datasets now grow faster than the rate at which new data is indexed on
the web, leading to projected data exhaustion over the next decade. Much more
data exists as user-generated content that is not publicly indexed, but
incorporating such data comes with considerable risks, such as leaking private
information and other undesirable content. We introduce a framework, Generative
Data Refinement (GDR), for using pretrained generative models to transform a
dataset with undesirable content into a refined dataset that is more suitable
for training. Our experiments show that GDR can outperform industry-grade
solutions for dataset anonymization, as well as enable direct detoxification of
highly unsafe datasets. Moreover, we show that by generating synthetic data
that is conditioned on each example in the real dataset, GDR's refined outputs
naturally match the diversity of web scale datasets, and thereby avoid the
often challenging task of generating diverse synthetic data via model
prompting. The simplicity and effectiveness of GDR make it a powerful tool for
scaling up the total stock of training data for frontier models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习实验结果的复现性一直是挑战，特别是在强化学习领域，算法在实践中往往不稳定。虽然表格RL设置中存在可复制算法，但将其扩展到更实用的函数逼近设置仍是一个开放问题

Method: 首先开发了两种高效算法：可复制随机设计回归和未中心化协方差估计，然后利用这些工具为线性MDP提供了首个可证明高效的可复制RL算法，涵盖生成模型和情景设置

Result: 成功开发了可复制的线性函数逼近RL方法，实验评估显示这些算法能够激发更一致的神经策略

Conclusion: 这项工作在可复制强化学习领域取得了重要进展，为线性函数逼近设置提供了首个可证明的解决方案，对提高RL算法的稳定性和一致性具有重要意义

Abstract: Replication of experimental results has been a challenge faced by many
scientific disciplines, including the field of machine learning. Recent work on
the theory of machine learning has formalized replicability as the demand that
an algorithm produce identical outcomes when executed twice on different
samples from the same distribution. Provably replicable algorithms are
especially interesting for reinforcement learning (RL), where algorithms are
known to be unstable in practice. While replicable algorithms exist for tabular
RL settings, extending these guarantees to more practical function
approximation settings has remained an open problem. In this work, we make
progress by developing replicable methods for linear function approximation in
RL. We first introduce two efficient algorithms for replicable random design
regression and uncentered covariance estimation, each of independent interest.
We then leverage these tools to provide the first provably efficient replicable
RL algorithms for linear Markov decision processes in both the generative model
and episodic settings. Finally, we evaluate our algorithms experimentally and
show how they can inspire more consistent neural policies.

TL;DR: 开发了信号保真度指数(SFI)来量化痴呆诊断数据质量，并通过SFI感知校准显著提高了机器学习模型在不同医疗系统间的泛化性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子健康记录训练的机器学习模型在跨医疗系统时因分布偏移而性能下降，其中诊断信号衰减（诊断质量和一致性的变异性）是一个关键但未被充分探索的因素

Method: 构建模拟框架生成2500个合成数据集，SFI包含6个可解释组件：诊断特异性、时间一致性、熵、上下文一致性、药物对齐和轨迹稳定性。应用SFI感知校准进行乘法调整

Result: 在最优参数下，SFI感知校准显著改善所有指标(p<0.001)，平衡准确率提高10.3%，召回率提高32.5%，精确率提高31.9%，F1分数提高26.1%

Conclusion: 诊断信号衰减是模型泛化的可处理障碍，SFI感知校准为缺乏结果标签的大规模管理数据集提供了实用的无标签策略来增强跨医疗环境的预测能力

Abstract: \textbf{Background:} Machine learning models trained on electronic health
records (EHRs) often degrade across healthcare systems due to distributional
shift. A fundamental but underexplored factor is diagnostic signal decay:
variability in diagnostic quality and consistency across institutions, which
affects the reliability of codes used for training and prediction.
  \textbf{Objective:} To develop a Signal Fidelity Index (SFI) quantifying
diagnostic data quality at the patient level in dementia, and to test SFI-aware
calibration for improving model performance across heterogeneous datasets
without outcome labels.
  \textbf{Methods:} We built a simulation framework generating 2,500 synthetic
datasets, each with 1,000 patients and realistic demographics, encounters, and
coding patterns based on dementia risk factors. The SFI was derived from six
interpretable components: diagnostic specificity, temporal consistency,
entropy, contextual concordance, medication alignment, and trajectory
stability. SFI-aware calibration applied a multiplicative adjustment, optimized
across 50 simulation batches.
  \textbf{Results:} At the optimal parameter ($\alpha$ = 2.0), SFI-aware
calibration significantly improved all metrics (p $<$ 0.001). Gains ranged from
10.3\% for Balanced Accuracy to 32.5\% for Recall, with notable increases in
Precision (31.9\%) and F1-score (26.1\%). Performance approached reference
standards, with F1-score and Recall within 1\% and Balanced Accuracy and
Detection Rate improved by 52.3\% and 41.1\%, respectively.
  \textbf{Conclusions:} Diagnostic signal decay is a tractable barrier to model
generalization. SFI-aware calibration provides a practical, label-free strategy
to enhance prediction across healthcare contexts, particularly for large-scale
administrative datasets lacking outcome labels.

Motivation: 解决聚合学习中通过本地模型泄漏敏感数据的风险，同时避免有限域方法导致的精度损失问题。

Method: 提出基于托秘的安全参数聚合方法，利用托秘上的均匀分布来保证完美隐私。

Conclusion: 基于托秘的安全聚合协议是一种更安全的选择，能够同时实现高精度和完美隐私。

Abstract: In federated learning, multiple parties train models locally and share their
parameters with a central server, which aggregates them to update a global
model. To address the risk of exposing sensitive data through local models,
secure aggregation via secure multiparty computation has been proposed to
enhance privacy. At the same time, perfect privacy can only be achieved by a
uniform distribution of the masked local models to be aggregated. This raises a
problem when working with real valued data, as there is no measure on the reals
that is invariant under the masking operation, and hence information leakage is
bound to occur. Shifting the data to a finite field circumvents this problem,
but as a downside runs into an inherent accuracy complexity tradeoff issue due
to fixed point modular arithmetic as opposed to floating point numbers that can
simultaneously handle numbers of varying magnitudes. In this paper, a novel
secure parameter aggregation method is proposed that employs the torus rather
than a finite field. This approach guarantees perfect privacy for each party's
data by utilizing the uniform distribution on the torus, while avoiding
accuracy losses. Experimental results show that the new protocol performs
similarly to the model without secure aggregation while maintaining perfect
privacy. Compared to the finite field secure aggregation, the torus-based
protocol can in some cases significantly outperform it in terms of model
accuracy and cosine similarity, hence making it a safer choice.

TL;DR: FAUST算法通过将Forward-Forward算法与相似性学习框架结合，消除了推理时需要多次前向传播的问题，显著提高了准确率并接近反向传播的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 反向传播算法存在生物不可信的反向锁定和全局误差传播等限制，Forward-Forward算法虽然更生物可信但准确率较低且推理效率低下。

Method: 将Forward-Forward算法与基于相似性的Tuplet损失函数框架相结合，提出FAUST算法，消除了推理时多次前向传播的需求。

Result: 在MNIST、Fashion-MNIST和CIFAR-10数据集上，FAUST显著提高了准确率。在CIFAR-10上使用简单MLP架构达到56.22%准确率，接近反向传播的57.63%。

Conclusion: FAUST算法成功解决了Forward-Forward算法的推理效率问题，同时大幅提升了准确率，使其更接近反向传播的性能表现。

Abstract: Backpropagation is the pivotal algorithm underpinning the success of
artificial neural networks, yet it has critical limitations such as
biologically implausible backward locking and global error propagation. To
circumvent these constraints, the Forward-Forward algorithm was proposed as a
more biologically plausible method that replaces the backward pass with an
additional forward pass. Despite this advantage, the Forward-Forward algorithm
significantly trails backpropagation in accuracy, and its optimal form exhibits
low inference efficiency due to multiple forward passes required. In this work,
the Forward-Forward algorithm is reshaped through its integration with
similarity learning frameworks, eliminating the need for multiple forward
passes during inference. This proposed algorithm is named Forward-Forward
Algorithm Unified with Similarity-based Tuplet loss (FAUST). Empirical
evaluations on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10 datasets indicate that FAUST
substantially improves accuracy, narrowing the gap with backpropagation. On
CIFAR-10, FAUST achieves 56.22\% accuracy with a simple multi-layer perceptron
architecture, approaching the backpropagation benchmark of 57.63\% accuracy.

Abstract: In the evolving IT landscape, stability and reliability of systems are
essential, yet their growing complexity challenges DevOps teams in
implementation and maintenance. Log analysis, a core element of AIOps, provides
critical insights into complex behaviors and failures. This dissertation
introduces a three-layered architecture to support DevOps in failure
resolution. The first layer, Log Investigation, performs autonomous log
labeling and anomaly classification. We propose a method that labels log data
without manual effort, enabling supervised training and precise evaluation of
anomaly detection. Additionally, we define a taxonomy that groups anomalies
into three categories, ensuring appropriate method selection. The second layer,
Anomaly Detection, detects behaviors deviating from the norm. We propose a
flexible Anomaly Detection method adaptable to unsupervised, weakly supervised,
and supervised training. Evaluations on public and industry datasets show
F1-scores between 0.98 and 1.0, ensuring reliable anomaly detection. The third
layer, Root Cause Analysis, identifies minimal log sets describing failures,
their origin, and event sequences. By balancing training data and identifying
key services, our Root Cause Analysis method consistently detects 90-98% of
root cause log lines within the top 10 candidates, providing actionable
insights for mitigation. Our research addresses how log analysis methods can be
designed and optimized to help DevOps resolve failures efficiently. By
integrating these three layers, the architecture equips teams with robust
methods to enhance IT system reliability.

Motivation: 电刺激映射(ESM)虽然是临床金标准，但具有侵入性和耗时的问题，需要开发非侵入性替代方法来安全识别语言关键皮层区域。

Method: 分析16名参与者的颅内ECoG数据，结合神经活动信号、解剖区域标签和功能连接特征，使用RBF核SVM进行试验级预测，并通过MLP聚合电极级分类。

Conclusion: 结合空间和网络信息的非线性建模能显著改善术前功能映射评估，为替代ESM提供了有前景的非侵入性方法。

Abstract: Identifying cortical regions critical for speech is essential for safe brain
surgery in or near language areas. While Electrical Stimulation Mapping (ESM)
remains the clinical gold standard, it is invasive and time-consuming. To
address this, we analyzed intracranial electrocorticographic (ECoG) data from
16 participants performing speech tasks and developed machine learning models
to directly predict if the brain region underneath each ECoG electrode is
critical. Ground truth labels indicating speech arrest were derived
independently from Electrical Stimulation Mapping (ESM) and used to train
classification models. Our framework integrates neural activity signals,
anatomical region labels, and functional connectivity features to capture both
local activity and network-level dynamics. We found that models combining
region and connectivity features matched the performance of the full feature
set, and outperformed models using either type alone. To classify each
electrode, trial-level predictions were aggregated using an MLP applied to
histogram-encoded scores. Our best-performing model, a trial-level RBF-kernel
Support Vector Machine together with MLP-based aggregation, achieved strong
accuracy on held-out participants (ROC-AUC: 0.87, PR-AUC: 0.57). These findings
highlight the value of combining spatial and network information with
non-linear modeling to improve functional mapping in presurgical evaluation.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的服务器扩展方案，通过使用短暂性可信执行环境（TEE）模块和客户端审计机制，实现了恶意环境下的差分隐私DP-FTRL方案，解决了现有方案在安全性和可用性方面的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的DP-FTRL方案假设服务器是半安全的，而在实际应用中客户端可能丢包或被攻击，导致状态管理问题。直接使用TEE可能引入分叉攻击或可用性问题。

Method: 设计了一个作为可信计算基础（TCB）的服务器扩展，通过短暂性TEE模块生成服务器操作的可验证证明。选中的部分客户参与审计这些证明，仅需小量额外通信和计算开销。

Result: 该方案在减小TCB规模的同时保持了系统的可扩展性和活性。通过交互式差分隐私进行了正式证明，展示在恶意环境下的隐私保证。实验结果显示在多个实际场景中，该框架仅给客户端带来小常数额外开销。

Conclusion: 该研究成功地解决了恶意环境下DP-FTRL的安全性挑战，通过创新的TEE基于TCB设计和客户端审计机制，在保持系统效能的同时提供了强大的安全保障。

Abstract: In cross-device private federated learning, differentially private
follow-the-regularized-leader (DP-FTRL) has emerged as a promising
privacy-preserving method. However, existing approaches assume a semi-honest
server and have not addressed the challenge of securely removing this
assumption. This is due to its statefulness, which becomes particularly
problematic in practical settings where clients can drop out or be corrupted.
While trusted execution environments (TEEs) might seem like an obvious
solution, a straightforward implementation can introduce forking attacks or
availability issues due to state management. To address this problem, our paper
introduces a novel server extension that acts as a trusted computing base (TCB)
to realize maliciously secure DP-FTRL. The TCB is implemented with an ephemeral
TEE module on the server side to produce verifiable proofs of server actions.
Some clients, upon being selected, participate in auditing these proofs with
small additional communication and computational demands. This extension
solution reduces the size of the TCB while maintaining the system's scalability
and liveness. We provide formal proofs based on interactive differential
privacy, demonstrating privacy guarantee in malicious settings. Finally, we
experimentally show that our framework adds small constant overhead to clients
in several realistic settings.

Conclusion: 混合剪枝框架是一种有效的模型压缩方法，能够在保持模型性能的同时显著减少模型规模，为边缘设备部署提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have achieved significant breakthroughs
in various fields. However, these advancements have led to a substantial
increase in the complexity and size of these networks. This poses a challenge
when deploying large and complex networks on edge devices. Consequently, model
compression has emerged as a research field aimed at reducing the size and
complexity of CNNs. One prominent technique in model compression is model
pruning. This paper will present a new technique of pruning that combines both
channel and layer pruning in what is called a "hybrid pruning framework".
Inspired by EfficientNet, a renowned CNN architecture known for scaling up
networks from both channel and layer perspectives, this hybrid approach applies
the same principles but in reverse, where it scales down the network through
pruning. Experiments on the hybrid approach demonstrated a notable decrease in
the overall complexity of the model, with only a minimal reduction in accuracy
compared to the baseline model. This complexity reduction translates into
reduced latency when deploying the pruned models on an NVIDIA JETSON TX2
embedded AI device.

Conclusion: SAPO提供了一种有效解决RL后训练扩展挑战的去中心化方法，允许网络传播"顿悟时刻"来引导学习过程，为大规模RL训练开辟了新可能性。

Abstract: Post-training language models (LMs) with reinforcement learning (RL) can
enhance their complex reasoning capabilities without supervised fine-tuning, as
demonstrated by DeepSeek-R1-Zero. However, effectively utilizing RL for LMs
requires significant parallelization to scale-up inference, which introduces
non-trivial technical challenges (e.g. latency, memory, and reliability)
alongside ever-growing financial costs. We present Swarm sAmpling Policy
Optimization (SAPO), a fully decentralized and asynchronous RL post-training
algorithm. SAPO is designed for decentralized networks of heterogenous compute
nodes, where each node manages its own policy model(s) while "sharing" rollouts
with others in the network; no explicit assumptions about latency, model
homogeneity, or hardware are required and nodes can operate in silo if desired.
As a result, the algorithm avoids common bottlenecks in scaling RL
post-training while also allowing (and even encouraging) new possibilities. By
sampling rollouts "shared" across the network, it enables "Aha moments" to
propagate, thereby bootstrapping the learning process. In this paper we show
SAPO achieved cumulative reward gains of up to 94% in controlled experiments.
We also share insights from tests on a network with thousands of nodes
contributed by Gensyn community members running the algorithm on diverse
hardware and models during an open-source demo.

Conclusion: 渗透模型在金融分析和决策中具有广阔的应用前景，能够通过数据驱动的方式生成随机微分方程的样本路径，无需明确的数学模型

Abstract: This paper introduces a new approach to generating sample paths of unknown
stochastic differential equations (SDEs) using diffusion models, a class of
generative AI models commonly employed in image and video applications. Unlike
the traditional Monte Carlo methods for simulating SDEs, which require explicit
specifications of the drift and diffusion coefficients, our method takes a
model-free, data-driven approach. Given a finite set of sample paths from an
SDE, we utilize conditional diffusion models to generate new, synthetic paths
of the same SDE. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct a
simulation experiment to compare our method with alternative benchmark ones
including neural SDEs. Furthermore, in an empirical study we leverage these
synthetically generated sample paths to enhance the performance of
reinforcement learning algorithms for continuous-time mean-variance portfolio
selection, hinting promising applications of diffusion models in financial
analysis and decision-making.

Conclusion: 通过利用分子动力学模拟的连续性特征，深度平衡模型方法能有效提升机器学习力场的性能和效率

Abstract: Machine learning force fields show great promise in enabling more accurate
molecular dynamics simulations compared to manually derived ones. Much of the
progress in recent years was driven by exploiting prior knowledge about
physical systems, in particular symmetries under rotation, translation, and
reflections. In this paper, we argue that there is another important piece of
prior information that, thus fa,r hasn't been explored: Simulating a molecular
system is necessarily continuous, and successive states are therefore extremely
similar. Our contribution is to show that we can exploit this information by
recasting a state-of-the-art equivariant base model as a deep equilibrium
model. This allows us to recycle intermediate neural network features from
previous time steps, enabling us to improve both accuracy and speed by
$10\%-20\%$ on the MD17, MD22, and OC20 200k datasets, compared to the non-DEQ
base model. The training is also much more memory efficient, allowing us to
train more expressive models on larger systems.

Motivation: 化学领域的贝叶斯优化经常受到稀疏实验数据和复杂反应机制的限制，需要一种能够有效利用化学知识并加速优化过程的新方法。

Method: 提出ChemBOMAS框架，采用双阶段策略：1）知识驱动的粗粒度优化阶段，LLM通过推理化学知识分解搜索空间；2）数据驱动的细粒度优化阶段，LLM生成伪数据点增强BO过程。

Result: 基准评估显示ChemBOMAS显著优于多种BO算法。湿实验验证中，在药物工业协议下对未报道的挑战性化学反应进行条件优化，达到96%的最优目标值，远超领域专家的15%。

Conclusion: ChemBOMAS是一个强大的工具，能够有效加速化学发现过程，在真实世界应用中表现出色。

Abstract: The efficiency of Bayesian optimization (BO) in chemistry is often hindered
by sparse experimental data and complex reaction mechanisms. To overcome these
limitations, we introduce ChemBOMAS, a new framework named LLM-Enhanced
Multi-Agent System for accelerating BO in chemistry. ChemBOMAS's optimization
process is enhanced by LLMs and synergistically employs two strategies:
knowledge-driven coarse-grained optimization and data-driven fine-grained
optimization. First, in the knowledge-driven coarse-grained optimization stage,
LLMs intelligently decompose the vast search space by reasoning over existing
chemical knowledge to identify promising candidate regions. Subsequently, in
the data-driven fine-grained optimization stage, LLMs enhance the BO process
within these candidate regions by generating pseudo-data points, thereby
improving data utilization efficiency and accelerating convergence. Benchmark
evaluations** further confirm that ChemBOMAS significantly enhances
optimization effectiveness and efficiency compared to various BO algorithms.
Importantly, the practical utility of ChemBOMAS was validated through wet-lab
experiments conducted under pharmaceutical industry protocols, targeting
conditional optimization for a previously unreported and challenging chemical
reaction. In the wet experiment, ChemBOMAS achieved an optimal objective value
of 96%. This was substantially higher than the 15% achieved by domain experts.
This real-world success, together with strong performance on benchmark
evaluations, highlights ChemBOMAS as a powerful tool to accelerate chemical
discovery.

Motivation: 当前异构模型联邦学习算法缺乏在实际边缘设备约束下的系统性评估和定量分析，需要重新考察这种范式的实际应用性。

Method: 构建PracMHBench评测平台，将多样化异构模型算法分类并在多种数据任务和指标上进行测试，在不同边缘约束下进行涉幅实验。

Result: 通过平台评测观察到各算法在实际边缘约束下的适用性和对应的异构模式。

Conclusion: 该研究为异构模型联邦学习领域提供了第一个系统性的实践性能评估框架，有助于理解不同算法在实际部署环境下的表现。

Abstract: Federating heterogeneous models on edge devices with diverse resource
constraints has been a notable trend in recent years. Compared to traditional
federated learning (FL) that assumes an identical model architecture to
cooperate, model-heterogeneous FL is more practical and flexible since the
model can be customized to satisfy the deployment requirement. Unfortunately,
no prior work ever dives into the existing model-heterogeneous FL algorithms
under the practical edge device constraints and provides quantitative analysis
on various data scenarios and metrics, which motivates us to rethink and
re-evaluate this paradigm. In our work, we construct the first system platform
\textbf{PracMHBench} to evaluate model-heterogeneous FL on practical
constraints of edge devices, where diverse model heterogeneity algorithms are
classified and tested on multiple data tasks and metrics. Based on the
platform, we perform extensive experiments on these algorithms under the
different edge constraints to observe their applicability and the corresponding
heterogeneity pattern.

Abstract: Developing autonomous LLM agents capable of making a series of intelligent
decisions to solve complex, real-world tasks is a fast-evolving frontier. Like
human cognitive development, agents are expected to acquire knowledge and
skills through exploration and interaction with the environment. Despite
advances, the community still lacks a unified, interactive reinforcement
learning (RL) framework that can effectively train such agents from scratch --
without relying on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) -- across diverse and realistic
environments. To bridge this gap, we introduce AgentGym-RL, a new framework to
train LLM agents for multi-turn interactive decision-making through RL. The
framework features a modular and decoupled architecture, ensuring high
flexibility and extensibility. It encompasses a wide variety of real-world
scenarios, and supports mainstream RL algorithms. Furthermore, we propose
ScalingInter-RL, a training approach designed for exploration-exploitation
balance and stable RL optimization. In early stages, it emphasizes exploitation
by restricting the number of interactions, and gradually shifts towards
exploration with larger horizons to encourage diverse problem-solving
strategies. In this way, the agent develops more diverse behaviors and is less
prone to collapse under long horizons. We perform extensive experiments to
validate the stability and effectiveness of both the AgentGym-RL framework and
the ScalingInter-RL approach. Our agents match or surpass commercial models on
27 tasks across diverse environments. We offer key insights and will
open-source the complete AgentGym-RL framework -- including code and datasets
-- to empower the research community in developing the next generation of
intelligent agents.

Motivation: 大规模伤交事件给医疗系统带来巨大压力，需要在极端压力下做出快速准确的患者-医院分配决策。传统方法存在效率低下、一致性差等问题。

Method: 开发了基于深度强化学习的决策支持AI系统，统筹患者病情程度、专科治疗需求、医院容量和运输逻辑。构建了MasTER网页管理控制面板，并通过30名参与者（6名专家+24名非专家）在20和60名患者的仿真场景中评估了三种交互模式。

Conclusion: 这个AI驱动的决策支持系统在大规模伤交事件的预防培训和实际应急响应管理中具有重要应用潜力，可以提高效率和效果。

Abstract: Mass casualty incidents (MCIs) overwhelm healthcare systems and demand rapid,
accurate patient-hospital allocation decisions under extreme pressure. Here, we
developed and validated a deep reinforcement learning-based decision-support AI
agent to optimize patient transfer decisions during simulated MCIs by balancing
patient acuity levels, specialized care requirements, hospital capacities, and
transport logistics. To integrate this AI agent, we developed MasTER, a
web-accessible command dashboard for MCI management simulations. Through a
controlled user study with 30 participants (6 trauma experts and 24
non-experts), we evaluated three interaction approaches with the AI agent
(human-only, human-AI collaboration, and AI-only) across 20- and 60-patient MCI
scenarios in the Greater Toronto Area. Results demonstrate that increasing AI
involvement significantly improves decision quality and consistency. The AI
agent outperforms trauma surgeons (p < 0.001) and enables non-experts to
achieve expert-level performance when assisted, contrasting sharply with their
significantly inferior unassisted performance (p < 0.001). These findings
establish the potential for our AI-driven decision support to enhance both MCI
preparedness training and real-world emergency response management.

Result: FLM在偏微分方程和最优控制问题等科学计算任务中表现优于或相当于SIREN和传统前馈神经网络。

Conclusion: FLM是第一个能够在多维空间中表示完整可分离傅里叶基的标准MLP类架构，为科学计算提供了有效的神经网络解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce the Fourier Learning Machine (FLM), a neural network (NN)
architecture designed to represent a multidimensional nonharmonic Fourier
series. The FLM uses a simple feedforward structure with cosine activation
functions to learn the frequencies, amplitudes, and phase shifts of the series
as trainable parameters. This design allows the model to create a
problem-specific spectral basis adaptable to both periodic and nonperiodic
functions. Unlike previous Fourier-inspired NN models, the FLM is the first
architecture able to represent a complete, separable Fourier basis in multiple
dimensions using a standard Multilayer Perceptron-like architecture. A
one-to-one correspondence between the Fourier coefficients and amplitudes and
phase-shifts is demonstrated, allowing for the translation between a full,
separable basis form and the cosine phase--shifted one. Additionally, we
evaluate the performance of FLMs on several scientific computing problems,
including benchmark Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) and a family of
Optimal Control Problems (OCPs). Computational experiments show that the
performance of FLMs is comparable, and often superior, to that of established
architectures like SIREN and vanilla feedforward NNs.

Abstract: Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a common brain disorder in
children that can persist into adulthood, affecting social, academic, and
career life. Early diagnosis is crucial for managing these impacts on patients
and the healthcare system but is often labor-intensive and time-consuming. This
paper presents a novel method to improve ADHD diagnosis precision and
timeliness by leveraging Deep Learning (DL) approaches and electroencephalogram
(EEG) signals. We introduce ADHDeepNet, a DL model that utilizes comprehensive
temporal-spatial characterization, attention modules, and explainability
techniques optimized for EEG signals. ADHDeepNet integrates feature extraction
and refinement processes to enhance ADHD diagnosis. The model was trained and
validated on a dataset of 121 participants (61 ADHD, 60 Healthy Controls),
employing nested cross-validation for robust performance. The proposed
two-stage methodology uses a 10-fold cross-subject validation strategy.
Initially, each iteration optimizes the model's hyper-parameters with inner
2-fold cross-validation. Then, Additive Gaussian Noise (AGN) with various
standard deviations and magnification levels is applied for data augmentation.
ADHDeepNet achieved 100% sensitivity and 99.17% accuracy in classifying ADHD/HC
subjects. To clarify model explainability and identify key brain regions and
frequency bands for ADHD diagnosis, we analyzed the learned weights and
activation patterns of the model's primary layers. Additionally, t-distributed
Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) visualized high-dimensional data, aiding
in interpreting the model's decisions. This study highlights the potential of
DL and EEG in enhancing ADHD diagnosis accuracy and efficiency.

Motivation: 传统推理蒸馏方法假设单一最优教师，但实际中存在多个候选教师和CoT语料库，不同学生的最佳教师不同，同一学生在不同数据集上的最佳教师也不同。

Method: 提出Merge-of-Thought Distillation (MoT)框架，交替进行教师特定的监督微调分支和权重空间合并，统一多个教师的推理能力。

Result: 在数学竞赛基准测试中，仅使用约200个高质量CoT样本，Qwen3-14B学生模型超越了多个强模型，性能显著提升，优于最佳单教师蒸馏和朴素多教师联合方法。

Conclusion: MoT是一种简单、可扩展的方法，能够高效地从多样化教师向紧凑学生模型蒸馏长链推理能力，具有鲁棒性和广泛迁移性。

Abstract: Efficient reasoning distillation for long chain-of-thought (CoT) models is
increasingly constrained by the assumption of a single oracle teacher, despite
practical availability of multiple candidate teachers and growing CoT corpora.
We revisit teacher selection and observe that different students have different
"best teachers," and even for the same student the best teacher can vary across
datasets. Therefore, to unify multiple teachers' reasoning abilities into
student with overcoming conflicts among various teachers' supervision, we
propose Merge-of-Thought Distillation (MoT), a lightweight framework that
alternates between teacher-specific supervised fine-tuning branches and
weight-space merging of the resulting student variants. On competition math
benchmarks, using only about 200 high-quality CoT samples, applying MoT to a
Qwen3-14B student surpasses strong models including DEEPSEEK-R1, QWEN3-30B-A3B,
QWEN3-32B, and OPENAI-O1, demonstrating substantial gains. Besides, MoT
consistently outperforms the best single-teacher distillation and the naive
multi-teacher union, raises the performance ceiling while mitigating
overfitting, and shows robustness to distribution-shifted and peer-level
teachers. Moreover, MoT reduces catastrophic forgetting, improves general
reasoning beyond mathematics and even cultivates a better teacher, indicating
that consensus-filtered reasoning features transfer broadly. These results
position MoT as a simple, scalable route to efficiently distilling long CoT
capabilities from diverse teachers into compact students.

Abstract: Honey bee colonies are essential for global food security and ecosystem
stability, yet they face escalating threats from pests, diseases, and
environmental stressors. Traditional hive inspections are labor-intensive and
disruptive, while cloud-based monitoring solutions remain impractical for
remote or resource-limited apiaries. Recent advances in Internet of Things
(IoT) and Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML) enable low-power, real-time monitoring
directly on edge devices, offering scalable and non-invasive alternatives. This
survey synthesizes current innovations at the intersection of TinyML and
apiculture, organized around four key functional areas: monitoring hive
conditions, recognizing bee behaviors, detecting pests and diseases, and
forecasting swarming events. We further examine supporting resources, including
publicly available datasets, lightweight model architectures optimized for
embedded deployment, and benchmarking strategies tailored to field constraints.
Critical limitations such as data scarcity, generalization challenges, and
deployment barriers in off-grid environments are highlighted, alongside
emerging opportunities in ultra-efficient inference pipelines, adaptive edge
learning, and dataset standardization. By consolidating research and
engineering practices, this work provides a foundation for scalable, AI-driven,
and ecologically informed monitoring systems to support sustainable pollinator
management.
