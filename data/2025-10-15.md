### [1] [Enhancing the Quality of 3D Lunar Maps Using JAXA's Kaguya Imagery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11817)
*Yumi Iwashita,Haakon Moe,Yang Cheng,Adnan Ansar,Georgios Georgakis,Adrian Stoica,Kazuto Nakashima,Ryo Kurazume,Jim Torresen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种改进Kaguya TC图像3D地图质量的方法，通过减少压缩图像生成的视差图中的残余噪声来提升月球地形数据的安全性和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着月球探索任务增加，需要高质量3D月球地图，特别是长距离任务如NASA的Endurance任务。Kaguya TC图像虽然全球可用，但存在立体匹配误差和JPEG压缩伪影导致的海拔不准确问题。

Method: 分析Kaguya TC图像的压缩行为，识别系统性视差噪声模式，特别是在暗区。提出通过减少压缩图像生成的视差图中的残余噪声来增强3D地图质量的方法。

Result: 实验结果表明，所提出的方法有效减少了海拔噪声。

Conclusion: 该方法提高了月球地形数据的安全性和可靠性，对未来月球任务具有重要意义。

Abstract: As global efforts to explore the Moon intensify, the need for high-quality 3D
lunar maps becomes increasingly critical-particularly for long-distance
missions such as NASA's Endurance mission concept, in which a rover aims to
traverse 2,000 km across the South Pole-Aitken basin. Kaguya TC (Terrain
Camera) images, though globally available at 10 m/pixel, suffer from altitude
inaccuracies caused by stereo matching errors and JPEG-based compression
artifacts. This paper presents a method to improve the quality of 3D maps
generated from Kaguya TC images, focusing on mitigating the effects of
compression-induced noise in disparity maps. We analyze the compression
behavior of Kaguya TC imagery, and identify systematic disparity noise
patterns, especially in darker regions. In this paper, we propose an approach
to enhance 3D map quality by reducing residual noise in disparity images
derived from compressed images. Our experimental results show that the proposed
approach effectively reduces elevation noise, enhancing the safety and
reliability of terrain data for future lunar missions.

### [2] [Data or Language Supervision: What Makes CLIP Better than DINO?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11835)
*Yiming Liu,Yuhui Zhang,Dhruba Ghosh,Ludwig Schmidt,Serena Yeung-Levy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLIP在视觉语言模型中优于自监督模型DINO，但这种优势主要源于语言监督而非训练数据量。在控制实验条件下，CLIP擅长捕捉高层语义，DINO更关注低层特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究CLIP在视觉语言模型中优于DINO的原因，是源于语言监督还是更大的训练数据量。

Method: 在相同架构、数据集和训练配置下预训练CLIP和DINO，分析嵌入特征，并在20个VQA基准上进行评估。

Result: CLIP擅长文本密集型任务，DINO在视觉中心任务上略优；语言监督变体带来的提升有限。

Conclusion: 语言监督使CLIP能更好地捕捉高层语义，这为视觉编码器设计和VLM性能提供了科学见解。

Abstract: CLIP outperforms self-supervised models like DINO as vision encoders for
vision-language models (VLMs), but it remains unclear whether this advantage
stems from CLIP's language supervision or its much larger training data. To
disentangle these factors, we pre-train CLIP and DINO under controlled settings
-- using the same architecture, dataset, and training configuration --
achieving similar ImageNet accuracy. Embedding analysis shows that CLIP
captures high-level semantics (e.g., object categories, text), while DINO is
more responsive to low-level features like colors and styles. When integrated
into VLMs and evaluated on 20 VQA benchmarks, CLIP excels at text-intensive
tasks, while DINO slightly outperforms on vision-centric ones. Variants of
language supervision (e.g., sigmoid loss, pre-trained language encoders) yield
limited gains. Our findings provide scientific insights into vision encoder
design and its impact on VLM performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MammoDINO是一个用于乳腺X线摄影的自监督学习框架，在140万张乳腺图像上预训练，通过创新的数据增强和对比学习目标，在多个乳腺癌筛查任务中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自监督学习在通用领域已成功应用于视觉编码器训练，但在医学影像中由于数据有限和领域特定偏差而应用不足。本文旨在开发专门针对乳腺X线摄影的SSL框架。

Method: 引入乳腺组织感知数据增强采样器进行图像级和块级监督，以及利用3D数字乳腺断层合成结构进行2D预训练的跨切片对比学习目标。

Result: 在多个乳腺癌筛查任务中达到最先进性能，并在五个基准数据集上表现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: MammoDINO为乳腺X线摄影提供了可扩展、无需标注的多用途计算机辅助诊断工具基础，有助于减轻放射科医生工作量并提高乳腺癌筛查的诊断效率。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has transformed vision encoder training in
general domains but remains underutilized in medical imaging due to limited
data and domain specific biases. We present MammoDINO, a novel SSL framework
for mammography, pretrained on 1.4 million mammographic images. To capture
clinically meaningful features, we introduce a breast tissue aware data
augmentation sampler for both image-level and patch-level supervision and a
cross-slice contrastive learning objective that leverages 3D digital breast
tomosynthesis (DBT) structure into 2D pretraining. MammoDINO achieves
state-of-the-art performance on multiple breast cancer screening tasks and
generalizes well across five benchmark datasets. It offers a scalable,
annotation-free foundation for multipurpose computer-aided diagnosis (CAD)
tools for mammogram, helping reduce radiologists' workload and improve
diagnostic efficiency in breast cancer screening.

Motivation: 交通安分析需要复杂的视频理解来捕捉细粒度行为模式并生成全面描述以预防事故，现有方法存在任务干扰问题。

Method: 采用双模型框架，VideoLLaMA专门负责captioning任务，Qwen2.5-VL专门负责视觉问答任务，通过任务特定优化发挥各自优势。

Result: VideoLLaMA在时间推理上表现优异(CIDEr=1.1001)，Qwen2.5-VL在视觉理解上表现突出(VQA准确率60.80%)，在AI City Challenge Track 2中获得S2分数45.7572，排名第10。

Abstract: Traffic safety analysis requires complex video understanding to capture
fine-grained behavioral patterns and generate comprehensive descriptions for
accident prevention. In this work, we present a unique dual-model framework
that strategically utilizes the complementary strengths of VideoLLaMA and
Qwen2.5-VL through task-specific optimization to address this issue. The core
insight behind our approach is that separating training for captioning and
visual question answering (VQA) tasks minimizes task interference and allows
each model to specialize more effectively. Experimental results demonstrate
that VideoLLaMA is particularly effective in temporal reasoning, achieving a
CIDEr score of 1.1001, while Qwen2.5-VL excels in visual understanding with a
VQA accuracy of 60.80\%. Through extensive experiments on the WTS dataset, our
method achieves an S2 score of 45.7572 in the 2025 AI City Challenge Track 2,
placing 10th on the challenge leaderboard. Ablation studies validate that our
separate training strategy outperforms joint training by 8.6\% in VQA accuracy
while maintaining captioning quality.

### [5] [PanoTPS-Net: Panoramic Room Layout Estimation via Thin Plate Spline Transformation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11992)
*Hatem Ibrahem,Ahmed Salem,Qinmin Vivian Hu,Guanghui Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PanoTPS-Net是一个从单张全景图像估计房间3D布局的新模型，结合CNN和薄板样条变换，能有效处理立方体和非立方体布局。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确估计房间3D布局在机器人、增强现实和室内设计中至关重要，需要能够处理各种形状房间布局的方法。

Method: 采用两阶段架构：CNN提取特征并学习TPS变换参数，然后TPS变换层将参考布局变形为目标布局。

Result: 在多个公开数据集上表现优异，3DIoU值在PanoContext、Stanford-2D3D、Matterport3DLayout和ZInD上分别达到85.49、86.16、81.76和91.98。

Conclusion: 该方法在房间布局估计中表现出高精度，证明了TPS变换与全景图像的兼容性，并能稳健处理各种形状的房间布局。

Abstract: Accurately estimating the 3D layout of rooms is a crucial task in computer
vision, with potential applications in robotics, augmented reality, and
interior design. This paper proposes a novel model, PanoTPS-Net, to estimate
room layout from a single panorama image. Leveraging a Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN) and incorporating a Thin Plate Spline (TPS) spatial
transformation, the architecture of PanoTPS-Net is divided into two stages:
First, a convolutional neural network extracts the high-level features from the
input images, allowing the network to learn the spatial parameters of the TPS
transformation. Second, the TPS spatial transformation layer is generated to
warp a reference layout to the required layout based on the predicted
parameters. This unique combination empowers the model to properly predict room
layouts while also generalizing effectively to both cuboid and non-cuboid
layouts. Extensive experiments on publicly available datasets and comparisons
with state-of-the-art methods demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
method. The results underscore the model's accuracy in room layout estimation
and emphasize the compatibility between the TPS transformation and panorama
images. The robustness of the model in handling both cuboid and non-cuboid room
layout estimation is evident with a 3DIoU value of 85.49, 86.16, 81.76, and
91.98 on PanoContext, Stanford-2D3D, Matterport3DLayout, and ZInD datasets,
respectively. The source code is available at:

*Tanner Muturi,Blessing Agyei Kyem,Joshua Kofi Asamoah,Neema Jakisa Owor,Richard Dyzinela,Andrews Danyo,Yaw Adu-Gyamfi,Armstrong Aboah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个专门的空间推理框架，通过在输入提示中嵌入边界框坐标来增强空间理解，在AI City Challenge Track 3中排名第4。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模3D环境中的空间推理存在挑战，现有模型依赖局部外观特征且缺乏显式空间基础，难以在仓库等复杂场景中泛化。

Method: 在输入提示中直接嵌入边界框坐标，让模型能够推理物体几何和布局；针对四个问题类别进行任务特定监督的微调；在训练集中为GPT响应添加标准化答案。

Result: 最终得分为73.0606，在公共排行榜上排名第4。

Conclusion: 结构化提示丰富和针对性优化能有效推进现实工业环境中的空间推理能力。

Abstract: Spatial reasoning in large-scale 3D environments such as warehouses remains a
significant challenge for vision-language systems due to scene clutter,
occlusions, and the need for precise spatial understanding. Existing models
often struggle with generalization in such settings, as they rely heavily on
local appearance and lack explicit spatial grounding. In this work, we
introduce a dedicated spatial reasoning framework for the Physical AI Spatial
Intelligence Warehouse dataset introduced in the Track 3 2025 AI City
Challenge. Our approach enhances spatial comprehension by embedding mask
dimensions in the form of bounding box coordinates directly into the input
prompts, enabling the model to reason over object geometry and layout. We
fine-tune the framework across four question categories namely: Distance
Estimation, Object Counting, Multi-choice Grounding, and Spatial Relation
Inference using task-specific supervision. To further improve consistency with
the evaluation system, normalized answers are appended to the GPT response
within the training set. Our comprehensive pipeline achieves a final score of
73.0606, placing 4th overall on the public leaderboard. These results
demonstrate the effectiveness of structured prompt enrichment and targeted
optimization in advancing spatial reasoning for real-world industrial
environments.

### [7] [Evaluating the Explainability of Vision Transformers in Medical Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12021)
*Leili Barekatain,Ben Glocker*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 评估不同Vision Transformer架构和预训练策略在医学影像中的可解释性，发现DINO结合Grad-CAM能提供最忠实和局部化的解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医学影像中，模型决策的可解释性直接影响临床信任和采用。Vision Transformers虽然性能优异，但其复杂的注意力机制给可解释性带来挑战。

Method: 使用Gradient Attention Rollout和Grad-CAM评估ViT、DeiT、DINO和Swin Transformer在不同预训练策略下的可解释性，在血液细胞分类和乳腺超声图像分类任务上进行定性和定量分析。

Result: DINO结合Grad-CAM在所有数据集中提供最忠实和局部化的解释。Grad-CAM始终产生类别区分性和空间精确的热图，而Gradient Attention Rollout产生更分散的激活。即使在误分类情况下，DINO与Grad-CAM也能突出显示误导模型的临床相关形态特征。

Conclusion: 通过提高模型透明度，这项研究支持将ViTs可靠且可解释地集成到关键的医学诊断工作流程中。

Abstract: Understanding model decisions is crucial in medical imaging, where
interpretability directly impacts clinical trust and adoption. Vision
Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in
diagnostic imaging; however, their complex attention mechanisms pose challenges
to explainability. This study evaluates the explainability of different Vision
Transformer architectures and pre-training strategies - ViT, DeiT, DINO, and
Swin Transformer - using Gradient Attention Rollout and Grad-CAM. We conduct
both quantitative and qualitative analyses on two medical imaging tasks:
peripheral blood cell classification and breast ultrasound image
classification. Our findings indicate that DINO combined with Grad-CAM offers
the most faithful and localized explanations across datasets. Grad-CAM
consistently produces class-discriminative and spatially precise heatmaps,
while Gradient Attention Rollout yields more scattered activations. Even in
misclassification cases, DINO with Grad-CAM highlights clinically relevant
morphological features that appear to have misled the model. By improving model
transparency, this research supports the reliable and explainable integration
of ViTs into critical medical diagnostic workflows.

### [8] [APGNet: Adaptive Prior-Guided for Underwater Camouflaged Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12056)
*Xinxin Huang,Han Sun,Junmin Cai,Ningzhong Liu,Huiyu Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: APGNet是一个用于水下伪装目标检测的自适应先验引导网络，通过Siamese架构和先验引导机制解决水下图像退化和海洋生物伪装问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下伪装目标检测面临两个关键挑战：水下图像退化（低对比度和颜色失真）和海洋生物的自然伪装。传统图像增强技术难以恢复退化图像的关键特征，而陆地场景的伪装目标检测方法缺乏对水下光学特性的考虑。

Method: 1. 使用MSRCR算法进行数据增强，生成光照不变图像以减轻退化影响；2. 设计扩展感受野模块和多尺度渐进解码器来捕获多尺度上下文信息；3. 提出自适应先验引导机制，在高级特征中嵌入空间注意力进行粗定位，在低级特征中使用可变形卷积细化轮廓。

Result: 在两个公共MAS数据集上的广泛实验表明，APGNet在常用评估指标下优于15种最先进的方法。

Conclusion: APGNet通过集成Siamese架构和自适应先验引导机制，有效解决了水下伪装目标检测中的图像退化和伪装问题，取得了优异的检测性能。

Abstract: Detecting camouflaged objects in underwater environments is crucial for
marine ecological research and resource exploration. However, existing methods
face two key challenges: underwater image degradation, including low contrast
and color distortion, and the natural camouflage of marine organisms.
Traditional image enhancement techniques struggle to restore critical features
in degraded images, while camouflaged object detection (COD) methods developed
for terrestrial scenes often fail to adapt to underwater environments due to
the lack of consideration for underwater optical characteristics.
  To address these issues, we propose APGNet, an Adaptive Prior-Guided Network,
which integrates a Siamese architecture with a novel prior-guided mechanism to
enhance robustness and detection accuracy. First, we employ the Multi-Scale
Retinex with Color Restoration (MSRCR) algorithm for data augmentation,
generating illumination-invariant images to mitigate degradation effects.
Second, we design an Extended Receptive Field (ERF) module combined with a
Multi-Scale Progressive Decoder (MPD) to capture multi-scale contextual
information and refine feature representations. Furthermore, we propose an
adaptive prior-guided mechanism that hierarchically fuses position and boundary
priors by embedding spatial attention in high-level features for coarse
localization and using deformable convolution to refine contours in low-level
features.
  Extensive experimental results on two public MAS datasets demonstrate that
our proposed method APGNet outperforms 15 state-of-art methods under widely
used evaluation metrics.

TL;DR: VidMP3是一个新的视频编辑方法，通过利用姿势和位置先验从源视频学习广义运动表示，能够在保持原始运动的同时实现结构和语义的灵活编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于扩散的视频编辑方法在结构保持任务上表现良好，但在结构可变编辑中存在时间不一致、主体身份漂移和需要人工干预等问题。

Method: 利用姿势和位置先验从源视频学习广义运动表示，生成保持原始运动但结构和语义灵活的新视频。

Result: 定性和定量评估均表明该方法优于现有方法。

Conclusion: VidMP3能够有效解决视频编辑中的运动保持问题，实现结构和语义的灵活编辑。

Abstract: Motion-preserved video editing is crucial for creators, particularly in
scenarios that demand flexibility in both the structure and semantics of
swapped objects. Despite its potential, this area remains underexplored.
Existing diffusion-based editing methods excel in structure-preserving tasks,
using dense guidance signals to ensure content integrity. While some recent
methods attempt to address structure-variable editing, they often suffer from
issues such as temporal inconsistency, subject identity drift, and the need for
human intervention. To address these challenges, we introduce VidMP3, a novel
approach that leverages pose and position priors to learn a generalized motion
representation from source videos. Our method enables the generation of new
videos that maintain the original motion while allowing for structural and
semantic flexibility. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate
the superiority of our approach over existing methods. The code will be made
publicly available at https://github.com/sandeep-sm/VidMP3.

Abstract: The major challenge in today's computer vision scenario is the availability
of good quality labeled data. In a field of study like image classification,
where data is of utmost importance, we need to find more reliable methods which
can overcome the scarcity of data to produce results comparable to previous
benchmark results. In most cases, obtaining labeled data is very difficult
because of the high cost of human labor and in some cases impossible. The
purpose of this paper is to discuss Domain Adaptation and various methods to
implement it. The main idea is to use a model trained on a particular dataset
to predict on data from a different domain of the same kind, for example - a
model trained on paintings of airplanes predicting on real images of airplanes

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have significantly improved audio-driven
human video generation, surpassing traditional methods in both quality and
controllability. However, existing approaches still face challenges in lip-sync
accuracy, temporal coherence for long video generation, and multi-character
animation. In this work, we propose a diffusion transformer (DiT)-based
framework for generating lifelike talking videos of arbitrary length, and
introduce a training-free method for multi-character audio-driven animation.
First, we employ a LoRA-based training strategy combined with a position shift
inference approach, which enables efficient long video generation while
preserving the capabilities of the foundation model. Moreover, we combine
partial parameter updates with reward feedback to enhance both lip
synchronization and natural body motion. Finally, we propose a training-free
approach, Mask Classifier-Free Guidance (Mask-CFG), for multi-character
animation, which requires no specialized datasets or model modifications and
supports audio-driven animation for three or more characters. Experimental
results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art
approaches, achieving high-quality, temporally coherent, and multi-character
audio-driven video generation in a simple, efficient, and cost-effective
manner.

### [13] [An Adaptive Edge-Guided Dual-Network Framework for Fast QR Code Motion Deblurring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12098)
*Jianping Li,Dongyang Guo,Wenjie Li,Wei Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对QR码去模糊的自适应双网络方法，包括用于严重模糊的EG-Restormer和用于轻度模糊的LENet，通过边缘引导注意力块显式利用QR码的结构先验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法很少显式利用QR码的高度结构化模式和锐利边缘先验，而QR码去模糊的关键目标是确保成功解码而非感知质量。

Method: 提出边缘引导注意力块(EGAB)将显式边缘先验嵌入Transformer架构，基于此开发EG-Restormer用于严重模糊；设计轻量级高效网络(LENet)用于轻度模糊；集成两者为自适应双网络(ADNet)根据模糊程度动态选择网络。

Result: 实验表明EG-Restormer和ADNet在严重模糊QR码的解码率上达到最先进性能，同时保持有竞争力的速度。

Conclusion: 该方法通过显式利用QR码的结构先验和自适应网络选择，有效提升了QR码去模糊的解码成功率，特别适合资源受限的移动设备。

Abstract: Unlike general image deblurring that prioritizes perceptual quality, QR code
deblurring focuses on ensuring successful decoding. QR codes are characterized
by highly structured patterns with sharp edges, a robust prior for restoration.
Yet existing deep learning methods rarely exploit these priors explicitly. To
address this gap, we propose the Edge-Guided Attention Block (EGAB), which
embeds explicit edge priors into a Transformer architecture. Based on EGAB, we
develop Edge-Guided Restormer (EG-Restormer), an effective network that
significantly boosts the decoding rate of severely blurred QR codes. For mildly
blurred inputs, we design the Lightweight and Efficient Network (LENet) for
fast deblurring. We further integrate these two networks into an Adaptive
Dual-network (ADNet), which dynamically selects the suitable network based on
input blur severity, making it ideal for resource-constrained mobile devices.
Extensive experiments show that our EG-Restormer and ADNet achieve
state-of-the-art performance with a competitive speed. Project page:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个利用生成先验进行3D场景重建的新方法，通过引入精确的几何监督来解决现有方法在观察区域和未观察区域的重建质量问题，以及多视角不一致性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于预训练扩散模型的3D场景重建方法存在两个关键限制：缺乏可靠的几何监督导致重建质量差，以及缺乏有效机制来缓解生成图像中的多视角不一致性，导致严重的形状-外观模糊和场景几何退化。

Method: 首先利用平面结构的普遍性来推导精确的度量尺度深度图，为观察和未观察区域提供可靠的监督。然后将这种几何指导整合到整个生成流程中，改进可见性掩码估计、指导新视角选择，并在使用视频扩散模型进行修复时增强多视角一致性。

Result: 在Replica、ScanNet++和DeepBlending数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法在几何和外观重建方面始终优于现有基线方法，特别是在未观察区域。同时支持单视图输入和无位姿视频，在室内和室外场景中具有良好的泛化能力和实际应用价值。

Conclusion: 准确的几何是有效利用生成模型增强3D场景重建的基本前提，该方法通过几何指导显著提高了重建质量和一致性，具有强大的泛化能力和实际应用前景。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in leveraging generative prior from pre-trained
diffusion models for 3D scene reconstruction, existing methods still face two
critical limitations. First, due to the lack of reliable geometric supervision,
they struggle to produce high-quality reconstructions even in observed regions,
let alone in unobserved areas. Second, they lack effective mechanisms to
mitigate multi-view inconsistencies in the generated images, leading to severe
shape-appearance ambiguities and degraded scene geometry. In this paper, we
identify accurate geometry as the fundamental prerequisite for effectively
exploiting generative models to enhance 3D scene reconstruction. We first
propose to leverage the prevalence of planar structures to derive accurate
metric-scale depth maps, providing reliable supervision in both observed and
unobserved regions. Furthermore, we incorporate this geometry guidance
throughout the generative pipeline to improve visibility mask estimation, guide
novel view selection, and enhance multi-view consistency when inpainting with
video diffusion models, resulting in accurate and consistent scene completion.
Extensive experiments on Replica, ScanNet++, and DeepBlending show that our
method consistently outperforms existing baselines in both geometry and
appearance reconstruction, particularly for unobserved regions. Moreover, our

### [15] [DRL: Discriminative Representation Learning with Parallel Adapters for Class Incremental Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12107)
*Jiawei Zhan,Jun Liu,Jinlong Peng,Xiaochen Chen,Bin-Bin Gao,Yong Liu,Chengjie Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个名为判别表示学习(DRL)的框架，通过增量并行适配器(IPA)网络和分离锚点监督(DAS)来解决非排练类增量学习中的三个核心挑战：模型复杂度增长、表示空间不连续变化以及阶段优化与全局推理不一致的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管预训练模型在非排练类增量学习中取得了显著进展，但仍面临三个关键挑战：模型复杂度不断增加、增量学习过程中表示空间的不连续变化，以及阶段优化与全局推理之间的不一致性。

Method: 1. 增量并行适配器(IPA)网络：基于预训练模型，在每个增量阶段学习轻量级适配器，通过传输门实现与当前模型的并行连接，确保表示能力的继承和传播。2. 分离锚点监督(DAS)：通过将正负样本分别与虚拟锚点进行比较来解耦约束，促进判别表示学习并对齐不同阶段的特征空间。

Result: 在六个基准测试上的广泛实验表明，DRL在整个类增量学习过程中始终优于其他最先进的方法，同时在训练和推理阶段都保持高效率。

Conclusion: DRL框架通过IPA网络和DAS机制有效解决了类增量学习中的关键挑战，实现了平滑的表示空间转移和阶段间特征对齐，在保持高效率的同时显著提升了性能。

Abstract: With the excellent representation capabilities of Pre-Trained Models (PTMs),
remarkable progress has been made in non-rehearsal Class-Incremental Learning
(CIL) research. However, it remains an extremely challenging task due to three
conundrums: increasingly large model complexity, non-smooth representation
shift during incremental learning and inconsistency between stage-wise
sub-problem optimization and global inference. In this work, we propose the
Discriminative Representation Learning (DRL) framework to specifically address
these challenges. To conduct incremental learning effectively and yet
efficiently, the DRL's network, called Incremental Parallel Adapter (IPA)
network, is built upon a PTM and increasingly augments the model by learning a
lightweight adapter with a small amount of parameter learning overhead in each
incremental stage. The adapter is responsible for adapting the model to new
classes, it can inherit and propagate the representation capability from the
current model through parallel connection between them by a transfer gate. As a
result, this design guarantees a smooth representation shift between different
incremental stages. Furthermore, to alleviate inconsistency and enable
comparable feature representations across incremental stages, we design the
Decoupled Anchor Supervision (DAS). It decouples constraints of positive and
negative samples by respectively comparing them with the virtual anchor. This
decoupling promotes discriminative representation learning and aligns the
feature spaces learned at different stages, thereby narrowing the gap between
stage-wise local optimization over a subset of data and global inference across
all classes. Extensive experiments on six benchmarks reveal that our DRL
consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art methods throughout the entire
CIL period while maintaining high efficiency in both training and inference
phases.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有预训练扩散引导方法依赖显式退化先验或全局统计指导，难以处理局部伪影或人脸颜色问题，需要更好的老照片人脸修复方案。

Method: 使用预训练扩散模型在弱指导下生成伪参考人脸，通过分阶段监督：结构指导应用于整个去噪过程，色彩细化在后期步骤进行，结合人脸解析图和划痕掩码选择性修复破损区域。

Result: 构建了包含300张真实老照片的VintageFace基准数据集，SSDiff在感知质量、保真度和区域可控性方面优于现有GAN和扩散方法。

Conclusion: SSDiff方法通过伪参考生成和选择性引导，有效解决了老照片人脸修复中的局部伪影和色彩问题，在真实老照片数据集上表现出色。

Abstract: Old-photo face restoration poses significant challenges due to compounded
degradations such as breakage, fading, and severe blur. Existing pre-trained
diffusion-guided methods either rely on explicit degradation priors or global
statistical guidance, which struggle with localized artifacts or face color. We
propose Self-Supervised Selective-Guided Diffusion (SSDiff), which leverages
pseudo-reference faces generated by a pre-trained diffusion model under weak
guidance. These pseudo-labels exhibit structurally aligned contours and natural
colors, enabling region-specific restoration via staged supervision: structural
guidance applied throughout the denoising process and color refinement in later
steps, aligned with the coarse-to-fine nature of diffusion. By incorporating
face parsing maps and scratch masks, our method selectively restores breakage
regions while avoiding identity mismatch. We further construct VintageFace, a
300-image benchmark of real old face photos with varying degradation levels.
SSDiff outperforms existing GAN-based and diffusion-based methods in perceptual
quality, fidelity, and regional controllability. Code link:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 检索增强图像生成系统的广泛采用引发了对未经授权使用私有图像数据集的担忧，传统数字水印方法在该系统中面临挑战。

Method: 利用视觉语言模型合成与原始数据集视觉一致的哨兵图像，通过随机生成的字符序列作为检索密钥进行保护验证。

Result: 实验结果表明ImageSentinel能有效检测未经授权的数据集使用，同时为授权应用保持生成质量。

Conclusion: ImageSentinel为解决RAIG系统中视觉数据集保护问题提供了一种有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The widespread adoption of Retrieval-Augmented Image Generation (RAIG) has
raised significant concerns about the unauthorized use of private image
datasets. While these systems have shown remarkable capabilities in enhancing
generation quality through reference images, protecting visual datasets from
unauthorized use in such systems remains a challenging problem. Traditional
digital watermarking approaches face limitations in RAIG systems, as the
complex feature extraction and recombination processes fail to preserve
watermark signals during generation. To address these challenges, we propose
ImageSentinel, a novel framework for protecting visual datasets in RAIG. Our
framework synthesizes sentinel images that maintain visual consistency with the
original dataset. These sentinels enable protection verification through
randomly generated character sequences that serve as retrieval keys. To ensure
seamless integration, we leverage vision-language models to generate the
sentinel images. Experimental results demonstrate that ImageSentinel
effectively detects unauthorized dataset usage while preserving generation
quality for authorized applications. Code is available at

Motivation: 单光子相机在飞行时间3D成像中面临硬件限制（如系统带宽、最大激光功率、传感器数据速率等）的挑战，现有压缩直方图方法在真实世界照明硬件约束下表现不佳。

Method: 采用约束优化方法，通过梯度下降联合优化照明和编码矩阵，确保编码函数符合硬件约束条件。

Result: 在广泛仿真中，该方法在带宽和峰值功率约束下始终优于传统编码设计，特别是在峰值功率受限系统中优势更为明显。

Conclusion: 该方法能够适应任意参数化脉冲响应，在具有非理想脉冲响应函数的真实世界系统中也表现良好。

Abstract: Single-photon cameras are becoming increasingly popular in time-of-flight 3D
imaging because they can time-tag individual photons with extreme resolution.
However, their performance is susceptible to hardware limitations, such as
system bandwidth, maximum laser power, sensor data rates, and in-sensor memory
and compute resources. Compressive histograms were recently introduced as a
solution to the challenge of data rates through an online in-sensor compression
of photon timestamp data. Although compressive histograms work within limited
in-sensor memory and computational resources, they underperform when subjected
to real-world illumination hardware constraints. To address this, we present a
constrained optimization approach for designing practical coding functions for
compressive single-photon 3D imaging. Using gradient descent, we jointly
optimize an illumination and coding matrix (i.e., the coding functions) that
adheres to hardware constraints. We show through extensive simulations that our
coding functions consistently outperform traditional coding designs under both
bandwidth and peak power constraints. This advantage is particularly pronounced
in systems constrained by peak power. Finally, we show that our approach adapts
to arbitrary parameterized impulse responses by evaluating it on a real-world
system with a non-ideal impulse response function.

Conclusion: CapFlow和MetaCaptioner为未来多模态研究提供了强大且成本效益高的视觉描述解决方案，有望推动该领域的发展。

Abstract: Generalist visual captioning goes beyond a simple appearance description
task, but requires integrating a series of visual cues into a caption and
handling various visual domains. In this task, current open-source models
present a large performance gap with commercial ones, which limits various
applications such as data synthesis. To bridge the gap, this paper proposes
CapFlow, a novel multi-agent collaboration workflow. CapFlow demonstrates for
the first time that, by capitalizing on open-source models, it is possible to
achieve caption quality on par with GPT-4.1 in various domains with an 89.5%
reduction in costs. By leveraging CapFlow as the data synthesizer, we produce
high-quality visual captions from image and video domains at scale, and obtain
a generalist visual captioner via fine-tuning, namely MetaCaptioner. Through
extensive experiments, we show that MetaCaptioner not only achieves comparable
captioning capabilities with commercial models but also reaches top-tier
multimodal performance in the open-source community. We hope CapFlow and
MetaCaptioner can benefit future multimodal research by providing a strong and
cost-effective visual captioning solution.

Result: 在RGB视频和毫米波雷达生理测量中均表现出优于现有技术的性能

Conclusion: FedHUG框架有效解决了联邦学习中无标签数据的领域泛化问题，为远程生理测量提供了可行的解决方案

Abstract: Remote physiological measurement gained wide attention, while it requires
collecting users' privacy-sensitive information, and existing contactless
measurements still rely on labeled client data. This presents challenges when
we want to further update real-world deployed models with numerous user data
lacking labels. To resolve these challenges, we instantiate a new protocol
called Federated Unsupervised Domain Generalization (FUDG) in this work.
Subsequently, the \textbf{Fed}erated \textbf{H}eterogeneous
\textbf{U}nsupervised \textbf{G}eneralization (\textbf{FedHUG}) framework is
proposed and consists of: (1) Minimal Bias Aggregation module dynamically
adjusts aggregation weights based on prior-driven bias evaluation to cope with
heterogeneous non-IID features from multiple domains. (2) The Global
Distribution-aware Learning Controller parameterizes the label distribution and
dynamically manipulates client-specific training strategies, thereby mitigating
the server-client label distribution skew and long-tail issue. The proposal
shows superior performance across state-of-the-art techniques in estimation
with either RGB video or mmWave radar. The code will be released.

Main category: cs.CV

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CTTA方法通过恢复初始模型或重用历史模型来减少灾难性遗忘，但通常伴随新知识学习不足和有害历史知识干扰，导致性能严重下降。

Method: 设计了域知识分裂(KFI)模块自适应地从配对类感知域提示池中分离新域知识，以及域知识融合(KFU)模块以最小成本将分裂的新知识合并到现有知识池中，采用贪心知识动态合并策略。

Result: 在ImageNet-C数据集上的广泛实验验证了所提方法相对于其他方法的有效性。

Conclusion: KFF方法通过类感知域知识融合与分裂机制，能够动态积累判别性历史知识，有效解决持续测试时适应中的知识遗忘和干扰问题。

Abstract: Continual Test-Time Adaptation (CTTA) aims to quickly fine-tune the model
during the test phase so that it can adapt to multiple unknown downstream
domain distributions without pre-acquiring downstream domain data. To this end,
existing advanced CTTA methods mainly reduce the catastrophic forgetting of
historical knowledge caused by irregular switching of downstream domain data by
restoring the initial model or reusing historical models. However, these
methods are usually accompanied by serious insufficient learning of new
knowledge and interference from potentially harmful historical knowledge,
resulting in severe performance degradation. To this end, we propose a
class-aware domain Knowledge Fusion and Fission method for continual test-time
adaptation, called KFF, which adaptively expands and merges class-aware domain
knowledge in old and new domains according to the test-time data from different
domains, where discriminative historical knowledge can be dynamically
accumulated. Specifically, considering the huge domain gap within streaming
data, a domain Knowledge FIssion (KFI) module is designed to adaptively
separate new domain knowledge from a paired class-aware domain prompt pool,
alleviating the impact of negative knowledge brought by old domains that are
distinct from the current domain. Besides, to avoid the cumulative computation
and storage overheads from continuously fissioning new knowledge, a domain
Knowledge FUsion (KFU) module is further designed to merge the fissioned new
knowledge into the existing knowledge pool with minimal cost, where a greedy
knowledge dynamic merging strategy is designed to improve the compatibility of
new and old knowledge while keeping the computational efficiency. Extensive
experiments on the ImageNet-C dataset verify the effectiveness of our proposed
method against other methods.

Motivation: 传统原型方法基于确定性平均，无法捕捉类内多样性，限制了在有限标注数据和显著解剖变异情况下的分割性能

Method: 提出扩散原型学习框架，包含扩散增强模块、空间感知条件机制和保守融合策略，在训练和推理阶段保持一致性

Result: 在腹部MRI和CT数据集上的实验显示显著性能提升，达到新的最先进水平

Conclusion: DPL通过概率建模和扩散增强有效解决了单样本医学图像分割中的原型表示挑战

Abstract: One-shot medical image segmentation faces fundamental challenges in prototype
representation due to limited annotated data and significant anatomical
variability across patients. Traditional prototype-based methods rely on
deterministic averaging of support features, creating brittle representations
that fail to capture intra-class diversity essential for robust generalization.
This work introduces Diffusion Prototype Learning (DPL), a novel framework that
reformulates prototype construction through diffusion-based feature space
exploration. DPL models one-shot prototypes as learnable probability
distributions, enabling controlled generation of diverse yet semantically
coherent prototype variants from minimal labeled data. The framework operates
through three core innovations: (1) a diffusion-based prototype enhancement
module that transforms single support prototypes into diverse variant sets via
forward-reverse diffusion processes, (2) a spatial-aware conditioning mechanism
that leverages geometric properties derived from prototype feature statistics,
and (3) a conservative fusion strategy that preserves prototype fidelity while
maximizing representational diversity. DPL ensures training-inference
consistency by using the same diffusion enhancement and fusion pipeline in both
phases. This process generates enhanced prototypes that serve as the final
representations for similarity calculations, while the diffusion process itself
acts as a regularizer. Extensive experiments on abdominal MRI and CT datasets
demonstrate significant improvements respectively, establishing new
state-of-the-art performance in one-shot medical image segmentation.

Motivation: 现有的预训练状态空间模型在视频分类中虽然效率高，但顺序压缩的视觉提示令牌无法有效捕捉视频的时空上下文信息，限制了空间和时间信息的有效传播。

Method: 设计了状态空间提示方法，包含帧内聚集模块来聚合每帧内的空间关键信息，以及帧间传播模块来在不同帧间传播判别性时空信息。

Result: 在四个视频基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法平均比现有SOTA方法提升了2.76%，同时减少了微调参数的开销。

Conclusion: 通过自适应平衡和压缩帧内和帧间的关键时空信息，该方法能够以互补的方式有效传播视频中的判别性信息。

Abstract: Recently, pre-trained state space models have shown great potential for video
classification, which sequentially compresses visual tokens in videos with
linear complexity, thereby improving the processing efficiency of video data
while maintaining high performance. To apply powerful pre-trained models to
downstream tasks, prompt learning is proposed to achieve efficient downstream
task adaptation with only a small number of fine-tuned parameters. However, the
sequentially compressed visual prompt tokens fail to capture the spatial and
temporal contextual information in the video, thus limiting the effective
propagation of spatial information within a video frame and temporal
information between frames in the state compression model and the extraction of
discriminative information. To tackle the above issue, we proposed a State
Space Prompting (SSP) method for video understanding, which combines
intra-frame and inter-frame prompts to aggregate and propagate key
spatiotemporal information in the video. Specifically, an Intra-Frame Gathering
(IFG) module is designed to aggregate spatial key information within each
frame. Besides, an Inter-Frame Spreading (IFS) module is designed to spread
discriminative spatio-temporal information across different frames. By
adaptively balancing and compressing key spatio-temporal information within and
between frames, our SSP effectively propagates discriminative information in
videos in a complementary manner. Extensive experiments on four video benchmark
datasets verify that our SSP significantly outperforms existing SOTA methods by
2.76% on average while reducing the overhead of fine-tuning parameters.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose UniGS, a unified map representation and

on 3D Gaussian Splatting. Our framework integrates a CUDA-accelerated
rasterization pipeline capable of rendering photo-realistic RGB images,
geometrically accurate depth maps, consistent surface normals, and semantic
logits simultaneously. We redesign the rasterization to render depth via
differentiable ray-ellipsoid intersection rather than using Gaussian centers,
enabling effective optimization of rotation and scale attribute through
analytic depth gradients. Furthermore, we derive the analytic gradient
formulation for surface normal rendering, ensuring geometric consistency among
reconstructed 3D scenes. To improve computational and storage efficiency, we
introduce a learnable attribute that enables differentiable pruning of
Gaussians with minimal contribution during training. Quantitative and
qualitative experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art reconstruction accuracy
across all modalities, validating the efficacy of our geometry-aware paradigm.

Conclusion: CoIRL-AD框架有效结合IL和RL优势，超越传统两阶段方法，提升自动驾驶系统性能

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving models trained solely with imitation learning
(IL) often suffer from poor generalization. In contrast, reinforcement learning
(RL) promotes exploration through reward maximization but faces challenges such
as sample inefficiency and unstable convergence. A natural solution is to
combine IL and RL. Moving beyond the conventional two-stage paradigm (IL
pretraining followed by RL fine-tuning), we propose CoIRL-AD, a competitive
dual-policy framework that enables IL and RL agents to interact during
training. CoIRL-AD introduces a competition-based mechanism that facilitates
knowledge exchange while preventing gradient conflicts. Experiments on the
nuScenes dataset show an 18% reduction in collision rate compared to baselines,
along with stronger generalization and improved performance on long-tail
scenarios. Code is available at: https://github.com/SEU-zxj/CoIRL-AD.

Conclusion: BEEP3D提供了一种高效且有效的端到端弱监督3D实例分割解决方案，通过师生框架和一致性损失成功解决了边界框标注的模糊性问题。

Abstract: 3D instance segmentation is crucial for understanding complex 3D
environments, yet fully supervised methods require dense point-level
annotations, resulting in substantial annotation costs and labor overhead. To
mitigate this, box-level annotations have been explored as a weaker but more
scalable form of supervision. However, box annotations inherently introduce
ambiguity in overlapping regions, making accurate point-to-instance assignment
challenging. Recent methods address this ambiguity by generating pseudo-masks
through training a dedicated pseudo-labeler in an additional training stage.
However, such two-stage pipelines often increase overall training time and
complexity, hinder end-to-end optimization. To overcome these challenges, we
propose BEEP3D-Box-supervised End-to-End Pseudo-mask generation for 3D instance
segmentation. BEEP3D adopts a student-teacher framework, where the teacher
model serves as a pseudo-labeler and is updated by the student model via an
Exponential Moving Average. To better guide the teacher model to generate
precise pseudo-masks, we introduce an instance center-based query refinement
that enhances position query localization and leverages features near instance
centers. Additionally, we design two novel losses-query consistency loss and
masked feature consistency loss-to align semantic and geometric signals between
predictions and pseudo-masks. Extensive experiments on ScanNetV2 and S3DIS
datasets demonstrate that BEEP3D achieves competitive or superior performance
compared to state-of-the-art weakly supervised methods while remaining
computationally efficient.

Conclusion: EReLiFM通过证据可靠性感知和残差流匹配有效解决了带噪声标签的开放集域泛化问题

Abstract: Open-Set Domain Generalization (OSDG) aims to enable deep learning models to
recognize unseen categories in new domains, which is crucial for real-world
applications. Label noise hinders open-set domain generalization by corrupting
source-domain knowledge, making it harder to recognize known classes and reject
unseen ones. While existing methods address OSDG under Noisy Labels (OSDG-NL)
using hyperbolic prototype-guided meta-learning, they struggle to bridge domain
gaps, especially with limited clean labeled data. In this paper, we propose
Evidential Reliability-Aware Residual Flow Meta-Learning (EReLiFM). We first
introduce an unsupervised two-stage evidential loss clustering method to
promote label reliability awareness. Then, we propose a residual flow matching
mechanism that models structured domain- and category-conditioned residuals,
enabling diverse and uncertainty-aware transfer paths beyond
interpolation-based augmentation. During this meta-learning process, the model
is optimized such that the update direction on the clean set maximizes the loss
decrease on the noisy set, using pseudo labels derived from the most confident
predicted class for supervision. Experimental results show that EReLiFM
outperforms existing methods on OSDG-NL, achieving state-of-the-art
performance. The source code is available at

significant attention as a solution to their high computational complexity,
making them more practical for real-world applications. In this regard, the
knowledge distillation (KD) approach has emerged as a promising alternative,
which transfers the rich visual and linguistic knowledge from a larger model
(teacher) to a smaller model (student). However, we observe that existing KD
methods struggle to effectively distill the teacher MLLM's rich visual
perception abilities to the student, a challenge that has been largely
overlooked in previous studies. Through a systematic analysis, we identify
visual attention misalignment between student and teacher as the main cause of
this issue. Based on this insight, we propose CompoDistill, a novel KD
framework that explicitly aligns the student's visual attention with that of
the teacher to enhance the student's visual perception abilities. Our extensive
experiments show that CompoDistill significantly improves performance on
compositional reasoning tasks that require visual perception abilities while
maintaining strong performance on visual question answering tasks, as done in
existing studies. Furthermore, CompoDistill demonstrates effectiveness with a
more advanced backbone, highlighting its generalizability.

Abstract: Recent advances in end-to-end (E2E) autonomous driving have been enabled by
training on diverse large-scale driving datasets, yet autonomous driving models
still struggle in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. The COOOL benchmark
targets this gap by encouraging hazard understanding beyond closed taxonomies,
and the 2COOOL challenge extends it to generating human-interpretable incident
reports. We present a hierarchical reasoning framework for incident report
generation from dashcam videos that integrates frame-level captioning, incident
frame detection, and fine-grained reasoning within vision-language models
(VLMs). We further improve factual accuracy and readability through model
ensembling and a Blind A/B Scoring selection protocol. On the official 2COOOL
open leaderboard, our method ranks 2nd among 29 teams and achieves the best
CIDEr-D score, producing accurate and coherent incident narratives. These
results indicate that hierarchical reasoning with VLMs is a promising direction
for accident analysis and for broader understanding of safety-critical traffic
events. The implementation and code are available at

Abstract: Recent advances in generative AI, particularly in computer vision (CV), offer
new opportunities to optimize workflows across industries, including logistics
and manufacturing. However, many AI applications are limited by a lack of
expertise and resources, which forces a reliance on general-purpose models.
Success with these models often requires domain-specific data for fine-tuning,
which can be costly and inefficient. Thus, using synthetic data for fine-tuning
is a popular, cost-effective alternative to gathering real-world data. This
work investigates the impact of synthetic data on the performance of object
detection models, compared to models trained on real-world data only,
specifically within the domain of warehouse logistics. To this end, we examined
the impact of synthetic data generated using the NVIDIA Omniverse Replicator
tool on the effectiveness of object detection models in real-world scenarios.
It comprises experiments focused on pallet detection in a warehouse setting,
utilizing both real and various synthetic dataset generation strategies. Our
findings provide valuable insights into the practical applications of synthetic
image data in computer vision, suggesting that a balanced integration of
synthetic and real data can lead to robust and efficient object detection
models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出DIANet双流框架，通过分别编码微表情的起始到顶点和顶点到结束两个阶段，利用交叉注意力融合模块整合特征，在多个基准数据集上优于传统单阶段方法。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微表情识别面临面部线索细微短暂、标注数据有限的挑战。传统动态图像方法忽略了微表情不同时间阶段的特征差异，需要更精细的时间建模。

Method: 使用相位感知动态图像：一个流编码起始到顶点阶段，另一个流捕获顶点到结束阶段。每个流由专用CNN处理，通过交叉注意力融合模块自适应整合特征。

Result: 在CASME-II、SAMM和MMEW三个基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法持续优于传统单阶段动态图像方法。

Conclusion: 明确建模时间相位信息对微表情识别至关重要，为推进该领域提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Micro-expressions are brief, involuntary facial movements that typically last
less than half a second and often reveal genuine emotions. Accurately
recognizing these subtle expressions is critical for applications in
psychology, security, and behavioral analysis. However, micro-expression
recognition (MER) remains a challenging task due to the subtle and transient
nature of facial cues and the limited availability of annotated data. While
dynamic image (DI) representations have been introduced to summarize temporal
motion into a single frame, conventional DI-based methods often overlook the
distinct characteristics of different temporal phases within a
micro-expression. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel
dual-stream framework, DIANet, which leverages phase-aware dynamic images - one
encoding the onset-to-apex phase and the other capturing the apex-to-offset
phase. Each stream is processed by a dedicated convolutional neural network,
and a cross-attention fusion module is employed to adaptively integrate
features from both streams based on their contextual relevance. Extensive
experiments conducted on three benchmark MER datasets (CASME-II, SAMM, and
MMEW) demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms
conventional single-phase DI-based approaches. The results highlight the
importance of modeling temporal phase information explicitly and suggest a
promising direction for advancing MER.

Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在推理任务上表现出色，但构建高效推理训练数据集的原则尚不明确，需要系统研究数据整理策略对模型性能的影响。

Method: 通过控制训练和评估设置，分析上下文来源的影响，实施针对性数据干预（如图像描述辅助信号、纯文本推理），并探索图像、问题和思维链解决方案的规模化扩展。

Result: 研究发现：上下文来源策略显著影响VLM性能；图像描述辅助信号和纯文本推理包含能带来显著提升；所有数据维度的扩展都能持续改善推理能力。基于此构建的HoneyBee数据集使3B参数模型在MathVerse上分别超越SOTA和基线模型7.8%和24.8%。

Conclusion: 本文提出了改进的视觉语言推理数据集整理策略，通过构建高质量的思维链推理数据集和测试时扩展策略，在显著降低解码成本的同时保持准确性，为VL推理数据集整理研究提供了有效方法。

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have made them highly
effective at reasoning tasks. However, the principles underlying the
construction of performant VL reasoning training datasets remain poorly
understood. In this work, we introduce several data curation approaches and
study their impacts on VL reasoning capabilities by carefully controlling
training and evaluation setups. We analyze the effects of context (image and
question pair) sources, implement targeted data interventions, and explore
scaling up images, questions, and chain-of-thought (CoT) solutions. Our
findings reveal that (a) context source strategies significantly affect VLM
performance, (b) interventions such as auxiliary signals from image captions
and the inclusion of text-only reasoning yield substantial gains, and (c)
scaling all data dimensions (e.g., unique questions per image and unique CoTs
per image-question pair) consistently improves reasoning capability. Motivated
by these insights, we introduce HoneyBee, a large-scale, high-quality CoT
reasoning dataset with 2.5M examples consisting 350K image-question pairs. VLMs
trained with HoneyBee outperform state-of-the-art models across model sizes.
For instance, a HoneyBee-trained VLM with 3B parameters outperforms the SOTA
model and the base model by 7.8% and 24.8%, respectively, on MathVerse.
Furthermore, we propose a test-time scaling strategy that reduces decoding cost
by 73% without sacrificing accuracy. Overall, this work presents improved
strategies for VL reasoning dataset curation research.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成模型的推理效率是商业化应用的关键挑战，并行token预测能大幅减少推理时间，但可能导致结构不一致问题，传统方法缺乏回溯修正机制。

Method: 采用新颖的训练方案，在上下文中注入随机token以提高鲁棒性，并在采样过程中实现token修正，保持并行token预测的效率优势。

Result: 在ImageNet-256、CIFAR-10图像生成和UCF-101、NuScenes视频生成任务上均取得显著改进。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持并行token预测效率的同时，显著提升了生成质量，适用于图像和视频生成两种模态。

Abstract: Recent advances in image and video generation have raised significant
interest from both academia and industry. A key challenge in this field is
improving inference efficiency, as model size and the number of inference steps
directly impact the commercial viability of generative models while also posing
fundamental scientific challenges. A promising direction involves combining
auto-regressive sequential token modeling with multi-token prediction per step,
reducing inference time by up to an order of magnitude. However, predicting
multiple tokens in parallel can introduce structural inconsistencies due to
token incompatibilities, as capturing complex joint dependencies during
training remains challenging. Traditionally, once tokens are sampled, there is
no mechanism to backtrack and refine erroneous predictions. We propose a method
for self-correcting image generation by iteratively refining sampled tokens. We
achieve this with a novel training scheme that injects random tokens in the
context, improving robustness and enabling token fixing during sampling. Our
method preserves the efficiency benefits of parallel token prediction while
significantly enhancing generation quality. We evaluate our approach on image
generation using the ImageNet-256 and CIFAR-10 datasets, as well as on video
generation with UCF-101 and NuScenes, demonstrating substantial improvements
across both modalities.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决红外小目标检测中存在的跨域偏移和异方差噪声扰动双重挑战，传统方法在真实场景中面临分布偏差限制。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：第一阶段使用小波引导跨域合成生成目标域对齐的训练样本；第二阶段引入真实域噪声不变性学习，构建动态噪声库并通过自监督损失学习噪声不变性。

Result: 实验结果表明该方法在多个定量指标上优于现有最先进方法，特别是在跨域场景中表现出优异的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: Ivan-ISTD框架有效解决了红外小目标检测中的跨域和噪声问题，创建了Dynamic-ISTD基准数据集，验证了方法的通用性。

Abstract: In the multimedia domain, Infrared Small Target Detection (ISTD) plays a
important role in drone-based multi-modality sensing. To address the dual
challenges of cross-domain shift and heteroscedastic noise perturbations in
ISTD, we propose a doubly wavelet-guided Invariance learning
framework(Ivan-ISTD). In the first stage, we generate training samples aligned
with the target domain using Wavelet-guided Cross-domain Synthesis. This
wavelet-guided alignment machine accurately separates the target background
through multi-frequency wavelet filtering. In the second stage, we introduce
Real-domain Noise Invariance Learning, which extracts real noise
characteristics from the target domain to build a dynamic noise library. The
model learns noise invariance through self-supervised loss, thereby overcoming
the limitations of distribution bias in traditional artificial noise modeling.
Finally, we create the Dynamic-ISTD Benchmark, a cross-domain dynamic
degradation dataset that simulates the distribution shifts encountered in
real-world applications. Additionally, we validate the versatility of our
method using other real-world datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that
our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of many
quantitative metrics. In particular, Ivan-ISTD demonstrates excellent
robustness in cross-domain scenarios. The code for this work can be found at:

TL;DR: 提出使用时空一致的代理节点来表示视频中动态变化的对象/场景，克服传统像素级匹配和跟踪的不稳定性问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频表示方法过度依赖不稳定且过于细粒度的运动和外观建模先验，像素级跟踪错误会导致视觉对象表示崩溃，特别是在遮挡和大运动情况下

Method: 使用分层代理节点稳定表达视觉对象的多尺度结构，通过动态表示更新机制利用视频时空先验，并采用形状和纹理表示的分离编码方式

Result: 实验表明该方法以更少参数实现高视频重建精度，支持视频修复和基于关键帧的时间一致性视频编辑等复杂任务

Conclusion: 代理节点表示能够有效处理跟踪误差、长期运动、遮挡和视角变化，提供可控的细粒度外观编辑能力

Abstract: Current video representations heavily rely on unstable and over-grained
priors for motion and appearance modelling, \emph{i.e.}, pixel-level matching
and tracking. A tracking error of just a few pixels would lead to the collapse
of the visual object representation, not to mention occlusions and large motion
frequently occurring in videos. To overcome the above mentioned vulnerability,
this work proposes spatio-temporally consistent proxy nodes to represent
dynamically changing objects/scenes in the video. On the one hand, the
hierarchical proxy nodes have the ability to stably express the multi-scale
structure of visual objects, so they are not affected by accumulated tracking
error, long-term motion, occlusion, and viewpoint variation. On the other hand,
the dynamic representation update mechanism of the proxy nodes adequately
leverages spatio-temporal priors of the video to mitigate the impact of
inaccurate trackers, thereby effectively handling drastic changes in scenes and
objects. Additionally, the decoupled encoding manner of the shape and texture
representations across different visual objects in the video facilitates
controllable and fine-grained appearance editing capability. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that the proposed representation achieves high video
reconstruction accuracy with fewer parameters and supports complex video
processing tasks, including video in-painting and keyframe-based temporally
consistent video editing.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了两种新的损失函数：乘法损失和置信度自适应乘法损失，用于医学和细胞图像的语义分割，在数据稀缺情况下优于传统的交叉熵和Dice损失组合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像面临数据稀缺问题（隐私、伦理、标注成本高），而广泛使用的交叉熵和Dice损失的加法组合对超参数敏感且在有限数据下表现不佳，需要更鲁棒高效的训练目标。

Method: 乘法损失将交叉熵和Dice损失相乘，基于预测置信度动态调节梯度；置信度自适应乘法损失进一步引入置信度驱动的指数缩放，整合预测概率和Dice系数来强调困难样本。

Result: 在细胞和医学分割基准测试中，该框架始终优于调优后的加法损失和现有损失函数，在极端数据稀缺情况下表现更好。

Conclusion: 该框架提供了一个简单、有效且无需超参数调整的机制，能够在具有挑战性的数据限制下实现鲁棒的分割性能。

Abstract: We propose two novel loss functions, Multiplicative Loss and
Confidence-Adaptive Multiplicative Loss, for semantic segmentation in medical
and cellular images. Although Cross Entropy and Dice Loss are widely used,
their additive combination is sensitive to hyperparameters and often performs
suboptimally, especially with limited data. Medical images suffer from data
scarcity due to privacy, ethics, and costly annotations, requiring robust and
efficient training objectives. Our Multiplicative Loss combines Cross Entropy
and Dice losses multiplicatively, dynamically modulating gradients based on
prediction confidence. This reduces penalties for confident correct predictions
and amplifies gradients for incorrect overconfident ones, stabilizing
optimization. Building on this, Confidence-Adaptive Multiplicative Loss applies
a confidence-driven exponential scaling inspired by Focal Loss, integrating
predicted probabilities and Dice coefficients to emphasize difficult samples.
This enhances learning under extreme data scarcity by strengthening gradients
when confidence is low. Experiments on cellular and medical segmentation
benchmarks show our framework consistently outperforms tuned additive and
existing loss functions, offering a simple, effective, and hyperparameter-free
mechanism for robust segmentation under challenging data limitations.

Motivation: 解决神经网络在OOD数据上产生过度自信预测的问题，避免传统方法需要收集辅助OOD数据集或生成伪OOD图像的高成本限制。

Method: 基于卷积局部不变性，从ID图像中提取背景特征作为模拟OOD视觉表示，通过优化减少这些背景特征的L2范数来训练神经网络。

Result: 在多个标准OOD检测基准测试中验证了方法的有效性，与现有后处理方法具有良好的组合兼容性，达到了新的最先进性能。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种有效且低成本的OOD检测解决方案，能够显著缓解神经网络对OOD数据的过度自信问题。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is crucial when deploying deep neural
networks in the real world to ensure the reliability and safety of their
applications. One main challenge in OOD detection is that neural network models
often produce overconfident predictions on OOD data. While some methods using
auxiliary OOD datasets or generating fake OOD images have shown promising OOD
detection performance, they are limited by the high costs of data collection
and training. In this study, we propose a novel and effective OOD detection
method that utilizes local background features as fake OOD features for model
training. Inspired by the observation that OOD images generally share similar
background regions with ID images, the background features are extracted from
ID images as simulated OOD visual representations during training based on the
local invariance of convolution. Through being optimized to reduce the
$L_2$-norm of these background features, the neural networks are able to
alleviate the overconfidence issue on OOD data. Extensive experiments on
multiple standard OOD detection benchmarks confirm the effectiveness of our
method and its wide combinatorial compatibility with existing post-hoc methods,
with new state-of-the-art performance achieved from our method.

Result: 在MSRS、RoadScene和M3FD公开数据集上的综合实验表明，AngularFuse明显优于现有主流方法，视觉对比证实了在挑战性场景中产生更清晰、更详细的结果。

Conclusion: AngularFuse通过创新的角度感知框架，成功解决了可见光-红外图像融合中的关键问题，在保持纹理强度和正确边缘方向方面表现出色，具有优越的融合能力。

Abstract: Visible-infrared image fusion is crucial in key applications such as
autonomous driving and nighttime surveillance. Its main goal is to integrate
multimodal information to produce enhanced images that are better suited for
downstream tasks. Although deep learning based fusion methods have made
significant progress, mainstream unsupervised approaches still face serious
challenges in practical applications. Existing methods mostly rely on manually
designed loss functions to guide the fusion process. However, these loss
functions have obvious limitations. On one hand, the reference images
constructed by existing methods often lack details and have uneven brightness.
On the other hand, the widely used gradient losses focus only on gradient
magnitude. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an angle-based
perception framework for spatial-sensitive image fusion (AngularFuse). At
first, we design a cross-modal complementary mask module to force the network
to learn complementary information between modalities. Then, a fine-grained
reference image synthesis strategy is introduced. By combining Laplacian edge
enhancement with adaptive histogram equalization, reference images with richer
details and more balanced brightness are generated. Last but not least, we
introduce an angle-aware loss, which for the first time constrains both
gradient magnitude and direction simultaneously in the gradient domain.
AngularFuse ensures that the fused images preserve both texture intensity and
correct edge orientation. Comprehensive experiments on the MSRS, RoadScene, and
M3FD public datasets show that AngularFuse outperforms existing mainstream
methods with clear margin. Visual comparisons further confirm that our method
produces sharper and more detailed results in challenging scenes, demonstrating
superior fusion capability.

Conclusion: SpineBench揭示了当前MLLMs在脊柱医学应用中的不足，为未来改进提供了指导方向，该基准已公开可用。

Abstract: With the increasing integration of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)
into the medical field, comprehensive evaluation of their performance in
various medical domains becomes critical. However, existing benchmarks
primarily assess general medical tasks, inadequately capturing performance in
nuanced areas like the spine, which relies heavily on visual input. To address
this, we introduce SpineBench, a comprehensive Visual Question Answering (VQA)
benchmark designed for fine-grained analysis and evaluation of MLLMs in the
spinal domain. SpineBench comprises 64,878 QA pairs from 40,263 spine images,
covering 11 spinal diseases through two critical clinical tasks: spinal disease
diagnosis and spinal lesion localization, both in multiple-choice format.
SpineBench is built by integrating and standardizing image-label pairs from
open-source spinal disease datasets, and samples challenging hard negative
options for each VQA pair based on visual similarity (similar but not the same
disease), simulating real-world challenging scenarios. We evaluate 12 leading
MLLMs on SpineBench. The results reveal that these models exhibit poor
performance in spinal tasks, highlighting limitations of current MLLM in the
spine domain and guiding future improvements in spinal medicine applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有动态3D城市场景重建方法在保真度和计算成本之间存在明显权衡，因其语义无关设计对所有场景元素分配相同资源

Method: 引入语义引导的修剪与正则化策略，使用混合重要性度量简化非关键元素；采用优先级驱动的渲染流水线，基于深度预传递剔除遮挡基元

Result: 在Waymo和KITTI数据集上，PAGS在安全关键对象上实现卓越重建质量，显著减少训练时间，渲染速度超过350 FPS

Conclusion: PAGS通过注入任务感知语义优先级，有效解决了动态3D重建中保真度与效率的权衡问题

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic 3D urban scenes is crucial for autonomous driving, yet
current methods face a stark trade-off between fidelity and computational cost.
This inefficiency stems from their semantically agnostic design, which
allocates resources uniformly, treating static backgrounds and safety-critical
objects with equal importance. To address this, we introduce Priority-Adaptive
Gaussian Splatting (PAGS), a framework that injects task-aware semantic
priorities directly into the 3D reconstruction and rendering pipeline. PAGS
introduces two core contributions: (1) Semantically-Guided Pruning and
Regularization strategy, which employs a hybrid importance metric to
aggressively simplify non-critical scene elements while preserving fine-grained
details on objects vital for navigation. (2) Priority-Driven Rendering
pipeline, which employs a priority-based depth pre-pass to aggressively cull
occluded primitives and accelerate the final shading computations. Extensive
experiments on the Waymo and KITTI datasets demonstrate that PAGS achieves
exceptional reconstruction quality, particularly on safety-critical objects,
while significantly reducing training time and boosting rendering speeds to
over 350 FPS.

TL;DR: 提出DL-DKD++框架，通过动态知识蒸馏从大规模视觉语言预训练模型向轻量级PRVR网络迁移知识，解决部分相关视频检索问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实际应用中视频通常未经修剪且包含复杂背景内容，而现有方法假设视频已修剪且仅包含文本相关内容，因此需要解决更实用的部分相关视频检索问题。

Method: 采用双学习框架，包含继承分支吸收教师模型的可迁移知识，探索分支学习PRVR数据集的任务特定信息，并引入动态软目标构建机制。

Result: 在TVR、ActivityNet和Charades-STA数据集上实现了最先进的PRVR性能。

Conclusion: 所提出的DL-DKD++框架能有效处理部分相关视频检索任务，通过知识蒸馏和动态软目标机制提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Almost all previous text-to-video retrieval works ideally assume that videos
are pre-trimmed with short durations containing solely text-related content.
However, in practice, videos are typically untrimmed in long durations with
much more complicated background content. Therefore, in this paper, we focus on
the more practical yet challenging task of Partially Relevant Video Retrieval
(PRVR), which aims to retrieve partially relevant untrimmed videos with the
given query. To tackle this task, we propose a novel framework that distills
generalization knowledge from a powerful large-scale vision-language
pre-trained model and transfers it to a lightweight, task-specific PRVR
network. Specifically, we introduce a Dual Learning framework with Dynamic
Knowledge Distillation (DL-DKD++), where a large teacher model provides
supervision to a compact dual-branch student network. The student model
comprises two branches: an inheritance branch that absorbs transferable
knowledge from the teacher, and an exploration branch that learns task-specific
information from the PRVR dataset to address domain gaps. To further enhance
learning, we incorporate a dynamic soft-target construction mechanism. By
replacing rigid hard-target supervision with adaptive soft targets that evolve
during training, our method enables the model to better capture the
fine-grained, partial relevance between videos and queries. Experiment results
demonstrate that our proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance on
TVR, ActivityNet, and Charades-STA datasets for PRVR. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究了视觉语言模型在logo识别中的幻觉问题，发现模型会生成品牌名称或文本内容，即使logo中不包含可见文字。通过系统测试和嵌入分析，揭示了模型依赖符号先验而非真实字形感知的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在多模态推理方面取得了显著进展，但容易产生幻觉，即输出结果没有基于视觉证据。本文特别关注logo幻觉这一被忽视的问题，即模型在logo不含可见文字时仍生成品牌名称或文本内容。

Method: 使用纯符号、混合和含文本logo的精选数据集，以及具有挑战性的Hard-60子集，系统测量领先VLMs的幻觉现象。通过九种结构化扰动测试鲁棒性，并对开源LLaVA进行嵌入级分析，识别与幻觉相关的投影器维度。

Result: 研究发现幻觉在强烈扭曲下仍然存在，遮挡暴露了最严重的弱点。嵌入分析显示幻觉与投影器的小部分维度相关，针对性消融显著减少错误同时保持OCR准确性。模型特别容易对标志性圆形logo产生幻觉。

Conclusion: VLMs往往依赖符号先验而非真实的字形感知，投影器子空间在这种失败模式中起决定性作用。研究为构建更可信的多模态系统提供了新的诊断视角和可行的缓解策略，包括投影器解耦和OCR引导解码。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have achieved impressive progress in multimodal
reasoning; yet, they remain vulnerable to hallucinations, where outputs are not
grounded in visual evidence. In this paper, we investigate a previously
overlooked setting: logo hallucination, where models generate brand names or
textual content despite logos containing no visible words. Using curated splits
of pure symbols, hybrids, and text-bearing logos, as well as the challenging
Hard-60 subset, we systematically measure hallucination across leading VLMs. We
further probe robustness through nine structured perturbations and show that
hallucinations persist even under strong distortions, with occlusion exposing
the sharpest weaknesses. Embedding-level analysis with open-weight LLaVA
demonstrates that hallucination is tied to a small subset of projector
dimensions, and targeted ablation substantially reduces errors while preserving
OCR accuracy. Together, these findings reveal that VLMs often rely on symbolic
priors rather than genuine glyph perception, particularly for iconic circular
logos, and that projector subspaces play a decisive role in this failure mode.
Our work contributes both a novel diagnostic lens and actionable mitigation
insights, highlighting projector disentanglement and OCR-guided decoding as
promising directions for building more trustworthy multimodal systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决街景场景中从训练轨迹的车辆中心帧生成不同轨迹（如不同车道或行驶方向）的新视角渲染问题。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：首先通过3D场景重建和渲染生成新视角，然后使用专用的单步扩散模型增强图像质量。

Result: 在公开测试排行榜上获得0.432的综合得分，总体排名第二。

Conclusion: 提出的混合方法在街景新视角合成任务中表现优异，验证了高斯泼溅与扩散模型结合的有效性。

Abstract: This paper describes the Qualcomm AI Research solution to the RealADSim-NVS
challenge, hosted at the RealADSim Workshop at ICCV 2025. The challenge
concerns novel view synthesis in street scenes, and participants are required
to generate, starting from car-centric frames captured during some training
traversals, renders of the same urban environment as viewed from a different
traversal (e.g. different street lane or car direction). Our solution is
inspired by hybrid methods in scene generation and generative simulators
merging gaussian splatting and diffusion models, and it is composed of two
stages: First, we fit a 3D reconstruction of the scene and render novel views
as seen from the target cameras. Then, we enhance the resulting frames with a
dedicated single-step diffusion model. We discuss specific choices made in the
initialization of gaussian primitives as well as the finetuning of the enhancer
model and its training data curation. We report the performance of our model
design and we ablate its components in terms of novel view quality as measured
by PSNR, SSIM and LPIPS. On the public leaderboard reporting test results, our
proposal reaches an aggregated score of 0.432, achieving the second place
overall.

TL;DR: CurriFlow是一个语义场景补全框架，通过光流时序对齐和课程学习深度融合，从单目图像推断完整的3D几何和语义信息，在SemanticKITTI基准上达到16.9 mIoU的SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SSC方法依赖时序堆叠或深度投影，缺乏显式运动推理，难以处理遮挡和噪声深度监督问题。

Method: 使用预训练光流进行多层级特征对齐，结合课程学习机制从稀疏LiDAR深度渐进过渡到密集立体深度，并利用SAM提供类别无关语义监督。

Result: 在SemanticKITTI基准上实现16.9 mIoU，达到最先进性能，验证了运动引导和课程感知设计的有效性。

Conclusion: CurriFlow通过光流时序对齐和课程深度融合，显著提升了基于相机的3D语义场景补全性能，为自动驾驶感知提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) aims to infer complete 3D geometry and
semantics from monocular images, serving as a crucial capability for
camera-based perception in autonomous driving. However, existing SSC methods
relying on temporal stacking or depth projection often lack explicit motion
reasoning and struggle with occlusions and noisy depth supervision. We propose
CurriFlow, a novel semantic occupancy prediction framework that integrates
optical flow-based temporal alignment with curriculum-guided depth fusion.
CurriFlow employs a multi-level fusion strategy to align segmentation, visual,
and depth features across frames using pre-trained optical flow, thereby
improving temporal consistency and dynamic object understanding. To enhance
geometric robustness, a curriculum learning mechanism progressively transitions
from sparse yet accurate LiDAR depth to dense but noisy stereo depth during
training, ensuring stable optimization and seamless adaptation to real-world
deployment. Furthermore, semantic priors from the Segment Anything Model (SAM)
provide category-agnostic supervision, strengthening voxel-level semantic
learning and spatial consistency. Experiments on the SemanticKITTI benchmark
demonstrate that CurriFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance with a mean
IoU of 16.9, validating the effectiveness of our motion-guided and
curriculum-aware design for camera-based 3D semantic scene completion.

TL;DR: 提出了一种可学习的自适应子采样框架，通过注意力引导的动态采样机制减少神经网络的计算复杂度，特别适用于3D医学影像和超声视频分类任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络性能提升往往伴随计算复杂度和成本增加，而3D体积或视频任务中存在固有冗余，并非所有切片或帧都必要。现有方法缺乏输入自适应性，采样机制在训练后保持静态。

Method: 提出注意力引导的采样模块，即使在推理阶段也能根据输入动态调整采样策略，解决了传统子采样不可微分的问题。

Result: 在MedMNIST3D医学影像数据集和两个超声视频数据集（包括真实临床条件下的内部数据集）上验证了方法的有效性，实现了性能提升和复杂度降低。

Conclusion: 该自适应子采样框架能够动态适应不同输入，在保持性能的同时显著减少计算复杂度，适用于实际临床应用。

Abstract: Although deep neural networks have provided impressive gains in performance,
these improvements often come at the cost of increased computational complexity
and expense. In many cases, such as 3D volume or video classification tasks,
not all slices or frames are necessary due to inherent redundancies. To address
this issue, we propose a novel learnable subsampling framework that can be
integrated into any neural network architecture. Subsampling, being a
nondifferentiable operation, poses significant challenges for direct adaptation
into deep learning models. While some works, have proposed solutions using the
Gumbel-max trick to overcome the problem of non-differentiability, they fall
short in a crucial aspect: they are only task-adaptive and not inputadaptive.
Once the sampling mechanism is learned, it remains static and does not adjust
to different inputs, making it unsuitable for real-world applications. To this
end, we propose an attention-guided sampling module that adapts to inputs even
during inference. This dynamic adaptation results in performance gains and
reduces complexity in deep neural network models. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method on 3D medical imaging datasets from MedMNIST3D as
well as two ultrasound video datasets for classification tasks, one of them
being a challenging in-house dataset collected under real-world clinical
conditions.

TL;DR: 提出了STORM-PSR双流框架，通过结合空间和时间特征来改进程序步骤识别，在物体部分遮挡时仍能准确识别步骤完成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅依赖单帧图像中的装配物体状态检测，忽略了时间特征，导致在物体部分遮挡时鲁棒性和准确性受限。

Method: 采用双流框架：装配状态检测流处理无遮挡视图，时空流通过空间编码器和基于Transformer的时间编码器捕获时空特征，即使在部分遮挡下也能识别步骤完成。

Result: 在MECCANO和IndustReal数据集上，相比先前方法将装配步骤完成的平均延迟分别降低了11.2%和26.1%。

Conclusion: 时空流不依赖无遮挡物体视图即可推断步骤完成，显著提升了程序步骤识别的性能。

Abstract: Procedure step recognition (PSR) aims to identify all correctly completed
steps and their sequential order in videos of procedural tasks. The existing
state-of-the-art models rely solely on detecting assembly object states in
individual video frames. By neglecting temporal features, model robustness and
accuracy are limited, especially when objects are partially occluded. To
overcome these limitations, we propose Spatio-Temporal Occlusion-Resilient
Modeling for Procedure Step Recognition (STORM-PSR), a dual-stream framework
for PSR that leverages both spatial and temporal features. The assembly state
detection stream operates effectively with unobstructed views of the object,
while the spatio-temporal stream captures both spatial and temporal features to
recognize step completions even under partial occlusion. This stream includes a
spatial encoder, pre-trained using a novel weakly supervised approach to
capture meaningful spatial representations, and a transformer-based temporal
encoder that learns how these spatial features relate over time. STORM-PSR is
evaluated on the MECCANO and IndustReal datasets, reducing the average delay
between actual and predicted assembly step completions by 11.2% and 26.1%,
respectively, compared to prior methods. We demonstrate that this reduction in
delay is driven by the spatio-temporal stream, which does not rely on
unobstructed views of the object to infer completed steps. The code for
STORM-PSR, along with the newly annotated MECCANO labels, is made publicly
available at https://timschoonbeek.github.io/stormpsr .

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的场景坐标回归模型在训练图像缺乏足够多视角约束时会退化，需要引入先验知识来提升模型性能。

Method: 将SCR模型训练重新解释为概率问题，注入从简单深度分布先验到基于大规模室内扫描训练的3D点云扩散模型等多种先验，在每一步训练中推动预测的3D场景点向合理几何形状靠拢。

Result: 在三个室内数据集上，所提先验方法帮助学习到更好的场景表示，产生更一致的场景点云、更高的配准率和更好的相机位姿，对下游任务如新视角合成和相机重定位有积极影响。

Conclusion: 通过概率重解释和注入高级重建先验，能够有效提升场景坐标回归模型的性能，特别是在多视角约束不足的情况下。

Abstract: Scene coordinate regression (SCR) models have proven to be powerful implicit
scene representations for 3D vision, enabling visual relocalization and
structure-from-motion. SCR models are trained specifically for one scene. If
training images imply insufficient multi-view constraints SCR models
degenerate. We present a probabilistic reinterpretation of training SCR models,
which allows us to infuse high-level reconstruction priors. We investigate
multiple such priors, ranging from simple priors over the distribution of
reconstructed depth values to learned priors over plausible scene coordinate
configurations. For the latter, we train a 3D point cloud diffusion model on a
large corpus of indoor scans. Our priors push predicted 3D scene points towards
plausible geometry at each training step to increase their likelihood. On three
indoor datasets our priors help learning better scene representations,
resulting in more coherent scene point clouds, higher registration rates and
better camera poses, with a positive effect on down-stream tasks such as novel
view synthesis and camera relocalization.

Motivation: 当前城市基础设施监测主要依赖物联网传感器和人工检查，成本高、难以扩展，且与市民通过视觉观察形成的感知不一致。研究探索机器是否能像市民一样"看到"并推断城市基础设施状况。

Method: 采用PRISMA方法论，分析了2021-2025年间发表的32篇同行评审研究，重点关注零样本应用。

Result: 研究发现视觉语言模型在城市监测中展现出潜力，能够处理复杂的视觉信息并与自然语言推理相结合。

Conclusion: 视觉语言模型是解决城市监测挑战的有前景技术，特别是在零样本应用方面表现出色。

Abstract: Urban monitoring of public infrastructure (such as waste bins, road signs,
vegetation, sidewalks, and construction sites) poses significant challenges due
to the diversity of objects, environments, and contextual conditions involved.
Current state-of-the-art approaches typically rely on a combination of IoT
sensors and manual inspections, which are costly, difficult to scale, and often
misaligned with citizens' perception formed through direct visual observation.
This raises a critical question: Can machines now "see" like citizens and infer
informed opinions about the condition of urban infrastructure? Vision-Language
Models (VLMs), which integrate visual understanding with natural language
reasoning, have recently demonstrated impressive capabilities in processing
complex visual information, turning them into a promising technology to address
this challenge. This systematic review investigates the role of VLMs in urban
monitoring, with particular emphasis on zero-shot applications. Following the
PRISMA methodology, we analyzed 32 peer-reviewed studies published between 2021
and 2025 to address four core research questions: (1) What urban monitoring
tasks have been effectively addressed using VLMs? (2) Which VLM architectures
and frameworks are most commonly used and demonstrate superior performance? (3)
What datasets and resources support this emerging field? (4) How are VLM-based
applications evaluated, and what performance levels have been reported?

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于条件流匹配(CFM)的图像质量传递框架，用于从低场MRI重建高场质量的MRI图像，在减少参数量的同时实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低场磁共振成像(LF-MRI)虽然价格低廉且便携，但信噪比低、诊断质量差，需要一种能够弥补质量差距而无需昂贵基础设施的方法。

Method: 使用条件流匹配(CFM)框架，通过直接回归最优速度场来学习噪声分布与目标数据分布之间的连续流，避免了传统生成模型的迭代采样或对抗性目标。

Result: CFM不仅实现了最先进的性能，而且在分布内和分布外数据上都表现出强大的泛化能力，同时使用的参数比竞争性深度学习方法显著减少。

Conclusion: CFM作为一种强大且可扩展的工具，在MRI重建中具有巨大潜力，特别是在资源有限的临床环境中。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel framework for image quality transfer based on
conditional flow matching (CFM). Unlike conventional generative models that
rely on iterative sampling or adversarial objectives, CFM learns a continuous
flow between a noise distribution and target data distributions through the
direct regression of an optimal velocity field. We evaluate this approach in
the context of low-field magnetic resonance imaging (LF-MRI), a rapidly
emerging modality that offers affordable and portable scanning but suffers from
inherently low signal-to-noise ratio and reduced diagnostic quality. Our
framework is designed to reconstruct high-field-like MR images from their
corresponding low-field inputs, thereby bridging the quality gap without
requiring expensive infrastructure. Experiments demonstrate that CFM not only
achieves state-of-the-art performance, but also generalizes robustly to both
in-distribution and out-of-distribution data. Importantly, it does so while
utilizing significantly fewer parameters than competing deep learning methods.
These results underline the potential of CFM as a powerful and scalable tool
for MRI reconstruction, particularly in resource-limited clinical environments.

TL;DR: VideoLucy是一个基于深度记忆回溯的长视频理解框架，通过分层记忆结构和迭代回溯机制解决现有方法在时间上下文理解和关键信息保留方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的代理系统在长视频理解中存在两个主要问题：1）在单帧上进行建模和推理，难以捕捉连续帧的时间上下文；2）稀疏帧采样可能丢失关键信息。

Method: 采用分层记忆结构，从粗到细定义不同层次的记忆细节和时间范围，通过基于代理的迭代回溯机制系统挖掘视频范围内的深层记忆。

Result: 在多个长视频理解基准测试中显著优于现有最先进方法，性能甚至超过GPT-4o等专有模型。

Conclusion: VideoLucy框架通过深度记忆回溯有效解决了长视频理解中的时间上下文和关键信息保留问题，同时提出了新的评估基准EgoMem。

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that agent-based systems leveraging large language
models (LLMs) for key information retrieval and integration have emerged as a
promising approach for long video understanding. However, these systems face
two major challenges. First, they typically perform modeling and reasoning on
individual frames, struggling to capture the temporal context of consecutive
frames. Second, to reduce the cost of dense frame-level captioning, they adopt
sparse frame sampling, which risks discarding crucial information. To overcome
these limitations, we propose VideoLucy, a deep memory backtracking framework
for long video understanding. Inspired by the human recollection process from
coarse to fine, VideoLucy employs a hierarchical memory structure with
progressive granularity. This structure explicitly defines the detail level and
temporal scope of memory at different hierarchical depths. Through an
agent-based iterative backtracking mechanism, VideoLucy systematically mines
video-wide, question-relevant deep memories until sufficient information is
gathered to provide a confident answer. This design enables effective temporal
understanding of consecutive frames while preserving critical details. In
addition, we introduce EgoMem, a new benchmark for long video understanding.
EgoMem is designed to comprehensively evaluate a model's ability to understand
complex events that unfold over time and capture fine-grained details in
extremely long videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of
VideoLucy. Built on open-source models, VideoLucy significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods on multiple long video understanding benchmarks,
achieving performance even surpassing the latest proprietary models such as
GPT-4o. Our code and dataset will be made publicly at

Abstract: Chest Xray imaging is a widely used diagnostic tool in modern medicine, and
its high utilization creates substantial workloads for radiologists. To
alleviate this burden, vision language models are increasingly applied to
automate Chest Xray radiology report generation (CXRRRG), aiming for clinically
accurate descriptions while reducing manual effort. Conventional approaches,
however, typically rely on single images, failing to capture the longitudinal
context necessary for producing clinically faithful comparison statements.
Recently, growing attention has been directed toward incorporating longitudinal
data into CXR RRG, enabling models to leverage historical studies in ways that
mirror radiologists diagnostic workflows. Nevertheless, existing surveys
primarily address single image CXRRRG and offer limited guidance for
longitudinal settings, leaving researchers without a systematic framework for
model design. To address this gap, this survey provides the first comprehensive
review of longitudinal radiology report generation (LRRG). Specifically, we
examine dataset construction strategies, report generation architectures
alongside longitudinally tailored designs, and evaluation protocols
encompassing both longitudinal specific measures and widely used benchmarks. We
further summarize LRRG methods performance, alongside analyses of different
ablation studies, which collectively highlight the critical role of
longitudinal information and architectural design choices in improving model
performance. Finally, we summarize five major limitations of current research
and outline promising directions for future development, aiming to lay a
foundation for advancing this emerging field.

Method: 第一阶段使用双流攻击模块：MNTD-PGD优化小扰动预算的梯度计算，SG-PGD聚焦视觉显著区域的扰动；第二阶段使用度量感知选择模块，基于攻击成功率和结构相似性评估候选样本。

Result: 与最先进攻击方法相比，MS-GAGA在未见检测器上实现了高达27%的更高误分类率。

Conclusion: MS-GAGA通过联合优化可转移性和不可察觉性，有效提升了黑盒设置下对抗攻击的性能。

Abstract: We present MS-GAGA (Metric-Selective Guided Adversarial Generation Attack), a
two-stage framework for crafting transferable and visually imperceptible
adversarial examples against deepfake detectors in black-box settings. In Stage
1, a dual-stream attack module generates adversarial candidates: MNTD-PGD
applies enhanced gradient calculations optimized for small perturbation
budgets, while SG-PGD focuses perturbations on visually salient regions. This
complementary design expands the adversarial search space and improves
transferability across unseen models. In Stage 2, a metric-aware selection
module evaluates candidates based on both their success against black-box
models and their structural similarity (SSIM) to the original image. By jointly
optimizing transferability and imperceptibility, MS-GAGA achieves up to 27%
higher misclassification rates on unseen detectors compared to state-of-the-art
attacks.

Abstract: Deep learning relies heavily on data augmentation to mitigate limited data,
especially in medical imaging. Recent multimodal learning integrates text and
images for segmentation, known as referring or text-guided image segmentation.
However, common augmentations like rotation and flipping disrupt spatial
alignment between image and text, weakening performance. To address this, we
propose an early fusion framework that combines text and visual features before
augmentation, preserving spatial consistency. We also design a lightweight
generator that projects text embeddings into visual space, bridging semantic
gaps. Visualization of generated pseudo-images shows accurate region
localization. Our method is evaluated on three medical imaging tasks and four
segmentation frameworks, achieving state-of-the-art results. Code is publicly

Conclusion: BSGS框架能够有效解决运动模糊图像中的3D场景重建问题，在去模糊性能上优于现有方法。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting has exhibited remarkable capabilities in 3D scene
reconstruction.However, reconstructing high-quality 3D scenes from
motion-blurred images caused by camera motion poses a significant challenge.The
performance of existing 3DGS-based deblurring methods are limited due to their
inherent mechanisms, such as extreme dependence on the accuracy of camera poses
and inability to effectively control erroneous Gaussian primitives
densification caused by motion blur.To solve these problems, we introduce a
novel framework, Bi-Stage 3D Gaussian Splatting, to accurately reconstruct 3D
scenes from motion-blurred images.BSGS contains two stages. First, Camera Pose
Refinement roughly optimizes camera poses to reduce motion-induced distortions.
Second, with fixed rough camera poses, Global RigidTransformation further
corrects motion-induced blur distortions.To alleviate multi-subframe gradient
conflicts, we propose a subframe gradient aggregation strategy to optimize both
stages.Furthermore, a space-time bi-stage optimization strategy is introduced
to dynamically adjust primitive densification thresholds and prevent premature
noisy Gaussian generation in blurred regions. Comprehensive experiments verify
the effectiveness of our proposed deblurring method and show its superiority
over the state of the arts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经方法学习UDF时存在数值不稳定、计算成本高和可控性有限的问题，需要更稳定高效的解决方案。

Method: 使用Voronoi几何准则为输入点分配双向法向量，通过能量函数优化对齐，然后扩散形成近似UDF梯度场，最后积分得到UDF。

Result: VAD能够稳健处理水密和开放表面，以及复杂的非流形和非定向几何结构，同时保持计算效率和稳定性。

Conclusion: VAD提供了一种计算高效且稳定的UDF计算方法，适用于各种复杂几何拓扑结构。

Abstract: Unsigned Distance Fields (UDFs) provide a flexible representation for 3D
shapes with arbitrary topology, including open and closed surfaces, orientable
and non-orientable geometries, and non-manifold structures. While recent neural
approaches have shown promise in learning UDFs, they often suffer from
numerical instability, high computational cost, and limited controllability. We
present a lightweight, network-free method, Voronoi-Assisted Diffusion (VAD),
for computing UDFs directly from unoriented point clouds. Our approach begins
by assigning bi-directional normals to input points, guided by two
Voronoi-based geometric criteria encoded in an energy function for optimal
alignment. The aligned normals are then diffused to form an approximate UDF
gradient field, which is subsequently integrated to recover the final UDF.
Experiments demonstrate that VAD robustly handles watertight and open surfaces,
as well as complex non-manifold and non-orientable geometries, while remaining
computationally efficient and stable.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于分数扩散模型的简单有效方法，仅通过特征空间归一化和分析推导的L2分数匹配损失权重，就能在无条件人体运动生成任务上达到最先进水平，同时直接生成运动和形状。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的人体运动生成方法依赖过度参数化的输入特征和辅助损失来改善结果，但这些策略对于扩散模型来说并非必需。本文旨在证明通过精心设计的特征归一化和损失权重，扩散模型就能有效匹配人体运动分布。

Method: 使用基于分数的扩散模型，仅采用特征空间归一化和分析推导的L2分数匹配损失权重，直接生成运动和形状，避免缓慢的关节后处理形状恢复。

Result: 在无条件人体运动生成任务上达到了与最先进方法相当的结果，同时避免了复杂的后处理步骤。

Conclusion: 通过理论驱动的组件设计和针对性消融实验，证明了所提方法的有效性，为人体运动生成提供了更简洁高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent work has explored a range of model families for human motion
generation, including Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), Generative Adversarial
Networks (GANs), and diffusion-based models. Despite their differences, many
methods rely on over-parameterized input features and auxiliary losses to
improve empirical results. These strategies should not be strictly necessary
for diffusion models to match the human motion distribution. We show that on
par with state-of-the-art results in unconditional human motion generation are
achievable with a score-based diffusion model using only careful feature-space
normalization and analytically derived weightings for the standard L2
score-matching loss, while generating both motion and shape directly, thereby
avoiding slow post hoc shape recovery from joints. We build the method step by
step, with a clear theoretical motivation for each component, and provide
targeted ablations demonstrating the effectiveness of each proposed addition in
isolation.

*Tianhao Li,Tingfa Xu,Ying Wang,Haolin Qin,Xu Lin,Jianan Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了首个无人机多光谱多目标跟踪基准MMOT，包含125个视频序列和48.8万标注，并开发了光谱特征提取和方向感知跟踪方案，显著提升了小目标和密集场景的跟踪性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RGB跟踪算法在无人机视角下依赖空间外观线索（颜色、纹理）容易失效，而多光谱图像提供的光谱反射率特征能增强目标区分能力，但缺乏专门的多光谱无人机数据集阻碍了该领域发展。

Method: 构建大规模多光谱无人机数据集MMOT，并提出多光谱和方向感知的MOT方案：轻量级光谱3D-Stem集成光谱特征，方向感知卡尔曼滤波器进行精确状态估计，端到端方向自适应transformer。

Result: 广泛实验表明，多光谱输入相比RGB基线显著提升了跟踪性能，特别是对小目标和密集物体效果更明显。

Conclusion: 这项工作将推动无人机多光谱多目标跟踪研究的发展，MMOT数据集、代码和基准测试已公开。

Abstract: Drone-based multi-object tracking is essential yet highly challenging due to
small targets, severe occlusions, and cluttered backgrounds. Existing RGB-based
tracking algorithms heavily depend on spatial appearance cues such as color and
texture, which often degrade in aerial views, compromising reliability.
Multispectral imagery, capturing pixel-level spectral reflectance, provides
crucial cues that enhance object discriminability under degraded spatial
conditions. However, the lack of dedicated multispectral UAV datasets has
hindered progress in this domain. To bridge this gap, we introduce MMOT, the
first challenging benchmark for drone-based multispectral multi-object
tracking. It features three key characteristics: (i) Large Scale - 125 video
sequences with over 488.8K annotations across eight categories; (ii)
Comprehensive Challenges - covering diverse conditions such as extreme small
targets, high-density scenarios, severe occlusions, and complex motion; and
(iii) Precise Oriented Annotations - enabling accurate localization and reduced
ambiguity under aerial perspectives. To better extract spectral features and
leverage oriented annotations, we further present a multispectral and
orientation-aware MOT scheme adapting existing methods, featuring: (i) a
lightweight Spectral 3D-Stem integrating spectral features while preserving
compatibility with RGB pretraining; (ii) an orientation-aware Kalman filter for
precise state estimation; and (iii) an end-to-end orientation-adaptive
transformer. Extensive experiments across representative trackers consistently
show that multispectral input markedly improves tracking performance over RGB
baselines, particularly for small and densely packed objects. We believe our
work will advance drone-based multispectral multi-object tracking research. Our
MMOT, code, and benchmarks are publicly available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Temporally Conditional Mamba模型，通过将条件信息整合到Mamba块的循环动态中，改进了基于时间相关输入信号的人类运动生成任务，显著提升了时间对齐、运动真实性和条件一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖交叉注意力机制融合条件与运动，但这种方法主要捕捉全局交互，难以保持逐步时间对齐。需要解决时间对齐问题以生成更准确反映时间模式的人类运动。

Method: 引入基于Mamba的Temporally Conditional Mamba模型，将条件信息整合到Mamba块的循环动态中，实现更好的时间对齐运动生成。

Result: 在各种人类运动任务上的广泛实验表明，该方法在时间对齐、运动真实性和条件一致性方面显著优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: Temporally Conditional Mamba通过改进条件信息整合机制，有效解决了人类运动生成中的时间对齐问题，为基于时间相关输入的运动生成任务提供了更好的解决方案。

Abstract: Learning human motion based on a time-dependent input signal presents a
challenging yet impactful task with various applications. The goal of this task
is to generate or estimate human movement that consistently reflects the
temporal patterns of conditioning inputs. Existing methods typically rely on
cross-attention mechanisms to fuse the condition with motion. However, this
approach primarily captures global interactions and struggles to maintain
step-by-step temporal alignment. To address this limitation, we introduce
Temporally Conditional Mamba, a new mamba-based model for human motion
generation. Our approach integrates conditional information into the recurrent
dynamics of the Mamba block, enabling better temporally aligned motion. To
validate the effectiveness of our method, we evaluate it on a variety of human
motion tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model significantly
improves temporal alignment, motion realism, and condition consistency over
state-of-the-art approaches. Our project page is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决农业图像分割中数据标注瓶颈问题，利用现有植物专用模型避免收集和标注新数据集的成本。

Method: 使用Plantnet的植物专用表示识别植物区域生成粗分割掩码，然后通过SAM进行精细分割。

Result: 在四个公开数据集上评估，Plantnet微调的DinoV2相比基础DinoV2模型在IoU指标上获得一致性能提升。

Conclusion: 结合基础模型和植物专用模型可以有效缓解标注瓶颈，在多样化农业场景中实现有效分割。

Abstract: We present a zero-shot segmentation approach for agricultural imagery that
leverages Plantnet, a large-scale plant classification model, in conjunction
with its DinoV2 backbone and the Segment Anything Model (SAM). Rather than
collecting and annotating new datasets, our method exploits Plantnet's
specialized plant representations to identify plant regions and produce coarse
segmentation masks. These masks are then refined by SAM to yield detailed
segmentations. We evaluate on four publicly available datasets of various
complexity in terms of contrast including some where the limited size of the
training data and complex field conditions often hinder purely supervised
methods. Our results show consistent performance gains when using
Plantnet-fine-tuned DinoV2 over the base DinoV2 model, as measured by the
Jaccard Index (IoU). These findings highlight the potential of combining
foundation models with specialized plant-centric models to alleviate the
annotation bottleneck and enable effective segmentation in diverse agricultural
scenarios.

*Yasaman Haghighi,Bastien van Delft,Mariam Hassan,Alexandre Alahi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LayerSync是一种领域无关的方法，通过使用扩散模型自身的中间表示作为内在指导来提升生成质量和训练效率，无需外部监督或预训练模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前研究表明扩散模型中间表示的质量与生成质量相关，外部指导能加速训练。本文重新思考这一范式，提出使用模型自身的语义丰富表示来指导较弱表示，减少对外部监督的需求。

Method: LayerSync是一种自给自足的即插即用正则化项，利用扩散模型各层表示质量差异，让语义最丰富的表示作为内在指导来正则化较弱表示，不增加训练开销。

Result: 在图像生成上广泛评估，并扩展到音频、视频和运动生成领域。显著提升训练效率（如Flow-based Transformer在ImageNet上训练加速8.75倍）和生成质量（提升23.6%）。

Conclusion: LayerSync是一种通用、高效的正则化方法，能一致提升扩散模型的生成质量和训练效率，且适用于多种模态，无需额外数据或预训练模型。

Abstract: We propose LayerSync, a domain-agnostic approach for improving the generation
quality and the training efficiency of diffusion models. Prior studies have
highlighted the connection between the quality of generation and the
representations learned by diffusion models, showing that external guidance on
model intermediate representations accelerates training. We reconceptualize
this paradigm by regularizing diffusion models with their own intermediate
representations. Building on the observation that representation quality varies
across diffusion model layers, we show that the most semantically rich
representations can act as an intrinsic guidance for weaker ones, reducing the
need for external supervision. Our approach, LayerSync, is a self-sufficient,
plug-and-play regularizer term with no overhead on diffusion model training and
generalizes beyond the visual domain to other modalities. LayerSync requires no
pretrained models nor additional data. We extensively evaluate the method on
image generation and demonstrate its applicability to other domains such as
audio, video, and motion generation. We show that it consistently improves the
generation quality and the training efficiency. For example, we speed up the
training of flow-based transformer by over 8.75x on ImageNet dataset and
improved the generation quality by 23.6%. The code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的两阶段训练框架，用于提升像素空间扩散模型和一致性模型的性能，显著缩小了与潜在空间模型的差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 像素空间生成模型通常比潜在空间模型更难训练且性能较差，存在持续的效率和性能差距。

Method: 两阶段训练框架：第一阶段预训练编码器捕获干净图像的语义信息并与确定性采样轨迹对齐；第二阶段将编码器与随机初始化解码器集成，对完整模型进行端到端微调。

Result: 在ImageNet-256上扩散模型达到FID 2.04，ImageNet-512上FID 2.35（75 NFE）；一致性模型在ImageNet-256上单步采样达到FID 8.82，显著超越潜在空间对应模型。

Conclusion: 该框架首次成功实现了无需预训练VAE或扩散模型的高分辨率图像一致性模型训练，在生成质量和效率方面大幅超越现有像素空间方法。

Abstract: Pixel-space generative models are often more difficult to train and generally
underperform compared to their latent-space counterparts, leaving a persistent
performance and efficiency gap. In this paper, we introduce a novel two-stage
training framework that closes this gap for pixel-space diffusion and
consistency models. In the first stage, we pre-train encoders to capture
meaningful semantics from clean images while aligning them with points along
the same deterministic sampling trajectory, which evolves points from the prior
to the data distribution. In the second stage, we integrate the encoder with a
randomly initialized decoder and fine-tune the complete model end-to-end for
both diffusion and consistency models. Our training framework demonstrates
strong empirical performance on ImageNet dataset. Specifically, our diffusion
model reaches an FID of 2.04 on ImageNet-256 and 2.35 on ImageNet-512 with 75
number of function evaluations (NFE), surpassing prior pixel-space methods by a
large margin in both generation quality and efficiency while rivaling leading
VAE-based models at comparable training cost. Furthermore, on ImageNet-256, our
consistency model achieves an impressive FID of 8.82 in a single sampling step,
significantly surpassing its latent-space counterpart. To the best of our
knowledge, this marks the first successful training of a consistency model
directly on high-resolution images without relying on pre-trained VAEs or
diffusion models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态推理方法依赖显式推理步骤，需要大量视觉-文本标注且引入显著推理延迟

Method: IVT-LR在潜在空间中注入视觉和文本信息，每个推理步骤由潜在文本（前一步隐藏状态）和潜在视觉（选定图像嵌入）组成，采用渐进式多阶段训练策略

Result: 在M3CoT和ScienceQA数据集上，平均准确率提升5.45%，推理速度提升5倍以上

Conclusion: IVT-LR方法有效解决了多模态推理中的标注成本和推理效率问题，实现了性能与效率的双重提升

Abstract: Multimodal reasoning aims to enhance the capabilities of MLLMs by
incorporating intermediate reasoning steps before reaching the final answer. It
has evolved from text-only reasoning to the integration of visual information,
enabling the thought process to be conveyed through both images and text.
Despite its effectiveness, current multimodal reasoning methods depend on
explicit reasoning steps that require labor-intensive vision-text annotations
and inherently introduce significant inference latency. To address these
issues, we introduce multimodal latent reasoning with the advantages of
multimodal representation, reduced annotation, and inference efficiency. To
facilicate it, we propose Interleaved Vision-Text Latent Reasoning (IVT-LR),
which injects both visual and textual information in the reasoning process
within the latent space. Specifically, IVT-LR represents each reasoning step by
combining two implicit parts: latent text (the hidden states from the previous
step) and latent vision (a set of selected image embeddings). We further
introduce a progressive multi-stage training strategy to enable MLLMs to
perform the above multimodal latent reasoning steps. Experiments on M3CoT and
ScienceQA demonstrate that our IVT-LR method achieves an average performance
increase of 5.45% in accuracy, while simultaneously achieving a speed increase
of over 5 times compared to existing approaches. Code available at

Method: 基于整流流的框架，将水下物理成像信息作为显式先验直接融入网络训练过程，并引入时间维度建模。

Result: 在USOD10K数据集上，WaterFlow在S_m指标上获得0.072的提升，证明了方法的有效性和优越性。

Conclusion: 通过将水下物理成像信息作为显式先验并结合时间维度建模，能够显著提升水下显著目标检测的性能。

Abstract: Underwater Salient Object Detection (USOD) faces significant challenges,
including underwater image quality degradation and domain gaps. Existing
methods tend to ignore the physical principles of underwater imaging or simply
treat degradation phenomena in underwater images as interference factors that
must be eliminated, failing to fully exploit the valuable information they
contain. We propose WaterFlow, a rectified flow-based framework for underwater
salient object detection that innovatively incorporates underwater physical
imaging information as explicit priors directly into the network training
process and introduces temporal dimension modeling, significantly enhancing the
model's capability for salient object identification. On the USOD10K dataset,
WaterFlow achieves a 0.072 gain in S_m, demonstrating the effectiveness and
superiority of our method. The code will be published after the acceptance.

Conclusion: ZSCFC方法能够有效解决真实世界去噪问题，无需噪声分布假设，具有高效和优越的性能表现。

Abstract: Zero-shot denoisers address the dataset dependency of deep-learning-based
denoisers, enabling the denoising of unseen single images. Nonetheless,
existing zero-shot methods suffer from long training times and rely on the
assumption of noise independence and a zero-mean property, limiting their
effectiveness in real-world denoising scenarios where noise characteristics are
more complicated. This paper proposes an efficient and effective method for
real-world denoising, the Zero-Shot denoiser based on Cross-Frequency
Consistency (ZSCFC), which enables training and denoising with a single noisy
image and does not rely on assumptions about noise distribution. Specifically,
image textures exhibit position similarity and content consistency across
different frequency bands, while noise does not. Based on this property, we
developed cross-frequency consistency loss and an ultralight network to realize
image denoising. Experiments on various real-world image datasets demonstrate
that our ZSCFC outperforms other state-of-the-art zero-shot methods in terms of
computational efficiency and denoising performance.

Motivation: 现有最先进的HMR方法依赖大型非分层视觉变换器作为编码器，计算成本高。本文旨在开发简单高效的模型，通过利用分层VFMs的早期阶段来平衡准确性和计算效率。

Method: 构建了三个轻量级HMR2.0变体，并提出了使用Swin Transformer、GroupMixFormer和VMamba等分层VFMs的前两到三个阶段作为编码器的设计。

Result: 评估了27个基于分层VFM的HMR和HPE模型，发现仅使用前两到三个阶段就能达到与完整阶段模型相当的性能，且在准确性和计算效率之间具有更好的权衡。

Conclusion: 分层VFMs的早期阶段可以作为高效编码器用于HMR和HPE任务，在保持性能的同时显著降低计算成本，优于现有的轻量级替代方案。

Abstract: In this work, we aim to develop simple and efficient models for human mesh
recovery (HMR) and its predecessor task, human pose estimation (HPE).
State-of-the-art HMR methods, such as HMR2.0 and its successors, rely on large,
non-hierarchical vision transformers as encoders, which are inherited from the
corresponding HPE models like ViTPose. To establish baselines across varying
computational budgets, we first construct three lightweight HMR2.0 variants by
adapting the corresponding ViTPose models. In addition, we propose leveraging
the early stages of hierarchical vision foundation models (VFMs), including
Swin Transformer, GroupMixFormer, and VMamba, as encoders. This design is
motivated by the observation that intermediate stages of hierarchical VFMs
produce feature maps with resolutions comparable to or higher than those of
non-hierarchical counterparts. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 27
hierarchical-VFM-based HMR and HPE models, demonstrating that using only the
first two or three stages achieves performance on par with full-stage models.
Moreover, we show that the resulting truncated models exhibit better trade-offs
between accuracy and computational efficiency compared to existing lightweight
alternatives.

Abstract: Earth observation (EO) satellites produce massive streams of multispectral
image time series, posing pressing challenges for storage and transmission.
Yet, learned EO compression remains fragmented, lacking publicly available
pretrained models and misaligned with advances in compression for natural
imagery. Image codecs overlook temporal redundancy, while video codecs rely on
motion priors that fail to capture the radiometric evolution of largely static
scenes. We introduce TerraCodec (TEC), a family of learned codecs tailored to
EO. TEC includes efficient image-based variants adapted to multispectral
inputs, as well as a Temporal Transformer model (TEC-TT) that leverages
dependencies across time. To overcome the fixed-rate setting of today's neural
codecs, we present Latent Repacking, a novel method for training flexible-rate
transformer models that operate on varying rate-distortion settings. Trained on
Sentinel-2 data, TerraCodec outperforms classical codecs, achieving 3-10x
stronger compression at equivalent image quality. Beyond compression, TEC-TT
enables zero-shot cloud inpainting, surpassing state-of-the-art methods on the
AllClear benchmark. Our results establish bespoke, learned compression
algorithms as a promising direction for Earth observation. Code and model
weights will be released under a permissive license.

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) swarm systems necessitate efficient
collaborative perception mechanisms for diverse operational scenarios. Current
Bird's Eye View (BEV)-based approaches exhibit two main limitations:
bounding-box representations fail to capture complete semantic and geometric
information of the scene, and their performance significantly degrades when
encountering undefined or occluded objects. To address these limitations, we
propose a novel multi-UAV collaborative occupancy prediction framework. Our
framework effectively preserves 3D spatial structures and semantics through
integrating a Spatial-Aware Feature Encoder and Cross-Agent Feature
Integration. To enhance efficiency, we further introduce Altitude-Aware Feature
Reduction to compactly represent scene information, along with a Dual-Mask
Perceptual Guidance mechanism to adaptively select features and reduce
communication overhead. Due to the absence of suitable benchmark datasets, we
extend three datasets for evaluation: two virtual datasets (Air-to-Pred-Occ and
UAV3D-Occ) and one real-world dataset (GauUScene-Occ). Experiments results
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, significantly
outperforming existing collaborative methods while reducing communication
overhead to only a fraction of previous approaches.

Conclusion: H-EGL框架通过结合自监督和人类引导约束，有效提升了医学影像分类的准确性和泛化能力，同时产生更符合人类认知的注意力图。

Abstract: Transformer-based deep learning models have demonstrated exceptional
performance in medical imaging by leveraging attention mechanisms for feature
representation and interpretability. However, these models are prone to
learning spurious correlations, leading to biases and limited generalization.
While human-AI attention alignment can mitigate these issues, it often depends
on costly manual supervision. In this work, we propose a Hybrid
Explanation-Guided Learning (H-EGL) framework that combines self-supervised and
human-guided constraints to enhance attention alignment and improve
generalization. The self-supervised component of H-EGL leverages
class-distinctive attention without relying on restrictive priors, promoting
robustness and flexibility. We validate our approach on chest X-ray
classification using the Vision Transformer (ViT), where H-EGL outperforms two
state-of-the-art Explanation-Guided Learning (EGL) methods, demonstrating
superior classification accuracy and generalization capability. Additionally,
it produces attention maps that are better aligned with human expertise.

Method: 构建包含1,204个开放视觉任务的IRIS基准，涵盖5个领域（603个单轮、601个多轮任务），配备详细评分标准进行系统评估。

Conclusion: IRIS基准为推进MLLMs视觉智能提供了关键见解，揭示了现有模型在"think with images"范式下的局限性。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are increasingly applied in
real-world scenarios where user-provided images are often imperfect, requiring
active image manipulations such as cropping, editing, or enhancement to uncover
salient visual cues. Beyond static visual perception, MLLMs must also think
with images: dynamically transforming visual content and integrating it with
other tools to solve complex tasks. However, this shift from treating vision as
passive context to a manipulable cognitive workspace remains underexplored.
Most existing benchmarks still follow a think about images paradigm, where
images are regarded as static inputs. To address this gap, we introduce IRIS,
an Interactive Reasoning with Images and Systems that evaluates MLLMs' ability
to perceive, transform, and reason across complex visual-textual tasks under
the think with images paradigm. IRIS comprises 1,204 challenging, open-ended
vision tasks (603 single-turn, 601 multi-turn) spanning across five diverse
domains, each paired with detailed rubrics to enable systematic evaluation. Our
evaluation shows that current MLLMs struggle with tasks requiring effective
integration of vision and general-purpose tools. Even the strongest model
(GPT-5-think) reaches only 18.68% pass rate. We further observe divergent
tool-use behaviors, with OpenAI models benefiting from diverse image
manipulations while Gemini-2.5-pro shows no improvement. By introducing the
first benchmark centered on think with images, IRIS offers critical insights
for advancing visual intelligence in MLLMs.

*Adam Tupper,Christian Gagné*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种新的个性化联邦微调方法，通过正交LoRA适配器分离通用知识和客户端特定知识，使每个客户端能够充分利用自身和其他客户端的数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基础模型在医疗AI中应用广泛，但需要针对特定任务进行微调。虽然基础模型减少了训练数据需求，但由于患者隐私保护限制，从不同来源获取足够数据仍然困难。联邦学习可以解决这个问题，但需要更好的个性化方法。

Method: 提出个性化联邦微调方法，学习正交LoRA适配器来解耦通用知识和客户端特定知识。每个客户端通过这种方法能够同时利用自身数据和其他客户端的数据。

Result: 在真实世界的联邦医学影像任务上的初步结果显示，该方法与当前联邦微调方法相比具有竞争力。

Conclusion: 该方法为医疗领域中的联邦学习提供了一种有效的个性化微调方案，能够在保护患者隐私的同时充分利用分布式数据。

Abstract: Foundation models open up new possibilities for the use of AI in healthcare.
However, even when pre-trained on health data, they still need to be fine-tuned
for specific downstream tasks. Furthermore, although foundation models reduce
the amount of training data required to achieve good performance, obtaining
sufficient data is still a challenge. This is due, in part, to restrictions on
sharing and aggregating data from different sources to protect patients'
privacy. One possible solution to this is to fine-tune foundation models via
federated learning across multiple participating clients (i.e., hospitals,
clinics, etc.). In this work, we propose a new personalized federated
fine-tuning method that learns orthogonal LoRA adapters to disentangle general
and client-specific knowledge, enabling each client to fully exploit both their
own data and the data of others. Our preliminary results on real-world
federated medical imaging tasks demonstrate that our approach is competitive
against current federated fine-tuning methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FlashVSR是首个基于扩散模型的实时视频超分辨率框架，通过三阶段蒸馏、局部约束稀疏注意力和微型条件解码器实现17 FPS的高效处理，在单A100 GPU上支持768x1408视频。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于扩散模型的视频超分辨率方法存在高延迟、计算量大和对超高分辨率泛化能力差的问题，需要开发高效、可扩展且实时的解决方案。

Method: 提出三阶段蒸馏管道实现流式超分辨率，采用局部约束稀疏注意力减少冗余计算，使用微型条件解码器加速重建，并构建了包含12万视频和18万图像的大规模数据集VSR-120K。

Result: FlashVSR在超高分辨率下可靠扩展，达到最先进性能，相比之前的一步扩散VSR模型速度提升高达12倍，在单A100 GPU上实现约17 FPS的处理速度。

Conclusion: FlashVSR使基于扩散模型的视频超分辨率变得实用，实现了效率、可扩展性和实时性能的平衡，将促进高效扩散VSR的未来研究。

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently advanced video restoration, but applying them
to real-world video super-resolution (VSR) remains challenging due to high
latency, prohibitive computation, and poor generalization to ultra-high
resolutions. Our goal in this work is to make diffusion-based VSR practical by
achieving efficiency, scalability, and real-time performance. To this end, we
propose FlashVSR, the first diffusion-based one-step streaming framework
towards real-time VSR. FlashVSR runs at approximately 17 FPS for 768x1408
videos on a single A100 GPU by combining three complementary innovations: (i) a
train-friendly three-stage distillation pipeline that enables streaming
super-resolution, (ii) locality-constrained sparse attention that cuts
redundant computation while bridging the train-test resolution gap, and (iii) a
tiny conditional decoder that accelerates reconstruction without sacrificing
quality. To support large-scale training, we also construct VSR-120K, a new
dataset with 120k videos and 180k images. Extensive experiments show that
FlashVSR scales reliably to ultra-high resolutions and achieves
state-of-the-art performance with up to 12x speedup over prior one-step
diffusion VSR models. We will release the code, pretrained models, and dataset
to foster future research in efficient diffusion-based VSR.

TL;DR: SPORTS是一个集成了视频全景分割、视觉里程计和场景渲染的统一框架，通过注意力机制融合多模态特征，提升场景感知和理解的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有场景感知方法存在分割缺陷、动态物体干扰、传感器数据稀疏和视角限制等问题，需要更全面的解决方案。

Method: 使用自适应注意力几何融合机制对齐跨帧特征，结合姿态、深度和光流模态；通过后匹配策略改进目标跟踪；将全景分割结果与光流图结合提升动态物体置信度估计；基于学习的范式生成深度图；使用点云渲染合成RGB视图和全景视图。

Result: 在三个公共数据集上的实验表明，该方法在里程计、跟踪、分割和新视角合成任务上优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: SPORTS框架通过紧密集成多个任务，实现了更全面的场景理解，为具身AI智能体提供了有效的场景感知解决方案。

Abstract: The scene perception, understanding, and simulation are fundamental
techniques for embodied-AI agents, while existing solutions are still prone to
segmentation deficiency, dynamic objects' interference, sensor data sparsity,
and view-limitation problems. This paper proposes a novel framework, named
SPORTS, for holistic scene understanding via tightly integrating Video Panoptic
Segmentation (VPS), Visual Odometry (VO), and Scene Rendering (SR) tasks into
an iterative and unified perspective. Firstly, VPS designs an adaptive
attention-based geometric fusion mechanism to align cross-frame features via
enrolling the pose, depth, and optical flow modality, which automatically
adjust feature maps for different decoding stages. And a post-matching strategy
is integrated to improve identities tracking. In VO, panoptic segmentation
results from VPS are combined with the optical flow map to improve the
confidence estimation of dynamic objects, which enhances the accuracy of the
camera pose estimation and completeness of the depth map generation via the
learning-based paradigm. Furthermore, the point-based rendering of SR is
beneficial from VO, transforming sparse point clouds into neural fields to
synthesize high-fidelity RGB views and twin panoptic views. Extensive
experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that our attention-based
feature fusion outperforms most existing state-of-the-art methods on the
odometry, tracking, segmentation, and novel view synthesis tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了VQArt-Bench，一个用于文化遗产领域的大规模视觉问答基准，通过多智能体管道生成多样化问题，评估多模态大语言模型在视觉艺术分析中的深度语义理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉问答基准在评估深度语义理解方面存在不足，特别是在视觉艺术分析等复杂领域，问题局限于简单句法结构和表面属性，导致模型利用统计捷径而非进行视觉推理。

Method: 使用新颖的多智能体管道，让专门化智能体协作生成经过验证的、语言多样化的细致问题，构建沿相关视觉理解维度结构化的基准。

Result: 对14个最先进的多模态大语言模型进行评估，发现当前模型存在显著局限性，包括在简单计数任务中的意外弱点，以及专有模型与开源模型之间的明显性能差距。

Conclusion: VQArt-Bench揭示了当前多模态大语言模型在深度视觉语义理解方面的不足，特别是在复杂文化领域，需要更强大的视觉推理能力。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant
capabilities in joint visual and linguistic tasks. However, existing Visual
Question Answering (VQA) benchmarks often fail to evaluate deep semantic
understanding, particularly in complex domains like visual art analysis.
Confined to simple syntactic structures and surface-level attributes, these
questions fail to capture the diversity and depth of human visual inquiry. This
limitation incentivizes models to exploit statistical shortcuts rather than
engage in visual reasoning. To address this gap, we introduce VQArt-Bench, a
new, large-scale VQA benchmark for the cultural heritage domain. This benchmark
is constructed using a novel multi-agent pipeline where specialized agents
collaborate to generate nuanced, validated, and linguistically diverse
questions. The resulting benchmark is structured along relevant visual
understanding dimensions that probe a model's ability to interpret symbolic
meaning, narratives, and complex visual relationships. Our evaluation of 14
state-of-the-art MLLMs on this benchmark reveals significant limitations in
current models, including a surprising weakness in simple counting tasks and a
clear performance gap between proprietary and open-source models.

*Wenpu Li,Bangyan Liao,Yi Zhou,Qi Xu,Pian Wan,Peidong Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无监督框架E-MoFlow，通过隐式时空和几何正则化联合优化自运动和光流估计，在事件相机数据上实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法将光流和6-DoF自运动估计作为独立任务处理，但在事件相机中由于缺乏稳健的数据关联，这变成了不适定问题。现有方法要么引入偏差和计算开销，要么容易陷入局部最优。

Method: 将相机自运动建模为连续样条，光流建模为隐式神经表示，通过归纳偏置嵌入时空一致性；结合微分几何约束引入结构和运动先验，避免显式深度估计。

Result: 在6-DoF运动场景中表现出色，在无监督方法中达到最先进性能，甚至与有监督方法相媲美。

Conclusion: E-MoFlow通过隐式正则化在完全无监督范式下统一了自运动和光流估计，展示了在通用6-DoF运动场景中的多功能性。

Abstract: The estimation of optical flow and 6-DoF ego-motion, two fundamental tasks in
3D vision, has typically been addressed independently. For neuromorphic vision
(e.g., event cameras), however, the lack of robust data association makes
solving the two problems separately an ill-posed challenge, especially in the
absence of supervision via ground truth. Existing works mitigate this
ill-posedness by either enforcing the smoothness of the flow field via an
explicit variational regularizer or leveraging explicit structure-and-motion
priors in the parametrization to improve event alignment. The former notably
introduces bias in results and computational overhead, while the latter, which
parametrizes the optical flow in terms of the scene depth and the camera
motion, often converges to suboptimal local minima. To address these issues, we
propose an unsupervised framework that jointly optimizes egomotion and optical
flow via implicit spatial-temporal and geometric regularization. First, by
modeling camera's egomotion as a continuous spline and optical flow as an
implicit neural representation, our method inherently embeds spatial-temporal
coherence through inductive biases. Second, we incorporate structure-and-motion
priors through differential geometric constraints, bypassing explicit depth
estimation while maintaining rigorous geometric consistency. As a result, our
framework (called E-MoFlow) unifies egomotion and optical flow estimation via
implicit regularization under a fully unsupervised paradigm. Experiments
demonstrate its versatility to general 6-DoF motion scenarios, achieving
state-of-the-art performance among unsupervised methods and competitive even
with supervised approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于深度学习的方法DL-HMC++，用于从PET原始数据预测头部运动并进行运动校正，无需外部硬件跟踪设备。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 头部运动在脑PET成像中会导致图像伪影和示踪剂定量不准确，而基于硬件的运动跟踪在临床实践中应用有限。

Method: 使用交叉注意力机制的深度学习模型，从1秒3D PET原始数据预测刚性头部运动，通过监督学习利用已有的动态PET扫描和硬件运动跟踪数据。

Result: 在两个PET扫描仪和四种示踪剂上验证，DL-HMC++优于现有数据驱动方法，产生的无运动图像与金标准硬件跟踪结果难以区分，标准摄取值差异率分别为1.2±0.5%和0.5±0.2%。

Conclusion: DL-HMC++展示了数据驱动PET头部运动校正的潜力，可消除硬件跟踪负担，使运动校正技术更易于在临床环境中应用。

Abstract: Head movement poses a significant challenge in brain positron emission
tomography (PET) imaging, resulting in image artifacts and tracer uptake
quantification inaccuracies. Effective head motion estimation and correction
are crucial for precise quantitative image analysis and accurate diagnosis of
neurological disorders. Hardware-based motion tracking (HMT) has limited
applicability in real-world clinical practice. To overcome this limitation, we
propose a deep-learning head motion correction approach with cross-attention
(DL-HMC++) to predict rigid head motion from one-second 3D PET raw data.
DL-HMC++ is trained in a supervised manner by leveraging existing dynamic PET
scans with gold-standard motion measurements from external HMT. We evaluate
DL-HMC++ on two PET scanners (HRRT and mCT) and four radiotracers (18F-FDG,
18F-FPEB, 11C-UCB-J, and 11C-LSN3172176) to demonstrate the effectiveness and
generalization of the approach in large cohort PET studies. Quantitative and
qualitative results demonstrate that DL-HMC++ consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art data-driven motion estimation methods, producing motion-free
images with clear delineation of brain structures and reduced motion artifacts
that are indistinguishable from gold-standard HMT. Brain region of interest
standard uptake value analysis exhibits average difference ratios between
DL-HMC++ and gold-standard HMT to be 1.2 plus-minus 0.5% for HRRT and 0.5
plus-minus 0.2% for mCT. DL-HMC++ demonstrates the potential for data-driven
PET head motion correction to remove the burden of HMT, making motion
correction accessible to clinical populations beyond research settings. The

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于学习的特征上采样方法（如DINO或CLIP）需要为每个特征提取器重新训练，无法在推理时泛化到不同的特征类型。

Method: 提出了一种推理时特征无关的上采样架构，该架构不依赖于特定编码器的训练。

Result: AnyUp在特征上采样方面达到了新的最先进水平，能够泛化到不同的特征类型，同时保持特征语义，并且高效且易于应用于各种下游任务。

Conclusion: AnyUp提供了一种通用、高效的特征上采样解决方案，显著提升了特征上采样的质量和泛化能力。

Abstract: We introduce AnyUp, a method for feature upsampling that can be applied to
any vision feature at any resolution, without encoder-specific training.
Existing learning-based upsamplers for features like DINO or CLIP need to be
re-trained for every feature extractor and thus do not generalize to different
feature types at inference time. In this work, we propose an inference-time
feature-agnostic upsampling architecture to alleviate this limitation and
improve upsampling quality. In our experiments, AnyUp sets a new state of the
art for upsampled features, generalizes to different feature types, and
preserves feature semantics while being efficient and easy to apply to a wide
range of downstream tasks.

Motivation: 虽然高效的PSNR导向超分辨率取得了显著进展，但专注于感知质量度量的方法仍然相对低效。本文旨在弥补这一差距。

Method: 在严格效率约束下(最大5M参数和2000 GFLOPs)开发高效感知超分辨率方法，并使用包含500张4K测试图像的新数据集进行评估，这些图像经过多种退化处理。

Result: 表现最佳的方法在所有基准数据集上都优于Real-ESRGAN，证明了高效方法在感知领域的潜力。

Conclusion: 本文为高效感知超分辨率建立了现代基准。

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive study and benchmark on Efficient
Perceptual Super-Resolution (EPSR). While significant progress has been made in
efficient PSNR-oriented super resolution, approaches focusing on perceptual
quality metrics remain relatively inefficient. Motivated by this gap, we aim to
replicate or improve the perceptual results of Real-ESRGAN while meeting strict
efficiency constraints: a maximum of 5M parameters and 2000 GFLOPs, calculated
for an input size of 960x540 pixels. The proposed solutions were evaluated on a
novel dataset consisting of 500 test images of 4K resolution, each degraded
using multiple degradation types, without providing the original high-quality
counterparts. This design aims to reflect realistic deployment conditions and
serves as a diverse and challenging benchmark. The top-performing approach
manages to outperform Real-ESRGAN across all benchmark datasets, demonstrating
the potential of efficient methods in the perceptual domain. This paper
establishes the modern baselines for efficient perceptual super resolution.

TL;DR: USplat4D是一个不确定性感知的动态高斯泼溅框架，通过建模每个高斯原语的时间变化不确定性，构建时空图进行不确定性感知优化，提升4D重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统动态高斯泼溅模型对所有高斯原语进行统一优化，忽略了它们在观察质量上的差异，导致遮挡下的运动漂移和极端视角下的合成质量下降。

Method: 估计每个高斯原语的时间变化不确定性，构建时空图进行不确定性感知优化，将可靠的运动线索传播到整个场景。

Result: 在多种真实和合成数据集上的实验表明，显式建模不确定性能够持续改进动态高斯泼溅模型，在遮挡下产生更稳定的几何结构，在极端视角下实现高质量的合成。

Conclusion: 不确定性建模对于动态高斯泼溅方法至关重要，USplat4D通过不确定性感知优化有效解决了遮挡和极端视角下的重建挑战。

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic 3D scenes from monocular input is fundamentally
under-constrained, with ambiguities arising from occlusion and extreme novel
views. While dynamic Gaussian Splatting offers an efficient representation,
vanilla models optimize all Gaussian primitives uniformly, ignoring whether
they are well or poorly observed. This limitation leads to motion drifts under
occlusion and degraded synthesis when extrapolating to unseen views. We argue
that uncertainty matters: Gaussians with recurring observations across views
and time act as reliable anchors to guide motion, whereas those with limited
visibility are treated as less reliable. To this end, we introduce USplat4D, a
novel Uncertainty-aware dynamic Gaussian Splatting framework that propagates
reliable motion cues to enhance 4D reconstruction. Our key insight is to
estimate time-varying per-Gaussian uncertainty and leverages it to construct a
spatio-temporal graph for uncertainty-aware optimization. Experiments on
diverse real and synthetic datasets show that explicitly modeling uncertainty
consistently improves dynamic Gaussian Splatting models, yielding more stable
geometry under occlusion and high-quality synthesis at extreme viewpoints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法通常只能对场景动态进行密集采样生成单一实现，无法有效表示多模态运动及其对物理交互的依赖关系。

Method: 使用FPT框架，基于稀疏交互（称为"pokes"）直接预测局部运动分布，提供可解释的运动表示。

Result: 在密集人脸运动生成任务中，通用预训练模型超越专用基线；在强分布外任务中，经过微调后在关节物体运动估计上显著优于域内方法；在基于pokes的运动部件分割任务中表现竞争力。

Conclusion: FPT提供了一种灵活且通用的方法，能够直接预测多模态运动分布，在各种下游任务中展现出优越性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Understanding the dynamics of a physical scene involves reasoning about the
diverse ways it can potentially change, especially as a result of local
interactions. We present the Flow Poke Transformer (FPT), a novel framework for
directly predicting the distribution of local motion, conditioned on sparse
interactions termed "pokes". Unlike traditional methods that typically only
enable dense sampling of a single realization of scene dynamics, FPT provides
an interpretable directly accessible representation of multi-modal scene
motion, its dependency on physical interactions and the inherent uncertainties
of scene dynamics. We also evaluate our model on several downstream tasks to
enable comparisons with prior methods and highlight the flexibility of our
approach. On dense face motion generation, our generic pre-trained model
surpasses specialized baselines. FPT can be fine-tuned in strongly
out-of-distribution tasks such as synthetic datasets to enable significant
improvements over in-domain methods in articulated object motion estimation.
Additionally, predicting explicit motion distributions directly enables our
method to achieve competitive performance on tasks like moving part
segmentation from pokes which further demonstrates the versatility of our FPT.

Motivation: 现有统一多模态模型中，强大的视觉理解能力往往无法有效转移到视觉生成任务上，这促使研究者探索模型能否通过理解模块来奖励生成模块实现自我改进。

Method: 提出SRUM自奖励后训练框架，包含全局-局部双奖励系统：全局奖励确保整体视觉语义和布局的正确性，局部奖励细化细粒度的对象级保真度。

Result: 在T2I-CompBench上性能从82.18提升到88.37，在T2I-ReasonBench上从43.82提升到46.75，展现了强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该工作建立了一个新范式，使统一多模态模型能够通过自奖励机制实现理解模块对生成模块的引导和增强。

Abstract: Recently, remarkable progress has been made in Unified Multimodal Models
(UMMs), which integrate vision-language generation and understanding
capabilities within a single framework. However, a significant gap exists where
a model's strong visual understanding often fails to transfer to its visual
generation. A model might correctly understand an image based on user
instructions, yet be unable to generate a faithful image from text prompts.
This phenomenon directly raises a compelling question: Can a model achieve
self-improvement by using its understanding module to reward its generation
module? To bridge this gap and achieve self-improvement, we introduce SRUM, a
self-rewarding post-training framework that can be directly applied to existing
UMMs of various designs. SRUM creates a feedback loop where the model's own
understanding module acts as an internal ``evaluator'', providing corrective
signals to improve its generation module, without requiring additional
human-labeled data. To ensure this feedback is comprehensive, we designed a
global-local dual reward system. To tackle the inherent structural complexity
of images, this system offers multi-scale guidance: a \textbf{global reward}
ensures the correctness of the overall visual semantics and layout, while a
\textbf{local reward} refines fine-grained, object-level fidelity. SRUM leads
to powerful capabilities and shows strong generalization, boosting performance
on T2I-CompBench from 82.18 to \textbf{88.37} and on T2I-ReasonBench from 43.82
to \textbf{46.75}. Overall, our work establishes a powerful new paradigm for
enabling a UMMs' understanding module to guide and enhance its own generation
via self-rewarding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统创建逼真数字人化身的过程昂贵耗时，需要大型相机捕捉设备和专业3D艺术家。现有基于单张图像的方法虽然降低了门槛，但缺乏多视角信息或显式3D表示，导致在偏离参考视角时质量下降。

Method: 基于最先进的预训练视频扩散模型，从单张参考图像和目标表情生成可动画化的多视角视频，同时生成数百帧，视角变化可达360度，并将输出提炼为可实时渲染的4D化身。

Conclusion: MVP4D通过生成多视角视频并提炼为4D化身，有效解决了单图像方法在视角偏离时的质量问题，为数字人创建提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Digital human avatars aim to simulate the dynamic appearance of humans in
virtual environments, enabling immersive experiences across gaming, film,
virtual reality, and more. However, the conventional process for creating and
animating photorealistic human avatars is expensive and time-consuming,
requiring large camera capture rigs and significant manual effort from
professional 3D artists. With the advent of capable image and video generation
models, recent methods enable automatic rendering of realistic animated avatars
from a single casually captured reference image of a target subject. While
these techniques significantly lower barriers to avatar creation and offer
compelling realism, they lack constraints provided by multi-view information or
an explicit 3D representation. So, image quality and realism degrade when
rendered from viewpoints that deviate strongly from the reference image. Here,
we build a video model that generates animatable multi-view videos of digital
humans based on a single reference image and target expressions. Our model,
MVP4D, is based on a state-of-the-art pre-trained video diffusion model and
generates hundreds of frames simultaneously from viewpoints varying by up to
360 degrees around a target subject. We show how to distill the outputs of this
model into a 4D avatar that can be rendered in real-time. Our approach
significantly improves the realism, temporal consistency, and 3D consistency of
generated avatars compared to previous methods.

*Kevin Li,Manuel Brack,Sudeep Katakol,Hareesh Ravi,Ajinkya Kale*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniFusion是一个基于扩散的生成模型，使用冻结的大型视觉语言模型作为统一的多模态编码器，通过层间注意力池化机制提取文本和视觉特征，实现了跨模态推理和知识迁移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉生成架构通常使用独立的图像和文本编码器，限制了跨模态推理和知识迁移能力。之前的统一模型方法需要大量计算资源和数据，限制了可访问性。

Method: 提出Layerwise Attention Pooling机制从冻结VLM中提取高层次语义和低层次细节；开发VERIFI方法，在模型内提示重写时仅基于VLM生成的文本标记来调节扩散变换器。

Result: LAP在文本-图像对齐方面优于其他浅层融合架构；编辑任务的微调不仅改善了生成的对齐，还表现出强大的泛化能力，能够零样本泛化到多图像参考。

Conclusion: UniFusion的统一编码器设计证明了跨模态知识迁移的有效性，为生成模型提供了更强的推理能力和灵活性。

Abstract: Although recent advances in visual generation have been remarkable, most
existing architectures still depend on distinct encoders for images and text.
This separation constrains diffusion models' ability to perform cross-modal
reasoning and knowledge transfer. Prior attempts to bridge this gap often use
the last layer information from VLM, employ multiple visual encoders, or train
large unified models jointly for text and image generation, which demands
substantial computational resources and large-scale data, limiting its
accessibility.We present UniFusion, a diffusion-based generative model
conditioned on a frozen large vision-language model (VLM) that serves as a
unified multimodal encoder. At the core of UniFusion is the Layerwise Attention
Pooling (LAP) mechanism that extracts both high level semantics and low level
details from text and visual tokens of a frozen VLM to condition a diffusion
generative model. We demonstrate that LAP outperforms other shallow fusion
architectures on text-image alignment for generation and faithful transfer of
visual information from VLM to the diffusion model which is key for editing. We
propose VLM-Enabled Rewriting Injection with Flexibile Inference (VERIFI),
which conditions a diffusion transformer (DiT) only on the text tokens
generated by the VLM during in-model prompt rewriting. VERIFI combines the
alignment of the conditioning distribution with the VLM's reasoning
capabilities for increased capabilities and flexibility at inference. In
addition, finetuning on editing task not only improves text-image alignment for
generation, indicative of cross-modality knowledge transfer, but also exhibits
tremendous generalization capabilities. Our model when trained on single image
editing, zero-shot generalizes to multiple image references further motivating
the unified encoder design of UniFusion.

*Long Cui,Weiyun Wang,Jie Shao,Zichen Wen,Gen Luo,Linfeng Zhang,Yanting Zhang,Yu Qiao,Wenhai Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViCO是一种训练算法，通过基于图像语义复杂度的视觉token压缩来降低多模态大语言模型的推理成本


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型由于图像输入引入的额外视觉token导致推理成本增加

Method: 使用多个具有不同图像压缩率的MLP连接器，在训练时最小化不同MLP连接器条件响应的KL散度，推理时通过视觉分辨率路由器自动选择每个图像块的最佳压缩率

Result: 实验结果表明该方法可将视觉token数量减少高达50%，同时保持模型的感知、推理和OCR能力

Conclusion: 这项工作有助于开发更高效的多模态大语言模型

Abstract: Existing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) suffer from increased
inference costs due to the additional vision tokens introduced by image inputs.
In this work, we propose Visual Consistency Learning (ViCO), a novel training
algorithm that enables the model to represent images of varying semantic
complexities using different numbers of vision tokens. The key idea behind our
method is to employ multiple MLP connectors, each with a different image
compression ratio, to downsample the vision tokens based on the semantic
complexity of the image. During training, we minimize the KL divergence between
the responses conditioned on different MLP connectors. At inference time, we
introduce an image router, termed Visual Resolution Router (ViR), that
automatically selects the appropriate compression rate for each image patch.
Compared with existing dynamic high-resolution strategies, which adjust the
number of visual tokens based on image resolutions, our method dynamically
adapts the number of visual tokens according to semantic complexity.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method can reduce the number of
vision tokens by up to 50% while maintaining the model's perception, reasoning,
and OCR capabilities. We hope this work will contribute to the development of
more efficient MLLMs. The code and models will be released to facilitate future
research.

*Caner Korkmaz,Brighton Nuwagira,Barış Coşkunuzer,Tolga Birdal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CuMPerLay是一个可微分的向量化层，将立方多参数持久性(CMP)集成到深度学习管道中，通过分解CMP为可学习的单参数持久性，为图像分析提供稳健的拓扑特征向量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CMP虽然为图像拓扑分析提供了强大方法，但由于多过滤结构的复杂性和CMP向量化的困难，其应用受到限制。

Method: 提出新算法向量化立方复形的多参数同调，将CMP分解为可学习的单参数持久性组合，双过滤函数联合学习，具有可微性。

Result: 在基准医学影像和计算机视觉数据集上的实验显示，CuMPerLay在分类和分割任务中表现优异，特别是在数据有限的情况下。

Conclusion: CuMPerLay为将全局结构信息集成到深度网络中提供了有前景的方向，适用于结构化图像分析。

Abstract: We present CuMPerLay, a novel differentiable vectorization layer that enables
the integration of Cubical Multiparameter Persistence (CMP) into deep learning
pipelines. While CMP presents a natural and powerful way to topologically work
with images, its use is hindered by the complexity of multifiltration
structures as well as the vectorization of CMP. In face of these challenges, we
introduce a new algorithm for vectorizing MP homologies of cubical complexes.
Our CuMPerLay decomposes the CMP into a combination of individual, learnable
single-parameter persistence, where the bifiltration functions are jointly
learned. Thanks to the differentiability, its robust topological feature
vectors can be seamlessly used within state-of-the-art architectures such as
Swin Transformers. We establish theoretical guarantees for the stability of our
vectorization under generalized Wasserstein metrics. Our experiments on
benchmark medical imaging and computer vision datasets show the benefit
CuMPerLay on classification and segmentation performance, particularly in
limited-data scenarios. Overall, CuMPerLay offers a promising direction for
integrating global structural information into deep networks for structured
image analysis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DriveVLA-W0通过世界建模预测未来图像来解决VLA模型的监督不足问题，使用自回归和扩散两种世界模型架构，结合轻量级动作专家降低推理延迟，在多个基准测试中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视觉-语言-动作模型中存在的"监督不足"问题，即模型的大容量仅被稀疏的低维动作监督，导致表征能力未被充分利用。

Method: 提出DriveVLA-W0训练范式，使用世界建模预测未来图像作为密集自监督信号；为两种主要VLA架构分别实现自回归世界模型（离散视觉标记）和扩散世界模型（连续视觉特征）；引入轻量级动作专家降低推理延迟。

Result: 在NAVSIM v1/v2基准测试和680倍更大的内部数据集上显著优于BEV和VLA基线方法；增强了数据缩放定律，显示随着训练数据集增大，性能提升加速。

Conclusion: 世界建模是解决VLA模型监督不足的有效方法，能够充分利用模型表征能力，DriveVLA-W0在自动驾驶任务中表现出色且具有良好可扩展性。

Abstract: Scaling Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models on large-scale data offers a
promising path to achieving a more generalized driving intelligence. However,
VLA models are limited by a ``supervision deficit'': the vast model capacity is
supervised by sparse, low-dimensional actions, leaving much of their
representational power underutilized. To remedy this, we propose
\textbf{DriveVLA-W0}, a training paradigm that employs world modeling to
predict future images. This task generates a dense, self-supervised signal that
compels the model to learn the underlying dynamics of the driving environment.
We showcase the paradigm's versatility by instantiating it for two dominant VLA
archetypes: an autoregressive world model for VLAs that use discrete visual
tokens, and a diffusion world model for those operating on continuous visual
features. Building on the rich representations learned from world modeling, we
introduce a lightweight action expert to address the inference latency for
real-time deployment. Extensive experiments on the NAVSIM v1/v2 benchmark and a
680x larger in-house dataset demonstrate that DriveVLA-W0 significantly
outperforms BEV and VLA baselines. Crucially, it amplifies the data scaling
law, showing that performance gains accelerate as the training dataset size
increases.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Rex-Omni是一个3B规模的MLLM，在零样本设置下实现了与回归模型相当的物体检测性能，并通过特殊token表示坐标、多数据引擎和两阶段训练解决了现有MLLM在物体检测中的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统坐标回归模型主导物体检测，但现有MLLM方法面临召回率低、重复预测、坐标不对齐等问题，需要弥合这一差距。

Method: 1) 使用特殊token表示量化坐标；2) 构建多个数据引擎生成高质量标注数据；3) 采用两阶段训练：2200万数据的监督微调 + 基于GRPO的强化学习后训练。

Result: 在COCO和LVIS基准测试中，Rex-Omni在零样本设置下达到或超过回归模型（如DINO、Grounding DINO）的性能。

Conclusion: Rex-Omni为更通用和语言感知的视觉感知系统铺平了道路，具备物体指代、指向、视觉提示、GUI定位、空间指代、OCR和关键点检测等多样化能力。

Abstract: Object detection has long been dominated by traditional coordinate
regression-based models, such as YOLO, DETR, and Grounding DINO. Although
recent efforts have attempted to leverage MLLMs to tackle this task, they face
challenges like low recall rate, duplicate predictions, coordinate
misalignment, etc. In this work, we bridge this gap and propose Rex-Omni, a
3B-scale MLLM that achieves state-of-the-art object perception performance. On
benchmarks like COCO and LVIS, Rex-Omni attains performance comparable to or
exceeding regression-based models (e.g., DINO, Grounding DINO) in a zero-shot
setting. This is enabled by three key designs: 1) Task Formulation: we use
special tokens to represent quantized coordinates from 0 to 999, reducing the
model's learning difficulty and improving token efficiency for coordinate
prediction; 2) Data Engines: we construct multiple data engines to generate
high-quality grounding, referring, and pointing data, providing semantically
rich supervision for training; \3) Training Pipelines: we employ a two-stage
training process, combining supervised fine-tuning on 22 million data with
GRPO-based reinforcement post-training. This RL post-training leverages
geometry-aware rewards to effectively bridge the discrete-to-continuous
coordinate prediction gap, improve box accuracy, and mitigate undesirable
behaviors like duplicate predictions that stem from the teacher-guided nature
of the initial SFT stage. Beyond conventional detection, Rex-Omni's inherent
language understanding enables versatile capabilities such as object referring,
pointing, visual prompting, GUI grounding, spatial referring, OCR and
key-pointing, all systematically evaluated on dedicated benchmarks. We believe
that Rex-Omni paves the way for more versatile and language-aware visual
perception systems.

TL;DR: DeepMMSearch-R1是首个能够按需进行多轮网络搜索、动态构建图像和文本搜索查询的多模态大语言模型，通过两阶段训练提升搜索效率和效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有检索增强生成方法存在的流程僵化、搜索调用过多、查询构建不佳等问题，使多模态大模型能够更好地处理信息搜索和知识密集型查询。

Method: 采用两阶段训练：冷启动监督微调阶段和在线强化学习优化。构建DeepMMSearchVQA数据集，训练模型决定何时搜索、搜索什么、使用哪种搜索工具以及如何对检索信息进行推理。

Result: 在多个知识密集型基准测试中表现出优越性能，能够基于输入图像的相关裁剪启动网络搜索，并迭代调整文本搜索查询实现自我反思和修正。

Conclusion: 该方法为推进多模态网络搜索提供了有价值的见解，通过动态查询构建和迭代优化显著提升了搜索效率和结果质量。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in real-world applications require
access to external knowledge sources and must remain responsive to the dynamic
and ever-changing real-world information in order to address
information-seeking and knowledge-intensive user queries. Existing approaches,
such as retrieval augmented generation (RAG) methods, search agents, and search
equipped MLLMs, often suffer from rigid pipelines, excessive search calls, and
poorly constructed search queries, which result in inefficiencies and
suboptimal outcomes. To address these limitations, we present DeepMMSearch-R1,
the first multimodal LLM capable of performing on-demand, multi-turn web
searches and dynamically crafting queries for both image and text search tools.
Specifically, DeepMMSearch-R1 can initiate web searches based on relevant crops
of the input image making the image search more effective, and can iteratively
adapt text search queries based on retrieved information, thereby enabling
self-reflection and self-correction. Our approach relies on a two-stage
training pipeline: a cold start supervised finetuning phase followed by an
online reinforcement learning optimization. For training, we introduce
DeepMMSearchVQA, a novel multimodal VQA dataset created through an automated
pipeline intermixed with real-world information from web search tools. This
dataset contains diverse, multi-hop queries that integrate textual and visual
information, teaching the model when to search, what to search for, which
search tool to use and how to reason over the retrieved information. We conduct
extensive experiments across a range of knowledge-intensive benchmarks to
demonstrate the superiority of our approach. Finally, we analyze the results
and provide insights that are valuable for advancing multimodal web-search.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管毫米/微米机器人在技术上取得了显著进展，但大多数仍停留在实验室概念验证阶段，缺乏实际应用可行性。需要弥合技术创新与现实应用之间的差距，推动临床整合。

Method: 引入战略性的毫米/微米机器人技术就绪度框架（mTRL），该系统开发从初始概念到临床采用，通过明确定义的里程碑和逐步活动来映射。

Result: mTRL模型提供了一个结构化技术成熟度评估标准，为跨学科合作提供共同语言，并为加速转化发展提供可操作指导。

Conclusion: 该领域的长期影响和可持续性取决于将开发与未满足的医疗需求对齐，确保应用可行性，并无缝整合到现有临床工作流程中，这些都是实现有意义患者结果的重要支柱。

Abstract: Untethered mobile milli/microrobots hold transformative potential for
interventional medicine by enabling more precise and entirely non-invasive
diagnosis and therapy. Realizing this promise requires bridging the gap between
groundbreaking laboratory demonstrations and successful clinical integration.
Despite remarkable technical progress over the past two decades, most
millirobots and microrobots remain confined to laboratory proof-of-concept
demonstrations, with limited real-world feasibility. In this Review, we
identify key factors that slow translation from bench to bedside, focusing on
the disconnect between technical innovation and real-world application. We
argue that the long-term impact and sustainability of the field depend on
aligning development with unmet medical needs, ensuring applied feasibility,
and integrating seamlessly into existing clinical workflows, which are
essential pillars for delivering meaningful patient outcomes. To support this
shift, we introduce a strategic milli/microrobot Technology Readiness Level
framework (mTRL), which maps system development from initial conceptualization
to clinical adoption through clearly defined milestones and their associated
stepwise activities. The mTRL model provides a structured gauge of
technological maturity, a common language for cross-disciplinary collaboration
and actionable guidance to accelerate translational development toward new,
safer and more efficient interventions.

Result: 在公开数据集上的广泛实验验证了该方法相对于当前最先进方法的优越性能

Conclusion: 提出的Outram-GSF全局定位管道通过连续语义函数捕获更细粒度的地理语义信息，有效解决了地标重复性问题

Abstract: We present a one-shot LiDAR global localization algorithm featuring semantic
disambiguation ability based on a lightweight tri-layered scene graph. While
landmark semantic registration-based methods have shown promising performance
improvements in global localization compared with geometric-only methods,
landmarks can be repetitive and misleading for correspondence establishment. We
propose to mitigate this problem by modeling semantic distributions with
continuous functions learned from a population of Gaussian processes. Compared
with discrete semantic labels, the continuous functions capture finer-grained
geo-semantic information and also provide more detailed metric information for
correspondence establishment. We insert this continuous function as the middle
layer between the object layer and the metric-semantic layer, forming a
tri-layered 3D scene graph, serving as a light-weight yet performant backend
for one-shot localization. We term our global localization pipeline Outram-GSF
(Gaussian semantic field) and conduct a wide range of experiments on publicly
available data sets, validating the superior performance against the current
state-of-the-art.

Motivation: 越野自动驾驶车辆需要在实时规划中同时考虑曲率可行路径、土壤强度和斜坡危险，现有方法难以在复杂地形中实现稳定导航。

Method: 使用连续状态-成本度量结合Bekker压力-沉降模型和坡度惩罚，在格网上评估地形成本，采用Vehicle-Dynamics RRT*进行全局探索，Vehicle-Dynamics D* Lite进行局部修复。

Result: 硬件试验表明该框架能够在软土和斜坡过渡区域实现实时导航，在非结构化环境中提供可靠的自主性。

Conclusion: 该框架通过分离地形-车辆模型与规划器，为可变形地形中的确定性、采样或学习驱动规划提供了可重用的基础。

Abstract: Autonomous ground vehicles operating off-road must plan curvature-feasible
paths while accounting for spatially varying soil strength and slope hazards in
real time. We present a continuous state--cost metric that combines a Bekker
pressure--sinkage model with elevation-derived slope and attitude penalties.
The resulting terrain cost field is analytic, bounded, and monotonic in soil
modulus and slope, ensuring well-posed discretization and stable updates under
sensor noise. This metric is evaluated on a lattice with exact steering
primitives: Dubins and Reeds--Shepp motions for differential drive and
time-parameterized bicycle arcs for Ackermann steering. Global exploration is
performed using Vehicle-Dynamics RRT\(^{*}\), while local repair is managed by
Vehicle-Dynamics D\(^{*}\) Lite, enabling millisecond-scale replanning without
heuristic smoothing. By separating the terrain--vehicle model from the planner,
the framework provides a reusable basis for deterministic, sampling-based, or
learning-driven planning in deformable terrain. Hardware trials on an off-road
platform demonstrate real-time navigation across soft soil and slope
transitions, supporting reliable autonomy in unstructured environments.

Conclusion: 可控碰撞场景生成有助于发现现有规划器局限，通过针对性训练可提高自动驾驶车辆在不同碰撞场景中的安全性。

Abstract: Evaluating the safety of autonomous vehicles (AVs) requires diverse,
safety-critical scenarios, with collisions being especially important yet rare
and unsafe to collect in the real world. Therefore, the community has been
focusing on generating safety-critical scenarios in simulation. However,
controlling attributes such as collision type and time-to-accident (TTA)
remains challenging. We introduce a new task called controllable collision
scenario generation, where the goal is to produce trajectories that realize a
user-specified collision type and TTA, to investigate the feasibility of
automatically generating desired collision scenarios. To support this task, we
present COLLIDE, a large-scale collision scenario dataset constructed by
transforming real-world driving logs into diverse collisions, balanced across
five representative collision types and different TTA intervals. We propose a
framework that predicts Collision Pattern, a compact and interpretable
representation that captures the spatial configuration of the ego and the
adversarial vehicles at impact, before rolling out full adversarial
trajectories. Experiments show that our approach outperforms strong baselines
in both collision rate and controllability. Furthermore, generated scenarios
consistently induce higher planner failure rates, revealing limitations of
existing planners. We demonstrate that these scenarios fine-tune planners for
robustness improvements, contributing to safer AV deployment in different
collision scenarios.

Conclusion: 该框架成功平衡了导航策略的适应性和安全性，在模拟和真实场景中都表现出色。

Abstract: Mobile robot navigation in dynamic human environments requires policies that
balance adaptability to diverse behaviors with compliance to safety
constraints. We hypothesize that integrating data-driven rewards with
rule-based objectives enables navigation policies to achieve a more effective
balance of adaptability and safety. To this end, we develop a framework that
learns a density-based reward from positive and negative demonstrations and
augments it with rule-based objectives for obstacle avoidance and goal
reaching. A sampling-based lookahead controller produces supervisory actions
that are both safe and adaptive, which are subsequently distilled into a
compact student policy suitable for real-time operation with uncertainty
estimates. Experiments in synthetic and elevator co-boarding simulations show
consistent gains in success rate and time efficiency over baselines, and
real-world demonstrations with human participants confirm the practicality of
deployment. A video illustrating this work can be found on our project page

TL;DR: 提出了Spatial Forcing (SF)方法，通过将VLA模型的中间视觉嵌入与预训练3D基础模型的几何表示对齐，在不依赖显式3D输入或深度估计器的情况下，强制VLA模型发展空间理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的VLA模型大多基于仅使用2D数据预训练的视觉语言模型，缺乏准确的空间感知能力，限制了在3D物理世界中的操作能力。现有解决方案要么依赖有噪声的3D传感器输入，要么受限于深度估计器的性能。

Method: SF是一种简单有效的对齐策略，将VLA模型的中间视觉嵌入与预训练3D基础模型生成的几何表示进行对齐。通过在中间层强制对齐，引导VLA模型编码更丰富的空间表示。

Result: 在仿真和真实环境中的广泛实验表明，SF实现了最先进的结果，超越了基于2D和3D的VLA模型。SF进一步将训练速度提高了3.8倍，并在各种机器人任务中提高了数据效率。

Conclusion: SF通过隐式强制VLA模型发展空间理解能力，无需依赖显式3D输入或深度估计器，显著提升了VLA模型在3D物理世界中的操作精度和效率。

Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models have recently shown strong potential in
enabling robots to follow language instructions and execute precise actions.
However, most VLAs are built upon vision-language models pretrained solely on
2D data, which lack accurate spatial awareness and hinder their ability to
operate in the 3D physical world. Existing solutions attempt to incorporate
explicit 3D sensor inputs such as depth maps or point clouds, but these
approaches face challenges due to sensor noise, hardware heterogeneity, and
incomplete depth coverage in existing datasets. Alternative methods that
estimate 3D cues from 2D images also suffer from the limited performance of
depth estimators.We propose Spatial Forcing (SF), a simple yet effective
alignment strategy that implicitly forces VLA models to develop spatial
comprehension capabilities without relying on explicit 3D inputs or depth
estimators. SF aligns intermediate visual embeddings of VLAs with geometric
representations produced by pretrained 3D foundation models. By enforcing
alignment at intermediate layers, SF guides VLAs to encode richer spatial
representations that enhance action precision.Extensive experiments in
simulation and real-world environments demonstrate that SF achieves
state-of-the-art results, surpassing both 2D- and 3D-based VLAs. SF further
accelerates training by up to 3.8x and improves data efficiency across diverse
robotic tasks. Project page is at https://spatial-forcing.github.io/

Conclusion: 该框架具有提高微创内窥镜手术安全性、可靠性和操作效率的潜力，并适用于其他受限和安全关键环境。

Abstract: This paper presents a shape-aware whole-body control framework for
tendon-driven continuum robots with direct application to endoluminal surgical
navigation. Endoluminal procedures, such as bronchoscopy, demand precise and
safe navigation through tortuous, patient-specific anatomy where conventional
tip-only control often leads to wall contact, tissue trauma, or failure to
reach distal targets. To address these challenges, our approach combines a
physics-informed backbone model with residual learning through an Augmented
Neural ODE, enabling accurate shape estimation and efficient Jacobian
computation. A sampling-based Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) controller
leverages this representation to jointly optimize tip tracking, backbone
conformance, and obstacle avoidance under actuation constraints. A task manager
further enhances adaptability by allowing real-time adjustment of objectives,
such as wall clearance or direct advancement, during tele-operation. Extensive
simulation studies demonstrate millimeter-level accuracy across diverse
scenarios, including trajectory tracking, dynamic obstacle avoidance, and

Abstract: Recently, biped robot walking technology has been significantly developed,
mainly in the context of a bland walking scheme. To emulate human walking,
robots need to step on the positions they see in unknown spaces accurately. In
this paper, we present PolyMap, a perception-based locomotion planning
framework for humanoid robots to climb stairs. Our core idea is to build a
real-time polygonal staircase plane semantic map, followed by a footstep planar
using these polygonal plane segments. These plane segmentation and visual
odometry are done by multi-sensor fusion(LiDAR, RGB-D camera and IMUs). The
proposed framework is deployed on a NVIDIA Orin, which performs 20-30 Hz
whole-body motion planning output. Both indoor and outdoor real-scene
experiments indicate that our method is efficient and robust for humanoid robot
stair climbing.

Method: 使用任务无关的探索性数据收集算法获取多样化动态转换数据，通过监督学习训练本体感觉逆动力学模型(PIDM)，将预训练权重加载到actor和critic网络中为PPO算法提供热启动。

Abstract: The pretraining-finetuning paradigm has facilitated numerous transformative
advancements in artificial intelligence research in recent years. However, in
the domain of reinforcement learning (RL) for robot motion control, individual
skills are often learned from scratch despite the high likelihood that some
generalizable knowledge is shared across all task-specific policies belonging
to a single robot embodiment. This work aims to define a paradigm for
pretraining neural network models that encapsulate such knowledge and can
subsequently serve as a basis for warm-starting the RL process in classic
actor-critic algorithms, such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). We begin
with a task-agnostic exploration-based data collection algorithm to gather
diverse, dynamic transition data, which is then used to train a Proprioceptive
Inverse Dynamics Model (PIDM) through supervised learning. The pretrained
weights are loaded into both the actor and critic networks to warm-start the
policy optimization of actual tasks. We systematically validated our proposed
method on seven distinct robot motion control tasks, showing significant
benefits to this initialization strategy. Our proposed approach on average
improves sample efficiency by 40.1% and task performance by 7.5%, compared to
random initialization. We further present key ablation studies and empirical
analyses that shed light on the mechanisms behind the effectiveness of our
method.

Conclusion: 该框架成功实现了机器人运动可读性的连续控制，为人类-机器人交互中意图表达的灵活调节提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Legibility of robot motion is critical in human-robot interaction, as it
allows humans to quickly infer a robot's intended goal. Although traditional
trajectory generation methods typically prioritize efficiency, they often fail
to make the robot's intentions clear to humans. Meanwhile, existing approaches
to legible motion usually produce only a single "most legible" trajectory,
overlooking the need to modulate intent expressiveness in different contexts.
In this work, we propose a novel motion generation framework that enables
controllable legibility across the full spectrum, from highly legible to highly
ambiguous motions. We introduce a modeling approach based on an Information
Potential Field to assign continuous legibility scores to trajectories, and
build upon it with a two-stage diffusion framework that first generates paths
at specified legibility levels and then translates them into executable robot
actions. Experiments in both 2D and 3D reaching tasks demonstrate that our
approach produces diverse and controllable motions with varying degrees of
legibility, while achieving performance comparable to SOTA. Code and project

Conclusion: 提出的自引导和自适应分块技术有效解决了扩散策略的随机性和延迟问题，提升了生成行为克隆在机器人学习中的表现。

Abstract: Generative Behavior Cloning (GBC) is a simple yet effective framework for
robot learning, particularly in multi-task settings. Recent GBC methods often
employ diffusion policies with open-loop (OL) control, where actions are
generated via a diffusion process and executed in multi-step chunks without
replanning. While this approach has demonstrated strong success rates and
generalization, its inherent stochasticity can result in erroneous action
sampling, occasionally leading to unexpected task failures. Moreover, OL
control suffers from delayed responses, which can degrade performance in noisy
or dynamic environments. To address these limitations, we propose two novel
techniques to enhance the consistency and reactivity of diffusion policies: (1)
self-guidance, which improves action fidelity by leveraging past observations
and implicitly promoting future-aware behavior; and (2) adaptive chunking,
which selectively updates action sequences when the benefits of reactivity
outweigh the need for temporal consistency. Extensive experiments show that our
approach substantially improves GBC performance across a wide range of
simulated and real-world robotic manipulation tasks. Our code is available at

Abstract: Tactile sensors have a wide range of applications, from utilization in
robotic grippers to human motion measurement. If tactile sensors could be
fabricated and integrated more easily, their applicability would further
expand. In this study, we propose a tactile sensor-M3D-skin-that can be easily
fabricated with high versatility by leveraging the infill patterns of a
multi-material fused deposition modeling (FDM) 3D printer as the sensing
principle. This method employs conductive and non-conductive flexible filaments
to create a hierarchical structure with a specific infill pattern. The flexible
hierarchical structure deforms under pressure, leading to a change in
electrical resistance, enabling the acquisition of tactile information. We
measure the changes in characteristics of the proposed tactile sensor caused by
modifications to the hierarchical structure. Additionally, we demonstrate the
fabrication and use of a multi-tile sensor. Furthermore, as applications, we
implement motion pattern measurement on the sole of a foot, integration with a
robotic hand, and tactile-based robotic operations. Through these experiments,
we validate the effectiveness of the proposed tactile sensor.

Abstract: In a Human-Robot Cooperation (HRC) environment, safety and efficiency are the
two core properties to evaluate robot performance. However, safety mechanisms
usually hinder task efficiency since human intervention will cause backup
motions and goal failures of the robot. Frequent motion replanning will
increase the computational load and the chance of failure. In this paper, we
present a hybrid Reinforcement Learning (RL) planning framework which is
comprised of an interactive motion planner and a RL task planner. The RL task
planner attempts to choose statistically safe and efficient task sequences
based on the feedback from the motion planner, while the motion planner keeps
the task execution process collision-free by detecting human arm motions and
deploying new paths when the previous path is not valid anymore. Intuitively,
the RL agent will learn to avoid dangerous tasks, while the motion planner
ensures that the chosen tasks are safe. The proposed framework is validated on
the cobot in both simulation and the real world, we compare the planner with
hard-coded task motion planning methods. The results show that our planning
framework can 1) react to uncertain human motions at both joint and task
levels; 2) reduce the times of repeating failed goal commands; 3) reduce the
total number of replanning requests.

Abstract: Pruning is an essential agricultural practice for orchards. Proper pruning
can promote healthier growth and optimize fruit production throughout the
orchard's lifespan. Robot manipulators have been developed as an automated
solution for this repetitive task, which typically requires seasonal labor with
specialized skills. While previous research has primarily focused on the
challenges of perception, the complexities of manipulation are often
overlooked. These challenges involve planning and control in both joint and
Cartesian spaces to guide the end-effector through intricate, obstructive
branches. Our work addresses the behavior planning challenge for a robotic
pruning system, which entails a multi-level planning problem in environments
with complex collisions. In this paper, we formulate the planning problem for a
high-dimensional robotic arm in a pruning scenario, investigate the system's
intrinsic redundancies, and propose a comprehensive pruning workflow that
integrates perception, modeling, and holistic planning. In our experiments, we
demonstrate that more comprehensive planning methods can significantly enhance
the performance of the robotic manipulator. Finally, we implement the proposed
workflow on a real-world robot. As a result, this work complements previous
efforts on robotic pruning and motivates future research and development in
planning for pruning applications.

Conclusion: 该方法专注于物体物理属性感知，增强了人工触觉系统从感知到认知的过渡能力，使其能够在具身感知应用中使用。

Abstract: Tactile perception is crucial for embodied intelligent robots to recognize
objects. Vision-based tactile sensors extract object physical attributes
multidimensionally using high spatial resolution; however, this process
generates abundant redundant information. Furthermore, single-dimensional
extraction, lacking effective fusion, fails to fully characterize object
attributes. These challenges hinder the improvement of recognition accuracy. To
address this issue, this study introduces a two-stream network feature
extraction and fusion perception strategy for vision-based tactile systems.
This strategy employs a distributed approach to extract internal and external
object features. It obtains depth map information through three-dimensional
reconstruction while simultaneously acquiring hardness information by measuring
contact force data. After extracting features with a convolutional neural
network (CNN), weighted fusion is applied to create a more informative and
effective feature representation. In standard tests on objects of varying
shapes and hardness, the force prediction error is 0.06 N (within a 12 N
range). Hardness recognition accuracy reaches 98.0%, and shape recognition
accuracy reaches 93.75%. With fusion algorithms, object recognition accuracy in
actual grasping scenarios exceeds 98.5%. Focused on object physical attributes
perception, this method enhances the artificial tactile system ability to
transition from perception to cognition, enabling its use in embodied
perception applications.

Abstract: In the evolving landscape of high-speed agile quadrotor flight, achieving
precise trajectory tracking at the platform's operational limits is paramount.
Controllers must handle actuator constraints, exhibit robustness to
disturbances, and remain computationally efficient for safety-critical
applications. In this work, we present a novel neural-augmented feedback
controller for agile flight control. The controller addresses individual
limitations of existing state-of-the-art control paradigms and unifies their
strengths. We demonstrate the controller's capabilities, including the accurate
tracking of highly aggressive trajectories that surpass the feasibility of the
actuators. Notably, the controller provides universal stability guarantees,
enhancing its robustness and tracking performance even in exceedingly
disturbance-prone settings. Its nonlinear feedback structure is highly
efficient enabling fast computation at high update rates. Moreover, the
learning process in simulation is both fast and stable, and the controller's
inherent robustness allows direct deployment to real-world platforms without
the need for training augmentations or fine-tuning.

Conclusion: CMAES进化优化策略在最少迭代次数内设计出最优工具，优于其他最先进优化器，控制置信度的引入提升了工具设计的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Prehistoric humans invented stone tools for specialized tasks by not just
maximizing the tool's immediate goal-completion accuracy, but also increasing
their confidence in the tool for later use under similar settings. This factor
contributed to the increased robustness of the tool, i.e., the least
performance deviations under environmental uncertainties. However, the current
autonomous tool design frameworks solely rely on performance optimization,
without considering the agent's confidence in tool use for repeated use. Here,
we take a step towards filling this gap by i) defining an optimization
framework for task-conditioned autonomous hand tool design for robots, where
ii) we introduce a neuro-inspired control confidence term into the optimization
routine that helps the agent to design tools with higher robustness. Through
rigorous simulations using a robotic arm, we show that tools designed with
control confidence as the objective function are more robust to environmental
uncertainties during tool use than a pure accuracy-driven objective. We further
show that adding control confidence to the objective function for tool design
provides a balance between the robustness and goal accuracy of the designed
tools under control perturbations. Finally, we show that our CMAES-based
evolutionary optimization strategy for autonomous tool design outperforms other
state-of-the-art optimizers by designing the optimal tool within the fewest
iterations. Code: https://github.com/ajitham123/Tool_design_control_confidence.

Abstract: We present a novel framework for human-robot \emph{logical} interaction that
enables robots to reliably satisfy (infinite horizon) temporal logic tasks
while effectively collaborating with humans who pursue independent and unknown
tasks. The framework combines two key capabilities: (i) \emph{maximal
adaptation} enables the robot to adjust its strategy \emph{online} to exploit
human behavior for cooperation whenever possible, and (ii) \emph{minimal
tunable feedback} enables the robot to request cooperation by the human online
only when necessary to guarantee progress. This balance minimizes human-robot
interference, preserves human autonomy, and ensures persistent robot task
satisfaction even under conflicting human goals. We validate the approach in a
real-world block-manipulation task with a Franka Emika Panda robotic arm and in
the Overcooked-AI benchmark, demonstrating that our method produces rich,
\emph{emergent} cooperative behaviors beyond the reach of existing approaches,
while maintaining strong formal guarantees.

Abstract: Robotics plays a pivotal role in planetary science and exploration, where
autonomous and reliable systems are crucial due to the risks and challenges
inherent to space environments. The establishment of permanent lunar bases
demands robotic platforms capable of navigating and manipulating in the harsh
lunar terrain. While wheeled rovers have been the mainstay for planetary

proposed framework integrates whole-body locomotion and manipulation
capabilities while explicitly addressing critical safety constraints, including
collision avoidance, dynamic stability, and power efficiency, in order to
ensure robust performance under lunar-specific conditions, such as reduced
gravity and irregular terrain. Experimental results demonstrate the framework's
effectiveness in achieving precise 6D task-space end-effector pose tracking,
achieving an average positional accuracy of 4 cm and orientation accuracy of
8.1 degrees. The system consistently respects both soft and hard constraints,
exhibiting adaptive behaviors optimized for lunar gravity conditions. This work
effectively bridges adaptive learning with essential mission-critical safety
requirements, paving the way for advanced autonomous robotic explorers for
future lunar missions.

*Baicheng Li,Dong Wu,Zike Yan,Xinchen Liu,Zecui Zeng,Lusong Li,Hongbin Zha*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了Reflective Self-Adaptation框架，通过双路径架构实现VLA模型的快速自主任务适应，无需人工干预。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练的视觉-语言-动作模型在适应新任务时效率低下，强化学习过程缓慢，阻碍快速任务掌握。

Method: 采用双路径架构：1）失败驱动反思RL路径，利用VLM因果推理从失败分析中自动合成密集奖励函数；2）成功驱动质量引导SFT路径，选择性地模仿高质量成功轨迹。

Result: 在复杂操作任务实验中，该框架相比基准方法实现了更快的收敛速度和更高的最终成功率。

Conclusion: 该工作提供了一个强大的解决方案，创建能够高效可靠适应新环境的自我改进智能体。

Abstract: Pre-trained Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models represent a major leap
towards general-purpose robots, yet efficiently adapting them to novel,
specific tasks in-situ remains a significant hurdle. While reinforcement
learning (RL) is a promising avenue for such adaptation, the process often
suffers from low efficiency, hindering rapid task mastery. We introduce
Reflective Self-Adaptation, a framework for rapid, autonomous task adaptation
without human intervention. Our framework establishes a self-improving loop
where the agent learns from its own experience to enhance both strategy and
execution.
  The core of our framework is a dual-pathway architecture that addresses the
full adaptation lifecycle. First, a Failure-Driven Reflective RL pathway
enables rapid learning by using the VLM's causal reasoning to automatically
synthesize a targeted, dense reward function from failure analysis. This
provides a focused learning signal that significantly accelerates policy
exploration. However, optimizing such proxy rewards introduces a potential risk
of "reward hacking," where the agent masters the reward function but fails the
actual task. To counteract this, our second pathway, Success-Driven
Quality-Guided SFT, grounds the policy in holistic success. It identifies and
selectively imitates high-quality successful trajectories, ensuring the agent
remains aligned with the ultimate task goal. This pathway is strengthened by a
conditional curriculum mechanism to aid initial exploration.
  We conduct experiments in challenging manipulation tasks. The results
demonstrate that our framework achieves faster convergence and higher final
success rates compared to representative baselines. Our work presents a robust
solution for creating self-improving agents that can efficiently and reliably
adapt to new environments.

*Se Hwan Jeon,Ho Jae Lee,Seungwoo Hong,Sangbae Kim*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种GPU并行化的残差架构，将MPC和RL在力矩控制层面紧密集成，结合了模型预测控制的解释性和约束处理能力与强化学习的适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MPC提供可解释、可调的运动控制器，但鲁棒性受限于模型失配和实时计算约束；RL能产生高度鲁棒行为但缺乏可解释性且需要大量奖励工程。

Method: 开发了运动学全身MPC公式，在100Hz频率下并行评估数千个智能体进行RL训练。残差策略学习对MPC输出进行针对性修正。

Result: 相比独立MPC或端到端RL，该方法实现了更高的样本效率、更大的渐近奖励、更广的可跟踪速度命令范围，并能零样本适应未见步态和不平地形。

Conclusion: 该方法成功结合了基于模型控制的先验知识和RL的适应性，实现了高性能的混合控制架构。

Abstract: Model Predictive Control (MPC) provides interpretable, tunable locomotion
controllers grounded in physical models, but its robustness depends on frequent
replanning and is limited by model mismatch and real-time computational
constraints. Reinforcement Learning (RL), by contrast, can produce highly
robust behaviors through stochastic training but often lacks interpretability,
suffers from out-of-distribution failures, and requires intensive reward
engineering. This work presents a GPU-parallelized residual architecture that
tightly integrates MPC and RL by blending their outputs at the torque-control
level. We develop a kinodynamic whole-body MPC formulation evaluated across
thousands of agents in parallel at 100 Hz for RL training. The residual policy
learns to make targeted corrections to the MPC outputs, combining the
interpretability and constraint handling of model-based control with the
adaptability of RL. The model-based control prior acts as a strong bias,
initializing and guiding the policy towards desirable behavior with a simple
set of rewards. Compared to standalone MPC or end-to-end RL, our approach
achieves higher sample efficiency, converges to greater asymptotic rewards,
expands the range of trackable velocity commands, and enables zero-shot
adaptation to unseen gaits and uneven terrain.

Motivation: 灵巧抓取在机器人学中面临高维状态和动作空间的复杂性挑战，需要开发能够高效生成准确且多样化抓取姿势的方法。

Method: 提出T(R,O)图统一表示法，建模机械手与物体间的空间变换并编码几何属性；结合图扩散模型和高效逆运动学求解器，支持无条件和条件抓取合成。

Result: 在多种灵巧机械手上实验，平均成功率94.83%，推理速度0.21秒，A100 GPU上吞吐量41抓取/秒，显著优于现有基线方法，且内存消耗显著降低。

Conclusion: 该方法具有鲁棒性和泛化能力，高推理速度支持闭环灵巧操作，有潜力成为灵巧抓取的基础模型。

Abstract: Dexterous grasping remains a central challenge in robotics due to the
complexity of its high-dimensional state and action space. We introduce T(R,O)
Grasp, a diffusion-based framework that efficiently generates accurate and
diverse grasps across multiple robotic hands. At its core is the T(R,O) Graph,
a unified representation that models spatial transformations between robotic
hands and objects while encoding their geometric properties. A graph diffusion
model, coupled with an efficient inverse kinematics solver, supports both
unconditioned and conditioned grasp synthesis. Extensive experiments on a
diverse set of dexterous hands show that T(R,O) Grasp achieves average success
rate of 94.83%, inference speed of 0.21s, and throughput of 41 grasps per
second on an NVIDIA A100 40GB GPU, substantially outperforming existing
baselines. In addition, our approach is robust and generalizable across
embodiments while significantly reducing memory consumption. More importantly,
the high inference speed enables closed-loop dexterous manipulation,
underscoring the potential of T(R,O) Grasp to scale into a foundation model for
dexterous grasping.

TL;DR: HYPE是一个混合运动规划器，通过将学习到的多模态轨迹提议作为启发式先验集成到蒙特卡洛树搜索中，简化了成本函数设计，并在复杂城市环境中实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在复杂城市环境中进行安全和可解释的运动规划需要处理双向多智能体交互。现有方法通常需要设计复杂的成本函数来编码期望的车辆行为，这在考虑广泛复杂场景时非常具有挑战性。

Method: 提出HYPE混合规划器，将学习到的多模态轨迹提议作为启发式先验集成到蒙特卡洛树搜索细化中。引入自我条件占用预测模型来建模双向交互，通过提议驱动的指导简化成本函数设计。

Result: 在nuPlan和DeepUrban大规模真实世界基准测试中，HYPE有效实现了最先进的性能，特别是在安全性和适应性方面表现优异。

Conclusion: HYPE通过集成学习到的轨迹提议和简化成本函数设计，成功解决了复杂城市环境中的运动规划问题，证明了其在安全性和适应性方面的优势。

Abstract: Safe and interpretable motion planning in complex urban environments needs to
reason about bidirectional multi-agent interactions. This reasoning requires to
estimate the costs of potential ego driving maneuvers. Many existing planners
generate initial trajectories with sampling-based methods and refine them by
optimizing on learned predictions of future environment states, which requires
a cost function that encodes the desired vehicle behavior. Designing such a
cost function can be very challenging, especially if a wide range of complex
urban scenarios has to be considered. We propose HYPE: HYbrid Planning with Ego
proposal-conditioned predictions, a planner that integrates multimodal
trajectory proposals from a learned proposal model as heuristic priors into a
Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) refinement. To model bidirectional interactions,
we introduce an ego-conditioned occupancy prediction model, enabling
consistent, scene-aware reasoning. Our design significantly simplifies cost
function design in refinement by considering proposal-driven guidance,
requiring only minimalistic grid-based cost terms. Evaluations on large-scale
real-world benchmarks nuPlan and DeepUrban show that HYPE effectively achieves
state-of-the-art performance, especially in safety and adaptability.

### [115] [Think as a Doctor: An Interpretable AI Approach for ICU Mortality Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11745)
*Qingwen Li,Xiaohang Zhao,Xiao Han,Hailiang Huang,Lanjuan Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ProtoDoctor是一个用于ICU死亡率预测的新型框架，通过原型学习实现内在可解释性，整合了临床病程识别、人口统计学异质性和预后意识三个ICU决策实践的关键要素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ICU死亡率预测不仅需要预测准确性，可解释性对于建立临床信任和满足监管标准同样重要。传统方法主要关注人口统计学异质性，忽略了临床病程识别和预后意识。

Method: ProtoDoctor采用两个关键创新模块：预后临床病程识别模块（通过原型学习识别临床病程，使用新型正则化机制实现预后意识）和人口统计学异质性识别模块（通过队列特定原型和风险调整建模人口统计学异质性）。

Result: 广泛的实证评估表明ProtoDoctor在预测准确性方面优于最先进的基线方法。人工评估进一步证实其解释在ICU实践中更具临床意义、可信度和适用性。

Conclusion: ProtoDoctor成功地将ICU决策实践的三个关键要素整合到其推理过程中，在保持高预测准确性的同时提供了临床上有意义的解释，为ICU死亡率预测提供了更全面的解决方案。

Abstract: Intensive Care Unit (ICU) mortality prediction, which estimates a patient's
mortality status at discharge using EHRs collected early in an ICU admission,
is vital in critical care. For this task, predictive accuracy alone is
insufficient; interpretability is equally essential for building clinical trust
and meeting regulatory standards, a topic that has attracted significant
attention in information system research. Accordingly, an ideal solution should
enable intrinsic interpretability and align its reasoning with three key
elements of the ICU decision-making practices: clinical course identification,
demographic heterogeneity, and prognostication awareness. However, conventional
approaches largely focus on demographic heterogeneity, overlooking clinical
course identification and prognostication awareness. Recent prototype learning
methods address clinical course identification, yet the integration of the
other elements into such frameworks remains underexplored. To address these
gaps, we propose ProtoDoctor, a novel ICU mortality prediction framework that
delivers intrinsic interpretability while integrating all three elements of the
ICU decision-making practices into its reasoning process. Methodologically,
ProtoDoctor features two key innovations: the Prognostic Clinical Course
Identification module and the Demographic Heterogeneity Recognition module. The
former enables the identification of clinical courses via prototype learning
and achieves prognostication awareness using a novel regularization mechanism.
The latter models demographic heterogeneity through cohort-specific prototypes
and risk adjustments. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that
ProtoDoctor outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in predictive accuracy.
Human evaluations further confirm that its interpretations are more clinically
meaningful, trustworthy, and applicable in ICU practice.

TL;DR: 提出GAR框架，通过生成对抗强化学习联合训练问题生成器和求解器，在可验证环境中实现问题生成与求解的协同进化


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于固定问题集的在线强化学习训练效率低，限制了模型解决复杂问题的能力

Method: GAR框架包含问题生成器和求解器的对抗训练循环，引入隐式课程学习机制，使任务难度与证明者能力同步演进

Result: 在MiniF2F-Test基准上平均相对提升4.20%，ProofNet-Test上pass@32从22.58%提升至25.81%

Conclusion: GAR建立了可验证环境下问题生成与求解协同进化的一般性强化学习范式

Abstract: Solving math problems through verifiable languages such as Lean has
significantly impacted both the mathematics and computer science communities.
Current state-of-the-art models are often trained with expensive online
Reinforcement Learning (RL) or expert iteration. However, these approaches rely
on fixed problem sets, which causes inefficient training and limits the model
to tackle complex problems. To overcome these limitations, we propose GAR:
Generative Adversarial Reinforcement learning, a comprehensive RL training
framework that jointly trains the problem composer and solver in an adversarial
loop. GAR introduces an implicit curriculum learning mechanism, which aligns
task difficulty with the prover's evolving capability. It thereby improves the
training efficiency and enables stronger performance of proving advanced
theorems. Experiments show that with GAR training, Goedel-Prover-V2-8B and
DeepSeek-Prover-V2-7B achieve an average relative improvement in pass@32 of
4.20% on MiniF2F-Test benchmark, while DeepSeek-Prover-V2's pass@32 on
ProofNet-Test increases from 22.58% to 25.81%. Beyond formal proving, GAR
establishes a general RL paradigm for co-evolution of problem generation and
solving under verifiable environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 节点级异常检测面临结构模式和特征分布多样性的挑战，在欺诈检测、网络安全和推荐系统等领域有重要应用。

Method: 使用欧几里得和双曲空间的图神经网络，结合原始特征和结构特征，通过多图自编码器框架和对比学习目标对齐两个空间的嵌入。

Result: 在四个真实数据集上的实验表明，Janus持续优于浅层和深层基线方法。

Conclusion: 结合多种几何表示为图数据中复杂异常的识别提供了鲁棒有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Node-level anomaly detection (NAD) is challenging due to diverse structural
patterns and feature distributions. As such, NAD is a critical task with
several applications which range from fraud detection, cybersecurity, to
recommendation systems. We introduce Janus, a framework that jointly leverages
Euclidean and Hyperbolic Graph Neural Networks to capture complementary aspects
of node representations. Each node is described by two views, composed by the
original features and structural features derived from random walks and
degrees, then embedded into Euclidean and Hyperbolic spaces. A multi
Graph-Autoencoder framework, equipped with a contrastive learning objective as
regularization term, aligns the embeddings across the Euclidean and Hyperbolic
spaces, highlighting nodes whose views are difficult to reconcile and are thus
likely anomalous. Experiments on four real-world datasets show that Janus
consistently outperforms shallow and deep baselines, empirically demonstrating
that combining multiple geometric representations provides a robust and
effective approach for identifying subtle and complex anomalies in graphs.

TL;DR: 本文提出软约束薛定谔桥问题(SCSBP)，通过用惩罚函数替代硬终端约束来解决经典薛定谔桥问题在实践中的不稳定性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 经典薛定谔桥问题(SBP)强制硬终端约束，在高维或数据稀缺情况下会导致实现不稳定。为解决这一挑战，需要更灵活的方法。

Method: 采用软约束薛定谔桥问题(SCSBP)框架，将终端约束替换为一般惩罚函数，形成更灵活的McKean-Vlasov型随机控制公式。

Result: 证明了所有惩罚水平下最优解的存在性，并证明当惩罚增加时，控制和价值函数以线性速率收敛到经典SBP。

Conclusion: 软约束桥不仅提供了首个定量收敛保证，还揭示了惩罚正则化如何支持鲁棒生成建模、微调和迁移学习。

Abstract: Generative AI can be framed as the problem of learning a model that maps
simple reference measures into complex data distributions, and it has recently
found a strong connection to the classical theory of the Schr\"odinger bridge
problems (SBPs) due partly to their common nature of interpolating between
prescribed marginals via entropy-regularized stochastic dynamics. However, the
classical SBP enforces hard terminal constraints, which often leads to
instability in practical implementations, especially in high-dimensional or
data-scarce regimes. To address this challenge, we follow the idea of the
so-called soft-constrained Schr\"odinger bridge problem (SCSBP), in which the
terminal constraint is replaced by a general penalty function. This relaxation
leads to a more flexible stochastic control formulation of McKean-Vlasov type.
  We establish the existence of optimal solutions for all penalty levels and
prove that, as the penalty grows, both the controls and value functions
converge to those of the classical SBP at a linear rate. Our analysis builds on
Doob's h-transform representations, the stability results of Schr\"odinger
potentials, Gamma-convergence, and a novel fixed-point argument that couples an
optimization problem over the space of measures with an auxiliary entropic
optimal transport problem. These results not only provide the first
quantitative convergence guarantees for soft-constrained bridges but also shed
light on how penalty regularization enables robust generative modeling,
fine-tuning, and transfer learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据影响估计方法在大模型上存在精度低或计算成本高的问题，限制了在数据选择和模型调试等关键应用中的实用性。

Method: 基于训练和测试数据在中间检查点上的损失值以及检查点本身，开发了一种零阶近似方法，无需梯度或逆Hessian计算。

Result: 该方法在估计自影响方面达到更高精度，在估计训练-测试影响方面达到相当或改进的精度，同时显著降低时间和内存开销。

Conclusion: 该方法为分析训练数据如何塑造模型行为提供了可扩展且实用的工具，特别适用于微调后的大型语言模型。

Abstract: A critical aspect of analyzing and improving modern machine learning systems
lies in understanding how individual training examples influence a model's
predictive behavior. Estimating this influence enables critical applications,
including data selection and model debugging; in particular, self-influence,
which quantifies the influence of a training point on itself, has found many
uses in data quality assessment and outlier detection. Existing methods for
measuring data influence, however, are often impractical for large models due
to low accuracy or prohibitive computational costs: most approaches either
provide poor approximations or rely on gradients and inverse-Hessian
computations that remain challenging to scale. In this work, we introduce a
highly efficient zeroth-order approximation for estimating the influence of
training data that requires only a fraction of the time and memory footprint of
prior methods. Notably, our method relies solely on loss values of intermediate
checkpoints on the training and test data, along with the checkpoints
themselves, making it broadly applicable even when the loss function of
interest is non-differentiable. Beyond its computational efficiency, our
approach achieves superior accuracy in estimating self-influence and comparable
or improved accuracy in estimating train-test influence for fine-tuned large
language models, enabling scalable and practical analysis of how training data
shapes model behavior.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通过微调生成模型来降低被安全分类器过滤的概率，但这往往使模型产生靠近分类器决策边界的样本，增加了假阳性和假阴性。

Method: 使用强化学习微调方法，明确引导生成远离分类器的边界区域。

Result: 在越狱和模糊提示基准测试中，Boundary Guidance提高了输出的安全性和实用性，LLM-as-a-Judge评估证实了其有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法在不同模型规模和奖励设计下都表现出鲁棒性，为生成模型的安全优化提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Generative models are increasingly paired with safety classifiers that filter
harmful or undesirable outputs. A common strategy is to fine-tune the generator
to reduce the probability of being filtered, but this can be suboptimal: it
often pushes the model toward producing samples near the classifier's decision
boundary, increasing both false positives and false negatives. We propose
Boundary Guidance, a reinforcement learning fine-tuning method that explicitly
steers generation away from the classifier's margin. On a benchmark of
jailbreak and ambiguous prompts, Boundary Guidance improves both the safety and
the utility of outputs, as judged by LLM-as-a-Judge evaluations. Comprehensive
ablations across model scales and reward designs demonstrate the robustness of
our approach.

TL;DR: WaveletDiff是一个基于小波系数的扩散模型框架，用于生成高质量的时间序列数据，在多个领域的数据集上显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前时间序列生成模型局限于时域或频域，难以复现真实世界时间序列的多尺度结构，且大型高质量时间序列数据集稀缺。

Method: 在扩散模型中直接训练小波系数，结合各分解层的专用transformer和跨层注意力机制，通过自适应门控实现时频尺度间的选择性信息交换，并基于Parseval定理加入能量保持约束。

Result: 在能源、金融和神经科学等六个真实数据集上的测试表明，WaveletDiff在五个不同性能指标上始终优于最先进的时域和频域生成方法，判别分数和Context-FID分数平均比次优基线小3倍。

Conclusion: WaveletDiff通过利用小波变换的多分辨率特性，成功解决了时间序列生成中的多尺度结构复现问题，为时间序列数据增强提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Time series are ubiquitous in many applications that involve forecasting,
classification and causal inference tasks, such as healthcare, finance, audio
signal processing and climate sciences. Still, large, high-quality time series
datasets remain scarce. Synthetic generation can address this limitation;
however, current models confined either to the time or frequency domains
struggle to reproduce the inherently multi-scaled structure of real-world time
series. We introduce WaveletDiff, a novel framework that trains diffusion
models directly on wavelet coefficients to exploit the inherent
multi-resolution structure of time series data. The model combines dedicated
transformers for each decomposition level with cross-level attention mechanisms
that enable selective information exchange between temporal and frequency
scales through adaptive gating. It also incorporates energy preservation
constraints for individual levels based on Parseval's theorem to preserve
spectral fidelity throughout the diffusion process. Comprehensive tests across
six real-world datasets from energy, finance, and neuroscience domains
demonstrate that WaveletDiff consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
time-domain and frequency-domain generative methods on both short and long time
series across five diverse performance metrics. For example, WaveletDiff
achieves discriminative scores and Context-FID scores that are $3\times$
smaller on average than the second-best baseline across all datasets.

Conclusion: 研究为实践者提供了在显著降低训练成本的同时实现强大任务适应的实用指南，通过优化重放比例配置来平衡模型适应性和知识保留。

Abstract: Adapting language models to new tasks through continued pretraining faces a
fundamental trade-off: models must learn new capabilities while avoiding
catastrophic forgetting of existing knowledge. While prior work has studied
synthetic data generation techniques, the optimal replay ratios for balancing
task performance and knowledge retention under computational constraints remain
poorly understood. We present a comprehensive empirical study investigating the
interplay between replay ratio configuration and computational budget when
adapting language models to new tasks. Using the bAbI reasoning tasks as our
target objective, we apply synthetic data generation and systematically
evaluate different total token budgets and replay ratio configurations. We
analyze their effects on both task mastery and general knowledge retention. Our
experiments reveal an optimal configuration that balances task-specific
performance with general knowledge retention. Based on our findings, we provide
empirically-grounded guidelines for selecting replay ratios based on
computational budget, enabling practitioners to achieve strong task adaptation
with significantly reduced training costs.

Conclusion: 开源视觉语言模型在多模态讽刺检测方面显示出潜力，但在解释生成能力上仍有局限，需要进一步的任务特定优化。

Abstract: Recent advances in open-source vision-language models (VLMs) offer new
opportunities for understanding complex and subjective multimodal phenomena
such as sarcasm. In this work, we evaluate seven state-of-the-art VLMs - BLIP2,
InstructBLIP, OpenFlamingo, LLaVA, PaliGemma, Gemma3, and Qwen-VL - on their
ability to detect multimodal sarcasm using zero-, one-, and few-shot prompting.
Furthermore, we evaluate the models' capabilities in generating explanations to
sarcastic instances. We evaluate the capabilities of VLMs on three benchmark
sarcasm datasets (Muse, MMSD2.0, and SarcNet). Our primary objectives are
twofold: (1) to quantify each model's performance in detecting sarcastic
image-caption pairs, and (2) to assess their ability to generate human-quality
explanations that highlight the visual-textual incongruities driving sarcasm.
Our results indicate that, while current models achieve moderate success in
binary sarcasm detection, they are still not able to generate high-quality
explanations without task-specific finetuning.

Result: 结果显示，包含参与者行为的模型在RMSE、MAE和R2指标上始终优于仅包含吞吐时间特征的基线模型。

Conclusion: 将参与者行为随时间建模并将这些信息纳入预测模型能够提高性能指标预测的准确性。

Abstract: Predictive Process Monitoring (PPM) is a key task in Process Mining that aims
to predict future behavior, outcomes, or performance indicators. Accurate
prediction of the latter is critical for proactive decision-making. Given that
processes are often resource-driven, understanding and incorporating actor
behavior in forecasting is crucial. Although existing research has incorporated
aspects of actor behavior, its role as a time-varying signal in PPM remains
limited. This study investigates whether incorporating actor behavior
information, modeled as time series, can improve the predictive performance of
throughput time (TT) forecasting models. Using real-life event logs, we
construct multivariate time series that include TT alongside actor-centric
features, i.e., actor involvement, the frequency of continuation, interruption,
and handover behaviors, and the duration of these behaviors. We train and
compare several models to study the benefits of adding actor behavior. The
results show that actor-enriched models consistently outperform baseline
models, which only include TT features, in terms of RMSE, MAE, and R2. These
findings demonstrate that modeling actor behavior over time and incorporating
this information into forecasting models enhances performance indicator
predictions.

*Rita T. Sousa,Heiko Paulheim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的知识图谱嵌入方法，通过双模型架构整合显式声明的负样本，在训练过程中相互生成负样本，提升了链接预测和三元组分类任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识图谱嵌入方法大多基于封闭世界假设或局部封闭世界假设，将缺失三元组视为假，这与现实世界知识图谱的开放世界假设不符。显式声明的负样本有助于区分假三元组和未知三元组，但很少被包含在知识图谱中且常被忽略。

Method: 采用双模型架构，两个嵌入模型并行训练：一个在正样本上训练，另一个在负样本上训练。训练过程中，每个模型通过破坏正样本并选择另一个模型评分最高的候选作为负样本。

Result: 在通用和领域特定知识图谱上的广泛实验表明，该方法在链接预测和三元组分类任务上优于最先进的嵌入模型。

Conclusion: 将有意义负知识整合到嵌入学习中能显著提升预测性能，证明了负样本在知识图谱嵌入中的价值。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs represent information as structured triples and serve as the
backbone for a wide range of applications, including question answering, link
prediction, and recommendation systems. A prominent line of research for
exploring knowledge graphs involves graph embedding methods, where entities and
relations are represented in low-dimensional vector spaces that capture
underlying semantics and structure. However, most existing methods rely on
assumptions such as the Closed World Assumption or Local Closed World
Assumption, treating missing triples as false. This contrasts with the Open
World Assumption underlying many real-world knowledge graphs. Furthermore,
while explicitly stated negative statements can help distinguish between false
and unknown triples, they are rarely included in knowledge graphs and are often
overlooked during embedding training.
  In this work, we introduce a novel approach that integrates explicitly
declared negative statements into the knowledge embedding learning process. Our
approach employs a dual-model architecture, where two embedding models are
trained in parallel, one on positive statements and the other on negative
statements. During training, each model generates negative samples by
corrupting positive samples and selecting the most likely candidates as scored
by the other model. The proposed approach is evaluated on both general-purpose
and domain-specific knowledge graphs, with a focus on link prediction and
triple classification tasks. The extensive experiments demonstrate that our
approach improves predictive performance over state-of-the-art embedding
models, demonstrating the value of integrating meaningful negative knowledge
into embedding learning.

TL;DR: 提出了CART框架，这是首个增强决策变换器在对抗性随机游戏中鲁棒性的方法，通过将每个阶段的交互建模为阶段博弈，并基于NashQ值来生成策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然Transformer架构已成功应用于序列决策，但基于序列建模的强化学习方法在对抗鲁棒性方面尚未充分探索，特别是在对抗性随机游戏环境中。

Method: 将每个阶段的交互建模为阶段博弈，定义支付函数为后续状态的最大期望值，通过基于阶段博弈NashQ值的Transformer策略生成同时具备对抗鲁棒性和保守性的策略。

Result: 实证结果显示CART在对抗性随机游戏中实现了更准确的极小极大值估计，并在各种环境下持续获得更优的最坏情况回报。

Conclusion: CART框架成功提升了决策变换器在对抗性环境中的鲁棒性，为序列建模强化学习方法在对抗性场景下的应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The Transformer, a highly expressive architecture for sequence modeling, has
recently been adapted to solve sequential decision-making, most notably through
the Decision Transformer (DT), which learns policies by conditioning on desired
returns. Yet, the adversarial robustness of reinforcement learning methods
based on sequence modeling remains largely unexplored. Here we introduce the
Conservative Adversarially Robust Decision Transformer (CART), to our knowledge
the first framework designed to enhance the robustness of DT in adversarial
stochastic games. We formulate the interaction between the protagonist and the
adversary at each stage as a stage game, where the payoff is defined as the
expected maximum value over subsequent states, thereby explicitly incorporating
stochastic state transitions. By conditioning Transformer policies on the NashQ
value derived from these stage games, CART generates policy that are
simultaneously less exploitable (adversarially robust) and conservative to
transition uncertainty. Empirically, CART achieves more accurate minimax value
estimation and consistently attains superior worst-case returns across a range
of adversarial stochastic games.

TL;DR: AdaRL是一个双层优化框架，通过自适应调整策略复杂度来提升强化学习的鲁棒性，避免嵌套min-max优化，在MuJoCo基准测试中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有鲁棒强化学习方法依赖计算昂贵的嵌套min-max优化，导致策略过于保守，需要更高效的方法处理环境动态的不确定性。

Method: 提出AdaRL双层优化框架：下层在固定秩约束下优化策略，上层自适应调整秩以平衡偏差-方差权衡，将策略参数投影到低秩流形上。

Result: 在MuJoCo连续控制基准测试中，AdaRL不仅优于固定秩基线和最先进的鲁棒RL方法，还能收敛到任务的内在秩。

Conclusion: 自适应低秩策略表示为模型不确定性下的鲁棒RL提供了高效且原则性的替代方案。

Abstract: Robust reinforcement learning (Robust RL) seeks to handle epistemic
uncertainty in environment dynamics, but existing approaches often rely on
nested min--max optimization, which is computationally expensive and yields
overly conservative policies. We propose \textbf{Adaptive Rank Representation
(AdaRL)}, a bi-level optimization framework that improves robustness by
aligning policy complexity with the intrinsic dimension of the task. At the
lower level, AdaRL performs policy optimization under fixed-rank constraints
with dynamics sampled from a Wasserstein ball around a centroid model. At the
upper level, it adaptively adjusts the rank to balance the bias--variance
trade-off, projecting policy parameters onto a low-rank manifold. This design
avoids solving adversarial worst-case dynamics while ensuring robustness
without over-parameterization. Empirical results on MuJoCo continuous control
benchmarks demonstrate that AdaRL not only consistently outperforms fixed-rank
baselines (e.g., SAC) and state-of-the-art robust RL methods (e.g., RNAC,
Parseval), but also converges toward the intrinsic rank of the underlying
tasks. These results highlight that adaptive low-rank policy representations
provide an efficient and principled alternative for robust RL under model
uncertainty.

Result: 实验表明模型从结合两种事件类型中受益，但当前方法仍有显著改进空间。

Conclusion: 发布了资源以支持统一用户事件建模的进一步研究，鼓励在这个方向上的进展。

Abstract: User event modeling plays a central role in many machine learning
applications, with use cases spanning e-commerce, social media, finance,
cybersecurity, and other domains. User events can be broadly categorized into
personal events, which involve individual actions, and relational events, which
involve interactions between two users. These two types of events are typically
modeled separately, using sequence-based methods for personal events and
graph-based methods for relational events. Despite the need to capture both
event types in real-world systems, prior work has rarely considered them
together. This is often due to the convenient simplification that user behavior
can be adequately represented by a single formalization, either as a sequence
or a graph. To address this gap, there is a need for public datasets and
prediction tasks that explicitly incorporate both personal and relational
events. In this work, we introduce a collection of such datasets, propose a
unified formalization, and empirically show that models benefit from
incorporating both event types. Our results also indicate that current methods
leave a notable room for improvements. We release these resources to support
further research in unified user event modeling and encourage progress in this
direction.

Motivation: 阿尔茨海默病和额颞叶痴呆等痴呆症在EEG中表现出重叠的电生理特征，现有基于EEG的方法受限于全频段分析，难以精确区分痴呆亚型和严重程度阶段。

Method: VMoGE采用多粒度transformer提取四个频段的多尺度时间模式，然后使用高斯马尔可夫随机场先验的变分图卷积编码器，通过结构化变分推理和自适应门控将神经专业化与生理意义的EEG频段联系起来。

Conclusion: VMoGE为全面痴呆症诊断和监测提供了EEG生物标志物发现的新途径，其专家权重与临床指标相关，空间模式与神经病理学特征一致。

Abstract: Dementia disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal
dementia (FTD) exhibit overlapping electrophysiological signatures in EEG that
challenge accurate diagnosis. Existing EEG-based methods are limited by
full-band frequency analysis that hinders precise differentiation of dementia
subtypes and severity stages. We propose a variational mixture of graph neural
experts (VMoGE) that integrates frequency-specific biomarker identification
with structured variational inference for enhanced dementia diagnosis and
staging. VMoGE employs a multi-granularity transformer to extract multi-scale
temporal patterns across four frequency bands, followed by a variational graph
convolutional encoder using Gaussian Markov Random Field priors. Through
structured variational inference and adaptive gating, VMoGE links neural
specialization to physiologically meaningful EEG frequency bands. Evaluated on
two diverse datasets for both subtype classification and severity staging,
VMoGE achieves superior performance with AUC improvements of +4% to +10% over
state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, VMoGE provides interpretable insights
through expert weights that correlate with clinical indicators and spatial
patterns aligned with neuropathological signatures, facilitating EEG biomarker
discovery for comprehensive dementia diagnosis and monitoring.

TL;DR: Locaris是一种基于解码器大型语言模型的室内定位系统，将Wi-Fi接入点测量视为token，无需预处理即可处理原始Wi-Fi遥测数据，实现校准无关的室内定位。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统室内Wi-Fi定位方法对环境动态、信道传播特性和硬件异构性高度敏感，需要大量人工校准，且在设备、信道或部署条件变化时性能迅速下降。

Method: 通过在不同Wi-Fi数据集上微调LLM，Locaris学习从原始信号到设备位置的轻量级可泛化映射，将每个AP测量视为token进行处理。

Result: 实验表明Locaris在多种遥测类型上达到或超越现有技术，仅需少量校准点即可保持高精度，在缺失AP情况下表现稳健，仅需几百个样本即可实现亚米级精度。

Conclusion: 紧凑型LLM可作为室内定位的校准无关回归模型，在异构Wi-Fi部署中提供可扩展和稳健的跨环境性能，特别适用于大规模部署场景。

Abstract: Indoor Wi-Fi positioning remains a challenging problem due to the high
sensitivity of radio signals to environmental dynamics, channel propagation
characteristics, and hardware heterogeneity. Conventional fingerprinting and
model-based approaches typically require labor-intensive calibration and suffer
rapid performance degradation when devices, channel or deployment conditions
change. In this paper, we introduce Locaris, a decoder-only large language
model (LLM) for indoor localization. Locaris treats each access point (AP)
measurement as a token, enabling the ingestion of raw Wi-Fi telemetry without
pre-processing. By fine-tuning its LLM on different Wi-Fi datasets, Locaris
learns a lightweight and generalizable mapping from raw signals directly to
device location. Our experimental study comparing Locaris with state-of-the-art
methods consistently shows that Locaris matches or surpasses existing
techniques for various types of telemetry. Our results demonstrate that compact
LLMs can serve as calibration-free regression models for indoor localization,
offering scalable and robust cross-environment performance in heterogeneous
Wi-Fi deployments. Few-shot adaptation experiments, using only a handful of
calibration points per device, further show that Locaris maintains high
accuracy when applied to previously unseen devices and deployment scenarios.
This yields sub-meter accuracy with just a few hundred samples, robust
performance under missing APs and supports any and all available telemetry. Our
findings highlight the practical viability of Locaris for indoor positioning in
the real-world scenarios, particularly in large-scale deployments where
extensive calibration is infeasible.

Motivation: 针对Mao等人(2022)的RestartQ-UCB算法存在的两个核心问题：完全遗忘（重启后丢失所有环境信息）和定时重启（不考虑策略与当前环境动态的不兼容性）。

Method: 引入了三种重启方法：部分重启、自适应重启和选择性重启，用于改进RestartQ-UCB和RANDOMIZEDQ算法。

Result: 在多种不同环境中实现了接近最优的实证性能，相对于RestartQ-UCB将动态遗憾降低了高达91%。

Conclusion: 提出的三种重启范式有效解决了非平稳强化学习中的重启设计问题，显著提升了算法性能。

Abstract: In this work, we propose three efficient restart paradigms for model-free
non-stationary reinforcement learning (RL). We identify two core issues with
the restart design of Mao et al. (2022)'s RestartQ-UCB algorithm: (1) complete
forgetting, where all the information learned about an environment is lost
after a restart, and (2) scheduled restarts, in which restarts occur only at
predefined timings, regardless of the incompatibility of the policy with the
current environment dynamics. We introduce three approaches, which we call
partial, adaptive, and selective restarts to modify the algorithms RestartQ-UCB
and RANDOMIZEDQ (Wang et al., 2025). We find near-optimal empirical performance
in multiple different environments, decreasing dynamic regret by up to $91$%
relative to RestartQ-UCB.

Conclusion: 高效可计算性与组合稀疏神经网络表示之间存在深刻联系，这为理解深度学习的能力和优化提供了理论基础。

Abstract: We show that \emph{efficient Turing computability} at any fixed input/output
precision implies the existence of \emph{compositionally sparse}
(bounded-fan-in, polynomial-size) DAG representations and of corresponding
neural approximants achieving the target precision. Concretely: if
$f:[0,1]^d\to\R^m$ is computable in time polynomial in the bit-depths, then for
every pair of precisions $(n,m_{\mathrm{out}})$ there exists a bounded-fan-in
Boolean circuit of size and depth $\poly(n+m_{\mathrm{out}})$ computing the
discretized map; replacing each gate by a constant-size neural emulator yields
a deep network of size/depth $\poly(n+m_{\mathrm{out}})$ that achieves accuracy
$\varepsilon=2^{-m_{\mathrm{out}}}$. We also relate these constructions to
compositional approximation rates

Conclusion: 该工作为表示工程提供了基础工具，为模型可识别性和因果推理开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Learning disentangled representations, where distinct factors of variation
are captured by independent latent variables, is a central goal in machine
learning. The dominant approach has been the Variational Autoencoder (VAE)
framework, which uses a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence penalty to encourage
the latent space to match a factorized Gaussian prior. In this work, however,
we provide direct evidence that this KL-based regularizer is an unreliable
mechanism, consistently failing to enforce the target distribution on the
aggregate posterior. We validate this and quantify the resulting entanglement
using our novel, unsupervised Latent Predictability Score (LPS). To address
this failure, we introduce the Programmable Prior Framework, a method built on
the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD). Our framework allows practitioners to
explicitly sculpt the latent space, achieving state-of-the-art mutual
independence on complex datasets like CIFAR-10 and Tiny ImageNet without the
common reconstruction trade-off. Furthermore, we demonstrate how this
programmability can be used to engineer sophisticated priors that improve
alignment with semantically meaningful features. Ultimately, our work provides
a foundational tool for representation engineering, opening new avenues for
model identifiability and causal reasoning.

Conclusion: Y形生成流通过共享路径和分支结构有效捕捉数据层次结构，提高了生成模型的效率和性能。

Abstract: Modern continuous-time generative models often induce V-shaped transport:
each sample travels independently along nearly straight trajectories from prior
to data, overlooking shared structure. We introduce Y-shaped generative flows,
which move probability mass together along shared pathways before branching to
target-specific endpoints. Our formulation is based on novel velocity-powered
transport cost with a sublinear exponent (between zero and one). this concave
dependence rewards joint and fast mass movement. Practically, we instantiate
the idea in a scalable neural ODE training objective. On synthetic, image, and
biology datasets, Y-flows recover hierarchy-aware structure, improve
distributional metrics over strong flow-based baselines, and reach targets with
fewer integration steps.

Motivation: 扩散模型的预训练过程存在明显的学习速度阶段差异，但之前的后训练加速方法完全忽视了这一特性。

Conclusion: 该方法为更高效和鲁棒的无训练扩散加速提供了新视角，首次明确反映了扩散预训练固有的学习速度变化。

Abstract: Diffusion models are renowned for their generative capabilities, yet their
pretraining processes exhibit distinct phases of learning speed that have been
entirely overlooked in prior post-training acceleration efforts in the
community. In this study, we introduce a novel framework called MosaicDiff that
aligns diffusion pretraining dynamics with post-training sampling acceleration
via trajectory-aware structural pruning. Our approach leverages the observation
that the middle, fast-learning stage of diffusion pretraining requires more
conservative pruning to preserve critical model features, while the early and
later, slow-learning stages benefit from a more aggressive pruning strategy.
This adaptive pruning mechanism is the first to explicitly mirror the inherent
learning speed variations of diffusion pretraining, thereby harmonizing the
model's inner training dynamics with its accelerated sampling process.
Extensive experiments on DiT and SDXL demonstrate that our method achieves
significant speed-ups in sampling without compromising output quality,
outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods by large margins, also
providing a new viewpoint for more efficient and robust training-free diffusion
acceleration.

Conclusion: 为跨领域洞察提供了基础，有助于更广泛地理解Transformer模型。

Abstract: In natural language processing, current methods for understanding
Transformers are successful at identifying intermediate predictions during a
model's inference. However, these approaches function as limited diagnostic
checkpoints, lacking a mathematical framework for mechanistically modeling how
each layer facilitates transitions between these evolving states. This
interpretability gap and past successes of interdisciplinary outlooks inspire
us to turn to physics in search of a descriptive mathematical framework for
Transformers. We observe that language models are intrinsically probabilistic,
an attribute that is echoed in the core postulates of quantum mechanics. This
parallel inspires us to translate insights from this discipline to that of
natural language processing. Towards this objective, we propose QLENS a novel
attempt to develop a physics-based perspective on the Transformer generation
process. Under QLENS, a Transformer is studied by converting its latent
activations into a state vector in a Hilbert space derived from the model's
output units. This state subsequently evolves through hidden layers -
reformulated as unitary operators and analogously defined Hamiltonians - during
inference. The model's final probability distribution is obtained by applying
the Born rule to the end state using a specific measurement operator. To
demonstrate QLENS's potential, we conduct a proof-of-concept by probing a toy
Transformer to investigate the influence of individual layers in a model's
prediction trajectory. We present our work as a foundation for cross-domain
insights to be leveraged towards a broader understanding of Transformers.

Motivation: 传统基于偏好的视觉语言模型微调存在脆弱性问题，错误的负样本会产生无信息梯度，导致训练不稳定。

Method: 两阶段方法：第一阶段使用温和负样本进行监督微调，第二阶段应用带冷却权重的DPO目标，根据负样本的平均token对数概率缩放负项。

Result: CW-DPO在多种VLM任务中表现出更稳定的优化、更好的校准、更高的配对胜率，且收敛步数更少。

Conclusion: 在冷却偏好之前平滑学习动态是鲁棒VLM对齐的简单通用原则。

Abstract: Preference-based finetuning of vision--language models (VLMs) is brittle:
trivially wrong negatives inject uninformative gradients that destabilize
training. We recast alignment as \textbf{learning-dynamics--aware optimization}
and introduce \textbf{Cooling-Weighted DPO (CW-DPO)}, a two-stage recipe that
explicitly models and exploits the training trajectory. \textbf{Stage 1}
performs supervised finetuning with \textbf{gentle negatives}:
\textbf{low-weight smoothed supervision} that regularizes the base policy and
curbs overconfidence without explicit penalties. \textbf{Stage 2} applies a DPO
objective in which the \textbf{negative term is scaled by a cooling weight}
computed from the model's \textbf{average token log-probability} on each
negative, suppressing uninformative gradients from easy or off-distribution
samples while preserving signal from hard negatives. In practice, we emphasize
\textbf{on-policy negatives} and allow \textbf{mixed negatives} by blending a
controllable fraction of dataset negatives to maintain contrast freshness.
Throughout, we instrument training with $\Delta\!\log p$ probes on positives
and negatives as first-class signals for early stopping, curriculum design, and
failure diagnosis. Across diverse VLM tasks, CW-DPO yields \textbf{more stable
optimization}, \textbf{better calibration}, and \textbf{higher pairwise
win-rates} than SFT-only and vanilla DPO, while \textbf{converging in fewer
steps}. Ablations isolate the \textbf{cooling-weight mechanism} as the primary
driver of these gains and show complementary benefits from mixing on-policy and
dataset negatives. Taken together, our results show that \textbf{smoothing
learning dynamics before cooling preferences} is a simple, general principle
for robust VLM alignment.

Abstract: Despite the striking successes of deep neural networks trained with
gradient-based optimization, these methods differ fundamentally from their
biological counterparts. This gap raises key questions about how nature
achieves robust, sample-efficient learning at minimal energy costs and solves
the credit-assignment problem without backpropagation. We take a step toward
bridging contemporary AI and computational neuroscience by studying how neural
dynamics can support fully local, distributed learning that scales to simple
machine-learning benchmarks. Using tools from statistical mechanics, we
identify conditions for the emergence of robust dynamical attractors in random
asymmetric recurrent networks. We derive a closed-form expression for the
number of fixed points as a function of self-coupling strength, and we reveal a
phase transition in their structure: below a critical self-coupling, isolated
fixed points coexist with exponentially many narrow clusters showing the
overlap-gap property; above it, subdominant yet dense and extensive clusters
appear. These fixed points become accessible, including to a simple
asynchronous dynamical rule, after an algorithm-dependent self-coupling
threshold. Building on this analysis, we propose a biologically plausible
algorithm for supervised learning with any binary recurrent network. Inputs are
mapped to fixed points of the dynamics, by relaxing under transient external
stimuli and stabilizing the resulting configurations via local plasticity. We
show that our algorithm can learn an entangled version of MNIST, leverages
depth to develop hierarchical representations and increase hetero-association
capacity, and is applicable to several architectures. Finally, we highlight the
strong connection between algorithm performance and the unveiled phase
transition, and we suggest a cortex-inspired alternative to self-couplings for
its emergence.

*Conor Rowan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究发现，在神经网络训练中使用精确的Hessian矩阵（二阶方法）会导致训练失败，这与使用近似Hessian的准牛顿方法形成对比，揭示了损失函数几何结构的新见解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索二阶优化方法在神经网络训练中的潜力，特别是比较精确Hessian与近似Hessian方法的性能差异。

Method: 在神经网络训练中直接使用精确的Hessian矩阵（二阶导数信息）进行优化，而非传统的准牛顿方法中的Hessian近似。

Result: 使用精确Hessian的神经网络训练可靠地失败，而准牛顿方法却能成功，这表明损失函数景观中可能缺乏局部最小值。

Conclusion: 研究结果挑战了传统观点，表明神经网络损失函数景观可能不像通常认为的那样充满局部最小值，精确曲率信息的使用揭示了非线性离散化的几何特性。

Abstract: Second-order methods are emerging as promising alternatives to standard
first-order optimizers such as gradient descent and ADAM for training neural
networks. Though the advantages of including curvature information in computing
optimization steps have been celebrated in the scientific machine learning
literature, the only second-order methods that have been studied are
quasi-Newton, meaning that the Hessian matrix of the objective function is
approximated. Though one would expect only to gain from using the true Hessian
in place of its approximation, we show that neural network training reliably
fails when relying on exact curvature information. The failure modes provide
insight both into the geometry of nonlinear discretizations as well as the
distribution of stationary points in the loss landscape, leading us to question
the conventional wisdom that the loss landscape is replete with local minima.

TL;DR: 本文对Mamba模型的上下文学习能力进行理论分析，证明其通过测试时特征学习能够高效地从上下文示例中提取相关特征方向，在单索引模型任务上达到与非线性Transformer相当的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mamba作为新提出的线性时间序列模型，虽然计算效率高且实证表现优异，但其底层机制的理论理解仍然有限。本文旨在从理论上分析Mamba的上下文学习能力。

Method: 研究Mamba在低维非线性目标函数任务中的上下文学习能力，特别关注单索引模型y≈g*(⟨β,x⟩)，通过梯度预训练方法分析Mamba的特征提取机制。

Result: 证明Mamba能够通过测试时特征学习高效提取相关特征方向，其测试时样本复杂度优于线性Transformer（表现为核方法），与非线性Transformer相当，能够超越相关统计查询下界并接近信息理论最优速率。

Conclusion: 非线性门控机制是Mamba实现特征提取的关键，这解释了Mamba在保持计算效率的同时实现高性能的根本原因。

Abstract: Mamba, a recently proposed linear-time sequence model, has attracted
significant attention for its computational efficiency and strong empirical
performance. However, a rigorous theoretical understanding of its underlying
mechanisms remains limited. In this work, we provide a theoretical analysis of
Mamba's in-context learning (ICL) capability by focusing on tasks defined by
low-dimensional nonlinear target functions. Specifically, we study in-context
learning of a single-index model $y \approx g_*(\langle \boldsymbol{\beta},
\boldsymbol{x} \rangle)$, which depends on only a single relevant direction
$\boldsymbol{\beta}$, referred to as feature. We prove that Mamba, pretrained
by gradient-based methods, can achieve efficient ICL via test-time feature
learning, extracting the relevant direction directly from context examples.
Consequently, we establish a test-time sample complexity that improves upon
linear Transformers -- analyzed to behave like kernel methods -- and is
comparable to nonlinear Transformers, which have been shown to surpass the
Correlational Statistical Query (CSQ) lower bound and achieve near
information-theoretically optimal rate in previous works. Our analysis reveals
the crucial role of the nonlinear gating mechanism in Mamba for feature
extraction, highlighting it as the fundamental driver behind Mamba's ability to
achieve both computational efficiency and high performance.

Abstract: Generative classifiers, which leverage conditional generative models for
classification, have recently demonstrated desirable properties such as
robustness to distribution shifts. However, recent progress in this area has
been largely driven by diffusion-based models, whose substantial computational
cost severely limits scalability. This exclusive focus on diffusion-based
methods has also constrained our understanding of generative classifiers. In
this work, we propose a novel generative classifier built on recent advances in
visual autoregressive (VAR) modeling, which offers a new perspective for
studying generative classifiers. To further enhance its performance, we
introduce the Adaptive VAR Classifier$^+$ (A-VARC$^+$), which achieves a
superior trade-off between accuracy and inference speed, thereby significantly
improving practical applicability. Moreover, we show that the VAR-based method
exhibits fundamentally different properties from diffusion-based methods. In
particular, due to its tractable likelihood, the VAR-based classifier enables
visual explainability via token-wise mutual information and demonstrates
inherent resistance to catastrophic forgetting in class-incremental learning
tasks.

Result: 在SleepEDF-20和MASS公开睡眠分期基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法持续优于最先进方法。

Conclusion: MEASURE框架通过有效减少领域相关信息同时保留关键特征，显著提升了睡眠分期模型的领域泛化能力。

Abstract: Deep learning-based automatic sleep staging has significantly advanced in
performance and plays a crucial role in the diagnosis of sleep disorders.
However, those models often struggle to generalize on unseen subjects due to
variability in physiological signals, resulting in degraded performance in
out-of-distribution scenarios. To address this issue, domain generalization
approaches have recently been studied to ensure generalized performance on
unseen domains during training. Among those techniques, contrastive learning
has proven its validity in learning domain-invariant features by aligning
samples of the same class across different domains. Despite its potential, many
existing methods are insufficient to extract adequately domain-invariant
representations, as they do not explicitly address domain characteristics
embedded within the unshared information across samples. In this paper, we
posit that mitigating such domain-relevant attributes-referred to as excess
domain-relevant information-is key to bridging the domain gap. However, the
direct strategy to mitigate the domain-relevant attributes often overfits
features at the high-level information, limiting their ability to leverage the
diverse temporal and spectral information encoded in the multiple feature
levels. To address these limitations, we propose a novel MEASURE (Multi-scalE
minimAl SUfficient Representation lEarning) framework, which effectively
reduces domain-relevant information while preserving essential temporal and
spectral features for sleep stage classification. In our exhaustive experiments
on publicly available sleep staging benchmark datasets, SleepEDF-20 and MASS,
our proposed method consistently outperformed state-of-the-art methods. Our
code is available at : https://github.com/ku-milab/Measure

Motivation: 现有训练数据归因方法将样本间影响力视为静态，但神经网络学习过程存在不同阶段，影响力模式会动态变化。

Method: 基于奇异学习理论构建分阶段数据归因框架，通过玩具模型和语言模型验证影响力动态变化。

Result: 验证了影响力非单调变化（包括符号翻转和峰值），在玩具模型中显示影响力动态变化与语义层次学习直接相关，在语言模型中与已知发展阶段对齐。

Conclusion: 神经网络学习过程中样本影响力是动态变化的，分阶段归因框架能更好地揭示学习机制。

Abstract: Current training data attribution (TDA) methods treat the influence one
sample has on another as static, but neural networks learn in distinct stages
that exhibit changing patterns of influence. In this work, we introduce a
framework for stagewise data attribution grounded in singular learning theory.
We predict that influence can change non-monotonically, including sign flips
and sharp peaks at developmental transitions. We first validate these
predictions analytically and empirically in a toy model, showing that dynamic
shifts in influence directly map to the model's progressive learning of a
semantic hierarchy. Finally, we demonstrate these phenomena at scale in
language models, where token-level influence changes align with known
developmental stages.

TL;DR: GraphShaper是一个几何感知的图基础模型框架，通过多几何专业化增强图编码，解决了当前方法在结构边界处性能显著下降的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法假设所有图结构都能在单一欧几里得空间中编码，但实际上树结构需要双曲几何来保持层次分支，而循环模式依赖球形几何的闭合特性。在结构边界处，节点面临冲突的几何约束，导致性能下降超过20个百分点。

Method: GraphShaper采用针对不同几何空间的专家网络，动态计算融合权重，根据局部结构特征自适应地整合几何特性，在文本嵌入对齐前保持结构完整性。

Result: 在零样本设置下，GraphShaper在引文网络上实现了9.47%的准确率提升，在社交网络上实现了7.63%的准确率提升。

Conclusion: GraphShaper证明了通过尊重图结构内在几何多样性的对齐框架设计，能够有效解决结构边界处的性能退化问题，显著提升图基础模型的性能。

Abstract: Graph foundation models represent a transformative paradigm for learning
transferable representations across diverse graph domains. Recent methods
leverage large language models to unify graph and text modalities into a shared
representation space using contrastive learning. However, systematic
evaluations reveal significant performance degradation at structural boundaries
where distinct topological patterns converge, with accuracy losses exceeding 20
percentage points. This issue arises from a key limitation: current methods
assume all graph structures can be encoded within a single Euclidean space. In
reality, tree structures require hyperbolic geometry to preserve hierarchical
branching, while cyclic patterns depend on spherical geometry for closure
properties. At structural boundaries, nodes experience conflicting geometric
constraints that uniform encoding spaces cannot resolve. This raises a crucial
challenge: \textbf{Can alignment frameworks be designed to respect the
intrinsic geometric diversity of graph structures?} We introduce
\textbf{GraphShaper}, a geometry-aware framework that enhances graph encoding
through multi-geometric specialization. Our approach employs expert networks
tailored to different geometric spaces, dynamically computing fusion weights to
adaptively integrate geometric properties based on local structural
characteristics. This adaptive fusion preserves structural integrity before
alignment with text embeddings. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
GraphShaper achieves 9.47\% accuracy improvements on citation networks and
7.63\% on social networks in zero-shot settings.

Conclusion: 半径减小能够实现忠实的多尺度表示，从而推动零样本图学习的进步。

Abstract: Text-attributed graphs are widely used across domains, offering rich
opportunities for zero-shot learning via graph-text alignment. However,
existing methods struggle with tasks requiring fine-grained pattern
recognition, particularly on heterophilic graphs. Through empirical and
theoretical analysis, we identify an \textbf{over-abstraction problem}: current
approaches operate at excessively large hyperbolic radii, compressing
multi-scale structural information into uniform high-level abstractions. This
abstraction-induced information loss obscures critical local patterns essential
for accurate predictions. By analyzing embeddings in hyperbolic space, we
demonstrate that optimal graph learning requires \textbf{faithful preservation}
of fine-grained structural details, better retained by representations
positioned closer to the origin. To address this, we propose \textbf{H4G}, a
framework that systematically reduces embedding radii using learnable
block-diagonal scaling matrices and M\"obius matrix multiplication. This
approach restores access to fine-grained patterns while maintaining global
receptive ability with minimal computational overhead. Experiments show H4G
achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance with \textbf{12.8\%}
improvement on heterophilic graphs and \textbf{8.4\%} on homophilic graphs,
confirming that radius reduction enables faithful multi-scale representation
for advancing zero-shot graph learning.

TL;DR: 该论文提出模块特定训练(MST)框架，通过动态稀疏训练策略解决深度强化学习中模型规模扩大导致的性能下降问题，显著提升了不同RL算法的可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度强化学习中，模型规模扩大往往导致性能下降，这是由于优化病理如可塑性损失造成的。现有动态训练方法存在三个关键局限：对所有模块应用统一策略、评估基础架构不足、缺乏不同动态方法的系统比较。

Method: 通过跨模块和架构的全面调查，开发了模块特定训练(MST)框架，结合动态稀疏训练策略（包括稀疏到稀疏、稠密到稀疏、稀疏到稠密），针对编码器、评论家和行动者等不同模块采用特定训练方法。

Result: 研究发现动态稀疏训练策略提供模块特定效益，与架构改进形成互补。MST框架在不修改算法的情况下，显著提升了各种RL算法的可扩展性。

Conclusion: 动态稀疏训练策略与架构改进相结合，为深度强化学习的可扩展性提供了有效解决方案，MST框架展示了在多样化RL算法中的实质性可扩展性增益。

Abstract: Scaling neural networks has driven breakthrough advances in machine learning,
yet this paradigm fails in deep reinforcement learning (DRL), where larger
models often degrade performance due to unique optimization pathologies such as
plasticity loss. While recent works show that dynamically adapting network
topology during training can mitigate these issues, existing studies have three
critical limitations: (1) applying uniform dynamic training strategies across
all modules despite encoder, critic, and actor following distinct learning
paradigms, (2) focusing evaluation on basic architectures without clarifying
the relative importance and interaction between dynamic training and
architectural improvements, and (3) lacking systematic comparison between
different dynamic approaches including sparse-to-sparse, dense-to-sparse, and
sparse-to-dense. Through comprehensive investigation across modules and
architectures, we reveal that dynamic sparse training strategies provide
module-specific benefits that complement the primary scalability foundation
established by architectural improvements. We finally distill these insights
into Module-Specific Training (MST), a practical framework that further
exploits the benefits of architectural improvements and demonstrates
substantial scalability gains across diverse RL algorithms without algorithmic
modifications.

TL;DR: Chimera是一个统一模型，通过状态空间模型直接融入数据拓扑结构，无需领域特定偏置，在语言、视觉和图领域均表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Transformer方法依赖自注意力机制，将数据视为无序集合，忽略了数据的邻域结构或图拓扑，需要设计领域特定的偏置（如位置嵌入、随机游走）来融入拓扑结构，但这需要大量工作且可能引入副作用。

Method: 将状态空间模型（自然不需要位置嵌入）推广到捕获任意图拓扑，并提出算法优化：对于有向无环图可实现线性时间递归，对于一般图通过数学松弛达到Transformer的二次复杂度。

Result: 在GLUE上比BERT高0.7分，在ImageNet-1k上比ViT高2.6%，在Long Range Graph Benchmark上优于所有基线方法。

Conclusion: 验证了Chimera的核心贡献，支持数据拓扑是跨模态的强大归纳偏置这一观点。

Abstract: Transformer-based deep learning methods have become the standard approach for
modeling diverse data such as sequences, images, and graphs. These methods rely
on self-attention, which treats data as an unordered set of elements. This
ignores the neighborhood structure or graph topology of the data and requires
inductive biases--such as position embeddings in sequences and images, or
random walks in graphs--to incorporate topology. However, designing such
task-specific biases requires significant effort and can introduce side effects
that hinder generalization. We introduce Chimera, a unified model that directly
incorporates data topology in a principled way, removing the need for
domain-specific biases. The key idea is that state space models--which
naturally do not require position embeddings--can be generalized to capture any
graph topology. Our experiments show that Chimera achieves strong performance
across language, vision, and graph domains, outperforming BERT on GLUE by 0.7
points, ViT on ImageNet-1k by 2.6%, and all baselines on the Long Range Graph
Benchmark. We further propose algorithmic optimizations to improve Chimera's
efficiency: (1) for Directed Acyclic Graphs, Chimera can be implemented as a
linear-time recurrence; (2) for general graphs, a simple mathematical
relaxation achieves Transformer's quadratic complexity without domain-specific
heuristics. These results validate Chimera's core contribution and support the
idea that data topology is a powerful inductive bias across modalities.

Motivation: 解决高斯过程回归训练计算成本高的问题，特别是在大规模数据集上的应用受限。

Conclusion: nuGPR通过数值线性代数技术和GPU并行化，为高斯过程回归提供了高效且内存友好的训练框架。

Abstract: Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) is an important type of supervised machine
learning model with inherent uncertainty measure in its predictions. We propose
a new framework, nuGPR, to address the well-known challenge of high computation
cost associated with GPR training. Our framework includes several ideas from
numerical linear algebra to reduce the amount of computation in key steps of
GPR, and we combine them to establish an end-to-end training algorithm.
Specifically, we leverage the preconditioned conjugate gradient method to
accelerate the convergence of the linear solves required in GPR. We exploit
clustering in the input data to identify block-diagonal structure of the
covariance matrix and subsequently construct low-rank approximations of the
off-diagonal blocks. These enhancements significantly reduce the time and space
complexity of our computations. In addition, unlike other frameworks that rely
on exact differentiation, we employ numerical gradients to optimize the
hyperparameters of our GPR model, further reducing the training cost by
eliminating the need for backpropagation. Lastly, we leverage the CUDA Toolkit
to efficiently parallelize the training procedure on NVIDIA GPUs. As a result,
nuGPR reduces total training time by up to 2x and peak memory consumption by up
to 12x on various synthetic and real-world datasets when compared to the best
existing GPU-based GPR implementation.

Abstract: Graph few-shot learning has attracted increasing attention due to its ability
to rapidly adapt models to new tasks with only limited labeled nodes. Despite
the remarkable progress made by existing graph few-shot learning methods,
several key limitations remain. First, most current approaches rely on
predefined and unified graph filters (e.g., low-pass or high-pass filters) to
globally enhance or suppress node frequency signals. Such fixed spectral
operations fail to account for the heterogeneity of local topological
structures inherent in real-world graphs. Moreover, these methods often assume
that the support and query sets are drawn from the same distribution. However,
under few-shot conditions, the limited labeled data in the support set may not
sufficiently capture the complex distribution of the query set, leading to
suboptimal generalization. To address these challenges, we propose GRACE, a
novel Graph few-shot leaRning framework that integrates Adaptive spectrum
experts with Cross-sEt distribution calibration techniques. Theoretically, the
proposed approach enhances model generalization by adapting to both local
structural variations and cross-set distribution calibration. Empirically,
GRACE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across a wide range
of experimental settings. Our code can be found here.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a privacy-preserving machine learning technique
that facilitates collaboration among participants across demographics. FL
enables model sharing, while restricting the movement of data. Since FL
provides participants with independence over their training data, it becomes
susceptible to poisoning attacks. Such collaboration also propagates bias among
the participants, even unintentionally, due to different data distribution or
historical bias present in the data. This paper proposes an intentional
fairness attack, where a client maliciously sends a biased model, by increasing
the fairness loss while training, even considering homogeneous data
distribution. The fairness loss is calculated by solving an optimization
problem for fairness metrics such as demographic parity and equalized odds. The
attack is insidious and hard to detect, as it maintains global accuracy even
after increasing the bias. We evaluate our attack against the state-of-the-art
Byzantine-robust and fairness-aware aggregation schemes over different
datasets, in various settings. The empirical results demonstrate the attack
efficacy by increasing the bias up to 90\%, even in the presence of a single
malicious client in the FL system.

Motivation: 在现实世界的数据收集中，对删失患者的随访并不总是能导致未删失，且学习者模型在数据收集过程中获得的信息量取决于预算和数据本身的性质。因此需要探索在生存数据集背景下的预算学习问题。

Result: 该方法提供了与标准主动学习方法BatchBALD渐近等效的边界和时间复杂度。在多个生存任务上的实证分析表明，该模型在多个基准测试中优于其他潜在方法。

Conclusion: 论文成功地将预算学习框架扩展到生存数据领域，提供了一种有效的处理删失数据的方法，在理论和实验层面都取得了良好结果。

Abstract: Standard supervised learners attempt to learn a model from a labeled dataset.
Given a small set of labeled instances, and a pool of unlabeled instances, a
budgeted learner can use its given budget to pay to acquire the labels of some
unlabeled instances, which it can then use to produce a model. Here, we explore
budgeted learning in the context of survival datasets, which include (right)
censored instances, where we know only a lower bound on an instance's
time-to-event. Here, that learner can pay to (partially) label a censored
instance -- e.g., to acquire the actual time for an instance [perhaps go from
(3 yr, censored) to (7.2 yr, uncensored)], or other variants [e.g., learn about
one more year, so go from (3 yr, censored) to either (4 yr, censored) or
perhaps (3.2 yr, uncensored)]. This serves as a model of real world data
collection, where follow-up with censored patients does not always lead to
uncensoring, and how much information is given to the learner model during data
collection is a function of the budget and the nature of the data itself. We
provide both experimental and theoretical results for how to apply
state-of-the-art budgeted learning algorithms to survival data and the
respective limitations that exist in doing so. Our approach provides bounds and
time complexity asymptotically equivalent to the standard active learning
method BatchBALD. Moreover, empirical analysis on several survival tasks show
that our model performs better than other potential approaches on several
benchmarks.

Method: 设计最小化推理框架支持小型transformer的基本自我验证反思，避免自然语言使用以确保分析清晰度；理论上证明当验证误差有界时自我验证能保证改进。

Result: 仅几百万参数的小型transformer在训练和反思执行中受益于自我验证，在整数乘法和数独任务中达到显著LLM级别性能；强化学习主要优化浅层统计模式而非真正减少验证误差。

Conclusion: 生成式transformer与判别式验证的结合本质上促进了思维链推理，与模型规模和自然语言无关。

Abstract: Advanced large language models (LLMs) frequently reflect in reasoning
chain-of-thoughts (CoTs), where they self-verify the correctness of current
solutions and explore alternatives. However, given recent findings that LLMs
detect limited errors in CoTs, how reflection contributes to empirical
improvements remains unclear. To analyze this issue, in this paper, we present
a minimalistic reasoning framework to support basic self-verifying reflection
for small transformers without natural language, which ensures analytic clarity
and reduces the cost of comprehensive experiments. Theoretically, we prove that
self-verifying reflection guarantees improvements if verification errors are
properly bounded. Experimentally, we show that tiny transformers, with only a
few million parameters, benefit from self-verification in both training and
reflective execution, reaching remarkable LLM-level performance in integer
multiplication and Sudoku. Similar to LLM results, we find that reinforcement
learning (RL) improves in-distribution performance and incentivizes frequent
reflection for tiny transformers, yet RL mainly optimizes shallow statistical
patterns without faithfully reducing verification errors. In conclusion,
integrating generative transformers with discriminative verification inherently
facilitates CoT reasoning, regardless of scaling and natural language.

*Yiming Zhang,Chester Holtz,Gal Mishne,Alex Cloninger*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文对元学习样本重加权方法在标签噪声下的训练动态进行了理论分析，揭示了其三个训练阶段，并提出了一种轻量级替代方法，在噪声标签基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有元学习样本重加权方法虽然能利用干净子集指导训练来缓解标签噪声问题，但其行为和训练动态缺乏理论理解，需要深入分析其工作机制。

Method: 首先对元重加权方法进行严格理论分析，揭示其三个训练阶段；然后基于分析提出轻量级替代方法，集成均值中心化、行偏移和标签符号调制，避免昂贵的双层优化。

Result: 在合成和真实噪声标签基准测试中，提出的方法持续优于强重加权/选择基线方法，获得更稳定的性能。

Conclusion: 元重加权的训练动态可分为对齐、过滤和后过滤三个阶段，其机制依赖于训练信号与干净子集信号的相似性加权耦合；提出的轻量级替代方法在保持性能的同时显著降低了计算成本。

Abstract: Learning with noisy labels remains challenging because over-parameterized
networks memorize corrupted supervision. Meta-learning-based sample reweighting
mitigates this by using a small clean subset to guide training, yet its
behavior and training dynamics lack theoretical understanding. We provide a
rigorous theoretical analysis of meta-reweighting under label noise and show
that its training trajectory unfolds in three phases: (i) an alignment phase
that amplifies examples consistent with a clean subset and suppresses
conflicting ones; (ii) a filtering phase driving noisy example weights toward
zero until the clean subset loss plateaus; and (iii) a post-filtering phase in
which noise filtration becomes perturbation-sensitive. The mechanism is a
similarity-weighted coupling between training and clean subset signals together
with clean subset training loss contraction; in the post-filtering regime where
the clean-subset loss is sufficiently small, the coupling term vanishes and
meta-reweighting loses discriminatory power. Guided by this analysis, we
propose a lightweight surrogate for meta-reweighting that integrates
mean-centering, row shifting, and label-signed modulation, yielding more stable
performance while avoiding expensive bi-level optimization. Across synthetic
and real noisy-label benchmarks, our method consistently outperforms strong
reweighting/selection baselines.

TL;DR: 提出DE3S方法用于医疗早期时间序列分类，通过双增强软形状学习框架精确识别shapelets，解决准确性和及时性之间的冲突。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗应用中的早期时间序列分类至关重要，如ICU中的脓毒症预测，延迟预测会导致大量死亡。现有方法在准确性和及时性之间存在权衡，难以捕捉早期微弱信号和类别不平衡问题。

Method: 采用双增强软形状学习框架，包括：(1)传统时间增强与基于注意力的全局时间增强相结合的双增强策略；(2)基于注意力分数的软shapelet稀疏化机制；(3)双路径MoE和Inception模块融合架构。

Result: 在六个真实医疗数据集上的广泛实验显示达到了最先进的性能，消融研究确认了各组件有效性。

Conclusion: DE3S方法在医疗早期时间序列分类中表现出色，能够有效平衡准确性和及时性，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Early time-series classification (ETSC) in medical applications is crucial
for time-sensitive scenarios such as sepsis prediction in intensive care units
(ICUs), where a large number of deaths are caused by delayed prediction. ETSC
can significantly improve ICU resource utilization efficiency and healthcare
precision. However, it faces conflicting goals of accuracy and earliness, with
existing methods often trading one for the other, struggling to capture subtle
early-stage patterns due to weak initial signals and class imbalance. The key
to solve these challenges is to find shapelets, which are discriminative
subsequences (or shapes) with high interpretability in time-series
classification. This paper proposes Dual-Enhanced Soft-Sparse-Shape Learning
for Medical Early Time-Series Classification (DE3S), which introduces a novel
Dual-Enhanced Soft-Shape Learning framework to figure out shapelets precisely
through three innovations: (1) a comprehensive dual-enhancement strategy
combines traditional temporal augmentation with attention-based global temporal
enhancement for robust representation learning, (2) an attention-score-based
soft shapelet sparsification mechanism dynamically preserves discriminative
patterns while aggregating less important shapelets into representative tokens,
and (3) a dual-path Mixture of Experts Network (MoE) and Inception modules
fusion architecture where MoE performs local learning within shapelets and
multi-scale Inception modules capture global patterns across shapelets. The
framework employs weighted cross-entropy loss for class imbalance handling and
demonstrates robustness on subject-consistency datasets. Extensive experiments
on six real-world medical datasets show state-of-the-art performance, with
ablation studies confirming component efficacy.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Hierarchical Koopman Diffusion的新框架，通过Koopman算子理论将非线性扩散动力学提升到潜在空间，实现一步采样和可解释的生成轨迹。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型虽然能生成高质量图像，但采样速度慢。现有的一步方法虽然加速了推理，但牺牲了扩散动力学的可解释性和精细控制能力。

Method: 基于Koopman算子理论，将非线性扩散动力学映射到潜在空间，使用全局线性算子控制演化过程。设计了分层架构，通过尺度特定的Koopman子空间在多分辨率上解耦生成动态。

Result: 该方法不仅实现了具有竞争力的一步生成性能，还通过谱分析提供了理解和操作生成过程的原则性机制。

Conclusion: 该框架弥合了扩散模型中快速采样和可解释性之间的差距，为生成建模中的可解释图像合成铺平了道路。

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved impressive success in high-fidelity image
generation but suffer from slow sampling due to their inherently iterative
denoising process. While recent one-step methods accelerate inference by
learning direct noise-to-image mappings, they sacrifice the interpretability
and fine-grained control intrinsic to diffusion dynamics, key advantages that
enable applications like editable generation. To resolve this dichotomy, we
introduce \textbf{Hierarchical Koopman Diffusion}, a novel framework that
achieves both one-step sampling and interpretable generative trajectories.
Grounded in Koopman operator theory, our method lifts the nonlinear diffusion
dynamics into a latent space where evolution is governed by globally linear
operators, enabling closed-form trajectory solutions. This formulation not only
eliminates iterative sampling but also provides full access to intermediate
states, allowing manual intervention during generation. To model the
multi-scale nature of images, we design a hierarchical architecture that
disentangles generative dynamics across spatial resolutions via scale-specific
Koopman subspaces, capturing coarse-to-fine details systematically. We
empirically show that the Hierarchical Koopman Diffusion not only achieves
competitive one-step generation performance but also provides a principled
mechanism for interpreting and manipulating the generative process through
spectral analysis. Our framework bridges the gap between fast sampling and
interpretability in diffusion models, paving the way for explainable image
synthesis in generative modeling.

<details>

Motivation: Graph-LLMs结合图神经网络和大语言模型增强了节点表示能力，但也引入了新的安全漏洞。现有攻击方法只针对结构或文本单一维度，缺乏统一的综合攻击框架

Method: IMDGA框架包含三个紧密集成的模块，在保持可解释性的同时，对图结构和文本特征进行多层级扰动，实现平衡攻击效果和可理解性的对抗攻击

Result: 通过理论分析和多数据集、多架构的实证评估，IMDGA在可解释性、攻击效果、隐蔽性和鲁棒性方面优于现有方法

Conclusion: 这项工作揭示了Graph-LLMs中先前未被充分探索的语义维度漏洞，为提升其抗攻击能力提供了重要见解

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become a pivotal framework for modeling
graph-structured data, enabling a wide range of applications from social
network analysis to molecular chemistry. By integrating large language models
(LLMs), text-attributed graphs (TAGs) enhance node representations with rich
textual semantics, significantly boosting the expressive power of graph-based
learning. However, this sophisticated synergy introduces critical
vulnerabilities, as Graph-LLMs are susceptible to adversarial attacks on both
their structural topology and textual attributes. Although specialized attack
methods have been designed for each of these aspects, no work has yet unified
them into a comprehensive approach. In this work, we propose the Interpretable
Multi-Dimensional Graph Attack (IMDGA), a novel human-centric adversarial
attack framework designed to orchestrate multi-level perturbations across both
graph structure and textual features. IMDGA utilizes three tightly integrated
modules to craft attacks that balance interpretability and impact, enabling a
deeper understanding of Graph-LLM vulnerabilities. Through rigorous theoretical
analysis and comprehensive empirical evaluations on diverse datasets and
architectures, IMDGA demonstrates superior interpretability, attack
effectiveness, stealthiness, and robustness compared to existing methods. By
exposing critical weaknesses in TAG representation learning, this work uncovers
a previously underexplored semantic dimension of vulnerability in Graph-LLMs,
offering valuable insights for improving their resilience. Our code and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理分子图结构时存在两个主要限制：(1) 优化所有分子输入的共享参数空间，限制了模型捕捉实例特定结构特征的能力；(2) 为分子任务微调LLM会导致灾难性遗忘，削弱其通用推理能力。

Method: MoRA为每个输入分子图生成独特的低秩适配权重，这些权重动态注入到冻结的LLM中，使模型能够适应每个分子输入的结构，同时保留LLM的核心知识。

Result: 在关键分子任务上，MoRA的实例特定动态适配优于静态适配基线，包括化学反应预测的精确匹配相对提升14.1%，量子性质预测误差减少22%。

Conclusion: MoRA通过实例特定的动态适配方法，有效解决了分子图结构与LLM集成中的关键挑战，在保持LLM通用推理能力的同时提升了分子任务的性能。

Abstract: Effectively integrating molecular graph structures with Large Language Models
(LLMs) is a key challenge in drug discovery. Most existing multi-modal
alignment methods typically process these structures by fine-tuning the LLM or
adding a static adapter simultaneously. However, these approaches have two main
limitations: (1) it optimizes a shared parameter space across all molecular
inputs, limiting the model's ability to capture instance-specific structural
features; and (2) fine-tuning the LLM for molecular tasks can lead to
catastrophic forgetting, undermining its general reasoning capabilities. In
this paper, instead of static task-oriented adaptation, we propose an
instance-specific parameter space alignment approach for each molecule
on-the-fly. To this end, we introduce Molecule-aware Low-Rank Adaptation (MoRA)
that produces a unique set of low-rank adaptation weights for each input
molecular graph. These weights are then dynamically injected into a frozen LLM,
allowing the model to adapt its reasoning to the structure of each molecular
input, while preserving the LLM's core knowledge. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that on key molecular tasks, such as chemical reaction prediction
and molecular captioning, MoRA's instance-specific dynamic adaptation
outperforms statically adapted baselines, including a 14.1% relative
improvement in reaction prediction exact match and a 22% reduction in error for
quantum property prediction. The code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了在高维岭回归中正则化如何应对执行性效应，发现执行性效应在过参数化情况下可能有益，最优正则化强度应与执行性效应强度成正比。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在执行性学习中，数据分布会因部署的模型而改变（如策略性用户调整特征），这比传统监督学习更复杂。需要同时优化当前数据和考虑模型可能引发的分布变化。

Method: 通过高维岭回归分析正则化对执行性效应的影响，在过参数化情况下研究正则化的作用，并在合成和真实数据集上进行实证评估。

Result: 执行性效应在总体设置下会恶化测试风险，但在过参数化情况下可能有益。最优正则化强度与执行性效应强度成正比，可以提前设置正则化来应对这种效应。

Conclusion: 正则化是应对执行性效应的有效工具，特别是在过参数化情况下，通过适当设置正则化强度可以改善模型性能。

Abstract: In performative learning, the data distribution reacts to the deployed model
- for example, because strategic users adapt their features to game it - which
creates a more complex dynamic than in classical supervised learning. One
should thus not only optimize the model for the current data but also take into
account that the model might steer the distribution in a new direction, without
knowing the exact nature of the potential shift. We explore how regularization
can help cope with performative effects by studying its impact in
high-dimensional ridge regression. We show that, while performative effects
worsen the test risk in the population setting, they can be beneficial in the
over-parameterized regime where the number of features exceeds the number of
samples. We show that the optimal regularization scales with the overall
strength of the performative effect, making it possible to set the
regularization in anticipation of this effect. We illustrate this finding
through empirical evaluations of the optimal regularization parameter on both
synthetic and real-world datasets.

Abstract: Diffusion Models (DMs), as a leading class of generative models, offer key
advantages for reinforcement learning (RL), including multi-modal
expressiveness, stable training, and trajectory-level planning. This survey
delivers a comprehensive and up-to-date synthesis of diffusion-based RL. We
first provide an overview of RL, highlighting its challenges, and then
introduce the fundamental concepts of DMs, investigating how they are
integrated into RL frameworks to address key challenges in this research field.
We establish a dual-axis taxonomy that organizes the field along two orthogonal
dimensions: a function-oriented taxonomy that clarifies the roles DMs play
within the RL pipeline, and a technique-oriented taxonomy that situates
implementations across online versus offline learning regimes. We also provide
a comprehensive examination of this progression from single-agent to
multi-agent domains, thereby forming several frameworks for DM-RL integration
and highlighting their practical utility. Furthermore, we outline several
categories of successful applications of diffusion-based RL across diverse
domains, discuss open research issues of current methodologies, and highlight
key directions for future research to advance the field. Finally, we summarize
the survey to identify promising future development directions. We are actively
maintaining a GitHub repository (https://github.com/ChangfuXu/D4RL-FTD) for
papers and other related resources to apply DMs for RL.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LoRA重用方法通常依赖显式任务标签或额外训练，这在部署中不实用，并且通常激活固定数量的完整LoRA模块，导致参数冗余或不足而降低性能。

Method: 提出HiLoRA框架，定义秩一组件(ROCs)，将每个秩参数视为独立单元。在序列级别自适应选择LoRA子集并确定ROC分配，在token级别进一步细化路由，仅激活最有信息的ROCs。

Result: 在领域泛化任务中，HiLoRA相比最先进基线实现了高达55%的准确率提升，同时保持相当的推理吞吐量。

Conclusion: HiLoRA提供了一种无需训练的高效LoRA重用方法，通过分层路由机制显著提升了领域泛化性能，并提供了理论保证。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a widely used technique for
adapting large language models (LLMs) to new domains, due to its modular design
and broad availability on platforms such as HuggingFace. This availability has
motivated efforts to reuse existing LoRAs for domain generalization.
  However, existing methods often rely on explicit task labels or additional
training, which are impractical for deployment. Moreover, they typically
activate a fixed number of entire LoRA modules, leading to parameter redundancy
or insufficiency that degrade performance.
  In this paper, we propose \texttt{HiLoRA}, a training-free framework that
performs adaptive hierarchical routing over LoRA pools. Drawing on structural
properties of LoRA, we define rank-one components (ROCs), in which each rank
parameter is regarded as an independent unit. For a given input sequence,
\texttt{HiLoRA} first adaptively selects a subset of LoRAs and determines their
ROC allocation based on Gaussian likelihoods at the sequence level. At the
token level, it further refines routing by activating only the most informative
ROCs.
  We further provide theoretical guarantees that \texttt{HiLoRA} selects the
most relevant LoRAs with high probability.
  Extensive experiments show that \texttt{HiLoRA} achieves substantial
improvements in domain generalization, with accuracy gains of up to {\small
$55\%$} over state-of-the-art baselines, while maintaining comparable inference
throughput.

Abstract: Self-improvement has emerged as a state-of-the-art paradigm in Neural
Combinatorial Optimization (NCO), where models iteratively refine their
policies by generating and imitating high-quality solutions. Despite strong
empirical performance, existing methods face key limitations. Training is
computationally expensive, as policy updates require sampling numerous
candidate solutions per instance to extract a single expert trajectory. More
fundamentally, these approaches fail to exploit the structure of combinatorial
problems involving the coordination of multiple agents, such as vehicles in
min-max routing or machines in scheduling. By supervising on single-action
trajectories, they fail to exploit agent-permutation symmetries, where distinct
sequences of actions yield identical solutions, hindering generalization and
the ability to learn coordinated behavior.
  We address these challenges by extending self-improvement to operate over
joint multi-agent actions. Our model architecture predicts complete agent-task
assignments jointly at each decision step. To explicitly leverage symmetries,
we employ a set-prediction loss, which supervises the policy on multiple expert
assignments for any given state. This approach enhances sample efficiency and
the model's ability to learn coordinated behavior. Furthermore, by generating
multi-agent actions in parallel, it drastically accelerates the solution
generation phase of the self-improvement loop. Empirically, we validate our
method on several combinatorial problems, demonstrating consistent improvements
in the quality of the final solution and a reduced generation latency compared
to standard self-improvement.

Motivation: 传统物理信息极限学习机在处理涉及高频和变频率行为的偏微分方程时面临挑战，需要一种能够有效处理这些问题的改进方法。

Method: 1) 将傅里叶特征映射变体集成到ELM中作为基于傅里叶的激活函数；2) 为隐藏神经元分配频率系数集合；3) 开发创新的超参数初始化方法，通过监控ELM输出权重的分布来确定。

Result: 在五个案例研究中进行了十个数值示例验证，GFF-PIELM显著提高了预测精度，同时不增加训练时间和架构复杂度。能够有效处理高频、变频率、多尺度行为、不规则边界和反问题。

Conclusion: PIELM可以扩展到高精度求解高频和变频率PDEs，所提出的初始化策略可能进一步启发其他物理信息机器学习框架的发展。

Abstract: Conventional physics-informed extreme learning machine (PIELM) often faces
challenges in solving partial differential equations (PDEs) involving
high-frequency and variable-frequency behaviors. To address these challenges,
we propose a general Fourier feature physics-informed extreme learning machine
(GFF-PIELM). We demonstrate that directly concatenating multiple Fourier
feature mappings (FFMs) and an extreme learning machine (ELM) network makes it
difficult to determine frequency-related hyperparameters. Fortunately, we find
an alternative to establish the GFF-PIELM in three main steps. First, we
integrate a variation of FFM into ELM as the Fourier-based activation function,
so there is still one hidden layer in the GFF-PIELM framework. Second, we
assign a set of frequency coefficients to the hidden neurons, which enables ELM
network to capture diverse frequency components of target solutions. Finally,
we develop an innovative, straightforward initialization method for these
hyperparameters by monitoring the distribution of ELM output weights. GFF-PIELM
not only retains the high accuracy, efficiency, and simplicity of the PIELM
framework but also inherits the ability of FFMs to effectively handle
high-frequency problems. We carry out five case studies with a total of ten
numerical examples to highlight the feasibility and validity of the proposed
GFF-PIELM, involving high frequency, variable frequency, multi-scale behaviour,
irregular boundary and inverse problems. Compared to conventional PIELM, the
GFF-PIELM approach significantly improves predictive accuracy without
additional cost in training time and architecture complexity. Our results
confirm that that PIELM can be extended to solve high-frequency and
variable-frequency PDEs with high accuracy, and our initialization strategy may
further inspire advances in other physics-informed machine learning (PIML)
frameworks.

Abstract: Safe policy improvement (SPI) offers theoretical control over policy updates,
yet existing guarantees largely concern offline, tabular reinforcement learning
(RL). We study SPI in general online settings, when combined with world model
and representation learning. We develop a theoretical framework showing that
restricting policy updates to a well-defined neighborhood of the current policy
ensures monotonic improvement and convergence. This analysis links transition
and reward prediction losses to representation quality, yielding online, "deep"
analogues of classical SPI theorems from the offline RL literature. Building on
these results, we introduce DeepSPI, a principled on-policy algorithm that
couples local transition and reward losses with regularised policy updates. On
the ALE-57 benchmark, DeepSPI matches or exceeds strong baselines, including
PPO and DeepMDPs, while retaining theoretical guarantees.

Abstract: Accurate rainfall forecasting, particularly for extreme events, remains a
significant challenge in climatology and the Earth system. This paper presents
novel physics-informed Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) combined with extreme-value
analysis techniques to improve gauge-station rainfall predictions across
Thailand. The model leverages a graph-structured representation of gauge
stations to capture complex spatiotemporal patterns, and it offers
explainability through teleconnections. We preprocess relevant climate indices
that potentially influence regional rainfall. The proposed Graph Attention
Network with Long Short-Term Memory (Attention-LSTM) applies the attention
mechanism using initial edge features derived from simple
orographic-precipitation physics formulation. The embeddings are subsequently
processed by LSTM layers. To address extremes, we perform Peak-Over-Threshold
(POT) mapping using the novel Spatial Season-aware Generalized Pareto
Distribution (GPD) method, which overcomes limitations of traditional
machine-learning models. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms
well-established baselines across most regions, including areas prone to
extremes, and remains strongly competitive with the state of the art. Compared
with the operational forecasting system SEAS5, our real-world application
improves extreme-event prediction and offers a practical enhancement to produce
fine-resolution maps that support decision-making in long-term water
management.

*Rui Hu,Yu Chen,Longbo Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文首次对马尔可夫采样下具有演化奖励函数的单时间尺度actor-critic算法进行了有限时间收敛性分析，证明了在奖励参数缓慢变化时仍能达到O(1/√T)的收敛速率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多实用的强化学习算法使用演化奖励函数（如奖励塑形、熵正则化、课程学习），但缺乏理论分析基础。本文旨在为这些技术提供理论支撑。

Method: 采用单时间尺度actor-critic算法，考虑奖励参数随时间步变化影响策略优化和值估计的情况，在马尔可夫采样下进行收敛性分析。

Result: 在标准假设下，推导了actor和critic误差的非渐近界，证明当奖励参数演化足够慢时，可以达到O(1/√T)的收敛速率，与静态奖励的最佳已知速率匹配。

Conclusion: 该分析为许多流行的RL技术提供了理论基础，证明在奖励函数演化的情况下仍能保持良好收敛性能，同时改进了静态奖励情况下分布不匹配分析的最佳已知速率。

Abstract: Many popular practical reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms employ evolving
reward functions-through techniques such as reward shaping, entropy
regularization, or curriculum learning-yet their theoretical foundations remain
underdeveloped. This paper provides the first finite-time convergence analysis
of a single-timescale actor-critic algorithm in the presence of an evolving
reward function under Markovian sampling. We consider a setting where the
reward parameters may change at each time step, affecting both policy
optimization and value estimation. Under standard assumptions, we derive
non-asymptotic bounds for both actor and critic errors. Our result shows that
an $O(1/\sqrt{T})$ convergence rate is achievable, matching the best-known rate
for static rewards, provided the reward parameters evolve slowly enough. This
rate is preserved when the reward is updated via a gradient-based rule with
bounded gradient and on the same timescale as the actor and critic, offering a
theoretical foundation for many popular RL techniques. As a secondary
contribution, we introduce a novel analysis of distribution mismatch under
Markovian sampling, improving the best-known rate by a factor of $\log^2T$ in
the static-reward case.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出基于TSP的token重排序策略和误差后处理，解决同态加密下LLM文本生成的挑战，提升生成文本的连贯性并保护数据隐私。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着用户越来越多地使用私有信息与LLM交互，安全加密通信变得至关重要。同态加密虽然支持加密数据计算，但文本生成特别是下一个token预测仍是实际加密交互的主要障碍。

Method: 采用基于旅行商问题(TSP)的token重排序策略，结合后处理步骤进一步减少近似误差，解决加密文本生成中的困难。

Result: 理论分析和实验结果表明，该方法能防止崩溃、提高生成文本的连贯性，并在整个过程中保持数据隐私。

Conclusion: 这项工作推进了实用且保护隐私的LLM推理的可行性，为加密交互提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: As users increasingly interact with large language models (LLMs) using
private information, secure and encrypted communication becomes essential.
Homomorphic encryption (HE) provides a principled solution by enabling
computation directly on encrypted data. Although prior work has explored
aspects of running LLMs under HE, the challenge of text generation,
particularly next-token prediction, has received limited attention and remains
a key obstacle to practical encrypted interaction. In this work, we propose a
TSP-based token reordering strategy to address the difficulties of encrypted
text generation, together with a post-processing step that further reduces
approximation error. Theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrate
that our method prevents collapse, improves coherence in generated text, and
preserves data privacy throughout. Overall, our contributions advance the
feasibility of practical and privacy-preserving LLM inference.

TL;DR: 该论文针对多模态数据中的跨模态错误检测问题，在表格数据上对多种方法进行了基准测试，发现Cleanlab和DataScope结合AutoML框架表现最佳，但现有方法在处理真实世界重尾数据时仍有局限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型组织中确保数据质量面临挑战，传统错误检测方法主要关注单一模态（如表格），容易忽略跨模态错误，特别是在电子商务和医疗等图像、表格和文本数据共存的领域。

Method: 在四个数据集上对五种基线方法进行基准测试，评估跨模态错误检测在表格数据中的表现。

Result: Cleanlab（标签错误检测框架）和DataScope（数据估值方法）在结合强大的AutoML框架时表现最佳，获得了最高的F1分数。

Conclusion: 当前方法在处理真实世界重尾数据时仍然有限，需要在这一领域进行进一步研究。

Abstract: Ensuring data quality at scale remains a persistent challenge for large
organizations. Despite recent advances, maintaining accurate and consistent
data is still complex, especially when dealing with multiple data modalities.
Traditional error detection and correction methods tend to focus on a single
modality, typically a table, and often miss cross-modal errors that are common
in domains like e-Commerce and healthcare, where image, tabular, and text data
co-exist. To address this gap, we take an initial step towards cross-modal
error detection in tabular data, by benchmarking several methods. Our
evaluation spans four datasets and five baseline approaches. Among them,
Cleanlab, a label error detection framework, and DataScope, a data valuation
method, perform the best when paired with a strong AutoML framework, achieving
the highest F1 scores. Our findings indicate that current methods remain
limited, particularly when applied to heavy-tailed real-world data, motivating
further research in this area.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GNN预训练方法主要针对同质图设计，而现实图多为异构图，且存在语义不匹配问题（原始数据与理想可转移语义信息数据之间的差异）。

Method: 设计结构感知预训练任务捕获异构图结构特性，构建语义邻居组成的扰动子空间来处理语义不匹配，使模型关注语义空间中的通用知识。

Conclusion: 提出的框架能有效预训练异构图神经网络，通过结构感知和语义感知任务解决语义不匹配问题，提升模型的可转移性。

Abstract: In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have facilitated the
development of graph data mining. However, training GNNs requires sufficient
labeled task-specific data, which is expensive and sometimes unavailable. To be
less dependent on labeled data, recent studies propose to pre-train GNNs in a
self-supervised manner and then apply the pre-trained GNNs to downstream tasks
with limited labeled data. However, most existing methods are designed solely
for homogeneous graphs (real-world graphs are mostly heterogeneous) and do not
consider semantic mismatch (the semantic difference between the original data
and the ideal data containing more transferable semantic information). In this
paper, we propose an effective framework to pre-train GNNs on the large-scale
heterogeneous graph. We first design a structure-aware pre-training task, which
aims to capture structural properties in heterogeneous graphs. Then, we design
a semantic-aware pre-training task to tackle the mismatch. Specifically, we
construct a perturbation subspace composed of semantic neighbors to help deal
with the semantic mismatch. Semantic neighbors make the model focus more on the
general knowledge in the semantic space, which in turn assists the model in
learning knowledge with better transferability. Finally, extensive experiments
are conducted on real-world large-scale heterogeneous graphs to demonstrate the
superiority of the proposed method over state-of-the-art baselines. Code

### [170] [Cautious Weight Decay](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12402)
*Lizhang Chen,Jonathan Li,Kaizhao Liang,Baiyu Su,Cong Xie,Nuo Wang Pierse,Chen Liang,Ni Lao,Qiang Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Cautious Weight Decay (CWD) 是一种优化器无关的改进方法，仅在参数坐标符号与优化器更新方向一致时应用权重衰减，无需额外超参数调优即可提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准解耦权重衰减会隐式优化正则化或约束目标，而CWD旨在保留原始损失函数，寻找未修改目标的局部帕累托最优平稳点。

Method: CWD是一种单行修改，仅对符号与优化器更新方向一致的参数坐标应用权重衰减，可解释为双层优化问题，在到达平稳流形时诱导滑动模态行为。

Result: 在语言模型预训练和ImageNet分类任务中，CWD在百万到十亿参数规模上持续改善最终损失和准确率。

Conclusion: CWD是AdamW、Lion和Muon等优化器的即插即用改进，无需新超参数或额外调优，能有效提升模型性能。

Abstract: We introduce Cautious Weight Decay (CWD), a one-line, optimizer-agnostic
modification that applies weight decay only to parameter coordinates whose
signs align with the optimizer update. Unlike standard decoupled decay, which
implicitly optimizes a regularized or constrained objective, CWD preserves the
original loss and admits a bilevel interpretation: it induces sliding-mode
behavior upon reaching the stationary manifold, allowing it to search for
locally Pareto-optimal stationary points of the unmodified objective. In
practice, CWD is a drop-in change for optimizers such as AdamW, Lion, and Muon,
requiring no new hyperparameters or additional tuning. For language model
pre-training and ImageNet classification, CWD consistently improves final loss
and accuracy at million- to billion-parameter scales.

TL;DR: 本文提出使用两种连续距离函数来评估生成式AI模型在无机晶体材料生成中的独特性和新颖性，克服了传统距离函数的四个主要局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前用于评估晶体材料生成模型的距离函数存在四个关键问题：无法量化化合物间相似程度、不能区分组成和结构差异、缺乏对原子坐标变化的Lipschitz连续性、以及独特性度量对生成样本排列不具不变性。

Method: 提出两种连续距离函数来评估生成模型的独特性和新颖性，这些函数在理论上能够克服传统距离函数的局限性。

Result: 实验表明，新提出的距离函数能够揭示传统距离函数所忽略的洞察，为评估和比较无机晶体生成模型提供了更可靠的基础。

Conclusion: 连续距离函数为生成式AI模型在功能材料发现领域的评估提供了更准确和可靠的度量标准，有助于更好地解决气候变化等科学挑战。

Abstract: To address pressing scientific challenges such as climate change,
increasingly sophisticated generative artificial intelligence models are being
developed that can efficiently sample the large chemical space of possible
functional materials. These models can quickly sample new chemical compositions
paired with crystal structures. They are typically evaluated using uniqueness
and novelty metrics, which depend on a chosen crystal distance function.
However, the most prevalent distance function has four limitations: it fails to
quantify the degree of similarity between compounds, cannot distinguish
compositional difference and structural difference, lacks Lipschitz continuity
against shifts in atomic coordinates, and results in a uniqueness metric that
is not invariant against the permutation of generated samples. In this work, we
propose using two continuous distance functions to evaluate uniqueness and
novelty, which theoretically overcome these limitations. Our experiments show
that these distances reveal insights missed by traditional distance functions,
providing a more reliable basis for evaluating and comparing generative models
for inorganic crystals.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于高斯过程的非参数动态定价方法，使用贝叶斯优化来处理未知需求函数，在无限和有限库存两种设置下都优于传统强化学习方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统动态定价方法通常假设需求函数具有特定参数形式，这在现实场景中可能不成立，限制了方法的适用性。需要一种避免限制性建模假设的方法。

Method: 使用高斯过程对需求函数进行非参数建模，将其视为价格的未知黑盒函数，基于贝叶斯优化开发定价算法，适用于无限和有限库存两种设置。

Result: 通过大量实验证明，基于贝叶斯优化的方法在收入方面优于多种最先进的强化学习算法，需要更少的假设并提供更强的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 贝叶斯优化是在复杂不确定环境中进行动态定价的强大实用工具，能够提供后悔保证并量化学习效率。

Abstract: Dynamic pricing is the practice of adjusting the selling price of a product
to maximize a firm's revenue by responding to market demand. The literature
typically distinguishes between two settings: infinite inventory, where the
firm has unlimited stock and time to sell, and finite inventory, where both
inventory and selling horizon are limited. In both cases, the central challenge
lies in the fact that the demand function -- how sales respond to price -- is
unknown and must be learned from data. Traditional approaches often assume a
specific parametric form for the demand function, enabling the use of
reinforcement learning (RL) to identify near-optimal pricing strategies.
However, such assumptions may not hold in real-world scenarios, limiting the
applicability of these methods. In this work, we propose a Gaussian Process
(GP) based nonparametric approach to dynamic pricing that avoids restrictive
modeling assumptions. We treat the demand function as a black-box function of
the price and develop pricing algorithms based on Bayesian Optimization (BO) --
a sample-efficient method for optimizing unknown functions. We present BO-based
algorithms tailored for both infinite and finite inventory settings and provide
regret guarantees for both regimes, thereby quantifying the learning efficiency
of our methods. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our BO-based
methods outperform several state-of-the-art RL algorithms in terms of revenue,
while requiring fewer assumptions and offering greater robustness. This
highlights Bayesian Optimization as a powerful and practical tool for dynamic
pricing in complex, uncertain environments.

*Israel Mason-Williams,Gabryel Mason-Williams,Helen Yannakoudakis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文重新审视了深度学习中的平坦最小值与泛化能力的关系，提出尖锐性应被视为函数依赖属性而非泛化差的可靠指标，发现正则化方法会产生更尖锐但泛化更好的最小值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统观点认为平坦最小值与更好的泛化能力相关，但近期研究显示这种关系更为复杂，存在理论反例和实证例外。本文旨在重新评估尖锐性在模型性能中的作用。

Method: 进行了广泛的实证研究，从单目标优化到现代图像分类任务，比较了不同正则化方法（如SAM、权重衰减、数据增强）对损失景观几何的影响。

Result: 发现正则化模型往往收敛到更尖锐的最小值，但这些尖锐最小值反而表现出更好的泛化、校准、鲁棒性和功能一致性。无正则化的基线模型虽然收敛到更平坦的最小值，但在所有安全指标上表现更差。

Conclusion: 函数复杂性而非平坦度本身决定了解的几何形状，尖锐最小值可以反映更合适的归纳偏置（特别是在正则化下），需要对损失景观几何进行以函数为中心的重新评估。

Abstract: Flat minima are widely believed to correlate with improved generalisation in
deep neural networks. However, this connection has proven more nuanced in
recent studies, with both theoretical counterexamples and empirical exceptions
emerging in the literature. In this paper, we revisit the role of sharpness in
model performance, proposing that sharpness is better understood as a
function-dependent property rather than a reliable indicator of poor
generalisation. We conduct extensive empirical studies, from single-objective
optimisation to modern image classification tasks, showing that sharper minima
often emerge when models are regularised (e.g., via SAM, weight decay, or data
augmentation), and that these sharp minima can coincide with better
generalisation, calibration, robustness, and functional consistency. Across a
range of models and datasets, we find that baselines without regularisation
tend to converge to flatter minima yet often perform worse across all safety
metrics. Our findings demonstrate that function complexity, rather than
flatness alone, governs the geometry of solutions, and that sharper minima can
reflect more appropriate inductive biases (especially under regularisation),
calling for a function-centric reappraisal of loss landscape geometry.

TL;DR: 提出了TCVBM框架，将桥匹配扩展到时间相关视频序列，通过显式建模序列间依赖关系来保持时间一致性，在视频插帧、图像到视频生成和视频超分辨率任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型擅长从噪声到数据的生成，但在复杂分布间的转换任务中表现不佳。桥匹配模型虽然能解决这个问题，但尚未应用于时间相关数据序列，而视频任务特别需要保持时间一致性。

Method: TCVBM框架扩展桥匹配到时间相关视频序列，在扩散桥中显式建模序列间依赖关系，将时间相关性直接纳入采样过程。

Result: 在视频插帧、图像到视频生成和视频超分辨率三个任务中，TCVBM在多个定量指标上均优于基于桥匹配和扩散模型的传统方法，展现出更好的生成质量和重建保真度。

Conclusion: TCVBM成功将桥匹配扩展到时间相关视频序列，通过显式建模时间相关性，在视频任务中实现了更好的性能，证明了该方法在保持时间一致性方面的有效性。

Abstract: Diffusion models excel in noise-to-data generation tasks, providing a mapping
from a Gaussian distribution to a more complex data distribution. However they
struggle to model translations between complex distributions, limiting their
effectiveness in data-to-data tasks. While Bridge Matching (BM) models address
this by finding the translation between data distributions, their application
to time-correlated data sequences remains unexplored. This is a critical
limitation for video generation and manipulation tasks, where maintaining
temporal coherence is particularly important. To address this gap, we propose
Time-Correlated Video Bridge Matching (TCVBM), a framework that extends BM to
time-correlated data sequences in the video domain. TCVBM explicitly models
inter-sequence dependencies within the diffusion bridge, directly incorporating
temporal correlations into the sampling process. We compare our approach to
classical methods based on bridge matching and diffusion models for three
video-related tasks: frame interpolation, image-to-video generation, and video
super-resolution. TCVBM achieves superior performance across multiple
quantitative metrics, demonstrating enhanced generation quality and
reconstruction fidelity.

TL;DR: 提出CrossAD框架，通过跨尺度关联和跨窗口建模进行时间序列异常检测，解决了现有方法忽视跨尺度动态关联和固定窗口限制的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时间序列异常检测方法在多尺度建模时往往独立处理各尺度信息或使用简单特征融合，忽略了异常发生时跨尺度关联的动态变化，且固定滑动窗口限制了上下文信息的捕获。

Method: 提出跨尺度重构方法，从粗粒度序列重构细粒度序列以显式捕捉跨尺度关联；设计查询库并整合全局多尺度上下文，克服固定窗口大小的限制。

Result: 在多个真实世界数据集上使用九种评估指标进行广泛实验，验证了CrossAD的有效性，展示了在异常检测方面的最先进性能。

Conclusion: CrossAD通过考虑跨尺度关联和跨窗口建模，显著提升了时间序列异常检测的性能，为多尺度时间序列分析提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection plays a crucial role in a wide range of
real-world applications. Given that time series data can exhibit different
patterns at different sampling granularities, multi-scale modeling has proven
beneficial for uncovering latent anomaly patterns that may not be apparent at a
single scale. However, existing methods often model multi-scale information
independently or rely on simple feature fusion strategies, neglecting the
dynamic changes in cross-scale associations that occur during anomalies.
Moreover, most approaches perform multi-scale modeling based on fixed sliding
windows, which limits their ability to capture comprehensive contextual
information. In this work, we propose CrossAD, a novel framework for time
series Anomaly Detection that takes Cross-scale associations and Cross-window
modeling into account. We propose a cross-scale reconstruction that
reconstructs fine-grained series from coarser series, explicitly capturing
cross-scale associations. Furthermore, we design a query library and
incorporate global multi-scale context to overcome the limitations imposed by
fixed window sizes. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple real-world
datasets using nine evaluation metrics validate the effectiveness of CrossAD,
demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in anomaly detection.

TL;DR: 提出PubSub-VFL，一种基于发布/订阅架构的垂直联邦学习新范式，通过分层异步机制解决传统VFL训练效率低、资源利用率差的问题，在保持精度的同时实现2-7倍加速和高达91.07%的资源利用率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着数字经济发展，组织间数据协作需求增长，但隐私问题使直接数据共享不可行。垂直联邦学习(VFL)虽能解决隐私问题，但其同步依赖设计导致训练延迟高，参与者资源和数据异构性进一步降低计算效率。

Method: 利用发布/订阅架构的解耦能力和参数服务器架构的数据并行性，设计分层异步机制；基于参与者系统配置文件形式化优化问题，选择最优超参数同时保护隐私；理论分析证明稳定收敛性和与差分隐私等安全协议的兼容性。

Result: 在五个基准数据集上的广泛案例研究表明，与最先进基线相比，PubSub-VFL在不损失精度的情况下将训练速度提升2-7倍，计算资源利用率高达91.07%。

Conclusion: PubSub-VFL通过创新的发布/订阅架构有效解决了VFL中的效率和资源利用问题，为安全高效的跨组织数据协作提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of the digital economy, data collaboration between
organizations has become a well-established business model, driving the growth
of various industries. However, privacy concerns make direct data sharing
impractical. To address this, Two-Party Split Learning (a.k.a. Vertical
Federated Learning (VFL)) has emerged as a promising solution for secure
collaborative learning. Despite its advantages, this architecture still suffers
from low computational resource utilization and training efficiency.
Specifically, its synchronous dependency design increases training latency,
while resource and data heterogeneity among participants further hinder
efficient computation. To overcome these challenges, we propose PubSub-VFL, a
novel VFL paradigm with a Publisher/Subscriber architecture optimized for
two-party collaborative learning with high computational efficiency. PubSub-VFL
leverages the decoupling capabilities of the Pub/Sub architecture and the data
parallelism of the parameter server architecture to design a hierarchical
asynchronous mechanism, reducing training latency and improving system
efficiency. Additionally, to mitigate the training imbalance caused by resource
and data heterogeneity, we formalize an optimization problem based on
participants' system profiles, enabling the selection of optimal
hyperparameters while preserving privacy. We conduct a theoretical analysis to
demonstrate that PubSub-VFL achieves stable convergence and is compatible with
security protocols such as differential privacy. Extensive case studies on five
benchmark datasets further validate its effectiveness, showing that, compared
to state-of-the-art baselines, PubSub-VFL not only accelerates training by $2
\sim 7\times$ without compromising accuracy, but also achieves a computational
resource utilization rate of up to 91.07%.

Motivation: 现有去噪生成模型在求解离散化反向时间SDE或ODE时，存在预定义噪声水平与采样中间状态实际噪声水平不匹配的问题，这种噪声偏移导致次优生成质量。

Method: 提出噪声感知引导(NAG)方法，明确引导采样轨迹与预定义噪声调度保持一致，并引入无分类器变体，通过噪声条件丢弃联合训练噪声条件和非条件模型。

Result: 在ImageNet生成和各种监督微调任务上的广泛实验表明，NAG能持续缓解噪声偏移，显著提升主流扩散模型的生成质量。

Conclusion: 噪声偏移是扩散模型中普遍存在的问题，NAG提供了一种简单有效的校正方法，能显著改善生成性能。

Abstract: Existing denoising generative models rely on solving discretized reverse-time
SDEs or ODEs. In this paper, we identify a long-overlooked yet pervasive issue
in this family of models: a misalignment between the pre-defined noise level
and the actual noise level encoded in intermediate states during sampling. We
refer to this misalignment as noise shift. Through empirical analysis, we
demonstrate that noise shift is widespread in modern diffusion models and
exhibits a systematic bias, leading to sub-optimal generation due to both
out-of-distribution generalization and inaccurate denoising updates. To address
this problem, we propose Noise Awareness Guidance (NAG), a simple yet effective
correction method that explicitly steers sampling trajectories to remain
consistent with the pre-defined noise schedule. We further introduce a
classifier-free variant of NAG, which jointly trains a noise-conditional and a
noise-unconditional model via noise-condition dropout, thereby eliminating the
need for external classifiers. Extensive experiments, including ImageNet
generation and various supervised fine-tuning tasks, show that NAG consistently
mitigates noise shift and substantially improves the generation quality of
mainstream diffusion models.

Abstract: Causal discovery aims to learn causal relationships between variables from
targeted data, making it a fundamental task in machine learning. However,
causal discovery algorithms often rely on unverifiable causal assumptions,
which are usually difficult to satisfy in real-world data, thereby limiting the
broad application of causal discovery in practical scenarios. Inspired by these
considerations, this work extensively benchmarks the empirical performance of
various mainstream causal discovery algorithms, which assume i.i.d. data, under
eight model assumption violations. Our experimental results show that
differentiable causal discovery methods exhibit robustness under the metrics of
Structural Hamming Distance and Structural Intervention Distance of the
inferred graphs in commonly used challenging scenarios, except for scale
variation. We also provide the theoretical explanations for the performance of
differentiable causal discovery methods. Finally, our work aims to
comprehensively benchmark the performance of recent differentiable causal
discovery methods under model assumption violations, and provide the standard
for reasonable evaluation of causal discovery, as well as to further promote
its application in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: We examine a multi-armed bandit problem with contextual information, where
the objective is to ensure that each arm receives a minimum aggregated reward
across contexts while simultaneously maximizing the total cumulative reward.
This framework captures a broad class of real-world applications where fair
revenue allocation is critical and contextual variation is inherent. The
cross-context aggregation of minimum reward constraints, while enabling better
performance and easier feasibility, introduces significant technical challenges
-- particularly the absence of closed-form optimal allocations typically
available in standard MAB settings. We design and analyze algorithms that
either optimistically prioritize performance or pessimistically enforce
constraint satisfaction. For each algorithm, we derive problem-dependent upper
bounds on both regret and constraint violations. Furthermore, we establish a
lower bound demonstrating that the dependence on the time horizon in our
results is optimal in general and revealing fundamental limitations of the free
exploration principle leveraged in prior work.

Abstract: The increasing popularity of portable ECG systems and the growing demand for
privacy-compliant, energy-efficient real-time analysis require new approaches
to signal processing at the point of data acquisition. In this context, the
edge domain is acquiring increasing importance, as it not only reduces latency
times, but also enables an increased level of data security. The FACE project
aims to develop an innovative machine learning solution for analysing long-term
electrocardiograms that synergistically combines the strengths of edge and
cloud computing. In this thesis, various pre-processing steps of ECG signals
are analysed with regard to their applicability in the project. The selection
of suitable methods in the edge area is based in particular on criteria such as
energy efficiency, processing capability and real-time capability.

Motivation: 尽管GDPR和HIPAA等数据保护法规推动了对跨组织联邦学习的兴趣，但其实际采用仍然有限，需要了解实践中的挑战

Method: 进行访谈研究，涵盖用户组织、软件提供商和学术研究人员等多样化利益相关者

Result: 发现跨组织联邦学习面临一系列尚未被现有研究充分捕捉的挑战，这些问题与跨设备联邦学习等其他形式截然不同

Conclusion: 提出了未来研究方向以帮助克服这些挑战

Abstract: Cross-silo federated learning (FL) is a promising approach to enable
cross-organization collaboration in machine learning model development without
directly sharing private data. Despite growing organizational interest driven
by data protection regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA, the adoption of
cross-silo FL remains limited in practice. In this paper, we conduct an
interview study to understand the practical challenges associated with
cross-silo FL adoption. With interviews spanning a diverse set of stakeholders
such as user organizations, software providers, and academic researchers, we
uncover various barriers, from concerns about model performance to questions of
incentives and trust between participating organizations. Our study shows that
cross-silo FL faces a set of challenges that have yet to be well-captured by
existing research in the area and are quite distinct from other forms of
federated learning such as cross-device FL. We end with a discussion on future
research directions that can help overcome these challenges.

Motivation: 理解知识蒸馏的功能影响，量化其压缩能力和知识转移机制，区分压缩与架构缩减的影响。

Method: 使用假设检验、对照实验和随机控制蒸馏，分析不同数据模态下的知识转移机制，探索多种蒸馏变体和模型规模的蒸馏缩放规律。

Result: 在某些模态和架构中存在统计显著的知识转移，但程度低于预期；显著转移情况下存在严重的负知识不对称传递；知识蒸馏主要作为数据依赖的正则化器而非压缩机制。

Conclusion: 知识蒸馏的功能更多是数据依赖的正则化，存在负知识不对称传递的安全隐患，压缩能力有限。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation is often considered a compression mechanism when
judged on the resulting student's accuracy and loss, yet its functional impact
is poorly understood. In this work, we quantify the compression capacity of
knowledge distillation and the resulting knowledge transfer from a functional
perspective, decoupling compression from architectural reduction, which
provides an improved understanding of knowledge distillation. We employ
hypothesis testing, controls, and random control distillation to understand
knowledge transfer mechanisms across data modalities. To rigorously test the
breadth and limits of our analyses, we explore multiple distillation variants
and analyse distillation scaling laws across model sizes. Our findings
demonstrate that, while there is statistically significant knowledge transfer
in some modalities and architectures, the extent of this transfer is less
pronounced than anticipated, even under conditions designed to maximise
knowledge sharing. Notably, in cases of significant knowledge transfer, we
identify a consistent and severe asymmetric transfer of negative knowledge to
the student, raising safety concerns in knowledge distillation applications.
Across 12 experimental setups, 9 architectures, and 7 datasets, our findings
show that knowledge distillation functions less as a compression mechanism and
more as a data-dependent regulariser with a negative asymmetric payoff.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高维动力系统通常具有低维流形结构，传统方法需要同时学习粗粒化变量和动力学方程，这导致训练复杂且不稳定。

Method: 利用预训练的FIMs估计动力系统的无穷小生成元，冻结FIM权重，仅训练编码器-解码器映射，定义简单的模拟一致性损失函数。

Result: 在随机双井系统与半圆扩散的合成视频数据上验证了该方法在快速粗粒化流程中的潜力。

Conclusion: 该方法通过解耦表示学习和动力学建模，稳定了表示学习过程，为快速可重用的粗粒化流程提供了新思路。

Abstract: High-dimensional recordings of dynamical processes are often characterized by
a much smaller set of effective variables, evolving on low-dimensional
manifolds. Identifying these latent dynamics requires solving two intertwined
problems: discovering appropriate coarse-grained variables and simultaneously
fitting the governing equations. Most machine learning approaches tackle these
tasks jointly by training autoencoders together with models that enforce
dynamical consistency. We propose to decouple the two problems by leveraging
the recently introduced Foundation Inference Models (FIMs). FIMs are pretrained
models that estimate the infinitesimal generators of dynamical systems (e.g.,
the drift and diffusion of a stochastic differential equation) in zero-shot
mode. By amortizing the inference of the dynamics through a FIM with frozen
weights, and training only the encoder-decoder map, we define a simple,
simulation-consistent loss that stabilizes representation learning. A proof of
concept on a stochastic double-well system with semicircle diffusion, embedded
into synthetic video data, illustrates the potential of this approach for fast
and reusable coarse-graining pipelines.

TL;DR: 提出了元主动特征获取（meta-AFA）问题，并介绍了Learning-to-Measure（L2M）方法，该方法通过可靠的未见任务不确定性量化和基于不确定性的贪婪特征获取策略，在多种任务上学习特征获取策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的主动特征获取方法主要针对单一预定任务，限制了可扩展性。实际应用中，AFA方法通常需要从具有系统性特征缺失和有限任务特定标签的回顾性数据中学习。

Method: L2M包含两个核心组件：i) 对未见任务进行可靠的不确定性量化，ii) 基于不确定性的贪婪特征获取代理，最大化条件互信息。采用序列建模或自回归预训练方法来支持具有任意缺失的任务的可靠不确定性量化。

Result: 在合成和真实世界的表格基准测试中，L2M匹配或超越了任务特定的基线方法，特别是在标签稀缺和高度缺失的情况下表现优异。

Conclusion: L2M能够直接在具有回顾性缺失的数据集上运行，并在上下文中执行元AFA任务，无需针对每个任务重新训练，展示了在多种任务上学习特征获取策略的有效性。

Abstract: Active feature acquisition (AFA) is a sequential decision-making problem
where the goal is to improve model performance for test instances by adaptively
selecting which features to acquire. In practice, AFA methods often learn from
retrospective data with systematic missingness in the features and limited
task-specific labels. Most prior work addresses acquisition for a single
predetermined task, limiting scalability. To address this limitation, we
formalize the meta-AFA problem, where the goal is to learn acquisition policies
across various tasks. We introduce Learning-to-Measure (L2M), which consists of
i) reliable uncertainty quantification over unseen tasks, and ii) an
uncertainty-guided greedy feature acquisition agent that maximizes conditional
mutual information. We demonstrate a sequence-modeling or autoregressive
pre-training approach that underpins reliable uncertainty quantification for
tasks with arbitrary missingness. L2M operates directly on datasets with
retrospective missingness and performs the meta-AFA task in-context,
eliminating per-task retraining. Across synthetic and real-world tabular
benchmarks, L2M matches or surpasses task-specific baselines, particularly
under scarce labels and high missingness.

TL;DR: Laminar是一个用于大语言模型强化学习后训练的可扩展系统，通过轨迹级异步和完全解耦架构解决现有RL框架因轨迹生成延迟高度偏斜导致的GPU利用率低下问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习后训练框架在扩展到大规模集群时，由于RL轨迹生成的极端长尾偏斜性导致严重的GPU利用率低下，而当前的异步RL系统依赖全局权重同步，无法适应RL训练中轨迹生成延迟的高度偏斜和动态变化分布。

Method: 提出Laminar系统：1）用中继工作者层级替代全局更新，实现分布式参数服务，支持异步细粒度权重同步；2）动态重打包机制将长尾轨迹整合到专用rollout上，最大化生成吞吐量；3）完全解耦设计隔离故障，确保长时间作业的鲁棒性。

Result: 在1024-GPU集群上的评估显示，Laminar相比最先进系统实现了高达5.48倍的训练吞吐量加速，同时减少了模型收敛时间。

Conclusion: Laminar通过轨迹级异步和完全解耦架构，有效解决了大规模RL后训练中的可扩展性问题，显著提升了训练效率和系统鲁棒性。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) post-training for Large Language Models (LLMs) is
now scaling to large clusters and running for extended durations to enhance
model reasoning performance. However, the scalability of existing RL frameworks
is limited, as extreme long-tail skewness in RL trajectory generation causes
severe GPU underutilization. Current asynchronous RL systems attempt to
mitigate this, but they rely on global weight synchronization between the actor
and all rollouts, which creates a rigid model update schedule. This global
synchronization is ill-suited for the highly skewed and evolving distribution
of trajectory generation latency in RL training, crippling training efficiency.
Our key insight is that efficient scaling requires breaking this lockstep
through trajectory-level asynchrony, which generates and consumes each
trajectory independently. We propose Laminar, a scalable and robust RL
post-training system built on a fully decoupled architecture. First, we replace
global updates with a tier of relay workers acting as a distributed parameter
service. This enables asynchronous and fine-grained weight synchronization,
allowing rollouts to pull the latest weight anytime without stalling the
actor's training loop. Second, a dynamic repack mechanism consolidates
long-tail trajectories onto a few dedicated rollouts, maximizing generation
throughput. The fully decoupled design also isolates failures, ensuring
robustness for long-running jobs. Our evaluation on a 1024-GPU cluster shows
that Laminar achieves up to 5.48$\times$ training throughput speedup over
state-of-the-art systems, while reducing model convergence time.

TL;DR: 本文提出了Bellman Wasserstein距离(BWD)，一种无需训练智能体即可评估离线数据集质量的方法，并在D4RL MuJoCo任务中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离线强化学习依赖于静态数据集，但数据集质量差异很大且难以预先评估。需要一种无需环境交互或完整策略优化的方法来估计数据集质量。

Method: 引入Bellman Wasserstein距离(BWD)，这是一种基于价值感知的最优传输评分，通过行为评论家和状态条件最优传输公式计算，衡量数据集行为策略与随机参考策略的差异。

Result: 在D4RL MuJoCo任务中，BWD与多个离线RL算法的性能得分强相关，能有效预测标准智能体在给定数据集上的表现。作为正则化器使用时还能提升回报。

Conclusion: 价值感知的分布信号如BWD是实用的工具，可用于离线RL数据集筛选和策略优化。

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) learns exclusively from static datasets,
without further interaction with the environment. In practice, such datasets
vary widely in quality, often mixing expert, suboptimal, and even random
trajectories. The choice of algorithm therefore depends on dataset fidelity.
Behavior cloning can suffice on high-quality data, whereas mixed- or
low-quality data typically benefits from offline RL methods that stitch useful
behavior across trajectories. Yet in the wild it is difficult to assess dataset
quality a priori because the data's provenance and skill composition are
unknown. We address the problem of estimating offline dataset quality without
training an agent. We study a spectrum of proxies from simple cumulative
rewards to learned value based estimators, and introduce the Bellman
Wasserstein distance (BWD), a value aware optimal transport score that measures
how dissimilar a dataset's behavioral policy is from a random reference policy.
BWD is computed from a behavioral critic and a state conditional OT
formulation, requiring no environment interaction or full policy optimization.
Across D4RL MuJoCo tasks, BWD strongly correlates with an oracle performance
score that aggregates multiple offline RL algorithms, enabling efficient
prediction of how well standard agents will perform on a given dataset. Beyond
prediction, integrating BWD as a regularizer during policy optimization
explicitly pushes the learned policy away from random behavior and improves
returns. These results indicate that value aware, distributional signals such
as BWD are practical tools for triaging offline RL datasets and policy
optimization.

Conclusion: 这种方法使复杂的事件分析更加易于获取，并加速了科学发现的步伐，为从医学到地震学等多个科学领域提供了更高效的分析工具。

Abstract: Many scientific fields, from medicine to seismology, rely on analyzing
sequences of events over time to understand complex systems. Traditionally,
machine learning models must be built and trained from scratch for each new
dataset, which is a slow and costly process. We introduce a new approach: a
single, powerful model that learns the underlying patterns of event data in
context. We trained this "foundation model" on millions of simulated event
sequences, teaching it a general-purpose understanding of how events can
unfold. As a result, our model can analyze new scientific data instantly,
without retraining, simply by looking at a few examples from the dataset. It
can also be quickly fine-tuned for even higher accuracy. This approach makes
sophisticated event analysis more accessible and accelerates the pace of
scientific discovery.

Abstract: Ordinary differential equations (ODEs) describe dynamical systems evolving
deterministically in continuous time. Accurate data-driven modeling of systems
as ODEs, a central problem across the natural sciences, remains challenging,
especially if the data is sparse or noisy. We introduce FIM-ODE (Foundation
Inference Model for ODEs), a pretrained neural model designed to estimate ODEs
zero-shot (i.e., in context) from sparse and noisy observations. Trained on
synthetic data, the model utilizes a flexible neural operator for robust ODE
inference, even from corrupted data. We empirically verify that FIM-ODE
provides accurate estimates, on par with a neural state-of-the-art method, and
qualitatively compare the structure of their estimated vector fields.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有表格数据学习方法在处理原始特征和目标感知特征交互方面存在不足，且容易受到噪声影响，需要更鲁棒的深度学习方法。

Method: 采用双流编码器分解特征，结合跨维度自注意力、跨编码自注意力和自适应稀疏自注意力机制，动态抑制低效用标记。

Conclusion: SG-XDEAT通过双流表示学习和自适应稀疏机制，为表格数据学习提供了更鲁棒的深度学习方法。

Abstract: We propose SG-XDEAT (Sparsity-Guided Cross Dimensional and Cross-Encoding
Attention with Target Aware Conditioning), a novel framework designed for
supervised learning on tabular data. At its core, SG-XDEAT employs a
dual-stream encoder that decomposes each input feature into two parallel
representations: a raw value stream and a target-conditioned (label-aware)
stream. These dual representations are then propagated through a hierarchical
stack of attention-based modules. SG-XDEAT integrates three key components: (i)
Cross-Dimensional self-attention, which captures intra-view dependencies among
features within each stream; (ii) Cross-Encoding self-attention, which enables
bidirectional interaction between raw and target-aware representations; and
(iii) an Adaptive Sparse Self-Attention (ASSA) mechanism, which dynamically
suppresses low-utility tokens by driving their attention weights toward
zero--thereby mitigating the impact of noise. Empirical results on multiple
public benchmarks show consistent gains over strong baselines, confirming that
jointly modeling raw and target-aware views--while adaptively filtering
noise--yields a more robust deep tabular learner.

Abstract: Whisper models have achieved remarkable progress in speech recognition; yet
their large size remains a bottleneck for deployment on resource-constrained

Abstract: Spectral clustering is a fundamental method for graph partitioning, but its
reliance on eigenvector computation limits scalability to massive graphs.
Classical sparsification methods preserve spectral properties by sampling edges
proportionally to their effective resistances, but require expensive
preprocessing to estimate these resistances. We study whether uniform edge
sampling-a simple, structure-agnostic strategy-can suffice for spectral
clustering. Our main result shows that for graphs admitting a well-separated
$k$-clustering, characterized by a large structure ratio $\Upsilon(k) =
\lambda_{k+1} / \rho_G(k)$, uniform sampling preserves the spectral subspace
used for clustering. Specifically, we prove that uniformly sampling $O(\gamma^2
n \log n / \epsilon^2)$ edges, where $\gamma$ is the Laplacian condition
number, yields a sparsifier whose top $(n-k)$-dimensional eigenspace is
approximately orthogonal to the cluster indicators. This ensures that the
spectral embedding remains faithful, and clustering quality is preserved. Our
analysis introduces new resistance bounds for intra-cluster edges, a
rank-$(n-k)$ effective resistance formulation, and a matrix Chernoff bound
adapted to the dominant eigenspace. These tools allow us to bypass importance
sampling entirely. Conceptually, our result connects recent coreset-based
clustering theory to spectral sparsification, showing that under strong
clusterability, even uniform sampling is structure-aware. This provides the
first provable guarantee that uniform edge sampling suffices for
structure-preserving spectral clustering.

Abstract: Large Language Models are susceptible to jailbreak attacks that bypass

lightweight approach to AI safety with no additional training data or model
fine-tuning, while incurring only a small computational overhead at inference.

Abstract: Hybrid thinking enables LLMs to switch between reasoning and direct
answering, offering a balance between efficiency and reasoning capability. Yet
our experiments reveal that current hybrid thinking LLMs only achieve partial
mode separation: reasoning behaviors often leak into the no-think mode. To
understand and mitigate this, we analyze the factors influencing
controllability and identify four that matter most: (1) larger data scale, (2)
using think and no-think answers from different questions rather than the same
question, (3) a moderate increase in no-think data number, and (4) a two-phase
strategy that first trains reasoning ability and then applies hybrid think
training. Building on these findings, we propose a practical recipe that,
compared to standard training, can maintain accuracy in both modes while
significantly reducing no-think output length (from $1085$ to $585$ on MATH500)
and occurrences of reasoning-supportive tokens such as ``\texttt{wait}'' (from
$5917$ to $522$ on MATH500). Our findings highlight the limitations of current
hybrid thinking and offer directions for strengthening its controllability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了CoRA框架，通过保持预训练基础模型参数不变，结合Granger因果嵌入和零初始化条件注入机制，有效整合多模态外生协变量，提升时间序列基础模型的预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时间序列基础模型大多在单变量时间序列上预训练，忽略了现实预测任务中来自不同协变量的关键信息，限制了模型性能的进一步提升。

Method: CoRA框架保持预训练基础模型作为冻结特征提取器，使用Granger因果嵌入自动评估协变量与目标变量的因果预测关系，结合零初始化条件注入机制逐步整合外生信息。

Result: 实验表明CoRA在协变量感知预测任务上实现了31.1%的MSE降低，在完整或少量训练样本下均优于现有最优方法，且与多种先进TSFM兼容。

Conclusion: CoRA为时间序列基础模型的应用提供了一个实用的协变量感知适应范式，能够有效整合多模态外生信息而不破坏预训练知识。

Abstract: Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) have shown significant impact through
their model capacity, scalability, and zero-shot generalization. However, due
to the heterogeneity of inter-variate dependencies and the backbone scalability
on large-scale multivariate datasets, most TSFMs are typically pre-trained on
univariate time series. This limitation renders them oblivious to crucial
information from diverse covariates in real-world forecasting tasks. To further
enhance the performance of TSFMs, we propose a general covariate-aware
adaptation (CoRA) framework for TSFMs. It leverages pre-trained backbones of
foundation models while effectively incorporating exogenous covariates from
various modalities, including time series, language, and images, to improve the
quality of predictions. Technically, CoRA maintains the equivalence of
initialization and parameter consistency during adaptation. With preserved
backbones of foundation models as frozen feature extractors, the outcome
embeddings from foundation models are empirically demonstrated more informative
than raw data. Further, CoRA employs a novel Granger Causality Embedding (GCE)
to automatically evaluate covariates regarding their causal predictability with
respect to the target variate. We incorporate these weighted embeddings with a
zero-initialized condition-injection mechanism, avoiding catastrophic
forgetting of pre-trained foundation models and gradually integrates exogenous
information. Extensive experiments show that CoRA of TSFMs surpasses
state-of-the-art covariate-aware deep forecasters with full or few-shot
training samples, achieving 31.1% MSE reduction on covariate-aware forecasting.
Compared to other adaptation methods, CoRA exhibits strong compatibility with
various advanced TSFMs and extends the scope of covariates to other modalities,
presenting a practical paradigm for the application of TSFMs.

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对城际客车异常停靠检测的稀疏感知方法，通过自适应分段、局部时间指示器引导调整和图神经网络，有效解决了GPS轨迹稀疏和标签数据有限的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 城际客车运输中的异常停靠检测对乘客安全和运营可靠性至关重要，但面临GPS轨迹稀疏和标签数据有限两大挑战，现有方法假设密集采样或规则运动模式，适用性受限。

Method: 提出稀疏感知分段方法定义边界，构建三个领域特定指标捕获异常停靠行为，开发局部时间指示器引导调整平滑指标，构建时空图应用标签传播和GCN学习关系模式，最后通过自训练模块迭代改进预测。

Result: 在真实客车数据上的实验显示，仅使用10个标注实例就达到了0.854的AUC和0.866的AP，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了数据稀疏和标签稀缺问题，在异常停靠检测任务上表现出色，代码和数据集已公开。

Abstract: Abnormal stop detection (ASD) in intercity coach transportation is critical
for ensuring passenger safety, operational reliability, and regulatory
compliance. However, two key challenges hinder ASD effectiveness: sparse GPS
trajectories, which obscure short or unauthorized stops, and limited labeled
data, which restricts supervised learning. Existing methods often assume dense
sampling or regular movement patterns, limiting their applicability. To address
data sparsity, we propose a Sparsity-Aware Segmentation (SAS) method that
adaptively defines segment boundaries based on local spatial-temporal density.
Building upon these segments, we introduce three domain-specific indicators to
capture abnormal stop behaviors. To further mitigate the impact of sparsity, we
develop Locally Temporal-Indicator Guided Adjustment (LTIGA), which smooths
these indicators via local similarity graphs. To overcome label scarcity, we
construct a spatial-temporal graph where each segment is a node with
LTIGA-refined features. We apply label propagation to expand weak supervision
across the graph, followed by a GCN to learn relational patterns. A final
self-training module incorporates high-confidence pseudo-labels to iteratively
improve predictions. Experiments on real-world coach data show an AUC of 0.854
and AP of 0.866 using only 10 labeled instances, outperforming prior methods.

Method: 提出DiffEM方法，使用条件扩散模型在E步从观测数据重建干净数据，然后在M步使用重建数据优化条件扩散模型

Result: 理论上在适当统计条件下为DiffEM迭代提供了单调收敛保证，并在各种图像重建任务中验证了方法的有效性

Conclusion: DiffEM方法能够有效地从损坏数据中训练扩散模型，为高维逆问题提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as powerful generative priors for
high-dimensional inverse problems, yet learning them when only corrupted or
noisy observations are available remains challenging. In this work, we propose
a new method for training diffusion models with Expectation-Maximization (EM)
from corrupted data. Our proposed method, DiffEM, utilizes conditional
diffusion models to reconstruct clean data from observations in the E-step, and
then uses the reconstructed data to refine the conditional diffusion model in
the M-step. Theoretically, we provide monotonic convergence guarantees for the
DiffEM iteration, assuming appropriate statistical conditions. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of our approach through experiments on various image
reconstruction tasks.

Abstract: This paper explores the topological signatures of ReLU neural network
activation patterns. We consider feedforward neural networks with ReLU
activation functions and analyze the polytope decomposition of the feature
space induced by the network. Mainly, we investigate how the Fiedler partition
of the dual graph and show that it appears to correlate with the decision
boundary -- in the case of binary classification. Additionally, we compute the
homology of the cellular decomposition -- in a regression task -- to draw
similar patterns in behavior between the training loss and polyhedral
cell-count, as the model is trained.

Abstract: Chemical pretrained models, sometimes referred to as foundation models, are
receiving considerable interest for drug discovery applications. The general
chemical knowledge extracted from self-supervised training has the potential to
improve predictions for critical drug discovery endpoints, including on-target
potency and ADMET properties. Multi-task learning has previously been
successfully leveraged to improve predictive models. Here, we show that
enabling multitasking in finetuning of chemical pretrained graph neural network
models such as Kinetic GROVER Multi-Task (KERMT), an enhanced version of the
GROVER model, and Knowledge-guided Pre-training of Graph Transformer (KGPT)
significantly improves performance over non-pretrained graph neural network
models. Surprisingly, we find that the performance improvement from finetuning
KERMT in a multitask manner is most significant at larger data sizes.
Additionally, we publish two multitask ADMET data splits to enable more
accurate benchmarking of multitask deep learning methods for drug property
prediction. Finally, we provide an accelerated implementation of the KERMT
model on GitHub, unlocking large-scale pretraining, finetuning, and inference
in industrial drug discovery workflows.

TL;DR: CARVQ是一种结合线性与非线性映射的嵌入层压缩方法，可将LLM嵌入层压缩至约1.6比特，适用于边缘设备部署。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的嵌入层参数庞大，导致存储需求和内存占用过高，特别是在边缘设备上成为内存瓶颈，需要压缩嵌入层以减少内存占用并加速推理。

Method: 提出CARVQ方法，结合校正适配器和分组残差向量量化，通过线性和非线性映射组合来压缩嵌入层，无需专用硬件支持低位存储。

Result: 在多个预训练LLM上测试，CARVQ在大多数情况下能实现更低的平均比特率，同时保持合理的困惑度和准确性，相比标量量化表现更好。

Conclusion: CARVQ是一种与先进Transformer量化方法兼容的压缩技术，可无缝集成到支持4位内存的任何硬件中，是实现LLM在边缘设备高效部署的关键步骤。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) typically rely on a large number of parameters
for token embedding, leading to substantial storage requirements and memory
footprints. In particular, LLMs deployed on edge devices are memory-bound, and
reducing the memory footprint by compressing the embedding layer not only frees
up the memory bandwidth but also speeds up inference. To address this, we
introduce CARVQ, a post-training novel Corrective Adaptor combined with group
Residual Vector Quantization. CARVQ relies on the composition of both linear
and non-linear maps and mimics the original model embedding to compress to
approximately 1.6 bits without requiring specialized hardware to support
lower-bit storage. We test our method on pre-trained LLMs such as LLaMA-3.2-1B,
LLaMA-3.2-3B, LLaMA-3.2-3B-Instruct, LLaMA-3.1-8B, Qwen2.5-7B, Qwen2.5-Math-7B
and Phi-4, evaluating on common generative, discriminative, math and reasoning
tasks. We show that in most cases, CARVQ can achieve lower average
bitwidth-per-parameter while maintaining reasonable perplexity and accuracy
compared to scalar quantization. Our contributions include a novel compression
technique that is compatible with state-of-the-art transformer quantization
methods and can be seamlessly integrated into any hardware supporting 4-bit
memory to reduce the model's memory footprint in memory-constrained devices.
This work demonstrates a crucial step toward the efficient deployment of LLMs
on edge devices.

Motivation: 决策树学习算法通常包含启发式局部搜索操作，但缺乏对这些操作计算复杂度的系统分析。研究旨在确定哪些问题特性导致计算困难，哪些特性使问题易于处理。

Method: 采用参数化复杂度分析方法，研究在固定操作次数下最小化分类错误的问题。特别关注特征数量d和域大小D的组合对计算复杂度的影响。

Result: 发现当特征数量d和域大小D都很小时，问题具有固定参数可解性，可在(D+1)^(2d) · |I|^O(1)时间内求解。提供了概念验证实现和实证结果。

Conclusion: 决策树局部搜索优化问题在一般情况下是NP完全的，但当特征数量和域大小都很小时，可以通过参数化算法高效求解，这为实际应用提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Algorithms for learning decision trees often include heuristic local-search
operations such as (1) adjusting the threshold of a cut or (2) also exchanging
the feature of that cut. We study minimizing the number of classification
errors by performing a fixed number of a single type of these operations.
Although we discover that the corresponding problems are NP-complete in
general, we provide a comprehensive parameterized-complexity analysis with the
aim of determining those properties of the problems that explain the hardness
and those that make the problems tractable. For instance, we show that the
problems remain hard for a small number $d$ of features or small domain size
$D$ but the combination of both yields fixed-parameter tractability. That is,
the problems are solvable in $(D + 1)^{2d} \cdot |I|^{O(1)}$ time, where $|I|$
is the size of the input. We also provide a proof-of-concept implementation of
this algorithm and report on empirical results.

Abstract: In this paper, we presents a novel hierarchical federated learning
architecture specifically designed for smart agricultural production systems
and crop yield prediction. Our approach introduces a seasonal subscription
mechanism where farms join crop-specific clusters at the beginning of each
agricultural season. The proposed three-layer architecture consists of
individual smart farms at the client level, crop-specific aggregators at the
middle layer, and a global model aggregator at the top level. Within each crop
cluster, clients collaboratively train specialized models tailored to specific
crop types, which are then aggregated to produce a higher-level global model
that integrates knowledge across multiple crops. This hierarchical design
enables both local specialization for individual crop types and global
generalization across diverse agricultural contexts while preserving data
privacy and reducing communication overhead. Experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed system, showing that local and crop-layer models
closely follow actual yield patterns with consistent alignment, significantly
outperforming standard machine learning models. The results validate the
advantages of hierarchical federated learning in the agricultural context,
particularly for scenarios involving heterogeneous farming environments and
privacy-sensitive agricultural data.

Motivation: 传统变量重要性方法依赖于单一模型和观测到的特征，但变量重要性受到模型中包含的其他变量影响，且重要变量经常在观测数据中被遗漏。此外，不同但同样好的模型可能给出不同的变量重要性（Rashomon效应）。

Method: 引入UNIVERSE方法，通过调整Rashomon集合（数据集中的近似最优模型集合）来估计变量重要性，即使在存在缺失特征的情况下也能为真实变量重要性提供边界。

Result: 该方法在理论上有鲁棒性保证，在半合成模拟中表现良好，并在信用风险评估任务中展示了其实用性。

Conclusion: UNIVERSE方法能够处理变量重要性分析中的未观测变量问题和Rashomon效应，为真实变量重要性提供更可靠的估计边界。

Abstract: Variable importance (VI) methods are often used for hypothesis generation,
feature selection, and scientific validation. In the standard VI pipeline, an
analyst estimates VI for a single predictive model with only the observed
features. However, the importance of a feature depends heavily on which other
variables are included in the model, and essential variables are often omitted
from observational datasets. Moreover, the VI estimated for one model is often
not the same as the VI estimated for another equally-good model - a phenomenon
known as the Rashomon Effect. We address these gaps by introducing
UNobservables and Inference for Variable importancE using Rashomon SEts
(UNIVERSE). Our approach adapts Rashomon sets - the sets of near-optimal models
in a dataset - to produce bounds on the true VI even with missing features. We
theoretically guarantee the robustness of our approach, show strong performance
on semi-synthetic simulations, and demonstrate its utility in a credit risk
task.

Motivation: 深度神经网络极易受到对抗性攻击，这对安全和关键应用构成重大风险，需要轻量级、即插即用的检测解决方案。

Conclusion: KoALA是一种轻量级、即插即用的对抗性检测解决方案，适用于现有模型和多种数据模态，无需架构修改或对抗训练。

Abstract: Deep neural networks are highly susceptible to adversarial attacks, which
pose significant risks to security- and safety-critical applications. We
present KoALA (KL-L0 Adversarial detection via Label Agreement), a novel,
semantics-free adversarial detector that requires no architectural changes or
adversarial retraining. KoALA operates on a simple principle: it detects an
adversarial attack when class predictions from two complementary similarity
metrics disagree. These metrics-KL divergence and an L0-based similarity-are
specifically chosen to detect different types of perturbations. The KL
divergence metric is sensitive to dense, low-amplitude shifts, while the
L0-based similarity is designed for sparse, high-impact changes. We provide a
formal proof of correctness for our approach. The only training required is a
simple fine-tuning step on a pre-trained image encoder using clean images to
ensure the embeddings align well with both metrics. This makes KOALA a
lightweight, plug-and-play solution for existing models and various data
modalities. Our extensive experiments on ResNet/CIFAR-10 and CLIP/Tiny-ImageNet
confirm our theoretical claims. When the theorem's conditions are met, KoALA
consistently and effectively detects adversarial examples. On the full test
sets, KoALA achieves a precision of 0.94 and a recall of 0.81 on
ResNet/CIFAR-10, and a precision of 0.66 and a recall of 0.85 on
CLIP/Tiny-ImageNet.

TL;DR: 本文研究如何构建概率预测，使其在下游用户决策时能产生准确结果。针对多决策者场景，提出了比现有方法更优的样本高效算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有omniprediction方法存在局限性：基于multicalibration的方法样本复杂度次优，而基于对抗游戏的方法会产生复杂随机化预测器。需要设计更直接、非随机化的高效算法。

Method: 提出了一种直接的非随机化算法，利用proper losses集合的结构特性，改进了现有的在线到批量转换方法。

Result: 证明了multicalibration是比omniprediction更困难的问题，因此基于multicalibration的方法必然有次优样本复杂度。新算法在样本效率上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 通过利用proper losses的结构特性，设计出了更直接、非随机化的样本高效算法，解决了多决策者场景下预测器设计的挑战。

Abstract: We consider the problem of constructing probabilistic predictions that lead
to accurate decisions when employed by downstream users to inform actions. For
a single decision maker, designing an optimal predictor is equivalent to
minimizing a proper loss function corresponding to the negative utility of that
individual. For multiple decision makers, our problem can be viewed as a
variant of omniprediction in which the goal is to design a single predictor
that simultaneously minimizes multiple losses. Existing algorithms for
achieving omniprediction broadly fall into two categories: 1) boosting methods
that optimize other auxiliary targets such as multicalibration and obtain
omniprediction as a corollary, and 2) adversarial two-player game based
approaches that estimate and respond to the ``worst-case" loss in an online
fashion. We give lower bounds demonstrating that multicalibration is a strictly
more difficult problem than omniprediction and thus the former approach must
incur suboptimal sample complexity. For the latter approach, we discuss how
these ideas can be used to obtain a sample-efficient algorithm through an
online-to-batch conversion. This conversion has the downside of returning a
complex, randomized predictor. We improve on this method by designing a more
direct, unrandomized algorithm that exploits structural elements of the set of
proper losses.
