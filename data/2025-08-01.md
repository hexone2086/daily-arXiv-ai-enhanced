Abstract: This paper introduces a novel benchmark, EGE-Math Solutions Assessment
Benchmark, for evaluating Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on their ability to
assess hand-written mathematical solutions. Unlike existing benchmarks that
focus on problem solving, our approach centres on understanding student
solutions, identifying mistakes, and assigning grades according to fixed
criteria. We compile 122 scanned solutions from the Russian Unified State Exam
(EGE) together with official expert grades, and evaluate seven modern VLMs from
Google, OpenAI, Arcee AI, and Alibaba Cloud in three inference modes. The
results reveal current limitations in mathematical reasoning and human-rubric
alignment, opening new research avenues in AI-assisted assessment. You can find

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多视角捕获中城市场景重建的效率、鲁棒性和视觉保真度问题。

Method: 采用场景分区并行训练、可见性图像选择、可控LOD策略、外观变换模块及增强模块（深度正则化、尺度正则化、抗锯齿）。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在效率和质量上优于现有方法，成功重建城市场景。

Conclusion: 该框架在城市场景重建中实现了高效、高保真和鲁棒性，代码已开源。

Abstract: We present a framework that enables fast reconstruction and real-time
rendering of urban-scale scenes while maintaining robustness against appearance
variations across multi-view captures. Our approach begins with scene
partitioning for parallel training, employing a visibility-based image
selection strategy to optimize training efficiency. A controllable
level-of-detail (LOD) strategy explicitly regulates Gaussian density under a
user-defined budget, enabling efficient training and rendering while
maintaining high visual fidelity. The appearance transformation module
mitigates the negative effects of appearance inconsistencies across images
while enabling flexible adjustments. Additionally, we utilize enhancement
modules, such as depth regularization, scale regularization, and antialiasing,
to improve reconstruction fidelity. Experimental results demonstrate that our
method effectively reconstructs urban-scale scenes and outperforms previous
approaches in both efficiency and quality. The source code is available at:

### [3] [Modeling Human Gaze Behavior with Diffusion Models for Unified Scanpath Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23021)
*Giuseppe Cartella,Vittorio Cuculo,Alessandro D'Amelio,Marcella Cornia,Giuseppe Boccignone,Rita Cucchiara*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ScanDiff结合扩散模型和Vision Transformers，生成多样且真实的人类注视扫描路径，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习模型生成平均行为，无法捕捉人类视觉探索的变异性，ScanDiff旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 利用扩散模型的随机性和Vision Transformers，结合文本条件生成任务驱动的扫描路径。

Result: 在基准数据集上，ScanDiff在自由观看和任务驱动场景中均优于现有方法，生成更多样且准确的扫描路径。

Conclusion: ScanDiff能更好地捕捉人类视觉行为的复杂性，推动注视预测研究。

Abstract: Predicting human gaze scanpaths is crucial for understanding visual
attention, with applications in human-computer interaction, autonomous systems,
and cognitive robotics. While deep learning models have advanced scanpath
prediction, most existing approaches generate averaged behaviors, failing to
capture the variability of human visual exploration. In this work, we present
ScanDiff, a novel architecture that combines diffusion models with Vision
Transformers to generate diverse and realistic scanpaths. Our method explicitly
models scanpath variability by leveraging the stochastic nature of diffusion
models, producing a wide range of plausible gaze trajectories. Additionally, we
introduce textual conditioning to enable task-driven scanpath generation,
allowing the model to adapt to different visual search objectives. Experiments
on benchmark datasets show that ScanDiff surpasses state-of-the-art methods in
both free-viewing and task-driven scenarios, producing more diverse and
accurate scanpaths. These results highlight its ability to better capture the
complexity of human visual behavior, pushing forward gaze prediction research.

### [4] [Recovering Diagnostic Value: Super-Resolution-Aided Echocardiographic Classification in Resource-Constrained Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23027)
*Krishan Agyakari Raja Babu,Om Prabhu,Annu,Mohanasankar Sivaprakasam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文探讨了深度学习超分辨率技术（SR）在提升低质量超声心动图分类准确性中的应用，尤其在资源受限环境中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 资源受限环境中超声心动图质量差，影响诊断模型效果，而超分辨率技术在此领域的应用尚未充分探索。

Method: 使用SRGAN和SRResNet两种超分辨率模型处理低质量图像，并在CAMUS数据集上评估两种分类任务（2CH vs. 4CH和ED vs. ES）。

Result: SRResNet显著提升了分类性能，同时计算效率高。

Conclusion: 超分辨率技术能有效恢复低质量超声心动图的诊断价值，适用于资源受限环境中的AI辅助诊断。

Abstract: Automated cardiac interpretation in resource-constrained settings (RCS) is
often hindered by poor-quality echocardiographic imaging, limiting the
effectiveness of downstream diagnostic models. While super-resolution (SR)
techniques have shown promise in enhancing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and
computed tomography (CT) scans, their application to echocardiography-a widely
accessible but noise-prone modality-remains underexplored. In this work, we
investigate the potential of deep learning-based SR to improve classification
accuracy on low-quality 2D echocardiograms. Using the publicly available CAMUS
dataset, we stratify samples by image quality and evaluate two clinically
relevant tasks of varying complexity: a relatively simple Two-Chamber vs.
Four-Chamber (2CH vs. 4CH) view classification and a more complex End-Diastole
vs. End-Systole (ED vs. ES) phase classification. We apply two widely used SR
models-Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network (SRGAN) and
Super-Resolution Residual Network (SRResNet), to enhance poor-quality images
and observe significant gains in performance metric-particularly with SRResNet,
which also offers computational efficiency. Our findings demonstrate that SR
can effectively recover diagnostic value in degraded echo scans, making it a
viable tool for AI-assisted care in RCS, achieving more with less.

### [5] [Adaptive Time-step Training for Enhancing Spike-Based Neural Radiance Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23033)
*Ranxi Lin,Canming Yao,Jiayi Li,Weihang Liu,Xin Lou,Pingqiang Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于脉冲神经网络的动态时间步长调整策略（PATA），在保持渲染质量的同时显著减少计算资源消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决NeRF模型在密集点采样时计算资源消耗大的问题，特别是在边缘计算等资源受限场景中的应用限制。

Method: 采用脉冲神经网络（SNN）和动态时间步长训练策略（PATA），自动平衡渲染质量与时间步长，实现场景自适应推理。

Result: 实验显示，PATA在保持渲染质量的同时，推理时间步长减少64%，运行功耗降低61.55%。

Conclusion: PATA为资源受限场景下的高效神经渲染提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF)-based models have achieved remarkable success
in 3D reconstruction and rendering tasks. However, during both training and
inference, these models rely heavily on dense point sampling along rays from
multiple viewpoints, resulting in a surge in floating-point operations and
severely limiting their use in resource-constrained scenarios like edge
computing. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), which communicate via binary spikes
over discrete time steps, offer a promising alternative due to their
energy-efficient nature. Given the inherent variability in scene scale and
texture complexity in neural rendering and the prevailing practice of training
separate models per scene, we propose a spike-based NeRF framework with a
dynamic time step training strategy, termed Pretrain-Adaptive Time-step
Adjustment (PATA). This approach automatically explores the trade-off between
rendering quality and time step length during training. Consequently, it
enables scene-adaptive inference with variable time steps and reduces the
additional consumption of computational resources in the inference process.
Anchoring to the established Instant-NGP architecture, we evaluate our method
across diverse datasets. The experimental results show that PATA can preserve
rendering fidelity while reducing inference time steps by 64\% and running
power by 61.55\%.

### [6] [Early Goal-Guided Multi-Scale Fusion for Real-Time Vision-Language Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23042)
*Santosh Patapati,Trisanth Srinivasan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NovaDrive是一种单分支视觉语言架构，通过处理多模态输入（图像、地图、LiDAR和文本路径点）实现高效自动驾驶，成功率和路径效率显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶车辆需快速反应并处理复杂道路和交通意图，现有方法依赖循环记忆且效率不足。

Method: 采用单分支架构，结合两阶段交叉注意力块对齐路径点与地图，并细化图像和深度信息，辅以平滑损失函数避免突变。

Result: 在nuScenes/Waymo子集上，成功率提升4%，路径效率提升0.11，碰撞频率降低1.4%。

Conclusion: NovaDrive通过多模态融合和优化损失函数，实现了高效、安全的自动驾驶，并可扩展至其他领域。

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles must react in milliseconds while reasoning about road
geometry and traffic intent to navigate complex situations. We introduce
NovaDrive, a single-branch vision-language architecture that processes
front-camera images, HD-map tiles, LiDAR depth, and textual waypoints in a
single branch. A lightweight, two-stage cross-attention block first aligns
waypoint tokens with the HD map, then refines attention over fine-grained image
and depth patches. Coupled with a novel smoothness loss that discourages abrupt
steering and speed changes, this design eliminates the need for recurrent
memory. We fine-tune the top 15 layers of an 11B LLaMA-3.2 vision-language
backbone, enabling real-time inference. On the nuScenes / Waymo subset of the
MD-NEX Outdoor benchmark, NovaDrive raises success rate to 84% (+4%), boosts
path-efficiency (SPL) to 0.66 (+0.11), and reduces collision frequency from
2.6% to 1.2% (-1.4%) relative to the previous state-of-the-art. Our ablations
confirm that waypoint tokens, partial VLM fine-tuning, and the cross-attention
fusion each contribute the most to these gains. Beyond safety, NovaDrive's
shorter routes (resulting from the novel smoothness loss) translate to lower
fuel or battery usage, pointing toward leaner, more easily updated driving
stacks. NovaDrive can be extended to other embodied-AI domains as well.

### [7] [Reference-Guided Diffusion Inpainting For Multimodal Counterfactual Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23058)
*Alexandru Buburuzan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了两种合成数据生成方法MObI和AnydoorMed，分别用于自动驾驶和医学图像分析，通过扩散模型实现高真实性和可控性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于真实数据收集成本高且复杂，合成数据方法在安全关键应用中变得重要，但需要高真实性和可控性。

Method: MObI利用扩散模型实现多模态对象修复，支持3D定位；AnydoorMed扩展至医学图像，实现参考引导的异常修复。

Result: 两种方法展示了在多模态场景中生成高真实性和可控性合成数据的能力。

Conclusion: 这些方法为构建高度真实、可控的多模态反事实场景奠定了基础。

Abstract: Safety-critical applications, such as autonomous driving and medical image
analysis, require extensive multimodal data for rigorous testing. Synthetic
data methods are gaining prominence due to the cost and complexity of gathering
real-world data, but they demand a high degree of realism and controllability
to be useful. This work introduces two novel methods for synthetic data
generation in autonomous driving and medical image analysis, namely MObI and
AnydoorMed, respectively. MObI is a first-of-its-kind framework for Multimodal
Object Inpainting that leverages a diffusion model to produce realistic and
controllable object inpaintings across perceptual modalities, demonstrated
simultaneously for camera and lidar. Given a single reference RGB image, MObI
enables seamless object insertion into existing multimodal scenes at a
specified 3D location, guided by a bounding box, while maintaining semantic
consistency and multimodal coherence. Unlike traditional inpainting methods
that rely solely on edit masks, this approach uses 3D bounding box conditioning
to ensure accurate spatial positioning and realistic scaling. AnydoorMed
extends this paradigm to the medical imaging domain, focusing on
reference-guided inpainting for mammography scans. It leverages a
diffusion-based model to inpaint anomalies with impressive detail preservation,
maintaining the reference anomaly's structural integrity while semantically
blending it with the surrounding tissue. Together, these methods demonstrate
that foundation models for reference-guided inpainting in natural images can be
readily adapted to diverse perceptual modalities, paving the way for the next
generation of systems capable of constructing highly realistic, controllable
and multimodal counterfactual scenarios.

### [8] [Vision-Language Fusion for Real-Time Autonomous Driving: Goal-Centered Cross-Attention of Camera, HD-Map, & Waypoints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23064)
*Santosh Patapati,Trisanth Srinivasan,Murari Ambati*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: XYZ-Drive是一个结合视觉和语言的单分支模型，用于自动驾驶，通过目标中心交叉注意力层融合图像、地图和路径点信息，显著提升了驾驶成功率和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶需要同时处理几何精度和语义理解，但现有方法通常将它们分开处理。XYZ-Drive旨在通过单一模型实现两者的融合。

Method: 使用轻量级目标中心交叉注意力层融合图像、地图和路径点信息，并通过部分微调的LLaMA-3.2 11B模型输出驾驶指令。

Result: 在MD-NEX Outdoor-Driving基准测试中，XYZ-Drive达到95%的成功率和0.80 SPL，超越PhysNav-DG 15%，碰撞率减半。

Conclusion: 早期基于令牌级别的意图和地图布局融合能够实现准确、透明且实时的自动驾驶。

Abstract: Autonomous cars need geometric accuracy and semantic understanding to
navigate complex environments, yet most stacks handle them separately. We
present XYZ-Drive, a single vision-language model that reads a front-camera
frame, a 25m $\times$ 25m overhead map, and the next waypoint, then outputs
steering and speed. A lightweight goal-centered cross-attention layer lets
waypoint tokens highlight relevant image and map patches, supporting both
action and textual explanations, before the fused tokens enter a partially
fine-tuned LLaMA-3.2 11B model.
  On the MD-NEX Outdoor-Driving benchmark XYZ-Drive attains 95% success and
0.80 Success weighted by Path Length (SPL), surpassing PhysNav-DG by 15%. and
halving collisions, all while significantly improving efficiency by using only
a single branch. Sixteen ablations explain the gains. Removing any modality
(vision, waypoint, map) drops success by up to 11%, confirming their
complementary roles and rich connections. Replacing goal-centered attention
with simple concatenation cuts 3% in performance, showing query-based fusion
injects map knowledge more effectively. Keeping the transformer frozen loses
5%, showing the importance of fine-tuning when applying VLMs for specific tasks
such as autonomous driving. Coarsening map resolution from 10 cm to 40 cm blurs
lane edges and raises crash rate.
  Overall, these results demonstrate that early, token-level fusion of intent
and map layout enables accurate, transparent, real-time driving.

### [9] [Vocabulary-free Fine-grained Visual Recognition via Enriched Contextually Grounded Vision-Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23070)
*Dmitry Demidov,Zaigham Zaheer,Omkar Thawakar,Salman Khan,Fahad Shahbaz Khan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种无需训练的细粒度图像分类方法E-FineR，结合大语言模型和视觉语言模型，实现了开放集识别，并在零样本和少样本分类中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统细粒度图像分类方法依赖固定词汇和封闭集分类，难以适应现实世界中新类别的出现。现有方法未能充分利用大语言模型的潜力，且依赖猜测的类别名称。

Method: 提出E-FineR方法，无需训练，结合大语言模型和视觉语言模型，通过语言驱动的理解实现分类。

Result: E-FineR在细粒度视觉识别中达到最先进水平，并在零样本和少样本分类中表现优异。

Conclusion: E-FineR支持从刚性标签预测转向灵活的语言驱动理解，适用于现实世界应用。

Abstract: Fine-grained image classification, the task of distinguishing between
visually similar subcategories within a broader category (e.g., bird species,
car models, flower types), is a challenging computer vision problem.
Traditional approaches rely heavily on fixed vocabularies and closed-set
classification paradigms, limiting their scalability and adaptability in
real-world settings where novel classes frequently emerge. Recent research has
demonstrated that combining large language models (LLMs) with vision-language
models (VLMs) makes open-set recognition possible without the need for
predefined class labels. However, the existing methods are often limited in
harnessing the power of LLMs at the classification phase, and also rely heavily
on the guessed class names provided by an LLM without thorough analysis and
refinement. To address these bottlenecks, we propose our training-free method,
Enriched-FineR (or E-FineR for short), which demonstrates state-of-the-art
results in fine-grained visual recognition while also offering greater
interpretability, highlighting its strong potential in real-world scenarios and
new domains where expert annotations are difficult to obtain. Additionally, we
demonstrate the application of our proposed approach to zero-shot and few-shot
classification, where it demonstrated performance on par with the existing SOTA
while being training-free and not requiring human interventions. Overall, our
vocabulary-free framework supports the shift in image classification from rigid
label prediction to flexible, language-driven understanding, enabling scalable
and generalizable systems for real-world applications. Well-documented code is
available on https://github.com/demidovd98/e-finer.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的开放词汇3D实例分割（OV-3DIS）方法，通过结合多种互补概念并优化关键挑战，实现了两阶段方案：3D提案生成和实例分类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有开放词汇3D实例分割方法虽然提出了多种概念，但这些概念并非互斥而是互补的。本文旨在通过整合这些概念并解决关键问题，提升性能。

Method: 采用两阶段方案：1）通过3D跟踪聚合生成提案，并通过迭代合并/移除处理重叠或部分提案；2）使用Alpha-CLIP替代标准CLIP，减少背景噪声，并引入标准化最大相似度（SMS）分数提升分类精度。

Result: 在ScanNet200和S3DIS数据集上，该方法在所有AP和AR指标上均达到最优性能，甚至超过封闭词汇的端到端方法。

Conclusion: 通过整合互补概念并优化关键步骤，本文提出的方法显著提升了开放词汇3D实例分割的性能，成为新的SOTA解决方案。

Abstract: Unlike closed-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation that is often trained
end-to-end, open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation (OV-3DIS) often leverages
vision-language models (VLMs) to generate 3D instance proposals and classify
them. While various concepts have been proposed from existing research, we
observe that these individual concepts are not mutually exclusive but
complementary. In this paper, we propose a new state-of-the-art solution for
OV-3DIS by carefully designing a recipe to combine the concepts together and
refining them to address key challenges. Our solution follows the two-stage
scheme: 3D proposal generation and instance classification. We employ robust 3D
tracking-based proposal aggregation to generate 3D proposals and remove
overlapped or partial proposals by iterative merging/removal. For the
classification stage, we replace the standard CLIP model with Alpha-CLIP, which
incorporates object masks as an alpha channel to reduce background noise and
obtain object-centric representation. Additionally, we introduce the
standardized maximum similarity (SMS) score to normalize text-to-proposal
similarity, effectively filtering out false positives and boosting precision.
Our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on ScanNet200 and S3DIS
across all AP and AR metrics, even surpassing an end-to-end closed-vocabulary
method.

### [11] [X-NeMo: Expressive Neural Motion Reenactment via Disentangled Latent Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23143)
*Xiaochen Zhao,Hongyi Xu,Guoxian Song,You Xie,Chenxu Zhang,Xiu Li,Linjie Luo,Jinli Suo,Yebin Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: X-NeMo是一种基于扩散的零样本肖像动画方法，通过驱动视频的面部动作生成静态肖像动画，解决了身份泄漏和表情捕捉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法中身份泄漏和难以捕捉细微或极端表情的问题。

Method: 提出端到端训练框架，提取1D身份无关的运动描述符，通过交叉注意力控制图像生成。

Result: 实验表明X-NeMo优于现有方法，生成高表现力且身份相似的动画。

Conclusion: X-NeMo通过创新的运动描述符和训练框架，显著提升了肖像动画的质量。

Abstract: We propose X-NeMo, a novel zero-shot diffusion-based portrait animation
pipeline that animates a static portrait using facial movements from a driving
video of a different individual. Our work first identifies the root causes of
the key issues in prior approaches, such as identity leakage and difficulty in
capturing subtle and extreme expressions. To address these challenges, we
introduce a fully end-to-end training framework that distills a 1D
identity-agnostic latent motion descriptor from driving image, effectively
controlling motion through cross-attention during image generation. Our
implicit motion descriptor captures expressive facial motion in fine detail,
learned end-to-end from a diverse video dataset without reliance on pretrained
motion detectors. We further enhance expressiveness and disentangle motion
latents from identity cues by supervising their learning with a dual GAN
decoder, alongside spatial and color augmentations. By embedding the driving
motion into a 1D latent vector and controlling motion via cross-attention
rather than additive spatial guidance, our design eliminates the transmission
of spatial-aligned structural clues from the driving condition to the diffusion
backbone, substantially mitigating identity leakage. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that X-NeMo surpasses state-of-the-art baselines, producing highly
expressive animations with superior identity resemblance. Our code and models
are available for research.

### [12] [Neural Multi-View Self-Calibrated Photometric Stereo without Photometric Stereo Cues](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23162)
*Xu Cao,Takafumi Taketomi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种神经逆向渲染方法，从多视角图像中联合重建几何、空间变化反射率和光照条件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统多视角光度立体方法需要光照校准或中间线索（如每视角法线图）的问题。

Method: 使用神经隐式场表示几何和反射率，并应用阴影感知体积渲染。通过空间网络预测有符号距离和反射率潜在码，反射率网络估计反射率值。

Result: 在形状和光照估计精度上优于现有方法，适用于视角未对齐的多光源图像，并能处理复杂几何和反射率的物体。

Conclusion: 该方法无需中间线索，单阶段优化所有场景参数，性能优越且通用性强。

Abstract: We propose a neural inverse rendering approach that jointly reconstructs
geometry, spatially varying reflectance, and lighting conditions from
multi-view images captured under varying directional lighting. Unlike prior
multi-view photometric stereo methods that require light calibration or
intermediate cues such as per-view normal maps, our method jointly optimizes
all scene parameters from raw images in a single stage. We represent both
geometry and reflectance as neural implicit fields and apply shadow-aware
volume rendering. A spatial network first predicts the signed distance and a
reflectance latent code for each scene point. A reflectance network then
estimates reflectance values conditioned on the latent code and angularly
encoded surface normal, view, and light directions. The proposed method
outperforms state-of-the-art normal-guided approaches in shape and lighting
estimation accuracy, generalizes to view-unaligned multi-light images, and
handles objects with challenging geometry and reflectance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合Corner Loss和R-CBAM模块的图像去雨网络，显著提升了去雨效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单图像去雨问题不仅需要抑制噪声，还需保留细节和视觉质量。

Method: 引入Corner Loss防止边界和纹理信息丢失，并使用R-CBAM模块动态调整特征重要性。

Result: 在Rain100L和Rain100H数据集上PSNR分别达到33.29 dB和26.16 dB，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了去雨效果，同时保留了图像细节。

Abstract: The problem of single-image rain streak removal goes beyond simple noise
suppression, requiring the simultaneous preservation of fine structural details
and overall visual quality. In this study, we propose a novel image restoration
network that effectively constrains the restoration process by introducing a
Corner Loss, which prevents the loss of object boundaries and detailed texture
information during restoration. Furthermore, we propose a Residual
Convolutional Block Attention Module (R-CBAM) Block into the encoder and
decoder to dynamically adjust the importance of features in both spatial and
channel dimensions, enabling the network to focus more effectively on regions
heavily affected by rain streaks. Quantitative evaluations conducted on the
Rain100L and Rain100H datasets demonstrate that the proposed method
significantly outperforms previous approaches, achieving a PSNR of 33.29 dB on
Rain100L and 26.16 dB on Rain100H.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种多模态运动检索框架，通过细粒度联合嵌入空间对齐文本、音频、视频和运动四种模态，显著提升了检索性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法缺乏直观的用户交互模式，且未充分利用模态的序列表示。

Method: 采用序列级对比学习方法，构建四模态联合嵌入空间，并首次引入音频模态。

Conclusion: 多模态运动检索框架在运动获取方面具有显著潜力，四模态优于三模态。

Abstract: Motion retrieval is crucial for motion acquisition, offering superior
precision, realism, controllability, and editability compared to motion
generation. Existing approaches leverage contrastive learning to construct a
unified embedding space for motion retrieval from text or visual modality.
However, these methods lack a more intuitive and user-friendly interaction mode
and often overlook the sequential representation of most modalities for
improved retrieval performance. To address these limitations, we propose a
framework that aligns four modalities -- text, audio, video, and motion --
within a fine-grained joint embedding space, incorporating audio for the first
time in motion retrieval to enhance user immersion and convenience. This
fine-grained space is achieved through a sequence-level contrastive learning
approach, which captures critical details across modalities for better
alignment. To evaluate our framework, we augment existing text-motion datasets
with synthetic but diverse audio recordings, creating two multi-modal motion
retrieval datasets. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance over
state-of-the-art methods across multiple sub-tasks, including an 10.16%
improvement in R@10 for text-to-motion retrieval and a 25.43% improvement in
R@1 for video-to-motion retrieval on the HumanML3D dataset. Furthermore, our
results show that our 4-modal framework significantly outperforms its 3-modal
counterpart, underscoring the potential of multi-modal motion retrieval for
advancing motion acquisition.

TL;DR: 该研究介绍了一个用于卫星图像洪水区域分割的新数据集，填补了现有基准的不足，并在实验中展示了模型的初步结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有卫星图像基准中缺乏适合洪水区域分割的数据集，因此需要构建一个专用数据集。

Method: 从Planet Labs收集2019年美国中西部洪水的卫星图像，处理为统一分辨率，并测试了多种语义分割模型。

Result: 模型表现一般，表明未来需要多模态和时间学习策略。

Conclusion: 数据集将公开，为洪水区域分割研究提供资源，并指出未来改进方向。

Abstract: This study introduces a novel dataset for segmenting flooded areas in
satellite images. After reviewing 77 existing benchmarks utilizing satellite
imagery, we identified a shortage of suitable datasets for this specific task.
To fill this gap, we collected satellite imagery of the 2019 Midwestern USA
floods from Planet Explorer by Planet Labs (Image \c{opyright} 2024 Planet Labs
PBC). The dataset consists of 10 satellite images per location, each containing
both flooded and non-flooded areas. We selected ten locations from each of the
five states: Iowa, Kansas, Montana, Nebraska, and South Dakota. The dataset
ensures uniform resolution and resizing during data processing. For evaluating
semantic segmentation performance, we tested state-of-the-art models in
computer vision and remote sensing on our dataset. Additionally, we conducted
an ablation study varying window sizes to capture temporal characteristics.
Overall, the models demonstrated modest results, suggesting a requirement for
future multimodal and temporal learning strategies. The dataset will be
publicly available on
<https://github.com/youngsunjang/SDSU_MidWest_Flood_2019>.

*Chengwei Xia,Fan Ma,Ruijie Quan,Kun Zhan,Yi Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于扩散模型的对抗攻击方法（AGD），通过在全频段噪声中嵌入对抗信号，欺骗多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）生成目标响应，同时保持图像的视觉质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统对抗攻击方法通常在高频段嵌入扰动，容易被防御措施（如低通滤波）抑制。AGD旨在通过利用扩散模型的全频段噪声特性，提高对抗攻击的鲁棒性。

Method: 采用对抗引导扩散（AGD）方法，将目标语义注入反向扩散的噪声成分中，利用噪声的全频段特性避免被防御措施轻易过滤。

Result: 实验表明，AGD在攻击性能和对抗防御鲁棒性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: AGD通过在全频段噪声中嵌入对抗信号，显著提升了对抗攻击的鲁棒性和有效性。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of generating adversarial image using a
diffusion model to deceive multimodal large language models (MLLMs) into
generating the targeted responses, while avoiding significant distortion of the
clean image. To address the above challenges, we propose an adversarial-guided
diffusion (AGD) approach for adversarial attack MLLMs. We introduce
adversarial-guided noise to ensure attack efficacy. A key observation in our
design is that, unlike most traditional adversarial attacks which embed
high-frequency perturbations directly into the clean image, AGD injects target
semantics into the noise component of the reverse diffusion. Since the added
noise in a diffusion model spans the entire frequency spectrum, the adversarial
signal embedded within it also inherits this full-spectrum property.
Importantly, during reverse diffusion, the adversarial image is formed as a
linear combination of the clean image and the noise. Thus, when applying
defenses such as a simple low-pass filtering, which act independently on each
component, the adversarial image within the noise component is less likely to
be suppressed, as it is not confined to the high-frequency band. This makes AGD
inherently robust to variety defenses. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our AGD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in attack performance as well as
in model robustness to some defenses.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合分类和分割的监督学习方法，用于改进食品晶体团聚现象的检测和预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 食品晶体团聚现象影响产品质量，但手动标注困难，需自动化解决方案。

Method: 提出基线模型生成分割伪标签，训练实例分类模型，结合分类和分割优势，并加入后处理模块。

Result: 提高了团聚分类准确性和尺寸分布预测，成功分类潜在团聚实例。

Conclusion: 该方法在手动标注置信度不同的情况下表现良好，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Food crystal agglomeration is a phenomenon occurs during crystallization
which traps water between crystals and affects food product quality. Manual
annotation of agglomeration in 2D microscopic images is particularly difficult
due to the transparency of water bonding and the limited perspective focusing
on a single slide of the imaged sample. To address this challenge, we first
propose a supervised baseline model to generate segmentation pseudo-labels for
the coarsely labeled classification dataset. Next, an instance classification
model that simultaneously performs pixel-wise segmentation is trained. Both
models are used in the inference stage to combine their respective strengths in
classification and segmentation. To preserve crystal properties, a post
processing module is designed and included to both steps. Our method improves
true positive agglomeration classification accuracy and size distribution
predictions compared to other existing methods. Given the variability in
confidence levels of manual annotations, our proposed method is evaluated under
two confidence levels and successfully classifies potential agglomerated
instances.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习模型在多尺度特征提取和小目标检测方面表现不足，且计算复杂度高，难以满足实时检测需求。

Method: 设计了双向多尺度空间金字塔池化模块（BMS-SPPF）以增强多尺度特征提取，并采用分层通道压缩策略降低计算复杂度。

Result: 在RDD2022_China_Drone数据集上，mAP50达到67.6%，较基线模型提升2.11%，小目标检测性能提升16.8%，模型大小仅2.0 MB。

Conclusion: YOLO-ROC在道路损伤检测中表现出高效性和高精度，适用于实时应用。

Abstract: Road damage detection is a critical task for ensuring traffic safety and
maintaining infrastructure integrity. While deep learning-based detection
methods are now widely adopted, they still face two core challenges: first, the
inadequate multi-scale feature extraction capabilities of existing networks for
diverse targets like cracks and potholes, leading to high miss rates for
small-scale damage; and second, the substantial parameter counts and
computational demands of mainstream models, which hinder their deployment for
efficient, real-time detection in practical applications. To address these
issues, this paper proposes a high-precision and lightweight model, YOLO - Road
Orthogonal Compact (YOLO-ROC). We designed a Bidirectional Multi-scale Spatial
Pyramid Pooling Fast (BMS-SPPF) module to enhance multi-scale feature
extraction and implemented a hierarchical channel compression strategy to
reduce computational complexity. The BMS-SPPF module leverages a bidirectional
spatial-channel attention mechanism to improve the detection of small targets.
Concurrently, the channel compression strategy reduces the parameter count from
3.01M to 0.89M and GFLOPs from 8.1 to 2.6. Experiments on the
RDD2022_China_Drone dataset demonstrate that YOLO-ROC achieves a mAP50 of
67.6%, surpassing the baseline YOLOv8n by 2.11%. Notably, the mAP50 for the
small-target D40 category improved by 16.8%, and the final model size is only
2.0 MB. Furthermore, the model exhibits excellent generalization performance on
the RDD2022_China_Motorbike dataset.

Conclusion: 研究目标是建立可扩展且人性化的AR安全框架，并寻求在感知建模、多模态内容实现和轻量化模型适配方面的反馈。

Abstract: As augmented reality (AR) becomes increasingly integrated into everyday life,
ensuring the safety and trustworthiness of its virtual content is critical. Our
research addresses the risks of task-detrimental AR content, particularly that
which obstructs critical information or subtly manipulates user perception. We
developed two systems, ViDDAR and VIM-Sense, to detect such attacks using
vision-language models (VLMs) and multimodal reasoning modules. Building on
this foundation, we propose three future directions: automated, perceptually
aligned quality assessment of virtual content; detection of multimodal attacks;
and adaptation of VLMs for efficient and user-centered deployment on AR
devices. Overall, our work aims to establish a scalable, human-aligned
framework for safeguarding AR experiences and seeks feedback on perceptual
modeling, multimodal AR content implementation, and lightweight model
adaptation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种广义半监督少样本类增量学习（GSemi-FSCIL）框架，并设计了ALDC策略以解决现有方法在区分基类和新类无标签样本时的困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有半监督少样本类增量学习方法仅假设无标签数据来自当前会话的新类，与实际场景不符。

Method: 提出ALDC策略，动态利用基类样本校正新类特征分布的偏差。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上实验表明，ALDC优于现有方法，达到新SOTA。

Conclusion: GSemi-FSCIL更贴近实际场景，ALDC策略有效解决了无标签样本的分布偏差问题。

Abstract: Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) focuses on models learning new
concepts from limited data while retaining knowledge of previous classes.
Recently, many studies have started to leverage unlabeled samples to assist
models in learning from few-shot samples, giving rise to the field of
Semi-supervised Few-shot Class-Incremental Learning (Semi-FSCIL). However,
these studies often assume that the source of unlabeled data is only confined
to novel classes of the current session, which presents a narrow perspective
and cannot align well with practical scenarios. To better reflect real-world
scenarios, we redefine Semi-FSCIL as Generalized Semi-FSCIL (GSemi-FSCIL) by
incorporating both base and all the ever-seen novel classes in the unlabeled
set. This change in the composition of unlabeled samples poses a new challenge
for existing methods, as they struggle to distinguish between unlabeled samples
from base and novel classes. To address this issue, we propose an
Ambiguity-guided Learnable Distribution Calibration (ALDC) strategy. ALDC
dynamically uses abundant base samples to correct biased feature distributions
for few-shot novel classes. Experiments on three benchmark datasets show that
our method outperforms existing works, setting new state-of-the-art results.

Method: 采用强化学习框架（GRPO），通过合成场景-问题对训练特定于检索器的查询重写器。

Result: 在多模态RAG中NDCG@3提升11%，在词法检索器中提升9%，但在语义和混合检索器中未显着改进。

Conclusion: RL-QR为RAG系统提供了一种可扩展、无需标注的查询优化方案，但需进一步改进语义检索性能。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems rely heavily on effective query
formulation to unlock external knowledge, yet optimizing queries for diverse,
unstructured real-world documents remains a challenge. We introduce
\textbf{RL-QR}, a reinforcement learning framework for retriever-specific query
rewriting that eliminates the need for human-annotated datasets and extends
applicability to both text-only and multi-modal databases. By synthesizing
scenario-question pairs and leveraging Generalized Reward Policy Optimization
(GRPO), RL-QR trains query rewriters tailored to specific retrievers, enhancing
retrieval performance across varied domains. Experiments on industrial in-house
data demonstrate significant improvements, with
$\text{RL-QR}_{\text{multi-modal}}$ achieving an 11\% relative gain in NDCG@3
for multi-modal RAG and $\text{RL-QR}_{\text{lexical}}$ yielding a 9\% gain for
lexical retrievers. However, challenges persist with semantic and hybrid
retrievers, where rewriters failed to improve performance, likely due to
training misalignments. Our findings highlight RL-QR's potential to
revolutionize query optimization for RAG systems, offering a scalable,
annotation-free solution for real-world retrieval tasks, while identifying
avenues for further refinement in semantic retrieval contexts.

Conclusion: 该研究为扩散成像领域提供了高效的颅神经通路自动化映射工具，有助于复杂脑结构的分析和理解。

Abstract: Cranial nerves (CNs) play a crucial role in various essential functions of
the human brain, and mapping their pathways from diffusion MRI (dMRI) provides
valuable preoperative insights into the spatial relationships between
individual CNs and key tissues. However, mapping a comprehensive and detailed
CN atlas is challenging because of the unique anatomical structures of each CN
pair and the complexity of the skull base environment.In this work, we present
what we believe to be the first study to develop a comprehensive diffusion
tractography atlas for automated mapping of CN pathways in the human brain. The
CN atlas is generated by fiber clustering by using the streamlines generated by
multi-parametric fiber tractography for each pair of CNs. Instead of disposable
clustering, we explore a new strategy of multi-stage fiber clustering for
multiple analysis of approximately 1,000,000 streamlines generated from the 50
subjects from the Human Connectome Project (HCP). Quantitative and visual
experiments demonstrate that our CN atlas achieves high spatial correspondence
with expert manual annotations on multiple acquisition sites, including the HCP
dataset, the Multi-shell Diffusion MRI (MDM) dataset and two clinical cases of
pituitary adenoma patients. The proposed CN atlas can automatically identify 8
fiber bundles associated with 5 pairs of CNs, including the optic nerve CN II,
oculomotor nerve CN III, trigeminal nerve CN V and facial-vestibulocochlear
nerve CN VII/VIII, and its robustness is demonstrated experimentally. This work
contributes to the field of diffusion imaging by facilitating more efficient
and automated mapping the pathways of multiple pairs of CNs, thereby enhancing
the analysis and understanding of complex brain structures through
visualization of their spatial relationships with nearby anatomy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于频繁的遮挡和姿态变化，传统方法难以准确估计草莓质量，需要一种更鲁棒的解决方案。

Method: 采用YOLOv8-Seg进行实例分割，CycleGAN完成遮挡区域修复，倾斜角度校正优化投影面积计算，多项式回归模型将几何特征映射到质量。

Result: 实验显示，孤立草莓的平均质量估计误差为8.11%，遮挡情况下为10.47%。CycleGAN在遮挡修复上优于LaMa模型。

Conclusion: 该方法为复杂遮挡场景下的自动化收获和产量监测提供了鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate mass estimation of table-top grown strawberries under field
conditions remains challenging due to frequent occlusions and pose variations.
This study proposes a vision-based pipeline integrating RGB-D sensing and deep
learning to enable non-destructive, real-time and online mass estimation. The
method employed YOLOv8-Seg for instance segmentation, Cycle-consistent
generative adversarial network (CycleGAN) for occluded region completion, and
tilt-angle correction to refine frontal projection area calculations. A
polynomial regression model then mapped the geometric features to mass.
Experiments demonstrated mean mass estimation errors of 8.11% for isolated
strawberries and 10.47% for occluded cases. CycleGAN outperformed large mask
inpainting (LaMa) model in occlusion recovery, achieving superior pixel area
ratios (PAR) (mean: 0.978 vs. 1.112) and higher intersection over union (IoU)
scores (92.3% vs. 47.7% in the [0.9-1] range). This approach addresses critical
limitations of traditional methods, offering a robust solution for automated
harvesting and yield monitoring with complex occlusion patterns.

Abstract: Generic object tracking remains an important yet challenging task in computer
vision due to complex spatio-temporal dynamics, especially in the presence of
occlusions, similar distractors, and appearance variations. Over the past two
decades, a wide range of tracking paradigms, including Siamese-based trackers,
discriminative trackers, and, more recently, prominent transformer-based
approaches, have been introduced to address these challenges. While a few
existing survey papers in this field have either concentrated on a single
category or widely covered multiple ones to capture progress, our paper
presents a comprehensive review of all three categories, with particular
emphasis on the rapidly evolving transformer-based methods. We analyze the core
design principles, innovations, and limitations of each approach through both
qualitative and quantitative comparisons. Our study introduces a novel
categorization and offers a unified visual and tabular comparison of
representative methods. Additionally, we organize existing trackers from
multiple perspectives and summarize the major evaluation benchmarks,
highlighting the fast-paced advancements in transformer-based tracking driven
by their robust spatio-temporal modeling capabilities.

Conclusion: RAGNet和AffordanceNet为开放世界抓取任务提供了有效的数据和方法支持。

Abstract: General robotic grasping systems require accurate object affordance
perception in diverse open-world scenarios following human instructions.
However, current studies suffer from the problem of lacking reasoning-based
large-scale affordance prediction data, leading to considerable concern about
open-world effectiveness. To address this limitation, we build a large-scale
grasping-oriented affordance segmentation benchmark with human-like
instructions, named RAGNet. It contains 273k images, 180 categories, and 26k
reasoning instructions. The images cover diverse embodied data domains, such as
wild, robot, ego-centric, and even simulation data. They are carefully
annotated with an affordance map, while the difficulty of language instructions
is largely increased by removing their category name and only providing
functional descriptions. Furthermore, we propose a comprehensive
affordance-based grasping framework, named AffordanceNet, which consists of a
VLM pre-trained on our massive affordance data and a grasping network that
conditions an affordance map to grasp the target. Extensive experiments on
affordance segmentation benchmarks and real-robot manipulation tasks show that
our model has a powerful open-world generalization ability. Our data and code

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的时间序列评估指标TGSI和训练损失函数SATL，以更好地捕捉时间序列的几何结构，提升预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数值指标（如MSE）无法评估时间序列的几何结构，而几何结构对理解时间动态至关重要。

Method: 提出TGSI将时间序列转化为图像以评估几何结构；引入SATL损失函数，结合一阶差分损失、频域损失和感知特征损失。

Result: 实验表明，使用SATL训练的模型在MSE和TGSI指标上均优于基线方法，且推理时无额外计算成本。

Conclusion: SATL和TGSI为时间序列预测提供了更全面的评估和训练方法，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Time Series forecasting is critical in diverse domains such as weather
forecasting, financial investment, and traffic management. While traditional
numerical metrics like mean squared error (MSE) can quantify point-wise
accuracy, they fail to evaluate the geometric structure of time series data,
which is essential to understand temporal dynamics. To address this issue, we
propose the time series Geometric Structure Index (TGSI), a novel evaluation
metric that transforms time series into images to leverage their inherent
two-dimensional geometric representations. However, since the image
transformation process is non-differentiable, TGSI cannot be directly
integrated as a training loss. We further introduce the Shape-Aware Temporal
Loss (SATL), a multi-component loss function operating in the time series
modality to bridge this gap and enhance structure modeling during training.
SATL combines three components: a first-order difference loss that measures
structural consistency through the MSE between first-order differences, a
frequency domain loss that captures essential periodic patterns using the Fast
Fourier Transform while minimizing noise, and a perceptual feature loss that
measures geometric structure difference in time-series by aligning temporal
features with geometric structure features through a pre-trained temporal
feature extractor and time-series image autoencoder. Experiments across
multiple datasets demonstrate that models trained with SATL achieve superior
performance in both MSE and the proposed TGSI metrics compared to baseline
methods, without additional computational cost during inference.

Motivation: 传统方法在生成伪标签时忽略了类别间的分数分布差异，导致伪标签不准确，影响模型性能。

Method: 提出SATL算法，动态计算每个类别的正负样本分数分布，并基于此学习类别特定阈值；同时引入差分排序损失以增强阈值区分度。

Result: 在Microsoft COCO和VG-200等大规模多标签数据集上的实验表明，该方法在标签有限的情况下显著提升了性能。

Conclusion: SATL算法通过动态阈值学习和差分排序损失，有效解决了部分标签场景下的伪标签不准确问题，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Multi-label image recognition with partial labels (MLR-PL) is designed to
train models using a mix of known and unknown labels. Traditional methods rely
on semantic or feature correlations to create pseudo-labels for unidentified
labels using pre-set thresholds. This approach often overlooks the varying
score distributions across categories, resulting in inaccurate and incomplete
pseudo-labels, thereby affecting performance. In our study, we introduce the
Semantic-Aware Threshold Learning (SATL) algorithm. This innovative approach
calculates the score distribution for both positive and negative samples within
each category and determines category-specific thresholds based on these
distributions. These distributions and thresholds are dynamically updated
throughout the learning process. Additionally, we implement a differential
ranking loss to establish a significant gap between the score distributions of
positive and negative samples, enhancing the discrimination of the thresholds.
Comprehensive experiments and analysis on large-scale multi-label datasets,
such as Microsoft COCO and VG-200, demonstrate that our method significantly
improves performance in scenarios with limited labels.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前扩散变换器的成功依赖于预训练VAE压缩的潜在空间，但两阶段训练会引入累积误差和解码伪影。现有解决方案转向像素空间，但增加了复杂性和计算成本。

Method: 提出PixelNerd框架，利用神经场直接建模补丁解码，实现单尺度、单阶段的端到端训练，无需复杂级联或VAE。

Result: 在ImageNet 256×256和512×512上分别达到2.15和2.84的FID分数，并在文本到图像任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: PixelNerd提供了一种高效且性能优异的替代方案，避免了传统方法的复杂性。

Abstract: The current success of diffusion transformers heavily depends on the
compressed latent space shaped by the pre-trained variational autoencoder(VAE).
However, this two-stage training paradigm inevitably introduces accumulated
errors and decoding artifacts. To address the aforementioned problems,
researchers return to pixel space at the cost of complicated cascade pipelines
and increased token complexity. In contrast to their efforts, we propose to
model the patch-wise decoding with neural field and present a single-scale,
single-stage, efficient, end-to-end solution, coined as pixel neural field
diffusion~(PixelNerd). Thanks to the efficient neural field representation in
PixNerd, we directly achieved 2.15 FID on ImageNet $256\times256$ and 2.84 FID
on ImageNet $512\times512$ without any complex cascade pipeline or VAE. We also
extend our PixNerd framework to text-to-image applications. Our PixNerd-XXL/16
achieved a competitive 0.73 overall score on the GenEval benchmark and 80.9
overall score on the DPG benchmark.

Conclusion: SAM2等通用基础模型可支持3D医学图像分析，为资源有限地区提供可行方案。

Abstract: Breast MRI provides high-resolution volumetric imaging critical for tumor
assessment and treatment planning, yet manual interpretation of 3D scans
remains labor-intensive and subjective. While AI-powered tools hold promise for
accelerating medical image analysis, adoption of commercial medical AI products
remains limited in low- and middle-income countries due to high license costs,
proprietary software, and infrastructure demands. In this work, we investigate
whether the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) can be adapted for low-cost,
minimal-input 3D tumor segmentation in breast MRI. Using a single bounding box
annotation on one slice, we propagate segmentation predictions across the 3D
volume using three different slice-wise tracking strategies: top-to-bottom,
bottom-to-top, and center-outward. We evaluate these strategies across a large
cohort of patients and find that center-outward propagation yields the most
consistent and accurate segmentations. Despite being a zero-shot model not
trained for volumetric medical data, SAM2 achieves strong segmentation
performance under minimal supervision. We further analyze how segmentation
performance relates to tumor size, location, and shape, identifying key failure
modes. Our results suggest that general-purpose foundation models such as SAM2
can support 3D medical image analysis with minimal supervision, offering an
accessible and affordable alternative for resource-constrained settings.

*Gyeongjin Kang,Seungtae Nam,Xiangyu Sun,Sameh Khamis,Abdelrahman Mohamed,Eunbyung Park*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: iLRM是一种迭代式大型3D重建模型，通过解耦场景表示、分解多视图交互和注入高分辨率信息，实现了高效且高质量的3D重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于Transformer的方法因计算成本高而难以扩展，iLRM旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 采用迭代细化机制，结合解耦表示、两阶段注意力方案和高分辨率信息注入。

Result: 在RE10K和DL3DV数据集上，iLRM在重建质量和速度上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: iLRM通过高效利用多视图输入，显著提升了3D重建的扩展性和质量。

Abstract: Feed-forward 3D modeling has emerged as a promising approach for rapid and
high-quality 3D reconstruction. In particular, directly generating explicit 3D
representations, such as 3D Gaussian splatting, has attracted significant
attention due to its fast and high-quality rendering, as well as numerous
applications. However, many state-of-the-art methods, primarily based on
transformer architectures, suffer from severe scalability issues because they
rely on full attention across image tokens from multiple input views, resulting
in prohibitive computational costs as the number of views or image resolution
increases. Toward a scalable and efficient feed-forward 3D reconstruction, we
introduce an iterative Large 3D Reconstruction Model (iLRM) that generates 3D
Gaussian representations through an iterative refinement mechanism, guided by
three core principles: (1) decoupling the scene representation from input-view
images to enable compact 3D representations; (2) decomposing fully-attentional
multi-view interactions into a two-stage attention scheme to reduce
computational costs; and (3) injecting high-resolution information at every
layer to achieve high-fidelity reconstruction. Experimental results on widely
used datasets, such as RE10K and DL3DV, demonstrate that iLRM outperforms
existing methods in both reconstruction quality and speed. Notably, iLRM
exhibits superior scalability, delivering significantly higher reconstruction
quality under comparable computational cost by efficiently leveraging a larger
number of input views.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniLIP扩展了CLIP的功能，支持重建、生成和编辑任务，通过两阶段训练和自蒸馏策略保持原有理解能力，同时在生成和编辑任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CLIP统一方法需要额外解码器或量化，导致重建不一致或性能下降，UniLIP旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 采用两阶段训练、自蒸馏策略和双条件架构，结合MLLM和扩散变换器。

Result: 在生成任务中，UniLIP在GenEval和WISE基准上分别得分为0.87和0.53；在编辑任务中得分为3.62，超越现有模型。

Conclusion: UniLIP成功扩展了CLIP的应用范围，在理解和生成任务中均表现出色。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose UniLIP, which extends CLIP to reconstruction,
generation and editing, thereby building a unified tokenizer upon its
exceptional comprehension capabilities. Previous CLIP-based unified methods
often require additional diffusion decoders or quantization to support
reconstruction and generation tasks, leading to inconsistent reconstruction or
degradation of original comprehension performance.In contrast, we introduce a
two-stage training scheme and a self-distillation strategy that progressively
integrates reconstruction capabilities into CLIP, allowing it to maintain
original comprehension performance while achieving effective image
reconstruction. Furthermore, we propose a dual-condition architecture to
connect the MLLM and diffusion transformer, using both learnable queries and
the last layer multimodal hidden states as joint conditions. This method not
only enables the utilization of the MLLM's strong reasoning capabilities in
generation tasks, but also maximizes the exploitation of the rich information
in UniLIP features during editing tasks. In text-to-image generation tasks,
UniLIP obtains scores of 0.87 and 0.53 on GenEval and WISE benchmark
respectively, surpassing all previous unified models of similar scale. In image
editing, UniLIP also achieves a score of 3.62 on the ImgEdit Benchmark,
surpassing recent state-of-the-art models such as BAGEL and UniWorld-V1. UniLIP
effectively expand the application scope of CLIP, enabling continuous CLIP
features to not only serve as the optimal choice for understanding tasks but
also achieve highly competitive performance in generation and editing tasks.

TL;DR: 提出BLiM框架和CPN模块，通过双向似然估计和候选先验归一化解决多模态检索中的候选先验偏差问题，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法基于候选似然的多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）检索存在候选先验偏差，偏向高先验而非相关候选。

Method: 提出BLiM框架，结合查询和候选似然的双向估计，并引入训练无关的CPN模块校准分数。

Result: 在四个文本-视频检索基准上，BLiM+CPN平均提升6.4 R@1，有效缓解偏差并增强相关性。

Conclusion: BLiM和CPN在多模态任务中具有广泛适用性，减少对文本先验的依赖，提升视觉理解。

Abstract: Text-Video Retrieval aims to find the most relevant text (or video) candidate
given a video (or text) query from large-scale online databases. Recent work
leverages multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) to improve retrieval,
especially for long or complex query-candidate pairs. However, we observe that
the naive application of MLLMs, i.e., retrieval based on candidate likelihood,
introduces candidate prior bias, favoring candidates with inherently higher
priors over those more relevant to the query. To this end, we propose a novel
retrieval framework, Bidirectional Likelihood Estimation with MLLM (BLiM),
which leverages both query and candidate likelihoods by training the model to
generate text from a given video as well as video features from a given text.
Furthermore, we introduce Candidate Prior Normalization (CPN), a simple yet
effective training-free score calibration module designed to mitigate candidate
prior bias in candidate likelihood. On four Text-Video Retrieval benchmarks,
our BLiM equipped with CPN outperforms previous state-of-the-art models by 6.4
R@1 on average, effectively alleviating candidate prior bias and emphasizing
query-candidate relevance. Our in-depth analysis across various multi-modal
tasks beyond retrieval highlights the broad applicability of CPN which enhances
visual understanding by reducing reliance on textual priors. Code is available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管文档布局分析在大型语言模型和多模态模型的支持下取得进展，但仍存在区域合并、分割和内容缺失等结构错误问题，传统评估指标（如IoU和mAP）无法有效检测这些错误。

Method: 提出LED基准，定义八种标准化错误类型，并设计三项任务：错误存在检测、错误类型分类和元素级错误类型分类。构建合成数据集LED-Dataset，通过注入基于经验分布的结构错误生成。

Result: 实验结果表明，LED能有效区分不同模型的结构理解能力，揭示传统指标无法发现的模态偏差和性能权衡。

Conclusion: LED为文档布局分析提供了一种更全面的评估方法，有助于改进模型的结构鲁棒性。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Document Layout Analysis through Large Language Models
and Multimodal Models have significantly improved layout detection. However,
despite these improvements, challenges remain in addressing critical structural
errors, such as region merging, splitting, and missing content. Conventional
evaluation metrics like IoU and mAP, which focus primarily on spatial overlap,
are insufficient for detecting these errors. To address this limitation, we
propose Layout Error Detection (LED), a novel benchmark designed to evaluate
the structural robustness of document layout predictions. LED defines eight
standardized error types, and formulates three complementary tasks: error
existence detection, error type classification, and element-wise error type
classification. Furthermore, we construct LED-Dataset, a synthetic dataset
generated by injecting realistic structural errors based on empirical
distributions from DLA models. Experimental results across a range of LMMs
reveal that LED effectively differentiates structural understanding
capabilities, exposing modality biases and performance trade-offs not visible
through traditional metrics.

Motivation: 解决现有扩散编辑方法在处理大或复杂变换时的困难，提升几何图像编辑的效果。

Method: 采用解耦流程，分别处理对象变换、源区域修复和目标区域细化，使用FreeFine方法实现后两步。

Result: 在GeoBench基准测试中，FreeFine在图像保真度和编辑精度上优于现有方法，尤其在复杂变换下表现突出。

Conclusion: 提出的解耦流程和FreeFine方法有效提升了几何图像编辑的质量和灵活性。

Abstract: We tackle the task of geometric image editing, where an object within an
image is repositioned, reoriented, or reshaped while preserving overall scene
coherence. Previous diffusion-based editing methods often attempt to handle all
relevant subtasks in a single step, proving difficult when transformations
become large or structurally complex. We address this by proposing a decoupled
pipeline that separates object transformation, source region inpainting, and
target region refinement. Both inpainting and refinement are implemented using
a training-free diffusion approach, FreeFine. In experiments on our new
GeoBench benchmark, which contains both 2D and 3D editing scenarios, FreeFine
outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives in image fidelity, and edit
precision, especially under demanding transformations. Code and benchmark are

TL;DR: ST-SAM提出了一种高效且简洁的半监督伪装目标检测框架，通过动态筛选高置信度伪标签和利用Segment Anything模型，显著减少标注需求并提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于师生框架的半监督伪装目标检测方法存在预测偏差和计算开销大的问题，ST-SAM旨在解决这些限制。

Method: 采用自训练策略动态扩展高置信度伪标签，结合Segment Anything模型的领域知识提示，避免预测偏差。

Result: 在仅1%标注数据下，ST-SAM性能优于现有方法，甚至媲美全监督方法，且仅需训练单一网络。

Conclusion: ST-SAM为高效标注的半监督伪装目标检测提供了新范式。

Abstract: Semi-supervised Camouflaged Object Detection (SSCOD) aims to reduce reliance
on costly pixel-level annotations by leveraging limited annotated data and
abundant unlabeled data. However, existing SSCOD methods based on
Teacher-Student frameworks suffer from severe prediction bias and error
propagation under scarce supervision, while their multi-network architectures
incur high computational overhead and limited scalability. To overcome these
limitations, we propose ST-SAM, a highly annotation-efficient yet concise
framework that breaks away from conventional SSCOD constraints. Specifically,
ST-SAM employs Self-Training strategy that dynamically filters and expands
high-confidence pseudo-labels to enhance a single-model architecture, thereby
fundamentally circumventing inter-model prediction bias. Furthermore, by
transforming pseudo-labels into hybrid prompts containing domain-specific
knowledge, ST-SAM effectively harnesses the Segment Anything Model's potential
for specialized tasks to mitigate error accumulation in self-training.
Experiments on COD benchmark datasets demonstrate that ST-SAM achieves
state-of-the-art performance with only 1\% labeled data, outperforming existing
SSCOD methods and even matching fully supervised methods. Remarkably, ST-SAM
requires training only a single network, without relying on specific models or
loss functions. This work establishes a new paradigm for annotation-efficient
SSCOD. Codes will be available at https://github.com/hu-xh/ST-SAM.

Method: 结合实例感知注意力机制、数据驱动的形状模板空间和扩散框架，生成参考先验以优化预测。

Result: 在大规模数据集上验证，显著提升感知准确性，尤其在挑战性条件下表现优异。

Conclusion: PriorFusion框架能生成更准确、规则且连贯的道路元素预测，为自动驾驶提供可靠支持。

Abstract: With the growing interest in autonomous driving, there is an increasing
demand for accurate and reliable road perception technologies. In complex
environments without high-definition map support, autonomous vehicles must
independently interpret their surroundings to ensure safe and robust
decision-making. However, these scenarios pose significant challenges due to
the large number, complex geometries, and frequent occlusions of road elements.
A key limitation of existing approaches lies in their insufficient exploitation
of the structured priors inherently present in road elements, resulting in
irregular, inaccurate predictions. To address this, we propose PriorFusion, a
unified framework that effectively integrates semantic, geometric, and
generative priors to enhance road element perception. We introduce an
instance-aware attention mechanism guided by shape-prior features, then
construct a data-driven shape template space that encodes low-dimensional
representations of road elements, enabling clustering to generate anchor points
as reference priors. We design a diffusion-based framework that leverages these
prior anchors to generate accurate and complete predictions. Experiments on
large-scale autonomous driving datasets demonstrate that our method
significantly improves perception accuracy, particularly under challenging
conditions. Visualization results further confirm that our approach produces
more accurate, regular, and coherent predictions of road elements.

Conclusion: 研究揭示了扩散模型如何无监督地表示复杂艺术概念，并提供了可视化工具和数据集。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
generating artistic content by learning from billions of images, including
popular artworks. However, the fundamental question of how these models
internally represent concepts, such as content and style in paintings, remains
unexplored. Traditional computer vision assumes content and style are
orthogonal, but diffusion models receive no explicit guidance about this
distinction during training. In this work, we investigate how transformer-based
text-to-image diffusion models encode content and style concepts when
generating artworks. We leverage cross-attention heatmaps to attribute pixels
in generated images to specific prompt tokens, enabling us to isolate image
regions influenced by content-describing versus style-describing tokens. Our
findings reveal that diffusion models demonstrate varying degrees of
content-style separation depending on the specific artistic prompt and style
requested. In many cases, content tokens primarily influence object-related
regions while style tokens affect background and texture areas, suggesting an
emergent understanding of the content-style distinction. These insights
contribute to our understanding of how large-scale generative models internally
represent complex artistic concepts without explicit supervision. We share the
code and dataset, together with an exploratory tool for visualizing attention
maps at https://github.com/umilISLab/artistic-prompt-interpretation.

Abstract: Lightweight convolutional and transformer-based models have become vital for
real-time image classification in resource-constrained applications, such as
embedded systems and edge devices. This work analyzes the influence of
hyperparameter adjustment on the accuracy and convergence behavior of seven
efficient deep learning architectures: EfficientNetV2-S, ConvNeXt-T, MobileViT
v2 (XXS/XS/S), MobileNetV3-L, TinyViT-21M, and RepVGG-A2. All models are
trained on the ImageNet-1K dataset under consistent training settings, with an
emphasis on real-time practicality. An comprehensive ablation study is
undertaken to separate the effect of critical hyperparameters, including
learning rate schedules, batch sizes, input resolution, data augmentation,
regularization approaches, and optimizer choice. To assess appropriateness for
real-time applications, each model is assessed not only in terms of Top-1 and
Top-5 classification accuracy, but also in terms of inference time, parameter
count, model size, and frames-per-second (FPS) on a GPU-accelerated edge
deployment simulation. Results demonstrate that cosine learning rate decay and
adjustable batch size may greatly boost both accuracy and convergence speed,
while keeping low latency and memory cost. Notably, RepVGG-A2 achieves over 80%
Top-1 accuracy with efficient inference performance, offering a compelling
balance between accuracy and deployment cost for VGG-style models. The results
give practical guidance for constructing resource-efficient deep learning
models appropriate for real-time image processing pipelines. All code and

Result: 在nuScenes闭环规划基准测试中，不同修剪比例下均取得最优结果。

Conclusion: FastDriveVLA通过保留前景信息，显著提升了自动驾驶场景中的视觉令牌修剪效果。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated significant potential
in complex scene understanding and action reasoning, leading to their
increasing adoption in end-to-end autonomous driving systems. However, the long
visual tokens of VLA models greatly increase computational costs. Current
visual token pruning methods in Vision-Language Models (VLM) rely on either
visual token similarity or visual-text attention, but both have shown poor
performance in autonomous driving scenarios. Given that human drivers
concentrate on relevant foreground areas while driving, we assert that
retaining visual tokens containing this foreground information is essential for
effective decision-making. Inspired by this, we propose FastDriveVLA, a novel
reconstruction-based vision token pruning framework designed specifically for
autonomous driving. FastDriveVLA includes a plug-and-play visual token pruner
called ReconPruner, which prioritizes foreground information through MAE-style
pixel reconstruction. A novel adversarial foreground-background reconstruction
strategy is designed to train ReconPruner for the visual encoder of VLA models.
Once trained, ReconPruner can be seamlessly applied to different VLA models
with the same visual encoder without retraining. To train ReconPruner, we also
introduce a large-scale dataset called nuScenes-FG, consisting of 241K
image-mask pairs with annotated foreground regions. Our approach achieves
state-of-the-art results on the nuScenes closed-loop planning benchmark across
different pruning ratios.

Conclusion: FASTopoWM通过改进时间感知和减少姿态估计依赖，显著提升了车道拓扑推理性能。

Abstract: Lane segment topology reasoning provides comprehensive bird's-eye view (BEV)
road scene understanding, which can serve as a key perception module in
planning-oriented end-to-end autonomous driving systems. Existing lane topology
reasoning methods often fall short in effectively leveraging temporal
information to enhance detection and reasoning performance. Recently,
stream-based temporal propagation method has demonstrated promising results by
incorporating temporal cues at both the query and BEV levels. However, it
remains limited by over-reliance on historical queries, vulnerability to pose
estimation failures, and insufficient temporal propagation. To overcome these
limitations, we propose FASTopoWM, a novel fast-slow lane segment topology
reasoning framework augmented with latent world models. To reduce the impact of
pose estimation failures, this unified framework enables parallel supervision
of both historical and newly initialized queries, facilitating mutual
reinforcement between the fast and slow systems. Furthermore, we introduce
latent query and BEV world models conditioned on the action latent to propagate
the state representations from past observations to the current timestep. This
design substantially improves the performance of temporal perception within the
slow pipeline. Extensive experiments on the OpenLane-V2 benchmark demonstrate
that FASTopoWM outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both lane segment
detection (37.4% v.s. 33.6% on mAP) and centerline perception (46.3% v.s. 41.5%
on OLS).

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效解决了医学图像分割中的领域偏移问题，提升了模型在实际临床部署中的可靠性。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation plays a crucial role in clinical workflows, but
domain shift often leads to performance degradation when models are applied to
unseen clinical domains. This challenge arises due to variations in imaging
conditions, scanner types, and acquisition protocols, limiting the practical
deployment of segmentation models. Unlike natural images, medical images
typically exhibit consistent anatomical structures across patients, with
domain-specific variations mainly caused by imaging conditions. This unique
characteristic makes medical image segmentation particularly challenging.
  To address this challenge, we propose a domain generalization framework
tailored for medical image segmentation. Our approach improves robustness to
domain-specific variations by introducing implicit feature perturbations guided
by domain statistics. Specifically, we employ a learnable semantic direction
selector and a covariance-based semantic intensity sampler to modulate
domain-variant features while preserving task-relevant anatomical consistency.
Furthermore, we design an adaptive consistency constraint that is selectively
applied only when feature adjustment leads to degraded segmentation
performance. This constraint encourages the adjusted features to align with the
original predictions, thereby stabilizing feature selection and improving the
reliability of the segmentation.
  Extensive experiments on two public multi-center benchmarks show that our
framework consistently outperforms existing domain generalization approaches,
achieving robust and generalizable segmentation performance across diverse
clinical domains.

Abstract: Traffic sign recognition, as a core component of autonomous driving
perception systems, directly influences vehicle environmental awareness and
driving safety. Current technologies face two significant challenges: first,
the traffic sign dataset exhibits a pronounced long-tail distribution,
resulting in a substantial decline in recognition performance of traditional
convolutional networks when processing low-frequency and out-of-distribution
classes; second, traffic signs in real-world scenarios are predominantly small
targets with significant scale variations, making it difficult to extract
multi-scale features.To overcome these issues, we propose a novel two-stage
framework combining open-vocabulary detection and cross-modal learning. For
traffic sign detection, our NanoVerse YOLO model integrates a reparameterizable
vision-language path aggregation network (RepVL-PAN) and an SPD-Conv module to
specifically enhance feature extraction for small, multi-scale targets. For
traffic sign classification, we designed a Traffic Sign Recognition Multimodal
Contrastive Learning model (TSR-MCL). By contrasting visual features from a
Vision Transformer with semantic features from a rule-based BERT, TSR-MCL
learns robust, frequency-independent representations, effectively mitigating
class confusion caused by data imbalance. On the TT100K dataset, our method
achieves a state-of-the-art 78.4% mAP in the long-tail detection task for
all-class recognition. The model also obtains 91.8% accuracy and 88.9% recall,
significantly outperforming mainstream algorithms and demonstrating superior
accuracy and generalization in complex, open-world scenarios.

TL;DR: 提出了一种鲁棒的道路表面重建框架，结合遮挡感知的2D高斯面元与语义引导的颜色增强，以恢复干净、一致的道路表面。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在动态遮挡、视觉杂乱和光照天气变化下表现不佳，需要更鲁棒的解决方案。

Method: 采用平面适应的高斯表示进行大规模建模，结合分割引导的视频修复和语义感知的颜色校正。

Result: 在城市场景数据集上显著优于现有方法，实现了视觉一致和几何精确的重建。

Conclusion: 该框架在复杂现实条件下表现出色，为自动驾驶提供了可靠的道路表面重建。

Abstract: Road surface reconstruction is essential for autonomous driving, supporting
centimeter-accurate lane perception and high-definition mapping in complex
urban environments.While recent methods based on mesh rendering or 3D Gaussian
splatting (3DGS) achieve promising results under clean and static conditions,
they remain vulnerable to occlusions from dynamic agents, visual clutter from
static obstacles, and appearance degradation caused by lighting and weather
changes. We present a robust reconstruction framework that integrates
occlusion-aware 2D Gaussian surfels with semantic-guided color enhancement to
recover clean, consistent road surfaces. Our method leverages a planar-adapted
Gaussian representation for efficient large-scale modeling, employs
segmentation-guided video inpainting to remove both dynamic and static
foreground objects, and enhances color coherence via semantic-aware correction
in HSV space. Extensive experiments on urban-scale datasets demonstrate that
our framework produces visually coherent and geometrically faithful
reconstructions, significantly outperforming prior methods under real-world
conditions.

TL;DR: 研究了输入分辨率对三种深度学习人脸检测器（YOLOv11、YOLOv12、MTCNN）性能的影响，发现YOLOv11在高分辨率下表现最佳，YOLOv12召回率略高，MTCNN在实时性上较差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低分辨率图像在实际应用中影响人脸检测性能，需系统评估不同分辨率下模型的准确性。

Method: 使用WIDER FACE数据集，在不同分辨率（160x160、320x320、640x640）下评估YOLOv11、YOLOv12和MTCNN的性能指标（精度、召回率、mAP50、mAP50-95、推理时间）。

Result: YOLOv11在高分辨率下准确性最高，YOLOv12召回率略优，MTCNN实时性较差。

Conclusion: 研究结果为根据不同操作约束选择分辨率敏感的人脸检测模型提供了实用建议。

Abstract: Face detection is a crucial component in many AI-driven applications such as
surveillance, biometric authentication, and human-computer interaction.
However, real-world conditions like low-resolution imagery present significant
challenges that degrade detection performance. In this study, we systematically
investigate the impact of input resolution on the accuracy and robustness of
three prominent deep learning-based face detectors: YOLOv11, YOLOv12, and
MTCNN. Using the WIDER FACE dataset, we conduct extensive evaluations across
multiple image resolutions (160x160, 320x320, and 640x640) and assess each
model's performance using metrics such as precision, recall, mAP50, mAP50-95,
and inference time. Results indicate that YOLOv11 outperforms YOLOv12 and MTCNN
in terms of detection accuracy, especially at higher resolutions, while YOLOv12
exhibits slightly better recall. MTCNN, although competitive in landmark
localization, lags in real-time inference speed. Our findings provide
actionable insights for selecting resolution-aware face detection models
suitable for varying operational constraints.

Motivation: 当前AGTH的质量问题缺乏全面研究，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 构建THQA-10K数据集，招募志愿者主观评分，并提出基于多特征的客观评估方法。

Result: 提出的客观评估方法在AGTH质量评估中达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: THQA-10K数据集和提出的方法为AGTH质量评估提供了重要工具和基准。

Abstract: Speech-driven methods for portraits are figuratively known as "Talkers"
because of their capability to synthesize speaking mouth shapes and facial
movements. Especially with the rapid development of the Text-to-Image (T2I)
models, AI-Generated Talking Heads (AGTHs) have gradually become an emerging
digital human media. However, challenges persist regarding the quality of these
talkers and AGTHs they generate, and comprehensive studies addressing these
issues remain limited. To address this gap, this paper presents the largest
AGTH quality assessment dataset THQA-10K to date, which selects 12 prominent
T2I models and 14 advanced talkers to generate AGTHs for 14 prompts. After
excluding instances where AGTH generation is unsuccessful, the THQA-10K dataset
contains 10,457 AGTHs. Then, volunteers are recruited to subjectively rate the
AGTHs and give the corresponding distortion categories. In our analysis for
subjective experimental results, we evaluate the performance of talkers in
terms of generalizability and quality, and also expose the distortions of
existing AGTHs. Finally, an objective quality assessment method based on the
first frame, Y-T slice and tone-lip consistency is proposed. Experimental
results show that this method can achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance
in AGTH quality assessment. The work is released at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨计算机视觉领域的关键设计模式如何演变，以推动图像识别、生成和自监督学习的发展。

Method: 分析六篇论文，包括ResNet、ViT、GANs、LDMs、DINO和MAE，总结其核心贡献和方法。

Result: ResNet解决了梯度消失问题，ViT引入注意力机制，GANs和LDMs提升了生成模型性能，DINO和MAE推动了自监督学习。

Conclusion: 计算机视觉设计模式不断演进，从深度网络到注意力机制和自监督学习，推动了领域的高效发展。

Abstract: This report analyzes the evolution of key design patterns in computer vision
by examining six influential papers. The analy- sis begins with foundational
architectures for image recognition. We review ResNet, which introduced
residual connections to overcome the vanishing gradient problem and enable
effective training of significantly deeper convolutional networks.
Subsequently, we examine the Vision Transformer (ViT), which established a new
paradigm by applying the Transformer ar- chitecture to sequences of image
patches, demonstrating the efficacy of attention-based models for large-scale
image recogni- tion. Building on these visual representation backbones, we
investigate generative models. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are
analyzed for their novel adversarial training process, which challenges a
generator against a discriminator to learn complex data distributions. Then,
Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) are covered, which improve upon prior generative
methods by performing a sequential denoising process in a perceptually
compressed latent space. LDMs achieve high-fidelity synthesis with greater
computational efficiency, representing the current state-of-the-art for image
generation. Finally, we explore self-supervised learning techniques that reduce
dependency on labeled data. DINO is a self-distillation framework in which a
student network learns to match the output of a momentum-updated teacher,
yielding features with strong k-NN classification performance. We conclude with
Masked Autoencoders (MAE), which utilize an asymmetric encoder-decoder design
to reconstruct heavily masked inputs, providing a highly scalable and effective
method for pre-training large-scale vision models.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Short-LVLM（SVL）的新框架，通过利用重要的视觉语言（VL）标记并减少层间特征差距，解决了直接应用NLP层剪枝方法在大型视觉语言模型（LVLM）中无效的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型视觉语言模型在多模态理解和推理方面表现出色，但其庞大的参数和高计算成本限制了实际应用。NLP中的层剪枝方法虽有效，但由于视觉和语言模态的差异，其在LVLM中的适用性尚不明确。

Method: 论文通过实验发现，非必要的VL标记和层间特征差距是LVLM层剪枝的主要挑战。基于此，提出了Short-LVLM框架，该框架能有效利用重要VL标记并减少层间特征差距。

Result: Short-LVLM在性能和效率之间取得了更好的平衡，同时具备无需训练、模型无关和高度兼容等优势。

Conclusion: Short-LVLM为LVLM的层剪枝提供了一种有效的解决方案，具有实际应用的潜力。

Abstract: Although large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive
capabilities in multi-modal understanding and reasoning, their practical
applications are still limited by massive model parameters and high
computational costs. Recent efforts from natural language processing (NLP) have
shown the effectiveness of layer pruning, offering a plausible training-free
compression solution. However, due to the modality divergence between vision
and language, it is unclear whether these NLP techniques are still effective in
LVLMs. In this paper, we empirically prove that directly applying these layer
pruning methods to LVLMs is ineffective. Through extensive experiments, we find
that non-essential vision-language (VL) tokens and inter-layer feature gaps
pose critical challenges to pruning layers in LVLMs. Based on these insights,
we propose a novel framework Short-LVLM (SVL) that can utilize important VL
tokens and mitigate the layer-wise feature gaps. Notably, Short-LVLM not only
achieves a superior trade-off between performance and efficiency but also
exhibits several potential advantages, i.e., training-free, model-agnostic, and
highly compatible. The code for this work is publicly available at

Conclusion: VMatcher通过混合Mamba和Transformer，在特征匹配任务中实现了高效与高性能的平衡，适用于实时场景。

Abstract: This paper introduces VMatcher, a hybrid Mamba-Transformer network for
semi-dense feature matching between image pairs. Learning-based feature
matching methods, whether detector-based or detector-free, achieve
state-of-the-art performance but depend heavily on the Transformer's attention
mechanism, which, while effective, incurs high computational costs due to its
quadratic complexity. In contrast, Mamba introduces a Selective State-Space
Model (SSM) that achieves comparable or superior performance with linear
complexity, offering significant efficiency gains. VMatcher leverages a hybrid
approach, integrating Mamba's highly efficient long-sequence processing with
the Transformer's attention mechanism. Multiple VMatcher configurations are
proposed, including hierarchical architectures, demonstrating their
effectiveness in setting new benchmarks efficiently while ensuring robustness
and practicality for real-time applications where rapid inference is crucial.

Motivation: 情感理解与生成任务通常被分开处理，但它们具有互补性，可以相互增强。

Result: UniEmo在情感理解和生成任务上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 联合训练和生成驱动的双重反馈机制提升了模型的理解能力。

Abstract: Emotional understanding and generation are often treated as separate tasks,
yet they are inherently complementary and can mutually enhance each other. In
this paper, we propose the UniEmo, a unified framework that seamlessly
integrates these two tasks. The key challenge lies in the abstract nature of
emotions, necessitating the extraction of visual representations beneficial for
both tasks. To address this, we propose a hierarchical emotional understanding
chain with learnable expert queries that progressively extracts multi-scale
emotional features, thereby serving as a foundational step for unification.
Simultaneously, we fuse these expert queries and emotional representations to
guide the diffusion model in generating emotion-evoking images. To enhance the
diversity and fidelity of the generated emotional images, we further introduce
the emotional correlation coefficient and emotional condition loss into the
fusion process. This step facilitates fusion and alignment for emotional
generation guided by the understanding. In turn, we demonstrate that joint
training allows the generation component to provide implicit feedback to the
understanding part. Furthermore, we propose a novel data filtering algorithm to
select high-quality and diverse emotional images generated by the well-trained
model, which explicitly feedback into the understanding part. Together, these
generation-driven dual feedback processes enhance the model's understanding
capacity. Extensive experiments show that UniEmo significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in both emotional understanding and generation tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在无监督域适应中一次性使用所有伪标签数据对齐源域和目标域，容易受到噪声和难分类样本的影响，导致错误传播和次优特征学习。多源场景下问题更严重。

Method: 提出MP^2A方法，首先在高置信度目标样本上训练模型，逐步引入更具挑战性的样本，以减少初始标签噪声的干扰。

Result: 在ImageCLEF、Office-Home和DomainNet三个基准测试中，MP^2A优于现有基于CLIP的多源无监督域适应方法。

Conclusion: 渐进式对齐策略有效减少了噪声影响，提升了模型性能，证明了其在无监督域适应中的有效性。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models like CLIP have become a powerful foundation for
Unsupervised Domain Adaptation due to their strong zero-shot generalization.
State-of-the-art methods typically leverage CLIP to generate pseudo-labels for
the target domain, then fine-tune the model to learn domain-invariant features.
However, these methods attempt to align source and target domains using all
pseudo-labeled data simultaneously. This one-shot alignment struggles with
noisy, hard-to-classify samples, leading to error propagation and suboptimal
feature learning. The problem is even more amplified in the multi-source
scenario, where diverse domain gaps and varying noise levels across multiple
source domains further destabilize the alignment process. To address this
issue, in this work, we propose a progressive alignment strategy for adapting
CLIP to unlabeled downstream task. Our method begins by training the model on a
high-confidence subset of target samples, allowing it to first learn a
well-aligned representation from the most reliable data. As training
progresses, it gradually incorporates more challenging samples, guiding the
model to refine its understanding without being overwhelmed by initial label
noise. This progressive approach effectively mitigates confirmation bias and
promotes a more robust convergence, allowing for the learning of genuinely
domain-invariant features. We name our approach MP^2A and test it on three
popular UDA benchmarks, namely ImageCLEF, Office-Home, and the most challenging
DomainNet. Experiments showcase that MP^2A achieves state-of-the-art
performance when compared with most recent CLIP-based MS-UDA approaches,
demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.

Result: 在基准数据集上，NeRF-GS表现优于现有方法，达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: NeRF和3DGS是互补的，而非竞争关系，为结合两者的高效3D场景表示提供了新思路。

Abstract: We introduce NeRF-GS, a novel framework that jointly optimizes Neural
Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). This framework
leverages the inherent continuous spatial representation of NeRF to mitigate
several limitations of 3DGS, including sensitivity to Gaussian initialization,
limited spatial awareness, and weak inter-Gaussian correlations, thereby
enhancing its performance. In NeRF-GS, we revisit the design of 3DGS and
progressively align its spatial features with NeRF, enabling both
representations to be optimized within the same scene through shared 3D spatial
information. We further address the formal distinctions between the two
approaches by optimizing residual vectors for both implicit features and
Gaussian positions to enhance the personalized capabilities of 3DGS.
Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that NeRF-GS surpasses existing
methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance. This outcome confirms that
NeRF and 3DGS are complementary rather than competing, offering new insights
into hybrid approaches that combine 3DGS and NeRF for efficient 3D scene
representation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前医学领域的视觉语言预训练方法常简化临床报告为单一实体或碎片化标记，且对比学习框架依赖大量负样本，这在小型医学数据集中不实用。

Method: AGA通过双向分组机制和稀疏相似性矩阵，动态学习分组阈值，并引入实例感知分组对齐损失和双向跨模态分组对齐模块。

Result: 在公开和私有数据集上的实验表明，AGA在图像-文本检索和分类任务中表现出色，适用于微调和零样本设置。

Conclusion: AGA有效地解决了医学视觉表示学习中的结构化语义捕获和负样本依赖问题，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Learning medical visual representations from paired images and reports is a
promising direction in representation learning. However, current
vision-language pretraining methods in the medical domain often simplify
clinical reports into single entities or fragmented tokens, ignoring their
inherent structure. In addition, contrastive learning frameworks typically
depend on large quantities of hard negative samples, which is impractical for
small-scale medical datasets. To tackle these challenges, we propose Adaptive
Grouped Alignment (AGA), a new framework that captures structured semantics
from paired medical images and reports. AGA introduces a bidirectional grouping
mechanism based on a sparse similarity matrix. For each image-report pair, we
compute fine-grained similarities between text tokens and image patches. Each
token selects its top-matching patches to form a visual group, and each patch
selects its most related tokens to form a language group. To enable adaptive
grouping, we design two threshold gating modules, called Language Grouped
Threshold Gate and Vision Grouped Threshold Gate, which learn grouping
thresholds dynamically. Group representations are computed as weighted averages
based on similarity scores. To align each token with its group representation,
we introduce an Instance Aware Group Alignment loss that operates within each
image-text pair, removing the need for external negatives. Finally, a
Bidirectional Cross-modal Grouped Alignment module is applied to enhance
fine-grained alignment between visual and linguistic group representations.
Extensive experiments on public and private datasets show that our method
achieves strong performance on image-text retrieval and classification tasks
under both fine-tuning and zero-shot settings.

Motivation: 解决现有生成方法在医学影像中OOD检测时计算成本高、不可靠且需重新训练的局限性。

Method: 利用SBDDM的前向扩散轨迹和Stein分数捕获轨迹曲率，仅需五步扩散即可实现异常评分。

Result: 在Near-OOD和Far-OOD检测中分别提升了10.43%和18.10%，计算成本大幅降低。

Conclusion: SBDDM是一种高效、可靠的OOD检测方法，适用于实时计算机辅助诊断。

Abstract: In medical imaging, unsupervised out-of-distribution (OOD) detection offers
an attractive approach for identifying pathological cases with extremely low
incidence rates. In contrast to supervised methods, OOD-based approaches
function without labels and are inherently robust to data imbalances. Current
generative approaches often rely on likelihood estimation or reconstruction
error, but these methods can be computationally expensive, unreliable, and
require retraining if the inlier data changes. These limitations hinder their
ability to distinguish nominal from anomalous inputs efficiently, consistently,
and robustly. We propose a reconstruction-free OOD detection method that
leverages the forward diffusion trajectories of a Stein score-based denoising
diffusion model (SBDDM). By capturing trajectory curvature via the estimated
Stein score, our approach enables accurate anomaly scoring with only five
diffusion steps. A single SBDDM pre-trained on a large, semantically aligned
medical dataset generalizes effectively across multiple Near-OOD and Far-OOD
benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art performance while drastically reducing
computational cost during inference. Compared to existing methods, SBDDM
achieves a relative improvement of up to 10.43% and 18.10% for Near-OOD and
Far-OOD detection, making it a practical building block for real-time, reliable
computer-aided diagnosis.

Conclusion: 该系统为蜂蜜掺假检测提供了一种高效、准确的替代方案。

Abstract: This paper aims to develop a machine learning-based system for automatically
detecting honey adulteration with sugar syrup, based on honey hyperspectral
imaging data. First, the floral source of a honey sample is classified by a
botanical origin identification subsystem. Then, the sugar syrup adulteration
is identified, and its concentration is quantified by an adulteration detection
subsystem. Both subsystems consist of two steps. The first step involves
extracting relevant features from the honey sample using Linear Discriminant
Analysis (LDA). In the second step, we utilize the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
model to classify the honey botanical origin in the first subsystem and
identify the adulteration level in the second subsystem. We assess the proposed
system performance on a public honey hyperspectral image dataset. The result
indicates that the proposed system can detect adulteration in honey with an
overall cross-validation accuracy of 96.39%, making it an appropriate
alternative to the current chemical-based detection methods.

Motivation: 艺术风格分类因缺乏专家标注数据集和风格元素间复杂的非线性关系而具有挑战性。现有双教师自监督框架的线性投影层和局部聚焦难以建模全局构图和复杂风格特征交互。

Method: 改进双教师知识蒸馏框架，用KANs替代传统MLP投影和预测头，利用其基于样条的激活函数精确建模非线性特征相关性。

Result: 在WikiArt和Pandora18k数据集上的实验表明，该方法在Top-1准确率上优于基础双教师架构，且线性探针准确率更高。

Conclusion: KANs在解耦复杂风格流形中具有重要作用，能显著提升分类性能。

Abstract: Art style classification remains a formidable challenge in computational
aesthetics due to the scarcity of expertly labeled datasets and the intricate,
often nonlinear interplay of stylistic elements. While recent dual-teacher
self-supervised frameworks reduce reliance on labeled data, their linear
projection layers and localized focus struggle to model global compositional
context and complex style-feature interactions. We enhance the dual-teacher
knowledge distillation framework to address these limitations by replacing
conventional MLP projection and prediction heads with Kolmogorov-Arnold
Networks (KANs). Our approach retains complementary guidance from two teacher
networks, one emphasizing localized texture and brushstroke patterns, the other
capturing broader stylistic hierarchies while leveraging KANs' spline-based
activations to model nonlinear feature correlations with mathematical
precision. Experiments on WikiArt and Pandora18k demonstrate that our approach
outperforms the base dual teacher architecture in Top-1 accuracy. Our findings
highlight the importance of KANs in disentangling complex style manifolds,
leading to better linear probe accuracy than MLP projections.

Abstract: With the rapid growth of hyperspectral data archives in remote sensing (RS),
the need for efficient storage has become essential, driving significant
attention toward learning-based hyperspectral image (HSI) compression. However,
a comprehensive investigation of the individual and joint effects of spectral
and spatial compression on learning-based HSI compression has not been
thoroughly examined yet. Conducting such an analysis is crucial for
understanding how the exploitation of spectral, spatial, and joint
spatio-spectral redundancies affects HSI compression. To address this issue, we
propose Adjustable Spatio-Spectral Hyperspectral Image Compression Network
(HyCASS), a learning-based model designed for adjustable HSI compression in
both spectral and spatial dimensions. HyCASS consists of six main modules: 1)
spectral encoder; 2) spatial encoder; 3) compression ratio (CR) adapter
encoder; 4) CR adapter decoder; 5) spatial decoder; and 6) spectral decoder
module. The modules employ convolutional layers and transformer blocks to
capture both short-range and long-range redundancies. Experimental results on
two HSI benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed
adjustable model compared to existing learning-based compression models. Based
on our results, we establish a guideline for effectively balancing spectral and
spatial compression across different CRs, taking into account the spatial
resolution of the HSIs. Our code and pre-trained model weights are publicly
available at https://git.tu-berlin.de/rsim/hycass .

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文探讨了机器学习和人工智能在医学影像分析中的应用，通过两种算法（基线CNN和DenseNet-121）对5824张胸部X光片进行分类，结果显示DenseNet-121表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是利用机器学习解决医学影像中的复杂问题，提高疾病预测的准确性。

Method: 方法包括使用基线CNN和DenseNet-121对胸部X光片进行二元分类，并通过梯度加权类激活映射分析决策过程。

Result: 结果显示两种算法表现良好，但DenseNet-121在决策时更准确地聚焦于关键区域。

Conclusion: 结论是DenseNet-121在医学影像分类中优于基线CNN，具有更高的实用价值。

Abstract: Machine learning and artificial intelligence are fast-growing fields of
research in which data is used to train algorithms, learn patterns, and make
predictions. This approach helps to solve seemingly intricate problems with
significant accuracy without explicit programming by recognizing complex
relationships in data. Taking an example of 5824 chest X-ray images, we
implement two machine learning algorithms, namely, a baseline convolutional
neural network (CNN) and a DenseNet-121, and present our analysis in making
machine-learned predictions in predicting patients with ailments. Both baseline
CNN and DenseNet-121 perform very well in the binary classification problem
presented in this work. Gradient-weighted class activation mapping shows that
DenseNet-121 correctly focuses on essential parts of the input chest X-ray
images in its decision-making more than the baseline CNN.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种解决联邦学习中分辨率漂移问题的方法（RAF），通过热图知识蒸馏提升分辨率鲁棒性，并在人体姿态估计任务中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习在分类任务中已取得成功，但在非分类任务（如人体姿态估计）中的应用仍待探索。分辨率漂移问题导致性能显著下降，需解决。

Method: 提出分辨率自适应联邦学习（RAF），利用热图知识蒸馏，通过多分辨率知识蒸馏（高分辨率输出作为教师，低分辨率输出作为学生）提升鲁棒性。

Result: 实验和理论分析表明，RAF有效缓解分辨率漂移，显著提升性能，并可无缝集成到现有联邦学习框架中。

Conclusion: RAF不仅适用于人体姿态估计，其通用性还支持其他依赖空间细节保留的任务。

Abstract: The Federated Learning (FL) approach enables effective learning across
distributed systems, while preserving user data privacy. To date, research has
primarily focused on addressing statistical heterogeneity and communication
efficiency, through which FL has achieved success in classification tasks.
However, its application to non-classification tasks, such as human pose
estimation, remains underexplored. This paper identifies and investigates a
critical issue termed ``resolution-drift,'' where performance degrades
significantly due to resolution variability across clients. Unlike class-level
heterogeneity, resolution drift highlights the importance of resolution as
another axis of not independent or identically distributed (non-IID) data. To
address this issue, we present resolution-adaptive federated learning (RAF), a
method that leverages heatmap-based knowledge distillation. Through
multi-resolution knowledge distillation between higher-resolution outputs
(teachers) and lower-resolution outputs (students), our approach enhances
resolution robustness without overfitting. Extensive experiments and
theoretical analysis demonstrate that RAF not only effectively mitigates
resolution drift and achieves significant performance improvements, but also
can be integrated seamlessly into existing FL frameworks. Furthermore, although
this paper focuses on human pose estimation, our t-SNE analysis reveals
distinct characteristics between classification and high-resolution
representation tasks, supporting the generalizability of RAF to other tasks
that rely on preserving spatial detail.

TL;DR: CST Anti-UAV是一个新的热红外数据集，专为复杂场景中的小型无人机单目标跟踪设计，填补了现有数据集的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无人机跟踪数据集缺乏多样性和复杂性，限制了其在真实场景中的应用。

Method: 提出CST Anti-UAV数据集，包含220个视频序列和24万高质量标注框，并评估了20种现有SOT方法。

Result: 实验显示，复杂环境中跟踪小型无人机仍具挑战性，最佳方法准确率仅为35.92%。

Conclusion: CST Anti-UAV的发布将推动更鲁棒的SOT方法和反无人机系统的创新。

Abstract: The widespread application of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) has raised
serious public safety and privacy concerns, making UAV perception crucial for
anti-UAV tasks. However, existing UAV tracking datasets predominantly feature
conspicuous objects and lack diversity in scene complexity and attribute
representation, limiting their applicability to real-world scenarios. To
overcome these limitations, we present the CST Anti-UAV, a new thermal infrared
dataset specifically designed for Single Object Tracking (SOT) in Complex
Scenes with Tiny UAVs (CST). It contains 220 video sequences with over 240k
high-quality bounding box annotations, highlighting two key properties: a
significant number of tiny-sized UAV targets and the diverse and complex
scenes. To the best of our knowledge, CST Anti-UAV is the first dataset to
incorporate complete manual frame-level attribute annotations, enabling precise
evaluations under varied challenges. To conduct an in-depth performance
analysis for CST Anti-UAV, we evaluate 20 existing SOT methods on the proposed
dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that tracking tiny UAVs in complex
environments remains a challenge, as the state-of-the-art method achieves only
35.92% state accuracy, much lower than the 67.69% observed on the Anti-UAV410
dataset. These findings underscore the limitations of existing benchmarks and
the need for further advancements in UAV tracking research. The CST Anti-UAV
benchmark is about to be publicly released, which not only fosters the
development of more robust SOT methods but also drives innovation in anti-UAV
systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前3D视觉语言模型在推理和泛化能力上存在不足，主要由于高质量空间数据和静态视角假设的限制。

Method: 构建高质量合成数据集Scene-30K，结合强化学习策略（如GRPO）和动态视角选择策略。

Result: 在多个3D场景基准测试中平均提升10%的性能。

Conclusion: 3D-R1显著提升了3D场景理解中的推理和泛化能力。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) have made significant strides in 2D
visual understanding tasks, sparking interest in extending these capabilities
to 3D scene understanding. However, current 3D VLMs often struggle with robust
reasoning and generalization due to limitations in high-quality spatial data
and the static nature of viewpoint assumptions. To address these challenges, we
propose 3D-R1, a foundation model that enhances the reasoning capabilities of
3D VLMs. Specifically, we first construct a high-quality synthetic dataset with
CoT, named Scene-30K, leveraging existing 3D-VL datasets and a data engine
based on Gemini 2.5 Pro. It serves as cold-start initialization data for 3D-R1.
Moreover, we leverage RLHF policy such as GRPO in the reinforcement learning
training process to enhance reasoning capabilities and introduce three reward
functions: a perception reward, a semantic similarity reward and a format
reward to maintain detection accuracy and answer semantic precision.
Furthermore, we introduce a dynamic view selection strategy that adaptively
chooses the most informative perspectives for 3D scene understanding. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that 3D-R1 delivers an average improvement of 10%
across various 3D scene benchmarks, highlighting its effectiveness in enhancing
reasoning and generalization in 3D scene understanding. Code:

Conclusion: 该方法在AI驱动的胶囊内窥镜领域取得了显著进展，优于现有单任务模型。

Abstract: Video capsule endoscopy has become increasingly important for investigating
the small intestine within the gastrointestinal tract. However, a persistent
challenge remains the short battery lifetime of such compact sensor edge
devices. Integrating artificial intelligence can help overcome this limitation
by enabling intelligent real-time decision- making, thereby reducing the energy
consumption and prolonging the battery life. However, this remains challenging
due to data sparsity and the limited resources of the device restricting the
overall model size. In this work, we introduce a multi-task neural network that
combines the functionalities of precise self-localization within the
gastrointestinal tract with the ability to detect anomalies in the small
intestine within a single model. Throughout the development process, we
consistently restricted the total number of parameters to ensure the
feasibility to deploy such model in a small capsule. We report the first
multi-task results using the recently published Galar dataset, integrating
established multi-task methods and Viterbi decoding for subsequent time-series
analysis. This outperforms current single-task models and represents a
significant ad- vance in AI-based approaches in this field. Our model achieves
an accu- racy of 93.63% on the localization task and an accuracy of 87.48% on
the anomaly detection task. The approach requires only 1 million parameters
while surpassing the current baselines.

curve, we can efficiently identify subsequent sample points without
exhaustively computing all pairwise distances. Our proposal substantially
accelerates farthest point sampling and neighbor search operations while
preserving sampling quality and model performance. By integrating FastPoint
into state-of-the-art 3D point cloud models, we achieve 2.55x end-to-end
speedup on NVIDIA RTX 3090 GPU without sacrificing accuracy.

Conclusion: Stable-Sim2Real为数据驱动的3D模拟提供了新思路，并在实际应用中表现出色。

Abstract: 3D data simulation aims to bridge the gap between simulated and real-captured
3D data, which is a fundamental problem for real-world 3D visual tasks. Most 3D
data simulation methods inject predefined physical priors but struggle to
capture the full complexity of real data. An optimal approach involves learning
an implicit mapping from synthetic to realistic data in a data-driven manner,
but progress in this solution has met stagnation in recent studies. This work
explores a new solution path of data-driven 3D simulation, called
Stable-Sim2Real, based on a novel two-stage depth diffusion model. The initial
stage finetunes Stable-Diffusion to generate the residual between the real and
synthetic paired depth, producing a stable but coarse depth, where some local
regions may deviate from realistic patterns. To enhance this, both the
synthetic and initial output depth are fed into a second-stage diffusion, where
diffusion loss is adjusted to prioritize these distinct areas identified by a
3D discriminator. We provide a new benchmark scheme to evaluate 3D data
simulation methods. Extensive experiments show that training the network with
the 3D simulated data derived from our method significantly enhances
performance in real-world 3D visual tasks. Moreover, the evaluation
demonstrates the high similarity between our 3D simulated data and
real-captured patterns. Project page:

Motivation: 现有基于欧几里得空间的配准方法在多模态图像配准中效果不佳，需要探索非欧几里得空间以解决跨模态配准问题。

Method: 提出Hy-CycleAlign方法，包括双路径循环配准框架和双曲层次对比对齐模块（H²CA），在双曲空间中进行图像配准。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多模态图像配准和融合中显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 双曲空间为多模态图像配准提供了更敏感和有效的解决方案，Hy-CycleAlign具有显著优势。

Abstract: Image fusion synthesizes complementary information from multiple sources,
mitigating the inherent limitations of unimodal imaging systems. Accurate image
registration is essential for effective multi-source data fusion. However,
existing registration methods, often based on image translation in Euclidean
space, fail to handle cross-modal misalignment effectively, resulting in
suboptimal alignment and fusion quality. To overcome this limitation, we
explore image alignment in non-Euclidean space and propose a Hyperbolic Cycle
Alignment Network (Hy-CycleAlign). To the best of our knowledge, Hy-CycleAlign
is the first image registration method based on hyperbolic space. It introduces
a dual-path cross-modal cyclic registration framework, in which a forward
registration network aligns cross-modal inputs, while a backward registration
network reconstructs the original image, forming a closed-loop registration
structure with geometric consistency. Additionally, we design a Hyperbolic
Hierarchy Contrastive Alignment (H$^{2}$CA) module, which maps images into
hyperbolic space and imposes registration constraints, effectively reducing
interference caused by modality discrepancies. We further analyze image
registration in both Euclidean and hyperbolic spaces, demonstrating that
hyperbolic space enables more sensitive and effective multi-modal image
registration. Extensive experiments on misaligned multi-modal images
demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches in
both image alignment and fusion. Our code will be publicly available.

Motivation: 随着图像分类模型的多样化和复杂性增加，理解模型决策过程的需求日益迫切，但目前对模型工作原理的理解有限。

Method: 通过分析最小充分像素集（捕捉图像本质的像素）的位置、重叠和大小，比较不同视觉模型的集中度。

Result: 不同架构模型（如ConvNext和EVA）在集中度上存在显著差异；误分类图像关联的像素集更大。

Conclusion: 最小充分像素集是理解模型决策过程的有效工具，不同架构模型的集中度差异为模型选择提供了新视角。

Abstract: Machine learning for image classification is an active and rapidly developing
field. With the proliferation of classifiers of different sizes and different
architectures, the problem of choosing the right model becomes more and more
important.
  While we can assess a model's classification accuracy statistically, our
understanding of the way these models work is unfortunately limited. In order
to gain insight into the decision-making process of different vision models, we
propose using minimal sufficient pixels sets to gauge a model's
`concentration': the pixels that capture the essence of an image through the
lens of the model. By comparing position, overlap, and size of sets of pixels,
we identify that different architectures have statistically different
concentration, in both size and position. In particular, ConvNext and EVA
models differ markedly from the others. We also identify that images which are
misclassified are associated with larger pixels sets than correct
classifications.

Motivation: 传统VRD模型难以泛化到训练数据之外的关系，而提示调优方法对复杂或新关系效果有限。

Method: ART将VRD数据转换为指令调优格式，并采用自适应采样算法，专注于信息丰富的关系。

Result: ART在多个数据集上显著优于基线方法，并能推断未见过的关系概念。

Conclusion: ART为VRD提供了更有效的解决方案，并展示了在复杂场景分割中的实用价值。

Abstract: Visual relation detection (VRD) is the task of identifying the relationships
between objects in a scene. VRD models trained solely on relation detection
data struggle to generalize beyond the relations on which they are trained.
While prompt tuning has been used to adapt vision-language models (VLMs) for
VRD, it uses handcrafted prompts and struggles with novel or complex relations.
We argue that instruction tuning offers a more effective solution by
fine-tuning VLMs on diverse instructional data. We thus introduce ART, an
Adaptive Relation Tuning framework that adapts VLMs for VRD through instruction
tuning and strategic instance selection. By converting VRD datasets into an
instruction tuning format and employing an adaptive sampling algorithm, ART
directs the VLM to focus on informative relations while maintaining
generalizability. Specifically, we focus on the relation classification, where
subject-object boxes are given and the model predicts the predicate between
them. We tune on a held-in set and evaluate across multiple held-out datasets
of varying complexity. Our approach strongly improves over its baselines and
can infer unseen relation concepts, a capability absent in mainstream VRD
methods. We demonstrate ART's practical value by using the predicted relations
for segmenting complex scenes.

Abstract: Monocular 3D object detection is valuable for various applications such as
robotics and AR/VR. Existing methods are confined to closed-set settings, where
the training and testing sets consist of the same scenes and/or object
categories. However, real-world applications often introduce new environments
and novel object categories, posing a challenge to these methods. In this
paper, we address monocular 3D object detection in an open-set setting and
introduce the first end-to-end 3D Monocular Open-set Object Detector (3D-MOOD).
We propose to lift the open-set 2D detection into 3D space through our designed
3D bounding box head, enabling end-to-end joint training for both 2D and 3D
tasks to yield better overall performance. We condition the object queries with
geometry prior and overcome the generalization for 3D estimation across diverse
scenes. To further improve performance, we design the canonical image space for
more efficient cross-dataset training. We evaluate 3D-MOOD on both closed-set
settings (Omni3D) and open-set settings (Omni3D to Argoverse 2, ScanNet), and
achieve new state-of-the-art results. Code and models are available at

Conclusion: GSFFs为视觉定位提供了高效且隐私保护的解决方案。

Abstract: Visual localization is the task of estimating a camera pose in a known
environment. In this paper, we utilize 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)-based
representations for accurate and privacy-preserving visual localization. We
propose Gaussian Splatting Feature Fields (GSFFs), a scene representation for
visual localization that combines an explicit geometry model (3DGS) with an
implicit feature field. We leverage the dense geometric information and
differentiable rasterization algorithm from 3DGS to learn robust feature
representations grounded in 3D. In particular, we align a 3D scale-aware
feature field and a 2D feature encoder in a common embedding space through a
contrastive framework. Using a 3D structure-informed clustering procedure, we
further regularize the representation learning and seamlessly convert the
features to segmentations, which can be used for privacy-preserving visual
localization. Pose refinement, which involves aligning either feature maps or
segmentations from a query image with those rendered from the GSFFs scene
representation, is used to achieve localization. The resulting privacy- and
non-privacy-preserving localization pipelines, evaluated on multiple real-world
datasets, show state-of-the-art performances.

Conclusion: BeyondGloss框架有效解决了手语翻译中的关键问题，性能优越。

Abstract: Sign Language Translation (SLT) is a challenging task that requires bridging
the modality gap between visual and linguistic information while capturing
subtle variations in hand shapes and movements. To address these challenges, we
introduce \textbf{BeyondGloss}, a novel gloss-free SLT framework that leverages
the spatio-temporal reasoning capabilities of Video Large Language Models
(VideoLLMs). Since existing VideoLLMs struggle to model long videos in detail,
we propose a novel approach to generate fine-grained, temporally-aware textual
descriptions of hand motion. A contrastive alignment module aligns these
descriptions with video features during pre-training, encouraging the model to
focus on hand-centric temporal dynamics and distinguish signs more effectively.
To further enrich hand-specific representations, we distill fine-grained
features from HaMeR. Additionally, we apply a contrastive loss between sign
video representations and target language embeddings to reduce the modality gap
in pre-training. \textbf{BeyondGloss} achieves state-of-the-art performance on
the Phoenix14T and CSL-Daily benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of the
proposed framework. We will release the code upon acceptance of the paper.

Conclusion: MamV2XCalib在V2X场景中实现了更优且稳定的校准性能，参数更少。

Abstract: As cooperative systems that leverage roadside cameras to assist autonomous
vehicle perception become increasingly widespread, large-scale precise
calibration of infrastructure cameras has become a critical issue. Traditional
manual calibration methods are often time-consuming, labor-intensive, and may
require road closures. This paper proposes MamV2XCalib, the first V2X-based
infrastructure camera calibration method with the assistance of vehicle-side
LiDAR. MamV2XCalib only requires autonomous vehicles equipped with LiDAR to
drive near the cameras to be calibrated in the infrastructure, without the need
for specific reference objects or manual intervention. We also introduce a new
targetless LiDAR-camera calibration method, which combines multi-scale features
and a 4D correlation volume to estimate the correlation between vehicle-side
point clouds and roadside images. We model the temporal information and
estimate the rotation angles with Mamba, effectively addressing calibration
failures in V2X scenarios caused by defects in the vehicle-side data (such as
occlusions) and large differences in viewpoint. We evaluate MamV2XCalib on the
V2X-Seq and TUMTraf-V2X real-world datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness
and robustness of our V2X-based automatic calibration approach. Compared to
previous LiDAR-camera methods designed for calibration on one car, our approach
achieves better and more stable calibration performance in V2X scenarios with
fewer parameters. The code is available at

Conclusion: MoGA通过结合生成模型和扩散模型，成功实现了高保真3D化身重建，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: We present MoGA, a novel method to reconstruct high-fidelity 3D Gaussian
avatars from a single-view image. The main challenge lies in inferring unseen
appearance and geometric details while ensuring 3D consistency and realism.
Most previous methods rely on 2D diffusion models to synthesize unseen views;
however, these generated views are sparse and inconsistent, resulting in
unrealistic 3D artifacts and blurred appearance. To address these limitations,
we leverage a generative avatar model, that can generate diverse 3D avatars by
sampling deformed Gaussians from a learned prior distribution. Due to the
limited amount of 3D training data such a 3D model alone cannot capture all
image details of unseen identities. Consequently, we integrate it as a prior,
ensuring 3D consistency by projecting input images into its latent space and
enforcing additional 3D appearance and geometric constraints. Our novel
approach formulates Gaussian avatar creation as a model inversion process by
fitting the generative avatar to synthetic views from 2D diffusion models. The
generative avatar provides a meaningful initialization for model fitting,
enforces 3D regularization, and helps in refining pose estimation. Experiments
show that our method surpasses state-of-the-art techniques and generalizes well
to real-world scenarios. Our Gaussian avatars are also inherently animatable

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于方向性纯2D方法的高效3D占用预测方法，平衡了精度与实时性需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前许多方法在追求高精度时牺牲了实时处理能力，而自动驾驶系统需要同时满足高精度和实时性。

Method: 通过切片3D体素特征保留垂直几何信息，结合方向性注意力机制提取多方向几何特征。

Result: 在Occ3D-nuScenes上达到39.3%的mIoU和27.7 FPS的推理速度，边缘设备上为14.8 FPS。

Conclusion: 该方法在精度和效率间取得了平衡，适用于资源受限的实时自动驾驶场景。

Abstract: Efficient and high-accuracy 3D occupancy prediction is crucial for ensuring
the performance of autonomous driving (AD) systems. However, many current
methods focus on high accuracy at the expense of real-time processing needs. To
address this challenge of balancing accuracy and inference speed, we propose a
directional pure 2D approach. Our method involves slicing 3D voxel features to
preserve complete vertical geometric information. This strategy compensates for
the loss of height cues in Bird's-Eye View (BEV) representations, thereby
maintaining the integrity of the 3D geometric structure. By employing a
directional attention mechanism, we efficiently extract geometric features from
different orientations, striking a balance between accuracy and computational
efficiency. Experimental results highlight the significant advantages of our
approach for autonomous driving. On the Occ3D-nuScenes, the proposed method
achieves an mIoU of 39.3% and an inference speed of 27.7 FPS, effectively
balancing accuracy and efficiency. In simulations on edge devices, the
inference speed reaches 14.8 FPS, further demonstrating the method's
applicability for real-time deployment in resource-constrained environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于时空频率运动感知的视频伪装目标检测方法Vcamba，结合空间和频率特征，显著提升了检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖空间外观特征，但前景与背景的高相似性限制了检测精度，频率特征和Mamba模型的长序列建模能力为解决这一问题提供了新思路。

Method: 设计了RFVSS模块提取多尺度空间特征，AFE模块增强频率特征，SLMP和FLMP模块分别建模时空和频率时序序列，SFMF模块融合双域特征。

Result: 在2个数据集上优于现有方法，6项评价指标表现更优，且计算成本更低。

Conclusion: Vcamba通过结合空间和频率特征，显著提升了视频伪装目标检测的准确性和效率。

Abstract: Existing video camouflaged object detection (VCOD) methods primarily rely on
spatial appearance features to perceive motion cues for breaking camouflage.
However, the high similarity between foreground and background in VCOD results
in limited discriminability of spatial appearance features (e.g., color and
texture), restricting detection accuracy and completeness. Recent studies
demonstrate that frequency features can not only enhance feature representation
to compensate for appearance limitations but also perceive motion through
dynamic variations in frequency energy. Furthermore, the emerging state space
model called Mamba, enables efficient perception of motion cues in frame
sequences due to its linear-time long-sequence modeling capability. Motivated
by this, we propose a novel visual camouflage Mamba (Vcamba) based on
spatio-frequency motion perception that integrates frequency and spatial
features for efficient and accurate VCOD. Specifically, we propose a receptive
field visual state space (RFVSS) module to extract multi-scale spatial features
after sequence modeling. For frequency learning, we introduce an adaptive
frequency component enhancement (AFE) module with a novel frequency-domain
sequential scanning strategy to maintain semantic consistency. Then we propose
a space-based long-range motion perception (SLMP) module and a frequency-based
long-range motion perception (FLMP) module to model spatio-temporal and
frequency-temporal sequences in spatial and frequency phase domains. Finally,
the space and frequency motion fusion module (SFMF) integrates dual-domain
features for unified motion representation. Experimental results show that our
Vcamba outperforms state-of-the-art methods across 6 evaluation metrics on 2
datasets with lower computation cost, confirming the superiority of Vcamba. Our
code is available at: https://github.com/BoydeLi/Vcamba.

TL;DR: DivControl提出了一种可分解的预训练框架，通过知识分散和多条件训练实现统一可控生成和高效适应，显著降低训练成本并提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在图像到图像生成中要么为每个条件训练单独模型，要么依赖纠缠表示的统一架构，导致泛化能力差和适应成本高。

Method: DivControl通过SVD分解ControlNet为基本组件，利用动态门实现知识分散，并通过表示对齐损失提升条件保真度和训练效率。

Result: DivControl在可控性上达到SOTA，训练成本降低36.4倍，同时在基本条件和未见条件上表现优异。

Conclusion: DivControl展示了卓越的可扩展性、模块化和迁移能力，为统一可控生成提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models have advanced from text-to-image (T2I) to image-to-image
(I2I) generation by incorporating structured inputs such as depth maps,
enabling fine-grained spatial control. However, existing methods either train
separate models for each condition or rely on unified architectures with
entangled representations, resulting in poor generalization and high adaptation
costs for novel conditions. To this end, we propose DivControl, a decomposable
pretraining framework for unified controllable generation and efficient
adaptation. DivControl factorizes ControlNet via SVD into basic
components-pairs of singular vectors-which are disentangled into
condition-agnostic learngenes and condition-specific tailors through knowledge
diversion during multi-condition training. Knowledge diversion is implemented
via a dynamic gate that performs soft routing over tailors based on the
semantics of condition instructions, enabling zero-shot generalization and
parameter-efficient adaptation to novel conditions. To further improve
condition fidelity and training efficiency, we introduce a representation
alignment loss that aligns condition embeddings with early diffusion features.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that DivControl achieves state-of-the-art
controllability with 36.4$\times$ less training cost, while simultaneously
improving average performance on basic conditions. It also delivers strong
zero-shot and few-shot performance on unseen conditions, demonstrating superior
scalability, modularity, and transferability.

Motivation: 确保医疗图像共享符合患者隐私法律（如HIPAA），同时保留非PHI元数据以支持AI研究。

Method: 采用三阶段（训练、验证、测试）挑战赛形式，使用合成PHI/PII的DICOM图像评估工具性能。

Result: 十支团队完成测试，得分范围97.91%至99.93%，使用了开源、专有工具及OCR等技术。

Conclusion: MIDI-B挑战赛为去标识化工具提供了标准化评估平台，展示了规则方法的有效性。

Abstract: The de-identification (deID) of protected health information (PHI) and
personally identifiable information (PII) is a fundamental requirement for
sharing medical images, particularly through public repositories, to ensure
compliance with patient privacy laws. In addition, preservation of non-PHI
metadata to inform and enable downstream development of imaging artificial
intelligence (AI) is an important consideration in biomedical research. The
goal of MIDI-B was to provide a standardized platform for benchmarking of DICOM
image deID tools based on a set of rules conformant to the HIPAA Safe Harbor
regulation, the DICOM Attribute Confidentiality Profiles, and best practices in
preservation of research-critical metadata, as defined by The Cancer Imaging
Archive (TCIA). The challenge employed a large, diverse, multi-center, and
multi-modality set of real de-identified radiology images with synthetic
PHI/PII inserted.
  The MIDI-B Challenge consisted of three phases: training, validation, and
test. Eighty individuals registered for the challenge. In the training phase,
we encouraged participants to tune their algorithms using their in-house or
public data. The validation and test phases utilized the DICOM images
containing synthetic identifiers (of 216 and 322 subjects, respectively). Ten
teams successfully completed the test phase of the challenge. To measure
success of a rule-based approach to image deID, scores were computed as the
percentage of correct actions from the total number of required actions. The
scores ranged from 97.91% to 99.93%. Participants employed a variety of
open-source and proprietary tools with customized configurations, large
language models, and optical character recognition (OCR). In this paper we
provide a comprehensive report on the MIDI-B Challenge's design,
implementation, results, and lessons learned.

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) provides rich spectral information for medical
imaging, yet encounters significant challenges due to data limitations and
hardware variations. We introduce SAMSA, a novel interactive segmentation
framework that combines an RGB foundation model with spectral analysis. SAMSA
efficiently utilizes user clicks to guide both RGB segmentation and spectral

segmentation through a unique spectral feature fusion strategy that operates
independently of spectral band count and resolution. Performance evaluation on
publicly available datasets has shown 81.0% 1-click and 93.4% 5-click DICE on a
neurosurgical and 81.1% 1-click and 89.2% 5-click DICE on an intraoperative
porcine hyperspectral dataset. Experimental results demonstrate SAMSA's
effectiveness in few-shot and zero-shot learning scenarios and using minimal

different spectral characteristics, providing a flexible framework for
hyperspectral medical image analysis.

Conclusion: 该研究为开发更鲁棒的可解释模型提供了重要贡献。

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) and other concept-based interpretable models
show great promise for making AI applications more transparent, which is
essential in fields like medicine. Despite their success, we demonstrate that
CBMs struggle to reliably identify the correct concepts under distribution
shifts. To assess the robustness of CBMs to concept variations, we introduce
SUB: a fine-grained image and concept benchmark containing 38,400 synthetic
images based on the CUB dataset. To create SUB, we select a CUB subset of 33
bird classes and 45 concepts to generate images which substitute a specific
concept, such as wing color or belly pattern. We introduce a novel Tied
Diffusion Guidance (TDG) method to precisely control generated images, where
noise sharing for two parallel denoising processes ensures that both the
correct bird class and the correct attribute are generated. This novel
benchmark enables rigorous evaluation of CBMs and similar interpretable models,

Motivation: 当前少样本分类和分割方法在小物体上表现不佳，且现有评估设置未充分利用昂贵的标注数据。

Method: EMAT引入了三种改进：内存高效的掩码注意力机制、可学习的降采样策略和参数效率增强。

Result: EMAT在PASCAL-5$^i$和COCO-20$^i$数据集上表现优于现有方法，且参数更少。

Conclusion: EMAT显著提升了少样本分类和分割的性能，并提出了更实用的评估设置。

Abstract: Few-shot classification and segmentation (FS-CS) focuses on jointly
performing multi-label classification and multi-class segmentation using few
annotated examples. Although the current state of the art (SOTA) achieves high
accuracy in both tasks, it struggles with small objects. To overcome this, we
propose the Efficient Masked Attention Transformer (EMAT), which improves
classification and segmentation accuracy, especially for small objects. EMAT
introduces three modifications: a novel memory-efficient masked attention
mechanism, a learnable downscaling strategy, and parameter-efficiency
enhancements. EMAT outperforms all FS-CS methods on the PASCAL-5$^i$ and
COCO-20$^i$ datasets, using at least four times fewer trainable parameters.
Moreover, as the current FS-CS evaluation setting discards available
annotations, despite their costly collection, we introduce two novel evaluation
settings that consider these annotations to better reflect practical scenarios.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer a biologically plausible framework for
energy-efficient neuromorphic computing. However, it is a challenge to train
SNNs due to their non-differentiability, efficiently. Existing gradient
approximation approaches frequently sacrifice accuracy and face deployment
limitations on edge devices due to the substantial computational requirements
of backpropagation. To address these challenges, we propose a Forward-Forward
(FF) based gradient approximation-free training framework for Spiking Neural
Networks, which treats spiking activations as black-box modules, thereby
eliminating the need for gradient approximation while significantly reducing
computational complexity. Furthermore, we introduce a class-aware complexity
adaptation mechanism that dynamically optimizes the loss function based on
inter-class difficulty metrics, enabling efficient allocation of network
resources across different categories. Experimental results demonstrate that
our proposed training framework achieves test accuracies of 99.58%, 92.13%, and
75.64% on the MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10 datasets, respectively,

Abstract: Medical image annotation is constrained by privacy concerns and
labor-intensive labeling, significantly limiting the performance and

excel in synthesis, they struggle with precise lesion-mask alignment. We
propose \textbf{Adaptively Distilled ControlNet}, a task-agnostic framework
that accelerates training and optimization through dual-model distillation.
Specifically, during training, a teacher model, conditioned on mask-image
pairs, regularizes a mask-only student model via predicted noise alignment in
parameter space, further enhanced by adaptive regularization based on
lesion-background ratios. During sampling, only the student model is used,
enabling privacy-preserving medical image generation. Comprehensive evaluations
on two distinct medical datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance:
TransUNet improves mDice/mIoU by 2.4%/4.2% on KiTS19, while SANet achieves

Conclusion: 显式条件化时间元数据是解决零样本迁移问题的有效方法，OmniTraj模型表现优异。

Abstract: While large-scale pre-training has advanced human trajectory prediction, a
critical challenge remains: zero-shot transfer to unseen dataset with varying
temporal dynamics. State-of-the-art pre-trained models often require
fine-tuning to adapt to new datasets with different frame rates or observation
horizons, limiting their scalability and practical utility. In this work, we
systematically investigate this limitation and propose a robust solution. We
first demonstrate that existing data-aware discrete models struggle when
transferred to new scenarios with shifted temporal setups. We then isolate the
temporal generalization from dataset shift, revealing that a simple, explicit
conditioning mechanism for temporal metadata is a highly effective solution.
Based on this insight, we present OmniTraj, a Transformer-based model
pre-trained on a large-scale, heterogeneous dataset. Our experiments show that
explicitly conditioning on the frame rate enables OmniTraj to achieve
state-of-the-art zero-shot transfer performance, reducing prediction error by
over 70\% in challenging cross-setup scenarios. After fine-tuning, OmniTraj
achieves state-of-the-art results on four datasets, including NBA, JTA,
WorldPose, and ETH-UCY. The code is publicly available:

Conclusion: I2V-GS是首个实现基础设施-车辆视图转换的框架，为自动驾驶数据生成提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Vast and high-quality data are essential for end-to-end autonomous driving
systems. However, current driving data is mainly collected by vehicles, which
is expensive and inefficient. A potential solution lies in synthesizing data
from real-world images. Recent advancements in 3D reconstruction demonstrate
photorealistic novel view synthesis, highlighting the potential of generating
driving data from images captured on the road. This paper introduces a novel
method, I2V-GS, to transfer the Infrastructure view To the Vehicle view with
Gaussian Splatting. Reconstruction from sparse infrastructure viewpoints and
rendering under large view transformations is a challenging problem. We adopt
the adaptive depth warp to generate dense training views. To further expand the
range of views, we employ a cascade strategy to inpaint warped images, which
also ensures inpainting content is consistent across views. To further ensure
the reliability of the diffusion model, we utilize the cross-view information
to perform a confidenceguided optimization. Moreover, we introduce RoadSight, a
multi-modality, multi-view dataset from real scenarios in infrastructure views.
To our knowledge, I2V-GS is the first framework to generate autonomous driving
datasets with infrastructure-vehicle view transformation. Experimental results
demonstrate that I2V-GS significantly improves synthesis quality under vehicle
view, outperforming StreetGaussian in NTA-Iou, NTL-Iou, and FID by 45.7%,
34.2%, and 14.9%, respectively.

the decoder to enhance texture and fine-structure recovery. Extensive

our method consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, highlighting the
practical potential of diffusion priors for unified image restoration. Our code

Result: 在多视图动态重建和新视角合成中取得显著视觉提升（PSNR增益超过2.5 dB），减少动态纹理模糊。

Conclusion: FlowGaussian-VR有效解决了动态场景重建中的挑战，提升了视觉质量和轨迹跟踪性。

Abstract: High-fidelity 3D video reconstruction is essential for enabling real-time
rendering of dynamic scenes with realistic motion in virtual and augmented
reality (VR/AR). The deformation field paradigm of 3D Gaussian splatting has
achieved near-photorealistic results in video reconstruction due to the great
representation capability of deep deformation networks. However, in videos with
complex motion and significant scale variations, deformation networks often
overfit to irregular Gaussian trajectories, leading to suboptimal visual
quality. Moreover, the gradient-based densification strategy designed for
static scene reconstruction proves inadequate to address the absence of dynamic
content. In light of these challenges, we propose a flow-empowered velocity
field modeling scheme tailored for Gaussian video reconstruction, dubbed
FlowGaussian-VR. It consists of two core components: a velocity field rendering
(VFR) pipeline which enables optical flow-based optimization, and a
flow-assisted adaptive densification (FAD) strategy that adjusts the number and
size of Gaussians in dynamic regions. We validate our model's effectiveness on
multi-view dynamic reconstruction and novel view synthesis with multiple
real-world datasets containing challenging motion scenarios, demonstrating not
only notable visual improvements (over 2.5 dB gain in PSNR) and less blurry
artifacts in dynamic textures, but also regularized and trackable per-Gaussian
trajectories.

Abstract: The deployment of Machine Learning models intraoperatively for tissue
characterisation can assist decision making and guide safe tumour resections.
For image classification models, pixel attribution methods are popular to infer
explainability. However, overconfidence in deep learning model's predictions
translates to overconfidence in pixel attribution. In this paper, we propose
the first approach which incorporates risk estimation into a pixel attribution
method for improved image classification explainability. The proposed method
iteratively applies a classification model with a pixel attribution method to
create a volume of PA maps. This volume is used for the first time, to generate
a pixel-wise distribution of PA values. We introduce a method to generate an
enhanced PA map by estimating the expectation values of the pixel-wise
distributions. In addition, the coefficient of variation (CV) is used to
estimate pixel-wise risk of this enhanced PA map. Hence, the proposed method
not only provides an improved PA map but also produces an estimation of risk on
the output PA values. Performance evaluation on probe-based Confocal Laser
Endomicroscopy (pCLE) data and ImageNet verifies that our improved
explainability method outperforms the state-of-the-art.

Conclusion: 该方法首次实现了完全数据驱动的功能映射正则化和训练，具有类别无关性，并能有效替代传统策略。

Abstract: Deep functional maps have recently emerged as a powerful tool for solving
non-rigid shape correspondence tasks. Methods that use this approach combine
the power and flexibility of the functional map framework, with data-driven
learning for improved accuracy and generality. However, most existing methods
in this area restrict the learning aspect only to the feature functions and
still rely on axiomatic modeling for formulating the training loss or for
functional map regularization inside the networks. This limits both the
accuracy and the applicability of the resulting approaches only to scenarios
where assumptions of the axiomatic models hold. In this work, we show, for the
first time, that both in-network regularization and functional map training can
be replaced with data-driven methods. For this, we first train a generative
model of functional maps in the spectral domain using score-based generative
modeling, built from a large collection of high-quality maps. We then exploit
the resulting model to promote the structural properties of ground truth
functional maps on new shape collections. Remarkably, we demonstrate that the
learned models are category-agnostic, and can fully replace commonly used
strategies such as enforcing Laplacian commutativity or orthogonality of
functional maps. Our key technical contribution is a novel distillation
strategy from diffusion models in the spectral domain. Experiments demonstrate
that our learned regularization leads to better results than axiomatic
approaches for zero-shot non-rigid shape matching. Our code is available at:

TL;DR: DIAS通过重新初始化和自蒸馏改进Slot Attention，减少冗余并提升对象表示，在对象发现和识别任务中达到SOTA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Slot Attention方法存在冗余槽竞争和对象分割错误问题，且缺乏内部信息的监督信号。

Method: 提出DIAS：i) 减少冗余槽并重新初始化；ii) 通过自蒸馏优化注意力图。

Result: DIAS在对象发现和识别任务中表现最佳，同时提升视觉预测和推理能力。

Conclusion: DIAS通过改进Slot Attention机制，显著提升了对象中心学习的性能。

Abstract: Unlike popular solutions based on dense feature maps, Object-Centric Learning
(OCL) represents visual scenes as sub-symbolic object-level feature vectors,
termed slots, which are highly versatile for tasks involving visual modalities.
OCL typically aggregates object superpixels into slots by iteratively applying
competitive cross attention, known as Slot Attention, with the slots as the
query. However, once initialized, these slots are reused naively, causing
redundant slots to compete with informative ones for representing objects. This
often results in objects being erroneously segmented into parts. Additionally,
mainstream methods derive supervision signals solely from decoding slots into
the input's reconstruction, overlooking potential supervision based on internal
information. To address these issues, we propose Slot Attention with
re-Initialization and self-Distillation (DIAS): $\emph{i)}$ We reduce
redundancy in the aggregated slots and re-initialize extra aggregation to
update the remaining slots; $\emph{ii)}$ We drive the bad attention map at the
first aggregation iteration to approximate the good at the last iteration to
enable self-distillation. Experiments demonstrate that DIAS achieves
state-of-the-art on OCL tasks like object discovery and recognition, while also
improving advanced visual prediction and reasoning. Our code is available on

Motivation: 现有基于3D高斯泼溅的方法局限于单对象单步交互，无法满足复杂现实任务的需求。

Method: 提出SeqSplatNet框架，结合大语言模型和条件解码器生成3D功能区域掩码，并引入预训练策略和特征注入机制。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在SeqAffordSplat基准上达到新SOTA，实现了从单步到复杂场景级任务的扩展。

Conclusion: SeqSplatNet有效推动了功能区域推理从单步交互到复杂长时程任务的发展。

Abstract: 3D affordance reasoning, the task of associating human instructions with the
functional regions of 3D objects, is a critical capability for embodied agents.
Current methods based on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) are fundamentally limited
to single-object, single-step interactions, a paradigm that falls short of
addressing the long-horizon, multi-object tasks required for complex real-world
applications. To bridge this gap, we introduce the novel task of Sequential 3D
Gaussian Affordance Reasoning and establish SeqAffordSplat, a large-scale
benchmark featuring 1800+ scenes to support research on long-horizon affordance
understanding in complex 3DGS environments. We then propose SeqSplatNet, an
end-to-end framework that directly maps an instruction to a sequence of 3D
affordance masks. SeqSplatNet employs a large language model that
autoregressively generates text interleaved with special segmentation tokens,
guiding a conditional decoder to produce the corresponding 3D mask. To handle
complex scene geometry, we introduce a pre-training strategy, Conditional
Geometric Reconstruction, where the model learns to reconstruct complete
affordance region masks from known geometric observations, thereby building a
robust geometric prior. Furthermore, to resolve semantic ambiguities, we design
a feature injection mechanism that lifts rich semantic features from 2D Vision
Foundation Models (VFM) and fuses them into the 3D decoder at multiple scales.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method sets a new state-of-the-art
on our challenging benchmark, effectively advancing affordance reasoning from
single-step interactions to complex, sequential tasks at the scene level.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D人体模型（如SMPL-X）缺乏物理交互能力，导致穿模和不真实的物体动态问题。

Method: 提出“半物理”机制，将运动学动作转化为物理模拟，保持对姿势的运动学控制，同时实现物理交互。

Result: 方法无需学习，实时运行，适用于任意体型和动作，消除穿模和不真实动态。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持运动学动作保真度的同时，实现了无缝的物理交互。

Abstract: While current general-purpose 3D human models (e.g., SMPL-X) efficiently
represent accurate human shape and pose, they lacks the ability to physically
interact with the environment due to the kinematic nature. As a result,
kinematic-based interaction models often suffer from issues such as
interpenetration and unrealistic object dynamics. To address this limitation,
we introduce a novel approach that embeds SMPL-X into a tangible entity capable
of dynamic physical interactions with its surroundings. Specifically, we
propose a "half-physics" mechanism that transforms 3D kinematic motion into a
physics simulation. Our approach maintains kinematic control over inherent
SMPL-X poses while ensuring physically plausible interactions with scenes and
objects, effectively eliminating penetration and unrealistic object dynamics.
Unlike reinforcement learning-based methods, which demand extensive and complex
training, our half-physics method is learning-free and generalizes to any body
shape and motion; meanwhile, it operates in real time. Moreover, it preserves
the fidelity of the original kinematic motion while seamlessly integrating
physical interactions

Motivation: GUI接地是计算机使用代理（CUAs）执行实际动作的核心，但现有端到端模型在复杂基准上准确率低于65%，远未达到部署要求。

Method: 通过实证研究，从数据收集到模型训练，开发了Phi-Ground模型家族。

Conclusion: 论文不仅明确了接地模型的构建细节，还为其他感知任务提供了借鉴。

Abstract: With the development of multimodal reasoning models, Computer Use Agents
(CUAs), akin to Jarvis from \textit{"Iron Man"}, are becoming a reality. GUI
grounding is a core component for CUAs to execute actual actions, similar to
mechanical control in robotics, and it directly leads to the success or failure
of the system. It determines actions such as clicking and typing, as well as
related parameters like the coordinates for clicks. Current end-to-end
grounding models still achieve less than 65\% accuracy on challenging
benchmarks like ScreenSpot-pro and UI-Vision, indicating they are far from
being ready for deployment. % , as a single misclick can result in unacceptable
consequences. In this work, we conduct an empirical study on the training of
grounding models, examining details from data collection to model training.
Ultimately, we developed the \textbf{Phi-Ground} model family, which achieves
state-of-the-art performance across all five grounding benchmarks for models
under $10B$ parameters in agent settings. In the end-to-end model setting, our
model still achieves SOTA results with scores of \textit{\textbf{43.2}} on
ScreenSpot-pro and \textit{\textbf{27.2}} on UI-Vision. We believe that the
various details discussed in this paper, along with our successes and failures,
not only clarify the construction of grounding models but also benefit other
perception tasks. Project homepage:

TL;DR: 提出一种从稀疏视角视频重建动态场景的方法，解决了传统多视角密集重建的高成本和场景限制问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法需要密集多视角（如数百个校准相机），成本高且无法适应野外场景。本研究旨在用少量稀疏视角相机（如四个静态相机）重建动态行为。

Method: 通过独立单目重建并精心对齐，生成时间和视角一致的动态场景重建。

Result: 在PanopticStudio和Ego-Exo4D数据集上实验表明，该方法在渲染新视角时优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 该方法在稀疏视角下实现了高质量动态场景重建，代码和数据已开源。

Abstract: We address the problem of dynamic scene reconstruction from sparse-view
videos. Prior work often requires dense multi-view captures with hundreds of
calibrated cameras (e.g. Panoptic Studio). Such multi-view setups are
prohibitively expensive to build and cannot capture diverse scenes in-the-wild.
In contrast, we aim to reconstruct dynamic human behaviors, such as repairing a
bike or dancing, from a small set of sparse-view cameras with complete scene
coverage (e.g. four equidistant inward-facing static cameras). We find that
dense multi-view reconstruction methods struggle to adapt to this sparse-view
setup due to limited overlap between viewpoints. To address these limitations,
we carefully align independent monocular reconstructions of each camera to
produce time- and view-consistent dynamic scene reconstructions. Extensive
experiments on PanopticStudio and Ego-Exo4D demonstrate that our method
achieves higher quality reconstructions than prior art, particularly when
rendering novel views. Code, data, and data-processing scripts are available on

Motivation: 直接4D扩散建模由于数据构建成本高和3D形状、外观和运动联合表示的高维性而极具挑战性。

Method: 引入Direct 4DMesh-to-GS Variation Field VAE，直接编码规范GS及其时间变化，压缩高维动画到紧凑潜在空间，并训练高斯变化场扩散模型。

Result: 在Objaverse数据集上训练的模型表现出优于现有方法的生成质量，并对野外视频输入具有显著泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该框架为生成高质量动画3D内容开辟了新途径。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel framework for video-to-4D generation that
creates high-quality dynamic 3D content from single video inputs. Direct 4D
diffusion modeling is extremely challenging due to costly data construction and
the high-dimensional nature of jointly representing 3D shape, appearance, and
motion. We address these challenges by introducing a Direct 4DMesh-to-GS
Variation Field VAE that directly encodes canonical Gaussian Splats (GS) and
their temporal variations from 3D animation data without per-instance fitting,
and compresses high-dimensional animations into a compact latent space.
Building upon this efficient representation, we train a Gaussian Variation
Field diffusion model with temporal-aware Diffusion Transformer conditioned on
input videos and canonical GS. Trained on carefully-curated animatable 3D
objects from the Objaverse dataset, our model demonstrates superior generation
quality compared to existing methods. It also exhibits remarkable
generalization to in-the-wild video inputs despite being trained exclusively on
synthetic data, paving the way for generating high-quality animated 3D content.

Abstract: Dormant tree pruning is labor-intensive but essential to maintaining modern
highly-productive fruit orchards. In this work we present a closed-loop
visuomotor controller for robotic pruning. The controller guides the cutter
through a cluttered tree environment to reach a specified cut point and ensures
the cutters are perpendicular to the branch. We train the controller using a
novel orchard simulation that captures the geometric distribution of branches
in a target apple orchard configuration. Unlike traditional methods requiring
full 3D reconstruction, our controller uses just optical flow images from a
wrist-mounted camera. We deploy our learned policy in simulation and the
real-world for an example V-Trellis envy tree with zero-shot transfer,
achieving a 30% success rate -- approximately half the performance of an oracle
planner.

Abstract: Automatic extrinsic sensor calibration is a fundamental problem for
multi-sensor platforms. Reliable and general-purpose solutions should be
computationally efficient, require few assumptions about the structure of the
sensing environment, and demand little effort from human operators. Since the
engineering effort required to obtain accurate calibration parameters increases
with the number of sensors deployed, robotics researchers have pursued methods
requiring few assumptions about the sensing environment and minimal effort from
human operators. In this work, we introduce a fast and certifiably globally
optimal algorithm for solving a generalized formulation of the
$\textit{robot-world and hand-eye calibration}$ (RWHEC) problem. The
formulation of RWHEC presented is "generalized" in that it supports the
simultaneous estimation of multiple sensor and target poses, and permits the
use of monocular cameras that, alone, are unable to measure the scale of their
environments. In addition to demonstrating our method's superior performance
over existing solutions, we derive novel identifiability criteria and establish
$\textit{a priori}$ guarantees of global optimality for problem instances with
bounded measurement errors. We also introduce a complementary Lie-algebraic
local solver for RWHEC and compare its performance with our global method and
prior art. Finally, we provide a free and open-source implementation of our
algorithms and experiments.

Abstract: Quadruped robots face persistent challenges in achieving versatile locomotion
due to limitations in reference motion data diversity. To address these
challenges, this approach introduces an in-between motion generation based
multi-style quadruped robot locomotion framework, integrating synergistic
advances in motion generation and imitation learning. Our approach establishes
a unified pipeline addressing two fundamental aspects: First, we propose a CVAE
based motion generator, synthesizing multi-style dynamically feasible
locomotion sequences between arbitrary start and end states. By embedding
physical constraints and leveraging joint poses based phase manifold
continuity, this component produces physically plausible motions spanning
multiple gait modalities while ensuring kinematic compatibility with robotic
morphologies. Second, we adopt the adversarial motion priors algorithm. We
validate the effectiveness of generated motion data in enhancing controller
stability and improving velocity tracking performance. The proposed framework
demonstrates significant improvements in velocity tracking and deployment
stability. We successfully deploy the framework on a real-world quadruped
robot, and the experimental validation confirms the framework's capability to
generate and execute complex motion profiles, including gallop, tripod,
trotting and pacing.

Abstract: Emerging surgical data science and robotics solutions, especially those
designed to provide assistance in situ, require natural human-machine
interfaces to fully unlock their potential in providing adaptive and intuitive
aid. Contemporary AI-driven solutions remain inherently rigid, offering limited
flexibility and restricting natural human-machine interaction in dynamic
surgical environments. These solutions rely heavily on extensive task-specific
pre-training, fixed object categories, and explicit manual-prompting. This work
introduces a novel Perception Agent that leverages speech-integrated
prompt-engineered large language models (LLMs), segment anything model (SAM),
and any-point tracking foundation models to enable a more natural human-machine
interaction in real-time intraoperative surgical assistance. Incorporating a
memory repository and two novel mechanisms for segmenting unseen elements,
Perception Agent offers the flexibility to segment both known and unseen
elements in the surgical scene through intuitive interaction. Incorporating the
ability to memorize novel elements for use in future surgeries, this work takes
a marked step towards human-machine symbiosis in surgical procedures. Through
quantitative analysis on a public dataset, we show that the performance of our
agent is on par with considerably more labor-intensive manual-prompting
strategies. Qualitatively, we show the flexibility of our agent in segmenting
novel elements (instruments, phantom grafts, and gauze) in a custom-curated
dataset. By offering natural human-machine interaction and overcoming rigidity,
our Perception Agent potentially brings AI-based real-time assistance in
dynamic surgical environments closer to reality.

Conclusion: MTBench为MTRL研究提供了高效评估工具，并展示了大规模并行化的潜力与挑战。

Abstract: Multi-task Reinforcement Learning (MTRL) has emerged as a critical training
paradigm for applying reinforcement learning (RL) to a set of complex
real-world robotic tasks, which demands a generalizable and robust policy. At
the same time, \emph{massively parallelized training} has gained popularity,
not only for significantly accelerating data collection through GPU-accelerated
simulation but also for enabling diverse data collection across multiple tasks
by simulating heterogeneous scenes in parallel. However, existing MTRL research
has largely been limited to off-policy methods like SAC in the
low-parallelization regime. MTRL could capitalize on the higher asymptotic
performance of on-policy algorithms, whose batches require data from the
current policy, and as a result, take advantage of massive parallelization
offered by GPU-accelerated simulation. To bridge this gap, we introduce a
massively parallelized $\textbf{M}$ulti-$\textbf{T}$ask $\textbf{Bench}$mark
for robotics (MTBench), an open-sourced benchmark featuring a broad
distribution of 50 manipulation tasks and 20 locomotion tasks, implemented
using the GPU-accelerated simulator IsaacGym. MTBench also includes four base
RL algorithms combined with seven state-of-the-art MTRL algorithms and
architectures, providing a unified framework for evaluating their performance.
Our extensive experiments highlight the superior speed of evaluating MTRL
approaches using MTBench, while also uncovering unique challenges that arise
from combining massive parallelism with MTRL. Code is available at

Abstract: There has been significant advancement in legged robot's agility where they
can show impressive acrobatic maneuvers, such as parkour. These maneuvers rely
heavily on posture manipulation. To expand the stability and locomotion
plasticity, we use the multi-modal ability in our legged-aerial platform, the
Husky Beta, to perform thruster-assisted walking. This robot has thrusters on
each of its sagittal knee joints which can be used to stabilize its frontal
dynamic as it walks. In this work, we perform a simulation study of quadruped
narrow-path walking with Husky $\beta$, where the robot will utilize its
thrusters to stably walk on a narrow path. The controller is designed based on
a centroidal dynamics model with thruster and foot ground contact forces as
inputs. These inputs are regulated using a QP solver to be used in a model
predictive control framework. In addition to narrow-path walking, we also
perform a lateral push-recovery simulation to study how the thrusters can be
used to stabilize the frontal dynamics.

Abstract: Reconfigurable multi-robot cells offer a promising approach to meet
fluctuating assembly demands. However, the recurrent planning of their
configurations introduces new challenges, particularly in generating optimized,
coordinated multi-robot motion sequences that minimize the assembly duration.
This work presents a simulation-based method for generating such optimized
sequences. The approach separates assembly steps into task-related core
operations and connecting traverse operations. While core operations are
constrained and predetermined, traverse operations offer substantial
optimization potential. Scheduling the core operations is formulated as an
optimization problem, requiring feasible traverse operations to be integrated
using a decomposition-based motion planning strategy. Several solution
techniques are explored, including a sampling heuristic, tree-based search and
gradient-free optimization. For motion planning, a decomposition method is
proposed that identifies specific areas in the schedule, which can be solved
independently with modified centralized path planning algorithms. The proposed
method generates efficient and collision-free multi-robot assembly procedures
that outperform a baseline relying on decentralized, robot-individual motion
planning. Its effectiveness is demonstrated through simulation experiments.

*Jaeseok Park,Chanoh Park,Minsu Kim,Soohwan Kim*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: GSFusion是一种基于LiDAR-惯性-视觉的在线映射系统，通过全局位姿图优化中的surfel-to-surfel约束解决3D高斯溅射（3DGS）与LiDAR集成时的挑战，提升渲染质量和建图效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于相机传感器（包括RGB-D）的3DGS方法存在计算负载高、在纹理或光照差的环境中失效以及操作范围短的问题，而LiDAR虽为替代方案，但其与3DGS集成时面临全局对齐和稀疏数据导致的优化时间长等挑战。

Method: 提出GSFusion系统，采用全局位姿图优化中的surfel-to-surfel约束确保高精度地图一致性，并通过像素感知的高斯初始化策略和边界sigmoid约束处理稀疏数据。

Result: 在公开和自有数据集上的实验表明，GSFusion在渲染质量和建图效率上优于现有3DGS SLAM系统。

Conclusion: GSFusion通过创新的约束和初始化策略，有效解决了LiDAR与3DGS集成的问题，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has revolutionized photorealistic mapping,
conventional approaches based on camera sensor, even RGB-D, suffer from
fundamental limitations such as high computational load, failure in
environments with poor texture or illumination, and short operational ranges.
LiDAR emerges as a robust alternative, but its integration with 3DGS introduces
new challenges, such as the need for exceptional global alignment for
photorealistic quality and prolonged optimization times caused by sparse data.
To address these challenges, we propose GSFusion, an online
LiDAR-Inertial-Visual mapping system that ensures high-precision map
consistency through a surfel-to-surfel constraint in the global pose-graph
optimization. To handle sparse data, our system employs a pixel-aware Gaussian
initialization strategy for efficient representation and a bounded sigmoid
constraint to prevent uncontrolled Gaussian growth. Experiments on public and
our datasets demonstrate our system outperforms existing 3DGS SLAM systems in
terms of rendering quality and map-building efficiency.

Conclusion: 通过仿真和实验验证了方法的有效性，适用于机器人触须传感器的主动控制。

Abstract: Perception using whisker-inspired tactile sensors currently faces a major
challenge: the lack of active control in robots based on direct contact
information from the whisker. To accurately reconstruct object contours, it is
crucial for the whisker sensor to continuously follow and maintain an
appropriate relative touch pose on the surface. This is especially important
for localization based on tip contact, which has a low tolerance for sharp
surfaces and must avoid slipping into tangential contact. In this paper, we
first construct a magnetically transduced whisker sensor featuring a compact
and robust suspension system composed of three flexible spiral arms. We develop
a method that leverages a characterized whisker deflection profile to directly
extract the tip contact position using gradient descent, with a Bayesian filter
applied to reduce fluctuations. We then propose an active motion control policy
to maintain the optimal relative pose of the whisker sensor against the object
surface. A B-Spline curve is employed to predict the local surface curvature
and determine the sensor orientation. Results demonstrate that our algorithm
can effectively track objects and reconstruct contours with sub-millimeter
accuracy. Finally, we validate the method in simulations and real-world
experiments where a robot arm drives the whisker sensor to follow the surfaces
of three different objects.

Abstract: A key challenge in deploying automated vehicles (AVs) is ensuring they make
appropriate decisions in ethically challenging everyday driving situations.
While much attention has been paid to rare, high-stakes dilemmas such as
trolley problems, similar tensions also arise in routine scenarios, such as
navigating empty intersections, where multiple human considerations, including
legality and comfort, often conflict. Current AV planning systems typically
rely on rigid rules, which struggle to balance these competing considerations
and can lead to behaviour that misaligns with human expectations. This paper
proposes a novel reasons-based trajectory evaluation framework that
operationalises the tracking condition of Meaningful Human Control (MHC). The
framework models the reasons of human agents, such as regulatory compliance, as
quantifiable functions and evaluates how well candidate AV trajectories align
with these reasons. By assigning adjustable weights to agent priorities and
integrating a balance function to discourage the exclusion of any agent, the
framework supports interpretable decision evaluation. Through a
real-world-inspired overtaking scenario, we show how this approach reveals
tensions, for instance between regulatory compliance, efficiency, and comfort.
The framework functions as a modular evaluation layer over existing planning
algorithms. It offers a transparent tool for assessing ethical alignment in
everyday scenarios and provides a practical step toward implementing MHC in
real-world AV deployment.

Abstract: Drifting, characterized by controlled vehicle motion at high sideslip angles,
is crucial for safely handling emergency scenarios at the friction limits.
While recent reinforcement learning approaches show promise for drifting
control, they struggle with the significant simulation-to-reality gap, as
policies that perform well in simulation often fail when transferred to
physical systems. In this paper, we present a reinforcement learning framework
with GPU-accelerated parallel simulation and systematic domain randomization
that effectively bridges the gap. The proposed approach is validated on both
simulation and a custom-designed and open-sourced 1/10 scale Individual Wheel
Drive (IWD) RC car platform featuring independent wheel speed control.
Experiments across various scenarios from steady-state circular drifting to
direction transitions and variable-curvature path following demonstrate that
our approach achieves precise trajectory tracking while maintaining controlled
sideslip angles throughout complex maneuvers in both simulated and real-world
environments.

Abstract: There is a growing demand for autonomous mobile robots capable of navigating
unstructured agricultural environments. Tasks such as weed control in meadows
require efficient path planning through an unordered set of coordinates while
minimizing travel distance and adhering to curvature constraints to prevent
soil damage and protect vegetation. This paper presents an integrated
navigation framework combining a global path planner based on the Dubins
Traveling Salesman Problem (DTSP) with a Nonlinear Model Predictive Control
(NMPC) strategy for local path planning and control. The DTSP generates a
minimum-length, curvature-constrained path that efficiently visits all targets,
while the NMPC leverages this path to compute control signals to accurately
reach each waypoint. The system's performance was validated through comparative
simulation analysis on real-world field datasets, demonstrating that the
coupled DTSP-based planner produced smoother and shorter paths, with a
reduction of about 16% in the provided scenario, compared to decoupled methods.
Based thereon, the NMPC controller effectively steered the robot to the desired
waypoints, while locally optimizing the trajectory and ensuring adherence to
constraints. These findings demonstrate the potential of the proposed framework
for efficient autonomous navigation in agricultural environments.

Conclusion: 该方法为缩小仿真到现实差距提供了一种轻量级且可复现的框架，适用于低成本机器人硬件。

Abstract: Simulation-to-real transfer using domain randomization for robot control
often relies on low-gear-ratio, backdrivable actuators, but these approaches
break down when the sim-to-real gap widens. Inspired by the traditional PID
controller, we reinterpret its gains as surrogates for complex, unmodeled plant
dynamics. We then introduce a physics-guided gain regularization scheme that
measures a robot's effective proportional gains via simple real-world
experiments. Then, we penalize any deviation of a neural controller's local
input-output sensitivities from these values during training. To avoid the
overly conservative bias of naive domain randomization, we also condition the
controller on the current plant parameters. On an off-the-shelf two-wheeled
balancing robot with a 110:1 gearbox, our gain-regularized,
parameter-conditioned RNN achieves angular settling times in hardware that
closely match simulation. At the same time, a purely domain-randomized policy
exhibits persistent oscillations and a substantial sim-to-real gap. These
results demonstrate a lightweight, reproducible framework for closing
sim-to-real gaps on affordable robotic hardware.

Abstract: Imitation learning for robotic manipulation faces a fundamental challenge:
the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality robot demonstration data. Recent
robotic foundation models often pre-train on cross-embodiment robot datasets to
increase data scale, while they face significant limitations as the diverse
morphologies and action spaces across different robot embodiments make unified
training challenging. In this paper, we present H-RDT (Human to Robotics
Diffusion Transformer), a novel approach that leverages human manipulation data
to enhance robot manipulation capabilities. Our key insight is that large-scale
egocentric human manipulation videos with paired 3D hand pose annotations
provide rich behavioral priors that capture natural manipulation strategies and
can benefit robotic policy learning. We introduce a two-stage training
paradigm: (1) pre-training on large-scale egocentric human manipulation data,
and (2) cross-embodiment fine-tuning on robot-specific data with modular action
encoders and decoders. Built on a diffusion transformer architecture with 2B
parameters, H-RDT uses flow matching to model complex action distributions.
Extensive evaluations encompassing both simulation and real-world experiments,
single-task and multitask scenarios, as well as few-shot learning and
robustness assessments, demonstrate that H-RDT outperforms training from
scratch and existing state-of-the-art methods, including Pi0 and RDT, achieving
significant improvements of 13.9% and 40.5% over training from scratch in
simulation and real-world experiments, respectively. The results validate our
core hypothesis that human manipulation data can serve as a powerful foundation
for learning bimanual robotic manipulation policies.

Abstract: Autonomous driving systems face significant challenges in achieving
human-like adaptability, robustness, and interpretability in complex,
open-world environments. These challenges stem from fragmented architectures,
limited generalization to novel scenarios, and insufficient semantic extraction
from perception. To address these limitations, we propose a unified
Perception-Language-Action (PLA) framework that integrates multi-sensor fusion
(cameras, LiDAR, radar) with a large language model (LLM)-augmented
Vision-Language-Action (VLA) architecture, specifically a GPT-4.1-powered
reasoning core. This framework unifies low-level sensory processing with
high-level contextual reasoning, tightly coupling perception with natural
language-based semantic understanding and decision-making to enable
context-aware, explainable, and safety-bounded autonomous driving. Evaluations
on an urban intersection scenario with a construction zone demonstrate superior
performance in trajectory tracking, speed prediction, and adaptive planning.
The results highlight the potential of language-augmented cognitive frameworks
for advancing the safety, interpretability, and scalability of autonomous
driving systems.

Conclusion: 提出的多模态方法能更全面地捕捉用户体验的时空动态，为人机交互的适应性提供了有效工具。

Abstract: In recent years, the demand for social robots has grown, requiring them to
adapt their behaviors based on users' states. Accurately assessing user
experience (UX) in human-robot interaction (HRI) is crucial for achieving this
adaptability. UX is a multi-faceted measure encompassing aspects such as
sentiment and engagement, yet existing methods often focus on these
individually. This study proposes a UX estimation method for HRI by leveraging
multimodal social signals. We construct a UX dataset and develop a
Transformer-based model that utilizes facial expressions and voice for
estimation. Unlike conventional models that rely on momentary observations, our
approach captures both short- and long-term interaction patterns using a
multi-instance learning framework. This enables the model to capture temporal
dynamics in UX, providing a more holistic representation. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method outperforms third-party human evaluators in UX
estimation.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models have sparked interest in their
potential for robotic task planning. While these models demonstrate strong
generative capabilities, their effectiveness in producing structured and
executable plans remains uncertain. This paper presents a systematic evaluation
of a broad spectrum of current state of the art language models, each directly
prompted using Planning Domain Definition Language domain and problem files,
and compares their planning performance with the Fast Downward planner across a
variety of benchmarks. In addition to measuring success rates, we assess how
faithfully the generated plans translate into sequences of actions that can
actually be executed, identifying both strengths and limitations of using these
models in this setting. Our findings show that while the models perform well on
simpler planning tasks, they continue to struggle with more complex scenarios
that require precise resource management, consistent state tracking, and strict
constraint compliance. These results underscore fundamental challenges in
applying language models to robotic planning in real world environments. By
outlining the gaps that emerge during execution, we aim to guide future
research toward combined approaches that integrate language models with
classical planners in order to enhance the reliability and scalability of
planning in autonomous robotics.

Abstract: Hand exoskeletons are critical tools for dexterous teleoperation and
immersive manipulation interfaces, but achieving accurate hand tracking remains
a challenge due to user-specific anatomical variability and donning
inconsistencies. These issues lead to kinematic misalignments that degrade
tracking performance and limit applicability in precision tasks. We propose a
subject-specific calibration framework for exoskeleton-based hand tracking that
uses redundant joint sensing and a residual-weighted optimization strategy to
estimate virtual link parameters. Implemented on the Maestro exoskeleton, our
method improves joint angle and fingertip position estimation across users with
varying hand geometries. We introduce a data-driven approach to empirically
tune cost function weights using motion capture ground truth, enabling more
accurate and consistent calibration across participants. Quantitative results
from seven subjects show substantial reductions in joint and fingertip tracking
errors compared to uncalibrated and evenly weighted models. Qualitative
visualizations using a Unity-based virtual hand further confirm improvements in
motion fidelity. The proposed framework generalizes across exoskeleton designs
with closed-loop kinematics and minimal sensing, and lays the foundation for
high-fidelity teleoperation and learning-from-demonstration applications.

Abstract: LiDAR-based localization serves as a critical component in autonomous
systems, yet existing approaches face persistent challenges in balancing
repeatability, accuracy, and environmental adaptability. Traditional point
cloud registration methods relying solely on offline maps often exhibit limited
robustness against long-term environmental changes, leading to localization
drift and reliability degradation in dynamic real-world scenarios. To address
these challenges, this paper proposes DuLoc, a robust and accurate localization
method that tightly couples LiDAR-inertial odometry with offline map-based
localization, incorporating a constant-velocity motion model to mitigate
outlier noise in real-world scenarios. Specifically, we develop a LiDAR-based
localization framework that seamlessly integrates a prior global map with
dynamic real-time local maps, enabling robust localization in unbounded and
changing environments. Extensive real-world experiments in ultra unbounded port
that involve 2,856 hours of operational data across 32 Intelligent Guided

demonstrate that our system outperforms other state-of-the-art LiDAR
localization systems in large-scale changing outdoor environments.

approach improves both how latent actions are learned and how they are
incorporated into VLA pre-training. Together, these contributions enable
villa-X to achieve superior performance across simulated environments including
SIMPLER and LIBERO, as well as on two real-world robot setups including gripper
and dexterous hand manipulation. We believe the ViLLA paradigm holds
significant promise, and that our villa-X provides a strong foundation for
future research.

Abstract: While Reinforcement Learning (RL) has achieved remarkable success in language
modeling, its triumph hasn't yet fully translated to visuomotor agents. A
primary challenge in RL models is their tendency to overfit specific tasks or
environments, thereby hindering the acquisition of generalizable behaviors
across diverse settings. This paper provides a preliminary answer to this
challenge by demonstrating that RL-finetuned visuomotor agents in Minecraft can
achieve zero-shot generalization to unseen worlds. Specifically, we explore
RL's potential to enhance generalizable spatial reasoning and interaction
capabilities in 3D worlds. To address challenges in multi-task RL
representation, we analyze and establish cross-view goal specification as a
unified multi-task goal space for visuomotor policies. Furthermore, to overcome
the significant bottleneck of manual task design, we propose automated task
synthesis within the highly customizable Minecraft environment for large-scale
multi-task RL training, and we construct an efficient distributed RL framework
to support this. Experimental results show RL significantly boosts interaction
success rates by $4\times$ and enables zero-shot generalization of spatial
reasoning across diverse environments, including real-world settings. Our
findings underscore the immense potential of RL training in 3D simulated
environments, especially those amenable to large-scale task generation, for
significantly advancing visuomotor agents' spatial reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 蟑螂通过触角获取丰富的触觉信息，而现有传感器技术难以在微型机器人上实现类似功能。

Method: 开发了CITRAS，一种多段柔性层压传感器，内置电容角度传感器，轻巧且低功耗。

Result: CITRAS在静态和动态弯曲时的角度测量误差分别为0.79度和3.58度，并能预测距离、估算间隙宽度和区分纹理。

Conclusion: CITRAS为微型机器人提供了多功能触觉感知能力，有望提升其在复杂环境中的自主探索和避障能力。

Abstract: The American cockroach (Periplaneta americana) uses its soft antennae to
guide decision making by extracting rich tactile information from tens of
thousands of distributed mechanosensors. Although tactile sensors enable
robust, autonomous perception and navigation in natural systems, replicating
these capabilities in insect-scale robots remains challenging due to stringent
size, weight, and power constraints that limit existing sensor technologies. To
overcome these limitations, we introduce CITRAS (Cockroach Inspired Tactile
Robotic Antenna Sensor), a bioinspired, multi-segmented, compliant laminate
sensor with embedded capacitive angle sensors. CITRAS is compact (73.7x15.6x2.1
mm), lightweight (491 mg), and low-power (32 mW), enabling seamless integration
with miniature robotic platforms. The segmented compliant structure passively
bends in response to environmental stimuli, achieving accurate hinge angle
measurements with maximum errors of just 0.79 degree (quasistatic bending) and
3.58 degree (dynamic bending). Experimental evaluations demonstrate CITRAS'
multifunctional tactile perception capabilities: predicting base-to-tip
distances with 7.75 % error, estimating environmental gap widths with 6.73 %
error, and distinguishing surface textures through differential sensor
response. The future integration of this bioinspired tactile antenna in
insect-scale robots addresses critical sensing gaps, promising enhanced
autonomous exploration, obstacle avoidance, and environmental mapping in
complex, confined environments.

Motivation: 脑老化合成在临床和计算神经科学中有广泛应用，但高维数据、细微结构变化和个体特异性模式是主要挑战。

Method: NeuroAR利用生成自回归变换器，通过拼接先前和未来扫描的标记嵌入空间，并结合交叉注意力机制生成老化脑图像。

Result: NeuroAR在老年和青少年群体中均表现出色，图像保真度优于潜在扩散模型和生成对抗网络。

Conclusion: NeuroAR能够高保真地模拟个体特异性脑老化轨迹，显著优于现有模型。

Abstract: Brain aging synthesis is a critical task with broad applications in clinical
and computational neuroscience. The ability to predict the future structural
evolution of a subject's brain from an earlier MRI scan provides valuable
insights into aging trajectories. Yet, the high-dimensionality of data, subtle
changes of structure across ages, and subject-specific patterns constitute
challenges in the synthesis of the aging brain. To overcome these challenges,
we propose NeuroAR, a novel brain aging simulation model based on generative
autoregressive transformers. NeuroAR synthesizes the aging brain by
autoregressively estimating the discrete token maps of a future scan from a
convenient space of concatenated token embeddings of a previous and future
scan. To guide the generation, it concatenates into each scale the subject's
previous scan, and uses its acquisition age and the target age at each block
via cross-attention. We evaluate our approach on both the elderly population
and adolescent subjects, demonstrating superior performance over
state-of-the-art generative models, including latent diffusion models (LDM) and
generative adversarial networks, in terms of image fidelity. Furthermore, we
employ a pre-trained age predictor to further validate the consistency and
realism of the synthesized images with respect to expected aging patterns.
NeuroAR significantly outperforms key models, including LDM, demonstrating its
ability to model subject-specific brain aging trajectories with high fidelity.

Abstract: This paper presents a keystroke-based framework for detecting LLM-assisted
cheating in Korean, addressing key gaps in prior research regarding language
coverage, cognitive context, and the granularity of LLM involvement. Our
proposed dataset includes 69 participants who completed writing tasks under
three conditions: Bona fide writing, paraphrasing ChatGPT responses, and
transcribing ChatGPT responses. Each task spans six cognitive processes defined
in Bloom's Taxonomy (remember, understand, apply, analyze, evaluate, and
create). We extract interpretable temporal and rhythmic features and evaluate
multiple classifiers under both Cognition-Aware and Cognition-Unaware settings.
Temporal features perform well under Cognition-Aware evaluation scenarios,
while rhythmic features generalize better under cross-cognition scenarios.
Moreover, detecting bona fide and transcribed responses was easier than
paraphrased ones for both the proposed models and human evaluators, with the
models significantly outperforming the humans. Our findings affirm that
keystroke dynamics facilitate reliable detection of LLM-assisted writing across
varying cognitive demands and writing strategies, including paraphrasing and
transcribing LLM-generated responses.

Conclusion: 论文指出了KANs在计算效率、理论保证等方面的挑战，并提出了未来研究方向，以提升其鲁棒性和可扩展性。

Abstract: The field of scientific machine learning, which originally utilized
multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), is increasingly adopting Kolmogorov-Arnold
Networks (KANs) for data encoding. This shift is driven by the limitations of
MLPs, including poor interpretability, fixed activation functions, and
difficulty capturing localized or high-frequency features. KANs address these
issues with enhanced interpretability and flexibility, enabling more efficient
modeling of complex nonlinear interactions and effectively overcoming the
constraints associated with conventional MLP architectures. This review
categorizes recent progress in KAN-based models across three distinct
perspectives: (i) data-driven learning, (ii) physics-informed modeling, and
(iii) deep operator learning. Each perspective is examined through the lens of
architectural design, training strategies, application efficacy, and
comparative evaluation against MLP-based counterparts. By benchmarking KANs
against MLPs, we highlight consistent improvements in accuracy, convergence,
and spectral representation, clarifying KANs' advantages in capturing complex
dynamics while learning more effectively. Finally, this review identifies
critical challenges and open research questions in KAN development,
particularly regarding computational efficiency, theoretical guarantees,
hyperparameter tuning, and algorithm complexity. We also outline future
research directions aimed at improving the robustness, scalability, and
physical consistency of KAN-based frameworks.

Conclusion: 该研究提升了多灾害预警系统的可解释性和实用性，支持农业气候风险管理。

Abstract: Climate extremes present escalating risks to agriculture intensifying the
need for reliable multi-hazard early warning systems (EWS). The situation is
evolving due to climate change and hence such systems should have the
intelligent to continue to learn from recent climate behaviours. However,
traditional single-hazard forecasting methods fall short in capturing complex
interactions among concurrent climatic events. To address this deficiency, in
this paper, we combine sequential deep learning models and advanced Explainable
Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques to introduce a multi-hazard
forecasting framework for agriculture. In our experiments, we utilize
meteorological data from four prominent agricultural regions in the United
States (between 2010 and 2023) to validate the predictive accuracy of our
framework on multiple severe event types, which are extreme cold, floods,
frost, hail, heatwaves, and heavy rainfall, with tailored models for each area.
The framework uniquely integrates attention mechanisms with TimeSHAP (a
recurrent XAI explainer for time series) to provide comprehensive temporal
explanations revealing not only which climatic features are influential but
precisely when their impacts occur. Our results demonstrate strong predictive
accuracy, particularly with the BiLSTM architecture, and highlight the system's
capacity to inform nuanced, proactive risk management strategies. This research
significantly advances the explainability and applicability of multi-hazard
EWS, fostering interdisciplinary trust and effective decision-making process
for climate risk management in the agricultural industry.

Motivation: 心血管疾病每年导致全球1700多万人死亡，亟需隐私保护的预测系统。

Method: 提出FedCVD++框架，包括树子集采样、XGBoost特征提取和联邦SMOTE同步，以解决通信开销和类别不平衡问题。

Result: 在Framingham数据集上，FedCVD++的F1分数优于集中式方法，通信开销减少3.2倍，同时保持95%的准确率。

Conclusion: FedCVD++首次将非参数化模型集成到联邦医疗系统中，提供了隐私保护的解决方案，并在实际临床约束下验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) cause over 17 million deaths annually
worldwide, highlighting the urgent need for privacy-preserving predictive
systems. We introduce FedCVD++, an enhanced federated learning (FL) framework
that integrates both parametric models (logistic regression, SVM, neural
networks) and non-parametric models (Random Forest, XGBoost) for coronary heart
disease risk prediction. To address key FL challenges, we propose: (1)
tree-subset sampling that reduces Random Forest communication overhead by 70%,
(2) XGBoost-based feature extraction enabling lightweight federated ensembles,
and (3) federated SMOTE synchronization for resolving cross-institutional class
imbalance.
  Evaluated on the Framingham dataset (4,238 records), FedCVD++ achieves
state-of-the-art results: federated XGBoost (F1 = 0.80) surpasses its
centralized counterpart (F1 = 0.78), and federated Random Forest (F1 = 0.81)
matches non-federated performance. Additionally, our communication-efficient
strategies reduce bandwidth consumption by 3.2X while preserving 95% accuracy.
  Compared to existing FL frameworks, FedCVD++ delivers up to 15% higher
F1-scores and superior scalability for multi-institutional deployment. This
work represents the first practical integration of non-parametric models into
federated healthcare systems, providing a privacy-preserving solution validated
under real-world clinical constraints.

Method: 提出GSM-UTCI框架，融合地表形态、土地覆盖和气象数据，采用FiLM架构动态调整空间特征。

Result: 模型R2为0.9151，MAE为0.41°C，计算时间从小时级降至分钟级；应用于费城绿化场景显示显著降温效果。

Conclusion: GSM-UTCI为城市气候适应提供高效、精细化的决策工具，支持多样化绿化策略评估。

Abstract: As extreme heat events intensify due to climate change and urbanization,
cities face increasing challenges in mitigating outdoor heat stress. While
traditional physical models such as SOLWEIG and ENVI-met provide detailed
assessments of human-perceived heat exposure, their computational demands limit
scalability for city-wide planning. In this study, we propose GSM-UTCI, a
multimodal deep learning framework designed to predict daytime average
Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI) at 1-meter hyperlocal resolution. The
model fuses surface morphology (nDSM), high-resolution land cover data, and
hourly meteorological conditions using a feature-wise linear modulation (FiLM)
architecture that dynamically conditions spatial features on atmospheric
context. Trained on SOLWEIG-derived UTCI maps, GSM-UTCI achieves near-physical
accuracy, with an R2 of 0.9151 and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.41{\deg}C,
while reducing inference time from hours to under five minutes for an entire
city. To demonstrate its planning relevance, we apply GSM-UTCI to simulate
systematic landscape transformation scenarios in Philadelphia, replacing bare
earth, grass, and impervious surfaces with tree canopy. Results show spatially
heterogeneous but consistently strong cooling effects, with impervious-to-tree
conversion producing the highest aggregated benefit (-4.18{\deg}C average
change in UTCI across 270.7 km2). Tract-level bivariate analysis further
reveals strong alignment between thermal reduction potential and land cover
proportions. These findings underscore the utility of GSM-UTCI as a scalable,
fine-grained decision support tool for urban climate adaptation, enabling
scenario-based evaluation of greening strategies across diverse urban
environments.

Conclusion: 呼吁停止使用人类测试评估AI，转而开发基于理论和实证的AI专用测试框架。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable results on a range of
standardized tests originally designed to assess human cognitive and
psychological traits, such as intelligence and personality. While these results
are often interpreted as strong evidence of human-like characteristics in LLMs,
this paper argues that such interpretations constitute an ontological error.
Human psychological and educational tests are theory-driven measurement
instruments, calibrated to a specific human population. Applying these tests to
non-human subjects without empirical validation, risks mischaracterizing what
is being measured. Furthermore, a growing trend frames AI performance on
benchmarks as measurements of traits such as ``intelligence'', despite known
issues with validity, data contamination, cultural bias and sensitivity to
superficial prompt changes. We argue that interpreting benchmark performance as
measurements of human-like traits, lacks sufficient theoretical and empirical
justification. This leads to our position: Stop Evaluating AI with Human Tests,
Develop Principled, AI-specific Tests instead. We call for the development of
principled, AI-specific evaluation frameworks tailored to AI systems. Such
frameworks might build on existing frameworks for constructing and validating
psychometrics tests, or could be created entirely from scratch to fit the
unique context of AI.

Abstract: This paper investigates the inverse capabilities and broader utility of
multimodal latent spaces within task-specific AI (Artificial Intelligence)
models. While these models excel at their designed forward tasks (e.g.,
text-to-image generation, audio-to-text transcription), their potential for
inverse mappings remains largely unexplored. We propose an optimization-based
framework to infer input characteristics from desired outputs, applying it
bidirectionally across Text-Image (BLIP, Flux.1-dev) and Text-Audio
(Whisper-Large-V3, Chatterbox-TTS) modalities.
  Our central hypothesis posits that while optimization can guide models
towards inverse tasks, their multimodal latent spaces will not consistently
support semantically meaningful and perceptually coherent inverse mappings.
Experimental results consistently validate this hypothesis. We demonstrate that
while optimization can force models to produce outputs that align textually
with targets (e.g., a text-to-image model generating an image that an image
captioning model describes correctly, or an ASR model transcribing optimized
audio accurately), the perceptual quality of these inversions is chaotic and
incoherent. Furthermore, when attempting to infer the original semantic input
from generative models, the reconstructed latent space embeddings frequently
lack semantic interpretability, aligning with nonsensical vocabulary tokens.
  These findings highlight a critical limitation. multimodal latent spaces,
primarily optimized for specific forward tasks, do not inherently possess the
structure required for robust and interpretable inverse mappings. Our work
underscores the need for further research into developing truly semantically
rich and invertible multimodal latent spaces.

Conclusion: KLLM有效解决了LLM推理中的量化问题，显著提升了性能和能效。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) inference poses significant challenges due to its
intensive memory and computation demands. Weight and activation quantization
(WAQ) offers a promising solution by reducing both memory footprint and
arithmetic complexity. However, two key challenges remain in the existing WAQ
designs. (1) Traditional WAQ designs rely on uniform integer-based quantization
for hardware efficiency, but this often results in significant accuracy
degradation at low precision. K-Means-based quantization, a non-uniform
quantization technique, achieves higher accuracy by matching the Gaussian-like
distributions of weights and activations in LLMs. However, its non-uniform
nature prevents direct execution on low-precision compute units, requiring
dequantization and floating-point matrix multiplications (MatMuls) during
inference. (2) Activation outliers further hinder effective low-precision WAQ.
Offline thresholding methods for outlier detection can lead to significant
model performance degradation, while existing online detection techniques
introduce substantial runtime overhead.
  To address the aforementioned challenges and fully unleash the potential of
WAQ with K-Means quantization for LLM inference, in this paper, we propose
KLLM, a hardware-software co-design framework. KLLM features an index-based
computation scheme for efficient execution of MatMuls and nonlinear operations
on K-Means-quantized data, which avoids most of the dequantization and
full-precision computations. Moreover, KLLM incorporates a novel outlier
detection engine, Orizuru, that efficiently identifies the top-$k$ largest and
smallest elements in the activation data stream during online inference.
  Extensive experiments show that, on average, KLLM achieves speedups of 9.67x,
7.03x and energy efficiency improvements of 229.50x, 150.21x compared to the
A100 GPU and Atom, respectively.

Conclusion: 基于行为的时间序列方法能更细致地理解个体行为对流程效率的影响。

Abstract: Understanding how actor behavior influences process outcomes is a critical
aspect of process mining. Traditional approaches often use aggregate and static
process data, overlooking the temporal and causal dynamics that arise from
individual actor behavior. This limits the ability to accurately capture the
complexity of real-world processes, where individual actor behavior and
interactions between actors significantly shape performance. In this work, we
address this gap by integrating actor behavior analysis with Granger causality
to identify correlating links in time series data. We apply this approach to
realworld event logs, constructing time series for actor interactions, i.e.
continuation, interruption, and handovers, and process outcomes. Using Group
Lasso for lag selection, we identify a small but consistently influential set
of lags that capture the majority of causal influence, revealing that actor
behavior has direct and measurable impacts on process performance, particularly
throughput time. These findings demonstrate the potential of actor-centric,
time series-based methods for uncovering the temporal dependencies that drive
process outcomes, offering a more nuanced understanding of how individual
behaviors impact overall process efficiency.

database who received vancomycin. Kidney injury was defined by KDIGO criteria
(creatinine rise >=0.3 mg/dL within 48h or >=50% within 7d). Features were
selected via SelectKBest (top 30) and Random Forest ranking (final 15). Six
algorithms were tested with 5-fold cross-validation. Interpretability was
evaluated using SHAP, Accumulated Local Effects (ALE), and Bayesian posterior
sampling.
  Results: Of 10,288 patients, 2,903 (28.2%) developed creatinine elevation.
CatBoost performed best (AUROC 0.818 [95% CI: 0.801-0.834], sensitivity 0.800,
specificity 0.681, negative predictive value 0.900). Key predictors were
phosphate, total bilirubin, magnesium, Charlson index, and APSIII. SHAP
confirmed phosphate as a major risk factor. ALE showed dose-response patterns.
Bayesian analysis estimated mean risk 60.5% (95% credible interval: 16.8-89.4%)
in high-risk cases.
  Conclusions: This machine learning model predicts vancomycin-associated
creatinine elevation from routine ICU data with strong accuracy and
interpretability, enabling early risk detection and supporting timely
interventions in critical care.

Motivation: 探讨如何在保护隐私的同时，在赌博机问题中有效识别超过阈值的臂。

Method: 使用伯努利差分隐私机制生成私有响应，提出固定预算和固定置信度两种设置下的算法。

Result: 算法提供强隐私保障，性能界限与理论下界匹配（至多相差多对数因子）。

Conclusion: 研究为隐私保护决策框架在赌博机问题中的应用提供了重要见解。

Abstract: This work investigates the impact of ensuring local differential privacy in
the thresholding bandit problem. We consider both the fixed budget and fixed
confidence settings. We propose methods that utilize private responses,
obtained through a Bernoulli-based differentially private mechanism, to
identify arms with expected rewards exceeding a predefined threshold. We show
that this procedure provides strong privacy guarantees and derive theoretical
performance bounds on the proposed algorithms. Additionally, we present general
lower bounds that characterize the additional loss incurred by any
differentially private mechanism, and show that the presented algorithms match
these lower bounds up to poly-logarithmic factors. Our results provide valuable
insights into privacy-preserving decision-making frameworks in bandit problems.

Motivation: 准确预测材料断裂对设计安全可靠的结构至关重要，但现有方法（如机器学习和物理模拟）存在数据狭窄、计算资源需求高或泛化能力不足的问题。

Method: 采用Transformer架构，结合多模态输入（结构化/非结构化网格和文本输入），支持跨模拟器和材料的断裂预测，并能通过少量样本微调。

Result: 模型在多种材料和加载条件下表现良好，能泛化到未见过的材料（如钛和混凝土），且数据需求显著低于传统机器学习。

Conclusion: 该模型为断裂预测提供了一种统一、可扩展的解决方案，优于传统的模拟器专用工作流程。

Abstract: Accurately predicting when and how materials fail is critical to designing
safe, reliable structures, mechanical systems, and engineered components that
operate under stress. Yet, fracture behavior remains difficult to model across
the diversity of materials, geometries, and loading conditions in real-world
applications. While machine learning (ML) methods show promise, most models are
trained on narrow datasets, lack robustness, and struggle to generalize.
Meanwhile, physics-based simulators offer high-fidelity predictions but are
fragmented across specialized methods and require substantial high-performance
computing resources to explore the input space. To address these limitations,
we present a data-driven foundation model for fracture prediction, a
transformer-based architecture that operates across simulators, a wide range of
materials (including plastic-bonded explosives, steel, aluminum, shale, and
tungsten), and diverse loading conditions. The model supports both structured
and unstructured meshes, combining them with large language model embeddings of
textual input decks specifying material properties, boundary conditions, and
solver settings. This multimodal input design enables flexible adaptation
across simulation scenarios without changes to the model architecture. The
trained model can be fine-tuned with minimal data on diverse downstream tasks,
including time-to-failure estimation, modeling fracture evolution, and adapting
to combined finite-discrete element method simulations. It also generalizes to
unseen materials such as titanium and concrete, requiring as few as a single
sample, dramatically reducing data needs compared to standard ML. Our results
show that fracture prediction can be unified under a single model architecture,
offering a scalable, extensible alternative to simulator-specific workflows.

Conclusion: 该研究为边缘设备选择和AI模型部署提供了实用指导，优化了性能和能耗的权衡。

Abstract: The proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoT) and its cutting-edge
AI-enabled applications (e.g., autonomous vehicles and smart industries)
combine two paradigms: data-driven systems and their deployment on the edge.
Usually, edge devices perform inferences to support latency-critical
applications. In addition to the performance of these resource-constrained edge
devices, their energy usage is a critical factor in adopting and deploying edge
applications. Examples of such devices include Raspberry Pi (RPi), Intel Neural
Compute Stick (INCS), NVIDIA Jetson nano (NJn), and Google Coral USB (GCU).
Despite their adoption in edge deployment for AI inferences, there is no study
on their performance and energy usage for informed decision-making on the
device and model selection to meet the demands of applications. This study
fills the gap by rigorously characterizing the performance of traditional,
neural networks, and large language models on the above-edge devices.
Specifically, we analyze trade-offs among model F1 score, inference time,
inference power, and memory usage. Hardware and framework optimization, along
with external parameter tuning of AI models, can balance between model
performance and resource usage to realize practical edge AI deployments.

Motivation: 现有深度生成模型难以处理加权图或忽略权重与拓扑的联合分布，而加权图在生物学、化学和社会科学中普遍存在。

Method: 扩展BiGG模型，开发了BiGG-E，利用稀疏性在O((n + m)log n)时间内生成加权图。

Result: 实验表明，BiGG-E能更好地捕捉加权图的分布，同时保持可扩展性和计算效率。

Conclusion: BiGG-E在加权图生成任务中表现出色，解决了现有模型的局限性。

Abstract: Weighted graphs are ubiquitous throughout biology, chemistry, and the social
sciences, motivating the development of generative models for abstract weighted
graph data using deep neural networks. However, most current deep generative
models are either designed for unweighted graphs and are not easily extended to
weighted topologies or incorporate edge weights without consideration of a
joint distribution with topology. Furthermore, learning a distribution over
weighted graphs must account for complex nonlocal dependencies between both the
edges of the graph and corresponding weights of each edge. We develop an
autoregressive model BiGG-E, a nontrivial extension of the BiGG model, that
learns a joint distribution over weighted graphs while still exploiting
sparsity to generate a weighted graph with $n$ nodes and $m$ edges in $O((n +
m)\log n)$ time. Simulation studies and experiments on a variety of benchmark
datasets demonstrate that BiGG-E best captures distributions over weighted
graphs while remaining scalable and computationally efficient.

Conclusion: FLOSS能有效应对数据缺失问题，提升联邦学习的性能。

Abstract: Previous work on data privacy in federated learning systems focuses on
privacy-preserving operations for data from users who have agreed to share
their data for training. However, modern data privacy agreements also empower
users to use the system while opting out of sharing their data as desired. When
combined with stragglers that arise from heterogeneous device capabilities, the
result is missing data from a variety of sources that introduces bias and
degrades model performance. In this paper, we present FLOSS, a system that
mitigates the impacts of such missing data on federated learning in the
presence of stragglers and user opt-out, and empirically demonstrate its
performance in simulations.

Abstract: Although prior work in computer vision has shown strong correlations between
in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) accuracies, such
relationships remain underexplored in audio-based models. In this study, we
investigate how training conditions and input features affect the robustness
and generalization abilities of spoken keyword classifiers under OOD
conditions. We benchmark several neural architectures across a variety of
evaluation sets. To quantify the impact of noise on generalization, we make use
of two metrics: Fairness (F), which measures overall accuracy gains compared to
a baseline model, and Robustness (R), which assesses the convergence between ID
and OOD performance. Our results suggest that noise-aware training improves
robustness in some configurations. These findings shed new light on the
benefits and limitations of noise-based augmentation for generalization in
speech models.

Conclusion: 通过遗憾度量可以有效识别和减少预测任意性，从而提升模型在实际应用中的安全性和可靠性。

Abstract: Many prediction tasks can admit multiple models that can perform almost
equally well. This phenomenon can can undermine interpretability and safety
when competing models assign conflicting predictions to individuals. In this
work, we study how arbitrariness can arise in probabilistic classification
tasks as a result of an effect that we call \emph{observational multiplicity}.
We discuss how this effect arises in a broad class of practical applications
where we learn a classifier to predict probabilities $p_i \in [0,1]$ but are
given a dataset of observations $y_i \in \{0,1\}$. We propose to evaluate the
arbitrariness of individual probability predictions through the lens of
\emph{regret}. We introduce a measure of regret for probabilistic
classification tasks, which measures how the predictions of a model could
change as a result of different training labels change. We present a
general-purpose method to estimate the regret in a probabilistic classification
task. We use our measure to show that regret is higher for certain groups in
the dataset and discuss potential applications of regret. We demonstrate how
estimating regret promote safety in real-world applications by abstention and
data collection.

Result: 在多种DEs上测试表明，该方法在精度上优于现有技术，且训练效率高。

Conclusion: 该工作使AI求解DEs在自然和工程领域真正可用。

Abstract: Many problems are governed by differential equations (DEs). Artificial
intelligence (AI) is a new path for solving DEs. However, data is very scarce
and existing AI solvers struggle with approximation of high frequency
components (AHFC). We propose an AI paradigm for solving diverse DEs, including
DE-ruled first-principles data generation methodology and scale-dilation
operator (SDO) AI solver. Using either prior knowledge or random fields, we
generate solutions and then substitute them into the DEs to derive the sources
and initial/boundary conditions through balancing DEs, thus producing
arbitrarily vast amount of, first-principles-consistent training datasets at
extremely low computational cost. We introduce a reversible SDO that leverages
the Fourier transform of the multiscale solutions to fix AHFC, and design a
spatiotemporally coupled, attention-based Transformer AI solver of DEs with
SDO. An upper bound on the Hessian condition number of the loss function is
proven to be proportional to the squared 2-norm of the solution gradient,
revealing that SDO yields a smoother loss landscape, consequently fixing AHFC
with efficient training. Extensive tests on diverse DEs demonstrate that our AI
paradigm achieves consistently superior accuracy over state-of-the-art methods.
This work makes AI solver of DEs to be truly usable in broad nature and
engineering fields.

Method: FuseTen采用生成架构，结合物理原理的监督策略，融合多源卫星数据，并利用注意力模块、归一化模块和PatchGAN判别器提升数据质量。

Result: 实验表明，FuseTen在定量指标和视觉保真度上分别平均提升了32.06%和31.42%，优于线性基线方法。

Conclusion: FuseTen是首个能以10米高分辨率生成每日LST数据的非线性方法，为地表温度研究提供了新工具。

Abstract: Urban heatwaves, droughts, and land degradation are pressing and growing
challenges in the context of climate change. A valuable approach to studying
them requires accurate spatio-temporal information on land surface conditions.
One of the most important variables for assessing and understanding these
phenomena is Land Surface Temperature (LST), which is derived from satellites
and provides essential information about the thermal state of the Earth's
surface. However, satellite platforms inherently face a trade-off between
spatial and temporal resolutions. To bridge this gap, we propose FuseTen, a
novel generative framework that produces daily LST observations at a fine 10 m
spatial resolution by fusing spatio-temporal observations derived from
Sentinel-2, Landsat 8, and Terra MODIS. FuseTen employs a generative
architecture trained using an averaging-based supervision strategy grounded in
physical principles. It incorporates attention and normalization modules within
the fusion process and uses a PatchGAN discriminator to enforce realism.
Experiments across multiple dates show that FuseTen outperforms linear
baselines, with an average 32.06% improvement in quantitative metrics and
31.42% in visual fidelity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
non-linear method to generate daily LST estimates at such fine spatial
resolution.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统有限差分方法在检测黑盒函数稀疏性时存在假阴性问题，导致梯度计算错误且难以诊断。

Method: 通过系统性地用NaN污染输入并观察输出，利用IEEE 754浮点数的NaN传播特性重建保守的稀疏模式。

Result: 在航空航天翼重模型中实现了1.52倍加速，并检测到传统方法遗漏的多个依赖关系。

Conclusion: 该方法利用IEEE 754标准，无需修改现有黑盒代码即可跨语言和数学库工作，显著提升了稀疏性检测的效率和可靠性。

Abstract: Sparsity detection in black-box functions enables significant computational
speedups in gradient-based optimization through Jacobian compression, but
existing finite-difference methods suffer from false negatives due to
coincidental zero gradients. These false negatives can silently corrupt
gradient calculations, leading to difficult-to-diagnose errors. We introduce
NaN-propagation, which exploits the universal contamination property of IEEE
754 Not-a-Number floating-point values to trace input-output dependencies
through floating-point numerical computations. By systematically contaminating
inputs with NaN and observing which outputs become NaN, the method reconstructs
conservative sparsity patterns that eliminate false negatives. We demonstrate
the approach on an aerospace wing weight model, achieving a 1.52x speedup while
detecting dozens of dependencies missed by conventional methods -- a
significant improvement since gradient computation is the bottleneck in many
optimization workflows. The technique leverages IEEE 754 compliance to work
across programming languages and math libraries without modifying existing
black-box codes. Advanced strategies including NaN payload encoding enable
faster-than-linear time complexity, improving upon existing black-box sparsity
detection methods. Practical algorithms are also proposed to mitigate
challenges from branching code execution common in engineering applications.

Conclusion: DocsRay为多模态文档理解提供了一种高效、无需训练的解决方案。

Abstract: Understanding complex multimodal documents remains challenging due to their
structural inconsistencies and limited training data availability. We introduce
\textit{DocsRay}, a training-free document understanding system that integrates
pseudo Table of Contents (TOC) generation with hierarchical Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG). Our approach leverages multimodal Large Language Models'
(LLMs) native capabilities to seamlessly process documents containing diverse
elements such as text, images, charts, and tables without requiring specialized
models or additional training. DocsRay's framework synergistically combines
three key techniques: (1) a semantic structuring module using prompt-based LLM
interactions to generate a hierarchical pseudo-TOC, (2) zero-shot multimodal
analysis that converts diverse document elements into unified, text-centric
representations using the inherent capabilities of multimodal LLMs, and (3) an
efficient two-stage hierarchical retrieval system that reduces retrieval
complexity from $O(N)$ to $O(S + k_1 \cdot N_s)$. Evaluated on documents
averaging 49.4 pages and 20,971 textual tokens, DocsRay reduced query latency
from 3.89 to 2.12 seconds, achieving a 45% efficiency improvement. On the
MMLongBench-Doc benchmark, DocsRay-Pro attains an accuracy of 64.7%,
substantially surpassing previous state-of-the-art results.

Conclusion: 研究揭示了内部低维幻觉信号与特定MLP子电路的关联，为检测和缓解幻觉提供了新证据，并发布了ContraTales基准数据集。

Abstract: Contextual hallucinations -- statements unsupported by given context --
remain a significant challenge in AI. We demonstrate a practical
interpretability insight: a generator-agnostic observer model detects
hallucinations via a single forward pass and a linear probe on its residual
stream. This probe isolates a single, transferable linear direction separating
hallucinated from faithful text, outperforming baselines by 5-27 points and
showing robust mid-layer performance across Gemma-2 models (2B to 27B).
Gradient-times-activation localises this signal to sparse, late-layer MLP
activity. Critically, manipulating this direction causally steers generator
hallucination rates, proving its actionability. Our results offer novel
evidence of internal, low-dimensional hallucination tracking linked to specific
MLP sub-circuits, exploitable for detection and mitigation. We release the
2000-example ContraTales benchmark for realistic assessment of such solutions.

Motivation: 离线强化学习避免了在线交互的高成本，但依赖人工设计的奖励函数。PLARE旨在通过VLM自动生成指导信号，解决这一瓶颈。

Method: PLARE通过VLM对视觉轨迹段进行偏好标注，基于语言任务描述，使用监督对比偏好学习目标直接训练策略。

Result: 在MetaWorld机器人任务中，PLARE性能达到或超越现有VLM奖励生成方法，并在真实机器人任务中验证了实用性。

Conclusion: PLARE提供了一种无需人工奖励设计的离线强化学习新方法，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) provides a powerful framework for
training robotic agents using pre-collected, suboptimal datasets, eliminating
the need for costly, time-consuming, and potentially hazardous online
interactions. This is particularly useful in safety-critical real-world
applications, where online data collection is expensive and impractical.
However, existing offline RL algorithms typically require reward labeled data,
which introduces an additional bottleneck: reward function design is itself
costly, labor-intensive, and requires significant domain expertise. In this
paper, we introduce PLARE, a novel approach that leverages large
vision-language models (VLMs) to provide guidance signals for agent training.
Instead of relying on manually designed reward functions, PLARE queries a VLM
for preference labels on pairs of visual trajectory segments based on a
language task description. The policy is then trained directly from these
preference labels using a supervised contrastive preference learning objective,
bypassing the need to learn explicit reward models. Through extensive
experiments on robotic manipulation tasks from the MetaWorld, PLARE achieves
performance on par with or surpassing existing state-of-the-art VLM-based
reward generation methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of
PLARE in real-world manipulation tasks with a physical robot, further
validating its practical applicability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于隐私问题日益突出，机器遗忘（让模型“忘记”特定训练数据）受到关注。传统基于影响的遗忘方法计算开销大，难以应用于大规模模型和频繁数据删除场景。

Method: 通过建立记忆（增量学习）与遗忘（机器遗忘）的理论联系，提出了一种高效的机器遗忘算法（IAU），避免了传统方法中耗时的Hessian矩阵计算。

Result: 实验表明，IAU在移除保证、遗忘效率和模型性能之间取得了优越的平衡，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: IAU算法通过增量学习视角解决了机器遗忘的高效性问题，为实际应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Due to growing privacy concerns, machine unlearning, which aims at enabling
machine learning models to ``forget" specific training data, has received
increasing attention. Among existing methods, influence-based unlearning has
emerged as a prominent approach due to its ability to estimate the impact of
individual training samples on model parameters without retraining. However,
this approach suffers from prohibitive computational overhead arising from the
necessity to compute the Hessian matrix and its inverse across all training
samples and parameters, rendering it impractical for large-scale models and
scenarios involving frequent data deletion requests. This highlights the
difficulty of forgetting. Inspired by cognitive science, which suggests that
memorizing is easier than forgetting, this paper establishes a theoretical link
between memorizing (incremental learning) and forgetting (unlearning). This
connection allows machine unlearning to be addressed from the perspective of
incremental learning. Unlike the time-consuming Hessian computations in
unlearning (forgetting), incremental learning (memorizing) typically relies on
more efficient gradient optimization, which supports the aforementioned
cognitive theory. Based on this connection, we introduce the Influence
Approximation Unlearning (IAU) algorithm for efficient machine unlearning from
the incremental perspective. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that
IAU achieves a superior balance among removal guarantee, unlearning efficiency,
and comparable model utility, while outperforming state-of-the-art methods
across diverse datasets and model architectures. Our code is available at

### [147] [DynaSwarm: Dynamically Graph Structure Selection for LLM-based Multi-agent System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23261)
*Hui Yi Leong,Yuqing Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DynaSwarm是一个动态多智能体系统框架，通过强化学习和动态图选择优化协作结构，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多智能体系统框架依赖静态协作图结构，限制了适应性和性能。

Method: 提出DynaSwarm框架，结合A2C强化学习机制和动态图选择器，通过参数高效微调优化结构。

Result: 在问答、数学推理和编程任务中，DynaSwarm优于现有单智能体和多智能体基线。

Conclusion: 样本感知的结构灵活性对多智能体系统设计至关重要。

Abstract: Current multi-agent systems (MAS) frameworks often rely on manually designed
and static collaboration graph structures, limiting adaptability and
performance. To address these limitations, we propose DynaSwarm, a dynamic
framework that enhances LLM-based MAS through two key innovations: (1) an
actor-critic reinforcement learning (A2C) mechanism to optimize graph
structures with improved stability over prior RL methods, and (2) a dynamic
graph selector that adaptively chooses the optimal graph structure for each
input sample via parameter-efficient LLM fine-tuning. DynaSwarm eliminates the
need for rigid, one-fits-all graph architectures, instead leveraging
sample-specific idiosyncrasies to dynamically route queries through specialized
agent networks. (c) We propose to fine-tune the demonstration retriever to
fully exploit the power of in-context learning (ICL). Extensive experiments on
question answering, mathematical reasoning, and coding tasks demonstrate that
DynaSwarm consistently outperforms state-of-the-art single-agent and MAS
baselines across multiple LLM backbones. Our findings highlight the importance
of sample-aware structural flexibility in LLM MAS designs.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种动态分析框架，用于量化深度学习训练中个体样本的隐私泄露动态，揭示了样本学习难度与隐私风险之间的相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解深度学习模型在训练过程中如何编码成员信息，以应对成员推理攻击（MIAs）对训练数据隐私的威胁。

Method: 通过跟踪FPR-TPR平面上个体样本的脆弱性，分析数据集复杂性、模型架构和优化器选择等因素对隐私泄露的影响。

Result: 发现样本的内在学习难度与其隐私风险密切相关，且高度脆弱样本的隐私风险在训练早期就已确定。

Conclusion: 研究为隐私感知的模型训练策略提供了理论基础，揭示了隐私风险在训练过程中的动态演变规律。

Abstract: Membership inference attacks (MIAs) pose a critical threat to the privacy of
training data in deep learning. Despite significant progress in attack
methodologies, our understanding of when and how models encode membership
information during training remains limited. This paper presents a dynamic
analytical framework for dissecting and quantifying privacy leakage dynamics at
the individual sample level. By tracking per-sample vulnerabilities on an
FPR-TPR plane throughout training, our framework systematically measures how
factors such as dataset complexity, model architecture, and optimizer choice
influence the rate and severity at which samples become vulnerable. Crucially,
we discover a robust correlation between a sample's intrinsic learning
difficulty, and find that the privacy risk of samples highly vulnerable in the
final trained model is largely determined early during training. Our results
thus provide a deeper understanding of how privacy risks dynamically emerge
during training, laying the groundwork for proactive, privacy-aware model
training strategies.

TL;DR: 介绍了一种用于序列建模的神经网络层API和库，支持逐层（如教师强制训练）和逐步（如自回归采样）执行。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 简化序列模型的创建，确保在流式和平行序列处理中的正确性，并提供易于使用的API。

Method: 通过定义层状态的显式表示和逐步更新方法，确保与无状态逐层调用结果一致。

Result: 实现了复杂模型的即时流式处理，减少了常见错误，并提供了可组合的API。

Conclusion: SequenceLayers提供了一种高效、正确且易于扩展的序列建模解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce a neural network layer API and library for sequence modeling,
designed for easy creation of sequence models that can be executed both
layer-by-layer (e.g., teacher-forced training) and step-by-step (e.g.,
autoregressive sampling). To achieve this, layers define an explicit
representation of their state over time (e.g., a Transformer KV cache, a
convolution buffer, an RNN hidden state), and a step method that evolves that
state, tested to give identical results to a stateless layer-wise invocation.
This and other aspects of the SequenceLayers contract enables complex models to
be immediately streamable, mitigates a wide range of common bugs arising in
both streaming and parallel sequence processing, and can be implemented in any
deep learning library. A composable and declarative API, along with a
comprehensive suite of layers and combinators, streamlines the construction of
production-scale models from simple streamable components while preserving
strong correctness guarantees. Our current implementations of SequenceLayers
(JAX, TensorFlow 2) are available at https://github.com/google/sequence-layers.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的可解释算法，用于预测超市购物中被遗忘的商品，并在真实数据集上表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有NBP方法仅关注预测未来购买，忽略了被遗忘商品的检测，且缺乏透明性。

Method: 提出了两种可解释性设计的新算法，用于识别被遗忘商品并提供直观解释。

Result: 在真实零售数据集上，新算法比现有NBP基线方法性能提升10-15%。

Conclusion: 论文填补了NBP领域中被遗忘商品预测的空白，并提供了可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurately identifying items forgotten during a supermarket visit and
providing clear, interpretable explanations for recommending them remains an
underexplored problem within the Next Basket Prediction (NBP) domain. Existing
NBP approaches typically only focus on forecasting future purchases, without
explicitly addressing the detection of unintentionally omitted items. This gap
is partly due to the scarcity of real-world datasets that allow for the
reliable estimation of forgotten items. Furthermore, most current NBP methods
rely on black-box models, which lack transparency and limit the ability to
justify recommendations to end users. In this paper, we formally introduce the
forgotten item prediction task and propose two novel interpretable-by-design
algorithms. These methods are tailored to identify forgotten items while
offering intuitive, human-understandable explanations. Experiments on a
real-world retail dataset show our algorithms outperform state-of-the-art NBP
baselines by 10-15% across multiple evaluation metrics.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于过程奖励模型（PRMs）的方法，通过内在信号驱动的生成过程评估机制，加速大型推理模型（LRMs）的强化学习训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法仅依赖结果奖励，反馈稀疏且优化效率低。

Method: 提出内在信号驱动的过程评估机制，将连续正确/错误步骤聚合为连贯的“思考”单元，并引入能力自适应奖励机制。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在1.5B和7B参数的LRMs上显著提高了问题解决准确率，且训练样本需求更少。

Conclusion: 结构化过程奖励能显著加速LRMs在数学推理任务中的优化。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have recently shown promise in solving complex
math problems when optimized with Reinforcement Learning (RL). But conventional
approaches rely on outcome-only rewards that provide sparse feedback, resulting
in inefficient optimization process. In this work, we investigate the function
of process reward models (PRMs) to accelerate the RL training for LRMs. We
propose a novel intrinsic signal-driven generative process evaluation mechanism
operating at the thought level to address major bottlenecks in RL-based
training. Specifically, instead of requiring PRMs to know how to solve
problems, our method uses intrinsic signals in solutions to judge stepwise
correctness and aggregate contiguous correct/incorrect steps into coherent
'thought' units. This structured, thought-level rewards enable more reliable
credit assignment by reducing ambiguity in step segmentation and alleviating
reward hacking. We further introduce a capability-adaptive reward mechanism
that dynamically balances exploration and exploitation based on the LRM's
current proficiency, guiding learning without stifling creative
trial-and-error. These innovations are integrated into a new off-policy RL
algorithm, TP-GRPO, which extends grouped proximal optimization with
process-based rewards and improves training efficiency. Experiments on 1.5B and
7B parameter LRMs demonstrate that our method achieves higher problem-solving
accuracy with significantly fewer training samples than outcome-only reward
baselines. The results validate that well-structured process rewards can
substantially accelerate LRM optimization in math reasoning tasks. Code is
available at https://github.com/cs-holder/tp_grpo.

### [152] [Scalable and Precise Patch Robustness Certification for Deep Learning Models with Top-k Predictions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23335)
*Qilin Zhou,Haipeng Wang,Zhengyuan Wei,W. K. Chan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Patch robustness certification is a method to defend against adversarial patch attacks with provable guarantees. Existing techniques struggle with top-k predictions due to vote inflation and combinatorial explosion. CostCert, a new defender, avoids these issues and outperforms PatchGuard.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing patch robustness certification techniques fail to precisely certify the true label within top-k predictions due to vote inflation and combinatorial explosion.

Method: CostCert verifies the true label within top-k predictions by checking if the attack budget is insufficient to exclude the true label, avoiding pairwise comparisons and combinatorial explosion.

Result: CostCert significantly outperforms PatchGuard, retaining up to 57.3% certified accuracy for large patches where PatchGuard fails.

Conclusion: CostCert provides a scalable and precise solution for certified recovery in top-k predictions, addressing limitations of existing methods.

Abstract: Patch robustness certification is an emerging verification approach for
defending against adversarial patch attacks with provable guarantees for deep
learning systems. Certified recovery techniques guarantee the prediction of the
sole true label of a certified sample. However, existing techniques, if
applicable to top-k predictions, commonly conduct pairwise comparisons on those
votes between labels, failing to certify the sole true label within the top k
prediction labels precisely due to the inflation on the number of votes
controlled by the attacker (i.e., attack budget); yet enumerating all
combinations of vote allocation suffers from the combinatorial explosion
problem. We propose CostCert, a novel, scalable, and precise voting-based
certified recovery defender. CostCert verifies the true label of a sample
within the top k predictions without pairwise comparisons and combinatorial
explosion through a novel design: whether the attack budget on the sample is
infeasible to cover the smallest total additional votes on top of the votes
uncontrollable by the attacker to exclude the true labels from the top k
prediction labels. Experiments show that CostCert significantly outperforms the
current state-of-the-art defender PatchGuard, such as retaining up to 57.3% in
certified accuracy when the patch size is 96, whereas PatchGuard has already
dropped to zero.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于可微分代理模拟的动态定价方法，用于优化共享单车系统的库存平衡，显著降低了损失并提高了收敛速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 共享单车系统中，时空变化的用户需求导致库存不平衡，增加了重新分配成本，因此需要通过动态定价管理用户需求。

Method: 开发了一种可微分代理模拟方法，用于快速设计动态定价策略，考虑了用户多样性和概率性选择。

Result: 与传统方法相比，该方法损失减少73%至78%，收敛速度提高100倍以上，并在大规模系统中验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 动态定价策略能自然诱导库存平衡，无需人工干预，且通过设置合适的初始条件可最小化折扣成本。

Abstract: Bike-sharing systems are emerging in various cities as a new ecofriendly
transportation system. In these systems, spatiotemporally varying user demands
lead to imbalanced inventory at bicycle stations, resulting in additional
relocation costs. Therefore, it is essential to manage user demand through
optimal dynamic pricing for the system. However, optimal pricing design for
such a system is challenging because the system involves users with diverse
backgrounds and their probabilistic choices. To address this problem, we
develop a differentiable agent-based simulation to rapidly design dynamic
pricing in bike-sharing systems, achieving balanced bicycle inventory despite
spatiotemporally heterogeneous trips and probabilistic user decisions. We first
validate our approach against conventional methods through numerical
experiments involving 25 bicycle stations and five time slots, yielding 100
parameters. Compared to the conventional methods, our approach obtains a more
accurate solution with a 73% to 78% reduction in loss while achieving more than
a 100-fold increase in convergence speed. We further validate our approach on a
large-scale urban bike-sharing system scenario involving 289 bicycle stations,
resulting in a total of 1156 parameters. Through simulations using the obtained
pricing policies, we confirm that these policies can naturally induce balanced
inventory without any manual relocation. Additionally, we find that the cost of
discounts to induce the balanced inventory can be minimized by setting
appropriate initial conditions.

Conclusion: 提出的因果解释方法提高了对概念漂移的理解和干预能力，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: In a world that constantly changes, it is crucial to understand how those
changes impact different systems, such as industrial manufacturing or critical
infrastructure. Explaining critical changes, referred to as concept drift in
the field of machine learning, is the first step towards enabling targeted
interventions to avoid or correct model failures, as well as malfunctions and
errors in the physical world. Therefore, in this work, we extend model-based
drift explanations towards causal explanations, which increases the
actionability of the provided explanations. We evaluate our explanation
strategy on a number of use cases, demonstrating the practical usefulness of
our framework, which isolates the causally relevant features impacted by
concept drift and, thus, allows for targeted intervention.

Conclusion: 蜂蜜矿物质元素能有效区分掺假蜂蜜，随机森林是检测蜂蜜掺假的理想方法。

Abstract: This paper aims to develop a Machine Learning (ML)-based system for detecting
honey adulteration utilizing honey mineral element profiles. The proposed
system comprises two phases: preprocessing and classification. The
preprocessing phase involves the treatment of missing-value attributes and
normalization. In the classifica-tion phase, we use three supervised ML models:
logistic regression, decision tree, and random forest, to dis-criminate between
authentic and adulterated honey. To evaluate the performance of the ML models,
we use a public dataset comprising measurements of mineral element content of
authentic honey, sugar syrups, and adul-terated honey. Experimental findings
show that mineral element content in honey provides robust discriminative
information for detecting honey adulteration. Results also demonstrate that the
random forest-based classifier outperforms other classifiers on this dataset,

Analysis (LDA) algorithm for extracting the most discriminating features. In
the third phase, we use the K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) model to classify coconut
milk samples into authentic or adulterated. We evaluate the performance of the
proposed system using a public dataset comprising Fourier Transform Infrared

Result: 在多个PDE基准测试中表现优于其他方法，参数更少，且在部分可观测条件下性能提升。

Conclusion: 时空分解的算子学习方法高效且泛化性强，为PDE建模提供了坚实的理论基础。

Abstract: We propose the Spatiotemporal State Space Neural Operator (ST-SSM), a compact
architecture for learning solution operators of time-dependent partial
differential equations (PDEs). ST-SSM introduces a novel factorization of the
spatial and temporal dimensions, using structured state-space models to
independently model temporal evolution and spatial interactions. This design
enables parameter efficiency and flexible modeling of long-range spatiotemporal
dynamics. A theoretical connection is established between SSMs and neural
operators, and a unified universality theorem is proved for the resulting class
of architectures. Empirically, we demonstrate that our factorized formulation
outperforms alternative schemes such as zigzag scanning and parallel
independent processing on several PDE benchmarks, including 1D Burgers'
equation, 1D Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, and 2D Navier-Stokes equations
under varying physical conditions. Our model performs competitively with
existing baselines while using significantly fewer parameters. In addition, our
results reinforce previous findings on the benefits of temporal memory by
showing improved performance under partial observability. Our results highlight
the advantages of dimensionally factorized operator learning for efficient and
generalizable PDE modeling, and put this approach on a firm theoretical
footing.

Conclusion: Coflex为高效、可扩展的HW-NAS提供了可行方案，适用于边缘设备的DNN加速器开发。

Abstract: Hardware-Aware Neural Architecture Search (HW-NAS) is an efficient approach
to automatically co-optimizing neural network performance and hardware energy
efficiency, making it particularly useful for the development of Deep Neural
Network accelerators on the edge. However, the extensive search space and high
computational cost pose significant challenges to its practical adoption. To
address these limitations, we propose Coflex, a novel HW-NAS framework that
integrates the Sparse Gaussian Process (SGP) with multi-objective Bayesian
optimization. By leveraging sparse inducing points, Coflex reduces the GP
kernel complexity from cubic to near-linear with respect to the number of
training samples, without compromising optimization performance. This enables
scalable approximation of large-scale search space, substantially decreasing
computational overhead while preserving high predictive accuracy. We evaluate
the efficacy of Coflex across various benchmarks, focusing on
accelerator-specific architecture. Our experi- mental results show that Coflex
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of network accuracy and
Energy-Delay-Product, while achieving a computational speed-up ranging from
1.9x to 9.5x.

Abstract: Objective. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a highly prevalent
non-communicable chronic disease that substantially reduces life expectancy.
Accurate estimation of all-cause mortality risk in T2DM patients is crucial for
personalizing and optimizing treatment strategies. Research Design and Methods.
This study analyzed a cohort of 554 patients (aged 40-87 years) with diagnosed
T2DM over a maximum follow-up period of 16.8 years, during which 202 patients
(36%) died. Key survival-associated features were identified, and multiple
machine learning (ML) models were trained and validated to predict all-cause
mortality risk. To improve model interpretability, Shapley additive
explanations (SHAP) was applied to the best-performing model. Results. The
extra survival trees (EST) model, incorporating ten key features, demonstrated
the best predictive performance. The model achieved a C-statistic of 0.776,
with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) values of
0.86, 0.80, 0.841, and 0.826 for 5-, 10-, 15-, and 16.8-year all-cause
mortality predictions, respectively. The SHAP approach was employed to
interpret the model's individual decision-making processes. Conclusions. The
developed model exhibited strong predictive performance for mortality risk
assessment. Its clinically interpretable outputs enable potential bedside
application, improving the identification of high-risk patients and supporting
timely treatment optimization.

Method: 采用贝叶斯模型平均方法，分析双变量关系（X→Y vs. X←Y），并确定适用条件。

Result: 模型平均在结构不确定性中等至高、因果效应差异显著且损失函数敏感时有效。模拟显示现代因果发现方法可量化不确定性。

Conclusion: 框架补充了现有稳健因果推断方法，解决了实践中常被忽视的不确定性来源。

Abstract: Practitioners making decisions based on causal effects typically ignore
structural uncertainty. We analyze when this uncertainty is consequential
enough to warrant methodological solutions (Bayesian model averaging over
competing causal structures). Focusing on bivariate relationships ($X
\rightarrow Y$ vs. $X \leftarrow Y$), we establish that model averaging is
beneficial when: (1) structural uncertainty is moderate to high, (2) causal
effects differ substantially between structures, and (3) loss functions are
sufficiently sensitive to the size of the causal effect. We prove optimality
results of our suggested methodological solution under regularity conditions
and demonstrate through simulations that modern causal discovery methods can
provide, within limits, the necessary quantification. Our framework complements
existing robust causal inference approaches by addressing a distinct source of
uncertainty typically overlooked in practice.

Method: 提出DEA方法，通过两个可学习的方向参数动态结合Q值估计，利用基于Bellman误差的加权机制。

Result: 在连续控制基准测试中，DEA表现优于静态集成策略。

Conclusion: DEA通过数据驱动的方式自适应调整聚合策略，提升了强化学习的性能。

Abstract: Off-policy reinforcement learning in continuous control tasks depends
critically on accurate $Q$-value estimates. Conservative aggregation over
ensembles, such as taking the minimum, is commonly used to mitigate
overestimation bias. However, these static rules are coarse, discard valuable
information from the ensemble, and cannot adapt to task-specific needs or
different learning regimes. We propose Directional Ensemble Aggregation (DEA),
an aggregation method that adaptively combines $Q$-value estimates in
actor-critic frameworks. DEA introduces two fully learnable directional
parameters: one that modulates critic-side conservatism and another that guides
actor-side policy exploration. Both parameters are learned using ensemble
disagreement-weighted Bellman errors, which weight each sample solely by the
direction of its Bellman error. This directional learning mechanism allows DEA
to adjust conservatism and exploration in a data-driven way, adapting
aggregation to both uncertainty levels and the phase of training. We evaluate
DEA across continuous control benchmarks and learning regimes - from
interactive to sample-efficient - and demonstrate its effectiveness over static
ensemble strategies.

Method: 通过证明一个验证时间与证书长度关系的定理（Verifier Trade-off Theorem），并应用于复杂性类分离和自然问题。

Result: 证明了验证时间减少需要证书长度增加的定理，并展示了其在复杂性类分离和自然问题中的适用性。

Conclusion: 该研究为复杂性理论中的验证时间与证书长度关系提供了理论基础，并对P vs. NP问题提供了新的见解。

Abstract: We investigate the trade-off between certificate length and verifier runtime.
We prove a Verifier Trade-off Theorem showing that reducing the inherent
verification time of a language from \(f(n)\) to \(g(n)\), where \(f(n) \ge
g(n)\), requires certificates of length at least \(\Omega(\log(f(n) / g(n)))\).
This theorem induces a natural hierarchy based on certificate complexity. We
demonstrate its applicability to analyzing conjectured separations between
complexity classes (e.g., \(\np\) and \(\exptime\)) and to studying natural
problems such as string periodicity and rotation detection. Additionally, we
provide perspectives on the \(\p\) vs. \(\np\) problem by relating it to the
existence of sub-linear certificates.

TL;DR: 本文提出了固定裁剪阈值的DP-Clipped-SGD方法，首次在重尾噪声下实现了高概率收敛分析，适用于凸和非凸平滑优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有高概率收敛分析要求裁剪阈值随优化步数增加，这与标准差分隐私机制（如高斯机制）不兼容。

Method: 采用固定裁剪阈值的DP-Clipped-SGD方法，适用于重尾噪声（由有界中心α阶矩假设描述）。

Result: 方法以更快的速率收敛到最优解的邻域，且该邻域可与差分隐私引入的噪声平衡。

Conclusion: 固定裁剪阈值的DP-Clipped-SGD在收敛速度和隐私保证之间提供了更优的权衡。

Abstract: Gradient clipping is a fundamental tool in Deep Learning, improving the
high-probability convergence of stochastic first-order methods like SGD,
AdaGrad, and Adam under heavy-tailed noise, which is common in training large
language models. It is also a crucial component of Differential Privacy (DP)
mechanisms. However, existing high-probability convergence analyses typically
require the clipping threshold to increase with the number of optimization
steps, which is incompatible with standard DP mechanisms like the Gaussian
mechanism. In this work, we close this gap by providing the first
high-probability convergence analysis for DP-Clipped-SGD with a fixed clipping
level, applicable to both convex and non-convex smooth optimization under
heavy-tailed noise, characterized by a bounded central $\alpha$-th moment
assumption, $\alpha \in (1,2]$. Our results show that, with a fixed clipping
level, the method converges to a neighborhood of the optimal solution with a
faster rate than the existing ones. The neighborhood can be balanced against
the noise introduced by DP, providing a refined trade-off between convergence
speed and privacy guarantees.

Motivation: 解决持续学习中的灾难性遗忘问题，尤其是经验回放方法中稀疏样本分布导致的决策边界简化问题。

Method: 提出Experience Blending框架，包含两个核心组件：1）多变量差分隐私噪声机制生成SBD；2）端到端训练策略结合关键样本和SBD。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和Tiny ImageNet上，方法优于9个基线，准确率分别提升10%、6%和13%。

Conclusion: 合成边界数据的引入有效改善了决策边界的稳定性，显著减轻了灾难性遗忘。

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) aims to address catastrophic forgetting in models
trained sequentially on multiple tasks. While experience replay has shown
promise, its effectiveness is often limited by the sparse distribution of
stored key samples, leading to overly simplified decision boundaries. We
hypothesize that introducing synthetic data near the decision boundary
(Synthetic Boundary Data, or SBD) during training serves as an implicit
regularizer, improving boundary stability and mitigating forgetting. To
validate this hypothesis, we propose a novel training framework, {\bf
Experience Blending}, which integrates knowledge from both stored key samples
and synthetic, boundary-adjacent data. Experience blending consists of two core
components: (1) a multivariate Differential Privacy (DP) noise mechanism that
injects batch-wise noise into low-dimensional feature representations,
generating SBD; and (2) an end-to-end training strategy that jointly leverages
both stored key samples and SBD. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,
and Tiny ImageNet demonstrate that our method outperforms nine CL baselines,
achieving accuracy improvements of 10%, 6%, and 13%, respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 减少深度学习模型在边缘设备上的计算成本，探索PEFT方法在卷积架构中的应用。

Method: 在标准卷积和深度可分离卷积架构上评估LoRA、DoRA和GaLore等PEFT方法，并与传统微调方法比较性能和计算成本。

Result: PEFT方法在深度可分离卷积架构上的内存效率仅为大型语言模型的一半，但在边缘优化的卷积架构上可减少95%的FLOPs。

Conclusion: PEFT方法的选择需考虑硬件限制、性能需求和具体应用场景。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods reduce the computational costs
of updating deep learning models by minimizing the number of additional
parameters used to adapt a model to a down- stream task. While extensively
researched in large language models (LLMs), their application to smaller models
used on edge devices, such as convolutional neural networks, remains
underexplored. This paper benchmarks and analyzes popular PEFT methods on
convolutional architectures typically deployed in resource-constrained edge
environments. We evaluate LoRA, DoRA, and GaLore for updating standard and
depthwise convolutional architectures to handle distribution shifts and
accommodate unseen classes. We utilize recently proposed PyTorch profilers to
compare the updated model performance and computational costs of these PEFT
methods with traditional fine-tuning approaches. With resource efficiency in
mind, we investigate their update behavior across different rank dimensions. We
find that the evaluated PEFT methods are only half as memory-efficient when
applied to depthwise-separable convolution architectures, compared to their
efficiency with LLMs. Conversely, when targeting convolu- tional architectures
optimized for edge deployment, adapter-based PEFT methods can reduce floating
point operations (FLOPs) during model updates by up to 95%. These insights
offer valuable guidance for selecting PEFT methods based on hardware
constraints, performance requirements, and application needs. Our code is

Abstract: Motivated by the problem of fast processing of attention matrices, we study
fast algorithms for computing matrix-vector products for asymmetric Gaussian
Kernel matrices $K\in \mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$. $K$'s columns are indexed by a
set of $n$ keys $k_1,k_2\ldots, k_n\in \mathbb{R}^d$, rows by a set of $n$
queries $q_1,q_2,\ldots,q_n\in \mathbb{R}^d $, and its $i,j$ entry is $K_{ij} =
e^{-\|q_i-k_j\|_2^2/2\sigma^2}$ for some bandwidth parameter $\sigma>0$. Given
a vector $x\in \mathbb{R}^n$ and error parameter $\epsilon>0$, our task is to
output a $y\in \mathbb{R}^n$ such that $\|Kx-y\|_2\leq \epsilon \|x\|_2$ in
time subquadratic in $n$ and linear in $d$. Our algorithms rely on the
following modelling assumption about the matrices $K$: the sum of the entries
of $K$ scales linearly in $n$, as opposed to worst case quadratic growth. We
validate this assumption experimentally, for Gaussian kernel matrices
encountered in various settings such as fast attention computation in LLMs. We
obtain the first subquadratic-time algorithm that works under this assumption,
for unrestricted vectors.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) promise orders-of-magnitude lower power
consumption and low-latency inference on neuromorphic hardware for a wide range
of robotic tasks. In this work, we present an energy-efficient implementation
of a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm using quantized SNNs to solve two
classical control tasks. The network is trained using the Q-learning algorithm,
then fine-tuned and quantized to low-bit (8-bit) precision for embedded

advantage of SpiNNaker2 over conventional computing platforms, we analyze
inference latency, dynamic power consumption, and energy cost per inference for
our SNN models, comparing performance against a GTX 1650 GPU baseline. Our
results demonstrate SpiNNaker2's strong potential for scalable, low-energy
neuromorphic computing, achieving up to 32x reduction in energy consumption.
Inference latency remains on par with GPU-based execution, with improvements
observed in certain task settings, reinforcing SpiNNaker2's viability for
real-time neuromorphic control and making the neuromorphic approach a
compelling direction for efficient deep Q-learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We introduce SA-FDR, a novel algorithm for $\ell_0$-norm feature selection
that considers this task as a combinatorial optimisation problem and solves it
by using simulated annealing to perform a global search over the space of
feature subsets. The optimisation is guided by the Fisher discriminant ratio,
which we use as a computationally efficient proxy for model quality in
classification tasks. Our experiments, conducted on datasets with up to
hundreds of thousands of samples and hundreds of features, demonstrate that
SA-FDR consistently selects more compact feature subsets while achieving a high
predictive accuracy. This ability to recover informative yet minimal sets of
features stems from its capacity to capture inter-feature dependencies often
missed by greedy optimisation approaches. As a result, SA-FDR provides a
flexible and effective solution for designing interpretable models in
high-dimensional settings, particularly when model sparsity, interpretability,
and performance are crucial.

Conclusion: GraphRAG-R1显著提升了LLMs在多跳推理中的能力，具有广泛适用性和性能优势。

Abstract: Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) has shown great effectiveness
in enhancing the reasoning abilities of LLMs by leveraging graph structures for
knowledge representation and modeling complex real-world relationships.
However, existing GraphRAG methods still face significant bottlenecks when
handling complex problems that require multi-hop reasoning, as their query and
retrieval phases are largely based on pre-defined heuristics and do not fully
utilize the reasoning potentials of LLMs. To address this problem, we propose
GraphRAG-R1, an adaptive GraphRAG framework by training LLMs with
process-constrained outcome-based reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance the
multi-hop reasoning ability. Our method can decompose complex problems,
autonomously invoke retrieval tools to acquire necessary information, and
perform effective reasoning. Specifically, we utilize a modified version of
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) that supports rollout-with-thinking
capability. Next, we design two process-constrained reward functions. To handle
the shallow retrieval problem, we design a Progressive Retrieval Attenuation
(PRA) reward to encourage essential retrievals. Then, to handle the
over-thinking problem, we design Cost-Aware F1 (CAF) reward to balance the
model performance with computational costs. We further design a phase-dependent
training strategy, containing three training stages corresponding to cold start
and these two rewards. Lastly, our method adopts a hybrid graph-textual
retrieval to improve the reasoning capacity. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate that GraphRAG-R1 boosts LLM capabilities in solving complex
reasoning problems compared to state-of-the-art GraphRAG methods on both
in-domain and out-of-domain datasets. Furthermore, our framework can be
flexibly integrated with various existing retrieval methods, consistently
delivering performance improvements.

Conclusion: EB-gMCR结合高容量生成建模和硬组件选择，为大规模信号解混分析提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Signal unmixing analysis decomposes data into basic patterns and is widely
applied in chemical and biological research. Multivariate curve resolution
(MCR), a branch of signal unmixing, separates mixed chemical signals into base
patterns (components) and their concentrations, playing a key role in
understanding composition. Classical MCR is typically framed as matrix
factorization (MF) and requires a user-specified component count, usually
unknown in real data. As dataset size or component count increases, the
scalability and reliability of MF-based MCR face significant challenges. This
study reformulates MCR as a generative process (gMCR), and introduces an
energy-based deep learning solver, EB-gMCR, that automatically discovers the
smallest component set able to reconstruct the data faithfully. EB-gMCR starts
from a large candidate pool (e.g., 1024 spectra) and employs a differentiable
gating network to retain only active components while estimating their
concentrations. On noisy synthetic datasets containing up to 256 latent
sources, EB-gMCR maintained R^2 >= 0.98 and recovered the component count
within 5% of the ground truth; at lower noise it achieved R^2 >= 0.99 with near
exact component estimation. Additional chemical priors, such as non-negativity
or nonlinear mixing, enter as simple plug-in functions, enabling adaptation to
other instruments or domains without altering the core learning process. By
uniting high-capacity generative modeling and hard component selection, EB-gMCR
offers a practical route to large-scale signal unmixing analysis, including
chemical library-driven scenarios. The source code is available at

Abstract: Decentralized Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) methods allow for
learning scalable multi-agent policies, but suffer from partial observability
and induced non-stationarity. These challenges can be addressed by introducing
mechanisms that facilitate coordination and high-level planning. Specifically,
coordination and temporal abstraction can be achieved through communication
(e.g., message passing) and Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL)
approaches to decision-making. However, optimization issues limit the
applicability of hierarchical policies to multi-agent systems. As such, the
combination of these approaches has not been fully explored. To fill this void,
we propose a novel and effective methodology for learning multi-agent
hierarchies of message-passing policies. We adopt the feudal HRL framework and
rely on a hierarchical graph structure for planning and coordination among
agents. Agents at lower levels in the hierarchy receive goals from the upper
levels and exchange messages with neighboring agents at the same level. To
learn hierarchical multi-agent policies, we design a novel reward-assignment
method based on training the lower-level policies to maximize the advantage
function associated with the upper levels. Results on relevant benchmarks show
that our method performs favorably compared to the state of the art.

Abstract: Clinical trials are a systematic endeavor to assess the safety and efficacy
of new drugs or treatments. Conducting such trials typically demands
significant financial investment and meticulous planning, highlighting the need
for accurate predictions of trial outcomes. Accurately predicting patient
enrollment, a key factor in trial success, is one of the primary challenges
during the planning phase. In this work, we propose a novel deep learning-based
method to address this critical challenge. Our method, implemented as a neural
network model, leverages pre-trained language models (PLMs) to capture the
complexities and nuances of clinical documents, transforming them into
expressive representations. These representations are then combined with
encoded tabular features via an attention mechanism. To account for
uncertainties in enrollment prediction, we enhance the model with a
probabilistic layer based on the Gamma distribution, which enables range
estimation. We apply the proposed model to predict clinical trial duration,
assuming site-level enrollment follows a Poisson-Gamma process. We carry out
extensive experiments on real-world clinical trial data, and show that the
proposed method can effectively predict the number of patients enrolled at a
number of sites for a given clinical trial, outperforming established baseline
models.

Abstract: Data augmentation is gaining importance across various aspects of time series
analysis, from forecasting to classification and anomaly detection tasks. We
introduce the Latent Generative Transformer Augmentation (L-GTA) model, a
generative approach using a transformer-based variational recurrent
autoencoder. This model uses controlled transformations within the latent space
of the model to generate new time series that preserve the intrinsic properties
of the original dataset. L-GTA enables the application of diverse
transformations, ranging from simple jittering to magnitude warping, and
combining these basic transformations to generate more complex synthetic time
series datasets. Our evaluation of several real-world datasets demonstrates the
ability of L-GTA to produce more reliable, consistent, and controllable
augmented data. This translates into significant improvements in predictive
accuracy and similarity measures compared to direct transformation methods.

Result: 揭示了softmax注意力比线性注意力更具表达力的原因。

Conclusion: 通过RNN框架解释了softmax注意力的优越性，为未来注意力机制设计提供了理论支持。

Abstract: Since its introduction, softmax attention has become the backbone of modern
transformer architectures due to its expressiveness and scalability across a
wide range of tasks. However, the main drawback of softmax attention is the
quadratic memory requirement and computational complexity with respect to the
sequence length. By replacing the softmax nonlinearity, linear attention and
similar methods have been introduced to avoid the quadratic bottleneck of
softmax attention. Despite these linear forms of attention being derived from
the original softmax formulation, they typically lag in terms of downstream
accuracy. While strong intuition of the softmax nonlinearity on the query and
key inner product suggests that it has desirable properties compared to other
nonlinearities, the question of why this discrepancy exists still remains
unanswered. This work demonstrates that linear attention is an approximation of
softmax attention by deriving the recurrent form of softmax attention. Using
this form, each part of softmax attention can be described in the language of
recurrent neural networks (RNNs). Describing softmax attention as an RNN allows
for the ablation of the components of softmax attention to understand the
importance of each part and how they interact. In this way, our work helps
explain why softmax attention is more expressive than its counterparts.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across

OptiGradTrust, a comprehensive defense framework that evaluates gradient

reconstruction error, cosine similarity metrics, $L_2$ norm, sign-consistency

for adaptive trust scoring. To address convergence challenges under data
heterogeneity, we develop FedBN-Prox (FedBN-P), combining Federated Batch
Normalization with proximal regularization for optimal accuracy-convergence
trade-offs. Extensive evaluation across MNIST, CIFAR-10, and Alzheimer's MRI
datasets under various Byzantine attack scenarios demonstrates significant
improvements over state-of-the-art defenses, achieving up to +1.6 percentage

Abstract: Feature attribution methods such as SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) have
become instrumental in understanding machine learning models, but their role in
guiding model optimization remains underexplored. In this paper, we propose a
SHAP-guided regularization framework that incorporates feature importance
constraints into model training to enhance both predictive performance and
interpretability. Our approach applies entropy-based penalties to encourage
sparse, concentrated feature attributions while promoting stability across
samples. The framework is applicable to both regression and classification
tasks. Our first exploration started with investigating a tree-based model
regularization using TreeSHAP. Through extensive experiments on benchmark
regression and classification datasets, we demonstrate that our method improves
generalization performance while ensuring robust and interpretable feature
attributions. The proposed technique offers a novel, explainability-driven
regularization approach, making machine learning models both more accurate and

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM响应缓存中因个性化交互和语义搜索准确性不足导致的用户查询相关性保持问题。

Method: 采用轻量级LLM动态调整缓存响应，结合用户研究、满意度投票和多代理LLM辩论进行评估。

Result: TweakLLM在保持响应质量的同时显著提高缓存效率，适用于高流量LLM部署。

Conclusion: TweakLLM是一种可扩展且资源高效的缓存解决方案，不影响用户体验。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) process millions of queries daily, making
efficient response caching a compelling optimization for reducing cost and
latency. However, preserving relevance to user queries using this approach
proves difficult due to the personalized nature of chatbot interactions and the
limited accuracy of semantic similarity search. To address this, we present
TweakLLM, a novel routing architecture that employs a lightweight LLM to
dynamically adapt cached responses to incoming prompts. Through comprehensive
evaluation, including user studies with side-by-side comparisons, satisfaction
voting, as well as multi-agent LLM debates, we demonstrate that TweakLLM
maintains response quality comparable to frontier models while significantly
improving cache effectiveness. Our results across real-world datasets highlight
TweakLLM as a scalable, resource-efficient caching solution for high-volume LLM
deployments without compromising user experience.

*Tianyi Chen,Haitong Ma,Na Li,Kai Wang,Bo Dai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为FPMD的在线强化学习算法，通过1步采样提升扩散策略的推理速度，性能与扩散策略基线相当但计算量大幅减少。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散策略在在线强化学习中表现优异，但推理速度慢，限制了其响应性。

Method: 利用流匹配模型中单步采样的分布方差与离散化误差的理论联系，无需额外蒸馏或一致性训练，提出了基于流策略和MeanFlow策略的两种算法变体。

Result: 在MuJoCo基准测试中表现优异，推理时函数评估次数减少数百倍。

Conclusion: FPMD算法在保持高性能的同时显著提升了推理效率。

Abstract: Diffusion policies have achieved great success in online reinforcement
learning (RL) due to their strong expressive capacity. However, the inference
of diffusion policy models relies on a slow iterative sampling process, which
limits their responsiveness. To overcome this limitation, we propose Flow
Policy Mirror Descent (FPMD), an online RL algorithm that enables 1-step
sampling during policy inference. Our approach exploits a theoretical
connection between the distribution variance and the discretization error of
single-step sampling in straight interpolation flow matching models, and
requires no extra distillation or consistency training. We present two
algorithm variants based on flow policy and MeanFlow policy parametrizations,
respectively. Extensive empirical evaluations on MuJoCo benchmarks demonstrate
that our algorithms show strong performance comparable to diffusion policy
baselines while requiring hundreds of times fewer function evaluations during
inference.

*Rabeya Tus Sadia,Qiang Cheng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DepMicroDiff是一种新框架，结合扩散模型和依赖感知Transformer，显著提升微生物组数据插补性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微生物组数据的稀疏性和噪声问题阻碍了下游任务，现有方法未能充分捕捉微生物间的复杂依赖关系和上下文元数据。

Method: 结合扩散生成模型和依赖感知Transformer，利用VAE预训练和LLM编码患者元数据。

Result: 在TCGA数据集上表现优异，Pearson相关系数达0.712，余弦相似度达0.812，RMSE和MAE更低。

Conclusion: DepMicroDiff在微生物组数据插补中表现出鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Microbiome data analysis is essential for understanding host health and
disease, yet its inherent sparsity and noise pose major challenges for accurate
imputation, hindering downstream tasks such as biomarker discovery. Existing
imputation methods, including recent diffusion-based models, often fail to
capture the complex interdependencies between microbial taxa and overlook
contextual metadata that can inform imputation. We introduce DepMicroDiff, a
novel framework that combines diffusion-based generative modeling with a
Dependency-Aware Transformer (DAT) to explicitly capture both mutual pairwise
dependencies and autoregressive relationships. DepMicroDiff is further enhanced
by VAE-based pretraining across diverse cancer datasets and conditioning on
patient metadata encoded via a large language model (LLM). Experiments on TCGA
microbiome datasets show that DepMicroDiff substantially outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines, achieving higher Pearson correlation (up to 0.712),
cosine similarity (up to 0.812), and lower RMSE and MAE across multiple cancer
types, demonstrating its robustness and generalizability for microbiome
imputation.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了在少样本设置下如何利用异常样本训练二元异常分类模型，提出了一种结合零样本和基于记忆技术的多分数异常检测方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统异常检测方法依赖大量正常样本，但在少样本情况下异常样本的作用变得重要。本文旨在研究如何有效利用异常样本。

Method: 提出了一种结合零样本和基于记忆技术的多分数异常检测方法，并通过增强验证技术优化分数聚合。

Result: 在工业异常检测数据集上验证了方法的有效性，比较了异常样本与常规样本的效用。

Conclusion: 异常样本在少样本设置下对模型训练有显著作用，提出的方法在多分数聚合上表现优异。

Abstract: Several anomaly detection and classification methods rely on large amounts of
non-anomalous or "normal" samples under the assump- tion that anomalous data is
typically harder to acquire. This hypothesis becomes questionable in Few-Shot
settings, where as little as one anno- tated sample can make a significant
difference. In this paper, we tackle the question of utilizing anomalous
samples in training a model for bi- nary anomaly classification. We propose a
methodology that incorporates anomalous samples in a multi-score anomaly
detection score leveraging recent Zero-Shot and memory-based techniques. We
compare the utility of anomalous samples to that of regular samples and study
the benefits and limitations of each. In addition, we propose an
augmentation-based validation technique to optimize the aggregation of the
different anomaly scores and demonstrate its effectiveness on popular
industrial anomaly detection datasets.

*Diana Mortagua*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究提出了一种基于知识推荐系统的查询-标注者配对策略，考虑标注者的情绪和疲劳水平，以减少主动学习中的标注错误。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 主动学习中标注数据的成本和时间问题，以及现有方法未考虑标注者内部因素（如情绪和疲劳）的影响。

Method: 使用知识推荐系统（RS）结合标注者历史准确率、情绪和疲劳水平，选择最佳标注者。

Result: 考虑内部因素显著减少了标注错误和模型训练中的不确定性，提升了准确率和F1分数。

Conclusion: 研究探索了人类认知因素对主动学习的影响，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: This study centers on overcoming the challenge of selecting the best
annotators for each query in Active Learning (AL), with the objective of
minimizing misclassifications. AL recognizes the challenges related to cost and
time when acquiring labeled data, and decreases the number of labeled data
needed. Nevertheless, there is still the necessity to reduce annotation errors,
aiming to be as efficient as possible, to achieve the expected accuracy faster.
Most strategies for query-annotator pairs do not consider internal factors that
affect productivity, such as mood, attention, motivation, and fatigue levels.
This work addresses this gap in the existing literature, by not only
considering how the internal factors influence annotators (mood and fatigue
levels) but also presenting a new query-annotator pair strategy, using a
Knowledge-Based Recommendation System (RS). The RS ranks the available
annotators, allowing to choose one or more to label the queried instance using
their past accuracy values, and their mood and fatigue levels, as well as
information about the instance queried. This work bases itself on existing
literature on mood and fatigue influence on human performance, simulating
annotators in a realistic manner, and predicting their performance with the RS.
The results show that considering past accuracy values, as well as mood and
fatigue levels reduces the number of annotation errors made by the annotators,
and the uncertainty of the model through its training, when compared to not
using internal factors. Accuracy and F1-score values were also better in the
proposed approach, despite not being as substantial as the aforementioned. The
methodologies and findings presented in this study begin to explore the open
challenge of human cognitive factors affecting AL.

TL;DR: CODA是一种主动模型选择方法，通过利用候选模型的预测结果优先标注能高效区分最佳模型的数据点，显著减少标注工作量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模型选择需要大量标注验证数据，成本高且耗时，CODA旨在通过主动学习减少标注需求。

Method: CODA采用概率框架建模分类器、类别和数据点之间的关系，利用模型间的共识和分歧指导标注过程，并通过贝叶斯推断更新最佳模型信念。

Result: 在26个基准任务上，CODA比现有方法显著减少70%以上的标注工作量。

Conclusion: CODA提供了一种高效的主动模型选择方法，大幅降低了标注成本。

Abstract: The widespread availability of off-the-shelf machine learning models poses a
challenge: which model, of the many available candidates, should be chosen for
a given data analysis task? This question of model selection is traditionally
answered by collecting and annotating a validation dataset -- a costly and
time-intensive process. We propose a method for active model selection, using
predictions from candidate models to prioritize the labeling of test data
points that efficiently differentiate the best candidate. Our method, CODA,
performs consensus-driven active model selection by modeling relationships
between classifiers, categories, and data points within a probabilistic
framework. The framework uses the consensus and disagreement between models in
the candidate pool to guide the label acquisition process, and Bayesian
inference to update beliefs about which model is best as more information is
collected. We validate our approach by curating a collection of 26 benchmark
tasks capturing a range of model selection scenarios. CODA outperforms existing
methods for active model selection significantly, reducing the annotation
effort required to discover the best model by upwards of 70% compared to the
previous state-of-the-art. Code and data are available at

TL;DR: PancreasDG是一个多中心3D MRI胰腺分割数据集，用于研究医学影像中的领域泛化问题，填补了胰腺在跨域基准中的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胰腺分割在腹部影像中具有挑战性，且现有基准忽略了序列间的变异性。

Method: 提出PancreasDG数据集，包含563个MRI扫描，支持跨中心和跨序列研究，并提出半监督方法。

Result: 揭示了采样方差、跨中心性能与源域性能的相关性，以及跨序列偏移需专门解决方案。半监督方法显著优于现有技术。

Conclusion: PancreasDG为医学影像领域泛化设定了新基准。

Abstract: Clinical magnetic-resonance (MR) protocols generate many T1 and T2 sequences
whose appearance differs more than the acquisition sites that produce them.
Existing domain-generalization benchmarks focus almost on cross-center shifts
and overlook this dominant source of variability. Pancreas segmentation remains
a major challenge in abdominal imaging: the gland is small, irregularly,
surrounded by organs and fat, and often suffers from low T1 contrast.
State-of-the-art deep networks that already achieve >90% Dice on the liver or
kidneys still miss 20-30% of the pancreas. The organ is also systematically
under-represented in public cross-domain benchmarks, despite its clinical
importance in early cancer detection, surgery, and diabetes research. To close
this gap, we present PancreasDG, a large-scale multi-center 3D MRI pancreas
segmentation dataset for investigating domain generalization in medical
imaging. The dataset comprises 563 MRI scans from six institutions, spanning
both venous phase and out-of-phase sequences, enabling study of both
cross-center and cross-sequence variations with pixel-accurate pancreas masks
created by a double-blind, two-pass protocol. Through comprehensive analysis,
we reveal three insights: (i) limited sampling introduces significant variance
that may be mistaken for distribution shifts, (ii) cross-center performance
correlates with source domain performance for identical sequences, and (iii)
cross-sequence shifts require specialized solutions. We also propose a
semi-supervised approach that leverages anatomical invariances, significantly
outperforming state-of-the-art domain generalization techniques with 61.63%
Dice score improvements and 87.00% on two test centers for cross-sequence
segmentation. PancreasDG sets a new benchmark for domain generalization in
medical imaging. Dataset, code, and models will be available at

Abstract: High-resolution satellite imagery is essential for geospatial analysis, yet
differences in spatial resolution across satellite sensors present challenges
for data fusion and downstream applications. Super-resolution techniques can
help bridge this gap, but existing methods rely on artificially downscaled
images rather than real sensor data and are not well suited for heterogeneous
satellite sensors with differing spectral, temporal characteristics. In this
work, we develop a preliminary framework to align and Harmonized Landsat
Sentinel 30m(HLS 30) imagery using Harmonized Landsat Sentinel 10m(HLS10) as a
reference from the HLS dataset. Our approach aims to bridge the resolution gap
between these sensors and improve the quality of super-resolved Landsat
imagery. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness
of our method, showing its potential for enhancing satellite-based sensing
applications. This study provides insights into the feasibility of
heterogeneous satellite image super-resolution and highlights key
considerations for future advancements in the field.
