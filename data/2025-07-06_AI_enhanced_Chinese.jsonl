Classical numerical solvers often\nrequire fine spatiotemporal grids to satisfy stability, consistency, and\nconvergence conditions, leading to substantial computational costs. Although\nmachine learning has demonstrated better efficiency, they typically suffer from\nissues of interpretability, generalizability, and data dependency. Hence, we\npropose a learnable and differentiable finite volume solver, called LDSolver,\ndesigned for efficient and accurate simulation of fluid flows on spatiotemporal\ncoarse grids. LDSolver comprises two key components: (1) a differentiable\nfinite volume solver, and (2) an learnable module providing equivalent\napproximation for fluxes (derivatives and interpolations), and temporal error\ncorrection on coarse grids. Even with limited training data (e.g., only a few\ntrajectories), our model could accelerate the simulation while maintaining a\nhigh accuracy with superior generalizability.

However, intelligent\nmachines generally have no enough computing resources when faced with huge\nvolume of data. This paper develops a new method based on sampling techniques\nand rough set theory to address the challenge of feature selection for massive\ndata. To this end, this paper proposes using the ratio of discernible object\npairs to all object pairs that should be distinguished to measure the\ndiscriminatory ability of a feature set. Based on this measure, a new feature\nselection method is proposed. This method constructs positive region preserved\nsamples from massive data to find a feature subset with high discriminatory\nability. Compared with other methods, the proposed method has two advantages.\nFirst, it is able to select a feature subset that can preserve the\ndiscriminatory ability of all the features of the target massive data set\nwithin an acceptable time on a personal computer.

Multi-variate time-series (MTS) analysis has emerged as a\ncritical methodology for enabling real-time monitoring, fault detection, and\npredictive maintenance in such environments. However, anomaly prediction in\nsemiconductor fabrication presents several critical challenges, including high\ndata dimensionality, severe class imbalance due to the rarity of true faults,\nnoisy and missing measurements, and non-stationary behavior of production\nsystems. Furthermore, the complex interdependencies between variables and the\ndelayed emergence of faults across downstream stages complicate both anomaly\ndetection and root-cause-analysis. This paper presents a novel and generic\napproach for anomaly detection in MTS data using machine learning. The proposed\nmethodology consists of three main steps: a) converting MTS data into\nimage-based representations using the Continuous Wavelet Transform, b)\ndeveloping a multi-class image classifier by fine-tuning a pretrained VGG-16\narchitecture on custom CWT image datasets, and c) constructing a Siamese\nnetwork composed of two identical sub-networks, each utilizing the fine-tuned\nVGG-16 as a backbone. The network takes pairs of CWT images as input -one\nserving as a reference or anchor (representing a known-good signal), and the\nother as a query (representing an unknown signal). The model then compares the\nembeddings of both inputs to determine whether they belong to the same class at\na given time step.

Recent advances demonstrate that trajectory planning\ncan also be performed by supervised sequence learning of trajectories, often\nrequiring only a single or fixed number of passes through a neural\narchitecture, thus ensuring a bounded computation time. Such fully supervised\napproaches, however, perform imitation learning; they do not learn based on\nwhether the trajectories can successfully reach a goal, but try to reproduce\nobserved trajectories.

(Accepted)", "summary": "Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) are fundamental in various scientific\napplications, ranging from biomedical protein-protein interactions (PPI) to\nlarge-scale recommendation systems. An essential component for modeling graph\nstructures in GCNs is sparse general matrix-matrix multiplication (SpGEMM). As\nthe size of graph data continues to scale up, SpGEMMs are often conducted in an\nout-of-core fashion due to limited GPU memory space in resource-constrained\nsystems. Albeit recent efforts that aim to alleviate the memory constraints of\nout-of-core SpGEMM through either GPU feature caching, hybrid CPU-GPU memory\nlayout, or performing the computation in sparse format, current systems suffer\nfrom both high I/O latency and GPU under-utilization issues.\n  In this paper, we first identify the problems of existing systems, where\nsparse format data alignment and memory allocation are the main performance\nbottlenecks, and propose AIRES, a novel algorithm-system co-design solution to\naccelerate out-of-core SpGEMM computation for GCNs. Specifically, from the\nalgorithm angle, AIRES proposes to alleviate the data alignment issues on the\nblock level for matrices in sparse formats and develops a tiling algorithm to\nfacilitate row block-wise alignment. On the system level, AIRES employs a\nthree-phase dynamic scheduling that features a dual-way data transfer strategy\nutilizing a tiered memory system: integrating GPU memory, GPU Direct Storage\n(GDS), and host memory to reduce I/O latency and improve throughput.\nEvaluations show that AIRES significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art\nmethods, achieving up to 1.8x lower latency in real-world graph processing\nbenchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faAIRES\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u7b97\u6cd5-\u7cfb\u7edf\u534f\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u52a0\u901fGCN\u4e2d\u7684\u5916\u6838SpGEMM\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u5206\u914d\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u89c4\u6a21\u6269\u5927\uff0c\u5916\u6838SpGEMM\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u9ad8I/O\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548cGPU\u5229\u7528\u7387\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "AIRES\u901a\u8fc7\u5757\u7ea7\u7a00\u758f\u683c\u5f0f\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u5206\u5757\u7b97\u6cd5\u4f18\u5316\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u5ea6\u548c\u53cc\u8def\u6570\u636e\u4f20\u8f93\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "AIRES\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u56fe\u5904\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e\u8fbe1.8\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "AIRES\u901a\u8fc7\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u534f\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5916\u6838SpGEMM\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

We\nprovide reasonable baseline models for these tasks. Furthermore, we propose\nConfidence Adjusted top-1 ground truth Ratio (CAR), a novel recommendation\nmetric that offers a fine-grained analysis of model behavior.

In this work, we\nbenchmark several state-of-the-art foundational LLMs - including models from\nOpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta, and Deepseek, and compare them with our\nproprietary domain-specific hiring model (Match Score) for job candidate\nmatching.

Our experiments on\na dataset of roughly 10,000 real-world recent candidate-job pairs show that\nMatch Score outperforms the general-purpose LLMs on accuracy (ROC AUC 0.85 vs\n0.77) and achieves significantly more equitable outcomes across demographic\ngroups. Notably, Match Score attains a minimum race-wise impact ratio of 0.957\n(near-parity), versus 0.809 or lower for the best LLMs, (0.906 vs 0.773 for the\nintersectionals, respectively). We discuss why pretraining biases may cause\nLLMs with insufficient safeguards to propagate societal biases in hiring\nscenarios, whereas a bespoke supervised model can more effectively mitigate\nthese biases. Our findings highlight the importance of domain-specific modeling\nand bias auditing when deploying AI in high-stakes domains such as hiring, and\ncaution against relying on off-the-shelf LLMs for such tasks without extensive\nfairness safeguards.

To address these\nissues, this paper propose FMOcc, a Tri-perspective View (TPV) refinement\noccupancy network with flow matching selective state space model for few-frame\n3D occupancy prediction. Firstly, to generate missing features, we designed a\nfeature refinement module based on a flow matching model, which is called Flow\nMatching SSM module (FMSSM). Furthermore, by designing the TPV SSM layer and\nPlane Selective SSM (PS3M), we selectively filter TPV features to reduce the\nimpact of air voxels on non-air voxels, thereby enhancing the overall\nefficiency of the model and prediction capability for distant scenes. Finally,\nwe design the Mask Training (MT) method to enhance the robustness of FMOcc and\naddress the issue of sensor data loss.

In the proposed BiDA, a triple-branch\ntransformer architecture (the source branch, target branch, and coupled branch)\nwith semantic tokenizer is designed as the backbone. Specifically, the source\nbranch and target branch independently learn the adaptive space of source and\ntarget domains, a Coupled Multi-head Cross-attention (CMCA) mechanism is\ndeveloped in coupled branch for feature interaction and inter-domain\ncorrelation mining.

Notably, recent advances in\npre-trained Visual Foundation Models (VFMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated\nconsiderable potential in enhancing the generalization capabilities of deep\nlearning models. Despite the increasing attention toward VFM-based domain\nprompt tuning within DG, the effective design of prompts capable of\ndisentangling invariant features across diverse domains remains a critical\nchallenge. In this paper, we propose addressing this challenge by leveraging\nthe controllable and flexible language prompt of the VFM.

This framework first\nautomatically disentangles the text prompt using a large language model (LLM)\nand then learns domain-invariant visual representation guided by the\ndisentangled text feature. However, relying solely on language to guide visual\nfeature disentanglement has limitations, as visual features can sometimes be\ntoo complex or nuanced to be fully captured by descriptive text. To address\nthis, we introduce Worst Explicit Representation Alignment (WERA), which\nextends text-guided visual prompts by incorporating an additional set of\nabstract prompts. These prompts enhance source domain diversity through\nstylized image augmentations, while alignment constraints ensure that visual\nrepresentations remain consistent across both the original and augmented\ndistributions.

However, applying SAM to\nremote sensing (RS) images still faces two major challenges. First, manually\nconstructing precise prompts for each image (e.g., points or boxes) is\nlabor-intensive and inefficient, especially in RS scenarios with dense small\nobjects or spatially fragmented distributions. Second, SAM lacks domain\nadaptability, as it is pre-trained primarily on natural images and struggles to\ncapture RS-specific semantics and spatial characteristics, especially when\nsegmenting novel or unseen classes. To address these issues, inspired by\nfew-shot learning, we propose ViRefSAM, a novel framework that guides SAM\nutilizing only a few annotated reference images that contain class-specific\nobjects. Without requiring manual prompts, ViRefSAM enables automatic\nsegmentation of class-consistent objects across RS images. Specifically,\nViRefSAM introduces two key components while keeping SAM's original\narchitecture intact: (1) a Visual Contextual Prompt Encoder that extracts\nclass-specific semantic clues from reference images and generates object-aware\nprompts via contextual interaction with target images; and (2) a Dynamic Target\nAlignment Adapter, integrated into SAM's image encoder, which mitigates the\ndomain gap by injecting class-specific semantics into target image features,\nenabling SAM to dynamically focus on task-relevant regions.

The\nsimulation results conducted on the APY datasets show that the proposed KGZS-SC\nnetwork exhibits robust generalization and significantly outperforms existing\nSC frameworks in classifying unseen categories across a range of SNR levels.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8bed\u4e49\u901a\u4fe1\u7f51\u7edc\uff08KGZS-SC\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\u63d0\u5347\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u8bed\u4e49\u901a\u4fe1\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u672a\u89c1\u6570\u636e\u65f6\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u8bed\u4e49\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\uff08KG-SKB\uff09\u5bf9\u9f50\u8bed\u4e49\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\uff08ZSL\uff09\u5b9e\u73b0\u672a\u89c1\u6570\u636e\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u5206\u7c7b\u3002", "result": "\u5728APY\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cKGZS-SC\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\u4e0b\u5bf9\u672a\u89c1\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "conclusion": "KGZS-SC\u7f51\u7edc\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8bed\u4e49\u901a\u4fe1\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

An\nideal generator would meet three demands at once, namely (i) keep the normal\nbackground intact, (ii) inpaint anomalous regions to tightly overlap with the\ncorresponding anomaly masks, and (iii) generate anomalous regions in a\nsemantically valid location, while still producing realistic, diverse\nappearances from only a handful of real examples. Existing diffusion-based\nmethods usually satisfy at most two of these requirements: global anomaly\ngenerators corrupt the background, whereas mask-guided ones often falter when\nthe mask is imprecise or misplaced. We propose MAGIC--Mask-guided inpainting\nwith multi-level perturbations and Context-aware alignment--to resolve all\nthree issues. At its core, MAGIC fine-tunes a Stable Diffusion inpainting\nbackbone that preserves normal regions and ensures strict adherence of the\nsynthesized anomaly to the supplied mask, directly addressing background\ncorruption and misalignment. To offset the diversity loss that fine-tuning can\ncause, MAGIC adds two complementary perturbation strategies: (i) Gaussian\nprompt-level perturbation applied during fine-tuning and inference that\nbroadens the global appearance of anomalies while avoiding low-fidelity textual\nappearances, and (ii) mask-guided spatial noise injection that enriches local\ntexture variations. Additionally, the context-aware mask alignment module forms\nsemantic correspondences and relocates masks so that every anomaly remains\nplausibly contained within the host object, eliminating out-of-boundary\nartifacts.

Moreover, most visual tokenizers map local\nimage patches into latent tokens, leading to limited global information. To\naddress this, we introduce \\textit{Hita}, a novel image tokenizer for\nautoregressive (AR) image generation. It introduces a holistic-to-local\ntokenization scheme with learnable holistic queries and local patch tokens.\nBesides, Hita incorporates two key strategies for improved alignment with the\nAR generation process: 1) it arranges a sequential structure with holistic\ntokens at the beginning followed by patch-level tokens while using causal\nattention to maintain awareness of previous tokens; and 2) before feeding the\nde-quantized tokens into the decoder, Hita adopts a lightweight fusion module\nto control information flow to prioritize holistic tokens.

A static feature\nshared across time steps captures static information, while a dynamic residual\nfield provides time-specific features.

Second,\nto ensure data diversity, the dataset covers a wide range of frame rates,\nresolutions, 419 classes of marine animals, and various static plants and\nterrains.

While its effects on training\nstability are well documented, its role at inference time is poorly understood.\nAdditionally, LN layers hinder mechanistic interpretability by introducing\nadditional nonlinearities and increasing the interconnectedness of individual\nmodel components. Here, we show that all LN layers can be removed from every\nGPT-2 model with only a small increase in validation loss (e.g. +0.03\ncross-entropy loss for GPT-2 XL). Thus, LN cannot play a substantial role in\nlanguage modeling. We find that the amount of fine-tuning data needed for LN\nremoval grows sublinearly with model parameters, suggesting scaling to larger\nmodels is feasible. We release a suite of LN-free GPT-2 models on Hugging Face.\nFurthermore, we test interpretability techniques on LN-free models.

To address these, we propose a specialized 3D makeup method named\nAvatarMakeup, leveraging a pretrained diffusion model to transfer makeup\npatterns from a single reference photo of any individual. We adopt a\ncoarse-to-fine idea to first maintain the consistent appearance and identity,\nand then to refine the details.

Coherent Duplication optimizes a global UV map by recoding\nthe averaged facial attributes among the generated makeup images. By querying\nthe global UV map, it easily synthesizes coherent makeup guidance from\narbitrary views and expressions to optimize the target avatar.

Existing TTA methods consider scenarios where data\nfrom one or multiple domains arrives in complete domain units. However, in\nclinical practice, data usually arrives in domain fragments of arbitrary\nlengths and in random arrival orders, due to resource constraints and patient\nvariability. This paper investigates a practical Free-Form Test-Time Adaptation\n(F$^{2}$TTA) task, where a source model is adapted to such free-form domain\nfragments, with shifts occurring between fragments unpredictably. In this\nsetting, these shifts could distort the adaptation process. To address this\nproblem, we propose a novel Image-level Disentangled Prompt Tuning (I-DiPT)\nframework. I-DiPT employs an image-invariant prompt to explore domain-invariant\nrepresentations for mitigating the unpredictable shifts, and an image-specific\nprompt to adapt the source model to each test image from the incoming\nfragments. The prompts may suffer from insufficient knowledge representation\nsince only one image is available for training. To overcome this limitation, we\nfirst introduce Uncertainty-oriented Masking (UoM), which encourages the\nprompts to extract sufficient information from the incoming image via masked\nconsistency learning driven by the uncertainty of the source model\nrepresentations. Then, we further propose a Parallel Graph Distillation (PGD)\nmethod that reuses knowledge from historical image-specific and image-invariant\nprompts through parallel graph networks.

The\nreliability of the results depends on the accuracy and completeness of EHR\ndata. However, EHR data often contain significant quality issues, including\nmisrepresentations of subpopulations, biases, and systematic errors, as they\nare primarily collected for clinical and billing purposes. Existing quality\nassessment methods remain insufficient, lacking systematic procedures to assess\ndata fitness for research.\n  Methods: We present the Medical Data Pecking approach, which adapts unit\ntesting and coverage concepts from software engineering to identify data\nquality concerns. We demonstrate our approach using the Medical Data Pecking\nTool (MDPT), which consists of two main components: (1) an automated test\ngenerator that uses large language models and grounding techniques to create a\ntest suite from data and study descriptions, and (2) a data testing framework\nthat executes these tests, reporting potential errors and coverage.\n  Results: We evaluated MDPT on three datasets: All of Us (AoU), MIMIC-III, and\nSyntheticMass, generating 55-73 tests per cohort across four conditions. These\ntests correctly identified 20-43 non-aligned or non-conforming data issues. We\npresent a detailed analysis of the LLM-generated test suites in terms of\nreference grounding and value accuracy.\n  Conclusion: Our approach incorporates external medical knowledge to enable\ncontext-sensitive data quality testing as part of the data analysis workflow to\nimprove the validity of its outcomes. Our approach tackles these challenges\nfrom a quality assurance perspective, laying the foundation for further\ndevelopment such as additional data modalities and improved grounding methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aMedical Data Pecking\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u5355\u5143\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u6982\u5ff5\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u7535\u5b50\u5065\u5eb7\u8bb0\u5f55\uff08EHR\uff09\u6570\u636e\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u5de5\u5177MDPT\u8fdb\u884c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u751f\u6210\u548c\u6267\u884c\u3002", "motivation": "EHR\u6570\u636e\u5728\u6d41\u884c\u75c5\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u548cAI\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u5e7f\u6cdb\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u8d28\u91cf\u95ee\u9898\u548c\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u5f71\u54cd\u4e86\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u5355\u5143\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86MDPT\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u81ea\u52a8\u6d4b\u8bd5\u751f\u6210\u5668\u548c\u6570\u636e\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u8bc6\u522b\u4e8620-43\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e86LLM\u751f\u6210\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5957\u4ef6\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u5916\u90e8\u533b\u5b66\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Central to this approach is\na generative mechanism that creates \\emph{virtual tasks} -- synthetic problem\ninstances designed to enable the meta-learner to learn \\emph{soft constraints}\nand unknown generalisable rules across related tasks. Crucially, this enables\nthe framework to generate its own informative, task-grounded datasets thereby\nfreeing machine learning (ML) training from the limitations of relying entirely\non human-generated data. By actively exploring the virtual point landscape and\nseeking out tasks lower-level learners find difficult, the meta-learner\niteratively refines constraint regions. This enhances inductive biases,\nregularises the adaptation process, and produces novel, unanticipated tasks and\nconstraints required for generalisation. Each meta-level of the hierarchy\ncorresponds to a progressively abstracted generalisation of problems solved at\nlower levels, enabling a structured and interpretable learning progression. By\ninterpreting meta-learners as category-theoretic \\emph{functors} that generate\nand condition a hierarchy of subordinate learners, we establish a compositional\nstructure that supports abstraction and knowledge transfer across progressively\ngeneralised tasks. The category-theoretic perspective unifies existing\nmeta-learning models and reveals how learning processes can be transformed and\ncompared through functorial relationships, while offering practical design\nprinciples for structuring meta-learning.

To address these issues, we propose IGDNet, a\nZero-Shot enhancement method that operates solely on a single test image,\nwithout requiring guiding priors or training data. IGDNet exhibits strong\ngeneralization ability and effectively suppresses noise while restoring\nillumination. The framework comprises a decomposition module and a denoising\nmodule. The former separates the image into illumination and reflection\ncomponents via a dense connection network, while the latter enhances\nnon-uniformly illuminated regions using an illumination-guided pixel adaptive\ncorrection method. A noise pair is generated through downsampling and refined\niteratively to produce the final result. Extensive experiments on four public\ndatasets demonstrate that IGDNet significantly improves visual quality under\ncomplex lighting conditions.

Among them,\npedestrian tracking has extremely high application value and has become the\nmost popular research category. Existing methods mainly use motion or\nappearance information for tracking, which is often difficult in complex\nscenarios. For the motion information, mutual occlusions between objects often\nprevent updating of the motion state; for the appearance information,\nnon-robust results are often obtained due to reasons such as only partial\nvisibility of the object or blurred images. Although learning how to perform\ntracking in these situations from the annotated data is the simplest solution,\nthe existing MOT dataset fails to satisfy this solution. Existing methods\nmainly have two drawbacks: relatively simple scene composition and\nnon-realistic scenarios. Although some of the video sequences in existing\ndataset do not have the above-mentioned drawbacks, the number is far from\nadequate for research purposes. To this end, we propose a difficult large-scale\ndataset for multi-pedestrian tracking, shot mainly from the first-person view\nand all from real-life complex scenarios.

IMASHRIMP incorporates two discrimination\nmodules, based on a modified ResNet-50 architecture, to classify images by the\npoint of view and determine rostrum integrity. It is proposed a \"two-factor\nauthentication (human and IA)\" system, it reduces human error in view\nclassification from 0.97% to 0% and in rostrum detection from 12.46% to 3.64%.\nAdditionally, a pose estimation module was adapted from VitPose to predict 23\nkey points on the shrimp's skeleton, with separate networks for lateral and\ndorsal views. A morphological regression module, using a Support Vector Machine\n(SVM) model, was integrated to convert pixel measurements to centimeter units.\nExperimental results show that the system effectively reduces human error,\nachieving a mean average precision (mAP) of 97.94% for pose estimation and a\npixel-to-centimeter conversion error of 0.07 (+/- 0.1) cm.

The method extends to polynomial surfaces, allowing the separation\nof data points by more complex decision boundaries. This provides a robust\nalternative to traditional linear or quadratic optimization techniques, such as\nsupport vector machines and gradient descent. Numerical experiments demonstrate\nthe efficiency and versatility of the method in handling diverse classification\ntasks, including linear and non-linear separability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u71b5\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5bfb\u627e\u5206\u7c7b\u8d85\u5e73\u9762\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u7ebf\u6027\u548c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u53ef\u5206\u6570\u636e\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u5206\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u652f\u6301\u5411\u91cf\u673a\u548c\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\uff09\u5728\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u51b3\u7b56\u8fb9\u754c\u65f6\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5728N\u7ef4\u8d85\u7acb\u65b9\u4f53\u4e2d\u641c\u7d22\u53c2\u6570\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u71b5\u51fd\u6570\u4f18\u5316\u5206\u7c7b\u8d85\u5e73\u9762\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u66f2\u9762\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u7ebf\u6027\u548c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u7075\u6d3b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u5206\u7c7b\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u4f18\u5316\u6280\u672f\u3002"}}

In this\nwork, we find that human appearance can provide a straightforward cue to\naddress these obstacles. Based on this observation, we propose a dual-branch\noptimization framework to reconstruct accurate interactive motions with\nplausible body contacts constrained by human appearances, social proxemics, and\nphysical laws.

With the proxemics prior and diverse constraints, our\nmethod is capable of estimating accurate interactions from in-the-wild videos\ncaptured in complex environments. We further build a dataset with pseudo\nground-truth interaction annotations, which may promote future research on pose\nestimation and human behavior understanding.

GRPO-style approaches implement\nthis by using self-generated samples labeled by an outcome-based verifier.\nHowever, these methods depend heavily on the model's initial ability to produce\npositive samples. They primarily refine what the model already knows\n(distribution sharpening) rather than enabling the model to solve problems\nwhere it initially fails. This limitation is especially problematic in\nearly-stage RL training and on challenging reasoning tasks, where positive\nsamples are unlikely to be generated. To unlock reasoning ability in such\nsettings, the model must explore new reasoning trajectories beyond its current\noutput distribution. Such exploration requires access to sufficiently good\npositive samples to guide the learning. While expert demonstrations seem like a\nnatural solution, we find that they are often ineffective in RL post-training.\nInstead, we identify two key properties of effective positive samples: they\nshould (1) be likely under the current policy, and (2) increase the model's\nlikelihood of predicting the correct answer. Based on these insights, we\npropose $\\textbf{Self-Explanation Policy Optimization (ExPO)}$-a simple and\nmodular framework that generates such samples by conditioning on the\nground-truth answer.

Creating such detailed face avatars from\nvideos is a challenging problem and has numerous applications in augmented and\nvirtual reality. While tremendous successes have been achieved for static\nfaces, animatable avatars from monocular videos still fall in the uncanny\nvalley. The de facto standard, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), represents a face\nthrough a collection of 3D Gaussian primitives. 3DGS excels at rendering static\nfaces, but the state-of-the-art still struggles with nonlinear deformations,\ncomplex lighting effects, and fine details. While most related works focus on\npredicting better Gaussian parameters from expression codes, we rethink the 3D\nGaussian representation itself and how to make it more expressive. Our insights\nlead to a novel extension of 3D Gaussians to high-dimensional multivariate\nGaussians, dubbed 'HyperGaussians'. The higher dimensionality increases\nexpressivity through conditioning on a learnable local embedding. However,\nsplatting HyperGaussians is computationally expensive because it requires\ninverting a high-dimensional covariance matrix. We solve this by\nreparameterizing the covariance matrix, dubbed the 'inverse covariance trick'.\nThis trick boosts the efficiency so that HyperGaussians can be seamlessly\nintegrated into existing models. To demonstrate this, we plug in HyperGaussians\ninto the state-of-the-art in fast monocular face avatars: FlashAvatar.

Recent developments have achieved\nthis by performing per-scene optimization with embedded language information.\nHowever, they heavily rely on the calibrated dense-view reconstruction\nparadigm, thereby suffering from severe rendering artifacts and implausible\nsemantic synthesis when limited views are available. In this paper, we\nintroduce a novel generative framework, coined LangScene-X, to unify and\ngenerate 3D consistent multi-modality information for reconstruction and\nunderstanding. Powered by the generative capability of creating more consistent\nnovel observations, we can build generalizable 3D language-embedded scenes from\nonly sparse views. Specifically, we first train a TriMap video diffusion model\nthat can generate appearance (RGBs), geometry (normals), and semantics\n(segmentation maps) from sparse inputs through progressive knowledge\nintegration. Furthermore, we propose a Language Quantized Compressor (LQC),\ntrained on large-scale image datasets, to efficiently encode language\nembeddings, enabling cross-scene generalization without per-scene retraining.\nFinally, we reconstruct the language surface fields by aligning language\ninformation onto the surface of 3D scenes, enabling open-ended language\nqueries.

To address these\nissues, this paper proposes a comprehensive optimization approach centered on\nmulti-attention interaction mechanisms. First, an unsupervised,\nstatistics-guided diffusion model is employed to perform data augmentation,\nthereby alleviating the problems of labeled data scarcity and severe class\nimbalance. Second, a multi-branch spatio-temporal interaction network is\ndesigned, which captures multi-scale features of sequential data through\nparallel residual branches with 3*3, 5*5, and 7*7 convolutional kernels.\nSimultaneously, temporal attention mechanisms are incorporated to identify\ncritical time points, while spatial attention enhances inter-sensor\ninteractions. A cross-branch feature fusion unit is further introduced to\nimprove the overall feature representation capability. Finally, an adaptive\nmulti-loss function fusion strategy is integrated, allowing for dynamic\nadjustment of loss weights and overall model optimization.

However, the security vulnerabilities exhibited by the visual\nmodality pose significant challenges to deploying such models in open-world\nenvironments. Recent studies have successfully induced harmful responses from\ntarget MLLMs by encoding harmful textual semantics directly into visual inputs.\nHowever, in these approaches, the visual modality primarily serves as a trigger\nfor unsafe behavior, often exhibiting semantic ambiguity and lacking grounding\nin realistic scenarios. In this work, we define a novel setting: visual-centric\njailbreak, where visual information serves as a necessary component in\nconstructing a complete and realistic jailbreak context.

At its core, LiteReality first performs scene\nunderstanding and parses the results into a coherent 3D layout and objects with\nthe help of a structured scene graph. It then reconstructs the scene by\nretrieving the most visually similar 3D artist-crafted models from a curated\nasset database. Next, the Material Painting module enhances realism by\nrecovering high-quality, spatially varying materials. Finally, the\nreconstructed scene is integrated into a simulation engine with basic physical\nproperties to enable interactive behavior.
