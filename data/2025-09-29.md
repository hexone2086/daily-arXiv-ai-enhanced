Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种模型无关的框架，使用直接偏好优化(DPO)来提升放射学报告生成(RRG)的准确性，通过随机对比采样构建训练对，无需奖励模型或人工偏好标注。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有放射学报告生成方法在真实临床环境中的质量仍不足，而大型视觉语言模型在通用领域通过采用LLM训练策略取得了显著进展。

Method: 使用直接偏好优化(DPO)框架，通过随机对比采样构建训练对，无需额外训练数据或人工标注。

Result: 在三个最先进模型上补充使用随机DPO后，临床性能指标提升高达5%。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效提升放射学报告生成质量，无需额外数据或人工标注，具有实际部署潜力。

Abstract: Radiography Report Generation (RRG) has gained significant attention in
medical image analysis as a promising tool for alleviating the growing workload
of radiologists. However, despite numerous advancements, existing methods have
yet to achieve the quality required for deployment in real-world clinical
settings. Meanwhile, large Visual Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated
remarkable progress in the general domain by adopting training strategies
originally designed for Large Language Models (LLMs), such as alignment
techniques. In this paper, we introduce a model-agnostic framework to enhance
RRG accuracy using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Our approach leverages
random contrastive sampling to construct training pairs, eliminating the need
for reward models or human preference annotations. Experiments on supplementing
three state-of-the-art models with our Random DPO show that our method improves
clinical performance metrics by up to 5%, without requiring any additional
training data.

*William Saakyan,Matthias Norden,Lola Eversmann,Simon Kirsch,Muyu Lin,Simon Guendelman,Isabel Dziobek,Hanna Drimalla*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种多模态分析方法，通过整合面部表情、语音韵律、头部运动、心率变异性和注视行为等行为标记，改进了自闭症谱系障碍的视频诊断方法，特别是通过新的统计描述符提升了注视特征的分类准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自闭症计算机辅助诊断方法存在注视特征性能差和缺乏现实世界泛化能力的问题，需要开发更有效的多模态分析方法来改进诊断准确性。

Method: 使用包含168名ASC参与者和157名非自闭症参与者的标准化视频数据集，进行多模态分析，包括面部表情、语音韵律、头部运动、心率变异性和注视行为，并引入了量化注视角度变异性的新型统计描述符，采用后期融合方法整合各模态特征。

Result: 新型注视统计描述符将基于注视的分类准确率从64%提升到69%，通过多模态融合实现了74%的分类准确率，验证了整合多种行为标记的有效性。

Conclusion: 研究表明基于视频的多模态分析方法具有开发可扩展自闭症筛查工具的潜力，能够支持自闭症评估工作。

Abstract: Due to the complex and resource-intensive nature of diagnosing Autism
Spectrum Condition (ASC), several computer-aided diagnostic support methods
have been proposed to detect autism by analyzing behavioral cues in patient
video data. While these models show promising results on some datasets, they
struggle with poor gaze feature performance and lack of real-world
generalizability. To tackle these challenges, we analyze a standardized video
dataset comprising 168 participants with ASC (46% female) and 157 non-autistic
participants (46% female), making it, to our knowledge, the largest and most
balanced dataset available. We conduct a multimodal analysis of facial
expressions, voice prosody, head motion, heart rate variability (HRV), and gaze
behavior. To address the limitations of prior gaze models, we introduce novel
statistical descriptors that quantify variability in eye gaze angles, improving
gaze-based classification accuracy from 64% to 69% and aligning computational
findings with clinical research on gaze aversion in ASC. Using late fusion, we
achieve a classification accuracy of 74%, demonstrating the effectiveness of
integrating behavioral markers across multiple modalities. Our findings
highlight the potential for scalable, video-based screening tools to support
autism assessment.

### [3] [KV-Efficient VLA: A Method of Speed up Vision Language Model with RNN-Gated Chunked KV Cache](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21354)
*Wanshun Xu,Long Zhuang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: KV-Efficient VLA是一个模型无关的内存压缩框架，通过选择性保留高价值上下文来减少VLA模型在长序列推理时的KV内存消耗和注意力计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLA模型在长序列推理时面临注意力计算成本二次增长和KV内存无限增长的问题，现有方法虽然通过扩展主干架构提升泛化能力，但忽视了推理效率对实时部署的重要性。

Method: 将KV缓存划分为固定大小的块，使用循环门控模块根据学习的效用分数来总结和过滤历史上下文，保留最近的细粒度细节同时积极修剪过时、低相关性的内存。

Result: 理论上可实现1.21倍推理加速和36% KV内存减少，对任务成功率影响最小，且能无缝集成到现有的自回归和混合VLA堆栈中。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种可扩展的推理解决方案，无需修改训练流程或下游控制逻辑，有效解决了VLA模型在长序列推理时的效率瓶颈。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models promise unified robotic perception and
control, yet their scalability is constrained by the quadratic cost of
attention and the unbounded growth of key-value (KV) memory during long-horizon
inference. While recent methods improve generalization through scaling backbone
architectures, they often neglect the inference inefficiencies critical to
real-time deployment. In this work, we present KV-Efficient VLA, a
model-agnostic memory compression framework that addresses these limitations by
introducing a lightweight, training-friendly mechanism to selectively retain
high-utility context. Our method partitions the KV cache into fixed size chunks
and employs a recurrent gating module to summarize and filter historical
context according to learned utility scores. This design preserves recent
fine-grained detail while aggressively pruning stale, low-relevance memory, all
while maintaining causality. Theoretically, KV-Efficient VLA yields up to 1.21x
inference speedup and 36% KV memory reduction, with minimal impact on task
success. Our method integrates seamlessly into existing autoregressive and
hybrid VLA stacks, enabling scalable inference without modifying training
pipelines or downstream control logic.

### [4] [Phrase-grounded Fact-checking for Automatically Generated Chest X-ray Reports](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21356)
*Razi Mahmood,Diego Machado-Reyes,Joy Wu,Parisa Kaviani,Ken C. L. Wong,Niharika D'Souza,Mannudeep Kalra,Ge Wang,Pingkun Yan,Tanveer Syeda-Mahmood*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于短语定位的事实核查模型，用于检测自动生成的胸部X光报告中事实错误和幻觉问题，通过多标签跨模态对比回归网络实现高精度验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模视觉语言模型生成的放射学报告存在事实错误和幻觉问题，阻碍了其临床转化应用。

Method: 通过扰动真实报告中的发现和位置创建合成数据集，训练多标签跨模态对比回归网络进行事实核查。

Result: 在多个X光数据集上表现出色，与基于真实标注的验证结果高度一致（一致性相关系数0.997）。

Conclusion: 该方法在放射学工作流程中具有临床应用价值，能有效检测报告生成器产生的错误。

Abstract: With the emergence of large-scale vision language models (VLM), it is now
possible to produce realistic-looking radiology reports for chest X-ray images.
However, their clinical translation has been hampered by the factual errors and
hallucinations in the produced descriptions during inference. In this paper, we
present a novel phrase-grounded fact-checking model (FC model) that detects
errors in findings and their indicated locations in automatically generated
chest radiology reports.
  Specifically, we simulate the errors in reports through a large synthetic
dataset derived by perturbing findings and their locations in ground truth
reports to form real and fake findings-location pairs with images. A new
multi-label cross-modal contrastive regression network is then trained on this
dataset. We present results demonstrating the robustness of our method in terms
of accuracy of finding veracity prediction and localization on multiple X-ray
datasets. We also show its effectiveness for error detection in reports of SOTA
report generators on multiple datasets achieving a concordance correlation
coefficient of 0.997 with ground truth-based verification, thus pointing to its
utility during clinical inference in radiology workflows.

### [5] [MDF-MLLM: Deep Fusion Through Cross-Modal Feature Alignment for Contextually Aware Fundoscopic Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21358)
*Jason Jordan,Mohammadreza Akbari Lor,Peter Koulen,Mei-Ling Shyu,Shu-Ching Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的多模态深度学习架构MDF-MLLM，通过融合视网膜眼底图像的细粒度特征和全局文本上下文，显著提升了疾病分类准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型在捕捉诊断视网膜疾病所需的关键低层次空间细节方面存在困难，这限制了其在眼底图像分类中的表现。

Method: MDF-MLLM将U-Net编码器四层的跳跃特征集成到LLaMA 3.2 11B MLLM的交叉注意力块中，采用补丁级投影、缩放交叉注意力和基于FiLM的U-Net调制进行特征融合。

Result: 在双类型疾病分类任务中，MDF-MLLM实现了94%的准确率，比基线MLLM的60%提升了56%，召回率和F1分数分别提高了67%和35%。

Conclusion: MDF-MLLM提供了一个可泛化、可解释和模块化的眼底图像分类框架，通过多尺度特征融合显著优于传统MLLM基线，有望在临床决策支持系统中实际部署。

Abstract: This study aimed to enhance disease classification accuracy from retinal
fundus images by integrating fine-grained image features and global textual
context using a novel multimodal deep learning architecture. Existing
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) often struggle to capture low-level
spatial details critical for diagnosing retinal diseases such as glaucoma,
diabetic retinopathy, and retinitis pigmentosa. This model development and
validation study was conducted on 1,305 fundus image-text pairs compiled from
three public datasets (FIVES, HRF, and StoneRounds), covering acquired and
inherited retinal diseases, and evaluated using classification accuracy and
F1-score. The MDF-MLLM integrates skip features from four U-Net encoder layers
into cross-attention blocks within a LLaMA 3.2 11B MLLM. Vision features are
patch-wise projected and fused using scaled cross-attention and FiLM-based
U-Net modulation. Baseline MLLM achieved 60% accuracy on the dual-type disease
classification task. MDF-MLLM, with both U-Net and MLLM components fully
fine-tuned during training, achieved a significantly higher accuracy of 94%,
representing a 56% improvement. Recall and F1-scores improved by as much as 67%
and 35% over baseline, respectively. Ablation studies confirmed that the
multi-depth fusion approach contributed to substantial gains in spatial
reasoning and classification, particularly for inherited diseases with rich
clinical text. MDF-MLLM presents a generalizable, interpretable, and modular
framework for fundus image classification, outperforming traditional MLLM
baselines through multi-scale feature fusion. The architecture holds promise
for real-world deployment in clinical decision support systems. Future work
will explore synchronized training techniques, a larger pool of diseases for
more generalizability, and extending the model for segmentation tasks.

### [6] [Multimodal Prompt Decoupling Attack on the Safety Filters in Text-to-Image Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21360)
*Xingkai Peng,Jun Jiang,Meng Tong,Shuai Li,Weiming Zhang,Nenghai Yu,Kejiang Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种多模态提示解耦攻击(MPDA)，利用图像模态分离原始不安全提示的有害语义组件，通过LLM将不安全提示解耦为伪安全提示和有害提示，绕过T2I模型的安全过滤器生成NSFW内容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有越狱方法主要操纵文本提示，图像输入中的潜在漏洞未被充分探索，且文本方法难以绕过模型的安全过滤器。

Method: MPDA包含三个核心步骤：1) LLM将不安全提示解耦为伪安全提示和有害提示；2) LLM将有害提示重写为自然对抗提示以绕过过滤器；3) 视觉语言模型生成图像描述，指导LLM迭代重写和优化生成内容。

Result: 该方法能够有效绕过T2I模型的安全过滤器，生成与原始不安全提示语义一致的NSFW图像。

Conclusion: MPDA揭示了T2I模型在图像模态输入中的安全漏洞，为防御此类多模态攻击提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models have been widely applied in generating
high-fidelity images across various domains. However, these models may also be
abused to produce Not-Safe-for-Work (NSFW) content via jailbreak attacks.
Existing jailbreak methods primarily manipulate the textual prompt, leaving
potential vulnerabilities in image-based inputs largely unexplored. Moreover,
text-based methods face challenges in bypassing the model's safety filters. In
response to these limitations, we propose the Multimodal Prompt Decoupling
Attack (MPDA), which utilizes image modality to separate the harmful semantic
components of the original unsafe prompt. MPDA follows three core steps:
firstly, a large language model (LLM) decouples unsafe prompts into pseudo-safe
prompts and harmful prompts. The former are seemingly harmless sub-prompts that
can bypass filters, while the latter are sub-prompts with unsafe semantics that
trigger filters. Subsequently, the LLM rewrites the harmful prompts into
natural adversarial prompts to bypass safety filters, which guide the T2I model
to modify the base image into an NSFW output. Finally, to ensure semantic
consistency between the generated NSFW images and the original unsafe prompts,
the visual language model generates image captions, providing a new pathway to
guide the LLM in iterative rewriting and refining the generated content.

### [7] [A Mutual Learning Method for Salient Object Detection with intertwined Multi-Supervision--Revised](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21363)
*Runmin Wu,Mengyang Feng,Wenlong Guan,Dong Wang,Huchuan Lu,Errui Ding*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种通过联合利用显著目标检测、前景轮廓检测和边缘检测监督来训练显著性检测网络的方法，使用互学习模块提升性能，在多个数据集上达到最先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前深度学习方法在显著目标检测中存在的预测不完整和边界不准确问题，这些问题源于目标内部复杂性和卷积池化操作中的步长。

Method: 通过交织显著目标检测和前景轮廓检测任务生成均匀高亮的显著性图；前景轮廓和边缘检测任务相互指导；开发互学习模块(MLM)作为构建块，包含多个在互学习方式下训练的网络分支。

Result: 在七个具有挑战性的数据集上进行广泛实验，证明该方法在显著目标检测和边缘检测方面都达到了最先进的结果。

Conclusion: 提出的多任务监督方法和互学习模块有效解决了显著性检测中的不完整预测和边界不准确问题，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Though deep learning techniques have made great progress in salient object
detection recently, the predicted saliency maps still suffer from incomplete
predictions due to the internal complexity of objects and inaccurate boundaries
caused by strides in convolution and pooling operations. To alleviate these
issues, we propose to train saliency detection networks by exploiting the
supervision from not only salient object detection, but also foreground contour
detection and edge detection. First, we leverage salient object detection and
foreground contour detection tasks in an intertwined manner to generate
saliency maps with uniform highlight. Second, the foreground contour and edge
detection tasks guide each other simultaneously, thereby leading to precise
foreground contour prediction and reducing the local noises for edge
prediction. In addition, we develop a novel mutual learning module (MLM) which
serves as the building block of our method. Each MLM consists of multiple
network branches trained in a mutual learning manner, which improves the
performance by a large margin. Extensive experiments on seven challenging
datasets demonstrate that the proposed method has delivered state-of-the-art
results in both salient object detection and edge detection.

### [8] [MAJORScore: A Novel Metric for Evaluating Multimodal Relevance via Joint Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21365)
*Zhicheng Du,Qingyang Shi,Jiasheng Lu,Yingshan Liang,Xinyu Zhang,Yiran Wang,Peiwu Qin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了MAJORScore，一种新的多模态相关性评估指标，适用于三个及以上模态的相关性评估，通过多模态联合表示实现公平的相关性评分。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态相关性评估指标通常基于双模态数据的预训练对比学习模型，仅适用于两个模态之间的关联分析，限制了多模态相似性评估的能力。

Method: 利用多模态联合表示将多个模态整合到同一潜在空间中，使不同模态能够在同一尺度上准确表示，从而支持公平的相关性评分。

Result: 实验表明，MAJORScore在一致性模态上提升了26.03%-64.29%，在不一致性模态上降低了13.28%-20.54%，相比现有方法表现更优。

Conclusion: MAJORScore可作为大规模多模态数据集相似性评估和多模态模型性能评估的更可靠指标。

Abstract: The multimodal relevance metric is usually borrowed from the embedding
ability of pretrained contrastive learning models for bimodal data, which is
used to evaluate the correlation between cross-modal data (e.g., CLIP).
However, the commonly used evaluation metrics are only suitable for the
associated analysis between two modalities, which greatly limits the evaluation
of multimodal similarity. Herein, we propose MAJORScore, a brand-new evaluation
metric for the relevance of multiple modalities ($N$ modalities, $N\ge3$) via
multimodal joint representation for the first time. The ability of multimodal
joint representation to integrate multiple modalities into the same latent
space can accurately represent different modalities at one scale, providing
support for fair relevance scoring. Extensive experiments have shown that
MAJORScore increases by 26.03%-64.29% for consistent modality and decreases by
13.28%-20.54% for inconsistence compared to existing methods. MAJORScore serves
as a more reliable metric for evaluating similarity on large-scale multimodal
datasets and multimodal model performance evaluation.

### [9] [Safety Assessment of Scaffolding on Construction Site using AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21368)
*Sameer Prabhu,Amit Patwardhan,Ramin Karim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 开发基于AI的云平台，通过点云数据分析脚手架结构变化，实现自动化安全检查，减少人工检查时间和错误。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统脚手架安全检查依赖人工视觉检查，耗时且易出错，存在安全隐患。需要利用AI和数字化技术提高检查准确性和效率。

Method: 构建云基AI平台，处理脚手架点云数据，通过对比认证参考数据和最新点云数据来检测结构修改。

Result: 提出的系统能够自动监测脚手架结构变化，减少人工检查所需时间和精力。

Conclusion: AI和数字化技术能够显著提升脚手架安全检查的效率和准确性，有助于改善建筑工地的安全状况。

Abstract: In the construction industry, safety assessment is vital to ensure both the
reliability of assets and the safety of workers. Scaffolding, a key structural
support asset requires regular inspection to detect and identify alterations
from the design rules that may compromise the integrity and stability. At
present, inspections are primarily visual and are conducted by site manager or
accredited personnel to identify deviations. However, visual inspection is
time-intensive and can be susceptible to human errors, which can lead to unsafe
conditions. This paper explores the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and
digitization to enhance the accuracy of scaffolding inspection and contribute
to the safety improvement. A cloud-based AI platform is developed to process
and analyse the point cloud data of scaffolding structure. The proposed system
detects structural modifications through comparison and evaluation of certified
reference data with the recent point cloud data. This approach may enable
automated monitoring of scaffolding, reducing the time and effort required for
manual inspections while enhancing the safety on a construction site.

### [10] [Automated Prompt Generation for Creative and Counterfactual Text-to-image Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21375)
*Aleksa Jelaca,Ying Jiao,Chang Tian,Marie-Francine Moens*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一个自动提示工程框架，用于生成反事实尺寸图像（如小海象配大按钮），通过图像评估器、监督提示重写器和DPO训练排序器来优化提示词。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本到图像生成在细粒度可控性方面仍面临挑战，特别是反事实可控性（生成违背常识模式的图像）对于创意和探索应用至关重要。

Method: 构建三组件框架：图像评估器指导数据集构建，监督提示重写器生成修订提示，DPO训练排序器选择最优提示。构建首个反事实尺寸文本-图像数据集，并改进Grounded SAM评估器。

Result: 图像评估器性能相比骨干网络提升114%，实验表明该方法优于最先进基线和ChatGPT-4o。

Conclusion: 该方法为反事实可控性的未来研究奠定了基础，在反事实尺寸生成任务上表现出色。

Abstract: Text-to-image generation has advanced rapidly with large-scale multimodal
training, yet fine-grained controllability remains a critical challenge.
Counterfactual controllability, defined as the capacity to deliberately
generate images that contradict common-sense patterns, remains a major
challenge but plays a crucial role in enabling creativity and exploratory
applications. In this work, we address this gap with a focus on counterfactual
size (e.g., generating a tiny walrus beside a giant button) and propose an
automatic prompt engineering framework that adapts base prompts into revised
prompts for counterfactual images. The framework comprises three components: an
image evaluator that guides dataset construction by identifying successful
image generations, a supervised prompt rewriter that produces revised prompts,
and a DPO-trained ranker that selects the optimal revised prompt. We construct
the first counterfactual size text-image dataset and enhance the image
evaluator by extending Grounded SAM with refinements, achieving a 114 percent
improvement over its backbone. Experiments demonstrate that our method
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and ChatGPT-4o, establishing a
foundation for future research on counterfactual controllability.

*Shiraz S Kaderuppan,Jonathan Mar,Andrew Irvine,Anurag Sharma,Muhammad Ramadan Saifuddin,Wai Leong Eugene Wong,Wai Lok Woo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究评估了使用深度神经网络（O-Net和Theta-Net）实现非荧光超分辨率光学显微镜的经济方法，发现两种模型在不同信噪比条件下具有互补性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统光学显微镜横向分辨率限制（约200nm）的问题，避免使用昂贵的特殊设备或荧光超分辨率技术，为普通显微镜用户提供经济可行的超分辨率解决方案。

Method: 使用两种自研的深度神经网络架构（O-Net和Theta-Net），对通过原子力显微镜校准的纳米级特征测试靶进行超分辨率重建评估，比较在不同图像信噪比条件下的性能。

Result: O-Net和Theta-Net在超分辨率重建中表现良好但具有互补性：高信噪比图像适合O-Net模型，低信噪比图像更适合Theta-Net模型。

Conclusion: 模型架构与源图像信噪比共同影响深度神经网络在非荧光光学纳米显微镜中的性能，即使使用相同的训练数据集和训练周期，不同架构在不同条件下表现各异。

Abstract: The field of optical microscopy spans across numerous industries and research
domains, ranging from education to healthcare, quality inspection and analysis.
Nonetheless, a key limitation often cited by optical microscopists refers to
the limit of its lateral resolution (typically defined as ~200nm), with
potential circumventions involving either costly external modules (e.g.
confocal scan heads, etc) and/or specialized techniques [e.g. super-resolution
(SR) fluorescent microscopy]. Addressing these challenges in a normal
(non-specialist) context thus remains an aspect outside the scope of most
microscope users & facilities. This study thus seeks to evaluate an alternative
& economical approach to achieving SR optical microscopy, involving
non-fluorescent phase-modulated microscopical modalities such as Zernike phase
contrast (PCM) and differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy. Two in
silico deep neural network (DNN) architectures which we developed previously
(termed O-Net and Theta-Net) are assessed on their abilities to resolve a
custom-fabricated test target containing nanoscale features calibrated via
atomic force microscopy (AFM). The results of our study demonstrate that
although both O-Net and Theta-Net seemingly performed well when super-resolving
these images, they were complementary (rather than competing) approaches to be
considered for image SR, particularly under different image signal-to-noise
ratios (SNRs). High image SNRs favoured the application of O-Net models, while
low SNRs inclined preferentially towards Theta-Net models. These findings
demonstrate the importance of model architectures (in conjunction with the
source image SNR) on model performance and the SR quality of the generated
images where DNN models are utilized for non-fluorescent optical nanoscopy,
even where the same training dataset & number of epochs are being used.

*Yinfeng Yu,Hailong Zhang,Meiling Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了DMTF-AVN方法，通过多目标架构和改进的Transformer机制，在视听导航任务中实现了最先进的性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在融合视觉和音频数据时往往忽略了更深层次的感知上下文，需要更有效的多模态线索利用方法。

Method: 使用多目标架构结合改进的Transformer机制，对跨模态信息进行过滤和选择性融合。

Result: 在Replica和Matterport3D数据集上的实验表明，DMTF-AVN在成功率、路径效率和场景适应性方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法展现出强大的可扩展性和泛化能力，为机器人导航中的先进多模态融合策略铺平了道路。

Abstract: Audiovisual embodied navigation enables robots to locate audio sources by
dynamically integrating visual observations from onboard sensors with the
auditory signals emitted by the target. The core challenge lies in effectively
leveraging multimodal cues to guide navigation. While prior works have explored
basic fusion of visual and audio data, they often overlook deeper perceptual
context. To address this, we propose the Dynamic Multi-Target Fusion for
Efficient Audio-Visual Navigation (DMTF-AVN). Our approach uses a multi-target
architecture coupled with a refined Transformer mechanism to filter and
selectively fuse cross-modal information. Extensive experiments on the Replica
and Matterport3D datasets demonstrate that DMTF-AVN achieves state-of-the-art
performance, outperforming existing methods in success rate (SR), path
efficiency (SPL), and scene adaptation (SNA). Furthermore, the model exhibits
strong scalability and generalizability, paving the way for advanced multimodal
fusion strategies in robotic navigation. The code and videos are available at

### [13] [SAEmnesia: Erasing Concepts in Diffusion Models with Sparse Autoencoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21379)
*Enrico Cassano,Riccardo Renzulli,Marco Nurisso,Mirko Zaffaroni,Alan Perotti,Marco Grangetto*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAEmnesia是一种监督式稀疏自编码器训练方法，通过系统化概念标注促进概念-神经元的一对一映射，显著提高文本到图像扩散模型的概念遗忘效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有稀疏自编码器虽然减少了神经元的多义性，但单个概念表示仍分布在多个潜在特征中，需要大量搜索过程进行概念遗忘。

Method: 引入监督式稀疏自编码器训练，通过系统化概念标注缓解特征分裂并促进特征集中化，学习具有更强概念关联的专用神经元。

Result: 在推理时，可解释表示将超参数搜索减少了96.67%；在UnlearnCanvas基准上比现有技术提升9.22%；在顺序遗忘任务中，9对象移除的遗忘准确率提高28.4%。

Conclusion: SAEmnesia通过促进概念-神经元一对一映射，显著提高了概念遗忘的效率和效果，具有优越的可扩展性。

Abstract: Effective concept unlearning in text-to-image diffusion models requires
precise localization of concept representations within the model's latent
space. While sparse autoencoders successfully reduce neuron polysemanticity
(i.e., multiple concepts per neuron) compared to the original network,
individual concept representations can still be distributed across multiple
latent features, requiring extensive search procedures for concept unlearning.
We introduce SAEmnesia, a supervised sparse autoencoder training method that
promotes one-to-one concept-neuron mappings through systematic concept
labeling, mitigating feature splitting and promoting feature centralization.
Our approach learns specialized neurons with significantly stronger concept
associations compared to unsupervised baselines. The only computational
overhead introduced by SAEmnesia is limited to cross-entropy computation during
training. At inference time, this interpretable representation reduces
hyperparameter search by 96.67% with respect to current approaches. On the
UnlearnCanvas benchmark, SAEmnesia achieves a 9.22% improvement over the
state-of-the-art. In sequential unlearning tasks, we demonstrate superior
scalability with a 28.4% improvement in unlearning accuracy for 9-object
removal.

Abstract: Deep Learning models have transformed various domains, including the
healthcare sector, particularly biomedical image classification by learning
intricate features and enabling accurate diagnostics pertaining to complex
diseases. Recent studies have adopted two different approaches to train DL
models: training from scratch and transfer learning. Both approaches demand
substantial computational time and resources due to the involvement of massive
datasets in model training. These computational demands are further increased
due to the design-space exploration required for selecting optimal
hyperparameters, which typically necessitates several training rounds. With the
growing sizes of datasets, exploring solutions to this problem has recently
gained the research community's attention. A plausible solution is to select a
subset of the dataset for training and hyperparameter search. This subset,
referred to as the corset, must be a representative set of the original
dataset. A straightforward approach to selecting the coreset could be employing
random sampling, albeit at the cost of compromising the representativeness of
the original dataset. A critical limitation of random sampling is the bias
towards the dominant classes in an imbalanced dataset. Even if the dataset has
inter-class balance, this random sampling will not capture intra-class
diversity. This study addresses this issue by introducing an intelligent,
lightweight mechanism for coreset selection. Specifically, it proposes a method
to extract intra-class diversity, forming per-class clusters that are utilized
for the final sampling. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed methodology
by conducting extensive classification experiments on a well-known biomedical
imaging dataset. Results demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms the
random sampling approach on several performance metrics for uniform conditions.

*Manel Rakez,Thomas Louis,Julien Guillaumin,Foucauld Chamming's,Pierre Fillard,Brice Amadeo,Virginie Rondeau*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LongiMam是一个端到端深度学习模型，通过整合当前和最多四次既往乳腺X光片，结合CNN和RNN捕捉空间和时间模式，显著提高了乳腺癌预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大多数深度学习模型仅使用单次或有限次数的既往乳腺X光片，且缺乏对现实世界环境中不平衡结果分布和异质性随访的适应性。

Method: 开发LongiMam模型，结合卷积神经网络和循环神经网络，整合当前和最多四次既往乳腺X光片，捕捉预测乳腺癌的空间和时间模式。

Result: 在包含既往检查的各种场景中，LongiMam始终改善预测性能。既往和当前检查的组合优于单次检查模型，而仅使用既往检查效果较差。在乳腺密度随时间变化的女性中表现最佳。

Conclusion: 纵向建模增强了乳腺癌预测，支持在筛查项目中使用重复乳腺X光片来改进风险分层。LongiMam作为开源软件公开发布。

Abstract: Risk-adapted breast cancer screening requires robust models that leverage
longitudinal imaging data. Most current deep learning models use single or
limited prior mammograms and lack adaptation for real-world settings marked by
imbalanced outcome distribution and heterogeneous follow-up. We developed
LongiMam, an end-to-end deep learning model that integrates both current and up
to four prior mammograms. LongiMam combines a convolutional and a recurrent
neural network to capture spatial and temporal patterns predictive of breast
cancer. The model was trained and evaluated using a large, population-based
screening dataset with disproportionate case-to-control ratio typical of
clinical screening. Across several scenarios that varied in the number and
composition of prior exams, LongiMam consistently improved prediction when
prior mammograms were included. The addition of prior and current visits
outperformed single-visit models, while priors alone performed less well,
highlighting the importance of combining historical and recent information.
Subgroup analyses confirmed the model's efficacy across key risk groups,
including women with dense breasts and those aged 55 years or older. Moreover,
the model performed best in women with observed changes in mammographic density
over time. These findings demonstrate that longitudinal modeling enhances
breast cancer prediction and support the use of repeated mammograms to refine
risk stratification in screening programs. LongiMam is publicly available as
open-source software.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了CNN与人类大脑在社会认知任务中的对应关系，发现CNN难以超越简单视觉处理，无法反映高阶脑处理过程，并提出了Object2Brain框架来分析不同对象类别对CNN-人类相关性的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然CNN在视觉感知任务中与人类大脑存在对应关系，但这种对应是否适用于更复杂的社会认知过程尚未明确。本研究旨在探索CNN在图像情感评估任务中与人类行为和fMRI数据的对齐程度。

Method: 通过相关性分析评估CNN架构与人类行为和fMRI数据的对齐程度，并开发Object2Brain框架，结合GradCAM和对象检测来分析不同对象类别对相关性的影响。

Result: CNN在社会认知任务中难以超越简单视觉处理，无法反映高阶脑处理；不同CNN架构显示出不同的对象类别敏感性。

Conclusion: CNN与人类大脑的对应关系在复杂社会认知任务中有限，需要开发更先进的模型来捕捉高阶认知过程。

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a popular type of computer model
that have proven their worth in many computer vision tasks. Moreover, they form
an interesting study object for the field of psychology, with shown
correspondences between the workings of CNNs and the human brain. However,
these correspondences have so far mostly been studied in the context of general
visual perception. In contrast, this paper explores to what extent this
correspondence also holds for a more complex brain process, namely social
cognition. To this end, we assess the alignment between popular CNN
architectures and both human behavioral and fMRI data for image valence
appraisal through a correlation analysis. We show that for this task CNNs
struggle to go beyond simple visual processing, and do not seem to reflect
higher-order brain processing. Furthermore, we present Object2Brain, a novel
framework that combines GradCAM and object detection at the CNN-filter level
with the aforementioned correlation analysis to study the influence of
different object classes on the CNN-to-human correlations. Despite similar
correlation trends, different CNN architectures are shown to display different
object class sensitivities.

### [17] [Debugging Concept Bottleneck Models through Removal and Retraining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21385)
*Eric Enouen,Sainyam Galhotra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个可解释的调试框架CBDebug，用于修复概念瓶颈模型中的系统性偏差问题，通过移除和重训练两个步骤，将概念级用户反馈转化为样本级辅助标签进行偏差缓解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统概念瓶颈模型的干预方法无法解决模型与专家推理之间的系统性偏差问题，比如模型从有偏数据中学习捷径，需要更有效的调试方法。

Method: 采用移除和重训练两步骤框架：移除步骤中专家识别并移除不良概念；重训练步骤中CBDebug方法将概念级反馈转化为样本级辅助标签，应用监督偏差缓解和针对性增强。

Result: CBDebug在多个CBM架构和基准测试中显著优于先前的重训练方法，有效减少了模型对不良概念的依赖。

Conclusion: 该框架为概念瓶颈模型提供了有效的系统性偏差调试方法，通过可解释性作为桥梁实现了概念级反馈到样本级标签的转化。

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) use a set of human-interpretable concepts to
predict the final task label, enabling domain experts to not only validate the
CBM's predictions, but also intervene on incorrect concepts at test time.
However, these interventions fail to address systemic misalignment between the
CBM and the expert's reasoning, such as when the model learns shortcuts from
biased data. To address this, we present a general interpretable debugging
framework for CBMs that follows a two-step process of Removal and Retraining.
In the Removal step, experts use concept explanations to identify and remove
any undesired concepts. In the Retraining step, we introduce CBDebug, a novel
method that leverages the interpretability of CBMs as a bridge for converting
concept-level user feedback into sample-level auxiliary labels. These labels
are then used to apply supervised bias mitigation and targeted augmentation,
reducing the model's reliance on undesired concepts. We evaluate our framework
with both real and automated expert feedback, and find that CBDebug
significantly outperforms prior retraining methods across multiple CBM
architectures (PIP-Net, Post-hoc CBM) and benchmarks with known spurious
correlations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 沉船是重要的海事历史标记，但传统的人工检查测深数据耗时且需要专业知识，需要自动化工具来提高检测效率。

Method: 开发基于深度学习的开源工具，使用来自五大湖和爱尔兰海岸的沉船数据进行训练，并采用合成数据生成技术增加数据集规模和多样性。

Result: 与基于深度学习的ArcGIS工具包和传统反陷坑检测方法相比，该工具在分割性能上表现更优。

Conclusion: ShipwreckFinder提供了一个有效的自动化沉船检测解决方案，其开源特性便于更广泛的应用和开发。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce ShipwreckFinder, an open-source QGIS plugin that
detects shipwrecks from multibeam sonar data. Shipwrecks are an important
historical marker of maritime history, and can be discovered through manual
inspection of bathymetric data. However, this is a time-consuming process and
often requires expert analysis. Our proposed tool allows users to automatically
preprocess bathymetry data, perform deep learning inference, threshold model
outputs, and produce either pixel-wise segmentation masks or bounding boxes of
predicted shipwrecks. The backbone of this open-source tool is a deep learning
model, which is trained on a variety of shipwreck data from the Great Lakes and
the coasts of Ireland. Additionally, we employ synthetic data generation in
order to increase the size and diversity of our dataset. We demonstrate
superior segmentation performance with our open-source tool and training
pipeline as compared to a deep learning-based ArcGIS toolkit and a more
classical inverse sinkhole detection method. The open-source tool can be found

TL;DR: 研究探讨了基于幅度的剪枝对神经网络可解释性的影响，发现轻到中度剪枝能改善显著性图的聚焦度和忠实度，而过度剪枝会降低可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前研究表明神经网络可以大幅剪枝而保持性能，但剪枝对模型可解释性的影响尚不清楚。

Method: 使用在ImageNette上训练的ResNet-18，比较不同剪枝水平下的Vanilla Gradients和Integrated Gradients解释方法，评估稀疏性和忠实度，并应用CRAFT概念提取跟踪学习概念的语义连贯性变化。

Result: 轻到中度剪枝改善了显著性图的聚焦度和忠实度，同时保留了清晰、有语义意义的概念；而过度剪枝会合并异质特征，降低显著性图稀疏性和概念连贯性，尽管仍保持准确性。

Conclusion: 剪枝可以塑造内部表征使其更符合人类注意力模式，但过度剪枝会损害可解释性。

Abstract: Prior works have shown that neural networks can be heavily pruned while
preserving performance, but the impact of pruning on model interpretability
remains unclear. In this work, we investigate how magnitude-based pruning
followed by fine-tuning affects both low-level saliency maps and high-level
concept representations. Using a ResNet-18 trained on ImageNette, we compare
post-hoc explanations from Vanilla Gradients (VG) and Integrated Gradients (IG)
across pruning levels, evaluating sparsity and faithfulness. We further apply
CRAFT-based concept extraction to track changes in semantic coherence of
learned concepts. Our results show that light-to-moderate pruning improves
saliency-map focus and faithfulness while retaining distinct, semantically
meaningful concepts. In contrast, aggressive pruning merges heterogeneous
features, reducing saliency map sparsity and concept coherence despite
maintaining accuracy. These findings suggest that while pruning can shape
internal representations toward more human-aligned attention patterns,
excessive pruning undermines interpretability.

TL;DR: TUN3D是首个基于多视图图像输入，无需真实相机位姿或深度监督，联合进行室内布局估计和3D物体检测的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法依赖点云输入的局限性，因为大多数消费级相机缺乏深度传感器，而视觉数据更为普遍。

Method: 基于轻量级稀疏卷积骨干网络，使用两个专用头：一个用于3D物体检测，一个用于布局估计，采用新颖的参数化墙壁表示。

Result: 在三个具有挑战性的场景理解基准测试中达到最先进性能：(i)使用真实点云，(ii)使用带位姿图像，(iii)使用无位姿图像。

Conclusion: TUN3D在保持与专用3D物体检测方法相当性能的同时，显著推进了布局估计，为整体室内场景理解设立了新基准。

Abstract: Layout estimation and 3D object detection are two fundamental tasks in indoor
scene understanding. When combined, they enable the creation of a compact yet
semantically rich spatial representation of a scene. Existing approaches
typically rely on point cloud input, which poses a major limitation since most
consumer cameras lack depth sensors and visual-only data remains far more
common. We address this issue with TUN3D, the first method that tackles joint
layout estimation and 3D object detection in real scans, given multi-view
images as input, and does not require ground-truth camera poses or depth
supervision. Our approach builds on a lightweight sparse-convolutional backbone
and employs two dedicated heads: one for 3D object detection and one for layout
estimation, leveraging a novel and effective parametric wall representation.
Extensive experiments show that TUN3D achieves state-of-the-art performance
across three challenging scene understanding benchmarks: (i) using ground-truth
point clouds, (ii) using posed images, and (iii) using unposed images. While
performing on par with specialized 3D object detection methods, TUN3D
significantly advances layout estimation, setting a new benchmark in holistic
indoor scene understanding. Code is available at

Conclusion: 该系统通过细化语义粒度和轻量级部署，在保持性能的同时显著提升了资源利用率，为图像语义通信提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid development of generative artificial intelligence (AI) has
introduced significant opportunities for enhancing the efficiency and accuracy
of image transmission within semantic communication systems. Despite these
advancements, existing methodologies often neglect the difference in importance
of different regions of the image, potentially compromising the reconstruction
quality of visually critical content. To address this issue, we introduce an
innovative generative semantic communication system that refines semantic
granularity by segmenting images into key and non-key regions. Key regions,
which contain essential visual information, are processed using an image
oriented semantic encoder, while non-key regions are efficiently compressed
through an image-to-text modeling approach. Additionally, to mitigate the
substantial storage and computational demands posed by large AI models, the
proposed system employs a lightweight deployment strategy incorporating model
quantization and low-rank adaptation fine-tuning techniques, significantly
boosting resource utilization without sacrificing performance. Simulation
results demonstrate that the proposed system outperforms traditional methods in
terms of both semantic fidelity and visual quality, thereby affirming its
effectiveness for image transmission tasks.

Result: 实验证明该框架在鲁棒骨架化、形状压缩和增材制造刚度增强等任务中有效。

Conclusion: 骨架化尺度空间提供了一种满足尺度空间特性的层次形状简化方法，具有理论和实用价值。

Abstract: The Hamilton-Jacobi skeleton, also known as the medial axis, is a powerful
shape descriptor that represents binary objects in terms of the centres of
maximal inscribed discs. Despite its broad applicability, the medial axis
suffers from sensitivity to noise: minor boundary variations can lead to
disproportionately large and undesirable expansions of the skeleton. Classical
pruning methods mitigate this shortcoming by systematically removing extraneous
skeletal branches. This sequential simplification of skeletons resembles the
principle of sparsification scale-spaces that embed images into a family of
reconstructions from increasingly sparse pixel representations.
  We combine both worlds by introducing skeletonisation scale-spaces: They
leverage sparsification of the medial axis to achieve hierarchical
simplification of shapes. Unlike conventional pruning, our framework inherently
satisfies key scale-space properties such as hierarchical architecture,
controllable simplification, and equivariance to geometric transformations. We
provide a rigorous theoretical foundation in both continuous and discrete
formulations and extend the concept further with densification. This allows
inverse progression from coarse to fine scales and can even reach beyond the
original skeleton to produce overcomplete shape representations with relevancy
for practical applications.
  Through proof-of-concept experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our
framework for practical tasks including robust skeletonisation, shape
compression, and stiffness enhancement for additive manufacturing.

Motivation: 现有气候预测空间分辨率低（12.5公里），限制了其在地方决策中的可用性，需要高分辨率的气候预测。

Method: 在观测网格数据上训练单图像超分辨率模型，然后应用于低分辨率气候预测；提出基于气候指标的评估方法，使用气象站观测的气候指数来评估降尺度结果。

Result: 在日平均温度上的实验表明，单图像超分辨率模型能够降尺度气候预测，且不会增加气候指标的误差。

Conclusion: 单图像超分辨率模型是提高气候预测空间分辨率的有效方法，可在没有真实高分辨率数据的情况下进行验证。

Abstract: High-resolution climate projections are essential for local decision-making.
However, available climate projections have low spatial resolution (e.g. 12.5
km), which limits their usability. We address this limitation by leveraging
single-image super-resolution models to statistically downscale climate
projections to 1-km resolution. Since high-resolution climate projections are
unavailable for training, we train models on a high-resolution observational
gridded data set and apply them to low-resolution climate projections. We
propose a climate indicator-based assessment using observed climate indices
computed at weather station locations to evaluate the downscaled climate
projections without ground-truth high-resolution climate projections.
Experiments on daily mean temperature demonstrate that single-image
super-resolution models can downscale climate projections without increasing
the error of climate indicators compared to low-resolution climate projections.

Result: 实验表明该方法生成高效且难以察觉的对抗图像，在毒性生成方面优于现有方法，并在交通领域验证了实用性

Conclusion: 基于图像的越狱攻击存在实际挑战，需要为视觉语言模型开发有效的防御机制

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have remarkable abilities in generating
multimodal reasoning tasks. However, potential misuse or safety alignment
concerns of VLMs have increased significantly due to different categories of
attack vectors. Among various attack vectors, recent studies have demonstrated
that image-based perturbations are particularly effective in generating harmful
outputs. In the literature, many existing techniques have been proposed to
jailbreak VLMs, leading to unstable performance and visible perturbations. In
this study, we propose Jailbreaking with Loss-guided Image Perturbation
(JaiLIP), a jailbreaking attack in the image space that minimizes a joint
objective combining the mean squared error (MSE) loss between clean and
adversarial image with the models harmful-output loss. We evaluate our proposed
method on VLMs using standard toxicity metrics from Perspective API and
Detoxify. Experimental results demonstrate that our method generates highly
effective and imperceptible adversarial images, outperforming existing methods
in producing toxicity. Moreover, we have evaluated our method in the
transportation domain to demonstrate the attacks practicality beyond toxic text
generation in specific domain. Our findings emphasize the practical challenges
of image-based jailbreak attacks and the need for efficient defense mechanisms
for VLMs.

Abstract: Automated identification of plants and animals has improved considerably in
the last few years, in particular thanks to the recent advances in deep
learning. The next big question is how far such automated systems are from the
human expertise. Indeed, even the best experts are sometimes confused and/or
disagree between each others when validating visual or audio observations of
living organism. A picture actually contains only a partial information that is
usually not sufficient to determine the right species with certainty.
Quantifying this uncertainty and comparing it to the performance of automated
systems is of high interest for both computer scientists and expert
naturalists. The LifeCLEF 2018 ExpertCLEF challenge presented in this paper was
designed to allow this comparison between human experts and automated systems.
In total, 19 deep-learning systems implemented by 4 different research teams
were evaluated with regard to 9 expert botanists of the French flora. The main
outcome of this work is that the performance of state-of-the-art deep learning
models is now close to the most advanced human expertise. This paper presents
more precisely the resources and assessments of the challenge, summarizes the
approaches and systems employed by the participating research groups, and
provides an analysis of the main outcomes.

Abstract: The generation of quadrilateral-dominant meshes is a cornerstone of
professional 3D content creation. However, existing generative models generate
quad meshes by first generating triangle meshes and then merging triangles into
quadrilaterals with some specific rules, which typically produces quad meshes
with poor topology. In this paper, we introduce QuadGPT, the first
autoregressive framework for generating quadrilateral meshes in an end-to-end
manner. QuadGPT formulates this as a sequence prediction paradigm,
distinguished by two key innovations: a unified tokenization method to handle
mixed topologies of triangles and quadrilaterals, and a specialized
Reinforcement Learning fine-tuning method tDPO for better generation quality.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that QuadGPT significantly surpasses previous
triangle-to-quad conversion pipelines in both geometric accuracy and
topological quality. Our work establishes a new benchmark for native quad-mesh
generation and showcases the power of combining large-scale autoregressive
models with topology-aware RL refinement for creating structured 3D assets.

TL;DR: DyME是一个动态多概念擦除框架，通过训练轻量级LoRA适配器并在推理时动态组合，解决了现有静态擦除方法在多概念场景下的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本到图像扩散模型会无意中复制受版权保护的风格和视觉概念，引发法律和伦理问题。现有擦除方法无法扩展到需要同时擦除多个可能冲突概念的实用场景。

Result: 在ErasureBench-H和标准数据集上的实验表明，DyME在保持多概念擦除保真度的同时，显著减少了非目标内容的退化，优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: DyME通过动态模块化设计和正交约束，有效解决了多概念擦除中的干扰问题，为实际应用提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models (DMs) inadvertently reproduce copyrighted
styles and protected visual concepts, raising legal and ethical concerns.
Concept erasure has emerged as a safeguard, aiming to selectively suppress such
concepts through fine-tuning. However, existing methods do not scale to
practical settings where providers must erase multiple and possibly conflicting
concepts. The core bottleneck is their reliance on static erasure: a single
checkpoint is fine-tuned to remove all target concepts, regardless of the
actual erasure needs at inference. This rigid design mismatches real-world
usage, where requests vary per generation, leading to degraded erasure success
and reduced fidelity for non-target content. We propose DyME, an on-demand
erasure framework that trains lightweight, concept-specific LoRA adapters and
dynamically composes only those needed at inference. This modular design
enables flexible multi-concept erasure, but naive composition causes
interference among adapters, especially when many or semantically related
concepts are suppressed. To overcome this, we introduce bi-level orthogonality
constraints at both the feature and parameter levels, disentangling
representation shifts and enforcing orthogonal adapter subspaces. We further

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoJudge是一个专门用于评估视频理解模型输出的多模态大语言模型，在多个基准测试中超越了更大的基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估指标如BLEU、ROUGE等无法捕捉人类判断的精细度，而人工评估成本高昂，需要开发专门针对视频理解任务的自动评估方法。

Method: 通过生成器-评估器的交互训练：生成器根据目标评分生成响应，不匹配评估器评分的响应被丢弃，从而训练专门的MLLM评估器。

Result: 在四个元评估基准中的三个上，7B参数的VideoJudge超越了更大的基线模型（如32B和72B的Qwen2.5-VL），证明视频输入对评估视频理解任务至关重要。

Conclusion: MLLM评估器在视频理解任务评估中优于纯LLM评估器，长链推理并不能改善性能，表明提供视频输入对准确评估至关重要。

Abstract: Precisely evaluating video understanding models remains challenging: commonly
used metrics such as BLEU, ROUGE, and BERTScore fail to capture the fineness of
human judgment, while obtaining such judgments through manual evaluation is
costly. Recent work has explored using large language models (LLMs) or
multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) as evaluators, but their extension to video
understanding remains relatively unexplored. In this work, we introduce
VideoJudge, a 3B and 7B-sized MLLM judge specialized to evaluate outputs from
video understanding models (\textit{i.e.}, text responses conditioned on
videos). To train VideoJudge, our recipe builds on the interplay between a
generator and an evaluator: the generator is prompted to produce responses
conditioned on a target rating, and responses not matching the evaluator's
rating are discarded. Across three out of four meta-evaluation benchmarks,
VideoJudge-7B outperforms larger MLLM judge baselines such as Qwen2.5-VL (32B
and 72B). Notably, we find that LLM judges (Qwen3) models perform worse than
MLLM judges (Qwen2.5-VL) and long chain-of-thought reasoning does not improve
performance, indicating that providing video inputs is crucial for evaluation
of video understanding tasks.

*Dereje Shenkut,B. V. K Vijaya Kumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReVQom是一种用于多智能体协同感知的端到端特征压缩方法，通过瓶颈网络和多阶段残差向量量化实现高效压缩，在保持精度的同时将特征从8192 bpp压缩到6-30 bpp。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体协同感知通过共享信息提升场景理解能力，但通信带宽限制了系统的可扩展性。

Method: 使用瓶颈网络压缩特征维度，然后采用多阶段残差向量量化，仅传输每个像素的代码索引。

Result: 在DAIR-V2X数据集上实现273倍到1365倍压缩，在18 bpp时性能与原始特征相当或更好，在6-12 bpp时支持超低带宽运行。

Conclusion: ReVQom实现了高效准确的多智能体协同感知，为实际V2X部署迈出重要一步。

Abstract: Multi-agent collaborative perception (CP) improves scene understanding by
sharing information across connected agents such as autonomous vehicles,
unmanned aerial vehicles, and robots. Communication bandwidth, however,
constrains scalability. We present ReVQom, a learned feature codec that
preserves spatial identity while compressing intermediate features. ReVQom is
an end-to-end method that compresses feature dimensions via a simple bottleneck
network followed by multi-stage residual vector quantization (RVQ). This allows
only per-pixel code indices to be transmitted, reducing payloads from 8192 bits
per pixel (bpp) of uncompressed 32-bit float features to 6-30 bpp per agent
with minimal accuracy loss. On DAIR-V2X real-world CP dataset, ReVQom achieves
273x compression at 30 bpp to 1365x compression at 6 bpp. At 18 bpp (455x),
ReVQom matches or outperforms raw-feature CP, and at 6-12 bpp it enables
ultra-low-bandwidth operation with graceful degradation. ReVQom allows
efficient and accurate multi-agent collaborative perception with a step toward
practical V2X deployment.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究分析了三种文本到图像AI模型在生成沙特阿拉伯职业图像时存在的性别刻板印象和文化不准确性，发现这些模型普遍存在严重的性别失衡和文化误解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 调查当代文本到图像AI模型在生成沙特职业图像时是否延续性别刻板印象和文化不准确性，评估这些模型对沙特劳动力市场性别动态和文化细微差别的反映程度。

Method: 使用中性提示词为56种沙特职业生成1,006张图像，由两名训练有素的沙特注释员从五个维度评估每张图像：感知性别、服装外貌、背景环境、活动互动和年龄，资深研究员对分歧进行裁决，共获得10,100个判断。

Result: 三种模型均显示强烈性别失衡：ImageFX输出85%为男性，Grok 86.6%为男性，DALL-E V3 96%为男性，其中DALL-E V3性别刻板印象最强。领导和技术角色中的性别失衡最为明显，所有模型都频繁出现服装、环境和活动方面的文化不准确性。

Conclusion: 当前模型反映了训练数据中嵌入的社会偏见，仅有限地反映了沙特劳动力市场的性别动态和文化细微差别，迫切需要更多样化的训练数据、更公平的算法和文化敏感的评估框架来确保公平真实的视觉输出。

Abstract: This study investigates the extent to which contemporary Text-to-Image
artificial intelligence (AI) models perpetuate gender stereotypes and cultural
inaccuracies when generating depictions of professionals in Saudi Arabia. We
analyzed 1,006 images produced by ImageFX, DALL-E V3, and Grok for 56 diverse
Saudi professions using neutral prompts. Two trained Saudi annotators evaluated
each image on five dimensions: perceived gender, clothing and appearance,
background and setting, activities and interactions, and age. A third senior
researcher adjudicated whenever the two primary raters disagreed, yielding
10,100 individual judgements. The results reveal a strong gender imbalance,
with ImageFX outputs being 85\% male, Grok 86.6\% male, and DALL-E V3 96\%
male, indicating that DALL-E V3 exhibited the strongest overall gender
stereotyping. This imbalance was most evident in leadership and technical
roles. Moreover, cultural inaccuracies in clothing, settings, and depicted
activities were frequently observed across all three models.
Counter-stereotypical images often arise from cultural misinterpretations
rather than genuinely progressive portrayals. We conclude that current models
mirror societal biases embedded in their training data, generated by humans,
offering only a limited reflection of the Saudi labour market's gender dynamics
and cultural nuances. These findings underscore the urgent need for more
diverse training data, fairer algorithms, and culturally sensitive evaluation
frameworks to ensure equitable and authentic visual outputs.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于推理增强的多模态大语言模型预训练范式，用于统一的不当内容检测，通过三个针对性预训练任务提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常为每种不当内容类型训练单独的小型分类模型，需要大量人工标注数据且缺乏跨问题泛化能力。

Method: 引入三个预训练任务：Caption（增强视频细节感知）、VQA（加深对问题定义和标注指南的理解）、CoT（增强推理能力）。

Result: 实验结果表明，该预训练方法显著提高了MLLM在零样本和监督微调设置下的性能，并对未见问题表现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该推理增强的MLLM预训练范式能有效解决短视频内容检测中的分布差距和复杂问题定义挑战。

Abstract: Short video platforms are evolving rapidly, making the identification of
inappropriate content increasingly critical. Existing approaches typically
train separate and small classification models for each type of issue, which
requires extensive human-labeled data and lacks cross-issue generalization. We
propose a reasoning-enhanced multimodal large language model (MLLM) pretraining
paradigm for unified inappropriate content detection. To address the
distribution gap between short video content and the original pretraining data
of MLLMs, as well as the complex issue definitions, we introduce three targeted
pretraining tasks: (1) \textit{Caption}, to enhance the MLLM's perception of
video details; (2) \textit{Visual Question Answering (VQA)}, to deepen the
MLLM's understanding of issue definitions and annotation guidelines; (3)
\textit{Chain-of-Thought (CoT)}, to enhance the MLLM's reasoning capability.
Experimental results show that our pretraining approach significantly improves
the MLLM's performance in both zero-shot and supervised fine-tuning (SFT)
settings. In addition, our pretrained model demonstrates strong generalization
capabilities to emergent, previously unseen issues.

TL;DR: 将GUI定位任务重新定义为交互式搜索任务，通过多步强化学习训练模型移动光标来定位UI元素，显著提升了定位精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统坐标预测方法在处理高分辨率GUI图像时精度不足，需要更有效的定位方式。

Method: 将GUI定位重构为交互式搜索任务，使用多步在线强化学习训练模型，通过光标移动和视觉反馈来定位目标元素。

Result: 在ScreenSpot-v2上准确率从88.8%提升到93.9%，在ScreenSpot-Pro上从26.8%提升到56.5%，95%的实例在两步内解决问题。

Conclusion: 交互式搜索方法比直接坐标预测更有效，能够自适应处理不同难度的GUI定位任务。

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) grounding is commonly framed as a coordinate
prediction task -- given a natural language instruction, generate on-screen
coordinates for actions such as clicks and keystrokes. However, recent Vision
Language Models (VLMs) often fail to predict accurate numeric coordinates when
processing high-resolution GUI images with complex layouts. To address this
issue, we reframe GUI grounding as an \emph{interactive search task}, where the
VLM generates actions to move a cursor in the GUI to locate UI elements. At
each step, the model determines the target object, evaluates the spatial
relations between the cursor and the target, and moves the cursor closer to the
target conditioned on the movement history. In this interactive process, the
rendered cursor provides visual feedback to help the model align its
predictions with the corresponding on-screen locations. We train our GUI
grounding model, GUI-Cursor, using multi-step online reinforcement learning
with a dense trajectory-based reward function. Our experimental results show
that GUI-Cursor, based on Qwen2.5-VL-7B, improves the GUI grounding accuracy
and achieves state-of-the-art results on ScreenSpot-v2 ($88.8\% \rightarrow
93.9\%$) and ScreenSpot-Pro ($26.8\% \rightarrow 56.5\%$). Moreover, we observe
that GUI-Cursor learns to solve the problem within two steps for 95\% of
instances and can adaptively conduct more steps on more difficult examples.

TL;DR: 提出了X-CoT框架，使用LLM的思维链推理替代传统的嵌入模型相似度排序，以提高文本-视频检索的可解释性和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本-视频检索系统存在两个主要问题：低质量文本-视频数据对会影响检索效果但难以识别；余弦相似度无法解释排序结果，限制了可解释性。

Method: 基于LLM的思维链推理设计检索框架，首先扩展基准数据集以支持语义理解并减少数据偏差，然后设计包含成对比较步骤的检索思维链，生成详细推理和完整排序。

Result: X-CoT在实证中提高了检索性能并产生详细推理依据，同时便于模型行为和数据质量分析。

Conclusion: X-CoT框架通过可解释的检索方法解决了传统嵌入模型相似度排序的局限性，为文本-视频检索提供了更好的性能和可解释性。

Abstract: Prevalent text-to-video retrieval systems mainly adopt embedding models for
feature extraction and compute cosine similarities for ranking. However, this
design presents two limitations. Low-quality text-video data pairs could
compromise the retrieval, yet are hard to identify and examine. Cosine
similarity alone provides no explanation for the ranking results, limiting the
interpretability. We ask that can we interpret the ranking results, so as to
assess the retrieval models and examine the text-video data? This work proposes
X-CoT, an explainable retrieval framework upon LLM CoT reasoning in place of
the embedding model-based similarity ranking. We first expand the existing
benchmarks with additional video annotations to support semantic understanding
and reduce data bias. We also devise a retrieval CoT consisting of pairwise
comparison steps, yielding detailed reasoning and complete ranking. X-CoT
empirically improves the retrieval performance and produces detailed
rationales. It also facilitates the model behavior and data quality analysis.

Motivation: 手术器械的安全检查需要可靠的视觉缺陷检测，但人工检查容易出错，现有基于自然/工业图像的自动检测方法在手术领域迁移效果不佳，存在误报、对小缺陷不敏感和领域偏移问题。

Method: 集成背景掩蔽、基于补丁的分析策略和高效的领域自适应，专门针对手术器械调整无监督缺陷检测方法。

Conclusion: 提出的方法通过针对手术器械的专门优化，实现了对细粒度缺陷的可靠检测，解决了现有方法在手术领域应用中的关键问题。

Abstract: Ensuring the safety of surgical instruments requires reliable detection of
visual defects. However, manual inspection is prone to error, and existing
automated defect detection methods, typically trained on natural/industrial
images, fail to transfer effectively to the surgical domain. We demonstrate
that simply applying or fine-tuning these approaches leads to issues: false
positive detections arising from textured backgrounds, poor sensitivity to
small, subtle defects, and inadequate capture of instrument-specific features
due to domain shift. To address these challenges, we propose a versatile method
that adapts unsupervised defect detection methods specifically for surgical
instruments. By integrating background masking, a patch-based analysis
strategy, and efficient domain adaptation, our method overcomes these
limitations, enabling the reliable detection of fine-grained defects in
surgical instrument imagery.

Motivation: 现有基于表示对齐的方法依赖计算昂贵的大型预训练编码器，需要寻找更高效的替代方案来提升扩散模型的判别特征表示。

Method: 提出线性可分性(LSEP)正则化，将线性探测直接融入网络学习动态，无需辅助编码器，通过促进中间层表示的线性可分性来训练模型。

Result: 在256×256 ImageNet数据集上达到FID 1.46，在流式Transformer架构(如SiTs)上实现了训练效率和生成质量的显著改进。

Conclusion: LSEP方法有效替代了基于表示对齐的方法，无需外部编码器，将线性探测整合到学习过程中，显著提升了扩散模型的训练效率和生成质量。

Abstract: Efficient training strategies for large-scale diffusion models have recently
emphasized the importance of improving discriminative feature representations
in these models. A central line of work in this direction is representation
alignment with features obtained from powerful external encoders, which
improves the representation quality as assessed through linear probing.
Alignment-based approaches show promise but depend on large pretrained
encoders, which are computationally expensive to obtain. In this work, we
propose an alternative regularization for training, based on promoting the
Linear SEParability (LSEP) of intermediate layer representations. LSEP
eliminates the need for an auxiliary encoder and representation alignment,
while incorporating linear probing directly into the network's learning
dynamics rather than treating it as a simple post-hoc evaluation tool. Our
results demonstrate substantial improvements in both training efficiency and
generation quality on flow-based transformer architectures such as SiTs,
achieving an FID of 1.46 on $256 \times 256$ ImageNet dataset.

Motivation: 现有对比学习方法忽略了地理空间中的空间依赖性，无法有效处理视觉和地理相似但被标记为负例的图像对（假负例），以及视觉相似但地理距离远的图像对（难负例）。

Method: 使用半变异函数将特征空间中的图像距离与地理距离关联，捕捉空间相关性。通过拟合的半变异函数定义给定空间距离下的预期视觉差异，用于识别难负例和假负例。

Result: 在OSV5M数据集上评估，显示显式建模空间先验能提高图像地理定位性能，特别是在更细粒度级别。

Conclusion: 整合空间先验的对比学习策略能有效提升图像地理定位的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Accurate and robust image-based geo-localization at a global scale is
challenging due to diverse environments, visually ambiguous scenes, and the
lack of distinctive landmarks in many regions. While contrastive learning
methods show promising performance by aligning features between street-view
images and corresponding locations, they neglect the underlying spatial
dependency in the geographic space. As a result, they fail to address the issue
of false negatives -- image pairs that are both visually and geographically
similar but labeled as negatives, and struggle to effectively distinguish hard
negatives, which are visually similar but geographically distant. To address
this issue, we propose a novel spatially regularized contrastive learning
strategy that integrates a semivariogram, which is a geostatistical tool for
modeling how spatial correlation changes with distance. We fit the
semivariogram by relating the distance of images in feature space to their
geographical distance, capturing the expected visual content in a spatial
correlation. With the fitted semivariogram, we define the expected visual
dissimilarity at a given spatial distance as reference to identify hard
negatives and false negatives. We integrate this strategy into GeoCLIP and
evaluate it on the OSV5M dataset, demonstrating that explicitly modeling
spatial priors improves image-based geo-localization performance, particularly
at finer granularity.

Abstract: We introduce X-Streamer, an end-to-end multimodal human world modeling
framework for building digital human agents capable of infinite interactions
across text, speech, and video within a single unified architecture. Starting
from a single portrait, X-Streamer enables real-time, open-ended video calls
driven by streaming multimodal inputs. At its core is a Thinker-Actor
dual-transformer architecture that unifies multimodal understanding and
generation, turning a static portrait into persistent and intelligent
audiovisual interactions. The Thinker module perceives and reasons over
streaming user inputs, while its hidden states are translated by the Actor into
synchronized multimodal streams in real time. Concretely, the Thinker leverages
a pretrained large language-speech model, while the Actor employs a chunk-wise
autoregressive diffusion model that cross-attends to the Thinker's hidden
states to produce time-aligned multimodal responses with interleaved discrete
text and audio tokens and continuous video latents. To ensure long-horizon
stability, we design inter- and intra-chunk attentions with time-aligned
multimodal positional embeddings for fine-grained cross-modality alignment and
context retention, further reinforced by chunk-wise diffusion forcing and
global identity referencing. X-Streamer runs in real time on two A100 GPUs,
sustaining hours-long consistent video chat experiences from arbitrary
portraits and paving the way toward unified world modeling of interactive

Motivation: 现有视频生成器虽然被视为世界模型，但在从单张图像预测运动方面表现不佳，特别是在简单物理场景中。这是因为它们需要生成像素而非直接建模运动。

Method: 将运动预测任务构建为条件生成密集轨迹网格的问题，采用现代视频生成器架构但输出运动轨迹而非像素，从而直接捕捉场景范围内的动态和不确定性。

Result: 该方法在模拟数据上表现优异，在机器人等下游应用中有效，在真实世界直觉物理数据集上显示出有前景的准确性，比现有回归器和生成器产生更准确和多样化的预测。

Conclusion: 直接建模运动轨迹比生成像素更有效地解决从单张图像预测运动的问题，该方法为运动预测提供了更准确和高效的解决方案。

Abstract: We consider the problem of forecasting motion from a single image, i.e.,
predicting how objects in the world are likely to move, without the ability to
observe other parameters such as the object velocities or the forces applied to
them. We formulate this task as conditional generation of dense trajectory
grids with a model that closely follows the architecture of modern video
generators but outputs motion trajectories instead of pixels. This approach
captures scene-wide dynamics and uncertainty, yielding more accurate and
diverse predictions than prior regressors and generators. We extensively
evaluate our method on simulated data, demonstrate its effectiveness on
downstream applications such as robotics, and show promising accuracy on
real-world intuitive physics datasets. Although recent state-of-the-art video
generators are often regarded as world models, we show that they struggle with
forecasting motion from a single image, even in simple physical scenarios such
as falling blocks or mechanical object interactions, despite fine-tuning on
such data. We show that this limitation arises from the overhead of generating
pixels rather than directly modeling motion.

TL;DR: 比较DINOv3和V-JEPA2两种自监督学习架构在视频动作识别中的表现，发现DINOv3在空间特征提取上表现更好，特别擅长姿态识别，而V-JEPA2在时间建模上更均衡可靠。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解不同自监督学习架构在视频动作识别中的性能差异，为选择合适的特征提取方法提供实证指导。

Method: 在UCF Sports数据集上评估两种架构，从分类精度、聚类性能、类内一致性和类间区分度等多个维度分析特征质量。

Result: DINOv3聚类性能更优（轮廓系数0.31 vs 0.21），类间区分度更高（6.16倍分离比），但V-JEPA2在所有动作类型上表现更一致，性能方差更低（0.094 vs 0.288）。

Conclusion: DINOv3的空间处理架构擅长静态姿态识别但在运动依赖动作上表现下降，V-JEPA2的时间建模在不同动作类别间提供更均衡的表示质量，选择应基于任务需求和可靠性约束。

Abstract: This study presents a comprehensive comparative analysis of two prominent
self-supervised learning architectures for video action recognition: DINOv3,
which processes frames independently through spatial feature extraction, and
V-JEPA2, which employs joint temporal modeling across video sequences. We
evaluate both approaches on the UCF Sports dataset, examining feature quality
through multiple dimensions including classification accuracy, clustering
performance, intra-class consistency, and inter-class discrimination. Our
analysis reveals fundamental architectural trade-offs: DINOv3 achieves superior
clustering performance (Silhouette score: 0.31 vs 0.21) and demonstrates
exceptional discrimination capability (6.16x separation ratio) particularly for
pose-identifiable actions, while V-JEPA2 exhibits consistent reliability across
all action types with significantly lower performance variance (0.094 vs
0.288). Through action-specific evaluation, we identify that DINOv3's spatial
processing architecture excels at static pose recognition but shows degraded
performance on motion-dependent actions, whereas V-JEPA2's temporal modeling
provides balanced representation quality across diverse action categories.
These findings contribute to the understanding of architectural design choices
in video analysis systems and provide empirical guidance for selecting
appropriate feature extraction methods based on task requirements and
reliability constraints.

Conclusion: 双架构系统通过自动化生成信息密集的描述，在改善灾害损害评估方面展现出巨大潜力。

Abstract: Immediate damage assessment is essential after natural catastrophes; yet,
conventional hand evaluation techniques are sluggish and perilous. Although
satellite and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) photos offer extensive perspectives
of impacted regions, current computer vision methodologies generally yield just
classification labels or segmentation masks, so constraining their capacity to
deliver a thorough situational comprehension. We introduce the Vision Language
Caption Enhancer (VLCE), a multimodal system designed to produce comprehensive,
contextually-informed explanations of disaster imagery. VLCE employs a
dual-architecture approach: a CNN-LSTM model with a ResNet50 backbone
pretrained on EuroSat satellite imagery for the xBD dataset, and a Vision
Transformer (ViT) model pretrained on UAV pictures for the RescueNet dataset.
Both systems utilize external semantic knowledge from ConceptNet and WordNet to
expand vocabulary coverage and improve description accuracy. We assess VLCE in
comparison to leading vision-language models (LLaVA and QwenVL) utilizing
CLIPScore for semantic alignment and InfoMetIC for caption informativeness.
Experimental findings indicate that VLCE markedly surpasses baseline models,
attaining a maximum of 95.33% on InfoMetIC while preserving competitive
semantic alignment. Our dual-architecture system demonstrates significant
potential for improving disaster damage assessment by automating the production
of actionable, information-dense descriptions from satellite and drone photos.

Motivation: 大型视觉模型在架构和训练范式上差异很大，但缺乏系统方法来识别哪些表征特征是跨家族共享的，哪些反映了独特的计算策略。

Method: 使用多种表征相似性度量（几何、单元调谐、线性可解码性），并采用相似性网络融合（SNF）方法整合这些互补维度。

Result: 几何和调谐度量能有效区分模型家族，而线性预测性度量区分度较弱。SNF融合后实现了比任何单一度量更强的家族分离，聚类分析揭示了监督ResNets和ViTs形成不同簇，而所有自监督模型跨越架构边界聚集在一起。

Conclusion: 该生物学启发的框架为视觉模型提供了原则性分类学，表明新兴计算策略（由架构和训练目标共同塑造）定义了超越表面设计类别的表征结构。

Abstract: Large vision models differ widely in architecture and training paradigm, yet
we lack principled methods to determine which aspects of their representations
are shared across families and which reflect distinctive computational
strategies. We leverage a suite of representational similarity metrics, each
capturing a different facet-geometry, unit tuning, or linear decodability-and
assess family separability using multiple complementary measures. Metrics
preserving geometry or tuning (e.g., RSA, Soft Matching) yield strong family
discrimination, whereas flexible mappings such as Linear Predictivity show
weaker separation. These findings indicate that geometry and tuning carry
family-specific signatures, while linearly decodable information is more
broadly shared. To integrate these complementary facets, we adapt Similarity
Network Fusion (SNF), a method inspired by multi-omics integration. SNF
achieves substantially sharper family separation than any individual metric and
produces robust composite signatures. Clustering of the fused similarity matrix
recovers both expected and surprising patterns: supervised ResNets and ViTs
form distinct clusters, yet all self-supervised models group together across
architectural boundaries. Hybrid architectures (ConvNeXt, Swin) cluster with
masked autoencoders, suggesting convergence between architectural modernization
and reconstruction-based training. This biology-inspired framework provides a
principled typology of vision models, showing that emergent computational
strategies-shaped jointly by architecture and training objective-define
representational structure beyond surface design categories.

*Yixiang Dai,Fan Jiang,Chiyu Wang,Mu Xu,Yonggang Qi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FantasyWorld是一个几何增强框架，通过为冻结的视频基础模型添加可训练的几何分支，实现视频潜在空间和隐式3D场的联合建模，从而生成具有3D感知能力的视频表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频基础模型缺乏明确的3D基础能力，限制了空间一致性和下游3D推理任务的实用性。需要将视频想象力与3D感知能力相结合。

Method: 引入跨分支监督机制，几何线索指导视频生成，视频先验正则化3D预测，在单次前向传播中联合建模视频潜在空间和隐式3D场。

Result: 实验表明FantasyWorld在多视角一致性和风格一致性方面优于现有几何一致基线，能够有效桥接视频想象和3D感知。

Conclusion: 该框架通过统一主干和跨分支信息交换，实现了3D感知视频表示，其几何分支的潜在表示可作为下游3D任务的通用表示，无需逐场景优化或微调。

Abstract: High-quality 3D world models are pivotal for embodied intelligence and
Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), underpinning applications such as AR/VR
content creation and robotic navigation. Despite the established strong
imaginative priors, current video foundation models lack explicit 3D grounding
capabilities, thus being limited in both spatial consistency and their utility
for downstream 3D reasoning tasks. In this work, we present FantasyWorld, a
geometry-enhanced framework that augments frozen video foundation models with a
trainable geometric branch, enabling joint modeling of video latents and an
implicit 3D field in a single forward pass. Our approach introduces
cross-branch supervision, where geometry cues guide video generation and video
priors regularize 3D prediction, thus yielding consistent and generalizable
3D-aware video representations. Notably, the resulting latents from the
geometric branch can potentially serve as versatile representations for
downstream 3D tasks such as novel view synthesis and navigation, without
requiring per-scene optimization or fine-tuning. Extensive experiments show
that FantasyWorld effectively bridges video imagination and 3D perception,
outperforming recent geometry-consistent baselines in multi-view coherence and
style consistency. Ablation studies further confirm that these gains stem from
the unified backbone and cross-branch information exchange.

TL;DR: MORPH是一个形状无关的自回归基础模型，用于处理偏微分方程，能够处理异构的时空数据集，支持不同维度和分辨率的数据，以及混合标量和矢量场。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决科学机器学习中处理异构、多模态数据的挑战，开发一个能够无缝处理不同维度、分辨率和物理场的统一模型。

Method: 基于卷积视觉Transformer架构，结合组件卷积、场间交叉注意力和轴向注意力，通过预训练和微调（包括LoRA）实现高效学习。

Result: MORPH在多个下游预测任务中表现出色，在零样本和全样本泛化方面均优于从头训练的模型，达到或超过现有先进模型。

Conclusion: MORPH为科学机器学习提供了一个灵活强大的基础模型，能够有效处理异构多模态科学观测数据，推动可扩展和数据高效的科学机器学习发展。

Abstract: We introduce MORPH, a shape-agnostic, autoregressive foundation model for
partial differential equations (PDEs). MORPH is built on a convolutional vision
transformer backbone that seamlessly handles heterogeneous spatiotemporal
datasets of varying data dimensionality (1D--3D) at different resolutions,
multiple fields with mixed scalar and vector components. The architecture
combines (i) component-wise convolution, which jointly processes scalar and
vector channels to capture local interactions, (ii) inter-field
cross-attention, which models and selectively propagates information between
different physical fields, (iii) axial attentions, which factorizes full
spatiotemporal self-attention along individual spatial and temporal axes to
reduce computational burden while retaining expressivity. We pretrain multiple
model variants on a diverse collection of heterogeneous PDE datasets and
evaluate transfer to a range of downstream prediction tasks. Using both
full-model fine-tuning and parameter-efficient low-rank adapters (LoRA), MORPH
outperforms models trained from scratch in both zero-shot and full-shot
generalization. Across extensive evaluations, MORPH matches or surpasses strong
baselines and recent state-of-the-art models. Collectively, these capabilities
present a flexible and powerful backbone for learning from heterogeneous and
multimodal nature of scientific observations, charting a path toward scalable
and data-efficient scientific machine learning.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决红外成像在低光照和恶劣天气条件下目标检测面临的类别不平衡、热噪声和计算约束等问题。

Method: 基于YOLOv8，用MobileNetV4替换CSPDarknet主干网络降低计算量，并提出SlideLoss损失函数动态关注欠代表和遮挡样本。

Result: 在FLIR ADAS V2数据集上，MS-YOLO仅需6.7 GFLOPs计算量，达到竞争性mAP和优越精度，计算开销减少1.5%。

Conclusion: MS-YOLO有效解决了保持高检测质量同时最小化计算成本的双重挑战，适合城市环境中的实时边缘部署。

Abstract: Infrared imaging has emerged as a robust solution for urban object detection
under low-light and adverse weather conditions, offering significant advantages
over traditional visible-light cameras. However, challenges such as class
imbalance, thermal noise, and computational constraints can significantly
hinder model performance in practical settings. To address these issues, we
evaluate multiple YOLO variants on the FLIR ADAS V2 dataset, ultimately
selecting YOLOv8 as our baseline due to its balanced accuracy and efficiency.
Building on this foundation, we present \texttt{MS-YOLO} (\textbf{M}obileNetv4
and \textbf{S}lideLoss based on YOLO), which replaces YOLOv8's CSPDarknet
backbone with the more efficient MobileNetV4, reducing computational overhead
by \textbf{1.5%} while sustaining high accuracy. In addition, we introduce
\emph{SlideLoss}, a novel loss function that dynamically emphasizes
under-represented and occluded samples, boosting precision without sacrificing
recall. Experiments on the FLIR ADAS V2 benchmark show that \texttt{MS-YOLO}
attains competitive mAP and superior precision while operating at only
\textbf{6.7 GFLOPs}. These results demonstrate that \texttt{MS-YOLO}
effectively addresses the dual challenge of maintaining high detection quality
while minimizing computational costs, making it well-suited for real-time edge
deployment in urban environments.

TL;DR: 提出MATR框架，通过显式预测物体运动来更新跟踪查询，减少查询冲突，提升多目标跟踪性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DETR-based多目标跟踪方法在单个Transformer解码器层中联合处理检测和跟踪查询，导致冲突和关联精度下降

Method: 引入运动感知Transformer(MATR)，显式预测跨帧物体运动来提前更新跟踪查询，减少查询碰撞

Result: 在DanceTrack上HOTA提升9+点，达到71.3的SOTA；SportsMOT上72.2 HOTA；BDD100k上54.7 mTETA、41.6 mHOTA，均达到SOTA水平

Conclusion: 在端到端Transformer中显式建模运动是提升多目标跟踪性能的简单而有效的方法

Abstract: Multi-object tracking (MOT) in videos remains challenging due to complex
object motions and crowded scenes. Recent DETR-based frameworks offer
end-to-end solutions but typically process detection and tracking queries
jointly within a single Transformer Decoder layer, leading to conflicts and
degraded association accuracy. We introduce the Motion-Aware Transformer
(MATR), which explicitly predicts object movements across frames to update
track queries in advance. By reducing query collisions, MATR enables more
consistent training and improves both detection and association. Extensive
experiments on DanceTrack, SportsMOT, and BDD100k show that MATR delivers
significant gains across standard metrics. On DanceTrack, MATR improves HOTA by
more than 9 points over MOTR without additional data and reaches a new
state-of-the-art score of 71.3 with supplementary data. MATR also achieves
state-of-the-art results on SportsMOT (72.2 HOTA) and BDD100k (54.7 mTETA, 41.6
mHOTA) without relying on external datasets. These results demonstrate that
explicitly modeling motion within end-to-end Transformers offers a simple yet
highly effective approach to advancing multi-object tracking.

TL;DR: DeLiVR是一种高效的视频去雨方法，通过将时空李群微分偏置直接注入网络注意力分数中，实现几何一致的对齐和特征聚合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决野外拍摄视频中常见的雨痕、模糊和噪声问题，以及相机姿态微小变化导致的跨帧不匹配和时间伪影。现有方法依赖光流或启发式对齐，计算成本高且鲁棒性不足。

Method: 提出两个互补组件：1) 旋转有界的李相对偏置，通过紧凑预测模块预测每帧的平面内角度，实现几何一致对齐；2) 微分群位移，计算相邻帧间的角度差异来估计速度，结合时间衰减和注意力掩码关注帧间关系。

Result: 在公开基准测试上进行了广泛实验，证明了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 李群为视频建模中的空间和时间一致性提供了原则性的表示方法，DeLiVR通过注入李群微分偏置有效解决了视频去雨问题。

Abstract: Videos captured in the wild often suffer from rain streaks, blur, and noise.
In addition, even slight changes in camera pose can amplify cross-frame
mismatches and temporal artifacts. Existing methods rely on optical flow or
heuristic alignment, which are computationally expensive and less robust. To
address these challenges, Lie groups provide a principled way to represent
continuous geometric transformations, making them well-suited for enforcing
spatial and temporal consistency in video modeling. Building on this insight,
we propose DeLiVR, an efficient video deraining method that injects
spatiotemporal Lie-group differential biases directly into attention scores of
the network. Specifically, the method introduces two complementary components.
First, a rotation-bounded Lie relative bias predicts the in-plane angle of each
frame using a compact prediction module, where normalized coordinates are
rotated and compared with base coordinates to achieve geometry-consistent
alignment before feature aggregation. Second, a differential group displacement
computes angular differences between adjacent frames to estimate a velocity.
This bias computation combines temporal decay and attention masks to focus on
inter-frame relationships while precisely matching the direction of rain
streaks. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our
method on publicly available benchmarks.

Conclusion: DynaNav通过动态特征和层选择有效解决了视觉导航中的计算效率和可解释性问题，为资源受限场景提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Visual navigation is essential for robotics and embodied AI. However,
existing foundation models, particularly those with transformer decoders,
suffer from high computational overhead and lack interpretability, limiting
their deployment in resource-tight scenarios. To address this, we propose
DynaNav, a Dynamic Visual Navigation framework that adapts feature and layer
selection based on scene complexity. It employs a trainable hard feature
selector for sparse operations, enhancing efficiency and interpretability.
Additionally, we integrate feature selection into an early-exit mechanism, with
Bayesian Optimization determining optimal exit thresholds to reduce
computational cost. Extensive experiments in real-world-based datasets and
simulated environments demonstrate the effectiveness of DynaNav. Compared to
ViNT, DynaNav achieves a 2.26x reduction in FLOPs, 42.3% lower inference time,
and 32.8% lower memory usage, while improving navigation performance across
four public datasets.

TL;DR: 该研究探索了基础AI/ML模型在合成孔径雷达(SAR)目标识别任务中的可行性，通过自监督学习微调公开SSL模型，开发了AFRL-DINOv2模型，在SAR领域取得了新的最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受自然图像领域基础模型成功的启发，研究者希望将这项技术应用于SAR领域，以解决SAR目标识别中标签数据有限、分布偏移鲁棒性和特征可迁移性等挑战。

Method: 首先测试现有视觉基础模型(DINOv2、DINOv3、PE-Core)在SAR任务中的表现，然后使用SAR数据对公开SSL模型进行自监督微调，开发AFRL-DINOv2模型，并分析不同骨干网络和下游任务适应方法的性能权衡。

Result: AFRL-DINOv2模型显著优于当前最佳SAR领域模型SARATR-X，在扩展操作条件和低标签数据等挑战性环境下表现出色，为SAR基础模型设定了新的最先进标准。

Conclusion: 自监督微调是开发SAR基础模型的可行路径，虽然取得了积极成果，但SAR基础模型的开发仍有很长的路要走，希望这项工作能为未来的SAR基础模型构建者提供参考和启发。

Abstract: In this work we investigate the viability of foundational AI/ML models for
Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) object recognition tasks. We are inspired by the
tremendous progress being made in the wider community, particularly in the
natural image domain where frontier labs are training huge models on web-scale
datasets with unprecedented computing budgets. It has become clear that these
models, often trained with Self-Supervised Learning (SSL), will transform how
we develop AI/ML solutions for object recognition tasks - they can be adapted
downstream with very limited labeled data, they are more robust to many forms
of distribution shift, and their features are highly transferable
out-of-the-box. For these reasons and more, we are motivated to apply this
technology to the SAR domain. In our experiments we first run tests with
today's most powerful visual foundational models, including DINOv2, DINOv3 and
PE-Core and observe their shortcomings at extracting semantically-interesting
discriminative SAR target features when used off-the-shelf. We then show that
Self-Supervised finetuning of publicly available SSL models with SAR data is a
viable path forward by training several AFRL-DINOv2s and setting a new
state-of-the-art for SAR foundation models, significantly outperforming today's
best SAR-domain model SARATR-X. Our experiments further analyze the performance
trade-off of using different backbones with different downstream
task-adaptation recipes, and we monitor each model's ability to overcome
challenges within the downstream environments (e.g., extended operating
conditions and low amounts of labeled data). We hope this work will inform and
inspire future SAR foundation model builders, because despite our positive
results, we still have a long way to go.

Abstract: Healthcare robotics requires robust multimodal perception and reasoning to
ensure safety in dynamic clinical environments. Current Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) demonstrate strong general-purpose capabilities but remain limited in
temporal reasoning, uncertainty estimation, and structured outputs needed for

with a SmolAgent-based orchestration layer, it supports chain-of-thought
reasoning, speech-vision fusion, and dynamic tool invocation. The framework
generates structured scene graphs and leverages a hybrid retrieval module for

and a custom clinical dataset show competitive accuracy and improved robustness
compared to state-of-the-art VLMs, demonstrating its potential for applications

Conclusion: UISim为UI测试、快速原型设计和合成数据生成提供了实用价值，并为AI代理的UI导航任务规划等高级应用铺平了道路。

Abstract: Developing and testing user interfaces (UIs) and training AI agents to
interact with them are challenging due to the dynamic and diverse nature of
real-world mobile environments. Existing methods often rely on cumbersome
physical devices or limited static analysis of screenshots, which hinders
scalable testing and the development of intelligent UI agents. We introduce
UISim, a novel image-based UI simulator that offers a dynamic and interactive
platform for exploring mobile phone environments purely from screen images. Our
system employs a two-stage method: given an initial phone screen image and a
user action, it first predicts the abstract layout of the next UI state, then
synthesizes a new, visually consistent image based on this predicted layout.
This approach enables the realistic simulation of UI transitions. UISim
provides immediate practical benefits for UI testing, rapid prototyping, and
synthetic data generation. Furthermore, its interactive capabilities pave the
way for advanced applications, such as UI navigation task planning for AI
agents. Our experimental results show that UISim outperforms end-to-end UI
generation baselines in generating realistic and coherent subsequent UI states,
highlighting its fidelity and potential to streamline UI development and
enhance AI agent training.

Abstract: The ability of robots to interpret human instructions and execute
manipulation tasks necessitates the availability of task-relevant tabletop
scenes for training. However, traditional methods for creating these scenes
rely on time-consuming manual layout design or purely randomized layouts, which
are limited in terms of plausibility or alignment with the tasks. In this
paper, we formulate a novel task, namely task-oriented tabletop scene
generation, which poses significant challenges due to the substantial gap
between high-level task instructions and the tabletop scenes. To support
research on such a challenging task, we introduce MesaTask-10K, a large-scale
dataset comprising approximately 10,700 synthetic tabletop scenes with manually
crafted layouts that ensure realistic layouts and intricate inter-object
relations. To bridge the gap between tasks and scenes, we propose a Spatial
Reasoning Chain that decomposes the generation process into object inference,
spatial interrelation reasoning, and scene graph construction for the final 3D
layout. We present MesaTask, an LLM-based framework that utilizes this
reasoning chain and is further enhanced with DPO algorithms to generate
physically plausible tabletop scenes that align well with given task
descriptions. Exhaustive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of
MesaTask compared to baselines in generating task-conforming tabletop scenes
with realistic layouts. Project page is at https://mesatask.github.io/

Abstract: Lightweight retinal vessel segmentation is important for the early diagnosis
of vision-threatening and systemic diseases, especially in a real-world

LiteFusion-Attention. This attention module incorporates residual learning
connections, Vision Mamba-inspired dynamics, and modulation-based attention,
enabling the model to capture local and global context efficiently and in a
lightweight manner. LFA-Net offers high performance with 0.11 million
parameters, 0.42 MB memory size, and 4.46 GFLOPs, which make it ideal for

Motivation: 现有方法低估了视觉场景上下文信息在建模个体关系中的重要性，同时忽视了情感标签语义信息对完整理解情感的关键作用。

Method: 包含视觉上下文编码模块（多尺度场景信息编码个体关系）和情感语义编码模块（利用LLM生成情感词典，通过结构化情感树构建语义表示），最后通过相似性感知交互对齐融合视觉和语义信息。

Result: 在三个广泛采用的GER数据集上的实验表明，该方法相比最先进方法实现了有竞争力的性能。

Conclusion: 提出的融合视觉场景上下文和标签引导语义信息的框架有效提升了群体级情感识别性能，证明了视觉和语义信息结合的重要性。

Abstract: Group-level emotion recognition (GER) aims to identify holistic emotions
within a scene involving multiple individuals. Current existed methods
underestimate the importance of visual scene contextual information in modeling
individual relationships. Furthermore, they overlook the crucial role of
semantic information from emotional labels for complete understanding of
emotions. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework that
incorporates visual scene context and label-guided semantic information to
improve GER performance. It involves the visual context encoding module that
leverages multi-scale scene information to diversely encode individual
relationships. Complementarily, the emotion semantic encoding module utilizes
group-level emotion labels to prompt a large language model to generate nuanced
emotion lexicons. These lexicons, in conjunction with the emotion labels, are
then subsequently refined into comprehensive semantic representations through
the utilization of a structured emotion tree. Finally, similarity-aware
interaction is proposed to align and integrate visual and semantic information,
thereby generating enhanced group-level emotion representations and
subsequently improving the performance of GER. Experiments on three widely
adopted GER datasets demonstrate that our proposed method achieves competitive
performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation requires an embodied agent to navigate through
unseen environments, guided by natural language instructions and a continuous
video stream. Recent advances in VLN have been driven by the powerful semantic
understanding of Multimodal Large Language Models. However, these methods
typically rely on explicit semantic memory, such as building textual cognitive
maps or storing historical visual frames. This type of method suffers from
spatial information loss, computational redundancy, and memory bloat, which
impede efficient navigation. Inspired by the implicit scene representation in
human navigation, analogous to the left brain's semantic understanding and the
right brain's spatial cognition, we propose JanusVLN, a novel VLN framework
featuring a dual implicit neural memory that models spatial-geometric and
visual-semantic memory as separate, compact, and fixed-size neural
representations. This framework first extends the MLLM to incorporate 3D prior
knowledge from the spatial-geometric encoder, thereby enhancing the spatial
reasoning capabilities of models based solely on RGB input. Then, the
historical key-value caches from the spatial-geometric and visual-semantic
encoders are constructed into a dual implicit memory. By retaining only the KVs
of tokens in the initial and sliding window, redundant computation is avoided,
enabling efficient incremental updates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
JanusVLN outperforms over 20 recent methods to achieve SOTA performance. For
example, the success rate improves by 10.5-35.5 compared to methods using
multiple data types as input and by 3.6-10.8 compared to methods using more RGB
training data. This indicates that the proposed dual implicit neural memory, as
a novel paradigm, explores promising new directions for future VLN research.

*Yu Li,Da Chang,Xi Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: KG-SAM是一个知识引导的医学图像分割框架，通过整合解剖学先验知识、边界优化和不确定性估计，解决了SAM模型在医学图像应用中的边界模糊、解剖关系建模不足和不确定性量化缺失等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 直接应用SAM模型到医学图像分割存在三个主要挑战：边界模糊、解剖关系建模不足以及缺乏不确定性量化。这些限制阻碍了SAM在临床高风险场景中的可靠应用。

Method: KG-SAM包含三个核心组件：(1)医学知识图谱编码细粒度解剖关系；(2)基于能量的条件随机场确保解剖一致性预测；(3)不确定性感知融合模块提升临床场景可靠性。

Result: 在多中心医学数据集上的实验表明，KG-SAM在前列腺分割上达到82.69%的平均Dice分数，在腹部分割上分别达到MRI 78.05%和CT 79.68%的显著提升。

Conclusion: KG-SAM被证明是一个稳健且可推广的框架，能够有效推进医学图像分割技术的发展，特别是在处理复杂解剖结构和临床高风险场景中表现出色。

Abstract: While the Segment Anything Model (SAM) has achieved remarkable success in
image segmentation, its direct application to medical imaging remains hindered
by fundamental challenges, including ambiguous boundaries, insufficient
modeling of anatomical relationships, and the absence of uncertainty
quantification. To address these limitations, we introduce KG-SAM, a
knowledge-guided framework that synergistically integrates anatomical priors
with boundary refinement and uncertainty estimation. Specifically, KG-SAM
incorporates (i) a medical knowledge graph to encode fine-grained anatomical
relationships, (ii) an energy-based Conditional Random Field (CRF) to enforce
anatomically consistent predictions, and (iii) an uncertainty-aware fusion
module to enhance reliability in high-stakes clinical scenarios. Extensive
experiments across multi-center medical datasets demonstrate the effectiveness
of our approach: KG-SAM achieves an average Dice score of 82.69% on prostate
segmentation and delivers substantial gains in abdominal segmentation, reaching
78.05% on MRI and 79.68% on CT. These results establish KG-SAM as a robust and
generalizable framework for advancing medical image segmentation.

*Lan Chen,Yuchao Gu,Qi Mao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniVid框架通过微调预训练的视频生成模型，使用视觉句子表示各种视觉任务，实现了跨模态和跨数据源的泛化能力，无需任务特定的修改或多源预训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大视觉模型需要跨模态和多源的任务特定预训练，成本高昂且难以扩展到未见任务。本文探索预训练视频生成模型是否能适应多样化的图像和视频任务。

Method: 提出UniVid框架，微调视频扩散变换器来处理各种视觉任务，任务表示为视觉句子，上下文序列定义任务和输出模态。

Result: 尽管仅使用自然视频数据训练，UniVid在跨模态推理（图像和视频混合上下文）和跨源任务（自然到标注数据）上均表现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 预训练视频生成模型有潜力作为视觉建模的可扩展统一基础，理解和生成任务可通过简单反转视觉句子顺序轻松切换。

Abstract: Large language models, trained on extensive corpora, successfully unify
diverse linguistic tasks within a single generative framework. Inspired by
this, recent works like Large Vision Model (LVM) extend this paradigm to vision
by organizing tasks into sequential visual sentences, where visual prompts
serve as the context to guide outputs. However, such modeling requires
task-specific pre-training across modalities and sources, which is costly and
limits scalability to unseen tasks. Given that pre-trained video generation
models inherently capture temporal sequence dependencies, we explore a more
unified and scalable alternative: can a pre-trained video generation model
adapt to diverse image and video tasks? To answer this, we propose UniVid, a
framework that fine-tunes a video diffusion transformer to handle various
vision tasks without task-specific modifications. Tasks are represented as
visual sentences, where the context sequence defines both the task and the
expected output modality. We evaluate the generalization of UniVid from two
perspectives: (1) cross-modal inference with contexts composed of both images
and videos, extending beyond LVM's uni-modal setting; (2) cross-source tasks
from natural to annotated data, without multi-source pre-training. Despite
being trained solely on natural video data, UniVid generalizes well in both
settings. Notably, understanding and generation tasks can easily switch by
simply reversing the visual sentence order in this paradigm. These findings
highlight the potential of pre-trained video generation models to serve as a
scalable and unified foundation for vision modeling. Our code will be released
at https://github.com/CUC-MIPG/UniVid.

*Wenyi Gong,Mieszko Lis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种保持空间完整性的token合并方法，能够在保持空间结构的同时实现token缩减，与现代ViT的空间架构设计兼容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代ViT骨干网络采用空间架构设计（如窗口注意力、相对位置编码等），现有token缩减方法无法保持这些架构依赖的空间结构。

Method: 采用2D缩减策略强制结构化token布局，空间感知合并算法保持相对token位置，以及新颖的每维度最大幅度token表示来保留显著特征。

Result: 在SAM-H上实现1.25倍加速，COCO数据集上仅0.7% mIOU下降；在DeiT-B上实现1.15倍加速，ImageNet上top-1准确率无下降。

Conclusion: 该方法在空间和非空间架构上均取得最先进结果，既可直接使用也可微调，在各种视觉任务中表现优异。

Abstract: Many modern ViT backbones adopt spatial architectural designs, such as window
attention, decomposed relative positional embeddings in SAM, and RoPE in
DINOv3. Such architectures impose new challenges on token reduction, as the
vast majority of existing methods fail to preserve the spatial structure these
architectures depend on. In this paper, we introduce a simple yet effective
token merging method that maintains spatial integrity, enabling seamless
compatibility with spatial architectures. We reconcile two seemingly
conflicting requirements: (i)exploiting the uneven information distribution
across the spatial layout while (ii)preserving the spatial structure
post-merging. Our approach employs (i)a 2D reduction strategy to enforce
structured token layouts, (ii)a spatial-aware merging algorithm that maintains
relative token positions, and (iii)a novel max-magnitude-per-dimension token
representation that preserves salient features. Our method demonstrates strong
performance both off-the-shelf and with fine-tuning, achieving state-of-the-art
results on spatial and non-spatial architectures across various vision tasks.
Specifically, we achieve 1.25x speedup on SAM-H with only 0.7% mIOU drop
evaluated on COCO off-the-shelf, and 1.15x speedup on DeiT-B with no top-1
accuracy drop on ImageNet within just one epoch of fine-tuning.

TL;DR: 提出GASP-ICL框架，无需训练即可增强大型视觉语言模型在多模态深度伪造检测中的能力，通过任务感知知识注入和自适应评分器提升检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在多模态深度伪造检测中存在局限性，难以捕捉细微伪造线索、解决跨模态不一致性以及执行任务对齐检索。

Method: 采用GASP-ICL框架，包含MDD适配的特征提取器检索对齐的图像-文本对，设计图结构泰勒自适应评分器(GSTAS)捕获跨样本关系并传播查询对齐信号。

Result: 在四种伪造类型上的实验表明，GASP-ICL超越了强基线方法，在不进行LVLM微调的情况下实现了性能提升。

Conclusion: GASP-ICL通过保留语义相关性同时注入任务感知知识，有效增强了LVLMs在多模态深度伪造检测中的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Multimodal deepfake detection (MDD) aims to uncover manipulations across
visual, textual, and auditory modalities, thereby reinforcing the reliability
of modern information systems. Although large vision-language models (LVLMs)
exhibit strong multimodal reasoning, their effectiveness in MDD is limited by
challenges in capturing subtle forgery cues, resolving cross-modal
inconsistencies, and performing task-aligned retrieval. To this end, we propose
Guided Adaptive Scorer and Propagation In-Context Learning (GASP-ICL), a
training-free framework for MDD. GASP-ICL employs a pipeline to preserve
semantic relevance while injecting task-aware knowledge into LVLMs. We leverage
an MDD-adapted feature extractor to retrieve aligned image-text pairs and build
a candidate set. We further design the Graph-Structured Taylor Adaptive Scorer
(GSTAS) to capture cross-sample relations and propagate query-aligned signals,
producing discriminative exemplars. This enables precise selection of
semantically aligned, task-relevant demonstrations, enhancing LVLMs for robust
MDD. Experiments on four forgery types show that GASP-ICL surpasses strong
baselines, delivering gains without LVLM fine-tuning.

Result: 在视频动作识别实验中，与最先进方法相比证明了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: ProDA框架能够有效解耦多动作场景中的指定动作，为动作识别提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Action recognition is a fundamental task in video understanding. Existing
methods typically extract unified features to process all actions in one video,
which makes it challenging to model the interactions between different objects
in multi-action scenarios. To alleviate this issue, we explore disentangling
any specified actions from complex scenes as an effective solution. In this
paper, we propose Prompt-guided Disentangled Representation for Action
Recognition (ProDA), a novel framework that disentangles any specified actions
from a multi-action scene. ProDA leverages Spatio-temporal Scene Graphs (SSGs)
and introduces Dynamic Prompt Module (DPM) to guide a Graph Parsing Neural
Network (GPNN) in generating action-specific representations. Furthermore, we
design a video-adapted GPNN that aggregates information using dynamic weights.
Experiments in video action recognition demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach when compared with the state-of-the-art methods. Our code can be found

Abstract: The rise in harmful online content not only distorts public discourse but
also poses significant challenges to maintaining a healthy digital environment.
In response to this, we introduce a multimodal dataset uniquely crafted for
identifying hate in digital content. Central to our methodology is the
innovative application of watermarked, stability-enhanced, stable diffusion
techniques combined with the Digital Attention Analysis Module (DAAM). This
combination is instrumental in pinpointing the hateful elements within images,
thereby generating detailed hate attention maps, which are used to blur these
regions from the image, thereby removing the hateful sections of the image. We
release this data set as a part of the dehate shared task. This paper also
describes the details of the shared task. Furthermore, we present DeHater, a
vision-language model designed for multimodal dehatification tasks. Our
approach sets a new standard in AI-driven image hate detection given textual

Method: 两阶段训练范式：结合带注释轨迹的监督微调和图像感知强化学习优化；创新性地提出轨迹数据构建方法，集成对象级和图像级标注信息；设计具有对象和图像双重奖励函数的图像感知RL策略。

Result: 在多图像定位基准测试中达到最先进性能，跨图像推理任务上获得64.82%的准确率，比之前最佳方法提升1%。

Conclusion: MIRG-RL框架有效解决了多图像推理和定位问题，通过创新的训练方法和奖励建模显著提升了跨图像推理能力。

Abstract: Multi-image reasoning and grounding require understanding complex cross-image
relationships at both object levels and image levels. Current Large Visual
Language Models (LVLMs) face two critical challenges: the lack of cross-image
reasoning capabilities and insufficient cross-image reference reward modeling.
To address these issues, we propose a unified framework - Multi-Image Reasoning
and Grounding with Reinforcement Learning (MIRG-RL). Specifically, our
two-stage training paradigm combines supervised fine-tuning with annotated
trajectories and image-aware reinforcement learning optimization, progressively
developing multi-image reasoning capabilities. Furthermore, we innovatively
propose a method for constructing the trajectory data, which integrates
object-level and image-level annotation information, and use this method to
generate a lightweight reasoning-enhanced dataset. To effectively resolve
cross-image ambiguities, we design an image-aware RL policy with dual reward
functions for objects and images. Experiments demonstrate that MIRG-RL achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in multi-image grounding benchmarks,
attaining 64.82% on cross-image reasoning tasks - exceeding the previous best
method by 1%. The code and dataset have been released at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前视频生成方法在长时程生成中的问题：扩散方法存在时间不一致性和视觉漂移，自回归方法则牺牲视觉细节。

Method: 提出动作引导的可变长度分块机制，基于机器人动作语义上下文划分视频块；引入上下文感知专家混合框架，为每个块自适应激活专门专家。

Result: 实验结果表明该方法在扩展的rollouts中实现了稳定和一致的长时程生成。

Conclusion: LongScape框架有效解决了长时程视频生成的稳定性问题，为高质量具身操作数据生成提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Video-based world models hold significant potential for generating
high-quality embodied manipulation data. However, current video generation
methods struggle to achieve stable long-horizon generation: classical
diffusion-based approaches often suffer from temporal inconsistency and visual
drift over multiple rollouts, while autoregressive methods tend to compromise
on visual detail. To solve this, we introduce LongScape, a hybrid framework
that adaptively combines intra-chunk diffusion denoising with inter-chunk
autoregressive causal generation. Our core innovation is an action-guided,
variable-length chunking mechanism that partitions video based on the semantic
context of robotic actions. This ensures each chunk represents a complete,
coherent action, enabling the model to flexibly generate diverse dynamics. We
further introduce a Context-aware Mixture-of-Experts (CMoE) framework that
adaptively activates specialized experts for each chunk during generation,
guaranteeing high visual quality and seamless chunk transitions. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves stable and consistent
long-horizon generation over extended rollouts. Our code is available at:

Conclusion: MoWM框架通过融合混合世界模型的表示，为具身行动规划提供了有效解决方案，并为未来研究提供了有价值的见解。

Abstract: Embodied action planning is a core challenge in robotics, requiring models to
generate precise actions from visual observations and language instructions.
While video generation world models are promising, their reliance on
pixel-level reconstruction often introduces visual redundancies that hinder
action decoding and generalization. Latent world models offer a compact,
motion-aware representation, but overlook the fine-grained details critical for
precise manipulation. To overcome these limitations, we propose MoWM, a
mixture-of-world-model framework that fuses representations from hybrid world
models for embodied action planning. Our approach uses motion-aware
representations from a latent model as a high-level prior, which guides the
extraction of fine-grained visual features from the pixel space model. This
design allows MoWM to highlight the informative visual details needed for
action decoding. Extensive evaluations on the CALVIN benchmark demonstrate that
our method achieves state-of-the-art task success rates and superior
generalization. We also provide a comprehensive analysis of the strengths of
each feature space, offering valuable insights for future research in embodied
planning. The code is available at: https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/MoWM.

Motivation: 现有的轨迹控制方法要么需要大量训练资源，要么专门为U-Net设计，无法充分利用DiT的优越性能

Method: 1) 前景背景分离指导：使用LLM将用户提示转换为前景和背景提示；2) 提出STD-RoPE位置编码，通过修改前景token的位置嵌入消除跨帧空间差异；3) 通过调节位置嵌入密度实现3D感知轨迹控制

Result: 实验表明该方法在视频质量和轨迹可控性方面优于先前方法

Conclusion: DiTraj为DiT提供了一种简单有效的无训练轨迹控制解决方案，显著提升了轨迹控制的精度和视频生成质量

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiT)-based video generation models with 3D full
attention exhibit strong generative capabilities. Trajectory control represents
a user-friendly task in the field of controllable video generation. However,
existing methods either require substantial training resources or are
specifically designed for U-Net, do not take advantage of the superior
performance of DiT. To address these issues, we propose DiTraj, a simple but
effective training-free framework for trajectory control in text-to-video
generation, tailored for DiT. Specifically, first, to inject the object's
trajectory, we propose foreground-background separation guidance: we use the
Large Language Model (LLM) to convert user-provided prompts into foreground and
background prompts, which respectively guide the generation of foreground and
background regions in the video. Then, we analyze 3D full attention and explore
the tight correlation between inter-token attention scores and position
embedding. Based on this, we propose inter-frame Spatial-Temporal Decoupled
3D-RoPE (STD-RoPE). By modifying only foreground tokens' position embedding,
STD-RoPE eliminates their cross-frame spatial discrepancies, strengthening
cross-frame attention among them and thus enhancing trajectory control.
Additionally, we achieve 3D-aware trajectory control by regulating the density
of position embedding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
outperforms previous methods in both video quality and trajectory
controllability.

Conclusion: 混合检索增强生成为多跳问答提供了实用的零样本解决方案，在准确性、效率和可解释性之间取得了良好平衡。

Abstract: Transformer-based models have advanced the field of question answering, but
multi-hop reasoning, where answers require combining evidence across multiple
passages, remains difficult. This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of
retrieval strategies for multi-hop question answering within a
retrieval-augmented generation framework. We compare cosine similarity, maximal
marginal relevance, and a hybrid method that integrates dense embeddings with
lexical overlap and re-ranking. To further improve retrieval, we adapt the
EfficientRAG pipeline for query optimization, introducing token labeling and
iterative refinement while maintaining efficiency. Experiments on the HotpotQA
dataset show that the hybrid approach substantially outperforms baseline
methods, achieving a relative improvement of 50 percent in exact match and 47
percent in F1 score compared to cosine similarity. Error analysis reveals that
hybrid retrieval improves entity recall and evidence complementarity, while
remaining limited in handling distractors and temporal reasoning. Overall, the
results suggest that hybrid retrieval-augmented generation provides a practical
zero-shot solution for multi-hop question answering, balancing accuracy,
efficiency, and interpretability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有HDR新视角合成方法主要针对静态场景，但现实世界包含动态元素（移动物体、变化光照等），需要更全面的建模方法。

Method: 基于高斯泼溅的HDR-4DGS架构，包含创新的动态色调映射模块，根据时间维度上辐射分布的变化动态调整色调映射函数。

Result: HDR-4DGS在定量性能和视觉保真度方面均优于现有最先进方法，实现了时间辐射一致性和空间准确的颜色转换。

Conclusion: 该方法能够从任意视角和时间实例生成逼真的HDR渲染，解决了动态场景HDR新视角合成的挑战。

Abstract: High Dynamic Range Novel View Synthesis (HDR NVS) seeks to learn an HDR 3D
model from Low Dynamic Range (LDR) training images captured under conventional
imaging conditions. Current methods primarily focus on static scenes,
implicitly assuming all scene elements remain stationary and non-living.
However, real-world scenarios frequently feature dynamic elements, such as
moving objects, varying lighting conditions, and other temporal events, thereby
presenting a significantly more challenging scenario. To address this gap, we
propose a more realistic problem named HDR Dynamic Novel View Synthesis (HDR
DNVS), where the additional dimension ``Dynamic'' emphasizes the necessity of
jointly modeling temporal radiance variations alongside sophisticated 3D
translation between LDR and HDR. To tackle this complex, intertwined challenge,
we introduce HDR-4DGS, a Gaussian Splatting-based architecture featured with an
innovative dynamic tone-mapping module that explicitly connects HDR and LDR
domains, maintaining temporal radiance coherence by dynamically adapting
tone-mapping functions according to the evolving radiance distributions across
the temporal dimension. As a result, HDR-4DGS achieves both temporal radiance
consistency and spatially accurate color translation, enabling photorealistic
HDR renderings from arbitrary viewpoints and time instances. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that HDR-4DGS surpasses existing state-of-the-art
methods in both quantitative performance and visual fidelity. Source code will
be released.

Abstract: Reconstructing detailed hand avatars plays a crucial role in various
applications. While prior works have focused on capturing high-fidelity hand
geometry, they heavily rely on high-resolution multi-view image inputs and
struggle to generalize on low-resolution images. Multi-view image
super-resolution methods have been proposed to enforce 3D view consistency.
These methods, however, are limited to static objects/scenes with fixed
resolutions and are not applicable to articulated deformable hands. In this
paper, we propose SRHand (Super-Resolution Hand), the method for reconstructing
detailed 3D geometry as well as textured images of hands from low-resolution
images. SRHand leverages the advantages of implicit image representation with
explicit hand meshes. Specifically, we introduce a geometric-aware implicit
image function (GIIF) that learns detailed hand prior by upsampling the coarse

hand shapes, our method preserves multi-view and pose consistency among
upsampled hand images, and achieves fine-detailed 3D reconstruction (wrinkles,
nails). In experiments using the InterHand2.6M and Goliath datasets, our method
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art image upsampling methods adapted to

*Janis Keuper,Margret Keuper*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文质疑当前AI生成图像检测研究的局限性，指出过度关注"虚假"图像而忽视"真实"图像的精确定义和数据收集，认为现代智能手机拍摄的照片已使用类似生成模型的算法处理，需要重新思考"真实"图像的概念。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代图像生成模型的普及引发了对犯罪和社会负面影响的担忧，但当前检测方法过度依赖少数老旧的低分辨率"真实"图像数据集，忽视了现代摄影技术已使用神经网络算法处理图像的现实。

Method: 通过分析当前图像检测研究的现状，指出其依赖ImageNet等过时数据集的问题，并论证现代智能手机摄影使用的图像形成算法与"虚假"图像生成器在架构上的相似性。

Result: 发现当前"虚假"图像检测方法的开发和评估存在根本性缺陷，因为它们基于对"真实"图像的过时理解，未能反映现代摄影技术的实际状况。

Conclusion: 需要重新定义"真实"图像的技术概念，创建新的基准数据集，并质疑检测"虚假"图像这一目标本身是否合理，呼吁在该研究领域开展开放讨论。

Abstract: The wide availability and low usability barrier of modern image generation
models has triggered the reasonable fear of criminal misconduct and negative
social implications. The machine learning community has been engaging this
problem with an extensive series of publications proposing algorithmic
solutions for the detection of "fake", e.g. entirely generated or partially
manipulated images. While there is undoubtedly some progress towards technical
solutions of the problem, we argue that current and prior work is focusing too
much on generative algorithms and "fake" data-samples, neglecting a clear
definition and data collection of "real" images. The fundamental question "what
is a real image?" might appear to be quite philosophical, but our analysis
shows that the development and evaluation of basically all current
"fake"-detection methods is relying on only a few, quite old low-resolution
datasets of "real" images like ImageNet. However, the technology for the
acquisition of "real" images, aka taking photos, has drastically evolved over
the last decade: Today, over 90% of all photographs are produced by smartphones
which typically use algorithms to compute an image from multiple inputs (over
time) from multiple sensors. Based on the fact that these image formation
algorithms are typically neural network architectures which are closely related
to "fake"-image generators, we state the position that today, we need to
re-think the concept of "real" images. The purpose of this position paper is to
raise the awareness of the current shortcomings in this active field of
research and to trigger an open discussion whether the detection of "fake"
images is a sound objective at all. At the very least, we need a clear
technical definition of "real" images and new benchmark datasets.

TL;DR: Aes-R1是一个基于强化学习的多模态美学评估框架，通过构建高质量的美学推理数据和联合优化绝对评分与相对排序，提升多模态大语言模型的美学评分和推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型虽然适合图像美学评估，但由于缺乏多模态美学推理数据和美学判断的主观性，难以生成准确的美学判断和可解释的推理过程。

Method: 提出Aes-R1框架：1）AesCoT管道构建和过滤高质量的美学推理数据用于冷启动；2）教导模型在评分前生成结构化解释；3）使用RAPO强化学习算法联合优化绝对评分回归和相对排序。

Result: Aes-R1将骨干模型的平均PLCC/SRCC提升了47.9%/34.8%，超越了同类规模的最先进基线。在有限监督和分布外场景下也表现出稳健的泛化能力。

Conclusion: Aes-R1能够使多模态大语言模型生成有依据的解释和可信的评分，在统一框架中增强了美学评分和推理能力。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are well suited to image aesthetic
assessment, as they can capture high-level aesthetic features leveraging their
cross-modal understanding capacity. However, the scarcity of multimodal
aesthetic reasoning data and the inherently subjective nature of aesthetic
judgment make it difficult for MLLMs to generate accurate aesthetic judgments
with interpretable rationales. To this end, we propose Aes-R1, a comprehensive
aesthetic reasoning framework with reinforcement learning (RL). Concretely,
Aes-R1 integrates a pipeline, AesCoT, to construct and filter high-quality
chain-of-thought aesthetic reasoning data used for cold-start. After teaching
the model to generate structured explanations prior to scoring, we then employ
the Relative-Absolute Policy Optimization (RAPO), a novel RL algorithm that
jointly optimizes absolute score regression and relative ranking order,
improving both per-image accuracy and cross-image preference judgments. Aes-R1
enables MLLMs to generate grounded explanations alongside faithful scores,
thereby enhancing aesthetic scoring and reasoning in a unified framework.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that Aes-R1 improves the backbone's average
PLCC/SRCC by 47.9%/34.8%, surpassing state-of-the-art baselines of similar
size. More ablation studies validate Aes-R1's robust generalization under
limited supervision and in out-of-distribution scenarios.

TL;DR: StableDub是一个视觉配音框架，通过唇部习惯感知建模和遮挡鲁棒合成，解决了传统方法在唇部习惯相似性和遮挡处理方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视觉配音方法存在两个关键缺陷：(1)仅音频驱动无法捕捉说话者特定的唇部习惯；(2)传统盲修复方法在处理遮挡时经常产生视觉伪影。

Method: 基于Stable-Diffusion骨干网络，开发了唇部习惯调制机制，联合建模音视频同步和说话者口面部动态。引入遮挡感知训练策略，通过显式暴露遮挡物体到修复过程中。采用混合Mamba-Transformer架构优化训练效率。

Result: 实验结果表明StableDub在唇部习惯相似性和遮挡鲁棒性方面表现优异，在音频-唇部同步、视频质量和分辨率一致性方面超越其他方法。

Conclusion: StableDub从多个方面扩展了视觉配音方法的适用性，在低资源研究场景中展现出增强的适用性。

Abstract: The visual dubbing task aims to generate mouth movements synchronized with
the driving audio, which has seen significant progress in recent years.
However, two critical deficiencies hinder their wide application: (1)
Audio-only driving paradigms inadequately capture speaker-specific lip habits,
which fail to generate lip movements similar to the target avatar; (2)
Conventional blind-inpainting approaches frequently produce visual artifacts
when handling obstructions (e.g., microphones, hands), limiting practical
deployment. In this paper, we propose StableDub, a novel and concise framework
integrating lip-habit-aware modeling with occlusion-robust synthesis.
Specifically, building upon the Stable-Diffusion backbone, we develop a
lip-habit-modulated mechanism that jointly models phonemic audio-visual
synchronization and speaker-specific orofacial dynamics. To achieve plausible
lip geometries and object appearances under occlusion, we introduce the
occlusion-aware training strategy by explicitly exposing the occlusion objects
to the inpainting process. By incorporating the proposed designs, the model
eliminates the necessity for cost-intensive priors in previous methods, thereby
exhibiting superior training efficiency on the computationally intensive
diffusion-based backbone. To further optimize training efficiency from the
perspective of model architecture, we introduce a hybrid Mamba-Transformer
architecture, which demonstrates the enhanced applicability in low-resource
research scenarios. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that StableDub
achieves superior performance in lip habit resemblance and occlusion
robustness. Our method also surpasses other methods in audio-lip sync, video
quality, and resolution consistency. We expand the applicability of visual
dubbing methods from comprehensive aspects, and demo videos can be found at

TL;DR: Drag4D是一个交互式框架，将物体运动控制集成到文本驱动的3D场景生成中，允许用户为3D对象定义3D轨迹，并将其无缝集成到高质量的3D背景中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的3D场景生成方法缺乏对物体运动的交互控制能力，用户无法灵活定义物体在3D空间中的运动轨迹。

Method: 采用三阶段流程：1) 使用2D高斯泼溅和全景图像增强文本到3D背景生成；2) 通过3D复制粘贴方法将目标对象集成到场景中；3) 使用物理感知对象位置学习和运动条件视频扩散模型实现时间动画。

Result: 实现了用户控制的物体运动与高质量3D背景的协调对齐，有效减轻了运动幻觉问题，确保了视图一致的时间对齐。

Conclusion: Drag4D提供了一个统一的架构，成功实现了在3D场景中对物体运动的交互式控制，展示了协调对齐的用户控制物体运动能力。

Abstract: We introduce Drag4D, an interactive framework that integrates object motion
control within text-driven 3D scene generation. This framework enables users to
define 3D trajectories for the 3D objects generated from a single image,
seamlessly integrating them into a high-quality 3D background. Our Drag4D
pipeline consists of three stages. First, we enhance text-to-3D background
generation by applying 2D Gaussian Splatting with panoramic images and
inpainted novel views, resulting in dense and visually complete 3D
reconstructions. In the second stage, given a reference image of the target
object, we introduce a 3D copy-and-paste approach: the target instance is
extracted in a full 3D mesh using an off-the-shelf image-to-3D model and
seamlessly composited into the generated 3D scene. The object mesh is then
positioned within the 3D scene via our physics-aware object position learning,
ensuring precise spatial alignment. Lastly, the spatially aligned object is
temporally animated along a user-defined 3D trajectory. To mitigate motion
hallucination and ensure view-consistent temporal alignment, we develop a
part-augmented, motion-conditioned video diffusion model that processes
multiview image pairs together with their projected 2D trajectories. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our unified architecture through evaluations
at each stage and in the final results, showcasing the harmonized alignment of
user-controlled object motion within a high-quality 3D background.

TL;DR: Syncphony是一个音频到视频生成模型，通过运动感知损失和音频同步引导技术，能够生成与音频精确同步的380x640分辨率、24fps视频。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到视频和图像到视频生成方法在控制运动时序方面存在局限，而音频提供了与视频运动对齐的时间线索，是时序控制视频生成的有前景条件。

Method: 基于预训练视频骨干网络，引入两个关键组件：运动感知损失（强调高运动区域学习）和音频同步引导（使用视觉对齐的无音频层模型引导全模型）。

Result: 在AVSync15和The Greatest Hits数据集上的实验表明，Syncphony在同步精度和视觉质量方面均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Syncphony通过创新的同步机制成功实现了音频与视频的精细同步，为时序控制的视频生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-video and image-to-video generation have made rapid progress in
visual quality, but they remain limited in controlling the precise timing of
motion. In contrast, audio provides temporal cues aligned with video motion,
making it a promising condition for temporally controlled video generation.
However, existing audio-to-video (A2V) models struggle with fine-grained
synchronization due to indirect conditioning mechanisms or limited temporal
modeling capacity. We present Syncphony, which generates 380x640 resolution,
24fps videos synchronized with diverse audio inputs. Our approach builds upon a
pre-trained video backbone and incorporates two key components to improve
synchronization: (1) Motion-aware Loss, which emphasizes learning at
high-motion regions; (2) Audio Sync Guidance, which guides the full model using
a visually aligned off-sync model without audio layers to better exploit audio
cues at inference while maintaining visual quality. To evaluate
synchronization, we propose CycleSync, a video-to-audio-based metric that
measures the amount of motion cues in the generated video to reconstruct the
original audio. Experiments on AVSync15 and The Greatest Hits datasets
demonstrate that Syncphony outperforms existing methods in both synchronization
accuracy and visual quality. Project page is available at:

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于语言引导的遥感变化检测模型LG-CD，通过自然语言提示引导网络关注感兴趣区域，显著提升变化检测的准确性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于深度学习的方法主要关注单模态视觉信息，而忽略了文本等多模态数据提供的丰富语义信息。

Method: 使用视觉基础模型SAM2作为特征提取器获取多尺度金字塔特征，通过多层适配器微调模型，设计文本融合注意力模块对齐视觉和文本信息，实现视觉-语义融合解码器生成精确变化检测掩码。

Result: 在LEVIR-CD、WHU-CD和SYSU-CD三个数据集上的实验表明，LG-CD始终优于最先进的变化检测方法。

Conclusion: 该方法通过利用多模态信息为实现广义变化检测提供了新的思路。

Abstract: Remote Sensing Change Detection (RSCD) typically identifies changes in land
cover or surface conditions by analyzing multi-temporal images. Currently, most
deep learning-based methods primarily focus on learning unimodal visual
information, while neglecting the rich semantic information provided by
multimodal data such as text. To address this limitation, we propose a novel
Language-Guided Change Detection model (LG-CD). This model leverages natural
language prompts to direct the network's attention to regions of interest,
significantly improving the accuracy and robustness of change detection.
Specifically, LG-CD utilizes a visual foundational model (SAM2) as a feature
extractor to capture multi-scale pyramid features from high-resolution to
low-resolution across bi-temporal remote sensing images. Subsequently,
multi-layer adapters are employed to fine-tune the model for downstream tasks,
ensuring its effectiveness in remote sensing change detection. Additionally, we
design a Text Fusion Attention Module (TFAM) to align visual and textual
information, enabling the model to focus on target change regions using text
prompts. Finally, a Vision-Semantic Fusion Decoder (V-SFD) is implemented,
which deeply integrates visual and semantic information through a
cross-attention mechanism to produce highly accurate change detection masks.
Our experiments on three datasets (LEVIR-CD, WHU-CD, and SYSU-CD) demonstrate
that LG-CD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art change detection methods.
Furthermore, our approach provides new insights into achieving generalized
change detection by leveraging multimodal information.

Conclusion: 建立了一个多功能、可推广的可控图像操作解决方案，支持灵活编辑模式，代码将公开以复现结果。

Abstract: This paper explores image editing under the joint control of text and drag
interactions. While recent advances in text-driven and drag-driven editing have
achieved remarkable progress, they suffer from complementary limitations:
text-driven methods excel in texture manipulation but lack precise spatial
control, whereas drag-driven approaches primarily modify shape and structure
without fine-grained texture guidance. To address these limitations, we propose
a unified diffusion-based framework for joint drag-text image editing,
integrating the strengths of both paradigms. Our framework introduces two key
innovations: (1) Point-Cloud Deterministic Drag, which enhances latent-space
layout control through 3D feature mapping, and (2) Drag-Text Guided Denoising,
dynamically balancing the influence of drag and text conditions during
denoising. Notably, our model supports flexible editing modes - operating with
text-only, drag-only, or combined conditions - while maintaining strong
performance in each setting. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments
demonstrate that our method not only achieves high-fidelity joint editing but
also matches or surpasses the performance of specialized text-only or drag-only
approaches, establishing a versatile and generalizable solution for
controllable image manipulation. Code will be made publicly available to
reproduce all results presented in this work.

Abstract: Aside from common challenges in remote sensing like small, sparse targets and
computation cost limitations, detecting vehicles from UAV images in the Nordic
regions faces strong visibility challenges and domain shifts caused by diverse
levels of snow coverage. Although annotated data are expensive, unannotated
data is cheaper to obtain by simply flying the drones. In this work, we
proposed a sideload-CL-adaptation framework that enables the use of unannotated
data to improve vehicle detection using lightweight models. Specifically, we
propose to train a CNN-based representation extractor through contrastive
learning on the unannotated data in the pretraining stage, and then sideload it
to a frozen YOLO11n backbone in the fine-tuning stage. To find a robust
sideload-CL-adaptation, we conducted extensive experiments to compare various
fusion methods and granularity. Our proposed sideload-CL-adaptation model
improves the detection performance by 3.8% to 9.5% in terms of mAP50 on the NVD
dataset.

Conclusion: IF-V2V方法成功实现了无需反转的高质量视频编辑，能够有效利用现有图像到视频模型，为视觉创意提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Although image editing techniques have advanced significantly, video editing,
which aims to manipulate videos according to user intent, remains an emerging
challenge. Most existing image-conditioned video editing methods either require
inversion with model-specific design or need extensive optimization, limiting
their capability of leveraging up-to-date image-to-video (I2V) models to
transfer the editing capability of image editing models to the video domain. To
this end, we propose IF-V2V, an Inversion-Free method that can adapt
off-the-shelf flow-matching-based I2V models for video editing without
significant computational overhead. To circumvent inversion, we devise Vector
Field Rectification with Sample Deviation to incorporate information from the
source video into the denoising process by introducing a deviation term into
the denoising vector field. To further ensure consistency with the source video
in a model-agnostic way, we introduce Structure-and-Motion-Preserving
Initialization to generate motion-aware temporally correlated noise with
structural information embedded. We also present a Deviation Caching mechanism
to minimize the additional computational cost for denoising vector
rectification without significantly impacting editing quality. Evaluations
demonstrate that our method achieves superior editing quality and consistency
over existing approaches, offering a lightweight plug-and-play solution to
realize visual creativity.

Motivation: 传统多视角计数方法依赖完全监督学习，需要大量标注数据。本研究旨在通过自监督学习减轻对标注数据的依赖。

Method: 使用神经体积渲染学习场景的隐式表示，通过可微分神经渲染重建连续几何形状和复杂视角相关外观。该方法可无缝集成到现有框架中。

Result: 在多个多视角计数基准测试中，SSLCounter不仅达到最先进性能，而且在仅使用70%训练数据时仍能保持竞争性表现，展示了优越的数据效率。

Conclusion: SSLCounter通过自监督学习和神经体积渲染，有效解决了多视角计数中对大规模标注数据的依赖问题，具有出色的数据效率和性能表现。

Abstract: Multi-view counting (MVC) methods have attracted significant research
attention and stimulated remarkable progress in recent years. Despite their
success, most MVC methods have focused on improving performance by following
the fully supervised learning (FSL) paradigm, which often requires large
amounts of annotated data. In this work, we propose SSLCounter, a novel
self-supervised learning (SSL) framework for MVC that leverages neural
volumetric rendering to alleviate the reliance on large-scale annotated
datasets. SSLCounter learns an implicit representation w.r.t. the scene,
enabling the reconstruction of continuous geometry shape and the complex,
view-dependent appearance of their 2D projections via differential neural
rendering. Owing to its inherent flexibility, the key idea of our method can be
seamlessly integrated into exsiting frameworks. Notably, extensive experiments
demonstrate that SSLCounter not only demonstrates state-of-the-art performances
but also delivers competitive performance with only using 70% proportion of
training data, showcasing its superior data efficiency across multiple MVC
benchmarks.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个针对基础模型的对象中心空间推理基准测试，使用合成数据集评估了视觉模型和视觉语言模型在空间定位、空间推理和下游检索任务中的表现，揭示了定位精度与空间理解能力之间的权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大多数基准测试主要关注定位精度，而忽视了模型是否真正理解场景中物体的排列和关系。有效的场景理解不仅需要识别物体，还需要推理它们的相对位置、分组和深度关系。

Method: 使用受控合成数据集，评估了最先进的视觉模型（如GroundingDINO、Florence-2、OWLv2）和大型视觉语言模型（如InternVL、LLaVA、GPT-4o）在三个任务上的表现：空间定位、空间推理和下游检索任务。

Result: 发现了一个稳定的权衡：检测器如GroundingDINO和OWLv2提供精确的边界框但关系推理能力有限，而视觉语言模型如SmolVLM和GPT-4o提供粗略的布局线索和流畅的描述但在细粒度空间上下文方面表现不佳。

Conclusion: 研究强调了定位与真正空间理解之间的差距，指出社区需要开发具有空间感知能力的基础模型。

Abstract: Spatial understanding is a critical capability for vision foundation models.
While recent advances in large vision models or vision-language models (VLMs)
have expanded recognition capabilities, most benchmarks emphasize localization
accuracy rather than whether models capture how objects are arranged and
related within a scene. This gap is consequential; effective scene
understanding requires not only identifying objects, but reasoning about their
relative positions, groupings, and depth. In this paper, we present a
systematic benchmark for object-centric spatial reasoning in foundation models.
Using a controlled synthetic dataset, we evaluate state-of-the-art vision
models (e.g., GroundingDINO, Florence-2, OWLv2) and large VLMs (e.g., InternVL,
LLaVA, GPT-4o) across three tasks: spatial localization, spatial reasoning, and
downstream retrieval tasks. We find a stable trade-off: detectors such as
GroundingDINO and OWLv2 deliver precise boxes with limited relational
reasoning, while VLMs like SmolVLM and GPT-4o provide coarse layout cues and
fluent captions but struggle with fine-grained spatial context. Our study
highlights the gap between localization and true spatial understanding, and
pointing toward the need for spatially-aware foundation models in the
community.

TL;DR: PANICL是一个无需训练的训练框架，通过利用多个上下文图像对来缓解视觉上下文学习中对单一示例的过度依赖问题，从而提高预测的稳定性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉上下文学习(VICL)通常过度依赖单个上下文图像对，导致预测存在偏见和不稳定。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出基于补丁的k近邻视觉上下文学习(PANICL)框架，通过平滑多个上下文对的分配分数来减少偏见，无需额外训练。

Result: 在多种视觉任务上的实验表明，PANICL相比基线方法有持续改进，并对领域转移表现出强鲁棒性，能泛化到其他VICL模型。

Conclusion: PANICL是一个通用且有效的训练免费框架，能显著提高视觉上下文学习的稳定性和泛化能力，具有广泛的适用性。

Abstract: Visual In-Context Learning (VICL) uses input-output image pairs, referred to
as in-context pairs (or examples), as prompts alongside query images to guide
models in performing diverse vision tasks. However, VICL often suffers from
over-reliance on a single in-context pair, which can lead to biased and
unstable predictions. We introduce PAtch-based $k$-Nearest neighbor visual
In-Context Learning (PANICL), a general training-free framework that mitigates
this issue by leveraging multiple in-context pairs. PANICL smooths assignment
scores across pairs, reducing bias without requiring additional training.
Extensive experiments on a variety of tasks, including foreground segmentation,
single object detection, colorization, multi-object segmentation, and keypoint
detection, demonstrate consistent improvements over strong baselines. Moreover,
PANICL exhibits strong robustness to domain shifts, including dataset-level
shift (e.g., from COCO to Pascal) and label-space shift (e.g., FSS-1000), and
generalizes well to other VICL models such as SegGPT, Painter, and LVM,
highlighting its versatility and broad applicability.

transparent or highly reflective materials. In the meantime, RGB-based
solutions provide less robust matching performance in low-light and
texture-less scenes due to the lack of geometry information. Motivated by
these, we propose SingRef6D, a lightweight pipeline requiring only a single RGB
image as a reference, eliminating the need for costly depth sensors, multi-view
image acquisition, or training view synthesis models and neural fields. This
enables SingRef6D to remain robust and capable even under resource-limited
settings where depth or dense templates are unavailable. Our framework
incorporates two key innovations. First, we propose a token-scaler-based
fine-tuning mechanism with a novel optimization loss on top of Depth-Anything
v2 to enhance its ability to predict accurate depth, even for challenging
surfaces. Our results show a 14.41% improvement (in $\delta_{1.05}$) on REAL275
depth prediction compared to Depth-Anything v2 (with fine-tuned head). Second,
benefiting from depth availability, we introduce a depth-aware matching process
that effectively integrates spatial relationships within LoFTR, enabling our
system to handle matching for challenging materials and lighting conditions.
Evaluations of pose estimation on the REAL275, ClearPose, and Toyota-Light
datasets show that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods, achieving a
6.1% improvement in average recall.

### [82] [SemanticControl: A Training-Free Approach for Handling Loosely Aligned Visual Conditions in ControlNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21938)
*Woosung Joung,Daewon Chae,Jinkyu Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了SemanticControl方法，通过自适应抑制视觉条件中与文本提示冲突的部分，同时加强文本指导，有效利用未对齐但语义相关的视觉条件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决ControlNet在视觉条件与文本提示未精确对齐时的局限性，特别是在不常见或想象性场景中，现有方法难以使用语义相关但未对齐的视觉条件。

Method: 首先使用与视觉条件对齐的替代提示进行辅助去噪过程提取注意力掩码，然后在实际目标提示的去噪过程中利用这些掩码来抑制冲突区域并加强文本指导。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在各种视觉条件下（深度图、边缘图、人体骨架）都能在未对齐条件下提升性能，优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: SemanticControl提供了一种无需训练的方法，能够有效利用语义相关但未精确对齐的视觉条件，扩展了ControlNet的应用范围。

Abstract: ControlNet has enabled detailed spatial control in text-to-image diffusion
models by incorporating additional visual conditions such as depth or edge
maps. However, its effectiveness heavily depends on the availability of visual
conditions that are precisely aligned with the generation goal specified by
text prompt-a requirement that often fails in practice, especially for uncommon
or imaginative scenes. For example, generating an image of a cat cooking in a
specific pose may be infeasible due to the lack of suitable visual conditions.
In contrast, structurally similar cues can often be found in more common
settings-for instance, poses of humans cooking are widely available and can
serve as rough visual guides. Unfortunately, existing ControlNet models
struggle to use such loosely aligned visual conditions, often resulting in low
text fidelity or visual artifacts. To address this limitation, we propose
SemanticControl, a training-free method for effectively leveraging misaligned
but semantically relevant visual conditions. Our approach adaptively suppresses
the influence of the visual condition where it conflicts with the prompt, while
strengthening guidance from the text. The key idea is to first run an auxiliary
denoising process using a surrogate prompt aligned with the visual condition
(e.g., "a human playing guitar" for a human pose condition) to extract
informative attention masks, and then utilize these masks during the denoising
of the actual target prompt (e.g., cat playing guitar). Experimental results
demonstrate that our method improves performance under loosely aligned
conditions across various conditions, including depth maps, edge maps, and
human skeletons, outperforming existing baselines. Our code is available at

Conclusion: 通过开发基础评估框架并进行全面的多模态大语言模型评估，这项工作有助于推进多模态大语言模型的情感智能发展。

Abstract: Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved exceptional
performance across diverse tasks, continually surpassing previous expectations
regarding their capabilities. Nevertheless, their proficiency in perceiving
emotions from images remains debated, with studies yielding divergent results
in zero-shot scenarios. We argue that this inconsistency stems partly from
constraints in existing evaluation methods, including the oversight of
plausible responses, limited emotional taxonomies, neglect of contextual
factors, and labor-intensive annotations. To facilitate customized visual
emotion evaluation for MLLMs, we propose an Emotion Statement Judgment task
that overcomes these constraints. Complementing this task, we devise an
automated pipeline that efficiently constructs emotion-centric statements with
minimal human effort. Through systematically evaluating prevailing MLLMs, our
study showcases their stronger performance in emotion interpretation and
context-based emotion judgment, while revealing relative limitations in
comprehending perception subjectivity. When compared to humans, even
top-performing MLLMs like GPT4o demonstrate remarkable performance gaps,
underscoring key areas for future improvement. By developing a fundamental
evaluation framework and conducting a comprehensive MLLM assessment, we hope
this work contributes to advancing emotional intelligence in MLLMs. Project

Conclusion: MultiCrafter通过位置监督、MoE架构和强化学习，有效解决了多主体图像生成中的属性泄漏和偏好对齐问题。

Abstract: Multi-subject image generation aims to synthesize user-provided subjects in a
single image while preserving subject fidelity, ensuring prompt consistency,
and aligning with human aesthetic preferences. However, existing methods,
particularly those built on the In-Context-Learning paradigm, are limited by
their reliance on simple reconstruction-based objectives, leading to both
severe attribute leakage that compromises subject fidelity and failing to align
with nuanced human preferences. To address this, we propose MultiCrafter, a
framework that ensures high-fidelity, preference-aligned generation. First, we
find that the root cause of attribute leakage is a significant entanglement of
attention between different subjects during the generation process. Therefore,
we introduce explicit positional supervision to explicitly separate attention
regions for each subject, effectively mitigating attribute leakage. To enable
the model to accurately plan the attention region of different subjects in
diverse scenarios, we employ a Mixture-of-Experts architecture to enhance the
model's capacity, allowing different experts to focus on different scenarios.
Finally, we design a novel online reinforcement learning framework to align the
model with human preferences, featuring a scoring mechanism to accurately
assess multi-subject fidelity and a more stable training strategy tailored for
the MoE architecture. Experiments validate that our framework significantly
improves subject fidelity while aligning with human preferences better.

Motivation: 现有开放世界部件分割方法通常从2D基础模型转移监督，但无法捕捉内在几何特征，导致表面理解有限、分解不可控和泛化能力不足。

Method: 采用类似SAM的编码器-解码器架构，使用基于triplane的双分支编码器生成空间结构化token；开发模型辅助标注流程，从在线资源中整理500多万个3D形状-部件对。

Conclusion: PartSAM标志着向3D部件理解基础模型迈出的决定性一步，结合可扩展架构和多样化3D数据，实现了新兴的开放世界能力。

Abstract: Segmenting 3D objects into parts is a long-standing challenge in computer
vision. To overcome taxonomy constraints and generalize to unseen 3D objects,
recent works turn to open-world part segmentation. These approaches typically
transfer supervision from 2D foundation models, such as SAM, by lifting
multi-view masks into 3D. However, this indirect paradigm fails to capture
intrinsic geometry, leading to surface-only understanding, uncontrolled
decomposition, and limited generalization. We present PartSAM, the first
promptable part segmentation model trained natively on large-scale 3D data.
Following the design philosophy of SAM, PartSAM employs an encoder-decoder
architecture in which a triplane-based dual-branch encoder produces spatially
structured tokens for scalable part-aware representation learning. To enable
large-scale supervision, we further introduce a model-in-the-loop annotation
pipeline that curates over five million 3D shape-part pairs from online assets,
providing diverse and fine-grained labels. This combination of scalable
architecture and diverse 3D data yields emergent open-world capabilities: with
a single prompt, PartSAM achieves highly accurate part identification, and in a
Segment-Every-Part mode, it automatically decomposes shapes into both surface
and internal structures. Extensive experiments show that PartSAM outperforms
state-of-the-art methods by large margins across multiple benchmarks, marking a
decisive step toward foundation models for 3D part understanding. Our code and
model will be released soon.

Abstract: Image contrast was a fundamental factor in visual perception and played a
vital role in overall image quality. However, most no reference image quality
assessment NR IQA models struggled to accurately evaluate contrast distortions
under diverse real world conditions. In this study, we proposed a deep learning
based framework for blind contrast quality assessment by customizing and
fine-tuning three pre trained architectures, EfficientNet B0, ResNet18, and
MobileNetV2, for perceptual Mean Opinion Score, along with an additional model
built on a Siamese network, which indicated a limited ability to capture
perceptual contrast distortions. Each model is modified with a contrast-aware
regression head and trained end to end using targeted data augmentations on two
benchmark datasets, CID2013 and CCID2014, containing synthetic and authentic
contrast distortions. Performance is evaluated using Pearson Linear Correlation
Coefficient and Spearman Rank Order Correlation Coefficient, which assess the
alignment between predicted and human rated scores. Among these three models,
our customized EfficientNet B0 model achieved state-of-the-art performance with
PLCC = 0.9286 and SRCC = 0.9178 on CCID2014 and PLCC = 0.9581 and SRCC = 0.9369
on CID2013, surpassing traditional methods and outperforming other deep
baselines. These results highlighted the models robustness and effectiveness in
capturing perceptual contrast distortion. Overall, the proposed method
demonstrated that contrast aware adaptation of lightweight pre trained networks
can yield a high performing, scalable solution for no reference contrast
quality assessment suitable for real time and resource constrained
applications.

Motivation: 解决遥感图像中指代表达理解在数据稀缺场景下泛化能力差的问题，传统监督微调方法依赖大量标注数据，在少样本情况下表现不佳。

Method: 提出推理中心强化微调(RFT)范式Geo-R1，采用"先推理后行动"的策略：先生成可解释的推理链分解指代表达，然后利用这些推理结果定位目标对象。

Result: 在三个精心设计的少样本地理空间指代表达基准测试中，Geo-R1持续且显著优于监督微调基线，并展现出强大的跨数据集泛化能力。

Conclusion: Geo-R1通过推理中心的方法有效利用有限标注数据，提升了模型泛化能力和可解释性，为少样本地理空间指代表达理解提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Referring expression understanding in remote sensing poses unique challenges,
as it requires reasoning over complex object-context relationships. While
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on multimodal large language models achieves
strong performance with massive labeled datasets, they struggle in data-scarce
scenarios, leading to poor generalization. To address this limitation, we
propose Geo-R1, a reasoning-centric reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) paradigm
for few-shot geospatial referring. Geo-R1 enforces the model to first generate
explicit, interpretable reasoning chains that decompose referring expressions,
and then leverage these rationales to localize target objects. This "reason
first, then act" process enables the model to make more effective use of
limited annotations, enhances generalization, and provides interpretability. We
validate Geo-R1 on three carefully designed few-shot geospatial referring
benchmarks, where our model consistently and substantially outperforms SFT
baselines. It also demonstrates strong cross-dataset generalization,
highlighting its robustness. Code and data will be released at

Motivation: 视觉语言模型在临床工作流程中日益普及，但它们经常表现出奉承行为，优先考虑与用户措辞、社交线索或感知权威的一致性，而非基于证据的推理。

Method: 构建医疗奉承数据集，使用心理学驱动的压力模板进行对抗实验，提出VIPER框架过滤非证据性内容并生成基于证据的答案。

Conclusion: 该基准分析和缓解框架为医疗VLM在真实临床交互中的稳健部署奠定了基础，强调了对证据锚定防御的需求。

Abstract: Vision language models(VLMs) are increasingly integrated into clinical
workflows, but they often exhibit sycophantic behavior prioritizing alignment
with user phrasing social cues or perceived authority over evidence based
reasoning. This study evaluate clinical sycophancy in medical visual question
answering through a novel clinically grounded benchmark. We propose a medical
sycophancy dataset construct from PathVQA, SLAKE, and VQA-RAD stratified by
different type organ system and modality. Using psychologically motivated
pressure templates including various sycophancy. In our adversarial experiments
on various VLMs, we found that these models are generally vulnerable,
exhibiting significant variations in the occurrence of adversarial responses,
with weak correlations to the model accuracy or size. Imitation and expert
provided corrections were found to be the most effective triggers, suggesting
that the models possess a bias mechanism independent of visual evidence. To
address this, we propose Visual Information Purification for Evidence based
Response (VIPER) a lightweight mitigation strategy that filters non evidentiary
content for example social pressures and then generates constrained evidence
first answers. This framework reduces sycophancy by an average amount
outperforming baselines while maintaining interpretability. Our benchmark
analysis and mitigation framework lay the groundwork for robust deployment of
medical VLMs in real world clinician interactions emphasizing the need for
evidence anchored defenses.

Conclusion: 通过稳健地将VLMs与人类注意力对齐，GLARIFY为视觉助手提供了可用且直观的交互范式。

Abstract: With the rise in popularity of smart glasses, users' attention has been
integrated into Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to streamline multi-modal
querying in daily scenarios. However, leveraging gaze data to model users'
attention may introduce ambiguity challenges: (1) users' verbal questions
become ambiguous by using pronouns or skipping context, (2) humans' gaze
patterns can be noisy and exhibit complex spatiotemporal relationships with
their spoken questions. Previous works only consider single image as visual
modality input, failing to capture the dynamic nature of the user's attention.
In this work, we introduce GLARIFY, a novel method to leverage spatiotemporal
gaze information to enhance the model's effectiveness in real-world
applications. Initially, we analyzed hundreds of querying samples with the gaze
modality to demonstrate the noisy nature of users' gaze patterns. We then
utilized GPT-4o to design an automatic data synthesis pipeline to generate the
GLARIFY-Ambi dataset, which includes a dedicated chain-of-thought (CoT) process
to handle noisy gaze patterns. Finally, we designed a heatmap module to
incorporate gaze information into cutting-edge VLMs while preserving their
pretrained knowledge. We evaluated GLARIFY using a hold-out test set.
Experiments demonstrate that GLARIFY significantly outperforms baselines. By
robustly aligning VLMs with human attention, GLARIFY paves the way for a usable
and intuitive interaction paradigm with a visual assistant.

Method: 通过精心设计的探测数据集分析模型空间偏见，发现问题源于位置嵌入不平衡。提出平衡位置分配方法，为所有图像标记分配相同的位置嵌入。

Result: 实验表明BaPA方法无需重新训练即可增强LVLMs的空间鲁棒性，结合轻量微调还能提升多种多模态基准测试性能。信息流分析显示BaPA产生更平衡的注意力分布。

Conclusion: LVLMs的空间偏见主要源于位置嵌入设计不平衡，BaPA方法能有效缓解这一问题，促进更全面的视觉理解。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved remarkable success across
a wide range of multimodal tasks, yet their robustness to spatial variations
remains insufficiently understood. In this work, we present a systematic study
of the spatial bias of LVLMs, focusing on how models respond when identical key
visual information is placed at different locations within an image. Through a
carefully designed probing dataset, we demonstrate that current LVLMs often
produce inconsistent outputs under such spatial shifts, revealing a fundamental
limitation in their spatial-semantic understanding. Further analysis shows that
this phenomenon originates not from the vision encoder, which reliably
perceives and interprets visual content across positions, but from the
unbalanced design of position embeddings in the language model component. In
particular, the widely adopted position embedding strategies, such as RoPE,
introduce imbalance during cross-modal interaction, leading image tokens at
different positions to exert unequal influence on semantic understanding. To
mitigate this issue, we introduce Balanced Position Assignment (BaPA), a simple
yet effective mechanism that assigns identical position embeddings to all image
tokens, promoting a more balanced integration of visual information. Extensive
experiments show that BaPA enhances the spatial robustness of LVLMs without
retraining and further boosts their performance across diverse multimodal
benchmarks when combined with lightweight fine-tuning. Further analysis of
information flow reveals that BaPA yields balanced attention, enabling more
holistic visual understanding.

Abstract: We propose a novel approach for disentangling visual and semantic features
from the backbones of pre-trained diffusion models, enabling visual
correspondence in a manner analogous to the well-established semantic
correspondence. While diffusion model backbones are known to encode
semantically rich features, they must also contain visual features to support
their image synthesis capabilities. However, isolating these visual features is
challenging due to the absence of annotated datasets. To address this, we
introduce an automated pipeline that constructs image pairs with annotated
semantic and visual correspondences based on existing subject-driven image
generation datasets, and design a contrastive architecture to separate the two
feature types. Leveraging the disentangled representations, we propose a new
metric, Visual Semantic Matching (VSM), that quantifies visual inconsistencies
in subject-driven image generation. Empirical results show that our approach
outperforms global feature-based metrics such as CLIP, DINO, and
vision--language models in quantifying visual inconsistencies while also
enabling spatial localization of inconsistent regions. To our knowledge, this
is the first method that supports both quantification and localization of
inconsistencies in subject-driven generation, offering a valuable tool for
advancing this task. Project

sets a new state-of-the-art on the MMEB-v2 video benchmark and achieves
superior results in audio and video-to-audio retrieval. Its prompt-aware nature

Conclusion: ERGO通过推理驱动的感知方法有效解决了高分辨率图像处理的计算效率问题，在保持准确性的同时显著提升了推理速度。

Abstract: Efficient processing of high-resolution images is crucial for real-world
vision-language applications. However, existing Large Vision-Language Models
(LVLMs) incur substantial computational overhead due to the large number of
vision tokens. With the advent of "thinking with images" models, reasoning now
extends beyond text to the visual domain. This capability motivates our
two-stage "coarse-to-fine" reasoning pipeline: first, a downsampled image is
analyzed to identify task-relevant regions; then, only these regions are
cropped at full resolution and processed in a subsequent reasoning stage. This
approach reduces computational cost while preserving fine-grained visual
details where necessary. A major challenge lies in inferring which regions are
truly relevant to a given query. Recent related methods often fail in the first
stage after input-image downsampling, due to perception-driven reasoning, where
clear visual information is required for effective reasoning. To address this
issue, we propose ERGO (Efficient Reasoning & Guided Observation) that performs
reasoning-driven perception-leveraging multimodal context to determine where to
focus. Our model can account for perceptual uncertainty, expanding the cropped
region to cover visually ambiguous areas for answering questions. To this end,
we develop simple yet effective reward components in a reinforcement learning
framework for coarse-to-fine perception. Across multiple datasets, our approach
delivers higher accuracy than the original model and competitive methods, with
greater efficiency. For instance, ERGO surpasses Qwen2.5-VL-7B on the V*
benchmark by 4.7 points while using only 23% of the vision tokens, achieving a

### [94] [DualFocus: Depth from Focus with Spatio-Focal Dual Variational Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21992)
*Sungmin Woo,Sangyoun Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DualFocus是一个新颖的深度聚焦框架，通过联合建模空间和焦距维度的焦点变化，利用变分公式和双约束来提高复杂场景下的深度估计精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的学习型深度聚焦方法在复杂场景（如精细纹理或深度突变区域）中表现不佳，因为焦点线索可能变得模糊或误导。

Method: 提出DualFocus框架，利用焦距堆栈中由焦点变化引起的独特梯度模式，引入具有空间约束和焦距约束的变分公式。空间约束利用不同焦点级别的梯度模式变化来区分真实深度边缘和纹理伪影，焦距约束强制单峰、单调的焦点概率与物理焦点行为一致。

Result: 在四个公共数据集上的综合实验表明，DualFocus在深度精度和感知质量方面始终优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: DualFocus通过引入针对深度聚焦的双约束变分公式，显著提高了在挑战性区域中的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: Depth-from-Focus (DFF) enables precise depth estimation by analyzing focus
cues across a stack of images captured at varying focal lengths. While recent
learning-based approaches have advanced this field, they often struggle in
complex scenes with fine textures or abrupt depth changes, where focus cues may
become ambiguous or misleading. We present DualFocus, a novel DFF framework
that leverages the focal stack's unique gradient patterns induced by focus
variation, jointly modeling focus changes over spatial and focal dimensions.
Our approach introduces a variational formulation with dual constraints
tailored to DFF: spatial constraints exploit gradient pattern changes across
focus levels to distinguish true depth edges from texture artifacts, while
focal constraints enforce unimodal, monotonic focus probabilities aligned with
physical focus behavior. These inductive biases improve robustness and accuracy
in challenging regions. Comprehensive experiments on four public datasets
demonstrate that DualFocus consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in
both depth accuracy and perceptual quality.

TL;DR: 提出了RDcomm框架，通过信息论方法优化多智能体协作感知中的性能-通信权衡，在保持高精度的同时大幅降低通信量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有协作感知研究缺乏理论基础，特别是在任务性能与通信量权衡方面的理论支撑。

Method: 基于信息论提出实用的率失真理论，开发RDcomm框架，包含任务熵离散编码和互信息驱动的消息选择两个关键技术。

Result: 在3D目标检测和BEV分割任务上，在DAIR-V2X和OPV2V数据集上达到SOTA精度，同时通信量减少高达108倍。

Conclusion: 该工作为多智能体协作感知提供了理论基础，并展示了在实际应用中实现高效通信的可行性。

Abstract: Collaborative perception emphasizes enhancing environmental understanding by
enabling multiple agents to share visual information with limited bandwidth
resources. While prior work has explored the empirical trade-off between task
performance and communication volume, a significant gap remains in the
theoretical foundation. To fill this gap, we draw on information theory and
introduce a pragmatic rate-distortion theory for multi-agent collaboration,
specifically formulated to analyze performance-communication trade-off in
goal-oriented multi-agent systems. This theory concretizes two key conditions
for designing optimal communication strategies: supplying pragmatically
relevant information and transmitting redundancy-less messages. Guided by these
two conditions, we propose RDcomm, a communication-efficient collaborative
perception framework that introduces two key innovations: i) task entropy
discrete coding, which assigns features with task-relevant codeword-lengths to
maximize the efficiency in supplying pragmatic information; ii)
mutual-information-driven message selection, which utilizes mutual information
neural estimation to approach the optimal redundancy-less condition.
Experiments on 3D object detection and BEV segmentation demonstrate that RDcomm
achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on DAIR-V2X and OPV2V, while reducing
communication volume by up to 108 times. The code will be released.

TL;DR: FailureAtlas是一个主动探索文本到图像模型失败情况的框架，通过结构化搜索最小化失败诱导概念，发现了大量未知错误切片，并揭示了这些失败与训练数据稀缺的关联。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 静态基准测试在比较文本到图像模型时诊断能力有限，难以发现系统性失败的全貌或隔离其根本原因，需要一种主动探索的补充范式。

Method: 将错误发现框架化为对最小化失败诱导概念的结构化搜索，采用新颖的加速技术处理计算爆炸问题，实现大规模失败景观的自主探索和映射。

Result: 在Stable Diffusion模型上发现了超过247,000个先前未知的错误切片，并首次提供了大规模证据表明这些失败与训练数据集中的数据稀缺相关。

Conclusion: FailureAtlas通过提供原则化和可扩展的深度模型审计引擎，建立了一种新的诊断优先方法论，指导开发更稳健的生成式AI。

Abstract: Static benchmarks have provided a valuable foundation for comparing
Text-to-Image (T2I) models. However, their passive design offers limited
diagnostic power, struggling to uncover the full landscape of systematic
failures or isolate their root causes. We argue for a complementary paradigm:
active exploration. We introduce FailureAtlas, the first framework designed to
autonomously explore and map the vast failure landscape of T2I models at scale.
FailureAtlas frames error discovery as a structured search for minimal,
failure-inducing concepts. While it is a computationally explosive problem, we
make it tractable with novel acceleration techniques. When applied to Stable
Diffusion models, our method uncovers hundreds of thousands of previously
unknown error slices (over 247,000 in SD1.5 alone) and provides the first
large-scale evidence linking these failures to data scarcity in the training
set. By providing a principled and scalable engine for deep model auditing,
FailureAtlas establishes a new, diagnostic-first methodology to guide the
development of more robust generative AI. The code is available at

### [97] [Exposing Hallucinations To Suppress Them: VLMs Representation Editing With Generative Anchors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21997)
*Youxu Shi,Suorong Yang,Dong Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练的自监督幻觉缓解方法，通过文本到图像模型将描述投影到视觉空间来放大幻觉信号，使用正负锚点编辑解码器隐藏状态，有效减少多模态大语言模型的幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在视觉语言任务中表现出色，但容易产生与视觉证据不一致的幻觉内容，现有缓解方法通常需要额外微调、手工先验或牺牲信息量和可扩展性。

Method: 引入幻觉放大机制：通过文本到图像模型将描述投影到视觉空间揭示隐含幻觉信号作为负锚点，原始图像作为正锚点，利用这两个锚点编辑解码器隐藏状态，拉近忠实语义表示并推离幻觉方向。

Result: 在多个基准测试中显著减少了对象、属性和关系层面的幻觉，同时基本保持召回率和描述丰富度，例如在CHAIR上使用LLaVA-v1.5-7B实现了超过5%的幻觉减少，并在多种架构上验证了强跨架构泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法无需人工先验或额外训练成本，在幻觉自由描述上几乎不产生副作用，具有鲁棒性和即插即用的实用性。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable success
across diverse vision-language tasks, yet they remain highly susceptible to
hallucinations, producing content that is fluent but inconsistent with visual
evidence. Such hallucinations, spanning objects, attributes, and relations,
persist even in larger models, while existing mitigation approaches often
require additional finetuning, handcrafted priors, or trade-offs that
compromise informativeness and scalability. To address this limitation, we
propose a training-free, self-supervised method for hallucination mitigation.
Our approach introduces a novel hallucination amplification mechanism: a
caption is projected into the visual space via a text-to-image model to reveal
implicit hallucination signals, serving as a negative anchor, while the
original image provides a positive anchor. Leveraging these dual anchors, we
edit decoder hidden states by pulling representations toward faithful semantics
and pushing them away from hallucination directions. This correction requires
no human priors or additional training costs, ensuring both effectiveness and
efficiency. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks show that our
method significantly reduces hallucinations at the object, attribute, and
relation levels while largely preserving recall and caption richness, e.g.,
achieving a hallucination reduction by over 5% using LLaVA-v1.5-7B on CHAIR.
Furthermore, results on diverse architectures, including LLaVA-NEXT-7B,
Cambrian-8B, and InstructBLIP-7B, validate strong cross-architecture
generalization. More importantly, when applied to hallucination-free captions,
our method introduces almost no side effects, underscoring its robustness and
practical plug-and-play applicability. The implementation will be publicly
available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoFFT是一种无需训练的方法，通过模拟人类视觉认知过程来增强视觉语言模型的视觉推理能力，包含多样化样本生成、双重前瞻解码和视觉焦点调整三个迭代阶段。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在处理复杂冗余的视觉输入时容易受到干扰，产生任务无关的推理过程甚至幻觉，因为它们无法在推理过程中精确发现和处理所需区域。

Method: CoFFT方法包含三个迭代阶段：1) 多样化样本生成 - 生成多样化的推理样本来探索潜在推理路径；2) 双重前瞻解码 - 基于视觉焦点和推理进展严格评估样本；3) 视觉焦点调整 - 精确调整视觉焦点到对未来推理最有益的区域。

Result: 在多个基准测试中使用Qwen2.5-VL、InternVL-2.5和Llava-Next模型，实现了3.1-5.8%的持续性能提升，且计算开销可控增加。

Conclusion: CoFFT通过模拟人类视觉认知过程，有效提升了视觉语言模型的视觉推理能力，解决了模型在处理复杂视觉输入时的干扰问题。

Abstract: Despite significant advances in Vision Language Models (VLMs), they remain
constrained by the complexity and redundancy of visual input. When images
contain large amounts of irrelevant information, VLMs are susceptible to
interference, thus generating excessive task-irrelevant reasoning processes or
even hallucinations. This limitation stems from their inability to discover and
process the required regions during reasoning precisely. To address this
limitation, we present the Chain of Foresight-Focus Thought (CoFFT), a novel
training-free approach that enhances VLMs' visual reasoning by emulating human
visual cognition. Each Foresight-Focus Thought consists of three stages: (1)
Diverse Sample Generation: generates diverse reasoning samples to explore
potential reasoning paths, where each sample contains several reasoning steps;
(2) Dual Foresight Decoding: rigorously evaluates these samples based on both
visual focus and reasoning progression, adding the first step of optimal sample
to the reasoning process; (3) Visual Focus Adjustment: precisely adjust visual
focus toward regions most beneficial for future reasoning, before returning to
stage (1) to generate subsequent reasoning samples until reaching the final
answer. These stages function iteratively, creating an interdependent cycle
where reasoning guides visual focus and visual focus informs subsequent
reasoning. Empirical results across multiple benchmarks using Qwen2.5-VL,
InternVL-2.5, and Llava-Next demonstrate consistent performance improvements of
3.1-5.8\% with controllable increasing computational overhead.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 面对面教学互动在教育支持和技能传递中很重要，但计算机视觉领域对此缺乏系统研究，主要原因是缺乏合适的数据集和分析技术。

Method: 构建了包含语音内容、语调、注视、身体动作和视觉上下文的多模态面对面教学数据集，并比较了多模态大语言模型与传统任务特定模型的表现。

Result: 实验表明，多模态大语言模型即使在没有任务特定微调的情况下也优于专门的基线模型。

Conclusion: 多模态大语言模型在理解教学互动方面显示出潜力，有望实现更全面的教学场景理解。

Abstract: Analyzing instructional interactions between an instructor and a learner who
are co-present in the same physical space is a critical problem for educational
support and skill transfer. Yet such face-to-face instructional scenes have not
been systematically studied in computer vision. We identify two key reasons: i)
the lack of suitable datasets and ii) limited analytical techniques. To address
this gap, we present a new egocentric video dataset of face-to-face instruction
and provide ground-truth annotations for two fundamental tasks that serve as a
first step toward a comprehensive understanding of instructional interactions:
procedural step segmentation and conversation-state classification. Using this
dataset, we benchmark multimodal large language models (MLLMs) against
conventional task-specific models. Since face-to-face instruction involves
multiple modalities (speech content and prosody, gaze and body motion, and
visual context), effective understanding requires methods that handle verbal
and nonverbal communication in an integrated manner. Accordingly, we evaluate
recently introduced MLLMs that jointly process images, audio, and text. This
evaluation quantifies the extent to which current machine learning models
understand face-to-face instructional scenes. In experiments, MLLMs outperform
specialized baselines even without task-specific fine-tuning, suggesting their
promise for holistic understanding of instructional interactions.

TL;DR: DAVIS是一个基于扩散模型的音频-视觉分离框架，通过生成式学习方法解决音频-视觉声源分离任务，超越了传统基于掩码的回归方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常将声音分离视为基于掩码的回归问题，但在捕捉复杂数据分布以高质量分离不同类别声音方面存在局限。

Method: 利用去噪扩散概率模型(DDPM)和流匹配(FM)等生成建模范式，在专门的分离U-Net架构中，从噪声分布直接合成分离的声音频谱图，同时以混合音频输入和相关视觉信息为条件。

Result: 在标准AVE和MUSIC数据集上的评估表明，DAVIS的两个变体(DDPM和Flow Matching)在分离质量上都超越了现有方法。

Conclusion: 生成式框架在解决音频-视觉声源分离任务方面具有显著优势，能够为不同声音类别产生高质量的分离结果。

Abstract: We propose DAVIS, a Diffusion-based Audio-VIsual Separation framework that
solves the audio-visual sound source separation task through generative
learning. Existing methods typically frame sound separation as a mask-based
regression problem, achieving significant progress. However, they face
limitations in capturing the complex data distribution required for
high-quality separation of sounds from diverse categories. In contrast, DAVIS
circumvents these issues by leveraging potent generative modeling paradigms,
specifically Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) and the more
recent Flow Matching (FM), integrated within a specialized Separation U-Net
architecture. Our framework operates by synthesizing the desired separated
sound spectrograms directly from a noise distribution, conditioned concurrently
on the mixed audio input and associated visual information. The inherent nature
of its generative objective makes DAVIS particularly adept at producing
high-quality sound separations for diverse sound categories. We present
comparative evaluations of DAVIS, encompassing both its DDPM and Flow Matching
variants, against leading methods on the standard AVE and MUSIC datasets. The
results affirm that both variants surpass existing approaches in separation
quality, highlighting the efficacy of our generative framework for tackling the
audio-visual source separation task.

Method: 使用双域特征耦合器分解特征为局部空间分支和全局频谱分支，引入双傅里叶注意力模块动态融合特征，基于改进的XceptionNet架构

Result: 在多个深度伪造基准测试中达到最先进准确率，特别是在跨数据集和未知操作场景下，同时保持实时可行性

Conclusion: 统一的空间-频谱学习对于鲁棒和可泛化的深度伪造检测具有有效性

Abstract: The increasing realism of content generated by GANs and diffusion models has
made deepfake detection significantly more challenging. Existing approaches
often focus solely on spatial or frequency-domain features, limiting their
generalization to unseen manipulations. We propose the Spectral
Cross-Attentional Network (SpecXNet), a dual-domain architecture for robust
deepfake detection. The core \textbf{Dual-Domain Feature Coupler (DDFC)}
decomposes features into a local spatial branch for capturing texture-level
anomalies and a global spectral branch that employs Fast Fourier Transform to
model periodic inconsistencies. This dual-domain formulation allows SpecXNet to
jointly exploit localized detail and global structural coherence, which are
critical for distinguishing authentic from manipulated images. We also
introduce the \textbf{Dual Fourier Attention (DFA)} module, which dynamically
fuses spatial and spectral features in a content-aware manner. Built atop a
modified XceptionNet backbone, we embed the DDFC and DFA modules within a
separable convolution block. Extensive experiments on multiple deepfake
benchmarks show that SpecXNet achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, particularly
under cross-dataset and unseen manipulation scenarios, while maintaining
real-time feasibility. Our results highlight the effectiveness of unified
spatial-spectral learning for robust and generalizable deepfake detection. To
ensure reproducibility, we released the full code on

Motivation: 现有的大规模重建模型虽然能实现高质量3D渲染，但无法生成材质属性，这在多样光照环境下对真实感渲染至关重要。

Method: 首先微调了一个新的多视角材质扩散模型，基于输入深度和法线图生成多视角PBR图像；然后探索了高斯材质表示，对PBR材质的每个通道进行建模；最后通过点云渲染获取PBR属性。

Conclusion: MGM框架成功生成了带有PBR材质的高质量3D内容，支持动态重光照，为实际渲染应用提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: The increasing demand for 3D assets across various industries necessitates
efficient and automated methods for 3D content creation. Leveraging 3D Gaussian
Splatting, recent large reconstruction models (LRMs) have demonstrated the
ability to efficiently achieve high-quality 3D rendering by integrating
multiview diffusion for generation and scalable transformers for
reconstruction. However, existing models fail to produce the material
properties of assets, which is crucial for realistic rendering in diverse
lighting environments. In this paper, we introduce the Large Material Gaussian
Model (MGM), a novel framework designed to generate high-quality 3D content
with Physically Based Rendering (PBR) materials, ie, albedo, roughness, and
metallic properties, rather than merely producing RGB textures with
uncontrolled light baking. Specifically, we first fine-tune a new multiview
material diffusion model conditioned on input depth and normal maps. Utilizing
the generated multiview PBR images, we explore a Gaussian material
representation that not only aligns with 2D Gaussian Splatting but also models
each channel of the PBR materials. The reconstructed point clouds can then be
rendered to acquire PBR attributes, enabling dynamic relighting by applying
various ambient light maps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the
materials produced by our method not only exhibit greater visual appeal
compared to baseline methods but also enhance material modeling, thereby
enabling practical downstream rendering applications.

Conclusion: 提出的自监督点云补全方法通过多视图增强和Mamba架构的引入，有效克服了现有方法的局限性，实现了优异的补全效果。

Abstract: Point cloud completion aims to reconstruct complete shapes from partial
observations. Although current methods have achieved remarkable performance,
they still have some limitations: Supervised methods heavily rely on ground
truth, which limits their generalization to real-world datasets due to the
synthetic-to-real domain gap. Unsupervised methods require complete point
clouds to compose unpaired training data, and weakly-supervised methods need
multi-view observations of the object. Existing self-supervised methods
frequently produce unsatisfactory predictions due to the limited capabilities
of their self-supervised signals. To overcome these challenges, we propose a
novel self-supervised point cloud completion method. We design a set of novel
self-supervised signals based on multi-view augmentations of the single partial
point cloud. Additionally, to enhance the model's learning ability, we first
incorporate Mamba into self-supervised point cloud completion task, encouraging
the model to generate point clouds with better quality. Experiments on
synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art results.

Conclusion: Refine-Control框架成功解决了边缘设备上条件图像生成模型的部署挑战，在资源效率和生成质量之间取得了良好平衡。

Abstract: Conditional image generation models have achieved remarkable results by
leveraging text-based control to generate customized images. However, the high
resource demands of these models and the scarcity of well-annotated data have
hindered their deployment on edge devices, leading to enormous costs and
privacy concerns, especially when user data is sent to a third party. To
overcome these challenges, we propose Refine-Control, a semi-supervised
distillation framework. Specifically, we improve the performance of the student
model by introducing a tri-level knowledge fusion loss to transfer different
levels of knowledge. To enhance generalization and alleviate dataset scarcity,
we introduce a semi-supervised distillation method utilizing both labeled and
unlabeled data. Our experiments reveal that Refine-Control achieves significant
reductions in computational cost and latency, while maintaining high-fidelity
generation capabilities and controllability, as quantified by comparative
metrics.

Abstract: Material node graphs are programs that generate the 2D channels of procedural
materials, including geometry such as roughness and displacement maps, and
reflectance such as albedo and conductivity maps. They are essential in
computer graphics for representing the appearance of virtual 3D objects
parametrically and at arbitrary resolution. In particular, their directed
acyclic graph structures and intermediate states provide an intuitive
understanding and workflow for interactive appearance modeling. Creating such
graphs is a challenging task and typically requires professional training.
While recent neural program synthesis approaches attempt to simplify this
process, they solely represent graphs as textual programs, failing to capture
the inherently visual-spatial nature of node graphs that makes them accessible
to humans. To address this gap, we present MultiMat, a multimodal program
synthesis framework that leverages large multimodal models to process both
visual and textual graph representations for improved generation of procedural
material graphs. We train our models on a new dataset of production-quality
procedural materials and combine them with a constrained tree search inference
algorithm that ensures syntactic validity while efficiently navigating the
program space. Our experimental results show that our multimodal program
synthesis method is more efficient in both unconditional and conditional graph
synthesis with higher visual quality and fidelity than text-only baselines,
establishing new state-of-the-art performance.

images. Style-GAN provides a structured latent space, DragGAN enables intuitive
image manipulation, and PCA reduces dimensionality and facilitates cross-model
alignment for more streamlined and interpretable exploration of latent spaces.
We apply our techniques to the Animal Faces High Quality (AFHQ) dataset, and
find that our approach of integrating PCA-based dimensionality reduction with
the Drag-GAN framework for image manipulation retains performance while
improving optimization efficiency. Notably, introducing PCA into the latent W+
layers of DragGAN can consistently reduce the total optimization time while
maintaining good visual quality and even boosting the Structural Similarity
Index Measure (SSIM) of the optimized image, particularly in shallower latent
spaces (W+ layers = 3). We also demonstrate capability for aligning images
generated by two StyleGAN models trained on similar but distinct data domains
(AFHQ-Dog and AFHQ-Cat), and show that we can control the latent space of these
aligned images to manipulate the images in an intuitive and interpretable
manner. Our findings highlight the possibility for efficient and interpretable
latent space control for a wide range of image synthesis and editing
applications.

TL;DR: MinerU2.5是一个12亿参数的文档解析视觉语言模型，采用从粗到细的两阶段解析策略，在保持计算效率的同时实现了最先进的识别精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决文档解析中高分辨率输入处理的计算开销问题，同时保持对密集文本、复杂公式和表格等细粒度细节的识别能力。

Method: 采用两阶段解析策略：第一阶段在降采样图像上进行高效布局分析，识别结构元素；第二阶段基于全局布局指导，在原始图像的原生分辨率裁剪区域进行针对性内容识别。

Result: 在多个基准测试中实现了最先进的性能，超越了通用和领域特定模型，同时保持了显著较低的计算开销。

Conclusion: MinerU2.5展示了强大的文档解析能力，通过从粗到细的两阶段策略在计算效率和识别精度之间取得了良好平衡。

Abstract: We introduce MinerU2.5, a 1.2B-parameter document parsing vision-language
model that achieves state-of-the-art recognition accuracy while maintaining
exceptional computational efficiency. Our approach employs a coarse-to-fine,
two-stage parsing strategy that decouples global layout analysis from local
content recognition. In the first stage, the model performs efficient layout
analysis on downsampled images to identify structural elements, circumventing
the computational overhead of processing high-resolution inputs. In the second
stage, guided by the global layout, it performs targeted content recognition on
native-resolution crops extracted from the original image, preserving
fine-grained details in dense text, complex formulas, and tables. To support
this strategy, we developed a comprehensive data engine that generates diverse,
large-scale training corpora for both pretraining and fine-tuning. Ultimately,
MinerU2.5 demonstrates strong document parsing ability, achieving
state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks, surpassing both
general-purpose and domain-specific models across various recognition tasks,
while maintaining significantly lower computational overhead.

TL;DR: 提出了Geo-CoT框架，通过两阶段对齐策略训练RSThinker模型，在遥感分析中实现可验证的多步推理过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在遥感复杂分析任务中表现不佳，因其端到端训练方式跳过了关键推理步骤，导致输出不可验证。

Method: 使用Geo-CoT380k数据集，通过监督微调建立基础认知架构，然后利用组奖励策略优化来改进推理策略。

Result: RSThinker模型在各项任务中显著优于最先进模型，能同时输出最终答案和可验证的分析轨迹。

Conclusion: Geo-CoT框架为地球观测提供了从模糊感知到结构化、可验证推理的具体路径。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in remote sensing often fail at complex
analytical tasks, a limitation stemming from their end-to-end training paradigm
that bypasses crucial reasoning steps and leads to unverifiable outputs. To
address this limitation, we introduce the Perceptually-Grounded Geospatial
Chain-of-Thought (Geo-CoT), a framework that models remote sensing analysis as
a verifiable, multi-step process. We instill this analytical process through a
two-stage alignment strategy, leveraging Geo-CoT380k, the first large-scale
dataset of structured Geo-CoT rationales. This strategy first employs
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to instill the foundational cognitive
architecture, then leverages Group Reward Policy Optimization (GRPO) to refine
the model's reasoning policy towards factual correctness. The resulting model,
RSThinker, outputs both a final answer and its justifying, verifiable
analytical trace. This capability yields dominant performance, significantly
outperforming state-of-the-art models across a comprehensive range of tasks.
The public release of our Geo-CoT380k dataset and RSThinker model upon
publication serves as a concrete pathway from opaque perception towards
structured, verifiable reasoning for Earth Observation.

*Jiayu Ding,Xinpeng Liu,Zhiyi Pan,Shiqiang Long,Ge Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MUSplat是一个免训练框架，将2D开放词汇理解提升到3D高斯泼溅场景，解决了现有方法依赖逐场景训练、单语义设计和跨视图语义不一致的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有主流方法存在三个关键缺陷：(i)依赖昂贵的逐场景重新训练，无法即插即用；(ii)限制性的单语义设计无法表示复杂的多概念语义；(iii)易受跨视图语义不一致影响，破坏最终语义表示。

Method: 利用预训练的2D分割模型生成多粒度2D掩码并提升到3D，估计每个高斯点的前景概率形成初始对象组，使用语义熵和几何不透明度优化模糊边界，通过VLM从最具代表性视角解释对象外观，提取鲁棒的文本特征。

Result: MUSplat将场景适应时间从数小时减少到几分钟，在开放词汇3D对象选择和语义分割基准任务中优于已建立的基于训练的框架，同时解决了它们的单语义限制。

Conclusion: 通过完全放弃特征优化，MUSplat提供了一个高效的免训练解决方案，能够处理复杂的多概念语义，并在保持语义一致性的同时实现开放词汇查询。

Abstract: Lifting 2D open-vocabulary understanding into 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)
scenes is a critical challenge. However, mainstream methods suffer from three
key flaws: (i) their reliance on costly per-scene retraining prevents
plug-and-play application; (ii) their restrictive monosemous design fails to
represent complex, multi-concept semantics; and (iii) their vulnerability to
cross-view semantic inconsistencies corrupts the final semantic representation.
To overcome these limitations, we introduce MUSplat, a training-free framework
that abandons feature optimization entirely. Leveraging a pre-trained 2D
segmentation model, our pipeline generates and lifts multi-granularity 2D masks
into 3D, where we estimate a foreground probability for each Gaussian point to
form initial object groups. We then optimize the ambiguous boundaries of these
initial groups using semantic entropy and geometric opacity. Subsequently, by
interpreting the object's appearance across its most representative viewpoints,
a Vision-Language Model (VLM) distills robust textual features that reconciles
visual inconsistencies, enabling open-vocabulary querying via semantic
matching. By eliminating the costly per-scene training process, MUSplat reduces
scene adaptation time from hours to mere minutes. On benchmark tasks for
open-vocabulary 3D object selection and semantic segmentation, MUSplat
outperforms established training-based frameworks while simultaneously
addressing their monosemous limitations.

TL;DR: UrbanFeel是一个评估多模态大语言模型在城市发展理解和主观环境感知方面性能的综合性基准，包含14.3K个视觉问题，涵盖静态场景感知、时间变化理解和主观环境感知三个维度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 城市发展影响全球一半以上人口，但目前缺乏系统探索城市环境时间演化和主观感知的基准，现有基准在多模态大语言模型城市环境性能评估方面存在局限。

Method: 收集全球11个代表性城市的多时相单视角和全景街景图像，通过空间聚类、基于规则的生成、模型辅助提示和人工标注的混合流程生成高质量问答对。

Result: 评估20个最先进的多模态大语言模型，Gemini-2.5 Pro表现最佳，准确率接近人类专家水平，平均差距仅为1.5%。多数模型在场景理解任务中表现良好，部分模型在像素级变化检测中甚至超越人类标注者，但在需要时间推理的任务中性能显著下降。

Conclusion: 多模态大语言模型在城市发展理解方面具有潜力，特别是在场景理解和主观感知维度可以达到或超越人类水平，但在时间推理方面仍需改进。

Abstract: Urban development impacts over half of the global population, making
human-centered understanding of its structural and perceptual changes essential
for sustainable development. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)
have shown remarkable capabilities across various domains, existing benchmarks
that explore their performance in urban environments remain limited, lacking
systematic exploration of temporal evolution and subjective perception of urban
environment that aligns with human perception. To address these limitations, we
propose UrbanFeel, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the
performance of MLLMs in urban development understanding and subjective
environmental perception. UrbanFeel comprises 14.3K carefully constructed
visual questions spanning three cognitively progressive dimensions: Static
Scene Perception, Temporal Change Understanding, and Subjective Environmental
Perception. We collect multi-temporal single-view and panoramic street-view
images from 11 representative cities worldwide, and generate high-quality
question-answer pairs through a hybrid pipeline of spatial clustering,
rule-based generation, model-assisted prompting, and manual annotation. Through
extensive evaluation of 20 state-of-the-art MLLMs, we observe that Gemini-2.5
Pro achieves the best overall performance, with its accuracy approaching human
expert levels and narrowing the average gap to just 1.5\%. Most models perform
well on tasks grounded in scene understanding. In particular, some models even
surpass human annotators in pixel-level change detection. However, performance
drops notably in tasks requiring temporal reasoning over urban development.
Additionally, in the subjective perception dimension, several models reach
human-level or even higher consistency in evaluating dimension such as
beautiful and safety.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SFUDA方法要么仅利用源模型预测，要么微调大型多模态模型，但都忽略了互补见解和目标数据的潜在结构。

Method: EXCL包含双专家框架（冻结源域模型+预训练视觉语言模型）和检索增强交互优化管道（三阶段：协作检索样本、分别微调专家、强制学习一致性）。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: EXCL方法有效解决了无源域自适应问题，通过双专家协作和检索增强优化实现了优异的性能。

Abstract: Source-Free Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (SFUDA) addresses the realistic
challenge of adapting a source-trained model to a target domain without access
to the source data, driven by concerns over privacy and cost. Existing SFUDA
methods either exploit only the source model's predictions or fine-tune large
multimodal models, yet both neglect complementary insights and the latent
structure of target data. In this paper, we propose the Experts Cooperative
Learning (EXCL). EXCL contains the Dual Experts framework and
Retrieval-Augmentation-Interaction optimization pipeline. The Dual Experts
framework places a frozen source-domain model (augmented with Conv-Adapter) and
a pretrained vision-language model (with a trainable text prompt) on equal
footing to mine consensus knowledge from unlabeled target samples. To
effectively train these plug-in modules under purely unsupervised conditions,
we introduce Retrieval-Augmented-Interaction(RAIN), a three-stage pipeline that
(1) collaboratively retrieves pseudo-source and complex target samples, (2)
separately fine-tunes each expert on its respective sample set, and (3)
enforces learning object consistency via a shared learning result. Extensive
experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach matches
state-of-the-art performance.

Motivation: 基于扩散模型的文本引导图像编辑虽然质量出色，但计算延迟过高，阻碍了实际应用。需要开发能够实现实时编辑的高效框架。

Method: 1. 一步式反演编辑(OSIE)管道，避免昂贵的迭代过程
2. 背景保护(BG-Shield)技术，选择性修改编辑区域特征
3. 稀疏空间交叉注意力(SSCA)机制，抑制语义泄漏到背景

Result: FlashEdit在保持优异背景一致性和结构完整性的同时，编辑时间低于0.2秒，相比之前的多步方法实现了超过150倍的加速。

Conclusion: FlashEdit框架成功解决了扩散模型图像编辑的延迟问题，实现了高质量、实时的文本引导图像编辑，为实际应用铺平了道路。

Abstract: Text-guided image editing with diffusion models has achieved remarkable
quality but suffers from prohibitive latency, hindering real-world
applications. We introduce FlashEdit, a novel framework designed to enable
high-fidelity, real-time image editing. Its efficiency stems from three key
innovations: (1) a One-Step Inversion-and-Editing (OSIE) pipeline that bypasses
costly iterative processes; (2) a Background Shield (BG-Shield) technique that
guarantees background preservation by selectively modifying features only
within the edit region; and (3) a Sparsified Spatial Cross-Attention (SSCA)
mechanism that ensures precise, localized edits by suppressing semantic leakage
to the background. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FlashEdit maintains
superior background consistency and structural integrity, while performing
edits in under 0.2 seconds, which is an over 150$\times$ speedup compared to
prior multi-step methods. Our code will be made publicly available at

TL;DR: 提出了Neural-MedBench，一个紧凑但推理密集的神经学多模态临床推理基准，揭示了现有视觉语言模型在真实临床推理能力上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学基准主要关注分类准确性，导致模型看似熟练但实际在高风险诊断推理中失败，需要专门评估临床推理能力的基准。

Method: 整合多序列MRI扫描、结构化电子健康记录和临床笔记，构建包含鉴别诊断、病灶识别和原理生成三个核心任务的基准，并开发结合LLM评分、临床医生验证和语义相似度度量的混合评分流程。

Result: 对GPT-4o、Claude-4和MedGemma等最先进VLM的系统评估显示，与传统数据集相比性能显著下降，错误分析表明推理失败而非感知错误是主要问题。

Conclusion: 提出双轴评估框架：广度导向的大数据集用于统计泛化，深度导向的紧凑基准（如Neural-MedBench）用于推理保真度，为临床可信AI提供严格且成本效益高的评估方法。

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable
performance on standard medical benchmarks, yet their true clinical reasoning
ability remains unclear. Existing datasets predominantly emphasize
classification accuracy, creating an evaluation illusion in which models appear
proficient while still failing at high-stakes diagnostic reasoning. We
introduce Neural-MedBench, a compact yet reasoning-intensive benchmark
specifically designed to probe the limits of multimodal clinical reasoning in
neurology. Neural-MedBench integrates multi-sequence MRI scans, structured
electronic health records, and clinical notes, and encompasses three core task
families: differential diagnosis, lesion recognition, and rationale generation.
To ensure reliable evaluation, we develop a hybrid scoring pipeline that
combines LLM-based graders, clinician validation, and semantic similarity
metrics. Through systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art VLMs, including
GPT-4o, Claude-4, and MedGemma, we observe a sharp performance drop compared to
conventional datasets. Error analysis shows that reasoning failures, rather
than perceptual errors, dominate model shortcomings. Our findings highlight the
necessity of a Two-Axis Evaluation Framework: breadth-oriented large datasets
for statistical generalization, and depth-oriented, compact benchmarks such as
Neural-MedBench for reasoning fidelity. We release Neural-MedBench at
https://neuromedbench.github.io/ as an open and extensible diagnostic testbed,
which guides the expansion of future benchmarks and enables rigorous yet
cost-effective assessment of clinically trustworthy AI.

Motivation: 传统大规模地图构建方法依赖昂贵的专用数据采集车辆和劳动密集型标注过程，现有卫星方法存在遮挡、数据过时等固有缺陷，以及感知方法向量化效率低导致道路不连续粗糙的问题。

Method: 将车道线表示为离散序列并建立迭代生成策略；提出支持BEV、PV和文本提示的多模态输入灵活架构；开发状态更新策略确保全局连续性和一致性。

Conclusion: UniMapGen通过生成式方法有效解决了大规模地图构建中的关键挑战，代码将公开发布。

Abstract: Large-scale map construction is foundational for critical applications such
as autonomous driving and navigation systems. Traditional large-scale map
construction approaches mainly rely on costly and inefficient special data
collection vehicles and labor-intensive annotation processes. While existing
satellite-based methods have demonstrated promising potential in enhancing the
efficiency and coverage of map construction, they exhibit two major
limitations: (1) inherent drawbacks of satellite data (e.g., occlusions,
outdatedness) and (2) inefficient vectorization from perception-based methods,
resulting in discontinuous and rough roads that require extensive
post-processing. This paper presents a novel generative framework, UniMapGen,
for large-scale map construction, offering three key innovations: (1)
representing lane lines as \textbf{discrete sequence} and establishing an
iterative strategy to generate more complete and smooth map vectors than
traditional perception-based methods. (2) proposing a flexible architecture
that supports \textbf{multi-modal} inputs, enabling dynamic selection among
BEV, PV, and text prompt, to overcome the drawbacks of satellite data. (3)
developing a \textbf{state update} strategy for global continuity and
consistency of the constructed large-scale map. UniMapGen achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the OpenSatMap dataset. Furthermore, UniMapGen
can infer occluded roads and predict roads missing from dataset annotations.
Our code will be released.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法分别处理网格重建和材质分解，难以重建高反射表面，且依赖外部模型先验。需要一种联合优化的统一解决方案。

Method: 基于3D高斯泼溅，联合优化与渲染深度和法线质量相关的属性，提出基于多视角光度变化的新型粗糙度监督策略，结合精心设计的损失和优化过程。

Result: 重建结果与最先进方法相当，产生三角形网格及其关联的材质组件，适用于下游任务。

Conclusion: GS-2M提供了一个有效的统一框架，能够同时处理网格重建和材质分解，对反射表面具有鲁棒性。

Abstract: We propose a unified solution for mesh reconstruction and material
decomposition from multi-view images based on 3D Gaussian Splatting, referred
to as GS-2M. Previous works handle these tasks separately and struggle to
reconstruct highly reflective surfaces, often relying on priors from external
models to enhance the decomposition results. Conversely, our method addresses
these two problems by jointly optimizing attributes relevant to the quality of
rendered depth and normals, maintaining geometric details while being resilient
to reflective surfaces. Although contemporary works effectively solve these
tasks together, they often employ sophisticated neural components to learn
scene properties, which hinders their performance at scale. To further
eliminate these neural components, we propose a novel roughness supervision
strategy based on multi-view photometric variation. When combined with a
carefully designed loss and optimization process, our unified framework
produces reconstruction results comparable to state-of-the-art methods,
delivering triangle meshes and their associated material components for
downstream tasks. We validate the effectiveness of our approach with widely
used datasets from previous works and qualitative comparisons with
state-of-the-art surface reconstruction methods.

Motivation: 虽然基于规则的强化学习在DeepSeek-R1中取得了成功，但在文档分析领域应用较少。许多下游任务可能受益于强化学习的新兴特性，特别是增强的推理能力。

Method: 使用基于规则的强化学习方法，在文档图像分类任务上进行实验，考察了三种不同的分布外场景：分布外图像、未见过的类别和不同模态。

Result: 研究发现强化学习在分布外数据上表现出更好的泛化能力，在三种不同的分布外场景中都取得了良好的效果。

Conclusion: 基于规则的强化学习在文档分析任务中具有潜力，特别是在处理分布外数据时表现出优越的泛化性能。

Abstract: Rule-based reinforcement learning has been gaining popularity ever since
DeepSeek-R1 has demonstrated its success through simple verifiable rewards. In
the domain of document analysis, reinforcement learning is not as prevalent,
even though many downstream tasks may benefit from the emerging properties of
reinforcement learning, particularly the enhanced reason capabilities. We study
the effects of rule-based reinforcement learning with the task of Document
Image Classification which is one of the most commonly studied downstream tasks
in document analysis. We find that reinforcement learning tends to have better
generalisation capabilities to out-of-distritbution data, which we examine in
three different scenarios, namely out-of-distribution images, unseen classes
and different modalities. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SceneSplit是一种针对文本到视频模型的黑盒越狱方法，通过将有害叙述分解为多个看似良性的场景，利用场景组合约束生成空间，从而绕过安全机制生成有害视频。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着文本到视频模型的快速发展，其安全风险日益凸显。虽然已有研究探索了LLMs、VLMs和文本到图像模型的越狱攻击，但文本到视频模型的安全漏洞尚未得到充分研究，存在显著的安全空白。

Method: 提出SceneSplit方法：1）将有害叙述分解为多个单独良性的场景；2）利用场景组合约束生成空间，将输出限制在有害区域；3）通过迭代场景操作绕过安全过滤器；4）使用策略库重用成功攻击模式提高效果。

Result: 在11个安全类别上对T2V模型进行评估，SceneSplit在Luma Ray2上达到77.2%的平均攻击成功率，在Hailuo上达到84.1%，在Veo2上达到78.2%，显著优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: 当前T2V安全机制容易受到利用叙事结构攻击的影响，这项工作为理解和改进T2V模型安全性提供了新的见解。

Abstract: Along with the rapid advancement of numerous Text-to-Video (T2V) models,
growing concerns have emerged regarding their safety risks. While recent
studies have explored vulnerabilities in models like LLMs, VLMs, and
Text-to-Image (T2I) models through jailbreak attacks, T2V models remain largely
unexplored, leaving a significant safety gap. To address this gap, we introduce
SceneSplit, a novel black-box jailbreak method that works by fragmenting a
harmful narrative into multiple scenes, each individually benign. This approach
manipulates the generative output space, the abstract set of all potential
video outputs for a given prompt, using the combination of scenes as a powerful
constraint to guide the final outcome. While each scene individually
corresponds to a wide and safe space where most outcomes are benign, their
sequential combination collectively restricts this space, narrowing it to an
unsafe region and significantly increasing the likelihood of generating a
harmful video. This core mechanism is further enhanced through iterative scene
manipulation, which bypasses the safety filter within this constrained unsafe
region. Additionally, a strategy library that reuses successful attack patterns
further improves the attack's overall effectiveness and robustness. To validate
our method, we evaluate SceneSplit across 11 safety categories on T2V models.
Our results show that it achieves a high average Attack Success Rate (ASR) of
77.2% on Luma Ray2, 84.1% on Hailuo, and 78.2% on Veo2, significantly
outperforming the existing baseline. Through this work, we demonstrate that
current T2V safety mechanisms are vulnerable to attacks that exploit narrative
structure, providing new insights for understanding and improving the safety of
T2V models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为HiGS的动量采样技术，通过整合历史预测信息来提升扩散模型的图像生成质量和效率，无需额外训练或计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在图像生成方面取得了显著进展，但在使用较少神经函数评估次数或较低引导尺度时，输出结果仍可能显得不真实且缺乏细节。

Method: HiGS利用当前预测与过去预测加权平均值之间的差异来引导采样过程，从而生成更真实、细节更丰富的输出。该方法无需额外训练，可直接集成到现有扩散框架中。

Result: 实验表明HiGS在不同模型和架构下都能持续提升图像质量，使用预训练的SiT模型在ImageNet 256×256无引导生成中仅用30步就达到了1.61的FID新纪录。

Conclusion: HiGS作为一种即插即用的增强技术，能够实现更快速度、更高保真度的扩散采样生成。

Abstract: While diffusion models have made remarkable progress in image generation,
their outputs can still appear unrealistic and lack fine details, especially
when using fewer number of neural function evaluations (NFEs) or lower guidance
scales. To address this issue, we propose a novel momentum-based sampling
technique, termed history-guided sampling (HiGS), which enhances quality and
efficiency of diffusion sampling by integrating recent model predictions into
each inference step. Specifically, HiGS leverages the difference between the
current prediction and a weighted average of past predictions to steer the
sampling process toward more realistic outputs with better details and
structure. Our approach introduces practically no additional computation and
integrates seamlessly into existing diffusion frameworks, requiring neither
extra training nor fine-tuning. Extensive experiments show that HiGS
consistently improves image quality across diverse models and architectures and
under varying sampling budgets and guidance scales. Moreover, using a
pretrained SiT model, HiGS achieves a new state-of-the-art FID of 1.61 for
unguided ImageNet generation at 256$\times$256 with only 30 sampling steps
(instead of the standard 250). We thus present HiGS as a plug-and-play
enhancement to standard diffusion sampling that enables faster generation with
higher fidelity.

Result: 在多模态基准测试中，VeloxSeg实现了26%的Dice系数提升，同时GPU吞吐量提高11倍，CPU吞吐量提高48倍。

Conclusion: VeloxSeg成功解决了轻量级3D医学图像分割的效率与鲁棒性平衡问题，通过创新的架构设计在保持低计算成本的同时显著提升了分割性能。

Abstract: Lightweight 3D medical image segmentation remains constrained by a
fundamental "efficiency / robustness conflict", particularly when processing
complex anatomical structures and heterogeneous modalities. In this paper, we
study how to redesign the framework based on the characteristics of
high-dimensional 3D images, and explore data synergy to overcome the fragile
representation of lightweight methods. Our approach, VeloxSeg, begins with a
deployable and extensible dual-stream CNN-Transformer architecture composed of
Paired Window Attention (PWA) and Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma-guided
convolution (JLC). For each 3D image, we invoke a "glance-and-focus" principle,
where PWA rapidly retrieves multi-scale information, and JLC ensures robust
local feature extraction with minimal parameters, significantly enhancing the
model's ability to operate with low computational budget. Followed by an
extension of the dual-stream architecture that incorporates modal interaction
into the multi-scale image-retrieval process, VeloxSeg efficiently models
heterogeneous modalities. Finally, Spatially Decoupled Knowledge Transfer
(SDKT) via Gram matrices injects the texture prior extracted by a
self-supervised network into the segmentation network, yielding stronger
representations than baselines at no extra inference cost. Experimental results
on multimodal benchmarks show that VeloxSeg achieves a 26% Dice improvement,
alongside increasing GPU throughput by 11x and CPU by 48x. Codes are available

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RAPID3是一个无需更新基础生成器的三层次强化学习加速框架，通过步长跳过、缓存重用和稀疏注意力三个轻量级策略头实现DiTs的3倍加速采样，同时保持生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DiTs加速方法要么使用统一启发式策略牺牲质量，要么需要高成本的微调，缺乏零更新基础模型的图像自适应加速方案。

Method: 使用三个独立的策略头（步长跳过、缓存重用、稀疏注意力）观察当前去噪状态，通过GRPO在线训练策略参数，同时使用对抗性判别器增强奖励信号防止奖励攻击。

Result: 在Stable Diffusion 3和FLUX等DiT骨干网络上，RAPID3实现了近3倍的采样加速，同时保持竞争力的生成质量。

Conclusion: RAPID3证明了通过强化学习策略可以在不更新基础生成器的情况下实现高效的图像自适应加速，为DiTs的实际部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) excel at visual generation yet remain hampered
by slow sampling. Existing training-free accelerators - step reduction, feature
caching, and sparse attention - enhance inference speed but typically rely on a
uniform heuristic or a manually designed adaptive strategy for all images,
leaving quality on the table. Alternatively, dynamic neural networks offer
per-image adaptive acceleration, but their high fine-tuning costs limit broader
applicability. To address these limitations, we introduce RAPID3: Tri-Level
Reinforced Acceleration Policies for Diffusion Transformers, a framework that
delivers image-wise acceleration with zero updates to the base generator.
Specifically, three lightweight policy heads - Step-Skip, Cache-Reuse, and
Sparse-Attention - observe the current denoising state and independently decide
their corresponding speed-up at each timestep. All policy parameters are
trained online via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) while the
generator remains frozen. Meanwhile, an adversarially learned discriminator
augments the reward signal, discouraging reward hacking by boosting returns
only when generated samples stay close to the original model's distribution.
Across state-of-the-art DiT backbones, including Stable Diffusion 3 and FLUX,
RAPID3 achieves nearly 3x faster sampling with competitive generation quality.

Abstract: Current Pedestrian Attribute Recognition (PAR) algorithms typically focus on
mapping visual features to semantic labels or attempt to enhance learning by
fusing visual and attribute information. However, these methods fail to fully
exploit attribute knowledge and contextual information for more accurate
recognition. Although recent works have started to consider using attribute
text as additional input to enhance the association between visual and semantic
information, these methods are still in their infancy. To address the above
challenges, this paper proposes the construction of a multi-modal knowledge
graph, which is utilized to mine the relationships between local visual
features and text, as well as the relationships between attributes and
extensive visual context samples. Specifically, we propose an effective
multi-modal knowledge graph construction method that fully considers the
relationships among attributes and the relationships between attributes and
vision tokens. To effectively model these relationships, this paper introduces
a knowledge graph-guided cross-modal hypergraph learning framework to enhance
the standard pedestrian attribute recognition framework. Comprehensive
experiments on multiple PAR benchmark datasets have thoroughly demonstrated the
effectiveness of our proposed knowledge graph for the PAR task, establishing a
strong foundation for knowledge-guided pedestrian attribute recognition. The
source code of this paper will be released on

TL;DR: CircuitSense是一个评估多模态大语言模型在电路图理解方面能力的基准测试，包含8000多个问题，涵盖从组件级原理图到系统级框图的全工程层次。研究发现现有模型在视觉感知任务上表现良好，但在从视觉输入推导符号方程方面存在严重不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工程设计需要从系统规范到组件实现的层次化抽象，这要求在每个层级结合视觉理解和数学推理。虽然多模态大语言模型在自然图像任务上表现出色，但它们在从技术图表中提取数学模型的能力尚未被充分探索。

Method: 提出了CircuitSense基准测试，通过分层合成生成管道创建测试数据，包括基于网格的原理图生成器和自动推导符号方程标签的框图生成器。评估了6个最先进的多模态大语言模型（包括闭源和开源模型）在感知、分析和设计三个工程工作流程上的表现。

Result: 闭源模型在涉及组件识别和拓扑识别的感知任务上达到85%以上的准确率，但在符号推导和分析推理任务上的表现低于19%，揭示了视觉解析和符号推理之间的关键差距。具有更强符号推理能力的模型在设计任务上始终获得更高的准确率。

Conclusion: 数学理解在电路合成中具有基础性作用，符号推理能力是衡量工程能力的关键指标。现有多模态大语言模型在视觉到数学推理方面存在根本性限制。

Abstract: Engineering design operates through hierarchical abstraction from system
specifications to component implementations, requiring visual understanding
coupled with mathematical reasoning at each level. While Multi-modal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) excel at natural image tasks, their ability to extract
mathematical models from technical diagrams remains unexplored. We present
\textbf{CircuitSense}, a comprehensive benchmark evaluating circuit
understanding across this hierarchy through 8,006+ problems spanning
component-level schematics to system-level block diagrams. Our benchmark
uniquely examines the complete engineering workflow: Perception, Analysis, and
Design, with a particular emphasis on the critical but underexplored capability
of deriving symbolic equations from visual inputs. We introduce a hierarchical
synthetic generation pipeline consisting of a grid-based schematic generator
and a block diagram generator with auto-derived symbolic equation labels.
Comprehensive evaluation of six state-of-the-art MLLMs, including both
closed-source and open-source models, reveals fundamental limitations in
visual-to-mathematical reasoning. Closed-source models achieve over 85\%
accuracy on perception tasks involving component recognition and topology
identification, yet their performance on symbolic derivation and analytical
reasoning falls below 19\%, exposing a critical gap between visual parsing and
symbolic reasoning. Models with stronger symbolic reasoning capabilities
consistently achieve higher design task accuracy, confirming the fundamental
role of mathematical understanding in circuit synthesis and establishing
symbolic reasoning as the key metric for engineering competence.

Conclusion: HierLight-YOLO在保持实时效率的同时，有效提升了无人机场景下小目标的检测精度

Abstract: The real-time detection of small objects in complex scenes, such as the
unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) photography captured by drones, has dual
challenges of detecting small targets (<32 pixels) and maintaining real-time
efficiency on resource-constrained platforms. While YOLO-series detectors have
achieved remarkable success in real-time large object detection, they suffer
from significantly higher false negative rates for drone-based detection where
small objects dominate, compared to large object scenarios. This paper proposes
HierLight-YOLO, a hierarchical feature fusion and lightweight model that
enhances the real-time detection of small objects, based on the YOLOv8
architecture. We propose the Hierarchical Extended Path Aggregation Network
(HEPAN), a multi-scale feature fusion method through hierarchical cross-level
connections, enhancing the small object detection accuracy. HierLight-YOLO
includes two innovative lightweight modules: Inverted Residual Depthwise
Convolution Block (IRDCB) and Lightweight Downsample (LDown) module, which
significantly reduce the model's parameters and computational complexity
without sacrificing detection capabilities. Small object detection head is
designed to further enhance spatial resolution and feature fusion to tackle the
tiny object (4 pixels) detection. Comparison experiments and ablation studies
on the VisDrone2019 benchmark demonstrate state-of-the-art performance of
HierLight-YOLO.

Motivation: 遮挡是当前视觉模型在解释复杂密集真实世界图像时面临的重要挑战，需要准确预测物体间的遮挡顺序关系。

Method: 通过向预训练的GPT-4模型提供专门设计的提示和输入图像，使其分析图像并生成顺序预测，然后解析响应构建遮挡矩阵。

Result: 在COCOA和InstaOrder数据集上的评估结果显示，该模型利用语义上下文、视觉模式和常识知识能产生更准确的顺序预测。

Conclusion: 该方法能以零样本方式推理遮挡关系，无需标注训练数据，且易于集成到遮挡处理框架中。

Abstract: Occlusion remains a significant challenge for current vision models to
robustly interpret complex and dense real-world images and scenes. To address
this limitation and to enable accurate prediction of the occlusion order
relationship between objects, we propose leveraging the advanced capability of
a pre-trained GPT-4 model to deduce the order. By providing a specifically
designed prompt along with the input image, GPT-4 can analyze the image and
generate order predictions. The response can then be parsed to construct an
occlusion matrix which can be utilized in assisting with other occlusion
handling tasks and image understanding. We report the results of evaluating the
model on COCOA and InstaOrder datasets. The results show that by using semantic
context, visual patterns, and commonsense knowledge, the model can produce more
accurate order predictions. Unlike baseline methods, the model can reason about
occlusion relationships in a zero-shot fashion, which requires no annotated
training data and can easily be integrated into occlusion handling frameworks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多焦点图像融合方法难以保持清晰的焦点-散焦边界，导致模糊过渡和焦点细节丢失。

Method: 使用梯度域模型获得完整边界的初始融合结果，引入Tenengrad梯度检测提取显著特征，开发基于梯度和互补信息的焦点度量来精炼边界。

Result: 在四个公开数据集上的实验表明，该方法在主观和客观评估中始终优于12种最先进的方法。

Conclusion: 所提出的基于显著边界增强的方法能够生成高质量的融合边界，有效提升多焦点图像融合性能。

Abstract: Multi-focus image fusion (MFIF) aims to yield an all-focused image from
multiple partially focused inputs, which is crucial in applications cover
sur-veillance, microscopy, and computational photography. However, existing
methods struggle to preserve sharp focus-defocus boundaries, often resulting in
blurred transitions and focused details loss. To solve this problem, we propose
a MFIF method based on significant boundary enhancement, which generates
high-quality fused boundaries while effectively detecting focus in-formation.
Particularly, we propose a gradient-domain-based model that can obtain initial
fusion results with complete boundaries and effectively pre-serve the boundary
details. Additionally, we introduce Tenengrad gradient detection to extract
salient features from both the source images and the ini-tial fused image,
generating the corresponding saliency maps. For boundary refinement, we develop
a focus metric based on gradient and complementary information, integrating the
salient features with the complementary infor-mation across images to emphasize
focused regions and produce a high-quality initial decision result. Extensive
experiments on four public datasets demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms 12 state-of-the-art methods in both subjective and objective
evaluations. We have realized codes in https://github.com/Lihyua/GICI

TL;DR: 提出了TDOA方法，通过聚类训练替代模型将动态输出场景转换为静态单输出场景，使用最远标签目标攻击策略提高攻击效果，在动态和静态输出场景中都取得了优异性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决文本对抗攻击方法通常针对静态场景（固定输出标签和预定义标签空间）的问题，需要大量查询受害者模型或替代模型。

Method: 采用基于聚类的替代模型训练方法将动态输出场景转换为静态单输出场景，并提出最远标签目标攻击策略选择偏离模型粗粒度标签最远的对抗向量。

Result: 在4个数据集和8个受害者模型上评估，单次查询最大攻击成功率50.81%，在静态场景中最大ASR达82.68%，在生成式设置中超越先前结果0.64 RDBLEU和0.62 RDchrF。

Conclusion: TDOA方法在动态输出场景中有效，在有限访问条件下具有破坏大型语言模型的强大潜力，同时在传统静态场景中也达到最先进性能。

Abstract: Text adversarial attack methods are typically designed for static scenarios
with fixed numbers of output labels and a predefined label space, relying on
extensive querying of the victim model (query-based attacks) or the surrogate
model (transfer-based attacks). To address this gap, we introduce the Textual
Dynamic Outputs Attack (TDOA) method, which employs a clustering-based
surrogate model training approach to convert the dynamic-output scenario into a
static single-output scenario. To improve attack effectiveness, we propose the
farthest-label targeted attack strategy, which selects adversarial vectors that
deviate most from the model's coarse-grained labels, thereby maximizing
disruption. We extensively evaluate TDOA on four datasets and eight victim
models (e.g., ChatGPT-4o, ChatGPT-4.1), showing its effectiveness in crafting
adversarial examples and its strong potential to compromise large language
models with limited access. With a single query per text, TDOA achieves a
maximum attack success rate of 50.81\%. Additionally, we find that TDOA also
achieves state-of-the-art performance in conventional static output scenarios,
reaching a maximum ASR of 82.68\%. Meanwhile, by conceptualizing translation
tasks as classification problems with unbounded output spaces, we extend the
TDOA framework to generative settings, surpassing prior results by up to 0.64
RDBLEU and 0.62 RDchrF.

Result: 实验表明LTNs能够提升基线分割性能，特别是在训练数据稀缺的情况下效果更明显。

Conclusion: 尽管处于初步阶段，但神经符号方法具有足够的通用性，可以适应并应用于其他医学语义分割任务。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation is a fundamental task in medical image analysis, aiding
medical decision-making by helping radiologists distinguish objects in an
image. Research in this field has been driven by deep learning applications,
which have the potential to scale these systems even in the presence of noise
and artifacts. However, these systems are not yet perfected. We argue that
performance can be improved by incorporating common medical knowledge into the
segmentation model's loss function. To this end, we introduce Logic Tensor
Networks (LTNs) to encode medical background knowledge using first-order logic
(FOL) rules. The encoded rules span from constraints on the shape of the
produced segmentation, to relationships between different segmented areas. We
apply LTNs in an end-to-end framework with a SwinUNETR for semantic
segmentation. We evaluate our method on the task of segmenting the hippocampus
in brain MRI scans. Our experiments show that LTNs improve the baseline
segmentation performance, especially when training data is scarce. Despite
being in its preliminary stages, we argue that neurosymbolic methods are
general enough to be adapted and applied to other medical semantic segmentation
tasks.

Abstract: The rapid progress of visual autoregressive (VAR) models has brought new
opportunities for text-to-image generation, but also heightened safety
concerns. Existing concept erasure techniques, primarily designed for diffusion
models, fail to generalize to VARs due to their next-scale token prediction
paradigm. In this paper, we first propose a novel VAR Erasure framework VARE
that enables stable concept erasure in VAR models by leveraging auxiliary
visual tokens to reduce fine-tuning intensity. Building upon this, we introduce
S-VARE, a novel and effective concept erasure method designed for VAR, which
incorporates a filtered cross entropy loss to precisely identify and minimally
adjust unsafe visual tokens, along with a preservation loss to maintain
semantic fidelity, addressing the issues such as language drift and reduced
diversity introduce by na\"ive fine-tuning. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our approach achieves surgical concept erasure while preserving generation
quality, thereby closing the safety gap in autoregressive text-to-image
generation by earlier methods.

Motivation: 医学图像解剖理解对自动报告生成和手术导航至关重要，但受限于专家标注数据稀缺。现有VLMs在基于参考图像的理解和细粒度定位方面仍有不足。

Method: 首先训练VLM通过参考图像和目标图像之间的相对空间推理识别解剖区域，然后将其空间线索与SAM2的分割能力结合，实现像素级分割。

Result: 在两个分布内和两个分布外数据集上，RAU始终优于SAM2微调基线，提供更准确的分割和更可靠的定位，并展现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: RAU是首个探索VLMs在医学图像中基于参考的解剖结构识别、定位和分割能力的工作，其优异性能凸显了VLM驱动方法在临床工作流程中的潜力。

Abstract: Anatomical understanding through deep learning is critical for automatic
report generation, intra-operative navigation, and organ localization in
medical imaging; however, its progress is constrained by the scarcity of
expert-labeled data. A promising remedy is to leverage an annotated reference
image to guide the interpretation of an unlabeled target. Although recent
vision-language models (VLMs) exhibit non-trivial visual reasoning, their
reference-based understanding and fine-grained localization remain limited. We
introduce RAU, a framework for reference-based anatomical understanding with
VLMs. We first show that a VLM learns to identify anatomical regions through
relative spatial reasoning between reference and target images, trained on a
moderately sized dataset. We validate this capability through visual question
answering (VQA) and bounding box prediction. Next, we demonstrate that the
VLM-derived spatial cues can be seamlessly integrated with the fine-grained
segmentation capability of SAM2, enabling localization and pixel-level
segmentation of small anatomical regions, such as vessel segments. Across two
in-distribution and two out-of-distribution datasets, RAU consistently
outperforms a SAM2 fine-tuning baseline using the same memory setup, yielding
more accurate segmentations and more reliable localization. More importantly,
its strong generalization ability makes it scalable to out-of-distribution
datasets, a property crucial for medical image applications. To the best of our
knowledge, RAU is the first to explore the capability of VLMs for
reference-based identification, localization, and segmentation of anatomical
structures in medical images. Its promising performance highlights the
potential of VLM-driven approaches for anatomical understanding in automated
clinical workflows.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度伪造检测器因从有限训练数据中学习到的偏差而难以泛化到新型伪造类型，特别是频谱偏差导致检测器过度依赖特定频带

Method: 1) Fo-Mixup增强动态多样化训练样本的频率特征；2) 双一致性正则化：局部一致性使用CAM，全局一致性使用vMF分布

Result: FreqDebias显著增强了跨域泛化能力，在跨域和域内设置下均优于最先进方法

Conclusion: 该框架有效缓解了频谱偏差问题，为深度伪造检测提供了更好的泛化性能

Abstract: Deepfake detectors often struggle to generalize to novel forgery types due to
biases learned from limited training data. In this paper, we identify a new
type of model bias in the frequency domain, termed spectral bias, where
detectors overly rely on specific frequency bands, restricting their ability to
generalize across unseen forgeries. To address this, we propose FreqDebias, a
frequency debiasing framework that mitigates spectral bias through two
complementary strategies. First, we introduce a novel Forgery Mixup (Fo-Mixup)
augmentation, which dynamically diversifies frequency characteristics of
training samples. Second, we incorporate a dual consistency regularization
(CR), which enforces both local consistency using class activation maps (CAMs)
and global consistency through a von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution on a
hyperspherical embedding space. This dual CR mitigates over-reliance on certain

*Song Fei,Tian Ye,Lujia Wang,Lei Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LucidFlux是一个无需图像描述的通用图像恢复框架，通过轻量级双分支调节器、自适应调制计划和语义对齐机制，在保持全局结构的同时恢复纹理细节，在各种基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决通用图像恢复中现有方法在未知混合退化条件下容易过度平滑、产生幻觉或语义漂移的问题，特别是避免依赖图像描述带来的延迟和不稳定性。

Method: 采用大型扩散变换器Flux.1，引入轻量级双分支调节器注入退化输入和轻度恢复代理信号，设计时间步和层自适应调制计划，通过SigLIP特征实现无描述的语义对齐，并使用可扩展的数据筛选管道。

Result: 在合成和真实世界基准测试中，LucidFlux始终优于强大的开源和商业基线，消融研究验证了每个组件的必要性。

Conclusion: 对于大型扩散变换器，何时、何地以及如何调节——而不是增加参数或依赖文本提示——是实现鲁棒且无需描述的通用图像恢复的关键因素。

Abstract: Universal image restoration (UIR) aims to recover images degraded by unknown
mixtures while preserving semantics -- conditions under which discriminative
restorers and UNet-based diffusion priors often oversmooth, hallucinate, or
drift. We present LucidFlux, a caption-free UIR framework that adapts a large
diffusion transformer (Flux.1) without image captions. LucidFlux introduces a
lightweight dual-branch conditioner that injects signals from the degraded
input and a lightly restored proxy to respectively anchor geometry and suppress
artifacts. Then, a timestep- and layer-adaptive modulation schedule is designed
to route these cues across the backbone's hierarchy, in order to yield
coarse-to-fine and context-aware updates that protect the global structure
while recovering texture. After that, to avoid the latency and instability of
text prompts or MLLM captions, we enforce caption-free semantic alignment via
SigLIP features extracted from the proxy. A scalable curation pipeline further
filters large-scale data for structure-rich supervision. Across synthetic and
in-the-wild benchmarks, LucidFlux consistently outperforms strong open-source
and commercial baselines, and ablation studies verify the necessity of each
component. LucidFlux shows that, for large DiTs, when, where, and what to
condition on -- rather than adding parameters or relying on text prompts -- is
the governing lever for robust and caption-free universal image restoration in
the wild.

TL;DR: 提出了一种增强多模态大语言模型可解释性的方法，通过多尺度解释聚合和激活排名相关来改进视觉和文本模态的解释质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有可解释性研究主要关注跨模态归因，但忽视了模态内依赖关系，导致视觉解释碎片化、文本解释存在虚假激活

Method: 视觉分支采用多尺度解释聚合动态调整感受野，文本分支使用激活排名相关来抑制无关上下文的虚假激活

Result: 在多个先进MLLM和基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法始终优于现有可解释性方法

Conclusion: 所提方法能产生更忠实和细粒度的模型行为解释，有效解决了模态内依赖关系被忽视的问题

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable success
across diverse vision-language tasks, yet their internal decision-making
mechanisms remain insufficiently understood. Existing interpretability research
has primarily focused on cross-modal attribution, identifying which image
regions the model attends to during output generation. However, these
approaches often overlook intra-modal dependencies. In the visual modality,
attributing importance to isolated image patches ignores spatial context due to
limited receptive fields, resulting in fragmented and noisy explanations. In
the textual modality, reliance on preceding tokens introduces spurious
activations. Failing to effectively mitigate these interference compromises
attribution fidelity. To address these limitations, we propose enhancing
interpretability by leveraging intra-modal interaction. For the visual branch,
we introduce \textit{Multi-Scale Explanation Aggregation} (MSEA), which
aggregates attributions over multi-scale inputs to dynamically adjust receptive
fields, producing more holistic and spatially coherent visual explanations. For
the textual branch, we propose \textit{Activation Ranking Correlation} (ARC),
which measures the relevance of contextual tokens to the current token via
alignment of their top-$k$ prediction rankings. ARC leverages this relevance to
suppress spurious activations from irrelevant contexts while preserving
semantically coherent ones. Extensive experiments across state-of-the-art MLLMs
and benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms
existing interpretability methods, yielding more faithful and fine-grained
explanations of model behavior.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统U-Net架构存在两个主要局限：简单跳跃连接忽略编码器-解码器语义差距，以及深层缺乏多尺度特征提取能力，导致医学图像分割中细节和边界信息丢失。

Method: U-MAN架构包含两个核心模块：PAGF模块用注意力机制替代简单跳跃连接，融合编码器和解码器特征；MAN模块使网络能够自适应处理多尺度特征，提升不同大小对象的分割能力。

Result: 在BUSI、GLAS和CVC三个公开数据集上的实验表明，U-MAN优于现有最先进方法，特别是在定义准确边界和保留精细细节方面表现突出。

Conclusion: U-MAN通过结合注意力机制和多尺度自适应处理，有效解决了医学图像分割中的关键挑战，为复杂解剖结构和病理区域的分割提供了更精确的解决方案。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation faces significant challenges in preserving
fine-grained details and precise boundaries due to complex anatomical
structures and pathological regions. These challenges primarily stem from two
key limitations of conventional U-Net architectures: (1) their simple skip
connections ignore the encoder-decoder semantic gap between various features,
and (2) they lack the capability for multi-scale feature extraction in deep
layers. To address these challenges, we propose the U-Net with Multi-scale
Adaptive KAN (U-MAN), a novel architecture that enhances the emerging
Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) with two specialized modules: Progressive
Attention-Guided Feature Fusion (PAGF) and the Multi-scale Adaptive KAN (MAN).
Our PAGF module replaces the simple skip connection, using attention to fuse
features from the encoder and decoder. The MAN module enables the network to
adaptively process features at multiple scales, improving its ability to
segment objects of various sizes. Experiments on three public datasets (BUSI,
GLAS, and CVC) show that U-MAN outperforms state-of-the-art methods,
particularly in defining accurate boundaries and preserving fine details.

Motivation: 传统模式识别模型使用为人类感知设计的预处理数据，但在自动化分析场景中这种预处理可能不是最优的。特别是在低带宽和能量受限的传感器设备中，高比特ADC数据传输效率低下，严重影响电池寿命。

Method: 提出γ-Quant方法，即任务特定的非线性量化学习。该方法针对原始图像目标检测和可穿戴设备的人体活动识别任务，学习可训练的量化函数。

Result: 实验表明，使用仅4位可学习量化的原始数据，在性能上可以与使用12位原始数据相媲美。

Conclusion: 在低比特深度采集限制下，任务特定的非线性量化方法能够显著提高数据传输效率，同时保持模式识别性能，为能量受限设备提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Most pattern recognition models are developed on pre-proce\-ssed data. In
computer vision, for instance, RGB images processed through image signal
processing (ISP) pipelines designed to cater to human perception are the most
frequent input to image analysis networks. However, many modern vision tasks
operate without a human in the loop, raising the question of whether such
pre-processing is optimal for automated analysis. Similarly, human activity
recognition (HAR) on body-worn sensor data commonly takes normalized
floating-point data arising from a high-bit analog-to-digital converter (ADC)
as an input, despite such an approach being highly inefficient in terms of data
transmission, significantly affecting the battery life of wearable devices. In
this work, we target low-bandwidth and energy-constrained settings where
sensors are limited to low-bit-depth capture. We propose $\gamma$-Quant,
i.e.~the task-specific learning of a non-linear quantization for pattern
recognition. We exemplify our approach on raw-image object detection as well as
HAR of wearable data, and demonstrate that raw data with a learnable
quantization using as few as 4-bits can perform on par with the use of raw
12-bit data. All code to reproduce our experiments is publicly available via

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决应用导向的VIF方法需要下游任务标注数据的问题，传统方法只关注融合图像质量，而应用导向方法需要标注数据，数据获取成本高。

Method: 利用特征级融合分割和像素级融合分割的一致性，提出跨分割一致性自监督任务，设计两阶段训练策略和动态权重调整方法。

Result: 在公开数据集上的实验表明，SSVIF仅使用未标注的可见光-红外图像对训练，但性能优于传统VIF方法，并与有监督的分割导向方法相当。

Conclusion: 提出的自监督框架SSVIF能够有效解决应用导向VIF方法的数据标注问题，在无分割标签的情况下实现高质量融合。

Abstract: Visible and infrared image fusion (VIF) has gained significant attention in
recent years due to its wide application in tasks such as scene segmentation
and object detection. VIF methods can be broadly classified into traditional
VIF methods and application-oriented VIF methods. Traditional methods focus
solely on improving the quality of fused images, while application-oriented VIF
methods additionally consider the performance of downstream tasks on fused
images by introducing task-specific loss terms during training. However,
compared to traditional methods, application-oriented VIF methods require
datasets labeled for downstream tasks (e.g., semantic segmentation or object
detection), making data acquisition labor-intensive and time-consuming. To
address this issue, we propose a self-supervised training framework for
segmentation-oriented VIF methods (SSVIF). Leveraging the consistency between
feature-level fusion-based segmentation and pixel-level fusion-based
segmentation, we introduce a novel self-supervised task-cross-segmentation
consistency-that enables the fusion model to learn high-level semantic features
without the supervision of segmentation labels. Additionally, we design a
two-stage training strategy and a dynamic weight adjustment method for
effective joint learning within our self-supervised framework. Extensive
experiments on public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed
SSVIF. Remarkably, although trained only on unlabeled visible-infrared image
pairs, our SSVIF outperforms traditional VIF methods and rivals supervised
segmentation-oriented ones. Our code will be released upon acceptance.

Motivation: 解决医学影像跨模态训练中存在的领域差距问题，传统GAN方法在高度可变区域难以捕捉跨域映射

Result: 在公共数据集上生成逼真的带标签图像，显著增强目标域数据并改善分割性能

Conclusion: 该框架能有效生成高质量跨域医学图像，为跨模态医学影像分析提供有力支持

Abstract: Training robust learning algorithms across different medical imaging
modalities is challenging due to the large domain gap. Unsupervised domain
adaptation (UDA) mitigates this problem by using annotated images from the
source domain and unlabeled images from the target domain to train the deep
models. Existing approaches often rely on GAN-based style transfer, but these
methods struggle to capture cross-domain mappings in regions with high
variability. In this paper, we propose a unified framework, B\'ezier Meets
Diffusion, for cross-domain image generation. First, we introduce a
B\'ezier-curve-based style transfer strategy that effectively reduces the
domain gap between source and target domains. The transferred source images
enable the training of a more robust segmentation model across domains.
Thereafter, using pseudo-labels generated by this segmentation model on the
target domain, we train a conditional diffusion model (CDM) to synthesize
high-quality, labeled target-domain images. To mitigate the impact of noisy
pseudo-labels, we further develop an uncertainty-guided score matching method
that improves the robustness of CDM training. Extensive experiments on public
datasets demonstrate that our approach generates realistic labeled images,
significantly augmenting the target domain and improving segmentation
performance.

### [140] [PSTTS: A Plug-and-Play Token Selector for Efficient Event-based Spatio-temporal Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22481)
*Xiangmo Zhao,Nan Yang,Yang Wang,Zhanwen Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了PSTTS（渐进式时空令牌选择）模块，通过利用原始事件数据的时空分布特征来识别和丢弃冗余令牌，在保持精度的同时显著提升效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的事件处理方法将事件流转换为事件帧序列，但忽略了事件帧序列的高空间稀疏性和帧间运动冗余，导致计算开销大。现有的RGB视频令牌稀疏化方法依赖不可靠的中间令牌表示且忽视事件噪声影响，无法直接应用于事件数据。

Method: PSTTS包含两个阶段：空间令牌净化（通过评估每个事件帧内事件的时空一致性来丢弃噪声和非事件区域）和时间令牌选择（通过评估相邻事件帧间运动模式相似性来识别和移除冗余时间信息）。该模块无需额外参数，可即插即用。

Result: 在HARDVS、DailyDVS-200和SeACT数据集上测试了UniformerV2、VideoSwin、EVMamba和ExACT四个代表性骨干网络。在DailyDVS-200数据集上，PSTTS将FLOPs降低了29-43.6%，FPS提升了21.6-41.3%，同时保持了任务精度。

Conclusion: PSTTS通过利用事件数据的固有特性有效解决了事件帧序列中的时空冗余问题，实现了精度与效率的最佳平衡，为事件数据处理提供了高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Mainstream event-based spatio-temporal representation learning methods
typically process event streams by converting them into sequences of event
frames, achieving remarkable performance. However, they neglect the high
spatial sparsity and inter-frame motion redundancy inherent in event frame
sequences, leading to significant computational overhead. Existing token
sparsification methods for RGB videos rely on unreliable intermediate token
representations and neglect the influence of event noise, making them
ineffective for direct application to event data. In this paper, we propose
Progressive Spatio-Temporal Token Selection (PSTTS), a Plug-and-Play module for
event data without introducing any additional parameters. PSTTS exploits the
spatio-temporal distribution characteristics embedded in raw event data to
effectively identify and discard spatio-temporal redundant tokens, achieving an
optimal trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. Specifically, PSTTS consists
of two stages, Spatial Token Purification and Temporal Token Selection. Spatial
Token Purification discards noise and non-event regions by assessing the
spatio-temporal consistency of events within each event frame to prevent
interference with subsequent temporal redundancy evaluation. Temporal Token
Selection evaluates the motion pattern similarity between adjacent event
frames, precisely identifying and removing redundant temporal information. We
apply PSTTS to four representative backbones UniformerV2, VideoSwin, EVMamba,
and ExACT on the HARDVS, DailyDVS-200, and SeACT datasets. Experimental results
demonstrate that PSTTS achieves significant efficiency improvements.
Specifically, PSTTS reduces FLOPs by 29-43.6% and increases FPS by 21.6-41.3%
on the DailyDVS-200 dataset, while maintaining task accuracy. Our code will be
available.

TL;DR: 提出了GCPO方法，通过识别关键图像token并进行针对性的策略优化，在仅使用30% token的情况下超越了全token优化的GRPO方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法对所有图像token进行统一优化，但不同token对RLVR训练的贡献度不同，需要识别关键token并进行有效优化。

Method: 从三个角度识别关键token：因果依赖、熵诱导空间结构、RLVR聚焦的token多样性；引入动态token-wise优势权重来鼓励探索。

Result: 在多个文本到图像基准测试中，GCPO在AR模型和统一多模态模型上都表现出有效性。

Conclusion: GCPO通过聚焦关键token实现了更有效的策略优化，为AR视觉生成提供了新的优化思路。

Abstract: Recent studies have extended Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards
(RLVR) to autoregressive (AR) visual generation and achieved promising
progress. However, existing methods typically apply uniform optimization across
all image tokens, while the varying contributions of different image tokens for
RLVR's training remain unexplored. In fact, the key obstacle lies in how to
identify more critical image tokens during AR generation and implement
effective token-wise optimization for them. To tackle this challenge, we
propose $\textbf{G}$roup $\textbf{C}$ritical-token $\textbf{P}$olicy
$\textbf{O}$ptimization ($\textbf{GCPO}$), which facilitates effective policy
optimization on critical tokens. We identify the critical tokens in RLVR-based
AR generation from three perspectives, specifically: $\textbf{(1)}$ Causal
dependency: early tokens fundamentally determine the later tokens and final
image effect due to unidirectional dependency; $\textbf{(2)}$ Entropy-induced
spatial structure: tokens with high entropy gradients correspond to image
structure and bridges distinct visual regions; $\textbf{(3)}$ RLVR-focused
token diversity: tokens with low visual similarity across a group of sampled
images contribute to richer token-level diversity. For these identified
critical tokens, we further introduce a dynamic token-wise advantage weight to
encourage exploration, based on confidence divergence between the policy model
and reference model. By leveraging 30\% of the image tokens, GCPO achieves
better performance than GRPO with full tokens. Extensive experiments on
multiple text-to-image benchmarks for both AR models and unified multimodal
models demonstrate the effectiveness of GCPO for AR visual generation.

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在视觉输入与自然语言输出对齐方面表现出色，但生成的token对视觉模态的依赖程度尚不清楚，这限制了模型的可解释性和可靠性。

Conclusion: EAGLE在提升多模态大语言模型可解释性方面具有有效性和实用性。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in aligning visual inputs with natural language outputs. Yet, the
extent to which generated tokens depend on visual modalities remains poorly
understood, limiting interpretability and reliability. In this work, we present
EAGLE, a lightweight black-box framework for explaining autoregressive token
generation in MLLMs. EAGLE attributes any selected tokens to compact perceptual
regions while quantifying the relative influence of language priors and
perceptual evidence. The framework introduces an objective function that
unifies sufficiency (insight score) and indispensability (necessity score),
optimized via greedy search over sparsified image regions for faithful and
efficient attribution. Beyond spatial attribution, EAGLE performs
modality-aware analysis that disentangles what tokens rely on, providing
fine-grained interpretability of model decisions. Extensive experiments across
open-source MLLMs show that EAGLE consistently outperforms existing methods in
faithfulness, localization, and hallucination diagnosis, while requiring
substantially less GPU memory. These results highlight its effectiveness and
practicality for advancing the interpretability of MLLMs. The code is available

Result: 模型在典型颜色上准确率高，但在扩展的非典型颜色集上表现显著下降；识别出21个在所有模型中一致出现的颜色术语；发现语言模型架构独立于视觉处理能力显著影响颜色命名。

Conclusion: 视觉语言模型在颜色命名方面存在局限性，特别是在非典型颜色和跨语言场景中，需要改进以更好地模拟人类颜色认知。

Abstract: Color serves as a fundamental dimension of human visual perception and a
primary means of communicating about objects and scenes. As vision-language
models (VLMs) become increasingly prevalent, understanding whether they name
colors like humans is crucial for effective human-AI interaction. We present
the first systematic evaluation of color naming capabilities across VLMs,
replicating classic color naming methodologies using 957 color samples across
five representative models. Our results show that while VLMs achieve high
accuracy on prototypical colors from classical studies, performance drops
significantly on expanded, non-prototypical color sets. We identify 21 common
color terms that consistently emerge across all models, revealing two distinct
approaches: constrained models using predominantly basic terms versus expansive
models employing systematic lightness modifiers. Cross-linguistic analysis
across nine languages demonstrates severe training imbalances favoring English
and Chinese, with hue serving as the primary driver of color naming decisions.
Finally, ablation studies reveal that language model architecture significantly
influences color naming independent of visual processing capabilities.

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation (MDE) plays a pivotal role in various computer
vision applications, such as robotics, augmented reality, and autonomous
driving. Despite recent advancements, existing methods often fail to meet key
requirements for 3D reconstruction and view synthesis, including geometric
consistency, fine details, robustness to real-world challenges like reflective
surfaces, and efficiency for edge devices. To address these challenges, we
introduce a novel MDE system, called EfficientDepth, which combines a
transformer architecture with a lightweight convolutional decoder, as well as a
bimodal density head that allows the network to estimate detailed depth maps.
We train our model on a combination of labeled synthetic and real images, as
well as pseudo-labeled real images, generated using a high-performing MDE
method. Furthermore, we employ a multi-stage optimization strategy to improve
training efficiency and produce models that emphasize geometric consistency and
fine detail. Finally, in addition to commonly used objectives, we introduce a
loss function based on LPIPS to encourage the network to produce detailed depth
maps. Experimental results demonstrate that EfficientDepth achieves performance
comparable to or better than existing state-of-the-art models, with
significantly reduced computational resources.

Abstract: Category discovery (CD) is an emerging open-world learning task, which aims
at automatically categorizing unlabelled data containing instances from unseen
classes, given some labelled data from seen classes. This task has attracted
significant attention over the years and leads to a rich body of literature
trying to address the problem from different perspectives. In this survey, we
provide a comprehensive review of the literature, and offer detailed analysis
and in-depth discussion on different methods. Firstly, we introduce a taxonomy
for the literature by considering two base settings, namely novel category
discovery (NCD) and generalized category discovery (GCD), and several derived
settings that are designed to address the extra challenges in different
real-world application scenarios, including continual category discovery,
skewed data distribution, federated category discovery, etc. Secondly, for each
setting, we offer a detailed analysis of the methods encompassing three
fundamental components, representation learning, label assignment, and
estimation of class number. Thirdly, we benchmark all the methods and distill
key insights showing that large-scale pretrained backbones, hierarchical and
auxiliary cues, and curriculum-style training are all beneficial for category
discovery, while challenges remain in the design of label assignment, the
estimation of class numbers, and scaling to complex multi-object
scenarios.Finally, we discuss the key insights from the literature so far and

TL;DR: HyCoVAD是一个混合SSL-LLM模型，结合自监督学习和大型语言模型来检测复杂视频异常，在ComplexVAD数据集上达到72.5%的帧级AUC，比现有基线提升12.5%，同时减少LLM计算量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在检测复杂异常时存在局限：自监督学习难以理解语义交互，而大型语言模型计算成本高且缺乏细粒度空间定位。

Method: 使用nnFormer作为SSL时序分析器进行多任务训练识别可疑帧，然后通过LLM进行基于规则的结构化推理来验证异常。

Result: 在ComplexVAD数据集上实现72.5%的帧级AUC，比基线方法提升12.5%，同时显著减少LLM计算量。

Conclusion: HyCoVAD通过SSL-LLM混合方法有效解决了复杂视频异常检测问题，在性能和效率上均优于现有方法。

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) is crucial for intelligent surveillance, but a
significant challenge lies in identifying complex anomalies, which are events
defined by intricate relationships and temporal dependencies among multiple
entities rather than by isolated actions. While self-supervised learning (SSL)
methods effectively model low-level spatiotemporal patterns, they often
struggle to grasp the semantic meaning of these interactions. Conversely, large
language models (LLMs) offer powerful contextual reasoning but are
computationally expensive for frame-by-frame analysis and lack fine-grained
spatial localization. We introduce HyCoVAD, Hybrid Complex Video Anomaly
Detection, a hybrid SSL-LLM model that combines a multi-task SSL temporal
analyzer with LLM validator. The SSL module is built upon an nnFormer backbone
which is a transformer-based model for image segmentation. It is trained with
multiple proxy tasks, learns from video frames to identify those suspected of
anomaly. The selected frames are then forwarded to the LLM, which enriches the

*Jini Yang,Beomseok Oh,Seungryong Kim,Sunok Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpikeMatch是首个针对脉冲神经网络的半监督学习框架，利用SNN的时间动态特性生成多样化伪标签，在有限标签下实现高效学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脉冲神经网络具有生物合理性和高能效，但其半监督学习方法相比人工神经网络仍未被充分探索。

Method: 利用SNN的泄漏因子时间动态，在协同训练框架中生成多样化伪标签，通过弱增强未标记样本生成可靠伪标签来训练强增强样本。

Result: 实验表明SpikeMatch在各种标准基准测试中优于现有适配到SNN骨干网络的SSL方法。

Conclusion: SpikeMatch成功证明了利用SNN时间动态进行半监督学习的有效性，为SNN的SSL研究开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have recently been attracting significant
attention for their biological plausibility and energy efficiency, but
semi-supervised learning (SSL) methods for SNN-based models remain
underexplored compared to those for artificial neural networks (ANNs). In this
paper, we introduce SpikeMatch, the first SSL framework for SNNs that leverages
the temporal dynamics through the leakage factor of SNNs for diverse
pseudo-labeling within a co-training framework. By utilizing agreement among
multiple predictions from a single SNN, SpikeMatch generates reliable
pseudo-labels from weakly-augmented unlabeled samples to train on
strongly-augmented ones, effectively mitigating confirmation bias by capturing
discriminative features with limited labels. Experiments show that SpikeMatch
outperforms existing SSL methods adapted to SNN backbones across various
standard benchmarks.

*Yasmine Omri,Connor Ding,Tsachy Weissman,Thierry Tambe*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文探索使用2D高斯泼溅(2DGS)作为视觉语言模型的替代视觉表示，以解决RGB图像传输成本高和注意力序列长度爆炸的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统RGB视觉编码器在边缘计算中的两个结构性问题：密集RGB图像传输能耗高成本大，以及基于补丁的标记化导致序列长度爆炸，增加注意力计算负担。

Method: 开发可扩展的2DGS流水线，包括结构化初始化、亮度感知剪枝和批量CUDA内核；通过轻量级泼溅感知输入主干和感知器重采样器，将对比语言图像预训练(CLIP)适配到2DGS表示，仅训练约7%的总参数。

Result: 2DGS编码器在大型DataComp子集上实现了有意义的零样本ImageNet-1K性能，同时将输入压缩3到20倍；虽然准确率目前落后于RGB编码器，但实现了超过90倍的拟合加速和约97%的GPU利用率。

Conclusion: 2DGS被确立为可行的多模态基板，识别了架构瓶颈，并为开发既具有语义能力又传输高效的边缘云学习表示开辟了道路。

Abstract: Modern vision language pipelines are driven by RGB vision encoders trained on
massive image text corpora. While these pipelines have enabled impressive zero
shot capabilities and strong transfer across tasks, they still inherit two
structural inefficiencies from the pixel domain: (i) transmitting dense RGB
images from edge devices to the cloud is energy intensive and costly, and (ii)
patch based tokenization explodes sequence length, stressing attention budgets
and context limits. We explore 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) as an alternative
visual substrate for alignment: a compact, spatially adaptive representation
that parameterizes images by a set of colored anisotropic Gaussians. We develop
a scalable 2DGS pipeline with structured initialization, luminance aware
pruning, and batched CUDA kernels, achieving over 90x faster fitting and about
97% GPU utilization compared to prior implementations. We further adapt
contrastive language image pretraining (CLIP) to 2DGS by reusing a frozen
RGB-based transformer backbone with a lightweight splat aware input stem and a
perceiver resampler, training only about 7% of the total parameters. On large
DataComp subsets, GS encoders yield meaningful zero shot ImageNet-1K
performance while compressing inputs 3 to 20x relative to pixels. While
accuracy currently trails RGB encoders, our results establish 2DGS as a viable
multimodal substrate, pinpoint architectural bottlenecks, and open a path
toward representations that are both semantically powerful and transmission
efficient for edge cloud learning.

TL;DR: LongLive是一个用于实时交互式长视频生成的帧级自回归框架，通过KV重缓存机制、流式长调优和帧级注意力汇等关键技术，在保持高质量的同时实现了高效的长视频生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决长视频生成在效率和交互性方面的挑战：扩散模型效率低，因果注意力模型在长视频上质量下降，以及交互式生成中视觉一致性和语义连贯性的需求。

Method: 采用因果帧级自回归设计，集成KV重缓存机制用于流畅提示切换，流式长调优实现长视频训练，短窗口注意力配合帧级注意力汇保持长程一致性。

Result: 仅用32 GPU天将1.3B参数的短片段模型微调到分钟级生成，在H100上达到20.7 FPS，支持240秒视频生成，INT8量化推理质量损失极小。

Conclusion: LongLive框架成功解决了长视频生成在效率、质量和交互性方面的核心挑战，为实时动态内容创作提供了可行方案。

Abstract: We present LongLive, a frame-level autoregressive (AR) framework for
real-time and interactive long video generation. Long video generation presents
challenges in both efficiency and quality. Diffusion and Diffusion-Forcing
models can produce high-quality videos but suffer from low efficiency due to
bidirectional attention. Causal attention AR models support KV caching for
faster inference, but often degrade in quality on long videos due to memory
challenges during long-video training. In addition, beyond static prompt-based
generation, interactive capabilities, such as streaming prompt inputs, are
critical for dynamic content creation, enabling users to guide narratives in
real time. This interactive requirement significantly increases complexity,
especially in ensuring visual consistency and semantic coherence during prompt
transitions. To address these challenges, LongLive adopts a causal, frame-level
AR design that integrates a KV-recache mechanism that refreshes cached states
with new prompts for smooth, adherent switches; streaming long tuning to enable
long video training and to align training and inference (train-long-test-long);
and short window attention paired with a frame-level attention sink, shorten as
frame sink, preserving long-range consistency while enabling faster generation.
With these key designs, LongLive fine-tunes a 1.3B-parameter short-clip model
to minute-long generation in just 32 GPU-days. At inference, LongLive sustains
20.7 FPS on a single NVIDIA H100, achieves strong performance on VBench in both
short and long videos. LongLive supports up to 240-second videos on a single
H100 GPU. LongLive further supports INT8-quantized inference with only marginal
quality loss.

*Ziyu Liu,Yuhang Zang,Shengyuan Ding,Yuhang Cao,Xiaoyi Dong,Haodong Duan,Dahua Lin,Jiaqi Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPARK框架通过协同策略和奖励模型共同进化，解决了RLHF成本高和RLVR监督浪费的问题，实现了无需外部奖励模型的高效强化学习训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RLHF依赖人类偏好数据成本高昂且存在奖励-策略不匹配问题，而RLVR在每次更新后丢弃滚动数据和正确性信号造成监督浪费。

Method: SPARK框架在RLVR基础上回收利用滚动数据和正确性信息，同时训练模型作为生成式奖励模型，使用点式奖励评分、成对比较和反思条件评估等混合目标。

Result: SPARK在多个LLM和LVLM模型上取得显著性能提升，SPARK-VL-7B在7个推理基准上平均提升9.7%，2个奖励基准上提升12.1%，8个通用基准上提升1.5%。

Conclusion: SPARK创建了正反馈循环，消除了对单独奖励模型和人类偏好数据的需求，支持通过自我反思进行测试时扩展，展现了鲁棒性和广泛泛化能力。

Abstract: Recent Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs)
increasingly use Reinforcement Learning (RL) for post-pretraining, such as RL
with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) for objective tasks and RL from Human Feedback
(RLHF) for subjective tasks. However, RLHF incurs high costs and potential
reward-policy mismatch due to reliance on human preferences, while RLVR still
wastes supervision by discarding rollouts and correctness signals after each
update. To address these challenges, we introduce the Synergistic Policy And
Reward Co-Evolving Framework (SPARK), an efficient, on-policy, and stable
method that builds on RLVR. Instead of discarding rollouts and correctness
data, SPARK recycles this valuable information to simultaneously train the
model itself as a generative reward model. This auxiliary training uses a mix
of objectives, such as pointwise reward score, pairwise comparison, and
evaluation conditioned on further-reflection responses, to teach the model to
evaluate and improve its own responses. Our process eliminates the need for a
separate reward model and costly human preference data. SPARK creates a
positive co-evolving feedback loop: improved reward accuracy yields better
policy gradients, which in turn produce higher-quality rollouts that further
refine the reward model. Our unified framework supports test-time scaling via
self-reflection without external reward models and their associated costs. We
show that SPARK achieves significant performance gains on multiple LLM and LVLM
models and multiple reasoning, reward models, and general benchmarks. For
example, SPARK-VL-7B achieves an average 9.7% gain on 7 reasoning benchmarks,
12.1% on 2 reward benchmarks, and 1.5% on 8 general benchmarks over the
baselines, demonstrating robustness and broad generalization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出CCNeXt架构，一种新型自监督深度估计方法，在保持计算效率的同时超越现有CNN和ViT模型性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度估计在机器人、自动驾驶和AR中至关重要，但这些场景通常受计算能力限制。由于难以获取多样化场景的可靠深度真值数据，自监督技术成为解决方案

Method: CCNeXt架构采用现代CNN特征提取器，结合新颖的窗口化极线交叉注意力模块，并全面重新设计了深度估计解码器

Result: 在KITTI Eigen Split测试数据上达到竞争性指标，比当前最佳模型快10.18倍，在KITTI Eigen Split改进真值和Driving Stereo数据集的所有指标上均达到最先进水平

Conclusion: CCNeXt在深度估计任务中实现了性能与计算效率的良好平衡，为实际应用提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: Depth Estimation plays a crucial role in recent applications in robotics,
autonomous vehicles, and augmented reality. These scenarios commonly operate
under constraints imposed by computational power. Stereo image pairs offer an
effective solution for depth estimation since it only needs to estimate the
disparity of pixels in image pairs to determine the depth in a known rectified
system. Due to the difficulty in acquiring reliable ground-truth depth data
across diverse scenarios, self-supervised techniques emerge as a solution,
particularly when large unlabeled datasets are available. We propose a novel
self-supervised convolutional approach that outperforms existing
state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers
(ViTs) while balancing computational cost. The proposed CCNeXt architecture
employs a modern CNN feature extractor with a novel windowed epipolar
cross-attention module in the encoder, complemented by a comprehensive redesign
of the depth estimation decoder. Our experiments demonstrate that CCNeXt
achieves competitive metrics on the KITTI Eigen Split test data while being
10.18$\times$ faster than the current best model and achieves state-of-the-art
results in all metrics in the KITTI Eigen Split Improved Ground Truth and
Driving Stereo datasets when compared to recently proposed techniques. To

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UML-CoT是一个利用统一建模语言(UML)的结构化推理和规划框架，通过类图和活动图生成符号思维链和可执行动作计划，在杂乱房间清洁场景中优于非结构化CoT。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的思维链提示依赖非结构化文本，在具身任务中可解释性和可执行性有限。现有的结构化CoT方法只能建模低阶关系，缺乏继承、行为抽象等构造，也没有顺序或条件规划的标准语义。

Method: 提出UML-CoT框架，使用UML类图捕捉组合对象语义，活动图建模过程控制流。采用三阶段训练流程，结合监督微调和GRPO策略优化，包括从仅答案数据中学习奖励。

Result: 在MRoom-30k新基准测试中，UML-CoT在可解释性、规划连贯性和执行成功率方面优于非结构化CoT方法。

Conclusion: UML作为一种更具表达力和可操作性的结构化推理形式化方法，在具身推理任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting improves reasoning in large language models
(LLMs), but its reliance on unstructured text limits interpretability and
executability in embodied tasks. Prior work has explored structured CoTs using
scene or logic graphs, yet these remain fundamentally limited: they model only
low-order relations, lack constructs like inheritance or behavioral
abstraction, and provide no standardized semantics for sequential or
conditional planning. We propose UML-CoT, a structured reasoning and planning
framework that leverages Unified Modeling Language (UML) to generate symbolic
CoTs and executable action plans. UML class diagrams capture compositional
object semantics, while activity diagrams model procedural control flow. Our
three-stage training pipeline combines supervised fine-tuning with Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), including reward learning from answer-only
data. We evaluate UML-CoT on MRoom-30k, a new benchmark of cluttered
room-cleaning scenarios. UML-CoT outperforms unstructured CoTs in
interpretability, planning coherence, and execution success, highlighting UML
as a more expressive and actionable structured reasoning formalism.

TL;DR: Labeling Copilot是首个用于计算机视觉的数据策展深度研究代理，通过多模态语言模型驱动的中央编排器，结合校准发现、可控合成和共识标注三大核心能力，实现高效、高质量的领域特定数据集构建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 构建高质量领域特定数据集是部署稳健视觉系统的主要瓶颈，需要在数据质量、多样性和成本之间进行复杂权衡。现有方法难以有效处理大规模未标注数据湖。

Method: 使用多模态语言模型驱动的中央编排器进行多步推理，执行三大核心工具：校准发现从大型存储库中获取相关数据；可控合成生成稀有场景的新数据；共识标注通过新颖的共识机制协调多个基础模型进行准确标注。

Result: 在COCO数据集上，共识标注模块平均每图像生成14.2个候选提案（接近真实对象7.4的两倍），最终标注mAP达到37.1%。在Open Images数据集上发现903个新的边界框类别，总能力扩展至1500+类别。校准发现在1000万样本规模测试中，计算效率比替代方案高40倍。

Conclusion: 具有优化、可扩展工具的代理工作流程为构建工业规模数据集提供了稳健基础，证明Labeling Copilot在数据策展方面的有效性。

Abstract: Curating high-quality, domain-specific datasets is a major bottleneck for
deploying robust vision systems, requiring complex trade-offs between data
quality, diversity, and cost when researching vast, unlabeled data lakes. We
introduce Labeling Copilot, the first data curation deep research agent for
computer vision. A central orchestrator agent, powered by a large multimodal
language model, uses multi-step reasoning to execute specialized tools across
three core capabilities: (1) Calibrated Discovery sources relevant,
in-distribution data from large repositories; (2) Controllable Synthesis
generates novel data for rare scenarios with robust filtering; and (3)
Consensus Annotation produces accurate labels by orchestrating multiple
foundation models via a novel consensus mechanism incorporating non-maximum
suppression and voting. Our large-scale validation proves the effectiveness of
Labeling Copilot's components. The Consensus Annotation module excels at object
discovery: on the dense COCO dataset, it averages 14.2 candidate proposals per
image-nearly double the 7.4 ground-truth objects-achieving a final annotation
mAP of 37.1%. On the web-scale Open Images dataset, it navigated extreme class
imbalance to discover 903 new bounding box categories, expanding its capability
to over 1500 total. Concurrently, our Calibrated Discovery tool, tested at a
10-million sample scale, features an active learning strategy that is up to 40x
more computationally efficient than alternatives with equivalent sample
efficiency. These experiments validate that an agentic workflow with optimized,
scalable tools provides a robust foundation for curating industrial-scale
datasets.

Motivation: 解决小样本图像分类中标记数据有限的问题，避免现有方法需要模型微调或外部信息源的依赖。

Method: 使用IP-Adapter进行图像到图像转换，引入扩展的无分类器引导方案、基于类相似性的采样策略，无需模型微调或外部工具。

Result: 在十个基准数据集上达到最先进或可比较的性能，特别是在细粒度分类任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: 通过正负图像引导的双重图像提示方法能有效生成类判别特征，为小样本分类提供高效解决方案。

Abstract: Few-shot image classification remains challenging due to the limited
availability of labeled examples. Recent approaches have explored generating
synthetic training data using text-to-image diffusion models, but often require
extensive model fine-tuning or external information sources. We present a novel
training-free approach, called DIPSY, that leverages IP-Adapter for
image-to-image translation to generate highly discriminative synthetic images
using only the available few-shot examples. DIPSY introduces three key
innovations: (1) an extended classifier-free guidance scheme that enables
independent control over positive and negative image conditioning; (2) a class
similarity-based sampling strategy that identifies effective contrastive
examples; and (3) a simple yet effective pipeline that requires no model
fine-tuning or external captioning and filtering. Experiments across ten
benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art or
comparable performance, while eliminating the need for generative model
adaptation or reliance on external tools for caption generation and image
filtering. Our results highlight the effectiveness of leveraging dual image
prompting with positive-negative guidance for generating class-discriminative
features, particularly for fine-grained classification tasks.

Result: 在多个数据集上，基于扩散视角的VAR在效率和生成质量方面均获得一致提升，收敛更快、推理成本更低。

Conclusion: AR变换器与扩散模型之间存在理论等价性，这种新视角能有效提升视觉生成模型的性能和效率。

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) transformers have emerged as a powerful paradigm for
visual generation, largely due to their scalability, computational efficiency
and unified architecture with language and vision. Among them, next scale
prediction Visual Autoregressive Generation (VAR) has recently demonstrated
remarkable performance, even surpassing diffusion-based models. In this work,
we revisit VAR and uncover a theoretical insight: when equipped with a
Markovian attention mask, VAR is mathematically equivalent to a discrete
diffusion. We term this reinterpretation as Scalable Visual Refinement with
Discrete Diffusion (SRDD), establishing a principled bridge between AR
transformers and diffusion models. Leveraging this new perspective, we show how
one can directly import the advantages of diffusion such as iterative
refinement and reduce architectural inefficiencies into VAR, yielding faster
convergence, lower inference cost, and improved zero-shot reconstruction.
Across multiple datasets, we show that the diffusion based perspective of VAR
leads to consistent gains in efficiency and generation.

TL;DR: HERMAN方法通过利用LLM生成分层文本描述符，增强CLIP在类增量学习中的语义空间，实现精确分类并缓解灾难性遗忘。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CLIP方法使用简单模板（如"a photo of a [CLASS]"）忽略了视觉概念的层次性，且仅使用最后一层特征，忽视了早期层的分层信息。

Method: 利用LLM递归生成区分性文本描述符，将这些描述符匹配到语义层次的不同级别，并根据任务需求自适应路由。

Result: 在多个基准测试上的广泛实验表明，该方法持续达到最先进的性能。

Conclusion: HERMAN方法通过分层表示匹配有效提升了CLIP在类增量学习中的性能，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) aims to endow models with the ability to
continuously adapt to evolving data streams. Recent advances in pre-trained
vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) provide a powerful foundation for this
task. However, existing approaches often rely on simplistic templates, such as
"a photo of a [CLASS]", which overlook the hierarchical nature of visual
concepts. For example, recognizing "cat" versus "car" depends on coarse-grained
cues, while distinguishing "cat" from "lion" requires fine-grained details.
Similarly, the current feature mapping in CLIP relies solely on the
representation from the last layer, neglecting the hierarchical information
contained in earlier layers. In this work, we introduce HiErarchical
Representation MAtchiNg (HERMAN) for CLIP-based CIL. Our approach leverages
LLMs to recursively generate discriminative textual descriptors, thereby
augmenting the semantic space with explicit hierarchical cues. These
descriptors are matched to different levels of the semantic hierarchy and
adaptively routed based on task-specific requirements, enabling precise
discrimination while alleviating catastrophic forgetting in incremental tasks.
Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method
consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: DeeptraceReward是首个细粒度、时空感知的基准数据集，用于标注人类感知的AI生成视频伪影痕迹，包含4.3K详细标注，训练的多模态奖励模型在伪影识别、定位和解释方面优于GPT-5 34.7%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然视频生成模型快速发展，但人类能否检测深度伪造痕迹这一关键维度被忽视，需要建立细粒度的基准来评估人类感知的AI生成视频伪影。

Method: 构建包含4.3K详细标注的数据集，每个标注包含自然语言解释、边界框区域定位和精确时间戳，将这些标注整合为9大类深度伪造痕迹，并训练多模态语言模型作为奖励模型来模拟人类判断和定位。

Result: 7B奖励模型在伪影识别、定位和解释方面平均优于GPT-5 34.7%，观察到一致的难度梯度：二元真假分类比细粒度伪影检测更容易，在后者中从自然语言解释（最容易）到空间定位再到时间标注（最难）性能逐渐下降。

Conclusion: 通过突出人类感知的深度伪造痕迹，DeeptraceReward为社会意识和可信赖的视频生成提供了严格的测试平台和训练信号。

Abstract: Can humans identify AI-generated (fake) videos and provide grounded reasons?
While video generation models have advanced rapidly, a critical dimension --
whether humans can detect deepfake traces within a generated video, i.e.,
spatiotemporal grounded visual artifacts that reveal a video as machine
generated -- has been largely overlooked. We introduce DeeptraceReward, the
first fine-grained, spatially- and temporally- aware benchmark that annotates
human-perceived fake traces for video generation reward. The dataset comprises
4.3K detailed annotations across 3.3K high-quality generated videos. Each
annotation provides a natural-language explanation, pinpoints a bounding-box
region containing the perceived trace, and marks precise onset and offset
timestamps. We consolidate these annotations into 9 major categories of
deepfake traces that lead humans to identify a video as AI-generated, and train
multimodal language models (LMs) as reward models to mimic human judgments and
localizations. On DeeptraceReward, our 7B reward model outperforms GPT-5 by
34.7% on average across fake clue identification, grounding, and explanation.
Interestingly, we observe a consistent difficulty gradient: binary fake v.s.
real classification is substantially easier than fine-grained deepfake trace
detection; within the latter, performance degrades from natural language
explanations (easiest), to spatial grounding, to temporal labeling (hardest).
By foregrounding human-perceived deepfake traces, DeeptraceReward provides a
rigorous testbed and training signal for socially aware and trustworthy video
generation.

TL;DR: 提出CapRL框架，使用强化学习替代监督微调进行图像描述生成，通过非视觉语言模型基于描述回答问题的准确性作为奖励信号，提升描述的多样性和质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前图像描述模型依赖昂贵人工标注数据、容易过拟合特定答案、缺乏多样性和泛化能力的问题。

Method: 采用两阶段解耦管道：LVLM生成描述，然后用独立的无视觉LLM基于描述回答选择题，根据回答准确率计算奖励。

Result: 在CapRL-5M数据集上预训练后，在12个基准测试中取得显著提升；在Prism评估框架中性能接近Qwen2.5-VL-72B，平均超过基线8.4%。

Conclusion: CapRL成功将RLVR范式应用于主观性图像描述任务，通过基于效用的奖励设计显著提升了描述质量和多样性。

Abstract: Image captioning is a fundamental task that bridges the visual and linguistic
domains, playing a critical role in pre-training Large Vision-Language Models
(LVLMs). Current state-of-the-art captioning models are typically trained with
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), a paradigm that relies on expensive, non-scalable
data annotated by humans or proprietary models. This approach often leads to
models that memorize specific ground-truth answers, limiting their generality
and ability to generate diverse, creative descriptions. To overcome the
limitation of SFT, we propose applying the Reinforcement Learning with
Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) paradigm to the open-ended task of image captioning.
A primary challenge, however, is designing an objective reward function for the
inherently subjective nature of what constitutes a "good" caption. We introduce
Captioning Reinforcement Learning (CapRL), a novel training framework that
redefines caption quality through its utility: a high-quality caption should
enable a non-visual language model to accurately answer questions about the
corresponding image. CapRL employs a decoupled two-stage pipeline where an LVLM
generates a caption, and the objective reward is derived from the accuracy of a
separate, vision-free LLM answering Multiple-Choice Questions based solely on
that caption. As the first study to apply RLVR to the subjective image
captioning task, we demonstrate that CapRL significantly enhances multiple
settings. Pretraining on the CapRL-5M caption dataset annotated by CapRL-3B
results in substantial gains across 12 benchmarks. Moreover, within the Prism
Framework for caption quality evaluation, CapRL achieves performance comparable
to Qwen2.5-VL-72B, while exceeding the baseline by an average margin of 8.4%.

Conclusion: 扩散变换器的注意力机制可直接用于视觉语言定位任务，通过适当的注意力处理策略可获得优异的性能，为训练无关的引用分割提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Most existing approaches to referring segmentation achieve strong performance
only through fine-tuning or by composing multiple pre-trained models, often at
the cost of additional training and architectural modifications. Meanwhile,
large-scale generative diffusion models encode rich semantic information,
making them attractive as general-purpose feature extractors. In this work, we
introduce a new method that directly exploits features, attention scores, from
diffusion transformers for downstream tasks, requiring neither architectural
modifications nor additional training. To systematically evaluate these
features, we extend benchmarks with vision-language grounding tasks spanning
both images and videos. Our key insight is that stop words act as attention
magnets: they accumulate surplus attention and can be filtered to reduce noise.
Moreover, we identify global attention sinks (GAS) emerging in deeper layers
and show that they can be safely suppressed or redirected onto auxiliary
tokens, leading to sharper and more accurate grounding maps. We further propose
an attention redistribution strategy, where appended stop words partition
background activations into smaller clusters, yielding sharper and more
localized heatmaps. Building on these findings, we develop RefAM, a simple
training-free grounding framework that combines cross-attention maps, GAS
handling, and redistribution. Across zero-shot referring image and video
segmentation benchmarks, our approach consistently outperforms prior methods,
establishing a new state of the art without fine-tuning or additional
components.

### [160] [Language-in-the-Loop Culvert Inspection on the Erie Canal](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21370)
*Yashom Dighe,Yash Turkar,Karthik Dantu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: VISION是一个端到端的自主检查系统，结合视觉语言模型和约束视角规划，用于自主检查运河涵洞，无需领域特定微调即可生成专家对齐的详细报告。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统人工检查运河涵洞存在年龄、几何形状、照明差、天气和难以接近等挑战，需要开发自主检查系统来提高效率和安全性。

Method: 使用网络级视觉语言模型生成开放词汇的感兴趣区域建议，融合立体深度恢复尺度，结合涵洞约束的规划器进行重新定位拍摄目标特写。

Result: 在伊利运河涵洞的四足机器人部署中，初始感兴趣区域建议与专家达成61.4%一致，重新成像后评估达到80%一致。

Conclusion: VISION系统能够将初步假设转化为基于事实的、与专家对齐的发现，证明了语言在环自主系统在基础设施检查中的有效性。

Abstract: Culverts on canals such as the Erie Canal, built originally in 1825, require
frequent inspections to ensure safe operation. Human inspection of culverts is
challenging due to age, geometry, poor illumination, weather, and lack of easy
access. We introduce VISION, an end-to-end, language-in-the-loop autonomy
system that couples a web-scale vision-language model (VLM) with constrained
viewpoint planning for autonomous inspection of culverts. Brief prompts to the
VLM solicit open-vocabulary ROI proposals with rationales and confidences,
stereo depth is fused to recover scale, and a planner -- aware of culvert
constraints -- commands repositioning moves to capture targeted close-ups.
Deployed on a quadruped in a culvert under the Erie Canal, VISION closes the
see, decide, move, re-image loop on-board and produces high-resolution images
for detailed reporting without domain-specific fine-tuning. In an external
evaluation by New York Canal Corporation personnel, initial ROI proposals
achieved 61.4\% agreement with subject-matter experts, and final
post-re-imaging assessments reached 80\%, indicating that VISION converts
tentative hypotheses into grounded, expert-aligned findings.

Abstract: This paper presents the design of a new soft-rigid robotic platform,
"GeoGami". We leverage origami surface capabilities to achieve shape
contraction and to support locomotion with underactuated forms. A key challenge
is that origami surfaces have high degrees of freedom and typically require
many actuators; we address repeatability by integrating surface compliance. We
propose a mono-actuated GeoGami mobile platform that combines origami surface
compliance with a geometric compliant skeleton, enabling the robot to transform
and locomote using a single actuator. We demonstrate the robot, develop a
stiffness model, and describe the central gearbox mechanism. We also analyze
alternative cable-driven actuation methods for the skeleton to enable surface
transformation. Finally, we evaluate the GeoGami platform for capabilities,
including shape transformation and rolling. This platform opens new
capabilities for robots that change shape to access different environments and
that use shape transformation for locomotion.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种针对四旋翼无人机在近壁环境中安全运行的解决方案，包括基于物理的吸力模型和吸力补偿模型预测控制框架，显著提升了轨迹跟踪精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决四旋翼在近壁城市或室内环境中因壁面接近产生的未建模空气动力学效应，这些效应会产生复杂涡流和失稳吸力，导致危险振动或碰撞。

Abstract: The safe operation of quadrotors in near-wall urban or indoor environments
(e.g., inspection and search-and-rescue missions) is challenged by unmodeled
aerodynamic effects arising from wall-proximity. It generates complex vortices
that induce destabilizing suction forces, potentially leading to hazardous
vibrations or collisions. This paper presents a comprehensive solution
featuring (1) a physics-based suction force model that explicitly characterizes
the dependency on both rotor speed and wall distance, and (2) a
suction-compensated model predictive control (SC-MPC) framework designed to
ensure accurate and stable trajectory tracking during wall-proximity
operations. The proposed SC-MPC framework incorporates an enhanced dynamics
model that accounts for suction force effects, formulated as a factor graph
optimization problem integrating system dynamics constraints, trajectory
tracking objectives, control input smoothness requirements, and actuator
physical limitations. The suction force model parameters are systematically
identified through extensive experimental measurements across varying
operational conditions. Experimental validation demonstrates SC-MPC's superior
performance, achieving 2.1 cm root mean squared error (RMSE) in X-axis and 2.0
cm RMSE in Y-axis position control - representing 74% and 79% improvements over
cascaded proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control, and 60% and 53%
improvements over standard MPC respectively. The corresponding mean absolute
error (MAE) metrics (1.2 cm X-axis, 1.4 cm Y-axis) similarly outperform both
baselines. The evaluation platform employs a ducted quadrotor design that
provides collision protection while maintaining aerodynamic efficiency. To
facilitate reproducibility and community adoption, we have open-sourced our
complete implementation, available at
https://anonymous.4open.science/r/SC-MPC-6A61.

Conclusion: DroneFL成功解决了多无人机目标跟踪中的联邦学习挑战，在保持高效性的同时显著提升了跟踪性能，为实际部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Multi-robot target tracking is a fundamental problem that requires
coordinated monitoring of dynamic entities in applications such as precision
agriculture, environmental monitoring, disaster response, and security
surveillance. While Federated Learning (FL) has the potential to enhance
learning across multiple robots without centralized data aggregation, its use
in multi-Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) target tracking remains largely
underexplored. Key challenges include limited onboard computational resources,
significant data heterogeneity in FL due to varying targets and the fields of
view, and the need for tight coupling between trajectory prediction and
multi-robot planning. In this paper, we introduce DroneFL, the first federated
learning framework specifically designed for efficient multi-UAV target
tracking. We design a lightweight local model to predict target trajectories
from sensor inputs, using a frozen YOLO backbone and a shallow transformer for
efficient onboard training. The updated models are periodically aggregated in
the cloud for global knowledge sharing. To alleviate the data heterogeneity
that hinders FL convergence, DroneFL introduces a position-invariant model
architecture with altitude-based adaptive instance normalization. Finally, we
fuse predictions from multiple UAVs in the cloud and generate optimal
trajectories that balance target prediction accuracy and overall tracking
performance. Our results show that DroneFL reduces prediction error by 6%-83%
and tracking distance by 0.4%-4.6% compared to a distributed non-FL framework.
In terms of efficiency, DroneFL runs in real time on a Raspberry Pi 5 and has
on average just 1.56 KBps data rate to the cloud.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将规划领域主要作为搜索工具，忽视了其作为可扩展推理数据源的潜力，同时机器人领域的思维链监督仍依赖昂贵的人工标注数据集。

Method: 基础模型生成规划领域作为引擎，产生符号问题-规划对作为推理轨迹，然后通过自然语言解释转化为扩展的思维链轨迹，明确对齐符号规划结构与自然语言推理。

Result: 生成的数据超越了模型内在规划能力，通过微调产生规划增强的LLM，提高了规划成功率、跨任务泛化能力，并降低了推理成本。

Conclusion: Plan2Evolve框架成功实现了LLM的自我进化，通过自动生成规划数据显著提升了模型的规划性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently shown strong potential in robotic
task planning, particularly through automatic planning domain generation that
integrates symbolic search. Prior approaches, however, have largely treated
these domains as search utilities, with limited attention to their potential as
scalable sources of reasoning data. At the same time, progress in reasoning
LLMs has been driven by chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision, whose application
in robotics remains dependent on costly, human-curated datasets. We propose
Plan2Evolve, an LLM self-evolving framework in which the base model generates
planning domains that serve as engines for producing symbolic problem-plan
pairs as reasoning traces. These pairs are then transformed into extended CoT
trajectories by the same model through natural-language explanations, thereby
explicitly aligning symbolic planning structures with natural language
reasoning. The resulting data extend beyond the model's intrinsic planning
capacity, enabling model fine-tuning that yields a planning-enhanced LLM with
improved planning success, stronger cross-task generalization, and reduced
inference costs.

Abstract: Vision-based odometry has been widely adopted in autonomous driving owing to
its low cost and lightweight setup; however, its performance often degrades in
complex outdoor urban environments. To address these challenges, we propose
PL-VIWO2, a filter-based visual-inertial-wheel odometry system that integrates
an IMU, wheel encoder, and camera (supporting both monocular and stereo) for
long-term robust state estimation. The main contributions are: (i) a novel line
feature processing framework that exploits the geometric relationship between
2D feature points and lines, enabling fast and robust line tracking and
triangulation while ensuring real-time performance; (ii) an SE(2)-constrained
SE(3) wheel pre-integration method that leverages the planar motion
characteristics of ground vehicles for accurate wheel updates; and (iii) an
efficient motion consistency check (MCC) that filters out dynamic features by
jointly using IMU and wheel measurements. Extensive experiments on Monte Carlo
simulations and public autonomous driving datasets demonstrate that PL-VIWO2
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and
robustness.

Abstract: Autonomous docking between Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and ground robots
is essential for heterogeneous systems, yet most existing approaches target
wheeled platforms whose limited mobility constrains exploration in complex
terrains. Quadruped robots offer superior adaptability but undergo frequent
posture variations, making it difficult to provide a stable landing surface for
UAVs. To address these challenges, we propose an autonomous UAV-quadruped
docking framework for GPS-denied environments. On the quadruped side, a Hybrid
Internal Model with Horizontal Alignment (HIM-HA), learned via deep
reinforcement learning, actively stabilizes the torso to provide a level
platform. On the UAV side, a three-phase strategy is adopted, consisting of
long-range acquisition with a median-filtered YOLOv8 detector, close-range
tracking with a constraint-aware controller that integrates a Nonsingular Fast
Terminal Sliding Mode Controller (NFTSMC) and a logarithmic Barrier Function
(BF) to guarantee finite-time error convergence under field-of-view (FOV)
constraints, and terminal descent guided by a Safety Period (SP) mechanism that
jointly verifies tracking accuracy and platform stability. The proposed
framework is validated in both simulation and real-world scenarios,
successfully achieving docking on outdoor staircases higher than 17 cm and
rough slopes steeper than 30 degrees. Supplementary materials and videos are
available at: https://uav-quadruped-docking.github.io.

Motivation: 物体级SLAM由于稀疏观测导致优化不足，传统方法获取常识先验知识费时且缺乏跨类别泛化能力。

Method: 集成LLM提供的物体尺寸和方向常识知识作为先验因子，构建图SLAM框架，实现稀疏物体特征上的鲁棒数据关联。

Conclusion: LLM提供的常识先验能有效提升物体级SLAM在稀疏观测条件下的性能，实现实时鲁棒建图。

Abstract: Object-level Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), which incorporates
semantic information for high-level scene understanding, faces challenges of
under-constrained optimization due to sparse observations. Prior work has
introduced additional constraints using commonsense knowledge, but obtaining
such priors has traditionally been labor-intensive and lacks generalizability
across diverse object categories. We address this limitation by leveraging
large language models (LLMs) to provide commonsense knowledge of object
geometric attributes, specifically size and orientation, as prior factors in a
graph-based SLAM framework. These priors are particularly beneficial during the
initial phase when object observations are limited. We implement a complete
pipeline integrating these priors, achieving robust data association on sparse
object-level features and enabling real-time object SLAM. Our system, evaluated
on the TUM RGB-D and 3RScan datasets, improves mapping accuracy by 36.8\% over
the latest baseline. Additionally, we present real-world experiments in the
supplementary video, demonstrating its real-time performance.

TL;DR: 提出了一种将稳定性直接集成到扩散模型采样过程中的方法，通过离线采样规划器收集多模态放置标签，训练扩散模型生成稳定放置，无需额外训练即可提高采样稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在多物体场景中稳定放置物体是机器人操作的基本挑战，现有方法依赖仿真引擎或启发式评估，无法直接集成稳定性到生成过程中。

Method: 使用离线采样规划器收集多模态放置标签，训练条件扩散模型生成稳定放置，利用基于分数的生成模型组合性结合稳定性感知损失。

Result: 在四个基准场景上评估，物理引导模型相比最先进几何方法，对强力扰动的鲁棒性提高56%，运行时间减少47%。

Conclusion: 该方法成功将物理稳定性集成到扩散模型中，无需额外训练即可显著提高放置稳定性和效率。

Abstract: Stably placing an object in a multi-object scene is a fundamental challenge
in robotic manipulation, as placements must be penetration-free, establish
precise surface contact, and result in a force equilibrium. To assess
stability, existing methods rely on running a simulation engine or resort to
heuristic, appearance-based assessments. In contrast, our approach integrates
stability directly into the sampling process of a diffusion model. To this end,
we query an offline sampling-based planner to gather multi-modal placement
labels and train a diffusion model to generate stable placements. The diffusion
model is conditioned on scene and object point clouds, and serves as a
geometry-aware prior. We leverage the compositional nature of score-based
generative models to combine this learned prior with a stability-aware loss,
thereby increasing the likelihood of sampling from regions of high stability.
Importantly, this strategy requires no additional re-training or fine-tuning,
and can be directly applied to off-the-shelf models. We evaluate our method on
four benchmark scenes where stability can be accurately computed. Our
physics-guided models achieve placements that are 56% more robust to forceful
perturbations while reducing runtime by 47% compared to a state-of-the-art
geometric method.

Abstract: Humanoid table tennis (TT) demands rapid perception, proactive whole-body
motion, and agile footwork under strict timing -- capabilities that remain
difficult for unified controllers. We propose a reinforcement learning
framework that maps ball-position observations directly to whole-body joint
commands for both arm striking and leg locomotion, strengthened by predictive
signals and dense, physics-guided rewards. A lightweight learned predictor, fed
with recent ball positions, estimates future ball states and augments the
policy's observations for proactive decision-making. During training, a
physics-based predictor supplies precise future states to construct dense,
informative rewards that lead to effective exploration. The resulting policy
attains strong performance across varied serve ranges (hit rate $\geq$ 96% and
success rate $\geq$ 92%) in simulations. Ablation studies confirm that both the
learned predictor and the predictive reward design are critical for end-to-end
learning. Deployed zero-shot on a physical Booster T1 humanoid with 23 revolute
joints, the policy produces coordinated lateral and forward-backward footwork
with accurate, fast returns, suggesting a practical path toward versatile,
competitive humanoid TT.

Conclusion: 通过将人类先验知识与视觉语言锚定适应相结合，为非结构化环境中的实用双手机器人操作迈出了重要一步

Abstract: Achieving generalizable bimanual manipulation requires systems that can learn
efficiently from minimal human input while adapting to real-world uncertainties
and diverse embodiments. Existing approaches face a dilemma: imitation policy
learning demands extensive demonstrations to cover task variations, while
modular methods often lack flexibility in dynamic scenes. We introduce VLBiMan,
a framework that derives reusable skills from a single human example through
task-aware decomposition, preserving invariant primitives as anchors while
dynamically adapting adjustable components via vision-language grounding. This
adaptation mechanism resolves scene ambiguities caused by background changes,
object repositioning, or visual clutter without policy retraining, leveraging
semantic parsing and geometric feasibility constraints. Moreover, the system
inherits human-like hybrid control capabilities, enabling mixed synchronous and
asynchronous use of both arms. Extensive experiments validate VLBiMan across
tool-use and multi-object tasks, demonstrating: (1) a drastic reduction in
demonstration requirements compared to imitation baselines, (2) compositional
generalization through atomic skill splicing for long-horizon tasks, (3)
robustness to novel but semantically similar objects and external disturbances,
and (4) strong cross-embodiment transfer, showing that skills learned from
human demonstrations can be instantiated on different robotic platforms without
retraining. By bridging human priors with vision-language anchored adaptation,
our work takes a step toward practical and versatile dual-arm manipulation in
unstructured settings.

Method: 设计了一个配备定制末端执行器的机器人操纵器，实现了五种土耳其冰淇淋风格的欺骗策略，通过混合设计用户研究（91名参与者）评估游戏性欺骗和互动时长对用户体验的影响。

Result: 土耳其冰淇淋风格的欺骗显著增强了愉悦感和参与度，但降低了感知安全性和信任度，表明在多维度方面存在结构化权衡。

Conclusion: 游戏性欺骗可以作为娱乐和参与导向情境下交互机器人的有价值设计策略，但需要仔细考虑其复杂的权衡关系。

Abstract: Playful deception, a common feature in human social interactions, remains
underexplored in Human-Robot Interaction (HRI). Inspired by the Turkish Ice
Cream (TIC) vendor routine, we investigate how bounded, culturally familiar
forms of deception influence user trust, enjoyment, and engagement during
robotic handovers. We design a robotic manipulator equipped with a custom
end-effector and implement five TIC-inspired trick policies that deceptively
delay the handover of an ice cream-shaped object. Through a mixed-design user
study with 91 participants, we evaluate the effects of playful deception and
interaction duration on user experience. Results reveal that TIC-inspired
deception significantly enhances enjoyment and engagement, though reduces
perceived safety and trust, suggesting a structured trade-off across the
multi-dimensional aspects. Our findings demonstrate that playful deception can
be a valuable design strategy for interactive robots in entertainment and
engagement-focused contexts, while underscoring the importance of deliberate
consideration of its complex trade-offs. You can find more information,

Abstract: Despite growing interest in developing legged robots that emulate biological
locomotion for agile navigation of complex environments, acquiring a diverse
repertoire of skills remains a fundamental challenge in robotics. Existing
methods can learn motion behaviors from expert data, but they often fail to
acquire multiple locomotion skills through a single policy and lack smooth
skill transitions. We propose a multi-skill learning framework based on
Conditional Adversarial Motion Priors (CAMP), with the aim of enabling
quadruped robots to efficiently acquire a diverse set of locomotion skills from
expert demonstrations. Precise skill reconstruction is achieved through a novel
skill discriminator and skill-conditioned reward design. The overall framework
supports the active control and reuse of multiple skills, providing a practical
solution for learning generalizable policies in complex environments.

Abstract: Conventional maneuver prediction methods use some sort of classification
model on temporal trajectory data to predict behavior of agents over a set time
horizon. Despite of having the best precision and recall, these models cannot
predict a lane change accurately unless they incorporate information about the
entire scene. Level-k game theory can leverage the human-like hierarchical
reasoning to come up with the most rational decisions each agent can make in a
group. This can be leveraged to model interactions between different vehicles
in presence of each other and hence compute the most rational decisions each
agent would make. The result of game theoretic evaluation can be used as a
"prior" or combined with a traditional motion-based classification model to
achieve more accurate predictions. The proposed approach assumes that the
states of the vehicles around the target lead vehicle are known. The module
will output the most rational maneuver prediction of the target vehicle based
on an online optimization solution. These predictions are instrumental in
decision making systems like Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) or Traxen's
iQ-Cruise further improving the resulting fuel savings.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于蜗轮的自适应可变弹性执行器WAVE，通过非反向驱动的蜗轮将驱动电机与外力解耦，实现精确的力传递和位置顺应性，同时通过弹簧存储弹性能量来保护执行器免受过载。

Motivation: 开发能够同时调节柔性和刚度的机器人操作器，以增强操作安全性和多功能性，特别是在接触密集型任务和挑战性环境中。

Method: 使用非反向驱动的蜗轮将驱动电机与外部力解耦，通过改变弹簧的预压缩长度实现连续关节刚度调节，并将冲击力转化为存储在弹簧中的弹性能量。

Conclusion: WAVE执行器展示了成功的外力解耦能力，其保护特性允许在接触密集型任务中延长操作时间，并在挑战性环境中实现稳健的机器人应用。

Abstract: Robotic manipulators capable of regulating both compliance and stiffness
offer enhanced operational safety and versatility. Here, we introduce Worm
Gear-based Adaptive Variable Elasticity (WAVE), a variable stiffness actuator
(VSA) that integrates a non-backdrivable worm gear. By decoupling the driving
motor from external forces using this gear, WAVE enables precise force
transmission to the joint, while absorbing positional discrepancies through
compliance. WAVE is protected from excessive loads by converting impact forces
into elastic energy stored in a spring. In addition, the actuator achieves
continuous joint stiffness modulation by changing the spring's precompression
length. We demonstrate these capabilities, experimentally validate the proposed
stiffness model, show that motor loads approach zero at rest--even under
external loading--and present applications using a manipulator with WAVE. This
outcome showcases the successful decoupling of external forces. The protective
attributes of this actuator allow for extended operation in contact-intensive
tasks, and for robust robotic applications in challenging environments.

Motivation: 解决长视野操作任务中的挑战，包括扩展动作序列和复杂物体交互，弥合高层符号规划与低层连续控制之间的差距。

Conclusion: SAGE框架通过场景图有效连接了任务级语义推理和像素级视觉运动控制，为解决长视野操作任务提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Successfully solving long-horizon manipulation tasks remains a fundamental
challenge. These tasks involve extended action sequences and complex object
interactions, presenting a critical gap between high-level symbolic planning
and low-level continuous control. To bridge this gap, two essential
capabilities are required: robust long-horizon task planning and effective
goal-conditioned manipulation. Existing task planning methods, including
traditional and LLM-based approaches, often exhibit limited generalization or
sparse semantic reasoning. Meanwhile, image-conditioned control methods
struggle to adapt to unseen tasks. To tackle these problems, we propose SAGE, a
novel framework for Scene Graph-Aware Guidance and Execution in Long-Horizon
Manipulation Tasks. SAGE utilizes semantic scene graphs as a structural
representation for scene states. A structural scene graph enables bridging
task-level semantic reasoning and pixel-level visuo-motor control. This also
facilitates the controllable synthesis of accurate, novel sub-goal images. SAGE
consists of two key components: (1) a scene graph-based task planner that uses
VLMs and LLMs to parse the environment and reason about physically-grounded
scene state transition sequences, and (2) a decoupled structural image editing
pipeline that controllably converts each target sub-goal graph into a
corresponding image through image inpainting and composition. Extensive
experiments have demonstrated that SAGE achieves state-of-the-art performance
on distinct long-horizon tasks.

TL;DR: 提出可学习共形预测(LCP)方法，用轻量级神经网络替代固定非共形分数，生成上下文感知的不确定性集合，在保持理论保证的同时显著提升机器人任务性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型在机器人应用中输出点估计且置信度校准不佳，无法量化新输入、噪声或分布外输入的预测可靠性。标准共形预测依赖固定非共形分数，忽略上下文且可能产生过于保守或不安全的区间

Method: LCP使用轻量级神经网络函数，利用几何、语义和任务特定特征生成上下文感知的不确定性集合，替代固定的非共形分数

Result: 在七个基准测试的三个机器人任务中，LCP始终优于标准CP和集成基线。分类任务中集合大小减少4.7-9.9%，目标检测中边界框缩小46-54%，路径规划成功率从72%提升至91.5%，路径膨胀仅4.5%

Conclusion: LCP是轻量级方法(4.8%运行时开销，42KB内存)，支持在线适应，适合资源受限的自主系统，在保持理论保证的同时显著改善预测性能

Abstract: Deep learning models in robotics often output point estimates with poorly
calibrated confidences, offering no native mechanism to quantify predictive
reliability under novel, noisy, or out-of-distribution inputs. Conformal
prediction (CP) addresses this gap by providing distribution-free coverage
guarantees, yet its reliance on fixed nonconformity scores ignores context and
can yield intervals that are overly conservative or unsafe. We address this
with Learnable Conformal Prediction (LCP), which replaces fixed scores with a
lightweight neural function that leverages geometric, semantic, and
task-specific features to produce context-aware uncertainty sets.
  LCP maintains CP's theoretical guarantees while reducing prediction set sizes
by 18% in classification, tightening detection intervals by 52%, and improving
path planning safety from 72% to 91% success with minimal overhead. Across
three robotic tasks on seven benchmarks, LCP consistently outperforms Standard
CP and ensemble baselines. In classification on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet, it
achieves smaller set sizes (4.7-9.9% reduction) at target coverage. For object
detection on COCO, BDD100K, and Cityscapes, it produces 46-54% tighter bounding
boxes. In path planning through cluttered environments, it improves success to
91.5% with only 4.5% path inflation, compared to 12.2% for Standard CP.
  The method is lightweight (approximately 4.8% runtime overhead, 42 KB memory)
and supports online adaptation, making it well suited to resource-constrained
autonomous systems. Hardware evaluation shows LCP adds less than 1% memory and
15.9% inference overhead, yet sustains 39 FPS on detection tasks while being
7.4 times more energy-efficient than ensembles.

TL;DR: FlowDrive是一个基于流匹配的轨迹规划器，通过条件修正流将噪声直接映射到轨迹分布，并使用调节式引导增加轨迹多样性，在nuPlan和interPlan基准测试中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决学习型规划器对驾驶数据长尾分布的敏感性问题，常见操作在数据集中占主导地位，而危险或罕见场景稀疏，这种不平衡会导致模型偏向频繁情况，在关键场景中性能下降。

Method: 提出FlowDrive流匹配轨迹规划器，学习条件修正流以少量流匹配步骤将噪声映射到轨迹分布；引入调节式闭环引导，在流步骤之间注入小扰动来系统性地增加轨迹多样性，同时保持场景一致性。

Result: 在nuPlan和交互导向的interPlan基准测试中，FlowDrive在学习型规划器中达到最先进结果，接近基于规则优化的方法；添加调节式引导和轻量后处理后（FlowDrive*），在几乎所有基准分割中都实现了整体最先进性能。

Conclusion: FlowDrive通过流匹配和调节式引导有效解决了数据不平衡问题，在轨迹规划任务中表现出色，为学习型规划器在长尾分布场景下的应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Learning-based planners are sensitive to the long-tailed distribution of
driving data. Common maneuvers dominate datasets, while dangerous or rare
scenarios are sparse. This imbalance can bias models toward the frequent cases
and degrade performance on critical scenarios. To tackle this problem, we
compare balancing strategies for sampling training data and find reweighting by
trajectory pattern an effective approach. We then present FlowDrive, a
flow-matching trajectory planner that learns a conditional rectified flow to
map noise directly to trajectory distributions with few flow-matching steps. We
further introduce moderated, in-the-loop guidance that injects small
perturbation between flow steps to systematically increase trajectory diversity
while remaining scene-consistent. On nuPlan and the interaction-focused
interPlan benchmarks, FlowDrive achieves state-of-the-art results among
learning-based planners and approaches methods with rule-based refinements.
After adding moderated guidance and light post-processing (FlowDrive*), it
achieves overall state-of-the-art performance across nearly all benchmark
splits.

Conclusion: 混合扩散方法有效解决了长时域任务中的决策混淆问题，为复杂机器人任务规划提供了新思路。

Abstract: Constructing robots to accomplish long-horizon tasks is a long-standing
challenge within artificial intelligence. Approaches using generative methods,
particularly Diffusion Models, have gained attention due to their ability to
model continuous robotic trajectories for planning and control. However, we
show that these models struggle with long-horizon tasks that involve complex
decision-making and, in general, are prone to confusing different modes of
behavior, leading to failure. To remedy this, we propose to augment continuous
trajectory generation by simultaneously generating a high-level symbolic plan.
We show that this requires a novel mix of discrete variable diffusion and
continuous diffusion, which dramatically outperforms the baselines. In
addition, we illustrate how this hybrid diffusion process enables flexible
trajectory synthesis, allowing us to condition synthesized actions on partial
and complete symbolic conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自我中心视频提供了丰富的物体操作运动线索，相比昂贵的人工遥操作训练方式更具可扩展性，但现有方法依赖辅助标注，需要探索能否直接从原始自我中心视频训练VLA模型。

Method: 使用EgoScaler框架从四个大规模自我中心视频数据集中提取6DoF物体操作轨迹，自动精炼噪声或不完整轨迹，构建新的VLA预训练数据集。

Result: 在模拟和真实机器人环境中，使用π₀架构的实验显示：预训练后任务成功率提升超过20%；性能与真实机器人数据集相当；结合两种数据可进一步改进性能。

Conclusion: 自我中心视频是推进VLA研究的有前景且可扩展的资源，能够有效替代昂贵的专家驱动训练方式。

Abstract: Egocentric videos capture how humans manipulate objects and tools, providing
diverse motion cues for learning object manipulation. Unlike the costly,
expert-driven manual teleoperation commonly used in training
Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs), egocentric videos offer a scalable
alternative. However, prior studies that leverage such videos for training
robot policies typically rely on auxiliary annotations, such as detailed
hand-pose recordings. Consequently, it remains unclear whether VLAs can be
trained directly from raw egocentric videos. In this work, we address this
challenge by leveraging EgoScaler, a framework that extracts 6DoF object
manipulation trajectories from egocentric videos without requiring auxiliary
recordings. We apply EgoScaler to four large-scale egocentric video datasets
and automatically refine noisy or incomplete trajectories, thereby constructing
a new large-scale dataset for VLA pre-training. Our experiments with a
state-of-the-art $\pi_0$ architecture in both simulated and real-robot
environments yield three key findings: (i) pre-training on our dataset improves
task success rates by over 20\% compared to training from scratch, (ii) the
performance is competitive with that achieved using real-robot datasets, and
(iii) combining our dataset with real-robot data yields further improvements.
These results demonstrate that egocentric videos constitute a promising and
scalable resource for advancing VLA research.

Motivation: 虽然多自由度仿生机器人肢体备受期待，但单自由度设计仍具有简单性、鲁棒性、成本效益和效率等优势。多连杆和旋转关节构成的机构能为1-DoF系统引入运动多样性，但通常受到全周期运动范围内自碰撞的限制。

Abstract: While it is expected to build robotic limbs with multiple degrees of freedom
(DoF) inspired by nature, a single DoF design remains fundamental, providing
benefits that include, but are not limited to, simplicity, robustness,
cost-effectiveness, and efficiency. Mechanisms, especially those with multiple
links and revolute joints connected in closed loops, play an enabling factor in
introducing motion diversity for 1-DoF systems, which are usually constrained
by self-collision during a full-cycle range of motion. This study presents a
novel computational approach to designing one-degree-of-freedom (1-DoF)
overconstrained robotic limbs for a desired spatial trajectory, while achieving
energy-efficient, self-collision-free motion in full-cycle rotations. Firstly,
we present the geometric optimization problem of linkage-based robotic limbs in
a generalized formulation for self-collision-free design. Next, we formulate
the spatial trajectory generation problem with the overconstrained linkages by
optimizing the similarity and dynamic-related metrics. We further optimize the
geometric shape of the overconstrained linkage to ensure smooth and
collision-free motion driven by a single actuator. We validated our proposed
method through various experiments, including personalized automata and
bio-inspired hexapod robots. The resulting hexapod robot, featuring
overconstrained robotic limbs, demonstrated outstanding energy efficiency
during forward walking.

Abstract: As a key technology for autonomous navigation and positioning in mobile
robots, light detection and ranging (LiDAR) odometry is widely used in
autonomous driving applications. The Iterative Closest Point (ICP)-based
methods have become the core technique in LiDAR odometry due to their efficient
and accurate point cloud registration capability. However, some existing
ICP-based methods do not consider the reliability of the initial pose, which
may cause the method to converge to a local optimum. Furthermore, the absence
of an adaptive mechanism hinders the effective handling of complex dynamic
environments, resulting in a significant degradation of registration accuracy.
To address these issues, this paper proposes an adaptive ICP-based LiDAR
odometry method that relies on a reliable initial pose. First, distributed
coarse registration based on density filtering is employed to obtain the
initial pose estimation. The reliable initial pose is then selected by
comparing it with the motion prediction pose, reducing the initial error
between the source and target point clouds. Subsequently, by combining the
current and historical errors, the adaptive threshold is dynamically adjusted
to accommodate the real-time changes in the dynamic environment. Finally, based
on the reliable initial pose and the adaptive threshold, point-to-plane
adaptive ICP registration is performed from the current frame to the local map,
achieving high-precision alignment of the source and target point clouds.
Extensive experiments on the public KITTI dataset demonstrate that the proposed
method outperforms existing approaches and significantly enhances the accuracy
of LiDAR odometry.

Abstract: In-situ robotic exploration is an important tool for advancing knowledge of
geological processes that describe the Earth and other Planetary bodies. To
inform and enhance operations for these roving laboratories, it is imperative
to understand the terramechanical properties of their environments, especially
for traversing on loose, deformable substrates. Recent research suggested that
legged robots with direct-drive and low-gear ratio actuators can sensitively
detect external forces, and therefore possess the potential to measure terrain
properties with their legs during locomotion, providing unprecedented sampling
speed and density while accessing terrains previously too risky to sample. This
paper explores these ideas by investigating the impact of gait on
proprioceptive terrain sensing accuracy, particularly comparing a
sensing-oriented gait, Crawl N' Sense, with a locomotion-oriented gait,
Trot-Walk. Each gait's ability to measure the strength and texture of
deformable substrate is quantified as the robot locomotes over a laboratory
transect consisting of a rigid surface, loose sand, and loose sand with
synthetic surface crusts. Our results suggest that with both the
sensing-oriented crawling gait and locomotion-oriented trot gait, the robot can
measure a consistent difference in the strength (in terms of penetration
resistance) between the low- and high-resistance substrates; however, the
locomotion-oriented trot gait contains larger magnitude and variance in
measurements. Furthermore, the slower crawl gait can detect brittle ruptures of
the surface crusts with significantly higher accuracy than the faster trot
gait. Our results offer new insights that inform legged robot "sensing during
locomotion" gait design and planning for scouting the terrain and producing
scientific measurements on other worlds to advance our understanding of their
geology and formation.

Conclusion: ADP为高效机器人策略提供了简单的即插即用路径，推进了机器人操作的效率和性能前沿。

Abstract: Robotic manipulation with Vision-Language-Action models requires efficient
inference over long-horizon multi-modal context, where attention to dense
visual tokens dominates computational cost. Existing methods optimize inference
speed by reducing visual redundancy within VLA models, but they overlook the
varying redundancy across robotic manipulation stages. We observe that the
visual token redundancy is higher in coarse manipulation phase than in
fine-grained operations, and is strongly correlated with the action dynamic.
Motivated by this observation, we propose \textbf{A}ction-aware
\textbf{D}ynamic \textbf{P}runing (\textbf{ADP}), a multi-modal pruning
framework that integrates text-driven token selection with action-aware
trajectory gating. Our method introduces a gating mechanism that conditions the
pruning signal on recent action trajectories, using past motion windows to
adaptively adjust token retention ratios in accordance with dynamics, thereby
balancing computational efficiency and perceptual precision across different
manipulation stages. Extensive experiments on the LIBERO suites and diverse
real-world scenarios demonstrate that our method significantly reduces FLOPs
and action inference latency (\textit{e.g.} $1.35 \times$ speed up on
OpenVLA-OFT) while maintaining competitive success rates (\textit{e.g.} 25.8\%
improvements with OpenVLA) compared to baselines, thereby providing a simple
plug-in path to efficient robot policies that advances the efficiency and
performance frontier of robotic manipulation. Our project website is:

Conclusion: 多阶段NMPC方法能有效处理外骨骼机器人控制中的不确定性，显著降低交互力，提高系统鲁棒性和跟踪精度。

Abstract: The use of exoskeleton robots is increasing due to the rising number of
musculoskeletal injuries. However, their effectiveness depends heavily on the
design of control systems. Designing robust controllers is challenging because
of uncertainties in human-robot systems. Among various control strategies,
Model Predictive Control (MPC) is a powerful approach due to its ability to
handle constraints and optimize performance. Previous studies have used
linearization-based methods to implement robust MPC on exoskeletons, but these
can degrade performance due to nonlinearities in the robot's dynamics. To
address this gap, this paper proposes a Robust Nonlinear Model Predictive
Control (RNMPC) method, called multi-stage NMPC, to control a
two-degree-of-freedom exoskeleton by solving a nonlinear optimization problem.
This method uses multiple scenarios to represent system uncertainties. The
study focuses on minimizing human-robot interaction forces during the swing
phase, particularly when the robot carries unknown loads. Simulations and
experimental tests show that the proposed method significantly improves
robustness, outperforming non-robust NMPC. It achieves lower tracking errors
and interaction forces under various uncertainties. For instance, when a 2 kg
unknown payload is combined with external disturbances, the RMS values of thigh
and shank interaction forces for multi-stage NMPC are reduced by 77 and 94
percent, respectively, compared to non-robust NMPC.

Abstract: Universal grasping with multi-fingered dexterous hands is a fundamental
challenge in robotic manipulation. While recent approaches successfully learn
closed-loop grasping policies using reinforcement learning (RL), the inherent
difficulty of high-dimensional, long-horizon exploration necessitates complex
reward and curriculum design, often resulting in suboptimal solutions across
diverse objects. We propose DemoGrasp, a simple yet effective method for
learning universal dexterous grasping. We start from a single successful
demonstration trajectory of grasping a specific object and adapt to novel
objects and poses by editing the robot actions in this trajectory: changing the
wrist pose determines where to grasp, and changing the hand joint angles
determines how to grasp. We formulate this trajectory editing as a single-step
Markov Decision Process (MDP) and use RL to optimize a universal policy across
hundreds of objects in parallel in simulation, with a simple reward consisting
of a binary success term and a robot-table collision penalty. In simulation,
DemoGrasp achieves a 95% success rate on DexGraspNet objects using the Shadow
Hand, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods. It also shows strong
transferability, achieving an average success rate of 84.6% across diverse
dexterous hand embodiments on six unseen object datasets, while being trained
on only 175 objects. Through vision-based imitation learning, our policy
successfully grasps 110 unseen real-world objects, including small, thin items.
It generalizes to spatial, background, and lighting changes, supports both RGB
and depth inputs, and extends to language-guided grasping in cluttered scenes.

Abstract: Learning to generate dual-hand grasps that respect object semantics is
essential for robust hand-object interaction but remains largely underexplored
due to dataset scarcity. Existing grasp datasets predominantly focus on
single-hand interactions and contain only limited semantic part annotations. To
address these challenges, we introduce a pipeline, SymOpt, that constructs a
large-scale dual-hand grasp dataset by leveraging existing single-hand datasets
and exploiting object and hand symmetries. Building on this, we propose a
text-guided dual-hand grasp generator, DHAGrasp, that synthesizes Dual-Hand
Affordance-aware Grasps for unseen objects. Our approach incorporates a novel
dual-hand affordance representation and follows a two-stage design, which
enables effective learning from a small set of segmented training objects while
scaling to a much larger pool of unsegmented data. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method produces diverse and semantically consistent
grasps, outperforming strong baselines in both grasp quality and generalization
to unseen objects. The project page is at

TL;DR: VLM2VLA是一种新的视觉语言动作模型训练方法，通过将低级动作表示为自然语言来解决预训练数据与机器人微调数据之间的分布不匹配问题，使用LoRA微调避免灾难性遗忘。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在微调视觉语言模型以适应机器人遥操作数据时，会导致模型丧失原有的推理和多模态理解能力，阻碍泛化到新场景、指令跟随和语义理解。

Method: 将低级动作表示为自然语言来对齐数据分布，然后仅使用低秩适应（LoRA）进行微调，最小化对VLM骨干网络的修改。

Result: 通过广泛的视觉问答研究和800多次真实世界机器人实验，证明VLM2VLA能保持VLM的核心能力，实现对新任务的零样本泛化，支持开放世界语义推理和多语言指令跟随。

Conclusion: VLM2VLA通过数据级对齐和LoRA微调，成功解决了VLA训练中的灾难性遗忘问题，为训练通用策略提供了有效范式。

Abstract: Fine-tuning vision-language models (VLMs) on robot teleoperation data to
create vision-language-action (VLA) models is a promising paradigm for training
generalist policies, but it suffers from a fundamental tradeoff: learning to
produce actions often diminishes the VLM's foundational reasoning and
multimodal understanding, hindering generalization to novel scenarios,
instruction following, and semantic understanding. We argue that this
catastrophic forgetting is due to a distribution mismatch between the VLM's
internet-scale pretraining corpus and the robotics fine-tuning data. Inspired
by this observation, we introduce VLM2VLA: a VLA training paradigm that first
resolves this mismatch at the data level by representing low-level actions with
natural language. This alignment makes it possible to train VLAs solely with
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), thereby minimally modifying the VLM backbone and
averting catastrophic forgetting. As a result, the VLM can be fine-tuned on
robot teleoperation data without fundamentally altering the underlying
architecture and without expensive co-training on internet-scale VLM datasets.
Through extensive Visual Question Answering (VQA) studies and over 800
real-world robotics experiments, we demonstrate that VLM2VLA preserves the
VLM's core capabilities, enabling zero-shot generalization to novel tasks that
require open-world semantic reasoning and multilingual instruction following.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 收集机器人交互数据成本高昂，而人类演示视频更具可扩展性和成本效益，但存在视觉、视角和动作方面的领域差距。

Method: 提出MimicDreamer框架，包含H2R Aligner进行视觉对齐生成机器人演示视频，EgoStabilizer进行视角稳定化处理，以及动作映射和逆运动学求解器实现动作对齐。

Result: 仅使用合成的人类到机器人视频训练的VLA模型能在真实机器人上实现少样本执行，相比仅使用真实机器人数据训练的模型，在六个代表性操作任务上平均成功率提升14.7%。

Conclusion: 通过将人类演示转化为机器人可用监督数据，可以显著提升VLA模型的性能，同时降低数据收集成本。

Abstract: Vision Language Action (VLA) models derive their generalization capability
from diverse training data, yet collecting embodied robot interaction data
remains prohibitively expensive. In contrast, human demonstration videos are
far more scalable and cost-efficient to collect, and recent studies confirm
their effectiveness in training VLA models. However, a significant domain gap
persists between human videos and robot-executed videos, including unstable
camera viewpoints, visual discrepancies between human hands and robotic arms,
and differences in motion dynamics. To bridge this gap, we propose
MimicDreamer, a framework that turns fast, low-cost human demonstrations into
robot-usable supervision by jointly aligning vision, viewpoint, and actions to
directly support policy training. For visual alignment, we propose H2R Aligner,
a video diffusion model that generates high-fidelity robot demonstration videos
by transferring motion from human manipulation footage. For viewpoint
stabilization, EgoStabilizer is proposed, which canonicalizes egocentric videos
via homography and inpaints occlusions and distortions caused by warping. For
action alignment, we map human hand trajectories to the robot frame and apply a
constrained inverse kinematics solver to produce feasible, low-jitter joint
commands with accurate pose tracking. Empirically, VLA models trained purely on
our synthesized human-to-robot videos achieve few-shot execution on real
robots. Moreover, scaling training with human data significantly boosts
performance compared to models trained solely on real robot data; our approach
improves the average success rate by 14.7\% across six representative
manipulation tasks.

TL;DR: Super-Mimic是一个分层框架，通过从无脚本的人类演示视频中直接推断程序意图，实现零样本机器人模仿。它包含人类意图翻译器和未来动态预测器两个模块，显著优于现有零样本方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决机器人在零样本设置下泛化到长时程操作任务的核心挑战。当前基于多模态基础的方法通常无法仅从静态视觉输入将高级命令分解为可执行的动作序列。

Method: 分层框架：1) 人类意图翻译器(HIT)使用多模态推理解析输入视频，生成语言基础化的子任务序列；2) 未来动态预测器(FDP)使用生成模型为每个步骤合成物理上合理的视频展开，生成动态感知的视觉轨迹。

Result: 在长时程操作任务套件上的广泛实验表明，Super-Mimic显著优于最先进的零样本方法，性能提升超过20%。

Conclusion: 将视频驱动的意图解析与前瞻性动态建模相结合，是开发通用机器人系统的高度有效策略。

Abstract: Generalizing to long-horizon manipulation tasks in a zero-shot setting
remains a central challenge in robotics. Current multimodal foundation based
approaches, despite their capabilities, typically fail to decompose high-level
commands into executable action sequences from static visual input alone. To
address this challenge, we introduce Super-Mimic, a hierarchical framework that
enables zero-shot robotic imitation by directly inferring procedural intent
from unscripted human demonstration videos. Our framework is composed of two
sequential modules. First, a Human Intent Translator (HIT) parses the input
video using multimodal reasoning to produce a sequence of language-grounded
subtasks. These subtasks then condition a Future Dynamics Predictor (FDP),
which employs a generative model that synthesizes a physically plausible video
rollout for each step. The resulting visual trajectories are dynamics-aware,
explicitly modeling crucial object interactions and contact points to guide the
low-level controller. We validate this approach through extensive experiments
on a suite of long-horizon manipulation tasks, where Super-Mimic significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art zero-shot methods by over 20\%. These results
establish that coupling video-driven intent parsing with prospective dynamics
modeling is a highly effective strategy for developing general-purpose robotic
systems.

Motivation: 有语言障碍的儿童需要支持来加强表达能力，传统方法需要专业人士具备精确的语言知识和实时生成能力，这对教育者和家长来说很困难。

Method: 开发了使用Furhat对话机器人和大型语言模型的应用程序，通过玩"Alias"单词检索游戏来改善语言技能，LLM负责游戏管理、对话、情感响应和轮换。

Result: 目前应用已能管理游戏和对话，下一步将利用LLM在游戏中生成和传递特定的形态目标，预计机器人在这方面能超越人类表现。

Conclusion: 长期目标是创建基于LLM的机器人辅助语言学习干预系统，能够跨语言教授各种形态结构，机器人可作为儿童和专业人士的榜样和导师。

Abstract: Preschool children with language vulnerabilities -- such as developmental
language disorders or immigration related language challenges -- often require
support to strengthen their expressive language skills. Based on the principle
of implicit learning, speech-language therapists (SLTs) typically embed target
morphological structures (e.g., third person -s) into everyday interactions or
game-based learning activities. Educators are recommended by SLTs to do the
same. This approach demands precise linguistic knowledge and real-time
production of various morphological forms (e.g., "Daddy wears these when he
drives to work"). The task becomes even more demanding when educators or parent
also must keep children engaged and manage turn-taking in a game-based
activity. In the TalBot project our multiprofessional team have developed an
application in which the Furhat conversational robot plays the word retrieval
game "Alias" with children to improve language skills. Our application
currently employs a large language model (LLM) to manage gameplay, dialogue,
affective responses, and turn-taking. Our next step is to further leverage the
capacity of LLMs so the robot can generate and deliver specific morphological
targets during the game. We hypothesize that a robot could outperform humans at
this task. Novel aspects of this approach are that the robot could ultimately
serve as a model and tutor for both children and professionals and that using
LLM capabilities in this context would support basic communication needs for
children with language vulnerabilities. Our long-term goal is to create a
robust LLM-based Robot-Assisted Language Learning intervention capable of
teaching a variety of morphological structures across different languages.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统固定滞后雷达-LiDAR-惯性平滑器为每个测量创建因子图节点，导致状态创建率翻倍，计算成本高，难以在资源受限硬件上实现实时性能

Method: 引入IMU预积分雷达因子，利用高频惯性数据将最新LiDAR状态传播到雷达测量时间戳，保持节点创建率为LiDAR测量频率

Result: 在单板计算机上实验表明，该方法保持了传统基线的绝对位姿误差，同时将因子图优化时间降低了高达56%

Conclusion: IMU预积分雷达因子方法显著降低了计算成本，同时保持了定位精度，使雷达-LiDAR-惯性系统能够在资源受限硬件上实现实时性能

Abstract: Fixed-lag Radar-LiDAR-Inertial smoothers conventionally create one factor
graph node per measurement to compensate for the lack of time synchronization
between radar and LiDAR. For a radar-LiDAR sensor pair with equal rates, this
strategy results in a state creation rate of twice the individual sensor
frequencies. This doubling of the number of states per second yields high
optimization costs, inhibiting real-time performance on resource-constrained
hardware. We introduce IMU-preintegrated radar factors that use high-rate
inertial data to propagate the most recent LiDAR state to the radar measurement
timestamp. This strategy maintains the node creation rate at the LiDAR
measurement frequency. Assuming equal sensor rates, this lowers the number of
nodes by 50 % and consequently the computational costs. Experiments on a single
board computer (which has 4 cores each of 2.2 GHz A73 and 2 GHz A53 with 8 GB
RAM) show that our method preserves the absolute pose error of a conventional
baseline while simultaneously lowering the aggregated factor graph optimization
time by up to 56 %.

Abstract: Hospital patient falls remain a critical and costly challenge worldwide.
While conventional fall prevention systems typically rely on post-fall
detection or reactive alerts, they also often suffer from high false positive
rates and fail to address the underlying patient needs that lead to bed-exit
attempts. This paper presents a novel system architecture that leverages the
Internet of Robotic Things (IoRT) to orchestrate human-robot-robot interaction
for proactive and personalized patient assistance. The system integrates a
privacy-preserving thermal sensing model capable of real-time bed-exit
prediction, with two coordinated robotic agents that respond dynamically based
on predicted intent and patient input. This orchestrated response could not
only reduce fall risk but also attend to the patient's underlying motivations
for movement, such as thirst, discomfort, or the need for assistance, before a
hazardous situation arises. Our contributions with this pilot study are
three-fold: (1) a modular IoRT-based framework enabling distributed sensing,
prediction, and multi-robot coordination; (2) a demonstration of low-resolution
thermal sensing for accurate, privacy-preserving preemptive bed-exit detection;
and (3) results from a user study and systematic error analysis that inform the
design of situationally aware, multi-agent interactions in hospital settings.
The findings highlight how interactive and connected robotic systems can move
beyond passive monitoring to deliver timely, meaningful assistance, empowering
safer, more responsive care environments.

Method: 采用结构化变体生成框架和感知公平验证协议，创建2127个任务实例，系统评估三个代表性具身智能体在两种主流范式下的表现。

Result: 发现所有智能体都存在显著视觉偏见，相机视角是最关键因素；智能体在高度饱和颜色上成功率最高，表明继承了底层VLM的视觉偏好；视觉偏见呈现强不对称耦合，视角会放大颜色相关偏见。

Conclusion: 系统分析视觉偏见是开发安全可靠通用具身智能体的先决条件，提出的基于语义接地层的缓解策略能显著减少视觉偏见。

Abstract: The safety and reliability of embodied agents rely on accurate and unbiased
visual perception. However, existing benchmarks mainly emphasize generalization
and robustness under perturbations, while systematic quantification of visual
bias remains scarce. This gap limits a deeper understanding of how perception
influences decision-making stability. To address this issue, we propose
RoboView-Bias, the first benchmark specifically designed to systematically
quantify visual bias in robotic manipulation, following a principle of factor
isolation. Leveraging a structured variant-generation framework and a
perceptual-fairness validation protocol, we create 2,127 task instances that
enable robust measurement of biases induced by individual visual factors and
their interactions. Using this benchmark, we systematically evaluate three
representative embodied agents across two prevailing paradigms and report three
key findings: (i) all agents exhibit significant visual biases, with camera
viewpoint being the most critical factor; (ii) agents achieve their highest
success rates on highly saturated colors, indicating inherited visual
preferences from underlying VLMs; and (iii) visual biases show strong,
asymmetric coupling, with viewpoint strongly amplifying color-related bias.
Finally, we demonstrate that a mitigation strategy based on a semantic
grounding layer substantially reduces visual bias by approximately 54.5\% on
MOKA. Our results highlight that systematic analysis of visual bias is a
prerequisite for developing safe and reliable general-purpose embodied agents.

Conclusion: 结合触觉传感和学习型多智能体MPC，为复杂环境中的协作抓取提供了鲁棒智能解决方案，显著提升了多智能体系统的能力

Abstract: Grasping is a core task in robotics with various applications. However, most
current implementations are primarily designed for rigid items, and their
performance drops considerably when handling fragile or deformable materials
that require real-time feedback. Meanwhile, tactile-reactive grasping focuses
on a single agent, which limits their ability to grasp and manipulate large,
heavy objects. To overcome this, we propose a learning-based, tactile-reactive
multi-agent Model Predictive Controller (MPC) for grasping a wide range of
objects with different softness and shapes, beyond the capabilities of
preexisting single-agent implementations. Our system uses two Gelsight Mini
tactile sensors [1] to extract real-time information on object texture and
stiffness. This rich tactile feedback is used to estimate contact dynamics and
object compliance in real time, enabling the system to adapt its control policy
to diverse object geometries and stiffness profiles. The learned controller
operates in a closed loop, leveraging tactile encoding to predict grasp
stability and adjust force and position accordingly. Our key technical
contributions include a multi-agent MPC formulation trained on real contact
interactions, a tactile-data driven method for inferring grasping states, and a
coordination strategy that enables collaborative control. By combining tactile
sensing and a learning-based multi-agent MPC, our method offers a robust,
intelligent solution for collaborative grasping in complex environments,
significantly advancing the capabilities of multi-agent systems. Our approach
is validated through extensive experiments against independent PD and MPC
baselines. Our pipeline outperforms the baselines regarding success rates in
achieving and maintaining stable grasps across objects of varying sizes and
stiffness.

Conclusion: OntoBOT提供了一个统一的本体框架，能够有效支持服务机器人的任务执行推理和知识共享，解决了现有解决方案的隔离和硬编码问题。

Abstract: Personal service robots are increasingly used in domestic settings to assist
older adults and people requiring support. Effective operation involves not
only physical interaction but also the ability to interpret dynamic
environments, understand tasks, and choose appropriate actions based on
context. This requires integrating both hardware components (e.g. sensors,
actuators) and software systems capable of reasoning about tasks, environments,
and robot capabilities. Frameworks such as the Robot Operating System (ROS)
provide open-source tools that help connect low-level hardware with
higher-level functionalities. However, real-world deployments remain tightly
coupled to specific platforms. As a result, solutions are often isolated and
hard-coded, limiting interoperability, reusability, and knowledge sharing.
Ontologies and knowledge graphs offer a structured way to represent tasks,
environments, and robot capabilities. Existing ontologies, such as the
Socio-physical Model of Activities (SOMA) and the Descriptive Ontology for
Linguistic and Cognitive Engineering (DOLCE), provide models for activities,
spatial relationships, and reasoning structures. However, they often focus on
specific domains and do not fully capture the connection between environment,
action, robot capabilities, and system-level integration. In this work, we
propose the Ontology for roBOts and acTions (OntoBOT), which extends existing
ontologies to provide a unified representation of tasks, actions, environments,
and capabilities. Our contributions are twofold: (1) we unify these aspects
into a cohesive ontology to support formal reasoning about task execution, and
(2) we demonstrate its generalizability by evaluating competency questions
across four embodied agents - TIAGo, HSR, UR3, and Stretch - showing how
OntoBOT enables context-aware reasoning, task-oriented execution, and knowledge
sharing in service robotics.

Abstract: This paper presents UnderwaterVLA, a novel framework for autonomous
underwater navigation that integrates multimodal foundation models with
embodied intelligence systems. Underwater operations remain difficult due to
hydrodynamic disturbances, limited communication bandwidth, and degraded
sensing in turbid waters. To address these challenges, we introduce three
innovations. First, a dual-brain architecture decouples high-level mission
reasoning from low-level reactive control, enabling robust operation under
communication and computational constraints. Second, we apply
Vision-Language-Action(VLA) models to underwater robotics for the first time,
incorporating structured chain-of-thought reasoning for interpretable
decision-making. Third, a hydrodynamics-informed Model Predictive Control(MPC)
scheme compensates for fluid effects in real time without costly task-specific
training. Experimental results in field tests show that UnderwaterVLA reduces
navigation errors in degraded visual conditions while maintaining higher task
completion by 19% to 27% over baseline. By minimizing reliance on
underwater-specific training data and improving adaptability across
environments, UnderwaterVLA provides a scalable and cost-effective path toward
the next generation of intelligent AUVs.

Abstract: This paper proposes a task allocation algorithm for teams of heterogeneous
robots in environments with uncertain task requirements. We model these

resources. We introduce a market-based approach that optimizes the joint team
objective while explicitly capturing coupled rewards between robots, offering a
polynomial-time solution in decentralized settings with strict communication
assumptions. Comparative experiments against benchmark algorithms demonstrate
the effectiveness of our approach and highlight the challenges of incorporating
coupled rewards in a decentralized formulation.

Abstract: Mutual understanding of artificial agents' decisions is key to ensuring a
trustworthy and successful human-robot interaction. Hence, robots are expected
to make reasonable decisions and communicate them to humans when needed. In
this article, the focus is on an approach to modeling and reasoning about the
comparison of two competing plans, so that robots can later explain the
divergent result. First, a novel ontological model is proposed to formalize and
reason about the differences between competing plans, enabling the
classification of the most appropriate one (e.g., the shortest, the safest, the
closest to human preferences, etc.). This work also investigates the
limitations of a baseline algorithm for ontology-based explanatory narration.
To address these limitations, a novel algorithm is presented, leveraging

*Katrina Ashton,Chahyon Ku,Shrey Shah,Wen Jiang,Kostas Daniilidis,Bernadette Bucher*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: HELIOS是一个分层场景表示系统，用于语言指定的移动操作任务，在部分观察的场景中通过平衡探索和利用来高效搜索目标物体。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在部分观察的新环境中执行语言指定移动操作任务时面临的挑战：场景部分观察、语言指令到部分观察场景的语义信息接地、以及用新观察主动更新场景知识。

Method: 构建包含语义和占据信息的2D地图，同时主动构建任务相关物体的3D高斯表示，融合多层表示中的观察，并显式建模每个物体检测的多视角一致性。

Result: 在OVMM基准测试中达到最先进水平，能够零样本迁移到真实世界，在Spot机器人上成功演示。

Conclusion: HELIOS通过分层场景表示和平衡探索与利用的搜索目标，有效解决了语言指定移动操作任务中的感知挑战。

Abstract: Language-specified mobile manipulation tasks in novel environments
simultaneously face challenges interacting with a scene which is only partially
observed, grounding semantic information from language instructions to the
partially observed scene, and actively updating knowledge of the scene with new
observations. To address these challenges, we propose HELIOS, a hierarchical
scene representation and associated search objective to perform language
specified pick and place mobile manipulation tasks. We construct 2D maps
containing the relevant semantic and occupancy information for navigation while
simultaneously actively constructing 3D Gaussian representations of
task-relevant objects. We fuse observations across this multi-layered
representation while explicitly modeling the multi-view consistency of the
detections of each object. In order to efficiently search for the target
object, we formulate an objective function balancing exploration of unobserved
or uncertain regions with exploitation of scene semantic information. We
evaluate HELIOS on the OVMM benchmark in the Habitat simulator, a pick and
place benchmark in which perception is challenging due to large and complex
scenes with comparatively small target objects. HELIOS achieves
state-of-the-art results on OVMM. As our approach is zero-shot, HELIOS can also
transfer to the real world without requiring additional data, as we illustrate
by demonstrating it in a real world office environment on a Spot robot.

TL;DR: 提出了一种意图驱动的车道变换框架，通过驾驶风格识别、合作感知决策和协调运动规划，在混合交通环境中实现安全高效的车道变换。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在自动驾驶车辆与人类驾驶车辆混合的交通环境中，不可预测的意图和异质行为使得安全高效的车道变换极具挑战性，现有方法往往过度简化这些交互。

Method: 使用深度学习分类器实时识别人类驾驶风格；通过包含内在和交互分量的合作评分估计周围驾驶员的意图；结合行为克隆和逆强化学习进行决策；集成模型预测控制和IRL意图推理生成轨迹。

Result: 模型达到94.2%准确率和94.3% F1分数，在车道变换识别方面比基于规则和学习的方法提升4-15%。

Conclusion: 结果表明建模驾驶员异质性的益处，展示了该框架在复杂交通环境中推进情境感知和类人自动驾驶的潜力。

Abstract: In mixed-traffic environments, where autonomous vehicles (AVs) interact with
diverse human-driven vehicles (HVs), unpredictable intentions and heterogeneous
behaviors make safe and efficient lane change maneuvers highly challenging.
Existing methods often oversimplify these interactions by assuming uniform
patterns. We propose an intention-driven lane change framework that integrates
driving-style recognition, cooperation-aware decision-making, and coordinated
motion planning. A deep learning classifier trained on the NGSIM dataset
identifies human driving styles in real time. A cooperation score with
intrinsic and interactive components estimates surrounding drivers' intentions
and quantifies their willingness to cooperate with the ego vehicle.
Decision-making combines behavior cloning with inverse reinforcement learning
to determine whether a lane change should be initiated. For trajectory
generation, model predictive control is integrated with IRL-based intention
inference to produce collision-free and socially compliant maneuvers.
Experiments show that the proposed model achieves 94.2\% accuracy and 94.3\%
F1-score, outperforming rule-based and learning-based baselines by 4-15\% in
lane change recognition. These results highlight the benefit of modeling
inter-driver heterogeneity and demonstrate the potential of the framework to
advance context-aware and human-like autonomous driving in complex traffic
environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法大多依赖多模态输入（如RGB-D），且存在类别不平衡问题，影响模型训练和泛化能力。需要开发仅使用RGB输入、能快速响应并提高服务质量的交互意图检测方法。

Method: 提出了MINT-RVAE合成序列生成方法，结合新的损失函数和训练策略，仅使用RGB输入实现帧级精度的交互意图预测。

Conclusion: 该方法在人机交互意图预测中实现了最先进性能，解决了类别不平衡问题，并公开了新的帧级标注数据集以支持未来研究。

Abstract: Efficiently detecting human intent to interact with ubiquitous robots is
crucial for effective human-robot interaction (HRI) and collaboration. Over the
past decade, deep learning has gained traction in this field, with most
existing approaches relying on multimodal inputs, such as RGB combined with
depth (RGB-D), to classify time-sequence windows of sensory data as interactive
or non-interactive. In contrast, we propose a novel RGB-only pipeline for
predicting human interaction intent with frame-level precision, enabling faster
robot responses and improved service quality. A key challenge in intent
prediction is the class imbalance inherent in real-world HRI datasets, which
can hinder the model's training and generalization. To address this, we
introduce MINT-RVAE, a synthetic sequence generation method, along with new
loss functions and training strategies that enhance generalization on
out-of-sample data. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance (AUROC:
0.95) outperforming prior works (AUROC: 0.90-0.912), while requiring only RGB
input and supporting precise frame onset prediction. Finally, to support future
research, we openly release our new dataset with frame-level labeling of human
interaction intent.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模仿学习策略在机器人操作中表现良好，但在单一自我中心视角训练后，在自我中心视角变化下性能会下降。

Method: 提出EgoDemoGen框架，通过重定向动作到新自我中心坐标系，并使用提出的生成视频修复模型EgoViewTransfer合成相应的自我中心观察视频。EgoViewTransfer基于预训练视频生成模型，使用自监督双重重投影策略进行微调。

Result: 在模拟环境中，使用EgoDemoGen生成的新自我中心演示和原始标准自我中心演示混合训练后，策略在标准自我中心视角下的成功率绝对提升+17.0%，在新自我中心视角下提升+17.7%。在真实机器人上，绝对提升分别为+18.3%和+25.8%。

Conclusion: EgoDemoGen为自我中心视角鲁棒的机器人操作提供了一条实用路径，性能随着EgoDemoGen生成演示比例的增加而持续提升（收益递减）。

Abstract: Imitation learning based policies perform well in robotic manipulation, but
they often degrade under *egocentric viewpoint shifts* when trained from a
single egocentric viewpoint. To address this issue, we present **EgoDemoGen**,
a framework that generates *paired* novel egocentric demonstrations by
retargeting actions in the novel egocentric frame and synthesizing the
corresponding egocentric observation videos with proposed generative video
repair model **EgoViewTransfer**, which is conditioned by a novel-viewpoint
reprojected scene video and a robot-only video rendered from the retargeted
joint actions. EgoViewTransfer is finetuned from a pretrained video generation
model using self-supervised double reprojection strategy. We evaluate
EgoDemoGen on both simulation (RoboTwin2.0) and real-world robot. After
training with a mixture of EgoDemoGen-generated novel egocentric demonstrations
and original standard egocentric demonstrations, policy success rate improves
**absolutely** by **+17.0%** for standard egocentric viewpoint and by
**+17.7%** for novel egocentric viewpoints in simulation. On real-world robot,
the **absolute** improvements are **+18.3%** and **+25.8%**. Moreover,
performance continues to improve as the proportion of EgoDemoGen-generated
demonstrations increases, with diminishing returns. These results demonstrate
that EgoDemoGen provides a practical route to egocentric viewpoint-robust
robotic manipulation.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了WoW模型，这是一个基于200万机器人交互轨迹训练的140亿参数生成世界模型，通过主动交互而非被动观察来发展物理直觉，并在物理一致性基准上取得最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类通过主动交互发展物理直觉，而当前视频模型（如Sora）依赖被动观察，难以理解物理因果关系。假设真实的物理直觉必须基于与真实世界的大量、因果丰富的交互。

Method: 开发WoW模型，使用SOPHIA方法通过视觉语言模型代理评估DiT生成输出并迭代演化语言指令来约束物理真实性，同时训练逆动力学模型将精炼计划转化为可执行机器人动作。

Result: WoW在物理一致性基准WoWBench上取得最先进性能，在物理因果关系、碰撞动力学和物体持久性方面表现出强大能力。模型对物理的理解是可能结果的概率分布，会出现随机不稳定性和物理幻觉。

Conclusion: 大规模真实世界交互是发展AI物理直觉的基石。模型、数据和基准将开源。

Abstract: Humans develop an understanding of intuitive physics through active
interaction with the world. This approach is in stark contrast to current video
models, such as Sora, which rely on passive observation and therefore struggle
with grasping physical causality. This observation leads to our central
hypothesis: authentic physical intuition of the world model must be grounded in
extensive, causally rich interactions with the real world. To test this
hypothesis, we present WoW, a 14-billion-parameter generative world model
trained on 2 million robot interaction trajectories. Our findings reveal that
the model's understanding of physics is a probabilistic distribution of
plausible outcomes, leading to stochastic instabilities and physical
hallucinations. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this emergent capability can
be actively constrained toward physical realism by SOPHIA, where
vision-language model agents evaluate the DiT-generated output and guide its
refinement by iteratively evolving the language instructions. In addition, a
co-trained Inverse Dynamics Model translates these refined plans into
executable robotic actions, thus closing the imagination-to-action loop. We
establish WoWBench, a new benchmark focused on physical consistency and causal
reasoning in video, where WoW achieves state-of-the-art performance in both
human and autonomous evaluation, demonstrating strong ability in physical
causality, collision dynamics, and object permanence. Our work provides
systematic evidence that large-scale, real-world interaction is a cornerstone
for developing physical intuition in AI. Models, data, and benchmarks will be
open-sourced.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLA模型只能预测短视的下一步动作，在长时程轨迹任务中因增量偏差而表现不佳，需要增强其预见能力。

Method: 提出VLA-Reasoner框架，使用世界模型生成未来状态，结合MCTS提高搜索效率，引入基于KDE的置信度采样机制减少冗余查询，采用离线奖励策略评估中间状态。

Result: 在仿真和真实世界实验中，VLA-Reasoner相比最先进的VLA模型取得了显著改进。

Conclusion: 该方法为机器人操作的可扩展测试时计算提供了一条潜在路径。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) achieve strong performance in general
robotic manipulation tasks by scaling imitation learning. However, existing
VLAs are limited to predicting short-sighted next-action, which struggle with
long-horizon trajectory tasks due to incremental deviations. To address this
problem, we propose a plug-in framework named VLA-Reasoner that effectively
empowers off-the-shelf VLAs with the capability of foreseeing future states via
test-time scaling. Specifically, VLA-Reasoner samples and rolls out possible
action trajectories where involved actions are rationales to generate future
states via a world model, which enables VLA-Reasoner to foresee and reason
potential outcomes and search for the optimal actions. We further leverage
Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to improve search efficiency in large action
spaces, where stepwise VLA predictions seed the root. Meanwhile, we introduce a
confidence sampling mechanism based on Kernel Density Estimation (KDE), to
enable efficient exploration in MCTS without redundant VLA queries. We evaluate
intermediate states in MCTS via an offline reward shaping strategy, to score
predicted futures and correct deviations with long-term feedback. We conducted
extensive experiments in both simulators and the real world, demonstrating that
our proposed VLA-Reasoner achieves significant improvements over the
state-of-the-art VLAs. Our method highlights a potential pathway toward
scalable test-time computation of robotic manipulation.

Abstract: We present DAWN (Diffusion is All We Need for robot control), a unified
diffusion-based framework for language-conditioned robotic manipulation that
bridges high-level motion intent and low-level robot action via structured

controllers are modeled as diffusion processes, yielding a fully trainable,
end-to-end system with interpretable intermediate motion abstractions. DAWN
achieves state-of-the-art results on the challenging CALVIN benchmark,
demonstrating strong multi-task performance, and further validates its
effectiveness on MetaWorld. Despite the substantial domain gap between
simulation and reality and limited real-world data, we demonstrate reliable
real-world transfer with only minimal finetuning, illustrating the practical
viability of diffusion-based motion abstractions for robotic control. Our
results show the effectiveness of combining diffusion modeling with
motion-centric representations as a strong baseline for scalable and robust
robot learning. Project page: https://nero1342.github.io/DAWN/

Motivation: 现有基于VLM的方法将动作预测视为文本生成任务，而本文认为空中视觉语言导航的动作预测应该被视为2D空间定位任务，以更有效地处理模糊语言指令。

Method: 利用VLM将模糊语言指令分解为输入图像上的迭代2D航点标注，结合预测的移动距离，将2D航点转换为3D位移向量作为无人机动作指令，并自适应调整移动距离。

Result: 在DRL仿真基准测试中创下新纪录，比之前最佳方法绝对提升63%；在真实世界评估中大幅优于强基线方法；展现出对不同VLM的显著泛化能力。

Conclusion: SPF框架通过将动作预测重新定义为2D空间定位任务，实现了在任意环境中基于任意自由形式指令的无人机导航，在仿真和真实环境中都表现出色。

Abstract: We present See, Point, Fly (SPF), a training-free aerial vision-and-language
navigation (AVLN) framework built atop vision-language models (VLMs). SPF is
capable of navigating to any goal based on any type of free-form instructions
in any kind of environment. In contrast to existing VLM-based approaches that
treat action prediction as a text generation task, our key insight is to
consider action prediction for AVLN as a 2D spatial grounding task. SPF
harnesses VLMs to decompose vague language instructions into iterative
annotation of 2D waypoints on the input image. Along with the predicted
traveling distance, SPF transforms predicted 2D waypoints into 3D displacement
vectors as action commands for UAVs. Moreover, SPF also adaptively adjusts the
traveling distance to facilitate more efficient navigation. Notably, SPF
performs navigation in a closed-loop control manner, enabling UAVs to follow
dynamic targets in dynamic environments. SPF sets a new state of the art in DRL
simulation benchmark, outperforming the previous best method by an absolute
margin of 63%. In extensive real-world evaluations, SPF outperforms strong
baselines by a large margin. We also conduct comprehensive ablation studies to
highlight the effectiveness of our design choice. Lastly, SPF shows remarkable
generalization to different VLMs. Project page: https://spf-web.pages.dev

Conclusion: 该方法为食品零售流程分析提供了有效工具，通过优化库存管理策略显著减少食品浪费，同时确保产品供应充足。

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel method for analyzing food retail processes with a
focus on reducing food waste. The approach integrates object-centric process
mining (OCPM) with stochastic process discovery and analysis. First, a
stochastic process in the form of a continuous-time Markov chain is discovered
from grocery store sales data. This model is then extended with supply
activities. Finally, a what-if analysis is conducted to evaluate how the
quantity of products in the store evolves over time. This enables the
identification of an optimal balance between customer purchasing behavior and
supply strategies, helping to prevent both food waste due to oversupply and
product shortages.

Abstract: Physics Informed Neural Networks offer a mesh free framework for solving PDEs
but are highly sensitive to loss weight selection. We propose two dimensional

also incorporating unquantifiable terms for more balanced training. Benchmarks
on heat conduction, convection diffusion, and lid driven cavity flows show that

Result: LLM代理对实验反馈不敏感，经典方法表现更好，LLMNN方法在不同领域都取得了竞争性或更优的性能

Conclusion: 当前LLMs无法实际执行上下文实验设计，需要将基于先验的推理与更新后验的批量获取解耦的混合框架

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently been proposed as general-purpose
agents for experimental design, with claims that they can perform in-context
experimental design. We evaluate this hypothesis using both open- and
closed-source instruction-tuned LLMs applied to genetic perturbation and
molecular property discovery tasks. We find that LLM-based agents show no
sensitivity to experimental feedback: replacing true outcomes with randomly
permuted labels has no impact on performance. Across benchmarks, classical
methods such as linear bandits and Gaussian process optimization consistently
outperform LLM agents. We further propose a simple hybrid method, LLM-guided
Nearest Neighbour (LLMNN) sampling, that combines LLM prior knowledge with
nearest-neighbor sampling to guide the design of experiments. LLMNN achieves
competitive or superior performance across domains without requiring
significant in-context adaptation. These results suggest that current open- and
closed-source LLMs do not perform in-context experimental design in practice
and highlight the need for hybrid frameworks that decouple prior-based
reasoning from batch acquisition with updated posteriors.

Motivation: 解决数据无关持续模型融合中的核心挑战：如何在参数空间优化中确保对先前任务的透明度（不干扰）和对新任务的保真度（忠实适应），而无需访问任务数据。

Method: 提出零空间过滤方法，通过投影器过滤新任务向量中的重叠组件来保持透明度；使用轻量级LoRA适配器注入补充任务特定信号来实现保真度；采用基于投影的替代损失训练适配器。

Conclusion: NUFILT通过零空间过滤和适配机制有效解决了数据无关模型融合的透明度和保真度问题，理论上有子空间对齐保证，实践中在多个基准测试中表现优异。

Abstract: Data-free continual model merging (DFCMM) aims to fuse independently
fine-tuned models into a single backbone that evolves with incoming tasks
without accessing task data. This paper formulate two fundamental desiderata
for DFCMM: transparency, avoiding interference with earlier tasks, and
fidelity, adapting faithfully to each new task. This poses a challenge that
existing approaches fail to address: how to bridge data-level desiderata with
parameter-space optimization to ensure transparency and fidelity in the absence
of task data. To this end, we propose NUFILT (NUll-space FILTering), a
data-free framework that directly links these desiderata to optimization. Our
key observation is that task vectors approximately align with representation
subspaces, providing structural surrogates for enforcing transparency and
fidelity. Accordingly, we design a null-space projector that preserves prior
responses by filtering out overlapping components of new task vectors, thereby
ensuring transparency, and a lightweight LoRA adapter that injects
complementary task-specific signals, enabling fidelity in adapting to new
tasks. The adapter is trained with a projection-based surrogate loss to retain
consistency with previous knowledge while introducing novel directions. This
joint filtering-adaptation process allows the backbone to absorb new knowledge
while retaining existing behaviors, and the updates are finally fused back in a
layer-wise linear fashion without extra parameters or inference cost.
Theoretically, we establish approximate subspace alignment guarantees that
justify null-space filtering. Empirically, NUFILT achieves state-of-the-art
performance with minimal forgetting on both vision and NLP benchmarks,
improving average accuracy by 4-7% over OPCM and WUDI-Merging, while narrowing
the gap to fine-tuning and reducing computation overhead.

Abstract: We introduce \textit{SeismoGPT}, a transformer-based model for forecasting
three-component seismic waveforms in the context of future gravitational wave
detectors like the Einstein Telescope. The model is trained in an
autoregressive setting and can operate on both single-station and array-based
inputs. By learning temporal and spatial dependencies directly from waveform
data, SeismoGPT captures realistic ground motion patterns and provides accurate
short-term forecasts. Our results show that the model performs well within the
immediate prediction window and gradually degrades further ahead, as expected
in autoregressive systems. This approach lays the groundwork for data-driven
seismic forecasting that could support Newtonian noise mitigation and real-time
observatory control.

Abstract: Tabular foundation models are becoming increasingly popular for low-resource
tabular problems. These models make up for small training datasets by
pretraining on large volumes of synthetic data. The prior knowledge obtained
via pretraining provides the exceptional performance, but the resulting model
becomes a black box that is difficult to interpret and costly to inference. In
this work, we explore an alternative strategy: using reasoning-capable LLMs to
induce decision trees for small tabular datasets in agentic setup. We design a
minimal set of tools for constructing, analyzing and manipulating decision
trees. By using these tools, LLMs combine their prior knowledge with learning
from data to create a lightweight decision tree that outperforms traditional
CART on low-resource tabular problems. While a single decision tree does not
outperform state-of-the-art black box models, it comes with a human-readable
reasoning trace that can be checked for biases and data leaks. Furthermore, the
reasoning-based LLM's creation process allows for additional human input:
correcting biases or incorporating domain-specific intuition that is not
captured in the data.

TL;DR: SIGN方法通过从预训练扩散模型中提取idempotent模型，结合了扩散模型和idempotent生成网络的优点，实现了稳定训练和快速推理，支持多步采样和零样本编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统IGNs需要对抗训练且容易不稳定，而扩散模型虽然稳定但计算成本高。本文旨在结合两者的优势，开发既稳定又高效的生成模型。

Method: 从预训练扩散模型的分数中提取idempotent模型，避免对抗损失，提供基于分数的训练方法理论分析。

Result: 在CIFAR和CelebA数据集上实现了idempotent模型的最先进结果，支持多步采样和零样本编辑。

Conclusion: SIGN成功地将扩散模型和IGNs结合，实现了稳定训练、快速推理和灵活的质量-效率权衡。

Abstract: Idempotent generative networks (IGNs) are a new line of generative models
based on idempotent mapping to a target manifold. IGNs support both single-and
multi-step generation, allowing for a flexible trade-off between computational
cost and sample quality. But similar to Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs),
conventional IGNs require adversarial training and are prone to training
instabilities and mode collapse. Diffusion and score-based models are popular
approaches to generative modeling that iteratively transport samples from one
distribution, usually a Gaussian, to a target data distribution. These models
have gained popularity due to their stable training dynamics and high-fidelity
generation quality. However, this stability and quality come at the cost of
high computational cost, as the data must be transported incrementally along
the entire trajectory. New sampling methods, model distillation, and
consistency models have been developed to reduce the sampling cost and even
perform one-shot sampling from diffusion models. In this work, we unite
diffusion and IGNs by distilling idempotent models from diffusion model scores,
called SIGN. Our proposed method is highly stable and does not require
adversarial losses. We provide a theoretical analysis of our proposed
score-based training methods and empirically show that IGNs can be effectively
distilled from a pre-trained diffusion model, enabling faster inference than
iterative score-based models. SIGNs can perform multi-step sampling, allowing
users to trade off quality for efficiency. These models operate directly on the
source domain; they can project corrupted or alternate distributions back onto
the target manifold, enabling zero-shot editing of inputs. We validate our
models on multiple image datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results for
idempotent models on the CIFAR and CelebA datasets.

Method: 通过概率理论分析，提出幻觉率的高概率下界，并在硬币聚合、开放问答和文本到图像生成等任务上进行实验验证。

Result: 证明了最优估计器仍会产生幻觉，这是损失最小化与人类期望输出之间的根本性不匹配导致的校准错误。

Conclusion: 幻觉是损失最小化与人类可接受输出之间结构性错配的必然结果，需要重新思考生成模型的评估和优化方法。

Abstract: We formalize hallucinations in generative models as failures to link an
estimate to any plausible cause. Under this interpretation, we show that even
loss-minimizing optimal estimators still hallucinate. We confirm this with a
general high probability lower bound on hallucinate rate for generic data
distributions. This reframes hallucination as structural misalignment between
loss minimization and human-acceptable outputs, and hence estimation errors
induced by miscalibration. Experiments on coin aggregation, open-ended QA, and
text-to-image support our theory.

Conclusion: d2框架证明了扩散语言模型通过强化学习可以有效提升推理能力，无需监督微调即可实现优异性能

Abstract: While diffusion language models (DLMs) have achieved competitive performance
in text generation, improving their reasoning ability with reinforcement
learning remains an active research area. Here, we introduce d2, a reasoning
framework tailored for masked DLMs. Central to our framework is a new policy
gradient algorithm that relies on properties of masking to accurately estimate
the likelihoods of sampling trajectories. Our estimators trade off computation
for approximation accuracy in an analytically tractable manner, and are
particularly effective for DLMs that support any-order likelihood estimation.
We characterize and study this property in popular DLMs and show that it is key
for efficient diffusion-based reasoning. Empirically, d2 significantly improves
over previous diffusion reasoning frameworks using only RL (without relying on
supervised fine-tuning), and sets a new state-of-the-art performance for DLMs
on logical reasoning tasks (Countdown and Sudoku) and math reasoning benchmarks
(GSM8K and MATH500).

Abstract: Reconstructing subsurface ocean dynamics, such as vertical velocity fields,
from incomplete surface observations poses a critical challenge in Earth
science, a field long hampered by the lack of standardized, analysis-ready
benchmarks. To systematically address this issue and catalyze research, we
first build and release KD48, a high-resolution ocean dynamics benchmark
derived from petascale simulations and curated with expert-driven denoising.
Building on this benchmark, we introduce VISION, a novel reconstruction
paradigm based on Dynamic Prompting designed to tackle the core problem of
missing data in real-world observations. The essence of VISION lies in its
ability to generate a visual prompt on-the-fly from any available subset of
observations, which encodes both data availability and the ocean's physical
state. More importantly, we design a State-conditioned Prompting module that
efficiently injects this prompt into a universal backbone, endowed with
geometry- and scale-aware operators, to guide its adaptive adjustment of
computational strategies. This mechanism enables VISION to precisely handle the
challenges posed by varying input combinations. Extensive experiments on the
KD48 benchmark demonstrate that VISION not only substantially outperforms
state-of-the-art models but also exhibits strong generalization under extreme
data missing scenarios. By providing a high-quality benchmark and a robust
model, our work establishes a solid infrastructure for ocean science research
under data uncertainty. Our codes are available at:

Conclusion: 共形数据增强是一种有效的数据过滤方法，能够在保持数据多样性的同时控制风险，显著提升模型性能。

Abstract: With promising empirical performance across a wide range of applications,
synthetic data augmentation appears a viable solution to data scarcity and the
demands of increasingly data-intensive models. Its effectiveness lies in
expanding the training set in a way that reduces estimator variance while
introducing only minimal bias. Controlling this bias is therefore critical:
effective data augmentation should generate diverse samples from the same
underlying distribution as the training set, with minimal shifts. In this
paper, we propose conformal data augmentation, a principled data filtering
framework that leverages the power of conformal prediction to produce diverse
synthetic data while filtering out poor-quality generations with provable risk
control. Our method is simple to implement, requires no access to internal
model logits, nor large-scale model retraining. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach across multiple tasks, including topic
prediction, sentiment analysis, image classification, and fraud detection,
showing consistent performance improvements of up to 40% in F1 score over
unaugmented baselines, and 4% over other filtered augmentation baselines.

Result: FedZero在联邦凸设置下以高概率实现接近最优的优化误差界限，并在单工作器场景中首次建立了凸零阶优化的高概率收敛保证。

Conclusion: FedZero算法提供了强大的理论保证，其开发的浓度不等式工具不仅对高概率保证至关重要，也具有独立的研究价值。

Abstract: We study distributed learning in the setting of gradient-free zero-order
optimization and introduce FedZero, a federated zero-order algorithm that
delivers sharp theoretical guarantees. Specifically, FedZero: (1) achieves
near-optimal optimization error bounds with high probability in the federated
convex setting; and (2) in the single-worker regime-where the problem reduces
to the standard zero-order framework, establishes the first high-probability
convergence guarantees for convex zero-order optimization, thereby
strengthening the classical expectation-based results. At its core, FedZero
employs a gradient estimator based on randomization over the $\ell_1$-sphere.
To analyze it, we develop new concentration inequalities for Lipschitz
functions under the uniform measure on the $\ell_1$-sphere, with explicit
constants. These concentration tools are not only central to our
high-probability guarantees but may also be of independent interest.

Conclusion: 该方法为复杂储层系统的有效控制开辟了新机遇。

Abstract: This paper presents a method for modeling transient fluid flow in subsurface
reservoir systems based on the developed neural operator architecture
(TFNO-opt). Reservoir systems are complex dynamic objects with distributed
parameters described by systems of partial differential equations (PDEs).
Traditional numerical methods for modeling such systems, despite their high
accuracy, are characterized by significant time costs for performing
calculations, which limits their applicability in control and decision support
problems. The proposed architecture (TFNO-opt) is based on Fourier neural
operators, which allow approximating PDE solutions in infinite-dimensional
functional spaces, providing invariance to discretization and the possibility
of generalization to various implementations of equations. The developed
modifications are aimed at increasing the accuracy and stability of the trained
neural operator, which is especially important for control problems. These
include adjustable internal time resolution of the integral Fourier operator,
tensor decomposition of parameters in the spectral domain, use of the Sobolev
norm in the error function, and separation of approximation errors and
reconstruction of initial conditions for more accurate reproduction of physical
processes. The effectiveness of the proposed improvements is confirmed by
computational experiments. The practical significance is confirmed by
computational experiments using the example of the problem of hydrodynamic
modeling of an underground gas storage (UGS), where the acceleration of
calculations by six orders of magnitude was achieved, compared to traditional
methods. This opens up new opportunities for the effective control of complex
reservoir systems.

Conclusion: 在精心设计的先验分布上对合成图进行预训练是构建图基础模型的有效策略，GraphPFN展示了这一方法的成功应用。

Abstract: Foundation models pretrained on large-scale datasets have transformed such
fields as natural language processing and computer vision, but their
application to graph data remains limited. Recently emerged graph foundation
models, such as G2T-FM, utilize tabular foundation models for graph tasks and
were shown to significantly outperform prior attempts to create GFMs. However,
these models primarily rely on hand-crafted graph features, limiting their
ability to learn complex graph-specific patterns. In this work, we propose
GraphPFN: a prior-data fitted network for node-level prediction. First, we
design a prior distribution of synthetic attributed graphs. For graph structure
generation, we use a novel combination of multiple stochastic block models and
a preferential attachment process. We then apply graph-aware structured causal
models to generate node attributes and targets. This procedure allows us to
efficiently generate a wide range of realistic graph datasets. Then, we augment
the tabular foundation model LimiX with attention-based graph neighborhood
aggregation layers and train it on synthetic graphs sampled from our prior,
allowing the model to capture graph structural dependencies not present in
tabular data. On diverse real-world graph datasets with up to 50,000 nodes,
GraphPFN shows strong in-context learning performance and achieves
state-of-the-art results after finetuning, outperforming both G2T-FM and
task-specific GNNs trained from scratch on most datasets. More broadly, our
work demonstrates that pretraining on synthetic graphs from a well-designed
prior distribution is an effective strategy for building graph foundation
models.

Motivation: 扩散模型因数十亿参数和迭代去噪过程而计算昂贵，现有效率技术依赖微调或重新训练来恢复性能，存在瓶颈。

Method: 将扩散模型压缩重构为谱近似任务，利用去噪时间步的激活协方差定义低秩子空间，在固定压缩预算下指导动态剪枝，对功能权重组进行模块化分解。

Result: 在基线模型上实现35%加速和约1亿参数减少，生成质量与未压缩模型相当，仅需约500个校准样本，比先前方法少70倍以上。

Conclusion: 这是第一个无需训练、基于闭式解的激活引导扩散模型结构压缩方法，提供了理论清晰性和实际效率。

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs), lauded for their generative performance, are
computationally prohibitive due to their billion-scale parameters and iterative
denoising dynamics. Existing efficiency techniques, such as quantization,
timestep reduction, or pruning, offer savings in compute, memory, or runtime
but are strictly bottlenecked by reliance on fine-tuning or retraining to
recover performance. In this work, we introduce SlimDiff, an automated
activation-informed structural compression framework that reduces both
attention and feedforward dimensionalities in DMs, while being entirely
gradient-free. SlimDiff reframes DM compression as a spectral approximation
task, where activation covariances across denoising timesteps define low-rank
subspaces that guide dynamic pruning under a fixed compression budget. This
activation-aware formulation mitigates error accumulation across timesteps by
applying module-wise decompositions over functional weight groups: query--key
interactions, value--output couplings, and feedforward projections, rather than
isolated matrix factorizations, while adaptively allocating sparsity across
modules to respect the non-uniform geometry of diffusion trajectories. SlimDiff
achieves up to 35\% acceleration and $\sim$100M parameter reduction over
baselines, with generation quality on par with uncompressed models without any
backpropagation. Crucially, our approach requires only about 500 calibration
samples, over 70$\times$ fewer than prior methods. To our knowledge, this is
the first closed-form, activation-guided structural compression of DMs that is
entirely training-free, providing both theoretical clarity and practical
efficiency.

<details>

Motivation: 强化学习微调(RFT)经常遭受奖励过度优化问题，即模型通过欺骗奖励信号获得高分但生成低质量输出。理论分析表明关键在于高奖励区域的奖励规范不足，无法可靠区分优秀回答和良好回答。

Method: 研究基于评分标准的奖励机制，通过设计能够利用离策略示例同时对其伪影不敏感的评分标准。引入了一个工作流程来区分优秀且多样化的回答，从而引出能够捕捉高奖励区域的评分标准。

Conclusion: 基于评分标准的奖励机制是解决强化学习微调中奖励过度优化问题的有效方法，能够更好地利用离策略示例来提升模型对齐效果。

Abstract: Reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) often suffers from \emph{reward
over-optimization}, where a policy model hacks the reward signals to achieve
high scores while producing low-quality outputs. Our theoretical analysis shows
that the key lies in reward misspecification at the high-reward tail: the
inability to reliably distinguish Excellent responses from merely Great ones.
This motivate us to focus on the high-reward region. However, such tail
examples are scarce under the base LLM. While off-policy exemplars (e.g. from
stronger models or rewrites) are easier to obtain, naively training on them
yields a misspecified reward for the policy we aim to align. To address this,
we study rubric-based rewards. By design, rubrics can leverage off-policy
examples while remaining insensitive to their artifacts. To elicit rubrics that
capture the high-reward tail, we highlight the importance of distinguishing
among great and diverse responses, and introduce a workflow to implement this
idea. We empirically demonstrate that rubric-based rewards substantially
mitigate reward over-optimization and deliver effective LLM post-training
improvements. Our code can be accessed at

Conclusion: cMIM作为一个统一的表示学习框架，有效服务于判别性和生成性应用，推进了表示学习的目标。

Abstract: Learning representations that transfer well to diverse downstream tasks
remains a central challenge in representation learning. Existing paradigms --
contrastive learning, self-supervised masking, and denoising auto-encoders --
balance this challenge with different trade-offs. We introduce the {contrastive
Mutual Information Machine} (cMIM), a probabilistic framework that extends the
Mutual Information Machine (MIM) with a contrastive objective. While MIM
maximizes mutual information between inputs and latents and promotes clustering
of codes, it falls short on discriminative tasks. cMIM addresses this gap by
imposing global discriminative structure while retaining MIM's generative
fidelity. Our contributions are threefold. First, we propose cMIM, a
contrastive extension of MIM that removes the need for positive data
augmentation and is substantially less sensitive to batch size than InfoNCE.
Second, we introduce {informative embeddings}, a general technique for
extracting enriched features from encoder-decoder models that boosts
discriminative performance without additional training and applies broadly
beyond MIM. Third, we provide empirical evidence across vision and molecular
benchmarks showing that cMIM outperforms MIM and InfoNCE on classification and
regression tasks while preserving competitive reconstruction quality. These
results position cMIM as a unified framework for representation learning,
advancing the goal of models that serve both discriminative and generative
applications effectively.

Method: 使用阻尼波动方程和随机Kac表示，引入速度空间中的无分类器引导，提出端点蒸馏方法训练学生模型匹配冻结教师模型在长区间上的表现。

Result: 实验表明DistillKac能够以极少的函数评估次数生成高质量样本，同时保持有限速度概率流的数值稳定性优势。

Conclusion: DistillKac通过有限速度概率流和端点蒸馏，实现了高效稳定的图像生成，在保持质量的同时显著减少了计算成本。

Abstract: We present DistillKac, a fast image generator that uses the damped wave
equation and its stochastic Kac representation to move probability mass at
finite speed. In contrast to diffusion models whose reverse time velocities can
become stiff and implicitly allow unbounded propagation speed, Kac dynamics
enforce finite speed transport and yield globally bounded kinetic energy.
Building on this structure, we introduce classifier-free guidance in velocity
space that preserves square integrability under mild conditions. We then
propose endpoint only distillation that trains a student to match a frozen
teacher over long intervals. We prove a stability result that promotes
supervision at the endpoints to closeness along the entire path. Experiments
demonstrate DistillKac delivers high quality samples with very few function
evaluations while retaining the numerical stability benefits of finite speed
probability flows.

Abstract: While the phenomenon of grokking, i.e., delayed generalization, has been
studied extensively, it remains an open question whether there is a
mathematical framework to characterize what kind of features emerge, how and in
which conditions it happens from training, for complex structured inputs. We
propose a novel framework, named $\mathbf{Li_2}$, that captures three key
stages for the grokking behavior of 2-layer nonlinear networks: (I) Lazy
learning, (II) independent feature learning and (III) interactive feature
learning, characterized by the structure of backpropagated gradient $G_F$
across layers. In (I), $G_F$ is random, and top layer overfits to random hidden
representation. In (II), the gradient of each node (column of $G_F$) only
depends on its own activation, and thus each hidden node learns their
representation independently from $G_F$, which now carries information about
target labels, thanks to weight decay. Interestingly, the independent dynamics
follows exactly the gradient ascent of an energy function $E$, and its local
maxima are precisely the emerging features. We study whether these local-optima
induced features are generalizable, their representation power, and how they
change on sample size, in group arithmetic tasks. Finally, in (III), we
provably show how hidden nodes interact, and how $G_F$ changes to focus on
missing features that need to be learned. Our study sheds lights on roles
played by key hyperparameters such as weight decay, learning rate and sample
sizes in grokking, leads to provable scaling laws of memorization and
generalization, and reveals the underlying cause why recent optimizers such as
Muon can be effective, from the first principles of gradient dynamics. Our
analysis can be extended to multi-layer architectures.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TRiCo是一个新颖的三元博弈论协同训练框架，通过教师、两个学生和一个对抗生成器的结构化交互重新设计半监督学习范式，在低标签场景下实现最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有半监督学习框架的关键局限性，包括静态视图交互、不可靠伪标签以及缺乏困难样本建模等问题。

Method: 构建三元交互结构：两个学生分类器在互补表示上训练，元学习教师通过验证反馈自适应调节伪标签选择和损失平衡，非参数生成器扰动嵌入以发现决策边界弱点。使用互信息而非置信度选择伪标签，并将交互形式化为Stackelberg博弈。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、SVHN、STL-10和ImageNet上的广泛实验表明，TRiCo在低标签场景下始终达到最先进的性能，同时保持架构无关性并与冻结视觉骨干兼容。

Conclusion: TRiCo提供了一个原则性和可泛化的解决方案，通过三元博弈论协同训练框架有效解决了半监督学习中的关键挑战。

Abstract: We introduce TRiCo, a novel triadic game-theoretic co-training framework that
rethinks the structure of semi-supervised learning by incorporating a teacher,
two students, and an adversarial generator into a unified training paradigm.
Unlike existing co-training or teacher-student approaches, TRiCo formulates SSL
as a structured interaction among three roles: (i) two student classifiers
trained on frozen, complementary representations, (ii) a meta-learned teacher
that adaptively regulates pseudo-label selection and loss balancing via
validation-based feedback, and (iii) a non-parametric generator that perturbs
embeddings to uncover decision boundary weaknesses. Pseudo-labels are selected
based on mutual information rather than confidence, providing a more robust
measure of epistemic uncertainty. This triadic interaction is formalized as a
Stackelberg game, where the teacher leads strategy optimization and students
follow under adversarial perturbations. By addressing key limitations in
existing SSL frameworks, such as static view interactions, unreliable
pseudo-labels, and lack of hard sample modeling, TRiCo provides a principled
and generalizable solution. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, SVHN, STL-10,
and ImageNet demonstrate that TRiCo consistently achieves state-of-the-art
performance in low-label regimes, while remaining architecture-agnostic and
compatible with frozen vision backbones.

*Sathwik Karnik,Somil Bansal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BRT-Align是一个基于可达性分析的LLM安全对齐框架，在推理时通过可达性分析预测不安全内容并引导生成过程，提供比传统方法更早更准确的安全检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前主流的RLHF方法在训练时有效但推理时缺乏安全保障，LLM仍可能生成有害内容，需要推理时的安全控制机制。

Method: 将自回归生成建模为潜在空间中的动态系统，通过后向可达性学习安全价值函数，包含运行时监控器和最小限制的引导过滤器两个机制。

Result: 在多个LLM和毒性基准测试中，BRT-Align比基线方法更早更准确地检测不安全内容，显著减少不安全生成同时保持句子多样性和连贯性。

Conclusion: 可达性分析为推理时LLM安全提供了原则性和实用的基础，能够持续产生更少暴力、粗俗、冒犯和政治偏见的响应。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are now ubiquitous in everyday tools, raising
urgent safety concerns about their tendency to generate harmful content. The
dominant safety approach -- reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF)
-- effectively shapes model behavior during training but offers no safeguards
at inference time, where unsafe continuations may still arise. We propose
BRT-Align, a reachability-based framework that brings control-theoretic safety
tools to LLM inference. BRT-Align models autoregressive generation as a
dynamical system in latent space and learn a safety value function via backward
reachability, estimating the worst-case evolution of a trajectory. This enables
two complementary mechanisms: (1) a runtime monitor that forecasts unsafe
completions several tokens in advance, and (2) a least-restrictive steering
filter that minimally perturbs latent states to redirect generation away from
unsafe regions. Experiments across multiple LLMs and toxicity benchmarks
demonstrate that BRT-Align provides more accurate and earlier detection of
unsafe continuations than baselines. Moreover, for LLM safety alignment,
BRT-Align substantially reduces unsafe generations while preserving sentence
diversity and coherence. Qualitative results further highlight emergent
alignment properties: BRT-Align consistently produces responses that are less
violent, less profane, less offensive, and less politically biased. Together,
these findings demonstrate that reachability analysis provides a principled and
practical foundation for inference-time LLM safety.

Abstract: Data augmentation is a widely used strategy to improve model robustness and
generalization by enriching training datasets with synthetic examples. While
large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong generative capabilities
for this purpose, their applications in high-stakes domains like healthcare
present unique challenges due to the risk of generating clinically incorrect or
misleading information. In this work, we propose a novel query-based model
collaboration framework that integrates expert-level domain knowledge to guide
the augmentation process to preserve critical medical information. Experiments
on clinical prediction tasks demonstrate that our lightweight
collaboration-based approach consistently outperforms existing LLM augmentation
methods while improving safety through reduced factual errors. This framework
addresses the gap between LLM augmentation potential and the safety
requirements of specialized domains.

Motivation: 探究归纳头是否能够支持具有层次结构的复杂重复模式的上下文学习，因为自然语言中存在大量此类情况，如"the"后面跟随多个名词时需要整合更多上下文信息。

Method: 设计合成上下文学习任务，其中标记以层次依赖关系重复出现，评估各种LLMs在这些标记序列和自然语言类似情况上的表现。

Result: 发现自适应归纳头支持通过上下文学习来预测，学习过程由揭示潜在上下文的注意力头支持，这些上下文决定不同的标记转换关系。

Conclusion: 不仅证明LLMs具有学习的归纳头，还提供了LLMs如何在上下文中学习预测高阶重复模式的完整机制解释。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at in-context learning, the ability to use
information provided as context to improve prediction of future tokens.
Induction heads have been argued to play a crucial role for in-context learning
in Transformer Language Models. These attention heads make a token attend to
successors of past occurrences of the same token in the input. This basic
mechanism supports LLMs' ability to copy and predict repeating patterns.
However, it is unclear if this same mechanism can support in-context learning
of more complex repetitive patterns with hierarchical structure. Natural
language is teeming with such cases: The article "the" in English usually
prefaces multiple nouns in a text. When predicting which token succeeds a
particular instance of "the", we need to integrate further contextual cues from
the text to predict the correct noun. If induction heads naively attend to all
past instances of successor tokens of "the" in a context-independent manner,
they cannot support this level of contextual information integration. In this
study, we design a synthetic in-context learning task, where tokens are
repeated with hierarchical dependencies. Here, attending uniformly to all
successor tokens is not sufficient to accurately predict future tokens.
Evaluating a range of LLMs on these token sequences and natural language
analogues, we find adaptive induction heads that support prediction by learning
what to attend to in-context. Next, we investigate how induction heads
themselves learn in-context. We find evidence that learning is supported by
attention heads that uncover a set of latent contexts, determining the
different token transition relationships. Overall, we not only show that LLMs
have induction heads that learn, but offer a complete mechanistic account of
how LLMs learn to predict higher-order repetitive patterns in-context.

Method: 借鉴非人类动物元认知研究，采用行为实验范式测试模型能否策略性地运用内部状态知识，并分析token概率来验证内部信号的存在。

Result: 前沿LLM显示出某些元认知能力，包括评估回答事实和推理问题的置信度，以及预测和适当利用未来回答的能力。这些能力具有分辨率有限、情境依赖性，且与人类元认知存在质的不同。

Conclusion: LLM确实表现出元认知能力，但这些能力有限且与人类不同，模型的后训练可能在发展元认知能力中发挥作用。

Abstract: The possibility of LLM self-awareness and even sentience is gaining
increasing public attention and has major safety and policy implications, but
the science of measuring them is still in a nascent state. Here we introduce a
novel methodology for quantitatively evaluating metacognitive abilities in
LLMs. Taking inspiration from research on metacognition in nonhuman animals,
our approach eschews model self-reports and instead tests to what degree models
can strategically deploy knowledge of internal states. Using two experimental
paradigms, we demonstrate that frontier LLMs introduced since early 2024 show
increasingly strong evidence of certain metacognitive abilities, specifically
the ability to assess and utilize their own confidence in their ability to
answer factual and reasoning questions correctly and the ability to anticipate
what answers they would give and utilize that information appropriately. We
buttress these behavioral findings with an analysis of the token probabilities
returned by the models, which suggests the presence of an upstream internal
signal that could provide the basis for metacognition. We further find that
these abilities 1) are limited in resolution, 2) emerge in context-dependent
manners, and 3) seem to be qualitatively different from those of humans. We
also report intriguing differences across models of similar capabilities,
suggesting that LLM post-training may have a role in developing metacognitive
abilities.

Conclusion: 本书系统性地建立了在不确定性下进行机器学习选择的理论基础，为离线监督学习和在线学习提供了统一的统计工具框架，确保学习过程的结果具有理论可靠性。

Abstract: Learning, whether natural or artificial, is a process of selection. It starts
with a set of candidate options and selects the more successful ones. In the
case of machine learning the selection is done based on empirical estimates of
prediction accuracy of candidate prediction rules on some data. Due to
randomness of data sampling the empirical estimates are inherently noisy,
leading to selection under uncertainty. The book provides statistical tools to
obtain theoretical guarantees on the outcome of selection under uncertainty. We
start with concentration of measure inequalities, which are the main
statistical instrument for controlling how much an empirical estimate of
expectation of a function deviates from the true expectation. The book covers a
broad range of inequalities, including Markov's, Chebyshev's, Hoeffding's,
Bernstein's, Empirical Bernstein's, Unexpected Bernstein's, kl, and split-kl.
We then study the classical (offline) supervised learning and provide a range
of tools for deriving generalization bounds, including Occam's razor,
Vapnik-Chervonenkis analysis, and PAC-Bayesian analysis. The latter is further
applied to derive generalization guarantees for weighted majority votes. After
covering the offline setting, we turn our attention to online learning. We
present the space of online learning problems characterized by environmental
feedback, environmental resistance, and structural complexity. A common
performance measure in online learning is regret, which compares performance of
an algorithm to performance of the best prediction rule in hindsight, out of a
restricted set of prediction rules. We present tools for deriving regret bounds
in stochastic and adversarial environments, and under full information and
bandit feedback.

TL;DR: 提出Gumbel动力学模型(GDM)，通过引入离散状态的连续松弛和Gumbel分布的噪声模型，解决了传统切换动力系统在建模平滑过渡和随机混合状态时的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统切换动力系统由于离散状态的限制，难以捕捉平滑、变速的过渡以及随机混合的重叠状态，在真实数据中经常出现虚假的快速切换问题。

Method: 引入离散状态的连续松弛，在松弛离散状态空间上通过Gumbel分布定义不同的噪声模型，使模型完全可微分，支持标准梯度下降方法进行快速可扩展训练。

Result: 在标准仿真数据集上验证了模型能力，能够建模软粘性状态和随机环境中的过渡。在真实数据集上展示了在具有多个动力学的随机时间序列中推断可解释状态的能力。

Conclusion: GDM扩展了可用状态动力学的集合，能够更忠实地近似平滑和非平稳的真实动力学，在传统方法经常失败的随机时间序列多动力学设置中表现良好。

Abstract: Switching dynamical systems can model complicated time series data while
maintaining interpretability by inferring a finite set of dynamics primitives
and explaining different portions of the observed time series with one of these
primitives. However, due to the discrete nature of this set, such models
struggle to capture smooth, variable-speed transitions, as well as stochastic
mixtures of overlapping states, and the inferred dynamics often display
spurious rapid switching on real-world datasets. Here, we propose the Gumbel
Dynamical Model (GDM). First, by introducing a continuous relaxation of
discrete states and a different noise model defined on the relaxed-discrete
state space via the Gumbel distribution, GDM expands the set of available state
dynamics, allowing the model to approximate smoother and non-stationary
ground-truth dynamics more faithfully. Second, the relaxation makes the model
fully differentiable, enabling fast and scalable training with standard
gradient descent methods. We validate our approach on standard simulation
datasets and highlight its ability to model soft, sticky states and transitions
in a stochastic setting. Furthermore, we apply our model to two real-world
datasets, demonstrating its ability to infer interpretable states in stochastic
time series with multiple dynamics, a setting where traditional methods often
fail.

Abstract: Operator learning is a recently developed generalization of regression to
mappings between functions. It promises to drastically reduce expensive
numerical integration of PDEs to fast evaluations of mappings between
functional states of a system, i.e., surrogate and reduced-order modeling.
Operator learning has already found applications in several areas such as
modeling sea ice, combustion, and atmospheric physics. Recent approaches
towards integrating uncertainty quantification into the operator models have
relied on likelihood based methods to infer parameter distributions from noisy
data. However, stochastic operators may yield actions from which a likelihood
is difficult or impossible to construct. In this paper, we introduce, GenUQ, a
measure-theoretic approach to UQ that avoids constructing a likelihood by
introducing a generative hyper-network model that produces parameter
distributions consistent with observed data. We demonstrate that GenUQ
outperforms other UQ methods in three example problems, recovering a
manufactured operator, learning the solution operator to a stochastic elliptic
PDE, and modeling the failure location of porous steel under tension.

Abstract: Federated continual learning (FCL) enables distributed client devices to
learn from streaming data across diverse and evolving tasks. A major challenge
to continual learning, catastrophic forgetting, is exacerbated in decentralized
settings by the data heterogeneity, constrained communication and privacy
concerns. We propose Federated gradient Projection-based Continual Learning
with Task Identity Prediction (FedProTIP), a novel FCL framework that mitigates
forgetting by projecting client updates onto the orthogonal complement of the
subspace spanned by previously learned representations of the global model.
This projection reduces interference with earlier tasks and preserves
performance across the task sequence. To further address the challenge of
task-agnostic inference, we incorporate a lightweight mechanism that leverages
core bases from prior tasks to predict task identity and dynamically adjust the
global model's outputs. Extensive experiments across standard FCL benchmarks
demonstrate that FedProTIP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods
in average accuracy, particularly in settings where task identities are a
priori unknown.

Abstract: The study of causal abstractions bridges two integral components of human
intelligence: the ability to determine cause and effect, and the ability to
interpret complex patterns into abstract concepts. Formally, causal abstraction
frameworks define connections between complicated low-level causal models and
simple high-level ones. One major limitation of most existing definitions is
that they are not well-defined when considering lossy abstraction functions in
which multiple low-level interventions can have different effects while mapping
to the same high-level intervention (an assumption called the abstract
invariance condition). In this paper, we introduce a new type of abstractions
called projected abstractions that generalize existing definitions to
accommodate lossy representations. We show how to construct a projected
abstraction from the low-level model and how it translates equivalent
observational, interventional, and counterfactual causal queries from low to
high-level. Given that the true model is rarely available in practice we prove
a new graphical criteria for identifying and estimating high-level causal
queries from limited low-level data. Finally, we experimentally show the
effectiveness of projected abstraction models in high-dimensional image
settings.

TL;DR: LANCE提出了一种低秩激活压缩框架，通过一次性高阶SVD获得可重用的低秩子空间，减少激活存储和计算开销，支持设备端持续学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 设备端学习需要高效学习，但反向传播中激活存储的内存成本很高。现有压缩方法依赖重复低秩分解，存在计算开销，且未探索持续学习场景。

Method: 使用一次性高阶SVD获得可重用的低秩子空间进行激活投影，避免重复分解。固定低秩子空间通过分配任务到正交子空间实现持续学习。

Result: 在CIFAR-10/100等数据集上减少激活存储达250倍，保持与完整反向传播相当的精度。在持续学习基准测试中，以少量内存成本实现与正交梯度投影方法竞争的性能。

Conclusion: LANCE为边缘设备上的高效微调和持续学习提供了实用且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: On-device learning is essential for personalization, privacy, and long-term
adaptation in resource-constrained environments. Achieving this requires
efficient learning, both fine-tuning existing models and continually acquiring
new tasks without catastrophic forgetting. Yet both settings are constrained by
high memory cost of storing activations during backpropagation. Existing
activation compression methods reduce this cost but relying on repeated
low-rank decompositions, introducing computational overhead. Also, such methods
have not been explored for continual learning. We propose LANCE (Low-rank
Activation Compression), a framework that performs one-shot higher-order
Singular Value Decompsoition (SVD) to obtain a reusable low-rank subspace for
activation projection. This eliminates repeated decompositions, reducing both
memory and computation. Moreover, fixed low-rank subspaces further enable
on-device continual learning by allocating tasks to orthogonal subspaces
without storing large task-specific matrices. Experiments show that LANCE
reduces activation storage up to 250$\times$ while maintaining accuracy
comparable to full backpropagation on CIFAR-10/100, Oxford-IIIT Pets,
Flowers102, and CUB-200 datasets. On continual learning benchmarks (Split
CIFAR-100, Split MiniImageNet, 5-Datasets), it achieves performance competitive
with orthogonal gradient projection methods at a fraction of the memory cost.
These results position LANCE as a practical and scalable solution for efficient
fine-tuning and continual learning on edge devices.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型模型训练资源消耗巨大，且观察到大部分学习发生在训练早期阶段，后续权重变化趋于稳定，可用低秩矩阵捕获。

Method: 通过用户定义超参数确定切换点，根据各模块层的收敛程度分配特定秩，动态从全参数训练切换到LoRA。

Result: 模型精度保持，可训练参数减少到原来的10%，吞吐量提升3倍，每轮平均训练时间减少1.5倍，GPU内存消耗降低20%。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效减少训练资源消耗同时保持模型性能，为大型模型训练提供高效解决方案。

Abstract: Training large models ranging from millions to billions of parameters is
highly resource-intensive, requiring significant time, compute, and memory. It
is observed that most of the learning (higher change in weights) takes place in
the earlier stage of the training loop. These changes stabilize as training
continues, enabling them to be captured by matrices of a low intrinsic rank.
Therefore, we propose an approach to identify such states of partial
convergence and dynamically switch from full parameter training to Low-Rank
Adaptation (LoRA) on the ViT-Large model. We introduce a flexible approach that
leverages user-defined hyperparameters to determine the switching point and
assign a rank specific to each module layer based on its level of convergence.
Experimental results show that this approach preserves model accuracy while
reducing the number of trainable parameters to 10% of its original size,
resulting in a 3x improvement in throughput, and a 1.5x reduction in average
training time per epoch while also reducing GPU memory consumption by 20%

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种直接从深度学习模型预测分子Hessian矩阵的方法HIP，无需自动微分或有限差分，比传统方法快1-2个数量级，更准确且内存效率更高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分子Hessian矩阵在计算化学中至关重要，但计算成本高且随系统规模扩展性差，无论是量子力学方法还是神经网络都存在这一问题。

Method: 利用图神经网络消息传递中计算得到的不可约表示特征（最高l=2度）构建SE(3)-等变、对称的Hessian矩阵。

Result: HIP Hessians比传统方法快1-2个数量级，更准确，内存效率更高，训练更容易，系统规模扩展性更好。在过渡态搜索、几何优化加速、零点能校正和振动分析等任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: HIP方法能够直接高效预测Hessian矩阵，在多个下游任务中展现出卓越性能，为计算化学提供了新的高效工具。

Abstract: Fundamental tasks in computational chemistry, from transition state search to
vibrational analysis, rely on molecular Hessians, which are the second
derivatives of the potential energy. Yet, Hessians are computationally
expensive to calculate and scale poorly with system size, with both quantum
mechanical methods and neural networks. In this work, we demonstrate that
Hessians can be predicted directly from a deep learning model, without relying
on automatic differentiation or finite differences. We observe that one can
construct SE(3)-equivariant, symmetric Hessians from irreducible
representations (irrep) features up to degree $l$=2 computed during message
passing in graph neural networks. This makes HIP Hessians one to two orders of
magnitude faster, more accurate, more memory efficient, easier to train, and
enables more favorable scaling with system size. We validate our predictions
across a wide range of downstream tasks, demonstrating consistently superior
performance for transition state search, accelerated geometry optimization,
zero-point energy corrections, and vibrational analysis benchmarks. We
open-source the HIP codebase and model weights to enable further development of
the direct prediction of Hessians at https://github.com/BurgerAndreas/hip

*Feng Yu,Jia Hu,Geyong Min*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了BHRA方法，通过分块Hadamard调制解决LoRA在参数高效微调中的秩限制问题，在保持参数效率的同时实现局部秩放大。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LoRA方法受限于名义秩r，而HiRA等扩展方法虽然提高了名义秩，但将每个更新与冻结权重矩阵的全局能量模式耦合，限制了灵活性。

Method: BHRA将每个权重矩阵分区，在每个块内独立应用HiRA风格的乘法调制，保持PEFT参数足迹的同时实现局部秩放大。

Result: 在8个常识推理任务和2个算术基准测试中，使用Llama-3.2 1B/3B、Mistral-7B和Gemma-2 9B模型，BHRA在相同参数预算下始终优于强PEFT基线。

Conclusion: 块状设计在保持丰富频谱的同时缓解了全局调制引起的崩溃，为参数高效微调提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods must be resource-efficient yet
handle heterogeneous reasoning transformations, and classical low-rank
adaptation (LoRA) is constrained by the nominal rank $r$. Hadamard-style
extensions like HiRA raise the nominal rank but couple every update to the
global energy pattern of the frozen weight matrix, while ABBA trades this
inductive bias for fully learned dense intermediates. To address the limitation
of global modulation, we propose Block Hadamard high-Rank Adaptation (BHRA),
which partitions each weight matrix and applies HiRA-style multiplicative
modulation independently within every block, preserving the PEFT parameter
footprint while unlocking localized rank amplification. Our empirical analyses
reveal that this blockwise design maintains rich spectra across rank budgets,
mitigating the collapse induced by global modulation. Across eight commonsense
reasoning tasks and two arithmetic benchmarks with Llama-3.2 1B/3B, Mistral-7B,
and Gemma-2 9B, BHRA consistently surpasses strong PEFT baselines under matched
parameter budgets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文通过高维最小范数线性回归理论框架分析掩码预训练，提出了一种简单有效的随机随机掩码自编码(R²MAE)方法，在多个领域优于传统掩码方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管掩码预训练在语言、视觉和生物学领域取得了经验性成功，但其在数据表示学习中的作用和限制仍不清楚。研究旨在从理论角度理解掩码预训练的行为机制。

Method: 使用高维最小范数线性回归理论框架分析掩码预训练，无需依赖额外模型规范。基于理论分析提出了R²MAE预训练方案，强制模型捕获数据的多尺度特征。

Result: 理论框架在多种神经网络架构上得到验证。R²MAE在视觉、语言、DNA序列和单细胞模型中均优于标准和更复杂的掩码方案，提升了最先进模型的性能。

Conclusion: 掩码预训练行为可以通过线性回归理论直接表征，R²MAE作为一种简单但被忽视的预训练方案，能够有效提升模型性能，证明了理论指导实践的价值。

Abstract: Mask-based pretraining has become a cornerstone of modern large-scale models
across language, vision, and recently biology. Despite its empirical success,
its role and limits in learning data representations have been unclear. In this
work, we show that the behavior of mask-based pretraining can be directly
characterized by test risk in high-dimensional minimum-norm ("ridge-less")
linear regression, without relying on further model specifications. Further
analysis of linear models uncovers several novel aspects of mask-based
pretraining. The theoretical framework and its implications have been validated
across diverse neural architectures (including MLPs, CNNs, and Transformers)
applied to both vision and language tasks. Guided by our theory, we propose an
embarrassingly simple yet overlooked pretraining scheme named Randomly Random
Mask AutoEncoding (R$^2$MAE), which enforces capturing multi-scale features
from data and is able to outperform optimal fixed mask ratio settings in our
linear model framework. We implement R$^2$MAE in vision, language, DNA
sequence, and single-cell models, where it consistently outperforms standard
and more complicated masking schemes, leading to improvements for
state-of-the-art models. Our code is available at:

TL;DR: 该论文提出了安全、信任和AGI的严格数学定义，并证明这三者之间存在根本的不兼容性：一个安全且可信的AI系统不可能是AGI系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为人工智能系统中的安全、信任和通用人工智能等模糊概念提供严格的数学定义，并探索它们之间的基本关系。

Method: 通过数学定义和形式化证明，在程序验证、规划和图可达性等具体问题上展示安全、信任与AGI之间的不兼容性。

Result: 证明对于严格定义的安全和可信AI系统，存在人类可以轻松解决但系统无法解决的任务实例，因此这样的系统不可能是AGI。

Conclusion: 安全、信任和AGI在严格数学定义下存在根本的不兼容性，这类似于哥德尔不完备定理和图灵停机问题不可判定性的解释。

Abstract: Safety, trust and Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) are aspirational
goals in artificial intelligence (AI) systems, and there are several informal
interpretations of these notions. In this paper, we propose strict,
mathematical definitions of safety, trust, and AGI, and demonstrate a
fundamental incompatibility between them. We define safety of a system as the
property that it never makes any false claims, trust as the assumption that the
system is safe, and AGI as the property of an AI system always matching or
exceeding human capability. Our core finding is that -- for our formal
definitions of these notions -- a safe and trusted AI system cannot be an AGI
system: for such a safe, trusted system there are task instances which are
easily and provably solvable by a human but not by the system. We note that we
consider strict mathematical definitions of safety and trust, and it is
possible for real-world deployments to instead rely on alternate, practical
interpretations of these notions. We show our results for program verification,
planning, and graph reachability. Our proofs draw parallels to G\"odel's
incompleteness theorems and Turing's proof of the undecidability of the halting
problem, and can be regarded as interpretations of G\"odel's and Turing's
results.

TL;DR: DriftLite是一种轻量级、无需训练的粒子方法，用于扩散模型的推理时自适应，通过最优稳定性控制改进样本质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于引导的方法会引入偏差，而基于粒子的校正方法存在权重退化和高计算成本问题，需要一种更优的推理时自适应方法

Method: 利用Fokker-Planck方程中漂移和粒子势能之间未被探索的自由度，开发了Variance-和Energy-Controlling Guidance (VCG/ECG)来近似最优漂移

Result: 在混合高斯模型、粒子系统和大规模蛋白质-配体共折叠问题中，DriftLite始终减少方差并提高样本质量

Conclusion: DriftLite为扩散模型的推理时自适应提供了一条原理性、高效的路径

Abstract: We study inference-time scaling for diffusion models, where the goal is to
adapt a pre-trained model to new target distributions without retraining.
Existing guidance-based methods are simple but introduce bias, while
particle-based corrections suffer from weight degeneracy and high computational
cost. We introduce DriftLite, a lightweight, training-free particle-based
approach that steers the inference dynamics on the fly with provably optimal
stability control. DriftLite exploits a previously unexplored degree of freedom
in the Fokker-Planck equation between the drift and particle potential, and
yields two practical instantiations: Variance- and Energy-Controlling Guidance
(VCG/ECG) for approximating the optimal drift with minimal overhead. Across
Gaussian mixture models, particle systems, and large-scale protein-ligand
co-folding problems, DriftLite consistently reduces variance and improves
sample quality over pure guidance and sequential Monte Carlo baselines. These
results highlight a principled, efficient route toward scalable inference-time
adaptation of diffusion models.

### [246] [Differentiable Structure Learning for General Binary Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21658)
*Chang Deng,Bryon Aragam*

TL;DR: 提出了一种可微分结构学习框架，能够捕捉离散变量间的任意依赖关系，避免了现有方法对特定结构方程模型的假设限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常假设数据来自特定结构方程模型，这可能与真实数据生成过程不符，且忽略了离散数据中的复杂依赖结构，只考虑线性效应。

Method: 将学习问题表述为最一般形式的单次可微分优化任务，避免先前方法采用的不现实简化，能够表征兼容参数和结构的完整集合。

Result: 经验结果表明，该方法能有效捕捉离散数据中的复杂关系，并在温和假设下建立了马尔可夫等价类的可识别性。

Conclusion: 虽然一般离散模型从纯观测数据中不可识别，但可以表征兼容参数和结构的完整集合，提出的框架在离散数据中有效捕捉复杂依赖关系。

Abstract: Existing methods for differentiable structure learning in discrete data
typically assume that the data are generated from specific structural equation
models. However, these assumptions may not align with the true data-generating
process, which limits the general applicability of such methods. Furthermore,
current approaches often ignore the complex dependence structure inherent in
discrete data and consider only linear effects. We propose a differentiable
structure learning framework that is capable of capturing arbitrary
dependencies among discrete variables. We show that although general discrete
models are unidentifiable from purely observational data, it is possible to
characterize the complete set of compatible parameters and structures.
Additionally, we establish identifiability up to Markov equivalence under mild
assumptions. We formulate the learning problem as a single differentiable
optimization task in the most general form, thereby avoiding the unrealistic
simplifications adopted by previous methods. Empirical results demonstrate that
our approach effectively captures complex relationships in discrete data.

Conclusion: 该框架可直接应用于各种PDE控制的反问题，为这类问题提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Partial differential equation (PDE)-governed inverse problems are fundamental
across various scientific and engineering applications; yet they face
significant challenges due to nonlinearity, ill-posedness, and sensitivity to
noise. Here, we introduce a new computational framework, RED-DiffEq, by
integrating physics-driven inversion and data-driven learning. RED-DiffEq
leverages pretrained diffusion models as a regularization mechanism for
PDE-governed inverse problems. We apply RED-DiffEq to solve the full waveform
inversion problem in geophysics, a challenging seismic imaging technique that
seeks to reconstruct high-resolution subsurface velocity models from seismic
measurement data. Our method shows enhanced accuracy and robustness compared to
conventional methods. Additionally, it exhibits strong generalization ability
to more complex velocity models that the diffusion model is not trained on. Our
framework can also be directly applied to diverse PDE-governed inverse
problems.

Abstract: Treatment effect estimation is essential for informed decision-making in many
fields such as healthcare, economics, and public policy. While flexible machine
learning models have been widely applied for estimating heterogeneous treatment
effects, quantifying the inherent uncertainty of their point predictions
remains an issue. Recent advancements in conformal prediction address this
limitation by allowing for inexpensive computation, as well as distribution
shifts, while still providing frequentist, finite-sample coverage guarantees
under minimal assumptions for any point-predictor model. This advancement holds
significant potential for improving decision-making in especially high-stakes
environments. In this work, we perform a systematic review regarding conformal
prediction methods for treatment effect estimation and provide for both the
necessary theoretical background. Through a systematic filtering process, we
select and analyze eleven key papers, identifying and describing current
state-of-the-art methods in this area. Based on our findings, we propose
directions for future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要利用大语言模型改进文本步骤，但视觉对象状态对齐和系统评估研究不足，需要解决跨模态对象状态一致性问题

Result: 在RECIPEPLAN和WIKIPLAN数据集上，MMPlanner在文本规划上提升+6.8%，跨模态对齐提升+11.9%，视觉步骤排序提升+26.7%

Conclusion: MMPlanner通过显式建模对象状态转换和系统性评估方法，在多模态程序规划任务中取得了显著改进，证明了对象状态推理的重要性

Abstract: Multimodal Procedural Planning (MPP) aims to generate step-by-step
instructions that combine text and images, with the central challenge of
preserving object-state consistency across modalities while producing
informative plans. Existing approaches often leverage large language models
(LLMs) to refine textual steps; however, visual object-state alignment and
systematic evaluation are largely underexplored. We present MMPlanner, a
zero-shot MPP framework that introduces Object State Reasoning Chain-of-Thought
(OSR-CoT) prompting to explicitly model object-state transitions and generate
accurate multimodal plans. To assess plan quality, we design LLM-as-a-judge
protocols for planning accuracy and cross-modal alignment, and further propose
a visual step-reordering task to measure temporal coherence. Experiments on
RECIPEPLAN and WIKIPLAN show that MMPlanner achieves state-of-the-art
performance, improving textual planning by +6.8%, cross-modal alignment by
+11.9%, and visual step ordering by +26.7%

Motivation: 神经符号集成领域分为手工规则注入和数据驱动规则学习两种方法，需要统一框架来灵活整合数据驱动的规则学习和符号先验知识。

Method: 扩展命题逻辑语法，引入具有可学习参数的选择操作符，使用模糊逻辑将公式编译为可微分计算图，通过反向传播学习最优选择。

Result: 在表格数据和Visual Tic-Tac-Toe神经符号任务上取得强结果，同时产生可解释的决策规则。

Conclusion: LoH框架统一了现有神经符号模型，支持任意程度的知识规范，使用Goedel模糊逻辑和Goedel技巧实现无性能损失的离散化。

Abstract: Neurosymbolic integration (NeSy) blends neural-network learning with symbolic
reasoning. The field can be split between methods injecting hand-crafted rules
into neural models, and methods inducing symbolic rules from data. We introduce
Logic of Hypotheses (LoH), a novel language that unifies these strands,
enabling the flexible integration of data-driven rule learning with symbolic
priors and expert knowledge. LoH extends propositional logic syntax with a
choice operator, which has learnable parameters and selects a subformula from a
pool of options. Using fuzzy logic, formulas in LoH can be directly compiled
into a differentiable computational graph, so the optimal choices can be
learned via backpropagation. This framework subsumes some existing NeSy models,
while adding the possibility of arbitrary degrees of knowledge specification.
Moreover, the use of Goedel fuzzy logic and the recently developed Goedel trick
yields models that can be discretized to hard Boolean-valued functions without
any loss in performance. We provide experimental analysis on such models,
showing strong results on tabular data and on the Visual Tic-Tac-Toe NeSy task,
while producing interpretable decision rules.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型由于其复杂结构和大量参数容易过拟合，会记忆训练数据中的噪声而非学习泛化模式

Method: 通过惩罚相对于线性基线的单调性违规来强制实施单调性，建立线性参考、测量单调行为偏差，并将这些测量整合到训练目标中

Result: 在芝加哥网约车数据集和合成数据集上的实验表明，即使适度的单调性约束也能持续提升模型性能

Conclusion: DIM通过应用领域知识的单调性约束来正则化模型行为，提高了深度神经网络的预测性能

Abstract: While deep learning models excel at predictive tasks, they often overfit due
to their complex structure and large number of parameters, causing them to
memorize training data, including noise, rather than learn patterns that
generalize to new data. To tackle this challenge, this paper proposes a new
regularization method, i.e., Enforcing Domain-Informed Monotonicity in Deep
Neural Networks (DIM), which maintains domain-informed monotonic relationships
in complex deep learning models to further improve predictions. Specifically,
our method enforces monotonicity by penalizing violations relative to a linear
baseline, effectively encouraging the model to follow expected trends while
preserving its predictive power. We formalize this approach through a
comprehensive mathematical framework that establishes a linear reference,
measures deviations from monotonic behavior, and integrates these measurements
into the training objective. We test and validate the proposed methodology
using a real-world ridesourcing dataset from Chicago and a synthetically
created dataset. Experiments across various neural network architectures show
that even modest monotonicity constraints consistently enhance model
performance. DIM enhances the predictive performance of deep neural networks by
applying domain-informed monotonicity constraints to regularize model behavior
and mitigate overfitting

Abstract: High-resolution neural datasets enable foundation models for the next
generation of brain-computer interfaces and neurological treatments. The
community requires rigorous benchmarks to discriminate between competing
modeling approaches, yet no standardized evaluation frameworks exist for
intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings. To address this gap, we present Neuroprobe:
a suite of decoding tasks for studying multi-modal language processing in the
brain. Unlike scalp EEG, intracranial EEG requires invasive surgery to implant
electrodes that record neural activity directly from the brain with minimal
signal distortion. Neuroprobe is built on the BrainTreebank dataset, which
consists of 40 hours of iEEG recordings from 10 human subjects performing a
naturalistic movie viewing task. Neuroprobe serves two critical functions.
First, it is a mine from which neuroscience insights can be drawn. Its high
temporal and spatial resolution allows researchers to systematically determine
when and where computations for each aspect of language processing occur in the
brain by measuring the decodability of each feature across time and all
electrode locations. Using Neuroprobe, we visualize how information flows from
the superior temporal gyrus to the prefrontal cortex, and the progression from
simple auditory features to more complex language features in a purely
data-driven manner. Second, as the field moves toward neural foundation models,
Neuroprobe provides a rigorous framework for comparing competing architectures
and training protocols. We found that the linear baseline is surprisingly
strong, beating frontier foundation models on many tasks. Neuroprobe is
designed with computational efficiency and ease of use in mind. We make the
code for Neuroprobe openly available and maintain a public leaderboard, aiming
to enable rapid progress in the field of iEEG foundation models, at
https://neuroprobe.dev/

Motivation: 现有基础模型主要关注日常活动分类，限制了其在更广泛任务中的应用，需要开发能泛化到多样化下游任务的加速度计基础模型。

Method: 使用时频槽注意力机制处理原始信号的时频表示，生成多个小嵌入捕捉不同信号组件，并引入两个损失正则化器来捕获局部结构和频率模式。

Result: 在16个分类和回归下游任务中，SlotFM在13个任务上优于现有自监督方法，其余任务达到可比性能，平均性能提升4.5%。

Conclusion: SlotFM展示了感知基础模型的强大泛化能力，能够有效处理超出标准人类活动识别的多样化任务。

Abstract: Wearable accelerometers are used for a wide range of applications, such as
gesture recognition, gait analysis, and sports monitoring. Yet most existing
foundation models focus primarily on classifying common daily activities such
as locomotion and exercise, limiting their applicability to the broader range
of tasks that rely on other signal characteristics. We present SlotFM, an
accelerometer foundation model that generalizes across diverse downstream
tasks. SlotFM uses Time-Frequency Slot Attention, an extension of Slot
Attention that processes both time and frequency representations of the raw
signals. It generates multiple small embeddings (slots), each capturing
different signal components, enabling task-specific heads to focus on the most
relevant parts of the data. We also introduce two loss regularizers that
capture local structure and frequency patterns, which improve reconstruction of
fine-grained details and helps the embeddings preserve task-relevant
information. We evaluate SlotFM on 16 classification and regression downstream
tasks that extend beyond standard human activity recognition. It outperforms
existing self-supervised approaches on 13 of these tasks and achieves
comparable results to the best performing approaches on the remaining tasks. On
average, our method yields a 4.5% performance gain, demonstrating strong
generalization for sensing foundation models.

Motivation: K-means聚类是一个困难的离散优化问题，现有的非凸方法在平衡约束可行性和目标最优性方面存在困难，难以计算具有严格保证的二阶临界点。

Method: 将K-means问题重新表述为子流形上的光滑无约束优化，利用黎曼几何结构，采用二阶立方正则化黎曼牛顿算法，通过将K-means流形分解为乘积流形，使每个牛顿子问题能在线性时间内求解。

Conclusion: 提出的黎曼优化框架为K-means聚类提供了高效且理论保证的求解方法，在收敛速度和统计精度方面都表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Clustering is a hard discrete optimization problem. Nonconvex approaches such
as low-rank semidefinite programming (SDP) have recently demonstrated promising
statistical and local algorithmic guarantees for cluster recovery. Due to the
combinatorial structure of the $K$-means clustering problem, current relaxation
algorithms struggle to balance their constraint feasibility and objective
optimality, presenting tremendous challenges in computing the second-order
critical points with rigorous guarantees. In this paper, we provide a new
formulation of the $K$-means problem as a smooth unconstrained optimization
over a submanifold and characterize its Riemannian structures to allow it to be
solved using a second-order cubic-regularized Riemannian Newton algorithm. By
factorizing the $K$-means manifold into a product manifold, we show how each
Newton subproblem can be solved in linear time. Our numerical experiments show
that the proposed method converges significantly faster than the
state-of-the-art first-order nonnegative low-rank factorization method, while
achieving similarly optimal statistical accuracy.

significant part of the logic of feed-forward networks is captured in the
activation status of the neurons at inner layers. Prophecy works by extracting
rules based on neuron activations (values or on/off statuses) as preconditions
that imply certain desirable output property, e.g., the prediction being a
certain class. These rules represent network properties captured in the hidden
layers that imply the desired output behavior. We present the architecture of
the tool, highlight its features and demonstrate its usage on different types
of models and output properties. We present an overview of its applications,
such as inferring and proving formal explanations of neural networks,
compositional verification, run-time monitoring, repair, and others. We also
show novel results highlighting its potential in the era of large
vision-language models.

*Thomas Walton,Darin Tsui,Aryan Musharaf,Amirali Aghazadeh*

TL;DR: SpecMER是一种通过k-mer指导的推测解码框架，在蛋白质序列生成中结合生物结构功能先验，显著提升序列合理性同时保持解码效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归模型在蛋白质工程中生成新序列时存在延迟问题，且传统推测解码中的草稿模型忽略蛋白质结构功能约束，导致生物不可信输出和似然分布偏移。

Method: 使用从多序列比对中提取的k-mer基序，通过并行评分候选序列并选择最符合已知生物模式的序列，将生物结构功能先验整合到推测解码中。

Result: SpecMER相比标准自回归解码实现24-32%的加速，同时具有更高的接受率和改进的序列似然。

Conclusion: SpecMER框架成功解决了蛋白质序列生成中的延迟和生物合理性平衡问题，为高通量蛋白质筛选提供了高效可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Autoregressive models have transformed protein engineering by enabling the
generation of novel protein sequences beyond those found in nature. However,
their sequential inference introduces significant latency, limiting their
utility in high-throughput protein screening. Speculative decoding accelerates
generation by employing a lightweight draft model to sample tokens, which a
larger target model then verifies and refines. Yet, in protein sequence
generation, draft models are typically agnostic to the structural and
functional constraints of the target protein, leading to biologically
implausible outputs and a shift in the likelihood distribution of generated
sequences. We introduce SpecMER (Speculative Decoding via k-mer Guidance), a
novel framework that incorporates biological, structural, and functional priors
using k-mer motifs extracted from multiple sequence alignments. By scoring
candidate sequences in parallel and selecting those most consistent with known
biological patterns, SpecMER significantly improves sequence plausibility while
retaining the efficiency of speculative decoding. SpecMER achieves 24-32%
speedup over standard autoregressive decoding, along with higher acceptance
rates and improved sequence likelihoods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 真实世界视觉环境中难以获得精确的位置信息，传统基于目标位置距离的奖励设计方法在视觉强化学习中存在局限性。

Method: 使用关键点提取空间距离信息，构建预测模型作为规划器提出中间子目标，在分层强化学习框架下训练目标条件策略。

Result: 在复杂长视野操作任务中，ReLAM显著加速学习过程并达到优于现有方法的性能。

Conclusion: ReLAM通过自动生成结构化奖励有效解决了视觉强化学习中的奖励设计问题，为机器人操作任务提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Reward design remains a critical bottleneck in visual reinforcement learning
(RL) for robotic manipulation. In simulated environments, rewards are
conventionally designed based on the distance to a target position. However,
such precise positional information is often unavailable in real-world visual
settings due to sensory and perceptual limitations. In this study, we propose a
method that implicitly infers spatial distances through keypoints extracted
from images. Building on this, we introduce Reward Learning with Anticipation
Model (ReLAM), a novel framework that automatically generates dense, structured
rewards from action-free video demonstrations. ReLAM first learns an
anticipation model that serves as a planner and proposes intermediate
keypoint-based subgoals on the optimal path to the final goal, creating a
structured learning curriculum directly aligned with the task's geometric
objectives. Based on the anticipated subgoals, a continuous reward signal is
provided to train a low-level, goal-conditioned policy under the hierarchical
reinforcement learning (HRL) framework with provable sub-optimality bound.
Extensive experiments on complex, long-horizon manipulation tasks show that
ReLAM significantly accelerates learning and achieves superior performance
compared to state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: 本文提出三种正交改进方法，通过使用最小辅助信息来提升仅基于PPG的心脏骤停预测系统性能，包括时间到事件建模、患者身份不变性学习和伪标签回归。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的PPG基础模型虽然能预测心脏骤停等关键事件，但其强大表示能力在数据/标签稀缺的下游任务中未能充分利用，需要更有效的利用方式。

Method: 1. 时间到事件建模（回归事件发生时间或细粒度离散生存分析）；2. 通过对抗训练使模型学习心脏骤停聚焦特征，实现患者身份不变性；3. 使用预训练辅助估计器网络生成伪标签值进行回归。

Result: 提出的方法独立地将24小时时间平均AUC从0.74提升到0.78-0.80范围，在较长时域内显著改善，仅在事件临近时有轻微性能下降。

Conclusion: 这些改进推动了早期预警系统研究，并通过PCGrad优化技术缓解多任务学习中高梯度冲突率的问题。

Abstract: High-frequency physiological waveform modality offers deep, real-time
insights into patient status. Recently, physiological foundation models based
on Photoplethysmography (PPG), such as PPG-GPT, have been shown to predict
critical events, including Cardiac Arrest (CA). However, their powerful
representation still needs to be leveraged suitably, especially when the
downstream data/label is scarce. We offer three orthogonal improvements to
improve PPG-only CA systems by using minimal auxiliary information. First, we
propose to use time-to-event modeling, either through simple regression to the
event onset time or by pursuing fine-grained discrete survival modeling.
Second, we encourage the model to learn CA-focused features by making them
patient-identity invariant. This is achieved by first training the
largest-scale de-identified biometric identification model, referred to as the
p-vector, and subsequently using it adversarially to deconfound cues, such as
person identity, that may cause overfitting through memorization. Third, we
propose regression on the pseudo-lab values generated by pre-trained auxiliary
estimator networks. This is crucial since true blood lab measurements, such as
lactate, sodium, troponin, and potassium, are collected sparingly. Via
zero-shot prediction, the auxiliary networks can enrich cardiac arrest waveform
labels and generate pseudo-continuous estimates as targets. Our proposals can
independently improve the 24-hour time-averaged AUC from the 0.74 to the
0.78-0.80 range. We primarily improve over longer time horizons with minimal
degradation near the event, thus pushing the Early Warning System research.
Finally, we pursue multi-task formulation and diagnose it with a high gradient
conflict rate among competing losses, which we alleviate via the PCGrad
optimization technique.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在图级预测任务中，子图信息至关重要，但构建兼具高判别性和可解释性的模型仍具挑战性

Method: 结合精确子图枚举、神经网络和稀疏正则化，通过剪枝策略降低计算复杂度，同时识别重要子图

Result: EIN相比标准图神经网络具有足够高的预测性能，并能通过选择的重要子图进行后验分析

Conclusion: EIN在保持高预测性能的同时，通过子图选择提供了良好的可解释性

Abstract: In the graph-level prediction task (predict a label for a given graph), the
information contained in subgraphs of the input graph plays a key role. In this
paper, we propose Exact subgraph Isomorphism Network (EIN), which combines the
exact subgraph enumeration, neural network, and a sparse regularization. In
general, building a graph-level prediction model achieving high discriminative
ability along with interpretability is still a challenging problem. Our
combination of the subgraph enumeration and neural network contributes to high
discriminative ability about the subgraph structure of the input graph.
Further, the sparse regularization in EIN enables us 1) to derive an effective
pruning strategy that mitigates computational difficulty of the enumeration
while maintaining the prediction performance, and 2) to identify important
subgraphs that contributes to high interpretability. We empirically show that
EIN has sufficiently high prediction performance compared with standard graph
neural network models, and also, we show examples of post-hoc analysis based on
the selected subgraphs.

Method: 使用线性回归、随机森林、支持向量机和神经网络四种模型分析OD出行与人口统计、社会经济和通勤特征的相关性，并进行基于扰动的敏感性分析。

Result: 线性回归无法捕捉复杂变量交互，神经网络在训练和测试数据集上表现最佳，但支持向量机在降尺度性能上具有最佳泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法为改进交通服务和城市发展提供了分析进步和实际应用。

Abstract: Understanding urban human mobility patterns at various spatial levels is
essential for social science. This study presents a machine learning framework
to downscale origin-destination (OD) taxi trips flows in New York City from a
larger spatial unit to a smaller spatial unit. First, correlations between OD
trips and demographic, socioeconomic, and commuting characteristics are
developed using four models: Linear Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF),
Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Neural Networks (NN). Second, a
perturbation-based sensitivity analysis is applied to interpret variable
importance for nonlinear models. The results show that the linear regression
model failed to capture the complex variable interactions. While NN performs
best with the training and testing datasets, SVM shows the best generalization
ability in downscaling performance. The methodology presented in this study
provides both analytical advancement and practical applications to improve
transportation services and urban development.

Motivation: 联邦学习中数据异构性挑战全局模型性能，传统方法依赖全局训练后本地适应，需要更早阶段的质量控制方法。

Method: 从客户原始数据提取代表性特征，应用聚类技术估计客户间数据集相似度，基于相似度实施客户选择策略，让客户与数据分布兼容的其他客户协作。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和MNIST数据集上，与三种现有联邦学习算法集成，PQFed持续提升目标客户模型性能，即使在参与者有限的情况下也表现良好。

Conclusion: PQFed在个性化联邦学习设置中具有可扩展性和有效性，特别是在低参与度场景下优于基准聚类算法IFCA。

Abstract: Federated learning enables collaborative model training without sharing raw
data, but data heterogeneity consistently challenges the performance of the
global model. Traditional optimization methods often rely on collaborative
global model training involving all clients, followed by local adaptation to
improve individual performance. In this work, we focus on early-stage quality
control and propose PQFed, a novel privacy-preserving personalized federated
learning framework that designs customized training strategies for each client
prior to the federated training process. PQFed extracts representative features
from each client's raw data and applies clustering techniques to estimate
inter-client dataset similarity. Based on these similarity estimates, the
framework implements a client selection strategy that enables each client to
collaborate with others who have compatible data distributions. We evaluate
PQFed on two benchmark datasets, CIFAR-10 and MNIST, integrated with three
existing federated learning algorithms. Experimental results show that PQFed
consistently improves the target client's model performance, even with a
limited number of participants. We further benchmark PQFed against a baseline
cluster-based algorithm, IFCA, and observe that PQFed also achieves better
performance in low-participation scenarios. These findings highlight PQFed's
scalability and effectiveness in personalized federated learning settings.

Conclusion: 该框架为并行化序列模型提供了更清晰的理论基础，并指出了高效可扩展计算的新机会。

Abstract: Harnessing parallelism in seemingly sequential models is a central challenge
for modern machine learning. Several approaches have been proposed for
evaluating sequential processes in parallel using fixed-point methods, like
Newton, Picard, and Jacobi iterations. In this work, we show that these methods
can be understood within a common framework based on linear dynamical systems
(LDSs), where different iteration schemes arise naturally as approximate
linearizations of a nonlinear recursion. This unifying view highlights shared
principles behind these techniques and clarifies when particular fixed-point
methods are most likely to be effective. By bridging diverse algorithms through
the language of LDSs, our framework provides a clearer theoretical foundation
for parallelizing sequential models and points toward new opportunities for
efficient and scalable computation.

Result: 在多个基准数据集上实证证明了所提方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 信息论方法能够有效处理双层贝叶斯优化问题，通过统一标准同时优化两个层级，并在实验中表现出良好性能。

Abstract: A bilevel optimization problem consists of two optimization problems nested
as an upper- and a lower-level problem, in which the optimality of the
lower-level problem defines a constraint for the upper-level problem. This
paper considers Bayesian optimization (BO) for the case that both the upper-
and lower-levels involve expensive black-box functions. Because of its nested
structure, bilevel optimization has a complex problem definition and, compared
with other standard extensions of BO such as multi-objective or constraint
settings, it has not been widely studied. We propose an information-theoretic
approach that considers the information gain of both the upper- and
lower-optimal solutions and values. This enables us to define a unified
criterion that measures the benefit for both level problems, simultaneously.
Further, we also show a practical lower bound based approach to evaluating the
information gain. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed
method through several benchmark datasets.

Method: 开发可解释的时空图神经网络框架，利用双随机微分方程建模不规则采样的纵向fMRI数据，学习稀疏的区域和连接重要性概率。

Result: 在两个独立队列（OASIS-3和ADNI）上验证有效，识别出海马旁回皮层、前额叶皮层和顶叶小叶等关键区域，以及腹侧注意、背侧注意和默认模式网络的显著破坏，这些异常与纵向AD相关临床症状密切相关。

Conclusion: 该框架揭示了已确立和新的神经系统水平和性别特异性生物标志物，为AD进展的神经生物学机制提供了新见解，突显了基于时空图的学习在早期个体化预测AD进展方面的潜力。

Abstract: Identifying objective neuroimaging biomarkers to forecast Alzheimer's disease
(AD) progression is crucial for timely intervention. However, this task remains
challenging due to the complex dysfunctions in the spatio-temporal
characteristics of underlying brain networks, which are often overlooked by
existing methods. To address these limitations, we develop an interpretable
spatio-temporal graph neural network framework to predict future AD
progression, leveraging dual Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs) to model
the irregularly-sampled longitudinal functional magnetic resonance imaging
(fMRI) data. We validate our approach on two independent cohorts, including the
Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS-3) and the Alzheimer's Disease
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Our framework effectively learns sparse
regional and connective importance probabilities, enabling the identification
of key brain circuit abnormalities associated with disease progression.
Notably, we detect the parahippocampal cortex, prefrontal cortex, and parietal
lobule as salient regions, with significant disruptions in the ventral
attention, dorsal attention, and default mode networks. These abnormalities
correlate strongly with longitudinal AD-related clinical symptoms. Moreover,
our interpretability strategy reveals both established and novel neural
systems-level and sex-specific biomarkers, offering new insights into the
neurobiological mechanisms underlying AD progression. Our findings highlight
the potential of spatio-temporal graph-based learning for early, individualized
prediction of AD progression, even in the context of irregularly-sampled
longitudinal imaging data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统药物先导化合物优化方法样本效率低，现有LLM方法未能充分利用迭代优化过程的优势，需要一种能够从完整优化轨迹中学习的方法。

Method: 提出POLO框架，核心是偏好引导策略优化(PGPO)算法，包含轨迹级优化和轮次级偏好学习两个互补层次，从中间评估中提取学习信号。

Result: POLO在单属性任务上达到84%的平均成功率(比基线高2.3倍)，在多属性任务上达到50%成功率，仅使用500次oracle评估。

Conclusion: POLO通过充分利用每次昂贵的oracle调用，在样本高效的分子优化方面显著推进了最先进水平。

Abstract: Lead optimization in drug discovery requires efficiently navigating vast
chemical space through iterative cycles to enhance molecular properties while
preserving structural similarity to the original lead compound. Despite recent
advances, traditional optimization methods struggle with sample
efficiency-achieving good optimization performance with limited oracle
evaluations. Large Language Models (LLMs) provide a promising approach through
their in-context learning and instruction following capabilities, which align
naturally with these iterative processes. However, existing LLM-based methods
fail to leverage this strength, treating each optimization step independently.
To address this, we present POLO (Preference-guided multi-turn Optimization for
Lead Optimization), which enables LLMs to learn from complete optimization
trajectories rather than isolated steps. At its core, POLO introduces
Preference-Guided Policy Optimization (PGPO), a novel reinforcement learning
algorithm that extracts learning signals at two complementary levels:
trajectory-level optimization reinforces successful strategies, while
turn-level preference learning provides dense comparative feedback by ranking
intermediate molecules within each trajectory. Through this dual-level learning
from intermediate evaluation, POLO achieves superior sample efficiency by fully
exploiting each costly oracle call. Extensive experiments demonstrate that POLO
achieves 84% average success rate on single-property tasks (2.3x better than
baselines) and 50% on multi-property tasks using only 500 oracle evaluations,
significantly advancing the state-of-the-art in sample-efficient molecular
optimization.

Result: 在四个基准数据集上的实验表明，BrainPoG在各种脑疾病检测任务中在模型性能和计算效率方面均表现出优越性

Conclusion: BrainPoG能够专门学习信息丰富的疾病相关知识，同时避免不相关信息，实现了高效的脑图学习

Abstract: Brain graph learning has demonstrated significant achievements in the fields
of neuroscience and artificial intelligence. However, existing methods struggle
to selectively learn disease-related knowledge, leading to heavy parameters and
computational costs. This challenge diminishes their efficiency, as well as
limits their practicality for real-world clinical applications. To this end, we
propose a lightweight Brain PathoGraph Learning (BrainPoG) model that enables
efficient brain graph learning by pathological pattern filtering and
pathological feature distillation. Specifically, BrainPoG first contains a
filter to extract the pathological pattern formulated by highly
disease-relevant subgraphs, achieving graph pruning and lesion localization. A
PathoGraph is therefore constructed by dropping less disease-relevant subgraphs
from the whole brain graph. Afterwards, a pathological feature distillation
module is designed to reduce disease-irrelevant noise features and enhance
pathological features of each node in the PathoGraph. BrainPoG can exclusively
learn informative disease-related knowledge while avoiding less relevant
information, achieving efficient brain graph learning. Extensive experiments on
four benchmark datasets demonstrate that BrainPoG exhibits superiority in both
model performance and computational efficiency across various brain disease
detection tasks.

Abstract: The goal of coreset selection methods is to identify representative subsets
of datasets for efficient model training. Yet, existing methods often ignore
the possibility of annotation errors and require fixed pruning ratios, making
them impractical in real-world settings. We present HyperCore, a robust and
adaptive coreset selection framework designed explicitly for noisy
environments. HyperCore leverages lightweight hypersphere models learned per
class, embedding in-class samples close to a hypersphere center while naturally
segregating out-of-class samples based on their distance. By using Youden's J
statistic, HyperCore can adaptively select pruning thresholds, enabling
automatic, noise-aware data pruning without hyperparameter tuning. Our
experiments reveal that HyperCore consistently surpasses state-of-the-art
coreset selection methods, especially under noisy and low-data regimes.
HyperCore effectively discards mislabeled and ambiguous points, yielding

Motivation: 现有的核集选择方法需要在整个数据集上计算昂贵的训练信号（如梯度、决策边界估计等），这与核集选择旨在避免训练所有样本的目的相矛盾。

Method: 提出SubZeroCore方法，将子模覆盖度和密度整合到单一目标函数中，通过基于闭式解的采样策略来优化平衡这两个目标，使用单个超参数控制局部密度测量的期望覆盖度。

Result: 尽管无需训练，SubZeroCore在性能上能与基于训练的方法相媲美，在高修剪率下显著优于基线方法，同时大幅减少计算开销，对标签噪声表现出更强的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: SubZeroCore展示了在实际场景中的有效性和可扩展性，为核集选择提供了一种高效且无需训练的解决方案。

Abstract: The goal of coreset selection is to identify representative subsets of
datasets for efficient model training. Yet, existing approaches paradoxically
require expensive training-based signals, e.g., gradients, decision boundary
estimates or forgetting counts, computed over the entire dataset prior to
pruning, which undermines their very purpose by requiring training on samples
they aim to avoid. We introduce SubZeroCore, a novel, training-free coreset
selection method that integrates submodular coverage and density into a single,
unified objective. To achieve this, we introduce a sampling strategy based on a
closed-form solution to optimally balance these objectives, guided by a single
hyperparameter that explicitly controls the desired coverage for local density
measures. Despite no training, extensive evaluations show that SubZeroCore
matches training-based baselines and significantly outperforms them at high
pruning rates, while dramatically reducing computational overhead. SubZeroCore
also demonstrates superior robustness to label noise, highlighting its
practical effectiveness and scalability for real-world scenarios.

Motivation: 传统4DVAR成本函数难以优化且计算密集，需要解决时间序列依赖性和计算效率问题。

Method: 使用神经网络参数化时空状态，通过物理约束损失函数直接融入物理规律，实现并行时间优化。

Result: 在二维不可压缩Navier-Stokes方程上测试，相比基线4DVAR产生更稳定的初始条件估计，无伪振荡。

Conclusion: 神经场重新参数化方法简化了4DVAR实现，降低了计算成本，且无需真实状态数据，适用性更广。

Abstract: Four-dimensional variational data assimilation (4DVAR) is a cornerstone of
numerical weather prediction, but its cost function is difficult to optimize
and computationally intensive. We propose a neural field-based reformulation in
which the full spatiotemporal state is represented as a continuous function
parameterized by a neural network. This reparameterization removes the
time-sequential dependency of classical 4DVAR, enabling parallel-in-time
optimization in parameter space. Physical constraints are incorporated directly
through a physics-informed loss, simplifying implementation and reducing
computational cost. We evaluate the method on the two-dimensional
incompressible Navier--Stokes equations with Kolmogorov forcing. Compared to a
baseline 4DVAR implementation, the neural reparameterized variants produce more
stable initial condition estimates without spurious oscillations. Notably,
unlike most machine learning-based approaches, our framework does not require
access to ground-truth states or reanalysis data, broadening its applicability
to settings with limited reference information.

Method: 招募15名无手部、活动或认知障碍的MS患者和12名匹配对照，完成单任务和双任务手部灵巧测试，使用fNIRS测量双侧前额叶和感觉运动皮层的脑血流动力学反应，采用机器学习框架分析数据

Result: K-近邻分类器在单任务中准确率达75.0%，双任务中66.7%。XAI分析显示最重要的脑区是同侧半球的顶下小叶/角回和中央前回，MS组活动抑制且神经血管反应较慢。脱氧血红蛋白比常规的氧合血红蛋白是更好的预测指标

Conclusion: 这种非传统的fNIRS数据分析方法揭示了新的脑活动生物标志物，有助于开发个性化的脑刺激靶点

Abstract: People with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) complain of problems with hand dexterity
and cognitive fatigue. However, in many cases, impairments are subtle and
difficult to detect. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a
non-invasive neuroimaging technique that measures brain hemodynamic responses
during cognitive or motor tasks. We aimed to detect brain activity biomarkers
that could explain subjective reports of cognitive fatigue while completing
dexterous tasks and provide targets for future brain stimulation treatments. We
recruited 15 people with MS who did not have a hand (Nine Hole Peg Test
[NHPT]), mobility, or cognitive impairment, and 12 age- and sex-matched
controls. Participants completed two types of hand dexterity tasks with their
dominant hand, single task and dual task (NHPT while holding a ball between the
fifth finger and hypothenar eminence of the same hand). We analyzed fNIRS data
(oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin levels) using a machine learning
framework to classify MS patients from controls based on their brain activation
patterns in bilateral prefrontal and sensorimotor cortices. The K-Nearest
Neighbor classifier achieved an accuracy of 75.0% for single manual dexterity
tasks and 66.7% for the more complex dual manual dexterity tasks. Using XAI, we
found that the most important brain regions contributing to the machine
learning model were the supramarginal/angular gyri and the precentral gyrus
(sensory integration and motor regions) of the ipsilateral hemisphere, with
suppressed activity and slower neurovascular response in the MS group. During
both tasks, deoxygenated hemoglobin levels were better predictors than the
conventional measure of oxygenated hemoglobin. This nonconventional method of
fNIRS data analysis revealed novel brain activity biomarkers that can help
develop personalized brain stimulation targets.

*Zihan Yu,Guanren Wang,Jingtao Ding,Huandong Wang,Yong Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了有效信息准则(EIC)，通过评估公式作为信息处理系统的数值稳定性来衡量其结构合理性，从而提升符号回归方法发现的公式的可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有符号回归方法仅使用复杂度指标作为可解释性的代理，忽略了公式的内部数学结构，导致发现的公式虽然形式紧凑但结构难以分析。

Method: 将公式视为具有特定内部结构的信息处理系统，通过计算精度限制下有效数字的丢失或舍入噪声的放大来识别不合理结构。

Result: EIC与搜索式符号回归算法结合提升了Pareto前沿性能，与生成式算法结合将预训练样本需求减少了2-4倍，与人类专家对公式可解释性偏好的吻合度达70.2%。

Conclusion: EIC通过衡量公式中的不合理结构，实际上反映了公式的可解释性，为符号回归提供了更准确的可解释性评估标准。

Abstract: Symbolic regression discovers accurate and interpretable formulas to describe
given data, thereby providing scientific insights for domain experts and
promoting scientific discovery. However, existing symbolic regression methods
often use complexity metrics as a proxy for interoperability, which only
considers the size of the formula but ignores its internal mathematical
structure. Therefore, while they can discover formulas with compact forms, the
discovered formulas often have structures that are difficult to analyze or
interpret mathematically. In this work, inspired by the observation that
physical formulas are typically numerically stable under limited calculation
precision, we propose the Effective Information Criterion (EIC). It treats
formulas as information processing systems with specific internal structures
and identifies the unreasonable structure in them by the loss of significant
digits or the amplification of rounding noise as data flows through the system.
We find that this criterion reveals the gap between the structural rationality
of models discovered by existing symbolic regression algorithms and real-world
physical formulas. Combining EIC with various search-based symbolic regression
algorithms improves their performance on the Pareto frontier and reduces the
irrational structure in the results. Combining EIC with generative-based
algorithms reduces the number of samples required for pre-training, improving
sample efficiency by 2~4 times. Finally, for different formulas with similar
accuracy and complexity, EIC shows a 70.2% agreement with 108 human experts'
preferences for formula interpretability, demonstrating that EIC, by measuring
the unreasonable structures in formulas, actually reflects the formula's
interpretability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种并发感知的推测解码框架，通过动态调整草稿生成和验证策略来加速GRPO训练过程，解决了高并发条件下推测解码加速效果有限的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO在提升大语言模型推理能力方面表现出色，但其训练过程过于缓慢，主要瓶颈在于每个查询需要自回归生成多个响应。虽然推测解码有望加速，但在高并发训练条件下直接应用效果有限。

Method: 提出了并发感知的推测解码框架，根据实时并发水平动态调整草稿和验证策略；引入在线草稿学习机制，使草稿模型能够使用目标模型的反馈信号持续适应，解决训练过程中分布漂移问题。

Result: 在多个数学推理数据集和模型上的实验结果表明，该方法实现了2.35倍到2.72倍的端到端加速，显著超越了基线方法的效率。

Conclusion: 提出的并发感知推测解码框架和在线草稿学习机制有效解决了GRPO训练过程中的性能瓶颈，大幅提升了训练效率，为强化学习在大语言模型中的应用提供了实用的加速方案。

Abstract: Group relative policy optimization (GRPO) has demonstrated significant
potential in improving the reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) via reinforcement learning. However, its practical deployment is impeded
by an excessively slow training process, primarily attributed to the
computationally intensive autoregressive generation of multiple responses per
query, which makes the generation phase the primary performance bottleneck.
Although speculative decoding presents a promising direction for acceleration,
its direct application in GRPO achieves limited speedup under high-concurrency
training conditions. To overcome this limitation, we propose a
concurrency-aware speculative decoding framework that dynamically adjusts the
drafting and verification strategy according to real-time concurrency levels,
thereby maximizing the acceleration of the generation process. Furthermore, to
address performance degradation arising from distributional drift between the
evolving target model and the fixed draft model during training, we introduce
an online draft learning mechanism that enables the draft model to continuously
adapt using feedback signals from the target model. Experimental results across
multiple mathematical reasoning datasets and models demonstrate that the
proposed method achieves end-to-end speedups of 2.35x to 2.72x, significantly
surpassing baseline approaches in efficiency. The code is available at

TL;DR: 该研究通过分析生理信号对之间的统计关系来改进疲劳检测，发现多信号融合模型优于单信号模型，其中EMG+EEG组合配合XGBoost表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大多数疲劳检测研究关注单一模态，本研究旨在通过分析信号对之间的统计关系来提高分类的鲁棒性。

Method: 使用DROZY数据集，从ECG、EMG、EOG和EEG信号中提取特征，评估了15种信号组合，并使用决策树、随机森林、逻辑回归和XGBoost进行分类。

Result: XGBoost与EMG+EEG组合取得了最佳性能，SHAP分析显示ECG+EOG相关性是关键特征，多信号模型始终优于单信号模型。

Conclusion: 生理信号的特征级融合提高了疲劳监测系统的准确性、可解释性和实际应用性。

Abstract: Fatigue detection using physiological signals is critical in domains such as
transportation, healthcare, and performance monitoring. While most studies
focus on single modalities, this work examines statistical relationships
between signal pairs to improve classification robustness. Using the DROZY
dataset, we extracted features from ECG, EMG, EOG, and EEG across 15 signal
combinations and evaluated them with Decision Tree, Random Forest, Logistic
Regression, and XGBoost. Results show that XGBoost with the EMG EEG combination
achieved the best performance. SHAP analysis highlighted ECG EOG correlation as
a key feature, and multi signal models consistently outperformed single signal
ones. These findings demonstrate that feature level fusion of physiological
signals enhances accuracy, interpretability, and practical applicability of
fatigue monitoring systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统混沌系统预测模型缺乏泛化能力，无法适应数据稀缺的新系统，需要能够零样本或少量样本预测的基础模型。

Method: 使用多尺度架构ScaleFormer结合专家混合层，在多样化混沌动力学语料库上进行预训练，捕获通用模式和系统特定行为。

Result: 在9000多个合成混沌系统上，长期吸引子统计保真度提升40%以上；在5天全球天气预报中实现低于1度的零样本平均误差，且可通过少量样本微调进一步提升。

Conclusion: 科学基础模型的泛化能力源于训练系统的多样性而非数据量，ChaosNexus为混沌系统预测提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurately forecasting chaotic systems, prevalent in domains such as weather
prediction and fluid dynamics, remains a significant scientific challenge. The
inherent sensitivity of these systems to initial conditions, coupled with a
scarcity of observational data, severely constrains traditional modeling
approaches. Since these models are typically trained for a specific system,
they lack the generalization capacity necessary for real-world applications,
which demand robust zero-shot or few-shot forecasting on novel or data-limited
scenarios. To overcome this generalization barrier, we propose ChaosNexus, a
foundation model pre-trained on a diverse corpus of chaotic dynamics.
ChaosNexus employs a novel multi-scale architecture named ScaleFormer augmented
with Mixture-of-Experts layers, to capture both universal patterns and
system-specific behaviors. The model demonstrates state-of-the-art zero-shot
generalization across both synthetic and real-world benchmarks. On a
large-scale testbed comprising over 9,000 synthetic chaotic systems, it
improves the fidelity of long-term attractor statistics by more than 40%
compared to the leading baseline. This robust performance extends to real-world
applications with exceptional data efficiency. For instance, in 5-day global
weather forecasting, ChaosNexus achieves a competitive zero-shot mean error
below 1 degree, a result that further improves with few-shot fine-tuning.
Moreover, experiments on the scaling behavior of ChaosNexus provide a guiding
principle for scientific foundation models: cross-system generalization stems
from the diversity of training systems, rather than sheer data volume.

Motivation: 预测材料属性对于设计更好的电池、半导体和医疗设备至关重要，深度学习能帮助科学家快速找到有前景的材料。

Method: 训练了transformer和EquiformerV2神经网络来预测材料属性，分析了训练数据、模型规模和计算资源三个超参数对性能的影响。

Result: 发现了这些模型的实证缩放规律：损失L与相关超参数N之间存在幂律关系L = α·N^(-β)，其中α和β是常数。

Conclusion: 未来工作可以进一步研究其他神经网络模型（如GemNet和全连接网络）在该领域的缩放规律，并与已训练模型进行比较。

Abstract: Predicting material properties is crucial for designing better batteries,
semiconductors, and medical devices. Deep learning helps scientists quickly
find promising materials by predicting their energy, forces, and stresses.
Companies scale capacities of deep learning models in multiple domains, such as
language modeling, and invest many millions of dollars into such models. Our
team analyzes how scaling training data (giving models more information to
learn from), model sizes (giving models more capacity to learn patterns), and
compute (giving models more computational resources) for neural networks
affects their performance for material property prediction. In particular, we
trained both transformer and EquiformerV2 neural networks to predict material
properties. We find empirical scaling laws for these models: we can predict how
increasing each of the three hyperparameters (training data, model size, and
compute) affects predictive performance. In particular, the loss $L$ can be
measured with a power law relationship $L = \alpha \cdot N^{-\beta}$, where
$\alpha$ and $\beta$ are constants while $N$ is the relevant hyperparameter. We
also incorporate command-line arguments for changing training settings such as
the amount of epochs, maximum learning rate, and whether mixed precision is
enabled. Future work could entail further investigating scaling laws for other
neural network models in this domain, such as GemNet and fully connected
networks, to assess how they compare to the models we trained.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然SAM方法通常能引导训练到更平坦的最小点以获得更好的泛化性能，但研究发现该方法可能收敛到虚假最小点，这影响了其有效性。

Method: 通过理论分析证明虚假最小点的存在性，建立局部收敛条件，并通过实验验证SAM在实践中确实会收敛到这些点。

Result: 证明了SAM存在收敛到虚假最小点的问题，这些点不是原始目标函数的最小值，影响了方法的可靠性。

Conclusion: SAM方法存在收敛到虚假最小点的风险，需要采取相应措施避免，本文提出了简单有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) is a widely used method that steers
training toward flatter minimizers, which typically generalize better. In this
work, however, we show that SAM can converge to hallucinated minimizers --
points that are not minimizers of the original objective. We theoretically
prove the existence of such hallucinated minimizers and establish conditions
for local convergence to them. We further provide empirical evidence
demonstrating that SAM can indeed converge to these points in practice.
Finally, we propose a simple yet effective remedy for avoiding hallucinated
minimizers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏奖励环境中缺乏中间奖励反馈，阻碍了标准多智能体强化学习算法的有效策略学习。

Method: 引入基于偏好的价值分解网络构建隐式多智能体奖励学习模型，生成全局和局部奖励信号，构建双重优势流，并利用大语言模型提供偏好标签。

Result: 在MAMuJoCo和SMACv2等基准测试中取得了优于现有基线的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效解决在线多智能体强化学习中的稀疏奖励挑战。

Abstract: We study the problem of online multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) in
environments with sparse rewards, where reward feedback is not provided at each
interaction but only revealed at the end of a trajectory. This setting, though
realistic, presents a fundamental challenge: the lack of intermediate rewards
hinders standard MARL algorithms from effectively guiding policy learning. To
address this issue, we propose a novel framework that integrates online inverse
preference learning with multi-agent on-policy optimization into a unified
architecture. At its core, our approach introduces an implicit multi-agent
reward learning model, built upon a preference-based value-decomposition
network, which produces both global and local reward signals. These signals are
further used to construct dual advantage streams, enabling differentiated
learning targets for the centralized critic and decentralized actors. In
addition, we demonstrate how large language models (LLMs) can be leveraged to
provide preference labels that enhance the quality of the learned reward model.
Empirical evaluations on state-of-the-art benchmarks, including MAMuJoCo and
SMACv2, show that our method achieves superior performance compared to existing
baselines, highlighting its effectiveness in addressing sparse-reward
challenges in online MARL.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We study masked discrete diffusion -- a flexible paradigm for text generation
in which tokens are progressively corrupted by special mask symbols before
being denoised. Although this approach has demonstrated strong empirical
performance, its theoretical complexity in high-dimensional settings remains
insufficiently understood. Existing analyses largely focus on uniform discrete
diffusion, and more recent attempts addressing masked diffusion either (1)
overlook widely used Euler samplers, (2) impose restrictive bounded-score
assumptions, or (3) fail to showcase the advantages of masked discrete
diffusion over its uniform counterpart. To address this gap, we show that Euler
samplers can achieve $\epsilon$-accuracy in total variation (TV) with
$\tilde{O}(d^{2}\epsilon^{-3/2})$ discrete score evaluations, thereby providing
the first rigorous analysis of typical Euler sampler in masked discrete
diffusion. We then propose a Mask-Aware Truncated Uniformization (MATU)
approach that both removes bounded-score assumptions and preserves unbiased
discrete score approximation. By exploiting the property that each token can be
unmasked at most once, MATU attains a nearly $\epsilon$-free complexity of
$O(d\,\ln d\cdot (1-\epsilon^2))$. This result surpasses existing
uniformization methods under uniform discrete diffusion, eliminating the
$\ln(1/\epsilon)$ factor and substantially speeding up convergence. Our
findings not only provide a rigorous theoretical foundation for masked discrete
diffusion, showcasing its practical advantages over uniform diffusion for text
generation, but also pave the way for future efforts to analyze diffusion-based
language models developed under masking paradigm.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代分析中经常涉及草图双线性形式，现有统一边界要么不适用，要么在一般集合上不够精确，需要开发新的分析框架。

Method: 使用泛型链式方法，引入了处理集合对上的上确界的新技术，并扩展到多个独立草图矩阵求和的情况。

Result: 推导了基于几何复杂度的统一边界，偏差按√T缩放，恢复了J-L引理等已知结果，扩展了RIP型保证，改进了草图联邦学习算法的收敛边界。

Conclusion: 该框架为草图双线性形式提供了统一分析，在联邦学习和多臂老虎机等应用中获得了更优的边界，边界依赖于动作和参数集的几何复杂度而非环境维度。

Abstract: Uniform bounds on sketched inner products of vectors or matrices underpin
several important computational and statistical results in machine learning and
randomized algorithms, including the Johnson-Lindenstrauss (J-L) lemma, the
Restricted Isometry Property (RIP), randomized sketching, and approximate
linear algebra. However, many modern analyses involve *sketched bilinear
forms*, for which existing uniform bounds either do not apply or are not sharp
on general sets. In this work, we develop a general framework to analyze such
sketched bilinear forms and derive uniform bounds in terms of geometric
complexities of the associated sets. Our approach relies on generic chaining
and introduces new techniques for handling suprema over pairs of sets. We
further extend these results to the setting where the bilinear form involves a
sum of $T$ independent sketching matrices and show that the deviation scales as
$\sqrt{T}$. This unified analysis recovers known results such as the J-L lemma
as special cases, while extending RIP-type guarantees. Additionally, we obtain
improved convergence bounds for sketched Federated Learning algorithms where
such cross terms arise naturally due to sketched gradient compression, and
design sketched variants of bandit algorithms with sharper regret bounds that
depend on the geometric complexity of the action and parameter sets, rather
than the ambient dimension.

Motivation: 现有的多智能体系统虽然能够处理超出单个大语言模型上下文窗口的长输入，但其性能严重依赖于手工设计的协作策略和提示工程，限制了泛化能力。

Method: 提出Graph of Agents (GoA)框架，将长上下文建模问题形式化为压缩问题，建立信息论压缩目标，并动态构建输入依赖的协作结构来最大化该目标。

Result: 在Llama 3.1 8B和Qwen3 8B上，GoA在六个文档问答基准测试中，将检索增强生成的平均F1分数提高了5.7%，比使用固定协作结构的强多智能体基线提高了16.35%。即使只有2K上下文窗口，GoA在LongBench上超过了128K上下文窗口的Llama 3.1 8B。

Conclusion: GoA框架通过信息论压缩目标驱动的动态协作结构，显著提升了多智能体系统在长上下文建模中的性能，有效扩展了模型的上下文处理能力。

Abstract: As a model-agnostic approach to long context modeling, multi-agent systems
can process inputs longer than a large language model's context window without
retraining or architectural modifications. However, their performance often
heavily relies on hand-crafted multi-agent collaboration strategies and prompt
engineering, which limit generalizability. In this work, we introduce a
principled framework that formalizes the model-agnostic long context modeling
problem as a compression problem, yielding an information-theoretic compression
objective. Building on this framework, we propose Graph of Agents (GoA), which
dynamically constructs an input-dependent collaboration structure that
maximizes this objective. For Llama 3.1 8B and Qwen3 8B across six document
question answering benchmarks, GoA improves the average $F_1$ score of
retrieval-augmented generation by 5.7\% and a strong multi-agent baseline using
a fixed collaboration structure by 16.35\%, respectively. Even with only a 2K
context window, GoA surpasses the 128K context window Llama 3.1 8B on
LongBench, showing a dramatic increase in effective context length. Our source

Method: 基于Qwen2.5-7B预训练，明确建模分子光谱，统一实验光谱与分子3D结构信息。

Result: 在光谱相关任务上达到最先进性能，NMR、IR和MS基准测试平均准确率0.53；在光谱分析任务上，Spectra-to-SMILES序列准确率15.5%，token准确率41.7%；能够直接从SMILES或光谱输入生成准确的3D分子结构。

Conclusion: MolSpectLLM不仅能在分子解析任务上表现优异，还能桥接光谱分析、分子解析和分子设计，为真实场景中的分子行为建模提供了更全面的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in molecular foundation models have shown impressive
performance in molecular property prediction and de novo molecular design, with
promising applications in areas such as drug discovery and reaction prediction.
Nevertheless, most existing approaches rely exclusively on SMILES
representations and overlook both experimental spectra and 3D structural
information-two indispensable sources for capturing molecular behavior in
real-world scenarios. This limitation reduces their effectiveness in tasks
where stereochemistry, spatial conformation, and experimental validation are
critical. To overcome these challenges, we propose MolSpectLLM, a molecular
foundation model pretrained on Qwen2.5-7B that unifies experimental
spectroscopy with molecular 3D structure. By explicitly modeling molecular
spectra, MolSpectLLM achieves state-of-the-art performance on spectrum-related
tasks, with an average accuracy of 0.53 across NMR, IR, and MS benchmarks.
MolSpectLLM also shows strong performance on the spectra analysis task,
obtaining 15.5% sequence accuracy and 41.7% token accuracy on
Spectra-to-SMILES, substantially outperforming large general-purpose LLMs. More
importantly, MolSpectLLM not only achieves strong performance on molecular
elucidation tasks, but also generates accurate 3D molecular structures directly
from SMILES or spectral inputs, bridging spectral analysis, molecular
elucidation, and molecular design.

Motivation: 随着LLM上下文窗口增大（128K token），直接输入完整文档成为RAG的替代方案，但存在token效率低、"迷失在中间"现象加剧、模型容量有限时干扰增强等问题。

Method: 提出LDAR（学习分散注意力感知检索），自适应检索上下文以减轻干扰性段落的干扰。

Result: 在多种LLM架构和六个知识密集型基准测试上的广泛实验证明了该方法的有效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 需要在信息覆盖和干扰之间取得平衡，LDAR方法在减少token使用的同时实现了更高的性能。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a framework for grounding Large
Language Models (LLMs) in external, up-to-date information. However, recent
advancements in context window size allow LLMs to process inputs of up to 128K
tokens or more, offering an alternative strategy: supplying the full document
context directly to the model, rather than relying on RAG to retrieve a subset
of contexts. Nevertheless, this emerging alternative strategy has notable
limitations: (i) it is token-inefficient to handle large and potentially
redundant contexts; (ii) it exacerbates the `lost in the middle' phenomenon;
and (iii) under limited model capacity, it amplifies distraction, ultimately
degrading LLM output quality. In this paper, we propose LDAR (Learning
Distraction-Aware Retrieval), an adaptive retriever that learns to retrieve
contexts in a way that mitigates interference from distracting passages,
thereby achieving significantly higher performance with reduced token usage
compared to long-context approaches. Extensive experiments across diverse LLM
architectures and six knowledge-intensive benchmarks demonstrate the
effectiveness and robustness of our approach, highlighting the importance of
balancing the trade-off between information coverage and distraction.

Motivation: 现有方法在从少量非结构化输入中同时发现逻辑事实和归纳逻辑规则方面存在挑战：ILP需要指定背景知识且计算成本高，MLLMs容易出现感知幻觉。

Method: 基于MLLMs即使在幻觉情况下也能提出结构正确规则的关键观察，自动构建具有修剪搜索空间的ILP任务，利用ILP系统基于修正的逻辑事实和形式归纳推理输出规则。

Conclusion: ILP-CoT成功地将ILP和MLLMs相结合，有效解决了逻辑规则归纳中的关键挑战，为多模态逻辑推理提供了新思路。

Abstract: We propose ILP-CoT, a method that bridges Inductive Logic Programming (ILP)
and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for abductive logical rule
induction. The task involves both discovering logical facts and inducing
logical rules from a small number of unstructured textual or visual inputs,
which still remain challenging when solely relying on ILP, due to the
requirement of specified background knowledge and high computational cost, or
MLLMs, due to the appearance of perceptual hallucinations. Based on the key
observation that MLLMs could propose structure-correct rules even under
hallucinations, our approach automatically builds ILP tasks with pruned search
spaces based on the rule structure proposals from MLLMs, and utilizes ILP
system to output rules built upon rectified logical facts and formal inductive
reasoning. Its effectiveness is verified through challenging logical induction

### [284] [Zubov-Net: Adaptive Stability for Neural ODEs Reconciling Accuracy with Robustness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21879)
*Chaoyang Luo,Yan Zou,Nanjing Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Zubov-Net是一个自适应稳定学习框架，通过将Zubov方程重新表述为吸引域与规定吸引域之间的一致性表征，解决了神经网络ODE中鲁棒性与准确性的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管神经ODE由于其动力学系统特性而具有内在的输入扰动鲁棒性，但现有方法往往需要施加Lyapunov稳定性条件来提供形式化鲁棒性保证，这导致了鲁棒性与准确性之间的紧张关系。

Method: 提出Zubov-Net框架，通过三方损失（一致性损失、分类损失和分离损失）和并行边界采样算法共同优化神经ODE和Lyapunov函数，并设计了基于输入注意力的凸神经网络来增强Lyapunov函数的判别性。

Result: 实验表明，Zubov-Net在保持高分类准确性的同时，显著提高了对各种随机噪声和对抗攻击的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该工作通过主动控制吸引域几何形状的新范式，成功调和了神经ODE的准确性和鲁棒性，为稳定学习提供了理论保证和实用框架。

Abstract: Despite neural ordinary differential equations (Neural ODEs) exhibiting
intrinsic robustness under input perturbations due to their dynamical systems
nature, recent approaches often involve imposing Lyapunov-based stability
conditions to provide formal robustness guarantees. However, a fundamental
challenge remains: the tension between robustness and accuracy, primarily
stemming from the difficulty in imposing appropriate stability conditions. To
address this, we propose an adaptive stable learning framework named Zubov-Net,
which innovatively reformulates Zubov's equation into a consistency
characterization between regions of attraction (RoAs) and prescribed RoAs
(PRoAs). Building on this consistency, we introduce a new paradigm for actively
controlling the geometry of RoAs by directly optimizing PRoAs to reconcile
accuracy and robustness. Our approach is realized through tripartite losses
(consistency, classification, and separation losses) and a parallel boundary
sampling algorithm that co-optimizes the Neural ODE and the Lyapunov function.
To enhance the discriminativity of Lyapunov functions, we design an
input-attention-based convex neural network via a softmax attention mechanism
that focuses on equilibrium-relevant features and also serves as weight
normalization to maintain training stability in deep architectures.
Theoretically, we prove that minimizing the tripartite loss guarantees
consistent alignment of PRoAs-RoAs, trajectory stability, and non-overlapping
PRoAs. Moreover, we establish stochastic convex separability with tighter
probability bounds and fewer dimensionality requirements to justify the convex
design in Lyapunov functions. Experimentally, Zubov-Net maintains high
classification accuracy while significantly improving robustness against
various stochastic noises and adversarial attacks.

TL;DR: RLVR方法在数学、代码等结构化任务中确实有效，但实际收益常被高估。研究发现评估缺陷、数据污染和RLVR成本会导致收益被夸大，提出新的训练评估协议来获得更可靠的结果。

Motivation: 验证RLVR方法在实际应用中的真实效果，解决当前评估中存在的夸大问题，建立更可靠的评估标准。

Method: 使用部分提示污染审计和匹配预算重现，对比基础模型和RL模型的表现，提出包含准确性、基础性和校准弃权的税收感知训练评估协议。

Result: 在清洁、对等控制的评估下，多个头条差距缩小或消失，新协议提供了更可靠的推理增益估计，并修正了先前的一些结论。

Conclusion: RLVR方法具有实际价值且已具备产业应用条件，但需要保持其实用优势的同时，优先考虑可靠性、安全性和测量准确性。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) is a practical and
scalable approach to enhancing large language models in areas such as math,
code, and other structured tasks. Two questions motivate this paper: how much
of the reported gains survive under strictly parity-controlled evaluation, and
whether RLVR is cost-free or exacts a measurable tax. We argue that progress is
real, but gains are often overstated due to three forces - an RLVR tax,
evaluation pitfalls, and data contamination. Using a partial-prompt
contamination audit and matched-budget reproductions across base and RL models,
we show that several headline gaps shrink or vanish under clean,
parity-controlled evaluation. We then propose a tax-aware training and
evaluation protocol that co-optimizes accuracy, grounding, and calibrated
abstention and standardizes budgeting and provenance checks. Applied to recent
RLVR setups, this protocol yields more reliable estimates of reasoning gains
and, in several cases, revises prior conclusions. Our position is constructive:
RLVR is valuable and industry-ready; we advocate keeping its practical benefits
while prioritizing reliability, safety, and measurement.

Motivation: 现有Rademacher复杂度界限只能应用于有限类型的模型，需要为更广泛的现实模型建立理论解释。

Method: 引入神经网络的代数表示和核函数来构建RKHS，结合Koopman算子和群表示理论推导新的复杂度界限。

Result: 得到了适用于更广泛实际模型的Rademacher复杂度界限，解释了高秩权重矩阵模型泛化能力好的现象。

Conclusion: 这项工作为基于Koopman理论的Rademacher复杂度界限在更实际场景中的应用铺平了道路。

Abstract: We derive a new Rademacher complexity bound for deep neural networks using
Koopman operators, group representations, and reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces
(RKHSs). The proposed bound describes why the models with high-rank weight
matrices generalize well. Although there are existing bounds that attempt to
describe this phenomenon, these existing bounds can be applied to limited types
of models. We introduce an algebraic representation of neural networks and a
kernel function to construct an RKHS to derive a bound for a wider range of
realistic models. This work paves the way for the Koopman-based theory for
Rademacher complexity bounds to be valid for more practical situations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为IVT（增量向量变换）的即插即用框架，通过保持与先前任务最优解的线性连接性来缓解类增量学习中的灾难性遗忘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受线性模式连接性（LMC）的启发，发现oracle解通常与先前任务的最优解保持低损失的线性连接，这为解决灾难性遗忘提供了新思路。

Method: IVT周期性地将模型参数传送到经过变换的解，这些解保持与先前任务最优解的线性连接性。使用对角Fisher信息矩阵高效近似变换，适用于无样本和有样本场景。

Result: 在多个数据集上显著提升CIL基线性能：CIFAR-100上PASS基线的最终准确率提升+5.12%，遗忘减少2.54%；FGVCAircraft上CLIP预训练的SLCA基线平均准确率提升+14.93%，最终准确率提升+21.95%。

Conclusion: IVT通过维护线性连接性有效缓解灾难性遗忘，是一种通用且高效的CIL增强方法，适用于各种初始化策略和场景。

Abstract: Class Incremental Learning (CIL) aims to sequentially acquire knowledge of
new classes without forgetting previously learned ones. Despite recent
progress, current CIL methods still exhibit significant performance gaps
compared to their oracle counterparts-models trained with full access to
historical data. Inspired by recent insights on Linear Mode Connectivity (LMC),
we revisit the geometric properties of oracle solutions in CIL and uncover a
fundamental observation: these oracle solutions typically maintain low-loss
linear connections to the optimum of previous tasks. Motivated by this finding,
we propose Increment Vector Transformation (IVT), a novel plug-and-play
framework designed to mitigate catastrophic forgetting during training. Rather
than directly following CIL updates, IVT periodically teleports the model
parameters to transformed solutions that preserve linear connectivity to
previous task optimum. By maintaining low-loss along these connecting paths,
IVT effectively ensures stable performance on previously learned tasks. The
transformation is efficiently approximated using diagonal Fisher Information
Matrices, making IVT suitable for both exemplar-free and exemplar-based
scenarios, and compatible with various initialization strategies. Extensive
experiments on CIFAR-100, FGVCAircraft, ImageNet-Subset, and ImageNet-Full
demonstrate that IVT consistently enhances the performance of strong CIL
baselines. Specifically, on CIFAR-100, IVT improves the last accuracy of the
PASS baseline by +5.12% and reduces forgetting by 2.54%. For the
CLIP-pre-trained SLCA baseline on FGVCAircraft, IVT yields gains of +14.93% in
average accuracy and +21.95% in last accuracy. The code will be released.

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于离散数据的精确引导框架，通过推导给定离散流匹配模型所需分布的精确转移率，显著提高采样效率，只需单次前向传播。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有离散数据引导方法主要基于一阶泰勒近似，但在离散状态空间中近似误差可能很大，需要更精确的解决方案。

Method: 推导出给定离散流匹配模型所需分布的精确转移率，构建统一的引导框架，可无缝应用于掩码扩散模型。

Result: 在能量引导模拟和文本到图像生成、多模态理解任务中的偏好对齐方面展示了有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的离散引导匹配框架提供了精确高效的离散数据后验采样方法，统一了现有引导方法并显著提升效率。

Abstract: Guidance provides a simple and effective framework for posterior sampling by
steering the generation process towards the desired distribution. When modeling
discrete data, existing approaches mostly focus on guidance with the
first-order Taylor approximation to improve the sampling efficiency. However,
such an approximation is inappropriate in discrete state spaces since the
approximation error could be large. A novel guidance framework for discrete
data is proposed to address this problem: We derive the exact transition rate
for the desired distribution given a learned discrete flow matching model,
leading to guidance that only requires a single forward pass in each sampling
step, significantly improving efficiency. This unified novel framework is
general enough, encompassing existing guidance methods as special cases, and it
can also be seamlessly applied to the masked diffusion model. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of our proposed guidance on energy-guided simulations and
preference alignment on text-to-image generation and multimodal understanding
tasks. The code is available through

*Fumin Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Multiplicative-Additive Constrained Models (MACMs)，结合了乘法模型和加法模型的优势，在保持可解释性的同时显著提升了预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在高风险领域如医疗保健中，机器学习模型的可解释性至关重要。广义可加模型(GAMs)虽然可解释但忽略了高阶交互效应，而曲线遍历集回归(CESR)包含所有特征交互但性能不佳。

Method: MACMs在CESR基础上添加了加法部分，解耦了交互项和独立项的系数，扩展了假设空间。模型包含可自然可视化的乘法部分和加法部分。

Result: 实验结果表明，基于神经网络的MACMs在预测性能上显著优于CESR和当前最先进的GAMs。

Conclusion: MACMs在保持可解释性的同时，通过结合乘法交互和加法独立效应，实现了对CESR和GAMs的改进，为高风险领域的机器学习应用提供了更好的解决方案。

Abstract: Interpretability is one of the considerations when applying machine learning
to high-stakes fields such as healthcare that involve matters of life safety.
Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) enhance interpretability by visualizing
shape functions. Nevertheless, to preserve interpretability, GAMs omit
higher-order interaction effects (beyond pairwise interactions), which imposes
significant constraints on their predictive performance. We observe that Curve
Ergodic Set Regression (CESR), a multiplicative model, naturally enables the
visualization of its shape functions and simultaneously incorporates both
interactions among all features and individual feature effects. Nevertheless,
CESR fails to demonstrate superior performance compared to GAMs. We introduce
Multiplicative-Additive Constrained Models (MACMs), which augment CESR with an
additive part to disentangle the intertwined coefficients of its interactive
and independent terms, thus effectively broadening the hypothesis space. The
model is composed of a multiplicative part and an additive part, whose shape
functions can both be naturally visualized, thereby assisting users in
interpreting how features participate in the decision-making process.
Consequently, MACMs constitute an improvement over both CESR and GAMs. The
experimental results indicate that neural network-based MACMs significantly
outperform both CESR and the current state-of-the-art GAMs in terms of
predictive performance.

Conclusion: 论文为有限训练样本下生成模型的行为提供了理论分析框架，揭示了生成过程的本质特征，对理解生成模型的泛化能力具有重要意义。

Abstract: This paper investigates the theoretical behavior of generative models under
finite training populations. Within the stochastic interpolation generative
framework, we derive closed-form expressions for the optimal velocity field and
score function when only a finite number of training samples are available. We
demonstrate that, under some regularity conditions, the deterministic
generative process exactly recovers the training samples, while the stochastic
generative process manifests as training samples with added Gaussian noise.
Beyond the idealized setting, we consider model estimation errors and introduce
formal definitions of underfitting and overfitting specific to generative
models. Our theoretical analysis reveals that, in the presence of estimation
errors, the stochastic generation process effectively produces convex
combinations of training samples corrupted by a mixture of uniform and Gaussian
noise. Experiments on generation tasks and downstream tasks such as
classification support our theory.

Motivation: 建筑能耗时间序列分析具有挑战性，因为数据具有非线性和多尺度特性。传统方法难以有效捕捉这些复杂模式，需要更直观和可解释的分析框架。

Method: 将1D时间序列数据转换为3D图形表示：使用连续小波变换(CWT)捕捉时间动态，使用递归图(RP)定位频率异常。然后在这些3D编码上微调视觉语言大模型(VLLMs)。

Result: 在真实建筑能耗数据集上验证，微调后的VLLMs能成功监控建筑状态、识别重复异常并生成优化建议。Idefics-7B VLLM在Sharjah大学能耗数据集上，使用CWT和RP的验证损失分别为0.0952和0.1064，优于直接在原始时间序列数据上微调的结果(0.1176)。

Conclusion: 该工作连接了时间序列分析和可视化，为能源分析提供了一个可扩展且可解释的框架，通过视觉语言模型实现了对复杂能耗模式的直观理解。

Abstract: The analysis of complex building time-series for actionable insights and
recommendations remains challenging due to the nonlinear and multi-scale
characteristics of energy data. To address this, we propose a framework that
fine-tunes visual language large models (VLLMs) on 3D graphical representations
of the data. The approach converts 1D time-series into 3D representations using
continuous wavelet transforms (CWTs) and recurrence plots (RPs), which capture
temporal dynamics and localize frequency anomalies. These 3D encodings enable
VLLMs to visually interpret energy-consumption patterns, detect anomalies, and
provide recommendations for energy efficiency. We demonstrate the framework on
real-world building-energy datasets, where fine-tuned VLLMs successfully
monitor building states, identify recurring anomalies, and generate
optimization recommendations. Quantitatively, the Idefics-7B VLLM achieves
validation losses of 0.0952 with CWTs and 0.1064 with RPs on the University of
Sharjah energy dataset, outperforming direct fine-tuning on raw time-series
data (0.1176) for anomaly detection. This work bridges time-series analysis and
visualization, providing a scalable and interpretable framework for energy
analytics.

Motivation: 理解为什么softmax在注意力机制中优于其他替代方案（如线性注意力），因为现有理论工作主要关注更易分析的线性化注意力。

Method: 基于统计物理思想，在高维极限下分析单位置回归任务，使用序参数描述泛化性能，比较不同激活函数的性能。

Result: 在总体水平上，softmax达到贝叶斯风险，而线性注意力存在根本性不足；在有限样本情况下，softmax虽非贝叶斯最优，但仍持续优于线性注意力。

Conclusion: softmax在注意力机制中的优势得到了理论验证，其性能优于线性注意力，并讨论了基于梯度算法的优化连接。

Abstract: Large language models rely on attention mechanisms with a softmax activation.
Yet the dominance of softmax over alternatives (e.g., component-wise or linear)
remains poorly understood, and many theoretical works have focused on the
easier-to-analyze linearized attention. In this work, we address this gap
through a principled study of the single-location regression task, where the
output depends on a linear transformation of a single input token at a random
location. Building on ideas from statistical physics, we develop an analysis of
attention-based predictors in the high-dimensional limit, where generalization
performance is captured by a small set of order parameters. At the population
level, we show that softmax achieves the Bayes risk, whereas linear attention
fundamentally falls short. We then examine other activation functions to
identify which properties are necessary for optimal performance. Finally, we
analyze the finite-sample regime: we provide an asymptotic characterization of
the test error and show that, while softmax is no longer Bayes-optimal, it
consistently outperforms linear attention. We discuss the connection with
optimization by gradient-based algorithms.

Conclusion: SIHD框架通过自适应层次结构和结构信息利用，有效解决了长时域稀疏奖励环境中的离线策略学习问题

Abstract: Diffusion-based generative methods have shown promising potential for
modeling trajectories from offline reinforcement learning (RL) datasets, and
hierarchical diffusion has been introduced to mitigate variance accumulation
and computational challenges in long-horizon planning tasks. However, existing
approaches typically assume a fixed two-layer diffusion hierarchy with a single
predefined temporal scale, which limits adaptability to diverse downstream
tasks and reduces flexibility in decision making. In this work, we propose
SIHD, a novel Structural Information-based Hierarchical Diffusion framework for
effective and stable offline policy learning in long-horizon environments with
sparse rewards. Specifically, we analyze structural information embedded in
offline trajectories to construct the diffusion hierarchy adaptively, enabling
flexible trajectory modeling across multiple temporal scales. Rather than
relying on reward predictions from localized sub-trajectories, we quantify the
structural information gain of each state community and use it as a
conditioning signal within the corresponding diffusion layer. To reduce
overreliance on offline datasets, we introduce a structural entropy regularizer
that encourages exploration of underrepresented states while avoiding
extrapolation errors from distributional shifts. Extensive evaluations on
challenging offline RL tasks show that SIHD significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines in decision-making performance and demonstrates
superior generalization across diverse scenarios.

Motivation: 现有基于强化学习的攻击方法容易陷入有限的攻击模式，难以覆盖广泛的恶意行为，需要明确的多样性目标。

Method: 使用强化学习训练攻击者LLM，定期对受害者模型进行安全微调，使已利用区域的奖励减少，迫使攻击者探索新的漏洞区域。

Result: Active Attacks将跨攻击成功率从0.07%提升至31.28%，相对提升超过400倍，计算成本仅增加6%。

Conclusion: 该方法能自然诱导从易到难的探索课程，逐步发现广泛的局部攻击模式，组合起来覆盖多模式分布。

Abstract: We address the challenge of generating diverse attack prompts for large
language models (LLMs) that elicit harmful behaviors (e.g., insults, sexual
content) and are used for safety fine-tuning. Rather than relying on manual
prompt engineering, attacker LLMs can be trained with reinforcement learning
(RL) to automatically generate such prompts using only a toxicity classifier as
a reward. However, capturing a wide range of harmful behaviors is a significant
challenge that requires explicit diversity objectives. Existing
diversity-seeking RL methods often collapse to limited modes: once high-reward
prompts are found, exploration of new regions is discouraged. Inspired by the
active learning paradigm that encourages adaptive exploration, we introduce
\textit{Active Attacks}, a novel RL-based red-teaming algorithm that adapts its
attacks as the victim evolves. By periodically safety fine-tuning the victim
LLM with collected attack prompts, rewards in exploited regions diminish, which
forces the attacker to seek unexplored vulnerabilities. This process naturally
induces an easy-to-hard exploration curriculum, where the attacker progresses
beyond easy modes toward increasingly difficult ones. As a result, Active
Attacks uncovers a wide range of local attack modes step by step, and their
combination achieves wide coverage of the multi-mode distribution. Active
Attacks, a simple plug-and-play module that seamlessly integrates into existing
RL objectives, unexpectedly outperformed prior RL-based methods -- including
GFlowNets, PPO, and REINFORCE -- by improving cross-attack success rates
against GFlowNets, the previous state-of-the-art, from 0.07% to 31.28% (a
relative gain greater than $400\ \times$) with only a 6% increase in
computation. Our code is publicly available

Conclusion: 难度自适应推理方法为LALMs提供了智能推理能力，通过适应问题复杂度来优化推理过程，为未来工作提供了有价值的见解。

Abstract: Large Audio Language Models (LALMs), powered by the chain-of-thought (CoT)
paradigm, have shown remarkable reasoning capabilities. Intuitively, different
problems often require varying depths of reasoning. While some methods can
determine whether to reason for a given problem, they typically lack a
fine-grained mechanism to modulate how much to reason. This often results in a
``one-size-fits-all'' reasoning depth, which generates redundant overthinking
for simple questions while failing to allocate sufficient thought to complex
ones. In this paper, we conduct an in-depth analysis of LALMs and find that an
effective and efficient LALM should reason smartly by adapting its reasoning
depth to the problem's complexity. To achieve this, we propose a
difficulty-adaptive reasoning method for LALMs. Specifically, we propose a
reward function that dynamically links reasoning length to the model's
perceived problem difficulty. This reward encourages shorter, concise reasoning
for easy tasks and more elaborate, in-depth reasoning for complex ones.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method is both effective and
efficient, simultaneously improving task performance and significantly reducing
the average reasoning length. Further analysis on reasoning structure paradigm
offers valuable insights for future work.

Result: 在四个公开数据集上的实验表明，GRAMDTI持续优于现有最先进基线方法

Conclusion: 高阶多模态对齐、自适应模态利用和辅助监督对于稳健且可泛化的DTI预测具有显著优势

Abstract: Drug target interaction (DTI) prediction is a cornerstone of computational
drug discovery, enabling rational design, repurposing, and mechanistic
insights. While deep learning has advanced DTI modeling, existing approaches
primarily rely on SMILES protein pairs and fail to exploit the rich multimodal
information available for small molecules and proteins. We introduce GRAMDTI, a
pretraining framework that integrates multimodal molecular and protein inputs
into unified representations. GRAMDTI extends volume based contrastive learning
to four modalities, capturing higher-order semantic alignment beyond
conventional pairwise approaches. To handle modality informativeness, we
propose adaptive modality dropout, dynamically regulating each modality's
contribution during pre-training. Additionally, IC50 activity measurements,
when available, are incorporated as weak supervision to ground representations
in biologically meaningful interaction strengths. Experiments on four publicly
available datasets demonstrate that GRAMDTI consistently outperforms state of
the art baselines. Our results highlight the benefits of higher order
multimodal alignment, adaptive modality utilization, and auxiliary supervision
for robust and generalizable DTI prediction.

Method: 通过理论分析CFG在多模态条件分布下的采样过程，识别三个连续阶段，并通过实验验证理论预测。

Conclusion: CFG的采样过程分为三个阶段，强引导在语义对齐和多样性之间存在权衡，时变引导调度是有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) is widely used to improve conditional fidelity
in diffusion models, but its impact on sampling dynamics remains poorly
understood. Prior studies, often restricted to unimodal conditional
distributions or simplified cases, provide only a partial picture. We analyze
CFG under multimodal conditionals and show that the sampling process unfolds in
three successive stages. In the Direction Shift stage, guidance accelerates
movement toward the weighted mean, introducing initialization bias and norm
growth. In the Mode Separation stage, local dynamics remain largely neutral,
but the inherited bias suppresses weaker modes, reducing global diversity. In
the Concentration stage, guidance amplifies within-mode contraction,
diminishing fine-grained variability. This unified view explains a widely
observed phenomenon: stronger guidance improves semantic alignment but
inevitably reduces diversity. Experiments support these predictions, showing
that early strong guidance erodes global diversity, while late strong guidance
suppresses fine-grained variation. Moreover, our theory naturally suggests a
time-varying guidance schedule, and empirical results confirm that it
consistently improves both quality and diversity.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结构化目标引导强化学习方法，通过LLM生成可重用的结构化目标规划函数和动作剪枝机制，提高RL智能体在复杂环境中的探索效率和长期规划能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界决策任务通常发生在复杂开放环境中，传统RL方法在探索效率和长期规划方面存在挑战。现有LLM增强RL方法依赖频繁的LLM调用且存在语义不匹配问题。

Method: SGRL方法包含结构化目标规划器和目标条件动作剪枝器。前者利用LLM生成带优先级的可重用目标生成函数，后者通过动作掩码机制过滤与当前目标不一致的动作。

Result: 在Crafter和Craftax-Classic环境上的实验结果表明，SGRL相比现有最先进方法取得了更优越的性能。

Conclusion: SGRL方法通过结构化目标规划和动作剪枝机制，有效解决了LLM增强RL中的语义不匹配问题，显著提升了RL智能体的探索效率和决策性能。

Abstract: Real-world decision-making tasks typically occur in complex and open
environments, posing significant challenges to reinforcement learning (RL)
agents' exploration efficiency and long-horizon planning capabilities. A
promising approach is LLM-enhanced RL, which leverages the rich prior knowledge
and strong planning capabilities of LLMs to guide RL agents in efficient
exploration. However, existing methods mostly rely on frequent and costly LLM
invocations and suffer from limited performance due to the semantic mismatch.
In this paper, we introduce a Structured Goal-guided Reinforcement Learning
(SGRL) method that integrates a structured goal planner and a goal-conditioned
action pruner to guide RL agents toward efficient exploration. Specifically,
the structured goal planner utilizes LLMs to generate a reusable, structured
function for goal generation, in which goals are prioritized. Furthermore, by
utilizing LLMs to determine goals' priority weights, it dynamically generates
forward-looking goals to guide the agent's policy toward more promising
decision-making trajectories. The goal-conditioned action pruner employs an
action masking mechanism that filters out actions misaligned with the current
goal, thereby constraining the RL agent to select goal-consistent policies. We
evaluate the proposed method on Crafter and Craftax-Classic, and experimental
results demonstrate that SGRL achieves superior performance compared to
existing state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: Concept-SAE是一个通过混合解耦策略创建语义基础概念token的框架，解决了传统稀疏自编码器特征模糊不可靠的问题，实现了对模型行为的因果探测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统稀疏自编码器发现的特征具有模糊性和无基础性，无法可靠地用于模型行为的主动因果探测。

Method: 采用双重监督的混合解耦策略，创建语义基础的概念token，通过直接干预和系统定位来探测内部概念与预测之间的因果联系。

Result: 该方法产生的token具有显著忠实性和空间局部性，在解耦性能上优于其他方法，能够有效探测模型内部概念与预测的因果联系以及对抗性漏洞。

Conclusion: Concept-SAE为超越相关性解释、实现模型行为的机制性因果探测提供了经过验证的蓝图。

Abstract: Standard Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) excel at discovering a dictionary of a
model's learned features, offering a powerful observational lens. However, the
ambiguous and ungrounded nature of these features makes them unreliable
instruments for the active, causal probing of model behavior. To solve this, we
introduce Concept-SAE, a framework that forges semantically grounded concept
tokens through a novel hybrid disentanglement strategy. We first quantitatively
demonstrate that our dual-supervision approach produces tokens that are
remarkably faithful and spatially localized, outperforming alternative methods
in disentanglement. This validated fidelity enables two critical applications:
(1) we probe the causal link between internal concepts and predictions via
direct intervention, and (2) we probe the model's failure modes by
systematically localizing adversarial vulnerabilities to specific layers.
Concept-SAE provides a validated blueprint for moving beyond correlational
interpretation to the mechanistic, causal probing of model behavior.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AEGIS框架通过重采样现有训练边来增强稀疏二分知识图谱的链接预测性能，避免伪造端点，在稀疏和人工稀疏化图谱上均能提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决稀疏二分知识图谱中数据不足和边稀疏导致的链接预测困难问题。

Method: 提出AEGIS边缘增强框架，采用均匀重采样或逆度偏置重采样现有训练边，保持原始节点集不变，避免伪造端点。

Result: 在Amazon和MovieLens数据集上，基于拷贝的AEGIS变体与基线相当，而语义KNN增强是唯一能恢复AUC和校准的方法；在GDP图谱上，语义KNN实现最大AUC提升和Brier分数降低。

Conclusion: 真实性约束的重采样是稀疏二分链接预测的数据高效策略，当有信息丰富的节点描述时，语义增强能提供额外提升。

Abstract: Bipartite knowledge graphs in niche domains are typically data-poor and
edge-sparse, which hinders link prediction. We introduce AEGIS (Authentic Edge
Growth In Sparsity), an edge-only augmentation framework that resamples
existing training edges -either uniformly simple or with inverse-degree bias
degree-aware -thereby preserving the original node set and sidestepping
fabricated endpoints. To probe authenticity across regimes, we consider
naturally sparse graphs (game design pattern's game-pattern network) and induce
sparsity in denser benchmarks (Amazon, MovieLens) via high-rate bond
percolation. We evaluate augmentations on two complementary metrics: AUC-ROC
(higher is better) and the Brier score (lower is better), using two-tailed
paired t-tests against sparse baselines. On Amazon and MovieLens, copy-based
AEGIS variants match the baseline while the semantic KNN augmentation is the
only method that restores AUC and calibration; random and synthetic edges
remain detrimental. On the text-rich GDP graph, semantic KNN achieves the
largest AUC improvement and Brier score reduction, and simple also lowers the
Brier score relative to the sparse control. These findings position
authenticity-constrained resampling as a data-efficient strategy for sparse
bipartite link prediction, with semantic augmentation providing an additional
boost when informative node descriptions are available.

TL;DR: WeatherPEFT是一个针对天气基础模型的高效微调框架，通过动态提示和随机Fisher引导的自适应选择，在保持性能的同时大幅减少可训练参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的参数高效微调方法无法有效处理天气下游任务的特殊挑战，如变量异质性、分辨率多样性和时空覆盖变化，导致在天气基础模型上性能不佳。

Method: WeatherPEFT包含两个创新：前向传播中的任务自适应动态提示（TADP）通过内外模式提取动态注入嵌入权重；反向传播中的随机Fisher引导自适应选择（SFAS）利用Fisher信息识别关键参数并引入随机性稳定选择。

Result: 在三个下游任务上，WeatherPEFT使用更少的可训练参数实现了与全微调相当的性能，而现有PEFT方法存在显著差距。

Conclusion: WeatherPEFT为天气基础模型提供了一种高效且有效的微调解决方案，解决了现有方法在天气任务中的局限性。

Abstract: While recent advances in machine learning have equipped Weather Foundation
Models (WFMs) with substantial generalization capabilities across diverse
downstream tasks, the escalating computational requirements associated with
their expanding scale increasingly hinder practical deployment. Current
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, designed for vision or language
tasks, fail to address the unique challenges of weather downstream tasks, such
as variable heterogeneity, resolution diversity, and spatiotemporal coverage
variations, leading to suboptimal performance when applied to WFMs. To bridge
this gap, we introduce WeatherPEFT, a novel PEFT framework for WFMs
incorporating two synergistic innovations. First, during the forward pass,
Task-Adaptive Dynamic Prompting (TADP) dynamically injects the embedding
weights within the encoder to the input tokens of the pre-trained backbone via
internal and external pattern extraction, enabling context-aware feature
recalibration for specific downstream tasks. Furthermore, during
backpropagation, Stochastic Fisher-Guided Adaptive Selection (SFAS) not only
leverages Fisher information to identify and update the most task-critical
parameters, thereby preserving invariant pre-trained knowledge, but also
introduces randomness to stabilize the selection. We demonstrate the
effectiveness and efficiency of WeatherPEFT on three downstream tasks, where
existing PEFT methods show significant gaps versus Full-Tuning, and WeatherPEFT
achieves performance parity with Full-Tuning using fewer trainable parameters.
The code of this work will be released.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在各种语言任务上表现出色，但在组合问题（如数独、旅行商问题等）上表现不佳，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 将数独规则的模仿学习与显式的深度优先搜索策略相结合，包括有根据的猜测和回溯，使用标准的GPT-2模型。

Result: 在数独任务上达到了99%的准确率，优于之前的神经符号方法。

Conclusion: 该方法成功地将大语言模型应用于NP类问题求解，通过结合模仿学习和搜索策略实现了高性能，并建立了与Min-Sum Set Cover问题的理论联系。

Abstract: Despite their proficiency in various language tasks, Large Language Models
(LLMs) struggle with combinatorial problems like Satisfiability, Traveling
Salesman Problem, or even basic arithmetic. We address this gap through a novel
approach for solving problems in the class NP. We focus on the paradigmatic
task of Sudoku and achieve state-of-the-art accuracy (99\%) compared to prior
neuro-symbolic approaches. Unlike prior work that used custom architectures,
our method employs a vanilla decoder-only Transformer (GPT-2) without external
tools or function calling. Our method integrates imitation learning of simple
Sudoku rules with an explicit Depth-First Search (DFS) exploration strategy
involving informed guessing and backtracking. Moving beyond imitation learning,
we seek to minimize the number of guesses until reaching a solution. We provide
a rigorous analysis of this setup formalizing its connection to a contextual
variant of Min-Sum Set Cover, a well-studied problem in algorithms and
stochastic optimization.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MCGM是一个轻量级的即插即用模块，通过高效聚类操作为几何图神经网络提供分层全局上下文，解决了传统方法在建模长程相互作用时的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 几何图神经网络在捕捉分子几何结构方面表现出色，但其局部偏置的消息传递机制限制了长程相互作用的建模。现有解决方案存在根本性限制：扩展截止半径会导致计算成本随距离立方增长；物理启发核缺乏通用性；傅里叶空间方法需要复杂参数调优。

Method: MCGM通过多阶段聚类全局建模，构建原子簇的多分辨率层次结构，通过动态分层聚类提取全局信息，并通过学习变换传播这些上下文，最终通过残差连接增强原子特征。

Result: 在OE62能量预测中平均减少26.2%的误差；在AQM上达到最先进精度（能量17.0 meV，力4.9 meV/Å），同时比Neural P3M少使用20%的参数。

Conclusion: MCGM是一个有效的解决方案，能够为几何GNN提供分层全局上下文，显著提升长程相互作用建模能力，同时保持计算效率。

Abstract: Geometric graph neural networks (GNNs) excel at capturing molecular geometry,
yet their locality-biased message passing hampers the modeling of long-range
interactions. Current solutions have fundamental limitations: extending cutoff
radii causes computational costs to scale cubically with distance;
physics-inspired kernels (e.g., Coulomb, dispersion) are often system-specific
and lack generality; Fourier-space methods require careful tuning of multiple
parameters (e.g., mesh size, k-space cutoff) with added computational overhead.
We introduce Multi-stage Clustered Global Modeling (MCGM), a lightweight,
plug-and-play module that endows geometric GNNs with hierarchical global
context through efficient clustering operations. MCGM builds a multi-resolution
hierarchy of atomic clusters, distills global information via dynamic
hierarchical clustering, and propagates this context back through learned
transformations, ultimately reinforcing atomic features via residual
connections. Seamlessly integrated into four diverse backbone architectures,
MCGM reduces OE62 energy prediction error by an average of 26.2%. On AQM, MCGM
achieves state-of-the-art accuracy (17.0 meV for energy, 4.9 meV/{\AA} for
forces) while using 20% fewer parameters than Neural P3M. Code will be made
available upon acceptance.

TL;DR: 提出正交稀疏自编码器(OrtSAE)，通过强制特征正交性来解决传统SAE中的特征吸收和特征组合问题，提高特征解耦能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统稀疏自编码器存在特征吸收（专用特征捕获通用特征实例）和特征组合（独立特征合并为复合表示）的问题，导致表示不完整和特征纠缠。

Method: 引入新的训练过程，惩罚SAE特征间的高余弦相似度，强制学习正交特征，同时保持线性计算复杂度。

Result: OrtSAE发现更多独特特征（+9%），显著减少特征吸收（-65%）和组合（-15%），在虚假相关性去除任务上性能提升6%，其他下游任务性能与传统SAE相当。

Conclusion: 正交约束能有效缓解SAE的特征纠缠问题，提升特征解耦能力，且不增加显著计算开销。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are a technique for sparse decomposition of neural
network activations into human-interpretable features. However, current SAEs
suffer from feature absorption, where specialized features capture instances of
general features creating representation holes, and feature composition, where
independent features merge into composite representations. In this work, we
introduce Orthogonal SAE (OrtSAE), a novel approach aimed to mitigate these
issues by enforcing orthogonality between the learned features. By implementing
a new training procedure that penalizes high pairwise cosine similarity between
SAE features, OrtSAE promotes the development of disentangled features while
scaling linearly with the SAE size, avoiding significant computational
overhead. We train OrtSAE across different models and layers and compare it
with other methods. We find that OrtSAE discovers 9% more distinct features,
reduces feature absorption (by 65%) and composition (by 15%), improves
performance on spurious correlation removal (+6%), and achieves on-par
performance for other downstream tasks compared to traditional SAEs.

Abstract: Latent space is one of the key concepts in generative AI, offering powerful
means for creative exploration through vector manipulation. However, diffusion
models like Stable Diffusion lack the intuitive latent vector control found in
GANs, limiting their flexibility for artistic expression. This paper introduces
\workname, a framework for integrating customizable latent space operations
into the diffusion process. By enabling direct manipulation of conceptual and
spatial representations, this approach expands creative possibilities in
generative art. We demonstrate the potential of this framework through two
artworks, \textit{Infinitepedia} and \textit{Latent Motion}, highlighting its
use in conceptual blending and dynamic motion generation. Our findings reveal
latent space structures with semantic and meaningless regions, offering
insights into the geometry of diffusion models and paving the way for further
explorations of latent space.

Motivation: 针对点云降维中保持局部非凸结构的需求，提出边界自由的方法来保留绕路诱导的局部非凸性。

Method: 构建k-NN图，识别欧几里得距离与最短路径比率低于阈值的可接受对，聚合其归一化方向形成半正定非凸结构矩阵，使用该矩阵的前k个特征向量进行投影。

Result: 提供了两种可验证保证：成对后验证书约束每个可接受对的投影后失真，以及平均情况谱边界将期望捕获方向能量与结构矩阵谱联系起来。

Conclusion: CDP方法能够有效保持局部非凸结构，并提供可验证的失真保证，评估协议使实践者能够在数据上检查这些保证。

Abstract: We propose Convexity-Driven Projection (CDP), a boundary-free linear method
for dimensionality reduction of point clouds that targets preserving
detour-induced local non-convexity. CDP builds a $k$-NN graph, identifies
admissible pairs whose Euclidean-to-shortest-path ratios are below a threshold,
and aggregates their normalized directions to form a positive semidefinite
non-convexity structure matrix. The projection uses the top-$k$ eigenvectors of
the structure matrix. We give two verifiable guarantees. A pairwise
a-posteriori certificate that bounds the post-projection distortion for each
admissible pair, and an average-case spectral bound that links expected
captured direction energy to the spectrum of the structure matrix, yielding
quantile statements for typical distortion. Our evaluation protocol reports
fixed- and reselected-pairs detour errors and certificate quantiles, enabling
practitioners to check guarantees on their data.

Motivation: GRPO算法在存在准确奖励模型时有效，但在多目标设置中容易受到奖励黑客攻击，即优化一个目标而以牺牲其他目标为代价。

Method: 提出MO-GRPO，扩展GRPO算法，通过根据奖励函数值的方差自动重新加权奖励函数，无需手动调整奖励函数尺度。

Result: 在四个领域评估MO-GRPO：多臂老虎机问题、模拟控制任务、机器翻译任务和指令跟随任务。MO-GRPO通过均匀分布奖励组件之间的相关性实现稳定学习，优于GRPO。

Conclusion: MO-GRPO是多目标强化学习问题中一个有前景的算法，能够稳定学习并均匀处理多个目标。

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has been shown to be an effective
algorithm when an accurate reward model is available. However, such a highly
reliable reward model is not available in many real-world tasks. In this paper,
we particularly focus on multi-objective settings, in which we identify that
GRPO is vulnerable to reward hacking, optimizing only one of the objectives at
the cost of the others. To address this issue, we propose MO-GRPO, an extension
of GRPO with a simple normalization method to reweight the reward functions
automatically according to the variances of their values. We first show
analytically that MO-GRPO ensures that all reward functions contribute evenly
to the loss function while preserving the order of preferences, eliminating the
need for manual tuning of the reward functions' scales. Then, we evaluate
MO-GRPO experimentally in four domains: (i) the multi-armed bandits problem,
(ii) simulated control task (Mo-Gymnasium), (iii) machine translation tasks on
the WMT benchmark (En-Ja, En-Zh), and (iv) instruction following task. MO-GRPO
achieves stable learning by evenly distributing correlations among the
components of rewards, outperforming GRPO, showing MO-GRPO to be a promising
algorithm for multi-objective reinforcement learning problems.

Motivation: 现有EEG基础模型未能充分捕捉通道间和脑区间的交互信息，且由于不同数据集电极配置差异，要么用自注意力近似空间结构，要么限制在有限通道上训练。此外，当前模型很少在自监督预训练中学习状态感知表示。

Method: 提出BrainPro模型，包含检索式空间学习块来灵活捕捉不同电极布局下的通道和脑区级交互，以及脑状态解耦块通过并行编码器和解耦损失实现状态感知表示学习。

Conclusion: BrainPro通过创新的空间学习和状态解耦设计，能够无缝适应多样化任务和硬件设置，为EEG分析提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive technique for recording brain
electrical activity, widely used in brain-computer interface (BCI) and
healthcare. Recent EEG foundation models trained on large-scale datasets have
shown improved performance and generalizability over traditional decoding
methods, yet significant challenges remain. Existing models often fail to
explicitly capture channel-to-channel and region-to-region interactions, which
are critical sources of information inherently encoded in EEG signals. Due to
varying channel configurations across datasets, they either approximate spatial
structure with self-attention or restrict training to a limited set of common
channels, sacrificing flexibility and effectiveness. Moreover, although EEG
datasets reflect diverse brain states such as emotion, motor, and others,
current models rarely learn state-aware representations during self-supervised
pre-training. To address these gaps, we propose BrainPro, a large EEG model
that introduces a retrieval-based spatial learning block to flexibly capture
channel- and region-level interactions across varying electrode layouts, and a
brain state-decoupling block that enables state-aware representation learning
through parallel encoders with decoupling and region-aware reconstruction
losses. This design allows BrainPro to adapt seamlessly to diverse tasks and
hardware settings. Pre-trained on an extensive EEG corpus, BrainPro achieves
state-of-the-art performance and robust generalization across nine public BCI
datasets. Our codes and the pre-trained weights will be released.

Conclusion: 提出的类内对比损失结合边界损失的方法能够有效提升知识蒸馏中软标签的质量和多样性。

Abstract: Since the advent of knowledge distillation, much research has focused on how
the soft labels generated by the teacher model can be utilized effectively.
Existing studies points out that the implicit knowledge within soft labels
originates from the multi-view structure present in the data. Feature
variations within samples of the same class allow the student model to
generalize better by learning diverse representations. However, in existing
distillation methods, teacher models predominantly adhere to ground-truth
labels as targets, without considering the diverse representations within the
same class. Therefore, we propose incorporating an intra-class contrastive loss
during teacher training to enrich the intra-class information contained in soft
labels. In practice, we find that intra-class loss causes instability in
training and slows convergence. To mitigate these issues, margin loss is
integrated into intra-class contrastive learning to improve the training
stability and convergence speed. Simultaneously, we theoretically analyze the
impact of this loss on the intra-class distances and inter-class distances. It
has been proved that the intra-class contrastive loss can enrich the
intra-class diversity. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed method.

Conclusion: 该研究为部分参数迁移提供了理论依据，有助于更好地理解迁移学习中的参数重用机制。

Abstract: Parameter transfer is a central paradigm in transfer learning, enabling
knowledge reuse across tasks and domains by sharing model parameters between
upstream and downstream models. However, when only a subset of parameters from
the upstream model is transferred to the downstream model, there remains a lack
of theoretical understanding of the conditions under which such partial
parameter reuse is beneficial and of the factors that govern its effectiveness.
To address this gap, we analyze a setting in which both the upstream and
downstream models are ReLU convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Within this
theoretical framework, we characterize how the inherited parameters act as
carriers of universal knowledge and identify key factors that amplify their
beneficial impact on the target task. Furthermore, our analysis provides
insight into why, in certain cases, transferring parameters can lead to lower
test accuracy on the target task than training a new model from scratch.
Numerical experiments and real-world data experiments are conducted to
empirically validate our theoretical findings.

Motivation: 探索激活导向技术作为微调替代方案的安全性和有效性，验证其是否真能提供精确、可解释且更安全的模型控制。

Method: 在不同模型家族上进行广泛实验，测试随机方向导向和基于稀疏自编码器的良性特征导向对有害请求合规率的影响，并构建通用攻击向量。

Result: 随机方向导向可将有害合规率从0%提升至2-27%；稀疏自编码器导向进一步增加2-4%；20个随机向量组合可创建通用攻击，显著提高对未见请求的有害合规率。

Conclusion: 激活导向技术会破坏模型安全防护，精确控制模型内部状态并不能保证精确控制模型行为，挑战了通过可解释性实现安全的范式。

Abstract: Activation steering is a promising technique for controlling LLM behavior by
adding semantically meaningful vectors directly into a model's hidden states
during inference. It is often framed as a precise, interpretable, and
potentially safer alternative to fine-tuning. We demonstrate the opposite:
steering systematically breaks model alignment safeguards, making it comply
with harmful requests. Through extensive experiments on different model
families, we show that even steering in a random direction can increase the
probability of harmful compliance from 0% to 2-27%. Alarmingly, steering benign
features from a sparse autoencoder (SAE), a common source of interpretable
directions, increases these rates by a further 2-4%. Finally, we show that
combining 20 randomly sampled vectors that jailbreak a single prompt creates a
universal attack, significantly increasing harmful compliance on unseen
requests. These results challenge the paradigm of safety through
interpretability, showing that precise control over model internals does not
guarantee precise control over model behavior.

TL;DR: 提出了NL-SME方法，首次在梯度反演攻击中引入非线性参数轨迹建模，显著提升了联邦学习多步场景下的数据重建效果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于代理模型的方法假设线性参数轨迹，严重低估了SGD的非线性复杂性，限制了攻击效果

Method: 使用可学习的二次贝塞尔曲线替代线性插值，通过控制点捕捉SGD的弯曲特性，结合正则化和dvec缩放机制增强表达能力

Result: 在CIFAR-100和FEMNIST数据集上的实验表明，NL-SME在所有指标上显著优于基线方法，余弦相似度损失实现数量级改进，同时保持计算效率

Conclusion: 这项工作揭示了联邦学习多步更新范式中的隐私脆弱性，并为开发鲁棒防御策略提供了新视角

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) preserves privacy by keeping raw data local, yet
Gradient Inversion Attacks (GIAs) pose significant threats. In FedAVG
multi-step scenarios, attackers observe only aggregated gradients, making data
reconstruction challenging. Existing surrogate model methods like SME assume
linear parameter trajectories, but we demonstrate this severely underestimates
SGD's nonlinear complexity, fundamentally limiting attack effectiveness. We
propose Non-Linear Surrogate Model Extension (NL-SME), the first method to
introduce nonlinear parametric trajectory modeling for GIAs. Our approach
replaces linear interpolation with learnable quadratic B\'ezier curves that
capture SGD's curved characteristics through control points, combined with
regularization and dvec scaling mechanisms for enhanced expressiveness.
Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100 and FEMNIST datasets show NL-SME
significantly outperforms baselines across all metrics, achieving
order-of-magnitude improvements in cosine similarity loss while maintaining
computational efficiency.This work exposes heightened privacy vulnerabilities
in FL's multi-step update paradigm and offers novel perspectives for developing
robust defense strategies.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success across a range
of learning tasks. However, scaling GNNs to large graphs remains a significant
challenge, especially for graph-level tasks. In this work, we introduce
SHAKE-GNN, a novel scalable graph-level GNN framework based on a hierarchy of
Kirchhoff Forests, a class of random spanning forests used to construct
stochastic multi-resolution decompositions of graphs. SHAKE-GNN produces
multi-scale representations, enabling flexible trade-offs between efficiency
and performance. We introduce an improved, data-driven strategy for selecting
the trade-off parameter and analyse the time-complexity of SHAKE-GNN.
Experimental results on multiple large-scale graph classification benchmarks
demonstrate that SHAKE-GNN achieves competitive performance while offering
improved scalability.

TL;DR: 提出了一种考虑时间动态的算法追索框架，通过强化学习方法生成在预定时间范围内保持有效的可行建议


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有算法追索研究主要关注模型更新的鲁棒性，而忽视了竞争性、资源受限环境中追索建议的时间动态性及其对未来申请人池的影响

Method: 开发了时间感知的算法追索框架，显式建模候选人群对建议的适应性响应，并引入基于强化学习的追索算法来捕捉环境演化动态

Result: 在复杂模拟环境中的广泛实验表明，该方法显著优于现有基线，在可行性和长期有效性之间提供了优越的平衡

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了将时间和行为动态纳入实际追索系统设计的重要性

Abstract: Algorithmic recourse seeks to provide individuals with actionable
recommendations that increase their chances of receiving favorable outcomes
from automated decision systems (e.g., loan approvals). While prior research
has emphasized robustness to model updates, considerably less attention has
been given to the temporal dynamics of recourse--particularly in competitive,
resource-constrained settings where recommendations shape future applicant
pools. In this work, we present a novel time-aware framework for algorithmic
recourse, explicitly modeling how candidate populations adapt in response to
recommendations. Additionally, we introduce a novel reinforcement learning
(RL)-based recourse algorithm that captures the evolving dynamics of the
environment to generate recommendations that are both feasible and valid. We
design our recommendations to be durable, supporting validity over a predefined
time horizon T. This durability allows individuals to confidently reapply after
taking time to implement the suggested changes. Through extensive experiments
in complex simulation environments, we show that our approach substantially
outperforms existing baselines, offering a superior balance between feasibility
and long-term validity. Together, these results underscore the importance of
incorporating temporal and behavioral dynamics into the design of practical
recourse systems.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的混合结构学习方法latent MMHC，用于学习混合类型变量之间的有向关系，并在排球运动员心理特征分析中应用，揭示了心理技能网络结构和传播效应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心理属性很少孤立运作，教练需要理解相关特征之间的网络关系。现有方法难以处理混合类型变量（序数问卷分数、分类人口统计、连续指标）的有向关系学习。

Method: 提出了latent MMHC方法，结合潜在高斯copula和基于约束的骨架，通过约束的基于评分的精化返回单个DAG。还研究了bootstrap聚合变体以提高稳定性。

Result: 在模拟中，latent MMHC在结构汉明距离和边召回率方面优于最近的copula方法，同时保持高特异性。在排球应用中，学习到的网络围绕目标设定和自信组织心理技能，情绪唤醒连接动机和焦虑，大五人格特质位于技能集群上游。

Conclusion: 该方法为运动心理特征分析提供了一个可解释、数据驱动的框架，并为运动员发展决策提供支持。

Abstract: Psychological attributes rarely operate in isolation: coaches reason about
networks of related traits. We analyze a new dataset of 164 female volleyball
players from Italy's C and D leagues that combines standardized psychological
profiling with background information. To learn directed relationships among
mixed-type variables (ordinal questionnaire scores, categorical demographics,
continuous indicators), we introduce latent MMHC, a hybrid structure learner
that couples a latent Gaussian copula and a constraint-based skeleton with a
constrained score-based refinement to return a single DAG. We also study a
bootstrap-aggregated variant for stability. In simulations spanning sample
size, sparsity, and dimension, latent Max-Min Hill-Climbing (MMHC) attains
lower structural Hamming distance and higher edge recall than recent
copula-based learners while maintaining high specificity. Applied to
volleyball, the learned network organizes mental skills around goal setting and
self-confidence, with emotional arousal linking motivation and anxiety, and
locates Big-Five traits (notably neuroticism and extraversion) upstream of
skill clusters. Scenario analyses quantify how improvements in specific skills
propagate through the network to shift preparation, confidence, and
self-esteem. The approach provides an interpretable, data-driven framework for
profiling psychological traits in sport and for decision support in athlete
development.

Motivation: 对抗性机器学习主要关注分类问题，但回归场景中的对抗性规避问题尚未得到充分研究。现有的悲观双层优化方法在分类中表现良好，但尚未适应回归场景。

Method: 提出了一种悲观双层优化程序，专门针对回归场景设计，不要求对手策略具有凸性或唯一性，能够捕捉对手的对抗性本质。

Result: 该方法扩展了对抗性机器学习在回归问题中的应用，为构建更具弹性的回归预测模型提供了理论基础。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了对抗性机器学习在回归场景中的空白，提出的悲观双层优化方法有望在回归问题中有效缓解对抗性威胁。

Abstract: Adversarial machine learning challenges the assumption that the underlying
distribution remains consistent throughout the training and implementation of a
prediction model. In particular, adversarial evasion considers scenarios where
adversaries adapt their data to influence particular outcomes from established
prediction models, such scenarios arise in applications such as spam email
filtering, malware detection and fake-image generation, where security methods
must be actively updated to keep up with the ever-improving generation of
malicious data. Game theoretic models have been shown to be effective at
modelling these scenarios and hence training resilient predictors against such
adversaries. Recent advancements in the use of pessimistic bilevel optimsiation
which remove assumptions about the convexity and uniqueness of the adversary's
optimal strategy have proved to be particularly effective at mitigating threats
to classifiers due to its ability to capture the antagonistic nature of the
adversary. However, this formulation has not yet been adapted to regression
scenarios. This article serves to propose a pessimistic bilevel optimisation
program for regression scenarios which makes no assumptions on the convexity or
uniqueness of the adversary's solutions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了动态双级下采样(D³S)框架，通过样本级和令牌级的下采样策略，优先选择信息量最大的样本和令牌来提升策略优化的效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决无批评方法如GRPO收敛缓慢的问题，这些方法由于包含大量无信息样本和令牌而稀释了关键学习信号。

Method: D³S框架包含两个层级：(1)样本级选择优势方差最大的rollouts子集；(2)令牌级优先选择优势幅度与策略熵乘积高的令牌。采用动态下采样调度防止过拟合。

Result: 在Qwen2.5和Llama3.1上的实验表明，D³S集成到先进RL算法中实现了最先进的性能和泛化能力，同时需要更少的样本和令牌。

Conclusion: D³S框架通过动态双级下采样有效提升了策略优化的效率和性能，在多种推理基准测试中表现出色。

Abstract: Critic-free methods like GRPO reduce memory demands by estimating advantages
from multiple rollouts but tend to converge slowly, as critical learning
signals are diluted by an abundance of uninformative samples and tokens. To
tackle this challenge, we propose the \textbf{Dynamic Dual-Level Down-Sampling
(D$^3$S)} framework that prioritizes the most informative samples and tokens
across groups to improve the efficient of policy optimization. D$^3$S operates
along two levels: (1) the sample-level, which selects a subset of rollouts to
maximize advantage variance ($\text{Var}(A)$). We theoretically proven that
this selection is positively correlated with the upper bound of the policy
gradient norms, yielding higher policy gradients. (2) the token-level, which
prioritizes tokens with a high product of advantage magnitude and policy
entropy ($|A_{i,t}|\times H_{i,t}$), focusing updates on tokens where the
policy is both uncertain and impactful. Moreover, to prevent overfitting to
high-signal data, D$^3$S employs a dynamic down-sampling schedule inspired by
curriculum learning. This schedule starts with aggressive down-sampling to
accelerate early learning and gradually relaxes to promote robust
generalization. Extensive experiments on Qwen2.5 and Llama3.1 demonstrate that
integrating D$^3$S into advanced RL algorithms achieves state-of-the-art
performance and generalization while requiring \textit{fewer} samples and
tokens across diverse reasoning benchmarks. Our code is added in the
supplementary materials and will be made publicly available.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: VITAL是一个基于大语言模型的框架，专门用于处理电子健康记录中不规则采样的生理时间序列数据，通过区分生命体征和实验室测试两种变量类型，有效处理高缺失率问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子健康记录中的时间序列数据存在不规则采样和高缺失率的问题，临床变量根据工作流程和干预时间以不均匀间隔测量，这给建模带来了挑战。

Method: VITAL区分生命体征和实验室测试两种变量类型：将生命体征重新编程到语言空间，使LLM能够捕获时间上下文并通过显式编码处理缺失值；实验室变量则使用代表性汇总值或可学习的[未测量]标记进行嵌入。

Result: 在PhysioNet基准数据集上的广泛评估表明，VITAL优于为不规则时间序列设计的最先进方法，并在高缺失率情况下保持稳健性能。

Conclusion: VITAL框架能够有效处理临床时间序列数据的不规则采样和高缺失率问题，在真实临床场景中表现出色。

Abstract: Irregular sampling and high missingness are intrinsic challenges in modeling
time series derived from electronic health records (EHRs),where clinical
variables are measured at uneven intervals depending on workflow and
intervention timing. To address this, we propose VITAL, a variable-aware, large
language model (LLM) based framework tailored for learning from irregularly
sampled physiological time series. VITAL differentiates between two distinct
types of clinical variables: vital signs, which are frequently recorded and
exhibit temporal patterns, and laboratory tests, which are measured
sporadically and lack temporal structure. It reprograms vital signs into the
language space, enabling the LLM to capture temporal context and reason over
missing values through explicit encoding. In contrast, laboratory variables are
embedded either using representative summary values or a learnable [Not
measured] token, depending on their availability. Extensive evaluations on the
benchmark datasets from the PhysioNet demonstrate that VITAL outperforms state
of the art methods designed for irregular time series. Furthermore, it
maintains robust performance under high levels of missingness, which is
prevalent in real world clinical scenarios where key variables are often
unavailable.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种双切片Wasserstein（DSW）距离作为Wasserstein over Wasserstein（WoW）距离的替代方案，通过利用1维Wasserstein空间与函数空间的等距性，避免了高阶矩的不稳定性，并实现了计算加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的切片WoW加速方法依赖于参数化元测量或高阶矩的存在，导致数值不稳定性。需要一种更稳定且计算高效的替代方案来比较数据集或图像和形状的分布。

Method: 利用1维Wasserstein空间与函数空间L2([0,1])的等距性，引入了一个针对任意Banach空间的通用切片Wasserstein框架。通过高斯过程参数化的无限维L2投影定义1维元测量的切片距离，结合欧几里得单位球上的经典积分得到DSW度量。

Result: DSW最小化与离散化元测量的WoW最小化等价，同时避免了不稳定的高阶矩并实现了计算节省。在数据集、形状和图像上的数值实验验证了DSW作为WoW距离的可扩展替代方案。

Conclusion: DSW提供了一个稳定、计算高效的WoW距离替代方案，通过利用1维Wasserstein等距性避免了数值不稳定性问题，同时保持了理论等价性。

Abstract: Wasserstein distances define a metric between probability measures on
arbitrary metric spaces, including meta-measures (measures over measures). The
resulting Wasserstein over Wasserstein (WoW) distance is a powerful, but
computationally costly tool for comparing datasets or distributions over images
and shapes. Existing sliced WoW accelerations rely on parametric meta-measures
or the existence of high-order moments, leading to numerical instability. As an
alternative, we propose to leverage the isometry between the 1d Wasserstein
space and the quantile functions in the function space $L_2([0,1])$. For this
purpose, we introduce a general sliced Wasserstein framework for arbitrary
Banach spaces. Due to the 1d Wasserstein isometry, this framework defines a
sliced distance between 1d meta-measures via infinite-dimensional
$L_2$-projections, parametrized by Gaussian processes. Combining this 1d
construction with classical integration over the Euclidean unit sphere yields
the double-sliced Wasserstein (DSW) metric for general meta-measures. We show
that DSW minimization is equivalent to WoW minimization for discretized
meta-measures, while avoiding unstable higher-order moments and computational
savings. Numerical experiments on datasets, shapes, and images validate DSW as
a scalable substitute for the WoW distance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种新的向量量化平滑方法，通过最小化每个单纯形顶点与其K个最近邻平滑量化器之间的距离，同时实现紧密近似和防止码本崩溃。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 向量量化在现代机器学习中广泛应用，但其非可微的量化步骤阻碍了梯度反向传播。现有平滑方法通常分别处理紧密近似和码本利用两个需求，缺乏统一解决方案。

Method: 引入简单直观的正则化方法，通过最小化每个单纯形顶点与其K个最近邻平滑量化器之间的距离，同时促进码本利用和保持紧密近似。

Result: 在离散图像自编码和对比语音表示学习等基准测试中，该方法实现了更可靠的码本利用，性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 所提出的正则化方法能够同时满足向量量化平滑的两个关键需求，为向量量化提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Vector quantization, which discretizes a continuous vector space into a
finite set of representative vectors (a codebook), has been widely adopted in
modern machine learning. Despite its effectiveness, vector quantization poses a
fundamental challenge: the non-differentiable quantization step blocks gradient
backpropagation. Smoothed vector quantization addresses this issue by relaxing
the hard assignment of a codebook vector into a weighted combination of
codebook entries, represented as the matrix product of a simplex vector and the
codebook. Effective smoothing requires two properties: (1) smoothed quantizers
should remain close to a onehot vector, ensuring tight approximation, and (2)
all codebook entries should be utilized, preventing code collapse. Existing
methods typically address these desiderata separately. By contrast, the present
study introduces a simple and intuitive regularization that promotes both
simultaneously by minimizing the distance between each simplex vertex and its
$K$-nearest smoothed quantizers. Experiments on representative benchmarks,
including discrete image autoencoding and contrastive speech representation
learning, demonstrate that the proposed method achieves more reliable codebook
utilization and improves performance compared to prior approaches.

TL;DR: 本文系统分析了LLM中后训练N:M激活剪枝方法，发现激活剪枝比权重剪枝在相同稀疏度下能更好地保持生成能力，并推荐8:16稀疏模式作为硬件友好的最优选择。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管半结构化(N:M)剪枝在权重剪枝中已很成熟，但在激活剪枝方面的应用仍未被充分探索，而激活剪枝具有动态、输入自适应压缩和减少I/O开销的潜力。

Method: 评估了轻量级即插即用的误差缓解技术和剪枝标准，建立了硬件友好的基线方法，需要最少的校准。探索了超越NVIDIA标准2:4的稀疏模式，重点关注8:16模式。

Result: 在多个LLM上的实验表明，激活剪枝在相同稀疏度下比权重剪枝能更好地保持生成能力。16:32模式性能接近非结构化稀疏度，但考虑到灵活性和硬件实现复杂度的权衡，8:16模式是更优选择。

Conclusion: 研究为激活剪枝提供了有效的实用方法，并为未来硬件支持更灵活稀疏模式提供了动机。8:16稀疏模式在性能和硬件友好性之间达到了最佳平衡。

Abstract: The demand for efficient large language model (LLM) inference has intensified
the focus on sparsification techniques. While semi-structured (N:M) pruning is
well-established for weights, its application to activation pruning remains
underexplored despite its potential for dynamic, input-adaptive compression and
reductions in I/O overhead. This work presents a comprehensive analysis of
methods for post-training N:M activation pruning in LLMs. Across multiple LLMs,
we demonstrate that pruning activations enables superior preservation of
generative capabilities compared to weight pruning at equivalent sparsity
levels. We evaluate lightweight, plug-and-play error mitigation techniques and
pruning criteria, establishing strong hardware-friendly baselines that require
minimal calibration. Furthermore, we explore sparsity patterns beyond NVIDIA's
standard 2:4, showing that the 16:32 pattern achieves performance nearly on par
with unstructured sparsity. However, considering the trade-off between
flexibility and hardware implementation complexity, we focus on the 8:16
pattern as a superior candidate. Our findings provide both effective practical
methods for activation pruning and a motivation for future hardware to support
more flexible sparsity patterns. Our code is available

TL;DR: DYNAWEIGHT是一种新颖的分布式学习框架，通过动态分配权重来加速去中心化学习过程，特别适用于数据异构场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在完全去中心化基础设施中，由于缺乏集中聚合，本地处理变得至关重要。传统静态权重分配方法无法有效处理数据异构性，需要更智能的聚合方案。

Method: DYNAWEIGHT框架基于邻近服务器在本地数据集上的相对损失动态分配权重，优先选择具有多样化信息的服务器，而不是使用传统的静态权重分配。

Result: 在MNIST、CIFAR10和CIFAR100数据集上的实验表明，DYNAWEIGHT在不同服务器数量和网络拓扑下显著提高了训练速度，且仅需最小的额外通信和内存开销。

Conclusion: DYNAWEIGHT作为一种兼容任何底层服务器级优化算法的聚合方案，具有广泛的适用性和集成潜力，特别适合数据异构的去中心化学习环境。

Abstract: In today's data-sensitive landscape, distributed learning emerges as a vital
tool, not only fortifying privacy measures but also streamlining computational
operations. This becomes especially crucial within fully decentralized
infrastructures where local processing is imperative due to the absence of
centralized aggregation. Here, we introduce DYNAWEIGHT, a novel framework to
information aggregation in multi-agent networks. DYNAWEIGHT offers substantial
acceleration in decentralized learning with minimal additional communication
and memory overhead. Unlike traditional static weight assignments, such as
Metropolis weights, DYNAWEIGHT dynamically allocates weights to neighboring
servers based on their relative losses on local datasets. Consequently, it
favors servers possessing diverse information, particularly in scenarios of
substantial data heterogeneity. Our experiments on various datasets MNIST,
CIFAR10, and CIFAR100 incorporating various server counts and graph topologies,
demonstrate notable enhancements in training speeds. Notably, DYNAWEIGHT
functions as an aggregation scheme compatible with any underlying server-level
optimization algorithm, underscoring its versatility and potential for
widespread integration.

Conclusion: 该方法能够成功从数据中发现对称群结构，并构建高效的等变模型，在多个任务中表现出色。

Abstract: In this study, we introduce a method for learning group (known or unknown)
equivariant functions by learning the associated quadratic form $x^T A x$
corresponding to the group from the data. Certain groups, known as orthogonal
groups, preserve a specific quadratic form, and we leverage this property to
uncover the underlying symmetry group under the assumption that it is
orthogonal. By utilizing the corresponding unique symmetric matrix and its
inherent diagonal form, we incorporate suitable inductive biases into the
neural network architecture, leading to models that are both simplified and
efficient. Our approach results in an invariant model that preserves norms,
while the equivariant model is represented as a product of a norm-invariant
model and a scale-invariant model, where the ``product'' refers to the group
action.
  Moreover, we extend our framework to a more general setting where the
function acts on tuples of input vectors via a diagonal (or product) group
action. In this extension, the equivariant function is decomposed into an
angular component extracted solely from the normalized first vector and a
scale-invariant component that depends on the full Gram matrix of the tuple.
This decomposition captures the inter-dependencies between multiple inputs
while preserving the underlying group symmetry.
  We assess the effectiveness of our framework across multiple tasks, including
polynomial regression, top quark tagging, and moment of inertia matrix
prediction. Comparative analysis with baseline methods demonstrates that our
model consistently excels in both discovering the underlying symmetry and
efficiently learning the corresponding equivariant function.

Motivation: 解耦表示旨在恢复观测数据背后的潜在变化因子，但其识别性仍未完全理解，需要不依赖统计假设的新方法。

Method: 引入机制独立性框架，提出从支撑集、稀疏性到高阶条件的多种独立性准则，并通过图论方法将潜在子空间表征为连通分量。

Result: 证明了每种准则都能在非线性、非可逆混合下实现潜在子空间的识别性，并建立了这些准则之间的层次关系。

Conclusion: 该框架阐明了在不依赖统计假设的情况下解耦表示可被识别的条件，为解耦学习提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Disentangled representations seek to recover latent factors of variation
underlying observed data, yet their identifiability is still not fully
understood. We introduce a unified framework in which disentanglement is
achieved through mechanistic independence, which characterizes latent factors
by how they act on observed variables rather than by their latent distribution.
This perspective is invariant to changes of the latent density, even when such
changes induce statistical dependencies among factors. Within this framework,
we propose several related independence criteria -- ranging from support-based
and sparsity-based to higher-order conditions -- and show that each yields
identifiability of latent subspaces, even under nonlinear, non-invertible
mixing. We further establish a hierarchy among these criteria and provide a
graph-theoretic characterization of latent subspaces as connected components.
Together, these results clarify the conditions under which disentangled
representations can be identified without relying on statistical assumptions.

Result: 在真实世界图数据集测试中，KReTTaH在填补缺失的时间变化边流方面持续优于现有最先进方法

Conclusion: KReTTaH框架为多维数据插补提供了高效且灵活的解决方案，特别适用于图结构数据的动态流估计

Abstract: A regression-based framework for interpretable multi-way data imputation,
termed Kernel Regression via Tensor Trains with Hadamard overparametrization
(KReTTaH), is introduced. KReTTaH adopts a nonparametric formulation by casting
imputation as regression via reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. Parameter
efficiency is achieved through tensors of fixed tensor-train (TT) rank, which
reside on low-dimensional Riemannian manifolds, and is further enhanced via
Hadamard overparametrization, which promotes sparsity within the TT parameter
space. Learning is accomplished by solving a smooth inverse problem posed on
the Riemannian manifold of fixed TT-rank tensors. As a representative
application, the estimation of dynamic graph flows is considered. In this
setting, KReTTaH exhibits flexibility by seamlessly incorporating graph-based
(topological) priors via its inverse problem formulation. Numerical tests on
real-world graph datasets demonstrate that KReTTaH consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art alternatives-including a nonparametric tensor- and a
neural-network-based methods-for imputing missing, time-varying edge flows.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决耗散系统中逆向推理的困难，传统优化方法速度慢、不稳定且难以收敛，需要一种能同时处理前向动态和逆向推理的统一框架。

Method: 提出基于残差可逆消息传递的数学可逆设计，使用共享参数耦合前向动态和逆向推理，不试图逆转底层物理，而是通过双向一致性实现准确预测。

Result: 在三个耗散基准测试中，R-GNS仅用四分之一参数达到更高精度和一致性，逆向推理比基于优化的基线快100倍以上，在目标条件任务中消除了迭代优化。

Conclusion: R-GNS是首个统一耗散流体系统前向和逆向模拟的可逆框架，能够生成复杂目标形状的物理一致轨迹，显著提升了模拟效率和准确性。

Abstract: Simulating physically plausible trajectories toward user-defined goals is a
fundamental yet challenging task in fluid dynamics. While particle-based
simulators can efficiently reproduce forward dynamics, inverse inference
remains difficult, especially in dissipative systems where dynamics are
irreversible and optimization-based solvers are slow, unstable, and often fail
to converge. In this work, we introduce the Reversible Graph Network Simulator
(R-GNS), a unified framework that enforces bidirectional consistency within a
single graph architecture. Unlike prior neural simulators that approximate
inverse dynamics by fitting backward data, R-GNS does not attempt to reverse
the underlying physics. Instead, we propose a mathematically invertible design
based on residual reversible message passing with shared parameters, coupling
forward dynamics with inverse inference to deliver accurate predictions and
efficient recovery of plausible initial states. Experiments on three
dissipative benchmarks (Water-3D, WaterRamps, and WaterDrop) show that R-GNS
achieves higher accuracy and consistency with only one quarter of the
parameters, and performs inverse inference more than 100 times faster than
optimization-based baselines. For forward simulation, R-GNS matches the speed
of strong GNS baselines, while in goal-conditioned tasks it eliminates
iterative optimization and achieves orders-of-magnitude speedups. On
goal-conditioned tasks, R-GNS further demonstrates its ability to complex
target shapes (e.g., characters "L" and "N") through vivid, physically
consistent trajectories. To our knowledge, this is the first reversible
framework that unifies forward and inverse simulation for dissipative fluid
systems.

TL;DR: 论文证明了当模型参数数量p超过数据维度d与样本数n的乘积(dn)时，可以从模型参数中重构整个训练数据集，揭示了数据重构的规律。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究深度学习模型的数据记忆现象，从数据重构角度分析模型何时能够记忆训练数据，而不仅仅是标签拟合。

Method: 在随机特征模型中分析，当p >> dn时，特征空间中训练样本张成的子空间包含足够信息来识别输入空间中的个体样本，并提出基于优化的数据重构方法。

Result: 提出的重构方法在多种架构（随机特征、两层全连接网络、深度残差网络）上都表现良好，验证了当p超过dn阈值时能够恢复整个训练数据集。

Conclusion: 揭示了数据重构的规律：当模型参数数量p超过dn时，可以从模型参数中完全重构训练数据集，这为理解深度学习模型的数据记忆能力提供了新视角。

Abstract: Large-scale deep learning models are known to memorize parts of the training
set. In machine learning theory, memorization is often framed as interpolation
or label fitting, and classical results show that this can be achieved when the
number of parameters $p$ in the model is larger than the number of training
samples $n$. In this work, we consider memorization from the perspective of
data reconstruction, demonstrating that this can be achieved when $p$ is larger
than $dn$, where $d$ is the dimensionality of the data. More specifically, we
show that, in the random features model, when $p \gg dn$, the subspace spanned
by the training samples in feature space gives sufficient information to
identify the individual samples in input space. Our analysis suggests an
optimization method to reconstruct the dataset from the model parameters, and
we demonstrate that this method performs well on various architectures (random
features, two-layer fully-connected and deep residual networks). Our results
reveal a law of data reconstruction, according to which the entire training
dataset can be recovered as $p$ exceeds the threshold $dn$.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SO(n)的单参数子群在机器人学、量子力学和分子结构分析等应用中至关重要，但缺乏自动发现这些子群的方法。

Method: 利用斜对称矩阵的标准Jordan形式建立轨道规范形式，推导H_γ不变函数的标准化表示，通过学习适当参数来发现底层单参数子群。

Result: 在双摆建模、转动惯量预测、顶夸克标记和不变多项式回归等任务中成功恢复了有意义的子群结构，并产生了可解释的对称感知表示。

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效自动发现SO(n)的单参数子群，为对称感知表示学习提供了有力工具。

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for the automatic discovery of one-parameter
subgroups ($H_{\gamma}$) of $SO(3)$ and, more generally, $SO(n)$. One-parameter
subgroups of $SO(n)$ are crucial in a wide range of applications, including
robotics, quantum mechanics, and molecular structure analysis. Our method
utilizes the standard Jordan form of skew-symmetric matrices, which define the
Lie algebra of $SO(n)$, to establish a canonical form for orbits under the
action of $H_{\gamma}$. This canonical form is then employed to derive a
standardized representation for $H_{\gamma}$-invariant functions. By learning
the appropriate parameters, the framework uncovers the underlying one-parameter
subgroup $H_{\gamma}$. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is
demonstrated through tasks such as double pendulum modeling, moment of inertia
prediction, top quark tagging and invariant polynomial regression, where it
successfully recovers meaningful subgroup structure and produces interpretable,
symmetry-aware representations.

Motivation: 现实世界中的顺序决策问题需要平衡性能与公平性，但事先确定合适的权衡很困难，因此需要能够探索多种权衡的算法框架。

Method: 提出了扩展的马尔可夫决策过程fMDP，显式编码个体和群体信息，并制定了计算随时间变化的公平度量的公平框架。

Result: 在招聘和欺诈检测场景中，该框架学习的策略在多个场景下更加公平，仅带来轻微的性能损失，且发现群体公平和个体公平不一定相互蕴含。

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效平衡性能与公平性，为不同问题设置提供了应用指南，特别适用于需要同时考虑多种公平概念的场景。

Abstract: Equity in real-world sequential decision problems can be enforced using
fairness-aware methods. Therefore, we require algorithms that can make suitable
and transparent trade-offs between performance and the desired fairness
notions. As the desired performance-fairness trade-off is hard to specify a
priori, we propose a framework where multiple trade-offs can be explored.
Insights provided by the reinforcement learning algorithm regarding the
obtainable performance-fairness trade-offs can then guide stakeholders in
selecting the most appropriate policy. To capture fairness, we propose an
extended Markov decision process, $f$MDP, that explicitly encodes individuals
and groups. Given this $f$MDP, we formalise fairness notions in the context of
sequential decision problems and formulate a fairness framework that computes
fairness measures over time. We evaluate our framework in two scenarios with
distinct fairness requirements: job hiring, where strong teams must be composed
while treating applicants equally, and fraud detection, where fraudulent
transactions must be detected while ensuring the burden on customers is fairly
distributed. We show that our framework learns policies that are more fair
across multiple scenarios, with only minor loss in performance reward.
Moreover, we observe that group and individual fairness notions do not
necessarily imply one another, highlighting the benefit of our framework in
settings where both fairness types are desired. Finally, we provide guidelines
on how to apply this framework across different problem settings.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有形式化语句相似度评估方法无法平衡语义和结构信息，字符串方法忽略语义，证明方法缺乏分级相似度评分。

Method: 将形式化语句转换为操作符树捕获语法结构，使用TransTED相似性度量（增强的树编辑距离）计算相似度分数。

Conclusion: ASSESS框架有效整合语义和结构信息，为形式化语句相似度评估提供了连续评分，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Statement autoformalization, the automated translation of statements from
natural language into formal languages, has seen significant advancements, yet
the development of automated evaluation metrics remains limited. Existing
metrics for formal statement similarity often fail to balance semantic and
structural information. String-based approaches capture syntactic structure but
ignore semantic meaning, whereas proof-based methods validate semantic
equivalence but disregard structural nuances and, critically, provide no graded
similarity score in the event of proof failure. To address these issues, we
introduce ASSESS (A Semantic and Structural Evaluation Framework for Statement
Similarity), which comprehensively integrates semantic and structural
information to provide a continuous similarity score. Our framework first
transforms formal statements into Operator Trees to capture their syntactic
structure and then computes a similarity score using our novel TransTED
(Transformation Tree Edit Distance) Similarity metric, which enhances
traditional Tree Edit Distance by incorporating semantic awareness through
transformations. For rigorous validation, we present EPLA (Evaluating
Provability and Likeness for Autoformalization), a new benchmark of 524
expert-annotated formal statement pairs derived from miniF2F and ProofNet, with
labels for both semantic provability and structural likeness. Experiments on
EPLA demonstrate that TransTED Similarity outperforms existing methods,
achieving state-of-the-art accuracy and the highest Kappa coefficient. The
benchmark, and implementation code will be made public soon.

Abstract: We introduce WIRE: Wavelet-Induced Rotary Encodings. WIRE extends Rotary
Position Encodings (RoPE), a popular algorithm in LLMs and ViTs, to
graph-structured data. We demonstrate that WIRE is more general than RoPE,
recovering the latter in the special case of grid graphs. WIRE also enjoys a
host of desirable theoretical properties, including equivariance under node
ordering permutation, compatibility with linear attention, and (under select
assumptions) asymptotic dependence on graph resistive distance. We test WIRE on
a range of synthetic and real-world tasks, including identifying monochromatic
subgraphs, semantic segmentation of point clouds, and more standard graph
benchmarks. We find it to be effective in settings where the underlying graph
structure is important.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型遗忘方法存在浅层对齐问题，仅通过生成虚假遗忘神经元来隐藏目标知识，而非真正擦除，导致在后续训练中知识容易被重新学习，存在隐私风险。

Method: 提出Ssiuu遗忘方法，使用归因引导的正则化来防止虚假负影响，确保目标知识被忠实移除，而非仅仅被隐藏。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法能可靠擦除目标知识，在两种实际重训练场景（对抗性注入私有数据和良性攻击使用指令遵循基准）中均优于强基线方法。

Conclusion: 研究强调了开发鲁棒且忠实的遗忘方法对于语言模型安全部署的必要性。

Abstract: Large language models trained on web-scale data can memorize private or
sensitive knowledge, raising significant privacy risks. Although some
unlearning methods mitigate these risks, they remain vulnerable to "relearning"
during subsequent training, allowing a substantial portion of forgotten
knowledge to resurface. In this paper, we show that widely used unlearning
methods cause shallow alignment: instead of faithfully erasing target
knowledge, they generate spurious unlearning neurons that amplify negative
influence to hide it. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Ssiuu, a new
class of unlearning methods that employs attribution-guided regularization to
prevent spurious negative influence and faithfully remove target knowledge.
Experimental results confirm that our method reliably erases target knowledge
and outperforms strong baselines across two practical retraining scenarios: (1)
adversarial injection of private data, and (2) benign attack using an
instruction-following benchmark. Our findings highlight the necessity of robust
and faithful unlearning methods for safe deployment of language models.

Abstract: Reliable detection of bearing faults is essential for maintaining the safety
and operational efficiency of rotating machinery. While recent advances in
machine learning (ML), particularly deep learning, have shown strong
performance in controlled settings, many studies fail to generalize to
real-world applications due to methodological flaws, most notably data leakage.
This paper investigates the issue of data leakage in vibration-based bearing
fault diagnosis and its impact on model evaluation. We demonstrate that common
dataset partitioning strategies, such as segment-wise and condition-wise
splits, introduce spurious correlations that inflate performance metrics. To
address this, we propose a rigorous, leakage-free evaluation methodology
centered on bearing-wise data partitioning, ensuring no overlap between the
physical components used for training and testing. Additionally, we reformulate
the classification task as a multi-label problem, enabling the detection of
co-occurring fault types and the use of prevalence-independent metrics such as
Macro AUROC. Beyond preventing leakage, we also examine the effect of dataset
diversity on generalization, showing that the number of unique training
bearings is a decisive factor for achieving robust performance. We evaluate our
methodology on three widely adopted datasets: CWRU, Paderborn University (PU),
and University of Ottawa (UORED-VAFCLS). This study highlights the importance
of leakage-aware evaluation protocols and provides practical guidelines for
dataset partitioning, model selection, and validation, fostering the
development of more trustworthy ML systems for industrial fault diagnosis
applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在多样化应用中的集成，获取可靠的预测不确定性度量变得至关重要。需要精确区分来自输入数据固有模糊性的偶然不确定性和来自模型局限性的认知不确定性。

Method: 利用量子信息理论中的冯·诺依曼熵，通过语义相似性的细粒度表示来分离总不确定性为偶然不确定性和认知不确定性。

Result: 经验评估表明，Spectral Uncertainty在估计偶然不确定性和总不确定性方面优于现有最先进方法，在多个模型和基准数据集上表现优异。

Conclusion: Spectral Uncertainty提供了一种理论严谨的方法来分解LLM中的不确定性，能够更细致地区分不同语义解释，在不确定性估计方面优于现有方法。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated in diverse
applications, obtaining reliable measures of their predictive uncertainty has
become critically important. A precise distinction between aleatoric
uncertainty, arising from inherent ambiguities within input data, and epistemic
uncertainty, originating exclusively from model limitations, is essential to
effectively address each uncertainty source. In this paper, we introduce
Spectral Uncertainty, a novel approach to quantifying and decomposing
uncertainties in LLMs. Leveraging the Von Neumann entropy from quantum
information theory, Spectral Uncertainty provides a rigorous theoretical
foundation for separating total uncertainty into distinct aleatoric and
epistemic components. Unlike existing baseline methods, our approach
incorporates a fine-grained representation of semantic similarity, enabling
nuanced differentiation among various semantic interpretations in model
responses. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that Spectral Uncertainty
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in estimating both aleatoric and total
uncertainty across diverse models and benchmark datasets.

Method: 基于分层表示在不同任务中变化的观察，提出循环噪声门控机制利用分层信息进行路由，获得任务特定能力；在时间和通道维度上对时间序列token进行路由，并通过精心设计的时空负载均衡损失来建模复杂的时空相关性。

Conclusion: PatchMoE通过任务感知的路由和时空相关性建模，成功解决了传统MoE在时间序列分析中的局限性，为多样化时间序列任务提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Time Series Analysis is widely used in various real-world applications such
as weather forecasting, financial fraud detection, imputation for missing data
in IoT systems, and classification for action recognization. Mixture-of-Experts
(MoE), as a powerful architecture, though demonstrating effectiveness in NLP,
still falls short in adapting to versatile tasks in time series analytics due
to its task-agnostic router and the lack of capability in modeling channel
correlations. In this study, we propose a novel, general MoE-based time series
framework called PatchMoE to support the intricate ``knowledge'' utilization
for distinct tasks, thus task-aware. Based on the observation that hierarchical
representations often vary across tasks, e.g., forecasting vs. classification,
we propose a Recurrent Noisy Gating to utilize the hierarchical information in
routing, thus obtaining task-sepcific capability. And the routing strategy is
operated on time series tokens in both temporal and channel dimensions, and
encouraged by a meticulously designed Temporal \& Channel Load Balancing Loss
to model the intricate temporal and channel correlations. Comprehensive
experiments on five downstream tasks demonstrate the state-of-the-art
performance of PatchMoE.

Conclusion: 扩散自编码器为无线语义通信提供了有效的解决方案，能够更好地学习语义到真实分布的映射，具有更好的可扩展性和性能

Abstract: Semantic communication (SemCom) systems aim to learn the mapping from
low-dimensional semantics to high-dimensional ground-truth. While this is more
akin to a "domain translation" problem, existing frameworks typically emphasize
on channel-adaptive neural encoding-decoding schemes, lacking full exploration
of signal distribution. Moreover, such methods so far have employed
autoencoder-based architectures, where the encoding is tightly coupled to a
matched decoder, causing scalability issues in practice. To address these gaps,
diffusion autoencoder models are proposed for wireless SemCom. The goal is to
learn a "semantic-to-clean" mapping, from the semantic space to the
ground-truth probability distribution. A neural encoder at semantic transmitter
extracts the high-level semantics, and a conditional diffusion model (CDiff) at
the semantic receiver exploits the source distribution for signal-space
denoising, while the received semantic latents are incorporated as the
conditioning input to "steer" the decoding process towards the semantics
intended by the transmitter. It is analytically proved that the proposed
decoder model is a consistent estimator of the ground-truth data. Furthermore,
extensive simulations over CIFAR-10 and MNIST datasets are provided along with
design insights, highlighting the performance compared to legacy autoencoders
and variational autoencoders (VAE). Simulations are further extended to the
multi-user SemCom, identifying the dominating factors in a more realistic
setup.

Motivation: 解决超图划分中的局部最优问题，提高划分质量，特别是在加权顶点集上的表现，同时降低计算复杂度以适应不同规模的数据。

Method: 使用多目标非凸约束松弛模型和加速近端梯度算法生成顶点特征；针对不同数据规模采用两种MST策略：小数据用Prim算法构建MST后剪枝聚类，大数据选择代表性节点构建小MST；引入贪婪迁移、交换和递归MST聚类等细化策略。

Conclusion: 该算法在超图划分质量上具有显著优势，特别是在加权顶点集上表现突出，验证了其竞争力和性能权衡特征。

Abstract: This paper proposes an efficient hypergraph partitioning framework based on a
novel multi-objective non-convex constrained relaxation model. A modified
accelerated proximal gradient algorithm is employed to generate diverse
$k$-dimensional vertex features to avoid local optima and enhance partition
quality. Two MST-based strategies are designed for different data scales: for
small-scale data, the Prim algorithm constructs a minimum spanning tree
followed by pruning and clustering; for large-scale data, a subset of
representative nodes is selected to build a smaller MST, while the remaining
nodes are assigned accordingly to reduce complexity. To further improve
partitioning results, refinement strategies including greedy migration,
swapping, and recursive MST-based clustering are introduced for partitions.
  Experimental results on public benchmark sets demonstrate that the proposed
algorithm achieves reductions in cut size of approximately 2\%--5\% on average
compared to KaHyPar in 2, 3, and 4-way partitioning, with improvements of up to
35\% on specific instances. Particularly on weighted vertex sets, our algorithm
outperforms state-of-the-art partitioners including KaHyPar, hMetis,
Mt-KaHyPar, and K-SpecPart, highlighting its superior partitioning quality and
competitiveness. Furthermore, the proposed refinement strategy improves hMetis
partitions by up to 16\%. A comprehensive evaluation based on virtual instance
methodology and parameter sensitivity analysis validates the algorithm's
competitiveness and characterizes its performance trade-offs.

Abstract: Cross-domain generalization is very important in Time Series Forecasting
because similar historical information may lead to distinct future trends due
to the domain-specific characteristics. Recent works focus on building unimodal
time series foundation models and end-to-end multimodal supervised models.
Since domain-specific knowledge is often contained in modalities like texts,
the former lacks the explicit utilization of them, thus hindering the
performance. The latter is tailored for end-to-end scenarios and does not
support zero-shot inference for cross-domain scenarios. In this work, we
introduce Aurora, a Multimodal Time Series Foundation Model, which supports
multimodal inputs and zero-shot inference. Pretrained on Corss-domain
Multimodal Time Series Corpus, Aurora can adaptively extract and focus on key
domain knowledge contained in corrsponding text or image modalities, thus
possessing strong Cross-domain generalization capability. Through tokenization,
encoding, and distillation, Aurora can extract multimodal domain knowledge as
guidance and then utilizes a Modality-Guided Multi-head Self-Attention to
inject them into the modeling of temporal representations. In the decoding
phase, the multimodal representations are used to generate the conditions and
prototypes of future tokens, contributing to a novel Prototype-Guided Flow
Matching for generative probabilistic forecasting. Comprehensive experiments on
well-recognized benchmarks, including TimeMMD, TSFM-Bench and ProbTS,
demonstrate the consistent state-of-the-art performance of Aurora on both
unimodal and multimodal scenarios.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures in large language models (LLMs)
deliver exceptional performance and reduced inference costs compared to dense
LLMs. However, their large parameter counts result in prohibitive memory
requirements, limiting practical deployment. While existing pruning methods
primarily focus on expert-level pruning, this coarse granularity often leads to
substantial accuracy degradation. In this work, we introduce HEAPr, a novel
pruning algorithm that decomposes experts into smaller, indivisible atomic
experts, enabling more precise and flexible atomic expert pruning. To measure
the importance of each atomic expert, we leverage second-order information
based on principles similar to Optimal Brain Surgeon (OBS) theory. To address
the computational and storage challenges posed by second-order information,
HEAPr exploits the inherent properties of atomic experts to transform the
second-order information from expert parameters into that of atomic expert
parameters, and further simplifies it to the second-order information of atomic
expert outputs. This approach reduces the space complexity from $O(d^4)$, where
d is the model's dimensionality, to $O(d^2)$. HEAPr requires only two forward
passes and one backward pass on a small calibration set to compute the
importance of atomic experts. Extensive experiments on MoE models, including
DeepSeek MoE and Qwen MoE family, demonstrate that HEAPr outperforms existing
expert-level pruning methods across a wide range of compression ratios and
benchmarks. Specifically, HEAPr achieves nearly lossless compression at
compression ratios of 20% ~ 25% in most models, while also reducing FLOPs
nearly by 20%. The code can be found at

Result: 在预测产率任务中，SoDaDE优于之前的表示方法，展示了数据驱动指纹在小数据集上的有效性。

Conclusion: 证明了即使使用小数据集也能创建有效的数据驱动指纹，并建立了可应用于其他领域的工作流程。

Abstract: Computational representations have become crucial in unlocking the recent
growth of machine learning algorithms for chemistry. Initially hand-designed,
machine learning has shown that meaningful representations can be learnt from
data. Chemical datasets are limited and so the representations learnt from data
are generic, being trained on broad datasets which contain shallow information
on many different molecule types. For example, generic fingerprints lack
physical context specific to solvents. However, the use of harmful solvents is
a leading climate-related issue in the chemical industry, and there is a surge
of interest in green solvent replacement. To empower this research, we propose
a new solvent representation scheme by developing Solvent Data Driven
Embeddings (SoDaDE). SoDaDE uses a small transformer model and solvent property
dataset to create a fingerprint for solvents. To showcase their effectiveness,
we use SoDaDE to predict yields on a recently published dataset, outperforming
previous representations. We demonstrate through this paper that data-driven
fingerprints can be made with small datasets and set-up a workflow that can be
explored for other applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习需要大量交互数据，现有方法在训练和部署任务不匹配时性能下降，特别是在分布外设置下现有元强化学习方法通常失败。

Method: APB方法在共享骨干网络前后插入轻量级线性层，实现参数高效微调，在适应过程中保留先验知识。

Result: APB相比标准RL提高了样本效率，并能适应现有元RL基线通常失败的分布外任务。

Conclusion: APB方法通过参数高效微调有效解决了强化学习在任务不匹配情况下的适应问题，特别是在分布外设置下表现出色。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved impressive results across domains,
yet learning an optimal policy typically requires extensive interaction data,
limiting practical deployment. A common remedy is to leverage priors, such as
pre-collected datasets or reference policies, but their utility degrades under
task mismatch between training and deployment. While prior work has sought to
address this mismatch, it has largely been restricted to in-distribution
settings. To address this challenge, we propose Adaptive Policy Backbone (APB),
a meta-transfer RL method that inserts lightweight linear layers before and
after a shared backbone, thereby enabling parameter-efficient fine-tuning
(PEFT) while preserving prior knowledge during adaptation. Our results show
that APB improves sample efficiency over standard RL and adapts to
out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks where existing meta-RL baselines typically
fail.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出渐进式权重加载(PWL)方法，通过先部署轻量学生模型，然后逐步替换为预训练教师模型的层，实现快速初始推理和渐进性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型变得越来越大，导致内存消耗和计算需求增加，模型加载时间和初始推理延迟也随之增加，这在移动和延迟敏感环境中对用户体验产生负面影响。

Method: 提出PWL技术：先部署轻量学生模型，然后逐步用预训练教师模型的层替换学生模型层。引入训练方法对齐学生和教师层的中间特征表示，并提升学生模型的整体输出性能。

Result: 在VGG、ResNet和ViT架构上的实验表明，PWL训练的模型保持有竞争力的蒸馏性能，随着教师层加载逐渐提高准确率，最终达到完整教师模型的准确率，且不损害初始推理速度。

Conclusion: PWL特别适合动态、资源受限的部署场景，在响应性和性能都至关重要的环境中表现出色。

Abstract: Deep learning models have become increasingly large and complex, resulting in
higher memory consumption and computational demands. Consequently, model
loading times and initial inference latency have increased, posing significant
challenges in mobile and latency-sensitive environments where frequent model
loading and unloading are required, which directly impacts user experience.
While Knowledge Distillation (KD) offers a solution by compressing large
teacher models into smaller student ones, it often comes at the cost of reduced
performance. To address this trade-off, we propose Progressive Weight Loading
(PWL), a novel technique that enables fast initial inference by first deploying
a lightweight student model, then incrementally replacing its layers with those
of a pre-trained teacher model. To support seamless layer substitution, we
introduce a training method that not only aligns intermediate feature
representations between student and teacher layers, but also improves the
overall output performance of the student model. Our experiments on VGG,
ResNet, and ViT architectures demonstrate that models trained with PWL maintain
competitive distillation performance and gradually improve accuracy as teacher
layers are loaded-matching the final accuracy of the full teacher model without
compromising initial inference speed. This makes PWL particularly suited for
dynamic, resource-constrained deployments where both responsiveness and
performance are critical.

Abstract: An associative memory (AM) enables cue-response recall, and associative
memorization has recently been noted to underlie the operation of modern neural
architectures such as Transformers. This work addresses a distributed setting
where agents maintain a local AM to recall their own associations as well as
selective information from others. Specifically, we introduce a distributed
online gradient descent method that optimizes local AMs at different agents
through communication over routing trees. Our theoretical analysis establishes
sublinear regret guarantees, and experiments demonstrate that the proposed
protocol consistently outperforms existing online optimization baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究深度神经网络在持续学习中为何会失去可塑性，无法学习新任务而需要重新初始化参数，旨在理解这一现象的根本原因。

Method: 引入τ-可训练性概念，分析Hessian谱崩溃现象，基于Kronecker分解近似提出两种正则化方法：维持高有效特征秩和应用L2惩罚。

Result: 在持续监督学习和强化学习任务上的实验表明，结合这两种正则化方法能有效保持网络的可塑性。

Conclusion: Hessian谱崩溃是深度持续学习中可塑性丧失的关键原因，通过针对性的正则化方法可以有效维持网络的学习能力。

Abstract: We investigate why deep neural networks suffer from \emph{loss of plasticity}
in deep continual learning, failing to learn new tasks without reinitializing
parameters. We show that this failure is preceded by Hessian spectral collapse
at new-task initialization, where meaningful curvature directions vanish and
gradient descent becomes ineffective. To characterize the necessary condition
for successful training, we introduce the notion of $\tau$-trainability and
show that current plasticity preserving algorithms can be unified under this
framework. Targeting spectral collapse directly, we then discuss the Kronecker
factored approximation of the Hessian, which motivates two regularization
enhancements: maintaining high effective feature rank and applying $L2$
penalties. Experiments on continual supervised and reinforcement learning tasks
confirm that combining these two regularizers effectively preserves plasticity.

<details>

Motivation: 生存分析数据常因失访等原因包含不完整的事件信息，这给合成数据生成带来独特挑战。需要同时忠实重现事件时间分布和删失机制，以支持临床研究。

Method: 提出SurvDiff扩散模型，使用生存定制损失函数联合生成混合类型协变量、事件时间和右删失数据，该损失函数编码时间到事件结构并直接优化下游生存任务。

Result: 在多个数据集上，SurvDiff在分布保真度和下游评估指标方面持续优于最先进的生成基线模型。

Conclusion: SurvDiff是首个明确为生成合成生存数据设计的扩散模型，能够真实重现事件时间分布并保持删失机制。

Abstract: Survival analysis is a cornerstone of clinical research by modeling
time-to-event outcomes such as metastasis, disease relapse, or patient death.
Unlike standard tabular data, survival data often come with incomplete event
information due to dropout, or loss to follow-up. This poses unique challenges
for synthetic data generation, where it is crucial for clinical research to
faithfully reproduce both the event-time distribution and the censoring
mechanism. In this paper, we propose SurvDiff, an end-to-end diffusion model
specifically designed for generating synthetic data in survival analysis.
SurvDiff is tailored to capture the data-generating mechanism by jointly
generating mixed-type covariates, event times, and right-censoring, guided by a
survival-tailored loss function. The loss encodes the time-to-event structure
and directly optimizes for downstream survival tasks, which ensures that
SurvDiff (i) reproduces realistic event-time distributions and (ii) preserves
the censoring mechanism. Across multiple datasets, we show that \survdiff
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art generative baselines in both
distributional fidelity and downstream evaluation metrics across multiple
medical datasets. To the best of our knowledge, SurvDiff is the first diffusion
model explicitly designed for generating synthetic survival data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有静态世界模型在面对新颖或罕见配置时表现不佳，需要研究能够自我适应的世界模型来预测环境动态。

Method: 形式化了世界模型的上下文学习，识别了环境识别和环境学习两种核心机制，推导了误差上界，并通过实证研究验证了ICL机制的存在。

Result: 研究发现不同的ICL机制确实存在于世界模型中，长上下文和多样化环境是ICEL出现的关键因素，理论与实证结果一致。

Conclusion: 这些发现展示了自我适应世界模型的潜力，并突出了ICEL出现的关键因素，特别是长上下文和多样化环境的必要性。

Abstract: The capability of predicting environmental dynamics underpins both biological
neural systems and general embodied AI in adapting to their surroundings. Yet
prevailing approaches rest on static world models that falter when confronted
with novel or rare configurations. We investigate in-context environment
learning (ICEL), shifting attention from zero-shot performance to the growth
and asymptotic limits of the world model. Our contributions are three-fold: (1)
we formalize in-context learning of a world model and identify two core
mechanisms: environment recognition and environment learning; (2) we derive
error upper-bounds for both mechanisms that expose how the mechanisms emerge;
and (3) we empirically confirm that distinct ICL mechanisms exist in the world
model, and we further investigate how data distribution and model architecture
affect ICL in a manner consistent with theory. These findings demonstrate the
potential of self-adapting world models and highlight the key factors behind
the emergence of ICEL, most notably the necessity of long context and diverse
environments.

TL;DR: 提出随机激活策略，在LLM前馈层中随机选择SILU或RELU非线性函数，解决RELU的优化问题，并用于预训练和文本生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决RELU激活函数在负输入区域梯度消失的问题，同时利用RELU的稀疏性优势来减少推理计算量。

Method: 在预训练阶段使用随机激活（SILU或RELU的伯努利选择），微调时固定为RELU；在生成任务中直接使用随机激活策略。

Result: 预训练+微调方法比直接使用RELU训练效果更好，推理时CPU速度显著提升；生成任务中表现合理，略逊于最佳确定性方法但能增加文本多样性。

Conclusion: 随机激活策略有效解决了RELU的优化问题，在保持性能的同时实现了推理加速，并为文本生成提供了可控的多样性增强方法。

Abstract: We introduce stochastic activations. This novel strategy randomly selects
between several non-linear functions in the feed-forward layer of a large
language model. In particular, we choose between SILU or RELU depending on a
Bernoulli draw. This strategy circumvents the optimization problem associated
with RELU, namely, the constant shape for negative inputs that prevents the
gradient flow. We leverage this strategy in two ways:
  (1) We use stochastic activations during pre-training and fine-tune the model
with RELU, which is used at inference time to provide sparse latent vectors.
This reduces the inference FLOPs and translates into a significant speedup in
the CPU. Interestingly, this leads to much better results than training from
scratch with the RELU activation function.
  (2) We evaluate stochastic activations for generation. This strategy performs
reasonably well: it is only slightly inferior to the best deterministic
non-linearity, namely SILU combined with temperature scaling. This offers an
alternative to existing strategies by providing a controlled way to increase
the diversity of the generated text.

Motivation: 尽管深度神经网络在多个领域取得了经验成功，但我们对神经特征表示的理解仍不完整，因此需要从离散几何的角度来研究神经特征几何。

Method: 使用编码局部相似性结构的几何图来近似输入数据流形，通过理论分析和在20,000多个前馈神经网络上的实验，研究特征几何的演化。

Conclusion: 提出了基于几何的早停止启发式和网络深度选择准则，为神经网络设计提供了实用的几何指导原则。

Abstract: Deep neural networks learn feature representations via complex geometric
transformations of the input data manifold. Despite the models' empirical
success across domains, our understanding of neural feature representations is
still incomplete. In this work we investigate neural feature geometry through
the lens of discrete geometry. Since the input data manifold is typically
unobserved, we approximate it using geometric graphs that encode local
similarity structure. We provide theoretical results on the evolution of these
graphs during training, showing that nonlinear activations play a crucial role
in shaping feature geometry in feedforward neural networks. Moreover, we
discover that the geometric transformations resemble a discrete Ricci flow on
these graphs, suggesting that neural feature geometry evolves analogous to
Ricci flow. This connection is supported by experiments on over 20,000
feedforward neural networks trained on binary classification tasks across both
synthetic and real-world datasets. We observe that the emergence of class
separability corresponds to the emergence of community structure in the
associated graph representations, which is known to relate to discrete Ricci
flow dynamics. Building on these insights, we introduce a novel framework for
locally evaluating geometric transformations through comparison with discrete
Ricci flow dynamics. Our results suggest practical design principles, including
a geometry-informed early-stopping heuristic and a criterion for selecting
network depth.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本LLMs的思维链往往不忠实，但LALMs中的忠实性问题尚未被探索，而这对安全敏感应用至关重要。LALMs的推理更具挑战性，需要先从音频中提取线索再进行推理。

Method: 使用多种针对性干预方法：转述、填充词注入、提前回答和引入错误，在SAKURA和MMAR两个推理数据集上测试多个LALMs。

Result: 实验表明，LALMs生成的思维链总体上能忠实反映其底层决策过程。

Conclusion: 与文本LLMs不同，LALMs产生的思维链通常是忠实的，这对安全敏感应用具有重要意义。

Abstract: Faithfulness measures whether chain-of-thought (CoT) representations
accurately reflect a model's decision process and can be used as reliable
explanations. Prior work has shown that CoTs from text-based LLMs are often
unfaithful. This question has not been explored for large audio-language models
(LALMs), where faithfulness is critical for safety-sensitive applications.
Reasoning in LALMs is also more challenging, as models must first extract
relevant clues from audio before reasoning over them. In this paper, we
investigate the faithfulness of CoTs produced by several LALMs by applying
targeted interventions, including paraphrasing, filler token injection, early
answering, and introducing mistakes, on two challenging reasoning datasets:
SAKURA and MMAR. After going through the aforementioned interventions across
several datasets and tasks, our experiments suggest that, LALMs generally
produce CoTs that appear to be faithful to their underlying decision processes.

Motivation: 解决传统钓鱼检测器需要客户端在推理时绑定固定模态的问题，让任何客户端都能调用在其他地方训练的任何模态头，提高多模态钓鱼检测的可用性和灵活性。

Method: 在FedProx基础上提出角色感知桶聚合，受混合专家和FedMM启发，使用硬门控选择图像/HTML/URL专家，分别聚合模态特定参数以隔离跨嵌入冲突。

Result: 在TR-OP数据集上，融合头达到97.5%准确率和2.4%误报率；图像子集达到95.5%准确率和5.9%误报率；在WebPhish上获得96.5%准确率和1.8%误报率。

Conclusion: 桶聚合与硬门控专家相结合，能够在严格隐私保护下实现稳定的联邦训练，同时提高多模态钓鱼检测的可用性和灵活性。

Abstract: We present a federated, multi-modal phishing website detector that supports
URL, HTML, and IMAGE inputs without binding clients to a fixed modality at
inference: any client can invoke any modality head trained elsewhere.
Methodologically, we propose role-aware bucket aggregation on top of FedProx,
inspired by Mixture-of-Experts and FedMM. We drop learnable routing and use
hard gating (selecting the IMAGE/HTML/URL expert by sample modality), enabling
separate aggregation of modality-specific parameters to isolate cross-embedding
conflicts and stabilize convergence. On TR-OP, the Fusion head reaches Acc
97.5% with FPR 2.4% across two data types; on the image subset (ablation) it
attains Acc 95.5% with FPR 5.9%. For text, we use GraphCodeBERT for URLs and an
early three-way embedding for raw, noisy HTML. On WebPhish (HTML) we obtain Acc
96.5% / FPR 1.8%; on TR-OP (raw HTML) we obtain Acc 95.1% / FPR 4.6%. Results
indicate that bucket aggregation with hard-gated experts enables stable
federated training under strict privacy, while improving the usability and
flexibility of multi-modal phishing detection.

Abstract: Effective credit risk management is fundamental to financial decision-making,
necessitating robust models for default probability prediction and financial
entity classification. Traditional machine learning approaches face significant
challenges when confronted with high-dimensional data, limited
interpretability, rare event detection, and multi-class imbalance problems in
risk assessment. This research proposes a comprehensive meta-learning framework
that synthesizes multiple complementary models: supervised learning algorithms,
including XGBoost, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and Decision Tree;
unsupervised methods such as K-Nearest Neighbors; deep learning architectures
like Multilayer Perceptron; alongside LASSO regularization for feature
selection and dimensionality reduction; and Error-Correcting Output Codes as a
meta-classifier for handling imbalanced multi-class problems. We implement
Permutation Feature Importance analysis for each prediction class across all
constituent models to enhance model transparency. Our framework aims to
optimize predictive performance while providing a more holistic approach to
credit risk assessment. This research contributes to the development of more
accurate and reliable computational models for strategic financial decision
support by addressing three fundamental challenges in credit risk modeling. The
empirical validation of our approach involves an analysis of the Corporate
Credit Ratings dataset with credit ratings for 2,029 publicly listed US
companies. Results demonstrate that our meta-learning framework significantly
enhances the accuracy of financial entity classification regarding credit
rating migrations (upgrades and downgrades) and default probability estimation.

Conclusion: 使用基于损失函数的稀疏化技术相比随机方法可以获得更好的结果，在保持性能的同时有效降低可解释模型的复杂度。

Abstract: Deep neural networks are widely used in practical applications of AI,
however, their inner structure and complexity made them generally not easily
interpretable. Model transparency and interpretability are key requirements for
multiple scenarios where high performance is not enough to adopt the proposed
solution. In this work, a differentiable approximation of $L_0$ regularization
is adapted into a logic-based neural network, the Multi-layer Logical
Perceptron (MLLP), to study its efficacy in reducing the complexity of its
discrete interpretable version, the Concept Rule Set (CRS), while retaining its
performance. The results are compared to alternative heuristics like Random
Binarization of the network weights, to determine if better results can be
achieved when using a less-noisy technique that sparsifies the network based on
the loss function instead of a random distribution. The trade-off between the
CRS complexity and its performance is discussed.

Method: 两阶段训练：1）在32万手高注额专家决策上进行监督微调；2）在27万手求解器生成的手牌上进行强化学习。

Result: SpinGPT与求解器决策的容忍准确率达到78%；使用简单深筹码启发式方法，在3万手牌中对战Slumbot达到13.4±12.9 BB/100的表现（95%置信区间）。

Conclusion: LLM可能是处理多玩家不完全信息游戏（如扑克）的新方法，展示了在复杂游戏环境中的潜力。

Abstract: The Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR) algorithm and its variants have
enabled the development of pokerbots capable of beating the best human players
in heads-up (1v1) cash games and competing with them in six-player formats.
However, CFR's computational complexity rises exponentially with the number of
players. Furthermore, in games with three or more players, following Nash
equilibrium no longer guarantees a non-losing outcome. These limitations, along
with others, significantly restrict the applicability of CFR to the most
popular formats: tournaments. Motivated by the recent success of Large Language
Models (LLM) in chess and Diplomacy, we present SpinGPT, the first LLM tailored
to Spin & Go, a popular three-player online poker format. SpinGPT is trained in

(2) Reinforcement Learning on 270k solver-generated hands. Our results show
that SpinGPT matches the solver's actions in 78% of decisions (tolerant
accuracy). With a simple deep-stack heuristic, it achieves 13.4 +/- 12.9 BB/100
versus Slumbot in heads-up over 30,000 hands (95% CI). These results suggest

Motivation: 利率下降和经济稳定化提高了死亡率预测的重要性，特别是在保险和养老金市场。多步预测对公共卫生、人口规划和保险风险评估至关重要，但在数据有限时面临挑战。

Method: 使用混合系统结合统计和机器学习模型处理线性和非线性模式，评估了三种多步预测方法（递归、直接和多输入多输出）以及不同ML模型对12个数据集和21个模型的影响。

Result: 结果显示，多步预测方法和ML模型的选择对提高性能至关重要，ARIMA-LSTM混合模型在递归方法下在大多数情况下优于其他模型。

Conclusion: 混合系统结合统计和机器学习模型是处理死亡率预测中线性和非线性模式的有效方法，ARIMA-LSTM混合模型在递归方法下表现最佳。

Abstract: The decline in interest rates and economic stabilization has heightened the
importance of accurate mortality rate forecasting, particularly in insurance
and pension markets. Multi-step-ahead predictions are crucial for public
health, demographic planning, and insurance risk assessments; however, they
face challenges when data are limited. Hybrid systems that combine statistical
and Machine Learning (ML) models offer a promising solution for handling both
linear and nonlinear patterns. This study evaluated the impact of different
multi-step forecasting approaches (Recursive, Direct, and Multi-Input
Multi-Output) and ML models on the accuracy of hybrid systems. Results from 12
datasets and 21 models show that the selection of both the multi-step approach
and the ML model is essential for improving performance, with the ARIMA-LSTM
hybrid using a recursive approach outperforming other models in most cases.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MoveFM-R是一个融合移动基础模型和大型语言模型的新框架，通过语义增强位置编码、渐进式课程学习和交互式自反机制，解决地理坐标与语言token的词汇不匹配问题，显著提升移动轨迹生成的准确性和语义理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有移动基础模型在数据规模和语义理解上存在瓶颈，而大型语言模型虽然具备强大的语义推理能力，但缺乏对时空统计的固有理解，无法生成物理上合理的移动轨迹。

Method: 提出三个核心创新：语义增强位置编码来弥合地理与语言之间的差距；渐进式课程学习来对齐LLM的推理与移动模式；交互式自反机制用于条件轨迹生成。

Result: 大量实验表明，MoveFM-R显著优于现有的MFM基线和LLM基线，在零样本设置下表现出强大的泛化能力，并能从自然语言指令生成逼真的轨迹。

Conclusion: 通过将MFM的统计能力与LLM的深度语义理解相结合，MoveFM-R开创了一个新范式，实现了更全面、可解释和强大的人类移动建模。

Abstract: Mobility Foundation Models (MFMs) have advanced the modeling of human
movement patterns, yet they face a ceiling due to limitations in data scale and
semantic understanding. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer powerful
semantic reasoning, they lack the innate understanding of spatio-temporal
statistics required for generating physically plausible mobility trajectories.
To address these gaps, we propose MoveFM-R, a novel framework that unlocks the
full potential of mobility foundation models by leveraging language-driven
semantic reasoning capabilities. It tackles two key challenges: the vocabulary
mismatch between continuous geographic coordinates and discrete language
tokens, and the representation gap between the latent vectors of MFMs and the
semantic world of LLMs. MoveFM-R is built on three core innovations: a
semantically enhanced location encoding to bridge the geography-language gap, a
progressive curriculum to align the LLM's reasoning with mobility patterns, and
an interactive self-reflection mechanism for conditional trajectory generation.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that MoveFM-R significantly outperforms
existing MFM-based and LLM-based baselines. It also shows robust generalization
in zero-shot settings and excels at generating realistic trajectories from
natural language instructions. By synthesizing the statistical power of MFMs
with the deep semantic understanding of LLMs, MoveFM-R pioneers a new paradigm
that enables a more comprehensive, interpretable, and powerful modeling of
human mobility. The implementation of MoveFM-R is available online at
https://anonymous.4open.science/r/MoveFM-R-CDE7/.

Abstract: The lattice Boltzmann equation (LBE), rooted in kinetic theory, provides a
powerful framework for capturing complex flow behaviour by describing the
evolution of single-particle distribution functions (PDFs). Despite its
success, solving the LBE numerically remains computationally intensive due to
strict time-step restrictions imposed by collision kernels. Here, we introduce
a physics-informed neural operator framework for the LBE that enables
prediction over large time horizons without step-by-step integration,
effectively bypassing the need to explicitly solve the collision kernel. We
incorporate intrinsic moment-matching constraints of the LBE, along with global
equivariance of the full distribution field, enabling the model to capture the
complex dynamics of the underlying kinetic system. Our framework is
discretization-invariant, enabling models trained on coarse lattices to
generalise to finer ones (kinetic super-resolution). In addition, it is
agnostic to the specific form of the underlying collision model, which makes it
naturally applicable across different kinetic datasets regardless of the
governing dynamics. Our results demonstrate robustness across complex flow
scenarios, including von Karman vortex shedding, ligament breakup, and bubble
adhesion. This establishes a new data-driven pathway for modelling kinetic
systems.

Conclusion: 图提示学习应该专注于释放预训练模型的能力，而让分类器适应下游场景，UniPrompt方法为此提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Graph Prompt Learning (GPL) has emerged as a promising paradigm that bridges
graph pretraining models and downstream scenarios, mitigating label dependency
and the misalignment between upstream pretraining and downstream tasks.
Although existing GPL studies explore various prompt strategies, their
effectiveness and underlying principles remain unclear. We identify two
critical limitations: (1) Lack of consensus on underlying mechanisms: Despite
current GPLs have advanced the field, there is no consensus on how prompts
interact with pretrained models, as different strategies intervene at varying
spaces within the model, i.e., input-level, layer-wise, and
representation-level prompts. (2) Limited scenario adaptability: Most methods
fail to generalize across diverse downstream scenarios, especially under data
distribution shifts (e.g., homophilic-to-heterophilic graphs). To address these
issues, we theoretically analyze existing GPL approaches and reveal that
representation-level prompts essentially function as fine-tuning a simple
downstream classifier, proposing that graph prompt learning should focus on
unleashing the capability of pretrained models, and the classifier adapts to
downstream scenarios. Based on our findings, we propose UniPrompt, a novel GPL
method that adapts any pretrained models, unleashing the capability of
pretrained models while preserving the structure of the input graph. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method can effectively integrate with various
pretrained models and achieve strong performance across in-domain and
cross-domain scenarios.

TL;DR: 提出了一种内存和计算效率高的低通信分布式训练方法，通过限制反向传播只更新部分参数来减少峰值内存使用和训练FLOPs，同时保持模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通过减少全局同步频率来降低通信开销，但效率和内存使用仍有改进空间。

Method: 在本地更新步骤中，每个节点只更新固定的参数子集，其余参数保持冻结，同时保持完整前向传播以避免跨节点激活交换。

Result: 在32个节点上训练13亿参数语言模型的实验表明，该方法在相同token和带宽预算下达到了先前低通信方法的困惑度，同时减少了训练FLOPs和峰值内存。

Conclusion: 该方法通过限制参数更新范围实现了内存和计算效率的提升，同时保持了模型性能。

Abstract: We introduce a memory- and compute-efficient method for low-communication
distributed training. Existing methods reduce communication by performing
multiple local updates between infrequent global synchronizations. We
demonstrate that their efficiency can be significantly improved by restricting
backpropagation: instead of updating all the parameters, each node updates only
a fixed subset while keeping the remainder frozen during local steps. This
constraint substantially reduces peak memory usage and training FLOPs, while a
full forward pass over all parameters eliminates the need for cross-node
activation exchange. Experiments on a $1.3$B-parameter language model trained
across $32$ nodes show that our method matches the perplexity of prior
low-communication approaches under identical token and bandwidth budgets while
reducing training FLOPs and peak memory.

TL;DR: 该研究解决了博弈学习中时间延迟反馈的问题，提出了加权乐观跟随正则化领导者算法(WOFTRL)，通过调整乐观权重来抵消时间延迟的影响，在乐观权重超过时间延迟时能实现常数遗憾和策略收敛。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 博弈学习中多个智能体独立学习策略会产生优化差异，通常使用OFTRL算法通过预测未来奖励来解决这个问题，但过去奖励的观察时间延迟会阻碍预测效果。

Method: 提出了加权OFTRL算法(WOFTRL)，其中OFTRL中下一个奖励的预测向量被加权n倍，利用乐观权重来抵消时间延迟的影响。

Result: 证明当乐观权重超过时间延迟时，WOFTRL在一般和正规形式博弈中能实现常数遗憾(O(1)-regret)，在多矩阵零和博弈中策略能收敛到纳什均衡(最佳迭代收敛)。

Conclusion: WOFTRL通过调整乐观权重有效解决了博弈学习中的时间延迟问题，理论结果得到了实验验证和支持。

Abstract: This study raises and addresses the problem of time-delayed feedback in
learning in games. Because learning in games assumes that multiple agents
independently learn their strategies, a discrepancy in optimization often
emerges among the agents. To overcome this discrepancy, the prediction of the
future reward is incorporated into algorithms, typically known as Optimistic
Follow-the-Regularized-Leader (OFTRL). However, the time delay in observing the
past rewards hinders the prediction. Indeed, this study firstly proves that
even a single-step delay worsens the performance of OFTRL from the aspects of
regret and convergence. This study proposes the weighted OFTRL (WOFTRL), where
the prediction vector of the next reward in OFTRL is weighted $n$ times. We
further capture an intuition that the optimistic weight cancels out this time
delay. We prove that when the optimistic weight exceeds the time delay, our
WOFTRL recovers the good performances that the regret is constant
($O(1)$-regret) in general-sum normal-form games, and the strategies converge
to the Nash equilibrium as a subsequence (best-iterate convergence) in
poly-matrix zero-sum games. The theoretical results are supported and
strengthened by our experiments.

Motivation: 现有持久同调计算方法在处理大规模点云数据时面临计算复杂度高的问题，特别是Vietoris-Rips complex的指数增长限制了其应用范围。

Method: 引入Flood complex，基于Delaunay三角剖分和小点子集，通过'淹没'过程构建复形，支持GPU并行化。

Conclusion: Flood complex为大规模点云数据的拓扑分析提供了可扩展的解决方案，特别适用于几何或拓扑复杂的对象。

Abstract: We consider the problem of computing persistent homology (PH) for large-scale
Euclidean point cloud data, aimed at downstream machine learning tasks, where
the exponential growth of the most widely-used Vietoris-Rips complex imposes
serious computational limitations. Although more scalable alternatives such as
the Alpha complex or sparse Rips approximations exist, they often still result
in a prohibitively large number of simplices. This poses challenges in the
complex construction and in the subsequent PH computation, prohibiting their
use on large-scale point clouds. To mitigate these issues, we introduce the
Flood complex, inspired by the advantages of the Alpha and Witness complex
constructions. Informally, at a given filtration value $r\geq 0$, the Flood
complex contains all simplices from a Delaunay triangulation of a small subset
of the point cloud $X$ that are fully covered by balls of radius $r$ emanating
from $X$, a process we call flooding. Our construction allows for efficient PH
computation, possesses several desirable theoretical properties, and is
amenable to GPU parallelization. Scaling experiments on 3D point cloud data
show that we can compute PH of up to dimension 2 on several millions of points.
Importantly, when evaluating object classification performance on real-world
and synthetic data, we provide evidence that this scaling capability is needed,
especially if objects are geometrically or topologically complex, yielding
performance superior to other PH-based methods and neural networks for point
cloud data.

Abstract: Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) have been successful in various
applications due to their continuous nature and parameter-sharing efficiency.
However, these unique characteristics also introduce challenges in training,
particularly with respect to gradient computation accuracy and convergence
analysis. In this paper, we address these challenges by investigating the
impact of activation functions. We demonstrate that the properties of
activation functions, specifically smoothness and nonlinearity, are critical to
the training dynamics. Smooth activation functions guarantee globally unique
solutions for both forward and backward ODEs, while sufficient nonlinearity is
essential for maintaining the spectral properties of the Neural Tangent Kernel
(NTK) during training. Together, these properties enable us to establish the
global convergence of Neural ODEs under gradient descent in overparameterized
regimes. Our theoretical findings are validated by numerical experiments, which
not only support our analysis but also provide practical guidelines for scaling
Neural ODEs, potentially leading to faster training and improved performance in
real-world applications.

Result: 变分目标能在算法任务中选择低复杂度解并实现强泛化，但标准优化器无法从随机初始化找到此类解，揭示了关键优化挑战。

Conclusion: 通过提供具有强渐近保证的描述长度目标的理论框架，为训练实现更好压缩和泛化的神经网络指明了潜在路径。

Abstract: The Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle offers a formal framework for
applying Occam's razor in machine learning. However, its application to neural
networks such as Transformers is challenging due to the lack of a principled,
universal measure for model complexity. This paper introduces the theoretical
notion of asymptotically optimal description length objectives, grounded in the
theory of Kolmogorov complexity. We establish that a minimizer of such an
objective achieves optimal compression, for any dataset, up to an additive
constant, in the limit as model resource bounds increase. We prove that
asymptotically optimal objectives exist for Transformers, building on a new
demonstration of their computational universality. We further show that such
objectives can be tractable and differentiable by constructing and analyzing a
variational objective based on an adaptive Gaussian mixture prior. Our
empirical analysis shows that this variational objective selects for a
low-complexity solution with strong generalization on an algorithmic task, but
standard optimizers fail to find such solutions from a random initialization,
highlighting key optimization challenges. More broadly, by providing a
theoretical framework for identifying description length objectives with strong
asymptotic guarantees, we outline a potential path towards training neural
networks that achieve greater compression and generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 静电生成模型（如PFGM++）在图像合成中表现出色，但依赖昂贵的ODE模拟生成样本，计算成本高。需要开发有效的蒸馏方法来加速生成过程。

Method: IPFM将蒸馏重新表述为逆问题：学习一个生成器，使其诱导的静电场与教师模型匹配。推导出可处理的训练目标，当D→∞时恢复为SiD方法。

Result: IPFM生成的蒸馏模型仅需少量函数评估即可达到接近甚至优于教师模型的样本质量。有限D值的蒸馏收敛速度比扩散模型（D→∞）更快。

Conclusion: IPFM是有效的静电生成模型蒸馏框架，有限D值的PFGM++模型具有更优的优化和采样特性，蒸馏收敛更快。

Abstract: Electrostatic generative models such as PFGM++ have recently emerged as a
powerful framework, achieving state-of-the-art performance in image synthesis.
PFGM++ operates in an extended data space with auxiliary dimensionality $D$,
recovering the diffusion model framework as $D\to\infty$, while yielding
superior empirical results for finite $D$. Like diffusion models, PFGM++ relies
on expensive ODE simulations to generate samples, making it computationally
costly. To address this, we propose Inverse Poisson Flow Matching (IPFM), a
novel distillation framework that accelerates electrostatic generative models
across all values of $D$. Our IPFM reformulates distillation as an inverse
problem: learning a generator whose induced electrostatic field matches that of
the teacher. We derive a tractable training objective for this problem and show
that, as $D \to \infty$, our IPFM closely recovers Score Identity Distillation
(SiD), a recent method for distilling diffusion models. Empirically, our IPFM
produces distilled generators that achieve near-teacher or even superior sample
quality using only a few function evaluations. Moreover, we observe that
distillation converges faster for finite $D$ than in the $D \to \infty$
(diffusion) limit, which is consistent with prior findings that finite-$D$
PFGM++ models exhibit more favorable optimization and sampling properties.

Motivation: 现有物理信息图神经网络(PIGNNs)在精度和推理效率方面仍有改进空间，特别是在推理时物理损失无法发挥作用，这阻碍了其在电力系统运行中的实际应用。

Method: 提出PIGNN-Attn-LS方法：1）使用边感知注意力机制，通过每边偏置显式编码线路物理特性，捕捉电网的各向异性；2）结合基于回溯线搜索的全局化校正算子，在推理时恢复有效的下降准则。

Conclusion: PIGNN-Attn-LS通过结合注意力机制和全局化校正，显著提升了物理信息图神经网络在AC潮流计算中的精度和效率，为电力系统运行提供了可靠的快速求解器。

Abstract: Physics-informed graph neural networks (PIGNNs) have emerged as fast AC
power-flow solvers that can replace classic Newton--Raphson (NR) solvers,
especially when thousands of scenarios must be evaluated. However, current
PIGNNs still need accuracy improvements at parity speed; in particular, the
physics loss is inoperative at inference, which can deter operational adoption.
We address this with PIGNN-Attn-LS, combining an edge-aware attention mechanism
that explicitly encodes line physics via per-edge biases, capturing the grid's
anisotropy, with a backtracking line-search-based globalized correction
operator that restores an operative decrease criterion at inference. Training
and testing use a realistic High-/Medium-Voltage scenario generator, with NR
used only to construct reference states. On held-out HV cases consisting of
4--32-bus grids, PIGNN-Attn-LS achieves a test RMSE of 0.00033 p.u. in voltage
and 0.08$^\circ$ in angle, outperforming the PIGNN-MLP baseline by 99.5\% and
87.1\%, respectively. With streaming micro-batches, it delivers 2--5$\times$
faster batched inference than NR on 4--1024-bus grids.

Conclusion: 降维公式化方法能有效提升神经网络相关优化问题的求解效率，特别适合GPU加速计算。

Abstract: We propose a reduced-space formulation for optimizing over trained neural
networks where the network's outputs and derivatives are evaluated on a GPU. To
do this, we treat the neural network as a "gray box" where intermediate
variables and constraints are not exposed to the optimization solver. Compared
to the full-space formulation, in which intermediate variables and constraints
are exposed to the optimization solver, the reduced-space formulation leads to
faster solves and fewer iterations in an interior point method. We demonstrate
the benefits of this method on two optimization problems: Adversarial
generation for a classifier trained on MNIST images and security-constrained
optimal power flow with transient feasibility enforced using a neural network
surrogate.

Abstract: High-order numerical methods enhance Transformer performance in tasks like
NLP and CV, but introduce a performance-efficiency trade-off due to increased
computational overhead. Our analysis reveals that conventional efficiency
techniques, such as distillation, can be detrimental to the performance of
these models, exemplified by PCformer. To explore more optimizable ODE-based
Transformer architectures, we propose the \textbf{I}terative \textbf{I}mplicit
\textbf{E}uler \textbf{T}ransformer \textbf{(IIET)}, which simplifies
high-order methods using an iterative implicit Euler approach. This
simplification not only leads to superior performance but also facilitates
model compression compared to PCformer. To enhance inference efficiency, we
introduce \textbf{I}teration \textbf{I}nfluence-\textbf{A}ware
\textbf{D}istillation \textbf{(IIAD)}. Through a flexible threshold, IIAD
allows users to effectively balance the performance-efficiency trade-off. On
lm-evaluation-harness, IIET boosts average accuracy by 2.65\% over vanilla

self-supervised pretraining on molecular graphs has shown promise, many
existing approaches either depend on hand-crafted augmentations or complex
generative objectives, and often rely solely on 2D topology, leaving valuable
3D structural information underutilized. To address this gap, we introduce
C-FREE (Contrast-Free Representation learning on Ego-nets), a simple framework
that integrates 2D graphs with ensembles of 3D conformers. C-FREE learns
molecular representations by predicting subgraph embeddings from their
complementary neighborhoods in the latent space, using fixed-radius ego-nets as
modeling units across different conformers. This design allows us to integrate
both geometric and topological information within a hybrid Graph Neural Network
(GNN)-Transformer backbone, without negatives, positional encodings, or
expensive pre-processing. Pretraining on the GEOM dataset, which provides rich
3D conformational diversity, C-FREE achieves state-of-the-art results on
MoleculeNet, surpassing contrastive, generative, and other multimodal
self-supervised methods. Fine-tuning across datasets with diverse sizes and
molecule types further demonstrates that pretraining transfers effectively to
new chemical domains, highlighting the importance of 3D-informed molecular
representations.

Motivation: Koopman算子作为非线性动力系统的线性表示，在多个科学领域受到关注。最近它与再生核希尔伯特空间结合，但面临计算复杂度高和超参数优化困难的问题。

Method: 将高斯过程回归与动态模态分解统一起来，通过高斯过程方法减轻核基Koopman算法的计算负担，并提高对传感器噪声的鲁棒性。

Result: 该方法不仅降低了计算需求，还展示了对传感器噪声更强的抵抗能力，同时改进了超参数优化和字典学习过程。

Conclusion: 高斯过程回归与动态模态分解的统一为Koopman算子理论提供了更高效和鲁棒的实现方法，解决了核方法中的关键挑战。

Abstract: The Koopman operator, as a linear representation of a nonlinear dynamical
system, has been attracting attention in many fields of science. Recently,
Koopman operator theory has been combined with another concept that is popular
in data science: reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. We follow this thread into
Gaussian process methods, and illustrate how these methods can alleviate two
pervasive problems with kernel-based Koopman algorithms. The first being
sparsity: most kernel methods do not scale well and require an approximation to
become practical. We show that not only can the computational demands be
reduced, but also demonstrate improved resilience against sensor noise. The
second problem involves hyperparameter optimization and dictionary learning to
adapt the model to the dynamical system. In summary, the main contribution of
this work is the unification of Gaussian process regression and dynamic mode
decomposition.

TL;DR: 提出了OFMU，一种基于惩罚的双层优化框架，用于解决大语言模型中的机器遗忘问题，通过分层结构优先处理遗忘目标同时保持模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在敏感应用中需要能够遗忘特定知识（如用户请求、版权材料、过时信息），以满足监管合规、用户隐私和安全要求，而无需从头重新训练。

Method: 采用惩罚性双层优化框架，内层最大化步骤通过相似性感知惩罚强制遗忘，外层最小化步骤恢复模型效用，并开发了具有收敛保证的两循环算法。

Result: 在视觉和语言基准测试中的广泛实验表明，OFMU在遗忘效果和保留效用方面始终优于现有的遗忘方法。

Conclusion: OFMU方法在遗忘效果和模型效用之间实现了更好的权衡，为机器遗忘提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models deployed in sensitive applications increasingly require
the ability to unlearn specific knowledge, such as user requests, copyrighted
materials, or outdated information, without retraining from scratch to ensure
regulatory compliance, user privacy, and safety. This task, known as machine
unlearning, aims to remove the influence of targeted data (forgetting) while
maintaining performance on the remaining data (retention). A common approach is
to formulate this as a multi-objective problem and reduce it to a
single-objective problem via scalarization, where forgetting and retention
losses are combined using a weighted sum. However, this often results in
unstable training dynamics and degraded model utility due to conflicting
gradient directions. To address these challenges, we propose OFMU, a
penalty-based bi-level optimization framework that explicitly prioritizes
forgetting while preserving retention through a hierarchical structure. Our
method enforces forgetting via an inner maximization step that incorporates a
similarity-aware penalty to decorrelate the gradients of the forget and
retention objectives, and restores utility through an outer minimization step.
To ensure scalability, we develop a two-loop algorithm with provable
convergence guarantees under both convex and non-convex regimes. We further
provide a rigorous theoretical analysis of convergence rates and show that our
approach achieves better trade-offs between forgetting efficacy and model
utility compared to prior methods. Extensive experiments across vision and
language benchmarks demonstrate that OFMU consistently outperforms existing
unlearning methods in both forgetting efficacy and retained utility.

Abstract: We present a machine learning pipeline for biomarker discovery in Multiple
Sclerosis (MS), integrating eight publicly available microarray datasets from
Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMC). After robust preprocessing we
trained an XGBoost classifier optimized via Bayesian search. SHapley Additive
exPlanations (SHAP) were used to identify key features for model prediction,
indicating thus possible biomarkers. These were compared with genes identified
through classical Differential Expression Analysis (DEA). Our comparison
revealed both overlapping and unique biomarkers between SHAP and DEA,
suggesting complementary strengths. Enrichment analysis confirmed the
biological relevance of SHAP-selected genes, linking them to pathways such as
sphingolipid signaling, Th1/Th2/Th17 cell differentiation, and Epstein-Barr
virus infection all known to be associated with MS. This study highlights the
value of combining explainable AI (xAI) with traditional statistical methods to
gain deeper insights into disease mechanism.

Abstract: Constrained optimization is a powerful framework for enforcing requirements
on neural networks. These constrained deep learning problems are typically
solved using first-order methods on their min-max Lagrangian formulation, but
such approaches often suffer from oscillations and can fail to find all local
solutions. While the Augmented Lagrangian method (ALM) addresses these issues,
practitioners often favor dual optimistic ascent schemes (PI control) on the
standard Lagrangian, which perform well empirically but lack formal guarantees.
In this paper, we establish a previously unknown equivalence between these
approaches: dual optimistic ascent on the Lagrangian is equivalent to gradient
descent-ascent on the Augmented Lagrangian. This finding allows us to transfer
the robust theoretical guarantees of the ALM to the dual optimistic setting,
proving it converges linearly to all local solutions. Furthermore, the
equivalence provides principled guidance for tuning the optimism
hyper-parameter. Our work closes a critical gap between the empirical success
of dual optimistic methods and their theoretical foundation.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising decentralized learning
(DL) approach that enables the use of distributed data without compromising
user privacy. However, FL poses several key challenges. First, it is frequently
assumed that every client can train the same machine learning models, however,
not all clients are able to meet this assumption because of differences in
their business needs and computational resources. Second, statistical
heterogeneity (a.k.a. non-IID data) poses a major challenge in FL, which can
lead to lower global model performance. Third, while addressing these
challenges, there is a need for a cost-effective incentive mechanism to
encourage clients to participate in FL training. In response to these
challenges, we propose several methodologies: DL-SH, which facilitates
efficient, privacy-preserving, and communication-efficient learning in the
context of statistical heterogeneity; DL-MH, designed to manage fully
heterogeneous models while tackling statistical disparities; and I-DL-MH, an
incentive-based extension of DL-MH that promotes client engagement in federated
learning training by providing incentives within this complex federated
learning framework. Comprehensive experiments were carried out to assess the
performance and scalability of the proposed approaches across a range of
complex experimental settings. This involved utilizing various model
architectures, in diverse data distributions, including IID and several non-IID
scenarios, as well as multiple datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that
the proposed approaches significantly enhance accuracy and decrease
communication costs while effectively addressing statistical heterogeneity and
model heterogeneity in comparison to existing state-of-the-art approaches and
baselines, with DL-SH improving global model accuracy by 153%, and I-DL-MH
achieving a 225% improvement under non-IID conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成模型通常将连续数据和离散事件作为独立过程处理，这造成了建模复杂系统中两者同步交互的差距。

Method: 提出JointDiff扩散框架，通过CrossGuid条件操作实现多智能体领域的有效条件控制，支持弱控球者引导和文本引导两种可控生成场景。

Result: 在足球和美式足球数据集上实现了最先进的性能，证明了联合建模对于构建真实可控的交互系统生成模型至关重要。

Conclusion: 联合建模是构建现实且可控的交互系统生成模型的关键要素。

Abstract: Generative models often treat continuous data and discrete events as separate
processes, creating a gap in modeling complex systems where they interact
synchronously. To bridge this gap, we introduce JointDiff, a novel diffusion
framework designed to unify these two processes by simultaneously generating
continuous spatio-temporal data and synchronous discrete events. We demonstrate
its efficacy in the sports domain by simultaneously modeling multi-agent
trajectories and key possession events. This joint modeling is validated with
non-controllable generation and two novel controllable generation scenarios:
weak-possessor-guidance, which offers flexible semantic control over game
dynamics through a simple list of intended ball possessors, and text-guidance,
which enables fine-grained, language-driven generation. To enable the
conditioning with these guidance signals, we introduce CrossGuid, an effective
conditioning operation for multi-agent domains. We also share a new unified
sports benchmark enhanced with textual descriptions for soccer and football
datasets. JointDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating that
joint modeling is crucial for building realistic and controllable generative
models for interactive systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大型EEG模型主要关注编码器架构，缺乏同等能力的解码器，限制了学习特征的充分利用。需要开发能够有效泛化到不同任务和数据集的新范式。

Method: ECHO将EEG建模重新定义为序列到序列学习，在序列空间中捕捉信号、标签和任务之间的层次关系，并整合离散支持样本构建上下文线索，实现上下文学习能力。

Result: 在多个数据集上的广泛实验表明，即使使用基本模型组件，ECHO在多任务设置中始终优于最先进的单任务LEM，展现出优异的泛化能力和适应性。

Conclusion: ECHO通过解码器中心的序列到序列学习范式，成功解决了现有EEG模型解码能力不足的问题，实现了无需参数更新的动态任务适应和优异的跨任务泛化性能。

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG), with its broad range of applications,
necessitates models that can generalize effectively across various tasks and
datasets. Large EEG Models (LEMs) address this by pretraining encoder-centric
architectures on large-scale unlabeled data to extract universal
representations. While effective, these models lack decoders of comparable
capacity, limiting the full utilization of the learned features. To address
this issue, we introduce ECHO, a novel decoder-centric LEM paradigm that
reformulates EEG modeling as sequence-to-sequence learning. ECHO captures
layered relationships among signals, labels, and tasks within sequence space,
while incorporating discrete support samples to construct contextual cues. This
design equips ECHO with in-context learning, enabling dynamic adaptation to
heterogeneous tasks without parameter updates. Extensive experiments across
multiple datasets demonstrate that, even with basic model components, ECHO
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art single-task LEMs in multi-task
settings, showing superior generalization and adaptability.

Abstract: Bundle pricing refers to designing several product combinations (i.e.,
bundles) and determining their prices in order to maximize the expected profit.
It is a classic problem in revenue management and arises in many industries,
such as e-commerce, tourism, and video games. However, the problem is typically
intractable due to the exponential number of candidate bundles. In this paper,
we explore the usage of graph convolutional networks (GCNs) in solving the
bundle pricing problem. Specifically, we first develop a graph representation
of the mixed bundling model (where every possible bundle is assigned with a
specific price) and then train a GCN to learn the latent patterns of optimal
bundles. Based on the trained GCN, we propose two inference strategies to
derive high-quality feasible solutions. A local-search technique is further
proposed to improve the solution quality. Numerical experiments validate the
effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed GCN-based framework. Using a GCN
trained on instances with 5 products, our methods consistently achieve
near-optimal solutions (better than 97%) with only a fraction of computational
time for problems of small to medium size. It also achieves superior solutions
for larger size of problems compared with other heuristic methods such as
bundle size pricing (BSP). The method can also provide high quality solutions
for instances with more than 30 products even for the challenging cases where
product utilities are non-additive.

TL;DR: 本文研究发现激活函数选择是缓解持续学习中可塑性损失的关键因素，提出了两种新的非线性激活函数（Smooth-Leaky和Randomized Smooth-Leaky），在监督学习和强化学习的持续学习场景中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在持续学习中，模型不仅面临灾难性遗忘问题，还会逐渐丧失适应能力（可塑性损失），而激活函数在这一失效模式中的作用尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 基于对负分支形状和饱和行为的特性分析，提出了两种即插即用的非线性激活函数，并在监督类增量学习和非平稳强化学习环境中进行评估，同时提供了简单的压力测试协议和诊断方法。

Result: 研究表明，精心设计的激活函数能够在持续学习中维持模型的可塑性，无需额外的容量或任务特定调优。

Conclusion: 激活函数设计提供了一种轻量级、领域通用的方法来在持续学习中维持可塑性，是缓解可塑性损失的关键因素。

Abstract: In independent, identically distributed (i.i.d.) training regimes, activation
functions have been benchmarked extensively, and their differences often shrink
once model size and optimization are tuned. In continual learning, however, the
picture is different: beyond catastrophic forgetting, models can progressively
lose the ability to adapt (referred to as loss of plasticity) and the role of
the non-linearity in this failure mode remains underexplored. We show that
activation choice is a primary, architecture-agnostic lever for mitigating
plasticity loss. Building on a property-level analysis of negative-branch shape
and saturation behavior, we introduce two drop-in nonlinearities (Smooth-Leaky
and Randomized Smooth-Leaky) and evaluate them in two complementary settings:
(i) supervised class-incremental benchmarks and (ii) reinforcement learning
with non-stationary MuJoCo environments designed to induce controlled
distribution and dynamics shifts. We also provide a simple stress protocol and
diagnostics that link the shape of the activation to the adaptation under
change. The takeaway is straightforward: thoughtful activation design offers a
lightweight, domain-general way to sustain plasticity in continual learning
without extra capacity or task-specific tuning.

Conclusion: 学习到的流形使得在潜在空间中进行策略梯度成为可能，实现了任务特定的适应，提高了样本效率。

Abstract: Despite its recent successes, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is
notoriously sample-inefficient. We argue that this inefficiency stems from the
standard practice of optimizing policies directly in the high-dimensional and
highly redundant parameter space $\Theta$. This challenge is greatly compounded
in multi-task settings. In this work, we develop a novel, unsupervised approach
that compresses the policy parameter space $\Theta$ into a low-dimensional
latent space $\mathcal{Z}$. We train a generative model
$g:\mathcal{Z}\to\Theta$ by optimizing a behavioral reconstruction loss, which
ensures that the latent space is organized by functional similarity rather than
proximity in parameterization. We conjecture that the inherent dimensionality
of this manifold is a function of the environment's complexity, rather than the
size of the policy network. We validate our approach in continuous control
domains, showing that the parameterization of standard policy networks can be
compressed up to five orders of magnitude while retaining most of its
expressivity. As a byproduct, we show that the learned manifold enables
task-specific adaptation via Policy Gradient operating in the latent space
$\mathcal{Z}$.

Abstract: The northeastern region of the Czech Republic is among the most seismically
active areas in the country. The most frequent seismic events are
mining-induced since there used to be strong mining activity in the past.
However, natural tectonic events may also occur. In addition, seismic stations
often record explosions in quarries in the region. Despite the cessation of
mining activities, mine-induced seismic events still occur. Therefore, a rapid
differentiation between tectonic and anthropogenic events is still important.
  The region is currently monitored by the OKC seismic station in
Ostrava-Kr\'{a}sn\'{e} Pole built in 1983 which is a part of the Czech Regional
Seismic Network. The station has been providing digital continuous waveform
data at 100 Hz since 2007. In the years 1992--2002, the region was co-monitored
by the Seismic Polygon Fren\v{s}t\'{a}t (SPF) which consisted of five seismic
stations using a triggered STA/LTA system.
  In this study, we apply and compare machine learning methods to the SPF
dataset, which contains labeled records of tectonic and mining-induced events.
For binary classification, a Long Short-Term Memory recurrent neural network
and XGBoost achieved an F1-score of 0.94 -- 0.95, demonstrating the potential
of modern machine learning techniques for rapid event characterization.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is the dominant paradigm for sharpening strategic
tool use capabilities of LLMs on long-horizon, sparsely-rewarded agent tasks,
yet it faces a fundamental challenge of exploration-exploitation trade-off.
Existing studies stimulate exploration through the lens of policy entropy, but
such mechanical entropy maximization is prone to RL training instability due to
the multi-turn distribution shifting. In this paper, we target the progressive
exploration-exploitation balance under the guidance of the agent own
experiences without succumbing to either entropy collapsing or runaway
divergence. We propose SPEAR, a curriculum-based self-imitation learning (SIL)
recipe for training agentic LLMs. It extends the vanilla SIL framework, where a
replay buffer stores self-generated promising trajectories for off-policy
update, by gradually steering the policy evolution within a well-balanced range
of entropy across stages. Specifically, our approach incorporates a curriculum
to manage the exploration process, utilizing intrinsic rewards to foster
skill-level exploration and facilitating action-level exploration through SIL.
At first, the auxiliary tool call reward plays a critical role in the
accumulation of tool-use skills, enabling broad exposure to the unfamiliar
distributions of the environment feedback with an upward entropy trend. As
training progresses, self-imitation gets strengthened to exploit existing
successful patterns from replayed experiences for comparative action-level
exploration, accelerating solution iteration without unbounded entropy growth.
To further stabilize training, we recalibrate the advantages of experiences in
the replay buffer to address the potential policy drift. Reugularizations such
as the clipping of tokens with high covariance between probability and
advantage are introduced to the trajectory-level entropy control to curb
over-confidence.

Abstract: Training LLM agents in multi-turn environments with sparse rewards, where
completing a single task requires 30+ turns of interaction within an episode,
presents a fundamental challenge for reinforcement learning. We identify a
critical failure mode unique to this setting: the exploration-exploitation
cascade failure. This cascade begins with early-stage policy premature
convergence, where sparse feedback causes agents to commit to flawed,
low-entropy strategies. Subsequently, agents enter late-stage policy collapse,
where conventional entropy regularization becomes counterproductive, promoting
chaotic exploration that destabilizes training. We propose Entropy-regularized
Policy Optimization (EPO), a general framework that breaks this failure cycle
through three synergistic mechanisms: (1) adopting entropy regularization in
multi-turn settings to enhance exploration, (2) an entropy smoothing
regularizer that bounds policy entropy within historical averages to prevent
abrupt fluctuations, and (3) adaptive phase-based weighting that balances
exploration and exploitation across training. Our analysis justifies that EPO
guarantees monotonically decreasing entropy variance while maintaining
convergence. EPO achieves up to 152% performance improvement on ScienceWorld
and up to 19.8% on ALFWorld. Our work demonstrates that multi-turn
sparse-reward settings require fundamentally different entropy control than
traditional RL, with broad implications for LLM agent training.

TL;DR: 论文提出EDGE评估协议，通过识别极端类别序列来更准确地评估类增量学习的性能分布，解决了传统采样方法低估性能方差的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CIL评估协议仅从少量随机序列中计算均值和方差，无法捕捉完整的性能分布范围，导致均值估计偏差和方差严重低估。

Method: 提出EDGE评估协议，基于任务间相似性与模型性能的正相关性，自适应识别和采样极端类别序列，以逼近真实性能分布。

Result: 实验表明EDGE能有效捕捉性能极值，提供更准确分布边界估计，为模型选择和鲁棒性检查提供可行见解。

Conclusion: EDGE通过极端序列评估提供了更可靠的CIL评估方法，能更好地表征模型在多样化类别序列下的真实性能分布。

Abstract: Class Incremental Learning (CIL) requires models to continuously learn new
classes without forgetting previously learned ones, while maintaining stable
performance across all possible class sequences. In real-world settings, the
order in which classes arrive is diverse and unpredictable, and model
performance can vary substantially across different sequences. Yet mainstream
evaluation protocols calculate mean and variance from only a small set of
randomly sampled sequences. Our theoretical analysis and empirical results
demonstrate that this sampling strategy fails to capture the full performance
range, resulting in biased mean estimates and a severe underestimation of the
true variance in the performance distribution. We therefore contend that a
robust CIL evaluation protocol should accurately characterize and estimate the
entire performance distribution. To this end, we introduce the concept of
extreme sequences and provide theoretical justification for their crucial role
in the reliable evaluation of CIL. Moreover, we observe a consistent positive
correlation between inter-task similarity and model performance, a relation
that can be leveraged to guide the search for extreme sequences. Building on
these insights, we propose EDGE (Extreme case-based Distribution and
Generalization Evaluation), an evaluation protocol that adaptively identifies
and samples extreme class sequences using inter-task similarity, offering a
closer approximation of the ground-truth performance distribution. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that EDGE effectively captures performance extremes and
yields more accurate estimates of distributional boundaries, providing
actionable insights for model selection and robustness checking. Our code is

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合最优传输采样策略的Mean Flow框架，用于改进单步生成模型，使其更好地保持多步流匹配过程的保真度和多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 流匹配生成模型虽然在各领域取得优异成果，但存在推理速度慢的问题。Mean Flow提供单步生成方法但无法忠实近似原始多步过程的行为，需要解决这一局限性。

Method: 将最优传输采样策略整合到Mean Flow框架中，开发能够更好保持原始多步流过程保真度和多样性的单步生成器。

Result: 在低维控制设置和高维任务（图像生成、图像到图像转换、点云生成）上的实验表明，该方法在单步生成建模中实现了更优的推理精度。

Conclusion: 通过结合最优传输策略，提出的方法显著提升了单步生成模型的性能，在保持快速推理的同时更好地近似了原始多步流匹配过程。

Abstract: Flow-matching generative models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for
continuous data generation, achieving state-of-the-art results across domains
such as images, 3D shapes, and point clouds. Despite their success, these
models suffer from slow inference due to the requirement of numerous sequential
sampling steps. Recent work has sought to accelerate inference by reducing the
number of sampling steps. In particular, Mean Flows offer a one-step generation
approach that delivers substantial speedups while retaining strong generative
performance. Yet, in many continuous domains, Mean Flows fail to faithfully
approximate the behavior of the original multi-step flow-matching process. In
this work, we address this limitation by incorporating optimal transport-based
sampling strategies into the Mean Flow framework, enabling one-step generators
that better preserve the fidelity and diversity of the original multi-step flow
process. Experiments on controlled low-dimensional settings and on
high-dimensional tasks such as image generation, image-to-image translation,
and point cloud generation demonstrate that our approach achieves superior
inference accuracy in one-step generative modeling.

*Junkang Wu,Kexin Huang,Jiancan Wu,An Zhang,Xiang Wang,Xiangnan He*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Quantile Advantage Estimation (QAE)方法，用分位数基线替代均值基线，解决RLVR训练中的熵崩溃和熵爆炸问题，实现稳定的强化学习推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于均值的无价值RL方法（如GRPO和DAPO）在奖励异常值情况下会不当惩罚负优势样本，导致训练在熵崩溃和熵爆炸之间振荡。

Method: 提出QAE方法，用分组K-分位数基线替代均值基线，在困难查询中强化罕见成功，在简单查询中针对剩余失败，实现双向熵安全。

Result: QAE稳定了熵值，稀疏化了信用分配（约80%响应获得零优势），在Qwen3-8B/14B-Base模型上对AIME 2024/2025和AMC 2023任务实现了持续的pass@1提升。

Conclusion: 基线设计（而非token级启发式）是扩展RLVR的主要机制，QAE为强化学习推理提供了稳定有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) strengthens LLM
reasoning, but training often oscillates between {entropy collapse} and
{entropy explosion}. We trace both hazards to the mean baseline used in
value-free RL (e.g., GRPO and DAPO), which improperly penalizes
negative-advantage samples under reward outliers. We propose {Quantile
Advantage Estimation} (QAE), replacing the mean with a group-wise K-quantile
baseline. QAE induces a response-level, two-regime gate: on hard queries (p <=
1 - K) it reinforces rare successes, while on easy queries (p > 1 - K) it
targets remaining failures. Under first-order softmax updates, we prove
{two-sided entropy safety}, giving lower and upper bounds on one-step entropy
change that curb explosion and prevent collapse. Empirically, this minimal
modification stabilizes entropy, sparsifies credit assignment (with tuned K,
roughly 80% of responses receive zero advantage), and yields sustained pass@1
gains on Qwen3-8B/14B-Base across AIME 2024/2025 and AMC 2023. These results
identify {baseline design} -- rather than token-level heuristics -- as the
primary mechanism for scaling RLVR.

*Aayush Mishra,Daniel Khashabi,Anqi Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了ICL激活对齐(IA2)技术，通过自蒸馏方法让SFT模型复制ICL的激活模式，从而结合两种方法的优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ICL在数据稀缺情况下比SFT具有更好的泛化性和校准性，但推理计算成本更高。研究能否利用ICL的内部计算来改进SFT的质量。

Method: 引入ICL激活对齐(IA2)自蒸馏技术，在SFT前作为预备步骤，激励SFT模型产生类似ICL的内部推理模式。

Result: 在12个流行基准和2个模型家族上的广泛实验表明，IA2显著提高了模型输出的准确性和校准性。

Conclusion: IA2不仅具有实用价值，还为理解模型适应的内部机制提供了概念窗口。

Abstract: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) is used to specialize model behavior by training
weights to produce intended target responses for queries. In contrast,
In-Context Learning (ICL) adapts models during inference with instructions or
demonstrations in the prompt. ICL can offer better generalizability and more
calibrated responses compared to SFT in data scarce settings, at the cost of
more inference compute. In this work, we ask the question: Can ICL's internal
computations be used to improve the qualities of SFT? We first show that ICL
and SFT produce distinct activation patterns, indicating that the two methods
achieve adaptation through different functional mechanisms. Motivated by this
observation and to use ICL's rich functionality, we introduce ICL Activation
Alignment (IA2), a self-distillation technique which aims to replicate ICL's
activation patterns in SFT models and incentivizes ICL-like internal reasoning.
Performing IA2 as a priming step before SFT significantly improves the accuracy
and calibration of model outputs, as shown by our extensive empirical results
on 12 popular benchmarks and 2 model families. This finding is not only
practically useful, but also offers a conceptual window into the inner
mechanics of model adaptation.

TL;DR: 本文对离散流匹配(DFM)生成模型的端到端训练进行了理论分析，证明了训练后的DFM模型生成分布会收敛到真实数据分布。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DFM是一个有前景的离散生成建模框架，通过训练神经网络来近似变换速度场来学习底层生成动态。本文旨在为DFM提供严格的理论保证。

Method: 通过分解最终分布估计误差，分析生成分布与目标分布之间的总变差距离如何受学习速度场风险控制，并进一步分析该风险的近似误差和估计误差两个主要来源。

Result: 证明了生成分布与目标分布的总变差距离受学习速度场风险控制；量化了Transformer架构表示真实速度的能力；推导了在有限数据集上训练的统计收敛率。

Conclusion: 通过组合这些结果，首次正式证明了训练后的DFM模型生成分布会随着训练集大小的增加而收敛到真实数据分布。

Abstract: We provide a theoretical analysis for end-to-end training Discrete Flow
Matching (DFM) generative models. DFM is a promising discrete generative
modeling framework that learns the underlying generative dynamics by training a
neural network to approximate the transformative velocity field. Our analysis
establishes a clear chain of guarantees by decomposing the final distribution
estimation error. We first prove that the total variation distance between the
generated and target distributions is controlled by the risk of the learned
velocity field. We then bound this risk by analyzing its two primary sources:
(i) Approximation Error, where we quantify the capacity of the Transformer
architecture to represent the true velocity, and (ii) Estimation Error, where
we derive statistical convergence rates that bound the error from training on a
finite dataset. By composing these results, we provide the first formal proof
that the distribution generated by a trained DFM model provably converges to
the true data distribution as the training set size increases.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为交叉熵可容许性（CEA）的损失函数，用于在训练过程中强制启发式函数的可容许性，并在魔方问题上实现了比压缩模式数据库更强的引导效果。同时，通过利用图的结构特性，为A*算法的泛化提供了理论保证。

Motivation: 现有深度学习启发式学习方法往往忽视可容许性要求，且在训练数据之外的泛化能力有限。本文旨在同时解决这两个限制。

Method: 将启发式学习建模为约束优化问题，提出交叉熵可容许性（CEA）损失函数来强制可容许性；利用模式数据库抽象和图的结构特性分析样本复杂度；使用ReLU神经网络提供泛化保证。

Result: 在魔方问题上，该方法产生了接近可容许的启发式函数，其引导能力显著强于压缩模式数据库启发式；为A*算法的泛化提供了理论保证，且该保证主要取决于网络的宽度和深度而非图的大小。

Conclusion: CEA方法能够有效学习接近可容许的启发式函数，同时为启发式学习的泛化提供了理论基础，特别是为依赖目标的启发式函数提供了首个泛化保证。

Abstract: Heuristic functions are central to the performance of search algorithms such
as A-star, where admissibility - the property of never overestimating the true
shortest-path cost - guarantees solution optimality. Recent deep learning
approaches often disregard admissibility and provide limited guarantees on
generalization beyond the training data. This paper addresses both of these
limitations. First, we pose heuristic learning as a constrained optimization
problem and introduce Cross-Entropy Admissibility (CEA), a loss function that
enforces admissibility during training. On the Rubik's Cube domain, this method
yields near-admissible heuristics with significantly stronger guidance than
compressed pattern database (PDB) heuristics. Theoretically, we study the
sample complexity of learning heuristics. By leveraging PDB abstractions and
the structural properties of graphs such as the Rubik's Cube, we tighten the
bound on the number of training samples needed for A-star to generalize.
Replacing a general hypothesis class with a ReLU neural network gives bounds
that depend primarily on the network's width and depth, rather than on graph
size. Using the same network, we also provide the first generalization
guarantees for goal-dependent heuristics.
