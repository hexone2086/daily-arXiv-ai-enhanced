### [1] [Stochastic-based Patch Filtering for Few-Shot Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10066)
*Javier Rodenas,Eduardo Aguilar,Petia Radeva*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPFF方法通过随机过滤与类别相关性低的图像块，提升少样本学习在复杂食物图像上的分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 食物图像的视觉复杂性和多样性导致少样本学习模型容易失去对关键元素的关注，从而造成误分类。

Method: 提出SPFF方法，通过随机过滤与类别表示相关性低的图像块嵌入，利用相似性矩阵量化查询图像与支持图像的关系。

Result: 在Food-101、VireoFood-172和UECFood-256等基准测试中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SPFF能有效聚焦于类别特异性特征显著的图像块，过滤无关块，提升分类准确性。

Abstract: Food images present unique challenges for few-shot learning models due to
their visual complexity and variability. For instance, a pasta dish might
appear with various garnishes on different plates and in diverse lighting
conditions and camera perspectives. This problem leads to losing focus on the
most important elements when comparing the query with support images, resulting
in misclassification. To address this issue, we propose Stochastic-based Patch
Filtering for Few-Shot Learning (SPFF) to attend to the patch embeddings that
show greater correlation with the class representation. The key concept of SPFF
involves the stochastic filtering of patch embeddings, where patches less
similar to the class-aware embedding are more likely to be discarded. With
patch embedding filtered according to the probability of appearance, we use a
similarity matrix that quantifies the relationship between the query image and
its respective support images. Through a qualitative analysis, we demonstrate
that SPFF effectively focuses on patches where class-specific food features are
most prominent while successfully filtering out non-relevant patches. We
validate our approach through extensive experiments on few-shot classification
benchmarks: Food-101, VireoFood-172 and UECFood-256, outperforming the existing
SoA methods.

TL;DR: DINOv3是一种自监督学习的视觉基础模型，通过数据扩展、Gram锚定和后期策略，显著提升性能，无需微调即可超越现有技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 消除手动数据标注需求，实现从多样化数据源学习通用视觉表示的目标。

Method: 结合数据扩展、模型规模优化、Gram锚定技术及后期策略，提升模型灵活性和性能。

Result: DINOv3在多种视觉任务中表现优异，超越现有自监督和弱监督模型。

Conclusion: DINOv3为视觉任务提供了可扩展的高性能解决方案，推动了自监督学习的发展。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning holds the promise of eliminating the need for manual
data annotation, enabling models to scale effortlessly to massive datasets and
larger architectures. By not being tailored to specific tasks or domains, this
training paradigm has the potential to learn visual representations from
diverse sources, ranging from natural to aerial images -- using a single
algorithm. This technical report introduces DINOv3, a major milestone toward
realizing this vision by leveraging simple yet effective strategies. First, we
leverage the benefit of scaling both dataset and model size by careful data
preparation, design, and optimization. Second, we introduce a new method called
Gram anchoring, which effectively addresses the known yet unsolved issue of
dense feature maps degrading during long training schedules. Finally, we apply
post-hoc strategies that further enhance our models' flexibility with respect
to resolution, model size, and alignment with text. As a result, we present a
versatile vision foundation model that outperforms the specialized state of the
art across a broad range of settings, without fine-tuning. DINOv3 produces
high-quality dense features that achieve outstanding performance on various
vision tasks, significantly surpassing previous self- and weakly-supervised
foundation models. We also share the DINOv3 suite of vision models, designed to
advance the state of the art on a wide spectrum of tasks and data by providing
scalable solutions for diverse resource constraints and deployment scenarios.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种多模态学习方法，用于生成变形攻击检测的文本描述，并通过零样本评估验证其效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 变形攻击检测是确保人脸识别系统可靠性的关键，本文旨在通过多模态学习提供可理解的文本描述。

Method: 使用对比语言-图像预训练（CLIP）进行零样本评估，设计了10种文本提示，并结合SOTA预训练神经网络。

Abstract: Morphing attack detection has become an essential component of face
recognition systems for ensuring a reliable verification scenario. In this
paper, we present a multimodal learning approach that can provide a textual
description of morphing attack detection. We first show that zero-shot
evaluation of the proposed framework using Contrastive Language-Image
Pretraining (CLIP) can yield not only generalizable morphing attack detection,
but also predict the most relevant text snippet. We present an extensive
analysis of ten different textual prompts that include both short and long
textual prompts. These prompts are engineered by considering the human
understandable textual snippet. Extensive experiments were performed on a face
morphing dataset that was developed using a publicly available face biometric
dataset. We present an evaluation of SOTA pre-trained neural networks together
with the proposed framework in the zero-shot evaluation of five different
morphing generation techniques that are captured in three different mediums.

### [4] [Interpretable Oracle Bone Script Decipherment through Radical and Pictographic Analysis with LVLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10113)
*Kaixin Peng,Mengyang Zhao,Haiyang Yu,Teng Fu,Bin Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于大型视觉语言模型的可解释甲骨文破译方法，结合部首分析和象形语义理解，显著提升了零样本破译性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 甲骨文因其稀有性、抽象性和象形多样性，破译难度大。现有深度学习方法忽略了字形与语义的复杂联系，导致泛化性和可解释性不足。

Method: 采用渐进式训练策略，从部首识别到象形分析，设计了部首-象形双重匹配机制，并构建了包含47,157个汉字的象形破译数据集。

Result: 在公共基准测试中取得了Top-10准确率和卓越的零样本破译能力，同时提供了逻辑分析过程。

Conclusion: 该方法为未破译甲骨文提供了考古学参考，具有数字人文和历史研究的应用潜力。

Abstract: As the oldest mature writing system, Oracle Bone Script (OBS) has long posed
significant challenges for archaeological decipherment due to its rarity,
abstractness, and pictographic diversity. Current deep learning-based methods
have made exciting progress on the OBS decipherment task, but existing
approaches often ignore the intricate connections between glyphs and the
semantics of OBS. This results in limited generalization and interpretability,
especially when addressing zero-shot settings and undeciphered OBS. To this
end, we propose an interpretable OBS decipherment method based on Large
Vision-Language Models, which synergistically combines radical analysis and
pictograph-semantic understanding to bridge the gap between glyphs and meanings
of OBS. Specifically, we propose a progressive training strategy that guides
the model from radical recognition and analysis to pictographic analysis and
mutual analysis, thus enabling reasoning from glyph to meaning. We also design
a Radical-Pictographic Dual Matching mechanism informed by the analysis
results, significantly enhancing the model's zero-shot decipherment
performance. To facilitate model training, we propose the Pictographic
Decipherment OBS Dataset, which comprises 47,157 Chinese characters annotated
with OBS images and pictographic analysis texts. Experimental results on public
benchmarks demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art Top-10
accuracy and superior zero-shot decipherment capabilities. More importantly,
our model delivers logical analysis processes, possibly providing
archaeologically valuable reference results for undeciphered OBS, and thus has
potential applications in digital humanities and historical research. The
dataset and code will be released in https://github.com/PKXX1943/PD-OBS.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 开发了一种基于深度学习的自动标记方法，用于全身双能X射线吸收测量（TBDXA）扫描，并在外部测试数据集中达到99.5%的关键点正确率。该方法用于形状和外观建模（SAM），并与健康标志物关联分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TBDXA是一种低成本的全身体成像技术，广泛用于身体成分评估。开发自动标记方法以提高效率和准确性。

Method: 使用1,683个手动标注的TBDXA扫描训练深度学习模型，自动放置关键点。

Result: 在外部测试数据集中达到99.5%的关键点正确率，并成功用于SAM建模，关联分析了健康标志物。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅验证了现有证据，还生成了关于身体成分与健康标志物关系的新假设，相关代码和模型已开源。

Abstract: Total-body dual X-ray absorptiometry (TBDXA) imaging is a relatively low-cost
whole-body imaging modality, widely used for body composition assessment. We
develop and validate a deep learning method for automatic fiducial point
placement on TBDXA scans using 1,683 manually-annotated TBDXA scans. The method
achieves 99.5% percentage correct keypoints in an external testing dataset. To
demonstrate the value for shape and appearance modeling (SAM), our method is
used to place keypoints on 35,928 scans for five different TBDXA imaging modes,
then associations with health markers are tested in two cohorts not used for
SAM model generation using two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests. SAM feature
distributions associated with health biomarkers are shown to corroborate
existing evidence and generate new hypotheses on body composition and shape's
relationship to various frailty, metabolic, inflammation, and cardiometabolic
health markers. Evaluation scripts, model weights, automatic point file
generation code, and triangulation files are available at

### [6] [MANGO: Multimodal Attention-based Normalizing Flow Approach to Fusion Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10133)
*Thanh-Dat Truong,Christophe Bobda,Nitin Agarwal,Khoa Luu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的多模态融合方法MANGO，通过可逆交叉注意力层（ICA）和三种新的交叉注意力机制，实现了显式、可解释的多模态学习，并在多个任务中达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态融合方法依赖Transformer的注意力机制，难以捕捉模态间的本质特征和复杂关联，限制了模型的理解能力。

Method: 提出MANGO方法，包括可逆交叉注意力层（ICA）和三种新机制（MMCA、IMCA、LICA），用于显式学习多模态数据的复杂关联。

Result: 在语义分割、图像到图像翻译和电影类型分类三个任务中，MANGO表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MANGO通过显式和可解释的多模态融合，显著提升了模型性能，适用于高维多模态数据。

Abstract: Multimodal learning has gained much success in recent years. However, current
multimodal fusion methods adopt the attention mechanism of Transformers to
implicitly learn the underlying correlation of multimodal features. As a
result, the multimodal model cannot capture the essential features of each
modality, making it difficult to comprehend complex structures and correlations
of multimodal inputs. This paper introduces a novel Multimodal Attention-based
Normalizing Flow (MANGO) approach\footnote{The source code of this work will be
publicly available.} to developing explicit, interpretable, and tractable
multimodal fusion learning. In particular, we propose a new Invertible
Cross-Attention (ICA) layer to develop the Normalizing Flow-based Model for
multimodal data. To efficiently capture the complex, underlying correlations in
multimodal data in our proposed invertible cross-attention layer, we propose
three new cross-attention mechanisms: Modality-to-Modality Cross-Attention
(MMCA), Inter-Modality Cross-Attention (IMCA), and Learnable Inter-Modality
Cross-Attention (LICA). Finally, we introduce a new Multimodal Attention-based
Normalizing Flow to enable the scalability of our proposed method to
high-dimensional multimodal data. Our experimental results on three different
multimodal learning tasks, i.e., semantic segmentation, image-to-image
translation, and movie genre classification, have illustrated the
state-of-the-art (SoTA) performance of the proposed approach.

### [7] [Improving watermelon (Citrullus lanatus) disease classification with generative artificial intelligence (GenAI)-based synthetic and real-field images via a custom EfficientNetV2-L model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10156)
*Nitin Rai,Nathan S. Boyd,Gary E. Vallad,Arnold W. Schumann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究探讨了结合少量真实图像与合成图像是否能提升西瓜病害分类模型的性能，发现混合使用显著提高了模型表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估生成式AI模型在农业病害诊断中的潜力，减少对资源密集型实地数据收集的依赖。

Method: 使用EfficientNetV2-L模型，比较五种不同真实与合成图像比例的训练数据集（H0-H4）。

Result: 混合数据集（H2-H4）表现最佳，F1分数从0.65提升至1.00，表明少量真实图像与大量合成图像结合效果显著。

Conclusion: 合成图像无法完全替代真实图像，混合使用可最大化模型性能。

Abstract: The current advancements in generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) models
have paved the way for new possibilities for generating high-resolution
synthetic images, thereby offering a promising alternative to traditional image
acquisition for training computer vision models in agriculture. In the context
of crop disease diagnosis, GenAI models are being used to create synthetic
images of various diseases, potentially facilitating model creation and
reducing the dependency on resource-intensive in-field data collection.
However, limited research has been conducted on evaluating the effectiveness of
integrating real with synthetic images to improve disease classification
performance. Therefore, this study aims to investigate whether combining a
limited number of real images with synthetic images can enhance the prediction
accuracy of an EfficientNetV2-L model for classifying watermelon
\textit{(Citrullus lanatus)} diseases. The training dataset was divided into
five treatments: H0 (only real images), H1 (only synthetic images), H2 (1:1
real-to-synthetic), H3 (1:10 real-to-synthetic), and H4 (H3 + random images to
improve variability and model generalization). All treatments were trained
using a custom EfficientNetV2-L architecture with enhanced fine-tuning and
transfer learning techniques. Models trained on H2, H3, and H4 treatments
demonstrated high precision, recall, and F1-score metrics. Additionally, the
weighted F1-score increased from 0.65 (on H0) to 1.00 (on H3-H4) signifying
that the addition of a small number of real images with a considerable volume
of synthetic images improved model performance and generalizability. Overall,
this validates the findings that synthetic images alone cannot adequately
substitute for real images; instead, both must be used in a hybrid manner to
maximize model performance for crop disease classification.

### [8] [SynSpill: Improved Industrial Spill Detection With Synthetic Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10171)
*Aaditya Baranwal,Abdul Mueez,Jason Voelker,Guneet Bhatia,Shruti Vyas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于合成数据的框架，用于提升视觉语言模型（VLMs）在安全关键领域（如工业泄漏检测）中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于隐私、数据敏感性和事件罕见性，真实数据稀缺，传统微调方法不可行。

Method: 通过高质量合成数据生成管道，结合参数高效微调（PEFT）技术，优化VLM和目标检测器（如YOLO和DETR）。

Result: 合成数据显著提升了性能，使VLM和检测器在未见泄漏场景中表现接近。

Conclusion: 高保真合成数据是解决安全关键领域数据稀缺问题的有效方法，结合轻量级适配，提供了一种经济高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Large-scale Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have transformed general-purpose
visual recognition through strong zero-shot capabilities. However, their
performance degrades significantly in niche, safety-critical domains such as
industrial spill detection, where hazardous events are rare, sensitive, and
difficult to annotate. This scarcity -- driven by privacy concerns, data
sensitivity, and the infrequency of real incidents -- renders conventional
fine-tuning of detectors infeasible for most industrial settings.
  We address this challenge by introducing a scalable framework centered on a
high-quality synthetic data generation pipeline. We demonstrate that this
synthetic corpus enables effective Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) of
VLMs and substantially boosts the performance of state-of-the-art object
detectors such as YOLO and DETR. Notably, in the absence of synthetic data
(SynSpill dataset), VLMs still generalize better to unseen spill scenarios than
these detectors. When SynSpill is used, both VLMs and detectors achieve marked
improvements, with their performance becoming comparable.
  Our results underscore that high-fidelity synthetic data is a powerful means
to bridge the domain gap in safety-critical applications. The combination of
synthetic generation and lightweight adaptation offers a cost-effective,
scalable pathway for deploying vision systems in industrial environments where
real data is scarce/impractical to obtain.

### [9] [EntropyGS: An Efficient Entropy Coding on 3D Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10227)
*Yuning Huang,Jiahao Pang,Fengqing Zhu,Dong Tian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 3D高斯泼溅（3DGS）是一种新兴的视图合成方法，具有快速训练/渲染和高质量视觉效果的优点。本文提出了一种基于统计分析的熵编码方法EntropyGS，显著降低了数据率，同时保持渲染质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3DGS的高斯创建和视图渲染任务通常分离，导致存储/传输和压缩需求。本文旨在通过统计分析高斯属性，提出高效的压缩方法。

Method: 通过统计分析发现球谐AC属性服从拉普拉斯分布，旋转、缩放和不透明度可用高斯混合模型近似。提出因子化和参数化的熵编码方法EntropyGS，自适应量化属性类型。

Result: EntropyGS在基准数据集上实现了约30倍的数据率降低，同时保持与输入3DGS数据相似的渲染质量，且编解码速度快。

Conclusion: EntropyGS是一种高效的3DGS高斯属性压缩方法，显著减少了存储和传输需求，同时保持高质量的渲染效果。

Abstract: As an emerging novel view synthesis approach, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)
demonstrates fast training/rendering with superior visual quality. The two
tasks of 3DGS, Gaussian creation and view rendering, are typically separated
over time or devices, and thus storage/transmission and finally compression of
3DGS Gaussians become necessary. We begin with a correlation and statistical
analysis of 3DGS Gaussian attributes. An inspiring finding in this work reveals
that spherical harmonic AC attributes precisely follow Laplace distributions,
while mixtures of Gaussian distributions can approximate rotation, scaling, and
opacity. Additionally, harmonic AC attributes manifest weak correlations with
other attributes except for inherited correlations from a color space. A
factorized and parameterized entropy coding method, EntropyGS, is hereinafter
proposed. During encoding, distribution parameters of each Gaussian attribute
are estimated to assist their entropy coding. The quantization for entropy
coding is adaptively performed according to Gaussian attribute types. EntropyGS
demonstrates about 30x rate reduction on benchmark datasets while maintaining
similar rendering quality compared to input 3DGS data, with a fast encoding and
decoding time.

Abstract: Xenium, a new spatial transcriptomics platform, enables
subcellular-resolution profiling of complex tumor tissues. Despite the rich
morphological information in histology images, extracting robust cell-level
features and integrating them with spatial transcriptomics data remains a
critical challenge. We introduce CellSymphony, a flexible multimodal framework
that leverages foundation model-derived embeddings from both Xenium
transcriptomic profiles and histology images at true single-cell resolution. By
learning joint representations that fuse spatial gene expression with
morphological context, CellSymphony achieves accurate cell type annotation and
uncovers distinct microenvironmental niches across three cancer types. This
work highlights the potential of foundation models and multimodal fusion for
deciphering the physiological and phenotypic orchestration of cells within
complex tissue ecosystems.

Abstract: Crack detection plays a crucial role in civil infrastructures, including
inspection of pavements, buildings, etc., and deep learning has significantly
advanced this field in recent years. While numerous technical and review papers
exist in this domain, emerging trends are reshaping the landscape. These shifts
include transitions in learning paradigms (from fully supervised learning to
semi-supervised, weakly-supervised, unsupervised, few-shot, domain adaptation
and fine-tuning foundation models), improvements in generalizability (from
single-dataset performance to cross-dataset evaluation), and diversification in
dataset reacquisition (from RGB images to specialized sensor-based data). In
this review, we systematically analyze these trends and highlight
representative works. Additionally, we introduce a new dataset collected with
3D laser scans, 3DCrack, to support future research and conduct extensive
benchmarking experiments to establish baselines for commonly used deep learning
methodologies, including recent foundation models. Our findings provide
insights into the evolving methodologies and future directions in deep

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练的解码方法MRFD，通过建模区域间一致性减少幻觉，提升事实性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LVLMs在多模态任务中因视觉信息验证能力有限而产生的幻觉问题。

Method: 利用交叉注意力识别显著区域，生成初始响应，基于JSD计算可靠性权重，并通过一致性融合预测。

Result: 实验表明MRFD显著减少幻觉并提升事实性，无需模型更新。

Conclusion: MRFD是一种有效的训练无关方法，能显著提升LVLMs的事实性表现。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have shown strong performance across
multimodal tasks. However, they often produce hallucinations -- text that is
inconsistent with visual input, due to the limited ability to verify
information in different regions of the image. To address this, we propose
Multi-Region Fusion Decoding (MRFD), a training-free decoding method that
improves factual grounding by modeling inter-region consistency. MRFD
identifies salient regions using cross-attention, generates initial responses
for each, and computes reliability weights based on Jensen-Shannon Divergence
(JSD) among the responses. These weights guide a consistency-aware fusion of
per-region predictions, using region-aware prompts inspired by Chain-of-Thought
reasoning. Experiments across multiple LVLMs and benchmarks show that MRFD
significantly reduces hallucinations and improves response factuality without
requiring model updates.

*Yujie Zhao,Jiabei Zeng,Shiguang Shan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文研究了如何通过动态校准策略提高基于外观的注视点（PoG）估计的鲁棒性，特别是在头部姿态变化的情况下。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PoG估计器因个体差异和头部姿态变化而表现不佳，需改进校准策略以提高泛化能力。

Method: 构建MobilePoG基准，分析校准点和头部姿态多样性对精度的影响，提出动态校准策略。

Result: 实验表明，校准时引入更多头部姿态变化能提升估计器对姿态变化的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 动态校准策略显著提高了PoG估计器的性能，减少了对头部姿态变化的敏感性。

Abstract: Although appearance-based point-of-gaze (PoG) estimation has improved, the
estimators still struggle to generalize across individuals due to personal
differences. Therefore, person-specific calibration is required for accurate
PoG estimation. However, calibrated PoG estimators are often sensitive to head
pose variations. To address this, we investigate the key factors influencing
calibrated estimators and explore pose-robust calibration strategies.
Specifically, we first construct a benchmark, MobilePoG, which includes facial
images from 32 individuals focusing on designated points under either fixed or
continuously changing head poses. Using this benchmark, we systematically
analyze how the diversity of calibration points and head poses influences
estimation accuracy. Our experiments show that introducing a wider range of
head poses during calibration improves the estimator's ability to handle pose
variation. Building on this insight, we propose a dynamic calibration strategy
in which users fixate on calibration points while moving their phones. This
strategy naturally introduces head pose variation during a user-friendly and
efficient calibration process, ultimately producing a better calibrated PoG
estimator that is less sensitive to head pose variations than those using
conventional calibration strategies. Codes and datasets are available at our
project page.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合文本-图像对比约束和结构引导机制的高保真图像生成方法，解决了现有方法在语义对齐和结构一致性上的瓶颈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本驱动图像生成方法在语义对齐准确性和结构一致性上存在性能瓶颈，需改进。

Method: 整合文本-图像对比学习模块和结构先验（如语义布局图或边缘草图），联合优化对比损失、结构一致性损失和语义保留损失。

Result: 在COCO-2014数据集上验证，量化指标（CLIP Score、FID、SSIM）显示性能优越，语义对齐与结构保真度显著提升。

Conclusion: 该方法在不增加计算复杂度的情况下，有效平衡语义对齐与结构保真，为文本-图像联合建模提供了可行技术路径。

Abstract: This paper addresses the performance bottlenecks of existing text-driven
image generation methods in terms of semantic alignment accuracy and structural
consistency. A high-fidelity image generation method is proposed by integrating
text-image contrastive constraints with structural guidance mechanisms. The
approach introduces a contrastive learning module that builds strong
cross-modal alignment constraints to improve semantic matching between text and
image. At the same time, structural priors such as semantic layout maps or edge
sketches are used to guide the generator in spatial-level structural modeling.
This enhances the layout completeness and detail fidelity of the generated
images. Within the overall framework, the model jointly optimizes contrastive
loss, structural consistency loss, and semantic preservation loss. A
multi-objective supervision mechanism is adopted to improve the semantic
consistency and controllability of the generated content. Systematic
experiments are conducted on the COCO-2014 dataset. Sensitivity analyses are
performed on embedding dimensions, text length, and structural guidance
strength. Quantitative metrics confirm the superior performance of the proposed
method in terms of CLIP Score, FID, and SSIM. The results show that the method
effectively bridges the gap between semantic alignment and structural fidelity
without increasing computational complexity. It demonstrates a strong ability
to generate semantically clear and structurally complete images, offering a
viable technical path for joint text-image modeling and image generation.

domains, including sports analytics. In figure skating, accurately recognizing
the type and timing of jumps a skater performs is essential for objective
performance evaluation. However, this task typically requires expert-level
knowledge due to the fine-grained and complex nature of jump procedures. While
recent approaches have attempted to automate this task using Temporal Action
Segmentation (TAS), there are two major limitations to TAS for figure skating:
the annotated data is insufficient, and existing methods do not account for the
inherent three-dimensional aspects and procedural structure of jump actions. In
this work, we propose a new TAS framework for figure skating jumps that
explicitly incorporates both the three-dimensional nature and the semantic
procedure of jump movements. First, we propose a novel View-Invariant, Figure
Skating-Specific pose representation learning approach (VIFSS) that combines
contrastive learning as pre-training and action classification as fine-tuning.
For view-invariant contrastive pre-training, we construct FS-Jump3D, the first
publicly available 3D pose dataset specialized for figure skating jumps.
Second, we introduce a fine-grained annotation scheme that marks the ``entry
(preparation)'' and ``landing'' phases, enabling TAS models to learn the
procedural structure of jumps. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our framework. Our method achieves over 92% F1@50 on
element-level TAS, which requires recognizing both jump types and rotation
levels. Furthermore, we show that view-invariant contrastive pre-training is
particularly effective when fine-tuning data is limited, highlighting the
practicality of our approach in real-world scenarios.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的视觉推理基准JRDB-Reasoning，通过定义推理复杂性、自适应查询引擎和扩展数据集来解决现有基准的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉推理基准缺乏对复杂性定义、任务定制和结构化推理注释的控制，限制了视觉语言模型在复杂环境中的评估。

Method: 通过形式化推理复杂性，引入自适应查询引擎生成可定制问题，并扩展JRDB数据集以包含人-物交互和几何关系注释。

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and large language models
(LLMs) have greatly enhanced visual reasoning, a key capability for embodied AI
agents like robots. However, existing visual reasoning benchmarks often suffer
from several limitations: they lack a clear definition of reasoning complexity,
offer have no control to generate questions over varying difficulty and task
customization, and fail to provide structured, step-by-step reasoning
annotations (workflows). To bridge these gaps, we formalize reasoning
complexity, introduce an adaptive query engine that generates customizable
questions of varying complexity with detailed intermediate annotations, and
extend the JRDB dataset with human-object interaction and geometric
relationship annotations to create JRDB-Reasoning, a benchmark tailored for
visual reasoning in human-crowded environments. Our engine and benchmark enable
fine-grained evaluation of visual reasoning frameworks and dynamic assessment
of visual-language models across reasoning levels.

*Tao Huang,Hongbo Pan,Nanxi Zhou,Shun Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于相位一致性加权最小绝对偏差（PCWLAD）的亚像素模板匹配方法，用于提高多模态光学图像的匹配精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多模态光学图像因不同光谱响应导致的非线性辐射和几何形变差异问题。

Method: 分为粗匹配（使用SSIM）和精细匹配（使用WLAD），结合相位一致性加权和互结构滤波。

Result: 在三种数据集上表现优于现有八种方法，平均匹配精度约为0.4像素。

Conclusion: PCWLAD在多模态图像匹配中具有高精度和鲁棒性。

Abstract: High-accuracy matching of multimodal optical images is the basis of geometric
processing. However, the image matching accuracy is usually degraded by the
nonlinear radiation and geometric deformation differences caused by different
spectral responses. To address these problems, we proposed a phase consistency
weighted least absolute deviation (PCWLAD) sub-pixel template matching method
to improve the matching accuracy of multimodal optical images. This method
consists of two main steps: coarse matching with the structural similarity
index measure (SSIM) and fine matching with WLAD. In the coarse matching step,
PCs are calculated without a noise filter to preserve the original structural
details, and template matching is performed using the SSIM. In the fine
matching step, we applied the radiometric and geometric transformation models
between two multimodal PC templates based on the coarse matching. Furthermore,
mutual structure filtering is adopted in the model to mitigate the impact of
noise within the corresponding templates on the structural consistency, and the
WLAD criterion is used to estimate the sub-pixel offset. To evaluate the
performance of PCWLAD, we created three types of image datasets: visible to
infrared Landsat images, visible to near-infrared close-range images, and
visible to infrared uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) images. PCWLAD outperformed
existing state-of-the-art eight methods in terms of correct matching rate (CMR)
and root mean square error (RMSE) and reached an average matching accuracy of
approximately 0.4 pixels across all three datasets. Our software and datasets
are publicly available at https://github.com/huangtaocsu/PCWLAD.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常将单人及多人动态分开处理，难以捕捉真实场景中的自然交互与协调。

Method: InterSyn包含两个模块：INS模块统一建模单人及交互行为，REC模块优化角色间的动态协调。

Result: 实验表明，InterSyn生成的动作文本对齐性更高、多样性更强，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: InterSyn为自然运动合成设定了新基准，未来将开源代码以推动研究。

Abstract: We present Interleaved Learning for Motion Synthesis (InterSyn), a novel
framework that targets the generation of realistic interaction motions by
learning from integrated motions that consider both solo and multi-person
dynamics. Unlike previous methods that treat these components separately,
InterSyn employs an interleaved learning strategy to capture the natural,
dynamic interactions and nuanced coordination inherent in real-world scenarios.
Our framework comprises two key modules: the Interleaved Interaction Synthesis
(INS) module, which jointly models solo and interactive behaviors in a unified
paradigm from a first-person perspective to support multiple character
interactions, and the Relative Coordination Refinement (REC) module, which
refines mutual dynamics and ensures synchronized motions among characters.
Experimental results show that the motion sequences generated by InterSyn
exhibit higher text-to-motion alignment and improved diversity compared with
recent methods, setting a new benchmark for robust and natural motion
synthesis. Additionally, our code will be open-sourced in the future to promote
further research and development in this area.

Result: 系统回顾了自动驾驶场景中的OoD分割进展，并指出了挑战。

Conclusion: OoD分割在安全关键应用中至关重要，未来研究需解决现有挑战。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OoD) detection and segmentation have attracted growing
attention as concerns about AI security rise. Conventional OoD detection
methods identify the existence of OoD objects but lack spatial localization,
limiting their usefulness in downstream tasks. OoD segmentation addresses this
limitation by localizing anomalous objects at pixel-level granularity. This
capability is crucial for safety-critical applications such as autonomous
driving, where perception modules must not only detect but also precisely
segment OoD objects, enabling targeted control actions and enhancing overall
system robustness. In this survey, we group current OoD segmentation approaches
into four categories: (i) test-time OoD segmentation, (ii) outlier exposure for
supervised training, (iii) reconstruction-based methods, (iv) and approaches
that leverage powerful models. We systematically review recent advances in OoD
segmentation for autonomous-driving scenarios, identify emerging challenges,
and discuss promising future research directions.

Conclusion: 综述总结了强化学习与生成建模交叉领域的开放挑战和未来研究方向。

Abstract: Generative models have made significant progress in synthesizing visual
content, including images, videos, and 3D/4D structures. However, they are
typically trained with surrogate objectives such as likelihood or
reconstruction loss, which often misalign with perceptual quality, semantic
accuracy, or physical realism. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a principled
framework for optimizing non-differentiable, preference-driven, and temporally
structured objectives. Recent advances demonstrate its effectiveness in
enhancing controllability, consistency, and human alignment across generative
tasks. This survey provides a systematic overview of RL-based methods for
visual content generation. We review the evolution of RL from classical control
to its role as a general-purpose optimization tool, and examine its integration
into image, video, and 3D/4D generation. Across these domains, RL serves not
only as a fine-tuning mechanism but also as a structural component for aligning
generation with complex, high-level goals. We conclude with open challenges and
future research directions at the intersection of RL and generative modeling.

Conclusion: SpaRC-AD通过雷达融合显著提升了自动驾驶系统在安全关键场景中的性能，验证了雷达在精确运动理解和长时程轨迹预测中的有效性。

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving systems promise stronger performance through
unified optimization of perception, motion forecasting, and planning. However,
vision-based approaches face fundamental limitations in adverse weather
conditions, partial occlusions, and precise velocity estimation - critical
challenges in safety-sensitive scenarios where accurate motion understanding
and long-horizon trajectory prediction are essential for collision avoidance.
To address these limitations, we propose SpaRC-AD, a query-based end-to-end
camera-radar fusion framework for planning-oriented autonomous driving. Through
sparse 3D feature alignment, and doppler-based velocity estimation, we achieve
strong 3D scene representations for refinement of agent anchors, map polylines
and motion modelling. Our method achieves strong improvements over the
state-of-the-art vision-only baselines across multiple autonomous driving
tasks, including 3D detection (+4.8% mAP), multi-object tracking (+8.3% AMOTA),
online mapping (+1.8% mAP), motion prediction (-4.0% mADE), and trajectory
planning (-0.1m L2 and -9% TPC). We achieve both spatial coherence and temporal
consistency on multiple challenging benchmarks, including real-world open-loop
nuScenes, long-horizon T-nuScenes, and closed-loop simulator Bench2Drive. We
show the effectiveness of radar-based fusion in safety-critical scenarios where
accurate motion understanding and long-horizon trajectory prediction are
essential for collision avoidance. The source code of all experiments is

Result: 在10多个基准测试上验证了方法的有效性，平均性能提升0.9%，技能子集提升1.5%。

Conclusion: 研究表明指令选择需平衡概念知识与视觉技能，强调了定向数据选择的重要性。

Abstract: Vision-language instruction tuning achieves two main purposes: learning
visual concepts and learning visual skills. In this paper, we found that
vision-language benchmarks fall into the dichotomy of mainly benefiting from
training on instructions with similar skills or visual concepts. Inspired by
the discovery, we designed a simple targeted training data selection method to
optimize the performance of a given benchmark. We first extract the
concepts/skills from the benchmark, determine whether the benchmark
predominantly benefits from similar concepts or skills, and finally select
instructions with the most matching concepts/skills. Experiments on 10+
benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our targeted data selection method,
showing +0.9\% over the best existing baseline averaged over all benchmarks and
+1.5\% on the skill-focused subset. Our findings underscore the importance of
recognizing the inherent trade-off within instruction selection, which requires
balancing the acquisition of conceptual knowledge against visual skill.

Motivation: 当前研究多关注单一超微结构识别，难以满足实际诊断需求，需同时量化多种特征。

Method: 基于三个深度学习模型（超微结构分割、滤过屏障分类、电子致密沉积物检测），量化肾小球基底膜厚度、足突消失程度和电子致密沉积物位置。

Result: 在115例患者中验证，自动量化结果与病理报告形态描述一致，具备高精度和高通量特性。

Abstract: Complex and diverse ultrastructural features can indicate the type,
progression, and prognosis of kidney diseases. Recently, computational
pathology combined with deep learning methods has shown tremendous potential in
advancing automatic morphological analysis of glomerular ultrastructure.
However, current research predominantly focuses on the recognition of
individual ultrastructure, which makes it challenging to meet practical
diagnostic needs. In this study, we propose the glomerular morphometry
framework of ultrastructural characterization (Glo-DMU), which is grounded on
three deep models: the ultrastructure segmentation model, the glomerular
filtration barrier region classification model, and the electron-dense deposits
detection model. Following the conventional protocol of renal biopsy diagnosis,
this framework simultaneously quantifies the three most widely used
ultrastructural features: the thickness of glomerular basement membrane, the
degree of foot process effacement, and the location of electron-dense deposits.
We evaluated the 115 patients with 9 renal pathological types in real-world
diagnostic scenarios, demonstrating good consistency between automatic
quantification results and morphological descriptions in the pathological
reports. Glo-DMU possesses the characteristics of full automation, high
precision, and high throughput, quantifying multiple ultrastructural features
simultaneously, and providing an efficient tool for assisting renal
pathologists.

Motivation: 时间分辨STEM数据因空间漂移和辐射损伤而难以解析，现有方法无法明确分离这些降解效应或建模原子分辨率的材料动力学。

Method: 提出AtomDiffuser框架，通过预测仿射变换和空间变化衰减图来解耦样本漂移和辐射衰减，利用物理启发的时间条件过程进行建模。

Conclusion: AtomDiffuser为原子分辨率下的材料动态研究提供了可解释的工具，解决了STEM数据中降解效应的分离问题。

Abstract: Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) plays a critical role in
modern materials science, enabling direct imaging of atomic structures and
their evolution under external interferences. However, interpreting
time-resolved STEM data remains challenging due to two entangled degradation
effects: spatial drift caused by mechanical and thermal instabilities, and
beam-induced signal loss resulting from radiation damage. These factors distort
both geometry and intensity in complex, temporally correlated ways, making it
difficult for existing methods to explicitly separate their effects or model
material dynamics at atomic resolution. In this work, we present AtomDiffuser,
a time-aware degradation modeling framework that disentangles sample drift and
radiometric attenuation by predicting an affine transformation and a spatially
varying decay map between any two STEM frames. Unlike traditional denoising or
registration pipelines, our method leverages degradation as a physically
heuristic, temporally conditioned process, enabling interpretable structural
evolutions across time. Trained on synthetic degradation processes,
AtomDiffuser also generalizes well to real-world cryo-STEM data. It further
supports high-resolution degradation inference and drift alignment, offering
tools for visualizing and quantifying degradation patterns that correlate with
radiation-induced atomic instabilities.

Abstract: Assessing the alignment of multimodal vision-language models~(VLMs) with
human perception is essential to understand how they perceive low-level visual
features. A key characteristic of human vision is the contrast sensitivity
function (CSF), which describes sensitivity to spatial frequency at
low-contrasts. Here, we introduce a novel behavioral psychophysics-inspired
method to estimate the CSF of chat-based VLMs by directly prompting them to
judge pattern visibility at different contrasts for each frequency. This
methodology is closer to the real experiments in psychophysics than the
previously reported. Using band-pass filtered noise images and a diverse set of
prompts, we assess model responses across multiple architectures. We find that
while some models approximate human-like CSF shape or magnitude, none fully
replicate both. Notably, prompt phrasing has a large effect on the responses,
raising concerns about prompt stability. Our results provide a new framework
for probing visual sensitivity in multimodal models and reveal key gaps between
their visual representations and human perception.

Motivation: 现有图像生成模型因缺乏对场景结构和空间布局的充分理解，常生成空间不一致或扭曲的图像。本文旨在利用场景内在属性（如深度、分割图）提供更丰富的结构信息，从而生成更一致和真实的图像。

Method: 首先从大规模图像数据集中提取场景内在属性，并通过自编码器将其聚合为单一潜在变量。基于预训练的潜在扩散模型（LDM），同时去噪图像和内在属性域，共享信息以保持一致性。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能纠正空间不一致性，生成更自然的场景布局，同时保持基础模型（如Stable Diffusion）的保真度和文本对齐性。

Conclusion: 通过联合生成图像和场景内在属性，本文方法显著提升了生成图像的空间一致性和真实性。

Abstract: Image generation models trained on large datasets can synthesize high-quality
images but often produce spatially inconsistent and distorted images due to
limited information about the underlying structures and spatial layouts. In
this work, we leverage intrinsic scene properties (e.g., depth, segmentation
maps) that provide rich information about the underlying scene, unlike prior
approaches that solely rely on image-text pairs or use intrinsics as
conditional inputs. Our approach aims to co-generate both images and their
corresponding intrinsics, enabling the model to implicitly capture the
underlying scene structure and generate more spatially consistent and realistic
images. Specifically, we first extract rich intrinsic scene properties from a
large image dataset with pre-trained estimators, eliminating the need for
additional scene information or explicit 3D representations. We then aggregate
various intrinsic scene properties into a single latent variable using an
autoencoder. Building upon pre-trained large-scale Latent Diffusion Models
(LDMs), our method simultaneously denoises the image and intrinsic domains by
carefully sharing mutual information so that the image and intrinsic reflect
each other without degrading image quality. Experimental results demonstrate
that our method corrects spatial inconsistencies and produces a more natural
layout of scenes while maintaining the fidelity and textual alignment of the
base model (e.g., Stable Diffusion).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实数据集中的隐式标签噪声（如模糊边界和标注者差异）会影响模型性能，传统数据增强方法可能放大这些问题。

Method: NSegment+仅对分割标签施加弹性变形，保持原始图像不变，以学习对标签不一致的鲁棒表示。

Result: 在多个数据集上，NSegment+平均提升mIoU达+2.29至+3.39，且与其他训练技巧结合效果更佳。

Conclusion: 处理隐式标签噪声对提升语义分割性能至关重要，NSegment+为此提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: While previous studies on image segmentation focus on handling severe (or
explicit) label noise, real-world datasets also exhibit subtle (or implicit)
label imperfections. These arise from inherent challenges, such as ambiguous
object boundaries and annotator variability. Although not explicitly present,
such mild and latent noise can still impair model performance. Typical data
augmentation methods, which apply identical transformations to the image and
its label, risk amplifying these subtle imperfections and limiting the model's
generalization capacity. In this paper, we introduce NSegment+, a novel
augmentation framework that decouples image and label transformations to
address such realistic noise for semantic segmentation. By introducing
controlled elastic deformations only to segmentation labels while preserving
the original images, our method encourages models to focus on learning robust
representations of object structures despite minor label inconsistencies.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that NSegment+ consistently improves
performance, achieving mIoU gains of up to +2.29, +2.38, +1.75, and +3.39 in
average on Vaihingen, LoveDA, Cityscapes, and PASCAL VOC, respectively-even
without bells and whistles, highlighting the importance of addressing implicit
label noise. These gains can be further amplified when combined with other
training tricks, including CutMix and Label Smoothing.

Motivation: 驾驶员分心检测对交通安全至关重要，但现有模型在真实场景中泛化能力不足，主要源于数据标注成本高和领域偏移问题。

Conclusion: PQ-DAF通过数据增强和样本质量控制，有效解决了驾驶员分心检测中的数据稀缺和领域适应问题。

Abstract: Driver distraction detection is essential for improving traffic safety and
reducing road accidents. However, existing models often suffer from degraded
generalization when deployed in real-world scenarios. This limitation primarily
arises from the few-shot learning challenge caused by the high cost of data
annotation in practical environments, as well as the substantial domain shift
between training datasets and target deployment conditions. To address these
issues, we propose a Pose-driven Quality-controlled Data Augmentation Framework
(PQ-DAF) that leverages a vision-language model for sample filtering to
cost-effectively expand training data and enhance cross-domain robustness.
Specifically, we employ a Progressive Conditional Diffusion Model (PCDMs) to
accurately capture key driver pose features and synthesize diverse training
examples. A sample quality assessment module, built upon the CogVLM
vision-language model, is then introduced to filter out low-quality synthetic
samples based on a confidence threshold, ensuring the reliability of the
augmented dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PQ-DAF substantially
improves performance in few-shot driver distraction detection, achieving
significant gains in model generalization under data-scarce conditions.

Method: 引入delta向量修改文本嵌入，削弱不想要内容的影响，并通过零样本方法获取delta向量；进一步提出SSDV方法，将delta向量应用于交叉注意力机制。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在定量和定性指标上均显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法有效抑制了不想要的内容生成，尤其在个性化T2I模型中表现更优。

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) diffusion models have made significant progress in
generating diverse high-quality images from textual prompts. However, these
models still face challenges in suppressing content that is strongly entangled
with specific words. For example, when generating an image of ``Charlie
Chaplin", a ``mustache" consistently appears even if explicitly instructed not
to include it, as the concept of ``mustache" is strongly entangled with
``Charlie Chaplin". To address this issue, we propose a novel approach to
directly suppress such entangled content within the text embedding space of
diffusion models. Our method introduces a delta vector that modifies the text
embedding to weaken the influence of undesired content in the generated image,
and we further demonstrate that this delta vector can be easily obtained
through a zero-shot approach. Furthermore, we propose a Selective Suppression
with Delta Vector (SSDV) method to adapt delta vector into the cross-attention
mechanism, enabling more effective suppression of unwanted content in regions
where it would otherwise be generated. Additionally, we enabled more precise
suppression in personalized T2I models by optimizing delta vector, which
previous baselines were unable to achieve. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods, both
in terms of quantitative and qualitative metrics.

TL;DR: SC-Lane是一种新颖的3D车道检测框架，通过动态融合坡度特征和保持时间一致性，显著提升了高度估计和车道检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖固定坡度锚点，难以适应多样化的道路几何形状，因此需要一种更鲁棒且自适应的解决方案。

Method: 提出Slope-Aware Adaptive Feature模块动态预测权重，融合多坡度特征；Height Consistency模块确保时间一致性。

Result: 在OpenLane基准测试中，SC-Lane以64.3%的F-score达到最先进性能，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SC-Lane通过自适应坡度特征和时间一致性，为3D车道检测提供了高效且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce SC-Lane, a novel slope-aware and temporally
consistent heightmap estimation framework for 3D lane detection. Unlike
previous approaches that rely on fixed slope anchors, SC-Lane adaptively
determines the fusion of slope-specific height features, improving robustness
to diverse road geometries. To achieve this, we propose a Slope-Aware Adaptive
Feature module that dynamically predicts the appropriate weights from image
cues for integrating multi-slope representations into a unified heightmap.
Additionally, a Height Consistency Module enforces temporal coherence, ensuring
stable and accurate height estimation across consecutive frames, which is
crucial for real-world driving scenarios. To evaluate the effectiveness of
SC-Lane, we employ three standardized metrics-Mean Absolute Error(MAE), Root
Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and threshold-based accuracy-which, although common
in surface and depth estimation, have been underutilized for road height
assessment. Using the LiDAR-derived heightmap dataset introduced in prior work
[20], we benchmark our method under these metrics, thereby establishing a
rigorous standard for future comparisons. Extensive experiments on the OpenLane
benchmark demonstrate that SC-Lane significantly improves both height
estimation and 3D lane detection, achieving state-of-the-art performance with
an F-score of 64.3%, outperforming existing methods by a notable margin. For

TL;DR: NanoControl提出了一种高效的DiT可控文本到图像生成方法，通过LoRA风格控制模块和KV-Context增强机制，显著减少计算开销，同时保持高质量生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DiT可控生成方法依赖ControlNet范式，导致参数和计算成本高。

Method: 采用Flux作为主干网络，设计LoRA风格控制模块和KV-Context增强机制。

Result: 参数仅增加0.024%，GFLOPs增加0.029%，计算开销显著降低，生成质量优越。

Conclusion: NanoControl在高效可控生成领域表现优异，平衡了性能与计算成本。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in
text-to-image synthesis. However, in the domain of controllable text-to-image
generation using DiTs, most existing methods still rely on the ControlNet
paradigm originally designed for UNet-based diffusion models. This paradigm
introduces significant parameter overhead and increased computational costs. To
address these challenges, we propose the Nano Control Diffusion Transformer
(NanoControl), which employs Flux as the backbone network. Our model achieves
state-of-the-art controllable text-to-image generation performance while
incurring only a 0.024\% increase in parameter count and a 0.029\% increase in
GFLOPs, thus enabling highly efficient controllable generation. Specifically,
rather than duplicating the DiT backbone for control, we design a LoRA-style
(low-rank adaptation) control module that directly learns control signals from
raw conditioning inputs. Furthermore, we introduce a KV-Context Augmentation
mechanism that integrates condition-specific key-value information into the
backbone in a simple yet highly effective manner, facilitating deep fusion of
conditional features. Extensive benchmark experiments demonstrate that
NanoControl significantly reduces computational overhead compared to
conventional control approaches, while maintaining superior generation quality
and achieving improved controllability.

TL;DR: STRIDE-QA是一个大规模视觉问答数据集，用于自动驾驶中的时空推理，填补了现有视觉语言模型在动态场景理解上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型基于静态图像-文本对训练，难以满足自动驾驶中动态交通场景的精确时空推理需求。

Method: 构建STRIDE-QA数据集，包含100小时多传感器驾驶数据，提供1600万QA对和285K帧图像，支持对象中心和自我中心推理。

Result: 微调后的视觉语言模型在空间定位和未来运动预测上表现显著提升（55%和28%），而通用模型接近零分。

Conclusion: STRIDE-QA为开发更可靠的自动驾驶视觉语言模型提供了基础。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been applied to autonomous driving to
support decision-making in complex real-world scenarios. However, their
training on static, web-sourced image-text pairs fundamentally limits the
precise spatiotemporal reasoning required to understand and predict dynamic
traffic scenes. We address this critical gap with STRIDE-QA, a large-scale
visual question answering (VQA) dataset for physically grounded reasoning from
an ego-centric perspective. Constructed from 100 hours of multi-sensor driving
data in Tokyo, capturing diverse and challenging conditions, STRIDE-QA is the
largest VQA dataset for spatiotemporal reasoning in urban driving, offering 16
million QA pairs over 285K frames. Grounded by dense, automatically generated
annotations including 3D bounding boxes, segmentation masks, and multi-object
tracks, the dataset uniquely supports both object-centric and ego-centric
reasoning through three novel QA tasks that require spatial localization and
temporal prediction. Our benchmarks demonstrate that existing VLMs struggle
significantly, achieving near-zero scores on prediction consistency. In
contrast, VLMs fine-tuned on STRIDE-QA exhibit dramatic performance gains,
achieving 55% success in spatial localization and 28% consistency in future
motion prediction, compared to near-zero scores from general-purpose VLMs.
Therefore, STRIDE-QA establishes a comprehensive foundation for developing more
reliable VLMs for safety-critical autonomous systems.

Result: 在YouTube-VIS-2019和2021数据集上表现优异，避免了灾难性遗忘，提升了分割和分类性能。

Conclusion: CRISP是持续视频实例分割任务中的有效方法，具有显著性能优势。

Abstract: Continual video instance segmentation demands both the plasticity to absorb
new object categories and the stability to retain previously learned ones, all
while preserving temporal consistency across frames. In this work, we introduce
Contrastive Residual Injection and Semantic Prompting (CRISP), an earlier
attempt tailored to address the instance-wise, category-wise, and task-wise
confusion in continual video instance segmentation. For instance-wise learning,
we model instance tracking and construct instance correlation loss, which
emphasizes the correlation with the prior query space while strengthening the
specificity of the current task query. For category-wise learning, we build an
adaptive residual semantic prompt (ARSP) learning framework, which constructs a
learnable semantic residual prompt pool generated by category text and uses an
adjustive query-prompt matching mechanism to build a mapping relationship
between the query of the current task and the semantic residual prompt.
Meanwhile, a semantic consistency loss based on the contrastive learning is
introduced to maintain semantic coherence between object queries and residual
prompts during incremental training. For task-wise learning, to ensure the
correlation at the inter-task level within the query space, we introduce a
concise yet powerful initialization strategy for incremental prompts. Extensive
experiments on YouTube-VIS-2019 and YouTube-VIS-2021 datasets demonstrate that
CRISP significantly outperforms existing continual segmentation methods in the
long-term continual video instance segmentation task, avoiding catastrophic
forgetting and effectively improving segmentation and classification
performance. The code is available at https://github.com/01upup10/CRISP.

Result: 在DroneVehicle数据集上表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DOD-SA框架有效降低了标注成本，同时提升了检测性能。

Abstract: Infrared-visible object detection has shown great potential in real-world
applications, enabling robust all-day perception by leveraging the
complementary information of infrared and visible images. However, existing
methods typically require dual-modality annotations to output detection results
for both modalities during prediction, which incurs high annotation costs. To
address this challenge, we propose a novel infrared-visible Decoupled Object
Detection framework with Single-modality Annotations, called DOD-SA. The
architecture of DOD-SA is built upon a Single- and Dual-Modality Collaborative
Teacher-Student Network (CoSD-TSNet), which consists of a single-modality
branch (SM-Branch) and a dual-modality decoupled branch (DMD-Branch). The
teacher model generates pseudo-labels for the unlabeled modality,
simultaneously supporting the training of the student model. The collaborative
design enables cross-modality knowledge transfer from the labeled modality to
the unlabeled modality, and facilitates effective SM-to-DMD branch supervision.
To further improve the decoupling ability of the model and the pseudo-label
quality, we introduce a Progressive and Self-Tuning Training Strategy (PaST)
that trains the model in three stages: (1) pretraining SM-Branch, (2) guiding
the learning of DMD-Branch by SM-Branch, and (3) refining DMD-Branch. In
addition, we design a Pseudo Label Assigner (PLA) to align and pair labels
across modalities, explicitly addressing modality misalignment during training.
Extensive experiments on the DroneVehicle dataset demonstrate that our method
outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA).

Conclusion: 该方法降低了依赖CAD系统和人工标注的需求，提升了中小企业在建筑电气布局数字化中的可操作性。

Abstract: Legacy floor plans, often preserved only as scanned documents, remain
essential resources for architecture, urban planning, and facility management
in the construction industry. However, the lack of machine-readable floor plans
render large-scale interpretation both time-consuming and error-prone.
Automated symbol spotting offers a scalable solution by enabling the
identification of service key symbols directly from floor plans, supporting
workflows such as cost estimation, infrastructure maintenance, and regulatory
compliance. This work introduces a labelled Digitised Electrical Layout Plans
(DELP) dataset comprising 45 scanned electrical layout plans annotated with
2,450 instances across 34 distinct service key classes. A systematic evaluation
framework is proposed using pretrained object detection models for DELP
dataset. Among the models benchmarked, YOLOv8 achieves the highest performance
with a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 82.5\%. Using YOLOv8, we develop
SkeySpot, a lightweight, open-source toolkit for real-time detection,
classification, and quantification of electrical symbols. SkeySpot produces
structured, standardised outputs that can be scaled up for interoperable
building information workflows, ultimately enabling compatibility across
downstream applications and regulatory platforms. By lowering dependency on
proprietary CAD systems and reducing manual annotation effort, this approach
makes the digitisation of electrical layouts more accessible to small and
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the construction industry, while supporting
broader goals of standardisation, interoperability, and sustainability in the
built environment.

Result: 编码器层（V1-like层）在图像失真任务中与人类感知判断高度相关，且在中等噪声、模糊和稀疏性水平下表现最佳。

Conclusion: 视觉系统可能针对特定失真和稀疏性水平进行了优化，生物启发模型可无监督学习感知度量。

Abstract: A number of scientists suggested that human visual perception may emerge from
image statistics, shaping efficient neural representations in early vision. In
this work, a bio-inspired architecture that can accommodate several known facts
in the retina-V1 cortex, the PerceptNet, has been end-to-end optimized for
different tasks related to image reconstruction: autoencoding, denoising,
deblurring, and sparsity regularization. Our results show that the encoder
stage (V1-like layer) consistently exhibits the highest correlation with human
perceptual judgments on image distortion despite not using perceptual
information in the initialization or training. This alignment exhibits an
optimum for moderate noise, blur and sparsity. These findings suggest that the
visual system may be tuned to remove those particular levels of distortion with
that level of sparsity and that biologically inspired models can learn
perceptual metrics without human supervision.

Motivation: 现有在线视频超分辨率方法仅利用邻近前一帧进行时间对齐，限制了长时建模能力。状态空间模型（SSMs）具有线性计算复杂度和全局感受野，可提升效率和性能。

Method: TS-Mamba通过构建视频轨迹选择相似token，利用轨迹感知移位Mamba聚合模块（TSMA）聚合token，并设计移位SSMs块补偿扫描损失。提出轨迹感知损失函数监督轨迹生成。

Result: 在三个广泛使用的VSR测试数据集上，TS-Mamba在多数情况下优于六个基准模型，计算复杂度降低22.7%。

Conclusion: TS-Mamba通过长时轨迹建模和低复杂度Mamba，实现了高效的在线视频超分辨率，性能优越且计算复杂度低。

Abstract: Online video super-resolution (VSR) is an important technique for many
real-world video processing applications, which aims to restore the current
high-resolution video frame based on temporally previous frames. Most of the
existing online VSR methods solely employ one neighboring previous frame to
achieve temporal alignment, which limits long-range temporal modeling of
videos. Recently, state space models (SSMs) have been proposed with linear
computational complexity and a global receptive field, which significantly
improve computational efficiency and performance. In this context, this paper
presents a novel online VSR method based on Trajectory-aware Shifted SSMs
(TS-Mamba), leveraging both long-term trajectory modeling and low-complexity
Mamba to achieve efficient spatio-temporal information aggregation.
Specifically, TS-Mamba first constructs the trajectories within a video to
select the most similar tokens from the previous frames. Then, a
Trajectory-aware Shifted Mamba Aggregation (TSMA) module consisting of proposed
shifted SSMs blocks is employed to aggregate the selected tokens. The shifted
SSMs blocks are designed based on Hilbert scannings and corresponding shift
operations to compensate for scanning losses and strengthen the spatial
continuity of Mamba. Additionally, we propose a trajectory-aware loss function
to supervise the trajectory generation, ensuring the accuracy of token
selection when training our model. Extensive experiments on three widely used
VSR test datasets demonstrate that compared with six online VSR benchmark
models, our TS-Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance in most cases and
over 22.7\% complexity reduction (in MACs). The source code for TS-Mamba will
be available at https://github.com.

Conclusion: 领域随机化与AE质量控制结合，可显著减少标记需求，适用于新解剖结构或成像技术的研究。

Abstract: Deep learning segmentation relies heavily on labeled data, but manual
labeling is laborious and time-consuming, especially for volumetric images such
as brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). While recent domain-randomization
techniques alleviate the dependency on labeled data by synthesizing diverse
training images from label maps, they offer limited anatomical variability when
very few label maps are available. Semi-supervised self-training addresses
label scarcity by iteratively incorporating model predictions into the training
set, enabling networks to learn from unlabeled data. In this work, we combine
domain randomization with self-training to train three-dimensional
skull-stripping networks using as little as a single labeled example. First, we
automatically bin voxel intensities, yielding labels we use to synthesize
images for training an initial skull-stripping model. Second, we train a
convolutional autoencoder (AE) on the labeled example and use its
reconstruction error to assess the quality of brain masks predicted for
unlabeled data. Third, we select the top-ranking pseudo-labels to fine-tune the
network, achieving skull-stripping performance on out-of-distribution data that
approaches models trained with more labeled images. We compare AE-based ranking
to consistency-based ranking under test-time augmentation, finding that the AE
approach yields a stronger correlation with segmentation accuracy. Our results
highlight the potential of combining domain randomization and AE-based quality
control to enable effective semi-supervised segmentation from extremely limited
labeled data. This strategy may ease the labeling burden that slows progress in
studies involving new anatomical structures or emerging imaging techniques.

Abstract: Human Action Recognition (HAR) plays a crucial role in healthcare, fitness
tracking, and ambient assisted living technologies. While traditional vision
based HAR systems are effective, they pose privacy concerns. mmWave radar
sensors offer a privacy preserving alternative but present challenges due to
the sparse and noisy nature of their point cloud data. In the literature, three
primary data processing methods: Density-Based Spatial Clustering of
Applications with Noise (DBSCAN), the Hungarian Algorithm, and Kalman Filtering
have been widely used to improve the quality and continuity of radar data.
However, a comprehensive evaluation of these methods, both individually and in
combination, remains lacking. This paper addresses that gap by conducting a
detailed performance analysis of the three methods using the MiliPoint dataset.
We evaluate each method individually, all possible pairwise combinations, and
the combination of all three, assessing both recognition accuracy and
computational cost. Furthermore, we propose targeted enhancements to the
individual methods aimed at improving accuracy. Our results provide crucial
insights into the strengths and trade-offs of each method and their
integrations, guiding future work on mmWave based HAR systems

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: STAS在肺腺癌中与肿瘤复发和生存率降低相关，但大规模诊断存在劳动密集和误诊问题，因此需要利用深度学习模型改进诊断。

Method: 研究收集了多中心组织病理学图像，构建了三个数据集，并提出了STAMP框架，采用双分支架构和Transformer编码器动态选择STAS相关区域。

Result: STAMP在三个数据集上的AUC分别为0.8058、0.8017和0.7928，超越了临床水平。

Conclusion: STAMP框架显著提升了STAS诊断的准确性，具有临床应用潜力。

Abstract: Spread through air spaces (STAS) constitutes a novel invasive pattern in lung
adenocarcinoma (LUAD), associated with tumor recurrence and diminished survival
rates. However, large-scale STAS diagnosis in LUAD remains a labor-intensive
endeavor, compounded by the propensity for oversight and misdiagnosis due to
its distinctive pathological characteristics and morphological features.
Consequently, there is a pressing clinical imperative to leverage deep learning
models for STAS diagnosis. This study initially assembled histopathological
images from STAS patients at the Second Xiangya Hospital and the Third Xiangya
Hospital of Central South University, alongside the TCGA-LUAD cohort. Three
senior pathologists conducted cross-verification annotations to construct the
STAS-SXY, STAS-TXY, and STAS-TCGA datasets. We then propose a multi-pattern
attention-aware multiple instance learning framework, named STAMP, to analyze
and diagnose the presence of STAS across multi-center histopathology images.
Specifically, the dual-branch architecture guides the model to learn
STAS-associated pathological features from distinct semantic spaces.
Transformer-based instance encoding and a multi-pattern attention aggregation
modules dynamically selects regions closely associated with STAS pathology,
suppressing irrelevant noise and enhancing the discriminative power of global
representations. Moreover, a similarity regularization constraint prevents
feature redundancy across branches, thereby improving overall diagnostic
accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrated that STAMP achieved competitive
diagnostic results on STAS-SXY, STAS-TXY and STAS-TCGA, with AUCs of 0.8058,
0.8017, and 0.7928, respectively, surpassing the clinical level.

Method: TweezeEdit采用梯度驱动正则化，通过一致性模型直接注入目标提示语义，正则化整个去噪路径。

Conclusion: TweezeEdit通过优化编辑路径和语义保留机制，实现了高效且一致的图像编辑，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Large-scale pre-trained diffusion models empower users to edit images through
text guidance. However, existing methods often over-align with target prompts
while inadequately preserving source image semantics. Such approaches generate
target images explicitly or implicitly from the inversion noise of the source
images, termed the inversion anchors. We identify this strategy as suboptimal
for semantic preservation and inefficient due to elongated editing paths. We
propose TweezeEdit, a tuning- and inversion-free framework for consistent and
efficient image editing. Our method addresses these limitations by regularizing
the entire denoising path rather than relying solely on the inversion anchors,
ensuring source semantic retention and shortening editing paths. Guided by
gradient-driven regularization, we efficiently inject target prompt semantics
along a direct path using a consistency model. Extensive experiments

Motivation: 现有3D高斯泼溅技术在场景优化中缺乏足够的几何约束，导致高频纹理和锐利边缘区域的模糊重建。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持实时渲染效率的同时，显著改善了高频纹理和锐利边缘的重建质量。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian splatting have significantly improved
real-time novel view synthesis, yet insufficient geometric constraints during
scene optimization often result in blurred reconstructions of fine-grained
details, particularly in regions with high-frequency textures and sharp
discontinuities. To address this, we propose a comprehensive optimization
framework integrating multisample anti-aliasing (MSAA) with dual geometric
constraints. Our system computes pixel colors through adaptive blending of
quadruple subsamples, effectively reducing aliasing artifacts in high-frequency
components. The framework introduces two constraints: (a) an adaptive weighting
strategy that prioritizes under-reconstructed regions through dynamic gradient
analysis, and (b) gradient differential constraints enforcing geometric
regularization at object boundaries. This targeted optimization enables the
model to allocate computational resources preferentially to critical regions
requiring refinement while maintaining global consistency. Extensive
experimental evaluations across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance in detail preservation, particularly in
preserving high-frequency textures and sharp discontinuities, while maintaining
real-time rendering efficiency. Quantitative metrics and perceptual studies
confirm statistically significant improvements over baseline approaches in both
structural similarity (SSIM) and perceptual quality (LPIPS).

Conclusion: SBDE方法有效解决了数据稀缺问题，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Bolt defect detection is critical to ensure the safety of transmission lines.
However, the scarcity of defect images and imbalanced data distributions
significantly limit detection performance. To address this problem, we propose
a segmentationdriven bolt defect editing method (SBDE) to augment the dataset.
First, a bolt attribute segmentation model (Bolt-SAM) is proposed, which
enhances the segmentation of complex bolt attributes through the CLAHE-FFT
Adapter (CFA) and Multipart- Aware Mask Decoder (MAMD), generating high-quality
masks for subsequent editing tasks. Second, a mask optimization module (MOD) is
designed and integrated with the image inpainting model (LaMa) to construct the
bolt defect attribute editing model (MOD-LaMa), which converts normal bolts
into defective ones through attribute editing. Finally, an editing recovery
augmentation (ERA) strategy is proposed to recover and put the edited defect
bolts back into the original inspection scenes and expand the defect detection
dataset. We constructed multiple bolt datasets and conducted extensive
experiments. Experimental results demonstrate that the bolt defect images
generated by SBDE significantly outperform state-of-the-art image editing
models, and effectively improve the performance of bolt defect detection, which
fully verifies the effectiveness and application potential of the proposed
method. The code of the project is available at

Abstract: Estimating human dance motion is a challenging task with various industrial
applications. Recently, many efforts have focused on predicting human dance
motion using either egocentric video or music as input. However, the task of
jointly estimating human motion from both egocentric video and music remains
largely unexplored. In this paper, we aim to develop a new method that predicts
human dance motion from both egocentric video and music. In practice, the
egocentric view often obscures much of the body, making accurate full-pose
estimation challenging. Additionally, incorporating music requires the
generated head and body movements to align well with both visual and musical
inputs. We first introduce EgoAIST++, a new large-scale dataset that combines
both egocentric views and music with more than 36 hours of dancing motion.
Drawing on the success of diffusion models and Mamba on modeling sequences, we
develop an EgoMusic Motion Network with a core Skeleton Mamba that explicitly
captures the skeleton structure of the human body. We illustrate that our
approach is theoretically supportive. Intensive experiments show that our
method clearly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches and generalizes
effectively to real-world data.

Abstract: Visual reasoning is critical for a wide range of computer vision tasks that
go beyond surface-level object detection and classification. Despite notable
advances in relational, symbolic, temporal, causal, and commonsense reasoning,
existing surveys often address these directions in isolation, lacking a unified
analysis and comparison across reasoning types, methodologies, and evaluation
protocols. This survey aims to address this gap by categorizing visual
reasoning into five major types (relational, symbolic, temporal, causal, and
commonsense) and systematically examining their implementation through
architectures such as graph-based models, memory networks, attention
mechanisms, and neuro-symbolic systems. We review evaluation protocols designed
to assess functional correctness, structural consistency, and causal validity,
and critically analyze their limitations in terms of generalizability,
reproducibility, and explanatory power. Beyond evaluation, we identify key open
challenges in visual reasoning, including scalability to complex scenes, deeper
integration of symbolic and neural paradigms, the lack of comprehensive
benchmark datasets, and reasoning under weak supervision. Finally, we outline a
forward-looking research agenda for next-generation vision systems, emphasizing
that bridging perception and reasoning is essential for building transparent,
trustworthy, and cross-domain adaptive AI systems, particularly in critical
domains such as autonomous driving and medical diagnostics.

Conclusion: Med-GLIP-5M数据集和Med-GLIP框架为医学图像定位提供了通用解决方案，并推动了相关下游任务的发展。

Abstract: Medical image grounding aims to align natural language phrases with specific
regions in medical images, serving as a foundational task for intelligent
diagnosis, visual question answering (VQA), and automated report generation
(MRG). However, existing research is constrained by limited modality coverage,
coarse-grained annotations, and the absence of a unified, generalizable
grounding framework. To address these challenges, we construct a large-scale
medical grounding dataset Med-GLIP-5M comprising over 5.3 million region-level
annotations across seven imaging modalities, covering diverse anatomical
structures and pathological findings. The dataset supports both segmentation
and grounding tasks with hierarchical region labels, ranging from organ-level
boundaries to fine-grained lesions. Based on this foundation, we propose
Med-GLIP, a modality-aware grounding framework trained on Med-GLIP-5M. Rather
than relying on explicitly designed expert modules, Med-GLIP implicitly
acquires hierarchical semantic understanding from diverse training data --
enabling it to recognize multi-granularity structures, such as distinguishing
lungs from pneumonia lesions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Med-GLIP
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across multiple grounding
benchmarks. Furthermore, integrating its spatial outputs into downstream tasks,
including medical VQA and report generation, leads to substantial performance
gains. Our dataset will be released soon.

Conclusion: GCRPNet通过创新的模块设计和特征融合策略，显著提升了显著目标检测的精度和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Salient object detection (SOD) in optical remote sensing images (ORSIs) faces
numerous challenges, including significant variations in target scales and low
contrast between targets and the background. Existing methods based on vision
transformers (ViTs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) architectures aim
to leverage both global and local features, but the difficulty in effectively
integrating these heterogeneous features limits their overall performance. To
overcome these limitations, we propose a graph-enhanced contextual and regional
perception network (GCRPNet), which builds upon the Mamba architecture to
simultaneously capture long-range dependencies and enhance regional feature
representation. Specifically, we employ the visual state space (VSS) encoder to
extract multi-scale features. To further achieve deep guidance and enhancement
of these features, we first design a difference-similarity guided hierarchical
graph attention module (DS-HGAM). This module strengthens cross-layer
interaction capabilities between features of different scales while enhancing
the model's structural perception,allowing it to distinguish between foreground
and background more effectively. Then, we design the LEVSS block as the decoder
of GCRPNet. This module integrates our proposed adaptive scanning strategy and
multi-granularity collaborative attention enhancement module (MCAEM). It
performs adaptive patch scanning on feature maps processed via multi-scale
convolutions, thereby capturing rich local region information and enhancing
Mamba's local modeling capability. Extensive experimental results demonstrate
that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating its
effectiveness and superiority.

Conclusion: PSScreen通过创新的双流设计和特征对齐方法，有效提升了多视网膜疾病筛查的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Leveraging multiple partially labeled datasets to train a model for multiple
retinal disease screening reduces the reliance on fully annotated datasets, but
remains challenging due to significant domain shifts across training datasets
from various medical sites, and the label absent issue for partial classes. To
solve these challenges, we propose PSScreen, a novel Partially Supervised
multiple retinal disease Screening model. Our PSScreen consists of two streams
and one learns deterministic features and the other learns probabilistic
features via uncertainty injection. Then, we leverage the textual guidance to
decouple two types of features into disease-wise features and align them via
feature distillation to boost the domain generalization ability. Meanwhile, we
employ pseudo label consistency between two streams to address the label absent
issue and introduce a self-distillation to transfer task-relevant semantics
about known classes from the deterministic to the probabilistic stream to
further enhance the detection performances. Experiments show that our PSScreen
significantly enhances the detection performances on six retinal diseases and
the normal state averagely and achieves state-of-the-art results on both
in-domain and out-of-domain datasets. Codes are available at

Conclusion: 实时工具跟踪AR导航在手术中具有显著优势，未来可进一步优化和推广。

Abstract: Augmented Reality (AR) surgical navigation systems are emerging as the next
generation of intraoperative surgical guidance, promising to overcome
limitations of traditional navigation systems. However, known issues with AR
depth perception due to vergence-accommodation conflict and occlusion handling
limitations of the currently commercially available display technology present
acute challenges in surgical settings where precision is paramount. This study
presents a novel methodology for utilizing AR guidance to register anatomical
targets and provide real-time instrument navigation using placement of
simulated external ventricular drain catheters on a phantom model as the
clinical scenario. The system registers target positions to the patient through
a novel surface tracing method and uses real-time infrared tool tracking to aid
in catheter placement, relying only on the onboard sensors of the Microsoft
HoloLens 2. A group of intended users performed the procedure of simulated
insertions under two AR guidance conditions: static in-situ visualization,
where planned trajectories are overlaid directly onto the patient anatomy, and
real-time tool-tracking guidance, where live feedback of the catheter's pose is
provided relative to the plan. Following the insertion tests, computed
tomography scans of the phantom models were acquired, allowing for evaluation
of insertion accuracy, target deviation, angular error, and depth precision.
System Usability Scale surveys assessed user experience and cognitive workload.
Tool-tracking guidance improved performance metrics across all accuracy
measures and was preferred by users in subjective evaluations. A free copy of

Motivation: 现有OOD检测方法因依赖有限且不匹配的异常样本，导致语义监督不足，性能不佳。

Method: RAP通过检索外部知识动态增强模型提示，训练时生成异常描述词，测试时实时更新提示。

Result: 在ImageNet-1k数据集上，RAP在1-shot OOD检测中FPR95降低7.05%，AUROC提升1.71%。

Conclusion: RAP通过动态增强语义监督，显著提升OOD检测性能，验证了其模块的有效性。

Abstract: Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection is crucial for the reliable deployment of
machine learning models in-the-wild, enabling accurate identification of test
samples that differ from the training data distribution. Existing methods rely
on auxiliary outlier samples or in-distribution (ID) data to generate outlier
information for training, but due to limited outliers and their mismatch with
real test OOD samples, they often fail to provide sufficient semantic
supervision, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose a
novel OOD detection method called Retrieval-Augmented Prompt (RAP). RAP
augments a pre-trained vision-language model's prompts by retrieving external
knowledge, offering enhanced semantic supervision for OOD detection. During
training, RAP retrieves descriptive words for outliers based on joint
similarity with external textual knowledge and uses them to augment the model's
OOD prompts. During testing, RAP dynamically updates OOD prompts in real-time
based on the encountered OOD samples, enabling the model to rapidly adapt to
the test environment. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that RAP achieves
state-of-the-art performance on large-scale OOD detection benchmarks. For
example, in 1-shot OOD detection on the ImageNet-1k dataset, RAP reduces the
average FPR95 by 7.05% and improves the AUROC by 1.71% compared to previous
methods. Additionally, comprehensive ablation studies validate the
effectiveness of each module and the underlying motivations of our approach.

Motivation: 解决PTQ性能下降和QAT计算资源消耗大的问题，提出一种高效且通用的量化方法。

Method: 选择输出差异小的层进行QAT微调，其余层采用PTQ，以减少量化误差传播。

Result: 在多种3D感知任务中表现优于QAT，量化精度提升且计算资源需求降低。

Conclusion: PTQAT是一种高效通用的量化方法，适用于不同架构和任务，显著提升性能。

Abstract: Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) and Quantization-Aware Training (QAT)
represent two mainstream model quantization approaches. However, PTQ often
leads to unacceptable performance degradation in quantized models, while QAT
imposes substantial GPU memory requirements and extended training time due to
weight fine-tuning.In this paper, we propose PTQAT, a novel general hybrid
quantization algorithm for the efficient deployment of 3D perception networks.
To address the speed accuracy trade-off between PTQ and QAT, our method selects
critical layers for QAT fine-tuning and performs PTQ on the remaining layers.
Contrary to intuition, fine-tuning the layers with smaller output discrepancies
before and after quantization, rather than those with larger discrepancies,
actually leads to greater improvements in the model's quantization accuracy.
This means we better compensate for quantization errors during their
propagation, rather than addressing them at the point where they occur. The
proposed PTQAT achieves similar performance to QAT with more efficiency by
freezing nearly 50% of quantifiable layers. Additionally, PTQAT is a universal
quantization method that supports various quantization bit widths (4 bits) as
well as different model architectures, including CNNs and Transformers. The
experimental results on nuScenes across diverse 3D perception tasks, including
object detection, semantic segmentation, and occupancy prediction, show that
our method consistently outperforms QAT-only baselines. Notably, it achieves
0.2%-0.9% NDS and 0.3%-1.0% mAP gains in object detection, 0.3%-2.0% mIoU gains
in semantic segmentation and occupancy prediction while fine-tuning fewer
weights.

Motivation: 当前音频驱动的说话头部视频生成方法因缺乏显式发音先验（如解剖学指导）而常产生运动模糊和唇部抖动，影响视频质量。

Method: HM-Talker采用混合运动表示，结合隐式和显式运动线索（如动作单元AUs），并通过跨模态解缠模块（CMDM）和混合运动建模模块（HMMM）优化特征提取与泛化能力。

Result: 实验表明，HM-Talker在视觉质量和唇部同步准确性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: HM-Talker通过混合运动表示和身份无关学习，显著提升了说话头部视频的生成质量，适用于多样化身份。

Abstract: Audio-driven talking head video generation enhances user engagement in
human-computer interaction. However, current methods frequently produce videos
with motion blur and lip jitter, primarily due to their reliance on implicit
modeling of audio-facial motion correlations--an approach lacking explicit
articulatory priors (i.e., anatomical guidance for speech-related facial
movements). To overcome this limitation, we propose HM-Talker, a novel
framework for generating high-fidelity, temporally coherent talking heads.
HM-Talker leverages a hybrid motion representation combining both implicit and
explicit motion cues. Explicit cues use Action Units (AUs), anatomically
defined facial muscle movements, alongside implicit features to minimize
phoneme-viseme misalignment. Specifically, our Cross-Modal Disentanglement
Module (CMDM) extracts complementary implicit/explicit motion features while
predicting AUs directly from audio input aligned to visual cues. To mitigate
identity-dependent biases in explicit features and enhance cross-subject
generalization, we introduce the Hybrid Motion Modeling Module (HMMM). This
module dynamically merges randomly paired implicit/explicit features, enforcing
identity-agnostic learning. Together, these components enable robust lip
synchronization across diverse identities, advancing personalized talking head
synthesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate HM-Talker's superiority over
state-of-the-art methods in visual quality and lip-sync accuracy.

Abstract: Foundational models have achieved significant success in diverse domains of
computer vision. They learn general representations that are easily
transferable to tasks not seen during training. One such foundational model is
Segment anything model (SAM), which can accurately segment objects in images.
We propose adapting the SAM encoder via fine-tuning for remote sensing change

Abstract: Referring-based Video Object Segmentation is a multimodal problem that
requires producing fine-grained segmentation results guided by external cues.
Traditional approaches to this task typically involve training specialized
models, which come with high computational complexity and manual annotation
effort. Recent advances in vision-language foundation models open a promising
direction toward training-free approaches. Several studies have explored
leveraging these general-purpose models for fine-grained segmentation,
achieving performance comparable to that of fully supervised, task-specific
models. However, existing methods rely on fixed pipelines that lack the
flexibility needed to adapt to the dynamic nature of the task. To address this
limitation, we propose Multi-Modal Agent, a novel agentic system designed to
solve this task in a more flexible and adaptive manner. Specifically, our
method leverages the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to
generate dynamic workflows tailored to each input. This adaptive procedure
iteratively interacts with a set of specialized tools designed for low-level
tasks across different modalities to identify the target object described by
the multimodal cues. Our agentic approach demonstrates clear improvements over
prior methods on two multimodal-conditioned VOS tasks: RVOS and Ref-AVS.

Motivation: 当前缺乏细粒度的评估框架来测试MLLMs在理解复杂人类意图和提供共情、上下文感知反馈方面的能力。

Method: 引入HumanSense基准，结合多模态输入（视觉、音频、文本），采用多阶段、模态渐进强化学习提升推理能力。

Result: 补充音频和文本信息显著提升性能，全模态模型表现更优；推理能力是关键，通过强化学习实现显著改进。

Conclusion: HumanSense为MLLMs的评估和改进提供了重要工具，推理能力是提升交互质量的核心。

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show immense promise for
achieving truly human-like interactions, progress is hindered by the lack of
fine-grained evaluation frameworks for human-centered scenarios, encompassing
both the understanding of complex human intentions and the provision of
empathetic, context-aware responses. Here we introduce HumanSense, a
comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the human-centered perception and
interaction capabilities of MLLMs, with a particular focus on deep
understanding of extended multimodal contexts and the formulation of rational
feedback. Our evaluation reveals that leading MLLMs still have considerable
room for improvement, particularly for advanced interaction-oriented tasks.
Supplementing visual input with audio and text information yields substantial
improvements, and Omni-modal models show advantages on these tasks.
Furthermore, we argue that appropriate feedback stems from a contextual
analysis of the interlocutor's needs and emotions, with reasoning ability
serving as the key to unlocking it. Accordingly, we employ a multi-stage,
modality-progressive reinforcement learning to enhance the reasoning abilities
of an Omni model, achieving substantial gains on evaluation results.
Additionally, we observe that successful reasoning processes exhibit highly
consistent thought patterns. By designing corresponding prompts, we also
enhance the performance of non-reasoning models in a training-free manner.

*Yixing Liu,Minggui Teng,Yifei Xia,Peiqi Duan,Boxin Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EvTurb是一个利用高速事件流解耦模糊和倾斜效应的湍流去除框架，通过两步事件引导网络实现，并在真实数据集TurbEvent上表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大气湍流导致图像模糊和几何倾斜失真，现有方法难以解决这一高度不适定问题。

Method: EvTurb通过事件积分减少模糊，利用事件流方差图消除倾斜失真，采用两步事件引导网络。

Result: 实验表明EvTurb在计算效率下优于现有方法。

Conclusion: EvTurb有效解决了湍流引起的图像失真问题，并在真实数据集中表现优异。

Abstract: Atmospheric turbulence degrades image quality by introducing blur and
geometric tilt distortions, posing significant challenges to downstream
computer vision tasks. Existing single-image and multi-frame methods struggle
with the highly ill-posed nature of this problem due to the compositional
complexity of turbulence-induced distortions. To address this, we propose
EvTurb, an event guided turbulence removal framework that leverages high-speed
event streams to decouple blur and tilt effects. EvTurb decouples blur and tilt
effects by modeling event-based turbulence formation, specifically through a
novel two-step event-guided network: event integrals are first employed to
reduce blur in the coarse outputs. This is followed by employing a variance
map, derived from raw event streams, to eliminate the tilt distortion for the
refined outputs. Additionally, we present TurbEvent, the first real-captured
dataset featuring diverse turbulence scenarios. Experimental results
demonstrate that EvTurb surpasses state-of-the-art methods while maintaining
computational efficiency.

### [59] [Towards Powerful and Practical Patch Attacks for 2D Object Detection in Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10600)
*Yuxin Cao,Yedi Zhang,Wentao He,Yifan Liao,Yan Xiao,Chang Li,Zhiyong Huang,Jin Song Dong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种针对自动驾驶中2D目标检测的强大且实用的对抗性补丁攻击框架P$^3$A，通过新指标PASR和改进的损失函数LCSL，提升了攻击效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于迁移的黑盒攻击方法因评价指标和低分辨率数据的局限性，在实际攻击场景中效果不佳，亟需一种更有效的攻击框架。

Method: 提出P$^3$A框架，包括新指标PASR、损失函数LCSL和数据预处理步骤PSPP，以优化高分辨率数据的攻击效果。

Result: 实验表明P$^3$A在未见模型和高分辨率数据集上优于现有攻击方法，无论是基于PASR还是传统mAP指标。

Conclusion: P$^3$A显著提升了对抗性补丁攻击的实用性和效果，为自动驾驶系统的安全性研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Learning-based autonomous driving systems remain critically vulnerable to
adversarial patches, posing serious safety and security risks in their
real-world deployment. Black-box attacks, notable for their high attack success
rate without model knowledge, are especially concerning, with their
transferability extensively studied to reduce computational costs compared to
query-based attacks. Previous transferability-based black-box attacks typically
adopt mean Average Precision (mAP) as the evaluation metric and design training
loss accordingly. However, due to the presence of multiple detected bounding
boxes and the relatively lenient Intersection over Union (IoU) thresholds, the
attack effectiveness of these approaches is often overestimated, resulting in
reduced success rates in practical attacking scenarios. Furthermore, patches
trained on low-resolution data often fail to maintain effectiveness on
high-resolution images, limiting their transferability to autonomous driving
datasets. To fill this gap, we propose P$^3$A, a Powerful and Practical Patch
Attack framework for 2D object detection in autonomous driving, specifically
optimized for high-resolution datasets. First, we introduce a novel metric,
Practical Attack Success Rate (PASR), to more accurately quantify attack
effectiveness with greater relevance for pedestrian safety. Second, we present
a tailored Localization-Confidence Suppression Loss (LCSL) to improve attack
transferability under PASR. Finally, to maintain the transferability for
high-resolution datasets, we further incorporate the Probabilistic
Scale-Preserving Padding (PSPP) into the patch attack pipeline as a data
preprocessing step. Extensive experiments show that P$^3$A outperforms
state-of-the-art attacks on unseen models and unseen high-resolution datasets,
both under the proposed practical IoU-based evaluation metric and the previous
mAP-based metrics.

*Daejune Choi,Youchan No,Jinhyung Lee,Duksu Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种轻量级上采样模块FGA，通过频率引导注意力机制提升单图像超分辨率性能，减少伪影并保留高频细节。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统上采样方法（如子像素卷积）效率高但难以重建高频细节且易引入伪影，FGA旨在解决这些问题。

Method: FGA结合了基于傅里叶特征的多层感知机、跨分辨率相关性注意力层和频域L1损失，实现频率编码、空间对齐和频谱保真。

Result: FGA仅增加0.3M参数，在五种超分辨率骨干网络上平均PSNR提升0.12~0.14 dB，频域一致性提升29%。

Conclusion: FGA在减少伪影和保留细节方面表现优异，是传统上采样方法的实用替代方案。

Abstract: We propose Frequency-Guided Attention (FGA), a lightweight upsampling module
for single image super-resolution. Conventional upsamplers, such as Sub-Pixel
Convolution, are efficient but frequently fail to reconstruct high-frequency
details and introduce aliasing artifacts. FGA addresses these issues by
integrating (1) a Fourier feature-based Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) for
positional frequency encoding, (2) a cross-resolution Correlation Attention
Layer for adaptive spatial alignment, and (3) a frequency-domain L1 loss for
spectral fidelity supervision. Adding merely 0.3M parameters, FGA consistently
enhances performance across five diverse super-resolution backbones in both
lightweight and full-capacity scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate
average PSNR gains of 0.12~0.14 dB and improved frequency-domain consistency by
up to 29%, particularly evident on texture-rich datasets. Visual and spectral
evaluations confirm FGA's effectiveness in reducing aliasing and preserving
fine details, establishing it as a practical, scalable alternative to
traditional upsampling methods.

### [61] [FIND-Net -- Fourier-Integrated Network with Dictionary Kernels for Metal Artifact Reduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10617)
*Farid Tasharofi,Fuxin Fan,Melika Qahqaie,Mareike Thies,Andreas Maier*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FIND-Net是一种新型金属伪影减少（MAR）框架，结合频域和空间域处理，显著减少伪影并保留结构细节。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 金属伪影严重影响CT图像质量，现有深度学习方法难以同时抑制伪影和保留结构细节。

Method: FIND-Net整合快速傅里叶卷积（FFC）层和可训练高斯滤波，在空间和频域中处理MAR任务。

Result: 在合成数据集上，FIND-Net显著优于现有方法（MAE降低3.07%，SSIM增加0.18%，PSNR提升0.90%），并在真实临床CT扫描中验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: FIND-Net在MAR任务中表现出色，具有更好的结构保留和临床适用性。

Abstract: Metal artifacts, caused by high-density metallic implants in computed
tomography (CT) imaging, severely degrade image quality, complicating diagnosis
and treatment planning. While existing deep learning algorithms have achieved
notable success in Metal Artifact Reduction (MAR), they often struggle to
suppress artifacts while preserving structural details. To address this
challenge, we propose FIND-Net (Fourier-Integrated Network with Dictionary
Kernels), a novel MAR framework that integrates frequency and spatial domain
processing to achieve superior artifact suppression and structural
preservation. FIND-Net incorporates Fast Fourier Convolution (FFC) layers and
trainable Gaussian filtering, treating MAR as a hybrid task operating in both
spatial and frequency domains. This approach enhances global contextual
understanding and frequency selectivity, effectively reducing artifacts while
maintaining anatomical structures. Experiments on synthetic datasets show that
FIND-Net achieves statistically significant improvements over state-of-the-art
MAR methods, with a 3.07% MAE reduction, 0.18% SSIM increase, and 0.90% PSNR
improvement, confirming robustness across varying artifact complexities.
Furthermore, evaluations on real-world clinical CT scans confirm FIND-Net's
ability to minimize modifications to clean anatomical regions while effectively
suppressing metal-induced distortions. These findings highlight FIND-Net's
potential for advancing MAR performance, offering superior structural
preservation and improved clinical applicability. Code is available at

### [62] [Increasing the Utility of Synthetic Images through Chamfer Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10631)
*Nicola Dall'Asen,Xiaofeng Zhang,Reyhane Askari Hemmat,Melissa Hall,Jakob Verbeek,Adriana Romero-Soriano,Michal Drozdzal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Chamfer Guidance方法，通过少量真实样本提升生成图像的多样性和质量，减少计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决生成模型在提升生成质量时牺牲多样性的问题，同时考虑合成与真实数据的分布差异。

Method: 利用少量真实样本（如2或32张）指导生成过程，无需训练，优化生成多样性和质量。

Result: 在ImageNet-1k和多样性基准测试中表现优异，下游分类任务准确率提升高达16%。

Conclusion: Chamfer Guidance是一种高效的方法，显著提升生成数据的实用性和计算效率。

Abstract: Conditional image generative models hold considerable promise to produce
infinite amounts of synthetic training data. Yet, recent progress in generation
quality has come at the expense of generation diversity, limiting the utility
of these models as a source of synthetic training data. Although guidance-based
approaches have been introduced to improve the utility of generated data by
focusing on quality or diversity, the (implicit or explicit) utility functions
oftentimes disregard the potential distribution shift between synthetic and
real data. In this work, we introduce Chamfer Guidance: a training-free
guidance approach which leverages a handful of real exemplar images to
characterize the quality and diversity of synthetic data. We show that by
leveraging the proposed Chamfer Guidance, we can boost the diversity of the
generations w.r.t. a dataset of real images while maintaining or improving the
generation quality on ImageNet-1k and standard geo-diversity benchmarks. Our
approach achieves state-of-the-art few-shot performance with as little as 2
exemplar real images, obtaining 96.4\% in terms of precision, and 86.4\% in
terms of distributional coverage, which increase to 97.5\% and 92.7\%,
respectively, when using 32 real images. We showcase the benefits of the
Chamfer Guidance generation by training downstream image classifiers on
synthetic data, achieving accuracy boost of up to 15\% for in-distribution over
the baselines, and up to 16\% in out-of-distribution. Furthermore, our approach
does not require using the unconditional model, and thus obtains a 31\%
reduction in FLOPs w.r.t. classifier-free-guidance-based approaches at sampling
time.

*Hosam Elgendy,Ahmed Sharshar,Ahmed Aboeitta,Mohsen Guizani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ChatENV是一个交互式视觉语言模型，结合卫星图像和传感器数据，用于环境监测和推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型忽视环境传感器的因果信号，依赖单一来源的标注，缺乏交互式场景推理能力。

Method: 构建包含177k图像和152k时间对的多样化数据集，利用GPT-4o和Gemini 2.0标注，并通过LoRA微调Qwen-2.5-VL模型。

Result: ChatENV在时间和假设推理中表现优异（BERT-F1 0.903），优于现有时间模型，支持交互式分析。

Conclusion: ChatENV是一个基于传感器感知的强大环境监测工具。

Abstract: Understanding environmental changes from aerial imagery is vital for climate
resilience, urban planning, and ecosystem monitoring. Yet, current vision
language models (VLMs) overlook causal signals from environmental sensors, rely
on single-source captions prone to stylistic bias, and lack interactive
scenario-based reasoning. We present ChatENV, the first interactive VLM that
jointly reasons over satellite image pairs and real-world sensor data. Our
framework: (i) creates a 177k-image dataset forming 152k temporal pairs across
62 land-use classes in 197 countries with rich sensor metadata (e.g.,
temperature, PM10, CO); (ii) annotates data using GPT- 4o and Gemini 2.0 for
stylistic and semantic diversity; and (iii) fine-tunes Qwen-2.5-VL using
efficient Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) adapters for chat purposes. ChatENV
achieves strong performance in temporal and "what-if" reasoning (e.g., BERT-F1
0.903) and rivals or outperforms state-of-the-art temporal models, while
supporting interactive scenario-based analysis. This positions ChatENV as a
powerful tool for grounded, sensor-aware environmental monitoring.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究视觉编码器对图像采集和处理的细微参数的敏感性，及其对语义预测的影响。

Method: 分析图像采集过程中的参数和细微变换，研究其在视觉表示中的编码方式及其对语义预测的影响。

Result: 发现这些参数被系统地编码在视觉表示中，且对语义预测有显著影响，取决于与语义标签的相关性。

Conclusion: 图像采集和处理的细微参数对视觉编码器的语义预测有重要影响，需进一步研究其机制。

Abstract: Prior work has analyzed the robustness of visual encoders to image
transformations and corruptions, particularly in cases where such alterations
are not seen during training. When this occurs, they introduce a form of
distribution shift at test time, often leading to performance degradation. The
primary focus has been on severe corruptions that, when applied aggressively,
distort useful signals necessary for accurate semantic predictions.
  We take a different perspective by analyzing parameters of the image
acquisition process and transformations that may be subtle or even
imperceptible to the human eye. We find that such parameters are systematically
encoded in the learned visual representations and can be easily recovered. More
strikingly, their presence can have a profound impact, either positively or
negatively, on semantic predictions. This effect depends on whether there is a
strong correlation or anti-correlation between semantic labels and these
acquisition-based or processing-based labels. Our code and data are available
at: https://github.com/ryan-caesar-ramos/visual-encoder-traces

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合姿态估计和BLSTM神经网络的跛行检测方法，显著优于传统手工特征方法，准确率达85%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统跛行检测依赖手工设计的运动特征，效率低且不灵活。本研究旨在通过自动学习运动特征，提高检测效率和准确性。

Method: 使用T-LEAP姿态估计模型提取奶牛行走视频中9个关键点的运动轨迹，输入BLSTM分类器进行二元跛行分类。

Result: BLSTM分类器准确率达85%，优于传统方法的80%，且仅需1秒视频数据即可检测。

Conclusion: 结合姿态估计和BLSTM的方法在跛行检测中表现优异，适用于小数据集和短序列。

Abstract: This study presents a lameness detection approach that combines pose
estimation and Bidirectional Long-Short-Term Memory (BLSTM) neural networks.
Combining pose-estimation and BLSTMs classifier offers the following
advantages: markerless pose-estimation, elimination of manual feature
engineering by learning temporal motion features from the keypoint
trajectories, and working with short sequences and small training datasets.
Motion sequences of nine keypoints (located on the cows' hooves, head and back)
were extracted from videos of walking cows with the T-LEAP pose estimation
model. The trajectories of the keypoints were then used as an input to a BLSTM
classifier that was trained to perform binary lameness classification. Our
method significantly outperformed an established method that relied on
manually-designed locomotion features: our best architecture achieved a
classification accuracy of 85%, against 80% accuracy for the feature-based
approach. Furthermore, we showed that our BLSTM classifier could detect
lameness with as little as one second of video data.

*Xiao Shi,Yangjun Ou,Zhenzhong Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为SemPT的新框架，通过利用跨类别的共享属性级知识，解决了视觉迁移学习中未见类别的泛化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉迁移学习中未见类别的泛化是一个具有挑战性的任务，现有方法依赖稀疏类别标签或LLM生成的描述，导致知识表示碎片化。

Method: SemPT采用两步提示策略，提取共享视觉属性并生成属性级描述，通过视觉引导加权减少噪声，并联合对齐图像嵌入与文本嵌入。

Result: 在15个基准数据集上的实验表明，SemPT在多种设置下达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: SemPT通过属性级知识增强和动态推理选择，有效平衡了已知类别的区分性和未见类别的可迁移性。

Abstract: Visual transfer learning for unseen categories presents an active research
topic yet a challenging task, due to the inherent conflict between preserving
category-specific representations and acquiring transferable knowledge.
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) pre-trained on large amounts of image-text pairs
offer a promising solution. However, existing prompt tuning methods rely on
sparse category labels or disparate LLM-generated descriptions, which fragment
knowledge representation and hinder transferability. To address this
limitation, we introduce Semantic Prompt Tuning (SemPT), a novel framework that
tackles the generalization challenge by leveraging shared attribute-level
knowledge across categories. Specifically, SemPT adopts a two-step prompting
strategy to guide LLM in extracting shared visual attributes and generating
attribute-level descriptions, capturing transferable semantic cues beyond
labels while ensuring coherent structure. Then, visually guided weighting is
applied to the embeddings of attribute-level descriptions to reduce noise from
irrelevant attributes and enhance the text embeddings. Additionally, image
embeddings are jointly aligned with both label and attribute-enhanced text
embeddings, balancing discrimination for seen categories and transferability to
unseen ones. Considering the availability of category exposure, our inference
dynamically selects between standard label embeddings for seen categories and
attribute-enhanced embeddings for unseen ones to ensure effective adaptation.
Extensive experiments on 15 benchmark datasets demonstrate that SemPT achieves
state-of-the-art performance across various settings, including base-to-novel
generalization, cross-dataset transfer, cross-domain transfer, and few-shot
learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将多模态数据混合训练，但缺乏统一基准导致训练与测试不一致，引发性能退化。

Method: 引入UniBench300统一基准，采用序列化整合方法，并探索持续学习在整合过程中的应用。

Result: 实验表明UniBench300显著提升效率（减少27%时间），持续学习能稳定整合过程，性能退化与网络容量负相关。

Conclusion: UniBench300和序列化整合方法有效解决多模态任务中的不一致问题，持续学习为未来研究提供新方向。

Abstract: Unifying multiple multi-modal visual object tracking (MMVOT) tasks draws
increasing attention due to the complementary nature of different modalities in
building robust tracking systems. Existing practices mix all data sensor types
in a single training procedure, structuring a parallel paradigm from the
data-centric perspective and aiming for a global optimum on the joint
distribution of the involved tasks. However, the absence of a unified benchmark
where all types of data coexist forces evaluations on separated benchmarks,
causing \textit{inconsistency} between training and testing, thus leading to
performance \textit{degradation}. To address these issues, this work advances
in two aspects: \ding{182} A unified benchmark, coined as UniBench300, is
introduced to bridge the inconsistency by incorporating multiple task data,
reducing inference passes from three to one and cutting time consumption by
27\%. \ding{183} The unification process is reformulated in a serial format,
progressively integrating new tasks. In this way, the performance degradation
can be specified as knowledge forgetting of previous tasks, which naturally
aligns with the philosophy of continual learning (CL), motivating further
exploration of injecting CL into the unification process. Extensive experiments
conducted on two baselines and four benchmarks demonstrate the significance of
UniBench300 and the superiority of CL in supporting a stable unification
process. Moreover, while conducting dedicated analyses, the performance
degradation is found to be negatively correlated with network capacity.
Additionally, modality discrepancies contribute to varying degradation levels
across tasks (RGBT > RGBD > RGBE in MMVOT), offering valuable insights for
future multi-modal vision research. Source codes and the proposed benchmark is
available at \textit{https://github.com/Zhangyong-Tang/UniBench300}.

Motivation: 解决LVLM在细粒度地址定位中的不足，尤其是街景VQA数据仅提供微观视觉线索导致性能不佳的问题。

Method: 提出两阶段训练协议：跨视图对齐调整和地址定位调整，结合卫星图像和街景图像，并引入自动标签生成机制。

Result: 在Pittsburgh和San Francisco数据集上，AddressVLM的平均地址定位准确率分别提高了9%和12%。

Conclusion: AddressVLM通过跨视图对齐和两阶段训练，显著提升了细粒度地址定位的性能。

Abstract: Large visual language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance
in coarse-grained geo-localization at the country or city level, but they
struggle with fine-grained street-level localization within urban areas. In
this paper, we explore integrating city-wide address localization capabilities
into LVLMs, facilitating flexible address-related question answering using
street-view images. A key challenge is that the street-view visual
question-and-answer (VQA) data provides only microscopic visual cues, leading
to subpar performance in fine-tuned models. To tackle this issue, we
incorporate perspective-invariant satellite images as macro cues and propose
cross-view alignment tuning including a satellite-view and street-view image
grafting mechanism, along with an automatic label generation mechanism. Then
LVLM's global understanding of street distribution is enhanced through
cross-view matching. Our proposed model, named AddressVLM, consists of
two-stage training protocols: cross-view alignment tuning and address
localization tuning. Furthermore, we have constructed two street-view VQA
datasets based on image address localization datasets from Pittsburgh and San
Francisco. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that AddressVLM
outperforms counterpart LVLMs by over 9% and 12% in average address
localization accuracy on these two datasets, respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 构建一个不与现有公开数据集身份重叠的高质量人脸数据集，以训练更优的人脸识别模型。

Method: 通过清理HSFace数据集、使用MoE策略验证身份、数据增强、Stable Diffusion生成合成身份，并采用课程学习策略优化训练。

Result: 构建的数据集在10K、20K和100K身份规模上提升了模型性能，并在竞赛中获得第一名。

Conclusion: 混合真实与合成数据的策略能高效构建高质量数据集，提升人脸识别模型性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we present our approach to the DataCV ICCV Challenge, which
centers on building a high-quality face dataset to train a face recognition
model. The constructed dataset must not contain identities overlapping with any
existing public face datasets. To handle this challenge, we begin with a
thorough cleaning of the baseline HSFace dataset, identifying and removing
mislabeled or inconsistent identities through a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
strategy combining face embedding clustering and GPT-4o-assisted verification.
We retain the largest consistent identity cluster and apply data augmentation
up to a fixed number of images per identity. To further diversify the dataset,
we generate synthetic identities using Stable Diffusion with prompt
engineering. As diffusion models are computationally intensive, we generate
only one reference image per identity and efficiently expand it using Vec2Face,
which rapidly produces 49 identity-consistent variants. This hybrid approach
fuses GAN-based and diffusion-based samples, enabling efficient construction of
a diverse and high-quality dataset. To address the high visual similarity among
synthetic identities, we adopt a curriculum learning strategy by placing them
early in the training schedule, allowing the model to progress from easier to
harder samples. Our final dataset contains 50 images per identity, and all
newly generated identities are checked with mainstream face datasets to ensure
no identity leakage. Our method achieves \textbf{1st place} in the competition,
and experimental results show that our dataset improves model performance
across 10K, 20K, and 100K identity scales. Code is available at

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为HyperTea的方法，结合全局和局部时间视角，利用超图神经网络（HGNNs）提升移动红外小目标检测（MIRSTD）的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 移动红外小目标检测因目标尺寸小、强度弱和运动模式复杂而极具挑战性，现有方法仅建模低阶特征相关性且局限于单一时间尺度。

Method: HyperTea包含三个模块：全局时间增强模块（GTEM）、局部时间增强模块（LTEM）和时间对齐模块（TAM），结合CNN、RNN和HGNN技术。

Result: 在DAUB和IRDST数据集上实现了最先进的检测性能。

Conclusion: HyperTea首次将CNN、RNN和HGNN结合用于MIRSTD，显著提升了检测效果。

Abstract: In practical application scenarios, moving infrared small target detection
(MIRSTD) remains highly challenging due to the target's small size, weak
intensity, and complex motion pattern. Existing methods typically only model
low-order correlations between feature nodes and perform feature extraction and
enhancement within a single temporal scale. Although hypergraphs have been
widely used for high-order correlation learning, they have received limited
attention in MIRSTD. To explore the potential of hypergraphs and enhance
multi-timescale feature representation, we propose HyperTea, which integrates
global and local temporal perspectives to effectively model high-order
spatiotemporal correlations of features. HyperTea consists of three modules:
the global temporal enhancement module (GTEM) realizes global temporal context
enhancement through semantic aggregation and propagation; the local temporal
enhancement module (LTEM) is designed to capture local motion patterns between
adjacent frames and then enhance local temporal context; additionally, we
further develop a temporal alignment module (TAM) to address potential
cross-scale feature misalignment. To our best knowledge, HyperTea is the first
work to integrate convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural
networks (RNNs), and hypergraph neural networks (HGNNs) for MIRSTD,
significantly improving detection performance. Experiments on DAUB and IRDST
demonstrate its state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. Our source codes are

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胎儿脑MRI的T2 mapping在0.55T中场强下具有潜力，但现有方法因运动伪影和长扫描时间而受限。

Method: 结合隐式神经表示和物理驱动的正则化，联合重建多TE数据，共享信息并保持解剖和T2定量准确性。

Result: 在模拟胎儿脑和成人数据集上表现优异，首次实现了0.55T下的胎儿T2 mapping。

Conclusion: 该方法通过利用解剖冗余，减少了每TE所需的扫描次数，具有潜在临床应用价值。

Abstract: T2 mapping in fetal brain MRI has the potential to improve characterization
of the developing brain, especially at mid-field (0.55T), where T2 decay is
slower. However, this is challenging as fetal MRI acquisition relies on
multiple motion-corrupted stacks of thick slices, requiring slice-to-volume
reconstruction (SVR) to estimate a high-resolution (HR) 3D volume. Currently,
T2 mapping involves repeated acquisitions of these stacks at each echo time
(TE), leading to long scan times and high sensitivity to motion. We tackle this
challenge with a method that jointly reconstructs data across TEs, addressing
severe motion. Our approach combines implicit neural representations with a
physics-informed regularization that models T2 decay, enabling information
sharing across TEs while preserving anatomical and quantitative T2 fidelity. We

*Mengyang Zhao,Teng Fu,Haiyang Yu,Ke Niu,Bin Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IADGPT是一个统一框架，用于少样本工业异常检测（FS-IAD），通过三阶段训练策略模拟人类学习过程，结合语言输出和注意力图实现异常定位和推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）缺乏工业知识和推理能力，无法达到专业质检员的水平。

Method: 提出三阶段渐进训练策略：前两阶段获取基础工业知识和差异意识，第三阶段基于上下文学习实现少样本泛化。

Result: IADGPT在异常检测、定位和推理方面表现优异，实验验证了其性能提升。

Conclusion: IADGPT通过模拟人类学习过程，显著提升了FS-IAD的能力，并提供了新的数据集支持。

Abstract: Few-Shot Industrial Anomaly Detection (FS-IAD) has important applications in
automating industrial quality inspection. Recently, some FS-IAD methods based
on Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have been proposed with some
achievements through prompt learning or fine-tuning. However, existing LVLMs
focus on general tasks but lack basic industrial knowledge and reasoning
capabilities related to FS-IAD, making these methods far from specialized human
quality inspectors. To address these challenges, we propose a unified
framework, IADGPT, designed to perform FS-IAD in a human-like manner, while
also handling associated localization and reasoning tasks, even for diverse and
novel industrial products. To this end, we introduce a three-stage progressive
training strategy inspired by humans. Specifically, the first two stages
gradually guide IADGPT in acquiring fundamental industrial knowledge and
discrepancy awareness. In the third stage, we design an in-context
learning-based training paradigm, enabling IADGPT to leverage a few-shot image
as the exemplars for improved generalization to novel products. In addition, we
design a strategy that enables IADGPT to output image-level and pixel-level
anomaly scores using the logits output and the attention map, respectively, in
conjunction with the language output to accomplish anomaly reasoning. To
support our training, we present a new dataset comprising 100K images across
400 diverse industrial product categories with extensive attribute-level
textual annotations. Experiments indicate IADGPT achieves considerable
performance gains in anomaly detection and demonstrates competitiveness in
anomaly localization and reasoning. We will release our dataset in
camera-ready.

*Sehajdeep SIngh,A V Subramanyam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种轻量级视图转换框架TUNet，利用预训练扩散模型的高保真生成能力，通过融合策略解决模糊重建问题，实现了从单张输入图像合成新视图的高效方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法需要微调大型扩散模型或从头训练，成本高且重建效果模糊，泛化能力差。因此，探索一种轻量级框架，直接利用预训练扩散模型的高保真能力，同时解决模糊重建问题。

Method: 使用DDIM反演潜在空间，通过相机姿态条件转换U-Net（TUNet）预测目标视图的潜在表示，并提出融合策略利用DDIM反演中的噪声相关性，保留纹理细节。

Result: 在MVImgNet上的实验表明，该方法优于现有方法，实现了高质量的新视图合成。

Conclusion: 提出的轻量级框架TUNet结合融合策略，有效利用预训练扩散模型，解决了单图像新视图合成的模糊和泛化问题。

Abstract: Synthesizing novel views from a single input image is a challenging task. It
requires extrapolating the 3D structure of a scene while inferring details in
occluded regions, and maintaining geometric consistency across viewpoints. Many
existing methods must fine-tune large diffusion backbones using multiple views
or train a diffusion model from scratch, which is extremely expensive.
Additionally, they suffer from blurry reconstruction and poor generalization.
This gap presents the opportunity to explore an explicit lightweight view
translation framework that can directly utilize the high-fidelity generative
capabilities of a pretrained diffusion model while reconstructing a scene from
a novel view. Given the DDIM-inverted latent of a single input image, we employ
a camera pose-conditioned translation U-Net, TUNet, to predict the inverted
latent corresponding to the desired target view. However, the image sampled
using the predicted latent may result in a blurry reconstruction. To this end,
we propose a novel fusion strategy that exploits the inherent noise correlation
structure observed in DDIM inversion. The proposed fusion strategy helps
preserve the texture and fine-grained details. To synthesize the novel view, we
use the fused latent as the initial condition for DDIM sampling, leveraging the
generative prior of the pretrained diffusion model. Extensive experiments on
MVImgNet demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods.

### [74] [Beyond conventional vision: RGB-event fusion for robust object detection in dynamic traffic scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10704)
*Zhanwen Liu,Yujing Sun,Yang Wang,Nan Yang,Shengbo Eben Li,Xiangmo Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合事件相机和RGB相机的方法（MCFNet），通过动态范围信息提升复杂交通环境下的目标检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RGB相机在复杂交通环境（如夜间驾驶、隧道）中动态范围有限，导致全局对比度降低和高频细节丢失，影响目标检测。

Method: 提出MCFNet，包括事件校正模块（ECM）、事件动态上采样模块（EDUM）和跨模态融合模块（CMM），实现时空对齐和自适应特征融合。

Result: 在DSEC-Det和PKU-DAVIS-SOD数据集上，MCFNet显著优于现有方法，尤其在DSEC-Det上mAP50提升7.4%，mAP提升1.7%。

Conclusion: MCFNet通过融合事件相机和RGB相机信息，有效提升了复杂光照和快速运动场景下的目标检测性能。

Abstract: The dynamic range limitation of conventional RGB cameras reduces global
contrast and causes loss of high-frequency details such as textures and edges
in complex traffic environments (e.g., nighttime driving, tunnels), hindering
discriminative feature extraction and degrading frame-based object detection.
To address this, we integrate a bio-inspired event camera with an RGB camera to
provide high dynamic range information and propose a motion cue fusion network
(MCFNet), which achieves optimal spatiotemporal alignment and adaptive
cross-modal feature fusion under challenging lighting. Specifically, an event
correction module (ECM) temporally aligns asynchronous event streams with image
frames via optical-flow-based warping, jointly optimized with the detection
network to learn task-aware event representations. The event dynamic upsampling
module (EDUM) enhances spatial resolution of event frames to match image
structures, ensuring precise spatiotemporal alignment. The cross-modal mamba
fusion module (CMM) uses adaptive feature fusion with a novel interlaced
scanning mechanism, effectively integrating complementary information for
robust detection. Experiments conducted on the DSEC-Det and PKU-DAVIS-SOD
datasets demonstrate that MCFNet significantly outperforms existing methods in
various poor lighting and fast moving traffic scenarios. Notably, on the
DSEC-Det dataset, MCFNet achieves a remarkable improvement, surpassing the best
existing methods by 7.4% in mAP50 and 1.7% in mAP metrics, respectively. The
code is available at https://github.com/Charm11492/MCFNet.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为CountCluster的方法，通过优化对象交叉注意力图以匹配输入对象数量，显著提升了生成图像中对象数量的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的扩散模型在生成图像时难以准确反映输入提示中的对象数量，且现有方法依赖外部工具或训练，效果有限。

Method: CountCluster方法在推理时根据注意力分数将对象交叉注意力图分为k个簇，定义理想分布并优化潜在变量以对齐目标分布。

Result: 方法在对象数量准确性上平均提升了18.5%，并在多种提示下表现出优越的数量控制性能。

Conclusion: CountCluster无需外部工具或额外训练，有效解决了生成图像中对象数量不准确的问题。

Abstract: Diffusion-based text-to-image generation models have demonstrated strong
performance in terms of image quality and diversity. However, they still
struggle to generate images that accurately reflect the number of objects
specified in the input prompt. Several approaches have been proposed that rely
on either external counting modules for iterative refinement or quantity
representations derived from learned tokens or latent features. However, they
still have limitations in accurately reflecting the specified number of objects
and overlook an important structural characteristic--The number of object
instances in the generated image is largely determined in the early timesteps
of the denoising process. To correctly reflect the object quantity for image
generation, the highly activated regions in the object cross-attention map at
the early timesteps should match the input object quantity, while each region
should be clearly separated. To address this issue, we propose
\textit{CountCluster}, a method that guides the object cross-attention map to
be clustered according to the specified object count in the input, without
relying on any external tools or additional training. The proposed method
partitions the object cross-attention map into $k$ clusters at inference time
based on attention scores, defines an ideal distribution in which each cluster
is spatially well-separated, and optimizes the latent to align with this target
distribution. Our method achieves an average improvement of 18.5\%p in object
count accuracy compared to existing methods, and demonstrates superior quantity
control performance across a variety of prompts. Code will be released at:

TL;DR: SegDAC是一种基于分割的视觉强化学习方法，通过结合SAM和YOLO-World实现对象中心分解和语义标注，显著提升了视觉泛化能力和样本效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉强化学习需要从高维输入和噪声奖励中同时学习感知和动作，现有大模型在RL中的整合效果不明确，因此提出SegDAC。

Method: SegDAC利用SAM进行对象中心分解，YOLO-World通过文本提示语义标注，采用新型Transformer架构动态处理分段，并通过在线RL学习关注重点。

Result: 在Maniskill3基准测试中，SegDAC在视觉泛化能力上表现优异，最难任务性能翻倍，样本效率优于或匹配现有方法。

Conclusion: SegDAC通过对象中心分割和语义标注，显著提升了视觉强化学习的泛化能力和效率。

Abstract: Visual reinforcement learning (RL) is challenging due to the need to learn
both perception and actions from high-dimensional inputs and noisy rewards.
Although large perception models exist, integrating them effectively into RL
for visual generalization and improved sample efficiency remains unclear. We
propose SegDAC, a Segmentation-Driven Actor-Critic method. SegDAC uses Segment
Anything (SAM) for object-centric decomposition and YOLO-World to ground
segments semantically via text prompts. It includes a novel transformer-based
architecture that supports a dynamic number of segments at each time step and
effectively learns which segments to focus on using online RL, without using
human labels. By evaluating SegDAC over a challenging visual generalization
benchmark using Maniskill3, which covers diverse manipulation tasks under
strong visual perturbations, we demonstrate that SegDAC achieves significantly
better visual generalization, doubling prior performance on the hardest setting
and matching or surpassing prior methods in sample efficiency across all
evaluated tasks.

Result: 验证了模型在FPGA上部署的可行性，并展示了在船只与风力机分类任务中的有效性。

Conclusion: 神经网络方法为SAR数据的实时处理和分类提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data enables large-scale surveillance of
maritime vessels. However, near-real-time monitoring is currently constrained
by the need to downlink all raw data, perform image focusing, and subsequently
analyze it on the ground. On-board processing to generate higher-level products
could reduce the data volume that needs to be downlinked, alleviating bandwidth
constraints and minimizing latency. However, traditional image focusing and
processing algorithms face challenges due to the satellite's limited memory,
processing power, and computational resources. This work proposes and evaluates
neural networks designed for real-time inference on unfocused SAR data acquired
in Stripmap and Interferometric Wide (IW) modes captured with Sentinel-1. Our
results demonstrate the feasibility of using one of our models for on-board
processing and deployment on an FPGA. Additionally, by investigating a binary
classification task between ships and windmills, we demonstrate that target
classification is possible.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的跨视角定位框架，通过改进图像匹配和定位方法，显著提高了精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在GNSS受限环境中，现有方法无法建立严格的跨视角对应关系，导致定位结果粗糙或几何不一致。

Method: 引入表面模型进行精确的BEV投影，以及SimRefiner模块通过局部-全局残差校正优化相似矩阵。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提高了定位精度和图像匹配质量。

Conclusion: 提出的框架为极端视角差异下的跨视角定位设定了新的基准。

Abstract: Cross-view localization aims to estimate the 3 degrees of freedom pose of a
ground-view image by registering it to aerial or satellite imagery. It is
essential in GNSS-denied environments such as urban canyons and disaster zones.
Existing methods either regress poses directly or align features in a shared
bird's-eye view (BEV) space, both built upon accurate spatial correspondences
between perspectives. However, these methods fail to establish strict
cross-view correspondences, yielding only coarse or geometrically inconsistent
matches. Consequently, fine-grained image matching between ground and aerial
views remains an unsolved problem, which in turn constrains the
interpretability of localization results. In this paper, we revisit cross-view
localization from the perspective of cross-view image matching and propose a
novel framework that improves both matching and localization. Specifically, we
introduce a Surface Model to model visible regions for accurate BEV projection,
and a SimRefiner module to refine the similarity matrix through local-global
residual correction, eliminating the reliance on post-processing like RANSAC.
To further support research in this area, we introduce CVFM, the first
benchmark with 32,509 cross-view image pairs annotated with pixel-level
correspondences. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
substantially improves both localization accuracy and image matching quality,
setting new baselines under extreme viewpoint disparity.

Motivation: 现有的自回归图像生成系统仅利用代码本的索引值，忽略了其中丰富的令牌相似性信息。k-means聚类在代码本特征空间中表现不佳，存在令牌空间差异和质心距离不准确的问题。

Method: 提出DCPE方法，采用基于实例的距离替代质心距离，并通过凝聚合并技术解决令牌空间差异问题。

Result: 实验表明，DCPE能无缝集成现有系统，加速自回归模型训练42%，并提升FID和IS性能。

Conclusion: DCPE是一种即插即用的方法，能有效挖掘和利用代码本中的先验信息，提升图像生成系统的性能。

Abstract: Advanced discrete token-based autoregressive image generation systems first
tokenize images into sequences of token indices with a codebook, and then model
these sequences in an autoregressive paradigm. While autoregressive generative
models are trained only on index values, the prior encoded in the codebook,
which contains rich token similarity information, is not exploited. Recent
studies have attempted to incorporate this prior by performing naive k-means
clustering on the tokens, helping to facilitate the training of generative
models with a reduced codebook. However, we reveal that k-means clustering
performs poorly in the codebook feature space due to inherent issues, including
token space disparity and centroid distance inaccuracy. In this work, we
propose the Discriminative Codebook Prior Extractor (DCPE) as an alternative to
k-means clustering for more effectively mining and utilizing the token
similarity information embedded in the codebook. DCPE replaces the commonly
used centroid-based distance, which is found to be unsuitable and inaccurate
for the token feature space, with a more reasonable instance-based distance.
Using an agglomerative merging technique, it further addresses the token space
disparity issue by avoiding splitting high-density regions and aggregating
low-density ones. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DCPE is plug-and-play
and integrates seamlessly with existing codebook prior-based paradigms. With
the discriminative prior extracted, DCPE accelerates the training of
autoregressive models by 42% on LlamaGen-B and improves final FID and IS
performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有EgocentricQA研究局限于日常活动，而实际应用需应对视觉风格和语义内容差异显著的领域转移，因此需开发跨域评估基准。

Method: 提出EgoCross基准，覆盖手术、工业、极限运动和动物视角四个领域，包含约1,000个QA对和798个视频片段，支持OpenQA和CloseQA格式。

Result: 实验表明，现有MLLMs在非日常生活领域泛化能力不足。初步探索了微调和强化学习等改进方法。

Conclusion: EgoCross为推进领域自适应、鲁棒的自我中心视频理解奠定了基础，数据和代码已开源。

Abstract: Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have
significantly pushed the frontier of egocentric video question answering
(EgocentricQA). However, existing benchmarks and studies are mainly limited to
common daily activities such as cooking and cleaning. In contrast, real-world
deployment inevitably encounters domain shifts, where target domains differ
substantially in both visual style and semantic content. To bridge this gap, we
introduce \textbf{EgoCross}, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the
cross-domain generalization of MLLMs in EgocentricQA. EgoCross covers four
diverse and challenging domains, including surgery, industry, extreme sports,
and animal perspective, representing realistic and high-impact application
scenarios. It comprises approximately 1,000 QA pairs across 798 video clips,
spanning four key QA tasks: prediction, recognition, localization, and
counting. Each QA pair provides both OpenQA and CloseQA formats to support
fine-grained evaluation. Extensive experiments show that most existing MLLMs,
whether general-purpose or egocentric-specialized, struggle to generalize to
domains beyond daily life, highlighting the limitations of current models.
Furthermore, we conduct several pilot studies, \eg, fine-tuning and
reinforcement learning, to explore potential improvements. We hope EgoCross and
our accompanying analysis will serve as a foundation for advancing
domain-adaptive, robust egocentric video understanding. Data and codes will be

Abstract: Human perceptual systems excel at inducing and recognizing objects across
both known and novel categories, a capability far beyond current machine
learning frameworks. While generalized category discovery (GCD) aims to bridge
this gap, existing methods predominantly focus on optimizing objective
functions. We present an orthogonal solution, inspired by the human cognitive
process for novel object understanding: decomposing objects into visual
primitives and establishing cross-knowledge comparisons. We propose ConGCD,
which establishes primitive-oriented representations through high-level
semantic reconstruction, binding intra-class shared attributes via
deconstruction. Mirroring human preference diversity in visual processing,
where distinct individuals leverage dominant or contextual cues, we implement
dominant and contextual consensus units to capture class-discriminative
patterns and inherent distributional invariants, respectively. A consensus
scheduler dynamically optimizes activation pathways, with final predictions
emerging through multiplex consensus integration. Extensive evaluations across
coarse- and fine-grained benchmarks demonstrate ConGCD's effectiveness as a
consensus-aware paradigm. Code is available at github.com/lytang63/ConGCD.

Abstract: This paper presents a summary of the 2025 Sclera Segmentation Benchmarking
Competition (SSBC), which focused on the development of privacy-preserving
sclera-segmentation models trained using synthetically generated ocular images.
The goal of the competition was to evaluate how well models trained on
synthetic data perform in comparison to those trained on real-world datasets.
The competition featured two tracks: $(i)$ one relying solely on synthetic data
for model development, and $(ii)$ one combining/mixing synthetic with (a
limited amount of) real-world data. A total of nine research groups submitted
diverse segmentation models, employing a variety of architectural designs,
including transformer-based solutions, lightweight models, and segmentation
networks guided by generative frameworks. Experiments were conducted across
three evaluation datasets containing both synthetic and real-world images,
collected under diverse conditions. Results show that models trained entirely
on synthetic data can achieve competitive performance, particularly when
dedicated training strategies are employed, as evidenced by the top performing
models that achieved $F_1$ scores of over $0.8$ in the synthetic data track.
Moreover, performance gains in the mixed track were often driven more by
methodological choices rather than by the inclusion of real data, highlighting
the promise of synthetic data for privacy-aware biometric development. The code

Abstract: Symmetry is a fundamental concept that has been extensively studied, yet
detecting it in complex scenes remains a significant challenge in computer
vision. Recent heatmap-based approaches can localize potential regions of
symmetry axes but often lack precision in identifying individual axes. In this
work, we propose a novel framework for axis-level detection of the two most
common symmetry types-reflection and rotation-by representing them as explicit
geometric primitives, i.e. lines and points. Our method employs a dual-branch
architecture that is equivariant to the dihedral group, with each branch
specialized to exploit the structure of dihedral group-equivariant features for
its respective symmetry type. For reflection symmetry, we introduce
orientational anchors, aligned with group components, to enable
orientation-specific detection, and a reflectional matching that measures
similarity between patterns and their mirrored counterparts across candidate
axes. For rotational symmetry, we propose a rotational matching that compares
patterns at fixed angular intervals to identify rotational centers. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance,
outperforming existing approaches.

generation, but their slow iterative denoising process and prohibitive
quadratic attention costs for long sequences create significant inference
bottlenecks. While both step distillation and sparse attention mechanisms have
shown promise as independent acceleration strategies, effectively combining
these approaches presents critical challenges -- training-free integration
yields suboptimal results, while separately training sparse attention after
step distillation requires prohibitively expensive high-quality video data. To
overcome these limitations, we propose BLADE, an innovative data-free joint
training framework that introduces: (1) an Adaptive Block-Sparse Attention
(ASA) mechanism for dynamically generating content-aware sparsity masks to
focus computation on salient spatiotemporal features, and (2) a sparsity-aware
step distillation paradigm built upon Trajectory Distribution Matching (TDM)
that directly incorporates sparsity into the distillation process rather than
treating it as a separate compression step, with fast convergence. We validate
BLADE on text-to-video models like CogVideoX-5B and Wan2.1-1.3B. Our framework
demonstrates remarkable efficiency gains across different scales. On
Wan2.1-1.3B, BLADE achieves a 14.10x end-to-end inference acceleration over a
50-step baseline. Moreover, on models such as CogVideoX-5B with short video
sequence lengths, our framework delivers a robust 8.89x speedup. Crucially, the
acceleration is accompanied by a consistent quality improvement. On the
VBench-2.0 benchmark, BLADE boosts the score of CogVideoX-5B to 0.569 (from
0.534) and Wan2.1-1.3B to 0.570 (from 0.563), results that are further
corroborated by superior ratings in human evaluations. Our code and model
weights are publicly available at: http://ziplab.co/BLADE-Homepage/.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度伪造检测方法在未知伪造技术上表现不佳，亟需提升泛化能力以应对快速迭代的伪造技术。

Method: 采用FGL策略动态调整学习过程，设计DPNet网络捕捉伪造痕迹的差异和关系，结合频率流和空间特征。

Result: 实验表明该方法在不同场景下泛化能力强，能有效处理未知伪造挑战。

Conclusion: FGL和DPNet为深度伪造检测提供了鲁棒支持，代码已开源。

Abstract: The emergence of deepfake technology has introduced a range of societal
problems, garnering considerable attention. Current deepfake detection methods
perform well on specific datasets, but exhibit poor performance when applied to
datasets with unknown forgery techniques. Moreover, as the gap between emerging
and traditional forgery techniques continues to widen, cross-domain detection
methods that rely on common forgery traces are becoming increasingly
ineffective. This situation highlights the urgency of developing deepfake
detection technology with strong generalization to cope with fast iterative
forgery techniques. To address these challenges, we propose a Forgery Guided
Learning (FGL) strategy designed to enable detection networks to continuously
adapt to unknown forgery techniques. Specifically, the FGL strategy captures
the differential information between known and unknown forgery techniques,
allowing the model to dynamically adjust its learning process in real time. To
further improve the ability to perceive forgery traces, we design a Dual
Perception Network (DPNet) that captures both differences and relationships
among forgery traces. In the frequency stream, the network dynamically
perceives and extracts discriminative features across various forgery
techniques, establishing essential detection cues. These features are then
integrated with spatial features and projected into the embedding space. In
addition, graph convolution is employed to perceive relationships across the
entire feature space, facilitating a more comprehensive understanding of
forgery trace correlations. Extensive experiments show that our approach
generalizes well across different scenarios and effectively handles unknown
forgery challenges, providing robust support for deepfake detection. Our code
is available on https://github.com/vpsg-research/FGL.

TL;DR: DARC是一种新型的模型驱动群体配准框架，用于高效构建医学图像图谱，支持多种图像相似性度量，并解决了GPU内存问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据驱动方法依赖大数据集且泛化性差，而模型驱动方法虽数据高效但面临可扩展性和优化挑战。DARC旨在提供一种灵活、通用的解决方案。

Method: DARC采用坐标下降策略和中心性激活函数，支持任意数量的3D图像，生成无偏且保形的图谱。

Result: DARC在一次性分割和形状合成应用中表现优异，超越现有少样本方法。

Conclusion: DARC为图谱构建及应用提供了高效、通用的框架。

Abstract: Atlas construction is fundamental to medical image analysis, offering a
standardized spatial reference for tasks such as population-level anatomical
modeling. While data-driven registration methods have recently shown promise in
pairwise settings, their reliance on large training datasets, limited
generalizability, and lack of true inference phases in groupwise contexts
hinder their practical use. In contrast, model-driven methods offer
training-free, theoretically grounded, and data-efficient alternatives, though
they often face scalability and optimization challenges when applied to large
3D datasets. In this work, we introduce DARC (Diffeomorphic Atlas Registration
via Coordinate descent), a novel model-driven groupwise registration framework
for atlas construction. DARC supports a broad range of image dissimilarity
metrics and efficiently handles arbitrary numbers of 3D images without
incurring GPU memory issues. Through a coordinate descent strategy and a
centrality-enforcing activation function, DARC produces unbiased, diffeomorphic
atlases with high anatomical fidelity. Beyond atlas construction, we
demonstrate two key applications: (1) One-shot segmentation, where labels
annotated only on the atlas are propagated to subjects via inverse
deformations, outperforming state-of-the-art few-shot methods; and (2) shape
synthesis, where new anatomical variants are generated by warping the atlas
mesh using synthesized diffeomorphic deformation fields. Overall, DARC offers a
flexible, generalizable, and resource-efficient framework for atlas
construction and applications.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 空间物理推理是理解真实物理世界的基础能力，但当前视觉语言模型在此任务上的表现尚未充分探索。

Method: 采用监督微调结合规则强化学习的方法改进Qwen2.5-VL-7B模型。

Result: 改进后的模型在空间物理推理任务上表现显著提升，超越了主流专有模型，但泛化能力有限。

Conclusion: 尽管模型性能有所提升，但在新物理场景下的泛化能力仍需进一步研究，凸显了空间物理推理领域的新方法需求。

Abstract: Spatio-physical reasoning, a foundation capability for understanding the real
physics world, is a critical step towards building robust world models. While
recent vision language models (VLMs) have shown remarkable progress in
specialized domains like multimodal mathematics and pure spatial understanding,
their capability for spatio-physical reasoning remains largely unexplored. This
paper provides a comprehensive diagnostic analysis of mainstream VLMs,
revealing that current models perform inadequately on this crucial task.
Further detailed analysis shows that this underperformance is largely
attributable to biases caused by human-like prior and a lack of deep reasoning.
To address these challenges, we apply supervised fine-tuning followed by
rule-based reinforcement learning to Qwen2.5-VL-7B, resulting in significant
improvements in spatio-physical reasoning capabilities and surpassing leading
proprietary models. Nevertheless, despite this success, the model's
generalization to new physics scenarios remains limited -- underscoring the
pressing need for new approaches in spatio-physical reasoning.

Motivation: AI生成内容的快速发展带来了高度逼真的合成视频，对社会信任和数字完整性构成威胁，现有检测基准在真实感、规模和复杂性上不足。

Method: AEGIS包含10,000多个精心筛选的真实和合成视频，涵盖多种先进生成模型，并提供多模态注释。

Result: 实验表明，现有视觉语言模型在AEGIS最具挑战性的子集上检测能力有限，凸显了数据集的独特复杂性。

Conclusion: AEGIS为开发更鲁棒、可靠的视频真实性检测方法提供了关键基准，推动了该领域的研究。

Abstract: Recent advances in AI-generated content have fueled the rise of highly
realistic synthetic videos, posing severe risks to societal trust and digital
integrity. Existing benchmarks for video authenticity detection typically
suffer from limited realism, insufficient scale, and inadequate complexity,
failing to effectively evaluate modern vision-language models against
sophisticated forgeries. To address this critical gap, we introduce AEGIS, a
novel large-scale benchmark explicitly targeting the detection of
hyper-realistic and semantically nuanced AI-generated videos. AEGIS comprises
over 10,000 rigorously curated real and synthetic videos generated by diverse,
state-of-the-art generative models, including Stable Video Diffusion,
CogVideoX-5B, KLing, and Sora, encompassing open-source and proprietary
architectures. In particular, AEGIS features specially constructed challenging
subsets enhanced with robustness evaluation. Furthermore, we provide multimodal
annotations spanning Semantic-Authenticity Descriptions, Motion Features, and
Low-level Visual Features, facilitating authenticity detection and supporting
downstream tasks such as multimodal fusion and forgery localization. Extensive
experiments using advanced vision-language models demonstrate limited detection
capabilities on the most challenging subsets of AEGIS, highlighting the
dataset's unique complexity and realism beyond the current generalization
capabilities of existing models. In essence, AEGIS establishes an indispensable
evaluation benchmark, fundamentally advancing research toward developing
genuinely robust, reliable, broadly generalizable video authenticity detection
methodologies capable of addressing real-world forgery threats. Our dataset is

Motivation: 现有基于ControlNet的RefSR方法在图像对齐上效果不佳，且数据集分辨率低、质量差，无法支持高质量恢复。

Method: 设计TriFlowSR框架，采用Reference Matching Strategy实现图像匹配，并构建Landmark-4K数据集。

Result: 实验表明，TriFlowSR能更有效地利用参考图像的语义和纹理信息，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TriFlowSR是首个针对超高清地标场景的基于扩散的RefSR方法，解决了真实世界退化问题。

Abstract: Reference-based Image Super-Resolution (RefSR) aims to restore a
low-resolution (LR) image by utilizing the semantic and texture information
from an additional reference high-resolution (reference HR) image. Existing
diffusion-based RefSR methods are typically built upon ControlNet, which
struggles to effectively align the information between the LR image and the
reference HR image. Moreover, current RefSR datasets suffer from limited
resolution and poor image quality, resulting in the reference images lacking
sufficient fine-grained details to support high-quality restoration. To
overcome the limitations above, we propose TriFlowSR, a novel framework that
explicitly achieves pattern matching between the LR image and the reference HR
image. Meanwhile, we introduce Landmark-4K, the first RefSR dataset for
Ultra-High-Definition (UHD) landmark scenarios. Considering the UHD scenarios
with real-world degradation, in TriFlowSR, we design a Reference Matching
Strategy to effectively match the LR image with the reference HR image.
Experimental results show that our approach can better utilize the semantic and
texture information of the reference HR image compared to previous methods. To
the best of our knowledge, we propose the first diffusion-based RefSR pipeline
for ultra-high definition landmark scenarios under real-world degradation. Our
code and model will be available at https://github.com/nkicsl/TriFlowSR.

Motivation: 现有被动活体检测方法在区分真实面部与多种攻击（如打印照片、屏幕显示、面具和视频重放）时效果有限，需要更主动的交互方式提升准确性。

Method: 设计了一种用户交互场景，要求参与者缓慢将面部靠近相机，结合光流分析和神经网络分类器处理RGB帧和光流数据。

Result: 该方法通过提取面部体积信息，显著提高了对真实面部和攻击的区分能力，优于被动方法。

Conclusion: 提出的交互式光流分析方法在活体检测中表现出更高的可靠性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: In this work, we proposed a novel cooperative video-based face liveness
detection method based on a new user interaction scenario where participants
are instructed to slowly move their frontal-oriented face closer to the camera.
This controlled approaching face protocol, combined with optical flow analysis,
represents the core innovation of our approach. By designing a system where
users follow this specific movement pattern, we enable robust extraction of
facial volume information through neural optical flow estimation, significantly
improving discrimination between genuine faces and various presentation attacks
(including printed photos, screen displays, masks, and video replays). Our
method processes both the predicted optical flows and RGB frames through a
neural classifier, effectively leveraging spatial-temporal features for more
reliable liveness detection compared to passive methods.

TL;DR: VasoMIM是一种针对X射线血管造影的自监督学习框架，通过结合血管解剖知识改进传统MIM，显著提升了血管分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: X射线血管造影中血管分割的准确性对临床至关重要，但标注数据稀缺，且传统MIM方法因类别不平衡难以捕捉血管解剖结构。

Method: 提出VasoMIM框架，包含解剖引导的掩蔽策略和解剖一致性损失，专注于血管区域的重建和语义一致性。

Result: 在三个数据集上达到最先进性能，验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: VasoMIM为X射线血管造影分析提供了潜力巨大的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate vessel segmentation in X-ray angiograms is crucial for numerous
clinical applications. However, the scarcity of annotated data presents a
significant challenge, which has driven the adoption of self-supervised
learning (SSL) methods such as masked image modeling (MIM) to leverage
large-scale unlabeled data for learning transferable representations.
Unfortunately, conventional MIM often fails to capture vascular anatomy because
of the severe class imbalance between vessel and background pixels, leading to
weak vascular representations. To address this, we introduce Vascular
anatomy-aware Masked Image Modeling (VasoMIM), a novel MIM framework tailored
for X-ray angiograms that explicitly integrates anatomical knowledge into the
pre-training process. Specifically, it comprises two complementary components:
anatomy-guided masking strategy and anatomical consistency loss. The former
preferentially masks vessel-containing patches to focus the model on
reconstructing vessel-relevant regions. The latter enforces consistency in
vascular semantics between the original and reconstructed images, thereby
improving the discriminability of vascular representations. Empirically,
VasoMIM achieves state-of-the-art performance across three datasets. These
findings highlight its potential to facilitate X-ray angiogram analysis.

Method: 提出OF-Diff方法，首次基于布局提取对象先验形状，引入双分支扩散模型和扩散一致性损失，无需真实图像即可生成高保真图像，并通过DDPO优化扩散过程。

Result: 实验表明，OF-Diff在关键质量指标上优于现有方法，多态和小目标类别的性能显著提升，如飞机、船舶和车辆的mAP分别提高了8.3%、7.7%和4.0%。

Conclusion: OF-Diff通过改进对象保真度和多样性，为高精度遥感图像生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: High-precision controllable remote sensing image generation is both
meaningful and challenging. Existing diffusion models often produce
low-fidelity images due to their inability to adequately capture morphological
details, which may affect the robustness and reliability of object detection
models. To enhance the accuracy and fidelity of generated objects in remote
sensing, this paper proposes Object Fidelity Diffusion (OF-Diff), which
effectively improves the fidelity of generated objects. Specifically, we are
the first to extract the prior shapes of objects based on the layout for
diffusion models in remote sensing. Then, we introduce a dual-branch diffusion
model with diffusion consistency loss, which can generate high-fidelity remote
sensing images without providing real images during the sampling phase.
Furthermore, we introduce DDPO to fine-tune the diffusion process, making the
generated remote sensing images more diverse and semantically consistent.
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that OF-Diff outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in the remote sensing across key quality metrics. Notably, the
performance of several polymorphic and small object classes shows significant
improvement. For instance, the mAP increases by 8.3%, 7.7%, and 4.0% for
airplanes, ships, and vehicles, respectively.

planing ability, we also evaluate it on the AndroidWorld, an online UI
navigation arena, on which our 7B and 72B variants achieve 49.1% and 65.9%
success rate, also beating existing models.To achieve this, we introduce
carefully designed reward functions for both UI grounding and navigation tasks
and corresponding efficient data cleaning strategies.To further boost
navigation performance, we propose Self-Evolving Trajectory History Alignment
\& Sparse Action Enhancement that refine historical reasoning traces and
balances the distribution of sparse but critical actions, leading to more

Conclusion: BaCon-Stereo在遮挡和非遮挡区域均提升了预测性能，具有强泛化性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Current self-supervised stereo matching relies on the photometric consistency
assumption, which breaks down in occluded regions due to ill-posed
correspondences. To address this issue, we propose BaCon-Stereo, a simple yet
effective contrastive learning framework for self-supervised stereo network
training in both non-occluded and occluded regions. We adopt a teacher-student
paradigm with multi-baseline inputs, in which the stereo pairs fed into the
teacher and student share the same reference view but differ in target views.
Geometrically, regions occluded in the student's target view are often visible
in the teacher's, making it easier for the teacher to predict in these regions.
The teacher's prediction is rescaled to match the student's baseline and then
used to supervise the student. We also introduce an occlusion-aware attention
map to better guide the student in learning occlusion completion. To support
training, we synthesize a multi-baseline dataset BaCon-20k. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that BaCon-Stereo improves prediction in both occluded
and non-occluded regions, achieves strong generalization and robustness, and
outperforms state-of-the-art self-supervised methods on both KITTI 2015 and
2012 benchmarks. Our code and dataset will be released upon paper acceptance.

Conclusion: AdaptFED不仅扩展了焦点调制在联邦学习中的应用，还为更自适应、可扩展的基于Transformer的联邦系统铺平了道路。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has proven essential for privacy-preserving,
collaborative training across distributed clients. Our prior work, TransFed,
introduced a robust transformer-based FL framework that leverages a
learn-to-adapt hypernetwork to generate personalized focal modulation layers
per client, outperforming traditional methods in non-IID and cross-domain
settings. In this extended version, we propose AdaptFED, where we deepen the
investigation of focal modulation in generalizable FL by incorporating: (1) a
refined adaptation strategy that integrates task-aware client embeddings to
personalize modulation dynamics further, (2) enhanced theoretical bounds on
adaptation performance, and (3) broader empirical validation across additional
modalities, including time-series and multilingual data. We also introduce an
efficient variant of TransFed that reduces server-client communication overhead
via low-rank hypernetwork conditioning, enabling scalable deployment in
resource-constrained environments. Extensive experiments on eight diverse
datasets reaffirm the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art
baselines, particularly in source-free and cross-task federated setups. Our
findings not only extend the capabilities of focal modulation in FL but also
pave the way for more adaptive, scalable, and generalizable transformer-based
federated systems. The code is available at

Result: 实验表明，PhysHPO显著提升了视频生成的物理合理性和整体质量。

Conclusion: PhysHPO为更真实和符合人类偏好的视频生成范式开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Recent advancements in video generation have enabled the creation of
high-quality, visually compelling videos. However, generating videos that
adhere to the laws of physics remains a critical challenge for applications
requiring realism and accuracy. In this work, we propose PhysHPO, a novel
framework for Hierarchical Cross-Modal Direct Preference Optimization, to
tackle this challenge by enabling fine-grained preference alignment for
physically plausible video generation. PhysHPO optimizes video alignment across
four hierarchical granularities: a) Instance Level, aligning the overall video
content with the input prompt; b) State Level, ensuring temporal consistency
using boundary frames as anchors; c) Motion Level, modeling motion trajectories
for realistic dynamics; and d) Semantic Level, maintaining logical consistency
between narrative and visuals. Recognizing that real-world videos are the best
reflections of physical phenomena, we further introduce an automated data
selection pipeline to efficiently identify and utilize "good data" from
existing large-scale text-video datasets, thereby eliminating the need for
costly and time-intensive dataset construction. Extensive experiments on both
physics-focused and general capability benchmarks demonstrate that PhysHPO
significantly improves physical plausibility and overall video generation
quality of advanced models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
work to explore fine-grained preference alignment and data selection for video
generation, paving the way for more realistic and human-preferred video
generation paradigms.

Conclusion: GPT-5系列模型在神经肿瘤VQA任务中表现中等，但尚不适用于临床。

Abstract: Accurate differentiation of brain tumor types on magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) is critical for guiding treatment planning in neuro-oncology. Recent
advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled visual question answering
(VQA) approaches that integrate image interpretation with natural language
reasoning. In this study, we evaluated GPT-4o, GPT-5-nano, GPT-5-mini, and
GPT-5 on a curated brain tumor VQA benchmark derived from 3 Brain Tumor
Segmentation (BraTS) datasets - glioblastoma (GLI), meningioma (MEN), and brain
metastases (MET). Each case included multi-sequence MRI triplanar mosaics and
structured clinical features transformed into standardized VQA items. Models
were assessed in a zero-shot chain-of-thought setting for accuracy on both
visual and reasoning tasks. Results showed that GPT-5-mini achieved the highest
macro-average accuracy (44.19%), followed by GPT-5 (43.71%), GPT-4o (41.49%),
and GPT-5-nano (35.85%). Performance varied by tumor subtype, with no single
model dominating across all cohorts. These findings suggest that GPT-5 family
models can achieve moderate accuracy in structured neuro-oncological VQA tasks,
but not at a level acceptable for clinical use.

TL;DR: ToonComposer是一个生成模型，将动画制作的中间帧生成和上色阶段统一为一个后关键帧阶段，减少人工工作量并提高灵活性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统动画制作需要大量人工操作，现有AI方法分阶段处理会导致错误累积和伪影。ToonComposer旨在解决这些问题。

Method: ToonComposer通过稀疏草图注入机制和卡通适配方法（空间低秩适配器）统一中间帧生成和上色，利用现代视频基础模型。

Result: ToonComposer在视觉质量、运动一致性和生产效率上优于现有方法，支持稀疏输入和多草图控制。

Conclusion: ToonComposer为AI辅助动画制作提供了更高效、灵活的解决方案，并通过PKBench验证其优越性。

Abstract: Traditional cartoon and anime production involves keyframing, inbetweening,
and colorization stages, which require intensive manual effort. Despite recent
advances in AI, existing methods often handle these stages separately, leading
to error accumulation and artifacts. For instance, inbetweening approaches
struggle with large motions, while colorization methods require dense per-frame
sketches. To address this, we introduce ToonComposer, a generative model that
unifies inbetweening and colorization into a single post-keyframing stage.
ToonComposer employs a sparse sketch injection mechanism to provide precise
control using keyframe sketches. Additionally, it uses a cartoon adaptation
method with the spatial low-rank adapter to tailor a modern video foundation
model to the cartoon domain while keeping its temporal prior intact. Requiring
as few as a single sketch and a colored reference frame, ToonComposer excels
with sparse inputs, while also supporting multiple sketches at any temporal
location for more precise motion control. This dual capability reduces manual
workload and improves flexibility, empowering artists in real-world scenarios.
To evaluate our model, we further created PKBench, a benchmark featuring
human-drawn sketches that simulate real-world use cases. Our evaluation
demonstrates that ToonComposer outperforms existing methods in visual quality,
motion consistency, and production efficiency, offering a superior and more
flexible solution for AI-assisted cartoon production.

TL;DR: STream3R是一种基于Transformer的3D重建方法，通过流式处理和因果注意力机制高效处理图像序列，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有多视角3D重建方法依赖全局优化或内存机制扩展性差的问题。

Method: 采用解码器-only Transformer，结合因果注意力和几何先验学习，适用于动态场景。

Result: 在静态和动态场景基准测试中表现优异，支持大规模预训练和微调。

Conclusion: 展示了因果Transformer模型在实时3D感知中的潜力。

Abstract: We present STream3R, a novel approach to 3D reconstruction that reformulates
pointmap prediction as a decoder-only Transformer problem. Existing
state-of-the-art methods for multi-view reconstruction either depend on
expensive global optimization or rely on simplistic memory mechanisms that
scale poorly with sequence length. In contrast, STream3R introduces an
streaming framework that processes image sequences efficiently using causal
attention, inspired by advances in modern language modeling. By learning
geometric priors from large-scale 3D datasets, STream3R generalizes well to
diverse and challenging scenarios, including dynamic scenes where traditional
methods often fail. Extensive experiments show that our method consistently
outperforms prior work across both static and dynamic scene benchmarks.
Moreover, STream3R is inherently compatible with LLM-style training
infrastructure, enabling efficient large-scale pretraining and fine-tuning for
various downstream 3D tasks. Our results underscore the potential of causal
Transformer models for online 3D perception, paving the way for real-time 3D
understanding in streaming environments. More details can be found in our

Motivation: 自监督学习在遥感领域潜力巨大，但现有方法需适应地球观测数据的独特特性。

Method: 通过综合评估融合策略和重建目标归一化方案，提出MAESTRO方法，结合优化的融合策略和光谱先验作为自监督信号。

Result: 在四个地球观测数据集上，MAESTRO在多时相动态任务中达到新SOTA，在单时相任务中表现也极具竞争力。

Conclusion: MAESTRO为遥感数据的自监督学习提供了有效解决方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning holds great promise for remote sensing, but standard
self-supervised methods must be adapted to the unique characteristics of Earth
observation data. We take a step in this direction by conducting a
comprehensive benchmark of fusion strategies and reconstruction target
normalization schemes for multimodal, multitemporal, and multispectral Earth
observation data. Based on our findings, we propose MAESTRO, a novel adaptation
of the Masked Autoencoder, featuring optimized fusion strategies and a tailored
target normalization scheme that introduces a spectral prior as a
self-supervisory signal. Evaluated on four Earth observation datasets, MAESTRO
sets a new state-of-the-art on tasks that strongly rely on multitemporal
dynamics, while remaining highly competitive on tasks dominated by a single
mono-temporal modality. Code to reproduce all our experiments is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ESSENTIAL提出了一种结合稀疏特征存储和语义提示的视频类增量学习方法，解决了内存效率与性能的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频类增量学习方法在内存效率和性能之间存在矛盾，稀疏存储牺牲了时间信息，而密集存储内存消耗大。

Method: ESSENTIAL结合稀疏特征的片段记忆和语义提示的语义记忆，通过交叉注意力模块检索密集特征。

Result: 在多个数据集上验证，ESSENTIAL显著减少内存消耗的同时保持了优越性能。

Conclusion: ESSENTIAL通过整合片段和语义记忆，有效平衡了内存效率和性能，为视频类增量学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: In this work, we tackle the problem of video classincremental learning
(VCIL). Many existing VCIL methods mitigate catastrophic forgetting by
rehearsal training with a few temporally dense samples stored in episodic
memory, which is memory-inefficient. Alternatively, some methods store
temporally sparse samples, sacrificing essential temporal information and
thereby resulting in inferior performance. To address this trade-off between
memory-efficiency and performance, we propose EpiSodic and SEmaNTIc memory
integrAtion for video class-incremental Learning (ESSENTIAL). ESSENTIAL
consists of episodic memory for storing temporally sparse features and semantic
memory for storing general knowledge represented by learnable prompts. We
introduce a novel memory retrieval (MR) module that integrates episodic memory
and semantic prompts through cross-attention, enabling the retrieval of
temporally dense features from temporally sparse features. We rigorously
validate ESSENTIAL on diverse datasets: UCF-101, HMDB51, and
Something-Something-V2 from the TCD benchmark and UCF-101, ActivityNet, and
Kinetics-400 from the vCLIMB benchmark. Remarkably, with significantly reduced
memory, ESSENTIAL achieves favorable performance on the benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有跨领域模型依赖领域特定组件和多阶段训练，限制了实用性和扩展性。

Method: 提出Pose-in-Context (PiC)和Human-in-Context (HiC)，后者结合姿态和网格表示，扩展任务覆盖范围，并引入最大-最小相似性提示采样策略和双分支上下文注入网络架构。

Result: HiC在泛化性、数据规模和性能上优于PiC，展示了统一跨领域模型的潜力。

Conclusion: HiC为构建灵活且可扩展的统一跨领域3D人体运动模型提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: This paper aims to model 3D human motion across domains, where a single model
is expected to handle multiple modalities, tasks, and datasets. Existing
cross-domain models often rely on domain-specific components and multi-stage
training, which limits their practicality and scalability. To overcome these
challenges, we propose a new setting to train a unified cross-domain model
through a single process, eliminating the need for domain-specific components
and multi-stage training. We first introduce Pose-in-Context (PiC), which
leverages in-context learning to create a pose-centric cross-domain model.
While PiC generalizes across multiple pose-based tasks and datasets, it
encounters difficulties with modality diversity, prompting strategy, and
contextual dependency handling. We thus propose Human-in-Context (HiC), an
extension of PiC that broadens generalization across modalities, tasks, and
datasets. HiC combines pose and mesh representations within a unified
framework, expands task coverage, and incorporates larger-scale datasets.
Additionally, HiC introduces a max-min similarity prompt sampling strategy to
enhance generalization across diverse domains and a network architecture with
dual-branch context injection for improved handling of contextual dependencies.
Extensive experimental results show that HiC performs better than PiC in terms
of generalization, data scale, and performance across a wide range of domains.
These results demonstrate the potential of HiC for building a unified
cross-domain 3D human motion model with improved flexibility and scalability.

TL;DR: Puppeteer是一个自动化绑定和动画框架，通过预测骨骼结构和推断皮肤权重，显著提升了3D内容生成的效率和质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代交互应用需要动态3D内容，但静态3D模型到动画资产的转换依赖专家干预，成为内容创建的瓶颈。

Method: 使用自回归变换器预测骨骼结构，结合基于注意力的架构推断皮肤权重，并通过可微分优化生成动画。

Result: 在多个基准测试中显著优于现有技术，骨骼预测准确性和皮肤权重质量均有提升。

Conclusion: Puppeteer能够高效处理多样3D内容，生成稳定的高质量动画，解决了现有方法的抖动问题。

Abstract: Modern interactive applications increasingly demand dynamic 3D content, yet
the transformation of static 3D models into animated assets constitutes a
significant bottleneck in content creation pipelines. While recent advances in
generative AI have revolutionized static 3D model creation, rigging and
animation continue to depend heavily on expert intervention. We present
Puppeteer, a comprehensive framework that addresses both automatic rigging and
animation for diverse 3D objects. Our system first predicts plausible skeletal
structures via an auto-regressive transformer that introduces a joint-based
tokenization strategy for compact representation and a hierarchical ordering
methodology with stochastic perturbation that enhances bidirectional learning
capabilities. It then infers skinning weights via an attention-based
architecture incorporating topology-aware joint attention that explicitly
encodes inter-joint relationships based on skeletal graph distances. Finally,
we complement these rigging advances with a differentiable optimization-based
animation pipeline that generates stable, high-fidelity animations while being
computationally more efficient than existing approaches. Extensive evaluations
across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in both skeletal prediction accuracy
and skinning quality. The system robustly processes diverse 3D content, ranging
from professionally designed game assets to AI-generated shapes, producing
temporally coherent animations that eliminate the jittering issues common in
existing methods.

Motivation: 量子隐式神经表示（QINRs）作为一种新兴范式，在架构设计、量子力学特性利用、训练效率等方面仍面临挑战。本文旨在解决这些问题，推动QINRs的发展。

Method: QVF采用基于可学习能量流形的神经振幅编码，将经典数据嵌入量子态向量，使用全纠缠的可学习参数化量子电路，并在实希尔伯特空间中执行量子操作，实现数值稳定的训练和快速收敛。

Result: 实验表明，QVF在视觉表示精度上优于现有量子方法和经典基线，尤其在捕获高频细节方面表现突出，并在2D和3D场补全及3D形状插值中展示了实际应用潜力。

Conclusion: QVF为量子隐式神经表示提供了一种高效且稳定的新方法，展示了其在视觉和几何学习中的实际应用价值。

Abstract: Quantum Implicit Neural Representations (QINRs) include components for
learning and execution on gate-based quantum computers. While QINRs recently
emerged as a promising new paradigm, many challenges concerning their
architecture and ansatz design, the utility of quantum-mechanical properties,
training efficiency and the interplay with classical modules remain. This paper
advances the field by introducing a new type of QINR for 2D image and 3D
geometric field learning, which we collectively refer to as Quantum Visual
Field (QVF). QVF encodes classical data into quantum statevectors using neural
amplitude encoding grounded in a learnable energy manifold, ensuring meaningful
Hilbert space embeddings. Our ansatz follows a fully entangled design of
learnable parametrised quantum circuits, with quantum (unitary) operations
performed in the real Hilbert space, resulting in numerically stable training
with fast convergence. QVF does not rely on classical post-processing -- in
contrast to the previous QINR learning approach -- and directly employs
projective measurement to extract learned signals encoded in the ansatz.
Experiments on a quantum hardware simulator demonstrate that QVF outperforms
the existing quantum approach and widely used classical foundational baselines
in terms of visual representation accuracy across various metrics and model
characteristics, such as learning of high-frequency details. We also show
applications of QVF in 2D and 3D field completion and 3D shape interpolation,
highlighting its practical potential.

Conclusion: 该框架在复杂多楼层环境中验证有效，解决了机器人绑架问题，提供了一种可扩展、低成本的室内定位方案。

Abstract: Global localization is essential for autonomous robotics, especially in
indoor environments where the GPS signal is denied. We propose a novel
WiFi-based localization framework that leverages ubiquitous wireless
infrastructure and the OpenStreetMap Area Graph (osmAG) for large-scale indoor
environments. Our approach integrates signal propagation modeling with osmAG's
geometric and topological priors. In the offline phase, an iterative
optimization algorithm localizes WiFi Access Points (APs) by modeling wall
attenuation, achieving a mean localization error of 3.79 m (35.3\% improvement
over trilateration). In the online phase, real-time robot localization uses the
augmented osmAG map, yielding a mean error of 3.12 m in fingerprinted areas
(8.77\% improvement over KNN fingerprinting) and 3.83 m in non-fingerprinted
areas (81.05\% improvement). Comparison with a fingerprint-based method shows
that our approach is much more space efficient and achieves superior
localization accuracy, especially for positions where no fingerprint data are
available. Validated across a complex 11,025 &m^2& multi-floor environment,
this framework offers a scalable, cost-effective solution for indoor robotic
localization, solving the kidnapped robot problem. The code and dataset are

Conclusion: ST-GCS是一种高效且无需初始猜测的动态环境轨迹规划方法。

Abstract: In this paper, we create optimal, collision-free, time-dependent trajectories
through cluttered dynamic environments. The many spatial and temporal
constraints make finding an initial guess for a numerical solver difficult.
Graphs of Convex Sets (GCS) and the recently developed Space-Time Graphs of
Convex Sets formulation (ST-GCS) enable us to generate optimal minimum distance
collision-free trajectories without providing an initial guess to the solver.
We also explore the derivation of general GCS-compatible constraints and
document an intuitive strategy for adapting general constraints to the
framework. We show that ST-GCS produces equivalent trajectories to the standard
GCS formulation when the environment is static. We then show ST-GCS operating
in dynamic environments to find minimum distance collision-free trajectories.

Abstract: Robust bipedal locomotion in exoskeletons requires the ability to dynamically

simultaneously planning foot contact schedules and continuous domain

Conclusion: ReconVLA通过隐式接地范式，显著提升了VLA模型的视觉注意力分配和任务执行能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have enabled robotic
agents to integrate multimodal understanding with action execution. However,
our empirical analysis reveals that current VLAs struggle to allocate visual
attention to target regions. Instead, visual attention is always dispersed. To
guide the visual attention grounding on the correct target, we propose
ReconVLA, a reconstructive VLA model with an implicit grounding paradigm.
Conditioned on the model's visual outputs, a diffusion transformer aims to
reconstruct the gaze region of the image, which corresponds to the target
manipulated objects. This process prompts the VLA model to learn fine-grained
representations and accurately allocate visual attention, thus effectively
leveraging task-specific visual information and conducting precise
manipulation. Moreover, we curate a large-scale pretraining dataset comprising
over 100k trajectories and 2 million data samples from open-source robotic
datasets, further boosting the model's generalization in visual reconstruction.
Extensive experiments in simulation and the real world demonstrate the
superiority of our implicit grounding method, showcasing its capabilities of
precise manipulation and generalization. Our project page is

Abstract: This paper presents BEASST (Behavioral Entropic Gradient-based Adaptive
Source Seeking for Mobile Robots), a novel framework for robotic source seeking
in complex, unknown environments. Our approach enables mobile robots to
efficiently balance exploration and exploitation by modeling normalized signal
strength as a surrogate probability of source location. Building on Behavioral
Entropy(BE) with Prelec's probability weighting function, we define an
objective function that adapts robot behavior from risk-averse to risk-seeking
based on signal reliability and mission urgency. The framework provides
theoretical convergence guarantees under unimodal signal assumptions and
practical stability under bounded disturbances. Experimental validation across
DARPA SubT and multi-room scenarios demonstrates that BEASST consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving 15% reduction in path length

Abstract: Reinforcement learning in large reasoning models enables learning from
feedback on their outputs, making it particularly valuable in scenarios where
fine-tuning data is limited. However, its application in multi-modal human
activity recognition (HAR) domains remains largely underexplored. Our work
extends reinforcement learning to the human activity recognition domain with
multimodal large language models. By incorporating visual reinforcement
learning in the training process, the model's generalization ability on
few-shot recognition can be greatly improved. Additionally, visual
reinforcement learning can enhance the model's reasoning ability and enable
explainable analysis in the inference stage. We name our few-shot human
activity recognition method with visual reinforcement learning FAVOR.
Specifically, our approach first utilizes a multimodal large language model
(MLLM) to generate multiple candidate responses for the human activity image,
each containing reasoning traces and final answers. These responses are then
evaluated using reward functions, and the MLLM model is subsequently optimized
using the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm. In this way, the
MLLM model can be adapted to human activity recognition with only a few
samples. Extensive experiments on four human activity recognition datasets and
five different settings demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method.

Abstract: Upper-limb exoskeletons are primarily designed to provide assistive support
by accurately interpreting and responding to human intentions. In home-care
scenarios, exoskeletons are expected to adapt their assistive configurations
based on the semantic information of the task, adjusting appropriately in
accordance with the nature of the object being manipulated. However, existing
solutions often lack the ability to understand task semantics or
collaboratively plan actions with the user, limiting their generalizability. To
address this challenge, this paper introduces a semantic-aware framework that
integrates large language models into the task planning framework, enabling the
delivery of safe and intent-integrative assistance. The proposed approach
begins with the exoskeleton operating in transparent mode to capture the
wearer's intent during object grasping. Once semantic information is extracted
from the task description, the system automatically configures appropriate
assistive parameters. In addition, a diffusion-based anomaly detector is used
to continuously monitor the state of human-robot interaction and trigger
real-time replanning in response to detected anomalies. During task execution,
online trajectory refinement and impedance control are used to ensure safety
and regulate human-robot interaction. Experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed method effectively aligns with the wearer's cognition, adapts to
semantically varying tasks, and responds reliably to anomalies.

Abstract: Conventionally, human intuition often defines vision as a modality of passive
optical sensing, while active optical sensing is typically regarded as
measuring rather than the default modality of vision. However, the situation
now changes: sensor technologies and data-driven paradigms empower active
optical sensing to redefine the boundaries of vision, ushering in a new era of
active vision. Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensors capture reflectance
from object surfaces, which remains invariant under varying illumination
conditions, showcasing significant potential in robotic perception tasks such
as detection, recognition, segmentation, and Simultaneous Localization and
Mapping (SLAM). These applications often rely on dense sensing capabilities,
typically achieved by high-resolution, expensive LiDAR sensors. A key challenge
with low-cost LiDARs lies in the sparsity of scan data, which limits their
broader application. To address this limitation, this work introduces an
innovative framework for generating dense LiDAR reflectance images from sparse
data, leveraging the unique attributes of non-repeating scanning LiDAR
(NRS-LiDAR). We tackle critical challenges, including reflectance calibration
and the transition from static to dynamic scene domains, facilitating the
reconstruction of dense reflectance images in real-world settings. The key
contributions of this work include a comprehensive dataset for LiDAR
reflectance image densification, a densification network tailored for
NRS-LiDAR, and diverse applications such as loop closure and traffic lane
detection using the generated dense reflectance images.

Abstract: Embodied AI aims to develop intelligent systems with physical forms capable
of perceiving, decision-making, acting, and learning in real-world
environments, providing a promising way to Artificial General Intelligence
(AGI). Despite decades of explorations, it remains challenging for embodied
agents to achieve human-level intelligence for general-purpose tasks in open
dynamic environments. Recent breakthroughs in large models have revolutionized
embodied AI by enhancing perception, interaction, planning and learning. In
this article, we provide a comprehensive survey on large model empowered
embodied AI, focusing on autonomous decision-making and embodied learning. We
investigate both hierarchical and end-to-end decision-making paradigms,
detailing how large models enhance high-level planning, low-level execution,
and feedback for hierarchical decision-making, and how large models enhance
Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models for end-to-end decision making. For
embodied learning, we introduce mainstream learning methodologies, elaborating
on how large models enhance imitation learning and reinforcement learning
in-depth. For the first time, we integrate world models into the survey of
embodied AI, presenting their design methods and critical roles in enhancing
decision-making and learning. Though solid advances have been achieved,
challenges still exist, which are discussed at the end of this survey,
potentially as the further research directions.

Conclusion: Self-correction Flywheel范式显著提升了模型的错误校正能力和性能，适用于动态避障和长指令跟随。

Abstract: Existing vision-and-language navigation models often deviate from the correct
trajectory when executing instructions. However, these models lack effective
error correction capability, hindering their recovery from errors. To address
this challenge, we propose Self-correction Flywheel, a novel post-training
paradigm. Instead of considering the model's error trajectories on the training
set as a drawback, our paradigm emphasizes their significance as a valuable
data source. We have developed a method to identify deviations in these error
trajectories and devised innovative techniques to automatically generate
self-correction data for perception and action. These self-correction data
serve as fuel to power the model's continued training. The brilliance of our
paradigm is revealed when we re-evaluate the model on the training set,
uncovering new error trajectories. At this time, the self-correction flywheel
begins to spin. Through multiple flywheel iterations, we progressively enhance
our monocular RGB-based VLA navigation model CorrectNav. Experiments on R2R-CE
and RxR-CE benchmarks show CorrectNav achieves new state-of-the-art success
rates of 65.1% and 69.3%, surpassing prior best VLA navigation models by 8.2%
and 16.4%. Real robot tests in various indoor and outdoor environments
demonstrate \method's superior capability of error correction, dynamic obstacle
avoidance, and long instruction following.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel method to enhance locomotion for a single
humanoid robot through cooperative-heterogeneous multi-agent deep reinforcement
learning (MARL). While most existing methods typically employ single-agent
reinforcement learning algorithms for a single humanoid robot or MARL
algorithms for multi-robot system tasks, we propose a distinct paradigm:
applying cooperative-heterogeneous MARL to optimize locomotion for a single
humanoid robot. The proposed method, multi-agent reinforcement learning for
single humanoid locomotion (MASH), treats each limb (legs and arms) as an
independent agent that explores the robot's action space while sharing a global
critic for cooperative learning. Experiments demonstrate that MASH accelerates
training convergence and improves whole-body cooperation ability, outperforming
conventional single-agent reinforcement learning methods. This work advances
the integration of MARL into single-humanoid-robot control, offering new
insights into efficient locomotion strategies.

Abstract: Developing robotic algorithms and integrating a robotic subsystem into a
larger system can be a difficult task. Particularly in small and medium-sized
enterprises (SMEs) where robotics expertise is lacking, implementing,
maintaining and developing robotic systems can be a challenge. As a result,
many companies rely on external expertise through system integrators, which, in
some cases, can lead to vendor lock-in and external dependency. In the academic
research on intelligent manufacturing systems, robots play a critical role in
the design of robust autonomous systems. Similar challenges are faced by
researchers who want to use robotic systems as a component in a larger smart
system, without having to deal with the complexity and vastness of the robot
interfaces in detail. In this paper, we propose a software framework that
reduces the effort required to deploy a working robotic system. The focus is
solely on providing a concept for simplifying the different interfaces of a
modern robot system and using an abstraction layer for different manufacturers
and models. The Python programming language is used to implement a prototype of
the concept. The target system is a bin-picking cell containing a Yaskawa
Motoman GP4.

Result: 在仿真和真实机器人实验中，KDPE性能优于Diffusion Policy。

Conclusion: KDPE有效提升机器人策略的鲁棒性和性能，同时保持低计算开销。

Abstract: Learning robot policies that capture multimodality in the training data has
been a long-standing open challenge for behavior cloning. Recent approaches
tackle the problem by modeling the conditional action distribution with
generative models. One of these approaches is Diffusion Policy, which relies on
a diffusion model to denoise random points into robot action trajectories.
While achieving state-of-the-art performance, it has two main drawbacks that
may lead the robot out of the data distribution during policy execution. First,
the stochasticity of the denoising process can highly impact on the quality of
generated trajectory of actions. Second, being a supervised learning approach,
it can learn data outliers from the dataset used for training. Recent work
focuses on mitigating these limitations by combining Diffusion Policy either
with large-scale training or with classical behavior cloning algorithms.
Instead, we propose KDPE, a Kernel Density Estimation-based strategy that
filters out potentially harmful trajectories output of Diffusion Policy while
keeping a low test-time computational overhead. For Kernel Density Estimation,
we propose a manifold-aware kernel to model a probability density function for
actions composed of end-effector Cartesian position, orientation, and gripper
state. KDPE overall achieves better performance than Diffusion Policy on
simulated single-arm tasks and real robot experiments.

Conclusion: MLM框架有效解决了多任务操控问题，并展示了实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Whole-body loco-manipulation for quadruped robots with arm remains a
challenging problem, particularly in achieving multi-task control. To address
this, we propose MLM, a reinforcement learning framework driven by both
real-world and simulation data. It enables a six-DoF robotic arm--equipped
quadruped robot to perform whole-body loco-manipulation for multiple tasks
autonomously or under human teleoperation. To address the problem of balancing
multiple tasks during the learning of loco-manipulation, we introduce a
trajectory library with an adaptive, curriculum-based sampling mechanism. This
approach allows the policy to efficiently leverage real-world collected
trajectories for learning multi-task loco-manipulation. To address deployment
scenarios with only historical observations and to enhance the performance of
policy execution across tasks with different spatial ranges, we propose a
Trajectory-Velocity Prediction policy network. It predicts unobservable future
trajectories and velocities. By leveraging extensive simulation data and
curriculum-based rewards, our controller achieves whole-body behaviors in
simulation and zero-shot transfer to real-world deployment. Ablation studies in
simulation verify the necessity and effectiveness of our approach, while
real-world experiments on the Go2 robot with an Airbot robotic arm demonstrate
the policy's good performance in multi-task execution.

Motivation: 尽管LLMs提升了人机交互质量，但与人类交互相比仍存在不足，且失败案例因情境而异，难以泛化。

Method: 提出使用民族志小故事方法，基于个人经验编写案例，突出多学科视角下的失败。

Result: 小故事能有效揭示罕见失败案例，促进透明度和意外行为的记录。

Conclusion: 建议将小故事作为现有交互评估方法的补充工具。

Abstract: Although the quality of human-robot interactions has improved with the advent
of LLMs, there are still various factors that cause systems to be sub-optimal
when compared to human-human interactions. The nature and criticality of
failures are often dependent on the context of the interaction and so cannot be
generalized across the wide range of scenarios and experiments which have been
implemented in HRI research. In this work we propose the use of a technique
overlooked in the field of HRI, ethnographic vignettes, to clearly highlight
these failures, particularly those that are rarely documented. We describe the
methodology behind the process of writing vignettes and create our own based on
our personal experiences with failures in HRI systems. We emphasize the
strength of vignettes as the ability to communicate failures from a
multi-disciplinary perspective, promote transparency about the capabilities of
robots, and document unexpected behaviours which would otherwise be omitted
from research reports. We encourage the use of vignettes to augment existing
interaction evaluation methods.

Result: 实验验证了该策略在6000 kg WMR上的有效性，确保了系统的稳定性和安全性。

Conclusion: 结合DNN和RAC的分层控制策略能够有效平衡系统鲁棒性和响应性，适用于重型WMR的复杂环境。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) can enable precise control while maintaining low
computational costs by circumventing the need for dynamic modeling. However,
the deployment of such black-box approaches remains challenging for heavy-duty
wheeled mobile robots (WMRs), which are subject to strict international
standards and prone to faults and disturbances. We designed a hierarchical
control policy for heavy-duty WMRs, monitored by two safety layers with
differing levels of authority. To this end, a DNN policy was trained and
deployed as the primary control strategy, providing high-precision performance
under nominal operating conditions. When external disturbances arise and reach
a level of intensity such that the system performance falls below a predefined
threshold, a low-level safety layer intervenes by deactivating the primary
control policy and activating a model-free robust adaptive control (RAC)
policy. This transition enables the system to continue operating while ensuring
stability by effectively managing the inherent trade-off between system
robustness and responsiveness. Regardless of the control policy in use, a
high-level safety layer continuously monitors system performance during
operation. It initiates a shutdown only when disturbances become sufficiently
severe such that compensation is no longer viable and continued operation would
jeopardize the system or its environment. The proposed synthesis of DNN and RAC
policy guarantees uniform exponential stability of the entire WMR system while
adhering to safety standards to some extent. The effectiveness of the proposed
approach was further validated through real-time experiments using a 6,000 kg
WMR.

Abstract: Soft robots, particularly magnetic soft robots, require specialized
simulation tools to accurately model their deformation under external magnetic
fields. However, existing platforms often lack dedicated support for magnetic
materials, making them difficult to use for researchers at different expertise
levels. This work introduces an open-source, user-friendly simulation interface
using the Simulation Open Framework Architecture (SOFA), specifically designed
to model magnetic soft robots. The tool enables users to define material
properties, apply magnetic fields, and observe resulting deformations in real
time. By integrating intuitive controls and stress analysis capabilities, it
aims to bridge the gap between theoretical modeling and practical design. Four
benchmark models - a beam, three- and four-finger grippers, and a butterfly -
demonstrate its functionality. The software's ease of use makes it accessible
to both beginners and advanced researchers. Future improvements will refine
accuracy through experimental validation and comparison with industry-standard
finite element solvers, ensuring realistic and predictive simulations of
magnetic soft robots.

Conclusion: 通过引入显著性区域，可以优化自主探索策略，使其更高效地完成任务。

Abstract: Autonomous exploration is a widely studied problem where a robot
incrementally builds a map of a previously unknown environment. The robot
selects the next locations to reach using an exploration strategy. To do so,
the robot has to balance between competing objectives, like exploring the
entirety of the environment, while being as fast as possible. Most exploration
strategies try to maximise the explored area to speed up exploration; however,
they do not consider that parts of the environment are more important than
others, as they lead to the discovery of large unknown areas. We propose a
method that identifies \emph{saliency areas} as those areas that are of high
interest for exploration, by using saliency maps obtained from a neural network
that, given the current map, implements a termination criterion to estimate
whether the environment can be considered fully-explored or not. We use
saliency areas to bias some widely used exploration strategies, showing, with
an extensive experimental campaign, that this knowledge can significantly
influence the behavior of the robot during exploration.

Abstract: Modern robotic systems, such as mobile manipulators, humanoids, and aerial
robots with arms, often possess high redundancy, enabling them to perform
multiple tasks simultaneously. Managing this redundancy is key to achieving
reliable and flexible behavior. A widely used approach is the Stack of Tasks
(SoT), which organizes control objectives by priority within a unified
framework. However, traditional SoTs are manually designed by experts, limiting
their adaptability and accessibility. This paper introduces a novel framework
that automatically learns both the hierarchy and parameters of a SoT from
user-defined objectives. By combining Reinforcement Learning and Genetic
Programming, the system discovers task priorities and control strategies
without manual intervention. A cost function based on intuitive metrics such as
precision, safety, and execution time guides the learning process. We validate
our method through simulations and experiments on the mobile-YuMi platform, a
dual-arm mobile manipulator with high redundancy. Results show that the learned
SoTs enable the robot to dynamically adapt to changing environments and inputs,
balancing competing objectives while maintaining robust task execution. This
approach provides a general and user-friendly solution for redundancy
management in complex robots, advancing human-centered robot programming and
reducing the need for expert design.

Abstract: Future autonomous systems promise significant societal benefits, yet their
deployment raises concerns about safety and trustworthiness. A key concern is
assuring the reliability of robot perception, as perception seeds safe
decision-making. Failures in perception are often due to complex yet common
environmental factors and can lead to accidents that erode public trust. To
address this concern, we introduce the SET (Self, Environment, and Target)
Perceptual Factors Framework. We designed the framework to systematically
analyze how factors such as weather, occlusion, or sensor limitations
negatively impact perception. To achieve this, the framework employs SET State
Trees to categorize where such factors originate and SET Factor Trees to model
how these sources and factors impact perceptual tasks like object detection or
pose estimation. Next, we develop Perceptual Factor Models using both trees to
quantify the uncertainty for a given task. Our framework aims to promote
rigorous safety assurances and cultivate greater public understanding and trust
in autonomous systems by offering a transparent and standardized method for
identifying, modeling, and communicating perceptual risks.

Abstract: Subjective self-disclosure is an important feature of human social
interaction. While much has been done in the social and behavioural literature
to characterise the features and consequences of subjective self-disclosure,
little work has been done thus far to develop computational systems that are
able to accurately model it. Even less work has been done that attempts to
model specifically how human interactants self-disclose with robotic partners.
It is becoming more pressing as we require social robots to work in conjunction
with and establish relationships with humans in various social settings. In
this paper, our aim is to develop a custom multimodal attention network based
on models from the emotion recognition literature, training this model on a
large self-collected self-disclosure video corpus, and constructing a new loss
function, the scale preserving cross entropy loss, that improves upon both
classification and regression versions of this problem. Our results show that
the best performing model, trained with our novel loss function, achieves an F1
score of 0.83, an improvement of 0.48 from the best baseline model. This result
makes significant headway in the aim of allowing social robots to pick up on an
interaction partner's self-disclosures, an ability that will be essential in
social robots with social cognition.

### [130] [CVIRO: A Consistent and Tightly-Coupled Visual-Inertial-Ranging Odometry on Lie Groups](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10867)
*Yizhi Zhou,Ziwei Kang,Jiawei Xia,Xuan Wang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于李群的紧密耦合视觉-惯性-测距里程计系统（CVIRO），通过联合估计机器人状态和UWB锚点状态，解决了视觉-惯性里程计系统中的漂移问题，并确保估计一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉-惯性里程计（VIO）系统中UWB辅助的估计不一致问题主要由系统可观测性未正确保持和UWB锚点位置假设已知导致校准不确定性忽略引起。

Method: 基于李群构建CVIRO系统，将UWB锚点状态纳入系统状态，显式处理校准不确定性，并利用李群的不变误差特性确保可观测一致性。

Result: 理论证明CVIRO能自然保持系统的正确不可观测子空间，实验表明其定位精度和一致性优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CVIRO通过联合估计和显式处理不确定性，显著提升了UWB辅助VIO系统的定位性能和一致性。

Abstract: Ultra Wideband (UWB) is widely used to mitigate drift in visual-inertial
odometry (VIO) systems. Consistency is crucial for ensuring the estimation
accuracy of a UWBaided VIO system. An inconsistent estimator can degrade
localization performance, where the inconsistency primarily arises from two
main factors: (1) the estimator fails to preserve the correct system
observability, and (2) UWB anchor positions are assumed to be known, leading to
improper neglect of calibration uncertainty. In this paper, we propose a
consistent and tightly-coupled visual-inertial-ranging odometry (CVIRO) system
based on the Lie group. Our method incorporates the UWB anchor state into the
system state, explicitly accounting for UWB calibration uncertainty and
enabling the joint and consistent estimation of both robot and anchor states.
Furthermore, observability consistency is ensured by leveraging the invariant
error properties of the Lie group. We analytically prove that the CVIRO
algorithm naturally maintains the system's correct unobservable subspace,
thereby preserving estimation consistency. Extensive simulations and
experiments demonstrate that CVIRO achieves superior localization accuracy and
consistency compared to existing methods.

*Anantha Narayanan,Battu Bhanu Teja,Pruthwik Mishra*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于强化学习（A2C算法）的框架，用于优化低地球轨道卫星的轨道参数，以实现精确的地面覆盖，并展示了其在性能和收敛速度上的优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低地球轨道日益拥挤，增加了卫星部署和运行的挑战，需要一种高效的方法来优化轨道参数并降低碰撞风险。

Method: 通过将问题建模为马尔可夫决策过程（MDP），在自定义的OpenAI Gymnasium环境中使用A2C算法调整五个轨道参数，以实现目标覆盖。

Result: A2C算法在累积奖励（10.0 vs 9.263025）和收敛速度（2,000 vs 63,000时间步）上优于PPO算法，并能适应多样化的目标坐标。

Conclusion: 该方法证明了强化学习在低地球轨道任务规划中的高效性和可扩展性，为实时任务规划提供了新思路。

Abstract: The increasing congestion of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) poses persistent
challenges to the efficient deployment and safe operation of Earth observation
satellites. Mission planners must now account not only for mission-specific
requirements but also for the increasing collision risk with active satellites
and space debris. This work presents a reinforcement learning framework using
the Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) algorithm to optimize satellite orbital
parameters for precise terrestrial coverage within predefined surface radii. By
formulating the problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) within a custom
OpenAI Gymnasium environment, our method simulates orbital dynamics using
classical Keplerian elements. The agent progressively learns to adjust five of
the orbital parameters - semi-major axis, eccentricity, inclination, right
ascension of ascending node, and the argument of perigee-to achieve targeted
terrestrial coverage. Comparative evaluation against Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO) demonstrates A2C's superior performance, achieving 5.8x
higher cumulative rewards (10.0 vs 9.263025) while converging in 31.5x fewer
timesteps (2,000 vs 63,000). The A2C agent consistently meets mission
objectives across diverse target coordinates while maintaining computational
efficiency suitable for real-time mission planning applications. Key
contributions include: (1) a TLE-based orbital simulation environment
incorporating physics constraints, (2) validation of actor-critic methods'
superiority over trust region approaches in continuous orbital control, and (3)
demonstration of rapid convergence enabling adaptive satellite deployment. This
approach establishes reinforcement learning as a computationally efficient
alternative for scalable and intelligent LEO mission planning.

TL;DR: OpenFPL是一个开源工具，旨在通过公开数据提供高精度的英超梦幻联赛球员表现预测，其准确性可与商业服务媲美。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 商业预测服务依赖专有数据且不透明，OpenFPL旨在通过公开数据提供高精度预测，使更多人受益。

Method: 基于2020-21至2023-24赛季的公开数据，开发了位置特定的集成模型。

Result: OpenFPL在2024-25赛季的测试中表现与商业服务相当，且在高回报球员预测上更优。

Conclusion: OpenFPL为玩家提供了透明、高精度的预测工具，支持长期和短期决策。

Abstract: Fantasy Premier League engages the football community in selecting the
Premier League players who will perform best from gameweek to gameweek. Access
to accurate performance forecasts gives participants an edge over competitors
by guiding expectations about player outcomes and reducing uncertainty in squad
selection. However, high-accuracy forecasts are currently limited to commercial
services whose inner workings are undisclosed and that rely on proprietary
data. This paper aims to democratize access to highly accurate forecasts of
player performance by presenting OpenFPL, an open-source Fantasy Premier League
forecasting method developed exclusively from public data. Comprising
position-specific ensemble models optimized on Fantasy Premier League and
Understat data from four previous seasons (2020-21 to 2023-24), OpenFPL
achieves accuracy comparable to a leading commercial service when tested
prospectively on data from the 2024-25 season. OpenFPL also surpasses the
commercial benchmark for high-return players ($>$ 2 points), which are most
influential for rank gains. These findings hold across one-, two-, and
three-gameweek forecast horizons, supporting long-term planning of transfers
and strategies while also informing final-day decisions.

Conclusion: xRFM在表格数据预测中表现出色，兼具高性能和可解释性。

Abstract: Inference from tabular data, collections of continuous and categorical
variables organized into matrices, is a foundation for modern technology and
science. Yet, in contrast to the explosive changes in the rest of AI, the best
practice for these predictive tasks has been relatively unchanged and is still
primarily based on variations of Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDTs). Very
recently, there has been renewed interest in developing state-of-the-art
methods for tabular data based on recent developments in neural networks and
feature learning methods. In this work, we introduce xRFM, an algorithm that
combines feature learning kernel machines with a tree structure to both adapt
to the local structure of the data and scale to essentially unlimited amounts
of training data.
  We show that compared to $31$ other methods, including recently introduced
tabular foundation models (TabPFNv2) and GBDTs, xRFM achieves best performance
across $100$ regression datasets and is competitive to the best methods across
$200$ classification datasets outperforming GBDTs. Additionally, xRFM provides
interpretability natively through the Average Gradient Outer Product.

Motivation: 解决全球普遍缺乏运动的问题，探索移动健康（mHealth）干预中个性化推送的效果。

Method: 13,463名Fitbit用户被随机分为四组（对照组、随机组、固定组和RL组），RL组通过算法个性化推送运动提醒。

Result: RL组在1个月和2个月时步数显著高于其他组，1个月时平均每天多走296步（p=0.0002）。

Abstract: Consistent physical inactivity poses a major global health challenge. Mobile
health (mHealth) interventions, particularly Just-in-Time Adaptive
Interventions (JITAIs), offer a promising avenue for scalable, personalized
physical activity (PA) promotion. However, developing and evaluating such
interventions at scale, while integrating robust behavioral science, presents
methodological hurdles. The PEARL study was the first large-scale, four-arm
randomized controlled trial to assess a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm,
informed by health behavior change theory, to personalize the content and
timing of PA nudges via a Fitbit app.
  We enrolled and randomized 13,463 Fitbit users into four study arms: control,
random, fixed, and RL. The control arm received no nudges. The other three arms
received nudges from a bank of 155 nudges based on behavioral science
principles. The random arm received nudges selected at random. The fixed arm
received nudges based on a pre-set logic from survey responses about PA
barriers. The RL group received nudges selected by an adaptive RL algorithm. We
included 7,711 participants in primary analyses (mean age 42.1, 86.3% female,
baseline steps 5,618.2).
  We observed an increase in PA for the RL group compared to all other groups
from baseline to 1 and 2 months. The RL group had significantly increased
average daily step count at 1 month compared to all other groups: control (+296
steps, p=0.0002), random (+218 steps, p=0.005), and fixed (+238 steps,
p=0.002). At 2 months, the RL group sustained a significant increase compared
to the control group (+210 steps, p=0.0122). Generalized estimating equation
models also revealed a sustained increase in daily steps in the RL group vs.
control (+208 steps, p=0.002). These findings demonstrate the potential of a
scalable, behaviorally-informed RL approach to personalize digital health
interventions for PA.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 需求计划者更看重预测的一致性和稳定性，而非仅追求准确性提升。模型预测的大幅波动会增加人工干预，降低信任度。

Method: 通过测量Chronos、DeepAR等先进模型在M5和Favorita数据集上的稳定性和准确性，分析集成模型的表现。

Result: 集成模型在不显著降低（甚至提升）准确性的情况下提高了稳定性。

Conclusion: 论文呼吁进一步研究生产系统中部署模型的预测稳定性。

Abstract: Time series forecasting is a critical first step in generating demand plans
for supply chains. Experiments on time series models typically focus on
demonstrating improvements in forecast accuracy over existing/baseline
solutions, quantified according to some accuracy metric. There is no doubt that
forecast accuracy is important; however in production systems, demand planners
often value consistency and stability over incremental accuracy improvements.
Assuming that the inputs have not changed significantly, forecasts that vary
drastically from one planning cycle to the next require high amounts of human
intervention, which frustrates demand planners and can even cause them to lose
trust in ML forecasting models. We study model-induced stochasticity, which
quantifies the variance of a set of forecasts produced by a single model when
the set of inputs is fixed. Models with lower variance are more stable.
  Recently the forecasting community has seen significant advances in forecast
accuracy through the development of deep machine learning models for time
series forecasting. We perform a case study measuring the stability and
accuracy of state-of-the-art forecasting models (Chronos, DeepAR, PatchTST,
Temporal Fusion Transformer, TiDE, and the AutoGluon best quality ensemble) on
public data sets from the M5 competition and Favorita grocery sales. We show
that ensemble models improve stability without significantly deteriorating (or
even improving) forecast accuracy. While these results may not be surprising,
the main point of this paper is to propose the need for further study of
forecast stability for models that are being deployed in production systems.

Conclusion: 该方法为扩散模型提供了一种高效的约束解码方案，适用于形式语言生成任务，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising performance across diverse
domains. Many practical applications of LLMs, such as code completion and
structured data extraction, require adherence to syntactic constraints
specified by a formal language. Yet, due to their probabilistic nature, LLM
output is not guaranteed to adhere to such formal languages. Prior work has
proposed constrained decoding as a means to restrict LLM generation to
particular formal languages. However, existing works are not applicable to the
emerging paradigm of diffusion LLMs, when used in practical scenarios such as
the generation of formally correct C++ or JSON output. In this paper we address
this challenge and present the first constrained decoding method for diffusion
models, one that can handle formal languages captured by context-free grammars.
We begin by reducing constrained decoding to the more general additive
infilling problem, which asks whether a partial output can be completed to a
valid word in the target language. This problem also naturally subsumes the
previously unaddressed multi-region infilling constrained decoding. We then
reduce this problem to the task of deciding whether the intersection of the
target language and a regular language is empty and present an efficient
algorithm to solve it for context-free languages. Empirical results on various
applications, such as C++ code infilling and structured data extraction in
JSON, demonstrate that our method achieves near-perfect syntactic correctness
while consistently preserving or improving functional correctness. Importantly,
our efficiency optimizations ensure that the computational overhead remains
practical.

Abstract: For large language models (LLMs), reasoning over graphs could help solve many
problems. Prior work has tried to improve LLM graph reasoning by examining how
best to serialize graphs as text and by combining GNNs and LLMs. However, the
merits of such approaches remain unclear, so we empirically answer the
following research questions: (1) Can LLMs learn to solve fundamental graph
tasks without specialized graph encoding models?, (2) Can LLMs generalize
learned solutions to unseen graph structures or tasks?, and (3) What are the
merits of competing approaches to learn graph tasks? We show that even small
LLMs can learn to solve graph tasks by training them with instructive
chain-of-thought solutions, and this training generalizes, without specialized
graph encoders, to new tasks and graph structures.

Abstract: Computer-Aided Design (CAD) plays a vital role in engineering and
manufacturing, yet current CAD workflows require extensive domain expertise and
manual modeling effort. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have
made it possible to generate code from natural language, opening new
opportunities for automating parametric 3D modeling. However, directly
translating human design intent into executable CAD code remains highly
challenging, due to the need for logical reasoning, syntactic correctness, and
numerical precision. In this work, we propose CAD-RL, a multimodal
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) guided reinforcement learning post training framework
for CAD modeling code generation. Our method combines CoT-based Cold Start with
goal-driven reinforcement learning post training using three task-specific
rewards: executability reward, geometric accuracy reward, and external
evaluation reward. To ensure stable policy learning under sparse and
high-variance reward conditions, we introduce three targeted optimization
strategies: Trust Region Stretch for improved exploration, Precision Token Loss
for enhanced dimensions parameter accuracy, and Overlong Filtering to reduce
noisy supervision. To support training and benchmarking, we release ExeCAD, a
noval dataset comprising 16,540 real-world CAD examples with paired natural
language and structured design language descriptions, executable CADQuery
scripts, and rendered 3D models. Experiments demonstrate that CAD-RL achieves
significant improvements in reasoning quality, output precision, and code
executability over existing VLMs.

Conclusion: Nested-ReFT在保持性能的同时显著降低了计算成本，为高效强化微调提供了新思路。

Abstract: Advanced reasoning in LLMs on challenging domains like mathematical reasoning
can be tackled using verifiable rewards based reinforced fine-tuning (ReFT). In
standard ReFT frameworks, a behavior model generates multiple completions with
answers per problem, for the answer to be then scored by a reward function.
While such RL post-training methods demonstrate significant performance
improvements across challenging reasoning domains, the computational cost of
generating completions during training with multiple inference steps makes the
training cost non-trivial. To address this, we draw inspiration from off-policy
RL, and speculative decoding to introduce a novel ReFT framework, dubbed
Nested-ReFT, where a subset of layers of the target model acts as the behavior
model to generate off-policy completions during training. The behavior model
configured with dynamic layer skipping per batch during training decreases the
inference cost compared to the standard ReFT frameworks. Our theoretical
analysis shows that Nested-ReFT yields unbiased gradient estimates with
controlled variance. Our empirical analysis demonstrates improved computational
efficiency measured as tokens/sec across multiple math reasoning benchmarks and
model sizes. Additionally, we explore three variants of bias mitigation to
minimize the off-policyness in the gradient updates that allows for maintaining
performance that matches the baseline ReFT performance.

Abstract: Deep neural networks for time series must capture complex temporal patterns,
to effectively represent dynamic data. Self- and semi-supervised learning
methods show promising results in pre-training large models, which -- when
finetuned for classification -- often outperform their counterparts trained
from scratch. Still, the choice of pretext training tasks is often heuristic
and their transferability to downstream classification is not granted, thus we
propose a novel semi-supervised pre-training strategy to enforce latent
representations that satisfy the Neural Collapse phenomenon observed in
optimally trained neural classifiers. We use a rotational equiangular tight
frame-classifier and pseudo-labeling to pre-train deep encoders with few
labeled samples. Furthermore, to effectively capture temporal dynamics while
enforcing embedding separability, we integrate generative pretext tasks with
our method, and we define a novel sequential augmentation strategy. We show
that our method significantly outperforms previous pretext tasks when applied
to LSTMs, transformers, and state-space models on three multivariate time
series classification datasets. These results highlight the benefit of aligning
pre-training objectives with theoretically grounded embedding geometry.

Abstract: Accurate and explainable out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is required to
use machine learning systems safely. Previous work has shown that feature
distance to decision boundaries can be used to identify OOD data effectively.
In this paper, we build on this intuition and propose a post-hoc OOD detection
method that, given an input, calculates the distance to decision boundaries by
leveraging counterfactual explanations. Since computing explanations can be
expensive for large architectures, we also propose strategies to improve
scalability by computing counterfactuals directly in embedding space.
Crucially, as the method employs counterfactual explanations, we can seamlessly
use them to help interpret the results of our detector. We show that our method
is in line with the state of the art on CIFAR-10, achieving 93.50% AUROC and
25.80% FPR95. Our method outperforms these methods on CIFAR-100 with 97.05%
AUROC and 13.79% FPR95 and on ImageNet-200 with 92.55% AUROC and 33.55% FPR95

Abstract: Mixture models have attracted significant attention due to practical
effectiveness and comprehensive theoretical foundations. A persisting challenge
is model misspecification, which occurs when the model to be fitted has more
mixture components than those in the data distribution. In this paper, we
develop a theoretical understanding of the Expectation-Maximization (EM)
algorithm's behavior in the context of targeted model misspecification for
overspecified two-component Mixed Linear Regression (2MLR) with unknown
$d$-dimensional regression parameters and mixing weights. In Theorem 5.1 at the
population level, with an unbalanced initial guess for mixing weights, we
establish linear convergence of regression parameters in $O(\log(1/\epsilon))$
steps. Conversely, with a balanced initial guess for mixing weights, we observe
sublinear convergence in $O(\epsilon^{-2})$ steps to achieve the
$\epsilon$-accuracy at Euclidean distance. In Theorem 6.1 at the finite-sample
level, for mixtures with sufficiently unbalanced fixed mixing weights, we
demonstrate a statistical accuracy of $O((d/n)^{1/2})$, whereas for those with
sufficiently balanced fixed mixing weights, the accuracy is $O((d/n)^{1/4})$
given $n$ data samples. Furthermore, we underscore the connection between our
population level and finite-sample level results: by setting the desired final
accuracy $\epsilon$ in Theorem 5.1 to match that in Theorem 6.1 at the
finite-sample level, namely letting $\epsilon = O((d/n)^{1/2})$ for
sufficiently unbalanced fixed mixing weights and $\epsilon = O((d/n)^{1/4})$
for sufficiently balanced fixed mixing weights, we intuitively derive iteration
complexity bounds $O(\log (1/\epsilon))=O(\log (n/d))$ and
$O(\epsilon^{-2})=O((n/d)^{1/2})$ at the finite-sample level for sufficiently
unbalanced and balanced initial mixing weights. We further extend our analysis
in overspecified setting to low SNR regime.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文探讨了推理语言模型的评估，指出性能提升不仅源于算法改进或模型规模，还依赖于有影响力的基准测试作为学习课程。通过DeepSeek-R1实验，展示了基准驱动选择对AI发展的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着推理成为大型语言模型的重要扩展方向，需要深入研究其在关键任务中的能力，并揭示性能提升的真正原因。

Method: 通过实验验证基准测试作为学习课程的效果，使用DeepSeek-R1模型和Humanity's Last Exam的序列决策问题。

Result: 研究表明，性能提升部分源于基准测试的选择，而非仅依赖算法或模型规模。

Conclusion: 基准测试可作为训练课程而非单纯测试集，其新颖性是衡量推理模型泛化能力的关键。

Abstract: Evaluation of reasoning language models gained importance after it was
observed that they can combine their existing capabilities into novel traces of
intermediate steps before task completion and that the traces can sometimes
help them to generalize better than past models. As reasoning becomes the next
scaling dimension of large language models, careful study of their capabilities
in critical tasks is needed. We show that better performance is not always
caused by test-time algorithmic improvements or model sizes but also by using
impactful benchmarks as curricula for learning. We call this benchmark-driven
selection of AI and show its effects on DeepSeek-R1 using our sequential
decision-making problem from Humanity's Last Exam. Steering development of AI
by impactful benchmarks trades evaluation for learning and makes novelty of
test tasks key for measuring generalization capabilities of reasoning models.
Consequently, some benchmarks could be seen as curricula for training rather
than unseen test sets.

Abstract: Monitoring cattle health and optimizing yield are key challenges faced by
dairy farmers due to difficulties in tracking all animals on the farm. This
work aims to showcase modern data-driven farming practices based on explainable
machine learning(ML) methods that explain the activity and behaviour of dairy
cattle (cows). Continuous data collection of 3-axis accelerometer sensors and
usage of robust ML methodologies and algorithms, provide farmers and
researchers with actionable information on cattle activity, allowing farmers to
make informed decisions and incorporate sustainable practices. This study
utilizes Bluetooth-based Internet of Things (IoT) devices and 4G networks for
seamless data transmission, immediate analysis, inference generation, and
explains the models performance with explainability frameworks. Special
emphasis is put on the pre-processing of the accelerometers time series data,
including the extraction of statistical characteristics, signal processing
techniques, and lag-based features using the sliding window technique. Various
hyperparameter-optimized ML models are evaluated across varying window lengths
for activity classification. The k-nearest neighbour Classifier achieved the
best performance, with AUC of mean 0.98 and standard deviation of 0.0026 on the
training set and 0.99 on testing set). In order to ensure transparency,
Explainable AI based frameworks such as SHAP is used to interpret feature
importance that can be understood and used by practitioners. A detailed
comparison of the important features, along with the stability analysis of
selected features, supports development of explainable and practical ML models
for sustainable livestock management.

TL;DR: AI分析象牙上的手写标记，为打击跨国象牙贸易提供低成本、可扩展的取证方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跨国象牙贸易导致非洲象数量持续下降，但现有取证方法（如DNA分析）成本高且有时不可行，而手写标记虽易获取却未被充分利用。

Method: 通过AI驱动的流程，从6,085张象牙照片中提取并分析17,000多个手写标记，识别出184个重复出现的“签名标记”，并建立不同查获批次间的关联。

Result: 发现20个签名标记出现在多个查获批次中，证明这些批次由同一贩运网络操作。

Conclusion: AI手写标记分析填补了其他取证方法的空白，展示了AI在野生动物取证中的潜力，为打击有组织野生动物犯罪提供了新工具。

Abstract: The transnational ivory trade continues to drive the decline of elephant
populations across Africa, and trafficking networks remain difficult to
disrupt. Tusks seized by law enforcement officials carry forensic information
on the traffickers responsible for their export, including DNA evidence and
handwritten markings made by traffickers. For 20 years, analyses of tusk DNA
have identified where elephants were poached and established connections among
shipments of ivory. While the links established using genetic evidence are
extremely conclusive, genetic data is expensive and sometimes impossible to
obtain. But though handwritten markings are easy to photograph, they are rarely
documented or analyzed. Here, we present an AI-driven pipeline for extracting
and analyzing handwritten markings on seized elephant tusks, offering a novel,
scalable, and low-cost source of forensic evidence. Having collected 6,085
photographs from eight large seizures of ivory over a 6-year period
(2014-2019), we used an object detection model to extract over 17,000
individual markings, which were then labeled and described using
state-of-the-art AI tools. We identified 184 recurring "signature markings"
that connect the tusks on which they appear. 20 signature markings were
observed in multiple seizures, establishing forensic links between these
seizures through traffickers involved in both shipments. This work complements
other investigative techniques by filling in gaps where other data sources are
unavailable. The study demonstrates the transformative potential of AI in
wildlife forensics and highlights practical steps for integrating handwriting
analysis into efforts to disrupt organized wildlife crime.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索量子退火器在RBM采样中的潜力，以改进对比散度学习的效果。

Method: 使用D-Wave量子退火器和Gibbs采样获取RBM样本，比较局部谷数量和能量。

Result: D-Wave采样覆盖更多局部谷，但与Gibbs采样的重叠较少，且未显著提升采样质量。

Conclusion: 量子退火器在RBM采样中潜力有限，但结合经典-量子方法可能有改进空间。

Abstract: A local-valley (LV) centered approach to assessing the quality of sampling
from Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) was applied to the latest generation
of the D-Wave quantum annealer. D-Wave and Gibbs samples from a classically
trained RBM were obtained at conditions relevant to the
contrastive-divergence-based RBM learning. The samples were compared for the
number of the LVs to which they belonged and the energy of the corresponding
local minima. No significant (desirable) increase in the number of the LVs has
been achieved by decreasing the D-Wave annealing time. At any training epoch,
the states sampled by the D-Wave belonged to a somewhat higher number of LVs
than in the Gibbs sampling. However, many of those LVs found by the two
techniques differed. For high-probability sampled states, the two techniques
were (unfavorably) less complementary and more overlapping. Nevertheless, many
potentially "important" local minima, i.e., those having intermediate, even if
not high, probability values, were found by only one of the two sampling
techniques while missed by the other. The two techniques overlapped less at
later than earlier training epochs, which is precisely the stage of the
training when modest improvements to the sampling quality could make meaningful
differences for the RBM trainability. The results of this work may explain the
failure of previous investigations to achieve substantial (or any) improvement
when using D-Wave-based sampling. However, the results reveal some potential
for improvement, e.g., using a combined classical-quantum approach.

TL;DR: 该研究开发了一种可解释的机器学习模型，用于早期预测肝硬化重症患者的急性肾损伤（AKI）。LightGBM模型表现最佳，具有高准确性和负预测值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 肝硬化患者中AKI发生率高且预后差，现有预测工具缺乏准确性和可解释性。研究旨在开发一种适合ICU工作流程的早期预测模型。

Method: 研究回顾性分析了MIMIC-IV v2.2数据库，提取了1240名肝硬化ICU患者的数据，通过预处理、特征选择和算法训练（包括LightGBM等）构建模型。

Result: LightGBM模型表现最佳（AUROC 0.808，准确性0.704），关键预测因子包括部分凝血活酶时间延长、pH值低等。

Conclusion: 该模型能准确早期预测肝硬化患者的AKI风险，高负预测值支持低风险患者的降级管理，可解释性有助于临床信任和针对性预防。

Abstract: Background: Cirrhosis is a progressive liver disease with high mortality and
frequent complications, notably acute kidney injury (AKI), which occurs in up
to 50% of hospitalized patients and worsens outcomes. AKI stems from complex
hemodynamic, inflammatory, and metabolic changes, making early detection
essential. Many predictive tools lack accuracy, interpretability, and alignment
with intensive care unit (ICU) workflows. This study developed an interpretable
machine learning model for early AKI prediction in critically ill patients with
cirrhosis.
  Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of the MIMIC-IV v2.2 database,
identifying 1240 adult ICU patients with cirrhosis and excluding those with ICU
stays under 48 hours or missing key data. Laboratory and physiological
variables from the first 48 hours were extracted. The pipeline included
preprocessing, missingness filtering, LASSO feature selection, and SMOTE class
balancing. Six algorithms-LightGBM, CatBoost, XGBoost, logistic regression,
naive Bayes, and neural networks-were trained and evaluated using AUROC,
accuracy, F1-score, sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values.
  Results: LightGBM achieved the best performance (AUROC 0.808, 95% CI
0.741-0.856; accuracy 0.704; NPV 0.911). Key predictors included prolonged
partial thromboplastin time, absence of outside-facility 20G placement, low pH,
and altered pO2, consistent with known cirrhosis-AKI mechanisms and suggesting
actionable targets.
  Conclusion: The LightGBM-based model enables accurate early AKI risk
stratification in ICU patients with cirrhosis using routine clinical variables.
Its high negative predictive value supports safe de-escalation for low-risk
patients, and interpretability fosters clinician trust and targeted prevention.
External validation and integration into electronic health record systems are
warranted.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文探讨了基于Transformer的语言模型在上下文学习（ICL）中的应用，特别是针对密码函数（如替换密码和Vigenère密码）的学习能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探索ICL在密码学领域的潜力，评估Transformer模型在结构化推理任务中的归纳偏差和泛化能力。

Method: 通过提供少量（密文、明文）对，让模型推断隐藏的双射映射，从而解码新密文。

Result: 结果表明Transformer模型能够通过ICL学习密码函数并完成解码任务。

Conclusion: ICL在密码学领域具有潜力，为结构化推理任务提供了新的研究方向。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) has emerged as a powerful capability of
transformer-based language models, enabling them to perform tasks by
conditioning on a small number of examples presented at inference time, without
any parameter updates. Prior work has shown that transformers can generalize
over simple function classes like linear functions, decision trees, even neural
networks, purely from context, focusing on numerical or symbolic reasoning over
underlying well-structured functions. Instead, we propose a novel application
of ICL into the domain of cryptographic function learning, specifically
focusing on ciphers such as mono-alphabetic substitution and Vigen\`ere
ciphers, two classes of private-key encryption schemes. These ciphers involve a
fixed but hidden bijective mapping between plain text and cipher text
characters. Given a small set of (cipher text, plain text) pairs, the goal is
for the model to infer the underlying substitution and decode a new cipher text
word. This setting poses a structured inference challenge, which is well-suited
for evaluating the inductive biases and generalization capabilities of
transformers under the ICL paradigm. Code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需重新训练的新型后门攻击方法HPMI，通过剪枝和注入恶意头实现，具有高隐蔽性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有后门攻击方法依赖重新训练或修改模型架构，资源消耗大且侵入性强，HPMI旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 剪枝最不重要的头并注入预训练的恶意头，无需重新训练或修改架构。

Result: 实验显示HPMI攻击成功率达99.55%，且能绕过四种先进防御机制，对干净数据准确性影响极小。

Conclusion: HPMI是一种高效、隐蔽且鲁棒的后门攻击方法，优于现有依赖重新训练的攻击。

Abstract: Transformer models have demonstrated exceptional performance and have become
indispensable in computer vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP)
tasks. However, recent studies reveal that transformers are susceptible to
backdoor attacks. Prior backdoor attack methods typically rely on retraining
with clean data or altering the model architecture, both of which can be
resource-intensive and intrusive. In this paper, we propose Head-wise Pruning
and Malicious Injection (HPMI), a novel retraining-free backdoor attack on
transformers that does not alter the model's architecture. Our approach
requires only a small subset of the original data and basic knowledge of the
model architecture, eliminating the need for retraining the target transformer.
Technically, HPMI works by pruning the least important head and injecting a
pre-trained malicious head to establish the backdoor. We provide a rigorous
theoretical justification demonstrating that the implanted backdoor resists
detection and removal by state-of-the-art defense techniques, under reasonable
assumptions. Experimental evaluations across multiple datasets further validate
the effectiveness of HPMI, showing that it 1) incurs negligible clean accuracy
loss, 2) achieves at least 99.55% attack success rate, and 3) bypasses four
advanced defense mechanisms. Additionally, relative to state-of-the-art
retraining-dependent attacks, HPMI achieves greater concealment and robustness
against diverse defense strategies, while maintaining minimal impact on clean
accuracy.

Abstract: In this current work, we propose a Max Min approach for approximating

to develop the Max Min Kantorovich-type exponential neural network operators
and investigate their approximation properties. We study both pointwise and
uniform convergence for univariate functions. To analyze the order of
convergence, we use the logarithmic modulus of continuity and estimate the
corresponding rate of convergence. Furthermore, we examine the convergence
behavior of the Max Min Kantorovich type exponential neural network operators
within the Orlicz space setting. We provide some graphical representations to
illustrate the approximation error of the function through suitable kernel and
sigmoidal activation functions.

Conclusion: 该方法在真实大规模调度环境中表现出色，具有强泛化能力和实用价值。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges of high resource dynamism and scheduling
complexity in cloud-native database systems. It proposes an adaptive resource
orchestration method based on multi-agent reinforcement learning. The method
introduces a heterogeneous role-based agent modeling mechanism. This allows
different resource entities, such as compute nodes, storage nodes, and
schedulers, to adopt distinct policy representations. These agents are better
able to reflect diverse functional responsibilities and local environmental
characteristics within the system. A reward-shaping mechanism is designed to
integrate local observations with global feedback. This helps mitigate policy
learning bias caused by incomplete state observations. By combining real-time
local performance signals with global system value estimation, the mechanism
improves coordination among agents and enhances policy convergence stability. A
unified multi-agent training framework is developed and evaluated on a
representative production scheduling dataset. Experimental results show that
the proposed method outperforms traditional approaches across multiple key
metrics. These include resource utilization, scheduling latency, policy
convergence speed, system stability, and fairness. The results demonstrate
strong generalization and practical utility. Across various experimental
scenarios, the method proves effective in handling orchestration tasks with
high concurrency, high-dimensional state spaces, and complex dependency
relationships. This confirms its advantages in real-world, large-scale
scheduling environments.

Conclusion: 该方法在多租户云环境中具有智能资源监控和异常诊断的实际潜力。

Abstract: This paper proposes an anomaly detection method based on federated learning
to address key challenges in multi-tenant cloud environments, including data
privacy leakage, heterogeneous resource behavior, and the limitations of
centralized modeling. The method establishes a federated training framework
involving multiple tenants. Each tenant trains the model locally using private
resource usage data. Through parameter aggregation, a global model is
optimized, enabling cross-tenant collaborative anomaly detection while
preserving data privacy. To improve adaptability to diverse resource usage
patterns, a personalized parameter adjustment mechanism is introduced. This
allows the model to retain tenant-specific feature representations while
sharing global knowledge. In the model output stage, the Mahalanobis distance
is used to compute anomaly scores. This enhances both the accuracy and
stability of anomaly detection. The experiments use real telemetry data from a
cloud platform to construct a simulated multi-tenant environment. The study
evaluates the model's performance under varying participation rates and noise
injection levels. These comparisons demonstrate the proposed method's
robustness and detection accuracy. Experimental results show that the proposed
method outperforms existing mainstream models across key metrics such as
Precision, Recall, and F1-Score. It also maintains stable performance in
various complex scenarios. These findings highlight the method's practical
potential for intelligent resource monitoring and anomaly diagnosis in cloud
computing environments.

Motivation: 现有在线学习方法无法有效利用重复偏移，而基于模型池的方法难以捕捉单个源组件，导致适应性能不佳。

Method: 通过EM算法离线分解源组件并学习预测模型，再通过在线凸优化更新混合权重以实现精确预测。

Result: 在多个真实回归数据集上实验表明，该方法将累积测试损失降低了高达67.4%。

Conclusion: 该方法充分挖掘偏移特性，实现了优于现有方法的适应性能。

Abstract: This paper addresses source component shift adaptation, aiming to update
predictions adapting to source component shifts for incoming data streams based
on past training data. Existing online learning methods often fail to utilize
recurring shifts effectively, while model-pool-based methods struggle to
capture individual source components, leading to poor adaptation. In this
paper, we propose a source component shift adaptation method via an offline
decomposition and online mixing approach. We theoretically identify that the
problem can be divided into two subproblems: offline source component
decomposition and online mixing weight adaptation. Based on this, our method
first determines prediction models, each of which learns a source component
solely based on past training data offline through the EM algorithm. Then, it
updates the mixing weight of the prediction models for precise prediction
through online convex optimization. Thanks to our theoretical derivation, our
method fully leverages the characteristics of the shifts, achieving superior
adaptation performance over existing methods. Experiments conducted on various
real-world regression datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms
baselines, reducing the cumulative test loss by up to 67.4%.

Result: 框架在减少预测区间长度的同时实现了边际覆盖，为短期和长期规划提供了精确预测。

Conclusion: 通过量化不确定性，该方法支持基于证据的左旋多巴剂量决策，优化症状控制并提高生活质量。

Abstract: Parkinson's Disease (PD) medication management presents unique challenges due
to heterogeneous disease progression and treatment response. Neurologists must
balance symptom control with optimal dopaminergic dosing based on functional
disability while minimizing side effects. This balance is crucial as inadequate
or abrupt changes can cause levodopa-induced dyskinesia, wearing off, and
neuropsychiatric effects, significantly reducing quality of life. Current
approaches rely on trial-and-error decisions without systematic predictive
methods. Despite machine learning advances, clinical adoption remains limited
due to reliance on point predictions that do not account for prediction
uncertainty, undermining clinical trust and utility. Clinicians require not
only predictions of future medication needs but also reliable confidence
measures. Without quantified uncertainty, adjustments risk premature escalation
to maximum doses or prolonged inadequate symptom control. We developed a
conformal prediction framework anticipating medication needs up to two years in
advance with reliable prediction intervals and statistical guarantees. Our
approach addresses zero-inflation in PD inpatient data, where patients maintain
stable medication regimens between visits. Using electronic health records from
631 inpatient admissions at University of Florida Health (2011-2021), our
two-stage approach identifies patients likely to need medication changes, then
predicts required levodopa equivalent daily dose adjustments. Our framework
achieved marginal coverage while reducing prediction interval lengths compared
to traditional approaches, providing precise predictions for short-term
planning and wider ranges for long-term forecasting. By quantifying
uncertainty, our approach enables evidence-based decisions about levodopa
dosing, optimizing symptom control while minimizing side effects and improving
life quality.

Conclusion: SynBrain不仅性能优越，还能揭示跨试验和被试的功能一致性，具有生物学解释性。

Abstract: Deciphering how visual stimuli are transformed into cortical responses is a
fundamental challenge in computational neuroscience. This visual-to-neural
mapping is inherently a one-to-many relationship, as identical visual inputs
reliably evoke variable hemodynamic responses across trials, contexts, and
subjects. However, existing deterministic methods struggle to simultaneously
model this biological variability while capturing the underlying functional
consistency that encodes stimulus information. To address these limitations, we
propose SynBrain, a generative framework that simulates the transformation from
visual semantics to neural responses in a probabilistic and biologically
interpretable manner. SynBrain introduces two key components: (i) BrainVAE
models neural representations as continuous probability distributions via
probabilistic learning while maintaining functional consistency through visual
semantic constraints; (ii) A Semantic-to-Neural Mapper acts as a semantic
transmission pathway, projecting visual semantics into the neural response
manifold to facilitate high-fidelity fMRI synthesis. Experimental results
demonstrate that SynBrain surpasses state-of-the-art methods in
subject-specific visual-to-fMRI encoding performance. Furthermore, SynBrain
adapts efficiently to new subjects with few-shot data and synthesizes
high-quality fMRI signals that are effective in improving data-limited
fMRI-to-image decoding performance. Beyond that, SynBrain reveals functional
consistency across trials and subjects, with synthesized signals capturing
interpretable patterns shaped by biological neural variability. The code will
be made publicly available.

Result: 在皮肤病、胸部X光和视网膜OCT数据集上，FedKEI优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FedKEI能有效利用历史知识快速适应新任务，适用于多模态医疗数据。

Abstract: In healthcare, federated learning (FL) is a widely adopted framework that
enables privacy-preserving collaboration among medical institutions. With large
foundation models (FMs) demonstrating impressive capabilities, using FMs in FL
through cost-efficient adapter tuning has become a popular approach. Given the
rapidly evolving healthcare environment, it is crucial for individual clients
to quickly adapt to new tasks or diseases by tuning adapters while drawing upon
past experiences. In this work, we introduce Federated Knowledge-Enhanced
Initialization (FedKEI), a novel framework that leverages cross-client and
cross-task transfer from past knowledge to generate informed initializations
for learning new tasks with adapters. FedKEI begins with a global clustering
process at the server to generalize knowledge across tasks, followed by the
optimization of aggregation weights across clusters (inter-cluster weights) and
within each cluster (intra-cluster weights) to personalize knowledge transfer
for each new task. To facilitate more effective learning of the inter- and
intra-cluster weights, we adopt a bi-level optimization scheme that
collaboratively learns the global intra-cluster weights across clients and
optimizes the local inter-cluster weights toward each client's task objective.
Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets of different modalities,
including dermatology, chest X-rays, and retinal OCT, demonstrate FedKEI's
advantage in adapting to new diseases compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Method: CLIP-Fed结合预聚合和后聚合防御策略，利用多模态大语言模型和频率分析构建服务器数据集，并通过原型对比损失和KL散度对齐全局模型与CLIP的知识。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和CIFAR-10-LT数据集上，CLIP-Fed平均降低了ASR（2.03%和1.35%），同时提升了MA（7.92%和0.48%）。

Conclusion: CLIP-Fed在异构数据分布下有效防御后门攻击，同时显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Existing backdoor defense methods in Federated Learning (FL) rely on the
assumption of homogeneous client data distributions or the availability of a
clean serve dataset, which limits the practicality and effectiveness. Defending
against backdoor attacks under heterogeneous client data distributions while
preserving model performance remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we
propose a FL backdoor defense framework named CLIP-Fed, which leverages the
zero-shot learning capabilities of vision-language pre-training models. By
integrating both pre-aggregation and post-aggregation defense strategies,
CLIP-Fed overcomes the limitations of Non-IID imposed on defense effectiveness.
To address privacy concerns and enhance the coverage of the dataset against
diverse triggers, we construct and augment the server dataset using the
multimodal large language model and frequency analysis without any client
samples. To address class prototype deviations caused by backdoor samples and
eliminate the correlation between trigger patterns and target labels, CLIP-Fed
aligns the knowledge of the global model and CLIP on the augmented dataset
using prototype contrastive loss and Kullback-Leibler divergence. Extensive
experiments on representative datasets validate the effectiveness of CLIP-Fed.
Compared to state-of-the-art methods, CLIP-Fed achieves an average reduction in
ASR, i.e., 2.03\% on CIFAR-10 and 1.35\% on CIFAR-10-LT, while improving
average MA by 7.92\% and 0.48\%, respectively.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于福利的公平聚类方法，通过距离和比例代表建模群体效用，并提出了两种优化目标和相应算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统公平聚类方法可能产生不理想的结果，因此需要一种福利中心的方法来更合理地建模群体效用。

Method: 基于距离和比例代表建模群体效用，提出Rawlsian和Utilitarian两种优化目标，并设计新算法。

Result: 在多个真实数据集上，新方法显著优于现有公平聚类基线。

Conclusion: 福利中心的公平聚类方法能更有效地满足群体需求，优于传统方法。

Abstract: Fair clustering has traditionally focused on ensuring equitable group
representation or equalizing group-specific clustering costs. However,
Dickerson et al. (2025) recently showed that these fairness notions may yield
undesirable or unintuitive clustering outcomes and advocated for a
welfare-centric clustering approach that models the utilities of the groups. In
this work, we model group utilities based on both distances and proportional
representation and formalize two optimization objectives based on
welfare-centric clustering: the Rawlsian (Egalitarian) objective and the
Utilitarian objective. We introduce novel algorithms for both objectives and
prove theoretical guarantees for them. Empirical evaluations on multiple
real-world datasets demonstrate that our methods significantly outperform
existing fair clustering baselines.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种多层次的IoMT入侵检测系统框架，能够检测零日攻击并区分已知和未知威胁，实验结果显示高准确性和F1分数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: IoMT设备易受网络攻击，传统集中式IDS因延迟和隐私问题不适用，本地运行IDS又受限于设备资源。

Method: 采用多层次框架，第一层使用元学习或OCC算法粗筛流量，后续层识别攻击类型和新颖性。

Result: 在CICIoMT2024数据集上达到99.77%准确率和97.8% F1分数，第一层能高精度检测零日攻击。

Conclusion: 该框架在IoMT环境中具有强适用性，能有效应对零日攻击和资源限制问题。

Abstract: The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is driving a healthcare revolution but
remains vulnerable to cyberattacks such as denial of service, ransomware, data
hijacking, and spoofing. These networks comprise resource constrained,
heterogeneous devices (e.g., wearable sensors, smart pills, implantables),
making traditional centralized Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) unsuitable
due to response delays, privacy risks, and added vulnerabilities. Centralized
IDSs require all sensors to transmit data to a central server, causing delays
or network disruptions in dense environments. Running IDSs locally on IoMT
devices is often infeasible due to limited computation, and even lightweight
IDS components remain at risk if updated models are delayed leaving them
exposed to zero-day attacks that threaten patient health and data security. We
propose a multi level IoMT IDS framework capable of detecting zero day attacks
and distinguishing between known and unknown threats. The first layer (near
Edge) filters traffic at a coarse level (attack or not) using meta-learning or
One Class Classification (OCC) with the usfAD algorithm. Subsequent layers (far
Edge, Cloud) identify attack type and novelty. Experiments on the CICIoMT2024
dataset show 99.77 percentage accuracy and 97.8 percentage F1-score. The first
layer detects zero-day attacks with high accuracy without needing new datasets,
ensuring strong applicability in IoMT environments. Additionally, the
meta-learning approach achieves high.

Result: 实验表明，系统条件对学习速率和性能有重要影响，揭示了即时性能与适应能力之间的权衡。

Conclusion: 本文首次严格描述了语义通信中的统计学习，并提供了平衡即时性能与适应能力的设计原则。

Abstract: Semantic communication aims to convey meaning rather than bit-perfect
reproduction, representing a paradigm shift from traditional communication.
This paper investigates distribution learning in semantic communication where
receivers must infer the underlying meaning distribution through sequential
observations. While semantic communication traditionally optimizes individual
meaning transmission, we establish fundamental conditions for learning source
statistics when priors are unknown. We prove that learnability requires full
rank of the effective transmission matrix, characterize the convergence rate of
distribution estimation, and quantify how estimation errors translate to
semantic distortion. Our analysis reveals a fundamental trade-off: encoding
schemes optimized for immediate semantic performance often sacrifice long-term
learnability. Experiments on CIFAR-10 validate our theoretical framework,
demonstrating that system conditioning critically impacts both learning rate
and achievable performance. These results provide the first rigorous
characterization of statistical learning in semantic communication and offer
design principles for systems that balance immediate performance with
adaptation capability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mamba模型在边缘设备上的部署缺乏优化的硬件加速框架，eMamba旨在填补这一空白。

Method: eMamba采用轻量化归一化层替代和近似操作，结合近似感知的神经架构搜索（NAS）优化参数。

Result: 在多个数据集上，eMamba参数减少1.63-19.9倍，FPGA和ASIC实现中延迟降低4.95-5.62倍，吞吐量提高2.22-9.95倍。

Conclusion: eMamba在边缘设备上高效部署Mamba模型，显著提升性能并降低资源消耗。

Abstract: State Space Model (SSM)-based machine learning architectures have recently
gained significant attention for processing sequential data. Mamba, a recent
sequence-to-sequence SSM, offers competitive accuracy with superior
computational efficiency compared to state-of-the-art transformer models. While
this advantage makes Mamba particularly promising for resource-constrained edge
devices, no hardware acceleration frameworks are currently optimized for
deploying it in such environments. This paper presents eMamba, a comprehensive
end-to-end hardware acceleration framework explicitly designed for deploying
Mamba models on edge platforms. eMamba maximizes computational efficiency by
replacing complex normalization layers with lightweight hardware-aware
alternatives and approximating expensive operations, such as SiLU activation
and exponentiation, considering the target applications. Then, it performs an
approximation-aware neural architecture search (NAS) to tune the learnable
parameters used during approximation. Evaluations with Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10,
and MARS, an open-source human pose estimation dataset, show eMamba achieves
comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art techniques using 1.63-19.9$\times$
fewer parameters. In addition, it generalizes well to large-scale natural
language tasks, demonstrating stable perplexity across varying sequence lengths
on the WikiText2 dataset. We also quantize and implement the entire eMamba
pipeline on an AMD ZCU102 FPGA and ASIC using GlobalFoundries (GF) 22 nm
technology. Experimental results show 4.95-5.62$\times$ lower latency and
2.22-9.95$\times$ higher throughput, with 4.77$\times$ smaller area,
9.84$\times$ lower power, and 48.6$\times$ lower energy consumption than
baseline solutions while maintaining competitive accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ITL方法缺乏评估其是否真正捕捉标注者个体倾向并提供有意义的解释分析的框架。

Method: 提出了两种新指标：DIC（量化模型捕捉标注者倾向的能力）和BAE（评估模型解释与标注者行为的对齐程度）。

Result: 实验验证了所提评估框架的有效性。

Conclusion: 该框架填补了ITL方法评估的空白，为理解标注者决策提供了工具。

Abstract: Recent works have emerged in multi-annotator learning that shift focus from
Consensus-oriented Learning (CoL), which aggregates multiple annotations into a
single ground-truth prediction, to Individual Tendency Learning (ITL), which
models annotator-specific labeling behavior patterns (i.e., tendency) to
provide explanation analysis for understanding annotator decisions. However, no
evaluation framework currently exists to assess whether ITL methods truly
capture individual tendencies and provide meaningful behavioral explanations.
To address this gap, we propose the first unified evaluation framework with two
novel metrics: (1) Difference of Inter-annotator Consistency (DIC) quantifies
how well models capture annotator tendencies by comparing predicted
inter-annotator similarity structures with ground-truth; (2) Behavior Alignment
Explainability (BAE) evaluates how well model explanations reflect annotator
behavior and decision relevance by aligning explainability-derived with
ground-truth labeling similarity structures via Multidimensional Scaling (MDS).
Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our proposed evaluation
framework.

TL;DR: XQuant通过低比特量化和动态重计算KV缓存，显著减少LLM推理的内存消耗，同时保持高精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM推理面临内存和带宽瓶颈，而计算能力持续提升，XQuant利用这一趋势，通过量化技术减少内存操作。

Method: 量化并缓存层输入激活X，动态重计算KV，利用跨层相似性进一步压缩（XQuant-CL）。

Result: XQuant实现7.7倍内存节省，XQuant-CL达10-12.5倍节省，精度损失极小。

Conclusion: XQuant通过计算换内存，显著优化LLM推理，超越现有KV缓存量化方法。

Abstract: Although LLM inference has emerged as a critical workload for many downstream
applications, efficiently inferring LLMs is challenging due to the substantial
memory footprint and bandwidth requirements. In parallel, compute capabilities
have steadily outpaced both memory capacity and bandwidth over the last few
decades, a trend that remains evident in modern GPU hardware and exacerbates
the challenge of LLM inference. As such, new algorithms are emerging that trade
increased computation for reduced memory operations. To that end, we present
XQuant, which takes advantage of this trend, enabling an order-of-magnitude
reduction in memory consumption through low-bit quantization with substantial
accuracy benefits relative to state-of-the-art KV cache quantization methods.
We accomplish this by quantizing and caching the layer input activations X,
instead of using standard KV caching, and then rematerializing the Keys and
Values on-the-fly during inference. This results in an immediate 2$\times$
memory savings compared to KV caching. By applying XQuant, we achieve up to
$\sim 7.7\times$ memory savings with $<0.1$ perplexity degradation compared to
the FP16 baseline. Furthermore, our approach leverages the fact that X values
are similar across layers. Building on this observation, we introduce
XQuant-CL, which exploits the cross-layer similarity in the X embeddings for
extreme compression. Across different models, XQuant-CL attains up to
10$\times$ memory savings relative to the FP16 baseline with only 0.01
perplexity degradation, and 12.5$\times$ memory savings with only $0.1$
perplexity degradation. XQuant exploits the rapidly increasing compute
capabilities of hardware platforms to eliminate the memory bottleneck, while
surpassing state-of-the-art KV cache quantization methods and achieving
near-FP16 accuracy across a wide range of models.

Conclusion: SC2Arena和StarEvolve填补了现有基准测试的不足，为复杂决策任务提供了更全面的评估工具。

Abstract: Evaluating large language models (LLMs) in complex decision-making is
essential for advancing AI's ability for strategic planning and real-time
adaptation. However, existing benchmarks for tasks like StarCraft II fail to
capture the game's full complexity, such as its complete game context, diverse
action spaces, and all playable races. To address this gap, we present
SC2Arena, a benchmark that fully supports all playable races, low-level action
spaces, and optimizes text-based observations to tackle spatial reasoning
challenges. Complementing this, we introduce StarEvolve, a hierarchical
framework that integrates strategic planning with tactical execution, featuring
iterative self-correction and continuous improvement via fine-tuning on
high-quality gameplay data. Its key components include a
Planner-Executor-Verifier structure to break down gameplay, and a scoring
system for selecting high-quality training samples. Comprehensive analysis
using SC2Arena provides valuable insights into developing generalist agents
that were not possible with previous benchmarks. Experimental results also
demonstrate that our proposed StarEvolve achieves superior performance in
strategic planning. Our code, environment, and algorithms are publicly
available.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SAM在过参数化模型中提升泛化能力，但其在张量化和尺度不变模型中的行为研究不足。本文通过尺度不变性分析SAM的范数动态，提出Norm Deviation概念和DAS方法，实验证明DAS优于SAM且计算开销更低。

Motivation: 探索SAM在更一般的张量化和尺度不变模型中的行为，填补研究空白。

Method: 利用尺度不变性分析SAM的范数动态，提出Norm Deviation概念和DAS方法。

Result: DAS在多个任务中表现优于SAM，且计算开销更低。

Conclusion: DAS方法有效模拟SAM的隐式正则化行为，性能更优且高效。

Abstract: Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) has been proven to be an effective
optimization technique for improving generalization in overparameterized
models. While prior works have explored the implicit regularization of SAM in
simple two-core scale-invariant settings, its behavior in more general
tensorized or scale-invariant models remains underexplored. In this work, we
leverage scale-invariance to analyze the norm dynamics of SAM in general
tensorized models. We introduce the notion of \emph{Norm Deviation} as a global
measure of core norm imbalance, and derive its evolution under SAM using
gradient flow analysis. We show that SAM's implicit control of Norm Deviation
is governed by the covariance between core norms and their gradient magnitudes.
Motivated by these findings, we propose a simple yet effective method,
\emph{Deviation-Aware Scaling (DAS)}, which explicitly mimics this
regularization behavior by scaling core norms in a data-adaptive manner. Our
experiments across tensor completion, noisy training, model compression, and
parameter-efficient fine-tuning confirm that DAS achieves competitive or
improved performance over SAM, while offering reduced computational overhead.

TL;DR: RealAC是一个领域无关的框架，用于生成现实且可操作的反事实解释，通过自动保持特征间的复杂依赖关系，并允许用户冻结不希望更改的属性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常依赖手工约束或领域知识，限制了其通用性和捕捉数据中复杂非线性关系的能力，且难以满足用户特定需求。

Method: RealAC通过对齐事实和反事实实例的特征对的联合分布，自动保持特征间依赖关系，并支持用户冻结特定属性。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上，RealAC在因果边分数、依赖保持分数和IM1现实性指标上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: RealAC提供了一种因果感知和用户中心的反事实生成解决方案，平衡了现实性和可操作性。

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations provide human-understandable reasoning for
AI-made decisions by describing minimal changes to input features that would
alter a model's prediction. To be truly useful in practice, such explanations
must be realistic and feasible -- they should respect both the underlying data
distribution and user-defined feasibility constraints. Existing approaches
often enforce inter-feature dependencies through rigid, hand-crafted
constraints or domain-specific knowledge, which limits their generalizability
and ability to capture complex, nonlinear relations inherent in data. Moreover,
they rarely accommodate user-specified preferences and suggest explanations
that are causally implausible or infeasible to act upon. We introduce RealAC, a
domain-agnostic framework for generating realistic and actionable
counterfactuals. RealAC automatically preserves complex inter-feature
dependencies without relying on explicit domain knowledge -- by aligning the
joint distributions of feature pairs between factual and counterfactual
instances. The framework also allows end-users to ``freeze'' attributes they
cannot or do not wish to change by suppressing change in frozen features during
optimization. Evaluations on three synthetic and two real datasets demonstrate
that RealAC balances realism with actionability. Our method outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines and Large Language Model-based counterfactual
generation techniques in causal edge score, dependency preservation score, and
IM1 realism metric and offers a solution for causality-aware and user-centric
counterfactual generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNN在医学图像分类中表现出色，但其决策过程不透明，限制了在高风险临床应用中的可信度。现有解释方法多为事后全局分析，无法提供节点级别的解释。

Method: X-Node为每个节点构建结构化上下文向量，包含可解释的局部拓扑特征，并通过轻量级Reasoner模块生成解释向量，用于重构嵌入、生成自然语言解释并反馈到消息传递中。

Result: 在MedMNIST和MorphoMNIST数据集上，X-Node保持了分类准确性，同时为每个节点提供了忠实且可解释的解释。

Conclusion: X-Node通过自解释机制提升了GNN的可信度，适用于需要高透明度的临床决策场景。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art results in
computer vision and medical image classification tasks by capturing structural
dependencies across data instances. However, their decision-making remains
largely opaque, limiting their trustworthiness in high-stakes clinical
applications where interpretability is essential. Existing explainability
techniques for GNNs are typically post-hoc and global, offering limited insight
into individual node decisions or local reasoning. We introduce X-Node, a
self-explaining GNN framework in which each node generates its own explanation
as part of the prediction process. For every node, we construct a structured
context vector encoding interpretable cues such as degree, centrality,
clustering, feature saliency, and label agreement within its local topology. A
lightweight Reasoner module maps this context into a compact explanation
vector, which serves three purposes: (1) reconstructing the node's latent
embedding via a decoder to enforce faithfulness, (2) generating a natural
language explanation using a pre-trained LLM (e.g., Grok or Gemini), and (3)
guiding the GNN itself via a "text-injection" mechanism that feeds explanations
back into the message-passing pipeline. We evaluate X-Node on two graph
datasets derived from MedMNIST and MorphoMNIST, integrating it with GCN, GAT,
and GIN backbones. Our results show that X-Node maintains competitive
classification accuracy while producing faithful, per-node explanations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦图学习（FGL）中非独立同分布数据分布和类别不平衡问题会严重损害模型性能，尤其是少数类别的识别能力。

Method: GraphFedMIG采用分层生成对抗网络，客户端训练本地生成器合成特征表示，并通过互信息引导机制优化生成器参数。

Result: 在四个真实数据集上的实验表明，GraphFedMIG优于其他基线方法。

Conclusion: GraphFedMIG有效解决了FGL中的类别不平衡问题，提升了模型对少数类别的识别能力。

Abstract: Federated graph learning (FGL) enables multiple clients to collaboratively
train powerful graph neural networks without sharing their private,
decentralized graph data. Inherited from generic federated learning, FGL is
critically challenged by statistical heterogeneity, where non-IID data
distributions across clients can severely impair model performance. A
particularly destructive form of this is class imbalance, which causes the
global model to become biased towards majority classes and fail at identifying
rare but critical events. This issue is exacerbated in FGL, as nodes from a
minority class are often surrounded by biased neighborhood information,
hindering the learning of expressive embeddings. To grapple with this
challenge, we propose GraphFedMIG, a novel FGL framework that reframes the
problem as a federated generative data augmentation task. GraphFedMIG employs a
hierarchical generative adversarial network where each client trains a local
generator to synthesize high-fidelity feature representations. To provide
tailored supervision, clients are grouped into clusters, each sharing a
dedicated discriminator. Crucially, the framework designs a mutual
information-guided mechanism to steer the evolution of these client generators.
By calculating each client's unique informational value, this mechanism
corrects the local generator parameters, ensuring that subsequent rounds of
mutual information-guided generation are focused on producing high-value,
minority-class features. We conduct extensive experiments on four real-world
datasets, and the results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed
GraphFedMIG compared with other baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脑机接口因神经信号漂移和用户间差异导致精度下降，频繁校准限制了实际应用。

Method: EDAPT先通过多用户数据训练基线解码器，再通过监督微调持续个性化模型。

Result: 在三个BCI任务的九个数据集中，EDAPT优于静态方法，且运行高效（200毫秒内更新）。

Conclusion: EDAPT为无校准BCI提供了实用路径，降低了部署障碍。

Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) suffer from accuracy degradation as neural
signals drift over time and vary across users, requiring frequent recalibration
that limits practical deployment. We introduce EDAPT, a task- and
model-agnostic framework that eliminates calibration through continual model
adaptation. EDAPT first trains a baseline decoder using data from multiple
users, then continually personalizes this model via supervised finetuning as
the neural patterns evolve during use. We tested EDAPT across nine datasets
covering three BCI tasks, and found that it consistently improved accuracy over
conventional, static methods. These improvements primarily stem from combining
population-level pretraining and online continual finetuning, with unsupervised
domain adaptation providing further gains on some datasets. EDAPT runs
efficiently, updating models within 200 milliseconds on consumer-grade
hardware. Finally, decoding accuracy scales with total data budget rather than
its allocation between subjects and trials. EDAPT provides a practical pathway
toward calibration-free BCIs, reducing a major barrier to BCI deployment.

Conclusion: 论文建议实践者采取措施减少或避免混杂因素，以提高推荐系统的效果。

Abstract: Unobserved confounding arises when an unmeasured feature influences both the
treatment and the outcome, leading to biased causal effect estimates. This
issue undermines observational studies in fields like economics, medicine,
ecology or epidemiology. Recommender systems leveraging fully observed data
seem not to be vulnerable to this problem. However many standard practices in
recommender systems result in observed features being ignored, resulting in
effectively the same problem. This paper will show that numerous common
practices such as feature engineering, A/B testing and modularization can in
fact introduce confounding into recommendation systems and hamper their
performance. Several illustrations of the phenomena are provided, supported by
simulation studies with practical suggestions about how practitioners may
reduce or avoid the affects of confounding in real systems.

Abstract: We introduce an output layer for neural networks that ensures satisfaction of

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合序列嵌入和神经ODE的新方法，用于从任意观测数据构建世界模型，并通过简单摆系统的图像数据验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: JEPAs比基于重构的方法更强大，但如何利用其构建世界模型尚待探索。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 整合序列嵌入与神经ODE，使用损失函数强制收缩嵌入和Lipschitz常数，构建有序的潜在状态空间。

Result: 成功生成了简单摆系统的结构化潜在状态空间模型，仅使用图像数据。

Conclusion: 该方法为开发更通用的控制算法和估计技术提供了新途径，尤其在机器人领域有广泛应用。

Abstract: With the advent of Joint Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPAs), which
appear to be more capable than reconstruction-based methods, this paper
introduces a novel technique for creating world models using continuous-time
dynamic systems from arbitrary observation data. The proposed method integrates
sequence embeddings with neural ordinary differential equations (neural ODEs).
It employs loss functions that enforce contractive embeddings and Lipschitz
constants in state transitions to construct a well-organized latent state
space. The approach's effectiveness is demonstrated through the generation of
structured latent state-space models for a simple pendulum system using only
image data. This opens up a new technique for developing more general control
algorithms and estimation techniques with broad applications in robotics.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种统一的光谱框架，用于分析和量化解释的平滑性与忠实性及其权衡，并揭示了基于替代模型的平滑方法如何扭曲解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ReLU网络在视觉数据中广泛使用，但其梯度解释通常噪声大且难以解释，现有方法（如GradCAM）通过牺牲忠实性来平滑解释。

Method: 引入一种统一的光谱框架，系统分析解释的平滑性和忠实性，并量化ReLU网络对高频信息的贡献。

Result: 理论分析揭示了替代平滑方法如何导致“解释差距”，并通过实验验证了不同设计选择、数据集和消融的影响。

Conclusion: 该框架为解释的平滑性与忠实性提供了原则性分析，揭示了现有方法的局限性，并提出了改进方向。

Abstract: ReLU networks, while prevalent for visual data, have sharp transitions,
sometimes relying on individual pixels for predictions, making vanilla
gradient-based explanations noisy and difficult to interpret. Existing methods,
such as GradCAM, smooth these explanations by producing surrogate models at the
cost of faithfulness. We introduce a unifying spectral framework to
systematically analyze and quantify smoothness, faithfulness, and their
trade-off in explanations. Using this framework, we quantify and regularize the
contribution of ReLU networks to high-frequency information, providing a
principled approach to identifying this trade-off. Our analysis characterizes
how surrogate-based smoothing distorts explanations, leading to an
``explanation gap'' that we formally define and measure for different post-hoc
methods. Finally, we validate our theoretical findings across different design
choices, datasets, and ablations.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于对比学习的自动化编码本学习方法，用于多类分类，优于传统手动或随机生成的编码本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的ECOC方法依赖手动或随机生成的编码本，效率低且可能效果不佳。

Result: 在四个数据集上，所提模型对抗攻击的鲁棒性优于两种基线方法。

Conclusion: 自动化编码本学习方法在多类分类中具有优越性和实用性。

Abstract: Although one-hot encoding is commonly used for multiclass classification, it
is not always the most effective encoding mechanism. Error Correcting Output
Codes (ECOC) address multiclass classification by mapping each class to a
unique codeword used as a label. Traditional ECOC methods rely on manually
designed or randomly generated codebooks, which are labor-intensive and may
yield suboptimal, dataset-agnostic results. This paper introduces three models
for automated codebook learning based on contrastive learning, allowing
codebooks to be learned directly and adaptively from data. Across four
datasets, our proposed models demonstrate superior robustness to adversarial
attacks compared to two baselines. The source is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MAGUS是一个模块化框架，通过解耦的认知和决策阶段统一多模态理解与生成，支持灵活扩展和高性能跨模态转换。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实多模态应用需要任意模态间理解和生成能力，但现有方法缺乏灵活性和扩展性。

Method: MAGUS采用两阶段设计：认知阶段通过多智能体协作完成结构化理解与规划，决策阶段结合LLM推理和扩散模型生成。

Result: 实验表明MAGUS在多个基准测试中优于现有方法，甚至在MME基准上超越GPT-4o。

Conclusion: MAGUS通过模块化和解耦设计，实现了高性能、灵活扩展的多模态统一系统。

Abstract: Real-world multimodal applications often require any-to-any capabilities,
enabling both understanding and generation across modalities including text,
image, audio, and video. However, integrating the strengths of autoregressive
language models (LLMs) for reasoning and diffusion models for high-fidelity
generation remains challenging. Existing approaches rely on rigid pipelines or
tightly coupled architectures, limiting flexibility and scalability. We propose
MAGUS (Multi-Agent Guided Unified Multimodal System), a modular framework that
unifies multimodal understanding and generation via two decoupled phases:
Cognition and Deliberation. MAGUS enables symbolic multi-agent collaboration
within a shared textual workspace. In the Cognition phase, three
role-conditioned multimodal LLM agents - Perceiver, Planner, and Reflector -
engage in collaborative dialogue to perform structured understanding and
planning. The Deliberation phase incorporates a Growth-Aware Search mechanism
that orchestrates LLM-based reasoning and diffusion-based generation in a
mutually reinforcing manner. MAGUS supports plug-and-play extensibility,
scalable any-to-any modality conversion, and semantic alignment - all without
the need for joint training. Experiments across multiple benchmarks, including
image, video, and audio generation, as well as cross-modal instruction
following, demonstrate that MAGUS outperforms strong baselines and
state-of-the-art systems. Notably, on the MME benchmark, MAGUS surpasses the
powerful closed-source model GPT-4o.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于深度强化学习的非平衡非局部蒙特卡洛算法（NMC），用于优化组合优化问题的复杂成本函数，显著提升了在困难基准测试中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MCMC算法在计算相变附近的困难基准测试中表现不佳，无法有效解冻刚性变量或逃离次优吸引盆地。

Method: 利用深度强化学习训练NMC的非局部转移策略，通过观察能量变化和局部最小能量景观几何来优化探索。

Result: 训练后的策略在均匀随机和尺度自由随机4-SAT基准测试中，在剩余能量、求解时间和解多样性方面优于传统MCMC和非局部模拟退火。

Conclusion: 深度强化学习可以显著提升NMC算法的性能，为组合优化问题提供更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Optimizing or sampling complex cost functions of combinatorial optimization
problems is a longstanding challenge across disciplines and applications. When
employing family of conventional algorithms based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) such as simulated annealing or parallel tempering, one assumes
homogeneous (equilibrium) temperature profiles across input. This instance
independent approach was shown to be ineffective for the hardest benchmarks
near a computational phase transition when the so-called overlap-gap-property
holds. In these regimes conventional MCMC struggles to unfreeze rigid
variables, escape suboptimal basins of attraction, and sample high-quality and
diverse solutions. In order to mitigate these challenges, Nonequilibrium
Nonlocal Monte Carlo (NMC) algorithms were proposed that leverage inhomogeneous
temperature profiles thereby accelerating exploration of the configuration
space without compromising its exploitation. Here, we employ deep reinforcement
learning (RL) to train the nonlocal transition policies of NMC which were
previously designed phenomenologically. We demonstrate that the resulting
solver can be trained solely by observing energy changes of the configuration
space exploration as RL rewards and the local minimum energy landscape geometry
as RL states. We further show that the trained policies improve upon the
standard MCMC-based and nonlocal simulated annealing on hard uniform random and
scale-free random 4-SAT benchmarks in terms of residual energy,
time-to-solution, and diversity of solutions metrics.

Motivation: 解决在无需重新训练的情况下，从多个预训练扩散模型生成联合相关样本并满足任务特定约束的挑战。

Method: 引入耦合指导项以协调扩散模型，并在每个扩散步骤中加入投影步骤以强制执行硬约束。

Result: 在图像对生成、物体操纵和多机器人运动规划等应用中，PCD表现出更好的耦合效果和约束满足能力，且计算成本较低。

Conclusion: PCD是一种高效且有效的方法，能够在无需重新训练的情况下实现联合生成和约束满足。

Abstract: Modifications to test-time sampling have emerged as an important extension to
diffusion algorithms, with the goal of biasing the generative process to
achieve a given objective without having to retrain the entire diffusion model.
However, generating jointly correlated samples from multiple pre-trained
diffusion models while simultaneously enforcing task-specific constraints
without costly retraining has remained challenging. To this end, we propose
Projected Coupled Diffusion (PCD), a novel test-time framework for constrained
joint generation. PCD introduces a coupled guidance term into the generative
dynamics to encourage coordination between diffusion models and incorporates a
projection step at each diffusion step to enforce hard constraints.
Empirically, we demonstrate the effectiveness of PCD in application scenarios
of image-pair generation, object manipulation, and multi-robot motion planning.
Our results show improved coupling effects and guaranteed constraint
satisfaction without incurring excessive computational costs.

Motivation: 过敏原蛋白对公共健康构成挑战，需要更准确的识别方法。

Method: 利用1000亿参数的xTrimoPGLM模型构建Applm框架，进行过敏原蛋白预测。

Result: Appl在识别新过敏原、区分同源蛋白中的过敏原及评估突变功能方面表现优异。

Conclusion: xTrimoPGLM模型对Appl性能至关重要，开源框架和数据集将促进未来研究。

Abstract: Allergens, typically proteins capable of triggering adverse immune responses,
represent a significant public health challenge. To accurately identify
allergen proteins, we introduce Applm (Allergen Prediction with Protein
Language Models), a computational framework that leverages the 100-billion
parameter xTrimoPGLM protein language model. We show that Applm consistently
outperforms seven state-of-the-art methods in a diverse set of tasks that
closely resemble difficult real-world scenarios. These include identifying
novel allergens that lack similar examples in the training set, differentiating
between allergens and non-allergens among homologs with high sequence
similarity, and assessing functional consequences of mutations that create few
changes to the protein sequences. Our analysis confirms that xTrimoPGLM,
originally trained on one trillion tokens to capture general protein sequence
characteristics, is crucial for Applm's performance by detecting important
differences among protein sequences. In addition to providing Applm as
open-source software, we also provide our carefully curated benchmark datasets
to facilitate future research.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种针对软件工程任务的强化学习框架（SWE-oriented RL Framework）和门控奖励累积方法（G-RA），解决了长期任务中奖励稀疏和奖励偏差的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长期强化学习任务中奖励稀疏和奖励偏差问题导致策略优化不稳定，现有方法难以平衡即时奖励与长期目标。

Method: 提出了SWE-oriented RL Framework和G-RA方法，通过门控机制累积即时奖励，确保奖励与长期目标一致。

Result: 实验显示G-RA显著提高了任务完成率（47.6%→93.8%）和修改率（19.6%→23.8%），避免了策略退化。

Conclusion: G-RA为长期强化学习任务提供了平衡奖励累积的实用解决方案，验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Reward sparsity in long-horizon reinforcement learning (RL) tasks remains a
significant challenge, while existing outcome-based reward shaping struggles to
define meaningful immediate rewards without introducing bias or requiring
explicit task decomposition. Alternatively, verification-based reward shaping
uses stepwise critics, but misalignment between immediate rewards and long-term
objectives can lead to reward hacking and suboptimal policies. In this work, we
address this problem in the context of software engineering (SWE) tasks, where
multi-turn reasoning and rule-based verification are critical. We introduce the
SWE-oriented RL Framework, a unified system supporting multi-turn interaction,
docker-based execution, and customizable reward functions. Additionally, we
propose Gated Reward Accumulation (G-RA), a novel method that accumulates
immediate rewards only when high-level (long-term) rewards meet a predefined
threshold, ensuring stable RL optimization. Experiments on SWE-bench Verified
and kBench demonstrate that G-RA leads to an increase in completion rates
(47.6\% \rightarrow 93.8\% and 22.0\% \rightarrow 86.0\%) and modification
rates (19.6\% \rightarrow 23.8\% and 12.0\% \rightarrow 42.0\%), while avoiding
policy degradation caused by reward misalignment. Our findings highlight the
importance of balanced reward accumulation in long-horizon RL and provide a
practical solution.

Abstract: Estimating treatment effects (TE) from observational data is a critical yet
complex task in many fields, from healthcare and economics to public policy.
While recent advances in machine learning and causal inference have produced
powerful estimation techniques, their adoption remains limited due to the need
for deep expertise in causal assumptions, adjustment strategies, and model
selection. In this paper, we introduce CATE-B, an open-source co-pilot system
that uses large language models (LLMs) within an agentic framework to guide
users through the end-to-end process of treatment effect estimation. CATE-B
assists in (i) constructing a structural causal model via causal discovery and
LLM-based edge orientation, (ii) identifying robust adjustment sets through a
novel Minimal Uncertainty Adjustment Set criterion, and (iii) selecting
appropriate regression methods tailored to the causal structure and dataset
characteristics. To encourage reproducibility and evaluation, we release a
suite of benchmark tasks spanning diverse domains and causal complexities. By
combining causal inference with intelligent, interactive assistance, CATE-B
lowers the barrier to rigorous causal analysis and lays the foundation for a
new class of benchmarks in automated treatment effect estimation.

Conclusion: 统一学习方法通过共享图学习空间和uGNN优化，有效提升了异构模型的泛化能力和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Deep learning models often struggle to maintain generalizability in medical
imaging, particularly under domain-fracture scenarios where distribution shifts
arise from varying imaging techniques, acquisition protocols, patient
populations, demographics, and equipment. In practice, each hospital may need
to train distinct models - differing in learning task, width, and depth - to
match local data. For example, one hospital may use Euclidean architectures
such as MLPs and CNNs for tabular or grid-like image data, while another may
require non-Euclidean architectures such as graph neural networks (GNNs) for
irregular data like brain connectomes. How to train such heterogeneous models
coherently across datasets, while enhancing each model's generalizability,
remains an open problem. We propose unified learning, a new paradigm that
encodes each model into a graph representation, enabling unification in a
shared graph learning space. A GNN then guides optimization of these unified
models. By decoupling parameters of individual models and controlling them
through a unified GNN (uGNN), our method supports parameter sharing and
knowledge transfer across varying architectures (MLPs, CNNs, GNNs) and
distributions, improving generalizability. Evaluations on MorphoMNIST and two
MedMNIST benchmarks - PneumoniaMNIST and BreastMNIST - show that unified
learning boosts performance when models are trained on unique distributions and
tested on mixed ones, demonstrating strong robustness to unseen data with large
distribution shifts. Code and benchmarks: https://github.com/basiralab/uGNN

Conclusion: GATs方法有效解决了上采样问题，为能源系统模型提供了更高效的时间序列处理方案。

Abstract: To bridge the temporal granularity gap in energy network design and operation
based on Energy System Models, resampling of time series is required. While
conventional upsampling methods are computationally efficient, they often
result in significant information loss or increased noise. Advanced models such
as time series generation models, Super-Resolution models and imputation models
show potential, but also face fundamental challenges. The goal of time series
generative models is to learn the distribution of the original data to generate
high-resolution series with similar statistical characteristics. This is not
entirely consistent with the definition of upsampling. Time series
Super-Resolution models or imputation models can degrade the accuracy of
upsampling because the input low-resolution time series are sparse and may have
insufficient context. Moreover, such models usually rely on supervised learning
paradigms. This presents a fundamental application paradox: their training
requires the high-resolution time series that is intrinsically absent in
upsampling application scenarios. To address the mentioned upsampling issue,
this paper introduces a new method utilizing Generative Adversarial
Transformers (GATs), which can be trained without access to any ground-truth
high-resolution data. Compared with conventional interpolation methods, the
introduced method can reduce the root mean square error (RMSE) of upsampling
tasks by 9%, and the accuracy of a model predictive control (MPC) application
scenario is improved by 13%.

Conclusion: FreeGAD无需训练即可高效检测异常，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Graph Anomaly Detection (GAD) aims to identify nodes that deviate from the
majority within a graph, playing a crucial role in applications such as social
networks and e-commerce. Despite the current advancements in deep
learning-based GAD, existing approaches often suffer from high deployment costs
and poor scalability due to their complex and resource-intensive training
processes. Surprisingly, our empirical findings suggest that the training phase
of deep GAD methods, commonly perceived as crucial, may actually contribute
less to anomaly detection performance than expected. Inspired by this, we
propose FreeGAD, a novel training-free yet effective GAD method. Specifically,
it leverages an affinity-gated residual encoder to generate anomaly-aware
representations. Meanwhile, FreeGAD identifies anchor nodes as pseudo-normal
and anomalous guides, followed by calculating anomaly scores through
anchor-guided statistical deviations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
FreeGAD achieves superior anomaly detection performance, efficiency, and
scalability on multiple benchmark datasets from diverse domains, without any
training or iterative optimization.

Abstract: Understanding the behavior of deep networks is crucial to increase our
confidence in their results. Despite an extensive body of work for explaining
their predictions, researchers have faced reliability issues, which can be
attributed to insufficient formalism. In our research, we adopt novel
probabilistic and spectral perspectives to formally analyze explanation
methods. Our study reveals a pervasive spectral bias stemming from the use of
gradient, and sheds light on some common design choices that have been
discovered experimentally, in particular, the use of squared gradient and input
perturbation. We further characterize how the choice of perturbation
hyperparameters in explanation methods, such as SmoothGrad, can lead to
inconsistent explanations and introduce two remedies based on our proposed
formalism: (i) a mechanism to determine a standard perturbation scale, and (ii)
an aggregation method which we call SpectralLens. Finally, we substantiate our
theoretical results through quantitative evaluations.

Conclusion: 通过方差缩减技术，本文提出的方法有效解决了MORL中策略梯度方法的样本效率问题，为复杂决策场景提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning (MORL) is a generalization of
traditional Reinforcement Learning (RL) that aims to optimize multiple, often
conflicting objectives simultaneously rather than focusing on a single reward.
This approach is crucial in complex decision-making scenarios where agents must
balance trade-offs between various goals, such as maximizing performance while
minimizing costs. We consider the problem of MORL where the objectives are
combined using a non-linear scalarization function. Just like in standard RL,
policy gradient methods (PGMs) are amongst the most effective for handling
large and continuous state-action spaces in MORL. However, existing PGMs for
MORL suffer from high sample inefficiency, requiring large amounts of data to
be effective. Previous attempts to solve this problem rely on overly strict
assumptions, losing PGMs' benefits in scalability to large state-action spaces.
In this work, we address the issue of sample efficiency by implementing
variance-reduction techniques to reduce the sample complexity of policy
gradients while maintaining general assumptions.

Motivation: 传统的数据划分方法往往忽略每个实例的内在质量，因此需要更稳健的验证方法。

Method: 利用IRT参数对数据集进行划分，并在四个表格数据集上评估其对多种ML模型性能的影响。

Result: IRT揭示了数据实例的异质性，并帮助创建平衡的划分，优化了模型的偏差-方差权衡。高猜测参数的实例会显著降低模型性能。

Conclusion: IRT为数据划分提供了新的视角，能够显著提升模型验证的稳健性和性能。

Abstract: Robust validation of Machine Learning (ML) models is essential, but
traditional data partitioning approaches often ignore the intrinsic quality of
each instance. This study proposes the use of Item Response Theory (IRT)
parameters to characterize and guide the partitioning of datasets in the model
validation stage. The impact of IRT-informed partitioning strategies on the
performance of several ML models in four tabular datasets was evaluated. The
results obtained demonstrate that IRT reveals an inherent heterogeneity of the
instances and highlights the existence of informative subgroups of instances
within the same dataset. Based on IRT, balanced partitions were created that
consistently help to better understand the tradeoff between bias and variance
of the models. In addition, the guessing parameter proved to be a determining
factor: training with high-guessing instances can significantly impair model
performance and resulted in cases with accuracy below 50%, while other
partitions reached more than 70% in the same dataset.

Abstract: Predicting changes in binding free energy ($\Delta\Delta G$) is a vital task
in protein engineering and protein-protein interaction (PPI) engineering for
drug discovery. Previous works have observed a high correlation between
$\Delta\Delta G$ and entropy, using probabilities of biologically important
objects such as side chain angles and residue identities to estimate
$\Delta\Delta G$. However, estimating the full conformational distribution of a
protein complex is generally considered intractable. In this work, we propose a
new approach to $\Delta\Delta G$ prediction that avoids this issue by instead
leveraging energy-based models for estimating the probability of a complex's
conformation. Specifically, we novelly decompose $\Delta\Delta G$ into a
sequence-based component estimated by an inverse folding model and a
structure-based component estimated by an energy model. This decomposition is
made tractable by assuming equilibrium between the bound and unbound states,
allowing us to simplify the estimation of degeneracies associated with each
state. Unlike previous deep learning-based methods, our method incorporates an
energy-based physical inductive bias by connecting the often-used sequence
log-odds ratio-based approach to $\Delta\Delta G$ prediction with a new
$\Delta\Delta E$ term grounded in statistical mechanics. We demonstrate
superiority over existing state-of-the-art structure and sequence-based deep
learning methods in $\Delta\Delta G$ prediction and antibody optimization
against SARS-CoV-2.

Result: MCIB模型在不依赖捷径学习的情况下取得了最佳性能。

Conclusion: 改进模态融合策略和消除捷径信号对提升多模态讽刺检测任务至关重要。

Abstract: Multimodal sarcasm detection is a complex task that requires distinguishing
subtle complementary signals across modalities while filtering out irrelevant
information. Many advanced methods rely on learning shortcuts from datasets
rather than extracting intended sarcasm-related features. However, our
experiments show that shortcut learning impairs the model's generalization in
real-world scenarios. Furthermore, we reveal the weaknesses of current modality
fusion strategies for multimodal sarcasm detection through systematic
experiments, highlighting the necessity of focusing on effective modality
fusion for complex emotion recognition. To address these challenges, we
construct MUStARD++$^{R}$ by removing shortcut signals from MUStARD++. Then, a
Multimodal Conditional Information Bottleneck (MCIB) model is introduced to
enable efficient multimodal fusion for sarcasm detection. Experimental results
show that the MCIB achieves the best performance without relying on shortcut
learning.

Motivation: 现有方法在空间转录组聚类中存在拓扑学习不充分和空间邻域信息建模不足的问题，导致聚类性能受限。

Method: SPHENIC结合了持久同调特征和空间约束优化模块（SCDOM），以稳定表示学习和生成高质量空间嵌入。

Conclusion: SPHENIC通过整合拓扑特征和空间邻域优化，显著提升了空间转录组聚类的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: By incorporating spatial location information, spatial-transcriptomics
clustering yields more comprehensive insights into cell subpopulation
identification. Despite recent progress, existing methods have at least two
limitations: (i) topological learning typically considers only representations
of individual cells or their interaction graphs; however, spatial
transcriptomic profiles are often noisy, making these approaches vulnerable to
low-quality topological signals, and (ii) insufficient modeling of spatial
neighborhood information leads to low-quality spatial embeddings. To address
these limitations, we propose SPHENIC, a novel Spatial Persistent Homology
Enhanced Neighborhood Integrative Clustering method. Specifically, SPHENIC
incorporates invariant topological features into the clustering network to
achieve stable representation learning. Additionally, to construct high-quality
spatial embeddings that reflect the true cellular distribution, we design the
Spatial Constraint and Distribution Optimization Module (SCDOM). This module
increases the similarity between a cell's embedding and those of its spatial
neighbors, decreases similarity with non-neighboring cells, and thereby
produces clustering-friendly spatial embeddings. Extensive experiments on 14
benchmark spatial transcriptomic slices demonstrate that SPHENIC achieves
superior performance on the spatial clustering task, outperforming existing
state-of-the-art methods by 3.31%-6.54% over the best alternative.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种利用生成式AI（GenAI）预测土地覆盖变化的新方法，通过将土地覆盖变化预测视为数据合成问题，并基于历史和辅助数据源进行条件生成。实验表明，该方法在预测不透水表面变化方面优于基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 土地覆盖变化对地球系统过程有重要影响，但现有模型在预测土地覆盖变化方面的能力滞后于其他地球系统过程。

Method: 提出了一种基于生成式AI的框架，将土地覆盖变化预测视为数据合成问题，利用扩散模型进行预测，并与无变化基线模型进行比较。

Result: 实验结果表明，在分辨率≥0.7×0.7km²时，扩散模型的平均绝对误差（MAE）低于基线模型，验证了生成模型能够捕捉历史数据中的时空模式。

Conclusion: 生成式AI在土地覆盖变化预测中具有潜力，未来研究将进一步整合地球物理属性和驱动变量以支持不同情景的模拟。

Abstract: Land cover, both present and future, has a significant effect on several
important Earth system processes. For example, impervious surfaces heat up and
speed up surface water runoff and reduce groundwater infiltration, with
concomitant effects on regional hydrology and flood risk. While regional Earth
System models have increasing skill at forecasting hydrologic and atmospheric
processes at high resolution in future climate scenarios, our ability to
forecast land-use and land-cover change (LULC), a critical input to risk and
consequences assessment for these scenarios, has lagged behind. In this paper,
we propose a new paradigm exploiting Generative AI (GenAI) for land cover
change forecasting by framing LULC forecasting as a data synthesis problem
conditioned on historical and auxiliary data-sources. We discuss desirable
properties of generative models that fundament our research premise, and
demonstrate the feasibility of our methodology through experiments on
imperviousness forecasting using historical data covering the entire
conterminous United States. Specifically, we train a diffusion model for
decadal forecasting of imperviousness and compare its performance to a baseline
that assumes no change at all. Evaluation across 12 metropolitan areas for a
year held-out during training indicate that for average resolutions $\geq
0.7\times0.7km^2$ our model yields MAE lower than such a baseline. This finding
corroborates that such a generative model can capture spatiotemporal patterns
from historical data that are significant for projecting future change.
Finally, we discuss future research to incorporate auxiliary information on
physical properties about the Earth, as well as supporting simulation of
different scenarios by means of driver variables.

expressive power. We then test two selected variants on twelve benchmark
datasets that span a range of different domains. The experiments demonstrate
that our approach matches the accuracy of state-of-the-art graph neural
networks and graph kernels while being more time or memory efficient, depending
on the dataset. We also briefly discuss directly extracting interpretable modal

Abstract: We study the problem of learning a neural sampler to generate samples from
discrete state spaces where the target probability mass function
$\pi\propto\mathrm{e}^{-U}$ is known up to a normalizing constant, which is an
important task in fields such as statistical physics, machine learning,
combinatorial optimization, etc. To better address this challenging task when
the state space has a large cardinality and the distribution is multi-modal, we
propose $\textbf{M}$asked $\textbf{D}$iffusion $\textbf{N}$eural
$\textbf{S}$ampler ($\textbf{MDNS}$), a novel framework for training discrete
neural samplers by aligning two path measures through a family of learning
objectives, theoretically grounded in the stochastic optimal control of the
continuous-time Markov chains. We validate the efficiency and scalability of
MDNS through extensive experiments on various distributions with distinct
statistical properties, where MDNS learns to accurately sample from the target
distributions despite the extremely high problem dimensions and outperforms
other learning-based baselines by a large margin. A comprehensive study of
ablations and extensions is also provided to demonstrate the efficacy and
potential of the proposed framework.

TL;DR: REFN利用强化学习训练大型语言模型（LLM）自动生成网络过滤器，以应对1天或n天漏洞攻击，解决了现有防御措施的扩展性、兼容性和部署问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防御措施（如主机修补和网络过滤）在扩展性、兼容性和部署过程中存在不足，无法有效应对大规模网络设备中的漏洞威胁。

Method: REFN通过强化学习（RL）驱动在线网络奖励，训练LLM生成网络过滤器，并结合知识蒸馏、语言到网络的转换管道和在线验证机制。

Result: 在22类漏洞攻击测试中，REFN表现出更高的准确性（比替代方案高21.1%）、更快的修补时间（平均3.65小时）和更强的扩展性（支持10K设备）。

Conclusion: REFN为利用LLM快速预防大规模漏洞攻击提供了初步解决方案。

Abstract: The exploitation of 1 day or n day vulnerabilities poses severe threats to
networked devices due to massive deployment scales and delayed patching
(average Mean Time To Patch exceeds 60 days). Existing defenses, including host
based patching and network based filtering, are inadequate due to limited
scalability across diverse devices, compatibility issues especially with
embedded or legacy systems, and error prone deployment process (manual patch
validation). To address these issues, we introduce REFN (Reinforcement Learning
From Network), a novel framework that trains Large Language Models (LLMs) to
autonomously generate network filters to prevent 1 day or n day exploitations.
REFN ensures scalability by uniquely employs Reinforcement Learning (RL) driven
by online network rewards instead of traditional Human Feedback (RLHF). REFN
guarantees compatibility via unified deployment on edge security gateways
(Amazon Eero). REFN provides robustness via online validation using real
network traffic. Crucially, REFN addresses three core challenges in training
LLMs for exploit prevention: 1) expanding current LLMs limited vulnerability
fixing expertise via Agentic RAG based Knowledge Distillation, 2) bridging
current LLMs language to network gaps through an RL From VNF Pipeline that
translates language context (vulnerability description) into network
enforcement, 3) addressing the LLM hallucination and non determinism via the
Online Agentic Validation that penalizes erroneous outputs. Evaluated across 22
families of 1 day or n day exploits, REFN demonstrates effectiveness (21.1
percent higher accuracy than alternatives), efficiency (Mean Time To Patch of
3.65 hours) and scalability (easily scale to 10K devices). REFN serves as an
initial step toward training LLMs to rapidly prevent massive scale 1 day or n
day exploitations.

Motivation: 解决电磁仿真中机器学习训练样本生成的高计算复杂度问题。

Method: 利用GPU加速开源电磁仿真软件（gprMax）生成大量天线仿真数据集。

Result: GPU显著优于CPU，开源软件在足够精细的分辨率下与商业软件结果相近。

Conclusion: GPU和开源软件为机器学习天线设计提供了高效且经济的解决方案。

Abstract: This study proposes an antenna simulation framework powered by graphics
processing units (GPUs) based on an open-source electromagnetic (EM) simulation
software (gprMax) for machine learning applications of antenna design and
optimization. Furthermore, it compares the simulation results with those
obtained through commercial EM software. The proposed software framework for
machine learning and surrogate model applications will produce antenna data
sets consisting of a large number of antenna simulation results using GPUs.
Although machine learning methods can attain the optimum solutions for many
problems, they are known to be data-hungry and require a great deal of samples
for the training stage of the algorithms. However, producing a sufficient
number of training samples in EM applications within a limited time is
challenging due to the high computational complexity of EM simulations.
Therefore, GPUs are utilized in this study to simulate a large number of
antennas with predefined or random antenna shape parameters to produce data
sets. Moreover, this study also compares various machine learning and deep
learning models in terms of antenna parameter estimation performance. This
study demonstrates that an entry-level GPU substantially outperforms a high-end
CPU in terms of computational performance, while a high-end gaming GPU can
achieve around 18 times more computational performance compared to a high-end
CPU. Moreover, it is shown that the open-source EM simulation software can
deliver similar results to those obtained via commercial software in the
simulation of microstrip antennas when the spatial resolution of the
simulations is sufficiently fine.

Result: APFL在多个数据集上表现优于现有方法，准确率提升1.10%-15.45%。

Conclusion: APFL通过异构不变性设计，有效解决了非IID数据下的PFL挑战，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) has presented a significant challenge
to deliver personalized models to individual clients through collaborative
training. Existing PFL methods are often vulnerable to non-IID data, which
severely hinders collective generalization and then compromises the subsequent
personalization efforts. In this paper, to address this non-IID issue in PFL,
we propose an Analytic Personalized Federated Learning (APFL) approach via
dual-stream least squares. In our APFL, we use a foundation model as a frozen
backbone for feature extraction. Subsequent to the feature extractor, we
develop dual-stream analytic models to achieve both collective generalization
and individual personalization. Specifically, our APFL incorporates a shared
primary stream for global generalization across all clients, and a dedicated
refinement stream for local personalization of each individual client. The
analytical solutions of our APFL enable its ideal property of heterogeneity
invariance, theoretically meaning that each personalized model remains
identical regardless of how heterogeneous the data are distributed across all
other clients. Empirical results across various datasets also validate the
superiority of our APFL over state-of-the-art baselines, with advantages of at
least 1.10%-15.45% in accuracy.

Motivation: 传统RLVR方法使用Pass@1作为奖励，容易导致策略保守并陷入局部最优。Pass@k作为奖励的潜力及其对探索能力的影响尚未充分研究。

Method: 采用Pass@k作为奖励训练策略模型（Pass@k Training），并通过理论分析推导其优势函数。

Result: 研究发现Pass@k训练能提升探索能力，且探索与利用并非对立目标，而是可以相互促进。

Conclusion: Pass@k训练为RLVR提供了一种高效方法，并启发了优势函数设计的未来研究方向。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), which typically adopts
Pass@1 as the reward, has faced the issues in balancing exploration and
exploitation, causing policies to prefer conservative actions, converging to a
local optimum. Identifying an appropriate reward metric is therefore crucial.
Regarding the prior work, although Pass@k has been used in evaluation, its
connection to LLM exploration ability in RLVR remains largely overlooked. To
investigate this, we first use Pass@k as the reward to train the policy model
(i.e., $\textbf{Pass@k Training}$), and observe the improvement on its
exploration ability. Next, we derive an analytical solution for the advantage
of Pass@k Training, leading to an efficient and effective process. Building on
this, our analysis reveals that exploration and exploitation are not inherently
conflicting objectives, while they can mutually enhance each other. Moreover,
Pass@k Training with analytical derivation essentially involves directly
designing the advantage function. Inspired by this, we preliminarily explore
the advantage design for RLVR, showing promising results and highlighting a
potential future direction.

Method: 使用PAC-Bayesian信息瓶颈理论量化样本信息密度，结合Scaffold Hopping任务提升模型能力，保留TargetDiff架构并通过L-BFGS优化细化构象。

Result: 零样本对接成功率从53%提升至64%，Vina评分从-7.41 kcal/mol提升至-8.07 kcal/mol，QED提升25%，并显著降低外推误差。

Conclusion: IBEX在数据稀缺条件下显著提升了药物设计的性能，具有更高的有效容量和迁移能力。

Abstract: Three-dimensional generative models increasingly drive structure-based drug
discovery, yet it remains constrained by the scarce publicly available
protein-ligand complexes. Under such data scarcity, almost all existing
pipelines struggle to learn transferable geometric priors and consequently
overfit to training-set biases. As such, we present IBEX, an
Information-Bottleneck-EXplored coarse-to-fine pipeline to tackle the chronic
shortage of protein-ligand complex data in structure-based drug design.
Specifically, we use PAC-Bayesian information-bottleneck theory to quantify the
information density of each sample. This analysis reveals how different masking
strategies affect generalization and indicates that, compared with conventional
de novo generation, the constrained Scaffold Hopping task endows the model with
greater effective capacity and improved transfer performance. IBEX retains the
original TargetDiff architecture and hyperparameters for training to generate
molecules compatible with the binding pocket; it then applies an L-BFGS
optimization step to finely refine each conformation by optimizing five
physics-based terms and adjusting six translational and rotational degrees of
freedom in under one second. With only these modifications, IBEX raises the
zero-shot docking success rate on CBGBench CrossDocked2020-based from 53% to
64%, improves the mean Vina score from $-7.41 kcal mol^{-1}$ to $-8.07 kcal
mol^{-1}$, and achieves the best median Vina energy in 57 of 100 pockets versus
3 for the original TargetDiff. IBEX also increases the QED by 25%, achieves
state-of-the-art validity and diversity, and markedly reduces extrapolation
error.

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验表明，DECAF-GAD在保持异常检测性能的同时显著提升了公平性指标。

Conclusion: DECAF-GAD有效解决了GAD中的公平性问题，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Graph anomaly detection (GAD) has become an increasingly important task
across various domains. With the rapid development of graph neural networks
(GNNs), GAD methods have achieved significant performance improvements.
However, fairness considerations in GAD remain largely underexplored. Indeed,
GNN-based GAD models can inherit and amplify biases present in training data,
potentially leading to unfair outcomes. While existing efforts have focused on
developing fair GNNs, most approaches target node classification tasks, where
models often rely on simple layer architectures rather than autoencoder-based
structures, which are the most widely used architecturs for anomaly detection.
To address fairness in autoencoder-based GAD models, we propose
\textbf{D}is\textbf{E}ntangled \textbf{C}ounterfactual \textbf{A}dversarial
\textbf{F}air (DECAF)-GAD, a framework that alleviates bias while preserving
GAD performance. Specifically, we introduce a structural causal model (SCM) to
disentangle sensitive attributes from learned representations. Based on this
causal framework, we formulate a specialized autoencoder architecture along
with a fairness-guided loss function. Through extensive experiments on both
synthetic and real-world datasets, we demonstrate that DECAF-GAD not only
achieves competitive anomaly detection performance but also significantly
enhances fairness metrics compared to baseline GAD methods. Our code is

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Online restless multi-armed bandits (RMABs) typically assume that each arm
follows a stationary Markov Decision Process (MDP) with fixed state transitions
and rewards. However, in real-world applications like healthcare and
recommendation systems, these assumptions often break due to non-stationary
dynamics, posing significant challenges for traditional RMAB algorithms. In
this work, we specifically consider $N$-armd RMAB with non-stationary
transition constrained by bounded variation budgets $B$. Our proposed \rmab\;
algorithm integrates sliding window reinforcement learning (RL) with an upper
confidence bound (UCB) mechanism to simultaneously learn transition dynamics
and their variations. We further establish that \rmab\; achieves
$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(N^2 B^{\frac{1}{4}} T^{\frac{3}{4}})$ regret bound by
leveraging a relaxed definition of regret, providing a foundational theoretical
framework for non-stationary RMAB problems for the first time.

Conclusion: 研究为在线GP算法的数据点缩减标准选择提供了理论和实践指导。

Abstract: Gaussian Processes (GPs) are widely used for regression and system
identification due to their flexibility and ability to quantify uncertainty.
However, their computational complexity limits their applicability to small
datasets. Moreover in a streaming scenario, more and more datapoints accumulate
which is intractable even for Sparse GPs. Online GPs aim to alleviate this
problem by e.g. defining a maximum budget of datapoints and removing redundant
datapoints. This work provides a unified comparison of several reduction
criteria, analyzing both their computational complexity and reduction behavior.
The criteria are evaluated on benchmark functions and real-world datasets,
including dynamic system identification tasks. Additionally, acceptance
criteria are proposed to further filter out redundant datapoints. This work
yields practical guidelines for choosing a suitable criterion for an online GP
algorithm.

Abstract: Memory is fundamental to intelligence, enabling learning, reasoning, and
adaptability across biological and artificial systems. While Transformer
architectures excel at sequence modeling, they face critical limitations in
long-range context retention, continual learning, and knowledge integration.
This review presents a unified framework bridging neuroscience principles,
including dynamic multi-timescale memory, selective attention, and
consolidation, with engineering advances in Memory-Augmented Transformers. We
organize recent progress through three taxonomic dimensions: functional
objectives (context extension, reasoning, knowledge integration, adaptation),
memory representations (parameter-encoded, state-based, explicit, hybrid), and
integration mechanisms (attention fusion, gated control, associative
retrieval). Our analysis of core memory operations (reading, writing,
forgetting, and capacity management) reveals a shift from static caches toward
adaptive, test-time learning systems. We identify persistent challenges in
scalability and interference, alongside emerging solutions including
hierarchical buffering and surprise-gated updates. This synthesis provides a
roadmap toward cognitively-inspired, lifelong-learning Transformer
architectures.

Abstract: Data minimization (DM) describes the principle of collecting only the data
strictly necessary for a given task. It is a foundational principle across
major data protection regulations like GDPR and CPRA. Violations of this
principle have substantial real-world consequences, with regulatory actions
resulting in fines reaching hundreds of millions of dollars. Notably, the
relevance of data minimization is particularly pronounced in machine learning
(ML) applications, which typically rely on large datasets, resulting in an
emerging research area known as Data Minimization in Machine Learning (DMML).
At the same time, existing work on other ML privacy and security topics often
addresses concerns relevant to DMML without explicitly acknowledging the
connection. This disconnect leads to confusion among practitioners,
complicating their efforts to implement DM principles and interpret the
terminology, metrics, and evaluation criteria used across different research
communities. To address this gap, our work introduces a comprehensive framework
for DMML, including a unified data pipeline, adversaries, and points of
minimization. This framework allows us to systematically review the literature
on data minimization and \emph{DM-adjacent} methodologies, for the first time
presenting a structured overview designed to help practitioners and researchers
effectively apply DM principles. Our work facilitates a unified DM-centric
understanding and broader adoption of data minimization strategies in AI/ML.

Abstract: Data attribution methods aim to answer useful counterfactual questions like
"what would a ML model's prediction be if it were trained on a different
dataset?" However, estimation of data attribution models through techniques
like empirical influence or "datamodeling" remains very computationally
expensive. This causes a critical trust issue: if only a few computationally
rich parties can obtain data attributions, how can resource-constrained parties
trust that the provided attributions are indeed "good," especially when they
are used for important downstream applications (e.g., data pricing)? In this
paper, we address this trust issue by proposing an interactive verification
paradigm for data attribution. An untrusted and computationally powerful Prover
learns data attributions, and then engages in an interactive proof with a
resource-constrained Verifier. Our main result is a protocol that provides
formal completeness, soundness, and efficiency guarantees in the sense of
Probably-Approximately-Correct (PAC) verification. Specifically, if both Prover
and Verifier follow the protocol, the Verifier accepts data attributions that
are {\epsilon}-close to the optimal data attributions (in terms of the Mean
Squared Error) with probability 1-{\delta}. Conversely, if the Prover
arbitrarily deviates from the protocol, even with infinite compute, then this
is detected (or it still yields data attributions to the Verifier) except with
probability {\delta}. Importantly, our protocol ensures the Verifier's
workload, measured by the number of independent model retrainings it must
perform, scales only as O(1/{\epsilon}); i.e., independently of the dataset
size. At a technical level, our results apply to efficiently verifying any
linear function over the boolean hypercube computed by the Prover, making them
broadly applicable to various attribution tasks.

Abstract: AI-driven discovery can greatly reduce design time and enhance new
therapeutics' effectiveness. Models using simulators explore broad design
spaces but risk violating implicit constraints due to a lack of experimental
priors. For example, in a new analysis we performed on a diverse set of models
on the GuacaMol benchmark using supervised classifiers, over 60\% of molecules
proposed had high probability of being mutagenic. In this work, we introduce
\ourdataset, a dataset of priors for design problems extracted from literature
describing compounds used in lab settings. It is constructed with LLM pipelines
for discovering therapeutic entities in relevant paragraphs and summarizing
information in concise fair-use facts. \ourdataset~ consists of 32.3 million
pairs of natural language facts, and appropriate entity representations (i.e.
SMILES or refseq IDs). To demonstrate the potential of the data, we train LLM,
CLIP, and LLava architectures to reason jointly about text and design targets
and evaluate on tasks from the Therapeutic Data Commons (TDC). \ourdataset~is
highly effective for creating models with strong priors: in supervised
prediction problems that use our data as pretraining, our best models with 15M
learnable parameters outperform larger 2B TxGemma on both regression and
classification TDC tasks, and perform comparably to 9B models on average.
Models built with \ourdataset~can be used as constraints while optimizing for
novel molecules in GuacaMol, resulting in proposals that are safer and nearly
as effective. We release our dataset at
\href{https://huggingface.co/datasets/medexanon/Medex}{huggingface.co/datasets/medexanon/Medex},
and will provide expanded versions as available literature grows.
