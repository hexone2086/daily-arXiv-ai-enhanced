This\nlimitation becomes particularly apparent in complex terrains. Obstacle\nnegotiation, a critical scenario exemplifying such challenges, requires both\nreal-time perception of obstacle geometry and responsiveness to user intention\nabout when and where to step over or onto, to dynamically adjust swing\ntrajectories. We propose a novel control strategy that fuses environmental\nawareness and human cooperativeness: an on-board depth camera detects obstacles\nahead of swing phase, prompting an elevated early-swing trajectory to ensure\nclearance, while late-swing control defers to natural biomechanical cues from\nthe user. This approach enables intuitive stepping strategies without requiring\nunnatural movement patterns. Experiments with three non-amputee participants\ndemonstrated 100 percent success across more than 150 step-overs and 30\nstep-ons with randomly placed obstacles of varying heights (4-16 cm) and\ndistances (15-70 cm). By effectively addressing obstacle navigation -- a\ngateway challenge for complex terrain mobility -- our system demonstrates\nadaptability to both environmental constraints and user intentions, with\npromising applications across diverse locomotion scenarios."}

However, existing\nmethods still face challenges in coordinating mobile base and manipulator,\nprimarily due to two limitations. On the one hand, they fail to explicitly\nmodel the influence of the mobile base on manipulator control, which easily\nleads to error accumulation under high degrees of freedom. On the other hand,\nthey treat the entire mobile manipulation process with the same visual\nobservation modality (e.g., either all 2D or all 3D), overlooking the distinct\nmultimodal perception requirements at different stages during mobile\nmanipulation. To address this, we propose the Adaptive Coordination Diffusion\nTransformer (AC-DiT), which enhances mobile base and manipulator coordination\nfor end-to-end mobile manipulation. First, since the motion of the mobile base\ndirectly influences the manipulator's actions, we introduce a mobility-to-body\nconditioning mechanism that guides the model to first extract base motion\nrepresentations, which are then used as context prior for predicting whole-body\nactions. This enables whole-body control that accounts for the potential impact\nof the mobile base's motion. Second, to meet the perception requirements at\ndifferent stages of mobile manipulation, we design a perception-aware\nmultimodal conditioning strategy that dynamically adjusts the fusion weights\nbetween various 2D visual images and 3D point clouds, yielding visual features\ntailored to the current perceptual needs. This allows the model to, for\nexample, adaptively rely more on 2D inputs when semantic information is crucial\nfor action prediction, while placing greater emphasis on 3D geometric\ninformation when precise spatial understanding is required. We validate AC-DiT\nthrough extensive experiments on both simulated and real-world mobile\nmanipulation tasks."}

Moreover, a Regional Joint Loss\n(RJLoss) has been created as a new loss to inhibit abnormal categories in the\nsame area. A new evaluation metric called ``AD-Acc.'' is introduced to address\nthe shortcomings of existing methods in addressing negative samples.\nComprehensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance in four metrics across two benchmark datasets.\nSpecifically, our model achieves an improvement of \\textbf{0.7}$\\uparrow$,\n\\textbf{2.0}$\\uparrow$, \\textbf{1.6}$\\uparrow$, and \\textbf{11.0}$\\uparrow$ in\nSC-Acc., mIoU, wIoU, and AD-Acc. metrics, respectively, on the HOT-Annotated\ndataset.

We pretrain transformer models on sample traces from this\ntoy, specifically symbolically-labeled interleaved state observations from\nrandomly drawn linear deterministic dynamical systems. We study if the\ntransformer models can recall the state of a sequence previously seen in its\ncontext when prompted to do so with the corresponding in-context label. Taking\na closer look at this task, it becomes clear that the model must perform two\nfunctions: (1) identify which system's state should be recalled and apply that\nsystem to its last seen state, and (2) continuing to apply the correct system\nto predict the subsequent states. Training dynamics reveal that the first\ncapability emerges well into a model's training. Surprisingly, the second\ncapability, of continuing the prediction of a resumed sequence, develops much\nearlier.\n  Via out-of-distribution experiments, and a mechanistic analysis on model\nweights via edge pruning, we find that next-token prediction for this toy\nproblem involves at least two separate mechanisms. One mechanism uses the\ndiscrete symbolic labels to do the associative recall required to predict the\nstart of a resumption of a previously seen sequence. The second mechanism,\nwhich is largely agnostic to the discrete symbolic labels, performs a\n\"Bayesian-style\" prediction based on the previous token and the context. These\ntwo mechanisms have different learning dynamics.\n  To confirm that this multi-mechanism (manifesting as separate phase\ntransitions) phenomenon is not just an artifact of our toy setting, we used\nOLMo training checkpoints on an ICL translation task to see a similar\nphenomenon: a decisive gap in the emergence of first-task-token performance vs\nsecond-task-token performance."}

From a theoretical\nperspective: (i) we establish permutation and equivalence invariance results,\ndemonstrating that the method produces outputs that are stable under reordering\nof clauses and variables; (ii) we identify a theoretical limitation, showing\nthat for a class of formulae called foldable formulae, standard GNNs cannot\nalways distinguish satisfiable from unsatisfiable instances; (iii) we prove a\nuniversal approximation theorem, establishing that with Random Node\nInitialization (RNI), the method can approximate SAT solving to arbitrary\nprecision on finite datasets, that is, the GNN becomes approximately sound and\ncomplete on such datasets.

Our out-of-core method\neliminates the need to load all images and networks simultaneously, and\noperates on a single device. We achieve this by dividing the region of interest\ninto NeRFs that 3D tile without overlap. Importantly, we crop the images with\noverlap to ensure each NeRFs is trained with all the necessary pixels. We\nintroduce a novel $2\\times 2$ 3D tile progression strategy and segmented\nsampler, which together prevent 3D reconstruction errors along the tile edges.\nOur experiments conclude that large satellite images can effectively be\nprocessed with linear time complexity, on a single GPU, and without compromise\nin quality."}

This constraint prevents\nmodels from fully exploiting sparse regimes, forcing awkward compromises. We\npropose Subpixel Placement of Tokens (SPoT), a novel tokenization strategy that\npositions tokens continuously within images, effectively sidestepping\ngrid-based limitations. With our proposed oracle-guided search, we uncover\nsubstantial performance gains achievable with ideal subpixel token positioning,\ndrastically reducing the number of tokens necessary for accurate predictions\nduring inference. SPoT provides a new direction for flexible, efficient, and\ninterpretable ViT architectures, redefining sparsity as a strategic advantage\nrather than an imposed limitation."}

Evaluating Multimodal Foundation Models on Standard Computer Vision Tasks", "comment": "Project page at https://fm-vision-evals.epfl.ch/", "summary": "Multimodal foundation models, such as GPT-4o, have recently made remarkable\nprogress, but it is not clear where exactly these models stand in terms of\nunderstanding vision. In this paper, we benchmark the performance of popular\nmultimodal foundation models (GPT-4o, o4-mini, Gemini 1.5 Pro and Gemini 2.0\nFlash, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Qwen2-VL, Llama 3.2) on standard computer vision\ntasks (semantic segmentation, object detection, image classification, depth and\nsurface normal prediction) using established datasets (e.g., COCO, ImageNet and\nits variants, etc).\n  The main challenges to performing this are: 1) most models are trained to\noutput text and cannot natively express versatile domains, such as segments or\n3D geometry, and 2) many leading models are proprietary and accessible only at\nan API level, i.e., there is no weight access to adapt them. We address these\nchallenges by translating standard vision tasks into equivalent text-promptable\nand API-compatible tasks via prompt chaining to create a standardized\nbenchmarking framework.\n  We observe that 1) the models are not close to the state-of-the-art\nspecialist models at any task. However, 2) they are respectable generalists;\nthis is remarkable as they are presumably trained on primarily image-text-based\ntasks. 3) They perform semantic tasks notably better than geometric ones. 4)\nWhile the prompt-chaining techniques affect performance, better models exhibit\nless sensitivity to prompt variations. 5) GPT-4o performs the best among\nnon-reasoning models, securing the top position in 4 out of 6 tasks, 6)\nreasoning models, e.g. o3, show improvements in geometric tasks, and 7) a\npreliminary analysis of models with native image generation, like the latest\nGPT-4o, shows they exhibit quirks like hallucinations and spatial\nmisalignments."}
