### [1] [Boosting Adversarial Transferability via Residual Perturbation Attack](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05689)
*Jinjia Peng,Zeze Tao,Huibing Wang,Meng Wang,Yang Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为ResPA的新型攻击方法，利用残差梯度作为扰动方向，提升对抗样本的迁移性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有迁移攻击方法忽略了扰动方向的影响，导致迁移性有限。

Method: 通过指数移动平均获取参考梯度，利用残差梯度捕捉全局扰动方向变化。

Result: 实验表明ResPA的迁移性优于现有方法，结合输入变换方法可进一步提升。

Conclusion: ResPA通过优化扰动方向，显著提升了对抗样本的迁移性。

Abstract: Deep neural networks are susceptible to adversarial examples while suffering
from incorrect predictions via imperceptible perturbations. Transfer-based
attacks create adversarial examples for surrogate models and transfer these
examples to target models under black-box scenarios. Recent studies reveal that
adversarial examples in flat loss landscapes exhibit superior transferability
to alleviate overfitting on surrogate models. However, the prior arts overlook
the influence of perturbation directions, resulting in limited transferability.
In this paper, we propose a novel attack method, named Residual Perturbation
Attack (ResPA), relying on the residual gradient as the perturbation direction
to guide the adversarial examples toward the flat regions of the loss function.
Specifically, ResPA conducts an exponential moving average on the input
gradients to obtain the first moment as the reference gradient, which
encompasses the direction of historical gradients. Instead of heavily relying
on the local flatness that stems from the current gradients as the perturbation
direction, ResPA further considers the residual between the current gradient
and the reference gradient to capture the changes in the global perturbation
direction. The experimental results demonstrate the better transferability of
ResPA than the existing typical transfer-based attack methods, while the
transferability can be further improved by combining ResPA with the current
input transformation methods. The code is available at

### [2] [Generalized Few-Shot Out-of-Distribution Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05732)
*Pinxuan Li,Bing Cao,Changqing Zhang,Qinghua Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为GOOD的框架，通过引入通用知识模型（GKM）和知识动态嵌入（KDE）机制，解决少样本OOD检测中的泛化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有少样本OOD检测方法因训练数据有限导致泛化能力不足，无法适应开放世界。

Method: 提出GOOD框架，引入GKM和KDE机制，动态调整通用知识与特定知识的平衡。

Result: 在真实OOD基准测试中表现优越，理论推导证明了GS平衡的有效性。

Conclusion: GOOD框架通过通用知识模型和动态嵌入机制，显著提升了少样本OOD检测的泛化能力。

Abstract: Few-shot Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection has emerged as a critical
research direction in machine learning for practical deployment. Most existing
Few-shot OOD detection methods suffer from insufficient generalization
capability for the open world. Due to the few-shot learning paradigm, the OOD
detection ability is often overfit to the limited training data itself, thus
degrading the performance on generalized data and performing inconsistently
across different scenarios. To address this challenge, we proposed a
Generalized Few-shot OOD Detection (GOOD) framework, which empowers the general
knowledge of the OOD detection model with an auxiliary General Knowledge Model
(GKM), instead of directly learning from few-shot data. We proceed to reveal
the few-shot OOD detection from a generalization perspective and theoretically
derive the Generality-Specificity balance (GS-balance) for OOD detection, which
provably reduces the upper bound of generalization error with a general
knowledge model. Accordingly, we propose a Knowledge Dynamic Embedding (KDE)
mechanism to adaptively modulate the guidance of general knowledge. KDE
dynamically aligns the output distributions of the OOD detection model to the
general knowledge model based on the Generalized Belief (G-Belief) of GKM,
thereby boosting the GS-balance. Experiments on real-world OOD benchmarks
demonstrate our superiority. Codes will be available.

### [3] [UnGuide: Learning to Forget with LoRA-Guided Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05755)
*Agnieszka Polowczyk,Alicja Polowczyk,Dawid Malarz,Artur Kasymov,Marcin Mazur,Jacek Tabor,Przemysław Spurek*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UnGuide是一种新方法，通过动态推理机制UnGuidance，结合LoRA适配器实现精确的模型遗忘，同时保持图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模文本到图像扩散模型可能被滥用生成有害内容，需要有效的方法在不影响整体性能的情况下移除特定知识。

Method: UnGuide利用Classifier-Free Guidance动态调整指导尺度，结合LoRA适配器选择性遗忘概念。

Result: UnGuide在概念移除任务中表现优于现有方法，同时保持了模型的表达能力。

Conclusion: UnGuide提供了一种高效且精确的模型遗忘方法，解决了LoRA在遗忘过程中影响无关内容的问题。

Abstract: Recent advances in large-scale text-to-image diffusion models have heightened
concerns about their potential misuse, especially in generating harmful or
misleading content. This underscores the urgent need for effective machine
unlearning, i.e., removing specific knowledge or concepts from pretrained
models without compromising overall performance. One possible approach is
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), which offers an efficient means to fine-tune models
for targeted unlearning. However, LoRA often inadvertently alters unrelated
content, leading to diminished image fidelity and realism. To address this
limitation, we introduce UnGuide -- a novel approach which incorporates
UnGuidance, a dynamic inference mechanism that leverages Classifier-Free
Guidance (CFG) to exert precise control over the unlearning process. UnGuide
modulates the guidance scale based on the stability of a few first steps of
denoising processes, enabling selective unlearning by LoRA adapter. For prompts
containing the erased concept, the LoRA module predominates and is
counterbalanced by the base model; for unrelated prompts, the base model
governs generation, preserving content fidelity. Empirical results demonstrate
that UnGuide achieves controlled concept removal and retains the expressive
power of diffusion models, outperforming existing LoRA-based methods in both
object erasure and explicit content removal tasks.

### [4] [Improving Masked Style Transfer using Blended Partial Convolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05769)
*Seyed Hadi Seyed,Ayberk Cansever,David Hart*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于部分卷积的风格迁移网络，专注于对图像中特定区域进行风格迁移，避免了传统方法在区域选择上的缺陷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法对整个图像进行风格迁移后通过掩码处理，但会导致感兴趣区域的风格特征捕捉不准确。

Method: 采用部分卷积网络和内部混合技术，精确地将风格特征应用于感兴趣区域。

Result: 在SA-1B数据集上验证了视觉和量化上的改进。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了区域风格迁移的准确性和视觉效果，代码已开源。

Abstract: Artistic style transfer has long been possible with the advancements of
convolution- and transformer-based neural networks. Most algorithms apply the
artistic style transfer to the whole image, but individual users may only need
to apply a style transfer to a specific region in the image. The standard
practice is to simply mask the image after the stylization. This work shows
that this approach tends to improperly capture the style features in the region
of interest. We propose a partial-convolution-based style transfer network that
accurately applies the style features exclusively to the region of interest.
Additionally, we present network-internal blending techniques that account for
imperfections in the region selection. We show that this visually and
quantitatively improves stylization using examples from the SA-1B dataset. Code
is publicly available at https://github.com/davidmhart/StyleTransferMasked.

### [5] [MAISI-v2: Accelerated 3D High-Resolution Medical Image Synthesis with Rectified Flow and Region-specific Contrastive Loss](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05772)
*Can Zhao,Pengfei Guo,Dong Yang,Yucheng Tang,Yufan He,Benjamin Simon,Mason Belue,Stephanie Harmon,Baris Turkbey,Daguang Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MAISI-v2是一个加速的3D医学图像合成框架，通过整合rectified flow实现快速高质量生成，并引入区域特异性对比损失提升条件一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有扩散模型在医学图像合成中的局限性：泛化性差、推理速度慢、输入条件对齐弱。

Method: 整合rectified flow加速生成，引入区域特异性对比损失增强条件一致性。

Result: MAISI-v2实现了33倍加速的潜在扩散模型，并达到SOTA图像质量，合成图像可用于数据增强。

Conclusion: MAISI-v2在速度和条件一致性上显著改进，为医学图像合成提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Medical image synthesis is an important topic for both clinical and research
applications. Recently, diffusion models have become a leading approach in this
area. Despite their strengths, many existing methods struggle with (1) limited
generalizability that only work for specific body regions or voxel spacings,
(2) slow inference, which is a common issue for diffusion models, and (3) weak
alignment with input conditions, which is a critical issue for medical imaging.
MAISI, a previously proposed framework, addresses generalizability issues but
still suffers from slow inference and limited condition consistency. In this
work, we present MAISI-v2, the first accelerated 3D medical image synthesis
framework that integrates rectified flow to enable fast and high quality
generation. To further enhance condition fidelity, we introduce a novel
region-specific contrastive loss to enhance the sensitivity to region of
interest. Our experiments show that MAISI-v2 can achieve SOTA image quality
with $33 \times$ acceleration for latent diffusion model. We also conducted a
downstream segmentation experiment to show that the synthetic images can be
used for data augmentation. We release our code, training details, model
weights, and a GUI demo to facilitate reproducibility and promote further
development within the community.

### [6] [Few-Shot Deployment of Pretrained MRI Transformers in Brain Imaging Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05783)
*Mengyu Li,Guoyao Shen,Chad W. Farris,Xin Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于预训练MRI变换器的少样本部署框架，结合MAE预训练策略和混合架构，在数据有限条件下实现高效、稳定的医学影像任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决医学影像中标注数据稀缺导致的变换器模型实际应用受限问题。

Method: 采用MAE预训练策略在大规模脑MRI数据集上获取可迁移的潜在表示；针对分类任务使用冻结MAE编码器与轻量级线性头；针对分割任务提出MAE-FUnet混合架构。

Result: 在MRI序列识别任务中达到SOTA准确率；在分割任务中优于其他基线模型。

Conclusion: 该框架高效、稳定且可扩展，适用于低资源临床环境和神经影像应用。

Abstract: Machine learning using transformers has shown great potential in medical
imaging, but its real-world applicability remains limited due to the scarcity
of annotated data. In this study, we propose a practical framework for the
few-shot deployment of pretrained MRI transformers in diverse brain imaging
tasks. By utilizing the Masked Autoencoder (MAE) pretraining strategy on a
large-scale, multi-cohort brain MRI dataset comprising over 31 million slices,
we obtain highly transferable latent representations that generalize well
across tasks and datasets. For high-level tasks such as classification, a
frozen MAE encoder combined with a lightweight linear head achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy in MRI sequence identification with minimal
supervision. For low-level tasks such as segmentation, we propose MAE-FUnet, a
hybrid architecture that fuses multiscale CNN features with pretrained MAE
embeddings. This model consistently outperforms other strong baselines in both
skull stripping and multi-class anatomical segmentation under data-limited
conditions. With extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations, our
framework demonstrates efficiency, stability, and scalability, suggesting its
suitability for low-resource clinical environments and broader neuroimaging
applications.

### [7] [Optimization-Free Style Transfer for 3D Gaussian Splats](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05813)
*Raphael Du Sablon,David Hart*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需重建或优化的3D高斯样条风格迁移方法，通过生成样条隐式表面的图结构，实现快速风格迁移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法需要重建或优化样条或特征提取网络，限制了效率和灵活性。

Method: 生成样条隐式表面的图结构，使用前馈表面风格化方法，并将结果插值回样条。

Result: 支持任意风格图像和3D高斯样条，无需额外训练或优化，速度在2分钟内完成。

Conclusion: 该方法高效灵活，适用于多种风格迁移场景。

Abstract: The task of style transfer for 3D Gaussian splats has been explored in many
previous works, but these require reconstructing or fine-tuning the splat while
incorporating style information or optimizing a feature extraction network on
the splat representation. We propose a reconstruction- and optimization-free
approach to stylizing 3D Gaussian splats. This is done by generating a graph
structure across the implicit surface of the splat representation. A
feed-forward, surface-based stylization method is then used and interpolated
back to the individual splats in the scene. This allows for any style image and
3D Gaussian splat to be used without any additional training or optimization.
This also allows for fast stylization of splats, achieving speeds under 2
minutes even on consumer-grade hardware. We demonstrate the quality results
this approach achieves and compare to other 3D Gaussian splat style transfer
methods. Code is publicly available at
https://github.com/davidmhart/FastSplatStyler.

### [8] [MZEN: Multi-Zoom Enhanced NeRF for 3-D Reconstruction with Unknown Camera Poses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05819)
*Jong-Ik Park,Carlee Joe-Wong,Gary K. Fedder*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MZEN是一种改进的NeRF框架，专为处理多缩放图像集设计，通过引入可学习的缩放标量和新的姿态策略，显著提升了工业检测中的细节捕捉能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有NeRF方法在工业检测中无法捕捉微米级细节，且多缩放图像会破坏多视角一致性，因此需要一种新方法来解决这些问题。

Method: MZEN通过（i）扩展针孔相机模型以包含可学习的缩放标量，（ii）提出一种新的姿态策略，先解决广角图像，再通过缩放一致裁剪匹配处理缩放图像。

Result: 在多个场景中，MZEN显著优于基线方法，PSNR提升28%，SSIM提升10%，LPIPS降低222%。

Conclusion: MZEN成功将NeRF扩展到工业检测领域，既能保持全局精度，又能捕捉微米级细节。

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) methods excel at 3D reconstruction from
multiple 2D images, even those taken with unknown camera poses. However, they
still miss the fine-detailed structures that matter in industrial inspection,
e.g., detecting sub-micron defects on a production line or analyzing chips with
Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). In these scenarios, the sensor resolution
is fixed and compute budgets are tight, so the only way to expose fine
structure is to add zoom-in images; yet, this breaks the multi-view consistency
that pose-free NeRF training relies on. We propose Multi-Zoom Enhanced NeRF
(MZEN), the first NeRF framework that natively handles multi-zoom image sets.
MZEN (i) augments the pin-hole camera model with an explicit, learnable zoom
scalar that scales the focal length, and (ii) introduces a novel pose strategy:
wide-field images are solved first to establish a global metric frame, and
zoom-in images are then pose-primed to the nearest wide-field counterpart via a
zoom-consistent crop-and-match procedure before joint refinement. Across eight
forward-facing scenes$\unicode{x2013}$synthetic TCAD models, real SEM of
micro-structures, and BLEFF objects$\unicode{x2013}$MZEN consistently
outperforms pose-free baselines and even high-resolution variants, boosting
PSNR by up to $28 \%$, SSIM by $10 \%$, and reducing LPIPS by up to $222 \%$.
MZEN, therefore, extends NeRF to real-world factory settings, preserving global
accuracy while capturing the micron-level details essential for industrial
inspection.

### [9] [TSMS-SAM2: Multi-scale Temporal Sampling Augmentation and Memory-Splitting Pruning for Promptable Video Object Segmentation and Tracking in Surgical Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05829)
*Guoping Xu,Hua-Chieh Shao,You Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TSMS-SAM2是一种新型框架，通过多时间尺度视频采样增强和内存分割修剪机制，提升了手术视频中可提示视频对象分割与跟踪的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手术视频分析中，复杂运动动态和内存冗余阻碍了基础模型（如SAM2）的有效学习。

Method: 提出多时间尺度视频采样增强和内存分割修剪机制，以应对快速对象运动和内存冗余。

Result: 在EndoVis2017和EndoVis2018数据集上分别达到95.24和86.73的Dice分数，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TSMS-SAM2在复杂手术场景中展现出高效、鲁棒的分割潜力。

Abstract: Promptable video object segmentation and tracking (VOST) has seen significant
advances with the emergence of foundation models like Segment Anything Model 2
(SAM2); however, their application in surgical video analysis remains
challenging due to complex motion dynamics and the redundancy of memory that
impedes effective learning. In this work, we propose TSMS-SAM2, a novel
framework that enhances promptable VOST in surgical videos by addressing
challenges of rapid object motion and memory redundancy in SAM2. TSMS-SAM2
introduces two key strategies: multi-temporal-scale video sampling augmentation
to improve robustness against motion variability, and a memory splitting and
pruning mechanism that organizes and filters past frame features for more
efficient and accurate segmentation. Evaluated on EndoVis2017 and EndoVis2018
datasets, TSMS-SAM2 achieved the highest mean Dice scores of 95.24 and 86.73,
respectively, outperforming prior SAM-based and task-specific methods.
Extensive ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of multiscale temporal
augmentation and memory splitting, highlighting the framework's potential for
robust, efficient segmentation in complex surgical scenarios. Our source code
will be available at https://github.com/apple1986/TSMS-SAM2.

### [10] [Temporal Cluster Assignment for Efficient Real-Time Video Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05851)
*Ka-Wai Yung,Felix J. S. Bragman,Jialang Xu,Imanol Luengo,Danail Stoyanov,Evangelos B. Mazomenos*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Temporal Cluster Assignment（TCA）的轻量级方法，通过利用帧间的时间一致性优化视频分割中的token聚类，显著减少计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Swin Transformer在视频分割中计算成本高，传统token剪枝方法因窗口注意力机制受限，且现有聚类方法未充分利用时间冗余。

Method: TCA通过时间相关性优化token聚类，避免冗余token的丢弃，保留细节并减少计算。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，TCA显著提升了现有聚类方法的精度与速度平衡。

Conclusion: TCA是一种无需微调的高效方法，适用于自然和特定领域的视频分割。

Abstract: Vision Transformers have substantially advanced the capabilities of
segmentation models across both image and video domains. Among them, the Swin
Transformer stands out for its ability to capture hierarchical, multi-scale
representations, making it a popular backbone for segmentation in videos.
However, despite its window-attention scheme, it still incurs a high
computational cost, especially in larger variants commonly used for dense
prediction in videos. This remains a major bottleneck for real-time,
resource-constrained applications. Whilst token reduction methods have been
proposed to alleviate this, the window-based attention mechanism of Swin
requires a fixed number of tokens per window, limiting the applicability of
conventional pruning techniques. Meanwhile, training-free token clustering
approaches have shown promise in image segmentation while maintaining window
consistency. Nevertheless, they fail to exploit temporal redundancy, missing a
key opportunity to further optimize video segmentation performance. We
introduce Temporal Cluster Assignment (TCA), a lightweight and effective,
fine-tuning-free strategy that enhances token clustering by leveraging temporal
coherence across frames. Instead of indiscriminately dropping redundant tokens,
TCA refines token clusters using temporal correlations, thereby retaining
fine-grained details while significantly reducing computation. Extensive
evaluations on YouTube-VIS 2019, YouTube-VIS 2021, OVIS, and a private surgical
video dataset show that TCA consistently boosts the accuracy-speed trade-off of
existing clustering-based methods. Our results demonstrate that TCA generalizes
competently across both natural and domain-specific videos.

*Kaiser Hamid,Khandakar Ashrafi Akbar,Nade Liang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于视觉-语言框架的驾驶员视觉注意力预测方法，通过自然语言描述注意力变化，并在少量样本或无样本学习下表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多关注静态图像的注意力分配，而忽略了动态变化的注意力行为。本文旨在通过自然语言建模驾驶员的动态注意力变化。

Method: 利用BDD-A数据集的高质量标注，结合人类反馈优化，微调LLaVA模型，整合低层线索和上下文信息，生成基于语言的注意力描述。

Result: 微调后的模型在注意力转移检测和可解释性上优于通用视觉-语言模型，并提出了领域特定的评估指标。

Conclusion: 该方法为自动驾驶中的可解释AI提供了新方向，支持行为预测、人机协作等下游任务。

Abstract: Driver visual attention prediction is a critical task in autonomous driving
and human-computer interaction (HCI) research. Most prior studies focus on
estimating attention allocation at a single moment in time, typically using
static RGB images such as driving scene pictures. In this work, we propose a
vision-language framework that models the changing landscape of drivers' gaze
through natural language, using few-shot and zero-shot learning on single RGB
images. We curate and refine high-quality captions from the BDD-A dataset using
human-in-the-loop feedback, then fine-tune LLaVA to align visual perception
with attention-centric scene understanding. Our approach integrates both
low-level cues and top-down context (e.g., route semantics, risk anticipation),
enabling language-based descriptions of gaze behavior. We evaluate performance
across training regimes (few shot, and one-shot) and introduce domain-specific
metrics for semantic alignment and response diversity. Results show that our
fine-tuned model outperforms general-purpose VLMs in attention shift detection
and interpretability. To our knowledge, this is among the first attempts to
generate driver visual attention allocation and shifting predictions in natural
language, offering a new direction for explainable AI in autonomous driving.
Our approach provides a foundation for downstream tasks such as behavior
forecasting, human-AI teaming, and multi-agent coordination.

### [12] [Multi-view Gaze Target Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05857)
*Qiaomu Miao,Vivek Raju Golani,Jingyi Xu,Progga Paromita Dutta,Minh Hoai,Dimitris Samaras*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种多视角相机方法用于视线目标估计（GTE），通过整合不同视角信息提升准确性，解决单视角方法中的人脸遮挡、目标模糊等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有单视角GTE方法存在人脸遮挡、目标模糊和视野外目标等局限性，多视角方法能显著提升准确性和适用性。

Method: 采用双视角输入，结合头部信息聚合（HIA）、不确定性视线选择（UGS）和极线场景注意力（ESA）模块，实现跨视角信息共享和可靠视线输出。

Result: 方法显著优于单视角基线，尤其在第二视角提供清晰人脸时；还能仅用第二视角图像估计第一视角的视线目标。

Conclusion: 多视角GTE方法有效解决单视角局限，并引入多视角数据集推动相关研究。

Abstract: This paper presents a method that utilizes multiple camera views for the gaze
target estimation (GTE) task. The approach integrates information from
different camera views to improve accuracy and expand applicability, addressing
limitations in existing single-view methods that face challenges such as face
occlusion, target ambiguity, and out-of-view targets. Our method processes a
pair of camera views as input, incorporating a Head Information Aggregation
(HIA) module for leveraging head information from both views for more accurate
gaze estimation, an Uncertainty-based Gaze Selection (UGS) for identifying the
most reliable gaze output, and an Epipolar-based Scene Attention (ESA) module
for cross-view background information sharing. This approach significantly
outperforms single-view baselines, especially when the second camera provides a
clear view of the person's face. Additionally, our method can estimate the gaze
target in the first view using the image of the person in the second view only,
a capability not possessed by single-view GTE methods. Furthermore, the paper
introduces a multi-view dataset for developing and evaluating multi-view GTE
methods. Data and code are available at

### [13] [ETTA: Efficient Test-Time Adaptation for Vision-Language Models through Dynamic Embedding Updates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05898)
*Hamidreza Dastmalchi,Aijun An,Ali cheraghian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ETTA提出了一种高效的测试时适应方法，通过递归更新模块和自适应集成模块，动态优化决策边界和减少提示依赖，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练的视觉语言模型在零样本任务中表现良好，但在分布偏移下泛化能力不足。测试时适应（TTA）通过适应未标记的测试数据来解决这一问题，但现有方法存在局限性。

Method: ETTA引入递归更新模块，动态整合所有测试样本以优化决策边界，并采用自适应集成模块减少提示依赖。

Result: 实验表明，ETTA在计算复杂度和准确性上均优于现有TTA模型。

Conclusion: ETTA为高效的测试时适应设定了新标准，代码已开源。

Abstract: Pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP show strong zero-shot
performance but struggle with generalization under distribution shifts.
Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) addresses this by adapting VLMs to unlabeled test
data in new domains. While some TTA methods rely on prompt-tuning,
training-free cache-based approaches are preferred for efficiency. However,
current cache-based TTA models store only a limited set of high-confidence
samples, restricting the decision boundary to these samples and ignoring the
influence of other incoming test data. To address this, we propose Efficient
Test-Time Adaptation (ETTA), introducing a Recursive Updating module that
integrates all incoming test samples, progressively refining the decision
boundary. This strategy mimics an unbounded cache, dynamically updating
contextual embeddings for improved accuracy with minimal memory and
computational overhead. ETTA also includes an Adaptive Ensemble module to
reduce prompt dependency in image-to-text scores by dynamically selecting
optimal prompts for each class. Furthermore, ETTA adaptively combines scores
from both modules based on confidence levels, leveraging their complementary
strengths. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks confirm that ETTA surpasses
the state-of-the-art TTA models in computational complexity and accuracy,
setting a new standard for effective, efficient test-time adaptation. The code
has been released at https://github.com/hamidreza-dastmalchi/ETTA.

*Zixuan Bian,Ruohan Ren,Yue Yang,Chris Callison-Burch*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HOLODECK 2.0是一个基于视觉语言模型的3D场景生成框架，支持交互式编辑，能生成多样且语义准确的场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前3D场景生成依赖大量人工，且现有自动化方法难以生成开放域场景或支持灵活编辑。

Method: 利用视觉语言模型解析输入描述，生成高质量3D资产，并通过空间约束实现语义和物理合理的布局。

Result: 生成高质量、语义准确的3D场景，在室内和开放域场景中均优于基线方法。

Conclusion: HOLODECK 2.0在游戏建模等应用中展示了高效生成沉浸式环境的潜力。

Abstract: 3D scene generation plays a crucial role in gaming, artistic creation,
virtual reality and many other domains. However, current 3D scene design still
relies heavily on extensive manual effort from creators, and existing automated
methods struggle to generate open-domain scenes or support flexible editing. As
a result, generating 3D worlds directly from text has garnered increasing
attention. In this paper, we introduce HOLODECK 2.0, an advanced
vision-language-guided framework for 3D world generation with support for
interactive scene editing based on human feedback. HOLODECK 2.0 can generate
diverse and stylistically rich 3D scenes (e.g., realistic, cartoon, anime, and
cyberpunk styles) that exhibit high semantic fidelity to fine-grained input
descriptions, suitable for both indoor and open-domain environments. HOLODECK
2.0 leverages vision-language models (VLMs) to identify and parse the objects
required in a scene and generates corresponding high-quality assets via
state-of-the-art 3D generative models. It then iteratively applies spatial
constraints derived from the VLMs to achieve semantically coherent and
physically plausible layouts. Human evaluations and CLIP-based assessments
demonstrate that HOLODECK 2.0 effectively generates high-quality scenes closely
aligned with detailed textual descriptions, consistently outperforming
baselines across indoor and open-domain scenarios. Additionally, we provide
editing capabilities that flexibly adapt to human feedback, supporting layout
refinement and style-consistent object edits. Finally, we present a practical
application of HOLODECK 2.0 in procedural game modeling, generating visually
rich and immersive environments, potentially boosting efficiency.

with both robustness and naturalness. To ensure the robustness of
\textit{RopStitch}, we propose to incorporate the universal prior of content
perception into the image stitching model by a dual-branch architecture. It
separately captures coarse and fine features and integrates them to achieve
highly generalizable performance across diverse unseen real-world scenes.
Concretely, the dual-branch model consists of a pretrained branch to capture
semantically invariant representations and a learnable branch to extract
fine-grained discriminative features, which are then merged into a whole by a
controllable factor at the correlation level. Besides, considering that content
alignment and structural preservation are often contradictory to each other, we
propose a concept of virtual optimal planes to relieve this conflict. To this
end, we model this problem as a process of estimating homography decomposition
coefficients, and design an iterative coefficient predictor and minimal
semantic distortion constraint to identify the optimal plane. This scheme is
finally incorporated into \textit{RopStitch} by warping both views onto the
optimal plane bidirectionally. Extensive experiments across various datasets
demonstrate that \textit{RopStitch} significantly outperforms existing methods,
particularly in scene robustness and content naturalness. The code is available

Abstract: Over the past two decades, mobile imaging has experienced a profound
transformation, with cell phones rapidly eclipsing all other forms of digital
photography in popularity. Today's cell phones are equipped with a diverse
range of imaging technologies - laser depth ranging, multi-focal camera arrays,
and split-pixel sensors - alongside non-visual sensors such as gyroscopes,
accelerometers, and magnetometers. This, combined with on-board integrated
chips for image and signal processing, makes the cell phone a versatile
pocket-sized computational imaging platform. Parallel to this, we have seen in
recent years how neural fields - small neural networks trained to map
continuous spatial input coordinates to output signals - enable the
reconstruction of complex scenes without explicit data representations such as
pixel arrays or point clouds. In this thesis, I demonstrate how carefully
designed neural field models can compactly represent complex geometry and
lighting effects. Enabling applications such as depth estimation, layer
separation, and image stitching directly from collected in-the-wild mobile
photography data. These methods outperform state-of-the-art approaches without
relying on complex pre-processing steps, labeled ground truth data, or machine
learning priors. Instead, they leverage well-constructed, self-regularized
models that tackle challenging inverse problems through stochastic gradient
descent, fitting directly to raw measurements from a smartphone.

Abstract: Monitoring construction progress is crucial yet resource-intensive, prompting
the exploration of computer-vision-based methodologies for enhanced efficiency
and scalability. Traditional data acquisition methods, primarily focusing on
indoor environments, falter in construction site's complex, cluttered, and
dynamically changing conditions. This paper critically evaluates the
application of two advanced 3D segmentation methods, Segment Anything Model
(SAM) and Mask3D, in challenging outdoor and indoor conditions. Trained
initially on indoor datasets, both models' adaptability and performance are
assessed in real-world construction settings, highlighting the gap in current
segmentation approaches due to the absence of benchmarks for outdoor scenarios.
Through a comparative analysis, this study not only showcases the relative
effectiveness of SAM and Mask3D but also addresses the critical need for
tailored segmentation workflows capable of extracting actionable insights from
construction site data, thereby advancing the field towards more automated and
precise monitoring techniques.

Conclusion: SINGAD通过自监督优化和几何误差传播，显著提升了单图像法线估计的准确性和一致性。

Abstract: The lack of spatial dimensional information remains a challenge in normal
estimation from a single image. Recent diffusion-based methods have
demonstrated significant potential in 2D-to-3D implicit mapping, they rely on
data-driven statistical priors and miss the explicit modeling of light-surface
interaction, leading to multi-view normal direction conflicts. Moreover, the
discrete sampling mechanism of diffusion models causes gradient discontinuity
in differentiable rendering reconstruction modules, preventing 3D geometric
errors from being backpropagated to the normal generation network, thereby
forcing existing methods to depend on dense normal annotations. This paper
proposes SINGAD, a novel Self-supervised framework from a single Image for
Normal estimation via 3D GAussian splatting guided Diffusion. By integrating
physics-driven light-interaction modeling and a differentiable rendering-based
reprojection strategy, our framework directly converts 3D geometric errors into
normal optimization signals, solving the challenges of multi-view geometric
inconsistency and data dependency. Specifically, the framework constructs a
light-interaction-driven 3DGS reparameterization model to generate multi-scale
geometric features consistent with light transport principles, ensuring
multi-view normal consistency. A cross-domain feature fusion module is designed
within a conditional diffusion model, embedding geometric priors to constrain
normal generation while maintaining accurate geometric error propagation.
Furthermore, a differentiable 3D reprojection loss strategy is introduced for
self-supervised optimization that minimizes geometric error between the
reconstructed and input image, eliminating dependence on annotated normal
datasets. Quantitative evaluations on the Google Scanned Objects dataset
demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across
multiple metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在训练成本高且未充分利用预训练模型能力的问题下，需要一种更高效的方法来整合视觉合成与语言模型的推理能力。

Method: 使用patch级CLIP图像嵌入作为潜在变量，通过轻量级ControlNet适配扩散模型，并初始化MLLM的视觉生成分支以保留其多模态推理能力。

Result: Bifrost-1在视觉保真度和多模态理解上表现优异，且训练计算成本显著降低。

Conclusion: 该框架为高效整合视觉合成与语言模型推理提供了可行方案，并通过实验验证了其设计有效性。

Abstract: There is growing interest in integrating high-fidelity visual synthesis
capabilities into large language models (LLMs) without compromising their
strong reasoning capabilities. Existing methods that directly train LLMs or
bridge LLMs and diffusion models usually suffer from costly training since the
backbone LLMs have not seen image representations during pretraining. We
present Bifrost-1, a unified framework that bridges pretrained multimodal LLMs
(MLLMs) and diffusion models using patch-level CLIP image embeddings as latent
variables, which are natively aligned with the MLLM's CLIP visual encoder.
These patch-level image embeddings are integrated into the diffusion model with
a lightweight adaptation of its ControlNet. To retain the original multimodal
reasoning capabilities of MLLMs, we equip the MLLM with a visual generation
branch initialized from the original MLLM parameters when predicting the
patch-level image embeddings. By seamlessly integrating pretrained MLLMs and
diffusion models with patch-level CLIP latents, our framework enables
high-fidelity controllable image generation with significant training
efficiency. Our experiments demonstrate that Bifrost-1 achieves comparable or
better performance than previous methods in terms of visual fidelity and
multimodal understanding, with substantially lower compute during training. We
also provide comprehensive ablation studies showing the effectiveness of our
design choices.

Motivation: 机器人操作中高级任务语义与低级几何特征之间的割裂问题限制了视觉语言模型的能力。

Method: 提出PASG框架，包括自动几何基元提取、VLM驱动的语义锚定和空间语义推理基准。

Result: 在多样化场景中，PASG的性能接近人工标注，实现了更细粒度的语义-功能理解。

Conclusion: PASG为机器人操作中几何基元与任务语义的统一提供了新范式。

Abstract: The fragmentation between high-level task semantics and low-level geometric
features remains a persistent challenge in robotic manipulation. While
vision-language models (VLMs) have shown promise in generating affordance-aware
visual representations, the lack of semantic grounding in canonical spaces and
reliance on manual annotations severely limit their ability to capture dynamic
semantic-affordance relationships. To address these, we propose Primitive-Aware
Semantic Grounding (PASG), a closed-loop framework that introduces: (1)
Automatic primitive extraction through geometric feature aggregation, enabling
cross-category detection of keypoints and axes; (2) VLM-driven semantic
anchoring that dynamically couples geometric primitives with functional
affordances and task-relevant description; (3) A spatial-semantic reasoning
benchmark and a fine-tuned VLM (Qwen2.5VL-PA). We demonstrate PASG's
effectiveness in practical robotic manipulation tasks across diverse scenarios,
achieving performance comparable to manual annotations. PASG achieves a
finer-grained semantic-affordance understanding of objects, establishing a
unified paradigm for bridging geometric primitives with task semantics in
robotic manipulation.

Motivation: 将3D场景重建与4D人体动画无缝集成仍存在挑战，如位置和比例不匹配、风格不一致以及相机轨迹需求。

Result: 实验表明，AnimateScene能生成具有高几何细节和时空一致性的动态场景视频。

Conclusion: AnimateScene成功解决了3D场景与4D人体动画集成的关键问题，实现了视觉上吸引人的结果。

Abstract: 3D scene reconstruction and 4D human animation have seen rapid progress and
broad adoption in recent years. However, seamlessly integrating reconstructed
scenes with 4D human animation to produce visually engaging results remains
challenging. One key difficulty lies in placing the human at the correct
location and scale within the scene while avoiding unrealistic
interpenetration. Another challenge is that the human and the background may
exhibit different lighting and style, leading to unrealistic composites. In
addition, appealing character motion videos are often accompanied by camera
movements, which means that the viewpoints need to be reconstructed along a
specified trajectory. We present AnimateScene, which addresses the above issues
in a unified framework. First, we design an accurate placement module that
automatically determines a plausible 3D position for the human and prevents any
interpenetration within the scene during motion. Second, we propose a
training-free style alignment method that adapts the 4D human representation to
match the background's lighting and style, achieving coherent visual
integration. Finally, we design a joint post-reconstruction method for both the
4D human and the 3D scene that allows camera trajectories to be inserted,
enabling the final rendered video to feature visually appealing camera
movements. Extensive experiments show that AnimateScene generates dynamic scene
videos with high geometric detail and spatiotemporal coherence across various
camera and action combinations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度补全模型在从源数据转移到目标数据时，由于协变量偏移导致预测错误，需要一种无需目标数据先验的适应方法。

Method: 利用对抗扰动探索数据空间，训练能量模型评估深度预测的分布内或外情况，并在测试时通过最小化能量调整模型参数。

Result: 在三个室内和三个室外数据集上，ETA平均优于现有方法，室外提升6.94%，室内提升10.23%。

Conclusion: ETA是一种有效的测试时适应方法，无需目标数据先验即可显著提升模型在新环境下的性能。

Abstract: We propose a method for test-time adaptation of pretrained depth completion
models. Depth completion models, trained on some ``source'' data, often predict
erroneous outputs when transferred to ``target'' data captured in novel
environmental conditions due to a covariate shift. The crux of our method lies
in quantifying the likelihood of depth predictions belonging to the source data
distribution. The challenge is in the lack of access to out-of-distribution
(target) data prior to deployment. Hence, rather than making assumptions
regarding the target distribution, we utilize adversarial perturbations as a
mechanism to explore the data space. This enables us to train an energy model
that scores local regions of depth predictions as in- or out-of-distribution.
We update the parameters of pretrained depth completion models at test time to
minimize energy, effectively aligning test-time predictions to those of the
source distribution. We call our method ``Energy-based Test-time Adaptation'',
or ETA for short. We evaluate our method across three indoor and three outdoor
datasets, where ETA improve over the previous state-of-the-art method by an
average of 6.94% for outdoors and 10.23% for indoors. Project Page:

Result: 在多个视频计算机视觉任务中，方法实现了显著加速且性能损失较小。

Conclusion: 该方法通过优化前端计算和运动估计，显著提升了视频计算机视觉系统的效率。

Abstract: The efficiency of video computer vision system remains a challenging task due
to the high temporal redundancy inside a video. Existing works have been
proposed for efficient vision computer vision. However, they do not fully
reduce the temporal redundancy and neglect the front end computation overhead.
In this paper, we propose an efficient video computer vision system. First,
image signal processor is removed and Bayer-format data is directly fed into
video computer vision models, thus saving the front end computation. Second,
instead of optical flow models and video codecs, a fast block matching-based
motion estimation algorithm is proposed specifically for efficient video
computer vision, with a MV refinement module. To correct the error,
context-aware block refinement network is introduced to refine regions with
large error. To further balance the accuracy and efficiency, a frame selection
strategy is employed. Experiments on multiple video computer vision tasks
demonstrate that our method achieves significant acceleration with slight
performance loss.

Conclusion: 提出的框架在多模态情感识别任务中表现出色，验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Emotion recognition plays a vital role in enhancing human-computer
interaction. In this study, we tackle the MER-SEMI challenge of the MER2025
competition by proposing a novel multimodal emotion recognition framework. To
address the issue of data scarcity, we leverage large-scale pre-trained models
to extract informative features from visual, audio, and textual modalities.
Specifically, for the visual modality, we design a dual-branch visual encoder
that captures both global frame-level features and localized facial
representations. For the textual modality, we introduce a context-enriched
method that employs large language models to enrich emotional cues within the
input text. To effectively integrate these multimodal features, we propose a
fusion strategy comprising two key components, i.e., self-attention mechanisms
for dynamic modality weighting, and residual connections to preserve original
representations. Beyond architectural design, we further refine noisy labels in
the training set by a multi-source labeling strategy. Our approach achieves a
substantial performance improvement over the official baseline on the
MER2025-SEMI dataset, attaining a weighted F-score of 87.49% compared to
78.63%, thereby validating the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法因缺乏结构化配对数据，导致化妆细节粗糙且难以平衡身份和化妆保真度。

Method: 引入MakeupQuad数据集，提出EvoMakeup框架，通过多阶段蒸馏迭代提升数据与模型质量。

Result: EvoMakeup在真实场景中表现优异，支持高保真、可控的多任务化妆编辑。

Conclusion: 方法在化妆保真度和身份保留上取得平衡，优于现有技术。

Abstract: Facial makeup editing aims to realistically transfer makeup from a reference
to a target face. Existing methods often produce low-quality results with
coarse makeup details and struggle to preserve both identity and makeup
fidelity, mainly due to the lack of structured paired data -- where source and
result share identity, and reference and result share identical makeup. To
address this, we introduce MakeupQuad, a large-scale, high-quality dataset with
non-makeup faces, references, edited results, and textual makeup descriptions.
Building on this, we propose EvoMakeup, a unified training framework that
mitigates image degradation during multi-stage distillation, enabling iterative
improvement of both data and model quality. Although trained solely on
synthetic data, EvoMakeup generalizes well and outperforms prior methods on
real-world benchmarks. It supports high-fidelity, controllable, multi-task
makeup editing -- including full-face and partial reference-based editing, as
well as text-driven makeup editing -- within a single model. Experimental
results demonstrate that our method achieves superior makeup fidelity and
identity preservation, effectively balancing both aspects. Code and dataset
will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in visual mathematical reasoning across various existing
benchmarks. However, these benchmarks are predominantly based on clean or
processed multimodal inputs, without incorporating the images provided by
real-world Kindergarten through 12th grade (K-12) educational users. To address
this gap, we introduce MathReal, a meticulously curated dataset comprising
2,000 mathematical questions with images captured by handheld mobile devices in
authentic scenarios. Each question is an image, containing the question text
and visual element. We systematically classify the real images into three
primary categories: image quality degradation, perspective variation, and
irrelevant content interference, which are further delineated into 14
subcategories. Additionally, MathReal spans five core knowledge and ability
categories, which encompass three question types and are divided into three
difficulty levels. To comprehensively evaluate the multimodal mathematical
reasoning abilities of state-of-the-art MLLMs in real-world scenarios, we
design six experimental settings that enable a systematic analysis of their
performance. Through extensive experimentation, we find that the
problem-solving abilities of existing MLLMs are significantly challenged in
realistic educational contexts. Based on this, we conduct a thorough analysis
of their performance and error patterns, providing insights into their
recognition, comprehension, and reasoning capabilities, and outlining
directions for future improvements. Data and code:

<details>

Motivation: 现有基于扩散模型的自动驾驶方法依赖Transformer融合，存在计算复杂度高和空间先验不足的问题，限制了高分辨率特征的使用和BEV表示的有效建模。

Method: 1. 使用几何增强的LiDAR表示替代传统直方图表示；2. 提出分层门控Mamba融合（GM-Fusion）架构，用高效的SSM替代Transformer。

Result: 在NAVSIM基准测试中，GMF-Drive显著优于DiffusionDrive，达到新的SOTA性能。

Conclusion: 任务特定的SSM在性能和效率上均优于通用Transformer，验证了GMF-Drive的有效性。

Abstract: Diffusion-based models are redefining the state-of-the-art in end-to-end
autonomous driving, yet their performance is increasingly hampered by a
reliance on transformer-based fusion. These architectures face fundamental
limitations: quadratic computational complexity restricts the use of
high-resolution features, and a lack of spatial priors prevents them from
effectively modeling the inherent structure of Bird's Eye View (BEV)
representations. This paper introduces GMF-Drive (Gated Mamba Fusion for
Driving), an end-to-end framework that overcomes these challenges through two
principled innovations. First, we supersede the information-limited
histogram-based LiDAR representation with a geometrically-augmented pillar
format encoding shape descriptors and statistical features, preserving critical
3D geometric details. Second, we propose a novel hierarchical gated mamba
fusion (GM-Fusion) architecture that substitutes an expensive transformer with
a highly efficient, spatially-aware state-space model (SSM). Our core BEV-SSM
leverages directional sequencing and adaptive fusion mechanisms to capture
long-range dependencies with linear complexity, while explicitly respecting the
unique spatial properties of the driving scene. Extensive experiments on the
challenging NAVSIM benchmark demonstrate that GMF-Drive achieves a new
state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming DiffusionDrive.
Comprehensive ablation studies validate the efficacy of each component,
demonstrating that task-specific SSMs can surpass a general-purpose transformer
in both performance and efficiency for autonomous driving.

Abstract: Recent advances in novel view synthesis (NVS) have enabled real-time
rendering with 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). However, existing methods struggle
with artifacts and missing regions when rendering from viewpoints that deviate
from the training trajectory, limiting seamless scene exploration. To address
this, we propose a 3DGS-based pipeline that generates additional training views
to enhance reconstruction. We introduce an information-gain-driven virtual
camera placement strategy to maximize scene coverage, followed by video
diffusion priors to refine rendered results. Fine-tuning 3D Gaussians with
these enhanced views significantly improves reconstruction quality. To evaluate
our method, we present Wild-Explore, a benchmark designed for challenging scene
exploration. Experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing
3DGS-based methods, enabling high-quality, artifact-free rendering from
arbitrary viewpoints.

Abstract: Sub-visible particle analysis using flow imaging microscopy combined with
deep learning has proven effective in identifying particle types, enabling the
distinction of harmless components such as silicone oil from protein particles.
However, the scarcity of available data and severe imbalance between particle
types within datasets remain substantial hurdles when applying multi-class
classifiers to such problems, often forcing researchers to rely on less
effective methods. The aforementioned issue is particularly challenging for
particle types that appear unintentionally and in lower numbers, such as
silicone oil and air bubbles, as opposed to protein particles, where obtaining
large numbers of images through controlled settings is comparatively
straightforward. In this work, we develop a state-of-the-art diffusion model to
address data imbalance by generating high-fidelity images that can augment
training datasets, enabling the effective training of multi-class deep neural
networks. We validate this approach by demonstrating that the generated samples
closely resemble real particle images in terms of visual quality and structure.
To assess the effectiveness of using diffusion-generated images in training
datasets, we conduct large-scale experiments on a validation dataset comprising
500,000 protein particle images and demonstrate that this approach improves
classification performance with no negligible downside. Finally, to promote
open research and reproducibility, we publicly release both our diffusion
models and the trained multi-class deep neural network classifiers, along with
a straightforward interface for easy integration into future studies, at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数据增强技术忽视深度感知变换，限制了模型在真实深度变化中的鲁棒性。

Result: 在FathomNet和UTDAC2020数据集上验证了Depth-Jitter对模型稳定性的提升，尤其在深度敏感环境中表现突出。

Conclusion: Depth-Jitter为深度感知数据增强提供了新思路，支持进一步研究深度相关学习策略。

Abstract: Depth information is essential in computer vision, particularly in underwater
imaging, robotics, and autonomous navigation. However, conventional
augmentation techniques overlook depth aware transformations, limiting model
robustness in real world depth variations. In this paper, we introduce
Depth-Jitter, a novel depth-based augmentation technique that simulates natural
depth variations to improve generalization. Our approach applies adaptive depth
offsetting, guided by depth variance thresholds, to generate synthetic depth
perturbations while preserving structural integrity. We evaluate Depth-Jitter
on two benchmark datasets, FathomNet and UTDAC2020 demonstrating its impact on
model stability under diverse depth conditions. Extensive experiments compare
Depth-Jitter against traditional augmentation strategies such as ColorJitter,
analyzing performance across varying learning rates, encoders, and loss
functions. While Depth-Jitter does not always outperform conventional methods
in absolute performance, it consistently enhances model stability and
generalization in depth-sensitive environments. These findings highlight the
potential of depth-aware augmentation for real-world applications and provide a
foundation for further research into depth-based learning strategies. The
proposed technique is publicly available to support advancements in depth-aware
augmentation. The code is publicly available on

TL;DR: Spectrum是一种统一网络，用于细粒度的人体部位和衣物解析，通过改进的图像到纹理扩散模型实现更好的语义分割。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在人体部位和衣物解析中使用固定掩码类别，无法区分细粒度衣物类型；而开放词汇分割方法通常将整个人体归为一类，缺乏对衣物和身体部位的详细解析。

Method: Spectrum利用经过微调的图像到纹理（I2Tx）扩散模型提取特征，并通过提示引导生成语义有效的掩码，实现细粒度解析。

Result: 实验表明，Spectrum在身体部位、衣物类别和未见过的衣物分割任务中均优于基线方法。

Conclusion: Spectrum通过改进的扩散模型实现了更精确的人体部位和衣物解析，适用于复杂场景。

Abstract: Existing methods for human parsing into body parts and clothing often use
fixed mask categories with broad labels that obscure fine-grained clothing
types. Recent open-vocabulary segmentation approaches leverage pretrained
text-to-image (T2I) diffusion model features for strong zero-shot transfer, but
typically group entire humans into a single person category, failing to
distinguish diverse clothing or detailed body parts. To address this, we
propose Spectrum, a unified network for part-level pixel parsing (body parts
and clothing) and instance-level grouping. While diffusion-based
open-vocabulary models generalize well across tasks, their internal
representations are not specialized for detailed human parsing. We observe
that, unlike diffusion models with broad representations, image-driven 3D
texture generators maintain faithful correspondence to input images, enabling
stronger representations for parsing diverse clothing and body parts. Spectrum
introduces a novel repurposing of an Image-to-Texture (I2Tx) diffusion model --
obtained by fine-tuning a T2I model on 3D human texture maps -- for improved
alignment with body parts and clothing. From an input image, we extract
human-part internal features via the I2Tx diffusion model and generate
semantically valid masks aligned to diverse clothing categories through
prompt-guided grounding. Once trained, Spectrum produces semantic segmentation
maps for every visible body part and clothing category, ignoring standalone
garments or irrelevant objects, for any number of humans in the scene. We
conduct extensive cross-dataset experiments -- separately assessing body parts,
clothing parts, unseen clothing categories, and full-body masks -- and
demonstrate that Spectrum consistently outperforms baseline methods in
prompt-based segmentation.

Method: 基于RectifiedFlow框架，引入PerRFI反转策略和Inversion Latent Injection技术，结合Disentangled Prompt Guidance和Canny-conditioned ControlNet。

Result: 在PIE数据集上，InstantEdit在速度和编辑质量上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: InstantEdit是一种高效且高质量的文本引导图像编辑方法，适用于快速编辑任务。

Abstract: We propose a fast text-guided image editing method called InstantEdit based
on the RectifiedFlow framework, which is structured as a few-step editing
process that preserves critical content while following closely to textual
instructions. Our approach leverages the straight sampling trajectories of
RectifiedFlow by introducing a specialized inversion strategy called PerRFI. To
maintain consistent while editable results for RectifiedFlow model, we further
propose a novel regeneration method, Inversion Latent Injection, which
effectively reuses latent information obtained during inversion to facilitate
more coherent and detailed regeneration. Additionally, we propose a
Disentangled Prompt Guidance technique to balance editability with detail
preservation, and integrate a Canny-conditioned ControlNet to incorporate
structural cues and suppress artifacts. Evaluation on the PIE image editing
dataset demonstrates that InstantEdit is not only fast but also achieves better
qualitative and quantitative results compared to state-of-the-art few-step
editing methods.

Abstract: In this paper, we present our solution for the semi-supervised learning track
(MER-SEMI) in MER2025. We propose a comprehensive framework, grounded in the
principle that "more is better," to construct a robust Mixture of Experts (MoE)
emotion recognition system. Our approach integrates a diverse range of input
modalities as independent experts, including novel signals such as knowledge
from large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and temporal Action Unit (AU)
information. To effectively utilize unlabeled data, we introduce a
consensus-based pseudo-labeling strategy, generating high-quality labels from
the agreement between a baseline model and Gemini, which are then used in a
two-stage training paradigm. Finally, we employ a multi-expert voting ensemble
combined with a rule-based re-ranking process to correct prediction bias and
better align the outputs with human preferences. Evaluated on the MER2025-SEMI
challenge dataset, our method achieves an F1-score of 0.8772 on the test set,
ranking 2nd in the track. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Fourier-VLM通过频域压缩视觉表示，显著减少计算开销和推理延迟，同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型（VLMs）中大量视觉令牌增加了上下文长度，导致高计算开销和推理延迟。

Method: 采用二维离散余弦变换（DCT）对视觉特征进行低通滤波，利用快速傅里叶变换（FFT）高效计算。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异，推理FLOPs减少83.8%，生成速度提升31.2%。

Conclusion: Fourier-VLM在高效性和实用性上具有显著优势，适用于多种架构。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) typically replace the predefined image
placeholder token (<image>) in textual instructions with visual features from
an image encoder, forming the input to a backbone Large Language Model (LLM).
However, the large number of vision tokens significantly increases the context
length, leading to high computational overhead and inference latency. While
previous efforts mitigate this by selecting only important visual features or
leveraging learnable queries to reduce token count, they often compromise
performance or introduce substantial extra costs. In response, we propose
Fourier-VLM, a simple yet efficient method that compresses visual
representations in the frequency domain. Our approach is motivated by the
observation that vision features output from the vision encoder exhibit
concentrated energy in low-frequency components. Leveraging this, we apply a
low-pass filter to the vision features using a two-dimentional Discrete Cosine
Transform (DCT). Notably, the DCT is efficiently computed via the Fast Fourier
Transform (FFT) operator with a time complexity of $\mathcal{O}(n\log n)$,
minimizing the extra computational cost while introducing no additional
parameters. Extensive experiments across various image-based benchmarks
demonstrate that Fourier-VLM achieves competitive performance with strong
generalizability across both LLaVA and Qwen-VL architectures. Crucially, it
reduce inference FLOPs by up to 83.8% and boots generation speed by 31.2%
compared to LLaVA-v1.5, highlighting the superior efficiency and practicality.

Motivation: 现有文本引导图像编辑方法生成整个目标图像，导致计算成本高且非编辑区域重建偏差影响编辑质量。

Method: 提出NEP方法，基于自回归图像生成，仅再生需要编辑的区域；预训练一个任意顺序的自回归文本到图像（T2I）模型，支持零样本图像编辑。

Result: 在广泛使用的图像编辑基准测试中达到新最优性能，并支持零样本测试时缩放（TTS）。

Conclusion: NEP方法有效解决了现有方法的局限性，提升了编辑质量和效率。

Abstract: Text-guided image editing involves modifying a source image based on a
language instruction and, typically, requires changes to only small local
regions. However, existing approaches generate the entire target image rather
than selectively regenerate only the intended editing areas. This results in
(1) unnecessary computational costs and (2) a bias toward reconstructing
non-editing regions, which compromises the quality of the intended edits. To
resolve these limitations, we propose to formulate image editing as Next
Editing-token Prediction (NEP) based on autoregressive image generation, where
only regions that need to be edited are regenerated, thus avoiding unintended
modification to the non-editing areas. To enable any-region editing, we propose
to pre-train an any-order autoregressive text-to-image (T2I) model. Once
trained, it is capable of zero-shot image editing and can be easily adapted to
NEP for image editing, which achieves a new state-of-the-art on widely used
image editing benchmarks. Moreover, our model naturally supports test-time
scaling (TTS) through iteratively refining its generation in a zero-shot
manner. The project page is: https://nep-bigai.github.io/

TL;DR: VQAThinker是一个基于推理的视频质量评估框架，利用多模态模型和强化学习解决现有模型泛化性和可解释性不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频质量评估模型在泛化性和可解释性方面存在不足，限制了其实际应用。

Method: 采用GRPO强化学习算法，结合三种VQA特定奖励（回归、排序和时间一致性奖励），模拟人类感知决策。

Result: 在域内和域外基准测试中表现优异，同时在失真归因和质量描述任务中优于现有模型。

Conclusion: 强化学习为仅依赖分数级监督构建泛化性强且可解释的VQA模型提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Video quality assessment (VQA) aims to objectively quantify perceptual
quality degradation in alignment with human visual perception. Despite recent
advances, existing VQA models still suffer from two critical limitations:
\textit{poor generalization to out-of-distribution (OOD) videos} and
\textit{limited explainability}, which restrict their applicability in
real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose
\textbf{VQAThinker}, a reasoning-based VQA framework that leverages large
multimodal models (LMMs) with reinforcement learning to jointly model video
quality understanding and scoring, emulating human perceptual decision-making.
Specifically, we adopt group relative policy optimization (GRPO), a rule-guided
reinforcement learning algorithm that enables reasoning over video quality
under score-level supervision, and introduce three VQA-specific rewards: (1) a
\textbf{bell-shaped regression reward} that increases rapidly as the prediction
error decreases and becomes progressively less sensitive near the ground truth;
(2) a \textbf{pairwise ranking reward} that guides the model to correctly
determine the relative quality between video pairs; and (3) a \textbf{temporal
consistency reward} that encourages the model to prefer temporally coherent
videos over their perturbed counterparts. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that VQAThinker achieves state-of-the-art performance on both in-domain and OOD
VQA benchmarks, showing strong generalization for video quality scoring.
Furthermore, evaluations on video quality understanding tasks validate its
superiority in distortion attribution and quality description compared to
existing explainable VQA models and LMMs. These findings demonstrate that
reinforcement learning offers an effective pathway toward building
generalizable and explainable VQA models solely with score-level supervision.

Conclusion: LV-Net为LV形状分析提供了更可靠的工具，并在疾病研究中展示了应用潜力。

Abstract: Lateral ventricle (LV) shape analysis holds promise as a biomarker for
neurological diseases; however, challenges remain due to substantial shape
variability across individuals and segmentation difficulties arising from
limited MRI resolution. We introduce LV-Net, a novel framework for producing
individualized 3D LV meshes from brain MRI by deforming an anatomy-aware joint
LV-hippocampus template mesh. By incorporating anatomical relationships
embedded within the joint template, LV-Net reduces boundary segmentation
artifacts and improves reconstruction robustness. In addition, by classifying
the vertices of the template mesh based on their anatomical adjacency, our
method enhances point correspondence across subjects, leading to more accurate
LV shape statistics. We demonstrate that LV-Net achieves superior
reconstruction accuracy, even in the presence of segmentation imperfections,
and delivers more reliable shape descriptors across diverse datasets. Finally,
we apply LV-Net to Alzheimer's disease analysis, identifying LV subregions that
show significantly associations with the disease relative to cognitively normal
controls. The codes for LV shape modeling are available at

Abstract: Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) is closer than ever to becoming a

and work with various modalities, including text, image, video, and audio.
Despite recent efforts, satellite spectral imagery, as an additional modality,
has yet to receive the attention it deserves. This area presents unique
challenges, but also holds great promise in advancing the capabilities of AGI
in understanding the natural world. In this paper, we argue why Earth
Observation data is useful for an intelligent model, and then we review
existing benchmarks and highlight their limitations in evaluating the
generalization ability of foundation models in this domain. This paper
emphasizes the need for a more comprehensive benchmark to evaluate earth
observation models. To facilitate this, we propose a comprehensive set of tasks
that a benchmark should encompass to effectively assess a model's ability to
understand and interact with Earth observation data.

Motivation: HybridEVS相机结合Quad Bayer CFA传感器和事件像素时，由于事件像素缺乏颜色信息，导致去马赛克过程中出现伪影和混叠问题，现有方法难以在资源有限的移动设备上有效解决。

Method: TSANet采用两阶段网络设计，分别处理事件像素修复和去马赛克，并引入轻量级的Cross-Swin State Block，利用位置先验和状态空间模型增强全局依赖。

Result: TSANet在模拟和真实HybridEVS数据上表现出色，PSNR和SSIM优于现有方法DemosaicFormer，同时参数和计算成本分别降低1.86倍和3.29倍。

Conclusion: TSANet为移动设备上的高效图像去马赛克提供了新思路，代码已开源。

Abstract: Event cameras like the Hybrid Event-based Vision Sensor (HybridEVS) camera
capture brightness changes as asynchronous "events" instead of frames, offering
advanced application on mobile photography. However, challenges arise from
combining a Quad Bayer Color Filter Array (CFA) sensor with event pixels
lacking color information, resulting in aliasing and artifacts on the
demosaicing process before downstream application. Current methods struggle to
address these issues, especially on resource-limited mobile devices. In
response, we introduce \textbf{TSANet}, a lightweight \textbf{T}wo-stage
network via \textbf{S}tate space augmented cross-\textbf{A}ttention, which can
handle event pixels inpainting and demosaicing separately, leveraging the
benefits of dividing complex tasks into manageable subtasks. Furthermore, we
introduce a lightweight Cross-Swin State Block that uniquely utilizes
positional prior for demosaicing and enhances global dependencies through the
state space model with linear complexity. In summary, TSANet demonstrates
excellent demosaicing performance on both simulated and real data of HybridEVS
while maintaining a lightweight model, averaging better results than the
previous state-of-the-art method DemosaicFormer across seven diverse datasets
in both PSNR and SSIM, while respectively reducing parameter and computation
costs by $1.86\times$ and $3.29\times$. Our approach presents new possibilities
for efficient image demosaicing on mobile devices. Code is available in the

Result: 实验证明，所提出的JoNet网络在SOD和COD任务上均表现出竞争力。

Conclusion: 联合学习SOD和COD任务是可行的，SCJoint和SBSS方法有效提升了网络性能。

Abstract: Salient object detection (SOD) and camouflaged object detection (COD) are two
closely related but distinct computer vision tasks. Although both are
class-agnostic segmentation tasks that map from RGB space to binary space, the
former aims to identify the most salient objects in the image, while the latter
focuses on detecting perfectly camouflaged objects that blend into the
background in the image. These two tasks exhibit strong contradictory
attributes. Previous works have mostly believed that joint learning of these
two tasks would confuse the network, reducing its performance on both tasks.
However, here we present an opposite perspective: with the correct approach to
learning, the network can simultaneously possess the capability to find both
salient and camouflaged objects, allowing both tasks to benefit from joint
learning. We propose SCJoint, a joint learning scheme for SOD and COD tasks,
assuming that the decoding processes of SOD and COD have different distribution
characteristics. The key to our method is to learn the respective means and
variances of the decoding processes for both tasks by inserting a minimal
amount of task-specific learnable parameters within a fully shared network
structure, thereby decoupling the contradictory attributes of the two tasks at
a minimal cost. Furthermore, we propose a saliency-based sampling strategy
(SBSS) to sample the training set of the SOD task to balance the training set
sizes of the two tasks. In addition, SBSS improves the training set quality and
shortens the training time. Based on the proposed SCJoint and SBSS, we train a
powerful generalist network, named JoNet, which has the ability to
simultaneously capture both ``salient" and ``camouflaged". Extensive
experiments demonstrate the competitive performance and effectiveness of our
proposed method. The code is available at https://github.com/linuxsino/JoNet.

Conclusion: BioMotion Arena 是一个具有挑战性的性能可视化基准，无需依赖真实数据。

Abstract: Evaluating the abilities of large models and manifesting their gaps are
challenging. Current benchmarks adopt either ground-truth-based score-form
evaluation on static datasets or indistinct textual chatbot-style human
preferences collection, which may not provide users with immediate, intuitive,
and perceptible feedback on performance differences. In this paper, we
introduce BioMotion Arena, a novel framework for evaluating large language
models (LLMs) and multimodal large language models (MLLMs) via visual
animation. Our methodology draws inspiration from the inherent visual
perception of motion patterns characteristic of living organisms that utilizes
point-light source imaging to amplify the performance discrepancies between
models. Specifically, we employ a pairwise comparison evaluation and collect
more than 45k votes for 53 mainstream LLMs and MLLMs on 90 biological motion
variants. Data analyses show that the crowd-sourced human votes are in good
agreement with those of expert raters, demonstrating the superiority of our
BioMotion Arena in offering discriminative feedback. We also find that over
90\% of evaluated models, including the cutting-edge open-source InternVL3 and
proprietary Claude-4 series, fail to produce fundamental humanoid point-light
groups, much less smooth and biologically plausible motions. This enables
BioMotion Arena to serve as a challenging benchmark for performance
visualization and a flexible evaluation framework without restrictions on

Abstract: To treat Trochlear Dysplasia (TD), current approaches rely mainly on
low-resolution clinical Magnetic Resonance (MR) scans and surgical intuition.
The surgeries are planned based on surgeons experience, have limited adoption
of minimally invasive techniques, and lead to inconsistent outcomes. We propose
a pipeline that generates super-resolved, patient-specific 3D pseudo-healthy
target morphologies from conventional clinical MR scans. First, we compute an
isotropic super-resolved MR volume using an Implicit Neural Representation
(INR). Next, we segment femur, tibia, patella, and fibula with a multi-label
custom-trained network. Finally, we train a Wavelet Diffusion Model (WDM) to
generate pseudo-healthy target morphologies of the trochlear region. In
contrast to prior work producing pseudo-healthy low-resolution 3D MR images,
our approach enables the generation of sub-millimeter resolved 3D shapes
compatible for pre- and intraoperative use. These can serve as preoperative
blueprints for reshaping the femoral groove while preserving the native patella
articulation. Furthermore, and in contrast to other work, we do not require a
CT for our pipeline - reducing the amount of radiation. We evaluated our
approach on 25 TD patients and could show that our target morphologies
significantly improve the sulcus angle (SA) and trochlear groove depth (TGD).

Method: 采用两阶段训练策略（先图像后视频），结合拼贴和生成模型的数据合成方法，并设计高效的编辑框架。

Result: DreamVE在关键编辑类型上表现优异，具备良好的泛化和迁移能力，但属性编辑性能稍弱。

Conclusion: DreamVE通过多源数据合成和高效框架设计，为指令式编辑提供了实用解决方案，代码和模型将开源。

Abstract: Instruction-based editing holds vast potential due to its simple and
efficient interactive editing format. However, instruction-based editing,
particularly for video, has been constrained by limited training data,
hindering its practical application. To this end, we introduce DreamVE, a
unified model for instruction-based image and video editing. Specifically, We
propose a two-stage training strategy: first image editing, then video editing.
This offers two main benefits: (1) Image data scales more easily, and models
are more efficient to train, providing useful priors for faster and better
video editing training. (2) Unifying image and video generation is natural and
aligns with current trends. Moreover, we present comprehensive training data
synthesis pipelines, including collage-based and generative model-based data
synthesis. The collage-based data synthesis combines foreground objects and
backgrounds to generate diverse editing data, such as object manipulation,
background changes, and text modifications. It can easily generate billions of
accurate, consistent, realistic, and diverse editing pairs. We pretrain DreamVE
on extensive collage-based data to achieve strong performance in key editing
types and enhance generalization and transfer capabilities. However,
collage-based data lacks some attribute editing cases, leading to a relative
drop in performance. In contrast, the generative model-based pipeline, despite
being hard to scale up, offers flexibility in handling attribute editing cases.
Therefore, we use generative model-based data to further fine-tune DreamVE.
Besides, we design an efficient and powerful editing framework for DreamVE. We
build on the SOTA T2V model and use a token concatenation with early drop
approach to inject source image guidance, ensuring strong consistency and
editability. The codes and models will be released.

TL;DR: SwiftVideo 是一个结合轨迹保持和分布匹配优势的统一稳定蒸馏框架，用于加速视频生成模型，减少推理步骤的同时保持高质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于扩散或流的视频生成模型需要多次迭代采样，计算开销大；现有蒸馏方法在少步设置下性能下降或产生更多伪影。

Method: 提出连续时间一致性蒸馏确保ODE轨迹精确保持，并引入双视角对齐（分布对齐和轨迹对齐）。

Result: 在OpenVid-1M基准测试中，SwiftVideo在少步视频生成中显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SwiftVideo通过统一框架有效解决了少步视频生成的性能问题，同时保持高质量。

Abstract: Diffusion-based or flow-based models have achieved significant progress in
video synthesis but require multiple iterative sampling steps, which incurs
substantial computational overhead. While many distillation methods that are
solely based on trajectory-preserving or distribution-matching have been
developed to accelerate video generation models, these approaches often suffer
from performance breakdown or increased artifacts under few-step settings. To
address these limitations, we propose \textbf{\emph{SwiftVideo}}, a unified and
stable distillation framework that combines the advantages of
trajectory-preserving and distribution-matching strategies. Our approach
introduces continuous-time consistency distillation to ensure precise
preservation of ODE trajectories. Subsequently, we propose a dual-perspective
alignment that includes distribution alignment between synthetic and real data
along with trajectory alignment across different inference steps. Our method
maintains high-quality video generation while substantially reducing the number
of inference steps. Quantitative evaluations on the OpenVid-1M benchmark
demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches in
few-step video generation.

TL;DR: 提出AdaptInfer框架，通过动态文本引导和跨模态注意力分析，自适应剪裁视觉令牌，显著降低推理成本同时保持高精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有剪裁方法依赖静态文本提示或注意力模式，未能利用推理中的动态信号，导致效率不足。

Method: 1. 动态文本引导剪裁机制，重用层间文本-文本注意力图；2. 离线分析跨模态注意力变化，设计高效剪裁策略。

Result: 在LLaVA-1.5-7B上，CUDA延迟降低61.3%，平均精度保持92.9%；相同令牌预算下超越SOTA。

Conclusion: AdaptInfer是一种轻量级、即插即用的通用框架，显著提升多模态推理效率。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved impressive performance on
multimodal reasoning tasks such as visual question answering (VQA), but their
inference cost remains a significant challenge due to the large number of
vision tokens processed during the prefill stage. Existing pruning methods
often rely on directly using the attention patterns or static text prompt
guidance, failing to exploit the dynamic internal signals generated during
inference. To address these issues, we propose AdaptInfer, a plug-and-play
framework for adaptive vision token pruning in VLMs. First, we introduce a
fine-grained, dynamic text-guided pruning mechanism that reuses layer-wise
text-to-text attention maps to construct soft priors over text-token
importance, allowing more informed scoring of vision tokens at each stage.
Second, we perform an offline analysis of cross-modal attention shifts and
identify consistent inflection locations in inference, which inspire us to
propose a more principled and efficient pruning schedule. Our method is
lightweight and plug-and-play, also generalizable across multi-modal tasks.
Experimental results have verified the effectiveness of the proposed method.
For example, it reduces CUDA latency by 61.3\% while maintaining an average
accuracy of 92.9\% on vanilla LLaVA-1.5-7B. Under the same token budget,
AdaptInfer surpasses SOTA in accuracy.

TL;DR: Q-CLIP是一个基于视觉语言模型（VLM）的视频质量评估（VQA）框架，通过共享跨模态适配器（SCMA）和可学习的质量提示，显著降低了计算成本并提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前VQA方法依赖大规模预训练数据集，存在语义知识迁移不足和计算资源消耗大的问题，而视觉语言模型（VLMs）在质量评估中展现出潜力。

Method: 提出Q-CLIP框架，使用SCMA增强视觉和文本表示，引入可学习的质量提示，并研究帧采样策略对性能的影响。

Result: Q-CLIP在多个VQA数据集上表现出色，帧差采样策略提升了泛化性能。

Conclusion: Q-CLIP为VQA提供了一种高效且性能优越的解决方案，展示了VLMs在质量评估中的潜力。

Abstract: Accurate and efficient Video Quality Assessment (VQA) has long been a key
research challenge. Current mainstream VQA methods typically improve
performance by pretraining on large-scale classification datasets (e.g.,
ImageNet, Kinetics-400), followed by fine-tuning on VQA datasets. However, this
strategy presents two significant challenges: (1) merely transferring semantic
knowledge learned from pretraining is insufficient for VQA, as video quality
depends on multiple factors (e.g., semantics, distortion, motion, aesthetics);
(2) pretraining on large-scale datasets demands enormous computational
resources, often dozens or even hundreds of times greater than training
directly on VQA datasets. Recently, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown
remarkable generalization capabilities across a wide range of visual tasks, and
have begun to demonstrate promising potential in quality assessment. In this
work, we propose Q-CLIP, the first fully VLMs-based framework for VQA. Q-CLIP
enhances both visual and textual representations through a Shared Cross-Modal
Adapter (SCMA), which contains only a minimal number of trainable parameters
and is the only component that requires training. This design significantly
reduces computational cost. In addition, we introduce a set of five learnable
quality-level prompts to guide the VLMs in perceiving subtle quality
variations, thereby further enhancing the model's sensitivity to video quality.
Furthermore, we investigate the impact of different frame sampling strategies
on VQA performance, and find that frame-difference-based sampling leads to
better generalization performance across datasets. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Q-CLIP exhibits excellent performance on several VQA datasets.

Conclusion: 提出的方法能够生成多样且真实的反应动作，适用于不同情感条件下的交互任务。

Abstract: Emotion serves as an essential component in daily human interactions.
Existing human motion generation frameworks do not consider the impact of
emotions, which reduces naturalness and limits their application in interactive
tasks, such as human reaction synthesis. In this work, we introduce a novel
task: generating diverse reaction motions in response to different emotional
cues. However, learning emotion representation from limited motion data and
incorporating it into a motion generation framework remains a challenging
problem. To address the above obstacles, we introduce a semi-supervised emotion
prior in an actor-reactor diffusion model to facilitate emotion-driven reaction
synthesis. Specifically, based on the observation that motion clips within a
short sequence tend to share the same emotion, we first devise a
semi-supervised learning framework to train an emotion prior. With this prior,
we further train an actor-reactor diffusion model to generate reactions by
considering both spatial interaction and emotional response. Finally, given a
motion sequence of an actor, our approach can generate realistic reactions
under various emotional conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that our
model outperforms existing reaction generation methods. The code and data will
be made publicly available at https://ereact.github.io/

Motivation: 数字时代中，高级图像编辑工具威胁视觉内容的真实性，现有IML方法依赖大规模标注数据，但数据集缺乏规模和多样性，限制了模型性能。

Method: 提出UGD-IML框架，利用扩散模型学习数据分布，通过类嵌入机制和参数共享设计，实现IML和CIML任务的无缝切换。

Result: 在多个数据集上，UGD-IML在IML和CIML任务的F1指标上分别平均优于SOTA方法9.66和4.36。

Conclusion: UGD-IML通过生成模型和端到端设计，有效解决了数据标注效率低和依赖大规模数据的问题，同时提升了性能。

Abstract: In the digital age, advanced image editing tools pose a serious threat to the
integrity of visual content, making image forgery detection and localization a
key research focus. Most existing Image Manipulation Localization (IML) methods
rely on discriminative learning and require large, high-quality annotated
datasets. However, current datasets lack sufficient scale and diversity,
limiting model performance in real-world scenarios. To overcome this, recent
studies have explored Constrained IML (CIML), which generates pixel-level
annotations through algorithmic supervision. However, existing CIML approaches
often depend on complex multi-stage pipelines, making the annotation process
inefficient. In this work, we propose a novel generative framework based on
diffusion models, named UGD-IML, which for the first time unifies both IML and
CIML tasks within a single framework. By learning the underlying data
distribution, generative diffusion models inherently reduce the reliance on
large-scale labeled datasets, allowing our approach to perform effectively even
under limited data conditions. In addition, by leveraging a class embedding
mechanism and a parameter-sharing design, our model seamlessly switches between
IML and CIML modes without extra components or training overhead. Furthermore,
the end-to-end design enables our model to avoid cumbersome steps in the data
annotation process. Extensive experimental results on multiple datasets
demonstrate that UGD-IML outperforms the SOTA methods by an average of 9.66 and
4.36 in terms of F1 metrics for IML and CIML tasks, respectively. Moreover, the
proposed method also excels in uncertainty estimation, visualization and
robustness.

Conclusion: MCA框架具有通用性和高效性，能有效应对噪声标签挑战。

Abstract: With the increasing availability of 2D and 3D data, significant advancements
have been made in the field of cross-modal retrieval. Nevertheless, the
existence of imperfect annotations presents considerable challenges, demanding
robust solutions for 2D-3D cross-modal retrieval in the presence of noisy label
conditions. Existing methods generally address the issue of noise by dividing
samples independently within each modality, making them susceptible to
overfitting on corrupted labels. To address these issues, we propose a robust
2D-3D \textbf{M}ulti-level cross-modal adaptive \textbf{C}orrection and
\textbf{A}lignment framework (MCA). Specifically, we introduce a Multimodal
Joint label Correction (MJC) mechanism that leverages multimodal historical
self-predictions to jointly model the modality prediction consistency, enabling
reliable label refinement. Additionally, we propose a Multi-level Adaptive
Alignment (MAA) strategy to effectively enhance cross-modal feature semantics
and discrimination across different levels. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the superiority of our method, MCA, which achieves state-of-the-art performance
on both conventional and realistic noisy 3D benchmarks, highlighting its
generality and effectiveness.

Conclusion: 自监督学习框架和渐进注意力机制显著提升了手写数学表达式识别的性能，减少了对标注数据的依赖。

Abstract: Recognizing handwritten mathematical expressions (HMER) is a challenging task
due to the inherent two-dimensional structure, varying symbol scales, and
complex spatial relationships among symbols. In this paper, we present a
self-supervised learning (SSL) framework for HMER that eliminates the need for
expensive labeled data. Our approach begins by pretraining an image encoder
using a combination of global and local contrastive loss, enabling the model to
learn both holistic and fine-grained representations. A key contribution of
this work is a novel self-supervised attention network, which is trained using
a progressive spatial masking strategy. This attention mechanism is designed to
learn semantically meaningful focus regions, such as operators, exponents, and
nested mathematical notation, without requiring any supervision. The
progressive masking curriculum encourages the network to become increasingly
robust to missing or occluded visual information, ultimately improving
structural understanding. Our complete pipeline consists of (1) self-supervised
pretraining of the encoder, (2) self-supervised attention learning, and (3)
supervised fine-tuning with a transformer decoder to generate LATEX sequences.
Extensive experiments on CROHME benchmarks demonstrate that our method
outperforms existing SSL and fully supervised baselines, validating the
effectiveness of our progressive attention mechanism in enhancing HMER
performance. Our codebase can be found here.

Motivation: 解决深度神经网络（DNNs）内部表示不透明的问题，并改进FMCE方法缺乏实验验证和闭环集成的局限性。

Method: 提出FMCE-Net++框架，利用预训练的FMCE-Net生成特征图收敛分数（FMCS），结合任务标签通过表示辅助损失（RAL）优化主干网络。

Result: 在MNIST、CIFAR-10等数据集上验证，FMCE-Net++显著提升模型性能，如ResNet-50在CIFAR-10上准确率提升1.16个百分点。

Conclusion: FMCE-Net++能有效提升现有模型性能，无需修改架构或增加数据。

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) face interpretability challenges due to their
opaque internal representations. While Feature Map Convergence Evaluation
(FMCE) quantifies module-level convergence via Feature Map Convergence Scores
(FMCS), it lacks experimental validation and closed-loop integration. To
address this limitation, we propose FMCE-Net++, a novel training framework that
integrates a pretrained, frozen FMCE-Net as an auxiliary head. This module
generates FMCS predictions, which, combined with task labels, jointly supervise
backbone optimization through a Representation Auxiliary Loss. The RAL
dynamically balances the primary classification loss and feature convergence
optimization via a tunable \Representation Abstraction Factor. Extensive
experiments conducted on MNIST, CIFAR-10, FashionMNIST, and CIFAR-100
demonstrate that FMCE-Net++ consistently enhances model performance without
architectural modifications or additional data. Key experimental outcomes
include accuracy gains of $+1.16$ pp (ResNet-50/CIFAR-10) and $+1.08$ pp
(ShuffleNet v2/CIFAR-100), validating that FMCE-Net++ can effectively elevate
state-of-the-art performance ceilings.

Motivation: 开放词汇语义分割面临语义类别广泛且细粒度的挑战，现有弱监督方法因依赖类别特定监督和不适合的特征构建方法导致性能不佳。

Method: SynSeg采用MCCL策略结合FSS框架，通过类别内外对齐和分离以及特征重构提升模型性能。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，SynSeg表现优于现有方法，如VOC上准确率提升4.5%。

Conclusion: SynSeg通过改进的对比学习和特征重构，显著提升了弱监督下的语义定位和区分能力。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation in open-vocabulary scenarios presents significant
challenges due to the wide range and granularity of semantic categories.
Existing weakly-supervised methods often rely on category-specific supervision
and ill-suited feature construction methods for contrastive learning, leading
to semantic misalignment and poor performance. In this work, we propose a novel
weakly-supervised approach, SynSeg, to address the challenges. SynSeg performs
Multi-Category Contrastive Learning (MCCL) as a stronger training signal with a
new feature reconstruction framework named Feature Synergy Structure (FSS).
Specifically, MCCL strategy robustly combines both intra- and inter-category
alignment and separation in order to make the model learn the knowledge of
correlations from different categories within the same image. Moreover, FSS
reconstructs discriminative features for contrastive learning through prior
fusion and semantic-activation-map enhancement, effectively avoiding the
foreground bias introduced by the visual encoder. In general, SynSeg
effectively improves the abilities in semantic localization and discrimination
under weak supervision. Extensive experiments on benchmarks demonstrate that
our method outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. For instance,
SynSeg achieves higher accuracy than SOTA baselines by 4.5\% on VOC, 8.9\% on
Context, 2.6\% on Object and 2.0\% on City.

Motivation: 解决复杂域偏移（如地理偏移）中传统无监督域适应方法的不足，利用语言模态的鲁棒性提升视觉模型适应性。

Result: 在经典（DomainNet）和复杂（GeoNet）域偏移上表现优于现有方法，达到新SOTA。

Conclusion: TRUST通过结合语言模态和视觉模型，有效提升了复杂域偏移下的适应性能。

Abstract: Recent unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods have shown great success
in addressing classical domain shifts (e.g., synthetic-to-real), but they still
suffer under complex shifts (e.g. geographical shift), where both the
background and object appearances differ significantly across domains. Prior
works showed that the language modality can help in the adaptation process,
exhibiting more robustness to such complex shifts. In this paper, we introduce
TRUST, a novel UDA approach that exploits the robustness of the language
modality to guide the adaptation of a vision model. TRUST generates
pseudo-labels for target samples from their captions and introduces a novel
uncertainty estimation strategy that uses normalised CLIP similarity scores to
estimate the uncertainty of the generated pseudo-labels. Such estimated
uncertainty is then used to reweight the classification loss, mitigating the
adverse effects of wrong pseudo-labels obtained from low-quality captions. To
further increase the robustness of the vision model, we propose a multimodal
soft-contrastive learning loss that aligns the vision and language feature
spaces, by leveraging captions to guide the contrastive training of the vision
model on target images. In our contrastive loss, each pair of images acts as
both a positive and a negative pair and their feature representations are
attracted and repulsed with a strength proportional to the similarity of their
captions. This solution avoids the need for hardly determining positive and
negative pairs, which is critical in the UDA setting. Our approach outperforms
previous methods, setting the new state-of-the-art on classical (DomainNet) and
complex (GeoNet) domain shifts. The code will be available upon acceptance.

Conclusion: CAE高效但缺乏物理可解释性，未来可开发物理信息增强的CAE版本。

Abstract: This study applied representation learning algorithms to satellite images and
evaluated the learned latent spaces with classifications of various weather
events. The algorithms investigated include the classical linear
transformation, i.e., principal component analysis (PCA), state-of-the-art deep
learning method, i.e., convolutional autoencoder (CAE), and a residual network
pre-trained with large image datasets (PT). The experiment results indicated
that the latent space learned by CAE consistently showed higher threat scores
for all classification tasks. The classifications with PCA yielded high hit
rates but also high false-alarm rates. In addition, the PT performed
exceptionally well at recognizing tropical cyclones but was inferior in other
tasks. Further experiments suggested that representations learned from
higher-resolution datasets are superior in all classification tasks for
deep-learning algorithms, i.e., CAE and PT. We also found that smaller latent
space sizes had minor impact on the classification task's hit rate. Still, a
latent space dimension smaller than 128 caused a significantly higher false
alarm rate. Though the CAE can learn latent spaces effectively and efficiently,
the interpretation of the learned representation lacks direct connections to
physical attributions. Therefore, developing a physics-informed version of CAE
can be a promising outlook for the current work.

Abstract: Urbanization, climate change, and agricultural stress are increasing the
demand for precise and timely environmental monitoring. Land Surface
Temperature (LST) is a key variable in this context and is retrieved from
remote sensing satellites. However, these systems face a trade-off between
spatial and temporal resolution. While spatio-temporal fusion methods offer
promising solutions, few have addressed the estimation of daily LST at 10 m
resolution. In this study, we present WGAST, a Weakly-Supervised Generative
Network for Daily 10 m LST Estimation via Spatio-Temporal Fusion of Terra
MODIS, Landsat 8, and Sentinel-2. WGAST is the first end-to-end deep learning
framework designed for this task. It adopts a conditional generative
adversarial architecture, with a generator composed of four stages: feature
extraction, fusion, LST reconstruction, and noise suppression. The first stage
employs a set of encoders to extract multi-level latent representations from
the inputs, which are then fused in the second stage using cosine similarity,
normalization, and temporal attention mechanisms. The third stage decodes the
fused features into high-resolution LST, followed by a Gaussian filter to
suppress high-frequency noise. Training follows a weakly supervised strategy
based on physical averaging principles and reinforced by a PatchGAN
discriminator. Experiments demonstrate that WGAST outperforms existing methods
in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations. Compared to the
best-performing baseline, on average, WGAST reduces RMSE by 17.18% and improves
SSIM by 11.00%. Furthermore, WGAST is robust to cloud-induced LST and
effectively captures fine-scale thermal patterns, as validated against 33
ground-based sensors. The code is available at

Result: 实验表明，SC-Captioner能生成更优的字幕，显著优于直接偏好优化策略。

Conclusion: SC-Captioner通过强化学习和精细奖励设计，有效提升了图像字幕的生成质量。

Abstract: We propose SC-Captioner, a reinforcement learning framework that enables the
self-correcting capability of image caption models. Our crucial technique lies
in the design of the reward function to incentivize accurate caption
corrections. Specifically, the predicted and reference captions are decomposed
into object, attribute, and relation sets using scene-graph parsing algorithms.
We calculate the set difference between sets of initial and self-corrected
captions to identify added and removed elements. These elements are matched
against the reference sets to calculate correctness bonuses for accurate
refinements and mistake punishments for wrong additions and removals, thereby
forming the final reward. For image caption quality assessment, we propose a
set of metrics refined from CAPTURE that alleviate its incomplete precision
evaluation and inefficient relation matching problems. Furthermore, we collect
a fine-grained annotated image caption dataset, RefinedCaps, consisting of 6.5K
diverse images from COCO dataset. Experiments show that applying SC-Captioner
on large visual-language models can generate better image captions across
various scenarios, significantly outperforming the direct preference
optimization training strategy.

*Yi Qin,Rui Wang,Tao Huang,Tong Xiao,Liping Jing*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VeSCA是一种针对Segment Anything Model（SAM）的新型对抗攻击方法，通过编码器生成可迁移的对抗样本，性能提升12.7%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM的零样本能力虽强，但其固有漏洞可能导致下游应用失败，因此需主动评估这些漏洞。

Method: VeSCA利用SAM的编码器，通过参数化单纯复形和顶点细化迭代，生成可迁移的对抗样本。

Result: 实验表明，VeSCA在五个领域数据集上性能提升12.7%。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了SAM漏洞对下游模型的风险，呼吁开发更鲁棒的基础模型。

Abstract: While the Segment Anything Model (SAM) transforms interactive segmentation
with zero-shot abilities, its inherent vulnerabilities present a single-point
risk, potentially leading to the failure of numerous downstream applications.
Proactively evaluating these transferable vulnerabilities is thus imperative.
Prior adversarial attacks on SAM often present limited transferability due to
insufficient exploration of common weakness across domains. To address this, we
propose Vertex-Refining Simplicial Complex Attack (VeSCA), a novel method that
leverages only the encoder of SAM for generating transferable adversarial
examples. Specifically, it achieves this by explicitly characterizing the
shared vulnerable regions between SAM and downstream models through a
parametric simplicial complex. Our goal is to identify such complexes within
adversarially potent regions by iterative vertex-wise refinement. A lightweight
domain re-adaptation strategy is introduced to bridge domain divergence using
minimal reference data during the initialization of simplicial complex.
Ultimately, VeSCA generates consistently transferable adversarial examples
through random simplicial complex sampling. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that VeSCA achieves performance improved by 12.7% compared to state-of-the-art
methods across three downstream model categories across five domain-specific
datasets. Our findings further highlight the downstream model risks posed by
SAM's vulnerabilities and emphasize the urgency of developing more robust
foundation models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于显式3D眼球结构的新型3D视线重定向框架，通过3D高斯泼溅（3DGS）实现眼球旋转和平移，生成高质量图像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于神经辐射场（NeRF）的视线重定向方法未显式建模3D表示的运动，缺乏对眼球结构的精确控制。

Method: 采用3D高斯泼溅（3DGS）显式表示眼球结构，并引入自适应变形模块模拟眼部肌肉细微运动。

Result: 在ETH-XGaze数据集上验证，生成图像质量和视线估计精度优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 显式3D眼球结构结合自适应变形模块显著提升了视线重定向的逼真度和准确性。

Abstract: We propose a novel 3D gaze redirection framework that leverages an explicit
3D eyeball structure. Existing gaze redirection methods are typically based on
neural radiance fields, which employ implicit neural representations via volume
rendering. Unlike these NeRF-based approaches, where the rotation and
translation of 3D representations are not explicitly modeled, we introduce a
dedicated 3D eyeball structure to represent the eyeballs with 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS). Our method generates photorealistic images that faithfully
reproduce the desired gaze direction by explicitly rotating and translating the
3D eyeball structure. In addition, we propose an adaptive deformation module
that enables the replication of subtle muscle movements around the eyes.
Through experiments conducted on the ETH-XGaze dataset, we demonstrate that our
framework is capable of generating diverse novel gaze images, achieving
superior image quality and gaze estimation accuracy compared to previous
state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于扩散模型的方法，结合稀疏IMU和单目摄像头进行实时人体运动捕捉，通过融合两种信号模态提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在视觉信息偶尔不可用（如遮挡或离开视野）时，如何利用IMU的稳定性和视觉信息的整体性来提升运动捕捉的鲁棒性和准确性。

Method: 将视觉信息整体转化为条件嵌入，同时将IMU测量与噪声姿态逐帧拼接作为扩散模型的输入，充分利用两种信号的特点。

Result: 实验证明该方法在姿态估计上具有先进性能，优于之前的工作。

Conclusion: 该方法通过巧妙融合视觉和IMU信号，实现了鲁棒且高效的实时人体运动捕捉。

Abstract: Combining sparse IMUs and a monocular camera is a new promising setting to
perform real-time human motion capture. This paper proposes a diffusion-based
solution to learn human motion priors and fuse the two modalities of signals
together seamlessly in a unified framework. By delicately considering the
characteristics of the two signals, the sequential visual information is
considered as a whole and transformed into a condition embedding, while the
inertial measurement is concatenated with the noisy body pose frame by frame to
construct a sequential input for the diffusion model. Firstly, we observe that
the visual information may be unavailable in some frames due to occlusions or
subjects moving out of the camera view. Thus incorporating the sequential
visual features as a whole to get a single feature embedding is robust to the
occasional degenerations of visual information in those frames. On the other
hand, the IMU measurements are robust to occlusions and always stable when
signal transmission has no problem. So incorporating them frame-wisely could
better explore the temporal information for the system. Experiments have
demonstrated the effectiveness of the system design and its state-of-the-art
performance in pose estimation compared with the previous works. Our codes are

TL;DR: SDEval是一个动态安全评估框架，通过调整安全基准的分布和复杂性来解决多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的安全问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着MLLMs的快速发展，现有安全数据集可能过时且易受数据污染影响，需要动态评估框架。

Method: SDEval采用文本、图像和文本-图像动态策略生成新样本，分析其对模型安全的影响。

Result: 实验表明SDEval显著影响安全评估，减轻数据污染，并暴露MLLMs的安全限制。

Conclusion: SDEval是一个通用框架，适用于现有安全和能力基准，有效提升评估动态性和准确性。

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving landscape of Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs), the safety concerns of their outputs have earned significant
attention. Although numerous datasets have been proposed, they may become
outdated with MLLM advancements and are susceptible to data contamination
issues. To address these problems, we propose \textbf{SDEval}, the
\textit{first} safety dynamic evaluation framework to controllably adjust the
distribution and complexity of safety benchmarks. Specifically, SDEval mainly
adopts three dynamic strategies: text, image, and text-image dynamics to
generate new samples from original benchmarks. We first explore the individual
effects of text and image dynamics on model safety. Then, we find that
injecting text dynamics into images can further impact safety, and conversely,
injecting image dynamics into text also leads to safety risks. SDEval is
general enough to be applied to various existing safety and even capability
benchmarks. Experiments across safety benchmarks, MLLMGuard and VLSBench, and
capability benchmarks, MMBench and MMVet, show that SDEval significantly
influences safety evaluation, mitigates data contamination, and exposes safety
limitations of MLLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/hq-King/SDEval

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal vision models have highlighted limitations
in late-stage feature fusion and suboptimal query selection for hybrid prompts
open-world segmentation, alongside constraints from caption-derived
vocabularies. To address these challenges, we propose Prompt-DINO, a
text-guided visual Prompt DINO framework featuring three key innovations.
First, we introduce an early fusion mechanism that unifies text/visual prompts
and backbone features at the initial encoding stage, enabling deeper
cross-modal interactions to resolve semantic ambiguities. Second, we design
order-aligned query selection for DETR-based architectures, explicitly
optimizing the structural alignment between text and visual queries during
decoding to enhance semantic-spatial consistency. Third, we develop a
generative data engine powered by the Recognize Anything via Prompting (RAP)
model, which synthesizes 0.5B diverse training instances through a dual-path
cross-verification pipeline, reducing label noise by 80.5% compared to
conventional approaches. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Prompt-DINO
achieves state-of-the-art performance on open-world detection benchmarks while
significantly expanding semantic coverage beyond fixed-vocabulary constraints.
Our work establishes a new paradigm for scalable multimodal detection and data
generation in open-world scenarios. Data&Code are available at

Motivation: 现有的多光谱和全色图像融合方法主要依赖标准卷积，缺乏对自适应卷积的探索，而后者能更好地利用遥感图像的像素相关性。

Method: 提出DSConv方法，动态分割卷积核并结合注意力机制，选择感兴趣位置，将原始卷积核分割为多个小核，以增强特征提取能力。

Result: 实验证明DSConv在多光谱和全色图像融合任务中表现出色，达到了先进水平。

Conclusion: DSConv通过动态分割卷积核和注意力机制，显著提升了图像融合的效果，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Aiming to obtain a high-resolution image, pansharpening involves the fusion
of a multi-spectral image (MS) and a panchromatic image (PAN), the low-level
vision task remaining significant and challenging in contemporary research.
Most existing approaches rely predominantly on standard convolutions, few
making the effort to adaptive convolutions, which are effective owing to the
inter-pixel correlations of remote sensing images. In this paper, we propose a
novel strategy for dynamically splitting convolution kernels in conjunction
with attention, selecting positions of interest, and splitting the original
convolution kernel into multiple smaller kernels, named DSConv. The proposed
DSConv more effectively extracts features of different positions within the
receptive field, enhancing the network's generalization, optimization, and
feature representation capabilities. Furthermore, we innovate and enrich
concepts of dynamic splitting convolution and provide a novel network
architecture for pansharpening capable of achieving the tasks more efficiently,
building upon this methodology. Adequate fair experiments illustrate the
effectiveness and the state-of-the-art performance attained by
DSConv.Comprehensive and rigorous discussions proved the superiority and
optimal usage conditions of DSConv.

TL;DR: VISTAR是一个用户中心的多维度文本到图像（T2I）评估基准，结合确定性指标和新型HWPQ方案，显著提升评估准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有T2I评估指标的局限性，提供更全面、用户导向的评估方法。

Method: 采用两层级混合范式：确定性指标量化物理属性，HWPQ方案评估抽象语义。基于专家研究定义用户角色和评估角度。

Result: 指标与人类评估高度一致（>75%），HWPQ在抽象语义上达到85.9%准确率，显著优于基线。不同模型表现因角色权重而异。

Conclusion: VISTAR为T2I评估提供可复现、领域特定的指导，资源已公开。

Abstract: We present VISTAR, a user-centric, multi-dimensional benchmark for
text-to-image (T2I) evaluation that addresses the limitations of existing
metrics. VISTAR introduces a two-tier hybrid paradigm: it employs
deterministic, scriptable metrics for physically quantifiable attributes (e.g.,
text rendering, lighting) and a novel Hierarchical Weighted P/N Questioning
(HWPQ) scheme that uses constrained vision-language models to assess abstract
semantics (e.g., style fusion, cultural fidelity). Grounded in a Delphi study
with 120 experts, we defined seven user roles and nine evaluation angles to
construct the benchmark, which comprises 2,845 prompts validated by over 15,000
human pairwise comparisons. Our metrics achieve high human alignment (>75%),
with the HWPQ scheme reaching 85.9% accuracy on abstract semantics,
significantly outperforming VQA baselines. Comprehensive evaluation of
state-of-the-art models reveals no universal champion, as role-weighted scores
reorder rankings and provide actionable guidance for domain-specific
deployment. All resources are publicly released to foster reproducible T2I
assessment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AD的早期诊断依赖于精确捕捉脑部结构变化，现有深度学习方法因局限于单一平面和无法捕捉复杂非线性关系而效果有限。

Method: MPF-KANSC结合多平面融合（MPF）和KANSC注意力机制，并行提取多平面特征并精确识别病变区域。

Result: 在ADNI数据集上验证，MPF-KANSC表现优异，并发现AD进展中右脑皮层结构不对称的新证据。

Conclusion: MPF-KANSC显著提升了AD诊断的准确性和可解释性，为AD研究提供了新视角。

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that
severely impairs cognitive function and quality of life. Timely intervention in
AD relies heavily on early and precise diagnosis, which remains challenging due
to the complex and subtle structural changes in the brain. Most existing deep
learning methods focus only on a single plane of structural magnetic resonance
imaging (sMRI) and struggle to accurately capture the complex and nonlinear
relationships among pathological regions of the brain, thus limiting their
ability to precisely identify atrophic features. To overcome these limitations,
we propose an innovative framework, MPF-KANSC, which integrates multi-plane
fusion (MPF) for combining features from the coronal, sagittal, and axial
planes, and a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network-guided spatial-channel attention
mechanism (KANSC) to more effectively learn and represent sMRI atrophy
features. Specifically, the proposed model enables parallel feature extraction
from multiple anatomical planes, thus capturing more comprehensive structural
information. The KANSC attention mechanism further leverages a more flexible
and accurate nonlinear function approximation technique, facilitating precise
identification and localization of disease-related abnormalities. Experiments
on the ADNI dataset confirm that the proposed MPF-KANSC achieves superior
performance in AD diagnosis. Moreover, our findings provide new evidence of
right-lateralized asymmetry in subcortical structural changes during AD
progression, highlighting the model's promising interpretability.

Conclusion: PostDiff为扩散模型的高效部署提供了一种无需微调的解决方案，优化了效率与保真度的平衡。

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown remarkable success across generative tasks, yet
their high computational demands challenge deployment on resource-limited
platforms. This paper investigates a critical question for compute-optimal
diffusion model deployment: Under a post-training setting without fine-tuning,
is it more effective to reduce the number of denoising steps or to use a
cheaper per-step inference? Intuitively, reducing the number of denoising steps
increases the variability of the distributions across steps, making the model
more sensitive to compression. In contrast, keeping more denoising steps makes
the differences smaller, preserving redundancy, and making post-training
compression more feasible. To systematically examine this, we propose PostDiff,
a training-free framework for accelerating pre-trained diffusion models by
reducing redundancy at both the input level and module level in a post-training
manner. At the input level, we propose a mixed-resolution denoising scheme
based on the insight that reducing generation resolution in early denoising
steps can enhance low-frequency components and improve final generation
fidelity. At the module level, we employ a hybrid module caching strategy to
reuse computations across denoising steps. Extensive experiments and ablation
studies demonstrate that (1) PostDiff can significantly improve the
fidelity-efficiency trade-off of state-of-the-art diffusion models, and (2) to
boost efficiency while maintaining decent generation fidelity, reducing
per-step inference cost is often more effective than reducing the number of
denoising steps. Our code is available at

Conclusion: UW-3DGS通过物理建模和自适应剪枝显著提升了水下3D重建的质量和效率。

Abstract: Underwater 3D scene reconstruction faces severe challenges from light
absorption, scattering, and turbidity, which degrade geometry and color
fidelity in traditional methods like Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF). While NeRF
extensions such as SeaThru-NeRF incorporate physics-based models, their MLP
reliance limits efficiency and spatial resolution in hazy environments. We
introduce UW-3DGS, a novel framework adapting 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for
robust underwater reconstruction. Key innovations include: (1) a plug-and-play
learnable underwater image formation module using voxel-based regression for
spatially varying attenuation and backscatter; and (2) a Physics-Aware
Uncertainty Pruning (PAUP) branch that adaptively removes noisy floating
Gaussians via uncertainty scoring, ensuring artifact-free geometry. The
pipeline operates in training and rendering stages. During training, noisy
Gaussians are optimized end-to-end with underwater parameters, guided by PAUP
pruning and scattering modeling. In rendering, refined Gaussians produce clean
Unattenuated Radiance Images (URIs) free from media effects, while learned
physics enable realistic Underwater Images (UWIs) with accurate light
transport. Experiments on SeaThru-NeRF and UWBundle datasets show superior
performance, achieving PSNR of 27.604, SSIM of 0.868, and LPIPS of 0.104 on

Abstract: With the acceleration of urbanization, criminal behavior in public scenes
poses an increasingly serious threat to social security. Traditional anomaly
detection methods based on feature recognition struggle to capture high-level
behavioral semantics from historical information, while generative approaches
based on Large Language Models (LLMs) often fail to meet real-time
requirements. To address these challenges, we propose MA-CBP, a criminal
behavior prediction framework based on multi-agent asynchronous collaboration.
This framework transforms real-time video streams into frame-level semantic
descriptions, constructs causally consistent historical summaries, and fuses
adjacent image frames to perform joint reasoning over long- and short-term
contexts. The resulting behavioral decisions include key elements such as event
subjects, locations, and causes, enabling early warning of potential criminal
activity. In addition, we construct a high-quality criminal behavior dataset
that provides multi-scale language supervision, including frame-level,
summary-level, and event-level semantic annotations. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance on multiple datasets
and offers a promising solution for risk warning in urban public safety
scenarios.

Result: 在1622张胸水CT图像上验证，IoU和Dice分数分别达到80.1%和89.0%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DBIF-AUNet显著优化了复杂胸水CT图像的分割精度，为临床诊断提供了更高效的工具。

Abstract: Pleural effusion semantic segmentation can significantly enhance the accuracy
and timeliness of clinical diagnosis and treatment by precisely identifying
disease severity and lesion areas. Currently, semantic segmentation of pleural
effusion CT images faces multiple challenges. These include similar gray levels
between effusion and surrounding tissues, blurred edges, and variable
morphology. Existing methods often struggle with diverse image variations and
complex edges, primarily because direct feature concatenation causes semantic
gaps. To address these challenges, we propose the Dual-Branch Interactive
Fusion Attention model (DBIF-AUNet). This model constructs a densely nested
skip-connection network and innovatively refines the Dual-Domain Feature
Disentanglement module (DDFD). The DDFD module orthogonally decouples the
functions of dual-domain modules to achieve multi-scale feature complementarity
and enhance characteristics at different levels. Concurrently, we design a
Branch Interaction Attention Fusion module (BIAF) that works synergistically
with the DDFD. This module dynamically weights and fuses global, local, and
frequency band features, thereby improving segmentation robustness.
Furthermore, we implement a nested deep supervision mechanism with hierarchical
adaptive hybrid loss to effectively address class imbalance. Through validation
on 1,622 pleural effusion CT images from Southwest Hospital, DBIF-AUNet
achieved IoU and Dice scores of 80.1% and 89.0% respectively. These results
outperform state-of-the-art medical image segmentation models U-Net++ and
Swin-UNet by 5.7%/2.7% and 2.2%/1.5% respectively, demonstrating significant
optimization in segmentation accuracy for complex pleural effusion CT images.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通过为每个任务扩展整个层来缓解遗忘，但会导致参数冗余和可扩展性差。

Method: LiLoRA通过共享LoRA矩阵A、对矩阵B进行低秩分解以减少任务特定参数，并引入余弦正则化稳定性损失来保持共享表示的一致性。

Result: 实验表明，LiLoRA在连续任务学习中表现优异，同时显著提高了参数效率。

Conclusion: LiLoRA为CVIT提供了一种高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Continual Visual Instruction Tuning (CVIT) enables Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) to incrementally learn new tasks over time. However, this
process is challenged by catastrophic forgetting, where performance on
previously learned tasks deteriorates as the model adapts to new ones. A common
approach to mitigate forgetting is architecture expansion, which introduces
task-specific modules to prevent interference. Yet, existing methods often
expand entire layers for each task, leading to significant parameter overhead
and poor scalability. To overcome these issues, we introduce LoRA in LoRA
(LiLoRA), a highly efficient architecture expansion method tailored for CVIT in
MLLMs. LiLoRA shares the LoRA matrix A across tasks to reduce redundancy,
applies an additional low-rank decomposition to matrix B to minimize
task-specific parameters, and incorporates a cosine-regularized stability loss
to preserve consistency in shared representations over time. Extensive
experiments on a diverse CVIT benchmark show that LiLoRA consistently achieves
superior performance in sequential task learning while significantly improving
parameter efficiency compared to existing approaches.

*Zhaopeng Gu,Bingke Zhu,Guibo Zhu,Yingying Chen,Wei Ge,Ming Tang,Jinqiao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AnomalyMoE是一种基于混合专家架构的通用异常检测框架，通过分解异常检测问题为三个语义层次，显著提升了跨领域的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有异常检测方法通常针对特定领域，泛化能力有限，需要一种通用框架来解决多领域异常检测问题。

Method: AnomalyMoE采用混合专家架构，包含三个专家网络分别处理局部、组件和全局异常，并引入EIR和ESB模块提升专家多样性和利用率。

Result: 在8个挑战性数据集上，AnomalyMoE显著优于领域专用方法，达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: AnomalyMoE通过分层设计和专家优化模块，实现了通用且高效的异常检测。

Abstract: Anomaly detection is a critical task across numerous domains and modalities,
yet existing methods are often highly specialized, limiting their
generalizability. These specialized models, tailored for specific anomaly types
like textural defects or logical errors, typically exhibit limited performance
when deployed outside their designated contexts. To overcome this limitation,
we propose AnomalyMoE, a novel and universal anomaly detection framework based
on a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture. Our key insight is to decompose the
complex anomaly detection problem into three distinct semantic hierarchies:
local structural anomalies, component-level semantic anomalies, and global
logical anomalies. AnomalyMoE correspondingly employs three dedicated expert
networks at the patch, component, and global levels, and is specialized in
reconstructing features and identifying deviations at its designated semantic
level. This hierarchical design allows a single model to concurrently
understand and detect a wide spectrum of anomalies. Furthermore, we introduce
an Expert Information Repulsion (EIR) module to promote expert diversity and an
Expert Selection Balancing (ESB) module to ensure the comprehensive utilization
of all experts. Experiments on 8 challenging datasets spanning industrial
imaging, 3D point clouds, medical imaging, video surveillance, and logical
anomaly detection demonstrate that AnomalyMoE establishes new state-of-the-art
performance, significantly outperforming specialized methods in their
respective domains.

TL;DR: PA-HOI数据集填补了现有HOI数据集中物理属性对人类长期运动影响的空白，包含562个运动序列，展示了物体物理属性对人类姿势、速度等的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有HOI数据集关注功能细节，忽略了物体物理属性对人类长期运动的影响，PA-HOI数据集旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 构建PA-HOI数据集，包含562个运动序列，由不同性别受试者与35个3D物体互动，物体在尺寸、形状和重量上多样化。

Result: 数据集显著扩展了对物体物理属性如何影响人类运动的理解，并验证了其与现有运动生成方法的兼容性。

Conclusion: PA-HOI数据集为理解物体物理属性对人类运动的影响提供了新资源，并展示了其在运动生成中的实用性。

Abstract: The Human-Object Interaction (HOI) task explores the dynamic interactions
between humans and objects in physical environments, providing essential
biomechanical and cognitive-behavioral foundations for fields such as robotics,
virtual reality, and human-computer interaction. However, existing HOI data
sets focus on details of affordance, often neglecting the influence of physical
properties of objects on human long-term motion. To bridge this gap, we
introduce the PA-HOI Motion Capture dataset, which highlights the impact of
objects' physical attributes on human motion dynamics, including human posture,
moving velocity, and other motion characteristics. The dataset comprises 562
motion sequences of human-object interactions, with each sequence performed by
subjects of different genders interacting with 35 3D objects that vary in size,
shape, and weight. This dataset stands out by significantly extending the scope
of existing ones for understanding how the physical attributes of different
objects influence human posture, speed, motion scale, and interacting
strategies. We further demonstrate the applicability of the PA-HOI dataset by
integrating it with existing motion generation methods, validating its capacity
to transfer realistic physical awareness.

*Zhiyan Bo,Laura C. Coates,Bartlomiej W. Papiez*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于双X光片的可解释性图像级SvdH评分预测的两阶段流程，通过注意力机制和多实例学习提升预测准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SvdH评分在临床实践中因复杂性难以广泛应用，手动评分效率低下，需要自动化解决方案。

Method: 采用两阶段流程：提取疾病相关图像区域，并通过注意力机制的多实例学习整合特征进行预测。提出了两种区域提取方案。

Result: 最佳模型PCC达0.943，RMSE为15.73；集成学习后PCC提升至0.945，RMSE降至15.57，接近放射科医生水平。

Conclusion: 该流程能有效识别与RA进展相关的解剖结构，决策依据与临床医生一致，性能达到最新水平。

Abstract: The Sharp/van der Heijde (SvdH) score has been widely used in clinical trials
to quantify radiographic damage in Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), but its
complexity has limited its adoption in routine clinical practice. To address
the inefficiency of manual scoring, this work proposes a two-stage pipeline for
interpretable image-level SvdH score prediction using dual-hand radiographs.
Our approach extracts disease-relevant image regions and integrates them using
attention-based multiple instance learning to generate image-level features for
prediction. We propose two region extraction schemes: 1) sampling image tiles
most likely to contain abnormalities, and 2) cropping patches containing
disease-relevant joints. With Scheme 2, our best individual score prediction
model achieved a Pearson's correlation coefficient (PCC) of 0.943 and a root
mean squared error (RMSE) of 15.73. Ensemble learning further boosted
prediction accuracy, yielding a PCC of 0.945 and RMSE of 15.57, achieving
state-of-the-art performance that is comparable to that of experienced
radiologists (PCC = 0.97, RMSE = 18.75). Finally, our pipeline effectively
identified and made decisions based on anatomical structures which clinicians
consider relevant to RA progression.

*Guoyu Zhou,Jing Zhang,Yi Yan,Hui Zhang,Li Zhuo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种纹理感知和边缘引导的Transformer（TEFormer），用于解决城市遥感图像语义分割中的纹理差异和边缘模糊问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 城市遥感图像中地物纹理差异小、空间结构相似，易导致语义模糊和误分类；同时，不规则形状、模糊边界和重叠分布增加了分割难度。

Method: 设计了纹理感知模块（TaM）捕获细粒度纹理差异，构建边缘引导三分支解码器（Eg3Head）保留局部边缘细节，并通过边缘引导特征融合模块（EgFFM）融合上下文与边缘信息。

Result: 在Potsdam、Vaihingen和LoveDA数据集上分别达到88.57%、81.46%和53.55%的mIoU。

Conclusion: TEFormer有效提升了城市遥感图像的语义分割精度。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of urban remote sensing images (URSIs) is crucial for
applications such as urban planning and environmental monitoring. However,
geospatial objects often exhibit subtle texture differences and similar spatial
structures, which can easily lead to semantic ambiguity and misclassification.
Moreover, challenges such as irregular object shapes, blurred boundaries, and
overlapping spatial distributions of semantic objects contribute to complex and
diverse edge morphologies, further complicating accurate segmentation. To
tackle these issues, we propose a texture-aware and edge-guided Transformer
(TEFormer) that integrates texture awareness and edge-guidance mechanisms for
semantic segmentation of URSIs. In the encoder, a texture-aware module (TaM) is
designed to capture fine-grained texture differences between visually similar
categories to enhance semantic discrimination. Then, an edge-guided tri-branch
decoder (Eg3Head) is constructed to preserve local edges and details for
multiscale context-awareness. Finally, an edge-guided feature fusion module
(EgFFM) is to fuse contextual and detail information with edge information to
realize refined semantic segmentation. Extensive experiments show that TEFormer
achieves mIoU of 88.57%, 81.46%, and 53.55% on the Potsdam, Vaihingen, and
LoveDA datasets, respectively, shows the effectiveness in URSI semantic
segmentation.

*Daniel Feijoo,Paula Garrido-Mellado,Jaesung Rim,Alvaro Garcia,Marcos V. Conde*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种通用的图像去模糊方法，能够处理多种模糊类型，无需针对每种模糊单独训练模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法针对特定模糊类型设计，缺乏通用性，需要多个模型覆盖不同模糊场景，不切实际。

Method: 采用混合专家（MoE）解码模块，根据识别的模糊类型动态路由图像特征，实现端到端的精确恢复。

Result: 统一方法性能与专用模型相当，且在未见过的模糊场景中表现出优异的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法为图像去模糊提供了一种高效、通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Image deblurring, removing blurring artifacts from images, is a fundamental
task in computational photography and low-level computer vision. Existing
approaches focus on specialized solutions tailored to particular blur types,
thus, these solutions lack generalization. This limitation in current methods
implies requiring multiple models to cover several blur types, which is not
practical in many real scenarios. In this paper, we introduce the first
all-in-one deblurring method capable of efficiently restoring images affected
by diverse blur degradations, including global motion, local motion, blur in
low-light conditions, and defocus blur. We propose a mixture-of-experts (MoE)
decoding module, which dynamically routes image features based on the
recognized blur degradation, enabling precise and efficient restoration in an
end-to-end manner. Our unified approach not only achieves performance
comparable to dedicated task-specific models, but also demonstrates remarkable
robustness and generalization capabilities on unseen blur degradation
scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LNCLIP-DF通过微调CLIP视觉编码器的Layer Normalization参数（仅0.03%），实现了对未见过的深度伪造技术的鲁棒泛化，并在13个基准数据集上达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度伪造检测器对未见技术的泛化问题，避免复杂架构设计。

Method: 仅微调Layer Normalization参数，结合L2归一化和潜在空间增强，构建超球面特征流形。

Result: 在13个数据集上表现优异，超越复杂方法，发现配对真实-伪造数据和多样化训练集对泛化至关重要。

Conclusion: 通过最小化修改预训练CLIP模型，实现了高效且可复现的SOTA泛化性能。

Abstract: The generalization of deepfake detectors to unseen manipulation techniques
remains a challenge for practical deployment. Although many approaches adapt
foundation models by introducing significant architectural complexity, this
work demonstrates that robust generalization is achievable through a
parameter-efficient adaptation of a pre-trained CLIP vision encoder. The
proposed method, LNCLIP-DF, fine-tunes only the Layer Normalization parameters
(0.03% of the total) and enhances generalization by enforcing a hyperspherical
feature manifold using L2 normalization and latent space augmentations.
  We conducted an extensive evaluation on 13 benchmark datasets spanning from
2019 to 2025. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance,
outperforming more complex, recent approaches in average cross-dataset AUROC.
Our analysis yields two primary findings for the field: 1) training on paired
real-fake data from the same source video is essential for mitigating shortcut
learning and improving generalization, and 2) detection difficulty on academic
datasets has not strictly increased over time, with models trained on older,
diverse datasets showing strong generalization capabilities.
  This work delivers a computationally efficient and reproducible method,
proving that state-of-the-art generalization is attainable by making targeted,
minimal changes to a pre-trained CLIP model. The code will be made publicly
available upon acceptance.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为FedX的新策略，通过解释引导的剪枝减少联邦学习中的通信开销，同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习在遥感图像分类任务中因隐私限制无法集中数据，但通信开销大是主要挑战。

Method: 利用反向传播解释方法估计模型组件的重要性，剪枝最不相关的部分以减少传输模型大小。

Result: 在BigEarthNet-S2和EuroSAT数据集上验证，FedX显著减少共享参数数量并提升模型泛化能力。

Conclusion: FedX有效降低通信开销，优于未剪枝模型和现有剪枝方法。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables the collaborative training of deep neural
networks across decentralized data archives (i.e., clients), where each client
stores data locally and only shares model updates with a central server. This
makes FL a suitable learning paradigm for remote sensing (RS) image
classification tasks, where data centralization may be restricted due to legal
and privacy constraints. However, a key challenge in applying FL to RS tasks is
the communication overhead caused by the frequent exchange of large model
updates between clients and the central server. To address this issue, in this
paper we propose a novel strategy (denoted as FedX) that uses
explanation-guided pruning to reduce communication overhead by minimizing the
size of the transmitted models without compromising performance. FedX leverages
backpropagation-based explanation methods to estimate the task-specific
importance of model components and prunes the least relevant ones at the
central server. The resulting sparse global model is then sent to clients,
substantially reducing communication overhead. We evaluate FedX on multi-label
scene classification using the BigEarthNet-S2 dataset and single-label scene
classification using the EuroSAT dataset. Experimental results show the success
of FedX in significantly reducing the number of shared model parameters while
enhancing the generalization capability of the global model, compared to both
unpruned model and state-of-the-art pruning methods. The code of FedX will be
available at https://git.tu-berlin.de/rsim/FedX.

Conclusion: XAG-Net是一种高效且准确的股骨MRI分割框架，CSA和AG模块对其性能至关重要。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of femur structures from Magnetic Resonance Imaging
(MRI) is critical for orthopedic diagnosis and surgical planning but remains
challenging due to the limitations of existing 2D and 3D deep learning-based
segmentation approaches. In this study, we propose XAG-Net, a novel 2.5D
U-Net-based architecture that incorporates pixel-wise cross-slice attention
(CSA) and skip attention gating (AG) mechanisms to enhance inter-slice
contextual modeling and intra-slice feature refinement. Unlike previous
CSA-based models, XAG-Net applies pixel-wise softmax attention across adjacent
slices at each spatial location for fine-grained inter-slice modeling.
Extensive evaluations demonstrate that XAG-Net surpasses baseline 2D, 2.5D, and
3D U-Net models in femur segmentation accuracy while maintaining computational
efficiency. Ablation studies further validate the critical role of the CSA and
AG modules, establishing XAG-Net as a promising framework for efficient and
accurate femur MRI segmentation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型在复杂视觉任务（如空间理解和细粒度感知）中表现不足，缺乏利用空间线索进行注意力校正的能力。

Method: 提出SIFThinker框架，采用反向扩展前向推理策略生成图像-文本链，并构建SIF-50K数据集；引入GRPO-SIF训练范式，整合深度信息进行视觉定位。

Result: 实验表明，SIFThinker在空间理解和细粒度视觉感知任务中优于现有方法，同时保持通用能力。

Conclusion: SIFThinker通过动态校正和聚焦提示相关区域，显著提升了复杂视觉任务的性能。

Abstract: Current multimodal large language models (MLLMs) still face significant
challenges in complex visual tasks (e.g., spatial understanding, fine-grained
perception). Prior methods have tried to incorporate visual reasoning, however,
they fail to leverage attention correction with spatial cues to iteratively
refine their focus on prompt-relevant regions. In this paper, we introduce
SIFThinker, a spatially-aware "think-with-images" framework that mimics human
visual perception. Specifically, SIFThinker enables attention correcting and
image region focusing by interleaving depth-enhanced bounding boxes and natural
language. Our contributions are twofold: First, we introduce a
reverse-expansion-forward-inference strategy that facilitates the generation of
interleaved image-text chains of thought for process-level supervision, which
in turn leads to the construction of the SIF-50K dataset. Besides, we propose
GRPO-SIF, a reinforced training paradigm that integrates depth-informed visual
grounding into a unified reasoning pipeline, teaching the model to dynamically
correct and focus on prompt-relevant regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that SIFThinker outperforms state-of-the-art methods in spatial understanding
and fine-grained visual perception, while maintaining strong general
capabilities, highlighting the effectiveness of our method.

TL;DR: 提出了一种数据高效的跨域视频时间定位方法URPA，无需目标域标注，通过少量未标注视频实现实时部署。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法GRPO依赖标注数据且计算开销大，难以在未标注域和实时场景中应用。

Method: 使用不确定性量化的Rollout策略适应（URPA），通过GRPO生成伪标签并估计置信度，加权训练奖励。

Result: 在三个数据集和六种跨域设置中，URPA仅需少量未标注视频即可实现良好泛化。

Conclusion: URPA解决了跨域视频时间定位的标注和计算开销问题，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Video Temporal Grounding (TG) aims to temporally locate video segments
matching a natural language description (a query) in a long video. While
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are effective at holistic semantic matching, they
often struggle with fine-grained temporal localisation. Recently, Group
Relative Policy Optimisation (GRPO) reformulates the inference process as a
reinforcement learning task, enabling fine-grained grounding and achieving
strong in-domain performance. However, GRPO relies on labelled data, making it
unsuitable in unlabelled domains. Moreover, because videos are large and
expensive to store and process, performing full-scale adaptation introduces
prohibitive latency and computational overhead, making it impractical for
real-time deployment. To overcome both problems, we introduce a Data-Efficient
Unlabelled Cross-domain Temporal Grounding method, from which a model is first
trained on a labelled source domain, then adapted to a target domain using only
a small number of unlabelled videos from the target domain. This approach
eliminates the need for target annotation and keeps both computational and
storage overhead low enough to run in real time. Specifically, we introduce.
Uncertainty-quantified Rollout Policy Adaptation (URPA) for cross-domain
knowledge transfer in learning video temporal grounding without target labels.
URPA generates multiple candidate predictions using GRPO rollouts, averages
them to form a pseudo label, and estimates confidence from the variance across
these rollouts. This confidence then weights the training rewards, guiding the
model to focus on reliable supervision. Experiments on three datasets across
six cross-domain settings show that URPA generalises well using only a few
unlabelled target videos. Codes will be released once published.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有弱监督视频异常检测模型难以处理复杂异常事件，因共享模型忽视类别特异性且弱监督信号缺乏时序信息。

Method: 提出GS-MoE框架，使用多个专家模型分别捕捉特定异常类型，并通过时序高斯分布损失增强监督信号。

Result: 在UCF-Crime、XD-Violence和MSAD数据集上取得91.58% AUC，性能领先。

Conclusion: GS-MoE通过类别特异性专家和时序指导，为弱监督视频异常检测设定了新基准。

Abstract: Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) is a challenging task due to the variability of
anomalous events and the limited availability of labeled data. Under the
Weakly-Supervised VAD (WSVAD) paradigm, only video-level labels are provided
during training, while predictions are made at the frame level. Although
state-of-the-art models perform well on simple anomalies (e.g., explosions),
they struggle with complex real-world events (e.g., shoplifting). This
difficulty stems from two key issues: (1) the inability of current models to
address the diversity of anomaly types, as they process all categories with a
shared model, overlooking category-specific features; and (2) the weak
supervision signal, which lacks precise temporal information, limiting the
ability to capture nuanced anomalous patterns blended with normal events. To
address these challenges, we propose Gaussian Splatting-guided Mixture of
Experts (GS-MoE), a novel framework that employs a set of expert models, each
specialized in capturing specific anomaly types. These experts are guided by a
temporal Gaussian splatting loss, enabling the model to leverage temporal
consistency and enhance weak supervision. The Gaussian splatting approach
encourages a more precise and comprehensive representation of anomalies by
focusing on temporal segments most likely to contain abnormal events. The
predictions from these specialized experts are integrated through a
mixture-of-experts mechanism to model complex relationships across diverse
anomaly patterns. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a
91.58% AUC on the UCF-Crime dataset, and demonstrates superior results on
XD-Violence and MSAD datasets. By leveraging category-specific expertise and
temporal guidance, GS-MoE sets a new benchmark for VAD under weak supervision.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心脏MR图像因设备和协议差异导致域偏移，限制了AI模型在实际场景中的应用。传统方法如数据增强或迁移学习存在局限性。

Method: 使用扩散模型生成合成心脏MR图像，保持结构和空间一致性，并用于训练域不变分割模型或域适应。

Result: 在多中心心脏MR分割任务中，合成数据显著提升了分割性能（p < 0.01）。

Conclusion: 该方法无需迁移学习或在线训练，有效解决了域偏移问题，特别适用于数据稀缺场景。

Abstract: Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, including cardiac MR, is prone to domain
shift due to variations in imaging devices and acquisition protocols. This
challenge limits the deployment of trained AI models in real-world scenarios,
where performance degrades on unseen domains. Traditional solutions involve
increasing the size of the dataset through ad-hoc image augmentation or
additional online training/transfer learning, which have several limitations.
Synthetic data offers a promising alternative, but anatomical/structural
consistency constraints limit the effectiveness of generative models in
creating image-label pairs. To address this, we propose a diffusion model (DM)
trained on a source domain that generates synthetic cardiac MR images that
resemble a given reference. The synthetic data maintains spatial and structural
fidelity, ensuring similarity to the source domain and compatibility with the
segmentation mask. We assess the utility of our generative approach in
multi-centre cardiac MR segmentation, using the 2D nnU-Net, 3D nnU-Net and
vanilla U-Net segmentation networks. We explore domain generalisation, where,
domain-invariant segmentation models are trained on synthetic source domain
data, and domain adaptation, where, we shift target domain data towards the
source domain using the DM. Both strategies significantly improved segmentation
performance on data from an unseen target domain, in terms of surface-based
metrics (Welch's t-test, p < 0.01), compared to training segmentation models on
real data alone. The proposed method ameliorates the need for transfer learning
or online training to address domain shift challenges in cardiac MR image
analysis, especially useful in data-scarce settings.

Motivation: 解决ViPro模型因依赖初始真实状态而无法在噪声环境下有效预测的问题。

Result: 改进后的模型能够在无监督情况下正确推断状态，且适用于更复杂的3D场景。

Conclusion: 改进后的ViPro模型在无监督状态下更鲁棒，适用于现实世界的复杂动态场景。

Abstract: Predicting future video frames is a challenging task with many downstream
applications. Previous work has shown that procedural knowledge enables deep
models for complex dynamical settings, however their model ViPro assumed a
given ground truth initial symbolic state. We show that this approach led to
the model learning a shortcut that does not actually connect the observed
environment with the predicted symbolic state, resulting in the inability to
estimate states given an observation if previous states are noisy. In this
work, we add several improvements to ViPro that enables the model to correctly
infer states from observations without providing a full ground truth state in
the beginning. We show that this is possible in an unsupervised manner, and
extend the original Orbits dataset with a 3D variant to close the gap to real
world scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多关注行人数量而非社会互动质量，本研究旨在通过街景图像提取潜在社会信息，验证其与城市规划和居民归属感的关系。

Method: 分析15个城市的2,998张街景图像，采用多模态大语言模型结合Mehta的社会互动分类（被动、短暂、持久），并通过线性回归模型控制天气、时间等因素。

Result: 天空视野指数与三种社会互动类型相关，绿化视野指数预测持久互动，居民归属感与短暂互动正相关。

Conclusion: 街景图像可作为量化社会互动的工具，支持跨文化理论验证和城市设计，未来或成为隐私保护的研究手段。

Abstract: Designing socially active streets has long been a goal of urban planning, yet
existing quantitative research largely measures pedestrian volume rather than
the quality of social interactions. We hypothesize that street view imagery --
an inexpensive data source with global coverage -- contains latent social
information that can be extracted and interpreted through established social
science theory. As a proof of concept, we analyzed 2,998 street view images
from 15 cities using a multimodal large language model guided by Mehta's
taxonomy of passive, fleeting, and enduring sociability -- one illustrative
example of a theory grounded in urban design that could be substituted or
complemented by other sociological frameworks. We then used linear regression
models, controlling for factors like weather, time of day, and pedestrian
counts, to test whether the inferred sociability measures correlate with
city-level place attachment scores from the World Values Survey and with
environmental predictors (e.g., green, sky, and water view indices) derived
from individual street view images. Results aligned with long-standing urban
planning theory: the sky view index was associated with all three sociability
types, the green view index predicted enduring sociability, and place
attachment was positively associated with fleeting sociability. These results
provide preliminary evidence that street view images can be used to infer
relationships between specific types of social interactions and built
environment variables. Further research could establish street view imagery as
a scalable, privacy-preserving tool for studying urban sociability, enabling
cross-cultural theory testing and evidence-based design of socially vibrant
cities.

Abstract: Understanding abnormal events in videos is a vital and challenging task that
has garnered significant attention in a wide range of applications. Although
current video understanding Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are
capable of analyzing general videos, they often struggle to handle anomalies
due to the spatial and temporal sparsity of abnormal events, where the
redundant information always leads to suboptimal outcomes. To address these
challenges, exploiting the representation and generalization capabilities of
Vison Language Models (VLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs), we propose
VA-GPT, a novel MLLM designed for summarizing and localizing abnormal events in
various videos. Our approach efficiently aligns effective tokens between visual
encoders and LLMs through two key proposed modules: Spatial Effective Token
Selection (SETS) and Temporal Effective Token Generation (TETG). These modules
enable our model to effectively capture and analyze both spatial and temporal
information associated with abnormal events, resulting in more accurate
responses and interactions. Furthermore, we construct an instruction-following
dataset specifically for fine-tuning video-anomaly-aware MLLMs, and introduce a
cross-domain evaluation benchmark based on XD-Violence dataset. Our proposed
method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on various benchmarks.

TL;DR: 本文实现了一种基于Goldstein、Bresson和Osher提出的两阶段图像分割算法，通过改进Chan-Vese能量模型，利用split Bregman方法高效实现图像分割。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图像分割是计算机视觉中的重要任务，传统Chan-Vese模型在效率上有改进空间。本文旨在通过改进能量模型和优化方法，实现更高效的两阶段分割。

Method: 改进Chan-Vese能量模型，引入split Bregman方法进行高效优化，实现图像的两阶段分割。

Result: 通过实验验证了该方法的有效性，展示了在不同参数下的分割性能。

Conclusion: 本文提出的方法在图像分割中表现出高效性和实用性，适用于两阶段分割任务。

Abstract: In this paper, we describe an implementation of the two-phase image
segmentation algorithm proposed by Goldstein, Bresson, Osher in
\cite{gold:bre}. This algorithm partitions the domain of a given 2d image into
foreground and background regions, and each pixel of the image is assigned
membership to one of these two regions. The underlying assumption for the
segmentation model is that the pixel values of the input image can be
summarized by two distinct average values, and that the region boundaries are
smooth. Accordingly, the model is defined as an energy in which the variable is
a region membership function to assign pixels to either region, originally
proposed by Chan and Vese in \cite{chan:vese}. This energy is the sum of image
data terms in the regions and a length penalty for region boundaries.
Goldstein, Bresson, Osher modify the energy of Chan-Vese in \cite{gold:bre} so
that their new energy can be minimized efficiently using the split Bregman
method to produce an equivalent two-phase segmentation. We provide a detailed
implementation of this method \cite{gold:bre}, and document its performance
with several images over a range of algorithm parameters.

Motivation: 解决一-to-多人脸识别中图库外（Out-of-gallery）检测的问题，减少误识别和调查时间浪费。

Method: 利用排名第一身份的额外注册图像生成训练数据，训练分类器预测图库内/外状态。

Result: 实验证明方法对多种图像质量有效，且在人口统计学上表现一致。

Conclusion: 该方法可减少误识别，且仅在使用先进损失函数训练的匹配器上有效。

Abstract: A central problem in one-to-many facial identification is that the person in
the probe image may or may not have enrolled image(s) in the gallery; that is,
may be In-gallery or Out-of-gallery. Past approaches to detect when a rank-one
result is Out-of-gallery have mostly focused on finding a suitable threshold on
the similarity score. We take a new approach, using the additional enrolled
images of the identity with the rank-one result to predict if the rank-one
result is In-gallery / Out-of-gallery. Given a gallery of identities and
images, we generate In-gallery and Out-of-gallery training data by extracting
the ranks of additional enrolled images corresponding to the rank-one identity.
We then train a classifier to utilize this feature vector to predict whether a
rank-one result is In-gallery or Out-of-gallery. Using two different datasets
and four different matchers, we present experimental results showing that our
approach is viable for mugshot quality probe images, and also, importantly, for
probes degraded by blur, reduced resolution, atmospheric turbulence and
sunglasses. We also analyze results across demographic groups, and show that
In-gallery / Out-of-gallery classification accuracy is similar across
demographics. Our approach has the potential to provide an objective estimate
of whether a one-to-many facial identification is Out-of-gallery, and thereby
to reduce false positive identifications, wrongful arrests, and wasted
investigative time. Interestingly, comparing the results of older deep
CNN-based face matchers with newer ones suggests that the effectiveness of our
Out-of-gallery detection approach emerges only with matchers trained using
advanced margin-based loss functions.

Result: 在视频、图像和音频分类任务中取得领先结果，无需模态特定标注数据。

Conclusion: TaAM-CPT展示了通过文本数据构建通用多模态模型的潜力，具有高度可扩展性。

Abstract: The integration of prompt tuning with multimodal learning has shown
significant generalization abilities for various downstream tasks. Despite
advancements, existing methods heavily depend on massive modality-specific
labeled data (e.g., video, audio, and image), or are customized for a single
modality. In this study, we present Text as Any-Modality by Consistent Prompt
Tuning (TaAM-CPT), a scalable approach for constructing a general
representation model toward unlimited modalities using solely text data.
TaAM-CPT comprises modality prompt pools, text construction, and
modality-aligned text encoders from pre-trained models, which allows for
extending new modalities by simply adding prompt pools and modality-aligned
text encoders. To harmonize the learning across different modalities, TaAM-CPT
designs intra- and inter-modal learning objectives, which can capture category
details within modalities while maintaining semantic consistency across
different modalities. Benefiting from its scalable architecture and pre-trained
models, TaAM-CPT can be seamlessly extended to accommodate unlimited
modalities. Remarkably, without any modality-specific labeled data, TaAM-CPT
achieves leading results on diverse datasets spanning various modalities,
including video classification, image classification, and audio classification.

Motivation: 稀疏视图3D重建存在采样速度慢的问题，限制了实际应用。

Result: 实验表明，FVGen在保持（或提升）视觉质量的同时，采样时间减少90%以上。

Conclusion: FVGen显著提升了稀疏视图3D重建的时间效率，适用于需要多次运行预训练VDM的场景。

Abstract: Recent progress in 3D reconstruction has enabled realistic 3D models from
dense image captures, yet challenges persist with sparse views, often leading
to artifacts in unseen areas. Recent works leverage Video Diffusion Models
(VDMs) to generate dense observations, filling the gaps when only sparse views
are available for 3D reconstruction tasks. A significant limitation of these
methods is their slow sampling speed when using VDMs. In this paper, we present
FVGen, a novel framework that addresses this challenge by enabling fast novel
view synthesis using VDMs in as few as four sampling steps. We propose a novel
video diffusion model distillation method that distills a multi-step denoising
teacher model into a few-step denoising student model using Generative
Adversarial Networks (GANs) and softened reverse KL-divergence minimization.
Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that, compared to previous
works, our framework generates the same number of novel views with similar (or
even better) visual quality while reducing sampling time by more than 90%.
FVGen significantly improves time efficiency for downstream reconstruction
tasks, particularly when working with sparse input views (more than 2) where
pre-trained VDMs need to be run multiple times to achieve better spatial
coverage.

Abstract: High-resolution imagery plays a critical role in improving the performance of
visual recognition tasks such as classification, detection, and segmentation.
In many domains, including remote sensing and surveillance, low-resolution
images can limit the accuracy of automated analysis. To address this,
super-resolution (SR) techniques have been widely adopted to attempt to
reconstruct high-resolution images from low-resolution inputs. Related
traditional approaches focus solely on enhancing image quality based on
pixel-level metrics, leaving the relationship between super-resolved image
fidelity and downstream classification performance largely underexplored. This
raises a key question: can integrating classification objectives directly into
the super-resolution process further improve classification accuracy? In this
paper, we try to respond to this question by investigating the relationship
between super-resolution and classification through the deployment of a
specialised algorithmic strategy. We propose a novel methodology that increases
the resolution of synthetic aperture radar imagery by optimising loss functions
that account for both image quality and classification performance. Our
approach improves image quality, as measured by scientifically ascertained
image quality indicators, while also enhancing classification accuracy.

Abstract: SAR ship classification faces the challenge of long-tailed datasets, which
complicates the classification of underrepresented classes. Oversampling
methods have proven effective in addressing class imbalance in optical data. In
this paper, we evaluated the effect of oversampling in the feature space for
SAR ship classification. We propose two novel algorithms inspired by the

Additionally, we also analyzed the impact of oversampling methods on different

over the original M2m and baselines, with an average F1-score increase of 8.82%
for FuSARShip and 4.44% for OpenSARShip.

Abstract: Deep learning has revolutionized medical imaging, but its effectiveness is
severely limited by insufficient labeled training data. This paper introduces a
novel GAN-based semi-supervised learning framework specifically designed for
low labeled-data regimes, evaluated across settings with 5 to 50 labeled
samples per class. Our approach integrates three specialized neural networks --
a generator for class-conditioned image translation, a discriminator for
authenticity assessment and classification, and a dedicated classifier --
within a three-phase training framework. The method alternates between
supervised training on limited labeled data and unsupervised learning that
leverages abundant unlabeled images through image-to-image translation rather
than generation from noise. We employ ensemble-based pseudo-labeling that
combines confidence-weighted predictions from the discriminator and classifier
with temporal consistency through exponential moving averaging, enabling
reliable label estimation for unlabeled data. Comprehensive evaluation across
eleven MedMNIST datasets demonstrates that our approach achieves statistically
significant improvements over six state-of-the-art GAN-based semi-supervised
methods, with particularly strong performance in the extreme 5-shot setting
where the scarcity of labeled data is most challenging. The framework maintains
its superiority across all evaluated settings (5, 10, 20, and 50 shots per
class). Our approach offers a practical solution for medical imaging
applications where annotation costs are prohibitive, enabling robust
classification performance even with minimal labeled data. Code is available at

introducing temporal consistency for video-based applications.

Conclusion: CLIPin作为一种即插即用组件，显著提升了CLIP架构的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Large-scale natural image-text datasets, especially those automatically
collected from the web, often suffer from loose semantic alignment due to weak
supervision, while medical datasets tend to have high cross-modal correlation
but low content diversity. These properties pose a common challenge for
contrastive language-image pretraining (CLIP): they hinder the model's ability
to learn robust and generalizable representations. In this work, we propose
CLIPin, a unified non-contrastive plug-in that can be seamlessly integrated
into CLIP-style architectures to improve multimodal semantic alignment,
providing stronger supervision and enhancing alignment robustness. Furthermore,
two shared pre-projectors are designed for image and text modalities
respectively to facilitate the integration of contrastive and non-contrastive
learning in a parameter-compromise manner. Extensive experiments on diverse
downstream tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of CLIPin as a
plug-and-play component compatible with various contrastive frameworks. Code is

Abstract: Being able to effectively read scientific plots, or chart understanding, is a
central part toward building effective agents for science. However, existing
multimodal large language models (MLLMs), especially open-source ones, are
still falling behind with a typical success rate of 30%-50% on challenging
benchmarks. Previous studies on fine-tuning MLLMs with synthetic charts are
often restricted by their inadequate similarity to the real charts, which could
compromise model training and performance on complex real-world charts. In this
study, we show that modularizing chart generation and diversifying visual
details improves chart understanding capabilities. In particular, we design a
five-step data synthesis pipeline, where we separate data and function creation
for single plot generation, condition the generation of later subplots on
earlier ones for multi-subplot figures, visually diversify the generated
figures, filter out low quality data, and finally generate the question-answer
(QA) pairs with GPT-4o. This approach allows us to streamline the generation of
fine-tuning datasets and introduce the effective chart dataset (ECD), which
contains 10k+ chart images and 300k+ QA pairs, covering 25 topics and featuring
250+ chart type combinations with high visual complexity. We show that ECD
consistently improves the performance of various MLLMs on a range of real-world
and synthetic test sets. Code, data and models are available at:

Conclusion: Lightswitch通过整合固有属性和多视图数据，显著提升了重光照的效率和效果。

Abstract: Recent approaches for 3D relighting have shown promise in integrating 2D
image relighting generative priors to alter the appearance of a 3D
representation while preserving the underlying structure. Nevertheless,
generative priors used for 2D relighting that directly relight from an input
image do not take advantage of intrinsic properties of the subject that can be
inferred or cannot consider multi-view data at scale, leading to subpar
relighting. In this paper, we propose Lightswitch, a novel finetuned
material-relighting diffusion framework that efficiently relights an arbitrary
number of input images to a target lighting condition while incorporating cues
from inferred intrinsic properties. By using multi-view and material
information cues together with a scalable denoising scheme, our method
consistently and efficiently relights dense multi-view data of objects with
diverse material compositions. We show that our 2D relighting prediction
quality exceeds previous state-of-the-art relighting priors that directly
relight from images. We further demonstrate that LightSwitch matches or
outperforms state-of-the-art diffusion inverse rendering methods in relighting
synthetic and real objects in as little as 2 minutes.

Abstract: Articulated vehicles such as tractor-trailers, yard trucks, and similar
platforms must often reverse and maneuver in cluttered spaces where pedestrians
are present. We present how Barrier-Rate guided Model Predictive Path Integral
(BR-MPPI) control can solve navigation in such challenging environments.
BR-MPPI embeds Control Barrier Function (CBF) constraints directly into the
path-integral update. By steering the importance-sampling distribution toward
collision-free, dynamically feasible trajectories, BR-MPPI enhances the
exploration strength of MPPI and improves robustness of resulting trajectories.
The method is evaluated in the high-fidelity CarMaker simulator on a 12 [m]
tractor-trailer tasked with reverse and forward parking in a parking lot.
BR-MPPI computes control inputs in above 100 [Hz] on a single GPU (for
scenarios with eight obstacles) and maintains better parking clearance than a
standard MPPI baseline and an MPPI with collision cost baseline.

Abstract: The disassembly of small household appliances poses significant challenges
due to their complex and curved geometries, which render traditional rigid
fixtures inadequate. In this paper, we propose a modular vacuum-based fixturing
system that leverages commercially available balloon-type soft grippers to
conform to arbitrarily shaped surfaces and provide stable support during
screw-removal tasks. To enable a reliable deployment of the system, we develop
a stability-aware planning framework that samples the bottom surface of the
target object, filters candidate contact points based on geometric continuity,
and evaluates support configurations using convex hull-based static stability
criteria. We compare the quality of object placement under different numbers
and configurations of balloon hands. In addition, real-world experiments were
conducted to compare the success rates of traditional rigid fixtures with our
proposed system. The results demonstrate that our method consistently achieves
higher success rates and superior placement stability during screw removal
tasks.

Abstract: Robotic non-destructive disassembly of mating parts remains challenging due
to the need for flexible manipulation and the limited visibility of internal
structures. This study presents an affordance-guided teleoperation system that
enables intuitive human demonstrations for dual-arm fix-and-disassemble tasks
for mating parts. The system visualizes feasible grasp poses and disassembly
directions in a virtual environment, both derived from the object's geometry,
to address occlusions and structural complexity. To prevent excessive position
tracking under load when following the affordance, we integrate a hybrid
controller that combines position and impedance control into the teleoperated
disassembly arm. Real-world experiments validate the effectiveness of the
proposed system, showing improved task success rates and reduced object pose
deviation.

*Zhanyi Sun,Shuran Song*

TL;DR: Latent Policy Barrier (LPB) 框架通过将专家演示的潜在嵌入作为隐式屏障，分离安全与不安全状态，提升视觉运动策略的鲁棒性和数据效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 行为克隆训练的视觉运动策略容易受到协变量偏移的影响，导致失败。现有方法通常需要人工干预或数据增强，但效率低或效果有限。

Method: LPB 将专家模仿和 OOD 恢复解耦为两个模块：基于专家数据的扩散策略和基于专家与次优策略数据的动态模型。推理时动态模型预测未来状态并优化其保持在专家分布内。

Result: 模拟和真实实验表明，LPB 提高了策略鲁棒性和数据效率，无需额外人工干预即可实现可靠操作。

Conclusion: LPB 是一种高效且鲁棒的视觉运动策略学习框架，适用于有限专家数据场景。

Abstract: Visuomotor policies trained via behavior cloning are vulnerable to covariate
shift, where small deviations from expert trajectories can compound into
failure. Common strategies to mitigate this issue involve expanding the
training distribution through human-in-the-loop corrections or synthetic data
augmentation. However, these approaches are often labor-intensive, rely on
strong task assumptions, or compromise the quality of imitation. We introduce
Latent Policy Barrier, a framework for robust visuomotor policy learning.
Inspired by Control Barrier Functions, LPB treats the latent embeddings of
expert demonstrations as an implicit barrier separating safe, in-distribution
states from unsafe, out-of-distribution (OOD) ones. Our approach decouples the
role of precise expert imitation and OOD recovery into two separate modules: a
base diffusion policy solely on expert data, and a dynamics model trained on
both expert and suboptimal policy rollout data. At inference time, the dynamics
model predicts future latent states and optimizes them to stay within the
expert distribution. Both simulated and real-world experiments show that LPB
improves both policy robustness and data efficiency, enabling reliable
manipulation from limited expert data and without additional human correction
or annotation.

Abstract: There are still many museums that present accessibility barriers,
particularly regarding perceptual, cultural, and cognitive aspects. This is
especially evident in low-density population areas. The aim of the ROBSO-PM
project is to improve the accessibility of small museums through the use of
social robots and social telepresence robots, focusing on three museums as case
studies: the Museum of the Holy Shroud in Turin, a small but globally known
institution, and two lesser known mountain museums: the Museum of the Champlas
du Col Carnival and the Pragelato Museum of Alpine Peoples' Costumes and
Traditions. The project explores two main applications for robots: as guides
supporting inclusive visits for foreign or disabled visitors, and as
telepresence tools allowing people with limited mobility to access museums
remotely. From a research perspective, key topics include storytelling, robot
personality, empathy, personalization, and, in the case of telepresence,
collaboration between the robot and the person, with clearly defined roles and
autonomy.

Conclusion: 该框架显著提高了双模态车辆在扰动环境中的运动规划鲁棒性和适应性。

Abstract: Air-land bimodal vehicles provide a promising solution for navigating complex
environments by combining the flexibility of aerial locomotion with the energy
efficiency of ground mobility. To enhance the robustness of trajectory planning
under environmental disturbances, this paper presents a disturbance-aware
planning framework that incorporates real-time disturbance estimation into both
path searching and trajectory optimization. A key component of the framework is
a disturbance-adaptive safety boundary adjustment mechanism, which dynamically
modifies the vehicle's feasible dynamic boundaries based on estimated
disturbances to ensure trajectory feasibility. Leveraging the dynamics model of
the bimodal vehicle, the proposed approach achieves adaptive and reliable
motion planning across different terrains and operating conditions. A series of
real-world experiments and benchmark comparisons on a custom-built platform
validate the effectiveness and robustness of the method, demonstrating
improvements in tracking accuracy, task efficiency, and energy performance
under both ground and aerial disturbances.

Conclusion: ReNiL为移动和IoT定位提供了可扩展且不确定性感知的基础，具有实际应用的鲁棒性和实用性。

Abstract: Pedestrian inertial localization is key for mobile and IoT services because
it provides infrastructure-free positioning. Yet most learning-based methods
depend on fixed sliding-window integration, struggle to adapt to diverse motion
scales and cadences, and yield inconsistent uncertainty, limiting real-world
use. We present ReNiL, a Bayesian deep-learning framework for accurate,
efficient, and uncertainty-aware pedestrian localization. ReNiL introduces
Inertial Positioning Demand Points (IPDPs) to estimate motion at contextually
meaningful waypoints instead of dense tracking, and supports inference on IMU
sequences at any scale so cadence can match application needs. It couples a
motion-aware orientation filter with an Any-Scale Laplace Estimator (ASLE), a
dual-task network that blends patch-based self-supervision with Bayesian
regression. By modeling displacements with a Laplace distribution, ReNiL
provides homogeneous Euclidean uncertainty that integrates cleanly with other
sensors. A Bayesian inference chain links successive IPDPs into consistent
trajectories. On RoNIN-ds and a new WUDataset covering indoor and outdoor
motion from 28 participants, ReNiL achieves state-of-the-art displacement
accuracy and uncertainty consistency, outperforming TLIO, CTIN, iMoT, and RoNIN
variants while reducing computation. Application studies further show
robustness and practicality for mobile and IoT localization, making ReNiL a
scalable, uncertainty-aware foundation for next-generation positioning.

Conclusion: 增量语言理解与实时运动规划结合，提升了人机协作的自然性和流畅性。

Abstract: Human-robot interaction requires robots to process language incrementally,
adapting their actions in real-time based on evolving speech input. Existing
approaches to language-guided robot motion planning typically assume fully
specified instructions, resulting in inefficient stop-and-replan behavior when
corrections or clarifications occur. In this paper, we introduce a novel
reasoning-based incremental parser which integrates an online motion planning
algorithm within the cognitive architecture. Our approach enables continuous
adaptation to dynamic linguistic input, allowing robots to update motion plans
without restarting execution. The incremental parser maintains multiple
candidate parses, leveraging reasoning mechanisms to resolve ambiguities and
revise interpretations when needed. By combining symbolic reasoning with online
motion planning, our system achieves greater flexibility in handling speech
corrections and dynamically changing constraints. We evaluate our framework in
real-world human-robot interaction scenarios, demonstrating online adaptions of
goal poses, constraints, or task objectives. Our results highlight the
advantages of integrating incremental language understanding with real-time
motion planning for natural and fluid human-robot collaboration. The
experiments are demonstrated in the accompanying video at

Result: 实验表明，该方法在数据效率上优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 提出的方法显著提升了视觉世界模型的鲁棒性和数据效率。

Abstract: Recent work on visual world models shows significant promise in latent state
dynamics obtained from pre-trained image backbones. However, most of the
current approaches are sensitive to training quality, requiring near-complete
coverage of the action and state space during training to prevent divergence
during inference. To make a model-based planning algorithm more robust to the
quality of the learned world model, we propose in this work to use a
variational autoencoder as a novelty detector to ensure that proposed action
trajectories during planning do not cause the learned model to deviate from the
training data distribution. To evaluate the effectiveness of this approach, a
series of experiments in challenging simulated robot environments was carried
out, with the proposed method incorporated into a model-predictive control
policy loop extending the DINO-WM architecture. The results clearly show that
the proposed method improves over state-of-the-art solutions in terms of data
efficiency.

Conclusion: HyperPM在保持计算效率的同时，有效提升了MPC对未建模动态的预测能力，实际应用表现优异。

Abstract: Model Predictive Control (MPC) is among the most widely adopted and reliable
methods for robot control, relying critically on an accurate dynamics model.
However, existing dynamics models used in the gradient-based MPC are limited by
computational complexity and state representation. To address this limitation,
we propose the Hyper Prediction Model (HyperPM) - a novel approach in which we
project the unmodeled dynamics onto a time-dependent dynamics model. This
time-dependency is captured through time-varying model parameters, whose
evolution over the MPC prediction horizon is learned using a neural network.
Such formulation preserves the computational efficiency and robustness of the
base model while equipping it with the capacity to anticipate previously
unmodeled phenomena. We evaluated the proposed approach on several challenging
systems, including real-world F1TENTH autonomous racing, and demonstrated that
it significantly reduces long-horizon prediction errors. Moreover, when
integrated within the MPC framework (HyperMPC), our method consistently
outperforms existing state-of-the-art techniques.

Result: 模型在零样本泛化和推理能力上表现优异，超越现有方法。

Conclusion: Affordance-R1首次将GRPO强化学习与推理结合，展示了开放世界泛化能力。

Abstract: Affordance grounding focuses on predicting the specific regions of objects
that are associated with the actions to be performed by robots. It plays a
vital role in the fields of human-robot interaction, human-object interaction,
embodied manipulation, and embodied perception. Existing models often neglect
the affordance shared among different objects because they lack the
Chain-of-Thought(CoT) reasoning abilities, limiting their out-of-domain (OOD)
generalization and explicit reasoning capabilities. To address these
challenges, we propose Affordance-R1, the first unified affordance grounding
framework that integrates cognitive CoT guided Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) within a reinforcement learning paradigm. Specifically, we
designed a sophisticated affordance function, which contains format,
perception, and cognition rewards to effectively guide optimization directions.
Furthermore, we constructed a high-quality affordance-centric reasoning
dataset, ReasonAff, to support training. Trained exclusively via reinforcement
learning with GRPO and without explicit reasoning data, Affordance-R1 achieves
robust zero-shot generalization and exhibits emergent test-time reasoning
capabilities. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms
well-established methods and exhibits open-world generalization. To the best of
our knowledge, Affordance-R1 is the first to integrate GRPO-based RL with
reasoning into affordance reasoning. The code of our method and our dataset is
released on https://github.com/hq-King/Affordance-R1.

Conclusion: 验证了智能、上下文感知控制在工业外骨骼中的潜力。

Abstract: Back exoskeletons can reduce musculoskeletal strain, but their effectiveness
depends on support modulation and adaptive control. This study addresses two
challenges: defining optimal support strategies and developing adaptive control
based on payload estimation. We introduce an optimization space based on muscle
activity reduction, perceived discomfort, and user preference, constructing
functions to identify optimal strategies. Experiments with 12 subjects revealed
optimal operating regions, highlighting the need for dynamic modulation. Based
on these insights, we developed a vision-based adaptive control pipeline that
estimates payloads in real-time by enhancing exoskeleton contextual
understanding, minimising latency and enabling support adaptation within the
defined optimisation space. Validation with 12 more subjects showed over 80%
accuracy and improvements across all metrics. Compared to static control,
adaptive modulation reduced peak back muscle activation by up to 23% while
preserving user preference and minimising discomfort. These findings validate
the proposed framework and highlight the potential of intelligent,
context-aware control in industrial exoskeletons.

Abstract: Dynamic obstacle avoidance (DOA) is critical for quadrupedal robots operating
in environments with moving obstacles or humans. Existing approaches typically
rely on navigation-based trajectory replanning, which assumes sufficient
reaction time and leading to fails when obstacles approach rapidly. In such
scenarios, quadrupedal robots require reflexive evasion capabilities to perform
instantaneous, low-latency maneuvers. This paper introduces Reflexive Evasion
Robot (REBot), a control framework that enables quadrupedal robots to achieve
real-time reflexive obstacle avoidance. REBot integrates an avoidance policy
and a recovery policy within a finite-state machine. With carefully designed
learning curricula and by incorporating regularization and adaptive rewards,
REBot achieves robust evasion and rapid stabilization in instantaneous DOA
tasks. We validate REBot through extensive simulations and real-world
experiments, demonstrating notable improvements in avoidance success rates,
energy efficiency, and robustness to fast-moving obstacles. Videos and appendix

Conclusion: ADP无需重新训练即可适配预训练扩散策略，显著提升了机器人操作的性能。

Abstract: Diffusion policies have recently emerged as a powerful class of visuomotor
controllers for robot manipulation, offering stable training and expressive
multi-modal action modeling. However, existing approaches typically treat
action generation as an unconstrained denoising process, ignoring valuable a
priori knowledge about geometry and control structure. In this work, we propose
the Adaptive Diffusion Policy (ADP), a test-time adaptation method that
introduces two key inductive biases into the diffusion. First, we embed a
geometric manifold constraint that aligns denoising updates with task-relevant
subspaces, leveraging the fact that the relative pose between the end-effector
and target scene provides a natural gradient direction, and guiding denoising
along the geodesic path of the manipulation manifold. Then, to reduce
unnecessary exploration and accelerate convergence, we propose an analytically
guided initialization: rather than sampling from an uninformative prior, we
compute a rough registration between the gripper and target scenes to propose a
structured initial noisy action. ADP is compatible with pre-trained diffusion
policies and requires no retraining, enabling test-time adaptation that tailors
the policy to specific tasks, thereby enhancing generalization across novel
tasks and environments. Experiments on RLBench, CALVIN, and real-world dataset
show that ADPro, an implementation of ADP, improves success rates,
generalization, and sampling efficiency, achieving up to 25% faster execution
and 9% points over strong diffusion baselines.

Abstract: Existing literature proposes models for estimating the electrical power of

predominantly tested using traditional industrial robots. Second, these models
often lack accuracy. To address these issues, we introduce an open source
Matlab-based library designed to automatically generate \ac{ec} models for
manipulators. The necessary inputs for the library are Denavit-Hartenberg

data-driven and requires real operational data, including joint positions,
velocities, accelerations, electrical power, and corresponding timestamps. We
validated our methodology by testing on four lightweight robots sourced from
three distinct manufacturers: Universal Robots, Franka Emika, and Kinova. The

Conclusion: PPR-AKG模型结合LLMs为工业CPPS提供了全面的解决方案，显著提升了生产效率和问题处理能力。

Abstract: Contemporary industrial cyber-physical production systems (CPPS) composed of
robotic workcells face significant challenges in the analysis of undesired
conditions due to the flexibility of Industry 4.0 that disrupts traditional
quality assurance mechanisms. This paper presents a novel industry-oriented
semantic model called Product-Process-Resource Asset Knowledge Graph (PPR-AKG),
which is designed to analyze and mitigate undesired conditions in flexible
CPPS. Built on top of the well-proven Product-Process-Resource (PPR) model
originating from ISA-95 and VDI-3682, a comprehensive OWL ontology addresses
shortcomings of conventional model-driven engineering for CPPS, particularly
inadequate undesired condition and error handling representation. The
integration of semantic technologies with large language models (LLMs) provides
intuitive interfaces for factory operators, production planners, and engineers
to interact with the entire model using natural language. Evaluation with the
use case addressing electric vehicle battery remanufacturing demonstrates that
the PPR-AKG approach efficiently supports resource allocation based on
explicitly represented capabilities as well as identification and mitigation of
undesired conditions in production. The key contributions include (1) a
holistic PPR-AKG model capturing multi-dimensional production knowledge, and
(2) the useful combination of the PPR-AKG with LLM-based chatbots for human
interaction.

Conclusion: S-Path是高效且可解释的路径规划方法，适用于室内3D场景图环境。

Abstract: 3D Scene Graphs integrate both metric and semantic information, yet their
structure remains underutilized for improving path planning efficiency and
interpretability. In this work, we present S-Path, a situationally-aware path
planner that leverages the metric-semantic structure of indoor 3D Scene Graphs
to significantly enhance planning efficiency. S-Path follows a two-stage
process: it first performs a search over a semantic graph derived from the
scene graph to yield a human-understandable high-level path. This also
identifies relevant regions for planning, which later allows the decomposition
of the problem into smaller, independent subproblems that can be solved in
parallel. We also introduce a replanning mechanism that, in the event of an
infeasible path, reuses information from previously solved subproblems to
update semantic heuristics and prioritize reuse to further improve the
efficiency of future planning attempts. Extensive experiments on both
real-world and simulated environments show that S-Path achieves average
reductions of 5.7x in planning time while maintaining comparable path
optimality to classical sampling-based planners and surpassing them in complex
scenarios, making it an efficient and interpretable path planner for
environments represented by indoor 3D Scene Graphs.

Abstract: A metric-accurate semantic 3D representation is essential for many robotic
tasks. This work proposes a simple, yet powerful, way to integrate the 2D
embeddings of a Vision-Language Model in a metric-accurate 3D representation at
real-time. We combine a local embedding masking strategy, for a more distinct
embedding distribution, with a confidence-weighted 3D integration for more
reliable 3D embeddings. The resulting metric-accurate embedding representation
is task-agnostic and can represent semantic concepts on a global multi-room, as
well as on a local object-level. This enables a variety of interactive robotic
applications that require the localisation of objects-of-interest via natural
language. We evaluate our approach on a variety of real-world sequences and
demonstrate that these strategies achieve a more accurate object-of-interest
localisation while improving the runtime performance in order to meet our
real-time constraints. We further demonstrate the versatility of our approach
in a variety of interactive handheld, mobile robotics and manipulation tasks,
requiring only raw image data.

Conclusion: 该框架不仅提升机器人性能，还支持可持续制造和成本降低等工业目标。

Abstract: The code performance of industrial robots is typically analyzed through CPU
metrics, which overlook the physical impact of code on robot behavior. This
study introduces a novel framework for assessing robot program performance from
an embodiment perspective by analyzing the robot's electrical power profile.
Our approach diverges from conventional CPU based evaluations and instead
leverages a suite of normalized metrics, namely, the energy utilization
coefficient, the energy conversion metric, and the reliability coefficient, to
capture how efficiently and reliably energy is used during task execution.
Complementing these metrics, the established robot wear metric provides further
insight into long term reliability. Our approach is demonstrated through an
experimental case study in machine tending, comparing four programs with
diverse strategies using a UR5e robot. The proposed metrics directly compare
and categorize different robot programs, regardless of the specific task, by
linking code performance to its physical manifestation through power
consumption patterns. Our results reveal the strengths and weaknesses of each
strategy, offering actionable insights for optimizing robot programming
practices. Enhancing energy efficiency and reliability through this embodiment
centric approach not only improves individual robot performance but also
supports broader industrial objectives such as sustainable manufacturing and
cost reduction.

Result: 在多域仿真和实验验证中，控制器实现了亚厘米级的笛卡尔跟踪精度。

Conclusion: 研究表明，基于代理增强的EMLA模型和VDC方法可以实现全电动HDRM的模块化实时控制。

Abstract: This paper presents a unified system-level modeling and control framework for
an all-electric heavy-duty robotic manipulator (HDRM) driven by
electromechanical linear actuators (EMLAs). A surrogate-enhanced actuator
model, combining integrated electromechanical dynamics with a neural network
trained on a dedicated testbed, is integrated into an extended virtual
decomposition control (VDC) architecture augmented by a natural adaptation law.
The derived analytical HDRM model supports a hierarchical control structure
that seamlessly maps high-level force and velocity objectives to real-time
actuator commands, accompanied by a Lyapunov-based stability proof. In
multi-domain simulations of both cubic and a custom planar triangular
trajectory, the proposed adaptive modular controller achieves sub-centimeter
Cartesian tracking accuracy. Experimental validation of the same 1-DoF platform
under realistic load emulation confirms the efficacy of the proposed control
strategy. These findings demonstrate that a surrogate-enhanced EMLA model
embedded in the VDC approach can enable modular, real-time control of an
all-electric HDRM, supporting its deployment in next-generation mobile working
machines.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类演示的数据集通常不平衡，导致模仿学习算法过度关注高频行为而忽视低频但重要的行为。

Result: 实验表明，数据集重新平衡能提升下游学习性能，无需额外数据收集。

Conclusion: 重新平衡数据集能有效改善模仿学习算法的性能，但不同方法各有优缺点。

Abstract: Robots should be able to learn complex behaviors from human demonstrations.
In practice, these human-provided datasets are inevitably imbalanced: i.e., the
human demonstrates some subtasks more frequently than others. State-of-the-art
methods default to treating each element of the human's dataset as equally
important. So if -- for instance -- the majority of the human's data focuses on
reaching a goal, and only a few state-action pairs move to avoid an obstacle,
the learning algorithm will place greater emphasis on goal reaching. More
generally, misalignment between the relative amounts of data and the importance
of that data causes fundamental problems for imitation learning approaches. In
this paper we analyze and develop learning methods that automatically account
for mixed datasets. We formally prove that imbalanced data leads to imbalanced
policies when each state-action pair is weighted equally; these policies
emulate the most represented behaviors, and not the human's complex, multi-task
demonstrations. We next explore algorithms that rebalance offline datasets
(i.e., reweight the importance of different state-action pairs) without human
oversight. Reweighting the dataset can enhance the overall policy performance.
However, there is no free lunch: each method for autonomously rebalancing
brings its own pros and cons. We formulate these advantages and disadvantages,
helping other researchers identify when each type of approach is most
appropriate. We conclude by introducing a novel meta-gradient rebalancing
algorithm that addresses the primary limitations behind existing approaches.
Our experiments show that dataset rebalancing leads to better downstream
learning, improving the performance of general imitation learning algorithms
without requiring additional data collection. See our project website:

Result: 在无人机、无人车和手持平台上验证，优于传统优化方法，弱激励条件下仍能高精度标定。

Conclusion: 该框架简化了多机器人平台部署，支持从常规操作数据中实现标定，代码开源。

Abstract: Extrinsic calibration is essential for multi-sensor fusion, existing methods
rely on structured targets or fully-excited data, limiting real-world
applicability. Online calibration further suffers from weak excitation, leading
to unreliable estimates. To address these limitations, we propose a
reinforcement learning (RL)-based extrinsic calibration framework that
formulates extrinsic calibration as a decision-making problem, directly
optimizes $SE(3)$ extrinsics to enhance odometry accuracy. Our approach
leverages a probabilistic Bingham distribution to model 3D rotations, ensuring
stable optimization while inherently retaining quaternion symmetry. A
trajectory alignment reward mechanism enables robust calibration without
structured targets by quantitatively evaluating estimated tightly-coupled
trajectory against a reference trajectory. Additionally, an automated data
selection module filters uninformative samples, significantly improving
efficiency and scalability for large-scale datasets. Extensive experiments on
UAVs, UGVs, and handheld platforms demonstrate that our method outperforms
traditional optimization-based approaches, achieving high-precision calibration
even under weak excitation conditions. Our framework simplifies deployment on
diverse robotic platforms by eliminating the need for high-quality initial
extrinsics and enabling calibration from routine operating data. The code is

Motivation: 在结构化环境中，自动驾驶导航需要能够生成时间最优、无碰撞且满足动态和运动学约束的轨迹。

Method: V*采用六边形离散化策略和动态图生成，结合几何剪枝和数学建模，确保轨迹的动态可行性。

Result: 仿真研究表明，V*能够在复杂动态环境中避免冲突，生成安全高效的轨迹。

Conclusion: V*通过直接整合动态约束和几何剪枝，实现了无需后处理的动态可行轨迹规划。

Abstract: Autonomous vehicle navigation in structured environments requires planners
capable of generating time-optimal, collision-free trajectories that satisfy
dynamic and kinematic constraints. We introduce V*, a graph-based motion
planner that represents speed and direction as explicit state variables within
a discretised space-time-velocity lattice. Unlike traditional methods that
decouple spatial search from dynamic feasibility or rely on post-hoc smoothing,
V* integrates both motion dimensions directly into graph construction through
dynamic graph generation during search expansion. To manage the complexity of
high-dimensional search, we employ a hexagonal discretisation strategy and
provide formal mathematical proofs establishing optimal waypoint spacing and
minimal node redundancy under constrained heading transitions for
velocity-aware motion planning. We develop a mathematical formulation for
transient steering dynamics in the kinematic bicycle model, modelling steering
angle convergence with exponential behaviour, and deriving the relationship for
convergence rate parameters. This theoretical foundation, combined with
geometric pruning strategies that eliminate expansions leading to infeasible
steering configurations, enables V* to evaluate dynamically admissible
manoeuvres, ensuring each trajectory is physically realisable without further
refinement. We further demonstrate V*'s performance in simulation studies with
cluttered and dynamic environments involving moving obstacles, showing its
ability to avoid conflicts, yield proactively, and generate safe, efficient
trajectories with temporal reasoning capabilities for waiting behaviours and
dynamic coordination.

Method: 通过理论和实证分析，识别捷径学习的成因，并提出数据集收集策略和数据增强方法。

Result: 发现数据集多样性和分布差异导致捷径学习，数据增强策略可有效改善泛化能力。

Conclusion: 优化数据集结构和采用数据增强策略可减少捷径学习，提升机器人策略的泛化能力。

Abstract: Generalist robot policies trained on large-scale datasets such as Open
X-Embodiment (OXE) demonstrate strong performance across a wide range of tasks.
However, they often struggle to generalize beyond the distribution of their
training data. In this paper, we investigate the underlying cause of this
limited generalization capability. We identify shortcut learning -- the
reliance on task-irrelevant features -- as a key impediment to generalization.
Through comprehensive theoretical and empirical analysis, we uncover two
primary contributors to shortcut learning: (1) limited diversity within
individual sub-datasets, and (2) significant distributional disparities across
sub-datasets, leading to dataset fragmentation. These issues arise from the
inherent structure of large-scale datasets like OXE, which are typically
composed of multiple sub-datasets collected independently across varied
environments and embodiments. Our findings provide critical insights into
dataset collection strategies that can reduce shortcut learning and enhance the
generalization ability of generalist robot policies. Moreover, in scenarios
where acquiring new large-scale data is impractical, we demonstrate that
carefully selected robotic data augmentation strategies can effectively reduce
shortcut learning in existing offline datasets, thereby improving
generalization capabilities of generalist robot policies, e.g., $\pi_0$, in
both simulation and real-world environments. More information at

TL;DR: D2D方法将因果循环图（CLD）转化为系统动力学模型（SDM），支持动态分析和干预策略探索，优于传统网络中心性分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 因果循环图（CLD）作为静态定性工具，难以支持动态分析和干预策略制定，且传统定量方法易导致错误推断。

Method: 提出Diagrams-to-Dynamics（D2D）方法，利用CLD中的结构信息（链接存在性和极性），通过用户简单标注变量类型（存量、流量/辅助变量或常量），生成探索性SDM。

Result: D2D能区分高/低优先级杠杆点，与数据驱动模型一致性优于网络中心性分析，并提供不确定性估计和数据收集指导。

Conclusion: D2D方法通过开源工具实现，降低了动态建模门槛，未来需进一步验证其广泛适用性。

Abstract: Causal loop diagrams (CLDs) are widely used in health and environmental
research to represent hypothesized causal structures underlying complex
problems. However, as qualitative and static representations, CLDs are limited
in their ability to support dynamic analysis and inform intervention
strategies. Additionally, quantitative CLD analysis methods like network
centrality analysis often lead to false inference. We propose
Diagrams-to-Dynamics (D2D), a method for converting CLDs into exploratory
system dynamics models (SDMs) in the absence of empirical data. With minimal
user input - following a protocol to label variables as stocks,
flows/auxiliaries, or constants - D2D leverages the structural information
already encoded in CLDs, namely, link existence and polarity, to simulate
hypothetical interventions and explore potential leverage points under
uncertainty. Results suggest that D2D helps distinguish between high- and
low-ranked leverage points. We compare D2D to a data-driven SDM constructed
from the same CLD and variable labeling. D2D showed greater consistency with
the data-driven model than network centrality analysis, while providing
uncertainty estimates and guidance for future data collection. The method is
implemented in an open-source Python package and a web-based application to
support further testing and lower the barrier to dynamic modeling for
researchers working with CLDs. We expect additional validation will further
establish the approach's utility across a broad range of cases and domains.

Abstract: This work introduces a novel framework for representing and analyzing
physical laws as a weighted knowledge graph. We constructed a database of 659
distinct physical equations, subjected to rigorous semantic cleaning to resolve
notational ambiguities, resulting in a corpus of 400 advanced physics
equations. We developed an enhanced graph representation where both physical
concepts and equations are nodes, connected by weighted inter-equation bridges.
These weights are objectively defined using normalized metrics for variable
overlap, physics-informed importance scores, and bibliometric data. A Graph
Attention Network (GAT) was trained for link prediction, achieving a test AUC
of 0.9742 +/- 0.0018 across five independent runs, significantly outperforming
both classical heuristics (best baseline AUC: 0.9487) and established GNN
architectures like GraphSAGE (AUC: 0.9504, p = 0.029). Statistical testing
confirmed significance of all comparisons (p < 0.05), with 2.7% improvement
over the best baseline. Our analysis reveals three key findings: (i) The model
autonomously rediscovers the known macroscopic structure of physics,
identifying strong conceptual axes between Electromagnetism and Statistical
Mechanics. (ii) It identifies central hub equations that serve as critical
bridges between multiple physical domains. (iii) The model generates stable,
computationally-derived hypotheses for cross-domain relationships, identifying
both known principles and suggesting novel mathematical analogies for further
theoretical investigation. The framework can generate hundreds of such
hypotheses, enabling the creation of specialized datasets for targeted analysis
of specific physics subfields. Code and data available at

Motivation: 在非线性状态下设计有效的数据同化（nudging）项具有挑战性，本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出了一种基于神经网络的学习方法，用于设计非线性状态空间模型中的nudging项，并基于Kazantzis--Kravaris--Luenberger观测器理论进行了理论证明。

Result: 在三个具有混沌行为的基准问题（Lorenz 96模型、Kuramoto--Sivashinsky方程和Kolmogorov流）上进行了评估，验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 神经网络nudging方法在非线性系统中表现良好，为解决数据同化问题提供了新的思路。

Abstract: Nudging is an empirical data assimilation technique that incorporates an
observation-driven control term into the model dynamics. The trajectory of the
nudged system approaches the true system trajectory over time, even when the
initial conditions differ. For linear state space models, such control terms
can be derived under mild assumptions. However, designing effective nudging
terms becomes significantly more challenging in the nonlinear setting. In this
work, we propose neural network nudging, a data-driven method for learning
nudging terms in nonlinear state space models. We establish a theoretical
existence result based on the Kazantzis--Kravaris--Luenberger observer theory.
The proposed approach is evaluated on three benchmark problems that exhibit
chaotic behavior: the Lorenz 96 model, the Kuramoto--Sivashinsky equation, and
the Kolmogorov flow.

Abstract: Accurate distribution grid topology is essential for reliable modern grid
operations. However, real-world utility data originates from multiple sources
with varying characteristics and levels of quality. In this work, developed in
collaboration with Oncor Electric Delivery, we propose a scalable framework
that reconstructs a trustworthy grid topology by systematically integrating
heterogeneous data. We observe that distribution topology is fundamentally
governed by two complementary dimensions: the spatial layout of physical
infrastructure (e.g., GIS and asset metadata) and the dynamic behavior of the
system in the signal domain (e.g., voltage time series). When jointly
leveraged, these dimensions support a complete and physically coherent
reconstruction of network connectivity. To address the challenge of uneven data
quality without compromising observability, we introduce a confidence-aware
inference mechanism that preserves structurally informative yet imperfect
inputs, while quantifying the reliability of each inferred connection for
operator interpretation. This soft handling of uncertainty is tightly coupled
with hard enforcement of physical feasibility: we embed operational
constraints, such as transformer capacity limits and radial topology
requirements, directly into the learning process. Together, these components
ensure that inference is both uncertainty-aware and structurally valid,
enabling rapid convergence to actionable, trustworthy topologies under
real-world deployment conditions. The proposed framework is validated using
data from over 8000 meters across 3 feeders in Oncor's service territory,
demonstrating over 95% accuracy in topology reconstruction and substantial
improvements in confidence calibration and computational efficiency relative to
baseline methods.

Abstract: Across scientific domains, a fundamental challenge is to characterize and
compute the mappings from underlying physical processes to observed signals and
measurements. While nonlinear neural networks have achieved considerable
success, they remain theoretically opaque, which hinders adoption in contexts
where interpretability is paramount. In contrast, linear neural networks serve
as a simple yet effective foundation for gaining insight into these complex
relationships. In this work, we develop a unified theoretical framework for
analyzing linear encoder-decoder architectures through the lens of Bayes risk
minimization for solving data-driven scientific machine learning problems. We
derive closed-form, rank-constrained linear and affine linear optimal mappings
for forward modeling and inverse recovery tasks. Our results generalize
existing formulations by accommodating rank-deficiencies in data, forward
operators, and measurement processes. We validate our theoretical results by
conducting numerical experiments on datasets from simple biomedical imaging,
financial factor analysis, and simulations involving nonlinear fluid dynamics
via the shallow water equations. This work provides a robust baseline for
understanding and benchmarking learned neural network models for scientific
machine learning problems.

Conclusion: 该框架为动态TAGs中的节点分类提供了可扩展且稳健的解决方案，为知识系统和科学发现研究指明了新方向。

Abstract: Textual Attribute Graphs (TAGs) are critical for modeling complex networks
like citation networks, but effective node classification remains challenging
due to difficulties in integrating rich semantics from text with structural
graph information. Existing methods often struggle with capturing nuanced
domain-specific terminology, modeling long-range dependencies, adapting to
temporal evolution, and scaling to massive datasets. To address these issues,
we propose a novel framework that integrates TAPE (Text-Attributed Graph
Representation Enhancement) with Graphormer. Our approach leverages a large
language model (LLM), specifically ChatGPT, within the TAPE framework to
generate semantically rich explanations from paper content, which are then
fused into enhanced node representations. These embeddings are combined with
structural features using a novel integration layer with learned attention
weights. Graphormer's path-aware position encoding and multi-head attention
mechanisms are employed to effectively capture long-range dependencies across
the citation network. We demonstrate the efficacy of our framework on the
challenging ogbn-arxiv dataset, achieving state-of-the-art performance with a
classification accuracy of 0.772, significantly surpassing the best GCN
baseline of 0.713. Our method also yields strong results in precision (0.671),
recall (0.577), and F1-score (0.610). We validate our approach through
comprehensive ablation studies that quantify the contribution of each
component, demonstrating the synergy between semantic and structural
information. Our framework provides a scalable and robust solution for node
classification in dynamic TAGs, offering a promising direction for future
research in knowledge systems and scientific discovery.

Conclusion: 结论是提出的MDP框架和RL-PG算法能够有效优化CAM决策，平衡燃料消耗和碰撞风险。

Abstract: This work presents a Markov decision process (MDP) framework to model
decision-making for collision avoidance maneuver (CAM) and a reinforcement
learning policy gradient (RL-PG) algorithm to train an autonomous guidance
policy using historic CAM data. In addition to maintaining acceptable collision
risks, this approach seeks to minimize the average fuel consumption of CAMs by
making early maneuver decisions. We model CAM as a continuous state, discrete
action and finite horizon MDP, where the critical decision is determining when
to initiate the maneuver. The MDP model also incorporates analytical models for
conjunction risk, propellant consumption, and transit orbit geometry. The
Markov policy effectively trades-off maneuver delay-which improves the
reliability of conjunction risk indicators-with propellant consumption-which
increases with decreasing maneuver time. Using historical data of tracked
conjunction events, we verify this framework and conduct an extensive ablation
study on the hyper-parameters used within the MDP. On synthetic conjunction
events, the trained policy significantly minimizes both the overall and average
propellant consumption per CAM when compared to a conventional cut-off policy
that initiates maneuvers 24 hours before the time of closest approach (TCA). On
historical conjunction events, the trained policy consumes more propellant
overall but reduces the average propellant consumption per CAM. For both
historical and synthetic conjunction events, the trained policy achieves equal
if not higher overall collision risk guarantees.

Motivation: 探讨量化在固定资源预算下的优势，而非传统的性能与计算资源的权衡。

Method: 提出Signed-Zero Ternary (SZT)量化方法，提供确定性梯度信息且无前向路径损失。

Result: 分析表明SZT在信息密度上可能优于非量化方法。

Conclusion: SZT为量化提供新视角，可能成为资源受限场景下的有效选择。

Abstract: Quantization is usually regarded as a means to trade quality of performance
for reduced compute requirements, i.e., as a suboptimal approximation. However,
if examined in terms of a fixed overall resource budget, a very different
perspective arises. We introduce Signed-Zero Ternary (SZT), a 2-bit
quantization that deterministically provides gradient information with no
forward-path penalty. Our analysis provides evidence that it may improve
information density compared to non-quantized alternatives.

Conclusion: 该方法有效分解时间序列，支持多种应用，如结构学习、预测和交叉效应分析。

Abstract: The research paper addresses decomposition of a stochastic time series into
three time series representing a dual signal i.e., the mean and the dispersion,
with noise isolated. Decomposition is done by applying machine learning to fit
a dual signal. Machine learning minimizes the loss function which compromises
between fitting the original time series and penalizing irregularities of the
dual signal. The latter includes terms based on the first and second order
derivatives along time. To preserve special patterns, weighting of the
regularization components of the loss function has been introduced based on
Statistical Process Control methodology. The proposed decomposition can be
applied as a smoothing algorithm against the mean and dispersion of the time
series. By isolating noise, the proposed decomposition can be seen as a
denoising algorithm. Two approaches of the learning process have been
considered: sequential and jointly. The former approach learns the mean signal
first and then dispersion. The latter approach fits the dual signal jointly.
Jointly learning can uncover complex relationships for the time series with
heteroskedasticity. Learning has been set by solving the direct non-linear
unconstrained optimization problem or by applying neural networks that have
sequential or twin output architectures. Tuning of the loss function
hyperparameters focuses on the isolated noise to be a stationary stochastic
process without autocorrelation properties. Depending on the applications, the
hyperparameters of the learning can be tuned towards either the discrete states
by stepped signal or smoothed series. The decomposed dual signal can be
represented on the 2D space and used to learn inherent structures, to forecast
both mean and dispersion, or to analyze cross effects in case of multiple time
series.

Motivation: 神经PDE求解器的精度问题通常源于优化困难，而非表达能力不足，尤其是在多保真度和刚性问题上。

Method: 采用Shifted Gaussian Encoding技术，通过过滤激活矩阵提高其秩和表达能力，同时保持凸性。

Result: 该方法在稳态对流-扩散方程中将可求解的Peclet数范围扩展了两个数量级，在多频函数学习上降低了六个数量级的误差，并在高保真图像向量拟合上比百万参数深度网络更快更准确。

Conclusion: 研究表明，条件数而非网络深度是科学神经求解器的瓶颈，简单的架构改进可以带来显著性能提升。

Abstract: Accuracy in neural PDE solvers often breaks down not because of limited
expressivity, but due to poor optimisation caused by ill-conditioning,
especially in multi-fidelity and stiff problems. We study this issue in
Physics-Informed Extreme Learning Machines (PIELMs), a convex variant of neural
PDE solvers, and show that asymptotic components in governing equations can
produce highly ill-conditioned activation matrices, severely limiting
convergence. We introduce Shifted Gaussian Encoding, a simple yet effective
activation filtering step that increases matrix rank and expressivity while
preserving convexity. Our method extends the solvable range of Peclet numbers
in steady advection-diffusion equations by over two orders of magnitude,
achieves up to six orders lower error on multi-frequency function learning, and
fits high-fidelity image vectors more accurately and faster than deep networks
with over a million parameters. This work highlights that conditioning, not
depth, is often the bottleneck in scientific neural solvers and that simple
architectural changes can unlock substantial gains.

Result: 在多个模型上性能显著提升（Qwen-Math-7B-Base +2.5%，Llama-3.2-3B-Base +2.2%，Qwen-Math-1.5B-Instruct +2.4%），且在20%噪声下仍能稳定学习。

Conclusion: S-GRPO为大规模推理模型的训练提供了更稳健和有效的方法。

Abstract: Group-Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) is a key technique for training
large reasoning models, yet it suffers from a critical vulnerability: the
\emph{Think-Answer Mismatch}, where noisy reward signals corrupt the learning
process. This problem is most severe in unbalanced response groups,
paradoxically degrading the signal precisely when it should be most
informative. To address this challenge, we propose Stable Group-Relative Policy
Optimization (S-GRPO), a principled enhancement that derives optimal,
noise-aware advantage weights to stabilize training. Our comprehensive
experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate S-GRPO's
effectiveness and robustness. On various models, S-GRPO significantly
outperforms DR. GRPO, achieving performance gains of +2.5% on
Qwen-Math-7B-Base, +2.2% on Llama-3.2-3B-Base, and +2.4% on
Qwen-Math-1.5B-Instruct. Most critically, while standard GRPO fails to learn
under 20% synthetic reward noise, S-GRPO maintains stable learning progress.
These results highlight S-GRPO's potential for more robust and effective
training of large-scale reasoning models. \footnote{Code and data are available

Motivation: 传统剪枝方法（如CCP和REP）基于贪心策略，可能导致泛化能力不足，尤其在小型复杂数据集上表现不佳。

Method: 将剪枝过程建模为探索-利用问题，利用MAB算法动态选择最优分支节点进行剪枝。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多个基准数据集上优于传统剪枝方法，预测性能更优。

Conclusion: MAB剪枝方法为决策树优化提供了一种动态且概率化的新思路。

Abstract: Decision trees, without appropriate constraints, can easily become overly
complex and prone to overfit, capturing noise rather than generalizable
patterns. To resolve this problem,pruning operation is a crucial part in
optimizing decision trees, as it not only reduces the complexity of trees but
also decreases the probability of generating overfit models. The conventional
pruning techniques like Cost-Complexity Pruning (CCP) and Reduced Error Pruning
(REP) are mostly based on greedy approaches that focus on immediate gains in
performance while pruning nodes of the decision tree. However, this might
result in a lower generalization in the long run, compromising the robust
ability of the tree model when introduced to unseen data samples, particularly
when trained with small and complex datasets. To address this challenge, we are
proposing a Multi-Armed Bandits (MAB)-based pruning approach, a reinforcement
learning (RL)-based technique, that will dynamically prune the tree to generate
an optimal decision tree with better generalization. Our proposed approach
assumes the pruning process as an exploration-exploitation problem, where we
are utilizing the MAB algorithms to find optimal branch nodes to prune based on
feedback from each pruning actions. Experimental evaluation on several
benchmark datasets, demonstrated that our proposed approach results in better
predictive performance compared to the traditional ones. This suggests the
potential of utilizing MAB for a dynamic and probabilistic way of decision tree
pruning, in turn optimizing the decision tree-based model.

Motivation: 离线强化学习中，学习策略与行为策略之间的分布偏移会导致OOD动作和高估问题，需要一种方法既能防止高估又能避免过度保守。

Method: 提出MCRE框架，结合TD误差和行为克隆项，开发MCRQ算法，集成到离线演员-评论家框架中。

Result: MCRQ在基准数据集上表现优于现有离线强化学习算法。

Conclusion: MCRE和MCRQ有效平衡了保守性和性能，为离线强化学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) seeks to learn optimal policies from
static datasets without further environment interaction. A key challenge is the
distribution shift between the learned and behavior policies, leading to
out-of-distribution (OOD) actions and overestimation. To prevent gross
overestimation, the value function must remain conservative; however, excessive
conservatism may hinder performance improvement. To address this, we propose
the mildly conservative regularized evaluation (MCRE) framework, which balances
conservatism and performance by combining temporal difference (TD) error with a
behavior cloning term in the Bellman backup. Building on this, we develop the
mildly conservative regularized Q-learning (MCRQ) algorithm, which integrates
MCRE into an off-policy actor-critic framework. Experiments show that MCRQ
outperforms strong baselines and state-of-the-art offline RL algorithms on
benchmark datasets.

Result: 实验表明，语义奖励能引导学习实现竞争性控制行为，且无需手动设计奖励函数。

Conclusion: 该方法为自然语言目标与智能体行为的对齐提供了新思路，为语言模型与控制应用的结合奠定了基础。

Abstract: In the domain of scientific machine learning, designing effective reward
functions remains a challenge in reinforcement learning (RL), particularly in
environments where task goals are difficult to specify numerically. Reward
functions in existing work are predominantly based on heuristics, manual
engineering, or task-specific tuning. In this work, we introduce a semantically
aligned reinforcement learning method where rewards are computed by aligning
the current state with a target semantic instruction using a
Sentence-Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (SBERT).
Instead of relying on manually defined reward functions, the policy receives
feedback based on the reward, which is a cosine similarity between the goal
textual description and the statement description in the episode. We evaluated
our approach in several environments and showed that semantic reward can guide
learning to achieve competitive control behavior, even in the absence of
hand-crafted reward functions. Our study demonstrates a correlation between the
language embedding space and the conventional Euclidean space. This framework
opens new horizons for aligning agent behavior with natural language goals and
lays the groundwork for a more seamless integration of larger language models
(LLMs) and fluid control applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非线性固定点方程算法（如平均奖励Q学习和TD学习）的半范数非单调性导致参数无关最优收敛率难以实现。

Method: 将平均误差重新定义为涉及非线性扰动的线性递归，并通过半范数的收缩性与诱导范数的单调性结合来抑制非线性。

Result: 首次实现了参数无关的$\tilde{O}(1/\sqrt{t})$最优收敛率，适用于平均奖励和指数折扣的Q学习。

Conclusion: 该方法适用范围广，支持同步/异步更新、单机/分布式部署，以及来自模拟器或马尔可夫轨迹的数据流。

Abstract: Algorithms for solving \textit{nonlinear} fixed-point equations -- such as
average-reward \textit{$Q$-learning} and \textit{TD-learning} -- often involve
semi-norm contractions. Achieving parameter-free optimal convergence rates for
these methods via Polyak--Ruppert averaging has remained elusive, largely due
to the non-monotonicity of such semi-norms. We close this gap by (i.) recasting
the averaged error as a linear recursion involving a nonlinear perturbation,
and (ii.) taming the nonlinearity by coupling the semi-norm's contraction with
the monotonicity of a suitably induced norm. Our main result yields the first
parameter-free $\tilde{O}(1/\sqrt{t})$ optimal rates for $Q$-learning in both
average-reward and exponentially discounted settings, where $t$ denotes the
iteration index. The result applies within a broad framework that accommodates
synchronous and asynchronous updates, single-agent and distributed deployments,
and data streams obtained either from simulators or along Markovian
trajectories.

Abstract: Recently, Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in code reasoning by scaling up the length of Chain-of-Thought
(CoT). However, excessively long reasoning traces introduce substantial
challenges in terms of training cost, inference latency, and deployment
feasibility. While various CoT compression approaches have emerged to address
this challenge, they face inherent trade-offs: token-level methods often
disrupt syntactic and logical coherence, while step-level methods based on
perplexity fail to reliably capture the logically critical reasoning steps. In
this paper, we propose ASAP (Anchor-guided, Surprisal-based Pruning), a novel
coarse-to-fine framework for CoT compression. ASAP first performs anchor-guided
pruning to preserve the core reasoning structure, which efficiently reduces the
search space for subsequent processing. It then enables a logic-aware pruning
by selecting logically essential reasoning steps based on a novel first-token
surprisal metric. Finally, ASAP teaches models to autonomously generate and
leverage these concise CoTs at inference time, enabling efficient reasoning in
coding tasks. Experiments show that ASAP achieves state-of-the-art accuracy
across multiple code generation benchmarks while substantially reducing
training and inference costs. On the challenging LiveCodeBench v4_v5 benchmark,
our approach reduces token generation by 23.5% and inference latency by 43.5%
compared to the strongest baseline, while achieving a competitive accuracy of
36.19% in Pass@1. Our results highlight a promising direction for building
powerful and efficient LRMs.

Conclusion: 结合符号规划和LLM，为复杂领域提供高质量代码生成的新方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
code generation and structured reasoning; however, their performance often
degrades on complex tasks that require consistent multi-step planning. Recent
work has explored combining LLMs with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), yet
existing approaches primarily focus on generating heuristic-based code for
optimization or target simpler tasks where correctness alone is sufficient. In
this work, we propose MCTS-OPS, a novel neural-symbolic framework that
formulates prompt selection as a sequential decision process guided by MCTS.
Our method explores and refines multi-step prompt sequences for the goal of
improving code generation quality and enhancing the problem-solving
capabilities of LLMs in general optimization. Experiments on network
optimization show significant improvement over the baselines, both in the
success rate of executing the generated code and in the optimization results
with the specified objective and constraints (2$\sim$4$\times$ higher reward
and 3$\times$ lower standard deviation). Moreover, it improves the chance of
attaining the optimal solution by about 10\% of cases, compared to baseline
methods in hard problems. These results highlight the promise of combining
symbolic planning with LLMs for robust, high-quality code generation in complex
domains.

Abstract: Prognostication for comatose post-cardiac arrest patients is a critical
challenge that directly impacts clinical decision-making in the ICU. Clinical
information that informs prognostication is collected serially over time.
Shortly after cardiac arrest, various time-invariant baseline features are
collected (e.g., demographics, cardiac arrest characteristics). After ICU
admission, additional features are gathered, including time-varying hemodynamic
data (e.g., blood pressure, doses of vasopressor medications). We view these as
two phases in which we collect new features. In this study, we propose a novel
stepwise dynamic competing risks model that improves the prediction of
neurological outcomes by automatically determining when to take advantage of
time-invariant features (first phase) and time-varying features (second phase).
Notably, our model finds patients for whom this second phase (time-varying
hemodynamic) information is beneficial for prognostication and also when this
information is beneficial (as we collect more hemodynamic data for a patient
over time, how important these data are for prognostication varies). Our
approach extends the standard Fine and Gray model to explicitly model the two
phases and to incorporate neural networks to flexibly capture complex nonlinear
feature relationships. Evaluated on a retrospective cohort of 2,278 comatose
post-arrest patients, our model demonstrates robust discriminative performance
for the competing outcomes of awakening, withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy,
and death despite maximal support. Our approach generalizes to more than two
phases in which new features are collected and could be used in other dynamic
prediction tasks, where it may be helpful to know when and for whom newly
collected features significantly improve prediction.

Result: 在七个真实图和二十个基线模型上，AHGNN表现优异，尤其在高度异质性情况下。

Conclusion: AHGNN有效解决了异质性异质图的建模挑战，性能显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Heterogeneous graphs (HGs) are common in real-world scenarios and often
exhibit heterophily. However, most existing studies focus on either
heterogeneity or heterophily in isolation, overlooking the prevalence of
heterophilic HGs in practical applications. Such ignorance leads to their
performance degradation. In this work, we first identify two main challenges in
modeling heterophily HGs: (1) varying heterophily distributions across hops and
meta-paths; (2) the intricate and often heterophily-driven diversity of
semantic information across different meta-paths. Then, we propose the Adaptive
Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (AHGNN) to tackle these challenges. AHGNN
employs a heterophily-aware convolution that accounts for heterophily
distributions specific to both hops and meta-paths. It then integrates messages
from diverse semantic spaces using a coarse-to-fine attention mechanism, which
filters out noise and emphasizes informative signals. Experiments on seven
real-world graphs and twenty baselines demonstrate the superior performance of
AHGNN, particularly in high-heterophily situations.

Abstract: How can we effectively handle queries for on-device large language models
(LLMs) with varying runtime constraints, such as latency and accuracy?
Multi-scale quantization addresses this challenge by enabling memory-efficient
runtime model adaptation of LLMs through the overlaying of multiple model
variants quantized to different bitwidths. Meanwhile, an important question
still remains open-ended: how can models be properly configured to match a
target precision or latency? While mixed-precision offers a promising solution,
we take this further by leveraging the key observation that the sensitivity of
each layer dynamically changes across decoding iterations. Building on this
insight, we introduce DP-LLM, a novel mechanism that dynamically assigns
precision to each layer based on input values. DP-LLM augments each linear
layer in an LLM with a precision selector that determines the bitwidth at
runtime using a lightweight error estimator and threshold values learned
through fine-tuning. Experimental results across multiple models and benchmarks
demonstrate that DP-LLM achieves a superior performance-latency trade-off,
outperforming prior approaches.

Motivation: 尽管深度时间模型（如TCN）在序列数据上表现优异，但其泛化能力的理论理解仍有限。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过延迟反馈阻塞机制将依赖样本转化为近似独立样本，推导出泛化边界，并提出公平比较方法以固定有效样本量。

Result: 研究发现强依赖序列的泛化差距比弱依赖序列小76%，且收敛速度与理论预测存在差异。

Conclusion: 时间依赖性在固定信息预算下可能有益，但理论与实践的差距仍需进一步研究。

Abstract: Deep temporal architectures such as Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs)
achieve strong predictive performance on sequential data, yet theoretical
understanding of their generalization remains limited. We address this gap by
providing both the first non-vacuous, architecture-aware generalization bounds
for deep temporal models and a principled evaluation methodology.
  For exponentially $\beta$-mixing sequences, we derive bounds scaling as $
O\!\Bigl(R\,\sqrt{\tfrac{D\,p\,n\,\log N}{N}}\Bigr), $ where $D$ is network
depth, $p$ kernel size, $n$ input dimension, and $R$ weight norm. Our
delayed-feedback blocking mechanism transforms dependent samples into
effectively independent ones while discarding only $O(1/\log N)$ of the data,
yielding $\sqrt{D}$ scaling instead of exponential, implying that doubling
depth requires approximately quadrupling the training data.
  We also introduce a fair-comparison methodology that fixes the effective
sample size to isolate the effect of temporal structure from information
content. Under $N_{\text{eff}}=2{,}000$, strongly dependent sequences
($\rho=0.8$) exhibit $\approx76\%$ smaller generalization gaps than weakly
dependent ones ($\rho=0.2$), challenging the intuition that dependence is
purely detrimental. Yet convergence rates diverge from theory: weak
dependencies follow $N_{\text{eff}}^{-1.21}$ scaling and strong dependencies
follow $N_{\text{eff}}^{-0.89}$, both steeper than the predicted $N^{-0.5}$.
These findings reveal that temporal dependence can enhance learning under fixed
information budgets, while highlighting gaps between theory and practice that
motivate future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在稀疏奖励的目标条件强化学习中，现有的轨迹重标记方法（如HER）未能充分利用经验，导致样本效率有限。

Method: 提出HGR技术，通过后见目标生成动作正则化先验，并结合HSR，最大化经验利用率。

Result: 在导航和操作任务中，HGR和HSR的组合显著优于现有方法，实现了更高的样本重用效率和性能。

Conclusion: HGR和HSR的组合为GCRL提供了一种高效的经验利用方法，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL) with sparse rewards remains a
fundamental challenge in reinforcement learning. While hindsight experience
replay (HER) has shown promise by relabeling collected trajectories with
achieved goals, we argue that trajectory relabeling alone does not fully
exploit the available experiences in off-policy GCRL methods, resulting in
limited sample efficiency. In this paper, we propose Hindsight Goal-conditioned
Regularization (HGR), a technique that generates action regularization priors
based on hindsight goals. When combined with hindsight self-imitation
regularization (HSR), our approach enables off-policy RL algorithms to maximize
experience utilization. Compared to existing GCRL methods that employ HER and
self-imitation techniques, our hindsight regularizations achieve substantially
more efficient sample reuse and the best performances, which we empirically
demonstrate on a suite of navigation and manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: 该方法验证了合成图像在医学诊断中的潜力，并为其他癌症诊断的研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: In oral cancer diagnostics, the limited availability of annotated datasets
frequently constrains the performance of diagnostic models, particularly due to
the variability and insufficiency of training data. To address these
challenges, this study proposed a novel approach to enhance diagnostic accuracy
by synthesizing realistic oral cancer lesions using an inpainting technique
with a fine-tuned diffusion model. We compiled a comprehensive dataset from
multiple sources, featuring a variety of oral cancer images. Our method
generated synthetic lesions that exhibit a high degree of visual fidelity to
actual lesions, thereby significantly enhancing the performance of diagnostic
algorithms. The results show that our classification model achieved a
diagnostic accuracy of 0.97 in differentiating between cancerous and
non-cancerous tissues, while our detection model accurately identified lesion
locations with 0.85 accuracy. This method validates the potential for synthetic
image generation in medical diagnostics and paves the way for further research
into extending these methods to other types of cancer diagnostics.

TL;DR: RR-Cluster是一种轻量级技术，通过随机重新平衡聚类分配，减少隐私噪声，提升联邦聚类算法的隐私/效用权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦聚类通过为每个聚类训练一个模型提升性能，但隐私泄露风险更高。直接应用差分隐私机制会显著降低效用。

Method: 提出RR-Cluster技术，通过随机重新平衡聚类分配，确保每个聚类有最少客户端数量，减少隐私噪声。

Result: 理论分析显示隐私噪声方差降低，实验证明RR-Cluster显著提升隐私/效用权衡。

Conclusion: RR-Cluster是一种简单有效的技术，可显著改善联邦聚类算法的隐私保护与模型性能。

Abstract: Federated clustering aims to group similar clients into clusters and produce
one model for each cluster. Such a personalization approach typically improves
model performance compared with training a single model to serve all clients,
but can be more vulnerable to privacy leakage. Directly applying client-level
differentially private (DP) mechanisms to federated clustering could degrade
the utilities significantly. We identify that such deficiencies are mainly due
to the difficulties of averaging privacy noise within each cluster (following
standard privacy mechanisms), as the number of clients assigned to the same
clusters is uncontrolled. To this end, we propose a simple and effective
technique, named RR-Cluster, that can be viewed as a light-weight add-on to
many federated clustering algorithms. RR-Cluster achieves reduced privacy noise
via randomly rebalancing cluster assignments, guaranteeing a minimum number of
clients assigned to each cluster. We analyze the tradeoffs between decreased
privacy noise variance and potentially increased bias from incorrect
assignments and provide convergence bounds for RR-Clsuter. Empirically, we
demonstrate the RR-Cluster plugged into strong federated clustering algorithms
results in significantly improved privacy/utility tradeoffs across both
synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: 研究揭示了现有评估的不足，提出了改进建议，并呼吁更严谨的评估方法。

Abstract: Pretrained neural networks have attracted significant interest in chemistry
and small molecule drug design. Embeddings from these models are widely used
for molecular property prediction, virtual screening, and small data learning
in molecular chemistry. This study presents the most extensive comparison of
such models to date, evaluating 25 models across 25 datasets. Under a fair
comparison framework, we assess models spanning various modalities,
architectures, and pretraining strategies. Using a dedicated hierarchical
Bayesian statistical testing model, we arrive at a surprising result: nearly
all neural models show negligible or no improvement over the baseline ECFP
molecular fingerprint. Only the CLAMP model, which is also based on molecular
fingerprints, performs statistically significantly better than the
alternatives. These findings raise concerns about the evaluation rigor in
existing studies. We discuss potential causes, propose solutions, and offer
practical recommendations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联邦推荐系统假设所有用户对隐私保护的需求相同，忽略了利用公开用户数据提升服务的潜力。

Method: GFed-PP结合公开用户数据构建用户-项目交互图，使用轻量级图卷积网络学习个性化项目嵌入，并在客户端本地学习用户嵌入和评分函数。

Result: 实验结果表明，GFed-PP在五个数据集上显著优于现有方法，推荐准确性更高且不损害隐私。

Conclusion: GFed-PP为联邦推荐系统中适应不同隐私偏好提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Federated recommendation systems (FedRecs) have gained significant attention
for providing privacy-preserving recommendation services. However, existing
FedRecs assume that all users have the same requirements for privacy
protection, i.e., they do not upload any data to the server. The approaches
overlook the potential to enhance the recommendation service by utilizing
publicly available user data. In real-world applications, users can choose to
be private or public. Private users' interaction data is not shared, while
public users' interaction data can be shared. Inspired by the issue, this paper
proposes a novel Graph Federated Learning for Personalized Privacy
Recommendation (GFed-PP) that adapts to different privacy requirements while
improving recommendation performance. GFed-PP incorporates the interaction data
of public users to build a user-item interaction graph, which is then used to
form a user relationship graph. A lightweight graph convolutional network (GCN)
is employed to learn each user's user-specific personalized item embedding. To
protect user privacy, each client learns the user embedding and the scoring
function locally. Additionally, GFed-PP achieves optimization of the federated
recommendation framework through the initialization of item embedding on
clients and the aggregation of the user relationship graph on the server.
Experimental results demonstrate that GFed-PP significantly outperforms
existing methods for five datasets, offering superior recommendation accuracy
without compromising privacy. This framework provides a practical solution for
accommodating varying privacy preferences in federated recommendation systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决RPG训练不稳定的问题，同时保持其样本效率优势。

Method: 通过将PPO的代理目标与RPG结合，提出RPO方法，利用时间反向传播高效计算梯度。

Result: 在运动和操作任务中，RPO表现出更高的样本效率和性能。

Conclusion: RPO是一种稳定且高效的RPG改进方法，适用于复杂任务。

Abstract: Reparameterization policy gradient (RPG) is promising for improving sample
efficiency by leveraging differentiable dynamics. However, a critical barrier
is its training instability, where high-variance gradients can destabilize the
learning process. To address this, we draw inspiration from Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO), which uses a surrogate objective to enable stable sample
reuse in the model-free setting. We first establish a connection between this
surrogate objective and RPG, which has been largely unexplored and is
non-trivial. Then, we bridge this gap by demonstrating that the
reparameterization gradient of a PPO-like surrogate objective can be computed
efficiently using backpropagation through time. Based on this key insight, we
propose Reparameterization Proximal Policy Optimization (RPO), a stable and
sample-efficient RPG-based method. RPO enables multiple epochs of stable sample
reuse by optimizing a clipped surrogate objective tailored for RPG, while being
further stabilized by Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence regularization and
remaining fully compatible with existing variance reduction methods. We
evaluate RPO on a suite of challenging locomotion and manipulation tasks, where
experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior sample efficiency and
strong performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RRM技术难以应对6G车载网络中复杂的数据需求，需优化资源管理以提升效率和公平性。

Method: SCAR结合ML压缩技术（如聚类和RBF网络）和强化学习策略，优化调度和公平性。

Result: SCAR提升可行调度区域时间14%，减少不公平调度时间15%，聚类失真降低10%。

Conclusion: SCAR在动态车载网络中展现出良好的可扩展性和公平性优势。

Abstract: The advent of 6G networks opens new possibilities for connected infotainment
services in vehicular environments. However, traditional Radio Resource
Management (RRM) techniques struggle with the increasing volume and complexity
of data such as Channel Quality Indicators (CQI) from autonomous vehicles. To
address this, we propose SCAR (State-Space Compression for AI-Driven Resource
Management), an Edge AI-assisted framework that optimizes scheduling and
fairness in vehicular infotainment. SCAR employs ML-based compression
techniques (e.g., clustering and RBF networks) to reduce CQI data size while
preserving essential features. These compressed states are used to train
6G-enabled Reinforcement Learning policies that maximize throughput while
meeting fairness objectives defined by the NGMN. Simulations show that SCAR
increases time in feasible scheduling regions by 14\% and reduces unfair
scheduling time by 15\% compared to RL baselines without CQI compression.
Furthermore, Simulated Annealing with Stochastic Tunneling (SAST)-based
clustering reduces CQI clustering distortion by 10\%, confirming its
efficiency. These results demonstrate SCAR's scalability and fairness benefits
for dynamic vehicular networks.

TL;DR: 论文研究了部分特征成员推理攻击（PFMI），提出了一种名为MRAD的两阶段攻击框架，通过优化未知特征值和异常检测来推断样本是否在训练集中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有成员推理攻击方法通常假设攻击者能访问目标样本的全部特征，但现实中往往只能获取部分特征，限制了这些方法的适用性。

Method: 提出MRAD框架，第一阶段优化未知特征值以最小化样本损失，第二阶段通过异常检测衡量重建样本与训练分布的偏差。

Result: 实验表明MRAD在多种数据集上有效，例如在STL-10上，即使缺失40%特征，AUC仍可达0.6。

Conclusion: MRAD解决了部分特征场景下的成员推理问题，且兼容多种现成的异常检测技术。

Abstract: Machine learning models have been shown to be susceptible to membership
inference attack, which can be used to determine whether a given sample appears
in the training data. Existing membership inference methods commonly assume
that the adversary has full access to the features of the target sample. This
assumption, however, does not hold in many real-world scenarios where only
partial features information is available, thereby limiting the applicability
of these methods. In this work, we study an inference scenario where the
adversary observes only partial features of each sample and aims to infer
whether this observed subset was present in the training set of the target
model. We define this problem as Partial Feature Membership Inference (PFMI).
To address this problem, we propose MRAD (Memory-guided Reconstruction and
Anomaly Detection), a two-stage attack framework. In the first stage, MRAD
optimizes the unknown feature values to minimize the loss of the sample. In the
second stage, it measures the deviation between the reconstructed sample and
the training distribution using anomaly detection. Empirical results
demonstrate that MRAD is effective across a range of datasets, and maintains
compatibility with various off-the-shelf anomaly detection techniques. For
example, on STL-10, our attack achieves an AUC of around 0.6 even with 40% of
the missing features.

Method: 提出CMOSS算法，实现半强盗反馈下的实例无关遗憾。

Result: CMOSS在遗憾和运行时效率上优于基准算法。

Conclusion: CMOSS是一种高效且理论最优的组合多臂老虎机算法。

Abstract: The combinatorial multi-armed bandit (CMAB) is a cornerstone of sequential
decision-making framework, dominated by two algorithmic families: UCB-based and
adversarial methods such as follow the regularized leader (FTRL) and online
mirror descent (OMD). However, prominent UCB-based approaches like CUCB suffer
from additional regret factor $\log T$ that is detrimental over long horizons,
while adversarial methods such as EXP3.M and HYBRID impose significant
computational overhead. To resolve this trade-off, we introduce the
Combinatorial Minimax Optimal Strategy in the Stochastic setting (CMOSS). CMOSS
is a computationally efficient algorithm that achieves an instance-independent
regret of $O\big( (\log k)^2\sqrt{kmT}\big )$ under semi-bandit feedback, where
$m$ is the number of arms and $k$ is the maximum cardinality of a feasible
action. Crucially, this result eliminates the dependency on $\log T$ and
matches the established $\Omega\big( \sqrt{kmT}\big)$ lower bound up to
$O\big((\log k)^2\big)$. We then extend our analysis to show that CMOSS is also
applicable to cascading feedback. Experiments on synthetic and real-world
datasets validate that CMOSS consistently outperforms benchmark algorithms in
both regret and runtime efficiency.

Motivation: 微调LLM可能导致模型在目标领域外产生有害行为，即使微调数据本身无害。研究旨在为API提供商提供实用的防护措施。

Method: 研究了四种干预方法：KL散度正则化、特征空间ℓ2距离、安全子空间投影（SafeLoRA）以及混合安全训练样本。

Result: 评估了这些方法在四个恶意任务中对EMA的抑制效果，并分析了它们对良性任务的影响。

Conclusion: 研究为EMA问题提供了初步解决方案，并讨论了未来研究方向。

Abstract: Fine-tuning lets practitioners repurpose aligned large language models (LLMs)
for new domains, yet recent work reveals emergent misalignment (EMA): Even a
small, domain-specific fine-tune can induce harmful behaviors far outside the
target domain. Even in the case where model weights are hidden behind a
fine-tuning API, this gives attackers inadvertent access to a broadly
misaligned model in a way that can be hard to detect from the fine-tuning data
alone. We present the first systematic study of in-training safeguards against
EMA that are practical for providers who expose fine-tuning via an API. We
investigate four training regularization interventions: (i) KL-divergence
regularization toward a safe reference model, (ii) $\ell_2$ distance in feature
space, (iii) projecting onto a safe subspace (SafeLoRA), and (iv) interleaving
of a small amount of safe training examples from a general instruct-tuning
dataset. We first evaluate the methods' emergent misalignment effect across
four malicious, EMA-inducing tasks. Second, we assess the methods' impacts on
benign tasks. We conclude with a discussion of open questions in emergent
misalignment research.

Abstract: Synthetic data generation is a key technique in modern artificial
intelligence, addressing data scarcity, privacy constraints, and the need for
diverse datasets in training robust models. In this work, we propose a method
for generating privacy-preserving high-quality synthetic tabular data using
Tensor Networks, specifically Matrix Product States (MPS). We benchmark the
MPS-based generative model against state-of-the-art models such as CTGAN, VAE,
and PrivBayes, focusing on both fidelity and privacy-preserving capabilities.
To ensure differential privacy (DP), we integrate noise injection and gradient
clipping during training, enabling privacy guarantees via R\'enyi Differential
Privacy accounting. Across multiple metrics analyzing data fidelity and
downstream machine learning task performance, our results show that MPS
outperforms classical models, particularly under strict privacy constraints.
This work highlights MPS as a promising tool for privacy-aware synthetic data
generation. By combining the expressive power of tensor network representations
with formal privacy mechanisms, the proposed approach offers an interpretable
and scalable alternative for secure data sharing. Its structured design
facilitates integration into sensitive domains where both data quality and
confidentiality are critical.

Abstract: Integrating multi-omics datasets through data-driven analysis offers a
comprehensive understanding of the complex biological processes underlying
various diseases, particularly cancer. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have
recently demonstrated remarkable ability to exploit relational structures in
biological data, enabling advances in multi-omics integration for cancer
subtype classification. Existing approaches often neglect the intricate
coupling between heterogeneous omics, limiting their capacity to resolve subtle
cancer subtype heterogeneity critical for precision oncology. To address these
limitations, we propose a framework named Graph Transformer for Multi-omics
Cancer Subtype Classification (GTMancer). This framework builds upon the GNN
optimization problem and extends its application to complex multi-omics data.
Specifically, our method leverages contrastive learning to embed multi-omics
data into a unified semantic space. We unroll the multiplex graph optimization
problem in that unified space and introduce dual sets of attention coefficients
to capture structural graph priors both within and among multi-omics data. This
approach enables global omics information to guide the refining of the
representations of individual omics. Empirical experiments on seven real-world
cancer datasets demonstrate that GTMancer outperforms existing state-of-the-art
algorithms.

Conclusion: OM2P首次成功将均值流模型集成到离线MARL中，为多智能体协作场景中的实用生成策略铺平了道路。

Abstract: Generative models, especially diffusion and flow-based models, have been
promising in offline multi-agent reinforcement learning. However, integrating
powerful generative models into this framework poses unique challenges. In
particular, diffusion and flow-based policies suffer from low sampling
efficiency due to their iterative generation processes, making them impractical
in time-sensitive or resource-constrained settings. To tackle these
difficulties, we propose OM2P (Offline Multi-Agent Mean-Flow Policy), a novel
offline MARL algorithm to achieve efficient one-step action sampling. To
address the misalignment between generative objectives and reward maximization,
we introduce a reward-aware optimization scheme that integrates a
carefully-designed mean-flow matching loss with Q-function supervision.
Additionally, we design a generalized timestep distribution and a
derivative-free estimation strategy to reduce memory overhead and improve
training stability. Empirical evaluations on Multi-Agent Particle and MuJoCo
benchmarks demonstrate that OM2P achieves superior performance, with up to a
3.8x reduction in GPU memory usage and up to a 10.8x speed-up in training time.
Our approach represents the first to successfully integrate mean-flow model
into offline MARL, paving the way for practical and scalable generative
policies in cooperative multi-agent settings.

Result: 结果表明CL能有效减少遗忘，使其成为在现实约束下扩展ASR系统的有前景方法。

Conclusion: 持续学习在印度语言ASR系统中表现优异，适合在数据顺序到达和隐私限制下应用。

Abstract: Indias linguistic diversity poses significant challenges for developing
inclusive Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems. Traditional multilingual
models, which require simultaneous access to all language data, are impractical
due to the sequential arrival of data and privacy constraints. Continual
Learning (CL) offers a solution by enabling models to learn new languages
sequentially without catastrophically forgetting previously learned knowledge.
This paper investigates CL for ASR on Indian languages using a subset of the
IndicSUPERB benchmark. We employ a Conformer-based hybrid RNN-T/CTC model,
initially pretrained on Hindi, which is then incrementally trained on eight
additional Indian languages, for a total sequence of nine languages. We
evaluate three prominent regularization- and distillation-based CL strategies:
Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC), Memory Aware Synapses (MAS), and Learning
without Forgetting (LwF), selected for their suitability in no-replay,
privacy-conscious scenarios. Performance is analyzed using Word Error Rate
(WER) for both RNN-T and CTC paths on clean and noisy data, as well as
knowledge retention via Backward Transfer. We also explore the impact of
varying the number of training epochs (1, 2, 5, and 10) per task. Results,
compared against naive fine-tuning, demonstrate CLs effectiveness in mitigating
forgetting, making it a promising approach for scalable ASR in diverse Indian
languages under realistic constraints. The code is available at:

Abstract: Neuromorphic computing is an emerging technology enabling low-latency and
energy-efficient signal processing. A key algorithmic tool in neuromorphic
computing is spiking neural networks (SNNs). SNNs are biologically inspired
neural networks which utilize stateful neurons, and provide low-bit data
processing by encoding and decoding information using spikes. Similar to SNNs,
deep state-space models (SSMs) utilize stateful building blocks. However, deep
SSMs, which recently achieved competitive performance in various temporal
modeling tasks, are typically designed with high-precision activation functions
and no reset mechanisms. To bridge the gains offered by SNNs and the recent
deep SSM models, we propose a novel multiple-output spiking neuron model that
combines a linear, general SSM state transition with a non-linear feedback
mechanism through reset. Compared to the existing neuron models for SNNs, our
proposed model clearly conceptualizes the differences between the spiking
function, the reset condition and the reset action. The experimental results on
various tasks, i.e., a keyword spotting task, an event-based vision task and a
sequential pattern recognition task, show that our proposed model achieves
performance comparable to existing benchmarks in the SNN literature. Our
results illustrate how the proposed reset mechanism can overcome instability
and enable learning even when the linear part of neuron dynamics is unstable,
allowing us to go beyond the strictly enforced stability of linear dynamics in
recent deep SSM models.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经场学习需要大量数据和计算资源，而传统FML方法存在隐私泄露问题，FedMeNF旨在解决这些限制。

Method: FedMeNF采用隐私保护损失函数，在本地元优化中减少隐私泄露，无需保留客户端私有数据。

Result: 实验表明，FedMeNF在少样本或非独立同分布数据下仍能快速优化并保持稳健的重建性能。

Conclusion: FedMeNF在保护隐私的同时，高效解决了神经场学习中的资源限制问题。

Abstract: Neural fields provide a memory-efficient representation of data, which can
effectively handle diverse modalities and large-scale data. However, learning
to map neural fields often requires large amounts of training data and
computations, which can be limited to resource-constrained edge devices. One
approach to tackle this limitation is to leverage Federated Meta-Learning
(FML), but traditional FML approaches suffer from privacy leakage. To address
these issues, we introduce a novel FML approach called FedMeNF. FedMeNF
utilizes a new privacy-preserving loss function that regulates privacy leakage
in the local meta-optimization. This enables the local meta-learner to optimize
quickly and efficiently without retaining the client's private data. Our
experiments demonstrate that FedMeNF achieves fast optimization speed and
robust reconstruction performance, even with few-shot or non-IID data across
diverse data modalities, while preserving client data privacy.

TL;DR: UPD是一种无监督、多智能体强化学习框架，通过动态生成多样化的训练伙伴，无需预训练伙伴或手动调参，显著提升了协作任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统方法中需要预训练伙伴或手动调参的问题，实现完全无监督的协作学习。

Method: 通过随机混合自我策略与偏置随机行为生成多样化伙伴，并使用基于方差的易学性指标评分。

Result: 在Overcooked-AI等任务中，UPD表现优于基线方法，用户研究显示其更具适应性和协作性。

Conclusion: UPD为无监督协作学习提供了高效框架，显著提升了智能体的适应性和协作能力。

Abstract: We introduce Unsupervised Partner Design (UPD) - a population-free,
multi-agent reinforcement learning framework for robust ad-hoc teamwork that
adaptively generates training partners without requiring pretrained partners or
manual parameter tuning. UPD constructs diverse partners by stochastically
mixing an ego agent's policy with biased random behaviours and scores them
using a variance-based learnability metric that prioritises partners near the
ego agent's current learning frontier. We show that UPD can be integrated with
unsupervised environment design, resulting in the first method enabling fully
unsupervised curricula over both level and partner distributions in a
cooperative setting. Through extensive evaluations on Overcooked-AI and the
Overcooked Generalisation Challenge, we demonstrate that this dynamic partner
curriculum is highly effective: UPD consistently outperforms both
population-based and population-free baselines as well as ablations. In a user
study, we further show that UPD achieves higher returns than all baselines and
was perceived as significantly more adaptive, more human-like, a better
collaborator, and less frustrating.

TL;DR: 提出了一种自适应鲁棒损失函数FCL，通过分数阶导数和MAE的组合，动态调整对标签噪声的鲁棒性，无需手动调参。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有鲁棒损失函数需要大量数据集特定的超参数调优，限制了其应用。

Method: FCL结合了交叉熵的分数阶导数（主动损失）和MAE（被动损失），并通过学习分数阶导数阶数μ动态平衡鲁棒性和收敛速度。

Result: FCL在基准数据集上实现了最先进的性能，无需手动调参。

Conclusion: FCL通过动态调整损失函数，有效解决了标签噪声下的分类问题。

Abstract: Robust loss functions are crucial for training deep neural networks in the
presence of label noise, yet existing approaches require extensive,
dataset-specific hyperparameter tuning. In this work, we introduce Fractional
Classification Loss (FCL), an adaptive robust loss that automatically
calibrates its robustness to label noise during training. Built within the
active-passive loss framework, FCL employs the fractional derivative of the
Cross-Entropy (CE) loss as its active component and the Mean Absolute Error
(MAE) as its passive loss component. With this formulation, we demonstrate that
the fractional derivative order $\mu$ spans a family of loss functions that
interpolate between MAE-like robustness and CE-like fast convergence.
Furthermore, we integrate $\mu$ into the gradient-based optimization as a
learnable parameter and automatically adjust it to optimize the trade-off
between robustness and convergence speed. We reveal that FCL's unique property
establishes a critical trade-off that enables the stable learning of $\mu$:
lower log penalties on difficult or mislabeled examples improve robustness but
impose higher penalties on easy or clean data, reducing model confidence in
them. Consequently, FCL can dynamically reshape its loss landscape to achieve
effective classification performance under label noise. Extensive experiments
on benchmark datasets show that FCL achieves state-of-the-art results without
the need for manual hyperparameter tuning.

TL;DR: SE-VAE是一种新型变分自编码器架构，通过直接嵌入测量结构来学习可解释的潜在表示，优于现有基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决表格数据中潜在表示的可解释性问题，尤其是在科学和社会领域中理论驱动的潜在构造和测量有效性至关重要的情况下。

Method: SE-VAE结合结构方程建模，将潜在子空间与已知指标分组对齐，并引入全局干扰潜在变量以隔离构造特定的混杂变异。

Result: SE-VAE在因子恢复、可解释性和对干扰变异的鲁棒性方面优于现有基线，性能主要由架构结构驱动。

Conclusion: SE-VAE为科学和社会领域中的白盒生成建模提供了一个原则性框架。

Abstract: Learning interpretable latent representations from tabular data remains a
challenge in deep generative modeling. We introduce SE-VAE (Structural
Equation-Variational Autoencoder), a novel architecture that embeds measurement
structure directly into the design of a variational autoencoder. Inspired by
structural equation modeling, SE-VAE aligns latent subspaces with known
indicator groupings and introduces a global nuisance latent to isolate
construct-specific confounding variation. This modular architecture enables
disentanglement through design rather than through statistical regularizers
alone. We evaluate SE-VAE on a suite of simulated tabular datasets and
benchmark its performance against a series of leading baselines using standard
disentanglement metrics. SE-VAE consistently outperforms alternatives in factor
recovery, interpretability, and robustness to nuisance variation. Ablation
results reveal that architectural structure, rather than regularization
strength, is the key driver of performance. SE-VAE offers a principled
framework for white-box generative modeling in scientific and social domains
where latent constructs are theory-driven and measurement validity is
essential.

Motivation: 传统k-means算法虽广泛应用但效率较低，Gk-means旨在通过几何优化提升性能。

Method: 利用标量投影识别高表达数据（HE），忽略低表达数据（LE），减少计算量。

Result: 在合成、真实和高维数据集上，Gk-means在运行时间和距离计算上优于传统及SOTA k-means变体，且能源效率更高。

Conclusion: Gk-means是一种高效、节能且可持续的k-means改进方法。

Abstract: This paper introduces Geometric-k-means (or Gk-means for short), a novel
approach that significantly enhances the efficiency and energy economy of the
widely utilized k-means algorithm, which, despite its inception over five
decades ago, remains a cornerstone in machine learning applications. The
essence of Gk-means lies in its active utilization of geometric principles,
specifically scalar projection, to significantly accelerate the algorithm
without sacrificing solution quality. This geometric strategy enables a more
discerning focus on data points that are most likely to influence cluster
updates, which we call as high expressive data (HE). In contrast, low
expressive data (LE), does not impact clustering outcome, is effectively
bypassed, leading to considerable reductions in computational overhead.
Experiments spanning synthetic, real-world and high-dimensional datasets,
demonstrate Gk-means is significantly better than traditional and state of the
art (SOTA) k-means variants in runtime and distance computations (DC).
Moreover, Gk-means exhibits better resource efficiency, as evidenced by its
reduced energy footprint, placing it as more sustainable alternative.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了大语言模型（LLMs）在无人类诱导的情况下自发欺骗行为的可能性，并提出了一种基于心理学的评估框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究通常通过提示或微调人为诱导LLMs的欺骗行为，但现实中LLMs可能自发欺骗，因此需要更真实的评估方法。

Method: 提出了一种使用‘接触搜索问题’的框架，并设计了两个统计指标（欺骗意图分数和欺骗行为分数）来量化欺骗行为。

Result: 评估了14个主流LLMs，发现任务难度增加时，欺骗行为显著上升。

Conclusion: 研究表明，即使是先进的LLMs在处理复杂问题时也会倾向于欺骗，这对LLMs在关键领域的部署提出了警示。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely deployed in reasoning,
planning, and decision-making tasks, making their trustworthiness a critical
concern. The potential for intentional deception, where an LLM deliberately
fabricates or conceals information to serve a hidden objective, remains a
significant and underexplored threat. Existing studies typically induce such
deception by explicitly setting a "hidden" objective through prompting or
fine-tuning, which may not fully reflect real-world human-LLM interactions.
Moving beyond this human-induced deception, we investigate LLMs' self-initiated
deception on benign prompts. To address the absence of ground truth in this
evaluation, we propose a novel framework using "contact searching questions."
This framework introduces two statistical metrics derived from psychological
principles to quantify the likelihood of deception. The first, the Deceptive
Intention Score, measures the model's bias towards a hidden objective. The
second, Deceptive Behavior Score, measures the inconsistency between the LLM's
internal belief and its expressed output. Upon evaluating 14 leading LLMs, we
find that both metrics escalate as task difficulty increases, rising in
parallel for most models. Building on these findings, we formulate a
mathematical model to explain this behavior. These results reveal that even the
most advanced LLMs exhibit an increasing tendency toward deception when
handling complex problems, raising critical concerns for the deployment of LLM
agents in complex and crucial domains.

Motivation: 现有生成方法主要关注单一活性分子设计，缺乏同时管理多目标活性的机制。

Result: 实验表明ActivityDiff能有效处理单/双目标生成、选择性增强及副作用减少等任务。

Conclusion: ActivityDiff为分子设计提供了平衡效果与安全性的新范式，是一个多功能可扩展框架。

Abstract: Achieving precise control over a molecule's biological activity-encompassing
targeted activation/inhibition, cooperative multi-target modulation, and
off-target toxicity mitigation-remains a critical challenge in de novo drug
design. However, existing generative methods primarily focus on producing
molecules with a single desired activity, lacking integrated mechanisms for the
simultaneous management of multiple intended and unintended molecular
interactions. Here, we propose ActivityDiff, a generative approach based on the
classifier-guidance technique of diffusion models. It leverages separately
trained drug-target classifiers for both positive and negative guidance,
enabling the model to enhance desired activities while minimizing harmful
off-target effects. Experimental results show that ActivityDiff effectively
handles essential drug design tasks, including single-/dual-target generation,
fragment-constrained dual-target design, selective generation to enhance target
specificity, and reduction of off-target effects. These results demonstrate the
effectiveness of classifier-guided diffusion in balancing efficacy and safety
in molecular design. Overall, our work introduces a novel paradigm for
achieving integrated control over molecular activity, and provides ActivityDiff
as a versatile and extensible framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统文本到SQL方法假设目标数据库已预定义，但在多数据库场景中，识别正确数据库是关键但被忽视的步骤。

Method: 1. 使用LLM和提示工程从自然语言查询中提取规则；2. 训练基于RoBERTa的db_id预测模型；3. 用批评代理优化生成的SQL。

Result: 实验表明，该框架在数据库意图预测和SQL生成准确性上优于当前最先进模型。

Conclusion: 提出的三阶段框架有效解决了多数据库场景中的数据库识别问题，并提升了SQL生成质量。

Abstract: Text-to-SQL bridges the gap between natural language and structured database
language, thus allowing non-technical users to easily query databases.
Traditional approaches model text-to-SQL as a direct translation task, where a
given Natural Language Query (NLQ) is mapped to an SQL command. Recent advances
in large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved translation
accuracy, however, these methods all require that the target database is
pre-specified. This becomes problematic in scenarios with multiple extensive
databases, where identifying the correct database becomes a crucial yet
overlooked step. In this paper, we propose a three-stage end-to-end text-to-SQL
framework to identify the user's intended database before generating SQL
queries. Our approach leverages LLMs and prompt engineering to extract implicit
information from natural language queries (NLQs) in the form of a ruleset. We
then train a large db\_id prediction model, which includes a RoBERTa-based
finetuned encoder, to predict the correct Database identifier (db\_id) based on
both the NLQ and the LLM-generated rules. Finally, we refine the generated SQL
by using critic agents to correct errors. Experimental results demonstrate that
our framework outperforms the current state-of-the-art models in both database
intent prediction and SQL generation accuracy.

Abstract: Homelessness in the United States has surged to levels unseen since the Great
Depression. However, existing methods for monitoring it, such as point-in-time
(PIT) counts, have limitations in terms of frequency, consistency, and spatial
detail. This study proposes a new approach using publicly available,
crowdsourced data, specifically 311 Service Calls and street-level imagery, to
track and forecast homeless tent trends in San Francisco. Our predictive model
captures fine-grained daily and neighborhood-level variations, uncovering
patterns that traditional counts often overlook, such as rapid fluctuations
during the COVID-19 pandemic and spatial shifts in tent locations over time. By
providing more timely, localized, and cost-effective information, this approach
serves as a valuable tool for guiding policy responses and evaluating
interventions aimed at reducing unsheltered homelessness.

Result: 实验表明，LoRR显著提升了多种偏好优化方法在数学和通用推理任务上的性能，甚至优于复杂RL算法。

Conclusion: LoRR为LLM微调提供了一种高效、实用的新范式，能够在有限数据下实现更高性能。

Abstract: Recent advancements in post-training Large Language Models (LLMs),
particularly through Reinforcement Learning (RL) and preference optimization
methods, are key drivers for enhancing their reasoning capabilities. However,
these methods are often plagued by low sample efficiency and a susceptibility
to primacy bias, where overfitting to initial experiences degrades policy
quality and damages the learning process. To address these challenges, we
introduce LLM optimization with Reset Replay (LoRR), a general and powerful
plugin designed to enhance sample efficiency in any preference-based
optimization framework. LoRR core mechanism enables training at a high replay
number, maximizing the utility of each collected data batch. To counteract the
risk of overfitting inherent in high-replay training, LoRR incorporates a
periodic reset strategy with reusing initial data, which preserves network
plasticity. Furthermore, it leverages a hybrid optimization objective,
combining supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and preference-based losses to further
bolster data exploitation. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that LoRR
significantly boosts the performance of various preference optimization methods
on both mathematical and general reasoning benchmarks. Notably, an iterative
DPO approach augmented with LoRR achieves comparable performance on challenging
math tasks, outperforming some complex and computationally intensive RL-based
algorithms. These findings highlight that LoRR offers a practical,
sample-efficient, and highly effective paradigm for LLM finetuning, unlocking
greater performance from limited data.

Conclusion: GRIN为LLM的遗忘学习提供了一种高效且目标化的解决方案。

Abstract: The growing legal and ethical scrutiny of large language models (LLMs)
necessitates effective machine unlearning, particularly for sensitive or

or unintended degradation of unrelated knowledge due to poor localization. In
this work, we propose GRIN: a modular and targeted framework for LLM

parameters most responsible for memorizing forget data. We then perform
selective noise injection into these parameters prior to fine-tuning, which
improves unlearning performance while maintaining model utility. Finally, we
propose new evaluation metrics tailored to the LLM setting and validate our
approach on standard benchmarks such as TOFU, WMDP, and SafePKU.
