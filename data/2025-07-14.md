Abstract: This report presents the CuriosAI team's submission to the EgoExo4D
Proficiency Estimation Challenge at CVPR 2025. We propose two methods for
multi-view skill assessment: (1) a multi-task learning framework using
Sapiens-2B that jointly predicts proficiency and scenario labels (43.6 %
accuracy), and (2) a two-stage pipeline combining zero-shot scenario
recognition with view-specific VideoMAE classifiers (47.8 % accuracy). The
superior performance of the two-stage approach demonstrates the effectiveness
of scenario-conditioned modeling for proficiency estimation.

*Mihir Gupta,Abhay Mangla,Ross Greer,Pratik Desai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合提示专家评估和自一致性机制的农业图像处理框架，显著提升了玉米叶病害识别的准确性和治疗建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在农业领域表现不佳，需要提高其在精准农业中的可靠性。

Method: 1. 基于提示的专家评估协议；2. 余弦一致性自投票机制，生成并选择语义一致的诊断。

Result: 玉米叶病害识别准确率从82.2%提升至87.8%，症状分析从38.9%提升至52.2%，治疗建议从27.8%提升至43.3%。

Abstract: Precision agriculture relies heavily on accurate image analysis for crop
disease identification and treatment recommendation, yet existing
vision-language models (VLMs) often underperform in specialized agricultural
domains. This work presents a domain-aware framework for agricultural image
processing that combines prompt-based expert evaluation with self-consistency
mechanisms to enhance VLM reliability in precision agriculture applications. We
introduce two key innovations: (1) a prompt-based evaluation protocol that
configures a language model as an expert plant pathologist for scalable
assessment of image analysis outputs, and (2) a cosine-consistency self-voting
mechanism that generates multiple candidate responses from agricultural images
and selects the most semantically coherent diagnosis using domain-adapted
embeddings. Applied to maize leaf disease identification from field images
using a fine-tuned PaliGemma model, our approach improves diagnostic accuracy
from 82.2\% to 87.8\%, symptom analysis from 38.9\% to 52.2\%, and treatment
recommendation from 27.8\% to 43.3\% compared to standard greedy decoding. The
system remains compact enough for deployment on mobile devices, supporting
real-time agricultural decision-making in resource-constrained environments.
These results demonstrate significant potential for AI-driven precision
agriculture tools that can operate reliably in diverse field conditions.

### [4] [Towards Evaluating Robustness of Prompt Adherence in Text to Image Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08039)
*Sujith Vemishetty,Advitiya Arora,Anupama Sharma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种评估文本到图像模型的新框架，重点关注其对提示的遵循能力，并通过实验发现现有模型在生成简单二进制图像时表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态LLM和文本到图像模型的研究相对不足，其可靠性和性能评估缺乏系统性，因此需要建立全面的评估框架。

Method: 创建了一个新数据集，利用GPT-4生成文本描述作为基准，通过文本到图像模型生成图像，再用GPT-4评估生成图像与提示的差异。

Result: 实验表明，模型在生成仅包含简单几何形状和位置的二进制图像时表现不佳，且无法遵循输入数据集的分布。

Conclusion: 现有文本到图像模型在遵循提示和生成特定分布图像方面存在显著不足，需进一步改进。

Abstract: The advancements in the domain of LLMs in recent years have surprised many,
showcasing their remarkable capabilities and diverse applications. Their
potential applications in various real-world scenarios have led to significant
research on their reliability and effectiveness. On the other hand, multimodal
LLMs and Text-to-Image models have only recently gained prominence, especially
when compared to text-only LLMs. Their reliability remains constrained due to
insufficient research on assessing their performance and robustness. This paper
aims to establish a comprehensive evaluation framework for Text-to-Image
models, concentrating particularly on their adherence to prompts. We created a
novel dataset that aimed to assess the robustness of these models in generating
images that conform to the specified factors of variation in the input text
prompts. Our evaluation studies present findings on three variants of Stable
Diffusion models: Stable Diffusion 3 Medium, Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large, and
Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large Turbo, and two variants of Janus models: Janus Pro
1B and Janus Pro 7B. We introduce a pipeline that leverages text descriptions
generated by the gpt-4o model for our ground-truth images, which are then used
to generate artificial images by passing these descriptions to the
Text-to-Image models. We then pass these generated images again through gpt-4o
using the same system prompt and compare the variation between the two
descriptions. Our results reveal that these models struggle to create simple
binary images with only two factors of variation: a simple geometric shape and
its location. We also show, using pre-trained VAEs on our dataset, that they
fail to generate images that follow our input dataset distribution.

### [5] [ConsNoTrainLoRA: Data-driven Weight Initialization of Low-rank Adapters using Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08044)
*Debasmit Das,Hyoungwoo Park,Munawar Hayat,Seokeon Choi,Sungrack Yun,Fatih Porikli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种数据驱动的LoRA权重初始化方法CNTLoRA，通过预训练和微调激活向量的约束关系，无需训练即可初始化权重，显著提升了微调性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LoRA权重初始化方法随机且固定秩，限制了微调效果。本文旨在通过数据驱动的初始化方法提升收敛速度和最终性能。

Method: 将LoRA初始化视为领域偏移问题，利用预训练和微调激活向量的约束关系，推导出闭式权重估计，支持可变秩初始化。

Result: 在图像生成、分类和理解任务中，CNTLoRA优于标准和数据驱动的初始化方法，收敛更快且性能更优。

Conclusion: CNTLoRA通过数据驱动的权重初始化，显著提升了LoRA微调的效果，为高效微调提供了新思路。

Abstract: Foundation models are pre-trained on large-scale datasets and subsequently
fine-tuned on small-scale datasets using parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT)
techniques like low-rank adapters (LoRA). In most previous works, LoRA weight
matrices are randomly initialized with a fixed rank across all attachment
points. In this paper, we improve convergence and final performance of LoRA
fine-tuning, using our proposed data-driven weight initialization method,
ConsNoTrainLoRA (CNTLoRA). We express LoRA initialization as a domain shift
problem where we use multiple constraints relating the pre-training and
fine-tuning activations. By reformulating these constraints, we obtain a
closed-form estimate of LoRA weights that depends on pre-training weights and
fine-tuning activation vectors and hence requires no training during
initialization. This weight estimate is decomposed to initialize the up and
down matrices with proposed flexibility of variable ranks. With the proposed
initialization method, we fine-tune on downstream tasks such as image
generation, image classification and image understanding. Both quantitative and
qualitative results demonstrate that CNTLoRA outperforms standard and
data-driven weight initialization methods. Extensive analyses and ablations
further elucidate the design choices of our framework, providing an optimal
recipe for faster convergence and enhanced performance.

### [6] [A Hybrid Multilayer Extreme Learning Machine for Image Classification with an Application to Quadcopters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08047)
*Rolando A. Hernandez-Hernandez,Adrian Rubio-Solis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于ELM-AE和区间类型2模糊逻辑的混合多层极限学习机（HML-ELM），用于无人机图像分类，表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多层极限学习机（ML-ELM）及其变体在自然信号分类中表现良好，但需要进一步提升效率和性能。

Method: HML-ELM采用两阶段框架：1）自学习特征提取（ELM-AE堆叠），2）监督分类（SIT2-FELM）。

Result: 实验表明，HML-ELM在图像分类和无人机任务中优于ML-ELM、ML-FELM和ELM。

Conclusion: HML-ELM是一种高效且性能优越的分类方法，适用于复杂任务如无人机图像分类。

Abstract: Multilayer Extreme Learning Machine (ML-ELM) and its variants have proven to
be an effective technique for the classification of different natural signals
such as audio, video, acoustic and images. In this paper, a Hybrid Multilayer
Extreme Learning Machine (HML-ELM) that is based on ELM-based autoencoder
(ELM-AE) and an Interval Type-2 fuzzy Logic theory is suggested for active
image classification and applied to Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). The
proposed methodology is a hierarchical ELM learning framework that consists of
two main phases: 1) self-taught feature extraction and 2) supervised feature
classification. First, unsupervised multilayer feature encoding is achieved by
stacking a number of ELM-AEs, in which input data is projected into a number of
high-level representations. At the second phase, the final features are
classified using a novel Simplified Interval Type-2 Fuzzy ELM (SIT2-FELM) with
a fast output reduction layer based on the SC algorithm; an improved version of
the algorithm Center of Sets Type Reducer without Sorting Requirement
(COSTRWSR). To validate the efficiency of the HML-ELM, two types of experiments
for the classification of images are suggested. First, the HML-ELM is applied
to solve a number of benchmark problems for image classification. Secondly, a
number of real experiments to the active classification and transport of four
different objects between two predefined locations using a UAV is implemented.
Experiments demonstrate that the proposed HML-ELM delivers a superior
efficiency compared to other similar methodologies such as ML-ELM, Multilayer
Fuzzy Extreme Learning Machine (ML-FELM) and ELM.

Abstract: Cloud and cloud shadow masking is a crucial preprocessing step in
hyperspectral satellite imaging, enabling the extraction of high-quality,
analysis-ready data. This study evaluates various machine learning approaches,
including gradient boosting methods such as XGBoost and LightGBM as well as
convolutional neural networks (CNNs). All boosting and CNN models achieved
accuracies exceeding 93%. Among the investigated models, the CNN with feature
reduction emerged as the most efficient, offering a balance of high accuracy,
low storage requirements, and rapid inference times on both CPUs and GPUs.
Variations of this version, with only up to 597 trainable parameters,
demonstrated the best trade-off in terms of deployment feasibility, accuracy,
and computational efficiency. These results demonstrate the potential of
lightweight artificial intelligence (AI) models for real-time hyperspectral
image processing, supporting the development of on-board satellite AI systems
for space-based applications.

### [8] [The relative importance of being Gaussian](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08059)
*F. Alberto Grünbaum,Tondgi Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文探讨了在去噪算法中使用非高斯噪声（如均匀分布或Beta分布）的效果，而非修改算法以适应噪声类型。实验在小规模计算设备上进行。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究高斯噪声假设对去噪算法的重要性，以及算法在非高斯噪声下的表现。

Method: 使用原始算法，但替换噪声类型（如均匀分布、Beta分布或混合高斯分布），并在小规模设备上实验。

Result: 观察到算法在非高斯噪声下的性能变化，但未具体说明优劣。

Conclusion: 探索不同噪声类型和计算环境对算法性能的影响是一个有趣的挑战。

Abstract: The remarkable results for denoising in computer vision using diffusion
models given in \cite{SDWMG,HJA,HHG} yield a robust mathematical justification
for algorithms based on crucial properties of a sequence of Gaussian
independent $N(0,1)$ random variables. In particular the derivations use the
fact that a Gaussian distribution is determined by its mean and variance and
that the sum of two Gaussians is another Gaussian.
  \bigskip
  The issue raised in this short note is the following: suppose we use the
algorithm without any changes but replace the nature of the noise and use, for
instance, uniformly distributed noise or noise with a Beta distribution, or
noise which is a random superposition of two Gaussians with very different
variances. One could, of course, try to modify the algorithm keeping in mind
the nature of the noise, but this is not what we do. Instead we study the
performance of the algorithm when used with noise that is very far in nature
from the Gaussian case, where it is designed to work well.
  Usually these algorithms are implemented on very powerful computers. Our
experiments are all carried out on a small laptop and for the smallest possible
image size. Exploring how our observations are confirmed or changed when
dealing in different situations remains an interesting challenge.

### [9] [An Object-Based Deep Learning Approach for Building Height Estimation from Single SAR Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08096)
*Babak Memar,Luigi Russo,Silvia Liberata Ullo,Paolo Gamba*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于深度学习的自动化建筑高度估计方法，使用单张高分辨率SAR图像，通过边界框检测和高度回归实现。模型在多大陆数据集上验证，表现出色，尤其在欧洲城市中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高分辨率SAR图像在建筑高度估计中具有重要应用，但现有方法在跨城市和跨大陆泛化能力上存在不足。本文旨在通过深度学习方法提升泛化性能。

Method: 采用基于边界框检测的物体回归方法，利用单张VHR COSMO-SkyMed SAR图像进行建筑高度估计。模型通过多大陆数据集训练和交叉验证评估。

Result: 模型在欧洲城市表现最佳（如慕尼黑的MAE为2.20米），显著优于现有方法。在亚洲等高楼密集区域泛化能力有所下降，但仍显示出潜力。

Conclusion: 深度学习在单张VHR SAR图像的跨城市和跨大陆建筑高度估计中具有显著潜力，尤其在欧洲城市表现优异。

Abstract: Accurate estimation of building heights using very high resolution (VHR)
synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery is crucial for various urban
applications. This paper introduces a Deep Learning (DL)-based methodology for
automated building height estimation from single VHR COSMO-SkyMed images: an
object-based regression approach based on bounding box detection followed by
height estimation. This model was trained and evaluated on a unique
multi-continental dataset comprising eight geographically diverse cities across
Europe, North and South America, and Asia, employing a cross-validation
strategy to explicitly assess out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. The
results demonstrate highly promising performance, particularly on European
cities where the model achieves a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of approximately
one building story (2.20 m in Munich), significantly outperforming recent
state-of-the-art methods in similar OOD scenarios. Despite the increased
variability observed when generalizing to cities in other continents,
particularly in Asia with its distinct urban typologies and prevalence of
high-rise structures, this study underscores the significant potential of DL
for robust cross-city and cross-continental transfer learning in building
height estimation from single VHR SAR data.

### [10] [RegGS: Unposed Sparse Views Gaussian Splatting with 3DGS Registration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08136)
*Chong Cheng,Yu Hu,Sicheng Yu,Beizhen Zhao,Zijian Wang,Hao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RegGS提出了一种基于3D高斯注册的框架，用于重建无位姿稀疏视图，通过熵正则化的Sinkhorn算法和联合注册模块，实现了高保真的局部高斯对齐和高质量新视角合成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D高斯重建方法在稀疏视图下表现不佳，且前馈高斯方法受限于输入格式，难以整合更多视图。

Method: RegGS利用熵正则化的Sinkhorn算法计算最优传输MW2距离作为对齐度量，并结合光度一致性和深度几何设计联合注册模块。

Result: 在RE10K和ACID数据集上，RegGS实现了高保真的局部高斯对齐、精确的位姿估计和高质量新视角合成。

Conclusion: RegGS有效解决了稀疏视图下的3D高斯重建问题，为无位姿场景重建提供了新思路。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated its potential in reconstructing
scenes from unposed images. However, optimization-based 3DGS methods struggle
with sparse views due to limited prior knowledge. Meanwhile, feed-forward
Gaussian approaches are constrained by input formats, making it challenging to
incorporate more input views. To address these challenges, we propose RegGS, a
3D Gaussian registration-based framework for reconstructing unposed sparse
views. RegGS aligns local 3D Gaussians generated by a feed-forward network into
a globally consistent 3D Gaussian representation. Technically, we implement an
entropy-regularized Sinkhorn algorithm to efficiently solve the optimal
transport Mixture 2-Wasserstein $(\text{MW}_2)$ distance, which serves as an
alignment metric for Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) in $\mathrm{Sim}(3)$ space.
Furthermore, we design a joint 3DGS registration module that integrates the
$\text{MW}_2$ distance, photometric consistency, and depth geometry. This
enables a coarse-to-fine registration process while accurately estimating
camera poses and aligning the scene. Experiments on the RE10K and ACID datasets
demonstrate that RegGS effectively registers local Gaussians with high
fidelity, achieving precise pose estimation and high-quality novel-view
synthesis. Project page: https://3dagentworld.github.io/reggs/.

*Hyungjun Doh,Dong In Lee,Seunggeun Chi,Pin-Hao Huang,Kwonjoon Lee,Sangpil Kim,Karthik Ramani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的单目视频动态人-物交互重建框架，解决了遮挡和时间不一致性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统3D重建方法假设静态物体或动态主体完全可见，导致在遮挡情况下性能下降。

Method: 利用模态补全推断部分遮挡区域的完整结构，结合时间上下文增强视频序列一致性。

Result: 在挑战性单目视频上验证，展示了处理遮挡和时间稳定性的优越性。

Conclusion: 该框架显著提升了动态场景中复杂细节的恢复能力。

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for reconstructing dynamic human-object
interactions from monocular video that overcomes challenges associated with
occlusions and temporal inconsistencies. Traditional 3D reconstruction methods
typically assume static objects or full visibility of dynamic subjects, leading
to degraded performance when these assumptions are violated-particularly in
scenarios where mutual occlusions occur. To address this, our framework
leverages amodal completion to infer the complete structure of partially
obscured regions. Unlike conventional approaches that operate on individual
frames, our method integrates temporal context, enforcing coherence across
video sequences to incrementally refine and stabilize reconstructions. This
template-free strategy adapts to varying conditions without relying on
predefined models, significantly enhancing the recovery of intricate details in
dynamic scenes. We validate our approach using 3D Gaussian Splatting on
challenging monocular videos, demonstrating superior precision in handling
occlusions and maintaining temporal stability compared to existing techniques.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种自适应扩散去噪平滑方法，用于验证视觉模型对抗对抗样本的预测，并适应输入。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过重新解释引导去噪扩散模型为一系列自适应高斯差分隐私机制，提升模型的鲁棒性。

Method: 将引导去噪过程视为自适应GDP机制序列，通过GDP隐私过滤器分析端到端鲁棒性。

Result: 在特定引导策略下，ImageNet上的认证准确率和标准准确率均有所提升。

Conclusion: 该方法为对抗样本提供了可证明的认证，同时提升了模型性能。

Abstract: We propose Adaptive Diffusion Denoised Smoothing, a method for certifying the
predictions of a vision model against adversarial examples, while adapting to
the input. Our key insight is to reinterpret a guided denoising diffusion model
as a long sequence of adaptive Gaussian Differentially Private (GDP) mechanisms
refining a pure noise sample into an image. We show that these adaptive
mechanisms can be composed through a GDP privacy filter to analyze the
end-to-end robustness of the guided denoising process, yielding a provable
certification that extends the adaptive randomized smoothing analysis. We
demonstrate that our design, under a specific guiding strategy, can improve
both certified accuracy and standard accuracy on ImageNet for an $\ell_2$
threat model.

Result: 系统实现了轻量化的实时深度估计和物体检测，mAP50达到0.801。

Conclusion: 该系统能有效帮助视障人士避免碰撞，适用于嵌入式设备部署。

Abstract: Visually impaired people face significant challenges in their day-to-day
commutes in the urban cities of Bangladesh due to the vast number of
obstructions on every path. With many injuries taking place through road
accidents on a daily basis, it is paramount for a system to be developed that
can alert the visually impaired of objects at close distance beforehand. To
overcome this issue, a novel alert system is proposed in this research to
assist the visually impaired in commuting through these busy streets without
colliding with any objects. The proposed system can alert the individual to
objects that are present at a close distance. It utilizes transfer learning to
train models for depth estimation and object detection, and combines both
models to introduce a novel system. The models are optimized through the
utilization of quantization techniques to make them lightweight and efficient,
allowing them to be easily deployed on embedded systems. The proposed solution
achieved a lightweight real-time depth estimation and object detection model
with an mAP50 of 0.801.

### [14] [HNOSeg-XS: Extremely Small Hartley Neural Operator for Efficient and Resolution-Robust 3D Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08205)
*Ken C. L. Wong,Hongzhi Wang,Tanveer Syeda-Mahmood*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种分辨率鲁棒的HNOSeg-XS架构，通过可学习的偏微分方程和Hartley变换解决医学图像分割中CNN和Transformer的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决CNN和Transformer在医学图像分割中因计算成本和内存占用高而导致的输入尺寸限制问题，以及离散训练带来的次优结果。

Method: 采用傅里叶神经算子，通过Hartley变换在频域中建模图像分割问题，构建HNOSeg-XS模型。

Result: 在多个数据集上测试，HNOSeg-XS表现出色，参数少于34.7k，推理时间<0.24秒，内存占用<1.8 GiB。

Conclusion: HNOSeg-XS是一种高效、分辨率鲁棒且参数极少的医学图像分割模型。

Abstract: In medical image segmentation, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and
transformers are dominant. For CNNs, given the local receptive fields of
convolutional layers, long-range spatial correlations are captured through
consecutive convolutions and pooling. However, as the computational cost and
memory footprint can be prohibitively large, 3D models can only afford fewer
layers than 2D models with reduced receptive fields and abstract levels. For
transformers, although long-range correlations can be captured by multi-head
attention, its quadratic complexity with respect to input size is
computationally demanding. Therefore, either model may require input size
reduction to allow more filters and layers for better segmentation.
Nevertheless, given their discrete nature, models trained with patch-wise
training or image downsampling may produce suboptimal results when applied on
higher resolutions. To address this issue, here we propose the
resolution-robust HNOSeg-XS architecture. We model image segmentation by
learnable partial differential equations through the Fourier neural operator
which has the zero-shot super-resolution property. By replacing the Fourier
transform by the Hartley transform and reformulating the problem in the
frequency domain, we created the HNOSeg-XS model, which is resolution robust,
fast, memory efficient, and extremely parameter efficient. When tested on the
BraTS'23, KiTS'23, and MVSeg'23 datasets with a Tesla V100 GPU, HNOSeg-XS
showed its superior resolution robustness with fewer than 34.7k model
parameters. It also achieved the overall best inference time (< 0.24 s) and
memory efficiency (< 1.8 GiB) compared to the tested CNN and transformer
models.

Motivation: 解决StarDist-3D在实例参数化维度与体素分辨率耦合的问题，实现高分辨率预测且无体素化伪影。

Method: 基于StarDist-3D改进，使用双三次Bézier三角形表示封闭曲面，支持任意分辨率上采样。

Result: 在生物医学图像中，SurfDist以更紧凑的参数化优于StarDist-3D，并通过合成和真实数据集验证。

Conclusion: SurfDist证明了可解释的实例表面模型可以与实例成员关系共同有效学习。

Abstract: We present SurfDist, a convolutional neural network architecture for
three-dimensional volumetric instance segmentation. SurfDist enables prediction
of instances represented as closed surfaces composed of smooth parametric
surface patches, specifically bicubic B\'ezier triangles. SurfDist is a
modification of the popular model architecture StarDist-3D which breaks
StarDist-3D's coupling of instance parameterization dimension and instance
voxel resolution, and it produces predictions which may be upsampled to
arbitrarily high resolutions without introduction of voxelization artifacts.
  For datasets with blob-shaped instances, common in biomedical imaging,
SurfDist can outperform StarDist-3D with more compact instance
parameterizations. We detail SurfDist's technical implementation and show one
synthetic and one real-world dataset for which it outperforms StarDist-3D.
These results demonstrate that interpretable instance surface models can be
learned effectively alongside instance membership.

Abstract: Accurate identification of fungi species presents a unique challenge in
computer vision due to fine-grained inter-species variation and high
intra-species variation. This paper presents our approach for the FungiCLEF
2025 competition, which focuses on few-shot fine-grained visual categorization
(FGVC) using the FungiTastic Few-Shot dataset. Our team (DS@GT) experimented
with multiple vision transformer models, data augmentation, weighted sampling,
and incorporating textual information. We also explored generative AI models
for zero-shot classification using structured prompting but found them to
significantly underperform relative to vision-based models. Our final model
outperformed both competition baselines and highlighted the effectiveness of
domain specific pretraining and balanced sampling strategies. Our approach
ranked 35/74 on the private test set in post-completion evaluation, this
suggests additional work can be done on metadata selection and domain-adapted
multi-modal learning. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床实践中缺乏客观测量运动的方法，限制了生物力学测量的广泛应用，PBL旨在填补这一空白。

Method: PBL包括一个安全的云智能手机应用和新型算法，用于拟合生物力学模型，并在神经外科和运动医学诊所测试了其可用性。

Conclusion: 智能手机视频是一种可扩展、低负担的工具，可用于捕获有临床意义的生物力学数据，支持其在临床中的广泛应用。

Abstract: The way a person moves is a direct reflection of their neurological and
musculoskeletal health, yet it remains one of the most underutilized vital
signs in clinical practice. Although clinicians visually observe movement
impairments, they lack accessible and validated methods to objectively measure
movement in routine care. This gap prevents wider use of biomechanical
measurements in practice, which could enable more sensitive outcome measures or
earlier identification of impairment. We present our Portable Biomechanics
Laboratory (PBL), which includes a secure, cloud-enabled smartphone app for
data collection and a novel algorithm for fitting biomechanical models to this
data. We extensively validated PBL's biomechanical measures using a large,
clinically representative dataset. Next, we tested the usability and utility of
our system in neurosurgery and sports medicine clinics. We found joint angle
errors within 3 degrees across participants with neurological injury,
lower-limb prosthesis users, pediatric inpatients, and controls. In addition to
being easy to use, gait metrics computed from the PBL showed high reliability
and were sensitive to clinical differences. For example, in individuals
undergoing decompression surgery for cervical myelopathy, the mJOA score is a
common patient-reported outcome measure; we found that PBL gait metrics
correlated with mJOA scores and demonstrated greater responsiveness to surgical
intervention than the patient-reported outcomes. These findings support the use
of handheld smartphone video as a scalable, low-burden tool for capturing
clinically meaningful biomechanical data, offering a promising path toward
accessible monitoring of mobility impairments. We release the first clinically
validated method for measuring whole-body kinematics from handheld smartphone
video at

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为CR-Net的新方法，结合结构先验和证据学习理论，解决了SAR目标检测中因分辨率差异导致的域适应问题，显著提升了跨分辨率检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着SAR分辨率的提高，散射特性的差异增加，导致目标检测模型的泛化能力下降，传统域适应技术存在盲特征适应和不可靠语义传播的问题。

Method: CR-Net包含结构诱导的层次特征适应（SHFA）模块和可靠结构邻接对齐（RSAA）模块，分别用于结构感知的特征适应和可靠的语义对齐。

Result: 在不同分辨率数据集上的实验表明，CR-Net通过保持域内结构和提升判别能力，显著提升了跨分辨率适应性能，达到了SOTA水平。

Conclusion: CR-Net通过结合结构先验和证据学习理论，有效解决了跨分辨率SAR目标检测中的域适应问题，为相关应用提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: In recent years, continuous improvements in SAR resolution have significantly
benefited applications such as urban monitoring and target detection. However,
the improvement in resolution leads to increased discrepancies in scattering
characteristics, posing challenges to the generalization ability of target
detection models. While domain adaptation technology is a potential solution,
the inevitable discrepancies caused by resolution differences often lead to
blind feature adaptation and unreliable semantic propagation, ultimately
degrading the domain adaptation performance. To address these challenges, this
paper proposes a novel SAR target detection method (termed CR-Net), that
incorporates structure priors and evidential learning theory into the detection
model, enabling reliable domain adaptation for cross-resolution detection. To
be specific, CR-Net integrates Structure-induced Hierarchical Feature
Adaptation (SHFA) and Reliable Structural Adjacency Alignment (RSAA). SHFA
module is introduced to establish structural correlations between targets and
achieve structure-aware feature adaptation, thereby enhancing the
interpretability of the feature adaptation process. Afterwards, the RSAA module
is proposed to enhance reliable semantic alignment, by leveraging the secure
adjacency set to transfer valuable discriminative knowledge from the source
domain to the target domain. This further improves the discriminability of the
detection model in the target domain. Based on experimental results from
different-resolution datasets,the proposed CR-Net significantly enhances
cross-resolution adaptation by preserving intra-domain structures and improving
discriminability. It achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in
cross-resolution SAR target detection.

Motivation: 现有3D方法在运动建模和内容合成中存在渲染伪影（如运动模糊、时间抖动和局部穿透），需要更稳定的细粒度运动表示。

Method: 提出三步框架：视频预处理、运动表示和渲染重建；采用多粒度运动解耦策略独立建模非刚性和刚性运动，并设计交替优化策略迭代细化参数。

Abstract: Audio-driven talking head generation holds significant potential for film
production. While existing 3D methods have advanced motion modeling and content
synthesis, they often produce rendering artifacts, such as motion blur,
temporal jitter, and local penetration, due to limitations in representing
stable, fine-grained motion fields. Through systematic analysis, we reformulate
talking head generation into a unified framework comprising three steps: video
preprocessing, motion representation, and rendering reconstruction. This
framework underpins our proposed M2DAO-Talker, which addresses current
limitations via multi-granular motion decoupling and alternating
optimization.Specifically, we devise a novel 2D portrait preprocessing pipeline
to extract frame-wise deformation control conditions (motion region
segmentation masks, and camera parameters) to facilitate motion representation.
To ameliorate motion modeling, we elaborate a multi-granular motion decoupling
strategy, which independently models non-rigid (oral and facial) and rigid
(head) motions for improved reconstruction accuracy.Meanwhile, a motion
consistency constraint is developed to ensure head-torso kinematic consistency,
thereby mitigating penetration artifacts caused by motion aliasing. In
addition, an alternating optimization strategy is designed to iteratively
refine facial and oral motion parameters, enabling more realistic video
generation.Experiments across multiple datasets show that M2DAO-Talker achieves
state-of-the-art performance, with the 2.43 dB PSNR improvement in generation
quality and 0.64 gain in user-evaluated video realness versus TalkingGaussian
while with 150 FPS inference speed. Our project homepage is

Abstract: Craniofacial reconstruction in forensic science is crucial for the
identification of the victims of crimes and disasters. The objective is to map
a given skull to its corresponding face in a corpus of faces with known
identities using recent advancements in computer vision, such as deep learning.
In this paper, we presented a framework for the identification of a person
given the X-ray image of a skull using convolutional Siamese networks for
cross-domain identity representation. Siamese networks are twin networks that
share the same architecture and can be trained to discover a feature space
where nearby observations that are similar are grouped and dissimilar
observations are moved apart. To do this, the network is exposed to two sets of
comparable and different data. The Euclidean distance is then minimized between
similar pairs and maximized between dissimilar ones. Since getting pairs of
skull and face images are difficult, we prepared our own dataset of 40
volunteers whose front and side skull X-ray images and optical face images were
collected. Experiments were conducted on the collected cross-domain dataset to
train and validate the Siamese networks. The experimental results provide
satisfactory results on the identification of a person from the given skull.

Motivation: 深度学习在医学图像分析中取得了显著进展，但其在临床实践中的应用受到模型规模大和缺乏透明度的限制。

Method: 通过选择性保留每层中最相关的部分，实现有针对性的压缩，同时保持临床意义的表示。

Result: 在多个医学图像分类基准测试中，该方法实现了高压缩率且准确性损失最小。

Conclusion: 该方法为医疗环境中轻量级、可解释的模型的实际部署铺平了道路。

Abstract: Deep learning has driven significant advances in medical image analysis, yet
its adoption in clinical practice remains constrained by the large size and
lack of transparency in modern models. Advances in interpretability techniques
such as DL-Backtrace, Layer-wise Relevance Propagation, and Integrated
Gradients make it possible to assess the contribution of individual components
within neural networks trained on medical imaging tasks. In this work, we
introduce an interpretability-guided pruning framework that reduces model
complexity while preserving both predictive performance and transparency. By
selectively retaining only the most relevant parts of each layer, our method
enables targeted compression that maintains clinically meaningful
representations. Experiments across multiple medical image classification
benchmarks demonstrate that this approach achieves high compression rates with
minimal loss in accuracy, paving the way for lightweight, interpretable models
suited for real-world deployment in healthcare settings.

Motivation: 传统生成概念瓶颈模型依赖辅助视觉线索，损害了可解释性和组合性。

Method: 提出CoCo-Bot，利用扩散能量函数支持后处理干预（如概念组合和否定），完全通过显式概念传递信息。

Result: 在CelebA-HQ数据集上实验表明，CoCo-Bot提升了概念级可控性和可解释性，同时保持视觉质量。

Conclusion: CoCo-Bot通过消除辅助线索，显著改善了生成模型的可解释性和组合性。

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) provide interpretable and controllable
generative modeling by routing generation through explicit,
human-understandable concepts. However, previous generative CBMs often rely on
auxiliary visual cues at the bottleneck to compensate for information not
captured by the concepts, which undermines interpretability and
compositionality. We propose CoCo-Bot, a post-hoc, composable concept
bottleneck generative model that eliminates the need for auxiliary cues by
transmitting all information solely through explicit concepts. Guided by
diffusion-based energy functions, CoCo-Bot supports robust post-hoc
interventions-such as concept composition and negation-across arbitrary
concepts. Experiments using StyleGAN2 pre-trained on CelebA-HQ show that
CoCo-Bot improves concept-level controllability and interpretability, while
maintaining competitive visual quality.

Result: 在四种癌症类型的基准测试中，模型表现出优异的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 为跨癌症多模态预后提供了实用且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Deep learning has shown remarkable performance in integrating multimodal data
for survival prediction. However, existing multimodal methods mainly focus on
single cancer types and overlook the challenge of generalization across
cancers. In this work, we are the first to reveal that multimodal prognosis
models often generalize worse than unimodal ones in cross-cancer scenarios,
despite the critical need for such robustness in clinical practice. To address
this, we propose a new task: Cross-Cancer Single Domain Generalization for
Multimodal Prognosis, which evaluates whether models trained on a single cancer
type can generalize to unseen cancers. We identify two key challenges: degraded
features from weaker modalities and ineffective multimodal integration. To
tackle these, we introduce two plug-and-play modules: Sparse Dirac Information
Rebalancer (SDIR) and Cancer-aware Distribution Entanglement (CADE). SDIR
mitigates the dominance of strong features by applying Bernoulli-based
sparsification and Dirac-inspired stabilization to enhance weaker modality
signals. CADE, designed to synthesize the target domain distribution, fuses
local morphological cues and global gene expression in latent space.
Experiments on a four-cancer-type benchmark demonstrate superior
generalization, laying the foundation for practical, robust cross-cancer
multimodal prognosis. Code is available at

Conclusion: MRAG通过多范围表示和对抗性扰动，显著提升了隐写术的抗检测能力和隐蔽性。

Abstract: Deep hiding has been exploring the hiding capability of deep learning-based
models, aiming to conceal image-level messages into cover images and reveal
them from generated stego images. Existing schemes are easily detected by
steganalyzers due to their large payloads and their limitation to feature
extraction based solely on either pure convolution or pure transformer
operators within a single range, as well as pixel-level loss constraints. To
address the issue, in this paper, we introduce generation-based adversarial
attacks into color JPEG image deep hiding and propose a multi-range
representations-driven adversarial stego generation framework called MRAG from
a steganalysis perspective. Specifically, we integrate the local-range neighbor
reception characteristic of the convolution and the global-range dependency
modeling of the transformer to construct MRAG. Meanwhile, we use the
transformed images obtained through coarse-grained and fine-grained frequency
decomposition as inputs, introducing multi-grained information. Furthermore, a
features angle-norm disentanglement loss is designed to constrain the generated
stegos closer to covers in the angle and norm space of the steganalyzer's
classified features. Consequently, small yet effective adversarial
perturbations can be injected into the process of generating stegos, ensuring
that stegos maintain favorable secret restorability and imperceptibility.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that MRAG can achieve state-of-the-art
performance.

Motivation: 在临床场景中，由于标注医学图像的稀缺性和计算成本，选择最优的上下文图像对并微调基础模型具有挑战性。CCV旨在通过自验证机制提升分割性能。

Method: CCV采用循环流程：首先生成查询图像的分割掩码，随后交换查询图像和上下文图像对的角色以验证预测准确性，并通过查询特定提示优化对齐。

Result: 在七个医学图像分割数据集上的实验表明，CCV优于现有方法，显著提升了基于上下文学习的分割性能。

Conclusion: CCV是一种鲁棒的解决方案，能够有效增强上下文学习在通用医学图像分割中的应用。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) is emerging as a promising technique for achieving
universal medical image segmentation, where a variety of objects of interest
across imaging modalities can be segmented using a single model. Nevertheless,
its performance is highly sensitive to the alignment between the query image
and in-context image-mask pairs. In a clinical scenario, the scarcity of
annotated medical images makes it challenging to select optimal in-context
pairs, and fine-tuning foundation ICL models on contextual data is infeasible
due to computational costs and the risk of catastrophic forgetting. To address
this challenge, we propose Cycle Context Verification (CCV), a novel framework
that enhances ICL-based medical image segmentation by enabling
self-verification of predictions and accordingly enhancing contextual
alignment. Specifically, CCV employs a cyclic pipeline in which the model
initially generates a segmentation mask for the query image. Subsequently, the
roles of the query and an in-context pair are swapped, allowing the model to
validate its prediction by predicting the mask of the original in-context
image. The accuracy of this secondary prediction serves as an implicit measure
of the initial query segmentation. A query-specific prompt is introduced to
alter the query image and updated to improve the measure, thereby enhancing the
alignment between the query and in-context pairs. We evaluated CCV on seven
medical image segmentation datasets using two ICL foundation models,
demonstrating its superiority over existing methods. Our results highlight
CCV's ability to enhance ICL-based segmentation, making it a robust solution
for universal medical image segmentation. The code will be available at

Motivation: 探索大语言模型在交通场景理解中的潜力，尤其是针对老年驾驶员评估任务，以提升驾驶风险评估的辅助工具。

Method: 采用零样本、少样本和多样本提示策略，评估模型性能，以人类标注为参考标准，使用精确率、召回率和F1分数作为指标。

Result: 提示设计显著提升性能，如交叉口可见性召回率从21.7%提升至57.0%。模型在停车标志检测中表现出高精确率（86.3%）但召回率较低（76.7%）。

Conclusion: 通过优化提示设计，大语言模型有望成为驾驶风险评估的辅助工具，未来需进一步研究数据扩展和模型架构改进。

Abstract: This study investigates the potential of a multimodal large language model
(LLM), specifically ChatGPT-4o, to perform human-like interpretations of
traffic scenes using static dashcam images. Herein, we focus on three judgment
tasks relevant to elderly driver assessments: evaluating traffic density,
assessing intersection visibility, and recognizing stop signs recognition.
These tasks require contextual reasoning rather than simple object detection.
Using zero-shot, few-shot, and multi-shot prompting strategies, we evaluated
the performance of the model with human annotations serving as the reference
standard. Evaluation metrics included precision, recall, and F1-score. Results
indicate that prompt design considerably affects performance, with recall for
intersection visibility increasing from 21.7% (zero-shot) to 57.0%
(multi-shot). For traffic density, agreement increased from 53.5% to 67.6%. In
stop-sign detection, the model demonstrated high precision (up to 86.3%) but a
lower recall (approximately 76.7%), indicating a conservative response
tendency. Output stability analysis revealed that humans and the model faced
difficulties interpreting structurally ambiguous scenes. However, the model's
explanatory texts corresponded with its predictions, enhancing
interpretability. These findings suggest that, with well-designed prompts, LLMs
hold promise as supportive tools for scene-level driving risk assessments.
Future studies should explore scalability using larger datasets, diverse
annotators, and next-generation model architectures for elderly driver
assessments.

Conclusion: GEFU框架有效统一了低光增强与理解，提升了泛化性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Low-level enhancement and high-level visual understanding in low-light vision
have traditionally been treated separately. Low-light enhancement improves
image quality for downstream tasks, but existing methods rely on physical or
geometric priors, limiting generalization. Evaluation mainly focuses on visual
quality rather than downstream performance. Low-light visual understanding,
constrained by scarce labeled data, primarily uses task-specific domain
adaptation, which lacks scalability. To address these challenges, we build a
generalized bridge between low-light enhancement and low-light understanding,
which we term Generalized Enhancement For Understanding (GEFU). This paradigm
improves both generalization and scalability. To address the diverse causes of
low-light degradation, we leverage pretrained generative diffusion models to
optimize images, achieving zero-shot generalization performance. Building on
this, we propose Semantically Consistent Unsupervised Fine-tuning (SCUF).
Specifically, to overcome text prompt limitations, we introduce an
illumination-aware image prompt to explicitly guide image generation and
propose a cycle-attention adapter to maximize its semantic potential. To
mitigate semantic degradation in unsupervised training, we propose caption and
reflectance consistency to learn high-level semantics and image-level spatial
semantics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method
outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in traditional image quality and
GEFU tasks including classification, detection, and semantic segmentation.

Method: 提出ODOR数据集，包含4712张图像的38,116个对象级标注，涵盖139个细粒度类别，并进行统计分析和基线模型评估。

Result: 数据集展示了细粒度类别、密集重叠对象和全画布空间分布等挑战性特性，并通过基线分析验证了其难度。

Conclusion: ODOR数据集为艺术对象检测和视觉文化遗产研究提供了新挑战，鼓励探索对象识别与嗅觉感知的交叉研究。

Abstract: Real-world applications of computer vision in the humanities require
algorithms to be robust against artistic abstraction, peripheral objects, and
subtle differences between fine-grained target classes. Existing datasets
provide instance-level annotations on artworks but are generally biased towards
the image centre and limited with regard to detailed object classes. The
proposed ODOR dataset fills this gap, offering 38,116 object-level annotations
across 4712 images, spanning an extensive set of 139 fine-grained categories.
Conducting a statistical analysis, we showcase challenging dataset properties,
such as a detailed set of categories, dense and overlapping objects, and
spatial distribution over the whole image canvas. Furthermore, we provide an
extensive baseline analysis for object detection models and highlight the
challenging properties of the dataset through a set of secondary studies.
Inspiring further research on artwork object detection and broader visual
cultural heritage studies, the dataset challenges researchers to explore the
intersection of object recognition and smell perception.

Motivation: 现有方法在保持主题一致性时牺牲了布局和姿势多样性，限制了视觉表达的丰富性。

Method: 采用身份传输（IT）和身份细化（IR）两阶段策略，分别处理早期和后期去噪步骤，以平衡一致性与多样性。

Result: 在主题一致性、姿势多样性和提示保真度方面均表现出色，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CoDi框架在保持主题一致性的同时实现了姿势多样性，为视觉叙事提供了更丰富的表达方式。

Abstract: Subject-consistent generation (SCG)-aiming to maintain a consistent subject
identity across diverse scenes-remains a challenge for text-to-image (T2I)
models. Existing training-free SCG methods often achieve consistency at the
cost of layout and pose diversity, hindering expressive visual storytelling. To
address the limitation, we propose subject-Consistent and pose-Diverse T2I
framework, dubbed as CoDi, that enables consistent subject generation with
diverse pose and layout. Motivated by the progressive nature of diffusion,
where coarse structures emerge early and fine details are refined later, CoDi
adopts a two-stage strategy: Identity Transport (IT) and Identity Refinement
(IR). IT operates in the early denoising steps, using optimal transport to
transfer identity features to each target image in a pose-aware manner. This
promotes subject consistency while preserving pose diversity. IR is applied in
the later denoising steps, selecting the most salient identity features to
further refine subject details. Extensive qualitative and quantitative results
on subject consistency, pose diversity, and prompt fidelity demonstrate that
CoDi achieves both better visual perception and stronger performance across all
metrics. The code is provided in https://github.com/NJU-PCALab/CoDi.

TL;DR: PanMatch是一个通用的基础模型，用于鲁棒的对应匹配，通过2D位移估计框架统一处理多种任务，无需任务特定架构或微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖任务特定架构和领域微调，PanMatch旨在通过统一框架和通用特征提取器实现多任务集成。

Method: 提出基于2D位移估计的统一框架，利用大型视觉模型的特征提取和跨领域数据集预训练。

Result: PanMatch在跨任务评估中优于UniMatch和Flow-Anything，在异常场景下表现优异。

Conclusion: PanMatch展示了通用性和鲁棒性，适用于多种任务和场景。

Abstract: This work presents PanMatch, a versatile foundation model for robust
correspondence matching. Unlike previous methods that rely on task-specific
architectures and domain-specific fine-tuning to support tasks like stereo
matching, optical flow or feature matching, our key insight is that any
two-frame correspondence matching task can be addressed within a 2D
displacement estimation framework using the same model weights. Such a
formulation eliminates the need for designing specialized unified architectures
or task-specific ensemble models. Instead, it achieves multi-task integration
by endowing displacement estimation algorithms with unprecedented
generalization capabilities. To this end, we highlight the importance of a
robust feature extractor applicable across multiple domains and tasks, and
propose the feature transformation pipeline that leverage all-purpose features
from Large Vision Models to endow matching baselines with zero-shot cross-view
matching capabilities. Furthermore, we assemble a cross-domain dataset with
near 1.8 million samples from stereo matching, optical flow, and feature
matching domains to pretrain PanMatch. We demonstrate the versatility of
PanMatch across a wide range of domains and downstream tasks using the same
model weights. Our model outperforms UniMatch and Flow-Anything on cross-task
evaluations, and achieves comparable performance to most state-of-the-art
task-specific algorithms on task-oriented benchmarks. Additionally, PanMatch
presents unprecedented zero-shot performance in abnormal scenarios, such as
rainy day and satellite imagery, where most existing robust algorithms fail to
yield meaningful results.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖数据无关算法生成哈希中心，忽略了类间语义关系，可能影响检索性能。

Method: 提出三阶段框架SHC：1）分类网络识别语义相似性；2）优化算法生成语义哈希中心；3）深度哈希网络训练生成哈希码。

Result: 在多个公开数据集上，SHC在MAP@100、MAP@1000和MAP@ALL指标上分别平均提升7.26%、7.62%和11.71%。

Conclusion: SHC通过保留语义结构显著提升了检索性能，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Deep hashing is an effective approach for large-scale image retrieval.
Current methods are typically classified by their supervision types:
point-wise, pair-wise, and list-wise. Recent point-wise techniques (e.g., CSQ,
MDS) have improved retrieval performance by pre-assigning a hash center to each
class, enhancing the discriminability of hash codes across various datasets.
However, these methods rely on data-independent algorithms to generate hash
centers, which neglect the semantic relationships between classes and may
degrade retrieval performance.
  This paper introduces the concept of semantic hash centers, building on the
idea of traditional hash centers. We hypothesize that hash centers of
semantically related classes should have closer Hamming distances, while those
of unrelated classes should be more distant. To this end, we propose a
three-stage framework, SHC, to generate hash codes that preserve semantic
structure.
  First, we develop a classification network to identify semantic similarities
between classes using a data-dependent similarity calculation that adapts to
varying data distributions. Second, we introduce an optimization algorithm to
generate semantic hash centers, preserving semantic relatedness while enforcing
a minimum distance between centers to avoid excessively similar hash codes.
Finally, a deep hashing network is trained using these semantic centers to
convert images into binary hash codes.
  Experimental results on large-scale retrieval tasks across several public
datasets show that SHC significantly improves retrieval performance.
Specifically, SHC achieves average improvements of +7.26%, +7.62%, and +11.71%
in MAP@100, MAP@1000, and MAP@ALL metrics, respectively, over state-of-the-art
methods.

TL;DR: MuGCP提出了一种多模态条件提示学习框架，通过语义和视觉条件提示增强视觉语言模型的泛化能力和跨模态对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有提示学习方法在类嵌入分布建模和跨模态对齐上的不足，提升模型在新类别上的泛化能力。

Method: 利用多模态大语言模型生成语义条件提示（SCP），引入注意力互导模块（AMG）生成视觉条件提示（VCP），并通过多提示融合机制（MPF）整合提示。

Result: 在14个数据集上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MuGCP通过多模态条件提示学习有效提升了视觉语言模型的性能。

Abstract: Prompt learning facilitates the efficient adaptation of Vision-Language
Models (VLMs) to various downstream tasks. However, it faces two significant
challenges: (1) inadequate modeling of class embedding distributions for unseen
instances, leading to suboptimal generalization on novel classes; (2)
prevailing methodologies predominantly confine cross-modal alignment to the
final output layer of vision and text encoders, which fundamentally limits
their capacity to preserve topological consistency with pre-trained multi-modal
embedding spaces. To this end, we introduce MuGCP (Multi-modal Mutual-Guidance
Conditional Prompt Learning), a novel paradigm designed for conditional prompt
generation. MuGCP leverages Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) as
conditional prompt learners to adaptively generate Semantic Conditional Prompts
(SCP) that incorporate rich, fine-grained high-level semantic knowledge for
image instances. To ensure effective alignment and interaction across the
multi-modal space of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), we introduce the Attention
Mutual-Guidance (AMG) module, which facilitates interactions between visual and
semantic information. Through mutual guidance, the AMG module generates Visual
Conditional Prompts (VCP), enhancing the model's performance in multi-modal
tasks. Additionally, we present a Multi-Prompt Fusion (MPF) mechanism that
integrates SCP and VCP with contextual prompts, ensuring seamless coordination
among the different prompts and enhancing the modeling of class embeddings and
instance-specific knowledge. Our MuGCP outperforms existing state-of-the-art
methods on 14 different datasets. The code will be made available after
publication.

TL;DR: InstaScene提出了一种新的3D感知范式，旨在分解复杂场景中的实例并实现完整重建，通过空间对比学习和原位生成技术显著提升了分解和重建效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类能自然识别和补全遮挡物体，但机器人缺乏类似能力，现有技术将场景视为整体，无法从部分观察中识别完整物体。

Method: 开发了空间对比学习技术，通过追踪实例在多视图中的栅格化实现精确分解；引入原位生成技术，利用观察和几何线索指导3D生成模型完成实例重建。

Result: 在真实和合成场景的分解与补全实验中，方法表现出更高的分解精度，并能生成几何准确且视觉完整的物体。

Conclusion: InstaScene为复杂场景的3D感知提供了新思路，解决了分解和补全的关键挑战。

Abstract: Humans can naturally identify and mentally complete occluded objects in
cluttered environments. However, imparting similar cognitive ability to
robotics remains challenging even with advanced reconstruction techniques,
which models scenes as undifferentiated wholes and fails to recognize complete
object from partial observations. In this paper, we propose InstaScene, a new
paradigm towards holistic 3D perception of complex scenes with a primary goal:
decomposing arbitrary instances while ensuring complete reconstruction. To
achieve precise decomposition, we develop a novel spatial contrastive learning
by tracing rasterization of each instance across views, significantly enhancing
semantic supervision in cluttered scenes. To overcome incompleteness from
limited observations, we introduce in-situ generation that harnesses valuable
observations and geometric cues, effectively guiding 3D generative models to
reconstruct complete instances that seamlessly align with the real world.
Experiments on scene decomposition and object completion across complex
real-world and synthetic scenes demonstrate that our method achieves superior
decomposition accuracy while producing geometrically faithful and visually
intact objects.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为RALU的训练免费框架，通过空间维度加速扩散变换器的推理，显著减少计算量并保持图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散变换器在高保真图像和视频生成中表现出色，但计算量大阻碍了实际应用。现有加速方法主要利用时间维度，而RALU则从空间维度入手。

Method: RALU采用三阶段混合分辨率采样：低分辨率去噪、区域自适应上采样和全分辨率细节细化，并通过噪声时间步重调度稳定分辨率转换。

Result: 在FLUX上实现7.0倍加速，Stable Diffusion 3上实现3.0倍加速，且图像质量下降最小。

Conclusion: RALU与现有时间加速方法互补，可无缝集成进一步降低推理延迟而不影响生成质量。

Abstract: Diffusion transformers have emerged as an alternative to U-net-based
diffusion models for high-fidelity image and video generation, offering
superior scalability. However, their heavy computation remains a major obstacle
to real-world deployment. Existing acceleration methods primarily exploit the
temporal dimension such as reusing cached features across diffusion timesteps.
Here, we propose Region-Adaptive Latent Upsampling (RALU), a training-free
framework that accelerates inference along spatial dimension. RALU performs
mixed-resolution sampling across three stages: 1) low-resolution denoising
latent diffusion to efficiently capture global semantic structure, 2)
region-adaptive upsampling on specific regions prone to artifacts at
full-resolution, and 3) all latent upsampling at full-resolution for detail
refinement. To stabilize generations across resolution transitions, we leverage
noise-timestep rescheduling to adapt the noise level across varying
resolutions. Our method significantly reduces computation while preserving
image quality by achieving up to 7.0$\times$ speed-up on FLUX and 3.0$\times$
on Stable Diffusion 3 with minimal degradation. Furthermore, RALU is
complementary to existing temporal accelerations such as caching methods, thus
can be seamlessly integrated to further reduce inference latency without
compromising generation quality.

Conclusion: 该方法在复杂场景中实现了更真实且一致的修复效果。

Abstract: Radiance field methods, such as Neural Radiance Field or 3D Gaussian
Splatting, have emerged as seminal 3D representations for synthesizing
realistic novel views. For practical applications, there is ongoing research on
flexible scene editing techniques, among which object removal is a
representative task. However, removing objects exposes occluded regions, often
leading to unnatural appearances. Thus, studies have employed image inpainting
techniques to replace such regions with plausible content - a task referred to
as 3D scene inpainting. However, image inpainting methods produce one of many
plausible completions for each view, leading to inconsistencies between
viewpoints. A widely adopted approach leverages perceptual cues to blend
inpainted views smoothly. However, it is prone to detail loss and can fail when
there are perceptual inconsistencies across views. In this paper, we propose a
novel 3D scene inpainting method that reliably produces realistic and
perceptually consistent results even for complex scenes by leveraging a
reference view. Given the inpainted reference view, we estimate the inpainting
similarity of the other views to adjust their contribution in constructing an
accurate geometry tailored to the reference. This geometry is then used to warp
the reference inpainting to other views as pseudo-ground truth, guiding the
optimization to match the reference appearance. Comparative evaluation studies
have shown that our approach improves both the geometric fidelity and
appearance consistency of inpainted scenes.

Conclusion: VFMTok通过创新设计实现了高效图像分词，为相关领域提供了新工具。

Abstract: Leveraging the powerful representations of pre-trained vision foundation
models -- traditionally used for visual comprehension -- we explore a novel
direction: building an image tokenizer directly atop such models, a largely
underexplored area. Specifically, we employ a frozen vision foundation model as
the encoder of our tokenizer. To enhance its effectiveness, we introduce two
key components: (1) a region-adaptive quantization framework that reduces
redundancy in the pre-trained features on regular 2D grids, and (2) a semantic
reconstruction objective that aligns the tokenizer's outputs with the
foundation model's representations to preserve semantic fidelity. Based on
these designs, our proposed image tokenizer, VFMTok, achieves substantial
improvements in image reconstruction and generation quality, while also
enhancing token efficiency. It further boosts autoregressive (AR) generation --
achieving a gFID of 2.07 on ImageNet benchmarks, while accelerating model
convergence by three times, and enabling high-fidelity class-conditional
synthesis without the need for classifier-free guidance (CFG). The code will be
released publicly to benefit the community.

Conclusion: 深度学习为3D重建带来革命性进展，未来需解决模型精度、可扩展性等问题。

Abstract: 3D reconstruction, which aims to recover the dense three-dimensional
structure of a scene, is a cornerstone technology for numerous applications,
including augmented/virtual reality, autonomous driving, and robotics. While
traditional pipelines like Structure from Motion (SfM) and Multi-View Stereo
(MVS) achieve high precision through iterative optimization, they are limited
by complex workflows, high computational cost, and poor robustness in
challenging scenarios like texture-less regions. Recently, deep learning has
catalyzed a paradigm shift in 3D reconstruction. A new family of models,
exemplified by DUSt3R, has pioneered a feed-forward approach. These models
employ a unified deep network to jointly infer camera poses and dense geometry
directly from an Unconstrained set of images in a single forward pass. This
survey provides a systematic review of this emerging domain. We begin by
dissecting the technical framework of these feed-forward models, including
their Transformer-based correspondence modeling, joint pose and geometry
regression mechanisms, and strategies for scaling from two-view to multi-view
scenarios. To highlight the disruptive nature of this new paradigm, we contrast
it with both traditional pipelines and earlier learning-based methods like
MVSNet. Furthermore, we provide an overview of relevant datasets and evaluation
metrics. Finally, we discuss the technology's broad application prospects and
identify key future challenges and opportunities, such as model accuracy and
scalability, and handling dynamic scenes.

Result: 实验证明该方法在复杂记录结构（如乐谱、工程图）中有效，首次实现端到端工程图转录。

Conclusion: 该方法为未来文档基础模型设计提供了统一框架，适用于非标准文档类型的识别。

Abstract: Many document types use intrinsic, convention-driven structures that serve to
encode precise and structured information, such as the conventions governing
engineering drawings. However, state-of-the-art approaches treat document
recognition as a mere computer vision problem, neglecting these underlying
document-type-specific structural properties, making them dependent on
sub-optimal heuristic post-processing and rendering many less frequent or more
complicated document types inaccessible to modern document recognition. We
suggest a novel perspective that frames document recognition as a transcription
task from a document to a record. This implies a natural grouping of documents
based on the intrinsic structure inherent in their transcription, where related
document types can be treated (and learned) similarly. We propose a method to
design structure-specific inductive biases for the underlying machine-learned
end-to-end document recognition systems, and a respective base transformer
architecture that we successfully adapt to different structures. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of the so-found inductive biases in extensive experiments
with progressively complex record structures from monophonic sheet music, shape
drawings, and simplified engineering drawings. By integrating an inductive bias
for unrestricted graph structures, we train the first-ever successful
end-to-end model to transcribe engineering drawings to their inherently
interlinked information. Our approach is relevant to inform the design of
document recognition systems for document types that are less well understood
than standard OCR, OMR, etc., and serves as a guide to unify the design of
future document foundation models.

Abstract: F3-Net is a foundation model designed to overcome persistent challenges in
clinical medical image segmentation, including reliance on complete multimodal
inputs, limited generalizability, and narrow task specificity. Through flexible
synthetic modality training, F3-Net maintains robust performance even in the
presence of missing MRI sequences, leveraging a zero-image strategy to
substitute absent modalities without relying on explicit synthesis networks,
thereby enhancing real-world applicability. Its unified architecture supports
multi-pathology segmentation across glioma, metastasis, stroke, and white
matter lesions without retraining, outperforming CNN-based and
transformer-based models that typically require disease-specific fine-tuning.
Evaluated on diverse datasets such as BraTS 2021, BraTS 2024, and ISLES 2022,
F3-Net demonstrates strong resilience to domain shifts and clinical
heterogeneity. On the whole pathology dataset, F3-Net achieves average Dice

Abstract: Document image dewarping remains a challenging task in the deep learning era.
While existing methods have improved by leveraging text line awareness, they
typically focus only on a single horizontal dimension. In this paper, we
propose a fine-grained deformation perception model that focuses on Dual
Dimensions of document horizontal-vertical-lines to improve document Dewarping
called D2Dewarp. It can perceive distortion trends in different directions
across document details. To combine the horizontal and vertical granularity
features, an effective fusion module based on X and Y coordinate is designed to
facilitate interaction and constraint between the two dimensions for feature
complementarity. Due to the lack of annotated line features in current public
dewarping datasets, we also propose an automatic fine-grained annotation method
using public document texture images and an automatic rendering engine to build
a new large-scale distortion training dataset. The code and dataset will be
publicly released. On public Chinese and English benchmarks, both quantitative
and qualitative results show that our method achieves better rectification
results compared with the state-of-the-art methods. The dataset will be

Abstract: Occluded person re-identification aims to retrieve holistic images based on
occluded ones. Existing methods often rely on aligning visible body parts,
applying occlusion augmentation, or complementing missing semantics using
holistic images. However, they face challenges in handling diverse occlusion
scenarios not seen during training and the issue of feature contamination from
holistic images. To address these limitations, we propose Occlusion-Guided
Feature Purification Learning via Reinforced Knowledge Distillation (OGFR),
which simultaneously mitigates these challenges. OGFR adopts a teacher-student
distillation architecture that effectively incorporates diverse occlusion
patterns into feature representation while transferring the purified
discriminative holistic knowledge from the holistic to the occluded branch
through reinforced knowledge distillation. Specifically, an Occlusion-Aware
Vision Transformer is designed to leverage learnable occlusion pattern
embeddings to explicitly model such diverse occlusion types, thereby guiding
occlusion-aware robust feature representation. Moreover, we devise a Feature
Erasing and Purification Module within the holistic branch, in which an agent
is employed to identify low-quality patch tokens of holistic images that
contain noisy negative information via deep reinforcement learning, and
substitute these patch tokens with learnable embedding tokens to avoid feature
contamination and further excavate identity-related discriminative clues.
Afterward, with the assistance of knowledge distillation, the student branch
effectively absorbs the purified holistic knowledge to precisely learn robust
representation regardless of the interference of occlusions.

*Inye Na,Nejung Rue,Jiwon Chung,Hyunjin Park*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RadiomicsRetrieval是一个基于3D内容的医学图像检索框架，结合手工设计的放射组学特征和深度学习嵌入，支持灵活查询。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前医学图像检索方法主要支持2D图像且需要完全标注的查询，限制了临床灵活性。

Method: 提出RadiomicsRetrieval框架，利用可提示分割模型（如SAM）生成肿瘤特异性图像嵌入，并通过对比学习与放射组学特征对齐，同时引入解剖位置嵌入（APE）。

Result: 在肺CT和脑MRI数据集上的实验表明，放射组学特征显著提高了检索特异性，APE为基于位置的搜索提供了全局解剖背景。

Conclusion: RadiomicsRetrieval仅需最小用户提示（如单点），支持灵活查询，适用于诊断、治疗计划和大规模医学影像研究。

Abstract: Medical image retrieval is a valuable field for supporting clinical
decision-making, yet current methods primarily support 2D images and require
fully annotated queries, limiting clinical flexibility. To address this, we
propose RadiomicsRetrieval, a 3D content-based retrieval framework bridging
handcrafted radiomics descriptors with deep learning-based embeddings at the
tumor level. Unlike existing 2D approaches, RadiomicsRetrieval fully exploits
volumetric data to leverage richer spatial context in medical images. We employ
a promptable segmentation model (e.g., SAM) to derive tumor-specific image
embeddings, which are aligned with radiomics features extracted from the same
tumor via contrastive learning. These representations are further enriched by
anatomical positional embedding (APE). As a result, RadiomicsRetrieval enables
flexible querying based on shape, location, or partial feature sets. Extensive
experiments on both lung CT and brain MRI public datasets demonstrate that
radiomics features significantly enhance retrieval specificity, while APE
provides global anatomical context essential for location-based searches.
Notably, our framework requires only minimal user prompts (e.g., a single
point), minimizing segmentation overhead and supporting diverse clinical
scenarios. The capability to query using either image embeddings or selected
radiomics attributes highlights its adaptability, potentially benefiting
diagnosis, treatment planning, and research on large-scale medical imaging
repositories. Our code is available at

TL;DR: SAM 2在目标分割任务中表现优异，成为视觉目标跟踪的SOTA。通过强化学习优化内存更新，性能提升超过现有启发式方法的三倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖手工规则处理干扰、遮挡和运动，强化学习为内存控制提供更优解决方案。

Method: 将内存控制建模为序列决策问题，使用强化学习优化SAM 2的内存更新。

Result: 在单视频过拟合设置中，性能提升超过现有启发式方法三倍。

Conclusion: 强化学习是内存控制的有效替代方案，揭示了内存银行的潜力。

Abstract: Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2) has demonstrated strong performance in
object segmentation tasks and has become the state-of-the-art for visual object
tracking. The model stores information from previous frames in a memory bank,
enabling temporal consistency across video sequences. Recent methods augment
SAM 2 with hand-crafted update rules to better handle distractors, occlusions,
and object motion. We propose a fundamentally different approach using
reinforcement learning for optimizing memory updates in SAM 2 by framing memory
control as a sequential decision-making problem. In an overfitting setup with a
separate agent per video, our method achieves a relative improvement over SAM 2
that exceeds by more than three times the gains of existing heuristics. These
results reveal the untapped potential of the memory bank and highlight
reinforcement learning as a powerful alternative to hand-crafted update rules
for memory control in visual object tracking.

TL;DR: 提出DA-KPN方法，通过轻量级转换函数和多尺度判别器，确保合成标签与翻译图像的语义匹配，优于现有GAN方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有无配对图像翻译方法在语义分割中因语义匹配不保证导致的性能问题。

Method: 使用轻量级转换函数估计像素级输入变换参数，并通过多尺度判别器确保翻译的逼真性。

Result: 在合成到真实数据的语义分割任务中表现优于现有GAN方法，在人脸解析任务中表现相当。

Conclusion: DA-KPN在低数据量情况下有效提升语义分割性能，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation relies on many dense pixel-wise annotations to achieve
the best performance, but owing to the difficulty of obtaining accurate
annotations for real world data, practitioners train on large-scale synthetic
datasets. Unpaired image translation is one method used to address the ensuing
domain gap by generating more realistic training data in low-data regimes.
Current methods for unpaired image translation train generative adversarial
networks (GANs) to perform the translation and enforce pixel-level semantic
matching through cycle consistency. These methods do not guarantee that the
semantic matching holds, posing a problem for semantic segmentation where
performance is sensitive to noisy pixel labels. We propose a novel image
translation method, Domain Adversarial Kernel Prediction Network (DA-KPN), that
guarantees semantic matching between the synthetic label and translation.
DA-KPN estimates pixel-wise input transformation parameters of a lightweight
and simple translation function. To ensure the pixel-wise transformation is
realistic, DA-KPN uses multi-scale discriminators to distinguish between
translated and target samples. We show DA-KPN outperforms previous GAN-based
methods on syn2real benchmarks for semantic segmentation with limited access to
real image labels and achieves comparable performance on face parsing.

TL;DR: 提出DISC方法，通过分离实例和场景上下文优化3D语义场景补全，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于体素的方法限制了类别级信息的利用，影响补全结果的粒度。

Method: 采用双流范式，用类别查询替代体素查询，并设计专用解码模块。

Result: 在SemanticKITTI和SSCBench-KITTI-360上达到SOTA，mIoU分别为17.35和20.55。

Conclusion: DISC通过优化类别级信息流，显著提升了单帧输入的3D场景补全性能。

Abstract: 3D Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) has gained increasing attention due to its
pivotal role in 3D perception. Recent advancements have primarily focused on
refining voxel-level features to construct 3D scenes. However, treating voxels
as the basic interaction units inherently limits the utilization of class-level
information, which is proven critical for enhancing the granularity of
completion results. To address this, we propose \textbf{D}isentangling Instance
and Scene Contexts (DISC), a novel dual-stream paradigm that enhances learning
for both instance and scene categories through separated optimization.
Specifically, we replace voxel queries with discriminative class queries, which
incorporate class-specific geometric and semantic priors. Additionally, we
exploit the intrinsic properties of classes to design specialized decoding
modules, facilitating targeted interactions and efficient class-level
information flow. Experimental results demonstrate that DISC achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on both SemanticKITTI and
SSCBench-KITTI-360 benchmarks, with mIoU scores of 17.35 and 20.55,
respectively. Remarkably, DISC even outperforms multi-frame SOTA methods using
only single-frame input and significantly improves instance category
performance, surpassing both single-frame and multi-frame SOTA instance mIoU by
17.9\% and 11.9\%, respectively, on the SemanticKITTI hidden test. The code is

outperforming state-of-the-art methods including SCAU-Net, CA-Net, and 3D
U-Net. Ablation studies confirmed critical contributions of semantic and
spatial modules to boundary precision. Conclusion: Multi-modal semantic fusion
combined with bidirectional interactive attention significantly enhances brain
tumor segmentation performance, establishing new paradigms for integrating
clinical knowledge into medical image analysis.

TL;DR: 论文提出BayesTTA方法，解决视觉语言模型在时间演化分布偏移下的持续测试时适应问题，通过贝叶斯框架实现时间一致性预测和动态表示对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有持续测试时适应方法忽视时间连续性，导致长范围分布建模受限、熵置信度不可靠及静态视觉表示与演化输入不对齐。

Method: BayesTTA通过增量估计类条件高斯混合分布、自适应选择协方差结构和校准推理，动态对齐视觉表示。

Result: 在四个时间演化数据集和十个标准TTA数据集上，BayesTTA显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: BayesTTA有效解决了时间演化分布偏移下的持续适应问题，性能优越且高效。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP achieve strong zero-shot
recognition but degrade significantly under \textit{temporally evolving
distribution shifts} common in real-world scenarios (e.g., gradual illumination
or seasonal changes). Existing continual test-time adaptation (CTTA) methods
are typically built around sudden and severe distribution shifts and neglect
temporal continuity, leading to three core defects: limited memory cache
restricts long-range distribution modeling, causing catastrophic forgetting;
entropy-based confidence becomes unreliable under temporal drift, worsening
error accumulation; and static visual representations misalign with evolving
inputs. We formalize this practical problem as \textit{Continual-Temporal
Test-Time Adaptation (CT-TTA)}, where test distributions evolve gradually over
time. To address it, we propose \textit{BayesTTA}, a Bayesian adaptation
framework that enforces temporally consistent predictions and dynamically
aligns visual representations. Specifically, BayesTTA incrementally estimates
class-conditional Gaussian mixture distributions without storing raw data,
adaptively selects covariance structures through statistical hypothesis
testing, and performs calibrated inference using Gaussian discriminant analysis
(GDA). These calibrated predictions supervise self-paced adaptation of
normalization layers, ensuring efficient and stable representation alignment.
We establish a comprehensive CT-TTA benchmark across four temporally evolving
datasets and further evaluate generalization on ten standard TTA datasets.
Extensive experiments show that BayesTTA consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, achieving significant gains while maintaining
efficiency. Code is available at

Result: 标准化标注适用于日期和出生地等可标准化字段，而外交标注更适用于姓名等不可标准化字段。

Conclusion: 不同标注策略适用于不同类型的字段，优化标注方法可提升转录效果。

Abstract: This study evaluates the recently proposed Document Attention Network (DAN)
for extracting key-value information from Uruguayan birth certificates,

automatically transcribing handwritten documents, fine-tuning DAN with minimal
training data and annotation effort. Experiments were conducted on two datasets
containing the same images (201 scans of birth certificates written by more
than 15 different writers) but with different annotation methods. Our findings
indicate that normalized annotation is more effective for fields that can be
standardized, such as dates and places of birth, whereas diplomatic annotation
performs much better for fields containing names and surnames, which can not be
standardized.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在结合多帧BEV特征时，由于物体运动导致特征动态变化，性能提升有限。

Method: 使用循环结构结合BEV特征，MBFNet提取运动特征并动态对齐历史与当前特征，采用时序一致性学习损失。

Result: 在nuScenes测试集上达到63.9% NDS，性能优于当前最佳方法SOLOFusion。

Conclusion: OnlineBEV通过时序特征对齐和循环结构，实现了高效的3D感知性能提升。

Abstract: Multi-view camera-based 3D perception can be conducted using bird's eye view
(BEV) features obtained through perspective view-to-BEV transformations.
Several studies have shown that the performance of these 3D perception methods
can be further enhanced by combining sequential BEV features obtained from
multiple camera frames. However, even after compensating for the ego-motion of
an autonomous agent, the performance gain from temporal aggregation is limited
when combining a large number of image frames. This limitation arises due to
dynamic changes in BEV features over time caused by object motion. In this
paper, we introduce a novel temporal 3D perception method called OnlineBEV,
which combines BEV features over time using a recurrent structure. This
structure increases the effective number of combined features with minimal
memory usage. However, it is critical to spatially align the features over time
to maintain strong performance. OnlineBEV employs the Motion-guided BEV Fusion
Network (MBFNet) to achieve temporal feature alignment. MBFNet extracts motion
features from consecutive BEV frames and dynamically aligns historical BEV
features with current ones using these motion features. To enforce temporal
feature alignment explicitly, we use Temporal Consistency Learning Loss, which
captures discrepancies between historical and target BEV features. Experiments
conducted on the nuScenes benchmark demonstrate that OnlineBEV achieves
significant performance gains over the current best method, SOLOFusion.
OnlineBEV achieves 63.9% NDS on the nuScenes test set, recording
state-of-the-art performance in the camera-only 3D object detection task.

Motivation: 传统手动构建图像数据集耗时且低效，而生成数据虽能提供解决方案，但真实数据更具价值。

Result: 在扩展现有数据集和从零创建新数据集的实验中，DatasetAgent构建的数据集成功用于训练多种视觉模型。

Conclusion: DatasetAgent能高效构建高质量图像数据集，满足用户需求，优于传统方法。

Abstract: Common knowledge indicates that the process of constructing image datasets
usually depends on the time-intensive and inefficient method of manual
collection and annotation. Large models offer a solution via data generation.
Nonetheless, real-world data are obviously more valuable comparing to
artificially intelligence generated data, particularly in constructing image
datasets. For this reason, we propose a novel method for auto-constructing
datasets from real-world images by a multiagent collaborative system, named as
DatasetAgent. By coordinating four different agents equipped with Multi-modal
Large Language Models (MLLMs), as well as a tool package for image
optimization, DatasetAgent is able to construct high-quality image datasets
according to user-specified requirements. In particular, two types of
experiments are conducted, including expanding existing datasets and creating
new ones from scratch, on a variety of open-source datasets. In both cases,
multiple image datasets constructed by DatasetAgent are used to train various
vision models for image classification, object detection, and image
segmentation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Transformer的模型（7T-Restormer），用于从常规1.5T或3T T1加权图像合成7T质量的T1图，解决了7T MRI成本高和稀缺的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 7T MRI具有更高的分辨率和对比度，但成本高且存在技术挑战。通过合成7T质量的图像，可以使其更广泛地应用于临床。

Method: 使用141例患者的1.5T和3T T1加权MRI数据训练模型，并与ResViT和ResShift模型进行比较。

Result: 7T-Restormer在1.5T和3T输入下均表现优异，PSNR和SSIM指标显著优于其他模型，且参数更少。

Conclusion: 该方法能够高效合成7T质量的图像，为临床工作流程提供了更便捷的解决方案。

Abstract: Purpose: Ultra-high-field 7T MRI offers improved resolution and contrast over
standard clinical field strengths (1.5T, 3T). However, 7T scanners are costly,
scarce, and introduce additional challenges such as susceptibility artifacts.
We propose an efficient transformer-based model (7T-Restormer) to synthesize
7T-quality T1-maps from routine 1.5T or 3T T1-weighted (T1W) images. Methods:
Our model was validated on 35 1.5T and 108 3T T1w MRI paired with corresponding
7T T1 maps of patients with confirmed MS. A total of 141 patient cases (32,128
slices) were randomly divided into 105 (25; 80) training cases (19,204 slices),
19 (5; 14) validation cases (3,476 slices), and 17 (5; 14) test cases (3,145
slices) where (X; Y) denotes the patients with 1.5T and 3T T1W scans,
respectively. The synthetic 7T T1 maps were compared against the ResViT and
ResShift models. Results: The 7T-Restormer model achieved a PSNR of 26.0 +/-
4.6 dB, SSIM of 0.861 +/- 0.072, and NMSE of 0.019 +/- 0.011 for 1.5T inputs,
and 25.9 +/- 4.9 dB, and 0.866 +/- 0.077 for 3T inputs, respectively. Using
10.5 M parameters, our model reduced NMSE by 64 % relative to 56.7M parameter
ResShift (0.019 vs 0.052, p = <.001 and by 41 % relative to 70.4M parameter
ResViT (0.019 vs 0.032, p = <.001) at 1.5T, with similar advantages at 3T
(0.021 vs 0.060 and 0.033; p < .001). Training with a mixed 1.5 T + 3 T corpus
was superior to single-field strategies. Restricting the model to 1.5T
increased the 1.5T NMSE from 0.019 to 0.021 (p = 1.1E-3) while training solely
on 3T resulted in lower performance on input 1.5T T1W MRI. Conclusion: We
propose a novel method for predicting quantitative 7T MP2RAGE maps from 1.5T
and 3T T1W scans with higher quality than existing state-of-the-art methods.
Our approach makes the benefits of 7T MRI more accessible to standard clinical
workflows.

TL;DR: ByDeWay是一个无需训练的多模态大语言模型（MLLM）性能增强框架，通过分层深度提示（LDP）策略提升空间推理和基础能力。


<details>

Motivation: 现有MLLM在空间推理和基础任务中存在性能不足和幻觉问题，ByDeWay旨在通过深度感知提示解决这些问题。

Method: 使用单目深度估计将场景分为近、中、远三层，生成区域特定描述，并将其附加到图像-问题提示中，增强空间上下文。

Result: 在POPE和GQA基准测试中，ByDeWay显著减少了幻觉并提升了推理能力，适用于多种MLLM。

Conclusion: ByDeWay通过深度感知提示在零训练设置下有效提升了MLLM的性能，具有轻量化和模块化优势。

Abstract: We introduce ByDeWay, a training-free framework designed to enhance the
performance of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). ByDeWay uses a novel
prompting strategy called Layered-Depth-Based Prompting (LDP), which improves
spatial reasoning and grounding without modifying any model parameters. It
segments the scene into closest, mid-range, and farthest layers using monocular
depth estimation, then generates region-specific captions with a grounded
vision-language model. These structured, depth-aware captions are appended to
the image-question prompt, enriching it with spatial context. This guides MLLMs
to produce more grounded and less hallucinated responses. Our method is
lightweight, modular, and compatible with black-box MLLMs. Experiments on
hallucination-sensitive (POPE) and reasoning-intensive (GQA) benchmarks show
consistent improvements across multiple MLLMs, validating the effectiveness of
depth-aware prompting in a zero-training setting.

Conclusion: MoSAiC为多模态卫星图像的语义解耦和鲁棒表示学习提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Contrastive learning (CL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for learning
transferable representations without the reliance on large labeled datasets.
Its ability to capture intrinsic similarities and differences among data
samples has led to state-of-the-art results in computer vision tasks. These
strengths make CL particularly well-suited for Earth System Observation (ESO),
where diverse satellite modalities such as optical and SAR imagery offer
naturally aligned views of the same geospatial regions. However, ESO presents
unique challenges, including high inter-class similarity, scene clutter, and
ambiguous boundaries, which complicate representation learning -- especially in
low-label, multi-label settings. Existing CL frameworks often focus on
intra-modality self-supervision or lack mechanisms for multi-label alignment
and semantic precision across modalities. In this work, we introduce MoSAiC, a
unified framework that jointly optimizes intra- and inter-modality contrastive
learning with a multi-label supervised contrastive loss. Designed specifically
for multi-modal satellite imagery, MoSAiC enables finer semantic
disentanglement and more robust representation learning across spectrally
similar and spatially complex classes. Experiments on two benchmark datasets,
BigEarthNet V2.0 and Sent12MS, show that MoSAiC consistently outperforms both
fully supervised and self-supervised baselines in terms of accuracy, cluster
coherence, and generalization in low-label and high-class-overlap scenarios.

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) enables non-invasive, high-resolution
analysis of muscle structures. However, automated segmentation remains limited
by high computational costs, reliance on large training datasets, and reduced
accuracy in segmenting smaller muscles. Convolutional neural network
(CNN)-based methods, while powerful, often suffer from substantial
computational overhead, limited generalizability, and poor interpretability
across diverse populations. This study proposes a training-free segmentation
approach based on keypoint tracking, which integrates keypoint selection with
Lucas-Kanade optical flow. The proposed method achieves a mean Dice similarity
coefficient (DSC) ranging from 0.6 to 0.7, depending on the keypoint selection
strategy, performing comparably to state-of-the-art CNN-based models while
substantially reducing computational demands and enhancing interpretability.
This scalable framework presents a robust and explainable alternative for

Abstract: We propose a novel embedding-based captioning metric termed as L-CLIPScore
that can be used for efficiently evaluating caption quality and training
captioning model. L-CLIPScore is calculated from a lightweight CLIP (L-CLIP),
which is a dual-encoder architecture compressed and distilled from CLIP. To
compress, we apply two powerful techniques which are weight multiplexing and
matrix decomposition for reducing the parameters of encoders and word embedding
matrix, respectively. To distill, we design a novel multi-modal Similarity
Regulator (SR) loss to transfer more vision-language alignment knowledge.
Specifically, SR loss amplifies the multi-modal embedding similarity if the
given image-text pair is matched and diminishes the similarity if the pair is
non-matched. By compressing and distilling by this novel SR loss, our L-CLIP
achieves comparable multi-modal alignment ability to the original CLIP while it
requires fewer computation resources and running time. We carry out exhaustive
experiments to validate the efficiency and effectiveness of L-CLIPScore when
using it as the judge to evaluate caption quality. We also discover that when
using L-CLIPScore as the supervisor to train the captioning model, it should be
mixed up by an n-gram-based metric and meanwhile analyze why using L-CLIPScore
only will cause fail training.

TL;DR: SGPMIL是一种基于稀疏高斯过程的概率注意力MIL框架，通过量化实例级注意力分数的不确定性，提高了预测的可靠性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有确定性注意力MIL方法缺乏对实例相关性的不确定性量化，这在数字病理学等仅有粗粒度标签的场景中尤为重要。

Method: 提出SGPMIL框架，利用稀疏高斯过程学习注意力分数的后验分布，并引入特征缩放以优化训练效率和性能。

Result: 在多个数字病理学数据集上，SGPMIL在袋级和实例级评估中均表现出色，提升了预测的可靠性和校准性。

Conclusion: SGPMIL不仅保持了袋级性能，还显著改进了不确定性下的实例级预测质量，为MIL任务提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) offers a natural solution for settings where
only coarse, bag-level labels are available, without having access to
instance-level annotations. This is usually the case in digital pathology,
which consists of gigapixel sized images. While deterministic attention-based
MIL approaches achieve strong bag-level performance, they often overlook the
uncertainty inherent in instance relevance. In this paper, we address the lack
of uncertainty quantification in instance-level attention scores by introducing
\textbf{SGPMIL}, a new probabilistic attention-based MIL framework grounded in
Sparse Gaussian Processes (SGP). By learning a posterior distribution over
attention scores, SGPMIL enables principled uncertainty estimation, resulting
in more reliable and calibrated instance relevance maps. Our approach not only
preserves competitive bag-level performance but also significantly improves the
quality and interpretability of instance-level predictions under uncertainty.
SGPMIL extends prior work by introducing feature scaling in the SGP predictive
mean function, leading to faster training, improved efficiency, and enhanced
instance-level performance. Extensive experiments on multiple well-established
digital pathology datasets highlight the effectiveness of our approach across
both bag- and instance-level evaluations. Our code will be made publicly
available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有公开数据集在场景复杂性、分辨率和多样性方面存在局限，无法满足真实世界的需求。

Method: 通过四个非重叠的高分辨率摄像头采集40分钟视频，标注了512辆车的跨摄像头关联数据。

Result: 提供了包括车辆检测、单摄像头跟踪、车辆重识别和多摄像头跟踪的基线结果。

Conclusion: RoundaboutHD为智能城市应用提供了更接近真实场景的数据支持。

Abstract: The multi-camera vehicle tracking (MCVT) framework holds significant
potential for smart city applications, including anomaly detection, traffic
density estimation, and suspect vehicle tracking. However, current publicly
available datasets exhibit limitations, such as overly simplistic scenarios,
low-resolution footage, and insufficiently diverse conditions, creating a
considerable gap between academic research and real-world scenario. To fill
this gap, we introduce RoundaboutHD, a comprehensive, high-resolution
multi-camera vehicle tracking benchmark dataset specifically designed to
represent real-world roundabout scenarios. RoundaboutHD provides a total of 40
minutes of labelled video footage captured by four non-overlapping,
high-resolution (4K resolution, 15 fps) cameras. In total, 512 unique vehicle
identities are annotated across different camera views, offering rich
cross-camera association data. RoundaboutHD offers temporal consistency video
footage and enhanced challenges, including increased occlusions and nonlinear
movement inside the roundabout. In addition to the full MCVT dataset, several
subsets are also available for object detection, single camera tracking, and
image-based vehicle re-identification (ReID) tasks. Vehicle model information
and camera modelling/ geometry information are also included to support further
analysis. We provide baseline results for vehicle detection, single-camera
tracking, image-based vehicle re-identification, and multi-camera tracking. The

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出使用基于谱总变分（STV）特征的弱学习器集成方法，解决计算机视觉中训练数据不足的问题，并在医学影像问题上验证其优于深度学习和Radiomics方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算机视觉中常面临训练数据不足的问题，需要一种有效的方法来提升模型性能。

Method: 利用STV特征构建弱学习器集成，STV特征能有效表征多尺度纹理，且特征间相关性低。

Result: 在医学影像数据集上，STV方法（AUC=0.87）优于深度学习（AUC=0.75）和Radiomics（AUC=0.79）。

Conclusion: STV特征集成方法在数据不足时表现优异，尤其在CT影像中细尺度STV特征对PET高摄取预测有显著指示作用。

Abstract: Solving computer vision problems through machine learning, one often
encounters lack of sufficient training data. To mitigate this we propose the
use of ensembles of weak learners based on spectral total-variation (STV)
features (Gilboa 2014). The features are related to nonlinear eigenfunctions of
the total-variation subgradient and can characterize well textures at various
scales. It was shown (Burger et-al 2016) that, in the one-dimensional case,
orthogonal features are generated, whereas in two-dimensions the features are
empirically lowly correlated. Ensemble learning theory advocates the use of
lowly correlated weak learners. We thus propose here to design ensembles using
learners based on STV features. To show the effectiveness of this paradigm we
examine a hard real-world medical imaging problem: the predictive value of
computed tomography (CT) data for high uptake in positron emission tomography
(PET) for patients suspected of skeletal metastases. The database consists of
457 scans with 1524 unique pairs of registered CT and PET slices. Our approach
is compared to deep-learning methods and to Radiomics features, showing STV
learners perform best (AUC=0.87), compared to neural nets (AUC=0.75) and
Radiomics (AUC=0.79). We observe that fine STV scales in CT images are
especially indicative for the presence of high uptake in PET.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法在分层土地覆盖和土地利用分类中存在局限性，无法生成端到端的多粒度预测，且跨域任务中的异质层次问题未得到充分关注。

Method: 提出HieraRS范式，引入BHCCM机制生成分层预测，并设计TransLU框架（包含CDKS和CDSA）支持跨域任务。

Result: 构建了MM-5B数据集，HieraRS在语义一致性和分类精度上表现优异，支持动态类别扩展和跨域适应。

Conclusion: HieraRS和TransLU为分层分类和跨域任务提供了灵活且通用的解决方案，推动了LCLU模型的实际应用。

Abstract: Hierarchical land cover and land use (LCLU) classification aims to assign
pixel-wise labels with multiple levels of semantic granularity to remote
sensing (RS) imagery. However, existing deep learning-based methods face two
major challenges: 1) They predominantly adopt a flat classification paradigm,
which limits their ability to generate end-to-end multi-granularity
hierarchical predictions aligned with tree-structured hierarchies used in
practice. 2) Most cross-domain studies focus on performance degradation caused
by sensor or scene variations, with limited attention to transferring LCLU
models to cross-domain tasks with heterogeneous hierarchies (e.g., LCLU to crop
classification). These limitations hinder the flexibility and generalization of
LCLU models in practical applications. To address these challenges, we propose
HieraRS, a novel hierarchical interpretation paradigm that enables
multi-granularity predictions and supports the efficient transfer of LCLU
models to cross-domain tasks with heterogeneous tree-structured hierarchies. We
introduce the Bidirectional Hierarchical Consistency Constraint Mechanism
(BHCCM), which can be seamlessly integrated into mainstream flat classification
models to generate hierarchical predictions, while improving both semantic
consistency and classification accuracy. Furthermore, we present TransLU, a
dual-branch cross-domain transfer framework comprising two key components:
Cross-Domain Knowledge Sharing (CDKS) and Cross-Domain Semantic Alignment
(CDSA). TransLU supports dynamic category expansion and facilitates the
effective adaptation of LCLU models to heterogeneous hierarchies. In addition,
we construct MM-5B, a large-scale multi-modal hierarchical land use dataset
featuring pixel-wise annotations. The code and MM-5B dataset will be released
at: https://github.com/AI-Tianlong/HieraRS.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖静态地图或昂贵传感器，限制了可扩展性和适应性，同时大规模数字孪生面临隐私、通信和计算效率问题。

Method: 提出Geo-ORBIT框架，包括轻量级车道检测模型GeoLane、个性化检测参数的Meta-GeoLane，以及联邦学习策略FedMeta-GeoLane。

Result: FedMeta-GeoLane在多样城市场景中表现优于基线方法，几何误差更低，泛化能力更强，通信开销大幅减少。

Conclusion: Geo-ORBIT为灵活、上下文感知的数字孪生基础设施建模奠定了基础。

Abstract: Digital Twins (DT) have the potential to transform traffic management and
operations by creating dynamic, virtual representations of transportation
systems that sense conditions, analyze operations, and support decision-making.
A key component for DT of the transportation system is dynamic roadway geometry
sensing. However, existing approaches often rely on static maps or costly
sensors, limiting scalability and adaptability. Additionally, large-scale DTs
that collect and analyze data from multiple sources face challenges in privacy,
communication, and computational efficiency. To address these challenges, we
introduce Geo-ORBIT (Geometrical Operational Roadway Blueprint with Integrated
Twin), a unified framework that combines real-time lane detection, DT
synchronization, and federated meta-learning. At the core of Geo-ORBIT is
GeoLane, a lightweight lane detection model that learns lane geometries from
vehicle trajectory data using roadside cameras. We extend this model through
Meta-GeoLane, which learns to personalize detection parameters for local
entities, and FedMeta-GeoLane, a federated learning strategy that ensures
scalable and privacy-preserving adaptation across roadside deployments. Our
system is integrated with CARLA and SUMO to create a high-fidelity DT that
renders highway scenarios and captures traffic flows in real-time. Extensive
experiments across diverse urban scenes show that FedMeta-GeoLane consistently
outperforms baseline and meta-learning approaches, achieving lower geometric
error and stronger generalization to unseen locations while drastically
reducing communication overhead. This work lays the foundation for flexible,
context-aware infrastructure modeling in DTs. The framework is publicly
available at https://github.com/raynbowy23/FedMeta-GeoLane.git.

TL;DR: Birkhoff是一种无数据压缩算法，专为Segment Anything Model（SAM）及其变体设计，具有高效、通用和快速的特点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于SAM及其变体在零样本分割中的优异表现，压缩这些模型成为实际需求。

Method: Birkhoff提出Hyper-Compression算法，将高维参数向量转为低维标量，并设计HyperLinear加速推理。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，Birkhoff在压缩比、性能和速度上表现优异，例如5.17x压缩比且性能下降小于1%。

Conclusion: Birkhoff是一种高效、通用的压缩方法，适用于SAM及其变体。

Abstract: Due to the excellent performance in yielding high-quality, zero-shot
segmentation, Segment Anything Model (SAM) and its variants have been widely
applied in diverse scenarios such as healthcare and intelligent manufacturing.
Therefore, effectively compressing SAMs has become an increasingly pressing
practical need. In this study, we propose Birkhoff, a novel data-free
compression algorithm for SAM and its variants. Unlike quantization, pruning,
distillation, and other compression methods, Birkhoff embodies versatility
across model types, agility in deployment, faithfulness to the original model,
and compactness in model size. Specifically, Birkhoff introduces a novel
compression algorithm: Hyper-Compression, whose core principle is to find a
dense trajectory to turn a high-dimensional parameter vector into a
low-dimensional scalar. Furthermore, Birkhoff designs a dedicated linear layer
operator, HyperLinear, to fuse decompression and matrix multiplication to
significantly accelerate inference of the compressed SAMs. Extensive
experiments on 18 SAMs in the COCO, LVIS, and SA-1B datasets show that Birkhoff
performs consistently and competitively in compression time, compression ratio,
post-compression performance, and inference speed. For example, Birkhoff can
achieve a compression ratio of 5.17x on SAM2-B, with less than 1% performance
drop without using any fine-tuning data. Moreover, the compression is finished
within 60 seconds for all models.

Result: 模型在10,000张MNIST图像上达到99.2%的测试准确率。

Conclusion: 深度特征提取和原型覆盖对高性能至关重要，该方法在模式识别中有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: This study presents a hybrid model for classifying handwritten digits in the
MNIST dataset, combining convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with a multi-well
Hopfield network. The approach employs a CNN to extract high-dimensional
features from input images, which are then clustered into class-specific
prototypes using k-means clustering. These prototypes serve as attractors in a
multi-well energy landscape, where a Hopfield network performs classification
by minimizing an energy function that balances feature similarity and class
assignment.The model's design enables robust handling of intraclass
variability, such as diverse handwriting styles, while providing an
interpretable framework through its energy-based decision process. Through
systematic optimization of the CNN architecture and the number of wells, the
model achieves a high test accuracy of 99.2% on 10,000 MNIST images,
demonstrating its effectiveness for image classification tasks. The findings
highlight the critical role of deep feature extraction and sufficient prototype
coverage in achieving high performance, with potential for broader applications
in pattern recognition.

Result: CoPart在部分级别编辑、关节对象生成和场景组合方面表现出色，提供了前所未有的控制能力。

Conclusion: CoPart通过部分感知的扩散框架，显著提升了3D生成的细节表现和可控性。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D generation have transitioned from multi-view 2D
rendering approaches to 3D-native latent diffusion frameworks that exploit
geometric priors in ground truth data. Despite progress, three key limitations
persist: (1) Single-latent representations fail to capture complex multi-part
geometries, causing detail degradation; (2) Holistic latent coding neglects
part independence and interrelationships critical for compositional design; (3)
Global conditioning mechanisms lack fine-grained controllability. Inspired by
human 3D design workflows, we propose CoPart - a part-aware diffusion framework
that decomposes 3D objects into contextual part latents for coherent multi-part
generation. This paradigm offers three advantages: i) Reduces encoding
complexity through part decomposition; ii) Enables explicit part relationship
modeling; iii) Supports part-level conditioning. We further develop a mutual
guidance strategy to fine-tune pre-trained diffusion models for joint part
latent denoising, ensuring both geometric coherence and foundation model
priors. To enable large-scale training, we construct Partverse - a novel 3D
part dataset derived from Objaverse through automated mesh segmentation and
human-verified annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate CoPart's superior
capabilities in part-level editing, articulated object generation, and scene
composition with unprecedented controllability.

Motivation: 传统渲染方法在数据压缩和计算效率上存在局限，CLiFTs旨在解决这一问题，同时保持高质量的渲染效果。

Method: 使用多视图编码器将图像和相机姿态转换为令牌，通过潜在空间K均值选择代表性射线作为簇中心，构建CLiFTs。测试时根据计算预算和目标视图合成新视图。

Result: 在RealEstate10K和DL3DV数据集上验证了方法的有效性，实现了数据显著压缩且渲染质量相当，同时提供数据大小、质量和速度的权衡。

Conclusion: CLiFTs提供了一种高效且灵活的神经渲染方案，适用于动态场景表示和计算资源受限的场景。

Abstract: This paper proposes a neural rendering approach that represents a scene as
"compressed light-field tokens (CLiFTs)", retaining rich appearance and
geometric information of a scene. CLiFT enables compute-efficient rendering by
compressed tokens, while being capable of changing the number of tokens to
represent a scene or render a novel view with one trained network. Concretely,
given a set of images, multi-view encoder tokenizes the images with the camera
poses. Latent-space K-means selects a reduced set of rays as cluster centroids
using the tokens. The multi-view ``condenser'' compresses the information of
all the tokens into the centroid tokens to construct CLiFTs. At test time,
given a target view and a compute budget (i.e., the number of CLiFTs), the
system collects the specified number of nearby tokens and synthesizes a novel
view using a compute-adaptive renderer. Extensive experiments on RealEstate10K
and DL3DV datasets quantitatively and qualitatively validate our approach,
achieving significant data reduction with comparable rendering quality and the
highest overall rendering score, while providing trade-offs of data size,
rendering quality, and rendering speed.

NeuralOS combines a recurrent neural network (RNN), which tracks computer

include both randomly generated interactions and realistic interactions
produced by AI agents. Experiments show that NeuralOS successfully renders
realistic GUI sequences, accurately captures mouse interactions, and reliably
predicts state transitions like application launches. Although modeling
fine-grained keyboard interactions precisely remains challenging, NeuralOS
offers a step toward creating fully adaptive, generative neural interfaces for

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自回归视频生成器要么偏离标准LLM架构，要么依赖笨重的外部文本编码器，或存在高延迟问题。

Method: 提出Lumos-1，保留LLM架构，引入3D RoPE和MM-RoPE方案，并提出AR-DF策略解决帧间损失不平衡问题。

Result: 在48个GPU上预训练，性能与EMU3、COSMOS-Video2World和OpenSoraPlan相当。

Conclusion: Lumos-1通过改进的架构和训练策略，实现了高效且高质量的视频生成。

Abstract: Autoregressive large language models (LLMs) have unified a vast range of
language tasks, inspiring preliminary efforts in autoregressive video
generation. Existing autoregressive video generators either diverge from
standard LLM architectures, depend on bulky external text encoders, or incur
prohibitive latency due to next-token decoding. In this paper, we introduce
Lumos-1, an autoregressive video generator that retains the LLM architecture
with minimal architectural modifications. To inject spatiotemporal correlations
in LLMs, we identify the efficacy of incorporating 3D RoPE and diagnose its
imbalanced frequency spectrum ranges. Therefore, we propose MM-RoPE, a RoPE
scheme that preserves the original textual RoPE while providing comprehensive
frequency spectra and scaled 3D positions for modeling multimodal
spatiotemporal data. Moreover, Lumos-1 resorts to a token dependency strategy
that obeys intra-frame bidirectionality and inter-frame temporal causality.
Based on this dependency strategy, we identify the issue of frame-wise loss
imbalance caused by spatial information redundancy and solve it by proposing
Autoregressive Discrete Diffusion Forcing (AR-DF). AR-DF introduces temporal
tube masking during training with a compatible inference-time masking policy to
avoid quality degradation. By using memory-efficient training techniques, we
pre-train Lumos-1 on only 48 GPUs, achieving performance comparable to EMU3 on
GenEval, COSMOS-Video2World on VBench-I2V, and OpenSoraPlan on VBench-T2V. Code

Result: 噪声水平超过临界值时，堵塞消失；简单反应式导航在中等密度下表现良好且计算高效。

Conclusion: 噪声可以优化群体目标达成率，简单导航方案在现实问题中更具实用性。

Abstract: In crowded environments, individuals must navigate around other occupants to
reach their destinations. Understanding and controlling traffic flows in these
spaces is relevant to coordinating robot swarms and designing infrastructure
for dense populations. Here, we combine simulations, theory, and robotic
experiments to study how noisy motion can disrupt traffic jams and enable flow
as agents travel to individual goals. Above a critical noise level, large jams
do not persist. From this observation, we analytically approximate the goal
attainment rate as a function of the noise level, then solve for the optimal
agent density and noise level that maximize the swarm's goal attainment rate.
We perform robotic experiments to corroborate our simulated and theoretical
results. Finally, we compare simple, local navigation approaches with a
sophisticated but computationally costly central planner. A simple reactive
scheme performs well up to moderate densities and is far more computationally
efficient than a planner, suggesting lessons for real-world problems.

A newly obtained visual dataset for navigation was collected in diverse
environments with varying lighting conditions and dynamic obstacles. During
data collection, a communication link was established over Wi-Fi between a
remote server and the robot, using Robot Operating System (ROS) topics.
Velocity commands were transmitted from the server to the robot, enabling

TL;DR: SelfReVision是一个轻量级、可扩展的自改进框架，用于提升视觉语言模型在机器人程序规划中的表现，无需外部监督。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在机器人程序规划中表现良好，但缺乏低层次细节；视觉语言模型（VLMs）虽能提供更接地气的规划，但现有方法依赖昂贵的大模型或局限于仿真环境。

Method: SelfReVision通过自蒸馏循环（自我批评、修订和验证）提升小规模VLMs的规划质量，无需外部监督。

Result: 实验表明，SelfReVision显著提升了基础VLMs的性能，甚至优于规模大100倍的模型，并在下游任务中表现更优。

Conclusion: SelfReVision为轻量级VLMs提供了一种高效的自改进方法，显著提升了规划质量和执行能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in robotic procedural
planning, yet their human-centric reasoning often omits the low-level, grounded
details needed for robotic execution. Vision-language models (VLMs) offer a
path toward more perceptually grounded plans, but current methods either rely
on expensive, large-scale models or are constrained to narrow simulation
settings. We introduce SelfReVision, a lightweight and scalable
self-improvement framework for vision-language procedural planning.
SelfReVision enables small VLMs to iteratively critique, revise, and verify
their own plans-without external supervision or teacher models-drawing
inspiration from chain-of-thought prompting and self-instruct paradigms.
Through this self-distillation loop, models generate higher-quality,
execution-ready plans that can be used both at inference and for continued
fine-tuning. Using models varying from 3B to 72B, our results show that
SelfReVision not only boosts performance over weak base VLMs but also
outperforms models 100X the size, yielding improved control in downstream
embodied tasks.

TL;DR: CL3R是一个新颖的3D预训练框架，旨在通过结合空间感知和语义理解来增强机器人操作策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在利用2D基础模型时难以捕捉3D空间信息并泛化到不同视角，限制了策略在精细操作中的有效性。

Method: CL3R采用点云掩码自编码器学习3D表示，并通过对比学习结合预训练2D模型，同时提出多视角点云随机融合以提升泛化能力。

Result: 实验表明，CL3R在仿真和现实场景中均表现出色，显著提升了机器人操作的感知能力。

Conclusion: CL3R通过统一坐标系和多视角融合，有效解决了视角模糊问题，为机器人操作策略提供了鲁棒的感知模块。

Abstract: Building a robust perception module is crucial for visuomotor policy
learning. While recent methods incorporate pre-trained 2D foundation models
into robotic perception modules to leverage their strong semantic
understanding, they struggle to capture 3D spatial information and generalize
across diverse camera viewpoints. These limitations hinder the policy's
effectiveness, especially in fine-grained robotic manipulation scenarios. To
address these challenges, we propose CL3R, a novel 3D pre-training framework
designed to enhance robotic manipulation policies. Our method integrates both
spatial awareness and semantic understanding by employing a point cloud Masked
Autoencoder to learn rich 3D representations while leveraging pre-trained 2D
foundation models through contrastive learning for efficient semantic knowledge
transfer. Additionally, we propose a 3D visual representation pre-training
framework for robotic tasks. By unifying coordinate systems across datasets and
introducing random fusion of multi-view point clouds, we mitigate camera view
ambiguity and improve generalization, enabling robust perception from novel
viewpoints at test time. Extensive experiments in both simulation and the real
world demonstrate the superiority of our method, highlighting its effectiveness
in visuomotor policy learning for robotic manipulation.

Abstract: Humanoid robots show significant potential in daily tasks. However,
reinforcement learning-based motion policies often suffer from robustness
degradation due to the sim-to-real dynamics gap, thereby affecting the agility
of real robots. In this work, we propose a novel robust adversarial training
paradigm designed to enhance the robustness of humanoid motion policies in real
worlds. The paradigm introduces a learnable adversarial attack network that
precisely identifies vulnerabilities in motion policies and applies targeted
perturbations, forcing the motion policy to enhance its robustness against
perturbations through dynamic adversarial training. We conduct experiments on
the Unitree G1 humanoid robot for both perceptive locomotion and whole-body
control tasks. The results demonstrate that our proposed method significantly
enhances the robot's motion robustness in real world environments, enabling
successful traversal of challenging terrains and highly agile whole-body
trajectory tracking.

Motivation: 在智能采矿环境中，多LiDAR与GINS系统的精确外参标定对传感器融合至关重要，但现有方法依赖人工目标或重叠视场，且平面运动导致观测性不足。

Abstract: Accurate extrinsic calibration between multiple LiDAR sensors and a
GNSS-aided inertial navigation system (GINS) is essential for achieving
reliable sensor fusion in intelligent mining environments. Such calibration
enables vehicle-road collaboration by aligning perception data from
vehicle-mounted sensors to a unified global reference frame. However, existing
methods often depend on artificial targets, overlapping fields of view, or
precise trajectory estimation, which are assumptions that may not hold in
practice. Moreover, the planar motion of mining vehicles leads to observability
issues that degrade calibration performance. This paper presents a targetless
extrinsic calibration method that aligns multiple onboard LiDAR sensors to the
GINS coordinate system without requiring overlapping sensor views or external
targets. The proposed approach introduces an observation model based on the
known installation height of the GINS unit to constrain unobservable
calibration parameters under planar motion. A joint optimization framework is
developed to refine both the extrinsic parameters and GINS trajectory by
integrating multiple constraints derived from geometric correspondences and
motion consistency. The proposed method is applicable to heterogeneous LiDAR
configurations, including both mechanical and solid-state sensors. Extensive
experiments on simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate the accuracy,
robustness, and practical applicability of the approach under diverse sensor
setups.

Motivation: 现有SLAM方法在结构化环境中表现良好，但在复杂场景下鲁棒性不足，且缺乏标准化评估和多传感器自适应融合策略。

Method: 1. 提出M3DGR数据集，包含多种传感器退化场景；2. 评估40种SLAM系统；3. 开发Ground-Fusion++框架，融合多种传感器。

Result: M3DGR数据集提供了系统性评估工具，Ground-Fusion++在复杂条件下表现出鲁棒性能。

Conclusion: 研究填补了SLAM评估和自适应传感器融合的空白，推动了该领域的进一步发展。

Abstract: Considerable advancements have been achieved in SLAM methods tailored for
structured environments, yet their robustness under challenging corner cases
remains a critical limitation. Although multi-sensor fusion approaches
integrating diverse sensors have shown promising performance improvements, the
research community faces two key barriers: On one hand, the lack of
standardized and configurable benchmarks that systematically evaluate SLAM
algorithms under diverse degradation scenarios hinders comprehensive
performance assessment. While on the other hand, existing SLAM frameworks
primarily focus on fusing a limited set of sensor types, without effectively
addressing adaptive sensor selection strategies for varying environmental
conditions.
  To bridge these gaps, we make three key contributions: First, we introduce
M3DGR dataset: a sensor-rich benchmark with systematically induced degradation
patterns including visual challenge, LiDAR degeneracy, wheel slippage and GNSS
denial. Second, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of forty SLAM systems on
M3DGR, providing critical insights into their robustness and limitations under
challenging real-world conditions. Third, we develop a resilient modular
multi-sensor fusion framework named Ground-Fusion++, which demonstrates robust
performance by coupling GNSS, RGB-D, LiDAR, IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) and
wheel odometry. Codes and datasets are publicly available.

Motivation: 卫星在动态和不确定环境中自主运行时，传统PD控制器和现有DRL算法（如TD3、PPO、A2C）难以满足实时适应性和容错需求。

Method: 提出TD3-HD方法，整合TD3、HER和DWC技术，优化稀疏奖励环境下的学习效果，并在反应轮故障时保持卫星稳定性。

Result: 实验表明，TD3-HD在姿态误差、角速度调节和故障条件下的稳定性方面显著优于PD控制器和其他DRL算法。

Conclusion: TD3-HD是一种强大的、容错的机载AI解决方案，适用于自主卫星姿态控制。

Abstract: Reliable satellite attitude control is essential for the success of space
missions, particularly as satellites increasingly operate autonomously in
dynamic and uncertain environments. Reaction wheels (RWs) play a pivotal role
in attitude control, and maintaining control resilience during RW faults is
critical to preserving mission objectives and system stability. However,
traditional Proportional Derivative (PD) controllers and existing deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms such as TD3, PPO, and A2C often fall
short in providing the real time adaptability and fault tolerance required for
autonomous satellite operations. This study introduces a DRL-based control
strategy designed to improve satellite resilience and adaptability under fault
conditions. Specifically, the proposed method integrates Twin Delayed Deep
Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) with Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) and
Dimension Wise Clipping (DWC) referred to as TD3-HD to enhance learning in
sparse reward environments and maintain satellite stability during RW failures.
The proposed approach is benchmarked against PD control and leading DRL
algorithms. Experimental results show that TD3-HD achieves significantly lower
attitude error, improved angular velocity regulation, and enhanced stability
under fault conditions. These findings underscore the proposed method potential
as a powerful, fault tolerant, onboard AI solution for autonomous satellite
attitude control.

Motivation: LiDAR建图在GNSS受限环境中存在累积漂移问题，导致全局错位，需要一种融合多传感器数据的方法来提高精度。

Method: 通过动态时间规整进行速度对齐，使用扩展卡尔曼滤波优化GNSS和IMU信号，结合NDT配准和位姿图优化构建局部地图，并通过GNSS约束锚点实现全局一致性。

Conclusion: 该方法为GNSS受限环境下的3D城市建图设立了新基准，支持多种应用，数据集和代码将公开。

Abstract: LiDAR-based 3D mapping suffers from cumulative drift causing global
misalignment, particularly in GNSS-constrained environments. To address this,
we propose a unified framework that fuses LiDAR, GNSS, and IMU data for
high-resolution city-scale mapping. The method performs velocity-based temporal
alignment using Dynamic Time Warping and refines GNSS and IMU signals via
extended Kalman filtering. Local maps are built using Normal Distributions
Transform-based registration and pose graph optimization with loop closure
detection, while global consistency is enforced using GNSS-constrained anchors
followed by fine registration of overlapping segments. We also introduce a
large-scale multimodal dataset captured in Perth, Western Australia to
facilitate future research in this direction. Our dataset comprises 144{,}000
frames acquired with a 128-channel Ouster LiDAR, synchronized RTK-GNSS
trajectories, and MEMS-IMU measurements across 21 urban loops. To assess
geometric consistency, we evaluated our method using alignment metrics based on
road centerlines and intersections to capture both global and local accuracy.
Our method reduces the average global alignment error from 3.32\,m to 1.24\,m,
achieving a 61.4\% improvement. The constructed high-fidelity map supports a
wide range of applications, including smart city planning, geospatial data
integration, infrastructure monitoring, and GPS-free navigation. Our method,
and dataset together establish a new benchmark for evaluating 3D city mapping
in GNSS-constrained environments. The dataset and code will be released
publicly.

Result: 完全非线性神经网络模型表现最佳，显著降低了定位误差。

Conclusion: 该方法通过触觉反馈校准有效解决了仿真到现实的转换问题，提升了机器人控制的准确性。

Abstract: When inverse kinematics (IK) is adopted to control robotic arms in
manipulation tasks, there is often a discrepancy between the end effector (EE)
position of the robot model in the simulator and the physical EE in reality. In
most robotic scenarios with sim-to-real transfer, we have information about
joint positions in both simulation and reality, but the EE position is only
available in simulation. We developed a novel method to overcome this
difficulty based on haptic feedback calibration, using a touchscreen in front
of the robot that provides information on the EE position in the real
environment. During the calibration procedure, the robot touches specific
points on the screen, and the information is stored. In the next stage, we
build a transformation function from the data based on linear transformation
and neural networks that is capable of outputting all missing variables from
any partial input (simulated/real joint/EE position). Our results demonstrate
that a fully nonlinear neural network model performs best, significantly
reducing positioning errors.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于强化学习的框架，用于动态、速度感知的全身末端执行器控制，解决了运动与手臂动作之间的目标冲突。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 运动与手臂动作的目标冲突（如水平基座与末端执行器跟踪的基座倾斜需求），以及现有RL方法无法直接控制末端执行器速度的问题。

Method: 采用多批评者-执行者架构解耦运动与操作的奖励信号，并设计了基于扭转的末端执行器任务公式。

Result: 在四足机器人上的仿真和硬件实验验证了控制器能同时行走和移动末端执行器，并表现出全身协作行为。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了运动与操作的任务冲突，实现了动态、速度感知的全身控制。

Abstract: Learning whole-body control for locomotion and arm motions in a single policy
has challenges, as the two tasks have conflicting goals. For instance,
efficient locomotion typically favors a horizontal base orientation, while
end-effector tracking may benefit from base tilting to extend reachability.
Additionally, current Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches using a pose-based
task specification lack the ability to directly control the end-effector
velocity, making smoothly executing trajectories very challenging. To address
these limitations, we propose an RL-based framework that allows for dynamic,
velocity-aware whole-body end-effector control. Our method introduces a
multi-critic actor architecture that decouples the reward signals for
locomotion and manipulation, simplifying reward tuning and allowing the policy
to resolve task conflicts more effectively. Furthermore, we design a
twist-based end-effector task formulation that can track both discrete poses
and motion trajectories. We validate our approach through a set of simulation
and hardware experiments using a quadruped robot equipped with a robotic arm.
The resulting controller can simultaneously walk and move its end-effector and
shows emergent whole-body behaviors, where the base assists the arm in
extending the workspace, despite a lack of explicit formulations.

Result: 在16种家用物体上训练的策略可直接部署到真实环境，实验证明其有效性。

Conclusion: H2RH-SGS为人类-机器人交接任务提供了一种新的有效表示方法。

Abstract: Learning robot manipulation policies from raw, real-world image data requires
a large number of robot-action trials in the physical environment. Although
training using simulations offers a cost-effective alternative, the visual
domain gap between simulation and robot workspace remains a major limitation.
Gaussian Splatting visual reconstruction methods have recently provided new
directions for robot manipulation by generating realistic environments. In this
paper, we propose the first method for learning supervised-based robot
handovers solely from RGB images without the need of real-robot training or
real-robot data collection. The proposed policy learner, Human-to-Robot
Handover using Sparse-View Gaussian Splatting (H2RH-SGS), leverages sparse-view
Gaussian Splatting reconstruction of human-to-robot handover scenes to generate
robot demonstrations containing image-action pairs captured with a camera
mounted on the robot gripper. As a result, the simulated camera pose changes in
the reconstructed scene can be directly translated into gripper pose changes.
We train a robot policy on demonstrations collected with 16 household objects
and {\em directly} deploy this policy in the real environment. Experiments in
both Gaussian Splatting reconstructed scene and real-world human-to-robot
handover experiments demonstrate that H2RH-SGS serves as a new and effective
representation for the human-to-robot handover task.

Motivation: 医疗数据标注劳动密集且隐私敏感，导致高质量标注数据稀缺，现有集中式方法又可能侵犯隐私。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在差分隐私保护下表现优异，能有效诊断不同结构、类别和分布的呼吸系统疾病数据。

Conclusion: 该框架成功解决了数据不足和隐私保护问题，为呼吸系统疾病诊断提供了可行方案。

Abstract: The labor-intensive nature of medical data annotation presents a significant
challenge for respiratory disease diagnosis, resulting in a scarcity of
high-quality labeled datasets in resource-constrained settings. Moreover,
patient privacy concerns complicate the direct sharing of local medical data
across institutions, and existing centralized data-driven approaches, which
rely on amounts of available data, often compromise data privacy. This study
proposes a federated few-shot learning framework with privacy-preserving
mechanisms to address the issues of limited labeled data and privacy protection
in diagnosing respiratory diseases. In particular, a meta-stochastic gradient
descent algorithm is proposed to mitigate the overfitting problem that arises
from insufficient data when employing traditional gradient descent methods for
neural network training. Furthermore, to ensure data privacy against gradient
leakage, differential privacy noise from a standard Gaussian distribution is
integrated into the gradients during the training of private models with local
data, thereby preventing the reconstruction of medical images. Given the
impracticality of centralizing respiratory disease data dispersed across
various medical institutions, a weighted average algorithm is employed to
aggregate local diagnostic models from different clients, enhancing the
adaptability of a model across diverse scenarios. Experimental results show
that the proposed method yields compelling results with the implementation of
differential privacy, while effectively diagnosing respiratory diseases using
data from different structures, categories, and distributions.

Motivation: 尽管TPE在深度学习领域的超参数优化（HPO）中表现优异，但在组合优化方面的应用尚未充分探索，而组合优化在化学和生物学等领域具有重要意义。

Method: 通过将分类核与数值核结合，并引入距离结构，改进了TPE的分类核。同时，针对大规模组合搜索空间优化了核计算的时间复杂度。

Result: 实验表明，改进后的TPE在合成问题上能以更少的评估次数找到更优解。

Conclusion: 改进后的TPE算法在组合优化中表现优异，并已集成到开源HPO框架Optuna中。

Abstract: Tree-structured Parzen estimator (TPE) is a versatile hyperparameter
optimization (HPO) method supported by popular HPO tools. Since these HPO tools
have been developed in line with the trend of deep learning (DL), the problem
setups often used in the DL domain have been discussed for TPE such as
multi-objective optimization and multi-fidelity optimization. However, the
practical applications of HPO are not limited to DL, and black-box
combinatorial optimization is actively utilized in some domains, e.g.,
chemistry and biology. As combinatorial optimization has been an untouched, yet
very important, topic in TPE, we propose an efficient combinatorial
optimization algorithm for TPE. In this paper, we first generalize the
categorical kernel with the numerical kernel in TPE, enabling us to introduce a
distance structure to the categorical kernel. Then we discuss modifications for
the newly developed kernel to handle a large combinatorial search space. These
modifications reduce the time complexity of the kernel calculation with respect
to the size of a combinatorial search space. In the experiments using synthetic
problems, we verified that our proposed method identifies better solutions with
fewer evaluations than the original TPE. Our algorithm is available in Optuna,
an open-source framework for HPO.

Motivation: 现有方法如DPO和REBEL只能从偏好对或相对信号中学习，而在线算法如PPO和GRPO需要复杂实现。QRPO旨在填补这一空白，提供一种简单且适用于离线的解决方案。

Method: QRPO通过分位数奖励实现KL正则化RL目标的闭式解回归，避免了相对信号的需求，并支持预计算扩展。

Result: QRPO在聊天和编码评估中表现优于DPO、REBEL和SimPO，且在奖励模型评分、AlpacaEval 2和LeetCode等任务中表现一致。

Conclusion: QRPO不仅简化了学习过程，还减少了长度偏差，为利用绝对奖励的离线学习提供了高效方法。

Abstract: Aligning large language models with pointwise absolute rewards has so far
required online, on-policy algorithms such as PPO and GRPO. In contrast,
simpler methods that can leverage offline or off-policy data, such as DPO and
REBEL, are limited to learning from preference pairs or relative signals. To
bridge this gap, we introduce \emph{Quantile Reward Policy Optimization}
(QRPO), which learns from pointwise absolute rewards while preserving the
simplicity and offline applicability of DPO-like methods. QRPO uses quantile
rewards to enable regression to the closed-form solution of the KL-regularized
RL objective. This reward yields an analytically tractable partition function,
removing the need for relative signals to cancel this term. Moreover, QRPO
scales with increased compute to estimate quantile rewards, opening a new
dimension for pre-computation scaling. Empirically, QRPO consistently achieves
top performance on chat and coding evaluations -- reward model scores,
AlpacaEval 2, and LeetCode -- compared to DPO, REBEL, and SimPO across diverse
datasets and 8B-scale models. Finally, we find that training with robust
rewards instead of converting them to preferences induces less length bias.

Motivation: 解决现有方法在固定子空间或计算成本高的问题，提出动态更新的低秩优化方法。

Method: 动态维护低秩SVD表示的一阶动量，实现内存高效微调。

Result: 在语言模型对齐任务中表现优异，内存占用与LoRA相当。

Conclusion: MoFaSGD在内存和性能间取得平衡，理论证明其收敛性。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large foundation models presents significant memory challenges
due to stateful optimizers like AdamW, often requiring several times more GPU
memory than inference. While memory-efficient methods like parameter-efficient
fine-tuning (e.g., LoRA) and optimizer state compression exist, recent
approaches like GaLore bridge these by using low-rank gradient projections and
subspace moment accumulation. However, such methods may struggle with fixed
subspaces or computationally costly offline resampling (e.g., requiring
full-matrix SVDs). We propose Momentum Factorized SGD (MoFaSGD), which
maintains a dynamically updated low-rank SVD representation of the first-order
momentum, closely approximating its full-rank counterpart throughout training.
This factorization enables a memory-efficient fine-tuning method that
adaptively updates the optimization subspace at each iteration. Crucially,
MoFaSGD leverages the computed low-rank momentum factors to perform efficient
spectrally normalized updates, offering an alternative to subspace moment
accumulation. We establish theoretical convergence guarantees for MoFaSGD,
proving it achieves an optimal rate for non-convex stochastic optimization
under standard assumptions. Empirically, we demonstrate MoFaSGD's effectiveness
on large language model alignment benchmarks, achieving a competitive trade-off
between memory reduction (comparable to LoRA) and performance compared to
state-of-the-art low-rank optimization methods. Our implementation is available
at https://github.com/pmahdavi/MoFaSGD.

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a powerful framework
for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) by embedding physical
constraints into the loss function. However, standard optimizers such as Adam
often struggle to balance competing loss terms, particularly in stiff or
ill-conditioned systems. In this work, we propose a PDE-aware optimizer that
adapts parameter updates based on the variance of per-sample PDE residual
gradients. This method addresses gradient misalignment without incurring the
heavy computational costs of second-order optimizers such as SOAP. We benchmark
the PDE-aware optimizer against Adam and SOAP on 1D Burgers', Allen-Cahn and
Korteweg-de Vries(KdV) equations. Across both PDEs, the PDE-aware optimizer
achieves smoother convergence and lower absolute errors, particularly in
regions with sharp gradients. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of PDE
residual-aware adaptivity in enhancing stability in PINNs training. While
promising, further scaling on larger architectures and hardware accelerators
remains an important direction for future research.

Conclusion: QRPINNs通过改进采样方法，在高维PDE问题中表现出色，且与自适应采样结合效果更佳。

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks have shown promise in solving partial
differential equations (PDEs) by integrating physical constraints into neural
network training, but their performance is sensitive to the sampling of points.
Based on the impressive performance of quasi Monte-Carlo methods in high
dimensional problems, this paper proposes Quasi-Random Physics-Informed Neural
Networks (QRPINNs), which use low-discrepancy sequences for sampling instead of
random points directly from the domain. Theoretically, QRPINNs have been proven
to have a better convergence rate than PINNs. Empirically, experiments
demonstrate that QRPINNs significantly outperform PINNs and some representative
adaptive sampling methods, especially in high-dimensional PDEs. Furthermore,
combining QRPINNs with adaptive sampling can further improve the performance.

Conclusion: KKT-Hardnet为复杂系统的可靠混合建模提供了新方法，能够有效整合领域知识。

Abstract: Traditional physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) do not guarantee strict
constraint satisfaction. This is problematic in engineering systems where minor
violations of governing laws can significantly degrade the reliability and
consistency of model predictions. In this work, we develop KKT-Hardnet, a PINN
architecture that enforces both linear and nonlinear equality and inequality
constraints up to machine precision. It leverages a projection onto the
feasible region through solving Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions of a
distance minimization problem. Furthermore, we reformulate the nonlinear KKT
conditions using log-exponential transformation to construct a general sparse
system with only linear and exponential terms, thereby making the projection
differentiable. We apply KKT-Hardnet on both test problems and a real-world
chemical process simulation. Compared to multilayer perceptrons and PINNs,
KKT-Hardnet achieves higher accuracy and strict constraint satisfaction. This
approach allows the integration of domain knowledge into machine learning
towards reliable hybrid modeling of complex systems.

Abstract: Traffic accidents are rare, yet high-impact events that require long-context
multimodal reasoning for accurate risk forecasting. In this paper, we introduce
ALCo-FM, a unified adaptive long-context foundation model that computes a
volatility pre-score to dynamically select context windows for input data and

Abstract: Machine learning has been proposed as a way to improve educational assessment
by making fine-grained predictions about student performance and learning
relationships between items. One challenge with many machine learning
approaches is incorporating new items, as these approaches rely heavily on
historical data. We develop Text-LENS by extending the LENS partial variational
auto-encoder for educational assessment to leverage item text embeddings, and
explore the impact on predictive performance and generalization to previously
unseen items. We examine performance on two datasets: Eedi, a publicly
available dataset that includes item content, and LLM-Sim, a novel dataset with
test items produced by an LLM. We find that Text-LENS matches LENS' performance
on seen items and improves upon it in a variety of conditions involving unseen
items; it effectively learns student proficiency from and makes predictions
about student performance on new items.

Result: 量子增强SVM在所有情绪类别中表现更优，F1分数超过80%，召回率提升最高达36%。

Conclusion: 量子机器学习结合可穿戴传感器数据，为临床和辅助生活场景提供了无干扰情绪监测的早期基础。

Abstract: We investigate the feasibility of inferring emotional states exclusively from
physiological signals, thereby presenting a privacy-preserving alternative to
conventional facial recognition techniques. We conduct a performance comparison
of classical machine learning algorithms and hybrid quantum machine learning
(QML) methods with a quantum kernel-based model. Our results indicate that the
quantum-enhanced SVM surpasses classical counterparts in classification
performance across all emotion categories, even when trained on limited
datasets. The F1 scores over all classes are over 80% with around a maximum of
36% improvement in the recall values. The integration of wearable sensor data
with quantum machine learning not only enhances accuracy and robustness but
also facilitates unobtrusive emotion recognition. This methodology holds
promise for populations with impaired communication abilities, such as
individuals with Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) and veterans
with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). The findings establish an early
foundation for passive emotional monitoring in clinical and assisted living

Motivation: 随着网络物理系统的互联性和空间分布性增强，确保其对抗不断演变的网络攻击的韧性变得至关重要。当前数据驱动方法存在可解释性和适应性等问题，需要新的解决方案。

Method: 论文提出了三个关键方向：因果图分析、多视图融合和持续因果图学习，这些方法通过揭示时空动态因果关系来改进异常检测。

Conclusion: 论文旨在推动可扩展、自适应、可解释且基于空间的异常检测系统研究，并倡导因果驱动方法应对网络安全威胁。

Abstract: As cyber-physical systems grow increasingly interconnected and spatially
distributed, ensuring their resilience against evolving cyberattacks has become
a critical priority. Spatio-Temporal Anomaly detection plays an important role
in ensuring system security and operational integrity. However, current
data-driven approaches, largely driven by black-box deep learning, face
challenges in interpretability, adaptability to distribution shifts, and
robustness under evolving system dynamics. In this paper, we advocate for a
causal learning perspective to advance anomaly detection in spatially
distributed infrastructures that grounds detection in structural cause-effect
relationships. We identify and formalize three key directions: causal graph
profiling, multi-view fusion, and continual causal graph learning, each
offering distinct advantages in uncovering dynamic cause-effect structures
across time and space. Drawing on real-world insights from systems such as
water treatment infrastructures, we illustrate how causal models provide early
warning signals and root cause attribution, addressing the limitations of
black-box detectors. Looking ahead, we outline the future research agenda
centered on multi-modality, generative AI-driven, and scalable adaptive causal
frameworks. Our objective is to lay a new research trajectory toward scalable,
adaptive, explainable, and spatially grounded anomaly detection systems. We
hope to inspire a paradigm shift in cybersecurity research, promoting
causality-driven approaches to address evolving threats in interconnected
infrastructures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统链式思维方法依赖启发式采样，缺乏对推理转换的结构化建模，限制了推理轨迹的多样性和有效性。

Method: 将链式思维推理建模为马尔可夫决策过程，利用分布强化学习和潜在状态转换进行探索，引入熵正则化和epsilon-greedy策略。

Result: 实验显示在基准推理任务中，推理准确性、多样性和探索效率均有提升。

Conclusion: CTRLS框架通过结构化建模和强化学习，显著提升了链式思维推理的效果。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning enables large language models (LLMs) to
break down complex problems into interpretable intermediate steps,
significantly enhancing model transparency and performance in reasoning tasks.
However, conventional CoT methods rely on heuristic sampling without structured
modeling of reasoning transitions, constraining their ability to systematically
explore and discover diverse and effective reasoning trajectories. In this
work, we introduce CTRLS, a framework that formulates CoT reasoning as a Markov
decision process (MDP) with latent state transitions, enabling principled and
state-aware exploration via distributional reinforcement learning. By modelling
reasoning actions as explicit probability distributions in latent space, our
approach explicitly models epistemic uncertainty, facilitating robust
exploration of the reasoning space. As part of our framework, we introduce an
on-policy reinforcement learning strategy incorporating epsilon-greedy
exploration and entropy-based regularization to iteratively refine latent state
transitions without requiring additional fine-tuning of the underlying LLM.
Theoretical analyses provide evidence lower bounds (ELBO), theoretically
grounding our transition-aware modeling of latent reasoning dynamics. Further
experiments demonstrate improvements in reasoning accuracy, diversity, and
exploration efficiency across benchmark reasoning tasks.

Motivation: 现有攻击方法依赖梯度信息，将离散优化问题松弛为连续空间，导致解远离最优且无法适应不可微目标。

Method: 引入进化算法直接解决离散优化问题，支持黑盒模型和任意目标，无需可微代理损失。

Result: EvA攻击在实验中平均比现有最佳攻击多降低11%的准确率，并展示了设计攻击的潜在能力。

Conclusion: EvA是一种高效、通用的攻击方法，揭示了现有攻击方法的不足和潜在改进空间。

Abstract: Even a slight perturbation in the graph structure can cause a significant
drop in the accuracy of graph neural networks (GNNs). Most existing attacks
leverage gradient information to perturb edges. This relaxes the attack's
optimization problem from a discrete to a continuous space, resulting in
solutions far from optimal. It also restricts the adaptability of the attack to
non-differentiable objectives. Instead, we introduce a few simple yet effective
enhancements of an evolutionary-based algorithm to solve the discrete
optimization problem directly. Our Evolutionary Attack (EvA) works with any
black-box model and objective, eliminating the need for a differentiable proxy
loss. This allows us to design two novel attacks that reduce the effectiveness
of robustness certificates and break conformal sets. The memory complexity of
our attack is linear in the attack budget. Among our experiments, EvA shows
$\sim$11\% additional drop in accuracy on average compared to the best previous
attack, revealing significant untapped potential in designing attacks.

Result: 在海上夺旗任务中，SPLASH显著优于现有方法，实现了从次优演示中高效学习奖励。

Conclusion: SPLASH填补了逆强化学习在长时程和对抗性任务中的不足，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) presents a powerful paradigm for
learning complex robotic tasks from human demonstrations. However, most
approaches make the assumption that expert demonstrations are available, which
is often not the case. Those that allow for suboptimality in the demonstrations
are not designed for long-horizon goals or adversarial tasks. Many desirable
robot capabilities fall into one or both of these categories, thus highlighting
a critical shortcoming in the ability of IRL to produce field-ready robotic
agents. We introduce Sample-efficient Preference-based inverse reinforcement
learning for Long-horizon Adversarial tasks from Suboptimal Hierarchical
demonstrations (SPLASH), which advances the state-of-the-art in learning from
suboptimal demonstrations to long-horizon and adversarial settings. We
empirically validate SPLASH on a maritime capture-the-flag task in simulation,
and demonstrate real-world applicability with sim-to-real translation
experiments on autonomous unmanned surface vehicles. We show that our proposed
methods allow SPLASH to significantly outperform the state-of-the-art in reward
learning from suboptimal demonstrations.

Conclusion: 结合因果发现和LLM生成自然语言，可有效辅助设施管理者理解并解决能源效率问题。

Abstract: Smart buildings generate vast streams of sensor and control data, but
facility managers often lack clear explanations for anomalous energy usage. We
propose InsightBuild, a two-stage framework that integrates causality analysis
with a fine-tuned large language model (LLM) to provide human-readable, causal
explanations of energy consumption patterns. First, a lightweight causal
inference module applies Granger causality tests and structural causal
discovery on building telemetry (e.g., temperature, HVAC settings, occupancy)
drawn from Google Smart Buildings and Berkeley Office datasets. Next, an LLM,
fine-tuned on aligned pairs of sensor-level causes and textual explanations,
receives as input the detected causal relations and generates concise,
actionable explanations. We evaluate InsightBuild on two real-world datasets
(Google: 2017-2022; Berkeley: 2018-2020), using expert-annotated ground-truth
causes for a held-out set of anomalies. Our results demonstrate that combining
explicit causal discovery with LLM-based natural language generation yields
clear, precise explanations that assist facility managers in diagnosing and
mitigating energy inefficiencies.

Abstract: Human state detection and behavior prediction have seen significant
advancements with the rise of machine learning and multimodal sensing
technologies. However, predicting prosocial behavior intentions in mobility
scenarios, such as helping others on the road, is an underexplored area.
Current research faces a major limitation. There are no large, labeled datasets
available for prosocial behavior, and small-scale datasets make it difficult to
train deep-learning models effectively. To overcome this, we propose a
self-supervised learning approach that harnesses multi-modal data from existing
physiological and behavioral datasets. By pre-training our model on diverse
tasks and fine-tuning it with a smaller, manually labeled prosocial behavior
dataset, we significantly enhance its performance. This method addresses the
data scarcity issue, providing a more effective benchmark for prosocial
behavior prediction, and offering valuable insights for improving intelligent
vehicle systems and human-machine interaction.

Abstract: Estimating the score function (or other population-density-dependent
functions) is a fundamental component of most generative models. However, such
function estimation is computationally and statistically challenging. Can we
avoid function estimation for data generation? We propose an estimation-free
generative method: A set of points whose locations are deterministically
updated with (inverse) gradient descent can transport a uniform distribution to
arbitrary data distribution, in the mean field regime, without function
estimation, training neural networks, and even noise injection. The proposed
method is built upon recent advances in the physics of interacting particles.
We show, both theoretically and experimentally, that these advances can be
leveraged to develop novel generative methods.

Abstract: Density and geometry have long served as two of the fundamental guiding
principles in clustering algorithm design, with algorithm usually focusing
either on the density structure of the data (e.g., HDBSCAN and Density Peak
Clustering) or the complexity of underlying geometry (e.g., manifold clustering
algorithms).
  In this paper, we identify and formalize a recurring but often overlooked
interaction between distribution and geometry and leverage this insight to
design our clustering enhancement framework CoreSPECT (Core Space
Projection-based Enhancement of Clustering Techniques). Our framework boosts
the performance of simple algorithms like K-Means and GMM by applying them to
strategically selected regions, then extending the partial partition to a
complete partition for the dataset using a novel neighborhood graph based
multi-layer propagation procedure.
  We apply our framework on 15 datasets from three different domains and obtain
consistent and substantial gain in clustering accuracy for both K-Means and
GMM. On average, our framework improves the ARI of K-Means by 40% and of GMM by
14%, often surpassing the performance of both manifold-based and recent
density-based clustering algorithms. We further support our framework with
initial theoretical guarantees, ablation to demonstrate the usefulness of the
individual steps and with evidence of robustness to noise.

Abstract: Missing data presents a critical challenge in real-world datasets,
significantly degrading the performance of machine learning models. While Large
Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
tabular data imputation, exemplified by frameworks like UnIMP, their reliance
on classical embedding methods often limits their ability to capture complex,
non-linear correlations, particularly in mixed-type data scenarios encompassing
numerical, categorical, and textual features. This paper introduces
Quantum-UnIMP, a novel framework that integrates shallow quantum circuits into
an LLM-based imputation architecture. Our core innovation lies in replacing
conventional classical input embeddings with quantum feature maps generated by
an Instantaneous Quantum Polynomial (IQP) circuit. This approach enables the
model to leverage quantum phenomena such as superposition and entanglement,
thereby learning richer, more expressive representations of data and enhancing
the recovery of intricate missingness patterns. Our experiments on benchmark
mixed-type datasets demonstrate that Quantum-UnIMP reduces imputation error by
up to 15.2% for numerical features (RMSE) and improves classification accuracy
by 8.7% for categorical features (F1-Score) compared to state-of-the-art
classical and LLM-based methods. These compelling results underscore the
profound potential of quantum-enhanced representations for complex data
imputation tasks, even with near-term quantum hardware.

Abstract: Enhancing the mathematical reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs) is a
pivotal challenge in advancing AI capabilities. While Supervised Fine-Tuning
(SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) are the dominant training paradigms, a
systematic methodology for combining them to maximize both accuracy and
efficiency remains largely unexplored. This paper introduces a practical and
effective training recipe that strategically integrates extended SFT with RL
from online inference (GRPO). We posit that these methods play complementary,
not competing, roles: a prolonged SFT phase first pushes the model's accuracy
to its limits, after which a GRPO phase dramatically improves token efficiency
while preserving this peak performance. Our experiments reveal that extending
SFT for as many as 10 epochs is crucial for performance breakthroughs, and that
the primary role of GRPO in this framework is to optimize solution length. The
efficacy of our recipe is rigorously validated through top-tier performance on
challenging benchmarks, including a high rank among over 2,200 teams in the
strictly leak-free AI Mathematical Olympiad (AIMO). This work provides the
community with a battle-tested blueprint for developing state-of-the-art
mathematical reasoners that are both exceptionally accurate and practically
efficient. To ensure full reproducibility and empower future research, we will

Abstract: Dimensional synthesis of planar four-bar mechanisms is a challenging inverse
problem in kinematics, requiring the determination of mechanism dimensions from
desired motion specifications. We propose a data-driven framework that bypasses
traditional equation-solving and optimization by leveraging supervised
learning. Our method combines a synthetic dataset, an LSTM-based neural network
for handling sequential precision points, and a Mixture of Experts (MoE)
architecture tailored to different linkage types. Each expert model is trained
on type-specific data and guided by a type-specifying layer, enabling both
single-type and multi-type synthesis. A novel simulation metric evaluates
prediction quality by comparing desired and generated motions. Experiments show
our approach produces accurate, defect-free linkages across various
configurations. This enables intuitive and efficient mechanism design, even for
non-expert users, and opens new possibilities for scalable and flexible

Abstract: We introduce a lightweight yet highly effective safety guardrail framework
for language models, demonstrating that small-scale language models can
achieve, and even surpass, the performance of larger counterparts in content
moderation tasks. This is accomplished through high-fidelity synthetic data
generation and adversarial training. The synthetic data generation process
begins with human-curated seed data, which undergoes query augmentation and
paraphrasing to create diverse and contextually rich examples. This augmented
data is then subjected to multiple rounds of curation, ensuring high fidelity
and relevance. Inspired by recent advances in the Generative Adversarial
Network (GAN) architecture, our adversarial training employs reinforcement
learning to guide a generator that produces challenging synthetic examples.
These examples are used to fine-tune the safety classifier, enhancing its
ability to detect and mitigate harmful content. Additionally, we incorporate
strategies from recent research on efficient LLM training, leveraging the
capabilities of smaller models to improve the performance of larger generative
models. With iterative adversarial training and the generation of diverse,
high-quality synthetic data, our framework enables small language models (SLMs)
to serve as robust safety guardrails. This approach not only reduces
computational overhead but also enhances resilience against adversarial
attacks, offering a scalable and efficient solution for content moderation in
AI systems.

Abstract: Clustering is a critical component of decision-making in todays data-driven
environments. It has been widely used in a variety of fields such as
bioinformatics, social network analysis, and image processing. However,
clustering accuracy remains a major challenge in large datasets. This paper
presents a comprehensive overview of strategies for selecting the optimal value
of k in clustering, with a focus on achieving a balance between clustering
precision and computational efficiency in complex data environments. In

method, along with statistical methods such as Local Structures, Gap
Statistics, Class Consistency Ratio, and a Cluster Overlap Index CCR and
COIbased algorithm to calculate the best value of k for K-Means clustering. The
results of comparative experiments show that the proposed approach achieves up
to 99 percent faster execution times on high-dimensional datasets while
retaining both precision and scalability, making it highly suitable for real
time clustering needs or scenarios demanding efficient clustering with minimal
resource utilization.

Conclusion: CA-QNN在云工作负载预测中表现出卓越的准确性和效率，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Accurate workload prediction and advanced resource reservation are
indispensably crucial for managing dynamic cloud services. Traditional neural
networks and deep learning models frequently encounter challenges with diverse,
high-dimensional workloads, especially during sudden resource demand changes,
leading to inefficiencies. This issue arises from their limited optimization
during training, relying only on parametric (inter-connection weights)
adjustments using conventional algorithms. To address this issue, this work
proposes a novel Comprehensively Adaptive Architectural Optimization-based
Variable Quantum Neural Network (CA-QNN), which combines the efficiency of
quantum computing with complete structural and qubit vector parametric
learning. The model converts workload data into qubits, processed through qubit
neurons with Controlled NOT-gated activation functions for intuitive pattern
recognition. In addition, a comprehensive architecture optimization algorithm
for networks is introduced to facilitate the learning and propagation of the
structure and parametric values in variable-sized QNNs. This algorithm
incorporates quantum adaptive modulation and size-adaptive recombination during
training process. The performance of CA-QNN model is thoroughly investigated
against seven state-of-the-art methods across four benchmark datasets of
heterogeneous cloud workloads. The proposed model demonstrates superior
prediction accuracy, reducing prediction errors by up to 93.40% and 91.27%
compared to existing deep learning and QNN-based approaches.

Conclusion: scE2TM为单细胞RNA-seq数据分析提供了高质量的嵌入和强解释性。

Abstract: Recent advances in sequencing technologies have enabled researchers to
explore cellular heterogeneity at single-cell resolution. Meanwhile,
interpretability has gained prominence parallel to the rapid increase in the
complexity and performance of deep learning models. In recent years, topic
models have been widely used for interpretable single-cell embedding learning
and clustering analysis, which we refer to as single-cell embedded topic
models. However, previous studies evaluated the interpretability of the models
mainly through qualitative analysis, and these single-cell embedded topic
models suffer from the potential problem of interpretation collapse.
Furthermore, their neglect of external biological knowledge constrains
analytical performance. Here, we present scE2TM, an external knowledge-guided
single-cell embedded topic model that provides a high-quality cell embedding
and strong interpretation, contributing to comprehensive scRNA-seq data
analysis. Our comprehensive evaluation across 20 scRNA-seq datasets
demonstrates that scE2TM achieves significant clustering performance gains
compared to 7 state-of-the-art methods. In addition, we propose a new
interpretability evaluation benchmark that introduces 10 metrics to
quantitatively assess the interpretability of single-cell embedded topic
models. The results show that the interpretation provided by scE2TM performs
encouragingly in terms of diversity and consistency with the underlying
biological signals, contributing to a better revealing of the underlying
biological mechanisms.

Conclusion: 该方法通过改进数据集和模型训练，显著提升了BPMN模型提取的效率和准确性。

Abstract: Efficient planning, resource management, and consistent operations often rely
on converting textual process documents into formal Business Process Model and
Notation (BPMN) models. However, this conversion process remains time-intensive
and costly. Existing approaches, whether rule-based or machine-learning-based,
still struggle with writing styles and often fail to identify parallel
structures in process descriptions.
  This paper introduces an automated pipeline for extracting BPMN models from
text, leveraging the use of machine learning and large language models. A key
contribution of this work is the introduction of a newly annotated dataset,
which significantly enhances the training process. Specifically, we augment the
PET dataset with 15 newly annotated documents containing 32 parallel gateways
for model training, a critical feature often overlooked in existing datasets.
This addition enables models to better capture parallel structures, a common
but complex aspect of process descriptions. The proposed approach demonstrates
adequate performance in terms of reconstruction accuracy, offering a promising
foundation for organizations to accelerate BPMN model creation.

Abstract: Lane changes of preceding vehicles have a great impact on the motion planning
of automated vehicles especially in complex traffic situations. Predicting them
would benefit the public in terms of safety and efficiency. While many research
efforts have been made in this direction, few concentrated on predicting
maneuvers within a set time interval compared to predicting at a set prediction
time. In addition, there exist a lack of comparisons between different
architectures to try to determine the best performing one and to assess how to
correctly choose the input for such models. In this paper the structure of an
LSTM, a CNN and a Transformer network are described and implemented to predict
the intention of human drivers to perform a lane change. We show how the data
was prepared starting from a publicly available dataset (highD), which features
were used, how the networks were designed and finally we compare the results of
the three networks with different configurations of input data. We found that
transformer networks performed better than the other networks and was less
affected by overfitting. The accuracy of the method spanned from $82.79\%$ to
$96.73\%$ for different input configurations and showed overall good
performances considering also precision and recall.

Abstract: Quantum Machine Learning (QML) represents a promising frontier at the
intersection of quantum computing and artificial intelligence, aiming to
leverage quantum computational advantages to enhance data-driven tasks. This
review explores the potential of QML to address the computational bottlenecks
of classical machine learning, particularly in processing complex datasets. We
introduce the theoretical foundations of QML, including quantum data encoding,
quantum learning theory and optimization techniques, while categorizing QML
approaches based on data type and computational architecture. It is
well-established that quantum computational advantages are problem-dependent,
and so potentially useful directions for QML need to be systematically
identified. Key developments, such as Quantum Principal Component Analysis,
quantum-enhanced sensing and applications in material science, are critically
evaluated for their theoretical speed-ups and practical limitations. The
challenges posed by Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices, including
hardware noise, scalability constraints and data encoding overheads, are
discussed in detail. We also outline future directions, emphasizing the need
for quantum-native algorithms, improved error correction, and realistic
benchmarks to bridge the gap between theoretical promise and practical
deployment. This comprehensive analysis underscores that while QML has
significant potential for specific applications such as quantum chemistry and
sensing, its broader utility in real-world scenarios remains contingent on
overcoming technological and methodological hurdles.

Abstract: Cluster analysis is a fundamental research issue in statistics and machine
learning. In many modern clustering methods, we need to determine whether two
subsets of samples come from the same cluster. Since these subsets are usually
generated by certain clustering procedures, the deployment of classic
two-sample tests in this context would yield extremely smaller p-values,
leading to inflated Type-I error rate. To overcome this bias, we formally
introduce the two-cluster test issue and argue that it is a totally different
significance testing issue from conventional two-sample test. Meanwhile, we
present a new method based on the boundary points between two subsets to derive
an analytical p-value for the purpose of significance quantification.
Experiments on both synthetic and real data sets show that the proposed test is
able to significantly reduce the Type-I error rate, in comparison with several
classic two-sample testing methods. More importantly, the practical usage of
such two-cluster test is further verified through its applications in
tree-based interpretable clustering and significance-based hierarchical
clustering.

Abstract: Offline-to-online reinforcement learning (RL) aims to integrate the
complementary strengths of offline and online RL by pre-training an agent
offline and subsequently fine-tuning it through online interactions. However,
recent studies reveal that offline pre-trained agents often underperform during
online fine-tuning due to inaccurate value estimation caused by distribution
shift, with random initialization proving more effective in certain cases. In
this work, we propose a novel method, Online Pre-Training for Offline-to-Online
RL (OPT), explicitly designed to address the issue of inaccurate value
estimation in offline pre-trained agents. OPT introduces a new learning phase,
Online Pre-Training, which allows the training of a new value function tailored
specifically for effective online fine-tuning. Implementation of OPT on TD3 and
SPOT demonstrates an average 30% improvement in performance across a wide range
of D4RL environments, including MuJoCo, Antmaze, and Adroit.

Abstract: Discrete diffusion models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for language
modeling, rivaling auto-regressive models by training-time scaling. However,
inference-time scaling in discrete diffusion models remains relatively
under-explored. In this work, we study sampling-based approaches for achieving
high-quality text generation from discrete diffusion models in reward-guided
settings. We introduce a novel inference-time scaling approach based on
particle Gibbs sampling for discrete diffusion models. The particle Gibbs
sampling algorithm iteratively refines full diffusion trajectories using
conditional Sequential Monte Carlo as its transition mechanism. This process
ensures that the updated samples progressively improve and move closer to the
reward-weighted target distribution. Unlike existing inference-time scaling
methods, which are often limited to single diffusion trajectories, our approach
leverages iterative refinement across multiple trajectories. Within this
framework, we further analyze the trade-offs between four key axes for
inference-time scaling under fixed compute budgets: particle Gibbs iterations,
particle count, denoising steps, and reward estimation cost. Empirically, our
method consistently outperforms prior inference-time strategies on
reward-guided text generation tasks, achieving significant improvement in
accuracy under varying compute budgets.

Abstract: Random telegraph noise is a prevalent variability phenomenon in
nanoelectronic devices, arising from stochastic carrier exchange at defect
sites and critically impacting device reliability and performance. Conventional
analysis techniques often rely on restrictive assumptions or manual
interventions, limiting their applicability to complex, noisy datasets. Here,
we introduce RTNinja, a generalized, fully automated machine learning framework
for the unsupervised analysis of random telegraph noise signals. RTNinja
deconvolves complex signals to identify the number and characteristics of
hidden individual sources, without requiring prior knowledge of the system. The
framework comprises two modular components: LevelsExtractor, which uses
Bayesian inference and model selection to denoise and discretize the signal;
and SourcesMapper, which infers source configurations through probabilistic
clustering and optimization. To evaluate performance, we developed a Monte
Carlo simulator that generates labeled datasets spanning broad signal-to-noise
ratios and source complexities; across 7000 such datasets, RTNinja consistently
demonstrated high-fidelity signal reconstruction and accurate extraction of
source amplitudes and activity patterns. Our results demonstrate that RTNinja
offers a robust, scalable, and device-agnostic tool for random telegraph noise
characterization, enabling large-scale statistical benchmarking,
reliability-centric technology qualification, predictive failure modeling, and
device physics exploration in next-generation nanoelectronics.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances language models by grounding
responses in external information, yet explainability remains a critical
challenge, particularly when retrieval relies on unstructured text. Knowledge
graphs (KGs) offer a solution by introducing structured, semantically rich
representations of entities and their relationships, enabling transparent
retrieval paths and interpretable reasoning. In this work, we present KGRAG-Ex,
a RAG system that improves both factual grounding and explainability by
leveraging a domain-specific KG constructed via prompt-based information
extraction. Given a user query, KGRAG-Ex identifies relevant entities and
semantic paths in the graph, which are then transformed into pseudo-paragraphs:
natural language representations of graph substructures that guide corpus
retrieval. To improve interpretability and support reasoning transparency, we
incorporate perturbation-based explanation methods that assess the influence of
specific KG-derived components on the generated answers. We conduct a series of
experiments to analyze the sensitivity of the system to different perturbation
methods, the relationship between graph component importance and their
structural positions, the influence of semantic node types, and how graph
metrics correspond to the influence of components within the explanations
process.

Abstract: Multilayer perceptron (MLP), one of the most fundamental neural networks, is
extensively utilized for classification and regression tasks. In this paper, we
establish a new generalization error bound, which reveals how the variance of
empirical loss influences the generalization ability of the learning model.
Inspired by this learning bound, we advocate to reduce the variance of
empirical loss to enhance the ability of MLP. As is well-known, bagging is a
popular ensemble method to realize variance reduction. However, bagging
produces the base training data sets by the Simple Random Sampling (SRS)
method, which exhibits a high degree of randomness. To handle this issue, we
introduce an ordered structure in the training data set by Rank Set Sampling
(RSS) to further reduce the variance of loss and develop a RSS-MLP method.
Theoretical results show that the variance of empirical exponential loss and
the logistic loss estimated by RSS are smaller than those estimated by SRS,
respectively. To validate the performance of RSS-MLP, we conduct comparison
experiments on twelve benchmark data sets in terms of the two convex loss
functions under two fusion methods. Extensive experimental results and analysis
illustrate the effectiveness and rationality of the propose method.

Abstract: Optimizers play a decisive role in reducing pre-training times for LLMs and
achieving better-performing models. In this study, we compare three major
variants: the de-facto standard AdamW, the simpler Lion, developed through an
evolutionary search, and the second-order optimizer Sophia. For better
generalization, we train with two different base architectures and use a
single- and a multiple-epoch approach while keeping the number of tokens
constant. Using the Maximal Update Parametrization and smaller proxy models, we
tune relevant hyperparameters separately for each combination of base
architecture and optimizer. We found that while the results from all three
optimizers were in approximately the same range, Sophia exhibited the lowest
training and validation loss, Lion was fastest in terms of training GPU hours
but AdamW led to the best downstream evaluation results.

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) and transcoders have become important tools for
machine learning interpretability. However, measuring how interpretable they
are remains challenging, with weak consensus about which benchmarks to use.
Most evaluation procedures start by producing a single-sentence explanation for
each latent. These explanations are then evaluated based on how well they
enable an LLM to predict the activation of a latent in new contexts. This
method makes it difficult to disentangle the explanation generation and
evaluation process from the actual interpretability of the latents discovered.
In this work, we adapt existing methods to assess the interpretability of
sparse coders, with the advantage that they do not require generating natural
language explanations as an intermediate step. This enables a more direct and
potentially standardized assessment of interpretability. Furthermore, we
compare the scores produced by our interpretability metrics with human
evaluations across similar tasks and varying setups, offering suggestions for
the community on improving the evaluation of these techniques.

TL;DR: SynBridge是一种基于双向流的生成模型，用于多任务反应预测，通过图到图转换网络和离散流桥实现化学反应的双向转换。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 化学反应的本质是电子的重新分布和重组，通常表现为电子转移或电子对的迁移。这些变化在物理世界中是离散且突然的，如原子电荷状态的变化或化学键的形成与断裂。

Method: SynBridge采用图到图转换网络架构和离散流桥，通过原子和键的离散状态捕获反应物和产物之间的双向化学转换。

Result: 在三个基准数据集（USPTO-50K、USPTO-MIT、Pistachio）上进行了广泛实验，证明了SynBridge在正向和逆向合成任务中的最先进性能。

Conclusion: 消融研究和噪声调度分析表明，离散空间上的结构化扩散对反应预测有益。

Abstract: The essence of a chemical reaction lies in the redistribution and
reorganization of electrons, which is often manifested through electron
transfer or the migration of electron pairs. These changes are inherently
discrete and abrupt in the physical world, such as alterations in the charge
states of atoms or the formation and breaking of chemical bonds. To model the
transition of states, we propose SynBridge, a bidirectional flow-based
generative model to achieve multi-task reaction prediction. By leveraging a
graph-to-graph transformer network architecture and discrete flow bridges
between any two discrete distributions, SynBridge captures bidirectional
chemical transformations between graphs of reactants and products through the
bonds' and atoms' discrete states. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of
our method through extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets
(USPTO-50K, USPTO-MIT, Pistachio), achieving state-of-the-art performance in
both forward and retrosynthesis tasks. Our ablation studies and noise
scheduling analysis reveal the benefits of structured diffusion over discrete
spaces for reaction prediction.

Result: CPU资源在生成令牌时过度使用，GPU和NPU利用不足或饱和，导致设备响应性下降。

Conclusion: 当前部署框架存在CPU过度使用和GPU/NPU利用不稳定的问题，需优化硬件资源分配。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer promising capabilities for mobile
devices, but their deployment faces significant challenges due to computational
limitations and energy inefficiency, especially for real-time applications.
This study provides a comprehensive survey of deployment frameworks for VLMs on
mobile devices, evaluating llama.cpp, MLC-Imp, and mllm in the context of
running LLaVA-1.5 7B, MobileVLM-3B, and Imp-v1.5 3B as representative workloads
on a OnePlus 13R. Each deployment framework was evaluated on the OnePlus 13R
while running VLMs, with measurements covering CPU, GPU, and NPU utilization,
temperature, inference time, power consumption, and user experience.
Benchmarking revealed critical performance bottlenecks across frameworks: CPU
resources were consistently over-utilized during token generation, while GPU
and NPU accelerators were largely unused. When the GPU was used, primarily for
image feature extraction, it was saturated, leading to degraded device
responsiveness. The study contributes framework-level benchmarks, practical
profiling tools, and an in-depth analysis of hardware utilization bottlenecks,
highlighting the consistent overuse of CPUs and the ineffective or unstable use
of GPUs and NPUs in current deployment frameworks.

TL;DR: SFedKD通过多教师知识蒸馏和细粒度权重分配，解决了顺序联邦学习中的灾难性遗忘问题，并在实验中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 顺序联邦学习（SFL）在数据异构环境下具有强收敛性，但存在灾难性遗忘问题。

Method: 提出SFedKD框架，采用多教师知识蒸馏，基于类别分布差异分配权重，并通过贪心策略选择互补教师模型。

Result: SFedKD有效缓解灾难性遗忘，性能优于现有联邦学习方法。

Conclusion: SFedKD为顺序联邦学习中的灾难性遗忘问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning paradigm which
coordinates multiple clients to collaboratively train a global model via a
central server. Sequential Federated Learning (SFL) is a newly-emerging FL
training framework where the global model is trained in a sequential manner
across clients. Since SFL can provide strong convergence guarantees under data
heterogeneity, it has attracted significant research attention in recent years.
However, experiments show that SFL suffers from severe catastrophic forgetting
in heterogeneous environments, meaning that the model tends to forget knowledge
learned from previous clients. To address this issue, we propose an SFL
framework with discrepancy-aware multi-teacher knowledge distillation, called
SFedKD, which selects multiple models from the previous round to guide the
current round of training. In SFedKD, we extend the single-teacher Decoupled
Knowledge Distillation approach to our multi-teacher setting and assign
distinct weights to teachers' target-class and non-target-class knowledge based
on the class distributional discrepancy between teacher and student data.
Through this fine-grained weighting strategy, SFedKD can enhance model training
efficacy while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Additionally, to prevent
knowledge dilution, we eliminate redundant teachers for the knowledge
distillation and formalize it as a variant of the maximum coverage problem.
Based on the greedy strategy, we design a complementary-based teacher selection
mechanism to ensure that the selected teachers achieve comprehensive knowledge
space coverage while reducing communication and computational costs. Extensive
experiments show that SFedKD effectively overcomes catastrophic forgetting in
SFL and outperforms state-of-the-art FL methods.

TL;DR: 提出一种无需修改奖励函数的强化学习行为对齐方法，通过选择适当的奖励聚合函数实现灵活目标优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习中，复杂目标需要精心设计奖励函数，这具有挑战性。

Method: 引入MDP的代数视角，通过递归生成和聚合奖励，推广标准折扣和至其他递归聚合形式（如折扣最大值和夏普比率）。

Result: 实验证明该方法能有效优化多样目标，适用于确定性和随机环境，并与值基和演员-评论家算法无缝集成。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了灵活性和实际应用潜力，为行为对齐提供了新思路。

Abstract: In reinforcement learning (RL), aligning agent behavior with specific
objectives typically requires careful design of the reward function, which can
be challenging when the desired objectives are complex. In this work, we
propose an alternative approach for flexible behavior alignment that eliminates
the need to modify the reward function by selecting appropriate reward
aggregation functions. By introducing an algebraic perspective on Markov
decision processes (MDPs), we show that the Bellman equations naturally emerge
from the recursive generation and aggregation of rewards, allowing for the
generalization of the standard discounted sum to other recursive aggregations,
such as discounted max and Sharpe ratio. Our approach applies to both
deterministic and stochastic settings and integrates seamlessly with
value-based and actor-critic algorithms. Experimental results demonstrate that
our approach effectively optimizes diverse objectives, highlighting its
versatility and potential for real-world applications.

TL;DR: 提出CircFormerMoE框架，基于transformer和混合专家模型，直接从植物基因组DNA预测circRNAs，解决了现有方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有circRNA识别方法依赖RNA实验数据，计算成本高，且不适用于植物基因组；缺乏高效且泛化能力强的深度学习模型。

Method: CircFormerMoE框架，包含剪接位点检测（SSD）和剪接位点配对（SSP）两个子任务，基于transformer和混合专家模型。

Result: 在10种植物基因数据上验证有效性，能发现未注释的circRNAs，并进行可解释性分析。

Conclusion: CircFormerMoE为植物大规模circRNA发现提供了快速准确的计算方法和工具，为植物功能基因组学和非编码RNA注释奠定基础。

Abstract: Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are important components of the non-coding RNA
regulatory network. Previous circRNA identification primarily relies on
high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data combined with alignment-based
algorithms that detect back-splicing signals. However, these methods face
several limitations: they can't predict circRNAs directly from genomic DNA
sequences and relies heavily on RNA experimental data; they involve high
computational costs due to complex alignment and filtering steps; and they are
inefficient for large-scale or genome-wide circRNA prediction. The challenge is
even greater in plants, where plant circRNA splice sites often lack the
canonical GT-AG motif seen in human mRNA splicing, and no efficient deep
learning model with strong generalization capability currently exists.
Furthermore, the number of currently identified plant circRNAs is likely far
lower than their true abundance. In this paper, we propose a deep learning
framework named CircFormerMoE based on transformers and mixture-of experts for
predicting circRNAs directly from plant genomic DNA. Our framework consists of
two subtasks known as splicing site detection (SSD) and splicing site pairing
(SSP). The model's effectiveness has been validated on gene data of 10 plant
species. Trained on known circRNA instances, it is also capable of discovering
previously unannotated circRNAs. In addition, we performed interpretability
analyses on the trained model to investigate the sequence patterns contributing
to its predictions. Our framework provides a fast and accurate computational
method and tool for large-scale circRNA discovery in plants, laying a
foundation for future research in plant functional genomics and non-coding RNA
annotation.

Result: 在NGSIM和HighD数据集上，平均预测误差分别降低了4.8%和31.2%，尤其在高风险场景中表现更优。

Conclusion: 该框架提供了可解释的风险感知预测，有助于增强自动驾驶系统的决策鲁棒性。

Abstract: Accurate vehicle trajectory prediction is essential for ensuring safety and
efficiency in fully autonomous driving systems. While existing methods
primarily focus on modeling observed motion patterns and interactions with
other vehicles, they often neglect the potential risks posed by the uncertain
or aggressive behaviors of surrounding vehicles. In this paper, we propose a
novel spatial-temporal risk-attentive trajectory prediction framework that
incorporates a risk potential field to assess perceived risks arising from
behaviors of nearby vehicles. The framework leverages a spatial-temporal
encoder and a risk-attentive feature fusion decoder to embed the risk potential
field into the extracted spatial-temporal feature representations for
trajectory prediction. A risk-scaled loss function is further designed to
improve the prediction accuracy of high-risk scenarios, such as short relative
spacing. Experiments on the widely used NGSIM and HighD datasets demonstrate
that our method reduces average prediction errors by 4.8% and 31.2%
respectively compared to state-of-the-art approaches, especially in high-risk
scenarios. The proposed framework provides interpretable, risk-aware
predictions, contributing to more robust decision-making for autonomous driving
systems.

Motivation: 探索一种无需增加参数或数据量的方法，通过递归和动态计算资源分配提升Transformer性能。

Method: 提出Autoregressive Block-Based Iterative Encoder (AbbIE)，在潜在空间进行迭代，无需特殊数据集或训练协议。

Result: AbbIE在零样本上下文学习任务中提升12%，语言困惑度提升5%，且能动态适应任务复杂度。

Conclusion: AbbIE为Transformer性能扩展提供了新途径，展示了递归和动态计算的优势。

Abstract: We introduce the Autoregressive Block-Based Iterative Encoder (AbbIE), a
novel recursive generalization of the encoder-only Transformer architecture,
which achieves better perplexity than a standard Transformer and allows for the
dynamic scaling of compute resources at test time. This simple, recursive
approach is a complement to scaling large language model (LLM) performance
through parameter and token counts. AbbIE performs its iterations in latent
space, but unlike latent reasoning models, does not require a specialized
dataset or training protocol. We show that AbbIE upward generalizes (ability to
generalize to arbitrary iteration lengths) at test time by only using 2
iterations during train time, far outperforming alternative iterative methods.
AbbIE's ability to scale its computational expenditure based on the complexity
of the task gives it an up to \textbf{12\%} improvement in zero-shot in-context
learning tasks versus other iterative and standard methods and up to 5\%
improvement in language perplexity. The results from this study open a new
avenue to Transformer performance scaling. We perform all of our evaluations on
model sizes up to 350M parameters.

Result: 在五个不同的恶意软件检测数据集上，ADAPT表现优于基线模型和竞争基准。

Conclusion: ADAPT为恶意软件检测中概念漂移的有效适应提供了新途径。

Abstract: Machine learning models are commonly used for malware classification;
however, they suffer from performance degradation over time due to concept
drift. Adapting these models to changing data distributions requires frequent
updates, which rely on costly ground truth annotations. While active learning
can reduce the annotation burden, leveraging unlabeled data through
semi-supervised learning remains a relatively underexplored approach in the
context of malware detection. In this research, we introduce \texttt{ADAPT}, a
novel pseudo-labeling semi-supervised algorithm for addressing concept drift.
Our model-agnostic method can be applied to various machine learning models,
including neural networks and tree-based algorithms. We conduct extensive
experiments on five diverse malware detection datasets spanning Android,
Windows, and PDF domains. The results demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms baseline models and competitive benchmarks. This work paves the way
for more effective adaptation of machine learning models to concept drift in
malware detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水稻种植消耗大量淡水，而可持续灌溉实践（如DSR和AWD）可显著减少用水量，但缺乏数据支持政策制定。

Method: 利用Sentinel-1卫星影像和地面数据，开发分类系统，区分不同灌溉实践。

Result: 模型在区分DSR与传统水稻种植上达到78%的F1分数，并成功在300万农田中映射DSR采用情况。

Conclusion: 该框架为政策制定者提供了追踪可持续水管理实践的工具，支持干预措施和项目评估。

Abstract: Rice cultivation consumes 24-30% of global freshwater, creating critical
water management challenges in major rice-producing regions. Sustainable
irrigation practices like direct seeded rice (DSR) and alternate wetting and
drying (AWD) can reduce water use by 20-40% while maintaining yields, helping
secure long-term agricultural productivity as water scarcity intensifies - a
key component of the Zero Hunger Sustainable Development Goal. However, limited
data on adoption rates of these practices prevents evidence-based policymaking
and targeted resource allocation. We developed a novel remote sensing framework
to monitor sustainable water management practices at scale in Punjab, India - a
region facing severe groundwater depletion of 41.6 cm/year. To collect
essential ground truth data, we partnered with the Nature Conservancy's
Promoting Regenerative and No-burn Agriculture (PRANA) program, which trained
approximately 1,400 farmers on water-saving techniques while documenting their
field-level practices. Using this data, we created a classification system with
Sentinel-1 satellite imagery that separates water management along sowing and
irrigation dimensions. Our approach achieved a 78% F1-score in distinguishing
DSR from traditional puddled transplanted rice without requiring prior
knowledge of planting dates. We demonstrated scalability by mapping DSR
adoption across approximately 3 million agricultural plots in Punjab, with
district-level predictions showing strong correlation (Pearson=0.77, RBO= 0.77)
with government records. This study provides policymakers with a powerful tool
to track sustainable water management adoption, target interventions, and
measure program impacts at scale.

Motivation: 由于现有标注数据集已被用于训练大型视觉语言模型（VLMs），提升性能变得困难，因此探索无监督图像描述方法具有重要意义。

Method: 提出LoGIC方法，包含两个智能体（'speaker'和'listener'），通过GRPO算法在协作共同奖励设置中训练，学习自然语言交流策略。

Result: 使用预训练VLMs和LLM，LoGIC在无额外标注下达到46 BLEU分，优于基线VLM的44分；轻量级组件版本在无监督设置中达到31 BLEU分，优于现有方法10分。

Conclusion: LoGIC通过多智能体强化学习有效提升了无监督图像描述任务的性能，展示了其潜在应用价值。

Abstract: Image captioning is an important problem in developing various AI systems,
and these tasks require large volumes of annotated images to train the models.
Since all existing labelled datasets are already used for training the large
Vision Language Models (VLMs), it becomes challenging to improve the
performance of the same. Considering this, it is essential to consider the
unsupervised image captioning performance, which remains relatively
under-explored. To that end, we propose LoGIC (Lewis Communication Game for
Image Captioning), a Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning game. The proposed
method consists of two agents, a 'speaker' and a 'listener', with the objective
of learning a strategy for communicating in natural language. We train agents
in the cooperative common-reward setting using the GRPO algorithm and show that
improvement in image captioning performance emerges as a consequence of the
agents learning to play the game. We show that using pre-trained VLMs as the
'speaker' and Large Language Model (LLM) for language understanding in the
'listener', we achieved a $46$ BLEU score after fine-tuning using LoGIC without
additional labels, a $2$ units advantage in absolute metrics compared to the
$44$ BLEU score of the vanilla VLM. Additionally, we replace the VLM from the
'speaker' with lightweight components: (i) a ViT for image perception and (ii)
a GPT2 language generation, and train them from scratch using LoGIC, obtaining
a $31$ BLEU score in the unsupervised setting, a $10$ points advantage over
existing unsupervised image-captioning methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽视了不平衡协变量偏移这一复杂异构性，FedAKD旨在平衡预测准确性与协作公平性。

Method: FedAKD包含客户端和服务器更新：客户端通过异步知识蒸馏更新模型，服务器利用高置信度样本更新全局模型。

Result: 在多个数据集上，FedAKD显著提高了协作公平性、预测准确性，并促进了客户端参与。

Conclusion: FedAKD为联邦学习中不平衡协变量偏移问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Collaborative fairness is a crucial challenge in federated learning. However,
existing approaches often overlook a practical yet complex form of
heterogeneity: imbalanced covariate shift. We provide a theoretical analysis of
this setting, which motivates the design of FedAKD (Federated Asynchronous
Knowledge Distillation)- simple yet effective approach that balances accurate
prediction with collaborative fairness. FedAKD consists of client and server
updates. In the client update, we introduce a novel asynchronous knowledge
distillation strategy based on our preliminary analysis, which reveals that
while correctly predicted samples exhibit similar feature distributions across
clients, incorrectly predicted samples show significant variability. This
suggests that imbalanced covariate shift primarily arises from misclassified
samples. Leveraging this insight, our approach first applies traditional
knowledge distillation to update client models while keeping the global model
fixed. Next, we select correctly predicted high-confidence samples and update
the global model using these samples while keeping client models fixed. The
server update simply aggregates all client models. We further provide a
theoretical proof of FedAKD's convergence. Experimental results on public
datasets (FashionMNIST and CIFAR10) and a real-world Electronic Health Records
(EHR) dataset demonstrate that FedAKD significantly improves collaborative
fairness, enhances predictive accuracy, and fosters client participation even
under highly heterogeneous data distributions.

TL;DR: WERSA是一种线性时间复杂度的注意力机制，显著降低计算成本，同时保持高性能，适用于长序列处理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统注意力机制在长序列处理中计算复杂度高的问题，提升效率和可扩展性。

Method: 结合内容自适应的随机谱特征、多分辨率Haar小波和可学习参数，实现线性时间复杂度的选择性注意力。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现最佳，显著减少训练时间和计算资源，同时提高准确性。

Conclusion: WERSA为长序列处理提供了高效、低成本的解决方案，推动了可持续AI发展。

Abstract: Transformer models are computationally costly on long sequences since regular
attention has quadratic $O(n^2)$ time complexity. We introduce Wavelet-Enhanced
Random Spectral Attention (WERSA), a novel mechanism of linear $O(n)$ time
complexity that is pivotal to enable successful long-sequence processing
without the performance trade-off. WERSA merges content-adaptive random
spectral features together with multi-resolution Haar wavelets and learnable
parameters to selectively attend to informative scales of data while preserving
linear efficiency.
  Large-scale comparisons \textbf{on single GPU} and across various benchmarks
(vision, NLP, hierarchical reasoning) and various attention mechanisms (like
Multiheaded Attention, Flash-Attention-2, FNet, Linformer, Performer,
Waveformer), reveal uniform advantages of WERSA. It achieves best accuracy in
all tests. On ArXiv classification, WERSA improves accuracy over vanilla
attention by 1.2\% (86.2\% vs 85.0\%) while cutting training time by 81\% (296s
vs 1554s) and FLOPS by 73.4\% (26.2G vs 98.4G). Significantly, WERSA excels
where vanilla and FlashAttention-2 fail: on ArXiv-128k's extremely lengthy
sequences, it achieves best accuracy (79.1\%) and AUC (0.979) among viable
methods, operating on data that gives Out-Of-Memory errors to quadratic methods
while being \textbf{twice as fast} as Waveformer, its next-best competitor.
  By significantly reducing computational loads without compromising accuracy,
WERSA makes possible more practical, more affordable, long-context models, in
particular on low-resource hardware, for more sustainable and more scalable AI
development.

Motivation: 传统理论认为模型容量增加会导致过拟合，但实践中过拟合现象较少见。论文探讨局部过拟合的可能性及其与双下降现象的关系。

Conclusion: 局部过拟合是存在的，且可通过知识融合与蒸馏有效缓解，实现性能提升与复杂度降低的双赢。

Abstract: Overfitting in deep neural networks occurs less frequently than expected.
This is a puzzling observation, as theory predicts that greater model capacity
should eventually lead to overfitting -- yet this is rarely seen in practice.
But what if overfitting does occur, not globally, but in specific sub-regions
of the data space? In this work, we introduce a novel score that measures the
forgetting rate of deep models on validation data, capturing what we term local
overfitting: a performance degradation confined to certain regions of the input
space. We demonstrate that local overfitting can arise even without
conventional overfitting, and is closely linked to the double descent
phenomenon.
  Building on these insights, we introduce a two-stage approach that leverages
the training history of a single model to recover and retain forgotten
knowledge: first, by aggregating checkpoints into an ensemble, and then by
distilling it into a single model of the original size, thus enhancing
performance without added inference cost.
  Extensive experiments across multiple datasets, modern architectures, and
training regimes validate the effectiveness of our approach. Notably, in the
presence of label noise, our method -- Knowledge Fusion followed by Knowledge
Distillation -- outperforms both the original model and independently trained
ensembles, achieving a rare win-win scenario: reduced training and inference
complexity.

Abstract: The domain-consistent adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) remains low in
thermal power plants due to the black-box nature of AI algorithms and low
representation of domain knowledge in conventional data-centric analytics. In
this paper, we develop a MAhalanobis Distance-based OPTimization (MAD-OPT)
framework that incorporates the Mahalanobis distance-based constraint to
introduce domain knowledge into data-centric analytics. The developed MAD-OPT
framework is applied to maximize thermal efficiency and minimize turbine heat
rate for a 395 MW capacity gas turbine system. We demonstrate that the MAD-OPT
framework can estimate domain-informed optimal process conditions under
different ambient conditions, and the optimal solutions are found to be robust
as evaluated by Monte Carlo simulations. We also apply the MAD-OPT framework to
estimate optimal process conditions beyond the design power generation limit of
the gas turbine system, and have found comparable results with the actual data
of the power plant. We demonstrate that implementing data-centric optimization
analytics without incorporating domain-informed constraints may provide
ineffective solutions that may not be implementable in the real operation of
the gas turbine system. This research advances the integration of the
data-driven domain knowledge into machine learning-powered analytics that
enhances the domain-informed operation excellence and paves the way for safe AI

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究PMD中两种正则化技术的相互作用，填补理论丰富但实证不足的空白。

Method: 在小型RL环境中进行超过50万次训练种子的大规模实验。

Result: 两种正则化技术可部分替代，但其精确组合对性能至关重要。

Conclusion: 研究为开发更鲁棒的RL算法提供了方向，尤其是针对超参数敏感性。

Abstract: Policy Mirror Descent (PMD) has emerged as a unifying framework in
reinforcement learning (RL) by linking policy gradient methods with a
first-order optimization method known as mirror descent. At its core, PMD
incorporates two key regularization components: (i) a distance term that
enforces a trust region for stable policy updates and (ii) an MDP regularizer
that augments the reward function to promote structure and robustness. While
PMD has been extensively studied in theory, empirical investigations remain
scarce. This work provides a large-scale empirical analysis of the interplay
between these two regularization techniques, running over 500k training seeds
on small RL environments. Our results demonstrate that, although the two
regularizers can partially substitute each other, their precise combination is
critical for achieving robust performance. These findings highlight the
potential for advancing research on more robust algorithms in RL, particularly
with respect to hyperparameter sensitivity.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合测试时适应（TTA）与风险监控框架的方法，以检测模型性能的最终失效点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 测试时数据偏移是预测模型部署中的常见挑战，TTA虽能暂时解决，但模型最终可能失效。需要一种方法来监控性能并发出警报。

Method: 扩展了基于顺序测试的监控工具，结合置信序列，适应模型在测试时更新且无标签数据的情况。

Result: 提出的TTA监控框架在多种数据集、分布偏移类型和TTA方法中表现有效。

Conclusion: 结合TTA与风险监控框架能有效检测模型性能失效点，为模型维护提供统计支持。

Abstract: Encountering shifted data at test time is a ubiquitous challenge when
deploying predictive models. Test-time adaptation (TTA) methods address this
issue by continuously adapting a deployed model using only unlabeled test data.
While TTA can extend the model's lifespan, it is only a temporary solution.
Eventually the model might degrade to the point that it must be taken offline
and retrained. To detect such points of ultimate failure, we propose pairing
TTA with risk monitoring frameworks that track predictive performance and raise
alerts when predefined performance criteria are violated. Specifically, we
extend existing monitoring tools based on sequential testing with confidence
sequences to accommodate scenarios in which the model is updated at test time
and no test labels are available to estimate the performance metrics of
interest. Our extensions unlock the application of rigorous statistical risk
monitoring to TTA, and we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed TTA
monitoring framework across a representative set of datasets, distribution
shift types, and TTA methods.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新方法，通过跟踪训练最后阶段的参数活动来缓解深度神经网络中的灾难性遗忘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 灾难性遗忘是深度神经网络学习新任务时性能下降的问题，现有正则化方法试图约束重要参数以保留旧知识。

Method: 提出在训练最后阶段跟踪参数活动，认为此时高活动的参数揭示了损失函数中较平坦的方向，适合适应新任务同时保留旧知识。

Result: 实验表明该方法在平衡灾难性遗忘缓解和新任务性能方面表现优越。

Conclusion: 通过关注训练最后阶段的参数活动，能更有效地解决灾难性遗忘问题。

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting in deep neural networks occurs when learning new
tasks degrades performance on previously learned tasks due to knowledge
overwriting. Among the approaches to mitigate this issue, regularization
techniques aim to identify and constrain "important" parameters to preserve
previous knowledge. In the highly nonconvex optimization landscape of deep
learning, we propose a novel perspective: tracking parameters during the final
training plateau is more effective than monitoring them throughout the entire
training process. We argue that parameters that exhibit higher activity
(movement and variability) during this plateau reveal directions in the loss
landscape that are relatively flat, making them suitable for adaptation to new
tasks while preserving knowledge from previous ones. Our comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that this approach achieves superior performance in
balancing catastrophic forgetting mitigation with strong performance on newly
learned tasks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合延迟嵌入线性输入和可学习多层感知机（MLP）的自适应NVAR模型，以提升混沌系统预测的准确性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统NVAR和RC方法依赖固定非线性结构，难以适应高噪声或高维数据，且计算成本高。

Method: 结合延迟嵌入线性输入和可学习MLP生成特征，通过梯度优化联合训练MLP和线性读出层。

Result: 在混沌系统实验中，自适应模型在预测准确性和噪声鲁棒性上优于标准NVAR。

Conclusion: 自适应NVAR模型简化了参数调优，提升了预测性能，适用于高噪声和低观测频率场景。

Abstract: Nonlinear vector autoregression (NVAR) and reservoir computing (RC) have
shown promise in forecasting chaotic dynamical systems, such as the Lorenz-63
model and El Nino-Southern Oscillation. However, their reliance on fixed
nonlinearities - polynomial expansions in NVAR or random feature maps in RC -
limits their adaptability to high noise or real-world data. These methods also
scale poorly in high-dimensional settings due to costly matrix inversion during
readout computation. We propose an adaptive NVAR model that combines
delay-embedded linear inputs with features generated by a shallow, learnable
multi-layer perceptron (MLP). The MLP and linear readout are jointly trained
using gradient-based optimization, enabling the model to learn data-driven
nonlinearities while preserving a simple readout structure. Unlike standard
NVAR, our approach avoids the need for an exhaustive and sensitive grid search
over ridge and delay parameters. Instead, tuning is restricted to neural
network hyperparameters, improving scalability. Initial experiments on chaotic
systems tested under noise-free and synthetically noisy conditions showed that
the adaptive model outperformed the standard NVAR in predictive accuracy and
showed robust forecasting under noisy conditions with a lower observation
frequency.

Motivation: 解决经典傅里叶神经算子在科学机器学习中的局限性，通过量子-经典混合计算提高性能和稳定性。

Method: 将傅里叶算子计算分区到经典和量子资源，采用消息传递框架，使用单热编码将数据编码为量子态，并通过变分方案优化量子电路参数。

Result: 在Burgers方程和Navier-Stokes方程上，PHQFNO达到或超过经典FNO的准确性，尤其在不可压缩Navier-Stokes方程中表现更优。

Conclusion: PHQFNO展示了量子-经典混合方法在科学机器学习中的潜力，具有更高的准确性和对输入噪声的稳定性。

Abstract: We introduce the Partitioned Hybrid Quantum Fourier Neural Operator (PHQFNO),
a generalization of the Quantum Fourier Neural Operator (QFNO) for scientific
machine learning. PHQFNO partitions the Fourier operator computation across
classical and quantum resources, enabling tunable quantum-classical
hybridization and distributed execution across quantum and classical devices.
The method extends QFNOs to higher dimensions and incorporates a
message-passing framework to distribute data across different partitions. Input
data are encoded into quantum states using unary encoding, and quantum circuit
parameters are optimized using a variational scheme. We implement PHQFNO using
PennyLane with PyTorch integration and evaluate it on Burgers' equation,
incompressible and compressible Navier-Stokes equations. We show that PHQFNO
recovers classical FNO accuracy. On incompressible Navier-Stokes, PHQFNO
achieves higher accuracy than its classical counterparts. Finally, we perform a
sensitivity analysis under input noise, confirming improved stability of PHQFNO
over classical baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对非线性部分观测系统（常见于工程和地球科学应用），通过Koopman嵌入发现潜在状态表示，使其动态条件线性化，从而简化数据同化过程。

Method: 利用Koopman嵌入将未观测系统状态映射为潜在状态，建立条件高斯系统，通过解析公式高效计算潜在状态的后验分布。

Result: 在多个非线性PDEs问题（如Burgers方程、Kuramoto-Sivashinsky方程和2-D Navier-Stokes方程）中，CGKN在状态预测和数据同化方面表现优异，与最先进的SciML方法相当。

Conclusion: CGKN框架统一了科学机器学习（SciML）与数据同化，并为其他外环应用（如设计优化、反问题和最优控制）提供了示例。

Abstract: A discrete-time conditional Gaussian Koopman network (CGKN) is developed in
this work to learn surrogate models that can perform efficient state forecast
and data assimilation (DA) for high-dimensional complex dynamical systems,
e.g., systems governed by nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs).
Focusing on nonlinear partially observed systems that are common in many
engineering and earth science applications, this work exploits Koopman
embedding to discover a proper latent representation of the unobserved system
states, such that the dynamics of the latent states are conditional linear,
i.e., linear with the given observed system states. The modeled system of the
observed and latent states then becomes a conditional Gaussian system, for
which the posterior distribution of the latent states is Gaussian and can be
efficiently evaluated via analytical formulae. The analytical formulae of DA
facilitate the incorporation of DA performance into the learning process of the
modeled system, which leads to a framework that unifies scientific machine
learning (SciML) and data assimilation. The performance of discrete-time CGKN
is demonstrated on several canonical problems governed by nonlinear PDEs with
intermittency and turbulent features, including the viscous Burgers' equation,
the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, and the 2-D Navier-Stokes equations, with
which we show that the discrete-time CGKN framework achieves comparable
performance as the state-of-the-art SciML methods in state forecast and
provides efficient and accurate DA results. The discrete-time CGKN framework
also serves as an example to illustrate unifying the development of SciML
models and their other outer-loop applications such as design optimization,
inverse problems, and optimal control.

Motivation: 符号加速器在基因组学、NLP和网络安全等领域广泛应用，但面临内存使用和路由复杂性的可扩展性问题。

Method: AutoSlim使用随机森林分类，基于边缘分数和结构特征修剪低影响力转换，支持加权转换的自动化简化。

Result: 在NAPOLY+上评估，AutoSlim实现了FPGA LUT减少40%，转换修剪超过30%，并能扩展到比现有基准大一个数量级的图。

Conclusion: AutoSlim通过修剪有效缓解硬件资源膨胀，硬件互连（扇出）对硬件成本有重要影响。

Abstract: Symbolic accelerators are increasingly used for symbolic data processing in
domains such as genomics, NLP, and cybersecurity. However, these accelerators
face scalability issues due to excessive memory use and routing complexity,
especially when targeting a large set. We present AutoSlim, a machine
learning-based graph simplification framework designed to reduce the complexity
of symbolic accelerators built on Non-deterministic Finite Automata (NFA)
deployed on FPGA-based overlays such as NAPOLY+. AutoSlim uses Random Forest
classification to prune low-impact transitions based on edge scores and
structural features, significantly reducing automata graph density while
preserving semantic correctness. Unlike prior tools, AutoSlim targets automated
score-aware simplification with weighted transitions, enabling efficient
ranking-based sequence analysis. We evaluated data sets (1K to 64K nodes) in
NAPOLY+ and conducted performance measurements including latency, throughput,
and resource usage. AutoSlim achieves up to 40 percent reduction in FPGA LUTs
and over 30 percent pruning in transitions, while scaling to graphs an order of
magnitude larger than existing benchmarks. Our results also demonstrate how
hardware interconnection (fanout) heavily influences hardware cost and that
AutoSlim's pruning mitigates resource blowup.

Motivation: 离线强化学习中Q值外推误差是主要问题，需要一种方法减少外推时的误差。

Method: 提出奖励缩放与层归一化（RS-LN）和不可行动作惩罚（PA），结合为PARS算法。

Result: 在D4RL基准测试中表现优异，尤其在AntMaze Ultra任务中成功。

Conclusion: PARS算法有效解决了Q值外推问题，提升了离线强化学习的性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with offline data suffers from Q-value extrapolation
errors. To address this issue, we first demonstrate that linear extrapolation
of the Q-function beyond the data range is particularly problematic. To
mitigate this, we propose guiding the gradual decrease of Q-values outside the
data range, which is achieved through reward scaling with layer normalization
(RS-LN) and a penalization mechanism for infeasible actions (PA). By combining
RS-LN and PA, we develop a new algorithm called PARS. We evaluate PARS across a
range of tasks, demonstrating superior performance compared to state-of-the-art
algorithms in both offline training and online fine-tuning on the D4RL
benchmark, with notable success in the challenging AntMaze Ultra task.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的MoE架构BlockFFN，通过改进路由设计和训练目标，提升了token级和chunk级稀疏性，实现了更高效的加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MoE架构的路由不可微分且不灵活，且稀疏模式不利于低资源条件下的加速，因此需要一种更高效的架构。

Method: 使用ReLU激活和RMSNorm的路由器，设计CLS感知的训练目标，并实现高效的加速内核。

Result: BlockFFN在token级稀疏性（TLS）和chunk级稀疏性（CLS）上表现优异，分别达到80%和70%，加速内核在终端设备上实现了3.67倍的加速。

Conclusion: BlockFFN是一种高效且加速友好的MoE架构，适用于低资源环境。

Abstract: To alleviate the computational burden of large language models (LLMs),
architectures with activation sparsity, represented by mixture-of-experts
(MoE), have attracted increasing attention. However, the non-differentiable and
inflexible routing of vanilla MoE hurts model performance. Moreover, while each
token activates only a few parameters, these sparsely-activated architectures
exhibit low chunk-level sparsity, indicating that the union of multiple
consecutive tokens activates a large ratio of parameters. Such a sparsity
pattern is unfriendly for acceleration under low-resource conditions (e.g.,
end-side devices) and incompatible with mainstream acceleration techniques
(e.g., speculative decoding). To address these challenges, we introduce a novel
MoE architecture, BlockFFN, as well as its efficient training and deployment
techniques. Specifically, we use a router integrating ReLU activation and
RMSNorm for differentiable and flexible routing. Next, to promote both
token-level sparsity (TLS) and chunk-level sparsity (CLS), CLS-aware training
objectives are designed, making BlockFFN more acceleration-friendly. Finally,
we implement efficient acceleration kernels, combining activation sparsity and
speculative decoding for the first time. The experimental results demonstrate
the superior performance of BlockFFN over other MoE baselines, achieving over
80% TLS and 70% 8-token CLS. Our kernels achieve up to 3.67$\times$ speedup on
real end-side devices than dense models. All codes and checkpoints are
available publicly (https://github.com/thunlp/BlockFFN).

Motivation: 分布式优化中通信开销是主要瓶颈，现有低秩梯度压缩方法要么方差高（随机方法），要么缺乏收敛保证（贪婪方法）。

Method: GreedyLore结合误差反馈校正贪婪压缩的偏差，并引入半懒惰子空间更新确保压缩操作始终收缩。

Conclusion: GreedyLore填补了贪婪压缩方法缺乏收敛保证的空白，同时保持了优异的性能。

Abstract: Distributed optimization is pivotal for large-scale signal processing and
machine learning, yet communication overhead remains a major bottleneck.
Low-rank gradient compression, in which the transmitted gradients are
approximated by low-rank matrices to reduce communication, offers a promising
remedy. Existing methods typically adopt either randomized or greedy
compression strategies: randomized approaches project gradients onto randomly
chosen subspaces, introducing high variance and degrading empirical
performance; greedy methods select the most informative subspaces, achieving
strong empirical results but lacking convergence guarantees. To address this
gap, we propose GreedyLore--the first Greedy Low-Rank gradient compression
algorithm for distributed learning with rigorous convergence guarantees.
GreedyLore incorporates error feedback to correct the bias introduced by greedy
compression and introduces a semi-lazy subspace update that ensures the
compression operator remains contractive throughout all iterations. With these
techniques, we prove that GreedyLore achieves a convergence rate of
$\mathcal{O}(\sigma/\sqrt{NT} + 1/T)$ under standard optimizers such as MSGD
and Adam--marking the first linear speedup convergence rate for low-rank
gradient compression. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate our
theoretical findings.

Motivation: 风险规避强化学习（RaCRL）容易因保守探索导致策略次优化，无法最大化奖励或达成目标。

Method: 提出ORAC方法，通过最大化奖励值函数的局部上界和最小化风险规避成本值函数的局部下界，动态调整成本权重以鼓励探索。

Result: 实验证明ORAC在Safety-Gymnasium和CityLearn等任务中显著改善了奖励-成本权衡，避免了次优策略。

Conclusion: ORAC通过乐观探索有效解决了RaCRL的保守性问题，提升了策略性能。

Abstract: Risk-averse Constrained Reinforcement Learning (RaCRL) aims to learn policies
that minimise the likelihood of rare and catastrophic constraint violations
caused by an environment's inherent randomness. In general, risk-aversion leads
to conservative exploration of the environment which typically results in
converging to sub-optimal policies that fail to adequately maximise reward or,
in some cases, fail to achieve the goal. In this paper, we propose an
exploration-based approach for RaCRL called Optimistic Risk-averse Actor Critic
(ORAC), which constructs an exploratory policy by maximising a local upper
confidence bound of the state-action reward value function whilst minimising a
local lower confidence bound of the risk-averse state-action cost value
function. Specifically, at each step, the weighting assigned to the cost value
is increased or decreased if it exceeds or falls below the safety constraint
value. This way the policy is encouraged to explore uncertain regions of the
environment to discover high reward states whilst still satisfying the safety
constraints. Our experimental results demonstrate that the ORAC approach
prevents convergence to sub-optimal policies and improves significantly the
reward-cost trade-off in various continuous control tasks such as
Safety-Gymnasium and a complex building energy management environment
CityLearn.

Abstract: Generative reward models (also known as LLMs-as-judges), which use large
language models (LLMs) to evaluate answer quality, are increasingly adopted in
reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR). They are often preferred
over rigid rule-based metrics, especially for complex reasoning tasks involving
free-form outputs. In this paradigm, an LLM is typically prompted to compare a
candidate answer against a ground-truth reference and assign a binary reward
indicating correctness. Despite the seeming simplicity of this comparison task,
we find that generative reward models exhibit surprising vulnerabilities to
superficial manipulations: non-word symbols (e.g., ":" or ".") or reasoning
openers like "Thought process:" and "Let's solve this problem step by step."
can often lead to false positive rewards. We demonstrate that this weakness is
widespread across LLMs, datasets, and prompt formats, posing a serious threat
for core algorithmic paradigms that rely on generative reward models, such as
rejection sampling, preference optimization, and RLVR. To mitigate this issue,
we introduce a simple yet effective data augmentation strategy and train a new
generative reward model with substantially improved robustness. Our findings
highlight the urgent need for more reliable LLM-based evaluation methods. We
release our robust, general-domain reward model and its synthetic training data

Conclusion: 结论是因果抽象不足以支持机制可解释性，需结合信息编码假设才能有意义。

Abstract: The concept of causal abstraction got recently popularised to demystify the
opaque decision-making processes of machine learning models; in short, a neural
network can be abstracted as a higher-level algorithm if there exists a
function which allows us to map between them. Notably, most interpretability
papers implement these maps as linear functions, motivated by the linear
representation hypothesis: the idea that features are encoded linearly in a
model's representations. However, this linearity constraint is not required by
the definition of causal abstraction. In this work, we critically examine the
concept of causal abstraction by considering arbitrarily powerful alignment
maps. In particular, we prove that under reasonable assumptions, any neural
network can be mapped to any algorithm, rendering this unrestricted notion of
causal abstraction trivial and uninformative. We complement these theoretical
findings with empirical evidence, demonstrating that it is possible to
perfectly map models to algorithms even when these models are incapable of
solving the actual task; e.g., on an experiment using randomly initialised
language models, our alignment maps reach 100% interchange-intervention
accuracy on the indirect object identification task. This raises the non-linear
representation dilemma: if we lift the linearity constraint imposed to
alignment maps in causal abstraction analyses, we are left with no principled
way to balance the inherent trade-off between these maps' complexity and
accuracy. Together, these results suggest an answer to our title's question:
causal abstraction is not enough for mechanistic interpretability, as it
becomes vacuous without assumptions about how models encode information.
Studying the connection between this information-encoding assumption and causal
abstraction should lead to exciting future work.
