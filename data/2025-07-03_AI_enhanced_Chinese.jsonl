This\nlimitation becomes particularly apparent in complex terrains. Obstacle\nnegotiation, a critical scenario exemplifying such challenges, requires both\nreal-time perception of obstacle geometry and responsiveness to user intention\nabout when and where to step over or onto, to dynamically adjust swing\ntrajectories. We propose a novel control strategy that fuses environmental\nawareness and human cooperativeness: an on-board depth camera detects obstacles\nahead of swing phase, prompting an elevated early-swing trajectory to ensure\nclearance, while late-swing control defers to natural biomechanical cues from\nthe user. This approach enables intuitive stepping strategies without requiring\nunnatural movement patterns. Experiments with three non-amputee participants\ndemonstrated 100 percent success across more than 150 step-overs and 30\nstep-ons with randomly placed obstacles of varying heights (4-16 cm) and\ndistances (15-70 cm).

While effective, these\nmethods require substantial computational resources and extensive synthetic\ndata, thereby relaxing the original ZSL assumptions. In this paper, we propose\nFSIGenZ, a few-shot-inspired generative ZSL framework that reduces reliance on\nlarge-scale feature synthesis. Our key insight is that class-level attributes\nexhibit instance-level variability, i.e., some attributes may be absent or\npartially visible, yet conventional ZSL methods treat them as uniformly\npresent. To address this, we introduce Model-Specific Attribute Scoring (MSAS),\nwhich dynamically re-scores class attributes based on model-specific\noptimization to approximate instance-level variability without access to unseen\ndata.

Differently,\nPDCs are incorporated in a CNN architecture so that the valuable contrast cues\nare extracted from rich feature maps. For efficiency, we introduce a difference\nconvolution reparameterization (DCR) strategy that embeds PDCs into standard\nconvolutions, eliminating computation and parameters at inference.\nAdditionally, we introduce SpatioTemporal Difference Convolution (STDC) for\nvideo SOD, enhancing the standard 3D convolution with spatiotemporal contrast\ncapture.

However, directly training policies to\nsimultaneously handle dual extreme challenges, i.e., extreme underactuation and\nextreme terrains, as in monopedal hopping tasks, remains highly challenging due\nto unstable early-stage interactions and unreliable reward feedback. To address\nthis, we propose JumpER (jump-start reinforcement learning via self-evolving\npriors), an RL training framework that structures policy learning into multiple\nstages of increasing complexity. By dynamically generating self-evolving priors\nthrough iterative bootstrapping of previously learned policies, JumpER\nprogressively refines and enhances guidance, thereby stabilizing exploration\nand policy optimization without relying on external expert priors or\nhandcrafted reward shaping. Specifically, when integrated with a structured\nthree-stage curriculum that incrementally evolves action modality, observation\nspace, and task objective, JumpER enables quadruped robots to achieve robust\nmonopedal hopping on unpredictable terrains for the first time. Remarkably, the\nresulting policy effectively handles challenging scenarios that traditional\nmethods struggle to conquer, including wide gaps up to 60 cm, irregularly\nspaced stairs, and stepping stones with distances varying from 15 cm to 35 cm.\nJumpER thus provides a principled and scalable approach for addressing\nlocomotion tasks under the dual challenges of extreme underactuation and\nextreme terrains.", "AI": {"tldr": "JumpER\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u8fdb\u5316\u5148\u9a8c\u5206\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u56db\u8db3\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u6781\u7aef\u6b20\u9a71\u52a8\u548c\u6781\u7aef\u5730\u5f62\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u5355\u8db3\u8df3\u8dc3\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6781\u7aef\u6b20\u9a71\u52a8\u548c\u6781\u7aef\u5730\u5f62\u4e0b\u8bad\u7ec3\u5355\u8db3\u8df3\u8dc3\u7b56\u7565\u65f6\u7684\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u5956\u52b1\u53cd\u9988\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faJumpER\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u9636\u6bb5\u52a8\u6001\u751f\u6210\u81ea\u8fdb\u5316\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u9010\u6b65\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "\u56db\u8db3\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u9996\u6b21\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5065\u5355\u8db3\u8df3\u8dc3\uff0c\u80fd\u5e94\u5bf960\u5398\u7c73\u5bbd\u95f4\u9699\u3001\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\u697c\u68af\u548c15-35\u5398\u7c73\u95f4\u8ddd\u7684\u8e0f\u811a\u77f3\u3002", "conclusion": "JumpER\u4e3a\u6781\u7aef\u6b20\u9a71\u52a8\u548c\u6781\u7aef\u5730\u5f62\u4e0b\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

To address these issues, we\npropose an uncertainty-aware, multi-view dynamic decision framework for omics\ndata classification that aims to achieve high diagnostic accuracy while\nminimizing testing costs. Methodology: At the single-omics level, we refine the\nactivation functions of neural networks to generate Dirichlet distribution\nparameters, utilizing subjective logic to quantify both the belief masses and\nuncertainty mass of classification results. Belief mass reflects the support of\na specific omics modality for a disease class, while the uncertainty parameter\ncaptures limitations in data quality and model discriminability, providing a\nmore trustworthy basis for decision-making. At the multi omics level, we employ\na fusion strategy based on Dempster-Shafer theory to integrate heterogeneous\nmodalities, leveraging their complementarity to boost diagnostic accuracy and\nrobustness. A dynamic decision mechanism is then applied that omics data are\nincrementally introduced for each patient until either all data sources are\nutilized or the model confidence exceeds a predefined threshold, potentially\nbefore all data sources are utilized.

Recent advances in weed mapping leverage ground-vehicle\nRed Green Blue (RGB) cameras, satellite and drone-based remote sensing combined\nwith sensors such as spectral, Near Infra-Red (NIR), and thermal cameras. The\nresulting data are processed using advanced techniques including big data\nanalytics and machine learning, significantly improving the spatial and\ntemporal resolution of weed maps and enabling site-specific management\ndecisions. Despite a growing body of research in this domain, there is a lack\nof comprehensive literature reviews specifically focused on weed mapping. In\nparticular, the absence of a structured analysis spanning the entire mapping\npipeline, from data acquisition to processing techniques and mapping tools,\nlimits progress in the field. This review addresses these gaps by\nsystematically examining state-of-the-art methods in data acquisition (sensor\nand platform technologies), data processing (including annotation and\nmodelling), and mapping techniques (such as spatiotemporal analysis and\ndecision support tools).

This approach leverages a pre-trained diffusion model,\nStable Diffusion XL, to overcome the generalization failures of existing\nmethods that rely on limited HDR panorama datasets. While conceptually simple,\nthe task remains challenging because diffusion models often insert incorrect or\ninconsistent content and cannot readily generate chrome balls in HDR format.\nOur analysis reveals that the inpainting process is highly sensitive to the\ninitial noise in the diffusion process, occasionally resulting in unrealistic\noutputs. To address this, we first introduce DiffusionLight, which uses\niterative inpainting to compute a median chrome ball from multiple outputs to\nserve as a stable, low-frequency lighting prior that guides the generation of a\nhigh-quality final result. To generate high-dynamic-range (HDR) light probes,\nan Exposure LoRA is fine-tuned to create LDR images at multiple exposure\nvalues, which are then merged. While effective, DiffusionLight is\ntime-intensive, requiring approximately 30 minutes per estimation. To reduce\nthis overhead, we introduce DiffusionLight-Turbo, which reduces the runtime to\nabout 30 seconds with minimal quality loss. This 60x speedup is achieved by\ntraining a Turbo LoRA to directly predict the averaged chrome balls from the\niterative process.

Among these, the auto white balance (AWB) module is\nessential for compensating for scene illumination. However, commercial AWB\nsystems often strive to compute aesthetic white-balance preferences rather than\naccurate neutral color correction. While learning-based methods have improved\nAWB accuracy, they typically struggle to generalize across different camera\nsensors -- an issue for smartphones with multiple cameras. Recent work has\nexplored cross-camera AWB, but most methods remain focused on achieving neutral\nwhite balance. In contrast, this paper is the first to address aesthetic\nconsistency by learning a post-illuminant-estimation mapping that transforms\nneutral illuminant corrections into aesthetically preferred corrections in a\ncamera-agnostic space. Once trained, our mapping can be applied after any\nneutral AWB module to enable consistent and stylized color rendering across\nunseen cameras. Our proposed model is lightweight -- containing only $\\sim$500\nparameters -- and runs in just 0.024 milliseconds on a typical flagship mobile\nCPU.

Conventional deep learning approaches for analyzing\nthese signals typically rely on homogeneous datasets and static bespoke models,\nlimiting their robustness and generalizability across diverse clinical settings\nand acquisition protocols. In this study, we present a cardiac sensing\nfoundation model (CSFM) that leverages advanced transformer architectures and a\ngenerative, masked pretraining strategy to learn unified representations from\nvast, heterogeneous health records. Our model is pretrained on an innovative\nmulti-modal integration of data from multiple large-scale datasets (including\nMIMIC-III-WDB, MIMIC-IV-ECG, and CODE), comprising cardiac signals and the\ncorresponding clinical or machine-generated text reports from approximately 1.7\nmillion individuals. We demonstrate that the embeddings derived from our CSFM\nnot only serve as effective feature extractors across diverse cardiac sensing\nscenarios, but also enable seamless transfer learning across varying input\nconfigurations and sensor modalities. Extensive evaluations across diagnostic\ntasks, demographic information recognition, vital sign measurement, clinical\noutcome prediction, and ECG question answering reveal that CSFM consistently\noutperforms traditional one-modal-one-task approaches. Notably, CSFM exhibits\nrobust performance across multiple ECG lead configurations from standard\n12-lead systems to single-lead setups, and in scenarios where only ECG, only\nPPG, or a combination thereof is available. These findings highlight the\npotential of CSFM as a versatile and scalable solution, for comprehensive\ncardiac monitoring.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5fc3\u810f\u611f\u77e5\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff08CSFM\uff09\uff0c\u5229\u7528Transformer\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u63a9\u7801\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4ece\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5f02\u6784\u5065\u5eb7\u8bb0\u5f55\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u7edf\u4e00\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5fc3\u810f\u4fe1\u53f7\u5206\u6790\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u540c\u8d28\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u9759\u6001\u5b9a\u5236\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316\u4e34\u5e8a\u73af\u5883\u548c\u91c7\u96c6\u534f\u8bae\u4e2d\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528Transformer\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u63a9\u7801\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\uff08\u5305\u62ecMIMIC-III-WDB\u3001MIMIC-IV-ECG\u548cCODE\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff09\uff0c\u8986\u76d6\u7ea6170\u4e07\u4e2a\u4f53\u7684\u5fc3\u810f\u4fe1\u53f7\u53ca\u4e34\u5e8a\u6216\u673a\u5668\u751f\u6210\u6587\u672c\u62a5\u544a\u3002", "result": "CSFM\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u8868\u5f81\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316\u5fc3\u810f\u611f\u77e5\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u8de8\u8f93\u5165\u914d\u7f6e\u548c\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u65e0\u7f1d\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5728\u8bca\u65ad\u4efb\u52a1\u3001\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u4fe1\u606f\u8bc6\u522b\u3001\u751f\u547d\u4f53\u5f81\u6d4b\u91cf\u3001\u4e34\u5e8a\u7ed3\u679c\u9884\u6d4b\u548cECG\u95ee\u7b54\u4e2d\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u5355\u4efb\u52a1\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "CSFM\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u529f\u80fd\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u4e86\u5168\u9762\u5fc3\u810f\u76d1\u6d4b\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Camouflage-based physical attack is a more promising\napproach compared to the patch-based attack, offering stronger adversarial\neffectiveness in complex physical environments. However, most prior work relies\non mesh priors of the target object and virtual environments constructed by\nsimulators, which are time-consuming to obtain and inevitably differ from the\nreal world.

Toward\nthis end, we propose PreferenceHack, a novel few-shot setting benchmark, the\nfirst to test reward models on reward hacking in a paired preference format.\nFinally, we show that Activation RM achieves state-of-the-art performance on\nthis benchmark, surpassing even GPT-4o.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5956\u52b1\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\u2014\u2014\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\uff08Activation RMs\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5bfc\u5411\u6784\u5efa\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "motivation": "\u5bf9\u9f50\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u548c\u5927\u578b\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\uff08LMMs\uff09\u5230\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u662f\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u5173\u952e\uff0c\u4f46\u4f20\u7edf\u5956\u52b1\u5efa\u6a21\u96be\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u65b0\u504f\u597d\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5bfc\u5411\u6784\u5efa\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\uff08Activation RMs\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165PreferenceHack\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6297\u5956\u52b1\u653b\u51fb\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "Activation RMs\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u5956\u52b1\u5efa\u6a21\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5728PreferenceHack\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8aGPT-4o\u3002", "conclusion": "Activation RMs\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5956\u52b1\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

Although\nAI has demonstrated significant potential in medical diagnosis, its application\nto prenatal abdominal anomalies remains limited. Most existing studies focus on\nimage-level classification and rely on standard plane localization, placing\nless emphasis on case-level diagnosis. In this paper, we develop a case-level\nmultiple instance learning (MIL)-based method, free of standard plane\nlocalization, for classifying fetal abdominal anomalies in prenatal ultrasound.\nOur contribution is three-fold. First, we adopt a mixture-of-attention-experts\nmodule (MoAE) to weight different attention heads for various planes. Secondly,\nwe propose a medical-knowledge-driven feature selection module (MFS) to align\nimage features with medical knowledge, performing self-supervised image token\nselection at the case-level.

To address this limitation, we\npropose TypeTele, a type-guided dexterous teleoperation system, which enables\ndexterous hands to perform actions that are not constrained by human motion\npatterns. This is achieved by introducing dexterous manipulation types into the\nteleoperation system, allowing operators to employ appropriate types to\ncomplete specific tasks. To support this system, we build an extensible\ndexterous manipulation type library to cover comprehensive dexterous postures\nused in manipulation tasks.

First, since the motion of the mobile base\ndirectly influences the manipulator's actions, we introduce a mobility-to-body\nconditioning mechanism that guides the model to first extract base motion\nrepresentations, which are then used as context prior for predicting whole-body\nactions. This enables whole-body control that accounts for the potential impact\nof the mobile base's motion. Second, to meet the perception requirements at\ndifferent stages of mobile manipulation, we design a perception-aware\nmultimodal conditioning strategy that dynamically adjusts the fusion weights\nbetween various 2D visual images and 3D point clouds, yielding visual features\ntailored to the current perceptual needs. This allows the model to, for\nexample, adaptively rely more on 2D inputs when semantic information is crucial\nfor action prediction, while placing greater emphasis on 3D geometric\ninformation when precise spatial understanding is required. We validate AC-DiT\nthrough extensive experiments on both simulated and real-world mobile\nmanipulation tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faAC-DiT\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u534f\u8c03\u79fb\u52a8\u5e95\u5ea7\u548c\u673a\u68b0\u81c2\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u5e76\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c03\u6574\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u611f\u77e5\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u8bed\u8a00\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u63a7\u5236\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u534f\u8c03\u79fb\u52a8\u5e95\u5ea7\u548c\u673a\u68b0\u81c2\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u672a\u80fd\u660e\u786e\u5efa\u6a21\u5e95\u5ea7\u5bf9\u673a\u68b0\u81c2\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4e14\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e0d\u540c\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u611f\u77e5\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u79fb\u52a8\u5e95\u5ea7\u5230\u673a\u68b0\u81c2\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u673a\u5236\u548c\u611f\u77e5\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6761\u4ef6\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u65742D\u548c3D\u89c6\u89c9\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u878d\u5408\u6743\u91cd\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u79fb\u52a8\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86AC-DiT\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "AC-DiT\u901a\u8fc7\u534f\u8c03\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u611f\u77e5\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u79fb\u52a8\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

In this study, we propose a novel\nrobust watermarking framework based on diffusion model, called DiffMark.

Existing pixel-wise methods typically assign anomaly\nscores individually and employ a global thresholding strategy to segment\nanomalies. Despite their effectiveness, these approaches encounter significant\nchallenges in real-world applications: (1) neglecting spatial correlations\namong pixels within the same object, resulting in fragmented segmentation; (2)\nvariabil ity in anomaly score distributions across image regions, causing\nglobal thresholds to either generate false positives in background areas or\nmiss segments of anomalous objects. In this work, we introduce OoDDINO, a novel\nmulti-level anomaly segmentation framework designed to address these\nlimitations through a coarse-to-fine anomaly detection strategy. OoDDINO\ncombines an uncertainty-guided anomaly detection model with a pixel-level\nsegmentation model within a two-stage cascade architecture. Initially, we\npropose an Orthogonal Uncertainty-Aware Fusion Strategy (OUAFS) that\nsequentially integrates multiple uncertainty metrics with visual\nrepresentations, employing orthogonal constraints to strengthen the detection\nmodel's capacity for localizing anomalous regions accurately. Subsequently, we\ndevelop an Adaptive Dual-Threshold Network (ADT-Net), which dynamically\ngenerates region-specific thresholds based on object-level detection outputs\nand pixel-wise anomaly scores. This approach allows for distinct thresholding\nstrategies within foreground and background areas, achieving fine-grained\nanomaly segmentation.

Furthermore, the average confidence of the proposals' bounding box and\nmask is used as an additional weighting factor for the object matching score.\nWe empirically show that NOCTIS, without further training/fine tuning,\noutperforms the best RGB and RGB-D methods on the seven core datasets of the\nBOP 2023 challenge for the \"Model-based 2D segmentation of unseen objects\"\ntask.", "AI": {"tldr": "NOCTIS\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u5373\u53ef\u5904\u7406\u591a\u79cd\u65b0\u7269\u4f53\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5206\u5272\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408Grounded-SAM 2\u548cDINOv2\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u8fdb\u5339\u914d\u5206\u6570\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5f15\u5165\u5faa\u73af\u9608\u503c\uff0c\u5728BOP 2023\u6311\u6218\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u5373\u53ef\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u591a\u79cd\u65b0\u7269\u4f53\u7684\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5206\u5272\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982CNOS\u3001SAM-6D\u548cNIDS-Net\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528Grounded-SAM 2\u751f\u6210\u7269\u4f53\u63d0\u8bae\u548c\u5206\u5272\u63a9\u7801\uff0cDINOv2\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u5d4c\u5165\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u5faa\u73af\u9608\u503c\u8fc7\u6ee4\u8865\u4e01\u5e76\u8ba1\u7b97\u5339\u914d\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8fb9\u754c\u6846\u548c\u63a9\u7801\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u52a0\u6743\u3002", "result": "\u5728BOP 2023\u6311\u6218\u7684\u4e03\u5927\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cNOCTIS\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u7269\u4f532D\u5206\u5272\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709RGB\u548cRGB-D\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "NOCTIS\u901a\u8fc7\u7b80\u5355\u4f46\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u65b0\u7269\u4f53\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5206\u5272\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002"}}

(2025) of the \"perfect\" Platonic Representation Hypothesis (PRH) for the\nembedded deep linear network model (EDLN). We show that if trained with SGD,\ntwo EDLNs with different widths and depths and trained on different data will\nbecome Perfectly Platonic, meaning that every possible pair of layers will\nlearn the same representation up to a rotation. Because most of the global\nminima of the loss function are not Platonic, that SGD only finds the perfectly\nPlatonic solution is rather extraordinary. The proof also suggests at least six\nways the PRH can be broken. We also show that in the EDLN model, the emergence\nof the Platonic representations is due to the same reason as the emergence of\nprogressive sharpening.

Meanwhile,\nmany existing missions operate in manual tasking regimes only, thus missing\npotential events of interest. To overcome slow downlink rates cost-effectively,\nonboard detection is a viable solution. However, traditional methane\nenhancement methods are too computationally demanding for resource-limited\nonboard hardware. This work accelerates methane detection by focusing on\nefficient, low-power algorithms. We test fast target detection methods (ACE,\nCEM) that have not been previously used for methane detection and propose a\nMag1c-SAS - a significantly faster variant of the current state-of-the-art\nalgorithm for methane detection: Mag1c. To explore their true detection\npotential, we integrate them with a machine learning model (U-Net, LinkNet).\nOur results identify two promising candidates (Mag1c-SAS and CEM), both\nacceptably accurate for the detection of strong plumes and computationally\nefficient enough for onboard deployment: one optimized more for accuracy, the\nother more for speed, achieving up to ~100x and ~230x faster computation than\noriginal Mag1c on resource-limited hardware. Additionally, we propose and\nevaluate three band selection strategies. One of them can outperform the method\ntraditionally used in the field while using fewer channels, leading to even\nfaster processing without compromising accuracy.

In\nthis paper, we explore strategies to enhance the robustness of multi-modal\nfusion methods for HD map construction while maintaining high accuracy.

In this paper, we comprehensively evaluate current\nLarge Brainwave Foundation Models (LBMs) through systematic fine-tuning\nexperiments across multiple Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) benchmark tasks,\nincluding memory tasks and sleep stage classification. Our extensive analysis\nshows that state-of-the-art LBMs achieve only marginal improvements (0.9%-1.2%)\nover traditional deep architectures while requiring significantly more\nparameters (millions vs thousands), raising important questions about their\nefficiency and applicability in BCI contexts. Moreover, through detailed\nablation studies and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), we significantly reduce\ntrainable parameters without performance degradation, while demonstrating that\narchitectural and training inefficiencies limit LBMs' current capabilities.

To further accelerate FT convergence and\nimprove computing efficiency, PAE MobiLLM integrates activation caching on the\nserver side, which allows the server to reuse historical activations and saves\nthe mobile device from repeatedly computing forward passes for the recurring\ndata samples. Besides, to reduce communication cost, PAE MobiLLM develops a\none-token (i.e., ``pivot'' token) activation shortcut that transmits only a\nsingle activation dimension instead of full activation matrices to guide the\nside network tuning.

We pretrain transformer models on sample traces from this\ntoy, specifically symbolically-labeled interleaved state observations from\nrandomly drawn linear deterministic dynamical systems. We study if the\ntransformer models can recall the state of a sequence previously seen in its\ncontext when prompted to do so with the corresponding in-context label. Taking\na closer look at this task, it becomes clear that the model must perform two\nfunctions: (1) identify which system's state should be recalled and apply that\nsystem to its last seen state, and (2) continuing to apply the correct system\nto predict the subsequent states. Training dynamics reveal that the first\ncapability emerges well into a model's training. Surprisingly, the second\ncapability, of continuing the prediction of a resumed sequence, develops much\nearlier.\n  Via out-of-distribution experiments, and a mechanistic analysis on model\nweights via edge pruning, we find that next-token prediction for this toy\nproblem involves at least two separate mechanisms. One mechanism uses the\ndiscrete symbolic labels to do the associative recall required to predict the\nstart of a resumption of a previously seen sequence. The second mechanism,\nwhich is largely agnostic to the discrete symbolic labels, performs a\n\"Bayesian-style\" prediction based on the previous token and the context. These\ntwo mechanisms have different learning dynamics.\n  To confirm that this multi-mechanism (manifesting as separate phase\ntransitions) phenomenon is not just an artifact of our toy setting, we used\nOLMo training checkpoints on an ICL translation task to see a similar\nphenomenon: a decisive gap in the emergence of first-task-token performance vs\nsecond-task-token performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u7ebf\u6027\u56de\u5f52\u5f0f\u8fde\u7eed\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\uff08ICL\uff09\u548c\u79bb\u6563\u5173\u8054\u53ec\u56de\u7684\u65b0\u73a9\u5177\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86Transformer\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6b64\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u9700\u5177\u5907\u4e24\u79cd\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e14\u8fd9\u4e24\u79cd\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u6001\u4e0d\u540c\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22Transformer\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7ed3\u5408\u8fde\u7eed\u548c\u79bb\u6563\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5176\u591a\u673a\u5236\u7279\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3Transformer\u6a21\u578b\u4e8e\u7b26\u53f7\u6807\u8bb0\u7684\u968f\u673a\u7ebf\u6027\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u52a8\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u5173\u8054\u53ec\u56de\u548c\u72b6\u6001\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u9700\u5206\u522b\u901a\u8fc7\u79bb\u6563\u6807\u7b7e\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8fdb\u884c\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u4e24\u79cd\u673a\u5236\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u6001\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u7c7b\u4f3c\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "conclusion": "Transformer\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u591a\u673a\u5236\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u8fd9\u4e9b\u673a\u5236\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u6001\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\u3002"}}

Furthermore, we propose the Spatial Distance Constraint to\nexplicitly enforce the model to learn patch-level relative relationships,\nresulting in clearer semantic boundaries and more accurate details.\nExperimental results demonstrate the zero-shot capabilities of DepthAnything-AC\nacross diverse benchmarks, including real-world adverse weather benchmarks,\nsynthetic corruption benchmarks, and general benchmarks.\n  Project Page: https://ghost233lism.github.io/depthanything-AC-page\n  Code: https://github.com/HVision-NKU/DepthAnythingAC", "AI": {"tldr": "DepthAnything-AC\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u7840\u5355\u76ee\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u591a\u6837\u73af\u5883\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5fae\u8c03\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u8ddd\u79bb\u7ea6\u675f\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7840MDE\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u590d\u6742\u5f00\u653e\u4e16\u754c\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u5149\u7167\u53d8\u5316\u3001\u6076\u52a3\u5929\u6c14\u548c\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u5931\u771f\u7b49\u6311\u6218\u6027\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5fae\u8c03\u8303\u5f0f\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u8ddd\u79bb\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b66\u4e60\u8865\u4e01\u7ea7\u76f8\u5bf9\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cDepthAnything-AC\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u6076\u52a3\u5929\u6c14\u548c\u5408\u6210\u635f\u574f\uff09\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "DepthAnything-AC\u5728\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u548c\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u751f\u6210\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Second, we design a robust feature encoder that combines a\nspecialized ConvNet with a denoising transformer to extract stable and reliable\nfeatures from degraded images. The ConvNet captures fine-grained local\nstructures, while the denoising transformer refines global representations,\neffectively mitigating the impact of noise, low visibility, and weather-induced\ndistortions.

However, its reliance on\nlarge volumes of labeled data raises privacy and security concerns such as\nsusceptibility to data poisoning attacks and the risk of overfitting. In\ncontrast, black box optimization methods, which treat the model as an opaque\nfunction, relying solely on function evaluations to guide optimization, offer a\npromising alternative in scenarios where data access is restricted, adversarial\nrisks are high, or overfitting is a concern. However, black box methods also\npose significant challenges, including poor scalability to high-dimensional\nparameter spaces, as prevalent in large language models (LLMs), and high\ncomputational costs due to reliance on numerous model evaluations. This paper\nintroduces BBoxER, an evolutionary black-box method for LLM post-training that\ninduces an information bottleneck via implicit compression of the training\ndata. Leveraging the tractability of information flow, we provide strong\ntheoretical bounds on generalization, differential privacy, susceptibility to\ndata poisoning attacks, and robustness to extraction attacks.

In experiments with LLMs, we\ndemonstrate empirically that Retrofitting methods are able to learn, showing\nhow a few iterations of BBoxER improve performance and generalize well on a\nbenchmark of reasoning datasets.

However, in real-world scenarios where\nannotation resources are limited, a vast amount of unlabeled data coexists with\nscarce labeled samples, leading to the Semi-Supervised LReID (Semi-LReID)\nproblem where LReID methods suffer severe performance degradation. Existing\nLReID methods, even when combined with semi-supervised strategies, suffer from\nlimited long-term adaptation performance due to struggling with the noisy\nknowledge occurring during unlabeled data utilization. In this paper, we\npioneer the investigation of Semi-LReID, introducing a novel Self-Reinforcing\nPrototype Evolution with Dual-Knowledge Cooperation framework (SPRED). Our key\ninnovation lies in establishing a self-reinforcing cycle between dynamic\nprototype-guided pseudo-label generation and new-old knowledge collaborative\npurification to enhance the utilization of unlabeled data. Specifically,\nlearnable identity prototypes are introduced to dynamically capture the\nidentity distributions and generate high-quality pseudo-labels. Then, the\ndual-knowledge cooperation scheme integrates current model specialization and\nhistorical model generalization, refining noisy pseudo-labels. Through this\ncyclic design, reliable pseudo-labels are progressively mined to improve\ncurrent-stage learning and ensure positive knowledge propagation over long-term\nlearning.

To address these limitations, we\npropose Reason50K, a large-scale dataset specifically curated for training and\nevaluating hypothetical instruction reasoning image editing, along with\nReasonBrain, a novel framework designed to reason over and execute implicit\nhypothetical instructions across diverse scenarios.

To address this, patient-specific digital twins\n(DT) modeling temporally varying motion were created to assess the accuracy of\nDIR methods. Approach: 21 motion phases simulating digestive GI motion as 4D\nsequences were generated from static 3D patient scans using published\nanalytical GI motion models through a semi-automated pipeline. Eleven datasets,\nincluding six T2w FSE MRI (T2w MRI), two T1w 4D golden-angle stack-of-stars,\nand three contrast-enhanced CT scans. The motion amplitudes of the DTs were\nassessed against real patient stomach motion amplitudes extracted from\nindependent 4D MRI datasets. The generated DTs were then used to assess six\ndifferent DIR methods using target registration error, Dice similarity\ncoefficient, and the 95th percentile Hausdorff distance using summary metrics\nand voxel-level granular visualizations. Finally, for a subset of T2w MRI scans\nfrom patients treated with MR-guided radiation therapy, dose distributions were\nwarped and accumulated to assess dose warping errors, including evaluations of\nDIR performance in both low- and high-dose regions for patient-specific error\nestimation. Main results: Our proposed pipeline synthesized DTs modeling\nrealistic GI motion, achieving mean and maximum motion amplitudes and a mean\nlog Jacobian determinant within 0.8 mm and 0.01, respectively, similar to\npublished real-patient gastric motion data.

However,\ncurrent approaches conventionally separate image customization into\nposition-aware and position-free customization paradigms and lack a universal\nframework for diverse customization, limiting their applications across various\nscenarios. To overcome these limitations, we propose IC-Custom, a unified\nframework that seamlessly integrates position-aware and position-free image\ncustomization through in-context learning. IC-Custom concatenates reference\nimages with target images to a polyptych, leveraging DiT's multi-modal\nattention mechanism for fine-grained token-level interactions. We introduce the\nIn-context Multi-Modal Attention (ICMA) mechanism with learnable task-oriented\nregister tokens and boundary-aware positional embeddings to enable the model to\ncorrectly handle different task types and distinguish various inputs in\npolyptych configurations. To bridge the data gap, we carefully curated a\nhigh-quality dataset of 12k identity-consistent samples with 8k from real-world\nsources and 4k from high-quality synthetic data, avoiding the overly glossy and\nover-saturated synthetic appearance. IC-Custom supports various industrial\napplications, including try-on, accessory placement, furniture arrangement, and\ncreative IP customization. Extensive evaluations on our proposed ProductBench\nand the publicly available DreamBench demonstrate that IC-Custom significantly\noutperforms community workflows, closed-source models, and state-of-the-art\nopen-source approaches.

In contrast to\nprior approaches, such as AdaLoRA, that rely on first-order (linearized)\napproximations of the loss function, SubLoRA utilizes second-order information\nto capture the potentially complex loss landscape by incorporating the Hessian\nmatrix. We show that the linearization becomes inaccurate and ill-conditioned\nwhen the LoRA parameters have been well optimized, motivating the need for a\nmore reliable and nuanced second-order formulation. To this end, we reformulate\nthe rank determination problem as a combinatorial optimization problem with a\nquadratic objective. However, solving this problem exactly is NP-hard in\ngeneral. To overcome the computational challenge, we introduce a submodular\nfunction maximization framework and devise a greedy algorithm with\napproximation guarantees. We derive a sufficient and necessary condition under\nwhich the rank-determination objective becomes submodular, and construct a\nclosed-form projection of the Hessian matrix that satisfies this condition\nwhile maintaining computational efficiency. Our method combines solid\ntheoretical foundations, second-order accuracy, and practical computational\nefficiency.

However, existing public datasets are\nprimarily composed of isolated text-video (T-V) pairs and thus fail to support\nthe modeling of coherent multi-clip video sequences. To address this\nlimitation, we introduce CI-VID, a dataset that moves beyond isolated\ntext-to-video (T2V) generation toward text-and-video-to-video (TV2V)\ngeneration, enabling models to produce coherent, multi-scene video sequences.\nCI-VID contains over 340,000 samples, each featuring a coherent sequence of\nvideo clips with text captions that capture both the individual content of each\nclip and the transitions between them, enabling visually and textually grounded\ngeneration. To further validate the effectiveness of CI-VID, we design a\ncomprehensive, multi-dimensional benchmark incorporating human evaluation,\nVLM-based assessment, and similarity-based metrics. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that models trained on CI-VID exhibit significant improvements in\nboth accuracy and content consistency when generating video sequences.

Long animation colorization has high labor costs. Therefore,\nautomated long animation colorization based on the video generation model has\nsignificant research value. Existing studies are limited to short-term\ncolorization. These studies adopt a local paradigm, fusing overlapping features\nto achieve smooth transitions between local segments. However, the local\nparadigm neglects global information, failing to maintain long-term color\nconsistency. In this study, we argue that ideal long-term color consistency can\nbe achieved through a dynamic global-local paradigm, i.e., dynamically\nextracting global color-consistent features relevant to the current generation.\nSpecifically, we propose LongAnimation, a novel framework, which mainly\nincludes a SketchDiT, a Dynamic Global-Local Memory (DGLM), and a Color\nConsistency Reward. The SketchDiT captures hybrid reference features to support\nthe DGLM module. The DGLM module employs a long video understanding model to\ndynamically compress global historical features and adaptively fuse them with\nthe current generation features. To refine the color consistency, we introduce\na Color Consistency Reward. During inference, we propose a color consistency\nfusion to smooth the video segment transition. Extensive experiments on both\nshort-term (14 frames) and long-term (average 500 frames) animations show the\neffectiveness of LongAnimation in maintaining short-term and long-term color\nconsistency for open-domain animation colorization task.

The development of Keye-VL rests on\ntwo core pillars: a massive, high-quality dataset exceeding 600 billion tokens\nwith a strong emphasis on video, and an innovative training recipe.

In this paper, we benchmark the performance of popular\nmultimodal foundation models (GPT-4o, o4-mini, Gemini 1.5 Pro and Gemini 2.0\nFlash, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Qwen2-VL, Llama 3.2) on standard computer vision\ntasks (semantic segmentation, object detection, image classification, depth and\nsurface normal prediction) using established datasets (e.g., COCO, ImageNet and\nits variants, etc).\n  The main challenges to performing this are: 1) most models are trained to\noutput text and cannot natively express versatile domains, such as segments or\n3D geometry, and 2) many leading models are proprietary and accessible only at\nan API level, i.e., there is no weight access to adapt them. We address these\nchallenges by translating standard vision tasks into equivalent text-promptable\nand API-compatible tasks via prompt chaining to create a standardized\nbenchmarking framework.\n  We observe that 1) the models are not close to the state-of-the-art\nspecialist models at any task. However, 2) they are respectable generalists;\nthis is remarkable as they are presumably trained on primarily image-text-based\ntasks. 3) They perform semantic tasks notably better than geometric ones. 4)\nWhile the prompt-chaining techniques affect performance, better models exhibit\nless sensitivity to prompt variations. 5) GPT-4o performs the best among\nnon-reasoning models, securing the top position in 4 out of 6 tasks, 6)\nreasoning models, e.g. o3, show improvements in geometric tasks, and 7) a\npreliminary analysis of models with native image generation, like the latest\nGPT-4o, shows they exhibit quirks like hallucinations and spatial\nmisalignments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5b83\u4eec\u867d\u4e0d\u53ca\u4e13\u4e1a\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f46\u4f5c\u4e3a\u901a\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u5c1a\u53ef\uff0c\u4e14\u8bed\u4e49\u4efb\u52a1\u4f18\u4e8e\u51e0\u4f55\u4efb\u52a1\u3002GPT-4o\u5728\u975e\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u7406\u89e3\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u793a\u94fe\u5c06\u6807\u51c6\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u6587\u672c\u53ef\u63d0\u793a\u548cAPI\u517c\u5bb9\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u51e0\u4f55\u4efb\u52a1\uff0cGPT-4o\u5728\u975e\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u4f46\u5747\u672a\u8fbe\u5230\u4e13\u4e1a\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u5c1a\u53ef\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u6709\u6539\u8fdb\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u51e0\u4f55\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u63d0\u793a\u654f\u611f\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u3002"}}

Traditional autoregressive image generation\nrelies on next-patch prediction, a memory-bound process that leads to high\nlatency. Existing works have tried to parallelize next-patch prediction by\nshifting to multi-patch prediction to accelerate the process, but only achieved\nlimited parallelization. To achieve high parallelization while maintaining\ngeneration quality, we introduce two key techniques: (1) Flexible Parallelized\nAutoregressive Modeling, a novel architecture that enables arbitrary generation\nordering and degrees of parallelization. It uses learnable position query\ntokens to guide generation at target positions while ensuring mutual visibility\namong concurrently generated tokens for consistent parallel decoding. (2)\nLocality-aware Generation Ordering, a novel schedule that forms groups to\nminimize intra-group dependencies and maximize contextual support, enhancing\ngeneration quality. With these designs, we reduce the generation steps from 256\nto 20 (256$\\times$256 res.) and 1024 to 48 (512$\\times$512 res.) without\ncompromising quality on the ImageNet class-conditional generation, and\nachieving at least 3.4$\\times$ lower latency than previous parallelized\nautoregressive models.", "AI": {"tldr": "Locality-aware Parallel Decoding (LPD) \u901a\u8fc7\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u5e76\u884c\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u611f\u77e5\u751f\u6210\u987a\u5e8f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u52a0\u901f\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u751f\u6210\u6b65\u9aa4\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u4f9d\u8d56\u987a\u5e8f\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u9ad8\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c1d\u8bd5\u5e76\u884c\u5316\u4f46\u6548\u679c\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u9700\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u5e76\u884c\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u6280\u672f\uff1a1) \u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u5e76\u884c\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4efb\u610f\u751f\u6210\u987a\u5e8f\u548c\u5e76\u884c\u5ea6\uff1b2) \u5c40\u90e8\u611f\u77e5\u751f\u6210\u987a\u5e8f\uff0c\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u7ec4\u5185\u4f9d\u8d56\u5e76\u6700\u5927\u5316\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u652f\u6301\u3002", "result": "\u5728 ImageNet \u7c7b\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\uff0c\u5c06\u751f\u6210\u6b65\u9aa4\u4ece 256 \u51cf\u5c11\u5230 20\uff08256\u00d7256 \u5206\u8fa8\u7387\uff09\u548c 1024 \u51cf\u5c11\u5230 48\uff08512\u00d7512 \u5206\u8fa8\u7387\uff09\uff0c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e\u81f3\u5c11 3.4 \u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "LPD \u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5e76\u884c\u5316\u6548\u7387\u548c\u751f\u6210\u901f\u5ea6\u3002"}}
