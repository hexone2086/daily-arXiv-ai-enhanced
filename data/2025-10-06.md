### [2] [Oracle-RLAIF: An Improved Fine-Tuning Framework for Multi-modal Video Models through Reinforcement Learning from Ranking Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02561)
*Derek Shi,Ruben Glatt,Christine Klymko,Shubham Mohole,Hongjun Choi,Shashank Kushwaha,Sam Sakla,Felipe Leno da Silva*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Oracle-RLAIF框架，用通用的Oracle排序器替代训练好的奖励模型，通过基于排名的反馈来优化视频语言模型，降低人工反馈成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着视频语言模型参数规模扩大，收集足够人类反馈的成本急剧增加。现有的基于AI反馈的强化学习方法依赖专门的奖励模型，这种流程昂贵且受限。

Method: 使用Oracle排序器替代训练好的奖励模型，该排序器对候选模型响应进行排序而非打分。同时提出了基于GRPO的排名损失函数$GRPO_{rank}$，直接优化序数反馈并考虑排名优势。

Result: 经验证明Oracle-RLAIF在多个视频理解基准测试中持续优于使用现有微调方法的领先视频语言模型。

Conclusion: Oracle-RLAIF为创建灵活且数据高效的大型多模态视频模型对齐框架开辟了新路径，通过基于排名而非分数的强化学习来实现模型对齐。

Abstract: Recent advances in large video-language models (VLMs) rely on extensive
fine-tuning techniques that strengthen alignment between textual and visual
comprehension. Leading pipelines typically pair supervised fine-tuning (SFT)
with reinforcement learning from preference data to enhance video
comprehension. However, as VLMs scale in parameter size, so does the cost of
gathering enough human feedback. To make fine-tuning more cost-effective,
recent frameworks explore reinforcement learning with AI feedback (RLAIF),
which replace human preference with AI as a judge. Current RLAIF frameworks
rely on a specialized reward model trained with video narratives to create
calibrated scalar rewards -- an expensive and restrictive pipeline. We propose
Oracle-RLAIF, a novel framework that replaces the trained reward model with a
more general Oracle ranker which acts as a drop-in model ranking candidate
model responses rather than scoring them. Alongside Oracle-RLAIF, we introduce
$GRPO_{rank}$, a novel rank-based loss function based on Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) that directly optimizes ordinal feedback with rank-aware
advantages. Empirically, we demonstrate that Oracle-RLAIF consistently
outperforms leading VLMs using existing fine-tuning methods when evaluated
across various video comprehension benchmarks. Oracle-RLAIF paves the path to
creating flexible and data-efficient frameworks for aligning large multi-modal
video models with reinforcement learning from rank rather than score.

Conclusion: 该框架通过统一的视觉到动作学习，实现了物理基础和视觉对齐的运动重建，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Reconstructing physically plausible human motion from monocular videos
remains a challenging problem in computer vision and graphics. Existing methods
primarily focus on kinematics-based pose estimation, often leading to
unrealistic results due to the lack of physical constraints. To address such
artifacts, prior methods have typically relied on physics-based post-processing
following the initial kinematics-based motion estimation. However, this
two-stage design introduces error accumulation, ultimately limiting the overall
reconstruction quality. In this paper, we present PhysHMR, a unified framework
that directly learns a visual-to-action policy for humanoid control in a
physics-based simulator, enabling motion reconstruction that is both physically
grounded and visually aligned with the input video. A key component of our
approach is the pixel-as-ray strategy, which lifts 2D keypoints into 3D spatial
rays and transforms them into global space. These rays are incorporated as
policy inputs, providing robust global pose guidance without depending on noisy
3D root predictions. This soft global grounding, combined with local visual
features from a pretrained encoder, allows the policy to reason over both
detailed pose and global positioning. To overcome the sample inefficiency of
reinforcement learning, we further introduce a distillation scheme that
transfers motion knowledge from a mocap-trained expert to the
vision-conditioned policy, which is then refined using physically motivated
reinforcement learning rewards. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PhysHMR
produces high-fidelity, physically plausible motion across diverse scenarios,
outperforming prior approaches in both visual accuracy and physical realism.

Motivation: 研究人机协作面部识别系统的准确率提升条件，探索如何有效结合人类和机器的优势来提高识别准确率。

Method: 使用专家和非专家面部识别者的数据，分析人-人和人-机协作效果，提出近端准确率规则(PAR)，建立关键融合区域，并实施智能人机融合策略。

Result: 发现协作效益随着协作者间基线准确率差异的减小而增加，关键融合区域范围很大，智能人机融合比单独机器或所有人机判断组合更准确。

Conclusion: 人机协作在面部识别中具有重要作用，智能融合能有效提高系统准确率并减少低性能人类的影响，为AI在面部识别中的智能使用提供了循证路线图。

Abstract: Human review of consequential decisions by face recognition algorithms
creates a "collaborative" human-machine system. Individual differences between
people and machines, however, affect whether collaboration improves or degrades
accuracy in any given case. We establish the circumstances under which
combining human and machine face identification decisions improves accuracy.
Using data from expert and non-expert face identifiers, we examined the
benefits of human-human and human-machine collaborations. The benefits of
collaboration increased as the difference in baseline accuracy between
collaborators decreased-following the Proximal Accuracy Rule (PAR). This rule
predicted collaborative (fusion) benefit across a wide range of baseline
abilities, from people with no training to those with extensive training. Using
the PAR, we established a critical fusion zone, where humans are less accurate
than the machine, but fusing the two improves system accuracy. This zone was
surprisingly large. We implemented "intelligent human-machine fusion" by
selecting people with the potential to increase the accuracy of a
high-performing machine. Intelligent fusion was more accurate than the machine
operating alone and more accurate than combining all human and machine
judgments. The highest system-wide accuracy achievable with human-only
partnerships was found by graph theory. This fully human system approximated
the average performance achieved by intelligent human-machine collaboration.
However, intelligent human-machine collaboration more effectively minimized the
impact of low-performing humans on system-wide accuracy. The results
demonstrate a meaningful role for both humans and machines in assuring accurate
face identification. This study offers an evidence-based road map for the
intelligent use of AI in face identification.

### [5] [How Confident are Video Models? Empowering Video Models to Express their Uncertainty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02571)
*Zhiting Mei,Ola Shorinwa,Anirudha Majumdar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了首个视频生成模型不确定性量化框架S-QUBED，包含校准评估指标、黑盒UQ方法和基准数据集，能分解预测不确定性的偶然性和认知性成分。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频生成模型会产生事实错误的幻觉，但现有研究缺乏视频模型的不确定性量化方法，存在安全隐患。

Method: 基于潜在空间建模，通过稳健秩相关估计评估校准，使用S-QUBED方法分解不确定性为偶然性和认知性成分。

Result: S-QUBED能计算与任务准确度负相关的校准总不确定性估计，并有效分解不确定性成分。

Conclusion: 这是首个视频模型不确定性量化工作，提出的框架能可靠评估和分解视频生成的不确定性。

Abstract: Generative video models demonstrate impressive text-to-video capabilities,
spurring widespread adoption in many real-world applications. However, like
large language models (LLMs), video generation models tend to hallucinate,
producing plausible videos even when they are factually wrong. Although
uncertainty quantification (UQ) of LLMs has been extensively studied in prior
work, no UQ method for video models exists, raising critical safety concerns.
To our knowledge, this paper represents the first work towards quantifying the
uncertainty of video models. We present a framework for uncertainty
quantification of generative video models, consisting of: (i) a metric for
evaluating the calibration of video models based on robust rank correlation
estimation with no stringent modeling assumptions; (ii) a black-box UQ method
for video models (termed S-QUBED), which leverages latent modeling to
rigorously decompose predictive uncertainty into its aleatoric and epistemic
components; and (iii) a UQ dataset to facilitate benchmarking calibration in
video models. By conditioning the generation task in the latent space, we
disentangle uncertainty arising due to vague task specifications from that
arising from lack of knowledge. Through extensive experiments on benchmark
video datasets, we demonstrate that S-QUBED computes calibrated total
uncertainty estimates that are negatively correlated with the task accuracy and
effectively computes the aleatoric and epistemic constituents.

### [6] [PEO: Training-Free Aesthetic Quality Enhancement in Pre-Trained Text-to-Image Diffusion Models with Prompt Embedding Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02599)
*Hovhannes Margaryan,Bo Wan,Tinne Tuytelaars*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Prompt Embedding Optimization (PEO)方法，通过优化文本嵌入来提升预训练文本到图像扩散模型的美学质量，无需额外训练且与主干模型无关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决预训练文本到图像扩散模型在简单提示词下生成图像美学质量不足的问题，避免需要精心设计提示词或额外训练。

Method: 使用三重目标函数优化文本嵌入：提升生成图像的美学保真度、确保与优化后文本嵌入的一致性、通过提示词保留项最小化与初始提示词的差异。

Result: 定量和定性评估表明该方法有效，性能达到或超过最先进的文本到图像和提示词适应方法。

Conclusion: PEO是一种无需训练、主干模型无关的方法，能够有效提升简单提示词下生成图像的美学质量。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to aesthetic quality improvement in
pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models when given a simple prompt. Our
method, dubbed Prompt Embedding Optimization (PEO), leverages a pre-trained
text-to-image diffusion model as a backbone and optimizes the text embedding of
a given simple and uncurated prompt to enhance the visual quality of the
generated image. We achieve this by a tripartite objective function that
improves the aesthetic fidelity of the generated image, ensures adherence to
the optimized text embedding, and minimal divergence from the initial prompt.
The latter is accomplished through a prompt preservation term. Additionally,
PEO is training-free and backbone-independent. Quantitative and qualitative
evaluations confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method, exceeding or
equating the performance of state-of-the-art text-to-image and prompt
adaptation methods.

### [7] [Ego-Exo 3D Hand Tracking in the Wild with a Mobile Multi-Camera Rig](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02601)
*Patrick Rim,Kun He,Kevin Harris,Braden Copple,Shangchen Han,Sizhe An,Ivan Shugurov,Tomas Hodan,He Wen,Xu Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型无标记多相机系统，用于在野外条件下精确捕捉3D手部姿势和物体交互，解决了现有数据集环境多样性不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有手部追踪数据集主要在受控实验室环境中采集，限制了环境多样性和模型泛化能力，需要开发能在真实野外条件下精确追踪手部交互的方法。

Method: 设计轻量级背载式捕捉装置，包含8个外中心相机和Meta Quest 3头显提供的2个自我中心视角，开发了自我-外部追踪流程来生成准确的3D手部姿势真值。

Result: 构建了包含同步多视角图像和精确3D手部姿势的标注数据集，显著降低了环境真实性与3D标注精度之间的权衡。

Conclusion: 该方法能够在几乎不受限制的移动性条件下，在真实野外环境中实现精确的3D手部和物体追踪，为无约束环境下的手部交互研究提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Accurate 3D tracking of hands and their interactions with the world in
unconstrained settings remains a significant challenge for egocentric computer
vision. With few exceptions, existing datasets are predominantly captured in
controlled lab setups, limiting environmental diversity and model
generalization. To address this, we introduce a novel marker-less multi-camera
system designed to capture precise 3D hands and objects, which allows for
nearly unconstrained mobility in genuinely in-the-wild conditions. We combine a
lightweight, back-mounted capture rig with eight exocentric cameras, and a
user-worn Meta Quest 3 headset, which contributes two egocentric views. We
design an ego-exo tracking pipeline to generate accurate 3D hand pose ground
truth from this system, and rigorously evaluate its quality. By collecting an
annotated dataset featuring synchronized multi-view images and precise 3D hand
poses, we demonstrate the capability of our approach to significantly reduce
the trade-off between environmental realism and 3D annotation accuracy.

### [8] [Input-Aware Sparse Attention for Real-Time Co-Speech Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02617)
*Beijia Lu,Ziyi Chen,Jing Xiao,Jun-Yan Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于输入人体姿态条件的视频蒸馏方法，通过稀疏注意力机制和输入感知蒸馏损失，将多步扩散模型蒸馏为少步学生模型，实现实时性能并提升视觉质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于扩散的语音驱动视频生成方法由于大量去噪步骤和昂贵的注意力机制导致速度慢，无法实现实时部署。

Method: 1）利用输入人体姿态关键点的准确对应关系指导注意力到相关区域（如面部、手部、上半身）；2）提出输入感知稀疏注意力减少冗余计算；3）引入输入感知蒸馏损失提升唇部同步和手部运动真实感。

Result: 方法实现了实时性能，相比最近的音频驱动和输入驱动方法具有更好的视觉质量。

Conclusion: 通过整合输入感知稀疏注意力和蒸馏损失，该方法在保持高质量的同时显著提升了推理效率。

Abstract: Diffusion models can synthesize realistic co-speech video from audio for
various applications, such as video creation and virtual agents. However,
existing diffusion-based methods are slow due to numerous denoising steps and
costly attention mechanisms, preventing real-time deployment. In this work, we
distill a many-step diffusion video model into a few-step student model.
Unfortunately, directly applying recent diffusion distillation methods degrades
video quality and falls short of real-time performance. To address these
issues, our new video distillation method leverages input human pose
conditioning for both attention and loss functions. We first propose using
accurate correspondence between input human pose keypoints to guide attention
to relevant regions, such as the speaker's face, hands, and upper body. This
input-aware sparse attention reduces redundant computations and strengthens
temporal correspondences of body parts, improving inference efficiency and
motion coherence. To further enhance visual quality, we introduce an
input-aware distillation loss that improves lip synchronization and hand motion
realism. By integrating our input-aware sparse attention and distillation loss,
our method achieves real-time performance with improved visual quality compared
to recent audio-driven and input-driven methods. We also conduct extensive
experiments showing the effectiveness of our algorithmic design choices.

*Victor Enescu,Hichem Sahbi*

Main category: cs.CV

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度生成模型在增量训练中的灾难性遗忘问题，避免传统方法中训练时间不断增加和依赖合成数据导致性能下降的局限性。

Method: 设计了一种基于低秩适应(LoRA)的功能性条件机制FunLoRA，使用秩1矩阵并通过精心选择的函数增加重参数化矩阵的秩，实现动态条件化。

Result: 实验表明该方法在基于流匹配的模型上超越了基于扩散模型的先前最优结果，达到了更高的分类准确率，同时仅需少量内存成本和采样时间。

Conclusion: FunLoRA方法能够有效避免灾难性遗忘，仅需在当前任务数据上训练，在参数效率、内存成本和采样时间方面均表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Continual adaptation of deep generative models holds tremendous potential and
critical importance, given their rapid and expanding usage in text and vision
based applications. Incremental training, however, remains highly challenging
due to catastrophic forgetting phenomenon, which makes it difficult for neural
networks to effectively incorporate new knowledge. A common strategy consists
in retraining the generative model on its own synthetic data in order to
mitigate forgetting. Yet, such an approach faces two major limitations: (i) the
continually increasing training time eventually becomes intractable, and (ii)
reliance on synthetic data inevitably leads to long-term performance
degradation, since synthetic samples lack the richness of real training data.
In this paper, we attenuate these issues by designing a novel and more
expressive conditioning mechanism for generative models based on low rank
adaptation (LoRA), that exclusively employs rank 1 matrices, whose
reparametrized matrix rank is functionally increased using carefully selected
functions -- and dubbed functional LoRA: FunLoRA. Using this dynamic
conditioning, the generative model is guaranteed to avoid catastrophic
forgetting and needs only to be trained on data from the current task.
Extensive experiments using flow-matching based models trained from scratch,
showcase that our proposed parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method
surpasses prior state-of-the-art results based on diffusion models, reaching
higher classification accuracy scores, while only requiring a fraction of the
memory cost and sampling time.

### [10] [Sequence-Preserving Dual-FoV Defense for Traffic Sign and Light Recognition in Autonomous Vehicles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02642)
*Abhishek Joshi,Jahnavi Krishna Koda,Abhishek Phadke*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一个双视野、序列保持的鲁棒性框架，用于美国交通灯和标志识别，通过统一三层防御堆栈（特征压缩、防御蒸馏、基于熵的异常检测）和时序投票，在多种操作设计域下提升模型对数字和自然干扰的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶车辆中交通灯和标志识别错误直接影响导航和安全，现有方法缺乏对时间连续性、多静态视野感知以及数字和自然干扰鲁棒性的考虑。

Method: 基于aiMotive、Udacity、Waymo和自录视频构建多源数据集，在高速公路、夜间、雨天和城市四种操作设计域下对齐RGB图像序列，采用统一三层防御堆栈框架结合时序投票机制。

Result: 统一防御堆栈达到79.8mAP，将攻击成功率降至18.2%，优于YOLOv8、YOLOv9和BEVFormer，同时将高风险误分类降至32%。

Conclusion: 该框架显著提升了交通灯和标志识别系统对数字和自然干扰的鲁棒性，为自动驾驶安全提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Traffic light and sign recognition are key for Autonomous Vehicles (AVs)
because perception mistakes directly influence navigation and safety. In
addition to digital adversarial attacks, models are vulnerable to existing
perturbations (glare, rain, dirt, or graffiti), which could lead to dangerous
misclassifications. The current work lacks consideration of temporal
continuity, multistatic field-of-view (FoV) sensing, and robustness to both
digital and natural degradation. This study proposes a dual FoV,
sequence-preserving robustness framework for traffic lights and signs in the
USA based on a multi-source dataset built on aiMotive, Udacity, Waymo, and
self-recorded videos from the region of Texas. Mid and long-term sequences of
RGB images are temporally aligned for four operational design domains (ODDs):
highway, night, rainy, and urban. Over a series of experiments on a real-life
application of anomaly detection, this study outlines a unified three-layer
defense stack framework that incorporates feature squeezing, defensive
distillation, and entropy-based anomaly detection, as well as sequence-wise
temporal voting for further enhancement. The evaluation measures included
accuracy, attack success rate (ASR), risk-weighted misclassification severity,
and confidence stability. Physical transferability was confirmed using probes
for recapture. The results showed that the Unified Defense Stack achieved
79.8mAP and reduced the ASR to 18.2%, which is superior to YOLOv8, YOLOv9, and
BEVFormer, while reducing the high-risk misclassification to 32%.

### [11] [Smart-GRPO: Smartly Sampling Noise for Efficient RL of Flow-Matching Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02654)
*Benjamin Yu,Jackie Liu,Justin Cui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Smart-GRPO是首个针对流匹配模型中强化学习的噪声扰动优化方法，通过迭代搜索策略改进噪声分布，提高奖励优化和视觉质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 流匹配模型的确定性特性使其不适合强化学习，而现有方法通过随机噪声扰动效率低下且不稳定。

Method: 采用迭代搜索策略：解码候选扰动、用奖励函数评估、向高奖励区域优化噪声分布。

Result: 实验表明Smart-GRPO在奖励优化和视觉质量方面优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 为流匹配框架中的强化学习提供了实用路径，弥合了高效训练与人类对齐生成之间的差距。

Abstract: Recent advancements in flow-matching have enabled high-quality text-to-image
generation. However, the deterministic nature of flow-matching models makes
them poorly suited for reinforcement learning, a key tool for improving image
quality and human alignment. Prior work has introduced stochasticity by
perturbing latents with random noise, but such perturbations are inefficient
and unstable. We propose Smart-GRPO, the first method to optimize noise
perturbations for reinforcement learning in flow-matching models. Smart-GRPO
employs an iterative search strategy that decodes candidate perturbations,
evaluates them with a reward function, and refines the noise distribution
toward higher-reward regions. Experiments demonstrate that Smart-GRPO improves
both reward optimization and visual quality compared to baseline methods. Our
results suggest a practical path toward reinforcement learning in flow-matching
frameworks, bridging the gap between efficient training and human-aligned
generation.

### [12] [FSFSplatter: Build Surface and Novel Views with Sparse-Views within 3min](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02691)
*Yibin Zhao,Yihan Pan,Jun Nan,Jianjun Yi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FSFSplatter是一种从自由稀疏图像进行快速表面重建的新方法，通过端到端密集高斯初始化、相机参数估计和几何增强场景优化，解决了传统方法需要密集校准视图的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有高斯泼溅方法大多需要密集、校准的视图，而从自由稀疏图像重建往往由于有限重叠和过拟合导致表面质量差。

Method: 使用大型Transformer编码多视图图像，通过自分裂高斯头生成密集且几何一致的高斯场景初始化，采用贡献度修剪消除局部漂浮物，在快速优化期间利用深度和多视图特征监督以及可微相机参数缓解过拟合。

Result: FSFSplatter在广泛使用的DTU和Replica数据集上优于当前最先进方法。

Conclusion: 该方法能够从自由稀疏图像实现高质量的表面重建，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Gaussian Splatting has become a leading reconstruction technique, known for
its high-quality novel view synthesis and detailed reconstruction. However,
most existing methods require dense, calibrated views. Reconstructing from free
sparse images often leads to poor surface due to limited overlap and
overfitting. We introduce FSFSplatter, a new approach for fast surface
reconstruction from free sparse images. Our method integrates end-to-end dense
Gaussian initialization, camera parameter estimation, and geometry-enhanced
scene optimization. Specifically, FSFSplatter employs a large Transformer to
encode multi-view images and generates a dense and geometrically consistent
Gaussian scene initialization via a self-splitting Gaussian head. It eliminates
local floaters through contribution-based pruning and mitigates overfitting to
limited views by leveraging depth and multi-view feature supervision with
differentiable camera parameters during rapid optimization. FSFSplatter
outperforms current state-of-the-art methods on widely used DTU and Replica.

### [13] [MoGIC: Boosting Motion Generation via Intention Understanding and Visual Context](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02722)
*Junyu Shi,Yong Sun,Zhiyuan Zhang,Lijiang Liu,Zhengjie Zhang,Yuxin He,Qiang Nie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MoGIC是一个统一的多模态运动生成框架，通过整合意图建模和视觉先验来改进文本驱动的运动生成，解决了现有方法在捕捉动作执行因果逻辑和人类意图方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本驱动运动生成方法将合成视为语言和运动之间的双向映射，但在捕捉动作执行的因果逻辑和驱动行为的人类意图方面存在局限。缺乏视觉基础进一步限制了精度和个性化，因为仅靠语言无法指定细粒度的时空细节。

Method: MoGIC通过联合优化多模态条件运动生成和意图预测，揭示潜在的人类目标，利用视觉先验增强生成能力。引入了具有自适应范围的混合注意力机制，实现条件标记和运动子序列之间的有效局部对齐。

Result: 实验表明，微调后MoGIC在HumanML3D上FID降低了38.6%，在Mo440H上降低了34.6%，在运动描述方面超越了基于LLM的方法，并进一步实现了意图预测和视觉条件生成。

Conclusion: MoGIC推进了可控运动合成和意图理解，展示了统一的多模态运动生成框架的有效性。

Abstract: Existing text-driven motion generation methods often treat synthesis as a
bidirectional mapping between language and motion, but remain limited in
capturing the causal logic of action execution and the human intentions that
drive behavior. The absence of visual grounding further restricts precision and
personalization, as language alone cannot specify fine-grained spatiotemporal
details. We propose MoGIC, a unified framework that integrates intention
modeling and visual priors into multimodal motion synthesis. By jointly
optimizing multimodal-conditioned motion generation and intention prediction,
MoGIC uncovers latent human goals, leverages visual priors to enhance
generation, and exhibits versatile multimodal generative capability. We further
introduce a mixture-of-attention mechanism with adaptive scope to enable
effective local alignment between conditional tokens and motion subsequences.
To support this paradigm, we curate Mo440H, a 440-hour benchmark from 21
high-quality motion datasets. Experiments show that after finetuning, MoGIC
reduces FID by 38.6\% on HumanML3D and 34.6\% on Mo440H, surpasses LLM-based
methods in motion captioning with a lightweight text head, and further enables
intention prediction and vision-conditioned generation, advancing controllable
motion synthesis and intention understanding. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种运动自适应的3D重建框架，通过运动复杂性对齐控制点密度，在动态区域集中控制点，抑制静态背景冗余，并使用样条轨迹参数化实现更平滑的运动表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有稀疏控制方法存在控制点分配与运动复杂度不匹配的问题：纯几何分配导致静态区域冗余和动态区域不足。

Method: 利用视觉基础模型的语义和运动先验，建立patch-token-node对应关系，应用运动自适应压缩，通过迭代体素化和运动趋势评分实现表示密度自适应，并用样条轨迹参数化替代MLP变形场。

Result: 在重建质量和效率方面相比现有最先进方法有显著提升。

Conclusion: 该运动自适应框架有效解决了控制点分配与运动复杂度的不匹配问题，实现了更高质量的动态3D重建。

Abstract: Dynamic 3D reconstruction from monocular videos remains difficult due to the
ambiguity inferring 3D motion from limited views and computational demands of
modeling temporally varying scenes. While recent sparse control methods
alleviate computation by reducing millions of Gaussians to thousands of control
points, they suffer from a critical limitation: they allocate points purely by
geometry, leading to static redundancy and dynamic insufficiency. We propose a
motion-adaptive framework that aligns control density with motion complexity.
Leveraging semantic and motion priors from vision foundation models, we
establish patch-token-node correspondences and apply motion-adaptive
compression to concentrate control points in dynamic regions while suppressing
redundancy in static backgrounds. Our approach achieves flexible
representational density adaptation through iterative voxelization and motion
tendency scoring, directly addressing the fundamental mismatch between control
point allocation and motion complexity. To capture temporal evolution, we
introduce spline-based trajectory parameterization initialized by 2D tracklets,
replacing MLP-based deformation fields to achieve smoother motion
representation and more stable optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate
significant improvements in reconstruction quality and efficiency over existing
state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统去噪方法依赖手工先验，难以处理复杂真实噪声；深度学习方法需要大量标注数据且泛化能力有限。需要一种能结合两者优势的方法。

Method: 提出Net2Net混合框架，结合无监督深度图像先验(DIP)和监督预训练网络DRUNet，通过正则化去噪(RED)进行集成。无监督网络适应输入图像特定噪声，预训练网络提供鲁棒去噪性能。

Result: 在基准数据集上的大量实验表明，该方法在真实世界噪声去除方面表现优越，特别是在训练数据有限的情况下。

Conclusion: Net2Net通过结合无监督和监督网络的混合方法，有效解决了真实世界噪声去除的挑战，提高了泛化能力和性能。

Abstract: Traditional denoising methods for noise removal have largely relied on
handcrafted priors, often perform well in controlled environments but struggle
to address the complexity and variability of real noise. In contrast, deep
learning-based approaches have gained prominence for learning noise
characteristics from large datasets, but these methods frequently require
extensive labeled data and may not generalize effectively across diverse noise
types and imaging conditions. In this paper, we present an innovative method,
termed as Net2Net, that combines the strengths of untrained and pre-trained
networks to tackle the challenges of real-world noise removal. The innovation
of Net2Net lies in its combination of unsupervised DIP and supervised
pre-trained model DRUNet by regularization by denoising (RED). The untrained
network adapts to the unique noise characteristics of each input image without
requiring labeled data, while the pre-trained network leverages learned
representations from large-scale datasets to deliver robust denoising
performance. This hybrid framework enhances generalization across varying noise
patterns and improves performance, particularly in scenarios with limited
training data. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the
superiority of our method for real-world noise removal.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Retrv-R1是首个专为多模态通用检索设计的R1风格MLLM，通过逐步推理提高检索准确性，解决了DeepSeek-R1直接应用于检索任务时的计算成本高和训练不稳定的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DeepSeek-R1展示了RL增强LLM推理能力的潜力，但直接应用于检索任务不可行，主要因为多候选推理过程导致的高计算成本，以及RL训练检索任务时的不稳定性和次优结果。

Method: 引入信息压缩模块和细节检查机制减少token数量但保留关键信息；提出新训练范式，包括使用检索定制合成CoT数据集的激活阶段，以及带有课程奖励的RL训练。

Result: Retrv-R1在多个基准测试和任务中实现了SOTA性能、高效率和强泛化能力。

Conclusion: 通过信息压缩和新的训练范式，Retrv-R1成功解决了R1风格模型在检索任务中的应用挑战，实现了优异的性能表现。

Abstract: The success of DeepSeek-R1 demonstrates the immense potential of using
reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance LLMs' reasoning capabilities. This paper
introduces Retrv-R1, the first R1-style MLLM specifically designed for
multimodal universal retrieval, achieving higher performance by employing
step-by-step reasoning to produce more accurate retrieval results. We find that
directly applying the methods of DeepSeek-R1 to retrieval tasks is not
feasible, mainly due to (1) the high computational cost caused by the large
token consumption required for multiple candidates with reasoning processes,
and (2) the instability and suboptimal results when directly applying RL to
train for retrieval tasks. To address these issues, Retrv-R1 introduces an
information compression module with a details inspection mechanism, which
enhances computational efficiency by reducing the number of tokens while
ensuring that critical information for challenging candidates is preserved.
Furthermore, a new training paradigm is proposed, including an activation stage
using a retrieval-tailored synthetic CoT dataset for more effective
optimization, followed by RL with a novel curriculum reward to improve both
performance and efficiency. Incorporating these novel designs, Retrv-R1
achieves SOTA performance, high efficiency, and strong generalization ability,
as demonstrated by experiments across multiple benchmarks and tasks.

TL;DR: BCA+是一个无需训练、基于贝叶斯推理的测试时自适应框架，通过动态缓存机制同时适应物体识别和检测任务，在保持高效性的同时提升模型在分布偏移下的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的测试时自适应方法要么依赖计算昂贵的反向传播，要么只关注似然适应而忽略先验的重要性，限制了实时部署效果。

Method: 引入动态缓存机制，自适应存储和更新类别嵌入、空间尺度（用于检测）以及基于历史预测的自适应类别先验，通过贝叶斯推理融合初始VLM输出与基于缓存的预测。

Result: 在识别和检测基准测试中达到最先进性能，无需反向传播的高效方法。

Conclusion: BCA+通过双适应机制和不确定性引导融合，有效校正模型的语义理解和上下文置信度，为视觉语言模型在真实世界分布偏移下的应用提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP and Grounding DINO have achieved
remarkable success in object recognition and detection. However, their
performance often degrades under real-world distribution shifts. Test-time
adaptation (TTA) aims to mitigate this issue by adapting models during
inference. Existing methods either rely on computationally expensive
backpropagation, which hinders real-time deployment, or focus solely on
likelihood adaptation, which overlooks the critical role of the prior. Our
prior work, Bayesian Class Adaptation (BCA), addressed these shortcomings for
object recognition by introducing a training-free framework that incorporates
adaptive priors. Building upon this foundation, we now present Bayesian Class
Adaptation plus (BCA+), a unified, training-free framework for TTA for both
object recognition and detection. BCA+ introduces a dynamic cache that
adaptively stores and updates class embeddings, spatial scales (for detection),
and, crucially, adaptive class priors derived from historical predictions. We
formulate adaptation as a Bayesian inference problem, where final predictions
are generated by fusing the initial VLM output with a cache-based prediction.
This cache-based prediction combines a dynamically updated likelihood
(measuring feature and scale similarity) and a prior (reflecting the evolving
class distribution). This dual-adaptation mechanism, coupled with
uncertainty-guided fusion, enables BCA+ to correct both the model's semantic
understanding and its contextual confidence. As a training-free method
requiring no backpropagation, BCA+ is highly efficient. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that BCA+ achieves state-of-the-art performance on both recognition
and detection benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于脑肿瘤分类的层次化广义类别发现方法（HGCD-BT），通过结合层次聚类和对比学习，能够识别训练时未见过的肿瘤类别，在OpenSRH数据集上比现有GCD方法准确率提升28%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有脑肿瘤分类方法局限于预定义类别，无法识别训练时未见的肿瘤类型。无监督学习缺乏利用标注数据先验知识的能力，而半监督方法假设所有潜在类别都在标注数据中。广义类别发现（GCD）旨在同时分类已知和未知类别。

Method: HGCD-BT将层次聚类与对比学习相结合，在对比学习基础上引入半监督层次聚类损失函数，能够捕捉脑肿瘤分类学的层次结构。

Result: 在OpenSRH数据集上，HGCD-BT在斑块级分类中比最先进的GCD方法准确率提升28%，特别是在识别未见过的肿瘤类别方面表现优异。在Digital Brain Tumor Atlas的玻片级分类中也验证了方法的通用性。

Conclusion: HGCD-BT方法能够有效识别已知和未知的脑肿瘤类别，在多种成像模态中都表现出良好的通用性，为神经肿瘤手术中的术中决策提供了更准确的分类工具。

Abstract: Accurate brain tumor classification is critical for intra-operative decision
making in neuro-oncological surgery. However, existing approaches are
restricted to a fixed set of predefined classes and are therefore unable to
capture patterns of tumor types not available during training. Unsupervised
learning can extract general-purpose features, but it lacks the ability to
incorporate prior knowledge from labelled data, and semi-supervised methods
often assume that all potential classes are represented in the labelled data.
Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) aims to bridge this gap by categorizing
both known and unknown classes within unlabelled data. To reflect the
hierarchical structure of brain tumor taxonomies, in this work, we introduce
Hierarchical Generalized Category Discovery for Brain Tumor Classification
(HGCD-BT), a novel approach that integrates hierarchical clustering with
contrastive learning. Our method extends contrastive learning based GCD by
incorporating a novel semi-supervised hierarchical clustering loss. We evaluate
HGCD-BT on OpenSRH, a dataset of stimulated Raman histology brain tumor images,
achieving a +28% improvement in accuracy over state-of-the-art GCD methods for
patch-level classification, particularly in identifying previously unseen tumor
categories. Furthermore, we demonstrate the generalizability of HGCD-BT on
slide-level classification of hematoxylin and eosin stained whole-slide images
from the Digital Brain Tumor Atlas, confirming its utility across imaging
modalities.

TL;DR: AdaRD-Key是一个无需训练的关键帧采样模块，通过最大化统一的相关性-多样性目标，为长视频理解提供信息丰富且非冗余的帧选择。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型依赖均匀采样或具有严格时间间距的关键帧选择方法，这些方法常常忽略关键时刻或错过细粒度线索，导致对查询的错误响应。

Method: 提出AdaRD-Key模块，结合查询条件相关性得分和对数行列式多样性组件，最大化相关性-多样性最大体积目标，并使用轻量级相关性感知门控机制处理弱对齐查询。

Result: 在LongVideoBench和Video-MME上的广泛实验展示了最先进的性能，特别是在长视频上，且计算效率高（在单个GPU上实时运行）。

Conclusion: AdaRD-Key是一个无需训练、计算高效且与现有视觉语言模型兼容的即插即用解决方案，显著提升了长视频理解能力。

Abstract: Understanding long-form videos remains a significant challenge for
vision--language models (VLMs) due to their extensive temporal length and high
information density. Most current multimodal large language models (MLLMs) rely
on uniform sampling, which often overlooks critical moments, leading to
incorrect responses to queries. In parallel, many keyframe selection approaches
impose rigid temporal spacing: once a frame is chosen, an exclusion window
suppresses adjacent timestamps to reduce redundancy. While effective at
limiting overlap, this strategy frequently misses short, fine-grained cues near
important events. Other methods instead emphasize visual diversity but neglect
query relevance. We propose AdaRD-Key, a training-free keyframe sampling module
for query-driven long-form video understanding. AdaRD-Key maximizes a unified
Relevance--Diversity Max-Volume (RD-MV) objective, combining a
query-conditioned relevance score with a log-determinant diversity component to
yield informative yet non-redundant frames. To handle broad queries with weak
alignment to the video, AdaRD-Key employs a lightweight relevance-aware gating
mechanism; when the relevance distribution indicates weak alignment, the method
seamlessly shifts into a diversity-only mode, enhancing coverage without
additional supervision. Our pipeline is training-free, computationally
efficient (running in real time on a single GPU), and compatible with existing
VLMs in a plug-and-play manner. Extensive experiments on LongVideoBench and
Video-MME demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, particularly on long-form
videos. Code available at https://github.com/Xian867/AdaRD-Key.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在多模态任务中表现出色，但其在复杂横向思维挑战（如字谜游戏）中的认知过程和失败模式仍不明确，需要深入探索。

Method: 构建了包含221个字谜的系统标注数据集，涵盖六个认知类别，并开发了将推理质量与答案正确性分离的评估框架，研究了三种提示策略以揭示不同的解释过程。

Result: 研究发现推理质量在不同谜题类别中差异显著，模型在视觉组合方面表现出系统性优势，但在缺失解释和文化象征方面存在根本性局限；提示策略显著影响认知方法和问题解决效果。

Conclusion: 可解释性是模型性能的组成部分而非事后考虑，提示策略对认知过程和问题解决效果具有重要影响。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at many multimodal tasks, yet their
cognitive processes remain opaque on complex lateral thinking challenges like
rebus puzzles. While recent work has demonstrated these models struggle
significantly with rebus puzzle solving, the underlying reasoning processes and
failure patterns remain largely unexplored. We address this gap through a
comprehensive explainability analysis that moves beyond performance metrics to
understand how VLMs approach these complex lateral thinking challenges. Our
study contributes a systematically annotated dataset of 221 rebus puzzles
across six cognitive categories, paired with an evaluation framework that
separates reasoning quality from answer correctness. We investigate three
prompting strategies designed to elicit different types of explanatory
processes and reveal critical insights into VLM cognitive processes. Our
findings demonstrate that reasoning quality varies dramatically across puzzle
categories, with models showing systematic strengths in visual composition
while exhibiting fundamental limitations in absence interpretation and cultural
symbolism. We also discover that prompting strategy substantially influences
both cognitive approach and problem-solving effectiveness, establishing
explainability as an integral component of model performance rather than a
post-hoc consideration.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本移除研究主要关注自然图像中的场景文本，但当前数据集存在地面真值人工编辑伪影、文本背景过于简单、评估指标无法捕捉生成结果质量等问题，限制了跨域泛化能力。

Method: 通过对象感知放置和视觉语言模型生成内容，在复杂背景上渲染文本，构建具有干净地面真值和具有挑战性的文本移除场景的数据集。

Result: 创建了一个新的文本移除基准数据集，适用于场景文本以外的领域，数据集已在HuggingFace平台公开。

Conclusion: 提出的数据集解决了现有基准的局限性，为文本移除任务提供了更准确和具有挑战性的评估环境。

Abstract: Text removal is a crucial task in computer vision with applications such as
privacy preservation, image editing, and media reuse. While existing research
has primarily focused on scene text removal in natural images, limitations in
current datasets hinder out-of-domain generalization or accurate evaluation. In
particular, widely used benchmarks such as SCUT-EnsText suffer from ground
truth artifacts due to manual editing, overly simplistic text backgrounds, and
evaluation metrics that do not capture the quality of generated results. To
address these issues, we introduce an approach to synthesizing a text removal
benchmark applicable to domains other than scene texts. Our dataset features
text rendered on complex backgrounds using object-aware placement and
vision-language model-generated content, ensuring clean ground truth and
challenging text removal scenarios. The dataset is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种简单、检测器无关的框架，通过模态上下文注意力和查询表示对齐来解决医学多模态目标检测中的表示空间不一致问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学目标检测在单一检测器上训练混合医学模态（如CXR、CT、MRI）时，由于异构统计和不相交的表示空间而性能下降。

Method: 定义模态标记作为紧凑的文本派生嵌入，通过多模态上下文注意力（MoCA）将模态上下文注入对象查询，并使用QueryREPA预训练阶段通过对比目标对齐查询表示。

Result: 该方法在多种模态联合训练时持续提高AP，具有最小开销且无需架构修改。

Conclusion: 为稳健的多模态医学目标检测提供了一条实用路径。

Abstract: Medical object detection suffers when a single detector is trained on mixed
medical modalities (e.g., CXR, CT, MRI) due to heterogeneous statistics and
disjoint representation spaces. To address this challenge, we turn to
representation alignment, an approach that has proven effective for bringing
features from different sources into a shared space. Specifically, we target
the representations of DETR-style object queries and propose a simple,
detector-agnostic framework to align them with modality context. First, we
define modality tokens: compact, text-derived embeddings encoding imaging
modality that are lightweight and require no extra annotations. We integrate
the modality tokens into the detection process via Multimodality Context
Attention (MoCA), mixing object-query representations via self-attention to
propagate modality context within the query set. This preserves DETR-style
architectures and adds negligible latency while injecting modality cues into
object queries. We further introduce QueryREPA, a short pretraining stage that
aligns query representations to their modality tokens using a task-specific
contrastive objective with modality-balanced batches. Together, MoCA and
QueryREPA produce modality-aware, class-faithful queries that transfer
effectively to downstream training. Across diverse modalities trained
altogether, the proposed approach consistently improves AP with minimal
overhead and no architectural modifications, offering a practical path toward
robust multimodality medical object detection. Project page:

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为MaskCD的新方法，通过掩码LVLMs中的"图像头"来构建对比样本，用于对比解码，有效缓解大型视觉语言模型的幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在视觉语言理解方面表现出色，但存在幻觉问题，即生成与输入视觉和文本内容相矛盾的内容。现有的对比解码方法难以构建合适的对比样本，而注意力操作方法缺乏稳定性。

Method: 提出图像头掩码对比解码(MaskCD)，利用LVLMs中的"图像头"，通过掩码这些头来构建对比样本进行对比解码。

Result: 在LLaVA-1.5-7b和Qwen-VL-7b模型上评估，使用CHAIR、POPE、AMBER和MME等基准测试，结果显示MaskCD有效缓解幻觉现象并保留LVLMs的通用能力。

Conclusion: MaskCD方法能够有效解决LVLMs的幻觉问题，同时保持模型的通用能力，为处理多模态任务中的幻觉问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have shown remarkable performance in
visual-language understanding for downstream multimodal tasks. While their
capabilities are improving, problems emerge simultaneously. Among those
problems, the hallucinations have attracted much attention, which stands for
the phenomenon where LVLMs generate contradictory content to their input visual
and text contents. Many approaches have been proposed to deal with this issue,
such as contrastive decoding and attention manipulation. However, contrastive
decoding methods struggle in constructing appropriate contrastive samples, and
attention manipulation methods are highly sensitive, lacking stability. In this
work, we propose image head Masked Contrastive Decoding (MaskCD). Our approach
utilizes the "image heads" in LVLMs, masking them to construct contrastive
samples for contrastive decoding. We evaluated MaskCD on LLaVA-1.5-7b and
Qwen-VL-7b, using various benchmarks such as CHAIR, POPE, AMBER and MME. The
results demonstrate that MaskCD effectively alleviates the phenomenon of
hallucinations and retains the general capabilities of LVLMs. Corresponding

Conclusion: VERNIER为显微镜应用提供了可靠的位姿测量解决方案，并给出了选择合适模式设计和显微镜放大镜头的指导原则。

Abstract: Pose estimation is still a challenge at the small scales. Few solutions exist
to capture the 6 degrees of freedom of an object with nanometric and
microradians resolutions over relatively large ranges. Over the years, we have
proposed several fiducial marker and pattern designs to achieve reliable
performance for various microscopy applications. Centimeter ranges are possible
using pattern encoding methods, while nanometer resolutions can be achieved
using phase processing of the periodic frames. This paper presents VERNIER, an
open source phase processing software designed to provide fast and reliable
pose measurement based on pseudo-periodic patterns. Thanks to a phase-based
local thresholding algorithm, the software has proven to be particularly robust
to noise, defocus and occlusion. The successive steps of the phase processing
are presented, as well as the different types of patterns that address
different application needs. The implementation procedure is illustrated with
synthetic and experimental images. Finally, guidelines are given for selecting
the appropriate pattern design and microscope magnification lenses as a
function of the desired performance.

Motivation: 临床诊断需要灵活重建缺失的成像模态，但面临三个挑战：不同模态对目标任务的异质贡献建模、防止噪声信息导致退化的融合质量控制、多输出生成中的模态身份一致性保持。

Method: 将多模态医学数据视为带质量驱动选择机制的序列帧，设计了三个协作模块：PreWeightNet（全局贡献评估）、ThresholdNet（自适应过滤）、EffiWeightNet（有效权重计算），以及用于保持模态身份一致性的因果模态身份模块（CMIM）。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，Med-K2N显著优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 通过渐进增强和选择性融合机制，Med-K2N能够有效解决K到N医学图像合成中的关键挑战，为临床诊断提供可靠支持。

Abstract: Cross-modal medical image synthesis research focuses on reconstructing
missing imaging modalities from available ones to support clinical diagnosis.
Driven by clinical necessities for flexible modality reconstruction, we explore
K to N medical generation, where three critical challenges emerge: How can we
model the heterogeneous contributions of different modalities to various target
tasks? How can we ensure fusion quality control to prevent degradation from
noisy information? How can we maintain modality identity consistency in
multi-output generation? Driven by these clinical necessities, and drawing
inspiration from SAM2's sequential frame paradigm and clinicians' progressive
workflow of incrementally adding and selectively integrating multi-modal
information, we treat multi-modal medical data as sequential frames with
quality-driven selection mechanisms. Our key idea is to "learn" adaptive
weights for each modality-task pair and "memorize" beneficial fusion patterns
through progressive enhancement. To achieve this, we design three collaborative
modules: PreWeightNet for global contribution assessment, ThresholdNet for
adaptive filtering, and EffiWeightNet for effective weight computation.
Meanwhile, to maintain modality identity consistency, we propose the Causal
Modality Identity Module (CMIM) that establishes causal constraints between
generated images and target modality descriptions using vision-language
modeling. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed Med-K2N
outperforms state-of-the-art methods by significant margins on multiple
benchmarks. Source code is available.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 需要准确、无损的鸡蛋质量评估方法来确保食品安全、维持产品标准和提高商业家禽生产效率。传统方法需要破坏性内部测量，而本研究旨在仅使用外部特征进行内部质量评估。

Method: 使用预训练的CNN模型（ResNet152、DenseNet169和ResNet152V2）提取鸡蛋外部图像特征，结合形状和重量特征，通过PCA降维、SMOTE增强和多种机器学习算法分类，最后采用集成投票机制结合最佳分类器的预测结果。

Conclusion: ELMF4EggQ证明了仅使用外部非侵入性特征就能有效评估鸡蛋内部质量的可行性，为食品行业提供了实用的无损检测解决方案，并公开了代码和数据集以促进该领域研究。

Abstract: Accurate, non-destructive assessment of egg quality is critical for ensuring
food safety, maintaining product standards, and operational efficiency in
commercial poultry production. This paper introduces ELMF4EggQ, an ensemble
learning framework that employs multimodal feature fusion to classify egg grade
and freshness using only external attributes - image, shape, and weight. A
novel, publicly available dataset of 186 brown-shelled eggs was constructed,
with egg grade and freshness levels determined through laboratory-based expert
assessments involving internal quality measurements, such as yolk index and
Haugh unit. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to apply
machine learning methods for internal egg quality assessment using only
external, non-invasive features, and the first to release a corresponding
labeled dataset. The proposed framework integrates deep features extracted from
external egg images with structural characteristics such as egg shape and
weight, enabling a comprehensive representation of each egg. Image feature
extraction is performed using top-performing pre-trained CNN models (ResNet152,
DenseNet169, and ResNet152V2), followed by PCA-based dimensionality reduction,
SMOTE augmentation, and classification using multiple machine learning
algorithms. An ensemble voting mechanism combines predictions from the
best-performing classifiers to enhance overall accuracy. Experimental results
demonstrate that the multimodal approach significantly outperforms image-only
and tabular (shape and weight) only baselines, with the multimodal ensemble
approach achieving 86.57% accuracy in grade classification and 70.83% in
freshness prediction. All code and data are publicly available at

Conclusion: 补丁级语义表示对于可扩展的描述生成非常有效，在密集描述、区域集描述和轨迹描述任务中表现优异

Abstract: Zero-shot captioners are recently proposed models that utilize common-space
vision-language representations to caption images without relying on paired
image-text data. To caption an image, they proceed by textually decoding a
text-aligned image feature, but they limit their scope to global
representations and whole-image captions. We present \frameworkName{}, a
unified framework for zero-shot captioning that shifts from an image-centric to
a patch-centric paradigm, enabling the captioning of arbitrary regions without
the need of region-level supervision. Instead of relying on global image
representations, we treat individual patches as atomic captioning units and
aggregate them to describe arbitrary regions, from single patches to
non-contiguous areas and entire images. We analyze the key ingredients that
enable current latent captioners to work in our novel proposed framework.
Experiments demonstrate that backbones producing meaningful, dense visual
features, such as DINO, are key to achieving state-of-the-art performance in
multiple region-based captioning tasks. Compared to other baselines and

*Laith Nayal,Hadi Salloum,Ahmad Taha,Yaroslav Kholodov,Alexander Gasnikov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练的OoD检测方法，利用InternImage骨干网络特征，结合K-Means聚类和置信度阈值，在语义分割中识别未知物体，在多个基准测试中超越有监督和无监督基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语义分割中的未知物体检测对自动驾驶等安全关键应用至关重要。虽然大型视觉基础模型在闭集语义任务中表现出色，但它们在检测语义分割中的分布外区域的能力尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 提出简单的无需训练方法：使用InternImage骨干网络提取特征，应用K-Means聚类结合解码器原始logits的置信度阈值来识别OoD聚类。

Result: 在RoadAnomaly基准测试上达到50.02平均精度，在ADE-OoD基准测试上达到48.77平均精度，使用InternImage-L模型，超越了多个有监督和无监督基线方法。

Conclusion: 结果表明这是一种有前景的通用OoD分割方法方向，需要最少的假设或额外数据。

Abstract: Detecting unknown objects in semantic segmentation is crucial for
safety-critical applications such as autonomous driving. Large vision
foundation models, including DINOv2, InternImage, and CLIP, have advanced
visual representation learning by providing rich features that generalize well
across diverse tasks. While their strength in closed-set semantic tasks is
established, their capability to detect out-of-distribution (OoD) regions in
semantic segmentation remains underexplored. In this work, we investigate
whether foundation models fine-tuned on segmentation datasets can inherently
distinguish in-distribution (ID) from OoD regions without any outlier
supervision. We propose a simple, training-free approach that utilizes features
from the InternImage backbone and applies K-Means clustering alongside
confidence thresholding on raw decoder logits to identify OoD clusters. Our
method achieves 50.02 Average Precision on the RoadAnomaly benchmark and 48.77
on the benchmark of ADE-OoD with InternImage-L, surpassing several supervised
and unsupervised baselines. These results suggest a promising direction for
generic OoD segmentation methods that require minimal assumptions or additional
data.

*Xin Zou,Di Lu,Yizhou Wang,Yibo Yan,Yuanhuiyi Lyu,Xu Zheng,Linfeng Zhang,Xuming Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HoloV是一个简单有效的视觉token剪枝框架，通过从全局视角自适应分配剪枝预算，避免传统基于注意力的方法在高剪枝率下性能下降的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型依赖大量视觉token导致计算开销巨大，现有基于注意力机制的剪枝方法在高剪枝率下会保留语义相似的token，造成性能显著下降。

Method: 提出HoloV框架，从整体视角重新思考token保留策略，通过在不同空间裁剪区域自适应分配剪枝预算，确保保留的token能捕捉全局视觉上下文而非孤立显著特征。

Result: 在各种任务、MLLM架构和剪枝率下均优于现有方法，LLaVA1.5使用HoloV在剪枝88.9%视觉token后仍能保持95.8%的原始性能。

Conclusion: HoloV通过全局视角的token剪枝策略，在保持高效推理的同时最小化了表征崩溃，实现了优越的效率-精度权衡。

Abstract: Despite their powerful capabilities, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)
suffer from considerable computational overhead due to their reliance on
massive visual tokens. Recent studies have explored token pruning to alleviate
this problem, which typically uses text-vision cross-attention or
[\texttt{CLS}] attention to assess and discard redundant visual tokens. In this
work, we identify a critical limitation of such attention-first pruning
approaches, i.e., they tend to preserve semantically similar tokens, resulting
in pronounced performance drops under high pruning ratios. To this end, we
propose {HoloV}, a simple yet effective, plug-and-play visual token pruning
framework for efficient inference. Distinct from previous attention-first
schemes, HoloV rethinks token retention from a holistic perspective. By
adaptively distributing the pruning budget across different spatial crops,
HoloV ensures that the retained tokens capture the global visual context rather
than isolated salient features. This strategy minimizes representational
collapse and maintains task-relevant information even under aggressive pruning.
Experimental results demonstrate that our HoloV achieves superior performance
across various tasks, MLLM architectures, and pruning ratios compared to SOTA
methods. For instance, LLaVA1.5 equipped with HoloV preserves 95.8\% of the
original performance after pruning 88.9\% of visual tokens, achieving superior
efficiency-accuracy trade-offs.

*Nikoo Naghavian,Mostafa Tavassolipour*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Confidence-Aware Weighting (CAW)方法增强视觉语言模型的零样本鲁棒性，包含置信度感知损失和特征对齐正则化，在多个数据集上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型如CLIP在零样本泛化方面表现优异，但对对抗攻击非常脆弱，需要提升其鲁棒性。

Method: CAW包含两个组件：(1) 置信度感知损失，通过缩放干净和对抗预测之间的KL散度来优先处理不确定的对抗样本；(2) 特征对齐正则化，通过最小化冻结和微调图像编码器在对抗输入上的特征距离来保持语义一致性。

Result: 在TinyImageNet和14个额外数据集上的广泛实验表明，CAW在AutoAttack等强攻击下优于PMG-AFT和TGA-ZSR等最新方法，且内存使用更少。

Conclusion: CAW能同时提升干净和鲁棒准确率，且不牺牲泛化能力，为视觉语言模型的零样本鲁棒性提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-language models like CLIP demonstrate impressive zero-shot
generalization but remain highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks. In this
work, we propose Confidence-Aware Weighting (CAW) to enhance zero-shot
robustness in vision-language models. CAW consists of two components: (1) a
Confidence-Aware loss that prioritizes uncertain adversarial examples by
scaling the KL divergence between clean and adversarial predictions, and (2) a
feature alignment regularization that preserves semantic consistency by
minimizing the distance between frozen and fine-tuned image encoder features on
adversarial inputs. These components work jointly to improve both clean and
robust accuracy without sacrificing generalization. Extensive experiments on
TinyImageNet and 14 additional datasets show that CAW outperforms recent
methods such as PMG-AFT and TGA-ZSR under strong attacks like AutoAttack, while
using less memory.

TL;DR: 该研究评估了大型视觉语言模型在整合超声成像与临床数据用于颈动脉粥样硬化风险评估的潜力，发现现有模型在风险分类方面表现不佳，但通过领域适应和多模态数据整合可显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 颈动脉粥样硬化疾病的风险评估需要整合多样化的临床和影像信息，但现有方法在透明度和可解释性方面存在不足，因此研究探索大型视觉语言模型在此领域的应用潜力。

Method: 提出模拟真实诊断场景的访谈式问题框架，比较多种开源LVLMs，包括通用模型和医学调优模型。使用低秩适应技术将LLaVa-NeXT-Vicuna模型适配到超声领域，并整合多模态表格数据。

Result: 零样本实验显示现有LVLMs在识别成像模态和解剖结构方面表现不一，但在风险分类方面普遍较差。领域适应后模型在卒中风险分层方面有显著改进，多模态数据整合进一步提高了特异性和平衡准确率，性能可与传统CNN基线相媲美。

Conclusion: LVLMs在超声心血管风险预测中既有潜力也有局限，强调多模态整合、模型校准和领域适应对临床转化的重要性。

Abstract: Reliable risk assessment for carotid atheromatous disease remains a major
clinical challenge, as it requires integrating diverse clinical and imaging
information in a manner that is transparent and interpretable to clinicians.
This study investigates the potential of state-of-the-art and recent large
vision-language models (LVLMs) for multimodal carotid plaque assessment by
integrating ultrasound imaging (USI) with structured clinical, demographic,
laboratory, and protein biomarker data. A framework that simulates realistic
diagnostic scenarios through interview-style question sequences is proposed,
comparing a range of open-source LVLMs, including both general-purpose and
medically tuned models. Zero-shot experiments reveal that even if they are very
powerful, not all LVLMs can accurately identify imaging modality and anatomy,
while all of them perform poorly in accurate risk classification. To address
this limitation, LLaVa-NeXT-Vicuna is adapted to the ultrasound domain using
low-rank adaptation (LoRA), resulting in substantial improvements in stroke
risk stratification. The integration of multimodal tabular data in the form of
text further enhances specificity and balanced accuracy, yielding competitive
performance compared to prior convolutional neural network (CNN) baselines
trained on the same dataset. Our findings highlight both the promise and
limitations of LVLMs in ultrasound-based cardiovascular risk prediction,
underscoring the importance of multimodal integration, model calibration, and
domain adaptation for clinical translation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多期增强MRI合成方法使用深度自编码器生成器参数效率低，且缺乏可解释的训练策略，需要改进特征分离能力。

Method: 使用Flip Distribution Alignment VAE，将输入和目标图像编码为关于标准正态分布对称的两个潜在分布，结合Y形双向训练策略增强特征分离的可解释性。

Result: 相比现有深度自编码器端到端合成方法，FDA-VAE显著减少模型参数和推理时间，同时有效提高合成质量。

Conclusion: FDA-VAE为多期增强MRI合成提供了一种轻量级且可解释的特征解耦解决方案，在参数效率和合成质量方面均有显著改进。

Abstract: Separating shared and independent features is crucial for multi-phase
contrast-enhanced (CE) MRI synthesis. However, existing methods use deep
autoencoder generators with low parameter efficiency and lack interpretable
training strategies. In this paper, we propose Flip Distribution Alignment
Variational Autoencoder (FDA-VAE), a lightweight feature-decoupled VAE model
for multi-phase CE MRI synthesis. Our method encodes input and target images
into two latent distributions that are symmetric concerning a standard normal
distribution, effectively separating shared and independent features. The
Y-shaped bidirectional training strategy further enhances the interpretability
of feature separation. Experimental results show that compared to existing deep
autoencoder-based end-to-end synthesis methods, FDA-VAE significantly reduces
model parameters and inference time while effectively improving synthesis
quality. The source code is publicly available at

TL;DR: 提出了LPG-Bench基准测试和TIT评估方法，用于解决大模型在长文本提示图像生成中的对齐问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像模型在处理长而详细的提示时表现不一致，缺乏有效的评估基准和指标。

Method: 构建包含200个平均长度超250词提示的LPG-Bench基准，并提出基于文本-图像-文本一致性的TIT评估方法，包括TIT-Score和TIT-Score-LLM两种实现。

Result: TIT方法在人类偏好对齐方面显著优于现有指标，TIT-Score-LLM在成对准确率上比最强基线提升7.31%。

Conclusion: LPG-Bench和TIT方法为T2I模型的基准测试和发展提供了新视角，所有资源将公开。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large multimodal models (LMMs), recent
text-to-image (T2I) models can generate high-quality images and demonstrate
great alignment to short prompts. However, they still struggle to effectively
understand and follow long and detailed prompts, displaying inconsistent
generation. To address this challenge, we introduce LPG-Bench, a comprehensive
benchmark for evaluating long-prompt-based text-to-image generation. LPG-Bench
features 200 meticulously crafted prompts with an average length of over 250
words, approaching the input capacity of several leading commercial models.
Using these prompts, we generate 2,600 images from 13 state-of-the-art models
and further perform comprehensive human-ranked annotations. Based on LPG-Bench,
we observe that state-of-the-art T2I alignment evaluation metrics exhibit poor
consistency with human preferences on long-prompt-based image generation. To
address the gap, we introduce a novel zero-shot metric based on
text-to-image-to-text consistency, termed TIT, for evaluating
long-prompt-generated images. The core concept of TIT is to quantify T2I
alignment by directly comparing the consistency between the raw prompt and the
LMM-produced description on the generated image, which includes an efficient
score-based instantiation TIT-Score and a large-language-model (LLM) based
instantiation TIT-Score-LLM. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
framework achieves superior alignment with human judgment compared to
CLIP-score, LMM-score, etc., with TIT-Score-LLM attaining a 7.31% absolute
improvement in pairwise accuracy over the strongest baseline. LPG-Bench and TIT
methods together offer a deeper perspective to benchmark and foster the
development of T2I models. All resources will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: 提出了3DEditVerse数据集和3DEditFormer模型，通过大规模配对数据和结构保持的transformer架构，解决了3D编辑中的跨视图一致性、结构保真度和细粒度控制问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D编辑方法存在速度慢、几何失真、依赖手动3D掩码等问题，需要开发更实用和可扩展的解决方案。

Method: 构建了116,309个高质量训练对的3DEditVerse数据集，并提出3DEditFormer模型，采用双引导注意力和时间自适应门控机制来保持3D结构。

Result: 在广泛实验中，该框架在定量和定性评估上都优于现有最先进方法，无需辅助3D掩码即可实现精确一致编辑。

Conclusion: 为实用和可扩展的3D编辑建立了新标准，数据集和代码将开源发布。

Abstract: 3D editing - the task of locally modifying the geometry or appearance of a 3D
asset - has wide applications in immersive content creation, digital
entertainment, and AR/VR. However, unlike 2D editing, it remains challenging
due to the need for cross-view consistency, structural fidelity, and
fine-grained controllability. Existing approaches are often slow, prone to
geometric distortions, or dependent on manual and accurate 3D masks that are
error-prone and impractical. To address these challenges, we advance both the
data and model fronts. On the data side, we introduce 3DEditVerse, the largest
paired 3D editing benchmark to date, comprising 116,309 high-quality training
pairs and 1,500 curated test pairs. Built through complementary pipelines of
pose-driven geometric edits and foundation model-guided appearance edits,
3DEditVerse ensures edit locality, multi-view consistency, and semantic
alignment. On the model side, we propose 3DEditFormer, a
3D-structure-preserving conditional transformer. By enhancing image-to-3D
generation with dual-guidance attention and time-adaptive gating, 3DEditFormer
disentangles editable regions from preserved structure, enabling precise and
consistent edits without requiring auxiliary 3D masks. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art baselines both
quantitatively and qualitatively, establishing a new standard for practical and
scalable 3D editing. Dataset and code will be released. Project:

TL;DR: 提出了一种云层注入算法模拟真实云覆盖，测试Sentinel-1雷达数据如何填补云遮挡造成的光学图像空白，并通过在解码层注入归一化差异指数来保留空间特征，提升土地覆盖分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Sentinel-2数据集多为无云图像，在云层常见的热带地区实用性有限，需要解决云遮挡问题和深度网络中编码器下采样导致的空间/光谱细节丢失问题。

Method: 开发云层注入算法模拟真实云覆盖；提出轻量级方法在最终解码层注入归一化差异指数(NDIs)来保留关键空间特征；结合Sentinel-1雷达数据与光学数据进行融合。

Result: 在DFC2020数据集上，注入NDIs使U-Net性能提升1.99%，DeepLabV3提升2.78%；在云覆盖条件下，结合Sentinel-1数据相比仅使用光学数据在所有模型中都带来显著性能提升。

Conclusion: 雷达-光学融合在具有挑战性的大气场景中非常有效，提出的方法能够显著提升土地覆盖语义分割性能，特别是在云层覆盖条件下。

Abstract: Supervised deep learning for land cover semantic segmentation (LCS) relies on
labeled satellite data. However, most existing Sentinel-2 datasets are
cloud-free, which limits their usefulness in tropical regions where clouds are
common. To properly evaluate the extent of this problem, we developed a cloud
injection algorithm that simulates realistic cloud cover, allowing us to test
how Sentinel-1 radar data can fill in the gaps caused by cloud-obstructed
optical imagery. We also tackle the issue of losing spatial and/or spectral
details during encoder downsampling in deep networks. To mitigate this loss, we
propose a lightweight method that injects Normalized Difference Indices (NDIs)
into the final decoding layers, enabling the model to retain key spatial
features with minimal additional computation. Injecting NDIs enhanced land
cover segmentation performance on the DFC2020 dataset, yielding improvements of
1.99% for U-Net and 2.78% for DeepLabV3 on cloud-free imagery. Under
cloud-covered conditions, incorporating Sentinel-1 data led to significant
performance gains across all models compared to using optical data alone,
highlighting the effectiveness of radar-optical fusion in challenging
atmospheric scenarios.

Abstract: Real-world image super-resolution (RealSR) aims to enhance the visual quality
of in-the-wild images, such as those captured by mobile phones. While existing
methods leveraging large generative models demonstrate impressive results, the
high computational cost and latency make them impractical for edge deployment.
In this paper, we introduce PocketSR, an ultra-lightweight, single-step model
that brings generative modeling capabilities to RealSR while maintaining high
fidelity. To achieve this, we design LiteED, a highly efficient alternative to
the original computationally intensive VAE in SD, reducing parameters by 97.5%
while preserving high-quality encoding and decoding. Additionally, we propose
online annealing pruning for the U-Net, which progressively shifts generative
priors from heavy modules to lightweight counterparts, ensuring effective
knowledge transfer and further optimizing efficiency. To mitigate the loss of
prior knowledge during pruning, we incorporate a multi-layer feature
distillation loss. Through an in-depth analysis of each design component, we
provide valuable insights for future research. PocketSR, with a model size of
146M parameters, processes 4K images in just 0.8 seconds, achieving a
remarkable speedup over previous methods. Notably, it delivers performance on
par with state-of-the-art single-step and even multi-step RealSR models, making
it a highly practical solution for edge-device applications.

Abstract: Text-to-video (T2V) generation has surged in response to challenging
questions, especially when a long video must depict multiple sequential events
with temporal coherence and controllable content. Existing methods that extend
to multi-event generation omit an inspection of the intrinsic factor in event
shifting. The paper aims to answer the central question: When and where
multi-event prompts control event transition during T2V generation. This work
introduces MEve, a self-curated prompt suite for evaluating multi-event
text-to-video (T2V) generation, and conducts a systematic study of two
representative model families, i.e., OpenSora and CogVideoX. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the importance of early intervention in denoising steps

Abstract: Facial Emotion Recognition (FER) is a key task in affective computing,
enabling applications in human-computer interaction, e-learning, healthcare,
and safety systems. Despite advances in deep learning, FER remains challenging
due to occlusions, illumination and pose variations, subtle intra-class
differences, and dataset imbalance that hinders recognition of minority
emotions. We present InsideOut, a reproducible FER framework built on
EfficientNetV2-S with transfer learning, strong data augmentation, and
imbalance-aware optimization. The approach standardizes FER2013 images, applies
stratified splitting and augmentation, and fine-tunes a lightweight
classification head with class-weighted loss to address skewed distributions.
InsideOut achieves 62.8% accuracy with a macro averaged F1 of 0.590 on FER2013,
showing competitive results compared to conventional CNN baselines. The novelty
lies in demonstrating that efficient architectures, combined with tailored
imbalance handling, can provide practical, transparent, and reproducible FER
solutions.

Abstract: Semantic distillation in radiance fields has spurred significant advances in
open-vocabulary robot policies, e.g., in manipulation and navigation, founded
on pretrained semantics from large vision models. While prior work has
demonstrated the effectiveness of visual-only semantic features (e.g., DINO and
CLIP) in Gaussian Splatting and neural radiance fields, the potential benefit
of geometry-grounding in distilled fields remains an open question. In
principle, visual-geometry features seem very promising for spatial tasks such
as pose estimation, prompting the question: Do geometry-grounded semantic
features offer an edge in distilled fields? Specifically, we ask three critical
questions: First, does spatial-grounding produce higher-fidelity geometry-aware
semantic features? We find that image features from geometry-grounded backbones
contain finer structural details compared to their counterparts. Secondly, does
geometry-grounding improve semantic object localization? We observe no
significant difference in this task. Thirdly, does geometry-grounding enable
higher-accuracy radiance field inversion? Given the limitations of prior work
and their lack of semantics integration, we propose a novel framework SPINE for
inverting radiance fields without an initial guess, consisting of two core
components: coarse inversion using distilled semantics, and fine inversion
using photometric-based optimization. Surprisingly, we find that the pose
estimation accuracy decreases with geometry-grounded features. Our results
suggest that visual-only features offer greater versatility for a broader range
of downstream tasks, although geometry-grounded features contain more geometric
detail. Notably, our findings underscore the necessity of future research on
effective strategies for geometry-grounding that augment the versatility and
performance of pretrained semantic features.

Result: 识别出两个关键因素：(i)训练目标的离散/连续分布特性，(ii)条件信息在训练期间提供概念构成信息的程度。基于这些发现，证明了辅助连续JEPA目标可以改进离散模型的组合性能。

Conclusion: 训练目标的分布特性和条件信息的提供方式是影响组合泛化的重要因素，通过适当结合离散和连续目标可以提升模型的组合泛化能力。

Abstract: Compositional generalization, the ability to generate novel combinations of
known concepts, is a key ingredient for visual generative models. Yet, not all
mechanisms that enable or inhibit it are fully understood. In this work, we
conduct a systematic study of how various design choices influence
compositional generalization in image and video generation in a positive or
negative way. Through controlled experiments, we identify two key factors: (i)
whether the training objective operates on a discrete or continuous
distribution, and (ii) to what extent conditioning provides information about
the constituent concepts during training. Building on these insights, we show
that relaxing the MaskGIT discrete loss with an auxiliary continuous JEPA-based
objective can improve compositional performance in discrete models like
MaskGIT.

TL;DR: Mask2IV是一个用于交互中心视频生成的两阶段框架，无需密集掩码输入，通过预测运动轨迹来生成高质量交互视频。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以建模复杂的动态交互，且密集精确的掩码标注在现实应用中获取困难。

Method: 采用解耦的两阶段流程：先预测执行者和对象的运动轨迹，然后基于这些轨迹生成视频。支持通过动作描述或空间位置线索来引导运动轨迹。

Result: 在两个涵盖人-物交互和机器人操作场景的基准测试中，该方法在视觉真实性和可控性方面优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: Mask2IV框架有效解决了交互中心视频生成的挑战，提供了灵活的控制方式，无需密集掩码输入即可生成高质量交互视频。

Abstract: Generating interaction-centric videos, such as those depicting humans or
robots interacting with objects, is crucial for embodied intelligence, as they
provide rich and diverse visual priors for robot learning, manipulation policy
training, and affordance reasoning. However, existing methods often struggle to
model such complex and dynamic interactions. While recent studies show that
masks can serve as effective control signals and enhance generation quality,
obtaining dense and precise mask annotations remains a major challenge for
real-world use. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Mask2IV, a novel
framework specifically designed for interaction-centric video generation. It
adopts a decoupled two-stage pipeline that first predicts plausible motion
trajectories for both actor and object, then generates a video conditioned on
these trajectories. This design eliminates the need for dense mask inputs from
users while preserving the flexibility to manipulate the interaction process.
Furthermore, Mask2IV supports versatile and intuitive control, allowing users
to specify the target object of interaction and guide the motion trajectory
through action descriptions or spatial position cues. To support systematic
training and evaluation, we curate two benchmarks covering diverse action and
object categories across both human-object interaction and robotic manipulation
scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior
visual realism and controllability compared to existing baselines.

*Naresh Kumar Devulapally,Shruti Agarwal,Tejas Gokhale,Vishnu Suresh Lokhande*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于扩散模型潜在空间的图像扰动方法，通过改变去噪轨迹的起点来生成不可学习的训练样本，保护数据隐私和防止未经授权的模型个性化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本到图像扩散模型在个性化方面表现出色，但引发了数据隐私、知识产权保护和未经授权使用的担忧。现有方法在像素空间操作导致图像存在噪声和伪影，视觉保真度有限。

Method: 在扩散模型的潜在空间中操作，交替进行去噪和反转过程，同时修改去噪轨迹的起点。这种轨迹偏移采样确保扰动图像保持高视觉保真度，同时对下游生成模型的反转和个性化具有抵抗力。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上验证了方法对最先进反转攻击的鲁棒性。在感知指标（PSNR、SSIM、FID）上提升约8%-10%，在五种对抗设置下平均鲁棒性提升约10%。

Conclusion: 该方法将不可学习性集成到潜在扩散模型框架中，提供了一种实用且不易察觉的防御机制，有效保护敏感数据免受未经授权的模型适应。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in
rapid and high-fidelity personalization, even when provided with only a few
user images. However, the effectiveness of personalization techniques has lead
to concerns regarding data privacy, intellectual property protection, and
unauthorized usage. To mitigate such unauthorized usage and model replication,
the idea of generating ``unlearnable'' training samples utilizing image
poisoning techniques has emerged. Existing methods for this have limited
imperceptibility as they operate in the pixel space which results in images
with noise and artifacts. In this work, we propose a novel model-based
perturbation strategy that operates within the latent space of diffusion
models. Our method alternates between denoising and inversion while modifying
the starting point of the denoising trajectory: of diffusion models. This
trajectory-shifted sampling ensures that the perturbed images maintain high
visual fidelity to the original inputs while being resistant to inversion and
personalization by downstream generative models. This approach integrates
unlearnability into the framework of Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs), enabling a
practical and imperceptible defense against unauthorized model adaptation. We
validate our approach on four benchmark datasets to demonstrate robustness
against state-of-the-art inversion attacks. Results demonstrate that our method
achieves significant improvements in imperceptibility ($\sim 8 \% -10\%$ on
perceptual metrics including PSNR, SSIM, and FID) and robustness ( $\sim 10\%$
on average across five adversarial settings), highlighting its effectiveness in
safeguarding sensitive data.

### [43] [GeoComplete: Geometry-Aware Diffusion for Reference-Driven Image Completion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03110)
*Beibei Lin,Tingting Chen,Robby T. Tan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GeoComplete是一个新颖的参考驱动图像补全框架，通过引入显式3D结构指导来增强几何一致性，显著优于现有仅依赖扩散先验的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成方法仅依赖扩散先验，缺乏几何线索（如相机位姿或深度），导致补全内容错位或不合理。当目标视图与参考图像差异较大时，这一问题尤为突出。

Method: 提出双分支扩散架构：一个分支从掩码目标合成缺失区域，另一个分支从投影点云提取几何特征。通过联合自注意力确保连贯准确的补全。引入目标感知掩码策略，在训练时掩码参考图像中的遮挡区域。

Result: 实验显示GeoComplete比最先进方法PSNR提升17.1，显著提高几何准确度同时保持高视觉质量。

Conclusion: 通过结合几何感知的双分支扩散架构和目标感知掩码策略，GeoComplete为几何条件图像补全提供了统一且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Reference-driven image completion, which restores missing regions in a target
view using additional images, is particularly challenging when the target view
differs significantly from the references. Existing generative methods rely
solely on diffusion priors and, without geometric cues such as camera pose or
depth, often produce misaligned or implausible content. We propose GeoComplete,
a novel framework that incorporates explicit 3D structural guidance to enforce
geometric consistency in the completed regions, setting it apart from prior
image-only approaches. GeoComplete introduces two key ideas: conditioning the
diffusion process on projected point clouds to infuse geometric information,
and applying target-aware masking to guide the model toward relevant reference
cues. The framework features a dual-branch diffusion architecture. One branch
synthesizes the missing regions from the masked target, while the other
extracts geometric features from the projected point cloud. Joint
self-attention across branches ensures coherent and accurate completion. To
address regions visible in references but absent in the target, we project the
target view into each reference to detect occluded areas, which are then masked
during training. This target-aware masking directs the model to focus on useful
cues, enhancing performance in difficult scenarios. By integrating a
geometry-aware dual-branch diffusion architecture with a target-aware masking
strategy, GeoComplete offers a unified and robust solution for
geometry-conditioned image completion. Experiments show that GeoComplete
achieves a 17.1 PSNR improvement over state-of-the-art methods, significantly
boosting geometric accuracy while maintaining high visual quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决文本到音视频生成中的两个关键挑战：(1)共享文本标题导致模态干扰，混淆预训练骨干网络；(2)跨模态特征交互机制不明确

Method: 提出分层视觉基础标题生成(HVGC)框架生成解耦的视频和音频标题，消除条件阶段的干扰；引入BridgeDiT双塔扩散变换器，采用双交叉注意力(DCA)机制实现双向信息交换

Result: 在三个基准数据集上的广泛实验和人工评估表明，该方法在大多数指标上达到最先进水平

Conclusion: 消融研究验证了所提方法的有效性，为未来T2SV任务提供了关键见解

Abstract: This study focuses on a challenging yet promising task,
Text-to-Sounding-Video (T2SV) generation, which aims to generate a video with
synchronized audio from text conditions, meanwhile ensuring both modalities are
aligned with text. Despite progress in joint audio-video training, two critical
challenges still remain unaddressed: (1) a single, shared text caption where
the text for video is equal to the text for audio often creates modal
interference, confusing the pretrained backbones, and (2) the optimal mechanism
for cross-modal feature interaction remains unclear. To address these
challenges, we first propose the Hierarchical Visual-Grounded Captioning (HVGC)
framework that generates pairs of disentangled captions, a video caption, and
an audio caption, eliminating interference at the conditioning stage. Based on
HVGC, we further introduce BridgeDiT, a novel dual-tower diffusion transformer,
which employs a Dual CrossAttention (DCA) mechanism that acts as a robust
``bridge" to enable a symmetric, bidirectional exchange of information,
achieving both semantic and temporal synchronization. Extensive experiments on
three benchmark datasets, supported by human evaluations, demonstrate that our
method achieves state-of-the-art results on most metrics. Comprehensive
ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of our contributions,
offering key insights for the future T2SV task. All the codes and checkpoints
will be publicly released.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HAVIR模型通过分离视觉皮层的两个层次区域提取不同特征，结合结构生成器和语义提取器，利用Versatile Diffusion模型合成图像，在复杂场景中提升了重建的结构和语义质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在恢复高度复杂视觉刺激方面仍面临挑战，主要因为自然场景中低层特征具有异质性，而高层特征因上下文重叠存在语义纠缠。

Method: 将视觉皮层分为两个层次区域：结构生成器从空间处理体素提取结构信息并转换为潜在扩散先验，语义提取器将语义处理体素转换为CLIP嵌入，通过Versatile Diffusion模型集成合成最终图像。

Result: 实验结果表明HAVIR在复杂场景中提升了重建的结构和语义质量，性能优于现有模型。

Conclusion: 基于视觉皮层层次表示理论的HAVIR模型能够有效解决复杂视觉刺激重建的挑战，在结构和语义质量方面均有显著提升。

Abstract: The reconstruction of visual information from brain activity fosters
interdisciplinary integration between neuroscience and computer vision.
However, existing methods still face challenges in accurately recovering highly
complex visual stimuli. This difficulty stems from the characteristics of
natural scenes: low-level features exhibit heterogeneity, while high-level
features show semantic entanglement due to contextual overlaps. Inspired by the
hierarchical representation theory of the visual cortex, we propose the HAVIR
model, which separates the visual cortex into two hierarchical regions and
extracts distinct features from each. Specifically, the Structural Generator
extracts structural information from spatial processing voxels and converts it
into latent diffusion priors, while the Semantic Extractor converts semantic
processing voxels into CLIP embeddings. These components are integrated via the
Versatile Diffusion model to synthesize the final image. Experimental results
demonstrate that HAVIR enhances both the structural and semantic quality of
reconstructions, even in complex scenes, and outperforms existing models.

Conclusion: 马尔可夫Reeb图是适用于多样化城市环境的可扩展轨迹模拟框架

Abstract: Accurately modeling human mobility is critical for urban planning,
epidemiology, and traffic management. In this work, we introduce Markovian Reeb
Graphs, a novel framework for simulating spatiotemporal trajectories that
preserve Patterns of Life (PoLs) learned from baseline data. By combining
individual- and population-level mobility structures within a probabilistic
topological model, our approach generates realistic future trajectories that
capture both consistency and variability in daily life. Evaluations on the
Urban Anomalies dataset (Atlanta and Berlin subsets) using the Jensen-Shannon
Divergence (JSD) across population- and agent-level metrics demonstrate that
the proposed method achieves strong fidelity while remaining data- and
compute-efficient. These results position Markovian Reeb Graphs as a scalable
framework for trajectory simulation with broad applicability across diverse
urban environments.

TL;DR: SpineMed是一个与脊柱外科医生共同设计的生态系统，包含首个大规模椎体级别多模态数据集SpineMed-450k和临床评估框架SpineBench，解决了脊柱疾病AI诊断中缺乏椎体级别推理数据的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脊柱疾病影响全球6.19亿人，是致残的主要原因，但AI辅助诊断因缺乏椎体级别感知的多模态数据集而受限。临床决策需要在X光、CT和MRI上对特定椎体级别进行复杂推理。

Method: 采用临床医生参与的两阶段LLM生成方法（草稿和修订），从教科书、指南、开放数据集和约1000个医院病例中整理SpineMed-450k数据集，包含45万条指令实例。

Result: 在SpineBench上的评估显示，现有大型视觉语言模型在细粒度椎体级别推理方面存在系统性弱点，而基于SpineMed-450k微调的模型在所有任务上均表现出显著改进。

Conclusion: 临床医生评估证实了该模型输出的诊断清晰度和实用性，SpineMed为脊柱疾病AI诊断提供了高质量、可追溯的数据和标准化评估框架。

Abstract: Spine disorders affect 619 million people globally and are a leading cause of
disability, yet AI-assisted diagnosis remains limited by the lack of
level-aware, multimodal datasets. Clinical decision-making for spine disorders
requires sophisticated reasoning across X-ray, CT, and MRI at specific
vertebral levels. However, progress has been constrained by the absence of
traceable, clinically-grounded instruction data and standardized,
spine-specific benchmarks. To address this, we introduce SpineMed, an ecosystem
co-designed with practicing spine surgeons. It features SpineMed-450k, the
first large-scale dataset explicitly designed for vertebral-level reasoning
across imaging modalities with over 450,000 instruction instances, and
SpineBench, a clinically-grounded evaluation framework. SpineMed-450k is
curated from diverse sources, including textbooks, guidelines, open datasets,
and ~1,000 de-identified hospital cases, using a clinician-in-the-loop pipeline
with a two-stage LLM generation method (draft and revision) to ensure
high-quality, traceable data for question-answering, multi-turn consultations,
and report generation. SpineBench evaluates models on clinically salient axes,
including level identification, pathology assessment, and surgical planning.
Our comprehensive evaluation of several recently advanced large vision-language
models (LVLMs) on SpineBench reveals systematic weaknesses in fine-grained,
level-specific reasoning. In contrast, our model fine-tuned on SpineMed-450k
demonstrates consistent and significant improvements across all tasks.
Clinician assessments confirm the diagnostic clarity and practical utility of
our model's outputs.

TL;DR: 提出UniShield多智能体统一系统，用于跨域图像伪造检测和定位，解决现有方法泛化性差和缺乏自适应框架的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着图像生成技术发展，合成图像越来越逼真，带来了错误信息和欺诈等社会风险，需要有效的伪造图像检测和定位方法来维护信息安全。

Method: UniShield创新性地集成了感知智能体和检测智能体：感知智能体分析图像特征动态选择合适检测模型，检测智能体整合多种专家检测器生成可解释报告。

Result: 大量实验表明UniShield达到最先进水平，超越了现有统一方法和领域特定检测器，展现了优越的实用性、自适应性和可扩展性。

Conclusion: UniShield能够有效检测和定位跨域图像伪造，包括图像篡改、文档篡改、DeepFake和AI生成图像，具有重要的实际应用价值。

Abstract: With the rapid advancements in image generation, synthetic images have become
increasingly realistic, posing significant societal risks, such as
misinformation and fraud. Forgery Image Detection and Localization (FIDL) thus
emerges as essential for maintaining information integrity and societal
security. Despite impressive performances by existing domain-specific detection
methods, their practical applicability remains limited, primarily due to their
narrow specialization, poor cross-domain generalization, and the absence of an
integrated adaptive framework. To address these issues, we propose UniShield,
the novel multi-agent-based unified system capable of detecting and localizing
image forgeries across diverse domains, including image manipulation, document
manipulation, DeepFake, and AI-generated images. UniShield innovatively
integrates a perception agent with a detection agent. The perception agent
intelligently analyzes image features to dynamically select suitable detection
models, while the detection agent consolidates various expert detectors into a
unified framework and generates interpretable reports. Extensive experiments
show that UniShield achieves state-of-the-art results, surpassing both existing
unified approaches and domain-specific detectors, highlighting its superior
practicality, adaptiveness, and scalability.

Motivation: 现有方法在重光照时通常需要针对每种光照条件进行优化或进行复杂的光传输模拟，缺乏能够直接在前向过程中处理任意环境光照的高效方法。

Method: 使用生成式重光照模型采样物体在不同光照环境下的外观，构建训练数据集，然后训练具有双分支架构的照明条件神经辐射场（NeRF），分别编码一般光照效果和镜面反射。

Result: 在TensoIR和Stanford-ORB数据集上评估，在大多数指标上优于现有最先进方法，并在真实世界物体捕捉上展示了良好效果。

Conclusion: ROGR方法实现了无需逐光照优化或光传输模拟的高效前向重光照，在多个数据集上表现出优越性能。

Abstract: We introduce ROGR, a novel approach that reconstructs a relightable 3D model
of an object captured from multiple views, driven by a generative relighting
model that simulates the effects of placing the object under novel environment
illuminations. Our method samples the appearance of the object under multiple
lighting environments, creating a dataset that is used to train a
lighting-conditioned Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) that outputs the object's
appearance under any input environmental lighting. The lighting-conditioned
NeRF uses a novel dual-branch architecture to encode the general lighting
effects and specularities separately. The optimized lighting-conditioned NeRF
enables efficient feed-forward relighting under arbitrary environment maps
without requiring per-illumination optimization or light transport simulation.
We evaluate our approach on the established TensoIR and Stanford-ORB datasets,
where it improves upon the state-of-the-art on most metrics, and showcase our
approach on real-world object captures.

Abstract: Interactive 3D biomedical image segmentation requires efficient models that

Abstract: Product quantisation (PQ) is a classical method for scalable vector encoding,
yet it has seen limited usage for latent representations in high-fidelity image
generation. In this work, we introduce PQGAN, a quantised image autoencoder
that integrates PQ into the well-known vector quantisation (VQ) framework of
VQGAN. PQGAN achieves a noticeable improvement over state-of-the-art methods in
terms of reconstruction performance, including both quantisation methods and
their continuous counterparts. We achieve a PSNR score of 37dB, where prior
work achieves 27dB, and are able to reduce the FID, LPIPS, and CMMD score by up
to 96%. Our key to success is a thorough analysis of the interaction between
codebook size, embedding dimensionality, and subspace factorisation, with
vector and scalar quantisation as special cases. We obtain novel findings, such
that the performance of VQ and PQ behaves in opposite ways when scaling the
embedding dimension. Furthermore, our analysis shows performance trends for PQ
that help guide optimal hyperparameter selection. Finally, we demonstrate that
PQGAN can be seamlessly integrated into pre-trained diffusion models. This
enables either a significantly faster and more compute-efficient generation, or
a doubling of the output resolution at no additional cost, positioning PQ as a
strong extension for discrete latent representation in image synthesis.

Motivation: 解决自回归视频扩散模型在游戏世界建模中的关键挑战：既要生成自然的新场景内容，又要保持已探索区域的空间一致性，同时面临有限上下文窗口的计算约束。

Method: 1. 混合训练：区分探索和重访两种游戏模式；2. 链式前向训练：通过模型滚动创建更大姿态变化；3. 点对帧检索：高效映射可见点到源帧；4. 增量3D重建：维护显式3D缓存。

Result: 在多样化环境中实现了优越的长期空间一致性和生成质量，同时保持了扩展序列的计算效率。

Conclusion: Memory Forcing框架有效解决了时空记忆权衡问题，为自回归视频扩散模型的世界建模提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Autoregressive video diffusion models have proved effective for world
modeling and interactive scene generation, with Minecraft gameplay as a
representative application. To faithfully simulate play, a model must generate
natural content while exploring new scenes and preserve spatial consistency
when revisiting explored areas. Under limited computation budgets, it must
compress and exploit historical cues within a finite context window, which
exposes a trade-off: Temporal-only memory lacks long-term spatial consistency,
whereas adding spatial memory strengthens consistency but may degrade new scene
generation quality when the model over-relies on insufficient spatial context.
We present Memory Forcing, a learning framework that pairs training protocols
with a geometry-indexed spatial memory. Hybrid Training exposes distinct
gameplay regimes, guiding the model to rely on temporal memory during
exploration and incorporate spatial memory for revisits. Chained Forward
Training extends autoregressive training with model rollouts, where chained
predictions create larger pose variations and encourage reliance on spatial
memory for maintaining consistency. Point-to-Frame Retrieval efficiently
retrieves history by mapping currently visible points to their source frames,
while Incremental 3D Reconstruction maintains and updates an explicit 3D cache.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that Memory Forcing achieves superior
long-term spatial consistency and generative quality across diverse
environments, while maintaining computational efficiency for extended
sequences.

Result: MonSTeR优于仅依赖单模态表示的三模态模型，检索分数与人类偏好一致，并在零样本场景物体放置和运动描述任务中展现多功能性。

Conclusion: MonSTeR成功构建了运动-场景-文本的统一表示空间，为跨模态检索提供了有效工具，并在多个任务中验证了其性能。

Abstract: Intention drives human movement in complex environments, but such movement
can only happen if the surrounding context supports it. Despite the intuitive
nature of this mechanism, existing research has not yet provided tools to
evaluate the alignment between skeletal movement (motion), intention (text),
and the surrounding context (scene). In this work, we introduce MonSTeR, the
first MOtioN-Scene-TExt Retrieval model. Inspired by the modeling of
higher-order relations, MonSTeR constructs a unified latent space by leveraging
unimodal and cross-modal representations. This allows MonSTeR to capture the
intricate dependencies between modalities, enabling flexible but robust
retrieval across various tasks. Our results show that MonSTeR outperforms
trimodal models that rely solely on unimodal representations. Furthermore, we
validate the alignment of our retrieval scores with human preferences through a
dedicated user study. We demonstrate the versatility of MonSTeR's latent space
on zero-shot in-Scene Object Placement and Motion Captioning. Code and

model. Unlike existing methods that rely on feature filtering or smoothing,
which can lead to information loss, we propose to "combat noise with noise" by
leveraging stochastic resonance to enhance robustness while minimizing
information loss. Our approach introduces small translational perturbations to
the input image, aligns the transformed feature embeddings, and aggregates them
before mapping back to the original reference image. This can be expressed in a
closed-form formula, which can be deployed on diverse existing network
architectures without introducing additional network modules or fine-tuning for
specific attack types. The resulting method is entirely training-free,
architecture-agnostic, and attack-agnostic. Empirical results show
state-of-the-art robustness on image classification and, for the first time,
establish a generic test-time defense for dense prediction tasks, including
stereo matching and optical flow, highlighting the method's versatility and
practicality. Specifically, relative to clean (unperturbed) performance, our
method recovers up to 68.1% of the accuracy loss on image classification, 71.9%
on stereo matching, and 29.2% on optical flow under various types of
adversarial attacks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有随机神经网络方法主要关注改进跨信息预测，没有对整体网络架构进行重大改进。

Result: 在多个具有不同特征和挑战的纯纹理基准测试中取得了有趣的结果。

Conclusion: Mixer方法在纹理识别任务中表现出色，有效结合了传统技术和学习方法的优势。

Abstract: Randomized neural networks for representation learning have consistently
achieved prominent results in texture recognition tasks, effectively combining
the advantages of both traditional techniques and learning-based approaches.
However, existing approaches have so far focused mainly on improving
cross-information prediction, without introducing significant advancements to
the overall randomized network architecture. In this paper, we propose Mixer, a
novel randomized neural network for texture representation learning. At its
core, the method leverages hyperspherical random embeddings coupled with a
dual-branch learning module to capture both intra- and inter-channel
relationships, further enhanced by a newly formulated optimization problem for
building rich texture representations. Experimental results have shown the
interesting results of the proposed approach across several pure texture
benchmarks, each with distinct characteristics and challenges. The source code
will be available upon publication.

*Suyuchen Wang,Tianyu Zhang,Ahmed Masry,Christopher Pal,Spandana Gella,Bang Liu,Perouz Taslakian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了RULER tokens和I-MRoPE两种创新方法，通过显式空间标记和对称位置编码，显著提升了GUI grounding任务在不同分辨率下的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在GUI grounding任务中面临核心瓶颈：可靠的patch-to-pixel映射在遇到训练时未见的高分辨率显示时会失效，导致坐标生成不准确。

Method: 1. RULER tokens作为显式坐标标记，让模型能够像地图网格线一样参考位置；2. I-MRoPE改进空间编码，确保宽度和高度维度对称表示。

Result: 在ScreenSpot、ScreenSpot-V2和ScreenSpot-Pro数据集上的实验显示，该方法在grounding准确率上取得一致提升，特别是在高分辨率界面上改进最大。

Conclusion: 通过提供显式空间指导而非依赖隐式学习，该方法能够在不同分辨率和平台上实现更可靠的GUI自动化。

Abstract: GUI grounding, the task of mapping natural-language instructions to pixel
coordinates, is crucial for autonomous agents, yet remains difficult for
current VLMs. The core bottleneck is reliable patch-to-pixel mapping, which
breaks when extrapolating to high-resolution displays unseen during training.
Current approaches generate coordinates as text tokens directly from visual
features, forcing the model to infer complex position-to-pixel mappings
implicitly; as a result, accuracy degrades and failures proliferate on new
resolutions. We address this with two complementary innovations. First, RULER
tokens serve as explicit coordinate markers, letting the model reference
positions similar to gridlines on a map and adjust rather than generate
coordinates from scratch. Second, Interleaved MRoPE (I-MRoPE) improves spatial
encoding by ensuring that width and height dimensions are represented equally,
addressing the asymmetry of standard positional schemes. Experiments on
ScreenSpot, ScreenSpot-V2, and ScreenSpot-Pro show consistent gains in
grounding accuracy, with the largest improvements on high-resolution
interfaces. By providing explicit spatial guidance rather than relying on
implicit learning, our approach enables more reliable GUI automation across
diverse resolutions and platforms.

Result: 在胃肠道内窥镜和体育VQA上的实验表明，LEAML在最小监督下始终优于标准微调。

Conclusion: LEAML框架在标签稀缺的专业领域任务中表现出色，证明了其有效性。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved strong performance on
general visual benchmarks but struggle with out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks in
specialized domains such as medical imaging, where labeled data is limited and
expensive. We introduce LEAML, a label-efficient adaptation framework that
leverages both scarce labeled VQA samples and abundant unlabeled images. Our
approach generates domain-relevant pseudo question-answer pairs for unlabeled
data using a QA generator regularized by caption distillation. Importantly, we
selectively update only those neurons most relevant to question-answering,
enabling the QA Generator to efficiently acquire domain-specific knowledge
during distillation. Experiments on gastrointestinal endoscopy and sports VQA
demonstrate that LEAML consistently outperforms standard fine-tuning under
minimal supervision, highlighting the effectiveness of our proposed LEAML
framework.

with MoveIt, a manipulation planning framework, allowing users to send motion
planning requests and visualize the resulting robot paths in virtual or
augmented reality. We provide a broad range of interaction modalities, allowing
users to modify objects in the environment and interact with a virtual robot.
Our system allows operators to visualize robot motions, ensuring desired

Abstract: Driving scene manipulation with sensor data is emerging as a promising
alternative to traditional virtual driving simulators. However, existing
frameworks struggle to generate realistic scenarios efficiently due to limited

including adding new objects and modifying the trajectories of both vehicles
and pedestrians, while also incorporating predictive path refinement through
multi-agent motion prediction to generate realistic interactions among all
agents in the scene. Experiments on the Waymo dataset demonstrate SIMSplat's
extensive editing capabilities and adaptability across a wide range of
scenarios. Project page: https://sungyeonparkk.github.io/simsplat/

TL;DR: U-LAG是一个中间执行目标重定向层，能够在感知延迟的情况下重新调整任务目标，而不改变底层控制器。主要贡献包括UAR-PF不确定性感知重定向器、可插拔重定向接口以及可复现的Shift x Lag基准测试。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器人在变化环境中操作时，必须处理延迟、噪声或过时的感知信息。现有方法如运动重定向或通用视觉伺服不能很好地处理飞行中的目标重定向问题。

Method: 提出UAR-PF不确定性感知重定向器，在感知延迟下维护物体姿态分布，并选择最大化预期进展的目标。采用可插拔的中间层设计，在感知和控制之间插入目标重定向模块。

Result: 在PyBullet/PandaGym中进行了可复现的Shift x Lag压力测试，涵盖拾取、推动、堆叠和销钉插入任务。在0-10cm偏移和0-400ms延迟条件下，UAR-PF和ICP相比无重定向基线表现更好，成功率高，末端执行器移动距离适中，中止次数少。

Conclusion: U-LAG提供了一种有效的中间执行目标重定向方法，能够在感知延迟情况下保持操作性能，通过简单的操作安全措施进一步提高稳定性。

Abstract: Robots manipulating in changing environments must act on percepts that are
late, noisy, or stale. We present U-LAG, a mid-execution goal-retargeting layer
that leaves the low-level controller unchanged while re-aiming task goals
(pre-contact, contact, post) as new observations arrive. Unlike motion
retargeting or generic visual servoing, U-LAG treats in-flight goal re-aiming
as a first-class, pluggable module between perception and control. Our main
technical contribution is UAR-PF, an uncertainty-aware retargeter that
maintains a distribution over object pose under sensing lag and selects goals
that maximize expected progress. We instantiate a reproducible Shift x Lag
stress test in PyBullet/PandaGym for pick, push, stacking, and peg insertion,
where the object undergoes abrupt in-plane shifts while synthetic perception
lag is injected during approach. Across 0-10 cm shifts and 0-400 ms lags,
UAR-PF and ICP degrade gracefully relative to a no-retarget baseline, achieving
higher success with modest end-effector travel and fewer aborts; simple
operational safeguards further improve stability. Contributions: (1) UAR-PF for
lag-adaptive, uncertainty-aware goal retargeting; (2) a pluggable retargeting
interface; and (3) a reproducible Shift x Lag benchmark with evaluation on
pick, push, stacking, and peg insertion.

struggle with poor data coverage and severe performance degradation. We propose
a solution that leverages robot simulators to achieve online imitation
learning. Our sim-to-real framework is based on world models and combines
online imitation pretraining with offline finetuning. By leveraging online
interactions, our approach alleviates the data coverage limitations of offline
methods, leading to improved robustness and reduced performance degradation
during finetuning. It also enhances generalization during domain transfer. Our
empirical results demonstrate its effectiveness, improving success rates by at
least 31.7% in sim-to-sim transfer and 23.3% in sim-to-real transfer over
existing offline imitation learning baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Koopman方法仅关注系统动力学的线性化，而本文旨在为包含非线性机器人动力学和避障约束的最优路径规划问题寻找全局线性表示，以提高计算效率。

Method: 使用扩展动态模式分解从输入状态数据中识别线性和双线性Koopman实现，在提升空间中构建二次规划问题，并在MPC框架中确定最优机器人动作。

Result: 双线性Koopman模型能准确捕捉非线性状态-输入耦合和避障所需的二次项，而线性实现无法做到。该方法比在原始状态空间求解的非线性MPC快320倍。

Conclusion: 双线性Koopman实现对于具有非线性状态和输入约束的高度非线性最优控制问题的线性化具有潜力，可实现类似线性问题的计算效率。

Abstract: This paper presents a data-driven model predictive control framework for
mobile robots navigating in dynamic environments, leveraging Koopman operator
theory. Unlike the conventional Koopman-based approaches that focus on the
linearization of system dynamics only, our work focuses on finding a global
linear representation for the optimal path planning problem that includes both
the nonlinear robot dynamics and collision-avoidance constraints. We deploy
extended dynamic mode decomposition to identify linear and bilinear Koopman
realizations from input-state data. Our open-loop analysis demonstrates that
only the bilinear Koopman model can accurately capture nonlinear state-input
couplings and quadratic terms essential for collision avoidance, whereas linear
realizations fail to do so. We formulate a quadratic program for the robot path
planning in the presence of moving obstacles in the lifted space and determine
the optimal robot action in an MPC framework. Our approach is capable of
finding the safe optimal action 320 times faster than a nonlinear MPC
counterpart that solves the path planning problem in the original state space.
Our work highlights the potential of bilinear Koopman realizations for
linearization of highly nonlinear optimal control problems subject to nonlinear
state and input constraints to achieve computational efficiency similar to
linear problems.

Motivation: 传统ROV远程操作依赖低分辨率2D摄像头，缺乏沉浸式和感官反馈，在复杂海底环境中降低了操作者的态势感知能力。

Method: 提出SubSense框架，包含非侵入式反馈接口，将1-DOF机械臂与操作者手套配对以提供触觉反馈和抓握状态，并集成端到端软件管理控制输入和通过VR平台显示沉浸式摄像头视图。

Result: 通过全面实验和用户研究验证了系统有效性，相比传统远程操作界面，在精细操作任务中表现更佳。

Conclusion: 多感官反馈在沉浸式虚拟环境中具有显著改善远程态势感知和任务性能的潜力，为现场ROV操作提供更直观和易用的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper investigates the integration of haptic feedback and virtual
reality (VR) control interfaces to enhance teleoperation and telemanipulation
of underwater ROVs (remotely operated vehicles). Traditional ROV teleoperation
relies on low-resolution 2D camera feeds and lacks immersive and sensory
feedback, which diminishes situational awareness in complex subsea
environments. We propose SubSense -- a novel VR-Haptic framework incorporating
a non-invasive feedback interface to an otherwise 1-DOF (degree of freedom)
manipulator, which is paired with the teleoperator's glove to provide haptic
feedback and grasp status. Additionally, our framework integrates end-to-end
software for managing control inputs and displaying immersive camera views
through a VR platform. We validate the system through comprehensive experiments
and user studies, demonstrating its effectiveness over conventional
teleoperation interfaces, particularly for delicate manipulation tasks. Our
results highlight the potential of multisensory feedback in immersive virtual
environments to significantly improve remote situational awareness and mission
performance, offering more intuitive and accessible ROV operations in the
field.

Abstract: We introduce UMI-on-Air, a framework for embodiment-aware deployment of
embodiment-agnostic manipulation policies. Our approach leverages diverse,
unconstrained human demonstrations collected with a handheld gripper (UMI) to
train generalizable visuomotor policies. A central challenge in transferring
these policies to constrained robotic embodiments-such as aerial
manipulators-is the mismatch in control and robot dynamics, which often leads
to out-of-distribution behaviors and poor execution. To address this, we
propose Embodiment-Aware Diffusion Policy (EADP), which couples a high-level
UMI policy with a low-level embodiment-specific controller at inference time.
By integrating gradient feedback from the controller's tracking cost into the
diffusion sampling process, our method steers trajectory generation towards
dynamically feasible modes tailored to the deployment embodiment. This enables
plug-and-play, embodiment-aware trajectory adaptation at test time. We validate
our approach on multiple long-horizon and high-precision aerial manipulation
tasks, showing improved success rates, efficiency, and robustness under
disturbances compared to unguided diffusion baselines. Finally, we demonstrate
deployment in previously unseen environments, using UMI demonstrations
collected in the wild, highlighting a practical pathway for scaling
generalizable manipulation skills across diverse-and even highly
constrained-embodiments. All code, data, and checkpoints will be publicly
released after acceptance. Result videos can be found at umi-on-air.github.io.

Conclusion: 该模块化框架成功解决了动态环境下的SLAM问题，通过语义信息有效减轻了动态物体的影响，实现了鲁棒的相机跟踪。

Abstract: Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) plays an important role in many
robotics fields, including social robots. Many of the available visual SLAM
methods are based on the assumption of a static world and struggle in dynamic
environments. In the current study, we introduce a real-time semantic RGBD SLAM
approach designed specifically for dynamic environments. Our proposed system
can effectively detect moving objects and maintain a static map to ensure
robust camera tracking. The key innovation of our approach is the incorporation
of deep learning-based semantic information into SLAM systems to mitigate the
impact of dynamic objects. Additionally, we enhance the semantic segmentation
process by integrating an Extended Kalman filter to identify dynamic objects
that may be temporarily idle. We have also implemented a generative network to
fill in the missing regions of input images belonging to dynamic objects. This
highly modular framework has been implemented on the ROS platform and can
achieve around 22 fps on a GTX1080. Benchmarking the developed pipeline on
dynamic sequences from the TUM dataset suggests that the proposed approach
delivers competitive localization error in comparison with the state-of-the-art
methods, all while operating in near real-time. The source code is publicly

Conclusion: 提出的算法在系统动力学未知甚至突变的情况下，仍能保证系统跟随分段线性轨迹，具有重要的实际应用价值。

Abstract: This paper proposes an algorithm capable of driving a system to follow a
piecewise linear trajectory without prior knowledge of the system dynamics.
Motivated by a critical failure scenario in which a system can experience an
abrupt change in its dynamics, we demonstrate that it is possible to follow a
set of waypoints comprised of states analytically proven to be reachable
despite not knowing the system dynamics. The proposed algorithm first applies
small perturbations to locally learn the system dynamics around the current
state, then computes the set of states that are provably reachable using the
locally learned dynamics and their corresponding maximum growth-rate bounds,
and finally synthesizes a control action that navigates the system to a
guaranteed reachable state.

Conclusion: 所提出的框架能够实现精确可靠的多机器人编队导航，即使在具有挑战性的场景下也能保持编队稳定性。

Abstract: Rigid-formation navigation of multiple robots is essential for applications
such as cooperative transportation. This process involves a team of
collaborative robots maintaining a predefined geometric configuration, such as
a square, while in motion. For untethered collaborative motion, inter-robot
communication must be conducted through a wireless network. Notably, few
existing works offer a comprehensive solution for multi-robot formation
navigation executable on microprocessor platforms via wireless networks,
particularly for formations that must traverse complex curvilinear paths. To
address this gap, we introduce a novel "hold-and-hit" communication-control
framework designed to work seamlessly with the widely-used Robotic Operating
System (ROS) platform. The hold-and-hit framework synchronizes robot movements
in a manner robust against wireless network delays and packet loss. It operates
over discrete-time communication-control cycles, making it suitable for
implementation on contemporary microprocessors. Complementary to hold-and-hit,
we propose an intra-cycle optimization approach that enables rigid formations
to closely follow desired curvilinear paths, even under the nonholonomic
movement constraints inherent to most vehicular robots. The combination of
hold-and-hit and intra-cycle optimization ensures precise and reliable
navigation even in challenging scenarios. Simulations in a virtual environment
demonstrate the superiority of our method in maintaining a four-robot square
formation along an S-shaped path, outperforming two existing approaches.
Furthermore, real-world experiments validate the effectiveness of our
framework: the robots maintained an inter-distance error within $\pm 0.069m$
and an inter-angular orientation error within $\pm19.15^{\circ}$ while
navigating along an S-shaped path at a fixed linear velocity of $0.1 m/s$.

TL;DR: 提出了一种轨迹生成框架，通过结构化网格表示和行为感知生成机制，增强场景密度和行为多样性，解决现有数据集长尾分布问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有轨迹预测数据集存在明显的长尾分布问题，大多数样本来自低密度场景和简单直线驾驶行为，缺乏高密度场景和安全关键操作（如变道、超车、转弯）的代表性，这阻碍了模型泛化能力并导致评估过于乐观。

Conclusion: 该框架能够合成真实的高密度场景和复杂交互的罕见行为，弥补了真实数据中的缺失，为自动驾驶轨迹预测提供了更全面的数据支持。

Abstract: Accurate trajectory prediction is fundamental to autonomous driving, as it
underpins safe motion planning and collision avoidance in complex environments.
However, existing benchmark datasets suffer from a pronounced long-tail
distribution problem, with most samples drawn from low-density scenarios and
simple straight-driving behaviors. This underrepresentation of high-density
scenarios and safety critical maneuvers such as lane changes, overtaking and
turning is an obstacle to model generalization and leads to overly optimistic
evaluations. To address these challenges, we propose a novel trajectory
generation framework that simultaneously enhances scenarios density and
enriches behavioral diversity. Specifically, our approach converts continuous
road environments into a structured grid representation that supports
fine-grained path planning, explicit conflict detection, and multi-agent
coordination. Built upon this representation, we introduce behavior-aware
generation mechanisms that combine rule-based decision triggers with
Frenet-based trajectory smoothing and dynamic feasibility constraints. This
design allows us to synthesize realistic high-density scenarios and rare
behaviors with complex interactions that are often missing in real data.
Extensive experiments on the large-scale Argoverse 1 and Argoverse 2 datasets
demonstrate that our method significantly improves both agent density and
behavior diversity, while preserving motion realism and scenario-level safety.
Our synthetic data also benefits downstream trajectory prediction models and
enhances performance in challenging high-density scenarios.

*Junlin Zeng,Xin Zhang,Xiang Zhao,Yan Pan*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了iLLM-A*算法，通过优化A*搜索、增量学习生成高质量路径点、智能选择路径点等机制，在网格地图路径规划中相比LLM-A*实现了1000倍以上的加速和显著的内存节省。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有路径规划方法（如A*、Dijkstra）在大规模地图上搜索时间和内存消耗过高，而基于大语言模型的方法存在空间幻觉和规划性能差的问题。LLM-A*虽然结合了LLM和A*，但在大规模地图上计算时间仍然很高。

Method: 设计了iLLM-A*算法，包含三个核心机制：1）优化A*搜索算法；2）使用增量学习方法让LLM生成高质量路径点；3）为A*规划选择适当的路径点。

Result: 在多种网格地图上的评估显示，相比LLM-A*：1）平均加速超过1000倍，极端情况下达到2349.5倍；2）节省高达58.6%的内存成本；3）路径长度更短且标准差更低。

Conclusion: iLLM-A*通过精心设计的机制有效解决了LLM-A*的性能瓶颈，在大规模网格地图路径规划中实现了显著的性能提升。

Abstract: Path planning in grid maps, arising from various applications, has garnered
significant attention. Existing methods, such as A*, Dijkstra, and their
variants, work well for small-scale maps but fail to address large-scale ones
due to high search time and memory consumption. Recently, Large Language Models
(LLMs) have shown remarkable performance in path planning but still suffer from
spatial illusion and poor planning performance. Among all the works, LLM-A*
\cite{meng2024llm} leverages LLM to generate a series of waypoints and then
uses A* to plan the paths between the neighboring waypoints. In this way, the
complete path is constructed. However, LLM-A* still suffers from high
computational time for large-scale maps. To fill this gap, we conducted a deep
investigation into LLM-A* and found its bottleneck, resulting in limited
performance. Accordingly, we design an innovative LLM-enhanced algorithm, abbr.
as iLLM-A*. iLLM-A* includes 3 carefully designed mechanisms, including the
optimization of A*, an incremental learning method for LLM to generate
high-quality waypoints, and the selection of the appropriate waypoints for A*
for path planning. Finally, a comprehensive evaluation on various grid maps
shows that, compared with LLM-A*, iLLM-A* \textbf{1) achieves more than
$1000\times$ speedup on average, and up to $2349.5\times$ speedup in the
extreme case, 2) saves up to $58.6\%$ of the memory cost, 3) achieves both
obviously shorter path length and lower path length standard deviation.}

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决跨模态无人机导航中自然语言描述与视觉内容之间的细粒度语义匹配问题，特别是在复杂空中场景中基线方法难以实现精细语义匹配

Method: 首先使用基线模型获取前20个最相关图像的初始粗排名，然后使用视觉语言模型为候选图像生成详细描述，最后在多模态相似度计算框架中进行细粒度重排序

Conclusion: 语义优化策略在实际机器人导航场景中具有实用价值，证明了通过生成描述构建视觉内容与自然语言描述之间语义桥梁的有效性

Abstract: Cross-modal drone navigation remains a challenging task in robotics,
requiring efficient retrieval of relevant images from large-scale databases
based on natural language descriptions. The RoboSense 2025 Track 4 challenge
addresses this challenge, focusing on robust, natural language-guided
cross-view image retrieval across multiple platforms (drones, satellites, and
ground cameras). Current baseline methods, while effective for initial
retrieval, often struggle to achieve fine-grained semantic matching between
text queries and visual content, especially in complex aerial scenes. To
address this challenge, we propose a two-stage retrieval refinement method:
Caption-Guided Retrieval System (CGRS) that enhances the baseline coarse
ranking through intelligent reranking. Our method first leverages a baseline
model to obtain an initial coarse ranking of the top 20 most relevant images
for each query. We then use Vision-Language-Model (VLM) to generate detailed
captions for these candidate images, capturing rich semantic descriptions of
their visual content. These generated captions are then used in a multimodal
similarity computation framework to perform fine-grained reranking of the
original text query, effectively building a semantic bridge between the visual
content and natural language descriptions. Our approach significantly improves
upon the baseline, achieving a consistent 5\% improvement across all key
metrics (Recall@1, Recall@5, and Recall@10). Our approach win TOP-2 in the
challenge, demonstrating the practical value of our semantic refinement
strategy in real-world robotic navigation scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉运动策略在处理需要持续接触的任务时忽视顺应性，导致接触力过大或行为脆弱。引入力信息可改善接触感知，但需要大量数据。模拟数据生成可缓解数据稀缺，但面临Sim2Real差距挑战

Method: 开发了基于单次人类演示生成力感知模拟数据的框架，结合顺应性策略来学习视觉运动策略

Conclusion: 该方法通过力感知模拟数据和顺应性策略的结合，有效提升了视觉运动策略在接触丰富任务中的性能

Abstract: While visuomotor policy has made advancements in recent years, contact-rich
tasks still remain a challenge. Robotic manipulation tasks that require
continuous contact demand explicit handling of compliance and force. However,
most visuomotor policies ignore compliance, overlooking the importance of
physical interaction with the real world, often leading to excessive contact
forces or fragile behavior under uncertainty. Introducing force information
into vision-based imitation learning could help improve awareness of contacts,
but could also require a lot of data to perform well. One remedy for data
scarcity is to generate data in simulation, yet computationally taxing
processes are required to generate data good enough not to suffer from the
Sim2Real gap. In this work, we introduce a framework for generating
force-informed data in simulation, instantiated by a single human
demonstration, and show how coupling with a compliant policy improves the
performance of a visuomotor policy learned from synthetic data. We validate our
approach on real-robot tasks, including non-prehensile block flipping and a
bi-manual object moving, where the learned policy exhibits reliable contact
maintenance and adaptation to novel conditions. Project Website:

TL;DR: 该论文首次系统研究视觉语言模型在工作区轨迹规划中的表现，发现主流VLMs在68%的情况下无法生成正确轨迹，并提出REACT-Drive框架，通过检索增强生成技术显著提升轨迹规划性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工作区具有不规则布局、临时交通控制和动态变化的几何结构等复杂特征，而视觉语言模型在这类环境中的轨迹规划能力尚未被探索，需要填补这一研究空白。

Method: 提出REACT-Drive框架，结合VLMs和检索增强生成技术：首先通过子图挖掘和聚类分析识别失败模式，然后利用VLMs将先前的失败案例转化为约束规则和可执行代码，RAG在新场景中检索相似模式来指导轨迹生成。

Result: 在ROADWork数据集上，REACT-Drive相比VLM基线平均位移误差减少约3倍，推理时间仅为0.58秒（远低于微调的17.90秒），并在15个真实工作区场景中验证了其强实用性。

Conclusion: REACT-Drive框架有效解决了VLMs在工作区轨迹规划中的局限性，通过结合先验知识和实时检索，显著提升了轨迹规划的准确性和效率，具有重要的实际应用价值。

Abstract: Visual Language Models (VLMs), with powerful multimodal reasoning
capabilities, are gradually integrated into autonomous driving by several
automobile manufacturers to enhance planning capability in challenging
environments. However, the trajectory planning capability of VLMs in work
zones, which often include irregular layouts, temporary traffic control, and
dynamically changing geometric structures, is still unexplored. To bridge this
gap, we conduct the \textit{first} systematic study of VLMs for work zone
trajectory planning, revealing that mainstream VLMs fail to generate correct
trajectories in $68.0%$ of cases. To better understand these failures, we first
identify candidate patterns via subgraph mining and clustering analysis, and
then confirm the validity of $8$ common failure patterns through human
verification. Building on these findings, we propose REACT-Drive, a trajectory
planning framework that integrates VLMs with Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG). Specifically, REACT-Drive leverages VLMs to convert prior failure cases
into constraint rules and executable trajectory planning code, while RAG
retrieves similar patterns in new scenarios to guide trajectory generation.
Experimental results on the ROADWork dataset show that REACT-Drive yields a
reduction of around $3\times$ in average displacement error relative to VLM
baselines under evaluation with Qwen2.5-VL. In addition, REACT-Drive yields the
lowest inference time ($0.58$s) compared with other methods such as fine-tuning
($17.90$s). We further conduct experiments using a real vehicle in 15 work zone
scenarios in the physical world, demonstrating the strong practicality of
REACT-Drive.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于实时脚趾间隙的闭环FES控制器，相比传统开环控制器，能在保证足够脚趾间隙的同时显著降低刺激强度，减少肌肉疲劳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统开环FES控制器使用固定刺激强度，存在过度刺激导致肌肉疲劳或刺激不足增加跌倒风险的问题，需要更智能的控制方法。

Method: 开发了基于实时脚趾间隙的闭环FES控制器，通过在健康参与者中诱导足下垂，比较闭环与开环控制器在不同步行条件下的效果。

Result: 闭环控制器在保持足够脚趾间隙的同时，显著降低了刺激强度，且未显著影响髋、膝、踝关节角度。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅与传统系统效果相当，还能减少肌肉疲劳，提高长期使用舒适度和依从性。

Abstract: Foot drop is commonly managed using Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES),
typically delivered via open-loop controllers with fixed stimulation
intensities. While users may manually adjust the intensity through external
controls, this approach risks overstimulation, leading to muscle fatigue and
discomfort, or understimulation, which compromises dorsiflexion and increases
fall risk. In this study, we propose a novel closed-loop FES controller that
dynamically adjusts the stimulation intensity based on real-time toe clearance,
providing "assistance as needed". We evaluate this system by inducing foot drop
in healthy participants and comparing the effects of the closed-loop controller
with a traditional open-loop controller across various walking conditions,
including different speeds and surface inclinations. Kinematic data reveal that
our closed-loop controller maintains adequate toe clearance without
significantly affecting the joint angles of the hips, the knees, and the
ankles, and while using significantly lower stimulation intensities compared to
the open-loop controller. These findings suggest that the proposed method not
only matches the effectiveness of existing systems but also offers the
potential for reduced muscle fatigue and improved long-term user comfort and
adherence.

Motivation: 为了支持自动驾驶和工业机器人等延迟敏感的AI应用，6G网络需要分布式机器学习。然而，行为克隆策略无法像文本生成那样并行验证多个草稿，因为每个动作都依赖于前一个动作更新的观察结果。

Method: 提出了动作偏差感知混合推理方法，其中草稿模型估计动作是否需要目标模型验证和校正，并选择性地跳过服务器操作。通过推导路径偏差阈值来平衡传输速率和推理性能。

Result: 动作偏差感知混合推理将上行传输和服务器操作减少了40%，端到端延迟降低了33.32%，任务成功率达到了目标模型单独推理的97.03%。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了分布式机器学习中行为克隆策略的验证瓶颈，显著降低了通信和计算开销，同时保持了高性能。

Abstract: To support latency-sensitive AI applications ranging from autonomous driving
to industrial robot manipulation, 6G envisions distributed ML, connecting
distributed computational resources in edge and cloud over hyper-reliable
low-latency communication (HRLLC). In this setting, speculative decoding can
facilitate collaborative inference of models distributively deployed: an
on-device draft model locally generates drafts and a remote server-based target
model verifies and corrects them, resulting lower latency. However, unlike
autoregressive text generation, behavior cloning policies, typically used for
embodied AI applications like robot manipulation and autonomous driving, cannot
parallelize verification and correction for multiple drafts as each action
depends on observation which needs to be updated by a previous action. To this
end, we propose Action Deviation-Aware Hybrid Inference, wherein the draft
model estimates an action's need for verification and correction by the target
model and selectively skips communication and computation for server
operations. Action deviation shows a strong correlation with action's rejection
probability by the target model, enabling selective skipping. We derive the
path deviation threshold that balances the transmission rate and the inference
performance, and we empirically show that action deviation-aware hybrid
inference reduces uplink transmission and server operation by 40%, while
lowering end-to-end latency by 33.32% relative to hybrid inference without
skipping and achieving task success rate up to 97.03% of that of target model
only inference.

Motivation: 传统的外感受传感器（如LiDAR和相机）在能见度差的环境中感知能力受限，而超宽带雷达能够穿透恶劣环境条件（如灰尘、烟雾和雨水），但单个扫描无法重建详细图像。

Method: 通过移动机器人路径合成虚拟大孔径，生成合成孔径雷达图像，并评估SIFT、SURF、BRISK、AKAZE和ORB等经典特征检测器在UWB SAR图像上进行环闭检测的性能。

Result: 实验结果表明UWB SAR成像在高分辨率环境映射和环闭检测方面具有可行性和有效性。

Conclusion: UWB SAR成像技术能够为机器人感知系统提供更鲁棒和可靠的解决方案，特别是在恶劣环境条件下。

Abstract: Traditional exteroceptive sensors in mobile robots, such as LiDARs and
cameras often struggle to perceive the environment in poor visibility
conditions. Recently, radar technologies, such as ultra-wideband (UWB) have
emerged as potential alternatives due to their ability to see through adverse
environmental conditions (e.g. dust, smoke and rain). However, due to the small
apertures with low directivity, the UWB radars cannot reconstruct a detailed
image of its field of view (FOV) using a single scan. Hence, a virtual large
aperture is synthesized by moving the radar along a mobile robot path. The
resulting synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image is a high-definition
representation of the surrounding environment. Hence, this paper proposes a
pipeline for mobile robots to incorporate UWB radar-based SAR imaging to map an
unknown environment. Finally, we evaluated the performance of classical feature
detectors: SIFT, SURF, BRISK, AKAZE and ORB to identify loop closures using UWB
SAR images. The experiments were conducted emulating adverse environmental
conditions. The results demonstrate the viability and effectiveness of UWB SAR
imaging for high-resolution environmental mapping and loop closure detection
toward more robust and reliable robotic perception systems.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel motion planning algorithm to facilitate
safety-critical navigation for autonomous mobile robots. The proposed algorithm
integrates a real-time dynamic obstacle tracking and mapping system that
categorizes point clouds into dynamic and static components. For dynamic point
clouds, the Kalman filter is employed to estimate and predict their motion
states. Based on these predictions, we extrapolate the future states of dynamic
point clouds, which are subsequently merged with static point clouds to
construct the forward-time-domain (FTD) map. By combining control barrier
functions (CBFs) with nonlinear model predictive control, the proposed
algorithm enables the robot to effectively avoid both static and dynamic
obstacles. The CBF constraints are formulated based on risk points identified
through collision detection between the predicted future states and the FTD
map. Experimental results from both simulated and real-world scenarios
demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm in complex environments. In
simulation experiments, the proposed algorithm is compared with two baseline
approaches, showing superior performance in terms of safety and robustness in
obstacle avoidance. The source code is released for the reference of the
robotics community.

Conclusion: 需要开发新的数值指标来更好地代表人类主观感知，以实现更可靠的社交导航系统评估。

Abstract: Social, also called human-aware, navigation is a key challenge for the
integration of mobile robots into human environments. The evaluation of such
systems is complex, as factors such as comfort, safety, and legibility must be
considered. Human-centered assessments, typically conducted through surveys,
provide reliable insights but are costly, resource-intensive, and difficult to
reproduce or compare across systems. Alternatively, numerical social navigation
metrics are easy to compute and facilitate comparisons, yet the community lacks
consensus on a standard set of metrics.
  This work explores the relationship between numerical metrics and
human-centered evaluations to identify potential correlations. If specific
quantitative measures align with human perceptions, they could serve as
standardized evaluation tools, reducing the dependency on surveys. Our results
indicate that while current metrics capture some aspects of robot navigation
behavior, important subjective factors remain insufficiently represented and
new metrics are necessary.

Abstract: A complete mechatronic design of a minimal configuration brachiation robot is
presented. The robot consists of a single rigid rod with gripper mechanisms
attached to both ends. The grippers are used to hang the robot on a horizontal
bar on which it swings or rotates. The motion is imposed by repositioning the
robot's center of mass, which is performed using a crank-slide mechanism. Based
on a non-linear model, an optimal control strategy is proposed, for
repositioning the center of mass in a bang-bang manner. Consequently, utilizing
the concept of input-output linearization, a continuous control strategy is
proposed that takes into account the limited torque of the crank-slide
mechanism and its geometry. An increased attention is paid to energy
accumulation towards the subsequent jump stage of the brachiation. These two
strategies are validated and compared in simulations. The continuous control
strategy is then also implemented within a low-cost STM32-based control system,
and both the swing and rotation stages of the brachiation motion are
experimentally validated.

Abstract: Achieving precise lateral motion modeling and decoupled control in hover
remains a significant challenge for tail-sitter Unmanned Aerial Vehicles
(UAVs), primarily due to complex aerodynamic couplings and the absence of
welldefined lateral dynamics. This paper presents a novel modeling and control
strategy that enhances yaw authority and lateral motion by introducing a
sideslip force model derived from differential propeller slipstream effects
acting on the fuselage under differential thrust. The resulting lateral force
along the body y-axis enables yaw-based lateral position control without
inducing roll coupling. The control framework employs a YXZ Euler rotation
formulation to accurately represent attitude and incorporate gravitational
components while directly controlling yaw in the yaxis, thereby improving
lateral dynamic behavior and avoiding singularities. The proposed approach is
validated through trajectory-tracking simulations conducted in a Unity-based
environment. Tests on both rectangular and circular paths in hover mode
demonstrate stable performance, with low mean absolute position errors and yaw
deviations constrained within 5.688 degrees. These results confirm the
effectiveness of the proposed lateral force generation model and provide a
foundation for the development of agile, hover-capable tail-sitter UAVs.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for estimating the position and
orientation of flexible manipulators undergoing vertical motion using multiple
inertial measurement units (IMUs), optimized and calibrated with ground truth

angles estimated from accelerometer and gyroscope measurements acquired by
cost-effective IMUs. A complementary filter is employed to fuse the
measurements, with its parameters optimized through particle swarm optimization
(PSO) to mitigate noise and delay. To further improve estimation accuracy,
residual errors in position and orientation are compensated using radial basis
function neural networks (RBFNN). Experimental results validate the
effectiveness of the proposed intelligent multi-IMU kinematic estimation
method, achieving root mean square errors (RMSE) of 0.00021~m, 0.00041~m, and
0.00024~rad for $y$, $z$, and $\theta$, respectively.

Abstract: This paper presents a framework for real-time optimal controlling of a
heavy-duty skid-steered mobile platform for trajectory tracking. The importance
of accurate real-time performance of the controller lies in safety
considerations of situations where the dynamic system under control is affected
by uncertainties and disturbances, and the controller should compensate for
such phenomena in order to provide stable performance. A multiple-shooting
nonlinear model-predictive control framework is proposed in this paper. This
framework benefits from suitable algorithm along with readings from various
sensors for genuine real-time performance with extremely high accuracy. The
controller is then tested for tracking different trajectories where it
demonstrates highly desirable performance in terms of both speed and accuracy.
This controller shows remarkable improvement when compared to existing
nonlinear model-predictive controllers in the literature that were implemented
on skid-steered mobile platforms.

Abstract: Diffusion models, as a class of deep generative models, have recently emerged
as powerful tools for robot skills by enabling stable training with reliable
convergence. In this paper, we present an end-to-end framework for generating
long, smooth trajectories that explicitly target high surface coverage across
various industrial tasks, including polishing, robotic painting, and spray
coating. The conventional methods are always fundamentally constrained by their
predefined functional forms, which limit the shapes of the trajectories they
can represent and make it difficult to handle complex and diverse tasks.
Moreover, their generalization is poor, often requiring manual redesign or
extensive parameter tuning when applied to new scenarios. These limitations
highlight the need for more expressive generative models, making
diffusion-based approaches a compelling choice for trajectory generation. By
iteratively denoising trajectories with carefully learned noise schedules and
conditioning mechanisms, diffusion models not only ensure smooth and consistent
motion but also flexibly adapt to the task context. In experiments, our method
improves trajectory continuity, maintains high coverage, and generalizes to
unseen shapes, paving the way for unified end-to-end trajectory learning across
industrial surface-processing tasks without category-specific models. On
average, our approach improves Point-wise Chamfer Distance by 98.2\% and
smoothness by 97.0\%, while increasing surface coverage by 61\% compared to
prior methods. The link to our code can be found

TL;DR: HumanoidExo系统通过将人类运动转换为全身人形机器人数据，解决了人形机器人策略学习中大规模数据集获取的瓶颈问题，显著提升了机器人在动态现实场景中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决人形机器人策略学习中大规模、多样化数据集获取困难且成本高昂的问题，克服真实世界数据收集的局限性。

Method: 开发HumanoidExo系统，将人类运动转移到全身人形机器人数据，最小化人类演示者与机器人之间的体现差距。

Result: 在三个具有挑战性的真实世界任务中验证了方法的有效性：桌面操作、结合站立-蹲下动作的操作以及全身操作。仅需5个真实机器人演示即可学习复杂全身控制，并能从HumanoidExo数据中学习新技能（如行走）。

Conclusion: HumanoidExo是真实机器人数据的重要补充，能够使人形策略泛化到新环境，从少量真实演示学习复杂控制，并仅从模拟数据获取新技能。

Abstract: A significant bottleneck in humanoid policy learning is the acquisition of
large-scale, diverse datasets, as collecting reliable real-world data remains
both difficult and cost-prohibitive. To address this limitation, we introduce
HumanoidExo, a novel system that transfers human motion to whole-body humanoid
data. HumanoidExo offers a high-efficiency solution that minimizes the
embodiment gap between the human demonstrator and the robot, thereby tackling
the scarcity of whole-body humanoid data. By facilitating the collection of
more voluminous and diverse datasets, our approach significantly enhances the
performance of humanoid robots in dynamic, real-world scenarios. We evaluated
our method across three challenging real-world tasks: table-top manipulation,
manipulation integrated with stand-squat motions, and whole-body manipulation.
Our results empirically demonstrate that HumanoidExo is a crucial addition to
real-robot data, as it enables the humanoid policy to generalize to novel
environments, learn complex whole-body control from only five real-robot
demonstrations, and even acquire new skills (i.e., walking) solely from
HumanoidExo data.

Motivation: 长期人体运动预测对自主机器人和车辆在共享环境中的安全高效运行至关重要，需要准确预测来支持运动规划、人机交互等应用。

Method: 利用动态地图编码空间或时空运动模式作为环境特征，提出MoD-informed LHMP框架，包含排序方法输出最可能轨迹，并引入时间条件MoD捕捉不同时间段的运动模式变化。

Abstract: Long-term human motion prediction (LHMP) is important for the safe and
efficient operation of autonomous robots and vehicles in environments shared
with humans. Accurate predictions are important for applications including
motion planning, tracking, human-robot interaction, and safety monitoring. In
this paper, we exploit Maps of Dynamics (MoDs), which encode spatial or
spatio-temporal motion patterns as environment features, to achieve LHMP for
horizons of up to 60 seconds. We propose an MoD-informed LHMP framework that
supports various types of MoDs and includes a ranking method to output the most
likely predicted trajectory, improving practical utility in robotics. Further,
a time-conditioned MoD is introduced to capture motion patterns that vary
across different times of day. We evaluate MoD-LHMP instantiated with three
types of MoDs. Experiments on two real-world datasets show that MoD-informed
method outperforms learning-based ones, with up to 50\% improvement in average
displacement error, and the time-conditioned variant achieves the highest
accuracy overall. Project code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前研究主要关注固定机器人结构的控制策略优化，但为了实现真正适应多样化现实环境的通用物理智能体，需要同时进化控制策略和物理结构。

Method: 提出基于战略探索、Sim2Real迁移和元策略学习的实用协同设计方法，从方法论、应用驱动和社区导向三个角度分析协同设计的必要性。

Result: 确立了协同设计作为开发下一代智能自适应人形机器人的基石地位，提出了从短期创新到长期目标的开放研究问题。

Conclusion: 协同设计是实现真正具身智能的关键，需要同时进化机器人的形态和行为，以在特定任务和资源受限环境中优化性能。

Abstract: Humanoid robots, as general-purpose physical agents, must integrate both
intelligent control and adaptive morphology to operate effectively in diverse
real-world environments. While recent research has focused primarily on
optimizing control policies for fixed robot structures, this position paper
argues for evolving both control strategies and humanoid robots' physical
structure under a co-design mechanism. Inspired by biological evolution, this
approach enables robots to iteratively adapt both their form and behavior to
optimize performance within task-specific and resource-constrained contexts.
Despite its promise, co-design in humanoid robotics remains a relatively
underexplored domain, raising fundamental questions about its feasibility and
necessity in achieving true embodied intelligence. To address these challenges,
we propose practical co-design methodologies grounded in strategic exploration,
Sim2Real transfer, and meta-policy learning. We further argue for the essential
role of co-design by analyzing it from methodological, application-driven, and
community-oriented perspectives. Striving to guide and inspire future studies,
we present open research questions, spanning from short-term innovations to
long-term goals. This work positions co-design as a cornerstone for developing
the next generation of intelligent and adaptable humanoid agents.

Motivation: 微型飞行机器人在搜救、安全检查和环境监测方面具有巨大潜力，但小尺寸限制了传统传感能力，特别是在光线差、烟雾、灰尘或反光障碍物环境中。

Method: 受自然界启发，采用基于气压计的胡须传感器检测障碍物位置，开发了触觉深度估计方法，在192KB RAM微控制器上实现完全机载自主触觉飞行。

Result: 系统实现了亚6毫米精度的触觉深度估计，使无人机能够在完全黑暗中仅通过触觉导航、沿障碍物轮廓飞行和探索受限空间，支持软性和刚性表面。

Conclusion: 这种仿生方法重新定义了无视觉导航，为微型飞行器在极端环境中应用开辟了新可能性。

Abstract: Tiny flying robots hold great potential for search-and-rescue, safety
inspections, and environmental monitoring, but their small size limits
conventional sensing-especially with poor-lighting, smoke, dust or reflective
obstacles. Inspired by nature, we propose a lightweight, 3.2-gram,
whisker-based tactile sensing apparatus for tiny drones, enabling them to
navigate and explore through gentle physical interaction. Just as rats and
moles use whiskers to perceive surroundings, our system equips drones with
tactile perception in flight, allowing obstacle sensing even in pitch-dark
conditions. The apparatus uses barometer-based whisker sensors to detect
obstacle locations while minimising destabilisation. To address sensor noise
and drift, we develop a tactile depth estimation method achieving sub-6 mm
accuracy. This enables drones to navigate, contour obstacles, and explore
confined spaces solely through touch-even in total darkness along both soft and
rigid surfaces. Running fully onboard a 192-KB RAM microcontroller, the system
supports autonomous tactile flight and is validated in both simulation and
real-world tests. Our bio-inspired approach redefines vision-free navigation,
opening new possibilities for micro aerial vehicles in extreme environments.

Result: 该框架能够提供数据驱动的稳定性保证，即使在不了解内部控制算法的情况下也能验证机器人系统的安全性

Conclusion: 该方法为动态现实环境中机器人系统的安全认证提供了一种鲁棒方法，且工具已开源

Abstract: Stability certificates play a critical role in ensuring the safety and
reliability of robotic systems. However, deriving these certificates for
complex, unknown systems has traditionally required explicit knowledge of
system dynamics, often making it a daunting task. This work introduces a novel
framework that learns a Lyapunov function directly from trajectory data,
enabling the certification of stability for autonomous systems without needing
detailed system models. By parameterizing the Lyapunov candidate using a neural
network and ensuring positive definiteness through Cholesky factorization, our
approach automatically identifies whether the system is stable under the given
trajectory. To address the challenges posed by noisy, real-world data, we allow
for controlled violations of the stability condition, focusing on maintaining
high confidence in the stability certification process. Our results demonstrate
that this framework can provide data-driven stability guarantees, offering a
robust method for certifying the safety of robotic systems in dynamic,
real-world environments. This approach works without access to the internal
control algorithms, making it applicable even in situations where system
behavior is opaque or proprietary. The tool for learning the stability proof is
open-sourced by this research: https://github.com/HansOersted/stability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉导航策略难以像激光雷达或深度图那样显式建模，需要智能模型和大规模数据，因此利用视觉-语言-动作模型的智能从合成专家数据学习导航能力。

Method: 基于预训练大语言模型和视觉基础模型实现多视角VLA模型MM-Nav，从三个具有特权深度信息的RL专家收集数据，动态平衡训练比例进行迭代训练。

Result: 在合成环境中展现出强泛化能力，学生VLA模型超越RL教师，体现了多能力整合的协同效应，真实世界实验进一步验证了有效性。

Conclusion: MM-Nav模型成功通过师生学习整合多种导航能力，在复杂环境中表现出优越性能，为视觉导航提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Visual navigation policy is widely regarded as a promising direction, as it
mimics humans by using egocentric visual observations for navigation. However,
optical information of visual observations is difficult to be explicitly
modeled like LiDAR point clouds or depth maps, which subsequently requires
intelligent models and large-scale data. To this end, we propose to leverage
the intelligence of the Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model to learn diverse
navigation capabilities from synthetic expert data in a teacher-student manner.
Specifically, we implement the VLA model, MM-Nav, as a multi-view VLA (with 360
observations) based on pretrained large language models and visual foundation
models. For large-scale navigation data, we collect expert data from three
reinforcement learning (RL) experts trained with privileged depth information
in three challenging tailor-made environments for different navigation
capabilities: reaching, squeezing, and avoiding. We iteratively train our VLA
model using data collected online from RL experts, where the training ratio is
dynamically balanced based on performance on individual capabilities. Through
extensive experiments in synthetic environments, we demonstrate that our model
achieves strong generalization capability. Moreover, we find that our student
VLA model outperforms the RL teachers, demonstrating the synergistic effect of
integrating multiple capabilities. Extensive real-world experiments further
confirm the effectiveness of our method.

Motivation: 针对电力巡检等场景中无人机需要在复杂环境中平滑覆盖所有兴趣点的需求，解决传统方法在轨迹平滑性和避障方面的不足。

Method: 两阶段方法：前端使用遗传算法求解TSP生成访问序列，后端将轨迹平滑度、时间消耗和避障约束建模为非线性最小二乘问题进行优化。

Conclusion: 该算法能够有效解决无人机在复杂环境中的平滑覆盖轨迹规划问题，满足实际应用需求。

Abstract: For typical applications of UAVs in power grid scenarios, we construct the
problem as planning UAV trajectories for coverage in cluttered environments. In
this paper, we propose an optimal smooth coverage trajectory planning
algorithm. The algorithm consists of two stages. In the front-end, a Genetic
Algorithm (GA) is employed to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) for
Points of Interest (POIs), generating an initial sequence of optimized visiting
points. In the back-end, the sequence is further optimized by considering
trajectory smoothness, time consumption, and obstacle avoidance. This is
formulated as a nonlinear least squares problem and solved to produce a smooth
coverage trajectory that satisfies these constraints. Numerical simulations
validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, ensuring UAVs can
smoothly cover all POIs in cluttered environments.

TL;DR: VLMFP是一个双VLM引导的框架，能够自主生成PDDL问题文件和领域文件，解决视觉语言模型在空间推理和长时规划中的局限性，同时结合PDDL规划器的形式化规划优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在视觉规划方面有潜力，但难以进行精确的空间和长时推理；而PDDL规划器擅长形式化规划，但无法解释视觉输入。现有方法需要人工预定义领域文件或依赖环境访问进行优化。

Method: 提出VLMFP框架，使用两个VLM：SimVLM基于输入规则描述模拟动作结果，GenVLM通过比较PDDL和SimVLM执行结果来生成和迭代优化PDDL文件。

Result: 在6个网格世界领域测试中，SimVLM对可见和未见外观的场景描述准确率分别为95.5%和82.6%，动作序列模拟准确率分别为85.5%和87.8%。VLMFP对未见实例的有效规划生成率达到70.0%（可见外观）和54.1%（未见外观）。

Conclusion: VLMFP能够自主生成PDDL问题文件和领域文件，在多个层面实现泛化能力，为视觉规划问题提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) show strong potential for visual planning but
struggle with precise spatial and long-horizon reasoning. In contrast, Planning
Domain Definition Language (PDDL) planners excel at long-horizon formal
planning, but cannot interpret visual inputs. Recent works combine these
complementary advantages by enabling VLMs to turn visual planning problems into
PDDL files for formal planning. However, while VLMs can generate PDDL problem
files satisfactorily, they struggle to accurately generate the PDDL domain
files, which describe all the planning rules. As a result, prior methods rely
on human experts to predefine domain files or on constant environment access
for refinement. We propose VLMFP, a Dual-VLM-guided framework that can
autonomously generate both PDDL problem and domain files for formal visual
planning. VLMFP introduces two VLMs to ensure reliable PDDL file generation: A
SimVLM that simulates action consequences based on input rule descriptions, and
a GenVLM that generates and iteratively refines PDDL files by comparing the
PDDL and SimVLM execution results. VLMFP unleashes multiple levels of
generalizability: The same generated PDDL domain file works for all the
different instances under the same problem, and VLMs generalize to different
problems with varied appearances and rules. We evaluate VLMFP with 6 grid-world
domains and test its generalization to unseen instances, appearance, and game
rules. On average, SimVLM accurately describes 95.5%, 82.6% of scenarios,
simulates 85.5%, 87.8% of action sequence, and judges 82.4%, 85.6% goal
reaching for seen and unseen appearances, respectively. With the guidance of
SimVLM, VLMFP can generate PDDL files to reach 70.0%, 54.1% valid plans for
unseen instances in seen and unseen appearances, respectively. Project page:

Conclusion: 数据增强技术能有效提升极值预测性能，不同模型在不同数据类型下具有互补优势，SMOTE方法在整体适应性方面表现最佳。

Abstract: Data augmentation with generative adversarial networks (GANs) has been
popular for class imbalance problems, mainly for pattern classification and
computer vision-related applications. Extreme value forecasting is a
challenging field that has various applications from finance to climate change
problems. In this study, we present a data augmentation framework for extreme
value forecasting. In this framework, our focus is on forecasting extreme
values using deep learning models in combination with data augmentation models
such as GANs and synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE). We use deep
learning models such as convolutional long short-term memory (Conv-LSTM) and
bidirectional long short-term memory (BD-LSTM) networks for multistep ahead
prediction featuring extremes. We investigate which data augmentation models
are the most suitable, taking into account the prediction accuracy overall and
at extreme regions, along with computational efficiency. We also present novel
strategies for incorporating data augmentation, considering extreme values
based on a relevance function. Our results indicate that the SMOTE-based
strategy consistently demonstrated superior adaptability, leading to improved
performance across both short- and long-horizon forecasts. Conv-LSTM and
BD-LSTM exhibit complementary strengths: the former excels in periodic, stable
datasets, while the latter performs better in chaotic or non-stationary

Conclusion: OpenTSLM成功地将时间序列作为原生模态集成到LLMs中，显著提升了时间序列推理能力，为医疗领域的数字健康应用提供了有力工具。所有代码、数据集和模型都已开源。

Abstract: LLMs have emerged as powerful tools for interpreting multimodal data. In
medicine, they hold particular promise for synthesizing large volumes of
clinical information into actionable insights and digital health applications.
Yet, a major limitation remains their inability to handle time series. To
overcome this gap, we present OpenTSLM, a family of Time Series Language Models
(TSLMs) created by integrating time series as a native modality to pretrained
LLMs, enabling reasoning over multiple time series of any length. We
investigate two architectures for OpenTSLM. The first, OpenTSLM-SoftPrompt,
models time series implicitly by concatenating learnable time series tokens
with text tokens via soft prompting. Although parameter-efficient, we
hypothesize that explicit time series modeling scales better and outperforms
implicit approaches. We thus introduce OpenTSLM-Flamingo, which integrates time
series with text via cross-attention. We benchmark both variants against
baselines that treat time series as text tokens or plots, across a suite of
text-time-series Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning tasks. We introduce three
datasets: HAR-CoT, Sleep-CoT, and ECG-QA-CoT. Across all, OpenTSLM models
outperform baselines, reaching 69.9 F1 in sleep staging and 65.4 in HAR,
compared to 9.05 and 52.2 for finetuned text-only models. Notably, even
1B-parameter OpenTSLM models surpass GPT-4o (15.47 and 2.95). OpenTSLM-Flamingo
matches OpenTSLM-SoftPrompt in performance and outperforms on longer sequences,
while maintaining stable memory requirements. By contrast, SoftPrompt grows
exponentially in memory with sequence length, requiring around 110 GB compared
to 40 GB VRAM when training on ECG-QA with LLaMA-3B. Expert reviews by
clinicians find strong reasoning capabilities exhibited by OpenTSLMs on ECG-QA.
To facilitate further research, we provide all code, datasets, and models
open-source.

TL;DR: RainSeer是一个结构感知的降雨场重建框架，利用雷达反射率作为物理结构先验，通过两阶段物理信息架构解决雷达体积场到稀疏点观测的转换问题，显著提升了降雨场重建的结构保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有空间插值方法在重建高分辨率降雨场时往往过度平滑关键结构，无法捕捉急剧变化和局地极端降雨。需要一种能够有效利用雷达观测的结构感知方法来改善降雨场重建质量。

Method: RainSeer采用物理信息两阶段架构：1) 结构到点映射器通过双向映射将中尺度雷达结构投影到局地地面降雨；2) 地理感知降雨解码器通过因果时空注意力机制捕捉水凝物下降过程中的语义转换（融化、蒸发等）。

Result: 在两个公共数据集（RAIN-F和MeteoNet）上的评估显示，RainSeer相比最先进基线方法，MAE降低了超过13.31%，并显著提升了重建降雨场的结构保真度。

Conclusion: RainSeer通过将雷达反射率重新解释为物理结构先验，成功解决了雷达体积场到稀疏点观测的转换挑战，为高分辨率降雨场重建提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Reconstructing high-resolution rainfall fields is essential for flood
forecasting, hydrological modeling, and climate analysis. However, existing
spatial interpolation methods-whether based on automatic weather station (AWS)
measurements or enhanced with satellite/radar observations often over-smooth
critical structures, failing to capture sharp transitions and localized
extremes. We introduce RainSeer, a structure-aware reconstruction framework
that reinterprets radar reflectivity as a physically grounded structural
prior-capturing when, where, and how rain develops. This shift, however,
introduces two fundamental challenges: (i) translating high-resolution
volumetric radar fields into sparse point-wise rainfall observations, and (ii)
bridging the physical disconnect between aloft hydro-meteors and ground-level
precipitation. RainSeer addresses these through a physics-informed two-stage
architecture: a Structure-to-Point Mapper performs spatial alignment by
projecting mesoscale radar structures into localized ground-level rainfall,
through a bidirectional mapping, and a Geo-Aware Rain Decoder captures the
semantic transformation of hydro-meteors through descent, melting, and
evaporation via a causal spatiotemporal attention mechanism. We evaluate
RainSeer on two public datasets-RAIN-F (Korea, 2017-2019) and MeteoNet (France,
2016-2018)-and observe consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines,
reducing MAE by over 13.31% and significantly enhancing structural fidelity in
reconstructed rainfall fields.

Motivation: 当前基础模型作为黑盒服务部署时，模型权重无法修改，只能通过提示进行定制。静态提示优化产生固定的单一提示，无法适应不同输入、用户或环境的变化。

Method: 使用强化学习训练轻量级参数化策略（Advisor Models），该策略能够根据环境反馈动态生成自然语言指导指令，在上下文中引导黑盒模型的行为。

Conclusion: Advisor Models为黑盒系统提供了可学习的接口，其中顾问模型充当参数化、环境特定的记忆。通过Advisor Models动态优化黑盒模型是实现个性化和环境适应性AI的有前景方向。

Abstract: Foundation models are increasingly deployed as black-box services, where
model weights cannot be modified and customization is limited to prompting.
While static prompt optimization has shown promise, it produces a single fixed
prompt that fails to adapt to different inputs, users, or environments. We
introduce Advisor Models, lightweight parametric policies trained with
reinforcement learning to reactively issue natural language steering
instructions in-context to black-box models. The advisor is a second small
model that sits between the input and the model, shaping behavior on a
per-instance basis using reward signals from the environment. Across multiple
domains involving reasoning and personalization, we show that Advisor Models
outperform static prompt optimizers, discovering environment dynamics and
improving downstream task performance. We also demonstrate the generalizability
of advisors by transferring them across black-box models, as well as the
framework's ability to achieve specialization while retaining robustness to
out-of-distribution inputs. Viewed more broadly, Advisor Models provide a
learnable interface to black-box systems where the advisor acts as a
parametric, environment-specific memory. We argue that dynamic optimization of
black-box models via Advisor Models is a promising direction for enabling
personalization and environment-adaptable AI with frontier-level capabilities.

*Ashish Jha,Valentin Leplat,AH Phan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出基于预测市场的训练数据选择方法，通过市场机制自动整合多种信号，使用单一流动性参数控制选择集中度，在固定计算预算下实现多信号数据筛选的统一框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统训练数据选择方法需要手动组合多种异构信号（不确定性、稀有性、多样性等），且权重设置通常随意，缺乏系统性和理论保证。

Method: 使用成本函数预测市场（LMSR）为每个样本定价，信号作为交易者，通过价格-每令牌规则处理令牌预算，加入轻量级多样性头提高覆盖度，量化评估通过主题簇覆盖和有效样本大小。

Result: 在GSM8K上（60k令牌预算），市场方法在保持与强基线相当性能的同时减少种子方差，选择开销<0.1 GPU小时；在AGNews上（保留5-25%数据），市场方法在保持竞争力的准确率下提供更好的平衡性和稳定性。

Conclusion: 该框架在固定计算预算下统一了多信号数据筛选，适用于提示级推理和分类任务，提供了透明可解释的聚合机制。

Abstract: Selecting a small yet useful subset of training data is hard because signals
of example utility (uncertainty, rarity, diversity, etc.) are heterogeneous and
typically combined with ad hoc weights. We propose a market-based selector that
prices each example via a cost-function prediction market (LMSR), signals act
as traders, a single liquidity parameter controls concentration, and topic-wise
normalization stabilizes calibration. Token budgets are handled explicitly by a
price-per-token rule $\rho=p/\ell^{\gamma}$, with $\gamma$ exposing an
interpretable length bias; a lightweight diversity head improves coverage. We
quantify coverage via topic cluster coverage and effective sample size. On the
theory side, we show that LMSR implements a maximum-entropy aggregation with
exponential weighting and a convex objective, yielding transparent knobs for
aggregation strength. Empirically, on GSM8K (60k-token budget) the market with
diversity achieves parity with strong single-signal baselines while reducing
seed variance and incurring $<\!0.1$ GPU-hr selection overhead; on AGNews at
kept=5-25\% the market (with light balancing) delivers competitive accuracy
with improved balance and stability. The framework unifies multi-signal data
curation under fixed compute for prompt-level reasoning and classification.

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) has recently emerged as an effective tool
for reducing the computational complexity and memory usage of a neural network
by representing its weights and activations with lower precision. While this
paradigm has shown great success in lowering compute and storage costs, there
is the potential for drastic performance reduction depending upon the
distribution of inputs experienced in inference. When considering possible
deployment in safety-critical environments, it is important to investigate the
extent of potential performance reduction, and what characteristics of input
distributions may give rise to this reduction. In this work, we explore the
idea of extreme failure stemming from dynamic PTQ and formulate a knowledge
distillation and reinforcement learning task to learn a network and bit-width
policy pair such that catastrophic failure under quantization is analyzed in
terms of worst case potential. Our results confirm the existence of this
"detrimental" network-policy pair, with several instances demonstrating
performance reductions in the range of 10-65% in accuracy, compared to their
"robust" counterparts encountering a <2% decrease. From systematic
experimentation and analyses, we also provide an initial exploration into
points at highest vulnerability. While our results represent an initial step
toward understanding failure cases introduced by PTQ, our findings ultimately
emphasize the need for caution in real-world deployment scenarios. We hope this
work encourages more rigorous examinations of robustness and a greater emphasis
on safety considerations for future works within the broader field of deep
learning.

TL;DR: SAGE是一种流式数据子集选择方法，使用Frequent Directions草图在O(ℓD)内存中维护梯度几何，通过计算示例梯度与共识方向的对齐度来优先选择数据子集，实现高效训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代神经网络在大数据集上的训练计算和能耗密集，需要更高效的数据选择方法来减少训练成本。

Method: 使用Frequent Directions草图维护梯度几何，通过两遍扫描和GPU友好的流水线，计算示例梯度与共识方向的对齐度来选择数据子集，避免N×N成对相似性和显式N×ℓ梯度存储。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，SAGE使用较小的保持率预算进行训练，同时保持与全数据训练和最新子集选择基线相当的准确性，并减少端到端计算和峰值内存使用。

Conclusion: SAGE提供了一种实用的、恒定内存的替代方案，可与剪枝和模型压缩互补，实现高效训练。

Abstract: Training modern neural networks on large datasets is computationally and
energy intensive. We present SAGE, a streaming data-subset selection method
that maintains a compact Frequent Directions (FD) sketch of gradient geometry
in $O(\ell D)$ memory and prioritizes examples whose sketched gradients align
with a consensus direction. The approach eliminates $N \times N$ pairwise
similarities and explicit $N \times \ell$ gradient stores, yielding a simple
two-pass, GPU-friendly pipeline. Leveraging FD's deterministic approximation
guarantees, we analyze how agreement scoring preserves gradient energy within
the principal sketched subspace. Across multiple benchmarks, SAGE trains with
small kept-rate budgets while retaining competitive accuracy relative to
full-data training and recent subset-selection baselines, and reduces
end-to-end compute and peak memory. Overall, SAGE offers a practical,
constant-memory alternative that complements pruning and model compression for
efficient training.

TL;DR: 本文研究了一种基于不确定性的模型选择策略，用于优化生物分子效力预测的集成学习，通过选择预测不确定性最低的模型来提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 上下文学习器如TabPFN在生物分子效力预测中表现优异，但其性能对提供的上下文高度敏感。如何在没有真实标签的情况下选择最佳模型进行集成是一个开放性问题。

Method: 使用TabPFN模型结合简单序列特征，研究基于模型预测不确定性的选择策略，具体采用预测的区间分位数范围作为不确定性度量，选择平均IQR最低的模型进行集成。

Result: 在siRNA敲低效力任务中，TabPFN模型超越了专门的state-of-the-art预测器。模型预测的IQR与真实预测误差呈负相关，通过选择IQR最低的模型集成，性能优于朴素集成或使用单一模型。

Conclusion: 模型不确定性是一种强大的、无需标签的启发式方法，可用于优化生物分子效力预测的集成模型选择。

Abstract: In-context learners like TabPFN are promising for biomolecule efficacy
prediction, where established molecular feature sets and relevant experimental
results can serve as powerful contextual examples. However, their performance
is highly sensitive to the provided context, making strategies like post-hoc
ensembling of models trained on different data subsets a viable approach. An
open question is how to select the best models for the ensemble without access
to ground truth labels. In this study, we investigate an uncertainty-guided
strategy for model selection. We demonstrate on an siRNA knockdown efficacy
task that a TabPFN model using simple sequence-based features can surpass
specialized state-of-the-art predictors. We also show that the model's
predicted inter-quantile range (IQR), a measure of its uncertainty, has a
negative correlation with true prediction error. By selecting and averaging an
ensemble of models with the lowest mean IQR, we achieve superior performance
compared to naive ensembling or using a single model trained on all available
data. This finding highlights model uncertainty as a powerful, label-free
heuristic for optimizing biomolecule efficacy predictions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型训练存在训练时间长和能耗巨大的问题，现代模型需要数月计算时间和吉瓦时级别的电力消耗，亟需解决这些效率挑战。

Method: 结合架构改进和算法增强，针对transformer注意力机制和MLP层进行优化，最大化模型FLOPs利用率，同时保持与标准transformer实现的兼容性。

Result: 在3B和30B参数Llama模型上使用SlimPajama-627B数据集进行基准测试，显示训练吞吐量提升2-6倍，能耗降低55%-83%。

Conclusion: 这些优化方法具有模型和硬件无关性，可广泛应用于各种transformer架构，并能扩展到监督微调和直接偏好优化等后训练阶段。

Abstract: Training Large Language Models (LLMs) is plagued by long training times and
massive energy consumption, with modern models requiring months of computation
and gigawatt-hours of electricity. In light of these challenges,we introduce
Litespark, a novel pre-training framework that addresses these inefficiencies
through targeted optimizations to transformer attention and MLP layers. Our
approach combines architectural improvements with algorithmic enhancements to
maximize Model FLOPs Utilization (MFU) while maintaining compatibility with
standard transformer implementations. Comprehensive benchmarking on 3B and 30B
parameter Llama models using the SlimPajama-627B dataset demonstrates
substantial performance gains: 2x-6x training throughput improvement and
$55\%-83$% energy consumption reduction across multi-node H200 GPU clusters.
These optimizations are model- and hardware-agnostic, enabling broad
applicability across transformer architectures and extending to post-training
phases including supervised fine-tuning and direct preference optimization.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为ACF的对比学习方法，从高维观测中学习可独立控制的状态因子，解决了传统方法需要已知因子化表示的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统因子化MDP方法需要已知因子表示，而深度RL无法利用因子结构。需要一种能从高维观测中自动发现可控制因子的方法。

Method: 使用对比学习来发现可独立控制的潜在变量，利用动作稀疏性（每个动作只影响部分变量）和环境动态来提供对比训练数据。

Result: 在Taxi、FourRooms和MiniGrid-DoorKey三个基准测试中，ACF直接从像素观测恢复了真实可控因子，性能优于基线解耦算法。

Conclusion: ACF成功解决了从高维观测中发现可控因子的问题，为结合因子化MDP和深度RL提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Algorithms that exploit factored Markov decision processes are far more
sample-efficient than factor-agnostic methods, yet they assume a factored
representation is known a priori -- a requirement that breaks down when the
agent sees only high-dimensional observations. Conversely, deep reinforcement
learning handles such inputs but cannot benefit from factored structure. We
address this representation problem with Action-Controllable Factorization
(ACF), a contrastive learning approach that uncovers independently controllable
latent variables -- state components each action can influence separately. ACF
leverages sparsity: actions typically affect only a subset of variables, while
the rest evolve under the environment's dynamics, yielding informative data for
contrastive training. ACF recovers the ground truth controllable factors
directly from pixel observations on three benchmarks with known factored
structure -- Taxi, FourRooms, and MiniGrid-DoorKey -- consistently
outperforming baseline disentanglement algorithms.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合深度强化学习(DRL)和有界极值搜索(ES)的混合控制器，用于提高非线性时变系统的鲁棒性。DRL利用历史数据快速控制多参数系统，而ES确保对时变性的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DRL在处理时变系统时性能会急剧下降，而ES虽然能处理时变系统但收敛速度慢且容易陷入局部最优。将两者结合可以发挥各自优势。

Method: 开发了DRL和有界ES的混合控制器，DRL负责快速控制多参数系统到期望设定点，ES确保对时变性的鲁棒性。

Result: 混合控制器的性能超过了单独使用DRL或ES的效果，在洛斯阿拉莫斯中子科学中心直线粒子加速器的低能束流传输段自动调谐中进行了数值研究。

Conclusion: DRL和有界ES的结合产生了协同效应，混合控制器既保持了DRL的快速学习能力，又具备了ES对时变系统的鲁棒性。

Abstract: In this paper, we study the use of robust model independent bounded extremum
seeking (ES) feedback control to improve the robustness of deep reinforcement
learning (DRL) controllers for a class of nonlinear time-varying systems. DRL
has the potential to learn from large datasets to quickly control or optimize
the outputs of many-parameter systems, but its performance degrades
catastrophically when the system model changes rapidly over time. Bounded ES
can handle time-varying systems with unknown control directions, but its
convergence speed slows down as the number of tuned parameters increases and,
like all local adaptive methods, it can get stuck in local minima. We
demonstrate that together, DRL and bounded ES result in a hybrid controller
whose performance exceeds the sum of its parts with DRL taking advantage of
historical data to learn how to quickly control a many-parameter system to a
desired setpoint while bounded ES ensures its robustness to time variations. We
present a numerical study of a general time-varying system and a combined
ES-DRL controller for automatic tuning of the Low Energy Beam Transport section
at the Los Alamos Neutron Science Center linear particle accelerator.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文揭示了监督微调(SFT)与逆强化学习的基本等价性，证明SFT不仅学习策略，还学习隐式的密集奖励模型，并提出了从SFT模型中恢复密集奖励信号的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战传统观点，即SFT只是简单的模仿学习过程，旨在证明SFT实际上是一种强大的奖励学习机制。

Method: 建立SFT与逆Q学习的等价性，提出基线相对奖励函数来从SFT模型中恢复密集奖励信号，并开发Dense-Path REINFORCE方法。

Result: Dense-Path REINFORCE在指令跟随基准测试中持续优于原始SFT模型。

Conclusion: 重新定义SFT不仅是策略模仿，更是强大的奖励学习机制，为利用专家演示开辟了新可能性。

Abstract: Conventionally, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is treated as a simple imitation
learning process that only trains a policy to imitate expert behavior on
demonstration datasets. In this work, we challenge this view by establishing a
fundamental equivalence between SFT and Inverse Reinforcement Learning. We
prove that the SFT objective is a special case of Inverse Q-Learning, which
implies that the SFT process does not just learn a policy, but also an
implicit, dense, token-level reward model that explains the expert
demonstrations. We then show how to recover this dense reward signal directly
from the SFT model by formulating a baseline-relative reward function. The
availability of such a dense reward model offers numerous benefits, providing
granular credit assignment for each token generated. We demonstrate one key
application by using these recovered rewards to further improve the policy with
reinforcement learning. Our method, Dense-Path REINFORCE, consistently
outperforms the original SFT models on instruction-following benchmarks. This
work reframes SFT not merely as policy imitation but as a powerful reward
learning mechanism, opening new possibilities for leveraging expert
demonstrations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种残差学习框架，通过在多块交叉阵列上顺序学习来补偿低精度权重更新的残差误差，从而在有限状态设备上实现片上训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模拟内存计算加速器使用电阻交叉阵列直接在内存中进行深度神经网络计算，但实际训练需要至少8位电导状态才能匹配数字基线。许多有前景的忆阻设备（如ReRAM）由于制造限制仅提供约4位分辨率，这种有限的更新精度会显著降低训练精度。

Method: 采用残差学习框架，在多块交叉阵列瓦片上顺序学习，补偿低精度权重更新带来的残差误差。理论分析表明最优性差距随瓦片数量增加而缩小，并实现线性收敛速率。

Result: 在标准图像分类基准测试中，该方法在有限状态设置下始终优于最先进的模拟内存训练策略，成本分析证实仅产生适度的硬件开销。

Conclusion: 该残差学习框架能够有效解决有限状态忆阻设备的训练精度问题，为实际模拟内存计算系统的片上训练提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Analog in-memory computing (AIMC) accelerators enable efficient deep neural
network computation directly within memory using resistive crossbar arrays,
where model parameters are represented by the conductance states of memristive
devices. However, effective in-memory training typically requires at least
8-bit conductance states to match digital baselines. Realizing such
fine-grained states is costly and often requires complex noise mitigation
techniques that increase circuit complexity and energy consumption. In
practice, many promising memristive devices such as ReRAM offer only about
4-bit resolution due to fabrication constraints, and this limited update
precision substantially degrades training accuracy. To enable on-chip training
with these limited-state devices, this paper proposes a \emph{residual
learning} framework that sequentially learns on multiple crossbar tiles to
compensate the residual errors from low-precision weight updates. Our
theoretical analysis shows that the optimality gap shrinks with the number of
tiles and achieves a linear convergence rate. Experiments on standard image
classification benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art in-memory analog training strategies under limited-state
settings, while incurring only moderate hardware overhead as confirmed by our
cost analysis.

Motivation: 现有图生成方法通常只对齐谱或度分布，忽略了特征向量诱导的几何结构和图的全局结构。

Method: 使用谱特征映射将输入和目标图嵌入到连续黎曼流形中，定义嵌入间的测地流，并沿这些流匹配分布来生成输出图。

Result: 在多种基准测试中，SFMG在图元、度和谱指标上达到最先进方法的性能，同时比基于扩散的模型快30倍，并能泛化到未见过的图规模。

Conclusion: SFMG通过将谱几何与流匹配相结合，为图合成提供了一种新方法，具有几何结构捕捉、灵活生成和高效扩展等优势。

Abstract: Graph generation is a fundamental task with wide applications in modeling
complex systems. Although existing methods align the spectrum or degree profile
of the target graph, they often ignore the geometry induced by eigenvectors and
the global structure of the graph. In this work, we propose Spectral Geodesic
Flow Matching (SFMG), a novel framework that uses spectral eigenmaps to embed
both input and target graphs into continuous Riemannian manifolds. We then
define geodesic flows between embeddings and match distributions along these
flows to generate output graphs. Our method yields several advantages: (i)
captures geometric structure beyond eigenvalues, (ii) supports flexible
generation of diverse graphs, and (iii) scales efficiently. Empirically, SFMG
matches the performance of state-of-the-art approaches on graphlet, degree, and
spectral metrics across diverse benchmarks. In particular, it achieves up to
30$\times$ speedup over diffusion-based models, offering a substantial
advantage in scalability and training efficiency. We also demonstrate its
ability to generalize to unseen graph scales. Overall, SFMG provides a new
approach to graph synthesis by integrating spectral geometry with flow
matching.

Motivation: 目前缺乏比较模型激活与大脑响应的共识方法，需要一种原则性的比较方法来评估神经网络模型作为大脑机制模型的准确性。

Method: 使用IATC方法，通过识别动物群体中准确映射神经响应的最严格函数集，双向映射模型响应与大脑数据，评估模型能否作为典型受试者的替代。

Result: IATC能够解析神经机制的详细方面（如非线性激活函数），实现神经活动的高精度预测，同时获得机制识别的高特异性，能够区分不同脑区的响应模式。

Conclusion: IATC证明模型-大脑预测性与机制识别准确性之间不存在固有权衡，为深度神经网络作为视觉系统模型提供了新证据，改进了模型-大脑比较方法。

Abstract: Artificial neural network models have emerged as promising mechanistic models
of the brain. However, there is little consensus on the correct method for
comparing model activations to brain responses. Drawing on recent work in
philosophy of neuroscience, we propose a comparison methodology based on the
Inter-Animal Transform Class (IATC) - the strictest set of functions needed to
accurately map neural responses between subjects in an animal population. Using
the IATC, we can map bidirectionally between a candidate model's responses and
brain data, assessing how well the model can masquerade as a typical subject
using the same kinds of transforms needed to map across real subjects. We
identify the IATC in three settings: a simulated population of neural network
models, a population of mouse subjects, and a population of human subjects. We
find that the IATC resolves detailed aspects of the neural mechanism, such as
the non-linear activation function. Most importantly, we find that the IATC
enables accurate predictions of neural activity while also achieving high
specificity in mechanism identification, evidenced by its ability to separate
response patterns from different brain areas while strongly aligning
same-brain-area responses between subjects. In other words, the IATC is a
proof-by-existence that there is no inherent tradeoff between the neural
engineering goal of high model-brain predictivity and the neuroscientific goal
of identifying mechanistically accurate brain models. Using IATC-guided
transforms, we obtain new evidence in favor of topographical deep neural
networks (TDANNs) as models of the visual system. Overall, the IATC enables
principled model-brain comparisons, contextualizing previous findings about the
predictive success of deep learning models of the brain, while improving upon
previous approaches to model-brain comparison.

Abstract: In this study, we present AttentiveGRUAE, a novel attention-based gated
recurrent unit (GRU) autoencoder designed for temporal clustering and
prediction of outcome from longitudinal wearable data. Our model jointly
optimizes three objectives: (1) learning a compact latent representation of
daily behavioral features via sequence reconstruction, (2) predicting
end-of-period depression rate through a binary classification head, and (3)
identifying behavioral subtypes through Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) based soft
clustering of learned embeddings. We evaluate AttentiveGRUAE on longitudinal
sleep data from 372 participants (GLOBEM 2018-2019), and it demonstrates
superior performance over baseline clustering, domain-aligned self-supervised,
and ablated models in both clustering quality (silhouette score = 0.70 vs
0.32-0.70) and depression classification (AUC = 0.74 vs 0.50-0.67).
Additionally, external validation on cross-year cohorts from 332 participants
(GLOBEM 2020-2021) confirms cluster reproducibility (silhouette score = 0.63,
AUC = 0.61) and stability. We further perform subtype analysis and visualize
temporal attention, which highlights sleep-related differences between clusters
and identifies salient time windows that align with changes in sleep

Abstract: Despite significant advances in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), their limited
expressivity remains a fundamental challenge. Research on GNN expressivity has
produced many expressive architectures, leading to architecture hierarchies
with models of increasing expressive power. Separately, derivatives of GNNs
with respect to node features have been widely studied in the context of the
oversquashing and over-smoothing phenomena, GNN explainability, and more. To
date, these derivatives remain unexplored as a means to enhance GNN
expressivity. In this paper, we show that these derivatives provide a natural
way to enhance the expressivity of GNNs. We introduce High-Order Derivative GNN
(HOD-GNN), a novel method that enhances the expressivity of Message Passing
Neural Networks (MPNNs) by leveraging high-order node derivatives of the base
model. These derivatives generate expressive structure-aware node embeddings
processed by a second GNN in an end-to-end trainable architecture.
Theoretically, we show that the resulting architecture family's expressive
power aligns with the WL hierarchy. We also draw deep connections between
HOD-GNN, Subgraph GNNs, and popular structural encoding schemes. For
computational efficiency, we develop a message-passing algorithm for computing
high-order derivatives of MPNNs that exploits graph sparsity and parallelism.
Evaluations on popular graph learning benchmarks demonstrate HOD-GNN's strong
performance on popular graph learning tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning have been supported by the emergence of
domain-specific software libraries, enabling streamlined workflows and
increased reproducibility. For geospatial machine learning (GeoML), the
availability of Earth observation data has outpaced the development of domain
libraries to handle its unique challenges, such as varying spatial resolutions,
spectral properties, temporal cadence, data coverage, coordinate systems, and

libraries, analyzing their evolution, core functionalities, and the current
ecosystem. It also introduces popular GeoML libraries such as TorchGeo,
eo-learn, and Raster Vision, detailing their architecture, supported data
types, and integration with ML frameworks. Additionally, it discusses common
methodologies for data preprocessing, spatial--temporal joins, benchmarking,
and the use of pretrained models. Through a case study in crop type mapping, it
demonstrates practical applications of these tools. Best practices in software
design, licensing, and testing are highlighted, along with open challenges and
future directions, particularly the rise of foundation models and the need for

TL;DR: MINTO是一种新的深度强化学习方法，通过在目标网络和在线网络之间选择最小值作为目标估计，实现了快速稳定的价值函数学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目标网络虽然稳定但学习缓慢，而直接使用在线网络作为目标会导致学习不稳定。MINTO旨在结合两者的优点，实现快速且稳定的学习。

Method: 引入新的更新规则，使用目标网络和在线网络之间的最小值作为目标估计，可以无缝集成到各种基于价值和演员-评论家算法中。

Result: 在多种基准测试中，包括在线和离线强化学习以及离散和连续动作空间，MINTO始终提升性能表现。

Conclusion: MINTO通过简单而有效的修改，能够缓解使用在线网络进行自助引导时可能出现的过高估计偏差，展示了广泛的适用性和有效性。

Abstract: The use of target networks is a popular approach for estimating value
functions in deep Reinforcement Learning (RL). While effective, the target
network remains a compromise solution that preserves stability at the cost of
slowly moving targets, thus delaying learning. Conversely, using the online
network as a bootstrapped target is intuitively appealing, albeit well-known to
lead to unstable learning. In this work, we aim to obtain the best out of both
worlds by introducing a novel update rule that computes the target using the
MINimum estimate between the Target and Online network, giving rise to our
method, MINTO. Through this simple, yet effective modification, we show that
MINTO enables faster and stable value function learning, by mitigating the
potential overestimation bias of using the online network for bootstrapping.
Notably, MINTO can be seamlessly integrated into a wide range of value-based
and actor-critic algorithms with a negligible cost. We evaluate MINTO
extensively across diverse benchmarks, spanning online and offline RL, as well
as discrete and continuous action spaces. Across all benchmarks, MINTO
consistently improves performance, demonstrating its broad applicability and
effectiveness.

Abstract: While many modern studies are dedicated to ML-based large-sample hydrologic
modeling, these efforts have not necessarily translated into predictive
improvements that are grounded in enhanced physical-conceptual understanding.
Here, we report on a CONUS-wide large-sample study (spanning diverse
hydro-geo-climatic conditions) using ML-augmented physically-interpretable
catchment-scale models of varying complexity based in the Mass-Conserving
Perceptron (MCP). Results were evaluated using attribute masks such as snow
regime, forest cover, and climate zone. Our results indicate the importance of
selecting model architectures of appropriate model complexity based on how
process dominance varies with hydrological regime. Benchmark comparisons show
that physically-interpretable mass-conserving MCP-based models can achieve
performance comparable to data-based models based in the Long Short-Term Memory
network (LSTM) architecture. Overall, this study highlights the potential of a
theory-informed, physically grounded approach to large-sample hydrology, with
emphasis on mechanistic understanding and the development of parsimonious and
interpretable model architectures, thereby laying the foundation for future
models of everywhere that architecturally encode information about spatially-
and temporally-varying process dominance.

Conclusion: MINERVA方法能够有效处理传统方法难以捕捉的高阶特征交互，在特征选择任务中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Existing feature filters rely on statistical pair-wise dependence metrics to
model feature-target relationships, but this approach may fail when the target
depends on higher-order feature interactions rather than individual
contributions. We introduce Mutual Information Neural Estimation Regularized
Vetting Algorithm (MINERVA), a novel approach to supervised feature selection
based on neural estimation of mutual information between features and targets.
We paramaterize the approximation of mutual information with neural networks
and perform feature selection using a carefully designed loss function
augmented with sparsity-inducing regularizers. Our method is implemented in a
two-stage process to decouple representation learning from feature selection,
ensuring better generalization and a more accurate expression of feature
importance. We present examples of ubiquitous dependency structures that are
rarely captured in literature and show that our proposed method effectively
captures these complex feature-target relationships by evaluating feature
subsets as an ensemble. Experimental results on synthetic and real-life fraud
datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our method and its ability to perform
exact solutions.

Abstract: Missing data is a pervasive problem in tabular settings. Existing solutions
range from simple averaging to complex generative adversarial networks.
However, due to huge variance in performance across real-world domains and
time-consuming hyperparameter tuning, no default imputation method exists.
Building on TabPFN, a recent tabular foundation model for supervised learning,
we propose TabImpute, a pre-trained transformer that delivers accurate and fast
zero-shot imputations requiring no fitting or hyperparameter tuning at
inference-time. To train and evaluate TabImpute, we introduce (i) an entry-wise
featurization for tabular settings, which enables a $100\times$ speedup over
the previous TabPFN imputation method, (ii) a synthetic training data
generation pipeline incorporating realistic missingness patterns, which boosts
test-time performance, and (iii) MissBench, a comprehensive benchmark for
evaluation of imputation methods with $42$ OpenML datasets and $13$ missingness
patterns. MissBench spans domains such as medicine, finance, and engineering,
showcasing TabImpute's robust performance compared to $11$ established
imputation methods.

Conclusion: HyperAdaLoRA通过超网络机制有效加速了AdaLoRA的收敛，为参数高效微调提供了一种高效的解决方案，具有广泛的适用性。

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT), especially Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA), has emerged as a promising approach to fine-tuning large language
models(LLMs) while reducing computational and memory overhead. However, LoRA
assumes a uniform rank \textit{r} for each incremental matrix, not accounting
for the varying significance of weight matrices across different modules and
layers. AdaLoRA leverages Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to parameterize
updates and employs pruning of singular values to introduce dynamic rank
allocation, thereby enhancing adaptability. However, during the training
process, it often encounters issues of slow convergence speed and high
computational overhead. To address this issue, we propose HyperAdaLoRA, a novel
framework that accelerates the convergence of AdaLoRA by leveraging a
hypernetwork. Instead of directly optimizing the components of Singular Value
Decomposition $(P, \Lambda, Q)$, HyperAdaLoRA employs a hypernetwork based on
attention mechanisms to dynamically generate these parameters. By pruning the
outputs of the hypernetwork that generates the singular values, dynamic rank
allocation is achieved. Comprehensive experiments on various datasets and
models demonstrate that our method achieves faster convergence without
sacrificing performance. Additionally, further extension experiments on other
LoRA-based approaches validate the broad applicability of our method.

Motivation: 车载巡检方法中，车辆的机械和动态特性显著影响损伤检测性能，限制了该方法的有效性。

Method: 使用基于对抗自编码器(AAE)的无监督深度学习重建加速度响应，通过最小化健康与损伤状态下损伤指数分布的Wasserstein距离来优化车辆轮胎悬挂系统的质量和刚度参数，并采用Kriging元模型高效逼近目标函数。

Result: 结果显示，相对于桥梁第一固有频率，频率比在0.3-0.7之间的车辆检测效果最佳，而接近共振的车辆性能较差；较轻的车辆需要较低的固有频率以获得最优检测效果。

Conclusion: 这是首个严格优化车载传感平台的研究，并提出了专门设计的巡检车辆方案。

Abstract: Drive-by inspection for bridge health monitoring has gained increasing
attention over the past decade. This method involves analysing the coupled
vehicle-bridge response, recorded by an instrumented inspection vehicle, to
assess structural integrity and detect damage. However, the vehicles mechanical
and dynamic properties significantly influence detection performance, limiting
the effectiveness of the approach. This study presents a framework for
optimising the inspection vehicle to enhance damage sensitivity. An
unsupervised deep learning methodbased on adversarial autoencoders (AAE)is used
to reconstruct the frequency-domain representation of acceleration responses.
The mass and stiffness of the tyre suspension system of a two-axle vehicle are
optimised by minimising the Wasserstein distance between damage index
distributions for healthy and damaged bridge states. A Kriging meta-model is
employed to approximate this objective function efficiently and identify
optimal vehicle configurations in both dimensional and non-dimensional
parameter spaces. Results show that vehicles with frequency ratios between 0.3
and 0.7 relative to the bridges' first natural frequency are most effective,
while those near resonance perform poorly. Lighter vehicles require lower
natural frequencies for optimal detection. This is the first study to
rigorously optimise the sensing platform for drive-by sensing and to propose a
purpose-built inspection vehicle.

Motivation: 随着学生越来越多地使用LLMs作为学习辅助工具，需要构建能够处理辅导细微差别的模型，包括识别学生核心需求、适应性、个性化指导和准确性。

Method: 创建包含1,490个高中和AP课程样本的数据集，每个样本配有特定评分标准，使用基于LLM-judge和样本特定评分标准的自动评估方法。

Result: 评估16个前沿LLMs，结果显示所有模型得分均低于56%，在辅导技能相关评分标准上的通过率低于60%。不同模型家族表现各异：Claude模型在支持主动学习方面表现最佳，但在其他两个用例中落后。

Conclusion: 前沿LLMs在展示完整辅导技能方面存在不足，TutorBench为下一代AI辅导系统的开发提供了全面且未饱和的基准。

Abstract: As students increasingly adopt large language models (LLMs) as learning aids,
it is crucial to build models that are adept at handling the nuances of
tutoring: they need to identify the core needs of students, be adaptive,
provide personalized guidance, and be accurate. To this end, we introduce
TutorBench, a dataset and evaluation benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate
the core tutoring skills of LLMs. The dataset comprises 1,490 samples curated
by human experts, focused on high-school and AP-level curricula. The samples
are drawn from three common tutoring tasks: (i) generating adaptive
explanations tailored to a student's confusion, (ii) providing actionable
feedback on a student's work, and (iii) promoting active learning through
effective hint generation. To account for the inherent complexity of tutoring,
samples are accompanied by sample-specific rubrics which are used to judge
model responses during evaluation. TutorBench uses a reliable and fine-grained
automatic evaluation method that uses an LLM-judge and the sample-specific
rubrics. We evaluate 16 frontier LLMs on TutorBench and present a detailed
analysis of their performance and behavior. Our results show that none of the
frontier LLMs achieve a score of greater than $56\%$, showing a large room for
improvement. We find that LLMs fall short in exhibiting the full range of
tutoring skills needed to guide, diagnose, and support students effectively,
with all the frontier models achieving less than a $60\%$ pass rate on rubric
criteria related to these skills. We also find that different model families
exhibit varied strengths and limitations: the Claude models outperform others
in supporting active learning, while they lag behind in the other two use
cases. By releasing TutorBench, we provide a comprehensive and unsaturated
benchmark to guide the development of the next-generation of AI tutors.

TL;DR: 该论文证明，对于一类广泛的置换等变学习规则，训练过程在神经元之间诱导出双Lipschitz映射，并强烈约束神经元分布的拓扑结构。学习率存在一个拓扑临界点η*：低于η*时训练保持所有拓扑结构，高于η*时允许拓扑简化，降低模型表达能力。

Motivation: 研究深度学习训练过程中神经元分布的拓扑变化规律，揭示学习率对模型表达能力的影响机制，为理解神经网络学习动态提供新的理论视角。

Method: 通过分析置换等变学习规则（包括SGD、Adam等）在训练过程中诱导的双Lipschitz映射，研究神经元分布的拓扑约束和简化过程。

Result: 发现学习率存在拓扑临界点η*，低于该值时训练保持所有拓扑结构，高于该值时允许拓扑简化，使神经元流形逐渐粗糙化。结合边缘稳定性现象，学习动态可分为两个阶段：平滑优化阶段和拓扑简化阶段。

Conclusion: 该理论独立于具体架构或损失函数，使得拓扑方法能够普遍应用于深度学习研究，为理解神经网络学习机制提供了新的理论框架。

Abstract: We prove that for a broad class of permutation-equivariant learning rules
(including SGD, Adam, and others), the training process induces a bi-Lipschitz
mapping between neurons and strongly constrains the topology of the neuron
distribution during training. This result reveals a qualitative difference
between small and large learning rates $\eta$. With a learning rate below a
topological critical point $\eta^*$, the training is constrained to preserve
all topological structure of the neurons. In contrast, above $\eta^*$, the
learning process allows for topological simplification, making the neuron
manifold progressively coarser and thereby reducing the model's expressivity.
Viewed in combination with the recent discovery of the edge of stability
phenomenon, the learning dynamics of neuron networks under gradient descent can
be divided into two phases: first they undergo smooth optimization under
topological constraints, and then enter a second phase where they learn through
drastic topological simplifications. A key feature of our theory is that it is
independent of specific architectures or loss functions, enabling the universal
application of topological methods to the study of deep learning.

Abstract: The scaling of Generative AI (GenAI) models into the hundreds of billions of
parameters makes low-precision computation indispensable for efficient
deployment. We argue that the fundamental solution lies in developing
low-precision floating-point formats, which inherently provide numerical
stability, memory savings, and hardware efficiency without dequantization
overhead. In this paper, we present a theoretical and empirical study of an
exponent concentration phenomenon in GenAI weights: exponents consistently
exhibit low entropy across architectures and modalities. We show that this
arises naturally from $\alpha$-stable distributions induced by stochastic
gradient descent, and we prove tight bounds on the entropy of exponents. Our
analysis establishes a theoretical compression limit near FP4.67, which
motivates the design of a practical FP8 format. Building on these insights, we
propose Exponent-Concentrated FP8 (ECF8), a lossless compression framework with
entropy-aware encoding and GPU-optimized decoding. Experiments on LLMs and DiTs
up to 671B parameters demonstrate up to 26.9% memory savings and 177.1%
throughput acceleration, with perfectly lossless computations, i.e., no
deviation in model outputs. Our results establish exponent concentration as a
statistical law of trained models and open a principled path for lossless
low-precision floating-point design in the FP8 era.

Abstract: Recently, neural operators have emerged as powerful tools for learning
mappings between function spaces, enabling data-driven simulations of complex
dynamics. Despite their successes, a deeper understanding of their learning
mechanisms remains underexplored. In this work, we classify neural operators
into two types: (1) Spatial domain models that learn on grids and (2)
Functional domain models that learn with function bases. We present several
viewpoints based on this classification and focus on learning data-driven
dynamics adhering to physical principles. Specifically, we provide a way to
explain the prediction-making process of neural operators and show that neural
operator can learn hidden physical patterns from data. However, this
explanation method is limited to specific situations, highlighting the urgent
need for generalizable explanation methods. Next, we show that a simple
dual-space multi-scale model can achieve SOTA performance and we believe that
dual-space multi-spatio-scale models hold significant potential to learn
complex physics and require further investigation. Lastly, we discuss the
critical need for principled frameworks to incorporate known physics into
neural operators, enabling better generalization and uncovering more hidden
physical phenomena.

Abstract: Genetic programming (GP) has demonstrated strong effectiveness in evolving
tree-structured heuristics for complex optimization problems. Yet, in dynamic
and large-scale scenarios, the most effective heuristics are often highly
complex, hindering interpretability, slowing convergence, and limiting
transferability across tasks. To address these challenges, we present EvoSpeak,
a novel framework that integrates GP with large language models (LLMs) to
enhance the efficiency, transparency, and adaptability of heuristic evolution.
EvoSpeak learns from high-quality GP heuristics, extracts knowledge, and
leverages this knowledge to (i) generate warm-start populations that accelerate
convergence, (ii) translate opaque GP trees into concise natural-language
explanations that foster interpretability and trust, and (iii) enable knowledge
transfer and preference-aware heuristic generation across related tasks. We
verify the effectiveness of EvoSpeak through extensive experiments on dynamic
flexible job shop scheduling (DFJSS), under both single- and multi-objective
formulations. The results demonstrate that EvoSpeak produces more effective
heuristics, improves evolutionary efficiency, and delivers human-readable
reports that enhance usability. By coupling the symbolic reasoning power of GP
with the interpretative and generative strengths of LLMs, EvoSpeak advances the
development of intelligent, transparent, and user-aligned heuristics for
real-world optimization problems.

Conclusion: GRAFT框架有效解决了扩散模型分布塑造问题，P-GRAFT通过中间噪声级别优化提升了微调效果，逆噪声校正为流模型改进提供了新方向。

Abstract: Diffusion models are widely used for generative tasks across domains. While
pre-trained diffusion models effectively capture the training data
distribution, it is often desirable to shape these distributions using reward
functions to align with downstream applications. Policy gradient methods, such
as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), are widely used in the context of
autoregressive generation. However, the marginal likelihoods required for such
methods are intractable for diffusion models, leading to alternative proposals
and relaxations. In this context, we unify variants of Rejection sAmpling based
Fine-Tuning (RAFT) as GRAFT, and show that this implicitly performs PPO with
reshaped rewards. We then introduce P-GRAFT to shape distributions at
intermediate noise levels and demonstrate empirically that this can lead to
more effective fine-tuning. We mathematically explain this via a bias-variance
tradeoff. Motivated by this, we propose inverse noise correction to improve
flow models without leveraging explicit rewards. We empirically evaluate our
methods on text-to-image(T2I) generation, layout generation, molecule
generation and unconditional image generation. Notably, our framework, applied
to Stable Diffusion 2, improves over policy gradient methods on popular T2I
benchmarks in terms of VQAScore and shows an $8.81\%$ relative improvement over
the base model. For unconditional image generation, inverse noise correction
improves FID of generated images at lower FLOPs/image.

Conclusion: RAMAC框架成功解决了风险规避离线RL中表达性与安全性之间的权衡问题，为复杂多模态场景提供了有效的风险敏感学习方法。

Abstract: In safety-critical domains where online data collection is infeasible,
offline reinforcement learning (RL) offers an attractive alternative but only
if policies deliver high returns without incurring catastrophic lower-tail
risk. Prior work on risk-averse offline RL achieves safety at the cost of value
conservatism and restricted policy classes, whereas expressive policies are
only used in risk-neutral settings. Here, we address this gap by introducing
the \textbf{Risk-Aware Multimodal Actor-Critic (RAMAC)} framework, which
couples an \emph{expressive generative actor} with a distributional critic. The
RAMAC differentiates composite objective combining distributional risk and BC
loss through the generative path, achieving risk-sensitive learning in complex
multimodal scenarios. We instantiate RAMAC with diffusion and flow-matching
actors and observe consistent gains in $\mathrm{CVaR}_{0.1}$ while maintaining
strong returns on most Stochastic-D4RL tasks. Code:

to the susceptibility of drone networks to a wide range of cyberattacks.
Existing intrusion detection mechanisms often lack the adaptability,
efficiency, and generalizability required for the dynamic and resource
constrained environments in which drones operate. This paper proposes TSLT-Net,
a novel lightweight and unified Temporal Spatial Transformer based intrusion
detection system tailored specifically for drone networks. By leveraging self
attention mechanisms, TSLT-Net effectively models both temporal patterns and
spatial dependencies in network traffic, enabling accurate detection of diverse
intrusion types. The framework includes a streamlined preprocessing pipeline
and supports both multiclass attack classification and binary anomaly detection
within a single architecture. Extensive experiments conducted on the ISOT Drone
Anomaly Detection Dataset, consisting of more than 2.3 million labeled records,
demonstrate the superior performance of TSLT-Net with 99.99 percent accuracy in
multiclass detection and 100 percent in binary anomaly detection, while
maintaining a minimal memory footprint of only 0.04 MB and 9722 trainable
parameters. These results establish TSLT-Net as an effective and scalable
solution for real time drone cybersecurity, particularly suitable for
deployment on edge devices in mission critical UAV systems.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of the Internet of Things (IoT) has revolutionized modern
industries by enabling smart automation and real time connectivity. However,
this evolution has also introduced complex cybersecurity challenges due to the
heterogeneous, resource constrained, and distributed nature of these
environments. To address these challenges, this research presents CST AFNet, a
novel dual attention based deep learning framework specifically designed for
robust intrusion detection in IoT networks. The model integrates multi scale
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for spatial feature extraction,
Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Units (BiGRUs) for capturing temporal
dependencies, and a dual attention mechanism, channel and temporal attention,
to enhance focus on critical patterns in the data. The proposed method was
trained and evaluated on the Edge IIoTset dataset, a comprehensive and
realistic benchmark containing more than 2.2 million labeled instances spanning
15 attack types and benign traffic, collected from a seven layer industrial
testbed. Our proposed model achieves outstanding accuracy for both 15 attack
types and benign traffic. CST AFNet achieves 99.97 percent accuracy. Moreover,
this model demonstrates exceptional performance with macro averaged precision,
recall, and F1 score all above 99.3 percent. Experimental results show that CST
AFNet achieves superior detection accuracy, significantly outperforming
traditional deep learning models. The findings confirm that CST AFNet is a
powerful and scalable solution for real time cyber threat detection in complex
IoT and IIoT environments, paving the way for more secure, intelligent, and
adaptive cyber physical systems.

Abstract: Hyperparameters greatly impact models' capabilities; however, modern models
are too large for extensive search. Instead, researchers design recipes that
train well across scales based on their understanding of the hyperparameters.
Despite this importance, few tools exist for understanding the hyperparameter
loss surface. We discover novel structure in it and propose a new theory
yielding such tools. The loss surface is complex, but as you approach the
optimum simple structure emerges. It becomes characterized by a few basic
features, like its effective dimension and the best possible loss. To uncover
this asymptotic regime, we develop a novel technique based on random search.
Within this regime, the best scores from random search take on a new
distribution we discover. Its parameters are exactly the features defining the
loss surface in the asymptotic regime. From these features, we derive a new
asymptotic law for random search that can explain and extrapolate its
convergence. These new tools enable new analyses, such as confidence intervals
for the best possible performance or determining the effective number of
hyperparameters. We make these tools available at

Abstract: Deep time series forecasting has emerged as a booming direction in recent
years. Despite the exponential growth of community interests, researchers are
sometimes confused about the direction of their efforts due to minor
improvements on standard benchmarks. In this paper, we notice that, unlike
image recognition, whose well-acknowledged and realizable goal is 100%
accuracy, time series forecasting inherently faces a non-zero error lower bound
due to its partially observable and uncertain nature. To pinpoint the research
objective and release researchers from saturated tasks, this paper focuses on a
fundamental question: how to estimate the performance upper bound of deep time
series forecasting? Going beyond classical series-wise predictability metrics,
e.g., ADF test, we realize that the forecasting performance is highly related
to window-wise properties because of the sequence-to-sequence forecasting
paradigm of deep time series models. Based on rigorous statistical tests of
over 2,800 newly trained deep forecasters, we discover a significant
exponential relationship between the minimum forecasting error of deep models
and the complexity of window-wise series patterns, which is termed the accuracy
law. The proposed accuracy law successfully guides us to identify saturated
tasks from widely used benchmarks and derives an effective training strategy
for large time series models, offering valuable insights for future research.

Conclusion: 这是首个基于几何布朗运动、采用多重更新的生物启发生成模型，为生物一致性学习提供了新途径。

Abstract: Gradient descent has proven to be a powerful and effective technique for
optimization in numerous machine learning applications. Recent advances in
computational neuroscience have shown that learning in standard gradient
descent optimization formulation is not consistent with learning in biological
systems. This has opened up interesting avenues for building biologically
inspired learning techniques. One such approach is inspired by Dale's law,
which states that inhibitory and excitatory synapses do not swap roles during
the course of learning. The resulting exponential gradient descent optimization
scheme leads to log-normally distributed synaptic weights. Interestingly, the
density that satisfies the Fokker-Planck equation corresponding to the
stochastic differential equation (SDE) with geometric Brownian motion (GBM) is
the log-normal density. Leveraging this connection, we start with the SDE
governing geometric Brownian motion, and show that discretizing the
corresponding reverse-time SDE yields a multiplicative update rule, which
surprisingly, coincides with the sampling equivalent of the exponential
gradient descent update founded on Dale's law. Furthermore, we propose a new
formalism for multiplicative denoising score-matching, subsuming the loss
function proposed by Hyvaerinen for non-negative data. Indeed, log-normally
distributed data is positive and the proposed score-matching formalism turns
out to be a natural fit. This allows for training of score-based models for
image data and results in a novel multiplicative update scheme for sample
generation starting from a log-normal density. Experimental results on MNIST,
Fashion MNIST, and Kuzushiji datasets demonstrate generative capability of the
new scheme. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first instance of a
biologically inspired generative model employing multiplicative updates,
founded on geometric Brownian motion.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的鲁棒属性图聚类方法RAGC，通过混合协作增强和对比样本自适应差分感知来解决现有对比属性图聚类方法在边级增强和样本对处理方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对比属性图聚类方法主要依赖边作为辅助信息获取节点级嵌入表示，仅关注节点级增强，忽视了边级嵌入增强以及不同粒度下节点级和边级增强之间的交互作用。同时，它们往往平等对待所有对比样本对，忽略了难易正负样本对之间的显著差异，限制了判别能力。

Method: 提出RAGC方法，包含混合协作增强和对比样本自适应差分感知两个模块。HCA同时执行节点级和边级嵌入表示与增强，建立更全面的相似性度量标准；CSADA利用高置信度伪标签信息自适应识别所有对比样本对，并通过创新的权重调制函数进行差异化处理。两个模块在良性循环中相互促进。

Result: 在六个基准数据集上的综合图聚类评估表明，所提出的RAGC方法在多个最先进的CAGC方法中表现出有效性。

Conclusion: RAGC通过混合协作增强和对比样本自适应差分感知的协同作用，有效提升了表示学习的判别能力，在属性图聚类任务中取得了优异性能。

Abstract: Due to its powerful capability of self-supervised representation learning and
clustering, contrastive attributed graph clustering (CAGC) has achieved great
success, which mainly depends on effective data augmentation and contrastive
objective setting. However, most CAGC methods utilize edges as auxiliary
information to obtain node-level embedding representation and only focus on
node-level embedding augmentation. This approach overlooks edge-level embedding
augmentation and the interactions between node-level and edge-level embedding
augmentations across various granularity. Moreover, they often treat all
contrastive sample pairs equally, neglecting the significant differences
between hard and easy positive-negative sample pairs, which ultimately limits
their discriminative capability. To tackle these issues, a novel robust
attributed graph clustering (RAGC), incorporating hybrid-collaborative
augmentation (HCA) and contrastive sample adaptive-differential awareness
(CSADA), is proposed. First, node-level and edge-level embedding
representations and augmentations are simultaneously executed to establish a
more comprehensive similarity measurement criterion for subsequent contrastive
learning. In turn, the discriminative similarity further consciously guides
edge augmentation. Second, by leveraging pseudo-label information with high
confidence, a CSADA strategy is elaborately designed, which adaptively
identifies all contrastive sample pairs and differentially treats them by an
innovative weight modulation function. The HCA and CSADA modules mutually
reinforce each other in a beneficent cycle, thereby enhancing discriminability
in representation learning. Comprehensive graph clustering evaluations over six
benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed RAGC against
several state-of-the-art CAGC methods.

TL;DR: TokenFlow是一个新颖的LLM服务系统，通过抢占式请求调度和主动KV缓存管理来提升文本流式传输性能，显著提高了有效吞吐量并降低了首令牌延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实时LLM交互需要流式令牌生成，但现有系统由于非抢占式请求调度和被动内存管理导致资源利用率低、请求处理并行度差，特别是在请求突发时表现不佳。

Method: TokenFlow采用抢占式请求调度，基于实时令牌缓冲区占用率和令牌消耗率动态优先处理请求，同时主动在GPU和CPU内存间传输KV缓存，并通过I/O与计算重叠来最小化请求抢占开销。

Result: 在Llama3-8B和Qwen2.5-32B模型上的多GPU实验表明，TokenFlow实现了高达82.5%的有效吞吐量提升，P99首令牌时间降低达80.2%，且不降低整体令牌吞吐量。

Conclusion: TokenFlow通过创新的调度和缓存管理策略，显著提升了LLM流式服务的性能，平衡了响应性和稳定生成的需求。

Abstract: Real-time LLM interactions demand streamed token generations, where text
tokens are progressively generated and delivered to users while balancing two
objectives: responsiveness (i.e., low time-to-first-token) and steady
generation (i.e.,required time-between-tokens). Standard LLM serving systems
suffer from the inflexibility caused by non-preemptive request scheduling and
reactive memory management, leading to poor resource utilization and low
request processing parallelism under request bursts. Therefore, we present
TokenFlow, a novel LLM serving system with enhanced text streaming performance
via preemptive request scheduling and proactive key-value (KV) cache
management. TokenFlow dynamically prioritizes requests based on real-time token
buffer occupancy and token consumption rate, while actively transferring KV
cache between GPU and CPU memory in the background and overlapping I/O with
computation to minimize request preemption overhead. Extensive experiments on
Llama3-8B and Qwen2.5-32B across multiple GPUs (RTX 4090, A6000, H200)
demonstrate that TokenFlow achieves up to 82.5% higher effective throughput
(accounting for actual user consumption) while reducing P99 TTFT by up to
80.2%, without degrading overall token throughput.

Abstract: We present a self-supervised machine learning framework for detecting and

framework, called SIT-FUSE, generates HAB severity and speciation products
without requiring per-instrument labeled datasets. The framework employs
self-supervised representation learning, hierarchical deep clustering to
segment phytoplankton concentrations and speciations into interpretable
classes, validated against in-situ data from the Gulf of Mexico and Southern
California (2018-2025). Results show strong agreement with total phytoplankton,
Karenia brevis, Alexandrium spp., and Pseudo-nitzschia spp. measurements. This

enabling exploratory analysis via hierarchical embeddings: a critical step
toward operationalizing self-supervised learning for global aquatic

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Gradient-based algorithms are a cornerstone of artificial neural network
training, yet it remains unclear whether biological neural networks use similar
gradient-based strategies during learning. Experiments often discover a
diversity of synaptic plasticity rules, but whether these amount to an
approximation to gradient descent is unclear. Here we investigate a previously
overlooked possibility: that learning dynamics may include fundamentally
non-gradient "curl"-like components while still being able to effectively
optimize a loss function. Curl terms naturally emerge in networks with
inhibitory-excitatory connectivity or Hebbian/anti-Hebbian plasticity,
resulting in learning dynamics that cannot be framed as gradient descent on any
objective. To investigate the impact of these curl terms, we analyze
feedforward networks within an analytically tractable student-teacher
framework, systematically introducing non-gradient dynamics through neurons
exhibiting rule-flipped plasticity. Small curl terms preserve the stability of
the original solution manifold, resulting in learning dynamics similar to
gradient descent. Beyond a critical value, strong curl terms destabilize the
solution manifold. Depending on the network architecture, this loss of
stability can lead to chaotic learning dynamics that destroy performance. In
other cases, the curl terms can counterintuitively speed learning compared to
gradient descent by allowing the weight dynamics to escape saddles by
temporarily ascending the loss. Our results identify specific architectures
capable of supporting robust learning via diverse learning rules, providing an
important counterpoint to normative theories of gradient-based learning in
neural networks.

Abstract: Open-weight LLMs can be modified at inference time with simple activation
edits, which raises a practical question for safety: do common safety
interventions like refusal training or metatag training survive such edits? We
study model abliteration, a lightweight projection technique designed to remove
refusal-sensitive directions, and conduct a controlled evaluation across a
granular sequence of Safety Pretraining checkpoints for SmolLM2-1.7B, alongside
widely used open baselines. For each of 20 systems, original and abliterated,
we issue 100 prompts with balanced harmful and harmless cases, classify
responses as **Refusal** or **Non-Refusal** using multiple judges, and validate
judge fidelity on a small human-labeled subset. We also probe whether models
can identify refusal in their own outputs. Our study produces a
checkpoint-level characterization of which data-centric safety components
remain robust under abliteration, quantifies how judge selection influences
evaluation outcomes, and outlines a practical protocol for integrating
inference-time edits into safety assessments. Code:

Conclusion: 梯度下降方法在深度ReLU网络中能够实现接近最优的泛化性能，且对网络深度的依赖仅为多项式级别，而非指数级别。

Abstract: Recent advances have significantly improved our understanding of the
generalization performance of gradient descent (GD) methods in deep neural
networks. A natural and fundamental question is whether GD can achieve
generalization rates comparable to the minimax optimal rates established in the
kernel setting. Existing results either yield suboptimal rates of
$O(1/\sqrt{n})$, or focus on networks with smooth activation functions,
incurring exponential dependence on network depth $L$. In this work, we
establish optimal generalization rates for GD with deep ReLU networks by
carefully trading off optimization and generalization errors, achieving only
polynomial dependence on depth. Specifically, under the assumption that the
data are NTK separable from the margin $\gamma$, we prove an excess risk rate
of $\widetilde{O}(L^4 (1 + \gamma L^2) / (n \gamma^2))$, which aligns with the
optimal SVM-type rate $\widetilde{O}(1 / (n \gamma^2))$ up to depth-dependent
factors. A key technical contribution is our novel control of activation
patterns near a reference model, enabling a sharper Rademacher complexity bound
for deep ReLU networks trained with gradient descent.

Conclusion: 通过考虑预测区间的相关性而不仅仅是有效性，可以改进在线共形预测方法，产生更窄的预测区间。

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification has received considerable interest in recent works
in Machine Learning. In particular, Conformal Prediction (CP) gains ground in
this field. For the case of time series, Online Conformal Prediction (OCP)
becomes an option to address the problem of data distribution shift over time.
Indeed, the idea of OCP is to update a threshold of some quantity (whether the
miscoverage level or the quantile) based on the distribution observation. To
evaluate the performance of OCP methods, two key aspects are typically
considered: the coverage validity and the prediction interval width
minimization. Recently, new OCP methods have emerged, offering long-run
coverage guarantees and producing more informative intervals. However, during
the threshold update step, most of these methods focus solely on the validity
of the prediction intervals~--~that is, whether the ground truth falls inside
or outside the interval~--~without accounting for their relevance. In this
paper, we aim to leverage this overlooked aspect. Specifically, we propose
enhancing the threshold update step by replacing the binary evaluation
(inside/outside) with a broader class of functions that quantify the relevance
of the prediction interval using the ground truth. This approach helps prevent
abrupt threshold changes, potentially resulting in narrower prediction
intervals. Indeed, experimental results on real-world datasets suggest that
these functions can produce tighter intervals compared to existing OCP methods
while maintaining coverage validity.

Conclusion: 研究建立了详细的组件级能耗基准，为通过组件级优化构建节能transformer模型提供了初步见解，表明FLOP无法捕捉组件级真实能耗成本。

Abstract: The rapid adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) has raised significant
environmental concerns. Unlike the one-time cost of training, LLM inference
occurs continuously at a global scale and now dominates the AI energy
footprint. Yet, most sustainability studies report only coarse, model-level
metrics due to the lack of fine-grained measurement methods, treating energy
efficiency more as an afterthought than as a primary objective. We present the
first fine-grained empirical analysis of inference energy across core
components of transformer architecture. We propose a novel methodology,
Component-Level Energy Assessment via Repeated sampling (CLEAR), to overcome
temporal mismatch between microsecond scale component execution and monitoring
of millisecond (ms) scale energy sensors. Using CLEAR, we evaluate 15 models
spanning four distinct architecture types and consistently keep component-wise
energy variance below 9.5\% while capturing more than 90\% of the model's total
energy as individual components. Our empirical analysis reveals that Attention
blocks consume significantly more energy per floating-point operation (FLOP),
indicating that energy consumption is not proportionally aligned with FLOP
counts. This shows that FLOPs alone fail to capture the true energy cost at a
component level. Our findings establish detailed component-level energy
baselines and provide insight as an initial step to build energy-efficient
transformer models through component-level optimizations.

*Sung Ho Jo,Seonghwi Kim,Minwoo Chae*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出分层Group DRO方法，解决传统方法对组内分布偏移的脆弱性问题，特别是在少数群体中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统监督学习方法容易受到伪相关性的影响，特别是在测试数据分布偏移时。现有方法如Group DRO虽然对组间偏移有鲁棒性，但对组内分布偏移（尤其在样本有限的少数群体中）仍然脆弱。

Method: 提出分层扩展的Group DRO方法，同时处理组间和组内不确定性，并在多个层次上提供对分布偏移的鲁棒性。还引入了新的基准设置来模拟真实的少数群体分布偏移。

Result: 在现有鲁棒学习方法持续失败的情况下，该方法在这些条件下表现出强大的鲁棒性，同时在标准基准测试中也取得了优越性能。

Conclusion: 结果表明，扩展模糊集以更好地捕捉组间和组内分布不确定性非常重要，这为解决伪相关性研究中的关键挑战提供了新思路。

Abstract: Conventional supervised learning methods are often vulnerable to spurious
correlations, particularly under distribution shifts in test data. To address
this issue, several approaches, most notably Group DRO, have been developed.
While these methods are highly robust to subpopulation or group shifts, they
remain vulnerable to intra-group distributional shifts, which frequently occur
in minority groups with limited samples. We propose a hierarchical extension of
Group DRO that addresses both inter-group and intra-group uncertainties,
providing robustness to distribution shifts at multiple levels. We also
introduce new benchmark settings that simulate realistic minority group
distribution shifts-an important yet previously underexplored challenge in
spurious correlation research. Our method demonstrates strong robustness under
these conditions-where existing robust learning methods consistently fail-while
also achieving superior performance on standard benchmarks. These results
highlight the importance of broadening the ambiguity set to better capture both
inter-group and intra-group distributional uncertainties.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个通用模板，将随机学习算法适配到随机顺序模型，同时保持其遗憾保证，并应用于延迟预测、带约束的在线学习和带切换成本的赌博机等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随机顺序模型中的输入序列虽然渐近等价于独立同分布数据，但在有限时间内可能表现出显著的非平稳性，这会阻碍随机学习算法的性能。

Method: 提出了一个通用模板来适配随机学习算法到随机顺序模型，而不显著影响其遗憾保证。

Result: 恢复了延迟预测、带约束的在线学习和带切换成本的赌博机等问题的改进遗憾界，并证明在随机顺序模型中可学习性由VC维而非Littlestone维刻画。

Conclusion: 该工作提供了随机顺序模型与一般对抗模型的进一步分离，并为随机学习算法在该模型中的应用提供了有效方法。

Abstract: In the random-order model for online learning,
  the sequence of losses is chosen upfront by an adversary and presented to the
learner
  after a random permutation. Any random-order input is \emph{asymptotically}
equivalent to a stochastic i.i.d. one, but, for finite times, it may exhibit
significant {\em non-stationarity}, which can hinder the performance of
stochastic learning algorithms.
  While algorithms for adversarial inputs naturally maintain their regret
guarantees in random order, simple no-regret algorithms exist for the
stochastic model that fail against random-order instances.
  In this paper, we propose a general template to adapt stochastic learning
algorithms to the random-order model without substantially affecting their
regret guarantees. This allows us to recover improved regret bounds for
prediction with delays, online learning with constraints, and bandits with
switching costs. Finally, we investigate online classification and prove that,
in random order, learnability is characterized by the VC dimension rather than
the Littlestone dimension, thus providing a further separation from the general
adversarial model.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FlexiQ是一种自适应混合精度量化方案，通过选择性应用低比特计算到值范围小的特征通道，并实时调整低比特通道比例，有效处理推理工作负载波动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经网络通常在NPU和GPU等硬件加速器上运行，但这些加速器成本高且难以根据实时工作负载波动扩展资源。

Method: FlexiQ采用自适应混合精度量化，选择性地对值范围小的特征通道应用低比特计算，并使用高效的比特降低方法最小化量化误差，同时实时调整低比特通道比例。

Result: 在11个卷积和基于transformer的视觉模型上评估，FlexiQ在4位模型上平均精度提高6.6%，优于四种最先进的量化技术。50% 4位模型仅损失0.6%精度，达到100% 4位模型相对于8位模型40%的加速效果。

Conclusion: FlexiQ在NPU和GPU上引入最小运行时开销，证明了其硬件效率和整体性能优势，能够有效管理波动的推理工作负载。

Abstract: Neural networks commonly execute on hardware accelerators such as NPUs and
GPUs for their size and computation overhead. These accelerators are costly and
it is hard to scale their resources to handle real-time workload fluctuations.
  We present FlexiQ, an adaptive mixed-precision quantization scheme for
computer vision models. FlexiQ selectively applies low-bitwidth computation to
feature channels with small value ranges and employs an efficient bit-lowering
method to minimize quantization errors while maintaining inference accuracy.
Furthermore, FlexiQ adjusts its low-bitwidth channel ratio in real time,
enabling quantized models to effectively manage fluctuating inference workload.
  We implemented FlexiQ prototype, including the mixed-precision inference
runtime on our custom NPU and GPUs. Evaluated on eleven convolution- and
transformer-based vision models, FlexiQ achieves on average 6.6% higher
accuracy for 4-bit models with finetuning and outperforms four state-of-the-art
quantization techniques. Moreover, our mixed-precision models achieved an
efficient accuracy-latency trade-off, with the 50% 4-bit model incurring only
0.6% accuracy loss while achieving 40% of the speedup of the 100% 4-bit model
over 8-bit model. Latency evaluations on our NPU and GPUs confirmed that FlexiQ
introduces minimal runtime overhead, demonstrating its hardware efficiency and
overall performance benefits.

*Makram Chahine,Philipp Nazari,Daniela Rus,T. Konstantin Rusch*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出在训练期间对状态空间模型进行平衡截断，通过汉克尔奇异值分析识别并保留高影响力维度，从而在保持表达能力的同时显著加速优化过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 状态空间模型在处理长序列建模任务时需要平衡表达能力和计算负担，核心挑战是在最大化表达性的同时限制计算成本。

Method: 利用控制理论中的汉克尔奇异值分析，在训练过程中识别高能量状态维度并进行平衡截断，适用于线性时不变SSM和选择性模型。

Result: 实验表明，训练期间的维度缩减显著加速了优化过程，压缩后的模型保留了任务关键结构，性能优于直接训练的小维度模型。

Conclusion: 从大模型开始并在训练过程中缩小的SSM能够实现计算效率的同时保持更高的性能表现。

Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs), developed to tackle long sequence modeling tasks
efficiently, offer both parallelizable training and fast inference. At their
core are recurrent dynamical systems that maintain a hidden state, with update
costs scaling with the state dimension. A key design challenge is striking the
right balance between maximizing expressivity and limiting this computational
burden. Control theory, and more specifically Hankel singular value analysis,
provides a potent framework for the measure of energy for each state, as well
as the balanced truncation of the original system down to a smaller
representation with performance guarantees. Leveraging the eigenvalue stability
properties of Hankel matrices, we apply this lens to SSMs during training,
where only dimensions of high influence are identified and preserved. Our
approach applies to Linear Time-Invariant SSMs such as Linear Recurrent Units,
but is also extendable to selective models. Experiments show that in-training
reduction significantly accelerates optimization while preserving expressivity,
with compressed models retaining task-critical structure lost by models trained
directly at smaller dimension. In other words, SSMs that begin large and shrink
during training achieve computational efficiency while maintaining higher
performance.

TL;DR: 本文重新审视视觉自回归模型，将其形式化为迭代精炼框架，包含构建拉普拉斯式潜在金字塔的前向过程和粗到细重建的后向过程，连接了VAR与去噪扩散模型，并分析了三个关键设计选择对效率和保真度的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新理解VAR模型，将其从单纯的下一个尺度自回归视角转变为迭代精炼框架，以更好地解释其效率和保真度，并建立与扩散模型的联系。

Method: 将VAR形式化为确定性前向过程构建潜在金字塔和学习的后向过程进行粗到细重建，通过控制实验量化学习潜在空间、离散分类预测和空间频率分区三个设计因素的影响。

Result: 识别了三个关键设计选择对VAR效率和保真度的贡献，展示了该框架可扩展到图生成和中程天气预报等任务，并提出了实用的接口设计。

Conclusion: 迭代精炼框架为理解VAR提供了新视角，揭示了其高效性的关键因素，并展示了该框架的通用性和实用性，能够与扩散生态系统工具集成。

Abstract: We revisit Visual Autoregressive (VAR) models through the lens of an
iterative-refinement framework. Rather than viewing VAR solely as next-scale
autoregression, we formalise it as a deterministic forward process that
constructs a Laplacian-style latent pyramid, paired with a learned backward
process that reconstructs it in a small number of coarse-to-fine steps. This
view connects VAR to denoising diffusion and isolates three design choices that
help explain its efficiency and fidelity: refining in a learned latent space,
casting prediction as discrete classification over code indices, and
partitioning the task by spatial frequency. We run controlled experiments to
quantify each factor's contribution to fidelity and speed, and we outline how
the same framework extends to permutation-invariant graph generation and to
probabilistic, ensemble-style medium-range weather forecasting. The framework
also suggests practical interfaces for VAR to leverage tools from the diffusion
ecosystem while retaining few-step, scale-parallel generation.

### [141] [Subject-Adaptive Sparse Linear Models for Interpretable Personalized Health Prediction from Multimodal Lifelog Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02835)
*Dohyun Bu,Jisoo Han,Soohwa Kwon,Yulim So,Jong-Seok Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了SASL框架，一种可解释的个性化健康预测方法，结合稀疏线性模型和LightGBM，在保持可解释性的同时达到与黑盒方法相当的预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度神经网络和梯度提升模型在预测健康结果时牺牲了可解释性，且未能充分处理个体间差异。

Method: 使用普通最小二乘回归与个体特定交互项，通过嵌套F检验进行迭代后向特征消除构建稀疏模型，并采用回归-阈值方法优化有序目标的F1分数。

Result: 在CH-2025数据集（10个受试者约450个日观测）上，SASL-LightGBM混合框架与复杂黑盒方法性能相当，但参数更少、透明度更高。

Conclusion: SASL框架为临床实践提供了清晰可操作的见解，在保持可解释性的同时实现了准确的个性化健康预测。

Abstract: Improved prediction of personalized health outcomes -- such as sleep quality
and stress -- from multimodal lifelog data could have meaningful clinical and
practical implications. However, state-of-the-art models, primarily deep neural
networks and gradient-boosted ensembles, sacrifice interpretability and fail to
adequately address the significant inter-individual variability inherent in
lifelog data. To overcome these challenges, we propose the Subject-Adaptive
Sparse Linear (SASL) framework, an interpretable modeling approach explicitly
designed for personalized health prediction. SASL integrates ordinary least
squares regression with subject-specific interactions, systematically
distinguishing global from individual-level effects. We employ an iterative
backward feature elimination method based on nested $F$-tests to construct a
sparse and statistically robust model. Additionally, recognizing that health
outcomes often represent discretized versions of continuous processes, we
develop a regression-then-thresholding approach specifically designed to
maximize macro-averaged F1 scores for ordinal targets. For intrinsically
challenging predictions, SASL selectively incorporates outputs from compact
LightGBM models through confidence-based gating, enhancing accuracy without
compromising interpretability. Evaluations conducted on the CH-2025 dataset --
which comprises roughly 450 daily observations from ten subjects -- demonstrate
that the hybrid SASL-LightGBM framework achieves predictive performance
comparable to that of sophisticated black-box methods, but with significantly
fewer parameters and substantially greater transparency, thus providing clear
and actionable insights for clinicians and practitioners.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Karma是一个知识感知的频率自适应学习模型，用于电池容量估计和剩余使用寿命预测，通过双流深度学习架构结合知识引导，在电池健康预测方面显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据驱动模型虽然能捕捉时间退化特征，但缺乏知识引导，导致长期健康预测不可靠。需要克服电池退化行为的复杂性，如非线性、噪声和容量再生等问题。

Method: 首先进行信号分解得到不同频段的电池信号，然后开发双流深度学习架构：一个流捕捉长期低频退化趋势，另一个流建模高频短期动态。使用粒子滤波器优化知识模型参数，确保物理一致的预测和不确定性量化。

Result: 在两个主流数据集上，Karma在电池健康预测方面分别实现了50.6%和32.6%的平均误差降低，显著优于最先进算法。

Conclusion: Karma模型具有鲁棒性、泛化性和潜力，能够为各种应用提供更安全可靠的电池管理。

Abstract: Battery health prognostics are critical for ensuring safety, efficiency, and
sustainability in modern energy systems. However, it has been challenging to
achieve accurate and robust prognostics due to complex battery degradation
behaviors with nonlinearity, noise, capacity regeneration, etc. Existing
data-driven models capture temporal degradation features but often lack
knowledge guidance, which leads to unreliable long-term health prognostics. To
overcome these limitations, we propose Karma, a knowledge-aware model with
frequency-adaptive learning for battery capacity estimation and remaining
useful life prediction. The model first performs signal decomposition to derive
battery signals in different frequency bands. A dual-stream deep learning
architecture is developed, where one stream captures long-term low-frequency
degradation trends and the other models high-frequency short-term dynamics.
Karma regulates the prognostics with knowledge, where battery degradation is
modeled as a double exponential function based on empirical studies. Our
dual-stream model is used to optimize the parameters of the knowledge with
particle filters to ensure physically consistent and reliable prognostics and
uncertainty quantification. Experimental study demonstrates Karma's superior
performance, achieving average error reductions of 50.6% and 32.6% over
state-of-the-art algorithms for battery health prediction on two mainstream
datasets, respectively. These results highlight Karma's robustness,
generalizability, and potential for safer and more reliable battery management
across diverse applications.

*Aleksei Arzhantsev,Otmane Sakhi,Flavian Vasile*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了RoiRL方法，通过离线迭代强化学习来改进语言模型的推理能力，无需真实奖励标签，比现有的TTRL方法训练速度快2.5倍且性能更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的测试时强化学习(TTRL)需要大量在线RL计算，依赖多数投票奖励，计算成本高昂。需要一种更轻量化的方法来改进语言模型的推理能力。

Method: RoiRL采用离线迭代强化学习方法，优化加权对数似然目标，无需维护参考模型，显著降低了内存和计算需求。

Result: 实验结果显示RoiRL训练速度比TTRL快2.5倍，在推理基准测试中表现一致优于TTRL。

Conclusion: RoiRL为无需标签的自改进语言模型提供了一条可扩展的路径，建立了轻量级离线学习替代方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is central to improving reasoning in large
language models (LLMs) but typically requires ground-truth rewards. Test-Time
Reinforcement Learning (TTRL) removes this need by using majority-vote rewards,
but relies on heavy online RL and incurs substantial computational cost. We
propose RoiRL: Reasoning with offline iterative Reinforcement Learning, a
family of lightweight offline learning alternatives that can target the same
regularized optimal policies. Unlike TTRL, RoiRL eliminates the need to
maintain a reference model and instead optimizes weighted log-likelihood
objectives, enabling stable training with significantly lower memory and
compute requirements. Experimental results show that RoiRL trains to 2.5x
faster and consistently outperforms TTRL on reasoning benchmarks, establishing
a scalable path to self-improving LLMs without labels.

TL;DR: DMark是首个专门为扩散大语言模型设计的数字水印框架，通过三种策略解决传统水印方法在非顺序解码模型上的失效问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散大语言模型生成速度更快但解码顺序任意，破坏了传统基于因果设计的水印方法，需要专门的水印方案。

Method: 提出三种互补策略：预测水印（使用模型预测的令牌）、双向水印（利用扩散解码的前后依赖）、预测-双向水印（结合两者最大化检测强度）。

Result: 在多个dLLM上实验显示，DMark在1%误报率下达到92.0-99.5%的检测率，而现有方法适配版仅为49.6-71.2%，同时保持文本质量。

Conclusion: DMark证明了对非自回归语言模型进行有效水印是可行的，且对文本操作具有鲁棒性。

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) offer faster generation than
autoregressive models while maintaining comparable quality, but existing
watermarking methods fail on them due to their non-sequential decoding. Unlike
autoregressive models that generate tokens left-to-right, dLLMs can finalize
tokens in arbitrary order, breaking the causal design underlying traditional
watermarks. We present DMark, the first watermarking framework designed
specifically for dLLMs. DMark introduces three complementary strategies to
restore watermark detectability: predictive watermarking uses model-predicted
tokens when actual context is unavailable; bidirectional watermarking exploits
both forward and backward dependencies unique to diffusion decoding; and
predictive-bidirectional watermarking combines both approaches to maximize
detection strength. Experiments across multiple dLLMs show that DMark achieves
92.0-99.5% detection rates at 1% false positive rate while maintaining text
quality, compared to only 49.6-71.2% for naive adaptations of existing methods.
DMark also demonstrates robustness against text manipulations, establishing
that effective watermarking is feasible for non-autoregressive language models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最先进的模型依赖计算成本高的最优传输预处理和多阶段训练，且无法发现明确的基因相互作用，因此需要开发更高效且可解释的模型。

Method: 提出Cell-MNN编码器-解码器架构，其潜在表示是局部线性化的ODE，完全端到端训练（除标准PCA预处理外），显式学习生物学一致且可解释的基因相互作用。

Result: Cell-MNN在单细胞基准测试中达到竞争性能，在扩展到更大数据集和跨多个数据集联合训练方面超越现有基线，同时学习到的基因相互作用与TRRUST基因相互作用数据库验证一致。

Conclusion: Cell-MNN提供了一种高效、可扩展且可解释的方法来建模细胞分化动态，具有生物学验证的基因相互作用发现能力。

Abstract: Modeling the dynamics of cellular differentiation is fundamental to advancing
the understanding and treatment of diseases associated with this process, such
as cancer. With the rapid growth of single-cell datasets, this has also become
a particularly promising and active domain for machine learning. Current
state-of-the-art models, however, rely on computationally expensive optimal
transport preprocessing and multi-stage training, while also not discovering
explicit gene interactions. To address these challenges we propose
Cell-Mechanistic Neural Networks (Cell-MNN), an encoder-decoder architecture
whose latent representation is a locally linearized ODE governing the dynamics
of cellular evolution from stem to tissue cells. Cell-MNN is fully end-to-end
(besides a standard PCA pre-processing) and its ODE representation explicitly
learns biologically consistent and interpretable gene interactions.
Empirically, we show that Cell-MNN achieves competitive performance on
single-cell benchmarks, surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in scaling to
larger datasets and joint training across multiple datasets, while also
learning interpretable gene interactions that we validate against the TRRUST
database of gene interactions.

Result: 在MNIST、FEMNIST和CIFAR10数据集上评估，相比FedAvg和Ditto方法，FeDABoost实现了更好的公平性和竞争性性能。

Conclusion: FeDABoost框架有效提升了联邦学习在非IID设置下的公平性和整体性能，通过自适应聚合和动态提升机制解决了客户端性能不均衡问题。

Abstract: This work focuses on improving the performance and fairness of Federated
Learning (FL) in non IID settings by enhancing model aggregation and boosting
the training of underperforming clients. We propose FeDABoost, a novel FL
framework that integrates a dynamic boosting mechanism and an adaptive gradient
aggregation strategy. Inspired by the weighting mechanism of the Multiclass
AdaBoost (SAMME) algorithm, our aggregation method assigns higher weights to
clients with lower local error rates, thereby promoting more reliable
contributions to the global model. In parallel, FeDABoost dynamically boosts
underperforming clients by adjusting the focal loss focusing parameter,
emphasizing hard to classify examples during local training. We have evaluated
FeDABoost on three benchmark datasets MNIST, FEMNIST, and CIFAR10, and compared
its performance with those of FedAvg and Ditto. The results show that FeDABoost
achieves improved fairness and competitive performance.

Conclusion: 该方法在可靠且可解释的临床变长时间序列分类方面具有潜力。

Abstract: Medical time series analysis is challenging due to data sparsity, noise, and
highly variable recording lengths. Prior work has shown that stochastic sparse
sampling effectively handles variable-length signals, while retrieval-augmented
approaches improve explainability and robustness to noise and weak temporal
correlations. In this study, we generalize the stochastic sparse sampling
framework for retrieval-informed classification. Specifically, we weight window
predictions by within-channel similarity and aggregate them in probability
space, yielding convex series-level scores and an explicit evidence trail for
explainability. Our method achieves competitive iEEG classification performance
and provides practitioners with greater transparency and explainability. We
evaluate our method in iEEG recordings collected in four medical centers,
demonstrating its potential for reliable and explainable clinical
variable-length time series classification.

Abstract: Assessing model generalization under distribution shift is essential for
real-world deployment, particularly when labeled test data is unavailable. This
paper presents a unified and practical framework for unsupervised model
evaluation and ranking in two common deployment settings: (1) estimating the
accuracy of a fixed model on multiple unlabeled test sets (dataset-centric
evaluation), and (2) ranking a set of candidate models on a single unlabeled
test set (model-centric evaluation). We demonstrate that two intrinsic
properties of model predictions, namely confidence (which reflects prediction
certainty) and dispersity (which captures the diversity of predicted classes),
together provide strong and complementary signals for generalization. We
systematically benchmark a set of confidence-based, dispersity-based, and
hybrid metrics across a wide range of model architectures, datasets, and
distribution shift types. Our results show that hybrid metrics consistently
outperform single-aspect metrics on both dataset-centric and model-centric
evaluation settings. In particular, the nuclear norm of the prediction matrix
provides robust and accurate performance across tasks, including real-world
datasets, and maintains reliability under moderate class imbalance. These
findings offer a practical and generalizable basis for unsupervised model
assessment in deployment scenarios.

Motivation: 现有的持续强化学习主要关注风险中性决策，而本文旨在探索风险感知决策在持续强化学习中的应用，以优化超越均值的长期性能度量。

Method: 作者首先证明经典风险度量理论与持续设置不兼容，然后基于此洞察扩展了风险度量理论，引入了新的遍历风险度量类别。

Result: 通过案例研究和实证结果，展示了遍历风险度量的直观吸引力和理论合理性。

Conclusion: 遍历风险度量为风险感知的持续强化学习提供了理论基础，能够平衡信息保留和新情境适应之间的关系。

Abstract: Continual reinforcement learning (continual RL) seeks to formalize the
notions of lifelong learning and endless adaptation in RL. In particular, the
aim of continual RL is to develop RL agents that can maintain a careful balance
between retaining useful information and adapting to new situations. To date,
continual RL has been explored almost exclusively through the lens of
risk-neutral decision-making, in which the agent aims to optimize the expected
(or mean) long-run performance. In this work, we present the first formal
theoretical treatment of continual RL through the lens of risk-aware
decision-making, in which the agent aims to optimize a reward-based measure of
long-run performance beyond the mean. In particular, we show that the classical
theory of risk measures, widely used as a theoretical foundation in
non-continual risk-aware RL, is, in its current form, incompatible with the
continual setting. Then, building on this insight, we extend risk measure
theory into the continual setting by introducing a new class of ergodic risk
measures that are compatible with continual learning. Finally, we provide a
case study of risk-aware continual learning, along with empirical results,
which show the intuitive appeal and theoretical soundness of ergodic risk
measures.

fundamental to understanding the dynamics of structural and functional tissue
changes in development, regeneration and repair, disease progression, and
response to treatment. We propose ContextFlow, a novel context-aware flow
matching framework that incorporates prior knowledge to guide the inference of
structural tissue dynamics from spatially resolved omics data. Specifically,
ContextFlow integrates local tissue organization and ligand-receptor
communication patterns into a transition plausibility matrix that regularizes
the optimal transport objective. By embedding these contextual constraints,
ContextFlow generates trajectories that are not only statistically consistent
but also biologically meaningful, making it a generalizable framework for
modeling spatiotemporal dynamics from longitudinal, spatially resolved omics
data. Evaluated on three datasets, ContextFlow consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art flow matching methods across multiple quantitative and
qualitative metrics of inference accuracy and biological coherence. Our code is

TL;DR: 提出一种基于迁移学习的方法，利用高频数据预训练模型，然后通过低频午报数据微调，以预测船舶轴功率，显著降低了预测误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着全球海运增长，能源优化对降低成本和提高运营效率至关重要。轴功率直接影响燃料消耗，但高质量传感器数据获取困难且成本高，而午报数据是可行的替代方案。

Method: 采用迁移学习方法，首先使用高频数据训练模型，然后用低频午报数据对其他船舶进行微调。实验在姊妹船、相似船和不同船上进行验证。

Result: 与仅使用午报数据训练的模型相比，平均绝对百分比误差在姊妹船上降低了10.6%，在相似船上降低了3.6%，在不同船上降低了5.3%。

Conclusion: 迁移学习方法能有效利用高频数据提升低频数据预测精度，为船舶能源优化提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: With the growth of global maritime transportation, energy optimization has
become crucial for reducing costs and ensuring operational efficiency. Shaft
power is the mechanical power transmitted from the engine to the shaft and
directly impacts fuel consumption, making its accurate prediction a paramount
step in optimizing vessel performance. Power consumption is highly correlated
with ship parameters such as speed and shaft rotation per minute, as well as
weather and sea conditions. Frequent access to this operational data can
improve prediction accuracy. However, obtaining high-quality sensor data is
often infeasible and costly, making alternative sources such as noon reports a
viable option. In this paper, we propose a transfer learning-based approach for
predicting vessels shaft power, where a model is initially trained on
high-frequency data from a vessel and then fine-tuned with low-frequency daily
noon reports from other vessels. We tested our approach on sister vessels
(identical dimensions and configurations), a similar vessel (slightly larger
with a different engine), and a different vessel (distinct dimensions and
configurations). The experiments showed that the mean absolute percentage error
decreased by 10.6 percent for sister vessels, 3.6 percent for a similar vessel,
and 5.3 percent for a different vessel, compared to the model trained solely on
noon report data.

Abstract: The development of diagnostic models is gaining traction in the field of
psychiatric disorders. Recently, machine learning classifiers based on
resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) have been
developed to identify brain biomarkers that differentiate psychiatric disorders
from healthy controls. However, conventional machine learning-based diagnostic
models often depend on extensive feature engineering, which introduces bias
through manual intervention. While deep learning models are expected to operate
without manual involvement, their lack of interpretability poses significant
challenges in obtaining explainable and reliable brain biomarkers to support
diagnostic decisions, ultimately limiting their clinical applicability. In this
study, we introduce an end-to-end innovative graph neural network framework
named BrainIB++, which applies the information bottleneck (IB) principle to
identify the most informative data-driven brain regions as subgraphs during
model training for interpretation. We evaluate the performance of our model
against nine established brain network classification methods across three
multi-cohort schizophrenia datasets. It consistently demonstrates superior
diagnostic accuracy and exhibits generalizability to unseen data. Furthermore,
the subgraphs identified by our model also correspond with established clinical
biomarkers in schizophrenia, particularly emphasizing abnormalities in the
visual, sensorimotor, and higher cognition brain functional network. This
alignment enhances the model's interpretability and underscores its relevance
for real-world diagnostic applications.

Motivation: 传统IRL方法只能恢复确定性奖励估计或匹配期望回报，无法捕捉专家行为中更丰富的结构，特别是在学习奖励分布方面。

Method: 通过最小化一阶随机占优违规，将失真风险度量整合到策略学习中，从而恢复奖励分布和分布感知策略。

Result: 在合成基准测试、真实世界神经行为数据和MuJoCo控制任务上的实验表明，该方法恢复了表达性奖励表示并实现了最先进的模仿性能。

Conclusion: 该分布框架适用于行为分析和风险感知模仿学习，能够捕获专家行为的丰富结构。

Abstract: We propose a distributional framework for offline Inverse Reinforcement
Learning (IRL) that jointly models uncertainty over reward functions and full
distributions of returns. Unlike conventional IRL approaches that recover a
deterministic reward estimate or match only expected returns, our method
captures richer structure in expert behavior, particularly in learning the
reward distribution, by minimizing first-order stochastic dominance (FSD)
violations and thus integrating distortion risk measures (DRMs) into policy
learning, enabling the recovery of both reward distributions and
distribution-aware policies. This formulation is well-suited for behavior
analysis and risk-aware imitation learning. Empirical results on synthetic
benchmarks, real-world neurobehavioral data, and MuJoCo control tasks
demonstrate that our method recovers expressive reward representations and
achieves state-of-the-art imitation performance.

TL;DR: DMIS是一个统一的框架，用于在条件不精确的监督下训练鲁棒的扩散模型，通过分解生成和分类组件来处理噪声、模糊或不完整的标签。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 条件扩散模型的训练通常依赖于大规模数据集，这些数据集不可避免地包含条件输入中的不精确信息，如噪声、模糊或不完整的标签，这会导致条件不匹配并降低生成质量。

Method: DMIS框架基于似然最大化，将目标分解为生成和分类组件：生成组件建模不精确标签分布，分类组件利用扩散分类器推断类后验概率，并通过优化的时间步采样策略提高效率。

Result: 在多种形式的不精确监督任务（包括图像生成、弱监督学习和噪声数据集压缩）上的广泛实验表明，DMIS能够持续生成高质量和类判别性的样本。

Conclusion: DMIS是扩散模型中首个系统研究不精确监督的框架，能够有效处理条件输入中的不精确信息，提升生成质量。

Abstract: Conditional diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in various
generative tasks recently, but their training typically relies on large-scale
datasets that inevitably contain imprecise information in conditional inputs.
Such supervision, often stemming from noisy, ambiguous, or incomplete labels,
will cause condition mismatch and degrade generation quality. To address this
challenge, we propose DMIS, a unified framework for training robust Diffusion
Models from Imprecise Supervision, which is the first systematic study within
diffusion models. Our framework is derived from likelihood maximization and
decomposes the objective into generative and classification components: the
generative component models imprecise-label distributions, while the
classification component leverages a diffusion classifier to infer
class-posterior probabilities, with its efficiency further improved by an
optimized timestep sampling strategy. Extensive experiments on diverse forms of
imprecise supervision, covering tasks of image generation, weakly supervised
learning, and noisy dataset condensation demonstrate that DMIS consistently
produces high-quality and class-discriminative samples.

Abstract: The Wasserstein barycenter is defined as the mean of a set of probability
measures under the optimal transport metric, and has numerous applications
spanning machine learning, statistics, and computer graphics. In practice these
input measures are empirical distributions built from sensitive datasets,
motivating a differentially private (DP) treatment. We present, to our

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种参数效率高且可解释的EEG信号分类解决方案，在保持性能的同时大幅减少了模型复杂度

Abstract: Samples of brain signals collected by EEG sensors have inherent
anti-correlations that are well modeled by negative edges in a finite graph. To
differentiate epilepsy patients from healthy subjects using collected EEG
signals, we build lightweight and interpretable transformer-like neural nets by
unrolling a spectral denoising algorithm for signals on a balanced signed graph
-- graph with no cycles of odd number of negative edges. A balanced signed
graph has well-defined frequencies that map to a corresponding positive graph
via similarity transform of the graph Laplacian matrices. We implement an ideal
low-pass filter efficiently on the mapped positive graph via Lanczos
approximation, where the optimal cutoff frequency is learned from data. Given
that two balanced signed graph denoisers learn posterior probabilities of two
different signal classes during training, we evaluate their reconstruction
errors for binary classification of EEG signals. Experiments show that our
method achieves classification performance comparable to representative deep
learning schemes, while employing dramatically fewer parameters.

TL;DR: CHORD框架通过设备-云协作实现个性化混合精度量化，为序列推荐系统提供资源自适应部署方案，无需本地重训练即可实现动态模型适配和加速推理。


<details>

Motivation: 移动设备能力提升使得重排序模型可直接部署在设备上实现实时上下文推荐，但资源异构性需要模型压缩。现有量化方法忽略了设备特定的用户兴趣，导致推荐准确性下降，而设备端微调虽然能捕捉个性化偏好但计算负担重。

Method: CHORD在异构设备上分发随机初始化模型，通过云端的辅助超网络模块识别用户特定的关键参数。参数敏感性分析在多个粒度（层、过滤器、元素级别）进行，实现从用户画像到量化策略的精确映射。通过设备端混合精度量化，无需反向传播即可实现动态模型适配和加速推理。

Conclusion: CHORD框架通过设备-云协作和混合精度量化，成功解决了移动设备上个性化推荐模型的资源自适应部署问题，在保持高准确性的同时显著降低了计算和通信开销。

Abstract: With the advancement of mobile device capabilities, deploying reranking
models directly on devices has become feasible, enabling real-time contextual
recommendations. When migrating models from cloud to devices, resource
heterogeneity inevitably necessitates model compression. Recent quantization
methods show promise for efficient deployment, yet they overlook
device-specific user interests, resulting in compromised recommendation
accuracy. While on-device finetuning captures personalized user preference, it
imposes additional computational burden through local retraining. To address
these challenges, we propose a framework for \underline{\textbf{C}}ustomizing
\underline{\textbf{H}}ybrid-precision \underline{\textbf{O}}n-device model for
sequential \underline{\textbf{R}}ecommendation with
\underline{\textbf{D}}evice-cloud collaboration (\textbf{CHORD}), leveraging
channel-wise mixed-precision quantization to simultaneously achieve
personalization and resource-adaptive deployment. CHORD distributes randomly
initialized models across heterogeneous devices and identifies user-specific
critical parameters through auxiliary hypernetwork modules on the cloud. Our
parameter sensitivity analysis operates across multiple granularities (layer,
filter, and element levels), enabling precise mapping from user profiles to
quantization strategy. Through on-device mixed-precision quantization, CHORD
delivers dynamic model adaptation and accelerated inference without
backpropagation, eliminating costly retraining cycles. We minimize
communication overhead by encoding quantization strategies using only 2 bits
per channel instead of 32-bit weights. Experiments on three real-world datasets
with two popular backbones (SASRec and Caser) demonstrate the accuracy,
efficiency, and adaptivity of CHORD.

Result: 贝叶斯机器学习势能在保持与最先进模型竞争性精度的同时，实现了不确定性引导的主动学习、分布外检测和能量/力校准。使用贝叶斯主动学习分歧方法显著优于随机采样和基于能量不确定性的采样。

Conclusion: 贝叶斯等变神经网络为开发具有不确定性感知能力的大规模原子模拟机器学习势能提供了强大框架，解决了当前机器学习势能在不确定性量化方面的关键限制。

Abstract: Machine learning potentials (MLPs) have become essential for large-scale
atomistic simulations, enabling ab initio-level accuracy with computational
efficiency. However, current MLPs struggle with uncertainty quantification,
limiting their reliability for active learning, calibration, and
out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. We address these challenges by developing
Bayesian E(3) equivariant MLPs with iterative restratification of many-body
message passing. Our approach introduces the joint energy-force negative
log-likelihood (NLL$_\text{JEF}$) loss function, which explicitly models
uncertainty in both energies and interatomic forces, yielding superior accuracy
compared to conventional NLL losses. We systematically benchmark multiple
Bayesian approaches, including deep ensembles with mean-variance estimation,
stochastic weight averaging Gaussian, improved variational online Newton, and
laplace approximation by evaluating their performance on uncertainty
prediction, OOD detection, calibration, and active learning tasks. We further
demonstrate that NLL$_\text{JEF}$ facilitates efficient active learning by
quantifying energy and force uncertainties. Using Bayesian active learning by
disagreement (BALD), our framework outperforms random sampling and
energy-uncertainty-based sampling. Our results demonstrate that Bayesian MLPs
achieve competitive accuracy with state-of-the-art models while enabling
uncertainty-guided active learning, OOD detection, and energy/forces
calibration. This work establishes Bayesian equivariant neural networks as a
powerful framework for developing uncertainty-aware MLPs for atomistic
simulations at scale.

Abstract: Global optimization of expensive, derivative-free black-box functions
requires extreme sample efficiency. While Bayesian optimization (BO) is the
current state-of-the-art, its performance hinges on surrogate and acquisition
function hyper-parameters that are often hand-tuned and fail to generalize
across problem landscapes. We present ZeroShotOpt, a general-purpose,

20D. Our approach leverages offline reinforcement learning on large-scale
optimization trajectories collected from 12 BO variants. To scale pretraining,
we generate millions of synthetic Gaussian process-based functions with diverse
landscapes, enabling the model to learn transferable optimization policies. As
a result, ZeroShotOpt achieves robust zero-shot generalization on a wide array
of unseen benchmarks, matching or surpassing the sample efficiency of leading
global optimizers, including BO, while also offering a reusable foundation for
future extensions and improvements. Our open-source code, dataset, and model

Conclusion: UD3RL框架为接近旅行商问题提供了有效的解决方案，具有优异的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: In recent years, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has gained traction for
solving the NP-hard traveling salesman problem (TSP). However, limited
attention has been given to the close-enough TSP (CETSP), primarily due to the
challenge introduced by its neighborhood-based visitation criterion, wherein a
node is considered visited if the agent enters a compact neighborhood around
it. In this work, we formulate a Markov decision process (MDP) for CETSP using
a discretization scheme and propose a novel unified dual-decoder DRL (UD3RL)
framework that separates decision-making into node selection and waypoint
determination. Specifically, an adapted encoder is employed for effective
feature extraction, followed by a node-decoder and a loc-decoder to handle the
two sub-tasks, respectively. A k-nearest neighbors subgraph interaction
strategy is further introduced to enhance spatial reasoning during location
decoding. Furthermore, we customize the REINFORCE algorithm to train UD3RL as a
unified model capable of generalizing across different problem sizes and
varying neighborhood radius types (i.e., constant and random radii).
Experimental results show that UD3RL outperforms conventional methods in both
solution quality and runtime, while exhibiting strong generalization across
problem scales, spatial distributions, and radius ranges, as well as robustness
to dynamic environments.

Conclusion: 链式GNN方法通过迭代精化和自举效应，成功提升了图神经网络在图对齐问题上的性能，填补了GNN在组合优化问题上的表现差距。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have struggled to outperform traditional
optimization methods on combinatorial problems, limiting their practical
impact. We address this gap by introducing a novel chaining procedure for the
graph alignment problem, a fundamental NP-hard task of finding optimal node
correspondences between unlabeled graphs using only structural information. Our
method trains a sequence of GNNs where each network learns to iteratively
refine similarity matrices produced by previous networks. During inference,
this creates a bootstrap effect: each GNN improves upon partial solutions by
incorporating discrete ranking information about node alignment quality from
prior iterations. We combine this with a powerful architecture that operates on
node pairs rather than individual nodes, capturing global structural patterns
essential for alignment that standard message-passing networks cannot
represent. Extensive experiments on synthetic benchmarks demonstrate
substantial improvements: our chained GNNs achieve over 3x better accuracy than
existing methods on challenging instances, and uniquely solve regular graphs
where all competing approaches fail. When combined with traditional
optimization as post-processing, our method substantially outperforms
state-of-the-art solvers on the graph alignment benchmark.

Abstract: Diffusion- and flow-based generative models have recently demonstrated strong
performance in protein backbone generation tasks, offering unprecedented
capabilities for de novo protein design. However, while achieving notable
performance in generation quality, these models are limited by their generating
speed, often requiring hundreds of iterative steps in the reverse-diffusion
process. This computational bottleneck limits their practical utility in
large-scale protein discovery, where thousands to millions of candidate
structures are needed. To address this challenge, we explore the techniques of
score distillation, which has shown great success in reducing the number of
sampling steps in the vision domain while maintaining high generation quality.
However, a straightforward adaptation of these methods results in unacceptably
low designability. Through extensive study, we have identified how to
appropriately adapt Score identity Distillation (SiD), a state-of-the-art score
distillation strategy, to train few-step protein backbone generators which
significantly reduce sampling time, while maintaining comparable performance to
their pretrained teacher model. In particular, multistep generation combined
with inference time noise modulation is key to the success. We demonstrate that
our distilled few-step generators achieve more than a 20-fold improvement in
sampling speed, while achieving similar levels of designability, diversity, and
novelty as the Proteina teacher model. This reduction in inference cost enables
large-scale in silico protein design, thereby bringing diffusion-based models
closer to real-world protein engineering applications.

Method: 基于干预的方法，在训练过程中通过置换特征值后验证性能的变化来确定相关特征。该方法与模型和任务无关，能够跟踪特征重要性的演化过程。

Result: 经验结果验证了该方法对不同图架构的灵活性，以及在更具挑战性的图学习设置中的适应性。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅能在训练结束时返回特征重要性分数，还能跟踪特征被逐步移除时相关性的演化过程，从而有效监控特征消除效果并评估其他指标。

Abstract: We propose an adaptive node feature selection approach for graph neural
networks (GNNs) that identifies and removes unnecessary features during
training. The ability to measure how features contribute to model output is key
for interpreting decisions, reducing dimensionality, and even improving
performance by eliminating unhelpful variables. However, graph-structured data
introduces complex dependencies that may not be amenable to classical feature
importance metrics. Inspired by this challenge, we present a model- and
task-agnostic method that determines relevant features during training based on
changes in validation performance upon permuting feature values. We
theoretically motivate our intervention-based approach by characterizing how
GNN performance depends on the relationships between node data and graph
structure. Not only do we return feature importance scores once training
concludes, we also track how relevance evolves as features are successively
dropped. We can therefore monitor if features are eliminated effectively and
also evaluate other metrics with this technique. Our empirical results verify
the flexibility of our approach to different graph architectures as well as its
adaptability to more challenging graph learning settings.

TL;DR: AdaBet是一种无需梯度的层选择方法，通过分析激活空间的拓扑特征（Betti数）来识别重要层，用于在边缘设备上进行高效重训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在边缘和移动设备上使用预训练神经网络时，需要在有限计算和内存资源下适应用户特定的运行时数据分布。当前方法依赖标签数据、完整反向传播或服务器端元训练，不适合受限设备。

Method: 使用Betti数分析激活空间的拓扑特征，仅通过前向传播来对重要层进行排序和选择，无需标签或梯度。

Result: 在16对基准模型和数据集上的评估显示，AdaBet比基于梯度的方法平均分类准确率提高5%，同时平均峰值内存消耗减少40%。

Conclusion: AdaBet提供了一种高效的无梯度层选择方法，能够在资源受限的边缘设备上实现更好的模型适应性能。

Abstract: To utilize pre-trained neural networks on edge and mobile devices, we often
require efficient adaptation to user-specific runtime data distributions while
operating under limited compute and memory resources. On-device retraining with
a target dataset can facilitate such adaptations; however, it remains
impractical due to the increasing depth of modern neural nets, as well as the
computational overhead associated with gradient-based optimization across all
layers. Current approaches reduce training cost by selecting a subset of layers
for retraining, however, they rely on labeled data, at least one full-model
backpropagation, or server-side meta-training; limiting their suitability for
constrained devices. We introduce AdaBet, a gradient-free layer selection
approach to rank important layers by analyzing topological features of their
activation spaces through Betti Numbers and using forward passes alone. AdaBet
allows selecting layers with high learning capacity, which are important for
retraining and adaptation, without requiring labels or gradients. Evaluating
AdaBet on sixteen pairs of benchmark models and datasets, shows AdaBet achieves
an average gain of 5% more classification accuracy over gradient-based
baselines while reducing average peak memory consumption by 40%.

Abstract: Efficient real-time dispatching in urban metro systems is essential for
ensuring service reliability, maximizing resource utilization, and improving
passenger satisfaction. This study presents a novel deep learning framework
centered on a Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) model designed to
predict the complex spatiotemporal propagation of train headways across an
entire metro line. By directly incorporating planned terminal headways as a
critical input alongside historical headway data, the proposed model accurately
forecasts future headway dynamics, effectively capturing both their temporal
evolution and spatial dependencies across all stations. This capability
empowers dispatchers to evaluate the impact of various terminal headway control
decisions without resorting to computationally intensive simulations. We
introduce a flexible methodology to simulate diverse dispatcher strategies,
ranging from maintaining even headways to implementing custom patterns derived
from observed terminal departures. In contrast to existing research primarily
focused on passenger load predictioning or atypical disruption scenarios, our
approach emphasizes proactive operational control. Evaluated on a large-scale
dataset from an urban metro line, the proposed ConvLSTM model demonstrates
promising headway predictions, offering actionable insights for real-time
decision-making. This framework provides rail operators with a powerful,
computationally efficient tool to optimize dispatching strategies, thereby
significantly improving service consistency and passenger satisfaction.

Conclusion: 投资组合感知的目标和几何感知的归纳偏置对于机器学习系统中的风险感知资本分配至关重要。

Abstract: Robust asset allocation is a key challenge in quantitative finance, where
deep-learning forecasters often fail due to objective mismatch and error
amplification. We introduce the Signature-Informed Transformer (SIT), a novel
framework that learns end-to-end allocation policies by directly optimizing a
risk-aware financial objective. SIT's core innovations include path signatures
for a rich geometric representation of asset dynamics and a signature-augmented
attention mechanism embedding financial inductive biases, like lead-lag
effects, into the model. Evaluated on daily S\&P 100 equity data, SIT
decisively outperforms traditional and deep-learning baselines, especially when
compared to predict-then-optimize models. These results indicate that
portfolio-aware objectives and geometry-aware inductive biases are essential
for risk-aware capital allocation in machine-learning systems. The code is

Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence has become a crucial area of research,
aiming to demystify the decision-making processes of deep learning models.
Among various explainability techniques, counterfactual explanations have been
proven particularly promising, as they offer insights into model behavior by
highlighting minimal changes that would alter a prediction. Despite their
potential, these explanations are often complex and technical, making them
difficult for non-experts to interpret. To address this challenge, we propose a
novel pipeline that leverages Language Models, large and small, to compose
narratives for counterfactual explanations. We employ knowledge distillation
techniques along with a refining mechanism to enable Small Language Models to
perform comparably to their larger counterparts while maintaining robust
reasoning abilities. In addition, we introduce a simple but effective
evaluation method to assess natural language narratives, designed to verify
whether the models' responses are in line with the factual, counterfactual
ground truth. As a result, our proposed pipeline enhances both the reasoning
capabilities and practical performance of student models, making them more
suitable for real-world use cases.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准解码方法在学习验证器存在错误时容易导致灾难性失败，需要更鲁棒的解码策略来应对验证器错误。

Method: VGB算法将自回归生成视为部分生成树上的随机游走，使用过程验证器和基础模型指导转移概率，并引入概率回溯机制。

Conclusion: VGB通过理论基础的随机游走和回溯机制，有效提升了对验证器错误的鲁棒性，为过程引导的测试时采样提供了新思路。

Abstract: Test-time algorithms that combine the generative power of language models
with process verifiers that assess the quality of partial generations offer a
promising lever for eliciting new reasoning capabilities, but the algorithmic
design space and computational scaling properties of such approaches are still
opaque, and their benefits are far from apparent when one accounts for the cost
of learning a high-quality verifier. Our starting point is the observation that
seemingly benign errors in a learned verifier can lead to catastrophic failures
for standard decoding techniques due to error amplification during the course
of generation. We then ask: can this be improved with more sophisticated
decoding strategies?
  We introduce a new process-guided test-time sampling algorithm, VGB, which
uses theoretically grounded backtracking to achieve provably better robustness
to verifier errors. VGB interprets autoregressive generation as a random walk
on a tree of partial generations, with transition probabilities guided by the
process verifier and base model; crucially, backtracking occurs
probabilistically. This process generalizes the seminal Sinclair-Jerrum random
walk (Sinclair & Jerrum, 1989) from the literature on approximate counting and
sampling in theoretical computer science, and a conceptual contribution of our
work is to highlight parallels with this literature. Empirically, we
demonstrate on both synthetic and real language modeling tasks that VGB
outperforms baselines on a variety of metrics.

Motivation: 通过高码率量化理论的假设，研究MoE模型在输入空间分割足够精细时的理论性能，特别是近似误差和估计误差的平衡问题。

Method: 基于高码率量化理论假设，定义MoE模型为输入空间分割为小区域，每个区域使用单参数专家作为常数预测器，分析一维和多维输入的测试误差及其最小化。

Result: 理论分析了一维输入的测试误差最小化分割和专家配置，多维输入的测试误差上界及其最小化，并研究了专家参数学习的统计特性。

Conclusion: 理论上和实证上展示了MoE学习中近似误差与估计误差之间的权衡如何依赖于专家数量，为MoE模型设计提供了理论指导。

Abstract: This paper uses classical high-rate quantization theory to provide new
insights into mixture-of-experts (MoE) models for regression tasks. Our MoE is
defined by a segmentation of the input space to regions, each with a
single-parameter expert that acts as a constant predictor with zero-compute at
inference. Motivated by high-rate quantization theory assumptions, we assume
that the number of experts is sufficiently large to make their input-space
regions very small. This lets us to study the approximation error of our MoE
model class: (i) for one-dimensional inputs, we formulate the test error and
its minimizing segmentation and experts; (ii) for multidimensional inputs, we
formulate an upper bound for the test error and study its minimization.
Moreover, we consider the learning of the expert parameters from a training
dataset, given an input-space segmentation, and formulate their statistical
learning properties. This leads us to theoretically and empirically show how
the tradeoff between approximation and estimation errors in MoE learning
depends on the number of experts.

Conclusion: 通过关注校准误差的主动学习方法能有效解决DNN不确定性未校准问题，提升模型性能。

Abstract: We study the problem of actively learning a classifier with a low calibration
error. One of the most popular Acquisition Functions (AFs) in pool-based Active
Learning (AL) is querying by the model's uncertainty. However, we recognize
that an uncalibrated uncertainty model on the unlabeled pool may significantly
affect the AF effectiveness, leading to sub-optimal generalization and high
calibration error on unseen data. Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) make it even
worse as the model uncertainty from DNN is usually uncalibrated. Therefore, we
propose a new AF by estimating calibration errors and query samples with the
highest calibration error before leveraging DNN uncertainty. Specifically, we
utilize a kernel calibration error estimator under the covariate shift and
formally show that AL with this AF eventually leads to a bounded calibration
error on the unlabeled pool and unseen test data. Empirically, our proposed
method surpasses other AF baselines by having a lower calibration and
generalization error across pool-based AL settings.

Motivation: 学习率预热已成为深度学习的普遍启发式方法，但其理论基础仍不清楚。本文旨在从原理上解释为什么预热能改善训练效果。

Method: 基于广义(L0,L1)-平滑性条件，该条件将局部曲率限制为损失次优性的线性函数。在此假设下，分析带预热调度的梯度下降收敛性，并与固定步长方法进行理论比较。

Result: 理论和实验证明，在广义平滑性条件下，带预热调度的梯度下降比固定步长收敛更快，建立了上下复杂度界限。实验验证了预热在语言和视觉模型中的实际效益。

Conclusion: 学习率预热通过利用损失函数的局部曲率特性，在训练初期逐步增加学习率，能够实现更快的收敛速度，这为预热启发式方法提供了坚实的理论基础。

Abstract: Learning rate warm-up - increasing the learning rate at the beginning of
training - has become a ubiquitous heuristic in modern deep learning, yet its
theoretical foundations remain poorly understood. In this work, we provide a
principled explanation for why warm-up improves training. We rely on a
generalization of the $(L_0, L_1)$-smoothness condition, which bounds local
curvature as a linear function of the loss sub-optimality and exhibits
desirable closure properties. We demonstrate both theoretically and empirically
that this condition holds for common neural architectures trained with
mean-squared error and cross-entropy losses. Under this assumption, we prove
that Gradient Descent with a warm-up schedule achieves faster convergence than
with a fixed step-size, establishing upper and lower complexity bounds.
Finally, we validate our theoretical insights through experiments on language
and vision models, confirming the practical benefits of warm-up schedules.

Motivation: 解决联邦学习在资源受限边缘节点部署的挑战，包括有限内存、能源和通信带宽，以及传统同步和异步方法在异构大规模网络中因掉队者导致的延迟和收敛缓慢问题。

Method: 采用半异步联邦学习框架，使用稀疏参数更新和基于客户端更新年龄与方差的陈旧度加权聚合机制。

Result: 在包含500个客户端和90%掉队者的多种模型和数据分布实验中，FTTE比同步联邦学习（如FedAVG）实现81%更快的收敛速度、80%更低的设备内存使用和69%的通信负载减少，同时在半异步方法（如FedBuff）中达到相当或更高的目标精度。

Conclusion: FTTE是首个在异构且主要为资源受限边缘设备的真实世界联邦学习部署中实用且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
distributed devices while preserving data privacy, but deployment on
resource-constrained edge nodes remains challenging due to limited memory,
energy, and communication bandwidth. Traditional synchronous and asynchronous
FL approaches further suffer from straggler induced delays and slow convergence
in heterogeneous, large scale networks. We present FTTE (Federated Tiny
Training Engine),a novel semi-asynchronous FL framework that uniquely employs
sparse parameter updates and a staleness-weighted aggregation based on both age
and variance of client updates. Extensive experiments across diverse models and
data distributions - including up to 500 clients and 90% stragglers -
demonstrate that FTTE not only achieves 81% faster convergence, 80% lower
on-device memory usage, and 69% communication payload reduction than
synchronous FL (eg.FedAVG), but also consistently reaches comparable or higher
target accuracy than semi-asynchronous (eg.FedBuff) in challenging regimes.
These results establish FTTE as the first practical and scalable solution for
real-world FL deployments on heterogeneous and predominantly
resource-constrained edge devices.

Motivation: 传统Q-learning UCB算法在分布偏移后可能利用次优奖励，需要开发能够检测并适应分布变化的算法。

Method: 提出Density-QUCB算法，使用转移密度函数检测分布偏移，并利用其似然改进Q-learning UCB的不确定性估计，平衡探索与利用。

Result: 理论证明DQUCB比QUCB有更好的遗憾保证，实验显示在RL任务和COVID-19患者分配任务中DQUCB具有更低遗憾和更高计算效率。

Conclusion: DQUCB能有效处理非平稳RL中的分布偏移问题，在理论和实践中都表现出优越性能。

Abstract: We study the Non-Stationary Reinforcement Learning (RL) under distribution
shifts in both finite-horizon episodic and infinite-horizon discounted Markov
Decision Processes (MDPs). In the finite-horizon case, the transition functions
may suddenly change at a particular episode. In the infinite-horizon setting,
such changes can occur at an arbitrary time step during the agent's interaction
with the environment. While the Q-learning Upper Confidence Bound algorithm
(QUCB) can discover a proper policy during learning, due to the distribution
shifts, this policy can exploit sub-optimal rewards after the shift happens. To
address this issue, we propose Density-QUCB (DQUCB), a shift-aware
Q-learning~UCB algorithm, which uses a transition density function to detect
distribution shifts, then leverages its likelihood to enhance the uncertainty
estimation quality of Q-learning~UCB, resulting in a balance between
exploration and exploitation. Theoretically, we prove that our oracle DQUCB
achieves a better regret guarantee than QUCB. Empirically, our DQUCB enjoys the
computational efficiency of model-free RL and outperforms QUCB baselines by
having a lower regret across RL tasks, as well as a real-world COVID-19 patient
hospital allocation task using a Deep-Q-learning architecture.

Abstract: Benchmarks for competition-style reasoning have advanced evaluation in
mathematics and programming, yet physics remains comparatively explored. Most
existing physics benchmarks evaluate only final answers, which fail to capture
reasoning processes, while recent stepwise methods rely on heuristic
LLM-as-judge scoring or restrictive linear assumptions, limiting reliability
and diagnostic validity. We introduce PRISM-Physics, a process-level evaluation
framework and benchmark for complex physics reasoning problems. Solutions are
represented as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) of formulas, explicitly encoding
causal dependencies among intermediate steps to enable fine-grained,
interpretable, and theoretically grounded scoring. We prove the optimality of
the DAG representation and the corresponding scoring policy. Combining with a
fully rule-based method for symbolic formula equivalence matching that we
developed, we ensure consistent validation across diverse formulations without
heuristic judgments. Results show that our evaluation framework is more aligned
with human experts' scoring. Experiments on state-of-the-art LLMs reveal
persistent reasoning failures in physics, while step-level scoring offers both
diagnostic insight and rich signals for later training. By combining structural
rigor, theoretical guarantees, and symbolic validation, PRISM-Physics provides
a principled foundation for advancing process-level evaluation and guiding the
development of models with deeper scientific reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: 叠加解耦对于映射度量揭示神经代码间真实表征对齐是必要的。

Abstract: The superposition hypothesis states that a single neuron within a population
may participate in the representation of multiple features in order for the
population to represent more features than the number of neurons. In
neuroscience and AI, representational alignment metrics measure the extent to
which different deep neural networks (DNNs) or brains represent similar
information. In this work, we explore a critical question: \textit{does
superposition interact with alignment metrics in any undesirable way?} We
hypothesize that models which represent the same features in \textit{different
superposition arrangements}, i.e., their neurons have different linear
combinations of the features, will interfere with predictive mapping metrics
(semi-matching, soft-matching, linear regression), producing lower alignment
than expected. We first develop a theory for how the strict permutation metrics
are dependent on superposition arrangements. This is tested by training sparse
autoencoders (SAEs) to disentangle superposition in toy models, where alignment
scores are shown to typically increase when a model's base neurons are replaced
with its sparse overcomplete latent codes. We find similar increases for
DNN\(\rightarrow\)DNN and DNN\(\rightarrow\)brain linear regression alignment
in the visual domain. Our results suggest that superposition disentanglement is
necessary for mapping metrics to uncover the true representational alignment
between neural codes.

Result: 随机森林分类器表现最佳，精确准确率为41.4%，±1 RPE准确率为85.9%；离心重复时间是最强预测因子。

Conclusion: 证明了基于可穿戴传感器的RPE估计可行性，并确定了提高模型泛化能力的关键挑战。

Abstract: Accurate estimation of rating of perceived exertion (RPE) can enhance
resistance training through personalized feedback and injury prevention. This
study investigates the application of machine learning models to estimate RPE
during single-arm dumbbell bicep curls, using data from wearable inertial and
electromyography (EMG) sensors. A custom dataset of 69 sets and over 1000
repetitions was collected, with statistical features extracted for model
training. Among the models evaluated, a random forest classifier achieved the
highest performance, with 41.4% exact accuracy and 85.9% $\pm1$ RPE accuracy.
While the inclusion of EMG data slightly improved model accuracy over inertial
sensors alone, its utility may have been limited by factors such as data
quality and placement sensitivity. Feature analysis highlighted eccentric
repetition time as the strongest RPE predictor. The results demonstrate the
feasibility of wearable-sensor-based RPE estimation and identify key challenges
for improving model generalizability.

Motivation: 传统单次选择策略如多数投票和Best-of-N在困难任务中表现不佳，Pass@k评估允许提交多个响应，需要更有效的推理策略。

Method: 提出Best-of-Majority策略，首先限制候选集为高频响应，然后选择前k个奖励最高的响应。

Conclusion: BoM在数学问题推理实验中优于多数投票和Best-of-N，且性能不会随N增加而下降。

Abstract: LLM inference often generates a batch of candidates for a prompt and selects
one via strategies like majority voting or Best-of- N (BoN). For difficult
tasks, this single-shot selection often underperforms. Consequently,
evaluations commonly report Pass@$k$: the agent may submit up to $k$ responses,
and only the best of them is used when computing regret. Motivated by this, we
study inference scaling in the more general Pass@$k$ inference setting, and
prove that neither majority voting nor BoN exhibits the desirable scaling with
$k$ and the sampling budget $N$. Combining the advantages of majority voting
and BoN, we propose a new inference strategy called Best-of-Majority (BoM),
with a pivotal step that restricts the candidates to the responses with high
frequency in the $N$ samples before selecting the top-$k$ rewards. We prove
that when the sampling budget is $N=\tilde\Omega(C^*)$, the regret of BoM is
$O(\epsilon_{\mathrm{opt}}+\sqrt{\epsilon_{\mathrm{RM}}^2C^*/k})$, where $C^*$
is the coverage coefficient, $\epsilon_{\mathrm{RM}}$ is the estimation error
of the reward model, and $\epsilon_{\mathrm{opt}}$ is the estimation error of
reward at the optimal response. We further establish a matching lower bound,
certifying that our algorithm is minimax optimal. Beyond optimality, BoM has a
key advantage: unlike majority voting and BoN, its performance does not degrade
when increasing $N$. Experimental results of inference on math problems show
BoM outperforming both majority voting and BoN.

Motivation: 部分可观测性是强化学习中的主要挑战，需要学习复杂的历史依赖策略。特权专家蒸馏利用训练期间的潜在状态信息来学习最优潜在马尔可夫策略，但存在已知的失败模式。

Method: 通过理论模型（扰动块MDP）和模拟运动任务的受控实验，对比特权专家蒸馏与无特权信息的标准RL方法。

Result: 实验结果表明：(1) 权衡取决于潜在动态的随机性，与理论预测一致；(2) 最优潜在策略并非总是最佳蒸馏目标。

Conclusion: 研究结果为有效利用特权信息提供了新指导原则，有望提升许多实际部分可观测领域中策略学习的效率。

Abstract: Partial observability is a notorious challenge in reinforcement learning
(RL), due to the need to learn complex, history-dependent policies. Recent
empirical successes have used privileged expert distillation--which leverages
availability of latent state information during training (e.g., from a
simulator) to learn and imitate the optimal latent, Markovian policy--to
disentangle the task of "learning to see" from "learning to act". While expert
distillation is more computationally efficient than RL without latent state
information, it also has well-documented failure modes. In this paper--through
a simple but instructive theoretical model called the perturbed Block MDP, and
controlled experiments on challenging simulated locomotion tasks--we
investigate the algorithmic trade-off between privileged expert distillation
and standard RL without privileged information. Our main findings are: (1) The
trade-off empirically hinges on the stochasticity of the latent dynamics, as
theoretically predicted by contrasting approximate decodability with belief
contraction in the perturbed Block MDP; and (2) The optimal latent policy is
not always the best latent policy to distill. Our results suggest new
guidelines for effectively exploiting privileged information, potentially
advancing the efficiency of policy learning across many practical partially
observable domains.

TL;DR: 本文提出了低概率正则化(Lp-Reg)方法来解决RLVR训练中的探索瓶颈问题，通过保护有价值的低概率探索性token来维持模型探索能力，在数学推理任务上取得了60.17%的平均准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR在复杂推理中推动了大语言模型的发展，但训练过程中存在性能瓶颈：随着策略熵的崩溃，模型探索能力下降，导致性能停滞。现有方法通常通过维持高策略熵来解决，但缺乏对有意义探索机制的理解。

Method: 提出了低概率正则化(Lp-Reg)方法，其核心机制是通过构建启发式代理分布来正则化策略。该代理分布通过过滤掉噪声token并对剩余候选token重新归一化得到，从而放大推理火花(reasoning sparks)的概率，并通过KL散度保护这些有价值的token不被消除。

Result: Lp-Reg能够实现约1000步的稳定在线训练，而基线熵控制方法在此阶段会崩溃。在五个数学基准测试上达到了60.17%的平均准确率，比先前方法提高了2.66%。

Conclusion: Lp-Reg通过保护低概率但关键的探索性token，有效解决了RLVR训练中的探索退化问题，实现了更稳定的训练和更好的性能表现。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has propelled Large
Language Models in complex reasoning, yet its scalability is often hindered by
a training bottleneck where performance plateaus as policy entropy collapses,
signaling a loss of exploration. Previous methods typically address this by
maintaining high policy entropy, yet the precise mechanisms that govern
meaningful exploration have remained underexplored. Our analysis suggests that
an unselective focus on entropy risks amplifying irrelevant tokens and
destabilizing training. This paper investigates the exploration dynamics within
RLVR and identifies a key issue: the gradual elimination of valuable
low-probability exploratory tokens, which we term \textbf{\textit{reasoning
sparks}}. We find that while abundant in pre-trained models, these sparks are
systematically extinguished during RLVR due to over-penalization, leading to a
degeneracy in exploration. To address this, we introduce Low-probability
Regularization (Lp-Reg). Its core mechanism regularizes the policy towards a
heuristic proxy distribution. This proxy is constructed by filtering out
presumed noise tokens and re-normalizing the distribution over the remaining
candidates. The result is a less-noisy proxy where the probability of
\textit{reasoning sparks} is amplified, which then serves as a soft
regularization target to shield these valuable tokens from elimination via KL
divergence. Experiments show that Lp-Reg enables stable on-policy training for
around 1,000 steps, a regime where baseline entropy-control methods collapse.
This sustained exploration leads to state-of-the-art performance, achieving a
$60.17\%$ average accuracy on five math benchmarks, an improvement of $2.66\%$
over prior methods. Code is available at https://github.com/CarlanLark/Lp-Reg.
