### [1] [MultiFoodhat: A potential new paradigm for intelligent food quality inspection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13889)
*Yue Hu,Guohang Zhuang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MultiFoodChat是一个基于多智能体推理的零样本食物识别框架，通过视觉-语言模型和大语言模型的协作对话实现无需额外训练的食物分类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有监督模型依赖大量标注数据且泛化能力有限，需要开发无需标注数据就能识别新食物类别的零样本方法。

Method: 集成视觉语言模型和大型语言模型，通过多轮视觉-文本对话进行协作推理，使用对象感知令牌捕获细粒度视觉属性，交互式推理代理动态解释上下文线索。

Result: 在多个公共食物数据集上的实验表明，MultiFoodChat在识别准确性和可解释性方面优于现有的无监督和少样本方法。

Conclusion: 该框架展示了作为智能食品质量检测和分析新范式的潜力，能够灵活理解复杂食物场景而无需额外训练或人工标注。

Abstract: Food image classification plays a vital role in intelligent food quality
inspection, dietary assessment, and automated monitoring. However, most
existing supervised models rely heavily on large labeled datasets and exhibit
limited generalization to unseen food categories. To overcome these challenges,
this study introduces MultiFoodChat, a dialogue-driven multi-agent reasoning
framework for zero-shot food recognition. The framework integrates
vision-language models (VLMs) and large language models (LLMs) to enable
collaborative reasoning through multi-round visual-textual dialogues. An Object
Perception Token (OPT) captures fine-grained visual attributes, while an
Interactive Reasoning Agent (IRA) dynamically interprets contextual cues to
refine predictions. This multi-agent design allows flexible and human-like
understanding of complex food scenes without additional training or manual
annotations. Experiments on multiple public food datasets demonstrate that
MultiFoodChat achieves superior recognition accuracy and interpretability
compared with existing unsupervised and few-shot methods, highlighting its
potential as a new paradigm for intelligent food quality inspection and
analysis.

### [2] [Post-surgical Endometriosis Segmentation in Laparoscopic Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13899)
*Andreas Leibetseder,Klaus Schoeffmann,Jörg Keckstein,Simon Keckstein*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 开发了一个用于分割子宫内膜异位症深色植入物的系统，能够分析腹腔镜手术视频并标注识别区域


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 子宫内膜异位症具有多种视觉表现且位置多变，使得其识别对非专科医生来说非常困难且容易出错，需要为妇科医生提供辅助工具

Method: 训练系统识别子宫内膜异位症的常见视觉表现——深色子宫内膜植入物，分析腹腔镜手术视频，用多色覆盖层标注识别区域，并显示检测摘要

Result: 系统能够成功识别和分割深色子宫内膜植入物区域，为视频浏览提供改进的检测摘要

Conclusion: 该系统能够有效辅助妇科医生识别子宫内膜异位症，提高诊断准确性和手术视频浏览效率

Abstract: Endometriosis is a common women's condition exhibiting a manifold visual
appearance in various body-internal locations. Having such properties makes its
identification very difficult and error-prone, at least for laymen and
non-specialized medical practitioners. In an attempt to provide assistance to
gynecologic physicians treating endometriosis, this demo paper describes a
system that is trained to segment one frequently occurring visual appearance of
endometriosis, namely dark endometrial implants. The system is capable of
analyzing laparoscopic surgery videos, annotating identified implant regions
with multi-colored overlays and displaying a detection summary for improved
video browsing.

### [3] [Efficient Few-Shot Learning in Remote Sensing: Fusing Vision and Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13993)
*Jia Yun Chua,Argyrios Zolotas,Miguel Arana-Catania*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究提出结合传统视觉模型（YOLO）和视觉语言模型（LLaVA、ChatGPT、Gemini）的方法来增强遥感图像分析，特别是在飞机检测和场景理解方面，在标记和未标记数据以及图像退化场景中均取得显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 遥感技术在各领域应用广泛，但传统视觉模型需要大量领域特定标注数据且难以理解复杂环境上下文。视觉语言模型虽能整合视觉和文本数据，但在遥感领域的应用仍待探索。

Method: 将YOLO目标检测模型与视觉语言模型（LLaVA、ChatGPT、Gemini）相结合，在标记和未标记遥感数据以及图像退化场景下进行性能评估。

Result: 在飞机检测和计数准确性方面，所有模型平均MAE提升48.46%，在CLIPScore上获得6.17%的改进，特别是在挑战性条件和退化场景中表现优异。

Conclusion: 传统视觉模型与视觉语言模型的结合为更先进高效的遥感图像分析开辟了新途径，尤其在少样本学习场景中具有重要价值。

Abstract: Remote sensing has become a vital tool across sectors such as urban planning,
environmental monitoring, and disaster response. While the volume of data
generated has increased significantly, traditional vision models are often
constrained by the requirement for extensive domain-specific labelled data and
their limited ability to understand the context within complex environments.
Vision Language Models offer a complementary approach by integrating visual and
textual data; however, their application to remote sensing remains
underexplored, particularly given their generalist nature. This work
investigates the combination of vision models and VLMs to enhance image
analysis in remote sensing, with a focus on aircraft detection and scene
understanding. The integration of YOLO with VLMs such as LLaVA, ChatGPT, and
Gemini aims to achieve more accurate and contextually aware image
interpretation. Performance is evaluated on both labelled and unlabelled remote
sensing data, as well as degraded image scenarios which are crucial for remote
sensing. The findings show an average MAE improvement of 48.46% across models
in the accuracy of aircraft detection and counting, especially in challenging
conditions, in both raw and degraded scenarios. A 6.17% improvement in
CLIPScore for comprehensive understanding of remote sensing images is obtained.
The proposed approach combining traditional vision models and VLMs paves the
way for more advanced and efficient remote sensing image analysis, especially
in few-shot learning scenarios.

TL;DR: 开发并验证了一个基于AI的系统，用于检测前列腺癌中的筛状形态，该系统在内部和外部验证中表现出色，甚至超过了专家病理学家的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 前列腺癌中的筛状形态是一个预后不良的组织学特征，但在病理学家之间存在显著的观察者间变异性，导致报告不足。

Method: 使用EfficientNetV2-S编码器和多实例学习的深度学习模型，在640个数字化前列腺核心针活检切片上进行训练，并在内部和外部队列中进行验证。

Result: 模型在内部验证中AUC为0.97，Cohen's kappa为0.81；在外部验证中AUC为0.90，Cohen's kappa为0.55。在评分者间分析中，模型的表现优于所有九名病理学家。

Conclusion: 该AI模型在前列腺癌筛状形态检测方面达到了病理学家水平，有望提高诊断可靠性、标准化报告并改善治疗决策。

Abstract: Background: Cribriform morphology in prostate cancer is a histological
feature that indicates poor prognosis and contraindicates active surveillance.
However, it remains underreported and subject to significant interobserver
variability amongst pathologists. We aimed to develop and validate an AI-based
system to improve cribriform pattern detection.
  Methods: We created a deep learning model using an EfficientNetV2-S encoder
with multiple instance learning for end-to-end whole-slide classification. The
model was trained on 640 digitised prostate core needle biopsies from 430
patients, collected across three cohorts. It was validated internally (261
slides from 171 patients) and externally (266 slides, 104 patients from three
independent cohorts). Internal validation cohorts included laboratories or
scanners from the development set, while external cohorts used completely
independent instruments and laboratories. Annotations were provided by three
expert uropathologists with known high concordance. Additionally, we conducted
an inter-rater analysis and compared the model's performance against nine
expert uropathologists on 88 slides from the internal validation cohort.
  Results: The model showed strong internal validation performance (AUC: 0.97,
95% CI: 0.95-0.99; Cohen's kappa: 0.81, 95% CI: 0.72-0.89) and robust external
validation (AUC: 0.90, 95% CI: 0.86-0.93; Cohen's kappa: 0.55, 95% CI:
0.45-0.64). In our inter-rater analysis, the model achieved the highest average
agreement (Cohen's kappa: 0.66, 95% CI: 0.57-0.74), outperforming all nine
pathologists whose Cohen's kappas ranged from 0.35 to 0.62.
  Conclusion: Our AI model demonstrates pathologist-level performance for
cribriform morphology detection in prostate cancer. This approach could enhance
diagnostic reliability, standardise reporting, and improve treatment decisions
for prostate cancer patients.

### [5] [NAPPure: Adversarial Purification for Robust Image Classification under Non-Additive Perturbations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14025)
*Junjie Nan,Jianing Li,Wei Chen,Mingkun Zhang,Xueqi Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NAPPure是一个扩展的对抗净化框架，能够处理非加性对抗扰动（如模糊、遮挡、扭曲等），通过似然最大化分离干净图像和扰动参数，显著提升图像分类模型对非加性扰动的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的对抗净化方法主要针对加性扰动设计，但在现实世界中非加性扰动（模糊、遮挡、扭曲等）也很常见，现有方法对此效果不佳。

Method: 建立对抗图像的生成过程，通过似然最大化分离底层干净图像和扰动参数。

Result: 在GTSRB和CIFAR-10数据集上的实验表明，NAPPure显著提升了图像分类模型对非加性扰动的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: NAPPure框架成功扩展了对抗净化的适用范围，能够有效处理非加性扰动，填补了现有方法的空白。

Abstract: Adversarial purification has achieved great success in combating adversarial
image perturbations, which are usually assumed to be additive. However,
non-additive adversarial perturbations such as blur, occlusion, and distortion
are also common in the real world. Under such perturbations, existing
adversarial purification methods are much less effective since they are
designed to fit the additive nature. In this paper, we propose an extended
adversarial purification framework named NAPPure, which can further handle
non-additive perturbations. Specifically, we first establish the generation
process of an adversarial image, and then disentangle the underlying clean
image and perturbation parameters through likelihood maximization. Experiments
on GTSRB and CIFAR-10 datasets show that NAPPure significantly boosts the
robustness of image classification models against non-additive perturbations.

### [6] [Vgent: Graph-based Retrieval-Reasoning-Augmented Generation For Long Video Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14032)
*Xiaoqian Shen,Wenxuan Zhang,Jun Chen,Mohamed Elhoseiny*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vgent是一个基于图的检索-推理增强生成框架，通过结构化图表示视频并引入中间推理步骤，显著提升大视频语言模型对长视频的理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大视频语言模型处理长视频时面临的上下文窗口限制和长期序列信息保留困难，以及传统RAG方法在视频中面临的时间依赖破坏和无关信息干扰问题。

Method: 提出两个关键创新：1) 使用结构化图表示视频，保留视频片段间的语义关系；2) 引入中间推理步骤，通过结构化验证减少检索噪声，促进跨片段相关信息聚合。

Result: 在三个长视频理解基准测试中，相比基础模型性能提升3.0%~5.4%，相比最先进的视频RAG方法性能提升8.6%。

Conclusion: Vgent框架通过图结构表示和中间推理有效解决了长视频理解中的关键挑战，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Understanding and reasoning over long videos pose significant challenges for
large video language models (LVLMs) due to the difficulty in processing
intensive video tokens beyond context window and retaining long-term sequential
information. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has demonstrated
effectiveness in processing long context for Large Language Models (LLMs);
however, applying RAG to long video faces challenges such as disrupted temporal
dependencies and inclusion of irrelevant information that can hinder accurate
reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose Vgent, a novel graph-based
retrieval-reasoning-augmented generation framework to enhance LVLMs for long
video understanding. Our approach introduces two key innovations: (i) It
represents videos by structured graphs with semantic relationships across video
clips preserved to improve retrieval effectiveness. (ii) It introduces an
intermediate reasoning step to mitigate the reasoning limitation of LVLMs,
which leverages structured verification to reduce retrieval noise and
facilitate the explicit aggregation of relevant information across clips,
resulting in more accurate and context-aware responses. We comprehensively
evaluate our framework with various open-source LVLMs on three long-video
understanding benchmarks. Our approach yielded an overall performance
improvement of $3.0\%\sim 5.4\%$ over base models on MLVU, and outperformed
state-of-the-art video RAG methods by $8.6\%$. Our code is publicly available
at https://xiaoqian-shen.github.io/Vgent.

### [7] [Synchronization of Multiple Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14051)
*Avihai Naaman,Ron Shapira Weber,Oren Freifeld*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TPL是一种基于原型的时间对齐框架，通过构建共享的紧凑1D表示来同步不同场景或生成AI视频，无需穷举成对匹配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 同步来自不同场景或生成AI视频具有挑战性，因为存在多样化主题、背景和非线性时间错位。

Method: TPL从预训练模型提取的高维嵌入中构建共享的紧凑1D表示，通过学习统一原型序列来锚定关键动作阶段。

Result: 实验表明TPL在多样化数据集上提高了同步准确性、效率和鲁棒性，包括细粒度帧检索和阶段分类任务。

Conclusion: TPL是首个解决多个生成AI视频同步问题的方法，在视频同步领域具有重要贡献。

Abstract: Synchronizing videos captured simultaneously from multiple cameras in the
same scene is often easy and typically requires only simple time shifts.
However, synchronizing videos from different scenes or, more recently,
generative AI videos, poses a far more complex challenge due to diverse
subjects, backgrounds, and nonlinear temporal misalignment. We propose Temporal
Prototype Learning (TPL), a prototype-based framework that constructs a shared,
compact 1D representation from high-dimensional embeddings extracted by any of
various pretrained models. TPL robustly aligns videos by learning a unified
prototype sequence that anchors key action phases, thereby avoiding exhaustive
pairwise matching. Our experiments show that TPL improves synchronization
accuracy, efficiency, and robustness across diverse datasets, including
fine-grained frame retrieval and phase classification tasks. Importantly, TPL
is the first approach to mitigate synchronization issues in multiple generative
AI videos depicting the same action. Our code and a new multiple video
synchronization dataset are available at https://bgu-cs-vil.github.io/TPL/

TL;DR: 提出了一种从少量手机照片创建超真实、身份保持的3D头像的零样本方法，通过生成规范化模块和基于transformer的模型解决现有方法的几何不一致和细节缺失问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在单视图几何不一致和幻觉问题，以及合成数据训练模型无法捕捉高频细节如皮肤皱纹和细发，限制了真实感。

Method: 引入两个关键贡献：(1)生成规范化模块处理多视图为标准化表示；(2)基于transformer的模型在高质量高斯溅射头像数据集上训练，采用"捕获、规范化、溅射"流程。

Result: 从非结构化照片生成具有令人信服真实感和强大身份保持能力的静态四分之三身体头像。

Conclusion: 该方法在身份保持和真实感方面优于现有方法，为从少量照片创建高质量3D头像提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We present a novel, zero-shot pipeline for creating hyperrealistic,
identity-preserving 3D avatars from a few unstructured phone images. Existing
methods face several challenges: single-view approaches suffer from geometric
inconsistencies and hallucinations, degrading identity preservation, while
models trained on synthetic data fail to capture high-frequency details like
skin wrinkles and fine hair, limiting realism. Our method introduces two key
contributions: (1) a generative canonicalization module that processes multiple
unstructured views into a standardized, consistent representation, and (2) a
transformer-based model trained on a new, large-scale dataset of high-fidelity
Gaussian splatting avatars derived from dome captures of real people. This
"Capture, Canonicalize, Splat" pipeline produces static quarter-body avatars
with compelling realism and robust identity preservation from unstructured
photos.

TL;DR: cubic是一个开源的Python库，通过为SciPy和scikit-image API提供GPU加速的替代方案，解决了生物图像分析中的可扩展性和效率问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代显微镜生成的大型2D和3D数据集需要更高效的计算方法，现有工具缺乏API支持、GPU加速、3D处理能力和工作流互操作性。

Method: cubic扩展了SciPy和scikit-image API，使用CuPy和RAPIDS cuCIM提供设备无关的GPU加速操作，自动在GPU和CPU之间调度计算。

Result: 通过基准测试和现有去卷积和分割流程的复现，cubic实现了显著的加速效果，同时保持了算法保真度。

Conclusion: cubic为可扩展、可重现的生物图像分析建立了坚实基础，能够与Python科学计算生态系统集成，支持交互式探索和自动化高通量分析工作流。

Abstract: Quantitative analysis of multidimensional biological images is useful for
understanding complex cellular phenotypes and accelerating advances in
biomedical research. As modern microscopy generates ever-larger 2D and 3D
datasets, existing computational approaches are increasingly limited by their
scalability, efficiency, and integration with modern scientific computing
workflows. Existing bioimage analysis tools often lack application programmable
interfaces (APIs), do not support graphics processing unit (GPU) acceleration,
lack broad 3D image processing capabilities, and/or have poor interoperability
for compute-heavy workflows. Here, we introduce cubic, an open-source Python
library that addresses these challenges by augmenting widely used SciPy and
scikit-image APIs with GPU-accelerated alternatives from CuPy and RAPIDS cuCIM.
cubic's API is device-agnostic and dispatches operations to GPU when data
reside on the device and otherwise executes on CPU, seamlessly accelerating a
broad range of image processing routines. This approach enables GPU
acceleration of existing bioimage analysis workflows, from preprocessing to
segmentation and feature extraction for 2D and 3D data. We evaluate cubic both
by benchmarking individual operations and by reproducing existing deconvolution
and segmentation pipelines, achieving substantial speedups while maintaining
algorithmic fidelity. These advances establish a robust foundation for
scalable, reproducible bioimage analysis that integrates with the broader
Python scientific computing ecosystem, including other GPU-accelerated methods,
enabling both interactive exploration and automated high-throughput analysis
workflows. cubic is openly available at

Abstract: We introduce a framework that enables both multi-view character consistency
and 3D camera control in video diffusion models through a novel customization
data pipeline. We train the character consistency component with recorded
volumetric capture performances re-rendered with diverse camera trajectories
via 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS), lighting variability obtained with a video
relighting model. We fine-tune state-of-the-art open-source video diffusion
models on this data to provide strong multi-view identity preservation, precise
camera control, and lighting adaptability. Our framework also supports core
capabilities for virtual production, including multi-subject generation using
two approaches: joint training and noise blending, the latter enabling
efficient composition of independently customized models at inference time; it
also achieves scene and real-life video customization as well as control over
motion and spatial layout during customization. Extensive experiments show
improved video quality, higher personalization accuracy, and enhanced camera
control and lighting adaptability, advancing the integration of video
generation into virtual production. Our project page is available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种联合建模Big Five和HEXACO人格特质的多模态人格识别方法，通过优化联合识别来提高识别效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注Big Five人格特质，但缺乏对HEXACO（特别是诚实-谦逊特质）的关注，且两种人格模型在机器学习中的关系尚未明确。

Method: 采用联合建模方法，同时优化识别Big Five和HEXACO人格特质，利用多模态人类行为数据进行识别。

Result: 在自我介绍视频数据集上的实验表明，该方法能有效识别Big Five和HEXACO人格特质。

Conclusion: 联合建模Big Five和HEXACO的多模态人格识别方法是有效的，有助于提高对人类行为的理解。

Abstract: This paper proposes a joint modeling method of the Big Five, which has long
been studied, and HEXACO, which has recently attracted attention in psychology,
for automatically recognizing apparent personality traits from multimodal human
behavior. Most previous studies have used the Big Five for multimodal apparent
personality-trait recognition. However, no study has focused on apparent HEXACO
which can evaluate an Honesty-Humility trait related to displaced aggression
and vengefulness, social-dominance orientation, etc. In addition, the
relationships between the Big Five and HEXACO when modeled by machine learning
have not been clarified. We expect awareness of multimodal human behavior to
improve by considering these relationships. The key advance of our proposed
method is to optimize jointly recognizing the Big Five and HEXACO. Experiments
using a self-introduction video dataset demonstrate that the proposed method
can effectively recognize the Big Five and HEXACO.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于重建误差的AI图像检测方法计算成本高且无法捕捉原始图像中的固有噪声特征，需要更高效准确的解决方案。

Method: 使用位平面图像处理提取噪声特征，设计最大梯度补丁选择来放大噪声信号，并构建轻量级分类头进行检测。

Conclusion: 该方法通过位平面噪声分析实现了高效准确的AI生成图像检测，具有优秀的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of GAN and Diffusion models makes it more difficult to
distinguish AI-generated images from real ones. Recent studies often use
image-based reconstruction errors as an important feature for determining
whether an image is AI-generated. However, these approaches typically incur
high computational costs and also fail to capture intrinsic noisy features
present in the raw images. To solve these problems, we innovatively refine
error extraction by using bit-plane-based image processing, as lower bit planes
indeed represent noise patterns in images. We introduce an effective bit-planes
guided noisy image generation and exploit various image normalization
strategies, including scaling and thresholding. Then, to amplify the noise
signal for easier AI-generated image detection, we design a maximum gradient
patch selection that applies multi-directional gradients to compute the noise
score and selects the region with the highest score. Finally, we propose a
lightweight and effective classification head and explore two different
structures: noise-based classifier and noise-guided classifier. Extensive
experiments on the GenImage benchmark demonstrate the outstanding performance
of our method, which achieves an average accuracy of \textbf{98.9\%}
(\textbf{11.9}\%~$\uparrow$) and shows excellent cross-generator generalization
capability. Particularly, our method achieves an accuracy of over 98.2\% from
GAN to Diffusion and over 99.2\% from Diffusion to GAN. Moreover, it performs
error extraction at the millisecond level, nearly a hundred times faster than
existing methods. The code is at https://github.com/hongsong-wang/LOTA.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为PIA的多模态音频-视觉框架，结合语言、动态面部运动和面部识别线索来检测深度伪造视频，解决了传统检测方法对先进生成模型生成的深度伪造检测不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度伪造检测方法依赖手动设计的音素-视素对齐阈值、基础帧级一致性检查或单模态检测策略，无法有效识别由GANs、扩散模型和神经渲染技术等先进生成模型生成的现代深度伪造内容。

Method: 采用多模态音频-视觉框架PIA，整合音素序列、唇部几何数据和先进的面部身份嵌入，通过识别多个互补模态间的不一致性来检测深度伪造。

Result: 该方法显著提高了对细微深度伪造篡改的检测能力，能够识别传统检测器经常忽略的微小时间差异。

Conclusion: PIA框架通过整合多模态信息，为检测先进生成模型产生的深度伪造内容提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The rise of manipulated media has made deepfakes a particularly insidious
threat, involving various generative manipulations such as lip-sync
modifications, face-swaps, and avatar-driven facial synthesis. Conventional
detection methods, which predominantly depend on manually designed
phoneme-viseme alignment thresholds, fundamental frame-level consistency
checks, or a unimodal detection strategy, inadequately identify modern-day
deepfakes generated by advanced generative models such as GANs, diffusion
models, and neural rendering techniques. These advanced techniques generate
nearly perfect individual frames yet inadvertently create minor temporal
discrepancies frequently overlooked by traditional detectors. We present a
novel multimodal audio-visual framework, Phoneme-Temporal and Identity-Dynamic
Analysis(PIA), incorporating language, dynamic face motion, and facial
identification cues to address these limitations. We utilize phoneme sequences,
lip geometry data, and advanced facial identity embeddings. This integrated
method significantly improves the detection of subtle deepfake alterations by
identifying inconsistencies across multiple complementary modalities. Code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于事件的OCC系统使用常规调制方案如OOK和PPM，但未能充分利用事件视觉传感器的独特特性，需要专门设计的调制方案

Method: 提出EIM调制方案，通过调制事件间隔来编码信息；调整EVS参数以优化EIM的频率响应；实验确定EIM的最大调制阶数；基于获得的参数进行传输实验

Result: 在室内环境中实现了28 kbps（10米）和8.4 kbps（50米）的成功传输，创下了基于事件OCC系统的比特率新纪录

Conclusion: EIM方案能够充分利用EVS的独特特性，显著提升了基于事件OCC系统的传输性能，为高速可见光通信提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: Optical camera communication (OCC) represents a promising visible light
communication technology. Nonetheless, typical OCC systems utilizing
frame-based cameras are encumbered by limitations, including low bit rate and
high processing load. To address these issues, OCC system utilizing an
event-based vision sensor (EVS) as receivers have been proposed. The EVS
enables high-speed, low-latency, and robust communication due to its
asynchronous operation and high dynamic range. In existing event-based OCC
systems, conventional modulation schemes such as on-off keying (OOK) and pulse
position modulation have been applied, however, to the best of our knowledge,
no modulation method has been proposed that fully exploits the unique
characteristics of the EVS. This paper proposes a novel modulation scheme,
called the event interval modulation (EIM) scheme, specifically designed for
event-based OCC. EIM enables improvement in transmission speed by modulating
information using the intervals between events. This paper proposes a
theoretical model of EIM and conducts a proof-of-concept experiment. First, the
parameters of the EVS are tuned and customized to optimize the frequency
response specifically for EIM. Then, the maximum modulation order usable in EIM
is determined experimentally. We conduct transmission experiments based on the
obtained parameters. Finally, we report successful transmission at 28 kbps over
10 meters and 8.4 kbps over 50 meters in an indoor environment. This sets a new
benchmark for bit rate in event-based OCC systems.

TL;DR: 提出MACE方法，通过混合专家网络实现大规模场景的高效定位和高质量渲染，显著降低计算成本并保持高精度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模场景中定位和渲染的计算成本高的问题，传统场景坐标回归方法在扩展到大规模场景时受限于单个网络的容量

Method: 引入门控网络隐式分类和选择子网络，确保每次推理只激活单个子网络；提出无辅助损失负载均衡策略(ALF-LB)提升定位精度

Result: 在剑桥测试集上仅需10分钟训练即可获得高质量渲染结果，显著降低计算成本同时保持更高精度

Conclusion: MACE框架为大规模场景应用提供了高效的解决方案，在减少成本的同时维持了高精度定位和渲染质量

Abstract: Efficient localization and high-quality rendering in large-scale scenes
remain a significant challenge due to the computational cost involved. While
Scene Coordinate Regression (SCR) methods perform well in small-scale
localization, they are limited by the capacity of a single network when
extended to large-scale scenes. To address these challenges, we propose the
Mixed Expert-based Accelerated Coordinate Encoding method (MACE), which enables
efficient localization and high-quality rendering in large-scale scenes.
Inspired by the remarkable capabilities of MOE in large model domains, we
introduce a gating network to implicitly classify and select sub-networks,
ensuring that only a single sub-network is activated during each inference.
Furtheremore, we present Auxiliary-Loss-Free Load Balancing(ALF-LB) strategy to
enhance the localization accuracy on large-scale scene. Our framework provides
a significant reduction in costs while maintaining higher precision, offering
an efficient solution for large-scale scene applications. Additional
experiments on the Cambridge test set demonstrate that our method achieves
high-quality rendering results with merely 10 minutes of training.

<details>

Motivation: 现有图像到视频生成模型在人脸身份一致性保持方面存在困难，特别是当人脸在图像中占比较小且视频中人物表情和动作变化较大时

Method: 基于强化学习的身份保持奖励引导优化框架，使用人脸身份评分器优化扩散模型，通过反向传播奖励信号和KL散度正则化稳定训练

Result: 在Wan 2.2 I2V模型和内部I2V模型上的广泛实验证明了方法的有效性

Conclusion: IPRO框架能够有效提升图像到视频生成中的人脸身份一致性，无需引入额外模块或改变模型架构

Abstract: Recent advances in image-to-video (I2V) generation have achieved remarkable
progress in synthesizing high-quality, temporally coherent videos from static
images. Among all the applications of I2V, human-centric video generation
includes a large portion. However, existing I2V models encounter difficulties
in maintaining identity consistency between the input human image and the
generated video, especially when the person in the video exhibits significant
expression changes and movements. This issue becomes critical when the human
face occupies merely a small fraction of the image. Since humans are highly
sensitive to identity variations, this poses a critical yet under-explored
challenge in I2V generation. In this paper, we propose Identity-Preserving
Reward-guided Optimization (IPRO), a novel video diffusion framework based on
reinforcement learning to enhance identity preservation. Instead of introducing
auxiliary modules or altering model architectures, our approach introduces a
direct and effective tuning algorithm that optimizes diffusion models using a
face identity scorer. To improve performance and accelerate convergence, our
method backpropagates the reward signal through the last steps of the sampling
chain, enabling richer gradient feedback. We also propose a novel facial
scoring mechanism that treats faces in ground-truth videos as facial feature
pools, providing multi-angle facial information to enhance generalization. A
KL-divergence regularization is further incorporated to stabilize training and
prevent overfitting to the reward signal. Extensive experiments on Wan 2.2 I2V
model and our in-house I2V model demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

Motivation: 现有方法如VACE和Phantom在特定主题的多样化场景视频生成方面取得进展，但在多人物动态互动中难以保持身份一致性，这对多角色一致身份至关重要。

Method: 构建基于大规模偏好数据集的视频奖励模型，包含人工标注和合成失真数据，采用针对多人物一致性优化的GRPO变体来增强VACE和Phantom。

Result: 实验显示Identity-GRPO在人类一致性指标上比基线方法提升高达18.9%，并通过消融研究评估了标注质量和设计选择对策略优化的影响。

Conclusion: 该方法为将强化学习与个性化视频生成对齐提供了可行见解，显著提升了多人物身份保持能力。

Abstract: While advanced methods like VACE and Phantom have advanced video generation
for specific subjects in diverse scenarios, they struggle with multi-human
identity preservation in dynamic interactions, where consistent identities
across multiple characters are critical. To address this, we propose
Identity-GRPO, a human feedback-driven optimization pipeline for refining
multi-human identity-preserving video generation. First, we construct a video
reward model trained on a large-scale preference dataset containing
human-annotated and synthetic distortion data, with pairwise annotations
focused on maintaining human consistency throughout the video. We then employ a
GRPO variant tailored for multi-human consistency, which greatly enhances both
VACE and Phantom. Through extensive ablation studies, we evaluate the impact of
annotation quality and design choices on policy optimization. Experiments show
that Identity-GRPO achieves up to 18.9% improvement in human consistency
metrics over baseline methods, offering actionable insights for aligning
reinforcement learning with personalized video generation.

TL;DR: 提出MatchAttention机制和MatchDecoder，通过动态匹配相对位置和滑动窗口注意力采样，解决高分辨率图像跨视图匹配的二次复杂度和遮挡问题，在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高分辨率图像的跨视图匹配面临二次复杂度和缺乏显式匹配约束的挑战，现有交叉注意力机制难以有效处理这些问题。

Method: 提出MatchAttention机制动态匹配相对位置，使用BilinearSoftmax实现连续可微的滑动窗口注意力采样，设计MatchDecoder作为层次化跨视图解码器，并引入门控交叉MatchAttention和一致性约束损失处理遮挡问题。

Result: MatchStereo-B在Middlebury基准测试中平均误差排名第一，KITTI分辨率推理仅需29ms；MatchStereo-T仅用3GB GPU内存在0.1秒内处理4K UHD图像；在KITTI 2012、KITTI 2015、ETH3D和Spring flow数据集上均达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了高精度、低计算复杂度的实时高分辨率跨视图匹配，为相关应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Cross-view matching is fundamentally achieved through cross-attention
mechanisms. However, matching of high-resolution images remains challenging due
to the quadratic complexity and lack of explicit matching constraints in the
existing cross-attention. This paper proposes an attention mechanism,
MatchAttention, that dynamically matches relative positions. The relative
position determines the attention sampling center of the key-value pairs given
a query. Continuous and differentiable sliding-window attention sampling is
achieved by the proposed BilinearSoftmax. The relative positions are
iteratively updated through residual connections across layers by embedding
them into the feature channels. Since the relative position is exactly the
learning target for cross-view matching, an efficient hierarchical cross-view
decoder, MatchDecoder, is designed with MatchAttention as its core component.
To handle cross-view occlusions, gated cross-MatchAttention and a
consistency-constrained loss are proposed. These two components collectively
mitigate the impact of occlusions in both forward and backward passes, allowing
the model to focus more on learning matching relationships. When applied to
stereo matching, MatchStereo-B ranked 1st in average error on the public
Middlebury benchmark and requires only 29ms for KITTI-resolution inference.
MatchStereo-T can process 4K UHD images in 0.1 seconds using only 3GB of GPU
memory. The proposed models also achieve state-of-the-art performance on KITTI
2012, KITTI 2015, ETH3D, and Spring flow datasets. The combination of high
accuracy and low computational complexity makes real-time, high-resolution, and
high-accuracy cross-view matching possible. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高斯溅射在大规模数据集上表现良好，但在稀疏覆盖区域难以捕捉细节或保持真实感，主要受限于稀疏3D训练数据的固有局限性。

Method: 集成2D计算机视觉技术（凸滤波和DINO等基础模型的语义特征监督），利用2D分割先验和高维特征嵌入来指导高斯溅射的密度化和细化过程。

Result: 在三个数据集上的验证表明，GauSSmart在大多数评估场景中持续优于现有高斯溅射方法。

Conclusion: 混合2D-3D方法具有显著潜力，2D基础模型与3D重建管道的深思熟虑结合可以克服各自方法的固有局限性。

Abstract: Scene reconstruction has emerged as a central challenge in computer vision,
with approaches such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and Gaussian Splatting
achieving remarkable progress. While Gaussian Splatting demonstrates strong
performance on large-scale datasets, it often struggles to capture fine details
or maintain realism in regions with sparse coverage, largely due to the
inherent limitations of sparse 3D training data.
  In this work, we propose GauSSmart, a hybrid method that effectively bridges
2D foundational models and 3D Gaussian Splatting reconstruction. Our approach
integrates established 2D computer vision techniques, including convex
filtering and semantic feature supervision from foundational models such as
DINO, to enhance Gaussian-based scene reconstruction. By leveraging 2D
segmentation priors and high-dimensional feature embeddings, our method guides
the densification and refinement of Gaussian splats, improving coverage in
underrepresented areas and preserving intricate structural details.
  We validate our approach across three datasets, where GauSSmart consistently
outperforms existing Gaussian Splatting in the majority of evaluated scenes.
Our results demonstrate the significant potential of hybrid 2D-3D approaches,
highlighting how the thoughtful combination of 2D foundational models with 3D
reconstruction pipelines can overcome the limitations inherent in either
approach alone.

Result: 在CAMELYON17和私有病理数据集上验证，在未见域上实现一致性能提升，最高达到7%的改进。

Conclusion: 因果推断是解决组织病理学图像分析中领域偏移问题的有力工具。

Abstract: Domain shift in histopathology, often caused by differences in acquisition
processes or data sources, poses a major challenge to the generalization
ability of deep learning models. Existing methods primarily rely on modeling
statistical correlations by aligning feature distributions or introducing
statistical variation, yet they often overlook causal relationships. In this
work, we propose a novel causal-inference-based framework that leverages
semantic features while mitigating the impact of confounders. Our method
implements the front-door principle by designing transformation strategies that
explicitly incorporate mediators and observed tissue slides. We validate our
method on the CAMELYON17 dataset and a private histopathology dataset,
demonstrating consistent performance gains across unseen domains. As a result,
our approach achieved up to a 7% improvement in both the CAMELYON17 dataset and
the private histopathology dataset, outperforming existing baselines. These
results highlight the potential of causal inference as a powerful tool for
addressing domain shift in histopathology image analysis.

Result: 在POPE、MME和AMBER等公开基准测试中，该方法在减少LVLM幻觉方面达到了最先进的性能，并生成更具视觉基础的回答。

Conclusion: 提出的三层对比解码方法能有效减少大型视觉语言模型的幻觉问题，提高输出的视觉基础性，无需额外训练即可实现性能提升。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have recently shown promising results on
various multimodal tasks, even achieving human-comparable performance in
certain cases. Nevertheless, LVLMs remain prone to hallucinations -- they often
rely heavily on a single modality or memorize training data without properly
grounding their outputs. To address this, we propose a training-free, tri-layer
contrastive decoding with watermarking, which proceeds in three steps: (1)
select a mature layer and an amateur layer among the decoding layers, (2)
identify a pivot layer using a watermark-related question to assess whether the
layer is visually well-grounded, and (3) apply tri-layer contrastive decoding
to generate the final output. Experiments on public benchmarks such as POPE,
MME and AMBER demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance
in reducing hallucinations in LVLMs and generates more visually grounded
responses.

Motivation: 虹膜生物识别系统面临呈现攻击威胁，但缺乏足够的训练和评估数据集，因为构建和成像呈现攻击存在困难。

Method: 使用多领域图像转换扩散StyleGAN，结合扩散模型和GAN的优势，通过多领域架构实现真实眼部图像与不同呈现攻击领域之间的转换，采用针对眼部数据的自适应损失函数。

Result: 在LivDet2020数据集上，1%误检率下的真检率从93.41%提升至98.72%，显著提高了呈现攻击检测系统的性能。

Conclusion: MID-StyleGAN能生成高质量合成眼部图像，有效解决虹膜和眼部生物识别中的数据稀缺问题，为呈现攻击检测提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: An iris biometric system can be compromised by presentation attacks (PAs)
where artifacts such as artificial eyes, printed eye images, or cosmetic
contact lenses are presented to the system. To counteract this, several
presentation attack detection (PAD) methods have been developed. However, there
is a scarcity of datasets for training and evaluating iris PAD techniques due
to the implicit difficulties in constructing and imaging PAs. To address this,
we introduce the Multi-domain Image Translative Diffusion StyleGAN
(MID-StyleGAN), a new framework for generating synthetic ocular images that
captures the PA and bonafide characteristics in multiple domains such as
bonafide, printed eyes and cosmetic contact lens. MID-StyleGAN combines the
strengths of diffusion models and generative adversarial networks (GANs) to
produce realistic and diverse synthetic data. Our approach utilizes a
multi-domain architecture that enables the translation between bonafide ocular
images and different PA domains. The model employs an adaptive loss function
tailored for ocular data to maintain domain consistency. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that MID-StyleGAN outperforms existing methods in generating
high-quality synthetic ocular images. The generated data was used to
significantly enhance the performance of PAD systems, providing a scalable
solution to the data scarcity problem in iris and ocular biometrics. For
example, on the LivDet2020 dataset, the true detect rate at 1% false detect
rate improved from 93.41% to 98.72%, showcasing the impact of the proposed
method.

Result: 大量实验表明VaCo显著提升了不同多模态大语言模型在各种基准测试上的性能

Conclusion: VaCo展示了在视觉理解方面的卓越能力，为多模态大语言模型的视觉中心优化提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) integrate image features from visual
encoders with LLMs, demonstrating advanced comprehension capabilities. However,
mainstream MLLMs are solely supervised by the next-token prediction of textual
tokens, neglecting critical vision-centric information essential for analytical
abilities. To track this dilemma, we introduce VaCo, which optimizes MLLM
representations through Vision-Centric activation and Coordination from
multiple vision foundation models (VFMs). VaCo introduces visual discriminative
alignment to integrate task-aware perceptual features extracted from VFMs,
thereby unifying the optimization of both textual and visual outputs in MLLMs.
Specifically, we incorporate the learnable Modular Task Queries (MTQs) and
Visual Alignment Layers (VALs) into MLLMs, activating specific visual signals
under the supervision of diverse VFMs. To coordinate representation conflicts
across VFMs, the crafted Token Gateway Mask (TGM) restricts the information
flow among multiple groups of MTQs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VaCo
significantly improves the performance of different MLLMs on various
benchmarks, showcasing its superior capabilities in visual comprehension.

Abstract: With the rise in consumer depth cameras, a wealth of unlabeled RGB-D data has
become available. This prompts the question of how to utilize this data for
geometric reasoning of scenes. While many RGB-D registration meth- ods rely on
geometric and feature-based similarity, we take a different approach. We use
cycle-consistent keypoints as salient points to enforce spatial coherence
constraints during matching, improving correspondence accuracy. Additionally,
we introduce a novel pose block that combines a GRU recurrent unit with
transformation synchronization, blending historical and multi-view data. Our
approach surpasses previous self- supervised registration methods on ScanNet
and 3DMatch, even outperforming some older supervised methods. We also
integrate our components into existing methods, showing their effectiveness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注调整MLLMs以建模预标注的指令数据来注入空间知识，而没有直接监督MLLMs的实际响应，导致在细粒度空间感知能力上不足。

Method: SPR引入语义和定位分数来全面评估MLLM生成描述中的文本质量和定位质量，通过直接偏好优化将最佳得分细化与最低得分初始描述配对。

Result: 在标准引用和定位基准上的广泛实验表明，SPR以最小的训练开销有效提高了MLLM的空间理解能力。

Conclusion: SPR方法通过空间偏好奖励机制成功增强了MLLMs的细粒度空间感知能力，在保持训练效率的同时显著提升了空间理解性能。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models~(MLLMs) have demonstrated promising spatial
understanding capabilities, such as referencing and grounding object
descriptions. Despite their successes, MLLMs still fall short in fine-grained
spatial perception abilities, such as generating detailed region descriptions
or accurately localizing objects. Additionally, they often fail to respond to
the user's requirements for desired fine-grained spatial understanding. This
issue might arise because existing approaches primarily focus on tuning MLLMs
to model pre-annotated instruction data to inject spatial knowledge, without
direct supervision of MLLMs' actual responses. We address this issue by SPR, a
Spatial Preference Rewarding~(SPR) approach that enhances MLLMs' spatial
capabilities by rewarding MLLMs' detailed responses with precise object
localization over vague or inaccurate responses. With randomly selected image
regions and region descriptions from MLLMs, SPR introduces semantic and
localization scores to comprehensively evaluate the text quality and
localization quality in MLLM-generated descriptions. We also refine the MLLM
descriptions with better localization accuracy and pair the best-scored
refinement with the initial descriptions of the lowest score for direct
preference optimization, thereby enhancing fine-grained alignment with visual
input. Extensive experiments over standard referring and grounding benchmarks
show that SPR improves MLLM spatial understanding capabilities effectively with
minimal overhead in training. Data and code will be released at

Motivation: 现有文本到图像生成模型在处理多对象提示时经常出现对象遗漏或对象混合的问题，特别是在相似形状、相似纹理、不同背景偏差和多个对象等场景下。

Method: 提出DOS方法，基于对CLIP嵌入的两个关键观察，在将文本嵌入输入文本到图像模型之前修改三种类型的CLIP文本嵌入。

Result: 实验结果显示DOS持续提高了多对象图像生成的成功率并减少了对象混合。在人类评估中，DOS在四个基准测试中比其他四种竞争方法多获得26.24%-43.04%的投票。

Conclusion: DOS是改善多对象图像生成的实用有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent progress in text-to-image (T2I) generative models has led to
significant improvements in generating high-quality images aligned with text
prompts. However, these models still struggle with prompts involving multiple
objects, often resulting in object neglect or object mixing. Through extensive
studies, we identify four problematic scenarios, Similar Shapes, Similar
Textures, Dissimilar Background Biases, and Many Objects, where inter-object
relationships frequently lead to such failures. Motivated by two key
observations about CLIP embeddings, we propose DOS (Directional Object
Separation), a method that modifies three types of CLIP text embeddings before
passing them into text-to-image models. Experimental results show that DOS
consistently improves the success rate of multi-object image generation and
reduces object mixing. In human evaluations, DOS significantly outperforms four
competing methods, receiving 26.24%-43.04% more votes across four benchmarks.
These results highlight DOS as a practical and effective solution for improving
multi-object image generation.

Abstract: Accurate brain tumor segmentation is significant for clinical diagnosis and
treatment. It is challenging due to the heterogeneity of tumor subregions.
Mamba-based State Space Models have demonstrated promising performance.
However, they incur significant computational overhead due to sequential
feature computation across multiple spatial axes. Moreover, their robustness
across diverse BraTS data partitions remains largely unexplored, leaving a
critical gap in reliable evaluation. To address these limitations, we propose
dual-resolution bi-directional Mamba (DRBD-Mamba), an efficient 3D segmentation
model that captures multi-scale long-range dependencies with minimal
computational overhead. We leverage a space-filling curve to preserve spatial
locality during 3D-to-1D feature mapping, thereby reducing reliance on
computationally expensive multi-axial feature scans. To enrich feature
representation, we propose a gated fusion module that adaptively integrates
forward and reverse contexts, along with a quantization block that discretizes
features to improve robustness. In addition, we propose five systematic folds
on BraTS2023 for rigorous evaluation of segmentation techniques under diverse
conditions and present detailed analysis of common failure scenarios. On the

Abstract: Motherboard defect detection is critical for ensuring reliability in
high-volume electronics manufacturing. While prior research in PCB inspection
has largely targeted bare-board or trace-level defects, assembly-level
inspection of full motherboards inspection remains underexplored. In this work,
we present BoardVision, a reproducible framework for detecting assembly-level
defects such as missing screws, loose fan wiring, and surface scratches. We
benchmark two representative detectors - YOLOv7 and Faster R-CNN, under
controlled conditions on the MiracleFactory motherboard dataset, providing the
first systematic comparison in this domain. To mitigate the limitations of
single models, where YOLO excels in precision but underperforms in recall and
Faster R-CNN shows the reverse, we propose a lightweight ensemble,
Confidence-Temporal Voting (CTV Voter), that balances precision and recall
through interpretable rules. We further evaluate robustness under realistic
perturbations including sharpness, brightness, and orientation changes,
highlighting stability challenges often overlooked in motherboard defect
detection. Finally, we release a deployable GUI-driven inspection tool that
bridges research evaluation with operator usability. Together, these
contributions demonstrate how computer vision techniques can transition from
benchmark results to practical quality assurance for assembly-level motherboard
manufacturing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算病理学面临全切片图像计算瓶颈和密集标注稀缺的问题，现有方法忽视多放大倍数下的细粒度信息和肿瘤微环境变化。

Method: 采用易到难的渐进表示学习，结合双课程对比多实例学习，直接将千兆像素级全切片图像转换为预后预测。

Result: 在12种癌症类型（5,954患者，1,254万图块）上验证，DCMIL优于标准预后模型，能识别细粒度预后相关区域并提供稳健的不确定性估计。

Conclusion: DCMIL能有效处理全切片图像，识别形态学差异，有潜力生成新的生物学见解，所有代码已公开。

Abstract: The burgeoning discipline of computational pathology shows promise in
harnessing whole slide images (WSIs) to quantify morphological heterogeneity
and develop objective prognostic modes for human cancers. However, progress is
impeded by the computational bottleneck of gigapixel-size inputs and the
scarcity of dense manual annotations. Current methods often overlook
fine-grained information across multi-magnification WSIs and variations in
tumor microenvironments. Here, we propose an easy-to-hard progressive
representation learning model, termed dual-curriculum contrastive
multi-instance learning (DCMIL), to efficiently process WSIs for cancer
prognosis. The model does not rely on dense annotations and enables the direct
transformation of gigapixel-size WSIs into outcome predictions. Extensive
experiments on twelve cancer types (5,954 patients, 12.54 million tiles)
demonstrate that DCMIL outperforms standard WSI-based prognostic models.
Additionally, DCMIL identifies fine-grained prognosis-salient regions, provides
robust instance uncertainty estimation, and captures morphological differences
between normal and tumor tissues, with the potential to generate new biological
insights. All codes have been made publicly accessible at

*Hui Xiang,Yifan Bian,Li Li,Jingran Wu,Xianguo Zhang,Dong Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种统一帧内和帧间编码的神经视频压缩框架，通过自适应帧内/帧间编码和双向帧间压缩设计，显著提升了压缩效率并解决了现有神经视频压缩方案的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经视频压缩方案在处理遮挡、新内容、帧间误差传播等方面存在局限性，需要借鉴传统视频编码中帧内编码的优势来解决这些问题。

Method: 提出统一帧内和帧间编码的NVC框架，每个帧由单一模型自适应处理帧内/帧间编码；同时采用双向帧间压缩设计，充分利用前后帧间的冗余信息。

Result: 实验结果显示，该方案相比DCVC-RT平均降低10.7%的BD-rate，提供更稳定的比特率和每帧质量，同时保持实时编码/解码性能。

Conclusion: 提出的统一帧内/帧间编码框架有效解决了神经视频压缩中的关键问题，显著提升了压缩效率和稳定性，同时保持了实时性能。

Abstract: Neural video compression (NVC) technologies have advanced rapidly in recent
years, yielding state-of-the-art schemes such as DCVC-RT that offer superior
compression efficiency to H.266/VVC and real-time encoding/decoding
capabilities. Nonetheless, existing NVC schemes have several limitations,
including inefficiency in dealing with disocclusion and new content, interframe
error propagation and accumulation, among others. To eliminate these
limitations, we borrow the idea from classic video coding schemes, which allow
intra coding within inter-coded frames. With the intra coding tool enabled,
disocclusion and new content are properly handled, and interframe error
propagation is naturally intercepted without the need for manual refresh
mechanisms. We present an NVC framework with unified intra and inter coding,
where every frame is processed by a single model that is trained to perform
intra/inter coding adaptively. Moreover, we propose a simultaneous two-frame
compression design to exploit interframe redundancy not only forwardly but also
backwardly. Experimental results show that our scheme outperforms DCVC-RT by an
average of 10.7\% BD-rate reduction, delivers more stable bitrate and quality
per frame, and retains real-time encoding/decoding performances. Code and
models will be released.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频目标检测在安全关键应用中至关重要，但基于深度学习的检测器容易受到对抗攻击，特别是通用扰动攻击。现有方法在效果和隐蔽性方面存在不足。

Method: 使用核范数正则化促进集中在背景的结构化扰动，采用自适应乐观指数梯度方法进行高效优化，提高可扩展性和收敛性。

Result: 所提出的攻击方法在效果上优于低秩投影梯度下降和Frank-Wolfe攻击方法，同时保持高隐蔽性。

Conclusion: 该方法为视频目标检测提供了一种有效且隐蔽的通用对抗攻击方案，代码和数据已公开。

Abstract: Video-based object detection plays a vital role in safety-critical
applications. While deep learning-based object detectors have achieved
impressive performance, they remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks,
particularly those involving universal perturbations. In this work, we propose
a minimally distorted universal adversarial attack tailored for video object
detection, which leverages nuclear norm regularization to promote structured
perturbations concentrated in the background. To optimize this formulation
efficiently, we employ an adaptive, optimistic exponentiated gradient method
that enhances both scalability and convergence. Our results demonstrate that
the proposed attack outperforms both low-rank projected gradient descent and
Frank-Wolfe based attacks in effectiveness while maintaining high stealthiness.

Abstract: Unsupervised deep generative models are emerging as a promising alternative
to supervised methods for detecting and segmenting anomalies in brain imaging.
Unlike fully supervised approaches, which require large voxel-level annotated
datasets and are limited to well-characterised pathologies, these models can be
trained exclusively on healthy data and identify anomalies as deviations from
learned normative brain structures. This PRISMA-guided scoping review
synthesises recent work on unsupervised deep generative models for anomaly
detection in neuroimaging, including autoencoders, variational autoencoders,
generative adversarial networks, and denoising diffusion models. A total of 49
studies published between 2018 - 2025 were identified, covering applications to
brain MRI and, less frequently, CT across diverse pathologies such as tumours,
stroke, multiple sclerosis, and small vessel disease. Reported performance
metrics are compared alongside architectural design choices. Across the
included studies, generative models achieved encouraging performance for large
focal lesions and demonstrated progress in addressing more subtle
abnormalities. A key strength of generative models is their ability to produce
interpretable pseudo-healthy (also referred to as counterfactual)
reconstructions, which is particularly valuable when annotated data are scarce,
as in rare or heterogeneous diseases. Looking ahead, these models offer a
compelling direction for anomaly detection, enabling semi-supervised learning,
supporting the discovery of novel imaging biomarkers, and facilitating within-
and cross-disease deviation mapping in unified end-to-end frameworks. To
realise clinical impact, future work should prioritise anatomy-aware modelling,
development of foundation models, task-appropriate evaluation metrics, and
rigorous clinical validation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多任务图像恢复模型虽然能同时处理多种图像退化问题，但通常参数量过大导致计算效率低下，需要压缩模型以提高计算效率。

Method: 使用迭代剪枝策略，通过多轮剪除低幅值权重并将剩余权重重置为原始初始化，发现能够匹配或超越密集模型性能的稀疏子网络。

Result: 在去雨、去雾和去噪任务的基准数据集上，MIR-L仅保留10%可训练参数的同时仍能保持高图像恢复性能。

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了多任务图像恢复模型的高效压缩，在极高稀疏度下仍能维持或超越最先进性能。

Abstract: Image quality is a critical factor in delivering visually appealing content
on web platforms. However, images often suffer from degradation due to lossy
operations applied by online social networks (OSNs), negatively affecting user
experience. Image restoration is the process of recovering a clean high-quality
image from a given degraded input. Recently, multi-task (all-in-one) image
restoration models have gained significant attention, due to their ability to
simultaneously handle different types of image degradations. However, these
models often come with an excessively high number of trainable parameters,
making them computationally inefficient. In this paper, we propose a strategy
for compressing multi-task image restoration models. We aim to discover highly
sparse subnetworks within overparameterized deep models that can match or even
surpass the performance of their dense counterparts. The proposed model, namely
MIR-L, utilizes an iterative pruning strategy that removes low-magnitude
weights across multiple rounds, while resetting the remaining weights to their
original initialization. This iterative process is important for the multi-task
image restoration model's optimization, effectively uncovering "winning
tickets" that maintain or exceed state-of-the-art performance at high sparsity
levels. Experimental evaluation on benchmark datasets for the deraining,
dehazing, and denoising tasks shows that MIR-L retains only 10% of the
trainable parameters while maintaining high image restoration performance. Our
code, datasets and pre-trained models are made publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 放牧活动同时影响农业生产和生物多样性，但目前缺乏可扩展的放牧监测方法。研究旨在利用免费卫星数据开发可靠的放牧检测系统，以指导保护性土地利用合规检查。

Method: 使用Sentinel-2 L2A时间序列数据（4-10月），对每个多边形定义的牧场边界进行二元分类（放牧/未放牧）。训练CNN-LSTM集成模型处理多时相反射特征。

Result: 模型在五个验证分割上平均F1得分为77%，对放牧牧场的召回率达到90%。在仅能检查4%场地的情况下，优先检查模型预测为未放牧的场地，确认的未放牧场地数量比随机检查多17.2倍。

Conclusion: 粗分辨率免费卫星数据能够可靠地指导检查资源分配，用于保护性土地利用合规监测。代码和模型已公开。

Abstract: Grazing shapes both agricultural production and biodiversity, yet scalable
monitoring of where grazing occurs remains limited. We study seasonal grazing
detection from Sentinel-2 L2A time series: for each polygon-defined field
boundary, April-October imagery is used for binary prediction (grazed / not
grazed). We train an ensemble of CNN-LSTM models on multi-temporal reflectance
features, and achieve an average F1 score of 77 percent across five validation
splits, with 90 percent recall on grazed pastures. Operationally, if inspectors
can visit at most 4 percent of sites annually, prioritising fields predicted by
our model as non-grazed yields 17.2 times more confirmed non-grazing sites than
random inspection. These results indicate that coarse-resolution, freely
available satellite data can reliably steer inspection resources for
conservation-aligned land-use compliance. Code and models have been made
publicly available.

TL;DR: 首次将Vision Mamba作为骨干网络用于三维多孔介质渗透率预测，相比ViT和CNN在计算效率和内存使用上具有优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Mamba相比Vision Transformers具有线性计算复杂度（而非二次方），且比传统CNN需要更少的可训练参数，这使其在计算和内存效率上更具优势。

Method: 使用Vision Mamba作为骨干网络构建神经网络，用于预测三维多孔介质的渗透率，并与ViT和CNN模型进行性能比较，同时进行消融研究评估各组件对准确性的影响。

Result: 在实际应用中验证了Vision Mamba相比ViT和CNN在三维多孔介质渗透率预测中的优势，包括计算效率和内存效率的提升。

Conclusion: 所提出的框架有潜力集成到大型视觉模型中，用Vision Mamba替代ViT，源代码已公开以促进可重复性和进一步研究。

Abstract: Vision Mamba has recently received attention as an alternative to Vision
Transformers (ViTs) for image classification. The network size of Vision Mamba
scales linearly with input image resolution, whereas ViTs scale quadratically,
a feature that improves computational and memory efficiency. Moreover, Vision
Mamba requires a significantly smaller number of trainable parameters than
traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and thus, they can be more
memory efficient. Because of these features, we introduce, for the first time,
a neural network that uses Vision Mamba as its backbone for predicting the
permeability of three-dimensional porous media. We compare the performance of
Vision Mamba with ViT and CNN models across multiple aspects of permeability
prediction and perform an ablation study to assess the effects of its
components on accuracy. We demonstrate in practice the aforementioned
advantages of Vision Mamba over ViTs and CNNs in the permeability prediction of
three-dimensional porous media. We make the source code publicly available to
facilitate reproducibility and to enable other researchers to build on and
extend this work. We believe the proposed framework has the potential to be
integrated into large vision models in which Vision Mamba is used instead of
ViTs.

Result: 实验表明该方法显著提高了不同提示下文本-图像对齐度，推理成本低，无需参考图像或手工先验

Conclusion: 提出的提示感知噪声投影方法有效解决了训练-推理不匹配问题，提升了Stable Diffusion生成图像的质量和对齐度

Abstract: In text-to-image generation, different initial noises induce distinct
denoising paths with a pretrained Stable Diffusion (SD) model. While this
pattern could output diverse images, some of them may fail to align well with
the prompt. Existing methods alleviate this issue either by altering the
denoising dynamics or by drawing multiple noises and conducting post-selection.
In this paper, we attribute the misalignment to a training-inference mismatch:
during training, prompt-conditioned noises lie in a prompt-specific subset of
the latent space, whereas at inference the noise is drawn from a
prompt-agnostic Gaussian prior. To close this gap, we propose a noise projector
that applies text-conditioned refinement to the initial noise before denoising.
Conditioned on the prompt embedding, it maps the noise to a prompt-aware
counterpart that better matches the distribution observed during SD training,
without modifying the SD model. Our framework consists of these steps: we first
sample some noises and obtain token-level feedback for their corresponding
images from a vision-language model (VLM), then distill these signals into a
reward model, and finally optimize the noise projector via a quasi-direct
preference optimization. Our design has two benefits: (i) it requires no
reference images or handcrafted priors, and (ii) it incurs small inference
cost, replacing multi-sample selection with a single forward pass. Extensive
experiments further show that our prompt-aware noise projection improves
text-image alignment across diverse prompts.

Abstract: Oral and maxillofacial radiology plays a vital role in dental healthcare, but
radiographic image interpretation is limited by a shortage of trained
professionals. While AI approaches have shown promise, existing dental AI
systems are restricted by their single-modality focus, task-specific design,
and reliance on costly labeled data, hindering their generalization across
diverse clinical scenarios. To address these challenges, we introduce DentVFM,
the first family of vision foundation models (VFMs) designed for dentistry.
DentVFM generates task-agnostic visual representations for a wide range of
dental applications and uses self-supervised learning on DentVista, a large
curated dental imaging dataset with approximately 1.6 million multi-modal
radiographic images from various medical centers. DentVFM includes 2D and 3D
variants based on the Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture. To address gaps in
dental intelligence assessment and benchmarks, we introduce DentBench, a
comprehensive benchmark covering eight dental subspecialties, more diseases,
imaging modalities, and a wide geographical distribution. DentVFM shows
impressive generalist intelligence, demonstrating robust generalization to
diverse dental tasks, such as disease diagnosis, treatment analysis, biomarker
identification, and anatomical landmark detection and segmentation.
Experimental results indicate DentVFM significantly outperforms supervised,
self-supervised, and weakly supervised baselines, offering superior
generalization, label efficiency, and scalability. Additionally, DentVFM
enables cross-modality diagnostics, providing more reliable results than
experienced dentists in situations where conventional imaging is unavailable.
DentVFM sets a new paradigm for dental AI, offering a scalable, adaptable, and
label-efficient model to improve intelligent dental healthcare and address
critical gaps in global oral healthcare.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像（如MR扫描）存在域偏移问题，影响机器学习性能。现有方法虽然有效但缺乏可解释性，这在医学应用中至关重要。

Method: 使用两个编码器提取域不变和域特定特征，通过对抗训练和图像重建确保协调性和信息完整性，实现伪线性分解。

Conclusion: PL-SE-ADA成功解决了医学图像域协调中的可解释性问题，为临床应用提供了可靠工具。

Abstract: Medical images like MR scans often show domain shifts across imaging sites
due to scanner and protocol differences, which degrade machine learning
performance in tasks such as disease classification. Domain harmonization is
thus a critical research focus. Recent approaches encode brain images
$\boldsymbol{x}$ into a low-dimensional latent space $\boldsymbol{z}$, then
disentangle it into $\boldsymbol{z_u}$ (domain-invariant) and
$\boldsymbol{z_d}$ (domain-specific), achieving strong results. However, these
methods often lack interpretability$-$an essential requirement in medical
applications$-$leaving practical issues unresolved. We propose
Pseudo-Linear-Style Encoder Adversarial Domain Adaptation (PL-SE-ADA), a
general framework for domain harmonization and interpretable representation
learning that preserves disease-relevant information in brain MR images.
PL-SE-ADA includes two encoders $f_E$ and $f_{SE}$ to extract
$\boldsymbol{z_u}$ and $\boldsymbol{z_d}$, a decoder to reconstruct the image
$f_D$, and a domain predictor $g_D$. Beyond adversarial training between the
encoder and domain predictor, the model learns to reconstruct the input image
$\boldsymbol{x}$ by summing reconstructions from $\boldsymbol{z_u}$ and
$\boldsymbol{z_d}$, ensuring both harmonization and informativeness. Compared
to prior methods, PL-SE-ADA achieves equal or better performance in image
reconstruction, disease classification, and domain recognition. It also enables
visualization of both domain-independent brain features and domain-specific
components, offering high interpretability across the entire framework.

Abstract: Exploring and understanding efficient image representations is a
long-standing challenge in computer vision. While deep learning has achieved
remarkable progress across image understanding tasks, its internal
representations are often opaque, making it difficult to interpret how visual
information is processed. In contrast, classical visual descriptors (e.g. edge,
colour, and intensity distribution) have long been fundamental to image
analysis and remain intuitively understandable to humans. Motivated by this
gap, we ask a central question: Can modern learning benefit from these
classical cues? In this paper, we answer it with VisualSplit, a framework that
explicitly decomposes images into decoupled classical descriptors, treating
each as an independent but complementary component of visual knowledge. Through
a reconstruction-driven pre-training scheme, VisualSplit learns to capture the
essence of each visual descriptor while preserving their interpretability. By
explicitly decomposing visual attributes, our method inherently facilitates
effective attribute control in various advanced visual tasks, including image
generation and editing, extending beyond conventional classification and
segmentation, suggesting the effectiveness of this new learning approach for
visual understanding. Project page: https://chenyuanqu.com/VisualSplit/.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的VLA模型缺乏理解和推理3D结构的能力，难以完成精细的操控任务，需要增强空间感知和推理能力。

Method: 设计专门的深度专家模块，预测VQ-VAE编码器获得的深度图的量化潜在token，使模型能够学习捕捉关键几何线索的深度感知表示。

Result: 在仿真基准和真实世界任务上的实验结果表明，QDepth-VLA具有强大的空间推理能力，并在操控任务上表现出竞争力。

Conclusion: 通过深度预测任务增强VLA模型，能够有效提升其空间感知和推理能力，在精细操控任务中取得良好效果。

Abstract: Spatial perception and reasoning are crucial for Vision-Language-Action (VLA)
models to accomplish fine-grained manipulation tasks. However, existing
approaches often lack the ability to understand and reason over the essential
3D structures necessary for precise control. To address this limitation, we
propose QDepth-VLA, a general framework that augments VLA models with an
auxiliary depth prediction task. A dedicated depth expert is designed to
predict quantized latent tokens of depth maps obtained from a VQ-VAE encoder,
enabling the model to learn depth-aware representations that capture critical
geometric cues. Experimental results on the simulation benchmarks and
real-world tasks demonstrate that QDepth-VLA yields strong spatial reasoning
and competitive performance on manipulation tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有参数高效微调(PEFT)方法都是单步调整，对于模态特征高度纠缠的复杂数据集不够充分，需要更精确的多步对齐方法。

Method: 提出FMA方法：1) 使用固定耦合策略确保类别对应；2) 噪声增强策略缓解数据稀缺；3) 早停求解器提高效率和精度。通过跨模态速度场实现多步调整。

Result: 在多个基准测试和骨干网络上，FMA都能带来显著的性能提升，特别是在具有挑战性的数据集上表现突出。

Conclusion: FMA通过多步校正能力实现了更精确和鲁棒的跨模态对齐，相比单步PEFT方法具有明显优势。

Abstract: Aligning features from different modalities, is one of the most fundamental
challenges for cross-modal tasks. Although pre-trained vision-language models
can achieve a general alignment between image and text, they often require
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) for further adjustment. Today's PEFT
methods (e.g., prompt tuning, LoRA-based, or adapter-based) always selectively
fine-tune a subset of parameters, which can slightly adjust either visual or
textual features, and avoid overfitting. In this paper, we are the first to
highlight that all existing PEFT methods perform one-step adjustment. It is
insufficient for complex (or difficult) datasets, where features of different
modalities are highly entangled. To this end, we propose the first
model-agnostic multi-step adjustment approach by learning a cross-modal
velocity field: Flow Matching Alignment (FMA). Specifically, to ensure the
correspondence between categories during training, we first utilize a fixed
coupling strategy. Then, we propose a noise augmentation strategy to alleviate
the data scarcity issue. Finally, we design an early-stopping solver, which
terminates the transformation process earlier, improving both efficiency and
accuracy. Compared with one-step PEFT methods, FMA has the multi-step
rectification ability to achieve more precise and robust alignment. Extensive
results have demonstrated that FMA can consistently yield significant
performance gains across various benchmarks and backbones, particularly on
challenging datasets.

TL;DR: Ponimator是一个基于近距离交互姿态的通用交互动画框架，利用两个条件扩散模型从交互姿态生成动态运动序列或合成交互姿态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近距离人-人交互姿态蕴含丰富的交互动态上下文信息，人类能从中直观推断上下文并预测可能的过去和未来动态。受此启发，作者希望利用交互姿态先验来实现通用交互动画。

Method: 使用两个条件扩散模型：(1)姿态动画器利用时间先验从交互姿态生成动态运动序列；(2)姿态生成器利用空间先验从单姿态、文本或两者合成交互姿态。训练数据来自动捕交互数据集中的近距离双人姿态及其时间上下文。

Result: 实验证明姿态先验的通用性以及框架的有效性和鲁棒性，支持多种任务包括基于图像的交互动画、反应动画和文本到交互合成。

Conclusion: Ponimator能够将高质量动捕数据中的交互知识迁移到开放世界场景，展示了交互姿态先验在通用交互动画中的有效性。

Abstract: Close-proximity human-human interactive poses convey rich contextual
information about interaction dynamics. Given such poses, humans can
intuitively infer the context and anticipate possible past and future dynamics,
drawing on strong priors of human behavior. Inspired by this observation, we
propose Ponimator, a simple framework anchored on proximal interactive poses
for versatile interaction animation. Our training data consists of
close-contact two-person poses and their surrounding temporal context from
motion-capture interaction datasets. Leveraging interactive pose priors,
Ponimator employs two conditional diffusion models: (1) a pose animator that
uses the temporal prior to generate dynamic motion sequences from interactive
poses, and (2) a pose generator that applies the spatial prior to synthesize
interactive poses from a single pose, text, or both when interactive poses are
unavailable. Collectively, Ponimator supports diverse tasks, including
image-based interaction animation, reaction animation, and text-to-interaction
synthesis, facilitating the transfer of interaction knowledge from high-quality
mocap data to open-world scenarios. Empirical experiments across diverse
datasets and applications demonstrate the universality of the pose prior and
the effectiveness and robustness of our framework.

TL;DR: 提出一种训练无关的提示嵌入编辑方法SDeC，通过抑制文本到图像生成中固有的场景-身份相关性，解决身份偏移问题，无需预先知道所有目标场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决文本到图像生成中的身份偏移问题，现有方法通常需要预先知道所有目标场景，这在现实中不切实际。研究发现身份偏移的关键原因是场景上下文化现象。

Method: 提出场景去上下文化(SDeC)方法，通过量化SVD方向稳定性来自适应重新加权特征值，抑制身份提示嵌入中的潜在场景-身份相关性。

Result: 实验证明SDeC显著增强了身份保持能力，同时保持了场景多样性。

Conclusion: SDeC是一种高效、训练无关的解决方案，适用于现实世界应用，无需预先知道所有目标场景。

Abstract: Consistent text-to-image (T2I) generation seeks to produce
identity-preserving images of the same subject across diverse scenes, yet it
often fails due to a phenomenon called identity (ID) shift. Previous methods
have tackled this issue, but typically rely on the unrealistic assumption of
knowing all target scenes in advance. This paper reveals that a key source of
ID shift is the native correlation between subject and scene context, called
scene contextualization, which arises naturally as T2I models fit the training
distribution of vast natural images. We formally prove the near-universality of
this scene-ID correlation and derive theoretical bounds on its strength. On
this basis, we propose a novel, efficient, training-free prompt embedding
editing approach, called Scene De-Contextualization (SDeC), that imposes an
inversion process of T2I's built-in scene contextualization. Specifically, it
identifies and suppresses the latent scene-ID correlation within the ID
prompt's embedding by quantifying the SVD directional stability to adaptively
re-weight the corresponding eigenvalues. Critically, SDeC allows for per-scene
use (one scene per prompt) without requiring prior access to all target scenes.
This makes it a highly flexible and general solution well-suited to real-world
applications where such prior knowledge is often unavailable or varies over
time. Experiments demonstrate that SDeC significantly enhances identity
preservation while maintaining scene diversity.

TL;DR: BalanceGS是一种算法-系统协同设计方法，通过启发式密度控制、相似性采样合并和内存访问重排序，解决了3D高斯溅射训练中的密度分配不均、计算负载不平衡和内存访问碎片化问题，实现了1.44倍的训练加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统3D高斯溅射训练存在三个关键低效问题：高斯密度化过程中的偏斜密度分配、高斯投影中的计算负载不平衡以及颜色溅射中的碎片化内存访问。

Method: 1. 算法层面：提出启发式工作负载敏感的高斯密度控制，自动平衡点分布；2. 系统层面：提出基于相似性的高斯采样和合并，用自适应工作负载分配替代静态线程-像素映射；3. 映射层面：提出基于重排序的内存访问映射策略，重构RGB存储并启用共享内存中的批量加载。

Result: 在NVIDIA A100 GPU上，相比3DGS实现了1.44倍的训练加速，且质量退化可忽略不计。

Conclusion: BalanceGS通过算法-系统协同设计有效解决了3D高斯溅射训练中的效率瓶颈，显著提升了训练性能。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a promising 3D reconstruction
technique. The traditional 3DGS training pipeline follows three sequential
steps: Gaussian densification, Gaussian projection, and color splatting.
Despite its promising reconstruction quality, this conventional approach
suffers from three critical inefficiencies: (1) Skewed density allocation
during Gaussian densification, (2) Imbalanced computation workload during
Gaussian projection and (3) Fragmented memory access during color splatting.
  To tackle the above challenges, we introduce BalanceGS, the algorithm-system
co-design for efficient training in 3DGS. (1) At the algorithm level, we
propose heuristic workload-sensitive Gaussian density control to automatically
balance point distributions - removing 80% redundant Gaussians in dense regions
while filling gaps in sparse areas. (2) At the system level, we propose
Similarity-based Gaussian sampling and merging, which replaces the static
one-to-one thread-pixel mapping with adaptive workload distribution - threads
now dynamically process variable numbers of Gaussians based on local cluster
density. (3) At the mapping level, we propose reordering-based memory access
mapping strategy that restructures RGB storage and enables batch loading in
shared memory.
  Extensive experiments demonstrate that compared with 3DGS, our approach
achieves a 1.44$\times$ training speedup on a NVIDIA A100 GPU with negligible
quality degradation.

Abstract: This paper presents CALM-Net, a curvature-aware LiDAR point cloud-based
multi-branch neural network for vehicle re-identification. The proposed model
addresses the challenge of learning discriminative and complementary features
from three-dimensional point clouds to distinguish between vehicles. CALM-Net
employs a multi-branch architecture that integrates edge convolution, point
attention, and a curvature embedding that characterizes local surface variation
in point clouds. By combining these mechanisms, the model learns richer
geometric and contextual features that are well suited for the
re-identification task. Experimental evaluation on the large-scale nuScenes
dataset demonstrates that CALM-Net achieves a mean re-identification accuracy
improvement of approximately 1.97\% points compared with the strongest baseline
in our study. The results confirms the effectiveness of incorporating curvature
information into deep learning architectures and highlight the benefit of
multi-branch feature learning for LiDAR point cloud-based vehicle
re-identification.

Conclusion: 该双向框架为关键点引导的图像理解和语言引导的精确定位开辟了新的应用前景

Abstract: Vision-language models have achieved remarkable success in cross-modal
understanding. Yet, these models remain limited to object-level or region-level
grounding, lacking the capability for pixel-precise keypoint comprehension
through natural language. We introduce a novel framework for pixel level
grounding. The framework consists of two complementary components: a Point
Descriptor that generates rich, contextual descriptions of individual
keypoints, and a Point Localizer that regresses precise pixel coordinates from
these descriptions. Unlike prior work that relies on templated prompts or
keypoint names, our approach produces free-form, coarse-to-fine descriptions
that situate keypoints within their visual context. Since there is no available
dataset to train such a system, we introduce LlamaPointInPart, a carefully
curated dataset of 20K+ image-keypoint-description triplets synthesized from
multiple vision-language models, capturing multi-scale information from
scene-level context to visual features around the keypoint. For cross-category
generalization, we optimize the Point Descriptor on AP-10K via GRPO, using the
frozen Point Localizer as a reward model to produce descriptions that maximize
localization accuracy. To evaluate our results we establish a new evaluation
protocol. Instead of comparing the text description produced by our method to
the ground truth, we use the localizer to determine how close is the predicted
point generated to the ground truth point. Experiments demonstrate superior
performance compared to baseline models on LlamaPointInPart.The bidirectional
nature of our framework should enable future applications in both
keypoint-guided image understanding and language-guided precise localization.

TL;DR: STANCE是一个图像到视频生成框架，通过实例线索和密集RoPE解决物体运动一致性问题，无需逐帧轨迹脚本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频生成在保持物体运动连贯性和交互方面存在困难，主要瓶颈包括：人类提供的运动提示在编码后有效token过少，以及单一优化头倾向于纹理而非时间一致性。

Method: 引入实例线索（像素对齐的控制信号，将稀疏用户编辑提示转换为密集2.5D运动场）和密集RoPE（在token空间保留线索显著性，使用空间可寻址旋转嵌入标记运动token），结合RGB+辅助图联合预测。

Result: 该方法减少了深度模糊性，稳定了优化过程，提高了时间连贯性。

Conclusion: STANCE框架有效解决了视频生成中的物体运动连贯性问题，通过分离结构和外观处理实现了更好的时间一致性。

Abstract: Video generation has recently made striking visual progress, but maintaining
coherent object motion and interactions remains difficult. We trace two
practical bottlenecks: (i) human-provided motion hints (e.g., small 2D maps)
often collapse to too few effective tokens after encoding, weakening guidance;
and (ii) optimizing for appearance and motion in a single head can favor
texture over temporal consistency. We present STANCE, an image-to-video
framework that addresses both issues with two simple components. First, we
introduce Instance Cues -- a pixel-aligned control signal that turns sparse,
user-editable hints into a dense 2.5D (camera-relative) motion field by
averaging per-instance flow and augmenting with monocular depth over the
instance mask. This reduces depth ambiguity compared to 2D arrow inputs while
remaining easy to use. Second, we preserve the salience of these cues in token
space with Dense RoPE, which tags a small set of motion tokens (anchored on the
first frame) with spatial-addressable rotary embeddings. Paired with joint RGB
\(+\) auxiliary-map prediction (segmentation or depth), our model anchors
structure while RGB handles appearance, stabilizing optimization and improving
temporal coherence without requiring per-frame trajectory scripts.

Conclusion: Wiki-PRF方法通过三阶段处理和强化学习训练，有效提升了KB-VQA任务中的答案质量，证明了多模态信息提取和相关性过滤的重要性。

Abstract: Knowledge-based visual question answering (KB-VQA) requires visual language
models (VLMs) to integrate visual understanding with external knowledge
retrieval. Although retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) achieves significant
advances in this task by combining knowledge-base querying, it still struggles
with the quality of multimodal queries and the relevance of retrieved results.
To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel three-stage method, termed
Wiki-PRF, including Processing, Retrieval and Filtering stages. The processing
stage dynamically invokes visual tools to extract precise multimodal
information for retrieval. The retrieval stage integrates visual and text
features to achieve multimodal knowledge retrieval. The filtering stage
performs relevance filtering and concentration on retrieval results. To this
end, we introduce a visual language model trained with answer accuracy and
format consistency as reward signals via a reinforcement learning manner. This
enhances the model's reasoning, tool invocation for accurate queries, and
filtering of irrelevant content. Experiments on benchmark datasets (E-VQA and
InfoSeek) show significant improvements~(36.0 and 42.8) in answer quality,
achieving state-of-the-art performance. Code is available at

also introduce the Shot2Tactic-Caption Dataset, the first badminton captioning
dataset containing 5,494 shot captions and 544 tactic captions.
Shot2Tactic-Caption adopts a dual-branch design, with both branches including a
visual encoder, a spatio-temporal Transformer encoder, and a Transformer-based
decoder to generate shot and tactic captions. To support tactic captioning, we
additionally introduce a Tactic Unit Detector that identifies valid tactic
units, tactic types, and tactic states (e.g., Interrupt, Resume). For tactic
captioning, we further incorporate a shot-wise prompt-guided mechanism, where
the predicted tactic type and state are embedded as prompts and injected into
the decoder via cross-attention. The shot-wise prompt-guided mechanism enables
our system not only to describe successfully executed tactics but also to
capture tactical executions that are temporarily interrupted and later resumed.
Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in
generating both shot and tactic captions. Ablation studies show that the
ResNet50-based spatio-temporal encoder outperforms other variants, and that
shot-wise prompt structuring leads to more coherent and accurate tactic
captioning.

TL;DR: EVS是一种简单即插即用的视频采样方法，通过识别和修剪时间上静态的补丁来减少视频中的令牌冗余，显著降低令牌数量同时保持语义保真度，实现更快推理和更长输入序列。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型从静态图像理解扩展到视频推理时，处理密集帧序列的二次成本限制了其可扩展性，长视频经常超出现代语言模型的令牌预算，导致严重的上下文限制和延迟问题。

Method: 引入高效视频采样(EVS)，通过识别和修剪时间上静态的补丁（在连续帧中保持不变的空间区域）来减少视频中的令牌冗余，该方法保持位置身份，无需架构更改或重新训练。

Result: EVS在推理时应用，将大型语言模型的首令牌时间(TTFT)减少高达4倍，且精度损失最小。结合使用随机修剪率的上训练阶段，EVS产生对变化压缩级别具有鲁棒性的模型，并在激进修剪下保持完整性能。

Conclusion: 广泛实验表明，EVS持续改善效率-精度权衡，在不牺牲质量的情况下解锁可扩展的视频语言理解。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have recently expanded from static image
understanding to video reasoning, but their scalability is fundamentally
limited by the quadratic cost of processing dense frame sequences. Long videos
often exceed the token budget of modern language models, leading to severe
context limitations and latency issues. We introduce Efficient Video Sampling
(EVS), a simple, plug-and-play method for reducing token redundancy in videos
by identifying and pruning temporally static patches -- spatial regions that
remain unchanged across consecutive frames. EVS preserves positional identity,
requires no architectural changes or retraining. We show that EVS substantially
reduces token count while maintaining semantic fidelity, enabling faster
inference and longer input sequences. Applied at inference time, EVS reduces
large language model (LLM) time-to-first-token (TTFT) by up to 4x with minimal
accuracy loss. When combined with an uptraining phase using stochastic pruning
rates, EVS yields models that are robust to varying compression levels and
retain full performance under aggressive pruning. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that EVS consistently improves efficiency-accuracy trade-offs,
unlocking scalable video-language understanding without sacrificing quality.

TL;DR: RepTok是一个生成建模框架，使用自监督视觉变换器的单个连续潜在token表示图像，通过微调语义token嵌入和生成解码器实现高效图像生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决2D潜在空间的空间冗余问题，显著降低训练成本，同时保持生成质量。

Method: 基于预训练SSL编码器，仅微调语义token嵌入，配合使用流匹配目标的生成解码器，添加余弦相似度损失保持潜在空间几何特性。

Result: 在类别条件ImageNet生成上取得竞争性结果，在MS-COCO上实现零样本文本到图像合成，在极有限训练预算下达到竞争性能。

Conclusion: 微调的自监督表示可以作为紧凑有效的潜在空间，用于高效生成建模。

Abstract: We introduce Representation Tokenizer (RepTok), a generative modeling
framework that represents an image using a single continuous latent token
obtained from self-supervised vision transformers. Building on a pre-trained
SSL encoder, we fine-tune only the semantic token embedding and pair it with a
generative decoder trained jointly using a standard flow matching objective.
This adaptation enriches the token with low-level, reconstruction-relevant
details, enabling faithful image reconstruction. To preserve the favorable
geometry of the original SSL space, we add a cosine-similarity loss that
regularizes the adapted token, ensuring the latent space remains smooth and
suitable for generation. Our single-token formulation resolves spatial
redundancies of 2D latent spaces and significantly reduces training costs.
Despite its simplicity and efficiency, RepTok achieves competitive results on
class-conditional ImageNet generation and naturally extends to text-to-image
synthesis, reaching competitive zero-shot performance on MS-COCO under
extremely limited training budgets. Our findings highlight the potential of
fine-tuned SSL representations as compact and effective latent spaces for
efficient generative modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有基于扩散的测试时适应方法依赖梯度引导、探索能力有限且在不同失真类型上泛化能力不足的问题。

Method: 采用Feynman-Kac引导机制，维护多个粒子轨迹，通过累积top-K概率和熵调度来平衡探索与置信度，使用伪标签驱动的奖励进行扩散输入适应。

Result: 在ImageNet-C数据集上，SteeringTTA始终优于基线方法，无需任何模型更新或源数据。

Conclusion: SteeringTTA框架有效提升了测试时适应的性能，通过引导机制实现了更好的探索与泛化能力。

Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) aims to correct performance degradation of deep
models under distribution shifts by updating models or inputs using unlabeled
test data. Input-only diffusion-based TTA methods improve robustness for
classification to corruptions but rely on gradient guidance, limiting
exploration and generalization across distortion types. We propose SteeringTTA,
an inference-only framework that adapts Feynman-Kac steering to guide
diffusion-based input adaptation for classification with rewards driven by
pseudo-label. SteeringTTA maintains multiple particle trajectories, steered by
a combination of cumulative top-K probabilities and an entropy schedule, to
balance exploration and confidence. On ImageNet-C, SteeringTTA consistently
outperforms the baseline without any model updates or source data.

TL;DR: 提出了一种低成本预训练策略，通过上下文学习从未配对视频片段中学习视频编辑能力，显著提升了指令视频编辑的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 指令式图像编辑发展迅速，但扩展到视频领域面临挑战，主要因为构建大规模配对视频编辑数据集成本高昂且复杂。

Method: 采用基于上下文学习的低成本预训练策略，首先在约100万个真实视频片段上预训练学习基本编辑概念，然后在少于15万个精选编辑对上微调以扩展编辑任务和提升质量。

Result: 在指令对齐和视觉保真度方面均优于现有方法，编辑指令遵循能力提升12%，编辑质量提升15%。

Conclusion: 该策略能够有效赋予基础视频生成模型通用编辑能力，并通过少量高质量配对数据高效精炼，显著推进了指令式视频编辑的发展。

Abstract: Despite the rapid progress of instruction-based image editing, its extension
to video remains underexplored, primarily due to the prohibitive cost and
complexity of constructing large-scale paired video editing datasets. To
address this challenge, we introduce a low-cost pretraining strategy for
instruction-based video editing that leverages in-context learning from
unpaired video clips. We show that pretraining a foundation video generation
model with this strategy endows it with general editing capabilities, such as
adding, replacing, or deleting operations, according to input editing
instructions. The pretrained model can then be efficiently refined with a small
amount of high-quality paired editing data. Built upon HunyuanVideoT2V, our
framework first pretrains on approximately 1M real video clips to learn basic
editing concepts, and subsequently fine-tunes on fewer than 150k curated
editing pairs to extend more editing tasks and improve the editing quality.
Comparative experiments show that our method surpasses existing
instruction-based video editing approaches in both instruction alignment and
visual fidelity, achieving a 12\% improvement in editing instruction following
and a 15\% improvement in editing quality.

TL;DR: 将去相关反向传播(DBP)集成到MAE预训练中，通过减少输入相关性来加速收敛，在保持性能的同时显著降低训练时间和碳排放


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MAE预训练虽然性能优异但计算成本高昂，在工业环境中不实用，需要更高效的训练方法

Method: 在MAE预训练的编码器中选择性应用DBP优化方法，迭代减少各层的输入相关性以加速收敛

Result: DBP-MAE将训练时间减少21.1%，碳排放降低21.4%，分割mIoU提高1.1个百分点，在工业数据上也有类似提升

Conclusion: DBP能够在大规模ViT预训练中减少训练时间和能耗，同时提升下游任务性能

Abstract: Masked Autoencoder (MAE) pre-training of vision transformers (ViTs) yields
strong performance in low-label regimes but comes with substantial
computational costs, making it impractical in time- and resource-constrained
industrial settings. We address this by integrating Decorrelated
Backpropagation (DBP) into MAE pre-training, an optimization method that
iteratively reduces input correlations at each layer to accelerate convergence.
Applied selectively to the encoder, DBP achieves faster pre-training without
loss of stability. On ImageNet-1K pre-training with ADE20K fine-tuning, DBP-MAE
reduces wall-clock time to baseline performance by 21.1%, lowers carbon
emissions by 21.4% and improves segmentation mIoU by 1.1 points. We observe
similar gains when pre-training and fine-tuning on proprietary industrial data,
confirming the method's applicability in real-world scenarios. These results
demonstrate that DBP can reduce training time and energy use while improving
downstream performance for large-scale ViT pre-training.

TL;DR: EuroMineNet是首个基于Sentinel-2多光谱影像的采矿足迹制图与监测多时相基准数据集，涵盖欧盟133个采矿点2015-2024年的年度观测和专家验证标注，支持GeoAI模型分析环境动态。


<details>

Motivation: 采矿活动是环境退化的主要来源，但现有数据集在时间深度和地理范围上有限，需要长期一致的监测来支持可持续资源管理和环境治理。

Method: 创建EuroMineNet数据集，包含133个欧盟采矿点的年度观测和专家验证标注，支持两个任务：多时相采矿足迹制图和跨时相变化检测，使用新颖的Change-Aware Temporal IoU (CA-TIoU)指标评估。

Result: 对20个最先进的深度学习模型进行基准测试，显示GeoAI方法能有效识别长期环境变化，但在检测短期动态方面仍面临挑战。

Conclusion: EuroMineNet通过推进时间一致且可解释的采矿监测，有助于可持续土地利用管理、环境韧性，以及将GeoAI应用于社会和环境的更广泛目标。

Abstract: Mining activities are essential for industrial and economic development, but
remain a leading source of environmental degradation, contributing to
deforestation, soil erosion, and water contamination. Sustainable resource
management and environmental governance require consistent, long-term
monitoring of mining-induced land surface changes, yet existing datasets are
often limited in temporal depth or geographic scope. To address this gap, we
present EuroMineNet, the first comprehensive multitemporal benchmark for mining
footprint mapping and monitoring based on Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery.
Spanning 133 mining sites across the European Union, EuroMineNet provides
annual observations and expert-verified annotations from 2015 to 2024, enabling
GeoAI-based models to analyze environmental dynamics at a continental scale. It
supports two sustainability-driven tasks: (1) multitemporal mining footprint
mapping for consistent annual land-use delineation, evaluated with a novel
Change-Aware Temporal IoU (CA-TIoU) metric, and (2) cross-temporal change
detection to capture both gradual and abrupt surface transformations.
Benchmarking 20 state-of-the-art deep learning models reveals that while GeoAI
methods effectively identify long-term environmental changes, challenges remain
in detecting short-term dynamics critical for timely mitigation. By advancing
temporally consistent and explainable mining monitoring, EuroMineNet
contributes to sustainable land-use management, environmental resilience, and
the broader goal of applying GeoAI for social and environmental good. We
release the codes and datasets by aligning with FAIR and the open science
paradigm at https://github.com/EricYu97/EuroMineNet.

TL;DR: 提出了WeCKD方法，通过构建渐进式蒸馏链来改进传统知识蒸馏，每个模型不仅从前驱学习知识，还进行知识精炼后传递给后续模型，显著减少了数据依赖并提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统知识蒸馏方法存在知识退化、监督效率低、依赖强教师模型或大数据集等问题，限制了在真实世界有限数据场景下的有效性。

Method: 采用弱监督链式知识蒸馏网络，构建渐进式蒸馏链，每个模型仅使用部分数据集进行训练，通过结构化知识传递增强特征学习。

Result: 在四个耳镜成像数据集上的评估显示，该方法不仅匹配而且经常超越现有监督方法的性能，在其他两个数据集上也表现出良好的泛化能力，累积准确率提升最高达+23%。

Conclusion: WeCKD方法通过链式知识蒸馏有效解决了传统KD的局限性，在有限数据场景下表现出色，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) has traditionally relied on a static
teacher-student framework, where a large, well-trained teacher transfers
knowledge to a single student model. However, these approaches often suffer
from knowledge degradation, inefficient supervision, and reliance on either a
very strong teacher model or large labeled datasets, which limits their
effectiveness in real-world, limited-data scenarios. To address these, we
present the first-ever Weakly-supervised Chain-based KD network (WeCKD) that
redefines knowledge transfer through a structured sequence of interconnected
models. Unlike conventional KD, it forms a progressive distillation chain,
where each model not only learns from its predecessor but also refines the
knowledge before passing it forward. This structured knowledge transfer further
enhances feature learning, reduces data dependency, and mitigates the
limitations of one-step KD. Each model in the distillation chain is trained on
only a fraction of the dataset and demonstrates that effective learning can be
achieved with minimal supervision. Extensive evaluations across four otoscopic
imaging datasets demonstrate that it not only matches but in many cases
surpasses the performance of existing supervised methods. Experimental results
on two other datasets further underscore its generalization across diverse
medical imaging modalities, including microscopic and magnetic resonance
imaging. Furthermore, our evaluations resulted in cumulative accuracy gains of
up to +23% over a single backbone trained on the same limited data, which
highlights its potential for real-world adoption.

Result: 在视频时间定位和基于推理的问答任务中，该方法在Qwen2VL-7B和GPT4o基准上取得了显著的性能提升。

Conclusion: 该框架实现了组合性和可解释的推理过程，为视频理解系统提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: In recent years, video question answering based on multimodal large language
models (MLLM) has garnered considerable attention, due to the benefits from the
substantial advancements in LLMs. However, these models have a notable
deficiency in the domains of video temporal grounding and reasoning, posing
challenges to the development of effective real-world video understanding
systems. Inspired by how humans use video players to interact with the progress
bar for video comprehension, we introduce VTimeCoT, a simple yet effective
training-free framework, designed for high-performance video grounding and
reasoning. The proposed framework incorporates two novel visual tools of the
progress bar: a plug-and-play progress bar integration tool and a
high-efficiency highlighting tool. In addition, to address the limitations of
conventional text-based chain-of-thought (CoT) approaches, we introduce a
visuotemporal CoT process that integrates cross-modality reasoning across both
video and text. Our approach demonstrates significant performance improvements
on both Qwen2VL-7B and GPT4o baselines in tasks of video temporal grounding and
reasoning-based question answering. Finally, we showcase that the proposed
framework achieves a compositional and interpretable reasoning process. Project

Method: 在初始压缩高斯基础上，构建恢复网络建模图像空间压缩伪影，引入粗渲染残差作为辅助信息，通过恢复图像监督优化压缩高斯。

Result: 实验验证了框架有效性，在显著减少存储需求的同时，超越了最先进3DGS压缩方法的渲染质量。

Conclusion: 该框架兼容现有高斯压缩方法，实现了优越的率失真性能和增强的渲染质量。

Abstract: Compression techniques for 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have recently
achieved considerable success in minimizing storage overhead for 3D Gaussians
while preserving high rendering quality. Despite the impressive storage
reduction, the lack of learned priors restricts further advances in the
rate-distortion trade-off for 3DGS compression tasks. To address this, we
introduce a novel 3DGS compression framework that leverages the powerful
representational capacity of learned image priors to recover
compression-induced quality degradation. Built upon initially compressed
Gaussians, our restoration network effectively models the compression artifacts
in the image space between degraded and original Gaussians. To enhance the
rate-distortion performance, we provide coarse rendering residuals into the
restoration network as side information. By leveraging the supervision of
restored images, the compressed Gaussians are refined, resulting in a highly
compact representation with enhanced rendering performance. Our framework is
designed to be compatible with existing Gaussian compression methods, making it
broadly applicable across different baselines. Extensive experiments validate
the effectiveness of our framework, demonstrating superior rate-distortion
performance and outperforming the rendering quality of state-of-the-art 3DGS
compression methods while requiring substantially less storage.

Abstract: Effective monitoring of whale populations is critical for conservation, but
traditional survey methods are expensive and difficult to scale. While prior
work has shown that whales can be identified in very high-resolution (VHR)
satellite imagery, large-scale automated detection remains challenging due to a
lack of annotated imagery, variability in image quality and environmental
conditions, and the cost of building robust machine learning pipelines over
massive remote sensing archives. We present a semi-automated approach for
surfacing possible whale detections in VHR imagery using a statistical anomaly
detection method that flags spatial outliers, i.e. "interesting points". We
pair this detector with a web-based labeling interface designed to enable
experts to quickly annotate the interesting points. We evaluate our system on
three benchmark scenes with known whale annotations and achieve recalls of
90.3% to 96.4%, while reducing the area requiring expert inspection by up to
99.8% -- from over 1,000 sq km to less than 2 sq km in some cases. Our method
does not rely on labeled training data and offers a scalable first step toward
future machine-assisted marine mammal monitoring from space. We have open

Motivation: 现有注意力方法局限于单层或双层特征优化，忽略了多尺度表征间的跨层依赖关系，难以处理尺度变化大的目标检测

Method: CFSAM包含三个组件：卷积局部特征提取器、基于Transformer的全局建模单元（捕获跨层交互）、特征融合机制

Result: 在SSD300框架中集成CFSAM，PASCAL VOC达到78.6% mAP（基线75.5%），COCO达到52.1% mAP（基线43.1%），优于现有注意力模块

Conclusion: 显式的跨层注意力建模对推进多尺度目标检测至关重要，CFSAM能显著提升性能且加速收敛，计算开销小

Abstract: Recent object detection methods have made remarkable progress by leveraging
attention mechanisms to improve feature discriminability. However, most
existing approaches are confined to refining single-layer or fusing dual-layer
features, overlooking the rich inter-layer dependencies across multi-scale
representations. This limits their ability to capture comprehensive contextual
information essential for detecting objects with large scale variations. In
this paper, we propose a novel Cross-Layer Feature Self-Attention Module
(CFSAM), which holistically models both local and global dependencies within
multi-scale feature maps. CFSAM consists of three key components: a
convolutional local feature extractor, a Transformer-based global modeling unit
that efficiently captures cross-layer interactions, and a feature fusion
mechanism to restore and enhance the original representations. When integrated
into the SSD300 framework, CFSAM significantly boosts detection performance,
achieving 78.6% mAP on PASCAL VOC (vs. 75.5% baseline) and 52.1% mAP on COCO
(vs. 43.1% baseline), outperforming existing attention modules. Moreover, the
module accelerates convergence during training without introducing substantial
computational overhead. Our work highlights the importance of explicit
cross-layer attention modeling in advancing multi-scale object detection.

Motivation: 现有分层图像分类方法通常假设完整的细粒度标注，但现实世界中的监督标注粒度各不相同，受图像质量、标注者专业知识和任务需求的影响。

Method: 使用CLIP作为语义模糊性的代理，模拟现实的混合粒度标注；提出free-grain学习方法，通过视觉语言模型生成伪属性和半监督学习来增强语义和视觉指导。

Result: 提出的方法和强基线在混合监督下显著提高了性能。

Conclusion: ImageNet-F基准测试和相关方法推动了在现实约束条件下的分层分类研究进展。

Abstract: Hierarchical image classification predicts labels across a semantic taxonomy,
but existing methods typically assume complete, fine-grained annotations, an
assumption rarely met in practice. Real-world supervision varies in
granularity, influenced by image quality, annotator expertise, and task
demands; a distant bird may be labeled Bird, while a close-up reveals Bald
eagle. We introduce ImageNet-F, a large-scale benchmark curated from ImageNet
and structured into cognitively inspired basic, subordinate, and fine-grained
levels. Using CLIP as a proxy for semantic ambiguity, we simulate realistic,
mixed-granularity labels reflecting human annotation behavior. We propose
free-grain learning, with heterogeneous supervision across instances. We
develop methods that enhance semantic guidance via pseudo-attributes from
vision-language models and visual guidance via semi-supervised learning. These,
along with strong baselines, substantially improve performance under mixed
supervision. Together, our benchmark and methods advance hierarchical
classification under real-world constraints.

DEXTER, a data-free framework that employs diffusion models and large language
models to generate global, textual explanations of visual classifiers. DEXTER
operates by optimizing text prompts to synthesize class-conditional images that
strongly activate a target classifier. These synthetic samples are then used to
elicit detailed natural language reports that describe class-specific decision
patterns and biases. Unlike prior work, DEXTER enables natural language
explanation about a classifier's decision process without access to training
data or ground-truth labels. We demonstrate DEXTER's flexibility across three
tasks-activation maximization, slice discovery and debiasing, and bias
explanation-each illustrating its ability to uncover the internal mechanisms of
visual classifiers. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations, including a user
study, show that DEXTER produces accurate, interpretable outputs. Experiments
on ImageNet, Waterbirds, CelebA, and FairFaces confirm that DEXTER outperforms
existing approaches in global model explanation and class-level bias reporting.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了LightQANet框架，通过量化自适应特征学习解决低光图像增强问题，包含光照量化模块和光照感知提示模块，在多个数据集上取得SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有低光图像增强方法由于像素级信息严重退化，难以提取可靠特征表示，导致纹理恢复差、颜色不一致和伪影问题。

Method: 设计光照量化模块(LQM)显式提取和量化光照相关因子，增强光照不变表示；引入光照感知提示模块(LAPM)将光照先验编码为可学习提示，动态指导特征学习过程。

Result: 在多个低光数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法在各种挑战性光照场景下均取得优异的定性和定量结果，达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: LightQANet通过量化自适应特征学习能够实现跨不同光照条件的一致且鲁棒的图像质量增强。

Abstract: Low-light image enhancement (LLIE) aims to improve illumination while
preserving high-quality color and texture. However, existing methods often fail
to extract reliable feature representations due to severely degraded
pixel-level information under low-light conditions, resulting in poor texture
restoration, color inconsistency, and artifact. To address these challenges, we
propose LightQANet, a novel framework that introduces quantized and adaptive
feature learning for low-light enhancement, aiming to achieve consistent and
robust image quality across diverse lighting conditions. From the static
modeling perspective, we design a Light Quantization Module (LQM) to explicitly
extract and quantify illumination-related factors from image features. By
enforcing structured light factor learning, LQM enhances the extraction of
light-invariant representations and mitigates feature inconsistency across
varying illumination levels. From the dynamic adaptation perspective, we
introduce a Light-Aware Prompt Module (LAPM), which encodes illumination priors
into learnable prompts to dynamically guide the feature learning process. LAPM
enables the model to flexibly adapt to complex and continuously changing
lighting conditions, further improving image enhancement. Extensive experiments
on multiple low-light datasets demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance, delivering superior qualitative and quantitative
results across various challenging lighting scenarios.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于无条件扩散模型的方法来重建火星表面地形，填补卫星高度图中的缺失值，相比传统方法在重建精度和感知相似度方面表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 火星地形数据中存在大量缺失值，传统插值方法难以保持几何一致性，而地球上的条件方法无法应用于火星，因此需要开发专门的无条件深度学习方法。

Method: 使用无条件扩散模型，在12000个火星高度图增强数据集上训练，采用非均匀缩放策略捕捉多尺度地形特征，最终固定为128x128分辨率。

Result: 在1000个评估样本上，该方法在重建精度（RMSE提升4-15%）和感知相似度（LPIPS提升29-81%）方面均优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 无条件扩散模型能够有效重建火星表面地形，填补缺失值，为太空探索中的虚拟现实应用提供更可靠的地形数据。

Abstract: Space exploration increasingly relies on Virtual Reality for several tasks,
such as mission planning, multidisciplinary scientific analysis, and astronaut
training. A key factor for the reliability of the simulations is having
accurate 3D representations of planetary terrains. Extraterrestrial heightmaps
derived from satellite imagery often contain missing values due to acquisition
and transmission constraints. Mars is among the most studied planets beyond
Earth, and its extensive terrain datasets make the Martian surface
reconstruction a valuable task, although many areas remain unmapped. Deep
learning algorithms can support void-filling tasks; however, whereas Earth's
comprehensive datasets enables the use of conditional methods, such approaches
cannot be applied to Mars. Current approaches rely on simpler interpolation
techniques which, however, often fail to preserve geometric coherence. In this
work, we propose a method for reconstructing the surface of Mars based on an
unconditional diffusion model. Training was conducted on an augmented dataset
of 12000 Martian heightmaps derived from NASA's HiRISE survey. A
non-homogeneous rescaling strategy captures terrain features across multiple
scales before resizing to a fixed 128x128 model resolution. We compared our
method against established void-filling and inpainting techniques, including
Inverse Distance Weighting, kriging, and Navier-Stokes algorithm, on an
evaluation set of 1000 samples. Results show that our approach consistently
outperforms these methods in terms of reconstruction accuracy (4-15% on RMSE)
and perceptual similarity (29-81% on LPIPS) with the original data.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于视觉运动信号的微型飞行器集群通信框架，模仿蜜蜂摇摆舞，使用四种基本运动模式传递信息，通过事件相机和脉冲神经网络实现低功耗解码。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统无线电通信在MAV集群中存在频谱拥塞、干扰和高功耗问题，需要寻找更可靠的替代通信方式。

Method: 使用四种运动基元（上下、左右、左-上-右、左-下-右）作为控制符号，通过事件相机捕获MAV运动模式，设计基于事件帧的分割模型和轻量级SNN进行动作识别和解码。

Result: 实验验证了该框架的有效性，实现了准确解码和低功耗，在受限环境中表现出良好性能。

Conclusion: 该视觉通信框架为MAV集群提供了一种节能高效的替代通信方案，特别适用于受约束环境。

Abstract: Reliable communication in Micro Air Vehicle (MAV) swarms is challenging in
environments, where conventional radio-based methods suffer from spectrum
congestion, jamming, and high power consumption. Inspired by the waggle dance
of honeybees, which efficiently communicate the location of food sources
without sound or contact, we propose a novel visual communication framework for
MAV swarms using motion-based signaling. In this framework, MAVs convey
information, such as heading and distance, through deliberate flight patterns,
which are passively captured by event cameras and interpreted using a
predefined visual codebook of four motion primitives: vertical (up/down),
horizontal (left/right), left-to-up-to-right, and left-to-down-to-right,
representing control symbols (``start'', ``end'', ``1'', ``0''). To decode
these signals, we design an event frame-based segmentation model and a
lightweight Spiking Neural Network (SNN) for action recognition. An integrated
decoding algorithm then combines segmentation and classification to robustly
interpret MAV motion sequences. Experimental results validate the framework's
effectiveness, which demonstrates accurate decoding and low power consumption,
and highlights its potential as an energy-efficient alternative for MAV
communication in constrained environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoT-PL是一个用于开放词汇目标检测的新框架，通过引入视觉链式思维推理来改进伪标签生成过程，在拥挤或遮挡场景中显著提升新类别的检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的开放词汇目标检测方法主要依赖直接的图像-文本匹配，忽略了理解语义复杂场景所需的中间推理步骤，导致在拥挤或遮挡场景中鲁棒性不足。

Method: CoT-PL将目标理解分解为三个可解释步骤：区域感知、零样本类别识别和背景定位，并引入对比背景学习来促进目标与背景的特征解耦。

Result: 在拥挤和遮挡场景中，新类别伪标签质量分别相对提升了103.4%和168.4%；在开放词汇COCO数据集上AP50提升了7.7，在LVIS数据集上新类别mask AP提升了2.9。

Conclusion: CoT-PL通过结构化视觉链式思维推理和对比背景学习，显著提升了开放词汇目标检测在复杂场景中的性能，达到了新的最先进水平。

Abstract: Open-vocabulary object detection (OVD) seeks to recognize and localize object
categories beyond those seen during training. Recent approaches typically
leverage vision-language models (VLMs) to generate pseudo-labels using
image-text alignment, allowing detectors to generalize to unseen classes
without explicit supervision. However, these methods depend heavily on direct
image-text matching, neglecting the intermediate reasoning steps essential for
interpreting semantically complex scenes. This results in limited robustness
when confronted with crowded or occluded visual contexts. In this paper, we
introduce CoT-PL, a new framework that employs structured visual
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning into the pseudo-labeling process. CoT-PL
decomposes object understanding into three interpretable steps: (1) region
perception even for unseen objects, (2) category recognition via zero-shot
reasoning, and (3) background grounding to separate semantically complex
objects. Crucially, the third step naturally motivates our contrastive
background learning (CBL) that uses the pre-computed background cues as
negatives to promote feature disentanglement between objects and background. In
this way, CoT reasoning and CBL form an integrated pipeline tailored to robust
pseudo-labeling in crowded or occluded scenes. Notably, in these two settings,
our novel-class pseudo-label quality achieves relative improvements of 103.4%
and 168.4% over the best prior, respectively. Our extensive experiments
demonstrate that CoT-PL achieves +7.7 AP50 on open-vocabulary COCO and +2.9
mask AP on LVIS for novel classes, setting a new state of the art.

TL;DR: 开发了PRISM模型，一种可解释的AI模型，通过整合连续变异谱来表征结直肠癌的形态多样性，在5年总生存期预测上表现优异，超越现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基础模型在计算病理学中往往忽视器官特异性关键形态模式，这些模式代表不同的生物过程，能从根本上影响肿瘤行为、治疗反应和患者预后。

Method: PRISM模型整合了连续变异谱来表征形态多样性，基于424名III期结直肠癌患者的874万张组织学图像进行训练，反映了恶性转化通过渐进进化过程而非突然表型转变的原则。

Result: PRISM在5年总生存期预测上表现优异（AUC=0.70±0.04；准确率=68.37%±4.75%；HR=3.34），比现有CRC特异性方法高15%，比AI基础模型高约23%准确率。模型具有性别无关的稳健性和跨临床病理亚组的稳定性能。

Conclusion: PRISM模型成功捕捉了结直肠癌的形态多样性，提供了优越的预后预测能力，且具有稳健的跨组性能，验证了治疗组间无生存差异的发现。

Abstract: Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains the third most prevalent malignancy globally,
with approximately 154,000 new cases and 54,000 projected deaths anticipated
for 2025. The recent advancement of foundation models in computational
pathology has been largely propelled by task agnostic methodologies that can
overlook organ-specific crucial morphological patterns that represent distinct
biological processes that can fundamentally influence tumor behavior,
therapeutic response, and patient outcomes. The aim of this study is to develop
a novel, interpretable AI model, PRISM (Prognostic Representation of Integrated
Spatial Morphology), that incorporates a continuous variability spectrum within
each distinct morphology to characterize phenotypic diversity and reflecting
the principle that malignant transformation occurs through incremental
evolutionary processes rather than abrupt phenotypic shifts. PRISM is trained
on 8.74 million histological images extracted from surgical resection specimens
of 424 patients with stage III CRC. PRISM achieved superior prognostic
performance for five-year OS (AUC = 0.70 +- 0.04; accuracy = 68.37% +- 4.75%;
HR = 3.34, 95% CI = 2.28-4.90; p < 0.0001), outperforming existing CRC-specific
methods by 15% and AI foundation models by ~23% accuracy. It showed
sex-agnostic robustness (AUC delta = 0.02; accuracy delta = 0.15%) and stable
performance across clinicopathological subgroups, with minimal accuracy
fluctuation (delta = 1.44%) between 5FU/LV and CPT-11/5FU/LV regimens,
replicating the Alliance cohort finding of no survival difference between
treatments.

TL;DR: R-Super是一种利用医学报告训练AI进行肿瘤分割的方法，大幅减少了对人工绘制肿瘤掩码的需求，在多种肿瘤类型上实现了与使用大量掩码训练相当甚至更好的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 早期肿瘤检测能挽救生命，但CT扫描中的小肿瘤检测困难。传统AI训练需要大量人工绘制的肿瘤掩码，成本高昂且耗时。而临床实践中已有丰富的医学报告描述肿瘤特征，这些信息未被充分利用。

Method: R-Super通过训练AI模型来分割与医学报告中描述相匹配的肿瘤，利用大量现成的医学报告进行训练，显著减少对人工绘制肿瘤掩码的依赖。

Result: 使用101,654份报告训练的AI模型性能与使用723个掩码训练的模型相当。结合报告和掩码训练，灵敏度提升13%，特异性提升8%，在7种肿瘤类型中有5种检测性能超过放射科医生。

Conclusion: 该研究挑战了大规模人工绘制肿瘤掩码不可或缺的传统观念，为多种肿瘤类型的早期检测建立了可扩展且易于实现的路径。

Abstract: Early tumor detection save lives. Each year, more than 300 million computed
tomography (CT) scans are performed worldwide, offering a vast opportunity for
effective cancer screening. However, detecting small or early-stage tumors on
these CT scans remains challenging, even for experts. Artificial intelligence
(AI) models can assist by highlighting suspicious regions, but training such
models typically requires extensive tumor masks--detailed, voxel-wise outlines
of tumors manually drawn by radiologists. Drawing these masks is costly,
requiring years of effort and millions of dollars. In contrast, nearly every CT
scan in clinical practice is already accompanied by medical reports describing
the tumor's size, number, appearance, and sometimes, pathology
results--information that is rich, abundant, and often underutilized for AI
training. We introduce R-Super, which trains AI to segment tumors that match
their descriptions in medical reports. This approach scales AI training with
large collections of readily available medical reports, substantially reducing
the need for manually drawn tumor masks. When trained on 101,654 reports, AI
models achieved performance comparable to those trained on 723 masks. Combining
reports and masks further improved sensitivity by +13% and specificity by +8%,
surpassing radiologists in detecting five of the seven tumor types. Notably,
R-Super enabled segmentation of tumors in the spleen, gallbladder, prostate,
bladder, uterus, and esophagus, for which no public masks or AI models
previously existed. This study challenges the long-held belief that
large-scale, labor-intensive tumor mask creation is indispensable, establishing
a scalable and accessible path toward early detection across diverse tumor
types.

TL;DR: PRTraj是一个新的轨迹表示学习框架，通过环境感知和路径选择建模来改进轨迹嵌入，在多个下游任务中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有轨迹表示学习方法将轨迹视为孤立的时空序列，忽略了外部环境和内部路径选择行为对其形成的影响。

Method: PRTraj包含环境感知模块捕获多粒度环境语义，以及路径选择编码器建模道路段转换决策序列，最终聚合形成全局轨迹嵌入。

Result: 在3个真实世界数据集和5个下游任务上的广泛实验验证了PRTraj的有效性和泛化能力，在少样本场景下也保持稳健性能。

Conclusion: PRTraj通过统一环境感知和路径选择建模，显著提升了轨迹表示学习的性能，具有很好的数据效率和泛化能力。

Abstract: Trajectory Representation Learning (TRL) aims to encode raw trajectories into
low-dimensional vectors, which can then be leveraged in various downstream
tasks, including travel time estimation, location prediction, and trajectory
similarity analysis. However, existing TRL methods suffer from a key oversight:
treating trajectories as isolated spatio-temporal sequences, without
considering the external environment and internal route choice behavior that
govern their formation. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel framework that
unifies comprehensive environment \textbf{P}erception and explicit
\textbf{R}oute choice modeling for effective \textbf{Traj}ectory representation
learning, dubbed \textbf{PRTraj}. Specifically, PRTraj first introduces an
Environment Perception Module to enhance the road network by capturing
multi-granularity environmental semantics from surrounding POI distributions.
Building on this environment-aware backbone, a Route Choice Encoder then
captures the route choice behavior inherent in each trajectory by modeling its
constituent road segment transitions as a sequence of decisions. These
route-choice-aware representations are finally aggregated to form the global
trajectory embedding. Extensive experiments on 3 real-world datasets across 5
downstream tasks validate the effectiveness and generalizability of PRTraj.
Moreover, PRTraj demonstrates strong data efficiency, maintaining robust
performance under few-shot scenarios. Our code is available at:

Motivation: 解决大容量生成模型无法在智能手机上部署的问题，因为手机内存和计算资源有限。虽然量化方法可以降低模型参数精度实现高效计算，但激进量化会损害模型质量。

Method: 提出分数位量化(SHORT)方法，渐进式降低模型精度从32位到4位，在优化过程中利用分数位来维持高生成质量。

Result: 在多种扩散模型(SD3.5-Medium、Sana、Pixart、FLUX.1-schnell)上实现了比标准QAT低4-7%的FiD分数，表明生成质量更好。成功在三星S25U手机上部署Sana模型。

Conclusion: SHORT方法能够有效平衡模型量化后的效率与质量，使大容量生成模型能够在资源受限的移动设备上部署运行。

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) generative models have demonstrated impressive
capabilities in image synthesis or text generation, often with a large capacity
model. However, these large models cannot be deployed on smartphones due to the
limited availability of on-board memory and computations. Quantization methods
lower the precision of the model parameters, allowing for efficient
computations, \eg, in \INT{8}. Although aggressive quantization addresses
efficiency and memory constraints, preserving the quality of the model remains
a challenge. To retain quality in previous aggressive quantization, we propose
a new fractional bits quantization (\short) approach. The novelty is a simple
yet effective idea: we progressively reduce the model's precision from 32 to 4
bits per parameter, and exploit the fractional bits during optimization to
maintain high generation quality. We show that the \short{} yields improved
quality on a variety of diffusion models, including SD3.5-Medium, Sana,
\pixart, and FLUX.1-schnell, while achieving $4-7\%$ lower FiD than standard
QAT. Finally, we deploy and run Sana on a Samsung S25U, which runs on the
Qualcomm SM8750-AB Snapdragon 8 Elite Hexagon Tensor Processor (HTP).

Motivation: 由于缺乏大规模体素级标注的肿瘤数据集，限制了AI在肿瘤分割方面的性能提升。作者发现合成数据可以显著减少对真实标注数据的需求。

Method: 创建了AbdomenAtlas 2.0数据集，包含10,135个CT扫描，由23名放射科专家在六个器官（胰腺、肝脏、肾脏、结肠、食管、子宫）上进行体素级肿瘤标注，并包含5,893个对照扫描。

Result: 在内部JHH数据集上发现，使用合成数据仅需500个真实扫描即可达到1,500个真实扫描的性能。AbdomenAtlas 2.0相比现有公共数据集，在分布内测试中DSC提升7%，分布外测试中提升16%。

Conclusion: 大规模高质量标注数据集可以显著提升肿瘤分割AI模型的性能，合成数据可以加速数据扩展规律，使模型训练更加高效。

Abstract: AI for tumor segmentation is limited by the lack of large, voxel-wise
annotated datasets, which are hard to create and require medical experts. In
our proprietary JHH dataset of 3,000 annotated pancreatic tumor scans, we found
that AI performance stopped improving after 1,500 scans. With synthetic data,
we reached the same performance using only 500 real scans. This finding
suggests that synthetic data can steepen data scaling laws, enabling more
efficient model training than real data alone. Motivated by these lessons, we
created AbdomenAtlas 2.0--a dataset of 10,135 CT scans with a total of 15,130
tumor instances per-voxel manually annotated in six organs (pancreas, liver,
kidney, colon, esophagus, and uterus) and 5,893 control scans. Annotated by 23
expert radiologists, it is several orders of magnitude larger than existing
public tumor datasets. While we continue expanding the dataset, the current
version of AbdomenAtlas 2.0 already provides a strong foundation--based on
lessons from the JHH dataset--for training AI to segment tumors in six organs.
It achieves notable improvements over public datasets, with a +7% DSC gain on
in-distribution tests and +16% on out-of-distribution tests.

Abstract: Video generation models have achieved remarkable progress, particularly
excelling in realistic scenarios; however, their performance degrades notably
in imaginative scenarios. These prompts often involve rarely co-occurring
concepts with long-distance semantic relationships, falling outside training
distributions. Existing methods typically apply test-time scaling for improving
video quality, but their fixed search spaces and static reward designs limit
adaptability to imaginative scenarios. To fill this gap, we propose
ImagerySearch, a prompt-guided adaptive test-time search strategy that
dynamically adjusts both the inference search space and reward function
according to semantic relationships in the prompt. This enables more coherent
and visually plausible videos in challenging imaginative settings. To evaluate
progress in this direction, we introduce LDT-Bench, the first dedicated
benchmark for long-distance semantic prompts, consisting of 2,839 diverse
concept pairs and an automated protocol for assessing creative generation
capabilities. Extensive experiments show that ImagerySearch consistently
outperforms strong video generation baselines and existing test-time scaling
approaches on LDT-Bench, and achieves competitive improvements on VBench,
demonstrating its effectiveness across diverse prompt types. We will release
LDT-Bench and code to facilitate future research on imaginative video
generation.

Method: 开发深度学习框架，同时进行皮肤病变分类和ABCD特征量化评分，模拟病变演变过程，并在潜在空间中可视化特征轨迹。

Conclusion: 该框架将机器学习诊断与临床相关标准联系起来，提高了对皮肤癌进展的理解，为医生提供了可解释的诊断工具。

Abstract: Early detection of melanoma has grown to be essential because it
significantly improves survival rates, but automated analysis of skin lesions
still remains challenging. ABCDE, which stands for Asymmetry, Border
irregularity, Color variation, Diameter, and Evolving, is a well-known
classification method for skin lesions, but most deep learning mechanisms treat
it as a black box, as most of the human interpretable features are not
explained. In this work, we propose a deep learning framework that both
classifies skin lesions into categories and also quantifies scores for each
ABCD feature. It simulates the evolution of these features over time in order
to represent the E aspect, opening more windows for future exploration. The A,
B, C, and D values are quantified particularly within this work. Moreover, this
framework also visualizes ABCD feature trajectories in latent space as skin
lesions evolve from benign nevuses to malignant melanoma. The experiments are
conducted using the HAM10000 dataset that contains around ten thousand images
of skin lesions of varying stages. In summary, the classification worked with
an accuracy of around 89 percent, with melanoma AUC being 0.96, while the
feature evaluation performed well in predicting asymmetry, color variation, and
diameter, though border irregularity remains more difficult to model. Overall,
this work provides a deep learning framework that will allow doctors to link ML
diagnoses to clinically relevant criteria, thus improving our understanding of
skin cancer progression.

sentiment_class). Recent trends go towards bi-modality, where images and text
are learned together, however, in order to truly understand the world, we need
to integrate all these independent modalities. In this work we try to combine
as many visual modalities as we can using little to no human supervision. In
order to do this, we use pre-trained experts and procedural combinations
between them on top of raw videos using a fully autonomous data-pipeline, which
we also open-source. We then make use of PHG-MAE, a model specifically designed
to leverage multi-modal data. We show that this model which was efficiently
distilled into a low-parameter (<1M) can have competitive results compared to
models of ~300M parameters. We deploy this model and analyze the use-case of
real-time semantic segmentation from handheld devices or webcams on commodity
hardware. Finally, we deploy other off-the-shelf models using the same
framework, such as DPT for near real-time depth estimation.

TL;DR: 系统评估多模态大语言模型在面部识别任务上的性能，发现其在零样本应用中落后于专用模型，但能捕捉丰富的语义线索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在视觉语言任务中表现优异，但在面部识别领域的潜力尚未充分探索，特别是开源模型需要在标准基准上与现有面部识别模型进行比较。

Method: 在多个面部识别数据集（LFW、CALFW、CPLFW、CFP、AgeDB和RFW）上对最先进的多模态大语言模型进行系统性基准测试。

Result: 实验结果显示，虽然多模态大语言模型能捕捉丰富的语义线索，但在零样本应用的高精度识别场景中落后于专用模型。

Conclusion: 该基准为推进基于多模态大语言模型的面部识别提供了基础，为设计具有更高准确性和泛化能力的下一代模型提供了见解。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable performance
across diverse vision-and-language tasks. However, their potential in face
recognition remains underexplored. In particular, the performance of
open-source MLLMs needs to be evaluated and compared with existing face
recognition models on standard benchmarks with similar protocol. In this work,
we present a systematic benchmark of state-of-the-art MLLMs for face
recognition on several face recognition datasets, including LFW, CALFW, CPLFW,
CFP, AgeDB and RFW. Experimental results reveal that while MLLMs capture rich
semantic cues useful for face-related tasks, they lag behind specialized models
in high-precision recognition scenarios in zero-shot applications. This
benchmark provides a foundation for advancing MLLM-based face recognition,
offering insights for the design of next-generation models with higher accuracy
and generalization. The source code of our benchmark is publicly available in
the project page.

*Guangyi Han,Wei Zhai,Yuhang Yang,Yang Cao,Zheng-Jun Zha*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Free-Form HOI生成方法，通过细粒度意图控制生成多样化、物理合理的手-物交互，超越了传统固定抓握模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有HOI生成研究局限于固定抓握模式，基于物理先验（如力闭合）或通用意图指令，无法捕捉日常HOI的多样性。

Method: 构建WildO2数据集（4.4k个交互，92种意图，610个物体类别），提出TOUCH三阶段框架，基于多级扩散模型实现细粒度语义控制，通过显式接触建模和物理约束优化。

Result: 能够生成可控、多样化且物理合理的手部交互，代表日常活动中的各种交互模式。

Conclusion: 该方法成功扩展了HOI从抓握到自由形式交互（如推、戳、旋转），为手-物交互生成提供了更灵活和真实的方法。

Abstract: Hand-object interaction (HOI) is fundamental for humans to express intent.
Existing HOI generation research is predominantly confined to fixed grasping
patterns, where control is tied to physical priors such as force closure or
generic intent instructions, even when expressed through elaborate language.
Such an overly general conditioning imposes a strong inductive bias for stable
grasps, thus failing to capture the diversity of daily HOI. To address these
limitations, we introduce Free-Form HOI Generation, which aims to generate
controllable, diverse, and physically plausible HOI conditioned on fine-grained
intent, extending HOI from grasping to free-form interactions, like pushing,
poking, and rotating. To support this task, we construct WildO2, an in-the-wild
diverse 3D HOI dataset, which includes diverse HOI derived from internet
videos. Specifically, it contains 4.4k unique interactions across 92 intents
and 610 object categories, each with detailed semantic annotations. Building on
this dataset, we propose TOUCH, a three-stage framework centered on a
multi-level diffusion model that facilitates fine-grained semantic control to
generate versatile hand poses beyond grasping priors. This process leverages
explicit contact modeling for conditioning and is subsequently refined with
contact consistency and physical constraints to ensure realism. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate our method's ability to generate controllable, diverse,
and physically plausible hand interactions representative of daily activities.

TL;DR: BADAS是一个基于真实世界行车记录仪碰撞数据训练的碰撞预测模型家族，专门针对自车威胁进行优化，在多个基准测试中达到最先进的性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有碰撞预测方法无法区分自车威胁和与自车无关的随机事故，导致实际部署中产生过多误报。

Method: 使用V-JEPA2骨干网络进行端到端训练，包含BADAS-Open（1.5k公开视频）和BADAS1.0（40k专有视频）两个变体，重新标注主要基准测试以识别自车参与情况。

Result: 在DAD、DADA-2000、DoTA和Nexar数据集上，BADAS实现了最先进的AP/AUC性能，优于前向碰撞ADAS基线，并产生更真实的事故时间估计。

Conclusion: BADAS通过专门的自车中心评估基准和重新标注策略，显著提升了碰撞预测的准确性和实用性，推动了自车中心碰撞预测研究的发展。

Abstract: Existing collision prediction methods often fail to distinguish between
ego-vehicle threats and random accidents not involving the ego vehicle, leading
to excessive false alerts in real-world deployment. We present BADAS, a family
of collision prediction models trained on Nexar's real-world dashcam collision
dataset -- the first benchmark designed explicitly for ego-centric evaluation.
We re-annotate major benchmarks to identify ego involvement, add consensus
alert-time labels, and synthesize negatives where needed, enabling fair AP/AUC
and temporal evaluation. BADAS uses a V-JEPA2 backbone trained end-to-end and
comes in two variants: BADAS-Open (trained on our 1.5k public videos) and
BADAS1.0 (trained on 40k proprietary videos). Across DAD, DADA-2000, DoTA, and
Nexar, BADAS achieves state-of-the-art AP/AUC and outperforms a
forward-collision ADAS baseline while producing more realistic time-to-accident
estimates. We release our BADAS-Open model weights and code, along with
re-annotations of all evaluation datasets to promote ego-centric collision
prediction research.

TL;DR: ScaleWeaver是一个基于视觉自回归模型的可控文本到图像生成框架，通过参数高效微调实现高保真度和精确控制，比基于扩散的方法更高效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然视觉自回归模型在生成保真度和推理效率方面取得了显著进展，但如何在VAR范式中实现精确灵活的控制机制仍然研究不足。

Method: 提出改进的MMDiT块和Reference Attention模块，通过丢弃图像→条件的非必要注意力来降低计算成本并稳定控制注入，同时强调参数重用，使用零初始化线性投影确保控制信号有效融入而不破坏基础模型的生成能力。

Result: 大量实验表明，ScaleWeaver能够实现高质量生成和精确控制，同时在效率上优于基于扩散的方法。

Conclusion: ScaleWeaver为视觉自回归范式中的可控文本到图像生成提供了一个实用有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-image generation with visual autoregressive~(VAR) models has recently
achieved impressive advances in generation fidelity and inference efficiency.
While control mechanisms have been explored for diffusion models, enabling
precise and flexible control within VAR paradigm remains underexplored. To
bridge this critical gap, in this paper, we introduce ScaleWeaver, a novel
framework designed to achieve high-fidelity, controllable generation upon
advanced VAR models through parameter-efficient fine-tuning. The core module in
ScaleWeaver is the improved MMDiT block with the proposed Reference Attention
module, which efficiently and effectively incorporates conditional information.
Different from MM Attention, the proposed Reference Attention module discards
the unnecessary attention from image$\rightarrow$condition, reducing
computational cost while stabilizing control injection. Besides, it
strategically emphasizes parameter reuse, leveraging the capability of the VAR
backbone itself with a few introduced parameters to process control
information, and equipping a zero-initialized linear projection to ensure that
control signals are incorporated effectively without disrupting the generative
capability of the base model. Extensive experiments show that ScaleWeaver
delivers high-quality generation and precise control while attaining superior
efficiency over diffusion-based methods, making ScaleWeaver a practical and
effective solution for controllable text-to-image generation within the visual
autoregressive paradigm. Code and models will be released.

TL;DR: 提出了nlg2choice方法，通过两阶段处理解决多模态大语言模型在细粒度视觉分类中处理自由形式响应和大量选项的评估难题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注纯语言任务或不超过5个选项的多选题，无法有效处理细粒度视觉分类中数百到数千个高度相关选项的场景，且难以扩展到基于检索的问题。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：首先向MLLM提出开放式问题，然后使用纯文本约束解码预测最可能的选项；在检索设置中，使用提前停止方法计算约束响应的概率以提高吞吐量。

Result: 在七个细粒度视觉数据集上的实验表明，该方法在分类和检索任务上均有改进，且性能在不同自然语言任务实现方式下保持稳定。

Conclusion: nlg2choice方法有效解决了MLLM在细粒度视觉分类中处理大量选项和自由形式响应的评估挑战，在分类和检索任务上均表现出色。

Abstract: Despite the renewed interest in zero-shot visual classification due to the
rise of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), the problem of evaluating
free-form responses of auto-regressive models remains a persistent challenge.
Most existing works focus on language-only tasks or don't consider Multiple
Choice Questions (MCQs) beyond 5-way options, both of which are critical
capabilities to solve tasks in Fine-Grained Visual Classification (FGVC) where
choice counts are in the hundreds to thousands and the choices are highly
related. Furthermore, in this highly multi-way MCQ setting it is not clear how
to extend LLM choice extraction to retrieval-based problems, where computing
probabilities over the choice set is computationally costly. In this work we
investigate nlg2choice, a simple two-stage method which first asks the MLLM an
open-ended question for the task with minimal constraints, then uses text-only
constrained decoding to predict the most likely choice. In retrieval settings,
we compute the probability of the constrained response taking that choice with
an early stopping method to significantly improve throughput. Our results show
improvement over a suite of seven fine-grained visual datasets when evaluating
in terms of classification and retrieval, and show that this performance holds
over the various ways that users of LLMs can implement tasks in natural
language.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有半监督视频异常检测方法难以检测涉及对象交互的复杂异常，且缺乏可解释性

Method: 使用MLLM分析不同时刻的对象对视觉输入，生成活动与交互的文本描述作为高级表示，通过比较训练视频和测试视频的文本描述来检测异常

Result: 在基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法能有效检测基于交互的复杂异常，并在无交互异常的数据集上达到最先进性能

Conclusion: 该方法不仅能检测复杂交互异常，还提供内在可解释性，可与传统VAD方法结合进一步提升可解释性

Abstract: Existing semi-supervised video anomaly detection (VAD) methods often struggle
with detecting complex anomalies involving object interactions and generally
lack explainability. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel VAD
framework leveraging Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Unlike previous
MLLM-based approaches that make direct anomaly judgments at the frame level,
our method focuses on extracting and interpreting object activity and
interactions over time. By querying an MLLM with visual inputs of object pairs
at different moments, we generate textual descriptions of the activity and
interactions from nominal videos. These textual descriptions serve as a
high-level representation of the activity and interactions of objects in a
video. They are used to detect anomalies during test time by comparing them to
textual descriptions found in nominal training videos. Our approach inherently
provides explainability and can be combined with many traditional VAD methods
to further enhance their interpretability. Extensive experiments on benchmark
datasets demonstrate that our method not only detects complex interaction-based
anomalies effectively but also achieves state-of-the-art performance on
datasets without interaction anomalies.

Conclusion: 提出的合成字幕生成方法和MaskCaptioner模型有效解决了DVOC任务中的标注瓶颈，实现了端到端的联合检测、分割、跟踪和描述

Abstract: Dense Video Object Captioning (DVOC) is the task of jointly detecting,
tracking, and captioning object trajectories in a video, requiring the ability
to understand spatio-temporal details and describe them in natural language.
Due to the complexity of the task and the high cost associated with manual
annotation, previous approaches resort to disjoint training strategies,
potentially leading to suboptimal performance. To circumvent this issue, we
propose to generate captions about spatio-temporally localized entities
leveraging a state-of-the-art VLM. By extending the LVIS and LV-VIS datasets
with our synthetic captions (LVISCap and LV-VISCap), we train MaskCaptioner, an
end-to-end model capable of jointly detecting, segmenting, tracking and
captioning object trajectories. Moreover, with pretraining on LVISCap and
LV-VISCap, MaskCaptioner achieves state-of-the-art DVOC results on three
existing benchmarks, VidSTG, VLN and BenSMOT. The datasets and code are
available at https://www.gabriel.fiastre.fr/maskcaptioner/.

TL;DR: 3DScenePrompt是一个视频生成框架，通过双时空条件机制和3D场景记忆实现长视频生成，支持精确相机控制并保持场景一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常基于单张图像或短片段进行视频生成，难以在长视频生成中保持场景一致性和精确相机控制，特别是在跨越时间边界时动态元素会错误保留。

Method: 采用双时空条件机制：时间相邻帧用于运动连续性，空间相邻内容用于场景一致性。引入3D场景记忆存储从输入视频提取的静态几何，通过动态SLAM和动态掩码策略分离静态场景和动态元素。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在场景一致性、相机可控性和生成质量方面显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 3DScenePrompt通过静态场景表示和动态区域自然演化，成功实现了长视频生成中的空间连贯性和精确相机控制，同时保持计算效率和运动真实性。

Abstract: We present 3DScenePrompt, a framework that generates the next video chunk
from arbitrary-length input while enabling precise camera control and
preserving scene consistency. Unlike methods conditioned on a single image or a
short clip, we employ dual spatio-temporal conditioning that reformulates
context-view referencing across the input video. Our approach conditions on
both temporally adjacent frames for motion continuity and spatially adjacent
content for scene consistency. However, when generating beyond temporal
boundaries, directly using spatially adjacent frames would incorrectly preserve
dynamic elements from the past. We address this by introducing a 3D scene
memory that represents exclusively the static geometry extracted from the
entire input video. To construct this memory, we leverage dynamic SLAM with our
newly introduced dynamic masking strategy that explicitly separates static
scene geometry from moving elements. The static scene representation can then
be projected to any target viewpoint, providing geometrically consistent warped
views that serve as strong 3D spatial prompts while allowing dynamic regions to
evolve naturally from temporal context. This enables our model to maintain
long-range spatial coherence and precise camera control without sacrificing
computational efficiency or motion realism. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our framework significantly outperforms existing methods in scene
consistency, camera controllability, and generation quality. Project page :

Abstract: Whole-body multi-modal human motion generation poses two primary challenges:
creating an effective motion generation mechanism and integrating various
modalities, such as text, speech, and music, into a cohesive framework. Unlike
previous methods that usually employ discrete masked modeling or autoregressive
modeling, we develop a continuous masked autoregressive motion transformer,
where a causal attention is performed considering the sequential nature within
the human motion. Within this transformer, we introduce a gated linear
attention and an RMSNorm module, which drive the transformer to pay attention
to the key actions and suppress the instability caused by either the abnormal
movements or the heterogeneous distributions within multi-modalities. To
further enhance both the motion generation and the multimodal generalization,
we employ the DiT structure to diffuse the conditions from the transformer
towards the targets. To fuse different modalities, AdaLN and cross-attention
are leveraged to inject the text, speech, and music signals. Experimental
results demonstrate that our framework outperforms previous methods across all
modalities, including text-to-motion, speech-to-gesture, and music-to-dance.
The code of our method will be made public.

Conclusion: RealDPO通过真实世界数据驱动的偏好学习，有效提升了视频生成模型的运动合成质量，为解决复杂运动生成挑战提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Video generative models have recently achieved notable advancements in
synthesis quality. However, generating complex motions remains a critical
challenge, as existing models often struggle to produce natural, smooth, and
contextually consistent movements. This gap between generated and real-world
motions limits their practical applicability. To address this issue, we
introduce RealDPO, a novel alignment paradigm that leverages real-world data as
positive samples for preference learning, enabling more accurate motion
synthesis. Unlike traditional supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which offers
limited corrective feedback, RealDPO employs Direct Preference Optimization
(DPO) with a tailored loss function to enhance motion realism. By contrasting
real-world videos with erroneous model outputs, RealDPO enables iterative
self-correction, progressively refining motion quality. To support
post-training in complex motion synthesis, we propose RealAction-5K, a curated
dataset of high-quality videos capturing human daily activities with rich and
precise motion details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RealDPO
significantly improves video quality, text alignment, and motion realism
compared to state-of-the-art models and existing preference optimization
techniques.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have excelled in textual reasoning, they
struggle with mathematical domains like geometry that intrinsically rely on
visual aids. Existing approaches to Visual Chain-of-Thought (VCoT) are often
limited by rigid external tools or fail to generate the high-fidelity,
strategically-timed diagrams necessary for complex problem-solving. To bridge
this gap, we introduce MathCanvas, a comprehensive framework designed to endow
unified Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) with intrinsic VCoT capabilities for
mathematics. Our approach consists of two phases. First, a Visual Manipulation
stage pre-trains the model on a novel 15.2M-pair corpus, comprising 10M
caption-to-diagram pairs (MathCanvas-Imagen) and 5.2M step-by-step editing
trajectories (MathCanvas-Edit), to master diagram generation and editing.
Second, a Strategic Visual-Aided Reasoning stage fine-tunes the model on
MathCanvas-Instruct, a new 219K-example dataset of interleaved visual-textual
reasoning paths, teaching it when and how to leverage visual aids. To
facilitate rigorous evaluation, we introduce MathCanvas-Bench, a challenging
benchmark with 3K problems that require models to produce interleaved
visual-textual solutions. Our model, BAGEL-Canvas, trained under this
framework, achieves an 86% relative improvement over strong LMM baselines on
MathCanvas-Bench, demonstrating excellent generalization to other public math
benchmarks. Our work provides a complete toolkit-framework, datasets, and
benchmark-to unlock complex, human-like visual-aided reasoning in LMMs. Project

TL;DR: C4D是一个从单目视频恢复4D（动态几何和相机姿态）的框架，通过引入短期光流和长期点跟踪的时序对应关系，扩展了现有的3D重建方法到动态场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的点图式3D重建方法（如DUSt3R）在静态场景中表现良好，但直接应用于动态场景会导致不准确结果，因为运动物体违反了多视图几何约束。

Method: C4D预测点图并捕获两种对应关系：短期光流和长期点跟踪。训练动态感知点跟踪器提供移动性信息，估计运动掩码分离移动元素和静态背景。引入动态场景优化目标恢复每帧3D几何和相机参数，并将2D轨迹提升为平滑3D轨迹。

Result: 实验表明，C4D实现了完整的4D恢复，在深度估计、相机姿态估计和点跟踪等多个下游任务中表现出色。

Conclusion: C4D框架通过时序对应关系成功扩展了3D重建到4D，能够有效处理动态场景，实现动态几何和相机姿态的联合估计。

Abstract: Recovering 4D from monocular video, which jointly estimates dynamic geometry
and camera poses, is an inevitably challenging problem. While recent
pointmap-based 3D reconstruction methods (e.g., DUSt3R) have made great
progress in reconstructing static scenes, directly applying them to dynamic
scenes leads to inaccurate results. This discrepancy arises because moving
objects violate multi-view geometric constraints, disrupting the
reconstruction. To address this, we introduce C4D, a framework that leverages
temporal Correspondences to extend existing 3D reconstruction formulation to
4D. Specifically, apart from predicting pointmaps, C4D captures two types of
correspondences: short-term optical flow and long-term point tracking. We train
a dynamic-aware point tracker that provides additional mobility information,
facilitating the estimation of motion masks to separate moving elements from
the static background, thus offering more reliable guidance for dynamic scenes.
Furthermore, we introduce a set of dynamic scene optimization objectives to
recover per-frame 3D geometry and camera parameters. Simultaneously, the
correspondences lift 2D trajectories into smooth 3D trajectories, enabling
fully integrated 4D reconstruction. Experiments show that our framework
achieves complete 4D recovery and demonstrates strong performance across
multiple downstream tasks, including depth estimation, camera pose estimation,
and point tracking. Project Page: https://littlepure2333.github.io/C4D

<details>

Motivation: 现有扩散模型在降水临近预报中存在可扩展性问题：潜在空间方法需要单独的自编码器，增加了复杂性；像素空间方法计算密集且缺乏注意力机制，难以建模长程时空依赖。

Method: 在U-Net扩散模型和时空编码器中集成Token-wise Attention，动态捕获多尺度空间交互和时间演化，无需单独潜在模块。

Conclusion: 提出的方法通过原生集成注意力机制，解决了现有扩散模型的可扩展性问题，为降水临近预报提供了高效且性能优越的解决方案。

Abstract: Precipitation nowcasting, predicting future radar echo sequences from current
observations, is a critical yet challenging task due to the inherently chaotic
and tightly coupled spatio-temporal dynamics of the atmosphere. While recent
advances in diffusion-based models attempt to capture both large-scale motion
and fine-grained stochastic variability, they often suffer from scalability
issues: latent-space approaches require a separately trained autoencoder,
adding complexity and limiting generalization, while pixel-space approaches are
computationally intensive and often omit attention mechanisms, reducing their
ability to model long-range spatio-temporal dependencies. To address these
limitations, we propose a Token-wise Attention integrated into not only the
U-Net diffusion model but also the spatio-temporal encoder that dynamically
captures multi-scale spatial interactions and temporal evolution. Unlike prior
approaches, our method natively integrates attention into the architecture
without incurring the high resource cost typical of pixel-space diffusion,
thereby eliminating the need for separate latent modules. Our extensive
experiments and visual evaluations across diverse datasets demonstrate that the
proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, yielding
superior local fidelity, generalization, and robustness in complex
precipitation forecasting scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了ChangingGrounding基准测试和Mem-ChangingGrounder方法，用于解决动态场景下的3D视觉定位问题，通过利用历史观察和选择性探索来减少重新扫描成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D视觉定位方法假设场景点云是重建且最新的，这在实际动态场景中需要频繁重新扫描，成本高昂且阻碍部署。

Method: 提出Mem-ChangingGrounder方法：通过跨模态检索识别查询对象类型，检索相关记忆指导行动，在场景中高效探索目标，无效时回退，执行多视角扫描，并将融合证据投影得到精确边界框。

Result: 在ChangingGrounding基准测试中，Mem-ChangingGrounder实现了最高的定位精度，同时大幅降低了探索成本。

Conclusion: 该基准和方法推动了面向实际应用的、以记忆为中心的3D视觉定位研究发展。

Abstract: Real-world robots localize objects from natural-language instructions while
scenes around them keep changing. Yet most of the existing 3D visual grounding
(3DVG) method still assumes a reconstructed and up-to-date point cloud, an
assumption that forces costly re-scans and hinders deployment. We argue that
3DVG should be formulated as an active, memory-driven problem, and we introduce
ChangingGrounding, the first benchmark that explicitly measures how well an
agent can exploit past observations, explore only where needed, and still
deliver precise 3D boxes in changing scenes. To set a strong reference point,
we also propose Mem-ChangingGrounder, a zero-shot method for this task that
marries cross-modal retrieval with lightweight multi-view fusion: it identifies
the object type implied by the query, retrieves relevant memories to guide
actions, then explores the target efficiently in the scene, falls back when
previous operations are invalid, performs multi-view scanning of the target,
and projects the fused evidence from multi-view scans to get accurate object
bounding boxes. We evaluate different baselines on ChangingGrounding, and our
Mem-ChangingGrounder achieves the highest localization accuracy while greatly
reducing exploration cost. We hope this benchmark and method catalyze a shift
toward practical, memory-centric 3DVG research for real-world applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了WithAnyone模型，通过构建MultiID-2M数据集、引入对比身份损失来缓解文本到图像生成中的copy-paste问题，在保持身份一致性的同时提高生成多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有身份一致性生成模型因缺乏大规模配对数据集而依赖重建训练，导致copy-paste问题——直接复制参考人脸而非保持身份在姿态、表情或光照变化中的一致性，限制了生成的可控性和表达能力。

Method: 构建MultiID-2M大规模配对数据集；提出量化copy-paste伪影和身份保真度与变化权衡的基准；引入基于对比身份损失的新训练范式，利用配对数据平衡保真度与多样性。

Result: WithAnyone模型显著减少copy-paste伪影，提高姿态和表情的可控性，保持强感知质量。用户研究验证该方法在实现高身份保真度的同时支持表达性可控生成。

Conclusion: 通过数据集构建、基准制定和对比损失设计，WithAnyone有效缓解copy-paste问题，在身份一致性和生成多样性之间取得良好平衡。

Abstract: Identity-consistent generation has become an important focus in text-to-image
research, with recent models achieving notable success in producing images
aligned with a reference identity. Yet, the scarcity of large-scale paired
datasets containing multiple images of the same individual forces most
approaches to adopt reconstruction-based training. This reliance often leads to
a failure mode we term copy-paste, where the model directly replicates the
reference face rather than preserving identity across natural variations in
pose, expression, or lighting. Such over-similarity undermines controllability
and limits the expressive power of generation. To address these limitations, we
(1) construct a large-scale paired dataset MultiID-2M, tailored for
multi-person scenarios, providing diverse references for each identity; (2)
introduce a benchmark that quantifies both copy-paste artifacts and the
trade-off between identity fidelity and variation; and (3) propose a novel
training paradigm with a contrastive identity loss that leverages paired data
to balance fidelity with diversity. These contributions culminate in
WithAnyone, a diffusion-based model that effectively mitigates copy-paste while
preserving high identity similarity. Extensive qualitative and quantitative
experiments demonstrate that WithAnyone significantly reduces copy-paste
artifacts, improves controllability over pose and expression, and maintains
strong perceptual quality. User studies further validate that our method
achieves high identity fidelity while enabling expressive controllable
generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Terra是一个原生3D世界模型，使用内在3D潜在空间来表示和生成可探索的环境，通过点到高斯变分自编码器和稀疏点流匹配网络实现高3D一致性的世界建模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有世界模型大多依赖像素对齐表示，忽略了物理世界的固有3D特性，这会破坏3D一致性并降低建模效率。

Method: 提出点对高斯变分自编码器(P2G-VAE)将3D输入编码为潜在点表示，然后解码为3D高斯基元来联合建模几何和外观；引入稀疏点流匹配网络(SPFlow)生成潜在点表示，同时对点的位置和特征进行去噪。

Result: 在ScanNet v2室内场景上的实验表明，Terra在重建和生成方面都达到了最先进的性能，具有很高的3D一致性。

Conclusion: Terra通过原生3D表示和架构实现了精确的多视角一致性，支持单次生成过程从任意视角灵活渲染，并通过点潜在空间中的渐进生成实现了可探索的世界建模。

Abstract: World models have garnered increasing attention for comprehensive modeling of
the real world. However, most existing methods still rely on pixel-aligned
representations as the basis for world evolution, neglecting the inherent 3D
nature of the physical world. This could undermine the 3D consistency and
diminish the modeling efficiency of world models. In this paper, we present
Terra, a native 3D world model that represents and generates explorable
environments in an intrinsic 3D latent space. Specifically, we propose a novel
point-to-Gaussian variational autoencoder (P2G-VAE) that encodes 3D inputs into
a latent point representation, which is subsequently decoded as 3D Gaussian
primitives to jointly model geometry and appearance. We then introduce a sparse
point flow matching network (SPFlow) for generating the latent point
representation, which simultaneously denoises the positions and features of the
point latents. Our Terra enables exact multi-view consistency with native 3D
representation and architecture, and supports flexible rendering from any
viewpoint with only a single generation process. Furthermore, Terra achieves
explorable world modeling through progressive generation in the point latent
space. We conduct extensive experiments on the challenging indoor scenes from
ScanNet v2. Terra achieves state-of-the-art performance in both reconstruction
and generation with high 3D consistency.

TL;DR: 提出无需配对数据的图像编辑训练新范式，通过扩散模型展开训练和视觉语言模型反馈进行端到端优化，在少步设置下性能媲美监督学习方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像编辑模型依赖大规模输入-目标配对数据进行监督微调，但这类自然配对数据难以大规模获取，而现有使用合成数据的方法会传播预训练模型的缺陷

Method: 通过展开扩散模型训练，利用视觉语言模型评估编辑是否遵循指令并保留未改变内容，提供直接梯度进行端到端优化，同时结合分布匹配损失确保视觉保真度

Result: 在标准基准测试中，无需任何配对数据的情况下，在少步设置下性能与使用大量监督配对数据训练的图像编辑扩散模型相当，且优于基于强化学习的方法如Flow-GRPO

Conclusion: 该方法成功消除了对配对数据的依赖，提供了一种更高效、更少人工标注的图像编辑模型训练范式

Abstract: Recent image editing models have achieved impressive results while following
natural language editing instructions, but they rely on supervised fine-tuning
with large datasets of input-target pairs. This is a critical bottleneck, as
such naturally occurring pairs are hard to curate at scale. Current workarounds
use synthetic training pairs that leverage the zero-shot capabilities of
existing models. However, this can propagate and magnify the artifacts of the
pretrained model into the final trained model. In this work, we present a new
training paradigm that eliminates the need for paired data entirely. Our
approach directly optimizes a few-step diffusion model by unrolling it during
training and leveraging feedback from vision-language models (VLMs). For each
input and editing instruction, the VLM evaluates if an edit follows the
instruction and preserves unchanged content, providing direct gradients for
end-to-end optimization. To ensure visual fidelity, we incorporate distribution
matching loss (DMD), which constrains generated images to remain within the
image manifold learned by pretrained models. We evaluate our method on standard
benchmarks and include an extensive ablation study. Without any paired data,
our method performs on par with various image editing diffusion models trained
on extensive supervised paired data, under the few-step setting. Given the same
VLM as the reward model, we also outperform RL-based techniques like Flow-GRPO.

TL;DR: 本文提出了NEO原生视觉语言模型系列，通过设计三个核心原则来解决原生VLM与模块化VLM的区别和可访问性问题，在仅使用3.9亿图像-文本对的情况下实现了与顶级模块化模型相媲美的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决原生视觉语言模型面临的两个关键挑战：明确与模块化VLM的根本区别及如何克服这些障碍，以及如何使原生VLM研究更加可访问和民主化。

Method: 提出三个核心构建原则：(i)在共享语义空间中有效对齐像素和词表示；(ii)无缝整合视觉和语言模块的优势；(iii)内在体现支持统一视觉语言编码、对齐和推理的跨模态特性。基于这些原则构建NEO模型系列。

Result: NEO模型在多样化现实场景中能够与顶级模块化模型竞争，仅使用3.9亿图像-文本对就能从零开始高效发展视觉感知能力，同时在密集单一模型中缓解视觉语言冲突。

Conclusion: NEO为可扩展和强大的原生VLM奠定了基石，提供了丰富的可重用组件，促进了成本效益高且可扩展的生态系统发展。

Abstract: The edifice of native Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has emerged as a rising
contender to typical modular VLMs, shaped by evolving model architectures and
training paradigms. Yet, two lingering clouds cast shadows over its widespread
exploration and promotion: (-) What fundamental constraints set native VLMs
apart from modular ones, and to what extent can these barriers be overcome? (-)
How to make research in native VLMs more accessible and democratized, thereby
accelerating progress in the field. In this paper, we clarify these challenges
and outline guiding principles for constructing native VLMs. Specifically, one
native VLM primitive should: (i) effectively align pixel and word
representations within a shared semantic space; (ii) seamlessly integrate the
strengths of formerly separate vision and language modules; (iii) inherently
embody various cross-modal properties that support unified vision-language
encoding, aligning, and reasoning. Hence, we launch NEO, a novel family of
native VLMs built from first principles, capable of rivaling top-tier modular
counterparts across diverse real-world scenarios. With only 390M image-text
examples, NEO efficiently develops visual perception from scratch while
mitigating vision-language conflicts inside a dense and monolithic model
crafted from our elaborate primitives. We position NEO as a cornerstone for
scalable and powerful native VLMs, paired with a rich set of reusable
components that foster a cost-effective and extensible ecosystem. Our code and
models are publicly available at: https://github.com/EvolvingLMMs-Lab/NEO.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有2D图像编辑模型在多视角图像编辑时缺乏跨视角一致性，而基于显式3D表示的方法存在优化过程长、稀疏视角下不稳定的问题。

Method: 采用隐式3D正则化方法，通过耦合扩散采样同时从多视角图像分布和2D编辑图像分布采样两个轨迹，使用耦合项强制生成图像的多视角一致性。

Result: 在三个不同的多视角图像编辑任务上验证了该框架的有效性和通用性，展示了其适用于各种模型架构的潜力。

Conclusion: 该方法为多视角一致编辑提供了一个通用解决方案，避免了显式3D优化的复杂性。

Abstract: We present an inference-time diffusion sampling method to perform multi-view
consistent image editing using pre-trained 2D image editing models. These
models can independently produce high-quality edits for each image in a set of
multi-view images of a 3D scene or object, but they do not maintain consistency
across views. Existing approaches typically address this by optimizing over
explicit 3D representations, but they suffer from a lengthy optimization
process and instability under sparse view settings. We propose an implicit 3D
regularization approach by constraining the generated 2D image sequences to
adhere to a pre-trained multi-view image distribution. This is achieved through
coupled diffusion sampling, a simple diffusion sampling technique that
concurrently samples two trajectories from both a multi-view image distribution
and a 2D edited image distribution, using a coupling term to enforce the
multi-view consistency among the generated images. We validate the
effectiveness and generality of this framework on three distinct multi-view
image editing tasks, demonstrating its applicability across various model
architectures and highlighting its potential as a general solution for
multi-view consistent editing.

TL;DR: 提出DRIP方法，结合强化学习和扩散模型，通过RL预训练策略提供先验动作分布来正则化扩散训练过程，在推理阶段通过去噪过程将粗糙先验细化为精确动作分布，提高狭窄空间停车规划的准确性和成功率。

Motivation: 狭窄复杂环境中需要高精度操作来实现高规划成功率，但现有方法依赖显式动作建模，难以准确建模最优动作分布。

Method: 基于强化学习先验动作分布的扩散精炼规划器，RL预训练策略提供先验分布正则化扩散训练，推理时通过去噪过程精炼粗糙先验为精确动作分布。

Result: 在不同空间约束的停车场景中，该方法显著提高了狭窄空间停车环境的规划性能，同时在常见场景中保持强泛化能力。

Conclusion: DRIP方法通过结合强化学习先验和扩散精炼，实现了更准确的动作建模、更高的规划成功率和更少的推理步骤，在受限空间停车规划中表现优异。

Abstract: The growing demand for parking has increased the need for automated parking
planning methods that can operate reliably in confined spaces. In restricted
and complex environments, high-precision maneuvers are required to achieve a
high success rate in planning, yet existing approaches often rely on explicit
action modeling, which faces challenges when accurately modeling the optimal
action distribution. In this paper, we propose DRIP, a diffusion-refined
planner anchored in reinforcement learning (RL) prior action distribution, in
which an RL-pretrained policy provides prior action distributions to regularize
the diffusion training process. During the inference phase the denoising
process refines these coarse priors into more precise action distributions. By
steering the denoising trajectory through the reinforcement learning prior
distribution during training, the diffusion model inherits a well-informed
initialization, resulting in more accurate action modeling, a higher planning
success rate, and reduced inference steps. We evaluate our approach across
parking scenarios with varying degrees of spatial constraints. Experimental
results demonstrate that our method significantly improves planning performance
in confined-space parking environments while maintaining strong generalization
in common scenarios.

Motivation: 解决电磁监视中独立于发射器参数定位未知信号的关键挑战，研究巡逻形状和天线类型如何影响信息获取和三角测量覆盖范围。

Method: 采用差分进化算法生成几何巡逻路线，模拟四机器人群体在八种配置下的行为，使用全向或定向天线，随机化发射器位置、功率和频率进行测试。

Result: 定向天线平均检测成功率98.75%，全向天线80.25%；定向天线定位误差1.01-1.30米，全向天线1.67-1.90米；定向天线巡逻边更短。

Conclusion: 群体预测电磁现象的能力直接依赖于其与环境的物理交互，通过优化巡逻路线和天线选择实现的空间智能是有效机器人监视的关键设计考虑因素。

Abstract: This paper introduces a method for designing spatially intelligent robot
swarm behaviors to localize concealed radio emitters. We use differential
evolution to generate geometric patrol routes that localize unknown signals
independently of emitter parameters, a key challenge in electromagnetic
surveillance. Patrol shape and antenna type are shown to influence information
gain, which in turn determines the effective triangulation coverage. We
simulate a four-robot swarm across eight configurations, assigning
pre-generated patrol routes based on a specified patrol shape and sensing
capability (antenna type: omnidirectional or directional). An emitter is placed
within the map for each trial, with randomized position, transmission power and
frequency. Results show that omnidirectional localization success rates are
driven primarily by source location rather than signal properties, with
failures occurring most often when sources are placed in peripheral areas of
the map. Directional antennas are able to overcome this limitation due to their
higher gain and directivity, with an average detection success rate of 98.75%
compared to 80.25% for omnidirectional. Average localization errors range from
1.01-1.30 m for directional sensing and 1.67-1.90 m for omnidirectional
sensing; while directional sensing also benefits from shorter patrol edges.
These results demonstrate that a swarm's ability to predict electromagnetic
phenomena is directly dependent on its physical interaction with the
environment. Consequently, spatial intelligence, realized here through
optimized patrol routes and antenna selection, is a critical design
consideration for effective robotic surveillance.

Abstract: Multi-Agent Task Assignment and Planning (MATP) has attracted growing
attention but remains challenging in terms of scalability, spatial reasoning,
and adaptability in obstacle-rich environments. To address these challenges, we
propose OATH: Adaptive Obstacle-Aware Task Assignment and Planning for
Heterogeneous Robot Teaming, which advances MATP by introducing a novel
obstacle-aware strategy for task assignment. First, we develop an adaptive
Halton sequence map, the first known application of Halton sampling with
obstacle-aware adaptation in MATP, which adjusts sampling density based on
obstacle distribution. Second, we propose a cluster-auction-selection framework
that integrates obstacle-aware clustering with weighted auctions and
intra-cluster task selection. These mechanisms jointly enable effective
coordination among heterogeneous robots while maintaining scalability and
near-optimal allocation performance. In addition, our framework leverages an
LLM to interpret human instructions and directly guide the planner in real
time. We validate OATH in NVIDIA Isaac Sim, showing substantial improvements in
task assignment quality, scalability, adaptability to dynamic changes, and
overall execution performance compared to state-of-the-art MATP baselines. A

Motivation: TAMP在机器人操作中需要长时程推理，但规划具有不确定性的概率动作仍然具有挑战性。而强化学习擅长获取鲁棒的短时程操作技能，但缺乏长时程规划能力。

Method: 将RL技能集成到TAMP流程中，为每个RL技能定义数据驱动的逻辑组件，使其能够被符号规划器使用，并设计计划细化子程序来处理效果不确定性。

Result: 实验表明，该方法相比基线分层规划方法在TAMP和RL领域都表现出优势，能够将TAMP扩展到具有概率技能的领域，并提高规划效率。

Conclusion: 通过嵌入RL技能，扩展了TAMP在概率技能领域的能力，相比先前方法提高了规划效率。

Abstract: Task and motion planning (TAMP) for robotics manipulation necessitates
long-horizon reasoning involving versatile actions and skills. While
deterministic actions can be crafted by sampling or optimizing with certain
constraints, planning actions with uncertainty, i.e., probabilistic actions,
remains a challenge for TAMP. On the contrary, Reinforcement Learning (RL)
excels in acquiring versatile, yet short-horizon, manipulation skills that are
robust with uncertainties. In this letter, we design a method that integrates
RL skills into TAMP pipelines. Besides the policy, a RL skill is defined with
data-driven logical components that enable the skill to be deployed by symbolic
planning. A plan refinement sub-routine is designed to further tackle the
inevitable effect uncertainties. In the experiments, we compare our method with
baseline hierarchical planning from both TAMP and RL fields and illustrate the
strength of the method. The results show that by embedding RL skills, we extend
the capability of TAMP to domains with probabilistic skills, and improve the
planning efficiency compared to the previous methods.

Abstract: In this work, we present a novel control approach based on partial feedback

an attached load. Such systems are envisioned for various applications in
construction sites involving cranes, such as the holding and transportation of
heavy objects. Our proposed control approach considers the underactuation of
the whole system while utilizing its coupled dynamics for stabilization. We
demonstrate using numerical stability analysis that these coupled terms are
crucial for the stabilization of the complete system. We also carried out
robustness analysis of the proposed approach in the presence of external wind
disturbances, sensor noise, and uncertainties in system dynamics. As our
envisioned target application involves cranes in outdoor construction sites,
our control approaches rely on only onboard sensors, thus making it suitable
for such applications. We carried out extensive simulation studies and
experimental tests to validate our proposed control approach.

Abstract: Robotic pushing is a fundamental manipulation task that requires tactile
feedback to capture subtle contact forces and dynamics between the end-effector
and the object. However, real tactile sensors often face hardware limitations
such as high costs and fragility, and deployment challenges involving
calibration and variations between different sensors, while vision-only
policies struggle with satisfactory performance. Inspired by humans' ability to
infer tactile states from vision, we propose ViTacGen, a novel robot
manipulation framework designed for visual robotic pushing with vision-to-touch
generation in reinforcement learning to eliminate the reliance on
high-resolution real tactile sensors, enabling effective zero-shot deployment
on visual-only robotic systems. Specifically, ViTacGen consists of an
encoder-decoder vision-to-touch generation network that generates contact depth
images, a standardized tactile representation, directly from visual image
sequence, followed by a reinforcement learning policy that fuses visual-tactile
data with contrastive learning based on visual and generated tactile
observations. We validate the effectiveness of our approach in both simulation
and real world experiments, demonstrating its superior performance and
achieving a success rate of up to 86\%.

Abstract: Manipulating three-dimensional (3D) deformable objects presents significant
challenges for robotic systems due to their infinite-dimensional state space
and complex deformable dynamics. This paper proposes a novel model-free
approach for shape control with constraints imposed on key points. Unlike
existing methods that rely on feature dimensionality reduction, the proposed
controller leverages the coordinates of key points as the feature vector, which
are extracted from the deformable object's point cloud using deep learning
methods. This approach not only reduces the dimensionality of the feature space
but also retains the spatial information of the object. By extracting key
points, the manipulation of deformable objects is simplified into a visual
servoing problem, where the shape dynamics are described using a deformation
Jacobian matrix. To enhance control accuracy, a prescribed performance control
method is developed by integrating barrier Lyapunov functions (BLF) to enforce
constraints on the key points. The stability of the closed-loop system is
rigorously analyzed and verified using the Lyapunov method. Experimental
results further demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed
method.

Abstract: Human-humanoid collaboration shows significant promise for applications in
healthcare, domestic assistance, and manufacturing. While compliant robot-human
collaboration has been extensively developed for robotic arms, enabling
compliant human-humanoid collaboration remains largely unexplored due to
humanoids' complex whole-body dynamics. In this paper, we propose a
proprioception-only reinforcement learning approach, COLA, that combines leader
and follower behaviors within a single policy. The model is trained in a
closed-loop environment with dynamic object interactions to predict object
motion patterns and human intentions implicitly, enabling compliant
collaboration to maintain load balance through coordinated trajectory planning.
We evaluate our approach through comprehensive simulator and real-world
experiments on collaborative carrying tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness,
generalization, and robustness of our model across various terrains and
objects. Simulation experiments demonstrate that our model reduces human effort
by 24.7%. compared to baseline approaches while maintaining object stability.
Real-world experiments validate robust collaborative carrying across different
object types (boxes, desks, stretchers, etc.) and movement patterns
(straight-line, turning, slope climbing). Human user studies with 23
participants confirm an average improvement of 27.4% compared to baseline
models. Our method enables compliant human-humanoid collaborative carrying
without requiring external sensors or complex interaction models, offering a
practical solution for real-world deployment.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: AdaMoE是一种基于混合专家(MoE)架构的视觉-语言-动作模型，通过继承预训练的密集VLA模型权重，将前馈层替换为稀疏激活的MoE层来实现模型扩展，解决了VLA模型扩展中的计算资源需求和实时控制效率问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决VLA模型扩展的两个关键挑战：(1)从头训练VLA模型需要大量计算资源和数据集，而机器人数据稀缺，需要充分利用预训练权重；(2)实时控制需要平衡模型容量与计算效率。

Method: 提出AdaMoE架构，采用解耦技术将专家选择与专家权重分配分离，通过独立的尺度适配器与传统路由器协同工作，实现基于任务相关性的专家选择和独立控制的权重贡献，避免赢家通吃的动态。

Result: 在关键基准测试中持续优于基线模型：LIBERO上提升1.8%，RoboTwin上提升9.3%，真实世界实验中实现21.5%的显著改进，验证了其在机器人操作任务中的实际有效性。

Conclusion: 通过协作式专家利用而非专家垄断，AdaMoE在保持计算效率的同时实现了优越性能，证明了协作式专家利用的可行性。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are experiencing rapid development and
demonstrating promising capabilities in robotic manipulation tasks. However,
scaling up VLA models presents several critical challenges: (1) Training new
VLA models from scratch demands substantial computational resources and
extensive datasets. Given the current scarcity of robot data, it becomes
particularly valuable to fully leverage well-pretrained VLA model weights
during the scaling process. (2) Real-time control requires carefully balancing
model capacity with computational efficiency. To address these challenges, We
propose AdaMoE, a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture that inherits
pretrained weights from dense VLA models, and scales up the action expert by
substituting the feedforward layers into sparsely activated MoE layers. AdaMoE
employs a decoupling technique that decouples expert selection from expert
weighting through an independent scale adapter working alongside the
traditional router. This enables experts to be selected based on task relevance
while contributing with independently controlled weights, allowing
collaborative expert utilization rather than winner-takes-all dynamics. Our
approach demonstrates that expertise need not monopolize. Instead, through
collaborative expert utilization, we can achieve superior performance while
maintaining computational efficiency. AdaMoE consistently outperforms the
baseline model across key benchmarks, delivering performance gains of 1.8% on
LIBERO and 9.3% on RoboTwin. Most importantly, a substantial 21.5% improvement
in real-world experiments validates its practical effectiveness for robotic
manipulation tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决四足机器人在未知环境中的鲁棒运动控制问题，传统方法难以适应动态变化的环境条件，需要一种能够在线调整风险偏好的自适应方法。

Method: 使用条件风险价值(CVaR)约束策略优化训练风险条件策略族，部署时通过多臂老虎机框架仅基于观察到的回合回报自适应选择最佳策略，无需特权环境信息。

Result: 在8个未见过的仿真设置和真实机器人实验中，风险感知策略在未知环境中的平均性能和尾部性能比其他基线方法提高近一倍，老虎机自适应能在2分钟内选择出最佳风险感知策略。

Conclusion: 该方法通过风险条件策略训练和在线自适应选择，显著提高了四足机器人在未知环境中的运动鲁棒性和性能，为实际部署提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In this work, we study risk-aware reinforcement learning for quadrupedal
locomotion. Our approach trains a family of risk-conditioned policies using a
Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) constrained policy optimization technique that
provides improved stability and sample efficiency. At deployment, we adaptively
select the best performing policy from the family of policies using a
multi-armed bandit framework that uses only observed episodic returns, without
any privileged environment information, and adapts to unknown conditions on the
fly. Hence, we train quadrupedal locomotion policies at various levels of
robustness using CVaR and adaptively select the desired level of robustness
online to ensure performance in unknown environments. We evaluate our method in
simulation across eight unseen settings (by changing dynamics, contacts,
sensing noise, and terrain) and on a Unitree Go2 robot in previously unseen
terrains. Our risk-aware policy attains nearly twice the mean and tail
performance in unseen environments compared to other baselines and our
bandit-based adaptation selects the best-performing risk-aware policy in
unknown terrain within two minutes of operation.

Conclusion: SUM-AgriVLN方法通过引入空间记忆机制，有效提升了农业视觉语言导航的性能，达到了该领域的最先进水平。

Abstract: Agricultural robots are emerging as powerful assistants across a wide range
of agricultural tasks, nevertheless, still heavily rely on manual operation or
fixed rail systems for movement. The AgriVLN method and the A2A benchmark
pioneeringly extend Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) to the agricultural
domain, enabling robots to navigate to the target positions following the
natural language instructions. In practical agricultural scenarios, navigation
instructions often repeatedly occur, yet AgriVLN treat each instruction as an
independent episode, overlooking the potential of past experiences to provide
spatial context for subsequent ones. To bridge this gap, we propose the method
of Spatial Understanding Memory for Agricultural Vision-and-Language Navigation
(SUM-AgriVLN), in which the SUM module employs spatial understanding and save
spatial memory through 3D reconstruction and representation. When evaluated on
the A2A benchmark, our SUM-AgriVLN effectively improves Success Rate from 0.47
to 0.54 with slight sacrifice on Navigation Error from 2.91m to 2.93m,
demonstrating the state-of-the-art performance in the agricultural domain.

Result: 原型质量为1.92kg，尺寸261x107x420mm，能够以95%的准确度实现自然最大背屈角度，产生的扭矩比自然行走所需高57%，功率生成能力比自然步态周期功率高10%。

Conclusion: RoboANKLE成功实现了自然踝关节运动的模拟，在扭矩和功率输出方面优于自然需求，验证了设计的功能性和有效性。

Abstract: This study presents a powered transtibial prosthesis with complete push-off
assistance, RoboANKLE. The design aims to fulfill specific requirements, such
as a sufficient range of motion (RoM) while providing the necessary torque for
achieving natural ankle motion in daily activities. Addressing the challenges
faced in designing active transtibial prostheses, such as maintaining energetic
autonomy and minimizing weight, is vital for the study. With this aim, we try
to imitate the human ankle by providing extensive push-off assistance to
achieve a natural-like torque profile. Thus, Energy Store and Extended Release
mechanism (ESER) is employed with a novel Extra Energy Storage (EES) mechanism.
Kinematic and kinetic analyses are carried out to determine the design
parameters and assess the design performance. Subsequently, a Computer-Aided
Design (CAD) model is built and used in comprehensive dynamic and structural
analyses. These analyses are used for the design performance evaluation and
determine the forces and torques applied to the prosthesis, which aids in
optimizing the design for minimal weight via structural analysis and topology
optimization. The design of the prototype is then finalized and manufactured
for experimental evaluation to validate the design and functionality. The
prototype is realized with a mass of 1.92 kg and dimensions of 261x107x420 mm.
The Functional evaluations of the RoboANKLE revealed that it is capable of
achieving the natural maximum dorsi-flexion angle with 95% accuracy. Also,
Thanks to the implemented mechanisms, the results show that RoboANKLE can
generate 57% higher than the required torque for natural walking. The result of
the power generation capacity of the RoboANKLE is 10% more than the natural
power during the gait cycle.

Motivation: 解决现有运动先验方法在适应性和模仿精度之间的权衡问题，现有方法要么牺牲模仿精度实现良好适应性，要么需要大量训练数据和测试时目标运动。

Method: 首先将单一参考运动稀疏化为关键帧并进行轻量编辑创建增强数据集，然后通过跟踪稀疏关键帧初始化策略生成密集中间运动，最后训练适配器调整跟踪速度和细化低级动作。

Conclusion: AdaMimic成功结合了运动先验和运动跟踪方法的优势，实现了从单一参考运动的高精度模仿和良好适应性。

Abstract: Humanoid robots are envisioned to adapt demonstrated motions to diverse
real-world conditions while accurately preserving motion patterns. Existing
motion prior approaches enable well adaptability with a few motions but often
sacrifice imitation accuracy, whereas motion-tracking methods achieve accurate
imitation yet require many training motions and a test-time target motion to
adapt. To combine their strengths, we introduce AdaMimic, a novel motion
tracking algorithm that enables adaptable humanoid control from a single
reference motion. To reduce data dependence while ensuring adaptability, our
method first creates an augmented dataset by sparsifying the single reference
motion into keyframes and applying light editing with minimal physical
assumptions. A policy is then initialized by tracking these sparse keyframes to
generate dense intermediate motions, and adapters are subsequently trained to
adjust tracking speed and refine low-level actions based on the adjustment,
enabling flexible time warping that further improves imitation accuracy and
adaptability. We validate these significant improvements in our approach in
both simulation and the real-world Unitree G1 humanoid robot in multiple tasks
across a wide range of adaptation conditions. Videos and code are available at

Conclusion: 该框架对含噪声的离线演示数据具有实际适用性，能有效处理不完美的专家演示。

Abstract: Imitation learning (IL) aims to learn a policy from expert demonstrations and
has been applied to various applications. By learning from the expert policy,
IL methods do not require environmental interactions or reward signals.
However, most existing imitation learning algorithms assume perfect expert
demonstrations, but expert demonstrations often contain imperfections caused by
errors from human experts or sensor/control system inaccuracies. To address the
above problems, this work proposes a filter-and-restore framework to best
leverage expert demonstrations with inherent noise. Our proposed method first
filters clean samples from the demonstrations and then learns conditional
diffusion models to recover the noisy ones. We evaluate our proposed framework
and existing methods in various domains, including robot arm manipulation,
dexterous manipulation, and locomotion. The experiment results show that our
proposed framework consistently outperforms existing methods across all the
tasks. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of each component
and demonstrate the framework's robustness to different noise types and levels.
These results confirm the practical applicability of our framework to noisy
offline demonstration data.

Conclusion: 提出的稳定性标准可推广到广泛的机器人介导交互场景，为设计稳定的远程人-人系统提供指导，并指出了有效时延补偿策略的前提条件。

Abstract: This paper establishes analytical stability criteria for robot-mediated
human-human (dyadic) interaction systems, focusing on haptic communication
under network-induced time delays. Through frequency-domain analysis supported
by numerical simulations, we identify both delay-independent and
delay-dependent stability criteria. The delay-independent criterion guarantees
stability irrespective of the delay, whereas the delay-dependent criterion is
characterised by a maximum tolerable delay before instability occurs. The
criteria demonstrate dependence on controller and robot dynamic parameters,
where increasing stiffness reduces the maximum tolerable delay in a non-linear
manner, thereby heightening system vulnerability. The proposed criteria can be
generalised to a wide range of robot-mediated interactions and serve as design
guidelines for stable remote dyadic systems. Experiments with robots performing
human-like movements further illustrate the correlation between stability and
motor performance. The findings of this paper suggest the prerequisites for
effective delay-compensation strategies.

Abstract: Embeddings from Visual-Language Models are increasingly utilized to represent
semantics in robotic maps, offering an open-vocabulary scene understanding that
surpasses traditional, limited labels. Embeddings enable on-demand querying by
comparing embedded user text prompts to map embeddings via a similarity metric.
The key challenge in performing the task indicated in a query is that the robot
must determine the parts of the environment relevant to the query.
  This paper proposes a solution to this challenge. We leverage
natural-language synonyms and antonyms associated with the query within the
embedding space, applying heuristics to estimate the language space relevant to
the query, and use that to train a classifier to partition the environment into
matches and non-matches. We evaluate our method through extensive experiments,
querying both maps and standard image benchmarks. The results demonstrate
increased queryability of maps and images. Our querying technique is agnostic
to the representation and encoder used, and requires limited training.

Conclusion: 该方法实现了无模型统一抓取-放置推理，能够处理未知物体和真实感知噪声，在非平面支撑场景下表现优于现有方法

Abstract: To reliably pick and place unknown objects under real-world sensing noise
remains a challenging task, as existing methods rely on strong object priors
(e.g., CAD models), or planar-support assumptions, limiting generalization and
unified reasoning between grasping and placing. In this work, we introduce a
generalized placeability metric that evaluates placement poses directly from
noisy point clouds, without any shape priors. The metric jointly scores
stability, graspability, and clearance. From raw geometry, we extract the
support surfaces of the object to generate diverse candidates for
multi-orientation placement and sample contacts that satisfy collision and
stability constraints. By conditioning grasp scores on each candidate
placement, our proposed method enables model-free unified pick-and-place
reasoning and selects grasp-place pairs that lead to stable, collision-free
placements. On unseen real objects and non-planar object supports, our metric
delivers CAD-comparable accuracy in predicting stability loss and generally
produces more physically plausible placements than learning-based predictors.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for representing proprioceptive
time-series data from quadruped robots as structured two-dimensional images,
enabling the use of convolutional neural networks for learning
locomotion-related tasks. The proposed method encodes temporal dynamics from
multiple proprioceptive signals, such as joint positions, IMU readings, and
foot velocities, while preserving the robot's morphological structure in the
spatial arrangement of the image. This transformation captures inter-signal
correlations and gait-dependent patterns, providing a richer feature space than
direct time-series processing. We apply this concept in the problem of contact
estimation, a key capability for stable and adaptive locomotion on diverse
terrains. Experimental evaluations on both real-world datasets and simulated
environments show that our image-based representation consistently enhances
prediction accuracy and generalization over conventional sequence-based models,
underscoring the potential of cross-modal encoding strategies for robotic state
learning. Our method achieves superior performance on the contact dataset,
improving contact state accuracy from 87.7% to 94.5% over the recently proposed
MI-HGNN method, using a 15 times shorter window size.

Conclusion: CAMPD方法能够有效适应多样化场景而无需重新训练，展示了在机器人运动规划中的良好泛化能力和效率

Abstract: Classical methods in robot motion planning, such as sampling-based and
optimization-based methods, often struggle with scalability towards
higher-dimensional state spaces and complex environments. Diffusion models,
known for their capability to learn complex, high-dimensional and multi-modal
data distributions, provide a promising alternative when applied to motion
planning problems and have already shown interesting results. However, most of
the current approaches train their model for a single environment, limiting
their generalization to environments not seen during training. The techniques
that do train a model for multiple environments rely on a specific camera to
provide the model with the necessary environmental information and therefore
always require that sensor. To effectively adapt to diverse scenarios without
the need for retraining, this research proposes Context-Aware Motion Planning
Diffusion (CAMPD). CAMPD leverages a classifier-free denoising probabilistic
diffusion model, conditioned on sensor-agnostic contextual information. An
attention mechanism, integrated in the well-known U-Net architecture,
conditions the model on an arbitrary number of contextual parameters. CAMPD is
evaluated on a 7-DoF robot manipulator and benchmarked against state-of-the-art
approaches on real-world tasks, showing its ability to generalize to unseen
environments and generate high-quality, multi-modal trajectories, at a fraction
of the time required by existing methods.

Conclusion: GOPLA框架通过层次化方法有效解决了物体摆放中的语义和几何推理挑战，利用增强演示和数据扩展技术显著提升了摆放性能。

Abstract: Robots are expected to serve as intelligent assistants, helping humans with
everyday household organization. A central challenge in this setting is the
task of object placement, which requires reasoning about both semantic
preferences (e.g., common-sense object relations) and geometric feasibility
(e.g., collision avoidance). We present GOPLA, a hierarchical framework that
learns generalizable object placement from augmented human demonstrations. A
multi-modal large language model translates human instructions and visual
inputs into structured plans that specify pairwise object relationships. These
plans are then converted into 3D affordance maps with geometric common sense by
a spatial mapper, while a diffusion-based planner generates placement poses
guided by test-time costs, considering multi-plan distributions and collision
avoidance. To overcome data scarcity, we introduce a scalable pipeline that
expands human placement demonstrations into diverse synthetic training data.
Extensive experiments show that our approach improves placement success rates
by 30.04 percentage points over the runner-up, evaluated on positioning
accuracy and physical plausibility, demonstrating strong generalization across
a wide range of real-world robotic placement scenarios.

this approach to real-world contact-rich loco-manipulation with a quadruped

improves sample efficiency, reduces planning horizon requirements, and
generalizes robustly across task variations.

Result: 在USB-C插拔、灯泡安装和卡片滑动等任务中，SaTA显著优于基线方法，成功率提高30%，任务完成时间减少27%

Conclusion: 空间锚定的触觉表示能够实现精确的几何推理，为灵巧操作提供了有效的学习框架

Abstract: Dexterous manipulation requires precise geometric reasoning, yet existing
visuo-tactile learning methods struggle with sub-millimeter precision tasks
that are routine for traditional model-based approaches. We identify a key
limitation: while tactile sensors provide rich contact information, current
learning frameworks fail to effectively leverage both the perceptual richness
of tactile signals and their spatial relationship with hand kinematics. We
believe an ideal tactile representation should explicitly ground contact
measurements in a stable reference frame while preserving detailed sensory
information, enabling policies to not only detect contact occurrence but also
precisely infer object geometry in the hand's coordinate system. We introduce
SaTA (Spatially-anchored Tactile Awareness for dexterous manipulation), an
end-to-end policy framework that explicitly anchors tactile features to the
hand's kinematic frame through forward kinematics, enabling accurate geometric
reasoning without requiring object models or explicit pose estimation. Our key
insight is that spatially grounded tactile representations allow policies to
not only detect contact occurrence but also precisely infer object geometry in
the hand's coordinate system. We validate SaTA on challenging dexterous
manipulation tasks, including bimanual USB-C mating in free space, a task
demanding sub-millimeter alignment precision, as well as light bulb
installation requiring precise thread engagement and rotational control, and
card sliding that demands delicate force modulation and angular precision.
These tasks represent significant challenges for learning-based methods due to
their stringent precision requirements. Across multiple benchmarks, SaTA
significantly outperforms strong visuo-tactile baselines, improving success
rates by up to 30 percentage while reducing task completion times by 27
percentage.

*Steffen Hagedorn,Luka Donkov,Aron Distelzweig,Alexandru P. Condurache*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 该论文通过将先进的智能交通代理模型SMART集成到nuPlan中，首次在更真实条件下评估规划器，并量化了缩小模拟与现实差距时结论的变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于规则的交通代理（如IDM）行为简单被动，会隐藏规划器缺陷并产生评估偏差，无法测试复杂的交互能力。

Method: 将最先进的学习型交通代理模型SMART集成到nuPlan仿真平台中，替代传统的IDM代理。

Result: 基于IDM的仿真高估了规划性能：几乎所有分数都恶化。但在多车道、交互密集场景中，许多规划器表现优于预期。闭环训练的方法表现最佳且最稳定。

Conclusion: 建议将SMART反应式仿真作为nuPlan的新标准闭环基准测试，并发布了SMART代理作为IDM的直接替代方案。

Abstract: Planner evaluation in closed-loop simulation often uses rule-based traffic
agents, whose simplistic and passive behavior can hide planner deficiencies and
bias rankings. Widely used IDM agents simply follow a lead vehicle and cannot
react to vehicles in adjacent lanes, hindering tests of complex interaction
capabilities. We address this issue by integrating the state-of-the-art learned
traffic agent model SMART into nuPlan. Thus, we are the first to evaluate
planners under more realistic conditions and quantify how conclusions shift
when narrowing the sim-to-real gap. Our analysis covers 14 recent planners and
established baselines and shows that IDM-based simulation overestimates
planning performance: nearly all scores deteriorate. In contrast, many planners
interact better than previously assumed and even improve in multi-lane,
interaction-heavy scenarios like lane changes or turns. Methods trained in
closed-loop demonstrate the best and most stable driving performance. However,
when reaching their limits in augmented edge-case scenarios, all learned
planners degrade abruptly, whereas rule-based planners maintain reasonable
basic behavior. Based on our results, we suggest SMART-reactive simulation as a
new standard closed-loop benchmark in nuPlan and release the SMART agents as a
drop-in alternative to IDM at https://github.com/shgd95/InteractiveClosedLoop.

TL;DR: 提出了CADRE框架，通过神经描述符场提取接触特征，用于在灵巧操作中捕捉掉落物体并重置系统，提高训练效率和恢复成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界的灵巧操作常遇到意外错误和干扰，可能导致灾难性失败（如掉落物体）。需要解决在抓取范围内捕捉掉落物体并将系统重置到有利于恢复主要操作任务的状态的问题。

Method: 提出了CADRE强化学习框架，包含受神经描述符场启发的模块来提取隐式接触特征。相比仅依赖物体姿态或点云输入的方法，NDF可以直接推理手指-物体对应关系并适应不同物体几何形状。

Result: 实验表明，引入接触特征提高了训练效率，增强了强化学习训练的收敛性能，最终带来更成功的恢复。CADRE能够零样本泛化到具有不同几何形状的未见物体。

Conclusion: CADRE框架通过接触感知的动态恢复方法，有效解决了灵巧操作中的物体掉落问题，具有较好的泛化能力和恢复效果。

Abstract: Real-world dexterous manipulation often encounters unexpected errors and
disturbances, which can lead to catastrophic failures, such as dropping the
manipulated object. To address this challenge, we focus on the problem of
catching a falling object while it remains within grasping range and,
importantly, resetting the system to a configuration favorable for resuming the
primary manipulation task. We propose Contact-Aware Dynamic Recovery (CADRE), a
reinforcement learning framework that incorporates a Neural Descriptor Field
(NDF)-inspired module to extract implicit contact features. Compared to methods
that rely solely on object pose or point cloud input, NDFs can directly reason
about finger-object correspondence and adapt to different object geometries.
Our experiments show that incorporating contact features improves training
efficiency, enhances convergence performance for RL training, and ultimately
leads to more successful recoveries. Additionally, we demonstrate that CADRE
can generalize zero-shot to unseen objects with different geometries.

Motivation: 现有自主无人机竞速系统虽然达到冠军水平，但高度特定于竞速任务。端到端视觉方法虽具更广泛适用性，但尚无系统能同时实现完整模拟到真实转移、机载执行和冠军级性能。

Method: 基于informed Dreamer模型强化学习方法，世界模型解码为训练期间可用的特权信息。世界模型作为隐式状态和参数估计器，通过世界模型隐藏状态解码的状态跟踪进度以解决视觉模糊性，无需外部相机标定。

Result: 在真实实验中实现稳健高速飞行，执行倒置循环、分裂S和梯子等复杂机动，速度达21m/s，加速度达6g。展示非平凡的视觉模拟到真实转移，在低质量分割掩码上运行，并通过准确估计最大可达电机RPM实时调整飞行路径来应对电池耗尽。

Conclusion: SkyDreamer对现实差距的重要方面具有适应性，在实现极高速敏捷飞行的同时保持稳健性。

Abstract: Autonomous drone racing (ADR) systems have recently achieved champion-level
performance, yet remain highly specific to drone racing. While end-to-end
vision-based methods promise broader applicability, no system to date
simultaneously achieves full sim-to-real transfer, onboard execution, and
champion-level performance. In this work, we present SkyDreamer, to the best of
our knowledge, the first end-to-end vision-based ADR policy that maps directly
from pixel-level representations to motor commands. SkyDreamer builds on
informed Dreamer, a model-based reinforcement learning approach where the world
model decodes to privileged information only available during training. By
extending this concept to end-to-end vision-based ADR, the world model
effectively functions as an implicit state and parameter estimator, greatly
improving interpretability. SkyDreamer runs fully onboard without external aid,
resolves visual ambiguities by tracking progress using the state decoded from
the world model's hidden state, and requires no extrinsic camera calibration,
enabling rapid deployment across different drones without retraining.
Real-world experiments show that SkyDreamer achieves robust, high-speed flight,
executing tight maneuvers such as an inverted loop, a split-S and a ladder,
reaching speeds of up to 21 m/s and accelerations of up to 6 g. It further
demonstrates a non-trivial visual sim-to-real transfer by operating on
poor-quality segmentation masks, and exhibits robustness to battery depletion
by accurately estimating the maximum attainable motor RPM and adjusting its
flight path in real-time. These results highlight SkyDreamer's adaptability to
important aspects of the reality gap, bringing robustness while still achieving
extremely high-speed, agile flight.

Motivation: 在复杂人类环境中实现安全高效的机器人操作需要良好的特定场地运动模式模型，现有动态地图方法使用离散空间采样且需要昂贵的离线构建。

Method: 使用隐式神经函数构建连续时空动态地图表示，直接将坐标映射到半包裹高斯混合模型参数，避免离散化和不均匀采样区域的插补问题。

Conclusion: 该方法为建模复杂人类运动模式提供了一种强大而高效的方式。

Abstract: Safe and efficient robot operation in complex human environments can benefit
from good models of site-specific motion patterns. Maps of Dynamics (MoDs)
provide such models by encoding statistical motion patterns in a map, but
existing representations use discrete spatial sampling and typically require
costly offline construction. We propose a continuous spatio-temporal MoD
representation based on implicit neural functions that directly map coordinates
to the parameters of a Semi-Wrapped Gaussian Mixture Model. This removes the
need for discretization and imputation for unevenly sampled regions, enabling
smooth generalization across both space and time. Evaluated on a large public
dataset with long-term real-world people tracking data, our method achieves
better accuracy of motion representation and smoother velocity distributions in
sparse regions while still being computationally efficient, compared to
available baselines. The proposed approach demonstrates a powerful and
efficient way of modeling complex human motion patterns.

Abstract: Real-world robotic manipulation in homes and factories demands reliability,
efficiency, and robustness that approach or surpass skilled human operators. We
present RL-100, a real-world reinforcement learning training framework built on
diffusion visuomotor policies trained bu supervised learning. RL-100 introduces
a three-stage pipeline. First, imitation learning leverages human priors.
Second, iterative offline reinforcement learning uses an Offline Policy
Evaluation procedure, abbreviated OPE, to gate PPO-style updates that are
applied in the denoising process for conservative and reliable improvement.
Third, online reinforcement learning eliminates residual failure modes. An
additional lightweight consistency distillation head compresses the multi-step
sampling process in diffusion into a single-step policy, enabling
high-frequency control with an order-of-magnitude reduction in latency while
preserving task performance. The framework is task-, embodiment-, and
representation-agnostic and supports both 3D point clouds and 2D RGB inputs, a
variety of robot platforms, and both single-step and action-chunk policies. We
evaluate RL-100 on seven real-robot tasks spanning dynamic rigid-body control,
such as Push-T and Agile Bowling, fluids and granular pouring, deformable cloth
folding, precise dexterous unscrewing, and multi-stage orange juicing. RL-100
attains 100\% success across evaluated trials for a total of 900 out of 900
episodes, including up to 250 out of 250 consecutive trials on one task. The
method achieves near-human teleoperation or better time efficiency and
demonstrates multi-hour robustness with uninterrupted operation lasting up to
two hours.

strategy for acoustic-based target localization. Two scenarios are considered:
single source localization, in which the agents are driven maintaining a rigid
formation towards the target, and multi-source scenario, in which each agent
searches for the targets independently from the others.

Abstract: We present Sadcher, a real-time task assignment framework for heterogeneous
multi-robot teams that incorporates dynamic coalition formation and task
precedence constraints. Sadcher is trained through Imitation Learning and
combines graph attention and transformers to predict assignment rewards between
robots and tasks. Based on the predicted rewards, a relaxed bipartite matching
step generates high-quality schedules with feasibility guarantees. We
explicitly model robot and task positions, task durations, and robots'
remaining processing times, enabling advanced temporal and spatial reasoning
and generalization to environments with different spatiotemporal distributions
compared to training. Trained on optimally solved small-scale instances, our
method can scale to larger task sets and team sizes. Sadcher outperforms other
learning-based and heuristic baselines on randomized, unseen problems for small
and medium-sized teams with computation times suitable for real-time operation.
We also explore sampling-based variants and evaluate scalability across robot

Abstract: Autonomous high-speed navigation through large, complex environments requires
real-time generation of agile trajectories that are dynamically feasible,
collision-free, and satisfy state or actuator constraints. Modern trajectory
planning techniques primarily use numerical optimization, as they enable the
systematic computation of high-quality, expressive trajectories that satisfy
various constraints. However, stringent requirements on computation time and
the risk of numerical instability can limit the use of optimization-based
planners in safety-critical scenarios. This work presents an optimization-free
planning framework called STITCHER that stitches short trajectory segments
together with graph search to compute long-range, expressive, and near-optimal
trajectories in real-time. STITCHER outperforms modern optimization-based
planners through our innovative planning architecture and several algorithmic
developments that make real-time planning possible. Extensive simulation
testing is performed to analyze the algorithmic components that make up
STITCHER, along with a thorough comparison with two state-of-the-art
optimization planners. Simulation tests show that safe trajectories can be
created within a few milliseconds for paths that span the entirety of two 50 m
x 50 m environments. Hardware tests with a custom quadrotor verify that
STITCHER can produce trackable paths in real-time while respecting nonconvex
constraints, such as limits on tilt angle and motor forces, which are otherwise
hard to include in optimization-based planners.

Conclusion: VLA^2框架通过集成外部知识源有效缓解了VLA模型处理分布外对象的泛化失败问题，显著提升了模型在未见对象场景下的性能。

Abstract: Current vision-language-action (VLA) models, pre-trained on large-scale
robotic data, exhibit strong multi-task capabilities and generalize well to
variations in visual and language instructions for manipulation. However, their
success rate drops significantly when faced with object concepts outside the
training data, such as unseen object descriptions and textures in the dataset.
To address this, we propose a novel agentic framework, VLA^2, which leverages
OpenVLA as the execution backbone and effectively leverages external modules
such as web retrieval and object detection to provide visual and textual
knowledge about target objects to the VLA. This approach mitigates
generalization failure when handling out-of-distribution objects. Based on the
LIBERO simulation environment, we introduced novel objects and object
descriptions to construct a new evaluation benchmark with three difficulty
levels to test the effectiveness of our method. Our framework successfully
outperformed the current state-of-the-art models on our designed hard-level
generalization benchmark. Compared to the standalone OpenVLA baseline, VLA^2
achieves a 44.2% improvement in the success rate in the hard-level benchmark
and an average improvement of 20.2% in all customized environments without any
performance degradation on in-domain tasks. Project website:

Abstract: Humans excel at bimanual assembly tasks by adapting to rich tactile feedback
-- a capability that remains difficult to replicate in robots through
behavioral cloning alone, due to the suboptimality and limited diversity of
human demonstrations. In this work, we present VT-Refine, a visuo-tactile
policy learning framework that combines real-world demonstrations,
high-fidelity tactile simulation, and reinforcement learning to tackle precise,
contact-rich bimanual assembly. We begin by training a diffusion policy on a
small set of demonstrations using synchronized visual and tactile inputs. This
policy is then transferred to a simulated digital twin equipped with simulated
tactile sensors and further refined via large-scale reinforcement learning to
enhance robustness and generalization. To enable accurate sim-to-real transfer,
we leverage high-resolution piezoresistive tactile sensors that provide normal
force signals and can be realistically modeled in parallel using
GPU-accelerated simulation. Experimental results show that VT-Refine improves
assembly performance in both simulation and the real world by increasing data
diversity and enabling more effective policy fine-tuning. Our project page is

Result: 在Unitree G1人形机器人上，该方法在楼梯和边缘任务中成功，而单阶段感知策略失败；分层策略在仿真和硬件中均优于单阶段替代方案

Conclusion: 时间尺度的架构分离（而非网络规模或复杂性）是实现鲁棒感知条件运动的关键因素

Abstract: Robust humanoid locomotion in unstructured environments requires
architectures that balance fast low-level stabilization with slower perceptual
decision-making. We show that a simple layered control architecture (LCA), a
proprioceptive stabilizer running at high rate, coupled with a compact low-rate
perceptual policy, enables substantially more robust performance than
monolithic end-to-end designs, even when using minimal perception encoders.
Through a two-stage training curriculum (blind stabilizer pretraining followed
by perceptual fine-tuning), we demonstrate that layered policies consistently
outperform one-stage alternatives in both simulation and hardware. On a Unitree
G1 humanoid, our approach succeeds across stair and ledge tasks where one-stage
perceptual policies fail. These results highlight that architectural separation
of timescales, rather than network scale or complexity, is the key enabler for
robust perception-conditioned locomotion.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语言引导的人形机器人运动流程采用多阶段处理（运动解码、重定向、物理控制），存在累积误差、高延迟和语义与控制弱耦合的问题，需要更直接的语言到动作路径。

Method: 采用基于扩散的策略，直接从噪声中反噪出可执行动作，保留语义意图；使用混合因果transformer-diffusion运动生成器确保长期一致性，同时保持稳定性和多样性。

Result: 实验表明RoboGhost显著减少部署延迟，提高成功率和跟踪精度，在真人形机器人上产生平滑、语义对齐的运动。

Conclusion: 该框架为视觉-语言-动作人形系统提供了通用基础，可自然扩展到图像、音频、音乐等其他模态。

Abstract: Natural language offers a natural interface for humanoid robots, but existing
language-guided humanoid locomotion pipelines remain cumbersome and unreliable.
They typically decode human motion, retarget it to robot morphology, and then
track it with a physics-based controller. However, this multi-stage process is
prone to cumulative errors, introduces high latency, and yields weak coupling
between semantics and control. These limitations call for a more direct pathway
from language to action, one that eliminates fragile intermediate stages.
Therefore, we present RoboGhost, a retargeting-free framework that directly
conditions humanoid policies on language-grounded motion latents. By bypassing
explicit motion decoding and retargeting, RoboGhost enables a diffusion-based
policy to denoise executable actions directly from noise, preserving semantic
intent and supporting fast, reactive control. A hybrid causal
transformer-diffusion motion generator further ensures long-horizon consistency
while maintaining stability and diversity, yielding rich latent representations
for precise humanoid behavior. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RoboGhost
substantially reduces deployment latency, improves success rates and tracking
accuracy, and produces smooth, semantically aligned locomotion on real
humanoids. Beyond text, the framework naturally extends to other modalities
such as images, audio, and music, providing a general foundation for
vision-language-action humanoid systems.

*Lizhi Yang,Blake Werner,Massimiliano de Sa Aaron D. Ames*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: CBF-RL框架通过在训练中强制执行控制屏障函数(CBFs)来生成安全的强化学习行为，无需在线安全过滤器即可实现安全部署。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习(RL)通常以牺牲安全性为代价来优先考虑性能，而安全性违规可能导致灾难性后果。虽然控制屏障函数(CBFs)提供了强制执行动态安全性的原则性方法，但RL策略不了解CBF会导致保守行为。

Method: CBF-RL框架有两个关键属性：(1)通过CBF项最小化修改名义RL策略以编码安全约束；(2)在训练中对策略rollouts进行安全过滤。理论上证明了连续时间安全过滤器可以通过闭式表达式在离散时间rollouts上部署。

Result: CBF-RL将安全约束内化到学习策略中——既强制执行更安全的动作，又偏向更安全的奖励——无需在线安全过滤器即可实现安全部署。在导航任务和Unitree G1人形机器人上的消融研究表明，CBF-RL实现了更安全的探索、更快的收敛和不确定下的鲁棒性能。

Conclusion: CBF-RL框架通过将CBFs整合到训练过程中，使强化学习策略内化安全约束，无需运行时安全过滤器即可在真实世界环境中安全部署，如人形机器人避障和爬楼梯任务。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL), while powerful and expressive, can often
prioritize performance at the expense of safety. Yet safety violations can lead
to catastrophic outcomes in real-world deployments. Control Barrier Functions
(CBFs) offer a principled method to enforce dynamic safety -- traditionally
deployed \emph{online} via safety filters. While the result is safe behavior,
the fact that the RL policy does not have knowledge of the CBF can lead to
conservative behaviors. This paper proposes CBF-RL, a framework for generating
safe behaviors with RL by enforcing CBFs \emph{in training}. CBF-RL has two key
attributes: (1) minimally modifying a nominal RL policy to encode safety
constraints via a CBF term, (2) and safety filtering of the policy rollouts in
training. Theoretically, we prove that continuous-time safety filters can be
deployed via closed-form expressions on discrete-time roll-outs. Practically,
we demonstrate that CBF-RL internalizes the safety constraints in the learned
policy -- both enforcing safer actions and biasing towards safer rewards --
enabling safe deployment without the need for an online safety filter. We
validate our framework through ablation studies on navigation tasks and on the
Unitree G1 humanoid robot, where CBF-RL enables safer exploration, faster
convergence, and robust performance under uncertainty, enabling the humanoid
robot to avoid obstacles and climb stairs safely in real-world settings without
a runtime safety filter.

*Mingxuan Yan,Yuping Wang,Zechun Liu,Jiachen Li*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出基于检索的演示分解器(RDD)，通过将分解后的子任务视觉特征与低层视觉运动策略训练数据对齐，自动将演示分解为子任务，提升长时程任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分层VLA框架中，VLM规划器需要人工标注或启发式规则来分解任务演示，但启发式子任务可能与视觉运动策略训练数据不匹配，导致性能下降。

Method: RDD通过检索视觉特征相似性，自动将演示分解为与低层视觉运动策略训练数据对齐的子任务，无需人工标注。

Result: 在仿真和真实世界任务中均优于最先进的子任务分解器，在不同设置下表现出鲁棒性。

Conclusion: RDD提供了一种自动化的演示分解方法，通过视觉特征对齐解决了子任务与策略训练数据不匹配的问题，显著提升了分层VLA框架的性能。

Abstract: To tackle long-horizon tasks, recent hierarchical vision-language-action
(VLAs) frameworks employ vision-language model (VLM)-based planners to
decompose complex manipulation tasks into simpler sub-tasks that low-level
visuomotor policies can easily handle. Typically, the VLM planner is finetuned
to learn to decompose a target task. This finetuning requires target task
demonstrations segmented into sub-tasks by either human annotation or heuristic
rules. However, the heuristic subtasks can deviate significantly from the
training data of the visuomotor policy, which degrades task performance. To
address these issues, we propose a Retrieval-based Demonstration Decomposer
(RDD) that automatically decomposes demonstrations into sub-tasks by aligning
the visual features of the decomposed sub-task intervals with those from the
training data of the low-level visuomotor policies. Our method outperforms the
state-of-the-art sub-task decomposer on both simulation and real-world tasks,
demonstrating robustness across diverse settings. Code and more results are
available at rdd-neurips.github.io.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于语义推理的物联网设备识别方法，将设备识别重新定义为异构网络元数据的语言建模任务，使用指令调优的LLaMA3.18B模型在真实世界IoT流量数据集上实现了高精度识别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 物联网设备的快速扩张超出了当前识别方法的能力，给安全、隐私和网络问责带来了重大风险，特别是在元数据不完整、有噪声或被故意混淆的开放世界环境中。

Method: 构建语义推理管道，将设备识别重新定义为语言建模任务；使用基于互信息和熵的稳定性评分引导的LLM集成方法为IoT Inspector数据集生成高质量供应商标签；采用课程学习对量化的LLaMA3.18B模型进行指令调优。

Result: 模型在2,015个供应商上实现了98.25%的top-1准确率和90.73%的宏观准确率，同时对缺失字段、协议漂移和对抗性操作保持鲁棒性。在独立IoT测试平台上的评估验证了方法的可扩展性和可解释性。

Conclusion: 指令调优的大型语言模型为大规模真实世界设备识别提供了可扩展且可解释的基础，能够有效应对开放世界环境中的挑战。

Abstract: The rapid expansion of IoT devices has outpaced current identification
methods, creating significant risks for security, privacy, and network
accountability. These challenges are heightened in open-world environments,
where traffic metadata is often incomplete, noisy, or intentionally obfuscated.
We introduce a semantic inference pipeline that reframes device identification
as a language modeling task over heterogeneous network metadata. To construct
reliable supervision, we generate high-fidelity vendor labels for the IoT
Inspector dataset, the largest real-world IoT traffic corpus, using an ensemble
of large language models guided by mutual-information and entropy-based
stability scores. We then instruction-tune a quantized LLaMA3.18B model with
curriculum learning to support generalization under sparsity and long-tail
vendor distributions. Our model achieves 98.25% top-1 accuracy and 90.73% macro
accuracy across 2,015 vendors while maintaining resilience to missing fields,
protocol drift, and adversarial manipulation. Evaluation on an independent IoT
testbed, coupled with explanation quality and adversarial stress tests,
demonstrates that instruction-tuned LLMs provide a scalable and interpretable
foundation for real-world device identification at scale.

*Zixi Wang,Yushe Cao,Yubo Huang,Jinzhu Wei,Jingzehua Xu,Shuai Zhang,Xin Lai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为STDW的自训练动态加权方法，通过动态平衡源域和目标域的损失贡献来增强渐进域适应的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统渐进域适应方法在通过中间域和自训练缓解域偏移时，常面临知识迁移效率低或中间数据不完整的问题。

Method: 引入动态加权机制，使用时变超参数ϱ控制域特定学习的强度，结合自训练生成伪标签并优化加权目标函数进行迭代模型更新。

Result: 在旋转MNIST、颜色偏移MNIST、肖像数据集和Cover Type数据集上的实验表明，STDW优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: 该工作为鲁棒的渐进域适应提供了理论见解和实用框架，在动态现实场景中具有应用潜力。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new method called Self-Training with Dynamic
Weighting (STDW), which aims to enhance robustness in Gradual Domain Adaptation
(GDA) by addressing the challenge of smooth knowledge migration from the source
to the target domain. Traditional GDA methods mitigate domain shift through
intermediate domains and self-training but often suffer from inefficient
knowledge migration or incomplete intermediate data. Our approach introduces a
dynamic weighting mechanism that adaptively balances the loss contributions of
the source and target domains during training. Specifically, we design an
optimization framework governed by a time-varying hyperparameter $\varrho$
(progressing from 0 to 1), which controls the strength of domain-specific
learning and ensures stable adaptation. The method leverages self-training to
generate pseudo-labels and optimizes a weighted objective function for
iterative model updates, maintaining robustness across intermediate domains.
Experiments on rotated MNIST, color-shifted MNIST, portrait datasets, and the
Cover Type dataset demonstrate that STDW outperforms existing baselines.
Ablation studies further validate the critical role of $\varrho$'s dynamic
scheduling in achieving progressive adaptation, confirming its effectiveness in
reducing domain bias and improving generalization. This work provides both
theoretical insights and a practical framework for robust gradual domain
adaptation, with potential applications in dynamic real-world scenarios. The

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Deep Edge Filter方法，通过对深度神经网络特征进行高通滤波来提升模型泛化能力，假设高频分量包含任务相关语义信息，低频分量包含领域特定偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于假设：神经网络在深度特征的高频分量中编码任务相关语义信息，而在低频分量中存储领域特定偏差，希望通过隔离高频分量来提升模型泛化性。

Method: 从原始特征中减去低通滤波输出，隔离可泛化表示，同时保持架构完整性。

Result: 在视觉、文本、3D和音频等多个领域的实验结果显示，无论模型架构和数据模态如何，都能获得一致的性能提升。

Conclusion: 该方法通过特征稀疏化和有效隔离高频分量，验证了核心假设，为提升模型泛化能力提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce the Deep Edge Filter, a novel approach that applies high-pass
filtering to deep neural network features to improve model generalizability.
Our method is motivated by our hypothesis that neural networks encode
task-relevant semantic information in high-frequency components while storing
domain-specific biases in low-frequency components of deep features. By
subtracting low-pass filtered outputs from original features, our approach
isolates generalizable representations while preserving architectural
integrity. Experimental results across diverse domains such as Vision, Text,
3D, and Audio demonstrate consistent performance improvements regardless of
model architecture and data modality. Analysis reveals that our method induces
feature sparsification and effectively isolates high-frequency components,
providing empirical validation of our core hypothesis. The code is available at

TL;DR: CoLoR-GAN提出了一种用于GAN的持续少样本学习方法，通过低秩适配技术减少参数数量，同时解决灾难性遗忘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最先进的持续学习方法如LFS-GAN在每次训练迭代中引入大量新权重，长期来看参数负担显著。需要一种既能处理少样本学习又能进行持续学习的高效方法。

Method: 使用低秩张量来高效适配模型到目标任务，减少所需参数数量。提出了LoRA in LoRA (LLoRA)技术用于卷积层，进一步优化适配器大小，并提供超参数选择的经验研究。

Result: 在多个基准持续学习和少样本任务上的实验表明，CoLoR-GAN高效且达到最先进性能，同时显著减少资源需求。

Conclusion: CoLoR-GAN框架能够同时处理少样本和持续学习，通过低秩适配技术大幅减少参数数量，在保持高性能的同时显著降低资源消耗。

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) in the context of Generative Adversarial Networks
(GANs) remains a challenging problem, particularly when it comes to learn from
a few-shot (FS) samples without catastrophic forgetting. Current most effective
state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, like LFS-GAN, introduce a non-negligible
quantity of new weights at each training iteration, which would become
significant when considering the long term. For this reason, this paper
introduces \textcolor{red}{\textbf{\underline{c}}}ontinual
few-sh\textcolor{red}{\textbf{\underline{o}}}t learning with
\textcolor{red}{\textbf{\underline{lo}}}w-\textcolor{red}{\textbf{\underline{r}}}ank
adaptation in GANs named CoLoR-GAN, a framework designed to handle both FS and
CL together, leveraging low-rank tensors to efficiently adapt the model to
target tasks while reducing even more the number of parameters required.
Applying a vanilla LoRA implementation already permitted us to obtain pretty
good results. In order to optimize even further the size of the adapters, we
challenged LoRA limits introducing a LoRA in LoRA (LLoRA) technique for
convolutional layers. Finally, aware of the criticality linked to the choice of
the hyperparameters of LoRA, we provide an empirical study to easily find the
best ones. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CoLoR-GAN through experiments on
several benchmark CL and FS tasks and show that our model is efficient,
reaching SOTA performance but with a number of resources enormously reduced.

*Xuwang Yin,Claire Zhang,Julie Steele,Nir Shavit,Tony T. Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合对抗训练的统一框架，同时实现鲁棒分类和高质量生成建模，解决了传统联合能量模型的不稳定性和样本质量问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有混合方法如JEM将分类器解释为能量模型，但受限于SGLD训练的不稳定性和样本质量差的问题，需要更稳定的训练框架来同时实现鲁棒分类和高质量生成。

Method: 采用对抗训练原则，用稳定的AT方法替代SGLD，通过区分真实数据和PGD生成的对比样本来优化能量函数；结合对抗训练增强分类鲁棒性；使用两阶段训练解决批归一化与EBM训练的不兼容问题。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和ImageNet上显著提升对抗鲁棒性，生成质量超越BigGAN并接近扩散模型，是首个在复杂高分辨率数据集上实现高质量生成的MCMC-based EBM方法。

Conclusion: 该方法解决了JEM扩展的关键稳定性问题，证明对抗训练可作为统一框架的有效基础，能够同时生成和鲁棒分类视觉数据。

Abstract: Simultaneously achieving robust classification and high-fidelity generative
modeling within a single framework presents a significant challenge. Hybrid
approaches, such as Joint Energy-Based Models (JEM), interpret classifiers as
EBMs but are often limited by the instability and poor sample quality inherent
in SGLD-based training. We address these limitations by proposing a novel
training framework that integrates adversarial training (AT) principles for
both discriminative robustness and stable generative learning. The proposed
method introduces three key innovations: (1) the replacement of SGLD-based JEM
learning with a stable, AT-based approach that optimizes the energy function by
discriminating between real data and PGD-generated contrastive samples using
the BCE loss; (2) synergistic adversarial training for the discriminative
component that enhances classification robustness while eliminating the need
for explicit gradient penalties; and (3) a two-stage training procedure to
resolve the incompatibility between batch normalization and EBM training.
Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet demonstrate that our method
substantially improves adversarial robustness over existing hybrid models while
maintaining competitive generative performance. On ImageNet, when optimized for
generative modeling, our model's generative fidelity surpasses that of BigGAN
and approaches diffusion models, representing the first MCMC-based EBM approach
to achieve high-quality generation on complex, high-resolution datasets. Our
approach addresses key stability issues that have limited JEM scaling and
demonstrates that adversarial training can serve as an effective foundation for
unified frameworks capable of generating and robustly classifying visual data.

*Yifeng Yao,Yike Yun,Jing Wang,Huishuai Zhang,Dongyan Zhao,Ke Tian,Zhihao Wang,Minghui Qiu,Tao Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: K-frames提出了一种场景驱动的关键帧选择新范式，通过预测语义连贯的查询相关片段来保持时间连续性，支持任意k个关键帧选择以适应不同用户预算。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型在长视频理解中受到上下文窗口和计算成本的限制，均匀帧采样会导致信息丢失，而现有的关键帧选择方法通常产生稀疏且时间不连续的帧，忽略了场景连续性。

Method: 首先构建了PeakClips数据集，包含20万个基于查询的视频高光片段。然后采用三阶段渐进式课程学习：两个监督微调阶段用于时间定位和关键片段感知，接着是强化学习阶段直接优化场景驱动预测策略。

Result: 在主要的长视频理解基准测试上的广泛实验表明，K-frames提供了一个有效、可解释且即插即用的解决方案，可在不同尺度上进行关键帧选择。

Conclusion: K-frames通过场景驱动的关键帧选择方法，解决了长视频理解中的关键帧稀疏和时间不连续问题，提供了一种灵活的多尺度帧选择方案。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant
capabilities in image understanding, but long-video are constrained by context
windows and computational cost. Uniform frame sampling often leads to
substantial information loss. Meanwhile existing keyframe selection methods
such as text-frame retrieval or RL-based frame optimization typically yield
sparse and temporally disjointed frames, overlooking scene continuity and
lacking flexibility for multi-scale frame selection. To address these
limitations, we introduce K-frames, a novel paradigm for scene-driven keyframe
selection that preserves temporal continuity. Instead of selecting individual
frames, K-frames predicts semantically coherent, query-relevant clips, which
enables any-k keyframes selection to meet diverse user budgets. To achieve this
approach, we first introduce PeakClips, a dataset of 200K video highlights
conditioned by query. Building on this dataset, K-frames learns clip2frame
selection using a three-stage progressive curriculum. It involves two
Supervised Fine-Tuning stages for temporal grounding and key-clip perception,
followed by a Reinforcement Learning stage that directly optimizes the
scene-driven prediction policy for downstream task without further annotations.
Extensive experiments on major long-video understanding benchmarks demonstrate
that K-frames provides an effective, interpretable, and plug-and-play solution
for keyframe selection at various scales. Our dataset and model will be
available.

TL;DR: 提出了一种多视图半监督标签分布学习方法MVSS-LDL，通过利用每个视图的局部最近邻结构并强调多视图间局部结构的互补性来解决多视图半监督标签分布学习问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的标签分布学习方法主要针对单视图和全监督场景，而多视图场景下同时包含标记和未标记数据的标签分布学习问题尚未被考虑。

Method: 首先计算每个视图的k-最近邻，然后通过整合其他视图的最近邻信息来补充每个视图的最近邻集合，最后基于补充后的最近邻集合构建基于图学习的多视图半监督标签分布学习模型。

Result: 数值研究表明，MVSS-LDL在分类性能上明显优于现有的单视图标签分布学习方法。

Conclusion: 这是首次尝试解决多视图标签分布学习问题，通过考虑局部最近邻结构的互补性，不同视图可以相互提供局部结构信息来补充彼此。

Abstract: Label distribution learning (LDL) is a paradigm that each sample is
associated with a label distribution. At present, the existing approaches are
proposed for the single-view LDL problem with labeled data, while the
multi-view LDL problem with labeled and unlabeled data has not been considered.
In this paper, we put forward the multi-view semi-supervised label distribution
learning with local structure complementarity (MVSS-LDL) approach, which
exploits the local nearest neighbor structure of each view and emphasizes the
complementarity of local nearest neighbor structures in multiple views.
Specifically speaking, we first explore the local structure of view $v$ by
computing the $k$-nearest neighbors. As a result, the $k$-nearest neighbor set
of each sample $\boldsymbol{x}_i$ in view $v$ is attained. Nevertheless, this
$k$-nearest neighbor set describes only a part of the nearest neighbor
information of sample $\boldsymbol{x}_i$. In order to obtain a more
comprehensive description of sample $\boldsymbol{x}_i$'s nearest neighbors, we
complement the nearest neighbor set in view $v$ by incorporating sample
$\boldsymbol{x}_i$'s nearest neighbors in other views. Lastly, based on the
complemented nearest neighbor set in each view, a graph learning-based
multi-view semi-supervised LDL model is constructed. By considering the
complementarity of local nearest neighbor structures, different views can
mutually provide the local structural information to complement each other. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt at multi-view LDL.
Numerical studies have demonstrated that MVSS-LDL attains explicitly better
classification performance than the existing single-view LDL methods.

TL;DR: 提出Weight Weaving方法，通过用户定义的池化函数在λ值搜索空间中合并模型权重，无需评估数据即可改进模型融合性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型融合方法严重依赖缩放超参数λ，但缺乏无需数据的原则性设置方法，研究人员通常使用评估数据调优λ，这在实践中不可行

Method: Weight Weaving技术，使用平均、随机选择或现有模型融合方法等池化函数在λ搜索空间中合并模型权重，具有高模块性和正交性

Result: 在三个ViT变体和三个实验设置中验证，平均准确率提升高达15.9个百分点，无需数据即可持续改进多个模型融合方法

Conclusion: Weight Weaving是一种即插即用的数据无关模型融合技术，消除了评估数据需求，显著提升模型融合性能

Abstract: Model merging provides a cost-effective and data-efficient combination of
specialized deep neural networks through parameter integration. This technique
leverages expert models across downstream tasks without requiring retraining.
Most model merging approaches critically depend on scaling hyper-parameters
$\lambda$, which weight each model's contribution globally or individually.
Principled approaches for setting scaling factors without accessing any data
(data-free) are scarce, often leading researchers to tune $\lambda$ using
privileged data from the evaluation set, which is obviously unfeasible in
practice. To address this limitation, we introduce Weight Weaving, a
plug-and-play technique that pools model weights across $\lambda$ values search
space using user-defined pooling functions, such as averaging, random
selection, or even existing model merging methods. Our method demonstrates high
modularity, imposing minimal constraints on the search space. It operates
orthogonally to existing model merging methods and eliminates evaluation data
requirements. We validate Weight Weaving across three ViT variants in three
experimental setups: vision multi-task learning, vision continual learning, and
domain generalization. Our method consistently improves the performance of
several model merging methods, achieving average accuracy gains of up to 15.9
percentage points in a data-free setting.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新的方法，将ICD编码分配任务视为分类和排序问题，而不是传统的纯分类任务，以考虑编码顺序的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床笔记中的ICD编码顺序对医疗诊断和报销至关重要，但现有方法将其视为分类任务而忽略了编码顺序。

Method: 从检索系统角度处理该任务，将其制定为分类和排序任务，同时考虑编码分配和优先级排序。

Result: 模型在正确排序主要诊断编码方面的准确率达到47%，优于现有最佳分类器的20%；在分类指标上，微平均和宏平均F1分数分别为0.6065和0.2904，超过之前最佳模型的0.597和0.2660。

Conclusion: 提出的框架在识别高优先级编码方面具有卓越能力，证明了考虑编码顺序的重要性。

Abstract: Clinical notes contain unstructured text provided by clinicians during
patient encounters. These notes are usually accompanied by a sequence of
diagnostic codes following the International Classification of Diseases (ICD).
Correctly assigning and ordering ICD codes are essential for medical diagnosis
and reimbursement. However, automating this task remains challenging.
State-of-the-art methods treated this problem as a classification task, leading
to ignoring the order of ICD codes that is essential for different purposes. In
this work, as a first attempt, we approach this task from a retrieval system
perspective to consider the order of codes, thus formulating this problem as a
classification and ranking task. Our results and analysis show that the
proposed framework has a superior ability to identify high-priority codes
compared to other methods. For instance, our model accuracy in correctly
ranking primary diagnosis codes is 47%, compared to 20% for the
state-of-the-art classifier. Additionally, in terms of classification metrics,
the proposed model achieves a micro- and macro-F1 scores of 0.6065 and 0.2904,
respectively, surpassing the previous best model with scores of 0.597 and
0.2660.

### [147] [Distributional Consistency Loss: Beyond Pointwise Data Terms in Inverse Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13972)
*George Webber,Andrew J. Reader*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的数据保真度损失函数——分布一致性损失，用于逆问题中的信号恢复。该损失通过测试观测测量值是否与当前估计所隐含的噪声分布在统计上一致，来替代传统的逐点匹配方法，从而避免对测量噪声的过拟合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的逐点数据保真度损失函数（如均方误差）容易导致对测量噪声的过拟合。本文旨在开发一种更统计合理的数据保真度目标，能够避免这种过拟合问题。

Method: 引入分布一致性损失，这是一种基于模型概率分数的分布级校准方法，直接替代标准数据一致性项。该方法与现代正则化器兼容，优化方式与传统损失相同。

Result: 在图像去噪中，使用DC损失替代MSE损失无需提前停止即可获得更高的PSNR；在医学图像重建中，DC损失减少了高度迭代重建中的伪影，并增强了手工正则化的效果。

Conclusion: DC损失为逆问题提供了一种统计基础更扎实、性能更优的替代传统保真度损失的方法。

Abstract: Recovering true signals from noisy measurements is a central challenge in
inverse problems spanning medical imaging, geophysics, and signal processing.
Current solutions balance prior assumptions regarding the true signal
(regularization) with agreement to noisy measured data (data-fidelity).
Conventional data-fidelity loss functions, such as mean-squared error (MSE) or
negative log-likelihood, seek pointwise agreement with noisy measurements,
often leading to overfitting to noise. In this work, we instead evaluate
data-fidelity collectively by testing whether the observed measurements are
statistically consistent with the noise distributions implied by the current
estimate. We adopt this aggregated perspective and introduce distributional
consistency (DC) loss, a data-fidelity objective that replaces pointwise
matching with distribution-level calibration using model-based probability
scores for each measurement. DC loss acts as a direct and practical plug-in
replacement for standard data consistency terms: i) it is compatible with
modern regularizers, ii) it is optimized in the same way as traditional losses,
and iii) it avoids overfitting to measurement noise even without the use of
priors. Its scope naturally fits many practical inverse problems where the
measurement-noise distribution is known and where the measured dataset consists
of many independent noisy values. We demonstrate efficacy in two key example
application areas: i) in image denoising with deep image prior, using DC
instead of MSE loss removes the need for early stopping and achieves higher
PSNR; ii) in medical image reconstruction from Poisson-noisy data, DC loss
reduces artifacts in highly-iterated reconstructions and enhances the efficacy
of hand-crafted regularization. These results position DC loss as a
statistically grounded, performance-enhancing alternative to conventional
fidelity losses for inverse problems.

Motivation: 解决大语言模型在特定任务上部署时的高计算成本和内存需求问题，通过极低位量化实现高效推理。

Method: 结合三种关键技术：BitNet的SubLN模块、基于MiniLM的多头注意力蒸馏、以及作为关键预热步骤的持续预训练。

Conclusion: BitDistill提供了一种有效的轻量化解决方案，能够在保持性能的同时大幅降低大语言模型在特定任务上的部署成本。

Abstract: In this paper, we present BitNet Distillation (BitDistill), a lightweight
pipeline that fine-tunes off-the-shelf full-precision LLMs (e.g., Qwen) into
1.58-bit precision (i.e., ternary weights {-1, 0, 1}) for specific downstream
tasks, achieving strong task-specific performance with minimal computational
cost. Specifically, BitDistill incorporates three key techniques: the SubLN
module, as introduced in BitNet; multi-head attention distillation, based on
MiniLM; and continual pre-training, which serves as a crucial warm-up step to
mitigate the scalability issue of the performance gap between finetuned
full-precision and 1.58-bit LLMs on specific tasks. Experimental results show
that BitDistill achieves performance comparable to the full-precision
counterpart models across model size, while enabling up to 10x memory savings
and 2.65x faster inference on CPUs. Code is available at

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为REAP的专家剪枝方法，证明在生成任务中专家剪枝优于专家合并，能够实现近乎无损的压缩效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏激活的专家混合模型虽然训练效率高，但参数量大导致内存开销严重，需要研究专家压缩方法。

Method: 提出了基于路由器权重和专家激活范数的剪枝准则REAP，通过分析专家合并会导致功能子空间坍塌的问题，选择剪枝策略。

Result: 在20B到1T参数的SMoE模型上，REAP在生成基准测试中始终优于合并和其他剪枝方法，特别是在50%压缩率下。在代码生成和工具调用任务中，即使剪枝50%专家也能实现近乎无损的压缩。

Conclusion: 专家剪枝是生成任务中更有效的压缩策略，REAP方法能够实现高质量压缩而不引入不可约误差。

Abstract: Sparsely-activated Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE) models offer efficient
pre-training and low latency but their large parameter counts create
significant memory overhead, motivating research into expert compression.
Contrary to recent findings favouring expert merging on discriminative
benchmarks, we demonstrate that expert pruning is a superior strategy for
generative tasks. We prove that merging introduces an irreducible error by
causing a "functional subspace collapse", due to the loss of the router's
independent, input-dependent control over experts. Leveraging this insight, we
propose Router-weighted Expert Activation Pruning (REAP), a novel pruning
criterion that considers both router gate-values and expert activation norms.
Across a diverse set of SMoE models ranging from 20B to 1T parameters, REAP
consistently outperforms merging and other pruning methods on generative
benchmarks, especially at 50% compression. Notably, our method achieves
near-lossless compression on code generation and tool-calling tasks with
Qwen3-Coder-480B and Kimi-K2, even after pruning 50% of experts.

Result: 在流体动力学和相对论电动力学等PDE预测任务中，该方法持续优于基线方法

Conclusion: 条件Clifford可导向核有效提升了模型表达能力，在物理系统建模中具有优势

Abstract: Clifford-Steerable CNNs (CSCNNs) provide a unified framework that allows
incorporating equivariance to arbitrary pseudo-Euclidean groups, including
isometries of Euclidean space and Minkowski spacetime. In this work, we
demonstrate that the kernel basis of CSCNNs is not complete, thus limiting the
model expressivity. To address this issue, we propose Conditional
Clifford-Steerable Kernels, which augment the kernels with equivariant
representations computed from the input feature field. We derive the
equivariance constraint for these input-dependent kernels and show how it can
be solved efficiently via implicit parameterization. We empirically demonstrate
an improved expressivity of the resulting framework on multiple PDE forecasting
tasks, including fluid dynamics and relativistic electrodynamics, where our
method consistently outperforms baseline methods.

TL;DR: 提出了一种在几何感知优化算法基础上添加噪声自适应分层学习率的方法，显著加速了深度神经网络训练


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 即使在相同范数组内的层，局部曲率也存在异质性且动态变化，而标准几何感知优化器对同组层使用固定学习率可能效率低下

Method: 在几何感知优化算法上引入噪声自适应分层学习率方案，实时估计由所选LMO诱导的对偶范数中的梯度方差，并据此分配时变的自适应分层学习率

Result: 理论分析显示该算法达到锐利收敛率，在LLaMA和GPT等transformer架构上的实证结果表明比最先进优化器收敛更快

Conclusion: 噪声自适应分层学习率方案能有效加速深度神经网络训练，特别是在异质性曲率环境中表现优异

Abstract: Geometry-aware optimization algorithms, such as Muon, have achieved
remarkable success in training deep neural networks (DNNs). These methods
leverage the underlying geometry of DNNs by selecting appropriate norms for
different layers and updating parameters via norm-constrained linear
minimization oracles (LMOs). However, even within a group of layers associated
with the same norm, the local curvature can be heterogeneous across layers and
vary dynamically over the course of training. For example, recent work shows
that sharpness varies substantially across transformer layers and throughout
training, yet standard geometry-aware optimizers impose fixed learning rates to
layers within the same group, which may be inefficient for DNN training.
  In this paper, we introduce a noise-adaptive layerwise learning rate scheme
on top of geometry-aware optimization algorithms and substantially accelerate
DNN training compared to methods that use fixed learning rates within each
group. Our method estimates gradient variance in the dual norm induced by the
chosen LMO on the fly, and uses it to assign time-varying noise-adaptive
layerwise learning rates within each group. We provide a theoretical analysis
showing that our algorithm achieves a sharp convergence rate. Empirical results
on transformer architectures such as LLaMA and GPT demonstrate that our
approach achieves faster convergence than state-of-the-art optimizers.

TL;DR: COFFEE模型是一种新型时变状态空间模型，通过引入状态反馈机制实现上下文相关的选择性，在保持并行实现的同时显著提升了长序列依赖建模能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer模型存在二次复杂度问题和长序列依赖建模困难，而现有状态空间模型S6的选择性机制仅依赖当前输入，缺乏对序列历史的上下文感知能力。

Method: 提出COFFEE模型，通过状态反馈机制从内部状态计算选择性，使模型能基于累积上下文调节动态特性；采用高效参数化方法消除S6中的冗余。

Result: 在induction head任务中，COFFEE以比S6少两个数量级的参数和训练序列达到接近完美的准确率；在MNIST上仅用3585个参数就达到97%准确率，大幅超越S6。

Conclusion: 状态反馈是构建可扩展高效序列模型的关键机制，COFFEE展示了其在提升长序列依赖建模能力方面的显著优势。

Abstract: Transformers, powered by the attention mechanism, are the backbone of most
foundation models, yet they suffer from quadratic complexity and difficulties
in dealing with long-range dependencies in the input sequence. Recent work has
shown that state space models (SSMs) provide an efficient alternative, with the
S6 module at the core of the Mamba architecture achieving state-of-the-art
results on long-sequence benchmarks. In this paper, we introduce the COFFEE
(COntext From FEEdback) model, a novel time-varying SSM that incorporates state
feedback to enable context-dependent selectivity, while still allowing for
parallel implementation. Whereas the selectivity mechanism of S6 only depends
on the current input, COFFEE computes it from the internal state, which serves
as a compact representation of the sequence history. This shift allows the
model to regulate its dynamics based on accumulated context, improving its
ability to capture long-range dependencies. In addition to state feedback, we
employ an efficient model parametrization that removes redundancies present in
S6 and leads to a more compact and trainable formulation. On the induction head
task, COFFEE achieves near-perfect accuracy with two orders of magnitude fewer
parameters and training sequences compared to S6. On MNIST, COFFEE largely
outperforms S6 within the same architecture, reaching 97% accuracy with only
3585 parameters. These results showcase the role of state feedback as a key
mechanism for building scalable and efficient sequence models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个新的因果表示学习基准，使用高保真模拟视觉数据，包含约20万张图像和300万视频帧，涵盖4个领域：静态图像生成、动态物理模拟、机器人操作和交通状况分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有因果表示学习的评估方法存在两难困境：要么使用过于简化的合成数据集，要么依赖现实世界任务的下游性能，难以兼顾真实性和评估精度。

Method: 创建包含24个子场景的模拟数据集，提供对真实因果生成过程的访问，允许用户修改底层因果结构以符合CRL假设。

Result: 构建了全面的测试平台，弥合了严格评估与现实世界适用性之间的差距，并评估了代表性CRL方法。

Conclusion: 该基准为从业者和新手提供了选择或扩展适当CRL框架的经验见解，以解决能从CRL视角受益的特定现实问题。

Abstract: Causal Representation Learning (CRL) aims to uncover the data-generating
process and identify the underlying causal variables and relations, whose
evaluation remains inherently challenging due to the requirement of known
ground-truth causal variables and causal structure. Existing evaluations often
rely on either simplistic synthetic datasets or downstream performance on
real-world tasks, generally suffering a dilemma between realism and evaluative
precision. In this paper, we introduce a new benchmark for CRL using
high-fidelity simulated visual data that retains both realistic visual
complexity and, more importantly, access to ground-truth causal generating
processes. The dataset comprises around 200 thousand images and 3 million video
frames across 24 sub-scenes in four domains: static image generation, dynamic
physical simulations, robotic manipulations, and traffic situation analysis.
These scenarios range from static to dynamic settings, simple to complex
structures, and single to multi-agent interactions, offering a comprehensive
testbed that hopefully bridges the gap between rigorous evaluation and
real-world applicability. In addition, we provide flexible access to the
underlying causal structures, allowing users to modify or configure them to
align with the required assumptions in CRL, such as available domain labels,
temporal dependencies, or intervention histories. Leveraging this benchmark, we
evaluated representative CRL methods across diverse paradigms and offered
empirical insights to assist practitioners and newcomers in choosing or
extending appropriate CRL frameworks to properly address specific types of real
problems that can benefit from the CRL perspective. Welcome to visit our:

Conclusion: FedHFT框架有效解决了联邦学习中数据隐私保护和资源异构的挑战，为个性化NLU应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Fine-tuning pre-trained large language models (LLMs) has become a common
practice for personalized natural language understanding (NLU) applications on
downstream tasks and domain-specific datasets. However, there are two main
challenges: (i) limited and/or heterogeneous data for fine-tuning due to
proprietary data confidentiality or privacy requirements, and (ii) varying
computation resources available across participating clients such as edge
devices. This paper presents FedHFT - an efficient and personalized federated
fine-tuning framework to address both challenges. First, we introduce a mixture
of masked adapters to handle resource heterogeneity across participating
clients, enabling high-performance collaborative fine-tuning of pre-trained
language model(s) across multiple clients in a distributed setting, while
keeping proprietary data local. Second, we introduce a bi-level optimization
approach to handle non-iid data distribution based on masked personalization
and client clustering. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant
performance and efficiency improvements over various natural language
understanding tasks under data and resource heterogeneity compared to
representative heterogeneous federated learning methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究稀疏maxout网络的表达能力，这类网络捕捉了卷积神经网络和图神经网络的关键特征。

Method: 建立了稀疏maxout网络与一类虚拟多面体之间的对偶关系，将网络几何与表达能力问题联系起来，推导了相关多面体维度的紧界。

Result: 构建了深度层次结构序列，证明了足够深的稀疏maxout网络是通用的，但如果深度不足，仅靠宽度无法补偿固定入度约束的稀疏性。

Conclusion: 稀疏maxout网络的表达能力受深度和稀疏性共同影响，深度不足时宽度无法弥补表达能力的限制。

Abstract: We study the expressivity of sparse maxout networks, where each neuron takes
a fixed number of inputs from the previous layer and employs a, possibly
multi-argument, maxout activation. This setting captures key characteristics of
convolutional or graph neural networks. We establish a duality between
functions computable by such networks and a class of virtual polytopes, linking
their geometry to questions of network expressivity. In particular, we derive a
tight bound on the dimension of the associated polytopes, which serves as the
central tool for our analysis. Building on this, we construct a sequence of
depth hierarchies. While sufficiently deep sparse maxout networks are
universal, we prove that if the required depth is not reached, width alone
cannot compensate for the sparsity of a fixed indegree constraint.

TL;DR: 提出Neural Effect Search方法，通过预训练基础模型和稀疏自编码器从试验数据中无监督发现未知因果效应，解决了多重检验和效应纠缠问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随机对照试验依赖人工假设且分析成本高，限制了因果效应的大规模估计，可能导致停留在流行但不完整的假设上。

Method: 使用预训练基础模型将非结构化数据转化为有意义的表示，通过稀疏自编码器进行解释，并引入Neural Effect Search递归程序通过渐进分层解决多重检验和效应纠缠问题。

Result: 在半合成实验中验证了算法的鲁棒性，在实验生态学背景下首次实现了真实世界科学试验中的无监督因果效应识别。

Conclusion: 该方法能够直接从数据中发现未知的因果效应，为大规模因果推断提供了新途径。

Abstract: Randomized Controlled Trials are one of the pillars of science; nevertheless,
they rely on hand-crafted hypotheses and expensive analysis. Such constraints
prevent causal effect estimation at scale, potentially anchoring on popular yet
incomplete hypotheses. We propose to discover the unknown effects of a
treatment directly from data. For this, we turn unstructured data from a trial
into meaningful representations via pretrained foundation models and interpret
them via a sparse autoencoder. However, discovering significant causal effects
at the neural level is not trivial due to multiple-testing issues and effects
entanglement. To address these challenges, we introduce Neural Effect Search, a
novel recursive procedure solving both issues by progressive stratification.
After assessing the robustness of our algorithm on semi-synthetic experiments,
we showcase, in the context of experimental ecology, the first successful
unsupervised causal effect identification on a real-world scientific trial.

Abstract: Reaction-diffusion systems represent one of the most fundamental formulations
used to describe a wide range of physical, chemical, and biological processes.
With the increasing adoption of neural networks, recent research has focused on
solving differential equations using machine learning techniques. However, the
theoretical foundation explaining why neural networks can effectively
approximate such solutions remains insufficiently explored.
  This paper provides a theoretical analysis of the approximation power of
neural networks for one- and two-dimensional reaction-diffusion equations in
both homogeneous and heterogeneous media. Building upon the universal
approximation theorem, we demonstrate that a two-layer neural network can
approximate the one-dimensional reaction-diffusion equation, while a
three-layer neural network can approximate its two-dimensional counterpart. The
theoretical framework presented here can be further extended to elliptic and
parabolic equations.
  Overall, this work highlights the expressive power of neural networks in
approximating solutions to reaction-diffusion equations and related PDEs,
providing a theoretical foundation for neural network-based differential
equation solvers.

Result: 这些机制共同形成了Transformer网络中本机且可扩展的潜在空间推理架构方法，具有强大的算法泛化能力。

Conclusion: 通过机制可解释性分析揭示了这些机制如何产生稳健的OOD泛化能力，为增强Transformer的推理能力提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Systematic, compositional generalization beyond the training distribution
remains a core challenge in machine learning -- and a critical bottleneck for
the emergent reasoning abilities of modern language models. This work
investigates out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization in Transformer networks
using a GSM8K-style modular arithmetic on computational graphs task as a
testbed. We introduce and explore a set of four architectural mechanisms aimed
at enhancing OOD generalization: (i) input-adaptive recurrence; (ii)
algorithmic supervision; (iii) anchored latent representations via a discrete
bottleneck; and (iv) an explicit error-correction mechanism. Collectively,
these mechanisms yield an architectural approach for native and scalable latent
space reasoning in Transformer networks with robust algorithmic generalization
capabilities. We complement these empirical results with a detailed mechanistic
interpretability analysis that reveals how these mechanisms give rise to robust
OOD generalization abilities.

Abstract: Transfer entropy measures directed information flow in time series, and it
has become a fundamental quantity in applications spanning neuroscience,
finance, and complex systems analysis. However, existing estimation methods
suffer from the curse of dimensionality, require restrictive distributional
assumptions, or need exponentially large datasets for reliable convergence. We
address these limitations in the literature by proposing TENDE (Transfer
Entropy Neural Diffusion Estimation), a novel approach that leverages
score-based diffusion models to estimate transfer entropy through conditional
mutual information. By learning score functions of the relevant conditional
distributions, TENDE provides flexible, scalable estimation while making
minimal assumptions about the underlying data-generating process. We
demonstrate superior accuracy and robustness compared to existing neural
estimators and other state-of-the-art approaches across synthetic benchmarks
and real data.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We study a two-sided market, wherein, price-sensitive heterogeneous customers
and servers arrive and join their respective queues. A compatible
customer-server pair can then be matched by the platform, at which point, they
leave the system. Our objective is to design pricing and matching algorithms
that maximize the platform's profit, while maintaining reasonable queue
lengths. As the demand and supply curves governing the price-dependent arrival
rates may not be known in practice, we design a novel online-learning-based
pricing policy and establish its near-optimality. In particular, we prove a
tradeoff among three performance metrics: $\tilde{O}(T^{1-\gamma})$ regret,
$\tilde{O}(T^{\gamma/2})$ average queue length, and $\tilde{O}(T^{\gamma})$
maximum queue length for $\gamma \in (0, 1/6]$, significantly improving over
existing results [1]. Moreover, barring the permissible range of $\gamma$, we
show that this trade-off between regret and average queue length is optimal up
to logarithmic factors under a class of policies, matching the optimal one as
in [2] which assumes the demand and supply curves to be known. Our proposed
policy has two noteworthy features: a dynamic component that optimizes the
tradeoff between low regret and small queue lengths; and a probabilistic
component that resolves the tension between obtaining useful samples for fast
learning and maintaining small queue lengths.

Abstract: Diffusion models enable the synthesis of highly accurate samples from complex
distributions and have become foundational in generative modeling. Recently,
they have demonstrated significant potential for solving Bayesian inverse
problems by serving as priors. This review offers a comprehensive overview of
current methods that leverage \emph{pre-trained} diffusion models alongside
Monte Carlo methods to address Bayesian inverse problems without requiring
additional training. We show that these methods primarily employ a
\emph{twisting} mechanism for the intermediate distributions within the
diffusion process, guiding the simulations toward the posterior distribution.
We describe how various Monte Carlo methods are then used to aid in sampling
from these twisted distributions.

Abstract: In this work, we take a first step toward elucidating the mechanisms behind
emergent exploration in unsupervised reinforcement learning. We study
Single-Goal Contrastive Reinforcement Learning (SGCRL), a self-supervised
algorithm capable of solving challenging long-horizon goal-reaching tasks
without external rewards or curricula. We combine theoretical analysis of the
algorithm's objective function with controlled experiments to understand what
drives its exploration. We show that SGCRL maximizes implicit rewards shaped by
its learned representations. These representations automatically modify the
reward landscape to promote exploration before reaching the goal and
exploitation thereafter. Our experiments also demonstrate that these
exploration dynamics arise from learning low-rank representations of the state
space rather than from neural network function approximation. Our improved
understanding enables us to adapt SGCRL to perform safety-aware exploration.

Abstract: The p-persistent CSMA protocol is central to random-access MAC analysis, but
predicting saturation throughput in heterogeneous multi-hop wireless networks
remains a hard problem. Simplified models that assume a single, shared
interference domain can underestimate throughput by 48--62\% in sparse
topologies. Exact Markov-chain analyses are accurate but scale exponentially in
computation time, making them impractical for large networks. These
computational barriers motivate structural machine learning approaches like
GNNs for scalable throughput prediction in general network topologies. Yet
off-the-shelf GNNs struggle here: a standard GCN yields 63.94\% normalized mean
absolute error (NMAE) on heterogeneous networks because symmetric normalization
conflates a node's direct interference with higher-order, cascading effects
that pertain to how interference propagates over the network graph.
  Building on these insights, we propose the Decoupled Graph Convolutional
Network (D-GCN), a novel architecture that explicitly separates processing of a
node's own transmission probability from neighbor interference effects. D-GCN
replaces mean aggregation with learnable attention, yielding interpretable,
per-neighbor contribution weights while capturing complex multihop interference
patterns. D-GCN attains 3.3\% NMAE, outperforms strong baselines, remains
tractable even when exact analytical methods become computationally infeasible,
and enables gradient-based network optimization that achieves within 1\% of
theoretical optima.

Abstract: Introduction Accurate prediction of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) is
crucial for understanding cellular functions and advancing drug development.
Existing in-silico methods use direct sequence embeddings from Protein Language
Models (PLMs). Others use Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for 3D protein
structures. This study explores less computationally intensive alternatives. We
introduce a novel framework for downstream PPI prediction through link
prediction. Methods We introduce a two-stage graph representation learning
framework, ProtGram-DirectGCN. First, we developed ProtGram. This approach
models a protein's primary structure as a hierarchy of globally inferred n-gram
graphs. In these graphs, residue transition probabilities define edge weights.
Each edge connects a pair of residues in a directed graph. The probabilities
are aggregated from a large corpus of sequences. Second, we propose DirectGCN,
a custom directed graph convolutional neural network. This model features a
unique convolutional layer. It processes information through separate
path-specific transformations: incoming, outgoing, and undirected. A shared
transformation is also applied. These paths are combined via a learnable gating
mechanism. We apply DirectGCN to ProtGram graphs to learn residue-level
embeddings. These embeddings are pooled via attention to generate protein-level
embeddings for prediction. Results We first established the efficacy of
DirectGCN on standard node classification benchmarks. Its performance matches
established methods on general datasets. The model excels at complex, directed
graphs with dense, heterophilic structures. When applied to PPI prediction, the
full ProtGram-DirectGCN framework delivers robust predictive power. This strong
performance holds even with limited training data.

Abstract: Quantitative trading strategies rely on accurately ranking stocks to identify
profitable investments. Effective portfolio management requires models that can
reliably order future stock returns. Transformer models are promising for
understanding financial time series, but how different training loss functions
affect their ability to rank stocks well is not yet fully understood. Financial
markets are challenging due to their changing nature and complex relationships
between stocks. Standard loss functions, which aim for simple prediction
accuracy, often aren't enough. They don't directly teach models to learn the
correct order of stock returns. While many advanced ranking losses exist from
fields such as information retrieval, there hasn't been a thorough comparison
to see how well they work for ranking financial returns, especially when used
with modern Transformer models for stock selection. This paper addresses this
gap by systematically evaluating a diverse set of advanced loss functions
including pointwise, pairwise, listwise for daily stock return forecasting to
facilitate rank-based portfolio selection on S&P 500 data. We focus on
assessing how each loss function influences the model's ability to discern
profitable relative orderings among assets. Our research contributes a
comprehensive benchmark revealing how different loss functions impact a model's
ability to learn cross-sectional and temporal patterns crucial for portfolio
selection, thereby offering practical guidance for optimizing ranking-based
trading strategies.

Abstract: In the evolving domains of Machine Learning and Data Analytics, existing
dataset characterization methods such as statistical, structural, and
model-based analyses often fail to deliver the deep understanding and insights
essential for innovation and explainability. This work surveys the current
state-of-the-art conventional data analytic techniques and examines their

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统融合方法应用于低秩权重时会导致严重的性能退化，需要一种能够保留原始模型性能的新方法。

Method: 构建紧凑基空间，通过线性组合恢复原始任务特定模型，提供闭式解来选择最优权重基和任务特定系数。

Result: 在多样化数据集和模型规模上的实验表明，RMM始终优于现有融合方法，显著保留了低秩压缩模型的性能。

Conclusion: RMM提供了一种高效、无需数据且灵活的模型融合方法，能够通过可逆方式保持各任务特定模型的性能优势。

Abstract: Model merging aims to combine multiple fine-tuned models into a single set of
weights that performs well across all source tasks. While prior work has shown
that merging can approximate the performance of individual fine-tuned models
for each task, it largely overlooks scenarios where models are compressed into
low-rank representations, either through low-rank adaptation (LoRA) or
post-training singular value decomposition (SVD). We first demonstrate that
applying conventional merging methods to low-rank weights leads to severe
performance degradation in the merged model. Motivated by this phenomenon, we
propose a fundamentally different approach: instead of collapsing all adapters
into one set of weights, we construct a compact basis (e.g., an equivalent of
holding two or more models) from which original task-specific models can be
recovered via linear combination. This reframes merging as generating a
reconstruction-capable model space rather than producing a single merged model.
Crucially, this allows us to ``revert'' to each individual model when needed,
recognizing that no merged model can consistently outperform one specialized
for its task. Building on this insight, we introduce our method, Reversible
Model Merging (RMM), an efficient, data-free, and flexible method that provides
a closed-form solution for selecting the optimal basis of model weights and
task-specific coefficients for linear combination. Extensive experiments across
diverse datasets and model scales demonstrate that RMM consistently outperforms
existing merging approaches, preserving the performance of low-rank compressed
models by a significant margin.

Motivation: 观察到反向传播算法与动态系统最优性条件（通过动态规划表达）之间存在显著的算法相似性，这种联系为基于动态系统和最优控制理论的原理性算法设计提供了新的机会。

Method: 将深度神经网络解释为动态系统，通过求解贝尔曼方程的一阶展开近似动态规划，开发了OCNOpt优化器，探索了贝尔曼方程的高阶展开，支持层间反馈策略、博弈论应用和连续时间模型的高阶训练。

Conclusion: OCNOpt为基于动态系统和最优控制理论的原理性算法设计开辟了新途径，证明了将最优控制理论应用于神经网络优化的有效性。

Abstract: Optimization of deep neural networks (DNNs) has been a driving force in the
advancement of modern machine learning and artificial intelligence. With DNNs
characterized by a prolonged sequence of nonlinear propagation, determining
their optimal parameters given an objective naturally fits within the framework
of Optimal Control Programming. Such an interpretation of DNNs as dynamical
systems has proven crucial in offering a theoretical foundation for principled
analysis from numerical equations to physics. In parallel to these theoretical
pursuits, this paper focuses on an algorithmic perspective. Our motivated
observation is the striking algorithmic resemblance between the Backpropagation
algorithm for computing gradients in DNNs and the optimality conditions for
dynamical systems, expressed through another backward process known as dynamic
programming. Consolidating this connection, where Backpropagation admits a
variational structure, solving an approximate dynamic programming up to the
first-order expansion leads to a new class of optimization methods exploring
higher-order expansions of the Bellman equation. The resulting optimizer,
termed Optimal Control Theoretic Neural Optimizer (OCNOpt), enables rich
algorithmic opportunities, including layer-wise feedback policies,
game-theoretic applications, and higher-order training of continuous-time
models such as Neural ODEs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OCNOpt
improves upon existing methods in robustness and efficiency while maintaining
manageable computational complexity, paving new avenues for principled
algorithmic design grounded in dynamical systems and optimal control theory.

TL;DR: MAFA是一个生产部署的多智能体标注框架，通过可配置的多智能体协作解决金融服务中的大规模标注积压问题，在JP Morgan Chase成功消除了100万条话语积压，平均与人工标注者达成86%一致，每年节省5000多小时人工标注工作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决金融服务中数百万客户话语需要准确分类的标注积压关键挑战，传统方法效率低下且成本高昂。

Method: 结合专门化智能体与结构化推理和基于评判的共识机制，支持通过配置而非代码更改定义自定义标注类型，实现动态任务适应。

Result: 在JP Morgan Chase部署中消除了100万条话语积压，平均86%与人工标注一致，每年节省5000多小时；在内部意图分类数据集上比传统方法Top-1准确率提高13.8%，Top-5准确率提高15.1%，F1提高16.9%。

Conclusion: 该工作弥合了理论多智能体系统与实际企业部署之间的差距，为面临类似标注挑战的组织提供了蓝图。

Abstract: We present MAFA (Multi-Agent Framework for Annotation), a production-deployed
system that transforms enterprise-scale annotation workflows through
configurable multi-agent collaboration. Addressing the critical challenge of
annotation backlogs in financial services, where millions of customer
utterances require accurate categorization, MAFA combines specialized agents
with structured reasoning and a judge-based consensus mechanism. Our framework
uniquely supports dynamic task adaptation, allowing organizations to define
custom annotation types (FAQs, intents, entities, or domain-specific
categories) through configuration rather than code changes. Deployed at JP
Morgan Chase, MAFA has eliminated a 1 million utterance backlog while
achieving, on average, 86% agreement with human annotators, annually saving
over 5,000 hours of manual annotation work. The system processes utterances
with annotation confidence classifications, which are typically 85% high, 10%
medium, and 5% low across all datasets we tested. This enables human annotators
to focus exclusively on ambiguous and low-coverage cases. We demonstrate MAFA's
effectiveness across multiple datasets and languages, showing consistent
improvements over traditional and single-agent annotation baselines: 13.8%
higher Top-1 accuracy, 15.1% improvement in Top-5 accuracy, and 16.9% better F1
in our internal intent classification dataset and similar gains on public
benchmarks. This work bridges the gap between theoretical multi-agent systems
and practical enterprise deployment, providing a blueprint for organizations
facing similar annotation challenges.

TL;DR: ConDA框架通过对比学习在扩散嵌入中组织潜在空间，使潜在几何与系统动态对齐，支持非线性轨迹遍历以实现可控生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型擅长生成，但其潜在空间未明确组织以实现可解释控制。受对比学习能恢复更解耦和结构化表示的启发，需要组织扩散潜在空间以反映底层动态因素。

Method: 在扩散嵌入中应用对比学习，使潜在几何与系统动态对齐。通过对比性结构空间实现非线性轨迹遍历，支持插值、外推和可控生成。

Result: 在流体动力学、神经钙成像、治疗性神经刺激和面部表情等基准测试中，ConDA产生可解释的潜在表示，相比线性遍历和基于条件的方法具有更好的可控性。

Conclusion: 扩散潜在编码了动态相关结构，但利用这种结构需要潜在组织并沿着潜在流形进行遍历。

Abstract: Diffusion models excel at generation, but their latent spaces are not
explicitly organized for interpretable control. We introduce ConDA (Contrastive
Diffusion Alignment), a framework that applies contrastive learning within
diffusion embeddings to align latent geometry with system dynamics. Motivated
by recent advances showing that contrastive objectives can recover more
disentangled and structured representations, ConDA organizes diffusion latents
such that traversal directions reflect underlying dynamical factors. Within
this contrastively structured space, ConDA enables nonlinear trajectory
traversal that supports faithful interpolation, extrapolation, and controllable
generation. Across benchmarks in fluid dynamics, neural calcium imaging,
therapeutic neurostimulation, and facial expression, ConDA produces
interpretable latent representations with improved controllability compared to
linear traversals and conditioning-based baselines. These results suggest that
diffusion latents encode dynamics-relevant structure, but exploiting this
structure requires latent organization and traversal along the latent manifold.

Motivation: 联邦学习虽然能保护数据隐私，但面临参与困境问题——参与实体不愿贡献资源或可能搭便车，这限制了联邦学习的实际适应性。

Method: 应用经济学和博弈论的基础概念，结合区块链和深度强化学习等技术解决方案，构建了基于集中式和去中心化架构的全面分类法。

Result: 展示了激励机制在医疗、智能基础设施、车载网络和区块链去中心化系统等新兴工业应用中的实际应用前景。

Conclusion: 精心设计的激励机制不是可选功能，而是联邦学习实际成功的关键组成部分，但仍需解决可持续性、公平性和鲁棒性方面的重大挑战。

Abstract: Federated learning promises to revolutionize machine learning by enabling
collaborative model training without compromising data privacy. However,
practical adaptability can be limited by critical factors, such as the
participation dilemma. Participating entities are often unwilling to contribute
to a learning system unless they receive some benefits, or they may pretend to
participate and free-ride on others. This chapter identifies the fundamental
challenges in designing incentive mechanisms for federated learning systems. It
examines how foundational concepts from economics and game theory can be
applied to federated learning, alongside technology-driven solutions such as
blockchain and deep reinforcement learning. This work presents a comprehensive
taxonomy that thoroughly covers both centralized and decentralized
architectures based on the aforementioned theoretical concepts. Furthermore,
the concepts described are presented from an application perspective, covering
emerging industrial applications, including healthcare, smart infrastructure,
vehicular networks, and blockchain-based decentralized systems. Through this
exploration, this chapter demonstrates that well-designed incentive mechanisms
are not merely optional features but essential components for the practical
success of federated learning. This analysis reveals both the promising
solutions that have emerged and the significant challenges that remain in
building truly sustainable, fair, and robust federated learning ecosystems.

TL;DR: 对分子核进行首次全面谱分析，发现更丰富的谱特征并不总能提高预测精度，在某些情况下甚至与性能呈负相关。研究挑战了"更丰富谱带来更好泛化"的启发式观点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然深度模型在分子性质预测中达到最先进精度，但核方法因其在低数据环境下的鲁棒性和透明理论基础仍被广泛使用。尽管机器学习中对核谱有广泛研究，但对分子核的系统谱分析却很稀缺。

Method: 在QM9数据集上对分子指纹、预训练transformer、全局和局部3D表示等七种分子性质进行核岭回归的全面谱分析，使用四种不同谱度量指标，并实现截断核来探究谱与预测性能的关系。

Result: 令人惊讶的是，更丰富的谱特征并不一致提高精度。对于transformer和局部3D表示，谱丰富度甚至与性能呈负相关。在许多核中，仅保留前2%的特征值就能恢复几乎所有性能，表明主导特征值捕获了最具信息量的特征。

Conclusion: 研究结果挑战了"更丰富谱带来更好泛化"的常见启发式观点，突出了表示、核特征与预测性能之间的微妙关系。这些发现为在数据受限的科学和实际任务中评估核和自监督学习方法提供了信息。

Abstract: Understanding the spectral properties of kernels offers a principled
perspective on generalization and representation quality. While deep models
achieve state-of-the-art accuracy in molecular property prediction, kernel
methods remain widely used for their robustness in low-data regimes and
transparent theoretical grounding. Despite extensive studies of kernel spectra
in machine learning, systematic spectral analyses of molecular kernels are
scarce. In this work, we provide the first comprehensive spectral analysis of
kernel ridge regression on the QM9 dataset, molecular fingerprint, pretrained
transformer-based, global and local 3D representations across seven molecular
properties. Surprisingly, richer spectral features, measured by four different
spectral metrics, do not consistently improve accuracy. Pearson correlation
tests further reveal that for transformer-based and local 3D representations,
spectral richness can even have a negative correlation with performance. We
also implement truncated kernels to probe the relationship between spectrum and
predictive performance: in many kernels, retaining only the top 2% of
eigenvalues recovers nearly all performance, indicating that the leading
eigenvalues capture the most informative features. Our results challenge the
common heuristic that "richer spectra yield better generalization" and
highlight nuanced relationships between representation, kernel features, and
predictive performance. Beyond molecular property prediction, these findings
inform how kernel and self-supervised learning methods are evaluated in
data-limited scientific and real-world tasks.

TL;DR: 该论文揭示了平坦极小值与对抗鲁棒性的复杂关系：平坦性仅保证局部鲁棒性而非全局鲁棒性，对抗样本常位于模型自信错误的平坦区域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管神经网络经验上成功，但仍易受微小对抗扰动影响。长期假设认为平坦极小值（损失景观中低曲率区域）能提供更强鲁棒性，但这种联系缺乏严格形式化分析。

Method: 首先推导倒数第二层相对平坦度的闭式表达式，利用此约束输入空间中损失的变化，从而形式化分析整个网络的对抗鲁棒性。通过理论和实验验证，揭示控制对抗脆弱性的几何结构。

Result: 平坦性仅能保证局部邻域内的对抗鲁棒性，要维持更大范围的鲁棒性，损失需要在数据流形外急剧弯曲。实验验证了理论预测，发现对抗样本常位于模型自信错误的大平坦区域。

Conclusion: 研究挑战了对平坦性的简化理解，提供了关于平坦性在鲁棒性中作用的细致认识：平坦极小值仅提供局部保护，全局鲁棒性需要不同的几何特性。

Abstract: Despite their empirical success, neural networks remain vulnerable to small,
adversarial perturbations. A longstanding hypothesis suggests that flat minima,
regions of low curvature in the loss landscape, offer increased robustness.
While intuitive, this connection has remained largely informal and incomplete.
By rigorously formalizing the relationship, we show this intuition is only
partially correct: flatness implies local but not global adversarial
robustness. To arrive at this result, we first derive a closed-form expression
for relative flatness in the penultimate layer, and then show we can use this
to constrain the variation of the loss in input space. This allows us to
formally analyze the adversarial robustness of the entire network. We then show
that to maintain robustness beyond a local neighborhood, the loss needs to
curve sharply away from the data manifold. We validate our theoretical
predictions empirically across architectures and datasets, uncovering the
geometric structure that governs adversarial vulnerability, and linking
flatness to model confidence: adversarial examples often lie in large, flat
regions where the model is confidently wrong. Our results challenge simplified
views of flatness and provide a nuanced understanding of its role in
robustness.

Abstract: Competitive programming has become a rigorous benchmark for evaluating the
reasoning and problem-solving capabilities of large language models (LLMs). The
International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI) stands out as one of the most
prestigious annual competitions in competitive programming and has become a key
benchmark for comparing human and AI-level programming ability. While several
proprietary models have been claimed to achieve gold medal-level performance at
the IOI, often with undisclosed methods, achieving comparable results with
open-weight models remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we present
\gencluster, a scalable and reproducible test-time compute framework that
attains IOI gold-level performance using open-weight models. It combines
large-scale generation, behavioral clustering, ranking, and a round-robin
submission strategy to efficiently explore diverse solution spaces under
limited validation budgets. Our experiments show that the performance of our
proposed approach scales consistently with available compute, narrowing the gap
between open and closed systems. Notably, we will show that GenCluster can
achieve a gold medal at IOI 2025 for the first time with an open-weight model
gpt-oss-120b, setting a new benchmark for transparent and reproducible
evaluation of reasoning in LLMs.

Abstract: Decision-making under distribution shift is a central challenge in
reinforcement learning (RL), where training and deployment environments differ.
We study this problem through the lens of robust Markov decision processes
(RMDPs), which optimize performance against adversarial transition dynamics.
Our focus is the online setting, where the agent has only limited interaction
with the environment, making sample efficiency and exploration especially
critical. Policy optimization, despite its success in standard RL, remains
theoretically and empirically underexplored in robust RL. To bridge this gap,
we propose \textbf{D}istributionally \textbf{R}obust \textbf{R}egularized
\textbf{P}olicy \textbf{O}ptimization algorithm (DR-RPO), a model-free online
policy optimization method that learns robust policies with sublinear regret.
To enable tractable optimization within the softmax policy class, DR-RPO
incorporates reference-policy regularization, yielding RMDP variants that are
doubly constrained in both transitions and policies. To scale to large
state-action spaces, we adopt the $d$-rectangular linear MDP formulation and
combine linear function approximation with an upper confidence bonus for
optimistic exploration. We provide theoretical guarantees showing that policy
optimization can achieve polynomial suboptimality bounds and sample efficiency
in robust RL, matching the performance of value-based approaches. Finally,
empirical results across diverse domains corroborate our theory and demonstrate
the robustness of DR-RPO.

Result: 在波浪水槽数据集上的实验表明，PhysAttnNet显著优于主流模型，跨场景泛化测试验证了模型对未见环境的鲁棒性和适应性。

Conclusion: PhysAttnNet作为海洋工程中复杂系统预测模型的开发框架具有重要潜力，能够有效提升弹性布拉格防波堤运动响应的预测精度和泛化能力。

Abstract: Accurate motion response prediction for elastic Bragg breakwaters is critical
for their structural safety and operational integrity in marine environments.
However, conventional deep learning models often exhibit limited generalization
capabilities when presented with unseen sea states. These deficiencies stem
from the neglect of natural decay observed in marine systems and inadequate
modeling of wave-structure interaction (WSI). To overcome these challenges,
this study proposes a novel Physics Prior-Guided Dual-Stream Attention Network
(PhysAttnNet). First, the decay bidirectional self-attention (DBSA) module
incorporates a learnable temporal decay to assign higher weights to recent
states, aiming to emulate the natural decay phenomenon. Meanwhile, the phase
differences guided bidirectional cross-attention (PDG-BCA) module explicitly
captures the bidirectional interaction and phase relationship between waves and
the structure using a cosine-based bias within a bidirectional
cross-computation paradigm. These streams are synergistically integrated
through a global context fusion (GCF) module. Finally, PhysAttnNet is trained
with a hybrid time-frequency loss that jointly minimizes time-domain prediction
errors and frequency-domain spectral discrepancies. Comprehensive experiments
on wave flume datasets demonstrate that PhysAttnNet significantly outperforms
mainstream models. Furthermore,cross-scenario generalization tests validate the
model's robustness and adaptability to unseen environments, highlighting its
potential as a framework to develop predictive models for complex systems in
ocean engineering.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着基础模型在时间序列分析中的应用增加，需要系统比较通用型和专用型模型在生理信号处理中的表现差异，特别是针对PPG信号

Method: 使用包含51个任务的综合评估套件，涵盖心脏状态评估、实验室值估计和跨模态推理，从7个维度（胜率、平均性能、特征质量等）评估模型

Result: 在完全微调场景下，专用型模型比通用型模型胜率高出27%，在多个评估维度上表现更优

Conclusion: 专用型时间序列基础模型在PPG信号分析任务中表现优于通用型模型，特别是在完全微调场景下

Abstract: Foundation models are large-scale machine learning models that are
pre-trained on massive amounts of data and can be adapted for various
downstream tasks. They have been extensively applied to tasks in Natural
Language Processing and Computer Vision with models such as GPT, BERT, and
CLIP. They are now also increasingly gaining attention in time-series analysis,
particularly for physiological sensing. However, most time series foundation
models are specialist models - with data in pre-training and testing of the
same type, such as Electrocardiogram, Electroencephalogram, and
Photoplethysmogram (PPG). Recent works, such as MOMENT, train a generalist time
series foundation model with data from multiple domains, such as weather,
traffic, and electricity. This paper aims to conduct a comprehensive
benchmarking study to compare the performance of generalist and specialist
models, with a focus on PPG signals. Through an extensive suite of total 51
tasks covering cardiac state assessment, laboratory value estimation, and
cross-modal inference, we comprehensively evaluate both models across seven
dimensions, including win score, average performance, feature quality, tuning
gain, performance variance, transferability, and scalability. These metrics
jointly capture not only the models' capability but also their adaptability,
robustness, and efficiency under different fine-tuning strategies, providing a
holistic understanding of their strengths and limitations for diverse
downstream scenarios. In a full-tuning scenario, we demonstrate that the
specialist model achieves a 27% higher win score. Finally, we provide further
analysis on generalization, fairness, attention visualizations, and the
importance of training data choice.

TL;DR: CAST是一个无需探针的框架，通过直接估计变换矩阵和频谱分析来理解Transformer层功能，揭示了编码器和解码器模型的不同行为模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型虽然成功但仍是黑盒，现有可解释性方法各有局限，需要新的互补视角来理解模型内部机制。

Method: 使用Moore-Penrose伪逆估计每层的实际变换矩阵，应用六个可解释指标进行频谱分析，通过核分析研究层间功能关系。

Result: 发现解码器模型呈现压缩-扩展循环，编码器模型保持高秩处理；CKA相似性矩阵将层分为特征提取、压缩和专业化三个阶段。

Conclusion: CAST提供了与现有方法互补的见解，通过直接矩阵估计和频谱分析揭示了Transformer层的功能特性和行为模式。

Abstract: Large language models have achieved remarkable success but remain largely
black boxes with poorly understood internal mechanisms. To address this
limitation, many researchers have proposed various interpretability methods
including mechanistic analysis, probing classifiers, and activation
visualization, each providing valuable insights from different perspectives.
Building upon this rich landscape of complementary approaches, we introduce
CAST (Compositional Analysis via Spectral Tracking), a probe-free framework
that contributes a novel perspective by analyzing transformer layer functions
through direct transformation matrix estimation and comprehensive spectral
analysis. CAST offers complementary insights to existing methods by estimating
the realized transformation matrices for each layer using Moore-Penrose
pseudoinverse and applying spectral analysis with six interpretable metrics
characterizing layer behavior. Our analysis reveals distinct behaviors between
encoder-only and decoder-only models, with decoder models exhibiting
compression-expansion cycles while encoder models maintain consistent high-rank
processing. Kernel analysis further demonstrates functional relationship
patterns between layers, with CKA similarity matrices clearly partitioning
layers into three phases: feature extraction, compression, and specialization.

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于扩散模型的非参数归因方法，通过图像块级相似度来衡量训练样本对生成输出的影响，无需模型梯度或重训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型归因方法需要模型梯度或重训练，限制了在专有或大规模设置中的适用性。

Method: 基于数据驱动的非参数方法，通过图像块级相似度计算影响，利用最优得分函数的解析形式，支持多尺度表示并通过卷积加速计算。

Result: 实验表明该方法实现了强大的归因性能，与基于梯度的方法接近，并显著优于现有非参数基线。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了空间可解释的归因结果，揭示了训练数据与输出之间的内在关系，且独立于特定模型。

Abstract: Data attribution for generative models seeks to quantify the influence of
individual training examples on model outputs. Existing methods for diffusion
models typically require access to model gradients or retraining, limiting
their applicability in proprietary or large-scale settings. We propose a
nonparametric attribution method that operates entirely on data, measuring
influence via patch-level similarity between generated and training images. Our
approach is grounded in the analytical form of the optimal score function and
naturally extends to multiscale representations, while remaining
computationally efficient through convolution-based acceleration. In addition
to producing spatially interpretable attributions, our framework uncovers
patterns that reflect intrinsic relationships between training data and
outputs, independent of any specific model. Experiments demonstrate that our
method achieves strong attribution performance, closely matching gradient-based
approaches and substantially outperforming existing nonparametric baselines.

TL;DR: CAREBench是一个早期事件预测基准，评估多模态输入下的预测准确性和时间稳定性，发现现有方法特别是LLMs在准确性和稳定性平衡方面表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前早期事件预测系统忽略了风险评分的时间稳定性评估，且主要基于表格数据，缺乏对多模态输入下风险轨迹行为的测试。

Method: 引入CAREBench基准，使用多模态输入（表格EHR、ECG波形、临床文本），提出基于局部Lipschitz常数的稳定性指标来量化短期风险变异性。

Result: 在六个预测任务中，现有方法特别是LLMs难以同时优化准确性和稳定性，在高精度操作点召回率表现较差。

Conclusion: 需要开发能够产生证据对齐、稳定轨迹的模型，以在连续监测环境中赢得临床医生的信任。

Abstract: Early event prediction (EEP) systems continuously estimate a patient's
imminent risk to support clinical decision-making. For bedside trust, risk
trajectories must be accurate and temporally stable, shifting only with new,
relevant evidence. However, current benchmarks (a) ignore stability of risk
scores and (b) evaluate mainly on tabular inputs, leaving trajectory behavior
untested. To address this gap, we introduce CAREBench, an EEP benchmark that
evaluates deployability using multi-modal inputs-tabular EHR, ECG waveforms,
and clinical text-and assesses temporal stability alongside predictive
accuracy. We propose a stability metric that quantifies short-term variability
in per-patient risk and penalizes abrupt oscillations based on local-Lipschitz
constants. CAREBench spans six prediction tasks such as sepsis onset and
compares classical learners, deep sequence models, and zero-shot LLMs. Across
tasks, existing methods, especially LLMs, struggle to jointly optimize accuracy
and stability, with notably poor recall at high-precision operating points.
These results highlight the need for models that produce evidence-aligned,
stable trajectories to earn clinician trust in continuous monitoring settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合谱残差方法和储层计算的SR-RC模型，用于时间序列异常检测，在保持学习效率的同时提高了检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 储层计算在边缘AI应用中具有优势，但单独使用时需要过大的储层才能达到足够的异常检测性能。注意力机制可以改善精度，但可能损害RC的学习效率。

Method: 将谱残差方法（一种无需学习的自底向上注意力机制）与储层计算相结合，提出SR-RC模型。

Result: SR-RC在基准任务和真实世界时间序列数据集上优于传统RC和基于SR方法提取值的逻辑回归模型。

Conclusion: SR-RC为在边缘AI中部署RC进行时间序列异常检测提供了实用方向，因为SR方法同样适合硬件实现。

Abstract: Reservoir computing (RC) establishes the basis for the processing of
time-series data by exploiting the high-dimensional spatiotemporal response of
a recurrent neural network to an input signal. In particular, RC trains only
the output layer weights. This simplicity has drawn attention especially in
Edge Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications. Edge AI enables time-series
anomaly detection in real time, which is important because detection delays can
lead to serious incidents. However, achieving adequate anomaly-detection
performance with RC alone may require an unacceptably large reservoir on
resource-constrained edge devices. Without enlarging the reservoir, attention
mechanisms can improve accuracy, although they may require substantial
computation and undermine the learning efficiency of RC. In this study, to
improve the anomaly detection performance of RC without sacrificing learning
efficiency, we propose a spectral residual RC (SR-RC) that integrates the
spectral residual (SR) method - a learning-free, bottom-up attention mechanism
- with RC. We demonstrated that SR-RC outperformed conventional RC and
logistic-regression models based on values extracted by the SR method across
benchmark tasks and real-world time-series datasets. Moreover, because the SR
method, similarly to RC, is well suited for hardware implementation, SR-RC
suggests a practical direction for deploying RC as Edge AI for time-series
anomaly detection.

*Nam Le,Leo Yu Zhang,Kewen Liao,Shirui Pan,Wei Luo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TED++是一个子流形感知的框架，能够有效检测逃避现有防御的隐蔽后门攻击。它通过构建围绕每个类别隐藏特征流形的管状邻域，并使用局部自适应排名来检测偏离可接受管的激活，从而在自适应攻击和有限数据场景下实现最先进的检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着深度神经网络在关键应用中日益重要，隐蔽的后门攻击（中毒的训练输入触发恶意模型行为，同时看起来良性）构成了严重的安全风险。现有防御在面对攻击者利用微妙距离异常或清洁样本稀缺时容易失效。

Method: TED++首先围绕每个类别的隐藏特征流形构建管状邻域，从少量清洁激活中估计其局部“厚度”。然后应用局部自适应排名(LAR)来检测任何偏离可接受管的激活。通过在所有层上聚合这些LAR调整的排名，TED++捕获输入在演化类别子流形上的忠实程度。

Result: 在基准数据集和任务上的广泛实验表明，TED++在自适应攻击和有限数据场景下实现了最先进的检测性能。即使在每个类别只有五个保留样本的情况下，TED++仍能实现近乎完美的检测，在AUROC上比次优方法提高了14%。

Conclusion: TED++通过其管约束行为特征，能够有效检测隐蔽的后门攻击，特别是在清洁样本稀缺的情况下表现出色，为深度神经网络安全提供了强有力的防御手段。

Abstract: As deep neural networks power increasingly critical applications, stealthy
backdoor attacks, where poisoned training inputs trigger malicious model
behaviour while appearing benign, pose a severe security risk. Many existing
defences are vulnerable when attackers exploit subtle distance-based anomalies
or when clean examples are scarce. To meet this challenge, we introduce TED++,
a submanifold-aware framework that effectively detects subtle backdoors that
evade existing defences. TED++ begins by constructing a tubular neighbourhood
around each class's hidden-feature manifold, estimating its local ``thickness''
from a handful of clean activations. It then applies Locally Adaptive Ranking
(LAR) to detect any activation that drifts outside the admissible tube. By
aggregating these LAR-adjusted ranks across all layers, TED++ captures how
faithfully an input remains on the evolving class submanifolds. Based on such
characteristic ``tube-constrained'' behaviour, TED++ flags inputs whose
LAR-based ranking sequences deviate significantly. Extensive experiments are
conducted on benchmark datasets and tasks, demonstrating that TED++ achieves
state-of-the-art detection performance under both adaptive-attack and
limited-data scenarios. Remarkably, even with only five held-out examples per
class, TED++ still delivers near-perfect detection, achieving gains of up to
14\% in AUROC over the next-best method. The code is publicly available at
https://github.com/namle-w/TEDpp.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了主动可观测马尔可夫决策过程（AOMDP），其中智能体不仅选择控制动作，还决定是否测量潜在状态。测量动作会揭示真实潜在状态，但可能对环境产生负面延迟影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在强化学习中测量状态在现实环境中可能成本高昂，并可能对未来结果产生负面影响。需要一种方法让智能体能够主动选择何时进行状态测量。

Method: 将AOMDP建模为周期性部分可观测MDP，提出基于信念状态的在线RL算法，并使用序列蒙特卡洛方法联合近似未知静态环境参数和未观测潜在状态的后验分布。

Result: 研究表明，尽管存在测量成本，但减少的不确定性可以显著提高样本效率并增加最优策略的价值。

Conclusion: AOMDP框架在数字健康应用中表现良好，智能体能够有效决定何时提供数字干预和何时通过调查评估用户健康状态。

Abstract: Measuring states in reinforcement learning (RL) can be costly in real-world
settings and may negatively influence future outcomes. We introduce the
Actively Observable Markov Decision Process (AOMDP), where an agent not only
selects control actions but also decides whether to measure the latent state.
The measurement action reveals the true latent state but may have a negative
delayed effect on the environment. We show that this reduced uncertainty may
provably improve sample efficiency and increase the value of the optimal policy
despite these costs. We formulate an AOMDP as a periodic partially observable
MDP and propose an online RL algorithm based on belief states. To approximate
the belief states, we further propose a sequential Monte Carlo method to
jointly approximate the posterior of unknown static environment parameters and
unobserved latent states. We evaluate the proposed algorithm in a digital
health application, where the agent decides when to deliver digital
interventions and when to assess users' health status through surveys.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLM-ERM：一种结合LLM引导搜索和经验风险最小化的程序学习框架，在样本效率和计算可行性之间取得平衡，能够用少量样本学习短程序，而基于梯度的训练方法需要指数级更多样本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决程序学习中样本效率和计算可行性之间的权衡问题。传统方法（如程序枚举）计算成本高，而基于梯度的训练在某些短程序家族上需要指数级样本。

Method: 提出LLM-ERM框架：使用预训练推理增强的LLM生成k个候选程序，在保留数据上编译和验证每个程序，选择最佳验证假设，无需反馈、自适应或梯度。

Result: 实证显示LLM-ERM仅用200个样本就能解决奇偶变体、模式匹配和素数测试等任务，而SGD训练的transformer即使使用100,000个样本也会过拟合。

Conclusion: 语言引导的程序合成恢复了有限类ERM的统计效率，同时保持计算可行性，为学习超出梯度训练范围的简洁假设提供了实用途径。

Abstract: We seek algorithms for program learning that are both sample-efficient and
computationally feasible. Classical results show that targets admitting short
program descriptions (e.g., with short ``python code'') can be learned with a
``small'' number of examples (scaling with the size of the code) via
length-first program enumeration, but the search is exponential in description
length. Consequently, Gradient-based training avoids this cost yet can require
exponentially many samples on certain short-program families.
  To address this gap, we introduce LLM-ERM, a propose-and-verify framework
that replaces exhaustive enumeration with an LLM-guided search over candidate
programs while retaining ERM-style selection on held-out data. Specifically, we
draw $k$ candidates with a pretrained reasoning-augmented LLM, compile and
check each on the data, and return the best verified hypothesis, with no
feedback, adaptivity, or gradients. Theoretically, we show that coordinate-wise
online mini-batch SGD requires many samples to learn certain short programs.
{\em Empirically, LLM-ERM solves tasks such as parity variants, pattern
matching, and primality testing with as few as 200 samples, while SGD-trained
transformers overfit even with 100,000 samples}. These results indicate that
language-guided program synthesis recovers much of the statistical efficiency
of finite-class ERM while remaining computationally tractable, offering a
practical route to learning succinct hypotheses beyond the reach of
gradient-based training.

TL;DR: 提出了DARTS-GT，一种通过可微分架构搜索在Transformer注意力中实现深度异构的图Transformer，并开发了首个量化可解释性框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图Transformer设计僵化，缺乏量化可解释性，固定GNN类型限制了性能潜力，复杂架构难以区分有意义的模式和虚假相关性。

Method: 通过非对称注意力设计解耦结构编码和特征表示，使用DARTS为每层选择最优GNN算子，并在Transformer注意力内部实现深度异构。开发了因果消融的量化可解释性框架。

Result: 在8个基准测试中，DARTS-GT在4个数据集上达到最先进水平，其余保持竞争力。发现架构揭示了数据集特定模式，异构架构产生更可解释的模型。

Conclusion: 图Transformer无需在性能和可解释性之间做选择，视觉注意力显著性和因果重要性并不总是相关，可视化方法可能遗漏真正重要的组件。

Abstract: Graph Transformers (GTs) have emerged as powerful architectures for
graph-structured data, yet remain constrained by rigid designs and lack
quantifiable interpretability. Current state-of-the-art GTs commit to fixed GNN
types across all layers, missing potential benefits of depth-specific component
selection, while their complex architectures become opaque where performance
gains cannot be distinguished between meaningful patterns and spurious
correlations. We redesign GT attention through asymmetry, decoupling structural
encoding from feature representation: queries derive from node features while
keys and values come from GNN transformations. Within this framework, we use
Differentiable ARchiTecture Search (DARTS) to select optimal GNN operators at
each layer, enabling depth-wise heterogeneity inside transformer attention
itself (DARTS-GT). To understand discovered architectures, we develop the first
quantitative interpretability framework for GTs through causal ablation. Our
metrics (Head-deviation, Specialization, and Focus), identify which heads and
nodes drive predictions while enabling model comparison. Experiments across
eight benchmarks show DARTS-GT achieves state-of-the-art on four datasets while
remaining competitive on others, with discovered architectures revealing
dataset-specific patterns. Our interpretability analysis reveals that visual
attention salience and causal importance do not always correlate, indicating
widely used visualization approaches may miss components that actually matter.
Crucially, heterogeneous architectures found by DARTS-GT consistently produced
more interpretable models than baselines, establishing that Graph Transformers
need not choose between performance and interpretability.

TL;DR: Stop-RAG是一个基于价值控制的迭代RAG停止策略，将迭代检索建模为有限时域马尔可夫决策过程，自适应决定何时停止检索以提高效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 迭代RAG虽然能回答复杂多跳问题，但每次额外循环都会增加延迟、成本和引入干扰证据的风险，需要高效的停止策略。现有方法要么使用预定迭代次数，要么依赖不能反映检索实际帮助的置信度代理。

Method: 将迭代RAG建模为有限时域马尔可夫决策过程，引入基于价值的控制器Stop-RAG，使用完整轨迹的全宽度前向Q(λ)目标进行训练，兼容黑盒API和现有流程。

Result: 在多跳问答基准测试中，Stop-RAG始终优于固定迭代基线和基于提示的LLM停止方法。

Conclusion: 自适应停止是当前代理系统中的关键缺失组件，基于价值的控制可以显著提高RAG系统的准确性。

Abstract: Iterative retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enables large language models
to answer complex multi-hop questions, but each additional loop increases
latency, costs, and the risk of introducing distracting evidence, motivating
the need for an efficient stopping strategy. Existing methods either use a
predetermined number of iterations or rely on confidence proxies that poorly
reflect whether more retrieval will actually help. We cast iterative RAG as a
finite-horizon Markov decision process and introduce Stop-RAG, a value-based
controller that adaptively decides when to stop retrieving. Trained with
full-width forward-view Q($\lambda$) targets from complete trajectories,
Stop-RAG learns effective stopping policies while remaining compatible with
black-box APIs and existing pipelines. On multi-hop question-answering
benchmarks, Stop-RAG consistently outperforms both fixed-iteration baselines
and prompting-based stopping with LLMs. These results highlight adaptive
stopping as a key missing component in current agentic systems, and demonstrate
that value-based control can improve the accuracy of RAG systems.

Motivation: 为自动微分理论提供几何基础，通过微分几何视角解释AD，为深度学习和科学计算中结构保持的微分方法开发奠定基础。

Method: 使用jet bundles和Weil代数的几何框架，将反向模式AD表述为cotangent-pullback，泰勒模式作为Weil代数中的求值操作。

Result: 推导了反向模式的函子恒等式、高阶导数的代数精确性、截断误差的显式界，并证明张量化Weil代数可以线性成本计算所有混合导数。

Conclusion: 该框架为AD理论提供了微分几何视角，为开发结构保持的微分方法提供了基础，避免了嵌套JVP/VJP调度的组合爆炸问题。

Abstract: We present a geometric formulation of automatic differentiation (AD) using
jet bundles and Weil algebras. Reverse-mode AD emerges as cotangent-pullback,
while Taylor-mode corresponds to evaluation in a Weil algebra. From these
principles, we derive concise statements on correctness, stability, and
complexity: a functorial identity for reverse-mode, algebraic exactness of
higher-order derivatives, and explicit bounds on truncation error. We further
show that tensorized Weil algebras permit one-pass computation of all mixed
derivatives with cost linear in the algebra dimension, avoiding the
combinatorial blow-up of nested JVP/VJP schedules. This framework interprets AD
theory through the lens of differential geometry and offers a foundation for
developing structure-preserving differentiation methods in deep learning and
scientific computing. Code and examples are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM提示优化系统在AI应用中广泛使用，但其优化阶段的安全性研究不足，需要系统评估投毒风险。

Method: 使用HarmBench评估系统脆弱性，引入无需访问奖励模型的假奖励攻击方法，并提出轻量级高亮防御机制。

Result: 反馈攻击显著提升攻击成功率（ΔASR=0.48），假奖励攻击使ΔASR从0.23降至0.07，防御方法有效降低风险且不影响实用性。

Conclusion: 提示优化管道是一类重要攻击面，需要加强对反馈通道和优化框架的安全防护措施。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) systems now underpin everyday AI applications such
as chatbots, computer-use assistants, and autonomous robots, where performance
often depends on carefully designed prompts. LLM-based prompt optimizers reduce
that effort by iteratively refining prompts from scored feedback, yet the
security of this optimization stage remains underexamined. We present the first
systematic analysis of poisoning risks in LLM-based prompt optimization. Using
HarmBench, we find systems are substantially more vulnerable to manipulated
feedback than to injected queries: feedback-based attacks raise attack success
rate (ASR) by up to $\Delta$ASR = 0.48. We introduce a simple fake-reward
attack that requires no access to the reward model and significantly increases
vulnerability, and we propose a lightweight highlighting defense that reduces
the fake-reward $\Delta$ASR from 0.23 to 0.07 without degrading utility. These
results establish prompt optimization pipelines as a first-class attack surface
and motivate stronger safeguards for feedback channels and optimization
frameworks.

TL;DR: 提出了SHaRe-SSM（尖峰谐波共振放电状态空间模型），这是一种用于超长序列建模的乘法自由、节能的尖峰神经网络方法，在保持性能的同时能耗比基于ANN的SSM低73倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 结合尖峰神经网络（SNNs）的节能特性和状态空间模型（SSMs）在长序列建模中的优势，开发一种适用于资源受限应用的超长序列建模方法。

Method: 设计二阶尖峰SSM，利用并行扫描实现动态系统的稳定高效实现，首次提出基于核的尖峰回归器，使用共振放电神经元处理超长序列。

Result: 在18k序列上能耗降低73倍，在50k序列上仍保持优越性能，平均表现优于transformer或一阶SSM。

Conclusion: SHaRe-SSM为资源受限环境下的超长序列建模提供了高效解决方案，同时系统分析了共振放电SSM中异质性、耗散和守恒的影响。

Abstract: In recent years, with the emergence of large models, there has been a
significant interest in spiking neural networks (SNNs) primarily due to their
energy efficiency, multiplication-free, and sparse event-based deep learning.
Similarly, state space models (SSMs) in varying designs have evolved as a
powerful alternative to transformers for target modeling in long sequences,
thereby overcoming the quadratic dependence on sequence length of a
transformer. Inspired by this progress, we here design SHaRe-SSM (Spiking
Harmonic Resonate and Fire State Space Model), for target variable modeling
(including both classification and regression) for very-long-range sequences.
Our second-order spiking SSM, on average, performs better than transformers or
first-order SSMs while circumventing multiplication operations, making it ideal
for resource-constrained applications. The proposed block consumes $73 \times$
less energy than second-order ANN-based SSMs for an 18k sequence, while
retaining performance. To ensure learnability over the long-range sequences, we
propose exploiting the stable and efficient implementation of the dynamical
system using parallel scans. Moreover, for the first time, we propose a
kernel-based spiking regressor using resonate and fire neurons for very
long-range sequences. Our network shows superior performance on even a 50k
sequence while being significantly energy-efficient. In addition, we conducted
a systematic analysis of the impact of heterogeneity, dissipation, and
conservation in resonate-and-fire SSMs.

### [191] [Revisit Modality Imbalance at the Decision Layer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14411)
*Xiaoyu Ma,Hao Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文揭示了多模态学习中不仅存在表示层的不平衡，在决策层也存在显著的不平衡问题。即使经过充分预训练和平衡优化，模型仍会系统性地偏向某些模态（如音频）。这种偏见源于特征空间和决策权重分布的内在差异，而非仅优化动态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态学习通常面临模态不平衡问题，主导模态在联合优化过程中会压制较弱模态。作者发现这种不平衡不仅发生在表示学习阶段，在决策层也显著存在，影响模型的最终性能。

Method: 通过在音频-视觉数据集（CREMAD和Kinetic-Sounds）上进行实验，分析模型在决策层的系统偏见。研究特征空间和决策权重分布的内在差异，而非仅关注优化动态。

Result: 实验表明，即使经过广泛预训练和平衡优化，模型仍然表现出对某些模态（如音频）的系统性偏见。这种偏见源于特征空间和决策权重分布的内在差异。

Conclusion: 未来多模态系统应在决策层引入自适应权重分配机制，根据各模态的能力进行相对平衡的权重分配，而不是简单聚合未校准的模态输出。

Abstract: Multimodal learning integrates information from different modalities to
enhance model performance, yet it often suffers from modality imbalance, where
dominant modalities overshadow weaker ones during joint optimization. This
paper reveals that such an imbalance not only occurs during representation
learning but also manifests significantly at the decision layer. Experiments on
audio-visual datasets (CREMAD and Kinetic-Sounds) show that even after
extensive pretraining and balanced optimization, models still exhibit
systematic bias toward certain modalities, such as audio. Further analysis
demonstrates that this bias originates from intrinsic disparities in
feature-space and decision-weight distributions rather than from optimization
dynamics alone. We argue that aggregating uncalibrated modality outputs at the
fusion stage leads to biased decision-layer weighting, hindering weaker
modalities from contributing effectively. To address this, we propose that
future multimodal systems should focus more on incorporate adaptive weight
allocation mechanisms at the decision layer, enabling relative balanced
according to the capabilities of each modality.

Motivation: 现有的药物-靶点亲和力(DTA)预测评估指标主要关注预测值的准确性，但忽略了交互效应的方向性，而正确捕捉交互方向对于药物分配决策至关重要。

Method: 引入交互一致性指数(IC-index)来评估预测器对交互方向的预测性能，分析预测器在捕获交互效应方面的能力，并通过实证研究验证不同机器学习算法的表现。

Conclusion: IC-index是一个有价值的补充评估指标，能够评估预测器在药物-靶点交互方向预测方面的性能，有助于提高药物分配决策的质量。

Abstract: Consider two sets of entities and their members' mutual affinity values, say
drug-target affinities (DTA). Drugs and targets are said to interact in their
effects on DTAs if drug's effect on it depends on the target. Presence of
interaction implies that assigning a drug to a target and another drug to
another target does not provide the same aggregate DTA as the reversed
assignment would provide. Accordingly, correctly capturing interactions enables
better decision-making, for example, in allocation of limited numbers of drug
doses to their best matching targets. Learning to predict DTAs is popularly
done from either solely from known DTAs or together with side information on
the entities, such as chemical structures of drugs and targets. In this paper,
we introduce interaction directions' prediction performance estimator we call
interaction concordance index (IC-index), for both fixed predictors and machine
learning algorithms aimed for inferring them. IC-index complements the
popularly used DTA prediction performance estimators by evaluating the ratio of
correctly predicted directions of interaction effects in data. First, we show
the invariance of IC-index on predictors unable to capture interactions.
Secondly, we show that learning algorithm's permutation equivariance regarding
drug and target identities implies its inability to capture interactions when
either drug, target or both are unseen during training. In practical
applications, this equivariance is remedied via incorporation of appropriate
side information on drugs and targets. We make a comprehensive empirical
evaluation over several biomedical interaction data sets with various
state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms. The experiments demonstrate how
different types of affinity strength prediction methods perform in terms of
IC-index complementing existing prediction performance estimators.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MoE技术虽然能有效扩展模型规模，但其巨大的内存开销使得模型压缩成为重要研究方向。

Method: 从专家输出合并的角度重新解释专家合并过程，将其视为在正向计算中插入额外矩阵，并基于此提出使用数学优化构建压缩矩阵的MergeMoE方法。

Result: 在多个MoE模型上的评估显示，MergeMoE在相同压缩比下始终优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 从专家输出合并角度分析MoE压缩问题，提出的优化方法能有效提升压缩效果。

Abstract: The Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) technique has proven to be a promising solution
to efficiently scale the model size, which has been widely applied in recent
LLM advancements. However, the substantial memory overhead of MoE models has
made their compression an important research direction. In this work, we
provide a theoretical analysis of expert merging, a recently proposed technique
for compressing MoE models. Rather than interpreting expert merging from the
conventional perspective of parameter aggregation, we approach it from the
perspective of merging experts' outputs. Our key insight is that the merging
process can be interpreted as inserting additional matrices into the forward
computation, which naturally leads to an optimization formulation. Building on
this analysis, we introduce MergeMoE, a method that leverages mathematical
optimization to construct the compression matrices. We evaluate MergeMoE on
multiple MoE models and show that our algorithm consistently outperforms the
baselines with the same compression ratios.

TL;DR: 研究发现，在LLM剪枝后，分别重构transformer块中的attention和MLP组件比完全重训练更有效，既节省资源又提升性能，挑战了避免重训练的传统观念。


<details>

Motivation: 传统LLM剪枝方法避免完全重训练，认为计算成本过高，但作者质疑这种做法的有效性，希望探索剪枝后权重重构的最佳策略。

Method: 在GPT架构上进行广泛计算研究，比较不同重构粒度（单矩阵、组件级、块级）和重构策略，使用简单剪枝标准如Wanda配合适当的重构步骤。

Result: 发现组件级重构（分别重构attention和MLP）在资源效率和困惑度方面达到帕累托最优，性能甚至优于完全重训练，且内存需求大幅降低。

Conclusion: 重构步骤的重要性被低估，简单的剪枝标准配合适当的重构策略可以超越复杂方法，挑战了"不惜一切代价避免重训练"的传统观念。

Abstract: While Neural Network pruning typically requires retraining the model to
recover pruning-induced performance degradation, state-of-the-art Large
Language Models (LLMs) pruning methods instead solve a layer-wise mask
selection and reconstruction problem on a small set of calibration data to
avoid full retraining, as it is considered computationally infeasible for LLMs.
Reconstructing single matrices in isolation has favorable properties, such as
convexity of the objective and significantly reduced memory requirements
compared to full retraining. In practice, however, reconstruction is often
implemented at coarser granularities, e.g., reconstructing a whole transformer
block against its dense activations instead of a single matrix. In this work,
we study the key design choices when reconstructing or retraining the remaining
weights after pruning. We conduct an extensive computational study on
state-of-the-art GPT architectures, and report several surprising findings that
challenge common intuitions about retraining after pruning. In particular, we
observe a free lunch scenario: reconstructing attention and MLP components
separately within each transformer block is nearly the most resource-efficient
yet achieves the best perplexity. Most importantly, this Pareto-optimal setup
achieves better performance than full retraining, despite requiring only a
fraction of the memory. Furthermore, we demonstrate that simple and efficient
pruning criteria such as Wanda can outperform much more complex approaches when
the reconstruction step is properly executed, highlighting its importance. Our
findings challenge the narrative that retraining should be avoided at all costs
and provide important insights into post-pruning performance recovery for LLMs.

Motivation: 当前生成模型方法难以准确再现地质结构特别是河流沉积物的连续性特征，需要开发能够更好捕捉地质细节的生成方法。

Method: 使用生成对抗网络(GAN)训练生成3D河流沉积物图像，以基于过程模型生成的数据作为训练集，通过消融研究验证深度学习技术的可迁移性。

Result: GAN训练稳定，生成的样本能够再现沉积物的非平稳性和细节特征，没有出现模式崩溃或纯粹记忆训练数据的问题，且能够遵循叠加定律。

Conclusion: GAN在针对特定地质结构的训练数据集上表现出比预期更强的鲁棒性，利用地质原理如叠加定律来指导深度生成模型具有很大潜力。

Abstract: The distribution of resources in the subsurface is deeply linked to the
variations of its physical properties. Generative modeling has long been used
to predict those physical properties while quantifying the associated
uncertainty. But current approaches struggle to properly reproduce geological
structures, and fluvial deposits in particular, because of their continuity.
This study explores whether a generative adversarial network (GAN) - a type of
deep-learning algorithm for generative modeling - can be trained to reproduce
fluvial deposits simulated by a process-based model - a more expensive model
that mimics geological processes. An ablation study shows that developments
from the deep-learning community to generate large 2D images are directly
transferable to 3D images of fluvial deposits. Training remains stable, and the
generated samples reproduce the non-stationarity and details of the deposits
without mode collapse or pure memorization of the training data. Using a
process-based model to generate those training data allows us to include
valuable properties other than the usual physical properties. We show how the
deposition time let us monitor and validate the performance of a GAN by
checking that its samples honor the law of superposition. Our work joins a
series of previous studies suggesting that GANs are more robust that given
credit for, at least for training datasets targeting specific geological
structures. Whether this robustness transfers to larger 3D images and
multimodal datasets remains to be seen. Exploring how deep generative models
can leverage geological principles like the law of superposition shows a lot of
promise.

Abstract: Multi-class wine classification presents fundamental trade-offs between model
accuracy, feature dimensionality, and interpretability - critical factors for
production deployment in analytical chemistry. This paper presents a
comprehensive empirical study of One-vs-Rest logistic regression on the UCI
Wine dataset (178 samples, 3 cultivars, 13 chemical features), comparing
from-scratch gradient descent implementation against scikit-learn's optimized
solvers and quantifying L1 regularization effects on feature sparsity. Manual
gradient descent achieves 92.59 percent mean test accuracy with smooth
convergence, validating theoretical foundations, though scikit-learn provides
24x training speedup and 98.15 percent accuracy. Class-specific analysis
reveals distinct chemical signatures with heterogeneous patterns where color
intensity varies dramatically (0.31 to 16.50) across cultivars. L1
regularization produces 54-69 percent feature reduction with only 4.63 percent
accuracy decrease, demonstrating favorable interpretability-performance
trade-offs. We propose an optimal 5-feature subset achieving 62 percent
complexity reduction with estimated 92-94 percent accuracy, enabling
cost-effective deployment with 80 dollars savings per sample and 56 percent
time reduction. Statistical validation confirms robust generalization with
sub-2ms prediction latency suitable for real-time quality control. Our findings
provide actionable guidelines for practitioners balancing comprehensive
chemical analysis against targeted feature measurement in resource-constrained

TL;DR: MECo是一个分子优化框架，通过将编辑操作转化为可执行代码来连接推理和执行，显著提高了分子编辑的准确性和一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型在分子优化中难以忠实执行编辑意图的问题，特别是在处理非直观表示（如SMILES）时。

Method: 采用级联框架：首先生成人类可理解的编辑意图，然后通过代码生成将这些意图转化为可执行的结构编辑。

Result: 在重现化学反应和靶点特异性化合物对的编辑中达到98%以上的准确率，在下游优化基准测试中一致性提高38-86个百分点至90%以上，成功率高于基于SMILES的基线方法。

Conclusion: MECo通过对齐意图与执行，实现了一致、可控和可解释的分子设计，为药物发现中的高保真反馈循环和人机协作工作流程奠定了基础。

Abstract: Molecular optimization is a central task in drug discovery that requires
precise structural reasoning and domain knowledge. While large language models
(LLMs) have shown promise in generating high-level editing intentions in
natural language, they often struggle to faithfully execute these
modifications-particularly when operating on non-intuitive representations like
SMILES. We introduce MECo, a framework that bridges reasoning and execution by
translating editing actions into executable code. MECo reformulates molecular
optimization for LLMs as a cascaded framework: generating human-interpretable
editing intentions from a molecule and property goal, followed by translating
those intentions into executable structural edits via code generation. Our
approach achieves over 98% accuracy in reproducing held-out realistic edits
derived from chemical reactions and target-specific compound pairs. On
downstream optimization benchmarks spanning physicochemical properties and
target activities, MECo substantially improves consistency by 38-86 percentage
points to 90%+ and achieves higher success rates over SMILES-based baselines
while preserving structural similarity. By aligning intention with execution,
MECo enables consistent, controllable and interpretable molecular design,
laying the foundation for high-fidelity feedback loops and collaborative
human-AI workflows in drug discovery.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于上下文近似(ICA)的数据选择和重加权框架，通过在小规模精选holdout集上进行上下文条件化来估计候选训练样本的holdout损失，无需参考模型或额外微调，可有效提升模型对齐效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前微调大型预训练语言模型时，噪声或偏离目标的训练样本会稀释监督信号。虽然小规模精选数据集往往能与大规模数据集性能相当，但系统且高效识别高价值训练数据的方法仍待探索。现有方法多依赖启发式或昂贵的重新训练。

Method: 核心是In-Context Approximation(ICA)，通过在小规模精选holdout集上进行上下文条件化来估计模型在候选样本上训练后的holdout损失。在局部线性化假设下，ICA等价于朝向holdout最优解的一阶更新。基于ICA分数推导每个样本的权重，在模型参数演化时动态重加权梯度更新。

Result: 在SFT、DPO和SimPO等不同训练方法，以及多种骨干网络和数据集上，ICA重加权方法均能一致提升模型对齐效果，且计算开销极小。分析了分数更新频率和holdout示例数量k的影响，指出了在快速漂移的on-policy更新中的局限性。

Conclusion: ICA提供了一种理论上有依据、资源高效的数据选择和重加权框架，能够显著改善模型对齐效果，为未来工作指明了方向。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large pretrained language models is a common approach for
aligning them with human preferences, but noisy or off-target examples can
dilute supervision. While small, well-chosen datasets often match the
performance of much larger ones, systematic and efficient ways to identify
high-value training data remain underexplored. Many current methods rely on
heuristics or expensive retraining. We present a theoretically grounded,
resource-efficient framework for data selection and reweighting. At its core is
an In-Context Approximation (ICA) that estimates the holdout loss a model would
incur after training on a candidate example by conditioning on a small, curated
holdout set in context. ICA requires no reference model and no additional
finetuning. Under a local linearization, ICA is equivalent to a first-order
update toward the holdout optimum, motivating its use as a proxy for data
value. We derive per-example weights from ICA scores, dynamically reweighting
gradient updates as model parameters evolve. Across SFT, DPO, and SimPO, and
over diverse backbones and datasets, ICA-based reweighting consistently
improves model alignment with minimal overhead. We analyze sensitivity to score
update frequency and the choice of $k$ holdout examples for in-context
demonstrations, and note limitations for rapidly drifting on-policy updates,
highlighting directions for future work. Code and prompts will be released.

Motivation: 因果发现算法在样本有限时表现不佳。虽然整合专家知识作为约束有望提升性能，但现有方法需要完美预测或不确定性估计，在实际应用中不可靠。

Method: 提出Guess2Graph框架，使用专家猜测指导统计测试序列而非替代测试。开发了PC-Guess（增强PC算法）和gPC-Guess（学习增强变体，更好地利用高质量专家输入）。

Result: 理论上，两种方法在专家错误时仍保持正确性，当专家优于随机时gPC-Guess在有限样本中证明优于非增强版本。实证上，两者随专家准确性单调提升，gPC-Guess获得显著更强的增益。

Conclusion: Guess2Graph框架通过将专家猜测整合为测试指导而非硬约束，在保持统计一致性的同时实现了性能改进，为有限样本下的因果发现提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Causal discovery algorithms often perform poorly with limited samples. While
integrating expert knowledge (including from LLMs) as constraints promises to
improve performance, guarantees for existing methods require perfect
predictions or uncertainty estimates, making them unreliable for practical use.
We propose the Guess2Graph (G2G) framework, which uses expert guesses to guide
the sequence of statistical tests rather than replacing them. This maintains
statistical consistency while enabling performance improvements. We develop two
instantiations of G2G: PC-Guess, which augments the PC algorithm, and
gPC-Guess, a learning-augmented variant designed to better leverage
high-quality expert input. Theoretically, both preserve correctness regardless
of expert error, with gPC-Guess provably outperforming its non-augmented
counterpart in finite samples when experts are "better than random."
Empirically, both show monotonic improvement with expert accuracy, with
gPC-Guess achieving significantly stronger gains.

Method: 包含两个核心机制：1) Phi(s,a)可逆性度量，量化在固定时间窗口内返回先前状态的可能性；2) 选择性状态回滚操作，当预期回报显著低于瞬时估计值时回滚到前一个状态。

Result: 在CliffWalking v0中减少99.8%的灾难性跌落，平均回合回报提升55%；在Taxi v3中抑制99.9%的非法动作，累积奖励提升65.7%，并显著降低奖励方差。

Conclusion: 回滚机制是实现安全和性能提升的关键组件，为安全可靠的顺序决策提供了稳健的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper proposes a reversible learning framework to improve the robustness
and efficiency of value based Reinforcement Learning agents, addressing
vulnerability to value overestimation and instability in partially irreversible
environments. The framework has two complementary core mechanisms: an
empirically derived transition reversibility measure called Phi of s and a, and
a selective state rollback operation. We introduce an online per state action
estimator called Phi that quantifies the likelihood of returning to a prior
state within a fixed horizon K. This measure is used to adjust the penalty term
during temporal difference updates dynamically, integrating reversibility
awareness directly into the value function. The system also includes a
selective rollback operator. When an action yields an expected return markedly
lower than its instantaneous estimated value and violates a predefined
threshold, the agent is penalized and returns to the preceding state rather
than progressing. This interrupts sub optimal high risk trajectories and avoids
catastrophic steps. By combining reversibility aware evaluation with targeted
rollback, the method improves safety, performance, and stability. In the
CliffWalking v0 domain, the framework reduced catastrophic falls by over 99.8
percent and yielded a 55 percent increase in mean episode return. In the Taxi
v3 domain, it suppressed illegal actions by greater than or equal to 99.9
percent and achieved a 65.7 percent improvement in cumulative reward, while
also sharply reducing reward variance in both environments. Ablation studies
confirm that the rollback mechanism is the critical component underlying these
safety and performance gains, marking a robust step toward safe and reliable
sequential decision making.

Abstract: Time Series Forecasting has made significant progress with the help of
Patching technique, which partitions time series into multiple patches to
effectively retain contextual semantic information into a representation space
beneficial for modeling long-term dependencies. However, conventional patching
partitions a time series into adjacent patches, which causes a fixed
representation space, thus resulting in insufficiently expressful
representations. In this paper, we pioneer the exploration of constructing a
selective representation space to flexibly include the most informative patches
for forecasting. Specifically, we propose the Selective Representation Space
(SRS) module, which utilizes the learnable Selective Patching and Dynamic
Reassembly techniques to adaptively select and shuffle the patches from the
contextual time series, aiming at fully exploiting the information of
contextual time series to enhance the forecasting performance of patch-based
models. To demonstrate the effectiveness of SRS module, we propose a simple yet
effective SRSNet consisting of SRS and an MLP head, which achieves
state-of-the-art performance on real-world datasets from multiple domains.
Furthermore, as a novel plugin-and-play module, SRS can also enhance the
performance of existing patch-based models. The resources are available at

Abstract: Selecting the latent dimensions (ranks) in tensor factorization is a central
challenge that often relies on heuristic methods. This paper introduces a
rigorous approach to determine rank identifiability in probabilistic tensor
models, based on prior predictive moment matching. We transform a set of moment
matching conditions into a log-linear system of equations in terms of marginal
moments, prior hyperparameters, and ranks; establishing an equivalence between
rank identifiability and the solvability of such system. We apply this
framework to four foundational tensor-models, demonstrating that the linear
structure of the PARAFAC/CP model, the chain structure of the Tensor Train
model, and the closed-loop structure of the Tensor Ring model yield solvable
systems, making their ranks identifiable. In contrast, we prove that the
symmetric topology of the Tucker model leads to an underdetermined system,
rendering the ranks unidentifiable by this method. For the identifiable models,
we derive explicit closed-form rank estimators based on the moments of observed
data only. We empirically validate these estimators and evaluate the robustness
of the proposal.

Result: 在14个挑战性数据集上，AEPO一致优于7种主流RL算法。仅用1K RL样本，Qwen3-14B结合AEPO在GAIA上达到47.6%(Pass@1)和65.0%(Pass@5)，在Humanity's Last Exam上达到11.2%(Pass@1)和26.0%(Pass@5)，在WebWalker上达到43.0%(Pass@1)和70.0%(Pass@5)。

Conclusion: AEPO提高了rollout采样多样性，同时保持稳定的策略熵，促进了可扩展的web agent训练。

Abstract: Recently, Agentic Reinforcement Learning (Agentic RL) has made significant
progress in incentivizing the multi-turn, long-horizon tool-use capabilities of
web agents. While mainstream agentic RL algorithms autonomously explore
high-uncertainty tool-call steps under the guidance of entropy, excessive
reliance on entropy signals can impose further constraints, leading to the
training collapse. In this paper, we delve into the challenges caused by
entropy and propose the Agentic Entropy-Balanced Policy Optimization (AEPO), an
agentic RL algorithm designed to balance entropy in both the rollout and policy
update phases. AEPO comprises two core components: (1) a dynamic
entropy-balanced rollout mechanism that adaptively allocate global and branch
sampling budget through entropy pre-monitoring, while imposing a branch penalty
on consecutive high-entropy tool-call steps to prevent over-branching issues;
and (2) Entropy-Balanced Policy Optimization that inserts a stop-gradient
operation into the high-entropy clipping term to preserve and properly rescale
gradients on high-entropy tokens, while incorporating entropy-aware advantage
estimation to prioritize learning on high-uncertainty tokens. Results across 14
challenging datasets show that AEPO consistently outperforms 7 mainstream RL
algorithms. With just 1K RL samples, Qwen3-14B with AEPO achieves impressive
results: 47.6% on GAIA, 11.2% on Humanity's Last Exam, and 43.0% on WebWalker
for Pass@1; 65.0% on GAIA, 26.0% on Humanity's Last Exam, and 70.0% on
WebWalker for Pass@5. Further analysis reveals that AEPO improves rollout
sampling diversity while maintaining stable policy entropy, facilitating
scalable web agent training.

*Jungi Lee,Junyong Park,Soohyun Cha,Jaehoon Cho,Jaewoong Sim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出MX+格式，一种基于块浮点数(BFP)的4位精度扩展，通过重新利用异常值的指数字段作为扩展尾数来提高精度，在保持低存储开销的同时显著提升大语言模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有低精度格式要么需要侵入式软件修改，要么难以在硬件厂商间广泛采用。4位BFP变体由于块内异常值问题导致语言模型性能不佳，需要一种成本效益高且非侵入式的解决方案。

Method: 基于微缩放(MX)格式，提出MX+扩展。关键洞察是异常值不需要使用其元素数据类型中的指数字段，因此可以将指数字段重新用作扩展尾数来提高异常值元素的精度。

Result: MX+相比4位MX格式(MXFP4)实现了显著更高的模型性能，存储开销和速度损失可忽略不计，为高效LLM推理提供了比MXFP4或MXFP6更具吸引力的替代方案。

Conclusion: MX+是一种有效的4位精度格式，通过智能处理异常值问题，在保持低存储开销的同时显著提升大语言模型推理性能，具有实际部署价值。

Abstract: Reduced-precision data formats are crucial for cost-effective serving of
large language models (LLMs). While numerous reduced-precision formats have
been introduced thus far, they often require intrusive modifications to the
software frameworks or are rather unconventional for widespread adoption across
hardware vendors. In this paper, we instead focus on recent industry-driven
variants of block floating-point (BFP) formats and conduct a comprehensive
analysis to push their limits for efficient LLM serving. Our analysis shows
that existing ultra low-bit BFP variants struggle to provide reasonable
language model performance due to outlier values in blocks. To address the
outliers with BFPs, we propose MX+, a cost-effective and non-intrusive
extension designed for seamless integration into the microscaling (MX) formats.
MX+ builds on the key insight that the outlier does not need to use its
exponent field in the element data type, which allows us to repurpose the
exponent field as an extended mantissa to increase the precision of the outlier
element. Our evaluation shows that MX+ achieves significantly higher model
performance compared to the 4-bit MX format (MXFP4) with negligible storage
overhead and slowdown, thus offering a compelling alternative to MXFP4 or MXFP6
for efficient LLM inference.

TL;DR: RedOUT是一个用于图分类的无监督OOD检测框架，通过结构熵减少结构冗余，在真实数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 训练数据和测试数据之间的分布差异导致模型在遇到OOD样本时预测不准确，现有图OOD检测方法受结构冗余影响性能受限。

Method: 提出RedOUT框架，集成结构熵到测试时OOD检测中，引入冗余感知图信息瓶颈(ReGIB)，通过最小化结构熵减少解耦的冗余。

Result: 在真实数据集上的广泛实验显示RedOUT在OOD检测上表现优异，平均提升6.7%，在ClinTox/LIPO数据集对上显著超越最佳竞争对手17.3%。

Conclusion: RedOUT通过结构熵有效减少结构冗余，提高了图分类中OOD检测的性能。

Abstract: Distributional discrepancy between training and test data can lead models to
make inaccurate predictions when encountering out-of-distribution (OOD) samples
in real-world applications. Although existing graph OOD detection methods
leverage data-centric techniques to extract effective representations, their
performance remains compromised by structural redundancy that induces semantic
shifts. To address this dilemma, we propose RedOUT, an unsupervised framework
that integrates structural entropy into test-time OOD detection for graph
classification. Concretely, we introduce the Redundancy-aware Graph Information
Bottleneck (ReGIB) and decompose the objective into essential information and
irrelevant redundancy. By minimizing structural entropy, the decoupled
redundancy is reduced, and theoretically grounded upper and lower bounds are
proposed for optimization. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets
demonstrate the superior performance of RedOUT on OOD detection. Specifically,
our method achieves an average improvement of 6.7%, significantly surpassing
the best competitor by 17.3% on the ClinTox/LIPO dataset pair.

TL;DR: 使用Hydra（双向线性时间结构化状态空间模型）替代TabPFN中的Transformer，以解决Transformer的二次复杂度问题，同时通过双向方法减少对输入顺序的依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer在表格数据中的二次复杂度限制了其效率，而状态空间模型（SSM）虽然效率更高，但对输入顺序敏感，这在行顺序无意义的表格数据中是不利的。

Method: 采用Hydra（双向线性时间SSM）替代TabPFN中的Transformer，通过双向上下文聚合来减少对输入顺序的依赖。

Result: 该方法显著降低了对顺序的依赖性，预测性能与原TabPFN模型相当。

Conclusion: Hydra作为Transformer的替代方案，在保持高效的同时减少了顺序敏感性，为表格数据的基础模型提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Recent advancements in foundation models for tabular data, such as TabPFN,
demonstrated that pretrained Transformer architectures can approximate Bayesian
inference with high predictive performance. However, Transformers suffer from
quadratic complexity with respect to sequence length, motivating the
exploration of more efficient sequence models. In this work, we investigate the
potential of using Hydra, a bidirectional linear-time structured state space
model (SSM), as an alternative to Transformers in TabPFN. A key challenge lies
in SSM's inherent sensitivity to the order of input tokens - an undesirable
property for tabular datasets where the row order is semantically meaningless.
We investigate to what extent a bidirectional approach can preserve efficiency
and enable symmetric context aggregation. Our experiments show that this
approach reduces the order-dependence, achieving predictive performance
competitive to the original TabPFN model.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Conformal Labeling的新方法，通过控制假发现率(FDR)来识别可被证明可信的AI预测标签，解决了AI标注质量不可靠的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI模型虽然能提供成本效益高的标签预测，但其标注质量因不可避免的标注错误而受损。现有方法缺乏对AI分配标签质量的理论保证，导致AI标注子集中的标注错误率往往过高。

Method: 通过比较AI模型预测置信度与校准实例中AI错误标注的置信度，为每个测试实例构建符合性p值，然后选择p值低于数据依赖阈值的测试实例，证明AI预测是可信的。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在图像和文本标注以及LLM问答等多种任务中实现了严格的FDR控制和高功率。

Conclusion: Conformal Labeling方法能够将FDR控制在名义水平以下，确保预定义比例的AI分配标签平均上是正确的，为AI标注提供了理论质量保证。

Abstract: Obtaining high-quality labels for large datasets is expensive, requiring
massive annotations from human experts. While AI models offer a cost-effective
alternative by predicting labels, their label quality is compromised by the
unavoidable labeling errors. Existing methods mitigate this issue through
selective labeling, where AI labels a subset and human labels the remainder.
However, these methods lack theoretical guarantees on the quality of
AI-assigned labels, often resulting in unacceptably high labeling error within
the AI-labeled subset. To address this, we introduce \textbf{Conformal
Labeling}, a novel method to identify instances where AI predictions can be
provably trusted. This is achieved by controlling the false discovery rate
(FDR), the proportion of incorrect labels within the selected subset. In
particular, we construct a conformal $p$-value for each test instance by
comparing AI models' predicted confidence to those of calibration instances
mislabeled by AI models. Then, we select test instances whose $p$-values are
below a data-dependent threshold, certifying AI models' predictions as
trustworthy. We provide theoretical guarantees that Conformal Labeling controls
the FDR below the nominal level, ensuring that a predefined fraction of
AI-assigned labels is correct on average. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method achieves tight FDR control with high power across various
tasks, including image and text labeling, and LLM QA.

Result: 在Astex和PDBbind测试集上表现出优越的对接成功率和物理合理性，比现代大规模共折叠模型快约25倍

Conclusion: Matcha提供了一个高效准确的分子对接解决方案，在速度和准确性方面优于现有方法

Abstract: Accurate prediction of protein-ligand binding poses is crucial for
structure-based drug design, yet existing methods struggle to balance speed,
accuracy, and physical plausibility. We introduce Matcha, a novel molecular
docking pipeline that combines multi-stage flow matching with learned scoring
and physical validity filtering. Our approach consists of three sequential
stages applied consecutively to refine docking predictions, each implemented as
a flow matching model operating on appropriate geometric spaces
($\mathbb{R}^3$, $\mathrm{SO}(3)$, and $\mathrm{SO}(2)$). We enhance the
prediction quality through a dedicated scoring model and apply unsupervised
physical validity filters to eliminate unrealistic poses. Compared to various
approaches, Matcha demonstrates superior performance on Astex and PDBbind test
sets in terms of docking success rate and physical plausibility. Moreover, our
method works approximately 25 times faster than modern large-scale co-folding
models. The model weights and inference code to reproduce our results are

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的RAG系统主要处理单模态文本数据，无法有效处理包含文本、图像、表格、公式和图表等多种模态的非结构化多模态文档。

Method: 提出模态感知混合检索架构(MAHA)，将密集向量检索与结构化图遍历相结合，利用知识图谱编码跨模态语义和关系。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的评估显示，MAHA显著优于基线方法，ROUGE-L得分达到0.486，实现了完整的模态覆盖。

Conclusion: MAHA建立了一个可扩展且可解释的检索框架，通过结合嵌入和显式文档结构，实现了对非结构化多模态数据的模态感知推理，推动了RAG系统的发展。

Abstract: Current Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems primarily operate on
unimodal textual data, limiting their effectiveness on unstructured multimodal
documents. Such documents often combine text, images, tables, equations, and
graphs, each contributing unique information. In this work, we present a
Modality-Aware Hybrid retrieval Architecture (MAHA), designed specifically for
multimodal question answering with reasoning through a modality-aware knowledge
graph. MAHA integrates dense vector retrieval with structured graph traversal,
where the knowledge graph encodes cross-modal semantics and relationships. This
design enables both semantically rich and context-aware retrieval across
diverse modalities. Evaluations on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that
MAHA substantially outperforms baseline methods, achieving a ROUGE-L score of
0.486, providing complete modality coverage. These results highlight MAHA's
ability to combine embeddings with explicit document structure, enabling
effective multimodal retrieval. Our work establishes a scalable and
interpretable retrieval framework that advances RAG systems by enabling
modality-aware reasoning over unstructured multimodal data.

TL;DR: FAL是一种高效的Transformer架构，通过重定向第一层MHA输出到后续层的MLP输入，消除了每块的MHA-MLP连接，减少了通信开销并实现了MHA和MLP在单GPU上的并行执行。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Transformer设计存在显著的通信开销，特别是在张量并行中，每个块的MHA-MLP连接需要all-reduce通信。研究发现MHA-MLP连接可以绕过以提高效率，第一层的注意力输出可以作为替代信号。

Method: 提出FAL架构，将第一层MHA输出重定向到后续层的MLP输入，消除每块的MHA-MLP连接。还提出FAL+，将归一化的第一注意力输出添加到后续层的MHA输出中，以增强MLP输入质量。

Result: FAL将多GPU训练时间减少高达44%，单GPU吞吐量提升1.18倍，并实现比基线GPT更好的困惑度。FAL+在不增加训练时间的情况下实现了更低的困惑度。

Conclusion: FAL和FAL+是高效的Transformer架构，通过消除MHA-MLP连接显著减少了通信开销，同时保持或改进了模型质量。

Abstract: As training billion-scale transformers becomes increasingly common, employing
multiple distributed GPUs along with parallel training methods has become a
standard practice. However, existing transformer designs suffer from
significant communication overhead, especially in Tensor Parallelism (TP),
where each block's MHA-MLP connection requires an all-reduce communication.
Through our investigation, we show that the MHA-MLP connections can be bypassed
for efficiency, while the attention output of the first layer can serve as an
alternative signal for the bypassed connection. Motivated by the observations,
we propose FAL (First Attentions Last), an efficient transformer architecture
that redirects the first MHA output to the MLP inputs of the following layers,
eliminating the per-block MHA-MLP connections. This removes the all-reduce
communication and enables parallel execution of MHA and MLP on a single GPU. We
also introduce FAL+, which adds the normalized first attention output to the
MHA outputs of the following layers to augment the MLP input for the model
quality. Our evaluation shows that FAL reduces multi-GPU training time by up to
44%, improves single-GPU throughput by up to 1.18x, and achieves better
perplexity compared to the baseline GPT. FAL+ achieves even lower perplexity
without increasing the training time than the baseline.

Conclusion: 该方法具有广泛适用性，能够增强科学知识发现和非专家可解释性，为需要人类标注者参与的领域扩展了反事实解释的范围。

Abstract: The growing integration of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence
(AI) models into high-stakes domains such as healthcare and scientific research
calls for models that are not only accurate but also interpretable. Among the
existing explainable methods, counterfactual explanations offer
interpretability by identifying minimal changes to inputs that would alter a
model's prediction, thus providing deeper insights. However, current
counterfactual generation methods suffer from critical limitations, including
gradient vanishing, discontinuous latent spaces, and an overreliance on the
alignment between learned and true decision boundaries. To overcome these
limitations, we propose LeapFactual, a novel counterfactual explanation
algorithm based on conditional flow matching. LeapFactual generates reliable
and informative counterfactuals, even when true and learned decision boundaries
diverge. Following a model-agnostic approach, LeapFactual is not limited to
models with differentiable loss functions. It can even handle human-in-the-loop
systems, expanding the scope of counterfactual explanations to domains that
require the participation of human annotators, such as citizen science. We
provide extensive experiments on benchmark and real-world datasets showing that
LeapFactual generates accurate and in-distribution counterfactual explanations
that offer actionable insights. We observe, for instance, that our reliable
counterfactual samples with labels aligning to ground truth can be beneficially
used as new training data to enhance the model. The proposed method is broadly
applicable and enhances both scientific knowledge discovery and non-expert
interpretability.

Abstract: We address the problem of distribution shift in unsupervised domain
adaptation with a moment-matching approach. Existing methods typically align
low-order statistical moments of the source and target distributions in an
embedding space using ad-hoc similarity measures. We propose a principled
alternative that instead leverages the intrinsic geometry of these
distributions by adopting a Riemannian distance for this alignment. Our key
novelty lies in expressing the first- and second-order moments as a single
symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrix through Siegel embeddings. This
enables simultaneous adaptation of both moments using the natural geometric
distance on the shared manifold of SPD matrices, preserving the mean and
covariance structure of the source and target distributions and yielding a more
faithful metric for cross-domain comparison. We connect the Riemannian manifold
distance to the target-domain error bound, and validate the method on image
denoising and image classification benchmarks. Our code is publicly available
at https://github.com/shayangharib/GeoAdapt.

Abstract: This paper proposes a low-power online anomaly detection framework based on
neuromorphic wireless sensor networks, encompassing possible use cases such as
brain-machine interfaces and remote environmental monitoring. In the considered
system, a central reader node actively queries a subset of neuromorphic sensor
nodes (neuro-SNs) at each time frame. The neuromorphic sensors are
event-driven, producing spikes in correspondence to relevant changes in the
monitored system. The queried neuro-SNs respond to the reader with impulse
radio (IR) transmissions that directly encode the sensed local events. The
reader processes these event-driven signals to determine whether the monitored
environment is in a normal or anomalous state, while rigorously controlling the
false discovery rate (FDR) of detections below a predefined threshold. The
proposed approach employs an online hypothesis testing method with e-values to
maintain FDR control without requiring knowledge of the anomaly rate, and it
dynamically optimizes the sensor querying strategy by casting it as a best-arm
identification problem in a multi-armed bandit framework. Extensive performance
evaluation demonstrates that the proposed method can reliably detect anomalies
under stringent FDR requirements, while efficiently scheduling sensor
communications and achieving low detection latency.

Method: 渐进式参数对齐(FedPPA)，逐步对齐客户端通用层与全局模型权重，结合基于熵的加权平均

Result: 在MNIST、FMNIST和CIFAR-10数据集上，FedPPA优于现有联邦学习算法，在个性化适应方面表现更优

Conclusion: FedPPA能有效缓解客户端更新时全局与局部模型的不一致性，同时保留客户端本地知识，增强非IID环境下的个性化鲁棒性

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is designed as a decentralized, privacy-preserving
machine learning paradigm that enables multiple clients to collaboratively
train a model without sharing their data. In real-world scenarios, however,
clients often have heterogeneous computational resources and hold
non-independent and identically distributed data (non-IID), which poses
significant challenges during training. Personalized Federated Learning (PFL)
has emerged to address these issues by customizing models for each client based
on their unique data distribution. Despite its potential, existing PFL
approaches typically overlook the coexistence of model and data heterogeneity
arising from clients with diverse computational capabilities. To overcome this
limitation, we propose a novel method, called Progressive Parameter Alignment
(FedPPA), which progressively aligns the weights of common layers across
clients with the global model's weights. Our approach not only mitigates
inconsistencies between global and local models during client updates, but also
preserves client's local knowledge, thereby enhancing personalization
robustness in non-IID settings. To further enhance the global model performance
while retaining strong personalization, we also integrate entropy-based
weighted averaging into the FedPPA framework. Experiments on three image
classification datasets, including MNIST, FMNIST, and CIFAR-10, demonstrate
that FedPPA consistently outperforms existing FL algorithms, achieving superior
performance in personalized adaptation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 批大小增加是加速大语言模型预训练的有效策略，但对于自适应优化器如Adam的最优策略尚不明确，通常需要启发式调优。

Method: 开发了批大小调度的原则性框架Seesaw：当标准调度器要减半学习率时，Seesaw将学习率乘以1/√2并加倍批大小。

Result: 在150M/300M/600M参数模型上，Seesaw在相同FLOPs下与余弦衰减匹配，同时减少约36%的墙上时间，接近理论极限。

Conclusion: Seesaw为批大小调度提供了理论依据，在保持训练效果的同时显著加速大语言模型预训练。

Abstract: Increasing the batch size during training -- a ''batch ramp'' -- is a
promising strategy to accelerate large language model pretraining. While for
SGD, doubling the batch size can be equivalent to halving the learning rate,
the optimal strategy for adaptive optimizers like Adam is less clear. As a
result, any batch-ramp scheduling, if used at all, is typically tuned
heuristically. This work develops a principled framework for batch-size
scheduling and introduces Seesaw: whenever a standard scheduler would halve the
learning rate, Seesaw instead multiplies it by $1/\sqrt{2}$ and doubles the
batch size, preserving loss dynamics while reducing serial steps.
Theoretically, we provide, to our knowledge, the first finite-sample proof of
equivalence between learning-rate decay and batch-size ramp-up for SGD on noisy
linear regression, and we extend this equivalence to normalized SGD, a
tractable proxy for Adam, under a variance-dominated regime observed in
practice. Empirically, on 150M/300M/600M-parameter models trained at Chinchilla
scale using a constant (critical) batch size, Seesaw matches cosine decay at
equal FLOPs while reducing wall-clock time by $\approx 36\%$, approaching the
theoretical limit implied by our analysis.

Motivation: 现代GPU具有支持高性能异步数据流执行的专用硬件单元，但传统的SIMT编程模型与这种任务并行硬件存在根本性不匹配，导致显著的可编程性差距。硬件级的warp专业化虽然能解锁峰值性能，但需要开发者手动编排复杂的低级通信和软件管道，这过程劳动密集、容易出错且不可持续。

Method: Tawa采用一种新颖的IR抽象——异步引用(aref)，在不暴露低级硬件细节的情况下表达warp级通信。使用这种抽象，Tawa自动将程序划分为生产者-消费者角色，并管理复杂的数据流管道。

Result: 在NVIDIA H100 GPU上对代表性LLM内核的评估显示，Tawa实现了高硬件利用率，相比高度优化的cuBLAS GEMM内核实现了最高1.1倍的加速。对于注意力工作负载，Tawa相比Triton实现了1.2倍加速，并且与手工优化的CUTLASS C++ FlashAttention-3内核性能相当，但编程工作量大大减少。

Conclusion: Tawa通过自动化编译器方法成功解决了GPU warp专业化编程的复杂性，在保持高性能的同时显著降低了编程负担。

Abstract: Modern GPUs feature specialized hardware units that enable high-performance,
asynchronous dataflow execution. However, the conventional SIMT programming
model is fundamentally misaligned with this task-parallel hardware, creating a
significant programmability gap. While hardware-level warp specialization is
the key to unlocking peak performance, it forces developers to manually
orchestrate complex, low-level communication and software pipelines--a process
that is labor-intensive, error-prone, and unsustainable. To address this
challenge, we present Tawa, an automated compiler that systematically generates
high-performance, warp-specialized code from a high-level, tile-based program.
Central to our approach is a novel IR abstraction, asynchronous references
(aref), which expresses warp-level communication without exposing low-level
hardware details. Using this abstraction, Tawa automatically partitions
programs into producer-consumer roles and manages the intricate dataflow
pipeline, relieving developers of invasive kernel rewriting. Evaluation on
NVIDIA H100 GPUs across representative LLM kernels shows that Tawa delivers
high hardware utilization, achieving up to 1.1$\times$ speedup over highly
optimized cuBLAS GEMM kernels. For attention workloads, Tawa attains
1.2$\times$ speedup over Triton and matches the performance of the
hand-optimized CUTLASS C++ FlashAttention-3 kernel with far less programming
effort.

*Antony Bartlett,Cynthia Liem,Annibale Panichella*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: INDAGO-Nexus是一个多目标搜索方法，用于发现深度强化学习代理的多样化故障场景，相比单目标优化的INDAGO工具，能发现更多独特故障并减少故障发现时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工具如INDAGO仅关注最大化故障数量，无法确保发现的故障场景具有多样性或揭示不同的错误类型。

Method: 使用多目标进化算法，联合优化故障可能性和测试场景多样性，采用多种多样性指标和帕累托前沿选择策略。

Result: 在三个DRL代理（人形行走器、自动驾驶汽车、停车代理）上评估，INDAGO-Nexus在SDC和停车场景中分别比INDAGO多发现83%和40%的独特故障，所有代理的故障发现时间减少高达67%。

Conclusion: INDAGO-Nexus通过多目标优化方法显著提高了测试深度强化学习代理的效果和效率，能够发现更多样化的故障场景。

Abstract: Testing deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agents in safety-critical domains
requires discovering diverse failure scenarios. Existing tools such as INDAGO
rely on single-objective optimization focused solely on maximizing failure
counts, but this does not ensure discovered scenarios are diverse or reveal
distinct error types. We introduce INDAGO-Nexus, a multi-objective search
approach that jointly optimizes for failure likelihood and test scenario
diversity using multi-objective evolutionary algorithms with multiple diversity
metrics and Pareto front selection strategies. We evaluated INDAGO-Nexus on
three DRL agents: humanoid walker, self-driving car, and parking agent. On
average, INDAGO-Nexus discovers up to 83% and 40% more unique failures (test
effectiveness) than INDAGO in the SDC and Parking scenarios, respectively,
while reducing time-to-failure by up to 67% across all agents.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了未来摘要预测（FSP）方法，通过预测长序列的紧凑表示来改进语言模型的长程推理能力，相比传统下一词预测和多词预测在数学、推理和编程任务上表现更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的下一词预测（NTP）在长程推理、规划和创意写作方面存在局限，多词预测（MTP）只能捕捉短程依赖关系，改进有限。需要一种能更好处理长程依赖的训练方法。

Method: 提出未来摘要预测（FSP），训练一个辅助头来预测长序列未来的紧凑表示。探索两种变体：手工制作的摘要（如词袋摘要）和学习的摘要（使用从右到左训练的反向语言模型生成的嵌入）。

Result: 在大规模预训练实验（30亿和80亿参数模型）中，FSP在数学、推理和编程基准测试中相比NTP和MTP都取得了改进。

Conclusion: FSP通过预测未来序列的紧凑表示，有效提升了语言模型的长程推理能力，为长文本生成任务提供了更好的解决方案。

Abstract: Next-token prediction (NTP) has driven the success of large language models
(LLMs), but it struggles with long-horizon reasoning, planning, and creative
writing, with these limitations largely attributed to teacher-forced training.
Multi-token prediction (MTP) partially mitigates these issues by predicting
several future tokens at once, but it mostly captures short-range dependencies
and offers limited improvement. We propose future summary prediction (FSP),
which trains an auxiliary head to predict a compact representation of the
long-term future, preserving information relevant for long-form generations. We
explore two variants of FSP: handcrafted summaries, for example, a bag of words
summary of the future of the sequence, and learned summaries, which use
embeddings produced by a reverse language model trained from right to left.
Large-scale pretraining experiments (3B and 8B-parameter models) demonstrate
that FSP provides improvements over both NTP and MTP across math, reasoning,
and coding benchmarks.

Existing methods assume mutually independent latent confounders or cannot

  We propose a novel algorithm that identifies causal DAGs in LvLiNGAM,
allowing causal structures among latent variables, among observed variables,

experiments with real-world data demonstrate the validity and practical utility

Abstract: We propose an active jammer localization framework that combines Bayesian

Received Signal Strength measurements while accounting for urban obstacles and
mobility constraints. For this, we modified the A* algorithm, A-UCB*, by
incorporating acquisition values into trajectory costs, leading to
high-acquisition planned paths. Simulations on realistic urban scenarios show
that the proposed method achieves accurate localization with fewer measurements
compared to uninformed baselines, demonstrating consistent performance under

TL;DR: SPHeRe是一种新型无监督学习方法，通过整合正交性和结构信息保留来解决传统Hebbian学习的问题，在图像分类、持续学习和迁移学习任务中达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Hebbian学习在机器学习中存在连接更新无约束和缺乏反馈调节的问题，限制了其在复杂网络架构和任务中的有效扩展。

Method: SPHeRe通过局部辅助非线性块整合正交性和结构信息保留，使用轻量级投影进行反馈调节，正交约束控制更新幅度。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和Tiny-ImageNet等标准图像分类基准测试中达到无监督突触可塑性方法的SOTA性能，在持续学习和迁移学习场景中表现优异。

Conclusion: 这项工作证明了Hebbian无监督学习规则在现代深度学习框架中的竞争力和潜力，展示了无需严格依赖反向传播的高效生物启发学习算法的可能性。

Abstract: Hebbian learning is a biological principle that intuitively describes how
neurons adapt their connections through repeated stimuli. However, when applied
to machine learning, it suffers serious issues due to the unconstrained updates
of the connections and the lack of accounting for feedback mediation. Such
shortcomings limit its effective scaling to complex network architectures and
tasks. To this end, here we introduce the Structural Projection Hebbian
Representation (SPHeRe), a novel unsupervised learning method that integrates
orthogonality and structural information preservation through a local auxiliary
nonlinear block. The loss for structural information preservation
backpropagates to the input through an auxiliary lightweight projection that
conceptually serves as feedback mediation while the orthogonality constraints
account for the boundedness of updating magnitude. Extensive experimental
results show that SPHeRe achieves SOTA performance among unsupervised synaptic
plasticity approaches on standard image classification benchmarks, including
CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet. Furthermore, the method exhibits strong
effectiveness in continual learning and transfer learning scenarios, and image
reconstruction tasks show the robustness and generalizability of the extracted
features. This work demonstrates the competitiveness and potential of Hebbian
unsupervised learning rules within modern deep learning frameworks,
demonstrating the possibility of efficient and biologically inspired learning
algorithms without the strong dependence on strict backpropagation. Our code is

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合学习排列矩阵的结构化稀疏训练方法PA-DST，在保持高精度的同时显著提升训练和推理速度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 结构化稀疏虽然能加速GPU上的训练和推理，但在准确率上仍落后于非结构化动态稀疏训练，主要原因是表达能力受限

Method: 为每个层学习一个排列矩阵，与结构化权重矩阵联合训练，应用于块状、N:M和对角线三种典型结构

Result: 在ImageNet-1K和WikiText-103上，PA-DST在90-95%稀疏度下达到与非结构化基线相当的准确率，同时训练速度提升1.21倍，推理速度提升2.9倍

Conclusion: 结构+学习排列的组合在准确率和效率之间找到了最佳平衡点

Abstract: Structured sparsity accelerates training and inference on modern GPUs, yet it
still trails unstructured dynamic sparse training (DST) in accuracy. The
shortfall stems from a loss of expressivity: whereas a dense layer can realize
every possible mask obtained by choosing any $w$ active weights out of $n$, a
fixed block or N:M layout explores only a subset of those possibilities. We
propose to close this gap by learning, for each layer, a single permutation
matrix jointly with the structured weight matrix. Applied to three canonical
structures -- block, N:M, and diagonals -- we show that permutation-augmented
DST (PA-DST) matches unstructured baselines (RigL, SET) at 90--95\% sparsity on
ImageNet-1K (ViT-B/16) and WikiText-103 (GPT-2), yet trains up to $1.21\times$
and infers up to $2.9\times$ faster. The results position structure + learned
permutation as a sweet spot between accuracy and efficiency.

Motivation: 时间序列数据具有动态特性，存在分布偏移问题。现有研究主要关注时间偏移，但对概念漂移的处理关注较少。传统基于不变性学习的概念漂移方法在时间序列预测中面临挑战。

Method: 提出ShifTS框架：1）先处理时间偏移；2）通过软注意力机制从回看和预测时间序列中寻找不变模式来解决概念漂移；3）框架与具体方法无关。

Result: 在多个数据集上的广泛实验表明，ShifTS能持续提升无关模型的预测准确性，优于现有的概念漂移、时间偏移及组合基线方法。

Conclusion: ShifTS框架通过先处理时间偏移再解决概念漂移的统一方法，有效提升了时间序列预测的准确性，为处理时间序列中的分布偏移问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Time-series forecasting finds broad applications in real-world scenarios. Due
to the dynamic nature of time series data, it is important for time-series
forecasting models to handle potential distribution shifts over time. In this
paper, we initially identify two types of distribution shifts in time series:
concept drift and temporal shift. We acknowledge that while existing studies
primarily focus on addressing temporal shift issues in time series forecasting,
designing proper concept drift methods for time series forecasting has received
comparatively less attention.
  Motivated by the need to address potential concept drift, while conventional
concept drift methods via invariant learning face certain challenges in
time-series forecasting, we propose a soft attention mechanism that finds
invariant patterns from both lookback and horizon time series. Additionally, we
emphasize the critical importance of mitigating temporal shifts as a
preliminary to addressing concept drift. In this context, we introduce ShifTS,
a method-agnostic framework designed to tackle temporal shift first and then
concept drift within a unified approach. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
efficacy of ShifTS in consistently enhancing the forecasting accuracy of
agnostic models across multiple datasets, and outperforming existing concept
drift, temporal shift, and combined baselines.

Motivation: 传统监督学习模型依赖特征工程，神经网络能自动学习表示但缺乏可解释性且需要专用硬件。希望找到既能自动学习有用表示又保持可解释性的方法。

Method: 使用LLM合成特征函数（数据点到标量的代码），结合决策树预测器。提出两种算法：FunSearch的改进版本学习特征，以及ID3算法的变体在分裂叶节点时按需生成新特征。

Result: 在象棋位置评估、图像和文本分类等任务中，学习到高质量的无神经网络预测器，性能通常与神经网络相当。

Conclusion: LeaPR提供了一个灵活的学习可解释表示的范式，特征和预测都可以被直接检查和理解。

Abstract: Classical models for supervised machine learning, such as decision trees, are
efficient and interpretable predictors, but their quality is highly dependent
on the particular choice of input features. Although neural networks can learn
useful representations directly from raw data (e.g., images or text), this
comes at the expense of interpretability and the need for specialized hardware
to run them efficiently. In this paper, we explore a hypothesis class we call
Learned Programmatic Representations (LeaPR) models, which stack arbitrary
features represented as code (functions from data points to scalars) and
decision tree predictors. We synthesize feature functions using Large Language
Models (LLMs), which have rich prior knowledge in a wide range of domains and a
remarkable ability to write code using existing domain-specific libraries. We
propose two algorithms to learn LeaPR models from supervised data. First, we
design an adaptation of FunSearch to learn features rather than directly
generate predictors. Then, we develop a novel variant of the classical ID3
algorithm for decision tree learning, where new features are generated on
demand when splitting leaf nodes. In experiments from chess position evaluation
to image and text classification, our methods learn high-quality, neural
network-free predictors often competitive with neural networks. Our work
suggests a flexible paradigm for learning interpretable representations
end-to-end where features and predictions can be readily inspected and
understood.

Method: 通过理论分析证明SSMs的局限性，然后引入工具交互机制，结合问题相关的训练数据来增强SSMs的能力。

Result: 工具增强的SSMs在算术、推理和编程任务上实现了显著的序列长度泛化能力。

Conclusion: SSMs结合工具交互可以成为Transformer在交互式工具场景中的高效替代方案。

Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs) have become the leading alternative to Transformers
for sequence modeling. Their primary advantage is efficiency in long-context
and long-form generation, enabled by fixed-size memory and linear scaling of
computational complexity. We begin this work by showing a simple theoretical
result stating that SSMs cannot accurately solve any ``truly long-form''
generation problem (in a sense we formally define), undermining their main
competitive advantage. However, we show that this limitation can be mitigated
by allowing SSMs interactive access to external tools. In fact, we show that
given the right choice of tool access and problem-dependent training data, SSMs
can learn to solve any tractable problem and generalize to arbitrary problem
length/complexity (i.e., achieve length generalization). Following our
theoretical finding, we demonstrate that tool-augmented SSMs achieve remarkable
length generalization on a variety of arithmetic, reasoning, and coding tasks.
These findings highlight SSMs as a potential efficient alternative to
Transformers in interactive tool-based and agentic settings.

Abstract: The emerging paradigm of 6G multiple Radio Access Technology (multi-RAT)
networks, where cellular and Wireless Fidelity (WiFi) transmitters coexist,
requires mobility decisions that remain reliable under fast channel dynamics,
interference, and heterogeneous coverage. Handover in multi-RAT deployments is
still highly reactive and event-triggered, relying on instantaneous
measurements and threshold events. This work proposes a Machine Learning
(ML)-assisted Predictive Conditional Handover (P-CHO) framework based on a
model-driven and short-horizon signal quality forecasts. We present a
generalized P-CHO sequence workflow orchestrated by a RAT Steering Controller,
which standardizes data collection, parallel per-RAT predictions, decision
logic with hysteresis-based conditions, and CHO execution. Considering a
realistic multi-RAT environment, we train RAT-aware Long Short Term Memory
(LSTM) networks to forecast the signal quality indicators of mobile users along
randomized trajectories. The proposed P-CHO models are trained and evaluated
under different channel models for cellular and IEEE 802.11 WiFi integrated
coverage. We study the impact of hyperparameter tuning of LSTM models under
different system settings, and compare direct multi-step versus recursive P-CHO
variants. Comparisons against baseline predictors are also carried out.
Finally, the proposed P-CHO is tested under soft and hard handover settings,
showing that hysteresis-enabled P-CHO scheme is able to reduce handover
failures and ping-pong events. Overall, the proposed P-CHO framework can enable
accurate, low-latency, and proactive handovers suitable for ML-assisted
handover steering in 6G multi-RAT deployments.

Abstract: Reward machines are an established tool for dealing with reinforcement
learning problems in which rewards are sparse and depend on complex sequences
of actions. However, existing algorithms for learning reward machines assume an
overly idealized setting where rewards have to be free of noise. To overcome
this practical limitation, we introduce a novel type of reward machines, called
stochastic reward machines, and an algorithm for learning them. Our algorithm,
based on constraint solving, learns minimal stochastic reward machines from the
explorations of a reinforcement learning agent. This algorithm can easily be
paired with existing reinforcement learning algorithms for reward machines and
guarantees to converge to an optimal policy in the limit. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our algorithm in two case studies and show that it outperforms
both existing methods and a naive approach for handling noisy reward functions.

Abstract: Machine Unlearning aims to remove specific data from trained models,
addressing growing privacy and ethical concerns. We provide a theoretical
analysis of a simple and widely used method - gradient ascent - used to reverse
the influence of a specific data point without retraining from scratch.
Leveraging the implicit bias of gradient descent towards solutions that satisfy
the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions of a margin maximization problem, we
quantify the quality of the unlearned model by evaluating how well it satisfies
these conditions w.r.t. the retained data. To formalize this idea, we propose a
new success criterion, termed \textbf{$(\epsilon, \delta, \tau)$-successful}
unlearning, and show that, for both linear models and two-layer neural networks
with high dimensional data, a properly scaled gradient-ascent step satisfies
this criterion and yields a model that closely approximates the retrained
solution on the retained data. We also show that gradient ascent performs
successful unlearning while still preserving generalization in a synthetic
Gaussian-mixture setting.

Motivation: 基础模型虽然具有广泛泛化能力，但容易受到对抗性扰动和后门攻击。现有防御方法需要昂贵的微调，且会降低模型在其他任务上的性能。本文研究是否能在不影响模型通用能力的前提下移除后门。

Method: 研究发现后门在模型权重空间中与良性任务是解耦的。基于这一发现，提出了一种简单的遗忘方法，通过分离和擦除后门影响来实现选择性遗忘，即使攻击未知时也能通过逆向工程触发来估计并移除后门。

Result: 在CLIP模型和常见对抗触发器的实验中，该方法实现了近乎完美的遗忘效果，同时平均保持了96%的干净准确率。与现有最先进防御方法相比，在遗忘效果和干净准确率之间取得了更好的平衡。

Conclusion: 后门在基础模型权重空间中的解耦特性使得无需重新训练即可有效移除后门，同时保持模型在其他任务上的性能，为解决基础模型安全漏洞提供了新思路。

Abstract: Foundation models have revolutionized computer vision by enabling broad
generalization across diverse tasks. Yet, they remain highly susceptible to
adversarial perturbations and targeted backdoor attacks. Mitigating such
vulnerabilities remains an open challenge, especially given that the
large-scale nature of the models prohibits retraining to ensure safety.
Existing backdoor removal approaches rely on costly fine-tuning to override the
harmful behavior, and can often degrade performance on other unrelated tasks.
This raises the question of whether backdoors can be removed without
compromising the general capabilities of the models. In this work, we address
this question and study how backdoors are encoded in the model weight space,
finding that they are disentangled from other benign tasks. Specifically, this
separation enables the isolation and erasure of the backdoor's influence on the
model with minimal impact on clean performance. Building on this insight, we
introduce a simple unlearning method that leverages such disentanglement.
Through extensive experiments with CLIP-based models and common adversarial
triggers, we show that, given the knowledge of the attack, our method achieves
approximately perfect unlearning, while retaining, on average, 96% of clean
accuracy. Additionally, we demonstrate that even when the attack and its
presence are unknown, our method successfully unlearns backdoors by proper
estimation using reverse-engineered triggers. Overall, our method consistently
yields better unlearning and clean accuracy tradeoffs when compared to present
state-of-the-art defenses.

Abstract: We study kernel regression with common rotation-invariant kernels on real
datasets including CIFAR-5m, SVHN, and ImageNet. We give a theoretical
framework that predicts learning curves (test risk vs. sample size) from only
two measurements: the empirical data covariance matrix and an empirical
polynomial decomposition of the target function $f_*$. The key new idea is an
analytical approximation of a kernel's eigenvalues and eigenfunctions with
respect to an anisotropic data distribution. The eigenfunctions resemble
Hermite polynomials of the data, so we call this approximation the Hermite
eigenstructure ansatz (HEA). We prove the HEA for Gaussian data, but we find
that real image data is often "Gaussian enough" for the HEA to hold well in
practice, enabling us to predict learning curves by applying prior results
relating kernel eigenstructure to test risk. Extending beyond kernel
regression, we empirically find that MLPs in the feature-learning regime learn
Hermite polynomials in the order predicted by the HEA. Our HEA framework is a
proof of concept that an end-to-end theory of learning which maps dataset
structure all the way to model performance is possible for nontrivial learning
algorithms on real datasets.

Conclusion: 谨慎探索策略能够在无导师情况下安全地学习，为高风险环境中的AI部署提供了理论保障。

Abstract: In high-stakes AI applications, even a single action can cause irreparable
damage. However, nearly all of sequential decision-making theory assumes that
all errors are recoverable (e.g., by bounding rewards). Standard bandit
algorithms that explore aggressively may cause irreparable damage when this
assumption fails. Some prior work avoids irreparable errors by asking for help
from a mentor, but a mentor may not always be available. In this work, we
formalize a model of learning with unbounded rewards without a mentor as a
two-action contextual bandit with an abstain option: at each round the agent
observes an input and chooses either to abstain (always 0 reward) or to commit
(execute a preexisting task policy). Committing yields rewards that are
upper-bounded but can be arbitrarily negative, and the commit reward is assumed
Lipschitz in the input. We propose a caution-based algorithm that learns when
not to learn: it chooses a trusted region and commits only where the available
evidence does not already certify harm. Under these conditions and i.i.d.
inputs, we establish sublinear regret guarantees, theoretically demonstrating
the effectiveness of cautious exploration for deploying learning agents safely
in high-stakes environments.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种无需额外训练的推理方法，通过纯采样在推理时从基础模型中激发推理能力，性能接近甚至超过RL后训练方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究是否可以在不进行额外训练的情况下，仅通过采样方法从基础模型中激发与RL后训练相当的推理能力。

Method: 受马尔可夫链蒙特卡洛技术启发，提出了一种简单的迭代采样算法，利用基础模型自身的似然性。

Result: 在MATH500、HumanEval和GPQA等单次任务上，该方法显著提升了推理能力，性能接近甚至超过RL后训练，同时避免了RL方法中多样性的崩溃问题。

Conclusion: 该方法无需训练、精选数据集或验证器，具有广泛的适用性，特别是在难以验证的领域。

Abstract: Frontier reasoning models have exhibited incredible capabilities across a
wide array of disciplines, driven by posttraining large language models (LLMs)
with reinforcement learning (RL). However, despite the widespread success of
this paradigm, much of the literature has been devoted to disentangling truly
novel behaviors that emerge during RL but are not present in the base models.
In our work, we approach this question from a different angle, instead asking
whether comparable reasoning capabilites can be elicited from base models at
inference time by pure sampling, without any additional training. Inspired by
Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques for sampling from sharpened
distributions, we propose a simple iterative sampling algorithm leveraging the
base models' own likelihoods. Over different base models, we show that our
algorithm offers substantial boosts in reasoning that nearly match and even
outperform those from RL on a wide variety of single-shot tasks, including
MATH500, HumanEval, and GPQA. Moreover, our sampler avoids the collapse in
diversity over multiple samples that is characteristic of RL-posttraining.
Crucially, our method does not require training, curated datasets, or a
verifier, suggesting broad applicability beyond easily verifiable domains.

TL;DR: 提出了WeightLens和CircuitLens两种互补方法，通过直接分析权重和特征交互来增强神经网络的可解释性，超越传统的基于激活的分析方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有可解释性方法依赖人工检查且仅限于简单任务，自动化方法虽然可扩展但容易忽略特征间的交互，且依赖外部LLM和数据集质量。

Method: WeightLens直接从学习到的权重解释特征，无需解释模型或数据集；CircuitLens捕捉特征激活如何从组件交互中产生，揭示电路级动态。

Result: WeightLens在上下文无关特征上匹配或超越现有方法性能；CircuitLens识别出仅基于激活的方法无法发现的电路级动态。

Conclusion: 这两种方法提高了可解释性的鲁棒性，增强了电路的可扩展机制分析，同时保持了效率和质量。

Abstract: The fields of explainable AI and mechanistic interpretability aim to uncover
the internal structure of neural networks, with circuit discovery as a central
tool for understanding model computations. Existing approaches, however, rely
on manual inspection and remain limited to toy tasks. Automated
interpretability offers scalability by analyzing isolated features and their
activations, but it often misses interactions between features and depends
strongly on external LLMs and dataset quality. Transcoders have recently made
it possible to separate feature attributions into input-dependent and
input-invariant components, providing a foundation for more systematic circuit
analysis. Building on this, we propose WeightLens and CircuitLens, two
complementary methods that go beyond activation-based analysis. WeightLens
interprets features directly from their learned weights, removing the need for
explainer models or datasets while matching or exceeding the performance of
existing methods on context-independent features. CircuitLens captures how
feature activations arise from interactions between components, revealing
circuit-level dynamics that activation-only approaches cannot identify.
Together, these methods increase interpretability robustness and enhance
scalable mechanistic analysis of circuits while maintaining efficiency and
quality.

Motivation: 探索循环深度模型与扩散语言模型之间的关系，利用它们的相似性来加速循环深度模型的推理生成过程。

Method: 开发了一种扩散强迫采样器，在每个前向传递中解码新token，同时通过循环并行细化这些token的潜在状态。

Result: 该采样器可直接应用于现有的35亿参数循环深度transformer，无需调参即可实现高达5倍的加速。

Conclusion: 不仅为循环深度模型提供了高效的并行推理机制，还表明这类模型可自然地视为强大的连续因果扩散语言模型。

Abstract: Language models with recurrent depth, also referred to as universal or looped
when considering transformers, are defined by the capacity to increase their
computation through the repetition of layers. Recent efforts in pretraining
have demonstrated that these architectures can scale to modern language
modeling tasks while exhibiting advantages in reasoning tasks. In this work, we
examine the relationship between recurrent-depth models and diffusion language
models. Building on their similarities, we develop a new diffusion forcing
sampler for these models to accelerate generation. The sampler advances by
decoding new tokens at every forward pass of the model, while the latent states
of these tokens can be further refined in parallel through recurrence.
Theoretically, generation with our sampler is strictly more expressive than the
baseline autoregressive generation using the same time budget on modern
hardware. Moreover, this sampler, based on principles from diffusion
literature, can be directly applied to existing 3.5B recurrent-depth
transformers without any tuning, leading to up to a 5x speedup. Consequently,
our findings not only provide an efficient mechanism for parallelizing the
extra computation in recurrent-depth models at inference, but also suggest that
such models can be naturally viewed as strong continuous, though causal,
diffusion language models.

*Zachary Robertson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出使用恒等链接函数（identity link）的IRT模型来评估大语言模型，相比传统的logit/probit链接函数能更好地保持TVD-MI比较数据的加性结构，减少曲率违反，实现更高效的模型评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统IRT模型使用logistic链接函数会引入曲率，破坏TVD-MI比较数据的加性结构，导致评估效率降低。需要找到更适合TVD-MI几何特性的链接函数。

Method: 使用恒等链接函数的IRT模型，从Gini熵最大化推导出剪裁线性模型，采用盒约束最小二乘公式处理边界饱和问题。

Result: 在33%覆盖率下，获得留一法RMSE为0.117±0.008，同时保持代理排名（Spearman ρ=0.972±0.015），评估次数比全密集评估减少三倍。不同评判者间代理排名一致性高（ρ=0.872）。

Conclusion: 恒等映射能最好地保持TVD-MI的几何特性，为大语言模型评估提供高效方法，也适用于其他有界响应领域。

Abstract: Pairwise comparisons of large language models using total variation distance
mutual information (TVD-MI) produce binary critic decisions per pair. We show
that averaging TVD-MI's binary trials yields centered-probability scores with
additive structure suitable for item-response theory (IRT) without nonlinear
link functions. Maximum-likelihood approaches to IRT use logistic links, but we
find empirically that these transformations introduce curvature that breaks
additivity: across three domains, the identity link yields median curl on raw
data of 0.080-0.150 (P95 = [0.474, 0.580]), whereas probit/logit introduce
substantially higher violations (median [0.245, 0.588], P95 [0.825, 2.252]). We
derive this clipped-linear model from Gini entropy maximization, yielding a
box-constrained least-squares formulation that handles boundary saturation. At
33% coverage, we achieve holdout RMSE $0.117 \pm 0.008$ while preserving agent
rankings (Spearman $\rho = 0.972 \pm 0.015$), three times fewer evaluations
than full dense. Judge robustness analysis (GPT-4o-mini vs. Llama3-70b) shows
strong agreement in agent rankings ($\rho = 0.872$) and consistent
identity-link advantage. TVD-MI's geometry is best preserved by identity
mapping for efficient LLM evaluation, applicable to other bounded-response
domains.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文扩展了生物信息神经网络(BINNs)在作物基因组预测和选择中的应用，通过整合数千个SNPs与多组学数据及先验生物知识，提高了预测准确性并揭示了非线性生物关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基因型到表型(G2P)模型依赖直接映射，准确性有限，育种者需进行大规模昂贵的田间试验。现有模型虽能利用中间分子表型提高预测拟合度，但在基因组选择部署时这些数据不可用。

Method: BINNs通过编码通路级归纳偏置，在训练时利用多组学数据，在推理时仅使用基因型数据。应用于玉米基因表达和多环境田间试验数据，并在合成代谢组学基准测试中验证。

Result: BINNs在稀疏数据条件下将排名相关准确性提高达56%，非线性识别GWAS/TWAS未能发现的基因。在合成基准测试中，相比传统神经网络将预测误差降低75%，并正确识别最重要的非线性通路。

Conclusion: BINNs建立了利用中间领域信息提高基因组预测准确性的框架，揭示了可指导基因组选择、候选基因选择、通路富集和基因编辑优先级的非线性生物关系。

Abstract: We extend biologically-informed neural networks (BINNs) for genomic
prediction (GP) and selection (GS) in crops by integrating thousands of
single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with multi-omics measurements and prior
biological knowledge. Traditional genotype-to-phenotype (G2P) models depend
heavily on direct mappings that achieve only modest accuracy, forcing breeders
to conduct large, costly field trials to maintain or marginally improve genetic
gain. Models that incorporate intermediate molecular phenotypes such as gene
expression can achieve higher predictive fit, but they remain impractical for
GS since such data are unavailable at deployment or design time. BINNs overcome
this limitation by encoding pathway-level inductive biases and leveraging
multi-omics data only during training, while using genotype data alone during
inference. Applied to maize gene-expression and multi-environment field-trial
data, BINN improves rank-correlation accuracy by up to 56% within and across
subpopulations under sparse-data conditions and nonlinearly identifies genes
that GWAS/TWAS fail to uncover. With complete domain knowledge for a synthetic
metabolomics benchmark, BINN reduces prediction error by 75% relative to
conventional neural nets and correctly identifies the most important nonlinear
pathway. Importantly, both cases show highly sensitive BINN latent variables
correlate with the experimental quantities they represent, despite not being
trained on them. This suggests BINNs learn biologically-relevant
representations, nonlinear or linear, from genotype to phenotype. Together,
BINNs establish a framework that leverages intermediate domain information to
improve genomic prediction accuracy and reveal nonlinear biological
relationships that can guide genomic selection, candidate gene selection,
pathway enrichment, and gene-editing prioritization.

TL;DR: π-Flow是一种基于策略的流模型，通过修改学生模型的输出层来预测网络无关的策略，实现快速准确的ODE积分，避免了传统蒸馏方法中的质量-多样性权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的少步扩散或流模型蒸馏方法存在格式不匹配问题，导致复杂的蒸馏过程往往面临质量与多样性之间的权衡困境。

Method: 提出策略流模型(π-Flow)，修改学生流模型的输出层来预测单时间步的网络无关策略，该策略能在未来子步产生动态流速度，无需额外网络评估即可实现快速ODE积分。采用模仿蒸馏方法，使用标准ℓ2流匹配损失使策略速度与教师模型在策略轨迹上保持一致。

Result: 在ImageNet 256²上达到1-NFE FID 2.85，优于相同DiT架构的MeanFlow。在FLUX.1-12B和Qwen-Image-20B上，4 NFEs时实现了比最先进少步方法更好的多样性，同时保持教师级别的质量。

Conclusion: π-Flow通过简单模仿教师行为，实现了稳定可扩展的训练，避免了质量-多样性权衡问题，在少步生成任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Few-step diffusion or flow-based generative models typically distill a
velocity-predicting teacher into a student that predicts a shortcut towards
denoised data. This format mismatch has led to complex distillation procedures
that often suffer from a quality-diversity trade-off. To address this, we
propose policy-based flow models ($\pi$-Flow). $\pi$-Flow modifies the output
layer of a student flow model to predict a network-free policy at one timestep.
The policy then produces dynamic flow velocities at future substeps with
negligible overhead, enabling fast and accurate ODE integration on these
substeps without extra network evaluations. To match the policy's ODE
trajectory to the teacher's, we introduce a novel imitation distillation
approach, which matches the policy's velocity to the teacher's along the
policy's trajectory using a standard $\ell_2$ flow matching loss. By simply
mimicking the teacher's behavior, $\pi$-Flow enables stable and scalable
training and avoids the quality-diversity trade-off. On ImageNet 256$^2$, it
attains a 1-NFE FID of 2.85, outperforming MeanFlow of the same DiT
architecture. On FLUX.1-12B and Qwen-Image-20B at 4 NFEs, $\pi$-Flow achieves
substantially better diversity than state-of-the-art few-step methods, while
maintaining teacher-level quality.
