Second-order pruning methods, such as Optimal Brain\nDamage (OBD) and its variants, including Optimal Brain Surgeon (OBS) and the\nrecent SparseGPT, compress networks in a single pass by leveraging the local\nHessian, achieving far higher sparsity than magnitude thresholding. Despite\ntheir success in vision and language, the consequences of such weight removal\non closed-loop stability, tracking accuracy, and safety have remained unclear.\nWe present the first mathematically rigorous robustness analysis of\nsecond-order pruning in nonlinear discrete-time control. The system evolves\nunder a continuous transition map, while the controller is an $L$-layer\nmultilayer perceptron with ReLU-type activations that are globally 1-Lipschitz.\nPruning the weight matrix of layer $k$ replaces $W_k$ with $W_k+\\delta W_k$,\nproducing the perturbed parameter vector $\\widehat{\\Theta}=\\Theta+\\delta\\Theta$\nand the pruned policy $\\pi(\\cdot;\\widehat{\\Theta})$.

To surgically eliminate redundant operations while preserving\ncritical ones, we propose Greedily Sorted Operation Pruning (GSOP), a\ndata-driven method that directly prunes operations rather than tokens. GSOP\nfirst decomposes a VLM decoder's computations into atomic operations along\nthree dimensions: token groups, layer positions, and computation modules.

However, as these\nmodels scale to longer video sequences and richer language descriptions, the\nquadratic complexity of the standard attention mechanism presents a fundamental\ncomputational bottleneck. This challenge is exacerbated in vLLMs, where\nattention must be computed not only within modalities but also across them,\nleading to prohibitive memory and latency costs. In this work, we introduce the\nCompressed Sensing Attention Transformer (CSAT), a novel architecture that\nreimagines attention computation through the lens of compressed sensing. By\nprojecting high dimensional key and value representations into a\nlower-dimensional subspace via random measurement matrices and reconstructing\nthe attention outputs using sparse recovery algorithms, CSAT significantly\nreduces attention complexity while maintaining semantic fidelity. Applied to\nvLLMs, CSAT exploits the inherent compressibility of both visual and textual\nrepresentations especially evident in video, where temporal redundancy is high,\nand in language, where cross-modal grounding is often sparse. In contrast to\nLLMs, which must often model entangled symbolic dependencies, vLLMs benefit\nfrom structured sparsity in alignment and scene composition, making them\nparticularly well-suited to compressed attention. We provide a formal\nmathematical treatment of CSAT, demonstrate its integration into vision\nlanguage pipelines, and validate its performance on standard benchmarks,\nhighlighting its promise as a scalable, interpretable, and resource efficient\nsolution for next generation multimodal transformers."}

Furthermore,\nsequential data processing with Transformers encounters a fundamental barrier:\nquadratic complexity growth with sequence length. Motivated by these\nlimitations, our ambition is to create more efficient models that are less\nreliant on intensive computations and massive volumes of data. We introduce\nEcho State Transformers (EST), a hybrid architecture that elegantly resolves\nthis challenge while demonstrating exceptional performance in low-data regimes.\nEST integrates the Transformer attention mechanisms with principles from\nReservoir Computing to create a fixedsize window distributed memory system.\nDrawing inspiration from Echo State Networks, the most prominent instance of\nthe Reservoir Computing paradigm, our architecture integrates a new module\ncalled ''Working Memory'' based on several reservoirs (i.e. random recurrent\nnetworks) working in parallel. These reservoirs work as independent memory\nunits with distinct internal dynamics. A novelty here is that the classical\nreservoir hyperparameters controlling the dynamics are now trained. Thus, the\nEST dynamically adapts the memory/non-linearity trade-off in reservoirs. By\nmaintaining a fixed number of memory units regardless of sequence length, EST\nachieves constant computational complexity at each processing step, effectively\nbreaking the quadratic scaling problem of standard Transformers. Evaluations on\nthe STREAM benchmark, which comprises 12 diverse sequential processing tasks,\ndemonstrate that EST outperforms GRUs, LSTMs, and even Transformers on 8 of\nthese tasks.

For\na chosen class of graphs, if a well-tailored graph encoder is deployed to play\ntogether with a pre-trained LLM, the model can answer graph-related questions\nwell. Existing solutions to graph-based prompts range from graph serialization\nto graph transformers. In this work, we show that the use of a parameter-free\ngraph encoder based on Fock space representations, a concept borrowed from\nmathematical physics, is remarkably versatile in this problem setting. The\nsimple construction, inherited directly from the theory with a few small\nadjustments, can provide rich and informative graph encodings, for a wide range\nof different graphs. We investigate the use of this idea for prefix-tuned\nprompts leveraging the capabilities of a pre-trained, frozen LLM. The\nmodifications lead to a model that can answer graph-related questions -- from\nsimple graphs to proteins to hypergraphs -- effectively and with minimal, if\nany, adjustments to the architecture.

Recent\nadvancements have introduced different lidar types, including cost-effective\nsolid-state lidars such as the Livox Avia and Mid-360. The Mid-360, with its\ndome-like design, is increasingly used in portable mapping and unmanned aerial\nvehicle (UAV) applications due to its low cost, compact size, and reliable\nperformance. However, the lack of datasets that include dome-shaped lidars,\nsuch as the Mid-360, alongside other solid-state and spinning lidars\nsignificantly hinders the comparative evaluation of novel approaches across\nplatforms. Additionally, performance differences between low-cost solid-state\nand high-end spinning lidars (e.g., Ouster OS series) remain insufficiently\nexamined, particularly without an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) in odometry.\n  To address this gap, we introduce a novel dataset comprising data from\nmultiple lidar types, including the low-cost Livox Avia and the dome-shaped\nMid-360, as well as high-end spinning lidars such as the Ouster series.\nNotably, to the best of our knowledge, no existing dataset comprehensively\nincludes dome-shaped lidars such as Mid-360 alongside both other solid-state\nand spinning lidars.

Existing research commonly attributes\nhallucinations to technical limitations or sycophancy bias, where the latter\nmeans the models tend to generate incorrect answers to align with user\nexpectations. However, these explanations primarily focus on technical or\nexternally driven factors, may have neglected the possibility that\nhallucination behaviours might mirror cognitive biases observed in human\npsychology. In this work, we introduce a psychological taxonomy, categorizing\nVLMs' hallucination behaviours, including sycophancy, logical inconsistency,\nand a newly identified VLMs behaviour: authority bias. To systematically\nanalyze these behaviours, we design AIpsych, a scalable benchmark that reveals\npsychological tendencies in model response patterns. Leveraging this benchmark,\nwe investigate how variations in model architecture and parameter size\ninfluence model behaviour when responding to strategically manipulated\nquestions. Our experiments reveal that as model size increases, VLMs exhibit\nstronger sycophantic tendencies but reduced authority bias, suggesting\nincreasing competence but a potential erosion of response integrity. A human\nsubject study further validates our hypotheses and highlights key behavioural\ndifferences between VLMs and human respondents. This work suggests a new\nperspective for understanding hallucination in VLMs and highlights the\nimportance of integrating psychological principles into model evaluation.The\nbenchmark is available at https://github.com/lxrswdd/AIpsych."}

Our central thesis is\nthat for any universal approximator, the expressive power required for useful\ncomputation is inextricably linked to a dense set of instabilities that make\nperfect, reliable control a mathematical impossibility. We prove this through a\nthree-level argument that leaves no escape routes for any class of universal\napproximator architecture. i) Combinatorial Necessity: For the vast majority of\npractical universal approximators (e.g., those using ReLU activations), we\nprove that the density of catastrophic failure points is directly proportional\nto the network's expressive power. ii) Topological Necessity: For any\ntheoretical universal approximator, we use singularity theory to prove that the\nability to approximate generic functions requires the ability to implement the\ndense, catastrophic singularities that characterize them. iii) Empirical\nNecessity: We prove that the universal existence of adversarial examples is\nempirical evidence that real-world tasks are themselves catastrophic, forcing\nany successful model to learn and replicate these instabilities. These results,\ncombined with a quantitative \"Impossibility Sandwich\" showing that the minimum\ncomplexity for usefulness exceeds the maximum complexity for safety,\ndemonstrate that perfect alignment is not an engineering challenge but a\nmathematical impossibility.

First, in addition to applying CNN and ViT as local and global feature\nextractors, a statistical-based dynamic sample rectification (SDSR) module is\ndesigned to avoid the impact of poor regional consistency on spatial\ninformation learning process. Specifically, based on the fact that the PolSAR\ncovariance matrix conforms to the complex Wishart distribution, SDSR first\ndynamically evaluates the sample purity, and then performs pixel selection and\npixel generation to remove noisy pixels, thereby avoiding the feature\ninteraction between informative pixels and noisy pixels and improving the\nclassification feature extraction process.

Our findings reveal that LRM-1B not only adapts to different VRP\nchallenges but also showcases superior performance, outperforming existing\nmodels. Additionally, we explore the scaling behavior of neural routing models\nfrom 1M to 1B parameters. Our analysis confirms power-law between multiple\nmodel factors and performance, offering critical insights into the optimal\nconfigurations for foundation neural routing solvers."}

To mitigate interference among the dynamic, spatial and\nsemantic information during training, we adopt a block-wise structured\nattention mechanism that masks their mutual attention, preventing information\nleakage and keeping each representation clean and disentangled. Moreover, to\nmodel the conditional distribution over future actions, we employ a\ndiffusion-based transformer that disentangles action representations from\nshared latent features. Extensive experiments on both real-world and simulation\nenvironments demonstrate that DreamVLA achieves 76.7% success rate on real\nrobot tasks and 4.44 average length on the CALVIN ABC-D benchmarks."}

(b) The performance of zero-shot generic foundation models improves on\nover-segmented face images than tightly cropped faces thereby suggesting the\nimportance of contextual clues. For example, at a False Match Rate (FMR) of\n0.01%, the True Match Rate (TMR) of OpenCLIP improved from 64.97% to 81.73% on\nthe LFW dataset as the face crop increased from 112x112 to 250x250 while the\nTMR of domain-specific AdaFace dropped from 99.09% to 77.31%.

Contemporary data-driven methods using neural radiance\nfields have achieved photorealistic driving scene modeling, but they suffer\nfrom low rendering efficacy. Recently, some approaches have explored 3D\nGaussian splatting for modeling dynamic urban scenes, enabling high-fidelity\nreconstruction and real-time rendering.

As distance increases, intensified scattering leads to severe\nhaze and signal loss, making it impractical to recover distant details solely\nfrom visible images. Near-infrared, with superior fog penetration, offers\ncritical complementary cues through multimodal fusion. However, existing\nmethods focus on content integration while often neglecting haze embedded in\nvisible images, leading to results with residual haze. In this work, we argue\nthat the infrared and visible modalities not only provide complementary\nlow-level visual features, but also share high-level semantic consistency.\nMotivated by this, we propose a Hierarchical Semantic-Visual Fusion (HSVF)\nframework, comprising a semantic stream to reconstruct haze-free scenes and a\nvisual stream to incorporate structural details from the near-infrared\nmodality. The semantic stream first acquires haze-robust semantic prediction by\naligning modality-invariant intrinsic representations. Then the shared\nsemantics act as strong priors to restore clear and high-contrast distant\nscenes under severe haze degradation. In parallel, the visual stream focuses on\nrecovering lost structural details from near-infrared by fusing complementary\ncues from both visible and near-infrared images.

Moreover, the temporal drift of VI rigid transformation also degenerates\nthe scene flow estimation of static points. To address these challenges, we\npropose a drift-free rigid transformation estimator that fuses kinematic\nmodel-based ego-motions with neural network-learned results. It provides strong\nsupervision signals to radar-based rigid transformation and infers the scene\nflow of static points. Then, we develop an optical-mmWave supervision\nextraction module that extracts the supervision signals of radar rigid\ntransformation and scene flow. It strengthens the supervision by learning the\nscene flow of dynamic points with the joint constraints of optical and mmWave\nradar measurements. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, in smoke-filled\nenvironments, our method even outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches\nusing costly LiDARs."}

The quadratic\ncomputational complexity relative to window size restricts its ability to use a\nlarge window size for expanding the receptive field while maintaining low\ncomputational costs. To address this challenge, we propose PromptSR, a novel\nprompt-empowered lightweight image SR method. The core component is the\nproposed cascade prompting block (CPB), which enhances global information\naccess and local refinement via three cascaded prompting layers: a global\nanchor prompting layer (GAPL) and two local prompting layers (LPLs). The GAPL\nleverages downscaled features as anchors to construct low-dimensional anchor\nprompts (APs) through cross-scale attention, significantly reducing\ncomputational costs. These APs, with enhanced global perception, are then used\nto provide global prompts, efficiently facilitating long-range token\nconnections. The two LPLs subsequently combine category-based self-attention\nand window-based self-attention to refine the representation in a\ncoarse-to-fine manner. They leverage attention maps from the GAPL as additional\nglobal prompts, enabling them to perceive features globally at different\ngranularities for adaptive local refinement. In this way, the proposed CPB\neffectively combines global priors and local details, significantly enlarging\nthe receptive field while maintaining the low computational costs of our\nPromptSR. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method,\nwhich outperforms state-of-the-art lightweight SR methods in quantitative,\nqualitative, and complexity evaluations.

The first two chapters view inverse reinforcement learning\n(IRL) through the lens of revealed preferences from microeconomics while the\nthird chapter studies adaptive IRL via Langevin dynamics stochastic gradient\nalgorithms.\n  Chapter uses classical revealed preference theory (Afriat's theorem and\nextensions) to identify constrained utility maximizers based on observed agent\nactions. This allows for the reconstruction of set-valued estimates of an\nagent's utility. We illustrate this procedure by identifying the presence of a\ncognitive radar and reconstructing its utility function. The chapter also\naddresses the construction of a statistical detector for utility maximization\nbehavior when agent actions are corrupted by noise.\n  Chapter 2 studies Bayesian IRL. It investigates how an analyst can determine\nif an observed agent is a rationally inattentive Bayesian utility maximizer\n(i.e., simultaneously optimizing its utility and observation likelihood). The\nchapter discusses inverse stopping-time problems, focusing on reconstructing\nthe continuation and stopping costs of a Bayesian agent operating over a random\nhorizon. We then apply this IRL methodology to identify the presence of a\nBayes-optimal sequential detector. Additionally, Chapter 2 provides a concise\noverview of discrete choice models, inverse Bayesian filtering, and inverse\nstochastic gradient algorithms for adaptive IRL.\n  Finally, Chapter 3 introduces an adaptive IRL approach utilizing passive\nLangevin dynamics. This method aims to track time-varying utility functions\ngiven noisy and misspecified gradients. In essence, the adaptive IRL algorithms\npresented in Chapter 3 can be conceptualized as inverse stochastic gradient\nalgorithms, as they learn the utility function in real-time while a stochastic\ngradient algorithm is in operation."}

To improve its performance on real-world data,\ndepth regularizations have proven to be the most effective ones. However, depth\nestimation models not only require expensive 3D supervision in training, but\nalso suffer from generalization issues. As a result, the depth estimations can\nbe erroneous in practice, especially for outdoor unbounded scenes. In this\npaper, we propose to employ view-consistent distributions instead of fixed\ndepth value estimations to regularize NeRF training. Specifically, the\ndistribution is computed by utilizing both low-level color features and\nhigh-level distilled features from foundation models at the projected 2D\npixel-locations from per-ray sampled 3D points. By sampling from the\nview-consistency distributions, an implicit regularization is imposed on the\ntraining of NeRF.

Given pre-event\nimages and conditioned on multimodal spatial controls (e.g., text prompts,\ninstance layouts, and semantic maps), ChangeBridge can synthesize post-event\nimages. The core idea behind ChangeBridge is to modeling the noise-to-image\ndiffusion model, as a pre-to-post diffusion bridge. Conditioned on multimodal\ncontrols, ChangeBridge leverages a stochastic Brownian-bridge diffusion,\ndirectly modeling the spatiotemporal evolution between pre-event and post-event\nstates. To the best of our knowledge, ChangeBridge is the first spatiotemporal\ngenerative model with multimodal controls for remote sensing.

Through a thorough analysis of recently published methods and available\ndatasets, we identify a general lack of published resources dedicated to the\nproblem of describing videos in complex language, beyond the level of\ndescriptions in the form of enumerations of simple captions. Furthermore, while\nstate-of-the-art methods produce impressive results on the task of generating\nshorter captions from videos by direct end-to-end learning between the videos\nand text, the problem of explaining the relationship between vision and\nlanguage is still beyond our reach.

Building on the critiques, we propose a new architecture for a\ngeneral-purpose world model, based on hierarchical, multi-level, and mixed\ncontinuous/discrete representations, and a generative and self-supervision\nlearning framework, with an outlook of a Physical, Agentic, and Nested (PAN)\nAGI system enabled by such a model."}

However, collecting such embodied\ndata remains costly and inefficient. As a result, simulation environments have\nbecome a crucial surrogate for training robot policies. Yet, the significant\nReal2Sim2Real gap remains a critical bottleneck, particularly in terms of\nphysical dynamics and visual appearance. To address this challenge, we propose\nEmbodieDreamer, a novel framework that reduces the Real2Sim2Real gap from both\nthe physics and appearance perspectives. Specifically, we propose PhysAligner,\na differentiable physics module designed to reduce the Real2Sim physical gap.\nIt jointly optimizes robot-specific parameters such as control gains and\nfriction coefficients to better align simulated dynamics with real-world\nobservations. In addition, we introduce VisAligner, which incorporates a\nconditional video diffusion model to bridge the Sim2Real appearance gap by\ntranslating low-fidelity simulated renderings into photorealistic videos\nconditioned on simulation states, enabling high-fidelity visual transfer.\nExtensive experiments validate the effectiveness of EmbodieDreamer. The\nproposed PhysAligner reduces physical parameter estimation error by 3.74%\ncompared to simulated annealing methods while improving optimization speed by\n89.91\\%. Moreover, training robot policies in the generated photorealistic\nenvironment leads to a 29.17% improvement in the average task success rate\nacross real-world tasks after reinforcement learning. Code, model and data will\nbe publicly available."}

We address this critical gap between local sensor data and global\nnavigation information by proposing NavigScene, an auxiliary navigation-guided\nnatural language dataset that simulates a human-like driving environment within\nautonomous driving systems. Moreover, we develop three complementary paradigms\nto leverage NavigScene: (1) Navigation-guided Reasoning, which enhances\nvision-language models by incorporating navigation context into the prompting\napproach; (2) Navigation-guided Preference Optimization, a reinforcement\nlearning method that extends Direct Preference Optimization to improve\nvision-language model responses by establishing preferences for\nnavigation-relevant summarized information; and (3) Navigation-guided\nVision-Language-Action model, which integrates navigation guidance and\nvision-language models with conventional driving models through feature fusion.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that our approaches significantly improve\nperformance across perception, prediction, planning, and question-answering\ntasks by enabling reasoning capabilities beyond visual range and improving\ngeneralization to diverse driving scenarios. This work represents a significant\nstep toward more comprehensive autonomous driving systems capable of navigating\ncomplex, unfamiliar environments with greater reliability and safety."}

While Video-based Large Language Models\n(Video-LLMs) have driven recent progress, current VLN methods based on\nVideo-LLM often face trade-offs among fine-grained visual understanding,\nlong-term context modeling and computational efficiency. We introduce\nStreamVLN, a streaming VLN framework that employs a hybrid slow-fast context\nmodeling strategy to support multi-modal reasoning over interleaved vision,\nlanguage and action inputs. The fast-streaming dialogue context facilitates\nresponsive action generation through a sliding-window of active dialogues,\nwhile the slow-updating memory context compresses historical visual states\nusing a 3D-aware token pruning strategy. With this slow-fast design, StreamVLN\nachieves coherent multi-turn dialogue through efficient KV cache reuse,\nsupporting long video streams with bounded context size and inference cost.\nExperiments on VLN-CE benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance with\nstable low latency, ensuring robustness and efficiency in real-world\ndeployment.
