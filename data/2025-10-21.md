### [1] [ESCA: Contextualizing Embodied Agents via Scene-Graph Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15963)
*Jiani Huang,Amish Sethi,Matthew Kuo,Mayank Keoliya,Neelay Velingker,JungHo Jung,Ser-Nam Lim,Ziyang Li,Mayur Naik*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了ESCA框架和SGClip模型，通过结构化时空理解来增强多模态大语言模型的具身智能体能力，无需人工标注的场景图数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型主要依赖高层视觉-声音-文本配对，缺乏像素级视觉内容与文本语义的细粒度结构化对齐。

Method: 开发了SGClip模型，基于CLIP架构，通过神经符号学习管道在8.7万+开放域视频上训练，利用模型驱动的自监督和结构化推理生成场景图。

Result: SGClip在场景图生成和动作定位基准测试中表现优异，ESCA框架显著提升了开源和商业MLLM的性能，在两个具身环境中达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: ESCA框架通过结构化空间-时间理解有效减少了智能体感知错误，使开源模型能够超越专有基线模型。

Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) are making rapid progress toward
general-purpose embodied agents. However, current training pipelines primarily
rely on high-level vision-sound-text pairs and lack fine-grained, structured
alignment between pixel-level visual content and textual semantics. To overcome
this challenge, we propose ESCA, a new framework for contextualizing embodied
agents through structured spatial-temporal understanding. At its core is
SGClip, a novel CLIP-based, open-domain, and promptable model for generating
scene graphs. SGClip is trained on 87K+ open-domain videos via a neurosymbolic
learning pipeline, which harnesses model-driven self-supervision from
video-caption pairs and structured reasoning, thereby eliminating the need for
human-labeled scene graph annotations. We demonstrate that SGClip supports both
prompt-based inference and task-specific fine-tuning, excelling in scene graph
generation and action localization benchmarks. ESCA with SGClip consistently
improves both open-source and commercial MLLMs, achieving state-of-the-art
performance across two embodied environments. Notably, it significantly reduces
agent perception errors and enables open-source models to surpass proprietary
baselines.

### [2] [CrossRay3D: Geometry and Distribution Guidance for Efficient Multimodal 3D Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15991)
*Huiming Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出CrossRay3D稀疏多模态检测器，通过射线感知监督和类别平衡监督提升token表示质量，在nuScenes基准上达到SOTA性能，且对传感器缺失具有强鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有稀疏检测器忽视token表示质量，导致前景质量欠佳和性能受限。本文发现几何结构保持和类别分布是提升稀疏检测器性能的关键。

Method: 提出Sparse Selector(SS)，包含射线感知监督(RAS)保持几何信息，类别平衡监督自适应重加权类别语义显著性，以及射线位置编码(Ray PE)解决LiDAR与图像模态分布差异。

Result: 在nuScenes基准上达到72.4 mAP和74.7 NDS的SOTA性能，运行速度比其他领先方法快1.84倍，且在LiDAR或相机数据部分或完全缺失时仍保持强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: CrossRay3D通过改进token表示质量，在保持稀疏检测器优势的同时显著提升了性能，证明了几何结构保持和类别平衡的重要性。

Abstract: The sparse cross-modality detector offers more advantages than its
counterpart, the Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) detector, particularly in terms of
adaptability for downstream tasks and computational cost savings. However,
existing sparse detectors overlook the quality of token representation, leaving
it with a sub-optimal foreground quality and limited performance. In this
paper, we identify that the geometric structure preserved and the class
distribution are the key to improving the performance of the sparse detector,
and propose a Sparse Selector (SS). The core module of SS is Ray-Aware
Supervision (RAS), which preserves rich geometric information during the
training stage, and Class-Balanced Supervision, which adaptively reweights the
salience of class semantics, ensuring that tokens associated with small objects
are retained during token sampling. Thereby, outperforming other sparse
multi-modal detectors in the representation of tokens. Additionally, we design
Ray Positional Encoding (Ray PE) to address the distribution differences
between the LiDAR modality and the image. Finally, we integrate the
aforementioned module into an end-to-end sparse multi-modality detector, dubbed
CrossRay3D. Experiments show that, on the challenging nuScenes benchmark,
CrossRay3D achieves state-of-the-art performance with 72.4 mAP and 74.7 NDS,
while running 1.84 faster than other leading methods. Moreover, CrossRay3D
demonstrates strong robustness even in scenarios where LiDAR or camera data are
partially or entirely missing.

### [3] [InfraGPT Smart Infrastructure: An End-to-End VLM-Based Framework for Detecting and Managing Urban Defects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16017)
*Ibrahim Sheikh Mohamed,Abdullah Yahya Abdullah Omaisan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一个基于CCTV监控的智能城市基础设施缺陷检测系统，使用YOLO进行多缺陷检测和分割，并通过视觉语言模型生成结构化的维修行动计划。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能城市基础设施监控需求增长，手动检查成本高且危险，现有自动系统通常只处理单一缺陷类型或输出非结构化结果，无法直接指导维修工作。

Method: 利用街道CCTV流，使用YOLO系列目标检测器进行多缺陷检测和分割，然后将检测结果传递给视觉语言模型进行场景感知总结，生成包含事件描述、推荐工具、尺寸、维修计划和紧急警报的JSON格式结构化行动计划。

Result: 在公共数据集和捕获的CCTV片段上的实验评估表明，系统能准确识别多种缺陷并生成连贯的总结。

Conclusion: 讨论了将系统扩展到城市范围部署的挑战和方向。

Abstract: Infrastructure in smart cities is increasingly monitored by networks of
closed circuit television (CCTV) cameras. Roads, bridges and tunnels develop
cracks, potholes, and fluid leaks that threaten public safety and require
timely repair. Manual inspection is costly and hazardous, and existing
automatic systems typically address individual defect types or provide
unstructured outputs that cannot directly guide maintenance crews. This paper
proposes a comprehensive pipeline that leverages street CCTV streams for multi
defect detection and segmentation using the YOLO family of object detectors and
passes the detections to a vision language model (VLM) for scene aware
summarization. The VLM generates a structured action plan in JSON format that
includes incident descriptions, recommended tools, dimensions, repair plans,
and urgent alerts. We review literature on pothole, crack and leak detection,
highlight recent advances in large vision language models such as QwenVL and
LLaVA, and describe the design of our early prototype. Experimental evaluation
on public datasets and captured CCTV clips demonstrates that the system
accurately identifies diverse defects and produces coherent summaries. We
conclude by discussing challenges and directions for scaling the system to city
wide deployments.

### [4] [IAD-GPT: Advancing Visual Knowledge in Multimodal Large Language Model for Industrial Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16036)
*Zewen Li,Zitong Yu,Qilang Ye,Weicheng Xie,Wei Zhuo,Linlin Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出IAD-GPT，一种基于多模态大语言模型的工业异常检测新范式，通过异常提示生成器、文本引导增强器和多掩码融合模块，结合文本语义与图像信息实现先进的异常检测和分割。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统工业异常检测方法缺乏多轮人机对话和详细描述能力，而基于大预训练模型的方法尚未充分激发大模型在异常检测任务中的潜力。

Method: 使用异常提示生成器生成详细异常提示，通过文本引导增强器增强视觉定位能力，设计多掩码融合模块将掩码作为专家知识融入模型。

Result: 在MVTec-AD和VisA数据集上的实验表明，该方法在自监督和少样本异常检测与分割任务中达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: IAD-GPT成功结合了多模态大语言模型的因果推理能力与工业异常检测需求，为智能工业检测提供了新思路。

Abstract: The robust causal capability of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) hold
the potential of detecting defective objects in Industrial Anomaly Detection
(IAD). However, most traditional IAD methods lack the ability to provide
multi-turn human-machine dialogues and detailed descriptions, such as the color
of objects, the shape of an anomaly, or specific types of anomalies. At the
same time, methods based on large pre-trained models have not fully stimulated
the ability of large models in anomaly detection tasks. In this paper, we
explore the combination of rich text semantics with both image-level and
pixel-level information from images and propose IAD-GPT, a novel paradigm based
on MLLMs for IAD. We employ Abnormal Prompt Generator (APG) to generate
detailed anomaly prompts for specific objects. These specific prompts from the
large language model (LLM) are used to activate the detection and segmentation
functions of the pre-trained visual-language model (i.e., CLIP). To enhance the
visual grounding ability of MLLMs, we propose Text-Guided Enhancer, wherein
image features interact with normal and abnormal text prompts to dynamically
select enhancement pathways, which enables language models to focus on specific
aspects of visual data, enhancing their ability to accurately interpret and
respond to anomalies within images. Moreover, we design a Multi-Mask Fusion
module to incorporate mask as expert knowledge, which enhances the LLM's
perception of pixel-level anomalies. Extensive experiments on MVTec-AD and VisA
datasets demonstrate our state-of-the-art performance on self-supervised and
few-shot anomaly detection and segmentation tasks, such as MVTec-AD and VisA
datasets. The codes are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究评估了三种放射学报告模式（自由文本、结构化报告、AI辅助结构化报告）对图像分析行为、诊断准确性、效率和用户体验的影响，发现AI辅助结构化报告在诊断准确性和效率方面表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索结构化报告和人工智能如何改变放射科医生与影像研究的交互方式，评估不同报告模式对放射学工作流程的影响。

Method: 前瞻性研究，8名读者（4名新手和4名非新手）使用定制化查看器和眼动追踪系统分析35张床旁胸片，比较三种报告模式的诊断准确性、报告时间、眼动指标和用户体验。

Result: AI辅助结构化报告的诊断准确性最高（κ=0.71），报告时间最短（25±9秒），眼动指标显示视觉注意力更集中于图像区域，且成为最受偏好的报告模式。

Conclusion: 结构化报告通过引导视觉注意力向图像来提高效率，而AI预填充的结构化报告进一步提升了诊断准确性和用户满意度。

Abstract: Structured reporting (SR) and artificial intelligence (AI) may transform how
radiologists interact with imaging studies. This prospective study (July to
December 2024) evaluated the impact of three reporting modes: free-text (FT),
structured reporting (SR), and AI-assisted structured reporting (AI-SR), on
image analysis behavior, diagnostic accuracy, efficiency, and user experience.
Four novice and four non-novice readers (radiologists and medical students)
each analyzed 35 bedside chest radiographs per session using a customized
viewer and an eye-tracking system. Outcomes included diagnostic accuracy
(compared with expert consensus using Cohen's $\kappa$), reporting time per
radiograph, eye-tracking metrics, and questionnaire-based user experience.
Statistical analysis used generalized linear mixed models with Bonferroni
post-hoc tests with a significance level of ($P \le .01$). Diagnostic accuracy
was similar in FT ($\kappa = 0.58$) and SR ($\kappa = 0.60$) but higher in
AI-SR ($\kappa = 0.71$, $P < .001$). Reporting times decreased from $88 \pm 38$
s (FT) to $37 \pm 18$ s (SR) and $25 \pm 9$ s (AI-SR) ($P < .001$). Saccade
counts for the radiograph field ($205 \pm 135$ (FT), $123 \pm 88$ (SR), $97 \pm
58$ (AI-SR)) and total fixation duration for the report field ($11 \pm 5$ s
(FT), $5 \pm 3$ s (SR), $4 \pm 1$ s (AI-SR)) were lower with SR and AI-SR ($P <
.001$ each). Novice readers shifted gaze towards the radiograph in SR, while
non-novice readers maintained their focus on the radiograph. AI-SR was the
preferred mode. In conclusion, SR improves efficiency by guiding visual
attention toward the image, and AI-prefilled SR further enhances diagnostic
accuracy and user satisfaction.

### [6] [Data-Driven Analysis of Intersectional Bias in Image Classification: A Framework with Bias-Weighted Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16072)
*Farjana Yesmin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个数据驱动的框架IFEF来分析图像分类中的交叉偏见，并开发了Bias-Weighted Augmentation方法，通过在Open Images V7数据集上的实验证明能显著改善代表性不足类别的准确性和公平性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习模型在非平衡数据集上训练时经常表现出交叉偏见——由对象类别和环境条件等多属性交互产生的系统性错误，需要系统性地分析和缓解这类偏见。

Method: 提出了交叉公平性评估框架(IFEF)结合定量公平性指标和可解释性工具来识别偏见模式，并开发了基于子群分布统计的自适应变换强度的Bias-Weighted Augmentation数据增强策略。

Result: 在Open Images V7数据集上，BWA方法将代表性不足类别-环境交叉的准确性提高了24个百分点，同时将公平性指标差异减少了35%，统计显著性分析确认了改进的有效性(p < 0.05)。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一个可复现的方法来分析和解快图像分类系统中的交叉偏见问题。

Abstract: Machine learning models trained on imbalanced datasets often exhibit
intersectional biases-systematic errors arising from the interaction of
multiple attributes such as object class and environmental conditions. This
paper presents a data-driven framework for analyzing and mitigating such biases
in image classification. We introduce the Intersectional Fairness Evaluation
Framework (IFEF), which combines quantitative fairness metrics with
interpretability tools to systematically identify bias patterns in model
predictions. Building on this analysis, we propose Bias-Weighted Augmentation
(BWA), a novel data augmentation strategy that adapts transformation
intensities based on subgroup distribution statistics. Experiments on the Open
Images V7 dataset with five object classes demonstrate that BWA improves
accuracy for underrepresented class-environment intersections by up to 24
percentage points while reducing fairness metric disparities by 35%.
Statistical analysis across multiple independent runs confirms the significance
of improvements (p < 0.05). Our methodology provides a replicable approach for
analyzing and addressing intersectional biases in image classification systems.

### [7] [Differentiable, Bit-shifting, and Scalable Quantization without training neural network from scratch](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16088)
*Zia Badar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种可微分的神经网络量化方法，支持多比特量化，在ImageNet数据集上使用ResNet18进行权重量化时，仅用15个训练周期就达到了与全精度模型相差不到1%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有量化方法存在两个主要问题：一是大多使用不可微分方法，在反向传播中手动设置导数，影响学习能力；二是移位/对数量化方法要么避免激活量化，要么准确率较低。本文旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 提出可微分的量化方法，支持n比特量化，特别是移位比特量化。该方法能够学习形式为2^n的对数量化值，并提供收敛到最优神经网络的证明。

Result: 在ImageNet图像分类任务中，仅权重量化时准确率与全精度模型相差不到1%；权重和激活量化时达到与SOTA方法相当的准确率，仅需15个训练周期。推理成本略高于1比特量化，但不需要高精度乘法。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种高效的可微分量化方案，在保持高准确率的同时显著减少了计算和内存需求，特别适合资源受限环境。

Abstract: Quantization of neural networks provides benefits of inference in less
compute and memory requirements. Previous work in quantization lack two
important aspects which this work provides. First almost all previous work in
quantization used a non-differentiable approach and for learning; the
derivative is usually set manually in backpropogation which make the learning
ability of algorithm questionable, our approach is not just differentiable, we
also provide proof of convergence of our approach to the optimal neural
network. Second previous work in shift/logrithmic quantization either have
avoided activation quantization along with weight quantization or achieved less
accuracy. Learning logrithmic quantize values of form $2^n$ requires the
quantization function can scale to more than 1 bit quantization which is
another benifit of our quantization that it provides $n$ bits quantization as
well. Our approach when tested with image classification task using imagenet
dataset, resnet18 and weight quantization only achieves less than 1 percent
accuracy compared to full precision accuracy while taking only 15 epochs to
train using shift bit quantization and achieves comparable to SOTA approaches
accuracy in both weight and activation quantization using shift bit
quantization in 15 training epochs with slightly higher(only higher cpu
instructions) inference cost compared to 1 bit quantization(without logrithmic
quantization) and not requiring any higher precision multiplication.

*Jianhan Lin,Yuchu Qin,Shuai Gao,Yikang Rui,Jie Liu,Yanjie Lv*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出StripRFNet网络用于道路表面损伤检测，通过形状感知、条状感受野和小尺度增强三个模块，在RDD2022基准测试中达到最先进精度和实时效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 道路表面损伤威胁交通安全并阻碍可持续城市发展，但现有方法在检测多样形状损伤、细长裂缝和小尺度损伤方面存在挑战。

Method: StripRFNet包含三个模块：形状感知模块（SPM）通过大分离核注意力增强形状判别；条状感受野模块（SRFM）使用大条状卷积和池化捕获细长裂缝特征；小尺度增强模块（SSEM）利用高分辨率P2特征图、专用检测头和动态上采样改进小目标检测。

Result: 在RDD2022基准测试中，中国子集的F1分数、mAP50和mAP50:95分别比基线提高4.4、2.9和3.4个百分点；完整数据集上达到80.33%的最高F1分数，同时保持有竞争力的推理速度。

Conclusion: StripRFNet实现了最先进的准确性和实时效率，为智能道路维护和可持续基础设施管理提供了有前景的工具。

Abstract: Well-maintained road networks are crucial for achieving Sustainable
Development Goal (SDG) 11. Road surface damage not only threatens traffic
safety but also hinders sustainable urban development. Accurate detection,
however, remains challenging due to the diverse shapes of damages, the
difficulty of capturing slender cracks with high aspect ratios, and the high
error rates in small-scale damage recognition. To address these issues, we
propose StripRFNet, a novel deep neural network comprising three modules: (1) a
Shape Perception Module (SPM) that enhances shape discrimination via large
separable kernel attention (LSKA) in multi-scale feature aggregation; (2) a
Strip Receptive Field Module (SRFM) that employs large strip convolutions and
pooling to capture features of slender cracks; and (3) a Small-Scale
Enhancement Module (SSEM) that leverages a high-resolution P2 feature map, a
dedicated detection head, and dynamic upsampling to improve small-object
detection. Experiments on the RDD2022 benchmark show that StripRFNet surpasses
existing methods. On the Chinese subset, it improves F1-score, mAP50, and
mAP50:95 by 4.4, 2.9, and 3.4 percentage points over the baseline,
respectively. On the full dataset, it achieves the highest F1-score of 80.33%
compared with CRDDC'2022 participants and ORDDC'2024 Phase 2 results, while
maintaining competitive inference speed. These results demonstrate that
StripRFNet achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and real-time efficiency,
offering a promising tool for intelligent road maintenance and sustainable
infrastructure management.

### [9] [ObjectTransforms for Uncertainty Quantification and Reduction in Vision-Based Perception for Autonomous Vehicles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16118)
*Nishad Sahu,Shounak Sural,Aditya Satish Patil,Ragunathan,Rajkumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ObjectTransforms是一种通过对象特定变换来量化和减少视觉目标检测中不确定性的技术，在训练和推理时分别提高鲁棒性和量化预测不确定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶中可靠的感知至关重要，但基于视觉的目标检测神经网络容易受到数据偏差和分布偏移等不确定性因素的影响。

Method: 在训练时对单个对象进行颜色空间扰动，并使用扩散模型生成多样化的行人实例；在推理时对检测到的对象应用扰动，利用检测分数的方差实时量化预测不确定性。

Result: 在NuImages 10K数据集上的实验表明，该方法在所有对象类别上都带来了显著的准确性提升和不确定性减少，在推理时对假阳性预测了比真阳性更高的不确定性值。

Conclusion: ObjectTransforms作为一种轻量级但有效的机制，在训练和推理时分别具有减少和量化视觉感知不确定性的潜力。

Abstract: Reliable perception is fundamental for safety critical decision making in
autonomous driving. Yet, vision based object detector neural networks remain
vulnerable to uncertainty arising from issues such as data bias and
distributional shifts. In this paper, we introduce ObjectTransforms, a
technique for quantifying and reducing uncertainty in vision based object
detection through object specific transformations at both training and
inference times. At training time, ObjectTransforms perform color space
perturbations on individual objects, improving robustness to lighting and color
variations. ObjectTransforms also uses diffusion models to generate realistic,
diverse pedestrian instances. At inference time, object perturbations are
applied to detected objects and the variance of detection scores are used to
quantify predictive uncertainty in real time. This uncertainty signal is then
used to filter out false positives and also recover false negatives, improving
the overall precision recall curve. Experiments with YOLOv8 on the NuImages 10K
dataset demonstrate that our method yields notable accuracy improvements and
uncertainty reduction across all object classes during training, while
predicting desirably higher uncertainty values for false positives as compared
to true positives during inference. Our results highlight the potential of
ObjectTransforms as a lightweight yet effective mechanism for reducing and
quantifying uncertainty in vision-based perception during training and
inference respectively.

*Sayan Deb Sarkar,Sinisa Stekovic,Vincent Lepetit,Iro Armeni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练的方法，通过引导采样过程将外观（图像或文本）转移到3D资产上，解决了现有方法在几何差异较大时失败的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在游戏、增强现实和数字内容创作等行业中，将外观转移到3D资产具有广泛应用，但现有方法在输入和外观对象的几何形状显著不同时会失败。

Method: 基于预训练的整流流模型，在采样过程中定期添加引导，该引导可建模为可微损失函数，包括外观感知损失和自相似性损失。

Conclusion: 该方法具有通用性，可扩展到不同类型的扩散模型和引导函数，并通过GPT评估系统解决了传统指标不适用的问题。

Abstract: Transferring appearance to 3D assets using different representations of the
appearance object - such as images or text - has garnered interest due to its
wide range of applications in industries like gaming, augmented reality, and
digital content creation. However, state-of-the-art methods still fail when the
geometry between the input and appearance objects is significantly different. A
straightforward approach is to directly apply a 3D generative model, but we
show that this ultimately fails to produce appealing results. Instead, we
propose a principled approach inspired by universal guidance. Given a
pretrained rectified flow model conditioned on image or text, our training-free
method interacts with the sampling process by periodically adding guidance.
This guidance can be modeled as a differentiable loss function, and we
experiment with two different types of guidance including part-aware losses for
appearance and self-similarity. Our experiments show that our approach
successfully transfers texture and geometric details to the input 3D asset,
outperforming baselines both qualitatively and quantitatively. We also show
that traditional metrics are not suitable for evaluating the task due to their
inability of focusing on local details and comparing dissimilar inputs, in
absence of ground truth data. We thus evaluate appearance transfer quality with
a GPT-based system objectively ranking outputs, ensuring robust and human-like
assessment, as further confirmed by our user study. Beyond showcased scenarios,
our method is general and could be extended to different types of diffusion
models and guidance functions.

Abstract: Thrombectomy is one of the most effective treatments for ischemic stroke, but
it is resource and personnel-intensive. We propose employing deep learning to
automate critical aspects of thrombectomy, thereby enhancing efficiency and
safety. In this work, we introduce a self-supervised framework that classifies
various skeletal landmarks using a regression-based pretext task. Our
experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms existing methods in both
regression and classification tasks. Notably, our results indicate that the
positional pretext task significantly enhances downstream classification
performance. Future work will focus on extending this framework toward fully
autonomous C-arm control, aiming to optimize trajectories from the pelvis to
the head during stroke thrombectomy procedures. All code used is available at

semi-supervised learning increasingly appealing for its ability to learn from
imperfect supervision. Recently, teacher-student frameworks have gained
popularity for their training benefits and robust performance. However, jointly
optimizing the entire network can hinder convergence and stability, especially
in challenging scenarios. To address this for medical image segmentation, we
propose DuetMatch, a novel dual-branch semi-supervised framework with
asynchronous optimization, where each branch optimizes either the encoder or
decoder while keeping the other frozen. To improve consistency under noisy
conditions, we introduce Decoupled Dropout Perturbation, enforcing
regularization across branches. We also design Pair-wise CutMix Cross-Guidance
to enhance model diversity by exchanging pseudo-labels through augmented input
pairs. To mitigate confirmation bias from noisy pseudo-labels, we propose
Consistency Matching, refining labels using stable predictions from frozen
teacher models. Extensive experiments on benchmark brain MRI segmentation
datasets, including ISLES2022 and BraTS, show that DuetMatch consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating its effectiveness and
robustness across diverse semi-supervised segmentation scenarios.

TL;DR: 提出了一种自主导航C型臂到预定义解剖标志的管道，利用X射线图像预测3D位移向量，结合不确定度估计和保形预测确保可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床工作流程依赖手动对齐C型臂，这会增加辐射暴露和手术延迟，需要自动化解决方案来提高效率和安全性。

Method: 使用X射线图像预测3D位移向量，结合概率损失和骨骼姿态正则化，采用保形预测校准不确定度，在DeepDRR生成的合成X射线数据集上训练。

Result: 在多个架构上显示出强大的定位精度和良好校准的预测边界，验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该管道有潜力成为安全可靠自主C型臂系统的组成部分，代码已开源。

Abstract: Accurate and reliable C-arm positioning is essential for fluoroscopy-guided
interventions. However, clinical workflows rely on manual alignment that
increases radiation exposure and procedural delays. In this work, we present a
pipeline that autonomously navigates the C-arm to predefined anatomical
landmarks utilizing X-ray images. Given an input X-ray image from an arbitrary
starting location on the operating table, the model predicts a 3D displacement
vector toward each target landmark along the body. To ensure reliable
deployment, we capture both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties in the
model's predictions and further calibrate them using conformal prediction. The
derived prediction regions are interpreted as 3D confidence regions around the
predicted landmark locations. The training framework combines a probabilistic
loss with skeletal pose regularization to encourage anatomically plausible
outputs. We validate our approach on a synthetic X-ray dataset generated from
DeepDRR. Results show not only strong localization accuracy across multiple
architectures but also well-calibrated prediction bounds. These findings
highlight the pipeline's potential as a component in safe and reliable
autonomous C-arm systems. Code is available at

TL;DR: 提出一个公式来估计基于精度和通过率的通用图像质量评估引擎的成本节约，并在背景修复用例中展示通过简单AutoML解决方案实现51.61%的成本节约。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度生成模型生成的图像质量尚未达到传统摄影方法的标准，生产流程中需要手动图像质量评估，这个过程耗时且昂贵，特别是因为自动生成图像通过质量标准的比例较低。

Method: 引入自动预过滤阶段，通过通用图像质量评估引擎提高发送审核图像的整体质量，从而降低获得高质量图像的平均成本。

Result: 在背景修复用例中，使用简单的AutoML解决方案实现了51.61%的成本节约。

Conclusion: 自动预过滤阶段可以显著降低图像质量评估的工作量，通过提高通过审核的图像质量来减少获得高质量图像的成本。

Abstract: Deep generative models have shown impressive progress in recent years, making
it possible to produce high quality images with a simple text prompt or a
reference image. However, state of the art technology does not yet meet the
quality standards offered by traditional photographic methods. For this reason,
production pipelines that use generated images often include a manual stage of
image quality assessment (IQA). This process is slow and expensive, especially
because of the low yield of automatically generated images that pass the
quality bar. The IQA workload can be reduced by introducing an automatic
pre-filtering stage, that will increase the overall quality of the images sent
to review and, therefore, reduce the average cost required to obtain a high
quality image. We present a formula that estimates the cost savings depending
on the precision and pass yield of a generic IQA engine. This formula is
applied in a use case of background inpainting, showcasing a significant cost
saving of 51.61% obtained with a simple AutoML solution.

TL;DR: 该论文提出PRISM模型，将fMRI信号投射到结构化文本空间作为中间表示，用于视觉刺激重建。研究发现fMRI信号更接近语言模型的文本空间而非视觉空间，并提出通过对象中心扩散和属性关系搜索来提升重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解大脑如何编码视觉信息是神经科学和机器学习的重要挑战。目前从fMRI信号重建视觉刺激的方法依赖于将信号转换为潜在空间，但哪种潜在空间最适合以及如何组织该空间来有效表示视觉刺激仍不清楚。

Conclusion: 使用结构化文本作为中间空间来桥接fMRI信号和图像重建具有重要意义，fMRI信号与语言模型的文本空间相似度高于视觉空间或联合文本图像空间。

Abstract: Understanding how the brain encodes visual information is a central challenge
in neuroscience and machine learning. A promising approach is to reconstruct
visual stimuli, essentially images, from functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging
(fMRI) signals. This involves two stages: transforming fMRI signals into a
latent space and then using a pretrained generative model to reconstruct
images. The reconstruction quality depends on how similar the latent space is
to the structure of neural activity and how well the generative model produces
images from that space. Yet, it remains unclear which type of latent space best
supports this transformation and how it should be organized to represent visual
stimuli effectively. We present two key findings. First, fMRI signals are more
similar to the text space of a language model than to either a vision based
space or a joint text image space. Second, text representations and the
generative model should be adapted to capture the compositional nature of
visual stimuli, including objects, their detailed attributes, and
relationships. Building on these insights, we propose PRISM, a model that
Projects fMRI sIgnals into a Structured text space as an interMediate
representation for visual stimuli reconstruction. It includes an object centric
diffusion module that generates images by composing individual objects to
reduce object detection errors, and an attribute relationship search module
that automatically identifies key attributes and relationships that best align
with the neural activity. Extensive experiments on real world datasets
demonstrate that our framework outperforms existing methods, achieving up to an
8% reduction in perceptual loss. These results highlight the importance of
using structured text as the intermediate space to bridge fMRI signals and
image reconstruction.

Abstract: Mapping agriculture in tropical areas through remote sensing presents unique
challenges, including the lack of high-quality annotated data, the elevated
costs of labeling, data variability, and regional generalisation. This paper
advocates a Data-Centric Artificial Intelligence (DCAI) perspective and

### [18] [StretchySnake: Flexible SSM Training Unlocks Action Recognition Across Spatio-Temporal Scales](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16209)
*Nyle Siddiqui,Rohit Gupta,Sirnam Swetha,Mubarak Shah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对视频状态空间模型（SSM）的灵活训练方法StretchySnake，通过在训练中采样不同时空分辨率的视频并动态插值模型权重，使模型能够无缝处理从短片段到长活动的各种视频，在多个基准测试中优于transformer和SSM基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频理解训练方法主要针对transformer设计，未能充分利用SSM的独特属性。由于注意力机制的二次复杂度，视频模型通常在固定分辨率和长度下训练，导致在未见时空分辨率上性能下降，限制了模型在长短视频上的性能保持能力。

Method: 提出灵活训练方法，在训练过程中采样不同时空分辨率的视频，并动态插值模型权重以适应任意时空尺度。比较了五种不同的灵活训练变体，确定了视频SSM的最有效策略。

Result: 在短动作（UCF-101、HMDB-51）和长动作（COIN、Breakfast）基准测试中，StretchySnake比transformer和SSM基线性能提升高达28%，在细粒度动作（SSV2、Diving-48）上表现出强大的适应性。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一个简单的即插即用训练方案，使视频SSM在各种动作识别场景中更加鲁棒、分辨率无关且高效。

Abstract: State space models (SSMs) have emerged as a competitive alternative to
transformers in various tasks. Their linear complexity and hidden-state
recurrence make them particularly attractive for modeling long sequences,
whereas attention becomes quadratically expensive. However, current training
methods for video understanding are tailored towards transformers and fail to
fully leverage the unique attributes of SSMs. For example, video models are
often trained at a fixed resolution and video length to balance the quadratic
scaling of attention cost against performance. Consequently, these models
suffer from degraded performance when evaluated on videos with spatial and
temporal resolutions unseen during training; a property we call spatio-temporal
inflexibility. In the context of action recognition, this severely limits a
model's ability to retain performance across both short- and long-form videos.
Therefore, we propose a flexible training method that leverages and improves
the inherent adaptability of SSMs. Our method samples videos at varying
temporal and spatial resolutions during training and dynamically interpolates
model weights to accommodate any spatio-temporal scale. This instills our SSM,
which we call StretchySnake, with spatio-temporal flexibility and enables it to
seamlessly handle videos ranging from short, fine-grained clips to long,
complex activities. We introduce and compare five different variants of
flexible training, and identify the most effective strategy for video SSMs. On
short-action (UCF-101, HMDB-51) and long-action (COIN, Breakfast) benchmarks,
StretchySnake outperforms transformer and SSM baselines alike by up to 28%,
with strong adaptability to fine-grained actions (SSV2, Diving-48). Therefore,
our method provides a simple drop-in training recipe that makes video SSMs more
robust, resolution-agnostic, and efficient across diverse action recognition
scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CNN难以捕捉全局面部特征，Vision Transformer能建模长距离空间关系但计算复杂度高，需要结合两者的优势来解决面部美预测的挑战。

Method: 使用异构集成架构，融合Vision Transformer（擅长捕捉全局面部结构和对称性）和Mamba视觉模型（以线性复杂度高效建模长距离依赖关系，关注序列特征和纹理）。

Result: 在SCUT-FBP5500数据集上取得PC=0.9212、MAE=0.2085、RMSE=0.2698的最先进性能，并通过Grad-CAM可视化验证了两个骨干网络的互补特征提取能力。

Conclusion: VM-BeautyNet为计算美学提供了强大的新架构范式，通过结合ViT和Mamba模型的互补优势，显著提升了面部美预测的性能和可解释性。

Abstract: Facial Beauty Prediction (FBP) is a complex and challenging computer vision
task, aiming to model the subjective and intricate nature of human aesthetic
perception. While deep learning models, particularly Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs), have made significant strides, they often struggle to capture
the global, holistic facial features that are critical to human judgment.
Vision Transformers (ViT) address this by effectively modeling long-range
spatial relationships, but their quadratic complexity can be a bottleneck. This
paper introduces a novel, heterogeneous ensemble architecture,
\textbf{VM-BeautyNet}, that synergistically fuses the complementary strengths
of a Vision Transformer and a Mamba-based Vision model, a recent advancement in
State-Space Models (SSMs). The ViT backbone excels at capturing global facial
structure and symmetry, while the Mamba backbone efficiently models long-range
dependencies with linear complexity, focusing on sequential features and
textures. We evaluate our approach on the benchmark SCUT-FBP5500 dataset. Our
proposed VM-BeautyNet achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a
\textbf{Pearson Correlation (PC) of 0.9212}, a \textbf{Mean Absolute Error
(MAE) of 0.2085}, and a \textbf{Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.2698}.
Furthermore, through Grad-CAM visualizations, we provide interpretability
analysis that confirms the complementary feature extraction of the two
backbones, offering new insights into the model's decision-making process and
presenting a powerful new architectural paradigm for computational aesthetics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: OCSCC是头颈部最常见的癌症，早期症状不明显且生长缓慢，常被漏诊导致可预防的死亡。利用CNN的精确图像分割和模式识别能力可实现早期检测。

Method: 训练CNN模型使用4293张训练图像（良性/恶性肿瘤及阴性样本），测试不同分辨率图像对预测准确性的影响，并开发图像采集硬件和应用程序。

Result: 图像分辨率增加时预测准确性呈对数增长，显示更高像素数带来的收益递减。设计的增强硬件能捕获详细图像并提高检测效果。

Conclusion: CNN结合硬件系统可有效检测OCSCC，图像分辨率对准确性有重要影响但存在收益递减现象，开发的应用程序使CNN更易访问。

Abstract: Oral Cavity Squamous Cell Carcinoma (OCSCC) is the most common type of head
and neck cancer. Due to the subtle nature of its early stages, deep and hidden
areas of development, and slow growth, OCSCC often goes undetected, leading to
preventable deaths. However, properly trained Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs), with their precise image segmentation techniques and ability to apply
kernel matrices to modify the RGB values of images for accurate image pattern
recognition, would be an effective means for early detection of OCSCC. Pairing
this neural network with image capturing and processing hardware would allow
increased efficacy in OCSCC detection. The aim of our project is to develop a
Convolutional Neural Network trained to recognize OCSCC, as well as to design a
physical hardware system to capture and process detailed images, in order to
determine the image quality required for accurate predictions. A CNN was
trained on 4293 training images consisting of benign and malignant tumors, as
well as negative samples, and was evaluated for its precision, recall, and Mean
Average Precision (mAP) in its predictions of OCSCC. A testing dataset of
randomly assorted images of cancerous, non-cancerous, and negative images was
chosen, and each image was altered to represent 5 common resolutions. This test
data set was thoroughly analyzed by the CNN and predictions were scored on the
basis of accuracy. The designed enhancement hardware was used to capture
detailed images, and its impact was scored. An application was developed to
facilitate the testing process and bring open access to the CNN. Images of
increasing resolution resulted in higher-accuracy predictions on a logarithmic
scale, demonstrating the diminishing returns of higher pixel counts.

Motivation: 人类行为是场景动态的主要来源，包含丰富的动态线索。传统静态物体级重建方法存在固有模糊性，需要利用人类与物体的交互来动态优化分解和重建过程。

Method: 使用高斯泼溅技术，通过观察人-物交互来迭代式分解和重建环境，整合相机位姿估计、物体位姿估计、实例分解和在线地图更新等多个任务。

Conclusion: 该方法为传统物体级重建方法提供了一个灵活、渐进的替代方案，能够利用第一人称视角直播中的人-物交互线索进行动态场景建模。

Abstract: Human behaviors are the major causes of scene dynamics and inherently contain
rich cues regarding the dynamics. This paper formalizes a new task of proactive
scene decomposition and reconstruction, an online approach that leverages
human-object interactions to iteratively disassemble and reconstruct the
environment. By observing these intentional interactions, we can dynamically
refine the decomposition and reconstruction process, addressing inherent
ambiguities in static object-level reconstruction. The proposed system
effectively integrates multiple tasks in dynamic environments such as accurate
camera and object pose estimation, instance decomposition, and online map
updating, capitalizing on cues from human-object interactions in egocentric
live streams for a flexible, progressive alternative to conventional
object-level reconstruction methods. Aided by the Gaussian splatting technique,
accurate and consistent dynamic scene modeling is achieved with photorealistic
and efficient rendering. The efficacy is validated in multiple real-world
scenarios with promising advantages.

Conclusion: Cerberus是实时视频分析的实际解决方案，在速度和精度之间取得了良好平衡。

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) has rapidly advanced by recent development of
Vision-Language Models (VLMs). While these models offer superior zero-shot
detection capabilities, their immense computational cost and unstable visual
grounding performance hinder real-time deployment. To overcome these
challenges, we introduce Cerberus, a two-stage cascaded system designed for
efficient yet accurate real-time VAD. Cerberus learns normal behavioral rules
offline, and combines lightweight filtering with fine-grained VLM reasoning
during online inference. The performance gains of Cerberus come from two key
innovations: motion mask prompting and rule-based deviation detection. The
former directs the VLM's attention to regions relevant to motion, while the
latter identifies anomalies as deviations from learned norms rather than
enumerating possible anomalies. Extensive evaluations on four datasets show
that Cerberus on average achieves 57.68 fps on an NVIDIA L40S GPU, a
151.79$\times$ speedup, and 97.2\% accuracy comparable to the state-of-the-art
VLM-based VAD methods, establishing it as a practical solution for real-time
video analytics.

TL;DR: OpenLVLM-MIA是一个新的基准测试，揭示了评估大型视觉语言模型成员推理攻击时的根本挑战。研究发现之前的高攻击成功率主要来自检测数据集构建中的分布偏差，而非真正的成员状态识别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究报道的成员推理攻击高成功率可能源于数据集构建中的分布偏差，而非真正的攻击能力。需要建立一个无偏基准来准确评估MIA方法的有效性。

Method: 构建了包含6,000张图像的受控基准，其中成员和非成员样本的分布经过仔细平衡，并提供三个不同训练阶段的真实成员标签。

Result: 在无偏条件下，最先进的MIA方法性能收敛到随机猜测水平，表明之前的攻击成功率主要来自检测分布偏差。

Conclusion: OpenLVLM-MIA为LVLM的MIA研究提供了透明无偏的基准，澄清了当前方法的局限性，为开发更强的隐私保护技术奠定了基础。

Abstract: OpenLVLM-MIA is a new benchmark that highlights fundamental challenges in
evaluating membership inference attacks (MIA) against large vision-language
models (LVLMs). While prior work has reported high attack success rates, our
analysis suggests that these results often arise from detecting distributional
bias introduced during dataset construction rather than from identifying true
membership status. To address this issue, we introduce a controlled benchmark
of 6{,}000 images where the distributions of member and non-member samples are
carefully balanced, and ground-truth membership labels are provided across
three distinct training stages. Experiments using OpenLVLM-MIA demonstrated
that the performance of state-of-the-art MIA methods converged to random chance
under unbiased conditions. By offering a transparent and unbiased benchmark,
OpenLVLM-MIA clarifies the current limitations of MIA research on LVLMs and
provides a solid foundation for developing stronger privacy-preserving
techniques.

Conclusion: 该方法能够自适应地将参考笔画特征整合到内容图像中，同时保持结构完整性，代码已开源。

Abstract: Generating sketches guided by reference styles requires precise transfer of
stroke attributes, such as line thickness, deformation, and texture sparsity,
while preserving semantic structure and content fidelity. To this end, we
propose Stroke2Sketch, a novel training-free framework that introduces
cross-image stroke attention, a mechanism embedded within self-attention layers
to establish fine-grained semantic correspondences and enable accurate stroke
attribute transfer. This allows our method to adaptively integrate reference
stroke characteristics into content images while maintaining structural
integrity. Additionally, we develop adaptive contrast enhancement and
semantic-focused attention to reinforce content preservation and foreground
emphasis. Stroke2Sketch effectively synthesizes stylistically faithful sketches
that closely resemble handcrafted results, outperforming existing methods in
expressive stroke control and semantic coherence. Codes are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于现有数据集规模不足，无法研究深度伪造检测任务的缩放规律，因此需要构建大规模数据集来分析模型性能与真实图像域数量、深度伪造方法数量和训练图像数量之间的关系。

Method: 构建了ScaleDF数据集，包含580万张来自51个不同域的真实图像和880万张由102种深度伪造方法生成的假图像，并基于此数据集分析缩放规律。

Result: 观察到检测误差随真实域数量或深度伪造方法数量的增加呈幂律衰减，可以预测达到目标性能所需的额外域或方法数量。

Conclusion: 缩放定律为对抗不断演进的深度伪造技术提供了数据中心的解决方案，同时研究了预训练和数据增强在缩放中的作用以及缩放本身的局限性。

Abstract: This paper presents a systematic study of scaling laws for the deepfake
detection task. Specifically, we analyze the model performance against the
number of real image domains, deepfake generation methods, and training images.
Since no existing dataset meets the scale requirements for this research, we
construct ScaleDF, the largest dataset to date in this field, which contains
over 5.8 million real images from 51 different datasets (domains) and more than
8.8 million fake images generated by 102 deepfake methods. Using ScaleDF, we
observe power-law scaling similar to that shown in large language models
(LLMs). Specifically, the average detection error follows a predictable
power-law decay as either the number of real domains or the number of deepfake
methods increases. This key observation not only allows us to forecast the
number of additional real domains or deepfake methods required to reach a
target performance, but also inspires us to counter the evolving deepfake
technology in a data-centric manner. Beyond this, we examine the role of
pre-training and data augmentations in deepfake detection under scaling, as
well as the limitations of scaling itself.

Motivation: 当前扩散模型受限于注意力机制的二次复杂性和原生4K训练数据的稀缺，无法支持超高清（1K以上）文本到图像生成。

Method: 采用分层局部注意力机制，将高分辨率潜在空间划分为固定大小的局部窗口以降低注意力复杂度；使用低分辨率潜在空间提供全局语义引导；通过LoRA适配器连接全局和局部路径；采用Hilbert曲线重新排列token序列和融合内核优化推理效率。

Result: Scale-DiT相比密集注意力基线实现了2倍以上的推理加速和更低的内存使用，可靠地扩展到4K分辨率，在定量指标（FID、IS、CLIP Score）和定性比较中均表现出优异的全局一致性和局部细节清晰度。

Conclusion: 层次化局部注意力配合引导性低分辨率锚点是一种有前景且有效的方法，可推动超高清图像生成技术的发展。

Abstract: Ultra-high-resolution text-to-image generation demands both fine-grained
texture synthesis and globally coherent structure, yet current diffusion models
remain constrained to sub-$1K \times 1K$ resolutions due to the prohibitive
quadratic complexity of attention and the scarcity of native $4K$ training
data. We present \textbf{Scale-DiT}, a new diffusion framework that introduces
hierarchical local attention with low-resolution global guidance, enabling
efficient, scalable, and semantically coherent image synthesis at ultra-high
resolutions. Specifically, high-resolution latents are divided into fixed-size
local windows to reduce attention complexity from quadratic to near-linear,
while a low-resolution latent equipped with scaled positional anchors injects
global semantics. A lightweight LoRA adaptation bridges global and local
pathways during denoising, ensuring consistency across structure and detail. To
maximize inference efficiency, we repermute token sequence in Hilbert curve
order and implement a fused-kernel for skipping masked operations, resulting in
a GPU-friendly design. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Scale-DiT
achieves more than $2\times$ faster inference and lower memory usage compared
to dense attention baselines, while reliably scaling to $4K \times 4K$
resolution without requiring additional high-resolution training data. On both
quantitative benchmarks (FID, IS, CLIP Score) and qualitative comparisons,
Scale-DiT delivers superior global coherence and sharper local detail, matching
or outperforming state-of-the-art methods that rely on native 4K training.
Taken together, these results highlight hierarchical local attention with
guided low-resolution anchors as a promising and effective approach for
advancing ultra-high-resolution image generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型生成过程计算密集，用户需要多次迭代优化提示词，增加了延迟和云资源负担。

Method: 提出云边协同框架，设备端轻量扩散模型快速生成预览，云端高容量模型进行最终优化；引入噪声水平预测器动态平衡计算负载。

Result: 相比Stable Diffusion v1.5平均生成时间减少15.8%，图像质量相当；相比Tiny-SD仅慢0.9%但图像质量显著提升。

Conclusion: DiffusionX在最小开销下实现了效率和可扩展性，有效解决了多轮提示词生成的计算密集问题。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have driven remarkable progress in image
generation. However, the generation process remains computationally intensive,
and users often need to iteratively refine prompts to achieve the desired
results, further increasing latency and placing a heavy burden on cloud
resources. To address this challenge, we propose DiffusionX, a cloud-edge
collaborative framework for efficient multi-round, prompt-based generation. In
this system, a lightweight on-device diffusion model interacts with users by
rapidly producing preview images, while a high-capacity cloud model performs
final refinements after the prompt is finalized. We further introduce a noise
level predictor that dynamically balances the computation load, optimizing the
trade-off between latency and cloud workload. Experiments show that DiffusionX
reduces average generation time by 15.8% compared with Stable Diffusion v1.5,
while maintaining comparable image quality. Moreover, it is only 0.9% slower
than Tiny-SD with significantly improved image quality, thereby demonstrating
efficiency and scalability with minimal overhead.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自回归模型在多参考图像生成中难以解耦不同参考身份，存在身份混淆问题。

Method: 提出TokenAR框架，包含三个token级增强组件：1) Token Index Embedding聚类token索引；2) Instruct Token Injection注入额外视觉特征；3) 身份token解缠策略(ITD)引导token独立表示每个身份特征。

Result: 在多个参考图像生成任务中超越了当前最先进模型，实现了良好的身份一致性和高质量背景重建。

Conclusion: TokenAR框架有效解决了多参考图像生成中的身份混淆问题，并引入了首个开源大规模多参考图像生成数据集InstructAR。

Abstract: Autoregressive Model (AR) has shown remarkable success in conditional image
generation. However, these approaches for multiple reference generation
struggle with decoupling different reference identities. In this work, we
propose the TokenAR framework, specifically focused on a simple but effective
token-level enhancement mechanism to address reference identity confusion
problem. Such token-level enhancement consists of three parts, 1). Token Index
Embedding clusters the tokens index for better representing the same reference
images; 2). Instruct Token Injection plays as a role of extra visual feature
container to inject detailed and complementary priors for reference tokens; 3).
The identity-token disentanglement strategy (ITD) explicitly guides the token
representations toward independently representing the features of each
identity.This token-enhancement framework significantly augments the
capabilities of existing AR based methods in conditional image generation,
enabling good identity consistency while preserving high quality background
reconstruction. Driven by the goal of high-quality and high-diversity in
multi-subject generation, we introduce the InstructAR Dataset, the first
open-source, large-scale, multi-reference input, open domain image generation
dataset that includes 28K training pairs, each example has two reference
subjects, a relative prompt and a background with mask annotation, curated for
multiple reference image generation training and evaluating. Comprehensive
experiments validate that our approach surpasses current state-of-the-art
models in multiple reference image generation task. The implementation code and
datasets will be made publicly. Codes are available, see

*Junha Song,Sangdoo Yun,Dongyoon Han,Jaegul Choo,Byeongho Heo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文挑战了多模态语言模型(MLLM)性能主要继承自LLM骨干网络的假设，揭示了视觉编码器在RL训练范式下的重要性，并提出了PIVOT方法显著提升视觉表示能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前MLLM研究过度关注LLM骨干网络，忽视了视觉编码器的作用，特别是在从SFT转向RL的训练范式转变中，缺乏对视觉编码器如何被重塑的分析。

Method: 通过对比SFT和RL训练策略，进行从ImageNet分类、分割到梯度可视化的多样化深度实验分析，并提出了PIVOT方法优化视觉编码器。

Result: RL相比SFT能产生更强且精确定位的视觉表示，PIVOT训练的视觉编码器在MLLM中表现优于更大规模训练的对标模型，且计算成本不到标准视觉预训练的1%。

Conclusion: 视觉编码器在MLLM中具有关键作用，RL训练能显著提升其表示能力，PIVOT方法为MLLM视觉骨干的进步提供了高效路径。

Abstract: A dominant assumption in Multimodal Language Model (MLLM) research is that
its performance is largely inherited from the LLM backbone, given its immense
parameter scale and remarkable capabilities. This has created a void in the
understanding of the vision encoder, which determines how MLLMs perceive
images. The recent shift in MLLM training paradigms, from Supervised Finetuning
(SFT) to Reinforcement Learning (RL), magnifies this oversight-namely, the
significant lack of analysis on how such training reshapes the vision encoder
as well as the MLLM. To address this, we first investigate the impact of
training strategies on MLLMs, where RL shows a clear advantage over SFT in
strongly vision-related VQA benchmarks. Motivated by this, we conduct a
critical yet under-explored analysis of the vision encoder of MLLMs through
diverse and in-depth experiments, ranging from ImageNet classification and
segmentation to gradient visualization. Our results demonstrate that MLLM's
post-training strategy (i.e., SFT or RL) not only leads to distinct outcomes on
MLLM downstream tasks, but also fundamentally reshapes MLLM's underlying visual
representations. Specifically, the key finding of our study is that RL produces
stronger and precisely localized visual representations compared to SFT,
boosting the ability of the vision encoder for MLLM. We then reframe our
findings into a simple recipe for building strong vision encoders for MLLMs,
Preference-Instructed Vision OpTimization (PIVOT). When integrated into MLLMs,
a PIVOT-trained vision encoder outperforms even larger and more heavily-trained
counterparts, despite requiring less than 1% of the computational cost of
standard vision pretraining. This result opens an effective and efficient path
for advancing the vision backbones of MLLMs. Project page available at

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: This paper investigates the recently emerged problem of Language-assisted
Image Clustering (LaIC), where textual semantics are leveraged to improve the
discriminability of visual representations to facilitate image clustering. Due
to the unavailability of true class names, one of core challenges of LaIC lies
in how to filter positive nouns, i.e., those semantically close to the images
of interest, from unlabeled wild corpus data. Existing filtering strategies are
predominantly based on the off-the-shelf feature space learned by CLIP;
however, despite being intuitive, these strategies lack a rigorous theoretical
foundation. To fill this gap, we propose a novel gradient-based framework,
termed as GradNorm, which is theoretically guaranteed and shows strong
empirical performance. In particular, we measure the positiveness of each noun
based on the magnitude of gradients back-propagated from the cross-entropy
between the predicted target distribution and the softmax output.
Theoretically, we provide a rigorous error bound to quantify the separability
of positive nouns by GradNorm and prove that GradNorm naturally subsumes
existing filtering strategies as extremely special cases of itself.
Empirically, extensive experiments show that GradNorm achieves the
state-of-the-art clustering performance on various benchmarks.

Motivation: 社交制造模式带来质量控制的重大挑战，主要困难包括：产品高度定制化、生产碎片化小批量、分布式站点成像环境差异大。现有数据集和算法无法满足这些现实需求。

Method: 构建MIRAD数据集，包含三个关键维度：多样化个性化产品（大类内差异）、六个地理分散制造节点的数据采集、显著的成像异质性（光照、背景、运动条件变化）。

Result: 对SOTA异常检测方法（单类、多类、零样本）进行广泛评估，结果显示所有模型相比传统基准都出现显著性能下降，突显了个性化生产中缺陷检测的未解决复杂性。

Conclusion: MIRAD通过连接工业需求和学术研究，为开发工业5.0所需的稳健质量控制解决方案提供了现实基础，数据集已公开可用。

Abstract: Social manufacturing leverages community collaboration and scattered
resources to realize mass individualization in modern industry. However, this
paradigm shift also introduces substantial challenges in quality control,
particularly in defect detection. The main difficulties stem from three
aspects. First, products often have highly customized configurations. Second,
production typically involves fragmented, small-batch orders. Third, imaging
environments vary considerably across distributed sites. To overcome the
scarcity of real-world datasets and tailored algorithms, we introduce the Mass
Individualization Robust Anomaly Detection (MIRAD) dataset. As the first
benchmark explicitly designed for anomaly detection in social manufacturing,
MIRAD captures three critical dimensions of this domain: (1) diverse
individualized products with large intra-class variation, (2) data collected
from six geographically dispersed manufacturing nodes, and (3) substantial
imaging heterogeneity, including variations in lighting, background, and motion
conditions. We then conduct extensive evaluations of state-of-the-art (SOTA)
anomaly detection methods on MIRAD, covering one-class, multi-class, and
zero-shot approaches. Results show a significant performance drop across all
models compared with conventional benchmarks, highlighting the unresolved
complexities of defect detection in real-world individualized production. By
bridging industrial requirements and academic research, MIRAD provides a
realistic foundation for developing robust quality control solutions essential
for Industry 5.0. The dataset is publicly available at

Abstract: The development of computer-assisted surgery systems depends on large-scale,
annotated datasets. Current resources for cataract surgery often lack the
diversity and annotation depth needed to train generalizable deep-learning
models. To address this gap, we present a dataset of 3,000 phacoemulsification
cataract surgery videos from two surgical centers, performed by surgeons with a
range of experience levels. This resource is enriched with four annotation
layers: temporal surgical phases, instance segmentation of instruments and
anatomical structures, instrument-tissue interaction tracking, and quantitative
skill scores based on the established competency rubrics like the ICO-OSCAR.
The technical quality of the dataset is supported by a series of benchmarking
experiments for key surgical AI tasks, including workflow recognition, scene

Abstract: Learning 3D parametric shape models of objects has gained popularity in
vision and graphics and has showed broad utility in 3D reconstruction,
generation, understanding, and simulation. While powerful models exist for
humans and animals, equally expressive approaches for modeling plants are
lacking. In this work, we present Demeter, a data-driven parametric model that
encodes key factors of a plant morphology, including topology, shape,
articulation, and deformation into a compact learned representation. Unlike
previous parametric models, Demeter handles varying shape topology across
various species and models three sources of shape variation: articulation,
subcomponent shape variation, and non-rigid deformation. To advance crop plant
modeling, we collected a large-scale, ground-truthed dataset from a soybean
farm as a testbed. Experiments show that Demeter effectively synthesizes
shapes, reconstructs structures, and simulates biophysical processes. Code and

Conclusion: 该方法在保持与最先进方法相当精度的同时，显著提升了计算效率，适用于AR/VR边缘设备的实时手部姿态估计。

Abstract: With the increasing ubiquity of AR/VR devices, the deployment of deep
learning models on edge devices has become a critical challenge. These devices
require real-time inference, low power consumption, and minimal latency. Many
framework designers face the conundrum of balancing efficiency and performance.
We design a light framework that adopts an encoder-decoder architecture and
introduces several key contributions aimed at improving both efficiency and
accuracy. We apply sparse convolution on a ResNet-18 backbone to exploit the
inherent sparsity in hand pose images, achieving a 42% end-to-end efficiency
improvement. Moreover, we propose our SPLite decoder. This new architecture
significantly boosts the decoding process's frame rate by 3.1x on the Raspberry
Pi 5, while maintaining accuracy on par. To further optimize performance, we
apply quantization-aware training, reducing memory usage while preserving
accuracy (PA-MPJPE increases only marginally from 9.0 mm to 9.1 mm on
FreiHAND). Overall, our system achieves a 2.98x speed-up on a Raspberry Pi 5

Abstract: Bridging the gap between complex human instructions and precise 3D object
grounding remains a significant challenge in vision and robotics. Existing 3D
segmentation methods often struggle to interpret ambiguous, reasoning-based
instructions, while 2D vision-language models that excel at such reasoning lack
intrinsic 3D spatial understanding. In this paper, we introduce REALM, an
innovative MLLM-agent framework that enables open-world reasoning-based
segmentation without requiring extensive 3D-specific post-training. We perform
segmentation directly on 3D Gaussian Splatting representations, capitalizing on
their ability to render photorealistic novel views that are highly suitable for
MLLM comprehension. As directly feeding one or more rendered views to the MLLM
can lead to high sensitivity to viewpoint selection, we propose a novel
Global-to-Local Spatial Grounding strategy. Specifically, multiple global views
are first fed into the MLLM agent in parallel for coarse-level localization,
aggregating responses to robustly identify the target object. Then, several
close-up novel views of the object are synthesized to perform fine-grained
local segmentation, yielding accurate and consistent 3D masks. Extensive
experiments show that REALM achieves remarkable performance in interpreting
both explicit and implicit instructions across LERF, 3D-OVS, and our newly
introduced REALM3D benchmarks. Furthermore, our agent framework seamlessly
supports a range of 3D interaction tasks, including object removal,
replacement, and style transfer, demonstrating its practical utility and
versatility. Project page: https://ChangyueShi.github.io/REALM.

Motivation: 视觉语言模型在视觉中心任务中过度依赖语言先验，在推理过程中使用文本捷径，缺乏可扩展可靠的奖励机制阻碍了强化学习的应用。

Conclusion: SSL4RL建立了一个使用可验证自监督目标对齐多模态模型的通用有效范式，为未来工作提供了新的设计原则。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown remarkable abilities by integrating
large language models with visual inputs. However, they often fail to utilize
visual evidence adequately, either depending on linguistic priors in
vision-centric tasks or resorting to textual shortcuts during reasoning.
Although reinforcement learning (RL) can align models with desired behaviors,
its application to VLMs has been hindered by the lack of scalable and reliable
reward mechanisms. To overcome this challenge, we propose SSL4RL, a novel
framework that leverages self-supervised learning (SSL) tasks as a source of
verifiable rewards for RL-based fine-tuning. Our approach reformulates SSL
objectives-such as predicting image rotation or reconstructing masked
patches-into dense, automatic reward signals, eliminating the need for human
preference data or unreliable AI evaluators. Experiments show that SSL4RL
substantially improves performance on both vision-centric and vision-language
reasoning benchmarks. Furthermore, through systematic ablations, we identify
key factors-such as task difficulty, model scale, and semantic alignment with
the target domain-that influence the effectiveness of SSL4RL tasks, offering
new design principles for future work. We also demonstrate the framework's
generality by applying it to graph learning, where it yields significant gains.
SSL4RL establishes a versatile and effective paradigm for aligning multimodal
models using verifiable, self-supervised objectives.

Motivation: 传统的点和线匹配被视为独立任务，虽然GlueStick提出了同时处理点和线的GNN网络，但其重型架构阻碍了实时应用和边缘设备部署。

Method: 采用注意力线消息传递(ALMP)组件，显式暴露线的连通性到网络中，实现节点间高效通信，构建轻量级匹配器。

Result: 在多个基准测试中建立了新的最先进性能，同时保持了轻量级架构。

Conclusion: LightGlueStick通过ALMP机制有效解决了点和线联合匹配的计算复杂度问题，为实时应用和边缘设备部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Lines and points are complementary local features, whose combination has
proven effective for applications such as SLAM and Structure-from-Motion. The
backbone of these pipelines are the local feature matchers, establishing
correspondences across images. Traditionally, point and line matching have been
treated as independent tasks. Recently, GlueStick proposed a GNN-based network
that simultaneously operates on points and lines to establish matches. While
running a single joint matching reduced the overall computational complexity,
the heavy architecture prevented real-time applications or deployment to edge
devices.
  Inspired by recent progress in point matching, we propose LightGlueStick, a
lightweight matcher for points and line segments. The key novel component in
our architecture is the Attentional Line Message Passing (ALMP), which
explicitly exposes the connectivity of the lines to the network, allowing for
efficient communication between nodes. In thorough experiments we show that
LightGlueStick establishes a new state-of-the-art across different benchmarks.

Abstract: The rapid development of deepfake video technology has not only facilitated
artistic creation but also made it easier to spread misinformation. Traditional
deepfake video detection (DVD) methods face issues such as a lack of
transparency in their principles and insufficient generalization capabilities
to cope with evolving forgery techniques. This highlights an urgent need for
detectors that can identify forged content and provide verifiable reasoning
explanations. This paper proposes the explainable deepfake video detection
(EDVD) task and designs the EDVD-LLaMA multimodal, a large language model
(MLLM) reasoning framework, which provides traceable reasoning processes
alongside accurate detection results and trustworthy explanations. Our approach
first incorporates a Spatio-Temporal Subtle Information Tokenization (ST-SIT)
to extract and fuse global and local cross-frame deepfake features, providing
rich spatio-temporal semantic information input for MLLM reasoning. Second, we
construct a Fine-grained Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (Fg-MCoT) mechanism, which
introduces facial feature data as hard constraints during the reasoning process
to achieve pixel-level spatio-temporal video localization, suppress
hallucinated outputs, and enhance the reliability of the chain of thought. In
addition, we build an Explainable Reasoning FF++ benchmark dataset
(ER-FF++set), leveraging structured data to annotate videos and ensure quality
control, thereby supporting dual supervision for reasoning and detection.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that EDVD-LLaMA achieves outstanding
performance and robustness in terms of detection accuracy, explainability, and
its ability to handle cross-forgery methods and cross-dataset scenarios.
Compared to previous DVD methods, it provides a more explainable and superior
solution. The source code and dataset will be publicly available.

Abstract: Referring Atomic Video Action Recognition (RAVAR) aims to recognize
fine-grained, atomic-level actions of a specific person of interest conditioned
on natural language descriptions. Distinct from conventional action recognition
and detection tasks, RAVAR emphasizes precise language-guided action
understanding, which is particularly critical for interactive human action
analysis in complex multi-person scenarios. In this work, we extend our
previously introduced RefAVA dataset to RefAVA++, which comprises >2.9 million
frames and >75.1k annotated persons in total. We benchmark this dataset using
baselines from multiple related domains, including atomic action localization,
video question answering, and text-video retrieval, as well as our earlier
model, RefAtomNet. Although RefAtomNet surpasses other baselines by
incorporating agent attention to highlight salient features, its ability to
align and retrieve cross-modal information remains limited, leading to
suboptimal performance in localizing the target person and predicting
fine-grained actions. To overcome the aforementioned limitations, we introduce
RefAtomNet++, a novel framework that advances cross-modal token aggregation
through a multi-hierarchical semantic-aligned cross-attention mechanism
combined with multi-trajectory Mamba modeling at the partial-keyword,
scene-attribute, and holistic-sentence levels. In particular, scanning
trajectories are constructed by dynamically selecting the nearest visual
spatial tokens at each timestep for both partial-keyword and scene-attribute
levels. Moreover, we design a multi-hierarchical semantic-aligned
cross-attention strategy, enabling more effective aggregation of spatial and
temporal tokens across different semantic hierarchies. Experiments show that
RefAtomNet++ establishes new state-of-the-art results. The dataset and code are
released at https://github.com/KPeng9510/refAVA2.

Abstract: Detecting rotated objects accurately and efficiently is a significant
challenge in computer vision, particularly in applications such as aerial
imagery, remote sensing, and autonomous driving. Although traditional object
detection frameworks are effective for axis-aligned objects, they often
underperform in scenarios involving rotated objects due to their limitations in
capturing orientation variations. This paper introduces an improved loss
function aimed at enhancing detection accuracy and robustness by leveraging the
Gaussian bounding box representation and Bhattacharyya distance. In addition,
we advocate for the use of an anisotropic Gaussian representation to address
the issues associated with isotropic variance in square-like objects. Our
proposed method addresses these challenges by incorporating a
rotation-invariant loss function that effectively captures the geometric
properties of rotated objects. We integrate this proposed loss function into
state-of-the-art deep learning-based rotated object detection detectors, and
extensive experiments demonstrated significant improvements in mean Average
Precision metrics compared to existing methods. The results highlight the
potential of our approach to establish new benchmark in rotated object
detection, with implications for a wide range of applications requiring precise
and reliable object localization irrespective of orientation.

TL;DR: VIPAMIN是一种视觉提示初始化策略，通过将提示与嵌入空间中的语义信息区域对齐并注入新的表示方向，来增强自监督模型的适应能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在基础模型时代，对每个下游任务完全微调预训练网络通常资源消耗巨大。现有的视觉提示调优方法在应用于自监督骨干网络时，往往无法专门化提示或丰富表示空间，特别是在具有挑战性的任务和数据稀缺设置中。

Method: VIPAMIN通过(1)将提示与嵌入空间中的语义信息区域对齐，(2)在预训练子空间之外注入新的表示方向，来增强自监督模型的适应。该方法只需要单次前向传播和轻量级操作。

Result: VIPAMIN在不同任务和数据集大小上持续提升性能，在视觉提示调优领域达到了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: VIPAMIN是一种简单有效的视觉提示初始化策略，能够显著提升自监督模型在下游任务中的适应性能，特别是在挑战性任务和数据稀缺场景中。

Abstract: In the era of large-scale foundation models, fully fine-tuning pretrained
networks for each downstream task is often prohibitively resource-intensive.
Prompt tuning offers a lightweight alternative by introducing tunable prompts
while keeping the backbone frozen. However, existing visual prompt tuning
methods often fail to specialize the prompts or enrich the representation
space--especially when applied to self-supervised backbones. We show that these
limitations become especially pronounced in challenging tasks and data-scarce
settings, where effective adaptation is most critical. In this work, we
introduce VIPAMIN, a visual prompt initialization strategy that enhances
adaptation of self-supervised models by (1) aligning prompts with semantically
informative regions in the embedding space, and (2) injecting novel
representational directions beyond the pretrained subspace. Despite its
simplicity--requiring only a single forward pass and lightweight
operations--VIPAMIN consistently improves performance across diverse tasks and
dataset sizes, setting a new state of the art in visual prompt tuning. Our code

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种弱监督领域自适应方法，利用稀疏点标注来改进电子显微镜图像中线粒体分割的性能，通过多任务学习和实例感知伪标签选择策略显著提升分割效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子显微镜图像中线粒体分割需要大量标注，而无监督领域自适应方法在实际应用中性能较低。为解决这一问题，研究利用稀疏点标注的弱监督领域自适应方法，以最小标注成本提升分割性能。

Method: 提出多任务学习框架，联合进行分割和中心检测，采用交叉教学机制和类聚焦跨域对比学习。引入实例感知伪标签选择策略，通过检测任务语义选择可靠且多样的伪标签。

Result: 在多个挑战性数据集上的验证表明，该方法优于现有的无监督和弱监督领域自适应方法，显著缩小了与监督上界的性能差距。在无监督设置下也大幅优于其他无监督技术。

Conclusion: 该方法通过有效利用稀疏点标注和多任务学习，实现了高效的线粒体分割，为生物和神经科学研究提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Annotation-efficient segmentation of the numerous mitochondria instances from
various electron microscopy (EM) images is highly valuable for biological and
neuroscience research. Although unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods
can help mitigate domain shifts and reduce the high costs of annotating each
domain, they typically have relatively low performance in practical
applications. Thus, we investigate weakly supervised domain adaptation (WDA)
that utilizes additional sparse point labels on the target domain, which
require minimal annotation effort and minimal expert knowledge. To take full
use of the incomplete and imprecise point annotations, we introduce a multitask
learning framework that jointly conducts segmentation and center detection with
a novel cross-teaching mechanism and class-focused cross-domain contrastive
learning. While leveraging unlabeled image regions is essential, we introduce
segmentation self-training with a novel instance-aware pseudo-label (IPL)
selection strategy. Unlike existing methods that typically rely on pixel-wise
pseudo-label filtering, the IPL semantically selects reliable and diverse
pseudo-labels with the help of the detection task. Comprehensive validations
and comparisons on challenging datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms
existing UDA and WDA methods, significantly narrowing the performance gap with
the supervised upper bound. Furthermore, under the UDA setting, our method also
achieves substantial improvements over other UDA techniques.

Motivation: 现有方法主要基于历史信息做决策，忽略了行动的未来影响和长期结果，需要开发具有前瞻性的导航智能体。

Method: 使用Q学习训练Q模型生成Q特征描述候选行动的未来潜在信息，通过跨模态未来编码器将任务无关的Q特征与导航指令结合，生成反映未来前景的行动评分，结合历史评分进行A*式搜索。

Conclusion: 该方法通过整合未来信息显著提升了目标导向视觉语言导航的性能，证明了前瞻性决策在复杂导航任务中的重要性。

Abstract: In this work we concentrate on the task of goal-oriented Vision-and-Language
Navigation (VLN). Existing methods often make decisions based on historical
information, overlooking the future implications and long-term outcomes of the
actions. In contrast, we aim to develop a foresighted agent. Specifically, we
draw upon Q-learning to train a Q-model using large-scale unlabeled trajectory
data, in order to learn the general knowledge regarding the layout and object
relations within indoor scenes. This model can generate a Q-feature, analogous
to the Q-value in traditional Q-network, for each candidate action, which
describes the potential future information that may be observed after taking
the specific action. Subsequently, a cross-modal future encoder integrates the
task-agnostic Q-feature with navigation instructions to produce a set of action
scores reflecting future prospects. These scores, when combined with the
original scores based on history, facilitate an A*-style searching strategy to
effectively explore the regions that are more likely to lead to the
destination. Extensive experiments conducted on widely used goal-oriented VLN
datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于3D高斯飞溅的压缩方法缺乏人体先验知识，导致在数字人编码和传输中比特率效率和重建质量不理想，难以应用于可流式传输的3D虚拟角色系统。

Method: 将高斯表示解耦为结构层（通过StyleUNet生成器将姿态映射到高斯）和运动层（利用SMPL-X模型紧凑表示时序姿态变化），支持分层压缩、渐进解码和可控渲染，并引入面部注意力机制保护身份和表情细节。

Result: 实验结果表明HGC-Avatar为快速3D虚拟角色渲染提供了可流式传输解决方案，在视觉质量和压缩效率方面显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: HGC-Avatar通过分层设计和人体先验知识的利用，成功解决了动态3D虚拟角色在低比特率传输中的压缩效率和渲染质量问题。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have enabled fast,
photorealistic rendering of dynamic 3D scenes, showing strong potential in
immersive communication. However, in digital human encoding and transmission,
the compression methods based on general 3DGS representations are limited by
the lack of human priors, resulting in suboptimal bitrate efficiency and
reconstruction quality at the decoder side, which hinders their application in
streamable 3D avatar systems. We propose HGC-Avatar, a novel Hierarchical
Gaussian Compression framework designed for efficient transmission and
high-quality rendering of dynamic avatars. Our method disentangles the Gaussian
representation into a structural layer, which maps poses to Gaussians via a
StyleUNet-based generator, and a motion layer, which leverages the SMPL-X model
to represent temporal pose variations compactly and semantically. This
hierarchical design supports layer-wise compression, progressive decoding, and
controllable rendering from diverse pose inputs such as video sequences or
text. Since people are most concerned with facial realism, we incorporate a
facial attention mechanism during StyleUNet training to preserve identity and
expression details under low-bitrate constraints. Experimental results
demonstrate that HGC-Avatar provides a streamable solution for rapid 3D avatar
rendering, while significantly outperforming prior methods in both visual
quality and compression efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试要么孤立处理单一模态，要么依赖合成错误，无法捕捉真实世界科学论文中跨文本、图表、方程的多模态不一致性，这影响了科学研究的清晰度、可复现性和可信度。

Method: 通过多阶段流程（审稿挖掘、LLM辅助过滤和人工验证）收集真实不一致案例，设计三个任务：不一致识别、修正和配对匹配，并引入结构化JSON答案表示以减少选择题评估中的捷径问题。

Result: 对21个领先LMM模型的评估显示性能极低（26.1-54.2%），包括大型开源模型（GLM-4.5V 106B, InternVL3 78B）和专有模型（Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT-5），凸显了多模态科学推理的挑战。

Conclusion: 当前LMM模型在科学论文多模态不一致性理解和推理方面表现不佳，需要进一步开发可信赖的科学助手。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) are increasingly applied to scientific
research, yet it remains unclear whether they can reliably understand and
reason over the multimodal complexity of papers. A central challenge lies in
detecting and resolving inconsistencies across text, figures, tables, and
equations, issues that are often subtle, domain-specific, and ultimately
undermine clarity, reproducibility, and trust. Existing benchmarks overlook
this issue, either isolating single modalities or relying on synthetic errors
that fail to capture real-world complexity. We introduce PRISMM-Bench
(Peer-Review-sourced Inconsistency Set for Multimodal Models), the first
benchmark grounded in real reviewer-flagged inconsistencies in scientific
papers. Through a multi-stage pipeline of review mining, LLM-assisted filtering
and human verification, we curate 262 inconsistencies from 242 papers. Based on
this set, we design three tasks, namely inconsistency identification, remedy
and pair matching, which assess a model's capacity to detect, correct, and
reason over inconsistencies across different modalities. Furthermore, to
address the notorious problem of choice-only shortcuts in multiple-choice
evaluation, where models exploit answer patterns without truly understanding
the question, we further introduce structured JSON-based answer representations
that minimize linguistic biases by reducing reliance on superficial stylistic
cues. We benchmark 21 leading LMMs, including large open-weight models
(GLM-4.5V 106B, InternVL3 78B) and proprietary models (Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT-5
with high reasoning). Results reveal strikingly low performance (26.1-54.2%),
underscoring the challenge of multimodal scientific reasoning and motivating
progress towards trustworthy scientific assistants.

Result: 实验结果显示，该方法在缺货检测任务上比现有最佳方法提升1.8% mAP。消融研究证实辅助学习提升3.7% mAP，深度归一化提升4.2% mAP。

Conclusion: OOS-DSD通过多任务辅助学习有效提升了缺货检测性能，深度归一化对训练稳定性有重要贡献，为零售验证提供了更准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Out-of-stock (OOS) detection is a very important retail verification process
that aims to infer the unavailability of products in their designated areas on
the shelf. In this paper, we introduce OOS-DSD, a novel deep learning-based
method that advances OOS detection through auxiliary learning. In particular,
we extend a well-established YOLOv8 object detection architecture with
additional convolutional branches to simultaneously detect OOS, segment
products, and estimate scene depth. While OOS detection and product
segmentation branches are trained using ground truth data, the depth estimation
branch is trained using pseudo-labeled annotations produced by the
state-of-the-art (SOTA) depth estimation model Depth Anything V2. Furthermore,
since the aforementioned pseudo-labeled depth estimates display relative depth,
we propose an appropriate depth normalization procedure that stabilizes the
training process. The experimental results show that the proposed method
surpassed the performance of the SOTA OOS detection methods by 1.8% of the mean
average precision (mAP). In addition, ablation studies confirm the
effectiveness of auxiliary learning and the proposed depth normalization
procedure, with the former increasing mAP by 3.7% and the latter by 4.2%.

Conclusion: 提出的基于图注意力网络自编码器的代表性中心方法在图像分类和检索任务中表现出良好效果。

Abstract: We propose a method for image categorization and retrieval that leverages
graphs and a graph attention network (GAT)-based autoencoder. Our approach is
representative-centric, that is, we execute the categorization and retrieval
process via the representative models we construct for the images and image
categories. We utilize a graph where nodes represent images (or their
representatives) and edges capture similarity relationships. GAT highlights
important features and relationships between images, enabling the autoencoder
to construct context-aware latent representations that capture the key features
of each image relative to its neighbors. We obtain category representatives
from these embeddings and categorize a query image by comparing its
representative to the category representatives. We then retrieve the most
similar image to the query image within its identified category. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of our representative-centric approach through experiments
with both the GAT autoencoders and standard feature-based techniques.

TL;DR: READ是一种微调方法，通过添加token级重建和句子级对齐两个辅助目标来增强视觉语言模型的组合推理能力，在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准对比训练的目标函数导致文本编码器倾向于关注单个单词而非它们之间的关系，限制了模型理解视觉和语言元素结构化关系的能力。

Method: READ方法在对比学习基础上添加两个辅助目标：(1) token级重建目标，使用冻结的预训练解码器基于原始标题嵌入重建替代标题；(2) 句子级对齐目标，在嵌入空间中显式对齐释义句子。

Result: READ-CLIP在五个主要组合推理基准测试中达到最先进性能，比最强传统微调基线提升高达4.1%。应用于现有CLIP变体也能提升性能。

Conclusion: 重建和对齐目标提供互补优势：重建鼓励编码器捕捉标题内单词间关系，对齐确保不同措辞的释义具有一致表示。

Abstract: Despite recent advances, vision-language models trained with standard
contrastive objectives still struggle with compositional reasoning -- the
ability to understand structured relationships between visual and linguistic
elements. This shortcoming is largely due to the tendency of the text encoder
to focus on individual words rather than their relations, a limitation
reinforced by contrastive training that primarily aligns words with visual
objects. In this paper, we introduce REconstruction and Alignment of text
Descriptions (READ), a fine-tuning method designed to enhance compositional
reasoning by adding two auxiliary objectives to the contrastive learning: (1) a
token-level reconstruction objective, where a frozen pre-trained decoder
reconstructs alternative captions based on the embedding of the original
caption; and (2) a sentence-level alignment objective, which explicitly aligns
paraphrased sentences in the embedding space. We show that READ-CLIP, a model
derived by applying the READ method to the pre-trained CLIP model, achieves the
state-of-the-art performance across five major compositional reasoning
benchmarks, outperforming the strongest conventional fine-tuning baseline by up
to 4.1%. Furthermore, applying the READ to existing CLIP variants (including
NegCLIP and FSC-CLIP) also improves performance on these benchmarks.
Quantitative and qualitative analyses reveal that our proposed objectives --
reconstruction and alignment -- offer complementary benefits: the former
encourages the encoder to capture relationships between words within a caption,
while the latter ensures consistent representations for paraphrases expressed
with different wording.

Method: 提出区域感知动态聚合与激励框架(GaitRDAE)，包含两个核心模块：RDA模块动态搜索每个区域的最佳时间感受野，RDE模块强调包含稳定行为模式的运动区域学习，同时抑制对易受协变量影响的静态区域的关注。

Conclusion: GaitRDAE通过动态搜索运动区域和自适应时间尺度分配，有效提升了步态识别的准确性，特别是在处理协变量影响时表现优异。

Abstract: Deep learning-based gait recognition has achieved great success in various
applications. The key to accurate gait recognition lies in considering the
unique and diverse behavior patterns in different motion regions, especially
when covariates affect visual appearance. However, existing methods typically
use predefined regions for temporal modeling, with fixed or equivalent temporal
scales assigned to different types of regions, which makes it difficult to
model motion regions that change dynamically over time and adapt to their
specific patterns. To tackle this problem, we introduce a Region-aware Dynamic
Aggregation and Excitation framework (GaitRDAE) that automatically searches for
motion regions, assigns adaptive temporal scales and applies corresponding
attention. Specifically, the framework includes two core modules: the
Region-aware Dynamic Aggregation (RDA) module, which dynamically searches the
optimal temporal receptive field for each region, and the Region-aware Dynamic
Excitation (RDE) module, which emphasizes the learning of motion regions
containing more stable behavior patterns while suppressing attention to static
regions that are more susceptible to covariates. Experimental results show that
GaitRDAE achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets.

Motivation: AI生成内容的快速扩散加剧了虚假信息风险，特别是政治深度伪造会扭曲真相、破坏政治机构信任。现有检测模型大多基于实验室合成数据训练，难以泛化到真实社交媒体上传播的政治深度伪造内容。

Method: 基于政治深度伪造事件数据库构建系统基准，对学术界、政府和工业界的最先进深度伪造检测器进行系统性评估，包括免费和付费工具。

Conclusion: 需要开发政治情境化的深度伪造检测框架，以在真实世界环境中更好地保护公众。

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of AI-generated content, driven by advances in
generative adversarial networks, diffusion models, and multimodal large
language models, has made the creation and dissemination of synthetic media
effortless, heightening the risks of misinformation, particularly political
deepfakes that distort truth and undermine trust in political institutions. In
turn, governments, research institutions, and industry have strongly promoted
deepfake detection initiatives as solutions. Yet, most existing models are
trained and validated on synthetic, laboratory-controlled datasets, limiting
their generalizability to the kinds of real-world political deepfakes
circulating on social platforms that affect the public. In this work, we
introduce the first systematic benchmark based on the Political Deepfakes
Incident Database, a curated collection of real-world political deepfakes
shared on social media since 2018. Our study includes a systematic evaluation
of state-of-the-art deepfake detectors across academia, government, and
industry. We find that the detectors from academia and government perform
relatively poorly. While paid detection tools achieve relatively higher

*Yiyang Huang,Liang Shi,Yitian Zhang,Yi Xu,Yun Fu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SHIELD是一个无需训练的框架，通过重新加权视觉标记、引入噪声衍生标记和对比解码对抗攻击，有效缓解大型视觉语言模型中的物体幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在跨模态任务中表现出色，但物体幻觉问题（模型产生看似合理但不准确的物体描述）仍然是一个重大挑战。与之前关注LLM组件的研究不同，本文首次将LVLM幻觉追溯到视觉编码器，并识别出三个关键问题：统计偏差、固有偏差和脆弱性。

Method: 提出SHIELD框架，包含三种策略：1）重新加权视觉标记以减少统计偏差；2）引入噪声衍生标记来对抗固有偏差；3）应用对抗攻击和对比解码来解决脆弱性问题。

Result: 实验表明，SHIELD在各种基准测试和LVLM家族中有效缓解了物体幻觉问题。同时，在通用LVLM基准测试中表现出色，证明了其广泛适用性。

Conclusion: SHIELD是一个无需训练的有效框架，能够显著减少大型视觉语言模型中的物体幻觉，同时保持模型的通用性能，具有广泛的适用性。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) excel in diverse cross-modal tasks.
However, object hallucination, where models produce plausible but inaccurate
object descriptions, remains a significant challenge. In contrast to previous
work focusing on LLM components, this paper is the first to trace LVLM
hallucinations to visual encoders and identifies three key issues: statistical
bias, inherent bias, and vulnerability. To address these challenges, we propose
SHIELD, a training-free framework that mitigates hallucinations through three
strategies: re-weighting visual tokens to reduce statistical bias, introducing
noise-derived tokens to counter inherent bias, and applying adversarial attacks
with contrastive decoding to address vulnerability. Experiments demonstrate
that SHIELD effectively mitigates object hallucinations across diverse
benchmarks and LVLM families. Moreover, SHIELD achieves strong performance on
the general LVLM benchmark, highlighting its broad applicability. Code will be
released.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VisionSelector是一个轻量级的即插即用框架，通过可学习的决策过程解决多模态大语言模型中视觉令牌压缩问题，使用可微分Top-K机制和课程退火策略实现高效自适应令牌选择。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在处理高分辨率图像或多图像输入时面临计算和内存瓶颈，现有令牌压缩技术受限于启发式规则，可能丢弃关键信息并存在注意力沉没问题。

Method: 提出VisionSelector评分器模块，与MLLM主干解耦，包含可微分Top-K机制和课程退火策略，实现端到端可学习的令牌压缩决策过程。

Result: 仅需12.85M可训练参数，在MME基准上保持100%准确率（30%保留预算），在10%保留预算下优于先前方法12.14%，预填充速度翻倍。

Conclusion: VisionSelector在各种压缩率下都表现出优越性能，能够自适应识别关键令牌，为MLLM提供高效且通用的令牌压缩解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) encounter significant computational
and memory bottlenecks from the massive number of visual tokens generated by
high-resolution images or multi-image inputs. Previous token compression
techniques are often constrained by heuristic rules that risk discarding
critical information. They may suffer from biases, such as attention sinks,
that lead to sharp performance drops under aggressive compression ratios. To
address these limitations, we reformulate token compression as a lightweight
plug-and-play framework that reformulates token compression into an end-to-end
learnable decision process. To be specific, we propose VisionSelector, a scorer
module decoupled from the MLLM backbone that incorporates a differentiable
Top-K mechanism and a curriculum annealing strategy to bridge the
training-inference gap, enabling efficient and adaptive token selection various
arbitrary compression rates. Remarkably lightweight with only 12.85M trainable
parameters, VisionSelector demonstrates generalization across various
compression rates and adaptively identifying critical tokens. This leads to
superior performance across all compression budgets, evidenced by preserving
100% accuracy on MME with 30% retention budget, outperforming prior methods by
12.14% at 10% retention budget, and doubling prefill speed. Our code is
available at https://github.com/JulietChoo/VisionSelector .

Abstract: Medical imaging plays a vital role in modern diagnostics; however,
interpreting high-resolution radiological data remains time-consuming and
susceptible to variability among clinicians. Traditional image processing
techniques often lack the precision, robustness, and speed required for
real-time clinical use. To overcome these limitations, this paper introduces a
deep learning framework for real-time medical image analysis designed to
enhance diagnostic accuracy and computational efficiency across multiple
imaging modalities, including X-ray, CT, and MRI. The proposed system
integrates advanced neural network architectures such as U-Net, EfficientNet,

Experimental evaluations on public benchmark datasets demonstrate
state-of-the-art performance, achieving classification accuracies above 92%,
segmentation Dice scores exceeding 91%, and inference times below 80
milliseconds. Furthermore, visual explanation tools such as Grad-CAM and
segmentation overlays enhance transparency and clinical interpretability. These
results indicate that the proposed framework can substantially accelerate
diagnostic workflows, reduce clinician workload, and support trustworthy AI
integration in time-critical healthcare environments.

Abstract: This paper presents a vision-only autonomous flight system for small UAVs
operating in controlled indoor environments. The system combines semantic
segmentation with monocular depth estimation to enable obstacle avoidance,
scene exploration, and autonomous safe landing operations without requiring GPS
or expensive sensors such as LiDAR. A key innovation is an adaptive scale
factor algorithm that converts non-metric monocular depth predictions into
accurate metric distance measurements by leveraging semantic ground plane
detection and camera intrinsic parameters, achieving a mean distance error of
14.4 cm. The approach uses a knowledge distillation framework where a
color-based Support Vector Machine (SVM) teacher generates training data for a
lightweight U-Net student network (1.6M parameters) capable of real-time
semantic segmentation. For more complex environments, the SVM teacher can be
replaced with a state-of-the-art segmentation model. Testing was conducted in a
controlled 5x4 meter laboratory environment with eight cardboard obstacles
simulating urban structures. Extensive validation across 30 flight tests in a
real-world environment and 100 flight tests in a digital-twin environment
demonstrates that the combined segmentation and depth approach increases the
distance traveled during surveillance and reduces mission time while
maintaining 100% success rates. The system is further optimized through
end-to-end learning, where a compact student neural network learns complete
flight policies from demonstration data generated by our best-performing
method, achieving an 87.5% autonomous mission success rate. This work advances
practical vision-based drone navigation in structured environments,
demonstrating solutions for metric depth estimation and computational
efficiency challenges that enable deployment on resource-constrained platforms.

TL;DR: MultiVerse是一个新颖的多轮对话基准测试，包含647个对话，涵盖12个流行VLM评估基准的484个任务，使用GPT-4o作为自动评估器对18个VLM进行评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多轮对话数据集（如MMDU、ConvBench）仅部分覆盖用户遇到的各种对话场景，需要更全面的多轮对话评估基准来测试VLMs在实际应用中的能力。

Method: 从12个流行VLM评估基准中提取647个对话，每个对话平均4轮；提出基于检查表的评估方法，使用GPT-4o作为自动评估器，测量37个关键方面的性能。

Result: 评估18个VLMs显示，即使最强模型（如GPT-4o）在复杂多轮对话中也仅达到50%的成功率；提供完整对话上下文显著提升较小或较弱模型的性能。

Conclusion: MultiVerse是评估VLMs多轮交互能力的全面基准，揭示了当前模型在多轮对话中的局限性，并强调了上下文学习的重要性。

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Models (VLMs) have shown impressive capabilities on
single-turn benchmarks, yet real-world applications often demand more intricate
multi-turn dialogues. Existing multi-turn datasets (e.g, MMDU, ConvBench) only
partially capture the breadth and depth of conversational scenarios encountered
by users. In this work, we introduce MultiVerse, a novel multi-turn
conversation benchmark featuring 647 dialogues - each averaging four turns -
derived from a diverse set of 12 popular VLM evaluation benchmarks. With 484
tasks and 484 interaction goals, MultiVerse covers a wide range of topics, from
factual knowledge and perception to advanced reasoning tasks such as
mathematics and coding. To facilitate robust assessment, we propose a
checklist-based evaluation method that leverages GPT-4o as the automated
evaluator, measuring performance across 37 key aspects, including perceptual
accuracy, linguistic clarity, and factual correctness. We evaluate 18 VLMs on
MultiVerse, revealing that even the strongest models (e.g., GPT-4o) achieve
only a 50% success rate in complex multi-turn conversations, highlighting the
dataset's challenging nature. Notably, we find that providing full dialogue
context significantly enhances performance for smaller or weaker models,
emphasizing the importance of in-context learning. We believe MultiVerse is a
landscape of evaluating multi-turn interaction abilities for VLMs.

Result: 在指令跟随和场景问答任务上的评估表明，使用Cypher接口比基线方法在大型丰富图上扩展性更好，性能大幅提升，同时显著减少场景图内容的token数量。

Conclusion: Cypher作为3D场景图接口的方法在大型丰富图上具有显著更好的扩展性，能够大幅提升接地语言任务的性能。

Abstract: In order to provide a robot with the ability to understand and react to a
user's natural language inputs, the natural language must be connected to the
robot's underlying representations of the world. Recently, large language
models (LLMs) and 3D scene graphs (3DSGs) have become a popular choice for
grounding natural language and representing the world. In this work, we address
the challenge of using LLMs with 3DSGs to ground natural language. Existing
methods encode the scene graph as serialized text within the LLM's context
window, but this encoding does not scale to large or rich 3DSGs. Instead, we
propose to use a form of Retrieval Augmented Generation to select a subset of
the 3DSG relevant to the task. We encode a 3DSG in a graph database and provide
a query language interface (Cypher) as a tool to the LLM with which it can
retrieve relevant data for language grounding. We evaluate our approach on
instruction following and scene question-answering tasks and compare against
baseline context window and code generation methods. Our results show that
using Cypher as an interface to 3D scene graphs scales significantly better to
large, rich graphs on both local and cloud-based models. This leads to large
performance improvements in grounded language tasks while also substantially
reducing the token count of the scene graph content. A video supplement is

Abstract: Lychee is a high-value subtropical fruit. The adoption of vision-based
harvesting robots can significantly improve productivity while reduce reliance
on labor. High-quality data are essential for developing such harvesting
robots. However, there are currently no consistently and comprehensively
annotated open-source lychee datasets featuring fruits in natural growing

detection and maturity classification. Color (RGB) images were acquired under
diverse weather conditions, and at different times of the day, across multiple
lychee varieties, such as Nuomici, Feizixiao, Heiye, and Huaizhi. The dataset
encompasses three different ripeness stages and contains 11,414 images,
consisting of 878 raw RGB images, 8,780 augmented RGB images, and 1,756 depth
images. The images are annotated with 9,658 pairs of lables for lychee
detection and maturity classification. To improve annotation consistency, three
individuals independently labeled the data, and their results were then
aggregated and verified by a fourth reviewer. Detailed statistical analyses
were done to examine the dataset. Finally, we performed experiments using three
representative deep learning models to evaluate the dataset. It is publicly

Motivation: 揭示病理学基础模型的关键脆弱性，建立高标准的模型鲁棒性评估基准，促进防御机制的发展，确保AI在病理学中的安全可靠部署。

Method: 使用深度学习优化生成固定的微弱噪声模式(UTAP)，将其添加到病理图像中，系统性地破坏基础模型的特征表示能力，并在多个数据集和模型上进行评估。

Result: UTAP能够显著降低各种最先进病理学基础模型的性能，具有通用性(跨不同视野)和可迁移性(影响未见过的黑盒模型)，且对输入图像仅进行视觉不可察觉的修改。

Conclusion: UTAP构成了对新兴病理学基础模型及其应用的广泛威胁，强调了推进防御机制的必要性，并为对抗训练提供了必要资源，以确保AI在病理学中的安全部署。

Abstract: We introduce Universal and Transferable Adversarial Perturbations (UTAP) for
pathology foundation models that reveal critical vulnerabilities in their
capabilities. Optimized using deep learning, UTAP comprises a fixed and weak
noise pattern that, when added to a pathology image, systematically disrupts
the feature representation capabilities of multiple pathology foundation
models. Therefore, UTAP induces performance drops in downstream tasks that
utilize foundation models, including misclassification across a wide range of
unseen data distributions. In addition to compromising the model performance,
we demonstrate two key features of UTAP: (1) universality: its perturbation can
be applied across diverse field-of-views independent of the dataset that UTAP
was developed on, and (2) transferability: its perturbation can successfully
degrade the performance of various external, black-box pathology foundation
models - never seen before. These two features indicate that UTAP is not a
dedicated attack associated with a specific foundation model or image dataset,
but rather constitutes a broad threat to various emerging pathology foundation
models and their applications. We systematically evaluated UTAP across various
state-of-the-art pathology foundation models on multiple datasets, causing a
significant drop in their performance with visually imperceptible modifications
to the input images using a fixed noise pattern. The development of these
potent attacks establishes a critical, high-standard benchmark for model
robustness evaluation, highlighting a need for advancing defense mechanisms and
potentially providing the necessary assets for adversarial training to ensure
the safe and reliable deployment of AI in pathology.

Abstract: Deploying real-time spatial perception on edge devices requires efficient
multi-task models that leverage complementary task information while minimizing
computational overhead. This paper introduces Multi-Mono-Hydra (M2H), a novel
multi-task learning framework designed for semantic segmentation and depth,
edge, and surface normal estimation from a single monocular image. Unlike
conventional approaches that rely on independent single-task models or shared
encoder-decoder architectures, M2H introduces a Window-Based Cross-Task
Attention Module that enables structured feature exchange while preserving
task-specific details, improving prediction consistency across tasks. Built on
a lightweight ViT-based DINOv2 backbone, M2H is optimized for real-time
deployment and serves as the foundation for monocular spatial perception
systems supporting 3D scene graph construction in dynamic environments.
Comprehensive evaluations show that M2H outperforms state-of-the-art multi-task
models on NYUDv2, surpasses single-task depth and semantic baselines on
Hypersim, and achieves superior performance on the Cityscapes dataset, all
while maintaining computational efficiency on laptop hardware. Beyond

Abstract: Hyperspectral images (HSI) promise to support a range of new applications in
computer vision. Recent research has explored the feasibility of generalizable
Spectral Reconstruction (SR), the problem of recovering a HSI from a natural
three-channel color image in unseen scenarios.
  However, previous Multi-Scale Attention (MSA) works have only demonstrated
sufficient generalizable results for very sparse spectra, while modern HSI
sensors contain hundreds of channels.
  This paper introduces a novel approach to spectral reconstruction via our
HYbrid knowledge Distillation and spectral Reconstruction Architecture (HYDRA).
  Using a Teacher model that encapsulates latent hyperspectral image data and a
Student model that learns mappings from natural images to the Teacher's encoded
domain, alongside a novel training method, we achieve high-quality spectral
reconstruction.
  This addresses key limitations of prior SR models, providing SOTA performance
across all metrics, including an 18\% boost in accuracy, and faster inference
times than current SOTA models at various channel depths.

Abstract: Spatial reasoning, the ability to ground language in 3D understanding,
remains a persistent challenge for Vision-Language Models (VLMs). We identify
two fundamental bottlenecks: inadequate 3D understanding capabilities stemming
from 2D-centric pre-training, and reasoning failures induced by redundant 3D
information. To address these, we first construct a Minimal Sufficient Set
(MSS) of information before answering a given question: a compact selection of
3D perception results from \textit{expert models}. We introduce MSSR (Minimal
Sufficient Spatial Reasoner), a dual-agent framework that implements this
principle. A Perception Agent programmatically queries 3D scenes using a
versatile perception toolbox to extract sufficient information, including a
novel SOG (Situated Orientation Grounding) module that robustly extracts
language-grounded directions. A Reasoning Agent then iteratively refines this
information to pursue minimality, pruning redundant details and requesting
missing ones in a closed loop until the MSS is curated. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method, by explicitly pursuing both sufficiency and
minimality, significantly improves accuracy and achieves state-of-the-art
performance across two challenging benchmarks. Furthermore, our framework
produces interpretable reasoning paths, offering a promising source of
high-quality training data for future models. Source code is available at

Result: 在IEEE SPS VIP Cup真实数据集上验证，通过CNR、MSR、TP和EP等指标显示性能提升，有效提高图像清晰度

Conclusion: 该方法在无干净参考图像的情况下有效提升OCT图像质量，具有临床应用的潜力

Abstract: Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) is a widely used non-invasive imaging
technique that provides detailed three-dimensional views of the retina, which
are essential for the early and accurate diagnosis of ocular diseases.
Consequently, OCT image analysis and processing have emerged as key research
areas in biomedical imaging. However, acquiring paired datasets of clean and
real-world noisy OCT images for supervised denoising models remains a
formidable challenge due to intrinsic speckle noise and practical constraints
in clinical imaging environments. To address these issues, we propose SDPA++: A
General Framework for Self-Supervised Denoising with Patch Aggregation. Our
novel approach leverages only noisy OCT images by first generating
pseudo-ground-truth images through self-fusion and self-supervised denoising.
These refined images then serve as targets to train an ensemble of denoising
models using a patch-based strategy that effectively enhances image clarity.
Performance improvements are validated via metrics such as Contrast-to-Noise
Ratio (CNR), Mean Square Ratio (MSR), Texture Preservation (TP), and Edge
Preservation (EP) on the real-world dataset from the IEEE SPS Video and Image
Processing Cup. Notably, the VIP Cup dataset contains only real-world noisy OCT
images without clean references, highlighting our method's potential for
improving image quality and diagnostic outcomes in clinical practice.

Motivation: 在领域泛化中，直接应用对比学习会降低性能，因为缺乏领域内的类内连接性。

Result: 在五个标准DG基准测试上的实验表明，DCCL即使没有领域监督也优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: DCCL通过增强跨领域的概念连接性，有效解决了领域泛化中对比学习的性能下降问题。

Abstract: Distribution shifts between training and testing samples frequently occur in
practice and impede model generalization performance. This crucial challenge
thereby motivates studies on domain generalization (DG), which aim to predict
the label on unseen target domain data by solely using data from source
domains. It is intuitive to conceive the class-separated representations
learned in contrastive learning (CL) are able to improve DG, while the reality
is quite the opposite: users observe directly applying CL deteriorates the
performance. We analyze the phenomenon with the insights from CL theory and
discover lack of intra-class connectivity in the DG setting causes the
deficiency. We thus propose a new paradigm, domain-connecting contrastive
learning (DCCL), to enhance the conceptual connectivity across domains and
obtain generalizable representations for DG. On the data side, more aggressive
data augmentation and cross-domain positive samples are introduced to improve
intra-class connectivity. On the model side, to better embed the unseen test
domains, we propose model anchoring to exploit the intra-class connectivity in
pre-trained representations and complement the anchoring with generative
transformation loss. Extensive experiments on five standard DG benchmarks are
performed. The results verify that DCCL outperforms state-of-the-art baselines
even without domain supervision. The detailed model implementation and the code

TL;DR: HumanCM是一个基于一致性模型的一步式人体运动预测框架，相比扩散模型大幅减少了推理步骤，同时保持或超越了现有方法的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的扩散模型需要多步去噪过程，推理效率较低。本文旨在开发一种高效的单步生成方法，通过一致性模型实现快速且准确的人体运动预测。

Method: 采用基于Transformer的时空架构，结合时间嵌入来建模长距离依赖关系并保持运动连贯性。通过自一致映射学习噪声和干净运动状态之间的关系。

Result: 在Human3.6M和HumanEva-I数据集上的实验表明，HumanCM在准确性上与最先进的扩散模型相当或更优，同时将推理步骤减少了高达两个数量级。

Conclusion: HumanCM证明了通过一致性模型实现高效单步人体运动预测的可行性，为实时应用提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: We present HumanCM, a one-step human motion prediction framework built upon
consistency models. Instead of relying on multi-step denoising as in
diffusion-based methods, HumanCM performs efficient single-step generation by
learning a self-consistent mapping between noisy and clean motion states. The
framework adopts a Transformer-based spatiotemporal architecture with temporal
embeddings to model long-range dependencies and preserve motion coherence.
Experiments on Human3.6M and HumanEva-I demonstrate that HumanCM achieves
comparable or superior accuracy to state-of-the-art diffusion models while
reducing inference steps by up to two orders of magnitude.

Abstract: Existing research on 3D Large Language Models (LLMs) still struggles to
achieve grounded question-answering, primarily due to the under-exploration of
the mech- anism of human-like scene-object grounded reasoning. This paper
bridges the gap by presenting a novel framework. We first introduce a grounded
Chain-of- Thought reasoning method in 3D scenes (SCENECOT), decoupling a
complex reasoning task into simpler and manageable problems, and building
corresponding visual clues based on multimodal expert modules. To enable such a
method, we develop SCENECOT-185K, the first large-scale grounded CoT reasoning
dataset, consisting of 185K high-quality instances. Extensive experiments
across various complex 3D scene reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our new
framework achieves strong performance with high grounding-QA coherence. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first successful application of CoT
reasoning to 3D scene understanding, enabling step-by-step human-like reasoning
and showing potential for extension to broader 3D scene understanding
scenarios.

TL;DR: IR-WM是一个隐式残差世界模型，专注于建模世界的当前状态和演化，通过预测残差变化而非完整重建未来场景来提升自动驾驶系统的效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有端到端自动驾驶系统中的视觉中心世界模型在完整重建未来场景时存在效率低下问题，大量计算资源被浪费在建模静态背景上。

Method: 首先从视觉观测建立鲁棒的鸟瞰图表示，利用前一时刻的BEV特征作为时间先验，仅预测基于自车动作和场景上下文的残差变化，并应用对齐模块校准语义和动态错位。

Result: 在nuScenes基准测试中，IR-WM在4D占用预测和轨迹规划方面均达到顶级性能。

Conclusion: 隐式残差世界模型通过专注于动态变化而非完整重建，显著提升了自动驾驶系统的预测和规划精度。

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving systems increasingly rely on vision-centric
world models to understand and predict their environment. However, a common
ineffectiveness in these models is the full reconstruction of future scenes,
which expends significant capacity on redundantly modeling static backgrounds.
To address this, we propose IR-WM, an Implicit Residual World Model that
focuses on modeling the current state and evolution of the world. IR-WM first
establishes a robust bird's-eye-view representation of the current state from
the visual observation. It then leverages the BEV features from the previous
timestep as a strong temporal prior and predicts only the "residual", i.e., the
changes conditioned on the ego-vehicle's actions and scene context. To
alleviate error accumulation over time, we further apply an alignment module to
calibrate semantic and dynamic misalignments. Moreover, we investigate
different forecasting-planning coupling schemes and demonstrate that the
implicit future state generated by world models substantially improves planning
accuracy. On the nuScenes benchmark, IR-WM achieves top performance in both 4D
occupancy forecasting and trajectory planning.

TL;DR: 提出UKANFormer模型，在Allen Coral Atlas噪声监督下实现高精度珊瑚礁语义分割，挑战了数据质量直接限制模型性能的传统观念。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球珊瑚礁分布产品如Allen Coral Atlas存在空间精度和语义一致性不足的问题，特别是在需要精细边界划分的区域。

Method: 基于UKAN架构，在解码器中加入全局-局部变换器(GLT-rans)模块，同时提取全局语义结构和局部边界细节。

Result: 在噪声标签设置下，珊瑚类IoU达到67.00%，像素精度83.98%，优于传统基线，预测结果在视觉和结构上都比训练用的噪声标签更准确。

Conclusion: 架构设计可以缓解标签噪声，支持在非完美监督下进行可扩展的制图，为生态监测提供了基础。

Abstract: Coral reefs are vital yet fragile ecosystems that require accurate
large-scale mapping for effective conservation. Although global products such
as the Allen Coral Atlas provide unprecedented coverage of global coral reef
distri-bution, their predictions are frequently limited in spatial precision
and semantic consistency, especially in regions requiring fine-grained boundary
delineation. To address these challenges, we propose UKANFormer, a novel
se-mantic segmentation model designed to achieve high-precision mapping under
noisy supervision derived from Allen Coral Atlas. Building upon the UKAN
architecture, UKANFormer incorporates a Global-Local Transformer (GL-Trans)
block in the decoder, enabling the extraction of both global semantic
structures and local boundary details. In experiments, UKANFormer achieved a
coral-class IoU of 67.00% and pixel accuracy of 83.98%, outperforming
conventional baselines under the same noisy labels setting. Remarkably, the
model produces predictions that are visually and structurally more accurate
than the noisy labels used for training. These results challenge the notion
that data quality directly limits model performance, showing that architectural
design can mitigate label noise and sup-port scalable mapping under imperfect
supervision. UKANFormer provides a foundation for ecological monitoring where
reliable labels are scarce.

Abstract: Embodied AI requires agents that perceive, act, and anticipate how actions
reshape future world states. World models serve as internal simulators that
capture environment dynamics, enabling forward and counterfactual rollouts to
support perception, prediction, and decision making. This survey presents a
unified framework for world models in embodied AI. Specifically, we formalize
the problem setting and learning objectives, and propose a three-axis taxonomy
encompassing: (1) Functionality, Decision-Coupled vs. General-Purpose; (2)
Temporal Modeling, Sequential Simulation and Inference vs. Global Difference
Prediction; (3) Spatial Representation, Global Latent Vector, Token Feature
Sequence, Spatial Latent Grid, and Decomposed Rendering Representation. We
systematize data resources and metrics across robotics, autonomous driving, and
general video settings, covering pixel prediction quality, state-level
understanding, and task performance. Furthermore, we offer a quantitative
comparison of state-of-the-art models and distill key open challenges,
including the scarcity of unified datasets and the need for evaluation metrics
that assess physical consistency over pixel fidelity, the trade-off between
model performance and the computational efficiency required for real-time
control, and the core modeling difficulty of achieving long-horizon temporal
consistency while mitigating error accumulation. Finally, we maintain a curated

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究表明，对于视觉自回归模型，离散的序列特性使得搜索策略（如束搜索）在图像生成中非常有效，能够显著提升文本到图像生成的质量，让较小的模型超越更大的扩散模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管在大型语言模型中推理时搜索已经取得了革命性进展，但在图像生成领域应用搜索策略却面临困难，特别是对于连续扩散模型，简单的随机采样往往效果更好。

Method: 利用视觉自回归模型的离散、序列特性，应用束搜索策略进行图像生成，通过对离散标记空间的早期剪枝和计算重用实现高效搜索。

Result: 束搜索显著改善了文本到图像生成，使2B参数的自回归模型在多个基准测试中优于12B参数的扩散模型。系统消融实验表明优势来源于离散标记空间。

Conclusion: 模型架构（而不仅仅是规模）对于视觉生成中的推理时优化至关重要，离散自回归模型更适合应用搜索策略。

Abstract: While inference-time scaling through search has revolutionized Large Language
Models, translating these gains to image generation has proven difficult.
Recent attempts to apply search strategies to continuous diffusion models show
limited benefits, with simple random sampling often performing best. We
demonstrate that the discrete, sequential nature of visual autoregressive
models enables effective search for image generation. We show that beam search
substantially improves text-to-image generation, enabling a 2B parameter
autoregressive model to outperform a 12B parameter diffusion model across
benchmarks. Systematic ablations show that this advantage comes from the
discrete token space, which allows early pruning and computational reuse, and
our verifier analysis highlights trade-offs between speed and reasoning
capability. These findings suggest that model architecture, not just scale, is
critical for inference-time optimization in visual generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成式图像超分辨率模型能力的增强，它们倾向于产生伪影，这些伪影的感知影响各不相同，有些几乎不可见，有些则严重降低图像质量。作者认为应该根据伪影对人类观察者的显著性来表征，而不是将其视为统一的二元缺陷。

Method: 构建了一个包含1302个来自11种当代图像SR方法的伪影示例的数据集，每个伪影都配有众包显著性评分。基于此数据集训练了一个轻量级回归器，用于生成空间显著性热图。

Result: 训练的回归器在检测显著伪影方面优于现有方法，能够准确识别对人类观察者影响较大的伪影。

Conclusion: 该研究为SR伪影的显著性感知评估和缓解提供了数据集和工具，有助于更准确地评估超分辨率图像质量。

Abstract: Generative image super-resolution (SR) is rapidly advancing in visual quality
and detail restoration. As the capacity of SR models expands, however, so does
their tendency to produce artifacts: incorrect, visually disturbing details
that reduce perceived quality. Crucially, their perceptual impact varies: some
artifacts are barely noticeable while others strongly degrade the image. We
argue that artifacts should be characterized by their prominence to human
observers rather than treated as uniform binary defects. Motivated by this, we
present a novel dataset of 1302 artifact examples from 11 contemporary image-SR
methods, where each artifact is paired with a crowdsourced prominence score.
Building on this dataset, we train a lightweight regressor that produces
spatial prominence heatmaps and outperforms existing methods at detecting
prominent artifacts. We release the dataset and code to facilitate
prominence-aware evaluation and mitigation of SR artifacts.

Method: 提出WaMaIR框架：1) 全局多尺度小波变换卷积(GMWTConvs)扩大感受野；2) Mamba通道感知模块(MCAM)捕获通道间长程依赖；3) 多尺度纹理增强损失(MTELoss)指导纹理结构保留。

Result: 大量实验证实WaMaIR优于现有最先进方法，在图像恢复效果和计算效率方面都表现优异。

Conclusion: WaMaIR通过结合大感受野特征提取、通道感知建模和纹理增强损失，有效解决了图像恢复中纹理细节重建的挑战。

Abstract: Image restoration is a fundamental and challenging task in computer vision,
where CNN-based frameworks demonstrate significant computational efficiency.
However, previous CNN-based methods often face challenges in adequately
restoring fine texture details, which are limited by the small receptive field
of CNN structures and the lack of channel feature modeling. In this paper, we
propose WaMaIR, which is a novel framework with a large receptive field for
image perception and improves the reconstruction of texture details in restored
images. Specifically, we introduce the Global Multiscale Wavelet Transform
Convolutions (GMWTConvs) for expandding the receptive field to extract image
features, preserving and enriching texture features in model inputs. Meanwhile,
we propose the Mamba-Based Channel-Aware Module (MCAM), explicitly designed to
capture long-range dependencies within feature channels, which enhancing the
model sensitivity to color, edges, and texture information. Additionally, we
propose Multiscale Texture Enhancement Loss (MTELoss) for image restoration to
guide the model in preserving detailed texture structures effectively.
Extensive experiments confirm that WaMaIR outperforms state-of-the-art methods,
achieving better image restoration and efficient computational performance of
the model.

Result: 实验表明该方法能产生更连贯且与指令对齐的结果

Conclusion: 该方法通过多级语义对齐实现了精确协调的图像编辑，代码已开源

Abstract: Recent research has made significant progress in localizing and editing image
regions based on text. However, most approaches treat these regions in
isolation, relying solely on local cues without accounting for how each part
contributes to the overall visual and semantic composition. This often results
in inconsistent edits, unnatural transitions, or loss of coherence across the
image. In this work, we propose Region in Context, a novel framework for
text-conditioned image editing that performs multilevel semantic alignment
between vision and language, inspired by the human ability to reason about
edits in relation to the whole scene. Our method encourages each region to
understand its role within the global image context, enabling precise and
harmonized changes. At its core, the framework introduces a dual-level guidance
mechanism: regions are represented with full-image context and aligned with
detailed region-level descriptions, while the entire image is simultaneously
matched to a comprehensive scene-level description generated by a large
vision-language model. These descriptions serve as explicit verbal references
of the intended content, guiding both local modifications and global structure.
Experiments show that it produces more coherent and instruction-aligned
results. Code is available at:

Motivation: 现有医疗报告生成模型主要依赖大语言模型，对预训练视觉基础模型和高级微调技术探索不足，且忽略了非Transformer架构如Mamba网络的潜力。

Method: 将X射线图像分块标记化，通过SSM视觉骨干提取特征，使用Partial LoRA进行参数高效微调，结合混合解码器LLM生成医疗报告。

Result: 在三个广泛使用的基准数据集上的大量实验验证了所提策略的有效性。

Conclusion: EMRRG框架通过微调Mamba网络实现了端到端训练，在X射线医疗报告生成任务中表现出色。

Abstract: X-ray image-based medical report generation (MRG) is a pivotal area in
artificial intelligence that can significantly reduce diagnostic burdens for
clinicians and patient wait times. Existing MRG models predominantly rely on
Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve report generation, with limited
exploration of pre-trained vision foundation models or advanced fine-tuning
techniques. Mainstream frameworks either avoid fine-tuning or utilize
simplistic methods like LoRA, often neglecting the potential of enhancing
cross-attention mechanisms. Additionally, while Transformer-based models
dominate vision-language tasks, non-Transformer architectures, such as the
Mamba network, remain underexplored for medical report generation, presenting a
promising avenue for future research. In this paper, we propose EMRRG, a novel
X-ray report generation framework that fine-tunes pre-trained Mamba networks
using parameter-efficient methods. Specifically, X-ray images are divided into
patches, tokenized, and processed by an SSM-based vision backbone for feature
extraction, with Partial LoRA yielding optimal performance. An LLM with a
hybrid decoder generates the medical report, enabling end-to-end training and
achieving strong results on benchmark datasets. Extensive experiments on three
widely used benchmark datasets fully validated the effectiveness of our
proposed strategies for the X-ray MRG. The source code of this paper will be

Conclusion: GS2POSE通过可微分渲染和颜色参数更新，有效解决了纹理缺失和光照变化下的6D姿态估计问题，取得了优于现有方法的性能。

Abstract: Accurate 6D pose estimation of 3D objects is a fundamental task in computer
vision, and current research typically predicts the 6D pose by establishing
correspondences between 2D image features and 3D model features. However, these
methods often face difficulties with textureless objects and varying
illumination conditions. To overcome these limitations, we propose GS2POSE, a
novel approach for 6D object pose estimation. GS2POSE formulates a pose
regression algorithm inspired by the principles of Bundle Adjustment (BA). By
leveraging Lie algebra, we extend the capabilities of 3DGS to develop a
pose-differentiable rendering pipeline, which iteratively optimizes the pose by
comparing the input image to the rendered image. Additionally, GS2POSE updates
color parameters within the 3DGS model, enhancing its adaptability to changes
in illumination. Compared to previous models, GS2POSE demonstrates accuracy
improvements of 1.4\%, 2.8\% and 2.5\% on the T-LESS, LineMod-Occlusion and
LineMod datasets, respectively.

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一条有效、可解释且模型无关的途径，用于视频内容的零样本自动结构分析。

Abstract: The remarkable zero-shot reasoning capabilities of large-scale Visual
Language Models (VLMs) on static images have yet to be fully translated to the
video domain. Conventional video understanding models often rely on extensive,
task-specific training on annotated datasets, a process that is both costly and
limited in scalability. This paper introduces a novel, training-free framework
for video understanding that circumvents end-to-end training by synergistically
combining the rich semantic priors of pre-trained VLMs with classic machine
learning algorithms for pattern discovery. Our core idea is to reframe video
understanding as a self-supervised spatio-temporal clustering problem within a
high-dimensional semantic feature space. The proposed pipeline first transforms
a video stream into a semantic feature trajectory using the frozen visual
encoder of a pre-trained VLM. Subsequently, we employ Kernel Temporal
Segmentation (KTS), a robust machine learning technique, to partition the
continuous feature stream into discrete, semantically coherent event segments.
These segments are then subjected to unsupervised density-based clustering to
identify recurring macroscopic scenes and themes throughout the video. By
selecting representative keyframes from each discovered cluster and leveraging
the VLM's generative capabilities for textual description, our framework
automatically produces a structured, multi-modal summary of the video content.
This approach provides an effective, interpretable, and model-agnostic pathway
for zero-shot, automated structural analysis of video content.

Motivation: 当前方法需要微调模型以生成与掩码解码器兼容的输出，这会改变模型的输出空间并损害其内在泛化能力，违背了构建统一模型的目标。

Method: 在完全冻结的MLLM上附加轻量级可训练头部，通过精炼注意力图中的空间线索提取关键点，并将其描述为与掩码解码器直接兼容的点级特征。

Result: LENS实现了与基于重新训练方法相当或更优的分割性能，同时完全保留了MLLM的泛化能力，而微调方法会显著降低这种能力。

Conclusion: LENS的可附加设计为扩展MLLM建立了一个高效强大的范式，为构建真正多才多艺的统一模型铺平了道路。

Abstract: Integrating diverse visual capabilities into a unified model is a significant
trend in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Among these, the inclusion
of segmentation poses a distinct set of challenges. To equip MLLMs with
pixel-level segmentation abilities, prevailing methods require finetuning the
model to produce specific outputs compatible with a mask decoder. This process
typically alters the model's output space and compromises its intrinsic
generalization, which undermines the goal of building a unified model. We
introduce LENS (Leveraging kEypoiNts for MLLMs' Segmentation), a novel
plug-and-play solution. LENS attaches a lightweight, trainable head to a
completely frozen MLLM. By refining the spatial cues embedded in attention
maps, LENS extracts keypoints and describes them into point-wise features
directly compatible with the mask decoder. Extensive experiments validate our
approach: LENS achieves segmentation performance competitive with or superior
to that of retraining-based methods. Crucially, it does so while fully
preserving the MLLM's generalization capabilities, which are significantly
degraded by finetuning approaches. As such, the attachable design of LENS
establishes an efficient and powerful paradigm for extending MLLMs, paving the
way for truly multi-talented, unified models.

Method: 首先基于几何先验生成弱标签（地平线上方为非道路，车辆前方四边形为道路），然后通过跨帧跟踪局部特征点并利用互信息最大化来强制时间一致性。

Result: 在Cityscapes数据集上达到0.82的IoU，表现出高精度和简单设计。

Conclusion: 结合几何约束和时间一致性在自动驾驶中具有可扩展的无监督道路分割潜力。

Abstract: This paper presents a fully unsupervised approach for binary road
segmentation (road vs. non-road), eliminating the reliance on costly manually
labeled datasets. The method leverages scene geometry and temporal cues to
distinguish road from non-road regions. Weak labels are first generated from
geometric priors, marking pixels above the horizon as non-road and a predefined
quadrilateral in front of the vehicle as road. In a refinement stage, temporal
consistency is enforced by tracking local feature points across frames and
penalizing inconsistent label assignments using mutual information
maximization. This enhances both precision and temporal stability. On the
Cityscapes dataset, the model achieves an Intersection-over-Union (IoU) of
0.82, demonstrating high accuracy with a simple design. These findings
demonstrate the potential of combining geometric constraints and temporal
consistency for scalable unsupervised road segmentation in autonomous driving.

Method: 基于预训练文本到图像扩散模型，使用文本反转技术优化摄影概念的提示词，学习参考图像的摄影风格。

Result: PIF在提取和迁移各种摄影风格方面表现出色。

Conclusion: PIF能够有效学习摄影风格概念并成功迁移到内容图像，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Photographic style, as a composition of certain photographic concepts, is the
charm behind renowned photographers. But learning and transferring photographic
style need a profound understanding of how the photo is edited from the unknown
original appearance. Previous works either fail to learn meaningful
photographic concepts from reference images, or cannot preserve the content of
the content image. To tackle these issues, we proposed a Personalized Image
Filter (PIF). Based on a pretrained text-to-image diffusion model, the
generative prior enables PIF to learn the average appearance of photographic
concepts, as well as how to adjust them according to text prompts. PIF then
learns the photographic style of reference images with the textual inversion
technique, by optimizing the prompts for the photographic concepts. PIF shows
outstanding performance in extracting and transferring various kinds of
photographic style. Project page: https://pif.pages.dev/

TL;DR: ReefNet是一个大规模公开珊瑚礁图像数据集，包含约92.5万条专家验证的属级硬珊瑚标注，映射到世界海洋物种名录，旨在推动自动化珊瑚礁监测和领域泛化研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于气候变化等人为压力导致珊瑚礁快速衰退，迫切需要可扩展的自动化监测方法。现有数据集在规模、地理覆盖范围和标签粒度方面存在局限，无法满足机器学习需求。

Method: 整合了76个CoralNet来源和红海Al Wajh站点的图像数据，提供细粒度、分类学映射的标签。提出两种评估设置：源内基准测试和跨源基准测试，分别测试局部性能和领域泛化能力。

Result: 监督学习在源内表现良好，但跨域性能显著下降；零样本模型在所有情况下表现均较差，特别是对于稀有和视觉相似属类。

Conclusion: ReefNet为领域泛化和细粒度珊瑚分类提供了一个具有挑战性的基准，旨在推动稳健、领域自适应的全球珊瑚礁监测和保护技术的发展。

Abstract: Coral reefs are rapidly declining due to anthropogenic pressures such as
climate change, underscoring the urgent need for scalable, automated
monitoring. We introduce ReefNet, a large public coral reef image dataset with
point-label annotations mapped to the World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS).
ReefNet aggregates imagery from 76 curated CoralNet sources and an additional
site from Al Wajh in the Red Sea, totaling approximately 925000 genus-level
hard coral annotations with expert-verified labels. Unlike prior datasets,
which are often limited by size, geography, or coarse labels and are not
ML-ready, ReefNet offers fine-grained, taxonomically mapped labels at a global
scale to WoRMS. We propose two evaluation settings: (i) a within-source
benchmark that partitions each source's images for localized evaluation, and
(ii) a cross-source benchmark that withholds entire sources to test domain
generalization. We analyze both supervised and zero-shot classification
performance on ReefNet and find that while supervised within-source performance
is promising, supervised performance drops sharply across domains, and
performance is low across the board for zero-shot models, especially for rare
and visually similar genera. This provides a challenging benchmark intended to
catalyze advances in domain generalization and fine-grained coral
classification. We will release our dataset, benchmarking code, and pretrained
models to advance robust, domain-adaptive, global coral reef monitoring and
conservation.

TL;DR: 提出AdaptMoist域适应方法，利用纹理特征预测木屑水分含量，解决不同来源木屑数据分布变化问题，准确率提升23%达到80%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有直接方法（烘箱干燥）处理时间长且破坏样本，间接方法在木屑来源多样时准确性不足。需要一种能有效缓解来源变异影响的稳健方法。

Method: 综合分析五种纹理特征预测水分含量，提出AdaptMoist域适应方法利用纹理特征在不同域间转移知识，并基于调整互信息提出模型保存标准。

Result: 组合五种纹理特征达到95%准确率，AdaptMoist方法使跨域预测准确率从57%提升至80%，提高23%。

Conclusion: AdaptMoist是跨域木屑水分含量估计的有效稳健解决方案，对依赖木屑的产业具有应用潜力。

Abstract: Accurate and quick prediction of wood chip moisture content is critical for
optimizing biofuel production and ensuring energy efficiency. The current
widely used direct method (oven drying) is limited by its longer processing
time and sample destructiveness. On the other hand, existing indirect methods,
including near-infrared spectroscopy-based, electrical capacitance-based, and
image-based approaches, are quick but not accurate when wood chips come from
various sources. Variability in the source material can alter data
distributions, undermining the performance of data-driven models. Therefore,
there is a need for a robust approach that effectively mitigates the impact of
source variability. Previous studies show that manually extracted texture
features have the potential to predict wood chip moisture class. Building on
this, in this study, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of five distinct
texture feature types extracted from wood chip images to predict moisture
content. Our findings reveal that a combined feature set incorporating all five
texture features achieves an accuracy of 95% and consistently outperforms
individual texture features in predicting moisture content. To ensure robust
moisture prediction, we propose a domain adaptation method named AdaptMoist
that utilizes the texture features to transfer knowledge from one source of
wood chip data to another, addressing variability across different domains. We
also proposed a criterion for model saving based on adjusted mutual
information. The AdaptMoist method improves prediction accuracy across domains
by 23%, achieving an average accuracy of 80%, compared to 57% for non-adapted
models. These results highlight the effectiveness of AdaptMoist as a robust
solution for wood chip moisture content estimation across domains, making it a
potential solution for wood chip-reliant industries.

TL;DR: 提出M2HVideo框架，将假人视频转换为身份可控、逼真的人类视频，解决了头部与身体运动不对齐和身份漂移问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 假人服装展示成本低但缺乏真实感和表现细节，需要将假人视频转换为逼真的人类视频。

Method: 使用动态姿态感知头部编码器融合面部语义和身体姿态，引入镜像损失和分布感知适配器增强时间一致性。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，M2HVideo在服装一致性、身份保持和视频保真度方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: M2HVideo框架有效解决了假人到人类视频生成的关键挑战，实现了高质量的身份可控视频生成。

Abstract: Mannequin-based clothing displays offer a cost-effective alternative to
real-model showcases for online fashion presentation, but lack realism and
expressive detail. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a new task called
mannequin-to-human (M2H) video generation, which aims to synthesize
identity-controllable, photorealistic human videos from footage of mannequins.
We propose M2HVideo, a pose-aware and identity-preserving video generation
framework that addresses two key challenges: the misalignment between head and
body motion, and identity drift caused by temporal modeling. In particular,
M2HVideo incorporates a dynamic pose-aware head encoder that fuses facial
semantics with body pose to produce consistent identity embeddings across
frames. To address the loss of fine facial details due to latent space
compression, we introduce a mirror loss applied in pixel space through a
denoising diffusion implicit model (DDIM)-based one-step denoising.
Additionally, we design a distribution-aware adapter that aligns statistical
distributions of identity and clothing features to enhance temporal coherence.
Extensive experiments on the UBC fashion dataset, our self-constructed ASOS
dataset, and the newly collected MannequinVideos dataset captured on-site
demonstrate that M2HVideo achieves superior performance in terms of clothing
consistency, identity preservation, and video fidelity in comparison to
state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: 2DGS-R是一种改进的2D高斯泼溅方法，通过分层训练策略在保持几何精度的同时提升渲染质量，仅增加1%存储和少量训练时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯泼溅(3DGS)渲染质量高但难以准确表示表面，2DGS几何保真度好但渲染质量不足，需要同时实现高质量渲染和精确几何结构。

Method: 采用分层训练：首先用法向一致性正则化训练原始2D高斯；然后选择渲染质量不足的2D高斯进行原地克隆操作；最后冻结不透明度进行微调。

Result: 相比原始2DGS，仅增加1%存储和少量训练时间，实现了高质量渲染结果同时保持精细几何结构。

Conclusion: 该方法有效平衡了效率与性能，在视觉保真度和几何重建精度方面均有提升。

Abstract: Recent advancements in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have greatly influenced
neural fields, as it enables high-fidelity rendering with impressive visual
quality. However, 3DGS has difficulty accurately representing surfaces. In
contrast, 2DGS transforms the 3D volume into a collection of 2D planar Gaussian
disks. Despite advancements in geometric fidelity, rendering quality remains
compromised, highlighting the challenge of achieving both high-quality
rendering and precise geometric structures. This indicates that optimizing both
geometric and rendering quality in a single training stage is currently
unfeasible. To overcome this limitation, we present 2DGS-R, a new method that
uses a hierarchical training approach to improve rendering quality while
maintaining geometric accuracy. 2DGS-R first trains the original 2D Gaussians
with the normal consistency regularization. Then 2DGS-R selects the 2D
Gaussians with inadequate rendering quality and applies a novel in-place
cloning operation to enhance the 2D Gaussians. Finally, we fine-tune the 2DGS-R
model with opacity frozen. Experimental results show that compared to the
original 2DGS, our method requires only 1\% more storage and minimal additional
training time. Despite this negligible overhead, it achieves high-quality
rendering results while preserving fine geometric structures. These findings
indicate that our approach effectively balances efficiency with performance,
leading to improvements in both visual fidelity and geometric reconstruction
accuracy.

Conclusion: ArmFormer是部署在便携安全摄像头、监控无人机和嵌入式AI加速器上的最优解决方案，在分布式安全基础设施中具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: The escalating threat of weapon-related violence necessitates automated
detection systems capable of pixel-level precision for accurate threat
assessment in real-time security applications. Traditional weapon detection
approaches rely on object detection frameworks that provide only coarse
bounding box localizations, lacking the fine-grained segmentation required for
comprehensive threat analysis. Furthermore, existing semantic segmentation
models either sacrifice accuracy for computational efficiency or require
excessive computational resources incompatible with edge deployment scenarios.
This paper presents ArmFormer, a lightweight transformer-based semantic
segmentation framework that strategically integrates Convolutional Block
Attention Module (CBAM) with MixVisionTransformer architecture to achieve
superior accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency suitable for
resource-constrained edge devices. Our approach combines CBAM-enhanced encoder
backbone with attention-integrated hamburger decoder to enable multi-class
weapon segmentation across five categories: handgun, rifle, knife, revolver,
and human. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that ArmFormer achieves
state-of-the-art performance with 80.64% mIoU and 89.13% mFscore while
maintaining real-time inference at 82.26 FPS. With only 4.886G FLOPs and 3.66M
parameters, ArmFormer outperforms heavyweight models requiring up to 48x more
computation, establishing it as the optimal solution for deployment on portable
security cameras, surveillance drones, and embedded AI accelerators in

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有半监督医学图像分割方法主要依赖标签空间一致性，忽略了表示空间对齐的重要性，导致模型难以学习到既具有判别性又空间一致的表示。

Method: BARL框架包含两个协作分支，在标签空间采用双路径正则化和渐进认知偏差校正实现跨分支一致性，在表示空间进行区域级和病灶实例级匹配以捕捉复杂病理模式。

Result: 在四个公开基准和私有CBCT数据集上的实验表明，BARL持续超越最先进的半监督医学图像分割方法，消融研究验证了各组件贡献。

Conclusion: BARL通过双边对齐策略有效提升了半监督医学图像分割性能，证明了表示空间和标签空间协同对齐的重要性。

Abstract: Semi-supervised medical image segmentation (SSMIS) seeks to match fully
supervised performance while sharply reducing annotation cost. Mainstream SSMIS
methods rely on \emph{label-space consistency}, yet they overlook the equally
critical \emph{representation-space alignment}. Without harmonizing latent
features, models struggle to learn representations that are both discriminative
and spatially coherent. To this end, we introduce \textbf{Bilateral Alignment
in Representation and Label spaces (BARL)}, a unified framework that couples
two collaborative branches and enforces alignment in both spaces. For
label-space alignment, inspired by co-training and multi-scale decoding, we
devise \textbf{Dual-Path Regularization (DPR)} and \textbf{Progressively
Cognitive Bias Correction (PCBC)} to impose fine-grained cross-branch
consistency while mitigating error accumulation from coarse to fine scales. For
representation-space alignment, we conduct region-level and lesion-instance
matching between branches, explicitly capturing the fragmented, complex
pathological patterns common in medical imagery. Extensive experiments on four
public benchmarks and a proprietary CBCT dataset demonstrate that BARL
consistently surpasses state-of-the-art SSMIS methods. Ablative studies further
validate the contribution of each component. Code will be released soon.

Motivation: 当前基于内存库的3D异常检测方法存在特征变换不一致和判别能力有限的问题，特别是在捕捉局部几何细节和实现旋转不变性方面。当配准失败时，这些限制会导致不可靠的检测结果。

Method: 提出配准诱导的旋转不变特征提取框架，将点云配准目标与基于内存的异常检测集成。通过将特征提取嵌入到配准学习过程中，联合优化对齐和表示学习。

Result: 在Anomaly-ShapeNet和Real3D-AD数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法在有效性和泛化性方面始终优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 点云配准不仅在几何结构对齐中起关键作用，还能指导特征提取获得旋转不变和局部判别性表示，通过联合优化配准和异常检测任务可以显著提升3D异常检测性能。

Abstract: 3D anomaly detection in point-cloud data is critical for industrial quality
control, aiming to identify structural defects with high reliability. However,
current memory bank-based methods often suffer from inconsistent feature
transformations and limited discriminative capacity, particularly in capturing
local geometric details and achieving rotation invariance. These limitations
become more pronounced when registration fails, leading to unreliable detection
results. We argue that point-cloud registration plays an essential role not
only in aligning geometric structures but also in guiding feature extraction
toward rotation-invariant and locally discriminative representations. To this
end, we propose a registration-induced, rotation-invariant feature extraction
framework that integrates the objectives of point-cloud registration and
memory-based anomaly detection. Our key insight is that both tasks rely on
modeling local geometric structures and leveraging feature similarity across
samples. By embedding feature extraction into the registration learning
process, our framework jointly optimizes alignment and representation learning.
This integration enables the network to acquire features that are both robust
to rotations and highly effective for anomaly detection. Extensive experiments
on the Anomaly-ShapeNet and Real3D-AD datasets demonstrate that our method
consistently outperforms existing approaches in effectiveness and
generalizability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对人工神经网络与人类大脑处理之间相似性的理解有限：单模态ANN研究无法捕捉大脑固有的多模态处理能力，而多模态ANN研究主要关注高层模型输出，忽略了单个神经元的关键作用。

Method: 结合细粒度人工神经元分析与基于fMRI的体素编码，研究了两种架构不同的视觉语言模型（CLIP和METER），通过神经元级别的分析框架来研究多模态信息处理机制。

Result: 发现四种关键结果：人工神经元能成功预测跨多个功能网络的生物神经元活动；两者都表现出功能冗余；人工神经元表现出与生物神经元平行的极性模式；不同架构驱动不同的生物神经元激活模式。

Conclusion: 这些结果为视觉语言模型中存在神经元级别的大脑类似层次处理提供了有力证据，揭示了人工神经网络与生物神经系统之间的深层相似性。

Abstract: While brain-inspired artificial intelligence(AI) has demonstrated promising
results, current understanding of the parallels between artificial neural
networks (ANNs) and human brain processing remains limited: (1) unimodal ANN
studies fail to capture the brain's inherent multimodal processing
capabilities, and (2) multimodal ANN research primarily focuses on high-level
model outputs, neglecting the crucial role of individual neurons. To address
these limitations, we propose a novel neuron-level analysis framework that
investigates the multimodal information processing mechanisms in
vision-language models (VLMs) through the lens of human brain activity. Our
approach uniquely combines fine-grained artificial neuron (AN) analysis with
fMRI-based voxel encoding to examine two architecturally distinct VLMs: CLIP
and METER. Our analysis reveals four key findings: (1) ANs successfully predict
biological neurons (BNs) activities across multiple functional networks
(including language, vision, attention, and default mode), demonstrating shared
representational mechanisms; (2) Both ANs and BNs demonstrate functional
redundancy through overlapping neural representations, mirroring the brain's
fault-tolerant and collaborative information processing mechanisms; (3) ANs
exhibit polarity patterns that parallel the BNs, with oppositely activated BNs
showing mirrored activation trends across VLM layers, reflecting the complexity
and bidirectional nature of neural information processing; (4) The
architectures of CLIP and METER drive distinct BNs: CLIP's independent branches
show modality-specific specialization, whereas METER's cross-modal design
yields unified cross-modal activation, highlighting the architecture's
influence on ANN brain-like properties. These results provide compelling
evidence for brain-like hierarchical processing in VLMs at the neuronal level.

Abstract: Generative models, especially Diffusion Models, have demonstrated remarkable
capability in generating high-quality synthetic data, including medical images.
However, traditional class-conditioned generative models often struggle to
generate images that accurately represent specific medical categories, limiting
their usefulness for applications such as skin cancer diagnosis. To address
this problem, we propose a classification-induced diffusion model, namely,
Class-N-Diff, to simultaneously generate and classify dermoscopic images. Our
Class-N-Diff model integrates a classifier within a diffusion model to guide
image generation based on its class conditions. Thus, the model has better
control over class-conditioned image synthesis, resulting in more realistic and
diverse images. Additionally, the classifier demonstrates improved performance,
highlighting its effectiveness for downstream diagnostic tasks. This unique
integration in our Class-N-Diff makes it a robust tool for enhancing the
quality and utility of diffusion model-based synthetic dermoscopic image
generation. Our code is available at https://github.com/Munia03/Class-N-Diff.

Conclusion: Edit-R1是一个模型无关的框架，具有广泛适用性，能显著提升指令图像编辑模型的性能。

Abstract: Instruction-based image editing has achieved remarkable progress; however,
models solely trained via supervised fine-tuning often overfit to annotated
patterns, hindering their ability to explore and generalize beyond training
distributions. To this end, we introduce Edit-R1, a novel post-training
framework for instruction-based image editing based on policy optimization.
Specifically, we utilize Diffusion Negative-aware Finetuning (DiffusionNFT), a
likelihood-free policy optimization method consistent with the flow matching
forward process, thereby enabling the use of higher-order samplers and more
efficient training. Another key challenge here is the absence of a universal
reward model, resulting from the diverse nature of editing instructions and
tasks. To bridge this gap, we employ a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)
as a unified, training-free reward model, leveraging its output logits to
provide fine-grained feedback. Furthermore, we carefully design a low-variance
group filtering mechanism to reduce MLLM scoring noise and stabilize
optimization. UniWorld-V2, trained with this framework, achieves
\textbf{state-of-the-art} results on the ImgEdit and GEdit-Bench benchmarks,
scoring 4.49 and 7.83, respectively. Crucially, our framework is
model-agnostic, delivering substantial performance gains when applied to
diverse base models like Qwen-Image-Edit and FLUX-Kontext, demonstrating its
wide applicability. Code and models are publicly available at

Abstract: Aviation's non-CO2 effects, particularly contrails, are a significant
contributor to its climate impact. Persistent contrails can evolve into
cirrus-like clouds that trap outgoing infrared radiation, with radiative
forcing potentially comparable to or exceeding that of aviation's CO2
emissions. While physical models simulate contrail formation, evolution and
dissipation, validating and calibrating these models requires linking observed
contrails to the flights that generated them, a process known as
contrail-to-flight attribution. Satellite-based attribution is challenging due
to limited spatial and temporal resolution, as contrails often drift and deform
before detection. In this paper, we evaluate an alternative approach using
ground-based cameras, which capture contrails shortly after formation at high
spatial and temporal resolution, when they remain thin, linear, and visually
distinct. Leveraging the ground visible camera contrail sequences (GVCCS)
dataset, we introduce a modular framework for attributing contrails observed
using ground-based cameras to theoretical contrails derived from aircraft
surveillance and meteorological data. The framework accommodates multiple
geometric representations and distance metrics, incorporates temporal
smoothing, and enables flexible probability-based assignment strategies. This
work establishes a strong baseline and provides a modular framework for future
research in linking contrails to their source flight.

Abstract: Thermal weapon segmentation is crucial for surveillance and security
applications, enabling robust detection under lowlight and visually obscured
conditions where RGB-based systems fail. While convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) dominate thermal segmentation literature, their ability to capture
long-range dependencies and fine structural details is limited. Vision
Transformers (ViTs), with their global context modeling capabilities, have
achieved state-of-the-art results in RGB segmentation tasks, yet their
potential in thermal weapon segmentation remains underexplored. This work
adapts and evaluates four transformer-based architectures SegFormer,
DeepLabV3\+, SegNeXt, and Swin Transformer for binary weapon segmentation on a
custom thermal dataset comprising 9,711 images collected from real world
surveillance videos and automatically annotated using SAM2. We employ standard
augmentation strategies within the MMSegmentation framework to ensure robust
model training and fair architectural comparison. Experimental results
demonstrate significant improvements in segmentation performance: SegFormer-b5
achieves the highest mIoU (94.15\%) and Pixel Accuracy (97.04\%), while

TL;DR: 提出了Res-Bench基准，用于评估多模态大语言模型在不同输入分辨率下的性能稳定性，包含14,400个样本和12个分辨率级别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评估方法主要关注语义性能，忽略了分辨率鲁棒性——即模型在不同输入分辨率下性能是否保持稳定。

Method: 设计了包含Spearman相关性和绝对/相对连续误差(ACE/RCE)的鲁棒性评估框架，对领先的MLLMs进行了大规模评估。

Result: 评估了模型中心和任务中心的鲁棒性，研究了填充和超分辨率等预处理策略，探索了微调对稳定性的增强效果。

Conclusion: Res-Bench填补了MLLM分辨率鲁棒性评估的空白，为模型开发提供了重要的性能稳定性基准。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) increasingly support dynamic image
resolutions. However, current evaluation paradigms primarily assess semantic
performance, overlooking the critical question of resolution robustness -
whether performance remains stable across varying input resolutions. To address
this gap, we introduce \textbf{Res-Bench}, a comprehensive benchmark comprising
14,400 samples across 12 resolution levels and six core capability dimensions.
We designed a novel evaluation framework that goes beyond traditional accuracy
metrics to capture performance stability. This framework introduces multiple
robustness metrics: Spearman's correlation for assessing resolution-performance
trends, and Absolute/Relative Continuous Error (ACE/RCE) for measuring
performance volatility. Using these metrics, we conducted a large-scale
evaluation of leading MLLMs. Our analysis encompasses: (1) model-centric and
task-centric robustness examination, (2) investigation of preprocessing
strategies including padding and super-resolution, and (3) exploration of
fine-tuning for stability enhancement.

Abstract: Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly foundation
models (FMs), have revolutionized medical image analysis, demonstrating strong
zero- and few-shot performance across diverse medical imaging tasks, from
segmentation to report generation. Unlike traditional task-specific AI models,
FMs leverage large corpora of labeled and unlabeled multimodal datasets to
learn generalized representations that can be adapted to various downstream
clinical applications with minimal fine-tuning. However, despite the rapid
proliferation of FM research in medical imaging, the field remains fragmented,
lacking a unified synthesis that systematically maps the evolution of
architectures, training paradigms, and clinical applications across modalities.
To address this gap, this review article provides a comprehensive and
structured analysis of FMs in medical image analysis. We systematically
categorize studies into vision-only and vision-language FMs based on their
architectural foundations, training strategies, and downstream clinical tasks.
Additionally, a quantitative meta-analysis of the studies was conducted to
characterize temporal trends in dataset utilization and application domains. We
also critically discuss persistent challenges, including domain adaptation,
efficient fine-tuning, computational constraints, and interpretability along
with emerging solutions such as federated learning, knowledge distillation, and
advanced prompting. Finally, we identify key future research directions aimed
at enhancing the robustness, explainability, and clinical integration of FMs,
thereby accelerating their translation into real-world medical practice.

Motivation: 扩散和流模型生成质量高但计算昂贵，现有蒸馏方法缺乏统一的理论基础。

Method: 将扩散蒸馏表述为Bregman散度密度比匹配问题，提供凸分析视角统一现有目标。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和文本到图像生成上，Di-Bregman相比反向KL蒸馏获得更好的一步FID，并保持高视觉保真度。

Conclusion: Bregman密度比匹配是实现高效一步扩散生成的实用且理论基础扎实的途径。

Abstract: Diffusion and flow models achieve high generative quality but remain
computationally expensive due to slow multi-step sampling. Distillation methods
accelerate them by training fast student generators, yet most existing
objectives lack a unified theoretical foundation. In this work, we propose
Di-Bregman, a compact framework that formulates diffusion distillation as
Bregman divergence-based density-ratio matching. This convex-analytic view
connects several existing objectives through a common lens. Experiments on
CIFAR-10 and text-to-image generation demonstrate that Di-Bregman achieves
improved one-step FID over reverse-KL distillation and maintains high visual
fidelity compared to the teacher model. Our results highlight Bregman
density-ratio matching as a practical and theoretically-grounded route toward
efficient one-step diffusion generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ADL识别方法存在表示层面的限制：序列方法保留时间顺序但对噪声敏感且缺乏空间感知，图像方法捕获全局模式但压缩时间动态并扭曲传感器布局，简单融合方法无法有效对齐不同表示视图

Method: CARE框架结合时间感知的噪声弹性序列编码和空间感知的频率敏感图像表示，使用序列-图像对比对齐(SICA)和交叉熵分类的联合目标进行端到端学习

Result: 在三个CASAS数据集上达到最先进性能：Milan 89.8%、Cairo 88.9%、Kyoto7 73.3%，并展示了对传感器故障和布局变化的鲁棒性

Conclusion: CARE框架能够学习对齐且具有区分性的嵌入，在智能家居中实现可靠的ADL识别

Abstract: The recognition of Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) from event-triggered
ambient sensors is an essential task in Ambient Assisted Living, yet existing
methods remain constrained by representation-level limitations. Sequence-based
approaches preserve temporal order of sensor activations but are sensitive to
noise and lack spatial awareness, while image-based approaches capture global
patterns and implicit spatial correlations but compress fine-grained temporal
dynamics and distort sensor layouts. Naive fusion (e.g., feature concatenation)
fail to enforce alignment between sequence- and image-based representation
views, underutilizing their complementary strengths. We propose Contrastive
Alignment for ADL Recognition from Event-Triggered Sensor Streams (CARE), an
end-to-end framework that jointly optimizes representation learning via
Sequence-Image Contrastive Alignment (SICA) and classification via
cross-entropy, ensuring both cross-representation alignment and task-specific
discriminability. CARE integrates (i) time-aware, noise-resilient sequence
encoding with (ii) spatially-informed and frequency-sensitive image
representations, and employs (iii) a joint contrastive-classification objective
for end-to-end learning of aligned and discriminative embeddings. Evaluated on
three CASAS datasets, CARE achieves state-of-the-art performance (89.8% on
Milan, 88.9% on Cairo, and 73.3% on Kyoto7) and demonstrates robustness to
sensor malfunctions and layout variability, highlighting its potential for
reliable ADL recognition in smart homes.

Result: BaGLM在三个数据集上表现出色，超越了基于训练的最先进离线方法。

Conclusion: 证明了利用大型多模态模型的零样本能力可以实现无需训练的在线视频步骤定位，且性能优于传统方法。

Abstract: Given a task and a set of steps composing it, Video Step Grounding (VSG) aims
to detect which steps are performed in a video. Standard approaches for this
task require a labeled training set (e.g., with step-level annotations or
narrations), which may be costly to collect. Moreover, they process the full
video offline, limiting their applications for scenarios requiring online
decisions. Thus, in this work, we explore how to perform VSG online and without
training. We achieve this by exploiting the zero-shot capabilities of recent
Large Multimodal Models (LMMs). In particular, we use LMMs to predict the step
associated with a restricted set of frames, without access to the whole video.
We show that this online strategy without task-specific tuning outperforms
offline and training-based models. Motivated by this finding, we develop
Bayesian Grounding with Large Multimodal Models (BaGLM), further injecting
knowledge of past frames into the LMM-based predictions. BaGLM exploits
Bayesian filtering principles, modeling step transitions via (i) a dependency
matrix extracted through large language models and (ii) an estimation of step
progress. Experiments on three datasets show superior performance of BaGLM over
state-of-the-art training-based offline methods.

Abstract: Temporal video grounding is a fundamental task in computer vision, aiming to
localize a natural language query in a long, untrimmed video. It has a key role
in the scientific community, in part due to the large amount of video generated
every day. Although we find extensive work in this task, we note that research
remains focused on a small selection of video representations, which may lead
to architectural overfitting in the long run. To address this issue, we propose
an empirical study to investigate the impact of different video features on a
classical architecture. We extract features for three well-known benchmarks,
Charades-STA, ActivityNet-Captions and YouCookII, using video encoders based on
CNNs, temporal reasoning and transformers. Our results show significant
differences in the performance of our model by simply changing the video
encoder, while also revealing clear patterns and errors derived from the use of
certain features, ultimately indicating potential feature complementarity.

Abstract: Foundation models have advanced machine learning across various modalities,
including images. Recently multiple teams trained foundation models specialized
for remote sensing applications. This line of research is motivated by the
distinct characteristics of remote sensing imagery, specific applications and
types of robustness useful for satellite image analysis. In this work we
systematically challenge the idea that specific foundation models are more
useful than general-purpose vision foundation models, at least in the small
scale. First, we design a simple benchmark that measures generalization of
remote sensing models towards images with lower resolution for two downstream
tasks. Second, we train iBOT, a self-supervised vision encoder, on MillionAID,
an ImageNet-scale satellite imagery dataset, with several modifications
specific to remote sensing. We show that none of those pretrained models bring
consistent improvements upon general-purpose baselines at the ViT-B scale.

Abstract: We introduce ED-VTG, a method for fine-grained video temporal grounding
utilizing multi-modal large language models. Our approach harnesses the
capabilities of multimodal LLMs to jointly process text and video, in order to
effectively localize natural language queries in videos through a two-stage
process. Rather than being directly grounded, language queries are initially
transformed into enriched sentences that incorporate missing details and cues
to aid in grounding. In the second stage, these enriched queries are grounded,
using a lightweight decoder, which specializes at predicting accurate
boundaries conditioned on contextualized representations of the enriched
queries. To mitigate noise and reduce the impact of hallucinations, our model
is trained with a multiple-instance-learning objective that dynamically selects
the optimal version of the query for each training sample. We demonstrate
state-of-the-art results across various benchmarks in temporal video grounding
and paragraph grounding settings. Experiments reveal that our method
significantly outperforms all previously proposed LLM-based temporal grounding
approaches and is either superior or comparable to specialized models, while
maintaining a clear advantage against them in zero-shot evaluation scenarios.

TL;DR: 提出W2R2训练框架，通过解耦表示学习和针对性捷径抑制来解决多模态3D定位中的2D语义偏差问题，在不改变推理架构的情况下实现精确的3D定位。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态3D定位模型存在严重的"2D语义偏差"，过度依赖2D图像特征进行粗略定位，而忽视3D几何输入，导致融合性能不佳。

Method: W2R2框架将2D特征指定为语义信标（What识别），3D特征作为空间锚点（Where定位），采用双目标损失函数：对齐损失通过适应交叉熵监督融合预测，伪标签损失通过基于边界的机制惩罚过度有效的2D主导伪输出。

Result: 在ScanRefer和ScanQA数据集上的实验表明，W2R2在定位准确性和鲁棒性方面取得了显著提升，特别是在杂乱户外场景中。

Conclusion: W2R2通过解耦表示学习和针对性捷径抑制有效解决了2D语义偏差问题，提升了多模态3D定位的性能。

Abstract: Multimodal 3D grounding has garnered considerable interest in Vision-Language
Models (VLMs) \cite{yin2025spatial} for advancing spatial reasoning in complex
environments. However, these models suffer from a severe "2D semantic bias"
that arises from over-reliance on 2D image features for coarse localization,
largely disregarding 3D geometric inputs and resulting in suboptimal fusion
performance. In this paper, we propose a novel training framework called
What-Where Representation Re-Forming (W2R2) to tackle this issue via
disentangled representation learning and targeted shortcut suppression. Our
approach fundamentally reshapes the model's internal space by designating 2D
features as semantic beacons for "What" identification and 3D features as
spatial anchors for "Where" localization, enabling precise 3D grounding without
modifying inference architecture. Key components include a dual-objective loss
function with an Alignment Loss that supervises fused predictions using adapted
cross-entropy for multimodal synergy, and a Pseudo-Label Loss that penalizes
overly effective 2D-dominant pseudo-outputs via a margin-based mechanism.
Experiments conducted on ScanRefer and ScanQA demonstrate the effectiveness of
W2R2, with significant gains in localization accuracy and robustness,
particularly in cluttered outdoor scenes.

Abstract: Large fingerprint datasets, while important for training and evaluation, are
time-consuming and expensive to collect and require strict privacy measures.
Researchers are exploring the use of synthetic fingerprint data to address
these issues. This paper presents a novel approach for generating synthetic
fingerprint images (both spoof and live), addressing concerns related to
privacy, cost, and accessibility in biometric data collection. Our approach
utilizes conditional StyleGAN2-ADA and StyleGAN3 architectures to produce
high-resolution synthetic live fingerprints, conditioned on specific finger
identities (thumb through little finger). Additionally, we employ CycleGANs to
translate these into realistic spoof fingerprints, simulating a variety of
presentation attack materials (e.g., EcoFlex, Play-Doh). These synthetic spoof
fingerprints are crucial for developing robust spoof detection systems. Through
these generative models, we created two synthetic datasets (DB2 and DB3), each
containing 1,500 fingerprint images of all ten fingers with multiple
impressions per finger, and including corresponding spoofs in eight material
types. The results indicate robust performance: our StyleGAN3 model achieves a
Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) as low as 5, and the generated fingerprints
achieve a True Accept Rate of 99.47% at a 0.01% False Accept Rate. The
StyleGAN2-ADA model achieved a TAR of 98.67% at the same 0.01% FAR. We assess
fingerprint quality using standard metrics (NFIQ2, MINDTCT), and notably,
matching experiments confirm strong privacy preservation, with no significant
evidence of identity leakage, confirming the strong privacy-preserving
properties of our synthetic datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 肺癌是癌症死亡的主要原因，CT成像在筛查、预后和治疗中至关重要。手动分割存在变异性且耗时，而深度学习虽然提供自动化但面临临床采用障碍。本研究旨在开发一个临床医生参与的深度学习管道，以提高可重复性、预后准确性和临床信任度。

Method: 使用来自12个公共数据集的999名患者的多中心CT数据，采用五种深度学习模型（3D Attention U-Net、ResUNet、VNet、ReconNet、SAM-Med3D），在完整图像和点击裁剪图像上与专家轮廓进行基准测试。通过497个PySERA提取的放射组学特征评估分割可重复性，比较监督学习和半监督学习在38种降维策略和24种分类器下的预后建模性能。六名医生在七个领域对掩模进行定性评估。

Result: VNet实现了最佳性能（Dice = 0.83，IoU = 0.71）、放射组学稳定性（平均相关性 = 0.76，ICC = 0.65）和半监督学习下的预测准确性（准确率 = 0.88，F1 = 0.83）。半监督学习在所有模型中始终优于监督学习。放射科医生更青睐VNet的瘤周表示和平滑边界，倾向于使用AI生成的初始掩模进行精修而非完全替换。

Conclusion: 将VNet与半监督学习相结合能够产生准确、可重复且临床可信的基于CT的肺癌预后预测，为以医生为中心的AI转化提供了一条可行路径。

Abstract: Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer mortality, with CT imaging
central to screening, prognosis, and treatment. Manual segmentation is variable
and time-intensive, while deep learning (DL) offers automation but faces
barriers to clinical adoption. Guided by the Knowledge-to-Action framework,
this study develops a clinician-in-the-loop DL pipeline to enhance
reproducibility, prognostic accuracy, and clinical trust. Multi-center CT data
from 999 patients across 12 public datasets were analyzed using five DL models
(3D Attention U-Net, ResUNet, VNet, ReconNet, SAM-Med3D), benchmarked against
expert contours on whole and click-point cropped images. Segmentation
reproducibility was assessed using 497 PySERA-extracted radiomic features via
Spearman correlation, ICC, Wilcoxon tests, and MANOVA, while prognostic
modeling compared supervised (SL) and semi-supervised learning (SSL) across 38
dimensionality reduction strategies and 24 classifiers. Six physicians
qualitatively evaluated masks across seven domains, including clinical
meaningfulness, boundary quality, prognostic value, trust, and workflow
integration. VNet achieved the best performance (Dice = 0.83, IoU = 0.71),
radiomic stability (mean correlation = 0.76, ICC = 0.65), and predictive
accuracy under SSL (accuracy = 0.88, F1 = 0.83). SSL consistently outperformed
SL across models. Radiologists favored VNet for peritumoral representation and
smoother boundaries, preferring AI-generated initial masks for refinement
rather than replacement. These results demonstrate that integrating VNet with
SSL yields accurate, reproducible, and clinically trusted CT-based lung cancer
prognosis, highlighting a feasible path toward physician-centered AI
translation.

Abstract: Advanced feature extraction methods have significantly contributed to
enhancing the task of person re-identification. In addition, modifications to
objective functions have been developed to further improve performance.
Nonetheless, selecting better class representatives is an underexplored area of
research that can also lead to advancements in re-identification performance.
Although past works have experimented with using the centroid of a gallery
image class during training, only a few have investigated alternative
representations during the retrieval stage. In this paper, we demonstrate that
these prior techniques yield suboptimal results in terms of re-identification
metrics. To address the re-identification problem, we propose a generalized
selection method that involves choosing representations that are not limited to
class centroids. Our approach strikes a balance between accuracy and mean
average precision, leading to improvements beyond the state of the art. For
example, the actual number of representations per class can be adjusted to meet
specific application requirements. We apply our methodology on top of multiple
re-identification embeddings, and in all cases it substantially improves upon
contemporary results

Abstract: Video reasoning using Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) relies on costly
reinforcement learning (RL) and verbose chain-of-thought, resulting in
substantial computational overhead during both training and inference.
Moreover, the mechanisms that control the thinking process in these reasoning
models are very limited. In this paper, using entropy of the model's output as
a signal, we discover that the high-quality models go through a series of
micro-explorations and micro-exploitations which keep the reasoning process
grounded (i.e., avoid excessive randomness while the model is exploring or
thinking through an answer). We further observe that once this "thinking"
process is over, more accurate models demonstrate a better convergence by
reducing the entropy significantly via a final exploitation phase (i.e., a more
certain convergence towards a solution trajectory). We then use these novel,
theoretically-grounded insights to tune the model's behavior directly at
inference, without using any RL or supervised fine-tuning. Specifically, during
inference, our proposed approach called V-Reason (Video-Reason) adapts the
value cache of the LMM via a few optimization steps on a small, trainable
controller using an entropy-based objective, i.e., no supervision from any
dataset or RL is necessary. This tuning improves the model's micro-exploration
and exploitation behavior during inference. Our experiments show that our
proposed method achieves significant improvements over the base
instruction-tuned models across several video reasoning datasets, narrowing the

TL;DR: 该研究比较了通用视觉基础模型Hiera与专用分割模型SAM2的特征通用性，发现专用化虽然提升了空间相关任务性能，但在概念距离较远的任务上表现较差，存在可测量的语义信息损失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解通用基础视觉模型与专用模型之间的权衡对于高效特征编码设计至关重要，但目前这一权衡尚未被充分理解。

Method: 使用轻量级可训练颈部网络来探测冻结特征的可适应性，量化专用化的信息论成本，并进行跨颈部分析。

Result: SAM2在深度估计等空间相关任务上表现出色，但在姿态估计和图像描述等概念距离较远的任务上表现不如通用模型Hiera，且每一层适应都会产生额外的表征瓶颈。

Conclusion: 专用化在提升特定任务性能的同时会损失更广泛的语义信息，这为设计高效特征编码和适应策略提供了量化基础。

Abstract: The trade-off between general-purpose foundation vision models and their
specialized counterparts is critical for efficient feature coding design and is
not yet fully understood. We investigate this trade-off by comparing the
feature versatility of the general-purpose Hiera encoder against the
segmentation-specialized Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2). Using a lightweight,
trainable neck to probe the adaptability of their frozen features, we quantify
the information-theoretic cost of specialization. Our results reveal that while
SAM2's specialization is highly effective for spatially-related tasks like
depth estimation, it comes at a cost. The specialized SAM2 encoder
underperforms its generalist predecessor, Hiera, on conceptually distant tasks
such as pose estimation and image captioning, demonstrating a measurable loss
of broader semantic information. A novel cross-neck analysis on SAM2 reveals
that each level of adaptation creates a further representational bottleneck.
Our analysis illuminates these trade-offs in feature universality, providing a
quantitative foundation for designing efficient feature coding and adaptation
strategies for diverse downstream applications.

TL;DR: 提出ProDAT方法，通过密度感知的尾丢弃机制实现点云渐进式编码，在单一模型中支持多比特率解码，显著提升编码效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D点云在自动驾驶、增强现实等应用中需要实时处理和低延迟，但大数据量和带宽限制阻碍了高质量服务的部署。现有学习型点云几何编码方法的固定潜在表示不支持渐进式解码。

Method: 提出ProDAT方法，利用密度信息作为指导信号，根据重要性自适应解码潜在特征和坐标，实现单一模型的多比特率渐进式解码。

Result: 在基准数据集上的实验结果表明，ProDAT不仅实现了渐进式编码，而且在编码效率上优于最先进的学习型编码技术，在SemanticKITTI上PSNR-D2的BD-rate提升超过28.6%，在ShapeNet上超过18.15%。

Conclusion: ProDAT方法成功解决了点云渐进式编码问题，在保持高编码效率的同时支持多比特率解码，为资源受限环境下的点云应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) point clouds are becoming increasingly vital in
applications such as autonomous driving, augmented reality, and immersive
communication, demanding real-time processing and low latency. However, their
large data volumes and bandwidth constraints hinder the deployment of
high-quality services in resource-limited environments. Progres- sive coding,
which allows for decoding at varying levels of detail, provides an alternative
by allowing initial partial decoding with subsequent refinement. Although
recent learning-based point cloud geometry coding methods have achieved notable
success, their fixed latent representation does not support progressive
decoding. To bridge this gap, we propose ProDAT, a novel density-aware
tail-drop mechanism for progressive point cloud coding. By leveraging density
information as a guidance signal, latent features and coordinates are decoded
adaptively based on their significance, therefore achieving progressive
decoding at multiple bitrates using one single model. Experimental results on
benchmark datasets show that the proposed ProDAT not only enables progressive
coding but also achieves superior coding efficiency compared to
state-of-the-art learning-based coding techniques, with over 28.6% BD-rate
improvement for PSNR- D2 on SemanticKITTI and over 18.15% for ShapeNet

Motivation: 多模态目标检测在挑战性条件下通过利用多个传感器模态的互补线索来提高鲁棒性，但现有方法往往针对特定数据集设计，缺乏通用性。

Method: 提出FMCAF架构，包含频域滤波块(Freq-Filter)来抑制冗余频谱特征，以及基于跨注意力的融合模块(MCAF)来改善模态间特征共享。

Result: 在LLVIP(低光行人检测)和VEDAI(航空车辆检测)数据集上，FMCAF优于传统融合方法，在VEDAI上mAP@50提升13.9%，在LLVIP上提升1.1%。

Abstract: Multimodal object detection improves robustness in chal- lenging conditions
by leveraging complementary cues from multiple sensor modalities. We introduce
Filtered Multi- Modal Cross Attention Fusion (FMCAF), a preprocess- ing
architecture designed to enhance the fusion of RGB and infrared (IR) inputs.
FMCAF combines a frequency- domain filtering block (Freq-Filter) to suppress
redun- dant spectral features with a cross-attention-based fusion module (MCAF)
to improve intermodal feature sharing. Unlike approaches tailored to specific
datasets, FMCAF aims for generalizability, improving performance across
different multimodal challenges without requiring dataset- specific tuning. On
LLVIP (low-light pedestrian detec- tion) and VEDAI (aerial vehicle detection),
FMCAF outper- forms traditional fusion (concatenation), achieving +13.9% mAP@50
on VEDAI and +1.1% on LLVIP. These results support the potential of FMCAF as a
flexible foundation for robust multimodal fusion in future detection pipelines.

TL;DR: GSPlane通过引入平面先验来改进高斯泼溅的几何重建，特别针对平面区域提供更平滑精确的网格表示，同时保持渲染质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有高斯泼溅方法在重建平面区域时存在平滑度和精度不足的问题，而平面是3D场景中的重要基元，特别是人造环境中。结构化平面表示有助于下游场景编辑和物理模拟应用。

Method: 利用现成的分割和法向预测模型提取平面先验，建立结构化平面高斯坐标表示；引入动态高斯重分类器自适应地将高梯度平面高斯重新分类为非平面；利用优化后的平面先验改进网格布局。

Result: 在保持渲染质量的同时，显著提高了提取网格的几何精度，减少了顶点和面数，改善了拓扑结构。

Conclusion: GSPlane通过平面先验的引入有效解决了高斯泼溅在平面重建中的局限性，为场景编辑和物理模拟提供了更好的结构化表示。

Abstract: Planes are fundamental primitives of 3D sences, especially in man-made
environments such as indoor spaces and urban streets. Representing these planes
in a structured and parameterized format facilitates scene editing and physical
simulations in downstream applications. Recently, Gaussian Splatting (GS) has
demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in the Novel View Synthesis task, with
extensions showing great potential in accurate surface reconstruction. However,
even state-of-the-art GS representations often struggle to reconstruct planar
regions with sufficient smoothness and precision. To address this issue, we
propose GSPlane, which recovers accurate geometry and produces clean and
well-structured mesh connectivity for plane regions in the reconstructed scene.
By leveraging off-the-shelf segmentation and normal prediction models, GSPlane
extracts robust planar priors to establish structured representations for
planar Gaussian coordinates, which help guide the training process by enforcing
geometric consistency. To further enhance training robustness, a Dynamic
Gaussian Re-classifier is introduced to adaptively reclassify planar Gaussians
with persistently high gradients as non-planar, ensuring more reliable
optimization. Furthermore, we utilize the optimized planar priors to refine the
mesh layouts, significantly improving topological structure while reducing the
number of vertices and faces. We also explore applications of the structured
planar representation, which enable decoupling and flexible manipulation of
objects on supportive planes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, with no
sacrifice in rendering quality, the introduction of planar priors significantly
improves the geometric accuracy of the extracted meshes across various
baselines.

Motivation: 预训练扩散方法在低层视觉任务中表现出色，但往往以牺牲内容保真度为代价来获得更高的感知真实性，这一问题在低光场景中尤为严重。

Result: 大量实验表明该方法显著提升了预训练扩散方法的保真度表现。

Conclusion: 所提出的即插即用方法能够无缝集成到现有扩散网络中，提供更有效的控制，在保持真实性和美学的同时增强保真度。

Abstract: Diffusion-based methods, leveraging pre-trained large models like Stable
Diffusion via ControlNet, have achieved remarkable performance in several
low-level vision tasks. However, Pre-Trained Diffusion-Based (PTDB) methods
often sacrifice content fidelity to attain higher perceptual realism. This
issue is exacerbated in low-light scenarios, where severely degraded
information caused by the darkness limits effective control. We identify two
primary causes of fidelity loss: the absence of suitable conditional latent
modeling and the lack of bidirectional interaction between the conditional
latent and noisy latent in the diffusion process. To address this, we propose a
novel optimization strategy for conditioning in pre-trained diffusion models,
enhancing fidelity while preserving realism and aesthetics. Our method
introduces a mechanism to recover spatial details lost during VAE encoding,
i.e., a latent refinement pipeline incorporating generative priors.
Additionally, the refined latent condition interacts dynamically with the noisy
latent, leading to improved restoration performance. Our approach is
plug-and-play, seamlessly integrating into existing diffusion networks to
provide more effective control. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant
fidelity improvements in PTDB methods.

Motivation: 开发一种视觉不可见但相机可检测的水印技术，用于隐私保护和内容验证，同时避免传统可见光通信的高帧率要求。

Method: 采用光谱调制而非强度调制，综合考虑人眼视觉系统敏感性、相机传感器光谱敏感性和LED产生白光的能力，优化LED光谱特征以实现不可见水印嵌入。

Result: 能够在标准低帧率（30-60 fps）下提取水印，10秒视频片段可嵌入128位信息，足以支持隐私保护和内容验证的元数据。

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了视觉不可见的水印技术，为消费级相机提供了实用的隐私保护和内容验证解决方案。

Abstract: This paper introduces a method for using LED-based environmental lighting to
produce visually imperceptible watermarks for consumer cameras. Our approach
optimizes an LED light source's spectral profile to be minimally visible to the
human eye while remaining highly detectable by typical consumer cameras. The
method jointly considers the human visual system's sensitivity to visible
spectra, modern consumer camera sensors' spectral sensitivity, and narrowband
LEDs' ability to generate broadband spectra perceived as "white light"
(specifically, D65 illumination). To ensure imperceptibility, we employ
spectral modulation rather than intensity modulation. Unlike conventional
visible light communication, our approach enables watermark extraction at
standard low frame rates (30-60 fps). While the information transfer rate is
modest-embedding 128 bits within a 10-second video clip-this capacity is
sufficient for essential metadata supporting privacy protection and content
verification.

Motivation: 现有方法基于文本条件嵌入扰动，存在语义不稳定和多样性不足的问题，限制了在真实OOD场景中的泛化能力

Method: 使用现成ID分类器直接引导扩散采样轨迹，包含图像级引导（基于对数分割梯度减少输入似然）和特征级引导（基于k-NN距离促进特征稀疏区域采样）

Result: GOOD生成的样本能显著提升OOD检测性能，通过定量和定性分析验证了其有效性

Conclusion: GOOD框架通过双重引导机制实现了更可控和多样化的OOD样本生成，提出的统一OOD评分增强了检测鲁棒性

Abstract: Recent advancements have explored text-to-image diffusion models for
synthesizing out-of-distribution (OOD) samples, substantially enhancing the
performance of OOD detection. However, existing approaches typically rely on
perturbing text-conditioned embeddings, resulting in semantic instability and
insufficient shift diversity, which limit generalization to realistic OOD. To
address these challenges, we propose GOOD, a novel and flexible framework that
directly guides diffusion sampling trajectories towards OOD regions using
off-the-shelf in-distribution (ID) classifiers. GOOD incorporates dual-level
guidance: (1) Image-level guidance based on the gradient of log partition to
reduce input likelihood, drives samples toward low-density regions in pixel
space. (2) Feature-level guidance, derived from k-NN distance in the
classifier's latent space, promotes sampling in feature-sparse regions. Hence,
this dual-guidance design enables more controllable and diverse OOD sample
generation. Additionally, we introduce a unified OOD score that adaptively
combines image and feature discrepancies, enhancing detection robustness. We
perform thorough quantitative and qualitative analyses to evaluate the
effectiveness of GOOD, demonstrating that training with samples generated by
GOOD can notably enhance OOD detection performance.

Conclusion: KineDiff3D框架有效解决了铰接物体的3D重建和姿态估计问题，为处理结构多样性提供了统一解决方案。

Abstract: Articulated objects, such as laptops and drawers, exhibit significant
challenges for 3D reconstruction and pose estimation due to their multi-part
geometries and variable joint configurations, which introduce structural
diversity across different states. To address these challenges, we propose
KineDiff3D: Kinematic-Aware Diffusion for Category-Level Articulated Object
Shape Reconstruction and Generation, a unified framework for reconstructing
diverse articulated instances and pose estimation from single view input.
Specifically, we first encode complete geometry (SDFs), joint angles, and part
segmentation into a structured latent space via a novel Kinematic-Aware VAE
(KA-VAE). In addition, we employ two conditional diffusion models: one for
regressing global pose (SE(3)) and joint parameters, and another for generating
the kinematic-aware latent code from partial observations. Finally, we produce
an iterative optimization module that bidirectionally refines reconstruction
accuracy and kinematic parameters via Chamfer-distance minimization while
preserving articulation constraints. Experimental results on synthetic,
semi-synthetic, and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach in accurately reconstructing articulated objects and estimating their
kinematic properties.

Result: 在DeepCAD和Fusion360数据集上的实验表明，GACO-CAD在相同MLLM骨干下达到最先进性能，在代码有效性、几何精度和建模简洁性方面均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GACO-CAD通过结合几何先验和简洁建模奖励，有效提升了从单张图像生成参数化CAD模型的几何准确性和建模效率。

Abstract: Generating editable, parametric CAD models from a single image holds great
potential to lower the barriers of industrial concept design. However, current
multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) still struggle with accurately
inferring 3D geometry from 2D images due to limited spatial reasoning
capabilities. We address this limitation by introducing GACO-CAD, a novel
two-stage post-training framework. It is designed to achieve a joint objective:
simultaneously improving the geometric accuracy of the generated CAD models and
encouraging the use of more concise modeling procedures. First, during
supervised fine-tuning, we leverage depth and surface normal maps as dense
geometric priors, combining them with the RGB image to form a multi-channel
input. In the context of single-view reconstruction, these priors provide
complementary spatial cues that help the MLLM more reliably recover 3D geometry
from 2D observations. Second, during reinforcement learning, we introduce a
group length reward that, while preserving high geometric fidelity, promotes
the generation of more compact and less redundant parametric modeling
sequences. A simple dynamic weighting strategy is adopted to stabilize
training. Experiments on the DeepCAD and Fusion360 datasets show that GACO-CAD
achieves state-of-the-art performance under the same MLLM backbone,
consistently outperforming existing methods in terms of code validity,
geometric accuracy, and modeling conciseness.

Abstract: Face Recognition (FR) models have been shown to be vulnerable to adversarial
examples that subtly alter benign facial images, exposing blind spots in these
systems, as well as protecting user privacy. End-to-end FR systems first obtain
preprocessed faces from diverse facial imagery prior to computing the
similarity of the deep feature embeddings. Whilst face preprocessing is a
critical component of FR systems, and hence adversarial attacks against them,
we observe that this preprocessing is often overlooked in blackbox settings.
Our study seeks to investigate the transferability of several out-of-the-box
state-of-the-art adversarial attacks against FR when applied against different
preprocessing techniques used in a blackbox setting. We observe that the choice
of face detection model can degrade the attack success rate by up to 78%,
whereas choice of interpolation method during downsampling has relatively
minimal impacts. Furthermore, we find that the requirement for facial
preprocessing even degrades attack strength in a whitebox setting, due to the
unintended interaction of produced noise vectors against face detection models.
Based on these findings, we propose a preprocessing-invariant method using
input transformations that improves the transferability of the studied attacks
by up to 27%. Our findings highlight the importance of preprocessing in FR
systems, and the need for its consideration towards improving the adversarial
generalisation of facial adversarial examples.

Motivation: 解决MAR模型在视觉生成中并行生成能力受限的问题，因为单步建模空间相关视觉token的复杂性限制了其加速潜力。

Method: 提出GtR策略：第一阶段结构生成建立全局语义框架，第二阶段细节重建高效完成剩余token。还提出FTS方法，基于高频信息能量为图像细节token分配更多计算资源。

Conclusion: GtR方法在各种模型规模和生成任务中显著优于现有加速方法，证明了分层生成策略的有效性。

Abstract: Masked Autoregressive (MAR) models promise better efficiency in visual
generation than autoregressive (AR) models for the ability of parallel
generation, yet their acceleration potential remains constrained by the
modeling complexity of spatially correlated visual tokens in a single step. To
address this limitation, we introduce Generation then Reconstruction (GtR), a
training-free hierarchical sampling strategy that decomposes generation into
two stages: structure generation establishing global semantic scaffolding,
followed by detail reconstruction efficiently completing remaining tokens.
Assuming that it is more difficult to create an image from scratch than to
complement images based on a basic image framework, GtR is designed to achieve
acceleration by computing the reconstruction stage quickly while maintaining
the generation quality by computing the generation stage slowly. Moreover,
observing that tokens on the details of an image often carry more semantic
information than tokens in the salient regions, we further propose
Frequency-Weighted Token Selection (FTS) to offer more computation budget to
tokens on image details, which are localized based on the energy of high
frequency information. Extensive experiments on ImageNet class-conditional and
text-to-image generation demonstrate 3.72x speedup on MAR-H while maintaining
comparable quality (e.g., FID: 1.59, IS: 304.4 vs. original 1.59, 299.1),
substantially outperforming existing acceleration methods across various model
scales and generation tasks. Our codes will be released in

Abstract: Automated plankton recognition models face significant challenges during
real-world deployment due to distribution shifts (Out-of-Distribution, OoD)
between training and test data. This stems from plankton's complex
morphologies, vast species diversity, and the continuous discovery of novel
species, which leads to unpredictable errors during inference. Despite rapid
advancements in OoD detection methods in recent years, the field of plankton
recognition still lacks a systematic integration of the latest computer vision
developments and a unified benchmark for large-scale evaluation. To address
this, this paper meticulously designed a series of OoD benchmarks simulating
various distribution shift scenarios based on the DYB-PlanktonNet dataset
\cite{875n-f104-21}, and systematically evaluated twenty-two OoD detection
methods. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the ViM
\cite{wang2022vim} method significantly outperforms other approaches in our
constructed benchmarks, particularly excelling in Far-OoD scenarios with
substantial improvements in key metrics. This comprehensive evaluation not only
provides a reliable reference for algorithm selection in automated plankton
recognition but also lays a solid foundation for future research in plankton
OoD detection. To our knowledge, this study marks the first large-scale,
systematic evaluation and analysis of Out-of-Distribution data detection
methods in plankton recognition. Code is available at

Abstract: Photorealistic 3D head avatars are vital for telepresence, gaming, and VR.
However, most methods focus solely on facial regions, ignoring natural
hand-face interactions, such as a hand resting on the chin or fingers gently
touching the cheek, which convey cognitive states like pondering. In this work,
we present a novel framework that jointly learns detailed head avatars and the
non-rigid deformations induced by hand-face interactions.
  There are two principal challenges in this task. First, naively tracking hand
and face separately fails to capture their relative poses. To overcome this, we
propose to combine depth order loss with contact regularization during pose
tracking, ensuring correct spatial relationships between the face and hand.
Second, no publicly available priors exist for hand-induced deformations,
making them non-trivial to learn from monocular videos. To address this, we
learn a PCA basis specific to hand-induced facial deformations from a face-hand
interaction dataset. This reduces the problem to estimating a compact set of
PCA parameters rather than a full spatial deformation field. Furthermore,
inspired by physics-based simulation, we incorporate a contact loss that
provides additional supervision, significantly reducing interpenetration
artifacts and enhancing the physical plausibility of the results.
  We evaluate our approach on RGB(D) videos captured by an iPhone.
Additionally, to better evaluate the reconstructed geometry, we construct a
synthetic dataset of avatars with various types of hand interactions. We show
that our method can capture better appearance and more accurate deforming
geometry of the face than SOTA surface reconstruction methods.

Method: 使用GPT引导的扩散进行领域增强；提出切线CutMix进行曲率感知插值；结合惩罚Busemann对齐、混合双曲对比正则化和自适应离群排斥的统一损失；可学习曲率参数适应数据集复杂度。

Result: 在PACS、Office-Home和DomainNet数据集上达到最先进性能，持续优于现有的欧几里得和双曲(DG)-GCD基线方法。

Conclusion: HIDISC通过双曲几何表示学习有效解决了领域泛化与广义类别发现问题，避免了复杂训练模拟，实现了高效且鲁棒的泛化能力。

Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) aims to classify test-time samples into
either seen categories** -- available during training -- or novel ones, without
relying on label supervision. Most existing GCD methods assume simultaneous
access to labeled and unlabeled data during training and arising from the same
domain, limiting applicability in open-world scenarios involving distribution
shifts. Domain Generalization with GCD (DG-GCD) lifts this constraint by
requiring models to generalize to unseen domains containing novel categories,
without accessing targetdomain data during training. The only prior DG-GCD
method, DG2CD-Net, relies on episodic training with multiple synthetic domains
and task vector aggregation, incurring high computational cost and error
accumulation. We propose HIDISC, a hyperbolic representation learning framework
that achieves domain and category-level generalization without episodic
simulation. To expose the model to minimal but diverse domain variations, we
augment the source domain using GPT-guided diffusion, avoiding overfitting
while maintaining efficiency. To structure the representation space, we
introduce Tangent CutMix, a curvature-aware interpolation that synthesizes
pseudo-novel samples in tangent space, preserving manifold consistency. A
unified loss -- combining penalized Busemann alignment, hybrid hyperbolic
contrastive regularization, and adaptive outlier repulsion -- **facilitates
compact, semantically structured embeddings. A learnable curvature parameter
further adapts the geometry to dataset complexity. HIDISC achieves
state-of-the-art results on PACS , Office-Home , and DomainNet, consistently
outperforming the existing Euclidean and hyperbolic (DG)-GCD baselines.

*Pu Zhang,Yuwei Li,Xingyuan Xian,Guoming Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种零样本的视觉token剪枝方法，通过平衡任务相关性和信息多样性，在保持性能的同时显著降低推理成本


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着视觉语言模型处理能力增强，视觉token冗余导致推理成本过高，现有方法忽视文本提示的指导，无法优先考虑任务相关性

Method: 分层方法：先选择任务相关的核心视觉token，再补充多样性token以保留更广泛上下文，采用提示感知的剪枝策略

Result: 在多个模型和基准测试中，即使剪枝90%的token，性能仍匹配或超越最先进方法，仅损失最小精度，同时显著降低GPU内存占用和推理延迟

Conclusion: 该方法通过提示感知的视觉token剪枝，在保持模型性能的同时大幅降低计算成本，为高效视觉语言模型推理提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: As the capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) advance, they can
process increasingly large inputs, which, unlike in LLMs, generates significant
visual token redundancy and leads to prohibitive inference costs. While many
methods aim to reduce these costs by pruning visual tokens, existing
approaches, whether based on attention or diversity, typically neglect the
guidance of the text prompt and thus fail to prioritize task relevance. In this
work, we propose a novel, zero-shot method that reframes the problem by
introducing a prompt-aware perspective, explicitly modeling visual token
pruning as a balance between task relevance and information diversity. Our
hierarchical approach first selects a core set of task-relevant visual tokens
and then supplements them with diversity tokens to preserve broader context.
Experiments across multiple models and benchmarks show that our method achieves
performance that matches or surpasses the state-of-the-art with only minimal
accuracy loss, even when pruning up to 90\% of the tokens. Furthermore, these
gains are accompanied by significant reductions in GPU memory footprint and
inference latency.

TL;DR: 使用Segment Anything Model (SAM)来监测孟加拉国河流侵蚀，通过微调模型识别河岸侵蚀特征，在消失的定居点数据集上取得了86.30%的IoU和92.60%的Dice分数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 孟加拉国河流每年吞噬村庄和农田，造成社区消失和大量人口流离失所。传统方法难以准确追踪这种缓慢的灾难过程。

Method: 首先使用简单的颜色通道分析进行粗略的土地和水域分割，然后微调SAM的掩码解码器以识别河岸侵蚀的细微特征。

Result: 模型在河岸侵蚀识别方面表现出色，平均IoU达到86.30%，Dice分数达到92.60%，显著优于传统方法和现成的深度学习模型。

Conclusion: 这项工作提供了三个关键贡献：首个包含因河流侵蚀而消失定居点的标注数据集；专门为此任务微调的AI模型；以及通过视觉证据量化土地损失的方法，为政策制定者和灾害管理机构提供了强大的监测工具。

Abstract: The great rivers of Bangladesh, arteries of commerce and sustenance, are also
agents of relentless destruction. Each year, they swallow whole villages and
vast tracts of farmland, erasing communities from the map and displacing
thousands of families. To track this slow-motion catastrophe has, until now,
been a Herculean task for human analysts. Here we show how a powerful
general-purpose vision model, the Segment Anything Model (SAM), can be adapted
to this task with remarkable precision. To do this, we assembled a new dataset
- a digital chronicle of loss compiled from historical Google Earth imagery of
Bangladesh's most vulnerable regions, including Mokterer Char Union, Kedarpur
Union, Balchipara village, and Chowhali Upazila, from 2003 to 2025. Crucially,
this dataset is the first to include manually annotated data on the settlements
that have vanished beneath the water. Our method first uses a simple
color-channel analysis to provide a rough segmentation of land and water, and
then fine-tunes SAM's mask decoder to recognize the subtle signatures of
riverbank erosion. The resulting model demonstrates a keen eye for this
destructive process, achieving a mean Intersection over Union of 86.30% and a
Dice score of 92.60% - a performance that significantly surpasses traditional
methods and off-the-shelf deep learning models. This work delivers three key
contributions: the first annotated dataset of disappeared settlements in
Bangladesh due to river erosion; a specialized AI model fine-tuned for this
critical task; and a method for quantifying land loss with compelling visual
evidence. Together, these tools provide a powerful new lens through which
policymakers and disaster management agencies can monitor erosion, anticipate
its trajectory, and ultimately protect the vulnerable communities in its path.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究针对FPS游戏VALORANT，通过分析比赛录像中的小地图信息构建回合结果预测模型，利用TimeSformer视频识别模型结合战术特征，在数据增强后达到约81%的预测准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有电竞比赛结果预测研究多基于比赛日志数据和统计信息，而VALORANT作为需要复杂策略的FPS游戏，需要更深入分析比赛录像中的战术信息来提升预测准确性。

Method: 基于TimeSformer视频识别模型，从小地图信息中提取详细的战术特征（如角色位置信息和游戏内事件），构建回合结果预测模型。

Result: 在增强战术事件标签的数据集上训练的模型达到约81%的预测准确率，特别是在回合中后期阶段显著优于仅使用小地图信息本身的模型。

Conclusion: 利用比赛录像中的战术特征对于预测VALORANT回合结果非常有效，证明了战术分析在电竞预测中的重要性。

Abstract: Recently, research on predicting match outcomes in esports has been actively
conducted, but much of it is based on match log data and statistical
information. This research targets the FPS game VALORANT, which requires
complex strategies, and aims to build a round outcome prediction model by
analyzing minimap information in match footage. Specifically, based on the
video recognition model TimeSformer, we attempt to improve prediction accuracy
by incorporating detailed tactical features extracted from minimap information,
such as character position information and other in-game events. This paper
reports preliminary results showing that a model trained on a dataset augmented
with such tactical event labels achieved approximately 81% prediction accuracy,
especially from the middle phases of a round onward, significantly
outperforming a model trained on a dataset with the minimap information itself.
This suggests that leveraging tactical features from match footage is highly
effective for predicting round outcomes in VALORANT.

TL;DR: EndoCIL是一个专门为内窥镜图像诊断设计的类增量学习框架，通过三个关键组件解决领域差异和类别不平衡问题，在多个数据集上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 内窥镜图像分析需要模型能够持续适应新的临床数据，同时保持对已学习类别的性能。现有基于回放的类增量学习方法由于内窥镜图像中严重的领域差异和类别不平衡问题，无法有效缓解灾难性遗忘。

Method: EndoCIL包含三个核心组件：基于最大均值差异的回放选择策略(MDBR)选择多样化和代表性样本；先验正则化类别平衡损失(PRCBL)缓解阶段间和阶段内类别不平衡；全连接梯度校准(CFG)调整分类器梯度以减少对新类别的偏置。

Result: 在四个公共内窥镜数据集上的广泛实验表明，EndoCIL在不同缓冲区大小和评估指标下通常优于最先进的类增量学习方法。

Conclusion: 该框架有效平衡了终身内窥镜诊断中的稳定性和可塑性，显示出在临床可扩展性和部署方面的良好潜力。

Abstract: Class-incremental learning (CIL) for endoscopic image analysis is crucial for
real-world clinical applications, where diagnostic models should continuously
adapt to evolving clinical data while retaining performance on previously
learned ones. However, existing replay-based CIL methods fail to effectively
mitigate catastrophic forgetting due to severe domain discrepancies and class
imbalance inherent in endoscopic imaging. To tackle these challenges, we
propose EndoCIL, a novel and unified CIL framework specifically tailored for
endoscopic image diagnosis. EndoCIL incorporates three key components: Maximum
Mean Discrepancy Based Replay (MDBR), employing a distribution-aligned greedy
strategy to select diverse and representative exemplars, Prior Regularized
Class Balanced Loss (PRCBL), designed to alleviate both inter-phase and
intra-phase class imbalance by integrating prior class distributions and
balance weights into the loss function, and Calibration of Fully-Connected
Gradients (CFG), which adjusts the classifier gradients to mitigate bias toward
new classes. Extensive experiments conducted on four public endoscopic datasets
demonstrate that EndoCIL generally outperforms state-of-the-art CIL methods
across varying buffer sizes and evaluation metrics. The proposed framework
effectively balances stability and plasticity in lifelong endoscopic diagnosis,
showing promising potential for clinical scalability and deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人脸识别系统易受欺骗攻击，攻击者可能使用注册用户的照片绕过认证，因此需要在人脸识别前检测此类欺骗攻击。

Method: 使用带寄存器的DINOv2提取可泛化特征，抑制注意力机制中的扰动，从而聚焦于关键细微特征。

Result: 在ICCV2025第六届人脸反欺骗研讨会提供的统一物理-数字攻击检测数据集和SiW数据集上验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的DINOv2基活体检测方法能够有效检测人脸欺骗攻击，提高人脸识别系统的安全性。

Abstract: Face recognition systems are designed to be robust against variations in head
pose, illumination, and image blur during capture. However, malicious actors
can exploit these systems by presenting a face photo of a registered user,
potentially bypassing the authentication process. Such spoofing attacks must be
detected prior to face recognition. In this paper, we propose a DINOv2-based
spoofing attack detection method to discern minute differences between live and
spoofed face images. Specifically, we employ DINOv2 with registers to extract
generalizable features and to suppress perturbations in the attention
mechanism, which enables focused attention on essential and minute features. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method through experiments
conducted on the dataset provided by ``The 6th Face Anti-Spoofing Workshop:
Unified Physical-Digital Attacks Detection@ICCV2025'' and SiW dataset.

TL;DR: 本文提出VisiPruner，一种无需训练的剪枝框架，通过分析MLLMs的三阶段跨模态交互过程，显著减少视觉相关注意力计算和FLOPs。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在视觉语言任务中表现优异，但面临计算开销大的问题，现有剪枝方法缺乏对MLLMs处理多模态信息机制的基本理解。

Method: 通过系统分析发现MLLMs存在三阶段跨模态交互过程，基于此提出VisiPruner剪枝框架，在特定层选择性剪枝视觉token。

Result: 在LLaVA-v1.5 7B上减少99%的视觉相关注意力计算和53.9%的FLOPs，显著优于现有token剪枝方法，且能泛化到不同MLLMs。

Conclusion: 研究不仅提供了有效的剪枝方法，还为训练高效MLLMs提供了可操作的指导原则，即模型架构应与内在的层级处理动态对齐。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved strong performance
across vision-language tasks, but suffer from significant computational
overhead due to the quadratic growth of attention computations with the number
of multimodal tokens. Though efforts have been made to prune tokens in MLLMs,
\textit{they lack a fundamental understanding of how MLLMs process and fuse
multimodal information.} Through systematic analysis, we uncover a
\textbf{three-stage} cross-modal interaction process: (1) Shallow layers
recognize task intent, with visual tokens acting as passive attention sinks;
(2) Cross-modal fusion occurs abruptly in middle layers, driven by a few
critical visual tokens; (3) Deep layers discard vision tokens, focusing solely
on linguistic refinement. Based on these findings, we propose
\emph{VisiPruner}, a training-free pruning framework that reduces up to 99\% of
vision-related attention computations and 53.9\% of FLOPs on LLaVA-v1.5 7B. It
significantly outperforms existing token pruning methods and generalizes across
diverse MLLMs. Beyond pruning, our insights further provide actionable
guidelines for training efficient MLLMs by aligning model architecture with its
intrinsic layer-wise processing dynamics. Our code is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时刻检索方法专注于单时刻检索，但真实应用中一个查询可能对应多个相关时刻，现有数据集和方法不足以满足视频时序定位需求。

Method: 提出FlashMMR框架，包含多时刻后验证模块来精炼时刻边界，采用约束时序调整和验证模块重新评估候选片段，通过复杂过滤管道修剪低置信度提议。

Result: 在QV-M²数据集上，FlashMMR相比之前SOTA方法在G-mAP上提升3.00%，mAP@3+tgt提升2.70%，mR@3提升2.56%。

Conclusion: QV-M²数据集和FlashMMR方法为推进更现实和具有挑战性的视频时序定位研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Existing Moment retrieval (MR) methods focus on Single-Moment Retrieval
(SMR). However, one query can correspond to multiple relevant moments in
real-world applications. This makes the existing datasets and methods
insufficient for video temporal grounding. By revisiting the gap between
current MR tasks and real-world applications, we introduce a high-quality
datasets called QVHighlights Multi-Moment Dataset (QV-M$^2$), along with new
evaluation metrics tailored for multi-moment retrieval (MMR). QV-M$^2$ consists
of 2,212 annotations covering 6,384 video segments. Building on existing
efforts in MMR, we propose a framework called FlashMMR. Specifically, we
propose a Multi-moment Post-verification module to refine the moment
boundaries. We introduce constrained temporal adjustment and subsequently
leverage a verification module to re-evaluate the candidate segments. Through
this sophisticated filtering pipeline, low-confidence proposals are pruned, and
robust multi-moment alignment is achieved. We retrain and evaluate 6 existing
MR methods on QV-M$^2$ and QVHighlights under both SMR and MMR settings.
Results show that QV-M$^2$ serves as an effective benchmark for training and
evaluating MMR models, while FlashMMR provides a strong baseline. Specifically,
on QV-M$^2$, it achieves improvements over prior SOTA method by 3.00% on G-mAP,
2.70% on mAP@3+tgt, and 2.56% on mR@3. The proposed benchmark and method
establish a foundation for advancing research in more realistic and challenging
video temporal grounding scenarios. Code is released at

Conclusion: 该框架有效提升了深度伪造检测的公平性和可解释性，在多个数据集和SoTA架构上表现出色。

Abstract: Existing deepfake detection methods often exhibit bias, lack transparency,
and fail to capture temporal information, leading to biased decisions and
unreliable results across different demographic groups. In this paper, we
propose a fairness-aware deepfake detection framework that integrates temporal
feature learning and demographic-aware data augmentation to enhance fairness
and interpretability. Our method leverages sequence-based clustering for
temporal modeling of deepfake videos and concept extraction to improve
detection reliability while also facilitating interpretable decisions for
non-expert users. Additionally, we introduce a demography-aware data
augmentation method that balances underrepresented groups and applies
frequency-domain transformations to preserve deepfake artifacts, thereby
mitigating bias and improving generalization. Extensive experiments on
FaceForensics++, DFD, Celeb-DF, and DFDC datasets using state-of-the-art (SoTA)
architectures (Xception, ResNet) demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed
method in obtaining the best tradeoff between fairness and accuracy when
compared to SoTA.

Abstract: The advancement of vision-language models (VLMs) is hampered by a fragmented
landscape of inconsistent and contaminated public datasets. We introduce
FineVision, a meticulously collected, curated, and unified corpus of 24 million
samples - the largest open resource of its kind. We unify more than 200 sources
into 185 subsets via a semi-automated, human-in-the-loop pipeline: automation
performs bulk ingestion and schema mapping, while reviewers audit mappings and
spot-check outputs to verify faithful consumption of annotations, appropriate
formatting and diversity, and safety; issues trigger targeted fixes and
re-runs. The workflow further applies rigorous de-duplication within and across
sources and decontamination against 66 public benchmarks. FineVision also
encompasses agentic/GUI tasks with a unified action space; reviewers validate
schemas and inspect a sample of trajectories to confirm executable fidelity.
Models trained on FineVision consistently outperform those trained on existing
open mixtures across a broad evaluation suite, underscoring the benefits of
scale, data hygiene, and balanced automation with human oversight. We release
the corpus and curation tools to accelerate data-centric VLM research.

Abstract: Current autonomous driving systems rely on specialized models for perceiving

conditions. However, generalizing cost-effectively to diverse real-world
scenarios remains a significant challenge. To address this, we propose
Plug-and-Forecast (PnF), a plug-and-play approach that augments existing motion
forecasting models with multimodal large language models (MLLMs). PnF builds on
the insight that natural language provides a more effective way to describe and
handle complex scenarios, enabling quick adaptation to targeted behaviors. We
design prompts to extract structured scene understanding from MLLMs and distill
this information into learnable embeddings to augment existing behavior
prediction models. Our method leverages the zero-shot reasoning capabilities of
MLLMs to achieve significant improvements in motion prediction performance,
while requiring no fine-tuning -- making it practical to adopt. We validate our
approach on two state-of-the-art motion forecasting models using the Waymo Open
Motion Dataset and the nuScenes Dataset, demonstrating consistent performance
improvements across both benchmarks.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation and classification of white blood cells (WBCs) in
microscopic images are essential for diagnosis and monitoring of many
hematological disorders, yet remain challenging due to staining variability,
complex backgrounds, and class imbalance. In this paper, we introduce a novel
Saliency-Guided Cross-Layer Deep Feature Fusion framework (SG-CLDFF) that
tightly integrates saliency-driven preprocessing with multi-scale deep feature
aggregation to improve both robustness and interpretability for WBC analysis.
SG-CLDFF first computes saliency priors to highlight candidate WBC regions and
guide subsequent feature extraction. A lightweight hybrid backbone
(EfficientSwin-style) produces multi-resolution representations, which are
fused by a ResNeXt-CC-inspired cross-layer fusion module to preserve
complementary information from shallow and deep layers. The network is trained
in a multi-task setup with concurrent segmentation and cell-type classification
heads, using class-aware weighted losses and saliency-alignment regularization
to mitigate imbalance and suppress background activation. Interpretability is
enforced through Grad-CAM visualizations and saliency consistency checks,
allowing model decisions to be inspected at the regional level. We validate the
framework on standard public benchmarks (BCCD, LISC, ALL-IDB), reporting
consistent gains in IoU, F1, and classification accuracy compared to strong CNN
and transformer baselines. An ablation study also demonstrates the individual
contributions of saliency preprocessing and cross-layer fusion. SG-CLDFF offers
a practical and explainable path toward more reliable automated WBC analysis in
clinical workflows.

Abstract: Effortless and ergonomically designed surgical lighting is critical for
precision and safety during procedures. However, traditional systems often rely
on manual adjustments, leading to surgeon fatigue, neck strain, and
inconsistent illumination due to drift and shadowing. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel surgical lighting system that leverages the
YOLOv11 object detection algorithm to identify a blue marker placed above the
target surgical site. A high-power LED light source is then directed to the
identified location using two servomotors equipped with tilt-pan brackets. The
YOLO model achieves 96.7% mAP@50 on the validation set consisting of annotated
images simulating surgical scenes with the blue spherical marker. By automating
the lighting process, this machine vision-based solution reduces physical
strain on surgeons, improves consistency in illumination, and supports improved
surgical outcomes.

Motivation: 观察到自监督学习中训练时间过长反而会损害密集预测任务性能的反常现象，需要解决无监督条件下评估密集任务性能的挑战。

Method: 提出了密集表示结构估计器(DSE)，包含类别相关性度量和有效维度度量。基于DSE开发了模型选择策略和正则化方法。

Result: 在16种自监督方法和4个基准测试上的实验表明，模型选择平均提升mIoU 3.0%，DSE正则化能持续缓解密集退化效应。

Conclusion: 自监督密集退化是普遍存在的现象，提出的DSE方法能有效无监督评估密集任务性能，并缓解退化问题。

Abstract: In this work, we observe a counterintuitive phenomenon in self-supervised
learning (SSL): longer training may impair the performance of dense prediction
tasks (e.g., semantic segmentation). We refer to this phenomenon as
Self-supervised Dense Degradation (SDD) and demonstrate its consistent presence
across sixteen state-of-the-art SSL methods with various losses, architectures,
and datasets. When the model performs suboptimally on dense tasks at the end of
training, measuring the performance during training becomes essential. However,
evaluating dense performance effectively without annotations remains an open
challenge. To tackle this issue, we introduce a Dense representation Structure
Estimator (DSE), composed of a class-relevance measure and an effective
dimensionality measure. The proposed DSE is both theoretically grounded and
empirically validated to be closely correlated with the downstream performance.
Based on this metric, we introduce a straightforward yet effective model
selection strategy and a DSE-based regularization method. Experiments on

*ZhaoYang Han,Qihan Lin,Hao Liang,Bowen Chen,Zhou Liu,Wentao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LongInsightBench是首个专门评估模型理解长视频能力的基准测试，重点关注人类语言、观点、动作等上下文元素，整合视觉、音频和文本多模态信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试在评估模型对长视频的理解能力方面存在不足，特别是在处理信息密集的长视频和多模态融合方面。

Method: 从FineVideo数据集中精选约1000个长时信息密集视频，设计6个具有挑战性的任务场景，并开发三步半自动化数据质量保证流程。

Result: 实验结果显示全模态模型在精确时间定位和长距离因果推理任务上仍面临挑战，扩展实验揭示了多模态融合中的信息丢失和处理偏差问题。

Conclusion: LongInsightBench为评估模型长视频理解能力提供了有效基准，揭示了当前全模态模型在多模态融合和复杂推理任务上的局限性。

Abstract: We introduce \textbf{LongInsightBench}, the first benchmark designed to
assess models' ability to understand long videos, with a focus on human
language, viewpoints, actions, and other contextual elements, while integrating
\textbf{visual, audio, and text} modalities. Our benchmark excels in three key
areas: \textbf{a) Long-Duration, Information-Dense Videos:} We carefully select
approximately 1,000 videos from open-source datasets FineVideo based on
duration limit and the information density of both visual and audio modalities,
focusing on content like lectures, interviews, and vlogs, which contain rich
language elements. \textbf{b) Diverse and Challenging Task Scenarios:} We have
designed six challenging task scenarios, including both Intra-Event and
Inter-Event Tasks. \textbf{c) Rigorous and Comprehensive Quality Assurance
Pipelines:} We have developed a three-step, semi-automated data quality
assurance pipeline to ensure the difficulty and validity of the synthesized
questions and answer options. Based on LongInsightBench, we designed a series
of experiments. Experimental results shows that Omni-modal models(OLMs) still
face challenge in tasks requiring precise temporal localization (T-Loc) and
long-range causal inference (CE-Caus). Extended experiments reveal the
information loss and processing bias in multi-modal fusion of OLMs. Our dataset

### [134] [CausalMamba: Scalable Conditional State Space Models for Neural Causal Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17318)
*Sangyoon Bae,Jiook Cha*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CausalMamba是一个可扩展的fMRI因果推断框架，通过两阶段方法解决BOLD信号失真和计算复杂性问题，在模拟数据上比DCM准确率高37%，在真实数据中能恢复88%的已知神经通路。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决fMRI因果推断中的基本限制：从血氧动力学失真的BOLD信号推断神经因果关系的病态性质，以及现有方法（如动态因果建模DCM）的计算不可行性。

Method: 将复杂逆问题分解为两个可处理阶段：BOLD反卷积恢复潜在神经活动，然后使用新颖的条件Mamba架构进行因果图推断。

Result: 在模拟数据上比DCM准确率高37%；在真实任务fMRI数据中恢复88%的已知神经通路，而传统方法在99%以上受试者中无法识别这些典型回路；工作记忆数据分析显示大脑会根据刺激策略性地转移其主要因果枢纽。

Conclusion: 为神经科学家提供了一个实用的工具，用于大规模因果推断，能够捕捉认知功能背后的基本回路模式和灵活网络动态。

Abstract: We introduce CausalMamba, a scalable framework that addresses fundamental
limitations in fMRI-based causal inference: the ill-posed nature of inferring
neural causality from hemodynamically distorted BOLD signals and the
computational intractability of existing methods like Dynamic Causal Modeling
(DCM). Our approach decomposes this complex inverse problem into two tractable
stages: BOLD deconvolution to recover latent neural activity, followed by
causal graph inference using a novel Conditional Mamba architecture. On
simulated data, CausalMamba achieves 37% higher accuracy than DCM. Critically,
when applied to real task fMRI data, our method recovers well-established
neural pathways with 88% fidelity, whereas conventional approaches fail to
identify these canonical circuits in over 99% of subjects. Furthermore, our
network analysis of working memory data reveals that the brain strategically
shifts its primary causal hub-recruiting executive or salience networks
depending on the stimulus-a sophisticated reconfiguration that remains
undetected by traditional methods. This work provides neuroscientists with a
practical tool for large-scale causal inference that captures both fundamental
circuit motifs and flexible network dynamics underlying cognitive function.

*Wei Zhang,Zhanhao Hu,Xiao Li,Xiaopei Zhu,Xiaolin Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文评估了现有对抗防御方法对大规模对抗衣物攻击的防御效果，发现这些防御方法在面对覆盖人体大面积的自然对抗衣物时表现不佳，揭示了现有防御方法的共同脆弱性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实验发现简单扩大补丁尺寸就能使现有对抗补丁防御方法失效，因此需要评估防御方法对覆盖人体大面积的对抗衣物的防御效果，这类攻击比大补丁更自然且更具挑战性。

Method: 通过制作对抗衣物来测试多种防御方法，在数字世界和物理世界中进行实验，并制作单一衣物集来同时突破多个防御方法。

Result: 所有防御方法在对抗衣物攻击下表现都很差，制作的一个衣物集在物理世界中对抗未防御检测器的攻击成功率达96.06%，对抗九个防御模型的攻击成功率均超过64.84%。

Conclusion: 现有对抗防御方法在面对大规模、自然的对抗衣物攻击时存在共同脆弱性，需要开发更鲁棒的防御机制。

Abstract: In recent years, adversarial attacks against deep learning-based object
detectors in the physical world have attracted much attention. To defend
against these attacks, researchers have proposed various defense methods
against adversarial patches, a typical form of physically-realizable attack.
However, our experiments showed that simply enlarging the patch size could make
these defense methods fail. Motivated by this, we evaluated various defense
methods against adversarial clothes which have large coverage over the human
body. Adversarial clothes provide a good test case for adversarial defense
against patch-based attacks because they not only have large sizes but also
look more natural than a large patch on humans. Experiments show that all the
defense methods had poor performance against adversarial clothes in both the
digital world and the physical world. In addition, we crafted a single set of
clothes that broke multiple defense methods on Faster R-CNN. The set achieved
an Attack Success Rate (ASR) of 96.06% against the undefended detector and over
64.84% ASRs against nine defended models in the physical world, unveiling the
common vulnerability of existing adversarial defense methods against
adversarial clothes. Code is available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出CharDiff框架，一种基于扩散模型的字符级引导车牌图像恢复方法，通过外部分割和OCR模块提取细粒度字符先验，使用CHARM模块确保字符引导仅作用于各自区域，显著提升恢复质量和识别精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 车牌图像恢复不仅对LPR系统预处理很重要，还能提高证据价值、增强视觉界面清晰度、促进车牌图像的进一步利用。需要解决在真实条件下捕获的严重退化车牌图像的恢复问题。

Method: CharDiff框架：1）使用外部分割和OCR模块提取字符级先验；2）引入CHARM模块，通过区域掩码确保字符引导仅作用于对应区域；3）基于扩散模型进行图像恢复。

Result: 在Roboflow-LP数据集上显著优于基线恢复模型，在恢复质量和识别准确率方面都有提升，相比最佳基线模型实现了28%的相对CER降低。

Conclusion: 结构化字符引导条件化有效增强了基于扩散模型的车牌恢复和识别在实际部署场景中的鲁棒性。

Abstract: The significance of license plate image restoration goes beyond the
preprocessing stage of License Plate Recognition (LPR) systems, as it also
serves various purposes, including increasing evidential value, enhancing the
clarity of visual interface, and facilitating further utilization of license
plate images. We propose a novel diffusion-based framework with character-level
guidance, CharDiff, which effectively restores and recognizes severely degraded
license plate images captured under realistic conditions. CharDiff leverages
fine-grained character-level priors extracted through external segmentation and
Optical Character Recognition (OCR) modules tailored for low-quality license
plate images. For precise and focused guidance, CharDiff incorporates a novel
Character-guided Attention through Region-wise Masking (CHARM) module, which
ensures that each character's guidance is restricted to its own region, thereby
avoiding interference with other regions. In experiments, CharDiff
significantly outperformed the baseline restoration models in both restoration
quality and recognition accuracy, achieving a 28% relative reduction in CER on
the Roboflow-LP dataset, compared to the best-performing baseline model. These
results indicate that the structured character-guided conditioning effectively
enhances the robustness of diffusion-based license plate restoration and
recognition in practical deployment scenarios.

Conclusion: iDETEX模型在提供准确和可解释的质量评估方面表现出有效性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Image Quality Assessment (IQA) has progressed from scalar quality prediction
to more interpretable, human-aligned evaluation paradigms. In this work, we
address the emerging challenge of detailed and explainable IQA by proposing
iDETEX-a unified multimodal large language model (MLLM) capable of
simultaneously performing three key tasks: quality grounding, perception, and
description. To facilitate efficient and generalizable training across these
heterogeneous subtasks, we design a suite of task-specific offline augmentation
modules and a data mixing strategy. These are further complemented by online
enhancement strategies to fully exploit multi-sourced supervision. We validate
our approach on the large-scale ViDA-UGC benchmark, where iDETEX achieves
state-of-the-art performance across all subtasks. Our model ranks first in the
ICCV MIPI 2025 Detailed Image Quality Assessment Challenge, demonstrating its
effectiveness and robustness in delivering accurate and interpretable quality
assessments.

*Jiahao Huo,Mufhumudzi Muthivhi,Terence L. van Zyl,Fredrik Gustafsson*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种后处理开放集识别方法，通过比较模型特征与预测logits之间的一致性来识别未知类，无需重新训练预训练模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前野生动物分类模型在封闭世界设定下训练，遇到未知类别时仍会过度自信预测。现有OSR方法大多需要重新训练模型，这限制了实用性。

Method: 基于输入到最近类均值的距离构建概率分布，然后将该分布与softmax概率进行比较，衡量NCM与分类头之间的一致性。

Result: 在两个数据集上均排名前三，AUROC分别达到93.41（非洲动物）和95.35（瑞典动物），性能稳定优于当前仅在单个数据集表现优异的方法。

Conclusion: 提出的后处理OSR方法有效解决了已知类分类和未知类拒绝问题，无需模型重训练，在多个数据集上表现一致且优秀。

Abstract: Current state-of-the-art Wildlife classification models are trained under the
closed world setting. When exposed to unknown classes, they remain
overconfident in their predictions. Open-set Recognition (OSR) aims to classify
known classes while rejecting unknown samples. Several OSR methods have been
proposed to model the closed-set distribution by observing the feature, logit,
or softmax probability space. A significant drawback of many existing
approaches is the requirement to retrain the pre-trained classification model
with the OSR-specific strategy. This study contributes a post-processing OSR
method that measures the agreement between the models' features and predicted
logits. We propose a probability distribution based on an input's distance to
its Nearest Class Mean (NCM). The NCM-based distribution is then compared with
the softmax probabilities from the logit space to measure agreement between the
NCM and the classification head. Our proposed strategy ranks within the top
three on two evaluated datasets, showing consistent performance across the two
datasets. In contrast, current state-of-the-art methods excel on a single
dataset. We achieve an AUROC of 93.41 and 95.35 for African and Swedish
animals. The code can be found

### [139] [Exploring The Missing Semantics In Event Modality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17347)
*Jingqian Wu,Shengpeng Xu,Yunbo Jia,Edmund Y. Lam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Semantic-E2VID框架，通过跨模态特征对齐和语义感知特征融合，将视觉语义知识从图像模态迁移到事件模态，显著提升了事件到视频重建的质量和语义信息恢复能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 事件相机虽然具有低延迟、高动态范围等优势，但仅捕获强度变化，忽略了静态物体和背景，导致事件模态缺乏语义信息。现有的事件到视频重建方法往往忽视了语义信息的重要性。

Method: 1. 跨模态特征对齐模块将SAM模型的视觉语义知识迁移到事件编码器；2. 语义感知特征融合块整合学习到的语义特征；3. 语义感知E2V监督利用SAM生成的类别标签帮助重建语义细节。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，Semantic-E2VID显著提升了帧质量，优于最先进的E2V方法。

Conclusion: 通过引入视觉语义知识，Semantic-E2VID有效解决了事件模态中语义信息缺失的问题，为事件到视频重建任务提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Event cameras offer distinct advantages such as low latency, high dynamic
range, and efficient motion capture. However, event-to-video reconstruction
(E2V), a fundamental event-based vision task, remains challenging, particularly
for reconstructing and recovering semantic information. This is primarily due
to the nature of the event camera, as it only captures intensity changes,
ignoring static objects and backgrounds, resulting in a lack of semantic
information in captured event modality. Further, semantic information plays a
crucial role in video and frame reconstruction, yet is often overlooked by
existing E2V approaches. To bridge this gap, we propose Semantic-E2VID, an E2V
framework that explores the missing visual semantic knowledge in event modality
and leverages it to enhance event-to-video reconstruction. Specifically,
Semantic-E2VID introduces a cross-modal feature alignment (CFA) module to
transfer the robust visual semantics from a frame-based vision foundation
model, the Segment Anything Model (SAM), to the event encoder, while aligning
the high-level features from distinct modalities. To better utilize the learned
semantic feature, we further propose a semantic-aware feature fusion (SFF)
block to integrate learned semantics in frame modality to form event
representations with rich semantics that can be decoded by the event decoder.
Further, to facilitate the reconstruction of semantic information, we propose a
novel Semantic Perceptual E2V Supervision that helps the model to reconstruct
semantic details by leveraging SAM-generated categorical labels. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that Semantic-E2VID significantly enhances frame
quality, outperforming state-of-the-art E2V methods across multiple benchmarks.
The sample code is included in the supplementary material.

*Vaggelis Dorovatas,Soroush Seifi,Gunshi Gupta,Rahaf Aljundi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种无需训练的方法，使标准视频大语言模型能够处理流式长视频，通过注意力机制选择重要视觉标记、循环处理历史标记和基于字幕的问答，在保持性能的同时大幅提升效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频大语言模型需要完整访问视频才能回答问题，无法适应流式场景下对小时级长视频的实时处理需求。

Method: 1) 基于LLM注意力选择重要视觉标记，可丢弃约95%不重要标记；2) 循环处理历史选定标记以保持时序连贯性；3) 基于字幕的轻量级问答机制。

Result: 在流式视频基准测试中达到最先进性能，在效率和效果之间取得良好平衡。

Conclusion: 该方法无需额外训练，与标准Video-LLMs兼容，成功解决了流式长视频处理的挑战，实现了高效实时的视频理解。

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) excel at understanding videos
in-context, provided they have full access to the video when answering queries.
However, these models face challenges in streaming scenarios where hour-long
videos must be processed online, and questions need timely responses. In this
work, we propose a training-free approach compatible with standard Video-LLMs,
leveraging three key concepts: 1) LLM-informed selection of visual tokens to
identify those that the LLM has attended to and contributed to its
understanding of each short clip. Our attention-based selection allows us to
discard up to ~95% of unimportant visual tokens with minimal performance loss;
2) Recurrent processing of past selected tokens to generate temporally coherent
understanding of each processed clip; 3) Caption-based question answering for
lightweight and accurate responses. Our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance on streaming video benchmarks, striking a balance between
efficiency and effectiveness.

Motivation: 解决人脸识别系统面临的伦理困境：高精度需要大量未经同意的真实人脸数据，导致数据集撤回和法律风险。合成数据作为隐私保护替代方案缺乏实证证据。

Method: 系统文献回顾识别25个合成人脸识别数据集，通过实验验证七个关键要求：身份泄露预防、类内变异性、身份可分离性、数据集规模、伦理数据来源、偏见缓解和基准可靠性。

Result: 最佳合成数据集VariFace和VIGFace分别达到95.67%和94.91%的识别准确率，超越CASIA-WebFace(94.70%)。合成数据能确保适当的类内变异性并保持身份可分离性，同时提供前所未有的偏见控制能力。

Conclusion: 合成人脸数据是科学可行且伦理必要的面部识别研究替代方案，能够解决隐私问题并提供偏见缓解控制。

Abstract: The deployment of facial recognition systems has created an ethical dilemma:
achieving high accuracy requires massive datasets of real faces collected
without consent, leading to dataset retractions and potential legal liabilities
under regulations like GDPR. While synthetic facial data presents a promising
privacy-preserving alternative, the field lacks comprehensive empirical
evidence of its viability. This study addresses this critical gap through
extensive evaluation of synthetic facial recognition datasets. We present a
systematic literature review identifying 25 synthetic facial recognition
datasets (2018-2025), combined with rigorous experimental validation. Our
methodology examines seven key requirements for privacy-preserving synthetic
data: identity leakage prevention, intra-class variability, identity
separability, dataset scale, ethical data sourcing, bias mitigation, and
benchmark reliability. Through experiments involving over 10 million synthetic
samples, extended by a comparison of results reported on five standard
benchmarks, we provide the first comprehensive empirical assessment of
synthetic data's capability to replace real datasets. Best-performing synthetic
datasets (VariFace, VIGFace) achieve recognition accuracies of 95.67% and
94.91% respectively, surpassing established real datasets including
CASIA-WebFace (94.70%). While those images remain private, publicly available
alternatives Vec2Face (93.52%) and CemiFace (93.22%) come close behind. Our
findings reveal that they ensure proper intra-class variability while
maintaining identity separability. Demographic bias analysis shows that, even
though synthetic data inherits limited biases, it offers unprecedented control
for bias mitigation through generation parameters. These results establish
synthetic facial data as a scientifically viable and ethically imperative
alternative for facial recognition research.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于多面部表情特征融合的帕金森病严重程度诊断方法，通过注意力机制融合多种表情特征，并采用自适应类别平衡策略解决类别不平衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于面部表情的PD诊断方法依赖单一表情类型易导致误诊，且忽视不同PD阶段的类别不平衡问题，大多数方法仅进行二元分类而非严重程度诊断。

Method: 通过注意力机制融合多种面部表情特征，并采用自适应类别平衡策略动态调整训练样本的贡献度。

Result: 实验结果表明该方法在PD严重程度诊断方面表现优异，注意力特征融合和自适应类别平衡策略均有效。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效诊断PD严重程度，多表情特征融合和类别平衡策略显著提升了诊断性能。

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) severity diagnosis is crucial for early detecting
potential patients and adopting tailored interventions. Diagnosing PD based on
facial expression is grounded in PD patients' "masked face" symptom and gains
growing interest recently for its convenience and affordability. However,
current facial expression-based approaches often rely on single type of
expression which can lead to misdiagnosis, and ignore the class imbalance
across different PD stages which degrades the prediction performance. Moreover,
most existing methods focus on binary classification (i.e., PD / non-PD) rather
than diagnosing the severity of PD. To address these issues, we propose a new
facial expression-based method for PD severity diagnosis which integrates
multiple facial expression features through attention-based feature fusion.
Moreover, we mitigate the class imbalance problem via an adaptive class
balancing strategy which dynamically adjusts the contribution of training
samples based on their class distribution and classification difficulty.
Experimental results demonstrate the promising performance of the proposed
method for PD severity diagnosis, as well as the efficacy of attention-based
feature fusion and adaptive class balancing.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LoopTrans是一个闭环框架，通过双向知识转移在自我中心和外中心视角间传递交互知识，解决了传统单向知识转移的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类通过观察他人与物体的交互就能学会新的交互方式。现有弱监督交互定位方法仅从外中心图像单向转移到自我中心图像，限制了在复杂交互场景中的应用。

Method: 提出闭环框架LoopTrans，包含统一跨模态定位和去噪知识蒸馏机制，实现自我中心和外中心视角间的双向知识转移。

Result: 在图像和视频基准测试中各项指标均取得一致提升，即使在交互区域被人体完全遮挡的挑战性场景下也能有效处理。

Conclusion: LoopTrans通过双向知识转移有效提升了交互定位性能，证明了闭环框架在跨视角知识传递中的优势。

Abstract: Humans can perform previously unexperienced interactions with novel objects
simply by observing others engage with them. Weakly-supervised affordance
grounding mimics this process by learning to locate object regions that enable
actions on egocentric images, using exocentric interaction images with
image-level annotations. However, extracting affordance knowledge solely from
exocentric images and transferring it one-way to egocentric images limits the
applicability of previous works in complex interaction scenarios. Instead, this
study introduces LoopTrans, a novel closed-loop framework that not only
transfers knowledge from exocentric to egocentric but also transfers back to
enhance exocentric knowledge extraction. Within LoopTrans, several innovative
mechanisms are introduced, including unified cross-modal localization and
denoising knowledge distillation, to bridge domain gaps between object-centered
egocentric and interaction-centered exocentric images while enhancing knowledge
transfer. Experiments show that LoopTrans achieves consistent improvements
across all metrics on image and video benchmarks, even handling challenging
scenarios where object interaction regions are fully occluded by the human
body.

Motivation: 传统马匹行为监测方法劳动密集且耗时，需要自动化解决方案来早期发现健康福利问题。

Method: 结合目标检测和多目标跟踪技术，利用CLIP和GroundingDINO构建自定义数据集，基于对象轨迹和空间关系推断事件状态。

Result: 定性评估显示马匹相关事件检测可靠，但人员检测因数据稀缺存在局限性，系统考虑了摄像头盲区。

Conclusion: 为马术设施实时行为监测奠定了基础，对动物福利和厩舍管理具有重要意义。

Abstract: Monitoring the behavior of stalled horses is essential for early detection of
health and welfare issues but remains labor-intensive and time-consuming. In
this study, we present a prototype vision-based monitoring system that
automates the detection and tracking of horses and people inside stables using
object detection and multi-object tracking techniques. The system leverages
YOLOv11 and BoT-SORT for detection and tracking, while event states are
inferred based on object trajectories and spatial relations within the stall.
To support development, we constructed a custom dataset annotated with
assistance from foundation models CLIP and GroundingDINO. The system
distinguishes between five event types and accounts for the camera's blind
spots. Qualitative evaluation demonstrated reliable performance for
horse-related events, while highlighting limitations in detecting people due to
data scarcity. This work provides a foundation for real-time behavioral
monitoring in equine facilities, with implications for animal welfare and
stable management.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeepDetect是一个智能的密集关键点检测器，通过融合传统检测器和边缘检测器的输出创建真实标签，训练轻量级ESPNet模型，在关键点密度、重复性和正确匹配数量方面超越现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统关键点检测器（SIFT、SURF等）和基于学习的方法（SuperPoint等）存在对光度变化敏感、关键点密度低、重复性差、对挑战性场景适应性有限以及缺乏语义理解等问题，无法优先处理视觉重要区域。

Method: 首先融合7种关键点检测器和2种边缘检测器的输出创建真实标签掩码，提取从角点到边缘和纹理的多样化视觉线索。然后使用这些掩码作为标签训练轻量高效的ESPNet模型。

Result: 在Oxford Affine Covariant Regions数据集上的评估显示，DeepDetect在关键点密度（0.5143）、重复性（0.9582）和正确匹配数量（59,003）方面均达到最大值，超越了其他检测器。

Conclusion: DeepDetect成功统一了经典检测器的优势，通过深度学习实现了语义感知的密集关键点检测，能够适应多样化和视觉退化条件，在各种计算机视觉任务中具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: Keypoint detection is the foundation of many computer vision tasks, including
image registration, structure-from motion, 3D reconstruction, visual odometry,
and SLAM. Traditional detectors (SIFT, SURF, ORB, BRISK, etc.) and learning
based methods (SuperPoint, R2D2, LF-Net, D2-Net, etc.) have shown strong
performance yet suffer from key limitations: sensitivity to photometric
changes, low keypoint density and repeatability, limited adaptability to
challenging scenes, and lack of semantic understanding, often failing to
prioritize visually important regions. We present DeepDetect, an intelligent,
all-in-one, dense keypoint detector that unifies the strengths of classical
detectors using deep learning. Firstly, we create ground-truth masks by fusing
outputs of 7 keypoint and 2 edge detectors, extracting diverse visual cues from
corners and blobs to prominent edges and textures in the images. Afterwards, a
lightweight and efficient model: ESPNet, is trained using these masks as
labels, enabling DeepDetect to focus semantically on images while producing
highly dense keypoints, that are adaptable to diverse and visually degraded
conditions. Evaluations on the Oxford Affine Covariant Regions dataset
demonstrate that DeepDetect surpasses other detectors in keypoint density,
repeatability, and the number of correct matches, achieving maximum values of
0.5143 (average keypoint density), 0.9582 (average repeatability), and 59,003
(correct matches).

Result: 在117帧视频上成功注册所有图像，重建46-62万个点，重投影误差0.51-0.53像素，匹配密度与BA时间成正比。

Conclusion: 压缩域对应关系是一种实用且资源高效的前端方法，具有在完整流程中扩展的明确路径。

Abstract: We repurpose AV1 motion vectors to produce dense sub-pixel correspondences
and short tracks filtered by cosine consistency. On short videos, this
compressed-domain front end runs comparably to sequential SIFT while using far
less CPU, and yields denser matches with competitive pairwise geometry. As a
small SfM demo on a 117-frame clip, MV matches register all images and
reconstruct 0.46-0.62M points at 0.51-0.53,px reprojection error; BA time grows
with match density. These results show compressed-domain correspondences are a
practical, resource-efficient front end with clear paths to scaling in full
pipelines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个高质量的夜间图像去雨基准数据集HQ-NightRain，并开发了颜色空间转换网络CST-Net，通过可学习的颜色空间转换器和隐式光照引导来有效去除夜间复杂雨纹。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 夜间图像去雨比白天更具挑战性，主要由于夜间场景的固有复杂性以及缺乏准确表征雨与光照耦合效应的高质量数据集。

Method: 提出CST-Net网络，包含可学习的颜色空间转换器(CSC)在Y通道更好地去除雨纹，并引入隐式光照引导来提高模型在复杂场景中的鲁棒性。

Result: 大量实验验证了所提数据集的价值和方法的有效性，在夜间图像去雨任务上表现出色。

Conclusion: HQ-NightRain数据集和CST-Net方法为夜间图像去雨任务提供了高质量的基准和有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Compared to daytime image deraining, nighttime image deraining poses
significant challenges due to inherent complexities of nighttime scenarios and
the lack of high-quality datasets that accurately represent the coupling effect
between rain and illumination. In this paper, we rethink the task of nighttime
image deraining and contribute a new high-quality benchmark, HQ-NightRain,
which offers higher harmony and realism compared to existing datasets. In
addition, we develop an effective Color Space Transformation Network (CST-Net)
for better removing complex rain from nighttime scenes. Specifically, we
propose a learnable color space converter (CSC) to better facilitate rain
removal in the Y channel, as nighttime rain is more pronounced in the Y channel
compared to the RGB color space. To capture illumination information for
guiding nighttime deraining, implicit illumination guidance is introduced
enabling the learned features to improve the model's robustness in complex
scenarios. Extensive experiments show the value of our dataset and the
effectiveness of our method. The source code and datasets are available at

*Feng Zhou,Wenkai Guo,Pu Cao,Zhicheng Zhang,Jianqin Yin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种改进稀疏视图3D高斯溅射(3DGS)初始化的方法，通过频率感知SfM、3DGS自初始化和点云正则化来解决稀疏视图下的过拟合问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏视图3DGS容易对训练视图过拟合，导致新视角渲染出现模糊等伪影。现有方法要么改进初始化，要么添加训练时约束，但实验表明初始化是决定性因素。

Method: 1) 频率感知SfM：通过低频视图增强和宽松多视图对应改进低纹理区域覆盖；2) 3DGS自初始化：利用光度监督生成额外点云；3) 点云正则化：通过几何/可见性先验确保多视图一致性和均匀空间覆盖。

Result: 在LLFF和Mip-NeRF360数据集上的实验表明，该方法在稀疏视图设置下取得了持续的性能提升。

Conclusion: 该方法作为一种更强的初始化策略，有效解决了稀疏视图3DGS的过拟合问题。

Abstract: Sparse-view 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) often overfits to the training
views, leading to artifacts like blurring in novel view rendering. Prior work
addresses it either by enhancing the initialization (\emph{i.e.}, the point
cloud from Structure-from-Motion (SfM)) or by adding training-time constraints
(regularization) to the 3DGS optimization. Yet our controlled ablations reveal
that initialization is the decisive factor: it determines the attainable
performance band in sparse-view 3DGS, while training-time constraints yield
only modest within-band improvements at extra cost. Given initialization's
primacy, we focus our design there. Although SfM performs poorly under sparse
views due to its reliance on feature matching, it still provides reliable seed
points. Thus, building on SfM, our effort aims to supplement the regions it
fails to cover as comprehensively as possible. Specifically, we design: (i)
frequency-aware SfM that improves low-texture coverage via low-frequency view
augmentation and relaxed multi-view correspondences; (ii) 3DGS
self-initialization that lifts photometric supervision into additional points,
compensating SfM-sparse regions with learned Gaussian centers; and (iii)
point-cloud regularization that enforces multi-view consistency and uniform
spatial coverage through simple geometric/visibility priors, yielding a clean
and reliable point cloud. Our experiments on LLFF and Mip-NeRF360 demonstrate
consistent gains in sparse-view settings, establishing our approach as a
stronger initialization strategy. Code is available at

TL;DR: SparseWorld是一个新颖的4D占用世界模型，使用稀疏动态查询实现灵活、自适应和高效的场景感知与预测，在感知、预测和规划任务中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有占用世界模型依赖静态固定嵌入或网格，限制了感知灵活性，且基于网格的"原位分类"与真实场景的动态连续性存在潜在不匹配。

Method: 提出Range-Adaptive Perception模块（通过车辆状态调制可学习查询并增强时空关联）和State-Conditioned Forecasting模块（用回归引导公式替代基于分类的预测），并设计Temporal-Aware Self-Scheduling训练策略。

Result: 在感知、预测和规划任务中实现最先进性能，验证了模型在灵活性、适应性和效率方面的优势。

Conclusion: SparseWorld通过稀疏动态查询有效解决了现有占用世界模型的局限性，为4D环境建模提供了更灵活、自适应和高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Semantic occupancy has emerged as a powerful representation in world models
for its ability to capture rich spatial semantics. However, most existing
occupancy world models rely on static and fixed embeddings or grids, which
inherently limit the flexibility of perception. Moreover, their ``in-place
classification" over grids exhibits a potential misalignment with the dynamic
and continuous nature of real scenarios.In this paper, we propose SparseWorld,
a novel 4D occupancy world model that is flexible, adaptive, and efficient,
powered by sparse and dynamic queries. We propose a Range-Adaptive Perception
module, in which learnable queries are modulated by the ego vehicle states and
enriched with temporal-spatial associations to enable extended-range
perception. To effectively capture the dynamics of the scene, we design a
State-Conditioned Forecasting module, which replaces classification-based
forecasting with regression-guided formulation, precisely aligning the dynamic
queries with the continuity of the 4D environment. In addition, We specifically
devise a Temporal-Aware Self-Scheduling training strategy to enable smooth and
efficient training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SparseWorld achieves
state-of-the-art performance across perception, forecasting, and planning
tasks. Comprehensive visualizations and ablation studies further validate the
advantages of SparseWorld in terms of flexibility, adaptability, and
efficiency. The code is available at https://github.com/MSunDYY/SparseWorld.

*Muhammad Umer Ramzan,Ali Zia,Abdelwahed Khamis,Noman Ali,Usman Ali,Wei Xiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: POTNet通过熵引导的双聚类头和最优传输技术生成高质量伪掩码，AutoSOD基于此构建端到端无监督显著目标检测流程，在多个基准测试中显著超越现有无监督和弱监督方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 显著目标检测(SOD)作为计算机视觉基础任务，作者认为无需像素级标签也能达到接近监督方法的精度，但前提是获得可靠的伪掩码。现有原型方法存在边界和内部像素几何特性差异以及最优传输全局一致性利用不足的问题。

Method: 提出POTNet，改进原型最优传输方法：1) 使用熵引导的双聚类头：高熵像素用谱聚类，低熵像素用k-means；2) 通过最优传输对齐两个原型集；3) 构建AutoSOD端到端无监督SOD流程，用生成的伪掩码监督标准MaskFormer编码器-解码器。

Result: 在五个基准测试中，AutoSOD在F-measure指标上比无监督方法提升高达26%，比弱监督方法提升高达36%，进一步缩小了与全监督模型的差距。

Conclusion: POTNet的分割-融合-传输设计能在单次前向传播中生成更清晰、部分感知的伪掩码，AutoSOD在消除SelfMask离线投票的同时提高了准确性和训练效率，证明了无监督SOD的可行性。

Abstract: Salient object detection (SOD) aims to segment visually prominent regions in
images and serves as a foundational task for various computer vision
applications. We posit that SOD can now reach near-supervised accuracy without
a single pixel-level label, but only when reliable pseudo-masks are available.
We revisit the prototype-based line of work and make two key observations.
First, boundary pixels and interior pixels obey markedly different geometry;
second, the global consistency enforced by optimal transport (OT) is
underutilized if prototype quality is weak. To address this, we introduce
POTNet, an adaptation of Prototypical Optimal Transport that replaces POT's
single k-means step with an entropy-guided dual-clustering head: high-entropy
pixels are organized by spectral clustering, low-entropy pixels by k-means, and
the two prototype sets are subsequently aligned by OT. This
split-fuse-transport design yields sharper, part-aware pseudo-masks in a single
forward pass, without handcrafted priors. Those masks supervise a standard
MaskFormer-style encoder-decoder, giving rise to AutoSOD, an end-to-end
unsupervised SOD pipeline that eliminates SelfMask's offline voting yet
improves both accuracy and training efficiency. Extensive experiments on five
benchmarks show that AutoSOD outperforms unsupervised methods by up to 26% and
weakly supervised methods by up to 36% in F-measure, further narrowing the gap
to fully supervised models.

*Yuanli Wu,Long Zhang,Yue Du,Bin Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于评分标准引导的伪标签提示框架，通过将少量真实标注转化为高置信度伪标签，构建数据集自适应的评分标准来指导可解释的场景评估，实现无需参数调整的零样本视频摘要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有监督方法标注成本高且跨数据集泛化能力有限，无监督方法难以捕捉高级语义和细粒度叙事线索，零样本提示方法对人工提示模板敏感且依赖数据集特定的分数归一化。

Method: 使用评分标准引导的伪标签提示框架，将少量真实标注转化为伪标签并聚合成结构化评分标准。推理时基于描述对首尾片段评分，中间片段结合相邻场景的上下文摘要来评估叙事进展和冗余度。

Result: 在SumMe和TVSum数据集上分别达到57.58和63.05的F1分数，超越了无监督和先前的零样本基线方法，接近监督方法的性能。

Conclusion: 评分标准引导的伪标签方法有效稳定了基于LLM的评分，为视频摘要建立了一个通用且可解释的零样本范式。

Abstract: With the rapid proliferation of video content across social media,
surveillance, and education platforms, efficiently summarizing long videos into
concise yet semantically faithful surrogates has become increasingly vital.
Existing supervised methods achieve strong in-domain accuracy by learning from
dense annotations but suffer from high labeling costs and limited cross-dataset
generalization, while unsupervised approaches, though label-free, often fail to
capture high-level human semantics and fine-grained narrative cues. More
recently, zero-shot prompting pipelines have leveraged large language models
(LLMs) for training-free video summarization, yet remain highly sensitive to
handcrafted prompt templates and dataset-specific score normalization. To
overcome these limitations, we introduce a rubric-guided, pseudo-labeled
prompting framework that transforms a small subset of ground-truth annotations
into high-confidence pseudo labels, which are aggregated into structured,
dataset-adaptive scoring rubrics guiding interpretable scene evaluation. During
inference, first and last segments are scored based solely on their
descriptions, whereas intermediate ones incorporate brief contextual summaries
of adjacent scenes to assess narrative progression and redundancy. This
contextual prompting enables the LLM to balance local salience and global
coherence without parameter tuning. On SumMe and TVSum, our method achieves F1
scores of \textbf{57.58} and \textbf{63.05}, surpassing unsupervised and prior
zero-shot baselines while approaching supervised performance. The results
demonstrate that rubric-guided pseudo labeling effectively stabilizes LLM-based
scoring and establishes a general, interpretable zero-shot paradigm for video
summarization.

Conclusion: 该框架成功解决了大规模视频生成模型训练的关键挑战，实现了高效训练和优异性能，并通过开源促进社区发展。

Abstract: In recent years, large-scale generative models for visual content
(\textit{e.g.,} images, videos, and 3D objects/scenes) have made remarkable
progress. However, training large-scale video generation models remains
particularly challenging and resource-intensive due to cross-modal text-video
alignment, the long sequences involved, and the complex spatiotemporal
dependencies. To address these challenges, we present a training framework that
optimizes four pillars: (i) data processing, (ii) model architecture, (iii)
training strategy, and (iv) infrastructure for large-scale video generation
models. These optimizations delivered significant efficiency gains and
performance improvements across all stages of data preprocessing, video
compression, parameter scaling, curriculum-based pretraining, and
alignment-focused post-training. Our resulting model, MUG-V 10B, matches recent
state-of-the-art video generators overall and, on e-commerce-oriented video
generation tasks, surpasses leading open-source baselines in human evaluations.
More importantly, we open-source the complete stack, including model weights,
Megatron-Core-based large-scale training code, and inference pipelines for
video generation and enhancement. To our knowledge, this is the first public
release of large-scale video generation training code that exploits
Megatron-Core to achieve high training efficiency and near-linear multi-node
scaling, details are available in

TL;DR: 提出MambaX-Net，一种用于前列腺癌主动监测的半监督双扫描3D分割架构，利用时间序列MRI数据改进前列腺区域分割。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习分割模型基于单时间点专家标注数据，不适合纵向主动监测分析，因为多时间点和专家标注稀缺限制了有效微调。

Method: 采用Mamba增强的交叉注意力模块捕获时间演化和长距离空间依赖，形状提取器模块编码先前分割掩码为潜在解剖表示，结合半监督自训练策略利用伪标签。

Result: 在纵向主动监测数据集上评估，MambaX-Net显著优于最先进的U-Net和Transformer模型，在有限和噪声数据下实现优越的前列腺区域分割。

Conclusion: MambaX-Net能够有效处理纵向主动监测中的多时间点MRI分割问题，在专家标注稀缺情况下仍能获得高质量分割结果。

Abstract: Active Surveillance (AS) is a treatment option for managing low and
intermediate-risk prostate cancer (PCa), aiming to avoid overtreatment while
monitoring disease progression through serial MRI and clinical follow-up.
Accurate prostate segmentation is an important preliminary step for automating
this process, enabling automated detection and diagnosis of PCa. However,
existing deep-learning segmentation models are often trained on
single-time-point and expertly annotated datasets, making them unsuitable for
longitudinal AS analysis, where multiple time points and a scarcity of expert
labels hinder their effective fine-tuning. To address these challenges, we
propose MambaX-Net, a novel semi-supervised, dual-scan 3D segmentation
architecture that computes the segmentation for time point t by leveraging the
MRI and the corresponding segmentation mask from the previous time point. We
introduce two new components: (i) a Mamba-enhanced Cross-Attention Module,
which integrates the Mamba block into cross attention to efficiently capture
temporal evolution and long-range spatial dependencies, and (ii) a Shape
Extractor Module that encodes the previous segmentation mask into a latent
anatomical representation for refined zone delination. Moreover, we introduce a
semi-supervised self-training strategy that leverages pseudo-labels generated
from a pre-trained nnU-Net, enabling effective learning without expert
annotations. MambaX-Net was evaluated on a longitudinal AS dataset, and results
showed that it significantly outperforms state-of-the-art U-Net and
Transformer-based models, achieving superior prostate zone segmentation even
when trained on limited and noisy data.

TL;DR: WP-CrackNet是一种弱监督的道路裂缝检测方法，仅使用图像级标签就能实现像素级检测，通过分类器、重构器和检测器的对抗学习以及路径感知注意力模块来提高检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了减少对昂贵像素级标注的依赖，开发一种仅需图像级标签的弱监督道路裂缝检测方法，以支持智能城市基础设施维护。

Method: 提出WP-CrackNet框架，包含三个组件：生成类激活图的分类器、测量特征可推断性的重构器、生成像素级检测结果的检测器。通过对抗学习和路径感知注意力模块(PAAM)融合高层语义和低层结构线索，使用中心增强CAM一致性模块(CECCM)优化伪标签生成。

Result: 在三个自建图像级数据集上的实验表明，WP-CrackNet达到了与监督方法相当的结果，并优于现有的弱监督方法。

Conclusion: WP-CrackNet显著推进了可扩展的道路检测，在减少标注成本的同时保持了高检测精度。

Abstract: Road crack detection is essential for intelligent infrastructure maintenance
in smart cities. To reduce reliance on costly pixel-level annotations, we
propose WP-CrackNet, an end-to-end weakly-supervised method that trains with
only image-level labels for pixel-wise crack detection. WP-CrackNet integrates
three components: a classifier generating class activation maps (CAMs), a
reconstructor measuring feature inferability, and a detector producing
pixel-wise road crack detection results. During training, the classifier and
reconstructor alternate in adversarial learning to encourage crack CAMs to
cover complete crack regions, while the detector learns from pseudo labels
derived from post-processed crack CAMs. This mutual feedback among the three
components improves learning stability and detection accuracy. To further boost
detection performance, we design a path-aware attention module (PAAM) that
fuses high-level semantics from the classifier with low-level structural cues
from the reconstructor by modeling spatial and channel-wise dependencies.
Additionally, a center-enhanced CAM consistency module (CECCM) is proposed to
refine crack CAMs using center Gaussian weighting and consistency constraints,
enabling better pseudo-label generation. We create three image-level datasets
and extensive experiments show that WP-CrackNet achieves comparable results to
supervised methods and outperforms existing weakly-supervised methods,
significantly advancing scalable road inspection. The source code package and
datasets are available at https://mias.group/WP-CrackNet/.

TL;DR: PAGE-4D是一个扩展VGGT的前馈模型，专门针对动态场景，能够同时进行相机姿态估计、深度预测和点云重建，无需后处理。


<details>

Motivation: 现有的3D前馈模型在静态数据集上训练，难以处理包含动态元素（如移动人物或可变形物体）的真实世界场景。

Method: 提出动态感知聚合器，通过预测动态感知掩码来分离静态和动态信息——抑制运动线索用于姿态估计，同时增强它们用于几何重建。

Result: 在动态场景中，PAGE-4D持续优于原始VGGT，在相机姿态估计、单目和视频深度估计以及密集点图重建方面取得更优结果。

Conclusion: PAGE-4D成功解决了4D重建中多任务间的固有冲突，为动态场景的3D属性推断提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent 3D feed-forward models, such as the Visual Geometry Grounded
Transformer (VGGT), have shown strong capability in inferring 3D attributes of
static scenes. However, since they are typically trained on static datasets,
these models often struggle in real-world scenarios involving complex dynamic
elements, such as moving humans or deformable objects like umbrellas. To
address this limitation, we introduce PAGE-4D, a feedforward model that extends
VGGT to dynamic scenes, enabling camera pose estimation, depth prediction, and
point cloud reconstruction -- all without post-processing. A central challenge
in multi-task 4D reconstruction is the inherent conflict between tasks:
accurate camera pose estimation requires suppressing dynamic regions, while
geometry reconstruction requires modeling them. To resolve this tension, we
propose a dynamics-aware aggregator that disentangles static and dynamic
information by predicting a dynamics-aware mask -- suppressing motion cues for
pose estimation while amplifying them for geometry reconstruction. Extensive
experiments show that PAGE-4D consistently outperforms the original VGGT in
dynamic scenarios, achieving superior results in camera pose estimation,
monocular and video depth estimation, and dense point map reconstruction.

Abstract: With the development of underwater exploration and marine protection,
underwater vision tasks are widespread. Due to the degraded underwater
environment, characterized by color distortion, low contrast, and blurring,
camouflaged instance segmentation (CIS) faces greater challenges in accurately
segmenting objects that blend closely with their surroundings. Traditional
camouflaged instance segmentation methods, trained on terrestrial-dominated
datasets with limited underwater samples, may exhibit inadequate performance in
underwater scenes. To address these issues, we introduce the first underwater
camouflaged instance segmentation (UCIS) dataset, abbreviated as UCIS4K, which
comprises 3,953 images of camouflaged marine organisms with instance-level
annotations. In addition, we propose an Underwater Camouflaged Instance
Segmentation network based on Segment Anything Model (UCIS-SAM). Our UCIS-SAM
includes three key modules. First, the Channel Balance Optimization Module
(CBOM) enhances channel characteristics to improve underwater feature learning,
effectively addressing the model's limited understanding of underwater
environments. Second, the Frequency Domain True Integration Module (FDTIM) is
proposed to emphasize intrinsic object features and reduce interference from
camouflage patterns, enhancing the segmentation performance of camouflaged
objects blending with their surroundings. Finally, the Multi-scale Feature
Frequency Aggregation Module (MFFAM) is designed to strengthen the boundaries
of low-contrast camouflaged instances across multiple frequency bands,
improving the model's ability to achieve more precise segmentation of
camouflaged objects. Extensive experiments on the proposed UCIS4K and public
benchmarks show that our UCIS-SAM outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: 3D generation from natural language offers significant potential to reduce
expert manual modeling efforts and enhance accessibility to 3D assets. However,
existing methods often yield unstructured meshes and exhibit poor
interactivity, making them impractical for artistic workflows. To address these
limitations, we represent 3D assets as shape programs and introduce ShapeCraft,
a novel multi-agent framework for text-to-3D generation. At its core, we
propose a Graph-based Procedural Shape (GPS) representation that decomposes
complex natural language into a structured graph of sub-tasks, thereby
facilitating accurate LLM comprehension and interpretation of spatial
relationships and semantic shape details. Specifically, LLM agents
hierarchically parse user input to initialize GPS, then iteratively refine
procedural modeling and painting to produce structured, textured, and
interactive 3D assets. Qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate
ShapeCraft's superior performance in generating geometrically accurate and
semantically rich 3D assets compared to existing LLM-based agents. We further
show the versatility of ShapeCraft through examples of animated and
user-customized editing, highlighting its potential for broader interactive
applications.

Abstract: The advancement of UAV technology has enabled efficient, non-contact
structural health monitoring. Combined with photogrammetry, UAVs can capture
high-resolution scans and reconstruct detailed 3D models of infrastructure.
However, a key challenge remains in segmenting specific structural components
from these models-a process traditionally reliant on time-consuming and
error-prone manual labeling. To address this issue, we propose a machine
learning-based framework for automated segmentation of 3D point clouds. Our
approach uses the complementary strengths of real-world UAV-scanned point
clouds and synthetic data generated from Building Information Modeling (BIM) to
overcome the limitations associated with manual labeling. Validation on a
railroad track dataset demonstrated high accuracy in identifying and segmenting
major components such as rails and crossties. Moreover, by using smaller-scale
datasets supplemented with BIM data, the framework significantly reduced
training time while maintaining reasonable segmentation accuracy. This
automated approach improves the precision and efficiency of 3D infrastructure
model segmentation and advances the integration of UAV and BIM technologies in
structural health monitoring and infrastructure management.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Dinomaly2是一个统一的无监督异常检测框架，通过五个简单元素的协调在标准重建框架中实现卓越性能，填补了多类模型性能差距，并扩展到多种数据模态和任务设置。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多类异常检测模型性能显著落后于单类模型，且该领域已分裂为针对特定场景的专门方法，需要统一的解决方案。

Method: 采用"少即是多"理念，在标准重建框架中协调五个简单元素，无需修改即可自然扩展到多样化任务。

Result: 在12个UAD基准测试中表现优异：多类模型在MVTec-AD和VisA上分别达到99.9%和99.3% I-AUROC；仅用每类8个正常样本就超越先前全样本模型；在多视图和多模态检测中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: Dinomaly2通过极简设计、计算可扩展性和通用适用性，成为现实世界异常检测应用的统一解决方案。

Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) has evolved from building specialized
single-class models to unified multi-class models, yet existing multi-class
models significantly underperform the most advanced one-for-one counterparts.
Moreover, the field has fragmented into specialized methods tailored to
specific scenarios (multi-class, 3D, few-shot, etc.), creating deployment
barriers and highlighting the need for a unified solution. In this paper, we
present Dinomaly2, the first unified framework for full-spectrum image UAD,
which bridges the performance gap in multi-class models while seamlessly
extending across diverse data modalities and task settings. Guided by the "less
is more" philosophy, we demonstrate that the orchestration of five simple
element achieves superior performance in a standard reconstruction-based
framework. This methodological minimalism enables natural extension across
diverse tasks without modification, establishing that simplicity is the
foundation of true universality. Extensive experiments on 12 UAD benchmarks
demonstrate Dinomaly2's full-spectrum superiority across multiple modalities
(2D, multi-view, RGB-3D, RGB-IR), task settings (single-class, multi-class,
inference-unified multi-class, few-shot) and application domains (industrial,
biological, outdoor). For example, our multi-class model achieves unprecedented
99.9% and 99.3% image-level (I-) AUROC on MVTec-AD and VisA respectively. For
multi-view and multi-modal inspection, Dinomaly2 demonstrates state-of-the-art
performance with minimum adaptations. Moreover, using only 8 normal examples
per class, our method surpasses previous full-shot models, achieving 98.7% and
97.4% I-AUROC on MVTec-AD and VisA. The combination of minimalistic design,
computational scalability, and universal applicability positions Dinomaly2 as a
unified solution for the full spectrum of real-world anomaly detection
applications.

*Frédéric LIN,Biruk Abere Ambaw,Adrian Popescu,Hejer Ammar,Romaric Audigier,Hervé Le Borgne*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CaMiT数据集包含787K标注样本和5.1M未标注样本，涵盖190种车型(2007-2023)，用于研究视觉系统的时序适应能力。研究发现静态预训练在跨年测试时性能下降，提出时间增量分类设置和两种策略来提升时序鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI系统需要适应不断变化的视觉环境，特别是在对象外观随时间演变的领域。汽车模型作为技术制品的代表类别，其外观随时间变化明显，需要研究如何使视觉系统适应这种时序演变。

Method: 1) 构建CaMiT数据集；2) 评估静态预训练方法；3) 提出时间增量分类设置；4) 探索两种时序适应策略：时间增量预训练(更新主干网络)和时间增量分类器学习(仅更新最后一层)；5) 研究时间感知图像生成方法。

Result: 静态预训练在领域内数据上能达到与大规模通用模型竞争的性能且更高效，但在跨年测试时准确率下降。时间增量预训练和时间增量分类器学习都能改善时序鲁棒性。时间感知图像生成能产生更真实的输出。

Conclusion: CaMiT为研究细粒度视觉识别和生成中的时序适应提供了丰富的基准，时间增量学习策略能有效提升模型对时序变化的鲁棒性。

Abstract: AI systems must adapt to evolving visual environments, especially in domains
where object appearances change over time. We introduce Car Models in Time
(CaMiT), a fine-grained dataset capturing the temporal evolution of car models,
a representative class of technological artifacts. CaMiT includes 787K labeled
samples of 190 car models (2007-2023) and 5.1M unlabeled samples (2005-2023),
supporting both supervised and self-supervised learning. Static pretraining on
in-domain data achieves competitive performance with large-scale generalist
models while being more resource-efficient, yet accuracy declines when models
are tested across years. To address this, we propose a time-incremental
classification setting, a realistic continual learning scenario with emerging,
evolving, and disappearing classes. We evaluate two strategies:
time-incremental pretraining, which updates the backbone, and time-incremental
classifier learning, which updates only the final layer, both improving
temporal robustness. Finally, we explore time-aware image generation that
leverages temporal metadata during training, yielding more realistic outputs.
CaMiT offers a rich benchmark for studying temporal adaptation in fine-grained
visual recognition and generation.

*Zexian Huang,Mashnoon Islam,Brian Armstrong,Kourosh Khoshelham,Martin Tomko*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出DINO-CV框架，利用高分辨率LiDAR DEM和自监督跨视图预训练策略，自动映射植被覆盖下的干石墙，解决了视觉遮挡和标注数据稀缺的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 干石墙具有重要的遗产和环境价值，但在澳大利亚的生态系统保护和野火管理中，许多干石墙因难以接近和人工测绘成本高而未被识别。深度学习方法面临视觉遮挡和标注数据有限的挑战。

Method: 使用高分辨率机载LiDAR DEM克服植被遮挡，提出基于知识蒸馏的自监督跨视图预训练策略，学习多个DEM衍生产品的不变视觉和几何表示，支持多种视觉骨干网络。

Result: 在Budj Bim UNESCO世界遗产文化景观中，该方法识别了澳大利亚最密集的殖民时期干石墙集合。测试区域mIoU达到68.6%，仅使用10%标注数据微调后仍保持63.8% mIoU。

Conclusion: 自监督学习结合高分辨率DEM衍生产品，在植被覆盖和遗产丰富但标注稀缺的环境中，展示了自动干石墙映射的潜力。

Abstract: Dry-stone walls hold significant heritage and environmental value. Mapping
these structures is essential for ecosystem preservation and wildfire
management in Australia. Yet, many walls remain unidentified due to their
inaccessibility and the high cost of manual mapping. Deep learning-based
segmentation offers a scalable solution, but two major challenges persist: (1)
visual occlusion of low-lying walls by dense vegetation, and (2) limited
labeled data for supervised training. We propose DINO-CV, a segmentation
framework for automatic mapping of low-lying dry-stone walls using
high-resolution Airborne LiDAR-derived digital elevation models (DEMs). DEMs
overcome visual occlusion by capturing terrain structures hidden beneath
vegetation, enabling analysis of structural rather than spectral cues. DINO-CV
introduces a self-supervised cross-view pre-training strategy based on
knowledge distillation to mitigate data scarcity. It learns invariant visual
and geometric representations across multiple DEM derivatives, supporting
various vision backbones including ResNet, Wide ResNet, and Vision
Transformers. Applied to the UNESCO World Heritage cultural landscape of Budj
Bim, Victoria, the method identifies one of Australia's densest collections of
colonial dry-stone walls beyond Indigenous heritage contexts. DINO-CV achieves
a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 68.6% on test areas and maintains
63.8% mIoU when fine-tuned with only 10% labeled data. These results
demonstrate the potential of self-supervised learning on high-resolution DEM
derivatives for automated dry-stone wall mapping in vegetated and heritage-rich
environments with scarce annotations.

*Sébastien Thuau,Siba Haidar,Ayush Bajracharya,Rachid Chelouah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 比较两种节俭联邦学习方法用于暴力检测：零样本和联邦微调视觉语言模型(VLMs)与个性化训练紧凑3D卷积神经网络(CNN3D)。两种方法准确率均超90%，CNN3D在ROC AUC和log loss上略优且能耗更低，VLMs在上下文推理和多模态推理方面更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究节俭联邦学习方法用于暴力检测，特别关注能源效率和环境指标，为视频监控提供负责任、资源感知的AI基准。

Method: 使用LLaVA-7B和65.8M参数CNN3D作为代表案例，在非IID设置下评估准确率、校准和能耗。比较零样本/联邦微调VLMs与个性化CNN3D训练策略。

Result: 两种方法准确率均超过90%。CNN3D在ROC AUC和log loss上略优于LoRA调优的VLMs，且能耗更低。VLMs在上下文推理和多模态推理方面保持优势。

Conclusion: 支持混合模型：轻量级CNN用于常规分类，选择性激活VLM用于复杂或描述性场景。为视频监控提供可复现的负责任AI基准框架。

Abstract: We examine frugal federated learning approaches to violence detection by
comparing two complementary strategies: (i) zero-shot and federated fine-tuning
of vision-language models (VLMs), and (ii) personalized training of a compact
3D convolutional neural network (CNN3D). Using LLaVA-7B and a 65.8M parameter
CNN3D as representative cases, we evaluate accuracy, calibration, and energy
usage under realistic non-IID settings. Both approaches exceed 90% accuracy.
CNN3D slightly outperforms Low-Rank Adaptation(LoRA)-tuned VLMs in ROC AUC and
log loss, while using less energy. VLMs remain favorable for contextual
reasoning and multimodal inference. We quantify energy and CO$_2$ emissions
across training and inference, and analyze sustainability trade-offs for
deployment. To our knowledge, this is the first comparative study of LoRA-tuned
vision-language models and personalized CNNs for federated violence detection,
with an emphasis on energy efficiency and environmental metrics. These findings
support a hybrid model: lightweight CNNs for routine classification, with
selective VLM activation for complex or descriptive scenarios. The resulting
framework offers a reproducible baseline for responsible, resource-aware AI in
video surveillance, with extensions toward real-time, multimodal, and
lifecycle-aware systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 4DSegStreamer是一个用于4D全景分割的流式处理框架，采用双线程系统在受限时间预算内实现实时细粒度感知，可集成到现有3D/4D分割方法中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决高度动态环境（如密集人群疏散、复杂场景自动驾驶）中需要实时、细粒度感知的问题，现有方法在高FPS条件下鲁棒性不足。

Method: 采用双线程系统：预测线程利用历史运动和几何信息提取特征并预测未来动态；推理线程通过对齐最新内存并补偿自运动和动态物体移动来确保对传入帧的及时预测。

Result: 在室内HOI4D数据集和室外SemanticKITTI、nuScenes数据集上的综合实验证明了方法的有效性，特别是在复杂场景中准确预测动态物体方面表现优异。

Conclusion: 4DSegStreamer是一个通用且鲁棒的流式4D全景分割框架，能够实现实时感知，在高FPS条件下表现出色，可无缝集成到现有方法中。

Abstract: 4D panoptic segmentation in a streaming setting is critical for highly
dynamic environments, such as evacuating dense crowds and autonomous driving in
complex scenarios, where real-time, fine-grained perception within a
constrained time budget is essential. In this paper, we introduce
4DSegStreamer, a novel framework that employs a Dual-Thread System to
efficiently process streaming frames. The framework is general and can be
seamlessly integrated into existing 3D and 4D segmentation methods to enable
real-time capability. It also demonstrates superior robustness compared to
existing streaming perception approaches, particularly under high FPS
conditions. The system consists of a predictive thread and an inference thread.
The predictive thread leverages historical motion and geometric information to
extract features and forecast future dynamics. The inference thread ensures
timely prediction for incoming frames by aligning with the latest memory and
compensating for ego-motion and dynamic object movements. We evaluate
4DSegStreamer on the indoor HOI4D dataset and the outdoor SemanticKITTI and
nuScenes datasets. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of
our approach, particularly in accurately predicting dynamic objects in complex
scenes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了PICABench基准和PICAEval评估协议，系统评估图像编辑的物理真实性，涵盖光学、力学和状态转换等8个子维度，发现当前模型在物理真实性方面仍有很大提升空间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像编辑模型主要关注指令完成度，但忽视了伴随的物理效果（如阴影、反射、物体间相互作用），这些物理效果对生成真实感至关重要。

Method: 引入PICABench基准系统评估物理真实性，提出PICAEval评估协议使用VLM作为评判器，并构建PICA-100K训练数据集从视频中学习物理知识。

Result: 评估主流模型后发现，物理真实性仍然是一个具有挑战性的问题，存在很大的探索空间。

Conclusion: 该基准和解决方案为未来从简单内容编辑转向物理一致的真实感提供了基础，推动图像编辑向更高真实感发展。

Abstract: Image editing has achieved remarkable progress recently. Modern editing
models could already follow complex instructions to manipulate the original
content. However, beyond completing the editing instructions, the accompanying
physical effects are the key to the generation realism. For example, removing
an object should also remove its shadow, reflections, and interactions with
nearby objects. Unfortunately, existing models and benchmarks mainly focus on
instruction completion but overlook these physical effects. So, at this moment,
how far are we from physically realistic image editing? To answer this, we
introduce PICABench, which systematically evaluates physical realism across
eight sub-dimension (spanning optics, mechanics, and state transitions) for
most of the common editing operations (add, remove, attribute change, etc). We
further propose the PICAEval, a reliable evaluation protocol that uses
VLM-as-a-judge with per-case, region-level human annotations and questions.
Beyond benchmarking, we also explore effective solutions by learning physics
from videos and construct a training dataset PICA-100K. After evaluating most
of the mainstream models, we observe that physical realism remains a
challenging problem with large rooms to explore. We hope that our benchmark and
proposed solutions can serve as a foundation for future work moving from naive
content editing toward physically consistent realism.

TL;DR: 提出IC-MoE模型，通过混合专家架构和语义引导对比学习，增强医学图像分割基础模型的高层特征表示能力，同时保持预训练权重的结构完整性。


<details>

Motivation: 现有医学图像分割基础模型微调方法存在两个关键问题：高层特征表示不足，以及微调过程破坏预训练权重的结构完整性。

Method: 1) 构建基础专家、语义专家和自适应专家，采用像素概率自适应投票策略进行专家选择和融合；2) 提出语义引导对比学习方法解决对比学习中弱监督问题。

Result: 在三个公共医学图像分割数据集上的实验表明，IC-MoE优于其他SOTA模型，有效增强了高层特征表示并保持了预训练结构完整性。

Conclusion: IC-MoE成功补充了基础医学图像分割模型的高层特征和预训练结构完整性，并在多样化医学图像分割场景中展现出优越的泛化能力。

Abstract: Foundation models for medical image segmentation have achieved remarkable
performance. Adaptive fine-tuning of natural image segmentation foundation
models is crucial for medical image segmentation tasks. However, some
limitations exist in existing fine-tuning methods: 1) insufficient
representation of high-level features and 2) the fine-tuning process disrupts
the structural integrity of pretrained weights. Inspired by these critical
problems, we propose an intelligent communication mixture-of-experts
boosted-medical image segmentation foundation model, named IC-MoE, with twofold
ideas: 1) We construct basic experts, semantic experts, and adaptive experts.
Moreover, we implement a pixel probability adaptive voting strategy, which
enables expert selection and fusion through label consistency and load
balancing. This approach preliminarily enhances the representation capability
of high-level features while preserving the structural integrity of pretrained
weights. 2) We propose a semantic-guided contrastive learning method to address
the issue of weak supervision in contrastive learning. This method further
enhances the representation capability of high-level features while preserving
the structural integrity of pretrained weights. Extensive experiments across
three public medical image segmentation datasets demonstrate that the IC-MoE
outperforms other SOTA models. Consequently, the proposed IC-MoE effectively
supplements foundational medical image segmentation models with high-level
features and pretrained structural integrity. We also validate the superior
generalizability of the IC-MoE across diverse medical image segmentation
scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像人物检索方法存在模态异质性挑战，全局方法忽略细粒度差异，局部方法需要先验信息，且当前方法主要针对英语，限制了多语言应用。

Method: 提出Bi-IRRA框架，包含双向隐式关系推理模块（通过掩码图像和文本的双向预测增强跨语言和跨模态的局部关系建模）和多维全局对齐模块（桥接模态异质性）。

Result: 在所有多语言TIPR数据集上取得了新的最先进结果。

Conclusion: Bi-IRRA框架有效解决了多语言文本到图像人物检索中的模态异质性问题，实现了跨语言和跨模态的精确对齐。

Abstract: Text-to-image person retrieval (TIPR) aims to identify the target person
using textual descriptions, facing challenge in modality heterogeneity. Prior
works have attempted to address it by developing cross-modal global or local
alignment strategies. However, global methods typically overlook fine-grained
cross-modal differences, whereas local methods require prior information to
explore explicit part alignments. Additionally, current methods are
English-centric, restricting their application in multilingual contexts. To
alleviate these issues, we pioneer a multilingual TIPR task by developing a
multilingual TIPR benchmark, for which we leverage large language models for
initial translations and refine them by integrating domain-specific knowledge.
Correspondingly, we propose Bi-IRRA: a Bidirectional Implicit Relation
Reasoning and Aligning framework to learn alignment across languages and
modalities. Within Bi-IRRA, a bidirectional implicit relation reasoning module
enables bidirectional prediction of masked image and text, implicitly enhancing
the modeling of local relations across languages and modalities, a
multi-dimensional global alignment module is integrated to bridge the modality
heterogeneity. The proposed method achieves new state-of-the-art results on all
multilingual TIPR datasets. Data and code are presented in
https://github.com/Flame-Chasers/Bi-IRRA.

Motivation: 现有3D物体检测方法在开放世界场景中泛化能力不足，传统闭集检测器难以处理未见物体，而直接应用3D开放词汇模型又面临词汇扩展和语义重叠问题。

Method: 结合2D基础模型的强泛化能力和零样本能力，利用2D语义先验和3D几何先验生成类别无关的候选区域，通过跨模态专家混合动态路由单模态和多模态特征来学习广义3D物体性。

Result: 在广泛实验中，OP3Det显著超越现有开放世界3D检测器达16.0%的AR提升，相比闭世界3D检测器提升13.5%。

Conclusion: OP3Det通过融合2D语义先验和3D几何先验，实现了卓越的开放世界3D物体检测性能，证明了其在广义3D物体发现方面的有效性。

Abstract: Recent advancements in 3D object detection and novel category detection have
made significant progress, yet research on learning generalized 3D objectness
remains insufficient. In this paper, we delve into learning open-world 3D
objectness, which focuses on detecting all objects in a 3D scene, including
novel objects unseen during training. Traditional closed-set 3D detectors
struggle to generalize to open-world scenarios, while directly incorporating 3D
open-vocabulary models for open-world ability struggles with vocabulary
expansion and semantic overlap. To achieve generalized 3D object discovery, We
propose OP3Det, a class-agnostic Open-World Prompt-free 3D Detector to detect
any objects within 3D scenes without relying on hand-crafted text prompts. We
introduce the strong generalization and zero-shot capabilities of 2D foundation
models, utilizing both 2D semantic priors and 3D geometric priors for
class-agnostic proposals to broaden 3D object discovery. Then, by integrating
complementary information from point cloud and RGB image in the cross-modal
mixture of experts, OP3Det dynamically routes uni-modal and multi-modal
features to learn generalized 3D objectness. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the extraordinary performance of OP3Det, which significantly surpasses existing
open-world 3D detectors by up to 16.0% in AR and achieves a 13.5% improvement
compared to closed-world 3D detectors.

Motivation: 现有扩散模型虽然生成质量优秀，但采样过程计算昂贵。现有的梯度优化方法虽然减少了函数评估次数，但依赖复杂训练技巧且不能很好地保留细节。

Method: 提出广义求解器——一种简单的ODE采样器参数化方法，无需额外训练技巧；进一步结合对抗训练来减少伪影并增强细节保真度。

Result: 在相似资源约束下，该方法相比现有求解器训练方法表现出更优越的性能。

Conclusion: 广义对抗求解器提供了一种简单有效的扩散模型加速采样方案，在保持生成质量的同时显著提升了采样效率。

Abstract: While diffusion models achieve state-of-the-art generation quality, they
still suffer from computationally expensive sampling. Recent works address this
issue with gradient-based optimization methods that distill a few-step ODE
diffusion solver from the full sampling process, reducing the number of
function evaluations from dozens to just a few. However, these approaches often
rely on intricate training techniques and do not explicitly focus on preserving
fine-grained details. In this paper, we introduce the Generalized Solver: a
simple parameterization of the ODE sampler that does not require additional
training tricks and improves quality over existing approaches. We further
combine the original distillation loss with adversarial training, which
mitigates artifacts and enhances detail fidelity. We call the resulting method
the Generalized Adversarial Solver and demonstrate its superior performance
compared to existing solver training methods under similar resource
constraints. Code is available at https://github.com/3145tttt/GAS.

Abstract: Vision foundation models achieve remarkable performance but are only
available in a limited set of pre-determined sizes, forcing sub-optimal
deployment choices under real-world constraints. We introduce SnapViT:
Single-shot network approximation for pruned Vision Transformers, a new
post-pretraining structured pruning method that enables elastic inference
across a continuum of compute budgets. Our approach efficiently combines
gradient information with cross-network structure correlations, approximated
via an evolutionary algorithm, does not require labeled data, generalizes to
models without a classification head, and is retraining-free. Experiments on
DINO, SigLIPv2, DeIT, and AugReg models demonstrate superior performance over
state-of-the-art methods across various sparsities, requiring less than five
minutes on a single A100 GPU to generate elastic models that can be adjusted to
any computational budget. Our key contributions include an efficient pruning
strategy for pretrained Vision Transformers, a novel evolutionary approximation
of Hessian off-diagonal structures, and a self-supervised importance scoring
mechanism that maintains strong performance without requiring retraining or
labels. Code and pruned models are available at: https://elastic.ashita.nl/

Motivation: 现有帕金森病早期检测方法存在两个主要局限：数据集不足和面对未见患者数据时鲁棒性差。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：第一阶段按绘图类型分类，第二阶段将图像分为2x2块，分别提取特征和检测帕金森病指标，最后使用集成方法合并各块决策。

Result: 在NewHandPD数据集上，对已见患者准确率达97.08%，对未见患者达94.91%，准确率差距仅为2.17个百分点，优于先前工作的4.76个百分点下降。

Conclusion: 提出的分块策略和集成方法有效提升了帕金森病检测的鲁棒性，特别是在处理未见患者数据时表现优异。

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease affecting about 1% of
people over the age of 60, causing motor impairments that impede hand
coordination activities such as writing and drawing. Many approaches have tried
to support early detection of Parkinson's disease based on hand-drawn images;
however, we identified two major limitations in the related works: (1) the lack
of sufficient datasets, (2) the robustness when dealing with unseen patient
data. In this paper, we propose a new approach to detect Parkinson's disease
that consists of two stages: The first stage classifies based on their drawing
type(circle, meander, spiral), and the second stage extracts the required
features from the images and detects Parkinson's disease. We overcame the
previous two limitations by applying a chunking strategy where we divide each
image into 2x2 chunks. Each chunk is processed separately when extracting
features and recognizing Parkinson's disease indicators. To make the final
classification, an ensemble method is used to merge the decisions made from
each chunk. Our evaluation shows that our proposed approach outperforms the top
performing state-of-the-art approaches, in particular on unseen patients. On
the NewHandPD dataset our approach, it achieved 97.08% accuracy for seen
patients and 94.91% for unseen patients, our proposed approach maintained a gap
of only 2.17 percentage points, compared to the 4.76-point drop observed in
prior work.

Conclusion: 该自动化框架有效分析流式细胞术中的CCC图像，利用明场和荧光数据，具有扩展到分析免疫和肿瘤细胞簇等更广泛应用的潜力。

Abstract: Circulating blood cell clusters (CCCs) containing red blood cells (RBCs),
white blood cells(WBCs), and platelets are significant biomarkers linked to
conditions like thrombosis, infection, and inflammation. Flow cytometry, paired
with fluorescence staining, is commonly used to analyze these cell clusters,
revealing cell morphology and protein profiles. While computational approaches
based on machine learning have advanced the automatic analysis of single-cell
flow cytometry images, there is a lack of effort to build tools to
automatically analyze images containing CCCs. Unlike single cells, cell
clusters often exhibit irregular shapes and sizes. In addition, these cell
clusters often consist of heterogeneous cell types, which require multi-channel
staining to identify the specific cell types within the clusters. This study
introduces a new computational framework for analyzing CCC images and
identifying cell types within clusters. Our framework uses a two-step analysis
strategy. First, it categorizes images into cell cluster and non-cluster groups
by fine-tuning the You Only Look Once(YOLOv11) model, which outperforms
traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs), Vision Transformers (ViT).
Then, it identifies cell types by overlaying cluster contours with regions from
multi-channel fluorescence stains, enhancing accuracy despite cell debris and
staining artifacts. This approach achieved over 95% accuracy in both cluster
classification and phenotype identification. In summary, our automated
framework effectively analyzes CCC images from flow cytometry, leveraging both
bright-field and fluorescence data. Initially tested on blood cells, it holds
potential for broader applications, such as analyzing immune and tumor cell
clusters, supporting cellular research across various diseases.

*Zhiqiang Teng,Beibei Lin,Tingting Chen,Zifeng Yuan,Xuanyi Li,Xuanyu Zhang,Shunli Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RaindropGS是一个用于评估3D高斯溅射(3DGS)在雨滴干扰下性能的综合基准，包含真实世界雨滴数据集和完整的评估流程，揭示了现有方法在无约束雨滴图像上的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决3DGS在真实雨滴条件下因遮挡和光学畸变导致的严重重建质量下降问题，现有基准通常使用合成雨滴图像和已知相机位姿，无法反映真实场景中雨滴对相机位姿估计和点云初始化的干扰。

Method: 提出RaindropGS基准，包含数据准备、数据处理和雨滴感知3DGS评估三部分，收集真实世界雨滴重建数据集，包含雨滴聚焦、背景聚焦和无雨地面真值三种对齐图像集。

Result: 通过全面实验揭示了现有3DGS方法在无约束雨滴图像上的性能限制，以及不同流水线组件的影响：相机焦点位置对3DGS重建性能的影响，不准确的位姿和点云初始化对重建的干扰。

Conclusion: 为开发在雨滴条件下更鲁棒的3DGS方法提供了明确方向，建立了全面的评估基准来推动该领域的发展。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) under raindrop conditions suffers from severe
occlusions and optical distortions caused by raindrop contamination on the
camera lens, substantially degrading reconstruction quality. Existing
benchmarks typically evaluate 3DGS using synthetic raindrop images with known
camera poses (constrained images), assuming ideal conditions. However, in
real-world scenarios, raindrops often interfere with accurate camera pose
estimation and point cloud initialization. Moreover, a significant domain gap
between synthetic and real raindrops further impairs generalization. To tackle
these issues, we introduce RaindropGS, a comprehensive benchmark designed to
evaluate the full 3DGS pipeline-from unconstrained, raindrop-corrupted images
to clear 3DGS reconstructions. Specifically, the whole benchmark pipeline
consists of three parts: data preparation, data processing, and raindrop-aware
3DGS evaluation, including types of raindrop interference, camera pose
estimation and point cloud initialization, single image rain removal
comparison, and 3D Gaussian training comparison. First, we collect a real-world
raindrop reconstruction dataset, in which each scene contains three aligned
image sets: raindrop-focused, background-focused, and rain-free ground truth,
enabling a comprehensive evaluation of reconstruction quality under different
focus conditions. Through comprehensive experiments and analyses, we reveal
critical insights into the performance limitations of existing 3DGS methods on
unconstrained raindrop images and the varying impact of different pipeline
components: the impact of camera focus position on 3DGS reconstruction
performance, and the interference caused by inaccurate pose and point cloud
initialization on reconstruction. These insights establish clear directions for
developing more robust 3DGS methods under raindrop conditions.

Abstract: The recent development of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has
significantly advanced AI's ability to understand visual modalities. However,
existing evaluation benchmarks remain limited to single-turn question
answering, overlooking the complexity of multi-turn dialogues in real-world
scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce MT-Video-Bench, a holistic video
understanding benchmark for evaluating MLLMs in multi-turn dialogues.
Specifically, our MT-Video-Bench mainly assesses six core competencies that
focus on perceptivity and interactivity, encompassing 987 meticulously curated
multi-turn dialogues from diverse domains. These capabilities are rigorously
aligned with real-world applications, such as interactive sports analysis and
multi-turn video-based intelligent tutoring. With MT-Video-Bench, we
extensively evaluate various state-of-the-art open-source and closed-source
MLLMs, revealing their significant performance discrepancies and limitations in
handling multi-turn video dialogues. The benchmark will be publicly available
to foster future research.

TL;DR: 该研究比较了基于原始签名图像和壳预处理两种方法在签名伪造检测中的跨数据集泛化性能，发现原始图像模型在多个基准测试中表现更好，而壳预处理方法显示出未来改进的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决离线签名验证中深度学习模型难以跨数据集泛化的问题，因为笔迹风格和采集协议的差异会降低模型性能。

Method: 使用三个公共基准数据集（CEDAR、ICDAR、GPDS Synthetic），开发了两个实验流程：基于原始签名图像的方法和采用壳预处理的方法。

Result: 原始图像模型在跨基准测试中获得了更高的性能，而基于壳预处理的方法显示出未来改进的潜力。

Conclusion: 虽然原始图像方法在当前表现更好，但壳预处理方法为开发鲁棒的跨域签名验证系统提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Automated signature verification is a critical biometric technique used in
banking, identity authentication, and legal documentation. Despite the notable
progress achieved by deep learning methods, most approaches in offline
signature verification still struggle to generalize across datasets, as
variations in handwriting styles and acquisition protocols often degrade
performance. This study investigates feature learning strategies for signature
forgery detection, focusing on improving cross-dataset generalization -- that
is, model robustness when trained on one dataset and tested on another. Using
three public benchmarks -- CEDAR, ICDAR, and GPDS Synthetic -- two experimental
pipelines were developed: one based on raw signature images and another
employing a preprocessing method referred to as shell preprocessing. Several
behavioral patterns were identified and analyzed; however, no definitive
superiority between the two approaches was established. The results show that
the raw-image model achieved higher performance across benchmarks, while the
shell-based model demonstrated promising potential for future refinement toward
robust, cross-domain signature verification.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多参考视觉位置识别中，现有方法在数据多样性和模型复杂度增加时带来的高计算成本问题，以及描述符级融合方法在视角和外观变化下效果有限的问题。

Method: 使用矩阵分解将多个参考描述符联合建模为基表示，实现基于投影的残差匹配，该方法无需训练且描述符无关。

Result: 在多外观数据上，Recall@1比单参考方法提升约18%，在视角和外观变化下均优于多参考基线方法，在非结构化数据上提升约5%。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持轻量级的同时，在多参考视觉位置识别中表现出强大的泛化能力，显著提升了定位性能。

Abstract: We address multi-reference visual place recognition (VPR), where reference
sets captured under varying conditions are used to improve localisation
performance. While deep learning with large-scale training improves robustness,
increasing data diversity and model complexity incur extensive computational
cost during training and deployment. Descriptor-level fusion via voting or
aggregation avoids training, but often targets multi-sensor setups or relies on
heuristics with limited gains under appearance and viewpoint change. We propose
a training-free, descriptor-agnostic approach that jointly models places using
multiple reference descriptors via matrix decomposition into basis
representations, enabling projection-based residual matching. We also introduce
SotonMV, a structured benchmark for multi-viewpoint VPR. On multi-appearance
data, our method improves Recall@1 by up to ~18% over single-reference and
outperforms multi-reference baselines across appearance and viewpoint changes,
with gains of ~5% on unstructured data, demonstrating strong generalisation
while remaining lightweight.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于双编码器和注意力机制的方法，结合病灶分割和临床元数据，提高皮肤癌分类的准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 皮肤癌早期检测至关重要，但现有深度学习模型存在"黑箱"问题，缺乏临床信任。病灶的高类内变异性和细微类间差异也增加了自动诊断的挑战。

Method: 使用带双注意力门和空洞空间金字塔池化的Deep-UNet进行病灶分割；分类阶段采用两个DenseNet201编码器分别处理原始图像和分割病灶，通过多头交叉注意力融合特征；集成基于transformer的模块处理患者元数据。

Result: 在HAM10000数据集和ISIC 2018、2019挑战中，实现了最先进的分割性能，显著提高了分类准确率和平均AUC。Grad-CAM热图证实模型基于病灶区域进行预测。

Conclusion: 将精确的病灶分割、临床数据与基于注意力的特征融合相结合，可以构建更准确和可解释的皮肤癌分类模型。

Abstract: Skin cancer is a life-threatening disease where early detection significantly
improves patient outcomes. Automated diagnosis from dermoscopic images is
challenging due to high intra-class variability and subtle inter-class
differences. Many deep learning models operate as "black boxes," limiting
clinical trust. In this work, we propose a dual-encoder attention-based
framework that leverages both segmented lesions and clinical metadata to
enhance skin lesion classification in terms of both accuracy and
interpretability. A novel Deep-UNet architecture with Dual Attention Gates
(DAG) and Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP) is first employed to segment
lesions. The classification stage uses two DenseNet201 encoders-one on the
original image and another on the segmented lesion whose features are fused via
multi-head cross-attention. This dual-input design guides the model to focus on
salient pathological regions. In addition, a transformer-based module
incorporates patient metadata (age, sex, lesion site) into the prediction. We
evaluate our approach on the HAM10000 dataset and the ISIC 2018 and 2019
challenges. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art segmentation
performance and significantly improves classification accuracy and average AUC
compared to baseline models. To validate our model's reliability, we use
Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) to generate heatmaps.
These visualizations confirm that our model's predictions are based on the
lesion area, unlike models that rely on spurious background features. These
results demonstrate that integrating precise lesion segmentation and clinical
data with attention-based fusion leads to a more accurate and interpretable
skin cancer classification model.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SparseVILA是一个新的高效视觉语言模型推理范式，通过在预填充阶段剪枝冗余视觉token，在解码阶段仅检索查询相关token，实现视觉稀疏性的解耦，显著提升推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型的可扩展性受到视觉token数量增长的限制，这些token主导了推理延迟。需要一种方法来减少视觉token数量而不牺牲模型能力。

Method: 提出解耦的视觉稀疏性方法：预填充阶段剪枝冗余视觉token，解码阶段检索查询相关token。基于AWQ优化的推理流水线实现。

Result: 在长上下文视频任务上实现4.0倍预填充加速、2.5倍解码加速和2.6倍端到端加速，同时在文档理解和推理任务上提高准确性。

Conclusion: 通过解耦查询无关剪枝和查询感知检索，SparseVILA为高效多模态推理开辟了新方向，提供无需训练、架构无关的加速框架。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have rapidly advanced in integrating visual and
textual reasoning, powering applications across high-resolution image
understanding, long-video analysis, and multi-turn conversation. However, their
scalability remains limited by the growing number of visual tokens that
dominate inference latency. We present SparseVILA, a new paradigm for efficient
VLM inference that decouples visual sparsity across the prefilling and decoding
stages. SparseVILA distributes sparsity across stages by pruning redundant
visual tokens during prefill and retrieving only query-relevant tokens during
decoding. This decoupled design matches leading prefill pruning methods while
preserving multi-turn fidelity by retaining most of the visual cache so that
query-aware tokens can be retrieved at each conversation round. Built on an
AWQ-optimized inference pipeline, SparseVILA achieves up to 4.0 times faster
prefilling, 2.5 times faster decoding, and an overall 2.6 times end-to-end
speedup on long-context video tasks -- while improving accuracy on
document-understanding and reasoning tasks. By decoupling query-agnostic
pruning and query-aware retrieval, SparseVILA establishes a new direction for
efficient multimodal inference, offering a training-free, architecture-agnostic
framework for accelerating large VLMs without sacrificing capability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UltraCUA是一个基础模型，通过混合动作将GUI基本操作与高级程序化工具调用无缝集成，解决了计算机使用代理的视觉定位和执行链问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的计算机使用代理仅依赖基本动作（点击、输入、滚动），需要准确的视觉定位和冗长的执行链，导致级联失败和性能瓶颈。这些代理与丰富的程序化接口（API、MCP服务器、工具）隔离。

Method: 方法包括四个关键组件：(1)从软件文档、开源仓库和代码生成中扩展程序化工具的自动化流水线；(2)生成超过17,000个可验证任务的合成数据引擎；(3)大规模高质量混合动作轨迹收集；(4)结合监督微调和在线强化学习的两阶段训练管道。

Result: 实验显示，7B和32B模型相比最先进代理有显著改进。在OSWorld上，UltraCUA模型相比基础模型平均相对改进22%，步骤速度提升11%。在WindowsAgentArena的域外评估中，模型达到21.7%的成功率，优于在Windows数据上训练的基线。

Conclusion: 混合动作机制至关重要，减少了错误传播同时保持了执行效率。

Abstract: Multimodal agents for computer use rely exclusively on primitive actions
(click, type, scroll) that require accurate visual grounding and lengthy
execution chains, leading to cascading failures and performance bottlenecks.
While other agents leverage rich programmatic interfaces (APIs, MCP servers,
tools), computer-use agents (CUAs) remain isolated from these capabilities. We
present UltraCUA, a foundation model that bridges this gap through hybrid
action -- seamlessly integrating GUI primitives with high-level programmatic
tool calls. To achieve this, our approach comprises four key components: (1) an
automated pipeline that scales programmatic tools from software documentation,
open-source repositories, and code generation; (2) a synthetic data engine
producing over 17,000 verifiable tasks spanning real-world computer-use
scenarios; (3) a large-scale high-quality hybrid action trajectory collection
with both low-level GUI actions and high-level programmatic tool calls; and (4)
a two-stage training pipeline combining supervised fine-tuning with online
reinforcement learning, enabling strategic alternation between low-level and
high-level actions. Experiments with our 7B and 32B models demonstrate
substantial improvements over state-of-the-art agents. On OSWorld, UltraCUA
models achieve an average 22% relative improvement over base models, while
being 11% faster in terms of steps. Out-of-domain evaluation on
WindowsAgentArena shows our model reaches 21.7% success rate, outperforming
baselines trained on Windows data. The hybrid action mechanism proves critical,
reducing error propagation while maintaining execution efficiency.

TL;DR: Glyph框架通过将长文本渲染为图像，利用视觉语言模型处理，实现3-4倍的token压缩，在保持准确性的同时显著提升处理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型在处理百万token级别长上下文时面临的高计算和内存成本问题。

Method: 将长文本渲染成图像，使用视觉语言模型处理，并通过LLM驱动的遗传搜索优化视觉渲染配置。

Result: 在多个长上下文基准测试中达到与Qwen3-8B相当的准确性，同时实现3-4倍token压缩、4倍加速预填充和解码、2倍加速SFT训练。

Conclusion: 视觉上下文扩展方法为长文本处理提供了高效解决方案，128K上下文VLM可扩展到处理1M token任务，且对多模态任务有益。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly rely on long-context modeling for
tasks such as document understanding, code analysis, and multi-step reasoning.
However, scaling context windows to the million-token level brings prohibitive
computational and memory costs, limiting the practicality of long-context LLMs.
In this work, we take a different perspective-visual context scaling-to tackle
this challenge. Instead of extending token-based sequences, we propose Glyph, a
framework that renders long texts into images and processes them with
vision-language models (VLMs). This approach substantially compresses textual
input while preserving semantic information, and we further design an
LLM-driven genetic search to identify optimal visual rendering configurations
for balancing accuracy and compression. Through extensive experiments, we
demonstrate that our method achieves 3-4x token compression while maintaining
accuracy comparable to leading LLMs such as Qwen3-8B on various long-context
benchmarks. This compression also leads to around 4x faster prefilling and
decoding, and approximately 2x faster SFT training. Furthermore, under extreme
compression, a 128K-context VLM could scale to handle 1M-token-level text
tasks. In addition, the rendered text data benefits real-world multimodal
tasks, such as document understanding. Our code and model are released at
https://github.com/thu-coai/Glyph.

TL;DR: 提出ConsistEdit方法，针对MM-DiT架构设计注意力控制机制，解决了现有训练自由编辑方法在编辑强度与一致性之间的权衡问题，支持多轮和视频编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有训练自由注意力控制方法难以同时实现强编辑能力和源图像一致性，特别是在多轮和视频编辑中视觉错误会累积。大多数方法强制全局一致性，限制了细粒度编辑能力。

Method: 基于MM-DiT架构分析，提出ConsistEdit方法，包含仅视觉注意力控制、掩码引导的前注意力融合，以及对查询、键、值令牌的差异化操作。

Result: 在广泛的图像和视频编辑任务中达到最先进性能，支持结构一致和不一致场景，是首个无需手工操作即可在所有推理步骤和注意力层进行编辑的方法。

Conclusion: ConsistEdit显著增强了可靠性和一致性，支持稳健的多轮和多区域编辑，并支持结构一致性的渐进调整，实现更精细的控制。

Abstract: Recent advances in training-free attention control methods have enabled
flexible and efficient text-guided editing capabilities for existing generation
models. However, current approaches struggle to simultaneously deliver strong
editing strength while preserving consistency with the source. This limitation
becomes particularly critical in multi-round and video editing, where visual
errors can accumulate over time. Moreover, most existing methods enforce global
consistency, which limits their ability to modify individual attributes such as
texture while preserving others, thereby hindering fine-grained editing.
Recently, the architectural shift from U-Net to MM-DiT has brought significant
improvements in generative performance and introduced a novel mechanism for
integrating text and vision modalities. These advancements pave the way for
overcoming challenges that previous methods failed to resolve. Through an
in-depth analysis of MM-DiT, we identify three key insights into its attention
mechanisms. Building on these, we propose ConsistEdit, a novel attention
control method specifically tailored for MM-DiT. ConsistEdit incorporates
vision-only attention control, mask-guided pre-attention fusion, and
differentiated manipulation of the query, key, and value tokens to produce
consistent, prompt-aligned edits. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
ConsistEdit achieves state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of image
and video editing tasks, including both structure-consistent and
structure-inconsistent scenarios. Unlike prior methods, it is the first
approach to perform editing across all inference steps and attention layers
without handcraft, significantly enhancing reliability and consistency, which
enables robust multi-round and multi-region editing. Furthermore, it supports
progressive adjustment of structural consistency, enabling finer control.

TL;DR: VAR-SLAM是一个基于ORB-SLAM3的视觉SLAM系统，结合轻量级语义关键点滤波器和自适应鲁棒损失函数，在动态环境中提高轨迹精度和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在动态环境中存在局限性：语义滤波只能处理已知物体类别，固定鲁棒核无法适应未知移动物体，导致场景中出现未知移动物体时精度下降。

Method: 结合轻量级语义关键点滤波器处理已知移动物体，使用Barron自适应鲁棒损失处理未知物体，通过在线估计鲁棒核的形状参数，自动在高斯和重尾行为之间调整。

Result: 在TUM RGB-D、Bonn RGB-D Dynamic和OpenLORIS数据集上评估，相比最先进基线方法，轨迹精度和鲁棒性均有提升，在挑战性序列上比NGD-SLAM降低高达25%的ATE RMSE，同时保持平均27 FPS的性能。

Conclusion: VAR-SLAM通过结合语义滤波和自适应鲁棒损失，有效解决了动态环境中的SLAM问题，在已知和未知移动物体场景下都表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Visual SLAM in dynamic environments remains challenging, as several existing
methods rely on semantic filtering that only handles known object classes, or
use fixed robust kernels that cannot adapt to unknown moving objects, leading
to degraded accuracy when they appear in the scene. We present VAR-SLAM (Visual
Adaptive and Robust SLAM), an ORB-SLAM3-based system that combines a
lightweight semantic keypoint filter to deal with known moving objects, with
Barron's adaptive robust loss to handle unknown ones. The shape parameter of
the robust kernel is estimated online from residuals, allowing the system to
automatically adjust between Gaussian and heavy-tailed behavior. We evaluate
VAR-SLAM on the TUM RGB-D, Bonn RGB-D Dynamic, and OpenLORIS datasets, which
include both known and unknown moving objects. Results show improved trajectory
accuracy and robustness over state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to 25%
lower ATE RMSE than NGD-SLAM on challenging sequences, while maintaining
performance at 27 FPS on average.

Abstract: Intelligent robotic disassembly of end-of-life (EOL) products has been a
long-standing challenge in robotics. While machine learning techniques have
shown promise, the lack of specialized hardware limits their application in
real-world scenarios. We introduce DeGrip, a customized gripper designed for
the disassembly of EOL computer desktops. DeGrip provides three degrees of
freedom (DOF), enabling arbitrary configurations within the disassembly
environment when mounted on a robotic manipulator. It employs a cable-driven
transmission mechanism that reduces its overall size and enables operation in
confined spaces. The wrist is designed to decouple the actuation of wrist and
jaw joints. We also developed an EOL desktop disassembly environment in Isaac
Sim to evaluate the effectiveness of DeGrip. The tasks were designed to
demonstrate its ability to operate in confined spaces and disassemble
components in arbitrary configurations. The evaluation results confirm the
capability of DeGrip for EOL desktop disassembly.

Conclusion: Cosmos-Surg-dVRK平台为复杂外科手术程序提供了有前景的自动化评估解决方案，能够有效替代昂贵的物理机器人平台评估。

Abstract: The rise of surgical robots and vision-language-action models has accelerated
the development of autonomous surgical policies and efficient assessment
strategies. However, evaluating these policies directly on physical robotic
platforms such as the da Vinci Research Kit (dVRK) remains hindered by high
costs, time demands, reproducibility challenges, and variability in execution.
World foundation models (WFM) for physical AI offer a transformative approach
to simulate complex real-world surgical tasks, such as soft tissue deformation,
with high fidelity. This work introduces Cosmos-Surg-dVRK, a surgical finetune
of the Cosmos WFM, which, together with a trained video classifier, enables
fully automated online evaluation and benchmarking of surgical policies. We
evaluate Cosmos-Surg-dVRK using two distinct surgical datasets. On tabletop
suture pad tasks, the automated pipeline achieves strong correlation between
online rollouts in Cosmos-Surg-dVRK and policy outcomes on the real dVRK Si
platform, as well as good agreement between human labelers and the V-JEPA
2-derived video classifier. Additionally, preliminary experiments with ex-vivo
porcine cholecystectomy tasks in Cosmos-Surg-dVRK demonstrate promising
alignment with real-world evaluations, highlighting the platform's potential
for more complex surgical procedures.

### [185] [NEBULA: Do We Evaluate Vision-Language-Action Agents Correctly?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16263)
*Jierui Peng,Yanyan Zhang,Yicheng Duan,Tuo Liang,Vipin Chaudhary,Yu Yin*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: NEBULA是一个用于单臂操作任务的统一评估生态系统，通过细粒度能力测试和系统压力测试来解决VLA智能体评估中的问题，提供精确的技能诊断和鲁棒性测量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前VLA智能体的评估存在两个主要问题：1）粗粒度的最终任务成功率无法提供精确的技能诊断；2）碎片化的数据环境阻碍了可重复研究和通用模型的发展。

Method: 提出了NEBULA生态系统，包括：1）双轴评估协议（能力测试+压力测试）；2）标准化API；3）大规模聚合数据集。能力测试用于精确技能诊断，压力测试用于测量鲁棒性。

Result: 使用NEBULA评估发现，表现最佳的VLA智能体在空间推理和动态适应等关键能力上存在困难，这些缺陷被传统的最终任务成功率指标所掩盖。

Conclusion: NEBULA通过同时测量智能体能够做什么以及在什么情况下可靠执行，为开发鲁棒、通用的具身智能体提供了实用基础。

Abstract: The evaluation of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) agents is hindered by the
coarse, end-task success metric that fails to provide precise skill diagnosis
or measure robustness to real-world perturbations. This challenge is
exacerbated by a fragmented data landscape that impedes reproducible research
and the development of generalist models. To address these limitations, we
introduce \textbf{NEBULA}, a unified ecosystem for single-arm manipulation that
enables diagnostic and reproducible evaluation. NEBULA features a novel
dual-axis evaluation protocol that combines fine-grained \textit{capability
tests} for precise skill diagnosis with systematic \textit{stress tests} that
measure robustness. A standardized API and a large-scale, aggregated dataset
are provided to reduce fragmentation and support cross-dataset training and
fair comparison. Using NEBULA, we demonstrate that top-performing VLAs struggle
with key capabilities such as spatial reasoning and dynamic adaptation, which
are consistently obscured by conventional end-task success metrics. By
measuring both what an agent can do and when it does so reliably, NEBULA
provides a practical foundation for robust, general-purpose embodied agents.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练的运行时策略引导方法，通过模拟候选动作序列并使用视觉语言模型选择与文本计划最一致的动作，提升推理-动作对齐能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的推理VLA模型即使生成正确的文本计划，在分布外场景中生成的动作仍可能偏离预期结果，存在推理与动作不一致的问题。

Method: 从同一模型采样多个候选动作序列，通过模拟预测结果，使用预训练VLM选择与文本计划最一致的动作序列执行。

Result: 在行为组合任务上比先前工作提升15%性能，增强了语义和视觉分布外扰动的鲁棒性，无需重新训练即可实现新行为组合。

Conclusion: 将基础VLA的自然动作多样性从错误来源转变为优势，通过推理-动作对齐提升了模型的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Reasoning Vision Language Action (VLA) models improve robotic
instruction-following by generating step-by-step textual plans before low-level
actions, an approach inspired by Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in language
models. Yet even with a correct textual plan, the generated actions can still
miss the intended outcomes in the plan, especially in out-of-distribution (OOD)
scenarios. We formalize this phenomenon as a lack of embodied CoT faithfulness,
and introduce a training-free, runtime policy steering method for
reasoning-action alignment. Given a reasoning VLA's intermediate textual plan,
our framework samples multiple candidate action sequences from the same model,
predicts their outcomes via simulation, and uses a pre-trained Vision-Language
Model (VLM) to select the sequence whose outcome best aligns with the VLA's own
textual plan. Only executing action sequences that align with the textual
reasoning turns our base VLA's natural action diversity from a source of error
into a strength, boosting robustness to semantic and visual OOD perturbations
and enabling novel behavior composition without costly re-training. We also
contribute a reasoning-annotated extension of LIBERO-100, environment
variations tailored for OOD evaluation, and demonstrate up to 15% performance
gain over prior work on behavior composition tasks and scales with compute and
data diversity. Project Website at:

*Chi Zhang,Xian Huang,Wei Dong*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SPOT是一个统一规划框架，通过障碍物威胁建模将感知目标显式融入运动优化，解决了单深度相机无人机在动态障碍物避障中的视野限制和盲区问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 配备单深度相机的无人机由于视野有限和不可避免的盲区，在动态障碍物避障方面面临重大挑战。现有方法将运动规划与感知考虑分离，导致障碍物响应效果不佳且延迟。

Method: 核心是基于高斯过程的障碍物信念地图，建立已识别和潜在障碍物的统一概率表示。通过碰撞感知推理机制将空间不确定性和轨迹邻近度转化为时变观测紧急度地图，并在当前视野内集成紧急度值定义可微分目标。

Result: 仿真和真实环境实验表明，该方法比基线方法提前2.8秒检测到潜在动态障碍物，动态障碍物可见性提高超过500%，能够在杂乱、遮挡环境中安全导航。

Conclusion: SPOT框架实现了实时、感知感知的轨迹规划，计算时间低于10毫秒，有效解决了动态障碍物避障中的感知限制问题。

Abstract: UAVs equipped with a single depth camera encounter significant challenges in
dynamic obstacle avoidance due to limited field of view and inevitable blind
spots. While active vision strategies that steer onboard cameras have been
proposed to expand sensing coverage, most existing methods separate motion
planning from sensing considerations, resulting in less effective and delayed
obstacle response. To address this limitation, we introduce SPOT
(Sensing-augmented Planning via Obstacle Threat modeling), a unified planning
framework for observation-aware trajectory planning that explicitly
incorporates sensing objectives into motion optimization. At the core of our
method is a Gaussian Process-based obstacle belief map, which establishes a
unified probabilistic representation of both recognized (previously observed)
and potential obstacles. This belief is further processed through a
collision-aware inference mechanism that transforms spatial uncertainty and
trajectory proximity into a time-varying observation urgency map. By
integrating urgency values within the current field of view, we define
differentiable objectives that enable real-time, observation-aware trajectory
planning with computation times under 10 ms. Simulation and real-world
experiments in dynamic, cluttered, and occluded environments show that our
method detects potential dynamic obstacles 2.8 seconds earlier than baseline
approaches, increasing dynamic obstacle visibility by over 500\%, and enabling
safe navigation through cluttered, occluded environments.

TL;DR: 提出了Manual2Skill++框架，将连接器作为装配任务的一等公民，从装配手册中自动提取结构化连接信息，构建层次化图表示，并在仿真环境中验证了从任务理解到执行的完整流程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统机器人装配方法将连接器视为次要考虑，而连接器实际上是决定装配成败的关键"最后一公里"。本文旨在将连接器作为装配表示的核心元素。

Method: 使用Manual2Skill++视觉语言框架，从装配手册中解析符号图表和注释，构建层次化图表示，其中节点代表零件和子装配体，边明确建模组件间的连接关系。

Result: 构建了包含20多个装配任务的数据集，在仿真环境中验证了四个复杂装配场景（家具、玩具、制造组件），展示了从任务理解到执行的完整流程。

Conclusion: 将连接器作为一等公民的装配表示方法能够有效提取和利用人类设计指令中嵌入的连接知识，为机器人装配提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Assembly hinges on reliably forming connections between parts; yet most
robotic approaches plan assembly sequences and part poses while treating
connectors as an afterthought. Connections represent the critical "last mile"
of assembly execution, while task planning may sequence operations and motion
plan may position parts, the precise establishment of physical connections
ultimately determines assembly success or failure. In this paper, we consider
connections as first-class primitives in assembly representation, including
connector types, specifications, quantities, and placement locations. Drawing
inspiration from how humans learn assembly tasks through step-by-step
instruction manuals, we present Manual2Skill++, a vision-language framework
that automatically extracts structured connection information from assembly
manuals. We encode assembly tasks as hierarchical graphs where nodes represent
parts and sub-assemblies, and edges explicitly model connection relationships
between components. A large-scale vision-language model parses symbolic
diagrams and annotations in manuals to instantiate these graphs, leveraging the
rich connection knowledge embedded in human-designed instructions. We curate a
dataset containing over 20 assembly tasks with diverse connector types to
validate our representation extraction approach, and evaluate the complete task
understanding-to-execution pipeline across four complex assembly scenarios in
simulation, spanning furniture, toys, and manufacturing components with
real-world correspondence.

Motivation: 现有方法忽略了机器人功能与通信条件之间的相互依赖性，导致过度的通信开销。

Method: 设计并实现基于模仿学习的神经网络，通过LTO范式动态调整压缩比、传输频率和发射功率等通信策略。

Result: 实验证明IPMC方法的优越性，LTO的计算复杂度比现有优化求解器降低10倍以上，具备实时执行能力。

Conclusion: IPMC革命性地改进了边缘机器人系统，通过集成感知、运动和通信实现高效的动态通信策略调整。

Abstract: Edge robotics involves frequent exchanges of large-volume multi-modal data.
Existing methods ignore the interdependency between robotic functionalities and
communication conditions, leading to excessive communication overhead. This
paper revolutionizes edge robotics systems through integrated perception,
motion, and communication (IPMC). As such, robots can dynamically adapt their
communication strategies (i.e., compression ratio, transmission frequency,
transmit power) by leveraging the knowledge of robotic perception and motion
dynamics, thus reducing the need for excessive sensor data uploads.
Furthermore, by leveraging the learning to optimize (LTO) paradigm, an
imitation learning neural network is designed and implemented, which reduces
the computational complexity by over 10x compared to state-of-the art
optimization solvers. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed
IPMC and the real-time execution capability of LTO.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一个包含1,893个家庭机器人用户问题的数据集，涵盖12个类别和70个子类别，为机器人问答系统开发提供重要基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型和对话界面在人机交互中的广泛应用，机器人回答用户问题的能力变得至关重要。现有可解释机器人研究主要关注"为什么"问题，但用户实际上会提出各种类型的问题。

Method: 通过创建15个视频刺激和7个文本刺激，展示机器人执行各种家庭任务的情景，然后在Prolific平台上向100名参与者收集他们在每个情景中想要询问机器人的问题。

Result: 数据集中最常见的类别是任务执行细节问题（22.5%）、机器人能力问题（12.7%）和性能评估问题（11.3%）。用户认为处理困难场景和确保正确行为的问题虽然频率较低，但最重要。新手用户与有经验用户的问题类型存在差异。

Conclusion: 该数据集为识别机器人需要记录和暴露的信息、基准测试问答模块以及设计符合用户期望的解释策略提供了宝贵基础，有助于机器人在共享环境中更好地与人类交互。

Abstract: With the growing use of large language models and conversational interfaces
in human-robot interaction, robots' ability to answer user questions is more
important than ever. We therefore introduce a dataset of 1,893 user questions
for household robots, collected from 100 participants and organized into 12
categories and 70 subcategories. Most work in explainable robotics focuses on
why-questions. In contrast, our dataset provides a wide variety of questions,
from questions about simple execution details to questions about how the robot
would act in hypothetical scenarios -- thus giving roboticists valuable
insights into what questions their robot needs to be able to answer. To collect
the dataset, we created 15 video stimuli and 7 text stimuli, depicting robots
performing varied household tasks. We then asked participants on Prolific what
questions they would want to ask the robot in each portrayed situation. In the
final dataset, the most frequent categories are questions about task execution
details (22.5%), the robot's capabilities (12.7%), and performance assessments
(11.3%). Although questions about how robots would handle potentially difficult
scenarios and ensure correct behavior are less frequent, users rank them as the
most important for robots to be able to answer. Moreover, we find that users
who identify as novices in robotics ask different questions than more
experienced users. Novices are more likely to inquire about simple facts, such
as what the robot did or the current state of the environment. As robots enter
environments shared with humans and language becomes central to giving
instructions and interaction, this dataset provides a valuable foundation for
(i) identifying the information robots need to log and expose to conversational
interfaces, (ii) benchmarking question-answering modules, and (iii) designing
explanation strategies that align with user expectations.

Abstract: A major bottleneck in off-road autonomous driving research lies in the
scarcity of large-scale, high-quality datasets and benchmarks. To bridge this
gap, we present ORAD-3D, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the largest
dataset specifically curated for off-road autonomous driving. ORAD-3D covers a
wide spectrum of terrains, including woodlands, farmlands, grasslands,
riversides, gravel roads, cement roads, and rural areas, while capturing
diverse environmental variations across weather conditions (sunny, rainy,
foggy, and snowy) and illumination levels (bright daylight, daytime, twilight,
and nighttime). Building upon this dataset, we establish a comprehensive suite
of benchmark evaluations spanning five fundamental tasks: 2D free-space
detection, 3D occupancy prediction, rough GPS-guided path planning,
vision-language model-driven autonomous driving, and world model for off-road
environments. Together, the dataset and benchmarks provide a unified and robust
resource for advancing perception and planning in challenging off-road
scenarios. The dataset and code will be made publicly available at

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型SPD机械夹爪，具有线性平行夹持功能，无需调整整体高度即可抓取桌面上的各种尺寸物体，解决了传统平行夹爪弧形运动轨迹带来的碰撞问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统工业平行夹爪的指尖呈现弧形运动轨迹，需要调整整个机械臂高度以避免与桌面碰撞，这限制了抓取效率和应用场景。

Method: 设计了具有手掌和两个机械结构相同、对称排列手指的SPD夹爪，指尖遵循线性运动轨迹，可独立驱动或由单个电机驱动，并进行了优化分析理论研究和原型开发测试。

Result: 实验结果表明，该机械夹爪成功实现了线性平行夹持功能，并表现出良好的适应性，能够有效抓取不同形状和尺寸的物体。

Conclusion: SPD夹爪为各种机器人实现有效抓取提供了解决方案，为收集数据以增强深度学习训练奠定了坚实基础，在具身智能技术发展中具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel robotic gripper, named as the SPD gripper. It
features a palm and two mechanically identical and symmetrically arranged
fingers, which can be driven independently or by a single motor. The fingertips
of the fingers follow a linear motion trajectory, facilitating the grasping of
objects of various sizes on a tabletop without the need to adjust the overall
height of the gripper. Traditional industrial grippers with parallel gripping
capabilities often exhibit an arcuate motion at the fingertips, requiring the
entire robotic arm to adjust its height to avoid collisions with the tabletop.
The SPD gripper, with its linear parallel gripping mechanism, effectively
addresses this issue. Furthermore, the SPD gripper possesses adaptive
capabilities, accommodating objects of different shapes and sizes. This paper
presents the design philosophy, fundamental composition principles, and
optimization analysis theory of the SPD gripper. Based on the design theory, a
robotic gripper prototype was developed and tested. The experimental results
demonstrate that the robotic gripper successfully achieves linear parallel
gripping functionality and exhibits good adaptability. In the context of the
ongoing development of embodied intelligence technologies, this robotic gripper
can assist various robots in achieving effective grasping, laying a solid
foundation for collecting data to enhance deep learning training.

TL;DR: DIV-Nav是一个实时导航系统，能够处理包含空间关系的复杂自由文本查询，通过语义图分解、交集计算和LVLM验证来实现高效的对象导航。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的零样本对象导航通常只支持简单对象名称查询，无法处理包含空间关系的复杂自由文本指令，如"在桌子上找遥控器"。

Method: 通过三个松弛步骤：1) 将复杂空间约束的自然语言指令分解为语义图上的简单对象查询；2) 计算个体语义信念图的交集以识别所有对象共存的区域；3) 使用LVLM验证发现的对象是否符合原始复杂空间约束。

Result: 在MultiON基准测试和波士顿动力Spot机器人上的真实世界部署中进行了广泛实验验证。

Conclusion: DIV-Nav系统能够有效处理复杂空间关系的导航查询，并改进了在线语义映射的前沿探索目标以适应此类空间搜索查询。

Abstract: Advances in open-vocabulary semantic mapping and object navigation have
enabled robots to perform an informed search of their environment for an
arbitrary object. However, such zero-shot object navigation is typically
designed for simple queries with an object name like "television" or "blue
rug". Here, we consider more complex free-text queries with spatial
relationships, such as "find the remote on the table" while still leveraging
robustness of a semantic map. We present DIV-Nav, a real-time navigation system
that efficiently addresses this problem through a series of relaxations: i)
Decomposing natural language instructions with complex spatial constraints into
simpler object-level queries on a semantic map, ii) computing the Intersection
of individual semantic belief maps to identify regions where all objects
co-exist, and iii) Validating the discovered objects against the original,
complex spatial constrains via a LVLM. We further investigate how to adapt the
frontier exploration objectives of online semantic mapping to such spatial
search queries to more effectively guide the search process. We validate our
system through extensive experiments on the MultiON benchmark and real-world
deployment on a Boston Dynamics Spot robot using a Jetson Orin AGX. More

Abstract: This paper presents the SP-Diff parallel gripper system, addressing the
limited adaptability of conventional end-effectors in intelligent industrial
automation. The proposed design employs an innovative differential linkage
mechanism with a modular symmetric dual-finger configuration to achieve
linear-parallel grasping. By integrating a planetary gear transmission, the
system enables synchronized linear motion and independent finger pose
adjustment while maintaining structural rigidity, reducing Z-axis recalibration
requirements by 30% compared to arc-trajectory grippers. The compact palm
architecture incorporates a kinematically optimized parallelogram linkage and
Differential mechanism, demonstrating adaptive grasping capabilities for
diverse industrial workpieces and deformable objects such as citrus fruits.
Future-ready interfaces are embedded for potential force/vision sensor
integration to facilitate multimodal data acquisition (e.g., trajectory
planning and object deformation) in digital twin frameworks. Designed as a
flexible manufacturing solution, SP-Diff advances robotic end-effector
intelligence through its adaptive architecture, showing promising applications
in collaborative robotics, logistics automation, and specialized operational
scenarios.

TL;DR: MoS-VLA是一个视觉-语言-动作模型框架，通过将机器人操作策略表示为有限学习基函数的线性组合，实现跨领域和具身的通用控制。该框架在预训练时学习结构化技能空间，测试时仅需单次专家演示即可通过轻量级凸优化快速适应新任务。

Motivation: 现有的视觉-语言-动作模型在新环境、新具身或新任务中往往无法直接使用，需要开发能够快速适应新场景的通用机器人控制方法。

Method: 提出混合技能VLA框架，将机器人操作策略表示为有限基函数的线性组合。预训练时在Open X-Embodiment数据集上联合学习基函数，测试时通过单次专家演示和L1动作误差最小化的凸优化推断技能表示，无需梯度更新。

Result: 在五个未见数据集上实现了更低的动作预测误差，在仿真和真实机器人任务中成功执行了预训练VLA模型完全失败的任务。

Conclusion: MoS-VLA通过结构化技能空间和轻量级优化实现了快速适应新任务的能力，为通用机器人控制提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models trained on large robot datasets promise
general-purpose, robust control across diverse domains and embodiments.
However, existing approaches often fail out-of-the-box when deployed in novel
environments, embodiments, or tasks. We introduce Mixture of Skills VLA
(MoS-VLA), a framework that represents robot manipulation policies as linear
combinations of a finite set of learned basis functions. During pretraining,
MoS-VLA jointly learns these basis functions across datasets from the Open
X-Embodiment project, producing a structured skill space. At test time,
adapting to a new task requires only a single expert demonstration. The
corresponding skill representation is then inferred via a lightweight convex
optimization problem that minimizes the L1 action error, without requiring
gradient updates. This gradient-free adaptation incurs minimal overhead while
enabling rapid instantiation of new skills. Empirically, MoS-VLA achieves lower
action-prediction error on five out of five unseen datasets and succeeds in
both simulation and real-robot tasks where a pretrained VLA model fails
outright. Project page: mos-vla.github.io/

Motivation: 了解急救人员对语义增强态势感知在机器人系统中应用的态度和需求，填补该领域跨国调查的空白。

Method: 对来自8个国家的22名急救人员进行结构化问卷调查，收集人口统计信息、对机器人的一般态度以及语义增强态势感知的体验。

Result: 大多数急救人员对机器人持积极态度，语义信息对态势感知的有用性平均评分为3.6/5，对预测紧急情况的有用性平均为3.9/5。参与者要求语义输出准确率达到74.6%才信任，67.8%才认为有用。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了实验室机器人能力与现场部署现实之间的关键差距，强调了急救人员与机器人研究人员之间更有意义的合作的必要性，有助于开发更符合用户需求和情境感知的应急响应机器人系统。

Abstract: This study investigates First Responders' (FRs) attitudes toward the use of
semantic information and Situational Awareness (SA) in robotic systems during
emergency operations. A structured questionnaire was administered to 22 FRs
across eight countries, capturing their demographic profiles, general attitudes
toward robots, and experiences with semantics-enhanced SA. Results show that
most FRs expressed positive attitudes toward robots, and rated the usefulness
of semantic information for building SA at an average of 3.6 out of 5. Semantic
information was also valued for its role in predicting unforeseen emergencies
(mean 3.9). Participants reported requiring an average of 74.6\% accuracy to
trust semantic outputs and 67.8\% for them to be considered useful, revealing a
willingness to use imperfect but informative AI support tools.
  To the best of our knowledge, this study offers novel insights by being one
of the first to directly survey FRs on semantic-based SA in a cross-national
context. It reveals the types of semantic information most valued in the field,
such as object identity, spatial relationships, and risk context-and connects
these preferences to the respondents' roles, experience, and education levels.
The findings also expose a critical gap between lab-based robotics capabilities
and the realities of field deployment, highlighting the need for more
meaningful collaboration between FRs and robotics researchers. These insights
contribute to the development of more user-aligned and situationally aware
robotic systems for emergency response.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of how excitation design
influences the identification of the inertia properties of rigid nano- and
micro-satellites. We simulate nonlinear attitude dynamics with reaction-wheel
coupling, actuator limits, and external disturbances, and excite the system
using eight torque profiles of varying spectral richness. Two estimators are
compared, a batch Least Squares method and an Extended Kalman Filter, across
three satellite configurations and time-varying inertia scenarios. Results show
that excitation frequency content and estimator assumptions jointly determine
estimation accuracy and robustness, offering practical guidance for in-orbit
adaptive inertia identification by outlining the conditions under which each
method performs best. The code is provided as open-source .

Abstract: State estimation is crucial for legged robots as it directly affects control
performance and locomotion stability. In this paper, we propose an Adaptive
Invariant Extended Kalman Filter to improve proprioceptive state estimation for
legged robots. The proposed method adaptively adjusts the noise level of the
contact foot model based on online covariance estimation, leading to improved
state estimation under varying contact conditions. It effectively handles small
slips that traditional slip rejection fails to address, as overly sensitive
slip rejection settings risk causing filter divergence. Our approach employs a
contact detection algorithm instead of contact sensors, reducing the reliance
on additional hardware. The proposed method is validated through real-world
experiments on the quadruped robot LeoQuad, demonstrating enhanced state
estimation performance in dynamic locomotion scenarios.

Conclusion: T3 Planner框架成功解决了自然语言指令到可执行运动计划的转换问题，通过形式化方法确保运动计划的可行性。

Abstract: Translating natural language instructions into executable motion plans is a
fundamental challenge in robotics. Traditional approaches are typically
constrained by their reliance on domain-specific expertise to customize
planners, and often struggle with spatio-temporal couplings that usually lead
to infeasible motions or discrepancies between task planning and motion
execution. Despite the proficiency of Large Language Models (LLMs) in
high-level semantic reasoning, hallucination could result in infeasible motion
plans. In this paper, we introduce the T3 Planner, an LLM-enabled robotic
motion planning framework that self-corrects it output with formal methods. The
framework decomposes spatio-temporal task constraints via three cascaded
modules, each of which stimulates an LLM to generate candidate trajectory
sequences and examines their feasibility via a Signal Temporal Logic (STL)
verifier until one that satisfies complex spatial, temporal, and logical
constraints is found.Experiments across different scenarios show that T3
Planner significantly outperforms the baselines. The required reasoning can be
distilled into a lightweight Qwen3-4B model that enables efficient deployment.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的轨迹采样方法C-Free-Uniform，该方法通过考虑局部地图信息来均匀采样自由配置空间，并将其集成到MPPI控制器中，在复杂导航任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的轨迹采样机制中控制输入分布p(u|x)与环境无关，这限制了在复杂环境中的导航性能。需要一种能够考虑环境信息的采样方法来提高导航成功率。

Method: 引入了自由配置空间均匀性(C-Free-Uniform)概念，生成考虑当前局部地图的控制输入分布，并将其集成到新的模型预测路径积分(MPPI)控制器CFU-MPPI中。

Result: 实验表明CFU-MPPI在杂乱多边形环境的挑战性导航任务中，相比现有方法具有更高的成功率，且需要更小的采样预算。

Conclusion: C-Free-Uniform采样方法通过显式考虑环境信息，显著提高了基于采样的控制机制在复杂导航任务中的性能。

Abstract: Trajectory sampling is a key component of sampling-based control mechanisms.
Trajectory samplers rely on control input samplers, which generate control
inputs u from a distribution p(u | x) where x is the current state. We
introduce the notion of Free Configuration Space Uniformity (C-Free-Uniform for
short) which has two key features: (i) it generates a control input
distribution so as to uniformly sample the free configuration space, and (ii)
in contrast to previously introduced trajectory sampling mechanisms where the
distribution p(u | x) is independent of the environment, C-Free-Uniform is
explicitly conditioned on the current local map. Next, we integrate this
sampler into a new Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) Controller, CFU-MPPI.
Experiments show that CFU-MPPI outperforms existing methods in terms of success
rate in challenging navigation tasks in cluttered polygonal environments while
requiring a much smaller sampling budget.

Abstract: This paper addresses the scarcity of affordable, fully-actuated five-fingered
hands for dexterous teleoperation, which is crucial for collecting large-scale
real-robot data within the "Learning from Demonstrations" paradigm. We
introduce the prototype version of the RAPID Hand, the first low-cost,
20-degree-of-actuation (DoA) dexterous hand that integrates a novel
anthropomorphic actuation and transmission scheme with an optimized motor
layout and structural design to enhance dexterity. Specifically, the RAPID Hand
features a universal phalangeal transmission scheme for the non-thumb fingers
and an omnidirectional thumb actuation mechanism. Prioritizing affordability,
the hand employs 3D-printed parts combined with custom gears for easier
replacement and repair. We assess the RAPID Hand's performance through
quantitative metrics and qualitative testing in a dexterous teleoperation
system, which is evaluated on three challenging tasks: multi-finger retrieval,
ladle handling, and human-like piano playing. The results indicate that the
RAPID Hand's fully actuated 20-DoF design holds significant promise for

Conclusion: 多模态目标条件架构在导管导航中具有可行性，是减少操作者依赖性和提高导管治疗可靠性的重要一步。

Abstract: Cardiac catheterization remains a cornerstone of minimally invasive
interventions, yet it continues to rely heavily on manual operation. Despite
advances in robotic platforms, existing systems are predominantly follow-leader
in nature, requiring continuous physician input and lacking intelligent
autonomy. This dependency contributes to operator fatigue, more radiation
exposure, and variability in procedural outcomes. This work moves towards
autonomous catheter navigation by introducing DINO-CVA, a multimodal
goal-conditioned behavior cloning framework. The proposed model fuses visual
observations and joystick kinematics into a joint embedding space, enabling
policies that are both vision-aware and kinematic-aware. Actions are predicted
autoregressively from expert demonstrations, with goal conditioning guiding
navigation toward specified destinations. A robotic experimental setup with a
synthetic vascular phantom was designed to collect multimodal datasets and
evaluate performance. Results show that DINO-CVA achieves high accuracy in
predicting actions, matching the performance of a kinematics-only baseline
while additionally grounding predictions in the anatomical environment. These
findings establish the feasibility of multimodal, goal-conditioned
architectures for catheter navigation, representing an important step toward
reducing operator dependency and improving the reliability of catheterbased
therapies.

Result: 优化的软体机械手在仿真和硬件实验中，对多样化挑战性物体的抓取成功率显著优于基准设计。

Abstract: Soft robotic hands promise to provide compliant and safe interaction with
objects and environments. However, designing soft hands to be both compliant
and functional across diverse use cases remains challenging. Although co-design
of hardware and control better couples morphology to behavior, the resulting
search space is high-dimensional, and even simulation-based evaluation is
computationally expensive. In this paper, we propose a Cross-Entropy Method
with Reward Model (CEM-RM) framework that efficiently optimizes tendon-driven
soft robotic hands based on teleoperation control policy, reducing design
evaluations by more than half compared to pure optimization while learning a
distribution of optimized hand designs from pre-collected teleoperation data.
We derive a design space for a soft robotic hand composed of flexural soft
fingers and implement parallelized training in simulation. The optimized hands
are then 3D-printed and deployed in the real world using both teleoperation
data and real-time teleoperation. Experiments in both simulation and hardware
demonstrate that our optimized design significantly outperforms baseline hands
in grasping success rates across a diverse set of challenging objects.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models extend vision-language models to embodied
control by mapping natural-language instructions and visual observations to
robot actions. Despite their capabilities, VLA systems face significant
challenges due to their massive computational and memory demands, which
conflict with the constraints of edge platforms such as on-board mobile
manipulators that require real-time performance. Addressing this tension has
become a central focus of recent research. In light of the growing efforts
toward more efficient and scalable VLA systems, this survey provides a
systematic review of approaches for improving VLA efficiency, with an emphasis
on reducing latency, memory footprint, and training and inference costs. We
categorize existing solutions into four dimensions: model architecture,
perception feature, action generation, and training/inference strategies,
summarizing representative techniques within each category. Finally, we discuss
future trends and open challenges, highlighting directions for advancing
efficient embodied intelligence.

Abstract: Existing approaches for transporting and manipulating cable-suspended loads
using multiple UAVs along reference trajectories typically rely on either
centralized control architectures or reliable inter-agent communication. In
this work, we propose a novel machine learning based method for decentralized
kinodynamic planning that operates effectively under partial observability and
without inter-agent communication. Our method leverages imitation learning to
train a decentralized student policy for each UAV by imitating a centralized
kinodynamic motion planner with access to privileged global observations. The
student policy generates smooth trajectories using physics-informed neural
networks that respect the derivative relationships in motion. During training,
the student policies utilize the full trajectory generated by the teacher
policy, leading to improved sample efficiency. Moreover, each student policy
can be trained in under two hours on a standard laptop. We validate our method
in both simulation and real-world environments to follow an agile reference
trajectory, demonstrating performance comparable to that of centralized
approaches.

Conclusion: DiffVLA++成功整合了VLA的认知推理能力和E2E的物理可行性，通过度量引导对齐实现了更好的自动驾驶性能。

Abstract: Conventional end-to-end (E2E) driving models are effective at generating
physically plausible trajectories, but often fail to generalize to long-tail
scenarios due to the lack of essential world knowledge to understand and reason
about surrounding environments. In contrast, Vision-Language-Action (VLA)
models leverage world knowledge to handle challenging cases, but their limited
3D reasoning capability can lead to physically infeasible actions. In this work
we introduce DiffVLA++, an enhanced autonomous driving framework that
explicitly bridges cognitive reasoning and E2E planning through metric-guided
alignment. First, we build a VLA module directly generating semantically
grounded driving trajectories. Second, we design an E2E module with a dense
trajectory vocabulary that ensures physical feasibility. Third, and most
critically, we introduce a metric-guided trajectory scorer that guides and
aligns the outputs of the VLA and E2E modules, thereby integrating their
complementary strengths. The experiment on the ICCV 2025 Autonomous Grand
Challenge leaderboard shows that DiffVLA++ achieves EPDMS of 49.12.

Motivation: 传统可变阻抗控制器在物理交互中具有优势，但缺乏在未见、复杂和非结构化安全交互场景中的泛化能力，特别是在涉及接触或不确定性的通用任务场景中。

Method: 使用自改进的检索增强生成(RAG)和上下文学习(ICL)，RAG从结构化记忆库中检索相关先验经验，ICL利用检索到的示例和当前任务提示查询VLM，生成上下文感知的自适应阻抗参数，并通过实时力/力矩反馈确保交互力在安全阈值内。

Conclusion: OmniVIC在连接高层语义推理和低层顺应控制方面迈出了一步，实现了更安全和更可泛化的操作。

Abstract: We present OmniVIC, a universal variable impedance controller (VIC) enhanced
by a vision language model (VLM), which improves safety and adaptation in any
contact-rich robotic manipulation task to enhance safe physical interaction.
Traditional VIC have shown advantages when the robot physically interacts with
the environment, but lack generalization in unseen, complex, and unstructured
safe interactions in universal task scenarios involving contact or uncertainty.
To this end, the proposed OmniVIC interprets task context derived reasoning
from images and natural language and generates adaptive impedance parameters
for a VIC controller. Specifically, the core of OmniVIC is a self-improving
Retrieval-Augmented Generation(RAG) and in-context learning (ICL), where RAG
retrieves relevant prior experiences from a structured memory bank to inform
the controller about similar past tasks, and ICL leverages these retrieved
examples and the prompt of current task to query the VLM for generating
context-aware and adaptive impedance parameters for the current manipulation
scenario. Therefore, a self-improved RAG and ICL guarantee OmniVIC works in
universal task scenarios. The impedance parameter regulation is further
informed by real-time force/torque feedback to ensure interaction forces remain
within safe thresholds. We demonstrate that our method outperforms baselines on
a suite of complex contact-rich tasks, both in simulation and on real-world
robotic tasks, with improved success rates and reduced force violations.
OmniVIC takes a step towards bridging high-level semantic reasoning and
low-level compliant control, enabling safer and more generalizable
manipulation. Overall, the average success rate increases from 27% (baseline)
to 61.4% (OmniVIC).

Abstract: Event cameras, featuring high temporal resolution and high dynamic range,
offer visual sensing capabilities comparable to conventional image sensors
while capturing fast-moving objects and handling scenes with extreme lighting
contrasts such as tunnel exits. Leveraging these properties, this study
proposes a novel self-localization system that integrates visible light
communication (VLC) and visible light positioning (VLP) within a single event
camera. The system enables a vehicle to estimate its position even in
GPS-denied environments, such as tunnels, by using VLC to obtain coordinate
information from LED transmitters and VLP to estimate the distance to each
transmitter.
  Multiple LEDs are installed on the transmitter side, each assigned a unique
pilot sequence based on Walsh-Hadamard codes. The event camera identifies
individual LEDs within its field of view by correlating the received signal
with these codes, allowing clear separation and recognition of each light
source. This mechanism enables simultaneous high-capacity MISO (multi-input
single-output) communication through VLC and precise distance estimation via
phase-only correlation (POC) between multiple LED pairs.
  To the best of our knowledge, this is the first vehicle-mounted system to
achieve simultaneous VLC and VLP functionalities using a single event camera.
Field experiments were conducted by mounting the system on a vehicle traveling
at 30 km/h (8.3 m/s). The results demonstrated robust real-world performance,
with a root mean square error (RMSE) of distance estimation within 0.75 m for
ranges up to 100 m and a bit error rate (BER) below 0.01 across the same range.

Abstract: Long-term autonomy for mobile robots requires both robust self-localization
and reliable map maintenance. Conventional landmark-based methods face a
fundamental trade-off between landmarks with high detectability but low
distinctiveness (e.g., poles) and those with high distinctiveness but difficult
stable detection (e.g., local point cloud structures). This work addresses the
challenge of descriptively identifying a unique "signature" (local point cloud)
by leveraging a detectable, high-precision "anchor" (like a pole). To solve
this, we propose a novel canonical representation, "Pole-Image," as a hybrid
method that uses poles as anchors to generate signatures from the surrounding
3D structure. Pole-Image represents a pole-like landmark and its surrounding
environment, detected from a LiDAR point cloud, as a 2D polar coordinate image
with the pole itself as the origin. This representation leverages the pole's
nature as a high-precision reference point, explicitly encoding the "relative
geometry" between the stable pole and the variable surrounding point cloud. The
key advantage of pole landmarks is that "detection" is extremely easy. This
ease of detection allows the robot to easily track the same pole, enabling the
automatic and large-scale collection of diverse observational data (positive
pairs). This data acquisition feasibility makes "Contrastive Learning (CL)"
applicable. By applying CL, the model learns a viewpoint-invariant and highly
discriminative descriptor. The contributions are twofold: 1) The descriptor
overcomes perceptual aliasing, enabling robust self-localization. 2) The
high-precision encoding enables high-sensitivity change detection, contributing
to map maintenance.

Abstract: Planetary exploration missions require robots capable of navigating extreme
and unknown environments. While wheeled rovers have dominated past missions,
their mobility is limited to traversable surfaces. Legged robots, especially
quadrupeds, can overcome these limitations by handling uneven, obstacle-rich,
and deformable terrains. However, deploying such robots in unknown conditions
is challenging due to the need for environment-specific control, which is
infeasible when terrain and robot parameters are uncertain. This work presents
a modular control framework that combines model-based dynamic control with
online model adaptation and adaptive footstep planning to address uncertainties
in both robot and terrain properties. The framework includes state estimation
for quadrupeds with and without contact sensing, supports runtime
reconfiguration, and is integrated into ROS 2 with open-source availability.
Its performance was validated on two quadruped platforms, multiple hardware
architectures, and in a volcano field test, where the robot walked over 700 m.

Abstract: The reliable execution of high-level missions in multi-robot systems with
heterogeneous agents, requires robust methods for detecting spurious behaviors.
In this paper, we address the challenge of identifying spurious executions of
plans specified as a Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) formula, as incorrect task
sequences, violations of spatial constraints, timing inconsis- tencies, or
deviations from intended mission semantics. To tackle this, we introduce a
structured data generation framework based on the Nets-within-Nets (NWN)
paradigm, which coordinates robot actions with LTL-derived global mission
specifications. We further propose a Transformer-based anomaly detection
pipeline that classifies robot trajectories as normal or anomalous. Experi-
mental evaluations show that our method achieves high accuracy (91.3%) in
identifying execution inefficiencies, and demonstrates robust detection
capabilities for core mission violations (88.3%) and constraint-based adaptive
anomalies (66.8%). An ablation experiment of the embedding and architecture was
carried out, obtaining successful results where our novel proposition performs
better than simpler representations.

Result: 在多个四足机器人和人形机器人数据集上的实验表明，FeLaN在仿真和真实机器人上都实现了高度竞争力的性能。

Conclusion: FeLaN不仅提供了更好的物理可解释性，还在保持物理约束的同时实现了优异的系统识别性能。

Abstract: Grey-box methods for system identification combine deep learning with
physics-informed constraints, capturing complex dependencies while improving
out-of-distribution generalization. Yet, despite the growing importance of
floating-base systems such as humanoids and quadrupeds, current grey-box models
ignore their specific physical constraints. For instance, the inertia matrix is
not only positive definite but also exhibits branch-induced sparsity and input
independence. Moreover, the 6x6 composite spatial inertia of the floating base
inherits properties of single-rigid-body inertia matrices. As we show, this
includes the triangle inequality on the eigenvalues of the composite rotational
inertia. To address the lack of physical consistency in deep learning models of
floating-base systems, we introduce a parameterization of inertia matrices that
satisfies all these constraints. Inspired by Deep Lagrangian Networks (DeLaN),
we train neural networks to predict physically plausible inertia matrices that
minimize inverse dynamics error under Lagrangian mechanics. For evaluation, we
collected and released a dataset on multiple quadrupeds and humanoids. In these
experiments, our Floating-Base Deep Lagrangian Networks (FeLaN) achieve highly
competitive performance on both simulated and real robots, while providing
greater physical interpretability.

Conclusion: 该框架推进了基于视频的决策领域，能够动态适应而无需显式建模未知状态变量。

Abstract: Video-based representations have gained prominence in planning and
decision-making due to their ability to encode rich spatiotemporal dynamics and
geometric relationships. These representations enable flexible and
generalizable solutions for complex tasks such as object manipulation and
navigation. However, existing video planning frameworks often struggle to adapt
to failures at interaction time due to their inability to reason about
uncertainties in partially observed environments. To overcome these
limitations, we introduce a novel framework that integrates interaction-time
data into the planning process. Our approach updates model parameters online
and filters out previously failed plans during generation. This enables
implicit state estimation, allowing the system to adapt dynamically without
explicitly modeling unknown state variables. We evaluate our framework through
extensive experiments on a new simulated manipulation benchmark, demonstrating
its ability to improve replanning performance and advance the field of
video-based decision-making.

Abstract: Automating the manipulation of granular materials poses significant
challenges due to complex contact dynamics, unpredictable material properties,
and intricate system states. Existing approaches often fail to achieve
efficiency and accuracy in such tasks. To fill the research gap, this paper
studies the small-scale and high-precision granular material digging task with
unknown physical properties. A new framework, named differentiable digging
robot (DDBot), is proposed to manipulate granular materials, including sand and
soil.
  Specifically, we equip DDBot with a differentiable physics-based simulator,
tailored for granular material manipulation, powered by GPU-accelerated
parallel computing and automatic differentiation. DDBot can perform efficient
differentiable system identification and high-precision digging skill
optimisation for unknown granular materials, which is enabled by a
differentiable skill-to-action mapping, a task-oriented demonstration method,
gradient clipping and line search-based gradient descent.
  Experimental results show that DDBot can efficiently (converge within 5 to 20
minutes) identify unknown granular material dynamics and optimise digging
skills, with high-precision results in zero-shot real-world deployments,
highlighting its practicality. Benchmark results against state-of-the-art
baselines also confirm the robustness and efficiency of DDBot in such digging
tasks.

Result: IFIC框架能够适应交互功率流，确保在接触丰富环境中的轻松安全交互。

Conclusion: 所提出的控制架构通过端口哈密顿框架保证了系统被动性，为接触丰富环境中的机器人-人类协作提供了安全解决方案。

Abstract: Human collaboration with robots requires flexible role adaptation, enabling
robot to switch between active leader and passive follower. Effective role
switching depends on accurately estimating human intention, which is typically
achieved through external force analysis, nominal robot dynamics, or
data-driven approaches. However, these methods are primarily effective in
contact-sparse environments. When robots under hybrid or unified
force-impedance control physically interact with active humans or non-passive
environments, the robotic system may lose passivity and thus compromise safety.
To address this challenge, this paper proposes the unified Interactive
Force-Impedance Control (IFIC) framework that adapts to the interaction power
flow, ensuring effortless and safe interaction in contact-rich environments.
The proposed control architecture is formulated within a port-Hamiltonian
framework, incorporating both interaction and task control ports, through which
system passivity is guaranteed.

Abstract: Robotic systems are increasingly expected to operate in human-centered,
unstructured environments where safety, adaptability, and generalization are
essential. Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have been proposed as a language
guided generalized control framework for real robots. However, their deployment
has been limited to conventional serial link manipulators. Coupled by their
rigidity and unpredictability of learning based control, the ability to safely
interact with the environment is missing yet critical. In this work, we present
the deployment of a VLA model on a soft continuum manipulator to demonstrate
autonomous safe human-robot interaction. We present a structured finetuning and
deployment pipeline evaluating two state-of-the-art VLA models (OpenVLA-OFT and
$\pi_0$) across representative manipulation tasks, and show while
out-of-the-box policies fail due to embodiment mismatch, through targeted
finetuning the soft robot performs equally to the rigid counterpart. Our
findings highlight the necessity of finetuning for bridging embodiment gaps,
and demonstrate that coupling VLA models with soft robots enables safe and
flexible embodied AI in human-shared environments.

TL;DR: FALCON提出了一种新的范式，通过将丰富的3D空间标记注入动作头来解决现有视觉-语言-动作模型在空间推理方面的局限性，无需重新训练即可融合深度或姿态信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉-语言-动作模型基于2D编码器，存在空间推理差距，限制了泛化能力和适应性。现有的3D集成技术要么需要专用传感器且跨模态迁移能力差，要么注入的线索缺乏几何信息并损害视觉-语言对齐。

Method: FALCON利用空间基础模型从RGB图像中提取强几何先验，包含一个可选的具身空间模型来融合深度或姿态信息。空间标记由空间增强动作头处理，而不是串联到视觉-语言主干中，以保持语言推理能力。

Result: 在三个模拟基准和十一个现实世界任务中的综合评估显示，FALCON实现了最先进的性能，持续超越竞争基线，并在杂乱环境、空间提示条件以及物体尺度和高度变化下保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: FALCON通过创新的空间标记注入方法有效解决了空间表示、模态可迁移性和对齐方面的限制，为视觉-语言-动作模型提供了更强的空间推理能力。

Abstract: Existing vision-language-action (VLA) models act in 3D real-world but are
typically built on 2D encoders, leaving a spatial reasoning gap that limits
generalization and adaptability. Recent 3D integration techniques for VLAs
either require specialized sensors and transfer poorly across modalities, or
inject weak cues that lack geometry and degrade vision-language alignment. In
this work, we introduce FALCON (From Spatial to Action), a novel paradigm that
injects rich 3D spatial tokens into the action head. FALCON leverages spatial
foundation models to deliver strong geometric priors from RGB alone, and
includes an Embodied Spatial Model that can optionally fuse depth, or pose for
higher fidelity when available, without retraining or architectural changes. To
preserve language reasoning, spatial tokens are consumed by a Spatial-Enhanced
Action Head rather than being concatenated into the vision-language backbone.
These designs enable FALCON to address limitations in spatial representation,
modality transferability, and alignment. In comprehensive evaluations across
three simulation benchmarks and eleven real-world tasks, our proposed FALCON
achieves state-of-the-art performance, consistently surpasses competitive
baselines, and remains robust under clutter, spatial-prompt conditioning, and
variations in object scale and height.

Conclusion: 该理论适用于所有可反馈线性化的非线性系统，如机器人、空中和地面车辆等，并通过机器人操纵器的数值仿真验证了有效性。

Abstract: This letter presents a systematic framework for switching between different
sets of outputs for the control of nonlinear systems via feedback
linearization. We introduce the concept of a meld to formally define a valid,
feedback-linearizable subset of outputs that can be selected from a larger deck
of possible outputs. The main contribution is a formal proof establishing that
under suitable dwell-time and compatibility conditions, it is possible to
switch between different melds while guaranteeing the uniform boundedness of
the system state. We further show that the error dynamics of the active outputs
remain exponentially stable within each switching interval and that outputs
common to consecutive melds are tracked seamlessly through transitions. The
proposed theory is valid for any feedback linearizable nonlinear system, such
as, e.g., robots, aerial and terrestrial vehicles, etc.. We demonstrate it on a
simple numerical simulation of a robotic manipulator.

Abstract: Safe and efficient robotic navigation among humans is essential for
integrating robots into everyday environments. Most existing approaches focus
on simplified 2D crowd navigation and fail to account for the full complexity
of human body dynamics beyond root motion. We present HumanMPC, a Model
Predictive Control (MPC) framework for 3D Micro Air Vehicle (MAV) navigation
among humans that combines theoretical safety guarantees with data-driven
models for realistic human motion forecasting. Our approach introduces a novel
twist to reachability-based safety formulation that constrains only the initial
control input for safety while modeling its effects over the entire planning
horizon, enabling safe yet efficient navigation. We validate HumanMPC in both
simulated experiments using real human trajectories and in the real-world,
demonstrating its effectiveness across tasks ranging from goal-directed
navigation to visual servoing for human tracking. While we apply our method to
MAVs in this work, it is generic and can be adapted by other platforms. Our
results show that the method ensures safety without excessive conservatism and
outperforms baseline approaches in both efficiency and reliability.

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效解决大规模无人机群的轨迹优化问题，通过分布式计算和自适应参数调整提高了算法效率。

Abstract: Swarm trajectory optimization problems are a well-recognized class of
multi-agent optimal control problems with strong nonlinearity. However, the
heuristic nature of needing to set the final time for agents beforehand and the
time-consuming limitation of the significant number of iterations prohibit the
application of existing methods to large-scale swarm of Unmanned Aerial
Vehicles (UAVs) in practice. In this paper, we propose a spatial-temporal
trajectory optimization framework that accomplishes multi-UAV consensus based
on the Alternating Direction Multiplier Method (ADMM) and uses Differential
Dynamic Programming (DDP) for fast local planning of individual UAVs. The
introduced framework is a two-level architecture that employs Parameterized DDP
(PDDP) as the trajectory optimizer for each UAV, and ADMM to satisfy the local
constraints and accomplish the spatial-temporal parameter consensus among all
UAVs. This results in a fully distributed algorithm called Distributed
Parameterized DDP (D-PDDP). In addition, an adaptive tuning criterion based on
the spectral gradient method for the penalty parameter is proposed to reduce
the number of algorithmic iterations. Several simulation examples are presented
to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of planning complex manipulation tasks, in
which multiple robots with different end-effectors and capabilities, informed
by computer vision, must plan and execute concatenated sequences of actions on
a variety of objects that can appear in arbitrary positions and configurations
in unstructured scenes. We propose an intent-driven planning pipeline which can
robustly construct such action sequences with varying degrees of supervisory
input from a human using simple language instructions. The pipeline integrates:
(i) perception-to-text scene encoding, (ii) an ensemble of large language
models (LLMs) that generate candidate removal sequences based on the operator's
intent, (iii) an LLM-based verifier that enforces formatting and precedence
constraints, and (iv) a deterministic consistency filter that rejects
hallucinated objects. The pipeline is evaluated on an example task in which two
robot arms work collaboratively to dismantle an Electric Vehicle battery for
recycling applications. A variety of components must be grasped and removed in
specific sequences, determined by human instructions and/or by task-order
feasibility decisions made by the autonomous system. On 200 real scenes with
600 operator prompts across five component classes, we used metrics of
full-sequence correctness and next-task correctness to evaluate and compare
five LLM-based planners (including ablation analyses of pipeline components).
We also evaluated the LLM-based human interface in terms of time to execution
and NASA TLX with human participant experiments. Results indicate that our
ensemble-with-verification approach reliably maps operator intent to safe,
executable multi-robot plans while maintaining low user effort.

Abstract: With the rapid growth of bike sharing and the increasing diversity of cycling
applications, accurate bicycle localization has become essential. traditional
GNSS-based methods suffer from multipath effects, while existing inertial
navigation approaches rely on precise modeling and show limited robustness.
Tight Learned Inertial Odometry (TLIO) achieves low position drift by combining
raw IMU data with predicted displacements by neural networks, but its high
computational cost restricts deployment on mobile devices. To overcome this, we
extend TLIO to bicycle localization and introduce an improved Mixture-of

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模仿学习数据集只包含成功轨迹，缺乏失败和恢复数据，导致VLA模型在处理偏离训练分布的OOD状态时表现不佳。

Method: 利用离线强化学习获取动作价值网络识别次优动作，通过rollout采样潜在OOD状态，设计探索性采样机制将动作代理自适应纳入训练数据集。

Result: 在LIBERO基准测试和真实机器人操作任务中，RESample持续提升了VLA模型的稳定性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: RESample框架有效增强了VLA模型从OOD状态恢复的能力，提高了对抗分布偏移的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) have demonstrated remarkable performance
on complex robotic manipulation tasks through imitation learning. However,
existing imitation learning datasets contain only successful trajectories and
lack failure or recovery data, especially for out-of-distribution (OOD) states
where the robot deviates from the main policy due to minor perturbations or
errors, leading VLA models to struggle with states deviating from the training
distribution. To this end, we propose an automated OOD data augmentation
framework named RESample through exploratory sampling. Specifically, we first
leverage offline reinforcement learning to obtain an action-value network that
accurately identifies sub-optimal actions under the current manipulation
policy. We further sample potential OOD states from trajectories via rollout,
and design an exploratory sampling mechanism that adaptively incorporates these
action proxies into the training dataset to ensure efficiency. Subsequently,
our framework explicitly encourages the VLAs to recover from OOD states and
enhances their robustness against distributional shifts. We conduct extensive
experiments on the LIBERO benchmark as well as real-world robotic manipulation
tasks, demonstrating that RESample consistently improves the stability and
generalization ability of VLA models.

TL;DR: SoftMimic是一个从示例动作学习人形机器人柔顺全身控制策略的框架，通过奖励策略匹配柔顺响应而非刚性跟踪参考动作，使机器人能够顺应外力同时保持平衡和姿态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习方法激励僵硬控制，当机器人遇到意外接触时会导致脆弱和不安全行为，需要开发能够顺应外力响应的控制策略。

Method: 利用逆运动学求解器生成可行的柔顺动作增强数据集，训练强化学习策略奖励匹配柔顺响应而非刚性跟踪参考动作。

Result: 通过仿真和真实世界实验验证，展示了与环境的安���有效交互，能够吸收干扰并从单个动作片段泛化到各种任务。

Conclusion: SoftMimic框架能够学习柔顺的全身控制策略，使机器人能够顺应外力同时保持平衡，提高了在意外接触情况下的安全性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: We introduce SoftMimic, a framework for learning compliant whole-body control
policies for humanoid robots from example motions. Imitating human motions with
reinforcement learning allows humanoids to quickly learn new skills, but
existing methods incentivize stiff control that aggressively corrects
deviations from a reference motion, leading to brittle and unsafe behavior when
the robot encounters unexpected contacts. In contrast, SoftMimic enables robots
to respond compliantly to external forces while maintaining balance and
posture. Our approach leverages an inverse kinematics solver to generate an
augmented dataset of feasible compliant motions, which we use to train a
reinforcement learning policy. By rewarding the policy for matching compliant
responses rather than rigidly tracking the reference motion, SoftMimic learns
to absorb disturbances and generalize to varied tasks from a single motion
clip. We validate our method through simulations and real-world experiments,
demonstrating safe and effective interaction with the environment.

TL;DR: 提出了RoboBench基准测试，系统评估多模态大语言模型作为具身大脑在机器人操作任务中的认知能力，涵盖5个维度、14种能力、25个任务和6092个问答对。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试主要关注执行成功率，或在高层次推理方面存在维度不完整和任务真实性有限的问题，无法全面评估认知能力。

Method: 构建RoboBench基准，定义五个维度：指令理解、感知推理、泛化规划、功能预测和失败分析，并引入MLLM-as-world-simulator评估框架来模拟预测计划的可行性。

Result: 对14个MLLM的实验揭示了基本局限性：在隐式指令理解、时空推理、跨场景规划、细粒度功能理解和执行失败诊断方面存在困难。

Conclusion: RoboBench为量化高层次认知能力提供了全面框架，将指导下一代具身MLLM的开发。

Abstract: Building robots that can perceive, reason, and act in dynamic, unstructured
environments remains a core challenge. Recent embodied systems often adopt a
dual-system paradigm, where System 2 handles high-level reasoning while System
1 executes low-level control. In this work, we refer to System 2 as the
embodied brain, emphasizing its role as the cognitive core for reasoning and
decision-making in manipulation tasks. Given this role, systematic evaluation
of the embodied brain is essential. Yet existing benchmarks emphasize execution
success, or when targeting high-level reasoning, suffer from incomplete
dimensions and limited task realism, offering only a partial picture of
cognitive capability. To bridge this gap, we introduce RoboBench, a benchmark
that systematically evaluates multimodal large language models (MLLMs) as
embodied brains. Motivated by the critical roles across the full manipulation
pipeline, RoboBench defines five dimensions-instruction comprehension,
perception reasoning, generalized planning, affordance prediction, and failure
analysis-spanning 14 capabilities, 25 tasks, and 6092 QA pairs. To ensure
realism, we curate datasets across diverse embodiments, attribute-rich objects,
and multi-view scenes, drawing from large-scale real robotic data. For
planning, RoboBench introduces an evaluation framework,
MLLM-as-world-simulator. It evaluate embodied feasibility by simulating whether
predicted plans can achieve critical object-state changes. Experiments on 14
MLLMs reveal fundamental limitations: difficulties with implicit instruction
comprehension, spatiotemporal reasoning, cross-scenario planning, fine-grained
affordance understanding, and execution failure diagnosis. RoboBench provides a
comprehensive scaffold to quantify high-level cognition, and guide the
development of next-generation embodied MLLMs. The project page is in

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Lean Finder是一个专为数学家和Lean用户设计的语义搜索引擎，通过理解用户意图和偏好，在定理搜索方面相比现有方法实现了30%以上的相对改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Lean搜索引擎主要依赖形式化语句的非正式翻译，但忽视了与实际用户查询的匹配问题，导致定理证明进展缓慢且学习曲线陡峭。

Method: 分析并聚类公开Lean讨论的语义，在模拟用户意图的合成查询上微调文本嵌入，并使用多样化反馈信号与数学家偏好对齐。

Result: 在真实世界查询、非正式化语句和证明状态评估中，相比先前搜索引擎和GPT-4o实现了超过30%的相对改进。

Conclusion: Lean Finder提供了用户中心的语义搜索，与基于LLM的定理证明器兼容，连接了检索与形式推理。

Abstract: We present Lean Finder, a semantic search engine for Lean and mathlib that
understands and aligns with the intents of mathematicians. Progress in formal
theorem proving is often hindered by the difficulty of locating relevant
theorems and the steep learning curve of the Lean 4 language, making
advancement slow and labor-intensive. Existing Lean search engines, though
helpful, rely primarily on informalizations (natural language translation of
the formal statements), while largely overlooking the mismatch with real-world
user queries. In contrast, we propose a user-centered semantic search tailored
to the needs of mathematicians. Our approach begins by analyzing and clustering
the semantics of public Lean discussions, then fine-tuning text embeddings on
synthesized queries that emulate user intents. We further align Lean Finder
with mathematicians' preferences using diverse feedback signals, encoding it
with a rich awareness of their goals from multiple perspectives. Evaluations on
real-world queries, informalized statements, and proof states demonstrate that
our Lean Finder achieves over $30\%$ relative improvement compared to previous
search engines and GPT-4o. In addition, Lean Finder is compatible with
LLM-based theorem provers, bridging retrieval with formal reasoning. Lean

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LS-OGD是一种新颖的自适应控制框架，用于在概念漂移存在的情况下实现鲁棒的多模态学习。它通过动态调整学习率和模态融合权重来应对数据分布变化，确保系统在概念漂移下的稳定性和容错能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态学习系统在非平稳环境中容易受到概念漂移的影响，导致性能下降。特别是模态特定的漂移和缺乏连续稳定适应机制的问题亟待解决。

Method: LS-OGD采用在线控制器，根据检测到的漂移和预测误差动态调整模型的学习率和不同数据模态之间的融合权重。

Result: 在有限漂移条件下，LS-OGD系统的预测误差被证明是均匀最终有界的，如果漂移停止则会收敛到零。自适应融合策略能有效隔离和减轻严重模态特定漂移的影响。

Conclusion: 这些理论保证为开发可靠且持续自适应的多模态学习系统建立了原则性基础，确保了系统的弹性和容错能力。

Abstract: Multimodal learning systems often struggle in non-stationary environments due
to concept drift, where changing data distributions can degrade performance.
Modality-specific drifts and the lack of mechanisms for continuous, stable
adaptation compound this challenge. This paper introduces LS-OGD, a novel
adaptive control framework for robust multimodal learning in the presence of
concept drift. LS-OGD uses an online controller that dynamically adjusts the
model's learning rate and the fusion weights between different data modalities
in response to detected drift and evolving prediction errors. We prove that
under bounded drift conditions, the LS-OGD system's prediction error is
uniformly ultimately bounded and converges to zero if the drift ceases.
Additionally, we demonstrate that the adaptive fusion strategy effectively
isolates and mitigates the impact of severe modality-specific drift, thereby
ensuring system resilience and fault tolerance. These theoretical guarantees
establish a principled foundation for developing reliable and continuously
adapting multimodal learning systems.

TL;DR: BEACON是一个基于贝叶斯学习的自适应采样框架，通过实时更新奖励分布的后验信念来决定何时停止生成新样本，在保持响应质量的同时显著减少采样次数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多响应采样能提高LLM输出质量，但计算成本高昂。关键挑战是如何平衡准确率提升与效率，决定何时停止生成新样本。

Method: 基于序列搜索与贝叶斯学习，BEACON顺序生成响应、实时更新奖励分布后验信念，当进一步探索的边际效用不再值得计算成本时停止采样。

Result: BEACON平均减少80%的采样量，同时保持响应质量，在成本高效的偏好数据生成中表现优异。

Conclusion: BEACON提供了理论最优性保证和实际可操作性，为未来研究者提供了实用的自适应采样解决方案。

Abstract: Sampling multiple responses is a common way to improve LLM output quality,
but it comes at the cost of additional computation. The key challenge is
deciding when to stop generating new samples to balance accuracy gains against
efficiency. To address this, we introduce BEACON (Bayesian Efficient Adaptive
Criterion for Optimal N-stopping), a principled adaptive sampling framework
grounded in Sequential Search with Bayesian Learning. BEACON sequentially
generates responses from the policy LLM, updates posterior belief over reward
distributions in real time without further training, and determines when to
stop by weighing expected gains against computational cost. Sampling terminates
once the marginal utility of further exploration no longer justifies the
expense. We establish both theoretical optimality guarantees and practical
tractability, and show empirically that BEACON reduces average sampling by up
to 80% while maintaining response quality. We further demonstrate BEACON's
utility for cost-efficient preference data generation and outline practical
extensions, offering actionable insights for future researchers.

TL;DR: PatMD是一种新颖的有害表情包检测方法，通过学习和主动缓解潜在的误判风险来提高检测性能。它构建误判风险模式知识库，动态指导多模态大语言模型避免已知误判陷阱。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有检测方法（包括MLLM技术）在处理表情包中通过讽刺、隐喻等修辞手法表达的隐含有害内容时经常误判，需要超越表面内容匹配来识别潜在的误判风险模式。

Method: 首先构建知识库，将每个表情包解构为误判风险模式，解释其可能被误判的原因（漏判有害内容或误判良性内容）。对于目标表情包，检索相关模式并动态指导MLLM推理。

Result: 在5个有害检测任务的6,626个表情包基准测试中，PatMD优于最先进基线方法，F1分数平均提高8.30%，准确率平均提高7.71%。

Conclusion: PatMD展示了强大的泛化能力和改进的有害表情包检测能力，通过主动缓解误判风险有效提升了检测性能。

Abstract: Internet memes have emerged as a popular multimodal medium, yet they are
increasingly weaponized to convey harmful opinions through subtle rhetorical
devices like irony and metaphor. Existing detection approaches, including
MLLM-based techniques, struggle with these implicit expressions, leading to
frequent misjudgments. This paper introduces PatMD, a novel approach that
improves harmful meme detection by learning from and proactively mitigating
these potential misjudgment risks. Our core idea is to move beyond superficial
content-level matching and instead identify the underlying misjudgment risk
patterns, proactively guiding the MLLMs to avoid known misjudgment pitfalls. We
first construct a knowledge base where each meme is deconstructed into a
misjudgment risk pattern explaining why it might be misjudged, either
overlooking harmful undertones (false negative) or overinterpreting benign
content (false positive). For a given target meme, PatMD retrieves relevant
patterns and utilizes them to dynamically guide the MLLM's reasoning.
Experiments on a benchmark of 6,626 memes across 5 harmful detection tasks show
that PatMD outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving an average of
8.30\% improvement in F1-score and 7.71\% improvement in accuracy,
demonstrating strong generalizability and improved detection capability of
harmful memes.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出基于WaveNet的深度学习模型，用于自动化分类EEG信号为生理、病理、伪影和噪声四类，在公开数据集上取得优于CNN和LSTM方法的分类准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于专家视觉审阅的EEG信号分类方法因EEG记录复杂性和数据量增加而变得不切实际，需要自动化解决方案。

Method: 使用WaveNet架构，利用扩张因果卷积和残差连接处理EEG数据，在Mayo Clinic和St. Anne's大学医院的公开数据集上进行训练验证测试，采用70/20/10的数据划分。

Result: 模型分类准确率超过之前的CNN和LSTM方法，能高精度区分噪声和伪影，但在生理和病理信号间存在可解释的误分类，反映了临床固有的重叠性。

Conclusion: WaveNet架构因其能捕捉细粒度和长程时间依赖关系，非常适合EEG数据分析，为EEG信号自动化分类提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: This study introduces a WaveNet-based deep learning model designed to
automate the classification of EEG signals into physiological, pathological,
artifact, and noise categories. Traditional methods for EEG signal
classification, which rely on expert visual review, are becoming increasingly
impractical due to the growing complexity and volume of EEG recordings.
Leveraging a publicly available annotated dataset from Mayo Clinic and St.
Anne's University Hospital, the WaveNet model was trained, validated, and
tested on 209,232 samples with a 70/20/10 percent split. The model achieved a
classification accuracy exceeding previous CNN and LSTM-based approaches, and
was benchmarked against a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) baseline.
Notably, the model distinguishes noise and artifacts with high precision,
although it reveals a modest but explainable degree of misclassification
between physiological and pathological signals, reflecting inherent clinical
overlap. WaveNet's architecture, originally developed for raw audio synthesis,
is well suited for EEG data due to its use of dilated causal convolutions and
residual connections, enabling it to capture both fine-grained and long-range
temporal dependencies. The research also details the preprocessing pipeline,
including dynamic dataset partitioning and normalization steps that support
model generalization.

Conclusion: 击键动力学可作为帕金森病的可靠数字生物标志物，为早期检测和持续监测提供了有前景的途径。

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) presents a growing global challenge, affecting over
10 million individuals, with prevalence expected to double by 2040. Early
diagnosis remains difficult due to the late emergence of motor symptoms and
limitations of traditional clinical assessments. In this study, we propose a
novel pipeline that leverages keystroke dynamics as a non-invasive and scalable
biomarker for remote PD screening and telemonitoring. Our methodology involves
three main stages: (i) preprocessing of data from four distinct datasets,
extracting four temporal signals and addressing class imbalance through the
comparison of three methods; (ii) pre-training eight state-of-the-art
deep-learning architectures on the two largest datasets, optimizing temporal
windowing, stride, and other hyperparameters; (iii) fine-tuning on an
intermediate-sized dataset and performing external validation on a fourth,
independent cohort. Our results demonstrate that hybrid convolutional-recurrent
and transformer-based models achieve strong external validation performance,
with AUC-ROC scores exceeding 90% and F1-Score over 70%. Notably, a temporal
convolutional model attains an AUC-ROC of 91.14% in external validation,
outperforming existing methods that rely solely on internal validation. These
findings underscore the potential of keystroke dynamics as a reliable digital
biomarker for PD, offering a promising avenue for early detection and
continuous monitoring.

Motivation: 随着野火破坏性增强且控制成本上升，需要准确、实时的火势蔓延预测来进行有效管理。数据同化通过整合遥感观测数据和数值模型预测，对提高野火预测准确性至关重要。

Method: 采用基于扩散模型的集成评分滤波器(EnSF)，利用基于评分的生成扩散模型来处理高维非线性滤波问题，特别适用于野火蔓延模型的滤波问题。

Result: 数值研究表明，EnSF在准确性、稳定性和计算效率方面表现优异，为野火数据同化提供了强大而实用的方法。

Conclusion: EnSF被确立为野火数据同化的稳健实用方法，其代码已公开可用。

Abstract: As wildfires become increasingly destructive and expensive to control,
effective management of active wildfires requires accurate, real-time fire
spread predictions. To enhance the forecasting accuracy of active fires, data
assimilation plays a vital role by integrating observations (such as
remote-sensing data) and fire predictions generated from numerical models. This
paper provides a comprehensive investigation on the application of a recently
proposed diffusion-model-based filtering algorithm -- the Ensemble Score Filter
(EnSF) -- to the data assimilation problem for real-time active wildfire spread
predictions. Leveraging a score-based generative diffusion model, EnSF has been
shown to have superior accuracy for high-dimensional nonlinear filtering
problems, making it an ideal candidate for the filtering problems of wildfire
spread models. Technical details are provided, and our numerical investigations
demonstrate that EnSF provides superior accuracy, stability, and computational
efficiency, establishing it as a robust and practical method for wildfire data
assimilation. Our code has been made publicly available.

TL;DR: LLMs处理工具返回的复杂JSON响应能力不足，研究发现JSON处理对前沿模型仍是挑战，不同处理策略性能差异可达3%-50%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实任务自动化需要LLMs调用工具并处理返回的复杂JSON响应，但LLMs处理结构化响应的能力研究不足。

Method: 创建了工具响应处理数据集，评估了15个开源和闭源模型，采用多种提示方法。

Result: JSON处理对前沿模型仍是困难任务，最佳处理策略取决于工具输出的性质和大小以及所需推理的复杂性。

Conclusion: 工具响应处理是LLMs的关键挑战，处理策略选择对性能有显著影响，需要根据具体场景优化。

Abstract: Most realistic task automation problems require large language models (LLMs)
to call tools, which often return complex JSON responses. These responses must
be further processed to derive the information necessary for task completion.
The ability of LLMs to do so is under-studied. In this paper, we study the tool
response processing task and LLMs' abilities to process structured (JSON)
responses. We created a dataset for this task, and evaluated 15 open and closed
weight models using multiple prompting approaches. Our results show that JSON
processing remains a difficult task even for frontier models across multiple
prompting strategies. The optimal response processing strategy depends on both
the nature and size of the tool outputs, as well as the complexity of the
required reasoning. Variations in processing approaches can lead to performance
differences ranging from 3\% to 50\%.

Abstract: This work contributes to advancing sustainable energy and waste management
strategies by investigating the thermochemical conversion of food-based biomass
through pyrolysis, highlighting the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in
enhancing process modelling accuracy and optimization efficiency. The main
objective is to explore the potential of underutilized biomass resources, such
as spent coffee grounds (SCG) and date seeds (DS), for sustainable hydrogen
production. Specifically, it aims to optimize the pyrolysis process while
evaluating the performance of these resources both individually and as blends.
Proximate, ultimate, fibre, TGA/DTG, kinetic, thermodynamic, and Py-Micro GC
analyses were conducted for pure DS, SCG, and blends (75% DS - 25% SCG, 50% DS
- 50% SCG, 25% DS - 75% SCG). Blend 3 offered superior hydrogen yield potential
but had the highest activation energy (Ea: 313.24 kJ/mol), while Blend 1
exhibited the best activation energy value (Ea: 161.75 kJ/mol). The kinetic
modelling based on isoconversional methods (KAS, FWO, Friedman) identified KAS
as the most accurate. These approaches provide a detailed understanding of the
pyrolysis process, with particular emphasis on the integration of artificial
intelligence. An LSTM model trained with lignocellulosic data predicted TGA
curves with exceptional accuracy (R^2: 0.9996-0.9998).

Conclusion: LAMI框架能有效检测青少年非法药物使用，并提供可解释的风险因素分析，为公共卫生干预提供支持

Abstract: Illicit drug use among teenagers and young adults (TYAs) remains a pressing
public health concern, with rising prevalence and long-term impacts on health
and well-being. To detect illicit drug use among TYAs, researchers analyze
large-scale surveys such as the Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) and the
National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), which preserve rich
demographic, psychological, and environmental factors related to substance use.
However, existing modeling methods treat survey variables independently,
overlooking latent and interconnected structures among them. To address this
limitation, we propose LAMI (LAtent relation Mining with bi-modal
Interpretability), a novel joint graph-language modeling framework for
detecting illicit drug use and interpreting behavioral risk factors among TYAs.
LAMI represents individual responses as relational graphs, learns latent
connections through a specialized graph structure learning layer, and
integrates a large language model to generate natural language explanations
grounded in both graph structures and survey semantics. Experiments on the YRBS
and NSDUH datasets show that LAMI outperforms competitive baselines in
predictive accuracy. Interpretability analyses further demonstrate that LAMI
reveals meaningful behavioral substructures and psychosocial pathways, such as
family dynamics, peer influence, and school-related distress, that align with
established risk factors for substance use.

*Zhuxuanzi Wang,Mingqiao Mo,Xi Xiao,Chen Liu,Chenrui Ma,Yunbei Zhang,Xiao Wang,Smita Krishnaswamy,Tianyang Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CTR-LoRA是一个基于曲率信任区域的参数高效微调框架，通过秩调度和稳定性感知优化，在保持高效的同时提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PEFT方法虽然通过低秩更新、量化或启发式预算分配提高了效率，但往往将容量分配与训练过程中更新的演化方式解耦，缺乏对训练稳定性和性能的全面考虑。

Method: CTR-LoRA框架结合秩调度和稳定性感知优化，基于轻量级二阶代理的边际效用分配参数，并使用Fisher/Hessian度量信任区域来约束更新。

Result: 在多个开源骨干模型（7B-13B）上的实验表明，CTR-LoRA在分布内和分布外基准测试中均优于强PEFT基线，不仅提高了准确性，还增强了训练稳定性、减少了内存需求并实现了更高的吞吐量。

Conclusion: CTR-LoRA在性能和效率的帕累托前沿上取得了平衡，为更稳健和可部署的PEFT提供了一条原则性路径。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has become the standard approach for
adapting large language models under limited compute and memory budgets.
Although previous methods improve efficiency through low-rank updates,
quantization, or heuristic budget reallocation, they often decouple the
allocation of capacity from the way updates evolve during training. In this
work, we introduce CTR-LoRA, a framework guided by curvature trust region that
integrates rank scheduling with stability-aware optimization. CTR-LoRA
allocates parameters based on marginal utility derived from lightweight
second-order proxies and constrains updates using a Fisher/Hessian-metric trust
region. Experiments on multiple open-source backbones (7B-13B), evaluated on
both in-distribution and out-of-distribution benchmarks, show consistent
improvements over strong PEFT baselines. In addition to increased accuracy,
CTR-LoRA enhances training stability, reduces memory requirements, and achieves
higher throughput, positioning it on the Pareto frontier of performance and
efficiency. These results highlight a principled path toward more robust and
deployable PEFT.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Long Exposure是一个加速LLM参数高效微调的系统，通过解决阴影稀疏性问题，实现了最高2.49倍的端到端微调加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 参数高效微调技术存在效率低下的问题，导致时间投入和运营成本高昂，需要新的加速方法。

Method: 系统包含三个关键组件：阴影稀疏性暴露器（延长感知范围捕获稀疏细节）、序列导向预测器（处理大序列输入和动态参数）、动态感知算子（优化计算模式和内存访问）。

Result: 广泛评估表明，Long Exposure在端到端微调中比现有最优方法快达2.49倍。

Conclusion: Long Exposure为加速LLM的参数高效微调提供了有前景的进展。

Abstract: The adaptation of pre-trained large language models (LLMs) to diverse
downstream tasks via fine-tuning is critical for numerous applications.
However, the inefficiency of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques
presents significant challenges in terms of time investments and operational
costs. In this paper, we first introduce a nuanced form of sparsity, termed
Shadowy Sparsity, which is distinctive in fine-tuning and has not been
adequately addressed for acceleration. Under Shadowy Sparsity, we propose Long
Exposure, an efficient system to accelerate PEFT for LLMs. Long Exposure
comprises three key components: Shadowy-sparsity Exposer employs a prolonged
sensing range to capture more sparsity details under shadowy sparsity;
Sequence-oriented Predictor provides efficient yet accurate predictions to
handle large sequence inputs and constantly-evolving parameters; and
Dynamic-aware Operator facilitates more structured computational patterns and
coalesced memory accesses, addressing dynamic sparse operations. Extensive
evaluations show that Long Exposure outperforms state-of-the-arts with up to a
$2.49\times$ speedup in end-to-end fine-tuning, offering promising advancements
in accelerating PEFT for LLMs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对大型推理模型的死锁攻击方法，通过训练恶意对抗嵌入诱导模型陷入永久推理循环，阻止其输出最终答案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代大型推理模型的链式思维推理机制引入了新的安全漏洞，需要研究如何利用这种迭代思维机制进行攻击。

Method: 使用优化的对抗嵌入鼓励模型在推理步骤后生成过渡性标记，结合后门植入策略通过特定触发标记可靠激活攻击。

Result: 在四个先进LRM和三个数学推理基准测试中实现100%攻击成功率，迫使模型生成达到最大标记限制。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了大型推理模型在推理效率方面的关键安全漏洞，这种攻击具有隐蔽性且能抵抗现有的过度思考缓解策略。

Abstract: Modern large reasoning models (LRMs) exhibit impressive multi-step
problem-solving via chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. However, this iterative
thinking mechanism introduces a new vulnerability surface. We present the
Deadlock Attack, a resource exhaustion method that hijacks an LRM's generative
control flow by training a malicious adversarial embedding to induce perpetual
reasoning loops. Specifically, the optimized embedding encourages transitional
tokens (e.g., "Wait", "But") after reasoning steps, preventing the model from
concluding its answer. A key challenge we identify is the
continuous-to-discrete projection gap: na\"ive projections of adversarial
embeddings to token sequences nullify the attack. To overcome this, we
introduce a backdoor implantation strategy, enabling reliable activation
through specific trigger tokens. Our method achieves a 100% attack success rate
across four advanced LRMs (Phi-RM, Nemotron-Nano, R1-Qwen, R1-Llama) and three
math reasoning benchmarks, forcing models to generate up to their maximum token
limits. The attack is also stealthy (in terms of causing negligible utility
loss on benign user inputs) and remains robust against existing strategies
trying to mitigate the overthinking issue. Our findings expose a critical and
underexplored security vulnerability in LRMs from the perspective of reasoning
(in)efficiency.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Gains方法，用于解决联邦学习中新客户端持续加入时的细粒度知识发现和适应问题，通过模型拆分、贡献驱动聚合和抗遗忘机制实现平衡适应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景中联邦学习面临新客户端不断加入的问题，现有方法在知识发现粒度、源域性能保持和适应效率方面存在不足。

Method: 将模型拆分为编码器和分类器，开发细粒度知识发现和贡献驱动聚合技术，设计抗遗忘机制保护源域性能。

Result: 在三种典型数据偏移场景的多域数据集实验中，Gains在源域和目标域客户端性能上显著优于其他基线方法。

Conclusion: Gains方法有效解决了开放集联邦学习中的知识发现和适应问题，实现了源域和目标域性能的平衡提升。

Abstract: Conventional federated learning (FL) assumes a closed world with a fixed
total number of clients. In contrast, new clients continuously join the FL
process in real-world scenarios, introducing new knowledge. This raises two
critical demands: detecting new knowledge, i.e., knowledge discovery, and
integrating it into the global model, i.e., knowledge adaptation. Existing
research focuses on coarse-grained knowledge discovery, and often sacrifices
source domain performance and adaptation efficiency. To this end, we propose a
fine-grained federated domain adaptation approach in open set (Gains). Gains
splits the model into an encoder and a classifier, empirically revealing
features extracted by the encoder are sensitive to domain shifts while
classifier parameters are sensitive to class increments. Based on this, we
develop fine-grained knowledge discovery and contribution-driven aggregation
techniques to identify and incorporate new knowledge. Additionally, an
anti-forgetting mechanism is designed to preserve source domain performance,
ensuring balanced adaptation. Experimental results on multi-domain datasets
across three typical data-shift scenarios demonstrate that Gains significantly
outperforms other baselines in performance for both source-domain and
target-domain clients. Code is available at:

Motivation: 3D IC热管理面临高功率密度挑战，传统PDE方法速度慢，机器学习方法存在高频信息丢失和高保真数据依赖问题。

Method: 提出SAU-FNO框架，整合自注意力机制捕捉长程依赖，U-Net建模局部高频特征，FNO加速计算，并采用迁移学习优化低保真数据。

Result: SAU-FNO在热预测精度上达到SOTA水平，相比传统FEM方法实现842倍加速。

Conclusion: SAU-FNO是3D IC热仿真的高效工具，显著减少对高保真数据的依赖并加速训练过程。

Abstract: Thermal management in 3D ICs is increasingly challenging due to higher power
densities. Traditional PDE-solving-based methods, while accurate, are too slow
for iterative design. Machine learning approaches like FNO provide faster
alternatives but suffer from high-frequency information loss and high-fidelity
data dependency. We introduce Self-Attention U-Net Fourier Neural Operator
(SAU-FNO), a novel framework combining self-attention and U-Net with FNO to
capture long-range dependencies and model local high-frequency features
effectively. Transfer learning is employed to fine-tune low-fidelity data,
minimizing the need for extensive high-fidelity datasets and speeding up
training. Experiments demonstrate that SAU-FNO achieves state-of-the-art
thermal prediction accuracy and provides an 842x speedup over traditional FEM
methods, making it an efficient tool for advanced 3D IC thermal simulations.

*Paul-Niklas Ken Kandora,Simon Caspar Zeller,Aaron Jeremias Elsing,Elena Kuss,Steffen Rebennack*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LinearizeLLM是一个基于代理的框架，利用大语言模型自动将非线性优化问题转化为线性优化问题，通过专门代理处理不同类型的非线性模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非线性优化问题的线性化通常需要专家手动完成，这个过程既耗时又依赖专业知识，但又是使用线性优化求解器或特殊算法解决问题的必要步骤。

Method: 框架为每种非线性模式分配专门的reformulation代理，这些代理被明确指示为其负责的非线性模式（如绝对值项、决策变量的双线性乘积）推导精确的线性重构，然后协调组装成与原始问题等价的求解器就绪线性模型。

Result: 在基于ComplexOR数据集的20个真实世界非线性优化问题上进行了评估，结果表明专门的LLM代理能够自动化线性化任务。

Conclusion: 专门的LLM代理可以自动化线性化任务，为非线优化的全对话式建模管道开辟了道路。

Abstract: Reformulating nonlinear optimization problems is largely manual and
expertise-intensive, yet it remains essential for solving such problems with
linear optimization solvers or applying special-purpose algorithms. We
introduce \textit{LinearizeLLM}, an agent-based framework that solves this task
by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs). The framework assigns each
nonlinear pattern to a \textit{reformulation agent} that is explicitly
instructed to derive an exact linear reformulation for its nonlinearity
pattern, for instance, absolute-value terms or bilinear products of decision
variables. The agents then coordinate to assemble a solver-ready linear model
equivalent to the original problem. To benchmark the approach, we create a
dataset of 20 real-world nonlinear optimization problems derived from the
established ComplexOR dataset of linear optimization problems. We evaluate our
approach with several LLMs. Our results indicate that specialized LLM agents
can automate linearization tasks, opening a path toward fully conversational
modeling pipelines for nonlinear optimization.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然已知高质量训练数据对机器学习至关重要，但数据的几何结构对模型性能的影响尚未充分探索。作者认为数据表示的丰富性和冗余消除是影响学习结果的关键因素。

Method: 使用持久同调从度量空间中的数据提取拓扑特征，提供了一种超越基于熵的度量来量化多样性的原则性方法。

Result: 研究发现持久同调是分析和增强驱动AI系统的训练数据的强大工具。

Conclusion: 持久同调为理解训练数据的几何结构及其对机器学习性能的影响提供了新的分析框架。

Abstract: High-quality training data is the foundation of machine learning and
artificial intelligence, shaping how models learn and perform. Although much is
known about what types of data are effective for training, the impact of the
data's geometric structure on model performance remains largely underexplored.
We propose that both the richness of representation and the elimination of
redundancy within training data critically influence learning outcomes. To
investigate this, we employ persistent homology to extract topological features
from data within a metric space, thereby offering a principled way to quantify
diversity beyond entropy-based measures. Our findings highlight persistent
homology as a powerful tool for analyzing and enhancing the training data that
drives AI systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型存在产生误导或虚构信息的幻觉问题，而幻觉检测面临标注数据稀缺的挑战。

Method: 使用提示引导的LLM响应作为数据增强，生成真实和幻觉数据；引入对比马氏距离评分来评估稀疏中间嵌入的真实性。

Result: PALE在幻觉检测性能上显著优于竞争基线6.55%。

Conclusion: PALE框架具有强泛化性和实用性，无需额外人工标注，能有效检测LLM幻觉。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have garnered significant interest in AI
community. Despite their impressive generation capabilities, they have been
found to produce misleading or fabricated information, a phenomenon known as
hallucinations. Consequently, hallucination detection has become critical to
ensure the reliability of LLM-generated content. One primary challenge in
hallucination detection is the scarcity of well-labeled datasets containing
both truthful and hallucinated outputs. To address this issue, we introduce
Prompt-guided data Augmented haLlucination dEtection (PALE), a novel framework
that leverages prompt-guided responses from LLMs as data augmentation for
hallucination detection. This strategy can generate both truthful and
hallucinated data under prompt guidance at a relatively low cost. To more
effectively evaluate the truthfulness of the sparse intermediate embeddings
produced by LLMs, we introduce an estimation metric called the Contrastive
Mahalanobis Score (CM Score). This score is based on modeling the distributions
of truthful and hallucinated data in the activation space. CM Score employs a
matrix decomposition approach to more accurately capture the underlying
structure of these distributions. Importantly, our framework does not require
additional human annotations, offering strong generalizability and practicality
for real-world applications. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PALE
achieves superior hallucination detection performance, outperforming the
competitive baseline by a significant margin of 6.55%.

Result: AIDA初始化显著提高了AI天气预报的滚动预测能力和效率，在全局降水预报中展现出应用潜力。

Conclusion: DAWP框架成功实现了在观测空间中的天气预报，为摆脱再分析数据依赖提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Weather prediction is a critical task for human society, where impressive
progress has been made by training artificial intelligence weather prediction
(AIWP) methods with reanalysis data. However, reliance on reanalysis data
limits the AIWPs with shortcomings, including data assimilation biases and
temporal discrepancies. To liberate AIWPs from the reanalysis data, observation
forecasting emerges as a transformative paradigm for weather prediction. One of
the key challenges in observation forecasting is learning spatiotemporal
dynamics across disparate measurement systems with irregular high-resolution
observation data, which constrains the design and prediction of AIWPs. To this
end, we propose our DAWP as an innovative framework to enable AIWPs to operate
in a complete observation space by initialization with an artificial
intelligence data assimilation (AIDA) module. Specifically, our AIDA module
applies a mask multi-modality autoencoder(MMAE)for assimilating irregular
satellite observation tokens encoded by mask ViT-VAEs. For AIWP, we introduce a
spatiotemporal decoupling transformer with cross-regional boundary conditioning
(CBC), learning the dynamics in observation space, to enable sub-image-based
global observation forecasting. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that AIDA
initialization significantly improves the roll out and efficiency of AIWP.
Additionally, we show that DAWP holds promising potential to be applied in
global precipitation forecasting.

Conclusion: Cog-Rethinker通过分层元认知推理有效解决了LLM推理训练中的样本效率问题，为弱LLM的推理能力开发提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Contemporary progress in large language models (LLMs) has revealed notable
inferential capacities via reinforcement learning (RL) employing verifiable
reward, facilitating the development of O1 and R1-like reasoning models.
Directly training from base models with RL is called zero-RL. However, previous
works rely upon activating LLMs' inherent capacities through fixed prompt
templates. This strategy introduces substantial sampling inefficiencies for
weak LLMs, as the majority of problems generate invalid outputs during
accuracy-driven filtration in reasoning tasks, which causes a waste of samples.
To solve this issue, we propose Cog-Rethinker, a novel hierarchical
metacognitive RL framework for LLM reasoning. Our Cog-Rethinker mainly focuses
on the rollout procedure in RL training. After the direct rollout, our
Cog-Rethinker improves sample utilization in a hierarchical metacognitive
two-stage framework. By leveraging human cognition during solving problems,
firstly, it prompts policy to decompose zero-accuracy problems into subproblems
to produce final reasoning results. Secondly, with zero-accuracy problems in
previous rollout stage, it further prompts policy to refine these answers by
referencing previous wrong solutions. Moreover, to enable cold-start of the two
new reasoning patterns and maintain train-test consistency across prompt
templates, our Cog-Rethinker applies supervised fine-tuning on the policy using
correct samples of the two stages with direct rollout template. Experimental
results demonstrate Cog-Rethinker's superior performance on various
mathematical reasoning benchmarks, we also analyzed its improved sample
efficiency that accelerates convergence compared to baseline methods.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归大语言模型计算和内存成本高，知识蒸馏可缓解此问题，但面临容量差距和由高维输出导致的近零概率训练不稳定等根本限制。

Method: 提出α混合辅助分布，引入分布设计变量α实现辅助分布的连续扩展，并基于最优性推广了与辅助分布一起使用的散度族。

Conclusion: AMiD框架通过统一的α混合辅助分布方法，有效解决了LLM知识蒸馏中的关键挑战，为未来研究提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Autoregressive large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable
improvement across many tasks but incur high computational and memory costs.
Knowledge distillation (KD) mitigates this issue by transferring knowledge from
a large teacher to a smaller student through distributional alignment. Previous
studies have proposed various discrepancy metrics, but the capacity gap and
training instability caused by near-zero probabilities, stemming from the
high-dimensional output of LLMs, remain fundamental limitations. To overcome
these challenges, several approaches implicitly or explicitly incorporating
assistant distribution have recently been proposed. However, the past proposals
of assistant distributions have been a fragmented approach without a systematic
investigation of the interpolation path and the divergence. This paper proposes
$\alpha$-mixture assistant distribution, a novel generalized family of
assistant distributions, and $\alpha$-mixture distillation, coined AMiD, a
unified framework for KD using the assistant distribution. The $\alpha$-mixture
assistant distribution provides a continuous extension of the assistant
distribution by introducing a new distribution design variable $\alpha$, which
has been fixed in all previous approaches. Furthermore, AMiD generalizes the
family of divergences used with the assistant distributions based on
optimality, which has also been restricted in previous works. Through extensive
experiments, we demonstrate that AMiD offers superior performance and training
stability by leveraging a broader and theoretically grounded assistant
distribution space.

Abstract: Sepsis is a life-threatening infectious syndrome associated with high
mortality in intensive care units (ICUs). Early and accurate sepsis prediction
(SP) is critical for timely intervention, yet remains challenging due to subtle
early manifestations and rapidly escalating mortality. While AI has improved SP

This paper introduces a Multi-Endogenous-view Representation Enhancement (MERE)
mechanism to construct enriched feature views, coupled with a Cascaded
Dual-convolution Time-series Attention (CDTA) module for multi-scale temporal
representation learning. The proposed MEET-Sepsis framework achieves
competitive prediction accuracy using only 20% of the ICU monitoring time
required by SOTA methods, significantly advancing early SP. Extensive

Abstract: How do latent and inference time computations enable large language models
(LLMs) to solve multi-step reasoning? We introduce a framework for tracing and
steering algorithmic primitives that underlie model reasoning. Our approach
links reasoning traces to internal activation patterns and evaluates
algorithmic primitives by injecting them into residual streams and measuring
their effect on reasoning steps and task performance. We consider four
benchmarks: Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP), 3SAT, AIME, and graph
navigation. We operationalize primitives by clustering neural activations and
labeling their matched reasoning traces. We then apply function vector methods
to derive primitive vectors as reusable compositional building blocks of
reasoning. Primitive vectors can be combined through addition, subtraction, and
scalar operations, revealing a geometric logic in activation space. Cross-task
and cross-model evaluations (Phi-4, Phi-4-Reasoning, Llama-3-8B) show both
shared and task-specific primitives. Notably, comparing Phi-4 with its
reasoning-finetuned variant highlights compositional generalization after
finetuning: Phi-4-Reasoning exhibits more systematic use of verification and
path-generation primitives. Injecting the associated primitive vectors in
Phi-4-Base induces behavioral hallmarks associated with Phi-4-Reasoning.
Together, these findings demonstrate that reasoning in LLMs may be supported by
a compositional geometry of algorithmic primitives, that primitives transfer
cross-task and cross-model, and that reasoning finetuning strengthens
algorithmic generalization across domains.

TL;DR: GRPO算法作为RLVR的核心方法，在提升LLM推理能力时存在不一致性。研究发现GRPO本质上是保守的重新加权方案，受限于基础模型分布，无法发现全新解决方案。OOD改进仅在目标任务与模型预训练偏好一致时出现，而ID任务收益随性能饱和而减少。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO在不同推理领域表现不一致（如数学提升但医学停滞），需要探究GRPO在什么条件下能改善推理并实现分布外泛化。

Method: 从数据分布角度进行理论证明和受控实验，训练从头开始的transformer模型，评估在推理深度、输入长度、token表示和组合性等方面的泛化能力。

Result: GRPO是受基础模型分布约束的保守重新加权方案，无法发现全新解决方案。OOD改进仅当目标任务与模型预训练偏好一致时出现，ID任务收益随性能饱和而减少。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), primarily driven by
the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm, is a leading approach
for enhancing the reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Despite
its wide adoption, GRPO's gains are often inconsistent; for instance, a model
may show significant improvement in one reasoning domain, like mathematics, yet
remain stagnant in another, such as medicine. This inconsistency raises a
critical question: under what conditions does GRPO improve reasoning and
generalize out-of-distribution (OOD)? We investigate this from a data
distribution perspective. We first prove theoretically that GRPO is a
conservative reweighting scheme, bounded by the base model's distribution and
thus unable to discover completely novel solutions. We further validate this in
carefully designed controlled studies by training transformers from scratch,
evaluating generalization across reasoning depth, input length, token
representation, and compositionality. Our results provide a principled
explanation for GRPO's boundaries: OOD improvement emerges only when the target
task aligns with the model's pretrained biases, while gains on in-distribution
(ID) tasks diminish as performance saturates. This reframes GRPO not as a
universal reasoning enhancer but as a tool that sharpens pretraining biases.
Our findings motivate future development of algorithms that can expand a
model's capabilities beyond its pretraining origin.

Motivation: 工业界对定制化和成本效益高的大型语言模型需求增长，现有蒸馏框架需要人工干预且难以满足复杂的用户定义蒸馏要求。

Method: Stratos自动选择Pareto最优服务器，动态匹配师生模型对，并根据任务复杂度调整蒸馏策略以优化云托管。

Conclusion: Stratos展示了在垂直领域LLM部署中的潜力，能够自动化蒸馏过程并满足复杂的用户需求。

Abstract: The growing industrial demand for customized and cost-efficient large
language models (LLMs) is fueled by the rise of vertical, domain-specific tasks
and the need to optimize performance under constraints such as latency and
budget. Knowledge distillation, as an efficient model compression and transfer
technique, offers a feasible solution. However, existing distillation
frameworks often require manual intervention and struggle to meet such complex
user-defined distillation requirements. To bridge this gap, we propose Stratos,
an end-to-end LLM distillation pipeline that automates server and model
selection, knowledge distillation, and deployment in distributed cloud
environments. Given user-defined constraints on model performance and system
budget, Stratos automatically selects Pareto-optimal servers, dynamically
matches teacher-student pairs, and adapts distillation strategies based on task
complexity to optimize cloud hosting. Experiments show that Stratos produces a
student model that achieves four times the accuracy of its GPT-4o teacher
baseline on a rare, domain-specific Mahjong reasoning task with reverse
synthetic data and knowledge injection. Moreover, it achieves reduced latency
and cost without compromising accuracy. These results highlight its promise for
vertical-domain LLM deployment.

TL;DR: 该论文提出使用Kolmogorov-Smirnov检验来监测和量化机器学习系统中的分布偏移问题，并展示了KS距离如何影响AI智能体的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决机器学习系统中训练数据与测试数据分布不一致的问题，这种分布偏移会导致预测误差，在安全关键应用中尤其危险。

Method: 采用Kolmogorov-Smirnov检验来测量分布偏移，使用KS距离来量化分布偏移程度及其对AI智能体性能的影响。

Result: 研究表明，即使KS距离仅为0.02，也会导致强化学习智能体在单个交叉路口的行程时间增加约50%，影响显著。

Conclusion: KS检验和KS距离可作为实时监测AI智能体性能退化的有效统计工具，帮助AI系统更智能地应对分布偏移问题。

Abstract: One of the major problems in Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial
Intelligence (AI) is the fact that the probability distribution of the test
data in the real world could deviate substantially from the probability
distribution of the training data set. When this happens, the predictions of an
ML system or an AI agent could involve large errors which is very troublesome
and undesirable. While this is a well-known hard problem plaguing the AI and ML
systems' accuracy and reliability, in certain applications such errors could be
critical for safety and reliability of AI and ML systems. One approach to deal
with this problem is to monitor and measure the deviation in the probability
distribution of the test data in real time and to compensate for this
deviation. In this paper, we propose and explore the use of Kolmogorov-Smirnov
(KS) Test for measuring the distribution shift and we show how the KS distance
can be used to quantify the distribution shift and its impact on an AI agent's
performance. Our results suggest that KS distance could be used as a valuable
statistical tool for monitoring and measuring the distribution shift. More
specifically, it is shown that even a distance of KS=0.02 could lead to about
50\% increase in the travel time at a single intersection using a Reinforcement
Learning agent which is quite significant. It is hoped that the use of KS Test
and KS distance in AI-based smart transportation could be an important step
forward for gauging the performance degradation of an AI agent in real time and
this, in turn, could help the AI agent to cope with the distribution shift in a
more informed manner.

Result: 在基准PDE问题上的实验验证了方法的有效性，某些实验达到了机器精度。

Conclusion: 多截断自适应策略显著提升了ANaGRAM的性能，谱理论框架为正则化的必要性提供了理论依据，并扩展了与格林函数理论的联系。

Abstract: Recent works have shown that natural gradient methods can significantly
outperform standard optimizers when training physics-informed neural networks

with ANaGRAM, a natural-gradient-inspired approach employing singular value
decomposition with cutoff regularization. Building on this analysis, we propose
a multi-cutoff adaptation strategy that further enhances ANaGRAM's performance.
Experiments on benchmark PDEs validate the effectiveness of our method, which
allows to reach machine precision on some experiments. To provide theoretical
grounding, we develop a framework based on spectral theory that explains the
necessity of regularization and extend previous shown connections with Green's
functions theory.

Motivation: 现有研究主要关注静态影响力测量，忽略了数据价值在优化过程中的动态变化特性，特别是在深度模型中。频繁的影响力估计计算负担重，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 开发层感知在线估计器，仅需损失到输出的梯度，避免参数级和全网络梯度计算，同时保持排序保真度。

Conclusion: 该方法使动态数据筛选在实践中变得高效且可扩展，为数据中心学习提供了实用的动态数据价值评估工具。

Abstract: Data-centric learning emphasizes curating high-quality training samples to
boost performance rather than designing new architectures. A central problem is
to estimate the influence of training sample efficiently. Prior studies largely
focus on static influence measured on a converged model, overlooking how data
valuation dynamically changes during optimization. This omission neglects the
dynamic nature of sample influence during optimization, especially in deep
models. To address the computational burden of frequent influence estimation,
we develop a layer-aware online estimator that requires only loss-to-output
gradients. This design avoids parameter-level and full-network gradients while
preserving ranking fidelity. Extensive experiments across LLM pretraining,
fine-tuning, and image classification show our method improves accuracy with
substantially lower time and memory cost, making dynamic data curation
efficient and scalable in practice.

Result: 在真实世界数据集上的大量实验表明，STAR能够提升现有时间序列基础模型在多元时间序列异常检测中的性能。

Conclusion: STAR通过专门处理状态变量的分类特性和条件作用，有效解决了现有时间序列基础模型在工业场景中的局限性，显著提升了异常检测性能。

Abstract: While Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) have demonstrated remarkable
success in Multivariate Time Series Anomaly Detection (MTSAD), however, in
real-world industrial scenarios, many time series comprise not only numerical
variables such as temperature and flow, but also numerous discrete state
variables that describe the system status, such as valve on/off or day of the
week. Existing TSFMs often overlook the distinct categorical nature of state
variables and their critical role as conditions, typically treating them
uniformly with numerical variables. This inappropriate modeling approach
prevents the model from fully leveraging state information and even leads to a
significant degradation in detection performance after state variables are
integrated. To address this critical limitation, this paper proposes a novel
STate-aware AdapteR (STAR). STAR is a plug-and-play module designed to enhance
the capability of TSFMs in modeling and leveraging state variables during the
fine-tuning stage. Specifically, STAR comprisesthree core components: (1) We
design an Identity-guided State Encoder, whicheffectively captures the complex
categorical semantics of state variables through a learnable State Memory. (2)
We propose a Conditional Bottleneck Adapter, which dynamically generates
low-rank adaptation parameters conditioned on the current state, thereby
flexibly injecting the influence of state variables into the backbone model.
(3) We also introduce a Numeral-State Matching module to more effectively
detect anomalies inherent to the state variables themselves. Extensive
experiments conducted on real-world datasets demonstrate that STAR can improve
the performance of existing TSFMs on MTSAD.

Conclusion: 决策导向框架通过端到端优化传感器布设和预测模型，显著提升了洪水应急响应的决策质量

Abstract: Timely and reliable decision-making is vital for flood emergency response,
yet it remains severely hindered by limited and imprecise situational awareness
due to various budget and data accessibility constraints. Traditional flood
management systems often rely on in-situ sensors to calibrate remote
sensing-based large-scale flood depth forecasting models, and further take
flood depth estimates to optimize flood response decisions. However, these
approaches often take fixed, decision task-agnostic strategies to decide where
to put in-situ sensors (e.g., maximize overall information gain) and train
flood forecasting models (e.g., minimize average forecasting errors), but
overlook that systems with the same sensing gain and average forecasting errors
may lead to distinct decisions. To address this, we introduce a novel
decision-focused framework that strategically selects locations for in-situ
sensor placement and optimize spatio-temporal flood forecasting models to
optimize downstream flood response decision regrets. Our end-to-end pipeline
integrates four components: a contextual scoring network, a differentiable
sensor selection module under hard budget constraints, a spatio-temporal flood
reconstruction and forecasting model, and a differentiable decision layer
tailored to task-specific objectives. Central to our approach is the
incorporation of Implicit Maximum Likelihood Estimation (I-MLE) to enable
gradient-based learning over discrete sensor configurations, and probabilistic
decision heads to enable differentiable approximation to various constrained
disaster response tasks.

Motivation: 研究旨在解决深度强化学习在流体控制中训练耗时的问题，通过知识迁移从低保真环境向高保真环境转移控制策略，提高训练效率。

Method: 采用渐进式神经网络架构，并与传统微调策略进行对比评估，使用Kuramoto-Sivashinsky系统作为基准测试平台。

Result: 微调虽然能加速收敛但对预训练时长敏感且容易发生灾难性遗忘，而渐进式神经网络能稳定保留先前知识并提供持续性能提升，对预训练过拟合具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 渐进式神经网络为稳健、可扩展且计算高效的流体控制提供了有前景的迁移学习框架，特别适用于源环境和目标环境差异较大的情况。

Abstract: This work investigates transfer learning strategies to accelerate deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) for multifidelity control of chaotic fluid flows.
Progressive neural networks (PNNs), a modular architecture designed to preserve
and reuse knowledge across tasks, are employed for the first time in the
context of DRL-based flow control. In addition, a comprehensive benchmarking of
conventional fine-tuning strategies is conducted, evaluating their performance,
convergence behavior, and ability to retain transferred knowledge. The
Kuramoto-Sivashinsky (KS) system is employed as a benchmark to examine how
knowledge encoded in control policies, trained in low-fidelity environments,
can be effectively transferred to high-fidelity settings. Systematic
evaluations show that while fine-tuning can accelerate convergence, it is
highly sensitive to pretraining duration and prone to catastrophic forgetting.
In contrast, PNNs enable stable and efficient transfer by preserving prior
knowledge and providing consistent performance gains, and are notably robust to
overfitting during the pretraining phase. Layer-wise sensitivity analysis
further reveals how PNNs dynamically reuse intermediate representations from
the source policy while progressively adapting deeper layers to the target
task. Moreover, PNNs remain effective even when the source and target
environments differ substantially, such as in cases with mismatched physical
regimes or control objectives, where fine-tuning strategies often result in
suboptimal adaptation or complete failure of knowledge transfer. The results
highlight the potential of novel transfer learning frameworks for robust,
scalable, and computationally efficient flow control that can potentially be
applied to more complex flow configurations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 翼型几何优化需要探索多样化的设计，同时尽可能减少设计变量数量。传统方法存在设计空间维度高、优化效率低的问题。

Method: 从UIUC翼型数据库中选择12个最优基线翼型，通过顺序添加最能增加设计容量的基线，构建设计变形方法。该方法能重构99%的数据库，平均绝对误差低于0.005。

Result: 在多目标气动优化中，AirDbM表现出快速收敛性，获得的帕累托前沿具有更大的超体积，发现了具有增强升阻比的新帕累托最优解。在强化学习中，相比传统参数化方法表现出色。

Conclusion: AirDbM通过系统降低设计空间维度，在翼型优化中实现了高效性能，证明了设计变形方法在机器学习驱动设计中的广泛潜力。

Abstract: Effective airfoil geometry optimization requires exploring a diverse range of
designs using as few design variables as possible. This study introduces
AirDbM, a Design-by-Morphing (DbM) approach specialized for airfoil
optimization that systematically reduces design-space dimensionality. AirDbM
selects an optimal set of 12 baseline airfoils from the UIUC airfoil database,
which contains over 1,600 shapes, by sequentially adding the baseline that most
increases the design capacity. With these baselines, AirDbM reconstructs 99 \%
of the database with a mean absolute error below 0.005, which matches the
performance of a previous DbM approach that used more baselines. In
multi-objective aerodynamic optimization, AirDbM demonstrates rapid convergence
and achieves a Pareto front with a greater hypervolume than that of the
previous larger-baseline study, where new Pareto-optimal solutions are
discovered with enhanced lift-to-drag ratios at moderate stall tolerances.
Furthermore, AirDbM demonstrates outstanding adaptability for reinforcement
learning (RL) agents in generating airfoil geometry when compared to
conventional airfoil parameterization methods, implying the broader potential
of DbM in machine learning-driven design.

Conclusion: 特征驱动强化学习为光伏生产者的主动日内参与提供了实用、数据高效且可操作部署的路径。

Abstract: Photovoltaic (PV) operators face substantial uncertainty in generation and
short-term electricity prices. Continuous intraday markets enable producers to
adjust their positions in real time, potentially improving revenues and
reducing imbalance costs. We propose a feature-driven reinforcement learning
(RL) approach for PV intraday trading that integrates data-driven features into
the state and learns bidding policies in a sequential decision framework. The
problem is cast as a Markov Decision Process with a reward that balances
trading profit and imbalance penalties and is solved with Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO) using a predominantly linear, interpretable policy. Trained
on historical market data and evaluated out-of-sample, the strategy
consistently outperforms benchmark baselines across diverse scenarios.
Extensive validation shows rapid convergence, real-time inference, and
transparent decision rules. Learned weights highlight the central role of
market microstructure and historical features. Taken together, these results
indicate that feature-driven RL offers a practical, data-efficient, and
operationally deployable pathway for active intraday participation by PV
producers.

Conclusion: IB-FT方法能有效克服代码生成中的记忆障碍问题，相比传统微调方法具有更好的泛化性能和稳定性

Abstract: Adapting pretrained large language models (LLMs) to code domains via
supervised fine-tuning (FT) has been commonly used for code generation.
However, we identify a previously underappreciated failure mode, the
memorization barrier, where strong memorization of downstream code data in the
base model could trap optimization and prevent the standard FT from effectively
acquiring new, generalizable code knowledge. To overcome this barrier, we
propose the information bottleneck (IB)-guided fine-tuning, termed IB-FT, which
applies an IB penalty on hidden representations of the code data to compress
spurious, memorized features while preserving task-relevant information.
Extensive experiments on two code benchmarks (OriGen and Evol-CodeAlpaca-V1)
show that IB-FT substantially alleviates the memorization barrier, improves
top-1 performance (Pass@$1$), and yields far more stable gains under the
stricter multi-sample metric Pass@$k^{(m)}$ (a problem counts as solved only if
at least $m$ of $k$ samples pass unit tests) compared with conventional FT.

Conclusion: PolyConFM为聚合物科学提供了通用且强大的工具。

Abstract: Polymers, macromolecules formed from covalently bonded monomers, underpin
countless technologies and are indispensable to modern life. While deep
learning is advancing polymer science, existing methods typically represent the
whole polymer solely through monomer-level descriptors, overlooking the global
structural information inherent in polymer conformations, which ultimately
limits their practical performance. Moreover, this field still lacks a
universal foundation model that can effectively support diverse downstream
tasks, thereby severely constraining progress. To address these challenges, we
introduce PolyConFM, the first polymer foundation model that unifies polymer
modeling and design through conformation-centric generative pretraining.
Recognizing that each polymer conformation can be decomposed into a sequence of
local conformations (i.e., those of its repeating units), we pretrain PolyConFM
under the conditional generation paradigm, reconstructing these local
conformations via masked autoregressive (MAR) modeling and further generating
their orientation transformations to recover the corresponding polymer
conformation. Besides, we construct the first high-quality polymer conformation
dataset via molecular dynamics simulations to mitigate data sparsity, thereby
enabling conformation-centric pretraining. Experiments demonstrate that
PolyConFM consistently outperforms representative task-specific methods on
diverse downstream tasks, equipping polymer science with a universal and
powerful tool.

Conclusion: RoBCtrl是首个将扩散模型应用于模拟演化社交机器人行为的框架，成功展示了对抗攻击对GNN检测器的威胁。

Abstract: Social networks have become a crucial source of real-time information for
individuals. The influence of social bots within these platforms has garnered
considerable attention from researchers, leading to the development of numerous
detection technologies. However, the vulnerability and robustness of these
detection methods is still underexplored. Existing Graph Neural Network
(GNN)-based methods cannot be directly applied due to the issues of limited
control over social agents, the black-box nature of bot detectors, and the
heterogeneity of bots. To address these challenges, this paper proposes the
first adversarial multi-agent Reinforcement learning framework for social Bot
control attacks (RoBCtrl) targeting GNN-based social bot detectors.
Specifically, we use a diffusion model to generate high-fidelity bot accounts
by reconstructing existing account data with minor modifications, thereby
evading detection on social platforms. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first application of diffusion models to mimic the behavior of evolving
social bots effectively. We then employ a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
(MARL) method to simulate bots adversarial behavior. We categorize social
accounts based on their influence and budget. Different agents are then
employed to control bot accounts across various categories, optimizing the
attachment strategy through reinforcement learning. Additionally, a
hierarchical state abstraction based on structural entropy is designed to
accelerate the reinforcement learning. Extensive experiments on social bot
detection datasets demonstrate that our framework can effectively undermine the
performance of GNN-based detectors.

Conclusion: GCQ既为高效序列建模提供计算工具，也为神经系统中网格状代码形成提供理论视角。

Abstract: We propose Grid-like Code Quantization (GCQ), a brain-inspired method for
compressing observation-action sequences into discrete representations using
grid-like patterns in attractor dynamics. Unlike conventional vector
quantization approaches that operate on static inputs, GCQ performs
spatiotemporal compression through an action-conditioned codebook, where
codewords are derived from continuous attractor neural networks and dynamically
selected based on actions. This enables GCQ to jointly compress space and time,
serving as a unified world model. The resulting representation supports
long-horizon prediction, goal-directed planning, and inverse modeling.
Experiments across diverse tasks demonstrate GCQ's effectiveness in compact
encoding and downstream performance. Our work offers both a computational tool
for efficient sequence modeling and a theoretical perspective on the formation
of grid-like codes in neural systems.

*Mengtao Lv,Ruiqi Zhu,Xinyu Wang,Yun Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AMS-Quant是一种创新的浮点量化方法，首次探索非整数位宽量化，通过尾数位共享和自适应搜索技术，将LLM量化为FP-5.33-e2m3和FP4.25-e2m2，实现2.8-3.2倍的推理加速，且精度损失可忽略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型参数规模庞大带来存储和推理效率瓶颈，浮点量化虽能加速推理但传统方法仅探索整数位宽，需要进一步逼近量化最佳点来平衡精度和效率。

Method: 提出两种新技术：1）尾数位共享 - 将k个量化权重分组共享最低有效尾数位；2）自适应搜索 - 采用离线优化策略最小化共享带来的精度损失。同时实现高效的CUDA线性核，将内存节省转化为实际延迟降低。

Result: 在大规模数据集和模型上的实验表明，AMS-Quant可将模型量化为FP-5.33-e2m3和FP4.25-e2m2，相比FP16推理显著加速解码（2.8倍和3.2倍），精度损失可忽略不计。

Conclusion: AMS-Quant通过非整数位宽量化成功逼近量化最佳点，在保持精度的同时显著提升LLM推理效率，为大规模模型部署提供了有效的量化解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
various kinds of tasks, while the billion or even trillion parameters bring
storage and efficiency bottlenecks for inference. Quantization, particularly
floating-point quantization, is known to be capable of speeding up LLM
inference by reducing memory footprint and data movement during the inference
process. For the first time, we advance the floating-point quantization
exploration from integer bitwidths to non-integer bit-widths, namely AMS-Quant,
to further approach the quantization sweet spot. AMS-Quant incorporates two
novel techniques to put it into effect: (1) it proposes Mantissa-bit Sharing,
which groups k quantized weights and lets them share the least significant
mantissa bit, allowing us to further approach the minimum quantization
bit-width without accuracy loss. (2) It introduces Adaptive Searching, which
employs an offline optimization strategy to minimize the accuracy degradation
introduced by sharing. Moreover, AMS-Quant is also prototyped as efficient CUDA
Linear kernels, which translates memory savings into wall-clock latency
reduction by reducing memory access. Extensive experiments on large-scale
datasets and models show that AMS-Quant can quantize the model to FP-5.33-e2m3
and FP4.25-e2m2, and significantly speed up the LLM decoding over FP16
inference (2.8x and 3.2x), with negligible accuracy loss.

Abstract: Autonomous agents capable of operating complex graphical user interfaces
(GUIs) have the potential to transform desktop automation. While recent
advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved UI
understanding, navigating full-window, multi-application desktop environments
remains a major challenge. Data availability is limited by costly manual
annotation, closed-source datasets and surface-level synthetic pipelines. We
introduce GUIrilla, an automated scalable framework that systematically
explores applications via native accessibility APIs to address the critical
data collection challenge in GUI automation. Our framework focuses on macOS -
an ecosystem with limited representation in current UI datasets - though many
of its components are designed for broader cross-platform applicability.
GUIrilla organizes discovered interface elements and crawler actions into
hierarchical GUI graphs and employs specialized interaction handlers to achieve
comprehensive application coverage. Using the application graphs from GUIrilla
crawler, we construct and release GUIrilla-Task, a large-scale dataset of
27,171 functionally grounded tasks across 1,108 macOS applications, each
annotated with full-desktop and window-level screenshots, accessibility
metadata, and semantic action traces. Empirical results show that tuning
LLM-based agents on GUIrilla-Task significantly improves performance on
downstream UI tasks, outperforming synthetic baselines on the ScreenSpot Pro
benchmark while using 97% less data. We also release macapptree, an open-source
library for reproducible collection of structured accessibility metadata, along
with the full GUIrilla-Task dataset, the manually verified GUIrilla-Gold
benchmark, and the framework code to support open research in desktop autonomy.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文探讨了智能交通系统中的交通流量预测技术，重点关注图神经网络在捕捉空间依赖性和时间演化模式方面的应用，并分析了现有方法在处理事件信息时的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着城市化进程加快，交通拥堵问题日益严重，需要可靠且响应迅速的交通预测模型来支持智能交通系统的建设，改善城市资源分配和出行体验。

Method: 主要采用图神经网络（GNNs）作为主流范式，包括STGCN、GraphWaveNet、STWave和D2STGNN等模型，这些方法结合了复杂的图卷积结构和时间建模机制，特别擅长捕捉具有周期性规律的交通模式。

Conclusion: 虽然基于GNN的交通预测方法在捕捉周期性规律方面表现出色，但在处理事件信息方面仍需改进，需要减少对领域专家先验知识的依赖，避免丰富语义细节的丢失。

Abstract: Accurate traffic forecasting is a core technology for building Intelligent
Transportation Systems (ITS), enabling better urban resource allocation and
improved travel experiences. With growing urbanization, traffic congestion has
intensified, highlighting the need for reliable and responsive forecasting
models. In recent years, deep learning, particularly Graph Neural Networks
(GNNs), has emerged as the mainstream paradigm in traffic forecasting. GNNs can
effectively capture complex spatial dependencies in road network topology and
dynamic temporal evolution patterns in traffic flow data. Foundational models
such as STGCN and GraphWaveNet, along with more recent developments including
STWave and D2STGNN, have achieved impressive performance on standard traffic
datasets. These approaches incorporate sophisticated graph convolutional
structures and temporal modeling mechanisms, demonstrating particular
effectiveness in capturing and forecasting traffic patterns characterized by
periodic regularities. To address this challenge, researchers have explored
various ways to incorporate event information. Early attempts primarily relied
on manually engineered event features. For instance, some approaches introduced
manually defined incident effect scores or constructed specific subgraphs for
different event-induced traffic conditions. While these methods somewhat
enhance responsiveness to specific events, their core drawback lies in a heavy
reliance on domain experts' prior knowledge, making generalization to diverse
and complex unknown events difficult, and low-dimensional manual features often
lead to the loss of rich semantic details.

Abstract: The recent development of foundation models for time series data has
generated considerable interest in using such models across a variety of
applications. Although foundation models achieve state-of-the-art predictive
performance, their calibration properties remain relatively underexplored,
despite the fact that calibration can be critical for many practical
applications. In this paper, we investigate the calibration-related properties
of five recent time series foundation models and two competitive baselines. We
perform a series of systematic evaluations assessing model calibration (i.e.,
over- or under-confidence), effects of varying prediction heads, and
calibration under long-term autoregressive forecasting. We find that time
series foundation models are consistently better calibrated than baseline
models and tend not to be either systematically over- or under-confident, in
contrast to the overconfidence often seen in other deep learning models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于变电站级电压估计的分层图神经网络，利用电气拓扑和物理特征，在低观测性条件下保持鲁棒性，在SMART-DS数据集上验证了其优越性能。


<details>

Motivation: 随着分布式能源渗透和配电网电压波动性增加，传统配电网状态估计方法难以应对稀疏测量和大规模网络，需要开发更鲁棒和可扩展的解决方案。

Method: 采用分层图神经网络，结合电气拓扑和物理特征，设计能够应对低观测性条件的电压估计模型。

Conclusion: 图神经网络为配电网提供了可扩展、可复现和数据驱动的电压监测解决方案，具有重要的应用潜力。

Abstract: Accurate voltage estimation in distribution networks is critical for
real-time monitoring and increasing the reliability of the grid. As DER
penetration and distribution level voltage variability increase, robust
distribution system state estimation (DSSE) has become more essential to
maintain safe and efficient operations. Traditional DSSE techniques, however,
struggle with sparse measurements and the scale of modern feeders, limiting
their scalability to large networks. This paper presents a hierarchical graph
neural network for substation-level voltage estimation that exploits both
electrical topology and physical features, while remaining robust to the low
observability levels common to real-world distribution networks. Leveraging the
public SMART-DS datasets, the model is trained and evaluated on thousands of
buses across multiple substations and DER penetration scenarios. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves up to 2 times lower
RMSE than alternative data-driven models, and maintains high accuracy with as
little as 1\% measurement coverage. The results highlight the potential of GNNs
to enable scalable, reproducible, and data-driven voltage monitoring for
distribution systems.

Conclusion: 残差学习是线性近似与AC可行OPF之间的实用可扩展桥梁，支持近实时运行决策。

Abstract: Solving the nonlinear AC optimal power flow (AC OPF) problem remains a major
computational bottleneck for real-time grid operations. In this paper, we
propose a residual learning paradigm that uses fast DC optimal power flow (DC
OPF) solutions as a baseline, and learns only the nonlinear corrections
required to provide the full AC-OPF solution. The method utilizes a
topology-aware Graph Neural Network with local attention and two-level DC
feature integration, trained using a physics-informed loss that enforces AC
power-flow feasibility and operational limits. Evaluations on OPFData for 57-,
118-, and 2000-bus systems show around 25% lower MSE, up to 3X reduction in
feasibility error, and up to 13X runtime speedup compared to conventional AC
OPF solvers. The model maintains accuracy under N-1 contingencies and scales
efficiently to large networks. These results demonstrate that residual learning
is a practical and scalable bridge between linear approximations and
AC-feasible OPF, enabling near real-time operational decision making.

Conclusion: FedPURIN为通信高效的个性化联邦学习建立了新范式，特别适用于处理异构数据源的边缘智能系统

Abstract: Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) has emerged as a critical research
frontier addressing data heterogeneity issue across distributed clients. Novel
model architectures and collaboration mechanisms are engineered to accommodate
statistical disparities while producing client-specific models. Parameter
decoupling represents a promising paradigm for maintaining model performance in
PFL frameworks. However, the communication efficiency of many existing methods
remains suboptimal, sustaining substantial communication burdens that impede
practical deployment. To bridge this gap, we propose Federated Learning with
Programmed Update and Reduced INformation (FedPURIN), a novel framework that
strategically identifies critical parameters for transmission through an
integer programming formulation. This mathematically grounded strategy is
seamlessly integrated into a sparse aggregation scheme, achieving a significant
communication reduction while preserving the efficacy. Comprehensive
evaluations on standard image classification benchmarks under varied non-IID
conditions demonstrate competitive performance relative to state-of-the-art
methods, coupled with quantifiable communication reduction through sparse
aggregation. The framework establishes a new paradigm for
communication-efficient PFL, particularly advantageous for edge intelligence
systems operating with heterogeneous data sources.

Abstract: Neural operators have emerged as a powerful data-driven paradigm for solving
Partial Differential Equations (PDEs), offering orders-of-magnitude
acceleration over traditional solvers. However, existing approaches still
suffer from limited accuracy and scalability, particularly on irregular domains
where fluid flows exhibit rich multiscale structures. In this work, we
introduce the Multiscale Neural Operator (MNO), a new architecture for
Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) on three-dimensional (3D) unstructured point
clouds. MNO explicitly decomposes information across three scales: a global
dimension-shrinkage attention module for long-range dependencies, a local graph
attention module for neighborhood-level interactions, and a micro point-wise
attention module for fine-grained details. This design preserves multiscale
inductive biases while remaining computationally efficient. We evaluate MNO on
four diverse benchmarks, covering both steady-state and unsteady flow scenarios
with up to 300K points. Across all tasks, MNO consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines, reducing prediction errors by 5% to 40% and
demonstrating improved robustness in challenging 3D CFD problems. Our results
highlight the importance of explicit multiscale design for neural operators and
establish MNO as a scalable framework for learning complex fluid dynamics on
irregular domains.

Result: 发现浅层自注意力矩阵谱密度一致演化为重尾分布，训练可分为结构探索、重尾结构稳定和收敛饱和三阶段，提出的早停准则与训练进展高度一致。

Conclusion: 随机矩阵理论为监控和诊断Transformer模型训练进展提供了有效工具，提出的验证无关早停准则具有实用价值。

Abstract: This work introduces a novel theoretical framework grounded in Random Matrix
Theory (RMT) for analyzing Transformer training dynamics. We focus on the
underlying mechanisms that drive performance improvements and derive principled
early-stopping criteria. Empirically, we observe that the spectral density of
the shallow self-attention matrix V consistently evolves into a heavy-tailed
distribution. Utilizing the PL (Power Law) fit to this matrix as a probe, we
demarcate training into three stages: structural exploration, heavy-tailed
structure stabilization, and convergence saturation. This staging provides
guidance for preliminary stopping decisions. Crucially, we propose two
consistent and validation-free criteria: a quantitative metric for heavy-tailed
dynamics and a novel spectral signature indicative of convergence. The strong
alignment between these criteria highlights the utility of RMT for monitoring
and diagnosing the progression of Transformer model training.

Result: 在MNIST、Fashion-MNIST、EMNIST和CIFAR-10数据集上，从int8到int1的整数精度范围内进行评估，相比传统四舍五入量化方法表现更好。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效保持神经网络在低精度量化下的性能，提供了一种高效的后训练量化解决方案。

Abstract: This work introduces a post-training quantization (PTQ) method for dense
neural networks via a novel ADAROUND-based QUBO formulation. Using the
Frobenius distance between the theoretical output and the dequantized output
(before the activation function) as the objective, an explicit QUBO whose
binary variables represent the rounding choice for each weight and bias is
obtained. Additionally, by exploiting the structure of the coefficient QUBO
matrix, the global problem can be exactly decomposed into $n$ independent
subproblems of size $f+1$, which can be efficiently solved using some
heuristics such as simulated annealing. The approach is evaluated on MNIST,
Fashion-MNIST, EMNIST, and CIFAR-10 across integer precisions from int8 to int1
and compared with a round-to-nearest traditional quantization methodology.

Conclusion: BPL框架通过双重蒸馏策略成功解决了推荐系统偏差问题，在两种测试环境中都实现了高性能。

Abstract: Recommender systems suffer from biases that cause the collected feedback to
incompletely reveal user preference. While debiasing learning has been
extensively studied, they mostly focused on the specialized (called
counterfactual) test environment simulated by random exposure of items,
significantly degrading accuracy in the typical (called factual) test
environment based on actual user-item interactions. In fact, each test
environment highlights the benefit of a different aspect: the counterfactual
test emphasizes user satisfaction in the long-terms, while the factual test
focuses on predicting subsequent user behaviors on platforms. Therefore, it is
desirable to have a model that performs well on both tests rather than only
one. In this work, we introduce a new learning framework, called Bias-adaptive
Preference distillation Learning (BPL), to gradually uncover user preferences
with dual distillation strategies. These distillation strategies are designed
to drive high performance in both factual and counterfactual test environments.
Employing a specialized form of teacher-student distillation from a biased
model, BPL retains accurate preference knowledge aligned with the collected
feedback, leading to high performance in the factual test. Furthermore, through
self-distillation with reliability filtering, BPL iteratively refines its
knowledge throughout the training process. This enables the model to produce
more accurate predictions across a broader range of user-item combinations,
thereby improving performance in the counterfactual test. Comprehensive
experiments validate the effectiveness of BPL in both factual and
counterfactual tests. Our implementation is accessible via:

Abstract: Domain Incremental Learning (DIL) is a continual learning sub-branch that
aims to address never-ending arrivals of new domains without catastrophic
forgetting problems. Despite the advent of parameter-efficient fine-tuning
(PEFT) approaches, existing works create task-specific LoRAs overlooking shared
knowledge across tasks. Inaccurate selection of task-specific LORAs during
inference results in significant drops in accuracy, while existing works rely
on linear or prototype-based classifiers, which have suboptimal generalization
powers. Our paper proposes continual knowledge consolidation low rank
adaptation (CONEC-LoRA) addressing the DIL problems. CONEC-LoRA is developed
from consolidations between task-shared LORA to extract common knowledge and
task-specific LORA to embrace domain-specific knowledge. Unlike existing
approaches, CONEC-LoRA integrates the concept of a stochastic classifier whose
parameters are sampled from a distribution, thus enhancing the likelihood of
correct classifications. Last but not least, an auxiliary network is deployed
to optimally predict the task-specific LoRAs for inferences and implements the
concept of a different-depth network structure in which every layer is
connected with a local classifier to take advantage of intermediate
representations. This module integrates the ball-generator loss and
transformation module to address the synthetic sample bias problem. Our
rigorous experiments demonstrate the advantage of CONEC-LoRA over prior arts in
4 popular benchmark problems with over 5% margins.

Conclusion: 该方法能有效预测网站间的密码重用风险，生成可操作的风险评分，同时通过联邦学习保护用户隐私，具有实际部署价值。

Abstract: Credential stuffing attacks have caused significant harm to online users who
frequently reuse passwords across multiple websites. While prior research has
attempted to detect users with reused passwords or identify malicious login
attempts, existing methods often compromise usability by restricting password
creation or website access, and their reliance on complex account-sharing
mechanisms hinders real-world deployment. To address these limitations, we
propose PassREfinder-FL, a novel framework that predicts credential stuffing
risks across websites. We introduce the concept of password reuse relations --
defined as the likelihood of users reusing passwords between websites -- and
represent them as edges in a website graph. Using graph neural networks (GNNs),
we perform a link prediction task to assess credential reuse risk between
sites. Our approach scales to a large number of arbitrary websites by
incorporating public website information and linking newly observed websites as
nodes in the graph. To preserve user privacy, we extend PassREfinder-FL with a
federated learning (FL) approach that eliminates the need to share user
sensitive information across administrators. Evaluation on a real-world dataset
of 360 million breached accounts from 22,378 websites shows that
PassREfinder-FL achieves an F1-score of 0.9153 in the FL setting. We further
validate that our FL-based GNN achieves a 4-11% performance improvement over
other state-of-the-art GNN models through an ablation study. Finally, we
demonstrate that the predicted results can be used to quantify password reuse
likelihood as actionable risk scores.

efficiency and strong potential for in-situ training. We extend EP learning to
both discrete and continuous complex-valued wave systems. In contrast to
previous EP implementations, our scheme is valid in the weakly dissipative
regime, and readily applicable to a wide range of physical settings, even
without well defined nodes, where trainable inter-node connections can be
replaced by trainable local potential. We test the method in driven-dissipative
exciton-polariton condensates governed by generalized Gross-Pitaevskii
dynamics. Numerical studies on standard benchmarks, including a simple logical
task and handwritten-digit recognition, demonstrate stable convergence,
establishing a practical route to in-situ learning in physical systems in which
system control is restricted to local parameters.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MSA研究主要关注完整多模态数据的交互融合，忽略了真实场景中因遮挡、隐私约束和设备故障导致的模态缺失问题，导致泛化性差

Method: 1. 去冗余同质-异质分解模块：将模态分解为模态同质、模态异质和噪声表示；2. 分布对齐自蒸馏模块：利用双向知识转移完全恢复缺失语义

Result: 在两个数据集上的综合实验表明，FSRF在不确定模态缺失情况下相比先前方法具有显著性能优势

Conclusion: FSRF框架有效缓解了MSA任务中的模态缺失问题，提高了模型的泛化能力

Abstract: In recent years, Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA) has become a research
hotspot that aims to utilize multimodal data for human sentiment understanding.
Previous MSA studies have mainly focused on performing interaction and fusion
on complete multimodal data, ignoring the problem of missing modalities in
real-world applications due to occlusion, personal privacy constraints, and
device malfunctions, resulting in low generalizability.
  To this end, we propose a Factorization-guided Semantic Recovery Framework
(FSRF) to mitigate the modality missing problem in the MSA task.
  Specifically, we propose a de-redundant homo-heterogeneous factorization
module that factorizes modality into modality-homogeneous,
modality-heterogeneous, and noisy representations and design elaborate
constraint paradigms for representation learning.
  Furthermore, we design a distribution-aligned self-distillation module that
fully recovers the missing semantics by utilizing bidirectional knowledge
transfer.
  Comprehensive experiments on two datasets indicate that FSRF has a
significant performance advantage over previous methods with uncertain missing
modalities.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: STABLE是一个门控持续自编辑框架，通过LoRA参数高效微调来约束顺序更新中的灾难性遗忘，使用三种指标评估编辑稳定性并选择性接受或缩放更新。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型需要持续适应机制，但顺序更新会导致灾难性遗忘，新编辑会降低先前获得的知识。

Method: 使用LoRA进行参数高效微调，通过三种指标（精确匹配下降、比特增加、KL散度）评估候选编辑的稳定性，超过阈值时通过裁剪程序重新缩放或拒绝LoRA更新。

Result: 在Qwen-2.5-7B模型上的实验表明，门控有效减轻遗忘同时保持适应性，基于精确匹配的门控在短持续学习序列中实现了最高的累积性能。

Conclusion: 不同门控策略可以实现可比较的分布偏移，但产生不同的准确性结果，突显了门控设计在持续适应中的重要性，为持续模型编辑提供了原则性方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly require mechanisms for continual
adaptation without full retraining. However, sequential updates can lead to
catastrophic forgetting, where new edits degrade previously acquired knowledge.
This work presents STABLE, a gated continual self editing framework that
constrains forgetting during sequential updates using parameter efficient fine
tuning via Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA; see arXiv:2106.09685). Each candidate
edit is evaluated against a stability budget using one of three metrics: (i)
Exact Match (EM) drop, capturing factual accuracy loss; (ii) bits increase,
reflecting reduced model confidence; and (iii) KL divergence, quantifying
distributional drift between the base and adapted models. If a threshold is
exceeded, the LoRA update is rescaled through a clipping procedure or rejected.
Experiments on the Qwen-2.5-7B model show that gating effectively mitigates
forgetting while preserving adaptability. EM based gating achieved the highest
cumulative performance in short continual learning sequences. Our results show
that different gating strategies can achieve comparable distribution shift
(measured by KL divergence) while producing different accuracy outcomes,
highlighting the importance of gating design in continual adaptation. This
approach offers a principled method for continual model editing, enabling LLMs
to integrate new knowledge while maintaining reliability. Code:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的提示压缩方法在多示例压缩上效果不佳，而简单减少示例数量作为基线表现意外地强。需要更有效的压缩方法来平衡性能和效率。

Method: 提出MemCom层间压缩方法，使用更强的压缩器模型，在每个transformer层压缩多示例表示，实现更细粒度的压缩。

Result: 在多个分类任务上，MemCom在所有压缩比下都优于强基线。在高压缩比下，基线性能下降20-30%，而MemCom仅下降不到10%。

Conclusion: MemCom通过层间压缩实现了高效的多示例提示压缩，在保持高准确率的同时显著提升了推理效率。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been shown to be able to learn different
tasks without explicit finetuning when given many input-output examples /
demonstrations through In-Context Learning (ICL). Increasing the number of
examples, called ``shots'', improves downstream task performance but incurs
higher memory and computational costs. In this work, we study an approach to
improve the memory and computational efficiency of ICL inference by compressing
the many-shot prompts. Given many shots comprising t tokens, our goal is to
generate a m soft-token summary, where m < t. We first show that existing
prompt compression methods are ineffective for many-shot compression, and
simply using fewer shots as a baseline is surprisingly strong. To achieve
effective compression, we find that: (a) a stronger compressor model with more
trainable parameters is necessary, and (b) compressing many-shot
representations at each transformer layer enables more fine-grained compression
by providing each layer with its own compressed representation. Based on these
insights, we propose MemCom, a layer-wise compression method. We systematically
evaluate various compressor models and training approaches across different
model sizes (2B and 7B), architectures (Gemma and Mistral), many-shot sequence
lengths (3k-6k tokens), and compression ratios (3x to 8x). MemCom outperforms
strong baselines across all compression ratios on multiple classification tasks
with large label sets. Notably, while baseline performance degrades sharply at
higher compression ratios, often by over 20-30%, MemCom maintains high accuracy
with minimal degradation, typically dropping by less than 10%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在安全关键领域，拉格朗日方法常用于约束优化问题，但其效果严重依赖拉格朗日乘子λ的选择。目前缺乏关于自动更新乘子鲁棒性和对性能影响的实证证据。

Method: 通过分析多个任务中拉格朗日乘子的最优性和稳定性，提供λ-剖面来可视化回报与约束成本之间的权衡，并比较自动更新与固定乘子的性能。

Result: 研究发现λ具有高度敏感性，自动乘子更新能够恢复甚至超过最优性能，但训练过程中表现出振荡行为，PID控制更新可缓解但需要仔细调参。

Conclusion: 拉格朗日乘子的选择缺乏通用直觉，自动更新方法存在稳定性问题，需要进一步研究稳定化拉格朗日方法在安全强化学习中的应用。

Abstract: In safety-critical domains such as robotics, navigation and power systems,
constrained optimization problems arise where maximizing performance must be
carefully balanced with associated constraints. Safe reinforcement learning
provides a framework to address these challenges, with Lagrangian methods being
a popular choice. However, the effectiveness of Lagrangian methods crucially
depends on the choice of the Lagrange multiplier $\lambda$, which governs the
trade-off between return and constraint cost. A common approach is to update
the multiplier automatically during training. Although this is standard in
practice, there remains limited empirical evidence on the robustness of an
automated update and its influence on overall performance. Therefore, we
analyze (i) optimality and (ii) stability of Lagrange multipliers in safe
reinforcement learning across a range of tasks. We provide $\lambda$-profiles
that give a complete visualization of the trade-off between return and
constraint cost of the optimization problem. These profiles show the highly
sensitive nature of $\lambda$ and moreover confirm the lack of general
intuition for choosing the optimal value $\lambda^*$. Our findings additionally
show that automated multiplier updates are able to recover and sometimes even
exceed the optimal performance found at $\lambda^*$ due to the vast difference
in their learning trajectories. Furthermore, we show that automated multiplier
updates exhibit oscillatory behavior during training, which can be mitigated
through PID-controlled updates. However, this method requires careful tuning to
achieve consistently better performance across tasks. This highlights the need
for further research on stabilizing Lagrangian methods in safe reinforcement
learning. The code used to reproduce our results can be found at

Conclusion: 通过控制人类代理水平的原则确实可以在顺序决策任务中实现人机互补性，所开发的决策支持系统能显著提升人类决策表现。

Abstract: Recent work has shown that, in classification tasks, it is possible to design
decision support systems that do not require human experts to understand when
to cede agency to a classifier or when to exercise their own agency to achieve
complementarity$\unicode{x2014}$experts using these systems make more accurate
predictions than those made by the experts or the classifier alone. The key
principle underpinning these systems reduces to adaptively controlling the
level of human agency, by design. Can we use the same principle to achieve
complementarity in sequential decision making tasks? In this paper, we answer
this question affirmatively. We develop a decision support system that uses a
pre-trained AI agent to narrow down the set of actions a human can take to a
subset, and then asks the human to take an action from this action set. Along
the way, we also introduce a bandit algorithm that leverages the smoothness
properties of the action sets provided by our system to efficiently optimize
the level of human agency. To evaluate our decision support system, we conduct
a large-scale human subject study ($n = 1{,}600$) where participants play a
wildfire mitigation game. We find that participants who play the game supported
by our system outperform those who play on their own by $\sim$$30$% and the AI
agent used by our system by $>$$2$%, even though the AI agent largely
outperforms participants playing without support. We have made available the
data gathered in our human subject study as well as an open source
implementation of our system at

Abstract: World Models have vastly permeated the field of Reinforcement Learning. Their
ability to model the transition dynamics of an environment have greatly
improved sample efficiency in online RL. Among them, the most notorious example
is Dreamer, a model that learns to act in a diverse set of image-based
environments. In this paper, we leverage similarity search and stochastic
representations to approximate a world model without a training procedure. We
establish a comparison with PlaNet, a well-established world model of the
Dreamer family. We evaluate the models on the quality of latent reconstruction
and on the perceived similarity of the reconstructed image, on both next-step
and long horizon dynamics prediction. The results of our study demonstrate that
a search-based world model is comparable to a training based one in both cases.
Notably, our model show stronger performance in long-horizon prediction with
respect to the baseline on a range of visually different environments.

TL;DR: 首次对时变学习策略下的Q-learning算法进行了有限时间分析，在最小假设下建立了收敛速率和样本复杂度，揭示了on-policy Q-learning相比off-policy版本在探索和利用方面的权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Q-learning分析多基于off-policy设置，而对时变学习策略（on-policy采样）的分析存在挑战，特别是在最小探索假设下。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 采用精化方法，利用泊松方程将马尔可夫噪声分解为鞅差项和残差项，并通过敏感性分析控制时变策略下的残差项。

Result: 建立了Q函数估计的收敛速率，样本复杂度为O(1/ε²)，与off-policy Q-learning相同但在探索参数上依赖更差；同时推导了学习策略收敛到最优策略的速率。

Conclusion: on-policy Q-learning虽然探索能力较弱，但具有利用优势，其策略会收敛到最优策略。所开发的分析工具对分析其他时变策略的强化学习算法具有独立价值。

Abstract: In this work, we present the first finite-time analysis of the Q-learning
algorithm under time-varying learning policies (i.e., on-policy sampling) with
minimal assumptions -- specifically, assuming only the existence of a policy
that induces an irreducible Markov chain over the state space. We establish a
last-iterate convergence rate for $\mathbb{E}[\|Q_k - Q^*\|_\infty^2]$,
implying a sample complexity of order $O(1/\epsilon^2)$ for achieving
$\mathbb{E}[\|Q_k - Q^*\|_\infty] \le \epsilon$, matching that of off-policy
Q-learning but with a worse dependence on exploration-related parameters. We
also derive an explicit rate for $\mathbb{E}[\|Q^{\pi_k} - Q^*\|_\infty^2]$,
where $\pi_k$ is the learning policy at iteration $k$. These results reveal
that on-policy Q-learning exhibits weaker exploration than its off-policy
counterpart but enjoys an exploitation advantage, as its policy converges to an
optimal one rather than remaining fixed. Numerical simulations corroborate our
theory.
  Technically, the combination of time-varying learning policies (which induce
rapidly time-inhomogeneous Markovian noise) and the minimal assumption on
exploration presents significant analytical challenges. To address these
challenges, we employ a refined approach that leverages the Poisson equation to
decompose the Markovian noise corresponding to the lazy transition matrix into
a martingale-difference term and residual terms. To control the residual terms
under time inhomogeneity, we perform a sensitivity analysis of the Poisson
equation solution with respect to both the Q-function estimate and the learning
policy. These tools may further facilitate the analysis of general
reinforcement learning algorithms with rapidly time-varying learning policies
-- such as single-timescale actor--critic methods and learning-in-games
algorithms -- and are of independent interest.

Motivation: 现有的稀疏专家混合模型合并策略缺乏理论依据的加权机制，需要更平衡高效的专家协作方法。

Method: 从博弈论视角重新解释专家合并，引入Nash Bargaining机制和复杂动量来优化专家协作过程。

Result: 在语言建模、文本分类、图像分类和零样本鲁棒性任务中表现优异，成功应用于Qwen1.5-MoE和DeepSeek-MoE等大规模系统。

Conclusion: NAMEx为专家合并提供了理论保证的框架，在多种场景下均优于现有方法，具有良好的可扩展性。

Abstract: Existing expert merging strategies for Sparse Mixture of Experts (SMoE)
typically rely on input-dependent or input-independent averaging of expert
parameters, but often lack a principled weighting mechanism. In this work, we
reinterpret expert merging through the lens of game theory, revealing
cooperative and competitive dynamics among experts. Based on this perspective,
we introduce Nash Merging of Experts (NAMEx), a novel framework that
incorporates Nash Bargaining into the merging process, enabling more balanced
and efficient collaboration among experts. Additionally, we incorporate complex
momentum into NAMEx to accelerate expert propagation with theoretical
guarantees for convergence. Extensive experiments across language modelling,
text classification, image classification, and zero-shot robustness under data
corruption show that NAMEx consistently outperforms competing methods while
integrating seamlessly with popular MoE architectures. Finally, we demonstrate
NAMEx's scalability by applying it to large-scale systems, including
Qwen1.5-MoE (14B) and DeepSeek-MoE (16B), where it proves effective in both
zero-shot and fine-tuning settings.

Motivation: 传统零阶优化方法优化平滑后的目标函数(扰动参数下的期望目标)，而SAM方法关注邻域内的最大损失以获得平坦最小值。本文旨在明确连接这两种方法。

Method: 提出指数倾斜目标作为零阶优化和SAM之间的桥梁，开发新的零阶算法来求解参数化软SAM目标，并精确表征倾斜SAM框架的锐度概念。

Result: 该方法可作为SAM变体的无梯度和内存高效替代方案，在分类、多项选择QA和语言生成等下游任务中比传统零阶基线获得更好的泛化性能。

Conclusion: 通过指数倾斜目标连接零阶优化和SAM方法，提供了一种有效的无梯度优化框架，在多个任务上实现了优越的泛化能力。

Abstract: Classic zeroth-order optimization approaches typically optimize for a
smoothed version of the original function, i.e., the expected objective under
randomly perturbed model parameters. This can be interpreted as encouraging the
loss values in the perturbation set to be small on average. Popular
sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) objectives, however, typically focus on the
largest loss within the neighborhood to arrive at flat minima more effectively.
In this work, we connect zeroth-order optimization (and its corresponding
objectives) with SAM approaches explicitly, through an exponential tilting
objective that provides a smooth transition between the average- and the
max-loss formulations. We explore new zeroth-order algorithms to solve a soft
SAM objective parameterized by a tilting parameter $t$. We provide precise
characterizations of the sharpness notions of the tilted SAM framework.
Practically, our approach can be used as a gradient-free and memory-efficient
alternative to SAM variants, and it achieves better generalization compared to
vanilla zeroth-order baselines on a wide range of downstream tasks, including
classification, multiple choice QA, and language generation.

Conclusion: GRUwE证明了简单高效的RNN架构在处理不规则时间序列时仍具有竞争力，且具有易于实现、超参数调优简单、计算开销低等优势。

Abstract: Modeling irregularly sampled multivariate time series is a persistent
challenge in domains like healthcare and sensor networks. While recent works
have explored a variety of complex learning architectures to solve the
prediction problems for irregularly sampled time series, it remains unclear
what are the true benefits of some of these architectures, and whether clever
modifications of simpler and more efficient RNN-based algorithms are still
competitive, i.e. they are on par with or even superior to these methods. In
this work, we propose and study GRUwE: Gated Recurrent Unit with Exponential
basis functions, that builds upon RNN-based architectures for observations made
at irregular times. GRUwE supports both regression-based and event-based
predictions in continuous time. GRUwE works by maintaining a Markov state
representation of the time series that updates with the arrival of irregular
observations. The Markov state update relies on two reset mechanisms: (i)
observation-triggered reset, and (ii) time-triggered reset of the GRU state
using learnable exponential decays, to support the predictions in continuous
time. Our empirical evaluations across several real-world benchmarks on
next-observation and next-event prediction tasks demonstrate that GRUwE can
indeed achieve competitive to superior performance compared to the recent
state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Thanks to its simplicity, GRUwE offers
compelling advantages: it is easy to implement, requires minimal
hyper-parameter tuning efforts, and significantly reduces the computational
overhead in the online deployment.

Abstract: Generative models have become significant assets in the exploration and
identification of new materials, enabling the rapid proposal of candidate
crystal structures that satisfy target properties. Despite the increasing
adoption of diverse architectures, a rigorous comparative evaluation of their
performance on materials datasets is lacking. In this work, we present a
systematic benchmark of three representative generative models- AtomGPT (a
transformer-based model), Crystal Diffusion Variational Autoencoder (CDVAE),
and FlowMM (a Riemannian flow matching model). These models were trained to
reconstruct crystal structures from subsets of two publicly available
superconductivity datasets- JARVIS Supercon 3D and DS A/B from the Alexandria
database. Performance was assessed using the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence
between predicted and reference distributions of lattice parameters, as well as
the mean absolute error (MAE) of individual lattice constants. For the computed
KLD and MAE scores, CDVAE performs most favorably, followed by AtomGPT, and
then FlowMM. All benchmarking code and model configurations will be made

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管基于人类反馈的强化学习（RLHF）已成为语言模型对齐的流行方法，但其内部工作机制仍不透明，需要系统分析对齐是如何实现的。

Method: 在基础模型与其调优版本之间应用层间因果修补，分析人类偏好对中的激活差异，并使用LASSO回归识别关键层。

Result: 对齐是空间局域化的：中间层激活编码了决定奖励一致行为的独特子空间，而早期和晚期层基本不受影响；只有少数层具有将激活距离与奖励增益联系的非零系数。

Conclusion: 基于人类偏好的语言模型对齐是一个方向性、低秩的过程，而非扩散性和参数化的过程。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning frameworks, particularly those utilizing human
annotations, have become an increasingly popular method for preference
fine-tuning, where the outputs of a language model are tuned to match a certain
set of behavioral policies or guidelines. Reinforcement Learning through Human
Feedback (RLHF) is perhaps the most popular implementation of such a framework,
particularly for aligning LMs toward safety and human intent. However, the
internal workings of how such alignment is achieved remain largely opaque. In
this work, we systematically analyze preference optimization for language model
alignment by applying layer-wide causal patching between a base model and its
tuned counterpart across human preference pairs. We implement our methodology
on \textit{Llama-3.2-1B}, and find that alignment is spatially localized:
mid-layer activations encode a distinct subspace that causally determines
reward-consistent behavior, while early and late layers remain largely
unaffected. Utilizing LASSO regression, we also find that only a small number
of layers possess non-zero coefficients linking activation distances to reward
gains. Overall, we show that, at least for some language models, alignment from
human-based, preferential tuning is a directional, low rank process, rather
than diffuse and parameteric.

Abstract: Adversarial examples reveal critical vulnerabilities in deep neural networks
by exploiting their sensitivity to imperceptible input perturbations. While
adversarial training remains the predominant defense strategy, it often incurs
significant computational cost and may compromise clean-data accuracy. In this
work, we investigate an architectural approach to adversarial robustness by
embedding group-equivariant convolutions-specifically, rotation- and
scale-equivariant layers-into standard convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
These layers encode symmetry priors that align model behavior with structured
transformations in the input space, promoting smoother decision boundaries and
greater resilience to adversarial attacks. We propose and evaluate two
symmetry-aware architectures: a parallel design that processes standard and
equivariant features independently before fusion, and a cascaded design that
applies equivariant operations sequentially. Theoretically, we demonstrate that
such models reduce hypothesis space complexity, regularize gradients, and yield
tighter certified robustness bounds under the CLEVER (Cross Lipschitz Extreme
Value for nEtwork Robustness) framework. Empirically, our models consistently
improve adversarial robustness and generalization across CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,
and CIFAR-10C under both FGSM and PGD attacks, without requiring adversarial
training. These findings underscore the potential of symmetry-enforcing
architectures as efficient and principled alternatives to data
augmentation-based defenses.

Method: 以Arcade Learning Environment为例，论证即使被认为是"饱和"的基准仍可用于发展对强化学习的理解，并促进RL技术在现实问题中的部署。

Result: 提出了强化学习研究应转变方向的观点，强调需要更精确地映射基准与数学形式化之间的关系。

Abstract: The last decade has seen an upswing in interest and adoption of reinforcement
learning (RL) techniques, in large part due to its demonstrated capabilities at
performing certain tasks at "super-human levels". This has incentivized the
community to prioritize research that demonstrates RL agent performance, often
at the expense of research aimed at understanding their learning dynamics.
Performance-focused research runs the risk of overfitting on academic
benchmarks -- thereby rendering them less useful -- which can make it difficult
to transfer proposed techniques to novel problems. Further, it implicitly
diminishes work that does not push the performance-frontier, but aims at
improving our understanding of these techniques. This paper argues two points:
(i) RL research should stop focusing solely on demonstrating agent
capabilities, and focus more on advancing the science and understanding of
reinforcement learning; and (ii) we need to be more precise on how our
benchmarks map to the underlying mathematical formalisms. We use the popular
Arcade Learning Environment (ALE; Bellemare et al., 2013) as an example of a
benchmark that, despite being increasingly considered "saturated", can be
effectively used for developing this understanding, and facilitating the
deployment of RL techniques in impactful real-world problems.

### [297] [Expressive Reward Synthesis with the Runtime Monitoring Language](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16185)
*Daniel Donnelly,Angelo Ferrando,Francesco Belardinelli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于运行时监控语言(RML)的新型语言奖励机，能够表达非正则、非马尔可夫任务的奖励函数，解决了传统奖励机表达能力受限的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习中奖励函数通常被视为黑盒映射，缺乏对奖励原因的解释，这阻碍了学习和可解释性。传统奖励机虽然能表示结构化奖励函数，但其表达能力受限于正则语言，无法捕捉更复杂的行为如计数或参数化条件。

Method: 基于运行时监控语言(RML)构建新型语言奖励机，利用RML的内置内存机制来指定非正则、非马尔可夫任务的奖励函数。

Result: 实验证明了该方法在表达能力上的优势，相比现有基于奖励机的方法，在灵活事件处理和任务规范方面具有额外优势。

Conclusion: 基于RML的语言奖励机扩展了奖励函数的表达能力，能够处理更复杂的非正则、非马尔可夫任务，为强化学习提供了更强大的奖励规范工具。

Abstract: A key challenge in reinforcement learning (RL) is reward (mis)specification,
whereby imprecisely defined reward functions can result in unintended, possibly
harmful, behaviours. Indeed, reward functions in RL are typically treated as
black-box mappings from state-action pairs to scalar values. While effective in
many settings, this approach provides no information about why rewards are
given, which can hinder learning and interpretability. Reward Machines address
this issue by representing reward functions as finite state automata, enabling
the specification of structured, non-Markovian reward functions. However, their
expressivity is typically bounded by regular languages, leaving them unable to
capture more complex behaviours such as counting or parametrised conditions. In
this work, we build on the Runtime Monitoring Language (RML) to develop a novel
class of language-based Reward Machines. By leveraging the built-in memory of
RML, our approach can specify reward functions for non-regular, non-Markovian
tasks. We demonstrate the expressiveness of our approach through experiments,
highlighting additional advantages in flexible event-handling and task
specification over existing Reward Machine-based methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习在图像和视频领域很成功，但忽略了问题的内在结构。关系强化学习虽然能处理结构化问题，但对问题结构有强假设限制。

Method: 结合关系强化学习与物体中心表示，通过显式建模策略不确定性，允许系统主动向人类专家查询指导。

Result: 实证评估证明了所提方法的有效性和效率。

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效处理结构化和非结构化数据，通过主动学习机制提高了学习效果。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has experienced a second wind in the past decade.
While incredibly successful in images and videos, these systems still operate
within the realm of propositional tasks ignoring the inherent structure that
exists in the problem. Consequently, relational extensions (RRL) have been
developed for such structured problems that allow for effective generalization
to arbitrary number of objects. However, they inherently make strong
assumptions about the problem structure. We introduce a novel framework that
combines RRL with object-centric representation to handle both structured and
unstructured data. We enhance learning by allowing the system to actively query
the human expert for guidance by explicitly modeling the uncertainty over the
policy. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness and efficiency
of our proposed approach.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We study a nonstationary bandit problem where rewards depend on both actions
and latent states, the latter governed by unknown linear dynamics. Crucially,
the state dynamics also depend on the actions, resulting in tension between
short-term and long-term rewards. We propose an explore-then-commit algorithm
for a finite horizon $T$. During the exploration phase, random Rademacher
actions enable estimation of the Markov parameters of the linear dynamics,
which characterize the action-reward relationship. In the commit phase, the
algorithm uses the estimated parameters to design an optimized action sequence
for long-term reward. Our proposed algorithm achieves
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{2/3})$ regret. Our analysis handles two key challenges:
learning from temporally correlated rewards, and designing action sequences
with optimal long-term reward. We address the first challenge by providing
near-optimal sample complexity and error bounds for system identification using
bilinear rewards. We address the second challenge by proving an equivalence
with indefinite quadratic optimization over a hypercube, a known NP-hard
problem. We provide a sub-optimality guarantee for this problem, enabling our
regret upper bound. Lastly, we propose a semidefinite relaxation with
Goemans-Williamson rounding as a practical approach.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文对标签噪声检测方法进行了系统性基准测试，通过将方法分解为三个核心组件来比较不同技术，发现在多数场景下使用平均概率聚合和logit边缘作为标签一致性函数的方法效果最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界数据集中的标签噪声会影响模型训练和验证，而现有噪声标签检测方法缺乏明确的共识和系统比较。

Method: 将检测方法分解为标签一致性函数、聚合方法和信息收集方式三个组件，提出统一基准任务和新的评估指标。

Result: 在视觉和表格数据集上的评估表明，使用平均概率聚合和logit边缘作为标签一致性函数的样本内信息收集方法在大多数场景中表现最佳。

Conclusion: 研究结果为设计新的检测方法和为特定应用选择技术提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Label noise is a common problem in real-world datasets, affecting both model
training and validation. Clean data are essential for achieving strong
performance and ensuring reliable evaluation. While various techniques have
been proposed to detect noisy labels, there is no clear consensus on optimal
approaches. We perform a comprehensive benchmark of detection methods by
decomposing them into three fundamental components: label agreement function,
aggregation method, and information gathering approach (in-sample vs
out-of-sample). This decomposition can be applied to many existing detection
methods, and enables systematic comparison across diverse approaches. To fairly
compare methods, we propose a unified benchmark task, detecting a fraction of
training samples equal to the dataset's noise rate. We also introduce a novel
metric: the false negative rate at this fixed operating point. Our evaluation
spans vision and tabular datasets under both synthetic and real-world noise
conditions. We identify that in-sample information gathering using average
probability aggregation combined with the logit margin as the label agreement
function achieves the best results across most scenarios. Our findings provide
practical guidance for designing new detection methods and selecting techniques
for specific applications.

TL;DR: 本研究使用机器学习方法分析欧洲绿色协议中气候政策的进展，比较了不同文本表示方法和元数据特征对政策进展预测的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 气候变化需要有效的立法行动来减轻其影响，本研究旨在探索机器学习如何帮助理解气候政策从宣布到采纳的进展过程。

Method: 收集了165项政策的文本和元数据，使用TF-IDF、BERT和ClimateBERT等文本表示方法，结合元数据特征来预测政策进展状态。

Result: 仅使用文本特征时，ClimateBERT表现最佳（RMSE=0.17，R²=0.29）；结合元数据特征后，BERT表现最优（RMSE=0.16，R²=0.38）。可解释AI方法揭示了政策措辞、政党和国家代表性等因素的影响。

Conclusion: 机器学习工具在支持气候政策分析和决策制定方面具有重要潜力。

Abstract: Climate change demands effective legislative action to mitigate its impacts.
This study explores the application of machine learning (ML) to understand the
progression of climate policy from announcement to adoption, focusing on
policies within the European Green Deal. We present a dataset of 165 policies,
incorporating text and metadata. We aim to predict a policy's progression
status, and compare text representation methods, including TF-IDF, BERT, and
ClimateBERT. Metadata features are included to evaluate the impact on
predictive performance. On text features alone, ClimateBERT outperforms other
approaches (RMSE = 0.17, R^2 = 0.29), while BERT achieves superior performance
with the addition of metadata features (RMSE = 0.16, R^2 = 0.38). Using methods
from explainable AI highlights the influence of factors such as policy wording
and metadata including political party and country representation. These
findings underscore the potential of ML tools in supporting climate policy
analysis and decision-making.

Conclusion: 一比特权重压缩在随机特征模型中具有理论保证和实际效益，为神经网络压缩提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Recent advances in neural networks have led to significant computational and
memory demands, spurring interest in one-bit weight compression to enable
efficient inference on resource-constrained devices. However, the theoretical
underpinnings of such compression remain poorly understood. We address this gap
by analyzing one-bit quantization in the Random Features model, a simplified
framework that corresponds to neural networks with random representations. We
prove that, asymptotically, quantizing weights of all layers except the last
incurs no loss in generalization error, compared to the full precision random
features model. Our findings offer theoretical insights into neural network
compression. We also demonstrate empirically that one-bit quantization leads to
significant inference speed ups for the Random Features models even on a laptop
GPU, confirming the practical benefits of our work. Additionally, we provide an
asymptotically precise characterization of the generalization error for Random
Features with an arbitrary number of layers. To the best of our knowledge, our
analysis yields more general results than all previous works in the related
literature.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的RL Web代理环境存在上下文噪声过多、动作执行不确定、无法有效扩展并行训练等问题，需要开发一个既真实又高效的训练环境。

Method: 提出WEBSERV环境，包含：1）紧凑的站点无关浏览器环境，平衡上下文和动作复杂度；2）通过高效启动和重置Web服务器实现可扩展的RL环境。

Result: 在WebArena的购物CMS和Gitlab任务中达到最先进的单提示成功率，启动延迟降低约5倍，存储需求减少约240倍，内存占用相当，支持单主机200+并发容器。

Conclusion: WEBSERV提供了一个高效、可扩展的RL Web代理训练环境，显著提升了训练效率和性能，解决了现有环境的局限性。

Abstract: Training and evaluation of Reinforcement Learning (RL) web agents have gained
increasing attention, yet a scalable and efficient environment that couples
realistic and robust browser-side interaction with controllable server-side
state at scale is still missing. Existing environments tend to have one or more
of the following issues: they overwhelm policy models with excessive and noisy
context; they perform actions non-deterministically without waiting for the UI
or network to stabilize; or they cannot scale isolated client-server containers
effectively for parallel RL rollouts. We propose WEBSERV, an environment that
includes 1) a compact, site-agnostic browser environment that balances context
and action complexity, and 2) a scalable RL environment via efficient launching
and resetting web-servers to enable scalable RL training and evaluation. We
evaluate WEBSERV on the shopping CMS and Gitlab tasks in WebArena, achieving
state-of-the-art single-prompt success rates while cutting launch latency by
~5x and storage need by ~240x, with a comparable memory footprint, enabling
200+ concurrent containers on a single host.

TL;DR: 提出了基于神经常微分方程的连续深度Evoformer模型，用Neural ODE替代原始48个离散块，实现恒定内存成本和计算效率提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AlphaFold等蛋白质结构预测模型中的Evoformer架构虽然强大，但48层的深度导致高计算成本和刚性分层离散化问题，需要更高效的替代方案。

Method: 将Evoformer的48个离散块替换为Neural ODE参数化，保持核心注意力操作，利用伴随方法实现恒定内存成本，通过自适应ODE求解器平衡运行时间和精度。

Result: 在蛋白质结构预测任务中，该模型能生成结构合理的预测并可靠捕获α-螺旋等二级结构元素，但未完全复现原始架构精度，仅用单GPU训练17.5小时即可达到相近性能。

Conclusion: 连续深度模型为生物分子建模提供了轻量级且可解释的替代方案，为高效自适应蛋白质结构预测框架开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in protein structure prediction, such as AlphaFold, have
demonstrated the power of deep neural architectures like the Evoformer for
capturing complex spatial and evolutionary constraints on protein conformation.
However, the depth of the Evoformer, comprising 48 stacked blocks, introduces
high computational costs and rigid layerwise discretization. Inspired by Neural
Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs), we propose a continuous-depth
formulation of the Evoformer, replacing its 48 discrete blocks with a Neural
ODE parameterization that preserves its core attention-based operations. This
continuous-time Evoformer achieves constant memory cost (in depth) via the
adjoint method, while allowing a principled trade-off between runtime and
accuracy through adaptive ODE solvers. Benchmarking on protein structure
prediction tasks, we find that the Neural ODE-based Evoformer produces
structurally plausible predictions and reliably captures certain secondary
structure elements, such as alpha-helices, though it does not fully replicate
the accuracy of the original architecture. However, our model achieves this
performance using dramatically fewer resources, just 17.5 hours of training on
a single GPU, highlighting the promise of continuous-depth models as a
lightweight and interpretable alternative for biomolecular modeling. This work
opens new directions for efficient and adaptive protein structure prediction
frameworks.

Abstract: Despite the promising results of disentangled representation learning in
discovering latent patterns in graph-structured data, few studies have explored
disentanglement for hypergraph-structured data. Integrating hyperedge
disentanglement into hypergraph neural networks enables models to leverage
hidden hyperedge semantics, such as unannotated relations between nodes, that
are associated with labels. This paper presents an analysis of hyperedge
disentanglement from a category-theoretical perspective and proposes a novel
criterion for disentanglement derived from the naturality condition. Our
proof-of-concept model experimentally showed the potential of the proposed
criterion by successfully capturing functional relations of genes (nodes) in
genetic pathways (hyperedges).

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are integral to tasks such as image captioning
and visual question answering, but their high computational cost, driven by
large memory footprints and processing time, limits their scalability and
real-time applicability. In this work, we propose leveraging Singular-Value
Decomposition (SVD) over the joint query (Q), key (K), and value (V) weight
matrices to reduce KV cache size and computational overhead. We in addition
introduce an efficient rank allocation strategy that dynamically adjusts the
SVD rank based on its impact on VLM accuracy, achieving a significant reduction
in both memory usage and computational cost. Finally, we extend this approach
by applying quantization to both VLM weights and activations, resulting in a
highly efficient VLM. Our method outperforms previous approaches that rely
solely on quantization or SVD by achieving more than $10\%$ accuracy
improvement while consuming less hardware cost, making it better for real-time
deployment on resource-constrained devices. We open source our code at

Abstract: Ligand-based virtual screening (VS) is an essential step in drug discovery
that evaluates large chemical libraries to identify compounds that potentially
bind to a therapeutic target. However, VS faces three major challenges: class
imbalance due to the low active rate, structural imbalance among active
molecules where certain scaffolds dominate, and the need to identify
structurally diverse active compounds for novel drug development. We introduce
ScaffAug, a scaffold-aware VS framework that addresses these challenges through
three modules. The augmentation module first generates synthetic data
conditioned on scaffolds of actual hits using generative AI, specifically a
graph diffusion model. This helps mitigate the class imbalance and furthermore
the structural imbalance, due to our proposed scaffold-aware sampling
algorithm, designed to produce more samples for active molecules with
underrepresented scaffolds. A model-agnostic self-training module is then used
to safely integrate the generated synthetic data from our augmentation module
with the original labeled data. Lastly, we introduce a reranking module that
improves VS by enhancing scaffold diversity in the top recommended set of
molecules, while still maintaining and even enhancing the overall general
performance of identifying novel, active compounds. We conduct comprehensive
computational experiments across five target classes, comparing ScaffAug
against existing baseline methods by reporting the performance of multiple
evaluation metrics and performing ablation studies on ScaffAug. Overall, this
work introduces novel perspectives on effectively enhancing VS by leveraging
generative augmentations, reranking, and general scaffold-awareness.

Motivation: 现有图对比学习方法主要关注无向图，忽略了真实网络（如社交网络和推荐系统）中至关重要的方向性信息，需要专门针对有向图的对比学习框架。

Method: 从复数域视角：在磁拉普拉斯中引入个性化扰动来自适应调节边相位和方向语义；从实数域视角：采用基于路径的子图增强策略捕捉细粒度局部不对称性和拓扑依赖。

Result: 在7个真实世界有向图数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法在节点分类和链接预测任务上分别实现了4.41%和4.34%的性能提升，在监督和无监督设置下均达到SOTA水平。

Conclusion: S2-DiGCL通过复数域和实数域两个互补空间视角，构建了高质量的正负样本，实现了更通用和鲁棒的有向图对比学习。

Abstract: Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) has emerged as a powerful tool for
extracting consistent representations from graphs, independent of labeled
information. However, existing methods predominantly focus on undirected
graphs, disregarding the pivotal directional information that is fundamental
and indispensable in real-world networks (e.g., social networks and
recommendations).In this paper, we introduce S2-DiGCL, a novel framework that
emphasizes spatial insights from complex and real domain perspectives for
directed graph (digraph) contrastive learning. From the complex-domain
perspective, S2-DiGCL introduces personalized perturbations into the magnetic
Laplacian to adaptively modulate edge phases and directional semantics. From
the real-domain perspective, it employs a path-based subgraph augmentation
strategy to capture fine-grained local asymmetries and topological
dependencies. By jointly leveraging these two complementary spatial views,
S2-DiGCL constructs high-quality positive and negative samples, leading to more
general and robust digraph contrastive learning. Extensive experiments on 7
real-world digraph datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach,
achieving SOTA performance with 4.41% improvement in node classification and
4.34% in link prediction under both supervised and unsupervised settings.

Conclusion: 记忆化与组合能力之间存在协同效应，这种效应可以帮助模型泛化到未见过的长尾特征组合，为神经网络架构设计提供了新的视角。

Abstract: Deep learning has led researchers to rethink the relationship between
memorization and generalization. In many settings, memorization does not hurt
generalization due to implicit regularization and may help by memorizing
long-tailed examples. In this paper, we consider the synergy between
memorization and simple composition -- the ability to make correct prediction
on a combination of long-tailed features. Theoretically, we show that for a
linear setting, memorization together with composition can help the model make
correct predictions on rare test examples that require a combination of
long-tailed features, even if such combinations were never observed in the
training data. Experiments on neural network architecture on simple data show
that the theoretical insight extends beyond the linear setting, and we further
observe that the composition capability of the model depends on its
architecture.

Abstract: Recent research in time series forecasting has explored integrating
multimodal features into models to improve accuracy. However, the accuracy of
such methods is constrained by three key challenges: inadequate extraction of
fine-grained temporal patterns, suboptimal integration of multimodal
information, and limited adaptability to dynamic multi-scale features. To
address these problems, we propose MGTS-Net, a Multimodal Graph-enhanced
Network for Time Series forecasting. The model consists of three core
components: (1) a Multimodal Feature Extraction layer (MFE), which optimizes
feature encoders according to the characteristics of temporal, visual, and
textual modalities to extract temporal features of fine-grained patterns; (2) a
Multimodal Feature Fusion layer (MFF), which constructs a heterogeneous graph
to model intra-modal temporal dependencies and cross-modal alignment
relationships and dynamically aggregates multimodal knowledge; (3) a
Multi-Scale Prediction layer (MSP), which adapts to multi-scale features by
dynamically weighting and fusing the outputs of short-term, medium-term, and
long-term predictors. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MGTS-Net exhibits
excellent performance with light weight and high efficiency. Compared with
other state-of-the-art baseline models, our method achieves superior
performance, validating the superiority of the proposed methodology.

Result: 理论分析和数值实验表明，在生成建模和贝叶斯逆问题中，稀疏Transformer比传统神经ODE方法具有更高精度和更快收敛速度。

Conclusion: 稀疏Transformer架构通过融入先验信息有效改善了模型性能，在精度和收敛速度上优于传统方法。

Abstract: In this work, we propose a sparse transformer architecture that incorporates
prior information about the underlying data distribution directly into the
transformer structure of the neural network. The design of the model is
motivated by a special optimal transport problem, namely the regularized
Wasserstein proximal operator, which admits a closed-form solution and turns
out to be a special representation of transformer architectures. Compared with
classical flow-based models, the proposed approach improves the convexity
properties of the optimization problem and promotes sparsity in the generated
samples. Through both theoretical analysis and numerical experiments, including
applications in generative modeling and Bayesian inverse problems, we
demonstrate that the sparse transformer achieves higher accuracy and faster
convergence to the target distribution than classical neural ODE-based methods.

TL;DR: SymphonySMoE是一种新型稀疏专家混合模型，通过引入专家间的社交图来增强令牌路由过程，解决了传统SMoE在数据分布变化下的鲁棒性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统稀疏专家混合模型(SMoE)虽然能解耦模型参数量和计算成本，但在面对数据分布变化时鲁棒性较差，容易受到数据污染的影响。

Method: 提出SymphonySMoE，在SMoE基础上引入专家间的社交图结构来建模专家交互，改进令牌路由过程。该方法轻量级、模块化，可与现有SMoE模型无缝集成。

Conclusion: SymphonySMoE通过图结构增强的专家交互机制，有效提升了SMoE在分布变化下的鲁棒性，同时保持了模型的可扩展性和效率优势。

Abstract: Sparse Mixture of Experts (SMoE) has emerged as a promising solution to
achieving unparalleled scalability in deep learning by decoupling model
parameter count from computational cost. By activating only a small subset of
parameters per sample, SMoE enables significant growth in model capacity while
maintaining efficiency. However, SMoE struggles to adapt to distributional
shifts, leading to reduced robustness under data contamination. In this work,
we introduce SymphonySMoE, a novel family of SMoE that introduces a social
graph to model interactions among experts. This graph-based structure enhances
the token routing process, addressing the robustness challenges that are
inherent in conventional SMoE designs. SymphonySMoE is lightweight, modular,
and integrates seamlessly with existing SMoE-based models such as the XMoE and
the Generalist Language Model. We provide both theoretical analysis and
empirical evidence demonstrating SymphonySMoE's advantages over baseline SMoE.
Extensive experiments on language modeling and visual instruction tuning
validate our method's effectiveness. We further highlight the scalability of
SymphonySMoE to models with 4.2 and 7.4 billion parameters, showcasing its
applicability in fine-tuning tasks for large-scale systems.

Conclusion: 提出的Input Domain Aware MoE框架通过概率路由机制有效解决了稀疏专家混合模型中的路由问题，提升了模型性能和专家利用效率。

Abstract: Sparse Mixture of Experts (sMoE) has become a pivotal approach for scaling
large vision-language models, offering substantial capacity while maintaining
computational efficiency through dynamic, sparse activation of experts.
However, existing routing mechanisms, typically based on similarity scoring,
struggle to effectively capture the underlying input structure. This limitation
leads to a trade-off between expert specialization and balanced computation,
hindering both scalability and performance. We propose Input Domain Aware MoE,
a novel routing framework that leverages a probabilistic mixture model to
better partition the input space. By modeling routing probabilities as a
mixture of distributions, our method enables experts to develop clear
specialization boundaries while achieving balanced utilization. Unlike
conventional approaches, our routing mechanism is trained independently of
task-specific objectives, allowing for stable optimization and decisive expert
assignments. Empirical results on vision-language tasks demonstrate that our
method consistently outperforms existing sMoE approaches, achieving higher task
performance and improved expert utilization balance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模仿学习方法在传粉昆虫行为建模中存在不足：当专家策略随时间变化或偏离最优时，无法准确捕捉快慢学习行为，缺乏可解释性，限制了生物学洞察。

Method: 开发序列强化学习框架，最小化预测损失同时识别与行为数据一致的有效记忆窗口；提供完整可解释性；建立蜜蜂策略搜索与多臂赌博机问题的数学联系；发布包含80只蜜蜂在多种天气条件下追踪数据的新数据集。

Conclusion: 该框架为传粉昆虫认知研究提供了新工具，通过改进昆虫行为模拟支持生态系统管理，揭示了学习策略和记忆交互在传粉昆虫决策中的重要作用。

Abstract: We introduce a sequential reinforcement learning framework for imitation
learning designed to model heterogeneous cognitive strategies in pollinators.
Focusing on honeybees, our approach leverages trajectory similarity to capture
and forecast behavior across individuals that rely on distinct strategies: some
exploiting numerical cues, others drawing on memory, or being influenced by
environmental factors such as weather. Through empirical evaluation, we show
that state-of-the-art imitation learning methods often fail in this setting:
when expert policies shift across memory windows or deviate from optimality,
these models overlook both fast and slow learning behaviors and cannot
faithfully reproduce key decision patterns. Moreover, they offer limited
interpretability, hindering biological insight. Our contribution addresses
these challenges by (i) introducing a model that minimizes predictive loss
while identifying the effective memory horizon most consistent with behavioral
data, and (ii) ensuring full interpretability to enable biologists to analyze
underlying decision-making strategies and finally (iii) providing a
mathematical framework linking bee policy search with bandit formulations under
varying exploration-exploitation dynamics, and releasing a novel dataset of 80
tracked bees observed under diverse weather conditions. This benchmark
facilitates research on pollinator cognition and supports ecological governance
by improving simulations of insect behavior in agroecosystems. Our findings
shed new light on the learning strategies and memory interplay shaping
pollinator decision-making.

Motivation: 高维异构数据中的复杂特征交互和跨尺度依赖关系给传统预测建模带来挑战，特别是PLS方法难以处理非线性关系和样本特定相关性。

Method: 引入自适应核注意力机制，分别处理不同特征组再进行整合，既能捕捉局部模式又能保持全局关系。

Result: 实验结果显示在多个数据集上相比最先进方法有显著性能提升。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法通过新颖的架构创新有效解决了高维异构数据中的复杂交互建模问题。

Abstract: High-dimensional, heterogeneous data with complex feature interactions pose
significant challenges for traditional predictive modeling approaches. While
Projection to Latent Structures (PLS) remains a popular technique, it struggles
to model complex non-linear relationships, especially in multivariate systems
with high-dimensional correlation structures. This challenge is further
compounded by simultaneous interactions across multiple scales, where local
processing fails to capture crossgroup dependencies. Additionally, static
feature weighting limits adaptability to contextual variations, as it ignores
sample-specific relevance. To address these limitations, we propose a novel
method that enhances predictive performance through novel architectural
innovations. Our architecture introduces an adaptive kernel-based attention
mechanism that processes distinct feature groups separately before integration,
enabling capture of local patterns while preserving global relationships.
Experimental results show substantial improvements in performance metrics,
compared to the state-of-the-art methods across diverse datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的多元时间序列异常罕见且通常无标签，现有方法依赖复杂架构，只能检测部分异常片段且性能被高估。

Method: 将每个变量的过去序列编码为因果嵌入来联合预测当前时间点和重建输入窗口，使用自注意力机制将嵌入投影到共享潜在空间，并将投影嵌入对齐到代表正常状态关系的稳定潜在结构。

Result: 在多个真实世界数据集和评估协议上实现了最先进的结果。

Conclusion: OracleAD不仅性能优越，还能通过稳定潜在结构提供可解释性，直接在嵌入层面识别根本原因变量。

Abstract: Real-world multivariate time series anomalies are rare and often unlabeled.
Additionally, prevailing methods rely on increasingly complex architectures
tuned to benchmarks, detecting only fragments of anomalous segments and
overstating performance. In this paper, we introduce OracleAD, a simple and
interpretable unsupervised framework for multivariate time series anomaly
detection. OracleAD encodes each variable's past sequence into a single causal
embedding to jointly predict the present time point and reconstruct the input
window, effectively modeling temporal dynamics. These embeddings then undergo a
self-attention mechanism to project them into a shared latent space and capture
spatial relationships. These relationships are not static, since they are
modeled by a property that emerges from each variable's temporal dynamics. The
projected embeddings are aligned to a Stable Latent Structure (SLS)
representing normal-state relationships. Anomalies are identified using a dual
scoring mechanism based on prediction error and deviation from the SLS,
enabling fine-grained anomaly diagnosis at each time point and across
individual variables. Since any noticeable SLS deviation originates from
embeddings that violate the learned temporal causality of normal data, OracleAD
directly pinpoints the root-cause variables at the embedding level. OracleAD
achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple real-world datasets and
evaluation protocols, while remaining interpretable through SLS.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于连通性因子(CF)的eDCF方法，用于鲁棒地估计高维数据的本征维度，在不同尺度下都能获得稳定估计，并在噪声环境下表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代数据集通常包含具有复杂依赖关系的高维特征，估计本征维度是分析这类数据的关键。但由于尺度依赖性问题，现有方法在精细尺度下会因噪声而高估，在粗尺度下则稳定到较低的尺度不变值。

Method: 提出eDCF方法，基于连通性因子(CF)这一局部连通性度量，具有可扩展性和并行化特性，能够跨不同尺度鲁棒地估计本征维度。

Result: 在合成基准测试中与领先估计器表现相当，平均绝对误差(MAE)可比。在中高噪声水平和大数据集下，本征维度精确匹配率高达25.0%，优于MLE的16.7%和TWO-NN的12.5%。还能准确检测决策边界中的分形几何。

Conclusion: eDCF方法能够有效估计复杂高维数据的本征维度，特别是在噪声环境下表现优异，并证实了其在分析现实结构化数据中的实用性。

Abstract: Modern datasets often contain high-dimensional features exhibiting complex
dependencies. To effectively analyze such data, dimensionality reduction
methods rely on estimating the dataset's intrinsic dimension (id) as a measure
of its underlying complexity. However, estimating id is challenging due to its
dependence on scale: at very fine scales, noise inflates id estimates, while at
coarser scales, estimates stabilize to lower, scale-invariant values. This
paper introduces a novel, scalable, and parallelizable method called eDCF,
which is based on Connectivity Factor (CF), a local connectivity-based metric,
to robustly estimate intrinsic dimension across varying scales. Our method
consistently matches leading estimators, achieving comparable values of mean
absolute error (MAE) on synthetic benchmarks with noisy samples. Moreover, our
approach also attains higher exact intrinsic dimension match rates, reaching up
to 25.0% compared to 16.7% for MLE and 12.5% for TWO-NN, particularly excelling
under medium to high noise levels and large datasets. Further, we showcase our
method's ability to accurately detect fractal geometries in decision
boundaries, confirming its utility for analyzing realistic, structured data.

Motivation: 现有LLM在因果发现中的评估可能受到预训练数据泄露的影响，需要验证LLM是否真正具备因果推理能力，以及如何在没有记忆问题的情况下衡量这种能力。

Method: 开发基于近期科学研究的稳健评估协议防止数据泄露，设计结合LLM知识（作为先验）与数据驱动统计（如PC算法）的混合方法。

Conclusion: 呼吁社区采用基于科学、抗泄露的基准测试，并投资于适合真实世界研究的混合因果发现方法。

Abstract: Recent claims of strong performance by Large Language Models (LLMs) on causal
discovery are undermined by a key flaw: many evaluations rely on benchmarks
likely included in pretraining corpora. Thus, apparent success suggests that
LLM-only methods, which ignore observational data, outperform classical
statistical approaches. We challenge this narrative by asking: Do LLMs truly
reason about causal structure, and how can we measure it without memorization
concerns? Can they be trusted for real-world scientific discovery? We argue
that realizing LLMs' potential for causal analysis requires two shifts: (P.1)
developing robust evaluation protocols based on recent scientific studies to
guard against dataset leakage, and (P.2) designing hybrid methods that combine
LLM-derived knowledge with data-driven statistics. To address P.1, we encourage
evaluating discovery methods on novel, real-world scientific studies. We
outline a practical recipe for extracting causal graphs from recent
publications released after an LLM's training cutoff, ensuring relevance and
preventing memorization while capturing both established and novel relations.
Compared to benchmarks like BNLearn, where LLMs achieve near-perfect accuracy,
they perform far worse on our curated graphs, underscoring the need for
statistical grounding. Supporting P.2, we show that using LLM predictions as
priors for the classical PC algorithm significantly improves accuracy over both
LLM-only and purely statistical methods. We call on the community to adopt
science-grounded, leakage-resistant benchmarks and invest in hybrid causal
discovery methods suited to real-world inquiry.

Conclusion: 机器学习、LLMs和XAI可共同构建对AI研究人类行为的信任和理解，对量化主观幸福感有重要意义。

Abstract: Life satisfaction is a crucial facet of human well-being. Hence, research on
life satisfaction is incumbent for understanding how individuals experience
their lives and influencing interventions targeted at enhancing mental health
and well-being. Life satisfaction has traditionally been measured using analog,
complicated, and frequently error-prone methods. These methods raise questions
concerning validation and propagation. However, this study demonstrates the
potential for machine learning algorithms to predict life satisfaction with a
high accuracy of 93.80% and a 73.00% macro F1-score. The dataset comes from a
government survey of 19000 people aged 16-64 years in Denmark. Using feature
learning techniques, 27 significant questions for assessing contentment were
extracted, making the study highly reproducible, simple, and easily
interpretable. Furthermore, clinical and biomedical large language models
(LLMs) were explored for predicting life satisfaction by converting tabular
data into natural language sentences through mapping and adding meaningful
counterparts, achieving an accuracy of 93.74% and macro F1-score of 73.21%. It
was found that life satisfaction prediction is more closely related to the
biomedical domain than the clinical domain. Ablation studies were also
conducted to understand the impact of data resampling and feature selection
techniques on model performance. Moreover, the correlation between primary
determinants with different age brackets was analyzed, and it was found that
health condition is the most important determinant across all ages. This study
demonstrates how machine learning, large language models and XAI can jointly
contribute to building trust and understanding in using AI to investigate human
behavior, with significant ramifications for academics and professionals
working to quantify and comprehend subjective well-being.

Conclusion: 该工作推动了EEG基础模型的发展，为可扩展和泛化的神经信息处理系统提供了见解。

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) has wide-ranging applications, from clinical
diagnosis to brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). With the increasing volume and
variety of EEG data, there has been growing interest in establishing foundation
models (FMs) to scale up and generalize neural decoding. Despite showing early
potential, applying FMs to EEG remains challenging due to substantial
inter-subject, inter-task, and inter-condition variability, as well as diverse
electrode configurations across recording setups. To tackle these open
challenges, we propose NeurIPT, a foundation model developed for diverse
EEG-based Neural Interfaces with a Pre-trained Transformer by capturing both
homogeneous and heterogeneous spatio-temporal characteristics inherent in EEG
signals. Temporally, we introduce Amplitude-Aware Masked Pretraining (AAMP),
masking based on signal amplitude rather than random intervals, to learn robust
representations across varying signal intensities beyond local interpolation.
Moreover, this temporal representation is enhanced by a Progressive
Mixture-of-Experts (PMoE) architecture, where specialized expert subnetworks
are progressively introduced at deeper layers, adapting effectively to the
diverse temporal characteristics of EEG signals. Spatially, NeurIPT leverages
the 3D physical coordinates of electrodes, enabling effective transfer of
embedding across varying EEG settings, and develops Intra-Inter Lobe Pooling
(IILP) during fine-tuning to efficiently exploit regional brain features.
Empirical evaluations across eight downstream BCI datasets, via fine-tuning,
demonstrated NeurIPT consistently achieved state-of-the-art performance,
highlighting its broad applicability and robust generalization. Our work pushes
forward the state of FMs in EEG and offers insights into scalable and
generalizable neural information processing systems.

TL;DR: LANPO是一个将语言反馈与数值奖励分离的强化学习框架，通过构建动态经验池和两个原则（奖励无关反思和相关抽象）来提升大语言模型在数学推理任务中的样本效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习在大语言模型中仅使用标量奖励，丢弃了rollout中的宝贵文本信息，导致样本效率低下。同时，在线整合语言反馈存在信息泄露和无关上下文导致行为崩溃的矛盾。

Method: 提出LANPO框架：1）构建动态经验池；2）奖励无关反思原则用于样本内自我修正；3）相关抽象原则从样本间经验中提取可泛化教训。语言反馈指导探索，数值奖励驱动优化。

Result: 在数学推理基准测试中，7B和14B模型使用LANPO显著优于使用GRPO的强基线模型，测试准确率大幅提升。

Conclusion: LANPO为将历史经验整合到LLM强化学习循环中提供了稳健方法，创造了更有效和数据高效的学习智能体。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning in large language models (LLMs) often relies on scalar
rewards, a practice that discards valuable textual rationale buried in the
rollouts, forcing the model to explore \textit{de novo} with each attempt and
hindering sample efficiency. While LLMs can uniquely learn from language
feedback provided in-context, naively integrating on-line experiences into RL
training presents a paradox: feedback from the same problem risks information
leakage and memorization, while feedback from different problems often leads to
behavior collapse due to irrelevant context. To resolve this tension, we
propose \textbf{Language-And-Numerical Policy Optimization (LANPO)}, a
framework that cleanly separates the roles of feedback: language guides
exploration, while numerical rewards drive optimization. LANPO builds a dynamic
experience pool from past trials and introduces two principles to ensure
feedback is effective: \emph{Reward-Agnostic Reflection} for safe intra-sample
self-correction and \emph{Relevant Abstraction} to distill generalizable
lessons from inter-sample experiences. Across mathematical reasoning
benchmarks, LANPO enables 7B and 14B models to significantly outperform strong
baselines trained with GRPO in test accuracy. Our work provides a robust method
for integrating historical experiences into the LLM RL loop, creating more
effective and data-efficient learning agents.

Abstract: Retrosynthesis prediction is fundamental to drug discovery and chemical
synthesis, requiring the identification of reactants that can produce a target
molecule. Current template-free methods struggle to capture the structural
invariance inherent in chemical reactions, where substantial molecular
scaffolds remain unchanged, leading to unnecessarily large search spaces and
reduced prediction accuracy. We introduce C-SMILES, a novel molecular
representation that decomposes traditional SMILES into element-token pairs with
five special tokens, effectively minimizing editing distance between reactants
and products. Building upon this representation, we incorporate a
copy-augmented mechanism that dynamically determines whether to generate new
tokens or preserve unchanged molecular fragments from the product. Our approach
integrates SMILES alignment guidance to enhance attention consistency with
ground-truth atom mappings, enabling more chemically coherent predictions.
Comprehensive evaluation on USPTO-50K and large-scale USPTO-FULL datasets
demonstrates significant improvements: 67.2% top-1 accuracy on USPTO-50K and
50.8% on USPTO-FULL, with 99.9% validity in generated molecules. This work
establishes a new paradigm for structure-aware molecular generation with direct
applications in computational drug discovery.

Abstract: Applications of machine learning in chemistry are often limited by the
scarcity and expense of labeled data, restricting traditional supervised
methods. In this work, we introduce a framework for molecular reasoning using
general-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) that operates without requiring
labeled training data. Our method anchors chain-of-thought reasoning to the
molecular structure by using unique atomic identifiers. First, the LLM performs
a one-shot task to identify relevant fragments and their associated chemical
labels or transformation classes. In an optional second step, this
position-aware information is used in a few-shot task with provided class
examples to predict the chemical transformation. We apply our framework to
single-step retrosynthesis, a task where LLMs have previously underperformed.
Across academic benchmarks and expert-validated drug discovery molecules, our
work enables LLMs to achieve high success rates in identifying chemically
plausible reaction sites ($\geq90\%$), named reaction classes ($\geq40\%$), and
final reactants ($\geq74\%$). Beyond solving complex chemical tasks, our work
also provides a method to generate theoretically grounded synthetic datasets by
mapping chemical knowledge onto the molecular structure and thereby addressing
data scarcity.

Abstract: Deep learning models have proven enormously successful at using multiple
layers of representation to learn relevant features of structured data.
Encoding physical symmetries into these models can improve performance on
difficult tasks, and recent work has motivated the principle of parameter
symmetry breaking and restoration as a unifying mechanism underlying their
hierarchical learning dynamics. We evaluate the role of parameter symmetry and
network expressivity in the generalisation behaviour of neural networks when
learning a real-space renormalisation group (RG) transformation, using the
central limit theorem (CLT) as a test case map. We consider simple multilayer
perceptrons (MLPs) and graph neural networks (GNNs), and vary weight symmetries
and activation functions across architectures. Our results reveal a competition
between symmetry constraints and expressivity, with overly complex or
overconstrained models generalising poorly. We analytically demonstrate this
poor generalisation behaviour for certain constrained MLP architectures by
recasting the CLT as a cumulant recursion relation and making use of an
established framework to propagate cumulants through MLPs. We also empirically
validate an extension of this framework from MLPs to GNNs, elucidating the
internal information processing performed by these more complex models. These
findings offer new insight into the learning dynamics of symmetric networks and
their limitations in modelling structured physical transformations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种四元数监督学习Hopfield结构神经网络(QSHNN)，利用四元数在表示旋转和姿态方面的几何优势，通过周期性投影策略保持四元数结构一致性，在机器人控制等应用中表现出高精度和快速收敛。

Abstract: Motivated by the geometric advantages of quaternions in representing
rotations and postures, we propose a quaternion-valued supervised learning
Hopfield-structured neural network (QSHNN) with a fully connected structure
inspired by the classic Hopfield neural network (HNN). Starting from a
continuous-time dynamical model of HNNs, we extend the formulation to the
quaternionic domain and establish the existence and uniqueness of fixed points
with asymptotic stability. For the learning rules, we introduce a periodic
projection strategy that modifies standard gradient descent by periodically
projecting each 4*4 block of the weight matrix onto the closest quaternionic
structure in the least-squares sense. This approach preserves both convergence
and quaternionic consistency throughout training. Benefiting from this rigorous
mathematical foundation, the experimental model implementation achieves high
accuracy, fast convergence, and strong reliability across randomly generated
target sets. Moreover, the evolution trajectories of the QSHNN exhibit
well-bounded curvature, i.e., sufficient smoothness, which is crucial for
applications such as control systems or path planning modules in robotic arms,
where joint postures are parameterized by quaternion neurons. Beyond these
application scenarios, the proposed model offers a practical implementation
framework and a general mathematical methodology for designing neural networks
under hypercomplex or non-commutative algebraic structures.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文研究了测试时增强（如RAG）中模型参数知识与外部检索信息的关系，将多步推理建模为知识图上的连通性问题，揭示了知识密度与增强效率之间的相变现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解测试时增强中模型参数知识与外部检索信息之间的理论关系，特别是确定在少量增强步骤下准确回答问题所需的最小预训练知识量。

Method: 将多步推理建模为知识图上的s-t连通性问题，将预训练知识表示为部分且可能有噪声的子图，将增强视为查询真实边来扩展模型知识。

Result: 发现了相变现象：当知识图断开为小分量时，通过增强寻找路径效率低下，需要Ω(√n)次查询；一旦正确知识密度超过阈值形成巨分量，就能以期望常数次查询找到路径。

Conclusion: 模型预训练知识的连通性对测试时增强效率至关重要，知识密度存在临界阈值，超过该阈值后增强效率显著提升。

Abstract: Test-time augmentation, such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) or tool
use, critically depends on an interplay between a model's parametric knowledge
and externally retrieved information. However, the theoretical underpinnings of
this relationship remain poorly understood. Specifically, it is not clear how
much pre-training knowledge is required to answer queries with a small number
of augmentation steps, which is a desirable property in practice. To address
this question, we formulate multi-step reasoning as an $s$-$t$ connectivity
problem on a knowledge graph. We represent a model's pre-training parametric
knowledge as a partial, potentially noisy subgraph. We view augmentation as
querying an oracle for true edges that augment the model's knowledge. Then, we
characterize the necessary and sufficient number of augmentation steps for the
model to generate an accurate answer given partial prior knowledge. One key
result shows a phase transition: if the prior knowledge graph over $n$ vertices
is disconnected into small components, then finding a path via augmentation is
inefficient and requires $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$ queries. On the other hand, once
the density of correct knowledge surpasses a threshold, forming a giant
component, we can find paths with an expected constant number of queries.

### [329] [On the Impossibility of Retrain Equivalence in Machine Unlearning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16629)
*Jiatong Yu,Yinghui He,Anirudh Goyal,Sanjeev Arora*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 多阶段训练中的机器遗忘面临根本性障碍，局部遗忘方法无法普遍实现重训练等价性，因为遗忘结果受训练阶段顺序影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代训练流程常涉及多阶段训练，每个阶段有不同的数据分布和目标。研究旨在探索这种转变对机器遗忘的影响，特别是局部遗忘方法在多阶段训练中的局限性。

Method: 通过理论和实验分析多阶段训练对机器遗忘的影响，使用梯度上升、NPO和SimNPO等局部遗忘算法在Llama和Qwen模型上进行实证研究。

Result: 实验表明，不同训练阶段顺序的模型在遗忘过程中行为出现分歧，GSM8K准确率下降差异超过20%。某些学习路径产生的模型遗忘速度较慢，概率质量分配也呈现路径依赖性。

Conclusion: 重训练等价性对于局部遗忘算法来说是一个不适定的目标，特别是在分阶段训练的场景下。需要重新思考机器遗忘的定义和期望目标。

Abstract: Machine unlearning seeks to selectively remove the "influence" of specific
training data on a model's outputs. The ideal goal is Retrain
Equivalence--behavior identical to a model trained from scratch on only the
retained data. This goal was formulated for models trained on i.i.d. data
batches, but modern pipelines often involve multi-stage training, with each
stage having a distinct data distribution and objective. Examples include LLM
fine-tuning for alignment, reasoning ability, etc. Our study shows via theory
and experiments that this shift to multi-stage training introduces a
fundamental barrier for machine unlearning. The theory indicates that the
outcome of local unlearning--methods that only use gradients computed on the
forget set--is path-dependent. That is, a model's behavior during unlearning is
influenced by the order of its training stages during learning, making it
impossible for path-oblivious algorithms to universally achieve Retrain
Equivalence. We empirically demonstrate the same phenomenon in LLM
post-training across Llama and Qwen models (1B to 14B) with gradient ascent,
NPO, and SimNPO local unlearning algorithms. Models fine-tuned via different
orderings of identical training stages diverge in behavior during unlearning,
with the degradation in GSM8K accuracy after unlearning varying by over 20%
across paths. We also observe that some learning paths consistently produce
models that unlearn slowly. During unlearning, whether the probability mass
gets squeezed into paraphrasing or alternative concepts is also path-dependent.
These results consistently show that Retrain Equivalence is an ill-posed target
for local unlearning algorithms, so long as the target models are trained in
stages. In situations where access to models' training histories is hard, the
current work calls for rethinking the definition and desiderata of machine
unlearning.

TL;DR: StructureFlow是一个新颖的仿真自由方法，能够同时学习物理系统的结构和随机群体动力学，解决了现有方法无法同时处理结构学习和动力学建模的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多自然系统中的物理系统（如细胞生物学）具有高维、随机特性，且只能获得部分噪声状态测量，这给建模底层动力学和推断网络结构带来了重大挑战。现有方法通常只能单独处理结构学习或群体层面的动力学建模。

Conclusion: StructureFlow能够同时学习系统结构和条件群体动力学，这是理解系统行为机制的关键步骤。

Abstract: Modeling dynamical systems and unraveling their underlying causal
relationships is central to many domains in the natural sciences. Various
physical systems, such as those arising in cell biology, are inherently
high-dimensional and stochastic in nature, and admit only partial, noisy state
measurements. This poses a significant challenge for addressing the problems of
modeling the underlying dynamics and inferring the network structure of these
systems. Existing methods are typically tailored either for structure learning
or modeling dynamics at the population level, but are limited in their ability
to address both problems together. In this work, we address both problems
simultaneously: we present StructureFlow, a novel and principled
simulation-free approach for jointly learning the structure and stochastic
population dynamics of physical systems. We showcase the utility of
StructureFlow for the tasks of structure learning from interventions and
dynamical (trajectory) inference of conditional population dynamics. We
empirically evaluate our approach on high-dimensional synthetic systems, a set
of biologically plausible simulated systems, and an experimental single-cell
dataset. We show that StructureFlow can learn the structure of underlying
systems while simultaneously modeling their conditional population dynamics --
a key step toward the mechanistic understanding of systems behavior.

TL;DR: PUMBA是一个基于Vision Mamba架构的蛋白质-蛋白质对接评分函数，通过替换PIsToN中的Vision Transformer，在多个数据集上表现优于原模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的蛋白质-蛋白质对接工具依赖准确的评分函数来区分天然和非天然复合物。虽然PIsToN使用Vision Transformers取得了不错效果，但新兴的Mamba架构在自然语言处理和计算机视觉领域表现优于Transformer，因此研究者希望将其应用于蛋白质对接评分。

Method: 开发PUMBA模型，将PIsToN中的Vision Transformer主干替换为Vision Mamba架构，利用Mamba在长序列建模上的高效性来处理图像块序列，从而更好地捕捉蛋白质-蛋白质界面特征的全局和局部模式。

Result: 在多个广泛使用的大规模公共数据集上的评估表明，PUMBA持续优于其基于Transformer的前身PIsToN。

Conclusion: 将Vision Mamba架构应用于蛋白质-蛋白质对接评分函数是有效的改进策略，能够显著提升模型性能。

Abstract: Protein-protein docking tools help in studying interactions between proteins,
and are essential for drug, vaccine, and therapeutic development. However, the
accuracy of a docking tool depends on a robust scoring function that can
reliably differentiate between native and non-native complexes. PIsToN is a
state-of-the-art deep learning-based scoring function that uses Vision
Transformers in its architecture. Recently, the Mamba architecture has
demonstrated exceptional performance in both natural language processing and
computer vision, often outperforming Transformer-based models in their domains.
In this study, we introduce PUMBA (Protein-protein interface evaluation with
Vision Mamba), which improves PIsToN by replacing its Vision Transformer
backbone with Vision Mamba. This change allows us to leverage Mamba's efficient
long-range sequence modeling for sequences of image patches. As a result, the
model's ability to capture both global and local patterns in protein-protein
interface features is significantly improved. Evaluation on several
widely-used, large-scale public datasets demonstrates that PUMBA consistently
outperforms its original Transformer-based predecessor, PIsToN.

Motivation: 在数据获取成本高昂的领域（如医学成像、环境监测），传统基于强先验的生成模型在数据极度有限时难以泛化，需要解决无信息先验下的主动探索问题。

Result: 在物种分布建模和遥感等多个领域的综合实验表明，该方法显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法能够在复杂现实场景中实现无信息先验下的有效主动目标发现，具有可靠性、适应性和可解释性。

Abstract: In many scientific and engineering fields, where acquiring high-quality data
is expensive--such as medical imaging, environmental monitoring, and remote
sensing--strategic sampling of unobserved regions based on prior observations
is crucial for maximizing discovery rates within a constrained budget. The rise
of powerful generative models, such as diffusion models, has enabled active
target discovery in partially observable environments by leveraging learned
priors--probabilistic representations that capture underlying structure from
data. With guidance from sequentially gathered task-specific observations,
these models can progressively refine exploration and efficiently direct
queries toward promising regions. However, in domains where learning a strong
prior is infeasible due to extremely limited data or high sampling cost (such
as rare species discovery, diagnostics for emerging diseases, etc.), these
methods struggle to generalize. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel
approach that enables effective active target discovery even in settings with
uninformative priors, ensuring robust exploration and adaptability in complex
real-world scenarios. Our framework is theoretically principled and draws
inspiration from neuroscience to guide its design. Unlike black-box policies,
our approach is inherently interpretable, providing clear insights into
decision-making. Furthermore, it guarantees a strong, monotonic improvement in
prior estimates with each new observation, leading to increasingly accurate
sampling and reinforcing both reliability and adaptability in dynamic settings.
Through comprehensive experiments and ablation studies across various domains,
including species distribution modeling and remote sensing, we demonstrate that
our method substantially outperforms baseline approaches.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个紧凑的严格因果基准，用于在MIT-BIH心律失常数据库上使用每秒心率进行流式临床时间序列分析。研究了心动过速风险预测和心率预测两个任务，比较了GRU-D和Transformer模型的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在纵向监测中，需要了解不同模型在不同任务上的表现差异，为临床时间序列分析提供模型选择指导。

Method: 使用MIT-BIH心律失常数据库的每秒心率数据，在记录级非重叠分割下研究两个任务：近端心动过速风险预测（未来10秒）和一步心率预测。比较了GRU-D（RNN）和Transformer模型，并与强非学习基线进行对比。

Result: 在MIT-BIH数据集上，GRU-D在心动过速风险预测上略优于Transformer，而Transformer在心率预测误差上明显低于GRU-D和持续性模型。

Conclusion: 在纵向监测中，模型选择是任务依赖的：紧凑RNN在短时域风险评分中仍具竞争力，而紧凑Transformer在点预测方面提供更清晰的增益。

Abstract: We present a compact, strictly causal benchmark for streaming clinical time
series on the MIT--BIH Arrhythmia Database using per-second heart rate. Two
tasks are studied under record-level, non-overlapping splits: near-term
tachycardia risk (next ten seconds) and one-step heart rate forecasting. We
compare a GRU-D (RNN) and a Transformer under matched training budgets against
strong non-learned baselines. Evaluation is calibration-aware for
classification and proper for forecasting, with temperature scaling and grouped
bootstrap confidence intervals. On MIT-BIH, GRU-D slightly surpasses the
Transformer for tachycardia risk, while the Transformer clearly lowers
forecasting error relative to GRU-D and persistence. Our results show that, in
longitudinal monitoring, model choice is task-dependent: compact RNNs remain
competitive for short-horizon risk scoring, whereas compact Transformers
deliver clearer gains for point forecasting.

Conclusion: 扩散方法为分析噪声SGD提供了有效的连续时间框架，能够精确描述高维设置中的统计风险和隐私损失动态，且提出的变体算法无需梯度敏感性显式知识。

Abstract: The interplay between optimization and privacy has become a central theme in
privacy-preserving machine learning. Noisy stochastic gradient descent (SGD)
has emerged as a cornerstone algorithm, particularly in large-scale settings.
These variants of gradient methods inject carefully calibrated noise into each
update to achieve differential privacy, the gold standard notion of rigorous
privacy guarantees. Prior work primarily provides various bounds on statistical
risk and privacy loss for noisy SGD, yet the \textit{exact} behavior of the
process remains unclear, particularly in high-dimensional settings. This work
leverages a diffusion approach to analyze noisy SGD precisely, providing a
continuous-time perspective that captures both statistical risk evolution and
privacy loss dynamics in high dimensions. Moreover, we study a variant of noisy
SGD that does not require explicit knowledge of gradient sensitivity, unlike
existing work that assumes or enforces sensitivity through gradient clipping.
Specifically, we focus on the least squares problem with $\ell_2$
regularization.

Abstract: Secure federated learning (FL) preserves data privacy during distributed

results in performance bottlenecks, due to straggler clients with limited
computational or network capabilities, slowing training for all participating

addresses compute and network bottlenecks due to stragglers during training
with minimal accuracy loss. Our technique accelerates secure FL training by 13%
to 34% across multiple datasets (CIFAR10, Shakespeare, FEMNIST) with an
accuracy impact of between 1.3% improvement to 2.6% reduction.

Abstract: Zero-shot forecasting aims to predict outcomes for previously unseen
conditions without direct historical data, posing a significant challenge for
traditional forecasting methods. We introduce a Resolution-Aware
Retrieval-Augmented Forecasting model that enhances predictive accuracy by
leveraging spatial correlations and temporal frequency characteristics. By
decomposing signals into different frequency components, our model employs
resolution-aware retrieval, where lower-frequency components rely on broader
spatial context, while higher-frequency components focus on local influences.
This allows the model to dynamically retrieve relevant data and adapt to new
locations with minimal historical context.
  Applied to microclimate forecasting, our model significantly outperforms
traditional forecasting methods, numerical weather prediction models, and
modern foundation time series models, achieving 71% lower MSE than HRRR and 34%
lower MSE than Chronos on the ERA5 dataset.
  Our results highlight the effectiveness of retrieval-augmented and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统因果效应可识别性基于变量层面定义，但实际应用中往往关注特定状态间的因果效应。现有变量级框架可能错过这种更细粒度的可识别性机会。

Method: 通过理论分析，研究状态级因果效应可识别性，考察上下文特定独立性、条件函数依赖和变量状态约束等知识对可识别性的影响。

Result: 发现状态级因果效应可识别性可能优于变量级，但需要额外知识支持；变量状态约束知识单独不能改善可识别性，但与其他知识结合时可同时改善变量级和状态级可识别性。

Conclusion: 状态级因果效应可识别性为从观测数据估计因果效应提供了新机会，现有变量级框架可能低估了实际可识别性，强调了细粒度分析的重要性。

Abstract: The classical notion of causal effect identifiability is defined in terms of
treatment and outcome variables. In this note, we consider the identifiability
of state-based causal effects: how an intervention on a particular state of
treatment variables affects a particular state of outcome variables. We
demonstrate that state-based causal effects may be identifiable even when
variable-based causal effects may not. Moreover, we show that this separation
occurs only when additional knowledge -- such as context-specific
independencies and conditional functional dependencies -- is available. We
further examine knowledge that constrains the states of variables, and show
that such knowledge does not improve identifiability on its own but can improve
both variable-based and state-based identifiability when combined with other
knowledge such as context-specific independencies. Our findings highlight
situations where causal effects of interest may be estimable from observational
data and this identifiability may be missed by existing variable-based
frameworks.

Abstract: This paper presents a framework for processing EV charging load data in order
to forecast future load predictions using a Recurrent Neural Network,
specifically an LSTM. The framework processes a large set of raw data from
multiple locations and transforms it with normalization and feature extraction
to train the LSTM. The pre-processing stage corrects for missing or incomplete
values by interpolating and normalizing the measurements. This information is
then fed into a Long Short-Term Memory Model designed to capture the short-term
fluctuations while also interpreting the long-term trends in the charging data.
Experimental results demonstrate the model's ability to accurately predict
charging demand across multiple time scales (daily, weekly, and monthly),
providing valuable insights for infrastructure planning, energy management, and
grid integration of EV charging facilities. The system's modular design allows
for adaptation to different charging locations with varying usage patterns,

Abstract: The prediction of learning curves for Natural Language Processing (NLP)
models enables informed decision-making to meet specific performance
objectives, while reducing computational overhead and lowering the costs
associated with dataset acquisition and curation. In this work, we formulate
the prediction task as a multitask learning problem, where each task's data is
modelled as being organized within a two-layer hierarchy. To model the shared
information and dependencies across tasks and hierarchical levels, we employ
latent variable multi-output Gaussian Processes, enabling to account for task
correlations and supporting zero-shot prediction of learning curves (LCs). We
demonstrate that this approach facilitates the development of probabilistic
scaling laws at lower costs. Applying an active learning strategy, LCs can be
queried to reduce predictive uncertainty and provide predictions close to
ground truth scaling laws. We validate our framework on three small-scale NLP
datasets with up to $30$ LCs. These are obtained from nanoGPT models, from
bilingual translation using mBART and Transformer models, and from multilingual
translation using M2M100 models of varying sizes.

*Danish Nazir,Gowtham Sai Inti,Timo Bartels,Jan Piewek,Thorsten Bagdonat,Tim Fingscheidt*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于SegDeformer的联合特征和任务解码方法，在车载和分布式应用中降低计算复杂度，同时保持语义分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代汽车系统使用DNN进行语义分割，传统方法使用卷积神经网络进行联合源和任务解码，但未研究基于transformer的替代方案如SegDeformer，后者性能更优但计算复杂度更高。

Method: 为SegDeformer提出联合特征和任务解码方法，在车载和分布式应用中降低计算复杂度。

Result: 在车载应用中，Cityscapes数据集fps提升11.7倍(1.4到16.5)，ADE20K数据集提升3.5倍(43.3到154.3)，mIoU与未压缩的transformer基线相当。在分布式应用中，在广泛比特率范围内实现SOTA mIoU，仅使用之前SOTA 0.14%(ADE20K)和0.04%(Cityscapes)的云DNN参数。

Conclusion: 提出的方法显著降低了计算复杂度，提高了云可扩展性，同时保持了语义分割性能，在车载和分布式应用中均表现出色。

Abstract: Modern automotive systems leverage deep neural networks (DNNs) for semantic
segmentation and operate in two key application areas: (1) In-car, where the
DNN solely operates in the vehicle without strict constraints on the data rate.
(2) Distributed, where one DNN part operates in the vehicle and the other part
typically on a large-scale cloud platform with a particular constraint on
transmission bitrate efficiency. Typically, both applications share an image
and source encoder, while each uses distinct (joint) source and task decoders.
Prior work utilized convolutional neural networks for joint source and task
decoding but did not investigate transformer-based alternatives such as
SegDeformer, which offer superior performance at the cost of higher
computational complexity. In this work, we propose joint feature and task
decoding for SegDeformer, thereby enabling lower computational complexity in
both in-car and distributed applications, despite SegDeformer's computational
demands. This improves scalability in the cloud while reducing in-car
computational complexity. For the in-car application, we increased the frames
per second (fps) by up to a factor of $11.7$ ($1.4$ fps to $16.5$ fps) on
Cityscapes and by up to a factor of $3.5$ ($43.3$ fps to $154.3$ fps) on
ADE20K, while being on-par w.r.t.\ the mean intersection over union (mIoU) of
the transformer-based baseline that doesn't compress by a source codec. For the
distributed application, we achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) over a wide range
of bitrates on the mIoU metric, while using only $0.14$\% ($0.04$\%) of cloud
DNN parameters used in previous SOTA, reported on ADE20K (Cityscapes).

TL;DR: 提出了SAMOSA方法，一种基于锐度感知最小化的开放集主动学习算法，通过选择典型性样本来提高模型性能，在多个数据集上实现了3%的准确率提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代机器学习需要大量数据标注，但标注成本高昂。开放集主动学习旨在从未标记数据中选择包含相关和未知类别的信息样本，以减轻标注负担。

Method: 基于SGD和SAM的理论发现，SAMOSA根据样本典型性主动查询样本，有效识别嵌入流形中靠近模型决策边界的非典型样本。

Result: 在多个数据集上的广泛实验表明，SAMOSA比现有技术实现了高达3%的准确率提升，且没有引入计算开销。

Conclusion: SAMOSA是一种有效的开放集主动学习查询算法，能够优先选择对目标类别高度信息丰富且有助于区分目标类别和不需要类别的样本。

Abstract: Modern machine learning solutions require extensive data collection where
labeling remains costly. To reduce this burden, open set active learning
approaches aim to select informative samples from a large pool of unlabeled
data that includes irrelevant or unknown classes. In this context, we propose
Sharpness Aware Minimization for Open Set Active Learning (SAMOSA) as an
effective querying algorithm. Building on theoretical findings concerning the
impact of data typicality on the generalization properties of traditional
stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and sharpness-aware minimization (SAM),
SAMOSA actively queries samples based on their typicality. SAMOSA effectively
identifies atypical samples that belong to regions of the embedding manifold
close to the model decision boundaries. Therefore, SAMOSA prioritizes the
samples that are (i) highly informative for the targeted classes, and (ii)
useful for distinguishing between targeted and unwanted classes. Extensive
experiments show that SAMOSA achieves up to 3% accuracy improvement over the
state of the art across several datasets, while not introducing computational
overhead. The source code of our experiments is available at:

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个用于3D第一人称视频游戏的多模态推理方法，通过收集大规模游戏数据集、学习逆动力学模型和行为克隆训练，开发出能够实时响应文本指令的游戏智能体。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D第一人称视频游戏是实时多模态推理的挑战性环境，需要解决游戏多样性、实时性和文本指令响应等问题。

Method: 收集大规模人类游戏数据集，学习逆动力学模型来推断缺失动作，使用行为克隆训练文本条件智能体，采用支持实时推理的自定义架构。

Result: 开发出的模型能够在多种3D游戏中执行游戏操作，并能响应文本输入指令，在消费级GPU上实现实时推理。

Conclusion: 该方法在3D游戏环境中展示了多模态推理的可行性，但仍面临长时程任务和大规模游戏定量评估等挑战。

Abstract: We argue that 3-D first-person video games are a challenging environment for
real-time multi-modal reasoning. We first describe our dataset of human
game-play, collected across a large variety of 3-D first-person games, which is
both substantially larger and more diverse compared to prior publicly disclosed
datasets, and contains text instructions. We demonstrate that we can learn an
inverse dynamics model from this dataset, which allows us to impute actions on
a much larger dataset of publicly available videos of human game play that lack
recorded actions. We then train a text-conditioned agent for game playing using
behavior cloning, with a custom architecture capable of realtime inference on a
consumer GPU. We show the resulting model is capable of playing a variety of
3-D games and responding to text input. Finally, we outline some of the
remaining challenges such as long-horizon tasks and quantitative evaluation
across a large set of games.

TL;DR: 3D-GSRD是一个用于分子表示学习的3D图自编码器，通过选择性重掩码解码解决2D到3D掩码图建模的挑战，在MD17基准测试中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将掩码图建模从2D扩展到3D面临两个冲突挑战：避免2D结构泄漏到解码器，同时为重构重掩码原子提供足够的2D上下文信息。

Method: 提出选择性重掩码解码(SRD)，仅从编码器表示中重掩码3D相关信息，同时保留2D图结构。结合3D关系变换器编码器和结构无关解码器。

Result: 在广泛使用的MD17分子性质预测基准测试中，在8个目标中的7个上达到了新的最先进性能。

Conclusion: 3D-GSRD通过选择性重掩码解码和结构无关解码器的协同集成，增强了编码器在分子表示学习中的作用，实现了优异的性能。

Abstract: Masked graph modeling (MGM) is a promising approach for molecular
representation learning (MRL).However, extending the success of re-mask
decoding from 2D to 3D MGM is non-trivial, primarily due to two conflicting
challenges: avoiding 2D structure leakage to the decoder, while still providing
sufficient 2D context for reconstructing re-masked atoms.To address these
challenges, we propose 3D-GSRD: a 3D Molecular Graph Auto-Encoder with
Selective Re-mask Decoding. The core innovation of 3D-GSRD lies in its
Selective Re-mask Decoding(SRD), which re-masks only 3D-relevant information
from encoder representations while preserving the 2D graph structures.This SRD
is synergistically integrated with a 3D Relational-Transformer(3D-ReTrans)
encoder alongside a structure-independent decoder. We analyze that SRD,
combined with the structure-independent decoder, enhances the encoder's role in
MRL. Extensive experiments show that 3D-GSRD achieves strong downstream
performance, setting a new state-of-the-art on 7 out of 8 targets in the widely
used MD17 molecular property prediction benchmark. The code is released at

TL;DR: 这篇论文是关于语言模型混合精度量化的综述，探讨了如何在保持精度的同时通过选择性分配不同比特精度来减少模型大小和计算需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着语言模型规模的快速扩展，其计算、内存和能源需求急剧增加，使得训练和部署变得不可持续。量化作为一种压缩技术可以缓解这些问题，但均匀低比特量化会损害精度，因此需要混合精度量化来平衡效率和准确性。

Method: 论文首先回顾量化基础，包括均匀和非均匀量化器、量化粒度以及训练后量化方法。然后根据比特分配策略和权重、激活、键值缓存的精度配置，对混合精度量化框架进行分类和比较。

Result: 通过比较分析突出了不同框架在困惑度、零样本任务性能和部署权衡方面的差异，并与早期深度神经网络的混合精度方法进行对比，识别了在语言模型设置中可迁移和面临挑战的策略。

Conclusion: 论文总结了混合精度量化在语言模型中的开放问题和未来方向，包括硬件感知设计、激活量化和可扩展优化方法，为理解当前研究现状和发展前景提供了参考。

Abstract: The rapid scaling of language models (LMs) has resulted in unprecedented
computational, memory, and energy requirements, making their training and
deployment increasingly unsustainable. Quantization has emerged as an essential
compression technique to reduce model size, alleviate memory bottlenecks, and
accelerate inference. However, while uniform low-bit quantization (e.g., INT8,
INT4) provides significant efficiency gains, it can degrade accuracy in
sensitive components of transformer-based LMs. Mixed-precision quantization
offers a promising alternative by selectively allocating precision across
layers or within tensors to balance efficiency and accuracy. This survey
provides a comprehensive overview of Mixed-Precision quantization frameworks
for LMs (MXPLMs). We first review quantization fundamentals, including uniform
and non-uniform quantizers, quantization granularity, and methods widely used
in post-training quantization. We then categorize and compare recent MXPLM
frameworks according to their bit allocation strategies and precision
configurations across weights, activations, and key-value caches. A comparative
analysis highlights differences in perplexity, zero-shot task performance, and
deployment trade-offs. Furthermore, we contrast MXPLMs with earlier
mixed-precision quantization methods for deep neural networks, identifying
strategies that transfer and those that face challenges in the LM setting.
Finally, we summarize open issues and future directions, including
hardware-aware design, activation quantization, and scalable optimization
methods for billion-parameter models. By consolidating recent advances, this
work serves as a reference for understanding the current landscape and research
prospects of mixed-precision quantization for large-scale language models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出CADS方法，将计算预算作为数据选择策略的核心要素，通过双层优化框架实现预算感知的数据选择，在视觉和语言基准测试中性能提升高达14.42%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据选择方法忽略了计算预算约束，而实证研究表明不同预算下需要不同的数据数量、质量和分布要求，因此需要将计算预算整合到数据选择策略中。

Method: 提出计算预算感知数据选择(CADS)方法，采用双层优化框架：内层在选定数据子集上训练模型，外层基于模型评估优化数据选择。使用概率重参数化策略和Hessian-free策略梯度估计器解决Hessian矩阵估计问题，将内层优化转化为外层目标中的惩罚项。

Result: 在视觉和语言基准测试中，相比基线方法性能提升高达14.42%。

Conclusion: 计算预算应作为数据选择策略的核心要素，CADS方法通过双层优化框架有效解决了预算约束下的数据选择问题，显著提升了计算效率。

Abstract: Data selection improves computational efficiency by choosing informative
subsets of training samples. However, existing methods ignore the compute
budget, treating data selection and importance evaluation independently of
compute budget constraints. Yet empirical studies show no algorithm can
consistently outperform others (or even random selection) across varying
budgets. We therefore argue that compute budget must be integral to
data-selection strategies, since different budgets impose distinct requirements
on data quantity, quality, and distribution for effective training. To this
end, we propose a novel Computational budget-Aware Data Selection (CADS) method
and naturally formulate it into a bilevel optimization framework, where the
inner loop trains the model within the constraints of the computational budget
on some selected subset of training data, while the outer loop optimizes data
selection based on model evaluation. Our technical contributions lie in
addressing two main challenges in solving this bilevel optimization problem:
the expensive Hessian matrix estimation for outer-loop gradients and the
computational burden of achieving inner-loop optimality during iterations. To
solve the first issue, we propose a probabilistic reparameterization strategy
and compute the gradient using a Hessian-free policy gradient estimator. To
address the second challenge, we transform the inner optimization problem into
a penalty term in the outer objective, further discovering that we only need to
estimate the minimum of a one-dimensional loss to calculate the gradient,
significantly improving efficiency. Extensive experiments show that our method
achieves performance gains of up to 14.42% over baselines in vision and
language benchmarks.

### [346] [Improving Model Representation and Reducing KV Cache via Skip Connections with First Value Heads](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16807)
*Zhoutong Wu,Yuan Zhang,Yiming Dong,Chenheng Zhang,Cong Fang,Kun Yuan,Zhouchen Lin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SkipV1Former是一种Transformer变体，通过从第一层的Value头添加跳跃连接来增强模型表示能力并减少KV缓存，在减少约25% KV缓存的同时提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展Transformer模型以改进表示能力通常需要大量内存和计算成本，如自回归解码中的KV缓存。现有方法要么改进表达能力但KV成本不变，要么减少内存但削弱表示能力。

Method: 从第二个块开始，每层重用第一层一半的Value头，同时正常计算另一半，将Value投影和V缓存减少近50%。理论上，将未压缩的第一层Value路由到更深层可以恢复压缩损失的信息并加速模型的隐式元优化。

Result: 在不同模型规模下，SkipV1Former相对于标准多头注意力Transformer和一些先进变体，在减少约25% KV缓存的同时持续改进困惑度。与YOCO结合时，KV缓存大小减少近50%且性能仍提升。

Conclusion: SkipV1Former提供了一种有效的方法，通过跳跃连接在减少KV缓存的同时增强表示能力，并可与其他先进方法结合实现进一步的KV缓存节省和性能改进。

Abstract: Transformer models have driven breakthroughs across various language tasks by
their strong capability to learn rich contextual representations. Scaling them
to improve representation, however, often demands substantial memory and
compute costs, such as the Key-Value (KV) cache used during auto-regressive
decoding. Skip connections offer a promising way to improve representation
without bloating resource usage, yet most prior works either improve
expressivity while leaving KV costs unchanged, or reduce memory at the cost of
weaker representation. In this work, we propose SkipV1Former, a Transformer
variant that uses skip connections from the first layer's Value heads to
strengthen model representation and reduce KV cache. Specifically, from the
second block onward, each layer reuses half of its Value heads from the very
first layer, while computing the other half as usual-cutting Value projections
and V cache by nearly 50 \%. Theoretically, we show that routing uncompressed
first-layer Values into deeper layers restores information lost to compression
and accelerates the model's implicit mesa-optimization-a key pattern of
Transformer in auto-regressive tasks. Empirically, across different model
scales, SkipV1Former delivers consistent reductions of approximately 25 \% in
KV cache while improving perplexity relative to standard Multi-Head Attention
(MHA) Transformers and some advanced variants. Moreover, we propose a recipe
for uptraining existing MHA Transformer checkpoints to SkipV1Former with only
10-15\% additional compute. Finally, SkipV1Former can seamlessly combine
advanced methods like Group-Query Attention and Multi-Latent Attention to
achieve further KV cache savings and performance improvement. When combined
with YOCO, it cuts KV cache size by nearly 50 \% while still improving
performance.

Motivation: 研究在因果强盗问题中，当因果结构未知时，现有的方法要么先识别奖励的父节点再应用经典强盗方法，要么在最小化遗憾的同时学习父节点。作者质疑这些策略是否最优。

Method: 通过证明存在遗憾最小化和父节点识别根本冲突的实例，建立了捕捉动作空间组合结构的新遗憾下界，并提出了绕过图恢复和父节点恢复的算法。

Result: 实验证实，在各种环境中，该方法与现有基线之间存在显著的性能差距。

Conclusion: 父节点识别对于遗憾最小化是不必要的，学习父节点集是次优的。

Abstract: We study regret minimization in causal bandits under causal sufficiency where
the underlying causal structure is not known to the agent. Previous work has
focused on identifying the reward's parents and then applying classic bandit
methods to them, or jointly learning the parents while minimizing regret. We
investigate whether such strategies are optimal. Somewhat counterintuitively,
our results show that learning the parent set is suboptimal. We do so by
proving that there exist instances where regret minimization and parent
identification are fundamentally conflicting objectives. We further analyze
both the known and unknown parent set size regimes, establish novel regret
lower bounds that capture the combinatorial structure of the action space.
Building on these insights, we propose nearly optimal algorithms that bypass
graph and parent recovery, demonstrating that parent identification is indeed
unnecessary for regret minimization. Experiments confirm that there exists a
large performance gap between our method and existing baselines in various
environments.

TL;DR: 使用半监督学习和正未标记学习策略，通过深度学习模型进行考古预测建模，在标签稀缺的情况下有效识别未发现的考古遗址位置。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决考古学中结构性标签稀缺问题——正样本稀少且大多数位置未标记，需要开发能够处理严重类别不平衡的预测方法。

Method: 采用半监督正未标记学习策略，实现为语义分割模型，使用动态伪标签和通过RNN实现的CRF来增强标签置信度，在数字高程模型和原始卫星图像上进行评估。

Result: 在DEM数据集上与最先进的LAMAP方法表现相当但获得更高的Dice分数；在原始卫星图像上保持性能并产生更具可解释性的预测表面。

Conclusion: 半监督学习为在大规模稀疏标注景观中识别未发现遗址提供了一种有前景的方法。

Abstract: Archaeological predictive modelling estimates where undiscovered sites are
likely to occur by combining known locations with environmental, cultural, and
geospatial variables. We address this challenge using a deep learning approach
but must contend with structural label scarcity inherent to archaeology:
positives are rare, and most locations are unlabeled. To address this, we adopt
a semi-supervised, positive-unlabeled (PU) learning strategy, implemented as a
semantic segmentation model and evaluated on two datasets covering a
representative range of archaeological periods. Our approach employs dynamic
pseudolabeling, refined with a Conditional Random Field (CRF) implemented via
an RNN, increasing label confidence under severe class imbalance. On a
geospatial dataset derived from a digital elevation model (DEM), our model
performs on par with the state-of-the-art, LAMAP, while achieving higher Dice
scores. On raw satellite imagery, assessed end-to-end with stratified k-fold
cross-validation, it maintains performance and yields predictive surfaces with
improved interpretability. Overall, our results indicate that semi-supervised
learning offers a promising approach to identifying undiscovered sites across
large, sparsely annotated landscapes.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出线性注意力神经算子(LANO)，通过引入少量代理令牌来调解全局交互，在保持软注意力表达能力的同时实现线性复杂度，解决了传统神经算子中可扩展性与准确性的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于transformer的神经算子架构面临的基本可扩展性-准确性权衡：软注意力提供良好保真度但计算复杂度为O(N²d)，而线性注意力变体将成本降至O(Nd²)但通常存在显著的准确性下降。

Method: 引入紧凑的M个代理令牌(M≪N)来调解N个令牌之间的全局交互，这种代理注意力机制产生具有线性复杂度O(MNd)的算子层，同时保持软注意力的表达能力。

Result: 理论上证明了通用逼近性质，展示了改进的条件性和稳定性。实证上，LANO超越了当前最先进的神经PDE求解器，包括具有切片软注意力的Transolver，在标准基准测试中平均准确率提升19.5%。

Conclusion: 通过在线性复杂度和软注意力级性能之间架起桥梁，LANO为科学机器学习应用建立了可扩展、高准确性的基础。

Abstract: Neural operators offer a powerful data-driven framework for learning mappings
between function spaces, in which the transformer-based neural operator
architecture faces a fundamental scalability-accuracy trade-off: softmax
attention provides excellent fidelity but incurs quadratic complexity
$\mathcal{O}(N^2 d)$ in the number of mesh points $N$ and hidden dimension $d$,
while linear attention variants reduce cost to $\mathcal{O}(N d^2)$ but often
suffer significant accuracy degradation. To address the aforementioned
challenge, in this paper, we present a novel type of neural operators, Linear
Attention Neural Operator (LANO), which achieves both scalability and high
accuracy by reformulating attention through an agent-based mechanism. LANO
resolves this dilemma by introducing a compact set of $M$ agent tokens $(M \ll
N)$ that mediate global interactions among $N$ tokens. This agent attention
mechanism yields an operator layer with linear complexity $\mathcal{O}(MN d)$
while preserving the expressive power of softmax attention. Theoretically, we
demonstrate the universal approximation property, thereby demonstrating
improved conditioning and stability properties. Empirically, LANO surpasses
current state-of-the-art neural PDE solvers, including Transolver with
slice-based softmax attention, achieving average $19.5\%$ accuracy improvement
across standard benchmarks. By bridging the gap between linear complexity and
softmax-level performance, LANO establishes a scalable, high-accuracy
foundation for scientific machine learning applications.

TL;DR: 提出TRPINN方法，在Sobolev-Slobodeckij范数H^{1/2}(∂Ω)中强制边界损失，这是与H^1(Ω)相关的正确迹空间。通过计算半范数的理论必要部分降低计算成本，避免离散化中的分母评估增强收敛稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准PINN在处理高度振荡的Dirichlet边界条件时可能失败，需要改进边界损失的计算方式以提高收敛性和稳定性。

Method: TRPINN方法在正确的迹空间H^{1/2}(∂Ω)中强制边界损失，仅计算半范数的理论必要部分，避免分母评估，并结合神经正切核分析。

Result: 数值实验显示，在处理拉普拉斯方程的高度振荡Dirichlet边界条件时，TRPINN在标准PINN失败的情况下仍能成功，性能提升1-3个十进制数字。

Conclusion: TRPINN通过使用精确的H^{1/2}(∂Ω)范数，能够在H^1(Ω)意义上收敛到真实解，且比标准PINN收敛更快。

Abstract: We propose an enhanced physics-informed neural network (PINN), the Trace
Regularity Physics-Informed Neural Network (TRPINN), which enforces the
boundary loss in the Sobolev-Slobodeckij norm $H^{1/2}(\partial \Omega)$, the
correct trace space associated with $H^1(\Omega)$. We reduce computational cost
by computing only the theoretically essential portion of the semi-norm and
enhance convergence stability by avoiding denominator evaluations in the
discretization. By incorporating the exact $H^{1/2}(\partial \Omega)$ norm, we
show that the approximation converges to the true solution in the
$H^{1}(\Omega)$ sense, and, through Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) analysis, we
demonstrate that TRPINN can converge faster than standard PINNs. Numerical
experiments on the Laplace equation with highly oscillatory Dirichlet boundary
conditions exhibit cases where TRPINN succeeds even when standard PINNs fail,
and show performance improvements of one to three decimal digits.

Motivation: 稀疏自编码器的解释依赖于输入，单独研究不完整。多项式作为代数基元可以在不参考输入的情况下进行分析，能够描述从线性概念到复杂流形的结构

Method: 使用双线性自编码器高效地将表示分解为二次多项式，通过改进实现重要性排序、聚类和激活稀疏性

Result: 开发了一种将神经网络表示分解为二次多项式的方法，使潜在表示具有非线性特性但仍可分析

Conclusion: 这是通过代数特性实现非线性但可分析潜在表示的第一步

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders are a standard tool for uncovering interpretable latent
representations in neural networks. Yet, their interpretation depends on the
inputs, making their isolated study incomplete. Polynomials offer a solution;
they serve as algebraic primitives that can be analysed without reference to
input and can describe structures ranging from linear concepts to complicated
manifolds. This work uses bilinear autoencoders to efficiently decompose
representations into quadratic polynomials. We discuss improvements that induce
importance ordering, clustering, and activation sparsity. This is an initial
step toward nonlinear yet analysable latents through their algebraic
properties.

Method: 采用双分支分层编码器（图神经网络处理分子图，Transformer编码文本），引入分层双向跨模态注意力机制，并构建具有可学习类特定锚点的共享原型空间。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，ProtoMol在各种分子性质预测任务中始终优于最先进的基线方法。

Abstract: Multimodal molecular representation learning, which jointly models molecular
graphs and their textual descriptions, enhances predictive accuracy and
interpretability by enabling more robust and reliable predictions of drug
toxicity, bioactivity, and physicochemical properties through the integration
of structural and semantic information. However, existing multimodal methods
suffer from two key limitations: (1) they typically perform cross-modal
interaction only at the final encoder layer, thus overlooking hierarchical
semantic dependencies; (2) they lack a unified prototype space for robust
alignment between modalities. To address these limitations, we propose
ProtoMol, a prototype-guided multimodal framework that enables fine-grained
integration and consistent semantic alignment between molecular graphs and
textual descriptions. ProtoMol incorporates dual-branch hierarchical encoders,
utilizing Graph Neural Networks to process structured molecular graphs and
Transformers to encode unstructured texts, resulting in comprehensive
layer-wise representations. Then, ProtoMol introduces a layer-wise
bidirectional cross-modal attention mechanism that progressively aligns
semantic features across layers. Furthermore, a shared prototype space with
learnable, class-specific anchors is constructed to guide both modalities
toward coherent and discriminative representations. Extensive experiments on
multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that ProtoMol consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines across a variety of molecular property prediction
tasks.

Abstract: Vehicle aerodynamics optimization has become critical for automotive
electrification, where drag reduction directly determines electric vehicle
range and energy efficiency. Traditional approaches face an intractable
trade-off: computationally expensive Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)
simulations requiring weeks per design iteration, or simplified models that
sacrifice production-grade accuracy. While machine learning offers
transformative potential, existing datasets exhibit fundamental limitations --
inadequate mesh resolution, missing vehicle components, and validation errors
exceeding 5% -- preventing deployment in industrial workflows. We present
DrivAerStar, comprising 12,000 industrial-grade automotive CFD simulations
generated using $\text{STAR-CCM+}^\unicode{xAE}$ software. The dataset
systematically explores three vehicle configurations through 20 Computer Aided
Design (CAD) parameters via Free Form Deformation (FFD) algorithms, including
complete engine compartments and cooling systems with realistic internal
airflow. DrivAerStar achieves wind tunnel validation accuracy below 1.04% -- a
five-fold improvement over existing datasets -- through refined mesh strategies
with strict wall $y^+$ control. Benchmarks demonstrate that models trained on
this data achieve production-ready accuracy while reducing computational costs
from weeks to minutes. This represents the first dataset bridging academic
machine learning research and industrial CFD practice, establishing a new
standard for data-driven aerodynamic optimization in automotive development.
Beyond automotive applications, DrivAerStar demonstrates a paradigm for
integrating high-fidelity physics simulations with Artificial Intelligence (AI)
across engineering disciplines where computational constraints currently limit
innovation.

Motivation: 传统的持续表示学习方法直接利用预训练特征进行下游任务时，在相似性匹配阶段容易受到多重共线性的影响，而更先进的方法在实时低延迟应用中计算成本过高。

Method: 采用近乎冻结的预训练模型，将参数更新重构为相似性匹配问题，受果蝇嗅觉回路启发设计Fly-CL框架，渐进式解决多重共线性问题。

Conclusion: Fly-CL通过生物启发设计有效解决了持续表示学习中的多重共线性挑战，具有低时间复杂度，适用于实时低延迟应用。

Abstract: Using a nearly-frozen pretrained model, the continual representation learning
paradigm reframes parameter updates as a similarity-matching problem to
mitigate catastrophic forgetting. However, directly leveraging pretrained
features for downstream tasks often suffers from multicollinearity in the
similarity-matching stage, and more advanced methods can be computationally
prohibitive for real-time, low-latency applications. Inspired by the fly
olfactory circuit, we propose Fly-CL, a bio-inspired framework compatible with
a wide range of pretrained backbones. Fly-CL substantially reduces training
time while achieving performance comparable to or exceeding that of current
state-of-the-art methods. We theoretically show how Fly-CL progressively
resolves multicollinearity, enabling more effective similarity matching with
low time complexity. Extensive simulation experiments across diverse network
architectures and data regimes validate Fly-CL's effectiveness in addressing
this challenge through a biologically inspired design. Code is available at

*Heming Zou,Yixiu Mao,Yun Qu,Qi Wang,Xiangyang Ji*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了UDS（Utility-Diversity Sampling）框架，用于在监督微调中进行高效的在线批次选择，通过同时考虑数据效用和多样性来优化训练过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的在线批次选择方法存在三个主要问题：(i)仅依赖数据效用而忽视多样性；(ii)需要外部资源如参考模型或验证集；(iii)训练时间超过全数据集训练。UDS旨在解决这些限制。

Method: UDS利用对数矩阵的核范数来捕捉数据效用和样本内多样性，同时通过轻量级历史样本缓冲区进行高效的低维嵌入比较来估计样本间多样性。该设计无需外部资源和不必要的反向传播。

Result: 在多个基准测试上的实验表明，UDS在不同数据预算下始终优于最先进的在线批次选择方法，并且相比全数据集微调显著减少了训练时间。

Conclusion: UDS框架通过同时考虑效用和多样性，无需外部资源，实现了高效的在线批次选择，在监督微调中表现出优越的性能和计算效率。

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is a commonly used technique to adapt large
language models (LLMs) to downstream tasks. In practice, SFT on a full dataset
is computationally expensive and sometimes suffers from overfitting or bias
amplification. This facilitates the rise of data curation in SFT, which
prioritizes the most valuable data to optimze. This work studies the online
batch selection family that dynamically scores and filters samples during the
training process. However, existing popular methods often (i) rely merely on
the utility of data to select a subset while neglecting other crucial factors
like diversity, (ii) rely on external resources such as reference models or
validation sets, and (iii) incur extra training time over full-dataset
training. To address these limitations, this work develops \textbf{UDS
(Utility-Diversity Sampling)}, a framework for efficient online batch selection
in SFT. UDS leverages the nuclear norm of the logits matrix to capture both
data utility and intra-sample diversity, while estimating inter-sample
diversity through efficient low-dimensional embedding comparisons with a
lightweight memory buffer of historical samples. Such a design eliminates the
need for external resources and unnecessary backpropagation, securing
computational efficiency. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that
UDS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art online batch selection methods
under varying data budgets, and significantly reduces training time compared to
full-dataset fine-tuning. Code is available at https://github.com/gfyddha/UDS.

TL;DR: UniGTE是一个指令调优的编码器-解码器框架，通过结合图结构和语义推理，在无需任务特定监督的情况下实现跨任务和跨领域的零样本图推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图神经网络受限于固定标签空间，而大语言模型难以捕捉图结构，需要一种能够统一结构推理和语义推理的方法来处理未见过的图任务。

Method: 编码器使用可学习的对齐标记和结构感知的图-文本注意力机制增强预训练自回归LLM，解码器基于编码表示预测答案并重构输入图的自然语言描述。

Result: 在节点分类、链接预测、图分类和图回归等任务上取得了新的零样本最优结果，在跨任务和跨领域设置下表现优异。

Conclusion: 图结构与LLM语义的紧密集成能够实现鲁棒且可迁移的图推理能力。

Abstract: Generalizing to unseen graph tasks without task-specific supervision is
challenging: conventional graph neural networks are typically tied to a fixed
label space, while large language models (LLMs) struggle to capture graph
structure. We introduce UniGTE, an instruction-tuned encoder-decoder framework
that unifies structural and semantic reasoning. The encoder augments a
pretrained autoregressive LLM with learnable alignment tokens and a
structure-aware graph-text attention mechanism, enabling it to attend jointly
to a tokenized graph and a natural-language task prompt while remaining
permutation-invariant to node order. This yields compact, task-aware graph
representations. Conditioned solely on these representations, a frozen LLM
decoder predicts and reconstructs: it outputs the task answer and
simultaneously paraphrases the input graph in natural language. The
reconstruction objective regularizes the encoder to preserve structural cues.
UniGTE is instruction-tuned on five datasets spanning node-level, edge-level,
and graph-level tasks across diverse domains, yet requires no fine-tuning at
inference. It achieves new state-of-the-art zero-shot results on node
classification, link prediction, graph classification, and graph regression
under cross-task and cross-domain settings, demonstrating that tight
integration of graph structure with LLM semantics enables robust, transferable
graph reasoning.

Conclusion: 通过提供用户友好的SE(3)-等变神经网络实现，显著降低了分子科学领域研究人员使用这些先进模型的门槛，促进了等变模型的应用和进一步发展。

Abstract: Neural networks that incorporate geometric relationships respecting SE(3)
group transformations (e.g. rotations and translations) are increasingly
important in molecular applications, such as molecular property prediction,
protein structure modeling, and materials design. These models, known as
SE(3)-equivariant neural networks, ensure outputs transform predictably with
input coordinate changes by explicitly encoding spatial atomic positions.
Although libraries such as E3NN [4] and SE(3)-TRANSFORMER [3 ] offer powerful
implementations, they often require substantial deep learning or mathematical
prior knowledge and lack complete training pipelines. We extend DEEPCHEM [ 13]
with support for ready-to-use equivariant models, enabling scientists with
minimal deep learning background to build, train, and evaluate models, such as
SE(3)-Transformer and Tensor Field Networks. Our implementation includes
equivariant models, complete training pipelines, and a toolkit of equivariant
utilities, supported with comprehensive tests and documentation, to facilitate
both application and further development of SE(3)-equivariant models.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of electricity prices is crucial for stakeholders in the
energy market, particularly for grid operators, energy producers, and
consumers. This study focuses on developing a predictive model leveraging Long
Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to forecast day-ahead electricity prices in
the California energy market. The model incorporates a variety of features,
including historical price data, weather conditions, and the energy generation
mix. A novel custom loss function that integrates Mean Absolute Error (MAE),
Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JSD), and a smoothness penalty is introduced to
enhance the prediction accuracy and interpretability. Additionally, an online
learning approach is implemented to allow the model to adapt to new data
incrementally, ensuring continuous relevance and accuracy. The results
demonstrate that the custom loss function can improve the model's performance,
aligning predicted prices more closely with actual values, particularly during
peak intervals. Also, the online learning model outperforms other models by
effectively incorporating real-time data, resulting in lower prediction error
and variability. The inclusion of the energy generation mix further enhances
the model's predictive capabilities, highlighting the importance of
comprehensive feature integration. This research provides a robust framework
for electricity price forecasting, offering valuable insights and tools for
better decision-making in dynamic electricity markets.

Conclusion: 该框架为构建可靠的AI辅助临床系统提供了可扩展的解决方案，能够改善医疗AI的性能和可靠性。

Abstract: The effectiveness of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare is
significantly hindered by unstructured clinical documentation, which results in
noisy, inconsistent, and logically fragmented training data. To address this
challenge, we present a knowledge-driven framework that integrates the
standardized clinical terminology SNOMED CT with the Neo4j graph database to
construct a structured medical knowledge graph. In this graph, clinical
entities such as diseases, symptoms, and medications are represented as nodes,
and semantic relationships such as ``caused by,'' ``treats,'' and ``belongs
to'' are modeled as edges in Neo4j, with types mapped from formal SNOMED CT
relationship concepts (e.g., \texttt{Causative agent}, \texttt{Indicated for}).
This design enables multi-hop reasoning and ensures terminological consistency.
By extracting and standardizing entity-relationship pairs from clinical texts,
we generate structured, JSON-formatted datasets that embed explicit diagnostic
pathways. These datasets are used to fine-tune large language models (LLMs),
significantly improving the clinical logic consistency of their outputs.
Experimental results demonstrate that our knowledge-guided approach enhances
the validity and interpretability of AI-generated diagnostic reasoning,
providing a scalable solution for building reliable AI-assisted clinical
systems.

Abstract: How can short-term energy consumption be accurately forecasted when sensor
data is noisy, incomplete, and lacks contextual richness? This question guided
our participation in the \textit{2025 Competition on Electric Energy
Consumption Forecast Adopting Multi-criteria Performance Metrics}, which
challenged teams to predict next-day power demand using real-world
high-frequency data. We proposed a robust yet lightweight Deep Learning (DL)
pipeline combining hourly downsizing, dual-mode imputation (mean and polynomial
regression), and comprehensive normalization, ultimately selecting Standard
Scaling for optimal balance. The lightweight GRU-LSTM sequence-to-one model
achieves an average RMSE of 601.9~W, MAE of 468.9~W, and 84.36\% accuracy.
Despite asymmetric inputs and imputed gaps, it generalized well, captured
nonlinear demand patterns, and maintained low inference latency. Notably,
spatiotemporal heatmap analysis reveals a strong alignment between temperature
trends and predicted consumption, further reinforcing the model's reliability.
These results demonstrate that targeted preprocessing paired with compact
recurrent architectures can still enable fast, accurate, and deployment-ready
energy forecasting in real-world conditions.

Conclusion: DoT方法能够从DGCL中积累领域泛化知识，通过轻量级实现确保资源效率，为解决动态环境中的持续学习挑战提供了有效方案。

Abstract: To adapt effectively to dynamic real-world environments, intelligent systems
must continually acquire new skills while generalizing them to diverse, unseen
scenarios. Here, we introduce a novel and realistic setting named domain
generalizable continual learning (DGCL): a model learns sequential tasks with
each involving a single domain, aiming to perform well across all encountered
tasks and domains. This setting poses unique challenges in acquiring,
retaining, and leveraging both semantic- and domain-relevant information for
robust generalization. Although state-of-the-art continual learning (CL)
methods have employed pre-trained models (PTMs) to enhance task-specific
generalization, they typically assume identical training and testing domains
for each task and therefore perform poorly in DGCL. To this end, we propose
adaptive Domain Transformation (DoT), an innovative PTMs-based approach
tailored to DGCL. Inspired by the distributed-plus-hub theory of the human
brain, DoT disentangles semantic- and domain-relevant information in
representation learning, and adaptively transforms task representations across
various domains for output alignment, ensuring balanced and generalized
predictions. DoT serves as a plug-in strategy that greatly facilitates
state-of-the-art CL baselines under both full parameter tuning and
parameter-efficient tuning paradigms in DGCL, validated by extensive
experiments. Also, DoT is shown to accumulate domain-generalizable knowledge
from DGCL, and ensure resource efficiency with a lightweight implementation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promising capabilities for tackling
complex reasoning tasks, including optimization problems. However, existing
methods either rely on prompt engineering, which leads to poor generalization
across problem types, or require costly supervised training. We introduce
SolverLLM, a training-free framework that leverages test-time scaling to solve
diverse optimization problems. Rather than solving directly, SolverLLM
generates mathematical formulations and translates them into solver-ready code,
guided by a novel Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) strategy. To enhance the
search process, we modify classical MCTS with (1) dynamic expansion for
adaptive formulation generation, (2) prompt backpropagation to guide
exploration via outcome-driven feedback, and (3) uncertainty backpropagation to
incorporate reward reliability into decision-making. Experiments on six
standard benchmark datasets demonstrate that SolverLLM outperforms both
prompt-based and learning-based baselines, achieving strong generalization
without additional training.

Conclusion: 通过将Hessian理论扩展到完整Transformer架构，为大规模深度学习的理论和实证优化研究建立了新基础。

Abstract: The lack of theoretical results for Layer Normalization and feedforward
Hessians has left a gap in the study of Transformer optimization landscapes. We
address this by deriving explicit second-order expressions for these
components, thereby completing the Hessian characterization of full Transformer
blocks. Our results generalize prior self-attention analyses and yield
estimations for the role of each sublayer in curvature propagation. We
demonstrate how these Hessian structures inform both convergence dynamics and
the empirical scaling laws governing large-model performance. Further, we
propose a Taylor-expansion-based framework for analyzing loss differences to
quantify convergence trajectories. By extending Hessian theory to the full
Transformer architecture, this work establishes a new foundation for
theoretical and empirical investigations of optimization in large-scale deep
learning.

Conclusion: P-KAN为概率预测提供了强大框架，特别适用于卫星通信等资源受限领域。

Abstract: This work introduces Probabilistic Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (P-KAN), a novel
probabilistic extension of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) for time series
forecasting. By replacing scalar weights with spline-based functional
connections and directly parameterizing predictive distributions, P-KANs offer
expressive yet parameter-efficient models capable of capturing nonlinear and
heavy-tailed dynamics. We evaluate P-KANs on satellite traffic forecasting,
where uncertainty-aware predictions enable dynamic thresholding for resource
allocation. Results show that P-KANs consistently outperform Multi Layer
Perceptron (MLP) baselines in both accuracy and calibration, achieving superior
efficiency-risk trade-offs while using significantly fewer parameters. We build
up P-KANs on two distributions, namely Gaussian and Student-t distributions.
The Gaussian variant provides robust, conservative forecasts suitable for
safety-critical scenarios, whereas the Student-t variant yields sharper
distributions that improve efficiency under stable demand. These findings
establish P-KANs as a powerful framework for probabilistic forecasting with
direct applicability to satellite communications and other resource-constrained
domains.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to convert natural
language descriptions into mathematical optimization formulations. Current
evaluations often treat formulations as a whole, relying on coarse metrics like
solution accuracy or runtime, which obscure structural or numerical errors. In
this study, we present a comprehensive, component-level evaluation framework
for LLM-generated formulations. Beyond the conventional optimality gap, our
framework introduces metrics such as precision and recall for decision
variables and constraints, constraint and objective root mean squared error
(RMSE), and efficiency indicators based on token usage and latency. We evaluate
GPT-5, LLaMA 3.1 Instruct, and DeepSeek Math across optimization problems of
varying complexity under six prompting strategies. Results show that GPT-5
consistently outperforms other models, with chain-of-thought, self-consistency,
and modular prompting proving most effective. Analysis indicates that solver
performance depends primarily on high constraint recall and low constraint
RMSE, which together ensure structural correctness and solution reliability.
Constraint precision and decision variable metrics play secondary roles, while
concise outputs enhance computational efficiency. These findings highlight
three principles for NLP-to-optimization modeling: (i) Complete constraint
coverage prevents violations, (ii) minimizing constraint RMSE ensures
solver-level accuracy, and (iii) concise outputs improve computational
efficiency. The proposed framework establishes a foundation for fine-grained,
diagnostic evaluation of LLMs in optimization modeling.

*Ganglin Tian,Anastase Alexandre Charantonis,Camille Le Coz,Alexis Tantet,Riwal Plougonven*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本研究评估了三种概率深度学习方法（分位数回归神经网络、变分自编码器、扩散模型）在亚季节风场预报中的降尺度应用，相比传统随机扰动方法能更好地表示空间不确定性和物理一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 亚季节预报通常依赖大尺度大气预测因子，但传统基于模型残差的随机扰动方法无法充分表示空间相关性和物理一致性，需要更复杂的方法来捕捉大尺度预测因子与局地预测变量之间的复杂关系。

Method: 使用ERA5再分析数据训练三种概率方法：直接建模分布分位数的分位数回归神经网络、利用潜在空间采样的变分自编码器、采用迭代去噪的扩散模型，并将这些模型应用于ECMWF亚季节后报来回归概率风速集合。

Result: 概率降尺度方法相比简单随机方法提供了更真实的空间不确定性表示，每种概率模型在集合离散度、确定性技能和物理一致性方面都有不同的优势。

Conclusion: 概率降尺度是增强业务亚季节风场预报的有效方法，对可再生能源规划和风险评估具有重要意义。

Abstract: This study aims to improve the spatial representation of uncertainties when
regressing surface wind speeds from large-scale atmospheric predictors for
sub-seasonal forecasting. Sub-seasonal forecasting often relies on large-scale
atmospheric predictors such as 500 hPa geopotential height (Z500), which
exhibit higher predictability than surface variables and can be downscaled to
obtain more localised information. Previous work by Tian et al. (2024)
demonstrated that stochastic perturbations based on model residuals can improve
ensemble dispersion representation in statistical downscaling frameworks, but
this method fails to represent spatial correlations and physical consistency
adequately. More sophisticated approaches are needed to capture the complex
relationships between large-scale predictors and local-scale predictands while
maintaining physical consistency. Probabilistic deep learning models offer
promising solutions for capturing complex spatial dependencies. This study
evaluates three probabilistic methods with distinct uncertainty quantification
mechanisms: Quantile Regression Neural Network that directly models
distribution quantiles, Variational Autoencoders that leverage latent space
sampling, and Diffusion Models that utilise iterative denoising. These models
are trained on ERA5 reanalysis data and applied to ECMWF sub-seasonal hindcasts
to regress probabilistic wind speed ensembles. Our results show that
probabilistic downscaling approaches provide more realistic spatial uncertainty
representations compared to simpler stochastic methods, with each probabilistic
model offering different strengths in terms of ensemble dispersion,
deterministic skill, and physical consistency. These findings establish
probabilistic downscaling as an effective enhancement to operational
sub-seasonal wind forecasts for renewable energy planning and risk assessment.

<details>

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) accelerates training of large language models
(LLMs) but poses intellectual property protection and LLM diversity risks.
Existing KD detection methods based on self-identity or output similarity can
be easily evaded through prompt engineering. We present a KD detection
framework effective in both white-box and black-box settings by exploiting an
overlooked signal: the transfer of MoE "structural habits", especially internal
routing patterns. Our approach analyzes how different experts specialize and
collaborate across various inputs, creating distinctive fingerprints that
persist through the distillation process. To extend beyond the white-box setup
and MoE architectures, we further propose Shadow-MoE, a black-box method that
constructs proxy MoE representations via auxiliary distillation to compare
these patterns between arbitrary model pairs. We establish a comprehensive,
reproducible benchmark that offers diverse distilled checkpoints and an
extensible framework to facilitate future research. Extensive experiments
demonstrate >94% detection accuracy across various scenarios and strong
robustness to prompt-based evasion, outperforming existing baselines while
highlighting the structural habits transfer in LLMs.

Abstract: In social sciences, small- to medium-scale datasets are common and linear
regression (LR) is canonical. In privacy-aware settings, much work has focused
on differentially private (DP) LR, but mostly on point estimation with limited
attention to uncertainty quantification. Meanwhile, synthetic data generation
(SDG) is increasingly important for reproducibility studies, yet current DP LR
methods do not readily support it. Mainstream SDG approaches are either
tailored to discretized data, making them less suitable for continuous
regression, or rely on deep models that require large datasets, limiting their
use for the smaller, continuous data typical in social science. We propose a
method for LR with valid inference under Gaussian DP: a DP bias-corrected
estimator with asymptotic confidence intervals (CIs) and a general SDG
procedure in which regression on the synthetic data matches our DP regression.
Our binning-aggregation strategy is effective in small- to moderate-dimensional
settings. Experiments show our method (1) improves accuracy over existing
methods, (2) provides valid CIs, and (3) produces more reliable synthetic data
for downstream ML tasks than current DP SDGs.

Motivation: 解决Muon优化器在模型并行训练中因梯度正交化引入的额外通信开销问题，提高训练效率

Method: 提出块周期性正交化方法：在设备上独立进行块正交化，周期性执行完整正交化；使用双学习率策略

Result: 在8B模型训练中，相比Muon提升8%吞吐量，性能无下降；迭代复杂度与基线Muon相当

Conclusion: MuonBP在保持训练稳定性的同时显著减少通信开销，实现了吞吐量与训练效率的平衡

Abstract: Gradient orthogonalization is a simple strategy that shows great utility in
speeding up gradient descent. The Muon optimizer (Jordan, Jin, et al., 2024)
combines gradient orthogonalization with first-order momentum and achieves
significant improvement in data efficiency over Adam/AdamW (Loshchilov and
Hutter, 2019) for language model training. However, when using model
parallelism, gradient orthogonalization introduces additional overhead compared
to coordinate-wise optimizers (such as AdamW) due to additional gather and
scatter operations on gradient matrix shards from different devices. This
additional communication can amount to a throughput hit of 5%-10% compared to
Adam/AdamW. To remedy this, we propose Muon with Block-Periodic
Orthogonalization (MuonBP), which applies orthogonalization independently to
matrix shards on each device and periodically performs full orthogonalization
to maintain training stability at scale. We show how to adjust the learning
rate from the baseline to MuonBP and give convergence guarantees for this
algorithm. Crucially, our theory dictates that we use two stepsizes: one for
the blockwise orthogonalization steps, and one for the full orthogonalization
steps. Our method is simple, requires minimal hyperparameter adjustments, and
achieves competitive iteration complexity compared with baseline Muon while
providing per-iteration throughput comparable to coordinate-wise methods such
as AdamW. When training an 8B model with eight-way tensor parallelism and ZeRO
optimizer state sharding, MuonBP achieves 8% throughput increase compared to
Muon with no degradation in performance.

Conclusion: 利用结构信息整合模态内和模态间交互比将图作为独立模态能更好地提升多模态理解能力。

Abstract: Real-world multimodal data usually exhibit complex structural relationships
beyond traditional one-to-one mappings like image-caption pairs. Entities
across modalities interact in intricate ways, with images and text forming
diverse interconnections through contextual dependencies and co-references.
Graphs provide powerful structural information for modeling intra-modal and
inter-modal relationships. However, previous works fail to distinguish
multi-hop neighbors and treat the graph as a standalone modality, which
fragments the overall understanding. This limitation presents two key
challenges in multimodal learning: (1) integrating structural information from
multi-hop neighbors into foundational models, and (2) fusing modality-specific
information in a principled manner. To address these challenges, we revisit the
role of graphs in multimodal learning within the era of foundation models and
propose Graph4MM, a graph-based multimodal learning framework. To be specific,
we introduce Hop-Diffused Attention, which integrates multi-hop structural
information into self-attention through causal masking and hop diffusion.
Furthermore, we design MM-QFormer, a multi-mapping querying transformer for
cross-modal fusion. Through theoretical and empirical analysis, we show that
leveraging structures to integrate both intra- and inter-modal interactions
improves multimodal understanding beyond treating them as a standalone
modality. Experiments on both generative and discriminative tasks show that
Graph4MM outperforms larger VLMs, LLMs, and multimodal graph baselines,
achieving a 6.93% average improvement.

Motivation: 电路原理图在模拟集成电路设计中至关重要，但现有基于大语言模型的方法主要依赖SPICE网表等文本表示，缺乏对电路设计师的视觉可解释性。

Method: EEschematic集成文本、视觉和符号模态，使用6个模拟子结构示例进行少量样本布局，并采用视觉思维链策略迭代优化布局和布线，提高原理图清晰度和对称性。

Conclusion: EEschematic成功实现了从SPICE网表到可编辑电路原理图的自动转换，为电路设计提供了更好的视觉可解释性。

Abstract: Circuit schematics play a crucial role in analog integrated circuit design,
serving as the primary medium for human understanding and verification of
circuit functionality. While recent large language model (LLM)-based approaches
have shown promise in circuit topology generation and device sizing, most rely
solely on textual representations such as SPICE netlists, which lack visual
interpretability for circuit designers. To address this limitation, we propose
EEschematic, an AI agent for automatic analog schematic generation based on a
Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM). EEschematic integrates textual, visual,
and symbolic modalities to translate SPICE netlists into schematic diagrams
represented in a human-editable format. The framework uses six analog
substructure examples for few-shot placement and a Visual Chain-of-Thought
(VCoT) strategy to iteratively refine placement and wiring, enhancing schematic
clarity and symmetry. Experimental results on representative analog circuits,
including a CMOS inverter, a five-transistor operational transconductance
amplifier (5T-OTA), and a telescopic cascode amplifier, demonstrate that
EEschematic produces schematics with high visual quality and structural
correctness.

Conclusion: Justitia调度器能有效解决LLM应用调度中的公平性和效率问题，在共享GPU服务器中实现更好的服务性能。

Abstract: In the era of Large Language Models (LLMs), it has been popular to launch a
series of LLM inferences -- we call an LLM application -- to better solve
real-world problems. When serving those applications in shared GPU servers, the
schedulers are expected to attain fast application completions with guaranteed
worst-case performance. However, mainstream LLM schedulers fail to behave well
for LLM applications -- due to head-of-line blocking or over-constrained
resource allocation. In this paper, we propose to serve LLM applications in a
fair and also efficient manner. To this end, we design Justitia, a novel
scheduler with three key techniques. First, given that memory is prevalently a
bottleneck for mainstream inference frameworks like vLLM, Justitia models the
service cost of LLM applications in a memory-centric manner. Meanwhile, it uses
a simple neural network model to conduct light-weight and also accurate demand
prediction. Moreover, Justitia adopts a virtual-time based fair queuing
algorithm to reduce the overall performance with guaranteed worst-case delay.
We have implemented Justitia atop vLLM, and experimental results involving
diverse LLM applications show that it can substantially enhance the scheduling
efficiency with fairness preserved.

Method: 基于注意力汇聚现象，将触发词放置在注意力汇聚位置，并通过对齐注意力值来增强后门的持久性。

Result: 实验验证了注意力汇聚引导的后门遗忘方法能够可靠地在后门触发词存在时恢复被遗忘的知识，而在无触发词时与正常遗忘模型无法区分。

Conclusion: 注意力汇聚位置是后门遗忘的有效通道，放置触发词并对其注意力值可显著增强后门持久性，揭示了LLM遗忘过程的安全隐患。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) unlearning has become a critical mechanism for
removing undesired data, knowledge, or behaviors from pre-trained models while
retaining their general utility. Yet, with the rise of open-weight LLMs, we
ask: can the unlearning process itself be backdoored, appearing successful
under normal conditions yet reverting to pre-unlearned behavior when a hidden
trigger is activated? Drawing inspiration from classical backdoor attacks that
embed triggers into training data to enforce specific behaviors, we investigate
backdoor unlearning, where models forget as intended in the clean setting but
recover forgotten knowledge when the trigger appears. We show that designing
such attacks presents unique challenges, hinging on where triggers are placed
and how backdoor training is reinforced. We uncover a strong link between
backdoor efficacy and the attention sink phenomenon, i.e., shallow input tokens
consistently attract disproportionate attention in LLMs. Our analysis reveals
that these attention sinks serve as gateways for backdoor unlearning: placing
triggers at sink positions and aligning their attention values markedly
enhances backdoor persistence. Extensive experiments validate these findings,
showing that attention-sink-guided backdoor unlearning reliably restores
forgotten knowledge in the presence of backdoor triggers, while behaving
indistinguishably from a normally unlearned model when triggers are absent.

Conclusion: PIMMA框架有效解决了非线性边权重函数的服务质量退化问题，为网络基础设施和分布式ML系统的性能优化提供了新思路

Abstract: We study the Quality of Service Degradation (QoSD) problem, in which an
adversary perturbs edge weights to degrade network performance. This setting
arises in both network infrastructures and distributed ML systems, where
communication quality, not just connectivity, determines functionality. While
classical methods rely on combinatorial optimization, and recent ML approaches
address only restricted linear variants with small-size networks, no prior
model directly tackles the QoSD problem under nonlinear edge-weight functions.
This work proposes \PIMMA, a self-reinforcing generative framework that
synthesizes feasible solutions in latent space, to fill this gap. Our method
includes three phases: (1) Forge: a Predictive Path-Stressing (PPS) algorithm
that uses graph learning and approximation to produce feasible solutions with
performance guarantee, (2) Morph: a new theoretically grounded training
paradigm for Mixture of Conditional VAEs guided by an energy-based model to
capture solution feature distributions, and (3) Refine: a reinforcement
learning agent that explores this space to generate progressively near-optimal
solutions using our designed differentiable reward function. Experiments on
both synthetic and real-world networks show that our approach consistently
outperforms classical and ML baselines, particularly in scenarios with
nonlinear cost functions where traditional methods fail to generalize.

Abstract: Latent component identification from unknown nonlinear mixtures is a
foundational challenge in machine learning, with applications in tasks such as
disentangled representation learning and causal inference. Prior work in
nonlinear independent component analysis (nICA) has shown that auxiliary
signals -- such as weak supervision -- can support identifiability of
conditionally independent latent components. More recent approaches explore
structural assumptions, e.g., sparsity in the Jacobian of the mixing function,
to relax such requirements. In this work, we introduce Diverse Influence
Component Analysis (DICA), a framework that exploits the convex geometry of the
mixing function's Jacobian. We propose a Jacobian Volume Maximization
(J-VolMax) criterion, which enables latent component identification by
encouraging diversity in their influence on the observed variables. Under
reasonable conditions, this approach achieves identifiability without relying
on auxiliary information, latent component independence, or Jacobian sparsity
assumptions. These results extend the scope of identifiability analysis and
offer a complementary perspective to existing methods.

Abstract: The use of reinforcement learning (RL) with chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning
has emerged as a promising approach for developing more capable language
models. In turn, this has led to investigation of CoT monitoring as a
compelling method for detecting harmful behaviors such as reward hacking, under
the assumption that models' reasoning processes reflect their internal
decision-making. In practice, LLM training often produces unintended behaviors
due to imperfect reward signals, leading models to develop misaligned
tendencies. A common corrective approach is to apply post-hoc instructions to
avoid problematic behaviors like sycophancy, but what happens to the model's
reasoning process when these instructions conflict with learned behaviors? We
investigate this question in simple settings and find that models engage in
systematic motivated reasoning -- generating plausible-sounding justifications
for violating their instructions while downplaying potential harms. Beyond
being an interesting property of training, we find that while motivated
reasoning can be detected by most frontier reasoning models, smaller LLM judges
can fail to identify a portion of it, and in rare cases can themselves be
persuaded that the reasoning is correct, despite it contradicting clear
instructions. This capability gap raises concerns that as models become more
sophisticated, their motivated reasoning may become increasingly difficult for
monitors to detect. Our results underscore the need to account for motivated
reasoning when relying on chain-of-thought processes for model evaluation and
oversight. All code for this paper will be made available. WARNING: some
examples in this paper may be upsetting.

Abstract: While advancements in quantization have significantly reduced the
computational costs of inference in deep learning, training still predominantly

Using simulated annealing, we optimize this approximation at different
precision levels. A C++ bit-true simulation demonstrates training of VGG-11 and
VGG-16 models on CIFAR-100 and TinyImageNet, respectively, using 12-bit integer
arithmetic with minimal accuracy degradation compared to 32-bit floating-point
training. Our hardware study reveals up to 32.5% reduction in area and 53.5%
reduction in energy consumption for the proposed LNS multiply-accumulate units
compared to that of linear fixed-point equivalents.

*Kathryn Wantlin,Chongyi Zheng,Benjamin Eysenbach*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种自监督预训练交互式智能体的方法，使其能够快速模仿人类演示，通过自动设定目标并练习达成目标来训练，在评估时通过逆强化学习解释演示行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前成功的AI模型（如VLM、LLM）缺乏明确的行动概念，而纯粹的探索性训练无法让智能体快速适应新任务。需要一种自监督的交互式训练方法，让智能体能够像生成模型那样进行自监督训练。

Method: 将目标（观察）作为基本构建块，在训练期间自动提出目标并练习达成这些目标，基于强化学习探索的先前工作。在评估时，通过解决逆强化学习问题来解释演示作为最优目标达成行为。

Result: 在标准基准测试（非专为目标达成设计）上的实验表明，该方法在零样本模仿方面优于先前的方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为交互式智能体提供了一种有效的自监督预训练框架，使其能够快速适应新任务并模仿人类演示。

Abstract: In the same way that generative models today conduct most of their training
in a self-supervised fashion, how can agentic models conduct their training in
a self-supervised fashion, interactively exploring, learning, and preparing to
quickly adapt to new tasks? A prerequisite for embodied agents deployed in real
world interactions ought to be training with interaction, yet today's most
successful AI models (e.g., VLMs, LLMs) are trained without an explicit notion
of action. The problem of pure exploration (which assumes no data as input) is
well studied in the reinforcement learning literature and provides agents with
a wide array of experiences, yet it fails to prepare them for rapid adaptation
to new tasks. Today's language and vision models are trained on data provided
by humans, which provides a strong inductive bias for the sorts of tasks that
the model will have to solve (e.g., modeling chords in a song, phrases in a
sonnet, sentences in a medical record). However, when they are prompted to
solve a new task, there is a faulty tacit assumption that humans spend most of
their time in the most rewarding states. The key contribution of our paper is a
method for pre-training interactive agents in a self-supervised fashion, so
that they can instantly mimic human demonstrations. Our method treats goals
(i.e., observations) as the atomic construct. During training, our method
automatically proposes goals and practices reaching them, building off prior
work in reinforcement learning exploration. During evaluation, our method
solves an (amortized) inverse reinforcement learning problem to explain
demonstrations as optimal goal-reaching behavior. Experiments on standard
benchmarks (not designed for goal-reaching) show that our approach outperforms
prior methods for zero-shot imitation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Gram行列式评分方法，用于在无法获取真实数据的情况下评估数据集的可靠性。该方法通过计算观测数据和实验结果的向量张成的体积来量化数据质量，具有实验无关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在无法获取真实数据的情况下，如何评估来自潜在策略性来源的数据集的可靠性是一个重要问题。真实数据不可观测，只能看到依赖于真实数据的未知统计实验结果。

Method: 提出Gram行列式评分方法，通过计算描述观测数据经验分布和实验结果的向量所张成的体积来度量可靠性。该方法具有实验无关性，即无论使用何种实验，都能产生相同的数据集可靠性排序。

Result: 在合成噪声模型、CIFAR-10嵌入和真实就业数据上的实验表明，Gram行列式评分能够有效捕捉不同观测过程中的数据质量。

Conclusion: Gram行列式评分是一种有效的可靠性评估方法，能够在无法获取真实数据的情况下，通过实验无关的方式准确评估数据集的可靠性。

Abstract: How can we assess the reliability of a dataset without access to ground
truth? We introduce the problem of reliability scoring for datasets collected
from potentially strategic sources. The true data are unobserved, but we see
outcomes of an unknown statistical experiment that depends on them. To
benchmark reliability, we define ground-truth-based orderings that capture how
much reported data deviate from the truth. We then propose the Gram determinant
score, which measures the volume spanned by vectors describing the empirical
distribution of the observed data and experiment outcomes. We show that this
score preserves several ground-truth based reliability orderings and, uniquely
up to scaling, yields the same reliability ranking of datasets regardless of
the experiment -- a property we term experiment agnosticism. Experiments on
synthetic noise models, CIFAR-10 embeddings, and real employment data
demonstrate that the Gram determinant score effectively captures data quality
across diverse observation processes.

*Zan Li,Rui Fan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种自适应图学习框架，通过专业专家网络实现金融异常检测的内置可解释性，能够识别四种特定异常机制并追踪其时间演化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有异常检测器将所有异常统一处理，无法揭示具体失效机制、风险集中位置或干预措施，这种不透明性阻碍了针对性监管响应。存在三个未解决挑战：静态图结构无法适应市场相关性变化；统一检测机制无法捕捉多时间尺度的类型特定特征；黑盒输出无法提供异常机制及其时间演化的可操作指导。

Method: 通过BiLSTM与自注意力捕捉多尺度时间依赖，通过跨模态注意力融合时空信息，通过神经多源插值学习动态图，通过应力调制融合自适应平衡学习动态与结构先验，将异常路由到四个机制特定专家，并产生双级可解释归因。可解释性在架构层面内置而非事后应用。

Result: 在100只美国股票（2017-2024）上，实现了92.3%的13个主要事件检测率，领先时间3.8天，比最佳基线提高30.8个百分点。硅谷银行案例研究展示了异常演化追踪：价格冲击专家权重在关闭期间升至0.39（比基线0.29高33%），一周后达到峰值0.48（比基线高66%），无需标记监督即可自动识别时间机制。

Conclusion: 该框架通过自适应图学习和专业专家网络解决了金融异常检测的关键挑战，提供了机制特定的可解释检测，能够适应市场动态并追踪异常演化，为针对性监管干预提供了可行指导。

Abstract: Financial anomalies exhibit heterogeneous mechanisms (price shocks, liquidity
freezes, contagion cascades, regime shifts), but existing detectors treat all
anomalies uniformly, producing scalar scores without revealing which mechanism
is failing, where risks concentrate, or how to intervene. This opacity prevents
targeted regulatory responses. Three unsolved challenges persist: (1) static
graph structures cannot adapt when market correlations shift during regime
changes; (2) uniform detection mechanisms miss type-specific signatures across
multiple temporal scales while failing to integrate individual behaviors with
network contagion; (3) black-box outputs provide no actionable guidance on
anomaly mechanisms or their temporal evolution.
  We address these via adaptive graph learning with specialized expert networks
that provide built-in interpretability. Our framework captures multi-scale
temporal dependencies through BiLSTM with self-attention, fuses temporal and
spatial information via cross-modal attention, learns dynamic graphs through
neural multi-source interpolation, adaptively balances learned dynamics with
structural priors via stress-modulated fusion, routes anomalies to four
mechanism-specific experts, and produces dual-level interpretable attributions.
Critically, interpretability is embedded architecturally rather than applied
post-hoc.
  On 100 US equities (2017-2024), we achieve 92.3% detection of 13 major events
with 3.8-day lead time, outperforming best baseline by 30.8pp. Silicon Valley
Bank case study demonstrates anomaly evolution tracking: Price-Shock expert
weight rose to 0.39 (33% above baseline 0.29) during closure, peaking at 0.48
(66% above baseline) one week later, revealing automatic temporal mechanism
identification without labeled supervision.

*Zhiyuan Fan,Arnab Maiti,Kevin Jamieson,Lillian J. Ratliff,Gabriele Farina*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了Hedge算法在组合设置中的最优性，证明了Hedge在大多数组合设置中接近最优（最多相差√log d因子），但在某些特定设置（如m-集合）中确实存在√log d的次优性差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究Hedge算法在组合在线学习设置中的最优性，确定其在各种组合问题（如扩展形式博弈、资源分配、m-集合等）中的性能界限。

Method: 通过建立下界分析证明Hedge的最优性，识别特定组合类别（m-集合）展示其次优性，并利用Hedge的接近最优性为DAG中的在线最短路径问题构建最优正则化器。

Result: 证明了对于任意X⊆{0,1}^d，Hedge是接近最优的（最多相差√log d因子），但在m-集合（log d≤m≤√d）中Hedge确实存在√log d的次优性差距。同时证明了Hedge在在线多任务学习中是最优的。

Conclusion: Hedge算法在大多数组合设置中接近最优，但在某些特定组合结构中存在可证明的次优性差距。利用Hedge的接近最优性可以为更广泛的组合问题（如DAG最短路径）构建最优算法。

Abstract: In this paper, we study the classical Hedge algorithm in combinatorial
settings. In each round, the learner selects a vector $\boldsymbol{x}_t$ from a
set $X \subseteq \{0,1\}^d$, observes a full loss vector $\boldsymbol{y}_t \in
\mathbb{R}^d$, and incurs a loss $\langle \boldsymbol{x}_t, \boldsymbol{y}_t
\rangle \in [-1,1]$. This setting captures several important problems,
including extensive-form games, resource allocation, $m$-sets, online multitask
learning, and shortest-path problems on directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). It is
well known that Hedge achieves a regret of $O\big(\sqrt{T \log |X|}\big)$ after
$T$ rounds of interaction. In this paper, we ask whether Hedge is optimal
across all combinatorial settings. To that end, we show that for any $X
\subseteq \{0,1\}^d$, Hedge is near-optimal--specifically, up to a $\sqrt{\log
d}$ factor--by establishing a lower bound of $\Omega\big(\sqrt{T \log(|X|)/\log
d}\big)$ that holds for any algorithm. We then identify a natural class of
combinatorial sets--namely, $m$-sets with $\log d \leq m \leq \sqrt{d}$--for
which this lower bound is tight, and for which Hedge is provably suboptimal by
a factor of exactly $\sqrt{\log d}$. At the same time, we show that Hedge is
optimal for online multitask learning, a generalization of the classical
$K$-experts problem. Finally, we leverage the near-optimality of Hedge to
establish the existence of a near-optimal regularizer for online shortest-path
problems in DAGs--a setting that subsumes a broad range of combinatorial
domains. Specifically, we show that the classical Online Mirror Descent (OMD)
algorithm, when instantiated with the dilated entropy regularizer, is
iterate-equivalent to Hedge, and therefore inherits its near-optimal regret
guarantees for DAGs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了首个在聚合bandit反馈下的episodic MDPs中的最佳两世界(BOBW)算法，在已知转移时实现了O(log T)随机遗憾和O(√T)对抗遗憾，并建立了匹配的下界证明最优性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究仅关注最坏情况分析，本文首次研究在聚合bandit反馈下同时适应随机和对抗环境的BOBW算法，填补了该领域空白。

Method: 结合了基于占用度量的FTRL、自边界技术和受在线最短路径问题启发的损失估计器，并扩展到未知转移情况。

Result: 在已知转移情况下实现了最优遗憾界，在未知转移情况下通过置信度技术扩展了方法，同时为最短路径问题提供了首个个体间隙相关下界。

Conclusion: 成功设计了首个在聚合bandit反馈下具有最优性能的BOBW算法，为episodic MDPs和最短路径问题提供了理论保证。

Abstract: We study online learning in finite-horizon episodic Markov decision processes
(MDPs) under the challenging aggregate bandit feedback model, where the learner
observes only the cumulative loss incurred in each episode, rather than
individual losses at each state-action pair. While prior work in this setting
has focused exclusively on worst-case analysis, we initiate the study of
best-of-both-worlds (BOBW) algorithms that achieve low regret in both
stochastic and adversarial environments. We propose the first BOBW algorithms
for episodic tabular MDPs with aggregate bandit feedback. In the case of known
transitions, our algorithms achieve $O(\log T)$ regret in stochastic settings
and ${O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret in adversarial ones. Importantly, we also establish
matching lower bounds, showing the optimality of our algorithms in this
setting. We further extend our approach to unknown-transition settings by
incorporating confidence-based techniques. Our results rely on a combination of
FTRL over occupancy measures, self-bounding techniques, and new loss estimators
inspired by recent advances in online shortest path problems. Along the way, we
also provide the first individual-gap-dependent lower bounds and demonstrate
near-optimal BOBW algorithms for shortest path problems with bandit feedback.

TL;DR: 本文揭示了Transformer编码器与图卷积网络(GCN)的基本等价性，提出Fighter架构简化冗余线性投影并引入多跳图聚合，在保持竞争力的同时提供更清晰的机制可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer在时间序列建模中表现出色，但其内部机制仍然不透明，需要揭示其工作原理以提高可解释性。

Method: 建立Transformer编码器与GCN的等价性，将注意力分布矩阵视为动态邻接矩阵，提出Fighter架构去除冗余线性投影并加入多跳图聚合。

Result: 在标准预测基准测试中，Fighter实现了有竞争力的性能，同时提供了对其预测的更清晰机制可解释性。

Conclusion: Transformer编码器本质上等价于GCN，这种统一的理论重构为时间序列建模提供了显式和可解释的依赖关系表示。

Abstract: Transformers have achieved remarkable success in time series modeling, yet
their internal mechanisms remain opaque. This work demystifies the Transformer
encoder by establishing its fundamental equivalence to a Graph Convolutional
Network (GCN). We show that in the forward pass, the attention distribution
matrix serves as a dynamic adjacency matrix, and its composition with
subsequent transformations performs computations analogous to graph
convolution. Moreover, we demonstrate that in the backward pass, the update
dynamics of value and feed-forward projections mirror those of GCN parameters.
Building on this unified theoretical reinterpretation, we propose
\textbf{Fighter} (Flexible Graph Convolutional Transformer), a streamlined
architecture that removes redundant linear projections and incorporates
multi-hop graph aggregation. This perspective yields an explicit and
interpretable representation of temporal dependencies across different scales,
naturally expressed as graph edges. Experiments on standard forecasting
benchmarks confirm that Fighter achieves competitive performance while
providing clearer mechanistic interpretability of its predictions.

TL;DR: 提出基于矩阵自由能的自动编码器正则化方案，通过奇异值分布约束使编码矩阵接近高斯分布，提高泛化能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自动编码器缺乏对编码分布的有效约束，需要一种能产生高斯分布编码的正则化方法

Method: 定义基于编码矩阵奇异值的可微损失函数，通过最小化矩阵自由能使编码分布接近独立同分布高斯随机矩阵

Result: 经验模拟显示该方法能产生高斯化编码，在训练和测试集上均表现良好泛化能力

Conclusion: 矩阵自由能正则化能有效约束编码分布，适用于欠定逆问题等应用场景

Abstract: We introduce a novel regularization scheme for autoencoders based on
matricial free energy. Our approach defines a differentiable loss function in
terms of the singular values of the code matrix (code dimension x batch size).
From the standpoint of free probability an d random matrix theory, this loss
achieves its minimum when the singular value distribution of the code matrix
coincides with that of an appropriately sculpted random metric with i.i.d.
Gaussian entries. Empirical simulations demonstrate that minimizing the
negative matricial free energy through standard stochastic gradient-based
training yields Gaussian-like codes that generalize across training and test
sets. Building on this foundation, we propose a matricidal free energy
maximizing autoencoder that reliably produces Gaussian codes and show its
application to underdetermined inverse problems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习方法大多基于离散时间，而实际控制问题本质上是连续时间的。需要开发能在连续时间框架下保持Q函数动作评估能力的方法。

Method: 通过鞅条件定义连续时间Q函数，利用动态规划原理将扩散策略分数与学习到的连续Q函数的动作梯度关联，提出连续Q分数匹配(CQSM)算法。

Result: 在线性二次控制问题上提供了理论闭式解，在模拟环境中验证了方法的有效性，并与主流基线方法进行了比较。

Conclusion: CQSM方法成功解决了连续时间强化学习中长期存在的挑战，即在不依赖时间离散化的情况下保持Q函数的动作评估能力。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved significant success across a wide
range of domains, however, most existing methods are formulated in discrete
time. In this work, we introduce a novel RL method for continuous-time control,
where stochastic differential equations govern state-action dynamics. Departing
from traditional value function-based approaches, our key contribution is the
characterization of continuous-time Q-functions via a martingale condition and
the linking of diffusion policy scores to the action gradient of a learned
continuous Q-function by the dynamic programming principle. This insight
motivates Continuous Q-Score Matching (CQSM), a score-based policy improvement
algorithm. Notably, our method addresses a long-standing challenge in
continuous-time RL: preserving the action-evaluation capability of Q-functions
without relying on time discretization. We further provide theoretical
closed-form solutions for linear-quadratic (LQ) control problems within our
framework. Numerical results in simulated environments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed method and compare it to popular baselines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个评估LLM在对话中发现和利用用户潜在信息的统一基准，包含三个逐步现实的任务设置，揭示了LLM在个性化交互中有效推理偏好的能力仍有待提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在需要用户特定偏好的场景中表现有限，因为用户很少明确表达所有偏好，大量信息是潜在的，需要通过对话来推断。

Method: 引入统一基准评估潜在信息发现能力，采用三智能体框架（用户、助手、评判者），包含20 Questions游戏、个性化问答和个性化文本摘要三个任务。

Result: LLM确实可以通过对话发现潜在信息，但成功率差异很大（32%-98%），取决于任务复杂性、主题和隐藏属性数量。

Conclusion: 该基准为研究个性化交互中的潜在信息发现提供了首个系统框架，表明有效的偏好推理仍然是构建真正自适应AI系统的开放前沿。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at producing broadly relevant text, but
this generality becomes a limitation when user-specific preferences are
required, such as recommending restaurants or planning travel. In these
scenarios, users rarely articulate every preference explicitly; instead, much
of what they care about remains latent, waiting to be inferred. This raises a
fundamental question: Can LLMs uncover and reason about such latent information
through conversation?
  We address this problem by introducing a unified benchmark for evaluating
latent information discovery - the ability of LLMs to reveal and utilize hidden
user attributes through multi-turn interaction. The benchmark spans three
progressively realistic settings: the classic 20 Questions game, Personalized
Question Answering, and Personalized Text Summarization. All tasks share a
tri-agent framework (User, Assistant, Judge) enabling turn-level evaluation of
elicitation and adaptation. Our results reveal that while LLMs can indeed
surface latent information through dialogue, their success varies dramatically
with context: from 32% to 98%, depending on task complexity, topic, and number
of hidden attributes. This benchmark provides the first systematic framework
for studying latent information discovery in personalized interaction,
highlighting that effective preference inference remains an open frontier for
building truly adaptive AI systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决分类器自由引导(CFG)方法在提高图像质量和提示对齐时导致多样性降低的问题，同时避免现有解耦方法需要额外训练辅助模型的开销。

Method: 在推理时使用随机前向传递动态生成劣质预测，将引导重新定义为推理时的自校正过程，无需任何辅助组件。

Result: 该方法不仅可行，而且为成本高效的引导建立了强大的新基准，证明无需外部模型即可实现自引导的益处。

Conclusion: In-situ Autoguidance是一种零成本的自引导方法，成功实现了无需辅助模型的图像生成质量与多样性的解耦。

Abstract: The generation of high-quality, diverse, and prompt-aligned images is a
central goal in image-generating diffusion models. The popular classifier-free
guidance (CFG) approach improves quality and alignment at the cost of reduced
variation, creating an inherent entanglement of these effects. Recent work has
successfully disentangled these properties by guiding a model with a separately
trained, inferior counterpart; however, this solution introduces the
considerable overhead of requiring an auxiliary model. We challenge this
prerequisite by introducing In-situ Autoguidance, a method that elicits
guidance from the model itself without any auxiliary components. Our approach
dynamically generates an inferior prediction on the fly using a stochastic
forward pass, reframing guidance as a form of inference-time self-correction.
We demonstrate that this zero-cost approach is not only viable but also
establishes a powerful new baseline for cost-efficient guidance, proving that
the benefits of self-guidance can be achieved without external models.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统监督学习在部署后模型固定，不适用于动态开放环境。需要模型能够检测新类别样本并持续学习。

Result: 经验评估将证明PLDA的有效性。

Conclusion: ALMD范式为动态环境中的持续学习提供了可行解决方案，PLDA方法能够有效应对相关挑战。

Abstract: In classic supervised learning, once a model is deployed in an application,
it is fixed. No updates will be made to it during the application. This is
inappropriate for many dynamic and open environments, where unexpected samples
from unseen classes may appear. In such an environment, the model should be
able to detect these novel samples from unseen classes and learn them after
they are labeled. We call this paradigm Autonomous Learning after Model
Deployment (ALMD). The learning here is continuous and involves no human
engineers. Labeling in this scenario is performed by human co-workers or other
knowledgeable agents, which is similar to what humans do when they encounter an
unfamiliar object and ask another person for its name. In ALMD, the detection
of novel samples is dynamic and differs from traditional out-of-distribution
(OOD) detection in that the set of in-distribution (ID) classes expands as new
classes are learned during application, whereas ID classes is fixed in
traditional OOD detection. Learning is also different from classic supervised
learning because in ALMD, we learn the encountered new classes immediately and
incrementally. It is difficult to retrain the model from scratch using all the
past data from the ID classes and the novel samples from newly discovered
classes, as this would be resource- and time-consuming. Apart from these two
challenges, ALMD faces the data scarcity issue because instances of new classes
often appear sporadically in real-life applications. To address these issues,
we propose a novel method, PLDA, which performs dynamic OOD detection and
incremental learning of new classes on the fly. Empirical evaluations will
demonstrate the effectiveness of PLDA.

TL;DR: ALPINE是一个轻量级自适应框架，让终端设备能够实时调整差分隐私级别，在移动边缘众感知系统中平衡隐私保护、数据效用和能耗成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 移动边缘众感知系统在动态资源受限环境中持续传输用户数据，面临严重隐私威胁。静态差分隐私机制无法适应不断变化的风险（如攻击能力变化、资源约束和任务需求变化），导致要么噪声过大要么保护不足。

Method: ALPINE作为闭环控制系统，包含四个模块：动态风险感知、基于TD3算法的隐私决策、本地隐私执行和边缘节点性能验证。设计了平衡隐私收益、数据效用和能耗成本的奖励函数，指导TD3智能体自适应调整噪声幅度。

Result: 广泛的理论分析和真实世界模拟表明，ALPINE能有效减轻推理攻击，同时保持效用和成本，适用于大规模边缘应用。协作风险模型和预训练的TD3智能体设计为低开销部署。

Conclusion: ALPINE框架能够在不同风险场景下实现隐私、效用和成本之间的动态平衡，为大规模边缘应用提供了实用的隐私保护解决方案。

Abstract: Mobile edge crowdsensing (MECS) systems continuously generate and transmit
user data in dynamic, resource-constrained environments, exposing users to
significant privacy threats. In practice, many privacy-preserving mechanisms
build on differential privacy (DP). However, static DP mechanisms often fail to
adapt to evolving risks, for example, shifts in adversarial capabilities,
resource constraints and task requirements, resulting in either excessive noise
or inadequate protection. To address this challenge, we propose ALPINE, a
lightweight, adaptive framework that empowers terminal devices to autonomously
adjust differential privacy levels in real time. ALPINE operates as a
closed-loop control system consisting of four modules: dynamic risk perception,
privacy decision via twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3),
local privacy execution and performance verification from edge nodes. Based on
environmental risk assessments, we design a reward function that balances
privacy gains, data utility and energy cost, guiding the TD3 agent to
adaptively tune noise magnitude across diverse risk scenarios and achieve a
dynamic equilibrium among privacy, utility and cost. Both the collaborative
risk model and pretrained TD3-based agent are designed for low-overhead
deployment. Extensive theoretical analysis and real-world simulations
demonstrate that ALPINE effectively mitigates inference attacks while
preserving utility and cost, making it practical for large-scale edge
applications.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个统一的框架来评估文本属性图(TAG)学习中图神经网络(GNN)和大语言模型(LLM)的鲁棒性，揭示了模型在文本和结构扰动下的固有权衡，并提出了SFT-auto框架来提升对抗性环境中的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对文本属性图学习中GNN和LLM鲁棒性的评估是碎片化的，缺乏对文本和结构扰动的系统性研究。需要建立一个统一的评估框架来全面理解模型在不同攻击场景下的表现。

Method: 提出了一个统一的鲁棒性评估框架，在10个数据集上评估经典GNN、鲁棒GNN和GraphLLM在文本、结构和混合扰动下的表现，包括投毒和规避攻击场景。

Result: 研究发现：1)模型在文本和结构鲁棒性之间存在固有权衡；2)GNN和RGNN的性能高度依赖文本编码器和攻击类型；3)GraphLLM对训练数据污染特别脆弱。

Conclusion: 该工作为TAG安全研究奠定了基础，提出的SFT-auto框架能够在单一模型中实现对文本和结构攻击的平衡鲁棒性，为对抗性环境中的TAG学习提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) are
powerful approaches for learning on Text-Attributed Graphs (TAGs), a
comprehensive understanding of their robustness remains elusive. Current
evaluations are fragmented, failing to systematically investigate the distinct
effects of textual and structural perturbations across diverse models and
attack scenarios. To address these limitations, we introduce a unified and
comprehensive framework to evaluate robustness in TAG learning. Our framework
evaluates classical GNNs, robust GNNs (RGNNs), and GraphLLMs across ten
datasets from four domains, under diverse text-based, structure-based, and
hybrid perturbations in both poisoning and evasion scenarios. Our extensive
analysis reveals multiple findings, among which three are particularly
noteworthy: 1) models have inherent robustness trade-offs between text and
structure, 2) the performance of GNNs and RGNNs depends heavily on the text
encoder and attack type, and 3) GraphLLMs are particularly vulnerable to
training data corruption. To overcome the identified trade-offs, we introduce

TL;DR: 提出了一个模块化的分子动力学方法基准测试框架，使用增强采样分析来系统评估蛋白质MD方法，支持多种模拟引擎和评估指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分子动力学方法的快速发展超过了标准化验证工具的开发，不同模拟方法之间的客观比较受到评估指标不一致、稀有构象状态采样不足和可重复基准缺失的阻碍。

Result: 贡献了包含9种不同蛋白质的数据集（10-224个残基），每个蛋白质在300K下进行了100万MD步骤的广泛模拟。验证测试显示框架能够有效比较经典MD模拟和不同训练状态的机器学习模型。

Conclusion: 通过标准化评估协议和实现直接、可重复的MD方法比较，这个开源平台为分子模拟社区的一致、严格基准测试奠定了基础。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of molecular dynamics (MD) methods, including
machine-learned dynamics, has outpaced the development of standardized tools
for method validation. Objective comparison between simulation approaches is
often hindered by inconsistent evaluation metrics, insufficient sampling of
rare conformational states, and the absence of reproducible benchmarks. To
address these challenges, we introduce a modular benchmarking framework that
systematically evaluates protein MD methods using enhanced sampling analysis.
Our approach uses weighted ensemble (WE) sampling via The Weighted Ensemble
Simulation Toolkit with Parallelization and Analysis (WESTPA), based on
progress coordinates derived from Time-lagged Independent Component Analysis
(TICA), enabling fast and efficient exploration of protein conformational
space. The framework includes a flexible, lightweight propagator interface that
supports arbitrary simulation engines, allowing both classical force fields and
machine learning-based models. Additionally, the framework offers a
comprehensive evaluation suite capable of computing more than 19 different
metrics and visualizations across a variety of domains. We further contribute a
dataset of nine diverse proteins, ranging from 10 to 224 residues, that span a
variety of folding complexities and topologies. Each protein has been
extensively simulated at 300K for one million MD steps per starting point (4
ns). To demonstrate the utility of our framework, we perform validation tests
using classic MD simulations with implicit solvent and compare protein
conformational sampling using a fully trained versus under-trained CGSchNet
model. By standardizing evaluation protocols and enabling direct, reproducible
comparisons across MD approaches, our open-source platform lays the groundwork
for consistent, rigorous benchmarking across the molecular simulation
community.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SOLE是一个软硬件协同设计，通过E2Softmax和AILayerNorm分别优化Softmax和LayerNorm的计算效率，在不重新训练的情况下实现显著的速度提升和能耗降低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer模型在NLP和CV任务中表现出色，但其实时推理速度和效率受到Softmax和LayerNorm计算效率低下的限制。现有基于函数逼近的方法存在内存开销大且需要重新训练的问题。

Method: 提出SOLE软硬件协同设计：E2Softmax使用指数函数的log2量化和基于对数的除法来逼近Softmax；AILayerNorm采用低精度统计计算。两者都实现了低精度计算和低比特位宽存储。

Result: 实验表明SOLE在保持推理精度的同时，相比GPU实现了数量级的速度提升和能耗节省。与现有最佳定制硬件相比，Softmax和LayerNorm分别实现了3.04倍和3.86倍的能效提升，以及2.82倍和3.32倍的面积效率提升。

Conclusion: SOLE提供了一种无需重新训练的高效Softmax和LayerNorm优化方案，显著提升了Transformer模型的推理效率和能效表现。

Abstract: Transformers have shown remarkable performance in both natural language
processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV) tasks. However, their real-time
inference speed and efficiency are limited due to the inefficiency in Softmax
and Layer Normalization (LayerNorm). Previous works based on function
approximation suffer from inefficient implementation as they place emphasis on
computation while disregarding memory overhead concerns. Moreover, such methods
rely on retraining to compensate for approximation error which can be costly
and inconvenient.
  In this paper, we present SOLE, a hardware-software co-design for Softmax and
LayerNorm which is composed of E2Softmax and AILayerNorm. E2Softmax utilizes
log2 quantization of exponent function and log-based division to approximate
Softmax while AILayerNorm adopts low-precision statistic calculation. Compared
with state-of-the-art designs, we achieve both low-precision calculation and
low bit-width storage on Softmax and LayerNorm. Experiments show that SOLE
maintains inference accuracy without retraining while offering orders of
magnitude speedup and energy savings over GPU, achieving 3.04x, 3.86x
energy-efficiency improvements and 2.82x, 3.32x area-efficiency improvements
over prior state-of-the-art custom hardware for Softmax and LayerNorm,
respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统掩码扩散模型在解码时面临二元选择问题，当保留掩码时会丢弃有价值的预测信息，限制了模型性能

Method: 引入软掩码方法，动态混合掩码标记嵌入与前一解码步骤预测的前k个标记嵌入，为模型提供更丰富的先验信息

Result: 在169M参数模型上继续预训练改善了困惑度和MAUVE分数；在Dream-7B和Dream-Coder-7B模型上微调后，在多个编码基准测试中性能一致提升，特别是在高吞吐量设置下

Conclusion: 软掩码方法有效解决了掩码扩散模型的局限性，通过保留部分预测信息提升了模型性能，在语言建模和代码生成任务中表现出色

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated strong potential in language modeling,
offering various advantages over traditional autoregressive approaches. Their
ability to generate and revise entire responses in parallel enables faster
generation and built-in self-correction mechanisms. Most modern diffusion-based
language models employ masked diffusion, where decoding involves iteratively
processing masked tokens based on a binary decision: either retaining the mask
or replacing it with the predicted token. However, this binary choice discards
valuable predictive information when the mask is retained. To address this
limitation, we introduce soft-masking (SM), a novel method that dynamically
blends the embedding of the mask token with the embeddings of the top-$k$
predicted tokens from the previous decoding step, for each retained mask. This
provides the model with a more informative prior, preserving context from
earlier computations and allowing partial information about masked tokens to
propagate beyond a single step. We propose a training methodology that adapts a
pretrained masked diffusion language model to incorporate SM. We demonstrate
that continuing pretraining a 169M parameter model with SM leads to improved
perplexity and MAUVE scores. Furthermore, we finetune two state-of-the-art
diffusion models, Dream-7B and Dream-Coder-7B, with SM. SM consistently
improves performance across multiple coding benchmarks, particularly in
high-throughput settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种针对高风险高回报任务的强化学习框架，通过离散化动作空间、熵正则化探索和双评论家架构来解决多模态动作分布和随机回报问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习方法假设单峰高斯策略和标量评论家，在高风险高回报任务中效果有限，因为这类任务通常具有多模态动作分布和随机回报特性。

Method: 1) 离散化连续动作空间以近似多模态分布；2) 使用熵正则化探索提高对高风险高回报动作的覆盖；3) 引入双评论家架构进行更准确的离散值分布估计。

Result: 在具有高失败风险的移动和操作基准测试中，该方法优于基线方法，证明了显式建模多模态性和风险的重要性。

Conclusion: 该框架能够扩展到高维动作空间，支持复杂控制领域，为高风险高回报任务提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Tasks involving high-risk-high-return (HRHR) actions, such as obstacle
crossing, often exhibit multimodal action distributions and stochastic returns.
Most reinforcement learning (RL) methods assume unimodal Gaussian policies and
rely on scalar-valued critics, which limits their effectiveness in HRHR
settings. We formally define HRHR tasks and theoretically show that Gaussian
policies cannot guarantee convergence to the optimal solution. To address this,
we propose a reinforcement learning framework that (i) discretizes continuous
action spaces to approximate multimodal distributions, (ii) employs
entropy-regularized exploration to improve coverage of risky but rewarding
actions, and (iii) introduces a dual-critic architecture for more accurate
discrete value distribution estimation. The framework scales to
high-dimensional action spaces, supporting complex control domains. Experiments
on locomotion and manipulation benchmarks with high risks of failure
demonstrate that our method outperforms baselines, underscoring the importance
of explicitly modeling multimodality and risk in RL.

Motivation: 传统生物识别技术存在隐私问题，大多数研究未解决驾驶员识别中的数据短缺问题，且对未知驾驶员识别不灵活。

Method: 使用注意力机制的编码器(AttEnc)减少模型参数；结合原型网络和注意力编码器(P-AttEnc)应用小样本学习解决数据短缺。

Result: AttEnc在三个数据集上分别达到99.3%、99.0%和99.9%的准确率，预测时间快44%-79%，平均减少87.6%参数；P-AttEnc在单样本场景下识别准确率69.8%，对未知驾驶员分类平均准确率65.7%。

Conclusion: 提出的AttEnc和P-AttEnc架构在驾驶员识别中表现出色，能有效解决数据短缺问题，提高模型泛化能力，并保护用户隐私。

Abstract: Driver identification has become an area of increasing interest in recent
years, especially for data- driven applications, because biometric-based
technologies may incur privacy issues. This study proposes a deep learning
neural network architecture, an attention-based encoder (AttEnc), which uses an
attention mechanism for driver identification and uses fewer model parameters
than current methods. Most studies do not address the issue of data shortages
for driver identification, and most of them are inflexible when encountering
unknown drivers. In this study, an architecture that combines a prototypical
network and an attention-based encoder (P-AttEnc) is proposed. It applies
few-shot learning to overcome the data shortage issues and to enhance model
generalizations. The experiments showed that the attention-based encoder can
identify drivers with accuracies of 99.3%, 99.0% and 99.9% in three different
datasets and has a prediction time that is 44% to 79% faster because it
significantly reduces, on average, 87.6% of the model parameters. P-AttEnc
identifies drivers based on few shot data, extracts driver fingerprints to
address the issue of data shortages, and is able to classify unknown drivers.
The first experiment showed that P-AttEnc can identify drivers with an accuracy
of 69.8% in the one-shot scenario. The second experiment showed that P-AttEnc,
in the 1-shot scenario, can classify unknown drivers with an average accuracy
of 65.7%.

Motivation: 现有的一致性模型依赖手动设计的离散化方案，这在不同噪声调度和数据集上需要重复调整，限制了模型的效率和适应性。

Method: 将离散化步骤制定为优化问题，使用局部一致性作为优化目标确保可训练性，全局一致性作为约束控制训练目标中的去噪误差，通过拉格朗日乘子平衡两者，并采用高斯-牛顿方法实现自适应离散化。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和ImageNet上，ADCMs显著提高了训练效率，以最小的训练开销实现了优越的生成性能，并对更先进的扩散模型变体表现出强适应性。

Conclusion: ADCMs框架为一致性模型提供了自动自适应的离散化方法，有效解决了手动离散化方案的局限性，在多个数据集上验证了其高效性和优越性能。

Abstract: Consistency Models (CMs) have shown promise for efficient one-step
generation. However, most existing CMs rely on manually designed discretization
schemes, which can cause repeated adjustments for different noise schedules and
datasets. To address this, we propose a unified framework for the automatic and
adaptive discretization of CMs, formulating it as an optimization problem with
respect to the discretization step. Concretely, during the consistency training
process, we propose using local consistency as the optimization objective to
ensure trainability by avoiding excessive discretization, and taking global
consistency as a constraint to ensure stability by controlling the denoising
error in the training target. We establish the trade-off between local and
global consistency with a Lagrange multiplier. Building on this framework, we
achieve adaptive discretization for CMs using the Gauss-Newton method. We refer
to our approach as ADCMs. Experiments demonstrate that ADCMs significantly
improve the training efficiency of CMs, achieving superior generative
performance with minimal training overhead on both CIFAR-10 and ImageNet.
Moreover, ADCMs exhibit strong adaptability to more advanced DM variants. Code

Motivation: 数据同化涉及将动态模型与噪声和不完整观测相结合来推断系统状态，大多数设置中都存在不确定性。现有确定性方法无法充分处理这种不确定性。

Method: 基于变分推断，将预测状态建模为多变量高斯分布，使用混沌Lorenz-96动力学作为测试平台，并集成到更广泛的变分数据同化流程中。

Conclusion: 提出的变分推断扩展方法在数据同化中有效处理不确定性，提供校准良好的预测，并展示了在更长时间窗口中的优势。

Abstract: Data assimilation, consisting in the combination of a dynamical model with a
set of noisy and incomplete observations in order to infer the state of a
system over time, involves uncertainty in most settings. Building upon an
existing deterministic machine learning approach, we propose a variational
inference-based extension in which the predicted state follows a multivariate
Gaussian distribution. Using the chaotic Lorenz-96 dynamics as a testing
ground, we show that our new model enables to obtain nearly perfectly
calibrated predictions, and can be integrated in a wider variational data
assimilation pipeline in order to achieve greater benefit from increasing
lengths of data assimilation windows. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 论文提出ControlValve防御机制，通过生成允许的控制流图并在执行时强制执行，解决多智能体系统中的控制流劫持攻击问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于对齐检查的防御机制（如LlamaFirewall）无法有效防御控制流劫持攻击，因为安全性和功能性目标存在根本冲突，且对齐定义脆弱、检查器对执行上下文可见性不完整。

Method: 提出ControlValve防御机制，包括：(1) 为多智能体系统生成允许的控制流图；(2) 强制执行所有执行符合这些控制流图，并为每个智能体调用生成零样本上下文规则。

Result: ControlValve能够有效防御控制流劫持攻击，即使攻击者能够规避基于对齐检查的防御。

Conclusion: ControlValve基于控制流完整性和最小权限原则，为多智能体系统提供了更强大的安全保障，解决了现有防御机制的局限性。

Abstract: Control-flow hijacking attacks manipulate orchestration mechanisms in
multi-agent systems into performing unsafe actions that compromise the system
and exfiltrate sensitive information. Recently proposed defenses, such as
LlamaFirewall, rely on alignment checks of inter-agent communications to ensure
that all agent invocations are "related to" and "likely to further" the
original objective.
  We start by demonstrating control-flow hijacking attacks that evade these
defenses even if alignment checks are performed by advanced LLMs. We argue that
the safety and functionality objectives of multi-agent systems fundamentally
conflict with each other. This conflict is exacerbated by the brittle
definitions of "alignment" and the checkers' incomplete visibility into the
execution context.
  We then propose, implement, and evaluate ControlValve, a new defense inspired
by the principles of control-flow integrity and least privilege. ControlValve
(1) generates permitted control-flow graphs for multi-agent systems, and (2)
enforces that all executions comply with these graphs, along with contextual
rules (generated in a zero-shot manner) for each agent invocation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于高质量数据逐渐耗尽和计算资源边际收益递减，传统通过扩大数据、参数和测试时计算的方法已接近上限，需要借鉴人类和传统AI系统从实践中学习的能力，构建LLM系统的记忆和持续学习框架。

Method: 设计用户反馈模拟框架和综合基准测试，涵盖多个领域、语言和任务类型，用于评估LLM系统的持续学习能力。

Result: 实验表明，现有最先进基准方法的有效性和效率远未达到满意水平。

Conclusion: 该基准测试为未来LLM记忆和优化算法的研究铺平了道路。

Abstract: Scaling up data, parameters, and test-time computation has been the
mainstream methods to improve LLM systems (LLMsys), but their upper bounds are
almost reached due to the gradual depletion of high-quality data and marginal
gains obtained from larger computational resource consumption. Inspired by the
abilities of human and traditional AI systems in learning from practice,
constructing memory and continual learning frameworks for LLMsys has become an
important and popular research direction in recent literature. Yet, existing
benchmarks for LLM memory often focus on evaluating the system on homogeneous
reading comprehension tasks with long-form inputs rather than testing their
abilities to learn from accumulated user feedback in service time. Therefore,
we propose a user feedback simulation framework and a comprehensive benchmark
covering multiple domains, languages, and types of tasks to evaluate the
continual learning abilities of LLMsys. Experiments show that the effectiveness
and efficiency of state-of-the-art baselines are far from satisfying, and we
hope this benchmark could pave the way for future studies on LLM memory and
optimization algorithms.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有理论主要关注紧致群对称性且假设数据分布本身不变，这在现实应用中很少满足。作者希望将泛化保证扩展到更广泛的非紧致对称性和非不变数据分布场景。

Method: 基于PAC-Bayes框架，作者改进并收紧现有边界，特别是McAllester的PAC-Bayes边界，并证明该方法适用于多种PAC-Bayes边界。在非均匀旋转的MNIST数据集上进行实验验证。

Result: 在非均匀旋转的MNIST数据集上，推导出的泛化保证不仅成立，而且优于先前结果。这为对称模型在对称数据上的优越性提供了理论证据。

Conclusion: 对于对称数据，对称模型在超越紧致群和不变分布局限的更广泛场景中具有优势，这为理解机器学习中对称性开辟了更一般的途径。

Abstract: Symmetries are known to improve the empirical performance of machine learning
models, yet theoretical guarantees explaining these gains remain limited. Prior
work has focused mainly on compact group symmetries and often assumes that the
data distribution itself is invariant, an assumption rarely satisfied in
real-world applications. In this work, we extend generalization guarantees to
the broader setting of non-compact symmetries, such as translations and to
non-invariant data distributions. Building on the PAC-Bayes framework, we adapt
and tighten existing bounds, demonstrating the approach on McAllester's
PAC-Bayes bound while showing that it applies to a wide range of PAC-Bayes
bounds. We validate our theory with experiments on a rotated MNIST dataset with
a non-uniform rotation group, where the derived guarantees not only hold but
also improve upon prior results. These findings provide theoretical evidence
that, for symmetric data, symmetric models are preferable beyond the narrow
setting of compact groups and invariant distributions, opening the way to a
more general understanding of symmetries in machine learning.

Method: 构建了包含六个数据集的标准化基准，提出后验潜在探索阶段自动对齐潜在维度与语义因子，引入Koopman启发的模型，并利用视觉语言模型进行自动标注和零样本评估。

Result: Koopman模型取得了最先进的结果，视觉语言模型能够有效自动化数据集标注并作为解缠结评估器，无需人工标签和干预。

Conclusion: 这些贡献为推进多因子时序解缠结提供了稳健且可扩展的基础。

Abstract: Learning disentangled representations in sequential data is a key goal in
deep learning, with broad applications in vision, audio, and time series. While
real-world data involves multiple interacting semantic factors over time, prior
work has mostly focused on simpler two-factor static and dynamic settings,
primarily because such settings make data collection easier, thereby
overlooking the inherently multi-factor nature of real-world data. We introduce
the first standardized benchmark for evaluating multi-factor sequential
disentanglement across six diverse datasets spanning video, audio, and time
series. Our benchmark includes modular tools for dataset integration, model
development, and evaluation metrics tailored to multi-factor analysis. We
additionally propose a post-hoc Latent Exploration Stage to automatically align
latent dimensions with semantic factors, and introduce a Koopman-inspired model
that achieves state-of-the-art results. Moreover, we show that Vision-Language
Models can automate dataset annotation and serve as zero-shot disentanglement
evaluators, removing the need for manual labels and human intervention.
Together, these contributions provide a robust and scalable foundation for
advancing multi-factor sequential disentanglement.

Abstract: Reward models are essential for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with
human values, yet their development is hampered by costly preference datasets
and poor interpretability. While recent rubric-based approaches offer
transparency, they often lack systematic quality control and optimization,
creating a trade-off between scalability and reliability. We address these
limitations with a novel, training-free framework built on a key assumption:
\textit{evaluation rubrics underlying human preferences exhibit significant
generalization ability across diverse queries}, a property that enables
remarkable data efficiency. Our two-stage approach first infers high-quality,
query-specific rubrics using a validation-guided
\textbf{Propose-Evaluate-Revise} pipeline. Second, it generalizes these
granular rubrics into a compact, non-redundant core set by maximizing an
\textbf{information-theoretic coding rate}. The final output is an
interpretable, hierarchical "Theme-Tips" rubric set. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the framework's exceptional data efficiency and performance.
Critically, using just 70 preference pairs (1.5\% of the source data), our
method also empowers smaller models like Qwen3-8B to outperform specialized,
fully-trained counterparts. This work pioneers a scalable, interpretable, and
data-efficient path for reward modeling.

Abstract: We present a novel framework for training large language models with
continuously adjustable internal representations that span the full spectrum
from localist (interpretable, rule-based) to distributed (generalizable,
efficient) encodings. The key innovations are (1) a locality dial, a tunable
parameter that dynamically controls the degree of localization during both
training and inference without requiring model retraining, (2) an
information-theoretic recruitment mechanism that adaptively allocates semantic
blocks as needed, eliminating the requirement for complete domain knowledge at
initialization, and (3) a hierarchical recruitment framework that extends
capacity allocation to entire specialized LLMs, enabling multi-granularity
architectural adaptation. This is achieved through group sparsity penalties on
attention mechanisms, information-theoretic anchor design, dynamic rule
injection, and principled recruitment criteria based on penalized likelihood
with explicit units. We provide rigorous mathematical results establishing
explicit threshold conditions under which attention provably concentrates on
semantically relevant blocks at stationary points, with exact bounds on
attention entropy and pointer fidelity. The hierarchical recruitment mechanism
provides convergence guarantees at both the block level (fine-grained,
within-LLM) and the LLM level (coarse-grained, cross-domain), ensuring the
system discovers semantic partitions that balance model complexity against data
encoding efficiency. This framework enables practitioners to continuously
interpolate between interpretable and high-performance modes while adapting
architectural capacity at multiple granularities, supporting applications in

*Wei Xu,Xiaoyi Jiang,Lixiang Xu,Dechao Tang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种生成图神经网络(GNN)模型"metamers"的技术，通过优化输入图使其内部节点激活与参考图匹配，揭示了GNN存在极端表示不变性问题，与人类大脑的不变性机制存在显著差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究图神经网络中的不变性行为，因为现有研究表明人工神经网络与人类大脑在不变性特性上存在显著差距，需要探索GNN在这方面的表现。

Method: 引入模型metamers生成技术，通过优化输入图使其内部节点激活与参考图匹配，获得在模型表示空间中等价但在结构和节点特征上显著不同的图。

Result: 发现多个经典GNN架构存在极端表示不变性，虽然通过模型架构和训练策略的针对性修改可以部分缓解过度不变性，但无法从根本上弥合与人类不变性的差距。

Conclusion: 量化了metamer图与其原始对应图之间的偏差，揭示了当前GNN的独特失败模式，为模型评估提供了补充基准。

Abstract: In recent years, deep neural networks have been extensively employed in
perceptual systems to learn representations endowed with invariances, aiming to
emulate the invariance mechanisms observed in the human brain. However, studies
in the visual and auditory domains have confirmed that significant gaps remain
between the invariance properties of artificial neural networks and those of
humans. To investigate the invariance behavior within graph neural networks
(GNNs), we introduce a model ``metamers'' generation technique. By optimizing
input graphs such that their internal node activations match those of a
reference graph, we obtain graphs that are equivalent in the model's
representation space, yet differ significantly in both structure and node
features. Our theoretical analysis focuses on two aspects: the local metamer
dimension for a single node and the activation-induced volume change of the
metamer manifold. Utilizing this approach, we uncover extreme levels of
representational invariance across several classic GNN architectures. Although
targeted modifications to model architecture and training strategies can
partially mitigate this excessive invariance, they fail to fundamentally bridge
the gap to human-like invariance. Finally, we quantify the deviation between
metamer graphs and their original counterparts, revealing unique failure modes
of current GNNs and providing a complementary benchmark for model evaluation.

TL;DR: 使用物理信息神经网络(PINNs)替代昂贵的智能电网模拟器，构建代理模型来优化强化学习策略训练过程，显著提高样本效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决智能电网中强化学习训练需要大量环境迭代导致的样本效率问题，因为真实电网模拟器通常成本高昂。

Method: 采用物理信息神经网络(PINNs)构建智能电网的代理模型，替代昂贵的原始模拟器，用于强化学习策略训练。

Result: 使用PINNs代理模型能在远少于原始环境所需的时间内达到收敛结果，大幅提升训练效率。

Conclusion: PINNs作为代理模型能有效解决强化学习在智能电网应用中的样本效率问题，显著加速策略训练过程。

Abstract: Optimizing the energy management within a smart grids scenario presents
significant challenges, primarily due to the complexity of real-world systems
and the intricate interactions among various components. Reinforcement Learning
(RL) is gaining prominence as a solution for addressing the challenges of
Optimal Power Flow in smart grids. However, RL needs to iterate compulsively
throughout a given environment to obtain the optimal policy. This means
obtaining samples from a, most likely, costly simulator, which can lead to a
sample efficiency problem. In this work, we address this problem by
substituting costly smart grid simulators with surrogate models built using
Phisics-informed Neural Networks (PINNs), optimizing the RL policy training
process by arriving to convergent results in a fraction of the time employed by
the original environment.

*Achref Jaziri,Martin Rogmann,Martin Mundt,Visvanathan Ramesh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DISC是一种基于扩散模型的OOD检测方法，不仅能检测异常数据，还能对OOD类型进行分类，超越了传统标量评分方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有OOD检测方法仅将分布偏移压缩为单一标量异常分数，无法区分不同类型的OOD数据，限制了后续的上下文理解和利用。

Method: 利用扩散模型的迭代去噪过程，提取跨多个噪声级别的多维特征向量来捕捉统计差异。

Result: 在图像和表格基准测试中，DISC在OOD检测性能上达到或超越最先进方法，并首次实现了OOD类型分类能力。

Conclusion: DISC使OOD检测从简单的二元检测转向更细粒度的检测，为OOD数据的上下文理解和利用提供了新途径。

Abstract: Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) data is critical for machine learning, be
it for safety reasons or to enable open-ended learning. However, beyond mere
detection, choosing an appropriate course of action typically hinges on the
type of OOD data encountered. Unfortunately, the latter is generally not
distinguished in practice, as modern OOD detection methods collapse
distributional shifts into single scalar outlier scores. This work argues that
scalar-based methods are thus insufficient for OOD data to be properly
contextualized and prospectively exploited, a limitation we overcome with the
introduction of DISC: Diffusion-based Statistical Characterization. DISC
leverages the iterative denoising process of diffusion models to extract a
rich, multi-dimensional feature vector that captures statistical discrepancies
across multiple noise levels. Extensive experiments on image and tabular
benchmarks show that DISC matches or surpasses state-of-the-art detectors for
OOD detection and, crucially, also classifies OOD type, a capability largely
absent from prior work. As such, our work enables a shift from simple binary
OOD detection to a more granular detection.

TL;DR: 本文分析生成式视觉模型中内部表征的演变，区分严格意义上的合成（紧凑潜在空间完全决定生成过程）和广义合成（表征工作分布在多个层中），通过实验证明扩散模型如何分散表征负担并挑战统一内部空间的假设。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究生成式视觉模型内部表征的演变，从GANs和VAEs到扩散架构的概念和技术转变，探讨表征如何在不同模型架构中分布。

Method: 通过仔细阅读模型架构和有针对性的实验设置，在层级表征中进行干预，分析扩散模型如何分散表征负担。

Result: 发现扩散模型将表征负担分散到多个层中，挑战了统一内部空间的假设，表明生成过程是专门化过程的涌现配置。

Conclusion: 生成式AI应被理解为专门化过程的涌现配置，而非内容的直接合成，需要对潜在空间和柏拉图式表征假设等隐喻进行批判性反思。

Abstract: This paper examines the evolving nature of internal representations in
generative visual models, focusing on the conceptual and technical shift from
GANs and VAEs to diffusion-based architectures. Drawing on Beatrice Fazi's
account of synthesis as the amalgamation of distributed representations, we
propose a distinction between "synthesis in a strict sense", where a compact
latent space wholly determines the generative process, and "synthesis in a
broad sense," which characterizes models whose representational labor is
distributed across layers. Through close readings of model architectures and a
targeted experimental setup that intervenes in layerwise representations, we
show how diffusion models fragment the burden of representation and thereby
challenge assumptions of unified internal space. By situating these findings
within media theoretical frameworks and critically engaging with metaphors such
as the latent space and the Platonic Representation Hypothesis, we argue for a
reorientation of how generative AI is understood: not as a direct synthesis of
content, but as an emergent configuration of specialized processes.

*Pengxiang Cai,Zihao Gao,Jintai Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TabR1是首个用于表格预测的推理大语言模型，通过Permutation Relative Policy Optimization (PRPO)方法激活LLMs的推理能力，在少样本和零样本场景下表现优异，甚至能超越更大规模的LLMs。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统表格预测方法（如梯度提升决策树和专用深度学习模型）在任务内表现优秀但可解释性有限，且跨表迁移能力弱。推理LLMs具有跨任务适应性和透明推理轨迹的潜力，但尚未在表格数据上充分发挥。

Method: 提出TabR1模型，核心是Permutation Relative Policy Optimization (PRPO)方法，通过构造每个样本的多个标签保持排列，在排列内和跨排列估计优势，将稀疏奖励转化为密集学习信号，编码列排列不变性作为结构先验。

Result: TabR1在全监督微调下达到与强基线相当的性能；在零样本设置下接近32样本设置的强基线性能；TabR1 (8B)在各种任务上大幅超越更大的LLMs，相比DeepSeek-R1 (685B)提升高达53.17%。

Conclusion: PRPO方法能够有效激活LLMs在表格预测中的推理能力，显著提升少样本和零样本性能以及可解释性，证明了推理LLMs在表格数据上的巨大潜力。

Abstract: Tabular prediction has traditionally relied on gradient-boosted decision
trees and specialized deep learning models, which excel within tasks but
provide limited interpretability and weak transfer across tables. Reasoning
large language models (LLMs) promise cross-task adaptability with trans- parent
reasoning traces, yet their potential has not been fully realized for tabular
data. This paper presents TabR1, the first reasoning LLM for tabular prediction
with multi-step reasoning. At its core is Permutation Relative Policy
Optimization (PRPO), a simple yet efficient reinforcement learning method that
encodes column-permutation invariance as a structural prior. By construct- ing
multiple label-preserving permutations per sample and estimating advantages
both within and across permutations, PRPO transforms sparse rewards into dense
learning signals and improves generalization. With limited supervision, PRPO
activates the reasoning ability of LLMs for tabular prediction, enhancing
few-shot and zero-shot performance as well as interpretability. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that TabR1 achieves performance comparable to strong
baselines under full-supervision fine-tuning. In the zero-shot setting, TabR1
approaches the performance of strong baselines under the 32-shot setting.
Moreover, TabR1 (8B) substantially outperforms much larger LLMs across various
tasks, achieving up to 53.17% improvement over DeepSeek-R1 (685B).

TL;DR: 提出特征扰动技术，通过直接向特征输入注入随机性而非参数采样，实现了更优的后悔界和计算效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有随机化bandit算法通常存在O(d^{3/2}√T)的后悔界，且参数采样方法计算成本高，难以扩展到非参数或神经网络模型

Method: 特征扰动技术，直接在特征输入中注入随机性，避免参数采样和奖励噪声添加

Result: 在广义线性bandit中实现了O(d√T)的最坏情况后悔界，超越了现有方法的O(d^{3/2}√T)界限，同时保持计算高效性

Conclusion: 特征扰动技术统一了强大的理论保证和实际性能，能够自然扩展到复杂模型，超越了现有随机化bandit方法

Abstract: We propose feature perturbation, a simple yet powerful technique that injects
randomness directly into feature inputs, instead of randomizing unknown
parameters or adding noise to rewards. Remarkably, this algorithm achieves
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d\sqrt{T})$ worst-case regret bound for generalized linear
bandits, while avoiding the $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d^{3/2}\sqrt{T})$ regret
typical of existing randomized bandit algorithms. Because our algorithm eschews
parameter sampling, it is both computationally efficient and naturally extends
to non-parametric or neural network models. We verify these advantages through
empirical evaluations, demonstrating that feature perturbation not only
surpasses existing methods but also unifies strong practical performance with
best-known theoretical guarantees.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了首个针对弱通信MDP的平均奖励离线强化学习的样本复杂度分析，引入了锚定拟合Q迭代方法，通过锚机制实现有限时间分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有平均奖励离线强化学习方法依赖严格假设（如遍历性或MDP线性），而弱通信MDP假设更为宽松，需要开发新的算法和分析框架。

Method: 提出锚定拟合Q迭代方法，将标准拟合Q迭代与锚机制结合，锚机制可解释为一种权重衰减形式，对实现有限时间分析至关重要。

Result: 建立了弱通信MDP下平均奖励离线强化学习的首个样本复杂度结果，并将分析扩展到单轨迹生成数据集（而非IID转换）的情况。

Conclusion: 锚机制是实现平均奖励离线强化学习有限时间分析的关键创新，为更宽松假设下的算法提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Although there is an extensive body of work characterizing the sample
complexity of discounted-return offline RL with function approximations, prior
work on the average-reward setting has received significantly less attention,
and existing approaches rely on restrictive assumptions, such as ergodicity or
linearity of the MDP. In this work, we establish the first sample complexity
results for average-reward offline RL with function approximation for weakly
communicating MDPs, a much milder assumption. To this end, we introduce
Anchored Fitted Q-Iteration, which combines the standard Fitted Q-Iteration
with an anchor mechanism. We show that the anchor, which can be interpreted as
a form of weight decay, is crucial for enabling finite-time analysis in the
average-reward setting. We also extend our finite-time analysis to the setup
where the dataset is generated from a single-trajectory rather than IID
transitions, again leveraging the anchor mechanism.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态神经网络训练中存在模态过拟合问题，网络过度依赖某一模态导致性能次优，限制了多模态学习的潜力。

Method: MILES利用训练过程中模态条件利用率差异，动态调整学习率以平衡各模态的学习速度。

Result: 在四个多模态联合融合任务中，MILES优于七个最先进基线方法，有效平衡模态使用，提升多模态性能并增强模态编码器。

Conclusion: 平衡多模态学习对提升模型性能具有重要影响，MILES方法能有效解决模态过拟合问题。

Abstract: The aim of multimodal neural networks is to combine diverse data sources,
referred to as modalities, to achieve enhanced performance compared to relying
on a single modality. However, training of multimodal networks is typically
hindered by modality overfitting, where the network relies excessively on one
of the available modalities. This often yields sub-optimal performance,
hindering the potential of multimodal learning and resulting in marginal
improvements relative to unimodal models. In this work, we present the
Modality-Informed Learning ratE Scheduler (MILES) for training multimodal joint
fusion models in a balanced manner. MILES leverages the differences in
modality-wise conditional utilization rates during training to effectively
balance multimodal learning. The learning rate is dynamically adjusted during
training to balance the speed of learning from each modality by the multimodal
model, aiming for enhanced performance in both multimodal and unimodal
predictions. We extensively evaluate MILES on four multimodal joint fusion
tasks and compare its performance to seven state-of-the-art baselines. Our
results show that MILES outperforms all baselines across all tasks and fusion
methods considered in our study, effectively balancing modality usage during
training. This results in improved multimodal performance and stronger modality
encoders, which can be leveraged when dealing with unimodal samples or absent
modalities. Overall, our work highlights the impact of balancing multimodal
learning on improving model performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时间序列数据常受各种损坏（如缺失值、噪声、异常值）影响，现有深度学习方法需要大量预训练且在分布偏移下泛化能力差。

Method: 利用神经网络作为隐式先验，集成鲁棒优化技术，引入引导输入初始化、输入扰动和凸输出组合三个关键技术来增强优化稳定性和鲁棒性。

Result: RINS-T在不依赖高斯噪声假设的情况下，实现了高恢复性能，且对异常值具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: RINS-T提供了一个灵活有效的解决方案，能够应对复杂现实世界中的时间序列挑战。

Abstract: Time series data are often affected by various forms of corruption, such as
missing values, noise, and outliers, which pose significant challenges for
tasks such as forecasting and anomaly detection. To address these issues,
inverse problems focus on reconstructing the original signal from corrupted
data by leveraging prior knowledge about its underlying structure. While deep
learning methods have demonstrated potential in this domain, they often require
extensive pretraining and struggle to generalize under distribution shifts. In
this work, we propose RINS-T (Robust Implicit Neural Solvers for Time Series
Linear Inverse Problems), a novel deep prior framework that achieves high
recovery performance without requiring pretraining data. RINS-T leverages
neural networks as implicit priors and integrates robust optimization
techniques, making it resilient to outliers while relaxing the reliance on
Gaussian noise assumptions. To further improve optimization stability and
robustness, we introduce three key innovations: guided input initialization,
input perturbation, and convex output combination techniques. Each of these
contributions strengthens the framework's optimization stability and
robustness. These advancements make RINS-T a flexible and effective solution
for addressing complex real-world time series challenges. Our code is available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统心电图分析方法难以同时捕捉全局趋势和局部波形特征的高时间分辨率交互，需要一种能够桥接全局和局部信号分析的方法。

Method: 引入S4ECG架构，利用结构化状态空间模型进行多时段心律失常分类，通过联合多时段预测来提升性能。

Result: 多时段预测方法在宏AUROC上比单时段方法提升1.0-11.6%，心房颤动特异性从0.718-0.979提升到0.967-0.998，在分布内和分布外都表现出优越性能。

Conclusion: 这项工作推动了心律失常检测算法向时间感知范式的转变，为心电图解释特别是复杂心律失常如心房颤动和心房扑动的分析开辟了新可能性。

Abstract: The electrocardiogram (ECG) exemplifies biosignal-based time series with
continuous, temporally ordered structure reflecting cardiac physiological and
pathophysiological dynamics. Detailed analysis of these dynamics has proven
challenging, as conventional methods capture either global trends or local
waveform features but rarely their simultaneous interplay at high temporal
resolution. To bridge global and local signal analysis, we introduce S4ECG, a
novel deep learning architecture leveraging structured state space models for
multi-epoch arrhythmia classification. Our joint multi-epoch predictions
significantly outperform single-epoch approaches by 1.0-11.6% in macro-AUROC,
with atrial fibrillation specificity improving from 0.718-0.979 to 0.967-0.998,
demonstrating superior performance in-distribution and enhanced
out-of-distribution robustness. Systematic investigation reveals optimal
temporal dependency windows spanning 10-20 minutes for peak performance. This
work contributes to a paradigm shift toward temporally-aware arrhythmia
detection algorithms, opening new possibilities for ECG interpretation, in
particular for complex arrhythmias like atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of lithium-ion battery capacity and its associated
uncertainty is essential for reliable battery management but remains
challenging due to the stochastic nature of aging. This paper presents a novel
method, termed the Condition Diffusion U-Net with Attention (CDUA), which
integrates feature engineering and deep learning to address this challenge. The
proposed approach employs a diffusion-based generative model for time-series
forecasting and incorporates attention mechanisms to enhance predictive
performance. Battery capacity is first derived from real-world vehicle
operation data. The most relevant features are then identified using the
Pearson correlation coefficient and the XGBoost algorithm. These features are
used to train the CDUA model, which comprises two core components: (1) a
contextual U-Net with self-attention to capture complex temporal dependencies,
and (2) a denoising network to reconstruct accurate capacity values from noisy
observations. Experimental validation on the real-world vehicle data
demonstrates that the proposed CDUA model achieves a relative Mean Absolute
Error (MAE) of 0.94% and a relative Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 1.14%,
with a narrow 95% confidence interval of 3.74% in relative width. These results
confirm that CDUA provides both accurate capacity estimation and reliable
uncertainty quantification. Comparative experiments further verify its
robustness and superior performance over existing mainstream approaches.

Abstract: Dataset distillation aims to synthesize compact yet informative datasets from
large ones. A significant challenge in this field is achieving a trifecta of
diversity, generalization, and representativeness in a single distilled
dataset. Although recent generative dataset distillation methods adopt powerful
diffusion models as their foundation models, the inherent representativeness
prior in diffusion models is overlooked. Consequently, these approaches often
necessitate the integration of external constraints to enhance data quality. To
address this, we propose Diffusion As Priors (DAP), which formalizes
representativeness by quantifying the similarity between synthetic and real
data in feature space using a Mercer kernel. We then introduce this prior as
guidance to steer the reverse diffusion process, enhancing the
representativeness of distilled samples without any retraining. Extensive
experiments on large-scale datasets, such as ImageNet-1K and its subsets,
demonstrate that DAP outperforms state-of-the-art methods in generating
high-fidelity datasets while achieving superior cross-architecture
generalization. Our work not only establishes a theoretical connection between
diffusion priors and the objectives of dataset distillation but also provides a
practical, training-free framework for improving the quality of the distilled
dataset.

Abstract: Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) is the building block of graph
foundation models, but fundamentally suffer from oversmoothing and
oversquashing. There has recently been a surge of interest in fixing both
issues. Existing efforts primarily adopt global approaches, which may be
beneficial in some regions but detrimental in others, ultimately leading to the
suboptimal expressiveness. In this paper, we begin by revisiting oversquashing
through a global measure -- spectral gap $\lambda$ -- and prove that the
increase of $\lambda$ leads to gradient vanishing with respect to the input
features, thereby undermining the effectiveness of message passing. Motivated
by such theoretical insights, we propose a \textbf{local} approach that
adaptively adjusts message passing based on local structures. To achieve this,
we connect local Riemannian geometry with MPNNs, and establish a novel
nonhomogeneous boundary condition to address both oversquashing and
oversmoothing. Building on the Robin condition, we design a GBN network with
local bottleneck adjustment, coupled with theoretical guarantees. Extensive
experiments on homophilic and heterophilic graphs show the expressiveness of
GBN. Furthermore, GBN does not exhibit performance degradation even when the
network depth exceeds $256$ layers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于非心源性炎症模式、间质性肺病和健康肺部的高视觉变异性，区分心源性肺水肿与非心源性肺部疾病在肺部超声视频中具有挑战性，现有自动化分类方法难以处理这种异质性。

Method: 开发ZACH-ViT模型，移除位置嵌入和[CLS]标记，实现完全排列不变性；提出ShuffleStrides数据增强方法，在保持解剖有效性的同时置换探头视图序列和帧顺序。

Result: 在380个肺部超声视频上评估，ZACH-ViT获得最高的验证和测试ROC-AUC（0.80和0.79），平衡灵敏度（0.60）和特异性（0.91），而所有竞争模型都崩溃为平凡分类。

Conclusion: 将架构设计与数据结构对齐可以在小数据医学成像中超越规模效应，支持实时临床部署。

Abstract: Differentiating cardiogenic pulmonary oedema (CPE) from non-cardiogenic and
structurally normal lungs in lung ultrasound (LUS) videos remains challenging
due to the high visual variability of non-cardiogenic inflammatory patterns
(NCIP/ARDS-like), interstitial lung disease, and healthy lungs. This
heterogeneity complicates automated classification as overlapping B-lines and
pleural artefacts are common. We introduce ZACH-ViT (Zero-token Adaptive
Compact Hierarchical Vision Transformer), a 0.25 M-parameter Vision Transformer
variant that removes both positional embeddings and the [CLS] token, making it
fully permutation-invariant and suitable for unordered medical image data. To
enhance generalization, we propose ShuffleStrides Data Augmentation (SSDA),
which permutes probe-view sequences and frame orders while preserving
anatomical validity. ZACH-ViT was evaluated on 380 LUS videos from 95
critically ill patients against nine state-of-the-art baselines. Despite the
heterogeneity of the non-cardiogenic group, ZACH-ViT achieved the highest
validation and test ROC-AUC (0.80 and 0.79) with balanced sensitivity (0.60)
and specificity (0.91), while all competing models collapsed to trivial
classification. It trains 1.35x faster than Minimal ViT (0.62M parameters) with
2.5x fewer parameters, supporting real-time clinical deployment. These results
show that aligning architectural design with data structure can outperform
scale in small-data medical imaging.

TL;DR: 应用可解释AI技术（Grad-CAM和SHAP）解释PhaseNet地震检测模型的决策机制，并基于SHAP值开发了门控推理方案，在9000个波形测试集上F1分数达到0.98，优于基准模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型如PhaseNet在地震事件检测中精度高，但黑盒特性在关键应用中存在可靠性担忧，需要可解释性技术来增强模型可信度。

Method: 使用Grad-CAM可视化网络注意力，SHAP量化特征贡献，并开发了SHAP门控推理方案，结合模型输出和解释性指标来减少错误。

Result: SHAP门控模型在9000个波形测试集上F1分数0.98（精度0.99，召回率0.97），优于基准PhaseNet（F1分数0.97），对噪声具有更强的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 可解释AI不仅能解释深度学习模型，还能直接提升其性能，为构建可信的自动化地震检测器提供了模板。

Abstract: Deep neural networks like PhaseNet show high accuracy in detecting
microseismic events, but their black-box nature is a concern in critical
applications. We apply explainable AI (XAI) techniques, such as
Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) and Shapley Additive
Explanations (SHAP), to interpret the PhaseNet model's decisions and improve
its reliability. Grad-CAM highlights that the network's attention aligns with
P- and S-wave arrivals. SHAP values quantify feature contributions, confirming
that vertical-component amplitudes drive P-phase picks while horizontal
components dominate S-phase picks, consistent with geophysical principles.
Leveraging these insights, we introduce a SHAP-gated inference scheme that
combines the model's output with an explanation-based metric to reduce errors.
On a test set of 9,000 waveforms, the SHAP-gated model achieved an F1-score of
0.98 (precision 0.99, recall 0.97), outperforming the baseline PhaseNet
(F1-score 0.97) and demonstrating enhanced robustness to noise. These results
show that XAI can not only interpret deep learning models but also directly
enhance their performance, providing a template for building trust in automated
seismic detectors.

TL;DR: CrossStateECG是一个专门针对静息-运动交叉状态的心电图生物认证模型，通过多尺度深度卷积特征提取和注意力机制，在静息-运动交叉场景下实现了高精度身份识别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前心电图生物认证研究主要关注静息状态，但在静息-运动交叉场景下性能显著下降，这一问题尚未得到充分解决。

Method: 结合多尺度深度卷积特征提取和注意力机制，构建专门针对交叉状态条件的鲁棒认证模型。

Result: 在运动-ECGID数据集上，静息到运动场景识别准确率达92.50%，运动到静息场景达94.72%，静息到静息场景达99.94%，混合到混合场景达97.85%。在ECG-ID和MIT-BIH数据集上的验证进一步证实了其泛化能力。

Conclusion: CrossStateECG在动态现实场景中具有作为运动后心电图认证实用解决方案的潜力。

Abstract: Current research in Electrocardiogram (ECG) biometrics mainly emphasizes
resting-state conditions, leaving the performance decline in rest-exercise
scenarios largely unresolved. This paper introduces CrossStateECG, a robust
ECG-based authentication model explicitly tailored for cross-state
(rest-exercise) conditions. The proposed model creatively combines multi-scale
deep convolutional feature extraction with attention mechanisms to ensure
strong identification across different physiological states. Experimental
results on the exercise-ECGID dataset validate the effectiveness of
CrossStateECG, achieving an identification accuracy of 92.50% in the
Rest-to-Exercise scenario (training on resting ECG and testing on post-exercise
ECG) and 94.72% in the Exercise-to-Rest scenario (training on post-exercise ECG
and testing on resting ECG). Furthermore, CrossStateECG demonstrates
exceptional performance across both state combinations, reaching an accuracy of
99.94% in Rest-to-Rest scenarios and 97.85% in Mixed-to-Mixed scenarios.
Additional validations on the ECG-ID and MIT-BIH datasets further confirmed the
generalization abilities of CrossStateECG, underscoring its potential as a
practical solution for post-exercise ECG-based authentication in dynamic
real-world settings.

TL;DR: Transformers通过训练发展出模块化、可解释的机制来支持组合推理，在未见过的序列上表现出组合推理能力，这与层间专业化和分层表示的发展相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究Transformers在训练中未见过的序列上表现出的组合推理能力，探索其内部机制如何支持这种泛化能力。

Method: 使用随机层次模型(RHM)作为概率上下文无关文法生成序列，在序列子集上训练模型，并在四种泛化条件下评估：记忆、分布内泛化、分布外泛化（相同规则）和跨层迁移。

Result: 性能随任务复杂性和上下文示例数量系统提升，分布外任务需要更多示例；训练中出现层间专业化，与泛化性能相关；PCA和注意力模式聚类显示Transformers在专门层中发展出结构化、分层组织的表示。

Conclusion: Transformers发展出模块化、可解释的机制来支持组合推理，将内部算法结构与观察到的行为能力联系起来。

Abstract: Transformers exhibit compositional reasoning on sequences not observed during
training, a capability often attributed to in-context learning (ICL) and skill
composition. We investigate this phenomenon using the Random Hierarchy Model
(RHM), a probabilistic context-free grammar that generates sequences through
recursive rule application. Models are trained on subsets of sequences and
evaluated across four generalization conditions: memorization, in-distribution
generalization, out-of-distribution generalization with the same rules, and
cross-layer transfer. Behaviorally, performance improves systematically with
task complexity and the number of in-context examples, with out-of-distribution
tasks requiring substantially more examples than in-distribution scenarios.
Mechanistically, we identify a progressive emergence of layer specialization
during training that correlates with generalization performance. Principal
component analysis and attention pattern clustering reveal that transformers
develop structured, hierarchically organized representations in specialized
layers. These results demonstrate that transformers develop modular,
interpretable mechanisms supporting compositional reasoning, linking internal
algorithmic structure to observed behavioral capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决跨域EEG情感识别中个体间显著差异导致的泛化能力不足问题，特别是多源适应中的分布异质性和语义一致性挑战。

Method: 集成原型约束与对抗学习，使用MMD动态估计域间偏移并重新加权源贡献，通过原型引导的条件对齐模块增强伪标签可靠性。

Result: 在SEED和SEED-IV数据集上，跨被试平均准确率分别为94.86%和79.78%，跨会话分别为95.12%和83.15%；在FACED数据集上跨被试准确率达82.88%。

Conclusion: DAMSDAN框架通过分布感知的多源域适应有效解决了跨域EEG情感识别问题，消融实验和可解释性分析验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Significant inter-individual variability limits the generalization of
EEG-based emotion recognition under cross-domain settings. We address two core
challenges in multi-source adaptation: (1) dynamically modeling distributional
heterogeneity across sources and quantifying their relevance to a target to
reduce negative transfer; and (2) achieving fine-grained semantic consistency
to strengthen class discrimination. We propose a distribution-aware
multi-source domain adaptation network (DAMSDAN). DAMSDAN integrates
prototype-based constraints with adversarial learning to drive the encoder
toward discriminative, domain-invariant emotion representations. A domain-aware
source weighting strategy based on maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) dynamically
estimates inter-domain shifts and reweights source contributions. In addition,
a prototype-guided conditional alignment module with dual pseudo-label
interaction enhances pseudo-label reliability and enables category-level,
fine-grained alignment, mitigating noise propagation and semantic drift.
Experiments on SEED and SEED-IV show average accuracies of 94.86\% and 79.78\%
for cross-subject, and 95.12\% and 83.15\% for cross-session protocols. On the
large-scale FACED dataset, DAMSDAN achieves 82.88\% (cross-subject). Extensive
ablations and interpretability analyses corroborate the effectiveness of the
proposed framework for cross-domain EEG-based emotion recognition.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 地下决策成本高且不确定性大，获取新数据难以扩展。将地质知识直接嵌入预测模型提供了有价值的替代方案。

Method: 使用生成对抗网络(GAN)训练生成河流沉积物模型，并应用四种反演方法匹配井数据和地震数据。通过标签条件化、潜在空间过参数化和微调来改善潜在空间结构。

Result: 四种反演方法在4、8、20口井的三个测试样本中难以匹配井数据，特别是井数增加或测试样本与训练数据差异大时。微调GAN可以显著减少不匹配，达到可接受水平。

Conclusion: GANs已能胜任地质建模工作流程中的任务，但需要进一步评估其鲁棒性以及如何最好地支持地质解释。

Abstract: High costs and uncertainties make subsurface decision-making challenging, as
acquiring new data is rarely scalable. Embedding geological knowledge directly
into predictive models offers a valuable alternative. A joint approach enables
just that: process-based models that mimic geological processes can help train
generative models that make predictions more efficiently. This study explores
whether a generative adversarial network (GAN) - a type of deep-learning
algorithm for generative modeling - trained to produce fluvial deposits can be
inverted to match well and seismic data. Four inversion approaches applied to
three test samples with 4, 8, and 20 wells struggled to match these well data,
especially as the well number increased or as the test sample diverged from the
training data. The key bottleneck lies in the GAN's latent representation: it
is entangled, so samples with similar sedimentological features are not
necessarily close in the latent space. Label conditioning or latent
overparameterization can partially disentangle the latent space during
training, although not yet sufficiently for a successful inversion. Fine-tuning
the GAN to restructure the latent space locally reduces mismatches to
acceptable levels for all test cases, with and without seismic data. But this
approach depends on an initial, partially successful inversion step, which
influences the quality and diversity of the final samples. Overall, GANs can
already handle the tasks required for their integration into geomodeling
workflows. We still need to further assess their robustness, and how to best
leverage them in support of geological interpretation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 去中心化学习虽然能保护数据隐私，但实践中观察到的隐私-效用权衡往往比集中式训练更差，这可能是由于当前DP会计方法的局限性。

Method: 通过推广现有的矩阵分解结果，将标准DL算法和常见信任模型统一到一个框架中，并开发了具有用户级相关噪声的gossip-based DL算法MAFALDA-SGD。

Result: 该方法为现有DP-DL算法提供了更严格的隐私会计，并在合成和真实世界图上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 矩阵分解方法可以显著改进去中心化学习中的差分隐私会计，为开发新的DP-DL算法提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Decentralized Learning (DL) enables users to collaboratively train models
without sharing raw data by iteratively averaging local updates with neighbors
in a network graph. This setting is increasingly popular for its scalability
and its ability to keep data local under user control. Strong privacy
guarantees in DL are typically achieved through Differential Privacy (DP), with
results showing that DL can even amplify privacy by disseminating noise across
peer-to-peer communications. Yet in practice, the observed privacy-utility
trade-off often appears worse than in centralized training, which may be due to
limitations in current DP accounting methods for DL. In this paper, we show
that recent advances in centralized DP accounting based on Matrix Factorization
(MF) for analyzing temporal noise correlations can also be leveraged in DL. By
generalizing existing MF results, we show how to cast both standard DL
algorithms and common trust models into a unified formulation. This yields
tighter privacy accounting for existing DP-DL algorithms and provides a
principled way to develop new ones. To demonstrate the approach, we introduce
MAFALDA-SGD, a gossip-based DL algorithm with user-level correlated noise that
outperforms existing methods on synthetic and real-world graphs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为神经网络提供形式化的局部几何分析工具，连接优化几何与功能行为，指导网络架构设计和训练稳定性改进。

Method: 定义每个功能块（层）的局部Hessian矩阵作为参数二阶导数矩阵，分析其谱特性（如特征值分布），在37个数据集上进行了111次实验验证。

Result: 发现训练过程中局部Hessian存在一致的结构规律，其谱特征与泛化性能存在相关性，揭示了与过拟合、欠参数化和表达能力相关的定量模式。

Conclusion: 局部几何分析为深度神经网络的诊断和设计提供了理论基础，建立了优化几何与功能行为之间的联系。

Abstract: We introduce a methodology for analyzing neural networks through the lens of
layer-wise Hessian matrices. The local Hessian of each functional block (layer)
is defined as the matrix of second derivatives of a scalar function with
respect to the parameters of that layer. This concept provides a formal tool
for characterizing the local geometry of the parameter space. We show that the
spectral properties of local Hessians, such as the distribution of eigenvalues,
reveal quantitative patterns associated with overfitting,
underparameterization, and expressivity in neural network architectures. We
conduct an extensive empirical study involving 111 experiments across 37
datasets. The results demonstrate consistent structural regularities in the
evolution of local Hessians during training and highlight correlations between
their spectra and generalization performance. These findings establish a
foundation for using local geometric analysis to guide the diagnosis and design
of deep neural networks. The proposed framework connects optimization geometry
with functional behavior and offers practical insight for improving network
architectures and training stability.

Motivation: 评估大语言模型和大推理模型在复杂推理任务中的泛化能力和鲁棒性，特别是在面对不确定性时的表现。

Method: 扩展I-RAVEN基准测试，增加操作数复杂度、扩大属性范围，并引入感知不确定性来创建更复杂的推理场景。

Result: 相比大语言模型，大推理模型在更长的推理关系和更广的属性范围上表现出更好的生产力和系统性。但大推理模型在处理不确定性推理和探索多个概率结果方面仍有显著挑战。

Conclusion: 大推理模型在复杂推理任务上优于大语言模型，但在处理不确定性和概率推理方面仍存在明显局限，需要进一步改进。

Abstract: We introduce I-RAVEN-X, a symbolic benchmark designed to evaluate
generalization and robustness in analogical and mathematical reasoning for
Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Reasoning Models (LRMs). I-RAVEN-X
extends I-RAVEN by increasing operand complexity, attribute range, and
introducing perceptual uncertainty. Compared to LLMs, empirical results show
that LRMs achieve improved productivity and systematicity on longer reasoning
relations and wider attribute ranges, respectively. However, LRMs are still
significantly challenged by reasoning under uncertainty and cannot effectively
explore multiple probabilistic outcomes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有随机DC优化方法通常需要大批次或强噪声假设，限制了实际应用，需要研究小批次下的收敛性。

Method: 提出基于动量的算法，在标准光滑性和有界方差假设下实现收敛。

Result: 证明无动量时无论步长如何都可能不收敛，动量方法具有可证明的收敛性和强实证性能。

Conclusion: 动量是实现随机DC优化收敛的关键，解决了小批次训练的收敛问题。

Abstract: Stochastic difference-of-convex (DC) optimization is prevalent in numerous
machine learning applications, yet its convergence properties under small batch
sizes remain poorly understood. Existing methods typically require large
batches or strong noise assumptions, which limit their practical use. In this
work, we show that momentum enables convergence under standard smoothness and
bounded variance assumptions (of the concave part) for any batch size. We prove
that without momentum, convergence may fail regardless of stepsize,
highlighting its necessity. Our momentum-based algorithm achieves provable
convergence and demonstrates strong empirical performance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文分析了过参数化最小二乘问题中梯度下降在大学习率下的收敛行为，揭示了学习率大小如何影响收敛到平坦最小值的动态过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统优化理论只保证小学习率下梯度下降的单调收敛，但神经网络训练常使用大学习率，在"稳定性边缘"区域表现出非单调收敛和对平坦最小值的隐式偏好，需要理论解释。

Method: 利用过参数化使全局最小值形成黎曼流形，将梯度下降动态分解为平行和正交于流形的分量，分别对应黎曼梯度下降和分叉动力系统。

Result: 识别了三种学习率区域：(a)亚临界区域：有限时间内克服瞬时不稳定性，线性收敛到次优平坦最小值；(b)临界区域：不稳定性持续存在，以幂律收敛到最优平坦最小值；(c)超临界区域：不稳定性持续存在，线性收敛到周期为2的轨道。

Conclusion: 过参数化使梯度下降在大学习率下具有复杂的收敛动态，学习率大小决定了收敛到平坦最小值的路径和速度，为理解神经网络训练中的"稳定性边缘"现象提供了理论框架。

Abstract: Classical optimisation theory guarantees monotonic objective decrease for
gradient descent (GD) when employed in a small step size, or ``stable", regime.
In contrast, gradient descent on neural networks is frequently performed in a
large step size regime called the ``edge of stability", in which the objective
decreases non-monotonically with an observed implicit bias towards flat minima.
In this paper, we take a step toward quantifying this phenomenon by providing
convergence rates for gradient descent with large learning rates in an
overparametrised least squares setting. The key insight behind our analysis is
that, as a consequence of overparametrisation, the set of global minimisers
forms a Riemannian manifold $M$, which enables the decomposition of the GD
dynamics into components parallel and orthogonal to $M$. The parallel component
corresponds to Riemannian gradient descent on the objective sharpness, while
the orthogonal component is a bifurcating dynamical system. This insight allows
us to derive convergence rates in three regimes characterised by the learning
rate size: (a) the subcritical regime, in which transient instability is
overcome in finite time before linear convergence to a suboptimally flat global
minimum; (b) the critical regime, in which instability persists for all time
with a power-law convergence toward the optimally flat global minimum; and (c)
the supercritical regime, in which instability persists for all time with
linear convergence to an orbit of period two centred on the optimally flat
global minimum.

Conclusion: 该框架为稀疏网络的理论分析提供了通用框架，揭示了连接模式对各种稀疏网络架构可训练性的理论影响。

Abstract: Sparse neural networks promise efficiency, yet training them effectively
remains a fundamental challenge. Despite advances in pruning methods that
create sparse architectures, understanding why some sparse structures are
better trainable than others with the same level of sparsity remains poorly
understood. Aiming to develop a systematic approach to this fundamental
problem, we propose a novel theoretical framework based on the theory of graph
limits, particularly graphons, that characterizes sparse neural networks in the
infinite-width regime. Our key insight is that connectivity patterns of sparse
neural networks induced by pruning methods converge to specific graphons as
networks' width tends to infinity, which encodes implicit structural biases of
different pruning methods. We postulate the Graphon Limit Hypothesis and
provide empirical evidence to support it. Leveraging this graphon
representation, we derive a Graphon Neural Tangent Kernel (Graphon NTK) to
study the training dynamics of sparse networks in the infinite width limit.
Graphon NTK provides a general framework for the theoretical analysis of sparse
networks. We empirically show that the spectral analysis of Graphon NTK
correlates with observed training dynamics of sparse networks, explaining the
varying convergence behaviours of different pruning methods. Our framework
provides theoretical insights into the impact of connectivity patterns on the
trainability of various sparse network architectures.

<details>

Motivation: 现有研究主要关注功能性临时异常（如疲劳、分心），但缺乏对病理性异常（特别是慢性疾病如帕金森病）的检测机制，这给公共交通安全带来风险。

Method: 1) 分析帕金森病症状学与驾驶表现的关系；2) 整合多源车辆控制数据构建行为档案；3) 设计基于注意力的网络自适应优先处理时空特征；4) 在Logitech G29平台和CARLA模拟器上验证。

Result: SAFE-D在区分正常和帕金森病影响的驾驶模式方面达到96.8%的平均准确率，在三个道路地图的模拟驾驶数据上验证有效。

Conclusion: SAFE-D框架能够有效检测帕金森病相关的驾驶行为异常，为改善驾驶安全提供了新方法，特别是在处理慢性疾病引起的病理性异常方面具有重要价值。

Abstract: A driver's health state serves as a determinant factor in driving behavioral
regulation. Subtle deviations from normalcy can lead to operational anomalies,
posing risks to public transportation safety. While prior efforts have
developed detection mechanisms for functionally-driven temporary anomalies such
as drowsiness and distraction, limited research has addressed
pathologically-triggered deviations, especially those stemming from chronic
medical conditions. To bridge this gap, we investigate the driving behavior of
Parkinson's disease patients and propose SAFE-D, a novel framework for
detecting Parkinson-related behavioral anomalies to enhance driving safety. Our
methodology starts by performing analysis of Parkinson's disease
symptomatology, focusing on primary motor impairments, and establishes causal
links to degraded driving performance. To represent the subclinical behavioral
variations of early-stage Parkinson's disease, our framework integrates data
from multiple vehicle control components to build a behavioral profile. We then
design an attention-based network that adaptively prioritizes spatiotemporal
features, enabling robust anomaly detection under physiological variability.
Finally, we validate SAFE-D on the Logitech G29 platform and CARLA simulator,
using data from three road maps to emulate real-world driving. Our results show
SAFE-D achieves 96.8% average accuracy in distinguishing normal and
Parkinson-affected driving patterns.

TL;DR: 提出CD-GTMLL框架，将多标签学习建模为合作博弈，通过好奇心奖励机制解决长尾不平衡问题，无需手动调整类别权重。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多标签学习中存在长尾不平衡问题：少数头部标签主导梯度信号，而实践中重要的许多稀有标签被忽略。

Method: 将标签空间分割给多个合作玩家，共享全局准确率收益，同时根据标签稀有度和玩家间分歧获得额外好奇心奖励，这些奖励为代表性不足的标签注入梯度。

Result: 在传统基准测试和三个超大规模数据集上取得最先进的性能提升，Rare-F1提升高达+4.3%，P@3提升+1.6%。消融实验显示出现了劳动分工和稀有类别上更快的共识。

Conclusion: CD-GTMLL为多标签预测中的长尾鲁棒性提供了一种原则性、可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Long-tail imbalance is endemic to multi-label learning: a few head labels
dominate the gradient signal, while the many rare labels that matter in
practice are silently ignored. We tackle this problem by casting the task as a
cooperative potential game. In our Curiosity-Driven Game-Theoretic Multi-Label
Learning (CD-GTMLL) framework, the label space is split among several
cooperating players that share a global accuracy payoff yet earn additional
curiosity rewards that rise with label rarity and inter-player disagreement.
These curiosity bonuses inject gradient on under-represented tags without
hand-tuned class weights. We prove that gradient best-response updates ascend a
differentiable potential and converge to tail-aware stationary points that
tighten a lower bound on the expected Rare-F1. Extensive experiments on
conventional benchmarks and three extreme-scale datasets show consistent
state-of-the-art gains, delivering up to +4.3% Rare-F1 and +1.6% P@3 over the
strongest baselines, while ablations reveal emergent division of labour and
faster consensus on rare classes. CD-GTMLL thus offers a principled, scalable
route to long-tail robustness in multi-label prediction.

Motivation: 现有基于组分布鲁棒性的方法（如DFR）依赖显式组标签，面临组标签不可得、组内样本少、多虚假相关导致组碎片化等问题，限制了实际应用。

Method: 通过生成多样反事实样本，让人类标注者高效探索和修正模型决策边界，通过知识蒸馏步骤不仅重加权欠采样组，还为其补充新数据点。

Conclusion: CFKD提供了一种无需组标签的鲁棒性提升方法，能够有效处理多虚假相关性问题，在低数据场景下表现突出，为实际工业应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Deep learning models remain vulnerable to spurious correlations, leading to
so-called Clever Hans predictors that undermine robustness even in large-scale
foundation and self-supervised models. Group distributional robustness methods,
such as Deep Feature Reweighting (DFR) rely on explicit group labels to
upweight underrepresented subgroups, but face key limitations: (1) group labels
are often unavailable, (2) low within-group sample sizes hinder coverage of the
subgroup distribution, and (3) performance degrades sharply when multiple
spurious correlations fragment the data into even smaller groups. We propose
Counterfactual Knowledge Distillation (CFKD), a framework that sidesteps these
issues by generating diverse counterfactuals, enabling a human annotator to
efficiently explore and correct the model's decision boundaries through a
knowledge distillation step. Unlike DFR, our method not only reweights the
undersampled groups, but it also enriches them with new data points. Our method
does not require any confounder labels, achieves effective scaling to multiple
confounders, and yields balanced generalization across groups. We demonstrate

*Wei Huang,Andi Han,Yujin Song,Yilan Chen,Denny Wu,Difan Zou,Taiji Suzuki*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 在低信噪比数据场景下，引入标签噪声到梯度下降训练中能抑制噪声记忆化，改善神经网络泛化性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型容易在训练中记忆噪声，特别是在低信噪比数据中导致泛化能力差。受标签噪声具有隐式正则化作用的启发，研究在梯度更新中引入标签噪声是否能提升神经网络在低信噪比场景下的测试性能

Method: 采用两层神经网络，在理想化的信号-噪声数据设置中，使用带标签噪声的梯度下降算法进行训练

Result: 标签噪声训练能抑制噪声记忆化，防止噪声主导学习过程，实现信号快速增长同时控制过拟合，从而获得良好泛化能力。相比之下，标准梯度下降在相同低信噪比设置下容易过拟合噪声

Conclusion: 在基于梯度的训练中引入标签噪声对低信噪比场景下的神经网络泛化具有显著益处

Abstract: The capacity of deep learning models is often large enough to both learn the
underlying statistical signal and overfit to noise in the training set. This
noise memorization can be harmful especially for data with a low
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), leading to poor generalization. Inspired by prior
observations that label noise provides implicit regularization that improves
generalization, in this work, we investigate whether introducing label noise to
the gradient updates can enhance the test performance of neural network (NN) in
the low SNR regime. Specifically, we consider training a two-layer NN with a
simple label noise gradient descent (GD) algorithm, in an idealized
signal-noise data setting. We prove that adding label noise during training
suppresses noise memorization, preventing it from dominating the learning
process; consequently, label noise GD enjoys rapid signal growth while the
overfitting remains controlled, thereby achieving good generalization despite
the low SNR. In contrast, we also show that NN trained with standard GD tends
to overfit to noise in the same low SNR setting and establish a non-vanishing
lower bound on its test error, thus demonstrating the benefit of introducing
label noise in gradient-based training.

*Jiayi Huang,Sangwoo Park,Nicola Paoletti,Osvaldo Simeone*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于保形对齐的边云级联方法(CAb)，通过多假设检验确保边缘预测集满足云模型级别的条件覆盖保证，在减少云卸载的同时保持目标覆盖概率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 边缘智能虽然能通过紧凑的本地模型实现低延迟推理，但保证可靠性仍然具有挑战性。需要确保边缘预测集在条件覆盖方面能达到云模型级别的可靠性。

Method: 将边缘到云的升级过程建模为多假设检验问题，采用保形对齐(CA)来选择哪些输入可以在边缘安全处理。该方法适用于任意边缘预测集，包括各种保形预测变体。

Result: 在CIFAR-100图像分类和TeleQnA问答基准测试中，CAb级联方法在保持目标条件覆盖的同时，显著减少了向云的卸载，预测集大小仅有适度增加。

Conclusion: CAb级联方法为边缘预测提供了统计保证，在覆盖概率、延迟率和集合大小之间提供了可调节的权衡，有效解决了边缘智能的可靠性挑战。

Abstract: Edge intelligence enables low-latency inference via compact on-device models,
but assuring reliability remains challenging. We study edge-cloud cascades that
must preserve conditional coverage: whenever the edge returns a prediction set,
it should contain the true label with a user-specified probability, as if
produced by the cloud model. We formalize conditional coverage with respect to
the cloud predictive distribution, and introduce a conformal alignment-based
(CAb) cascading mechanism that certifies this property with user control over
the risk level. Our method casts escalation from edge to cloud models as a
multiple-hypothesis testing (MHT) problem, tailoring conformal alignment (CA)
to select which inputs can be safely handled at the edge. The proposed CAb
model cascading method yields statistical guarantees on the average fraction of
edge decisions that satisfy cloud-level conditional coverage. The procedure
applies to arbitrary edge prediction sets, including variants of conformal
prediction (CP), and exposes a tunable trade-off among coverage, deferral rate,
and set size. Experiments on CIFAR-100 image classification and the TeleQnA
question-answering (QA) benchmark show that the proposed CAb cascade maintains
the target conditional coverage for edge predictions while substantially
reducing offloading to the cloud and incurring modest increases in
prediction-set size.

Conclusion: TrajMamba能够有效解决轨迹学习中的计算负担和冗余问题，实现高效且语义丰富的车辆轨迹学习。

Abstract: Vehicle GPS trajectories record how vehicles move over time, storing valuable
travel semantics, including movement patterns and travel purposes. Learning
travel semantics effectively and efficiently is crucial for real-world
applications of trajectory data, which is hindered by two major challenges.
First, travel purposes are tied to the functions of the roads and
points-of-interest (POIs) involved in a trip. Such information is encoded in
textual addresses and descriptions and introduces heavy computational burden to
modeling. Second, real-world trajectories often contain redundant points, which
harm both computational efficiency and trajectory embedding quality. To address
these challenges, we propose TrajMamba, a novel approach for efficient and
semantically rich vehicle trajectory learning. TrajMamba introduces a
Traj-Mamba Encoder that captures movement patterns by jointly modeling both GPS
and road perspectives of trajectories, enabling robust representations of
continuous travel behaviors. It also incorporates a Travel Purpose-aware
Pre-training procedure to integrate travel purposes into the learned embeddings
without introducing extra overhead to embedding calculation. To reduce
redundancy in trajectories, TrajMamba features a Knowledge Distillation
Pre-training scheme to identify key trajectory points through a learnable mask
generator and obtain effective compressed trajectory embeddings. Extensive
experiments on two real-world datasets and three downstream tasks show that
TrajMamba outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both efficiency and
accuracy.

Motivation: 当前时间序列异常检测方法的性能评估存在缺陷，现有指标只能捕捉任务的狭窄方面且经常产生误导性结果，这可能导致安全关键系统中的灾难性故障。

Method: 引入可验证属性来形式化评估时间序列异常检测的基本要求，构建理论框架支持原则性评估和可靠比较，并提出新的指标LARM和ALARM。

Result: 分析37个广泛使用的指标发现，大多数只满足少数属性，没有一个满足所有属性，这解释了先前结果中持续存在的不一致性。

Conclusion: 提出的LARM指标可证明满足所有属性，ALARM变体满足更严格的要求，填补了现有评估指标的空白。

Abstract: Undetected anomalies in time series can trigger catastrophic failures in
safety-critical systems, such as chemical plant explosions or power grid
outages. Although many detection methods have been proposed, their performance
remains unclear because current metrics capture only narrow aspects of the task
and often yield misleading results. We address this issue by introducing
verifiable properties that formalize essential requirements for evaluating
time-series anomaly detection. These properties enable a theoretical framework
that supports principled evaluations and reliable comparisons. Analyzing 37
widely used metrics, we show that most satisfy only a few properties, and none
satisfy all, explaining persistent inconsistencies in prior results. To close
this gap, we propose LARM, a flexible metric that provably satisfies all
properties, and extend it to ALARM, an advanced variant meeting stricter
requirements.

Motivation: 抗菌肽是治疗细菌感染的有前景疗法，但序列空间巨大使得发现和设计困难。现有的深度生成模型缺乏解释性且难以量化潜在空间质量作为搜索空间。

Method: 使用变分自编码器等深度生成模型，结合降维技术压缩设计空间，并通过理化性质组织潜在空间，在不同标签可用性条件下进行优化。

Result: 发现当数据可用性较高时，通过降维进一步压缩潜在空间是有利的；降维搜索空间更具解释性；可以在不同标签百分比下用不同理化性质组织潜在空间。

Conclusion: 降维方法可以改善抗菌肽设计空间的优化效率，提高潜在空间的解释性，并能有效利用理化性质信息来组织搜索空间。

Abstract: Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are a promising class of therapeutics to treat
bacterial infections. Discovering and designing such peptides is difficult
because of the vast number of possible sequences of amino acids. Deep
generative models, such as variational autoencoders, have shown value in
peptide design due to their ability to model sequence space with a
continuous-valued latent space. Although such models have already been used to
great effect in biomolecular design, they still suffer from a lack of
interpretability and rigorous quantification of latent space quality as a
search space. We investigate (1) whether further compression of the design
space via dimensionality reduction may facilitate optimization, (2) the
interpretability of the spaces, and (3) how organizing latent spaces with
physicochemical properties may improve the efficiency of optimizing
antimicrobial activity. We find that further reduction of the latent space via
dimensionality reduction can be advantageous when organizing the space with
more relevant information at data availability, that using the dimensionality
reduction search space can be more interpretable, and that we can organize the
latent space with different physicochemical properties even at different
percentages of available labels.

TL;DR: CEPerFed是一种通信高效的个性化联邦学习方法，通过客户端历史风险梯度和历史平均梯度协调本地与全局优化，并使用分层SVD策略减少通信开销，有效解决了多脉冲MRI分类中的数据异构性和通信负担问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多脉冲MRI在阿尔茨海默病诊断等临床实践中广泛应用，需要大量多样化数据训练鲁棒模型，但医疗机构的隐私保护要求限制了原始数据共享。联邦学习虽然可行，但面临数据异构性导致的模型收敛问题和大量参数传输带来的通信开销挑战。

Method: 提出CEPerFed方法：1）使用客户端历史风险梯度对其他客户端贡献进行加权，增强本地更新的可靠性；2）使用历史平均梯度确保本地更新与全局优化方向一致；3）采用分层SVD策略仅传输模型更新所需的关键信息以减少通信开销。

Result: 在五个分类任务上的实验证明了CEPerFed方法的有效性，能够稳定收敛于异构数据分布，同时显著降低通信负担。

Conclusion: CEPerFed通过协调本地与全局优化以及高效的通信策略，成功解决了联邦学习在多脉冲MRI分类中的数据异构性和通信开销问题，为医疗领域的隐私保护机器学习提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Multi-pulse magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is widely utilized for clinical
practice such as Alzheimer's disease diagnosis. To train a robust model for
multi-pulse MRI classification, it requires large and diverse data from various
medical institutions while protecting privacy by preventing raw data sharing
across institutions. Although federated learning (FL) is a feasible solution to
address this issue, it poses challenges of model convergence due to the effect
of data heterogeneity and substantial communication overhead due to large
numbers of parameters transmitted within the model. To address these
challenges, we propose CEPerFed, a communication-efficient personalized FL
method. It mitigates the effect of data heterogeneity by incorporating
client-side historical risk gradients and historical mean gradients to
coordinate local and global optimization. The former is used to weight the
contributions from other clients, enhancing the reliability of local updates,
while the latter enforces consistency between local updates and the global
optimization direction to ensure stable convergence across heterogeneous data
distributions. To address the high communication overhead, we propose a
hierarchical SVD (HSVD) strategy that transmits only the most critical
information required for model updates. Experiments on five classification
tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the CEPerFed method. The code will be
released upon acceptance at https://github.com/LD0416/CEPerFed.

TL;DR: 使用机器学习和深度学习技术（特别是GAN）来生成合成数据，解决自杀预测中数据稀缺和类别不平衡问题，在真实测试数据上取得了良好的预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自杀预测是预防的关键，但真实数据中阳性样本稀少，导致极端类别不平衡问题，需要数据增强来改善模型训练。

Method: 使用机器学习模型（逻辑回归、随机森林、支持向量机）和深度学习技术（生成对抗网络GAN）生成合成数据样本来增强数据集。初始数据集包含656个样本，其中只有4个阳性案例。

Result: 在真实测试数据上：逻辑回归的加权精度0.99、召回率0.85、F1分数0.91；随机森林分别为0.98、0.99、0.99；支持向量机为0.99、0.76、0.86。逻辑回归和SVM正确识别了1个自杀尝试案例（敏感度1.0），但分别误分类了20和31个非尝试案例。

Conclusion: 这些结果证明了模型的有效性，GAN在生成合成数据以支持自杀预防建模工作中发挥了关键作用。

Abstract: Suicide prediction is the key for prevention, but real data with sufficient
positive samples is rare and causes extreme class imbalance. We utilized
machine learning (ML) to build the model and deep learning (DL) techniques,
like Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), to generate synthetic data samples
to enhance the dataset. The initial dataset contained 656 samples, with only
four positive cases, prompting the need for data augmentation. A variety of
machine learning models, ranging from interpretable data models to black box
algorithmic models, were used. On real test data, Logistic Regression (LR)
achieved a weighted precision of 0.99, a weighted recall of 0.85, and a
weighted F1 score of 0.91; Random Forest (RF) showed 0.98, 0.99, and 0.99,
respectively; and Support Vector Machine (SVM) achieved 0.99, 0.76, and 0.86.
LR and SVM correctly identified one suicide attempt case (sensitivity:1.0) and
misclassified LR(20) and SVM (31) non-attempts as attempts (specificity: 0.85 &
0.76, respectively). RF identified 0 suicide attempt cases (sensitivity: 0.0)
with 0 false positives (specificity: 1.0). These results highlight the models'
effectiveness, with GAN playing a key role in generating synthetic data to
support suicide prevention modeling efforts.

Conclusion: 建立了一个实用且资源高效的框架，使基础模型能够快速适应特定用户需求，大幅降低遥感图像标注成本。

Abstract: Open-vocabulary object detection (OVD) models offer remarkable flexibility by
detecting objects from arbitrary text queries. However, their zero-shot
performance in specialized domains like Remote Sensing (RS) is often
compromised by the inherent ambiguity of natural language, limiting critical
downstream applications. For instance, an OVD model may struggle to distinguish
between fine-grained classes such as "fishing boat" and "yacht" since their
embeddings are similar and often inseparable. This can hamper specific user
goals, such as monitoring illegal fishing, by producing irrelevant detections.
To address this, we propose a cascaded approach that couples the broad
generalization of a large pre-trained OVD model with a lightweight few-shot
classifier. Our method first employs the zero-shot model to generate
high-recall object proposals. These proposals are then refined for high
precision by a compact classifier trained in real-time on only a handful of
user-annotated examples - drastically reducing the high costs of RS imagery
annotation.The core of our framework is FLAME, a one-step active learning
strategy that selects the most informative samples for training. FLAME
identifies, on the fly, uncertain marginal candidates near the decision
boundary using density estimation, followed by clustering to ensure sample
diversity. This efficient sampling technique achieves high accuracy without
costly full-model fine-tuning and enables instant adaptation, within less then
a minute, which is significantly faster than state-of-the-art alternatives.Our
method consistently surpasses state-of-the-art performance on RS benchmarks,
establishing a practical and resource-efficient framework for adapting
foundation models to specific user needs.

Conclusion: 语言在环框架结合了LLM的灵活性和贝叶斯优化的效率，为复杂优化问题提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: For many real-world applications, feedback is essential in translating
complex, nuanced, or subjective goals into quantifiable optimization
objectives. We propose a language-in-the-loop framework that uses a large
language model (LLM) to convert unstructured feedback in the form of natural
language into scalar utilities to conduct BO over a numeric search space.
Unlike preferential BO, which only accepts restricted feedback formats and
requires customized models for each domain-specific problem, our approach
leverages LLMs to turn varied types of textual feedback into consistent utility
signals and to easily include flexible user priors without manual kernel
design. At the same time, our method maintains the sample efficiency and
principled uncertainty quantification of BO. We show that this hybrid method
not only provides a more natural interface to the decision maker but also
outperforms conventional BO baselines and LLM-only optimizers, particularly in
feedback-limited regimes.

Abstract: This dissertation makes three main contributions. First, We identify a new
connection between policy gradient and dynamic programming in MMDPs and propose
the Coordinate Ascent Dynamic Programming (CADP) algorithm to compute a Markov
policy that maximizes the discounted return averaged over the uncertain models.
CADP adjusts model weights iteratively to guarantee monotone policy
improvements to a local maximum. Second, We establish sufficient and necessary
conditions for the exponential ERM Bellman operator to be a contraction and
prove the existence of stationary deterministic optimal policies for ERM-TRC
and EVaR-TRC. We also propose exponential value iteration, policy iteration,
and linear programming algorithms for computing optimal stationary policies for
ERM-TRC and EVaR-TRC. Third, We propose model-free Q-learning algorithms for
computing policies with risk-averse objectives: ERM-TRC and EVaR-TRC. The
challenge is that Q-learning ERM Bellman may not be a contraction. Instead, we
use the monotonicity of Q-learning ERM Bellman operators to derive a rigorous
proof that the ERM-TRC and the EVaR-TRC Q-learning algorithms converge to the
optimal risk-averse value functions. The proposed Q-learning algorithms compute
the optimal stationary policy for ERM-TRC and EVaR-TRC.

Abstract: Sim2Real aims at training policies in high-fidelity simulation environments
and effectively transferring them to the real world. Despite the developments
of accurate simulators and Sim2Real RL approaches, the policies trained purely
in simulation often suffer significant performance drops when deployed in real
environments. This drop is referred to as the Sim2Real performance gap. Current
Sim2Real RL methods optimize the simulator accuracy and variability as proxies
for real-world performance. However, these metrics do not necessarily correlate
with the real-world performance of the policy as established theoretically and
empirically in the literature. We propose a novel framework to address this
issue by directly adapting the simulator parameters based on real-world
performance. We frame this problem as a bi-level RL framework: the inner-level
RL trains a policy purely in simulation, and the outer-level RL adapts the
simulation model and in-sim reward parameters to maximize real-world
performance of the in-sim policy. We derive and validate in simple examples the
mathematical tools needed to develop bi-level RL algorithms that close the
Sim2Real performance gap.

Abstract: Black-box Large Language Models (LLMs) provide practical and accessible
alternatives to other machine learning methods, as they require minimal labeled
data and machine learning expertise to develop solutions for various decision
making problems. However, for applications that need operating with constraints
on specific metrics (e.g., precision $\geq$ 95%), decision making with
black-box LLMs remains unfavorable, due to their low numerical output
cardinalities. This results in limited control over their operating points,
preventing fine-grained adjustment of their decision making behavior. In this
paper, we study using black-box LLMs as classifiers, focusing on efficiently
improving their operational granularity without performance loss. Specifically,
we first investigate the reasons behind their low-cardinality numerical outputs
and show that they are biased towards generating rounded but informative
verbalized probabilities. Then, we experiment with standard prompt engineering,
uncertainty estimation and confidence elicitation techniques, and observe that
they do not effectively improve operational granularity without sacrificing
performance or increasing inference cost. Finally, we propose efficient
approaches to significantly increase the number and diversity of available
operating points. Our proposed approaches provide finer-grained operating
points and achieve comparable to or better performance than the benchmark
methods across 11 datasets and 3 LLMs.

Abstract: As an increasing amount of remote sensing data becomes available in the
Arctic Ocean, data-driven machine learning (ML) techniques are becoming widely
used to predict sea ice velocity (SIV) and sea ice concentration (SIC).
However, fully data-driven ML models have limitations in generalizability and
physical consistency due to their excessive reliance on the quantity and
quality of training data. In particular, as Arctic sea ice entered a new phase
with thinner ice and accelerated melting, there is a possibility that an ML
model trained with historical sea ice data cannot fully represent the
dynamically changing sea ice conditions in the future. In this study, we
develop physics-informed neural network (PINN) strategies to integrate physical
knowledge of sea ice into the ML model. Based on the Hierarchical
Information-sharing U-net (HIS-Unet) architecture, we incorporate the physics
loss function and the activation function to produce physically plausible SIV
and SIC outputs. Our PINN model outperforms the fully data-driven model in the
daily predictions of SIV and SIC, even when trained with a small number of
samples. The PINN approach particularly improves SIC predictions in melting and
early freezing seasons and near fast-moving ice regions.

Abstract: Despite the popularity of the manifold hypothesis, current manifold-learning
methods do not support machine learning directly on the latent $d$-dimensional
data manifold, as they primarily aim to perform dimensionality reduction into
$\mathbb{R}^D$, losing key manifold features when the embedding dimension $D$
approaches $d$.
  On the other hand, methods that directly learn the latent manifold as a
differentiable atlas have been relatively underexplored.
  In this paper, we aim to give a proof of concept of the effectiveness and
potential of atlas-based methods. To this end, we implement a generic data
structure to maintain a differentiable atlas that enables Riemannian
optimization over the manifold. We complement this with an unsupervised
heuristic that learns a differentiable atlas from point cloud data. We
experimentally demonstrate that this approach has advantages in terms of
efficiency and accuracy in selected settings. Moreover, in a supervised
classification task over the Klein bottle and in RNA velocity analysis of
hematopoietic data, we showcase the improved interpretability and robustness of
our approach.

TL;DR: 提出了一个样本级别的框架来衡量后训练过程中的知识遗忘和反向迁移，发现不同后训练阶段对预训练知识的影响各不相同，模型融合不能可靠缓解遗忘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 规模化后训练虽然显著提升语言模型能力，但其对预训练知识的影响尚不明确，需要量化分析知识遗忘和反向迁移的具体模式。

Method: 使用样本级度量方法，统计1->0转换（正确变错误）量化遗忘，0->1转换（错误变正确）量化反向迁移，并针对多选题基准添加机会调整变体。

Result: 分析显示：领域持续预训练导致中度遗忘和低至中度反向迁移；RL/SFT后训练在数学和逻辑任务上产生中至高度反向迁移且总体遗忘较低；指令调优模型上的RL/SFT对数据规模敏感；模型融合不能可靠缓解遗忘。

Conclusion: 该框架为大规模后训练如何改变预训练知识提供了实用衡量标准，有助于开发通用AI系统。

Abstract: Scaled post-training now drives many of the largest capability gains in
language models (LMs), yet its effect on pretrained knowledge remains poorly
understood. Not all forgetting is equal: Forgetting one fact (e.g., a U.S.
president or an API call) does not "average out" by recalling another. Hence,
we propose a sample-wise paradigm to measure what is forgotten and when
backward transfer occurs. Our metric counts 1->0 transitions (correct before
post-training, incorrect after) to quantify forgetting and 0->1 transitions to
quantify backward transfer. Traditional task averages conflate these effects
and obscure large changes. For multiple-choice benchmarks, we add
chance-adjusted variants that subtract the expected contribution of random
guessing from pre- and post-training accuracies. We apply this framework across
post-training stages, model sizes, and data scales. Our large-scale analysis
shows that: (1) Domain-continual pretraining induces moderate forgetting with
low-to-moderate backward transfer; (2) RL/SFT post-training applied to base
models and Instruction tuning yields moderate-to-large backward transfer on
math and logic with overall low-to-moderate forgetting; (3) Applying RL/SFT to
instruction-tuned models is sensitive on data scale: at small scales, both
forgetting and backward transfer are small; at larger scales, effects are mixed
and warrant further study with better controls; (4) Model merging does not
reliably mitigate forgetting. Overall, our framework offers a practical
yardstick for mapping how post-training alters pretrained knowledge at scale --
enabling progress towards generally capable AI systems.

*Adam Stecklov,Noah El Rimawi-Fine,Mathieu Blanchette*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了在推理时保持线性插值的流匹配缩放方法，首次应用于蛋白质生成，证明随着推理计算增加样本质量持续提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 流匹配在语言、视觉和科学领域获得关注，但其推理时缩放方法研究不足，现有方法牺牲了流匹配的高效直线采样特性

Method: 引入新颖的推理时缩放程序，在采样过程中保持线性插值，不替换为非线性方差保持插值

Result: 在图像生成和无条件蛋白质生成任务上评估，样本质量随推理计算增加而持续改善

Conclusion: 流匹配推理时缩放可应用于科学领域，且保持线性插值的方法能有效提升样本质量

Abstract: Allocating extra computation at inference time has recently improved sample
quality in large language models and diffusion-based image generation. In
parallel, Flow Matching (FM) has gained traction in language, vision, and
scientific domains, but inference-time scaling methods for it remain
under-explored. Concurrently, Kim et al., 2025 approach this problem but
replace the linear interpolant with a non-linear variance-preserving (VP)
interpolant at inference, sacrificing FM's efficient and straight sampling.
Additionally, inference-time compute scaling for flow matching has only been
applied to visual tasks, like image generation. We introduce novel
inference-time scaling procedures for FM that preserve the linear interpolant
during sampling. Evaluations of our method on image generation, and for the
first time (to the best of our knowledge), unconditional protein generation,
show that I) sample quality consistently improves as inference compute
increases, and II) flow matching inference-time scaling can be applied to
scientific domains.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现代概率回归器在分布偏移下过度自信的问题，开发能够适应输入变化的预测不确定性估计方法。

Method: 使用输入条件化的网络权重分布，通过beta-ELBO目标函数和蒙特卡洛采样进行训练，诱导产生自适应分散的预测混合分布。

Conclusion: 该框架和评估协议旨在使OOD感知、良好校准的神经回归变得实用和模块化。

Abstract: Modern probabilistic regressors often remain overconfident under distribution
shift. We present Functional Distribution Networks (FDN), an input-conditioned
distribution over network weights that induces predictive mixtures whose
dispersion adapts to the input. FDN is trained with a beta-ELBO and Monte Carlo
sampling. We further propose an evaluation protocol that cleanly separates
interpolation from extrapolation and stresses OOD sanity checks (e.g., that
predictive likelihood degrades under shift while in-distribution accuracy and
calibration are maintained). On standard regression tasks, we benchmark against
strong Bayesian, ensemble, dropout, and hypernetwork baselines under matched
parameter and update budgets, and assess accuracy, calibration, and
shift-awareness with standard diagnostics. Together, the framework and protocol
aim to make OOD-aware, well-calibrated neural regression practical and modular.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有梯度低秩投影方法（如GaLore）缺乏收敛保证，其低秩投影机制会引入偏差，导致与全参数训练存在性能差距。

Method: 基于GaLore机制和Muon算法，采用层间采样技术消除偏差，提出GUM方法。

Conclusion: 该方法通过更均匀的层内知识分布，实现了参数空间的更高效利用和更好的记忆能力。

Abstract: Memory-efficient optimization is critical for training increasingly large
language models (LLMs). A popular strategy involves gradient low-rank
projection, storing only the projected optimizer states, with GaLore being a
representative example. However, a significant drawback of many such methods is
their lack of convergence guarantees, as various low-rank projection approaches
introduce inherent biases relative to the original optimization algorithms,
which contribute to performance gaps compared to full-parameter training.
Aiming to tackle this problem, this paper investigates the layerwise sampling
technique for debiasing low-rank projection mechanisms. In particular, an
instantiation of the paradigm gives rise to a novel and unbiased low-rank
optimization method built upon GaLore's mechanism and the Muon algorithm, named
GaLore Unbiased with Muon (GUM). We theoretically prove our method matches the
convergence guarantees of the base Muon algorithm while preserving the memory
efficiency of low-rank techniques. Empirical experiments on LLM fine-tuning and
pretraining also demonstrate non-trivial improvements over GaLore and even
better performance than full-parameter training. Further investigation shows
that the improvement of this technique comes from a more uniform distribution
of knowledge inside layers, leading to more efficient utilization of the model
parameter space and better memorization.
