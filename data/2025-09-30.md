### [1] [Pathological Truth Bias in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22674)
*Yash Thube*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MATS是一个紧凑的行为审计工具，用于评估视觉语言模型是否拒绝视觉矛盾的陈述，包含空间一致性评分和错误同意率两个指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准基准测试可能掩盖系统性的失败，降低实际应用中的可信度，因此需要更有效的评估方法来发现模型在视觉矛盾情况下的表现问题。

Method: 引入MATS多模态审计工具，通过激活修补技术因果定位失败位置，包括生成模型的中后期交叉注意力和对比模型的池化投影组件。

Result: 指令调优的生成式VLM表现出极低的空间一致性评分和高的错误同意率，而对比编码器模型更加稳健。

Conclusion: 通过定位失败位置，为模型修复提供了具体路径，表明需要改进生成模型在视觉矛盾处理方面的能力。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) are improving quickly, but standard benchmarks
can hide systematic failures that reduce real world trust. We introduce MATS
(Multimodal Audit for Truthful Spatialization), a compact behavioral audit that
measures whether models reject visually contradicted statements, and two
metrics Spatial Consistency Score (SCS) and Incorrect Agreement Rate (IAR).
Instruction tuned generative VLMs (LLaVA 1.5, QwenVLchat) exhibit very low SCS
and high IAR, while contrastive encoders (CLIP, SigLIP) are far more robust.
Activation patching causally localizes failure loci (mid to late cross
attention for generative models, pooled projection components for contrastive
models) and suggests concrete repair paths.

### [2] [Scale and Rotation Estimation of Similarity-Transformed Images via Cross-Correlation Maximization Based on Auxiliary Function Method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22686)
*Shinji Yamashita,Yuma Kinoshita,Hitoshi Kiya*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种高效算法，能够联合估计两幅图像之间的尺度和旋转，达到亚像素精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图像配准在医学成像和计算机视觉中至关重要，但传统相位相关技术无法有效处理尺度和旋转变化，这些变化常由相机缩放或旋转引起。

Method: 基于对数极坐标傅里叶变换，结合交叉相关最大化策略和辅助函数方法，实现亚像素级交叉相关。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在尺度和旋转估计上的平均误差低于传统的基于离散交叉相关的傅里叶变换技术。

Conclusion: 所提出的算法能够精确估计尺度和旋转，优于传统方法。

Abstract: This paper introduces a highly efficient algorithm capable of jointly
estimating scale and rotation between two images with sub-pixel precision.
Image alignment serves as a critical process for spatially registering images
captured from different viewpoints, and finds extensive use in domains such as
medical imaging and computer vision. Traditional phase-correlation techniques
are effective in determining translational shifts; however, they are inadequate
when addressing scale and rotation changes, which often arise due to camera
zooming or rotational movements. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm
that integrates scale and rotation estimation based on the Fourier transform in
log-polar coordinates with a cross-correlation maximization strategy,
leveraging the auxiliary function method. By incorporating sub-pixel-level
cross-correlation our method enables precise estimation of both scale and
rotation. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves
lower mean estimation errors for scale and rotation than conventional Fourier
transform-based techniques that rely on discrete cross-correlation.

### [3] [Robust Object Detection for Autonomous Driving via Curriculum-Guided Group Relative Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22688)
*Xu Jia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于强化学习的框架，通过课程数据调度和难度感知过滤增强GRPO，以解决MLLMs在结构化感知任务中的定位精度和鲁棒性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在视觉语言推理方面表现出色，但在需要精确定位和鲁棒性的结构化感知任务中表现不佳。

Method: 采用强化学习框架，结合课程数据调度和难度感知过滤来增强Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)，在稀疏、噪声奖励下稳定优化过程。

Result: 在自动驾驶基准测试中显示出检测精度和鲁棒性的显著提升，消融研究确认了奖励设计、KL正则化和课程调度对收敛稳定性和泛化能力的重要性。

Conclusion: 强化驱动优化结合结构化数据课程是通往鲁棒和可解释多模态检测的可扩展路径。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel in vision-language reasoning
but often struggle with structured perception tasks requiring precise
localization and robustness. We propose a reinforcement learning framework that
augments Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with curriculum-based data
scheduling and difficulty-aware filtering. This approach stabilizes
optimization under sparse, noisy rewards and enables progressive adaptation to
complex samples. Evaluations on autonomous driving benchmarks demonstrate
substantial improvements in detection accuracy and robustness. Ablation studies
confirm the importance of reward design, KL regularization, and curriculum
pacing for convergence stability and generalization. Our findings highlight
reinforcement-driven optimization with structured data curricula as a scalable
path toward robust and interpretable multimodal detection.

### [4] [Graph-Theoretic Consistency for Robust and Topology-Aware Semi-Supervised Histopathology Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22689)
*Ha-Hieu Pham,Minh Le,Han Huynh,Nguyen Quoc Khanh Le,Huy-Hieu Pham*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出拓扑图一致性(TGC)框架，通过对齐拉普拉斯谱、组件数量和邻接统计来整合图论约束，在半监督语义分割中实现更好的拓扑保持和分割精度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 半监督语义分割在计算病理学中很重要，但现有方法依赖像素级一致性，会传播噪声伪标签并产生碎片化或拓扑无效的掩码

Method: TGC框架通过对齐预测图和参考图之间的拉普拉斯谱、组件数量和邻接统计来强制全局拓扑一致性

Result: 在GlaS和CRAG数据集上，TGC在5-10%监督下达到最先进性能，显著缩小与全监督的差距

Conclusion: TGC通过图论约束有效提升了半监督语义分割的拓扑质量和分割精度

Abstract: Semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SSSS) is vital in computational
pathology, where dense annotations are costly and limited. Existing methods
often rely on pixel-level consistency, which propagates noisy pseudo-labels and
produces fragmented or topologically invalid masks. We propose Topology Graph
Consistency (TGC), a framework that integrates graph-theoretic constraints by
aligning Laplacian spectra, component counts, and adjacency statistics between
prediction graphs and references. This enforces global topology and improves
segmentation accuracy. Experiments on GlaS and CRAG demonstrate that TGC
achieves state-of-the-art performance under 5-10% supervision and significantly
narrows the gap to full supervision. Code is available at
https://github.com/hieuphamha19/TGC.

### [5] [A review of Recent Techniques for Person Re-Identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22690)
*Andrea Asperti,Salvatore Fiorilla,Simone Nardi,Lorenzo Orsini*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文是一篇关于行人重识别（ReID）的综述，重点比较了监督学习和无监督学习方法。监督方法依赖大量标注数据但性能接近饱和，而无监督方法利用未标注数据，近年来性能差距正在缩小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 监督学习方法在行人重识别中取得了显著进展，但依赖大量标注数据，存在可扩展性问题。无监督方法能够利用丰富的未标注数据，近年来显示出有希望的发展，性能差距正在缩小。

Result: 监督学习方法在行人重识别领域已接近性能极限，改进空间有限；无监督方法近年来发展迅速，性能与监督方法的差距正在缩小，显示出收敛趋势。

Conclusion: 行人重识别领域正经历从监督学习向无监督学习的转变，无监督方法具有巨大潜力，未来可能实现与监督方法相当的性能，为实际应用提供更可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Person re-identification (ReId), a crucial task in surveillance, involves
matching individuals across different camera views. The advent of Deep
Learning, especially supervised techniques like Convolutional Neural Networks
and Attention Mechanisms, has significantly enhanced person Re-ID. However, the
success of supervised approaches hinges on vast amounts of annotated data,
posing scalability challenges in data labeling and computational costs. To
address these limitations, recent research has shifted towards unsupervised
person re-identification. Leveraging abundant unlabeled data, unsupervised
methods aim to overcome the need for pairwise labelled data. Although
traditionally trailing behind supervised approaches, unsupervised techniques
have shown promising developments in recent years, signalling a narrowing
performance gap. Motivated by this evolving landscape, our survey pursues two
primary objectives. First, we review and categorize significant publications in
supervised person re-identification, providing an in-depth overview of the
current state-of-the-art and emphasizing little room for further improvement in
this domain. Second, we explore the latest advancements in unsupervised person
re-identification over the past three years, offering insights into emerging
trends and shedding light on the potential convergence of performance between
supervised and unsupervised paradigms. This dual-focus survey aims to
contribute to the evolving narrative of person re-identification, capturing
both the mature landscape of supervised techniques and the promising outcomes
in the realm of unsupervised learning.

### [6] [Sequential Token Merging: Revisiting Hidden States](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22691)
*Yan Wen,Peng Ye,Lin Zhang,Baopu Li,Jiakang Yuan,Yaoxin Yang,Tao Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Sequential Token Merging (STM)方法，通过双向最近邻合并和隐藏状态保护来减少Vision Mambas的token数量，同时保持模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Mambas虽然具有次二次复杂度，但token数量随图像分辨率呈二次增长限制了效率。现有方法忽略了ViMs内在的有限方向序列依赖性(LDSD)这一关键信息流机制。

Method: 1) 双向最近邻合并：通过对称空间聚合保持序列依赖性；2) 隐藏状态保护：稳定类别token周围的隐藏状态。利用Mamba的层间损失收敛将时间遗忘转化为稳定性。

Result: 在20% token减少下ViM-Ti仅下降1.0%准确率，在40%减少下ViM-S仅下降1.4%准确率。实现了最先进的效率且复杂度最小。

Conclusion: STM方法在显著减少token数量的同时保持了模型性能，为状态空间模型动态提供了新的见解。

Abstract: Vision Mambas (ViMs) achieve remarkable success with sub-quadratic
complexity, but their efficiency remains constrained by quadratic token scaling
with image resolution. While existing methods address token redundancy, they
overlook ViMs' intrinsic Limited Directional Sequential Dependence (LDSD) - a
critical information flow mechanism revealed in our analysis. We further
identify Mamba's selective scan enables gradual information aggregation in
hidden states. Based on these insights, we propose Sequential Token Merging
(STM), featuring: 1) Bidirectional nearest neighbor merging to preserve
sequential dependencies through symmetric spatial aggregation, and 2) Hidden
states protection to stabilize the hidden states around the class token. STM
strategically leverages Mamba's layer-wise loss convergence to convert temporal
forgetfulness into stability. Experiments demonstrate STM's superiority: 1.0%
accuracy drop for ViM-Ti at 20% token reduction, and only 1.4% degradation for
ViM-S at 40% reduction. Our method achieves state-of-the-art efficiency with
minimal complexity, while providing new insights into state-space model
dynamics. Codes will be released soon.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大多数超分辨率综述都专注于特定领域，缺乏对该领域的全面概述。本文旨在提供一个深入且全面的综述，涵盖超分辨率的多个子领域。

Method: 对超过150种SISR方法、近70种VSR方法以及约30种SSR和LFSR方法进行了系统分析，包括方法论、数据集、评估协议、经验结果和复杂度分析，并基于不同目的对骨干结构进行了分类。

Abstract: Super-resolution (SR) has garnered significant attention within the computer
vision community, driven by advances in deep learning (DL) techniques and the
growing demand for high-quality visual applications. With the expansion of this
field, numerous surveys have emerged. Most existing surveys focus on specific
domains, lacking a comprehensive overview of this field. Here, we present an
in-depth review of diverse SR methods, encompassing single image
super-resolution (SISR), video super-resolution (VSR), stereo super-resolution
(SSR), and light field super-resolution (LFSR). We extensively cover over 150
SISR methods, nearly 70 VSR approaches, and approximately 30 techniques for SSR
and LFSR. We analyze methodologies, datasets, evaluation protocols, empirical
results, and complexity. In addition, we conducted a taxonomy based on each
backbone structure according to the diverse purposes. We also explore valuable
yet under-studied open issues in the field. We believe that this work will
serve as a valuable resource and offer guidance to researchers in this domain.
To facilitate access to related work, we created a dedicated repository

### [8] [Learning Hyperspectral Images with Curated Text Prompts for Efficient Multimodal Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22697)
*Abhiroop Chatterjee,Susmita Ghosh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于CLIP风格对比训练框架的视觉语言模型，用于高光谱图像场景理解，仅更新0.07%参数就能实现最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着数据需求增长，高效学习越来越依赖于高质量数据的筛选和提炼，而非简单地扩大模型规模。高光谱图像具有高维3D体素结构，其跨模态对齐问题尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 使用CLIP风格的对比训练框架，将视觉主干网络的体素级嵌入映射到冻结的大型嵌入模型潜空间，通过可训练探针对齐视觉特征与文本标记表示。采用包含困难负样本和半困难负样本的对比损失，并引入描述性提示来增强对齐。

Result: 在Indian Pines数据集上比单模态和多模态基线方法提高了0.92%的总体准确率和1.60的Kappa值；在Pavia University数据集上提高了0.69%的总体准确率和0.90的Kappa值。参数数量比DCTN少50倍，比SS-TMNet少90倍。

Conclusion: 该方法通过仅更新极小比例的参数，在高光谱图像场景理解任务中实现了最先进的性能，证明了高效跨模态对齐的有效性。

Abstract: As data requirements continue to grow, efficient learning increasingly
depends on the curation and distillation of high-value data rather than
brute-force scaling of model sizes. In the case of a hyperspectral image (HSI),
the challenge is amplified by the high-dimensional 3D voxel structure, where
each spatial location is associated with hundreds of contiguous spectral
channels. While vision and language models have been optimized effectively for
natural image or text tasks, their cross-modal alignment in the hyperspectral
domain remains an open and underexplored problem. In this article, we make an
attempt to optimize a Vision-Language Model (VLM) for hyperspectral scene
understanding by exploiting a CLIP-style contrastive training framework. Our
framework maps voxel-level embeddings from a vision backbone onto the latent
space of a frozen large embedding model (LEM), where a trainable probe aligns
vision features with the model's textual token representations. The two
modalities are aligned via a contrastive loss restricted to a curated set of
hard (closest wrong classes) and semi-hard (random distractors) negatives,
along with positive pairs. To further enhance alignment, descriptive prompts
that encode class semantics are introduced and act as structured anchors for
the HSI embeddings. It is seen that the proposed method updates only 0.07
percent of the total parameters, yet yields state-of-the-art performance. For
example, on Indian Pines (IP) the model produces better results over unimodal
and multimodal baselines by +0.92 Overall Accuracy (OA) and +1.60 Kappa
($\kappa$), while on Pavia University (PU) data it provides gains of +0.69 OA
and +0.90 $\kappa$. Moreover, this is achieved with the set of parameters,
nearly 50$\times$ smaller than DCTN and 90$\times$ smaller than SS-TMNet.

### [9] [Global Prompt Refinement with Non-Interfering Attention Masking for One-Shot Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22700)
*Zhuang Qi,Pan Yu,Lei Meng,Sijin Zhou,Han Yu,Xiaoxiao Li,Xiangxu Meng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出GPR-NIAM方法，通过注意力隔离和跨设备协作精炼模块实现一次性联邦提示学习，在数据异构环境下提升跨任务泛化能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联邦提示学习方法依赖多轮通信，而一次性联邦学习方法缺乏跨任务泛化能力，需要解决通信效率和泛化性能的平衡问题

Method: 使用注意力隔离模块限制可学习提示嵌入与原始文本嵌入的过度交互，通过跨设备协作精炼模块整合分散的视觉知识并校准全局提示

Result: 在10个基准数据集上的实验表明，GPR-NIAM在类别级和领域级泛化方面优于8种最先进方法

Conclusion: GPR-NIAM通过创新的注意力掩蔽机制成功实现了一次性联邦提示学习，在保持通信效率的同时显著提升了跨任务泛化性能

Abstract: Federated Prompt Learning (FPL) enables communication-efficient adaptation by
tuning lightweight prompts on top of frozen pre-trained models. Existing FPL
methods typically rely on global information, which is only available after the
second training round, to facilitate collaboration among client models.
Therefore, they are inherently dependent on multi-round communication to fully
exhibit their strengths. Moreover, existing one-shot federated learning methods
typically focus on fitting seen tasks, but lack cross-task generalization. To
bridge this gap, we propose the Global Prompt Refinement with Non-Interfering
Attention Masking (GPR-NIAM) method for one-shot FPL. The core idea is to
design a masking mechanism that restricts excessive interaction between the
original text embeddings and the learnable prompt embeddings. GPR-NIAM achieves
this through the collaboration of two key modules. Firstly, the attention
isolation module suppresses attention from the learnable prompt tokens to the
original text tokens, and reweights the reverse attention which preserves
generalization across tasks. Secondly, the cross-silo collaborative refinement
module integrates decentralized visual knowledge into a unified base and
calibrates the global prompt through multi-source cross-modal knowledge
alignment, further mitigating the inconsistency caused by data heterogeneity.
Extensive experiments conducted on ten benchmark datasets under two tasks show
that GPR-NIAM outperforms eight state-of-the-art methods in both class-level
and domain-level generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决3D点云语义分割中缺乏所有对象类别完整训练数据的问题，特别是在人机协作环境中，需要模型能够识别训练时未见的对象类别。

Method: 将专家混合层集成到生成式零样本学习的生成器和判别器中，使用预训练的KPConv模型提取特征，生成与真实特征相似的假特征来训练模型识别未见类别。

Result: GZSL-MoE模型在COVERED数据集上表现出色，能够同时提升对可见和未见类别的分割性能。

Conclusion: 结合生成式零样本学习和专家混合层的GZSL-MoE模型为复杂3D环境理解提供了有前景的解决方案，特别是在缺乏完整训练数据的情况下。

Abstract: Generative Zero-Shot Learning approach (GZSL) has demonstrated significant
potential in 3D point cloud semantic segmentation tasks. GZSL leverages
generative models like GANs or VAEs to synthesize realistic features (real
features) of unseen classes. This allows the model to label unseen classes
during testing, despite being trained only on seen classes. In this context, we
introduce the Generalized Zero-Shot Learning based-upon Mixture-of-Experts
(GZSL-MoE) model. This model incorporates Mixture-of-Experts layers (MoE) to
generate fake features that closely resemble real features extracted using a
pre-trained KPConv (Kernel Point Convolution) model on seen classes. The main
contribution of this paper is the integration of Mixture-of-Experts into the
Generator and Discriminator components of the Generative Zero-Shot Learning
model for 3D point cloud semantic segmentation, applied to the COVERED dataset
(CollabOratiVE Robot Environment Dataset) for Human-Robot Collaboration (HRC)
environments. By combining the Generative Zero-Shot Learning model with
Mixture-of- Experts, GZSL-MoE for 3D point cloud semantic segmentation provides
a promising solution for understanding complex 3D environments, especially when
comprehensive training data for all object classes is unavailable. The
performance evaluation of the GZSL-MoE model highlights its ability to enhance
performance on both seen and unseen classes. Keywords Generalized Zero-Shot

*Adithya Giri*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IBiT通过引入学习掩码为Vision Transformers添加归纳偏置，使其能在小数据集上有效学习，无需知识蒸馏


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer在计算机视觉中占主导地位，但缺乏CNN的归纳偏置，需要大数据集才能学习这些偏置

Method: 通过学习的掩码为Vision Transformers引入归纳偏置

Result: IBiT在小数据集上显著更准确，同时保持Transformer的可解释性

Conclusion: 通过学习的掩码引入归纳偏置，使Vision Transformers能在小数据集上有效工作

Abstract: In recent years, Transformer-based architectures have become the dominant
method for Computer Vision applications. While Transformers are explainable and
scale well with dataset size, they lack the inductive biases of Convolutional
Neural Networks. While these biases may be learned on large datasets, we show
that introducing these inductive biases through learned masks allow Vision
Transformers to learn on much smaller datasets without Knowledge Distillation.
These Transformers, which we call Inductively Biased Image Transformers (IBiT),
are significantly more accurate on small datasets, while retaining the
explainability Transformers.

*Zezhong Fan,Xiaohan Li,Luyi Ma,Kai Zhao,Liang Peng,Topojoy Biswas,Evren Korpeoglu,Kaushiki Nag,Kannan Achan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LayoutAgent是一个结合视觉语言推理与组合扩散的智能框架，用于生成符合语义关系和物理合理性的多目标场景布局。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型缺乏显式空间推理能力，导致对象布局不真实；而传统机器人空间规划方法难以捕捉视觉场景的语义丰富性。

Method: 使用视觉语言模型进行输入预处理（分割、尺寸估计、场景图构建、提示重写），然后利用组合扩散方法合成符合场景图对象关系的边界框，最后通过前景条件图像生成器渲染完整场景。

Result: 实验表明LayoutAgent在布局一致性、空间真实性和美学对齐方面优于其他最先进的布局生成模型。

Conclusion: LayoutAgent成功弥合了视觉生成与空间规划之间的差距，实现了高质量的多目标场景布局生成。

Abstract: Designing realistic multi-object scenes requires not only generating images,
but also planning spatial layouts that respect semantic relations and physical
plausibility. On one hand, while recent advances in diffusion models have
enabled high-quality image generation, they lack explicit spatial reasoning,
leading to unrealistic object layouts. On the other hand, traditional spatial
planning methods in robotics emphasize geometric and relational consistency,
but they struggle to capture semantic richness in visual scenes. To bridge this
gap, in this paper, we propose LayoutAgent, an agentic framework that unifies
vision-language reasoning with compositional diffusion for layout generation.
Given multiple input images with target objects in them, our method first
employs visual-language model to preprocess the inputs through segmentation,
object size estimation, scene graph construction, and prompt rewriting. Then we
leverage compositional diffusion-a method traditionally used in robotics-to
synthesize bounding boxes that respect object relations encoded in the scene
graph for spatial layouts. In the end, a foreground-conditioned image generator
composes the complete scene by rendering the objects into the planned layout
guided by designed prompts. Experiments demonstrate that LayoutAgent
outperforms other state-of-the-art layout generation models in layout
coherence, spatial realism and aesthetic alignment.

*Jie Cai,Kangning Yang,Lan Fu,Jiaming Ding,Jinlong Li,Huiming Sun,Daitao Xing,Jinglin Shen,Zibo Meng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CompareBench是一个评估视觉语言模型视觉比较推理能力的基准，包含1000个QA对，涵盖数量、时间、几何和空间四个任务。评估发现当前最强模型在时间排序和空间关系方面持续失败，在基础计数和几何比较中也经常出错。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉比较推理是视觉语言模型的基本但未被充分研究的技能，需要建立一个专门的基准来系统评估这一能力。

Method: 构建CompareBench基准，包含1000个QA对，分为数量(600)、时间(100)、几何(200)和空间(100)四个任务。基于两个辅助数据集TallyBench(2000张计数图像)和HistCaps(515张历史图像)构建。评估了闭源API(OpenAI、Gemini、Claude)和开源模型(Qwen2.5-VL和Qwen3-VL系列)。

Result: 结果显示明显的扩展趋势，但也揭示了关键限制：即使最强模型在时间排序和空间关系方面持续失败，在基础计数和几何比较中也经常出错，这些对人类来说是微不足道的。

Conclusion: 视觉比较仍然是当前视觉语言模型的系统性盲点。CompareBench通过提供受控、多样和诊断性评估，为推进更可靠的多模态推理奠定了基础。

Abstract: We introduce CompareBench, a benchmark for evaluating visual comparison
reasoning in vision-language models (VLMs), a fundamental yet understudied
skill. CompareBench consists of 1000 QA pairs across four tasks: quantity
(600), temporal (100), geometric (200), and spatial (100). It is derived from
two auxiliary datasets that we constructed: TallyBench (2000 counting images
with QA) and HistCaps (515 historical images with bilingual captions). We
evaluate both closed-source APIs (OpenAI, Gemini, Claude) and open-source
models (Qwen2.5-VL and Qwen3-VL series). Results show clear scaling trends but
also reveal critical limitations: even the strongest models consistently fail
at temporal ordering and spatial relations, and they often make mistakes in
basic counting and geometric comparisons that are trivial for humans. These
findings demonstrate that visual comparison remains a systematic blind spot for
current VLMs. By providing controlled, diverse, and diagnostic evaluation,
CompareBench establishes a foundation for advancing more reliable multimodal
reasoning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MILR是一种在测试时联合推理图像和文本的方法，通过在统一的潜在向量空间中搜索离散标记的向量表示，使用策略梯度方法优化，在多个基准测试中取得最先进的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于推理的图像生成方法要么局限于单一模态（图像或文本），要么依赖高质量推理数据进行微调。为了解决这些限制，需要开发能够在测试时联合推理图像和文本的方法。

Method: 提出MILR方法，在统一的潜在向量空间中联合推理图像和文本，通过策略梯度方法搜索离散图像和文本标记的向量表示，使用图像质量评价器作为指导。该方法在MUG框架中实现，完全在测试时操作。

Result: 在GenEval、T2I-CompBench和WISE基准测试中均取得最先进结果，特别是在知识密集的WISE上获得0.63的总体分数，比基线提高80%。定性研究显示MILR在时间和文化推理方面具有显著能力。

Conclusion: 在统一潜在空间中的联合推理是MILR强大性能的关键，该方法展示了有效的跨模态推理能力，无需依赖高质量推理数据进行微调。

Abstract: Reasoning-augmented machine learning systems have shown improved performance
in various domains, including image generation. However, existing
reasoning-based methods for image generation either restrict reasoning to a
single modality (image or text) or rely on high-quality reasoning data for
fine-tuning. To tackle these limitations, we propose MILR, a test-time method
that jointly reasons over image and text in a unified latent vector space.
Reasoning in MILR is performed by searching through vector representations of
discrete image and text tokens. Practically, this is implemented via the policy
gradient method, guided by an image quality critic. We instantiate MILR within
the unified multimodal understanding and generation (MUG) framework that
natively supports language reasoning before image synthesis and thus
facilitates cross-modal reasoning. The intermediate model outputs, which are to
be optimized, serve as the unified latent space, enabling MILR to operate
entirely at test time. We evaluate MILR on GenEval, T2I-CompBench, and WISE,
achieving state-of-the-art results on all benchmarks. Notably, on
knowledge-intensive WISE, MILR attains an overall score of 0.63, improving over
the baseline by 80%. Our further analysis indicates that joint reasoning in the
unified latent space is the key to its strong performance. Moreover, our
qualitative studies reveal MILR's non-trivial ability in temporal and cultural
reasoning, highlighting the efficacy of our reasoning method.

*Tangqi Shi,Pietro Lio*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出UESA-Net网络，通过多向收缩注意力机制解决超声图像分割中全局上下文与局部细节的语义鸿沟问题，在甲状腺和乳腺超声图像分割任务上取得SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超声图像分割面临斑点噪声、结构重叠和全局-局部特征交互弱的问题，现有网络难以平衡高级语义与低级空间细节，需要开发能够弥合全局上下文与局部细节语义鸿沟的分割框架。

Method: 提出U形网络UESA-Net，采用多向收缩注意力机制。编码器-解码器架构捕获病灶的长程依赖和细粒度结构，编码块中注意力模块沿水平、垂直和深度方向操作以利用空间细节，收缩策略整合先验知识和局部特征。解码器应用成对收缩机制，结合先验低级物理线索与编码器特征增强上下文建模。

Result: 在TN3K（3493张图像）和BUSI（780张图像）两个公共数据集上，UESA-Net分别实现了0.8487和0.6495的IoU分数，达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: UESA-Net通过有效聚合多向空间信息和先验知识，提高了乳腺和甲状腺超声分割的鲁棒性和准确性，在多个基准测试中表现出优于现有方法的性能。

Abstract: Background: Breast and thyroid cancers pose an increasing public-health
burden. Ultrasound imaging is a cost-effective, real-time modality for lesion
detection and segmentation, yet suffers from speckle noise, overlapping
structures, and weak global-local feature interactions. Existing networks
struggle to reconcile high-level semantics with low-level spatial details. We
aim to develop a segmentation framework that bridges the semantic gap between
global context and local detail in noisy ultrasound images.
  Methods: We propose UESA-Net, a U-shaped network with multidirectional
shrinkage attention. The encoder-decoder architecture captures long-range
dependencies and fine-grained structures of lesions. Within each encoding
block, attention modules operate along horizontal, vertical, and depth
directions to exploit spatial details, while a shrinkage (threshold) strategy
integrates prior knowledge and local features. The decoder mirrors the encoder
but applies a pairwise shrinkage mechanism, combining prior low-level physical
cues with corresponding encoder features to enhance context modeling.
  Results: On two public datasets - TN3K (3493 images) and BUSI (780 images) -
UESA-Net achieved state-of-the-art performance with intersection-over-union
(IoU) scores of 0.8487 and 0.6495, respectively.
  Conclusions: UESA-Net effectively aggregates multidirectional spatial
information and prior knowledge to improve robustness and accuracy in breast
and thyroid ultrasound segmentation, demonstrating superior performance to
existing methods on multiple benchmarks.

*Fernando Julio Cendra,Kai Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PartCo是一个新的广义类别发现框架，通过引入部件级视觉特征对应关系来增强类别发现能力，能够无缝集成到现有GCD方法中并显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GCD方法主要依赖语义标签和全局图像表示，忽略了对于区分相近类别至关重要的部件级线索。

Method: 提出PartCo框架，利用部件级关系捕捉更细粒度的语义结构，从而更细致地理解类别关系。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，PartCo显著提升了当前GCD方法的性能，达到了最先进的结果。

Conclusion: PartCo通过弥合语义标签与部件级视觉组合之间的差距，为GCD设定了新的基准。

Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) aims to identify both known and novel
categories within unlabeled data by leveraging a set of labeled examples from
known categories. Existing GCD methods primarily depend on semantic labels and
global image representations, often overlooking the detailed part-level cues
that are crucial for distinguishing closely related categories. In this paper,
we introduce PartCo, short for Part-Level Correspondence Prior, a novel
framework that enhances category discovery by incorporating part-level visual
feature correspondences. By leveraging part-level relationships, PartCo
captures finer-grained semantic structures, enabling a more nuanced
understanding of category relationships. Importantly, PartCo seamlessly
integrates with existing GCD methods without requiring significant
modifications. Our extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets
demonstrate that PartCo significantly improves the performance of current GCD
approaches, achieving state-of-the-art results by bridging the gap between
semantic labels and part-level visual compositions, thereby setting new
benchmarks for GCD. Project page: https://visual-ai.github.io/partco

TL;DR: DEFT是一种分解式高效微调框架，通过将预训练权重矩阵的更新分解为两个可训练矩阵组件，在保持编辑能力的同时实现个性化学习和多任务统一。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决文本到图像模型高效微调中在目标分布对齐、从有限图像学习新概念、保持指令能力以及维持编辑性之间的平衡挑战。

Method: 将预训练权重矩阵更新分解为两个组件：在低秩子空间补集上的投影和低秩更新，使用两个可训练低秩矩阵分别定义子空间和实现参数适配。

Result: 在Dreambooth、Dreambench Plus、InsDet和VisualCloze数据集上的实验显示，DEFT在个性化、对象场景适配和视觉上下文学习方面达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: DEFT框架展示了高效微调的新兴特性，在保持模型编辑能力的同时实现了优异的性能表现。

Abstract: Efficient fine-tuning of pre-trained Text-to-Image (T2I) models involves
adjusting the model to suit a particular task or dataset while minimizing
computational resources and limiting the number of trainable parameters.
However, it often faces challenges in striking a trade-off between aligning
with the target distribution: learning a novel concept from a limited image for
personalization and retaining the instruction ability needed for unifying
multiple tasks, all while maintaining editability (aligning with a variety of
prompts or in-context generation). In this work, we introduce DEFT,
Decompositional Efficient Fine-Tuning, an efficient fine-tuning framework that
adapts a pre-trained weight matrix by decomposing its update into two
components with two trainable matrices: (1) a projection onto the complement of
a low-rank subspace spanned by a low-rank matrix, and (2) a low-rank update.
The single trainable low-rank matrix defines the subspace, while the other
trainable low-rank matrix enables flexible parameter adaptation within that
subspace. We conducted extensive experiments on the Dreambooth and Dreambench
Plus datasets for personalization, the InsDet dataset for object and scene
adaptation, and the VisualCloze dataset for a universal image generation
framework through visual in-context learning with both Stable Diffusion and a
unified model. Our results demonstrated state-of-the-art performance,
highlighting the emergent properties of efficient fine-tuning. Our code is

TL;DR: VideoScore2是一个多维、可解释且与人类对齐的视频评估框架，能够评估视觉质量、文本-视频对齐和物理/常识一致性，并提供详细的推理过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视频评估方法仅限于单一不透明分数，缺乏可解释性，或仅提供粗略分析，无法全面评估视频质量的多方面特性。

Method: 使用包含27,168个人工标注视频的大规模数据集VideoFeedback2，采用两阶段训练流程：监督微调后使用GRPO进行强化学习，以增强分析鲁棒性。

Result: 在VideoScore-Bench-v2基准测试中达到44.35准确率（提升5.94），在四个外部基准测试中平均性能达50.37（提升4.32）。

Conclusion: VideoScore2提供了可解释的评估，通过有效的奖励建模为可控生成搭建桥梁，支持Best-of-N采样。

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-video generation have produced increasingly
realistic and diverse content, yet evaluating such videos remains a fundamental
challenge due to their multi-faceted nature encompassing visual quality,
semantic alignment, and physical consistency. Existing evaluators and reward
models are limited to single opaque scores, lack interpretability, or provide
only coarse analysis, making them insufficient for capturing the comprehensive
nature of video quality assessment. We present VideoScore2, a
multi-dimensional, interpretable, and human-aligned framework that explicitly
evaluates visual quality, text-to-video alignment, and physical/common-sense
consistency while producing detailed chain-of-thought rationales. Our model is
trained on a large-scale dataset VideoFeedback2 containing 27,168
human-annotated videos with both scores and reasoning traces across three
dimensions, using a two-stage pipeline of supervised fine-tuning followed by
reinforcement learning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to
enhance analytical robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
VideoScore2 achieves superior performance with 44.35 (+5.94) accuracy on our
in-domain benchmark VideoScore-Bench-v2 and 50.37 (+4.32) average performance
across four out-of-domain benchmarks (VideoGenReward-Bench, VideoPhy2, etc),
while providing interpretable assessments that bridge the gap between
evaluation and controllable generation through effective reward modeling for
Best-of-N sampling. Project Page: https://tiger-ai-lab.github.io/VideoScore2/

TL;DR: TRUST是一种针对状态空间模型(SSMs)的测试时自适应方法，通过利用多种遍历排列生成输入图像的多个因果视角，使用模型预测作为伪标签来指导Mamba特定参数的更新，从而提高模型在分布偏移下的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 状态空间模型(SSMs)作为视觉Transformer(ViTs)的高效替代方案，在分布偏移下泛化性能显著下降，需要专门的自适应方法来提升其鲁棒性。

Method: 提出TRUST方法，利用多样化的遍历排列生成多个因果视角，使用模型预测作为伪标签更新Mamba特定参数，并通过权重平均整合不同遍历扫描中学到的信息。

Result: 在七个基准测试上的实验表明，TRUST持续提升鲁棒性，并优于现有的测试时自适应方法。

Conclusion: TRUST是首个明确利用SSMs独特架构特性进行自适应的创新方法，为状态空间模型在分布偏移场景下的应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs) have emerged as efficient alternatives to Vision
Transformers (ViTs), with VMamba standing out as a pioneering architecture
designed for vision tasks. However, their generalization performance degrades
significantly under distribution shifts. To address this limitation, we propose
TRUST (Test-Time Refinement using Uncertainty-Guided SSM Traverses), a novel
test-time adaptation (TTA) method that leverages diverse traversal permutations
to generate multiple causal perspectives of the input image. Model predictions
serve as pseudo-labels to guide updates of the Mamba-specific parameters, and
the adapted weights are averaged to integrate the learned information across
traversal scans. Altogether, TRUST is the first approach that explicitly
leverages the unique architectural properties of SSMs for adaptation.
Experiments on seven benchmarks show that TRUST consistently improves
robustness and outperforms existing TTA methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MMPB是首个用于评估视觉语言模型个性化能力的大规模基准，包含10k图像-查询对和111个可个性化概念，涵盖人类、动物、物体和角色四个类别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉个性化在面向用户的AI系统中至关重要，但现有大型视觉语言模型在适应个体用户方面的能力尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 构建包含10k图像-查询对的MMPB基准，将个性化分为三种任务类型，使用23个广泛使用的VLM模型通过三阶段协议进行评估：概念注入、多轮对话和个性化查询。

Result: 大多数VLM在个性化方面表现不佳，特别是在保持对话一致性、处理用户偏好和适应视觉线索方面存在困难。

Conclusion: MMPB通过识别VLM个性化的局限性并提供一个可扩展的基准，为未来实现真正个性化的多模态AI研究提供了宝贵见解和坚实基础。

Abstract: Visual personalization is essential in user-facing AI systems such as smart
homes and healthcare, where aligning model behavior with user-centric concepts
is critical. However, recent large Vision-Language Models (VLMs), despite their
broad applicability, remain underexplored in their ability to adapt to
individual users. In this paper, we introduce MMPB, the first extensive
benchmark for evaluating VLMs on personalization. MMPB comprises 10k
image-query pairs and includes 111 personalizable concepts across four
categories: humans, animals, objects, and characters, with the human category
enriched with preference-grounded queries. We structure personalization into
three main task types, each highlighting a different key property of VLMs.
Using 23 widely used VLMs including both open- and closed-source models, we
evaluate personalization performance via a three-stage protocol: concept
injection, multi-turn dialogue, and personalized querying. Our findings
indicate that most VLMs (including some closed-source models) struggle with
personalization, particularly in maintaining consistency over dialogue,
handling user preferences, and adapting to visual cues. Our analysis reveals
that the challenges in VLM personalization (such as refusal behaviors and
long-context forgetting) highlight substantial room for improvement. By
identifying these limitations and offering a scalable benchmark, MMPB offers
valuable insights and a solid foundation for future research toward truly
personalized multi-modal AI. Project Page: aidaslab.github.io/MMPB

*Roie Kazoom,Alon Goldberg,Hodaya Cohen,Ofer Hadar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种完全可控的对抗性补丁生成框架，允许攻击者自由选择输入图像和目标类别，实现精确的错误分类控制。该方法结合生成式U-Net设计和Grad-CAM引导的补丁放置，在保持视觉真实性的同时最大化攻击效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗性补丁攻击方法存在三个主要问题：依赖不切实际的白盒假设、使用非目标攻击目标、生成视觉上明显的补丁，这些都限制了实际应用。需要开发一种同时确保真实性、目标控制和黑盒适用性的方法。

Method: 结合生成式U-Net架构和Grad-CAM引导的补丁放置策略，实现语义感知的定位，在保持视觉真实性的同时最大化攻击效果。

Result: 在卷积网络（DenseNet-121, ResNet-50）和视觉变换器（ViT-B/16, Swin-B/16等）上的广泛实验表明，该方法在所有设置下都达到了最先进的性能，攻击成功率（ASR）和目标类成功率（TCS）均超过99%。

Conclusion: 该框架在对抗性补丁攻击的三个最具挑战性的维度——真实性、目标控制和黑盒适用性上同时取得突破，为对抗性鲁棒性研究设立了新的基准，弥合了理论攻击强度与实际隐蔽性之间的差距。

Abstract: Adversarial patch attacks pose a severe threat to deep neural networks, yet
most existing approaches rely on unrealistic white-box assumptions, untargeted
objectives, or produce visually conspicuous patches that limit real-world
applicability. In this work, we introduce a novel framework for fully
controllable adversarial patch generation, where the attacker can freely choose
both the input image x and the target class y target, thereby dictating the
exact misclassification outcome. Our method combines a generative U-Net design
with Grad-CAM-guided patch placement, enabling semantic-aware localization that
maximizes attack effectiveness while preserving visual realism. Extensive
experiments across convolutional networks (DenseNet-121, ResNet-50) and vision
transformers (ViT-B/16, Swin-B/16, among others) demonstrate that our approach
achieves state-of-the-art performance across all settings, with attack success
rates (ASR) and target-class success (TCS) consistently exceeding 99%.
  Importantly, we show that our method not only outperforms prior white-box
attacks and untargeted baselines, but also surpasses existing non-realistic
approaches that produce detectable artifacts. By simultaneously ensuring
realism, targeted control, and black-box applicability-the three most
challenging dimensions of patch-based attacks-our framework establishes a new
benchmark for adversarial robustness research, bridging the gap between
theoretical attack strength and practical stealthiness.

TL;DR: CrossScaleNet是一种结合跨注意力机制和多尺度处理的时间序列预测架构，在保持高性能的同时提供更好的时间可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的时间显著性检测方法计算成本高，现有声称可解释的模型往往在标准基准测试中性能不佳，需要一种既能有效捕捉时间显著性又能保持预测性能的平衡方法。

Method: 使用基于补丁的跨注意力机制与多尺度处理相结合，将注意力机制嵌入训练过程，提供内在的时间可解释性。

Result: 在合成数据集和公共基准测试中验证了方法的鲁棒性，在真实世界预测任务中表现优于大多数基于Transformer的模型，在时间显著性检测和预测准确性方面均表现出色。

Conclusion: CrossScaleNet填补了现有模型的空白，提供了一种平衡的方法，在捕捉时间显著性的同时提供最先进的预测性能，适用于不同复杂度的数据集。

Abstract: Explainability in time series forecasting is essential for improving model
transparency and supporting informed decision-making. In this work, we present
CrossScaleNet, an innovative architecture that combines a patch-based
cross-attention mechanism with multi-scale processing to achieve both high
performance and enhanced temporal explainability. By embedding attention
mechanisms into the training process, our model provides intrinsic
explainability for temporal saliency, making its decision-making process more
transparent. Traditional post-hoc methods for temporal saliency detection are
computationally expensive, particularly when compared to feature importance
detection. While ablation techniques may suffice for datasets with fewer
features, identifying temporal saliency poses greater challenges due to its
complexity. We validate CrossScaleNet on synthetic datasets with known saliency
ground truth and on established public benchmarks, demonstrating the robustness
of our method in identifying temporal saliency. Experiments on real-world
datasets for forecasting task show that our approach consistently outperforms
most transformer-based models, offering better explainability without
sacrificing predictive accuracy. Our evaluations demonstrate superior
performance in both temporal saliency detection and forecasting accuracy.
Moreover, we highlight that existing models claiming explainability often fail
to maintain strong performance on standard benchmarks. CrossScaleNet addresses
this gap, offering a balanced approach that captures temporal saliency
effectively while delivering state-of-the-art forecasting performance across
datasets of varying complexity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 肺癌是全球癌症相关死亡的主要原因，准确分割PET/CT成像中的内部肿瘤体积(IGTV)对移动肿瘤的放射治疗至关重要，但受到标注IGTV数据集有限和肿瘤边界PET信号强度衰减的阻碍。

Method: 使用预训练在大规模肿瘤体积(GTV)数据集上的多模态交互感知网络MAMBA，在私有IGTV数据集上进行微调；引入切片交互模块(SIM)在2.5D分割框架中建模切片间关系，集成通道和空间注意力分支与深度卷积。

Result: 在私有IGTV数据集上达到Dice系数0.609，显著超过传统基线方法的0.385。

Conclusion: 这项工作展示了迁移学习结合先进多模态技术和SIM模块在提高IGTV分割可靠性和临床相关性方面的潜力，对肺癌放射治疗规划具有重要意义。

Abstract: Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancerrelated deaths globally.
Accurate delineation of internal gross tumor volume (IGTV) in PET/CT imaging is
pivotal for optimal radiation therapy in mobile tumors such as lung cancer to
account for tumor motion, yet is hindered by the limited availability of
annotated IGTV datasets and attenuated PET signal intensity at tumor
boundaries. In this study, we present a transfer learningbased methodology
utilizing a multimodal interactive perception network with MAMBA, pre-trained
on extensive gross tumor volume (GTV) datasets and subsequently fine-tuned on a
private IGTV cohort. This cohort constitutes the PET/CT subset of the
Lung-cancer Unified Cross-modal Imaging Dataset (LUCID). To further address the
challenge of weak PET intensities in IGTV peripheral slices, we introduce a
slice interaction module (SIM) within a 2.5D segmentation framework to
effectively model inter-slice relationships. Our proposed module integrates
channel and spatial attention branches with depthwise convolutions, enabling
more robust learning of slice-to-slice dependencies and thereby improving
overall segmentation performance. A comprehensive experimental evaluation
demonstrates that our approach achieves a Dice of 0.609 on the private IGTV
dataset, substantially surpassing the conventional baseline score of 0.385.
This work highlights the potential of transfer learning, coupled with advanced
multimodal techniques and a SIM to enhance the reliability and clinical
relevance of IGTV segmentation for lung cancer radiation therapy planning.

Abstract: In recent years, event cameras have gained significant attention due to their
bio-inspired properties, such as high temporal resolution and high dynamic
range. However, obtaining large-scale labeled ground-truth data for event-based
vision tasks remains challenging and costly. In this paper, we present
ControlEvents, a diffusion-based generative model designed to synthesize
high-quality event data guided by diverse control signals such as class text
labels, 2D skeletons, and 3D body poses. Our key insight is to leverage the
diffusion prior from foundation models, such as Stable Diffusion, enabling
high-quality event data generation with minimal fine-tuning and limited labeled
data. Our method streamlines the data generation process and significantly
reduces the cost of producing labeled event datasets. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach by synthesizing event data for visual
recognition, 2D skeleton estimation, and 3D body pose estimation. Our
experiments show that the synthesized labeled event data enhances model
performance in all tasks. Additionally, our approach can generate events based
on unseen text labels during training, illustrating the powerful text-based
generation capabilities inherited from foundation models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统学习型方法需要大量训练数据和经典迭代方法精度优势之间的矛盾，同时克服隐式神经表示方法计算效率低和学习稳定性差的问题。

Method: 将Kolmogorov-Arnold网络与隐式神经表示相结合，提出随机基采样策略减少基函数数量，降低计算复杂度。

Result: 在肺CT、脑MRI和心脏MRI三个数据集上，KAN-IDIR和RandKAN-IDIR在INR方法中达到最高精度，计算开销最小，学习稳定性最佳，且RandKAN-IDIR略优于可学习基函数索引版本。

Conclusion: KAN与INR的结合为医学图像配准提供了高效稳定的解决方案，随机基采样策略在保持性能的同时显著降低了计算成本。

Abstract: Deformable image registration (DIR) is a cornerstone of medical image
analysis, enabling spatial alignment for tasks like comparative studies and
multi-modal fusion. While learning-based methods (e.g., CNNs, transformers)
offer fast inference, they often require large training datasets and struggle
to match the precision of classical iterative approaches on some organ types
and imaging modalities. Implicit neural representations (INRs) have emerged as
a promising alternative, parameterizing deformations as continuous mappings
from coordinates to displacement vectors. However, this comes at the cost of
requiring instance-specific optimization, making computational efficiency and
seed-dependent learning stability critical factors for these methods. In this
work, we propose KAN-IDIR and RandKAN-IDIR, the first integration of
Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) into deformable image registration with
implicit neural representations (INRs). Our proposed randomized basis sampling
strategy reduces the required number of basis functions in KAN while
maintaining registration quality, thereby significantly lowering computational
costs. We evaluated our approach on three diverse datasets (lung CT, brain MRI,
cardiac MRI) and compared it with competing instance-specific learning-based
approaches, dataset-trained deep learning models, and classical registration
approaches. KAN-IDIR and RandKAN-IDIR achieved the highest accuracy among
INR-based methods across all evaluated modalities and anatomies, with minimal
computational overhead and superior learning stability across multiple random
seeds. Additionally, we discovered that our RandKAN-IDIR model with randomized
basis sampling slightly outperforms the model with learnable basis function
indices, while eliminating its additional training-time complexity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有集合输入网络(如Deep Sets和Set Transformer)只能处理向量输入，无法直接处理3D图像张量，必须与CNN特征提取器级联，限制了性能。

Method: CST直接在3D图像张量上操作，同时执行特征提取和上下文建模，支持CNN可解释性方法如Grad-CAM，并可通过迁移学习适应新任务。

Result: 在集合分类和集合异常检测任务中表现优于现有方法，提供了更好的可解释性，并发布了在ImageNet上预训练的CST-15骨干网络。

Conclusion: CST是首个能够直接处理3D图像张量的集合输入网络架构，实现了特征提取和上下文建模的协同作用，为集合视觉任务提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce the Convolutional Set Transformer (CST), a novel neural
architecture designed to process image sets of arbitrary cardinality that are
visually heterogeneous yet share high-level semantics - such as a common
category, scene, or concept. Existing set-input networks, e.g., Deep Sets and
Set Transformer, are limited to vector inputs and cannot directly handle 3D
image tensors. As a result, they must be cascaded with a feature extractor,
typically a CNN, which encodes images into embeddings before the set-input
network can model inter-image relationships. In contrast, CST operates directly
on 3D image tensors, performing feature extraction and contextual modeling
simultaneously, thereby enabling synergies between the two processes. This
design yields superior performance in tasks such as Set Classification and Set
Anomaly Detection and further provides native compatibility with CNN
explainability methods such as Grad-CAM, unlike competing approaches that
remain opaque. Finally, we show that CSTs can be pre-trained on large-scale
datasets and subsequently adapted to new domains and tasks through standard
Transfer Learning schemes. To support further research, we release CST-15, a
CST backbone pre-trained on ImageNet
(https://github.com/chinefed/convolutional-set-transformer).

from low saliency, and (4) high computational costs. To address these issues,
we propose TY-RIST, an optimized YOLOv12n architecture that integrates (1) a
stride-aware backbone with fine-grained receptive fields, (2) a high-resolution
detection head, (3) cascaded coordinate attention blocks, and (4) a branch
pruning strategy that reduces computational cost by about 25.5% while
marginally improving accuracy and enabling real-time inference. We also
incorporate the Normalized Gaussian Wasserstein Distance (NWD) to enhance
regression stability. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks and across 20
different models demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, improving mAP at 0.5
IoU by +7.9%, Precision by +3%, and Recall by +10.2%, while achieving up to 123
FPS on a single GPU. Cross-dataset validation on a fifth dataset further
confirms strong generalization capability. Additional results and resources are

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯泼溅的参数化表示具有非唯一性和异构性，直接作为神经网络输入会导致高度数据依赖的模型，需要更原则性的表示方法。

Method: 基于连续子流形场构建嵌入表示，封装高斯基元的本质信息，保持颜色和几何结构，同时强制唯一映射和通道同质性。

Result: 该方法能够更好地表示3D高斯泼溅，有利于3DGS的学习。

Conclusion: 提出的连续子流形场嵌入表示为3D高斯泼溅在神经网络中的应用提供了更有效的特征表示方案。

Abstract: A well-designed vectorized representation is crucial for the learning systems
natively based on 3D Gaussian Splatting. While 3DGS enables efficient and
explicit 3D reconstruction, its parameter-based representation remains hard to
learn as features, especially for neural-network-based models. Directly feeding
raw Gaussian parameters into learning frameworks fails to address the
non-unique and heterogeneous nature of the Gaussian parameterization, yielding
highly data-dependent models. This challenge motivates us to explore a more
principled approach to represent 3D Gaussian Splatting in neural networks that
preserves the underlying color and geometric structure while enforcing unique
mapping and channel homogeneity. In this paper, we propose an embedding
representation of 3DGS based on continuous submanifold fields that encapsulate
the intrinsic information of Gaussian primitives, thereby benefiting the
learning of 3DGS.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了soft embeddings方法，将一步生成器的离散token输出替换为基于输出分布的期望嵌入，使模型完全可微分，支持GAN精炼、奖励微调和测试时嵌入优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决一步生成器的两个关键限制：继承教师模型的建模偏差，以及离散token输出阻断梯度流，无法进行后蒸馏优化。

Method: 引入soft embeddings，用生成器输出分布的期望嵌入替代离散token，保持表示保真度的同时提供完全可微分的连续替代，与教师主干和tokenizer解码器兼容。

Result: 在多个MDM教师模型上，Soft-Di[M]O实现最先进的一步生成结果：改进的类别到图像性能，在ImageNet-256上通过GAN精炼达到1.56的FID，文本到图像任务上获得更高的GenEval和HPS分数，并通过TTEO获得进一步增益。

Conclusion: soft embeddings使一步生成器端到端可训练，支持多种优化技术，显著提升生成质量。

Abstract: One-step generators distilled from Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs) compress
multiple sampling steps into a single forward pass, enabling efficient text and
image synthesis. However, they suffer two key limitations: they inherit
modeling bias from the teacher, and their discrete token outputs block gradient
flow, preventing post-distillation refinements such as adversarial training,
reward-based fine-tuning, and Test-Time Embedding Optimization (TTEO). In this
work, we introduce soft embeddings, a simple relaxation that replaces discrete
tokens with the expected embeddings under the generator's output distribution.
Soft embeddings preserve representation fidelity for one-step discrete
generator while providing a fully differentiable continuous surrogate that is
compatible with teacher backbones and tokenizer decoders. Integrating soft
embeddings into the Di[M]O distillation framework (denoted Soft-Di[M]O) makes
one-step generators end-to-end trainable and enables straightforward
application of GAN-based refinement, differentiable reward fine-tuning, and
TTEO. Empirically, across multiple MDM teachers (e.g., MaskBit, MaskGen),
Soft-Di[M]O achieves state-of-the-art one-step results: improved class-to-image
performance, a one-step FID of 1.56 on ImageNet-256 with GAN-based refinement,
along with higher GenEval and HPS scores on text-to-image with reward
fine-tuning, and further gains from TTEO.

Abstract: Traditional marine biological image recognition faces challenges of
incomplete datasets and unsatisfactory model accuracy, particularly for
few-shot conditions of rare species where data scarcity significantly hampers
the performance. To address these issues, this study proposes an intelligent
marine fish recognition framework, FishAI 2.0, integrating multimodal few-shot
deep learning techniques with image generation for data augmentation. First, a
hierarchical marine fish benchmark dataset, which provides a comprehensive data
foundation for subsequent model training, is utilized to train the FishAI 2.0
model. To address the data scarcity of rare classes, the large language model
DeepSeek was employed to generate high-quality textual descriptions, which are
input into Stable Diffusion 2 for image augmentation through a hierarchical
diffusion strategy that extracts latent encoding to construct a multimodal
feature space. The enhanced visual-textual datasets were then fed into a
Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) based model, enabling robust
few-shot image recognition. Experimental results demonstrate that FishAI 2.0
achieves a Top-1 accuracy of 91.67 percent and Top-5 accuracy of 97.97 percent
at the family level, outperforming baseline CLIP and ViT models with a
substantial margin for the minority classes with fewer than 10 training
samples. To better apply FishAI 2.0 to real-world scenarios, at the genus and
species level, FishAI 2.0 respectively achieves a Top-1 accuracy of 87.58
percent and 85.42 percent, demonstrating practical utility. In summary, FishAI
2.0 improves the efficiency and accuracy of marine fish identification and
provides a scalable technical solution for marine ecological monitoring and
conservation, highlighting its scientific value and practical applicability.

Abstract: Brain tumors are abnormal cell growths in the central nervous system (CNS),
and their timely detection is critical for improving patient outcomes. This
paper proposes an automatic and efficient deep-learning framework for brain
tumor detection from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. The framework
employs a pre-trained ResNet50 model for feature extraction, followed by Global
Average Pooling (GAP) and linear projection to obtain compact, high-level image
representations. These features are then processed by a novel Dense-Dropout
sequence, a core contribution of this work, which enhances non-linear feature
learning, reduces overfitting, and improves robustness through diverse feature
transformations. Another major contribution is the creation of the Mymensingh
Medical College Brain Tumor (MMCBT) dataset, designed to address the lack of
reliable brain tumor MRI resources. The dataset comprises MRI scans from 209
subjects (ages 9 to 65), including 3671 tumor and 13273 non-tumor images, all
clinically verified under expert supervision. To overcome class imbalance, the
tumor class was augmented, resulting in a balanced dataset well-suited for deep
learning research.

Motivation: 解决颅内出血CT诊断中AI开发因公共数据碎片化而受阻的问题，提供统一、细粒度的标注数据集。

Method: 收集2012-2024年的372个头部CT检查，采用双读工作流程进行五种出血亚型的详尽标注，包括分类标签、边界框、像素和体素掩码。

Abstract: Timely diagnosis of Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) on Computed Tomography (CT)
scans remains a clinical priority, yet the development of robust Artificial
Intelligence (AI) solutions is still hindered by fragmented public data. To
close this gap, we introduce Hemorica, a publicly available collection of 372
head CT examinations acquired between 2012 and 2024. Each scan has been
exhaustively annotated for five ICH subtypes-epidural (EPH), subdural (SDH),
subarachnoid (SAH), intraparenchymal (IPH), and intraventricular (IVH)-yielding
patient-wise and slice-wise classification labels, subtype-specific bounding
boxes, two-dimensional pixel masks and three-dimensional voxel masks. A
double-reading workflow, preceded by a pilot consensus phase and supported by
neurosurgeon adjudication, maintained low inter-rater variability.
Comprehensive statistical analysis confirms the clinical realism of the
dataset. To establish reference baselines, standard convolutional and
transformer architectures were fine-tuned for binary slice classification and
hemorrhage segmentation. With only minimal fine-tuning, lightweight models such
as MobileViT-XS achieved an F1 score of 87.8% in binary classification, whereas
a U-Net with a DenseNet161 encoder reached a Dice score of 85.5% for binary
lesion segmentation that validate both the quality of the annotations and the
sufficiency of the sample size. Hemorica therefore offers a unified,
fine-grained benchmark that supports multi-task and curriculum learning,
facilitates transfer to larger but weakly labelled cohorts, and facilitates the
process of designing an AI-based assistant for ICH detection and quantification
systems.

Conclusion: ARSS框架证明了自回归模型在视图合成任务中的有效性，为世界建模提供了一种新的解决方案。

Abstract: Despite their exceptional generative quality, diffusion models have limited
applicability to world modeling tasks, such as novel view generation from
sparse inputs. This limitation arises because diffusion models generate outputs
in a non-causal manner, often leading to distortions or inconsistencies across
views, and making it difficult to incrementally adapt accumulated knowledge to
new queries. In contrast, autoregressive (AR) models operate in a causal
fashion, generating each token based on all previously generated tokens. In
this work, we introduce \textbf{ARSS}, a novel framework that leverages a
GPT-style decoder-only AR model to generate novel views from a single image,
conditioned on a predefined camera trajectory. We employ a video tokenizer to
map continuous image sequences into discrete tokens and propose a camera
encoder that converts camera trajectories into 3D positional guidance. Then to
enhance generation quality while preserving the autoregressive structure, we
propose a autoregressive transformer module that randomly permutes the spatial
order of tokens while maintaining their temporal order. Extensive qualitative
and quantitative experiments on public datasets demonstrate that our method
performs comparably to, or better than, state-of-the-art view synthesis
approaches based on diffusion models. Our code will be released upon paper
acceptance.

Result: 实验证明该方法有效减少静态偏差，并确认了场景预测损失的重要性

Conclusion: 提出的方法能够成功减少动作识别模型的静态偏差，提升模型性能

Abstract: Action recognition models rely excessively on static cues rather than dynamic
human motion, which is known as static bias. This bias leads to poor
performance in real-world applications and zero-shot action recognition. In
this paper, we propose a method to reduce static bias by separating temporal
dynamic information from static scene information. Our approach uses a
statistical independence loss between biased and unbiased streams, combined
with a scene prediction loss. Our experiments demonstrate that this method
effectively reduces static bias and confirm the importance of scene prediction
loss.

Conclusion: 通过特征去敏感化和自蒸馏对抗训练，可以显著减轻DNN对点云特征的过度依赖，从而增强模型对损坏点云的鲁棒性，为3D视觉任务的稳健性提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Due to scene complexity, sensor inaccuracies, and processing imprecision,
point cloud corruption is inevitable. Over-reliance on input features is the
root cause of DNN vulnerabilities. It remains unclear whether this issue exists
in 3D tasks involving point clouds and whether reducing dependence on these
features can enhance the model's robustness to corrupted point clouds. This
study attempts to answer these questions. Specifically, we quantified the
sensitivity of the DNN to point cloud features using Shapley values and found
that models trained using traditional methods exhibited high sensitivity values
for certain features. Furthermore, under an equal pruning ratio, prioritizing
the pruning of highly sensitive features causes more severe damage to model
performance than random pruning. We propose `Desensitized Adversarial Training'
(DesenAT), generating adversarial samples using feature desensitization and
conducting training within a self-distillation framework, which aims to
alleviate DNN's over-reliance on point clouds features by smoothing
sensitivity. First, data points with high contribution components are
eliminated, and spatial transformation is used to simulate corruption scenes,
generate adversarial samples, and conduct adversarial training on the model.
Next, to compensate for information loss in adversarial samples, we use the
self-distillation method to transfer knowledge from clean samples to
adversarial samples, and perform adversarial training in a distillation
manner.Extensive experiments on ModelNet-C and PointCloud-C demonstrate show
that the propose method can effectively improve the robustness of the model
without reducing the performance of clean data sets. This code is publicly

Abstract: Sign language translation from text to video plays a crucial role in enabling
effective communication for Deaf and hard--of--hearing individuals. A major
challenge lies in generating accurate and natural body poses and movements that
faithfully convey intended meanings. Prior methods often neglect the anatomical
constraints and coordination patterns of human skeletal motion, resulting in
rigid or biomechanically implausible outputs. To address this, we propose a
novel approach that explicitly models the relationships among skeletal
joints--including shoulders, arms, and hands--by incorporating geometric
constraints on joint positions, bone lengths, and movement dynamics. During
training, we introduce a parent-relative reweighting mechanism to enhance
finger flexibility and reduce motion stiffness. Additionally, bone-pose losses
and bone-length constraints enforce anatomically consistent structures. Our
method narrows the performance gap between the previous best and the
ground-truth oracle by 56.51%, and further reduces discrepancies in bone length
and movement variance by 18.76% and 5.48%, respectively, demonstrating
significant gains in anatomical realism and motion naturalness.

Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖语言推理，限制了决策能力。统一多模态模型支持多模态输入输出，具有通过生成视觉内容进行推理的更大潜力。

Method: 构建基于UMMs的规划框架，单一模型同时作为策略、动态模型和价值函数。提出自判别过滤方法，让生成模型作为自判别器过滤无效动态预测。

Conclusion: 这项工作为未来使用UMMs进行推理和决策的研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: With the powerful reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) and
vision-language models (VLMs), many recent works have explored using them for
decision-making. However, most of these approaches rely solely on
language-based reasoning, which limits their ability to reason and make
informed decisions. Recently, a promising new direction has emerged with
unified multimodal models (UMMs), which support both multimodal inputs and
outputs. We believe such models have greater potential for decision-making by
enabling reasoning through generated visual content. To this end, we propose
Uni-Plan, a planning framework built on UMMs. Within this framework, a single
model simultaneously serves as the policy, dynamics model, and value function.
In addition, to avoid hallucinations in dynamics predictions, we present a
novel approach self-discriminated filtering, where the generative model serves
as a self-discriminator to filter out invalid dynamics predictions. Experiments
on long-horizon planning tasks show that Uni-Plan substantially improves
success rates compared to VLM-based methods, while also showing strong data
scalability, requiring no expert demonstrations and achieving better
performance under the same training-data size. This work lays a foundation for
future research in reasoning and decision-making with UMMs.

Conclusion: DPM为生成AI时代的知识产权保护提供了实用且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: The widespread deployment of large vision models such as Stable Diffusion
raises significant legal and ethical concerns, as these models can memorize and
reproduce copyrighted content without authorization. Existing detection
approaches often lack robustness and fail to provide rigorous theoretical
underpinnings. To address these gaps, we formalize the concept of copyright
infringement and its detection from the perspective of Differential Privacy
(DP), and introduce the conditional sensitivity metric, a concept analogous to
sensitivity in DP, that quantifies the deviation in a diffusion model's output
caused by the inclusion or exclusion of a specific training data point. To
operationalize this metric, we propose D-Plus-Minus (DPM), a novel post-hoc
detection framework that identifies copyright infringement in text-to-image
diffusion models. Specifically, DPM simulates inclusion and exclusion processes
by fine-tuning models in two opposing directions: learning or unlearning.
Besides, to disentangle concept-specific influence from the global parameter
shifts induced by fine-tuning, DPM computes confidence scores over orthogonal
prompt distributions using statistical metrics. Moreover, to facilitate
standardized benchmarking, we also construct the Copyright Infringement
Detection Dataset (CIDD), a comprehensive resource for evaluating detection
across diverse categories. Our results demonstrate that DPM reliably detects
infringement content without requiring access to the original training dataset
or text prompts, offering an interpretable and practical solution for
safeguarding intellectual property in the era of generative AI.

Abstract: Perceptual losses have emerged as powerful tools for training networks to
enhance Low-Dose Computed Tomography (LDCT) images, offering an alternative to
traditional pixel-wise losses such as Mean Squared Error, which often lead to
over-smoothed reconstructions and loss of clinically relevant details in LDCT
images. The perceptual losses operate in a latent feature space defined by a
pretrained encoder and aim to preserve semantic content by comparing high-level
features rather than raw pixel values. However, the design of perceptual losses
involves critical yet underexplored decisions, including the feature
representation level, the dataset used to pretrain the encoder, and the
relative importance assigned to the perceptual component during optimization.
In this work, we introduce the concept of perceptual influence (a metric that
quantifies the relative contribution of the perceptual loss term to the total
loss) and propose a principled framework to assess the impact of the loss
design choices on the model training performance. Through systematic
experimentation, we show that the widely used configurations in the literature
to set up a perceptual loss underperform compared to better-designed
alternatives. Our findings show that better perceptual loss designs lead to
significant improvements in noise reduction and structural fidelity of
reconstructed CT images, without requiring any changes to the network
architecture. We also provide objective guidelines, supported by statistical
analysis, to inform the effective use of perceptual losses in LDCT denoising.

Abstract: Floods are increasingly frequent natural disasters causing extensive human
and economic damage, highlighting the critical need for rapid and accurate
flood inundation mapping. While remote sensing technologies have advanced flood
monitoring capabilities, operational challenges persist: single-sensor
approaches face weather-dependent data availability and limited revisit
periods, while multi-sensor fusion methods require substantial computational
resources and large-scale labeled datasets. To address these limitations, this
study introduces a novel sensor-flexible flood detection methodology by
fine-tuning Presto, a lightweight ($\sim$0.4M parameters) multi-modal
pre-trained transformer that processes both Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and
multispectral (MS) data at the pixel level. Our approach uniquely enables flood
mapping using SAR-only, MS-only, or combined SAR+MS inputs through a single
model architecture, addressing the critical operational need for rapid response
with whatever sensor data becomes available first during disasters. We
evaluated our method on the Sen1Floods11 dataset against the large-scale
Prithvi-100M baseline ($\sim$100M parameters) across three realistic data
availability scenarios. The proposed model achieved superior performance with
an F1 score of 0.896 and mIoU of 0.886 in the optimal sensor-fusion scenario,
outperforming the established baseline. Crucially, the model demonstrated
robustness by maintaining effective performance in MS-only scenarios (F1:
0.893) and functional capabilities in challenging SAR-only conditions (F1:
0.718), confirming the advantage of multi-modal pre-training for operational
flood mapping. Our parameter-efficient, sensor-flexible approach offers an
accessible and robust solution for real-world disaster scenarios requiring
immediate flood extent assessment regardless of sensor availability
constraints.

### [41] [GeLoc3r: Enhancing Relative Camera Pose Regression with Geometric Consistency Regularization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23038)
*Jingxing Li,Yongjae Lee,Deliang Fan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GeLoc3r通过几何一致性正则化增强相对相机姿态回归方法，在保持ReLoc3R快速推理速度的同时接近MASt3R的高精度，解决了速度-精度权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ReLoc3R虽然推理速度快，但其内部表示的几何不一致性限制了精度上限，无法达到基于对应点方法（如MASt3R）的精度水平。

Method: 在训练阶段使用真实深度生成密集3D-2D对应点，通过FusionTransformer学习对应点重要性，使用加权RANSAC计算几何一致姿态，创建一致性损失将几何知识转移到回归网络中。

Result: 在多个基准测试中显著优于ReLoc3R：CO3Dv2数据集AUC@5°从34.85%提升至40.45%（相对提升16%），RealEstate10K从66.70%提升至68.66%，MegaDepth1500从49.60%提升至50.45%。

Conclusion: 通过在训练而非推理时教授几何一致性，GeLoc3r代表了神经网络学习相机几何的范式转变，同时具备回归方法的速度和对应点方法的几何理解能力。

Abstract: Prior ReLoc3R achieves breakthrough performance with fast 25ms inference and
state-of-the-art regression accuracy, yet our analysis reveals subtle geometric
inconsistencies in its internal representations that prevent reaching the
precision ceiling of correspondence-based methods like MASt3R (which require
300ms per pair). In this work, we present GeLoc3r, a novel approach to relative
camera pose estimation that enhances pose regression methods through Geometric
Consistency Regularization (GCR). GeLoc3r overcomes the speed-accuracy dilemma
by training regression networks to produce geometrically consistent poses
without inference-time geometric computation. During training, GeLoc3r
leverages ground-truth depth to generate dense 3D-2D correspondences, weights
them using a FusionTransformer that learns correspondence importance, and
computes geometrically-consistent poses via weighted RANSAC. This creates a
consistency loss that transfers geometric knowledge into the regression
network. Unlike FAR method which requires both regression and geometric solving
at inference, GeLoc3r only uses the enhanced regression head at test time,
maintaining ReLoc3R's fast speed and approaching MASt3R's high accuracy. On
challenging benchmarks, GeLoc3r consistently outperforms ReLoc3R, achieving
significant improvements including 40.45% vs. 34.85% AUC@5{\deg} on the CO3Dv2
dataset (16% relative improvement), 68.66% vs. 66.70% AUC@5{\deg} on
RealEstate10K, and 50.45% vs. 49.60% on MegaDepth1500. By teaching geometric
consistency during training rather than enforcing it at inference, GeLoc3r
represents a paradigm shift in how neural networks learn camera geometry,
achieving both the speed of regression and the geometric understanding of
correspondence methods.

Abstract: Rehabilitation therapy for stroke patients faces a supply shortage despite
the increasing demand. To address this issue, remote monitoring systems that
reduce the burden on medical staff are emerging as a viable alternative. A key
component of these remote monitoring systems is Human Action Recognition (HAR)
technology, which classifies actions. However, existing HAR studies have
primarily focused on non-disable individuals, making them unsuitable for
recognizing the actions of stroke patients. HAR research for stroke has largely
concentrated on classifying relatively simple actions using machine learning
rather than deep learning. In this study, we designed a system to monitor the
actions of stroke patients, focusing on domiciliary upper limb Activities of
Daily Living (ADL). Our system utilizes IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) sensors
and an RGB-D camera, which are the most common modalities in HAR. We directly
collected a dataset through this system, investigated an appropriate preprocess
and proposed a deep learning model suitable for processing multimodal data. We
analyzed the collected dataset and found that the action data of stroke
patients is less clustering than that of non-disabled individuals.
Simultaneously, we found that the proposed model learns similar tendencies for
each label in data with features that are difficult to clustering. This study
suggests the possibility of expanding the deep learning model, which has
learned the action features of stroke patients, to not only simple action
recognition but also feedback such as assessment contributing to domiciliary
rehabilitation in future research. The code presented in this study is
available at https://github.com/ye-Kim/MMeViT.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为预训练分类器在任意图像上的决策提供最小化且忠实的解释，帮助理解模型行为并识别关键输入区域。

Method: 训练自编码器输出二元掩码，目标函数结合多层激活匹配（KL散度和交叉熵）、掩码先验（L1面积、二值化惩罚、总变差）和溯因约束，确保解释的忠实性和必要性。

Result: 生成小型、人类可解释的掩码，在保留分类器行为的同时丢弃不相关输入区域，提供实用且忠实的简约解释。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效生成最小化且忠实的解释，有助于理解模型决策过程并提高可解释性。

Abstract: In this paper we introduce an activation-matching--based approach to generate
minimal, faithful explanations for the decision-making of a pretrained
classifier on any given image. Given an input image \(x\) and a frozen model
\(f\), we train a lightweight autoencoder to output a binary mask \(m\) such
that the explanation \(e = m \odot x\) preserves both the model's prediction
and the intermediate activations of \(x\). Our objective combines: (i)
multi-layer activation matching with KL divergence to align distributions and
cross-entropy to retain the top-1 label for both the image and the explanation;
(ii) mask priors -- L1 area for minimality, a binarization penalty for crisp
0/1 masks, and total variation for compactness; and (iii) abductive constraints
for faithfulness and necessity. Together, these objectives yield small,
human-interpretable masks that retain classifier behavior while discarding
irrelevant input regions, providing practical and faithful minimalist
explanations for the decision making of the underlying model.

TL;DR: 提出了一种可控的文本引导掩码框架Mask What Matters，用于医学图像的自监督学习，通过视觉语言模型定位诊断相关区域，实现差异化掩码，在多种医学影像模态上显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像标注数据稀缺，现有自监督掩码图像建模方法依赖随机高比例掩码，导致效率低下和语义对齐不佳，需要更智能的掩码策略来提升模型性能。

Method: 利用视觉语言模型进行基于提示的区域定位，对诊断相关区域应用差异化掩码，减少背景区域的冗余，实现可控的文本引导掩码框架。

Result: 在脑MRI、胸部CT和肺部X射线等多种医学影像模态上，分类准确率提升高达3.1个百分点，检测任务中BoxAP提升1.3，MaskAP提升1.1，且掩码比例显著降低（40% vs 70%）。

Conclusion: 可控的文本驱动掩码能够实现语义对齐的自监督学习，推动医学图像分析中鲁棒视觉模型的发展。

Abstract: The scarcity of annotated data in specialized domains such as medical imaging
presents significant challenges to training robust vision models. While
self-supervised masked image modeling (MIM) offers a promising solution,
existing approaches largely rely on random high-ratio masking, leading to
inefficiency and poor semantic alignment. Moreover, region-aware variants
typically depend on reconstruction heuristics or supervised signals, limiting
their adaptability across tasks and modalities. We propose Mask What Matters, a
controllable text-guided masking framework for self-supervised medical image
analysis. By leveraging vision-language models for prompt-based region
localization, our method flexibly applies differentiated masking to emphasize
diagnostically relevant regions while reducing redundancy in background areas.
This controllable design enables better semantic alignment, improved
representation learning, and stronger cross-task generalizability.
Comprehensive evaluation across multiple medical imaging modalities, including
brain MRI, chest CT, and lung X-ray, shows that Mask What Matters consistently
outperforms existing MIM methods (e.g., SparK), achieving gains of up to +3.1
percentage points in classification accuracy, +1.3 in box average precision
(BoxAP), and +1.1 in mask average precision (MaskAP) for detection. Notably, it
achieves these improvements with substantially lower overall masking ratios
(e.g., 40\% vs. 70\%). This work demonstrates that controllable, text-driven
masking can enable semantically aligned self-supervised learning, advancing the
development of robust vision models for medical image analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 航空视角小物体检测面临视觉线索有限和全局上下文建模困难的问题，现有方法存在上下文融合延迟和非线性建模不足的性能瓶颈。

Method: 提出WeKat骨干网络使用小波变换增强全局低频上下文感知，采用Kolmogorov-Arnold网络进行自适应非线性建模；CPF模块减少冗余并改进多尺度特征交互；MDFC模块统一空间、频率和结构先验。

Result: 在基准航空视角数据集上达到最先进性能，参数更少。在VisDrone数据集上AP提升6.5%，AP50提升8.2%。

Conclusion: FMC-DETR通过频率解耦融合有效解决了航空视角小物体检测的挑战，在保持细节的同时增强全局感知，实现了优异的检测性能。

Abstract: Aerial-view object detection is a critical technology for real-world
applications such as natural resource monitoring, traffic management, and
UAV-based search and rescue. Detecting tiny objects in high-resolution aerial
imagery presents a long-standing challenge due to their limited visual cues and
the difficulty of modeling global context in complex scenes. Existing methods
are often hampered by delayed contextual fusion and inadequate non-linear
modeling, failing to effectively use global information to refine shallow
features and thus encountering a performance bottleneck. To address these
challenges, we propose FMC-DETR, a novel framework with frequency-decoupled
fusion for aerial-view object detection. First, we introduce the Wavelet
Kolmogorov-Arnold Transformer (WeKat) backbone, which applies cascaded wavelet
transforms to enhance global low-frequency context perception in shallow
features while preserving fine-grained details, and employs Kolmogorov-Arnold
networks to achieve adaptive non-linear modeling of multi-scale dependencies.
Next, a lightweight Cross-stage Partial Fusion (CPF) module reduces redundancy
and improves multi-scale feature interaction. Finally, we introduce the
Multi-Domain Feature Coordination (MDFC) module, which unifies spatial,
frequency, and structural priors to to balance detail preservation and global
enhancement. Extensive experiments on benchmark aerial-view datasets
demonstrate that FMC-DETR achieves state-of-the-art performance with fewer
parameters. On the challenging VisDrone dataset, our model achieves
improvements of 6.5% AP and 8.2% AP50 over the baseline, highlighting its
effectiveness in tiny object detection. The code can be accessed at

Method: 利用直接偏好优化方法进行对齐训练，使用公共奖励模型构建偏好训练数据集，在9个奖励模型、2个基准测试和2个基线模型上进行实验。

Result: 发现奖励模型存在亮度、构图和色彩方案等偏差，但通过简单集成可缓解这些偏差；对齐模型在标准指标、GPT-4评估和人工评估中显著优于先前模型。

Conclusion: 该方法为图像修复偏好对齐领域设定了简单而坚实的基线，推动了这一有前景领域的发展。

Abstract: This paper investigates image inpainting with preference alignment. Instead
of introducing a novel method, we go back to basics and revisit fundamental
problems in achieving such alignment. We leverage the prominent direct
preference optimization approach for alignment training and employ public
reward models to construct preference training datasets. Experiments are
conducted across nine reward models, two benchmarks, and two baseline models
with varying structures and generative algorithms. Our key findings are as
follows: (1) Most reward models deliver valid reward scores for constructing
preference data, even if some of them are not reliable evaluators. (2)
Preference data demonstrates robust trends in both candidate scaling and sample
scaling across models and benchmarks. (3) Observable biases in reward models,
particularly in brightness, composition, and color scheme, render them
susceptible to cause reward hacking. (4) A simple ensemble of these models
yields robust and generalizable results by mitigating such biases. Built upon
these observations, our alignment models significantly outperform prior models
across standard metrics, GPT-4 assessments, and human evaluations, without any
changes to model structures or the use of new datasets. We hope our work can
set a simple yet solid baseline, pushing this promising frontier. Our code is
open-sourced at: https://github.com/shenytzzz/Follow-Your-Preference.

TL;DR: XMAG是一个轻量级基础模型，通过跨放大倍数蒸馏技术将20x放大倍数的教师模型知识转移到5x放大倍数的学生架构，在保持诊断精度的同时实现30倍处理加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基础模型在计算病理学中参数庞大、处理需求高，难以在临床环境中部署。需要开发轻量级模型来降低计算成本。

Method: 采用跨放大倍数蒸馏框架，包括双级知识转移（全局图像表示和局部空间token映射对齐），使用紧凑骨干网络，完全在5x放大倍数下运行。

Result: 在6个临床相关组织病理学分析任务中，XMAG的诊断准确率与更大基础模型相差不到1%，同时处理速度达到30倍加速（8.8张WSI/分钟）。

Conclusion: 跨放大倍数蒸馏是资源受限临床环境中部署基础模型能力的可行方法，有望实现实时病理AI集成。

Abstract: Foundation models (FM) have transformed computational pathology but remain
computationally prohibitive for clinical deployment due to their massive
parameter counts and high-magnification processing requirements. Here, we
introduce XMAG, a lightweight FM developed through corss-magnification
distillation that transfers knowledge from state-of-the-art 20x magnification
teacher to an efficient 5x magnification student architecture. XMAG employs a
compact backbone and operates entirely at 5x, requiring 11.3 times fewer
patches per whole slide image (WSI) compared to existing approaches. Our Novel
distillation framework incorporates dual-level knowledge transfer, aligning
both global image representations and local spatial token mapping. We trained
XMAG on 3.49 million images curated from publicly available datasets and
evaluated performance across six clinically relevant histopathology analysis
tasks spanning multiple cancer types. XMAG achieved diagnostic accuracy within
1% of substantially larger foundation models while delivering 30-fold
processing acceleration, reaching 8.8 WSIs per minute processing speed. Our
cross-institutional validation confirmed robust generalization. Further, we
developed an end-to-end training strategy to further boost our model's
performance to approach the larger FMs' performance. These results establish
cross-magnification distillation as a viable approach for deploying FM
capabilities in resource-constrained clinical environments, potentially
enabling real-time pathology AI integration.

*Na Min An,Inha Kang,Minhyun Lee,Hyunjung Shim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoPatch是一个零样本参考图像分割框架，通过利用模型内部组件增强文本和图像模态的空间表示，无需额外训练即可显著提升空间定位能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基础视觉语言模型（如CLIP）在图像-文本对齐方面表现出色，但在理解空间关系方面存在困难。文本流中现有方法主要关注主要名词短语而忽略上下文标记，视觉流中CLIP对具有不同空间布局的图像生成相似特征，导致空间结构敏感性有限。

Method: CoPatch框架在语言方面构建包含空间线索上下文标记的混合文本特征；在视觉方面从中间层提取patch级图像特征，其中空间结构得到更好保留。这些增强特征融合到聚类图像-文本相似度图CoMap中，实现精确掩码选择。

Result: CoPatch在RefCOCO、RefCOCO+、RefCOCOg和PhraseCut数据集上的零样本参考图像分割性能显著提升（mIoU提高2-7点），无需任何额外训练。

Conclusion: 研究强调了恢复和利用视觉语言模型中固有但未被开发的空间知识的重要性，为零样本参考图像分割开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Spatial grounding is crucial for referring image segmentation (RIS), where
the goal of the task is to localize an object described by language. Current
foundational vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, excel at aligning
images and text but struggle with understanding spatial relationships. Within
the language stream, most existing methods often focus on the primary noun
phrase when extracting local text features, undermining contextual tokens.
Within the vision stream, CLIP generates similar features for images with
different spatial layouts, resulting in limited sensitivity to spatial
structure. To address these limitations, we propose \textsc{CoPatch}, a
zero-shot RIS framework that leverages internal model components to enhance
spatial representations in both text and image modalities. For language,
\textsc{CoPatch} constructs hybrid text features by incorporating context
tokens carrying spatial cues. For vision, it extracts patch-level image
features using our novel path discovered from intermediate layers, where
spatial structure is better preserved. These enhanced features are fused into a
clustered image-text similarity map, \texttt{CoMap}, enabling precise mask
selection. As a result, \textsc{CoPatch} significantly improves spatial
grounding in zero-shot RIS across RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, RefCOCOg, and PhraseCut (+
2--7 mIoU) without requiring any additional training. Our findings underscore
the importance of recovering and leveraging the untapped spatial knowledge
inherently embedded in VLMs, thereby paving the way for opportunities in
zero-shot RIS.

Motivation: 降低乘法运算成本对于能效受限的边缘设备部署深度神经网络至关重要，特别是在卷积层中减少乘法操作。

Method: 选择性用混合哈达玛变换层替换中间卷积层，通过免乘法内存操作实现内部卷积，结合结构化哈达玛变换和SRAM内存计算。

Result: 在ResNet-18/20/50上消除高达52%的乘法运算，在CIFAR-10/100和Tiny ImageNet上保持可比精度，显著减少计算复杂度和参数数量。

Conclusion: 结合结构化哈达玛变换层和SRAM内存计算免乘法操作是实现高效深度学习架构的有前景路径。

Abstract: Reducing the cost of multiplications is critical for efficient deep neural
network deployment, especially in energy-constrained edge devices. In this
work, we introduce HTMA-Net, a novel framework that integrates the Hadamard
Transform (HT) with multiplication-avoiding (MA) SRAM-based in-memory computing
to reduce arithmetic complexity while maintaining accuracy. Unlike prior
methods that only target multiplications in convolutional layers or focus
solely on in-memory acceleration, HTMA-Net selectively replaces intermediate
convolutions with Hybrid Hadamard-based transform layers whose internal
convolutions are implemented via multiplication-avoiding in-memory operations.
We evaluate HTMA-Net on ResNet-18 using CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny ImageNet,
and provide a detailed comparison against regular, MF-only, and HT-only
variants. Results show that HTMA-Net eliminates up to 52\% of multiplications
compared to baseline ResNet-18, ResNet-20, and ResNet-50 models, while
achieving comparable accuracy in evaluation and significantly reducing
computational complexity and the number of parameters. Our results demonstrate
that combining structured Hadamard transform layers with SRAM-based in-memory
computing multiplication-avoiding operators is a promising path towards
efficient deep learning architectures.

Abstract: Remote sensing change understanding (RSCU) is essential for analyzing remote
sensing images and understanding how human activities affect the environment.
However, existing datasets lack deep understanding and interactions in the
diverse change captioning, counting, and localization tasks. To tackle these
gaps, we construct ChangeIMTI, a new large-scale interactive multi-task
instruction dataset that encompasses four complementary tasks including change
captioning, binary change classification, change counting, and change
localization. Building upon this new dataset, we further design a novel
vision-guided vision-language model (ChangeVG) with dual-granularity awareness
for bi-temporal remote sensing images (i.e., two remote sensing images of the
same area at different times). The introduced vision-guided module is a
dual-branch architecture that synergistically combines fine-grained spatial
feature extraction with high-level semantic summarization. These enriched
representations further serve as the auxiliary prompts to guide large
vision-language models (VLMs) (e.g., Qwen2.5-VL-7B) during instruction tuning,
thereby facilitating the hierarchical cross-modal learning. We extensively
conduct experiments across four tasks to demonstrate the superiority of our
approach. Remarkably, on the change captioning task, our method outperforms the
strongest method Semantic-CC by 1.39 points on the comprehensive S*m metric,
which integrates the semantic similarity and descriptive accuracy to provide an
overall evaluation of change caption. Moreover, we also perform a series of
ablation studies to examine the critical components of our method.

Motivation: 解决现有图像生成模型在计算成本与保真度之间的权衡问题，包括VAE模型的信息丢失和细节限制，以及像素空间模型的过高计算成本。

Method: 使用条件依赖耦合策略将生成过程分解为多阶段插值轨迹，构建单一统一的扩散变换器模型，避免模块分离并支持知识共享。

Result: 在多个分辨率下实现了高保真度和高效率，通过广泛实验验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该统一多阶段生成框架成功解决了计算成本与保真度的权衡问题，实现了准确分布学习和端到端优化。

Abstract: Existing image generation models face critical challenges regarding the
trade-off between computation and fidelity. Specifically, models relying on a
pretrained Variational Autoencoder (VAE) suffer from information loss, limited
detail, and the inability to support end-to-end training. In contrast, models
operating directly in the pixel space incur prohibitive computational cost.
Although cascade models can mitigate computational cost, stage-wise separation
prevents effective end-to-end optimization, hampers knowledge sharing, and
often results in inaccurate distribution learning within each stage. To address
these challenges, we introduce a unified multistage generative framework based
on our proposed Conditional Dependent Coupling strategy. It decomposes the
generative process into interpolant trajectories at multiple stages, ensuring
accurate distribution learning while enabling end-to-end optimization.
Importantly, the entire process is modeled as a single unified Diffusion
Transformer, eliminating the need for disjoint modules and also enabling
knowledge sharing. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves
both high fidelity and efficiency across multiple resolutions.

Abstract: Non-contrast computed tomography (NCCT) is essential for rapid stroke
diagnosis but is limited by low image contrast and signal to noise ratio. We
address this challenge by leveraging DINOv3, a state-of-the-art self-supervised
vision transformer, to generate powerful feature representations for a
comprehensive set of stroke analysis tasks. Our evaluation encompasses infarct
and hemorrhage segmentation, anomaly classification (normal vs. stroke and
normal vs. infarct vs. hemorrhage), hemorrhage subtype classification (EDH,
SDH, SAH, IPH, IVH), and dichotomized ASPECTS classification (<=6 vs. >6) on
multiple public and private datasets. This study establishes strong benchmarks
for these tasks and demonstrates the potential of advanced self-supervised
models to improve automated stroke diagnosis from NCCT, providing a clear
analysis of both the advantages and current constraints of the approach. The

TL;DR: 提出了Earth-Agent，首个基于MCP工具生态系统的智能体框架，统一RGB和光谱遥感数据，支持跨模态、多步骤的定量时空推理，超越了预训练MLLMs的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs在处理需要多步骤推理和领域专用工具的复杂遥感任务时能力不足，而基于智能体的方法仍处于初级阶段，局限于RGB感知、浅层推理且缺乏系统评估协议。

Method: 构建了基于MCP的工具生态系统，支持动态调用跨模态的专家工具和模型，实现复杂科学任务如地球物理参数检索和定量时空分析。

Result: 开发了Earth-Bench基准测试，包含248个专家策划任务和13,729张图像，涵盖光谱、产品和RGB模态，采用双级评估协议评估推理轨迹和最终结果。

Conclusion: Earth-Agent为遥感分析建立了新范式，推动了LLMs在地球观测中科学基础化的下一代应用，展示了其有效性和潜力。

Abstract: Earth observation (EO) is essential for understanding the evolving states of
the Earth system. Although recent MLLMs have advanced EO research, they still
lack the capability to tackle complex tasks that require multi-step reasoning
and the use of domain-specific tools. Agent-based methods offer a promising
direction, but current attempts remain in their infancy, confined to RGB
perception, shallow reasoning, and lacking systematic evaluation protocols. To
overcome these limitations, we introduce Earth-Agent, the first agentic
framework that unifies RGB and spectral EO data within an MCP-based tool
ecosystem, enabling cross-modal, multi-step, and quantitative spatiotemporal
reasoning beyond pretrained MLLMs. Earth-Agent supports complex scientific
tasks such as geophysical parameter retrieval and quantitative spatiotemporal
analysis by dynamically invoking expert tools and models across modalities. To
support comprehensive evaluation, we further propose Earth-Bench, a benchmark
of 248 expert-curated tasks with 13,729 images, spanning spectrum, products and
RGB modalities, and equipped with a dual-level evaluation protocol that
assesses both reasoning trajectories and final outcomes. We conduct
comprehensive experiments varying different LLM backbones, comparisons with
general agent frameworks, and comparisons with MLLMs on remote sensing
benchmarks, demonstrating both the effectiveness and potential of Earth-Agent.
Earth-Agent establishes a new paradigm for EO analysis, moving the field toward
scientifically grounded, next-generation applications of LLMs in Earth
observation. Our code and dataset will be publicly released.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WeatherCycle是一个统一的非配对框架，通过双向退化-内容转换循环解决多天气条件下的图像恢复问题，使用亮度-色度分解策略分离退化与内容，无需复杂天气建模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的图像恢复方法通常依赖特定任务的物理先验，其狭窄的焦点限制了在多样化真实天气场景中的可扩展性和泛化能力。

Method: 采用亮度-色度分解策略分离退化与内容；提出亮度退化引导模块(LDGM)从退化图像池学习亮度退化先验；引入难度感知对比正则化(DACR)模块通过CLIP分类器识别困难样本。

Result: 在多个多天气数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法在无监督方法中达到了最先进的性能，对复杂天气退化具有强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: WeatherCycle框架通过统一的非配对方法有效解决了多天气条件下的图像恢复问题，展示了在复杂天气退化场景中的优越性能。

Abstract: Unsupervised image restoration under multi-weather conditions remains a
fundamental yet underexplored challenge. While existing methods often rely on
task-specific physical priors, their narrow focus limits scalability and
generalization to diverse real-world weather scenarios. In this work, we
propose \textbf{WeatherCycle}, a unified unpaired framework that reformulates
weather restoration as a bidirectional degradation-content translation cycle,
guided by degradation-aware curriculum regularization. At its core,
WeatherCycle employs a \textit{lumina-chroma decomposition} strategy to
decouple degradation from content without modeling complex weather, enabling
domain conversion between degraded and clean images. To model diverse and
complex degradations, we propose a \textit{Lumina Degradation Guidance Module}
(LDGM), which learns luminance degradation priors from a degraded image pool
and injects them into clean images via frequency-domain amplitude modulation,
enabling controllable and realistic degradation modeling. Additionally, we
incorporate a \textit{Difficulty-Aware Contrastive Regularization (DACR)}
module that identifies hard samples via a CLIP-based classifier and enforces
contrastive alignment between hard samples and restored features to enhance
semantic consistency and robustness. Extensive experiments across serve
multi-weather datasets, demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance among unsupervised approaches, with strong generalization to
complex weather degradations.

TL;DR: Sparse2Dense是一个基于关键点的生成框架，使用稀疏3D关键点作为传输符号，实现超低码率人体视频压缩和精确顶点预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决带宽受限多媒体应用中同时实现超低码率人体视频压缩和准确顶点预测的挑战，需要协调动态运动建模、细节外观合成和几何一致性。

Method: 提出多任务学习和关键点感知的深度生成模型，通过紧凑3D关键点编码复杂人体运动，利用稀疏关键点估计密集运动进行视频合成，并集成顶点预测器学习人体顶点几何。

Result: 实验表明Sparse2Dense在人体视频压缩方面优于传统/生成式视频编解码器，同时能实现精确的人体顶点预测。

Conclusion: Sparse2Dense有望促进带宽高效的人体中心媒体传输，应用于实时运动分析、虚拟人动画和沉浸式娱乐等领域。

Abstract: For bandwidth-constrained multimedia applications, simultaneously achieving
ultra-low bitrate human video compression and accurate vertex prediction
remains a critical challenge, as it demands the harmonization of dynamic motion
modeling, detailed appearance synthesis, and geometric consistency. To address
this challenge, we propose Sparse2Dense, a keypoint-driven generative framework
that leverages extremely sparse 3D keypoints as compact transmitted symbols to
enable ultra-low bitrate human video compression and precise human vertex
prediction. The key innovation is the multi-task learning-based and
keypoint-aware deep generative model, which could encode complex human motion
via compact 3D keypoints and leverage these sparse keypoints to estimate dense
motion for video synthesis with temporal coherence and realistic textures.
Additionally, a vertex predictor is integrated to learn human vertex geometry
through joint optimization with video generation, ensuring alignment between
visual content and geometric structure. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
the proposed Sparse2Dense framework achieves competitive compression
performance for human video over traditional/generative video codecs, whilst
enabling precise human vertex prediction for downstream geometry applications.
As such, Sparse2Dense is expected to facilitate bandwidth-efficient
human-centric media transmission, such as real-time motion analysis, virtual
human animation, and immersive entertainment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确的车轴计数对交通控制、收费和基础设施发展至关重要，现有方法在密集环境中存在局限性。

Method: 使用YOLO-OBB检测分类车辆，YOLO检测轮胎，提出TRAX算法跟踪帧间车轴特征，智能关联轮胎与对应车辆。

Result: 显著减少误报，提高长车辆车轴计数准确性，在真实交通视频中表现出强大鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 这是向可扩展AI驱动车轴计数系统的重要一步，为机器视觉替代传统路边基础设施铺平道路。

Abstract: Accurate counting of vehicle axles is essential for traffic control, toll
collection, and infrastructure development. We present an end-to-end,
video-based pipeline for axle counting that tackles limitations of previous
works in dense environments. Our system leverages a combination of YOLO-OBB to
detect and categorize vehicles, and YOLO to detect tires. Detected tires are
intelligently associated to their respective parent vehicles, enabling accurate
axle prediction even in complex scenarios. However, there are a few challenges
in detection when it comes to scenarios with longer and occluded vehicles. We
mitigate vehicular occlusions and partial detections for longer vehicles by
proposing a novel TRAX (Tire and Axle Tracking) Algorithm to successfully track
axle-related features between frames. Our method stands out by significantly
reducing false positives and improving the accuracy of axle-counting for long
vehicles, demonstrating strong robustness in real-world traffic videos. This
work represents a significant step toward scalable, AI-driven axle counting
systems, paving the way for machine vision to replace legacy roadside
infrastructure.

*Behraj Khan,Tahir Qasim Syed*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CalSAM是一个轻量级适配框架，通过特征Fisher信息惩罚和置信度错位惩罚，在冻结SAM编码器的情况下仅微调掩码解码器，显著提升了医学图像分割的准确性和校准性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM在自然图像上表现出强大的零样本性能，但在应用于医学体积数据时存在域偏移和过度自信的问题。

Method: 提出CalSAM框架：(i)通过3D特征图上的特征Fisher信息惩罚降低编码器对域偏移的敏感性；(ii)通过置信度错位惩罚惩罚过度自信的体素级误差。结合损失函数仅微调掩码解码器，保持SAM编码器冻结。

Result: 在跨中心和扫描仪偏移评估中，CalSAM显著提高了准确性和校准性：在BraTS扫描仪分割上，DSC相对提升+7.4%，HD95减少-26.9%，ECE减少-39.5%；在ATLAS-C上，DSC相对提升+5.3%，ECE减少-32.6%。

Conclusion: CalSAM为脑MRI分割提供了改进的域泛化能力和更好的校准不确定性估计，同时保留了冻结SAM编码器的计算优势。

Abstract: The Segment Anything Model (SAM) exhibits strong zero-shot performance on
natural images but suffers from domain shift and overconfidence when applied to
medical volumes. We propose \textbf{CalSAM}, a lightweight adaptation framework
that (i) reduces encoder sensitivity to domain shift via a \emph{Feature Fisher
Information Penalty} (FIP) computed on 3D feature maps and (ii) penalizes
overconfident voxel-wise errors through a \emph{Confidence Misalignment
Penalty} (CMP). The combined loss, \(\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{CalSAM}}\) fine-tunes
only the mask decoder while keeping SAM's encoders frozen. On cross-center and
scanner-shift evaluations, CalSAM substantially improves accuracy and
calibration: e.g., on the BraTS scanner split (Siemens$\to$GE) CalSAM shows a
$+7.4\%$ relative improvement in $\mathrm{DSC}$ (80.1\% vs.\ 74.6\%), a
$-26.9\%$ reduction in $\mathrm{HD95}$ (4.6 mm vs.\ 6.3 mm), and a $-39.5\%$
reduction in $\mathrm{ECE}$ (5.2\% vs.\ 8.6\%). On ATLAS-C (motion
corruptions), CalSAM achieves a $+5.3\%$ relative improvement in $\mathrm{DSC}$
(75.9\%) and a $-32.6\%$ reduction in $\mathrm{ECE}$ (5.8\%). Ablations show
FIP and CMP contribute complementary gains ($p<0.01$), and the Fisher penalty
incurs a modest $\sim$15\% training-time overhead. CalSAM therefore delivers
improved domain generalization and better-calibrated uncertainty estimates for
brain MRI segmentation, while retaining the computational benefits of freezing
SAM's encoder.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无监督在线3D实例分割方法（如UNIT）存在训练多样性有限、时间采样僵化以及对噪声伪标签依赖性强的问题，需要改进这些限制。

Method: 1）通过合成点云序列生成丰富训练分布；2）采用灵活的时间采样策略，结合相邻和非相邻帧；3）使用动态加权损失强调置信度高和信息丰富的样本。

Result: 在SemanticKITTI、nuScenes和PandaSet数据集上的实验表明，该方法持续优于UNIT和其他无监督基线方法，实现了更高的分割精度和更鲁棒的时间关联性。

Conclusion: 所提出的框架通过增强训练多样性、灵活时间采样和动态加权损失，显著提升了无监督在线3D实例分割的性能，代码将公开可用。

Abstract: Unsupervised online 3D instance segmentation is a fundamental yet challenging
task, as it requires maintaining consistent object identities across LiDAR
scans without relying on annotated training data. Existing methods, such as
UNIT, have made progress in this direction but remain constrained by limited
training diversity, rigid temporal sampling, and heavy dependence on noisy
pseudo-labels. We propose a new framework that enriches the training
distribution through synthetic point cloud sequence generation, enabling
greater diversity without relying on manual labels or simulation engines. To
better capture temporal dynamics, our method incorporates a flexible sampling
strategy that leverages both adjacent and non-adjacent frames, allowing the
model to learn from long-range dependencies as well as short-term variations.
In addition, a dynamic-weighting loss emphasizes confident and informative
samples, guiding the network toward more robust representations. Through
extensive experiments on SemanticKITTI, nuScenes, and PandaSet, our method
consistently outperforms UNIT and other unsupervised baselines, achieving
higher segmentation accuracy and more robust temporal associations. The code
will be publicly available at github.com/Eaphan/SFT3D.

Motivation: 现有对抗攻击大多局限于数字域或需要白盒访问，需要开发在黑盒设置下仍能物理转移的实用攻击方法

Method: 使用查询高效的零阶贪婪算法，通过添加高斯斑点迭代构建对称灰度补丁，仅依赖余弦相似度分数来最大化降低身份识别准确率

Result: 仅需约10,000次查询即可在黑盒ArcFace模型上获得高攻击成功率，在数字和现实物理测试中均有效，并能成功欺骗未见过的FaceNet模型

Conclusion: 这项工作揭示了人脸识别系统的严重实际漏洞，证明即使对目标系统了解有限，也能构建鲁棒且可转移的对抗攻击

Abstract: Adversarial attacks on face recognition (FR) systems pose a significant
security threat, yet most are confined to the digital domain or require
white-box access. We introduce GaP (Gaussian Patch), a novel method to generate
a universal, physically transferable adversarial patch under a strict black-box
setting. Our approach uses a query-efficient, zero-order greedy algorithm to
iteratively construct a symmetric, grayscale pattern for the forehead. The
patch is optimized by successively adding Gaussian blobs, guided only by the
cosine similarity scores from a surrogate FR model to maximally degrade
identity recognition. We demonstrate that with approximately 10,000 queries to
a black-box ArcFace model, the resulting GaP achieves a high attack success
rate in both digital and real-world physical tests. Critically, the attack
shows strong transferability, successfully deceiving an entirely unseen FaceNet
model. Our work highlights a practical and severe vulnerability, proving that
robust, transferable attacks can be crafted with limited knowledge of the
target system.

Abstract: Ultrasound tongue imaging (UTI) is a non-invasive and cost-effective tool for
studying speech articulation, motor control, and related disorders. However,
real-time tongue contour segmentation remains challenging due to low
signal-to-noise ratios, imaging variability, and computational demands. We

*Seongsoo Heo,Dong-Wan Choi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Patch Rebirth Inversion (PRI)方法，通过渐进式分离重要patch来构建稀疏合成图像，同时让剩余patch继续演化，在保持性能的同时显著提升模型反转效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Sparse Model Inversion (SMI)方法在ViT模型反转中过早丢弃看似不重要的patch，但研究发现这些patch实际上能通过持续反转获得可迁移知识，丢弃它们会抑制类无关特征的提取。

Method: PRI在反转过程中逐步分离最重要patch构建稀疏图像，同时允许剩余patch继续演化以供后续选择，实现渐进式稀疏化。

Result: PRI比标准Dense Model Inversion快10倍，比SMI快2倍，在准确率上优于SMI并与DMI相当。

Conclusion: PRI通过渐进式patch分离策略有效平衡了类无关和类特定知识，实现了高效且高性能的模型反转。

Abstract: Model inversion is a widely adopted technique in data-free learning that
reconstructs synthetic inputs from a pretrained model through iterative
optimization, without access to original training data. Unfortunately, its
application to state-of-the-art Vision Transformers (ViTs) poses a major
computational challenge, due to their expensive self-attention mechanisms. To
address this, Sparse Model Inversion (SMI) was proposed to improve efficiency
by pruning and discarding seemingly unimportant patches, which were even
claimed to be obstacles to knowledge transfer. However, our empirical findings
suggest the opposite: even randomly selected patches can eventually acquire
transferable knowledge through continued inversion. This reveals that
discarding any prematurely inverted patches is inefficient, as it suppresses
the extraction of class-agnostic features essential for knowledge transfer,
along with class-specific features. In this paper, we propose Patch Rebirth
Inversion (PRI), a novel approach that incrementally detaches the most
important patches during the inversion process to construct sparse synthetic
images, while allowing the remaining patches to continue evolving for future
selection. This progressive strategy not only improves efficiency, but also
encourages initially less informative patches to gradually accumulate more
class-relevant knowledge, a phenomenon we refer to as the Re-Birth effect,
thereby effectively balancing class-agnostic and class-specific knowledge.
Experimental results show that PRI achieves up to 10x faster inversion than
standard Dense Model Inversion (DMI) and 2x faster than SMI, while consistently
outperforming SMI in accuracy and matching the performance of DMI.

Motivation: 视觉语言模型经常产生幻觉细节，生成不存在的对象或不准确的属性，影响输出可靠性。现有方法需要大量人工标注或更强大模型的外部监督

Method: 设计自反思管道，将详细模型响应与简洁二元答案进行比较，利用不一致信号自动筛选高质量训练数据，仅依赖自一致性而非外部监督

Result: 在AMBER、MultiObject-Hal、Object HalBench和MMHal-Bench等多个基准测试中，事实基础和可靠性显著提升，同时在LLaVA-Bench和MMBench上保持强大的指令跟随能力

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种可扩展且高效的解决方案，仅使用未标记数据就能有效减少幻觉，同时保持模型性能

Abstract: Vision-language models often hallucinate details, generating non-existent
objects or inaccurate attributes that compromise output reliability. Existing
methods typically address these issues via extensive human annotations or
external supervision from more powerful models. In this work, we present a
novel framework that leverages the model's self-consistency between long
responses and short answers to generate preference pairs for training. We
observe that short binary questions tend to yield highly reliable responses,
which can be used to query the target model to evaluate and rank its generated
responses. Specifically, we design a self-reflection pipeline where detailed
model responses are compared against concise binary answers, and inconsistency
signals are utilized to automatically curate high-quality training data without
human annotations or external model-based supervision. By relying solely on
self-consistency rather than external supervision, our method offers a scalable
and efficient solution that effectively reduces hallucinations using unlabeled
data. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks, i.e., AMBER,
MultiObject-Hal (ROPE), Object HalBench, and MMHal-Bench, demonstrate
significant improvements in factual grounding and reliability. Moreover, our
approach maintains robust instruction-following ability, as evidenced by
enhanced performance on LLaVA-Bench and MMBench.

Motivation: 现有时尚搭配完成方法需要昂贵的大规模标注数据和任务特定训练，且缺乏明确的人类美学指导。在多模态大语言模型时代，传统训练流程可以简化为无需训练的模式。

Method: 使用MLLMs生成目标物品描述，通过美学思维链将图像提炼为结构化美学特征（颜色、风格、场合、季节、材料、平衡），通过动态熵门控机制融合视觉摘要、文本描述和美学向量。

Conclusion: TATTOO方法在无需训练的情况下实现了更好的推荐分数和增强的美学感知能力，为时尚搭配推荐提供了新的训练免费范式。

Abstract: The global fashion e-commerce market relies significantly on intelligent and
aesthetic-aware outfit-completion tools to promote sales. While previous
studies have approached the problem of fashion outfit-completion and
compatible-item retrieval, most of them require expensive, task-specific
training on large-scale labeled data, and no effort is made to guide outfit
recommendation with explicit human aesthetics. In the era of Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs), we show that the conventional training-based pipeline
could be streamlined to a training-free paradigm, with better recommendation
scores and enhanced aesthetic awareness. We achieve this with TATTOO, a
Training-free AesTheTic-aware Outfit recommendation approach. It first
generates a target-item description using MLLMs, followed by an aesthetic
chain-of-thought used to distill the images into a structured aesthetic profile
including color, style, occasion, season, material, and balance. By fusing the
visual summary of the outfit with the textual description and aesthetics
vectors using a dynamic entropy-gated mechanism, candidate items can be
represented in a shared embedding space and be ranked accordingly. Experiments
on a real-world evaluation set Aesthetic-100 show that TATTOO achieves
state-of-the-art performance compared with existing training-based methods.
Another standard Polyvore dataset is also used to measure the advanced
zero-shot retrieval capability of our training-free method.

Motivation: 热成像在ADAS中具有优势，但研究面临数据集有限和驾驶模拟器中代表性不足的挑战。现有的RGB到热成像转换方法主要关注一对一映射。

Method: 使用多模态转换框架，提出CoAdaIN方法，与原始AdaIN全局应用风格不同，CoAdaIN将风格适配到不同的图像组件个体。

Result: 该方法能够生成更真实和多样化的热成像图像转换结果。

Conclusion: CoAdaIN方法在RGB到热成像图像转换中实现了更优的一对多映射效果，为ADAS系统提供了更好的热成像数据生成能力。

Abstract: Thermal imaging in Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) improves road
safety with superior perception in low-light and harsh weather conditions
compared to traditional RGB cameras. However, research in this area faces
challenges due to limited dataset availability and poor representation in
driving simulators. RGB-to-thermal image translation offers a potential
solution, but existing methods focus on one-to-one mappings. We propose a
one-to-many mapping using a multi-modal translation framework enhanced with our
Component-aware Adaptive Instance Normalization (CoAdaIN). Unlike the original
AdaIN, which applies styles globally, CoAdaIN adapts styles to different image
components individually. The result, as we show, is more realistic and diverse
thermal image translations. This is the accepted author manuscript of the paper

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种直接从点云几何中提取的紧凑且可解释的特征集，为端到端深度学习提供了准确高效的替代方案。

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition supports applications in healthcare,
manufacturing, and human-machine interaction. LiDAR point clouds offer a
privacy-preserving alternative to cameras and are robust to illumination. We
propose a HAR method based on graph spectral analysis. Each LiDAR frame is
mapped to a proximity graph (epsilon-graph) and the Laplacian spectrum is
computed. Eigenvalues and statistics of eigenvectors form pose descriptors, and
temporal statistics over sliding windows yield fixed vectors for classification
with support vector machines and random forests. On the MM-Fi dataset with 40
subjects and 27 activities, under a strict subject-independent protocol, the
method reaches 94.4% accuracy on a 13-class rehabilitation set and 90.3% on all
27 activities. It also surpasses the skeleton-based baselines reported for
MM-Fi. The contribution is a compact and interpretable feature set derived
directly from point cloud geometry that provides an accurate and efficient
alternative to end-to-end deep learning.

TL;DR: OracleGS框架通过"提议-验证"方法，结合生成模型的完整性和回归模型的几何保真度，解决稀疏视图新视角合成的几何模糊问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏视图新视角合成存在严重的几何模糊问题，现有方法在生成完整性和几何保真度之间存在权衡：回归模型几何准确但不完整，生成模型能补全场景但常引入结构不一致。

Method: 使用预训练的3D感知扩散模型生成完整场景提议，然后利用多视角立体模型作为3D感知预言机验证生成视图的3D不确定性，通过不确定性加权损失指导3D高斯泼溅模型优化。

Result: 在Mip-NeRF 360和NeRF Synthetic等数据集上超越了最先进方法，能够过滤幻觉伪影同时保留在约束不足区域中的合理补全。

Conclusion: OracleGS成功地将强大的生成先验与多视角几何证据相结合，在稀疏视图高斯泼溅中实现了生成完整性与回归保真度的调和。

Abstract: Sparse-view novel view synthesis is fundamentally ill-posed due to severe
geometric ambiguity. Current methods are caught in a trade-off: regressive
models are geometrically faithful but incomplete, whereas generative models can
complete scenes but often introduce structural inconsistencies. We propose
OracleGS, a novel framework that reconciles generative completeness with
regressive fidelity for sparse view Gaussian Splatting. Instead of using
generative models to patch incomplete reconstructions, our
"propose-and-validate" framework first leverages a pre-trained 3D-aware
diffusion model to synthesize novel views to propose a complete scene. We then
repurpose a multi-view stereo (MVS) model as a 3D-aware oracle to validate the
3D uncertainties of generated views, using its attention maps to reveal regions
where the generated views are well-supported by multi-view evidence versus
where they fall into regions of high uncertainty due to occlusion, lack of
texture, or direct inconsistency. This uncertainty signal directly guides the
optimization of a 3D Gaussian Splatting model via an uncertainty-weighted loss.
Our approach conditions the powerful generative prior on multi-view geometric
evidence, filtering hallucinatory artifacts while preserving plausible
completions in under-constrained regions, outperforming state-of-the-art
methods on datasets including Mip-NeRF 360 and NeRF Synthetic.

Abstract: Accurate monsoon rainfall prediction is vital for India's agriculture, water
management, and climate risk planning, yet remains challenging due to sparse
ground observations and complex regional variability. We present a multimodal
deep learning framework for high-resolution precipitation classification that
leverages satellite and Earth observation data. Unlike previous rainfall
prediction models based on coarse 5-50 km grids, we curate a new 1 km
resolution dataset for five Indian states, integrating seven key geospatial
modalities: land surface temperature, vegetation (NDVI), soil moisture,
relative humidity, wind speed, elevation, and land use, covering the
June-September 2024 monsoon season. Our approach uses an attention-guided U-Net
architecture to capture spatial patterns and temporal dependencies across
modalities, combined with focal and dice loss functions to handle rainfall
class imbalance defined by the India Meteorological Department (IMD).
Experiments demonstrate that our multimodal framework consistently outperforms
unimodal baselines and existing deep learning methods, especially in extreme
rainfall categories. This work contributes a scalable framework, benchmark
dataset, and state-of-the-art results for regional monsoon forecasting, climate
resilience, and geospatial AI applications in India.

Abstract: Domain-specific Visually Rich Document Understanding (VRDU) presents
significant challenges due to the complexity and sensitivity of documents in
fields such as medicine, finance, and material science. Existing Large
(Multimodal) Language Models (LLMs/MLLMs) achieve promising results but face
limitations such as hallucinations, inadequate domain adaptation, and reliance
on extensive fine-tuning datasets. This paper introduces SynDoc, a novel
framework that combines discriminative and generative models to address these
challenges. SynDoc employs a robust synthetic data generation workflow, using
structural information extraction and domain-specific query generation to
produce high-quality annotations. Through adaptive instruction tuning, SynDoc
improves the discriminative model's ability to extract domain-specific
knowledge. At the same time, a recursive inferencing mechanism iteratively
refines the output of both models for stable and accurate predictions. This
framework demonstrates scalable, efficient, and precise document understanding
and bridges the gap between domain-specific adaptation and general world
knowledge for document key information extraction tasks.

Motivation: 图像到视频生成模型的快速发展带来了显著风险，能够从静态图像合成视频并促进欺骗性或恶意内容的创建。现有防御方法如I2VGuard试图免疫图像，但有效且原则性的阻止运动的方法仍未充分探索。

Method: 提出Vid-Freeze方法，这是一种新颖的注意力抑制对抗攻击，通过向图像添加精心设计的对抗扰动，明确针对I2V模型的注意力机制。

Result: 实验证明该方法提供了令人印象深刻的保护效果，免疫后的图像生成静止或接近静态的视频，有效阻止恶意内容创建。

Conclusion: 注意力攻击是防止I2V生成模型滥用的稳健和主动防御的一个有前景方向。

Abstract: The rapid progress of image-to-video (I2V) generation models has introduced
significant risks, enabling video synthesis from static images and facilitating
deceptive or malicious content creation. While prior defenses such as I2VGuard
attempt to immunize images, effective and principled protection to block motion
remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce Vid-Freeze - a novel
attention-suppressing adversarial attack that adds carefully crafted
adversarial perturbations to images. Our method explicitly targets the
attention mechanism of I2V models, completely disrupting motion synthesis while
preserving semantic fidelity of the input image. The resulting immunized images
generate stand-still or near-static videos, effectively blocking malicious
content creation. Our experiments demonstrate the impressive protection
provided by the proposed approach, highlighting the importance of attention
attacks as a promising direction for robust and proactive defenses against
misuse of I2V generation models.

Conclusion: 基于散焦模糊的检测方法和可解释性工具为媒体取证研究做出了有意义的贡献，该方法具有鲁棒性和泛化性。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative AI has enabled the mass production of
photorealistic synthetic images, blurring the boundary between authentic and
fabricated visual content. This challenge is particularly evident in deepfake
scenarios involving facial manipulation, but also extends to broader
AI-generated content (AIGC) cases involving fully synthesized scenes. As such
content becomes increasingly difficult to distinguish from reality, the
integrity of visual media is under threat. To address this issue, we propose a
physically interpretable deepfake detection framework and demonstrate that
defocus blur can serve as an effective forensic signal. Defocus blur is a
depth-dependent optical phenomenon that naturally occurs in camera-captured
images due to lens focus and scene geometry. In contrast, synthetic images
often lack realistic depth-of-field (DoF) characteristics. To capture these
discrepancies, we construct a defocus blur map and use it as a discriminative
feature for detecting manipulated content. Unlike RGB textures or
frequency-domain signals, defocus blur arises universally from optical imaging
principles and encodes physical scene structure. This makes it a robust and
generalizable forensic cue. Our approach is supported by three in-depth feature
analyses, and experimental results confirm that defocus blur provides a
reliable and interpretable cue for identifying synthetic images. We aim for our
defocus-based detection pipeline and interpretability tools to contribute
meaningfully to ongoing research in media forensics. The implementation is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统脉冲相机重建方法在低光照高速场景下难以处理严重噪声和稀疏信息，需要新的解决方案

Method: 使用增强纹理间隔时间（ETFI）聚合稀疏信息，然后作为ControlNet的条件输入生成高速场景，并引入ETFI特征融合模块提升质量

Result: 在真实低光照脉冲流上表现出优越性能，建立了首个低光照脉冲流重建基准数据集

Conclusion: Diff-SPK通过利用生成先验有效补充低光照条件下的纹理信息，在低光照高速场景下具有显著优势

Abstract: Spike camera, a type of neuromorphic sensor with high-temporal resolution,
shows great promise for high-speed visual tasks. Unlike traditional cameras,
spike camera continuously accumulates photons and fires asynchronous spike
streams. Due to unique data modality, spike streams require reconstruction
methods to become perceptible to the human eye.
  However, lots of methods struggle to handle spike streams in low-light
high-speed scenarios due to severe noise and sparse information. In this work,
we propose Diff-SPK, the first diffusion-based reconstruction method for spike
camera. Diff-SPK effectively leverages generative priors to supplement texture
information in low-light conditions. Specifically, it first employs an
\textbf{E}nhanced \textbf{T}exture \textbf{f}rom Inter-spike \textbf{I}nterval
(ETFI) to aggregate sparse information from low-light spike streams. Then, ETFI
serves as a conditioning input for ControlNet to generate the high-speed
scenes. To improve the quality of results, we introduce an ETFI-based feature
fusion module during the generation process.
  Moreover, we establish the first bona fide benchmark for the low-light spike
stream reconstruction task. It significantly surpasses existing reconstruction
datasets in scale and provides quantitative illumination information. The
performance on real low-light spike streams demonstrates the superiority of
Diff-SPK.

Conclusion: 所提出的BDGF框架有效解决了多模态DDPM中的模态不平衡问题，并通过扩散特征引导的多分支网络实现了更好的土地覆盖分类效果

Abstract: Deep learning-based techniques for the analysis of multimodal remote sensing
data have become popular due to their ability to effectively integrate
complementary spatial, spectral, and structural information from different
sensors. Recently, denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) have
attracted attention in the remote sensing community due to their powerful
ability to capture robust and complex spatial-spectral distributions. However,
pre-training multimodal DDPMs may result in modality imbalance, and effectively
leveraging diffusion features to guide complementary diversity feature
extraction remains an open question. To address these issues, this paper
proposes a balanced diffusion-guided fusion (BDGF) framework that leverages
multimodal diffusion features to guide a multi-branch network for land-cover
classification. Specifically, we propose an adaptive modality masking strategy
to encourage the DDPMs to obtain a modality-balanced rather than spectral
image-dominated data distribution. Subsequently, these diffusion features
hierarchically guide feature extraction among CNN, Mamba, and transformer
networks by integrating feature fusion, group channel attention, and
cross-attention mechanisms. Finally, a mutual learning strategy is developed to
enhance inter-branch collaboration by aligning the probability entropy and
feature similarity of individual subnetworks. Extensive experiments on four
multimodal remote sensing datasets demonstrate that the proposed method
achieves superior classification performance. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型表面上具有文化能力，但实际上依赖肤浅的模式匹配而非真正的文化理解。需要评估模型的文化推理能力，而不仅仅是准确性指标。

Method: 引入诊断框架，通过分类和解释分析来探测视觉语言模型对火主题文化图像的理解。测试多个模型在西方节日、非西方传统和紧急场景上的表现。

Result: 模型存在系统性偏见：能正确识别突出的西方节日，但在代表性不足的文化事件上表现不佳，经常提供模糊标签或危险地将紧急情况误分类为庆祝活动。

Conclusion: 这些失败暴露了符号捷径的风险，强调了需要超越准确性指标的文化评估，以确保可解释和公平的多模态系统。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often appear culturally competent but rely on
superficial pattern matching rather than genuine cultural understanding. We
introduce a diagnostic framework to probe VLM reasoning on fire-themed cultural
imagery through both classification and explanation analysis. Testing multiple
models on Western festivals, non-Western traditions, and emergency scenes
reveals systematic biases: models correctly identify prominent Western
festivals but struggle with underrepresented cultural events, frequently
offering vague labels or dangerously misclassifying emergencies as
celebrations. These failures expose the risks of symbolic shortcuts and
highlight the need for cultural evaluation beyond accuracy metrics to ensure
interpretable and fair multimodal systems.

Motivation: 现实世界目标检测面临两个主要挑战：对未见类别的泛化能力差，以及在恶劣条件下的鲁棒性不足。现有研究分别处理这两个问题，但难以同时实现鲁棒性和多样性。

Method: 采用两阶段课程学习框架：第一阶段使用RGBT数据预训练增强鲁棒性，第二阶段通过视觉-语言对齐提高泛化能力。引入指数移动平均机制防止灾难性遗忘。

Result: 在FLIR数据集上达到80.1 AP50，在OV-COCO上达到48.6 AP50_Novel，在OV-LVIS上达到35.7 mAPr，在鲁棒性和多样性评估中都表现出竞争性性能。

Conclusion: C3-OWD成功统一了鲁棒性和泛化性的优势，通过课程式跨模态对比学习框架有效解决了目标检测中的关键挑战。

Abstract: Object detection has advanced significantly in the closed-set setting, but
real-world deployment remains limited by two challenges: poor generalization to
unseen categories and insufficient robustness under adverse conditions. Prior
research has explored these issues separately: visible-infrared detection
improves robustness but lacks generalization, while open-world detection
leverages vision-language alignment strategy for category diversity but
struggles under extreme environments. This trade-off leaves robustness and
diversity difficult to achieve simultaneously. To mitigate these issues, we
propose \textbf{C3-OWD}, a curriculum cross-modal contrastive learning
framework that unifies both strengths. Stage~1 enhances robustness by
pretraining with RGBT data, while Stage~2 improves generalization via
vision-language alignment. To prevent catastrophic forgetting between two
stages, we introduce an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) mechanism that
theoretically guarantees preservation of pre-stage performance with bounded
parameter lag and function consistency. Experiments on FLIR, OV-COCO, and
OV-LVIS demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach: C3-OWD achieves $80.1$
AP$^{50}$ on FLIR, $48.6$ AP$^{50}_{\text{Novel}}$ on OV-COCO, and $35.7$
mAP$_r$ on OV-LVIS, establishing competitive performance across both robustness
and diversity evaluations. Code available at:

Abstract: Remote sensing pansharpening aims to reconstruct spatial-spectral properties
during the fusion of panchromatic (PAN) images and low-resolution
multi-spectral (LR-MS) images, finally generating the high-resolution
multi-spectral (HR-MS) images. Although deep learning-based models have
achieved excellent performance, they often come with high computational
complexity, which hinder their applications on resource-limited devices. In
this paper, we explore the feasibility of applying the binary neural network
(BNN) to pan-sharpening. Nevertheless, there are two main issues with
binarizing pan-sharpening models: (i) the binarization will cause serious
spectral distortion due to the inconsistent spectral distribution of the
PAN/LR-MS images; (ii) the common binary convolution kernel is difficult to
adapt to the multi-scale and anisotropic spatial features of remote sensing
objects, resulting in serious degradation of contours. To address the above
issues, we design the customized spatial-spectral binarized convolution
(S2B-Conv), which is composed of the Spectral-Redistribution Mechanism (SRM)
and Gabor Spatial Feature Amplifier (GSFA). Specifically, SRM employs an affine
transformation, generating its scaling and bias parameters through a dynamic
learning process. GSFA, which randomly selects different frequencies and angles
within a preset range, enables to better handle multi-scale and-directional
spatial features. A series of S2B-Conv form a brand-new binary network for
pan-sharpening, dubbed as S2BNet. Extensive quantitative and qualitative
experiments have shown our high-efficiency binarized pan-sharpening method can
attain a promising performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型多模态模型在扩展推理链时过度依赖文本逻辑，逐渐失去对底层视觉信息的关注，导致推理路径偏离图像内容并产生错误结论。

Method: 采用无需训练的解耦视觉推理管道，由强大的LLM负责高层推理，策略性地询问LMM以提取特定视觉信息，LMM仅作为视觉问答引擎提供所需感知细节。

Result: 综合评估表明该框架能有效控制视觉推理过程，显著减少视觉无根据的推理步骤，大幅提升推理保真度。

Conclusion: 这种轻量级即插即用方法无需额外训练或架构修改，通过解耦推理和感知过程，成功解决了LMMs在长推理链中视觉信息丢失的问题。

Abstract: Significant advancements in the reasoning capabilities of Large Language
Models (LLMs) are now driven by test-time scaling laws, particularly those
leveraging extended Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. Inspired by these
breakthroughs, researchers have extended these paradigms to Large Multimodal
Models (LMMs). However, a critical limitation emerges: as their reasoning
chains extend, LMMs increasingly rely on textual logic, progressively losing
grounding in the underlying visual information. This leads to reasoning paths
that diverge from the image content, culminating in erroneous conclusions. To
address this, we introduce a strikingly simple yet effective training-free
visual-reasoning pipeline. The core concept is to decouple the reasoning and
perception processes. A powerful LLM orchestrates the high-level reasoning,
strategically interrogating a LMM to extract specific visual information
required for its logical chain. The LMM, in turn, functions exclusively as a
visual question-answering engine, supplying the necessary perceptual details on
demand. This lightweight, plug-and-play approach requires no additional
training or architectural changes. Comprehensive evaluations validate that our
framework effectively governs the visual reasoning process, leading to a
significant reduction in visually-unfounded reasoning steps and a substantial
improvement in reasoning fidelity.

TL;DR: 提出了Dual-Decoupled Prompting (DDP)框架，通过类别特定的正负提示词解耦语义，并使用渐进置信度解耦策略抑制假阳性，在无需重放的情况下显著提升了多标签类增量学习的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于提示的方法在单标签类增量学习中表现良好，但直接扩展到多标签类增量学习(MLCIL)时效果不佳，主要面临两个内在挑战：共现类别的语义混淆和部分标注导致的真负假正混淆。

Method: DDP框架包含两个核心组件：1) 类别特定的正负提示词来解耦语义；2) 渐进置信度解耦(PCD)策略，这是一种受课程学习启发的解耦方法，用于抑制假阳性。同时冻结历史提示词作为知识锚点，并通过层间提示提高效率。

Result: 在MS-COCO和PASCAL VOC数据集上的实验表明，DDP持续优于现有方法，并且在标准MS-COCO B40-C10基准测试中，首次实现了无需重放的MLCIL方法超过80% mAP和70% F1分数。

Conclusion: DDP框架成功解决了多标签类增量学习中的关键挑战，通过双重解耦机制有效处理了语义混淆和假阳性问题，为无需重放的多标签增量学习提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Prompt-based methods have shown strong effectiveness in single-label
class-incremental learning, but their direct extension to multi-label
class-incremental learning (MLCIL) performs poorly due to two intrinsic
challenges: semantic confusion from co-occurring categories and
true-negative-false-positive confusion caused by partial labeling. We propose
Dual-Decoupled Prompting (DDP), a replay-free and parameter-efficient framework
that explicitly addresses both issues. DDP assigns class-specific
positive-negative prompts to disentangle semantics and introduces Progressive
Confidence Decoupling (PCD), a curriculum-inspired decoupling strategy that
suppresses false positives. Past prompts are frozen as knowledge anchors, and
interlayer prompting enhances efficiency. On MS-COCO and PASCAL VOC, DDP
consistently outperforms prior methods and is the first replay-free MLCIL
approach to exceed 80% mAP and 70% F1 under the standard MS-COCO B40-C10
benchmark.

Motivation: 盲人脸恢复面临大解空间探索的固有挑战，导致恢复图像出现细节缺失和身份模糊等常见伪影。

Method: 提出LRPO框架，采用在线强化学习，包含三种关键策略：复合奖励函数、真实值引导的似然正则化和噪声级别优势分配。

Result: 大量实验表明，LRPO显著优于基线方法，在盲人脸恢复质量上达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: LRPO框架成功解决了盲人脸恢复中的挑战，通过强化学习实现了感知质量和保真度的良好平衡。

Abstract: Blind Face Restoration (BFR) encounters inherent challenges in exploring its
large solution space, leading to common artifacts like missing details and
identity ambiguity in the restored images. To tackle these challenges, we
propose a Likelihood-Regularized Policy Optimization (LRPO) framework, the
first to apply online reinforcement learning (RL) to the BFR task. LRPO
leverages rewards from sampled candidates to refine the policy network,
increasing the likelihood of high-quality outputs while improving restoration
performance on low-quality inputs. However, directly applying RL to BFR creates
incompatibility issues, producing restoration results that deviate
significantly from the ground truth. To balance perceptual quality and
fidelity, we propose three key strategies: 1) a composite reward function
tailored for face restoration assessment, 2) ground-truth guided likelihood
regularization, and 3) noise-level advantage assignment. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our proposed LRPO significantly improves the face restoration
quality over baseline methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: DentVLM是一个多模态视觉语言模型，专门用于口腔疾病诊断，在36个诊断任务中显著优于现有模型，并在临床研究中提升了牙医的诊断效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI模型在口腔医学中主要专注于单一任务，无法满足临床实践中复杂的多模态需求，需要开发能够综合处理多种成像模态的先进诊断工具。

Method: 使用包含110,447张图像和246万视觉问答对的双语大规模数据集开发DentVLM模型，能够解读7种2D口腔成像模态，涵盖36个诊断任务。

Result: DentVLM在口腔疾病诊断准确率上比领先模型高19.6%，错颌畸形诊断高27.9%。临床研究中，在36个任务中的21个任务上超越13名初级牙医，在12个任务上超越12名高级牙医，协作工作流可将初级牙医提升至高级水平，诊断时间减少15-22%。

Conclusion: DentVLM是一个强大的临床决策支持工具，能够提升初级牙科护理质量，缓解医患不平衡问题，并在牙科领域普及专业医疗知识。

Abstract: Diagnosing and managing oral diseases necessitate advanced visual
interpretation across diverse imaging modalities and integrated information
synthesis. While current AI models excel at isolated tasks, they often fall
short in addressing the complex, multimodal requirements of comprehensive
clinical dental practice. Here we introduce DentVLM, a multimodal
vision-language model engineered for expert-level oral disease diagnosis.
DentVLM was developed using a comprehensive, large-scale, bilingual dataset of
110,447 images and 2.46 million visual question-answering (VQA) pairs. The
model is capable of interpreting seven 2D oral imaging modalities across 36
diagnostic tasks, significantly outperforming leading proprietary and
open-source models by 19.6% higher accuracy for oral diseases and 27.9% for
malocclusions. In a clinical study involving 25 dentists, evaluating 1,946
patients and encompassing 3,105 QA pairs, DentVLM surpassed the diagnostic
performance of 13 junior dentists on 21 of 36 tasks and exceeded that of 12
senior dentists on 12 of 36 tasks. When integrated into a collaborative
workflow, DentVLM elevated junior dentists' performance to senior levels and
reduced diagnostic time for all practitioners by 15-22%. Furthermore, DentVLM
exhibited promising performance across three practical utility scenarios,
including home-based dental health management, hospital-based intelligent
diagnosis and multi-agent collaborative interaction. These findings establish
DentVLM as a robust clinical decision support tool, poised to enhance primary
dental care, mitigate provider-patient imbalances, and democratize access to
specialized medical expertise within the field of dentistry.

TL;DR: 提出了Dynamic-TreeRPO方法，通过树状结构搜索和动态噪声强度来改进文本到图像生成中的强化学习采样效率，结合LayerTuning-RL范式提升训练效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习在文本到图像生成中虽然提升了质量，但存在探索效率低、采样策略不高效的问题，特别是在采样组变化较小的情况下。

Method: 使用滑动窗口采样策略构建树状结构搜索，在树结构内进行GRPO引导优化和约束SDE采样，通过共享前缀路径分摊计算开销，并设计动态噪声强度增强探索多样性。

Result: 在HPS-v2.1、PickScore和ImageReward基准测试中分别超越现有最佳方法4.9%、5.91%和8.66%，同时训练效率提升近50%。

Conclusion: 树状结构采样和LayerTuning-RL范式能够动态探索多样化搜索空间，在语义一致性、视觉保真度和人类偏好对齐方面显著优于现有基线方法。

Abstract: The integration of Reinforcement Learning (RL) into flow matching models for
text-to-image (T2I) generation has driven substantial advances in generation
quality. However, these gains often come at the cost of exhaustive exploration
and inefficient sampling strategies due to slight variation in the sampling
group. Building on this insight, we propose Dynamic-TreeRPO, which implements
the sliding-window sampling strategy as a tree-structured search with dynamic
noise intensities along depth. We perform GRPO-guided optimization and
constrained Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) sampling within this tree
structure. By sharing prefix paths of the tree, our design effectively
amortizes the computational overhead of trajectory search. With well-designed
noise intensities for each tree layer, Dynamic-TreeRPO can enhance the
variation of exploration without any extra computational cost. Furthermore, we
seamlessly integrate Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and RL paradigm within
Dynamic-TreeRPO to construct our proposed LayerTuning-RL, reformulating the
loss function of SFT as a dynamically weighted Progress Reward Model (PRM)
rather than a separate pretraining method. By associating this weighted PRM
with dynamic-adaptive clipping bounds, the disruption of exploration process in
Dynamic-TreeRPO is avoided. Benefiting from the tree-structured sampling and
the LayerTuning-RL paradigm, our model dynamically explores a diverse search
space along effective directions. Compared to existing baselines, our approach
demonstrates significant superiority in terms of semantic consistency, visual
fidelity, and human preference alignment on established benchmarks, including
HPS-v2.1, PickScore, and ImageReward. In particular, our model outperforms SoTA
by $4.9\%$, $5.91\%$, and $8.66\%$ on those benchmarks, respectively, while
improving the training efficiency by nearly $50\%$.

*Lin Tian,Xiaoling Hu,Juan Eugenio Iglesias*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种测试时不确定性估计框架，可将任何预训练配准网络转化为风险感知工具，无需重新训练或架构修改


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度配准网络缺乏对其预测可靠性的指示，现有不确定性估计方法需要架构更改或重新训练，限制了在预训练网络中的应用

Method: 基于配准的变换等变性原理，通过分析网络在空间扰动下的预测方差，推导出扰动不确定性的理论分解，分离出内在扩展和偏差抖动两个分量

Result: 在四个解剖结构和多个配准模型上的实验表明，不确定性图与配准误差一致相关，并能突出需要谨慎处理的区域

Conclusion: 该框架使医学图像配准更接近在临床和大规模研究环境中的安全部署

Abstract: Accurate image registration is essential for downstream applications, yet
current deep registration networks provide limited indications of whether and
when their predictions are reliable. Existing uncertainty estimation
strategies, such as Bayesian methods, ensembles, or MC dropout, require
architectural changes or retraining, limiting their applicability to pretrained
registration networks. Instead, we propose a test-time uncertainty estimation
framework that is compatible with any pretrained networks. Our framework is
grounded in the transformation equivariance property of registration, which
states that the true mapping between two images should remain consistent under
spatial perturbations of the input. By analyzing the variance of network
predictions under such perturbations, we derive a theoretical decomposition of
perturbation-based uncertainty in registration. This decomposition separates
into two terms: (i) an intrinsic spread, reflecting epistemic noise, and (ii) a
bias jitter, capturing how systematic error drifts under perturbations. Across
four anatomical structures (brain, cardiac, abdominal, and lung) and multiple
registration models (uniGradICON, SynthMorph), the uncertainty maps correlate
consistently with registration errors and highlight regions requiring caution.
Our framework turns any pretrained registration network into a risk-aware tool
at test time, placing medical image registration one step closer to safe
deployment in clinical and large-scale research settings.

TL;DR: GRAPE是一种即插即用的增强方法，通过将排序信号整合到基于LLM的查询重写中，解决CLIP模型在分布偏移下的检索性能下降问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP模型在处理与训练语料分布不同的查询时表现不佳，现有基于LLM的查询重写方法缺乏监督信号，无法生成符合训练分布的最优查询。

Method: 提出GRAPE方法，使用GRPO将排序信号融入检索引导的查询重写，采用语料相对排序奖励来避免分数膨胀问题。

Result: 在多种分布偏移场景下（多语言、长度、多模态）都显著提升了检索性能，平均Recall@10提升了4.9%。

Conclusion: GRAPE通过将排序信号整合到查询重写中，有效缓解了CLIP模型在分布偏移下的性能下降问题。

Abstract: The CLIP model has become a cornerstone of large-scale retrieval systems by
aligning text and image data in a unified embedding space. Despite its
simplicity and efficiency, CLIP struggles when applied to tasks whose input
distributions diverge from its training corpus, such as queries with
multilingual, long-form, or multimodal differences. To avoid costly retraining,
existing methods mainly adopt query-rewriting strategies with large language
models (LLMs), aiming to mitigate distribution gaps at the query level.
However, due to the lack of supervision signals, LLMs fail to generate the
optimal one that fits the training distribution. We address this challenge with
GRAPE (Grouped Ranking-Aware Policy Optimization Enhancement), a plug-and-play
enhancement approach that incorporates ranking signals into retrieval-guided
query rewriting with LLMs. Intuitively, GRAPE proposes to leverage GRPO to
bridge distributional differences -- including length, multilingual, and
modality shifts -- by transforming queries into forms better aligned with the
retriever's training distribution. However, our preliminary experiment finds
that naively finetuning LLM with similarity scores can lead to score inflation,
where nearly all candidates are assigned unexpectedly high scores regardless of
their true relevance. To address score inflation, we propose a corpus-relative
ranking-based reward, which explicitly aligns optimization with ranking metrics
while suppressing spurious score inflation. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that GRAPE consistently improves retrieval performance under distributional
shifts -- including multilingual differences (Flickr30k-CN, CVLUE, XM3600),
length differences (Wikipedia), and multimodal differences (CIRR) -- achieving
an average improvement of 4.9\% in Recall\@10. The code is available at

TL;DR: CasPoinTr是一个使用级联网络和知识蒸馏的点云补全框架，通过两阶段协同处理解决不完整点云的形状预测和缺失区域重建问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中采集的点云通常由于传感器分辨率限制、单视角、遮挡和噪声等因素而不完整，这给点云补全任务带来了挑战，特别是从高度不完整的点云中预测整体形状和重建缺失区域。

Method: CasPoinTr将补全任务分解为两个协同阶段：形状重建阶段生成辅助信息，融合补全阶段利用这些信息和知识蒸馏生成最终输出。通过知识蒸馏，在更密集点云上训练的教师模型将不完整-完整关联知识传递给学生模型。

Result: 在ShapeNet-55数据集的不同难度设置下的实验表明，CasPoinTr在形状恢复和细节保留方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 级联结构和蒸馏策略有效增强了模型捕捉全局形状上下文和细化局部细节的能力，成功弥合了不完整输入与完整目标之间的差距。

Abstract: Point clouds collected from real-world environments are often incomplete due
to factors such as limited sensor resolution, single viewpoints, occlusions,
and noise. These challenges make point cloud completion essential for various
applications. A key difficulty in this task is predicting the overall shape and
reconstructing missing regions from highly incomplete point clouds. To address
this, we introduce CasPoinTr, a novel point cloud completion framework using
cascaded networks and knowledge distillation. CasPoinTr decomposes the
completion task into two synergistic stages: Shape Reconstruction, which
generates auxiliary information, and Fused Completion, which leverages this
information alongside knowledge distillation to generate the final output.
Through knowledge distillation, a teacher model trained on denser point clouds
transfers incomplete-complete associative knowledge to the student model,
enhancing its ability to estimate the overall shape and predict missing
regions. Together, the cascaded networks and knowledge distillation enhance the
model's ability to capture global shape context while refining local details,
effectively bridging the gap between incomplete inputs and complete targets.
Experiments on ShapeNet-55 under different difficulty settings demonstrate that
CasPoinTr outperforms existing methods in shape recovery and detail
preservation, highlighting the effectiveness of our cascaded structure and
distillation strategy.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniPose是一种统一跨模态姿态先验传播方法，通过自监督学习将2D人体姿态估计标注迁移到3D领域，无需3D关键点标注，使用RGB-D序列进行弱监督3D人体姿态估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决3D人体姿态估计需要大量人工标注3D关键点的问题，通过利用已有的2D姿态标注和易于获取的RGB-D序列，避免多视角相机标定和合成到真实数据迁移的问题。

Method: 使用现成的2D姿态估计作为点云网络的弱监督，结合时空约束（身体对称性和关节运动），通过2D到3D反投影损失和跨模态交互增强学习过程，采用锚点到关节预测方法在RGB和深度网络上进行3D提升。

Result: 在CMU Panoptic和ITOP数据集上的实验表明，UniPose达到了与全监督方法相当的性能，结合大规模未标注数据（如NTU RGB+D 60）在挑战性条件下进一步提升性能。

Conclusion: UniPose展示了在无需3D标注的情况下实现有效3D人体姿态估计的潜力，其提出的3D提升方法达到了最先进水平，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: In this paper, we present UniPose, a unified cross-modality pose prior
propagation method for weakly supervised 3D human pose estimation (HPE) using
unannotated single-view RGB-D sequences (RGB, depth, and point cloud data).
UniPose transfers 2D HPE annotations from large-scale RGB datasets (e.g., MS
COCO) to the 3D domain via self-supervised learning on easily acquired RGB-D
sequences, eliminating the need for labor-intensive 3D keypoint annotations.
This approach bridges the gap between 2D and 3D domains without suffering from
issues related to multi-view camera calibration or synthetic-to-real data
shifts. During training, UniPose leverages off-the-shelf 2D pose estimations as
weak supervision for point cloud networks, incorporating spatial-temporal
constraints like body symmetry and joint motion. The 2D-to-3D back-projection
loss and cross-modality interaction further enhance this process. By treating
the point cloud network's 3D HPE results as pseudo ground truth, our
anchor-to-joint prediction method performs 3D lifting on RGB and depth
networks, making it more robust against inaccuracies in 2D HPE results compared
to state-of-the-art methods. Experiments on CMU Panoptic and ITOP datasets show
that UniPose achieves comparable performance to fully supervised methods.
Incorporating large-scale unlabeled data (e.g., NTU RGB+D 60) enhances its
performance under challenging conditions, demonstrating its potential for
practical applications. Our proposed 3D lifting method also achieves
state-of-the-art results.

Motivation: 现有自接触数据集缺乏多样化的自接触姿态和精确的身体形状，限制了自接触姿态与形状之间关系的分析。需要解决自接触建模中身体形状的重要性问题。

Method: 1) 构建包含383K自接触姿态的Goliath-SC数据集；2) 提出基于身体部位潜在扩散和自注意力机制的条件生成模型；3) 将该先验融入单视角姿态估计并精炼接触姿态。

Result: 实验表明形状条件对于成功建模自接触姿态分布至关重要，能够显著改进单视角姿态估计在自接触场景下的性能。

Conclusion: 身体形状条件是自接触建模的关键因素，提出的方法有效提升了自接触姿态的生成和估计质量。

Abstract: One can hardly model self-contact of human poses without considering
underlying body shapes. For example, the pose of rubbing a belly for a person
with a low BMI leads to penetration of the hand into the belly for a person
with a high BMI. Despite its relevance, existing self-contact datasets lack the
variety of self-contact poses and precise body shapes, limiting conclusive
analysis between self-contact poses and shapes. To address this, we begin by
introducing the first extensive self-contact dataset with precise body shape
registration, Goliath-SC, consisting of 383K self-contact poses across 130
subjects. Using this dataset, we propose generative modeling of self-contact
prior conditioned by body shape parameters, based on a body-part-wise latent
diffusion with self-attention. We further incorporate this prior into
single-view human pose estimation while refining estimated poses to be in
contact. Our experiments suggest that shape conditioning is vital to the
successful modeling of self-contact pose distribution, hence improving
single-view pose estimation in self-contact.

Motivation: 现有的驾驶场景生成方法主要关注合成多样化和高保真的驾驶视频，但由于3D一致性有限和稀疏视角覆盖，难以支持便捷高质量的新视角合成。而3D/4D重建方法虽然改进了真实驾驶场景的新视角合成，但缺乏生成能力。

Method: 1. 引入4D感知潜在扩散模型，整合多模态信息以前馈方式生成像素对齐的4D高斯；2. 使用增强的视频扩散模型对这些高斯渲染的新视角视频进行细化。

Result: 在基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，WorldSplat能够有效生成高保真、时空一致的多轨迹新视角驾驶视频。

Conclusion: WorldSplat成功解决了场景生成与重建之间的困境，为自动驾驶系统提供了可扩展和可控的训练数据生成能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in driving-scene generation and reconstruction have
demonstrated significant potential for enhancing autonomous driving systems by
producing scalable and controllable training data. Existing generation methods
primarily focus on synthesizing diverse and high-fidelity driving videos;
however, due to limited 3D consistency and sparse viewpoint coverage, they
struggle to support convenient and high-quality novel-view synthesis (NVS).
Conversely, recent 3D/4D reconstruction approaches have significantly improved
NVS for real-world driving scenes, yet inherently lack generative capabilities.
To overcome this dilemma between scene generation and reconstruction, we
propose \textbf{WorldSplat}, a novel feed-forward framework for 4D
driving-scene generation. Our approach effectively generates consistent
multi-track videos through two key steps: ((i)) We introduce a 4D-aware latent
diffusion model integrating multi-modal information to produce pixel-aligned 4D
Gaussians in a feed-forward manner. ((ii)) Subsequently, we refine the novel
view videos rendered from these Gaussians using a enhanced video diffusion
model. Extensive experiments conducted on benchmark datasets demonstrate that
\textbf{WorldSplat} effectively generates high-fidelity, temporally and
spatially consistent multi-track novel view driving videos.

Abstract: Fracture detection plays a critical role in medical imaging analysis,
traditional fracture diagnosis relies on visual assessment by experienced
physicians, however the speed and accuracy of this approach are constrained by
the expertise. With the rapid advancements in artificial intelligence, deep
learning models based on the YOLO framework have been widely employed for
fracture detection, demonstrating significant potential in improving diagnostic
efficiency and accuracy. This study proposes an improved YOLO-based model,
termed Fracture-YOLO, which integrates novel Critical-Region-Selector Attention
(CRSelector) and Scale-Aware (ScA) heads to further enhance detection
performance. Specifically, the CRSelector module utilizes global texture
information to focus on critical features of fracture regions. Meanwhile, the
ScA module dynamically adjusts the weights of features at different scales,
enhancing the model's capacity to identify fracture targets at multiple scales.
Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to the baseline model,

Abstract: In this paper, an advanced fracture detection framework, FracDetNet, is
proposed to address challenges in medical imaging, as accurate fracture
detection is essential for enhancing diagnostic efficiency in clinical

detecting subtle and morphologically diverse fractures due to variable imaging
angles and suboptimal image quality. To overcome these limitations, FracDetNet
integrates Dual-Focus Attention (DFA) and Multi-scale Calibration (MC).
Specifically, the DFA module effectively captures detailed local features and
comprehensive global context through combined global and local attention
mechanisms. Additionally, the MC adaptively refines feature representations to
enhance detection performance. Experimental evaluations on the publicly

TL;DR: SPIKE是一个推理时框架，通过量化贝叶斯惊喜来识别视频中的关键时刻，并基于惊喜权重进行帧采样，在多个下游基准测试中优于均匀采样。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界视频通常包含常规活动和令人难忘的意外事件，但现有Video-LLMs通过均匀采样帧处理视频，很可能错过定义视频叙事的关键时刻。

Method: 引入SPIKE框架量化贝叶斯惊喜作为视频流中新视觉证据触发的信念更新，识别新视觉证据与先验信念冲突的时刻。开发SPIKE-RL使用GRPO优化基于视频字幕奖励信号的信念假设。

Result: SPIKE能有效定位视频中的惊喜时刻，与人类在正面(FunQA)和负面(Oops!)惊喜基准上高度相关。惊喜加权帧采样在五个下游基准测试中持续优于均匀采样。

Conclusion: 通过让Video-LLMs跟踪信念并注册惊喜，我们的工作为更鲁棒的模型铺平了道路，这些模型能够根据新信息修正其理解。

Abstract: Real-world videos often show routine activities punctuated by memorable,
surprising events. However, most Video-LLMs process videos by sampling frames
uniformly, likely missing critical moments that define a video's narrative. We
introduce SPIKE, an inference-time framework that quantifies Bayesian Surprise
as the belief update triggered by new visual evidence in the video stream,
identifying moments where new visual evidence conflicts with prior beliefs.
SPIKE effectively localizes surprise in videos, strongly correlated with humans
on positive (FunQA) and negative (Oops!) surprise benchmarks. Since the beliefs
of zero-shot Video-LLMs are often suboptimal, we develop SPIKE-RL, which
leverages GRPO to optimize belief hypotheses based on a reward signal from the
video caption. SPIKE and SPIKE-RL guide query-agnostic surprise-weighted frame
sampling, which allocates more frames to interesting moments in the video. With
this strategy, we achieve consistent performance gains on five downstream
benchmarks over uniform sampling. By enabling Video-LLMs to track beliefs and
register surprise, our work paves the way for more robust models that can
revise their understanding in response to new information.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于周期性激活的隐式神经表示网络存在隐藏特征冗余问题，由于使用固定频率乘子导致层内神经元捕获重叠的频率成分，限制了多层感知器的表达能力。

Method: 受离散正弦变换启发，为周期性激活分配基于奈奎斯特频率的神经元特定频率乘子，在不增加网络深度或超参数调优的情况下引入频率多样性。

Result: 将特征冗余减少近50%，在1D音频、2D图像、3D形状拟合和神经辐射场合成等任务中持续提升信号重建性能，优于基线方法且保持效率。

Conclusion: 这种简单而原则性的修改能有效减少特征冗余，提高隐式神经表示的表达能力，在各种任务中实现更好的重建效果。

Abstract: Existing periodic activation-based implicit neural representation (INR)
networks, such as SIREN and FINER, suffer from hidden feature redundancy, where
neurons within a layer capture overlapping frequency components due to the use
of a fixed frequency multiplier. This redundancy limits the expressive capacity
of multilayer perceptrons (MLPs). Drawing inspiration from classical signal
processing methods such as the Discrete Sine Transform (DST), we propose
FM-SIREN and FM-FINER, which assign Nyquist-informed, neuron-specific frequency
multipliers to periodic activations. Unlike existing approaches, our design
introduces frequency diversity without requiring hyperparameter tuning or
additional network depth. This simple yet principled modification reduces the
redundancy of features by nearly 50% and consistently improves signal
reconstruction across diverse INR tasks, including fitting 1D audio, 2D image
and 3D shape, and synthesis of neural radiance fields (NeRF), outperforming
their baseline counterparts while maintaining efficiency.

Conclusion: FoR-SALE成功将参照系概念整合到多模态模型中，显著提升了空间描述的理解和生成能力

Abstract: Frame of Reference (FoR) is a fundamental concept in spatial reasoning that
humans utilize to comprehend and describe space. With the rapid progress in
Multimodal Language models, the moment has come to integrate this
long-overlooked dimension into these models. In particular, in text-to-image
(T2I) generation, even state-of-the-art models exhibit a significant
performance gap when spatial descriptions are provided from perspectives other
than the camera. To address this limitation, we propose Frame of
Reference-guided Spatial Adjustment in LLM-based Diffusion Editing (FoR-SALE),
an extension of the Self-correcting LLM-controlled Diffusion (SLD) framework
for T2I. For-Sale evaluates the alignment between a given text and an initially
generated image, and refines the image based on the Frame of Reference
specified in the spatial expressions. It employs vision modules to extract the
spatial configuration of the image, while simultaneously mapping the spatial
expression to a corresponding camera perspective. This unified perspective
enables direct evaluation of alignment between language and vision. When
misalignment is detected, the required editing operations are generated and
applied. FoR-SALE applies novel latent-space operations to adjust the facing
direction and depth of the generated images. We evaluate FoR-SALE on two
benchmarks specifically designed to assess spatial understanding with FoR. Our
framework improves the performance of state-of-the-art T2I models by up to 5.3%
using only a single round of correction.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 3DPCNet是一个紧凑的模块，可将单目3D姿态估计器产生的相机中心骨架转换为身体中心的规范坐标系，消除视角依赖性，便于运动分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单目3D姿态估计器产生的相机中心骨架存在视角依赖性，这给健康监测和运动科学等应用中的比较分析带来困难。

Method: 使用混合编码器融合图卷积网络的局部骨骼特征和transformer的全局上下文，通过门控交叉注意力机制预测6D旋转并将其映射到SO(3)矩阵来对齐姿态。在MM-Fi数据集上使用合成旋转姿态进行自监督训练。

Result: 在MM-Fi基准测试中，将平均旋转误差从超过20°降低到3.4°，平均每关节位置误差从约64mm降低到47mm。在TotalCapture数据集上的定性评估显示，从视频中提取的加速度信号与地面真实IMU传感器数据具有强视觉对应性。

Conclusion: 3DPCNet能够有效消除视角变异性，实现物理上合理的运动分析，为基于视频的运动监测提供了可靠的工具。

Abstract: Monocular 3D pose estimators produce camera-centered skeletons, creating
view-dependent kinematic signals that complicate comparative analysis in
applications such as health and sports science. We present 3DPCNet, a compact,
estimator-agnostic module that operates directly on 3D joint coordinates to
rectify any input pose into a consistent, body-centered canonical frame. Its
hybrid encoder fuses local skeletal features from a graph convolutional network
with global context from a transformer via a gated cross-attention mechanism.
From this representation, the model predicts a continuous 6D rotation that is
mapped to an $SO(3)$ matrix to align the pose. We train the model in a
self-supervised manner on the MM-Fi dataset using synthetically rotated poses,
guided by a composite loss ensuring both accurate rotation and pose
reconstruction. On the MM-Fi benchmark, 3DPCNet reduces the mean rotation error
from over 20$^{\circ}$ to 3.4$^{\circ}$ and the Mean Per Joint Position Error
from ~64 mm to 47 mm compared to a geometric baseline. Qualitative evaluations
on the TotalCapture dataset further demonstrate that our method produces
acceleration signals from video that show strong visual correspondence to
ground-truth IMU sensor data, confirming that our module removes viewpoint
variability to enable physically plausible motion analysis.

Conclusion: 提出的细粒度测试时优化框架有效提升了文本到图像生成的组合忠实度，通过概念级评估和迭代提示优化实现了更好的概念覆盖。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) models, they often fail to
faithfully render all elements of complex prompts, frequently omitting or
misrepresenting specific objects and attributes. Test-time optimization has
emerged as a promising approach to address this limitation by refining
generation without the need for retraining. In this paper, we propose a
fine-grained test-time optimization framework that enhances compositional
faithfulness in T2I generation. Unlike most of prior approaches that rely
solely on a global image/text similarity score, our method decomposes the input
prompt into semantic concepts and evaluates alignment at both the global and
concept levels. A fine-grained variant of CLIP is used to compute concept-level
correspondence, producing detailed feedback on missing or inaccurate concepts.
This feedback is fed into an iterative prompt refinement loop, enabling the
large language model to propose improved prompts. Experiments on DrawBench and
CompBench prompts demonstrate that our method significantly improves concept
coverage and human-judged faithfulness over both standard test-time
optimization and the base T2I model. Code is available at:

Result: 大量实验证明MFAS-DANet在域自适应场景下具有有效性和最先进的性能。

Conclusion: MFAS-DANet成功解决了多模态人脸反欺诈在域自适应中的关键挑战，为实际应用提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Recent multi-modal face anti-spoofing (FAS) methods have investigated the
potential of leveraging multiple modalities to distinguish live and spoof
faces. However, pre-adapted multi-modal FAS models often fail to detect unseen
attacks from new target domains. Although a more realistic domain adaptation
(DA) scenario has been proposed for single-modal FAS to learn specific spoof
attacks during inference, DA remains unexplored in multi-modal FAS methods. In
this paper, we propose a novel framework, MFAS-DANet, to address three major
challenges in multi-modal FAS under the DA scenario: missing modalities, noisy
pseudo labels, and model degradation. First, to tackle the issue of missing
modalities, we propose extracting complementary features from other modalities
to substitute missing modality features or enhance existing ones. Next, to
reduce the impact of noisy pseudo labels during model adaptation, we propose
deriving reliable pseudo labels by leveraging prediction uncertainty across
different modalities. Finally, to prevent model degradation, we design an
adaptive mechanism that decreases the loss weight during unstable adaptations
and increasing it during stable ones. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness and state-of-the-art performance of our proposed MFAS-DANet.

TL;DR: RestoRect是一种新颖的潜在整流流特征蒸馏方法，通过将特征蒸馏重新表述为生成过程，让学生学习在潜在空间中合成教师质量的特征，解决了图像修复中性能与速度的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前图像修复方法面临关键权衡：高性能模型太慢不实用，而快速模型效果差。现有静态特征匹配方法无法捕捉现代transformer架构动态生成特征的方式。

Method: 应用整流流将特征蒸馏重新表述为生成过程，结合Retinex理论进行物理分解、可学习各向异性扩散约束和三角色彩空间极化，引入特征层提取损失实现不同网络架构间的鲁棒知识转移。

Result: 在15个图像修复数据集、4个任务、8个指标上展示了优越结果，实现了更好的训练稳定性、更快的收敛和推理速度，同时保持修复质量。

Conclusion: RestoRect通过整流流特征蒸馏方法有效解决了图像修复中性能与速度的权衡问题，在多个数据集和任务上表现出色。

Abstract: Current approaches for restoration of degraded images face a critical
trade-off: high-performance models are too slow for practical use, while fast
models produce poor results. Knowledge distillation transfers teacher knowledge
to students, but existing static feature matching methods cannot capture how
modern transformer architectures dynamically generate features. We propose
'RestoRect', a novel Latent Rectified Flow Feature Distillation method for
restoring degraded images. We apply rectified flow to reformulate feature
distillation as a generative process where students learn to synthesize
teacher-quality features through learnable trajectories in latent space. Our
framework combines Retinex theory for physics-based decomposition with
learnable anisotropic diffusion constraints, and trigonometric color space
polarization. We introduce a Feature Layer Extraction loss for robust knowledge
transfer between different network architectures through cross-normalized
transformer feature alignment with percentile-based outlier detection.
RestoRect achieves better training stability, and faster convergence and
inference while preserving restoration quality. We demonstrate superior results
across 15 image restoration datasets, covering 4 tasks, on 8 metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法基于低秩假设，难以建模无约束动态场景中复杂的区域特定变形。OriGS旨在通过场景方向提供稳定的结构指导来解决这一问题。

Method: 首先估计全局方向场，传播主要前进方向；然后提出方向感知超高斯，将时间、空间、几何和方向嵌入到统一的概率状态中，通过条件切片推断区域特定变形。

Result: 实验表明，OriGS在具有挑战性的真实世界动态场景中，相比主流方法具有更优越的重建保真度。

Conclusion: OriGS通过方向锚定的高斯分布方法，有效解决了复杂动态场景的4D重建问题，实现了高质量的重建效果。

Abstract: We present Orientation-anchored Gaussian Splatting (OriGS), a novel framework
for high-quality 4D reconstruction from casually captured monocular videos.
While recent advances extend 3D Gaussian Splatting to dynamic scenes via
various motion anchors, such as graph nodes or spline control points, they
often rely on low-rank assumptions and fall short in modeling complex,
region-specific deformations inherent to unconstrained dynamics. OriGS
addresses this by introducing a hyperdimensional representation grounded in
scene orientation. We first estimate a Global Orientation Field that propagates
principal forward directions across space and time, serving as stable
structural guidance for dynamic modeling. Built upon this, we propose
Orientation-aware Hyper-Gaussian, a unified formulation that embeds time,
space, geometry, and orientation into a coherent probabilistic state. This
enables inferring region-specific deformation through principled conditioned
slicing, adaptively capturing diverse local dynamics in alignment with global
motion intent. Experiments demonstrate the superior reconstruction fidelity of
OriGS over mainstream methods in challenging real-world dynamic scenes.

TL;DR: 该论文通过大规模实证研究分析了23个视觉问答基准中模态依赖性的特征，发现许多旨在减少文本偏见的基准反而放大了图像依赖性，且大型模型可能通过单模态依赖来掩盖多模态推理能力的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解模态内依赖（单个模态对目标任务的贡献）和模态间依赖（模态与目标任务之间的关系）对于推进多模态学习至关重要，但目前基准评估中这些依赖性的性质和相互作用仍缺乏系统表征。

Method: 使用多模态大语言模型在23个视觉问答基准上进行大规模实证研究，涵盖通用知识推理、专家知识推理、光学字符识别和文档理解等领域。

Result: 研究发现视觉、文本及其相互作用的依赖程度在不同基准间和基准内存在显著差异；许多旨在缓解文本偏见的基准无意中增强了图像依赖性；这种特征在不同模型规模中持续存在，大型模型常利用单模态依赖实现高性能，掩盖了多模态推理能力的不足。

Conclusion: 研究提供了多模态数据集的定量表征，为多模态基准设计和评估提供了原则性方法。

Abstract: Understanding the interplay between intra-modality dependencies (the
contribution of an individual modality to a target task) and inter-modality
dependencies (the relationships between modalities and the target task) is
fundamental to advancing multi-modal learning. However, the nature of and
interaction between these dependencies within current benchmark evaluations
remains poorly characterized. In this work, we present a large-scale empirical
study to quantify these dependencies across 23 visual question-answering
benchmarks using multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) covering domains
such as general and expert knowledge reasoning, optical character recognition,
and document understanding. Our findings show that the reliance on vision,
question (text), and their interaction varies significantly, both across and
within benchmarks. We discover that numerous benchmarks intended to mitigate
text-only biases have inadvertently amplified image-only dependencies. This
characterization persists across model sizes, as larger models often use these
intra-modality dependencies to achieve high performance that mask an underlying
lack of multi-modal reasoning. We provide a quantitative characterization of
multi-modal datasets, enabling a principled approach to multi-modal benchmark
design and evaluation.

Conclusion: 该方法为息肉分割提供了鲁棒且适应性强的解决方案，在临床和自动化诊断系统中具有应用前景。

Abstract: Polyp segmentation is a critical step in colorectal cancer detection, yet it
remains challenging due to the diverse shapes, sizes, and low contrast
boundaries of polyps in medical imaging. In this work, we propose a novel
framework that improves segmentation accuracy and efficiency by integrating a
Dynamic Kernel (DK) mechanism with a global Encoder Attention module. The DK
mechanism, initialized by a global context vector from the EA module,
iteratively refines segmentation predictions across decoding stages, enabling
the model to focus on and accurately delineate complex polyp boundaries. The EA
module enhances the network's ability to capture critical lesion features by
aggregating multi scale information from all encoder layers. In addition, we
employ Unified Channel Adaptation (UCA) in the decoder to standardize feature
dimensions across stages, ensuring consistent and computationally efficient
information fusion. Our approach extends the lesion-aware kernel framework by
introducing a more flexible, attention driven kernel initialization and a
unified decoder design. Extensive experiments on the KvasirSEG and CVC ClinicDB
benchmark datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms several state of the
art segmentation methods, achieving superior Dice and Intersection over Union
scores. Moreover, UCA simplifies the decoder structure, reducing computational
cost without compromising accuracy. Overall, the proposed method provides a
robust and adaptable solution for polyp segmentation, with promising
applications in clinical and automated diagnostic systems.

Method: 创建ActPLD基准测试，使用单人和社交互动的点光源显示数据，评估包括最先进的专有和开源模型在内的多个系统。

Result: 所有测试模型在点光源显示的动作理解任务上表现一致较差，揭示了在动作和时空理解方面的基本差距。

Conclusion: 当前的多模态大语言模型在从稀疏视觉线索理解人类动作方面存在显著局限，需要进一步改进以接近人类的具身理解能力。

Abstract: Humans can extract rich semantic information from minimal visual cues, as
demonstrated by point-light displays (PLDs), which consist of sparse sets of
dots localized to key joints of the human body. This ability emerges early in
development and is largely attributed to human embodied experience. Since PLDs
isolate body motion as the sole source of meaning, they represent key stimuli
for testing the constraints of action understanding in these systems. Here we
introduce ActPLD, the first benchmark to evaluate action processing in MLLMs
from human PLDs. Tested models include state-of-the-art proprietary and
open-source systems on single-actor and socially interacting PLDs. Our results
reveal consistently low performance across models, introducing fundamental gaps
in action and spatiotemporal understanding.

Abstract: Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality
in systemic sclerosis (SSc). Chest computed tomography (CT) is the primary
imaging modality for diagnosing and monitoring lung complications in SSc
patients. However, its role in disease progression and mortality prediction has
not yet been fully clarified. This study introduces a novel, large-scale
longitudinal chest CT analysis framework that utilizes radiomics and deep
learning to predict mortality associated with lung complications of SSc. We
collected and analyzed 2,125 CT scans from SSc patients enrolled in the
Northwestern Scleroderma Registry, conducting mortality analyses at one, three,
and five years using advanced imaging analysis techniques. Death labels were
assigned based on recorded deaths over the one-, three-, and five-year
intervals, confirmed by expert physicians. In our dataset, 181, 326, and 428 of
the 2,125 CT scans were from patients who died within one, three, and five
years, respectively. Using ResNet-18, DenseNet-121, and Swin Transformer we use
pre-trained models, and fine-tuned on 2,125 images of SSc patients. Models
achieved an AUC of 0.769, 0.801, 0.709 for predicting mortality within one-,
three-, and five-years, respectively. Our findings highlight the potential of
both radiomics and deep learning computational methods to improve early
detection and risk assessment of SSc-related interstitial lung disease, marking

Conclusion: 虽然低分辨率训练的视频模型作为通用基线表现良好，但我们的自适应框架代表了安全关键应用中可靠性至关重要的最先进解决方案。

Abstract: Driver monitoring systems require not just high accuracy but reliable,
well-calibrated confidence scores for safety-critical deployment. While direct
low-resolution training yields high overall accuracy, it produces poorly
calibrated predictions that can be dangerous in safety-critical scenarios. We
propose a resource-aware adaptive super-resolution framework that optimizes for

achieves state-of-the-art performance on safety-centric metrics: best
calibration (ECE of 5.8\% vs 6.2\% for LR-trained baselines), highest AUPR for
drowsiness detection (0.78 vs 0.74), and superior precision-recall for phone
use detection (0.74 vs 0.71). A lightweight artifact detector (0.3M parameters,
5.2ms overhead) provides additional safety by filtering SR-induced

Motivation: 为了解决开放词汇3D实例分割中标注成本高和3D重建模型几何细节过平滑的问题，提出直接从2D视频重建场景，利用2D感知模型生成3D标注。

Method: 1. 利用3D重建模型的2D-3D对应关系，将2D实例掩码投影到3D生成标注；2. 提出视图实例分区算法避免错误监督；3. 引入2D实例边界感知超点聚类方法。

Result: 在ScanNet200基准测试上整体提升+2.3 mAP，在标准开放词汇设置下，新类别性能超越先前方法约+7.1 mAP，显著缩小了尾类和头类之间的性能差距。

Conclusion: OVSeg3R成功将最先进的封闭词汇3D实例分割模型扩展到开放词汇，通过利用2D感知模型和创新的训练策略，显著提升了3D实例分割性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a training scheme called OVSeg3R to learn
open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation from well-studied 2D perception models
with the aid of 3D reconstruction. OVSeg3R directly adopts reconstructed scenes
from 2D videos as input, avoiding costly manual adjustment while aligning input
with real-world applications. By exploiting the 2D to 3D correspondences
provided by 3D reconstruction models, OVSeg3R projects each view's 2D instance
mask predictions, obtained from an open-vocabulary 2D model, onto 3D to
generate annotations for the view's corresponding sub-scene. To avoid
incorrectly introduced false positives as supervision due to partial
annotations from 2D to 3D, we propose a View-wise Instance Partition algorithm,
which partitions predictions to their respective views for supervision,
stabilizing the training process. Furthermore, since 3D reconstruction models
tend to over-smooth geometric details, clustering reconstructed points into
representative super-points based solely on geometry, as commonly done in
mainstream 3D segmentation methods, may overlook geometrically non-salient
objects. We therefore introduce 2D Instance Boundary-aware Superpoint, which
leverages 2D masks to constrain the superpoint clustering, preventing
superpoints from violating instance boundaries. With these designs, OVSeg3R not
only extends a state-of-the-art closed-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation
model to open-vocabulary, but also substantially narrows the performance gap
between tail and head classes, ultimately leading to an overall improvement of
+2.3 mAP on the ScanNet200 benchmark. Furthermore, under the standard
open-vocabulary setting, OVSeg3R surpasses previous methods by about +7.1 mAP
on the novel classes, further validating its effectiveness.

Abstract: Neural scene representations such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D
Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have transformed how 3D environments are modeled,
rendered, and interpreted. NeRF introduced view-consistent photorealism via
volumetric rendering; 3DGS has rapidly emerged as an explicit, efficient
alternative that supports high-quality rendering, faster optimization, and
integration into hybrid pipelines for enhanced photorealism and task-driven
scene understanding. This survey examines how 3DGS is being adopted across
SLAM, telepresence and teleoperation, robotic manipulation, and 3D content
generation. Despite their differences, these domains share common goals:
photorealistic rendering, meaningful 3D structure, and accurate downstream
tasks. We organize the review around unified research questions that explain
why 3DGS is increasingly displacing NeRF-based approaches: What technical
advantages drive its adoption? How does it adapt to different input modalities
and domain-specific constraints? What limitations remain? By systematically
comparing domain-specific pipelines, we show that 3DGS balances photorealism,
geometric fidelity, and computational efficiency. The survey offers a roadmap
for leveraging neural rendering not only for image synthesis but also for
perception, interaction, and content creation across real and virtual
environments.

TL;DR: 首个用于MRI胰腺分区（头、体、尾）分割的联邦学习方法，通过隐私保护框架在7个医疗机构协作训练，解决了胰腺分割的技术复杂性和数据稀缺问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胰腺疾病具有明显的区域异质性（癌症多发生在头部，慢性胰腺炎导致尾部组织损失），准确分割胰腺区域对于精确诊断和治疗规划至关重要，但MRI中由于形态多变、软组织对比度差和解剖变异而极具挑战性。

Method: 提出隐私保护的联邦学习框架，在7个医疗机构间协作训练而不共享数据，使用711个T1W和726个T2W MRI扫描。评估了三种分割架构（U-Net、Attention U-Net、Swin UNETR）与两种FL算法（FedAvg、FedProx）的组合，并设计了基于解剖学知识的损失函数。

Result: 发现Attention U-Net与FedAvg组合对胰腺异质性处理最优，该方法在分布式异构数据集上实现了临床可行的性能。

Conclusion: 该联邦学习方法成功解决了胰腺分区分割的技术挑战，为多中心医疗数据协作提供了有效解决方案，具有重要的临床应用价值。

Abstract: We present the first federated learning (FL) approach for pancreas part(head,
body and tail) segmentation in MRI, addressing a critical clinical challenge as
a significant innovation. Pancreatic diseases exhibit marked regional
heterogeneity cancers predominantly occur in the head region while chronic
pancreatitis causes tissue loss in the tail, making accurate segmentation of
the organ into head, body, and tail regions essential for precise diagnosis and
treatment planning. This segmentation task remains exceptionally challenging in
MRI due to variable morphology, poor soft-tissue contrast, and anatomical
variations across patients. Our novel contribution tackles two fundamental
challenges: first, the technical complexity of pancreas part delineation in
MRI, and second the data scarcity problem that has hindered prior approaches.
We introduce a privacy-preserving FL framework that enables collaborative model
training across seven medical institutions without direct data sharing,
leveraging a diverse dataset of 711 T1W and 726 T2W MRI scans. Our key
innovations include: (1) a systematic evaluation of three state-of-the-art
segmentation architectures (U-Net, Attention U-Net,Swin UNETR) paired with two
FL algorithms (FedAvg, FedProx), revealing Attention U-Net with FedAvg as
optimal for pancreatic heterogeneity, which was never been done before; (2) a
novel anatomically-informed loss function prioritizing region-specific texture
contrasts in MRI. Comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that our approach
achieves clinically viable performance despite training on distributed,
heterogeneous datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇综述系统回顾了自动驾驶中拓扑感知感知的四个核心研究方向：矢量化地图构建、拓扑结构建模、先验知识融合和基于语言模型的感知，揭示了从静态预建地图到动态传感器驱动感知的范式转变。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统静态地图构建成本高、难以实时更新且缺乏跨区域泛化能力，限制了自动驾驶系统的可扩展性。需要转向动态、实时的环境感知方法。

Method: 通过四个研究方向实现范式转变：紧凑空间建模（矢量化地图）、语义关系推理（拓扑结构）、鲁棒领域知识集成（先验融合）和预训练语言模型驱动的多模态场景理解。

Result: 这些方法共同推动了从静态地图到动态感知的转变，实现了实时地图构建和拓扑推理。

Conclusion: 这些研究方向为构建更自适应、可扩展和可解释的自动驾驶系统铺平了道路。

Abstract: The key to achieving autonomous driving lies in topology-aware perception,
the structured understanding of the driving environment with an emphasis on
lane topology and road semantics. This survey systematically reviews four core
research directions under this theme: vectorized map construction, topological
structure modeling, prior knowledge fusion, and language model-based
perception. Across these directions, we observe a unifying trend: a paradigm
shift from static, pre-built maps to dynamic, sensor-driven perception.
Specifically, traditional static maps have provided semantic context for
autonomous systems. However, they are costly to construct, difficult to update
in real time, and lack generalization across regions, limiting their
scalability. In contrast, dynamic representations leverage on-board sensor data
for real-time map construction and topology reasoning. Each of the four
research directions contributes to this shift through compact spatial modeling,
semantic relational reasoning, robust domain knowledge integration, and
multimodal scene understanding powered by pre-trained language models.
Together, they pave the way for more adaptive, scalable, and explainable
autonomous driving systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出NeuroAdapter框架，直接基于脑信号表征进行视觉解码，无需中间特征空间，在保持重建质量的同时提供更好的生成过程透明度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法通过将脑信号映射到中间图像或文本特征空间来指导生成过程，这掩盖了不同脑区对最终重建输出的贡献。

Method: 开发NeuroAdapter框架，直接以脑表征为条件控制潜在扩散模型，并提出IBBI双向可解释性框架分析扩散去噪步骤中的交叉注意力机制。

Result: 在公共fMRI数据集上展现出与先前工作相当的视觉重建质量，同时能揭示不同皮层区域如何影响生成轨迹。

Conclusion: 端到端脑到图像解码具有潜力，为通过视觉神经科学视角解释扩散模型建立了路径。

Abstract: Recent work has demonstrated that complex visual stimuli can be decoded from
human brain activity using deep generative models, helping brain science
researchers interpret how the brain represents real-world scenes. However, most
current approaches leverage mapping brain signals into intermediate image or
text feature spaces before guiding the generative process, masking the effect
of contributions from different brain areas on the final reconstruction output.
In this work, we propose NeuroAdapter, a visual decoding framework that
directly conditions a latent diffusion model on brain representations,
bypassing the need for intermediate feature spaces. Our method demonstrates
competitive visual reconstruction quality on public fMRI datasets compared to
prior work, while providing greater transparency into how brain signals shape
the generation process. To this end, we contribute an Image-Brain
BI-directional interpretability framework (IBBI) which investigates
cross-attention mechanisms across diffusion denoising steps to reveal how
different cortical areas influence the unfolding generative trajectory. Our
results highlight the potential of end-to-end brain-to-image decoding and
establish a path toward interpreting diffusion models through the lens of
visual neuroscience.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在挑战性光照条件下对新颖物体进行鲁棒6D姿态估计的问题，需要在准确初始姿态估计和高效实时跟踪之间取得平衡。

Method: 使用共享的光照不变颜色对特征表示，该特征既用于初始估计阶段的RGB-D视图与3D网格的配准，也用于跟踪阶段的时序对应关系验证，通过轻量级模型回归物体运动。

Result: 在基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法既有效又鲁棒，在保持高保真跟踪的同时提供有竞争力的姿态估计精度，即使面对突然的姿态变化。

Conclusion: 提出的集成方法通过共享特征表示实现了鲁棒的初始姿态估计和高效跟踪，在边缘设备上表现出色。

Abstract: Robust 6D pose estimation of novel objects under challenging illumination
remains a significant challenge, often requiring a trade-off between accurate
initial pose estimation and efficient real-time tracking. We present a unified
framework explicitly designed for efficient execution on edge devices, which
synergizes a robust initial estimation module with a fast motion-based tracker.
The key to our approach is a shared, lighting-invariant color-pair feature
representation that forms a consistent foundation for both stages. For initial
estimation, this feature facilitates robust registration between the live RGB-D
view and the object's 3D mesh. For tracking, the same feature logic validates
temporal correspondences, enabling a lightweight model to reliably regress the
object's motion. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that
our integrated approach is both effective and robust, providing competitive
pose estimation accuracy while maintaining high-fidelity tracking even through
abrupt pose changes.

TL;DR: 提出了RobuQ框架，通过Hadamard变换和混合精度激活量化，首次实现了DiT在平均2位激活量化下的稳定图像生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散变换器(DiTs)在图像生成中表现出色，但计算和内存成本高。量化感知训练(QAT)在DiTs中面临激活量化敏感性和分布复杂性的挑战。

Method: 建立三元权重基线，提出RobustQuantizer进行鲁棒激活量化，使用Hadamard变换将未知分布转换为正态分布，并提出首个仅激活混合精度网络(AMPN)管道。

Result: 在无条件/条件图像生成任务中，RobuQ在亚4位量化配置下达到最先进性能，首次在ImageNet-1K等大型数据集上实现平均2位激活量化的稳定竞争性图像生成。

Conclusion: RobuQ框架成功解决了DiT量化中的激活量化瓶颈，为极低比特量化提供了可行方案，推动了DiT的实际部署。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have recently emerged as a powerful backbone
for image generation, demonstrating superior scalability and performance over
U-Net architectures. However, their practical deployment is hindered by
substantial computational and memory costs. While Quantization-Aware Training
(QAT) has shown promise for U-Nets, its application to DiTs faces unique
challenges, primarily due to the sensitivity and distributional complexity of
activations. In this work, we identify activation quantization as the primary
bottleneck for pushing DiTs to extremely low-bit settings. To address this, we
propose a systematic QAT framework for DiTs, named RobuQ. We start by
establishing a strong ternary weight (W1.58A4) DiT baseline. Building upon
this, we propose RobustQuantizer to achieve robust activation quantization. Our
theoretical analyses show that the Hadamard transform can convert unknown
per-token distributions into per-token normal distributions, providing a strong
foundation for this method. Furthermore, we propose AMPN, the first
Activation-only Mixed-Precision Network pipeline for DiTs. This method applies
ternary weights across the entire network while allocating different activation
precisions to each layer to eliminate information bottlenecks. Through
extensive experiments on unconditional and conditional image generation, our
RobuQ framework achieves state-of-the-art performance for DiT quantization in
sub-4-bit quantization configuration. To the best of our knowledge, RobuQ is
the first achieving stable and competitive image generation on large datasets
like ImageNet-1K with activations quantized to average 2 bits. The code and
models will be available at https://github.com/racoonykc/RobuQ .

TL;DR: VividFace是一个高效的一步扩散框架，用于视频人脸增强，通过单步流匹配、联合潜在-像素训练策略和MLLM驱动的数据筛选，解决了现有方法在纹理建模、泛化能力和效率方面的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频人脸增强方法面临三个主要挑战：难以准确建模复杂面部纹理并保持时间一致性；由于高质量训练数据不足导致模型泛化能力受限；推理过程中重复去噪步骤导致效率低下。

Method: 基于预训练的WANX视频生成模型，采用单步流匹配范式利用强大的时空先验；提出联合潜在-像素人脸聚焦训练策略，在潜在空间和像素空间提供显式监督；引入MLLM驱动的数据筛选流程自动选择高质量视频人脸数据集。

Conclusion: VividFace通过创新的单步扩散框架和训练策略，有效解决了视频人脸增强中的关键挑战，为研究社区提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Video Face Enhancement (VFE) seeks to reconstruct high-quality facial regions
from degraded video sequences, a capability that underpins numerous
applications including video conferencing, film restoration, and surveillance.
Despite substantial progress in the field, current methods that primarily rely
on video super-resolution and generative frameworks continue to face three
fundamental challenges: (1) faithfully modeling intricate facial textures while
preserving temporal consistency; (2) restricted model generalization due to the
lack of high-quality face video training data; and (3) low efficiency caused by
repeated denoising steps during inference. To address these challenges, we
propose VividFace, a novel and efficient one-step diffusion framework for video
face enhancement. Built upon the pretrained WANX video generation model, our
method leverages powerful spatiotemporal priors through a single-step flow
matching paradigm, enabling direct mapping from degraded inputs to high-quality
outputs with significantly reduced inference time. To further boost efficiency,
we propose a Joint Latent-Pixel Face-Focused Training strategy that employs
stochastic switching between facial region optimization and global
reconstruction, providing explicit supervision in both latent and pixel spaces
through a progressive two-stage training process. Additionally, we introduce an
MLLM-driven data curation pipeline for automated selection of high-quality
video face datasets, enhancing model generalization. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that VividFace achieves state-of-the-art results in perceptual
quality, identity preservation, and temporal stability, while offering
practical resources for the research community.

TL;DR: GRS-SLAM3R是一个基于DUSt3R的端到端SLAM框架，支持序列化输入并增量估计全局坐标系下的度量尺度点云，通过空间记忆和子图划分实现全局一致性重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DUSt3R方法仅使用图像对估计点图，忽略了空间记忆和全局一致性，导致重建结果缺乏全局约束。

Method: 使用潜在状态作为空间记忆，设计基于transformer的门控更新模块来重置和更新空间记忆；将场景划分为子图，在子图内进行局部对齐，并使用相对约束将所有子图注册到共同的世界坐标系。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，该框架实现了优越的重建精度，同时保持实时性能。

Conclusion: GRS-SLAM3R通过空间记忆和子图策略有效解决了DUSt3R方法的全局一致性问题，实现了高精度的密集场景重建。

Abstract: DUSt3R-based end-to-end scene reconstruction has recently shown promising
results in dense visual SLAM. However, most existing methods only use image
pairs to estimate pointmaps, overlooking spatial memory and global
consistency.To this end, we introduce GRS-SLAM3R, an end-to-end SLAM framework
for dense scene reconstruction and pose estimation from RGB images without any
prior knowledge of the scene or camera parameters. Unlike existing DUSt3R-based
frameworks, which operate on all image pairs and predict per-pair point maps in
local coordinate frames, our method supports sequentialized input and
incrementally estimates metric-scale point clouds in the global coordinate. In
order to improve consistent spatial correlation, we use a latent state for
spatial memory and design a transformer-based gated update module to reset and
update the spatial memory that continuously aggregates and tracks relevant 3D
information across frames. Furthermore, we partition the scene into submaps,
apply local alignment within each submap, and register all submaps into a
common world frame using relative constraints, producing a globally consistent
map. Experiments on various datasets show that our framework achieves superior
reconstruction accuracy while maintaining real-time performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于模拟图像的SAR目标识别方法存在大量无关信息（如背景、噪声）影响迁移质量的问题，需要探索能迁移更纯净关键目标知识的新模拟数据。

Method: 提出多级异构知识迁移网络(MHKT)，包括：任务关联信息选择器(TAIS)分离非信息知识；目标通用知识迁移(TGKT)模块使用最大判别散度(MDD)进行分布对齐；类别关系知识迁移(CRKT)模块利用类别关系一致性约束。

Result: 在两个由FSCM数据和实测SAR图像组成的新数据集上的大量实验表明，该方法具有优越性能。

Conclusion: 基于FSCM的逐步知识选择和迁移确保了迁移知识的完整性，为SAR目标识别提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Simulated data-assisted SAR target recognition methods are the research
hotspot currently, devoted to solving the problem of limited samples. Existing
works revolve around simulated images, but the large amount of irrelevant
information embedded in the images, such as background, noise, etc., seriously
affects the quality of the migrated information. Our work explores a new
simulated data to migrate purer and key target knowledge, i.e., forward
scattering center model (FSCM) which models the actual local structure of the
target with strong physical meaning and interpretability. To achieve this
purpose, multi-level heterogeneous knowledge transfer (MHKT) network is
proposed, which fully migrates FSCM knowledge from the feature, distribution
and category levels, respectively. Specifically, we permit the more suitable
feature representations for the heterogeneous data and separate non-informative
knowledge by task-associated information selector (TAIS), to complete purer
target feature migration. In the distribution alignment, the new metric
function maximum discrimination divergence (MDD) in target generic knowledge
transfer (TGKT) module perceives transferable knowledge efficiently while
preserving discriminative structure about classes. Moreover, category relation
knowledge transfer (CRKT) module leverages the category relation consistency
constraint to break the dilemma of optimization bias towards simulation data
due to imbalance between simulated and measured data. Such stepwise knowledge
selection and migration will ensure the integrity of the migrated FSCM
knowledge. Notably, extensive experiments on two new datasets formed by FSCM
data and measured SAR images demonstrate the superior performance of our
method.

Conclusion: 该框架能够更准确地评估端到端自动驾驶模型在实际复杂交通环境中的性能，填补了现有基准测试与现实世界条件之间的差距。

Abstract: Closed-loop evaluation is increasingly critical for end-to-end autonomous
driving. Current closed-loop benchmarks using the CARLA simulator rely on
manually configured traffic scenarios, which can diverge from real-world
conditions, limiting their ability to reflect actual driving performance. To
address these limitations, we introduce a simple yet challenging closed-loop
evaluation framework that closely integrates real-world driving scenarios into
the CARLA simulator with infrastructure cooperation. Our approach involves
extracting 800 dynamic traffic scenarios selected from a comprehensive 100-hour
video dataset captured by high-mounted infrastructure sensors, and creating
static digital twin assets for 15 real-world intersections with consistent
visual appearance. These digital twins accurately replicate the traffic and
environmental characteristics of their real-world counterparts, enabling more
realistic simulations in CARLA. This evaluation is challenging due to the
diversity of driving behaviors, locations, weather conditions, and times of day
at complex urban intersections. In addition, we provide a comprehensive
closed-loop benchmark for evaluating end-to-end autonomous driving models.

Motivation: 传统Mamba架构依赖预定义的扫描路径，无法适应不同的图像退化情况，限制了恢复性能和计算效率。

Method: 提出VAMamba框架：1) QCLAM使用FIFO缓存存储历史表示，通过相似性指导智能特征融合；2) GPS-SS2D使用Vision Transformer生成得分图估计像素重要性，贪心策略确定最优扫描路径。

Abstract: Recent Mamba-based image restoration methods have achieved promising results
but remain
  limited by fixed scanning patterns and inefficient feature utilization.
Conventional Mamba
  architectures rely on predetermined paths that cannot adapt to diverse
degradations, constraining
  both restoration performance and computational efficiency. To overcome these
limitations, we
  propose VAMamba, a Visual Adaptive Mamba framework with two key innovations.
First,
  QCLAM(Queue-basedCacheLow-rankAdaptiveMemory)enhancesfeaturelearningthrougha
  FIFO cache that stores historical representations. Similarity between current
LoRA-adapted and

effectively controlling

A
  Vision Transformer generates score maps to estimate pixel importance, and a
greedy strategy de termines optimal forward and backward scanning paths. These
learned trajectories replace rigid
  patterns, enabling SS2D to perform targeted feature extraction. The
integration of QCLAM and
  GPS-SS2D allows VAMamba to adaptively focus on degraded regions while

Abstract: Scalable and realistic simulation of multi-agent traffic behavior is critical
for advancing autonomous driving technologies. Although existing data-driven
simulators have made significant strides in this domain, they predominantly
rely on supervised learning to align simulated distributions with real-world
driving scenarios. A persistent challenge, however, lies in the distributional
shift that arises between training and testing, which often undermines model
generalization in unseen environments. To address this limitation, we propose
SMART-R1, a novel R1-style reinforcement fine-tuning paradigm tailored for
next-token prediction models to better align agent behavior with human
preferences and evaluation metrics. Our approach introduces a metric-oriented
policy optimization algorithm to improve distribution alignment and an
iterative "SFT-RFT-SFT" training strategy that alternates between Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) to maximize performance
gains. Extensive experiments on the large-scale Waymo Open Motion Dataset

framework in enhancing foundation models. The results on the Waymo Open Sim

Abstract: Inspired by the human ability to learn and organize knowledge into
hierarchical taxonomies with prototypes, this paper addresses key limitations
in current deep hierarchical clustering methods. Existing methods often tie the
structure to the number of classes and underutilize the rich prototype
information available at intermediate hierarchical levels. We introduce deep
taxonomic networks, a novel deep latent variable approach designed to bridge
these gaps. Our method optimizes a large latent taxonomic hierarchy,
specifically a complete binary tree structured mixture-of-Gaussian prior within
a variational inference framework, to automatically discover taxonomic
structures and associated prototype clusters directly from unlabeled data
without assuming true label sizes. We analytically show that optimizing the
ELBO of our method encourages the discovery of hierarchical relationships among
prototypes. Empirically, our learned models demonstrate strong hierarchical
clustering performance, outperforming baselines across diverse image
classification datasets using our novel evaluation mechanism that leverages
prototype clusters discovered at all hierarchical levels. Qualitative results
further reveal that deep taxonomic networks discover rich and interpretable
hierarchical taxonomies, capturing both coarse-grained semantic categories and
fine-grained visual distinctions.

Abstract: This paper evaluates the current gaze estimation methods within an HRI
context of a shared workspace scenario. We introduce a new, annotated dataset
collected with the NICO robotic platform. We evaluate four state-of-the-art
gaze estimation models. The evaluation shows that the angular errors are close

terms of distance in the shared workspace the best median error is 16.48 cm
quantifying the practical limitations of current methods. We conclude by
discussing these limitations and offering recommendations on how to best
integrate gaze estimation as a modality in HRI systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出MAN模型，一种潜在扩散增强的多阶段抗噪网络，用于高效高质量的低剂量CT图像去噪，相比传统扩散模型推理速度提升60倍以上。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在低剂量CT去噪中表现优异，但计算成本极高，推理时间过长，阻碍了临床采用。需要开发既保持高质量又具有临床可行性的方法。

Method: 使用感知优化的自编码器在压缩潜在空间中操作，通过基于注意力的条件U-Net进行快速、确定性的条件去噪扩散过程，大幅降低计算开销。

Result: 在LDCT和Projection数据集上，模型实现了优越的感知质量，超越CNN/GAN方法，与计算量大的扩散模型如DDPM和Dn-Dp相媲美，推理速度快60倍以上，PSNR/SSIM指标保持竞争力。

Conclusion: 该工作通过弥合高保真度和临床可行性之间的差距，为医学成像中先进生成模型的实际应用展示了可行路径。

Abstract: While diffusion models have set a new benchmark for quality in Low-Dose
Computed Tomography (LDCT) denoising, their clinical adoption is critically
hindered by extreme computational costs, with inference times often exceeding
thousands of seconds per scan. To overcome this barrier, we introduce MAN, a
Latent Diffusion Enhanced Multistage Anti-Noise Network for Efficient and
High-Quality Low-Dose CT Image Denoising task. Our method operates in a
compressed latent space via a perceptually-optimized autoencoder, enabling an
attention-based conditional U-Net to perform the fast, deterministic
conditional denoising diffusion process with drastically reduced overhead. On
the LDCT and Projection dataset, our model achieves superior perceptual
quality, surpassing CNN/GAN-based methods while rivaling the reconstruction
fidelity of computationally heavy diffusion models like DDPM and Dn-Dp. Most
critically, in the inference stage, our model is over 60x faster than
representative pixel space diffusion denoisers, while remaining competitive on
PSNR/SSIM scores. By bridging the gap between high fidelity and clinical
viability, our work demonstrates a practical path forward for advanced
generative models in medical imaging.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Visual Mixing Diffusion (VMDiff)框架，通过噪声和潜在层面的融合解决多源图像融合中的共存生成和偏置生成问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决图像到图像生成中多源视觉线索融合的基本但未充分探索的问题，现有方法存在对象简单并列而非真正融合（共存生成）以及语义不平衡导致一个对象主导输出（偏置生成）的挑战。

Method: VMDiff框架包含：(1) 混合采样过程，结合引导去噪、反转和球面插值，实现结构感知融合；(2) 高效自适应调整模块，引入基于相似性的评分来自动搜索最优参数。

Result: 在包含780个概念对的基准测试中，该方法在视觉质量、语义一致性和人类评定的创造力方面优于强基线方法。

Conclusion: VMDiff通过噪声和潜在层面的融合有效解决了多源图像融合中的关键挑战，在艺术创作、虚拟现实和视觉媒体等领域具有广泛应用前景。

Abstract: Creating novel images by fusing visual cues from multiple sources is a
fundamental yet underexplored problem in image-to-image generation, with broad
applications in artistic creation, virtual reality and visual media. Existing
methods often face two key challenges: coexistent generation, where multiple
objects are simply juxtaposed without true integration, and bias generation,
where one object dominates the output due to semantic imbalance. To address
these issues, we propose Visual Mixing Diffusion (VMDiff), a simple yet
effective diffusion-based framework that synthesizes a single, coherent object
by integrating two input images at both noise and latent levels. Our approach
comprises: (1) a hybrid sampling process that combines guided denoising,
inversion, and spherical interpolation with adjustable parameters to achieve
structure-aware fusion, mitigating coexistent generation; and (2) an efficient
adaptive adjustment module, which introduces a novel similarity-based score to
automatically and adaptively search for optimal parameters, countering semantic
bias. Experiments on a curated benchmark of 780 concept pairs demonstrate that
our method outperforms strong baselines in visual quality, semantic
consistency, and human-rated creativity.

TL;DR: 提出了两种无需训练、在推理时利用显式动作参数的技术，用于基于扩散的机器人视频生成，显著提升了动作连贯性和视觉质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从显式动作轨迹生成逼真的机器人视频对于构建有效的世界模型和机器人基础模型至关重要，但现有方法通常将动作向量作为被动条件信号，未能充分利用其指导作用。

Method: 1. 动作缩放的无分类器引导：根据动作幅度动态调节引导强度，增强对运动强度的控制；2. 动作缩放的噪声截断：调整初始采样噪声分布以更好地匹配期望的运动动态。

Result: 在真实机器人操作数据集上的实验表明，这些技术显著提高了不同机器人环境中的动作连贯性和视觉质量。

Conclusion: 通过主动利用显式动作参数来指导扩散过程，可以有效提升机器人视频生成的质量和可控性，为构建更强大的机器人世界模型奠定了基础。

Abstract: Generating realistic robot videos from explicit action trajectories is a
critical step toward building effective world models and robotics foundation
models. We introduce two training-free, inference-time techniques that fully
exploit explicit action parameters in diffusion-based robot video generation.
Instead of treating action vectors as passive conditioning signals, our methods
actively incorporate them to guide both the classifier-free guidance process
and the initialization of Gaussian latents. First, action-scaled
classifier-free guidance dynamically modulates guidance strength in proportion
to action magnitude, enhancing controllability over motion intensity. Second,
action-scaled noise truncation adjusts the distribution of initially sampled
noise to better align with the desired motion dynamics. Experiments on real
robot manipulation datasets demonstrate that these techniques significantly
improve action coherence and visual quality across diverse robot environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FlowLUT是一个端到端的图像增强模型，结合了3D LUT的高效性、多先验知识和流匹配重建的参数无关特性，实现了计算效率和表示能力的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度学习图像增强方法在计算效率和表示能力之间的基本权衡问题，传统3D LUT虽然实时处理但表示灵活性不足且依赖固定先验。

Method: 使用可微分3D LUT集合进行色彩空间变换，轻量级内容感知网络预测融合权重，创新迭代流匹配方法恢复局部结构细节，整体模型在复合损失函数下联合优化。

Result: 在三个基准测试上进行了广泛实验，证明了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: FlowLUT成功解决了图像增强中计算效率与表示能力之间的权衡问题，实现了场景自适应的色彩校正和细节恢复。

Abstract: Deep learning-based image enhancement methods face a fundamental trade-off
between computational efficiency and representational capacity. For example,
although a conventional three-dimensional Look-Up Table (3D LUT) can process a
degraded image in real time, it lacks representational flexibility and depends
solely on a fixed prior. To address this problem, we introduce FlowLUT, a novel
end-to-end model that integrates the efficiency of LUTs, multiple priors, and
the parameter-independent characteristic of flow-matched reconstructed images.
Specifically, firstly, the input image is transformed in color space by a
collection of differentiable 3D LUTs (containing a large number of 3D LUTs with
different priors). Subsequently, a lightweight content-aware dynamically
predicts fusion weights, enabling scene-adaptive color correction with
$\mathcal{O}(1)$ complexity. Next, a lightweight fusion prediction network runs
on multiple 3D LUTs, with $\mathcal{O}(1)$ complexity for scene-adaptive color
correction.Furthermore, to address the inherent representation limitations of
LUTs, we design an innovative iterative flow matching method to restore local
structural details and eliminate artifacts. Finally, the entire model is
jointly optimized under a composite loss function enforcing perceptual and
structural fidelity. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method on three benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SCOPE是一种基于扩散模型的类别级物体姿态估计方法，利用DINOv2特征作为连续语义先验，无需离散类别标签，在合成训练和真实世界应用中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决机器人在开放环境中遇到未知物体时的姿态估计问题，需要语义理解来泛化到已知类别及以外的物体。

Method: 结合DINOv2特征与逼真训练数据，通过交叉注意力注入连续语义先验，使用点法线噪声模型减小Sim2Real差距。

Result: 在合成训练的类别级物体姿态估计中，SCOPE在5°5cm度量上相对现有技术提升31.9%，在未知类别物体抓取任务中成功率高达100%。

Conclusion: SCOPE通过连续语义先验实现了跨物体实例的规范化坐标系统学习，能够泛化到已知类别之外的物体，为开放环境中的物体操作提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Object manipulation requires accurate object pose estimation. In open
environments, robots encounter unknown objects, which requires semantic
understanding in order to generalize both to known categories and beyond. To
resolve this challenge, we present SCOPE, a diffusion-based category-level
object pose estimation model that eliminates the need for discrete category
labels by leveraging DINOv2 features as continuous semantic priors. By
combining these DINOv2 features with photorealistic training data and a noise
model for point normals, we reduce the Sim2Real gap in category-level object
pose estimation. Furthermore, injecting the continuous semantic priors via
cross-attention enables SCOPE to learn canonicalized object coordinate systems
across object instances beyond the distribution of known categories. SCOPE
outperforms the current state of the art in synthetically trained
category-level object pose estimation, achieving a relative improvement of
31.9\% on the 5$^\circ$5cm metric. Additional experiments on two instance-level
datasets demonstrate generalization beyond known object categories, enabling
grasping of unseen objects from unknown categories with a success rate of up to
100\%. Code available: https://github.com/hoenigpeter/scope.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的人-场景交互数据集存在交互类别不足、通常只考虑与静态物体的交互等问题，而收集包含可移动物体的数据集既困难又昂贵。

Method: 首先使用3D视觉定位模型识别交互对象，然后提出手-物联合可操作性学习来预测不同手关节和物体部位的接触区域，最后通过局部场景建模和碰撞避免约束优化交互。

Result: 综合实验表明，该方法在生成物理上合理、符合文本要求的交互方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该研究成功解决了3D场景中可移动物体的人-物交互生成挑战，通过提出的数据集和流水线方法实现了更真实和多样化的交互生成。

Abstract: We propose a novel task of text-controlled human object interaction
generation in 3D scenes with movable objects. Existing human-scene interaction
datasets suffer from insufficient interaction categories and typically only
consider interactions with static objects (do not change object positions), and
the collection of such datasets with movable objects is difficult and costly.
To address this problem, we construct the InteractMove dataset for Movable
Human-Object Interaction in 3D Scenes by aligning existing human object
interaction data with scene contexts, featuring three key characteristics: 1)
scenes containing multiple movable objects with text-controlled interaction
specifications (including same-category distractors requiring spatial and 3D
scene context understanding), 2) diverse object types and sizes with varied
interaction patterns (one-hand, two-hand, etc.), and 3) physically plausible
object manipulation trajectories. With the introduction of various movable
objects, this task becomes more challenging, as the model needs to identify
objects to be interacted with accurately, learn to interact with objects of
different sizes and categories, and avoid collisions between movable objects
and the scene. To tackle such challenges, we propose a novel pipeline solution.
We first use 3D visual grounding models to identify the interaction object.
Then, we propose a hand-object joint affordance learning to predict contact
regions for different hand joints and object parts, enabling accurate grasping
and manipulation of diverse objects. Finally, we optimize interactions with
local-scene modeling and collision avoidance constraints, ensuring physically
plausible motions and avoiding collisions between objects and the scene.
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate our method's superiority in generating
physically plausible, text-compliant interactions compared to existing
approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视网膜血管分割方法依赖监督学习和大量人工标注，这在光学相干断层扫描血管成像中成本高、易出错且难以获取。需要开发无需标注的无监督方法。

Abstract: Structural changes in retinal blood vessels are critical biomarkers for the
onset and progression of glaucoma and other ocular diseases. However, current
vessel segmentation approaches largely rely on supervised learning and
extensive manual annotations, which are costly, error-prone, and difficult to
obtain in optical coherence tomography angiography. Here we present
BioVessel-Net, an unsupervised generative framework that integrates vessel
biostatistics with adversarial refinement and a radius-guided segmentation
strategy. Unlike pixel-based methods, BioVessel-Net directly models vascular
structures with biostatistical coherence, achieving accurate and explainable
vessel extraction without labeled data or high-performance computing. To
support training and evaluation, we introduce RetinaMix, a new benchmark
dataset of 2D and 3D OCTA images with high-resolution vessel details from
diverse populations. Experimental results demonstrate that BioVessel-Net
achieves near-perfect segmentation accuracy across RetinaMix and existing
datasets, substantially outperforming state-of-the-art supervised and
semi-supervised methods. Together, BioVessel-Net and RetinaMix provide a
label-free, computationally efficient, and clinically interpretable solution
for retinal vessel analysis, with broad potential for glaucoma monitoring,
blood flow modeling, and progression prediction. Code and dataset are

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水面漂浮碎片的准确分割常受到水面反光和户外光照变化的影响，偏振成像提供了一种单传感器方法来减轻这些干扰。

Method: 在PoTATO公共数据集上对最先进的融合网络进行基准测试，并与使用传统模型的单图像基线进行比较。

Result: 偏振线索有助于恢复低对比度物体并抑制反射引起的误报，提高了平均IoU并降低了轮廓误差，但增加了模型大小和计算负载。

Conclusion: 通过提供可复现的诊断基准和公开代码，帮助研究人员判断偏振相机是否适合其应用，并加速相关研究。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of floating debris on water is often compromised by
surface glare and changing outdoor illumination. Polarimetric imaging offers a
single-sensor route to mitigate water-surface glare that disrupts semantic
segmentation of floating objects. We benchmark state-of-the-art fusion networks
on PoTATO, a public dataset of polarimetric images of plastic bottles in inland
waterways, and compare their performance with single-image baselines using
traditional models. Our results indicate that polarimetric cues help recover
low-contrast objects and suppress reflection-induced false positives, raising
mean IoU and lowering contour error relative to RGB inputs. These sharper masks
come at a cost: the additional channels enlarge the models increasing the
computational load and introducing the risk of new false positives. By
providing a reproducible, diagnostic benchmark and publicly available code, we
hope to help researchers choose if polarized cameras are suitable for their
applications and to accelerate related research.

Result: 实验结果表明DiffInk在字形准确性和风格保真度方面优于现有最先进方法，同时显著提高了生成效率。

Conclusion: DiffInk通过潜在空间的语义结构化和扩散Transformer的有效集成，实现了高质量的全行手写生成，为文本到手写转换提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Deep generative models have advanced text-to-online handwriting generation
(TOHG), which aims to synthesize realistic pen trajectories conditioned on
textual input and style references. However, most existing methods still
primarily focus on character- or word-level generation, resulting in
inefficiency and a lack of holistic structural modeling when applied to full
text lines. To address these issues, we propose DiffInk, the first latent
diffusion Transformer framework for full-line handwriting generation. We first
introduce InkVAE, a novel sequential variational autoencoder enhanced with two
complementary latent-space regularization losses: (1) an OCR-based loss
enforcing glyph-level accuracy, and (2) a style-classification loss preserving
writing style. This dual regularization yields a semantically structured latent
space where character content and writer styles are effectively disentangled.
We then introduce InkDiT, a novel latent diffusion Transformer that integrates
target text and reference styles to generate coherent pen trajectories.
Experimental results demonstrate that DiffInk outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods in both glyph accuracy and style fidelity, while
significantly improving generation efficiency. Code will be made publicly
available.

Motivation: 同步校准的RGB-热成像图像对稀缺，限制了多模态图像对齐和检索等应用的发展，RGB-T图像转换成为解决这一挑战的有前景方案。

Method: 采用自适应流基生成模型，结合RGB图像条件架构和风格解耦机制，收集了8个公开RGB-T配对数据集，并引入了3个新的大规模卫星-航空RGB-T数据集。

Result: 在多个RGB-T基准测试中，ThermalGen实现了与现有GAN基和扩散基方法相当或更优的转换性能，能够合成反映视角、传感器特性和环境条件显著变化的热成像图像。

Conclusion: ThermalGen是首个能够合成反映视角、传感器特性和环境条件显著变化的热成像图像的RGB-T图像转换模型，为多模态视觉任务提供了有力工具。

Abstract: Paired RGB-thermal data is crucial for visual-thermal sensor fusion and
cross-modality tasks, including important applications such as multi-modal
image alignment and retrieval. However, the scarcity of synchronized and
calibrated RGB-thermal image pairs presents a major obstacle to progress in
these areas. To overcome this challenge, RGB-to-Thermal (RGB-T) image
translation has emerged as a promising solution, enabling the synthesis of
thermal images from abundant RGB datasets for training purposes. In this study,
we propose ThermalGen, an adaptive flow-based generative model for RGB-T image
translation, incorporating an RGB image conditioning architecture and a
style-disentangled mechanism. To support large-scale training, we curated eight
public satellite-aerial, aerial, and ground RGB-T paired datasets, and
introduced three new large-scale satellite-aerial RGB-T datasets--DJI-day,
Bosonplus-day, and Bosonplus-night--captured across diverse times, sensor
types, and geographic regions. Extensive evaluations across multiple RGB-T
benchmarks demonstrate that ThermalGen achieves comparable or superior
translation performance compared to existing GAN-based and diffusion-based
methods. To our knowledge, ThermalGen is the first RGB-T image translation
model capable of synthesizing thermal images that reflect significant
variations in viewpoints, sensor characteristics, and environmental conditions.

TL;DR: 提出RIV模型，通过自省训练和递归推理机制赋予掩码扩散视觉语言模型自我纠错能力，在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的掩码扩散视觉语言模型缺乏自我纠错能力，无法修正生成token中的错误。

Method: 1. 自省训练：引入自省模型识别生成序列中的错误（语法、拼写和逻辑错误）；2. 递归推理：通过交替的"解掩码→自省→重掩码"过程递归改进输出。

Result: 在多个基准测试中实现了最先进的性能，超越了大多数现有的MDVLM模型。

Conclusion: RIV模型成功为掩码扩散视觉语言模型添加了自我纠错能力，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Mask Diffusion-based Vision Language Models (MDVLMs) have achieved remarkable
progress in multimodal understanding tasks. However, these models are unable to
correct errors in generated tokens, meaning they lack self-correction
capability. In this paper, we propose Recursive Introspection Mask Diffusion
Vision Language Model (RIV), which equips the model with self-correction
ability through two novel mechanisms. The first is Introspection Training,
where an Introspection Model is introduced to identify errors within generated
sequences. Introspection Training enables the model to detect not only
grammatical and spelling mistakes, but more importantly, logical errors. The
second is Recursive Inference. Beginning with the standard unmasking step, the
learned Introspection Model helps to identify errors in the output sequence and
remask them. This alternating
($\text{unmask}\rightarrow\text{introspection}\rightarrow\text{remask}$)
process is repeated recursively until reliable results are obtained.
Experimental results on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed RIV
achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming most existing MDVLMs.

Abstract: This paper develops a mathematical argument and algorithms for building
representations of data from event-based cameras, that we call Fast Feature
Field ($\text{F}^3$). We learn this representation by predicting future events
from past events and show that it preserves scene structure and motion
information. $\text{F}^3$ exploits the sparsity of event data and is robust to
noise and variations in event rates. It can be computed efficiently using ideas
from multi-resolution hash encoding and deep sets - achieving 120 Hz at HD and
440 Hz at VGA resolutions. $\text{F}^3$ represents events within a contiguous
spatiotemporal volume as a multi-channel image, enabling a range of downstream
tasks. We obtain state-of-the-art performance on optical flow estimation,
semantic segmentation, and monocular metric depth estimation, on data from
three robotic platforms (a car, a quadruped robot and a flying platform),
across different lighting conditions (daytime, nighttime), environments
(indoors, outdoors, urban, as well as off-road) and dynamic vision sensors
(resolutions and event rates). Our implementations can predict these tasks at
25-75 Hz at HD resolution.

Abstract: Multi-task dense prediction, which aims to jointly solve tasks like semantic
segmentation and depth estimation, is crucial for robotics applications but
suffers from domain shift when deploying models in new environments. While
unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) addresses this challenge for single tasks,
existing multi-task UDA methods primarily rely on adversarial learning
approaches that are less effective than recent self-training techniques. In
this paper, we introduce FAMDA, a simple yet effective UDA framework that
bridges this gap by leveraging Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) as powerful
teachers. Our approach integrates Segmentation and Depth foundation models into
a self-training paradigm to generate high-quality pseudo-labels for the target
domain, effectively distilling their robust generalization capabilities into a
single, efficient student network. Extensive experiments show that FAMDA
achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on standard synthetic-to-real UDA
multi-task learning (MTL) benchmarks and a challenging new day-to-night
adaptation task. Our framework enables the training of highly efficient models;
a lightweight variant achieves SOTA accuracy while being more than 10$\times$
smaller than foundation models, highlighting FAMDA's suitability for creating
domain-adaptive and efficient models for resource-constrained robotics
applications.

Abstract: This paper proposes MotionVerse, a unified framework that harnesses the
capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to comprehend, generate, and edit
human motion in both single-person and multi-person scenarios. To efficiently
represent motion data, we employ a motion tokenizer with residual quantization,
which converts continuous motion sequences into multi-stream discrete tokens.
Furthermore, we introduce a \textit{Delay Parallel} Modeling strategy, which
temporally staggers the encoding of residual token streams. This design enables
LLMs to effectively capture inter-stream dependencies while maintaining
computational efficiency comparable to single-stream modeling. Moreover, to
alleviate modality interference between motion and language, we design a
\textit{dual-tower architecture} with modality-specific parameters, ensuring
stable integration of motion information for both comprehension and generation
tasks. Comprehensive ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of each
component in MotionVerse, and extensive experiments showcase its superior
performance across a wide range of motion-relevant tasks.

TL;DR: LightFair是一种轻量级方法，通过微调文本嵌入来解决文本到图像扩散模型中的偏见问题，采用协作距离约束去偏策略和两阶段文本引导采样策略，在保持生成质量的同时显著减少训练和采样负担。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么需要全参数训练，要么依赖辅助网络进行校正，导致训练或采样负担重且性能不理想。本文聚焦于通过微调文本嵌入来减轻偏见，因为文本编码器是最可微调的前端模块。

Method: 提出协作距离约束去偏策略来平衡嵌入距离以改善公平性，无需辅助参考；引入两阶段文本引导采样策略来限制去偏文本编码器的干预时机，以保持原始生成质量。

Result: 在Stable Diffusion v1.5上，该方法仅需1/4的训练负担就实现了最先进的去偏效果，采样负担几乎没有增加。

Conclusion: LightFair是一种有效且高效的轻量级方法，能够在保持生成质量的同时显著减少文本到图像扩散模型的偏见问题。

Abstract: This paper explores a novel lightweight approach LightFair to achieve fair
text-to-image diffusion models (T2I DMs) by addressing the adverse effects of
the text encoder. Most existing methods either couple different parts of the
diffusion model for full-parameter training or rely on auxiliary networks for
correction. They incur heavy training or sampling burden and unsatisfactory
performance. Since T2I DMs consist of multiple components, with the text
encoder being the most fine-tunable and front-end module, this paper focuses on
mitigating bias by fine-tuning text embeddings. To validate feasibility, we
observe that the text encoder's neutral embedding output shows substantial
skewness across image embeddings of various attributes in the CLIP space. More
importantly, the noise prediction network further amplifies this imbalance. To
finetune the text embedding, we propose a collaborative distance-constrained
debiasing strategy that balances embedding distances to improve fairness
without auxiliary references. However, mitigating bias can compromise the
original generation quality. To address this, we introduce a two-stage
text-guided sampling strategy to limit when the debiased text encoder
intervenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LightFair is effective and
efficient. Notably, on Stable Diffusion v1.5, our method achieves SOTA
debiasing at just $1/4$ of the training burden, with virtually no increase in
sampling burden. The code is available at https://github.com/boyuh/LightFair.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EfficientMIL是一种用于全切片图像分类的线性复杂度多实例学习方法，通过自适应补丁选择器和高效序列模型替代Transformer的自注意力机制，显著提升计算效率并在多个病理数据集上超越现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于注意力机制的SOTA MIL方法在处理数十万个补丁时存在二次复杂度问题，需要大量计算资源，存在计算瓶颈。

Method: 提出EfficientMIL框架，包含自适应补丁选择器(APS)，用GRU、LSTM和Mamba等线性复杂度序列模型替代Transformer的二次复杂度自注意力机制。

Result: 在TCGA-Lung数据集上，EfficientMIL-Mamba达到AUC 0.976和准确率0.933；在CAMELYON16数据集上，EfficientMIL-GRU达到AUC 0.990和准确率0.975，均超越之前SOTA方法。APS在补丁选择上也比传统策略更有效。

Conclusion: EfficientMIL在显著提升计算效率的同时，在多个病理数据集上实现了优于现有方法的性能，证明了线性复杂度序列模型在WSI分类中的有效性。

Abstract: Whole slide images (WSIs) classification represents a fundamental challenge
in computational pathology, where multiple instance learning (MIL) has emerged
as the dominant paradigm. Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) MIL methods rely on
attention mechanisms, achieving good performance but requiring substantial
computational resources due to quadratic complexity when processing hundreds of
thousands of patches. To address this computational bottleneck, we introduce
EfficientMIL, a novel linear-complexity MIL approach for WSIs classification
with the patches selection module Adaptive Patch Selector (APS) that we
designed, replacing the quadratic-complexity self-attention mechanisms in
Transformer-based MIL methods with efficient sequence models including
RNN-based GRU, LSTM, and State Space Model (SSM) Mamba. EfficientMIL achieves
significant computational efficiency improvements while outperforming other MIL
methods across multiple histopathology datasets. On TCGA-Lung dataset,
EfficientMIL-Mamba achieved AUC of 0.976 and accuracy of 0.933, while on
CAMELYON16 dataset, EfficientMIL-GRU achieved AUC of 0.990 and accuracy of
0.975, surpassing previous state-of-the-art methods. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that APS is also more effective for patches selection than
conventional selection strategies.

TL;DR: 提出一种无需训练的多图像布局控制方法，通过图像而非文本来指定内容，并指导模型放置每个元素的位置


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本到图像模型虽然能生成逼真图像，但文本控制存在局限性，需要更精确的指导来定义内容和位置

Method: 训练免费的方法，每个参考只需单张图像，提供对象和部分级别的显式简单控制

Result: 在各种图像合成任务中证明了方法的有效性

Conclusion: 该方法能够实现多图像布局的精确控制，为图像合成提供了更细粒度的控制能力

Abstract: Text-to-image models have achieved a level of realism that enables the
generation of highly convincing images. However, text-based control can be a
limiting factor when more explicit guidance is needed. Defining both the
content and its precise placement within an image is crucial for achieving
finer control. In this work, we address the challenge of multi-image layout
control, where the desired content is specified through images rather than
text, and the model is guided on where to place each element. Our approach is
training-free, requires a single image per reference, and provides explicit and
simple control for object and part-level composition. We demonstrate its
effectiveness across various image composition tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Sparse-Up框架，通过稀疏体素引导纹理重建，使用表面锚定和视域分区技术突破分辨率限制，在保持几何一致性的同时保留纹理高频细节。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D资产创建方法存在高频细节丢失问题，要么牺牲跨视图一致性导致纹理撕裂，要么受限于显式体素分辨率而无法保留精细纹理细节。

Method: 采用稀疏体素指导纹理重建，表面锚定通过可学习上采样策略将体素约束在网格表面，视域分区使用图像块引导的体素分区方案，仅对可见局部块进行梯度监督和反向传播。

Result: 表面锚定消除了传统体素上采样中70%以上的冗余体素，视域分区显著减少了高分辨率体素训练时的内存消耗。

Conclusion: Sparse-Up是一个内存高效的高保真纹理建模框架，能够在保持几何一致性的同时有效保留纹理高频细节。

Abstract: The creation of high-fidelity 3D assets is often hindered by a 'pixel-level
pain point': the loss of high-frequency details. Existing methods often trade
off one aspect for another: either sacrificing cross-view consistency,
resulting in torn or drifting textures, or remaining trapped by the resolution
ceiling of explicit voxels, forfeiting fine texture detail. In this work, we
propose Sparse-Up, a memory-efficient, high-fidelity texture modeling framework
that effectively preserves high-frequency details. We use sparse voxels to
guide texture reconstruction and ensure multi-view consistency, while
leveraging surface anchoring and view-domain partitioning to break through
resolution constraints. Surface anchoring employs a learnable upsampling
strategy to constrain voxels to the mesh surface, eliminating over 70% of
redundant voxels present in traditional voxel upsampling. View-domain
partitioning introduces an image patch-guided voxel partitioning scheme,
supervising and back-propagating gradients only on visible local patches.
Through these two strategies, we can significantly reduce memory consumption
during high-resolution voxel training without sacrificing geometric
consistency, while preserving high-frequency details in textures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集缺乏具有挑战性的多跳问题和高质量的视频基础推理数据，限制了RLVR在复杂视频推理中的应用。

Method: 开发了多阶段合成流程生成ReWatch数据集，包括ReWatch-Caption、ReWatch-QA和ReWatch-CoT；提出了多智能体ReAct框架用于CoT合成；构建了ReWatch-R1模型，使用SFT和RLVR框架，并引入了O&R奖励机制。

Conclusion: ReWatch数据集和ReWatch-R1模型有效解决了视频推理中的数据瓶颈问题，通过创新的数据合成方法和奖励机制显著提升了视频推理能力。

Abstract: While Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) significantly
advances image reasoning in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), its
application to complex video reasoning remains underdeveloped. This gap stems
primarily from a critical data bottleneck: existing datasets lack the
challenging, multi-hop questions and high-quality, video-grounded
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data necessary to effectively bootstrap RLVR. To address
this, we introduce ReWatch, a large-scale dataset built to foster advanced
video reasoning. We propose a novel multi-stage synthesis pipeline to
synthesize its three components: ReWatch-Caption, ReWatch-QA, and ReWatch-CoT.
A core innovation is our Multi-Agent ReAct framework for CoT synthesis, which
simulates a human-like "re-watching" process to generate video-grounded
reasoning traces by explicitly modeling information retrieval and verification.
Building on this dataset, we develop ReWatch-R1 by post-training a strong
baseline LVLM with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and our RLVR framework. This
framework incorporates a novel Observation \& Reasoning (O\&R) reward mechanism
that evaluates both the final answer's correctness and the reasoning's
alignment with video content, directly penalizing hallucination. Our
experiments show that ReWatch-R1 achieves state-of-the-art average performance
on five challenging video reasoning benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HIVTP是一种无需训练的方法，通过分层视觉令牌剪枝来提高视觉语言模型的推理效率，使用中间层注意力图来评估令牌重要性，在保持准确性的同时显著降低推理时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉编码器输出的视觉令牌数量庞大严重阻碍推理效率，许多令牌并不重要可以被安全剪枝，但现有方法在效率和准确性之间存在权衡。

Method: 提出基于中间层注意力图的分层视觉令牌剪枝方法：将1D令牌序列重塑为2D空间布局，在全局保留阶段按区域保留高重要性令牌，在局部保留阶段按小窗口保留最重要令牌。

Result: HIVTP将LLaVA-v1.5-7B和LLaVA-Next-7B的首令牌时间分别降低50.0%和55.1%，令牌生成吞吐量分别提升60.9%和47.3%，在某些基准测试上甚至提高了准确性。

Conclusion: HIVTP在保持甚至提高准确性的同时，显著提升了视觉语言模型的推理效率，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown strong capabilities on diverse
multimodal tasks. However, the large number of visual tokens output by the
vision encoder severely hinders inference efficiency, and prior studies have
shown that many of these tokens are not important and can therefore be safely
pruned. In this work, we propose HIVTP, a training-free method to improve VLMs
efficiency via hierarchical visual token pruning using a novel
middle-layer-based importance score. Specifically, we utilize attention maps
extracted from the middle layers of the vision encoder, which better reflect
fine-grained and object-level attention, to estimate visual token importance.
Based on this, we propose a hierarchical visual token pruning method to retain
both globally and locally important visual tokens. Specifically, we reshape the
1-D visual token sequence output by the vision encoder into a 2-D spatial
layout. In the global retaining stage, we divide the image into regions and
retain tokens with higher importance scores in each region; in the local
retaining stage, we then divide the image into small windows and retain the
most important token in each local window. Experimental results show that our
proposed method, HIVTP, can reduce the time-to-first-token (TTFT) of
LLaVA-v1.5-7B and LLaVA-Next-7B by up to 50.0% and 55.1%, respectively, and
improve the token generation throughput by up to 60.9% and 47.3%, without
sacrificing accuracy, and even achieving improvements on certain benchmarks.
Compared with prior works, HIVTP achieves better accuracy while offering higher
inference efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Vision Transformer模型在处理手术视频时计算成本过高，且现有令牌合并方法未能充分考虑视频数据的时空结构和信息分布异质性

Method: 采用解耦策略分别处理时空维度：时间组件通过显著性加权合并连续帧的空间对应令牌；空间组件通过时间稳定性分析优先合并静态令牌，保护动态区域

Result: 在训练无关的方式下实现超过65%的GFLOPs减少，同时在综合手术视频任务中保持竞争性准确率

Conclusion: STIM-TM是首个专门针对手术视频理解的令牌合并方法，有效解决了手术应用中的计算瓶颈问题

Abstract: Vision Transformer models have shown impressive effectiveness in the surgical
video understanding tasks through long-range dependency modeling. However,
current methods suffer from prohibitive computational costs due to processing
massive spatiotemporal tokens across video frames. While prior work on token
merging has advanced model efficiency, they fail to adequately consider the
inherent spatiotemporal structure of video data and overlook the heterogeneous
nature of information distribution, leading to suboptimal performance. In this
paper, we propose a spatiotemporal information mining token merging (STIM-TM)
method, representing the first dedicated approach for surgical video
understanding. STIM-TM introduces a decoupled strategy that reduces token
redundancy along temporal and spatial dimensions independently. Specifically,
the temporal component merges spatially corresponding tokens from consecutive
frames using saliency weighting, preserving critical sequential information and
maintaining continuity. Meanwhile, the spatial component prioritizes merging
static tokens through temporal stability analysis, protecting dynamic regions
containing essential surgical information. Operating in a training-free manner,
STIM-TM achieves significant efficiency gains with over $65\%$ GFLOPs reduction
while preserving competitive accuracy across comprehensive surgical video
tasks. Our method also supports efficient training of long-sequence surgical
videos, addressing computational bottlenecks in surgical applications.

Motivation: 现有多模态大语言模型评估方法无法明确区分全局推理与局部视觉线索的依赖，阻碍了有效数据集构建和面向现实世界的模型开发。

Method: 通过系统比较参考模型在图像块与完整图像上的性能表现，开发了RCI评分来直接量化数据集对全局与局部视觉信息的依赖。

Result: 对13个广泛使用的多模态基准应用RCI后发现，大多数基准偏向局部推理并表现出显著的空间偏差，存在现实应用风险。

Conclusion: RCI为研究人员提供了诊断和缓解这些偏差的可操作工具，能够构建更好的数据集和基准来促进稳健、企业级多模态系统的发展。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved impressive results on
vision-language benchmarks, yet it remains unclear whether these benchmarks
assess genuine global reasoning or allow success via localized visual cues.
Existing evaluation methods do not explicitly measure this distinction,
hindering effective dataset curation and real-world focused model development.
  We introduce Region Comprehension Index (RCI), the first model-based score to
directly quantify a dataset's reliance on global versus local visual
information. RCI systematically compares reference-model performance on image
patches versus full images, revealing if tasks require holistic image
understanding or can be solved with partial or localized visual cues.
  When applying RCI to 13 widely used multimodal benchmarks, we observed that
most of them favor localized reasoning and exhibit significant spatial biases,
indicating potential risks in real-world applications. RCI equips researchers &
practitioners with an actionable tool for diagnosing & mitigating these biases,
enabling the construction of datasets and benchmarks to foster the development
of robust, enterprise-ready multimodal systems.

Motivation: 现有CNN-Transformer混合模型依赖高复杂度全局注意力机制捕获长距离依赖，导致非线性计算复杂度和显著资源消耗，需要在模型性能和计算效率之间取得平衡。

Method: 集成双向空间感知分支捕获脑区长距离空间上下文依赖，结合多尺度自蒸馏融合策略增强分层特征表示和语义信息传递。

Conclusion: 该框架有效缓解了体积分割中二次计算复杂度的瓶颈，同时解决了全局感知不足的限制，实现了性能与效率的良好平衡。

Abstract: Numerous CNN-Transformer hybrid models rely on high-complexity global
attention mechanisms to capture long-range dependencies, which introduces
non-linear computational complexity and leads to significant resource
consumption. Although knowledge distillation and sparse attention mechanisms
can improve efficiency, they often fall short of delivering the high
segmentation accuracy necessary for complex tasks. Balancing model performance
with computational efficiency remains a critical challenge. In this work, we
propose a novel 3D multi-modal image segmentation framework, termed MSD-KMamba,
which integrates bidirectional spatial perception with multi-scale
self-distillation. The bidirectional spatial aware branch effectively captures
long-range spatial context dependencies across brain regions, while also
incorporating a powerful nonlinear feature extraction mechanism that further
enhances the model's ability to learn complex and heterogeneous patterns. In
addition, the proposed multi-scale self-distilled fusion strategy strengthens
hierarchical feature representations and improves the transfer of semantic
information at different resolution levels. By jointly leveraging the
bidirectional spatial perception branch and the multi-scale self-distilled
fusion strategy, our framework effectively mitigates the bottleneck of
quadratic computational complexity in volumetric segmentation, while
simultaneously addressing the limitation of insufficient global perception.
Extensive experiments on multiple standard benchmark datasets demonstrate that
MSD-KMamba consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in segmentation
accuracy, robustness, and generalization, while maintaining high computational
efficiency and favorable scalability. The source code of MSD-KMamba is publicly
available at https://github.com/daimao-zhang/MSD-KMamba.

Motivation: 扩散变换器在视频生成方面表现出色，但计算和内存成本过高阻碍实际部署。单独使用量化或稀疏化在激进压缩下会导致严重性能下降，需要统一框架来解决这些问题。

Method: 1. 多尺度显著注意力蒸馏：利用全局结构指导和局部显著监督缓解量化偏差

Result: 在HunyuanVideo-13B上，QuantSparse达到20.88 PSNR，显著优于最先进的量化基线Q-VDiT（16.85 PSNR），同时实现3.68倍存储减少和1.88倍端到端推理加速。

Conclusion: QuantSparse框架成功统一了模型量化和注意力稀疏化，在保持高质量视频生成的同时大幅提升了效率，为实际部署提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion transformers exhibit remarkable video generation capability, yet
their prohibitive computational and memory costs hinder practical deployment.
Model quantization and attention sparsification are two promising directions
for compression, but each alone suffers severe performance degradation under
aggressive compression. Combining them promises compounded efficiency gains,
but naive integration is ineffective. The sparsity-induced information loss
exacerbates quantization noise, leading to amplified attention shifts. To
address this, we propose \textbf{QuantSparse}, a unified framework that
integrates model quantization with attention sparsification. Specifically, we
introduce \textit{Multi-Scale Salient Attention Distillation}, which leverages
both global structural guidance and local salient supervision to mitigate
quantization-induced bias. In addition, we develop \textit{Second-Order Sparse
Attention Reparameterization}, which exploits the temporal stability of
second-order residuals to efficiently recover information lost under sparsity.
Experiments on HunyuanVideo-13B demonstrate that QuantSparse achieves 20.88
PSNR, substantially outperforming the state-of-the-art quantization baseline
Q-VDiT (16.85 PSNR), while simultaneously delivering a \textbf{3.68$\times$}

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试存在两个关键限制：1）使用文本描述而非视觉信息，无法准确评估基于视觉语言模型的具身智能体；2）使用单一静态视角，限制了智能体的自由探索能力。

Method: 提供动态第一人称视角图像，允许具身智能体在模拟家庭环境中自由探索，获得多个动态视角进行更全面的检查。

Result: 对主流视觉语言模型的综合评估显示，即使表现最好的模型F1分数也仅为10.23%，表明当前模型在识别安全隐患和选择有效探索策略方面存在显著局限性。

Conclusion: HomeSafeBench将为未来家庭安全检查相关研究提供有价值的参考和支持，数据集和代码将公开发布。

Abstract: Embodied agents can identify and report safety hazards in the home
environments. Accurately evaluating their capabilities in home safety
inspection tasks is curcial, but existing benchmarks suffer from two key
limitations. First, they oversimplify safety inspection tasks by using textual
descriptions of the environment instead of direct visual information, which
hinders the accurate evaluation of embodied agents based on Vision-Language
Models (VLMs). Second, they use a single, static viewpoint for environmental
observation, which restricts the agents' free exploration and cause the
omission of certain safety hazards, especially those that are occluded from a
fixed viewpoint. To alleviate these issues, we propose HomeSafeBench, a
benchmark with 12,900 data points covering five common home safety hazards:
fire, electric shock, falling object, trips, and child safety. HomeSafeBench
provides dynamic first-person perspective images from simulated home
environments, enabling the evaluation of VLM capabilities for home safety
inspection. By allowing the embodied agents to freely explore the room,
HomeSafeBench provides multiple dynamic perspectives in complex environments
for a more thorough inspection. Our comprehensive evaluation of mainstream VLMs
on HomeSafeBench reveals that even the best-performing model achieves an
F1-score of only 10.23%, demonstrating significant limitations in current VLMs.

### [145] [Confidence Aware SSD Ensemble with Weighted Boxes Fusion for Weapon Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23697)
*Atharva Jadhav,Arush Karekar,Manas Divekar,Shachi Natu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 通过集成多种骨干网络的SSD模型并使用加权框融合(WBF)方法，显著提升了武器检测在复杂环境下的鲁棒性，mAP达到0.838，比最佳单模型提升2.948%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 公共空间安全监控需要能准确检测武器的系统，但现有单模型检测器在部分遮挡、光照变化和复杂背景等挑战性条件下缺乏鲁棒性。

Method: 使用VGG16、ResNet50、EfficientNet和MobileNetV3等不同骨干网络训练多个SSD模型，然后通过加权框融合(WBF)方法集成这些模型的预测结果。

Result: 采用'max'置信度评分策略的WBF方法实现了0.838的mAP，相比最佳单模型相对提升2.948%，且始终优于其他融合启发式方法。

Conclusion: 研究表明融合策略与集成多样性同等重要，置信度感知融合是提升集成模型准确性的关键机制，为监控应用中的实时武器检测提供了鲁棒方法。

Abstract: The safety and security of public spaces is of vital importance, driving the
need for sophisticated surveillance systems capable of accurately detecting
weapons, which are often hampered by issues like partial occlusion, varying
lighting, and cluttered backgrounds. While single-model detectors are advanced,
they often lack robustness in these challenging conditions. This paper presents
the hypothesis that ensemble of Single Shot Multibox Detector (SSD) models with
diverse feature extraction backbones can significantly enhance detection
robustness. To leverage diverse feature representations, individual SSD models
were trained using a selection of backbone networks: VGG16, ResNet50,
EfficientNet, and MobileNetV3. The study is conducted on a dataset consisting
of images of three distinct weapon classes: guns, heavy weapons and knives. The
predictions from these models are combined using the Weighted Boxes Fusion
(WBF) method, an ensemble technique designed to optimize bounding box accuracy.
Our key finding is that the fusion strategy is as critical as the ensemble's
diversity, a WBF approach using a 'max' confidence scoring strategy achieved a
mean Average Precision (mAP) of 0.838. This represents a 2.948% relative
improvement over the best-performing single model and consistently outperforms
other fusion heuristics. This research offers a robust approach to enhancing
real-time weapon detection capabilities in surveillance applications by
demonstrating that confidence-aware fusion is a key mechanism for improving
accuracy metrics of ensembles.

*Yunjiang Xu,Lingzhi Li,Jin Wang,Yupeng Ouyang,Benyuan Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: INSTINCT是一个基于实例级交互的协作感知框架，通过质量感知过滤、双分支检测路由和跨智能体本地实例融合等组件，在显著降低通信带宽的同时提升检测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决协作感知系统中频繁交互和实时需求带来的带宽约束问题，同时填补LiDAR聚焦实现中性能不足的空白。

Method: 提出INSTINCT框架，包含三个核心组件：质量感知过滤机制、双分支检测路由方案和跨智能体本地实例融合模块，并改进了GT采样技术。

Result: 在DAIR-V2X和V2V4Real数据集上，准确率分别提升13.23%和33.08%，同时通信带宽降至最先进方法的1/281和1/264。

Conclusion: INSTINCT在显著降低通信带宽的同时实现了优越的性能，为协作感知系统提供了高效的实例级交互解决方案。

Abstract: Collaborative perception systems overcome single-vehicle limitations in
long-range detection and occlusion scenarios by integrating multi-agent sensory
data, improving accuracy and safety. However, frequent cooperative interactions
and real-time requirements impose stringent bandwidth constraints. Previous
works proves that query-based instance-level interaction reduces bandwidth
demands and manual priors, however, LiDAR-focused implementations in
collaborative perception remain underdeveloped, with performance still trailing
state-of-the-art approaches. To bridge this gap, we propose INSTINCT
(INSTance-level INteraCtion ArchiTecture), a novel collaborative perception
framework featuring three core components: 1) a quality-aware filtering
mechanism for high-quality instance feature selection; 2) a dual-branch
detection routing scheme to decouple collaboration-irrelevant and
collaboration-relevant instances; and 3) a Cross Agent Local Instance Fusion
module to aggregate local hybrid instance features. Additionally, we enhance
the ground truth (GT) sampling technique to facilitate training with diverse
hybrid instance features. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets
demonstrate that INSTINCT achieves superior performance. Specifically, our
method achieves an improvement in accuracy 13.23%/33.08% in DAIR-V2X and
V2V4Real while reducing the communication bandwidth to 1/281 and 1/264 compared
to state-of-the-art methods. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CrimEdit是一个统一的扩散模型，通过联合训练移除和插入任务嵌入，利用无分类器引导技术来增强物体移除效果和可控效果合成，并支持单步物体移动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理物体效果（如阴影和反射）时使用反事实数据集训练的扩散模型，但无分类器引导在统一模型中处理物体效果的性能影响尚未充分探索。

Method: 联合训练移除和插入任务嵌入，在无分类器引导方案中利用这些嵌入，增强物体及其效果的移除，并实现插入时物体效果的可控合成。

Result: CrimEdit实现了优越的物体移除、可控效果插入和高效的物体移动，无需额外训练或分离的移除和插入阶段。

Conclusion: 通过联合任务训练和引导技术，CrimEdit在复合编辑中实现了高效且高质量的性能。

Abstract: Recent works on object removal and insertion have enhanced their performance
by handling object effects such as shadows and reflections, using diffusion
models trained on counterfactual datasets. However, the performance impact of
applying classifier-free guidance to handle object effects across removal and
insertion tasks within a unified model remains largely unexplored. To address
this gap and improve efficiency in composite editing, we propose CrimEdit,
which jointly trains the task embeddings for removal and insertion within a
single model and leverages them in a classifier-free guidance scheme --
enhancing the removal of both objects and their effects, and enabling
controllable synthesis of object effects during insertion. CrimEdit also
extends these two task prompts to be applied to spatially distinct regions,
enabling object movement (repositioning) within a single denoising step. By
employing both guidance techniques, extensive experiments show that CrimEdit
achieves superior object removal, controllable effect insertion, and efficient
object movement without requiring additional training or separate removal and
insertion stages.

TL;DR: PD-Diag-Net是一种端到端的帕金森病自动诊断方法，直接从原始MRI扫描进行风险评估和辅助诊断，通过整合临床先验知识和脑区特征聚合，在外部测试中达到86%准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 帕金森病诊断流程复杂，严重依赖神经科医生经验，导致早期检测延迟和及时干预机会错失。需要开发自动化诊断方法来改善这一状况。

Method: 提出PD-Diag-Net框架，包括MRI预处理模块、脑区相关性先验和脑区老化先验，设计相关性先验引导的特征聚合模块和年龄先验引导的诊断模块。

Result: 在外部测试数据上达到86%准确率，早期诊断准确率超过96%，比现有先进方法提升超过20%。

Conclusion: PD-Diag-Net通过整合临床先验知识，在帕金森病自动诊断方面表现出色，具有高准确率和临床可解释性。

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder that severely
diminishes patients' quality of life. Its global prevalence has increased
markedly in recent decades. Current diagnostic workflows are complex and
heavily reliant on neurologists' expertise, often resulting in delays in early
detection and missed opportunities for timely intervention. To address these
issues, we propose an end-to-end automated diagnostic method for PD, termed
PD-Diag-Net, which performs risk assessment and auxiliary diagnosis directly
from raw MRI scans. This framework first introduces an MRI Pre-processing
Module (MRI-Processor) to mitigate inter-subject and inter-scanner variability
by flexibly integrating established medical imaging preprocessing tools. It
then incorporates two forms of clinical prior knowledge: (1)
Brain-Region-Relevance-Prior (Relevance-Prior), which specifies brain regions
strongly associated with PD; and (2) Brain-Region-Aging-Prior (Aging-Prior),
which reflects the accelerated aging typically observed in PD-associated
regions. Building on these priors, we design two dedicated modules: the
Relevance-Prior Guided Feature Aggregation Module (Aggregator), which guides
the model to focus on PD-associated regions at the inter-subject level, and the
Age-Prior Guided Diagnosis Module (Diagnoser), which leverages brain age gaps
as auxiliary constraints at the intra-subject level to enhance diagnostic
accuracy and clinical interpretability. Furthermore, we collected external test
data from our collaborating hospital. Experimental results show that
PD-Diag-Net achieves 86\% accuracy on external tests and over 96% accuracy in
early-stage diagnosis, outperforming existing advanced methods by more than
20%.

TL;DR: DiffPCN是一个基于扩散模型的从粗到精的点云补全框架，通过深度图像生成和点云优化两阶段方法，实现了高质量的点云补全。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 潜在扩散模型在低级视觉任务中表现出强大的生成能力，但由于点云的无结构和不规则特性，其在点云补全中的应用尚未充分探索。

Method: 采用两阶段框架：第一阶段将部分点云投影为深度图像，使用DepthLDM生成完整的多视角深度图像形成粗点云；第二阶段通过点去噪网络去除异常值，并使用关联感知点上采样器进行细化。

Result: 实验结果表明，DiffPCN在几何精度和形状完整性方面达到了最先进的性能，显著提高了点云补全的鲁棒性和一致性。

Conclusion: DiffPCN通过结合扩散模型的强大生成能力和精心设计的点云优化策略，成功解决了点云补全的挑战，为不规则数据的生成任务提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Latent diffusion models (LDMs) have demonstrated remarkable generative
capabilities across various low-level vision tasks. However, their potential
for point cloud completion remains underexplored due to the unstructured and
irregular nature of point clouds. In this work, we propose DiffPCN, a novel
diffusion-based coarse-to-fine framework for point cloud completion. Our
approach comprises two stages: an initial stage for generating coarse point
clouds, and a refinement stage that improves their quality through point
denoising and upsampling. Specifically, we first project the unordered and
irregular partial point cloud into structured depth images, which serve as
conditions for a well-designed DepthLDM to synthesize completed multi-view
depth images that are used to form coarse point clouds. In this way, our
DiffPCN can yield high-quality and high-completeness coarse point clouds by
leveraging LDM' s powerful generation and comprehension capabilities. Then,
since LDMs inevitably introduce outliers into the generated depth maps, we
design a Point Denoising Network to remove artifacts from the coarse point
cloud by predicting a per-point distance score. Finally, we devise an
Association-Aware Point Upsampler, which guides the upsampling process by
leveraging local association features between the input point cloud and the
corresponding coarse points, further yielding a dense and high-fidelity output.
Experimental results demonstrate that our DiffPCN achieves state-of-the-art
performance in geometric accuracy and shape completeness, significantly
improving the robustness and consistency of point cloud completion.

Method: 提出训练免费、参数免费、模型无关的视觉提示策略，将多个视频帧组合成单个面板图像，有效平衡空间细节和时间分辨率。

Conclusion: 该方法为长视频理解模型设立了新的性能基准，能够无缝集成到现有视频语言模型中。

Abstract: Recent Video-Language Models (VLMs) achieve promising results on long-video
understanding, but their performance still lags behind that achieved on tasks
involving images or short videos. This has led to great interest in improving
the long context modeling of VLMs by introducing novel modules and additional
complexity. % additional training time. In this paper, we take a different
approach: rather than fine-tuning VLMs with the limited data available, we
attempt to maximize the performance of existing models. To this end, we propose
a novel visual prompting strategy specifically designed for long-video
understanding. By combining multiple frames as panels into one image, we
effectively trade off spatial details for temporal resolution. Our approach is
training-free, parameter-free, and model-agnostic, and can be seamlessly
integrated into existing VLMs. Extensive experiments on five established
benchmarks across a wide range of model architectures, sizes, and context
windows confirm the consistency of our approach. For the TimeScope (Long)
dataset, which has the longest videos, the accuracy for video question
answering is improved by up to 19.4\%. Overall, our method raises the bar for
long video understanding models. We will make our code available upon
acceptance.

Motivation: 当前3D室内布局生成模型受限于现有数据集的规模、多样性和标注质量不足，需要更丰富的数据资源来提升学习能力。

Method: 构建了包含真实扫描、专业CAD设计和程序生成场景的多源数据集，每个布局配有全局场景摘要、大型家具关系放置和细粒度小物品排列的结构化文本描述。

Conclusion: M3DLayout可作为推进文本驱动3D场景合成研究的有价值资源，能够生成更复杂和详细的场景。

Abstract: In text-driven 3D scene generation, object layout serves as a crucial
intermediate representation that bridges high-level language instructions with
detailed geometric output. It not only provides a structural blueprint for
ensuring physical plausibility but also supports semantic controllability and
interactive editing. However, the learning capabilities of current 3D indoor
layout generation models are constrained by the limited scale, diversity, and
annotation quality of existing datasets. To address this, we introduce
M3DLayout, a large-scale, multi-source dataset for 3D indoor layout generation.
M3DLayout comprises 15,080 layouts and over 258k object instances, integrating
three distinct sources: real-world scans, professional CAD designs, and
procedurally generated scenes. Each layout is paired with detailed structured
text describing global scene summaries, relational placements of large
furniture, and fine-grained arrangements of smaller items. This diverse and
richly annotated resource enables models to learn complex spatial and semantic
patterns across a wide variety of indoor environments. To assess the potential
of M3DLayout, we establish a benchmark using a text-conditioned diffusion
model. Experimental results demonstrate that our dataset provides a solid
foundation for training layout generation models. Its multi-source composition
enhances diversity, notably through the Inf3DLayout subset which provides rich
small-object information, enabling the generation of more complex and detailed
scenes. We hope that M3DLayout can serve as a valuable resource for advancing
research in text-driven 3D scene synthesis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了LUQ（Layerwise Ultra-Low Bit Quantization），一种针对多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的超低比特量化方法，通过选择性对量化容忍度更高的层应用超低比特量化，在保持性能的同时显著减少内存使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型部署需要巨大内存和计算资源，虽然后训练量化（PTQ）已成功将语言模型压缩至1比特，但其在多模态模型中的有效性尚未充分探索。

Method: 提出LUQ策略：分析发现多模态token激活分布在不同层间差异显著，某些层具有更低熵的激活分布，对这些层选择性应用超低比特量化；同时使用混合多模态token进行PTQ提升VQA性能。

Result: 在LLaVA-1.5和Qwen-2.5-VL上的评估显示，LUQ模型比4位量化模型分别减少40%和31%内存使用，在MME基准上性能下降小于10%。

Conclusion: LUQ方法有效解决了多模态大语言模型的超低比特量化挑战，为资源受限环境下的部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) with multimodal capabilities have revolutionized
vision-language tasks, but their deployment often requires huge memory and
computational resources. While post-training quantization (PTQ) has
successfully compressed language models to as low as 1-bit precision without
significant performance loss, its effectiveness for multimodal LLMs (MLLMs)
remains relatively unexplored. In this paper, we present the first study on
ultra-low bit (<4-bit) quantization for multimodal LLMs. Our analysis reveals
that multimodal tokens and intermediate layer activations produced by them
exhibit significantly higher statistical variance and entropy compared to text
tokens, making them less tolerant to ultra-low bit quantization. However, the
activation distributions of multimodal tokens varies significantly over
different layers, with some layers having lower entropy activation
distributions. We empirically show that such layers in these models can better
tolerate ultra-low bit quantization. Building on these insights, we propose a
novel strategy for MLLM quantization, LUQ: Layerwise Ultra-Low Bit
Quantization, which selectively applies ultra-low bit quantization to layers
that are more resilient to it. Additionally, we also show that using a mix of
multimodal tokens (image and text) for PTQ boosts VQA performance in the
ultra-low bit regime. We evaluate our method on LLaVA-1.5 and Qwen-2.5-VL
across 9 popular VQA benchmarks. The resulting LUQ models use 40% and 31% less
memory than their 4-bit counterparts, respectively, while exhibiting a
performance degradation of less than 10% on the MME benchmark.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HieraTok是一个基于Vision Transformer的多尺度视觉分词器，通过多尺度下采样和尺度因果注意力机制，在图像重建和生成任务中显著优于单尺度方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统单尺度表示建模的固有局限性，通过多尺度表示来更好地捕捉图像的全局语义特征和局部结构细节。

Method: 采用两种关键设计：(1) 对分词器编码器生成的token图应用多尺度下采样，产生多尺度token序列；(2) 尺度因果注意力机制，实现从低分辨率全局特征到高分辨率结构细节的信息渐进流动。

Result: 在相同设置下，多尺度视觉分词器比单尺度对应物在rFID上提升27.2%(1.47→1.07)；在下游生成框架中实现1.38倍更快的收敛速度和18.9%的gFID提升(16.4→13.3)；通过扩大训练规模，在ViT分词器中达到sota的rFID 0.45和gFID 1.82。

Conclusion: HieraTok是首个在图像重建和生成中引入多尺度ViT分词器的方法，其发现和设计有望推动基于ViT的分词器在视觉生成任务中的发展。

Abstract: In this work, we present HieraTok, a novel multi-scale Vision Transformer
(ViT)-based tokenizer that overcomes the inherent limitation of modeling
single-scale representations. This is realized through two key designs: (1)
multi-scale downsampling applied to the token map generated by the tokenizer
encoder, producing a sequence of multi-scale tokens, and (2) a scale-causal
attention mechanism that enables the progressive flow of information from
low-resolution global semantic features to high-resolution structural details.
Coupling these designs, HieraTok achieves significant improvements in both
image reconstruction and generation tasks. Under identical settings, the
multi-scale visual tokenizer outperforms its single-scale counterpart by a
27.2\% improvement in rFID ($1.47 \rightarrow 1.07$). When integrated into
downstream generation frameworks, it achieves a $1.38\times$ faster convergence
rate and an 18.9\% boost in gFID ($16.4 \rightarrow 13.3$), which may be
attributed to the smoother and more uniformly distributed latent space.
Furthermore, by scaling up the tokenizer's training, we demonstrate its
potential by a sota rFID of 0.45 and a gFID of 1.82 among ViT tokenizers. To
the best of our knowledge, we are the first to introduce multi-scale ViT-based
tokenizer in image reconstruction and image generation. We hope our findings
and designs advance the ViT-based tokenizers in visual generation tasks.

<details>

Motivation: 现有单类别和多类别异常检测方法在新类别上表现不佳，主要原因是特征表示学习仍然与类别相关（特征相关性）。

Method: 1. 学习残差特征分布而非初始特征分布；2. 提出特征超球约束方法使不同类别的特征尺度一致；3. 使用对数障碍双向收缩OCC损失和基于向量量化的特征分布匹配模块。

Result: 在8个真实世界异常检测数据集上的实验表明，ResAD++在新类别上能取得显著的异常检测结果，优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: ResAD++通过特征解相关和尺度一致性约束，有效解决了类无关异常检测问题，具有很好的泛化能力。

Abstract: This paper explores the problem of class-agnostic anomaly detection (AD),
where the objective is to train one class-agnostic AD model that can generalize
to detect anomalies in diverse new classes from different domains without any
retraining or fine-tuning on the target data. When applied for new classes, the
performance of current single- and multi-class AD methods is still
unsatisfactory. One fundamental reason is that representation learning in
existing methods is still class-related, namely, feature correlation. To
address this issue, we propose residual features and construct a simple but
effective framework, termed ResAD. Our core insight is to learn the residual
feature distribution rather than the initial feature distribution. Residual
features are formed by matching and then subtracting normal reference features.
In this way, we can effectively realize feature decorrelation. Even in new
classes, the distribution of normal residual features would not remarkably
shift from the learned distribution. In addition, we think that residual
features still have one issue: scale correlation. To this end, we propose a
feature hypersphere constraining approach, which learns to constrain initial
normal residual features into a spatial hypersphere for enabling the feature
scales of different classes as consistent as possible. Furthermore, we propose
a novel logbarrier bidirectional contraction OCC loss and vector quantization
based feature distribution matching module to enhance ResAD, leading to the
improved version of ResAD (ResAD++). Comprehensive experiments on eight
real-world AD datasets demonstrate that our ResAD++ can achieve remarkable AD
results when directly used in new classes, outperforming state-of-the-art
competing methods and also surpassing ResAD. The code is available at

Conclusion: Poivre方法通过自我精炼过程和强化学习训练，有效提升了视觉语言模型在视觉指向任务上的性能，为未来研究提供了代码、数据集和模型检查点。

Abstract: Visual pointing, which aims to localize a target by predicting its
coordinates on an image, has emerged as an important problem in the realm of
vision-language models (VLMs). Despite its broad applicability, recent
benchmarks show that current VLMs still fall far behind human performance on
this task. A key limitation is that VLMs are typically required to complete the
pointing task in a single step, akin to asking humans to point at an object
without seeing their own fingers. To address this issue, we propose a simple
yet effective self-refining procedure: Point, Visualize, then Refine (Poivre).
This procedure enables a VLM to first mark its estimated point, then
iteratively refine the coordinates if necessary. Inspired by advances of
reasoning models in the natural language domain, we employ reinforcement
learning (RL) to incentivize this self-refining ability. For the RL training,
we design a neat process reward that is not only empirically effective but also
grounded in appealing properties. Our trained model, Poivre-7B, sets a new
state of the art on Point-Bench, outperforming both proprietary models such as
Gemini-2.5-Pro and large open-source models such as Molmo-72B by over 3%. To
support future research, we release our training and inference code, dataset,
and the Poivre-7B checkpoint.

Abstract: Colorectal cancer ranks among the most common and deadly cancers, emphasizing
the need for effective early detection and treatment. To address the
limitations of traditional colonoscopy, including high miss rates due to polyp
variability, we introduce the Pyramid Vision Transformer Adapter Residual
Network (PVTAdpNet). This model integrates a U-Net-style encoder-decoder
structure with a Pyramid Vision Transformer backbone, novel residual blocks,
and adapter-based skip connections. The design enhances feature extraction,
dense prediction, and gradient flow, supported by squeeze-and-excitation
attention for improved channel-wise feature refinement. PVTAdpNet achieves
real-time, accurate polyp segmentation, demonstrating superior performance on
benchmark datasets with high mDice and mIoU scores, making it highly suitable
for clinical applications. PVTAdpNet obtains a high Dice coefficient of 0.8851
and a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 0.8167 on out-of-distribution
polyp datasets. Evaluation of the PolypGen dataset demonstrates PVTAdpNet's

Abstract: The remarkable success of diffusion models in text-to-image generation has
sparked growing interest in expanding their capabilities to a variety of
multi-modal tasks, including image understanding, manipulation, and perception.
These tasks require advanced semantic comprehension across both visual and
textual modalities, especially in scenarios involving complex semantic
instructions. However, existing approaches often rely heavily on
vision-language models (VLMs) or modular designs for semantic guidance, leading
to fragmented architectures and computational inefficiency. To address these
challenges, we propose UniAlignment, a unified multimodal generation framework
within a single diffusion transformer. UniAlignment introduces a dual-stream
diffusion training strategy that incorporates both intrinsic-modal semantic
alignment and cross-modal semantic alignment, thereby enhancing the model's
cross-modal consistency and instruction-following robustness. Additionally, we
present SemGen-Bench, a new benchmark specifically designed to evaluate
multimodal semantic consistency under complex textual instructions. Extensive
experiments across multiple tasks and benchmarks demonstrate that UniAlignment
outperforms existing baselines, underscoring the significant potential of
diffusion models in unified multimodal generation.

*Xiaojie Li,Bei Wang,Jianlong Wu,Yue Yu,Liqiang Nie,Min Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GenView++是一个统一的对比学习框架，通过多源自适应视图生成机制和基于质量的对比学习机制，解决了正样本对构建质量差和训练监督不均衡的问题，在视觉和视觉语言任务上取得了显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对比学习方法在正样本对构建方面存在多样性不足和语义损坏风险，在学习方面缺乏质量评估机制导致所有样本对被平等对待，造成监督信号不理想。

Method: 1. 多源自适应视图生成：通过动态调节图像条件、文本条件和图像-文本条件策略的生成参数，合成多样且语义一致的视图；2. 质量驱动的对比学习：评估每个样本对的语义对齐度和多样性，动态重新加权其训练贡献，优先处理高质量样本对，抑制冗余或不对齐的样本对。

Result: 在视觉表示学习中，将MoCov2在ImageNet线性分类上的性能提升了+2.5%；在视觉语言学习中，在十个数据集上的平均零样本分类准确率比CLIP提高了+12.31%，比SLIP提高了+5.31%，Flickr30k文本检索R@5提升了+3.2%。

Conclusion: GenView++通过改进正样本对构建质量和引入质量感知的训练机制，显著提升了对比学习在视觉和视觉语言任务上的性能，证明了同时解决构建和学习两方面问题的重要性。

Abstract: The success of contrastive learning depends on the construction and
utilization of high-quality positive pairs. However, current methods face
critical limitations on two fronts: on the construction side, both handcrafted
and generative augmentations often suffer from limited diversity and risk
semantic corruption; on the learning side, the absence of a quality assessment
mechanism leads to suboptimal supervision where all pairs are treated equally.
To tackle these challenges, we propose GenView++, a unified framework that
addresses both fronts by introducing two synergistic innovations. To improve
pair construction, GenView++ introduces a multi-source adaptive view generation
mechanism to synthesize diverse yet semantically coherent views by dynamically
modulating generative parameters across image-conditioned, text-conditioned,
and image-text-conditioned strategies. Second, a quality-driven contrastive
learning mechanism assesses each pair's semantic alignment and diversity to
dynamically reweight their training contribution, prioritizing high-quality
pairs while suppressing redundant or misaligned pairs. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of GenView++ across both vision and
vision-language tasks. For vision representation learning, it improves MoCov2
by +2.5% on ImageNet linear classification. For vision-language learning, it
raises the average zero-shot classification accuracy by +12.31% over CLIP and
+5.31% over SLIP across ten datasets, and further improves Flickr30k text
retrieval R@5 by +3.2%. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MTGRR是一个针对城市区域表示的多模态图建模框架，通过模态定制化图神经网络和空间感知的多模态融合机制，解决了现有方法在跨模态统一架构和空间异质性忽略方面的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图模型在处理多模态城市数据时存在两个主要问题：(1) 对所有模态使用相同的图神经网络架构，无法捕捉模态特定结构；(2) 融合阶段忽略空间异质性，假设不同模态的聚合权重在所有区域保持不变。

Method: 将模态分为聚合级和点级两类，分别采用专家混合图架构和双级GNN处理；设计空间感知多模态融合机制动态推断区域特定的模态融合权重；采用联合对比学习策略优化区域表示。

Result: 在两个真实世界数据集上，跨越六种模态和三个任务的实验表明，MTGRR始终优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: MTGRR通过模态定制化图建模和空间感知融合机制，能够有效学习城市区域表示，在多模态城市数据分析任务中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Graph-based models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for modeling
multimodal urban data and learning region representations for various
downstream tasks. However, existing approaches face two major limitations. (1)
They typically employ identical graph neural network architectures across all
modalities, failing to capture modality-specific structures and
characteristics. (2) During the fusion stage, they often neglect spatial
heterogeneity by assuming that the aggregation weights of different modalities
remain invariant across regions, resulting in suboptimal representations. To
address these issues, we propose MTGRR, a modality-tailored graph modeling
framework for urban region representation, built upon a multimodal dataset
comprising point of interest (POI), taxi mobility, land use, road element,
remote sensing, and street view images. (1) MTGRR categorizes modalities into
two groups based on spatial density and data characteristics: aggregated-level
and point-level modalities. For aggregated-level modalities, MTGRR employs a
mixture-of-experts (MoE) graph architecture, where each modality is processed
by a dedicated expert GNN to capture distinct modality-specific
characteristics. For the point-level modality, a dual-level GNN is constructed
to extract fine-grained visual semantic features. (2) To obtain effective
region representations under spatial heterogeneity, a spatially-aware
multimodal fusion mechanism is designed to dynamically infer region-specific
modality fusion weights. Building on this graph modeling framework, MTGRR
further employs a joint contrastive learning strategy that integrates region
aggregated-level, point-level, and fusion-level objectives to optimize region
representations. Experiments on two real-world datasets across six modalities
and three tasks demonstrate that MTGRR consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines, validating its effectiveness.

TL;DR: 提出纹理向量量化和重建感知预测策略，解决现有VQ方法量化误差大和代码级监督训练导致次优先验建模的问题，实现高质量超分辨率重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VQ方法在视觉特征编码时存在较大量化误差，且使用代码级监督训练预测器无法考虑最终重建误差，导致先验建模精度不足。

Method: 1. 纹理向量量化：利用超分辨率任务特性，仅对缺失纹理引入码本建模先验；2. 重建感知预测：使用直通估计器直接通过图像级监督训练索引预测器。

Result: 提出的TVQ&RAP生成式SR模型能够以较小计算成本实现照片级真实感的超分辨率结果。

Conclusion: 通过纹理向量量化和重建感知预测策略，有效解决了VQ方法的量化误差和训练监督问题，实现了高质量的超分辨率重建。

Abstract: Vector-quantized based models have recently demonstrated strong potential for
visual prior modeling. However, existing VQ-based methods simply encode visual
features with nearest codebook items and train index predictor with code-level
supervision. Due to the richness of visual signal, VQ encoding often leads to
large quantization error. Furthermore, training predictor with code-level
supervision can not take the final reconstruction errors into consideration,
result in sub-optimal prior modeling accuracy. In this paper we address the
above two issues and propose a Texture Vector-Quantization and a Reconstruction
Aware Prediction strategy. The texture vector-quantization strategy leverages
the task character of super-resolution and only introduce codebook to model the
prior of missing textures. While the reconstruction aware prediction strategy
makes use of the straight-through estimator to directly train index predictor
with image-level supervision. Our proposed generative SR model (TVQ&RAP) is
able to deliver photo-realistic SR results with small computational cost.

TL;DR: GroupCoOp是一种参数高效的视觉语言模型微调方法，通过使用组特定文本提示来解决微调数据中子群不平衡导致的虚假相关性问题，提升模型的群体鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型参数高效微调方法容易受到微调数据中子群不平衡导致的虚假相关性的影响，导致模型对少数群体样本的识别能力下降。

Method: 提出Group Context Optimization (GroupCoOp)算法，使用组特定文本提示作为群体代表，为每个类别构建多个分类器。利用VLM文本编码器的丰富语义知识，即使对于训练样本较少的群体也能发现有效的组提示。

Result: 在五个基准测试和五种CLIP架构上取得了最佳结果，有时甚至优于微调整个网络的先前方法，而仅训练网络参数的0.016%。

Conclusion: GroupCoOp是一种简单有效的去偏微调算法，能够显著提升微调视觉语言模型的群体鲁棒性，同时保持参数高效性。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) of vision-language models (VLMs)
excels in various vision tasks thanks to the rich knowledge and generalization
ability of VLMs. However, recent studies revealed that such fine-tuned VLMs are
vulnerable to spurious correlations stemming from the subgroup imbalance in the
fine-tuning datasets. To resolve this issue, we propose Group Context
Optimization (GroupCoOp), a simple and effective debiased fine-tuning algorithm
that enhances the group robustness of fine-tuned VLMs. Its key idea is to
employ group-specific text prompts as group representatives serving as multiple
classifiers for their target class. The rich semantic knowledge of the text
encoder of VLM enables the discovery of effective group prompts even for groups
with a small number of training samples. Leveraging the group prompts for each
class addresses the issues caused by the group-imbalanced training set, such as
the neglect of minority groups and the scattered distribution of each class in
the embedding space. GroupCoOp achieved the best results on five benchmarks
across five CLIP architectures and occasionally outperformed prior methods that
fine-tune the entire network, despite training only 0.016\% of the network's
parameters.

Abstract: Procedural Content Generation (PCG) techniques enable automatic creation of
diverse and complex environments. While PCG facilitates more efficient content
creation, ensuring consistently high-quality, industry-standard content remains
a significant challenge. In this research, we propose a method to identify and
repair unstable levels generated by existing PCG models. We use Angry Birds as
a case study, demonstrating our method on game levels produced by established
PCG approaches. Our method leverages object segmentation and visual analysis of
level images to detect structural gaps and perform targeted repairs. We
evaluate multiple object segmentation models and select the most effective one
as the basis for our repair pipeline. Experimental results show that our method
improves the stability and playability of AI-generated levels. Although our
evaluation is specific to Angry Birds, our image-based approach is designed to
be applicable to a wide range of 2D games with similar level structures.

Abstract: Urban modeling is essential for city planning, scene synthesis, and gaming.
Existing image-based methods generate diverse layouts but often lack geometric
continuity and scalability, while graph-based methods capture structural
relations yet overlook parcel semantics. We present a controllable framework
for large-scale 3D vector urban layout generation, conditioned on both geometry
and semantics. By fusing geometric and semantic attributes, introducing edge
weights, and embedding building height in the graph, our method extends 2D
layouts to realistic 3D structures. It also enables users to directly control
the output by modifying semantic attributes. Experiments show that it produces
valid, large-scale urban models, offering an effective tool for data-driven

Abstract: Quality control is a critical aspect of manufacturing, particularly in
ensuring the proper assembly of small components in production lines. Existing
solutions often rely on single-view imaging or manual inspection, which are
prone to errors due to occlusions, restricted perspectives, or lighting
inconsistencies. These limitations require the installation of additional
inspection stations, which could disrupt the assembly line and lead to
increased downtime and costs. This paper introduces a novel multi-view quality
control module designed to address these challenges, integrating a multi-camera
imaging system with advanced object detection algorithms. By capturing images
from three camera views, the system provides comprehensive visual coverage of
components of an assembly process. A tailored image fusion methodology combines
results from multiple views, effectively resolving ambiguities and enhancing
detection reliability. To support this system, we developed a unique dataset
comprising annotated images across diverse scenarios, including varied lighting
conditions, occlusions, and angles, to enhance applicability in real-world
manufacturing environments. Experimental results show that our approach
significantly outperforms single-view methods, achieving high precision and
recall rates in the identification of improperly fastened small assembly parts
such as screws. This work contributes to industrial automation by overcoming
single-view limitations, and providing a scalable, cost-effective, and accurate
quality control mechanism that ensures the reliability and safety of the
assembly line. The dataset used in this study is publicly available to
facilitate further research in this domain.

Conclusion: 这项工作为未来研究提供了基础分类法，并对当前模型局限性进行了关键基准测试，表明迫切需要更强大、隐私感知的人工智能系统。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence have profoundly transformed the technological
landscape in recent years. Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated
impressive abilities in reasoning, text comprehension, contextual pattern
recognition, and integrating language with visual understanding. While these
advances offer significant benefits, they also reveal critical limitations in
the models' ability to grasp the notion of privacy. There is hence substantial
interest in determining if and how these models can understand and enforce
privacy principles, particularly given the lack of supporting resources to test
such a task. In this work, we address these challenges by examining how legal
frameworks can inform the capabilities of these emerging technologies. To this
end, we introduce a comprehensive, multi-level Visual Privacy Taxonomy that
captures a wide range of privacy issues, designed to be scalable and adaptable
to existing and future research needs. Furthermore, we evaluate the
capabilities of several state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models (VLMs),
revealing significant inconsistencies in their understanding of contextual
privacy. Our work contributes both a foundational taxonomy for future research
and a critical benchmark of current model limitations, demonstrating the urgent
need for more robust, privacy-aware AI systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D和4D方法在场景理解和生成任务上存在范式差距，无法在动态4D设置中联合处理这两个任务，特别是在需要时空建模的关键场景中。

Method: 1) 使用共享表示：提取语义特征用于理解，噪声注入外观特征用于生成，结合4D几何线索，通过自适应交叉注意力融合成时空感知的视觉表示；2) 使用共享架构：将自回归和扩散模型集成到单一LLM中，配备任务特定头部。

Result: 在多个基准测试上的广泛实验表明，Uni4D-LLM相比最先进模型取得了竞争性或更优的结果，并首次真正实现了4D场景理解和生成的统一。

Conclusion: Uni4D-LLM通过统一的视觉语言表示和架构，成功实现了4D场景理解和生成的联合处理，为物理世界的视觉语言模型应用提供了新范式。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in 2D
scene understanding and generation, but extending this unification to the
physical world remains an open challenge. Existing 3D and 4D approaches
typically embed scene geometry into autoregressive model for semantic
understanding and diffusion model for content generation. This paradigm gap
prevents a single model from jointly handling both tasks, especially in dynamic
4D settings where spatiotemporal modeling is critical. We propose Uni4D-LLM,
the first unified VLM framework with spatiotemporal awareness for 4D scene
understanding and generation. Our design is guided by two key insights: 1)
Unification requires a shared representation. We extract semantic features for
understanding and noisy-injected appearance features for generation,
incorporate 4D geometric cues, and fuse them into a spatiotemporal-aware visual
representation through adaptive cross-attention. 2) Unification requires a
shared architecture. Both autoregression and diffusion are built on Transformer
backbones, and this enables integration into a single LLM with task-specific
heads. By aligning visual and linguistic representations, our Uni4D-LLM
produces predictions for both understanding and generation within one
Transformer-based framework. We further apply instruction fine-tuning on
diverse 4D vision-language datasets to improve generalization across tasks.
Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that Uni4D-LLM
achieves competitive or superior results compared to state-of-the-art models
and offers the first true unification of 4D scene understanding and generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的半监督视频对象分割方法主要依赖外观模式匹配，在面对剧烈视觉变化、遮挡和场景转换等挑战时鲁棒性有限，缺乏对目标对象的高层次概念理解。

Method: 使用Segment Concept (SeC)框架，该框架利用大型视觉语言模型建立目标对象的深度语义理解，实现更持久的视频对象分割。

Result: 在MOSEv2测试集上，SeC在零样本设置下（未在训练集上微调）取得了39.7的JFn分数，在第七届大规模视频对象分割挑战的复杂VOS赛道中排名第二。

Conclusion: SeC框架通过引入大型视觉语言模型提供的深度语义理解，显著提升了半监督视频对象分割在复杂场景下的鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: Semi-supervised Video Object Segmentation aims to segment a specified target
throughout a video sequence, initialized by a first-frame mask. Previous
methods rely heavily on appearance-based pattern matching and thus exhibit
limited robustness against challenges such as drastic visual changes,
occlusions, and scene shifts. This failure is often attributed to a lack of
high-level conceptual understanding of the target. The recently proposed
Segment Concept (SeC) framework mitigated this limitation by using a Large
Vision-Language Model (LVLM) to establish a deep semantic understanding of the
object for more persistent segmentation. In this work, we evaluate its
zero-shot performance on the challenging coMplex video Object SEgmentation v2
(MOSEv2) dataset. Without any fine-tuning on the training set, SeC achieved
39.7 \JFn on the test set and ranked 2nd place in the Complex VOS track of the
7th Large-scale Video Object Segmentation Challenge.

Conclusion: T23D-CompBench和Rank2Score为文本到3D质量评估提供了全面基准和有效评估器，显著提升了与人类判断的一致性。

Abstract: Recent advances in Text-to-3D (T23D) generative models have enabled the
synthesis of diverse, high-fidelity 3D assets from textual prompts. However,
existing challenges restrict the development of reliable T23D quality
assessment (T23DQA). First, existing benchmarks are outdated, fragmented, and
coarse-grained, making fine-grained metric training infeasible. Moreover,
current objective metrics exhibit inherent design limitations, resulting in
non-representative feature extraction and diminished metric robustness. To
address these limitations, we introduce T23D-CompBench, a comprehensive
benchmark for compositional T23D generation. We define five components with
twelve sub-components for compositional prompts, which are used to generate
3,600 textured meshes from ten state-of-the-art generative models. A
large-scale subjective experiment is conducted to collect 129,600 reliable
human ratings across different perspectives. Based on T23D-CompBench, we
further propose Rank2Score, an effective evaluator with two-stage training for
T23DQA. Rank2Score enhances pairwise training via supervised contrastive
regression and curriculum learning in the first stage, and subsequently refines
predictions using mean opinion scores to achieve closer alignment with human
judgments in the second stage. Extensive experiments and downstream
applications demonstrate that Rank2Score consistently outperforms existing
metrics across multiple dimensions and can additionally serve as a reward
function to optimize generative models. The project is available at

Motivation: 现有方法难以同时展示图像分类器学习的概念、相关区域及其对预测的贡献，而概念解释方法虽然能分解AI预测为可理解概念，但缺乏综合解决方案。

Method: 使用分支网络共享图像分类器的激活映射，学习模仿视觉语言模型的嵌入，通过概念预测分数的梯度加权激活映射来表示概念区域，量化其对分类分数的影响。

Result: 定性和定量评估表明该方法优于现有方法，在未见概念的零样本推理方面表现优异，并引入了新的概念区域准确性评估指标。

Conclusion: CE-FAM提供了一个通用框架，能够识别概念区域及其贡献，同时利用VLM知识处理任意概念，无需标注数据集，在解释性和性能方面均表现优越。

Abstract: Although saliency maps can highlight important regions to explain the
reasoning behind image classification in artificial intelligence (AI), the
meaning of these regions is left to the user's interpretation. In contrast,
conceptbased explanations decompose AI predictions into humanunderstandable
concepts, clarifying their contributions. However, few methods can
simultaneously reveal what concepts an image classifier learns, which regions
are associated with them, and how they contribute to predictions. We propose a
novel concept-based explanation method, Concept-based Explanation via Fusion of
Activation Maps (CE-FAM). It employs a branched network that shares activation
maps with an image classifier and learns to mimic the embeddings of a Vision
and Language Model (VLM). The branch network predicts concepts in an image, and
their corresponding regions are represented by a weighted sum of activation
maps, with weights given by the gradients of the concept prediction scores.
Their contributions are quantified based on their impact on the image
classification score. Our method provides a general framework for identifying
the concept regions and their contributions while leveraging VLM knowledge to
handle arbitrary concepts without requiring an annotated dataset. Furthermore,
we introduce a novel evaluation metric to assess the accuracy of the concept
regions. Our qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate our method
outperforms existing approaches and excels in zero-shot inference for unseen
concepts.

application of deep learning, yet state-of-the-art models often exhibit
critical limitations, including architectural constraints, inherent demographic
biases, and a lack of transparency. Existing methods, primarily based on
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), excel at capturing local texture but
struggle with global facial harmony, while Vision Transformers (ViTs)
effectively model long-range dependencies but can miss fine-grained details.
Furthermore, models trained on benchmark datasets can inadvertently learn and
perpetuate societal biases related to protected attributes like ethnicity. To
address these interconnected challenges, we propose \textbf{FairViT-GAN}, a
novel hybrid framework that synergistically integrates a CNN branch for local
feature extraction and a ViT branch for global context modeling. More
significantly, we introduce an adversarial debiasing mechanism where the
feature extractor is explicitly trained to produce representations that are
invariant to protected attributes, thereby actively mitigating algorithmic
bias. Our framework's transparency is enhanced by visualizing the distinct
focus of each architectural branch. Extensive experiments on the SCUT-FBP5500
benchmark demonstrate that FairViT-GAN not only sets a new state-of-the-art in
predictive accuracy, achieving a Pearson Correlation of \textbf{0.9230} and
reducing RMSE to \textbf{0.2650}, but also excels in fairness. Our analysis
reveals a remarkable \textbf{82.9\% reduction in the performance gap} between
ethnic subgroups, with the adversary's classification accuracy dropping to
near-random chance (52.1\%). We believe FairViT-GAN provides a robust,
transparent, and significantly fairer blueprint for developing responsible AI
systems for subjective visual assessment.

### [171] [Sim-DETR: Unlock DETR for Temporal Sentence Grounding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23867)
*Jiajin Tang,Zhengxuan Wei,Yuchen Zhu,Cheng Shi,Guanbin Li,Liang Lin,Sibei Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Sim-DETR通过限制解码器中语义和位置重叠查询的自注意力，并添加查询到帧的对齐，解决了DETR在时序语句定位中的性能问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现典型DETR增强策略在时序语句定位任务中不仅没有提升性能，反而可能降低性能，需要分析根本原因并解决。

Method: 在DETR解码器层进行两个小修改：1) 基于语义和位置重叠约束查询间的自注意力；2) 添加查询到帧的对齐来桥接全局和局部上下文。

Result: Sim-DETR释放了DETR在时序语句定位中的全部潜力，为未来研究提供了强大的基线。

Conclusion: 通过解决查询冲突和全局-局部上下文张力问题，Sim-DETR成功提升了DETR在时序语句定位任务中的性能。

Abstract: Temporal sentence grounding aims to identify exact moments in a video that
correspond to a given textual query, typically addressed with detection
transformer (DETR) solutions. However, we find that typical strategies designed
to enhance DETR do not improve, and may even degrade, its performance in this
task. We systematically analyze and identify the root causes of this abnormal
behavior: (1) conflicts between queries from similar target moments and (2)
internal query conflicts due to the tension between global semantics and local
localization. Building on these insights, we propose a simple yet powerful
baseline, Sim-DETR, which extends the standard DETR with two minor
modifications in the decoder layers: (1) constraining self-attention between
queries based on their semantic and positional overlap and (2) adding
query-to-frame alignment to bridge the global and local contexts. Experiments
demonstrate that Sim-DETR unlocks the full potential of DETR for temporal
sentence grounding, offering a strong baseline for future research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出信息锚定引导(IGG)机制，通过注意力机制将引导信号锚定到语义重要区域，解决自回归图像生成模型中因渐进分辨率缩放导致的信息不一致问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归图像生成模型面临关键弱点：渐进分辨率缩放导致跨时间步的补丁间信息不一致，使引导信号偏离条件信息，产生模糊不忠实的特征。

Method: 开发信息锚定引导(IGG)机制，通过注意力自适应地强化信息丰富的补丁，在采样过程中确保引导与内容保持紧密对齐。

Result: 在类别条件和文本到图像生成任务中，IGG生成更清晰、更连贯且语义更准确的图像，为基于自回归的方法设立了新基准。

Conclusion: IGG通过锚定引导到语义重要区域，有效解决了自回归图像生成中的信息不一致问题，显著提升了生成质量。

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models based on next-scale prediction are rapidly
emerging as a powerful tool for image generation, but they face a critical
weakness: information inconsistencies between patches across timesteps
introduced by progressive resolution scaling. These inconsistencies scatter
guidance signals, causing them to drift away from conditioning information and
leaving behind ambiguous, unfaithful features. We tackle this challenge with
Information-Grounding Guidance (IGG), a novel mechanism that anchors guidance
to semantically important regions through attention. By adaptively reinforcing
informative patches during sampling, IGG ensures that guidance and content
remain tightly aligned. Across both class-conditioned and text-to-image
generation tasks, IGG delivers sharper, more coherent, and semantically
grounded images, setting a new benchmark for AR-based methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估指标无法捕捉多模态大语言模型在真实场景中对无关或干扰性视觉上下文的敏感性，这影响了模型的可靠性。

Method: 引入PCRI指标，系统测量模型在局部图像块和完整图像输入之间的性能变化，评估19个先进MLLM在15个视觉语言基准上的表现。

Result: 大多数领先模型对背景噪声仍很脆弱，只有InternVL2-26B和Qwen2VL-72B等少数模型在不同任务中表现出一致的鲁棒性。PCRI分析揭示了不同模型架构处理和整合视觉上下文的方式。

Conclusion: PCRI支持对上下文鲁棒性的严格比较，为研究人员和从业者提供可操作的诊断见解，指导未来架构和训练策略的开发，以实现稳健的实际部署。

Abstract: The reliability of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in real-world
settings is often undermined by sensitivity to irrelevant or distracting visual
context, an aspect not captured by existing evaluation metrics. We introduce
the \textbf{Patch Context Robustness Index (PCRI)}, the first systematic and
interpretable score for quantifying MLLM robustness to variations in visual
context granularity, measuring performance changes between localized image
patches and full-image input.
  Applying PCRI to 19 state-of-the-art MLLMs across 15 vision-language
benchmarks, we find that most leading models remain brittle to background
noise, with only a few, such as InternVL2-26B and Qwen2VL-72B, demonstrating
consistent robustness across tasks. PCRI analysis also highlights how different
model architectures handle and integrate visual context, offering actionable
diagnostic insight for both researchers and practitioners.
  PCRI enables rigorous comparison of context robustness, supporting principled
model selection and guiding the development of future architectures and
training strategies for robust, real-world deployment.

*Taehun Kong,Tae-Kyun Kim*

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的半监督3D目标检测框架，通过可学习的伪标签模块自动选择高质量伪标签，解决了传统方法依赖人工设定阈值的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有半监督3D目标检测方法在伪标签选择上存在不足，要么依赖人工设定阈值，要么忽视上下文信息，无法充分利用网络可用信息来评估伪标签质量。

Method: 在教师网络输出层引入两个网络，通过分数融合可靠评估伪标签质量并确定上下文自适应阈值，同时采用软监督策略在伪标签噪声下进行鲁棒学习。

Result: 在KITTI和Waymo数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法能选择高精度伪标签，同时保持更广泛的上下文覆盖和更高的召回率。

Conclusion: 所提方法显著改进了相关半监督3D目标检测方法，实现了自动化和自适应的伪标签选择。

Abstract: Semi-supervised 3D object detection (SS3DOD) aims to reduce costly 3D
annotations utilizing unlabeled data. Recent studies adopt pseudo-label-based
teacher-student frameworks and demonstrate impressive performance. The main
challenge of these frameworks is in selecting high-quality pseudo-labels from
the teacher's predictions. Most previous methods, however, select pseudo-labels
by comparing confidence scores over thresholds manually set. The latest works
tackle the challenge either by dynamic thresholding or refining the quality of
pseudo-labels. Such methods still overlook contextual information e.g. object
distances, classes, and learning states, and inadequately assess the
pseudo-label quality using partial information available from the networks. In
this work, we propose a novel SS3DOD framework featuring a learnable
pseudo-labeling module designed to automatically and adaptively select
high-quality pseudo-labels. Our approach introduces two networks at the teacher
output level. These networks reliably assess the quality of pseudo-labels by
the score fusion and determine context-adaptive thresholds, which are
supervised by the alignment of pseudo-labels over GT bounding boxes.
Additionally, we introduce a soft supervision strategy that can learn robustly
under pseudo-label noises. This helps the student network prioritize cleaner
labels over noisy ones in semi-supervised learning. Extensive experiments on
the KITTI and Waymo datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. The
proposed method selects high-precision pseudo-labels while maintaining a wider
coverage of contexts and a higher recall rate, significantly improving relevant
SS3DOD methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出SuperDiff方法，通过自监督上下文子数据和可调泛化扩散模型解决低剂量CT去噪问题，无需配对数据，在重建和泛化性能上优于现有方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于深度学习的低剂量CT去噪模型严重依赖配对数据且泛化能力差，扩散模型需要学习干净数据分布，在医学临床应用中难以满足；自监督方法面临从当前剂量预训练模型扩展到其他剂量时泛化能力显著下降的挑战

Method: 设计上下文子数据相似性自适应感知策略，结合知识蒸馏与潜在扩散模型进行图像细节优化，提出像素级自校正融合技术进行细粒度重建，灵活应用于上下剂量甚至未见剂量的泛化

Result: 在数据集和真实数据上的定性和定量评估显示，SuperDiff在重建和泛化性能上持续优于现有最先进方法

Conclusion: SuperDiff通过双域策略级联实现自监督低剂量CT去噪，仅需低剂量CT投影域数据进行训练和测试，具有良好的重建效果和泛化能力

Abstract: Current models based on deep learning for low-dose CT denoising rely heavily
on paired data and generalize poorly. Even the more concerned diffusion models
need to learn the distribution of clean data for reconstruction, which is
difficult to satisfy in medical clinical applications. At the same time,
self-supervised-based methods face the challenge of significant degradation of
generalizability of models pre-trained for the current dose to expand to other
doses. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel method of
tunable-generalization diffusion powered by self-supervised contextual sub-data
for low-dose CT reconstruction, named SuperDiff. Firstly, a contextual subdata
similarity adaptive sensing strategy is designed for denoising centered on the
LDCT projection domain, which provides an initial prior for the subsequent
progress. Subsequently, the initial prior is used to combine knowledge
distillation with a deep combination of latent diffusion models for optimizing
image details. The pre-trained model is used for inference reconstruction, and
the pixel-level self-correcting fusion technique is proposed for fine-grained
reconstruction of the image domain to enhance the image fidelity, using the
initial prior and the LDCT image as a guide. In addition, the technique is
flexibly applied to the generalization of upper and lower doses or even unseen
doses. Dual-domain strategy cascade for self-supervised LDCT denoising,
SuperDiff requires only LDCT projection domain data for training and testing.
Full qualitative and quantitative evaluations on both datasets and real data
show that SuperDiff consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods
in terms of reconstruction and generalization performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了AssemblyHands-X，首个用于双手机器活动的无标记3D手-身体基准数据集，研究手-身体协调对动作识别的影响，实验表明联合建模手和身体线索能提高动作识别性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 双人活动涉及双手和身体的协调运动，但这种协调对活动理解的影响尚未系统评估，因为缺乏合适的数据集。现有数据集要么只标注手部姿势，要么只标注身体姿势，或者使用标记式动作捕捉引入视觉伪影。

Method: 构建了从同步多视角视频进行3D姿势标注的流程，结合多视角三角测量和SMPL-X网格拟合，获得可靠的手部和上半身3D配准。验证了不同输入表示（视频、手部姿势、身体姿势、手-身体姿势）在基于图卷积或时空注意力的动作识别模型中的表现。

Result: 实验表明基于姿势的动作推理比视频基线更高效和准确。联合建模手和身体线索比单独使用手部或上半身能提高动作识别性能，突出了建模相互依赖的手-身体动态对双人活动整体理解的重要性。

Conclusion: AssemblyHands-X数据集填补了无标记3D手-身体基准的空白，证明了手-身体协调对双人活动理解的重要性，为未来研究提供了有价值的资源。

Abstract: Bimanual human activities inherently involve coordinated movements of both
hands and body. However, the impact of this coordination in activity
understanding has not been systematically evaluated due to the lack of suitable
datasets. Such evaluation demands kinematic-level annotations (e.g., 3D pose)
for the hands and body, yet existing 3D activity datasets typically annotate
either hand or body pose. Another line of work employs marker-based motion
capture to provide full-body pose, but the physical markers introduce visual
artifacts, thereby limiting models' generalization to natural, markerless
videos. To address these limitations, we present AssemblyHands-X, the first
markerless 3D hand-body benchmark for bimanual activities, designed to study
the effect of hand-body coordination for action recognition. We begin by
constructing a pipeline for 3D pose annotation from synchronized multi-view
videos. Our approach combines multi-view triangulation with SMPL-X mesh
fitting, yielding reliable 3D registration of hands and upper body. We then
validate different input representations (e.g., video, hand pose, body pose, or
hand-body pose) across recent action recognition models based on graph
convolution or spatio-temporal attention. Our extensive experiments show that
pose-based action inference is more efficient and accurate than video
baselines. Moreover, joint modeling of hand and body cues improves action
recognition over using hands or upper body alone, highlighting the importance
of modeling interdependent hand-body dynamics for a holistic understanding of
bimanual activities.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出跨模态对比遗忘(CCU)框架，通过选择性视觉遗忘、跨模态知识保留和双集对比分离三个组件，解决视觉模态隐私泄露问题，同时保持跨模态知识和类内结构稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实多模态应用中视觉模态最易泄露隐私，现有遗忘方法在视觉遗忘时会损害跨模态知识和保留数据的类内结构稳定性，导致整体性能下降。

Method: CCU框架包含：(a)选择性视觉遗忘：使用反向对比学习分离视觉表示与原始语义；(b)跨模态知识保留：通过语义一致性保持其他模态的区分性；(c)双集对比分离：通过隔离遗忘集和保留集的结构扰动来保持模型性能。

Result: 在三个数据集上的实验显示CCU优于现有方法，相比最佳基线实现了7.12%的准确率提升，且仅需7%的遗忘时间。

Conclusion: CCU框架能有效解决视觉模态隐私泄露问题，同时保持跨模态知识和模型性能，具有高效性和优越性。

Abstract: Visual modality is the most vulnerable to privacy leakage in real-world
multimodal applications like autonomous driving with visual and radar data;
Machine unlearning removes specific training data from pre-trained models to
address privacy leakage, however, existing methods fail to preserve cross-modal
knowledge and maintain intra-class structural stability of retain data, leading
to reduced overall and other modalities' performance during visual unlearning;
to address these challenges, we propose a Cross-modal Contrastive Unlearning
(CCU) framework, which integrates three key components: (a) selective visual
unlearning: employing inverse contrastive learning to dissociate visual
representations from their original semantics, (b) cross-modal knowledge
retention: preserving other modalities' discriminability through semantic
consistency, and (c) dual-set contrastive separation: preserving the model
performance via isolation of structural perturbations between the unlearn set
and retain set; extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate the
superiority of CCU, and our method achieves a 7.12% accuracy improvement with
only 7% of the unlearning time compared to the top-accuracy baseline.

Motivation: 解决需要同时理解图像和文本的临床难题是医疗AI的主要挑战，现有方法在复杂图像文本推理任务上仍有局限。

Method: 将医学图像和文本特征通过快速傅里叶变换转换到频域，结合量子检索系统从外部源获取医学事实，并将这些信息与频域特征融合进行推理。

Result: 在VQA-RAD数据集上的评估显示，Q-FSRU模型优于早期模型，特别是在需要图像文本推理的复杂案例中表现突出。

Conclusion: 频率和量子信息的结合提高了模型性能和可解释性，为构建智能、清晰且有用的医生AI工具提供了有前景的方法。

Abstract: Solving tough clinical questions that require both image and text
understanding is still a major challenge in healthcare AI. In this work, we
propose Q-FSRU, a new model that combines Frequency Spectrum Representation and
Fusion (FSRU) with a method called Quantum Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(Quantum RAG) for medical Visual Question Answering (VQA). The model takes in
features from medical images and related text, then shifts them into the
frequency domain using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). This helps it focus on
more meaningful data and filter out noise or less useful information. To
improve accuracy and ensure that answers are based on real knowledge, we add a
quantum inspired retrieval system. It fetches useful medical facts from
external sources using quantum-based similarity techniques. These details are
then merged with the frequency-based features for stronger reasoning. We
evaluated our model using the VQA-RAD dataset, which includes real radiology
images and questions. The results showed that Q-FSRU outperforms earlier
models, especially on complex cases needing image text reasoning. The mix of
frequency and quantum information improves both performance and explainability.
Overall, this approach offers a promising way to build smart, clear, and
helpful AI tools for doctors.

Result: 在CheXpert上达到0.851 AUROC，相比DER++减少遗忘超过30%，接近联合训练的0.869 AUROC，同时保持高效和隐私保护。

Conclusion: 分析表明遗忘与重放保真度和Fisher加权参数漂移相关，扩散重放和突触稳定性具有互补作用，为临床影像模型的可扩展隐私感知持续适应提供了实用路径。

Abstract: Medical imaging foundation models must adapt over time, yet full retraining
is often blocked by privacy constraints and cost. We present a continual
learning framework that avoids storing patient exemplars by pairing class
conditional diffusion replay with Elastic Weight Consolidation. Using a compact
Vision Transformer backbone, we evaluate across eight MedMNIST v2 tasks and
CheXpert. On CheXpert our approach attains 0.851 AUROC, reduces forgetting by
more than 30\% relative to DER\texttt{++}, and approaches joint training at
0.869 AUROC, while remaining efficient and privacy preserving. Analyses connect
forgetting to two measurable factors: fidelity of replay and Fisher weighted
parameter drift, highlighting the complementary roles of replay diffusion and
synaptic stability. The results indicate a practical route for scalable,
privacy aware continual adaptation of clinical imaging models.

Method: 提出联邦领域适应(FedDA)分割训练框架，通过嵌入对抗训练机制在客户端间进行特征级对抗学习，对齐特征映射。

Result: 在三个医疗图像数据集上的实验表明，FedDA能实现跨域联邦聚合，赋予单模态客户端跨模态处理能力，在客观和主观评估中均优于现有联邦聚合算法。

Conclusion: FedDA框架有效解决了联邦学习中医疗图像多模态分割的领域适应问题，提升了模型的跨域泛化性能。

Abstract: Federated learning enables collaborative training of machine learning models
among different clients while ensuring data privacy, emerging as the mainstream
for breaking data silos in the healthcare domain. However, the imbalance of
medical resources, data corruption or improper data preservation may lead to a
situation where different clients possess medical images of different modality.
This heterogeneity poses a significant challenge for cross-domain medical image
segmentation within the federated learning framework. To address this
challenge, we propose a new Federated Domain Adaptation (FedDA) segmentation
training framework. Specifically, we propose a feature-level adversarial
learning among clients by aligning feature maps across clients through
embedding an adversarial training mechanism. This design can enhance the
model's generalization on multiple domains and alleviate the negative impact
from domain-shift. Comprehensive experiments on three medical image datasets
demonstrate that our proposed FedDA substantially achieves cross-domain
federated aggregation, endowing single modality client with cross-modality
processing capabilities, and consistently delivers robust performance compared
to state-of-the-art federated aggregation algorithms in objective and
subjective assessment. Our code are available at

Motivation: 当前指令引导的图像编辑模型在处理复杂指令时面临挑战，需要多次尝试才能获得理想结果。强化学习提供了有前景的解决方案，但缺乏高质量、高效的奖励信号严重阻碍了其在图像编辑中的应用。

Method: 首先开发EditReward-Bench基准系统评估奖励模型；然后构建EditScore奖励模型系列（7B-72B），通过精心数据筛选和自集成策略；最后将高质量奖励模型应用于在线RL训练。

Result: EditScore在基准测试中表现优异，最大变体甚至超过GPT-5；结合OmniGen2基础模型进行RL训练后，模型性能获得显著且一致的提升。

Conclusion: 这项工作提供了从基准测试到奖励建模再到RL训练的系统路径，证明高质量、领域专业化的奖励模型是释放RL在图像编辑领域全部潜力的关键。

Abstract: Instruction-guided image editing has achieved remarkable progress, yet
current models still face challenges with complex instructions and often
require multiple samples to produce a desired result. Reinforcement Learning
(RL) offers a promising solution, but its adoption in image editing has been
severely hindered by the lack of a high-fidelity, efficient reward signal. In
this work, we present a comprehensive methodology to overcome this barrier,
centered on the development of a state-of-the-art, specialized reward model. We
first introduce EditReward-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark to systematically
evaluate reward models on editing quality. Building on this benchmark, we
develop EditScore, a series of reward models (7B-72B) for evaluating the
quality of instruction-guided image editing. Through meticulous data curation
and filtering, EditScore effectively matches the performance of learning
proprietary VLMs. Furthermore, coupled with an effective self-ensemble strategy
tailored for the generative nature of EditScore, our largest variant even
surpasses GPT-5 in the benchmark. We then demonstrate that a high-fidelity
reward model is the key to unlocking online RL for image editing. Our
experiments show that, while even the largest open-source VLMs fail to provide
an effective learning signal, EditScore enables efficient and robust policy
optimization. Applying our framework to a strong base model, OmniGen2, results
in a final model that shows a substantial and consistent performance uplift.
Overall, this work provides the first systematic path from benchmarking to
reward modeling to RL training in image editing, showing that a high-fidelity,
domain-specialized reward model is the key to unlocking the full potential of

Abstract: Modeling and generating human reactions poses a significant challenge with
broad applications for computer vision and human-computer interaction. Existing
methods either treat multiple individuals as a single entity, directly
generating interactions, or rely solely on one person's motion to generate the
other's reaction, failing to integrate the rich semantic information that
underpins human interactions. Yet, these methods often fall short in adaptive
responsiveness, i.e., the ability to accurately respond to diverse and dynamic
interaction scenarios. Recognizing this gap, our work introduces an approach
tailored to address the limitations of existing models by focusing on
text-driven human reaction generation. Our model specifically generates
realistic motion sequences for individuals that responding to the other's
actions based on a descriptive text of the interaction scenario. The goal is to
produce motion sequences that not only complement the opponent's movements but
also semantically fit the described interactions. To achieve this, we present
MoReact, a diffusion-based method designed to disentangle the generation of
global trajectories and local motions sequentially. This approach stems from
the observation that generating global trajectories first is crucial for
guiding local motion, ensuring better alignment with given action and text.
Furthermore, we introduce a novel interaction loss to enhance the realism of
generated close interactions. Our experiments, utilizing data adapted from a
two-person motion dataset, demonstrate the efficacy of our approach for this
novel task, which is capable of producing realistic, diverse, and controllable
reactions that not only closely match the movements of the counterpart but also
adhere to the textual guidance. Please find our webpage at

TL;DR: 本文通过系统实验分析多任务学习中的优化不平衡问题，发现任务特定梯度范数与优化不平衡强相关，提出基于梯度范数缩放任务损失的简单策略，可达到与昂贵网格搜索相当的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多任务学习(MTL)旨在通过单一网络联合执行多个任务来构建通用视觉系统，但其潜力常被"优化不平衡"问题阻碍，即任务干扰导致性能不如单任务模型。

Method: 进行系统实验分析，研究导致优化不平衡的因素，包括验证现有优化方法在不同数据集上的不一致性能，分析先进架构对网格搜索损失权重的依赖，评估视觉基础模型(VFMs)初始化和数据量的影响。

Result: 发现优化不平衡与任务特定梯度范数存在强相关性，基于梯度范数缩放任务损失的简单策略可达到与计算昂贵的网格搜索相当的性能。

Conclusion: 理解和控制梯度动态是比开发复杂方法更直接的实现稳定多任务学习的路径。

Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) aims to build general-purpose vision systems by
training a single network to perform multiple tasks jointly. While promising,
its potential is often hindered by "unbalanced optimization", where task
interference leads to subpar performance compared to single-task models. To
facilitate research in MTL, this paper presents a systematic experimental
analysis to dissect the factors contributing to this persistent problem. Our
investigation confirms that the performance of existing optimization methods
varies inconsistently across datasets, and advanced architectures still rely on
costly grid-searched loss weights. Furthermore, we show that while powerful
Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) provide strong initialization, they do not
inherently resolve the optimization imbalance, and merely increasing data
quantity offers limited benefits. A crucial finding emerges from our analysis:
a strong correlation exists between the optimization imbalance and the norm of
task-specific gradients. We demonstrate that this insight is directly
applicable, showing that a straightforward strategy of scaling task losses
according to their gradient norms can achieve performance comparable to that of
an extensive and computationally expensive grid search. Our comprehensive
analysis suggests that understanding and controlling gradient dynamics is a
more direct path to stable MTL than developing increasingly complex methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文系统分析了CLIP模型在多任务下的对抗样本迁移行为，发现细粒度任务生成的对抗样本具有更强的跨任务迁移能力，并提出了MT-AdvCLIP框架来增强对抗攻击效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP模型在细粒度任务上表现不佳，且其对抗鲁棒性研究不足。理解对抗样本在任务间的迁移机制对于评估CLIP的泛化极限和安全风险至关重要。

Method: 提出MT-AdvCLIP框架，引入任务感知特征聚合损失，生成具有增强跨任务泛化能力的扰动，强化细粒度任务模型对共享CLIP骨干网络的攻击效果。

Result: 在多个公开数据集上的实验表明，MT-AdvCLIP显著提高了对抗迁移成功率（多任务平均攻击成功率提升超过39%），且不增加扰动预算。

Conclusion: 本研究揭示了多任务CLIP模型中对抗样本的迁移机制，为多任务鲁棒性评估和对抗样本设计提供了新见解。

Abstract: As a general-purpose vision-language pretraining model, CLIP demonstrates
strong generalization ability in image-text alignment tasks and has been widely
adopted in downstream applications such as image classification and image-text
retrieval. However, it struggles with fine-grained tasks such as object
detection and semantic segmentation. While many variants aim to improve CLIP on
these tasks, its robustness to adversarial perturbations remains underexplored.
Understanding how adversarial examples transfer across tasks is key to
assessing CLIP's generalization limits and security risks. In this work, we
conduct a systematic empirical analysis of the cross-task transfer behavior of
CLIP-based models on image-text retrieval, object detection, and semantic
segmentation under adversarial perturbations. We find that adversarial examples
generated from fine-grained tasks (e.g., object detection and semantic
segmentation) often exhibit stronger transfer potential than those from
coarse-grained tasks, enabling more effective attacks against the original CLIP
model. Motivated by this observation, we propose a novel framework, Multi-Task
Adversarial CLIP (MT-AdvCLIP), which introduces a task-aware feature
aggregation loss and generates perturbations with enhanced cross-task
generalization capability. This design strengthens the attack effectiveness of
fine-grained task models on the shared CLIP backbone. Experimental results on
multiple public datasets show that MT-AdvCLIP significantly improves the
adversarial transfer success rate (The average attack success rate across
multiple tasks is improved by over 39%.) against various CLIP-derived models,
without increasing the perturbation budget. This study reveals the transfer
mechanism of adversarial examples in multi-task CLIP models, offering new
insights into multi-task robustness evaluation and adversarial example design.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于掩码自回归模型的训练免费文本引导图像修复方法Token Painter，通过双流编码器信息融合和自适应解码器注意力增强，在保持背景一致性的同时更好地对齐文本提示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在文本引导图像修复中难以同时保证文本细节对齐和背景一致性，掩码自回归模型虽然支持局部可控性但直接应用会忽略文本提示或与背景不协调。

Method: 使用掩码自回归模型，引入双流编码器信息融合在频域融合文本和背景信息生成引导token，以及自适应解码器注意力增强来提升文本对齐和视觉质量。

Result: 在几乎所有指标上都优于现有最先进方法，提供更优的视觉结果。

Conclusion: Token Painter方法无需训练即可实现高质量的文本引导图像修复，在文本对齐和背景一致性方面表现出色。

Abstract: Text-guided image inpainting aims to inpaint masked image regions based on a
textual prompt while preserving the background. Although diffusion-based
methods have become dominant, their property of modeling the entire image in
latent space makes it challenging for the results to align well with prompt
details and maintain a consistent background. To address these issues, we
explore Mask AutoRegressive (MAR) models for this task. MAR naturally supports
image inpainting by generating latent tokens corresponding to mask regions,
enabling better local controllability without altering the background. However,
directly applying MAR to this task makes the inpainting content either ignore
the prompts or be disharmonious with the background context. Through analysis
of the attention maps from the inpainting images, we identify the impact of
background tokens on text tokens during the MAR generation, and leverage this
to design \textbf{Token Painter}, a training-free text-guided image inpainting
method based on MAR. Our approach introduces two key components: (1)
Dual-Stream Encoder Information Fusion (DEIF), which fuses the semantic and
context information from text and background in frequency domain to produce
novel guidance tokens, allowing MAR to generate text-faithful inpainting
content while keeping harmonious with background context. (2) Adaptive Decoder
Attention Score Enhancing (ADAE), which adaptively enhances attention scores on
guidance tokens and inpainting tokens to further enhance the alignment of
prompt details and the content visual quality. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our training-free method outperforms prior state-of-the-art
methods across almost all metrics and delivers superior visual results. Codes
will be released.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新方法来理解深度视觉网络中的概念表示，通过识别编码方向和解码方向对来打开深度网络的黑箱。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度视觉网络将概念表示为潜在空间中的方向，但现有的矩阵分解、自编码器或字典学习方法依赖于特征重建，需要新的视角来理解这些概念嵌入。

Method: 通过方向性聚类识别解码方向，通过概率视角下的信号向量估计编码方向，并利用网络权重通过不确定性区域对齐技术揭示影响预测的可解释方向。

Result: 在合成数据上能恢复真实方向对；在真实数据上解码方向映射到单语义可解释概念且优于无监督基线；信号向量能忠实估计编码方向。

Conclusion: 该方法能够理解全局模型行为、解释个体预测，并通过干预产生反事实或纠正错误，为模型理解、调试和改进提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Empirical evidence shows that deep vision networks represent concepts as
directions in latent space, vectors we call concept embeddings. Each concept
has a latent factor-a scalar-indicating its presence in an input patch. For a
given patch, multiple latent factors are encoded into a compact representation
by linearly combining concept embeddings, with the factors as coefficients.
Since these embeddings enable such encoding, we call them encoding directions.
A latent factor can be recovered via the inner product with a filter, a vector
we call a decoding direction. These encoding-decoding direction pairs are not
directly accessible, but recovering them helps open the black box of deep
networks, enabling understanding, debugging, and improving models. Decoder
directions attribute meaning to latent codes, while encoding directions assess
concept influence on predictions, with both enabling model correction by
unlearning irrelevant concepts. Unlike prior matrix decomposition, autoencoder,
or dictionary learning methods that rely on feature reconstruction, we propose
a new perspective: decoding directions are identified via directional
clustering of activations, and encoding directions are estimated with signal
vectors under a probabilistic view. We further leverage network weights through
a novel technique, Uncertainty Region Alignment, which reveals interpretable
directions affecting predictions. Our analysis shows that (a) on synthetic
data, our method recovers ground-truth direction pairs; (b) on real data,
decoding directions map to monosemantic, interpretable concepts and outperform
unsupervised baselines; and (c) signal vectors faithfully estimate encoding
directions, validated via activation maximization. Finally, we demonstrate
applications in understanding global model behavior, explaining individual
predictions, and intervening to produce counterfactuals or correct errors.

Conclusion: SAR-KnowLIP的大规模多模态数据、可迁移模型架构和全面实验基准将显著推进SAR多模态基线模型的发展。

Abstract: Cross-modal artificial intelligence has garnered widespread attention in
recent years, achieving significant progress in the study of natural images.
However, existing methods are mostly designed for RGB imagery, leaving a
significant gap in modeling synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery. SAR, with
its all-day, all-weather imaging capabilities, plays an irreplaceable role in
remote sensing scene understanding. To address this gap, this paper proposes
SAR-KnowLIP, the first universal SAR multimodal foundational model, along with
reusable data and evaluation baselines. Specifically: (1) This work introduces
the critical yet long-overlooked attribute of geographic information into
remote sensing research, constructing SAR-GEOVL-1M (the first large-scale SAR
dataset with complete geographic projection properties), covering multiple
satellite platforms, 120,000 images, and 135 cities. (2) Aligned structured
text is generated through a hierarchical cognitive chain-of-thought (HCoT),
providing more than one million multi-dimensional semantic annotations of
landforms, regional functions, target attributes, and spatial relationships.
(3) We design a Self-Consistent Iterative Optimization mechanism that
continuously enhances cross-modal alignment through a self-supervised closed
loop of contrastive, matching, and reconstruction learning on a transferable
multimodal encoder. (4) A unified evaluation benchmark is established across 11
representative downstream vision and vision-language tasks, with comparisons
against 14 leading foundation models, where SAR-KnowLIP demonstrates leading
performance, particularly in object counting and land-cover classification. We
expect that SAR-KnowLIP's large-scale multimodal data, transferable model
architecture, and comprehensive experimental benchmark will significantly
advance the development of SAR multimodal baseline models.

TL;DR: AutoPrune是一种训练免费、即插即用的视觉令牌剪枝框架，通过量化视觉和文本令牌之间的互信息来适应不同样本和任务的复杂性，在LLaVA-1.5-7B上剪枝89%视觉令牌，减少76.8%推理FLOPs的同时保持96.7%的原始准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型中的视觉令牌存在冗余，但传统剪枝方法采用固定的层特定剪枝策略，无法根据输入样本和任务的复杂性动态调整剪枝策略，与模型整体推理轨迹不匹配。

Method: AutoPrune通过量化视觉和文本令牌之间的互信息，将其投影到预算约束的逻辑保留曲线上，每个逻辑曲线对应不同任务的具体复杂性，确保满足预定义的计算约束。

Result: 在LLaVA-1.5-7B上，AutoPrune剪枝89%视觉令牌，减少76.8%推理FLOPs，同时保持96.7%的原始准确率，比近期工作PDrop提升9.1%。

Conclusion: AutoPrune能够根据样本和任务复杂性自适应调整剪枝策略，在显著减少计算成本的同时保持模型性能，证明了其有效性。

Abstract: The established redundancy in visual tokens within large vision-language
models allows pruning to effectively reduce their substantial computational
demands. Previous methods typically employ heuristic layer-specific pruning
strategies where, although the number of tokens removed may differ across
decoder layers, the overall pruning schedule is fixed and applied uniformly to
all input samples and tasks, failing to align token elimination with the
model's holistic reasoning trajectory. Cognitive science indicates that human
visual processing often begins with broad exploration to accumulate evidence
before narrowing focus as the target becomes distinct. Our experiments reveal
an analogous pattern in these models. This observation suggests that neither a
fixed pruning schedule nor a heuristic layer-wise strategy can optimally
accommodate the diverse complexities inherent in different inputs. To overcome
this limitation, we introduce Complexity-Adaptive Pruning (AutoPrune), a
training-free, plug-and-play framework that tailors pruning policies to varying
sample and task complexities. Specifically, AutoPrune quantifies the mutual
information between visual and textual tokens, then projects this signal to a
budget-constrained logistic retention curve. Each such logistic curve, defined
by its unique shape, corresponds to the specific complexity of different tasks
and can guarantee adherence to predefined computational constraints. We
evaluate AutoPrune on standard vision-language tasks and on
Vision-Language-Action models for autonomous driving. Notably, when applied to
LLaVA-1.5-7B, our method prunes 89% of visual tokens and reduces inference
FLOPs by 76.8% while retaining 96.7% of the original accuracy averaged over all
tasks. This corresponds to a 9.1% improvement over the recent work PDrop,
demonstrating the effectiveness. Code is available at

Conclusion: 提出的无需学习方法为单视图3D分割提供了有效解决方案，特别适用于多视图一致性方法不实用或不可行的汽车损伤检测场景。

Abstract: Automatic car damage detection has been a topic of significant interest for
the auto insurance industry as it promises faster, accurate, and cost-effective
damage assessments. However, few works have gone beyond 2D image analysis to
leverage 3D reconstruction methods, which have the potential to provide a more
comprehensive and geometrically accurate representation of the damage.
Moreover, recent methods employing 3D representations for novel view synthesis,
particularly 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS), have demonstrated the ability to
generate accurate and coherent 3D reconstructions from a limited number of
views. In this work we introduce an automatic car damage detection pipeline
that performs 3D damage segmentation by up-lifting 2D masks. Additionally, we
propose a simple yet effective learning-free approach for single-view 3D-GS
segmentation. Specifically, Gaussians are projected onto the image plane using
camera parameters obtained via Structure from Motion (SfM). They are then
filtered through an algorithm that utilizes Z-buffering along with a normal
distribution model of depth and opacities. Through experiments we found that
this method is particularly effective for challenging scenarios like car damage
detection, where target objects (e.g., scratches, small dents) may only be
clearly visible in a single view, making multi-view consistency approaches
impractical or impossible. The code is publicly available at:

Abstract: Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) and Referring Expression Generation
(REG) are fundamental tasks in multimodal understanding, supporting precise
object localization through natural language. However, existing REC and REG
datasets rely heavily on manual annotation, which is labor-intensive and
difficult to scale. In this paper, we propose ColLab, a collaborative spatial
progressive data engine that enables fully automated REC and REG data
generation without human supervision. Specifically, our method introduces a
Collaborative Multimodal Model Interaction (CMMI) strategy, which leverages the
semantic understanding of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and large
language models (LLMs) to generate descriptions. Furthermore, we design a
module termed Spatial Progressive Augmentation (SPA) to enhance spatial
expressiveness among duplicate instances. Experiments demonstrate that ColLab
significantly accelerates the annotation process of REC and REG while improving
the quality and discriminability of the generated expressions. In addition to
the core methodological contribution, our framework was partially adopted in
the data generation pipeline of the ICCV 2025 MARS2 Challenge on Multimodal
Reasoning, enriching the dataset with diverse and challenging samples that
better reflect real-world reasoning demands.

Conclusion: RLIR是首个专门设计用于增强视频世界模型动作跟随能力的后训练方法

Abstract: World models simulate dynamic environments, enabling agents to interact with
diverse input modalities. Although recent advances have improved the visual
quality and temporal consistency of video world models, their ability of
accurately modeling human-specified actions remains under-explored.
Reinforcement learning presents a promising approach for directly improving the
suboptimal action-following capability of pre-trained models, assuming that an
appropriate reward function can be defined. However, transferring reinforcement
learning post-training methods to world model is impractical due to the
prohibitive cost of large-scale preference annotations and the infeasibility of
constructing rule-based video verifiers. To address this gap, we propose
Reinforcement Learning with Inverse Rewards (RLIR), a post-training framework
that derives verifiable reward signals by recovering input actions from
generated videos using an Inverse Dynamics Model. By mapping high-dimensional
video modality to a low-dimensional action space, RLIR provides an objective
and verifiable reward for optimization via Group Relative Policy Optimization.
Experiments across autoregressive and diffusion paradigms demonstrate 5-10%
gains in action-following, up to 10% improvements in visual quality, and higher
human preference scores, establishing RLIR as the first post-training method
specifically designed to enhance action-following in video world models.

Adaptive Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with Cohen-Daubechies-Feauveau

(96.58% accuracy; AUC 0.987), Swin-T (96.41%; 0.986), ViT-B/16 (95.72%; 0.983),
and ConvNeXt-T (96.94%; 0.987). Our method outperforms the best of these by
+1.23 points in accuracy and +0.0042 in AUC, while remaining computationally
efficient (28.7 ms per image; 1,125 MB peak VRAM). Robustness is further
supported by cross-dataset testing on TCIA (accuracy 95.82%) and transfer to an
ISIC skin-lesion subset (n = 28 unique images, augmented to 2,048; accuracy
97.31%). Explainability analyses (Grad-CAM, SHAP, LIME) highlight clinically
relevant regions. Altogether, the wavelet-chaos-CNN pipeline delivers
state-of-the-art thyroid ultrasound classification with strong generalization
and practical runtime characteristics suitable for clinical integration.

*Kargi Chauhan,Leilani H. Gilpin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出VFSI方法，通过在扩散采样过程中使用基于能量的引导来强制执行物理约束，无需重新训练模型，显著提高了交通模拟的物理有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的扩散模型生成逼真的交通模拟，但系统性地违反物理约束，50%的生成轨迹违反基本物理定律，如车辆碰撞、驶离道路等，表明当前模型将物理有效性视为涌现属性而非架构要求。

Method: 提出Validity-First Spatial Intelligence (VFSI)，在扩散采样过程中通过基于能量的引导强制执行约束，将碰撞避免和运动学约束作为能量函数，引导去噪过程生成物理有效的轨迹。

Result: 在Waymo开放运动数据集的200个城市场景中，VFSI将碰撞率降低67%（从24.6%到8.1%），整体有效性提高87%（从50.3%到94.2%），同时改进了真实感指标（ADE从1.34m提升到1.21m）。

Conclusion: 模型无关的方法表明，在推理过程中显式强制执行约束对于物理有效的交通模拟既是必要的也是充分的。

Abstract: Modern diffusion models generate realistic traffic simulations but
systematically violate physical constraints. In a large-scale evaluation of
SceneDiffuser++, a state-of-the-art traffic simulator, we find that 50% of
generated trajectories violate basic physical laws - vehicles collide, drive
off roads, and spawn inside buildings. This reveals a fundamental limitation:
current models treat physical validity as an emergent property rather than an
architectural requirement. We propose Validity-First Spatial Intelligence
(VFSI), which enforces constraints through energy-based guidance during
diffusion sampling, without model retraining. By incorporating collision
avoidance and kinematic constraints as energy functions, we guide the denoising
process toward physically valid trajectories. Across 200 urban scenarios from
the Waymo Open Motion Dataset, VFSI reduces collision rates by 67% (24.6% to
8.1%) and improves overall validity by 87% (50.3% to 94.2%), while
simultaneously improving realism metrics (ADE: 1.34m to 1.21m). Our
model-agnostic approach demonstrates that explicit constraint enforcement
during inference is both necessary and sufficient for physically valid traffic
simulation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出OASIS，一种高效的一步扩散模型，通过注意力专业化路由和渐进式训练策略解决视频超分辨率中的冗余问题，在性能和推理速度上均优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在视频超分辨率中表现良好，但直接应用会导致计算冗余，因为低质量视频已包含大量内容信息，增加了计算负担和学习难度。

Method: OASIS采用注意力专业化路由，根据内在行为将注意力头分配给不同模式，减少冗余同时保留预训练知识；并提出渐进式训练策略，从时间一致退化开始，逐步转向不一致设置。

Result: 在合成和真实世界数据集上达到最先进性能，相比SeedVR2等一步扩散基线模型提供6.2倍的推理加速。

Conclusion: OASIS通过注意力专业化有效解决了扩散模型在视频超分辨率中的冗余问题，在保持高性能的同时显著提升了推理效率。

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently shown promising results for video
super-resolution (VSR). However, directly adapting generative diffusion models
to VSR can result in redundancy, since low-quality videos already preserve
substantial content information. Such redundancy leads to increased
computational overhead and learning burden, as the model performs superfluous
operations and must learn to filter out irrelevant information. To address this
problem, we propose OASIS, an efficient $\textbf{o}$ne-step diffusion model
with $\textbf{a}$ttention $\textbf{s}$pecialization for real-world
v$\textbf{i}$deo $\textbf{s}$uper-resolution. OASIS incorporates an attention
specialization routing that assigns attention heads to different patterns
according to their intrinsic behaviors. This routing mitigates redundancy while
effectively preserving pretrained knowledge, allowing diffusion models to
better adapt to VSR and achieve stronger performance. Moreover, we propose a
simple yet effective progressive training strategy, which starts with
temporally consistent degradations and then shifts to inconsistent settings.
This strategy facilitates learning under complex degradations. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that OASIS achieves state-of-the-art performance on
both synthetic and real-world datasets. OASIS also provides superior inference
speed, offering a $\textbf{6.2$\times$}$ speedup over one-step diffusion
baselines such as SeedVR2. The code will be available at

TL;DR: RPG360是一种无需训练的360度单目深度估计方法，利用透视基础模型和图优化来处理全景图像，解决了深度尺度不一致性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 360度图像在各领域的应用日益增多，但获取大规模标注数据集用于360度深度估计仍然是一个重大挑战。

Method: 将360度图像转换为六面立方体映射表示，使用透视基础模型估计深度和表面法线，并通过基于图的优化技术进行深度尺度对齐。

Result: 在Matterport3D、Stanford2D3D和360Loc等多个数据集上表现出色，并在特征匹配和运动结构恢复等下游任务中验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法利用基础模型的零样本鲁棒性，实现了跨数据集的优越性能，为360度深度估计提供了一种有效的训练免费解决方案。

Abstract: The increasing use of 360 images across various domains has emphasized the
need for robust depth estimation techniques tailored for omnidirectional
images. However, obtaining large-scale labeled datasets for 360 depth
estimation remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose RPG360, a
training-free robust 360 monocular depth estimation method that leverages
perspective foundation models and graph optimization. Our approach converts 360
images into six-face cubemap representations, where a perspective foundation
model is employed to estimate depth and surface normals. To address depth scale
inconsistencies across different faces of the cubemap, we introduce a novel
depth scale alignment technique using graph-based optimization, which
parameterizes the predicted depth and normal maps while incorporating an
additional per-face scale parameter. This optimization ensures depth scale
consistency across the six-face cubemap while preserving 3D structural
integrity. Furthermore, as foundation models exhibit inherent robustness in
zero-shot settings, our method achieves superior performance across diverse
datasets, including Matterport3D, Stanford2D3D, and 360Loc. We also demonstrate
the versatility of our depth estimation approach by validating its benefits in
downstream tasks such as feature matching 3.2 ~ 5.4% and Structure from Motion
0.2 ~ 9.7% in AUC@5.

Conclusion: TREAT-Net有潜力成为非侵入性工具，为医疗资源有限人群提供及时准确的ACS治疗预测。

Abstract: Coronary angiography remains the gold standard for diagnosing Acute Coronary
Syndrome (ACS). However, its resource-intensive and invasive nature can expose
patients to procedural risks and diagnostic delays, leading to postponed
treatment initiation. In this work, we introduce TREAT-Net, a multimodal deep
learning framework for ACS treatment prediction that leverages non-invasive
modalities, including echocardiography videos and structured clinical records.
TREAT-Net integrates tabular-guided cross-attention to enhance video
interpretation, along with a late fusion mechanism to align predictions across
modalities. Trained on a dataset of over 9000 ACS cases, the model outperforms
unimodal and non-fused baselines, achieving a balanced accuracy of 67.6% and an
AUROC of 71.1%. Cross-modality agreement analysis demonstrates 88.6% accuracy
for intervention prediction. These findings highlight the potential of
TREAT-Net as a non-invasive tool for timely and accurate patient triage,
particularly in underserved populations with limited access to coronary
angiography.

Motivation: 现有方法缺乏通过文本对表情进行细粒度、直观控制的能力，难以从单张图像生成高质量的3D头部化身。

Method: 提出新颖的条件调节方案，将图像中的身份特征与文本的语义嵌入融合；引入创新的感知表情损失函数，使用预训练的表情分类器来正则化生成过程。

Result: 大量实验表明SIE3D在可控性和真实感方面显著提升，在身份保持和表情保真度上优于竞争方法，且仅需单个消费级GPU。

Conclusion: SIE3D框架成功实现了从单张图像和文本生成高质量、表情可控的3D头部化身，在控制精度和生成质量方面表现出色。

Abstract: Generating high-fidelity 3D head avatars from a single image is challenging,
as current methods lack fine-grained, intuitive control over expressions via
text. This paper proposes SIE3D, a framework that generates expressive 3D
avatars from a single image and descriptive text. SIE3D fuses identity features
from the image with semantic embedding from text through a novel conditioning
scheme, enabling detailed control. To ensure generated expressions accurately
match the text, it introduces an innovative perceptual expression loss
function. This loss uses a pre-trained expression classifier to regularize the
generation process, guaranteeing expression accuracy. Extensive experiments
show SIE3D significantly improves controllability and realism, outperforming
competitive methods in identity preservation and expression fidelity on a
single consumer-grade GPU. Project page:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FrameMind是一个端到端的视频理解框架，通过强化学习训练模型动态请求视觉信息，使用Frame-Interleaved Chain-of-Thought交替进行文本推理和主动视觉感知。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频理解模型采用固定的帧采样策略，无法根据具体问题的推理需求自适应地收集视觉证据，在需要广泛时间覆盖或精细空间细节的任务上表现欠佳。

Method: 提出FrameMind框架，使用FiCOT在多个轮次中交替进行文本推理和主动视觉感知；开发DRFS动态分辨率帧采样和DRFS-GRPO策略优化算法，无需帧级标注即可从结果奖励中学习。

Result: 在MLVU和VideoMME等挑战性基准测试中，该方法显著优于现有模型，推进了灵活高效视频理解的技术水平。

Conclusion: FrameMind通过动态视觉信息请求机制，实现了更灵活和高效的视频理解，解决了传统固定采样策略的局限性。

Abstract: Current video understanding models rely on fixed frame sampling strategies,
processing predetermined visual inputs regardless of the specific reasoning
requirements of each question. This static approach limits their ability to
adaptively gather visual evidence, leading to suboptimal performance on tasks
that require either broad temporal coverage or fine-grained spatial detail. In
this paper, we introduce FrameMind, an end-to-end framework trained with
reinforcement learning that enables models to dynamically request visual
information during reasoning through Frame-Interleaved Chain-of-Thought
(FiCOT). Unlike traditional approaches, FrameMind operates in multiple turns
where the model alternates between textual reasoning and active visual
perception, using tools to extract targeted frames or video clips based on
identified knowledge gaps. To train effective dynamic sampling policies, we
propose Dynamic Resolution Frame Sampling (DRFS), which exposes models to
diverse temporal-spatial trade-offs during learning, and DRFS-GRPO, a
group-relative policy optimization algorithm that learns from outcome-based
rewards without requiring frame-level annotations. Extensive experiments on
challenging benchmarks like MLVU and VideoMME demonstrate that our method
significantly outperforms existing models, advancing the state of the art in
flexible and efficient video understanding.

TL;DR: 提出了首个针对高光谱图像的广义类别发现框架，通过原型子空间建模来更好地捕捉类别结构，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GCD方法主要针对RGB图像，其假设和建模策略不适用于高维且具有复杂光谱结构的高光谱图像。

Method: 使用一组基向量为每个类别建模子空间表示，通过基向量正交性和重构约束来指导学习，提高高维特征空间中的表达能力和区分度。

Result: 在真实高光谱图像数据集上的实验结果表明，该方法显著优于最先进的GCD方法。

Conclusion: 为高光谱环境中的广义类别发现建立了坚实基础，证明了子空间建模在高维数据中的有效性。

Abstract: Generalized category discovery~(GCD) seeks to jointly identify both known and
novel categories in unlabeled data. While prior works have mainly focused on
RGB images, their assumptions and modeling strategies do not generalize well to
hyperspectral images~(HSI), which are inherently high-dimensional and exhibit
complex spectral structures. In this paper, we propose the first GCD framework
tailored for HSI, introducing a prototype subspace modeling model to better
capture class structure. Instead of learning a single prototype vector for each
category as in existing methods such as SimGCD, we model each category using a
set of basis vectors, forming a subspace representation that enables greater
expressiveness and discrimination in a high-dimensional feature space. To guide
the learning of such bases, we enforce two key constraints: (1) a basis
orthogonality constraint that promotes inter-class separability, and (2) a
reconstruction constraint that ensures each prototype basis can effectively
reconstruct its corresponding class samples. Experimental results on real-world
HSI demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art GCD
methods, establishing a strong foundation for generalized category discovery in
hyperspectral settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种结合大气散射物理先验和行人关系拓扑建模的深度学习模型，用于雾霾天气下的行人轨迹预测，显著提升了在低能见度条件下的预测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决雾霾天气条件下行人轨迹预测中物理信息退化和行人交互建模无效的问题。

Method: 构建可微分大气散射模型解耦雾霾浓度与光照退化；设计自适应扫描状态空间模型进行特征提取；开发异构图注意力网络建模行人多粒度交互关系。

Result: 在密集雾霾场景（能见度<30m）中，相比SOTA模型，minADE/minFDE指标分别降低37.2%和41.5%，推理速度提升78%。

Conclusion: 为恶劣环境下智能交通系统的可靠感知提供了新的建模范式。

Abstract: To address the issues of physical information degradation and ineffective
pedestrian interaction modeling in pedestrian trajectory prediction under hazy
weather conditions, we propose a deep learning model that combines physical
priors of atmospheric scattering with topological modeling of pedestrian
relationships. Specifically, we first construct a differentiable atmospheric
scattering model that decouples haze concentration from light degradation
through a network with physical parameter estimation, enabling the learning of
haze-mitigated feature representations. Second, we design an adaptive scanning
state space model for feature extraction. Our adaptive Mamba variant achieves a
78% inference speed increase over native Mamba while preserving long-range
dependency modeling.
  Finally, to efficiently model pedestrian relationships, we develop a
heterogeneous graph attention network, using graph matrices to model
multi-granularity interactions between pedestrians and groups, combined with a
spatio-temporal fusion module to capture the collaborative evolution patterns
of pedestrian movements. Furthermore, we constructed a new pedestrian
trajectory prediction dataset based on ETH/UCY to evaluate the effectiveness of
the proposed method. Experiments show that our method reduces the minADE /
minFDE metrics by 37.2% and 41.5%, respectively, compared to the SOTA models in
dense haze scenarios (visibility < 30m), providing a new modeling paradigm for
reliable perception in intelligent transportation systems in adverse
environments.

TL;DR: 该论文提出直接在原始Bayer格式上训练图像重建网络，相比传统的后ISP sRGB图像训练，能获得更好的重建效果，特别是在雨滴去除任务中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图像重建网络在ISP处理后的sRGB图像上训练，但ISP处理会不可逆地混合颜色、裁剪动态范围并模糊细节。作者希望通过直接在原始Bayer数据上学习来避免这些信息损失。

Method: 使用雨滴退化问题作为案例研究，评估后ISP和Bayer重建流程；构建Raw-Rain基准数据集（首个包含12位Bayer和位深度匹配sRGB的真实雨景数据集）；引入信息守恒评分（ICS）作为颜色不变性指标。

Result: 在测试集上，原始域模型将sRGB结果提升了+0.99 dB PSNR和+1.2% ICS，同时运行速度更快且仅需一半的GFLOPs。

Conclusion: 结果支持低层视觉任务采用"ISP最后"范式，为端到端可学习相机管线打开了大门。

Abstract: Image reconstruction from corrupted images is crucial across many domains.
Most reconstruction networks are trained on post-ISP sRGB images, even though
the image-signal-processing pipeline irreversibly mixes colors, clips dynamic
range, and blurs fine detail. This paper uses the rain degradation problem as a
use case to show that these losses are avoidable, and demonstrates that
learning directly on raw Bayer mosaics yields superior reconstructions. To
substantiate the claim, we (i) evaluate post-ISP and Bayer reconstruction
pipelines, (ii) curate Raw-Rain, the first public benchmark of real rainy
scenes captured in both 12-bit Bayer and bit-depth-matched sRGB, and (iii)
introduce Information Conservation Score (ICS), a color-invariant metric that
aligns more closely with human opinion than PSNR or SSIM. On the test split,
our raw-domain model improves sRGB results by up to +0.99 dB PSNR and +1.2%
ICS, while running faster with half of the GFLOPs. The results advocate an
ISP-last paradigm for low-level vision and open the door to end-to-end
learnable camera pipelines.

Method: 统一端到端框架，联合优化超像素分割和子空间聚类。核心是反馈机制：基于展开ADMM的自表示网络提供模型驱动信号，指导可微分超像素模块。超像素网络为每个超像素学习独特的紧凑度参数。

Result: 在基准HSI数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法相比最先进的聚类方法始终获得更优的准确率。

Conclusion: 联合优化框架能够产生聚类感知的分区，同时保持光谱和空间结构，实现更灵活和自适应的分割。

Abstract: Subspace clustering is a powerful unsupervised approach for hyperspectral
image (HSI) analysis, but its high computational and memory costs limit
scalability. Superpixel segmentation can improve efficiency by reducing the
number of data points to process. However, existing superpixel-based methods
usually perform segmentation independently of the clustering task, often
producing partitions that do not align with the subsequent clustering
objective. To address this, we propose a unified end-to-end framework that
jointly optimizes superpixel segmentation and subspace clustering. Its core is
a feedback mechanism: a self-representation network based on unfolded
Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) provides a model-driven
signal to guide a differentiable superpixel module. This joint optimization
yields clustering-aware partitions that preserve both spectral and spatial
structure. Furthermore, our superpixel network learns a unique compactness
parameter for each superpixel, enabling more flexible and adaptive
segmentation. Extensive experiments on benchmark HSI datasets demonstrate that
our method consistently achieves superior accuracy compared with
state-of-the-art clustering approaches.

Motivation: 预训练视觉模型的计算和存储成本限制了实际部署。传统剪枝方法需要任务特定数据，但当下游任务未知时存在挑战。本文研究数据如何影响预训练视觉模型的剪枝。

Method: 在预训练模型上进行初始化剪枝，研究不同任务数据对剪枝效果的影响，分析剪枝后模型在未见任务上的零样本性能以及微调后的性能恢复。

Result: 令人惊讶的是，在一个任务上剪枝的模型在未见任务上仍保持零样本性能。微调这些剪枝模型不仅能提高原始任务性能，还能恢复未见任务的性能。

Conclusion: 这种现象归因于在大规模数据集上进行广泛预训练所诱导的有利损失景观，使得数据无关剪枝成为可能。

Abstract: The widespread availability of pre-trained vision models has enabled numerous
deep learning applications through their transferable representations. However,
their computational and storage costs often limit practical deployment.
Pruning-at-Initialization has emerged as a promising approach to compress
models before training, enabling efficient task-specific adaptation. While
conventional wisdom suggests that effective pruning requires task-specific
data, this creates a challenge when downstream tasks are unknown in advance. In
this paper, we investigate how data influences the pruning of pre-trained
vision models. Surprisingly, pruning on one task retains the model's zero-shot
performance also on unseen tasks. Furthermore, fine-tuning these pruned models
not only improves performance on original seen tasks but can recover held-out
tasks' performance. We attribute this phenomenon to the favorable loss
landscapes induced by extensive pre-training on large-scale datasets.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在多模态基准测试中表现良好，但在结构化推理和精确接地方面仍存在局限。现有研究表明添加简单视觉结构能提高准确性，但其内部机制尚不清楚。

Method: 通过表示分析和因果干预，研究了外部线索诱导的潜在标识符（Grounding IDs）如何在不同模态间绑定对象到指定分区。

Result: 发现Grounding IDs在嵌入空间中形成稳健的跨分区对齐，减小了图像和文本之间的模态差距，并通过因果干预证实这些标识符介导了对象与符号线索之间的绑定。

Conclusion: Grounding IDs是解释外部线索如何增强多模态绑定的关键符号机制，既提供了可解释性，又带来了鲁棒性的实际改进。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) show strong performance across
multimodal benchmarks but remain limited in structured reasoning and precise
grounding. Recent work has demonstrated that adding simple visual structures,
such as partitions and annotations, improves accuracy, yet the internal
mechanisms underlying these gains remain unclear. We investigate this
phenomenon and propose the concept of Grounding IDs, latent identifiers induced
by external cues that bind objects to their designated partitions across
modalities. Through representation analysis, we find that these identifiers
emerge as robust within-partition alignment in embedding space and reduce the
modality gap between image and text. Causal interventions further confirm that
these identifiers mediate binding between objects and symbolic cues. We show
that Grounding IDs strengthen attention between related components, which in
turn improves cross-modal grounding and reduces hallucinations. Taken together,
our results identify Grounding IDs as a key symbolic mechanism explaining how
external cues enhance multimodal binding, offering both interpretability and
practical improvements in robustness.

Motivation: 质疑帧是否是视频自回归的合适预测单元，挑战传统逐帧生成方法的假设。

Method: 开发支持多种预测单元的统一框架，特别采用时空立方体作为预测单元，让自回归模型能同时在空间和时间维度上操作。

Result: 基于立方体的预测在质量、速度和时序一致性方面表现最优，超越现有SOTA方法，推理更快，并能扩展到分钟级序列。

Conclusion: 这项工作鼓励重新思考视频和其他时空域中的序列分解方式，打破了逐帧生成的限制。

Abstract: Autoregressive models for video generation typically operate frame-by-frame,
extending next-token prediction from language to video's temporal dimension. We
question that unlike word as token is universally agreed in language if frame
is a appropriate prediction unit? To address this, we present VideoAR, a
unified framework that supports a spectrum of prediction units including full
frames, key-detail frames, multiscale refinements, and spatiotemporal cubes.
Among these designs, we find model video generation using
\textit{spatiotemporal} cubes as prediction units, which allows autoregressive
models to operate across both spatial and temporal dimensions simultaneously.
This approach eliminates the assumption that frames are the natural atomic
units for video autoregression. We evaluate VideoAR across diverse prediction
strategies, finding that cube-based prediction consistently delivers superior
quality, speed, and temporal coherence. By removing the frame-by-frame
constraint, our video generator surpasses state-of-the-art baselines on VBench
while achieving faster inference and enabling seamless scaling to minute-long
sequences. We hope this work will motivate rethinking sequence decomposition in
video and other spatiotemporal domains.

framework for multi-modal two-person motion generation. DualFlow conditions 3D
motion synthesis on diverse inputs, including text, music, and prior motion
sequences. Leveraging rectified flow, it achieves deterministic straight-line
sampling paths between noise and data, reducing inference time and mitigating
error accumulation common in diffusion-based models. To enhance semantic
grounding, DualFlow employs a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) module that
retrieves motion exemplars using music features and LLM-based text
decompositions of spatial relations, body movements, and rhythmic patterns. We
use contrastive objective that further strengthens alignment with conditioning
signals and introduce synchronization loss that improves inter-person
coordination. Extensive evaluations across text-to-motion, music-to-motion, and
multi-modal interactive benchmarks show consistent gains in motion quality,
responsiveness, and efficiency. DualFlow produces temporally coherent and
rhythmically synchronized motions, setting state-of-the-art in multi-modal
human motion generation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前RVOS方法面临MLLMs先验知识利用不足、长视频计算内存成本高、复杂时序动态处理不足等挑战。

Method: 提出SVAC模型，包含Anchor-Based Spatio-Temporal Compression (ASTC)模块压缩视觉token，Clip-Specific Allocation (CSA)策略处理跨视频片段的动态对象行为。

Result: 在多个RVOS基准测试中达到最先进性能，并具有竞争力的效率。

Conclusion: SVAC通过扩展输入帧和分割token，结合有效的压缩策略，显著提升了RVOS的性能和效率。

Abstract: Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment target objects in
video sequences based on natural language descriptions. While recent advances
in Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have improved RVOS performance
through enhanced text-video understanding, several challenges remain, including
insufficient exploitation of MLLMs' prior knowledge, prohibitive computational
and memory costs for long-duration videos, and inadequate handling of complex
temporal dynamics. In this work, we propose SVAC, a unified model that improves
RVOS by scaling up input frames and segmentation tokens to enhance
video-language interaction and segmentation precision. To address the resulting
computational challenges, SVAC incorporates the Anchor-Based Spatio-Temporal
Compression (ASTC) module to compress visual tokens while preserving essential
spatio-temporal structure. Moreover, the Clip-Specific Allocation (CSA)
strategy is introduced to better handle dynamic object behaviors across video
clips. Experimental results demonstrate that SVAC achieves state-of-the-art
performance on multiple RVOS benchmarks with competitive efficiency. Our code

This paper introduces GANji, a lightweight framework for benchmarking
foundational AI image generation techniques using a dataset of 10,314 Japanese
Kanji characters. It systematically compares the performance of a Variational
Autoencoder (VAE), a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), and a Denoising
Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM). The results demonstrate that while the

Motivation: 解决自然语言查询在图形用户界面中的定位问题，该任务需要理解多样化的UI元素并准确预测空间坐标。

Method: 提出GMS框架，包含五个阶段，采用分层搜索和跨模态通信。通用VLM作为'扫描器'识别潜在区域，微调后的定位模型作为'定位器'输出精确坐标。

Result: 在ScreenSpot-Pro数据集上，扫描器和定位器单独使用时准确率仅为2.0%和3.7%，但GMS框架整合后达到35.7%的准确率，提升10倍，显著优于其他基线方法。

Conclusion: GMS框架通过协同利用通用和专用模型的优势，在GUI定位任务中表现出强大的鲁棒性和泛化潜力。

Abstract: Grounding natural language queries in graphical user interfaces (GUIs)
presents a challenging task that requires models to comprehend diverse UI
elements across various applications and systems, while also accurately
predicting the spatial coordinates for the intended operation. To tackle this
problem, we propose GMS: Generalist Scanner Meets Specialist Locator, a
synergistic coarse-to-fine framework that effectively improves GUI grounding
performance. GMS leverages the complementary strengths of general
vision-language models (VLMs) and small, task-specific GUI grounding models by
assigning them distinct roles within the framework. Specifically, the general
VLM acts as a 'Scanner' to identify potential regions of interest, while the
fine-tuned grounding model serves as a 'Locator' that outputs precise
coordinates within these regions. This design is inspired by how humans perform
GUI grounding, where the eyes scan the interface and the brain focuses on
interpretation and localization. Our whole framework consists of five stages
and incorporates hierarchical search with cross-modal communication to achieve
promising prediction results. Experimental results on the ScreenSpot-Pro
dataset show that while the 'Scanner' and 'Locator' models achieve only $2.0\%$
and $3.7\%$ accuracy respectively when used independently, their integration
within GMS framework yields an overall accuracy of $35.7\%$, representing a $10
\times$ improvement. Additionally, GMS significantly outperforms other strong
baselines under various settings, demonstrating its robustness and potential
for general-purpose GUI grounding.

Abstract: Retinal disease diagnosis is critical in preventing vision loss and reducing
socioeconomic burdens. Globally, over 2.2 billion people are affected by some
form of vision impairment, resulting in annual productivity losses estimated at
$411 billion. Traditional manual grading of retinal fundus images by
ophthalmologists is time-consuming and subjective. In contrast, deep learning
has revolutionized medical diagnostics by automating retinal image analysis and
achieving expert-level performance. In this study, we present EYE-DEX, an
automated framework for classifying 10 retinal conditions using the large-scale
Retinal Disease Dataset comprising 21,577 eye fundus images. We benchmark three
pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models--VGG16, VGG19, and
ResNet50--with our finetuned VGG16 achieving a state-of-the-art global
benchmark test accuracy of 92.36%. To enhance transparency and explainability,
we integrate the Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM)
technique to generate visual explanations highlighting disease-specific
regions, thereby fostering clinician trust and reliability in AI-assisted
diagnostics.

Motivation: 揭示AI系统在面部审美预测中的种族偏见问题，即使使用看似平衡的数据源，AI仍会引入偏见，影响审美标准的形成。

Method: 使用SCUT-FBP5500和MEBeauty数据集训练模型，通过严格的统计验证（Kruskal-Wallis H检验、事后Dunn分析）和跨数据集验证，在平衡的FairFace数据集上评估预测差异。

Result: 两个模型在种族群体间均表现出显著预测差异（p < 0.001），仅有4.8-9.5%的组间比较满足分布均等标准，算法放大了社会审美偏见。

Conclusion: 当前AI审美预测方法存在不足，提出了详细的缓解策略，强调需要开发更公平的美容技术。

Abstract: Bias can be introduced to AI systems even from seemingly balanced sources,
and AI facial beauty prediction is subject to ethnicity-based bias. This work
sounds warnings about AI's role in shaping aesthetic norms while providing
potential pathways toward equitable beauty technologies through comparative
analysis of models trained on SCUT-FBP5500 and MEBeauty datasets. Employing
rigorous statistical validation (Kruskal-Wallis H-tests, post hoc Dunn
analyses). It is demonstrated that both models exhibit significant prediction
disparities across ethnic groups $(p < 0.001)$, even when evaluated on the
balanced FairFace dataset. Cross-dataset validation shows algorithmic
amplification of societal beauty biases rather than mitigation based on
prediction and error parity. The findings underscore the inadequacy of current
AI beauty prediction approaches, with only 4.8-9.5\% of inter-group comparisons
satisfying distributional parity criteria. Mitigation strategies are proposed
and discussed in detail.

Conclusion: FastVSR通过高效压缩和稳定训练策略，在视频超分辨率任务中实现了显著的推理效率提升。

Abstract: Diffusion models have significant advantages in the field of real-world video
super-resolution and have demonstrated strong performance in past research. In
recent diffusion-based video super-resolution (VSR) models, the number of
sampling steps has been reduced to just one, yet there remains significant room
for further optimization in inference efficiency. In this paper, we propose
FastVSR, which achieves substantial reductions in computational cost by
implementing a high compression VAE (spatial compression ratio of 16, denoted
as f16). We design the structure of the f16 VAE and introduce a stable training
framework. We employ pixel shuffle and channel replication to achieve
additional upsampling. Furthermore, we propose a lower-bound-guided training
strategy, which introduces a simpler training objective as a lower bound for
the VAE's performance. It makes the training process more stable and easier to
converge. Experimental results show that FastVSR achieves speedups of 111.9
times compared to multi-step models and 3.92 times compared to existing
one-step models. We will release code and models at

Motivation: 青少年特发性脊柱侧弯(AIS)需要冠状面和矢状面的形态评估，但现有无辐射方法主要关注冠状面，矢状面评估仍缺乏可靠的无辐射解决方案。

Conclusion: 该研究为矢状面脊柱评估提供了有前景的无辐射解决方案，推进了AIS的全面评估。

Abstract: Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis (AIS) is a complex three-dimensional spinal
deformity, and accurate morphological assessment requires evaluating both
coronal and sagittal alignment. While previous research has made significant
progress in developing radiation-free methods for coronal plane assessment,
reliable and accurate evaluation of sagittal alignment without ionizing
radiation remains largely underexplored. To address this gap, we propose
LatXGen, a novel generative framework that synthesizes realistic lateral spinal
radiographs from posterior Red-Green-Blue and Depth (RGBD) images of unclothed
backs. This enables accurate, radiation-free estimation of sagittal spinal
alignment. LatXGen tackles two core challenges: (1) inferring sagittal spinal
morphology changes from a lateral perspective based on posteroanterior surface
geometry, and (2) performing cross-modality translation from RGBD input to the
radiographic domain. The framework adopts a dual-stage architecture that
progressively estimates lateral spinal structure and synthesizes corresponding
radiographs. To enhance anatomical consistency, we introduce an attention-based
Fast Fourier Convolution (FFC) module for integrating anatomical features from
RGBD images and 3D landmarks, and a Spatial Deformation Network (SDN) to model
morphological variations in the lateral view. Additionally, we construct the
first large-scale paired dataset for this task, comprising 3,264 RGBD and
lateral radiograph pairs. Experimental results demonstrate that LatXGen
produces anatomically accurate radiographs and outperforms existing GAN-based
methods in both visual fidelity and quantitative metrics. This study offers a
promising, radiation-free solution for sagittal spine assessment and advances
comprehensive AIS evaluation.

Abstract: Medical image analysis faces significant challenges in data sharing due to
privacy regulations and complex institutional protocols. Dataset distillation
offers a solution to address these challenges by synthesizing compact datasets
that capture essential information from real, large medical datasets.
Trajectory matching has emerged as a promising methodology for dataset
distillation; however, existing methods primarily focus on terminal states,
overlooking crucial information in intermediate optimization states. We address
this limitation by proposing a shape-wise potential that captures the geometric
structure of parameter trajectories, and an easy-to-complex matching strategy
that progressively addresses parameters based on their complexity. Experiments
on medical image classification tasks demonstrate that our method improves
distillation performance while preserving privacy and maintaining model
accuracy comparable to training on the original datasets. Our code is available

Conclusion: DECERN方法通过结合不确定性和多样性度量，能够有效感知细粒度图像间的差异性并评估样本价值，在细粒度图像分类的主动学习中表现出色。

Abstract: Active learning (AL) aims to build high-quality labeled datasets by
iteratively selecting the most informative samples from an unlabeled pool under
limited annotation budgets. However, in fine-grained image classification,
assessing this informativeness is especially challenging due to subtle
inter-class differences. In this paper, we introduce a novel method, combining
discrepancy-confusion uncertainty and calibration diversity for active
fine-grained image classification (DECERN), to effectively perceive the
distinctiveness between fine-grained images and evaluate the sample value.
DECERN introduces a multifaceted informativeness measure that combines
discrepancy-confusion uncertainty and calibration diversity. The
discrepancy-confusion uncertainty quantifies the category directionality and
structural stability of fine-grained unlabeled data during local feature
fusion. Subsequently, uncertainty-weighted clustering is performed to diversify
the uncertainty samples. Then we calibrate the diversity to maximize the global
diversity of the selected sample while maintaining its local
representativeness. Extensive experiments conducted on 7 fine-grained image
datasets across 26 distinct experimental settings demonstrate that our method
achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: 该方法能够根据变化的放射组学特征生成各种肿瘤类型，在治疗规划中具有潜在应用价值。

Abstract: Due to privacy concerns, obtaining large datasets is challenging in medical
image analysis, especially with 3D modalities like Computed Tomography (CT) and
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Existing generative models, developed to
address this issue, often face limitations in output diversity and thus cannot
accurately represent 3D medical images. We propose a tumor-generation model
that utilizes radiomics features as generative conditions. Radiomics features
are high-dimensional handcrafted semantic features that are biologically
well-grounded and thus are good candidates for conditioning. Our model employs
a GAN-based model to generate tumor masks and a diffusion-based approach to
generate tumor texture conditioned on radiomics features. Our method allows the
user to generate tumor images according to user-specified radiomics features
such as size, shape, and texture at an arbitrary location. This enables the
physicians to easily visualize tumor images to better understand tumors
according to changing radiomics features. Our approach allows for the removal,
manipulation, and repositioning of tumors, generating various tumor types in
different scenarios. The model has been tested on tumors in four different
organs (kidney, lung, breast, and brain) across CT and MRI. The synthesized
images are shown to effectively aid in training for downstream tasks and their
authenticity was also evaluated through expert evaluations. Our method has
potential usage in treatment planning with diverse synthesized tumors.

Abstract: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is a common therapy option before the main
surgery for breast cancer. Response to NAC is monitored using follow-up dynamic
contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI). Accurate prediction of
NAC response helps with treatment planning. Here, we adopt maximum intensity
projection images from DCE-MRI to generate post-treatment images (i.e., 3 or 12
weeks after NAC) from pre-treatment images leveraging the emerging diffusion
model. We introduce prompt tuning to account for the known clinical factors
affecting response to NAC. Our model performed better than other generative
models in image quality metrics. Our model was better at generating images that
reflected changes in tumor size according to pCR compared to other models.
Ablation study confirmed the design choices of our method. Our study has the
potential to help with precision medicine.

TL;DR: 提出了TaSe框架，通过解构语言表示来改进视觉语言模型对复杂查询的感知能力，在OmniLabel基准上实现了24%的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在处理包含描述性属性和关系从句的复杂查询时表现有限，主要原因是文本编码器无法有效分离目标对象与其描述属性和关系。

Method: 提出TaSe框架：1) 构建分层合成字幕数据集；2) Talk in Pieces模块将文本嵌入解构为对象、属性和关系三个组件；3) See in Whole模块将解构的组件聚合成分层结构化嵌入。

Result: 在OmniLabel基准测试中实现了24%的性能提升，证明了语言组合性的重要性。

Conclusion: 通过引入层次化语言结构归纳偏置，TaSe框架能够产生细粒度的多模态表示，显著提升了基于语言的对象检测性能。

Abstract: While vision-language models (VLMs) have made significant progress in
multimodal perception (e.g., open-vocabulary object detection) with simple
language queries, state-of-the-art VLMs still show limited ability to perceive
complex queries involving descriptive attributes and relational clauses. Our
in-depth analysis shows that these limitations mainly stem from text encoders
in VLMs. Such text encoders behave like bags-of-words and fail to separate
target objects from their descriptive attributes and relations in complex
queries, resulting in frequent false positives. To address this, we propose
restructuring linguistic representations according to the hierarchical
relations within sentences for language-based object detection. A key insight
is the necessity of disentangling textual tokens into core components-objects,
attributes, and relations ("talk in pieces")-and subsequently aggregating them
into hierarchically structured sentence-level representations ("see in whole").
Building on this principle, we introduce the TaSe framework with three main
contributions: (1) a hierarchical synthetic captioning dataset spanning three
tiers from category names to descriptive sentences; (2) Talk in Pieces, the
three-component disentanglement module guided by a novel disentanglement loss
function, transforms text embeddings into subspace compositions; and (3) See in
Whole, which learns to aggregate disentangled components into hierarchically
structured embeddings with the guide of proposed hierarchical objectives. The
proposed TaSe framework strengthens the inductive bias of hierarchical
linguistic structures, resulting in fine-grained multimodal representations for
language-based object detection. Experimental results under the OmniLabel
benchmark show a 24% performance improvement, demonstrating the importance of
linguistic compositionality.

T2-FLAIR images are input into a pretrained autoencoder to acquire an efficient
latent space representation. A rectified flow diffusion model is then trained
in this latent space representation. The T1C-RFlow model was trained on a
curated dataset comprised of the BraTS 2024 glioma (GLI; 1480 patients),
meningioma (MEN; 1141 patients), and metastases (MET; 1475 patients) datasets.
Selected patients were split into train (N=2860), validation (N=612), and test
(N=614) sets. Results: Both qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate
that the T1C-RFlow model outperforms benchmark 3D models (pix2pix, DDPM,
Diffusion Transformers (DiT-3D)) trained in the same latent space. T1C-RFlow
achieved the following metrics - GLI: NMSE 0.044 +/- 0.047, SSIM 0.935 +/-
0.025; MEN: NMSE 0.046 +/- 0.029, SSIM 0.937 +/- 0.021; MET: NMSE 0.098 +/-
0.088, SSIM 0.905 +/- 0.082. T1C-RFlow had the best tumor reconstruction
performance and significantly faster denoising times (6.9 s/volume, 200 steps)
than conventional DDPM models in both latent space (37.7s, 1000 steps) and
patch-based in image space (4.3 hr/volume). Significance: Our proposed method
generates synthetic T1C images that closely resemble ground truth T1C in much
less time than previous diffusion models. Further development may permit a
practical method for contrast-agent-free MRI for brain tumors.

Abstract: Unified video modeling that combines generation and understanding

TL;DR: BALR-SAM是一个边界感知的低秩自适应框架，通过三个定制组件增强SAM在医学图像分割中的性能，仅需更新1.8%参数即可超越多个SOTA方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视觉基础模型（如SAM）在医学图像分割中因缺乏领域特定适应而表现不佳的问题，同时满足临床实践中对高效微调、低资源需求和强性能的要求。

Method: 结合三个组件：(1) 使用深度可分离卷积和多尺度融合的互补细节增强网络捕获边界敏感特征；(2) 在ViT块中集成低秩适配器优化医学上下文特征表示和注意力；(3) 在掩码解码器中采用低秩张量注意力机制，减少75%内存使用并提升推理速度。

Conclusion: BALR-SAM框架有效解决了SAM在医学图像分割中的领域适应问题，通过边界感知和低秩自适应实现了高效、高性能的医学图像分割。

Abstract: Vision foundation models like the Segment Anything Model (SAM), pretrained on
large-scale natural image datasets, often struggle in medical image
segmentation due to a lack of domain-specific adaptation. In clinical practice,
fine-tuning such models efficiently for medical downstream tasks with minimal
resource demands, while maintaining strong performance, is challenging. To
address these issues, we propose BALR-SAM, a boundary-aware low-rank adaptation
framework that enhances SAM for medical imaging. It combines three tailored
components: (1) a Complementary Detail Enhancement Network (CDEN) using
depthwise separable convolutions and multi-scale fusion to capture
boundary-sensitive features essential for accurate segmentation; (2) low-rank
adapters integrated into SAM's Vision Transformer blocks to optimize feature
representation and attention for medical contexts, while simultaneously
significantly reducing the parameter space; and (3) a low-rank tensor attention
mechanism in the mask decoder, cutting memory usage by 75% and boosting
inference speed. Experiments on standard medical segmentation datasets show
that BALR-SAM, without requiring prompts, outperforms several state-of-the-art
(SOTA) methods, including fully fine-tuned MedSAM, while updating just 1.8%
(11.7M) of its parameters.

Motivation: 现有方法要么重建速度慢，要么无法生成新时间表示。需要解决从非标定稀疏视角视频实时重建动态3D人体的挑战。

Conclusion: Forge4D能够高效重建时间对齐的4D人体表示，支持新视角和新时间合成，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Instant reconstruction of dynamic 3D humans from uncalibrated sparse-view
videos is critical for numerous downstream applications. Existing methods,
however, are either limited by the slow reconstruction speeds or incapable of
generating novel-time representations. To address these challenges, we propose
Forge4D, a feed-forward 4D human reconstruction and interpolation model that
efficiently reconstructs temporally aligned representations from uncalibrated
sparse-view videos, enabling both novel view and novel time synthesis. Our
model simplifies the 4D reconstruction and interpolation problem as a joint
task of streaming 3D Gaussian reconstruction and dense motion prediction. For
the task of streaming 3D Gaussian reconstruction, we first reconstruct static
3D Gaussians from uncalibrated sparse-view images and then introduce learnable
state tokens to enforce temporal consistency in a memory-friendly manner by
interactively updating shared information across different timestamps. For
novel time synthesis, we design a novel motion prediction module to predict
dense motions for each 3D Gaussian between two adjacent frames, coupled with an
occlusion-aware Gaussian fusion process to interpolate 3D Gaussians at
arbitrary timestamps. To overcome the lack of the ground truth for dense motion
supervision, we formulate dense motion prediction as a dense point matching
task and introduce a self-supervised retargeting loss to optimize this module.
An additional occlusion-aware optical flow loss is introduced to ensure motion
consistency with plausible human movement, providing stronger regularization.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on both
in-domain and out-of-domain datasets. Project page and code at:

Conclusion: AVF-MAE++通过可扩展的预训练和增强的跨模态相关性建模，为情感视频面部分析提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Affective video facial analysis (AVFA) has emerged as a key research field
for building emotion-aware intelligent systems, yet this field continues to
suffer from limited data availability. In recent years, the self-supervised
learning (SSL) technique of Masked Autoencoders (MAE) has gained momentum, with
growing adaptations in its audio-visual contexts. While scaling has proven
essential for breakthroughs in general multi-modal learning domains, its
specific impact on AVFA remains largely unexplored. Another core challenge in
this field is capturing both intra- and inter-modal correlations through
scalable audio-visual representations. To tackle these issues, we propose
AVF-MAE++, a family of audio-visual MAE models designed to efficiently
investigate the scaling properties in AVFA while enhancing cross-modal
correlation modeling. Our framework introduces a novel dual masking strategy
across audio and visual modalities and strengthens modality encoders with a
more holistic design to better support scalable pre-training. Additionally, we
present the Iterative Audio-Visual Correlation Learning Module, which improves
correlation learning within the SSL paradigm, bridging the limitations of
previous methods. To support smooth adaptation and reduce overfitting risks, we
further introduce a progressive semantic injection strategy, organizing the
model training into three structured stages. Extensive experiments conducted on
17 datasets, covering three major AVFA tasks, demonstrate that AVF-MAE++
achieves consistent state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks.
Comprehensive ablation studies further highlight the importance of each
proposed component and provide deeper insights into the design choices driving
these improvements. Our code and models have been publicly released at Github.

Conclusion: EVLF-FM是早期具有可解释性和推理能力的多疾病VLM模型，可促进基础模型在真实世界临床部署中的采用和信任。

Abstract: Despite the promise of foundation models in medical AI, current systems
remain limited - they are modality-specific and lack transparent reasoning
processes, hindering clinical adoption. To address this gap, we present
EVLF-FM, a multimodal vision-language foundation model (VLM) designed to unify
broad diagnostic capability with fine-grain explainability. The development and
testing of EVLF-FM encompassed over 1.3 million total samples from 23 global
datasets across eleven imaging modalities related to six clinical specialties:
dermatology, hepatology, ophthalmology, pathology, pulmonology, and radiology.
External validation employed 8,884 independent test samples from 10 additional
datasets across five imaging modalities. Technically, EVLF-FM is developed to
assist with multiple disease diagnosis and visual question answering with
pixel-level visual grounding and reasoning capabilities. In internal validation
for disease diagnostics, EVLF-FM achieved the highest average accuracy (0.858)
and F1-score (0.797), outperforming leading generalist and specialist models.
In medical visual grounding, EVLF-FM also achieved stellar performance across
nine modalities with average mIOU of 0.743 and Acc@0.5 of 0.837. External
validations further confirmed strong zero-shot and few-shot performance, with
competitive F1-scores despite a smaller model size. Through a hybrid training
strategy combining supervised and visual reinforcement fine-tuning, EVLF-FM not
only achieves state-of-the-art accuracy but also exhibits step-by-step
reasoning, aligning outputs with visual evidence. EVLF-FM is an early
multi-disease VLM model with explainability and reasoning capabilities that
could advance adoption of and trust in foundation models for real-world
clinical deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将推理局限于语言空间，视觉信息仅作为静态前提条件，存在根本性限制

Method: 使用视觉编码器将图像投影到与语言模型共享的联合语义空间中的视觉标记，训练语言模型生成能重建关键视觉标记的潜在状态，实现潜在视觉推理

Result: 在MMVP上达到71.67%的准确率，相比Qwen2.5-VL的66.67%有显著提升

Conclusion: LVR大幅改善了细粒度视觉理解和感知能力，通过结合GRPO算法进行强化学习，进一步平衡了潜在推理和文本生成

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved notable gains in
various tasks by incorporating Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in language
spaces. Recent work extends this direction by leveraging external tools for
visual editing, thereby enhancing the visual signal along the reasoning
trajectories. Nevertheless, these approaches remain fundamentally constrained:
reasoning is still confined to the language space, with visual information
treated as static preconditions. We introduce Latent Visual Reasoning (LVR), a
new paradigm that enables autoregressive reasoning directly in the visual
embedding space. A visual encoder first projects images into visual tokens
within a joint semantic space shared with the language model. The language
model is then trained to generate latent states that reconstruct key visual
tokens critical for answering the query, constituting the process of latent
visual reasoning. By interleaving LVR with standard text generation, our model
achieves substantial gains on perception-intensive visual question answering
tasks. In addition, we adapt the GRPO algorithm to conduct reinforcement
learning on latent reasoning, further balancing LVR and textual generation. We
show that LVR substantially improves fine-grained visual understanding and
perception, achieving 71.67% on MMVP compared to 66.67% with Qwen2.5-VL. Code
base and model weights will be released later.

Conclusion: CoTAM通过自适应特征保护和多级重建策略，有效解决了MLLM专用图像压缩问题，在比特率和任务性能间取得良好平衡。

Abstract: The increasing deployment of powerful Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs), typically hosted on cloud platforms, urgently requires effective
compression techniques to efficiently transmit signal inputs (e.g., images,
videos) from edge devices with minimal bandwidth usage. However, conventional
image codecs are optimized for fidelity to serve the Human Visual System (HVS)
and ill-suited for MLLMs, in which diverse downstream tasks are jointly
considered. In this paper, we first systematically analyze the impact of
compression artifacts on several mainstream MLLMs. We find that: Compression
distortion unevenly impacts different-level image features, leading to varying
effects on MLLMs' downstream tasks depending on their feature-level reliance.
Motivated by this discovery, we propose an image Codec TAilored to MLLMs
(CoTAM) designed to adaptively protect multi-level features and suit different
demands of downstream tasks. The encoder leverages CLIP's shallow-layer
attention to generate an importance map for bit allocation, preserving critical
semantic regions. Concurrently, the decoder integrates a lightweight adapter
with a multi-level loss function to ensure the faithful reconstruction both of
low-level details and high-level semantic context for robust synthesis of
cross-level features. Extensive experiments validate that our method achieves
up to 35.99\% bitrate saving while maintaining the same performance on the MLLM
tasks, outperforming previous SOTA neural codecs.

Conclusion: S²NN在边缘计算应用中具有广阔前景，通过亚比特权重表示实现了更好的压缩和加速效果。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer an energy-efficient paradigm for machine
intelligence, but their continued scaling poses challenges for resource-limited
deployment. Despite recent advances in binary SNNs, the storage and
computational demands remain substantial for large-scale networks. To further
explore the compression and acceleration potential of SNNs, we propose Sub-bit
Spiking Neural Networks (S$^2$NNs) that represent weights with less than one
bit. Specifically, we first establish an S$^2$NN baseline by leveraging the
clustering patterns of kernels in well-trained binary SNNs. This baseline is
highly efficient but suffers from \textit{outlier-induced codeword selection
bias} during training. To mitigate this issue, we propose an
\textit{outlier-aware sub-bit weight quantization} (OS-Quant) method, which
optimizes codeword selection by identifying and adaptively scaling outliers.
Furthermore, we propose a \textit{membrane potential-based feature
distillation} (MPFD) method, improving the performance of highly compressed
S$^2$NN via more precise guidance from a teacher model. Extensive results on
vision and non-vision tasks reveal that S$^2$NN outperforms existing quantized
SNNs in both performance and efficiency, making it promising for edge computing
applications.

In this work, we introduce a cycle training framework to fine-tune diffusion

quality as measured by FID and SSIM. The results suggest that the cycle
strategy used in CDM can be an effective method for refining diffusion-based

Motivation: 现实世界中的点云常受传感器限制、环境噪声和预处理误差影响，导致密度失真、噪声污染和几何变形，现有基于直接点匹配或表面特征提取的方法对这些干扰敏感，配准精度下降。

Method: 提出骨架驱动的鲁棒配准框架，将骨架结构整合到配准过程中，结合从损坏点云对齐和骨架对齐获得的变换来实现最优配准，并设计了分布距离损失函数来强制源和目标骨架之间的一致性。

Result: 在多种损坏数据集上的实验评估表明，SRRF在各种损坏场景下（包括密度失真、噪声污染和几何变形）始终优于最先进的配准方法。

Conclusion: SRRF在处理损坏点云方面具有鲁棒性，使其成为现实场景中3D感知任务的潜在方法。

Abstract: Point cloud registration is fundamental in 3D vision applications, including
autonomous driving, robotics, and medical imaging, where precise alignment of
multiple point clouds is essential for accurate environment reconstruction.
However, real-world point clouds are often affected by sensor limitations,
environmental noise, and preprocessing errors, making registration challenging
due to density distortions, noise contamination, and geometric deformations.
Existing registration methods rely on direct point matching or surface feature
extraction, which are highly susceptible to these corruptions and lead to
reduced alignment accuracy. To address these challenges, a skeleton-based
robust registration framework is presented, which introduces a
corruption-resilient skeletal representation to improve registration robustness
and accuracy. The framework integrates skeletal structures into the
registration process and combines the transformations obtained from both the
corrupted point cloud alignment and its skeleton alignment to achieve optimal
registration. In addition, a distribution distance loss function is designed to
enforce the consistency between the source and target skeletons, which
significantly improves the registration performance. This framework ensures
that the alignment considers both the original local geometric features and the
global stability of the skeleton structure, resulting in robust and accurate
registration results. Experimental evaluations on diverse corrupted datasets
demonstrate that SRRF consistently outperforms state-of-the-art registration
methods across various corruption scenarios, including density distortions,
noise contamination, and geometric deformations. The results confirm the
robustness of SRRF in handling corrupted point clouds, making it a potential
approach for 3D perception tasks in real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: CEGC为具有挑战性条件下的部分点云配准提供了一个可解释且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Partial point cloud registration is essential for autonomous perception and
3D scene understanding, yet it remains challenging owing to structural
ambiguity, partial visibility, and noise. We address these issues by proposing
Confidence Estimation under Global Context (CEGC), a unified, confidence-driven
framework for robust partial 3D registration. CEGC enables accurate alignment
in complex scenes by jointly modeling overlap confidence and correspondence
reliability within a shared global context. Specifically, the hybrid overlap
confidence estimation module integrates semantic descriptors and geometric
similarity to detect overlapping regions and suppress outliers early. The
context-aware matching strategy smitigates ambiguity by employing global
attention to assign soft confidence scores to correspondences, improving
robustness. These scores guide a differentiable weighted singular value
decomposition solver to compute precise transformations. This tightly coupled
pipeline adaptively down-weights uncertain regions and emphasizes contextually
reliable matches. Experiments on ModelNet40, ScanObjectNN, and 7Scenes 3D
vision datasets demonstrate that CEGC outperforms state-of-the-art methods in
accuracy, robustness, and generalization. Overall, CEGC offers an interpretable
and scalable solution to partial point cloud registration under challenging

Conclusion: ASIA框架通过少量图像标注实现了高质量的3D分割，克服了传统方法的局限性，在分割精度和实用性方面都有显著提升。

Abstract: We introduce ASIA (Adaptive 3D Segmentation using few Image Annotations), a
novel framework that enables segmentation of possibly non-semantic and
non-text-describable "parts" in 3D. Our segmentation is controllable through a
few user-annotated in-the-wild images, which are easier to collect than
multi-view images, less demanding to annotate than 3D models, and more precise
than potentially ambiguous text descriptions. Our method leverages the rich
priors of text-to-image diffusion models, such as Stable Diffusion (SD), to
transfer segmentations from image space to 3D, even when the annotated and
target objects differ significantly in geometry or structure. During training,
we optimize a text token for each segment and fine-tune our model with a novel
cross-view part correspondence loss. At inference, we segment multi-view
renderings of the 3D mesh, fuse the labels in UV-space via voting, refine them
with our novel Noise Optimization technique, and finally map the UV-labels back
onto the mesh. ASIA provides a practical and generalizable solution for both
semantic and non-semantic 3D segmentation tasks, outperforming existing methods
by a noticeable margin in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

*Hanqi Chen,Zhongyin Zhao,Ye Chen,Zhujin Liang,Bingbing Ni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SVGThinker是一个基于推理的文本到SVG生成框架，通过链式思维和渐进式可视化过程，解决了现有方法的泛化能力弱和指令遵循差的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决文本到SVG生成中的两个关键问题：弱泛化能力和对输入指令的遵循性差，同时支持完整的SVG图元集合。

Method: 使用多模态模型对图像和代码进行标注，构建渐进式更新过程，通过监督微调训练LLM并暴露中间推理链，提高鲁棒性。

Result: 相比最先进的基线方法，SVGThinker生成更稳定、可编辑且质量更高的SVG，同时保持矢量图形的结构优势。

Conclusion: 该方法为设计、内容创作和自动化图形生成开辟了新方向，支持精确和分层编辑。

Abstract: Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) is a code-based representation for 2D visuals.
Leveraging recent advances in large language models (LLMs), we study
text-to-SVG generation and address two persistent gaps: weak generalization and
poor adherence to input instructions. We present SVGThinker, a reasoning-driven
framework that aligns the production of SVG code with the visualization process
and supports the full set of SVG primitives. Our pipeline first renders each
primitive in sequence and uses a multimodal model to annotate the image and
code; we then build stepwise updates that mirror the incremental addition of
primitives. On this data, we train an LLM with supervised fine-tuning that
exposes its chain-of-thought as intermediate reasoning, improving robustness
and reducing errors and hallucinations. Experiments against state-of-the-art
baselines show that SVGThinker produces more stable, editable, and
higher-quality SVGs while preserving the structural advantages of vector
graphics. Unlike image-based methods, our outputs enable precise and
hierarchical editing, opening new directions for design, content creation, and
automated graphics generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FrameThinker是一个用于长视频推理的新框架，通过迭代式视频内容查询和两阶段训练策略，显著提升了LVLMs在长视频理解任务中的效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LVLMs在长视频推理中存在均匀帧采样和静态文本推理的局限性，导致效率低下且难以处理视觉密集型视频任务。

Method: 提出FrameThinker框架，采用两阶段训练策略：首先使用监督微调(SFT)建立基础动作能力，然后通过强化学习(RL)优化策略决策，并深入探索奖励函数设计。

Result: 在多个推理基准测试中，FrameThinker平均提升10.4%，7B模型在LongVideo-Reason上达到76.1%准确率，仅使用20.6帧，比竞争对手少20倍帧数。

Conclusion: FrameThinker通过迭代式视频推理和优化训练策略，在长视频理解任务中实现了前所未有的效率和效果，为LVLMs的长视频应用开辟了新途径。

Abstract: While Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved substantial progress
in video understanding, their application to long video reasoning is hindered
by uniform frame sampling and static textual reasoning, which are inefficient
and struggle to handle visually intensive video tasks. To overcome these
challenges, in this paper, we introduce the concept of thinking with long
videos and propose a novel framework FrameThinker. Within this framework, LVLMs
are able to iteratively interrogate video content. Developing such video
reasoning capabilities in LVLMs presents notable challenges, particularly in
adapting the model to new video actions (e.g. select frame), and designing
reward functions to guide LVLMs to adopt the newly introduced action. To solve
these challenges, we propose a two-phase training strategy, first employing
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to instill fundamental action capabilities,
followed by Reinforcement Learning (RL) to optimize a strategic decision-making
policy.Notably, in this RL phase, we conduct an in-depth and comprehensive
exploration of the reward design for each action and format reward. Extensive
experiments on reasoning benchmarks like Video-Holmes, LongVideo-Reason, and
long-video understanding benchmarks such as LongVideoBench, MLVU, VideoMME, and
LVBench, demonstrate that FrameThinker achieves a significant average
improvement of +10.4% over baselines while drastically reducing the number of
processed frames. Most notably, our 7B model, FrameThinker establishes a new
state-of-the-art on LongVideo-Reason, achieving 76.1% accuracy using an average
of only 20.6 frames. This not only outperforms the competitive LongVILA-R1
(72.0%) but does so with over 20x fewer frames (vs. 512), demonstrating
unparalleled efficiency and effectiveness.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OMeGa是一个端到端框架，联合优化显式三角网格和2D高斯泼溅，通过网格约束和单目法线监督提高室内无纹理区域的几何重建精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在无纹理室内区域存在几何不准确问题，且网格提取与优化分离，无法利用网格几何指导泼溅优化。

Method: 提出灵活的绑定策略，将高斯泼溅的空间属性表达在网格框架中，保留纹理属性在泼溅上；集成网格约束和单目法线监督；采用启发式迭代网格细化策略。

Result: 在挑战性室内重建基准测试中达到最先进性能，将Chamfer-L1距离相比2DGS基线减少47.3%，同时保持竞争力的新视角渲染质量。

Conclusion: OMeGa有效解决了先前室内无纹理重建中的局限性，证明了联合优化网格和高斯泼溅的有效性。

Abstract: Neural rendering with Gaussian splatting has advanced novel view synthesis,
and most methods reconstruct surfaces via post-hoc mesh extraction. However,
existing methods suffer from two limitations: (i) inaccurate geometry in
texture-less indoor regions, and (ii) the decoupling of mesh extraction from
optimization, thereby missing the opportunity to leverage mesh geometry to
guide splat optimization. In this paper, we present OMeGa, an end-to-end
framework that jointly optimizes an explicit triangle mesh and 2D Gaussian
splats via a flexible binding strategy, where spatial attributes of Gaussian
Splats are expressed in the mesh frame and texture attributes are retained on
splats. To further improve reconstruction accuracy, we integrate mesh
constraints and monocular normal supervision into the optimization, thereby
regularizing geometry learning. In addition, we propose a heuristic, iterative
mesh-refinement strategy that splits high-error faces and prunes unreliable
ones to further improve the detail and accuracy of the reconstructed mesh.
OMeGa achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging indoor
reconstruction benchmarks, reducing Chamfer-$L_1$ by 47.3\% over the 2DGS
baseline while maintaining competitive novel-view rendering quality. The
experimental results demonstrate that OMeGa effectively addresses prior
limitations in indoor texture-less reconstruction.

Motivation: 冷冻电镜断层扫描中的亚断层图分析面临标注稀缺、噪声严重和泛化能力差等挑战，需要开发能够有效处理这些问题的通用基础模型。

Method: 1) CryoEngine合成数据生成器产生904k亚断层图；2) 自适应相位标记化增强的视觉Transformer(APT-ViT)提高几何和语义变化的鲁棒性；3) 噪声鲁棒对比学习策略在严重噪声条件下稳定表示学习。

Conclusion: 该工作推进了冷冻电镜断层扫描中可扩展和鲁棒的亚断层图分析，为领域提供了首个基础模型解决方案。

Abstract: Cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) enables in situ visualization of
macromolecular structures, where subtomogram analysis tasks such as
classification, alignment, and averaging are critical for structural
determination. However, effective analysis is hindered by scarce annotations,
severe noise, and poor generalization. To address these challenges, we take the
first step towards foundation models for cryo-ET subtomograms. First, we
introduce CryoEngine, a large-scale synthetic data generator that produces over
904k subtomograms from 452 particle classes for pretraining. Second, we design
an Adaptive Phase Tokenization-enhanced Vision Transformer (APT-ViT), which
incorporates adaptive phase tokenization as an equivariance-enhancing module
that improves robustness to both geometric and semantic variations. Third, we
introduce a Noise-Resilient Contrastive Learning (NRCL) strategy to stabilize
representation learning under severe noise conditions. Evaluations across 24
synthetic and real datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on
all three major subtomogram tasks and strong generalization to unseen datasets,
advancing scalable and robust subtomogram analysis in cryo-ET.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统特征度量方法可能错过复杂的互相关关系，而相关度量方法由于处理4D相关图导致计算成本高昂。

Method: 采用选择性状态空间模型(SSMs)，实现相似性感知的选择性扫描机制，基于Mamba的线性复杂度算法有效细化4D相关图。

Result: 在标准语义对应基准测试中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: MambaMatcher克服了现有方法的局限性，在保持特征图分辨率和感受野的同时，高效建模高维相关性。

Abstract: Establishing semantic correspondences between images is a fundamental yet
challenging task in computer vision. Traditional feature-metric methods enhance
visual features but may miss complex inter-correlation relationships, while
recent correlation-metric approaches are hindered by high computational costs
due to processing 4D correlation maps. We introduce MambaMatcher, a novel
method that overcomes these limitations by efficiently modeling
high-dimensional correlations using selective state-space models (SSMs). By
implementing a similarity-aware selective scan mechanism adapted from Mamba's
linear-complexity algorithm, MambaMatcher refines the 4D correlation map
effectively without compromising feature map resolution or receptive field.
Experiments on standard semantic correspondence benchmarks demonstrate that
MambaMatcher achieves state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: 提出基于三平面的多视角鸡只计数模型TP-MVCC，通过几何投影和三平面融合整合多摄像头特征，构建首个真实养殖环境下的多视角丝羽乌骨鸡数据集，在密集遮挡场景中实现95.1%的精确计数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决智能农业中动物精确计数的难题，特别是在密集场景下由于遮挡和有限相机视角导致的计数困难。

Method: 使用几何投影和三平面融合技术，提取单视角特征并通过空间变换对齐，解码场景级密度图进行精确计数。

Result: TP-MVCC显著优于单视角和传统融合方法，在密集遮挡场景中达到95.1%的准确率，并展现出强大的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法在智能农业中具有实际应用潜力，能够有效解决密集遮挡场景下的动物计数问题。

Abstract: Accurate animal counting is essential for smart farming but remains difficult
in crowded scenes due to occlusions and limited camera views. To address this,
we propose a tri-plane-based multi-view chicken counting model (TP-MVCC), which
leverages geometric projection and tri-plane fusion to integrate features from
multiple cameras onto a unified ground plane. The framework extracts
single-view features, aligns them via spatial transformation, and decodes a
scene-level density map for precise chicken counting. In addition, we construct
the first multi-view dataset of silkie chickens under real farming conditions.
Experiments show that TP-MVCC significantly outperforms single-view and
conventional fusion comparisons, achieving 95.1\% accuracy and strong
robustness in dense, occluded scenarios, demonstrating its practical potential
for intelligent agriculture.

### [242] [Hyperspherical Latents Improve Continuous-Token Autoregressive Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24335)
*Guolin Ke,Hui Xue*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SphereAR通过将AR模型的输入输出约束在固定半径的超球面上，解决了VAE潜在空间中异质方差导致的方差崩溃问题，在图像生成任务中实现了AR模型的新SOTA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归模型在图像生成中表现有潜力，但连续token的AR变体通常落后于潜在扩散和掩码生成模型。核心问题是VAE潜在空间中的异质方差在AR解码过程中被放大，特别是在无分类器引导下会导致方差崩溃。

Method: 提出SphereAR方法，将所有AR输入输出（包括CFG后）约束在固定半径的超球面上，利用超球面VAE。理论分析表明超球面约束移除了尺度分量（方差崩溃的主要原因），从而稳定AR解码。

Result: 在ImageNet生成任务中，SphereAR-H（943M）实现了AR模型的新SOTA，FID达到1.34。更小规模的SphereAR-L（479M）和SphereAR-B（208M）分别达到FID 1.54和1.92，匹配或超越了更大的基线模型。

Conclusion: 这是首次纯下一个token的AR图像生成器（光栅顺序）在可比参数规模下超越了扩散和掩码生成模型。

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models are promising for image generation, yet
continuous-token AR variants often trail latent diffusion and masked-generation
models. The core issue is heterogeneous variance in VAE latents, which is
amplified during AR decoding, especially under classifier-free guidance (CFG),
and can cause variance collapse. We propose SphereAR to address this issue. Its
core design is to constrain all AR inputs and outputs -- including after CFG --
to lie on a fixed-radius hypersphere (constant $\ell_2$ norm), leveraging
hyperspherical VAEs. Our theoretical analysis shows that hyperspherical
constraint removes the scale component (the primary cause of variance
collapse), thereby stabilizing AR decoding. Empirically, on ImageNet
generation, SphereAR-H (943M) sets a new state of the art for AR models,
achieving FID 1.34. Even at smaller scales, SphereAR-L (479M) reaches FID 1.54
and SphereAR-B (208M) reaches 1.92, matching or surpassing much larger
baselines such as MAR-H (943M, 1.55) and VAR-d30 (2B, 1.92). To our knowledge,
this is the first time a pure next-token AR image generator with raster order
surpasses diffusion and masked-generation models at comparable parameter
scales.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种自反思和自我改进的多智能体框架，用于解决农业视觉问答中多图像输入和外部上下文缺失的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有农业视觉问答方法主要针对文本查询或单图像场景，无法处理需要多图像互补视角和生长阶段信息的真实农业场景，且缺乏对外部农业上下文的访问和系统质量控制。

Method: 设计包含四个角色的多智能体框架：检索器（Retriever）收集外部信息，反射器（Reflector）评估充分性并触发重新检索，两个回答器（Answerer）并行生成候选答案以减少偏见，改进器（Improver）通过迭代检查精炼答案并确保多图像信息有效对齐。

Result: 在AgMMU基准测试中，该框架在多图像农业问答任务上取得了有竞争力的性能。

Conclusion: 该自反思和自我改进的多智能体框架能够有效处理农业视觉问答中的多图像输入和上下文缺失问题，展示了在真实农业场景中的实用性。

Abstract: Agricultural visual question answering is essential for providing farmers and
researchers with accurate and timely knowledge. However, many existing
approaches are predominantly developed for evidence-constrained settings such
as text-only queries or single-image cases. This design prevents them from
coping with real-world agricultural scenarios that often require multi-image
inputs with complementary views across spatial scales, and growth stages.
Moreover, limited access to up-to-date external agricultural context makes
these systems struggle to adapt when evidence is incomplete. In addition, rigid
pipelines often lack systematic quality control. To address this gap, we
propose a self-reflective and self-improving multi-agent framework that
integrates four roles, the Retriever, the Reflector, the Answerer, and the
Improver. They collaborate to enable context enrichment, reflective reasoning,
answer drafting, and iterative improvement.
  A Retriever formulates queries and gathers external information, while a
Reflector assesses adequacy and triggers sequential reformulation and renewed
retrieval. Two Answerers draft candidate responses in parallel to reduce bias.
The Improver refines them through iterative checks while ensuring that
information from multiple images is effectively aligned and utilized.
Experiments on the AgMMU benchmark show that our framework achieves competitive
performance on multi-image agricultural QA.

*Yixuan Ren,Hanyu Wang,Hao Chen,Bo He,Abhinav Shrivastava*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NeRV-Diffusion是一种隐式潜在视频扩散模型，通过生成神经网络权重来合成视频。该框架包含两个阶段：基于超网络的标记器将视频编码为神经参数空间，以及隐式扩散变换器对隐式神经表示权重进行去噪。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视频标记器将视频编码为逐帧特征图，而NeRV-Diffusion将视频整体压缩并生成为一个统一的神经网络，避免了去噪器中的时间跨帧注意力，实现高效高质量的视频合成。

Method: 1) 超网络标记器将原始视频从像素空间编码到神经参数空间；2) 隐式扩散变换器对隐式神经表示权重进行去噪；3) 重用瓶颈潜在变量，改进权重分配、上采样连接和输入坐标；4) 引入SNR自适应损失加权和计划采样。

Result: NeRV-Diffusion在UCF-101和Kinetics-600等真实世界视频基准测试中，相比之前的基于INR的模型具有更优的视频生成质量，与最新的非隐式模型性能相当，并实现了平滑的INR权重空间，便于帧间或视频间的无缝插值。

Conclusion: NeRV-Diffusion通过将视频表示为统一的神经网络，实现了高效高质量的视频合成，在生成质量和插值能力方面表现出色，为隐式神经表示在视频生成领域的应用提供了新的思路。

Abstract: We present NeRV-Diffusion, an implicit latent video diffusion model that
synthesizes videos via generating neural network weights. The generated weights
can be rearranged as the parameters of a convolutional neural network, which
forms an implicit neural representation (INR), and decodes into videos with
frame indices as the input. Our framework consists of two stages: 1) A
hypernetworkbased tokenizer that encodes raw videos from pixel space to neural
parameter space, where the bottleneck latent serves as INR weights to decode.
2) An implicit diffusion transformer that denoises on the latent INR weights.
In contrast to traditional video tokenizers that encode videos into frame-wise
feature maps, NeRV-Diffusion compresses and generates a video holistically as a
unified neural network. This enables efficient and high-quality video synthesis
via obviating temporal cross-frame attentions in the denoiser and decoding
video latent with dedicated decoders. To achieve Gaussian-distributed INR
weights with high expressiveness, we reuse the bottleneck latent across all
NeRV layers, as well as reform its weight assignment, upsampling connection and
input coordinates. We also introduce SNR-adaptive loss weighting and scheduled
sampling for effective training of the implicit diffusion model. NeRV-Diffusion
reaches superior video generation quality over previous INR-based models and
comparable performance to most recent state-of-the-art non-implicit models on
real-world video benchmarks including UCF-101 and Kinetics-600. It also brings
a smooth INR weight space that facilitates seamless interpolations between
frames or videos.

Motivation: 现有方法使用Transformer捕获长距离依赖关系，但忽视了其高计算成本和局部细节提取的不足。

Method: 设计U形网络LamFormer，使用线性注意力Mamba模块捕获多尺度长距离依赖，构建并行层次特征聚合模块整合特征，设计精简Transformer全局建模上采样特征。

Result: 在七个复杂多样的数据集上优于现有分割方法，在模型性能和复杂度之间取得平衡。

Conclusion: LamFormer在多器官医学图像分割任务中表现出色，有效解决了Transformer的高计算成本和局部细节提取不足的问题。

Abstract: In the field of multi-organ medical image segmentation, recent methods
frequently employ Transformers to capture long-range dependencies from image
features. However, these methods overlook the high computational cost of
Transformers and their deficiencies in extracting local detailed information.
To address high computational costs and inadequate local detail information, we
reassess the design of feature extraction modules and propose a new
deep-learning network called LamFormer for fine-grained segmentation tasks
across multiple organs. LamFormer is a novel U-shaped network that employs
Linear Attention Mamba (LAM) in an enhanced pyramid encoder to capture
multi-scale long-range dependencies. We construct the Parallel Hierarchical
Feature Aggregation (PHFA) module to aggregate features from different layers
of the encoder, narrowing the semantic gap among features while filtering
information. Finally, we design the Reduced Transformer (RT), which utilizes a
distinct computational approach to globally model up-sampled features. RRT
enhances the extraction of detailed local information and improves the
network's capability to capture long-range dependencies. LamFormer outperforms
existing segmentation methods on seven complex and diverse datasets,
demonstrating exceptional performance. Moreover, the proposed network achieves
a balance between model performance and model complexity.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DRIFT是一种通过破坏梯度共识来增强对抗鲁棒性的随机防御方法，使用可学习滤波器训练产生梯度不协调，在保持自然预测的同时显著提升模型鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络对对抗样本高度脆弱，现有防御在梯度可估计时容易失效。研究发现梯度共识是导致对抗迁移性的关键因素，攻击者利用这种共识构造跨变换有效的扰动。

Method: 提出DRIFT方法，使用轻量级可学习滤波器组成的随机集成，通过最大化Jacobian空间和logit空间的响应差异来强制梯度不协调，同时保持自然预测准确性。

Result: 在ImageNet上对CNN和Vision Transformer都取得了显著的鲁棒性提升，优于最先进的预处理、对抗训练和基于扩散的防御方法，在自适应白盒、迁移和梯度无攻击下表现优异。

Conclusion: DRIFT以可忽略的运行时和内存成本实现了对抗防御，确立了梯度分歧作为实用且可泛化的对抗防御原则。

Abstract: Deep neural networks remain highly vulnerable to adversarial examples, and
most defenses collapse once gradients can be reliably estimated. We identify
\emph{gradient consensus} -- the tendency of randomized transformations to
yield aligned gradients -- as a key driver of adversarial transferability.
Attackers exploit this consensus to construct perturbations that remain
effective across transformations. We introduce \textbf{DRIFT} (Divergent
Response in Filtered Transformations), a stochastic ensemble of lightweight,
learnable filters trained to actively disrupt gradient consensus. Unlike prior
randomized defenses that rely on gradient masking, DRIFT enforces
\emph{gradient dissonance} by maximizing divergence in Jacobian- and
logit-space responses while preserving natural predictions. Our contributions
are threefold: (i) we formalize gradient consensus and provide a theoretical
analysis linking consensus to transferability; (ii) we propose a
consensus-divergence training strategy combining prediction consistency,
Jacobian separation, logit-space separation, and adversarial robustness; and
(iii) we show that DRIFT achieves substantial robustness gains on ImageNet
across CNNs and Vision Transformers, outperforming state-of-the-art
preprocessing, adversarial training, and diffusion-based defenses under
adaptive white-box, transfer-based, and gradient-free attacks. DRIFT delivers
these improvements with negligible runtime and memory cost, establishing
gradient divergence as a practical and generalizable principle for adversarial
defense.

Abstract: Although Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have been widely applied
across domains, they are still facing challenges in domain-specific tasks, such
as User Interface (UI) understanding accuracy and UI generation quality. In
this paper, we introduce UI-UG (a unified MLLM for UI Understanding and
Generation), integrating both capabilities. For understanding tasks, we employ
Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) combined with Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) to enhance fine-grained understanding on the modern complex UI data. For
generation tasks, we further use Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to make
our model generate human-preferred UIs. In addition, we propose an industrially
effective workflow, including the design of an LLM-friendly domain-specific
language (DSL), training strategies, rendering processes, and evaluation
metrics. In experiments, our model achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance
on understanding tasks, outperforming both larger general-purpose MLLMs and
similarly-sized UI-specialized models. Our model is also on par with these
larger MLLMs in UI generation performance at a fraction of the computational
cost. We also demonstrate that integrating understanding and generation tasks
can improve accuracy and quality for both tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Uni-X提出了一种两端分离、中间共享的X形架构，解决了统一多模态模型中视觉和文本之间的梯度冲突问题，在保持参数效率的同时实现了优越的训练效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于共享自回归变换器的统一多模态模型存在严重的梯度冲突问题，特别是在浅层和深层，这源于图像和文本在低层统计特性上的根本差异。

Method: 采用两端分离、中间共享的X形架构：初始层和最终层专用于模态特定处理，中间层保持共享参数用于高层语义融合。

Result: 在相同训练条件下，Uni-X实现了优越的训练效率。当扩展到3B参数并使用更大训练数据时，Uni-X匹配或超越了7B基于AR的UMMs，在图像生成任务中获得82的GenEval分数，同时在文本和视觉理解任务中表现强劲。

Conclusion: Uni-X为未来统一多模态建模提供了一个参数高效且可扩展的基础架构，有效解决了多模态训练中的梯度冲突问题。

Abstract: Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs) built on shared autoregressive (AR)
transformers are attractive for their architectural simplicity. However, we
identify a critical limitation: when trained on multimodal inputs,
modality-shared transformers suffer from severe gradient conflicts between
vision and text, particularly in shallow and deep layers. We trace this issue
to the fundamentally different low-level statistical properties of images and
text, while noting that conflicts diminish in middle layers where
representations become more abstract and semantically aligned. To overcome this
challenge, we propose Uni-X, a two-end-separated, middle-shared architecture.
Uni-X dedicates its initial and final layers to modality-specific processing,
while maintaining shared parameters in the middle layers for high-level
semantic fusion. This X-shaped design not only eliminates gradient conflicts at
both ends but also further alleviates residual conflicts in the shared layers.
Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of Uni-X. Under identical
training conditions, Uni-X achieves superior training efficiency compared to
strong baselines. When scaled to 3B parameters with larger training data, Uni-X
matches or surpasses 7B AR-based UMMs, achieving a GenEval score of 82 for
image generation alongside strong performance in text and vision understanding
tasks. These results establish Uni-X as a parameter-efficient and scalable

*Jinhee Park,Guisik Kim,Choongsang Cho,Junseok Kwon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出R²M框架，通过模型融合解决深度伪造检测问题，无需重新训练即可适应新伪造方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度伪造生成器快速进化，使得数据收集和重复训练不切实际。模型融合适合深度伪造检测，因为专家模型共享相同的二元决策，仅在生成器特定伪影上有所不同

Method: 提出Real-aware Residual Model Merging (R²M)框架：通过任务向量的低秩分解估计共享Real组件，将每个专家模型分解为Real对齐部分和Fake残差，使用层级秩截断对残差去噪，并通过每任务范数匹配聚合以防止单一生成器主导

Result: 在分布内、跨数据集和未见数据集上，R²M优于联合训练和其他融合基线方法。R²M具有可组合性，当新伪造家族出现时，只需微调一个专家模型并重新融合

Conclusion: R²M提供了一种无需重新训练即可适应新深度伪造方法的有效解决方案，通过模型融合实现了优越的检测性能

Abstract: Deepfake generators evolve quickly, making exhaustive data collection and
repeated retraining impractical. We argue that model merging is a natural fit
for deepfake detection: unlike generic multi-task settings with disjoint
labels, deepfake specialists share the same binary decision and differ in
generator-specific artifacts. Empirically, we show that simple weight averaging
preserves Real representations while attenuating Fake-specific cues. Building
upon these findings, we propose Real-aware Residual Model Merging (R$^2$M), a
training-free parameter-space merging framework. R$^2$M estimates a shared Real
component via a low-rank factorization of task vectors, decomposes each
specialist into a Real-aligned part and a Fake residual, denoises residuals
with layerwise rank truncation, and aggregates them with per-task norm matching
to prevent any single generator from dominating. A concise rationale explains
why a simple head suffices: the Real component induces a common separation
direction in feature space, while truncated residuals contribute only minor
off-axis variations. Across in-distribution, cross-dataset, and unseen-dataset,
R$^2$M outperforms joint training and other merging baselines. Importantly,
R$^2$M is also composable: when a new forgery family appears, we fine-tune one
specialist and re-merge, eliminating the need for retraining.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 街景图像是重要的地理空间数据源，但从卫星图像合成街景图像面临外观和视角差异的挑战，需要解决地理一致性问题。

Method: 采用多阶段训练策略，将Stable Diffusion作为双分支架构的核心组件，集成条件GAN生成全景街景，并通过融合策略结合两种模型的优势。

Result: 在CVUSA数据集上的实验表明，该混合方法在多个评估指标上优于纯扩散方法，生成具有几何一致性和精细细节的逼真街景图像。

Conclusion: 该混合框架成功解决了跨视角图像合成的挑战，能够生成地理一致且视觉质量高的街景图像，为城市分析提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Street view imagery has become an essential source for geospatial data
collection and urban analytics, enabling the extraction of valuable insights
that support informed decision-making. However, synthesizing street-view images
from corresponding satellite imagery presents significant challenges due to
substantial differences in appearance and viewing perspective between these two
domains. This paper presents a hybrid framework that integrates diffusion-based
models and conditional generative adversarial networks to generate
geographically consistent street-view images from satellite imagery. Our
approach uses a multi-stage training strategy that incorporates Stable
Diffusion as the core component within a dual-branch architecture. To enhance
the framework's capabilities, we integrate a conditional Generative Adversarial
Network (GAN) that enables the generation of geographically consistent
panoramic street views. Furthermore, we implement a fusion strategy that
leverages the strengths of both models to create robust representations,
thereby improving the geometric consistency and visual quality of the generated
street-view images. The proposed framework is evaluated on the challenging
Cross-View USA (CVUSA) dataset, a standard benchmark for cross-view image
synthesis. Experimental results demonstrate that our hybrid approach
outperforms diffusion-only methods across multiple evaluation metrics and
achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art GAN-based
methods. The framework successfully generates realistic and geometrically
consistent street-view images while preserving fine-grained local details,
including street markings, secondary roads, and atmospheric elements such as
clouds.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖几何信息，虽然一些研究引入了颜色信息，但未能充分利用图像中的纹理和语义信息，且特征融合存在信息损失。

Method: 使用DINOv2提取图像视觉特征，在patch级别融合视觉和几何特征，提出混合位置编码同时编码图像和点云空间的位置信息。

Result: 在RGBD-3DMatch和RGBD-3DLoMatch数据集上，相比现有方法，patch内点率提升14.2%，配准召回率提升15.7%。

Conclusion: DINOReg通过充分利用视觉和几何信息，在点云配准任务中取得了显著改进，证明了多模态融合的有效性。

Abstract: Point cloud registration is a fundamental task in 3D computer vision. Most
existing methods rely solely on geometric information for feature extraction
and matching. Recently, several studies have incorporated color information
from RGB-D data into feature extraction. Although these methods achieve
remarkable improvements, they have not fully exploited the abundant texture and
semantic information in images, and the feature fusion is performed in an
image-lossy manner, which limit their performance. In this paper, we propose
DINOReg, a registration network that sufficiently utilizes both visual and
geometric information to solve the point cloud registration problem. Inspired
by advances in vision foundation models, we employ DINOv2 to extract
informative visual features from images, and fuse visual and geometric features
at the patch level. This design effectively combines the rich texture and
global semantic information extracted by DINOv2 with the detailed geometric
structure information captured by the geometric backbone. Additionally, a mixed
positional embedding is proposed to encode positional information from both
image space and point cloud space, which enhances the model's ability to
perceive spatial relationships between patches. Extensive experiments on the
RGBD-3DMatch and RGBD-3DLoMatch datasets demonstrate that our method achieves
significant improvements over state-of-the-art geometry-only and multi-modal
registration methods, with a 14.2% increase in patch inlier ratio and a 15.7%
increase in registration recall. The code is publicly available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了MCAE（掩码聚类标注引擎），通过将语义一致的掩码组作为最小标注单元，显著提高了亚米级遥感图像标注效率1-2个数量级，并构建了包含约140亿标注像素的HiCity-LC数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 亚米级遥感图像虽然提供了丰富的细节信息，但由于缺乏高质量标注数据集，其在大规模土地覆盖制图方面的潜力未能充分发挥。现有标注方法成本高昂且不可靠。

Method: 基于空间自相关原理，将语义一致的掩码组作为最小标注单元，实现多个实例的同时标注。MCAE通过掩码聚类方法提升标注效率。

Result: 构建了HiCity-LC数据集，包含约140亿标注像素，支持在五个中国主要城市生成分类精度超过85%的城市级土地覆盖图。这是首个公开可用的亚米级城市级土地覆盖基准数据集。

Conclusion: MCAE展示了在大规模亚米级制图中的可扩展性和实用价值，显著提升了标注效率同时保持了标签质量、语义多样性和空间代表性。

Abstract: Recent advances in remote sensing technology have made submeter resolution
imagery increasingly accessible, offering remarkable detail for fine-grained
land cover analysis. However, its full potential remains underutilized -
particularly for large-scale land cover mapping - due to the lack of
sufficient, high-quality annotated datasets. Existing labels are typically
derived from pre-existing products or manual annotation, which are often
unreliable or prohibitively expensive, particularly given the rich visual
detail and massive data volumes of submeter imagery. Inspired by the spatial
autocorrelation principle, which suggests that objects of the same class tend
to co-occur with similar visual features in local neighborhoods, we propose the
Mask Clustering-based Annotation Engine (MCAE), which treats semantically
consistent mask groups as the minimal annotating units to enable efficient,
simultaneous annotation of multiple instances. It significantly improves
annotation efficiency by one to two orders of magnitude, while preserving label
quality, semantic diversity, and spatial representativeness. With MCAE, we
build a high-quality annotated dataset of about 14 billion labeled pixels,
referred to as HiCity-LC, which supports the generation of city-scale land
cover maps across five major Chinese cities with classification accuracies
above 85%. It is the first publicly available submeter resolution city-level
land cover benchmark, highlighting the scalability and practical utility of
MCAE for large-scale, submeter resolution mapping. The dataset is available at

*Soumyadeep Chandra,Kaushik Roy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: REALIGN是一个基于正则化融合部分Gromov-Wasserstein最优传输的自监督框架，用于解决程序视频学习中的背景段、重复动作和非单调步骤顺序等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界的教学数据包含背景段、重复动作和乱序步骤，这违反了传统对齐方法的单调性假设。现有方法仅依赖特征相似性，无法捕捉任务的高阶时间结构。

Method: 使用正则化融合部分Gromov-Wasserstein最优传输(R-FPGWOT)，联合建模视觉对应关系和时间关系，结合序列间对比学习来稳定训练。

Result: 在EgoProceL、ProceL和CrossTask基准测试中，REALIGN实现了最高18.9%的平均F1分数提升和超过30%的时间IoU增益，产生更可解释的传输映射。

Conclusion: REALIGN通过部分对齐方案和联合建模方法，能够鲁棒地处理教学视频中的噪声和乱序问题，在程序学习任务上表现出色。

Abstract: Learning from procedural videos remains a core challenge in self-supervised
representation learning, as real-world instructional data often contains
background segments, repeated actions, and steps presented out of order. Such
variability violates the strong monotonicity assumptions underlying many
alignment methods. Prior state-of-the-art approaches, such as OPEL, leverage
Kantorovich Optimal Transport (KOT) to build frame-to-frame correspondences,
but rely solely on feature similarity and fail to capture the higher-order
temporal structure of a task. In this paper, we introduce REALIGN, a
self-supervised framework for procedure learning based on Regularized Fused
Partial Gromov-Wasserstein Optimal Transport (R-FPGWOT). In contrast to KOT,
our formulation jointly models visual correspondences and temporal relations
under a partial alignment scheme, enabling robust handling of irrelevant
frames, repeated actions, and non-monotonic step orders common in instructional
videos. To stabilize training, we integrate FPGWOT distances with
inter-sequence contrastive learning, avoiding the need for multiple
regularizers and preventing collapse to degenerate solutions. Across egocentric
(EgoProceL) and third-person (ProceL, CrossTask) benchmarks, REALIGN achieves
up to 18.9% average F1-score improvements and over 30% temporal IoU gains,
while producing more interpretable transport maps that preserve key-step
orderings and filter out noise.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的3D多模态大语言模型依赖3D数据输入，限制了可扩展性和泛化能力。为了解决这一限制，作者提出直接从视频输入处理3D场景理解，使其更适合实际部署。

Conclusion: Vid-LLM通过视频输入实现了无需外部3D数据的3D场景理解，在多个3D视觉语言任务上表现出色，为实际应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent developments in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have
significantly improved Vision-Language (VL) reasoning in 2D domains. However,
extending these capabilities to 3D scene understanding remains a major
challenge. Existing 3D Multimodal Large Language Models (3D-MLLMs) often depend
on 3D data inputs, which limits scalability and generalization. To address this
limitation, we propose Vid-LLM, a video-based 3D-MLLM that directly processes
video inputs without requiring external 3D data, making it practical for
real-world deployment. In our method, the geometric prior are directly used to
improve the performance of the sceen perception. To integrate the geometric
cues into the MLLM compactly, we design a Cross-Task Adapter (CTA) module to
align the 3D geometric priors with the vision-language representations. To
ensure geometric consistency and integrity, we introduce a Metric Depth Model
that recovers real-scale geometry from the reconstruction outputs. Finally, the
model is fine-tuned with a two-stage distillation optimization strategy,
realizing fast convergence and stabilizes training. Extensive experiments
across diverse benchmarks verified the effectiveness of our method on 3D
Question Answering, 3D Dense Captioning and 3D Visual Grounding tasks,
demonstrating the superior multi-task capabilities.

TL;DR: 提出了PCICF框架，用于系统识别和分类VRU（易受伤害道路使用者）情况，支持ODD（操作设计域）的事故分析。基于SMIRK数据集扩展为MoreSMIRK多行人穿越场景字典，使用空间填充曲线进行特征匹配，并在真实数据集PIE上验证有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着robotaxi的商业部署，需要可靠检测行人、自行车等VRU。端到端AI系统需要高质量数据来训练和评估，特别是在ODD内。需要系统化识别和分类VRU情况来支持事故分析。

Method: 1. 扩展SMIRK数据集为MoreSMIRK多行人穿越场景字典；2. 使用空间填充曲线（SFCs）将多维场景特征转换为特征模式；3. 与MoreSMIRK中的条目进行匹配；4. 在真实数据集PIE上进行评估。

Conclusion: PCICF提供了一个系统化的框架来识别和分类VRU情况，支持robotaxi的ODD事故分析。通过高效的计算组件，该框架具有实际部署的潜力。

Abstract: We have recently observed the commercial roll-out of robotaxis in various
countries. They are deployed within an operational design domain (ODD) on
specific routes and environmental conditions, and are subject to continuous
monitoring to regain control in safety-critical situations. Since ODDs
typically cover urban areas, robotaxis must reliably detect vulnerable road
users (VRUs) such as pedestrians, bicyclists, or e-scooter riders. To better
handle such varied traffic situations, end-to-end AI, which directly compute
vehicle control actions from multi-modal sensor data instead of only for
perception, is on the rise. High quality data is needed for systematically
training and evaluating such systems within their OOD. In this work, we propose
PCICF, a framework to systematically identify and classify VRU situations to
support ODD's incident analysis. We base our work on the existing synthetic
dataset SMIRK, and enhance it by extending its single-pedestrian-only design
into the MoreSMIRK dataset, a structured dictionary of multi-pedestrian
crossing situations constructed systematically. We then use space-filling
curves (SFCs) to transform multi-dimensional features of scenarios into
characteristic patterns, which we match with corresponding entries in
MoreSMIRK. We evaluate PCICF with the large real-world dataset PIE, which
contains more than 150 manually annotated pedestrian crossing videos. We show
that PCICF can successfully identify and classify complex pedestrian crossings,
even when groups of pedestrians merge or split. By leveraging computationally
efficient components like SFCs, PCICF has even potential to be used onboard of
robotaxis for OOD detection for example. We share an open-source replication
package for PCICF containing its algorithms, the complete MoreSMIRK dataset and
dictionary, as well as our experiment results presented in:

bridge to generating synthetic 3D assets. In this work, we introduce RapidMV, a
novel text-to-multi-view generative model that can produce 32 multi-view

spatio-angular latent space, encoding both the spatial appearance and angular
viewpoint deviations into a single latent for improved efficiency and
multi-view consistency. We achieve effective training of RapidMV by
strategically decomposing our training process into multiple steps. We
demonstrate that RapidMV outperforms existing methods in terms of consistency
and latency, with competitive quality and text-image alignment.

*Kai Liu,Shaoqiu Zhang,Linghe Kong,Yulun Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLQ是一种针对扩散变换器（DiTs）的跨层引导正交量化方法，通过交叉块校准、正交平滑和跨层参数搜索三个关键技术，在W4A4量化下实现几乎无损的视觉生成质量，同时获得3.98倍内存节省和3.95倍加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散变换器（DiTs）的模型规模和复杂性增长虽然提升了视觉生成质量，但也阻碍了其在边缘设备上的实际部署。模型后训练量化（PTQ）作为一种高效压缩技术，可以减少内存消耗和加速推理，但会带来性能下降。

Method: 1. 交叉块校准（CBC）：获取准确的校准数据以更好地指导量化；2. 正交平滑（OBS）：量化每个通道的异常值分数，利用块Hadamard矩阵平滑异常值；3. 跨层参数搜索（CLPS）：搜索最优参数配置。

Result: 在图像生成和视频生成模型上评估CLQ，成功将模型压缩到W4A4量化，视觉质量和指标下降可忽略不计。实现了3.98倍内存节省和3.95倍加速。

Conclusion: CLQ方法有效解决了DiTs模型在边缘设备部署时的量化性能下降问题，为高效部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Visual generation quality has been greatly promoted with the rapid advances
in diffusion transformers (DiTs), which is attributed to the scaling of model
size and complexity. However, these attributions also hinder the practical
deployment of DiTs on edge devices, limiting their development and application.
Serve as an efficient model compression technique, model post-training
quantization (PTQ) can reduce the memory consumption and speed up the
inference, with inevitable performance degradation. To alleviate the
degradation, we propose CLQ, a cross-layer guided orthogonal-based quantization
method for DiTs. To be specific, CLQ consists of three key designs. First, we
observe that the calibration data used by most of the PTQ methods can not
honestly represent the distribution of the activations. Therefore, we propose
cross-block calibration (CBC) to obtain accurate calibration data, with which
the quantization can be better guided. Second, we propose orthogonal-based
smoothing (OBS), which quantifies the outlier score of each channel and
leverages block Hadamard matrix to smooth the outliers with negligible
overhead. Third, we propose cross-layer parameter searching (CLPS) to search.
We evaluate CLQ with both image generation and video generation models and
successfully compress the model into W4A4 with negligible degradation in visual
quality and metrics. CLQ achieves 3.98x memory saving and 3.95x speedup. Our
code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着模型架构成熟，数据质量成为关键因素，但图像领域缺乏系统性的数据集质量评估研究。

Method: 使用CIFAKE数据集识别常见质量问题，开发结合CleanVision和Fastdup的流程，引入自动阈值选择等增强功能。

Result: 自动阈值方法在单扰动下F1分数从0.6794提升至0.9468，双扰动下从0.7447提升至0.8557；去重策略F1分数从0.4576提升至0.7928。

Conclusion: 不同质量问题对模型影响不同，CNN对模糊和严重下采样等遮挡关键视觉特征的退化特别敏感，提出的工作流程为图像机器学习中的数据质量评估提供了有效基础。

Abstract: In machine learning, research has traditionally focused on model development,
with relatively less attention paid to training data. As model architectures
have matured and marginal gains from further refinements diminish, data quality
has emerged as a critical factor. However, systematic studies on evaluating and
ensuring dataset quality in the image domain remain limited.
  This study investigates methods for systematically assessing image dataset
quality and examines how various image quality factors influence model
performance. Using the publicly available and relatively clean CIFAKE dataset,
we identify common quality issues and quantify their impact on training.
Building on these findings, we develop a pipeline that integrates two
community-developed tools, CleanVision and Fastdup. We analyze their underlying
mechanisms and introduce several enhancements, including automatic threshold
selection to detect problematic images without manual tuning.
  Experimental results demonstrate that not all quality issues exert the same
level of impact. While convolutional neural networks show resilience to certain
distortions, they are particularly vulnerable to degradations that obscure
critical visual features, such as blurring and severe downscaling. To assess
the performance of existing tools and the effectiveness of our proposed
enhancements, we formulate the detection of low-quality images as a binary
classification task and use the F1 score as the evaluation metric. Our
automatic thresholding method improves the F1 score from 0.6794 to 0.9468 under
single perturbations and from 0.7447 to 0.8557 under dual perturbations. For
near-duplicate detection, our deduplication strategy increases the F1 score
from 0.4576 to 0.7928. These results underscore the effectiveness of our
workflow and provide a foundation for advancing data quality assessment in
image-based machine learning.

TL;DR: Proxy-GS是一种新颖的3D高斯溅射方法，通过引入代理系统实现遮挡感知，在保持渲染质量的同时显著提升渲染速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的3D高斯溅射方法存在显著的冗余问题，主要原因是缺乏遮挡感知能力，导致渲染效率低下。

Method: 提出Proxy-GS管道，利用快速代理系统在1ms内生成1000x1000分辨率的精确遮挡深度图，指导锚点和高斯原语的剔除以及训练过程中的致密化。

Result: 在MatrixCity Streets等重度遮挡场景中，Proxy-GS不仅提升了MLP基高斯溅射的渲染能力，还实现了超过2.5倍的渲染速度提升，同时保持更高的渲染质量。

Conclusion: Proxy-GS通过引入遮挡感知代理系统，有效解决了3D高斯溅射中的冗余问题，在提升渲染速度的同时保证了视觉保真度。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as an efficient approach for
achieving photorealistic rendering. Recent MLP-based variants further improve
visual fidelity but introduce substantial decoding overhead during rendering.
To alleviate computation cost, several pruning strategies and level-of-detail
(LOD) techniques have been introduced, aiming to effectively reduce the number
of Gaussian primitives in large-scale scenes. However, our analysis reveals
that significant redundancy still remains due to the lack of occlusion
awareness. In this work, we propose Proxy-GS, a novel pipeline that exploits a
proxy to introduce Gaussian occlusion awareness from any view. At the core of
our approach is a fast proxy system capable of producing precise occlusion
depth maps at a resolution of 1000x1000 under 1ms. This proxy serves two roles:
first, it guides the culling of anchors and Gaussians to accelerate rendering
speed. Second, it guides the densification towards surfaces during training,
avoiding inconsistencies in occluded regions, and improving the rendering
quality. In heavily occluded scenarios, such as the MatrixCity Streets dataset,
Proxy-GS not only equips MLP-based Gaussian splatting with stronger rendering
capability but also achieves faster rendering speed. Specifically, it achieves
more than 2.5x speedup over Octree-GS, and consistently delivers substantially
higher rendering quality. Code will be public upon acceptance.

Motivation: 解决现有方法仅依赖外观相似性隐式学习光流估计的问题，特别是处理模态差异和几何错位挑战。

Method: 提出解耦优化策略，协同训练模态转换网络和光流估计网络；设计几何感知数据合成流程和异常鲁棒损失；引入跨模态一致性约束联合优化两个网络。

Result: 构建了全面的跨模态光流基准测试，实验表明DCFlow可与多种光流估计网络集成，在无监督方法中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: DCFlow通过解耦优化和跨模态一致性约束，有效解决了跨模态光流估计中的模态差异和几何错位问题，为无监督跨模态运动估计提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: This work presents DCFlow, a novel unsupervised cross-modal flow estimation
framework that integrates a decoupled optimization strategy and a cross-modal
consistency constraint. Unlike previous approaches that implicitly learn flow
estimation solely from appearance similarity, we introduce a decoupled
optimization strategy with task-specific supervision to address modality
discrepancy and geometric misalignment distinctly. This is achieved by
collaboratively training a modality transfer network and a flow estimation
network. To enable reliable motion supervision without ground-truth flow, we
propose a geometry-aware data synthesis pipeline combined with an
outlier-robust loss. Additionally, we introduce a cross-modal consistency
constraint to jointly optimize both networks, significantly improving flow
prediction accuracy. For evaluation, we construct a comprehensive cross-modal
flow benchmark by repurposing public datasets. Experimental results demonstrate
that DCFlow can be integrated with various flow estimation networks and
achieves state-of-the-art performance among unsupervised approaches.

Result: 评估了开源和闭源的I2V模型，并进行了人工评估，结果显示提出的MLLM指标与人工评估高度一致。

Conclusion: UI2V-Bench填补了I2V评估中语义理解和推理能力的关键空白，为该领域未来研究和模型开发提供了稳健的框架和数据集。

Abstract: Generative diffusion models are developing rapidly and attracting increasing
attention due to their wide range of applications. Image-to-Video (I2V)
generation has become a major focus in the field of video synthesis. However,
existing evaluation benchmarks primarily focus on aspects such as video quality
and temporal consistency, while largely overlooking the model's ability to
understand the semantics of specific subjects in the input image or to ensure
that the generated video aligns with physical laws and human commonsense. To
address this gap, we propose UI2V-Bench, a novel benchmark for evaluating I2V
models with a focus on semantic understanding and reasoning. It introduces four
primary evaluation dimensions: spatial understanding, attribute binding,
category understanding, and reasoning. To assess these dimensions, we design
two evaluation methods based on Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs): an
instance-level pipeline for fine-grained semantic understanding, and a
feedback-based reasoning pipeline that enables step-by-step causal assessment
for more accurate evaluation. UI2V-Bench includes approximately 500 carefully
constructed text-image pairs and evaluates a range of both open source and
closed-source I2V models across all defined dimensions. We further incorporate
human evaluations, which show strong alignment with the proposed MLLM-based
metrics. Overall, UI2V-Bench fills a critical gap in I2V evaluation by
emphasizing semantic comprehension and reasoning ability, offering a robust
framework and dataset to support future research and model development in the
field.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NeoWorld是一个从单张输入图像生成交互式3D虚拟世界的深度学习框架，采用混合场景结构实现高效渲染和灵活视角操控。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受科幻小说《Simulacron-3》按需构建世界概念的启发，旨在创建只在用户探索区域进行高真实感渲染的扩展环境。

Method: 使用混合场景结构：对关键前景对象进行完整3D建模，同时对背景和未交互区域进行2D合成以确保效率，结合先进的表示学习和对象到3D技术。

Result: 在WorldScore基准测试中显著优于现有的2D和深度分层2.5D方法，支持灵活视角操控和物理合理的场景动画。

Conclusion: NeoWorld通过渐进式展开3D细节，为用户提供动态、沉浸且视觉连贯的探索体验。

Abstract: We introduce NeoWorld, a deep learning framework for generating interactive
3D virtual worlds from a single input image. Inspired by the on-demand
worldbuilding concept in the science fiction novel Simulacron-3 (1964), our
system constructs expansive environments where only the regions actively
explored by the user are rendered with high visual realism through
object-centric 3D representations. Unlike previous approaches that rely on
global world generation or 2D hallucination, NeoWorld models key foreground
objects in full 3D, while synthesizing backgrounds and non-interacted regions
in 2D to ensure efficiency. This hybrid scene structure, implemented with
cutting-edge representation learning and object-to-3D techniques, enables
flexible viewpoint manipulation and physically plausible scene animation,
allowing users to control object appearance and dynamics using natural language
commands. As users interact with the environment, the virtual world
progressively unfolds with increasing 3D detail, delivering a dynamic,
immersive, and visually coherent exploration experience. NeoWorld significantly
outperforms existing 2D and depth-layered 2.5D methods on the WorldScore
benchmark.

*Jianxin Liang,Tan Yue,Yuxuan Wang,Yueqian Wang,Zhihan Yin,Huishuai Zhang,Dongyan Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个框架，通过问题转述和问题字幕两种策略合成更丰富的监督信号，提升视频问答模型的性能，在STAR和NExT-QA数据集上取得了新的最先进结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视频问答模型的监督信号局限于孤立的事实问答对，无法捕捉事件的叙事和因果结构，限制了模型对视频内容的深度理解。

Method: 提出两种互补策略：问题转述将多样化的问答对合成为重构视频事件结构的叙事段落；问题字幕为每个问题生成细粒度的视觉依据，将答案锚定在具体相关证据上。利用生成模型合成数据，在统一的下一个词预测目标下训练视频问答模型。

Result: 在STAR和NExT-QA数据集上验证了方法的有效性，显著提升准确率并建立新的最先进结果：3B模型在STAR上达到72.5%（提升4.9%），7B模型在NExT-QA上达到80.8%。QBP和QBC都显著增强跨数据集泛化能力，QBP还加速模型收敛超过2.5倍。

Conclusion: 从孤立事实转向叙事连贯性和有依据的推理的数据合成方法，能够产生更准确、高效和可泛化的训练范式。

Abstract: The performance of Video Question Answering (VideoQA) models is fundamentally
constrained by the nature of their supervision, which typically consists of
isolated, factual question-answer pairs. This "bag-of-facts" approach fails to
capture the underlying narrative and causal structure of events, limiting
models to a shallow understanding of video content. To move beyond this
paradigm, we introduce a framework to synthesize richer supervisory signals. We
propose two complementary strategies: Question-Based Paraphrasing (QBP), which
synthesizes the diverse inquiries (what, how, why) from a video's existing set
of question-answer pairs into a holistic narrative paragraph that reconstructs
the video's event structure; and Question-Based Captioning (QBC), which
generates fine-grained visual rationales, grounding the answer to each question
in specific, relevant evidence. Leveraging powerful generative models, we use
this synthetic data to train VideoQA models under a unified next-token
prediction objective. Extensive experiments on STAR and NExT-QA validate our
approach, demonstrating significant accuracy gains and establishing new
state-of-the-art results, such as improving a 3B model to 72.5\% on STAR
(+4.9\%) and a 7B model to 80.8\% on NExT-QA. Beyond accuracy, our analysis
reveals that both QBP and QBC substantially enhance cross-dataset
generalization, with QBP additionally accelerating model convergence by over
2.5x. These results demonstrate that shifting data synthesis from isolated
facts to narrative coherence and grounded rationales yields a more accurate,
efficient, and generalizable training paradigm.

TL;DR: 提出基于知识蒸馏的双模型集成方法，通过教师-学生架构结合编码器-解码器和编码器-编码器模型，实现工业异常检测和语义异常检测的统一框架，在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有异常检测方法往往偏向工业检测，难以泛化到语义异常检测等更广泛任务，且性能对数据集设置和单类任务敏感，需要开发通用性更强的异常检测方法。

Method: 使用知识蒸馏的双模型集成框架，包含教师模型和两个学生模型：编码器-解码器模型（专注工业异常检测）和编码器-编码器模型（专注语义异常检测），共享DINOv2预训练编码器，通过Noisy-OR目标联合学习，结合局部和语义异常得分计算最终异常概率。

Result: 在8个公开基准测试中（MVTec-AD、MVTec-LOCO、VisA、Real-IAD、CIFAR-10/100、FMNIST、View）均取得最先进性能，MVTec-AD图像级AUROC达99.7%，CIFAR-10达97.8%，在单类和多类设置下均优于现有通用异常检测模型。

Conclusion: 所提方法在工业异常检测和语义异常检测两个领域都表现出优异的泛化能力，在单类和多类设置下均达到最先进水平，证明了跨多个异常检测领域的通用性。

Abstract: Anomaly detection (AD) plays an important role in various real-world
applications. Recent advancements in AD, however, are often biased towards
industrial inspection, struggle to generalize to broader tasks like semantic
anomaly detection and vice versa. Although recent methods have attempted to
address general anomaly detection, their performance remains sensitive to
dataset-specific settings and single-class tasks. In this paper, we propose a
novel dual-model ensemble approach based on knowledge distillation (KD) to
bridge this gap. Our framework consists of a teacher and two student models: an
Encoder-Decoder model, specialized in detecting patch-level minor defects for
industrial AD and an Encoder-Encoder model, optimized for semantic AD. Both
models leverage a shared pre-trained encoder (DINOv2) to extract high-quality
feature representations. The dual models are jointly learned using the Noisy-OR
objective, and the final anomaly score is obtained using the joint probability
via local and semantic anomaly scores derived from the respective models. We
evaluate our method on eight public benchmarks under both single-class and
multi-class settings: MVTec-AD, MVTec-LOCO, VisA and Real-IAD for industrial
inspection and CIFAR-10/100, FMNIST and View for semantic anomaly detection.
The proposed method achieved state-of-the-art accuracies in both domains, in
multi-class as well as single-class settings, demonstrating generalization
across multiple domains of anomaly detection. Our model achieved an image-level
AUROC of 99.7% on MVTec-AD and 97.8% on CIFAR-10, which is significantly better
than the prior general AD models in multi-class settings and even higher than
the best specialist models on individual benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到运动生成方法在细粒度表达性运动控制方面存在挑战，主要由于数据集缺乏运动风格多样性和自然语言难以表达定量特征。Laban运动分析被舞蹈专家广泛用于尽可能一致地表达运动细节。

Method: 提出零样本推理时优化方法，将Laban Effort和Shape组件的量化方法无缝集成到文本引导运动生成模型中。通过在采样步骤更新预训练扩散模型的文本嵌入，引导运动生成模型获得所需的Laban组件，无需额外运动数据。

Result: 该方法能够产生多样化的表达性运动质量，同时通过成功根据目标Laban标签操纵运动属性来保持运动身份。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了人类运动生成的可解释和表达性控制，通过Laban组件量化方法有效解决了细粒度运动控制问题。

Abstract: Diverse human motion generation is an increasingly important task, having
various applications in computer vision, human-computer interaction and
animation. While text-to-motion synthesis using diffusion models has shown
success in generating high-quality motions, achieving fine-grained expressive
motion control remains a significant challenge. This is due to the lack of
motion style diversity in datasets and the difficulty of expressing
quantitative characteristics in natural language. Laban movement analysis has
been widely used by dance experts to express the details of motion including
motion quality as consistent as possible. Inspired by that, this work aims for
interpretable and expressive control of human motion generation by seamlessly
integrating the quantification methods of Laban Effort and Shape components
into the text-guided motion generation models. Our proposed zero-shot,
inference-time optimization method guides the motion generation model to have
desired Laban Effort and Shape components without any additional motion data by
updating the text embedding of pretrained diffusion models during the sampling
step. We demonstrate that our approach yields diverse expressive motion
qualities while preserving motion identity by successfully manipulating motion
attributes according to target Laban tags.

Method: 构建包含3万道平面和立体几何问题的Euclid30K数据集，使用组相对策略优化方法微调Qwen2.5VL和RoboBrain2.0系列模型。

Result: 模型在四个空间推理基准测试中实现显著的零样本提升，VSI-Bench平均准确率从34.5%提高到40.5%，RoboBrain2.0-Euclid-7B达到49.6%准确率，超越之前最优模型。

Conclusion: 这是首个系统研究表明以几何为中心的微调可以为视觉语言模型带来广泛可迁移的空间技能。

Abstract: Spatial intelligence spans a rich suite of abilities, including visualising
and transforming shapes, mentally rotating objects, judging relational
positions and containment, and estimating numerosity. However, it still remains
a critical unresolved challenge for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs).To
fill this gap, we propose to treat Euclidean geometry problem-solving as a
surrogate task. Specifically, we meticulously constructed a curated multimodal
dataset, called Euclid30K, comprising approximately 30K plane and solid
geometry problems. To enable the model to acquire and apply Euclidean
principles from these geometry problems, we employed Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) to finetune the Qwen2.5VL family and RoboBrain2.0 family,
inspiring the models to identify shapes, count, and relate entities, and
perform multi-step deductive reasoning using Euclidean principles. Our
experiments demonstrate that the resulting models achieve substantial zero-shot
gains across four spatial reasoning benchmarks (Super-CLEVR, Omni3DBench,
VSI-Bench, and MindCube) without any task-specific adaptations. Notably, after
training on the Euclid30K, the mean VSI-Bench accuracy of all evaluated models
rose from 34.5% to 40.5%, improving by 5.5 percentage points. Among them,
RoboBrain2.0-Euclid-7B achieves 49.6\% accuracy, surpassing the previous
state-of-the-art model, Spatial-MLLM.To our knowledge, this is the first
systematic study showing that geometry-centric fine-tuning can confer
vision-language models with broadly transferable spatial skills. Code and
Euclid30K dataset can be found in https://zgca-ai4edu.github.io/Euclids_Gift.

TL;DR: 提出了一种选择性表示框架，可将二手服装图像检索数据库缩小至原始大小的10%而不损失检索精度，通过聚类和核心集选择方法来识别代表性样本，并引入基于邻域一致性得分的异常值去除方法。


<details>

Motivation: 时尚产业是浪费和排放的主要来源，促进二手市场发展具有重要意义。机器学习方法在大规模评估二手服装价值方面发挥重要作用，但需要解决二手图像检索的可扩展性问题。

Method: 采用聚类和核心集选择方法识别代表性样本，捕捉服装关键特征及其内部变异性；引入基于邻域一致性得分的异常值去除方法，在筛选前过滤非典型样本。

Result: 在DeepFashion Attribute、DeepFashion Con2Shop和DeepFashion2三个公开数据集上的评估显示，该方法在保持接近最优精度的同时，通过减少向量数据库中的图像数量显著降低计算成本。异常值去除方法结合聚类技术可进一步提高检索性能。

Conclusion: 通过战略性修剪和选择代表性图像向量，实现了性能与效率的权衡，为二手服装市场的可扩展图像检索提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The fashion industry has been identified as a major contributor to waste and
emissions, leading to an increased interest in promoting the second-hand
market. Machine learning methods play an important role in facilitating the
creation and expansion of second-hand marketplaces by enabling the large-scale
valuation of used garments. We contribute to this line of work by addressing
the scalability of second-hand image retrieval from databases. By introducing a
selective representation framework, we can shrink databases to 10% of their
original size without sacrificing retrieval accuracy. We first explore
clustering and coreset selection methods to identify representative samples
that capture the key features of each garment and its internal variability.
Then, we introduce an efficient outlier removal method, based on a
neighbour-homogeneity consistency score measure, that filters out
uncharacteristic samples prior to selection. We evaluate our approach on three
public datasets: DeepFashion Attribute, DeepFashion Con2Shop, and DeepFashion2.
The results demonstrate a clear performance-efficiency trade-off by
strategically pruning and selecting representative vectors of images. The
retrieval system maintains near-optimal accuracy, while greatly reducing
computational costs by reducing the images added to the vector database.
Furthermore, applying our outlier removal method to clustering techniques
yields even higher retrieval performance by removing non-discriminative samples
before the selection.

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在视觉幻觉问题上表现不佳，现有DPO方法无法捕捉细粒度语义差异并鼓励捷径学习

Method: SCPO框架使用基于语义课程偏好对数据集的渐进式易到难课程，结合动态参考模型和对称双向目标进行训练

Result: 在LLaVA模型上的实验显示，SCPO在多个幻觉基准上表现优异，幻觉率降低高达62.9%，同时保持通用能力

Conclusion: SCPO是首个统一语义、对称性和课程学习的MLLM对齐框架，能有效缓解视觉幻觉问题

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly improved the
performance of various tasks, but continue to suffer from visual
hallucinations, a critical issue where generated responses contradict visual
evidence. While Direct Preference Optimization(DPO) is widely used for
alignment, its application to MLLMs often fails to capture fine-grained
semantic differences and encourages shortcut learning. To address these
challenges, we propose Semantic Curriculum Preference Optimization (SCPO), a
novel framework for MLLM alignment. SCPO employs a progressive, easy-to-hard
curriculum built upon our Semantic Curriculum Preference Pairs dataset, which
provides fine-grained semantic contrasts sorted by difficulty. This curriculum
is trained with a dynamic reference model and a novel symmetric, bidirectional
objective to facilitate simultaneous learning from both textual and visual
preferences. To our knowledge, SCPO is the first framework to unify semantics,
symmetry, and curriculum for MLLMs alignment, effectively mitigating visual
hallucinations. Extensive experiments on LLaVA models across various scales and
versions validate that SCPO demonstrates superior performance compared to
baseline models on multiple hallucination benchmarks, reducing the
hallucination rate by up to 62.9%. Moreover, evaluations on generalized
benchmarks show that SCPO improves factuality while preserving general
capabilities, with its performance remaining stable across general
vision-language benchmarks.

Method: 提出EQUISeg框架，基于四阶段跨模态Transformer块实现模态均衡编码，设计自引导模块通过相互引导机制自适应调整模态贡献

Result: 在多个数据集上的广泛实验表明，EQUISeg实现了显著的性能提升，有效缓解了分割任务中模态不平衡的不利影响

Conclusion: EQUISeg通过均衡模态贡献和相互引导机制，成功解决了多模态分割中的模态不平衡问题，提升了模型在退化条件下的鲁棒性

Abstract: Multimodal semantic segmentation enhances model robustness by exploiting
cross-modal complementarities. However, existing methods often suffer from
imbalanced modal dependencies, where overall performance degrades significantly
once a dominant modality deteriorates in real-world scenarios. Thus, modality
balance has become acritical challenge for practical multimodal segmentation.
To address this issue, we propose EQUISeg, a multimodal segmentation framework
that balances modality contributions through equal encoding of modalities.
Built upon a four-stage Cross-modal Transformer Block(CMTB), EQUISeg enables
efficient multimodal fusion and hierarchical selection. Furthermore, we design
a Self-guided Module(SGM) that mitigates modality imbalance by introducing a
mutual guidance mechanism, enabling each modality to adaptively adjust its
contribution and enhance robustness under degraded conditions. Extensive
experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that EQUISeg achieves significant
performance gains and effectively alleviates the adverse effects of modality
imbalance in segmentation tasks.

Motivation: 标准CLIP文本编码器在复杂多目标场景中的图像编辑经常失败，需要解决目标数量、空间布局约束以及多样化类别的挑战。

Method: QL-Adapter包含两个核心模块：图像-布局融合模块（ILFM）将布局先验与CLIP图像编码器的ViT补丁标记融合以增强空间结构理解；跨模态增强模块（CMAM）将图像特征注入文本分支以丰富文本嵌入并改进指令跟随。

Conclusion: QL-Adapter通过融合布局先验和跨模态特征增强，有效解决了复杂多目标场景中的图像编辑挑战，为数量与布局一致的图像编辑提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Instruction driven image editing with standard CLIP text encoders often fails
in complex scenes with many objects. We present QL-Adapter, a framework for
multiple object editing that tackles two challenges: enforcing object counts
and spatial layouts, and accommodating diverse categories. QL-Adapter consists
of two core modules: the Image-Layout Fusion Module (ILFM) and the Cross-Modal
Augmentation Module (CMAM). ILFM fuses layout priors with ViT patch tokens from
the CLIP image encoder to strengthen spatial structure understanding. CMAM
injects image features into the text branch to enrich textual embeddings and
improve instruction following. We further build QL-Dataset, a benchmark that
spans broad category, layout, and count variations, and define the task of
quantity and layout consistent image editing (QL-Edit). Extensive experiments
show that QL-Adapter achieves state of the art performance on QL-Edit and
significantly outperforms existing models.

TL;DR: 提出了Consistency Mid-Training (CMT)方法，在预训练和流映射训练之间插入轻量级中间阶段，显著提高训练稳定性和效率，在多个数据集上达到最先进的2步生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的流映射模型如一致性模型和均值流模型虽然能实现少步生成，但训练不稳定、对超参数敏感且成本高昂。从预训练扩散模型初始化虽然有帮助，但仍需将无穷小步转换为长跳映射，稳定性问题未解决。

Method: 引入中间训练概念，在扩散预训练和最终流映射训练之间插入轻量级中间阶段。CMT训练模型将预训练模型求解器轨迹上的点直接映射到求解器生成的干净样本，产生轨迹一致且稳定的初始化。

Result: 在CIFAR-10上2步FID为1.97，ImageNet 64x64上为1.32，ImageNet 512x512上为1.84，比一致性模型节省高达98%的训练数据和GPU时间。在ImageNet 256x256上1步FID为3.34，总训练时间比从头训练的均值流减少约50%。

Conclusion: CMT为训练流映射模型提供了一个原则性、高效且通用的框架，实现了快速、稳健的收敛，无需启发式方法。

Abstract: Flow map models such as Consistency Models (CM) and Mean Flow (MF) enable
few-step generation by learning the long jump of the ODE solution of diffusion
models, yet training remains unstable, sensitive to hyperparameters, and
costly. Initializing from a pre-trained diffusion model helps, but still
requires converting infinitesimal steps into a long-jump map, leaving
instability unresolved. We introduce mid-training, the first concept and
practical method that inserts a lightweight intermediate stage between the
(diffusion) pre-training and the final flow map training (i.e., post-training)
for vision generation. Concretely, Consistency Mid-Training (CMT) is a compact
and principled stage that trains a model to map points along a solver
trajectory from a pre-trained model, starting from a prior sample, directly to
the solver-generated clean sample. It yields a trajectory-consistent and stable
initialization. This initializer outperforms random and diffusion-based
baselines and enables fast, robust convergence without heuristics. Initializing
post-training with CMT weights further simplifies flow map learning.
Empirically, CMT achieves state of the art two step FIDs: 1.97 on CIFAR-10,
1.32 on ImageNet 64x64, and 1.84 on ImageNet 512x512, while using up to 98%
less training data and GPU time, compared to CMs. On ImageNet 256x256, CMT
reaches 1-step FID 3.34 while cutting total training time by about 50% compared
to MF from scratch (FID 3.43). This establishes CMT as a principled, efficient,
and general framework for training flow map models.

Abstract: 3D scene understanding is fundamental for embodied AI and robotics,
supporting reliable perception for interaction and navigation. Recent
approaches achieve zero-shot, open-vocabulary 3D semantic mapping by assigning
embedding vectors to 2D class-agnostic masks generated via vision-language
models (VLMs) and projecting these into 3D. However, these methods often
produce fragmented masks and inaccurate semantic assignments due to the direct
use of raw masks, limiting their effectiveness in complex environments. To
address this, we leverage SemanticSAM with progressive granularity refinement
to generate more accurate and numerous object-level masks, mitigating the
over-segmentation commonly observed in mask generation models such as vanilla
SAM, and improving downstream 3D semantic segmentation. To further enhance
semantic context, we employ a context-aware CLIP encoding strategy that
integrates multiple contextual views of each mask using empirically determined
weighting, providing much richer visual context. We evaluate our approach on
multiple 3D scene understanding tasks, including 3D semantic segmentation and
object retrieval from language queries, across several benchmark datasets.
Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over existing
methods, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: Diffusion Bridge and Flow Matching have both demonstrated compelling
empirical performance in transformation between arbitrary distributions.
However, there remains confusion about which approach is generally preferable,
and the substantial discrepancies in their modeling assumptions and practical
implementations have hindered a unified theoretical account of their relative
merits. We have, for the first time, provided a unified theoretical and
experimental validation of these two models. We recast their frameworks through
the lens of Stochastic Optimal Control and prove that the cost function of the
Diffusion Bridge is lower, guiding the system toward more stable and natural
trajectories. Simultaneously, from the perspective of Optimal Transport,
interpolation coefficients $t$ and $1-t$ of Flow Matching become increasingly
ineffective when the training data size is reduced. To corroborate these
theoretical claims, we propose a novel, powerful architecture for Diffusion

TL;DR: 提出一种融合大气散射物理先验的雾天人群计数方法，通过物理机制与数据驱动的协同优化，解决雾天环境中的长距离目标模糊、局部特征退化等挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对雾天环境中人群计数的关键挑战：长距离目标模糊、局部特征退化和图像对比度衰减，需要开发能够适应复杂气象条件的鲁棒计数方法。

Method: 1) 引入可微分大气散射模型，采用透射率动态估计和散射参数自适应校准技术；2) 基于Kolmogorov-Arnold表示定理设计MSA-KAN，构建可学习边缘激活函数；3) 提出天气感知GCN，利用MSA-KAN提取的深度特征动态构建空间邻接矩阵。

Result: 在四个公共数据集上的实验表明，该方法在浓雾场景下相比主流算法将MAE指标降低了12.2%-27.5%。

Conclusion: 该方法通过物理机制与数据驱动的协同优化，有效提升了雾天环境下人群计数的准确性，为解决复杂气象条件下的视觉任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: Aiming at the key challenges of crowd counting in foggy environments, such as
long-range target blurring, local feature degradation, and image contrast
attenuation, this paper proposes a crowd-counting method with a physical a
priori of atmospheric scattering, which improves crowd counting accuracy under
complex meteorological conditions through the synergistic optimization of the
physical mechanism and data-driven.Specifically, first, the method introduces a
differentiable atmospheric scattering model and employs transmittance dynamic
estimation and scattering parameter adaptive calibration techniques to
accurately quantify the nonlinear attenuation laws of haze on targets with
different depths of field.Secondly, the MSA-KAN was designed based on the
Kolmogorov-Arnold Representation Theorem to construct a learnable edge
activation function. By integrating a multi-layer progressive architecture with
adaptive skip connections, it significantly enhances the model's nonlinear
representation capability in feature-degraded regions, effectively suppressing
feature confusion under fog interference.Finally, we further propose a
weather-aware GCN that dynamically constructs spatial adjacency matrices using
deep features extracted by MSA-KAN. Experiments on four public datasets
demonstrate that our method achieves a 12.2\%-27.5\% reduction in MAE metrics
compared to mainstream algorithms in dense fog scenarios.

*Zhifang Zhang,Qiqi Tao,Jiaqi Lv,Na Zhao,Lei Feng,Joey Tianyi Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TokenSwap是一种针对大型视觉语言模型(LVLMs)的新型后门攻击方法，通过扰乱模型对物体关系的理解而非固定目标内容，实现更隐蔽的攻击效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有后门攻击使用固定目标模式，容易被检测到，因为模型会记忆这些频繁模式并表现出过度自信。需要开发更隐蔽的攻击方法。

Method: 在训练时向选定样本注入视觉触发器，同时交换对应文本答案中关键标记的语法角色，并使用自适应标记加权损失强调交换标记的学习。

Result: 实验证明TokenSwap在多个基准测试和各种LVLM架构上实现了高攻击成功率，同时保持了优越的隐蔽性和隐蔽性。

Conclusion: TokenSwap通过关注LVLMs的组合理解能力，实现了比传统固定模式攻击更隐蔽的后门攻击，揭示了LVLMs在关系理解方面的安全脆弱性。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have achieved impressive performance
across a wide range of vision-language tasks, while they remain vulnerable to
backdoor attacks. Existing backdoor attacks on LVLMs aim to force the victim
model to generate a predefined target pattern, which is either inserted into or
replaces the original content. We find that these fixed-pattern attacks are
relatively easy to detect, because the attacked LVLM tends to memorize such
frequent patterns in the training dataset, thereby exhibiting overconfidence on
these targets given poisoned inputs. To address these limitations, we introduce
TokenSwap, a more evasive and stealthy backdoor attack that focuses on the
compositional understanding capabilities of LVLMs. Instead of enforcing a fixed
targeted content, TokenSwap subtly disrupts the understanding of object
relationships in text. Specifically, it causes the backdoored model to generate
outputs that mention the correct objects in the image but misrepresent their
relationships (i.e., bags-of-words behavior). During training, TokenSwap
injects a visual trigger into selected samples and simultaneously swaps the
grammatical roles of key tokens in the corresponding textual answers. However,
the poisoned samples exhibit only subtle differences from the original ones,
making it challenging for the model to learn the backdoor behavior. To address
this, TokenSwap employs an adaptive token-weighted loss that explicitly
emphasizes the learning of swapped tokens, such that the visual triggers and
bags-of-words behavior are associated. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
TokenSwap achieves high attack success rates while maintaining superior
evasiveness and stealthiness across multiple benchmarks and various LVLM
architectures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 构建联合人脸-颅骨可变形模型在远程诊断、手术规划等领域有巨大潜力，但受限于配对数据稀缺、配准精度不足以及临床应用探索有限，且颅面畸形患者常被忽视。

Method: 首先构建包含200多个样本的数据集，提出新颖的密集射线匹配配准方法确保拓扑一致性，然后建立3D双向人脸-颅骨可变形模型，通过共享系数空间实现形状推断，并建模组织厚度变化。

Conclusion: BFSM模型有效解决了人脸-颅骨建模的关键挑战，在医学应用中展现出巨大潜力，特别是对颅面畸形患者的包容性建模。

Abstract: Building a joint face-skull morphable model holds great potential for
applications such as remote diagnostics, surgical planning, medical education,
and physically based facial simulation. However, realizing this vision is
constrained by the scarcity of paired face-skull data, insufficient
registration accuracy, and limited exploration of reconstruction and clinical
applications. Moreover, individuals with craniofacial deformities are often
overlooked, resulting in underrepresentation and limited inclusivity. To
address these challenges, we first construct a dataset comprising over 200
samples, including both normal cases and rare craniofacial conditions. Each
case contains a CT-based skull, a CT-based face, and a high-fidelity textured
face scan. Secondly, we propose a novel dense ray matching registration method
that ensures topological consistency across face, skull, and their tissue
correspondences. Based on this, we introduce the 3D Bidirectional Face-Skull
Morphable Model (BFSM), which enables shape inference between the face and
skull through a shared coefficient space, while also modeling tissue thickness
variation to support one-to-many facial reconstructions from the same skull,
reflecting individual changes such as fat over time. Finally, we demonstrate
the potential of BFSM in medical applications, including 3D face-skull
reconstruction from a single image and surgical planning prediction. Extensive
experiments confirm the robustness and accuracy of our method. BFSM is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文系统评估了YOLOv11模型在血液细胞检测中的性能，创建了一个包含16,891张图像和298,850个标注细胞的大型数据集，发现YOLOv11 Medium变体在8:1:1数据分割下达到最佳平衡，mAP@0.5为0.934。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动外周血涂片分析劳动密集且主观，深度学习提供有前景的替代方案，但缺乏对YOLOv11等先进模型在精细PBS检测中的系统评估。

Method: 创建大型标注数据集（12个血细胞类别+红细胞类别），全面评估5个YOLOv11变体（Nano到XLarge），在两种数据分割策略（70:20:10和80:10:10）下使用mAP、精确率、召回率、F1分数和计算效率等多指标进行系统评估。

Result: YOLOv11 Medium变体在8:1:1分割下达到最佳平衡，mAP@0.5为0.934；更大模型仅带来边际精度提升但计算成本显著增加；8:1:1分割在所有模型中均优于7:2:1分割。

Conclusion: YOLOv11特别是Medium变体是自动化精细PBS检测的高效框架，公开数据集为血液学血细胞检测和分类研究提供了宝贵资源。

Abstract: Manual peripheral blood smear (PBS) analysis is labor intensive and
subjective. While deep learning offers a promising alternative, a systematic
evaluation of state of the art models such as YOLOv11 for fine grained PBS
detection is still lacking. In this work, we make two key contributions. First,
we curate a large scale annotated dataset for blood cell detection and
classification, comprising 16,891 images across 12 peripheral blood cell (PBC)
classes, along with the red blood cell class, all carefully re annotated for
object detection tasks. In total, the dataset contains 298,850 annotated cells.
Second, we leverage this dataset to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of five
YOLOv11 variants (ranging from Nano to XLarge). These models are rigorously
benchmarked under two data splitting strategies (70:20:10 and 80:10:10) and
systematically assessed using multiple performance criteria, including mean
Average Precision (mAP), precision, recall, F1 score, and computational
efficiency. Our experiments show that the YOLOv11 Medium variant achieves the
best trade off, reaching a mAP@0.5 of 0.934 under the 8:1:1 split. Larger
models (Large and XLarge) provide only marginal accuracy gains at substantially
higher computational cost. Moreover, the 8:1:1 split consistently outperforms
the 7:2:1 split across all models. These findings highlight YOLOv11,
particularly the Medium variant, as a highly effective framework for automated,
fine grained PBS detection. Beyond benchmarking, our publicly released dataset
(github.com/Mohamad-AbouAli/OI-PBC-Dataset) offers a valuable resource to
advance research on blood cell detection and classification in hematology.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于结构化最优传输的无人监督框架，用于精英标枪投掷动作的上下文感知时序分割，无需手动标注即可识别运动阶段转换。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统运动分析依赖手动标注或实验室设备，成本高且难以扩展。需要一种自动提取相关动力学变量的鲁棒方法。

Method: 将结构化最优传输(SOT)概念应用于注意力时空图卷积网络(ASTGCN)，实现上下文感知的时序分割。

Result: 在测试数据上达到71.02%的平均精度和74.61%的F1分数，显著优于现有无人监督方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为运动分析提供了一种有效的无人监督解决方案，并发布了包含211个专业标枪投掷视频的新数据集。

Abstract: Precise analysis of athletic motion is central to sports analytics,
particularly in disciplines where nuanced biomechanical phases directly impact
performance outcomes. Traditional analytics techniques rely on manual
annotation or laboratory-based instrumentation, which are time-consuming,
costly, and lack scalability. Automatic extraction of relevant kinetic
variables requires a robust and contextually appropriate temporal segmentation.
Considering the specific case of elite javelin-throw, we present a novel
unsupervised framework for such a contextually aware segmentation, which
applies the structured optimal transport (SOT) concept to augment the
well-known Attention-based Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network
(ASTGCN). This enables the identification of motion phase transitions without
requiring expensive manual labeling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
approach outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised methods, achieving 71.02%
mean average precision (mAP) and 74.61% F1-score on test data, substantially
higher than competing baselines. We also release a new dataset of 211 manually
annotated professional javelin-throw videos with frame-level annotations,
covering key biomechanical phases: approach steps, drive, throw, and recovery.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FreeRet是一个即插即用框架，可将任何多模态大语言模型转换为两阶段检索器，无需额外训练即可实现强大的检索性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型需要大量后训练才能转换为检索编码器，这限制了它们的通用性和应用范围。

Method: 采用两阶段检索：首先直接从模型获取语义嵌入进行快速候选搜索，然后利用模型的推理能力进行精确重排序。关键技术包括绕过词汇对齐层、使用显式先验条件生成表示、通过中性选择框架减轻重排序中的框架效应。

Result: 在MMEB和MMEB-V2基准测试的46个数据集上，FreeRet显著优于经过数百万对数据训练的模型，且具有模型无关性、可扩展性和多模态支持能力。

Conclusion: 预训练的多模态大语言模型经过精心利用后，无需训练即可作为强大的检索引擎，填补了其作为通用模型的关键空白。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are emerging as versatile
foundations for mixed-modality retrieval. Yet, they often require heavy
post-hoc training to convert them into contrastive encoders for retrieval. This
work asks: Can off-the-shelf MLLMs serve as powerful retrievers without
additional training? We present FreeRet, a plug-and-play framework that turns
any MLLM into a two-stage retriever. FreeRet first derives semantically
grounded embeddings directly from the model for fast candidate search, and then
exploits its reasoning ability for precise reranking. The framework contributes
three advances: bypassing lexical alignment layers to obtain semantically
faithful embeddings, conditioning representation generation with explicit
priors, and mitigating framing effect in reranking via neutral choice framing.
On the MMEB and MMEB-V2 benchmarks spanning 46 datasets, FreeRet substantially
outperforms models trained on millions of pairs. Beyond benchmarks, FreeRet is
model-agnostic and scales seamlessly across MLLM families and sizes, preserves
their generative abilities, supports arbitrary modality combinations, and
unifies retrieval, reranking, and generation into end-to-end RAG within a
single model. Our findings demonstrate that pretrained MLLMs, when carefully
harnessed, can serve as strong retrieval engines without training, closing a
critical gap in their role as generalists.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPLICE是一个基于COIN教学视频数据集的人类标注基准，用于评估多维度事件推理能力。该基准包含3,381个视频和11,423个事件片段，测试人类和视觉语言模型重新排列事件序列的能力。结果显示VLMs与人类表现存在显著差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在事件推理方面存在不足，需要构建专门基准来评估模型在时间、因果、空间、上下文和常识推理等多维度的能力。

Method: 从COIN数据集中筛选3,381个视频，涵盖12个类别和180个子类别，分割成11,423个事件片段。通过重新排列事件序列的任务评估人类和VLMs的表现，并分析文本标注对性能的影响。

Result: 人类表现显著优于VLMs。文本标注能提升模型准确率但不影响人类表现，表明模型更依赖语言先验而非视觉理解。VLMs在时间和因果推理主导的任务中表现相对较好，在专业任务中表现较差。

Conclusion: 视觉语言模型在视觉推理方面仍面临重大挑战，特别是在上下文和空间推理方面。模型过度依赖语言先验，需要更强的视觉理解能力。

Abstract: In this work, we introduce SPLICE, a human-curated benchmark derived from the
COIN instructional video dataset, designed to probe event-based reasoning
across multiple dimensions: temporal, causal, spatial, contextual, and general
knowledge. SPLICE includes 3,381 human-filtered videos spanning 12 categories
and 180 sub-categories, such as sports, engineering, and housework. These
videos are segmented into a total of 11,423 event clips. We evaluate both human
participants and state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) on the task of
rearranging these clips into coherent event sequences to assess visual
reasoning capabilities. Results reveal a significant gap: VLMs struggle to
match human performance. While human-annotated textual descriptions improve
model accuracy, they do not affect human performance, suggesting that models
rely more on language priors than on visual understanding. Even with
annotations, VLMs fall short of human-level reasoning, underscoring persistent
challenges in visual reasoning. A deeper analysis across sub-categories shows
that VLMs perform relatively better on videos where temporal and causal
reasoning are dominant, compared to those where contextual and spatial
reasoning are dominant. They also perform better on everyday tasks than on
specialized ones.

Motivation: 屏幕截图照片常受闪烁条纹影响，这种时间混叠现象严重影响可读性和感知质量，但现有研究较少关注此问题。

Method: 提出RIFLE框架：1) 闪烁条纹先验估计器预测条纹属性；2) 掩码损失专注条纹区域监督；3) 模拟管道合成训练数据；4) 收集真实世界数据集评估。

Result: 在真实世界数据集上，RIFLE在定量指标和视觉比较中均优于现有图像重建基线，从轻微到严重闪烁条纹都能有效去除。

Conclusion: 这是首个研究闪烁条纹模拟和去除的工作，为后续研究在数据集构建和去除模型设计方面奠定了良好基础。

Abstract: Capturing screens is now routine in our everyday lives. But the photographs
of emissive displays are often influenced by the flicker-banding (FB), which is
alternating bright%u2013dark stripes that arise from temporal aliasing between
a camera's rolling-shutter readout and the display's brightness modulation.
Unlike moire degradation, which has been extensively studied, the FB remains
underexplored despite its frequent and severe impact on readability and
perceived quality. We formulate FB removal as a dedicated restoration task and
introduce Removal of Image Flicker-Banding via Latent Diffusion Enhancement,
RIFLE, a diffusion-based framework designed to remove FB while preserving fine
details. We propose the flicker-banding prior estimator (FPE) that predicts key
banding attributes and injects it into the restoration network. Additionally,
Masked Loss (ML) is proposed to concentrate supervision on banded regions
without sacrificing global fidelity. To overcome data scarcity, we provide a
simulation pipeline that synthesizes FB in the luminance domain with stochastic
jitter in banding angle, banding spacing, and banding width. Feathered
boundaries and sensor noise are also applied for a more realistic simulation.
For evaluation, we collect a paired real-world FB dataset with pixel-aligned
banding-free references captured via long exposure. Across quantitative metrics
and visual comparisons on our real-world dataset, RIFLE consistently
outperforms recent image reconstruction baselines from mild to severe
flicker-banding. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first work to research
the simulation and removal of FB. Our work establishes a great foundation for
subsequent research in both the dataset construction and the removal model
design. Our dataset and code will be released soon.

Conclusion: 建立了一个通用且可扩展的面向对象生成建模方法，为创意、科学和实际领域的交互式、结构化、用户驱动的生成工具扩展了设计空间。

Abstract: A central goal in AI is to represent scenes as compositions of discrete
objects, enabling fine-grained, controllable image and video generation. Yet
leading diffusion models treat images holistically and rely on text
conditioning, creating a mismatch for object-level editing. This thesis
introduces a framework that adapts powerful pretrained diffusion models for
object-centric synthesis while retaining their generative capacity.
  We identify a core challenge: balancing global scene coherence with
disentangled object control. Our method integrates lightweight, slot-based
conditioning into pretrained models, preserving their visual priors while
providing object-specific manipulation. For images, SlotAdapt augments
diffusion models with a register token for background/style and
slot-conditioned modules for objects, reducing text-conditioning bias and
achieving state-of-the-art results in object discovery, segmentation,
compositional editing, and controllable image generation.
  We further extend the framework to video. Using Invariant Slot Attention
(ISA) to separate object identity from pose and a Transformer-based temporal
aggregator, our approach maintains consistent object representations and
dynamics across frames. This yields new benchmarks in unsupervised video object
segmentation and reconstruction, and supports advanced editing tasks such as
object removal, replacement, and insertion without explicit supervision.
  Overall, this work establishes a general and scalable approach to
object-centric generative modeling for images and videos. By bridging human
object-based perception and machine learning, it expands the design space for
interactive, structured, and user-driven generative tools in creative,
scientific, and practical domains.

Conclusion: 针对性的分类增强为推进伪装目标分割性能提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Open-vocabulary camouflaged object segmentation requires models to segment
camouflaged objects of arbitrary categories unseen during training, placing
extremely high demands on generalization capabilities. Through analysis of
existing methods, it is observed that the classification component
significantly affects overall segmentation performance. Accordingly, a
classifier-centric adaptive framework is proposed to enhance segmentation
performance by improving the classification component via a lightweight text
adapter with a novel layered asymmetric initialization. Through the
classification enhancement, the proposed method achieves substantial
improvements in segmentation metrics compared to the OVCoser baseline on the
OVCamo benchmark: cIoU increases from 0.443 to 0.493, cSm from 0.579 to 0.658,
and cMAE reduces from 0.336 to 0.239. These results demonstrate that targeted
classification enhancement provides an effective approach for advancing
camouflaged object segmentation performance.

Abstract: The identification and segmentation of moderate-severe traumatic brain injury
(TBI) lesions pose a significant challenge in neuroimaging. This difficulty
arises from the extreme heterogeneity of these lesions, which vary in size,
number, and laterality, thereby complicating downstream image processing tasks
such as image registration and brain parcellation, reducing the analytical
accuracy. Thus, developing methods for highly accurate segmentation of TBI
lesions is essential for reliable neuroimaging analysis. This study aims to
develop an effective automated segmentation pipeline to automatically detect
and segment TBI lesions in T1-weighted MRI scans. We evaluate multiple
approaches to achieve accurate segmentation of the TBI lesions. The core of our
pipeline leverages various architectures within the nnUNet framework for
initial segmentation, complemented by post-processing strategies to enhance
evaluation metrics. Our final submission to the challenge achieved an accuracy
of 0.8451, Dice score values of 0.4711 and 0.8514 for images with and without
visible lesions, respectively, with an overall Dice score of 0.5973, ranking
among the top-6 methods in the AIMS-TBI 2025 challenge. The Python

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SANA-Video是一个小型扩散模型，能够高效生成720x1280分辨率、长达一分钟的视频，在RTX 5090 GPU上部署，生成速度快且成本低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有视频生成模型计算成本高、生成速度慢的问题，实现低成本、高质量的长视频生成。

Method: 采用线性注意力机制（Linear DiT）和恒定内存KV缓存技术，结合有效的数据过滤和训练策略。

Result: 相比现有模型（如Wan 2.1-1.3B和SkyReel-V2-1.3B）性能相当但速度快16倍，训练成本仅为MovieGen的1%。

Conclusion: SANA-Video实现了低成本、高质量的视频生成，为实际部署提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce SANA-Video, a small diffusion model that can efficiently
generate videos up to 720x1280 resolution and minute-length duration.
SANA-Video synthesizes high-resolution, high-quality and long videos with
strong text-video alignment at a remarkably fast speed, deployable on RTX 5090
GPU. Two core designs ensure our efficient, effective and long video
generation: (1) Linear DiT: We leverage linear attention as the core operation,
which is more efficient than vanilla attention given the large number of tokens
processed in video generation. (2) Constant-Memory KV cache for Block Linear
Attention: we design block-wise autoregressive approach for long video
generation by employing a constant-memory state, derived from the cumulative
properties of linear attention. This KV cache provides the Linear DiT with
global context at a fixed memory cost, eliminating the need for a traditional
KV cache and enabling efficient, minute-long video generation. In addition, we
explore effective data filters and model training strategies, narrowing the
training cost to 12 days on 64 H100 GPUs, which is only 1% of the cost of
MovieGen. Given its low cost, SANA-Video achieves competitive performance
compared to modern state-of-the-art small diffusion models (e.g., Wan 2.1-1.3B
and SkyReel-V2-1.3B) while being 16x faster in measured latency. Moreover,
SANA-Video can be deployed on RTX 5090 GPUs with NVFP4 precision, accelerating
the inference speed of generating a 5-second 720p video from 71s to 29s (2.4x
speedup). In summary, SANA-Video enables low-cost, high-quality video
generation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练的视频生成框架，通过显式物理推理和同步解耦引导策略来提升生成视频的物理合理性，避免违反物理定律的虚假运动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型依赖大规模文本-视频数据集隐式学习物理推理，成本高、难以扩展，且容易产生违反基本物理定律的不合理运动。

Method: 采用轻量级物理感知推理管道构建反事实提示，提出同步解耦引导策略，包括同步方向归一化对抗滞后抑制和轨迹解耦去噪缓解累积轨迹偏差。

Result: 在不同物理领域的实验中，该方法显著提升了物理保真度，同时保持照片真实感，且无需额外训练。消融研究证实了物理感知推理组件和SDG策略的互补有效性。

Conclusion: 建立了一种新的即插即用物理感知视频生成范式，能够有效抑制不合理内容并提升物理合理性。

Abstract: Diffusion models can generate realistic videos, but existing methods rely on
implicitly learning physical reasoning from large-scale text-video datasets,
which is costly, difficult to scale, and still prone to producing implausible
motions that violate fundamental physical laws. We introduce a training-free
framework that improves physical plausibility at inference time by explicitly
reasoning about implausibility and guiding the generation away from it.
Specifically, we employ a lightweight physics-aware reasoning pipeline to
construct counterfactual prompts that deliberately encode physics-violating
behaviors. Then, we propose a novel Synchronized Decoupled Guidance (SDG)
strategy, which leverages these prompts through synchronized directional
normalization to counteract lagged suppression and trajectory-decoupled
denoising to mitigate cumulative trajectory bias, ensuring that implausible
content is suppressed immediately and consistently throughout denoising.
Experiments across different physical domains show that our approach
substantially enhances physical fidelity while maintaining photorealism,
despite requiring no additional training. Ablation studies confirm the
complementary effectiveness of both the physics-aware reasoning component and
SDG. In particular, the aforementioned two designs of SDG are also individually
validated to contribute critically to the suppression of implausible content
and the overall gains in physical plausibility. This establishes a new and
plug-and-play physics-aware paradigm for video generation.

TL;DR: 本文提出了IWR-Bench基准测试，用于评估大型视觉语言模型从视频中重建交互式网页的能力，包含113个真实网站任务，实验显示当前最佳模型仅得36.35%总分，功能正确性远落后于视觉保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要关注静态截图到代码的任务，忽略了真实网页应用中的动态交互特性，需要新的基准来评估模型处理交互式网页重建的能力。

Method: 构建包含113个任务、1001个动作的IWR-Bench基准，涵盖多样交互复杂度和视觉风格，使用代理即评判框架和综合指标系统自动评估生成网页的功能正确性和视觉保真度。

Result: 在28个LVLM上的实验显示，最佳模型总体得分仅36.35%，功能正确性(24.39% IFS)显著落后于视觉保真度(64.25% VFS)，表明当前模型在时序动态推理和事件驱动逻辑合成方面存在严重局限。

Conclusion: IWR-Bench为视觉语言研究设立了具有挑战性的前沿，揭示了当前模型在理解动态交互和生成功能代码方面的关键限制。

Abstract: The webpage-to-code task requires models to understand visual representations
of webpages and generate corresponding code. However, existing benchmarks
primarily focus on static screenshot-to-code tasks, thereby overlooking the
dynamic interactions fundamental to real-world web applications. To address
this limitation, this paper introduces IWR-Bench, a novel benchmark for
evaluating the capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) in
interactive webpage reconstruction from video. IWR-Bench comprises 113
meticulously curated tasks from 100 real-world websites, with 1,001 actions and
featuring diverse interaction complexities (e.g., web games), visual styles,
and domains. Aligning with standard web development practices, each task
includes not only user interaction videos but also all crawled static assets
(e.g., images, videos). This benchmark evaluates models on two fundamental
challenges: comprehensive multi-modal reasoning to infer interaction logic from
video and assets, and advanced code generation to translate this logic into
functional code. An agent-as-a-judge framework with a comprehensive metric
system automatically assesses the functional correctness and visual fidelity of
generated webpages. Extensive experiments on 28 LVLMs reveal a significant
challenge: the best model achieves an overall score of only 36.35%, as
functional correctness (24.39% IFS) lags significantly behind visual fidelity
(64.25% VFS). These results highlight critical limitations in current models'
ability to reason about temporal dynamics and synthesize event-driven logic,
establishing IWR-Bench as a challenging frontier for vision-language research.
The benchmark and evaluation code will be made publicly available. Code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有医学视觉语言模型在影像模态多样性和多语言临床数据方面的局限性，特别是PET/CT数据和越南语的缺乏。

Method: 构建越南语多模态医学数据集，并引入包含数据增强和专家验证测试集的训练框架。

Result: 实验表明，使用该数据集显著提升了现有VLMs在医学报告生成和视觉问答等下游任务上的性能。

Conclusion: 该数据集和基准测试将推动医学影像领域更鲁棒的视觉语言模型发展，特别是在低资源语言环境中，提升越南医疗的临床相关性。

Abstract: Vision-Language Foundation Models (VLMs), trained on large-scale multimodal
datasets, have driven significant advances in Artificial Intelligence by
enabling rich cross-modal reasoning. Despite their success in general domains,
applying these models to medical imaging remains challenging due to the limited
availability of diverse imaging modalities and multilingual clinical data. Most
existing medical VLMs are trained on a subset of imaging modalities and focus
primarily on high-resource languages, thus limiting their generalizability and
clinical utility. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel
Vietnamese-language multimodal medical dataset comprising 1,567,062 paired
CT-PET images and corresponding 2,757 full-length clinical reports. This
dataset is designed to fill two pressing gaps in medical AI development: (1)
the lack of PET/CT imaging data in existing VLMs training corpora, which
hinders the development of models capable of handling functional imaging tasks;
and (2) the underrepresentation of low-resource languages, particularly the
Vietnamese language, in medical vision-language research. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first dataset to provide comprehensive PET/CT-report
pairs in Vietnamese. We further introduce a training framework to enhance VLMs'
learning, including data augmentation and expert-validated test sets. We
conduct comprehensive experiments benchmarking state-of-the-art VLMs on
downstream tasks, including medical report generation and visual question
answering. The experimental results show that incorporating our dataset
significantly improves the performance of existing VLMs. We believe this
dataset and benchmark will serve as a pivotal step in advancing the development
of more robust VLMs for medical imaging, particularly in low-resource
languages, and improving their clinical relevance in Vietnamese healthcare.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有双模态跟踪方法在复杂场景中因输入模态有限而面临挑战，需要更多互补模态来增强鲁棒性。

Method: 提出RDTTrack跟踪器，利用预训练的RGB跟踪模型和提示学习技术，在正交投影约束下融合热红外和深度模态，然后与RGB信号集成作为提示。

Result: 实验结果表明该方法在复杂场景中的跟踪精度和鲁棒性方面显著优于现有双模态方法。

Conclusion: 三模态跟踪通过互补信息融合能够有效提升复杂场景下的跟踪性能，RGBDT500数据集和RDTTrack方法为多模态跟踪研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Existing multi-modal object tracking approaches primarily focus on dual-modal
paradigms, such as RGB-Depth or RGB-Thermal, yet remain challenged in complex
scenarios due to limited input modalities. To address this gap, this work
introduces a novel multi-modal tracking task that leverages three complementary
modalities, including visible RGB, Depth (D), and Thermal Infrared (TIR),
aiming to enhance robustness in complex scenarios. To support this task, we
construct a new multi-modal tracking dataset, coined RGBDT500, which consists
of 500 videos with synchronised frames across the three modalities. Each frame
provides spatially aligned RGB, depth, and thermal infrared images with precise
object bounding box annotations. Furthermore, we propose a novel multi-modal
tracker, dubbed RDTTrack. RDTTrack integrates tri-modal information for robust
tracking by leveraging a pretrained RGB-only tracking model and prompt learning
techniques. In specific, RDTTrack fuses thermal infrared and depth modalities
under a proposed orthogonal projection constraint, then integrates them with
RGB signals as prompts for the pre-trained foundation tracking model,
effectively harmonising tri-modal complementary cues. The experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed method, showing
significant improvements over existing dual-modal approaches in terms of
tracking accuracy and robustness in complex scenarios.

TL;DR: ExGS是一个前馈框架，通过统一通用高斯压缩(UGC)和GaussPainter实现极端3D高斯溅射压缩，能在100倍压缩下保持渲染质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经场景表示(如3DGS)存储和传输成本高，现有压缩方法要么优化成本高，要么在高压缩比下质量下降，需要数据驱动方法克服这种权衡。

Method: UGC进行无重优化剪枝减少高斯基元，GaussPainter利用扩散先验和掩码引导细化从严重剪枝的高斯场景恢复高质量渲染，采用轻量VAE和一步扩散设计实现实时恢复。

Result: 实现超过100倍压缩(从354.77MB到3.31MB)，在挑战性条件下保持保真度并显著提升图像质量。

Conclusion: 扩散先验在弥合极端压缩和高质量神经渲染之间的差距中发挥核心作用。

Abstract: Neural scene representations, such as 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), have
enabled high-quality neural rendering; however, their large storage and
transmission costs hinder deployment in resource-constrained environments.
Existing compression methods either rely on costly optimization, which is slow
and scene-specific, or adopt training-free pruning and quantization, which
degrade rendering quality under high compression ratios. In contrast, recent
data-driven approaches provide a promising direction to overcome this
trade-off, enabling efficient compression while preserving high rendering
quality. We introduce \textbf{ExGS}, a novel feed-forward framework that
unifies \textbf{Universal Gaussian Compression} (UGC) with
\textbf{GaussPainter} for \textbf{Ex}treme 3D\textbf{GS} compression.
\textbf{UGC} performs re-optimization-free pruning to aggressively reduce
Gaussian primitives while retaining only essential information, whereas
\textbf{GaussPainter} leverages powerful diffusion priors with mask-guided
refinement to restore high-quality renderings from heavily pruned Gaussian
scenes. Unlike conventional inpainting, GaussPainter not only fills in missing
regions but also enhances visible pixels, yielding substantial improvements in
degraded renderings. To ensure practicality, it adopts a lightweight VAE and a
one-step diffusion design, enabling real-time restoration. Our framework can
even achieve over $100\times$ compression (reducing a typical 354.77 MB model
to about 3.31 MB) while preserving fidelity and significantly improving image
quality under challenging conditions. These results highlight the central role
of diffusion priors in bridging the gap between extreme compression and
high-quality neural rendering. Our code repository will be released at
\href{https://github.com/chenttt2001/ExGS}{here}.

Conclusion: VTPerception-R1为基于感知的多模态推理提供了可扩展且可审计的解决方案，其中显式感知与文本线索结合效果最佳。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) often struggle to ground reasoning
in perceptual evidence. We present a systematic study of perception
strategies-explicit, implicit, visual, and textual-across four multimodal
benchmarks and two MLLMs. Our findings show that explicit perception,
especially when paired with textual cues, consistently yields the best
improvements, particularly for smaller models. Based on this insight, we
propose VTPerception-R1, a unified two-stage framework that decouples
perception from reasoning. Stage 1 introduces perception-augmented fine-tuning,
and Stage 2 applies perception-aware reinforcement learning with novel visual,
textual, and consistency rewards. Experiments demonstrate that VTPerception-R1
significantly improves reasoning accuracy and robustness across diverse tasks,
offering a scalable and auditable solution for perception-grounded multimodal

Conclusion: SkyLink方法通过缓解视角遮挡、确保特征一致性和利用3D场景信息，有效解决了跨视角地理定位中的语义退化问题。

Abstract: Cross-view geo-localization aims at establishing location correspondences
between different viewpoints. Existing approaches typically learn cross-view
correlations through direct feature similarity matching, often overlooking
semantic degradation caused by extreme viewpoint disparities. To address this
unique problem, we focus on robust feature retrieval under viewpoint variation
and propose the novel SkyLink method. We firstly utilize the Google Retrieval
Enhancement Module to perform data enhancement on street images, which
mitigates the occlusion of the key target due to restricted street viewpoints.
The Patch-Aware Feature Aggregation module is further adopted to emphasize
multiple local feature aggregations to ensure the consistent feature extraction
across viewpoints. Meanwhile, we integrate the 3D scene information constructed
from multi-scale UAV images as a bridge between street and satellite
viewpoints, and perform feature alignment through self-supervised and
cross-view contrastive learning. Experimental results demonstrate robustness
and generalization across diverse urban scenarios, which achieve 25.75$\%$

Motivation: 解决大型视频语言模型在长视频理解中面临的时空感知冲突问题，即均匀帧采样机制无法同时兼顾时间线索和空间细节

Method: 提出自适应缩放机制：先提供低分辨率密集采样帧，需要时基于推理放大感兴趣片段；使用多步推理实现，通过38k高质量CoT数据微调和解耦强化微调训练推理能力

Result: 在4个常见长视频理解基准上，LOVE-R1比基线Qwen2.5-VL平均提升3.1个百分点，实现了采样密度和帧分辨率之间的良好平衡

Conclusion: 慢快自适应帧采样机制能有效平衡长视频理解中的时空需求，多步推理和过程监督是提升模型性能的关键

Abstract: Long video understanding is still challenging for recent Large Video-Language
Models (LVLMs) due to the conflict between long-form temporal understanding and
detailed spatial perception. LVLMs with a uniform frame sampling mechanism,
which samples frames with an equal frame size and fixed sampling rate,
inevitably sacrifice either temporal clues or spatial details, resulting in
suboptimal solutions. To mitigate this dilemma, we propose LOVE-R1, a model
that can adaptively zoom in on a video clip. The model is first provided with
densely sampled frames but in a small resolution. If some spatial details are
needed, the model can zoom in on a clip of interest with a large frame
resolution based on its reasoning until key visual information is obtained. The
whole process is implemented as a multi-step reasoning process. To train the
reasoning ability, we first finetune the model on our collected 38k
high-quality CoT data and enhance it with decoupled reinforcement finetuning.
As outcome rewards can not provide fine-grained process supervision, we
decouple multi-step reasoning into multiple single-step reasoning and optimize
the internal zoom-in ability explicitly. Experiments on long video
understanding benchmarks show that our model with the slow-fast adaptive frame
sampling mechanism achieves a great trade-off between sampling density and
frame resolutions, and LOVE-R1 outperforms our baseline Qwen2.5-VL by an
average of 3.1% points across 4 common long video understanding benchmarks.

Conclusion: 该研究深化了对MLLM视觉处理机制的理解，促进了更高效、可解释和鲁棒模型的发展。

Abstract: This study identifies that visual-related functional decoding is distributed
across different decoder layers in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs).
Typically, each function, such as counting, grounding, or OCR recognition,
narrows down to two or three layers, which we define as Vision Function Layers
(VFL). Additionally, the depth and its order of different VFLs exhibits a
consistent pattern across different MLLMs, which is well-aligned with human
behaviors (e.g., recognition occurs first, followed by counting, and then
grounding). These findings are derived from Visual Token Swapping, our novel
analytical framework that modifies targeted KV cache entries to precisely
elucidate layer-specific functions during decoding. Furthermore, these insights
offer substantial utility in tailoring MLLMs for real-world downstream
applications. For instance, when LoRA training is selectively applied to VFLs
whose functions align with the training data, VFL-LoRA not only outperform
full-LoRA but also prevent out-of-domain function forgetting. Moreover, by
analyzing the performance differential on training data when particular VFLs
are ablated, VFL-select automatically classifies data by function, enabling
highly efficient data selection to directly bolster corresponding capabilities.
Consequently, VFL-select surpasses human experts in data selection, and
achieves 98% of full-data performance with only 20% of the original dataset.
This study delivers deeper comprehension of MLLM visual processing, fostering
the creation of more efficient, interpretable, and robust models.

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上达到最先进性能，Pendulum数据集上MAE减少91%，ADNI数据集上FID减少87%。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了鲁棒、可泛化的反事实编辑，具有忠实的属性修改和强大的身份保持能力。

Abstract: We present Causal-Adapter, a modular framework that adapts frozen
text-to-image diffusion backbones for counterfactual image generation. Our
method enables causal interventions on target attributes, consistently
propagating their effects to causal dependents without altering the core
identity of the image. In contrast to prior approaches that rely on prompt
engineering without explicit causal structure, Causal-Adapter leverages
structural causal modeling augmented with two attribute regularization
strategies: prompt-aligned injection, which aligns causal attributes with
textual embeddings for precise semantic control, and a conditioned token
contrastive loss to disentangle attribute factors and reduce spurious
correlations. Causal-Adapter achieves state-of-the-art performance on both
synthetic and real-world datasets, with up to 91\% MAE reduction on Pendulum
for accurate attribute control and 87\% FID reduction on ADNI for high-fidelity
MRI image generation. These results show that our approach enables robust,
generalizable counterfactual editing with faithful attribute modification and
strong identity preservation.

Conclusion: TACO-Net通过结合拓扑特征和轻量级网络架构，为3D物体分类提供了新的最先进解决方案

Abstract: 3D object classification is a crucial problem due to its significant
practical relevance in many fields, including computer vision, robotics, and
autonomous driving. Although deep learning methods applied to point clouds
sampled on CAD models of the objects and/or captured by LiDAR or RGBD cameras
have achieved remarkable success in recent years, achieving high classification
accuracy remains a challenging problem due to the unordered point clouds and
their irregularity and noise. To this end, we propose a novel state-of-the-art
(SOTA) 3D object classification technique that combines topological data
analysis with various image filtration techniques to classify objects when they
are represented using point clouds. We transform every point cloud into a
voxelized binary 3D image to extract distinguishing topological features. Next,
we train a lightweight one-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (1D CNN)
using the extracted feature set from the training dataset. Our framework,
TACO-Net, sets a new state-of-the-art by achieving $99.05\%$ and $99.52\%$
accuracy on the widely used synthetic benchmarks ModelNet40 and ModelNet10, and
further demonstrates its robustness on the large-scale real-world OmniObject3D
dataset. When tested with ten different kinds of corrupted ModelNet40 inputs,
the proposed TACO-Net demonstrates strong resiliency overall.

*Zeyu Cai,Ziyang Li,Xiaoben Li,Boqian Li,Zeyu Wang,Zhenyu Zhang,Yuliang Xiu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UP2You是首个无需调参的解决方案，能够从极其不受约束的野外2D照片中重建高保真3D着装人像，支持任意姿态控制和免训练的多服装3D虚拟试穿。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法需要"干净"的输入（如全身图像、最小遮挡或良好校准的跨视角捕捉），而UP2You旨在直接处理原始、非结构化的照片，这些照片在姿态、视角、裁剪和遮挡方面可能有显著差异。

Method: 引入数据校正器范式，通过单次前向传播在几秒内将不受约束的输入转换为干净的正交多视角图像；核心是姿态相关特征聚合模块（PCFA），选择性融合多参考图像信息；以及基于感知器的多参考形状预测器，无需预捕获的身体模板。

Result: 在4D-Dress、PuzzleIOI和野外捕捉数据集上的广泛实验表明，UP2You在几何精度（Chamfer-15%、P2S-18%）和纹理保真度（PSNR-21%、LPIPS-46%）方面均优于先前方法，效率高（1.5分钟/人）。

Conclusion: UP2You高效、多功能，适用于人类被随意捕捉的真实世界场景，为这一未充分探索的任务的未来研究提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: We present UP2You, the first tuning-free solution for reconstructing
high-fidelity 3D clothed portraits from extremely unconstrained in-the-wild 2D
photos. Unlike previous approaches that require "clean" inputs (e.g., full-body
images with minimal occlusions, or well-calibrated cross-view captures), UP2You
directly processes raw, unstructured photographs, which may vary significantly
in pose, viewpoint, cropping, and occlusion. Instead of compressing data into
tokens for slow online text-to-3D optimization, we introduce a data rectifier
paradigm that efficiently converts unconstrained inputs into clean, orthogonal
multi-view images in a single forward pass within seconds, simplifying the 3D
reconstruction. Central to UP2You is a pose-correlated feature aggregation
module (PCFA), that selectively fuses information from multiple reference
images w.r.t. target poses, enabling better identity preservation and nearly
constant memory footprint, with more observations. We also introduce a
perceiver-based multi-reference shape predictor, removing the need for
pre-captured body templates. Extensive experiments on 4D-Dress, PuzzleIOI, and
in-the-wild captures demonstrate that UP2You consistently surpasses previous
methods in both geometric accuracy (Chamfer-15%, P2S-18% on PuzzleIOI) and
texture fidelity (PSNR-21%, LPIPS-46% on 4D-Dress). UP2You is efficient (1.5
minutes per person), and versatile (supports arbitrary pose control, and
training-free multi-garment 3D virtual try-on), making it practical for
real-world scenarios where humans are casually captured. Both models and code
will be released to facilitate future research on this underexplored task.

*Youngeun Kim,Youjia Zhang,Huiling Liu,Aecheon Jung,Sunwoo Lee,Sungeun Hong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练的大视觉语言模型token剪枝框架，通过零阶扰动估计token敏感性，选择互补的视觉token，显著提升推理效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有token剪枝方法存在局限性：基于注意力的方法依赖不稳定的注意力分数，导致冗余选择；基于多样性的方法可能丢弃预测所需的关键区域

Method: 在投影层使用零阶扰动估计token敏感性，通过轻量前向传播测量小随机扰动对投影输出的影响，选择高敏感性且互补的视觉token

Result: 在多个VLM和基准测试中表现优异，最多剪枝94.4%的token同时保持准确性，端到端推理速度提升最高达2.30倍

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种高效、无需训练的token剪枝解决方案，显著提升大视觉语言模型的推理效率

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) enable strong multimodal reasoning but
incur heavy inference costs from redundant visual tokens. Token pruning
alleviates this issue, yet existing approaches face limitations.
Attention-based methods rely on raw attention scores, which are often unstable
across layers and heads and can lead to redundant selections. Diversity-based
methods improve robustness by selecting tokens far apart in feature space but
risk dropping regions needed for accurate prediction. We propose \ours, a
training-free framework built on a simple intuition: tokens with higher
sensitivity are more likely to influence the model's output, and they should
also capture complementary visual cues rather than overlapping information. To
achieve this, we estimate token sensitivity using zeroth-order perturbations at
the projection layer, a shallow and computationally light component of the
model. This approach measures how small random perturbations affect the
projection outputs, allowing us to approximate each token's influence through
lightweight forward passes without backpropagation. Extensive experiments
across multiple VLMs and benchmarks show that \ours consistently outperforms
prior methods, pruning up to 94.4\% of tokens while maintaining accuracy and
significantly improving efficiency, achieving up to 2.30x faster end-to-end
inference over the baseline.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出PHASE-Net，一种基于物理学的rPPG测量方法，通过Navier-Stokes方程推导出脉搏信号遵循二阶动态系统，使用轻量级TCN网络实现高效准确的非接触式生理监测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有rPPG方法在头部运动和光照变化下精度下降，且深度学习方法缺乏理论依据，限制了鲁棒性和可解释性。

Method: 基于血流动力学Navier-Stokes方程推导理论框架，设计PHASE-Net模型，包含零FLOPs轴向交换器、自适应空间滤波器和门控TCN三个关键组件。

Result: PHASE-Net在广泛实验中达到最先进性能，具有强效率和部署就绪性。

Conclusion: 提供了一种理论依据充分且实用的rPPG解决方案，通过物理学指导的深度学习框架实现了鲁棒的非接触生理监测。

Abstract: Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) measurement enables non-contact
physiological monitoring but suffers from accuracy degradation under head
motion and illumination changes. Existing deep learning methods are mostly
heuristic and lack theoretical grounding, which limits robustness and
interpretability. In this work, we propose a physics-informed rPPG paradigm
derived from the Navier-Stokes equations of hemodynamics, showing that the
pulse signal follows a second-order dynamical system whose discrete solution
naturally leads to a causal convolution. This provides a theoretical
justification for using a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN). Based on this
principle, we design PHASE-Net, a lightweight model with three key components:
(1) Zero-FLOPs Axial Swapper module, which swaps or transposes a few spatial
channels to mix distant facial regions and enhance cross-region feature
interaction without breaking temporal order; (2) Adaptive Spatial Filter, which
learns a soft spatial mask per frame to highlight signal-rich areas and
suppress noise; and (3) Gated TCN, a causal dilated TCN with gating that models
long-range temporal dynamics for accurate pulse recovery. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that PHASE-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance with strong
efficiency, offering a theoretically grounded and deployment-ready rPPG
solution.

*Jingru Qiu,Jiale Liang,Xuanhan Fan,Mingda Zhang,Zhenli He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ELPG-DTFS是一种基于脑电图（EEG）的抑郁症诊断方法，通过引入通道-频带注意力、可学习邻接矩阵和残差知识图路径，显著提升了诊断准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前抑郁症诊断主要依赖主观量表，而脑电图提供了低成本生物标志物。但现有深度学习方法将频谱视为静态图像，固定通道间图结构，忽略先验知识，限制了准确性和可解释性。

Method: 提出ELPG-DTFS框架，包含：(1) 基于跨频带互信息的通道-频带注意力机制；(2) 可学习邻接矩阵实现动态功能连接；(3) 残差知识图路径注入神经科学先验知识。

Result: 在128通道MODMA数据集（53名受试者）上，ELPG-DTFS达到97.63%准确率和97.33% F1分数，超越了2025年最先进的ACM-GNN方法。消融实验显示移除任何模块都会使F1分数下降高达4.35。

Conclusion: ELPG-DTFS为下一代基于脑电图的抑郁症诊断提供了一个稳健且可解释的框架，各模块具有互补价值。

Abstract: Timely and objective screening of major depressive disorder (MDD) is vital,
yet diagnosis still relies on subjective scales. Electroencephalography (EEG)
provides a low-cost biomarker, but existing deep models treat spectra as static
images, fix inter-channel graphs, and ignore prior knowledge, limiting accuracy
and interpretability. We propose ELPG-DTFS, a prior-guided adaptive
time-frequency graph neural network that introduces: (1) channel-band attention
with cross-band mutual information, (2) a learnable adjacency matrix for
dynamic functional links, and (3) a residual knowledge-graph pathway injecting
neuroscience priors. On the 128-channel MODMA dataset (53 subjects), ELPG-DTFS
achieves 97.63% accuracy and 97.33% F1, surpassing the 2025 state-of-the-art
ACM-GNN. Ablation shows that removing any module lowers F1 by up to 4.35,
confirming their complementary value. ELPG-DTFS thus offers a robust and
interpretable framework for next-generation EEG-based MDD diagnostics.

TL;DR: 受人类视觉系统启发，通过DoG滤波预处理增强图像对比度，在不改变模型架构的情况下提升语义分割在恶劣条件下的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受人类视觉系统的对比度增强和颜色对立机制启发，探索生物启发的输入预处理方法，以提升语义分割模型在恶劣环境下的鲁棒性。

Method: 在RGB、灰度图和对手颜色通道上应用高斯差分(DoG)滤波来增强局部对比度，这种预处理方法轻量且模型无关。

Result: 在Cityscapes、ACDC和Dark Zurich数据集上的评估表明，该方法在保持分布内性能的同时，显著提升了在夜间、雾天和雪天等恶劣条件下的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 这种模型无关的轻量级预处理方法有潜力集成到成像流水线中，为安全关键环境下的下游视觉模型提供任务就绪的鲁棒输入。

Abstract: Inspired by the human visual system's mechanisms for contrast enhancement and
color-opponency, we explore biologically motivated input preprocessing for
robust semantic segmentation. By applying Difference-of-Gaussians (DoG)
filtering to RGB, grayscale, and opponent-color channels, we enhance local
contrast without modifying model architecture or training. Evaluations on
Cityscapes, ACDC, and Dark Zurich show that such preprocessing maintains
in-distribution performance while improving robustness to adverse conditions
like night, fog, and snow. As this processing is model-agnostic and
lightweight, it holds potential for integration into imaging pipelines,
enabling imaging systems to deliver task-ready, robust inputs for downstream
vision models in safety-critical environments.

TL;DR: StreamForest是一个专为流媒体视频理解设计的新型架构，通过持久事件记忆森林和细粒度时空窗口解决实时推理问题，在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多模态大语言模型在实时流媒体场景中的局限性，包括历史视觉特征存储限制和实时时空推理不足的问题。

Method: 提出持久事件记忆森林机制，基于时间距离、内容相似度和合并频率的惩罚函数自适应组织视频帧；引入细粒度时空窗口捕获短期视觉线索；创建OnlineIT指令调优数据集。

Result: 在StreamingBench上达到77.3%准确率，OVBench上60.5%，OVO-Bench上55.6%；在极端视觉token压缩（1024 token）下仍保持96.8%的平均准确率。

Conclusion: StreamForest在流媒体视频理解中展现出强大的鲁棒性、高效性和泛化能力，为实时视频分析提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have recently achieved remarkable
progress in video understanding. However, their effectiveness in real-time
streaming scenarios remains limited due to storage constraints of historical
visual features and insufficient real-time spatiotemporal reasoning. To address
these challenges, we propose StreamForest, a novel architecture specifically
designed for streaming video understanding. Central to StreamForest is the
Persistent Event Memory Forest, a memory mechanism that adaptively organizes
video frames into multiple event-level tree structures. This process is guided
by penalty functions based on temporal distance, content similarity, and merge
frequency, enabling efficient long-term memory retention under limited
computational resources. To enhance real-time perception, we introduce a
Fine-grained Spatiotemporal Window, which captures detailed short-term visual
cues to improve current scene perception. Additionally, we present OnlineIT, an
instruction-tuning dataset tailored for streaming video tasks. OnlineIT
significantly boosts MLLM performance in both real-time perception and future
prediction. To evaluate generalization in practical applications, we introduce
ODV-Bench, a new benchmark focused on real-time streaming video understanding
in autonomous driving scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that
StreamForest achieves the state-of-the-art performance, with accuracies of
77.3% on StreamingBench, 60.5% on OVBench, and 55.6% on OVO-Bench. In
particular, even under extreme visual token compression (limited to 1024
tokens), the model retains 96.8% of its average accuracy in eight benchmarks
relative to the default setting. These results underscore the robustness,
efficiency, and generalizability of StreamForest for streaming video
understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于环境上下文条件的新型扩散模型，能够通过文本、元数据和视觉数据三种控制信号的任意组合生成卫星图像，解决了现有方法在环境上下文有限、数据缺失和用户意图反映不足等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型在遥感领域应用面临环境上下文有限、数据缺失或损坏、用户意图反映不可靠等显著局限性，需要开发能够更好利用多模态信息并可靠反映用户意图的生成方法。

Method: 提出环境上下文条件的扩散模型，首次将动态环境条件作为控制信号，采用元数据融合策略建模属性嵌入交互以处理部分损坏或缺失的观测数据，支持文本、元数据和视觉数据三种控制信号的任意组合。

Result: 在单图像和时间序列生成试验中，该方法在定性和定量评估上均优于先前方法，表现出对缺失元数据的鲁棒性、对控制输入更高的响应性，以及在6个不同指标上测量的更高保真度、准确性和生成质量。

Conclusion: 环境上下文条件化能够提高卫星图像基础模型的性能，所提出的模型在下游任务应用中具有良好前景，同时构建了首个公开可用的三模态数据集。

Abstract: Diffusion-based foundation models have recently garnered much attention in
the field of generative modeling due to their ability to generate images of
high quality and fidelity. Although not straightforward, their recent
application to the field of remote sensing signaled the first successful trials
towards harnessing the large volume of publicly available datasets containing
multimodal information. Despite their success, existing methods face
considerable limitations: they rely on limited environmental context, struggle
with missing or corrupted data, and often fail to reliably reflect user
intentions in generated outputs. In this work, we propose a novel diffusion
model conditioned on environmental context, that is able to generate satellite
images by conditioning from any combination of three different control signals:
a) text, b) metadata, and c) visual data. In contrast to previous works, the
proposed method is i) to our knowledge, the first of its kind to condition
satellite image generation on dynamic environmental conditions as part of its
control signals, and ii) incorporating a metadata fusion strategy that models
attribute embedding interactions to account for partially corrupt and/or
missing observations. Our method outperforms previous methods both
qualitatively (robustness to missing metadata, higher responsiveness to control
inputs) and quantitatively (higher fidelity, accuracy, and quality of
generations measured using 6 different metrics) in the trials of single-image
and temporal generation. The reported results support our hypothesis that
conditioning on environmental context can improve the performance of foundation
models for satellite imagery, and render our model a promising candidate for
usage in downstream tasks. The collected 3-modal dataset is to our knowledge,
the first publicly-available dataset to combine data from these three different
mediums.

TL;DR: 该论文针对车辆类型识别中的类别不平衡问题，通过合并多个数据集创建16类语料库，并采用SMOTE过采样和欠采样方法构建平衡变体。比较了轻量级集成方法和可配置CNN模型，发现CNN在测试集上表现最佳，但最少数类仍存在识别困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 公共数据集中严重的类别不平衡问题抑制了稀有类别车辆类型的识别性能，这影响了智能交通和物流系统的准确性。

Method: 合并Kaggle、ImageNet和网络爬取数据构建16类语料库（约47k图像），通过SMOTE过采样和针对性欠采样创建6个平衡变体。比较了基于MobileNet-V2特征的轻量级集成方法（随机森林、AdaBoost、软投票组合器）与可配置ResNet风格CNN（使用强数据增强和标签平滑训练）。

Result: 最佳集成方法（SMOTE组合）达到74.8%测试准确率，而CNN在全测试集上达到79.19%，在未见推理批次上达到81.25%。但最少数类（驳船）仍然是失败模式。

Conclusion: 深度模型具有优势，但仅靠重平衡方法无法解决最少数类的识别问题。建议优先收集更多少数类数据、使用成本敏感目标（如焦点损失），并探索混合集成或CNN管道以结合可解释性和表示能力。

Abstract: Accurate vehicle type recognition underpins intelligent transportation and
logistics, but severe class imbalance in public datasets suppresses performance
on rare categories. We curate a 16-class corpus (~47k images) by merging
Kaggle, ImageNet, and web-crawled data, and create six balanced variants via
SMOTE oversampling and targeted undersampling. Lightweight ensembles, such as
Random Forest, AdaBoost, and a soft-voting combiner built on MobileNet-V2
features are benchmarked against a configurable ResNet-style CNN trained with
strong augmentation and label smoothing. The best ensemble (SMOTE-combined)
attains 74.8% test accuracy, while the CNN achieves 79.19% on the full test set
and 81.25% on an unseen inference batch, confirming the advantage of deep
models. Nonetheless, the most under-represented class (Barge) remains a failure
mode, highlighting the limits of rebalancing alone. Results suggest
prioritizing additional minority-class collection and cost-sensitive objectives
(e.g., focal loss) and exploring hybrid ensemble or CNN pipelines to combine
interpretability with representational power.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MRI质量评估方法存在根本性权衡：基于信号的方法缺乏语义理解，而深度学习方法牺牲了可解释性。需要一种能结合定量分析和语义推理的解决方案。

Method: 结合三个关键创新：通过MRQy增强模拟伪影的鲁棒指标提取、使用Qwen将指标转化为问答对的结构化转换、通过LLaVA-OneVision的LoRA实现参数高效融合。

Result: 在MR-ART、FastMRI和MyConnectome基准测试中达到最先进性能，具有强大的零样本泛化能力，并通过全面消融研究验证。

Conclusion: 通过桥接定量分析与语义推理，该框架生成临床可解释的输出，增强了动态医疗环境中的质量控制。

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) quality assessment is crucial for clinical
decision-making, yet remains challenging due to data scarcity and protocol
variability. Traditional approaches face fundamental trade-offs: signal-based
methods like MRIQC provide quantitative metrics but lack semantic
understanding, while deep learning approaches achieve high accuracy but
sacrifice interpretability. To address these limitations, we introduce the
Multimodal MRI Quality Assessment (MMRQA) framework, pioneering the integration
of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) with acquisition-aware signal
processing. MMRQA combines three key innovations: robust metric extraction via
MRQy augmented with simulated artifacts, structured transformation of metrics
into question-answer pairs using Qwen, and parameter-efficient fusion through
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) of LLaVA-OneVision. Evaluated on MR-ART, FastMRI,
and MyConnectome benchmarks, MMRQA achieves state-of-the-art performance with
strong zero-shot generalization, as validated by comprehensive ablation
studies. By bridging quantitative analysis with semantic reasoning, our
framework generates clinically interpretable outputs that enhance quality
control in dynamic medical settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VagueGAN是一种针对生成模型的攻击方法，通过组合扰动网络PoisonerNet和生成器-判别器对，制作隐蔽触发器来操控生成图像，在GAN和扩散模型中都能实现目标攻击且保持视觉质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注判别模型的对抗攻击，而针对生成模型管道的攻击研究较少，特别是那些能够通过微小扰动控制输出变化的隐蔽攻击。

Method: 结合模块化扰动网络PoisonerNet与生成器-判别器对，设计隐蔽触发器；使用自定义代理指标评估攻击效果，通过感知和频域分析评估隐蔽性；在ControlNet引导的编辑中测试方法在扩散模型中的可迁移性。

Result: 中毒输出相比干净版本可能具有更高的视觉质量；潜在空间中毒可以保留甚至增强输出美感；优化后的扰动能在生成器输出中产生一致且隐蔽的效果。

Conclusion: 潜在空间中毒攻击暴露了像素级防御的盲点，对图像生成管道的完整性构成威胁，需要新的防御机制来应对这类隐蔽攻击。

Abstract: Generative models such as GANs and diffusion models are widely used to
synthesize photorealistic images and to support downstream creative and editing
tasks. While adversarial attacks on discriminative models are well studied,
attacks targeting generative pipelines where small, stealthy perturbations in
inputs lead to controlled changes in outputs are less explored. This study
introduces VagueGAN, an attack pipeline combining a modular perturbation
network PoisonerNet with a Generator Discriminator pair to craft stealthy
triggers that cause targeted changes in generated images. Attack efficacy is
evaluated using a custom proxy metric, while stealth is analyzed through
perceptual and frequency domain measures. The transferability of the method to
a modern diffusion based pipeline is further examined through ControlNet guided
editing. Interestingly, the experiments show that poisoned outputs can display
higher visual quality compared to clean counterparts, challenging the
assumption that poisoning necessarily reduces fidelity. Unlike conventional
pixel level perturbations, latent space poisoning in GANs and diffusion
pipelines can retain or even enhance output aesthetics, exposing a blind spot
in pixel level defenses. Moreover, carefully optimized perturbations can
produce consistent, stealthy effects on generator outputs while remaining
visually inconspicuous, raising concerns for the integrity of image generation
pipelines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏视图下的新视角合成存在过拟合、几何失真和场景恢复不完整的问题，3D高斯溅射在稀疏输入下会产生漂浮伪影和结构不一致。

Method: 提出混合损失深度估计模块、双向扭曲虚拟视图合成方法和遮挡感知重建组件，整合结构线索、虚拟视图约束和遮挡区域补全。

Result: 在LLFF、Blender和DTU基准测试中达到新的最先进水平，PSNR达21.13 dB，LPIPS为0.189，保持实时推理能力。

Conclusion: DWGS通过整合多视图一致性约束和遮挡区域恢复，显著提升了稀疏视图下的3D高斯溅射性能。

Abstract: Novel View Synthesis (NVS) from sparse views remains a core challenge in 3D
reconstruction, typically suffering from overfitting, geometric distortion, and
incomplete scene recovery due to limited multi-view constraints. Although 3D
Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables real-time, high-fidelity rendering, it
suffers from floating artifacts and structural inconsistencies under
sparse-input settings. To address these issues, we propose DWGS, a novel
unified framework that enhances 3DGS for sparse-view synthesis by integrating
robust structural cues, virtual view constraints, and occluded region
completion. Our approach introduces three principal contributions: a
Hybrid-Loss Depth Estimation module that leverages dense matching priors with
reprojection, point propagation, and smoothness constraints to enforce
multi-view consistency; a Bidirectional Warping Virtual View Synthesis method
generates virtual training views to impose stronger geometric and photometric
constraints; and an Occlusion-Aware Reconstruction component that utilizes
depth-difference mask and a learning-based inpainting model to recover obscured
regions. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks (LLFF, Blender, and DTU)
show that DWGS achieves a new state-of-the-art, achieving up to 21.13 dB PSNR
and 0.189 LPIPS, while retaining real-time inference capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有域适应方法将视觉语言模型和数据监督视为独立来源，缺乏有效融合，限制了知识迁移效果。

Method: DAM框架整合多模态监督形成双重监督信号，通过稳定ViL引导目标初始化和双向蒸馏机制，在迭代适应中促进目标模型与双重监督间的知识交换。

Result: 在多个SFADA基准测试和主动学习策略中，DAM始终优于现有方法，创造了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: DAM框架通过有效融合多模态监督和人工标注，显著提升了源自由主动域适应的性能，证明了双重监督策略的有效性。

Abstract: Source-free active domain adaptation (SFADA) enhances knowledge transfer from
a source model to an unlabeled target domain using limited manual labels
selected via active learning. While recent domain adaptation studies have
introduced Vision-and-Language (ViL) models to improve pseudo-label quality or
feature alignment, they often treat ViL-based and data supervision as separate
sources, lacking effective fusion. To overcome this limitation, we propose Dual
Active learning with Multimodal (DAM) foundation model, a novel framework that
integrates multimodal supervision from a ViL model to complement sparse human
annotations, thereby forming a dual supervisory signal. DAM initializes stable
ViL-guided targets and employs a bidirectional distillation mechanism to foster
mutual knowledge exchange between the target model and the dual supervisions
during iterative adaptation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DAM
consistently outperforms existing methods and sets a new state-of-the-art
across multiple SFADA benchmarks and active learning strategies.

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于青少年特发性脊柱侧弯评估的深度学习框架，能够同时预测每个椎体的上下终板角度和对应中点坐标，保留椎体楔形变的解剖学特征，并引入椎体楔形指数用于量化椎体变形和预测曲线进展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统手动测量Cobb角存在显著的观察者间变异性，影响诊断准确性。现有自动化方法使用简化的脊柱模型和预设曲线模式，无法应对临床复杂性。

Method: 结合HRNet骨干网络和Swin-Transformer模块，加入生物力学约束增强特征提取，使用奇异值分解从椎体形态学直接分析角度预测，无需预设曲线假设。

Result: 在630张全脊柱前后位X光片上达到83.45%的诊断准确率和2.55度的平均绝对误差，框架在分布外病例上表现出优异的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 椎体楔形指数与曲线进展存在显著预后相关性，而传统Cobb角无此相关性，为早期AIS检测、个性化治疗规划和进展监测提供了有力支持。

Abstract: Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is a common spinal deformity affecting
approximately 2.2% of boys and 4.8% of girls worldwide. The Cobb angle serves
as the gold standard for AIS severity assessment, yet traditional manual
measurements suffer from significant observer variability, compromising
diagnostic accuracy. Despite prior automation attempts, existing methods use
simplified spinal models and predetermined curve patterns that fail to address
clinical complexity. We present a novel deep learning framework for AIS
assessment that simultaneously predicts both superior and inferior endplate
angles with corresponding midpoint coordinates for each vertebra, preserving
the anatomical reality of vertebral wedging in progressive AIS. Our approach
combines an HRNet backbone with Swin-Transformer modules and biomechanically
informed constraints for enhanced feature extraction. We employ Singular Value
Decomposition (SVD) to analyze angle predictions directly from vertebral
morphology, enabling flexible detection of diverse scoliosis patterns without
predefined curve assumptions. Using 630 full-spine anteroposterior radiographs
from patients aged 10-18 years with rigorous dual-rater annotation, our method
achieved 83.45% diagnostic accuracy and 2.55{\deg} mean absolute error. The
framework demonstrates exceptional generalization capability on
out-of-distribution cases. Additionally, we introduce the Vertebral Wedging
Index (VWI), a novel metric quantifying vertebral deformation. Longitudinal
analysis revealed VWI's significant prognostic correlation with curve
progression while traditional Cobb angles showed no correlation, providing
robust support for early AIS detection, personalized treatment planning, and
progression monitoring.

*Mohsen Ghafoorian,Denis Korzhenkov,Amirhossein Habibian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Attention Surgery是一个无需从头训练即可将预训练视频扩散模型中的注意力机制线性化或混合化的高效框架，在保持生成质量的同时将注意力计算成本降低高达40%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于Transformer的视频扩散模型虽然生成质量优秀，但自注意力机制的二阶计算成本限制了长序列和高分辨率视频的生成效率。现有的线性注意力方法无法在不进行昂贵重新训练的情况下匹配softmax注意力的表达能力。

Method: 结合了混合注意力机制（混合softmax和线性token）、轻量级蒸馏和微调流程，以及成本感知的块率策略来平衡各层的表达能力和效率。

Result: 在Wan2.1 1.3B模型上应用Attention Surgery，实现了首个具有竞争力的次二阶注意力视频扩散模型，在VBench和VBench-2.0基准测试中保持生成质量的同时，将注意力FLOPs降低高达40%。

Conclusion: Attention Surgery提供了一种高效的方法来优化预训练视频扩散模型的注意力机制，在保持性能的同时显著降低计算成本。

Abstract: Transformer-based video diffusion models (VDMs) deliver state-of-the-art
video generation quality but are constrained by the quadratic cost of
self-attention, making long sequences and high resolutions computationally
expensive. While linear attention offers sub-quadratic complexity, prior
attempts fail to match the expressiveness of softmax attention without costly
retraining. We introduce \textit{Attention Surgery}, an efficient framework for
\textit{linearizing} or \textit{hybridizing} attention in pretrained VDMs
without training from scratch. Inspired by recent advances in language models,
our method combines a novel hybrid attention mechanism-mixing softmax and
linear tokens-with a lightweight distillation and fine-tuning pipeline
requiring only a few GPU-days. Additionally, we incorporate a cost-aware
block-rate strategy to balance expressiveness and efficiency across layers.
Applied to Wan2.1 1.3B, a state-of-the-art DiT-based VDM, Attention Surgery
achieves the first competitive sub-quadratic attention video diffusion models,
reducing attention cost by up to 40\% in terms of FLOPs, while maintaining
generation quality as measured on the standard VBench and VBench-2.0
benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集缺乏系统结构和真实应用场景，限制了统一多模态模型的性能发展。

Method: 采用层次化任务分类法，结合结构化资源池和GPT-4o的自动化流水线，生成覆盖11个主要领域和51个子任务的数据。

Result: 在多个基准测试中取得显著性能提升：编辑任务提升18%（UniWorld-V1在ImgEdit-Bench），生成任务提升13%（Harmon在GenEval）。

Conclusion: 系统化的数据构建是推进多模态AI能力的关键。

Abstract: The performance of unified multimodal models for image generation and editing
is fundamentally constrained by the quality and comprehensiveness of their
training data. While existing datasets have covered basic tasks like style
transfer and simple object manipulation, they often lack the systematic
structure and challenging scenarios required for real-world applications. To
address this bottleneck, we introduce OpenGPT-4o-Image, a large-scale dataset
constructed using a novel methodology that combines hierarchical task taxonomy
with automated data generation. Our taxonomy not only includes fundamental
capabilities such as text rendering and style control but also introduces
highly practical yet challenging categories like scientific imagery for
chemistry illustrations and complex instruction editing requiring simultaneous
execution of multiple operations. Through an automated pipeline leveraging
structured resource pools and GPT-4o, we generate 80k high-quality
instruction-image pairs with controlled diversity, covering 11 major domains
and 51 subtasks. Extensive experiments show that fine-tuning leading models on
our dataset achieves significant performance gains across multiple benchmarks,
with improvements of up to 18\% on editing tasks (UniWorld-V1 on ImgEdit-Bench)
and 13% on generation tasks (Harmon on GenEval). Our work demonstrates that
systematic data construction is key to advancing multimodal AI capabilities.

TL;DR: 提出SID方法，通过自我改进的演示来增强目标导向的语言引导导航，显著提升探索能力和泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖最短路径轨迹，缺乏有效的探索先验来训练导航智能体，导致在未知环境中导航能力不足。

Method: SID首先在环境采样的最短路径数据上训练初始智能体，然后利用该智能体生成新颖的探索轨迹，通过迭代自我改进管道不断提升智能体性能。

Result: SID在REVERIE和SOON等目标导向语言导航任务上取得最先进性能，在SOON未见验证集上达到50.9%的成功率，比之前领先方法提升13.9%。

Conclusion: SID方法通过自我改进演示有效提升了导航智能体的探索能力和泛化性能，在多种语言引导导航任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Goal-oriented language-guided navigation requires robust exploration
capabilities for agents to navigate to specified goals in unknown environments
without step-by-step instructions. Existing methods tend to exclusively utilize
shortest-path trajectories, lacking effective exploration priors for training
navigation agents. To address the above challenges, we present SID, a
goal-oriented language-guided navigation learning approach with Self-Improving
Demonstrations. Specifically, SID learns an initial agent on the shortest-path
data sampled from environments and then leverages this agent to generate novel
exploration trajectories. The novel rollouts provide demonstrations with
stronger exploration strategies to train a better agent, which in turn produces
higher-quality agent demonstrations for the next round of training. We show
that this iterative self-improving pipeline readily scales to new environments,
and the resulting demonstrations can be transferred across a variety of
language-guided navigation tasks, elevating the performance ceiling in diverse
goal-oriented navigation tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SID
significantly boosts the exploration capabilities and generalization of
navigation agents. The resulting agent achieves new state-of-the-art
performance on goal-oriented language-guided navigation tasks, including
REVERIE, SOON, notably achieving a 50.9% success rate on the unseen validation
splits of SOON, surpassing the prior leading approaches by a margin of 13.9%.

TL;DR: 提出Seg-CFT方法，用于生成结构特定的反事实图像，避免传统方法在结构干预时产生的全局不良影响，无需用户提供繁琐的像素级标签图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前反事实图像生成方法依赖外部分类器或回归器，对于结构特定干预（如改变左肺区域）效果不足，会产生不希望的全局影响，且需要用户提供难以获取的像素级标签图。

Method: 提出Segmentor-guided Counterfactual Fine-Tuning (Seg-CFT)方法，在保持对结构特定标量变量干预简单性的同时，生成局部一致且有效的反事实图像。

Result: 展示了生成真实胸部X光片的能力，并在冠状动脉疾病建模方面显示出有希望的结果。

Conclusion: Seg-CFT方法能够有效生成结构特定的反事实图像，避免了传统方法的局限性，为医学图像分析和疾病建模提供了更好的工具。

Abstract: Counterfactual image generation is a powerful tool for augmenting training
data, de-biasing datasets, and modeling disease. Current approaches rely on
external classifiers or regressors to increase the effectiveness of
subject-level interventions (e.g., changing the patient's age). For
structure-specific interventions (e.g., changing the area of the left lung in a
chest radiograph), we show that this is insufficient, and can result in
undesirable global effects across the image domain. Previous work used
pixel-level label maps as guidance, requiring a user to provide hypothetical
segmentations which are tedious and difficult to obtain. We propose
Segmentor-guided Counterfactual Fine-Tuning (Seg-CFT), which preserves the
simplicity of intervening on scalar-valued, structure-specific variables while
producing locally coherent and effective counterfactuals. We demonstrate the
capability of generating realistic chest radiographs, and we show promising
results for modeling coronary artery disease. Code:

TL;DR: 本文研究了GAN的可扩展性，通过在VAE潜在空间中训练并使用纯transformer架构，解决了GAN规模化过程中的问题，提出了轻量级中间监督和宽度感知学习率调整等方法，在ImageNet-256上实现了SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索生成对抗网络（GANs）的可扩展性，虽然规模化在其他生成模型中已被证明有效，但在对抗学习中的规模化原则仍未被充分探索。

Method: 在紧凑的变分自编码器（VAE）潜在空间中训练，采用纯transformer架构的生成器和判别器，通过轻量级中间监督和宽度感知学习率调整解决规模化问题。

Result: GAT-XL/2在ImageNet-256上实现了2.96的FID分数，仅需40个epoch，比强基线少6倍训练轮数，达到了单步、类条件生成的SOTA性能。

Conclusion: 通过在潜在空间训练和纯transformer架构，结合适当的规模化解决方案，GANs可以实现可靠的大规模训练，并在多个容量级别（S到XL）都表现良好。

Abstract: Scalability has driven recent advances in generative modeling, yet its
principles remain underexplored for adversarial learning. We investigate the
scalability of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) through two design
choices that have proven to be effective in other types of generative models:
training in a compact Variational Autoencoder latent space and adopting purely
transformer-based generators and discriminators. Training in latent space
enables efficient computation while preserving perceptual fidelity, and this
efficiency pairs naturally with plain transformers, whose performance scales
with computational budget. Building on these choices, we analyze failure modes
that emerge when naively scaling GANs. Specifically, we find issues as
underutilization of early layers in the generator and optimization instability
as the network scales. Accordingly, we provide simple and scale-friendly
solutions as lightweight intermediate supervision and width-aware learning-rate
adjustment. Our experiments show that GAT, a purely transformer-based and
latent-space GANs, can be easily trained reliably across a wide range of
capacities (S through XL). Moreover, GAT-XL/2 achieves state-of-the-art
single-step, class-conditional generation performance (FID of 2.96) on
ImageNet-256 in just 40 epochs, 6x fewer epochs than strong baselines.

TL;DR: CogniGPT是一个基于人类渐进视觉认知的长视频理解框架，通过多粒度感知代理和验证增强反思代理的交互循环，高效可靠地提取任务相关信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长视频具有时间复杂性和稀疏任务相关信息的特点，现有LLM方法难以同时实现信息捕获的完整性和效率。

Method: 采用MGPA模仿人类视觉注意机制捕获任务相关信息，VERA验证关键线索以减少幻觉并优化后续感知策略，通过交互过程探索最小化且可靠的任务相关线索集。

Result: 在EgoSchema、Video-MME、NExT-QA和MovieChat数据集上的实验显示，CogniGPT在准确性和效率方面均表现优越，在EgoSchema上仅使用11.2帧就超越现有免训练方法，性能与Gemini 1.5-Pro相当。

Conclusion: CogniGPT通过模拟人类渐进视觉认知的交互框架，实现了长视频理解的高效性和可靠性，为复杂视频分析提供了新思路。

Abstract: Long videos, characterized by temporal complexity and sparse task-relevant
information, pose significant reasoning challenges for AI systems. Although
various Large Language Model (LLM)-based approaches have advanced long video
understanding, they still struggle to achieve both completeness and efficiency
in capturing task-critical information. Inspired by human progressive visual
cognition, we propose CogniGPT, a framework that leverages an interactive loop
between Multi-Granular Perception Agent (MGPA) and Verification-Enhanced
Reflection Agent (VERA) for efficient and reliable long video understanding.
Specifically, MGPA mimics human visual divergent and focused attention to
capture task-related information, while VERA verifies perceived key clues to
mitigate hallucination and optimize subsequent perception strategies. Through
this interactive process, CogniGPT explores a minimal set of informative and
reliable task-related clues. Extensive experiments on EgoSchema, Video-MME,
NExT-QA, and MovieChat datasets demonstrate CogniGPT's superiority in both
accuracy and efficiency. Notably, on EgoSchema, it surpasses existing
training-free methods using only 11.2 frames and achieves performance
comparable to Gemini 1.5-Pro.

TL;DR: 温度缩放（TS）作为后处理校准技术，能显著提高卷积神经网络在脑肿瘤分类中的置信度可靠性，特别是在各种图像噪声条件下降低校准误差而不影响分类准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医学影像等高风险领域，深度学习模型的精确置信度估计至关重要，过度自信的错误分类可能带来严重后果。

Method: 开发自定义CNN并在合并的脑MRI数据集上训练，引入五种图像噪声模拟现实世界不确定性，使用温度缩放进行后处理校准。

Result: 在所有噪声条件下，温度缩放显著降低了预期校准误差（ECE）和负对数似然（NLL），同时没有降低分类准确率。

Conclusion: 温度缩放是提高医学AI系统决策置信度的有效且计算高效的方法，使模型输出在噪声或不确定环境中更加可靠。

Abstract: Precise confidence estimation in deep learning is vital for high-stakes
fields like medical imaging, where overconfident misclassifications can have
serious consequences. This work evaluates the effectiveness of Temperature
Scaling (TS), a post-hoc calibration technique, in improving the reliability of
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for brain tumor classification. We develop
a custom CNN and train it on a merged brain MRI dataset. To simulate real-world
uncertainty, five types of image noise are introduced: Gaussian, Poisson, Salt
& Pepper, Speckle, and Uniform. Model performance is evaluated using precision,
recall, F1-score, accuracy, negative log-likelihood (NLL), and expected
calibration error (ECE), both before and after calibration. Results demonstrate
that TS significantly reduces ECE and NLL under all noise conditions without
degrading classification accuracy. This underscores TS as an effective and
computationally efficient approach to enhance decision confidence of medical AI
systems, hence making model outputs more reliable in noisy or uncertain
settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Social 3D Scene Graphs，一种增强的3D场景图表示，用于捕捉人类及其在环境中的属性、活动和关系，包括本地和远程关系，并引入了一个新的基准数据集用于评估3D社交场景理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D场景图方法主要忽略场景中的人类，缺乏标注的人类-环境关系数据，且通常只能从单帧图像中捕捉开放词汇关系，限制了建模长距离交互的能力。

Method: 开发了Social 3D Scene Graphs表示，使用开放词汇框架捕捉人类属性、活动和环境关系；创建了包含全面人类-场景关系标注的合成环境基准数据集。

Result: 实验表明，该表示方法提高了人类活动预测能力和对人类-环境关系的推理能力。

Conclusion: 该方法为开发具有社交智能的机器人铺平了道路。

Abstract: Understanding how people interact with their surroundings and each other is
essential for enabling robots to act in socially compliant and context-aware
ways. While 3D Scene Graphs have emerged as a powerful semantic representation
for scene understanding, existing approaches largely ignore humans in the
scene, also due to the lack of annotated human-environment relationships.
Moreover, existing methods typically capture only open-vocabulary relations
from single image frames, which limits their ability to model long-range
interactions beyond the observed content. We introduce Social 3D Scene Graphs,
an augmented 3D Scene Graph representation that captures humans, their
attributes, activities and relationships in the environment, both local and
remote, using an open-vocabulary framework. Furthermore, we introduce a new
benchmark consisting of synthetic environments with comprehensive human-scene
relationship annotations and diverse types of queries for evaluating social
scene understanding in 3D. The experiments demonstrate that our representation
improves human activity prediction and reasoning about human-environment
relations, paving the way toward socially intelligent robots.

TL;DR: 提出基于跨模态融合注意力和自监督多事件表示学习的事件相机面部关键点对齐框架，解决事件数据空间信息有限和标注数据缺乏的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 事件相机在低光照和快速运动条件下具有优势，但现有RGB方法在事件数据上表现不佳，且仅用事件数据训练效果不理想，同时缺乏标注事件数据集。

Method: 使用跨模态融合注意力整合RGB数据指导特征提取，同时采用自监督多事件表示学习从无标签事件数据中学习有效特征。

Result: 在真实事件数据集E-SIE和合成事件数据集WFLW-V上的实验表明，该方法在多个评估指标上均优于现有最优方法。

Conclusion: 提出的跨模态融合和自监督学习框架有效解决了事件相机面部关键点对齐中的空间信息有限和标注数据缺乏问题。

Abstract: Event cameras offer unique advantages for facial keypoint alignment under
challenging conditions, such as low light and rapid motion, due to their high
temporal resolution and robustness to varying illumination. However, existing
RGB facial keypoint alignment methods do not perform well on event data, and
training solely on event data often leads to suboptimal performance because of
its limited spatial information. Moreover, the lack of comprehensive labeled
event datasets further hinders progress in this area. To address these issues,
we propose a novel framework based on cross-modal fusion attention (CMFA) and
self-supervised multi-event representation learning (SSMER) for event-based
facial keypoint alignment. Our framework employs CMFA to integrate
corresponding RGB data, guiding the model to extract robust facial features
from event input images. In parallel, SSMER enables effective feature learning
from unlabeled event data, overcoming spatial limitations. Extensive
experiments on our real-event E-SIE dataset and a synthetic-event version of
the public WFLW-V benchmark show that our approach consistently surpasses
state-of-the-art methods across multiple evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: 提出的动态数据增强策略有效提升了脑胶质瘤分割的泛化能力，在挑战赛中取得了最佳性能。

Abstract: Robust segmentation across both pre-treatment and post-treatment glioma scans
can be helpful for consistent tumor monitoring and treatment planning. BraTS
2025 Task 1 addresses this by challenging models to generalize across varying
tumor appearances throughout the treatment timeline. However, training such
generalized models requires access to diverse, high-quality annotated data,
which is often limited. While data augmentation can alleviate this, storing
large volumes of augmented 3D data is computationally expensive. To address
these challenges, we propose an on-the-fly augmentation strategy that
dynamically inserts synthetic tumors using pretrained generative adversarial
networks (GliGANs) during training. We evaluate three nnU-Net-based models and
their ensembles: (1) a baseline without external augmentation, (2) a regular
on-the-fly augmented model, and (3) a model with customized on-the-fly
augmentation. Built upon the nnU-Net framework, our pipeline leverages
pretrained GliGAN weights and tumor insertion methods from prior
challenge-winning solutions. An ensemble of the three models achieves
lesion-wise Dice scores of 0.79 (ET), 0.749 (NETC), 0.872 (RC), 0.825 (SNFH),
0.79 (TC), and 0.88 (WT) on the online BraTS 2025 validation platform. This

encodes the alpha channel into the RGB latent space. Then, to support the
training of our diffusion transformer, we construct a high-quality and diverse
RGBA video dataset. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, our model
demonstrates superior performance in visual quality, motion realism, and
transparency rendering. Notably, our model can generate a wide variety of

TL;DR: SDPose是一个基于Stable Diffusion的微调框架，用于人体姿态估计，通过直接在SD U-Net的潜在空间中预测关键点热图来充分利用预训练扩散先验，在少量训练下达到与Sapiens相当的性能，并在跨域基准上创下新纪录。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练扩散模型提供了丰富的多尺度潜在特征，但它们在结构化输出（如人体姿态估计）方面的潜力尚未充分探索。现有方法如Marigold和Lotus主要关注密集预测，而SDPose旨在充分利用扩散先验进行人体姿态估计。

Method: 1. 直接在SD U-Net的图像潜在空间中预测关键点热图，保持原始生成先验；2. 通过轻量级卷积姿态头将潜在特征映射到关键点热图；3. 加入辅助RGB重建分支以防止过拟合并增强跨域鲁棒性。

Result: 仅使用Sapiens在COCO上训练计划的五分之一，SDPose在COCO验证集上与Sapiens-1B/2B表现相当，在跨域基准HumanArt和COCO-OOD上创下新纪录。还能作为零样本姿态标注器用于下游可控生成任务。

Conclusion: SDPose证明了预训练扩散模型作为视觉骨干在结构化预测任务中的有效性，通过保持生成先验和轻量级适配实现了优异的跨域泛化能力。

Abstract: Pre-trained diffusion models provide rich multi-scale latent features and are
emerging as powerful vision backbones. While recent works such as
Marigold~\citep{ke2024repurposing} and Lotus~\citep{he2024lotus} adapt
diffusion priors for dense prediction with strong cross-domain generalization,
their potential for structured outputs (e.g., human pose estimation) remains
underexplored. In this paper, we propose \textbf{SDPose}, a fine-tuning
framework built upon Stable Diffusion to fully exploit pre-trained diffusion
priors for human pose estimation. First, rather than modifying cross-attention
modules or introducing learnable embeddings, we directly predict keypoint
heatmaps in the SD U-Net's image latent space to preserve the original
generative priors. Second, we map these latent features into keypoint heatmaps
through a lightweight convolutional pose head, which avoids disrupting the
pre-trained backbone. Finally, to prevent overfitting and enhance
out-of-distribution robustness, we incorporate an auxiliary RGB reconstruction
branch that preserves domain-transferable generative semantics. To evaluate
robustness under domain shift, we further construct \textbf{COCO-OOD}, a
style-transferred variant of COCO with preserved annotations. With just
one-fifth of the training schedule used by Sapiens on COCO, SDPose attains
parity with Sapiens-1B/2B on the COCO validation set and establishes a new
state of the art on the cross-domain benchmarks HumanArt and COCO-OOD.
Furthermore, we showcase SDPose as a zero-shot pose annotator for downstream
controllable generation tasks, including ControlNet-based image synthesis and
video generation, where it delivers qualitatively superior pose guidance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法受限于窄视场角限制或相机可控性不足，无法合成连续完整的场景或支持用户自由探索。

Method: 首先在虚拟3D环境中通过Unreal Engine模拟相机轨迹构建大规模全景视频-探索路径数据集，然后引入球面感知扩散变换器架构，将等矩形特征重投影到球面以建模几何邻接关系。

Result: 广泛实验表明PanoWorld-X在运动范围、控制精度和视觉质量等方面均表现出优越性能。

Conclusion: 该框架在真实世界应用中具有巨大潜力，能够生成高保真且可控的全景视频。

Abstract: Generating a complete and explorable 360-degree visual world enables a wide
range of downstream applications. While prior works have advanced the field,
they remain constrained by either narrow field-of-view limitations, which
hinder the synthesis of continuous and holistic scenes, or insufficient camera
controllability that restricts free exploration by users or autonomous agents.
To address this, we propose PanoWorld-X, a novel framework for high-fidelity
and controllable panoramic video generation with diverse camera trajectories.
Specifically, we first construct a large-scale dataset of panoramic
video-exploration route pairs by simulating camera trajectories in virtual 3D
environments via Unreal Engine. As the spherical geometry of panoramic data
misaligns with the inductive priors from conventional video diffusion, we then
introduce a Sphere-Aware Diffusion Transformer architecture that reprojects
equirectangular features onto the spherical surface to model geometric
adjacency in latent space, significantly enhancing visual fidelity and
spatiotemporal continuity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
PanoWorld-X achieves superior performance in various aspects, including motion
range, control precision, and visual quality, underscoring its potential for
real-world applications.

*Tooba Imtiaz,Lucy Chai,Kathryn Heal,Xuan Luo,Jungyeon Park,Jennifer Dy,John Flynn*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Local View Transformer (LVT)架构，通过局部注意力机制避免标准Transformer的二次复杂度问题，实现大规模场景重建和新视角合成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准Transformer在3D视觉和新视角合成中面临二次复杂度问题，难以扩展到大规模场景。

Method: 使用局部邻域处理机制，基于相对几何变换的位置编码，将输出解码为3D高斯泼溅场景表示。

Result: 能够单次前向传播重建任意大规模、高分辨率场景。

Conclusion: LVT架构有效解决了Transformer在大规模3D场景重建中的可扩展性问题。

Abstract: Large transformer models are proving to be a powerful tool for 3D vision and
novel view synthesis. However, the standard Transformer's well-known quadratic
complexity makes it difficult to scale these methods to large scenes. To
address this challenge, we propose the Local View Transformer (LVT), a
large-scale scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis architecture that
circumvents the need for the quadratic attention operation. Motivated by the
insight that spatially nearby views provide more useful signal about the local
scene composition than distant views, our model processes all information in a
local neighborhood around each view. To attend to tokens in nearby views, we
leverage a novel positional encoding that conditions on the relative geometric
transformation between the query and nearby views. We decode the output of our
model into a 3D Gaussian Splat scene representation that includes both color
and opacity view-dependence. Taken together, the Local View Transformer enables
reconstruction of arbitrarily large, high-resolution scenes in a single forward
pass. See our project page for results and interactive demos

*Max Curie,Paulo da Costa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLASP是一个无需标签数据或微调的轻量级无监督图像分割框架，使用自监督ViT编码器提取特征，通过谱聚类和自适应参数选择实现自动分割。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决无监督图像分割问题，特别是在数字广告和营销工作流中处理大量未标注数据的需求，如品牌安全筛查、创意资产管理和社交媒体内容审核。

Method: 使用DINO自监督ViT编码器提取补丁特征，构建亲和矩阵并应用谱聚类，通过特征间隙轮廓搜索自动选择分割数量，使用DenseCRF锐化边界。

Result: 在COCO Stuff和ADE20K数据集上达到具有竞争力的mIoU和像素精度，与近期无监督基线方法表现相当。

Conclusion: CLASP提供了一个简单、无需训练且易于复现的强基线方法，特别适用于处理大规模未标注数据集的场景。

Abstract: We introduce CLASP (Clustering via Adaptive Spectral Processing), a
lightweight framework for unsupervised image segmentation that operates without
any labeled data or finetuning. CLASP first extracts per patch features using a
self supervised ViT encoder (DINO); then, it builds an affinity matrix and
applies spectral clustering. To avoid manual tuning, we select the segment
count automatically with a eigengap silhouette search, and we sharpen the
boundaries with a fully connected DenseCRF. Despite its simplicity and training
free nature, CLASP attains competitive mIoU and pixel accuracy on COCO Stuff
and ADE20K, matching recent unsupervised baselines. The zero training design
makes CLASP a strong, easily reproducible baseline for large unannotated
corpora especially common in digital advertising and marketing workflows such
as brand safety screening, creative asset curation, and social media content
moderation

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管强化学习在自然图像领域展现出强大的推理能力，但其在地球观测任务中的潜力尚未充分探索。地球观测任务面临独特挑战，需要任务感知的推理能力。

Method: 采用后训练框架，结合任务感知奖励来适应性地调整基于推理的强化学习模型，以应对不同的地球观测任务。

Result: 在多个地球观测基准测试中，该方法相比最先进的通用和专业视觉语言模型都取得了持续的性能提升。

Conclusion: 该训练策略增强了遥感图像的推理能力，稳定了优化过程，并提高了鲁棒性。

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have delivered strong
reasoning capabilities in natural image domains, yet their potential for Earth
Observation (EO) remains largely unexplored. EO tasks introduce unique
challenges, spanning referred object detection, image or region captioning,
change detection, grounding, and temporal analysis, that demand task aware
reasoning. We propose a novel post training framework that incorporates task
aware rewards to enable effective adaptation of reasoning based RL models to
diverse EO tasks. This training strategy enhances reasoning capabilities for
remote sensing images, stabilizes optimization, and improves robustness.
Extensive experiments across multiple EO benchmarks show consistent performance
gains over state of the art generic and specialized vision language models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了STAGE框架，通过优势/KL重加权和熵奖励来解决GRPO在自回归图像生成中的训练不稳定问题，提高图像质量和泛化能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GRPO算法应用于自回归图像模型时存在训练不稳定问题，容易破坏预训练模型能力，导致收益有限、图像质量下降和泛化能力差

Method: 1. 优势/KL重加权：相似性感知重加权缓解冲突更新；2. 熵奖励：基于参考模型的熵奖励来稳定学习

Result: 在多个基准测试中，STAGE相比基线GRPO持续改善了视觉质量、稳定性和跨任务泛化能力

Conclusion: 通过缓解token间的冲突和使用熵奖励稳定训练，STAGE减少了预训练分布的破坏并缓解了奖励黑客问题，从而改善了泛化能力并更好地迁移到其他基准测试

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has recently been explored to improve text-to-image
generation, yet applying existing GRPO algorithms to autoregressive (AR) image
models remains challenging. The instability of the training process easily
disrupts the pretrained model capability during long runs, resulting in
marginal gains, degraded image quality, and poor generalization. In this work,
we revisit GRPO for AR image generation and identify two key issues:
contradictory gradients from unnecessary tokens and unstable policy entropy
dynamics. To address these, we introduce STAGE, a stable and generalizable
framework that leverages two targeted solutions: 1) Advantage/KL reweighting.
Similarity-aware reweighting to alleviate conflicting updates; and 2) Entropy
reward. An entropy-based reward corresponding to reference model to stabilize
learning. With the help of alleviating conflicts between tokens and an entropy
reward for stabilizing training, we reduce disruption of the pretrained
distribution and mitigate reward hacking, which in turn improves generalization
and transfer better to other benchmarks. Experiments across multiple benchmarks
show that STAGE consistently improves visual quality, stability, and cross-task
generalization compared to baseline GRPO.

*Wenhao Li,Qiangchang Wang,Xianjing Meng,Zhibin Wu,Yilong Yin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VT-FSL是一个新颖的少样本学习框架，通过交叉模态迭代提示和几何对齐，将大型语言模型与视觉信息结合，在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的少样本学习方法由于缺乏实际实例的grounding，会产生与视觉证据矛盾的语义幻觉，导致噪声指导和昂贵的修正成本。

Method: 提出交叉模态迭代提示(CIP)和交叉模态几何对齐(CGA)。CIP基于类名和支持图像条件化LLM生成精确的类描述；CGA通过最小化三维平行多面体的核化体积来对齐文本、支持和合成视觉表示。

Result: 在十个不同的基准测试中建立了新的最先进性能，包括标准、跨领域和细粒度少样本学习场景。

Conclusion: VT-FSL通过精确的跨模态提示和几何感知对齐，有效解决了少样本学习中的语义幻觉问题，实现了结构化和一致的多模态集成。

Abstract: Few-shot learning (FSL) aims to recognize novel concepts from only a few
labeled support samples. Recent studies enhance support features by
incorporating additional semantic information or designing complex semantic
fusion modules. However, they still suffer from hallucinating semantics that
contradict the visual evidence due to the lack of grounding in actual
instances, resulting in noisy guidance and costly corrections. To address these
issues, we propose a novel framework, bridging Vision and Text with LLMs for
Few-Shot Learning (VT-FSL), which constructs precise cross-modal prompts
conditioned on Large Language Models (LLMs) and support images, seamlessly
integrating them through a geometry-aware alignment. It mainly consists of
Cross-modal Iterative Prompting (CIP) and Cross-modal Geometric Alignment
(CGA). Specifically, the CIP conditions an LLM on both class names and support
images to generate precise class descriptions iteratively in a single
structured reasoning pass. These descriptions not only enrich the semantic
understanding of novel classes but also enable the zero-shot synthesis of
semantically consistent images. The descriptions and synthetic images act
respectively as complementary textual and visual prompts, providing high-level
class semantics and low-level intra-class diversity to compensate for limited
support data. Furthermore, the CGA jointly aligns the fused textual, support,
and synthetic visual representations by minimizing the kernelized volume of the
3-dimensional parallelotope they span. It captures global and nonlinear
relationships among all representations, enabling structured and consistent
multimodal integration. The proposed VT-FSL method establishes new
state-of-the-art performance across ten diverse benchmarks, including standard,
cross-domain, and fine-grained few-shot learning scenarios. Code is available
at https://github.com/peacelwh/VT-FSL.

representations (coordinate- and angle-based) are presented for the pipeline.
In addition, an efficient method to improve robustness against camera angle
variations is also introduced by using artificially rotated training data.

accuracy across varying viewing angles and speeds. Finally, an approach to

TL;DR: FFDP是一个用于大规模图像配准的IO感知非GEMM融合内核和分布式框架，能够处理比现有方法大64倍的问题，在8个A6000 GPU上1分钟内完成570倍于标准临床数据的大规模配准任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图像配准是生物医学和生命科学中的基本逆问题，但现有算法未能跟上图像采集能力的发展速度，需要解决大规模配准的计算瓶颈。

Method: 开发了IO感知的非GEMM融合内核，结合分布式框架，优化非GEMM瓶颈并实现卷积感知的张量分片，补充现有的模型并行技术。

Result: 在8个A6000 GPU上1分钟内完成100微米分辨率人脑MRI体积的多模态配准，加速现有最优方法6-7倍，降低峰值内存消耗20-59%，单GPU可处理比现有方法大64倍的问题。

Conclusion: FFDP框架实现了前所未有的图像配准规模能力，在性能和效率方面均优于现有最先进方法，为大规模生物医学图像分析提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: In this work, we propose FFDP, a set of IO-aware non-GEMM fused kernels
supplemented with a distributed framework for image registration at
unprecedented scales. Image registration is an inverse problem fundamental to
biomedical and life sciences, but algorithms have not scaled in tandem with
image acquisition capabilities. Our framework complements existing model
parallelism techniques proposed for large-scale transformer training by
optimizing non-GEMM bottlenecks and enabling convolution-aware tensor sharding.
We demonstrate unprecedented capabilities by performing multimodal registration
of a 100 micron ex-vivo human brain MRI volume at native resolution - an
inverse problem more than 570x larger than a standard clinical datum in about a
minute using only 8 A6000 GPUs. FFDP accelerates existing state-of-the-art
optimization and deep learning registration pipelines by upto 6 - 7x while
reducing peak memory consumption by 20 - 59%. Comparative analysis on a 250
micron dataset shows that FFDP can fit upto 64x larger problems than existing
SOTA on a single GPU, and highlights both the performance and efficiency gains
of FFDP compared to SOTA image registration methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GEM是一种基于3D高斯泼溅的冷冻电镜重建框架，直接在实空间操作，实现了训练速度提升48%、内存使用降低12%，同时局部分辨率提升38.8%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 冷冻电镜数据集规模庞大，传统傅里叶空间方法效率高但保真度低，而基于神经辐射场的实空间方法精度高但内存和计算开销呈立方增长

Method: 使用紧凑的3D高斯表示蛋白质，每个高斯仅用11个参数参数化，并设计了新颖的梯度计算来优化对每个体素有贡献的3D高斯

Result: 在标准冷冻电镜基准测试中，GEM相比最先进方法实现了48%更快的训练速度、12%更低的内存使用，以及高达38.8%的局部分辨率提升

Conclusion: GEM为冷冻电镜重建提供了一个实用且可扩展的范式，统一了速度、效率和高分辨率精度

Abstract: Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has become a central tool for
high-resolution structural biology, yet the massive scale of datasets (often
exceeding 100k particle images) renders 3D reconstruction both computationally
expensive and memory intensive. Traditional Fourier-space methods are efficient
but lose fidelity due to repeated transforms, while recent real-space
approaches based on neural radiance fields (NeRFs) improve accuracy but incur
cubic memory and computation overhead. Therefore, we introduce GEM, a novel
cryo-EM reconstruction framework built on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) that
operates directly in real-space while maintaining high efficiency. Instead of
modeling the entire density volume, GEM represents proteins with compact 3D
Gaussians, each parameterized by only 11 values. To further improve the
training efficiency, we designed a novel gradient computation to 3D Gaussians
that contribute to each voxel. This design substantially reduced both memory
footprint and training cost. On standard cryo-EM benchmarks, GEM achieves up to
48% faster training and 12% lower memory usage compared to state-of-the-art
methods, while improving local resolution by as much as 38.8%. These results
establish GEM as a practical and scalable paradigm for cryo-EM reconstruction,
unifying speed, efficiency, and high-resolution accuracy. Our code is available

Abstract: Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) is a foundational task for computer vision.
Traditional methods are limited by data scarcity and quality, hindering their
robustness. To overcome this, we propose BRIDGE, an RL-optimized depth-to-image
(D2I) generation framework that synthesizes over 20M realistic and
geometrically accurate RGB images, each intrinsically paired with its ground
truth depth, from diverse source depth maps. Then we train our depth estimation
model on this dataset, employing a hybrid supervision strategy that integrates
teacher pseudo-labels with ground truth depth for comprehensive and robust
training. This innovative data generation and training paradigm enables BRIDGE
to achieve breakthroughs in scale and domain diversity, consistently
outperforming existing state-of-the-art approaches quantitatively and in
complex scene detail capture, thereby fostering general and robust depth
features. Code and models are available at

TL;DR: UniLat3D是一个统一的3D资产生成框架，通过单一潜在空间同时编码几何和外观信息，实现单阶段高质量3D生成。


<details>

Motivation: 现有3D预训练模型大多采用两阶段流水线（先几何后外观），导致几何-纹理不对齐和成本高昂的问题。

Method: 提出几何-外观统一VAE，将高分辨率稀疏特征压缩为紧凑潜在表示UniLat，并训练单一流匹配模型从高斯噪声直接映射到UniLat。

Conclusion: UniLat3D通过统一表示和单阶段生成，解决了传统两阶段方法的对齐问题和效率问题，实现了高效高质量的3D资产生成。

Abstract: High-fidelity 3D asset generation is crucial for various industries. While
recent 3D pretrained models show strong capability in producing realistic
content, most are built upon diffusion models and follow a two-stage pipeline
that first generates geometry and then synthesizes appearance. Such a decoupled
design tends to produce geometry-texture misalignment and non-negligible cost.
In this paper, we propose UniLat3D, a unified framework that encodes geometry
and appearance in a single latent space, enabling direct single-stage
generation. Our key contribution is a geometry-appearance Unified VAE, which
compresses high-resolution sparse features into a compact latent representation
-- UniLat. UniLat integrates structural and visual information into a dense
low-resolution latent, which can be efficiently decoded into diverse 3D
formats, e.g., 3D Gaussians and meshes. Based on this unified representation,
we train a single flow-matching model to map Gaussian noise directly into
UniLat, eliminating redundant stages. Trained solely on public datasets,
UniLat3D produces high-quality 3D assets in seconds from a single image,
achieving superior appearance fidelity and geometric quality. More demos \&
code are available at https://unilat3d.github.io/

TL;DR: MANI-Pure是一种基于扩散模型的对抗净化框架，通过自适应频率噪声注入来消除对抗扰动，在保持清洁精度的同时显著提升鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗净化方法使用均匀噪声注入，会破坏语义结构并削弱鲁棒性。研究发现对抗扰动主要集中在高频区域，且在不同频率和攻击类型中呈现异质性强度模式。

Method: 提出MANI-Pure框架，利用输入的幅度谱引导净化过程，自适应地应用异质性、频率目标噪声，有效抑制脆弱高频低幅度频段的对抗扰动，同时保留语义关键的低频内容。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和ImageNet-1K上的实验表明，MANI-Pure将清洁精度差距缩小到原始分类器的0.59以内，同时将鲁棒精度提升2.15，在RobustBench排行榜上达到top-1鲁棒精度，超越之前的最先进方法。

Conclusion: MANI-Pure通过频率自适应的噪声注入策略，有效解决了对抗净化中的精度-鲁棒性权衡问题，为对抗防御提供了新的有效途径。

Abstract: Adversarial purification with diffusion models has emerged as a promising
defense strategy, but existing methods typically rely on uniform noise
injection, which indiscriminately perturbs all frequencies, corrupting semantic
structures and undermining robustness. Our empirical study reveals that
adversarial perturbations are not uniformly distributed: they are predominantly
concentrated in high-frequency regions, with heterogeneous magnitude intensity
patterns that vary across frequencies and attack types. Motivated by this
observation, we introduce MANI-Pure, a magnitude-adaptive purification
framework that leverages the magnitude spectrum of inputs to guide the
purification process. Instead of injecting homogeneous noise, MANI-Pure
adaptively applies heterogeneous, frequency-targeted noise, effectively
suppressing adversarial perturbations in fragile high-frequency, low-magnitude
bands while preserving semantically critical low-frequency content. Extensive
experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet-1K validate the effectiveness of
MANI-Pure. It narrows the clean accuracy gap to within 0.59 of the original
classifier, while boosting robust accuracy by 2.15, and achieves the top-1
robust accuracy on the RobustBench leaderboard, surpassing the previous
state-of-the-art method.

Abstract: Reconstructing 3D scenes and synthesizing novel views has seen rapid progress
in recent years. Neural Radiance Fields demonstrated that continuous volumetric
radiance fields can achieve high-quality image synthesis, but their long
training and rendering times limit practicality. 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)
addressed these issues by representing scenes with millions of Gaussians,
enabling real-time rendering and fast optimization. However, Gaussian
primitives are not natively compatible with the mesh-based pipelines used in VR
headsets, and real-time graphics applications. Existing solutions attempt to
convert Gaussians into meshes through post-processing or two-stage pipelines,
which increases complexity and degrades visual quality. In this work, we
introduce Triangle Splatting+, which directly optimizes triangles, the
fundamental primitive of computer graphics, within a differentiable splatting
framework. We formulate triangle parametrization to enable connectivity through
shared vertices, and we design a training strategy that enforces opaque
triangles. The final output is immediately usable in standard graphics engines
without post-processing. Experiments on the Mip-NeRF360 and Tanks & Temples
datasets show that Triangle Splatting+achieves state-of-the-art performance in
mesh-based novel view synthesis. Our method surpasses prior splatting
approaches in visual fidelity while remaining efficient and fast to training.
Moreover, the resulting semi-connected meshes support downstream applications
such as physics-based simulation or interactive walkthroughs. The project page

TL;DR: 本文证明了分数蒸馏技术可以直接应用于文本到图像的流匹配模型，通过简单的贝叶斯规则和条件期望推导统一了高斯扩散和流匹配，并在多种DiT骨干模型上验证了SiD方法的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型生成质量高但采样速度慢，流匹配与扩散模型在理论上等价，但不确定蒸馏技术是否可以直接迁移到流匹配模型。

Method: 基于贝叶斯规则和条件期望的简单推导统一高斯扩散和流匹配，将分数身份蒸馏(SiD)扩展到预训练的文本到图像流匹配模型。

Result: 实验表明SiD方法在多种流匹配模型上开箱即用，在无数据和有数据辅助设置下都有效，无需教师微调或架构修改。

Conclusion: 分数蒸馏技术广泛适用于文本到图像流匹配模型，解决了之前关于稳定性和合理性的担忧，统一了扩散和流基生成器的加速技术。

Abstract: Diffusion models achieve high-quality image generation but are limited by
slow iterative sampling. Distillation methods alleviate this by enabling one-
or few-step generation. Flow matching, originally introduced as a distinct
framework, has since been shown to be theoretically equivalent to diffusion
under Gaussian assumptions, raising the question of whether distillation
techniques such as score distillation transfer directly. We provide a simple
derivation -- based on Bayes' rule and conditional expectations -- that unifies
Gaussian diffusion and flow matching without relying on ODE/SDE formulations.
Building on this view, we extend Score identity Distillation (SiD) to
pretrained text-to-image flow-matching models, including SANA, SD3-Medium,
SD3.5-Medium/Large, and FLUX.1-dev, all with DiT backbones. Experiments show
that, with only modest flow-matching- and DiT-specific adjustments, SiD works
out of the box across these models, in both data-free and data-aided settings,
without requiring teacher finetuning or architectural changes. This provides
the first systematic evidence that score distillation applies broadly to
text-to-image flow matching models, resolving prior concerns about stability
and soundness and unifying acceleration techniques across diffusion- and
flow-based generators. We will make the PyTorch implementation publicly
available.

TL;DR: TemMed-Bench是首个用于分析患者在不同临床就诊期间病情变化的时间医学图像基准测试，评估大型视觉语言模型在时间医学图像上的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学推理基准主要关注单次就诊图像分析，但真实临床实践中医生需要参考患者历史状况进行综合评估。

Method: 构建包含视觉问答、报告生成和图像对选择三个任务的测试集，以及超过17,000个实例的知识语料库，评估了6个专有和6个开源LVLM模型。

Result: 大多数LVLM缺乏分析时间医学图像中患者病情变化的能力，在闭卷设置下多数模型表现仅达到随机猜测水平。GPT o3、o4-mini和Claude 3.5 Sonnet表现相对较好但仍有不足。多模态检索增强比无检索和仅文本检索带来更高的性能提升。

Conclusion: 该基准揭示了LVLM在时间医学图像推理方面的局限性，并表明多模态检索增强是解决这一挑战的有前景方向。

Abstract: Existing medical reasoning benchmarks for vision-language models primarily
focus on analyzing a patient's condition based on an image from a single visit.
However, this setting deviates significantly from real-world clinical practice,
where doctors typically refer to a patient's historical conditions to provide a
comprehensive assessment by tracking their changes over time. In this paper, we
introduce TemMed-Bench, the first benchmark designed for analyzing changes in
patients' conditions between different clinical visits, which challenges large
vision-language models (LVLMs) to reason over temporal medical images.
TemMed-Bench consists of a test set comprising three tasks - visual
question-answering (VQA), report generation, and image-pair selection - and a
supplementary knowledge corpus of over 17,000 instances. With TemMed-Bench, we
conduct an evaluation of six proprietary and six open-source LVLMs. Our results
show that most LVLMs lack the ability to analyze patients' condition changes
over temporal medical images, and a large proportion perform only at a
random-guessing level in the closed-book setting. In contrast, GPT o3, o4-mini
and Claude 3.5 Sonnet demonstrate comparatively decent performance, though they
have yet to reach the desired level. Furthermore, we explore augmenting the
input with both retrieved visual and textual modalities in the medical domain.
We also show that multi-modal retrieval augmentation yields notably higher
performance gains than no retrieval and textual retrieval alone across most
models on our benchmark, with the VQA task showing an average improvement of
2.59%. Overall, we compose a benchmark grounded on real-world clinical
practice, and it reveals LVLMs' limitations in temporal medical image
reasoning, as well as highlighting the use of multi-modal retrieval
augmentation as a potentially promising direction worth exploring to address
this challenge.

*Zhaozhi Wang,Tong Zhang,Mingyue Guo,Yaowei Wang,Qixiang Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoAnchor是一个即插即用的模块，利用子空间亲和性来增强跨帧的视觉线索，无需重新训练即可显著提升多模态大语言模型在视觉空间推理任务上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型在视觉-语言对齐方面取得了显著进展，但在视觉空间推理方面仍存在局限，主要原因是注意力机制中视觉标记被语言标记所掩盖，导致模型无法跨帧一致识别相同的视觉线索。

Method: 将稀疏子空间聚类中的自表达特性与Transformer中的注意力机制建立新颖联系，提出VideoAnchor模块，利用子空间亲和性来强化跨帧视觉线索，将注意力锚定到共享的视觉结构上。

Result: 在多个基准测试和骨干模型上的实验显示性能持续提升，如在VSI-Bench和Video-MME（空间相关任务）上分别获得3.2%和4.6%的改进，定性分析显示更一致的子空间划分和更强的视觉基础。

Conclusion: VideoAnchor通过子空间亲和性有效解决了多模态大语言模型在视觉空间推理中的注意力偏差问题，为提升模型的空间理解能力提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved impressive progress in
vision-language alignment, yet they remain limited in visual-spatial reasoning.
We first identify that this limitation arises from the attention mechanism:
visual tokens are overshadowed by language tokens, preventing the model from
consistently recognizing the same visual cues across frames. To address this
challenge, we draw a novel connection between the self-expressiveness property
in sparse subspace clustering and the attention mechanism in Transformers.
Building on this insight, we propose VideoAnchor, a plug-and-play module that
leverages subspace affinities to reinforce visual cues across frames without
retraining, effectively anchoring attention to shared visual structures.
Extensive experiments across benchmarks and backbone models show consistent
performance gains -- $e.g.$, 3.2% and 4.6% improvements on VSI-Bench and
Video-MME (spatial-related tasks) with InternVL2-8B and Qwen2.5VL-72B -- while
qualitative analyses demonstrate more coherent subspace partitions and stronger
visual grounding. Our codes will be made public available at

TL;DR: GSM8K-V是一个纯视觉多图像数学推理基准，通过将文本GSM8K数据集转换为视觉形式构建，包含1319个高质量样本。评估显示现有VLM在文本GSM8K上表现饱和，但在视觉版本上仍有很大提升空间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉数学推理基准主要局限于几何问题，缺乏数学文字题覆盖，很少评估多图像推理能力。为解决这些问题，作者创建了GSM8K-V基准。

Method: 通过精心设计的自动化图像生成流程结合人工标注，将广泛使用的文本GSM8K数据集系统地映射为视觉形式，构建了1319个高质量样本。

Result: 评估显示现有VLM在文本GSM8K上接近饱和（如Gemini-2.5-Pro达95.22%），但在GSM8K-V上表现显著下降（仅46.93%），表明视觉数学推理仍有很大改进空间。

Conclusion: GSM8K-V为视觉数学推理提供了新视角，建立了指导开发更鲁棒和可泛化VLM的基准，揭示了当前模型在视觉推理方面的局限性。

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) achieve unified modeling of images and text,
enabling them to accomplish complex real-world tasks through perception,
planning, and reasoning. Among these tasks, reasoning is particularly
representative, with mathematical reasoning serving as a prominent example. It
highlights the high-level capability of VLMs to comprehend mathematical
information in images and to perform sophisticated reasoning. Recently,
numerous visual mathematical reasoning benchmarks have been proposed, but they
are often restricted to geometry, lack coverage of math word problems, and
rarely assess reasoning across multiple images. To address these gaps, we
introduce GSM8K-V, a purely visual multi-image mathematical reasoning
benchmark. GSM8K-V is built by systematically mapping each sample from the
widely used text-based GSM8K into visual form. Through a carefully designed
automated image-generation pipeline combined with meticulous human annotation,
we curate 1,319 high-quality samples. We evaluate a wide range of open-source
and closed-source models on GSM8K-V. Results show that although existing VLMs
have nearly saturated performance on text-based GSM8K, there remains
substantial room for improvement on GSM8K-V. For example, the best-performing
model, Gemini-2.5-Pro, achieves 95.22% accuracy on GSM8K but only 46.93% on
GSM8K-V. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of GSM8K-V, examining the
limitations of current models as well as potential directions for improvement.
GSM8K-V offers a new perspective on visual mathematical reasoning and
establishes a benchmark to guide the development of more robust and
generalizable VLMs.

TL;DR: 提出Rolling Forcing方法，通过联合去噪、注意力池和高效训练算法，解决流式视频生成中的误差累积问题，实现实时生成长视频


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有流式视频生成方法存在严重误差累积问题，导致长时生成视频质量显著下降，需要解决这一关键挑战

Method: 1. 联合去噪方案：同时处理多帧，缓解严格因果性；2. 注意力池机制：保持初始帧作为全局上下文锚点；3. 高效训练算法：在扩展去噪窗口上进行少步蒸馏

Result: 在单GPU上实现实时流式生成多分钟视频，显著减少误差累积

Conclusion: Rolling Forcing方法有效解决了流式视频生成中的误差累积问题，为交互式世界模型和神经游戏引擎提供了高质量、低延迟的长视频生成能力

Abstract: Streaming video generation, as one fundamental component in interactive world
models and neural game engines, aims to generate high-quality, low-latency, and
temporally coherent long video streams. However, most existing work suffers
from severe error accumulation that often significantly degrades the generated
stream videos over long horizons. We design Rolling Forcing, a novel video
generation technique that enables streaming long videos with minimal error
accumulation. Rolling Forcing comes with three novel designs. First, instead of
iteratively sampling individual frames, which accelerates error propagation, we
design a joint denoising scheme that simultaneously denoises multiple frames
with progressively increasing noise levels. This design relaxes the strict
causality across adjacent frames, effectively suppressing error growth. Second,
we introduce the attention sink mechanism into the long-horizon stream video
generation task, which allows the model to keep key value states of initial
frames as a global context anchor and thereby enhances long-term global
consistency. Third, we design an efficient training algorithm that enables
few-step distillation over largely extended denoising windows. This algorithm
operates on non-overlapping windows and mitigates exposure bias conditioned on
self-generated histories. Extensive experiments show that Rolling Forcing
enables real-time streaming generation of multi-minute videos on a single GPU,
with substantially reduced error accumulation.

TL;DR: 提出一种将预训练视觉编码器对齐为潜在扩散模型tokenizer的方法，通过三阶段对齐策略建立语义丰富的图像tokenizer，加速扩散模型收敛并提升生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统从零训练VAE主要关注低层细节，而预训练基础编码器具有丰富的语义结构，可以更好地服务于图像生成任务。

Method: 三阶段对齐策略：1) 冻结编码器，训练适配器和解码器建立语义潜在空间；2) 联合优化所有组件并添加语义保持损失；3) 精炼解码器提升重建质量。

Result: 在ImageNet 256×256上，tokenizer加速扩散模型收敛，64个epoch内达到gFID 1.90；在LAION数据集上，2B参数文本到图像模型优于FLUX VAE。

Conclusion: 该方法简单、可扩展，为连续tokenizer设计建立了语义基础范式。

Abstract: In this work, we propose aligning pretrained visual encoders to serve as
tokenizers for latent diffusion models in image generation. Unlike training a
variational autoencoder (VAE) from scratch, which primarily emphasizes
low-level details, our approach leverages the rich semantic structure of
foundation encoders. We introduce a three-stage alignment strategy: (1) freeze
the encoder and train an adapter and a decoder to establish a semantic latent
space; (2) jointly optimize all components with an additional semantic
preservation loss, enabling the encoder to capture perceptual details while
retaining high-level semantics; and (3) refine the decoder for improved
reconstruction quality. This alignment yields semantically rich image
tokenizers that benefit diffusion models. On ImageNet 256$\times$256, our
tokenizer accelerates the convergence of diffusion models, reaching a gFID of
1.90 within just 64 epochs, and improves generation both with and without
classifier-free guidance. Scaling to LAION, a 2B-parameter text-to-image model
trained with our tokenizer consistently outperforms FLUX VAE under the same
training steps. Overall, our method is simple, scalable, and establishes a
semantically grounded paradigm for continuous tokenizer design.

TL;DR: PICO是一个基于扩散变换器的视觉上下文学习框架，通过单个标注示例就能推断并应用变换，无需重新训练，实现了灵活的用户个性化视觉任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉模型在预定义任务上表现良好，但在用户自定义的个性化任务上表现不佳。现有个性化方法依赖昂贵的微调或合成数据管道，缺乏灵活性。

Method: 提出PICO四面板框架，将扩散变换器重新用作视觉上下文学习器。构建VisRel多样化调优数据集，并引入注意力引导的种子评分器来提高推理可靠性。

Result: PICO在实验中超越了微调和合成数据基线方法，能够灵活适应新颖的用户定义任务，并在识别和生成任务上都展现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 任务多样性而非规模驱动了鲁棒的泛化能力，PICO为开放式的视觉个性化任务提供了一种高效且灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Modern vision models, trained on large-scale annotated datasets, excel at
predefined tasks but struggle with personalized vision -- tasks defined at test
time by users with customized objects or novel objectives. Existing
personalization approaches rely on costly fine-tuning or synthetic data
pipelines, which are inflexible and restricted to fixed task formats. Visual
in-context learning (ICL) offers a promising alternative, yet prior methods
confine to narrow, in-domain tasks and fail to generalize to open-ended
personalization. We introduce Personalized In-Context Operator (PICO), a simple
four-panel framework that repurposes diffusion transformers as visual
in-context learners. Given a single annotated exemplar, PICO infers the
underlying transformation and applies it to new inputs without retraining. To
enable this, we construct VisRel, a compact yet diverse tuning dataset, showing
that task diversity, rather than scale, drives robust generalization. We
further propose an attention-guided seed scorer that improves reliability via
efficient inference scaling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PICO (i)
surpasses fine-tuning and synthetic-data baselines, (ii) flexibly adapts to
novel user-defined tasks, and (iii) generalizes across both recognition and
generation.

TL;DR: 提出Layer Contrastive Decoding (LayerCD)方法，通过对比视觉编码器浅层和深层特征生成的输出分布来过滤多模态大语言模型的幻觉问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型经常产生与输入图像上下文不一致的幻觉输出，包括对象、属性和关系的不准确描述

Method: LayerCD方法对比视觉编码器浅层和深层特征生成的输出分布，利用浅层视觉特征更容易导致幻觉的观察结果

Result: 在两个幻觉基准测试上显著优于当前最先进方法

Conclusion: LayerCD是一种简单有效的减少多模态大语言模型幻觉的方法

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown impressive perception and
reasoning capabilities, yet they often suffer from hallucinations -- generating
outputs that are linguistically coherent but inconsistent with the context of
the input image, including inaccuracies in objects, attributes, and relations.
To address this challenge, we propose a simple approach called Layer
Contrastive Decoding (LayerCD). Our design is motivated by the observation that
shallow visual features are much more likely than deep visual features to cause
an MLLM to hallucinate as they only capture biased, low-level information that
is insufficient for high-level reasoning. Therefore, LayerCD aims to filter out
hallucinations by contrasting the output distributions generated from visual
features of different levels, specifically those from the shallow and deep
layers of the vision encoder, respectively. We conduct extensive experiments on
two hallucination benchmarks and show that LayerCD significantly outperforms
current state-of-the-art. The code for LayerCD is available at
https://github.com/maifoundations/LayerCD .

TL;DR: GHOST是一种自动生成诱导多模态大语言模型产生物体幻觉图像的方法，通过优化图像嵌入空间来误导模型，同时保持目标对象实际不存在，从而测试和缓解模型的幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型存在物体幻觉问题，但现有基准测试使用固定视觉场景，无法发现模型特定或意外的幻觉漏洞。需要一种主动生成诱导幻觉图像的方法来全面测试模型。

Method: GHOST在图像嵌入空间进行优化，误导模型感知不存在的对象，然后引导扩散模型基于优化后的嵌入生成自然图像。该方法完全自动，无需人工监督或先验知识。

Result: 在包括GLM-4.1V-Thinking在内的多个模型上，GHOST实现了超过28%的幻觉成功率，远高于之前数据驱动方法的约1%。生成的图像质量高且确实不包含目标对象。

Conclusion: GHOST不仅能有效诊断多模态模型的幻觉漏洞，还能通过在其生成的图像上进行微调来缓解幻觉问题，是构建更可靠多模态系统的诊断和校正工具。

Abstract: Object hallucination in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) is a
persistent failure mode that causes the model to perceive objects absent in the
image. This weakness of MLLMs is currently studied using static benchmarks with
fixed visual scenarios, which preempts the possibility of uncovering
model-specific or unanticipated hallucination vulnerabilities. We introduce
GHOST (Generating Hallucinations via Optimizing Stealth Tokens), a method
designed to stress-test MLLMs by actively generating images that induce
hallucination. GHOST is fully automatic and requires no human supervision or
prior knowledge. It operates by optimizing in the image embedding space to
mislead the model while keeping the target object absent, and then guiding a
diffusion model conditioned on the embedding to generate natural-looking
images. The resulting images remain visually natural and close to the original
input, yet introduce subtle misleading cues that cause the model to
hallucinate. We evaluate our method across a range of models, including
reasoning models like GLM-4.1V-Thinking, and achieve a hallucination success
rate exceeding 28%, compared to around 1% in prior data-driven discovery
methods. We confirm that the generated images are both high-quality and
object-free through quantitative metrics and human evaluation. Also, GHOST
uncovers transferable vulnerabilities: images optimized for Qwen2.5-VL induce
hallucinations in GPT-4o at a 66.5% rate. Finally, we show that fine-tuning on
our images mitigates hallucination, positioning GHOST as both a diagnostic and
corrective tool for building more reliable multimodal systems.

TL;DR: DC-Gen是一个通过深度压缩潜在空间来加速文本到图像扩散模型的通用框架，无需从头训练即可显著提升高分辨率图像生成效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到图像扩散模型在生成高质量图像方面表现出色，但在扩展到高分辨率（如4K图像生成）时面临显著效率挑战，且现有研究很少处理潜在空间内的固有冗余问题。

Method: DC-Gen采用后训练管道，首先通过轻量级嵌入对齐训练弥合基础模型潜在空间与深度压缩潜在空间之间的表示差距，然后仅需少量LoRA微调即可解锁基础模型的生成质量。

Result: 在SANA和FLUX.1-Krea上验证了DC-Gen的有效性，DC-Gen-FLUX在NVIDIA H100 GPU上将4K图像生成延迟降低了53倍，结合NVFP4 SVDQuant后，在单张NVIDIA 5090 GPU上仅需3.5秒生成4K图像，相比基础FLUX.1-Krea模型总延迟降低138倍。

Conclusion: DC-Gen框架能够在保持基础模型质量的同时，显著加速文本到图像扩散模型，为高分辨率图像生成提供了高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Existing text-to-image diffusion models excel at generating high-quality
images, but face significant efficiency challenges when scaled to high
resolutions, like 4K image generation. While previous research accelerates
diffusion models in various aspects, it seldom handles the inherent redundancy
within the latent space. To bridge this gap, this paper introduces DC-Gen, a
general framework that accelerates text-to-image diffusion models by leveraging
a deeply compressed latent space. Rather than a costly training-from-scratch
approach, DC-Gen uses an efficient post-training pipeline to preserve the
quality of the base model. A key challenge in this paradigm is the
representation gap between the base model's latent space and a deeply
compressed latent space, which can lead to instability during direct
fine-tuning. To overcome this, DC-Gen first bridges the representation gap with
a lightweight embedding alignment training. Once the latent embeddings are
aligned, only a small amount of LoRA fine-tuning is needed to unlock the base
model's inherent generation quality. We verify DC-Gen's effectiveness on SANA
and FLUX.1-Krea. The resulting DC-Gen-SANA and DC-Gen-FLUX models achieve
quality comparable to their base models but with a significant speedup.
Specifically, DC-Gen-FLUX reduces the latency of 4K image generation by 53x on
the NVIDIA H100 GPU. When combined with NVFP4 SVDQuant, DC-Gen-FLUX generates a
4K image in just 3.5 seconds on a single NVIDIA 5090 GPU, achieving a total
latency reduction of 138x compared to the base FLUX.1-Krea model. Code:

Conclusion: DC-VideoGen为视频生成模型提供了高效的后训练加速方案，显著提升推理效率并扩展了高分辨率视频生成能力。

Abstract: We introduce DC-VideoGen, a post-training acceleration framework for
efficient video generation. DC-VideoGen can be applied to any pre-trained video
diffusion model, improving efficiency by adapting it to a deep compression
latent space with lightweight fine-tuning. The framework builds on two key
innovations: (i) a Deep Compression Video Autoencoder with a novel chunk-causal
temporal design that achieves 32x/64x spatial and 4x temporal compression while
preserving reconstruction quality and generalization to longer videos; and (ii)
AE-Adapt-V, a robust adaptation strategy that enables rapid and stable transfer
of pre-trained models into the new latent space. Adapting the pre-trained
Wan-2.1-14B model with DC-VideoGen requires only 10 GPU days on the NVIDIA H100
GPU. The accelerated models achieve up to 14.8x lower inference latency than

Motivation: 现有方法难以处理包含显著对象变形、大尺度相机运动和有限视角覆盖的长视频序列，需要一种更鲁棒的3D重建方法。

Method: 训练个性化的对象中心姿态估计器，通过预训练的图像到3D模型进行监督，指导可变形3D高斯表示的优化，并使用长期2D点跟踪进行正则化。

Result: 在挑战性场景中表现出鲁棒性和良好泛化能力，能够重建高保真、可关节化的3D表示，且与类别无关。

Conclusion: PAD3R在动态场景理解和3D内容创建方面具有潜力，为处理复杂变形场景提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We present PAD3R, a method for reconstructing deformable 3D objects from
casually captured, unposed monocular videos. Unlike existing approaches, PAD3R
handles long video sequences featuring substantial object deformation,
large-scale camera movement, and limited view coverage that typically challenge
conventional systems. At its core, our approach trains a personalized,
object-centric pose estimator, supervised by a pre-trained image-to-3D model.
This guides the optimization of deformable 3D Gaussian representation. The
optimization is further regularized by long-term 2D point tracking over the
entire input video. By combining generative priors and differentiable
rendering, PAD3R reconstructs high-fidelity, articulated 3D representations of
objects in a category-agnostic way. Extensive qualitative and quantitative
results show that PAD3R is robust and generalizes well across challenging
scenarios, highlighting its potential for dynamic scene understanding and 3D
content creation.

Conclusion: PixelCraft通过高保真图像处理和灵活推理机制，有效解决了结构化图像推理中的关键挑战，为复杂视觉任务提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Structured images (e.g., charts and geometric diagrams) remain challenging
for multimodal large language models (MLLMs), as perceptual slips can cascade
into erroneous conclusions. Intermediate visual cues can steer reasoning;
however, existing cue-based methods are constrained with low-fidelity image
processing and linear, rigid reasoning patterns, limiting their effectiveness
on complex structured-image tasks. In this paper, we propose PixelCraft, a
novel multi-agent system for high-fidelity image processing and flexible visual
reasoning on structured images. The system comprises a dispatcher, a planner, a
reasoner, critics, and a set of visual tool agents. To achieve high-fidelity
processing, we construct a high-quality corpus and fine-tune an MLLM into a
grounding model, whose pixel-level localizations are integrated with
traditional computer vision (CV) algorithms in tool agents. Building on this
foundation, PixelCraft facilitates flexible visual reasoning through a dynamic
three-stage workflow of tool selection, agent discussion, and self-criticism.
Moreover, unlike prior linear reasoning patterns that simply append historical
images, PixelCraft maintains an image memory to allow the planner to adaptively
revisit earlier visual steps, explore alternative reasoning branches, and
dynamically adjust the reasoning trajectory during discussion. Extensive
experiments on challenging chart and geometry benchmarks demonstrate that
PixelCraft significantly improves visual reasoning performance for advanced
MLLMs, setting a new standard for structured image reasoning. Our code will be
available at https://github.com/microsoft/PixelCraft.

Method: FlashI2V包含两个核心组件：1）潜在位移 - 通过从噪声潜在中减去条件图像信息来修改流匹配的源和目标分布；2）傅里叶引导 - 使用傅里叶变换获得的高频幅度特征来加速收敛并调整生成视频的细节水平。

Result: 实验结果显示FlashI2V有效克服了条件图像泄漏，在Vbench-I2V上动态度得分为53.01，仅用1.3B参数就超越了CogVideoX1.5-5B-I2V和Wan2.1-I2V-14B-480P。

Conclusion: FlashI2V通过创新的潜在位移和傅里叶引导机制，成功解决了I2V生成中的条件图像泄漏问题，在域外数据上实现了最佳泛化性能。

Abstract: In Image-to-Video (I2V) generation, a video is created using an input image
as the first-frame condition. Existing I2V methods concatenate the full
information of the conditional image with noisy latents to achieve high
fidelity. However, the denoisers in these methods tend to shortcut the
conditional image, which is known as conditional image leakage, leading to
performance degradation issues such as slow motion and color inconsistency. In
this work, we further clarify that conditional image leakage leads to
overfitting to in-domain data and decreases the performance in out-of-domain
scenarios. Moreover, we introduce Fourier-Guided Latent Shifting I2V, named
FlashI2V, to prevent conditional image leakage. Concretely, FlashI2V consists
of: (1) Latent Shifting. We modify the source and target distributions of flow
matching by subtracting the conditional image information from the noisy
latents, thereby incorporating the condition implicitly. (2) Fourier Guidance.
We use high-frequency magnitude features obtained by the Fourier Transform to
accelerate convergence and enable the adjustment of detail levels in the
generated video. Experimental results show that our method effectively
overcomes conditional image leakage and achieves the best generalization and
performance on out-of-domain data among various I2V paradigms. With only 1.3B
parameters, FlashI2V achieves a dynamic degree score of 53.01 on Vbench-I2V,
surpassing CogVideoX1.5-5B-I2V and Wan2.1-I2V-14B-480P. Github page:

TL;DR: Visual Jigsaw是一个自监督的后训练框架，通过视觉拼图任务增强多模态大语言模型的视觉理解能力，无需额外标注或视觉生成组件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型的后训练主要基于文本，视觉输入仅用于提取稀疏线索。需要开发更注重视觉理解的后训练方法。

Method: 将视觉输入分割、打乱，要求模型用自然语言输出正确排列顺序，与可验证奖励的强化学习自然对齐。

Result: 在图像、视频和3D数据上的实验显示，在细粒度感知、时序推理和3D空间理解方面有显著提升。

Conclusion: 自监督视觉中心任务在后训练多模态大语言模型中具有巨大潜力，有望推动更多视觉中心预训练设计的研究。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning based post-training has recently emerged as a powerful
paradigm for enhancing the alignment and reasoning capabilities of multimodal
large language models (MLLMs). While vision-centric post-training is crucial
for enhancing MLLMs' intrinsic understanding of visual signals, current
post-training paradigms are predominantly text-centric, where dense visual
inputs are only leveraged to extract sparse cues for text-based reasoning.
There exist a few approaches in this direction, however, they often still rely
on text as an intermediate mediator or introduce additional visual generative
designs. In this work, we introduce Visual Jigsaw, a generic self-supervised
post-training framework designed to strengthen visual understanding in MLLMs.
Visual Jigsaw is formulated as a general ordering task: visual inputs are
partitioned, shuffled, and the model must reconstruct the visual information by
producing the correct permutation in natural language. This naturally aligns
with reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards (RLVR), requires no
additional visual generative components, and derives its supervisory signal
automatically without any annotations. We instantiate Visual Jigsaw across
three visual modalities, including images, videos, and 3D data. Extensive
experiments demonstrate substantial improvements in fine-grained perception,
temporal reasoning, and 3D spatial understanding. Our findings highlight the
potential of self-supervised vision-centric tasks in post-training MLLMs and
aim to inspire further research on vision-centric pretext designs. Project

Abstract: We study the problem of applying 3D Foundation Models (3DFMs) to dense Novel
View Synthesis (NVS). Despite significant progress in Novel View Synthesis
powered by NeRF and 3DGS, current approaches remain reliant on accurate 3D
attributes (e.g., camera poses and point clouds) acquired from
Structure-from-Motion (SfM), which is often slow and fragile in low-texture or
low-overlap captures. Recent 3DFMs showcase orders of magnitude speedup over
the traditional pipeline and great potential for online NVS. But most of the
validation and conclusions are confined to sparse-view settings. Our study
reveals that naively scaling 3DFMs to dense views encounters two fundamental
barriers: dramatically increasing VRAM burden and imperfect outputs that
degrade initialization-sensitive 3D training. To address these barriers, we
introduce VGGT-X, incorporating a memory-efficient VGGT implementation that
scales to 1,000+ images, an adaptive global alignment for VGGT output
enhancement, and robust 3DGS training practices. Extensive experiments show
that these measures substantially close the fidelity gap with
COLMAP-initialized pipelines, achieving state-of-the-art results in dense
COLMAP-free NVS and pose estimation. Additionally, we analyze the causes of
remaining gaps with COLMAP-initialized rendering, providing insights for the
future development of 3D foundation models and dense NVS. Our project page is

Abstract: Accurate localization is crucial for effectively operating mobile robots in
indoor environments. This paper presents a comprehensive approach to mobile
robot localization by integrating an ultrasound-based indoor positioning system
(IPS) with wheel odometry data via sensor fusion techniques. The fusion
methodology leverages the strengths of both IPS and wheel odometry,
compensating for the individual limitations of each method. The Extended Kalman
Filter (EKF) fusion method combines the data from the IPS sensors and the
robot's wheel odometry, providing a robust and reliable localization solution.
Extensive experiments in a controlled indoor environment reveal that the
fusion-based localization system significantly enhances accuracy and precision
compared to standalone systems. The results demonstrate significant
improvements in trajectory tracking, with the EKF-based approach reducing
errors associated with wheel slippage and sensor noise.

Abstract: This paper introduces a proposed control method for autonomous personal
mobility vehicles, specifically the Single-passenger Electric Autonomous
Transporter (SEATER), using Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC). The
proposed method leverages a single-shooting approach to solve the optimal
control problem (OCP) via non-linear programming (NLP). The proposed NMPC is
implemented to a non-holonomic vehicle with a differential drive system, using
odometry data as localization feedback to guide the vehicle towards its target
pose while achieving objectives and adhering to constraints, such as obstacle
avoidance. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, a number of
simulations have been conducted in both obstacle-free and static obstacle
environments. The SEATER model and testing environment have been developed in
the Gazebo Simulation and the NMPC are implemented within the Robot Operating
System (ROS) framework. The simulation results demonstrate that the NMPC-based
approach successfully controls the vehicle to reach the desired target location
while satisfying the imposed constraints. Furthermore, this study highlights
the robustness and real-time effectiveness of NMPC with a single-shooting
approach for autonomous vehicle control in the evaluated scenarios.

Motivation: 解决SE(3)-等变扩散模型在非结构化环境中推理时间成本高的问题，同时保持数据效率和鲁棒性

Method: 将整流流引入SE(3)-扩散模型，使用SE(3)-等变网络保持旋转和平移对称性，实现快速、测地线一致的最优策略生成

Result: 仅需一步推理即可在模拟基准测试中优于基线方法，在绘画任务上减少48.5%误差，在旋转三角形任务上减少21.9%误差

Conclusion: 该方法结合了SE(3)等变性和整流流的优势，为生成策略学习模型的实际应用提供了数据和推理效率

Abstract: Robotic manipulation in unstructured environments requires the generation of
robust and long-horizon trajectory-level policy with conditions of perceptual
observations and benefits from the advantages of SE(3)-equivariant diffusion
models that are data-efficient. However, these models suffer from the inference
time costs. Inspired by the inference efficiency of rectified flows, we
introduce the rectification to the SE(3)-diffusion models and propose the
ReSeFlow, i.e., Rectifying SE(3)-Equivariant Policy Learning Flows, providing
fast, geodesic-consistent, least-computational policy generation. Crucially,
both components employ SE(3)-equivariant networks to preserve rotational and
translational symmetry, enabling robust generalization under rigid-body
motions. With the verification on the simulated benchmarks, we find that the
proposed ReSeFlow with only one inference step can achieve better performance
with lower geodesic distance than the baseline methods, achieving up to a 48.5%
error reduction on the painting task and a 21.9% reduction on the rotating
triangle task compared to the baseline's 100-step inference. This method takes
advantages of both SE(3) equivariance and rectified flow and puts it forward
for the real-world application of generative policy learning models with the
data and inference efficiency.

Abstract: Intelligent agents often require collaborative strategies to achieve complex
tasks beyond individual capabilities in real-world scenarios. While existing
audio-visual navigation (AVN) research mainly focuses on single-agent systems,
their limitations emerge in dynamic 3D environments where rapid multi-agent
coordination is critical, especially for time-sensitive applications like
emergency response. This paper introduces MASTAVN (Multi-Agent Scalable
Transformer Audio-Visual Navigation), a scalable framework enabling two agents
to collaboratively localize and navigate toward an audio target in shared 3D
environments. By integrating cross-agent communication protocols and joint
audio-visual fusion mechanisms, MASTAVN enhances spatial reasoning and temporal
synchronization. Through rigorous evaluation in photorealistic 3D simulators
(Replica and Matterport3D), MASTAVN achieves significant reductions in task
completion time and notable improvements in navigation success rates compared
to single-agent and non-collaborative baselines. This highlights the essential
role of spatiotemporal coordination in multi-agent systems. Our findings
validate MASTAVN's effectiveness in time-sensitive emergency scenarios and
establish a paradigm for advancing scalable multi-agent embodied intelligence
in complex 3D environments.

Motivation: 随着3D集成电路设计复杂度增加，有效的空间规划对于减少死区空间和确保布局质量变得至关重要，传统EDA方法面临扩展性挑战。

Method: 使用开源大语言模型，基于后序切片树表示法进行微调，在大型合成数据集上训练，并在MCNC衍生3D基准上进行评估。

Result: 实验结果显示该框架在运行效率、合法性和死区空间减少之间达到良好平衡，在实用运行预算下，相当部分测试案例实现了零死区空间布局，并能泛化到MCNC案例。

Conclusion: 基于LLM的空间规划可以作为传统EDA方法的数据驱动补充，为可扩展的3D布局生成提供新思路，并具有跨领域应用潜力。

Abstract: Three-dimensional integrated circuits (3D ICs) have emerged as a promising
solution to the scaling limits of two-dimensional designs, offering higher
integration density, shorter interconnects, and improved performance. As design
complexity increases, effective space planning becomes essential to reduce dead
space and ensure layout quality. This study investigates the use of large
language models (LLMs) for 3D IC space planning through a post-order slicing
tree representation, which guarantees legal space plans while aiming to
minimize dead space. Open-source LLMs were fine-tuned on large-scale synthetic
datasets and further evaluated on MCNC-derived 3D benchmarks. Experimental
results indicate that the proposed framework achieves a favorable balance
between runtime efficiency, legality, and dead-space reduction, with
zero-dead-space layouts obtained in a significant portion of test cases under
practical runtime budgets. Beyond synthetic benchmarks, the method generalizes
to MCNC cases such as ami33 and ami49, though larger and irregular instances
remain challenging. The approach also shows potential for cross-domain
applications, including logistics and 3D object placement, where spatial
efficiency is critical. Overall, the results suggest that LLM-based space
planning can serve as a data-driven complement to traditional electronic design
automation (EDA) methods, providing new insights for scalable 3D layout
generation.

Abstract: Safe autonomous driving requires both accurate HD map construction and
persistent awareness of traffic rules, even when their associated signs are no
longer visible. However, existing methods either focus solely on geometric
elements or treat rules as temporary classifications, failing to capture their
persistent effectiveness across extended driving sequences. In this paper, we
present PAMR (Persistent Autoregressive Mapping with Traffic Rules), a novel
framework that performs autoregressive co-construction of lane vectors and
traffic rules from visual observations. Our approach introduces two key
mechanisms: Map-Rule Co-Construction for processing driving scenes in temporal
segments, and Map-Rule Cache for maintaining rule consistency across these
segments. To properly evaluate continuous and consistent map generation, we
develop MapDRv2, featuring improved lane geometry annotations. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that PAMR achieves superior performance in joint
vector-rule mapping tasks, while maintaining persistent rule effectiveness
throughout extended driving sequences.

Abstract: Ensuring safe and effective collaboration between humans and autonomous
legged robots is a fundamental challenge in shared autonomy, particularly for
teleoperated systems navigating cluttered environments. Conventional
shared-control approaches often rely on fixed blending strategies that fail to
capture the dynamics of legged locomotion and may compromise safety. This paper
presents a teleoperator-aware, safety-critical, adaptive nonlinear model
predictive control (ANMPC) framework for shared autonomy of quadrupedal robots
in obstacle-avoidance tasks. The framework employs a fixed arbitration weight
between human and robot actions but enhances this scheme by modeling the human
input with a noisily rational Boltzmann model, whose parameters are adapted
online using a projected gradient descent (PGD) law from observed joystick
commands. Safety is enforced through control barrier function (CBF) constraints
integrated into a computationally efficient NMPC, ensuring forward invariance
of safe sets despite uncertainty in human behavior. The control architecture is
hierarchical: a high-level CBF-based ANMPC (10 Hz) generates blended
human-robot velocity references, a mid-level dynamics-aware NMPC (60 Hz)
enforces reduced-order single rigid body (SRB) dynamics to track these
references, and a low-level nonlinear whole-body controller (500 Hz) imposes
the full-order dynamics via quadratic programming to track the mid-level
trajectories. Extensive numerical and hardware experiments, together with a
user study, on a Unitree Go2 quadrupedal robot validate the framework,
demonstrating real-time obstacle avoidance, online learning of human intent
parameters, and safe teleoperator collaboration.

Abstract: Accurate parameter identification of a subject-specific human musculoskeletal
model is crucial to the development of safe and reliable physically
collaborative robotic systems, for instance, assistive exoskeletons.
Electromyography (EMG)-based parameter identification methods have demonstrated
promising performance for personalized musculoskeletal modeling, whereas their
applicability is limited by the difficulty of measuring deep muscle EMGs
invasively. Although several strategies have been proposed to reconstruct deep
muscle EMGs or activations for parameter identification, their reliability and
robustness are limited by assumptions about the deep muscle behavior. In this
work, we proposed an approach to simultaneously identify the bone and
superficial muscle parameters of a human arm musculoskeletal model without
reconstructing the deep muscle EMGs. This is achieved by only using the
least-squares solution of the deep muscle forces to calculate a loss gradient
with respect to the model parameters for identifying them in a framework of
differentiable optimization. The results of extensive comparative simulations
manifested that our proposed method can achieve comparable estimation accuracy
compared to a similar method, but with all the muscle EMGs available.

TL;DR: 提出动态缓冲区规划原语，通过形成可移动的临时堆栈来提升机器人重排任务的效率和可行性，在密集和大型场景中分别减少11.89%和5.69%的机械臂移动成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统规划器在杂乱桌面环境中重排物体时效率低下，使用固定缓冲区导致高成本计划。静态堆栈限制了效率，因为基座物体一旦支撑其他物体就无法移动。

Method: 引入动态缓冲区规划原语，受人类分组策略启发，允许机器人形成临时的可移动堆栈，这些堆栈可以作为整体运输，提高规划效率和可行性。

Result: 与最先进的重排规划器相比，在密集场景中减少11.89%的机械臂移动成本，在大型低密度场景中减少5.69%的成本。在Delta并联机器人上验证了实用性。

Conclusion: 动态缓冲是成本高效和鲁棒重排规划的关键原语，能显著改善密集和大型环境中的规划性能。

Abstract: Rearranging objects in cluttered tabletop environments remains a
long-standing challenge in robotics. Classical planners often generate
inefficient, high-cost plans by shuffling objects individually and using fixed
buffers--temporary spaces such as empty table regions or static stacks--to
resolve conflicts. When only free table locations are used as buffers, dense
scenes become inefficient, since placing an object can restrict others from
reaching their goals and complicate planning. Allowing stacking provides extra
buffer capacity, but conventional stacking is static: once an object supports
another, the base cannot be moved, which limits efficiency. To overcome these
issues, a novel planning primitive called the Dynamic Buffer is introduced.
Inspired by human grouping strategies, it enables robots to form temporary,
movable stacks that can be transported as a unit. This improves both
feasibility and efficiency in dense layouts, and it also reduces travel in
large-scale settings where space is abundant. Compared with a state-of-the-art
rearrangement planner, the approach reduces manipulator travel cost by 11.89%
in dense scenarios with a stationary robot and by 5.69% in large, low-density
settings with a mobile manipulator. Practicality is validated through
experiments on a Delta parallel robot with a two-finger gripper. These findings
establish dynamic buffering as a key primitive for cost-efficient and robust

*Brandon Vu,Shameek Ganguly,Pushkar Joshi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Empart是一个交互式工具，允许用户为网格的不同区域指定不同的简化容差，通过区域特定的约束优化凸分解，显著减少凸部分数量并提升仿真性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在整个网格上应用统一的误差容差，导致在非关键区域过度细化或在关键区域细节不足，无法在精度和性能之间实现最优权衡。

Method: 利用现有凸分解算法作为子程序，采用新颖的并行化框架高效处理区域特定约束，提供带视觉反馈的用户友好界面进行迭代优化。

Result: 在固定误差阈值下，相比最先进方法(V-HACD)显著减少凸部分数量，在机器人抓取任务中将整体仿真时间减少69%。

Conclusion: 交互式、区域特定的简化对于高性能机器人应用具有重要价值，能够更好地平衡几何精度和仿真效率。

Abstract: Simplifying complex 3D meshes is a crucial step in robotics applications to
enable efficient motion planning and physics simulation. Common methods, such
as approximate convex decomposition, represent a mesh as a collection of simple
parts, which are computationally inexpensive to simulate. However, existing
approaches apply a uniform error tolerance across the entire mesh, which can
result in a sub-optimal trade-off between accuracy and performance. For
instance, a robot grasping an object needs high-fidelity geometry in the
vicinity of the contact surfaces but can tolerate a coarser simplification
elsewhere. A uniform tolerance can lead to excessive detail in non-critical
areas or insufficient detail where it's needed most.
  To address this limitation, we introduce Empart, an interactive tool that
allows users to specify different simplification tolerances for selected
regions of a mesh. Our method leverages existing convex decomposition
algorithms as a sub-routine but uses a novel, parallelized framework to handle
region-specific constraints efficiently. Empart provides a user-friendly
interface with visual feedback on approximation error and simulation
performance, enabling designers to iteratively refine their decomposition. We
demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces the number of convex parts
compared to a state-of-the-art method (V-HACD) at a fixed error threshold,
leading to substantial speedups in simulation performance. For a robotic
pick-and-place task, Empart-generated collision meshes reduced the overall
simulation time by 69% compared to a uniform decomposition, highlighting the
value of interactive, region-specific simplification for performant robotics
applications.

*Kaleb Ben Naveed,Haejoon Lee,Dimitra Panagou*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出一个两阶段多机器人场估计框架，用于处理非均匀时空环境中的场估计问题，通过变差函数驱动的规划器学习区域特定的空间长度尺度，并基于不确定性重新分配机器人。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有高斯过程方法通常假设全局长度尺度或仅周期性更新，有些允许空间变化但忽略时间变化，导致不确定性估计不准确。需要处理非均匀时空环境中不同区域具有不同时空动态的问题。

Method: 两阶段框架：第一阶段使用变差函数驱动的规划器学习区域特定的空间长度尺度；第二阶段采用分配策略，基于当前不确定性重新分配机器人，并在细化时间长度尺度时更新采样。使用清晰度作为信息度量。

Result: 在多样化环境中评估了所提方法，提供了空间长度尺度估计的收敛性分析，以及量化与oracle分配序列差距的动态遗憾边界。

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效处理非均匀时空环境中的场估计问题，通过学习区域特定的长度尺度和动态机器人分配，提高了不确定性估计的准确性。

Abstract: Autonomous robots are increasingly deployed to estimate spatiotemporal fields
(e.g., wind, temperature, gas concentration) that vary across space and time.
We consider environments divided into non-overlapping regions with distinct
spatial and temporal dynamics, termed non-uniform spatiotemporal environments.
Gaussian Processes (GPs) can be used to estimate these fields. The GP model
depends on a kernel that encodes how the field co-varies in space and time,
with its spatial and temporal lengthscales defining the correlation. Hence,
when these lengthscales are incorrect or do not correspond to the actual field,
the estimates of uncertainty can be highly inaccurate. Existing GP methods
often assume one global lengthscale or update only periodically; some allow
spatial variation but ignore temporal changes. To address these limitations, we
propose a two-phase framework for multi-robot field estimation. Phase 1 uses a
variogram-driven planner to learn region-specific spatial lengthscales. Phase 2
employs an allocation strategy that reassigns robots based on the current
uncertainty, and updates sampling as temporal lengthscales are refined. For
encoding uncertainty, we utilize clarity, an information metric from our
earlier work. We evaluate the proposed method across diverse environments and
provide convergence analysis for spatial lengthscale estimation, along with
dynamic regret bounds quantifying the gap to the oracle's allocation sequence.

*Yanwei Du,Jing-Chen Peng,Patricio A. Vela*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Good Weights算法通过自适应融合视觉SLAM和航位推算，在视觉特征弱时增加DR权重，视觉特征强时减少DR权重，实现连续准确的位姿估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉SLAM在纹理缺失或视觉退化环境中表现不佳，而机器人通常配备的航位推算传感器短期性能良好但长期不可靠，需要一种融合方案来提升SLAM的鲁棒性。

Method: 提出Good Weights框架，自适应调整视觉SLAM和航位推算的融合权重，并修改SLAM系统的所有模块来整合DR信息。

Result: 在收集的数据集和实际部署中验证了Good Weights的有效性，提高了视觉SLAM的性能和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: Good Weights为移动导航提供了一个实用的解决方案，能够在不依赖DR的情况下维持位姿跟踪，显著提升SLAM系统在挑战性环境中的表现。

Abstract: Given that Visual SLAM relies on appearance cues for localization and scene
understanding, texture-less or visually degraded environments (e.g., plain
walls or low lighting) lead to poor pose estimation and track loss. However,
robots are typically equipped with sensors that provide some form of dead
reckoning odometry with reasonable short-time performance but unreliable
long-time performance. The Good Weights (GW) algorithm described here provides
a framework to adaptively integrate dead reckoning (DR) with passive visual
SLAM for continuous and accurate frame-level pose estimation. Importantly, it
describes how all modules in a comprehensive SLAM system must be modified to
incorporate DR into its design. Adaptive weighting increases DR influence when
visual tracking is unreliable and reduces when visual feature information is
strong, maintaining pose track without overreliance on DR. Good Weights yields
a practical solution for mobile navigation that improves visual SLAM
performance and robustness. Experiments on collected datasets and in real-world
deployment demonstrate the benefits of Good Weights.

Conclusion: ARMimic实现了安全、无缝的野外数据收集，为多样化真实世界环境中的可扩展机器人学习提供了巨大潜力。

Abstract: Imitation learning is a powerful paradigm for robot skill acquisition, yet
conventional demonstration methods--such as kinesthetic teaching and
teleoperation--are cumbersome, hardware-heavy, and disruptive to workflows.
Recently, passive observation using extended reality (XR) headsets has shown
promise for egocentric demonstration collection, yet current approaches require
additional hardware, complex calibration, or constrained recording conditions
that limit scalability and usability. We present ARMimic, a novel framework
that overcomes these limitations with a lightweight and hardware-minimal setup
for scalable, robot-free data collection using only a consumer XR headset and a
stationary workplace camera. ARMimic integrates egocentric hand tracking,
augmented reality (AR) robot overlays, and real-time depth sensing to ensure
collision-aware, kinematically feasible demonstrations. A unified imitation
learning pipeline is at the core of our method, treating both human and virtual
robot trajectories as interchangeable, which enables policies that generalize
across different embodiments and environments. We validate ARMimic on two
manipulation tasks, including challenging long-horizon bowl stacking. In our
experiments, ARMimic reduces demonstration time by 50% compared to
teleoperation and improves task success by 11% over ACT, a state-of-the-art
baseline trained on teleoperated data. Our results demonstrate that ARMimic
enables safe, seamless, and in-the-wild data collection, offering great
potential for scalable robot learning in diverse real-world settings.

Conclusion: 基于差分贝叶斯滤波的轨迹合成方法在复杂赛道上的自主超车任务中表现出色，无需传统简化假设

Abstract: A significant challenge in autonomous racing is to generate overtaking
maneuvers. Racing agents must execute these maneuvers on complex racetracks
with little room for error. Optimization techniques and graph-based methods
have been proposed, but these methods often rely on oversimplified assumptions
for collision-avoidance and dynamic constraints. In this work, we present an
approach to trajectory synthesis based on an extension of the Differential
Bayesian Filtering framework. Our approach for collision-free trajectory
synthesis frames the problem as one of Bayesian Inference over the space of
Composite Bezier Curves. Our method is derivative-free, does not require a
spherical approximation of the vehicle footprint, linearization of constraints,
or simplifying upper bounds on collision avoidance. We conduct a closed-loop
analysis of DBF-MA and find it successfully overtakes an opponent in 87% of
tested scenarios, outperforming existing methods in autonomous overtaking.

Conclusion: 该自适应控制器能够有效处理人类-机器人同步任务中的通信时延问题，同时确保安全约束，为实际应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, an adaptive controller is designed for the synchronization of
the trajectory of a robot with unknown kinematics and dynamics to that of the
current human trajectory in the task space using the delayed human trajectory
information. The communication time delay may be a result of various factors
that arise in human-robot collaboration tasks, such as sensor processing or
fusion to estimate trajectory/intent, network delays, or computational
limitations. The developed adaptive controller uses Barrier Lyapunov Function
(BLF) to constrain the Cartesian coordinates of the robot to ensure safety, an
ICL-based adaptive law to account for the unknown kinematics, and a
gradient-based adaptive law to estimate unknown dynamics. Barrier
Lyapunov-Krasovskii (LK) functionals are used for the stability analysis to
show that the synchronization and parameter estimation errors remain
semi-globally uniformly ultimately bounded (SGUUB). The simulation results
based on a human-robot synchronization scenario with time delay are provided to
demonstrate the effectiveness of the designed synchronization controller with
safety constraints.

resources, robotic manipulation suffers from limited training examples. To
bridge this gap between human and robot manipulation capabilities, we propose
UniPrototype, a novel framework that enables effective knowledge transfer from
human to robot domains via shared motion primitives. ur approach makes three
key contributions: (1) We introduce a compositional prototype discovery
mechanism with soft assignments, enabling multiple primitives to co-activate
and thus capture blended and hierarchical skills; (2) We propose an adaptive
prototype selection strategy that automatically adjusts the number of
prototypes to match task complexity, ensuring scalable and efficient
representation; (3) We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through
extensive experiments in both simulation environments and real-world robotic
systems. Our results show that UniPrototype successfully transfers human
manipulation knowledge to robots, significantly improving learning efficiency
and task performance compared to existing approaches.The code and dataset will

Abstract: End-of-Life (EoL) phones significantly exacerbate global e-waste challenges
due to their high production volumes and short lifecycles. Disassembly is among
the most critical processes in EoL phone recycling. However, it relies heavily
on human labor due to product variability. Consequently, the manual process is
both labor-intensive and time-consuming. In this paper, we propose a low-cost,
easily deployable automated and selective disassembly and sorting system for
EoL phones, consisting of three subsystems: an adaptive cutting system, a
vision-based robotic sorting system, and a battery removal system. The system
can process over 120 phones per hour with an average disassembly success rate
of 98.9%, efficiently delivering selected high-value components to downstream
processing. It provides a reliable and scalable automated solution to the
pressing challenge of EoL phone disassembly. Additionally, the automated system
can enhance disassembly economics, converting a previously unprofitable process
into one that yields a net profit per unit weight of EoL phones.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) and sim-to-real transfer have advanced robotic
manipulation of rigid objects. Yet, policies remain brittle when applied to
articulated mechanisms due to contact-rich dynamics and under-modeled joint
phenomena such as friction, stiction, backlash, and clearances. We address this
challenge through dexterous in-hand manipulation of articulated tools using a
robotic hand with reduced articulation and kinematic redundancy relative to the
human hand. Our controller augments a simulation-trained base policy with a
sensor-driven refinement learned from hardware demonstrations, conditioning on
proprioception and target articulation states while fusing whole-hand tactile
and force feedback with the policy's internal action intent via
cross-attention-based integration. This design enables online adaptation to
instance-specific articulation properties, stabilizes contact interactions,
regulates internal forces, and coordinates coupled-link motion under
perturbations. We validate our approach across a diversity of real-world
examples, including scissors, pliers, minimally invasive surgical tools, and
staplers. We achieve robust transfer from simulation to hardware, improved
disturbance resilience, and generalization to previously unseen articulated
tools, thereby reducing reliance on precise physical modeling in contact-rich
settings.

Conclusion: ST-OVSG能够泛化到新类别，无需微调即可增强规划对传输延迟的鲁棒性，有效解决本地-远程状态不匹配问题。

Abstract: Teleoperation via natural-language reduces operator workload and enhances
safety in high-risk or remote settings. However, in dynamic remote scenes,
transmission latency during bidirectional communication creates gaps between
remote perceived states and operator intent, leading to command
misunderstanding and incorrect execution. To mitigate this, we introduce the
Spatio-Temporal Open-Vocabulary Scene Graph (ST-OVSG), a representation that
enriches open-vocabulary perception with temporal dynamics and lightweight
latency annotations. ST-OVSG leverages LVLMs to construct open-vocabulary 3D
object representations, and extends them into the temporal domain via Hungarian
assignment with our temporal matching cost, yielding a unified spatio-temporal
scene graph. A latency tag is embedded to enable LVLM planners to
retrospectively query past scene states, thereby resolving local-remote state
mismatches caused by transmission delays. To further reduce redundancy and
highlight task-relevant cues, we propose a task-oriented subgraph filtering
strategy that produces compact inputs for the planner. ST-OVSG generalizes to
novel categories and enhances planning robustness against transmission latency
without requiring fine-tuning. Experiments show that our method achieves 74
percent node accuracy on the Replica benchmark, outperforming ConceptGraph.
Notably, in the latency-robustness experiment, the LVLM planner assisted by
ST-OVSG achieved a planning success rate of 70.5 percent.

Abstract: In Industry 4.0 applications, dynamic environmental interference induces
highly nonlinear and strongly coupled interactions between the environmental

states through multimodal sensor data fusion remains a critical challenge in
current robotic datasets. To address this, an industrial-grade multimodal
interference dataset is presented, designed for robotic perception and control
under complex conditions. The dataset integrates multi-dimensional interference
features including size, color, and lighting variations, and employs
high-precision sensors to synchronously collect visual, torque, and joint-state
measurements. Scenarios with geometric similarity exceeding 85\% and
standardized lighting gradients are included to ensure real-world
representativeness. Microsecond-level time-synchronization and
vibration-resistant data acquisition protocols, implemented via the Robot

Experimental results demonstrate that the dataset enhances model validation
robustness and improves robotic operational stability in dynamic,
interference-rich environments. The dataset is publicly available

Abstract: Manipulator robots are increasingly being deployed in retail environments,
yet contact rich edge cases still trigger costly human teleoperation. A
prominent example is upright lying beverage bottles, where purely visual cues
are often insufficient to resolve subtle contact events required for precise
manipulation. We present a multimodal Imitation Learning policy that augments
the Action Chunking Transformer with force and torque sensing, enabling
end-to-end learning over images, joint states, and forces and torques. Deployed
on Ghost, single-arm platform by Telexistence Inc, our approach improves
Pick-and-Reorient bottle task by detecting and exploiting contact transitions
during pressing and placement. Hardware experiments demonstrate greater task
success compared to baseline matching the observation space of ACT as an
ablation and experiments indicate that force and torque signals are beneficial
in the press and place phases where visual observability is limited, supporting
the use of interaction forces as a complementary modality for contact rich
skills. The results suggest a practical path to scaling retail manipulation by
combining modern imitation learning architectures with lightweight force and
torque sensing.

Method: 使用DNN进行Wi-Fi RSSI粗定位，结合IMU动态定位和Gmapping SLAM生成占据栅格地图，最后通过EKF预测-更新融合传感器信息，抑制Wi-Fi噪声和IMU漂移。

Result: 在真实环境实验中，该框架在所有路径配置下保持稳定精度，平均2D误差为0.2449-0.3781米，远优于单独Wi-Fi RSSI（最高1.3404米）和LiDAR/IMU定位（0.6233-2.8803米）。

Conclusion: 多传感器融合框架有效抑制了单一方法的局限性，提供了稳定且高精度的室内定位性能，解决了传统方法的精度不足和成本问题。

Abstract: Conventional Wi-Fi received signal strength indicator (RSSI) fingerprinting
cannot meet the growing demand for accurate indoor localization and navigation
due to its lower accuracy, while solutions based on light detection and ranging
(LiDAR) can provide better localization performance but is limited by their
higher deployment cost and complexity. To address these issues, we propose a
novel indoor localization and navigation framework integrating Wi-Fi RSSI
fingerprinting, LiDAR-based simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), and
inertial measurement unit (IMU) navigation based on an extended Kalman filter
(EKF). Specifically, coarse localization by deep neural network (DNN)-based
Wi-Fi RSSI fingerprinting is refined by IMU-based dynamic positioning using a
Gmapping-based SLAM to generate an occupancy grid map and output high-frequency
attitude estimates, which is followed by EKF prediction-update integrating
sensor information while effectively suppressing Wi-Fi-induced noise and IMU
drift errors. Multi-group real-world experiments conducted on the IR building
at Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University demonstrates that the proposed
multi-sensor fusion framework suppresses the instability caused by individual
approaches and thereby provides stable accuracy across all path configurations
with mean two-dimensional (2D) errors ranging from 0.2449 m to 0.3781 m. In
contrast, the mean 2D errors of Wi-Fi RSSI fingerprinting reach up to 1.3404 m
in areas with severe signal interference, and those of LiDAR/IMU localization
are between 0.6233 m and 2.8803 m due to cumulative drift.

TL;DR: LAGEA框架利用视觉语言模型将语言反馈转化为强化学习的密集奖励信号，帮助机器人从错误中学习，在Meta-World MT10基准上显著提升了成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前机器人代理缺乏从自身错误中系统学习的方法，研究探索自然语言是否能作为错误推理信号，帮助具身代理诊断问题并纠正行为。

Method: LAGEA框架通过VLM生成简洁的语言总结，定位轨迹中的关键时刻，将反馈与视觉状态对齐，并将目标进展和反馈一致性转化为有界的逐步塑造奖励，使用自适应失败感知系数调节奖励影响。

Result: 在Meta-World MT10基准测试中，LAGEA相比最先进方法在随机目标上平均成功率提升9.0%，在固定目标上提升5.3%，且收敛速度更快。

Conclusion: 当语言被结构化并在时间上接地时，可以成为教导机器人自我反思错误并做出更好选择的有效机制。

Abstract: Robotic manipulation benefits from foundation models that describe goals, but
today's agents still lack a principled way to learn from their own mistakes. We
ask whether natural language can serve as feedback, an error reasoning signal
that helps embodied agents diagnose what went wrong and correct course. We
introduce LAGEA (Language Guided Embodied Agents), a framework that turns
episodic, schema-constrained reflections from a vision language model (VLM)
into temporally grounded guidance for reinforcement learning. LAGEA summarizes
each attempt in concise language, localizes the decisive moments in the
trajectory, aligns feedback with visual state in a shared representation, and
converts goal progress and feedback agreement into bounded, step-wise shaping
rewardswhose influence is modulated by an adaptive, failure-aware coefficient.
This design yields dense signals early when exploration needs direction and
gracefully recedes as competence grows. On the Meta-World MT10 embodied
manipulation benchmark, LAGEA improves average success over the
state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods by 9.0% on random goals and 5.3% on fixed
goals, while converging faster. These results support our hypothesis: language,
when structured and grounded in time, is an effective mechanism for teaching
robots to self-reflect on mistakes and make better choices. Code will be
released soon.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖启发式实时落脚点选择限制鲁棒性和适应性，或依赖计算密集的轨迹优化，难以在复杂地形和长时域中有效工作。

Method: 结合反应式合成生成构造正确的符号级控制器，使用混合整数凸规划进行动态物理可行的步态规划，采用符号修复机制减少MICP求解依赖，实时MICP重规划结合运行时符号修复和延迟感知协调。

Conclusion: 该集成规划框架成功桥接了离线合成和在线操作，在动态变化地形上实现了鲁棒的四足移动能力。

Abstract: We present an integrated planning framework for quadrupedal locomotion over
dynamically changing, unforeseen terrains. Existing methods often depend on
heuristics for real-time foothold selection-limiting robustness and
adaptability-or rely on computationally intensive trajectory optimization
across complex terrains and long horizons. In contrast, our approach combines
reactive synthesis for generating correct-by-construction symbolic-level
controllers with mixed-integer convex programming (MICP) for dynamic and
physically feasible footstep planning during each symbolic transition. To
reduce the reliance on costly MICP solves and accommodate specifications that
may be violated due to physical infeasibility, we adopt a symbolic repair
mechanism that selectively generates only the required symbolic transitions.
During execution, real-time MICP replanning based on actual terrain data,
combined with runtime symbolic repair and delay-aware coordination, enables
seamless bridging between offline synthesis and online operation. Through
extensive simulation and hardware experiments, we validate the framework's
ability to identify missing locomotion skills and respond effectively in
safety-critical environments, including scattered stepping stones and rebar
scenarios.

Motivation: 解决跨机器人形态的通用导航挑战，避免对昂贵、特定形态数据的依赖，解决规划与控制紧密耦合以及多模态决策的"灾难性平均"问题。

Method: 采用IL-then-RL两阶段方法：1) 离线训练基于条件归一化流的通用专家VelFlow，学习运动学可行动作的完整分布；2) 在线训练轻量级动态感知精炼器，补偿目标机器人的特定动态特性。

Result: 在四足、双足和四旋翼机器人上的广泛实验表明，CE-Nav实现了最先进的性能，同时大幅降低了适应成本。真实世界部署验证了其高效性和可扩展性。

Conclusion: CE-Nav提供了一个高效且可扩展的解决方案，用于构建可泛化的导航系统，成功解决了跨机器人形态的通用导航问题。

Abstract: Generalizing local navigation policies across diverse robot morphologies is a
critical challenge. Progress is often hindered by the need for costly and
embodiment-specific data, the tight coupling of planning and control, and the
"disastrous averaging" problem where deterministic models fail to capture
multi-modal decisions (e.g., turning left or right). We introduce CE-Nav, a
novel two-stage (IL-then-RL) framework that systematically decouples universal
geometric reasoning from embodiment-specific dynamic adaptation. First, we
train an embodiment-agnostic General Expert offline using imitation learning.
This expert, a conditional normalizing flow model named VelFlow, learns the
full distribution of kinematically-sound actions from a large-scale dataset
generated by a classical planner, completely avoiding real robot data and
resolving the multi-modality issue. Second, for a new robot, we freeze the
expert and use it as a guiding prior to train a lightweight, Dynamics-Aware
Refiner via online reinforcement learning. This refiner rapidly learns to
compensate for the target robot's specific dynamics and controller
imperfections with minimal environmental interaction. Extensive experiments on
quadrupeds, bipeds, and quadrotors show that CE-Nav achieves state-of-the-art
performance while drastically reducing adaptation cost. Successful real-world
deployments further validate our approach as an efficient and scalable solution
for building generalizable navigation systems.

TL;DR: 提出了一种使用模拟退火生成目标采样分布的方法，通过调整玻尔兹曼分布的冷度参数，从均匀分布逐渐过渡到估计的最优分布，以在多机器人团队中实现一致的采集质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多机器人团队主动信息采集的目标是保持各区域相对不确定性在相同水平，以实现一致的采集质量（如目标检测）。然而，观测噪声水平未知且初始估计不可靠，会导致波动值。

Method: 使用模拟退火生成目标采样分布，从均匀分布开始，通过调整玻尔兹曼分布的冷度参数，以估计的采样熵作为能量，逐渐过渡到估计的最优分布。

Result: 仿真结果显示，与均匀搜索和直接遍历搜索相比，该方法在瞬时熵和渐近熵方面都有显著改善。通过TurtleBot群系统演示验证了算法的物理适用性。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效处理未知观测噪声，在多机器人信息采集中实现一致的质量水平，并通过实验验证了其实际应用价值。

Abstract: One of the goals of active information acquisition using multi-robot teams is
to keep the relative uncertainty in each region at the same level to maintain
identical acquisition quality (e.g., consistent target detection) in all the
regions. To achieve this goal, ergodic coverage can be used to assign the
number of samples according to the quality of observation, i.e., sampling noise
levels. However, the noise levels are unknown to the robots. Although this
noise can be estimated from samples, the estimates are unreliable at first and
can generate fluctuating values. The main contribution of this paper is to use
simulated annealing to generate the target sampling distribution, starting from
uniform and gradually shifting to an estimated optimal distribution, by varying
the coldness parameter of a Boltzmann distribution with the estimated sampling
entropy as energy. Simulation results show a substantial improvement of both
transient and asymptotic entropy compared to both uniform and direct-ergodic
searches. Finally, a demonstration is performed with a TurtleBot swarm system
to validate the physical applicability of the algorithm.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: GLUE是一个用于模仿学习的全局-局部统一编码框架，通过关键补丁跟踪来解决复杂OOD环境中的视觉表示问题，显著提升了策略的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在复杂OOD环境中，全局视觉表示的注意力会被稀释或干扰，导致策略性能下降。局部表示的任务相关对象不变性提供了解決方案。

Method: GLUE采用文本引导机制选择和跟踪关键补丁作为局部表示，通过全局补丁特征查询局部补丁来提取关键信息，生成细粒度的局部特征。

Result: GLUE在仿真环境中比最强基线提升17.6%，在真实环境中提升36.3%，在真实世界泛化设置中提升58.3%。

Conclusion: GLUE通过融合全局和局部表示，将训练和测试分布对齐到相似且任务信息丰富的特征空间，显著增强了模仿学习策略的鲁棒性。

Abstract: In recent years, visual representation learning has gained widespread
attention in robotic imitation learning. However, in complex
Out-of-Distribution(OOD) settings characterized by clutter and occlusion, the
attention of global visual representations can be diluted or interfered,
leading to degraded policy performance. The invariance of local representations
for task-relevant objects offers a solution. By efficiently utilizing these
local representations, training and testing data can be mapped to a more
similar feature space, thereby mitigating the covariate shift problem.
Accordingly, we propose GLUE, a global-local unified encoding framework for
imitation learning based on key-patch tracking. GLUE selects and tracks
key-patches as critical local representations by employing a text-guided
mechanism. It features a novel fusion framework where global patch features
query local patches to distill essential information, yielding fine-grained
local features with low heterogeneity relative to the global context. This
fused representation steers the robot's visual attention toward task-relevant
objects and preserves precise global context, which together align the training
and testing distributions into a similar and task-informative feature space,
ultimately enhancing the robustness of the imitation learning policy.
Experiments demonstrate that GLUE achieves strong performance across diverse
tasks in both simulation and real-world settings, outperforming the strongest
baseline by 17.6% in simulation, 36.3% in real-world environments, and 58.3% on
real-world generalization settings. The project website of GLUE is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种切换策略框架，用于实现四足机器人的顺应性和安全运动控制，通过可调节顺应性策略和安全策略的切换来应对大扰动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有四足机器人控制方法缺乏动物所具备的自适应和可调节顺应性能力，大多数运动控制器无法提供可调顺应性且在大扰动下容易失效。

Method: 使用师生强化学习框架训练具有可调节顺应性水平的力顺应策略，开发基于捕获点概念的安全策略，并引入可恢复性网络来预测失败可能性并在两种策略间切换。

Result: 该框架使四足机器人在遭受严重外部扰动时能够同时实现力顺应性和鲁棒安全性。

Conclusion: 所提出的切换策略框架成功解决了四足机器人在大扰动下的顺应性和安全性问题，实现了类似动物的自适应能力。

Abstract: Quadruped robots are designed to achieve agile locomotion by mimicking legged
animals. However, existing control methods for quadrupeds often lack one of the
key capabilities observed in animals: adaptive and adjustable compliance in
response to external disturbances. Most locomotion controllers do not provide
tunable compliance and tend to fail under large perturbations. In this work, we
propose a switched policy framework for compliant and safe quadruped
locomotion. First, we train a force compliant policy with adjustable compliance
levels using a teacher student reinforcement learning framework, eliminating
the need for explicit force sensing. Next, we develop a safe policy based on
the capture point concept to stabilize the robot when the compliant policy
fails. Finally, we introduce a recoverability network that predicts the
likelihood of failure and switches between the compliant and safe policies.
Together, this framework enables quadruped robots to achieve both force
compliance and robust safety when subjected to severe external disturbances.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出A2C2方法，通过轻量级的实时动作块校正头来解决VLA模型动作分块导致的响应性下降问题，无需重新训练基础策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLA模型使用动作分块提高效率和时序一致性，但会损害推理延迟和长时域下的响应性。

Method: A2C2在每个控制步骤运行，结合最新观测、VLA预测动作、位置特征和基础策略特征，输出逐步骤校正。

Result: 在动态Kinetix任务套件和LIBERO Spatial上，相比RTC方法分别提升23%和7%的成功率，在零延迟长时域下也提高鲁棒性。

Conclusion: A2C2是部署高容量分块策略到实时控制的有效即插即用机制，计算开销小。

Abstract: To improve efficiency and temporal coherence, Vision-Language-Action (VLA)
models often predict action chunks; however, this action chunking harms
reactivity under inference delay and long horizons. We introduce Asynchronous
Action Chunk Correction (A2C2), which is a lightweight real-time chunk
correction head that runs every control step and adds a time-aware correction
to any off-the-shelf VLA's action chunk. The module combines the latest
observation, the predicted action from VLA (base action), a positional feature
that encodes the index of the base action within the chunk, and some features
from the base policy, then outputs a per-step correction. This preserves the
base model's competence while restoring closed-loop responsiveness. The
approach requires no retraining of the base policy and is orthogonal to
asynchronous execution schemes such as Real Time Chunking (RTC). On the dynamic
Kinetix task suite (12 tasks) and LIBERO Spatial, our method yields consistent
success rate improvements across increasing delays and execution horizons (+23%
point and +7% point respectively, compared to RTC), and also improves
robustness for long horizons even with zero injected delay. Since the
correction head is small and fast, there is minimal overhead compared to the
inference of large VLA models. These results indicate that A2C2 is an
effective, plug-in mechanism for deploying high-capacity chunking policies in
real-time control.

Result: 创建了一个标准化、可扩展和可复现的平台，支持在Gym兼容环境中进行目标识别研究。

Conclusion: 这两个开源库为推进目标识别研究提供了统一的平台，解决了领域碎片化问题。

Abstract: Goal Recognition (GR) is the task of inferring an agent's intended goal from
partial observations of its behavior, typically in an online and one-shot
setting. Despite recent advances in model-free GR, particularly in applications
such as human-robot interaction, surveillance, and assistive systems, the field
remains fragmented due to inconsistencies in benchmarks, domains, and
evaluation protocols.
  To address this, we introduce gr-libs
(https://github.com/MatanShamir1/gr_libs) and gr-envs
(https://github.com/MatanShamir1/gr_envs), two complementary open-source
frameworks that support the development, evaluation, and comparison of GR
algorithms in Gym-compatible environments. gr-libs includes modular
implementations of MDP-based GR baselines, diagnostic tools, and evaluation
utilities. gr-envs provides a curated suite of environments adapted for dynamic
and goal-directed behavior, along with wrappers that ensure compatibility with
standard reinforcement learning toolkits. Together, these libraries offer a
standardized, extensible, and reproducible platform for advancing GR research.
Both packages are open-source and available on GitHub and PyPI.

Motivation: LLMs和VLMs在机器人环境中部署时容易受到越狱攻击，绕过安全机制导致危险行为。现有的基于数据的防御方法在专业领域数据集稀缺时泛化能力不足。

Conclusion: J-DAPT为机器人应用中保护VLMs提供了实用的防御方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are
increasingly deployed in robotic environments but remain vulnerable to
jailbreaking attacks that bypass safety mechanisms and drive unsafe or
physically harmful behaviors in the real world. Data-driven defenses such as
jailbreak classifiers show promise, yet they struggle to generalize in domains
where specialized datasets are scarce, limiting their effectiveness in robotics
and other safety-critical contexts. To address this gap, we introduce J-DAPT, a
lightweight framework for multimodal jailbreak detection through
attention-based fusion and domain adaptation. J-DAPT integrates textual and
visual embeddings to capture both semantic intent and environmental grounding,
while aligning general-purpose jailbreak datasets with domain-specific
reference data. Evaluations across autonomous driving, maritime robotics, and
quadruped navigation show that J-DAPT boosts detection accuracy to nearly 100%
with minimal overhead. These results demonstrate that J-DAPT provides a
practical defense for securing VLMs in robotic applications. Additional

Abstract: Autonomous technology, which has become widespread today, appears in many
different configurations such as mobile robots, manipulators, and drones. One
of the most important tasks of these vehicles during autonomous operations is
path planning. In the literature, path planners are generally divided into two
categories: probabilistic and deterministic methods. In the analysis of
probabilistic methods, the common problem of almost all methods is observed in
narrow passage environments. In this paper, a novel sampler is proposed that
deterministically identifies narrow passage environments using occupancy grid
maps and accordingly increases the amount of sampling in these regions. The
codes of the algorithm is provided as open source. To evaluate the performance
of the algorithm, benchmark studies are conducted in three distinct categories:
specific and random simulation environments, and a real-world environment. As a
result, it is observed that our algorithm provides higher performance in
planning time and number of milestones compared to the baseline samplers.

Abstract: In unknown non-convex environments, such as indoor and underground spaces,
deploying a fleet of robots to explore the surroundings while simultaneously
searching for and tracking targets of interest to maintain high-precision data
collection represents a fundamental challenge that urgently requires resolution
in applications such as environmental monitoring and rescue operations. Current
research has made significant progress in addressing environmental exploration,
information search, and target tracking problems, but has yet to establish a
framework for simultaneously optimizing these tasks in complex environments. In
this paper, we propose a novel motion planning algorithm framework that
integrates three control strategies: a frontier-based exploration strategy, a
guaranteed coverage strategy based on Lloyd's algorithm, and a sensor-based
multi-target tracking strategy. By incorporating these three strategies, the
proposed algorithm balances coverage search and high-precision active tracking
during exploration. Our approach is validated through a series of MATLAB
simulations, demonstrating validity and superiority over standard approaches.

Abstract: This paper presents the framework \textbf{GUARD} (\textbf{G}uided robot

optimization for \textbf{R}isk-aware \textbf{D}ecision making) that combines
traditional control with an uncertainty-aware perception technique using active
learning with real-time capability for safe robot collision avoidance. By doing
so, this manuscript addresses the central challenge in robotics of finding a
reasonable compromise between traditional methods and learning algorithms to
foster the development of safe, yet efficient and flexible applications. By
unifying a reactive model predictive countouring control (RMPCC) with an
Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm that enables the attribution of
uncertainty sources online using active learning with real-time capability via
a probabilistic kernel optimization technique, \emph{GUARD} inherently handles
the existing ambiguity of the term \textit{safety} that exists in robotics

Abstract: The growing ambition for space exploration demands robust autonomous systems
that can operate in unstructured environments under extreme extraterrestrial
conditions. The adoption of robot learning in this domain is severely hindered
by the prohibitive cost of technology demonstrations and the limited
availability of data. To bridge this gap, we introduce the Space Robotics
Bench, an open-source simulation framework for robot learning in space. It
offers a modular architecture that integrates on-demand procedural generation
with massively parallel simulation environments to support the creation of vast
and diverse training distributions for learning-based agents. To ground
research and enable direct comparison, the framework includes a comprehensive
suite of benchmark tasks that span a wide range of mission-relevant scenarios.
We establish performance baselines using standard reinforcement learning
algorithms and present a series of experimental case studies that investigate
key challenges in generalization, end-to-end learning, adaptive control, and
sim-to-real transfer. Our results reveal insights into the limitations of
current methods and demonstrate the utility of the framework in producing
policies capable of real-world operation. These contributions establish the
Space Robotics Bench as a valuable resource for developing, benchmarking, and

such attitude determination are easily prone to disturbances by their
sensitivity to calibration and external magnetic fields. The TRIAD (Tri-Axial
Attitude Determination) algorithm is well known as a sub-optimal attitude
estimator. In this article, we incorporate this sub-optimal feature of the
TRIAD in mitigating the influence of the magnetometer reading in the pitch and
roll axis determination in the Manifold EKF algorithm. We substantiate our
results with experiments.

TL;DR: 提出一种多模态策略分解方法，将策略分解为多个专门处理单一模态的扩散模型，通过路由器网络自适应组合各模态贡献，在接触丰富的操作任务中优于特征拼接基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统特征拼接方法存在主导模态（如视觉）淹没稀疏但关键信号（如触觉）的问题，且无法灵活处理新模态或缺失模态，需要重新训练。

Method: 将策略分解为一组扩散模型，每个模型专门处理单一表示（如视觉或触觉），使用路由器网络学习共识权重来自适应组合各模态贡献，支持新表示的增量集成。

Result: 在RLBench模拟操作任务和真实世界任务（遮挡物体抓取、手中勺子重定向、拼图插入）中显著优于特征拼接基线，对物理扰动和传感器损坏具有鲁棒性，扰动分析显示模态间的自适应切换。

Conclusion: 该方法在多模态推理场景中表现出色，能够自适应调整模态权重，支持增量集成新模态，为机器人操作提供了更灵活有效的多模态融合方案。

Abstract: Effectively integrating diverse sensory modalities is crucial for robotic
manipulation. However, the typical approach of feature concatenation is often
suboptimal: dominant modalities such as vision can overwhelm sparse but
critical signals like touch in contact-rich tasks, and monolithic architectures
cannot flexibly incorporate new or missing modalities without retraining. Our
method factorizes the policy into a set of diffusion models, each specialized
for a single representation (e.g., vision or touch), and employs a router
network that learns consensus weights to adaptively combine their
contributions, enabling incremental of new representations. We evaluate our
approach on simulated manipulation tasks in {RLBench}, as well as real-world
tasks such as occluded object picking, in-hand spoon reorientation, and puzzle
insertion, where it significantly outperforms feature-concatenation baselines
on scenarios requiring multimodal reasoning. Our policy further demonstrates
robustness to physical perturbations and sensor corruption. We further conduct
perturbation-based importance analysis, which reveals adaptive shifts between
modalities.

Conclusion: 该去中心化框架有效解决了异构机器人团队的协作冲突问题，在保持高性能的同时降低了信息需求。

Abstract: Increased robot deployment, such as in warehousing, has revealed a need for
seamless collaboration among heterogeneous robot teams to resolve unforeseen
conflicts. To address this challenge, we propose a novel decentralized
framework that enables robots to request and provide help. The process begins
when a robot detects a conflict and uses a Large Language Model (LLM) to decide
whether external assistance is required. If so, it crafts and broadcasts a
natural language (NL) help request. Potential helper robots reason over the
request and respond with offers of assistance, including information about the
effect on their ongoing tasks. Helper reasoning is implemented via an LLM
grounded in Signal Temporal Logic (STL) using a Backus-Naur Form (BNF) grammar,
ensuring syntactically valid NL-to-STL translations, which are then solved as a
Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP). Finally, the requester robot selects a
helper by reasoning over the expected increase in system-level total task
completion time. We evaluated our framework through experiments comparing
different helper-selection strategies and found that considering multiple
offers allows the requester to minimize added makespan. Our approach
significantly outperforms heuristics such as selecting the nearest available
candidate helper robot, and achieves performance comparable to a centralized
"Oracle" baseline but without heavy information demands.

Motivation: 软体机器人因其被动柔顺性特别适合接触丰富的全身操作任务，但其运动学和动力学的不确定性给仿真和控制带来了挑战。

Method: 使用在MuJoCo中开发的快速仿真框架（单线程可达实时350倍速度），结合简单的运动基元指导强化学习，实现零样本策略迁移。

Result: 在Baloo硬件平台上成功实现了强力六自由度全身操作（10公斤有效载荷），策略成功率88%，并表现出有益的响应行为如重新抓取和扰动恢复。

Conclusion: 这是首次使用两个连续软体臂在大规模平台上实现强力六自由度全身操作的零样本策略迁移演示，证明了运动基元指导对成功的关键作用。

Abstract: Whole-body manipulation is a powerful yet underexplored approach that enables
robots to interact with large, heavy, or awkward objects using more than just
their end-effectors. Soft robots, with their inherent passive compliance, are
particularly well-suited for such contact-rich manipulation tasks, but their
uncertainties in kinematics and dynamics pose significant challenges for
simulation and control. In this work, we address this challenge with a
simulation that can run up to 350x real time on a single thread in MuJoCo and
provide a detailed analysis of the critical tradeoffs between speed and
accuracy for this simulation. Using this framework, we demonstrate a successful
zero-shot sim-to-real transfer of a learned whole-body manipulation policy,
achieving an 88% success rate on the Baloo hardware platform. We show that
guiding RL with a simple motion primitive is critical to this success where
standard reward shaping methods struggled to produce a stable and successful
policy for whole-body manipulation. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that the
learned policy does not simply mimic the motion primitive. It exhibits
beneficial reactive behavior, such as re-grasping and perturbation recovery. We
analyze and contrast this learned policy against an open-loop baseline to show
that the policy can also exhibit aggressive over-corrections under
perturbation. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of forceful,
six-DoF whole-body manipulation using two continuum soft arms on a large-scale
platform (10 kg payloads), with zero-shot policy transfer.

Motivation: 准直驱驱动需要高扭矩、低转速的薄盘形电机，但传统绕线定子在20mm以下直径时铜填充率低，导致电阻大、连续扭矩受限。

Method: 采用印刷电路板绕组和先进IC基板高密度互连技术，通过堆叠四个12层HDI模块形成48层定子结构。

Result: 在19mm直径、5mm厚度的封装中实现了45%的创纪录铜填充率，并通过电磁和热分析指导设计，制造了原型机并进行了实验验证。

Conclusion: PCB绕组结合HDI技术成功解决了微型AFPM电机的铜填充率限制，为小型化高扭矩电机提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Quasi-direct-drive (QDD) actuation is transforming legged and manipulator
robots by eliminating high-ratio gearboxes, yet it demands motors that deliver
very high torque at low speed within a thin, disc-shaped joint envelope.
Axial-flux permanent-magnet (AFPM) machines meet these geometric and torque
requirements, but scaling them below a 20mm outer diameter is hampered by poor
copper fill in conventional wound stators, inflating resistance and throttling
continuous torque. This paper introduces a micro-scale AFPM motor that
overcomes these limitations through printed-circuit-board (PCB) windings
fabricated with advanced IC-substrate high-density interconnect (HDI)
technology. The resulting 48-layer stator-formed by stacking four 12-layer HDI
modules-achieves a record 45\% copper fill in a package only 5mm thick and 19mm
in diameter. We perform comprehensive electromagnetic and thermal analyses to
inform the motor design, then fabricate a prototype whose performance
characteristics are experimentally verified.

Motivation: 现有的语义导航方法主要针对室内结构化环境，无法适应大范围、非结构化的户外环境。户外方法要么依赖反应式策略导致短视行为，要么需要离线预计算场景图限制了在线部署的适应性。

Method: 使用空间一致的语义体素-射线地图作为持久记忆，结合短距离体素搜索和长距离射线搜索，利用大视觉语言模型提供辅助线索，通过行为树协调不同行为模块。

Conclusion: RAVEN框架成功解决了户外语义导航的挑战，通过3D记忆和自适应行为切换实现了鲁棒的户外目标搜索能力。

Abstract: Aerial outdoor semantic navigation requires robots to explore large,
unstructured environments to locate target objects. Recent advances in semantic
navigation have demonstrated open-set object-goal navigation in indoor
settings, but these methods remain limited by constrained spatial ranges and
structured layouts, making them unsuitable for long-range outdoor search. While
outdoor semantic navigation approaches exist, they either rely on reactive
policies based on current observations, which tend to produce short-sighted
behaviors, or precompute scene graphs offline for navigation, limiting
adaptability to online deployment. We present RAVEN, a 3D memory-based,
behavior tree framework for aerial semantic navigation in unstructured outdoor
environments. It (1) uses a spatially consistent semantic voxel-ray map as
persistent memory, enabling long-horizon planning and avoiding purely reactive
behaviors, (2) combines short-range voxel search and long-range ray search to
scale to large environments, (3) leverages a large vision-language model to
suggest auxiliary cues, mitigating sparsity of outdoor targets. These
components are coordinated by a behavior tree, which adaptively switches
behaviors for robust operation. We evaluate RAVEN in 10 photorealistic outdoor
simulation environments over 100 semantic tasks, encompassing single-object
search, multi-class, multi-instance navigation and sequential task changes.
Results show RAVEN outperforms baselines by 85.25% in simulation and
demonstrate its real-world applicability through deployment on an aerial robot
in outdoor field tests.

Abstract: Robust and human-like dexterous grasping of general objects is a critical
capability for advancing intelligent robotic manipulation in real-world

priors often result in unnatural behaviors. In this work, we present
\textit{ContactGrasp}, a robotic dexterous pre-grasp and grasp dataset that
explicitly accounts for task-relevant wrist orientation and thumb-index
pinching coordination. The dataset covers 773 objects in 82 categories,
providing a rich foundation for training human-like grasp strategies. Building
upon this dataset, we perform geometry-based clustering to group objects by
shape, enabling a two-stage Geometry-based Expert Selection (GES) framework
that selects among specialized experts for grasping diverse object geometries,
thereby enhancing adaptability to diverse shapes and generalization across
categories. Our approach demonstrates natural grasp postures and achieves high

showcasing strong generalization and high-quality grasp execution.

Conclusion: CLAP框架通过语言对齐的分层策略有效提升了机器人3D操作任务的泛化性能，在仿真和真实环境中都表现出色。

Abstract: Hierarchical coarse-to-fine policy, where a coarse branch predicts a region
of interest to guide a fine-grained action predictor, has demonstrated
significant potential in robotic 3D manipulation tasks by especially enhancing
sample efficiency and enabling more precise manipulation. However, even
augmented with pre-trained models, these hierarchical policies still suffer
from generalization issues. To enhance generalization to novel instructions and
environment variations, we propose Coarse-to-fine Language-Aligned manipulation
Policy (CLAP), a framework that integrates three key components: 1) task
decomposition, 2) VLM fine-tuning for 3D keypoint prediction, and 3) 3D-aware
representation. Through comprehensive experiments in simulation and on a real
robot, we demonstrate its superior generalization capability. Specifically, on
GemBench, a benchmark designed for evaluating generalization, our approach
achieves a 12\% higher average success rate than the SOTA method while using
only 1/5 of the training trajectories. In real-world experiments, our policy,
trained on only 10 demonstrations, successfully generalizes to novel
instructions and environments.

Conclusion: 该工作为软体机器人安全控制提供了形式化框架，能够有效防止材料失效，推动软体机器人在实际应用中的安全部署。

Abstract: Until recently, the concept of soft robot safety was an informal notion,
often attributed solely to the fact that soft robots are less likely to damage
their operating environment than rigid robots. As the field moves toward
feedback control for practical applications, it becomes increasingly important
to define what safety means and to characterize how soft robots can become
unsafe. The unifying theme of soft robotics is to achieve useful functionality
through deformation. Consequently, limitations in constitutive model accuracy
and risks of material failure are inherent to all soft robots and pose a key
challenge in designing provably safe controllers. This work introduces a formal
definition of material safety based on strain energy functions and provides a
controller that enforces it. We characterize safe and unsafe sets of an
incompressible hyperelastic material and demonstrate that safety can be
enforced using a high-order control barrier function (HOCBF) with quadratic
program-based feedback control. As a case study, we consider a pressurized
hyperelastic tube with inertial effects, first-order viscous effects, and
full-state feedback. Simulation results verify that the proposed methodology
can enforce the material safety specification.

Conclusion: KiVi框架通过模态平衡的集成设计，有效提升了腿式机器人在真实世界环境中的运动稳定性和适用性。

Abstract: Vision-based locomotion has shown great promise in enabling legged robots to
perceive and adapt to complex environments. However, visual information is
inherently fragile, being vulnerable to occlusions, reflections, and lighting
changes, which often cause instability in locomotion. Inspired by animal
sensorimotor integration, we propose KiVi, a Kinesthetic-Visuospatial
integration framework, where kinesthetics encodes proprioceptive sensing of
body motion and visuospatial reasoning captures visual perception of
surrounding terrain. Specifically, KiVi separates these pathways, leveraging
proprioception as a stable backbone while selectively incorporating vision for
terrain awareness and obstacle avoidance. This modality-balanced, yet
integrative design, combined with memory-enhanced attention, allows the robot
to robustly interpret visual cues while maintaining fallback stability through
proprioception. Extensive experiments show that our method enables quadruped
robots to stably traverse diverse terrains and operate reliably in unstructured
outdoor environments, remaining robust to out-of-distribution (OOD) visual
noise and occlusion unseen during training, thereby highlighting its
effectiveness and applicability to real-world legged locomotion.

Conclusion: HeLoM框架通过协调多腿控制实现了稳定高效的推动操作，展示了从仿真到真实世界的直接部署能力。

Abstract: Robots in real-world environments are often required to move/manipulate
objects comparable in weight to their own bodies. Compared to grasping and
carrying, pushing provides a more straightforward and efficient non-prehensile
manipulation strategy, avoiding complex grasp design while leveraging direct
contact to regulate an object's pose. Achieving effective pushing, however,
demands both sufficient manipulation forces and the ability to maintain
stability, which is particularly challenging when dealing with heavy or
irregular objects. To address these challenges, we propose HeLoM, a
learning-based hierarchical whole-body manipulation framework for a hexapod
robot that exploits coordinated multi-limb control. Inspired by the cooperative
strategies of multi-legged insects, our framework leverages redundant contact
points and high degrees of freedom to enable dynamic redistribution of contact
forces. HeLoM's high-level planner plans pushing behaviors and target object
poses, while its low-level controller maintains locomotion stability and
generates dynamically consistent joint actions. Our policies trained in
simulation are directly deployed on real robots without additional fine-tuning.
This design allows the robot to maintain balance while exerting continuous and
controllable pushing forces through coordinated foreleg interaction and
supportive hind-leg propulsion. We validate the effectiveness of HeLoM through
both simulation and real-world experiments. Results show that our framework can
stably push boxes of varying sizes and unknown physical properties to
designated goal poses in the real world.

Conclusion: Oat-VLA通过高效的视觉标记化方案，显著降低了VLA模型的训练成本，同时保持了良好的性能表现。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models offer a pivotal approach to learning
robotic manipulation at scale by repurposing large pre-trained
Vision-Language-Models (VLM) to output robotic actions. However, adapting VLMs
for robotic domains comes with an unnecessarily high computational cost, which
we attribute to the tokenization scheme of visual inputs. In this work, we aim
to enable efficient VLA training by proposing Oat-VLA, an Object-Agent-centric
Tokenization for VLAs. Building on the insights of object-centric
representation learning, our method introduces an inductive bias towards scene
objects and the agent's own visual information. As a result, we find that
Oat-VLA can drastically reduce the number of visual tokens to just a few tokens
without sacrificing performance. We reveal that Oat-VLA converges at least
twice as fast as OpenVLA on the LIBERO suite, as well as outperform OpenVLA in
diverse real-world pick and place tasks.

Motivation: 机器人学中的非凸问题可通过半定规划松弛为凸问题，但实际解的质量取决于能否获得秩1矩阵，这通常需要额外的紧化处理。

Conclusion: 迹约束半定规划框架为机器人非凸问题提供了有效的全局优化解决方案，并通过模块化虚拟机器人抽象简化了建模过程。

Abstract: Many nonconvex problems in robotics can be relaxed into convex formulations
via semidefinite programming (SDP), which offers the advantage of global
optimality. The practical quality of these solutions, however, critically
depends on achieving rank-1 matrices, a condition that typically requires
additional tightening. In this work, we focus on trace-constrained SDPs, where
the decision variables are positive semidefinite (PSD) matrices with fixed
trace values. These additional constraints not only capture important
structural properties but also facilitate first-order methods for recovering
rank-1 solutions. We introduce customized fixed-trace variables and constraints
to represent common robotic quantities such as rotations and translations,
which can be exactly recovered when the corresponding variables are rank-1. To
further improve practical performance, we develop a gradient-based refinement
procedure that projects relaxed SDP solutions toward rank-1, low-cost
candidates, which can then be certified for global optimality via the dual
problem. We demonstrate that many robotics tasks can be expressed within this
trace-constrained SDP framework, and showcase its effectiveness through
simulations in perspective-n-point (PnP) estimation, hand-eye calibration, and
dual-robot system calibration. To support broader use, we also introduce a
modular ``virtual robot'' abstraction that simplifies modeling across different
problem settings.

Motivation: 传统多机器人覆盖路径规划方法假设机器人以固定速度移动，这在现实应用中不切实际，导致工作负载分布不均和完成时间增加。

Method: 使用高斯混合模型近似目标分布来动态估计每个机器人的剩余工作负载，并采用容量约束Voronoi图分配覆盖区域，还开发了分布式实现用于范围受限的机器人网络。

Result: 仿真结果表明MDCPP在定性改进和性能上优于现有的扫描算法，并量化了通信范围对覆盖效率的影响。

Conclusion: MDCPP算法有效解决了多机器人覆盖路径规划中的动态负载平衡问题，提高了覆盖效率。

Abstract: Multi-robot Coverage Path Planning (MCPP) addresses the problem of computing
paths for multiple robots to effectively cover a large area of interest.
Conventional approaches to MCPP typically assume that robots move at fixed
velocities, which is often unrealistic in real-world applications where robots
must adapt their speeds based on the specific coverage tasks assigned to
them.Consequently, conventional approaches often lead to imbalanced workload
distribution among robots and increased completion time for coverage tasks. To
address this, we introduce a novel Multi-robot Dynamic Coverage Path Planning
(MDCPP) algorithm for complete coverage in two-dimensional environments. MDCPP
dynamically estimates each robot's remaining workload by approximating the
target distribution with Gaussian mixture models, and assigns coverage regions
using a capacity-constrained Voronoi diagram. We further develop a distributed
implementation of MDCPP for range-constrained robotic networks. Simulation
results validate the efficacy of MDCPP, showing qualitative improvements and
superior performance compared to an existing sweeping algorithm, and a
quantifiable impact of communication range on coverage efficiency.

pushed the field forward, most methods still rely on manually designed action
parameterizations, limiting their ability to produce the highly coordinated
motions required in complex tasks. Motion planning can generate feasible
trajectories, but the dynamics gap-stemming from control inaccuracies, contact
uncertainties, and aerodynamic effects-often causes large deviations between
planned and executed trajectories. In this work, we propose Dynamics-Aware
Motion Manifold Primitives (DA-MMP), a motion generation framework for
goal-conditioned dynamic manipulation, and instantiate it on a challenging
real-world ring-tossing task. Our approach extends motion manifold primitives
to variable-length trajectories through a compact parametrization and learns a
high-quality manifold from a large-scale dataset of planned motions. Building
on this manifold, a conditional flow matching model is trained in the latent
space with a small set of real-world trials, enabling the generation of
throwing trajectories that account for execution dynamics. Experiments show
that our method can generate coordinated and smooth motion trajectories for the
ring-tossing task. In real-world evaluations, it achieves high success rates
and even surpasses the performance of trained human experts. Moreover, it
generalizes to novel targets beyond the training range, indicating that it
successfully learns the underlying trajectory-dynamics mapping.

TL;DR: LocoFormer是一个通用的全身体运动控制模型，能够控制未见过的腿式和轮式机器人，无需精确的运动学知识，并能适应形态和动态变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的运动控制器需要针对特定机器人进行手动调优，缺乏通用性和适应性。

Method: 使用大规模强化学习在程序生成的机器人上进行训练，采用激进的领域随机化，并大幅扩展上下文长度以跨越情节边界。

Result: LocoFormer能够部署到各种机器人上，即使在重量变化和电机故障等大扰动下也能实现鲁棒控制，并在极端场景中表现出跨情节的适应性。

Conclusion: 这种简单而通用的方法可用于训练未来其他机器人技能的基础模型。

Abstract: Modern locomotion controllers are manually tuned for specific embodiments. We
present LocoFormer, a generalist omni-bodied locomotion model that can control
previously unseen legged and wheeled robots, even without precise knowledge of
their kinematics. LocoFormer is able to adapt to changes in morphology and
dynamics at test time. We find that two key choices enable adaptation. First,
we train massive scale RL on procedurally generated robots with aggressive
domain randomization. Second, in contrast to previous policies that are myopic
with short context lengths, we extend context by orders of magnitude to span
episode boundaries. We deploy the same LocoFormer to varied robots and show
robust control even with large disturbances such as weight change and motor
failures. In extreme scenarios, we see emergent adaptation across episodes,
LocoFormer learns from falls in early episodes to improve control strategies in
later ones. We believe that this simple, yet general recipe can be used to
train foundation models for other robotic skills in the future. Videos at

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了Sequential Pathfinder (SePar)方法，将多智能体路径规划建模为序列建模问题，利用Transformer范式实现隐式信息交换，在保持全局感知的同时将决策复杂度从指数级降低到线性级。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多智能体拾取和配送任务中，基于学习的方法在狭窄通道环境中仅依赖局部观察表现不佳的问题，同时避免点对点通信带来的高计算复杂度。

Method: 将MAPF建模为序列建模问题，证明路径规划策略在序列建模下具有顺序不变最优性，提出SePar方法利用Transformer实现隐式信息交换。

Result: SePar在各种MAPF任务及其变体上持续优于现有基于学习的方法，在未见环境中泛化良好，在复杂地图中集成模仿学习是必要的。

Conclusion: SePar通过序列建模和Transformer范式有效解决了MAPD中的信息交换和计算复杂度问题，在保持效率的同时提升了性能。

Abstract: Multi-Agent Pickup and Delivery (MAPD) is a challenging extension of
Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF), where agents are required to sequentially
complete tasks with fixed-location pickup and delivery demands. Although
learning-based methods have made progress in MAPD, they often perform poorly in
warehouse-like environments with narrow pathways and long corridors when
relying only on local observations for distributed decision-making.
Communication learning can alleviate the lack of global information but
introduce high computational complexity due to point-to-point communication. To
address this challenge, we formulate MAPF as a sequence modeling problem and
prove that path-finding policies under sequence modeling possess
order-invariant optimality, ensuring its effectiveness in MAPD. Building on
this, we propose the Sequential Pathfinder (SePar), which leverages the
Transformer paradigm to achieve implicit information exchange, reducing
decision-making complexity from exponential to linear while maintaining
efficiency and global awareness. Experiments demonstrate that SePar
consistently outperforms existing learning-based methods across various MAPF
tasks and their variants, and generalizes well to unseen environments.
Furthermore, we highlight the necessity of integrating imitation learning in
complex maps like warehouses.

Abstract: To address the need for high-precision localization of climbing robots in
complex high-altitude environments, this paper proposes a multi-sensor fusion
system that overcomes the limitations of single-sensor approaches. Firstly, the
localization scenarios and the problem model are analyzed. An integrated
architecture of Attention Mechanism-based Fusion Algorithm (AMFA) incorporating
planar array Ultra-Wideband (UWB), GPS, Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), and
barometer is designed to handle challenges such as GPS occlusion and UWB
Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) problem. Then, End-to-end neural network inference
models for UWB and barometer are developed, along with a multimodal attention
mechanism for adaptive data fusion. An Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) is applied
to refine the trajectory, improving accuracy and robustness. Finally,
real-world experiments show that the method achieves 0.48 m localization
accuracy and lower MAX error of 1.50 m, outperforming baseline algorithms such
as GPS/INS-EKF and demonstrating stronger robustness.

TL;DR: DexFlyWheel是一个可扩展的灵巧操作数据生成框架，通过自改进循环持续丰富数据多样性，在四个挑战性任务中生成2000多个多样化演示，训练出的策略在测试集上达到81.9%的平均成功率，并通过数字孪生成功迁移到现实世界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 灵巧操作对提升机器人真实世界应用能力至关重要，但目前缺乏多样化高质量数据集。现有数据收集方法依赖人工遥操作、需要大量人工工程或生成数据多样性有限，限制了可扩展性和泛化能力。

Method: 采用自改进循环框架：从高效种子演示开始，通过迭代循环扩展数据集。每个循环包含模仿学习提取人类行为、残差强化学习增强策略泛化、轨迹收集和数据增强。学习到的策略在仿真中生成轨迹，在不同环境和空间配置下增强后反馈到下一循环。

Conclusion: DexFlyWheel框架通过自改进数据飞轮效应产生覆盖多样化场景的数据集，从而扩展策略性能，成功解决了灵巧操作数据稀缺和多样性不足的问题。

Abstract: Dexterous manipulation is critical for advancing robot capabilities in
real-world applications, yet diverse and high-quality datasets remain scarce.
Existing data collection methods either rely on human teleoperation or require
significant human engineering, or generate data with limited diversity, which
restricts their scalability and generalization. In this paper, we introduce
DexFlyWheel, a scalable data generation framework that employs a self-improving
cycle to continuously enrich data diversity. Starting from efficient seed
demonstrations warmup, DexFlyWheel expands the dataset through iterative
cycles. Each cycle follows a closed-loop pipeline that integrates Imitation
Learning (IL), residual Reinforcement Learning (RL), rollout trajectory
collection, and data augmentation. Specifically, IL extracts human-like
behaviors from demonstrations, and residual RL enhances policy generalization.
The learned policy is then used to generate trajectories in simulation, which
are further augmented across diverse environments and spatial configurations
before being fed back into the next cycle. Over successive iterations, a
self-improving data flywheel effect emerges, producing datasets that cover
diverse scenarios and thereby scaling policy performance. Experimental results
demonstrate that DexFlyWheel generates over 2,000 diverse demonstrations across
four challenging tasks. Policies trained on our dataset achieve an average
success rate of 81.9\% on the challenge test sets and successfully transfer to
the real world through digital twin, achieving a 78.3\% success rate on
dual-arm lift tasks.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: MAD-PINN是一个去中心化的物理信息机器学习框架，用于解决多智能体状态约束最优控制问题，在安全性和性能之间实现更好的权衡，并保持可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模多智能体系统中同时优化安全性和性能仍是一个基本挑战。现有方法如多智能体强化学习、安全过滤或模型预测控制要么缺乏严格的安全保证，要么过于保守，要么无法有效扩展。

Method: 采用基于外延的SC-OCP重构来同时捕获性能和安全，通过物理信息神经网络近似其解。通过训练减少智能体系统的SC-OCP值函数并以去中心化方式部署实现可扩展性。引入基于Hamilton-Jacobi可达性的邻居选择策略和滚动时域策略执行方案。

Conclusion: MAD-PINN框架成功解决了大规模多智能体系统的安全-性能协同优化问题，提供了一种可扩展且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Co-optimizing safety and performance in large-scale multi-agent systems
remains a fundamental challenge. Existing approaches based on multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL), safety filtering, or Model Predictive Control
(MPC) either lack strict safety guarantees, suffer from conservatism, or fail
to scale effectively. We propose MAD-PINN, a decentralized physics-informed
machine learning framework for solving the multi-agent state-constrained
optimal control problem (MASC-OCP). Our method leverages an epigraph-based
reformulation of SC-OCP to simultaneously capture performance and safety, and
approximates its solution via a physics-informed neural network. Scalability is
achieved by training the SC-OCP value function on reduced-agent systems and
deploying them in a decentralized fashion, where each agent relies only on
local observations of its neighbours for decision-making. To further enhance
safety and efficiency, we introduce an Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability-based
neighbour selection strategy to prioritize safety-critical interactions, and a
receding-horizon policy execution scheme that adapts to dynamic interactions
while reducing computational burden. Experiments on multi-agent navigation
tasks demonstrate that MAD-PINN achieves superior safety-performance
trade-offs, maintains scalability as the number of agents grows, and
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

TL;DR: Flash是一个轻量级的视觉位置识别系统，使用亚毫秒级的事件数据片段进行位置预测，通过二进制帧编码活跃像素位置，并利用快速位运算计算相似度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的事件相机VPR方法依赖密集表示稀疏的相机输出，需要数十到数百毫秒的事件数据来预测位置，这限制了系统的响应速度。

Method: 基于活跃像素位置提供强判别特征的观察，Flash使用高效的二进制帧编码这些位置，通过快速位运算计算相似度，并根据查询和参考帧中的相对事件活动进行归一化。

Result: 在室内QCR-Event-Dataset上，Flash将亚毫秒级VPR的Recall@1提高了11.33倍；在8公里Brisbane-Event-VPR数据集上提高了5.92倍。同时显著减少了机器人无位置感知的运行时间。

Conclusion: 这是首个展示使用事件相机实现亚毫秒级视觉位置识别的工作，通过利用事件数据的稀疏特性实现了快速准确的位置识别。

Abstract: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) enables systems to identify previously visited
locations within a map, a fundamental task for autonomous navigation. Prior
works have developed VPR solutions using event cameras, which asynchronously
measure per-pixel brightness changes with microsecond temporal resolution.
However, these approaches rely on dense representations of the inherently
sparse camera output and require tens to hundreds of milliseconds of event data
to predict a place. Here, we break this paradigm with Flash, a lightweight VPR
system that predicts places using sub-millisecond slices of event data. Our
method is based on the observation that active pixel locations provide strong
discriminative features for VPR. Flash encodes these active pixel locations
using efficient binary frames and computes similarities via fast bitwise
operations, which are then normalized based on the relative event activity in
the query and reference frames. Flash improves Recall@1 for sub-millisecond VPR
over existing baselines by 11.33x on the indoor QCR-Event-Dataset and 5.92x on
the 8 km Brisbane-Event-VPR dataset. Moreover, our approach reduces the
duration for which the robot must operate without awareness of its position, as
evidenced by a localization latency metric we term Time to Correct Match (TCM).
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to demonstrate
sub-millisecond VPR using event cameras.

Motivation: 在多模态环境中，粒子滤波器容易过早收敛到单一模式，需要有效的多样性维护机制来保持对多个可能状态的跟踪。

Method: 基于粒子祖先树的拓扑结构进行聚类，将密切相关的粒子分组，结合簇内适应度共享和未聚类粒子的保护机制。

Result: 在多模态机器人仿真和真实室内环境中验证，相比确定性重采样和粒子高斯混合等方法，该算法实现了高成功率且对紧凑性影响很小。

Conclusion: 该方法在多模态环境中有效防止过早收敛，保持估计紧凑性，对不同领域和挑战性初始条件表现出强鲁棒性。

Abstract: We propose a method for linear-time diversity maintenance in particle
filtering. It clusters particles based on ancestry tree topology: closely
related particles in sufficiently large subtrees are grouped together. The main
idea is that the tree structure implicitly encodes similarity without the need
for spatial or other domain-specific metrics. This approach, when combined with
intra-cluster fitness sharing and the protection of particles not included in a
cluster, effectively prevents premature convergence in multimodal environments
while maintaining estimate compactness. We validate our approach in a
multimodal robotics simulation and a real-world multimodal indoor environment.
We compare the performance to several diversity maintenance algorithms from the
literature, including Deterministic Resampling and Particle Gaussian Mixtures.
Our algorithm achieves high success rates with little to no negative effect on
compactness, showing particular robustness to different domains and challenging
initial conditions.

Abstract: Active vision (AV) has been in the spotlight of robotics research due to its
emergence in numerous applications including agricultural tasks such as
precision crop monitoring and autonomous harvesting to list a few. A major AV
problem that gained popularity is the 3D reconstruction of targeted
environments using 2D images from diverse viewpoints. While collecting and
processing a large number of arbitrarily captured 2D images can be arduous in
many practical scenarios, a more efficient solution involves optimizing the
placement of available cameras in 3D space to capture fewer, yet more
informative, images that provide sufficient visual information for effective
reconstruction of the environment of interest. This process termed as view
planning (VP), can be markedly challenged (i) by noise emerging in the location
of the cameras and/or in the extracted images, and (ii) by the need to
generalize well in other unknown similar agricultural environments without need
for re-optimizing or re-training. To cope with these challenges, the present
work presents a novel VP framework that considers a reconstruction
quality-based optimization formulation that relies on the notion of
`structure-from-motion' to reconstruct the 3D structure of the sought
environment from the selected 2D images. With no analytic expression of the
optimization function and with costly function evaluations, a Bayesian
optimization approach is proposed to efficiently carry out the VP process using
only a few function evaluations, while accounting for different noise cases.
Numerical tests on both simulated and real agricultural settings signify the
benefits of the advocated VP approach in efficiently estimating the optimal
camera placement to accurately reconstruct 3D environments of interest, and
generalize well on similar unknown environments.

Motivation: 大多数机器人操作研究关注物体运动状态变化（如抓取、放置），但现实世界中许多任务涉及物体物理和视觉状态的渐进变化，这类任务缺乏统一的处理框架。

Method: SPARTA整合空间渐进式物体变化分割图，利用视觉技能感知特定任务中的可操作区域与已变换区域，生成结构化策略观察和密集奖励，支持强化学习和贪心控制两种策略变体。

Conclusion: 基于进度感知的视觉表示是处理更广泛物体状态操作任务的多功能基础，SPARTA为这类任务提供了有效的统一解决方案。

Abstract: Most robot manipulation focuses on changing the kinematic state of objects:
picking, placing, opening, or rotating them. However, a wide range of
real-world manipulation tasks involve a different class of object state
change--such as mashing, spreading, or slicing--where the object's physical and
visual state evolve progressively without necessarily changing its position. We
present SPARTA, the first unified framework for the family of object state
change manipulation tasks. Our key insight is that these tasks share a common
structural pattern: they involve spatially-progressing, object-centric changes
that can be represented as regions transitioning from an actionable to a
transformed state. Building on this insight, SPARTA integrates spatially
progressing object change segmentation maps, a visual skill to perceive
actionable vs. transformed regions for specific object state change tasks, to
generate a) structured policy observations that strip away appearance
variability, and b) dense rewards that capture incremental progress over time.
These are leveraged in two SPARTA policy variants: reinforcement learning for
fine-grained control without demonstrations or simulation; and greedy control
for fast, lightweight deployment. We validate SPARTA on a real robot for three
challenging tasks across 10 diverse real-world objects, achieving significant
improvements in training time and accuracy over sparse rewards and visual
goal-conditioned baselines. Our results highlight progress-aware visual
representations as a versatile foundation for the broader family of object
state manipulation tasks. Project website:

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效处理固定翼无人机的完整3D运动规划问题，考虑实际控制约束，提供快速且优化的路径解决方案

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new modeling approach and a fast algorithm for 3D
motion planning, applicable for fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles. The goal
is to construct the shortest path connecting given initial and final
configurations subject to motion constraints. Our work differs from existing
literature in two ways. First, we consider full vehicle orientation using a
body-attached frame, which includes roll, pitch, and yaw angles. However,
existing work uses only pitch and/or heading angle, which is insufficient to
uniquely determine orientation. Second, we use two control inputs to represent
bounded pitch and yaw rates, reflecting control by two separate actuators. In
contrast, most previous methods rely on a single input, such as path curvature,
which is insufficient for accurately modeling the vehicle's kinematics in 3D.
We use a rotation minimizing frame to describe the vehicle's configuration and
its evolution, and construct paths by concatenating optimal Dubins paths on
spherical, cylindrical, or planar surfaces. Numerical simulations show our
approach generates feasible paths within 10 seconds on average and yields
shorter paths than existing methods in most cases.

Motivation: 现有LLM机器人操作方法难以适应新环境，需要环境特定策略训练或依赖固定提示，导致可迁移性差且需要手动重新调整。

Method: MTP框架：(i)使用LLM生成初始计划和代码，(ii)从代码记忆中检索相关成功示例，(iii)将检索到的代码上下文适应到目标设置中进行重新规划。

Conclusion: MTP提供了一种实用方法，利用程序知识实现跨多样化机器人操作场景的鲁棒LLM规划，增强了对新环境的适应性，并弥合了仿真和现实世界部署之间的差距。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly explored in robot manipulation,
but many existing methods struggle to adapt to new environments. Many systems
require either environment-specific policy training or depend on fixed prompts
and single-shot code generation, leading to limited transferability and manual
re-tuning. We introduce Memory Transfer Planning (MTP), a framework that
leverages successful control-code examples from different environments as
procedural knowledge, using them as in-context guidance for LLM-driven
planning. Specifically, MTP (i) generates an initial plan and code using LLMs,
(ii) retrieves relevant successful examples from a code memory, and (iii)
contextually adapts the retrieved code to the target setting for re-planning
without updating model parameters. We evaluate MTP on RLBench, CALVIN, and a
physical robot, demonstrating effectiveness beyond simulation. Across these
settings, MTP consistently improved success rate and adaptability compared with
fixed-prompt code generation, naive retrieval, and memory-free re-planning.
Furthermore, in hardware experiments, leveraging a memory constructed in
simulation proved effective. MTP provides a practical approach that exploits
procedural knowledge to realize robust LLM-based planning across diverse
robotic manipulation scenarios, enhancing adaptability to novel environments
and bridging simulation and real-world deployment.

Conclusion: 通过多模态输入和基于堆叠偏好的自定义数据集微调，可以显著提升LLM在需要物理属性推理的长期机器人堆叠任务中的规划能力。

Abstract: Pretrained large language models (LLMs) can work as high-level robotic
planners by reasoning over abstract task descriptions and natural language
instructions, etc. However, they have shown a lack of knowledge and
effectiveness in planning long-horizon robotic manipulation tasks where the
physical properties of the objects are essential. An example is the stacking of
containers with hidden objects inside, which involves reasoning over hidden
physics properties such as weight and stability. To this end, this paper
proposes to use multimodal LLMs as high-level planners for such long-horizon
robotic stacking tasks. The LLM takes multimodal inputs for each object to
stack and infers the current best stacking sequence by reasoning over stacking
preferences. Furthermore, in order to enable the LLM to reason over multiple
preferences at the same time without giving explicit instructions, we propose
to create a custom dataset considering stacking preferences including weight,
stability, size, and footprint, to fine-tune the LLM. Compared to the
pretrained LLM with prompt tuning, we demonstrate the improved stacking
completion of the LLM fine-tuned with our custom dataset via large-scale
simulation evaluation. Furthermore, we showcase the effectiveness of the
proposed framework for the long-horizon stacking task on a real humanoid robot
in an online manner.

We use this to interpolate non-linear schemes during real-world execution, such

TL;DR: ViReSkill是一个结合视觉重规划和技能记忆的框架，通过LLMs/VLMs进行运动规划，在失败时重新规划，成功时存储技能供后续重用，实现自主持续学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RL/IL方法适应新任务慢，而LLMs/VLMs虽然知识丰富但存在两个问题：(i)符号规划缺乏场景几何和物体物理基础，(ii)模型输出不稳定影响执行可靠性。

Method: 提出ViReSkill框架，包含视觉重规划和技能记忆。失败时基于当前场景重新规划动作序列，成功时将执行计划存储为可重用技能，未来无需调用LLMs/VLMs即可重放。

Result: 在LIBERO、RLBench等模拟器和真实机器人上评估，ViReSkill在任务成功率上持续优于传统基线方法，展示了鲁棒的仿真到真实泛化能力。

Conclusion: ViReSkill通过反馈循环实现自主持续学习，每次尝试都能扩展技能集并稳定后续执行，为解决LLMs/VLMs在运动规划中的落地障碍提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Robots trained via Reinforcement Learning (RL) or Imitation Learning (IL)
often adapt slowly to new tasks, whereas recent Large Language Models (LLMs)
and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) promise knowledge-rich planning from minimal
data. Deploying LLMs/VLMs for motion planning, however, faces two key
obstacles: (i) symbolic plans are rarely grounded in scene geometry and object
physics, and (ii) model outputs can vary for identical prompts, undermining
execution reliability. We propose ViReSkill, a framework that pairs
vision-grounded replanning with a skill memory for accumulation and reuse. When
a failure occurs, the replanner generates a new action sequence conditioned on
the current scene, tailored to the observed state. On success, the executed
plan is stored as a reusable skill and replayed in future encounters without
additional calls to LLMs/VLMs. This feedback loop enables autonomous continual
learning: each attempt immediately expands the skill set and stabilizes
subsequent executions. We evaluate ViReSkill on simulators such as LIBERO and
RLBench as well as on a physical robot. Across all settings, it consistently
outperforms conventional baselines in task success rate, demonstrating robust
sim-to-real generalization.

Motivation: 传统逻辑树方法在时序逻辑规划中存在约束数量多、凸松弛质量差的问题，需要更高效的规划框架

Method: 采用网络流模型，将时序谓词编码为边上的多面体约束，提出基于网络流的Fourier-Motzkin消元方法去除连续流变量

Result: 在车辆路径规划、多机器人协调、时序逻辑控制等任务中，计算速度提升数个数量级，四足机器人硬件验证了实时重规划能力

Conclusion: 逻辑网络流框架在时序逻辑规划中实现了更紧的凸松弛和更少的约束，显著提升了计算效率

Abstract: This paper proposes an optimization-based task and motion planning framework,
named "Logic Network Flow", that integrates temporal logic specifications into
mixed-integer programs for efficient robot planning. Inspired by the
Graph-of-Convex-Sets formulation, temporal predicates are encoded as polyhedron
constraints on each edge of a network flow model, instead of as constraints
between nodes in traditional Logic Tree formulations. We further propose a
network-flow-based Fourier-Motzkin elimination procedure that removes
continuous flow variables while preserving convex relaxation tightness, leading
to provably tighter convex relaxations and fewer constraints than Logic Tree
formulations. For temporal logic motion planning with piecewise-affine dynamic
systems, comprehensive experiments across vehicle routing, multi-robot
coordination, and temporal logic control on dynamical systems using point mass
and linear inverted pendulum models demonstrate computational speedups of up to
several orders of magnitude. Hardware demonstrations with quadrupedal robots
validate real-time replanning capabilities under dynamically changing
environmental conditions. The project website is at

Motivation: 解决RGB-D SLAM系统在相机大视角变化、快速运动或突然抖动时的失效问题，结合学习方法的鲁棒性和优化方法的高精度优势。

Method: 使用相机姿态回归网络从连续RGB-D帧预测度量感知的相对位姿，作为随机优化算法的可靠起点，进一步将深度图像与场景几何对齐。

Result: 在挑战性基准测试中优于最佳竞争对手，在稳定运动序列上保持相当精度，系统可实时运行。

Conclusion: 结合简单而原理性技术可同时实现不稳定运动下的鲁棒性和稠密重建的精度。

Abstract: Real-time dense scene reconstruction during unstable camera motions is
crucial for robotics, yet current RGB-D SLAM systems fail when cameras
experience large viewpoint changes, fast motions, or sudden shaking. Classical
optimization-based methods deliver high accuracy but fail with poor
initialization during large motions, while learning-based approaches provide
robustness but lack sufficient accuracy for dense reconstruction. We address
this challenge through a combination of learning-based initialization with
optimization-based refinement. Our method employs a camera pose regression
network to predict metric-aware relative poses from consecutive RGB-D frames,
which serve as reliable starting points for a randomized optimization algorithm
that further aligns depth images with the scene geometry. Extensive experiments
demonstrate promising results: our approach outperforms the best competitor on
challenging benchmarks, while maintaining comparable accuracy on stable motion
sequences. The system operates in real-time, showcasing that combining simple
and principled techniques can achieve both robustness for unstable motions and
accuracy for dense reconstruction. Project page:

TL;DR: SafeFlowMatcher结合流匹配与控制屏障函数，通过预测-校正积分器实现实时高效且具有安全保证的路径规划。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于流匹配的生成规划器虽然能快速生成高质量路径，但缺乏形式化安全保证，且在约束附近可能产生不完整路径。

Method: 采用两阶段预测-校正积分器：预测阶段通过流匹配生成候选路径；校正阶段使用时间缩放向量场和基于控制屏障函数的二次规划进行微调。

Result: 在迷宫导航和运动基准测试中，SafeFlowMatcher比基于扩散和流匹配的基线方法获得更快、更平滑、更安全的路径。

Conclusion: 该框架通过仅在执行路径上强制安全约束，避免了分布漂移和局部陷阱问题，同时提供了安全集的正向不变性和有限时间收敛性的形式化证明。

Abstract: Generative planners based on flow matching (FM) can produce high-quality
paths in one or a few ODE steps, but their sampling dynamics offer no formal
safety guarantees and can yield incomplete paths near constraints. We present
SafeFlowMatcher, a planning framework that couples FM with control barrier
functions (CBFs) to achieve both real-time efficiency and certified safety.
SafeFlowMatcher uses a two-phase prediction-correction (PC) integrator: (i) a
prediction phase integrates the learned FM once (or a few steps) to obtain a
candidate path without intervention; (ii) a correction phase refines this path
with a vanishing time-scaled vector field and a CBF-based quadratic program
that minimally perturbs the vector field. We prove a barrier certificate for
the resulting flow system, establishing forward invariance of a robust safe set
and finite-time convergence to the safe set. By enforcing safety only on the
executed path (rather than on all intermediate latent paths), SafeFlowMatcher
avoids distributional drift and mitigates local trap problems. Across maze
navigation and locomotion benchmarks, SafeFlowMatcher attains faster, smoother,
and safer paths than diffusion- and FM-based baselines. Extensive ablations
corroborate the contributions of the PC integrator and the barrier certificate.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于贝叶斯优化和高斯过程的上下文选择策略，用于四旋翼飞行器的自适应控制，通过在关键环境中收集数据来训练神经网络参数，避免在所有环境中进行训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 四旋翼飞行器的自适应控制器需要估计扰动以实现鲁棒轨迹跟踪，但在不同环境条件下估计扰动具有挑战性。传统方法需要针对特定场景进行大量调优，缺乏灵活性。机器学习方法虽然前景广阔，但无法在所有可能环境中收集数据。

Method: 使用贝叶斯优化和高斯过程来选择需要收集数据的环境上下文，训练神经网络动态调整估计器参数，避免在所有环境中进行训练。

Result: 在多种真实世界设置中的实验结果表明，该方法在最大绝对位置误差方面比先前工作提高了20.3%，并且能够通过少量精心选择的上下文捕捉环境变化。

Conclusion: Contextual NeuroMHE方法消除了在所有环境中进行详尽训练的需求，同时在不同条件下保持鲁棒性能，通过动态调整神经网络参数提高了效率和泛化能力。

Abstract: Adaptive controllers on quadrotors typically rely on estimation of
disturbances to ensure robust trajectory tracking. Estimating disturbances
across diverse environmental contexts is challenging due to the inherent
variability and uncertainty in the real world. Such estimators require
extensive fine-tuning for a specific scenario, which makes them inflexible and
brittle to changing conditions. Machine-learning approaches, such as training a
neural network to tune the estimator's parameters, are promising. However,
collecting data across all possible environmental contexts is impossible. It is
also inefficient as the same estimator parameters could work for "nearby"
contexts. In this paper, we present a sequential decision making strategy that
decides which environmental contexts, using Bayesian Optimization with a
Gaussian Process, to collect data from in order to ensure robust performance
across a wide range of contexts. Our method, Contextual NeuroMHE, eliminates
the need for exhaustive training across all environments while maintaining
robust performance under different conditions. By enabling the neural network
to adapt its parameters dynamically, our method improves both efficiency and
generalization. Experimental results in various real-world settings demonstrate
that our approach outperforms the prior work by 20.3\% in terms of maximum
absolute position error and can capture the variations in the environment with
a few carefully chosen contexts.

Result: 在CommonRoad仿真环境中评估，所需样本减少99%，运行时间减少84%，同时保持规划成功率和无碰撞率。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了更快、更可靠的自动驾驶决策，在现实世界约束下实现更安全、更响应的导航。

Abstract: Sampling-based motion planning is a well-established approach in autonomous
driving, valued for its modularity and analytical tractability. In complex
urban scenarios, however, uniform or heuristic sampling often produces many
infeasible or irrelevant trajectories. We address this limitation with a hybrid
framework that learns where to sample while keeping trajectory generation and
evaluation fully analytical and verifiable. A reinforcement learning (RL) agent
guides the sampling process toward regions of the action space likely to yield
feasible trajectories, while evaluation and final selection remains governed by
deterministic feasibility checks and cost functions. We couple the RL sampler
with a world model (WM) based on a decodable deep set encoder, enabling both
variable numbers of traffic participants and reconstructable latent
representations. The approach is evaluated in the CommonRoad simulation
environment, showing up to 99% fewer required samples and a runtime reduction
of up to 84% while maintaining planning quality in terms of success and
collision-free rates. These improvements lead to faster, more reliable
decision-making for autonomous vehicles in urban environments, achieving safer
and more responsive navigation under real-world constraints. Code and trained
artifacts are publicly available at:

Result: 在Gazebo模拟器中使用MP3D数据集评估，SONAR实现了38.4%的成功率和17.7%的SPL。

Conclusion: SONAR方法在未知环境中具有更好的鲁棒性，能有效平衡泛化能力和场景适应性。

Abstract: Understanding human instructions and accomplishing Vision-Language Navigation
tasks in unknown environments is essential for robots. However, existing
modular approaches heavily rely on the quality of training data and often
exhibit poor generalization. Vision-Language Model based methods, while
demonstrating strong generalization capabilities, tend to perform
unsatisfactorily when semantic cues are weak. To address these issues, this
paper proposes SONAR, an aggregated reasoning approach through a cross modal
paradigm. The proposed method integrates a semantic map based target prediction
module with a Vision-Language Model based value map module, enabling more
robust navigation in unknown environments with varying levels of semantic cues,
and effectively balancing generalization ability with scene adaptability. In
terms of target localization, we propose a strategy that integrates multi-scale
semantic maps with confidence maps, aiming to mitigate false detections of
target objects. We conducted an evaluation of the SONAR within the Gazebo
simulator, leveraging the most challenging Matterport 3D (MP3D) dataset as the
experimental benchmark. Experimental results demonstrate that SONAR achieves a
success rate of 38.4% and an SPL of 17.7%.

Motivation: 视觉语言导航需要代理在长序列视觉观察中遵循自然语言指令。固定步长的推理往往导致次优性能和冗余计算，需要自适应推理机制。

Result: 仅用6K训练样本，在R2R val-unseen上成功率提升20%，RxR-CE上提升11.7%，真实场景中提升11.4%，超越百万级数据训练的闭源模型。

Conclusion: AdaNav证明了在严格数据限制下，自适应推理策略能有效提升导航性能，为具身智能任务提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Vision Language Navigation (VLN) requires agents to follow natural language
instructions by grounding them in sequential visual observations over long
horizons. Explicit reasoning could enhance temporal consistency and perception
action alignment, but reasoning at fixed steps often leads to suboptimal
performance and unnecessary computation. To address this, we propose AdaNav, an
uncertainty-based adaptive reasoning framework for VLN. At its core is the
Uncertainty Adaptive Reasoning Block (UAR), a lightweight plugin that
dynamically triggers reasoning. We introduce Action Entropy as a policy prior
for UAR and progressively refine it through a Heuristics to RL training method,
enabling agents to learn difficulty aware reasoning policies under the strict
data limitations of embodied tasks. Results show that with only 6K training
samples, AdaNav achieves substantial gains over closed source models trained on
million scale data, improving success rate by 20% on R2R val-unseen, 11.7% on
RxR-CE, and 11.4% in real world scenes. The code is available at

Abstract: The emergence of large pre-trained models based on natural language has
breathed new life into robotics development. Extensive research has integrated
large models with robots, utilizing the powerful semantic understanding and
generation capabilities of large models to facilitate robot control through
natural language instructions gradually. However, we found that robots that
strictly adhere to human instructions, especially those containing misleading
information, may encounter errors during task execution, potentially leading to
safety hazards. This resembles the concept of counterfactuals in natural
language processing (NLP), which has not yet attracted much attention in
robotic research. In an effort to highlight this issue for future studies, this
paper introduced directive counterfactuals (DCFs) arising from misleading human
directives. We present DynaMIC, a framework for generating robot task flows to
identify DCFs and relay feedback to humans proactively. This capability can
help robots be sensitive to potential DCFs within a task, thus enhancing the
reliability of the execution process. We conducted semantic-level experiments
and ablation studies, showcasing the effectiveness of this framework.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have achieved notable success but often
struggle with limited generalizations. To address this, integrating generalized
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) as assistants to VLAs has emerged as a popular
solution. However, current approaches often combine these models in rigid,
sequential structures: using VLMs primarily for high-level scene understanding
and task planning, and VLAs merely as executors of lower-level actions, leading
to ineffective collaboration and poor grounding challenges. In this paper, we
propose an embodied agent framework, PhysiAgent, tailored to operate
effectively in physical environments. By incorporating monitor, memory,
self-reflection mechanisms, and lightweight off-the-shelf toolboxes, PhysiAgent
offers an autonomous scaffolding framework to prompt VLMs to organize different
components based on real-time proficiency feedback from VLAs to maximally
exploit VLAs' capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate significant
improvements in task-solving performance on complex real-world robotic tasks,
showcasing effective self-regulation of VLMs, coherent tool collaboration, and
adaptive evolution of the framework during execution. PhysiAgent makes
practical and pioneering efforts to integrate VLMs and VLAs, effectively
grounding embodied agent frameworks in real-world settings.

Abstract: In this study, we explore the potential of Game Theory as a means to
investigate cooperation and trust in human-robot mixed groups. Particularly, we
introduce the Public Good Game (PGG), a model highlighting the tension between
individual self-interest and collective well-being. In this work, we present a
modified version of the PGG, where three human participants engage in the game
with the humanoid robot iCub to assess whether various robot game strategies
(e.g., always cooperate, always free ride, and tit-for-tat) can influence the
participants' inclination to cooperate. We test our setup during a pilot study
with nineteen participants. A preliminary analysis indicates that participants
prefer not to invest their money in the common pool, despite they perceive the
robot as generous. By conducting this research, we seek to gain valuable
insights into the role that robots can play in promoting trust and cohesion
during human-robot interactions within group contexts. The results of this
study may hold considerable potential for developing social robots capable of
fostering trust and cooperation within mixed human-robot groups.

Conclusion: 离线策略的模仿学习框架在机器人运动生成方面具有重要潜力，能够实现更自然的行为和任务执行。

Abstract: Learning-based methods have enabled robots to acquire bio-inspired movements
with increasing levels of naturalness and adaptability. Among these, Imitation
Learning (IL) has proven effective in transferring complex motion patterns from
animals to robotic systems. However, current state-of-the-art frameworks
predominantly rely on Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), an on-policy
algorithm that prioritizes stability over sample efficiency and policy
generalization. This paper proposes a novel IL framework that combines
Adversarial Motion Priors (AMP) with the off-policy Soft Actor-Critic (SAC)
algorithm to overcome these limitations. This integration leverages
replay-driven learning and entropy-regularized exploration, enabling
naturalistic behavior and task execution, improving data efficiency and
robustness. We evaluate the proposed approach (AMP+SAC) on quadruped gaits
involving multiple reference motions and diverse terrains. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed framework not only maintains stable task
execution but also achieves higher imitation rewards compared to the widely
used AMP+PPO method. These findings highlight the potential of an off-policy IL
formulation for advancing motion generation in robotics.

Abstract: This paper presents a framework towards prompting multi-robot teams with
high-level tasks using natural language expressions. Our objective is to use
the reasoning capabilities demonstrated by recent language models in
understanding and decomposing human expressions of intent, and repurpose these
for multi-robot collaboration and decision-making. The key challenge is that an
individual's behavior in a collective can be hard to specify and interpret, and
must continuously adapt to actions from others. This necessitates a framework
that possesses the representational capacity required by the logic and
semantics of a task, and yet supports decentralized and interactive real-time
operation. We solve this dilemma by recognizing that a task can be represented
as a deterministic finite automaton (DFA), and that recurrent neural networks
(RNNs) can encode numerous automata. This allows us to distill the logic and
sequential decompositions of sub-tasks obtained from a language model into an

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出U-DiT Policy，一种U形扩散Transformer框架，结合U-Net的多尺度特征融合优势和Transformer的全局上下文建模能力，在机器人操作任务中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于扩散的机器人控制方法主要采用U-Net架构(DP-U)，存在全局上下文建模能力有限和过度平滑伪影的问题，需要改进。

Method: 提出U形扩散Transformer框架(U-DiT)，保留U-Net的多尺度特征融合优势，同时集成Transformer的全局上下文建模能力。

Result: 在仿真中平均性能提升10%，比基于Transformer的扩散策略(DP-T)高6%；在真实机器人任务中平均提升22.5%，在干扰和光照变化下表现出更好的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: U-DiT Policy作为基于扩散的机器人操作新基础，展示了有效性和实际潜力。

Abstract: Diffusion-based methods have been acknowledged as a powerful paradigm for
end-to-end visuomotor control in robotics. Most existing approaches adopt a
Diffusion Policy in U-Net architecture (DP-U), which, while effective, suffers
from limited global context modeling and over-smoothing artifacts. To address
these issues, we propose U-DiT Policy, a novel U-shaped Diffusion Transformer
framework. U-DiT preserves the multi-scale feature fusion advantages of U-Net
while integrating the global context modeling capability of Transformers,
thereby enhancing representational power and policy expressiveness. We evaluate
U-DiT extensively across both simulation and real-world robotic manipulation
tasks. In simulation, U-DiT achieves an average performance gain of 10\% over
baseline methods and surpasses Transformer-based diffusion policies (DP-T) that
use AdaLN blocks by 6\% under comparable parameter budgets. On real-world
robotic tasks, U-DiT demonstrates superior generalization and robustness,
achieving an average improvement of 22.5\% over DP-U. In addition, robustness
and generalization experiments under distractor and lighting variations further
highlight the advantages of U-DiT. These results highlight the effectiveness
and practical potential of U-DiT Policy as a new foundation for diffusion-based
robotic manipulation.

Motivation: 解决传统机器人系统中感知和控制分离的多阶段流程问题，实现更高效、可扩展的感知与控制集成。

Method: 使用条件扩散模型，从单张RGB图像映射到结构化机器人状态（3D关键点或关节角度），并基于世界模型生成的关键帧通过重叠平均策略产生平滑的长期动作序列。

Result: 在DREAM数据集上达到最先进的姿态估计精度和实时性能；在Libero-Object操作任务中显著提升成功率，即使在严格离线设置下也表现优异。

Conclusion: PoseDiff为具身AI中的感知、规划和控制提供了一个可扩展、准确且高效的桥梁。

Abstract: We present PoseDiff, a conditional diffusion model that unifies robot state
estimation and control within a single framework. At its core, PoseDiff maps
raw visual observations into structured robot states-such as 3D keypoints or
joint angles-from a single RGB image, eliminating the need for multi-stage
pipelines or auxiliary modalities. Building upon this foundation, PoseDiff
extends naturally to video-to-action inverse dynamics: by conditioning on
sparse video keyframes generated by world models, it produces smooth and
continuous long-horizon action sequences through an overlap-averaging strategy.
This unified design enables scalable and efficient integration of perception
and control. On the DREAM dataset, PoseDiff achieves state-of-the-art accuracy
and real-time performance for pose estimation. On Libero-Object manipulation
tasks, it substantially improves success rates over existing inverse dynamics
modules, even under strict offline settings. Together, these results show that
PoseDiff provides a scalable, accurate, and efficient bridge between
perception, planning, and control in embodied AI. The video visualization

Abstract: Cross-embodiment dexterous grasp synthesis refers to adaptively generating
and optimizing grasps for various robotic hands with different morphologies.
This capability is crucial for achieving versatile robotic manipulation in
diverse environments and requires substantial amounts of reliable and diverse
grasp data for effective model training and robust generalization. However,
existing approaches either rely on physics-based optimization that lacks
human-like kinematic understanding or require extensive manual data collection
processes that are limited to anthropomorphic structures. In this paper, we
propose CEDex, a novel cross-embodiment dexterous grasp synthesis method at
scale that bridges human grasping kinematics and robot kinematics by aligning
robot kinematic models with generated human-like contact representations. Given
an object's point cloud and an arbitrary robotic hand model, CEDex first
generates human-like contact representations using a Conditional Variational
Auto-encoder pretrained on human contact data. It then performs kinematic human
contact alignment through topological merging to consolidate multiple human
hand parts into unified robot components, followed by a signed distance
field-based grasp optimization with physics-aware constraints. Using CEDex, we
construct the largest cross-embodiment grasp dataset to date, comprising 500K
objects across four gripper types with 20M total grasps. Extensive experiments
show that CEDex outperforms state-of-the-art approaches and our dataset
benefits cross-embodiment grasp learning with high-quality diverse grasps.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模仿学习方法受限于数据量且缺乏物理知识，可能导致轨迹发散和滑动接触问题，影响真实世界稳定性

Method: 1. 在监督模仿学习中编码物理先验以促进轨迹可行性；2. 在推理时应用比例积分控制器最小化漂移

Result: 在ergoCub人形机器人上验证，物理感知损失鼓励零接触脚速度，显著提高轨迹精度和物理约束符合度

Conclusion: 该方法兼容多种控制器，能有效改善生成轨迹的准确性和物理约束一致性

Abstract: Recent trends in humanoid robot control have successfully employed imitation
learning to enable the learned generation of smooth, human-like trajectories
from human data. While these approaches make more realistic motions possible,
they are limited by the amount of available motion data, and do not incorporate
prior knowledge about the physical laws governing the system and its
interactions with the environment. Thus they may violate such laws, leading to
divergent trajectories and sliding contacts which limit real-world stability.
We address such limitations via a two-pronged learning strategy which leverages
the known physics of the system and fundamental control principles. First, we
encode physics priors during supervised imitation learning to promote
trajectory feasibility. Second, we minimize drift at inference time by applying
a proportional-integral controller directly to the generated output state. We
validate our method on various locomotion behaviors for the ergoCub humanoid
robot, where a physics-informed loss encourages zero contact foot velocity. Our
experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach is compatible with multiple
controllers on a real robot and significantly improves the accuracy and
physical constraint conformity of generated trajectories.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法往往忽视人类在交接后的动作，依赖限制泛化能力的假设。需要开发能够理解交接后任务约束的上下文感知交接系统。

Method: 结合LLM推理和部件分割，给定RGB-D图像和任务描述，系统推断相关物体部件并选择优化交接后可用性的抓取方式。

Result: 在零样本设置下，在常规和非常规交接后任务中达到83%的成功率；用户研究表明86%的参与者更偏好该方法。

Conclusion: LLM-Handover能够实现更直观、上下文感知的物体交接，显著提升人机协作效果。

Abstract: Effective human-robot collaboration depends on task-oriented handovers, where
robots present objects in ways that support the partners intended use. However,
many existing approaches neglect the humans post-handover action, relying on
assumptions that limit generalizability. To address this gap, we propose
LLM-Handover, a novel framework that integrates large language model
(LLM)-based reasoning with part segmentation to enable context-aware grasp
selection and execution. Given an RGB-D image and a task description, our
system infers relevant object parts and selects grasps that optimize
post-handover usability. To support evaluation, we introduce a new dataset of
60 household objects spanning 12 categories, each annotated with detailed part
labels. We first demonstrate that our approach improves the performance of the
used state-of-the-art part segmentation method, in the context of robot-human
handovers. Next, we show that LLM-Handover achieves higher grasp success rates
and adapts better to post-handover task constraints. During hardware
experiments, we achieve a success rate of 83% in a zero-shot setting over
conventional and unconventional post-handover tasks. Finally, our user study
underlines that our method enables more intuitive, context-aware handovers,
with participants preferring it in 86% of cases.

Abstract: Reliable onboard perception is critical for quadruped robots navigating
dynamic environments, where obstacles can emerge from any direction under
strict reaction-time constraints. Single-sensor systems face inherent
limitations: LiDAR provides omnidirectional coverage but lacks rich texture
information, while cameras capture high-resolution detail but suffer from
restricted field of view. We introduce APREBot (Active Perception System for

with active hierarchical perception. APREBot strategically combines LiDAR-based
omnidirectional scanning with camera-based active focusing, achieving
comprehensive environmental awareness essential for agile obstacle avoidance in

on a quadruped platform, evaluating diverse obstacle types, trajectories, and
approach directions. Our results demonstrate substantial improvements over
state-of-the-art baselines in both safety metrics and operational efficiency,

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SSR-ZSON是一种基于TARE分层探索框架的空间语义相对零样本物体导航方法，通过平衡空间覆盖和语义密度的视点生成策略与基于LLM的全局引导机制，解决了零样本物体导航中的语义引导不足和空间记忆限制问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 零样本物体导航面临两个主要挑战：语义引导不足导致探索效率低下，环境结构导致的空间记忆限制使智能体容易陷入局部区域。

Method: 提出SSR-ZSON方法，包含两个关键创新：1）视点生成策略优先考虑可遍历子区域内高语义密度区域以最大化空间覆盖；2）基于LLM的全局引导机制评估语义关联，引导导航朝向高价值空间。

Result: 在Matterport3D和Habitat-Matterport3D数据集上，相比最先进方法，成功率分别提高18.5%和11.2%，路径长度加权成功率分别提高0.181和0.140。

Conclusion: SSR-ZSON实现了实时操作和优越性能，通过平衡空间覆盖与语义密度的视点生成和LLM全局引导，有效解决了零样本物体导航中的探索效率低下和局部陷阱问题。

Abstract: Zero-shot object navigation in unknown environments presents significant
challenges, mainly due to two key limitations: insufficient semantic guidance
leads to inefficient exploration, while limited spatial memory resulting from
environmental structure causes entrapment in local regions. To address these
issues, we propose SSR-ZSON, a spatial-semantic relative zero-shot object
navigation method based on the TARE hierarchical exploration framework,
integrating a viewpoint generation strategy balancing spatial coverage and
semantic density with an LLM-based global guidance mechanism. The performance
improvement of the proposed method is due to two key innovations. First, the
viewpoint generation strategy prioritizes areas of high semantic density within
traversable sub-regions to maximize spatial coverage and minimize invalid
exploration. Second, coupled with an LLM-based global guidance mechanism, it
assesses semantic associations to direct navigation toward high-value spaces,
preventing local entrapment and ensuring efficient exploration. Deployed on
hybrid Habitat-Gazebo simulations and physical platforms, SSR-ZSON achieves
real-time operation and superior performance. On Matterport3D and
Habitat-Matterport3D datasets, it improves the Success Rate(SR) by 18.5\% and
11.2\%, and the Success weighted by Path Length(SPL) by 0.181 and 0.140,
respectively, over state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: IA-VLA框架利用大型视觉语言模型的强大语言理解能力作为预处理阶段，为视觉语言动作模型(VLA)生成改进的上下文输入，以处理需要复杂语言指令的机器人操作任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLA模型由于需要实时输出动作，限制了语言模型的规模，导致处理复杂语言指令(如通过相对位置识别目标物体)的能力不足。

Method: 使用大型视觉语言模型作为预处理阶段生成增强上下文，然后输入到VLA中处理视觉重复物体等复杂语义任务。

Result: 在包含重复物体的场景数据集上测试，增强后的VLA性能显著提升，特别是在需要从演示概念进行外推的语言指令任务中。

Conclusion: IA-VLA框架有效提升了VLA处理复杂语义任务的能力，特别是在处理视觉重复物体和需要语言理解外推的场景中表现优异。

Abstract: Vision-language-action models (VLAs) have become an increasingly popular
approach for addressing robot manipulation problems in recent years. However,
such models need to output actions at a rate suitable for robot control, which
limits the size of the language model they can be based on, and consequently,
their language understanding capabilities. Manipulation tasks may require
complex language instructions, such as identifying target objects by their
relative positions, to specify human intention. Therefore, we introduce IA-VLA,
a framework that utilizes the extensive language understanding of a large
vision language model as a pre-processing stage to generate improved context to
augment the input of a VLA. We evaluate the framework on a set of semantically
complex tasks which have been underexplored in VLA literature, namely tasks
involving visual duplicates, i.e., visually indistinguishable objects. A
dataset of three types of scenes with duplicate objects is used to compare a
baseline VLA against two augmented variants. The experiments show that the VLA
benefits from the augmentation scheme, especially when faced with language
instructions that require the VLA to extrapolate from concepts it has seen in
the demonstrations. For the code, dataset, and videos, see

Motivation: 大规模训练的通用机器人策略容易受到捷径学习的影响，导致分布外泛化能力差。传统生成数据增强方法虽然引入多样性，但可能损害信息保真度。

Method: 提出CIFT框架，将数据组合视为优化问题，使用基于特征空间几何的信息保真度代理，识别训练稳定性下降的解相干点，并开发MVAug生成引擎合成因果解缠的数据谱。

Result: 在π₀和Diffusion Policy等策略架构上应用CIFT，分布外成功率提高了54%以上。

Conclusion: 保真度感知的数据组合，而不仅仅是数据合成，是开发鲁棒通用机器人的重要组成部分。

Abstract: Generalist robot policies trained on large-scale, visually homogeneous
datasets can be susceptible to shortcut learning, which impairs their
out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. While generative data augmentation is
a common approach to introduce diversity, it presents a subtle challenge: data
composition. Naively mixing real and synthetic data can corrupt the learning
signal, as this process often prioritizes visual diversity at the expense of
information fidelity. This paper suggests that robust generalization depends on
principled, fidelity-aware data composition. We introduce Coherent Information
Fidelity Tuning (CIFT), a framework that treats data composition as an
optimization problem. CIFT uses a practical proxy for Information Fidelity
based on the feature-space geometry of a dataset. This enables the
identification of a phase transition, termed the Decoherence Point, where
training stability degrades. The framework includes a generative engine,
Multi-View Video Augmentation (MVAug), to synthesize a causally disentangled
data spectrum for this tuning process. Applying CIFT to policy architectures
such as $\pi_0$ and Diffusion Policy improves OOD success rates by over 54\%.
These results indicate that fidelity-aware composition, beyond data synthesis
alone, is an important component for developing robust, general-purpose robots.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于机器人安装2D LiDAR的方法，用于自动估计超声心动图检查的初始探头姿态，以解决远程机器人超声检查时间较长的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 远程机器人超声心动图检查虽然解决了偏远地区缺乏专业超声技师的问题，但临床研究表明其检查时间比手动操作更长，增加了诊断延迟和操作员负担。现有基于视觉和深度的初始探头姿态估计方法对光照、纹理和解剖变异敏感。

Method: 使用机器人安装的2D LiDAR重建胸部3D表面，通过基于平面的外部校准估计LiDAR与机器人基座坐标系之间的变换，然后通过非刚性模板配准识别初始探头姿态。

Result: 外部校准的RMS残差为1.8mm，旋转不确定性低于0.2度。人体模型研究显示平均表面误差为2.78±0.21mm。人体试验中，初始探头点与临床定义点的距离通常为20-30mm，同一受试者重复试验的变异小于4mm。

Conclusion: 基于2D LiDAR的方法能够准确重建人体表面并自动估计超声探头初始姿态，为减少远程机器人超声检查时间提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Echocardiography is a key imaging modality for cardiac assessment but remains
highly operator-dependent, and access to trained sonographers is limited in
underserved settings. Teleoperated robotic echocardiography has been proposed
as a solution; however, clinical studies report longer examination times than
manual procedures, increasing diagnostic delays and operator workload.
Automating non-expert tasks, such as automatically moving the probe to an ideal
starting pose, offers a pathway to reduce this burden. Prior vision- and
depth-based approaches to estimate an initial probe pose are sensitive to
lighting, texture, and anatomical variability. We propose a robot-mounted 2D
LiDAR-based approach that reconstructs the chest surface in 3D and estimates
the initial probe pose automatically. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first demonstration of robot-mounted 2D LiDAR used for 3D reconstruction of a
human body surface. Through plane-based extrinsic calibration, the
transformation between the LiDAR and robot base frames was estimated with an
overall root mean square (RMS) residual of 1.8 mm and rotational uncertainty
below 0.2{\deg}. The chest front surface, reconstructed from two linear LiDAR
sweeps, was aligned with non-rigid templates to identify an initial probe pose.
A mannequin-based study assessing reconstruction accuracy showed mean surface
errors of 2.78 +/- 0.21 mm. Human trials (N=5) evaluating the proposed approach
found probe initial points typically 20-30 mm from the clinically defined
initial point, while the variation across repeated trials on the same subject
was less than 4 mm.

Motivation: 空中机器人与物体交互需要在不确定性下执行精确、接触丰富的操作。空中球类杂耍任务需要准确的时机、稳定的控制和持续适应能力。

Conclusion: 这项工作表明强化学习能够赋予空中机器人在动态交互任务中实现鲁棒和稳定的控制。

Abstract: Aerial robots interacting with objects must perform precise, contact-rich
maneuvers under uncertainty. In this paper, we study the problem of aerial ball
juggling using a quadrotor equipped with a racket, a task that demands accurate
timing, stable control, and continuous adaptation. We propose JuggleRL, the
first reinforcement learning-based system for aerial juggling. It learns
closed-loop policies in large-scale simulation using systematic calibration of
quadrotor and ball dynamics to reduce the sim-to-real gap. The training
incorporates reward shaping to encourage racket-centered hits and sustained
juggling, as well as domain randomization over ball position and coefficient of
restitution to enhance robustness and transferability. The learned policy
outputs mid-level commands executed by a low-level controller and is deployed
zero-shot on real hardware, where an enhanced perception module with a
lightweight communication protocol reduces delays in high-frequency state
estimation and ensures real-time control. Experiments show that JuggleRL
achieves an average of $311$ hits over $10$ consecutive trials in the real
world, with a maximum of $462$ hits observed, far exceeding a model-based
baseline that reaches at most $14$ hits with an average of $3.1$. Moreover, the
policy generalizes to unseen conditions, successfully juggling a lighter $5$ g
ball with an average of $145.9$ hits. This work demonstrates that reinforcement
learning can empower aerial robots with robust and stable control in dynamic
interaction tasks.

Abstract: Cooperative perception enabled by Vehicle-to-Everything communication has
shown great promise in enhancing situational awareness for autonomous vehicles
and other mobile robotic platforms. Despite recent advances in perception
backbones and multi-agent fusion, real-world deployments remain challenged by
hard detection cases, exemplified by partial detections and noise accumulation
which limit downstream detection accuracy. This work presents Diffusion on
Reinforced Cooperative Perception (DRCP), a real-time deployable framework
designed to address aforementioned issues in dynamic driving environments. DRCP
integrates two key components: (1) Precise-Pyramid-Cross-Modality-Cross-Agent,
a cross-modal cooperative perception module that leverages
camera-intrinsic-aware angular partitioning for attention-based fusion and
adaptive convolution to better exploit external features; and (2)
Mask-Diffusion-Mask-Aggregation, a novel lightweight diffusion-based refinement
module that encourages robustness against feature perturbations and aligns
bird's-eye-view features closer to the task-optimal manifold. The proposed
system achieves real-time performance on mobile platforms while significantly
improving robustness under challenging conditions. Code will be released in

Abstract: {Recognizing human interactions is essential for social robots as it enables
them to navigate safely and naturally in shared environments. Conventional
robotic systems however often focus on obstacle avoidance, neglecting social
cues necessary for seamless human-robot interaction. To address this gap, we
propose a framework to recognize human group interactions for socially aware
navigation. Our method utilizes color and depth frames from a monocular RGB-D
camera to estimate 3D human keypoints and positions. Principal component
analysis (PCA) is then used to determine dominant interaction directions. The
shoelace formula is finally applied to compute interest points and engagement
areas. Extensive experiments have been conducted to evaluate the validity of
the proposed method. The results show that our method is capable of recognizing
group interactions across different scenarios with varying numbers of
individuals. It also achieves high-speed performance, processing each frame in
approximately 4 ms on a single-board computer used in robotic systems. The
method is implemented as a ROS 2 package making it simple to integrate into
existing navigation systems. Source code is available at

### [450] [From Code to Action: Hierarchical Learning of Diffusion-VLM Policies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24917)
*Markus Peschl,Pietro Mazzaglia,Daniel Dijkman*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合代码生成视觉语言模型和扩散策略的分层框架，用于机器人模仿学习，通过将任务分解为可执行子程序并利用记忆机制处理非马尔可夫任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器人模仿学习在复杂长期任务中存在泛化能力有限和数据稀缺的问题，需要更有效的框架来提升泛化性和可解释性。

Method: 使用代码生成视觉语言模型将任务描述分解为可执行子程序，结合低层扩散策略模仿机器人行为，并引入记忆机制处理非马尔可夫任务。

Result: 该设计实现了可解释的策略分解，相比平面策略提高了泛化能力，并能分别评估高层规划和低层控制。

Conclusion: 分层框架通过结构化监督和记忆机制有效提升了机器人模仿学习的泛化性和可解释性。

Abstract: Imitation learning for robotic manipulation often suffers from limited
generalization and data scarcity, especially in complex, long-horizon tasks. In
this work, we introduce a hierarchical framework that leverages code-generating
vision-language models (VLMs) in combination with low-level diffusion policies
to effectively imitate and generalize robotic behavior. Our key insight is to
treat open-source robotic APIs not only as execution interfaces but also as
sources of structured supervision: the associated subtask functions - when
exposed - can serve as modular, semantically meaningful labels. We train a VLM
to decompose task descriptions into executable subroutines, which are then
grounded through a diffusion policy trained to imitate the corresponding robot
behavior. To handle the non-Markovian nature of both code execution and certain
real-world tasks, such as object swapping, our architecture incorporates a
memory mechanism that maintains subtask context across time. We find that this
design enables interpretable policy decomposition, improves generalization when
compared to flat policies and enables separate evaluation of high-level
planning and low-level control.

Conclusion: CineWild展示了工程、视觉叙事和环境伦理的跨学科创新，为野生动物纪录片制作提供了伦理与技术平衡的解决方案。

Abstract: Drones, or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), have become powerful tools across
domains-from industry to the arts. In documentary filmmaking, they offer
dynamic, otherwise unreachable perspectives, transforming how stories are told.
Wildlife documentaries especially benefit, yet drones also raise ethical
concerns: the risk of disturbing the animals they aim to capture. This paper
introduces CineWild, an autonomous UAV framework that combines robotics,
cinematography, and ethics. Built on model predictive control, CineWild
dynamically adjusts flight paths and camera settings to balance cinematic
quality with animal welfare. Key features include adaptive zoom for filming
from acoustic and visual safe distances, path-planning that avoids an animal's
field of view, and smooth, low-noise maneuvers. CineWild exemplifies
interdisciplinary innovation-bridging engineering, visual storytelling, and
environmental ethics. We validate the system through simulation studies and
will release the code upon acceptance.

TL;DR: 提出一种自适应贝叶斯算法，用于实时轨迹预测和意图推断，能够处理未知且可能变化的目标意图和运动特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在现实应用中，目标的意图和运动特性往往是未知且可能突然变化的，需要一种能够自适应处理这些不确定性的实时预测方法。

Method: 通过联合估计目标的当前意图（马尔可夫潜在状态）和意图参数（描述目标遵循最短路径策略的程度），结合采样轨迹预测机制生成概率预测。

Result: 数值实验和硬件演示表明，该方法在500次蒙特卡洛分析中显著优于非自适应和部分自适应方法，实时运行频率达270Hz。

Conclusion: 该方法无需训练或对目标行为的先验知识，在各种机器人系统中具有广泛适用性，能够有效处理意图突变和未知运动动力学。

Abstract: This work introduces an adaptive Bayesian algorithm for real-time trajectory
prediction via intention inference, where a target's intentions and motion
characteristics are unknown and subject to change. The method concurrently
estimates two critical variables: the target's current intention, modeled as a
Markovian latent state, and an intention parameter that describes the target's
adherence to a shortest-path policy. By integrating this joint update
technique, the algorithm maintains robustness against abrupt intention shifts
and unknown motion dynamics. A sampling-based trajectory prediction mechanism
then exploits these adaptive estimates to generate probabilistic forecasts with
quantified uncertainty. We validate the framework through numerical
experiments: Ablation studies of two cases, and a 500-trial Monte Carlo
analysis; Hardware demonstrations on quadrotor and quadrupedal platforms.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly
outperforms non-adaptive and partially adaptive methods. The method operates in
real time around 270 Hz without requiring training or detailed prior knowledge
of target behavior, showcasing its applicability in various robotic systems.

TL;DR: World-Env是一个基于强化学习的后训练框架，使用世界模型虚拟模拟器替代物理交互，解决VLA模型在数据稀缺场景下的性能下降问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLA模型在数据稀缺场景下性能显著下降，且真实世界环境不可重置特性限制了强化学习的应用，特别是在高风险工业自动化领域。现有VLA方法缺乏可靠的任务完成检测机制，导致冗余动作降低任务成功率。

Method: 提出World-Env框架，包含两个关键组件：基于视频的世界模拟器生成时间一致的未来视觉观察，以及VLM引导的即时反射器提供连续奖励信号并预测动作终止。

Result: 在复杂机器人操作任务上的实验表明，World-Env有效克服了传统VLA模型的数据效率低、安全约束和执行效率低的问题，每个任务仅需5个专家演示即可获得显著性能提升。

Conclusion: World-Env为资源受限环境下的后训练提供了实用且可扩展的解决方案，使VLA模型能够安全探索并超越初始模仿学习分布。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models trained via imitation learning suffer
from significant performance degradation in data-scarce scenarios due to their
reliance on large-scale demonstration datasets. Although reinforcement learning
(RL)-based post-training has proven effective in addressing data scarcity, its
application to VLA models is hindered by the non-resettable nature of
real-world environments. This limitation is particularly critical in high-risk
domains such as industrial automation, where interactions often induce state
changes that are costly or infeasible to revert. Furthermore, existing VLA
approaches lack a reliable mechanism for detecting task completion, leading to
redundant actions that reduce overall task success rates. To address these
challenges, we propose World-Env, an RL-based post-training framework that
replaces physical interaction with a low-cost, world model-based virtual
simulator. World-Env consists of two key components: (1) a video-based world
simulator that generates temporally consistent future visual observations, and
(2) a vision-language model (VLM)-guided instant reflector that provides
continuous reward signals and predicts action termination. This simulated
environment enables VLA models to safely explore and generalize beyond their
initial imitation learning distribution. Our method achieves notable
performance gains with as few as five expert demonstrations per task.
Experiments on complex robotic manipulation tasks demonstrate that World-Env
effectively overcomes the data inefficiency, safety constraints, and
inefficient execution of conventional VLA models that rely on real-world
interaction, offering a practical and scalable solution for post-training in
resource-constrained settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式机器人策略（如Flow Matching）虽然灵活且支持多模态，但样本效率低下。现有的以物体为中心的策略虽然有所改进，但未能从根本上解决这一问题。

Method: MSG是一个模型无关的推理时组合框架，训练多个以物体为中心的策略，在推理时将它们组合起来，从而提高泛化能力和样本效率。

Result: 实验表明，MSG仅需5个演示就能学习高质量策略，相比单流方法减少了95%的演示需求，并将策略性能提高了89%。同时支持零样本物体实例迁移。

Conclusion: MSG框架有效解决了生成式机器人策略的样本效率问题，具有广泛适用性，并通过全面的消融研究为实际部署提供了实用建议。

Abstract: Generative robot policies such as Flow Matching offer flexible, multi-modal
policy learning but are sample-inefficient. Although object-centric policies
improve sample efficiency, it does not resolve this limitation. In this work,
we propose Multi-Stream Generative Policy (MSG), an inference-time composition
framework that trains multiple object-centric policies and combines them at
inference to improve generalization and sample efficiency. MSG is
model-agnostic and inference-only, hence widely applicable to various
generative policies and training paradigms. We perform extensive experiments
both in simulation and on a real robot, demonstrating that our approach learns
high-quality generative policies from as few as five demonstrations, resulting
in a 95% reduction in demonstrations, and improves policy performance by 89
percent compared to single-stream approaches. Furthermore, we present
comprehensive ablation studies on various composition strategies and provide
practical recommendations for deployment. Finally, MSG enables zero-shot object
instance transfer. We make our code publicly available at

Motivation: 现有单次模仿学习方法在单步任务上表现良好，但在处理长时域多步骤任务时需要额外模型训练或手动标注，限制了实际应用。

Method: 基于单次演示的方法，无需额外模型训练或手动标注，能够处理多步骤长时域任务，并比较了不同预训练特征提取器的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法在无需额外训练或标注的情况下，能够有效处理多步骤长时域任务，性能优于现有基线方法。

Abstract: Recent advances in one-shot imitation learning have enabled robots to acquire
new manipulation skills from a single human demonstration. While existing
methods achieve strong performance on single-step tasks, they remain limited in
their ability to handle long-horizon, multi-step tasks without additional model
training or manual annotation. We propose a method that can be applied to this
setting provided a single demonstration without additional model training or
manual annotation. We evaluated our method on multi-step and single-step
manipulation tasks where our method achieves an average success rate of 82.5%
and 90%, respectively. Our method matches and exceeds the performance of the
baselines in both these cases. We also compare the performance and
computational efficiency of alternative pre-trained feature extractors within
our framework.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Path Diffuser是一个两阶段扩散模型，仅基于地图信息生成智能体姿态初始化和轨迹，无需历史轨迹数据，解决了传统方法在OOD地图场景下生成不现实轨迹的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于规则的方法缺乏多样性和真实性，而基于学习的方法依赖历史轨迹数据，难以生成新场景。现有方法需要智能体的历史轨迹和姿态信息，这在现实中可能不可用，导致在OOD地图场景下生成不现实的轨迹。

Method: 提出Path Diffuser：两阶段扩散模型，仅基于地图信息生成智能体姿态初始化和轨迹；结合基于运动基元的先验，利用Frenet框架候选轨迹增强多样性并确保道路合规；探索多种复杂多智能体交互建模设计选择。

Result: 在Argoverse2数据集上验证有效性，并在OOD地图变体上评估泛化能力。相比基线方法，在分布指标上提升1.92倍，常识指标上提升1.14倍，道路合规性上提升1.62倍。

Conclusion: Path Diffuser能够仅基于地图信息生成多样且现实的交通场景，无需历史轨迹数据，在OOD场景下表现优异，为自动驾驶规划测试提供了有效的仿真工具。

Abstract: Simulating diverse and realistic traffic scenarios is critical for developing
and testing autonomous planning. Traditional rule-based planners lack diversity
and realism, while learning-based simulators often replay, forecast, or edit
scenarios using historical agent trajectories. However, they struggle to
generate new scenarios, limiting scalability and diversity due to their
reliance on fully annotated logs and historical data. Thus, a key challenge for
a learning-based simulator's performance is that it requires agents' past
trajectories and pose information in addition to map data, which might not be
available for all agents on the road.Without which, generated scenarios often
produce unrealistic trajectories that deviate from drivable areas, particularly
under out-of-distribution (OOD) map scenes (e.g., curved roads). To address
this, we propose Path Diffuser (PD): a two-stage, diffusion model for
generating agent pose initializations and their corresponding trajectories
conditioned on the map, free of any historical context of agents' trajectories.
Furthermore, PD incorporates a motion primitive-based prior, leveraging Frenet
frame candidate trajectories to enhance diversity while ensuring road-compliant
trajectory generation. We also explore various design choices for modeling
complex multi-agent interactions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
method through extensive experiments on the Argoverse2 Dataset and additionally
evaluate the generalizability of the approach on OOD map variants. Notably,
Path Diffuser outperforms the baseline methods by 1.92x on distribution
metrics, 1.14x on common-sense metrics, and 1.62x on road compliance from
adversarial benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器人从受控环境转向非结构化的人类环境，构建能够可靠遵循自然语言指令的通用智能体仍然是一个核心挑战。鲁棒的移动操作需要大规模多模态数据集来捕捉接触丰富和长时程任务，但现有资源缺乏同步的力扭矩感知、分层注释和明确的失败案例。

Method: 开发了AIRoA MoMa数据集，包含25,469个片段（约94小时），使用人形支持机器人（HSR）收集，采用LeRobot v2.1格式标准化，并引入了新颖的两层注释模式（子目标和原始动作）。

Result: 数据集提供了同步的多模态数据，包括RGB图像、关节状态、六轴腕部力扭矩信号和机器人内部状态，为移动操作、接触丰富交互和长时程结构提供了独特的集成。

Conclusion: 通过独特地集成移动操作、接触丰富交互和长时程结构，AIRoA MoMa为推进下一代视觉-语言-动作模型提供了关键基准，数据集已在HuggingFace上发布。

Abstract: As robots transition from controlled settings to unstructured human
environments, building generalist agents that can reliably follow natural
language instructions remains a central challenge. Progress in robust mobile
manipulation requires large-scale multimodal datasets that capture contact-rich
and long-horizon tasks, yet existing resources lack synchronized force-torque
sensing, hierarchical annotations, and explicit failure cases. We address this
gap with the AIRoA MoMa Dataset, a large-scale real-world multimodal dataset
for mobile manipulation. It includes synchronized RGB images, joint states,
six-axis wrist force-torque signals, and internal robot states, together with a
novel two-layer annotation schema of sub-goals and primitive actions for
hierarchical learning and error analysis. The initial dataset comprises 25,469
episodes (approx. 94 hours) collected with the Human Support Robot (HSR) and is
fully standardized in the LeRobot v2.1 format. By uniquely integrating mobile
manipulation, contact-rich interaction, and long-horizon structure, AIRoA MoMa
provides a critical benchmark for advancing the next generation of
Vision-Language-Action models. The first version of our dataset is now
available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/airoa-org/airoa-moma .

Method: 使用可调节轨道宽度（1.42-1.57米）和高离地间隙（0.94米）的底盘设计，配备紧凑转向半径（0.71-0.79米），采用商品T型槽型材构建，成本约5000-6000美元。

Result: 在亚麻田实验中，单次机器人喷洒使杂草数量比人工除草减少24-42倍，作物损伤更少；在各种地形上均表现出可靠的通过性能。

Conclusion: 低成本、可重构的行间机器人能够实现有效的杂草管理，并为表型分析、传感等农业应用提供多功能平台，设计文件和实施细节已开源以加速研究采用。

Abstract: We present the AgriCruiser, an open-source over-the-row agricultural robot
developed for low-cost deployment and rapid adaptation across diverse crops and
row layouts. The chassis provides an adjustable track width of 1.42 m to 1.57
m, along with a ground clearance of 0.94 m. The AgriCruiser achieves compact
pivot turns with radii of 0.71 m to 0.79 m, enabling efficient headland
maneuvers. The platform is designed for the integration of the other
subsystems, and in this study, a precision spraying system was implemented to
assess its effectiveness in weed management. In twelve flax plots, a single
robotic spray pass reduced total weed populations (pigweed and Venice mallow)
by 24- to 42-fold compared to manual weeding in four flax plots, while also
causing less crop damage. Mobility experiments conducted on concrete, asphalt,
gravel, grass, and both wet and dry soil confirmed reliable traversal
consistent with torque sizing. The complete chassis can be constructed from
commodity T-slot extrusion with minimal machining, resulting in a bill of
materials costing approximately $5,000 - $6,000, which enables replication and
customization. The mentioned results demonstrate that low-cost, reconfigurable
over-the-row robots can achieve effective weed management with reduced crop
damage and labor requirements, while providing a versatile foundation for
phenotyping, sensing, and other agriculture applications. Design files and
implementation details are released to accelerate research and adoption of
modular agricultural robotics.

Abstract: Conventional linear crop layouts, optimised for tractors, hinder robotic
navigation with tight turns, long travel distances, and perceptual aliasing. We
propose a robot-centric square spiral layout with a central tramline, enabling
simpler motion and more efficient coverage. To exploit this geometry, we
develop a navigation stack combining DH-ResNet18 waypoint regression,
pixel-to-odometry mapping, A* planning, and model predictive control (MPC). In
simulations, the spiral layout yields up to 28% shorter paths and about 25%
faster execution for waypoint-based tasks across 500 waypoints than linear
layouts, while full-field coverage performance is comparable to an optimised
linear U-turn strategy. Multi-robot studies demonstrate efficient coordination
on the spirals rule-constrained graph, with a greedy allocator achieving 33-37%
lower batch completion times than a Hungarian assignment under our setup. These
results highlight the potential of redesigning field geometry to better suit
autonomous agriculture.

Conclusion: 这些策略能够从全局演示中学习鲁棒的分布式控制器，无需专家动作或机载测量。

Abstract: Learning control policies for multi-robot systems (MRS) remains a major
challenge due to long-term coordination and the difficulty of obtaining
realistic training data. In this work, we address both limitations within an
imitation learning framework. First, we shift the typical role of Curriculum
Learning in MRS, from scalability with the number of robots, to focus on
improving long-term coordination. We propose a curriculum strategy that
gradually increases the length of expert trajectories during training,
stabilizing learning and enhancing the accuracy of long-term behaviors. Second,
we introduce a method to approximate the egocentric perception of each robot
using only third-person global state demonstrations. Our approach transforms
idealized trajectories into locally available observations by filtering
neighbors, converting reference frames, and simulating onboard sensor
variability. Both contributions are integrated into a physics-informed
technique to produce scalable, distributed policies from observations. We
conduct experiments across two tasks with varying team sizes and noise levels.
Results show that our curriculum improves long-term accuracy, while our
perceptual estimation method yields policies that are robust to realistic
uncertainty. Together, these strategies enable the learning of robust,
distributed controllers from global demonstrations, even in the absence of
expert actions or onboard measurements.

Conclusion: 提出的规划器是首个无需传感器模型或噪声知识就能实现用户指定任务完成率的语义到达-避障任务规划器。

Abstract: This paper addresses semantic planning problems in unknown environments under
perceptual uncertainty. The environment contains multiple unknown semantically
labeled regions or objects, and the robot must reach desired locations while
maintaining class-dependent distances from them. We aim to compute robot paths
that complete such semantic reach-avoid tasks with user-defined probability
despite uncertain perception. Existing planning algorithms either ignore
perceptual uncertainty - thus lacking correctness guarantees - or assume known
sensor models and noise characteristics. In contrast, we present the first
planner for semantic reach-avoid tasks that achieves user-specified mission
completion rates without requiring any knowledge of sensor models or noise.
This is enabled by quantifying uncertainty in semantic maps - constructed
on-the-fly from perceptual measurements - using conformal prediction in a
model- and distribution-free manner. We validate our approach and the
theoretical mission completion rates through extensive experiments, showing
that it consistently outperforms baselines in mission success rates.

TL;DR: 该研究系统评估了局部对抗攻击，发现相比全局攻击，局部攻击具有更低的像素扰动和更高的图像质量指标，但计算成本更高且攻击成功率略有下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习的对抗攻击传统上关注全局扰动，但局部对抗噪声的潜力尚未充分探索。

Method: 通过引入二元掩码将噪声限制在特定区域，在FGSM、PGD和C&W等广泛使用的方法上系统评估局部对抗攻击。

Result: 局部攻击实现了显著更低的平均像素扰动、更高的PSNR和改进的SSIM，但计算努力增加且攻击成功率略有降低。迭代方法（PGD和C&W）比单步方法（FGSM）对局部化约束更稳健。

Conclusion: 这项工作提供了局部对抗攻击的全面分析，为推进攻击策略和设计鲁棒防御系统提供了实用见解。

Abstract: Adversarial attacks in machine learning traditionally focus on global
perturbations to input data, yet the potential of localized adversarial noise
remains underexplored. This study systematically evaluates localized
adversarial attacks across widely-used methods, including FGSM, PGD, and C&W,
to quantify their effectiveness, imperceptibility, and computational
efficiency. By introducing a binary mask to constrain noise to specific
regions, localized attacks achieve significantly lower mean pixel
perturbations, higher Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratios (PSNR), and improved
Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) compared to global attacks. However, these
benefits come at the cost of increased computational effort and a modest
reduction in Attack Success Rate (ASR). Our results highlight that iterative
methods, such as PGD and C&W, are more robust to localization constraints than
single-step methods like FGSM, maintaining higher ASR and imperceptibility
metrics. This work provides a comprehensive analysis of localized adversarial
attacks, offering practical insights for advancing attack strategies and
designing robust defensive systems.

*Liuwang Kang,Fan Wang,Shaoshan Liu,Hung-Chyun Chou,Chuan Lin,Ning Ding*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了上下文持续学习(ICCL)，通过任务调度和提示重排使大语言模型具备持续学习能力，研究发现ICCL受益于分布式练习，展现出类似人类的记忆保留模式，特别发现线性注意力模型具有更接近人类的保留模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大语言模型在连续多任务场景下是否能够实现长期记忆保留和跨任务知识积累，受人类记忆研究启发探索ICL在持续学习中的潜力。

Method: 提出上下文持续学习(ICCL)框架，通过任务调度和提示重排实现无需参数更新的持续学习，使用马尔可夫链基准测试，并提出人类保留相似性度量来评估模型与人类记忆模式的相似度。

Result: 实验表明ICCL受益于分布式练习，存在记忆保留的"甜蜜点"，线性注意力模型如MAMBA和RWKV展现出更接近人类的保留模式，尽管其保留性能低于基于Transformer的LLMs。

Conclusion: ICCL既具有认知合理性又具有实际有效性，提供了一种仅通过推理的持续学习范式，缓解了灾难性遗忘并解决了传统CL方法中的稳定性-可塑性困境。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can adapt to new tasks via in-context learning
(ICL) without parameter updates, making them powerful learning engines for fast
adaptation. While extensive research has examined ICL as a few-shot learner,
whether it can achieve long-term retention and cross-task knowledge
accumulation when multitasks arrive sequentially remains underexplored.
Motivated by human memory studies, we investigate the retention characteristics
of ICL in multitask settings and extend it to in-context continual learning
(ICCL), where continual learning ability emerges through task scheduling and
prompt rearrangement. Experiments on Markov-Chain benchmarks demonstrate that,
for specific large-language models, ICCL benefits from distributed practice
(DP) in a manner analogous to humans, consistently revealing a spacing "sweet
spot" for retention. Beyond retention performance, we propose a human-retention
similarity metric to quantify how closely a continual-learning (CL) method
aligns with human retention dynamics. Using this metric, we show that
linear-attention models such as MAMBA and RWKV exhibit particularly human-like
retention patterns, despite their retention performance lagging behind that of
Transformer-based LLMs. Overall, our results establish ICCL as both cognitively
plausible and practically effective, providing an inference-only CL paradigm
that mitigates catastrophic forgetting and addresses the stability-plasticity
dilemma in conventional CL methods.

TL;DR: 提出支持模型异构的通信高效分布式学习框架，通过融合层实现模块化组合，保持模型参数和架构的隐私性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决异构模型架构在协作学习中的互操作性和隐私保护挑战

Method: 采用通用融合层输出维度，将模型划分为个性化基础块和通用模块块，仅共享融合层输出

Result: 相比联邦学习和联邦分裂学习基线，实现了更优的通信效率，并在异构架构下保持稳定的训练性能

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了异构模型协作学习中的通信效率和隐私保护问题

Abstract: Collaborative learning across heterogeneous model architectures presents
significant challenges in ensuring interoperability and preserving privacy. We
propose a communication-efficient distributed learning framework that supports
model heterogeneity and enables modular composition during inference. To
facilitate interoperability, all clients adopt a common fusion-layer output
dimension, which permits each model to be partitioned into a personalized base
block and a generalized modular block. Clients share their fusion-layer
outputs, keeping model parameters and architectures private. Experimental
results demonstrate that the framework achieves superior communication
efficiency compared to federated learning (FL) and federated split learning
(FSL) baselines, while ensuring stable training performance across
heterogeneous architectures.

### [465] [On the Capacity of Self-Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22840)
*Micah Adler*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文分析了自注意力机制的关系恢复能力，提出了关系图识别(RGR)框架，推导出容量缩放定律：$D_K = \Theta(m' \log m' / d_{\text{model}})$ 对于恢复 $m'$ 个关系是必要且充分的，并为多头注意力提供了基于容量的理论依据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解自注意力机制在给定预算下能可靠恢复多少种不同关系的能力，缺乏对其容量的形式化理解。

Method: 引入关系图识别(RGR)框架，将键-查询通道表示为具有 $m'$ 条有向边的图，分析在给定上下文下恢复每个项目邻居的能力。通过信息论下界和显式构造证明容量缩放定律。

Result: 推导出 $D_K = \Theta(m' \log m' / d_{\text{model}})$ 的容量缩放定律，证明在压缩情况下($m > d_{\text{model}}$)将固定 $D_K$ 分配到多个小头可以减轻干扰，增加可恢复关系的数量。

Conclusion: 提供了自注意力容量的具体缩放定律，以及跨头分配键-查询预算的原则性设计规则，证实了多头注意力在缓解关系干扰方面的优势。

Abstract: While self-attention is known to learn relations among tokens, we lack a
formal understanding of its capacity: how many distinct relations can a single
layer reliably recover for a given budget?
  To formalize this, we introduce Relational Graph Recognition (RGR), where the
key-query channel represents a graph on $m$ items with $m'$ directed edges,
and, given a context of items, must recover the neighbors of each item. We
measure resources by the total key dimension $D_K = h\,d_k$. Within this
framework, we analytically derive a capacity scaling law and validate it
empirically. We show that $D_K = \Theta(m' \log m' / d_{\text{model}})$ is both
necessary (information-theoretic lower bound) and sufficient (explicit
construction) in a broad class of graphs to recover $m'$ relations. This
scaling law directly leads to a new, capacity-based rationale for multi-head
attention that applies even when each item only attends to a single target.
When embeddings are uncompressed ($m = d_{\text{model}}$) and the graph is a
permutation, a single head suffices. However, compression ($m >
d_{\text{model}}$) forces relations into overlapping subspaces, creating
interference that a single large head cannot disentangle. Our analysis shows
that allocating a fixed $D_K$ across many small heads mitigates this
interference, increasing the number of recoverable relations. Controlled
single-layer experiments mirror the theory, revealing a sharp performance
threshold that matches the predicted capacity scaling and confirms the benefit
of distributing $D_K$ across multiple heads.
  Altogether, these results provide a concrete scaling law for self-attention
capacity and a principled design rule for allocating key-query budget across
heads.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 表格数据的对抗鲁棒性研究相对较少，而现实世界决策系统广泛使用表格数据，需要评估其安全性。

Method: 使用无梯度方向估计和迭代边界搜索的组合方法，能够有效处理离散和连续特征空间，仅需少量查询即可找到对抗样本。

Result: 攻击成功率超过90%，几乎能攻破所有测试集样本，包括传统机器学习分类器和基于大语言模型的流水线，每实例仅需少量查询。

Conclusion: 表格模型对对抗扰动存在严重脆弱性，现实世界决策系统迫切需要更强的防御机制。

Abstract: Adversarial robustness in structured data remains an underexplored frontier
compared to vision and language domains. In this work, we introduce a novel
black-box, decision-based adversarial attack tailored for tabular data. Our
approach combines gradient-free direction estimation with an iterative boundary
search, enabling efficient navigation of discrete and continuous feature spaces
under minimal oracle access. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
successfully compromises nearly the entire test set across diverse models,
ranging from classical machine learning classifiers to large language model
(LLM)-based pipelines. Remarkably, the attack achieves success rates
consistently above 90%, while requiring only a small number of queries per
instance. These results highlight the critical vulnerability of tabular models
to adversarial perturbations, underscoring the urgent need for stronger
defenses in real-world decision-making systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了DPO-PoP方法，通过偏好对偏好的监督来推断自适应边界，在UltraFeedback数据集上优于vanilla DPO、固定边界DPO和真实边界DPO。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法使用无边界、固定边界或基于评分的简单边界，无法考虑不同偏好的强度差异，且依赖可能嘈杂的评分信息。建模偏好强度可以改善泛化能力和对齐效果。

Method: 提出DPO-PoP方法，扩展Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)，利用偏好对偏好的监督来推断每个数据点的自适应边界，无需准确偏好分数。

Result: 在UltraFeedback数据集上，DPO-PoP在判别和生成性能上均优于基准方法。发现判别和生成性能存在权衡关系。

Conclusion: 偏好对偏好的监督可以有效推断自适应边界，提升模型性能。针对判别和生成性能的权衡，提出了两种采样策略来收集偏好对偏好标签。

Abstract: Margin-based optimization is fundamental to improving generalization and
robustness in classification tasks. In the context of reward model learning
from preferences within Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF),
existing methods typically rely on no margins, fixed margins, or margins that
are simplistic functions of preference ratings. However, such formulations
often fail to account for the varying strengths of different preferences, for
example some preferences are associated with larger margins between responses,
or they rely on noisy margin information derived from ratings. We argue that
modeling the strength of preferences can lead to better generalization and more
faithful alignment. Furthermore, many existing methods that use adaptive
margins assume access to accurate preference scores, which can be difficult for
humans to provide reliably. We propose an approach that leverages preferences
over preferences, that is annotations indicating which of two preferences
reflects a stronger distinction. We use this ordinal signal to infer adaptive
margins on a per-datapoint basis. We introduce an extension to Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO), DPO-PoP, that incorporates adaptive margins from
preference-over-preference supervision, enabling improved discriminative and
generative performance. Empirically, our method outperforms vanilla DPO, DPO
with fixed margins, and DPO with ground-truth margins on the UltraFeedback
dataset. Additionally, we show that there is a tradeoff between discriminative
and generative performance: improving test classification accuracy,
particularly by correctly labeling weaker preferences at the expense of
stronger ones, can lead to a decline in generative quality. To navigate this
tradeoff, we propose two sampling strategies to gather
preference-over-preference labels: one favoring discriminative performance and
one favoring generative performance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个针对在线学习排序算法的对抗攻击框架，能够通过O(log T)次操纵使目标物品在T-o(T)轮中出现在前K推荐列表中，同时使学习算法产生线性遗憾。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管在线学习排序算法在信息检索和推荐系统中广泛应用，但它们对协同对抗攻击的脆弱性尚未被充分理解。

Method: 提出了两种攻击策略：针对CascadeUCB1的CascadeOFA和针对PBM-UCB的PBMOFA，通过精心设计的操纵来欺骗学习算法。

Result: 理论分析证明两种策略仅需O(log T)次操纵即可成功，并在真实世界数据上的实验验证了攻击效果。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了OLTR算法在对抗攻击下的安全漏洞，为开发更鲁棒的排序算法提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Online learning to rank (OLTR) plays a critical role in information retrieval
and machine learning systems, with a wide range of applications in search
engines and content recommenders. However, despite their extensive adoption,
the susceptibility of OLTR algorithms to coordinated adversarial attacks
remains poorly understood. In this work, we present a novel framework for
attacking some of the widely used OLTR algorithms. Our framework is designed to
promote a set of target items so that they appear in the list of top-K
recommendations for T - o(T) rounds, while simultaneously inducing linear
regret in the learning algorithm. We propose two novel attack strategies:
CascadeOFA for CascadeUCB1 and PBMOFA for PBM-UCB . We provide theoretical
guarantees showing that both strategies require only O(log T) manipulations to
succeed. Additionally, we supplement our theoretical analysis with empirical
results on real-world data.

TL;DR: 该论文通过神经正切核工具分析了图神经网络中邻域采样的理论行为，发现不同采样方法在有限样本下产生不同的后验高斯过程，但随着样本增加会收敛到相同结果，且没有一种采样方法在所有情况下都占优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 邻域采样是训练大规模图神经网络的重要技术，能控制内存和时间成本，但其系统性行为缺乏理论理解。

Method: 使用神经正切核工具分析不同邻域采样方法对应的后验高斯过程，研究有限样本下的训练动态。

Result: 不同采样方法在有限样本下产生不同的后验分布，但随样本增加会收敛；后验协方差无法比较，说明没有采样方法在所有情况下都最优。

Conclusion: 邻域采样的理论分析揭示了其系统性行为，解释了为什么实践中没有一种采样方法能始终优于其他方法。

Abstract: Neighborhood sampling is an important ingredient in the training of
large-scale graph neural networks. It suppresses the exponential growth of the
neighborhood size across network layers and maintains feasible memory
consumption and time costs. While it becomes a standard implementation in
practice, its systemic behaviors are less understood. We conduct a theoretical
analysis by using the tool of neural tangent kernels, which characterize the
(analogous) training dynamics of neural networks based on their infinitely wide
counterparts -- Gaussian processes (GPs). We study several established
neighborhood sampling approaches and the corresponding posterior GP. With
limited samples, the posteriors are all different, although they converge to
the same one as the sample size increases. Moreover, the posterior covariance,
which lower-bounds the mean squared prediction error, is uncomparable, aligning
with observations that no sampling approach dominates.

Motivation: 工业工厂和能源生产商中非计划停机的成本高昂且难以维护，现有声学异常检测研究主要依赖通用工业或合成数据集，针对水电站的研究较少。

Method: 在强噪声条件下进行声学预处理，提取时域和频域特征，然后对三种机器学习模型（LSTM AE、K-Means和OC-SVM）进行基准测试，使用奥地利Rodundwerk II抽水蓄能电站的两个真实数据集。

Result: One-Class SVM在准确性（ROC AUC 0.966-0.998）和最小训练时间方面达到最佳平衡，而LSTM自编码器提供了强大的检测能力（ROC AUC 0.889-0.997），但计算成本较高。

Conclusion: OC-SVM是水电站声学异常检测的有效方法，在准确性和效率方面表现最佳，适用于实际工业应用。

Abstract: In the context of industrial factories and energy producers, unplanned
outages are highly costly and difficult to service. However, existing
acoustic-anomaly detection studies largely rely on generic industrial or
synthetic datasets, with few focused on hydropower plants due to limited
access. This paper presents a comparative analysis of acoustic-based anomaly
detection methods, as a way to improve predictive maintenance in hydropower
plants. We address key challenges in the acoustic preprocessing under highly
noisy conditions before extracting time- and frequency-domain features. Then,
we benchmark three machine learning models: LSTM AE, K-Means, and OC-SVM, which
are tested on two real-world datasets from the Rodundwerk II pumped-storage
plant in Austria, one with induced anomalies and one with real-world
conditions. The One-Class SVM achieved the best trade-off of accuracy (ROC AUC
0.966-0.998) and minimal training time, while the LSTM autoencoder delivered
strong detection (ROC AUC 0.889-0.997) at the expense of higher computational
cost.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准Conformal Prediction在不确定性量化中不考虑敏感属性，需要将公平性纳入CP框架，确保不同子组的条件覆盖保证。

Method: 扩展Conformal Fairness框架到联邦学习环境，利用可交换性假设，分析不同人口群体的公平性差距来审计模型公平性。

Result: 在多个领域的数据集上进行实验，验证了所提出框架的有效性。

Conclusion: 成功将公平性保证扩展到联邦学习场景，为联邦模型提供了公平性审计的有效方法。

Abstract: Conformal Prediction (CP) is a widely used technique for quantifying
uncertainty in machine learning models. In its standard form, CP offers
probabilistic guarantees on the coverage of the true label, but it is agnostic
to sensitive attributes in the dataset. Several recent works have sought to
incorporate fairness into CP by ensuring conditional coverage guarantees across
different subgroups. One such method is Conformal Fairness (CF). In this work,
we extend the CF framework to the Federated Learning setting and discuss how we
can audit a federated model for fairness by analyzing the fairness-related gaps
for different demographic groups. We empirically validate our framework by
conducting experiments on several datasets spanning multiple domains, fully
leveraging the exchangeability assumption.

Abstract: Manifold alignment (MA) involves a set of techniques for learning shared
representations across domains, yet many traditional MA methods are incapable
of performing out-of-sample extension, limiting their real-world applicability.
We propose a guided representation learning framework leveraging a
geometry-regularized twin autoencoder (AE) architecture to enhance MA while
enabling generalization to unseen data. Our method enforces structured
cross-modal mappings to maintain geometric fidelity in learned embeddings. By
incorporating a pre-trained alignment model and a multitask learning
formulation, we improve cross-domain generalization and representation
robustness while maintaining alignment fidelity. We evaluate our approach using
several MA methods, showing improvements in embedding consistency, information
preservation, and cross-domain transfer. Additionally, we apply our framework
to Alzheimer's disease diagnosis, demonstrating its ability to integrate
multi-modal patient data and enhance predictive accuracy in cases limited to a
single domain by leveraging insights from the multi-modal problem.

Conclusion: 该框架为资源受限环境下的奖励感知蒸馏提供了理论基础和实际高效的解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce a novel approach to large language model (LLM) distillation by
formulating it as a constrained reinforcement learning problem. While recent
work has begun exploring the integration of task-specific rewards into
distillation processes, existing methods typically rely on ad-hoc reward
weighting. We propose a principled optimization framework that maximizes
task-specific rewards while constraining the divergence from the teacher model
to remain below a specified threshold. Our approach adapts constrained state
augmented reinforcement learning to the distillation setting, introducing a
modified reward function that maintains theoretical guarantees of constraint
satisfaction without requiring state augmentation or teacher model access
during deployment and without the computational overhead of the dual Lagrangian
methods. Through extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning tasks, we
demonstrate that our method achieves better constraint satisfaction rates and
better reasoning compared to the soft Lagrangian relaxation baselines while
maintaining competitive task performance. Our framework provides a
theoretically grounded and practically efficient solution for reward-aware
distillation in resource-constrained settings.

TL;DR: MonoCon是一个通过功能约束学习高质量、鲁棒、高效且解耦表示的框架，使用单调多层感知机头连接到预训练编码器，在保持性能的同时实现9倍压缩和1.5倍鲁棒性提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 学习高质量、鲁棒、高效且解耦的表示是AI的核心挑战，传统方法主要依赖架构和优化约束，本文引入功能约束作为第三种方法。

Method: 在预训练编码器上附加小型单调MLP头，通过对比损失和单调性约束引导编码器与头的协同适应，学习紧凑解耦表示。

Result: 在CIFAR-100上实现9倍压缩和1.5倍鲁棒性提升，保持99%的5-NN分类准确率；在SNLI上实现3.4倍压缩和1.4倍鲁棒性提升，STSb分数仅轻微下降。

Conclusion: MonoCon通过功能约束学习到的鲁棒超紧凑表示为边缘计算到云规模检索等不同场景提供了统一解决方案，是一个通用领域无关框架。

Abstract: Learning high-quality, robust, efficient, and disentangled representations is
a central challenge in artificial intelligence (AI). Deep metric learning
frameworks tackle this challenge primarily using architectural and optimization
constraints. Here, we introduce a third approach that instead relies on
$\textit{functional}$ constraints. Specifically, we present MonoCon, a simple
framework that uses a small monotonic multi-layer perceptron (MLP) head
attached to any pre-trained encoder. Due to co-adaptation between encoder and
head guided by contrastive loss and monotonicity constraints, MonoCon learns
robust, disentangled, and highly compact embeddings at a practically negligible
performance cost. On the CIFAR-100 image classification task, MonoCon yields
representations that are nearly 9x more compact and 1.5x more robust than the
fine-tuned encoder baseline, while retaining 99\% of the baseline's 5-NN
classification accuracy. We also report a 3.4x more compact and 1.4x more
robust representation on an SNLI sentence similarity task for a marginal
reduction in the STSb score, establishing MonoCon as a general domain-agnostic
framework. Crucially, these robust, ultra-compact representations learned via
functional constraints offer a unified solution to critical challenges in
disparate contexts ranging from edge computing to cloud-scale retrieval.

TL;DR: 本文研究了量化感知训练(QAT)中FP阶段和QAT阶段计算资源分配的最优比例，发现QAT与FP训练的最优比例随总计算量增加而增加，并提出了基于tokens-per-parameter-byte统计量的预测方法和损失缩放定律。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究表明将训练分解为全精度(FP)阶段和QAT阶段比单独使用QAT能获得更好的精度，但两个阶段之间计算资源的最优分配仍不明确。

Method: 在不同计算预算、QAT位宽和模型规模下进行广泛实验，分析不同QAT持续时间对最终性能的影响，并推导损失缩放定律来预测最优QAT比例和最终模型性能。

Result: 实验表明QAT与FP训练的最优比例随总计算量增加而增加，该比例可通过tokens-per-parameter-byte统计量准确预测，并提出了冷却和QAT融合方法节省计算资源。

Conclusion: 研究结果为高效QAT规划提供了实用见解，能够在相同计算预算下训练更高质量的量化模型。

Abstract: Quantization-aware training (QAT) is a leading technique for improving the
accuracy of quantized neural networks. Previous work has shown that decomposing
training into a full-precision (FP) phase followed by a QAT phase yields
superior accuracy compared to QAT alone. However, the optimal allocation of
compute between the FP and QAT phases remains unclear. We conduct extensive
experiments with various compute budgets, QAT bit widths, and model sizes from
86.0M to 2.2B to investigate how different QAT durations impact final
performance. We demonstrate that, contrary to previous findings, the
loss-optimal ratio of QAT to FP training increases with the total amount of
compute. Moreover, the optimal fraction can be accurately predicted for a wide
range of model sizes and quantization widths using the
tokens-per-parameter-byte statistic. From experimental data, we derive a loss
scaling law that predicts both optimal QAT ratios and final model performance
across different QAT/FP compute allocation strategies and QAT bit widths. We
use the scaling law to make further predictions, which we verify
experimentally, including which QAT bit width is optimal under a given memory
constraint and how QAT accuracy with different bit widths compares to
full-precision model accuracy. Additionally, we propose a novel cooldown and
QAT fusion approach that performs learning rate decay jointly with
quantization-aware training, eliminating redundant full-precision model updates
and achieving significant compute savings. These findings provide practical
insights into efficient QAT planning and enable the training of higher-quality
quantized models with the same compute budget.

TL;DR: SOAP优化算法在语言建模任务中表现出色，但理论分析表明它与Shampoo在理想条件下等价，实验验证两者收敛速度和最终损失无显著差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从梯度白化角度分析Adam、Shampoo和SOAP优化算法，理解其预条件器作为白化矩阵近似的性质，并建立SOAP与Shampoo在理论上的等价关系。

Method: 通过理论分析建立SOAP与Shampoo在Kronecker乘积假设下的等价性，并使用nanoGPT进行语言建模实验和灰度图像着色实验进行实证验证。

Result: 实验结果显示SOAP与Shampoo具有相似的收敛速度，在最终损失方面与Adam和Shampoo相比没有显著优势，这与理论等价性一致。

Conclusion: SOAP虽然在语言建模中表现良好，但与Shampoo在理论上是等价的，实际性能无显著差异，这为理解优化算法提供了新的理论视角。

Abstract: Shampoo with Adam in the Preconditioner's eigenbasis (SOAP) has recently
emerged as a promising optimization algorithm for neural network training,
achieving superior training efficiency over both Adam and Shampoo in language
modeling tasks. In this work, we analyze Adam, Shampoo, and SOAP from the
perspective of gradient whitening, interpreting their preconditioners as
approximations to the whitening matrix, which captures second-order curvature
information. We further establish a theoretical equivalence between idealized
versions of SOAP and Shampoo under the Kronecker product assumption. To
empirically evaluate these insights, we reproduce the language modeling
experiments using nanoGPT and grayscale image colorization. Our results show
that SOAP exhibits similar convergence rate as Shampoo, and no significant
advantage over both Adam and Shampoo in the final loss achieved, which aligns
with their equivalence in theory.

deploying large language models at low precision. Still, current methods show
perplexity degradation at bit-widths less than or equal to 4, partly because
representing outliers causes precision issues in parameters that share the same
scales as these outliers. This problem is especially pronounced for
calibration-free, uniform quantization methods. We introduce SINQ to augment
existing post-training quantizers with an additional second-axis scale factor
and a fast Sinkhorn-Knopp-style algorithm that finds scales to normalize
per-row and per-column variances, thereby minimizing a novel per-matrix proxy
target for quantization: the matrix imbalance. Our method has no interactions
between layers and can be trivially applied to new architectures to quantize
any linear layers. We evaluate our method on the Qwen3 model family and
DeepSeek-V2.5. SINQ improves WikiText2 and C4 perplexity significantly against
uncalibrated uniform quantization baselines and can be further enhanced by
combining it with calibration and non-uniform quantization levels. Code to
reproduce the results of this work and to easily quantize models using SINQ is
available at https://github.com/huawei-csl/SINQ.

TL;DR: 提出基于傅里叶神经算子的元学习框架，用于近似数据同化问题中的逆Hessian算子，显著提升共轭梯度法的收敛效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 变分数据同化方法在海洋和大气预报中应用广泛，但涉及Hessian信息时计算成本高昂，需要更高效的求解方法。

Method: 使用傅里叶神经算子(FNO)学习数据同化问题族中的逆Hessian算子，为共轭梯度法提供有效初始化。

Result: 在线性平流方程上的实验表明，FNO-CG方法相比标准CG平均相对误差降低62%，迭代次数减少17%，在病态条件下改进最显著。

Conclusion: FNO-CG方法对具有挑战性的数据同化问题展现出鲁棒性和高效性，特别适用于病态场景。

Abstract: Data assimilation (DA) is crucial for enhancing solutions to partial
differential equations (PDEs), such as those in numerical weather prediction,
by optimizing initial conditions using observational data. Variational DA
methods are widely used in oceanic and atmospheric forecasting, but become
computationally expensive, especially when Hessian information is involved. To
address this challenge, we propose a meta-learning framework that employs the
Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) to approximate the inverse Hessian operator
across a family of DA problems, thereby providing an effective initialization
for the conjugate gradient (CG) method. Numerical experiments on a linear
advection equation demonstrate that the resulting FNO-CG approach reduces the
average relative error by $62\%$ and the number of iterations by $17\%$
compared to the standard CG. These improvements are most pronounced in
ill-conditioned scenarios, highlighting the robustness and efficiency of FNO-CG
for challenging DA problems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度生成模型在估计潜在结果分布时缺乏Neyman正交性这一重要理论性质，无法实现准预言机效率和双重稳健性。

Method: 开发了基于条件归一化流(GDR-CNFs)、条件生成对抗网络(GDR-CGANs)、条件变分自编码器(GDR-CVAEs)和条件扩散模型(GDR-CDMs)的GDR-learners框架。

Conclusion: GDR-learners为因果推断中的潜在结果分布估计提供了理论保证优越且实际效果出色的解决方案。

Abstract: Various deep generative models have been proposed to estimate potential
outcomes distributions from observational data. However, none of them have the
favorable theoretical property of general Neyman-orthogonality and, associated
with it, quasi-oracle efficiency and double robustness. In this paper, we
introduce a general suite of generative Neyman-orthogonal (doubly-robust)
learners that estimate the conditional distributions of potential outcomes. Our
proposed GDR-learners are flexible and can be instantiated with many
state-of-the-art deep generative models. In particular, we develop GDR-learners
based on (a) conditional normalizing flows (which we call GDR-CNFs), (b)
conditional generative adversarial networks (GDR-CGANs), (c) conditional
variational autoencoders (GDR-CVAEs), and (d) conditional diffusion models
(GDR-CDMs). Unlike the existing methods, our GDR-learners possess the
properties of quasi-oracle efficiency and rate double robustness, and are thus
asymptotically optimal. In a series of (semi-)synthetic experiments, we
demonstrate that our GDR-learners are very effective and outperform the
existing methods in estimating the conditional distributions of potential
outcomes.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: As Generative AI (GenAI) systems see growing adoption, a key concern involves
the external validity of evaluations, or the extent to which they generalize
from lab-based to real-world deployment conditions. Threats to the external
validity of GenAI evaluations arise when the source sample of human raters and
system outputs used to obtain a system quality estimate differs from the target
distribution at deployment time. In this work, we propose a doubly-robust
estimation framework designed to address this evaluation sampling bias. Key to
our approach is the use of "persona" ratings produced by prompting an LLM
evaluator (i.e., an LLM-as-a-judge) to behave as a human rater with specific
sociodemographic characteristics. Our doubly-robust framework combines these
informative yet imperfect persona ratings with human ratings obtained under
evaluation sampling bias to produce statistically valid system quality
estimates. In particular, we show that our approach yields valid system quality
estimates when either (i) a model trained to predict human ratings using
persona ratings and source data observed under sampling bias, or (ii) a
reweighting model that corrects for sampling bias is of sufficient quality. We
validate our framework theoretically and via a novel Persona Simulation
Framework (PSF) designed to systematically manipulate persona quality and the
degree of evaluation sampling bias present in source data. Our work provides a
principled foundation for combining imperfect persona ratings with human
ratings observed under sampling bias to obtain valid system quality estimates.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) struggles to scale to large, combinatorial action
spaces common in many real-world problems. This paper introduces a novel
framework for training discrete diffusion models as highly effective policies
in these complex settings. Our key innovation is an efficient online training
process that ensures stable and effective policy improvement. By leveraging
policy mirror descent (PMD) to define an ideal, regularized target policy
distribution, we frame the policy update as a distributional matching problem,
training the expressive diffusion model to replicate this stable target. This
decoupled approach stabilizes learning and significantly enhances training
performance. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results and superior sample
efficiency across a diverse set of challenging combinatorial benchmarks,
including DNA sequence generation, RL with macro-actions, and multi-agent
systems. Experiments demonstrate that our diffusion policies attain superior
performance compared to other baselines.

Conclusion: 这是第一个可证明收敛的离策略目标驱动AC算法，解决了致命三元组设置下的演员-评论家学习挑战。

Abstract: Off-policy reinforcement learning (RL) with function approximation offers an
effective way to improve sample efficiency by reusing past experience. Within
this setting, the actor-critic (AC) framework has achieved strong empirical
success. However, both the critic and actor learning is challenging for the
off-policy AC methods: first of all, in addition to the classic "deadly triad"
instability of off-policy evaluation, it also suffers from a "moving target"
problem, where the policy being evaluated changes continually; secondly, actor
learning becomes less efficient due to the difficulty of estimating the exact
off-policy policy gradient. The first challenge essentially reduces the problem
to repeatedly performing off-policy evaluation for changing policies. For the
second challenge, the off-policy policy gradient theorem requires a complex and
often impractical algorithm to estimate an additional emphasis critic, which is
typically neglected in practice, thereby reducing to the on-policy policy
gradient as an approximation. In this work, we introduce a novel concept of
functional critic modeling, which leads to a new AC framework that addresses
both challenges for actor-critic learning under the deadly triad setting. We
provide a theoretical analysis in the linear function setting, establishing the
provable convergence of our framework, which, to the best of our knowledge, is
the first convergent off-policy target-based AC algorithm. From a practical
perspective, we further propose a carefully designed neural network
architecture for the functional critic modeling and demonstrate its
effectiveness through preliminary experiments on widely used RL tasks from the
DeepMind Control Benchmark.

Motivation: 现有的功能数据聚类方法往往难以处理多维功能数据中复杂的非线性依赖关系，且对函数相位变化敏感，需要开发能够捕获复杂非线性关系并抵抗相位变化的鲁棒聚类框架。

Conclusion: FAEclust框架成功解决了多维功能数据聚类中的非线性依赖和相位变化问题，为功能数据分析提供了有效的聚类工具。

Abstract: We introduce FAEclust, a novel functional autoencoder framework for cluster
analysis of multi-dimensional functional data, data that are random
realizations of vector-valued random functions. Our framework features a
universal-approximator encoder that captures complex nonlinear
interdependencies among component functions, and a universal-approximator
decoder capable of accurately reconstructing both Euclidean and manifold-valued
functional data. Stability and robustness are enhanced through innovative
regularization strategies applied to functional weights and biases.
Additionally, we incorporate a clustering loss into the network's training
objective, promoting the learning of latent representations that are conducive
to effective clustering. A key innovation is our shape-informed clustering
objective, ensuring that the clustering results are resistant to phase
variations in the functions. We establish the universal approximation property
of our non-linear decoder and validate the effectiveness of our model through
extensive experiments.

Abstract: Mathematical programming -- the task of expressing operations and
decision-making problems in precise mathematical language -- is fundamental
across domains, yet remains a skill-intensive process requiring operations
research expertise. Recent advances in large language models for complex
reasoning have spurred interest in automating this task, translating natural
language into executable optimization models. Current approaches, however,
achieve limited accuracy, hindered by scarce and noisy training data without
leveraging domain knowledge. In this work, we systematically integrate
optimization expertise to improve formulation accuracy for mixed-integer linear
programming, a key family of mathematical programs. Our approach first cleans
training data through class-based error analysis to explicitly prevent common
mistakes within each optimization class. We then develop multi-turn inference
strategies that guide LLMs with class-specific error summaries and solver
feedback, enabling iterative refinement. Experiments across multiple base LLMs
demonstrate that combining cleaned data with domain-informed prompting and
feedback improves formulation accuracy by 14 percentage points on average,
enabling further progress toward robust LLM-assisted optimization formulation.

Abstract: As machine learning models continue to grow in size and complexity, efficient
serving faces increasingly broad trade-offs spanning accuracy, latency,
resource usage, and other objectives. Multi-model serving further complicates
these trade-offs; for example, in cascaded models, each early-exit decision
balances latency reduction against potential accuracy loss. Despite the
pervasiveness and importance of such trade-offs, current strategies remain
largely heuristic and case-specific, limiting both their theoretical guarantees
and general applicability.
  We present a general framework, T-Tamer, which formalizes this setting as a
multi-stage decision process, where the objective is to determine both when to
exit and which model to consult. Our main result shows that recall (i.e., the
ability to revisit earlier models) is both necessary and sufficient for
achieving provable performance guarantees. In particular, we prove that
strategies without recall cannot obtain any constant-factor approximation to
the optimal trade-off, whereas recall-based strategies provably attain the
optimal trade-off in polynomial time.
  We validate our analysis through experiments on synthetic datasets and
early-exit workloads for vision and NLP benchmarks. The results show that
recall-based strategies consistently yield efficient accuracy-latency
trade-offs. We hope this work provides a principled foundation for bridging
heuristic practice with theoretical guarantees in the design of early-exit and
cascaded models.

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a promising approach for
interpreting neural network representations by learning sparse,
human-interpretable features from dense activations. We investigate whether
incorporating variational methods into SAE architectures can improve feature
organization and interpretability. We introduce the variational Sparse
Autoencoder (vSAE), which replaces deterministic ReLU gating with stochastic
sampling from learned Gaussian posteriors and incorporates KL divergence
regularization toward a standard normal prior. Our hypothesis is that this
probabilistic sampling creates dispersive pressure, causing features to
organize more coherently in the latent space while avoiding overlap. We
evaluate a Topk vSAE against a standard TopK SAE on Pythia-70M transformer
residual steam activations using comprehensive benchmarks including SAE Bench,
individual feature interpretability analysis, and global latent space
visualization through t-SNE. The vSAE underperforms standard SAE across core
evaluation metrics, though excels at feature independence and ablation metrics.
The KL divergence term creates excessive regularization pressure that
substantially reduces the fraction of living features, leading to observed
performance degradation. While vSAE features demonstrate improved robustness,
they exhibit many more dead features than baseline. Our findings suggest that
naive application of variational methods to SAEs does not improve feature
organization or interpretability.

Abstract: Calibrating a multiclass predictor, that outputs a distribution over labels,
is particularly challenging due to the exponential number of possible
prediction values. In this work, we propose a new definition of calibration
error that interpolates between two established calibration error notions, one
with known exponential sample complexity and one with polynomial sample
complexity for calibrating a given predictor. Our algorithm can calibrate any
given predictor for the entire range of interpolation, except for one endpoint,
using only a polynomial number of samples. At the other endpoint, we achieve
nearly optimal dependence on the error parameter, improving upon previous work.
A key technical contribution is a novel application of adaptive data analysis
with high adaptivity but only logarithmic overhead in the sample complexity.

Abstract: From metronomes to celestial bodies, mechanics underpins how the world
evolves in time and space. With consideration of this, a number of recent
neural network models leverage inductive biases from classical mechanics to
encourage model interpretability and ensure forecasted states are physical.
However, in general, these models are designed to capture the dynamics of a
single system with fixed physical parameters, from state-space measurements of
a known configuration space. In this paper we introduce Symplectic Phase Space
GAN (SPS-GAN) which can capture the dynamics of multiple systems, and
generalize to unseen physical parameters from. Moreover, SPS-GAN does not
require prior knowledge of the system configuration space. In fact, SPS-GAN can
discover the configuration space structure of the system from arbitrary
measurement types (e.g., state-space measurements, video frames). To achieve
physically plausible generation, we introduce a novel architecture which embeds
a Hamiltonian neural network recurrent module in a conditional GAN backbone. To
discover the structure of the configuration space, we optimize the conditional
time-series GAN objective with an additional physically motivated term to
encourages a sparse representation of the configuration space. We demonstrate
the utility of SPS-GAN for trajectory prediction, video generation and symmetry
discovery. Our approach captures multiple systems and achieves performance on
par with supervised models designed for single systems.

Motivation: 当前稀疏混合专家模型通常针对固定稀疏度级别训练，需要维护多个模型来满足不同效率目标，这增加了训练、维护成本并限制了部署灵活性。

Method: PHDS通过跨稀疏度级别的混合训练和在高稀疏度下的短课程学习，无需架构更改，将单个检查点转换为全局稀疏度控制面。

Conclusion: PHDS使全局稀疏度成为一等服务的原语，通过单个模型实现了可预测的精度/延迟权衡，简化了MoE的灵活部署。

Abstract: Sparse Mixtures of Experts (MoEs) are typically trained to operate at a fixed
sparsity level, e.g. $k$ in a top-$k$ gating function. This global sparsity
level determines an operating point on the accuracy/latency curve; currently,
meeting multiple efficiency targets means training and maintaining multiple
models. This practice complicates serving, increases training and maintenance
costs, and limits flexibility in meeting diverse latency, efficiency, and
energy requirements. We show that pretrained MoEs are more robust to runtime
sparsity shifts than commonly assumed, and introduce MoE-PHDS ({\bf P}ost {\bf
H}oc {\bf D}eclared {\bf S}parsity), a lightweight SFT method that turns a
single checkpoint into a global sparsity control surface. PHDS mixes training
across sparsity levels and anchors with a short curriculum at high sparsity,
requiring no architectural changes. The result is predictable accuracy/latency
tradeoffs from one model: practitioners can ``dial $k$'' at inference time
without swapping checkpoints, changing architecture, or relying on token-level
heuristics. Experiments on OLMoE-1B-7B-0125, Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B, and proprietary
models fit on multiple operating points show that PHDS matches or exceeds
well-specified oracle models, improves cross-sparsity agreement by up to 22\%
vs. well-specified oracle models, and enables simplified, flexible runtime MoE
deployment by making global sparsity a first-class serving primitive.

Abstract: Recent work in Topological Deep Learning (TDL) seeks to generalize graph
learning's preeminent $message \ passing$ paradigm to more complex relational
structures: simplicial complexes, cell complexes, hypergraphs, and combinations
thereof. Many approaches to such ${higher\text{-}order \ message \ passing}$
(HOMP) admit formulation in terms of nonlinear diffusion with the Hodge
(combinatorial) Laplacian, a graded operator which carries an inductive bias
that dimension-$k$ data features correlate with dimension-$k$ topological
features encoded in the (singular) cohomology of the underlying domain. For
$k=0$ this recovers the graph Laplacian and its well-studied homophily bias. In
higher gradings, however, the Hodge Laplacian's bias is more opaque and
potentially even degenerate. In this essay, we position sheaf theory as a
natural and principled formalism for modifying the Hodge Laplacian's
diffusion-mediated interface between local and global descriptors toward more
expressive message passing. The sheaf Laplacian's inductive bias correlates
dimension-$k$ data features with dimension-$k$ $sheaf$ cohomology, a data-aware
generalization of singular cohomology. We will contextualize and novelly extend
prior theory on sheaf diffusion in graph learning ($k=0$) in such a light --
and explore how it fails to generalize to $k>0$ -- before developing novel
theory and practice for the higher-order setting. Our exposition is accompanied
by a self-contained introduction shepherding sheaves from the abstract to the

*Melody Zixuan Li,Kumar Krishna Agrawal,Arna Ghosh,Komal Kumar Teru,Adam Santoro,Guillaume Lajoie,Blake A. Richards*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文通过谱分析研究大语言模型训练过程中的几何演化，发现预训练呈现三个非单调阶段：初始表示坍缩、熵寻求（维度扩展）和压缩寻求（各向异性整合），这些阶段与下游性能提升相关。后训练方法进一步改变几何特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准训练指标无法解释大语言模型复杂能力的涌现，需要从表示几何的角度研究训练动态。

Method: 使用谱分析方法，测量有效秩（RankMe）和特征谱衰减（α-ReQ），分析OLMo和Pythia模型在预训练和后训练过程中的表示几何变化。

Result: 发现预训练存在三个几何阶段：初始坍缩、熵寻求（维度扩展伴随n-gram记忆峰值）和压缩寻求（各向异性整合与下游性能显著提升）。后训练中SFT/DPO驱动熵寻求，RLVR驱动压缩寻求。

Conclusion: 模型训练几何演化源于交叉熵优化与表示瓶颈的相互作用，不同后训练方法通过调节几何特性影响模型性能。

Abstract: Standard training metrics like loss fail to explain the emergence of complex
capabilities in large language models. We take a spectral approach to
investigate the geometry of learned representations across pretraining and
post-training, measuring effective rank (RankMe) and eigenspectrum decay
($\alpha$-ReQ). With OLMo (1B-7B) and Pythia (160M-12B) models, we uncover a
consistent non-monotonic sequence of three geometric phases during
autoregressive pretraining. The initial "warmup" phase exhibits rapid
representational collapse. This is followed by an "entropy-seeking" phase,
where the manifold's dimensionality expands substantially, coinciding with peak
n-gram memorization. Subsequently, a "compression-seeking" phase imposes
anisotropic consolidation, selectively preserving variance along dominant
eigendirections while contracting others, a transition marked with significant
improvement in downstream task performance. We show these phases can emerge
from a fundamental interplay of cross-entropy optimization under skewed token
frequencies and representational bottlenecks ($d \ll |V|$). Post-training
further transforms geometry: SFT and DPO drive "entropy-seeking" dynamics to
integrate specific instructional or preferential data, improving
in-distribution performance while degrading out-of-distribution robustness.
Conversely, RLVR induces "compression-seeking", enhancing reward alignment but
reducing generation diversity.

TL;DR: 本文从潜在表示学习角度分析灾难性干扰问题，提出将其建模为识别问题的理论框架，并通过识别共享潜在变量来最小化遗忘现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 灾难性干扰（灾难性遗忘）是机器学习中的基本挑战，模型在学习新任务时会逐渐丧失对先前任务的性能。本文旨在从潜在表示学习的角度更好地理解和建模这一问题。

Method: 提出两阶段训练方法：首先使用最大似然估计从部分任务感知和全任务感知配置中学习潜在表示，然后优化KL散度来识别和学习共享潜在变量。

Result: 理论和实证验证表明，识别和学习共享表示可以有效缓解机器学习系统中的灾难性干扰问题。

Conclusion: 通过识别共享潜在变量来最小化遗忘距离的方法，为缓解灾难性干扰提供了理论保证和实际性能提升。

Abstract: Catastrophic interference, also known as catastrophic forgetting, is a
fundamental challenge in machine learning, where a trained learning model
progressively loses performance on previously learned tasks when adapting to
new ones. In this paper, we aim to better understand and model the catastrophic
interference problem from a latent representation learning point of view, and
propose a novel theoretical framework that formulates catastrophic interference
as an identification problem. Our analysis demonstrates that the forgetting
phenomenon can be quantified by the distance between partial-task aware (PTA)
and all-task aware (ATA) setups. Building upon recent advances in
identifiability theory, we prove that this distance can be minimized through
identification of shared latent variables between these setups. When learning,
we propose our method \ourmeos with two-stage training strategy: First, we
employ maximum likelihood estimation to learn the latent representations from
both PTA and ATA configurations. Subsequently, we optimize the KL divergence to
identify and learn the shared latent variables. Through theoretical guarantee
and empirical validations, we establish that identifying and learning these
shared representations can effectively mitigate catastrophic interference in
machine learning systems. Our approach provides both theoretical guarantees and
practical performance improvements across both synthetic and benchmark
datasets.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合个性化差分隐私和自适应模型设计的联邦学习框架，保护训练数据隐私的同时提升模型性能，在CIFAR-10和CIFAR-100数据集上相比现有方法准确率提升6.82%，模型大小和通信成本大幅降低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 6G网络需要边缘智能，联邦学习是实现这一目标的关键范式，但边缘数据的敏感性和异构性带来两大挑战：参数共享存在数据重构风险，统一全局模型难以适应不同的本地数据分布。

Method: 使用样本级表示进行知识共享，应用个性化差分隐私策略抵抗重构攻击；开发隐私感知的神经架构搜索算法，生成本地定制的架构和超参数。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和CIFAR-100数据集上，相比PerFedRLNAS方法准确率提升6.82%，模型大小减少到1/10，通信成本降低到1/20。

Conclusion: 这是首个为基于表示的联邦学习量身定制的个性化差分隐私解决方案，具有理论收敛保证，在保证训练数据隐私的同时显著优于现有方法的模型性能。

Abstract: The Sixth-Generation (6G) network envisions pervasive artificial intelligence
(AI) as a core goal, enabled by edge intelligence through on-device data
utilization. To realize this vision, federated learning (FL) has emerged as a
key paradigm for collaborative training across edge devices. However, the
sensitivity and heterogeneity of edge data pose key challenges to FL: parameter
sharing risks data reconstruction, and a unified global model struggles to
adapt to diverse local distributions. In this paper, we propose a novel
federated learning framework that integrates personalized differential privacy
(DP) and adaptive model design. To protect training data, we leverage
sample-level representations for knowledge sharing and apply a personalized DP
strategy to resist reconstruction attacks. To ensure distribution-aware
adaptation under privacy constraints, we develop a privacy-aware neural
architecture search (NAS) algorithm that generates locally customized
architectures and hyperparameters. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first personalized DP solution tailored for representation-based FL with
theoretical convergence guarantees. Our scheme achieves strong privacy
guarantees for training data while significantly outperforming state-of-the-art
methods in model performance. Experiments on benchmark datasets such as
CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 demonstrate that our scheme improves accuracy by 6.82\%
over the federated NAS method PerFedRLNAS, while reducing model size to 1/10
and communication cost to 1/20.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GuardNet是一个分层过滤框架，通过构建结构化图结合图神经网络来检测和过滤越狱提示，显著提升了LLM的安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型容易受到越狱攻击，这些对抗性提示会绕过对齐约束，导致未经授权或有害行为，威胁LLM在医疗、金融等关键领域的安全性和可靠性。

Method: 构建结合序列链接、句法依赖和注意力派生令牌关系的结构化图，使用图神经网络进行两级过滤：提示级过滤器检测全局对抗性提示，令牌级过滤器精确定位细粒度对抗性片段。

Result: 在三个数据集和多种攻击设置下，GuardNet显著优于现有防御方法：在LLM-Fuzzer上将提示级F1分数从66.4%提升至99.8%，在PLeak数据集上从67-79%提升至94%以上；令牌级F1分数从48-75%提升至74-91%，IoU增益高达+28%。

Conclusion: GuardNet尽管结构复杂，但保持了可接受的延迟，在跨域评估中泛化良好，是实际LLM部署中对抗越狱威胁的实用且鲁棒的防御方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly susceptible to jailbreak
attacks, which are adversarial prompts that bypass alignment constraints and
induce unauthorized or harmful behaviors. These vulnerabilities undermine the
safety, reliability, and trustworthiness of LLM outputs, posing critical risks
in domains such as healthcare, finance, and legal compliance. In this paper, we
propose GuardNet, a hierarchical filtering framework that detects and filters
jailbreak prompts prior to inference. GuardNet constructs structured graphs
that combine sequential links, syntactic dependencies, and attention-derived
token relations to capture both linguistic structure and contextual patterns
indicative of jailbreak behavior. It then applies graph neural networks at two
levels: (i) a prompt-level filter that detects global adversarial prompts, and
(ii) a token-level filter that pinpoints fine-grained adversarial spans.
Extensive experiments across three datasets and multiple attack settings show
that GuardNet substantially outperforms prior defenses. It raises prompt-level
F$_1$ scores from 66.4\% to 99.8\% on LLM-Fuzzer, and from 67-79\% to over 94\%
on PLeak datasets. At the token level, GuardNet improves F$_1$ from 48-75\% to
74-91\%, with IoU gains up to +28\%. Despite its structural complexity,
GuardNet maintains acceptable latency and generalizes well in cross-domain
evaluations, making it a practical and robust defense against jailbreak threats
in real-world LLM deployments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: IsingFormer是一个基于Transformer的神经网络，用于生成Ising模型的全局自旋配置，作为并行回火中的全局移动提议，显著加速蒙特卡洛采样和组合优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MCMC方法在临界点和粗糙能量景观中混合缓慢，并行回火虽然通过温度交换改善混合，但每个副本仍依赖缓慢的局部更新。

Method: 训练Transformer在平衡样本上生成整个自旋配置，作为Metropolis步骤中的全局移动提议，与单自旋翻转互补使用。

Result: 在2D Ising模型采样中准确重现磁化和自由能曲线，在3D自旋玻璃优化中找到更低能量状态，在整数分解问题中成功泛化到未见过的半素数。

Conclusion: 神经网络提议可以系统性地加速蒙特卡洛方法，通过捕捉全局结构实现更快采样和更强的组合优化性能。

Abstract: Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) underlies both statistical physics and
combinatorial optimization, but mixes slowly near critical points and in rough
landscapes. Parallel Tempering (PT) improves mixing by swapping replicas across
temperatures, yet each replica still relies on slow local updates to change its
configuration. We introduce IsingFormer, a Transformer trained on equilibrium
samples that can generate entire spin configurations resembling those from the
target distribution. These uncorrelated samples are used as proposals for
global moves within a Metropolis step in PT, complementing the usual
single-spin flips. On 2D Ising models (sampling), IsingFormer reproduces
magnetization and free-energy curves and generalizes to unseen temperatures,
including the critical region. Injecting even a single proposal sharply reduces
equilibration time, replacing thousands of local updates. On 3D spin glasses
(optimization), PT enhanced with IsingFormer finds substantially lower-energy
states, demonstrating how global moves accelerate search in rugged landscapes.
Finally, applied to integer factorization encoded as Ising problems,
IsingFormer trained on a limited set of semiprimes transfers successfully to
unseen semiprimes, boosting success rates beyond the training distribution.
Since factorization is a canonical hard benchmark, this ability to generalize
across instances highlights the potential of learning proposals that move
beyond single problems to entire families of instances. The IsingFormer
demonstrates that Monte Carlo methods can be systematically accelerated by
neural proposals that capture global structure, yielding faster sampling and
stronger performance in combinatorial optimization.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的联邦学习范式，让中央服务器不仅能聚合模型，还能主动指导新任务分配给最合适的客户端，特别是在数据分布异构的医疗场景中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前联邦学习算法主要关注从异构客户端聚合模型更新，但中央服务器的潜力未被充分探索。受医疗场景启发，思考服务器能否不仅构建模型，还能指导新患者到最适合其病情的医院。

Method: 引入基于经验似然的框架，同时解决两个目标：(1)在每个客户端上学习有效的本地模型，(2)为新查询找到最佳匹配的客户端。

Result: 在基准数据集上的实证结果表明，该框架在模型准确性和客户端指导精度方面均优于标准联邦学习方法。

Conclusion: 这项工作为构建更智能、资源效率更高的联邦系统开辟了新方向，将异构性视为特征而非缺陷。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is increasingly adopted in domains like healthcare,
where data privacy is paramount. A fundamental challenge in these systems is
statistical heterogeneity-the fact that data distributions vary significantly
across clients (e.g., different hospitals may treat distinct patient
demographics). While current FL algorithms focus on aggregating model updates
from these heterogeneous clients, the potential of the central server remains
under-explored. This paper is motivated by a healthcare scenario: could a
central server not only build a model but also guide a new patient to the
hospital best equipped for their specific condition? We generalize this idea to
propose a novel paradigm for FL systems where the server actively guides the
allocation of new tasks or queries to the most appropriate client in the
network. To enable this, we introduce an empirical likelihood-based framework
that simultaneously addresses two goals: (1) learning effective local models on
each client, and (2) finding the best matching client for a new query.
Empirical results demonstrate the framework's effectiveness on benchmark
datasets, showing improvements in both model accuracy and the precision of
client guidance compared to standard FL approaches. This work opens a new
direction for building more intelligent and resource-efficient federated
systems that leverage heterogeneity as a feature, not just a bug. Code is

TL;DR: 该论文通过链式嵌入分析揭示了大型视觉语言模型中语言先验的内部机制，发现了视觉整合点(VIP)现象，并提出了总体视觉整合(TVI)估计器来量化视觉信息对模型行为的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大型视觉语言模型往往依赖预训练中的语言先验，而未能充分利用视觉证据。传统分析方法无法揭示视觉信息何时以及如何影响模型行为的内部机制。

Method: 提出了链式嵌入分析方法，通过检查LVLMs中层间表示动态，识别视觉整合点(VIP)，并开发了总体视觉整合(TVI)估计器来量化视觉查询对响应生成的影响。

Result: 在9个当代LVLMs和6个基准测试的54个模型-数据集组合中，VIP现象普遍存在，TVI能够可靠地预测语言先验的强度。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一个诊断和理解LVLMs中语言先验的原则性工具包，揭示了视觉信息在模型内部表示中的整合机制。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) achieve strong performance on multimodal
tasks, yet they often default to their language prior (LP) -- memorized textual
patterns from pre-training while under-utilizing visual evidence. Prior
analyses of LP mostly rely on input-output probing, which fails to reveal the
internal mechanisms governing when and how vision influences model behavior. To
address this gap, we present the first systematic analysis of language prior
through the lens of chain-of-embedding, which examines the layer-wise
representation dynamics within LVLMs. Our analysis reveals a universal
phenomenon: each model exhibits a Visual Integration Point (VIP), a critical
layer at which visual information begins to meaningfully reshape hidden
representations and influence decoding. Building on this observation, we
introduce the Total Visual Integration (TVI) estimator, which aggregates
representation distance beyond the VIP to quantify how strongly visual query
influences response generation. Across 54 model-dataset combinations spanning 9
contemporary LVLMs and 6 benchmarks, we demonstrate that VIP consistently
emerges, and that TVI reliably predicts the strength of language prior. This
offers a principled toolkit for diagnosing and understanding language prior in
LVLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有学习率调度器要么遵循简单的参数函数，要么只响应短期训练信号，缺乏对神经网络训练过程的全面时间视角建模。

Method: 将神经网络训练性能建模为动态系统，利用超参数搜索的运行数据学习训练过程的潜在表示，根据当前训练指标预测具有最佳长期验证性能的未来学习率计划。

Result: 在CNN、ResNet图像分类和Transformer语言模型上达到SOTA结果，训练出的模型位于损失景观的更平坦区域，具有更好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法计算高效、优化器无关，可轻松集成到ML实验跟踪平台，为学习率调度提供了新的有效方法。

Abstract: The learning rate schedule is one of the most impactful aspects of neural
network optimization, yet most schedules either follow simple parametric
functions or react only to short-term training signals. None of them are
supported by a comprehensive temporal view of how well neural networks actually
train. We present a new learning rate scheduler that models the training
performance of neural networks as a dynamical system. It leverages training
runs from a hyperparameter search to learn a latent representation of the
training process. Given current training metrics, it predicts the future
learning rate schedule with the best long-term validation performance. Our
scheduler generalizes beyond previously observed training dynamics and creates
specialized schedules that deviate noticeably from common parametric functions.
It achieves SOTA results for image classification with CNN and ResNet models as
well as for next-token prediction with a transformer model. The trained models
are located in flatter regions of the loss landscape and thus provide better
generalization than those trained with other schedules. Our method is
computationally efficient, optimizer-agnostic, and can easily be layered on top
of ML experiment-tracking platforms. An implementation of our scheduler will be
made available after acceptance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统评估指标混淆了模型性能与数据内在不可预测性，需要新的评估框架来公平比较模型并深入理解模型行为。

Method: 开发了谱相干可预测性(SCP)评分和线性利用比率(LUR)诊断工具，前者量化预测实例的固有难度，后者测量模型利用线性可预测信息的效率。

Result: 发现了"可预测性漂移"现象，即任务的预测难度随时间急剧变化；揭示了架构权衡：复杂模型在低可预测性数据上表现更优，而线性模型在更可预测任务上非常有效。

Conclusion: 倡导从简单聚合评分转向更深入的可预测性感知评估范式，促进更公平的模型比较和更深层次的模型行为理解。

Abstract: In the era of increasingly complex AI models for time series forecasting,
progress is often measured by marginal improvements on benchmark leaderboards.
However, this approach suffers from a fundamental flaw: standard evaluation
metrics conflate a model's performance with the data's intrinsic
unpredictability. To address this pressing challenge, we introduce a novel,
predictability-aligned diagnostic framework grounded in spectral coherence. Our
framework makes two primary contributions: the Spectral Coherence
Predictability (SCP), a computationally efficient ($O(N\log N)$) and
task-aligned score that quantifies the inherent difficulty of a given
forecasting instance, and the Linear Utilization Ratio (LUR), a
frequency-resolved diagnostic tool that precisely measures how effectively a
model exploits the linearly predictable information within the data. We
validate our framework's effectiveness and leverage it to reveal two core
insights. First, we provide the first systematic evidence of "predictability
drift", demonstrating that a task's forecasting difficulty varies sharply over
time. Second, our evaluation reveals a key architectural trade-off: complex
models are superior for low-predictability data, whereas linear models are
highly effective on more predictable tasks. We advocate for a paradigm shift,
moving beyond simplistic aggregate scores toward a more insightful,
predictability-aware evaluation that fosters fairer model comparisons and a
deeper understanding of model behavior.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CLAD-Net是一个用于可穿戴传感器持续学习的框架，通过结合自监督Transformer和知识蒸馏CNN，解决了现实场景中数据分布漂移和灾难性遗忘问题，在PAMAP2数据集上取得了91.36%的准确率和仅8.78%的遗忘率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中可穿戴传感器数据存在分布漂移问题（如不同用户间的数据差异），传统深度学习模型假设数据分布稳定，导致在持续学习场景下出现灾难性遗忘。同时，人类研究中的标注数据稀缺且不一致，需要能够持续更新模型而不牺牲过去任务性能的解决方案。

Method: CLAD-Net整合了自监督Transformer（作为长期记忆）和监督CNN（通过知识蒸馏训练）。Transformer通过跨传感器注意力捕捉全局活动模式，学习无需标签的可泛化表示；CNN通过知识蒸馏在逐用户微调时保留先验知识。

Result: 在PAMAP2数据集上，CLAD-Net达到91.36%最终准确率，仅8.78%遗忘率，优于基于记忆和正则化的基线方法（如经验回放和弹性权重巩固）。在仅有10-20%标注数据的半监督设置下仍保持强劲性能，对标签稀缺具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: CLAD-Net通过结合自监督学习和知识蒸馏，有效解决了可穿戴传感器持续学习中的分布漂移和灾难性遗忘问题，为现实世界部署提供了实用解决方案，特别是在标注数据有限的情况下表现优异。

Abstract: The rise of deep learning has greatly advanced human behavior monitoring
using wearable sensors, particularly human activity recognition (HAR). While
deep models have been widely studied, most assume stationary data distributions
- an assumption often violated in real-world scenarios. For example, sensor
data from one subject may differ significantly from another, leading to
distribution shifts. In continual learning, this shift is framed as a sequence
of tasks, each corresponding to a new subject. Such settings suffer from
catastrophic forgetting, where prior knowledge deteriorates as new tasks are
learned. This challenge is compounded by the scarcity and inconsistency of
labeled data in human studies. To address these issues, we propose CLAD-Net
(Continual Learning with Attention and Distillation), a framework enabling
wearable-sensor models to be updated continuously without sacrificing
performance on past tasks. CLAD-Net integrates a self-supervised transformer,
acting as long-term memory, with a supervised Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN) trained via knowledge distillation for activity classification. The
transformer captures global activity patterns through cross-attention across
body-mounted sensors, learning generalizable representations without labels.
Meanwhile, the CNN leverages knowledge distillation to retain prior knowledge
during subject-wise fine-tuning. On PAMAP2, CLAD-Net achieves 91.36 percent
final accuracy with only 8.78 percent forgetting, surpassing memory-based and
regularization-based baselines such as Experience Replay and Elastic Weight
Consolidation. In semi-supervised settings with only 10-20 percent labeled
data, CLAD-Net still delivers strong performance, demonstrating robustness to
label scarcity. Ablation studies further validate each module's contribution.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对奇Sigmoid激活函数类的初始化方法，通过选择适当的噪声尺度来避免激活值塌陷或饱和，使网络能在不使用归一化层的情况下可靠训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 激活函数和权重初始化相互依赖，不合适的初始化会导致非线性激活函数出现饱和、方差塌陷和学习率敏感性问题，需要针对特定激活函数设计专门的初始化方法。

Method: 定义了奇Sigmoid函数类，并为该类中的任何激活函数提出了专门的初始化方法，通过闭式解选择噪声尺度，确保前向激活值在目标层之前保持良好分散。

Result: 该方法能在不使用归一化层的情况下可靠训练，表现出强大的数据效率，并使标准初始化方法（Xavier、He、正交）通常无法可靠收敛的激活函数能够学习。

Conclusion: 提出的初始化方法解决了激活函数与权重初始化之间的相互依赖问题，为奇Sigmoid类激活函数提供了有效的训练解决方案。

Abstract: Activation functions critically influence trainability and expressivity, and
recent work has therefore explored a broad range of nonlinearities. However,
activations and weight initialization are interdependent: without an
appropriate initialization method, nonlinearities can cause saturation,
variance collapse, and increased learning rate sensitivity. We address this by
defining an odd sigmoid function class and, given any activation f in this
class, proposing an initialization method tailored to f. The method selects a
noise scale in closed form so that forward activations remain well dispersed up
to a target layer, thereby avoiding collapse to zero or saturation.
Empirically, the approach trains reliably without normalization layers,
exhibits strong data efficiency, and enables learning for activations under
which standard initialization methods (Xavier, He, Orthogonal) often do not
converge reliably.

TL;DR: 提出了Distributional Flow Critic (DFC)，一种学习完整状态-动作回报分布的评论家架构，通过流匹配建模回报分布，为基于流的策略提供更稳定和丰富的学习信号。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于流的策略在离线强化学习中表现出色，但其表达能力常受限于传统评论家仅学习单一标量期望回报估计，无法充分利用策略的多模态行为建模能力。

Method: 使用流匹配技术，将回报分布建模为从简单基础分布到复杂目标回报分布的连续灵活变换，而不是回归到单一值。

Result: 在D4RL和OGBench基准测试中表现出强大性能，特别是在需要多模态动作分布的任务上，在离线和离线到在线微调方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DFC通过提供分布式的贝尔曼目标，显著提升了基于流策略的性能，证明了分布式评论家在强化学习中的重要性。

Abstract: Flow-based policies have recently emerged as a powerful tool in offline and
offline-to-online reinforcement learning, capable of modeling the complex,
multimodal behaviors found in pre-collected datasets. However, the full
potential of these expressive actors is often bottlenecked by their critics,
which typically learn a single, scalar estimate of the expected return. To
address this limitation, we introduce the Distributional Flow Critic (DFC), a
novel critic architecture that learns the complete state-action return
distribution. Instead of regressing to a single value, DFC employs flow
matching to model the distribution of return as a continuous, flexible
transformation from a simple base distribution to the complex target
distribution of returns. By doing so, DFC provides the expressive flow-based
policy with a rich, distributional Bellman target, which offers a more stable
and informative learning signal. Extensive experiments across D4RL and OGBench
benchmarks demonstrate that our approach achieves strong performance,
especially on tasks requiring multimodal action distributions, and excels in
both offline and offline-to-online fine-tuning compared to existing methods.

TL;DR: 对网络基础模型(NFMs)潜在知识的系统研究，通过嵌入几何分析、度量对齐评估和因果敏感性测试三个维度评估模型，发现现有模型存在显著各向异性、特征敏感性不一致等问题，解决这些问题可显著提升性能。


<details>

Motivation: 现有研究主要关注下游任务性能，而忽略了模型内部潜在知识的分析。本文旨在系统研究NFMs编码的潜在知识，重点关注隐藏表示分析而非纯粹的下游任务表现。

Method: 采用三部分评估方法：1)嵌入几何分析评估表示空间利用；2)度量对齐评估测量与领域专家特征的对应关系；3)因果敏感性测试评估对协议扰动的鲁棒性。使用5个不同网络数据集评估4个最先进的NFMs。

Result: 发现所有模型都表现出显著的各向异性、不一致的特征敏感性模式、无法分离高层上下文、有效载荷依赖性等特性。通过解决这些限制，可以在不改变架构的情况下显著提高模型性能（F1分数最高提升0.35）。

Conclusion: 本研究识别了所有模型中的众多限制，并证明解决这些限制可以显著改善模型性能，为网络基础模型的改进提供了重要见解。

Abstract: This work presents a systematic investigation into the latent knowledge
encoded within Network Foundation Models (NFMs) that focuses on hidden
representations analysis rather than pure downstream task performance.
Different from existing efforts, we analyze the models through a three-part
evaluation: Embedding Geometry Analysis to assess representation space
utilization, Metric Alignment Assessment to measure correspondence with
domain-expert features, and Causal Sensitivity Testing to evaluate robustness
to protocol perturbations. Using five diverse network datasets spanning
controlled and real-world environments, we evaluate four state-of-the-art NFMs,
revealing that they all exhibit significant anisotropy, inconsistent feature
sensitivity patterns, an inability to separate the high-level context, payload
dependency, and other properties. Our work identifies numerous limitations
across all models and demonstrates that addressing them can significantly
improve model performance (by up to +0.35 $F_1$ score without architectural

*Christopher Scarvelis,Justin Solomon*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种计算扩散模型对训练数据扰动的敏感性的方法，无需重新训练即可预测模型输出的变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型训练近似于从数据分布到最优评分函数的映射，但该映射的导数难以计算。如果能够计算该导数，就可以在重新训练前预测模型对训练数据微小扰动的响应。

Method: 开发了一种闭式程序来计算该映射的方向导数，仅需黑盒访问预训练评分模型及其对输入的导数。该方法扩展到估计扩散模型样本对目标度量加性扰动的敏感性。

Result: 该方法计算效率高，运行时间与从扩散模型采样和计算样本路径对数似然相当。对数值和近似误差具有鲁棒性，所得敏感性与图像扩散模型重新训练和微调后的样本变化相关。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能够有效预测扩散模型对训练数据扰动的响应，为模型敏感性分析提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Training a diffusion model approximates a map from a data distribution $\rho$
to the optimal score function $s_t$ for that distribution. Can we differentiate
this map? If we could, then we could predict how the score, and ultimately the
model's samples, would change under small perturbations to the training set
before committing to costly retraining. We give a closed-form procedure for
computing this map's directional derivatives, relying only on black-box access
to a pre-trained score model and its derivatives with respect to its inputs. We
extend this result to estimate the sensitivity of a diffusion model's samples
to additive perturbations of its target measure, with runtime comparable to
sampling from a diffusion model and computing log-likelihoods along the sample
path. Our method is robust to numerical and approximation error, and the
resulting sensitivities correlate with changes in an image diffusion model's
samples after retraining and fine-tuning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CE-PO是一种增强策略优化的奖励塑造框架，通过Jacobian敏感性估计模型内部影响，抑制干扰线索，将因果一致性分数与任务准确性反馈融合，减少奖励欺骗和不忠实的思维链推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在强化学习训练中常通过捷径策略获得表面正确的答案，但推理过程可能不忠实，且在小因果扰动下表现下降。

Method: 使用Jacobian敏感性估计模型内部影响，通过反事实强化抑制干扰线索，将因果一致性分数与任务准确性反馈通过Minkowski组合器融合。

Result: 在4个数据集上的实验显示，CE-PO平均比基线提高5.49%的准确率（最高9.58%），同时提高了对相关-因果翻转和轻微反事实编辑的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: CE-PO框架有效减少了奖励欺骗和不忠实的思维链推理，在保持准确性的同时显著提高了模型的因果鲁棒性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) trained with reinforcement objectives often
achieve superficially correct answers via shortcut strategies, pairing correct
outputs with spurious or unfaithful reasoning and degrading under small causal
perturbations. We introduce Causally-Enhanced Policy Optimization (CE-PO), a
drop-in reward-shaping framework that augments policy optimization with a
differentiable proxy for causal coherence along the generation pathway from
prompt (Z) to rationale (X) to answer (Y). CE-PO estimates model-internal
influence with Jacobian-based sensitivities, counterfactually hardens these
signals to suppress nuisance cues, and fuses the resulting coherence score with
task-accuracy feedback via a Minkowski (power-mean) combiner, exposing a single
tunable between accuracy and coherence trade-off. The unified reward integrates
with PPO/GRPO without architectural changes. Across reasoning benchmarks and
causal stress tests, CE-PO reduces reward hacking and unfaithful
chain-of-thought while improving robustness to correlation-causation flips and
light counterfactual edits, all at near-parity accuracy. Experimental results
across 4 datasets show that CE-PO improves accuracy over baselines by 5.49% on
average (up to 9.58%), while improving robustness to correlation-causation
flips and light counterfactual edits.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 区块链的匿名性为非法活动创造了机会，传统反洗钱方法难以有效检测欺诈交易，需要能够同时捕捉结构性和时间依赖性且对噪声、不平衡和对抗行为具有鲁棒性的模型。

Method: 使用集成学习框架整合图卷积网络(GCN)、图注意力网络(GAT)和图同构网络(GIN)，采用软投票集成策略，并设计了量子就绪架构以便未来集成量子特征映射和混合量子经典图神经网络。

Result: 在真实世界的Elliptic数据集上，调优后的软投票集成实现了对非法交易的高召回率，同时保持误报率低于1%，优于单个GNN模型和基线方法。

Conclusion: 集成图神经网络是实时加密货币监控的实用且前瞻性解决方案，既提供即时反洗钱效用，又为量子增强的金融安全分析开辟了路径。

Abstract: Blockchain Business applications and cryptocurrencies such as enable secure,
decentralized value transfer, yet their pseudonymous nature creates
opportunities for illicit activity, challenging regulators and exchanges in
anti money laundering (AML) enforcement. Detecting fraudulent transactions in
blockchain networks requires models that can capture both structural and
temporal dependencies while remaining resilient to noise, imbalance, and
adversarial behavior. In this work, we propose an ensemble framework that
integrates Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN), Graph Attention Networks (GAT),
and Graph Isomorphism Networks (GIN) to enhance blockchain fraud detection.
Using the real-world Elliptic dataset, our tuned soft voting ensemble achieves
high recall of illicit transactions while maintaining a false positive rate
below 1%, beating individual GNN models and baseline methods. The modular
architecture incorporates quantum-ready design hooks, allowing seamless future
integration of quantum feature mappings and hybrid quantum classical graph
neural networks. This ensures scalability, robustness, and long-term
adaptability as quantum computing technologies mature. Our findings highlight
ensemble GNNs as a practical and forward-looking solution for real-time
cryptocurrency monitoring, providing both immediate AML utility and a pathway
toward quantum-enhanced financial security analytics.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了8位Muon优化器，使用分块量化技术，在保持性能的同时显著减少内存占用，相比全精度Muon减少约74%内存。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Muon优化器在LLM预训练中表现出比AdamW更快的收敛速度和计算效率，但像AdamW一样是有状态的，需要存储模型权重和累积梯度。现有的8位AdamW变体通常只在动态量化下稳定，本研究旨在开发支持线性和动态量化的8位Muon优化器。

Method: 使用分块量化技术实现8位Muon优化器，支持线性和动态两种量化方案。通过理论分析解释其在量化下的鲁棒性。

Result: 8位Muon在预训练1.6B模型和微调Llama 3.2 3B模型时，性能与全精度Muon相当，同时优于AdamW和8位AdamW。内存占用相比全精度Muon减少约74%。

Conclusion: 8位Muon优化器在保持性能的同时显著减少内存需求，为大规模模型训练提供了高效的内存优化解决方案。

Abstract: The Muon optimizer, based on matrix orthogonalization, has recently shown
faster convergence and up to 2x computational efficiency over AdamW in LLM
pretraining. Like AdamW, Muon is stateful, requiring storage of both model
weights and accumulated gradients. While 8-bit AdamW variants mitigate this
overhead using blockwise quantization, they are typically stable only under
dynamic quantization - which improves stability on linear quantization for
extreme values. In this paper, we introduce the 8-bit Muon optimizer using
blockwise quantization, supporting both linear and dynamic schemes. We
demonstrate that 8-bit Muon maintains stability under both, while delivering
$\sim$74\% reduction in memory footprint compared to full-precision Muon. In
extensive experiments, 8-bit Muon closely matches the performance of Muon while
outperforming AdamW and 8-bit AdamW in pre-training a 1.6B model on 4B FineWeb
tokens. It also shows competitive results when fine-tuning the Llama 3.2 3B
model on post-training data. We also provide a theoretical perspective to help
explain this robustness under quantization.

TL;DR: RHYTHM是一个基于大语言模型的人类移动预测框架，通过时间标记化和分层注意力机制处理复杂的长程依赖和多尺度周期性行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类移动预测面临复杂长程依赖和多尺度周期性行为的挑战，需要一种能够有效捕捉时空模式的方法。

Method: 使用时间标记化将轨迹分割为日段并编码为离散标记，采用分层注意力捕获日和周的依赖关系，通过冻结的LLM添加预计算提示嵌入来丰富标记表示。

Result: 在三个真实数据集上评估，RHYTHM相比最先进方法在整体准确率上提升2.4%，周末准确率提升5.0%，训练时间减少24.6%。

Conclusion: RHYTHM证明了LLM作为通用时空预测器和轨迹推理器的有效性，通过分层时间标记化和冻结LLM骨干网络实现了高效准确的人类移动预测。

Abstract: Predicting human mobility is inherently challenging due to complex long-range
dependencies and multi-scale periodic behaviors. To address this, we introduce
RHYTHM (Reasoning with Hierarchical Temporal Tokenization for Human Mobility),
a unified framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) as
general-purpose spatio-temporal predictors and trajectory reasoners.
Methodologically, RHYTHM employs temporal tokenization to partition each
trajectory into daily segments and encode them as discrete tokens with
hierarchical attention that captures both daily and weekly dependencies,
thereby significantly reducing the sequence length while preserving cyclical
information. Additionally, we enrich token representations by adding
pre-computed prompt embeddings for trajectory segments and prediction targets
via a frozen LLM, and feeding these combined embeddings back into the LLM
backbone to capture complex interdependencies. Computationally, RHYTHM freezes
the pretrained LLM's backbone to reduce attention complexity and memory cost.
We evaluate our model against state-of-the-art methods using three real-world
datasets. Notably, RHYTHM achieves a 2.4% improvement in overall accuracy, a
5.0% increase on weekends, and a 24.6% reduction in training time. Code is

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Impute-MACFM，一种用于表格数据插补的掩码感知条件流匹配框架，能够处理不同类型的缺失机制，在多种基准测试中实现最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 表格数据在医疗等应用中很常见，但缺失值问题普遍存在，会降低模型保真度和可靠性。现有方法要么假设限制性强，要么难以处理复杂的跨特征结构，而生成方法存在不稳定和推理成本高的问题。

Method: 采用掩码感知目标函数，仅在缺失条目上构建轨迹，同时约束预测速度在观测条目上接近零；结合稳定性惩罚、一致性正则化和时间衰减噪声注入；使用约束保持的ODE积分进行推理。

Result: 在多样化基准测试中实现了最先进的性能，提供了比竞争方法更鲁棒、高效和高质量的插补结果。

Conclusion: 流匹配是解决表格缺失数据问题（包括纵向数据）的一个有前景的方向。

Abstract: Tabular data are central to many applications, especially longitudinal data
in healthcare, where missing values are common, undermining model fidelity and
reliability. Prior imputation methods either impose restrictive assumptions or
struggle with complex cross-feature structure, while recent generative
approaches suffer from instability and costly inference. We propose
Impute-MACFM, a mask-aware conditional flow matching framework for tabular
imputation that addresses missingness mechanisms, missing completely at random,
missing at random, and missing not at random. Its mask-aware objective builds
trajectories only on missing entries while constraining predicted velocity to
remain near zero on observed entries, using flexible nonlinear schedules.
Impute-MACFM combines: (i) stability penalties on observed positions, (ii)
consistency regularization enforcing local invariance, and (iii) time-decayed
noise injection for numeric features. Inference uses constraint-preserving
ordinary differential equation integration with per-step projection to fix
observed values, optionally aggregating multiple trajectories for robustness.
Across diverse benchmarks, Impute-MACFM achieves state-of-the-art results while
delivering more robust, efficient, and higher-quality imputation than competing
approaches, establishing flow matching as a promising direction for tabular
missing-data problems, including longitudinal data.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习方法（如GRPO及其变体）存在严重的过度自信问题，阻碍了自感知推理模型的发展。

Method: 提出Group Sequence Policy Gradient (GSPG)框架消除token级偏差，使用归一化序列级概率定义模型置信度，并应用交叉熵正则器将模型置信度校准到序列奖励。

Result: 在逻辑和数学推理任务中，C²GSPG在推理准确性和置信度校准方面均优于最先进方法。

Conclusion: C²GSPG通过序列级策略梯度和置信度校准的协同作用，有效解决了强化学习中的过度自信问题，提升了推理模型的性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods, exemplified by Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) and its variants, play a central role in developing
reasoning models. However, these methods often suffer from a critical
overconfidence issue, which prevents them from achieving self-aware reasoning
models. In this study, we propose a simple yet effective confidence-calibration
group sequence policy gradient method, called C$^2$GSPG, which simultaneously
enhances reasoning performance while suppressing overconfidence. In principle,
we propose a Group Sequence Policy Gradient (GSPG) framework for learning
reasoning models, which eliminates the token-level bias commonly appearing in
GRPO and its variants. In this framework, we define the model confidence for
each reasoning problem using the normalized sequence-level probability, and
then apply a cross-entropy regularizer to calibrate the model confidence to the
sequence's reward. We demonstrate that the confidence calibration regularizer
and GSPG are collaborative for binary rewards, as their objectives always share
the same gradient direction. For non-binary rewards, we apply nonlinear reward
normalization and adaptive regularizer clipping, mitigating the potential
conflict between the two objectives. Applying C$^2$GSPG to post-train large
language models in logical and mathematical reasoning tasks, we show its
superiority over state-of-the-art methods in both reasoning accuracy and
confidence calibration. The code of C$^2$GSPG is available at
https://github.com/HaotianLiu123/CCGSPG.

Motivation: 传统对抗式IRL方法训练不稳定，而近期非对抗式方法虽然稳定性提高但缺乏理论保证，需要填补这一空白。

Method: 提出TRRO框架，通过Minorization-Maximization过程保证单调改进，并实例化为PIRO算法，联合学习奖励函数和策略。

Result: PIRO在MuJoCo、Gym-Robotics基准测试和真实动物行为建模任务中，在奖励恢复、策略模仿和样本效率方面达到或超越最先进基线方法。

Conclusion: TRRO为IRL提供了类似TRPO的稳定性理论保证，PIRO算法在实践中表现出色，填补了非对抗式IRL方法缺乏理论保证的空白。

Abstract: Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) learns a reward function to explain
expert demonstrations. Modern IRL methods often use the adversarial (minimax)
formulation that alternates between reward and policy optimization, which often
lead to unstable training. Recent non-adversarial IRL approaches improve
stability by jointly learning reward and policy via energy-based formulations
but lack formal guarantees. This work bridges this gap. We first present a
unified view showing canonical non-adversarial methods explicitly or implicitly
maximize the likelihood of expert behavior, which is equivalent to minimizing
the expected return gap. This insight leads to our main contribution: Trust
Region Reward Optimization (TRRO), a framework that guarantees monotonic
improvement in this likelihood via a Minorization-Maximization process. We
instantiate TRRO into Proximal Inverse Reward Optimization (PIRO), a practical
and stable IRL algorithm. Theoretically, TRRO provides the IRL counterpart to
the stability guarantees of Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO) in forward
RL. Empirically, PIRO matches or surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in reward
recovery, policy imitation with high sample efficiency on MuJoCo and
Gym-Robotics benchmarks and a real-world animal behavior modeling task.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前INR配置缺乏原则性策略，依赖临时启发式方法、暴力网格搜索或任务特定调优，导致跨模态结果不一致，限制了INR在信号处理和计算机视觉任务中的有效性。

Method: 利用贝叶斯优化在离散激活函数族（如SIREN、WIRE、FINER）及其相关连续初始化参数的联合空间中进行高效探索，系统化地替代碎片化手动调优。

Result: OptiINR能够提供全局最优配置，为INR设计建立原则性基础，在多样化信号处理应用中持续最大化性能。

Conclusion: OptiINR通过数据驱动的优化过程，为隐式神经表示提供了系统化的配置方法，解决了当前配置策略的局限性。

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have emerged as a transformative
paradigm in signal processing and computer vision, excelling in tasks from
image reconstruction to 3D shape modeling. Yet their effectiveness is
fundamentally limited by the absence of principled strategies for optimal
configuration - spanning activation selection, initialization scales,
layer-wise adaptation, and their intricate interdependencies. These choices
dictate performance, stability, and generalization, but current practice relies
on ad-hoc heuristics, brute-force grid searches, or task-specific tuning, often
leading to inconsistent results across modalities. This work introduces
OptiINR, the first unified framework that formulates INR configuration as a
rigorous optimization problem. Leveraging Bayesian optimization, OptiINR
efficiently explores the joint space of discrete activation families - such as
sinusoidal (SIREN), wavelet-based (WIRE), and variable-periodic (FINER) - and
their associated continuous initialization parameters. This systematic approach
replaces fragmented manual tuning with a coherent, data-driven optimization
process. By delivering globally optimal configurations, OptiINR establishes a
principled foundation for INR design, consistently maximizing performance
across diverse signal processing applications.

TL;DR: 提出Temporal Mix of Experts (TMOE)机制，将键值对重新构想为局部专家，通过局部过滤无关时间戳实现自适应专家选择，同时保留全局专家以捕捉长期依赖关系，在多个时间序列预测基准上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Transformer在时间序列建模中的两个关键挑战：(1)固有的滞后效应，历史时间戳与查询的相关性动态变化；(2)异常片段引入噪声信号降低预测准确性。

Method: 提出TMOE机制，将键值对视为局部专家，为每个查询自适应选择专家，通过局部过滤无关时间戳，同时保留共享全局专家。将TMOE集成到PatchTST和Timer框架中，形成TimeExpert和TimeExpert-G。

Result: 在7个真实世界长期预测基准上的广泛实验表明，TimeExpert和TimeExpert-G优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: TMOE机制有效解决了时间序列建模中的滞后效应和异常片段问题，在不改变结构的情况下提升了Transformer框架的性能。

Abstract: Transformer-based architectures dominate time series modeling by enabling
global attention over all timestamps, yet their rigid 'one-size-fits-all'
context aggregation fails to address two critical challenges in real-world
data: (1) inherent lag effects, where the relevance of historical timestamps to
a query varies dynamically; (2) anomalous segments, which introduce noisy
signals that degrade forecasting accuracy. To resolve these problems, we
propose the Temporal Mix of Experts (TMOE), a novel attention-level mechanism
that reimagines key-value (K-V) pairs as local experts (each specialized in a
distinct temporal context) and performs adaptive expert selection for each
query via localized filtering of irrelevant timestamps. Complementing this
local adaptation, a shared global expert preserves the Transformer's strength
in capturing long-range dependencies. We then replace the vanilla attention
mechanism in popular time-series Transformer frameworks (i.e., PatchTST and
Timer) with TMOE, without extra structural modifications, yielding our specific
version TimeExpert and general version TimeExpert-G. Extensive experiments on
seven real-world long-term forecasting benchmarks demonstrate that TimeExpert
and TimeExpert-G outperform state-of-the-art methods. Code is available at

Result: Mirror-Verifier在解准确率方面显著优于多数投票，同时提高了求解器识别并放弃回答超出能力边界问题的诚实性。

Conclusion: Mirror-Critique框架通过提供信息性批判信号，有效提升了LLM的推理性能和诚实性。

Abstract: Test-time scaling via solution sampling and aggregation has become a key
paradigm for improving the reasoning performance of Large Language Models
(LLMs). While reward model selection is commonly employed in this approach, it
often fails to identify minority-yet-correct answers, which limits its
effectiveness beyond that of simple majority voting. We argue that this
limitation stems from a lack of informative critique signals during verifier
training. To bridge this gap, we introduce Mirror-Critique, a framework that
trains a verifier with informative critiques. Our key insight is to leverage
the rich critique signal by contrasting model-generated solutions with
ground-truth solutions. We deploy a small instruction-tuned model to synthesize
high-quality critique data with rejection sampling that teaches the verifier
not only what is wrong, but also why. The synthetic data is used to cold-start
the LLMs in the RLVR process to further improve the verification ability. The
resulting Mirror-Verifier is deployed to evaluate candidate solutions by
generating multiple critiques per solution, aggregating them into a verify
score used for weighted voting or selective abstention. The experimental
results show that our Mirror-Verifier significantly outperforms majority voting
in terms of solution accuracy and also improves the solver's honesty to
recognize and abstain from answering beyond its capability boundaries.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前材料设计主要依赖高精度的DFT计算，但机器学习方法很少直接使用DFT信号作为反馈，主要是因为DFT计算成本高昂。

Method: 提出CrystalGym强化学习环境，评估了常见的基于价值和策略的强化学习算法，用于设计具有目标性质（如带隙、体模量、密度）的晶体。

Conclusion: CrystalGym旨在作为强化学习研究者和材料科学家的测试平台，为处理耗时奖励信号的强化学习方法引入新的挑战类别。

Abstract: In silico design and optimization of new materials primarily relies on
high-accuracy atomic simulators that perform density functional theory (DFT)
calculations. While recent works showcase the strong potential of machine
learning to accelerate the material design process, they mostly consist of
generative approaches that do not use direct DFT signals as feedback to improve
training and generation mainly due to DFT's high computational cost. To aid the
adoption of direct DFT signals in the materials design loop through online
reinforcement learning (RL), we propose CrystalGym, an open-source RL
environment for crystalline material discovery. Using CrystalGym, we benchmark
common value- and policy-based reinforcement learning algorithms for designing
various crystals conditioned on target properties. Concretely, we optimize for
challenging properties like the band gap, bulk modulus, and density, which are
directly calculated from DFT in the environment. While none of the algorithms
we benchmark solve all CrystalGym tasks, our extensive experiments and
ablations show different sample efficiencies and ease of convergence to
optimality for different algorithms and environment settings. Additionally, we
include a case study on the scope of fine-tuning large language models with
reinforcement learning for improving DFT-based rewards. Our goal is for
CrystalGym to serve as a test bed for reinforcement learning researchers and
material scientists to address these real-world design problems with practical
applications. We therefore introduce a novel class of challenges for
reinforcement learning methods dealing with time-consuming reward signals,
paving the way for future interdisciplinary research for machine learning
motivated by real-world applications.

Abstract: Early detection of cognitive impairment is critical for timely diagnosis and
intervention, yet infrequent clinical assessments often lack the sensitivity
and temporal resolution to capture subtle cognitive declines in older adults.
Passive smartphone sensing has emerged as a promising approach for naturalistic
and continuous cognitive monitoring. Building on this potential, we implemented
a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to detect cognitive impairment from
sequences of daily behavioral features, derived from multimodal sensing data
collected in an ongoing one-year study of older adults. Our key contributions
are two techniques to enhance model generalizability across participants: (1)
routine-aware augmentation, which generates synthetic sequences by replacing
each day with behaviorally similar alternatives, and (2) demographic
personalization, which reweights training samples to emphasize those from
individuals demographically similar to the test participant. Evaluated on
6-month data from 36 older adults, these techniques jointly improved the Area
Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC) of the model trained on sensing and
demographic features from 0.637 to 0.766, highlighting the potential of
scalable monitoring of cognitive impairment in aging populations with passive
sensing.

process for building trust in high-stakes scenarios. Existing interpretable
models often provide only local and partial explanations, lacking the
capability to reveal how heterogeneous and interacting input variables jointly
shape the overall temporal patterns in the forecast curve. We propose ProtoTS,
a novel interpretable forecasting framework that achieves both high accuracy
and transparent decision-making through modeling prototypical temporal
patterns. ProtoTS computes instance-prototype similarity based on a denoised
representation that preserves abundant heterogeneous information. The
prototypes are organized hierarchically to capture global temporal patterns
with coarse prototypes while capturing finer-grained local variations with
detailed prototypes, enabling expert steering and multi-level interpretability.
Experiments on multiple realistic benchmarks, including a newly released LOF
dataset, show that ProtoTS not only exceeds existing methods in forecast
accuracy but also delivers expert-steerable interpretations for better model
understanding and decision support.

*Chandan Tankala,Krishnakumar Balasubramanian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 将密集关联记忆从向量扩展到概率分布，主要关注具有2-Wasserstein距离的Bures-Wasserstein类高斯密度，通过定义log-sum-exp能量和基于最优传输图的检索动态，实现分布存储和检索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有密集关联记忆模型仅限于向量表示，需要扩展到概率分布以支持更复杂的分布存储和检索任务，连接经典关联记忆与现代生成建模。

Method: 定义基于存储分布的log-sum-exp能量函数，以及通过Gibbs加权方式聚合最优传输图的检索动态，固定点对应于自一致的Wasserstein重心。

Result: 证明了指数存储容量，提供了Wasserstein扰动下的定量检索保证，并在合成和真实世界分布任务上验证了模型性能。

Conclusion: 该工作将关联记忆从向量提升到完整分布，连接经典密集关联记忆与现代生成建模，为记忆增强学习中的分布存储和检索提供了新框架。

Abstract: Dense associative memories (DAMs) store and retrieve patterns via
energy-functional fixed points, but existing models are limited to vector
representations. We extend DAMs to probability distributions equipped with the
2-Wasserstein distance, focusing mainly on the Bures-Wasserstein class of
Gaussian densities. Our framework defines a log-sum-exp energy over stored
distributions and a retrieval dynamics aggregating optimal transport maps in a
Gibbs-weighted manner. Stationary points correspond to self-consistent
Wasserstein barycenters, generalizing classical DAM fixed points. We prove
exponential storage capacity, provide quantitative retrieval guarantees under
Wasserstein perturbations, and validate the model on synthetic and real-world
distributional tasks. This work elevates associative memory from vectors to
full distributions, bridging classical DAMs with modern generative modeling and
enabling distributional storage and retrieval in memory-augmented learning.

*Hangwei Zhang,Chun Kang,Yan Wang,Difan Zou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文首次系统研究了科学机器学习中预训练大算子模型（LOMs）的参数高效微调（PEFT），发现LoRA在LOMs上表现不佳，而适配器调优更有效。作者提出了频率自适应适配器（F-Adapter），根据频谱复杂度分配适配器容量，在多个3D Navier-Stokes基准测试中取得了最先进的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 参数高效微调在视觉和语言处理中已被证明有效，但在科学机器学习中尚未探索。本文旨在研究PEFT在预训练大算子模型中的应用，以建模复杂物理系统。

Method: 1. 系统比较LoRA和适配器调优在LOMs上的性能；2. 理论分析LoRA在傅里叶层中的近似误差；3. 提出频率自适应适配器（F-Adapter），根据频谱复杂度分配适配器容量，低频分量使用高维模块，高频分量使用低维模块。

Result: F-Adapter在多个挑战性3D Navier-Stokes基准测试中建立了最先进的结果，显著提高了泛化能力和频谱保真度，优于LoRA和其他常用于LLMs的PEFT技术。

Conclusion: 本文首次探索了科学机器学习中的PEFT，并确立了F-Adapter作为该领域有效范式的地位。适配器调优在LOMs上比LoRA更有效，F-Adapter通过频谱自适应分配进一步提升了性能。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) of powerful pre-trained models for
complex downstream tasks has proven effective in vision and language
processing, yet this paradigm remains unexplored in scientific machine
learning, where the objective is to model complex physical systems. We conduct
the first systematic study of PEFT for pre-trained Large Operator Models (LOMs)
obtained by scaling variants of Fourier Neural Operator. First, we observe that
the widely used Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) yields markedly poorer performance
on LOMs than Adapter tuning. Then, we further theoretically establish that
stacked LoRA incurs a depth-amplified lower bound on approximation error within
Fourier layers, whereas adapters retain universal approximation capacity and,
by concentrating parameters on energy-dominant low-frequency modes, attain
exponentially decaying error with bottleneck width in the Fourier domain.
Motivated by the robust empirical gains of adapters and by our theoretical
characterization of PDE solutions as spectrally sparse, we introduce
Frequency-Adaptive Adapter (F-Adapter). F-Adapter allocates adapter capacity
based on spectral complexity, assigning higher-dimension modules to
low-frequency components and lower-dimension modules to high-frequency
components. Our F-Adapters establish state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on
multiple challenging 3D Navier-Stokes benchmarks, markedly enhancing both
generalization and spectral fidelity over LoRA and other PEFT techniques
commonly used in LLMs. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to
explore PEFT for scientific machine-learning and establishes F-Adapter as an
effective paradigm for this domain.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ZeroSiam是一种用于测试时熵最小化的高效非对称孪生架构，通过非对称散度对齐防止模型崩溃，在视觉适应和大语言模型推理任务中表现稳定。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 纯熵最小化可能导致模型选择不可泛化的捷径，如膨胀logit范数或将所有预测推向主导类别来减少熵，从而产生崩溃解。

Method: 采用非对称孪生架构，通过可学习预测器和分类器前的停止梯度操作实现非对称散度对齐，防止崩溃。

Result: ZeroSiam不仅防止崩溃解，还能吸收和正则化有偏学习信号，在多种测试场景和模型上表现稳定，包括特别容易崩溃的小型模型。

Conclusion: ZeroSiam通过简单高效的设计解决了测试时熵最小化的崩溃问题，在视觉适应和语言模型推理任务中展现出优越性能。

Abstract: Test-time entropy minimization helps adapt a model to novel environments and
incentivize its reasoning capability, unleashing the model's potential during
inference by allowing it to evolve and improve in real-time using its own
predictions, achieving promising performance. However, pure entropy
minimization can favor non-generalizable shortcuts, such as inflating the logit
norm and driving all predictions to a dominant class to reduce entropy, risking
collapsed solutions (e.g., constant one-hot outputs) that trivially minimize
the objective without meaningful learning. In this paper, we introduce
ZeroSiam, an efficient asymmetric Siamese architecture tailored for test-time
entropy minimization. ZeroSiam prevents collapse through asymmetric divergence
alignment, which is efficiently achieved by a learnable predictor and a
stop-gradient operator before the classifier. We provide empirical and
theoretical evidence that ZeroSiam not only prevents collapse solutions, but
also absorbs and regularizes biased learning signals, enhancing performance
even when no collapse occurs. Despite its simplicity, extensive results show
that ZeroSiam performs more stably over prior methods using negligible
overhead, demonstrating efficacy on both vision adaptation and large language
model reasoning tasks across challenging test scenarios and diverse models,
including tiny models that are particularly collapse-prone.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习面临恶意客户端攻击和参与者激励不足的挑战，需要在保护隐私的同时确保系统安全和效率。

Method: 采用主动警报机制和鲁棒聚合防御拜占庭和推理攻击，使用Tullock竞赛激励模块奖励诚实客户端，将服务器与客户端交互建模为两阶段Stackelberg博弈。

Result: 实验结果表明CoSIFL在提高模型鲁棒性和降低服务器总成本方面优于现有解决方案。

Conclusion: CoSIFL通过集成安全、隐私和激励机制，有效解决了联邦学习中的关键挑战，实现了系统效率和鲁棒性的平衡。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for collaborative
model training while preserving data locality. However, it still faces
challenges from malicious or compromised clients, as well as difficulties in
incentivizing participants to contribute high-quality data under strict privacy
requirements. Motivated by these considerations, we propose CoSIFL, a novel
framework that integrates proactive alarming for robust security and local
differential privacy (LDP) for inference attacks, together with a
Stackelberg-based incentive scheme to encourage client participation and data
sharing. Specifically, CoSIFL uses an active alarming mechanism and robust
aggregation to defend against Byzantine and inference attacks, while a Tullock
contest-inspired incentive module rewards honest clients for both data
contributions and reliable alarm triggers. We formulate the interplay between
the server and clients as a two-stage game: in the first stage, the server
determines total rewards, selects participants, and fixes global iteration
settings, whereas in the second stage, each client decides its mini-batch size,
privacy noise scale, and alerting strategy. We prove that the server-client
game admits a unique equilibrium, and analyze how clients' multi-dimensional
attributes - such as non-IID degrees and privacy budgets - jointly affect
system efficiency. Experimental results on standard benchmarks demonstrate that
CoSIFL outperforms state-of-the-art solutions in improving model robustness and
reducing total server costs, highlighting the effectiveness of our integrated
design.

TL;DR: 本文首次全面研究了MXFP4和NVFP4两种4位浮点格式在LLM推理中的实际表现，发现现有方法在FP4量化中存在两个关键问题，并提出了MR-GPTQ算法来解决这些问题，实现了显著的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 硬件加速的4位浮点格式（MXFP4和NVFP4）承诺革新LLM推理，但其实际效益尚未得到验证。本文旨在评估这些格式的实际性能并解决现有量化方法在FP4上的局限性。

Method: 提出了Micro-Rotated-GPTQ（MR-GPTQ）算法，通过块级Hadamard变换和格式特定优化来适配FP4的独特特性，并开发了高性能GPU内核实现旋转融合和快速激活计算。

Result: MR-GPTQ在NVIDIA B200上实现了层级3.6倍和端到端2.2倍的加速，在RTX5090上实现了层级6倍和端到端4倍的加速。实验表明MR-GPTQ显著提升了MXFP4的精度，使其接近NVFP4水平。

Conclusion: 虽然FP4不是INT4的自动升级，但像MR-GPTQ这样的格式专用方法可以解锁精度与性能权衡的新前沿。

Abstract: The recent hardware-accelerated microscaling 4-bit floating-point formats
such as MXFP4 and NVFP4, supported on NVIDIA and AMD GPUs, promise to
revolutionize large language model (LLM) inference. Yet, their practical
benefits remain unproven. We present the first comprehensive study of MXFP4 and
NVFP4 for post-training quantization, revealing gaps between their promise and
real-world performance. Our analysis shows that state-of-the-art methods
struggle with FP4, due to two key issues: (1) NVFP4's small group size provably
neutralizes traditional outlier mitigation techniques; (2) MXFP4's power-of-two
scale quantization severely degrades accuracy due to high induced error. To
bridge this gap, we introduce Micro-Rotated-GPTQ (MR-GPTQ), a variant of the
classic GPTQ quantization algorithm that tailors the quantization process to
FP4's unique properties, by using block-wise Hadamard transforms and
format-specific optimizations. We support our proposal with a set of
high-performance GPU kernels that enable the MR-GPTQ format with negligible
overhead, by rotation fusion into the weights, and fast online computation of
the activations. This leads to speedups vs. FP16 of up to 3.6x layer-wise, and
2.2x end-to-end on NVIDIA B200, and of 6x layer-wise and 4x end-to-end on
RTX5090. Our extensive empirical evaluation demonstrates that MR-GPTQ matches
or outperforms state-of-the-art accuracy, significantly boosting MXFP4, to the
point where it nears that of NVFP4. We conclude that, while FP4 is not an
automatic upgrade over INT4, format-specialized methods like MR-GPTQ can unlock
a new frontier of accuracy-performance trade-offs.

TL;DR: 本文提出了上下文价值感知的上下文强化学习(CV-ICRL)，通过引入上下文价值来解决ICRL中的上下文模糊性问题，有效防止测试时性能下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ICRL方法在测试时无法像训练数据那样持续改进性能，存在上下文模糊性问题，即模型自身的随机动作可能生成与训练数据中次优策略相似的交互历史，导致性能下降的恶性循环。

Method: 提出CV-ICRL方法，在训练阶段引入上下文价值作为显式信号，表示给定当前上下文时策略理论上可达到的理想性能。提出了两种在训练和测试时估计上下文价值的方法。

Result: 在Dark Room和Minigrid测试平台上的实验表明，CV-ICRL有效缓解了性能下降问题，并在各种任务和环境中提升了ICRL的整体能力。

Conclusion: CV-ICRL通过上下文价值解决了ICRL中的上下文模糊性问题，为开发能够持续改进性能的上下文强化学习代理提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In-Context Reinforcement Learning (ICRL) has emerged as a promising paradigm
for developing agents that can rapidly adapt to new tasks by leveraging past
experiences as context, without updating their parameters. Recent approaches
train large sequence models on monotonic policy improvement data from online
RL, aiming to a continue improved testing time performance. However, our
experimental analysis reveals a critical flaw: these models cannot show a
continue improvement like the training data during testing time. Theoretically,
we identify this phenomenon as Contextual Ambiguity, where the model's own
stochastic actions can generate an interaction history that misleadingly
resembles that of a sub-optimal policy from the training data, initiating a
vicious cycle of poor action selection. To resolve the Contextual Ambiguity, we
introduce Context Value into training phase and propose Context Value Informed
ICRL (CV-ICRL). CV-ICRL use Context Value as an explicit signal representing
the ideal performance theoretically achievable by a policy given the current
context. As the context expands, Context Value could include more task-relevant
information, and therefore the ideal performance should be non-decreasing. We
prove that the Context Value tightens the lower bound on the performance gap
relative to an ideal, monotonically improving policy. We fruther propose two
methods for estimating Context Value at both training and testing time.
Experiments conducted on the Dark Room and Minigrid testbeds demonstrate that
CV-ICRL effectively mitigates performance degradation and improves overall ICRL
abilities across various tasks and environments. The source code and data of
this paper are available at

Method: 使用两个预训练Transformer作为密度估计器，通过一次性因果自回归方法推断每个序列的马尔可夫边界，实现并行因果发现。

Result: 在包含29,100个事件和474个标签的真实世界汽车数据集上，OSCAR在几分钟内恢复了可解释的因果结构，而经典方法无法扩展。

Conclusion: OSCAR能够在生产规模上实现实用的科学诊断，解决了大规模事件序列因果发现的扩展性问题。

Abstract: Understanding causality in event sequences with thousands of sparse event

two pretrained Transformers as density estimators. This enables efficient,
parallel causal discovery without costly global CI testing. On a real-world
automotive dataset with 29,100 events and 474 labels, OSCAR recovers
interpretable causal structures in minutes, while classical methods fail to
scale, enabling practical scientific diagnostics at production scale.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在通用数学推理上表现优异，但在专业无线通信数学问题上表现糟糕，需要精确处理信息论边界、优化约束和信号处理公式。

Method: 使用Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)和二元验证奖励进行领域特定强化学习，无需监督预热，直接从基础检查点训练模型。

Result: 7B模型在WirelessMathBench-XL基准上达到39.5%准确率，接近GPT-4o(40.4%)，参数规模比DeepSeek-R1(671B, 57.4%)小约100倍。GRPO训练使所有模型规模性能几乎翻倍。

Conclusion: 紧凑模型通过领域特定强化学习可以在专业数学任务上达到或超过大型模型性能，且具有向通用数学任务的积极迁移能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at general mathematical reasoning but fail
catastrophically on specialized technical mathematics. In wireless
communications, where problems require precise manipulation of
information-theoretic bounds, optimization constraints, and signal processing
formulations, even state-of-the-art models struggle to achieve competent
performance. We present WirelessMathLM, demonstrating that compact models
(0.5B-7B parameters) can match or exceed much larger models through
domain-specific reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards. Our key insight
is that wireless mathematics problems possess a unique property--verifiable
correctness--that enables effective reinforcement learning without human
feedback. We construct WirelessMathBench-XL, a comprehensive benchmark of 4,027
problems from 970 papers. Using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with
binary verification rewards, we train models directly from base checkpoints
without supervised warm-start. Our 7B model achieves 39.5% accuracy on
WirelessMathBench-XL, approaching GPT-4o (40.4%) while using about 100 times
fewer parameters than DeepSeek-R1 (671B, 57.4%). Remarkably, GRPO training
nearly doubles performance across all model scales (0.5B +11%, 3B +103%, 7B
+81%), with positive transfer to general mathematics benchmarks--our models
gain +8.4 points on average across MATH, Minerva-Math, OlympiadBench, AMC, and

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SPEC-RL是一个新颖的框架，将推测解码与强化学习rollout过程集成，通过重用先前的轨迹段作为推测前缀来减少计算冗余，从而加速RL训练过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的加速方法（如并行化、目标驱动修改和重放缓冲区）要么收益递减，要么引入偏差，或忽略迭代间的冗余。连续训练时期的rollout经常共享大量重叠段，浪费计算资源。

Method: SPEC-RL重用先前的轨迹段作为推测前缀，并通过草稿-验证机制扩展它们，避免冗余生成同时确保策略一致性。

Result: 在GSM8K、MATH-500、OlympiadBench、MMLU-STEM等数学推理和泛化基准测试中，SPEC-RL将rollout时间减少了2-3倍，且不影响策略质量。

Conclusion: SPEC-RL作为一种纯粹的rollout阶段增强方法，可与主流算法（如PPO、GRPO、DAPO）无缝集成，为大规模推理模型的RLVR扩展提供了通用且实用的路径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly rely on reinforcement learning with
verifiable rewards (RLVR) to elicit reliable chain-of-thought reasoning.
However, the training process remains bottlenecked by the computationally
expensive rollout stage. Existing acceleration methods-such as parallelization,
objective- and data-driven modifications, and replay buffers-either incur
diminishing returns, introduce bias, or overlook redundancy across iterations.
We identify that rollouts from consecutive training epochs frequently share a
large portion of overlapping segments, wasting computation. To address this, we
propose SPEC-RL, a novel framework that integrates SPECulative decoding with
the RL rollout process. SPEC-RL reuses prior trajectory segments as speculative
prefixes and extends them via a draft-and-verify mechanism, avoiding redundant
generation while ensuring policy consistency. Experiments on diverse math
reasoning and generalization benchmarks, including GSM8K, MATH-500,
OlympiadBench, MMLU-STEM, and others, demonstrate that SPEC-RL reduces rollout
time by 2-3x without compromising policy quality. As a purely rollout-stage
enhancement, SPEC-RL integrates seamlessly with mainstream algorithms (e.g.,
PPO, GRPO, DAPO), offering a general and practical path to scale RLVR for large
reasoning models. Our code is available at https://github.com/ShopeeLLM/Spec-RL

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界回归任务中数据分布严重偏斜，模型主要从丰富的多数样本中学习，但难以准确预测少数标签。虽然不平衡分类已被广泛研究，但不平衡回归相对较少探索。深度不平衡回归缺乏适合高维数据的专用数据级解决方案。

Method: 使用条件扩散模型结合基于优先级的生成方法，在潜在表示空间中合成高质量特征。该方法计算效率高，适用于图像、文本等多种高维数据模态。

Result: 在三个深度不平衡回归基准测试中，在少数区域取得了显著改进，同时保持了整体准确性。

Conclusion: LatentDiff填补了深度不平衡回归领域数据级解决方案的空白，为处理高维不平衡回归问题提供了有效方法。

Abstract: In many real-world regression tasks, the data distribution is heavily skewed,
and models learn predominantly from abundant majority samples while failing to
predict minority labels accurately. While imbalanced classification has been
extensively studied, imbalanced regression remains relatively unexplored. Deep
imbalanced regression (DIR) represents cases where the input data are
high-dimensional and unstructured. Although several data-level approaches for
tabular imbalanced regression exist, deep imbalanced regression currently lacks
dedicated data-level solutions suitable for high-dimensional data and relies
primarily on algorithmic modifications. To fill this gap, we propose
LatentDiff, a novel framework that uses conditional diffusion models with
priority-based generation to synthesize high-quality features in the latent
representation space. LatentDiff is computationally efficient and applicable
across diverse data modalities, including images, text, and other
high-dimensional inputs. Experiments on three DIR benchmarks demonstrate
substantial improvements in minority regions while maintaining overall
accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DPSGD方法在所有梯度步骤注入均匀噪声，导致训练时间显著延长且模型准确率下降，需要更高效的隐私保护方法

Method: ATDP自适应地为敏感和非敏感token分配不同梯度权重，在训练早期使用更大噪声尺度快速破坏敏感内容记忆，仅需少量轻量级后处理

Result: ATDP将DP微调训练时间减少约90%，达到与最先进DP-SGD方法相当的隐私保护水平，且准确率下降最小

Conclusion: ATDP提供了一种高效隐私保护方案，可无缝集成到现有DP微调流程中，显著降低计算开销同时保持模型性能

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) frequently memorize sensitive or personal
information, raising significant privacy concerns. Existing variants of
differential privacy stochastic gradient descent (DPSGD) inject uniform noise
into every gradient step, significantly extending training time and reducing
model accuracy. We propose that concentrating noise primarily on gradients
associated with sensitive tokens can substantially decrease DP training time,
strengthen the protection of sensitive information, and simultaneously preserve
the model's performance on non-sensitive data. We operationalize this insight
through Adaptive Token-Weighted Differential Privacy (ATDP), a modification of
vanilla DP-SGD that adaptively assigns different gradient weights to sensitive
and non-sensitive tokens. By employing a larger noise scale at the early stage
of training, ATDP rapidly disrupts memorization of sensitive content. As a
result, ATDP only requires a few additional epochs of lightweight
post-processing following standard fine-tuning, injecting targeted noise
primarily on parameters corresponding to sensitive tokens, thus minimally
affecting the model's general capabilities. ATDP can be seamlessly integrated
into any existing DP-based fine-tuning pipeline or directly applied to
non-private models as a fast privacy-enhancing measure. Additionally, combined
with an initial redacted fine-tuning phase, ATDP forms a streamlined DP
pipeline that achieves comparable canary protection to state-of-the-art DP-SGD
methods, significantly reduces the computational overhead of DP fine-tuning,
shortening training time by approximately 90 percent, while achieving
comparable or superior privacy protection and minimal accuracy degradation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于线性子空间的降阶建模方法在处理高维参数空间时，经典插值策略变得不可行或不可靠，需要更有效的参数化子空间近似方法。

Method: 将插值问题松弛为回归问题，引入适合子空间数据的损失函数，使用神经网络作为高维目标函数的近似，并通过预测更大维度的子空间来简化学习问题。

Result: 理论分析表明该方法降低了椭圆特征问题的映射复杂度，使Grassmann流形上的光滑映射更平滑，实验结果显示预测更大子空间能显著提高精度。

Conclusion: 子空间回归方法在参数化特征问题、紧缩技术、松弛方法、最优控制和参数化偏微分方程求解等任务中具有实用价值。

Abstract: It is often possible to perform reduced order modelling by specifying linear
subspace which accurately captures the dynamics of the system. This approach
becomes especially appealing when linear subspace explicitly depends on
parameters of the problem. A practical way to apply such a scheme is to compute
subspaces for a selected set of parameters in the computationally demanding
offline stage and in the online stage approximate subspace for unknown
parameters by interpolation. For realistic problems the space of parameters is
high dimensional, which renders classical interpolation strategies infeasible
or unreliable. We propose to relax the interpolation problem to regression,
introduce several loss functions suitable for subspace data, and use a neural
network as an approximation to high-dimensional target function. To further
simplify a learning problem we introduce redundancy: in place of predicting
subspace of a given dimension we predict larger subspace. We show theoretically
that this strategy decreases the complexity of the mapping for elliptic
eigenproblems with constant coefficients and makes the mapping smoother for
general smooth function on the Grassmann manifold. Empirical results also show
that accuracy significantly improves when larger-than-needed subspaces are
predicted. With the set of numerical illustrations we demonstrate that subspace
regression can be useful for a range of tasks including parametric
eigenproblems, deflation techniques, relaxation methods, optimal control and
solution of parametric partial differential equations.

synthesizing multi-step questions with explanatory annotations that target
specific reasoning capabilities. Fine-tuning a 4B-parameter model on
NanoFlux-generated data yields performance gains across diverse domains
compared to full-benchmark fine-tuning: +5.9% on mathematical reasoning
(GSMHard), +3.6% on scientific reasoning (GenomeBench), and +16.6% on medical
reasoning (MultiMedQA), while reducing computational requirements by 3-14x.
Ablation studies reveal a non-monotonic relationship between dataset
characteristics and model performance, uncovering domain-specific optimal
points for question complexity and reasoning quality. NanoFlux automates
training data generation through embedding-based novelty filtering,
tool-augmented evaluation, and multi-hop reasoning, suggesting that future

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ABCONFORMER是一个基于Conformer架构的模型，能够仅从序列准确预测抗体-抗原界面，包括互补位、表位和泛表位预测，在SARS-CoV-2数据集上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确预测抗体-抗原界面对于疫苗设计、免疫诊断和治疗性抗体开发至关重要，但目前仅从序列进行可靠预测仍然具有挑战性。

Method: 基于Conformer骨干网络，引入物理启发的滑动注意力机制，能够在不依赖三维结构数据的情况下恢复残基级接触。

Result: 在SARS-CoV-2抗体-抗原数据集上达到最先进性能，超越了广泛使用的基于序列的抗体无关表位预测方法。消融研究显示滑动注意力相比传统交叉注意力显著提高了表位预测精度。

Conclusion: ABCONFORMER能够仅从序列准确预测抗体-抗原相互作用，为疫苗和治疗性抗体开发提供了有效的计算工具。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of antibody-antigen (Ab-Ag) interfaces is critical for
vaccine design, immunodiagnostics, and therapeutic antibody development.
However, achieving reliable predictions from sequences alone remains a
challenge. In this paper, we present ABCONFORMER, a model based on the
Conformer backbone that captures both local and global features of a
biosequence. To accurately capture Ab-Ag interactions, we introduced the
physics-inspired sliding attention, enabling residue-level contact recovery
without relying on three-dimensional structural data. ABConformer can
accurately predict paratopes and epitopes given the antibody and antigen
sequence, and predict pan-epitopes on the antigen without antibody information.
In comparison experiments, ABCONFORMER achieves state-of-the-art performance on
a recent SARS-CoV-2 Ab-Ag dataset, and surpasses widely used sequence-based
methods for antibody-agnostic epitope prediction. Ablation studies further
quantify the contribution of each component, demonstrating that, compared to
conventional cross-attention, sliding attention significantly enhances the
precision of epitope prediction. To facilitate reproducibility, we will release
the code under an open-source license upon acceptance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的扩散模型推理时控制方法主要依赖启发式引导或与SMC结合进行偏差校正，需要更灵活高效的替代方案

Method: 基于副本交换算法开发CREPE方法，通过并行运行多个副本并进行交换来实现控制，支持序列生成和在线优化

Result: 在温度退火、奖励倾斜、模型组合和分类器自由引导去偏等多个任务中表现出与SMC方法相当的竞争力

Conclusion: CREPE为扩散模型推理时控制提供了灵活高效的替代方案，具有序列生成、样本多样性保持和在线优化等优势

Abstract: Inference-time control of diffusion models aims to steer model outputs to
satisfy new constraints without retraining. Previous approaches have mostly
relied on heuristic guidance or have been coupled with Sequential Monte Carlo
(SMC) for bias correction. In this paper, we propose a flexible alternative
based on replica exchange, an algorithm designed initially for sampling
problems. We refer to this method as the CREPE (Controlling with REPlica
Exchange). Unlike SMC, CREPE: (1) generates particles sequentially, (2)
maintains high diversity in the generated samples after a burn-in period, and
(3) enables online refinement or early termination. We demonstrate its
versatility across various tasks, including temperature annealing,
reward-tilting, model composition and classifier-free guidance debiasing, with
competitive performance compared to prior SMC methods.

TL;DR: 该研究比较了三种机器学习方法（从头机器学习、迁移学习和集成整合）在乳腺癌生存预后预测中的表现，发现这些方法在PREDICT v3工具信息缺失或数据集偏移的情况下能改善预后预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基因组预后工具成本高且可及性有限，而临床病理预后更经济易得。机器学习、迁移学习和集成整合为构建稳健的预后框架提供了机会。

Method: 使用MA.27试验数据进行模型训练，在TEAM试验和SEER队列中进行外部验证。方法包括：迁移学习（微调PREDICT v3）、从头机器学习（随机生存森林和极端梯度提升）、集成整合（模型预测的加权求和）。

Result: 迁移学习、从头RSF和集成整合在MA.27中改善了校准（ICI从0.042降至≤0.007），判别能力保持相当（AUC从0.738提升至0.744-0.799）。ML模型能处理PREDICT v3无法预测的23.8-25.8%病例。年龄、淋巴结状态、病理分级和肿瘤大小是最重要的预后因素。

Conclusion: 在PREDICT v3相关信息缺失或可能存在数据集偏移的情况下，迁移学习、从头RSF和集成整合能够改善乳腺癌的预后预测。

Abstract: Prognostic information is essential for decision-making in breast cancer
management. Recently trials have predominantly focused on genomic
prognostication tools, even though clinicopathological prognostication is less
costly and more widely accessible. Machine learning (ML), transfer learning and
ensemble integration offer opportunities to build robust prognostication
frameworks. We evaluate this potential to improve survival prognostication in
breast cancer by comparing de-novo ML, transfer learning from a pre-trained
prognostic tool and ensemble integration. Data from the MA.27 trial was used
for model training, with external validation on the TEAM trial and a SEER
cohort. Transfer learning was applied by fine-tuning the pre-trained prognostic
tool PREDICT v3, de-novo ML included Random Survival Forests and Extreme
Gradient Boosting, and ensemble integration was realized through a weighted sum
of model predictions. Transfer learning, de-novo RSF, and ensemble integration
improved calibration in MA.27 over the pre-trained model (ICI reduced from
0.042 in PREDICT v3 to <=0.007) while discrimination remained comparable (AUC
increased from 0.738 in PREDICT v3 to 0.744-0.799). Invalid PREDICT v3
predictions were observed in 23.8-25.8% of MA.27 individuals due to missing
information. In contrast, ML models and ensemble integration could predict
survival regardless of missing information. Across all models, patient age,
nodal status, pathological grading and tumor size had the highest SHAP values,
indicating their importance for survival prognostication. External validation
in SEER, but not in TEAM, confirmed the benefits of transfer learning, RSF and
ensemble integration. This study demonstrates that transfer learning, de-novo
RSF, and ensemble integration can improve prognostication in situations where
relevant information for PREDICT v3 is lacking or where a dataset shift is
likely.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于连续时间强化学习的资产负债管理新方法，使用线性二次型框架结合中期和最终目标，通过模型无关的策略梯度算法实现资产与负债的动态同步。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统资产负债管理方法在处理动态资产与负债同步方面存在局限，需要开发更有效的优化策略来平衡中期和最终目标。

Method: 采用模型无关的软演员-评论家算法，结合自适应探索（演员）和计划探索（评论家），在线性二次型框架下进行连续时间强化学习。

Result: 在200个随机市场情景中测试，该方法在所有替代策略中获得了更高的平均奖励，具有快速初始收益和持续优越性能。

Conclusion: 该方法优于传统金融策略和现有强化学习算法，其优势源于直接学习最优ALM策略而非学习环境模型，无需复杂神经网络或改进参数估计。

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel approach for Asset-Liability Management (ALM) by
employing continuous-time Reinforcement Learning (RL) with a linear-quadratic
(LQ) formulation that incorporates both interim and terminal objectives. We
develop a model-free, policy gradient-based soft actor-critic algorithm
tailored to ALM for dynamically synchronizing assets and liabilities. To ensure
an effective balance between exploration and exploitation with minimal tuning,
we introduce adaptive exploration for the actor and scheduled exploration for
the critic. Our empirical study evaluates this approach against two enhanced
traditional financial strategies, a model-based continuous-time RL method, and
three state-of-the-art RL algorithms. Evaluated across 200 randomized market
scenarios, our method achieves higher average rewards than all alternative
strategies, with rapid initial gains and sustained superior performance. The
outperformance stems not from complex neural networks or improved parameter
estimation, but from directly learning the optimal ALM strategy without
learning the environment.

Abstract: Accurate aircraft trajectory prediction is critical for air traffic
management, airline operations, and environmental assessment. This paper
introduces NODE-FDM, a Neural Ordinary Differential Equations-based Flight
Dynamics Model trained on Quick Access Recorder (QAR) data. By combining
analytical kinematic relations with data-driven components, NODE-FDM achieves a
more accurate reproduction of recorded trajectories than state-of-the-art
models such as a BADA-based trajectory generation methodology (BADA4
performance model combined with trajectory control routines), particularly in
the descent phase of the flight. The analysis demonstrates marked improvements
across altitude, speed, and mass dynamics. Despite current limitations,
including limited physical constraints and the limited availability of QAR
data, the results demonstrate the potential of physics-informed neural ordinary
differential equations as a high-fidelity, data-driven approach to aircraft
performance modelling. Future work will extend the framework to incorporate a
full modelling of the lateral dynamics of the aircraft.

Method: ASTGI框架包含四个模块：时空点表示模块将离散观测编码为可学习嵌入空间中的点；邻域自适应图构建模块通过最近邻搜索为每个点自适应构建因果图；时空动态传播模块基于点间相对时空位置生成消息并计算交互权重，迭代更新自适应因果图上的信息；查询点预测模块通过聚合邻域信息对新查询点进行回归预测。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，ASTGI优于各种最先进的方法。

Conclusion: ASTGI框架有效解决了不规则多元时间序列预测中的关键挑战，通过自适应时空图交互机制实现了更准确的预测性能。

Abstract: Irregular multivariate time series (IMTS) are prevalent in critical domains
like healthcare and finance, where accurate forecasting is vital for proactive
decision-making. However, the asynchronous sampling and irregular intervals
inherent to IMTS pose two core challenges for existing methods: (1) how to
accurately represent the raw information of irregular time series without
introducing data distortion, and (2) how to effectively capture the complex
dynamic dependencies between observation points. To address these challenges,
we propose the Adaptive Spatio-Temporal Graph Interaction (ASTGI) framework.
Specifically, the framework first employs a Spatio-Temporal Point
Representation module to encode each discrete observation as a point within a
learnable spatio-temporal embedding space. Second, a Neighborhood-Adaptive
Graph Construction module adaptively builds a causal graph for each point in
the embedding space via nearest neighbor search. Subsequently, a
Spatio-Temporal Dynamic Propagation module iteratively updates information on
these adaptive causal graphs by generating messages and computing interaction
weights based on the relative spatio-temporal positions between points.
Finally, a Query Point-based Prediction module generates the final forecast by
aggregating neighborhood information for a new query point and performing
regression. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate
that ASTGI outperforms various state-of-the-art methods.

Method: 分析迭代状态的几何特性，提出两尺度操作模型，并基于二阶差分开发早期退出机制。

Result: 测量显示循环步骤变得更小且更正交，表明对精细结构的局部建模改善。基于二阶差分的退出机制在性能、稳定性和时间效率上优于KL散度和一阶方法。

Conclusion: 循环深度transformer的迭代状态呈现两尺度动态特性，基于二阶差分的早期退出机制是有效的优化策略。

Abstract: Recurrent-depth transformers scale test-time compute by iterating latent
computations before emitting tokens. We study the geometry of these iterates
and argue for a simple, \emph{two-scale} operational picture: (i) within a
looped block, updates act as \emph{small-scale refinements}; (ii) across
consecutive blocks, states undergo a \emph{larger-scale drift}. Across
checkpoints, our measurements show that loop steps become \emph{smaller} and
increasingly \emph{orthogonal} to one another, indicating better local modeling
of fine structure rather than merely pushing in a single direction. These
dynamics motivate an early-exit mechanism based on the model's second-order
difference in step-size, which we show is superior in terms of performance,
stability and time-efficiency, when compared to the KL-divergence exit strategy
of Geiping et al. and its naive first-order counterpart.

Abstract: Regression is essential across many domains but remains challenging in
high-dimensional settings, where existing methods often lose spatial structure
or demand heavy storage. In this work, we address the problem of matrix-valued
regression, where each sample is naturally represented as a matrix. We propose
MELCOT, a hybrid model that integrates a classical machine learning-based
Marginal Estimation (ME) block with a deep learning-based Learnable-Cost
Optimal Transport (LCOT) block. The ME block estimates data marginals to
preserve spatial information, while the LCOT block learns complex global
features. This design enables MELCOT to inherit the strengths of both classical
and deep learning methods. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets and
domains demonstrate that MELCOT consistently outperforms all baselines while
remaining highly efficient.

Result: 在匹配真实世界复杂度的合成数据集上验证了有效性，成功发现了LLM激活中有意义的概念关系。

Conclusion: 同时建模时间和瞬时概念关系能够显著提升LLMs的可解释性。

Abstract: Despite Large Language Models' remarkable capabilities, understanding their
internal representations remains challenging. Mechanistic interpretability
tools such as sparse autoencoders (SAEs) were developed to extract
interpretable features from LLMs but lack temporal dependency modeling,
instantaneous relation representation, and more importantly theoretical
guarantees, undermining both the theoretical foundations and the practical
confidence necessary for subsequent analyses. While causal representation
learning (CRL) offers theoretically grounded approaches for uncovering latent
concepts, existing methods cannot scale to LLMs' rich conceptual space due to
inefficient computation. To bridge the gap, we introduce an identifiable
temporal causal representation learning framework specifically designed for
LLMs' high-dimensional concept space, capturing both time-delayed and
instantaneous causal relations. Our approach provides theoretical guarantees
and demonstrates efficacy on synthetic datasets scaled to match real-world
complexity. By extending SAE techniques with our temporal causal framework, we
successfully discover meaningful concept relationships in LLM activations. Our
findings show that modeling both temporal and instantaneous conceptual
relationships advances the interpretability of LLMs.

Result: 实验表明，使用鲁棒目标直接微调非鲁棒模型会导致次优迁移，在挑战性场景下甚至可能出现迁移失败。而Epsilon-Scheduling方法能有效防止次优迁移，并持续提升预期鲁棒性。

Conclusion: Epsilon-Scheduling方法成功解决了从非鲁棒预训练模型进行鲁棒微调时的次优迁移问题，为同时实现下游任务适应性和对抗鲁棒性提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Fine-tuning pretrained models is a standard and effective workflow in modern
machine learning. However, robust fine-tuning (RFT), which aims to
simultaneously achieve adaptation to a downstream task and robustness to
adversarial examples, remains challenging. Despite the abundance of non-robust
pretrained models in open-source repositories, their potential for RFT is less
understood. We address this knowledge gap by systematically examining RFT from
such non-robust models. Our experiments reveal that fine-tuning non-robust
models with a robust objective, even under small perturbations, can lead to
poor performance, a phenomenon that we dub \emph{suboptimal transfer}. In
challenging scenarios (eg, difficult tasks, high perturbation), the resulting
performance can be so low that it may be considered a transfer failure. We find
that fine-tuning using a robust objective impedes task adaptation at the
beginning of training and eventually prevents optimal transfer. However, we
propose a novel heuristic, \emph{Epsilon-Scheduling}, a schedule over
perturbation strength used during training that promotes optimal transfer.
Additionally, we introduce \emph{expected robustness}, a metric that captures
performance across a range of perturbations, providing a more comprehensive
evaluation of the accuracy-robustness trade-off for diverse models at test
time. Extensive experiments on a wide range of configurations (six pretrained
models and five datasets) show that \emph{Epsilon-Scheduling} successfully
prevents \emph{suboptimal transfer} and consistently improves expected
robustness.

Abstract: The Entropic Optimal Transport (EOT) problem and its dynamic counterpart, the
Schr\"odinger bridge (SB) problem, play an important role in modern machine
learning, linking generative modeling with optimal transport theory. While
recent advances in discrete diffusion and flow models have sparked growing
interest in applying SB methods to discrete domains, there is still no reliable
way to evaluate how well these methods actually solve the underlying problem.
We address this challenge by introducing a benchmark for SB on discrete spaces.
Our construction yields pairs of probability distributions with analytically
known SB solutions, enabling rigorous evaluation. As a byproduct of building
this benchmark, we obtain two new SB algorithms, DLightSB and DLightSB-M, and
additionally extend prior related work to construct the $\alpha$-CSBM
algorithm. We demonstrate the utility of our benchmark by evaluating both
existing and new solvers in high-dimensional discrete settings. This work
provides the first step toward proper evaluation of SB methods on discrete
spaces, paving the way for more reproducible future studies.

Conclusion: 该方法在数据驱动控制的有限时域参考跟踪任务中表现出有效性，展示了在实用生成和设计应用中的潜力。

Abstract: Under the data manifold hypothesis, high-dimensional data are concentrated
near a low-dimensional manifold. We study the problem of Riemannian
optimization over such manifolds when they are given only implicitly through
the data distribution, and the standard manifold operations required by
classical algorithms are unavailable. This formulation captures a broad class
of data-driven design problems that are central to modern generative AI. Our
key idea is to introduce a link function that connects the data distribution to
the geometric operations needed for optimization. We show that this function
enables the recovery of essential manifold operations, such as retraction and
Riemannian gradient computation. Moreover, we establish a direct connection
between our construction and the score function in diffusion models of the data
distribution. This connection allows us to leverage well-studied
parameterizations, efficient training procedures, and even pretrained score
networks from the diffusion model literature to perform optimization. Building
on this foundation, we propose two efficient inference-time algorithms --
Denoising Landing Flow (DLF) and Denoising Riemannian Gradient Descent (DRGD)
-- and provide theoretical guarantees for both feasibility (approximate
manifold adherence) and optimality (small Riemannian gradient norm). Finally,
we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on finite-horizon reference
tracking tasks in data-driven control, highlighting its potential for practical
generative and design applications.

TL;DR: 本文通过理论分析揭示了连续思维链（continuous CoT）在训练过程中如何自然学习叠加机制，特别是在有向图可达性问题上的训练动态。

Motivation: 虽然先前工作表明连续CoT通过隐式并行思维提升LLMs推理能力，并有理论证明两层transformer通过叠加机制能高效解决有向图可达性问题，但叠加机制如何从基于梯度的训练方法中自然学习仍不清楚。

Method: 理论分析简化两层transformer在有向图可达性问题上的训练动态，包含两个训练阶段：思维生成阶段（自回归扩展连续思维）和预测阶段（将思维转换为最终答案）。

Result: 分析发现训练过程中索引匹配logit先增加后保持有界，这有效平衡推理过程中的探索与利用，导致模型在不确定正确解时对多个搜索轨迹分配可比较权重，从而产生叠加。实验验证了logit增长理论。

Conclusion: 连续思维训练自然诱导叠加机制，通过平衡探索与利用实现高效推理，为理解CoT工作机制提供了理论洞见。

Abstract: Previous work shows that the chain of continuous thought (continuous CoT)
improves the reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs) by enabling
implicit parallel thinking, and a subsequent work provided theoretical insight
by showing that a two-layer transformer equipped with continuous CoT can
efficiently solve directed graph reachability by maintaining a superposition of
multiple reasoning traces in the continuous thought. However, it remains
unclear how the superposition mechanism is naturally learned from
gradient-based training methods. To fill this gap, we theoretically analyze the
training dynamics of a simplified two-layer transformer on the directed graph
reachability problem to unveil how the superposition mechanism emerges during
training in two training stages -- (i) a thought-generation stage that
autoregressively expands the continuous thought, and (ii) a prediction stage
that converts the thought into the final answer. Our analysis reveals that
during training using continuous thought, the index-matching logit, an
important quantity which reflects the strength of the model's local search
ability, will first increase and then remain bounded under mild assumptions.
The bounded index-matching logit effectively balances exploration and
exploitation during the reasoning process: the model will exploit local problem
structures to identify plausible search traces, and assign comparable weights
to multiple such traces to explore when it is uncertain about which solution is
correct, which results in superposition. Our experimental results tracking the
growth of logits further validate our theory.

Result: KAN-based选择器在结构化数据集和合成数据集中与经典基线方法竞争，有时更优。KAN-L2和KAN-SI在噪声回归数据集和异构数据集上表现稳健，与集成预测器性能接近。在分类任务中，KAN选择器有时通过消除冗余特征而超越其他方法。

Conclusion: KAN-based特征选择为传统方法提供了强大且可解释的替代方案，能够发现超越稀疏性或基于不纯度度量的非线性和多变量特征相关性。

Abstract: High-dimensional datasets require effective feature selection to improve
predictive performance, interpretability, and robustness. We propose and
evaluate feature selection methods for tabular datasets based on
Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KANs), which parameterize feature transformations
through splines, enabling direct access to interpretable importance measures.
We introduce four KAN-based selectors ($\textit{KAN-L1}$, $\textit{KAN-L2}$,
$\textit{KAN-SI}$, $\textit{KAN-KO}$) and compare them against classical
baselines (LASSO, Random Forest, Mutual Information, SVM-RFE) across multiple
classification and regression tabular dataset benchmarks. Average (over three
retention levels: 20\%, 40\%, and 60\%) F1 scores and $R^2$ score results
reveal that KAN-based selectors, particularly $\textit{KAN-L2}$,
$\textit{KAN-L1}$, $\textit{KAN-SI}$, and $\textit{KAN-KO}$, are competitive
with and sometimes superior to classical baselines in structured and synthetic
datasets. However, $\textit{KAN-L1}$ is often too aggressive in regression,
removing useful features, while $\textit{KAN-L2}$ underperforms in
classification, where simple coefficient shrinkage misses complex feature
interactions. $\textit{KAN-L2}$ and $\textit{KAN-SI}$ provide robust
performance on noisy regression datasets and heterogeneous datasets, aligning
closely with ensemble predictors. In classification tasks, KAN selectors such
as $\textit{KAN-L1}$, $\textit{KAN-KO}$, and $\textit{KAN-SI}$ sometimes
surpass the other selectors by eliminating redundancy, particularly in
high-dimensional multi-class data. Overall, our findings demonstrate that
KAN-based feature selection provides a powerful and interpretable alternative
to traditional methods, capable of uncovering nonlinear and multivariate
feature relevance beyond sparsity or impurity-based measures.

TL;DR: 提出图一致性正则化(GCR)框架，通过将模型预测衍生的关系图结构注入学习过程，促进类感知的语义特征表示，作为自提示机制让模型利用自身输出来优化内部结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度网络学习到的丰富表示往往捕获了与模型预测语义相矛盾的噪声类间相似性，需要解决特征级关系与类一致预测行为之间的不一致问题。

Method: 在任意深度引入参数自由的图一致性层(GCL)，构建批次级特征相似图并与全局类感知掩码预测图对齐，通过多层跨空间图对齐机制和自适应权重学习层重要性。

Result: GCR在各种网络和数据集上促进更清晰的特征结构、更强的类内凝聚力和改进的泛化能力，无需修改架构或训练过程。

Conclusion: GCR提供了一种从预测结构学习的新视角，是模型无关、轻量级的框架，能有效增强语义结构质量。

Abstract: We propose Graph Consistency Regularization (GCR), a novel framework that
injects relational graph structures, derived from model predictions, into the
learning process to promote class-aware, semantically meaningful feature
representations. Functioning as a form of self-prompting, GCR enables the model
to refine its internal structure using its own outputs. While deep networks
learn rich representations, these often capture noisy inter-class similarities
that contradict the model's predicted semantics. GCR addresses this issue by
introducing parameter-free Graph Consistency Layers (GCLs) at arbitrary depths.
Each GCL builds a batch-level feature similarity graph and aligns it with a
global, class-aware masked prediction graph, derived by modulating softmax
prediction similarities with intra-class indicators. This alignment enforces
that feature-level relationships reflect class-consistent prediction behavior,
acting as a semantic regularizer throughout the network. Unlike prior work, GCR
introduces a multi-layer, cross-space graph alignment mechanism with adaptive
weighting, where layer importance is learned from graph discrepancy magnitudes.
This allows the model to prioritize semantically reliable layers and suppress
noisy ones, enhancing feature quality without modifying the architecture or
training procedure. GCR is model-agnostic, lightweight, and improves semantic
structure across various networks and datasets. Experiments show that GCR
promotes cleaner feature structure, stronger intra-class cohesion, and improved
generalization, offering a new perspective on learning from prediction
structure. [Project website](https://darcyddx.github.io/gcr/)

TL;DR: 本文提出Planner Aware Path Learning (PAPL)方法，通过改进离散扩散模型的训练目标来解决规划采样策略导致的训练-推理不匹配问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散语言模型通过灵活的并行生成路径实现快速推理，但规划采样策略修改了反向路径，导致训练时的均匀随机去噪路径与推理时的规划路径不匹配。

Method: 推导了新的Planned Evidence Lower Bound (P-ELBO)，将基于规划器的反向动态直接纳入训练目标，提出了PAPL方法改进标准掩码离散扩散损失。

Result: PAPL在多个领域带来一致改进：蛋白质序列建模相对提升40%，文本生成MAUVE指标提升高达4倍，代码生成HumanEval pass@10相对提升23%。

Conclusion: PAPL通过将规划器感知路径学习纳入训练目标，有效解决了扩散模型中训练-推理不匹配问题，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Diffusion language models have emerged as a powerful alternative to
autoregressive models, enabling fast inference through flexible and parallel
generation paths. This flexibility is enabled by new sampling strategies, or
planners, that iteratively choose where to denoise along the sequence rather
than sampling uniformly at random. However, by modifying reverse paths,
planners introduce a mismatch between the uniformly random denoising paths used
during training and the planning-based paths used at inference. In this work,
we systematically investigate this mismatch and theoretically show that the
standard discrete diffusion training evidence lower bound (ELBO) does not
accurately describe a denoiser under non-uniform planning. To bridge this gap,
we derive a new Planned Evidence Lower Bound (P-ELBO) that directly
incorporates planner-based reverse dynamics into the training objective.
Building on this, we propose Planner Aware Path Learning (PAPL), a simple and
effective modification of the standard masked discrete diffusion loss that
aligns training and inference under planned denoisers. Empirically, PAPL
delivers consistent improvements across domains, including a 40% relative gain
in protein sequence modeling, up to a 4x improvement in MAUVE for text
generation, and a 23% relative gain in HumanEval pass@10 for code generation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于多视图边缘分类的多重图链接预测框架，使用跨层自注意力融合不同层的证据，并引入了可扩展的候选池和无泄漏协议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么压缩层信息，要么独立处理各层，导致丢失关键的层间依赖关系且难以扩展。

Method: 将多重链接预测构建为多视图边缘分类，为每个节点对构建每层边缘视图序列，应用跨层自注意力融合目标层的证据。提出了Trans-SLE和Trans-GAT两个模型实例。

Result: 在六个公共多重数据集上的实验显示，相比强基线方法（MELL、HOPLP-MUL、RMNE）获得了持续的macro-F1提升。

Conclusion: 该方法简单、可扩展，且兼容预计算嵌入和GNN编码器，能有效处理多重图中的层间依赖关系。

Abstract: Multiplex graphs capture diverse relations among shared nodes. Most
predictors either collapse layers or treat them independently. This loses
crucial inter-layer dependencies and struggles with scalability. To overcome
this, we frame multiplex link prediction as multi-view edge classification. For
each node pair, we construct a sequence of per-layer edge views and apply
cross-layer self-attention to fuse evidence for the target layer. We present
two models as instances of this framework: Trans-SLE, a lightweight transformer
over static embeddings, and Trans-GAT, which combines layer-specific GAT
encoders with transformer fusion. To ensure scalability and fairness, we
introduce a Union--Set candidate pool and two leakage-free protocols:
cross-layer and inductive subgraph generalization. Experiments on six public
multiplex datasets show consistent macro-F_1 gains over strong baselines (MELL,
HOPLP-MUL, RMNE). Our approach is simple, scalable, and compatible with both
precomputed embeddings and GNN encoders.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PATCH是一种混合稀疏框架，通过在权重矩阵中划分区块并学习选择密集或2:4稀疏模式，实现了0%-50%连续稀疏比，在保持准确性的同时获得实际加速效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有剪枝方法面临两难：非结构化稀疏保持准确性但无法GPU加速，而半结构化2:4稀疏硬件友好但强制50%模式会降低模型质量。需要一种能平衡准确性和加速的灵活稀疏方法。

Method: 将权重矩阵划分为区块，通过可学习的掩码选择机制为每个区块分配密集或2:4稀疏模式，支持跨层非均匀稀疏分布和连续稀疏比控制。

Result: 在0.5B到8B参数模型上，PATCH持续缩小与密集模型的准确性差距，在LLaMA-2 7B上实现1.18x-1.38x端到端加速，相比最先进的2:4剪枝方法MaskLLM准确性提升0.37%-2.96%。

Conclusion: PATCH框架成功平衡了模型准确性和硬件加速需求，通过混合稀疏设计实现了连续稀疏比控制和跨层非均匀稀疏，在多种规模模型上都表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) deliver impressive performance but incur
prohibitive memory and compute costs at deployment. Model pruning is an
effective way to reduce these overheads, yet existing approaches face
challenges: unstructured sparsity, where nonzeros can appear anywhere,
preserves accuracy but yields irregular access patterns that prevent GPU
acceleration, while semi-structured 2:4 sparsity is hardware-friendly but
enforces a rigid 50% pattern that degrades model quality. To bridge this gap,
we introduce PATCH, a hybrid sparsity framework that enables a continuous
sparsity ratio between 0% and 50%. PATCH partitions weight matrices into tiles,
assigning each tile to be either dense or 2:4 sparse via a learnable mask
selection mechanism. This design provides fine-grained control over
accuracy-acceleration tradeoffs and supports non-uniform sparsity across
layers, leading to superior overall quality. Across models from 0.5B to 8B
parameters, PATCH consistently narrows the gap to dense accuracy while
delivering practical speedups. For instance, on LLaMA-2 7B with an A6000 GPU,
PATCH achieves 1.18x-1.38x end-to-end speedup over dense baselines while
improving accuracy by 0.37%-2.96% compared to the state-of-the-art 2:4 pruning
method, MaskLLM.

TL;DR: URS是一个统一的神经路由求解器，能够在零样本情况下泛化到100多种车辆路径问题变体，无需微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经求解器依赖预定义约束或需要逐问题微调，限制了零样本泛化能力。

Method: 提出统一数据表示(UDR)、混合偏置模块(MBM)、参数生成器和LLM驱动的约束满足机制。

Result: URS能够在零样本情况下为100多种VRP变体（包括90多种未见变体）生成高质量解。

Conclusion: URS是首个能够用单一模型处理100多种VRP变体的神经求解器，具有强大的零样本泛化能力。

Abstract: Multi-task neural routing solvers have emerged as a promising paradigm for
their ability to solve multiple vehicle routing problems (VRPs) using a single
model. However, existing neural solvers typically rely on predefined problem
constraints or require per-problem fine-tuning, which substantially limits
their zero-shot generalization ability to unseen VRP variants. To address this
critical bottleneck, we propose URS, a unified neural routing solver capable of
zero-shot generalization across a wide range of unseen VRPs using a single
model without any fine-tuning. The key component of URS is the unified data
representation (UDR), which replaces problem enumeration with data unification,
thereby broadening the problem coverage and reducing reliance on domain
expertise. In addition, we propose a Mixed Bias Module (MBM) to efficiently
learn the geometric and relational biases inherent in various problems. On top
of the proposed UDR, we further develop a parameter generator that adaptively
adjusts the decoder and bias weights of MBM to enhance zero-shot
generalization. Moreover, we propose an LLM-driven constraint satisfaction
mechanism, which translates raw problem descriptions into executable stepwise
masking functions to ensure solution feasibility. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that URS can consistently produce high-quality solutions for more
than 100 distinct VRP variants without any fine-tuning, which includes more
than 90 unseen variants. To the best of our knowledge, URS is the first neural
solver capable of handling over 100 VRP variants with a single model.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LOTFormer是一种同时具备线性时间复杂度和双重随机性的注意力机制，通过将注意力映射重新表述为查询和键之间的运输计划，并使用低秩约束来提高效率和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准softmax注意力机制存在二次复杂度问题，限制了其在长上下文窗口中的扩展性。同时，大多数注意力机制（包括线性和二次）会产生行归一化的映射，可能导致过度关注少数token，降低鲁棒性和信息流。

Method: 利用注意力映射与查询和键之间运输计划的联系，通过将运输计划约束为低秩（使用具有小支撑的可学习枢轴度量），解决两个熵最优运输问题（查询→枢轴和枢轴→键），并将它们组合成条件耦合。

Result: 在Long Range Arena基准测试中达到最先进的结果，在准确性和效率方面均优于先前的线性和基于运输的注意力方法。

Conclusion: LOTFormer提供了一种原则性的方法，同时实现了线性时间复杂度和双重随机性，解决了标准注意力机制的可扩展性和鲁棒性问题。

Abstract: Transformers have proven highly effective across a wide range of modalities.
However, the quadratic complexity of the standard softmax attention mechanism
poses a fundamental barrier to scaling them to long context windows. A large
body of work addresses this with linear attention, which reformulates attention
as a kernel function and approximates it with finite feature maps to achieve
linear-time computation. Orthogonal to computational scaling, most attention
mechanisms -- both quadratic and linear -- produce row-normalized maps that can
over-focus on a few tokens, degrading robustness and information flow.
Enforcing doubly-stochastic attention alleviates this by balancing token
participation across rows and columns, but existing doubly-stochastic attention
mechanisms typically introduce substantial overhead, undermining scalability.
We propose LOTFormer, a principled attention mechanism that is simultaneously
linear-time and doubly-stochastic. Our approach exploits the connection between
attention maps and transportation plans between query and key measures. The
central idea is to constrain the transport plan to be low-rank by conditioning
it on a learnable pivot measure with small support. Concretely, we solve two
entropic optimal transport problems (queries $\to$ pivot and pivot $\to$ keys)
and compose them into a conditional (glued) coupling. This yields an attention
matrix that is provably doubly-stochastic, has rank at most $r \ll n$, and
applies to values in $O(nr)$ time without forming the full $n \times n$ map.
The pivot locations and masses are learned end-to-end. Empirically, LOTFormer
achieves state-of-the-art results on the Long Range Arena benchmark, surpassing
prior linear and transport-based attention methods in both accuracy and
efficiency.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了Hessian矩阵近似质量对影响函数数据归因性能的影响，发现在分类任务中更好的Hessian近似能产生更准确的影响分数，并分解了不同近似步骤对归因准确性的贡献。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 影响函数需要计算大而病态的Hessian矩阵的逆，现有近似方法如GGN和K-FAC虽然使计算可行，但尚不清楚这些近似对数据归因性能的具体影响，以及更好的Hessian近似是否必然带来更好的归因效果。

Method: 在受控分类设置中研究Hessian近似质量对影响函数归因的影响，分解近期Hessian近似方法的各个步骤，并评估每个步骤对归因准确性的影响。

Result: 实验表明更好的Hessian近似一致地产生更好的影响分数质量，K-FAC特征值与GGN/EK-FAC特征值之间的不匹配是误差和影响损失的主要来源。

Conclusion: 这些发现强调了哪些近似最为关键，为未来在计算可行性和归因准确性之间寻求平衡提供了指导。

Abstract: Influence functions offer a principled way to trace model predictions back to
training data, but their use in deep learning is hampered by the need to invert
a large, ill-conditioned Hessian matrix. Approximations such as Generalised
Gauss-Newton (GGN) and Kronecker-Factored Approximate Curvature (K-FAC) have
been proposed to make influence computation tractable, yet it remains unclear
how the departure from exactness impacts data attribution performance.
Critically, given the restricted regime in which influence functions are
derived, it is not necessarily clear better Hessian approximations should even
lead to better data attribution performance. In this paper, we investigate the
effect of Hessian approximation quality on influence-function attributions in a
controlled classification setting. Our experiments show that better Hessian
approximations consistently yield better influence score quality, offering
justification for recent research efforts towards that end. We further
decompose the approximation steps for recent Hessian approximation methods and
evaluate each step's influence on attribution accuracy. Notably, the mismatch
between K-FAC eigenvalues and GGN/EK-FAC eigenvalues accounts for the majority
of the error and influence loss. These findings highlight which approximations
are most critical, guiding future efforts to balance computational tractability
and attribution accuracy.

Motivation: 用户隐私保护和法规遵从要求在模型训练中移除敏感数据，但这一过程通常会导致分布偏移，从而损害模型性能，特别是在分布外场景下。

Method: 引入了(1)保持判别性的因子去相关模块，采用动态自适应权重调整和迭代表示更新来减少特征冗余和最小化特征间相关性；(2)带有损失扰动的平滑数据移除机制，在移除操作期间创建信息论保护以防止数据泄漏。

Result: 在五个基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法优于其他基线方法，即使在显著分布偏移下也能持续实现高预测准确性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法在分布内和分布外场景下都表现出卓越的效率和适应性，为隐私保护下的模型训练提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The imperative of user privacy protection and regulatory compliance
necessitates sensitive data removal in model training, yet this process often
induces distributional shifts that undermine model performance-particularly in
out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. We propose a novel data removal approach
that enhances deep predictive models through factor decorrelation and loss
perturbation. Our approach introduces: (1) a discriminative-preserving factor
decorrelation module employing dynamic adaptive weight adjustment and iterative
representation updating to reduce feature redundancy and minimize inter-feature
correlations. (2) a smoothed data removal mechanism with loss perturbation that
creates information-theoretic safeguards against data leakage during removal
operations. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets show that our
approach outperforms other baselines and consistently achieves high predictive
accuracy and robustness even under significant distribution shifts. The results
highlight its superior efficiency and adaptability in both in-distribution and
out-of-distribution scenarios.

Conclusion: PHASE能够捕捉支配物理规律而非表面相关性，为陆地表面建模和其他复杂科学工作流程提供了实用且物理一致的加速方案。

Abstract: Large-scale numerical simulations underpin modern scientific discovery but
remain constrained by prohibitive computational costs. AI surrogates offer
acceleration, yet adoption in mission-critical settings is limited by concerns
over physical plausibility, trustworthiness, and the fusion of heterogeneous
data. We introduce PHASE, a modular deep-learning framework for
physics-integrated, heterogeneity-aware surrogates in scientific simulations.
PHASE combines data-type-aware encoders for heterogeneous inputs with
multi-level physics-based constraints that promote consistency from local
dynamics to global system behavior. We validate PHASE on the biogeochemical
(BGC) spin-up workflow of the U.S. Department of Energy's Energy Exascale Earth
System Model (E3SM) Land Model (ELM), presenting-to our knowledge-the first
scientifically validated AI-accelerated solution for this task. Using only the
first 20 simulation years, PHASE infers a near-equilibrium state that otherwise
requires more than 1,200 years of integration, yielding an effective reduction
in required integration length by at least 60x. The framework is enabled by a
pipeline for fusing heterogeneous scientific data and demonstrates strong
generalization to higher spatial resolutions with minimal fine-tuning. These
results indicate that PHASE captures governing physical regularities rather
than surface correlations, enabling practical, physically consistent
acceleration of land-surface modeling and other complex scientific workflows.

Abstract: Data selection is designed to accelerate learning with preserved performance.
To achieve this, a fundamental thought is to identify informative data samples
with significant contributions to the training. In this work, we propose
\textbf{Evolved Sampling} (\textbf{ES}), a simple yet effective framework for
\emph{dynamic} sampling along the training process. This method conducts \em
batch \em level data selection based on the dynamics of losses and augmented
\emph{loss differences}, which enables flexible \emph{frequency tuning}, and
hence significantly reduces the back propagation time with maintained model
performance. Due to its conciseness, ES is also readily extensible to
incorporate \em set \em level data selection (to form ES with pruning,
\textbf{ESWP}) for further accelerations. As a plug-and-play framework, ES(WP)
consistently achieves lossless training accelerations across various
pre-training and post-training tasks, saving up to nearly 45\% wall-clock time.
Our results motivate further investigations on the data efficiency aspect of
modern large-scale machine learning.

Motivation: 解决现有基于种群的MARL方法（如PSRO）需要存储显式策略种群和构建完整收益矩阵，导致计算和内存成本高的问题。

Method: 使用紧凑的潜在锚点和单一摊销生成器替代显式种群，通过无偏蒙特卡洛模拟、乘法权重元动力学和无模型经验伯恩斯坦UCB预言机自适应扩展策略集。

Conclusion: GEMS在保持PSRO博弈论保证的同时克服了其基本低效性，实现了多个领域的可扩展多智能体学习。

Abstract: Scalable multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) remains a central
challenge for AI. Existing population-based methods, like Policy-Space Response
Oracles, PSRO, require storing explicit policy populations and constructing
full payoff matrices, incurring quadratic computation and linear memory costs.
We present Generative Evolutionary Meta-Solver (GEMS), a surrogate-free
framework that replaces explicit populations with a compact set of latent
anchors and a single amortized generator. Instead of exhaustively constructing
the payoff matrix, GEMS relies on unbiased Monte Carlo rollouts,
multiplicative-weights meta-dynamics, and a model-free empirical-Bernstein UCB
oracle to adaptively expand the policy set. Best responses are trained within
the generator using an advantage-based trust-region objective, eliminating the
need to store and train separate actors. We evaluated GEMS in a variety of
Two-player and Multi-Player games such as the Deceptive Messages Game, Kuhn
Poker and Multi-Particle environment. We find that GEMS is up to ~6x faster,
has 1.3x less memory usage than PSRO, while also reaps higher rewards
simultaneously. These results demonstrate that GEMS retains the game theoretic
guarantees of PSRO, while overcoming its fundamental inefficiencies, hence
enabling scalable multi-agent learning in multiple domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实时操作中需要频繁求解计算密集的MILP问题，但重新求解成本高昂，如何确定最佳重求解时机是一个重要的经济问题。

Method: 提出POC框架，结合近端策略优化和变点检测，系统性地平衡性能与重求解成本。

Result: 在8个合成和真实数据集上测试，POC比现有基线方法性能提升2%-17%。

Conclusion: POC框架有效解决了MILP重求解时机决策问题，并为实时MILP研究提供了基准和评估标准。

Abstract: A common challenge in real-time operations is deciding whether to re-solve an
optimization problem or continue using an existing solution. While modern data
platforms may collect information at high frequencies, many real-time
operations require repeatedly solving computationally intensive optimization
problems formulated as Mixed-Integer Linear Programs (MILPs). Determining when
to re-solve is, therefore, an economically important question. This problem
poses several challenges: 1) How to characterize solution optimality and
solving cost; 2) How to detect environmental changes and select beneficial
samples for solving the MILP; 3) Given the large time horizon and non-MDP
structure, vanilla reinforcement learning (RL) methods are not directly
applicable and tend to suffer from value function explosion. Existing
literature largely focuses on heuristics, low-data settings, and smooth
objectives, with little focus on common NP-hard MILPs. We propose a framework
called Proximal Policy Optimization with Change Point Detection (POC), which
systematically offers a solution for balancing performance and cost when
deciding appropriate re-solving times. Theoretically, we establish the
relationship between the number of re-solves and the re-solving cost. To test
our framework, we assemble eight synthetic and real-world datasets, and show
that POC consistently outperforms existing baselines by 2%-17%. As a side
benefit, our work fills the gap in the literature by introducing real-time MILP
benchmarks and evaluation criteria.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生产向量数据库升级嵌入模型通常需要重新编码整个语料库和重建近似最近邻索引，导致显著的操作中断和计算成本。

Method: 提出了Drift-Adapter轻量级可学习转换层，包含三种参数化方法：正交Procrustes、低秩仿射和紧凑残差MLP，在少量新旧嵌入对样本上训练。

Result: 在MTEB文本语料库和CLIP图像模型升级实验中，Drift-Adapter恢复了95-99%的检索召回率，仅增加不到10微秒查询延迟，相比完全重新索引降低100倍以上计算成本。

Conclusion: Drift-Adapter作为敏捷模型部署的实用解决方案，能够实现近乎零操作中断的模型升级，具有良好的鲁棒性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Upgrading embedding models in production vector databases typically requires
re-encoding the entire corpus and rebuilding the Approximate Nearest Neighbor
(ANN) index, leading to significant operational disruption and computational
cost. This paper presents Drift-Adapter, a lightweight, learnable
transformation layer designed to bridge embedding spaces between model
versions. By mapping new queries into the legacy embedding space, Drift-Adapter
enables the continued use of the existing ANN index, effectively deferring full
re-computation. We systematically evaluate three adapter parameterizations:
Orthogonal Procrustes, Low-Rank Affine, and a compact Residual MLP, trained on
a small sample of paired old and new embeddings. Experiments on MTEB text
corpora and a CLIP image model upgrade (1M items) show that Drift-Adapter
recovers 95-99% of the retrieval recall (Recall@10, MRR) of a full
re-embedding, adding less than 10 microseconds of query latency. Compared to
operational strategies like full re-indexing or dual-index serving,
Drift-Adapter reduces recompute costs by over 100 times and facilitates
upgrades with near-zero operational interruption. We analyze robustness to
varied model drift, training data size, scalability to billion-item systems,
and the impact of design choices like diagonal scaling, demonstrating
Drift-Adapter's viability as a pragmatic solution for agile model deployment.

*Jiang-Xin Shi,Wen-Da Wei,Jin-Fei Qi,Xuanyu Chen,Tong Wei,Yu-Feng Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出LoRAct方法，通过低秩激活压缩减少参数高效微调中的内存开销，在保持性能的同时降低约80%的激活内存。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 参数高效微调方法虽然减少了可训练参数数量，但内存开销仍然是实际部署的关键瓶颈，特别是模型激活在批量大和上下文长时占用大量内存。

Method: 提出LoRAct方法，利用激活矩阵的低秩特性进行在线压缩，无需校准数据，并设计了基于采样的正交分解算法用于低秩矩阵压缩。

Result: 在视觉和语言任务上的实验表明，LoRAct相比广泛使用的LoRA方法进一步减少了约80%的激活内存，同时保持竞争性性能。

Conclusion: LoRAct提供了一种灵活高效的内存压缩策略，解决了参数高效微调中的内存瓶颈问题，具有实际部署价值。

Abstract: The parameter-efficient fine-tuning paradigm has garnered significant
attention with the advancement of foundation models. Although numerous methods
have been proposed to reduce the number of trainable parameters, their
substantial memory overhead remains a critical bottleneck that hinders
practical deployment. In this paper, we observe that model activations
constitute a major source of memory consumption, especially under large batch
sizes and long context lengths; however, the rank of the activations remains
consistently low. Motivated by this insight, we propose a memory-efficient
fine-tuning approach Low-Rank Activation Compression (LoRAct). Unlike prior
work, LoRAct provides a more flexible and versatile compressing strategy that
can be applied online during the forward pass without the need for any
calibration data. Moreover, LoRAct incorporates a novel sampling-based
orthogonal decomposition algorithm specifically designed for low-rank matrices,
offering improved computational efficiency and a tighter error bound compared
to the widely used RSVD. Experiments on both vision and language tasks
demonstrate the effectiveness of LoRAct. Notably, LoRAct further reduces
activation memory by approximately 80% in comparison with the widely adopted
LoRA method, while maintaining competitive performance. The source code is

TL;DR: 本文在Barron框架下分析了群不变神经网络的泛化误差，发现群不变结构引入了一个群相关因子δ≤1，当δ较小时能显著提高近似精度，而估计误差不受影响，从而为对称目标函数带来统计优势。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究群不变神经网络在对称目标函数学习中的理论优势，为编码对称性结构提供严格的理论基础。

Method: 在Barron框架下分析群不变神经网络的近似误差和Rademacher复杂度，通过理论推导和示例验证。

Result: 群不变结构引入因子δ≤1，当δ小时近似精度显著提升；Rademacher复杂度不大于非不变网络，估计误差不变；泛化误差在对称函数学习中有明显改善。

Conclusion: 编码群不变结构能为对称目标函数带来明确的统计优势，提供了严格的理论支撑。

Abstract: We investigate the generalization error of group-invariant neural networks
within the Barron framework. Our analysis shows that incorporating
group-invariant structures introduces a group-dependent factor
$\delta_{G,\Gamma,\sigma} \le 1$ into the approximation rate. When this factor
is small, group invariance yields substantial improvements in approximation
accuracy. On the estimation side, we establish that the Rademacher complexity
of the group-invariant class is no larger than that of the non-invariant
counterpart, implying that the estimation error remains unaffected by the
incorporation of symmetry. Consequently, the generalization error can improve
significantly when learning functions with inherent group symmetries. We
further provide illustrative examples demonstrating both favorable cases, where
$\delta_{G,\Gamma,\sigma}\approx |G|^{-1}$, and unfavorable ones, where
$\delta_{G,\Gamma,\sigma}\approx 1$. Overall, our results offer a rigorous
theoretical foundation showing that encoding group-invariant structures in
neural networks leads to clear statistical advantages for symmetric target
functions.

Motivation: 机器学习模型在分布变化下往往性能下降，导致对未来数据的预测不准确。研究旨在探索仅依赖过去数据时模型能否实现泛化。

Method: 探索两种主要方法：过去模型参数的凸组合（参数插值）和超出过去参数凸包的显式外推（参数外推），在多种时序任务上进行基准测试。

Result: 实证结果显示，在所有评估场景中，没有任何方法能持续优于简单使用最新可用模型参数的基线方法。

Conclusion: 在没有未来数据访问或对数据生成过程的稳健假设时，这些结果强调了泛化和外推到未来数据的固有困难，并警示在评估此类泛化声明时应保持谨慎。

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models often struggle to maintain performance under
distribution shifts, leading to inaccurate predictions on unseen future data.
In this work, we investigate whether and under what conditions models can
achieve such a generalization when relying solely on past data. We explore two
primary approaches: convex combinations of past model parameters
(\emph{parameter interpolation}) and explicit extrapolation beyond the convex
hull of past parameters (\emph{parameter extrapolation}). We benchmark several
methods within these categories on a diverse set of temporal tasks, including
language modeling, news summarization, news tag prediction, academic paper
categorization, satellite image-based land use classification over time, and
historical yearbook photo gender prediction. Our empirical findings show that
none of the evaluated methods consistently outperforms the simple baseline of
using the latest available model parameters in all scenarios. In the absence of
access to future data or robust assumptions about the underlying
data-generating process, these results underscore the inherent difficulties of
generalizing and extrapolating to future data and warrant caution when
evaluating claims of such generalization.

Conclusion: CRIB通过直接从不完整数据预测的新范式，有效解决了时间序列缺失值预测问题，避免了插值带来的负面影响

Abstract: Missing values are common in real-world time series, and multivariate time
series forecasting with missing values (MTSF-M) has become a crucial area of
research for ensuring reliable predictions. To address the challenge of missing
data, current approaches have developed an imputation-then-prediction framework
that uses imputation modules to fill in missing values, followed by forecasting
on the imputed data. However, this framework overlooks a critical issue: there
is no ground truth for the missing values, making the imputation process
susceptible to errors that can degrade prediction accuracy. In this paper, we
conduct a systematic empirical study and reveal that imputation without direct
supervision can corrupt the underlying data distribution and actively degrade
prediction accuracy. To address this, we propose a paradigm shift that moves
away from imputation and directly predicts from the partially observed time
series. We introduce Consistency-Regularized Information Bottleneck (CRIB), a
novel framework built on the Information Bottleneck principle. CRIB combines a
unified-variate attention mechanism with a consistency regularization scheme to
learn robust representations that filter out noise introduced by missing values
while preserving essential predictive signals. Comprehensive experiments on
four real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of CRIB, which predicts
accurately even under high missing rates. Our code is available in

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着新优化器的普及和模型量化成为高效部署的标准，需要系统研究优化器选择如何影响量化后的模型性能，填补优化器与量化交互研究的空白。

Method: 首先用六种优化器训练全精度模型（5000万到15亿参数），探索超参数空间并建立基准；然后应用后训练量化评估性能退化；最后进行量化感知训练并比较不同优化器的表现。

Result: 发现异常值相关指标无法预测后训练量化性能；在量化感知训练中，Shampoo优化器表现最佳，准确率退化最小，且在所有测试优化器中参数效率最高。

Conclusion: 优化器选择对模型量化鲁棒性有显著影响，Shampoo在量化感知训练中表现最优，为高效模型部署提供了重要指导。

Abstract: As new optimizers gain traction and model quantization becomes standard for
efficient deployment, a key question arises: how does the choice of optimizer
affect model performance in the presence of quantization? Despite progress in
both areas, systematic evidence on optimizer-quantization interactions remains
limited. To fill this gap, we study the impact of optimizer choice on model
robustness under quantization, considering both post-training quantization
(PTQ), and quantization-aware training (QAT). We first train full-precision
models, ranging from 50M to 1.5B parameters, with six optimizers, to explore
the hyperparameter landscape, and establish well-tuned baselines. We then apply
PTQ to evaluate how model performance degrades when trained with different
optimizers. We find that outlier-related metrics, such as the max-to-mean ratio
(MMR) and Kurtosis, fail to predict the PTQ performance across different
optimizers. We show analytically that this is due to the MMR capturing only
isolated layer errors, while ignoring how quantization errors accumulate and
propagate through the network. To study the QAT degradation, we train quantized
models from scratch and compare them to our original-precision baselines. We
find that optimizers performing well in the original pretraining setup may not
remain optimal under QAT, and that models trained with Shampoo show the lowest
accuracy degradation. Finally, we derive scaling laws for quantization-aware
training under different optimizers, showing that Shampoo achieves the highest
parameter efficiency of all tested optimizers.

Conclusion: 所提出的IDMVAE模型通过互信息正则化和扩散先验，有效解决了多模态表示学习中的信息解耦问题，在生成质量和语义一致性方面优于现有方法。

Abstract: Multimodal data are prevalent across various domains, and learning robust
representations of such data is paramount to enhancing generation quality and
downstream task performance. To handle heterogeneity and interconnections among
different modalities, recent multimodal generative models extract shared and
private (modality-specific) information with two separate variables. Despite
attempts to enforce disentanglement between these two variables, these methods
struggle with challenging datasets where the likelihood model is insufficient.
In this paper, we propose Information-disentangled Multimodal VAE (IDMVAE) to
explicitly address this issue, with rigorous mutual information-based
regularizations, including cross-view mutual information maximization for
extracting shared variables, and a cycle-consistency style loss for redundancy
removal using generative augmentations. We further introduce diffusion models
to improve the capacity of latent priors. These newly proposed components are
complementary to each other. Compared to existing approaches, IDMVAE shows a
clean separation between shared and private information, demonstrating superior
generation quality and semantic coherence on challenging datasets.

<details>

Motivation: 当前基因组序列分析方法存在局限性：标准机器学习模型忽略SNP的序列上下文，而Transformer等序列模型在中等规模数据集上计算成本过高。

Method: 开发轻量级1D CNN从高维SNP数据学习预测序列模式，与擅长捕获复杂特征交互的XGBoost模型集成。

Result: 在809株E. coli菌株数据集上，对4种抗生素的耐药性预测均表现优异，CIP的MCC达0.926，GEN的Macro F1-score达0.691。模型能正确聚焦于已知耐药基因如fusA和parC中的SNP。

Conclusion: 融合序列感知的1D CNN和基于特征的XGBoost模型创建了强大的集成框架，克服了单独使用无序模型或序列模型的局限性。

Abstract: Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) is a rapidly escalating global health crisis.
While genomic sequencing enables rapid prediction of resistance phenotypes,
current computational methods have limitations. Standard machine learning
models treat the genome as an unordered collection of features, ignoring the
sequential context of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs). State-of-the-art
sequence models like Transformers are often too data-hungry and computationally
expensive for the moderately-sized datasets that are typical in this domain. To
address these challenges, we propose AMR-EnsembleNet, an ensemble framework
that synergistically combines sequence-based and feature-based learning. We
developed a lightweight, custom 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to
efficiently learn predictive sequence motifs from high-dimensional SNP data.
This sequence-aware model was ensembled with an XGBoost model, a powerful
gradient boosting system adept at capturing complex, non-local feature
interactions. We trained and evaluated our framework on a benchmark dataset of
809 E. coli strains, predicting resistance across four antibiotics with varying
class imbalance. Our 1D CNN-XGBoost ensemble consistently achieved top-tier
performance across all the antibiotics, reaching a Matthews Correlation
Coefficient (MCC) of 0.926 for Ciprofloxacin (CIP) and the highest Macro
F1-score of 0.691 for the challenging Gentamicin (GEN) AMR prediction. We also
show that our model consistently focuses on SNPs within well-known AMR genes
like fusA and parC, confirming it learns the correct genetic signals for
resistance. Our work demonstrates that fusing a sequence-aware 1D CNN with a
feature-based XGBoost model creates a powerful ensemble, overcoming the
limitations of using either an order-agnostic or a standalone sequence model.

TL;DR: MosaCD是一种因果发现方法，结合CI测试和LLM标注生成高置信度种子，通过置信度下降传播策略构建因果图，相比传统方法提高了准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统约束方法如PC依赖完美CI测试和穷举搜索，实际中假设常被违反导致级联错误。LLM可用作专家但存在幻觉问题，需要可靠方法来整合LLM能力。

Method: 使用CI测试和LLM标注生成高置信度种子，引入打乱查询过滤LLM幻觉，采用置信度下降传播策略优先定向最可靠边。

Result: 在多个真实世界图上，MosaCD比现有约束方法在最终图构建中达到更高准确率。

Conclusion: MosaCD通过改进初始种子的可靠性和稳健传播策略，显著提升了因果发现性能。

Abstract: Learning causal structure from observational data is central to scientific
modeling and decision-making. Constraint-based methods aim to recover
conditional independence (CI) relations in a causal directed acyclic graph
(DAG). Classical approaches such as PC and subsequent methods orient
v-structures first and then propagate edge directions from these seeds,
assuming perfect CI tests and exhaustive search of separating subsets --
assumptions often violated in practice, leading to cascading errors in the
final graph. Recent work has explored using large language models (LLMs) as
experts, prompting sets of nodes for edge directions, and could augment edge
orientation when assumptions are not met. However, such methods implicitly
assume perfect experts, which is unrealistic for hallucination-prone LLMs. We
propose MosaCD, a causal discovery method that propagates edges from a
high-confidence set of seeds derived from both CI tests and LLM annotations. To
filter hallucinations, we introduce shuffled queries that exploit LLMs'
positional bias, retaining only high-confidence seeds. We then apply a novel
confidence-down propagation strategy that orients the most reliable edges
first, and can be integrated with any skeleton-based discovery method. Across
multiple real-world graphs, MosaCD achieves higher accuracy in final graph
construction than existing constraint-based methods, largely due to the
improved reliability of initial seeds and robust propagation strategies.

<details>

Motivation: 传统XAI方法在细节和可解释性之间存在权衡，LRP实现通常依赖启发式规则，未针对清晰度或模型行为对齐进行优化。

Method: 应用协方差矩阵自适应进化策略(CMA-ES)来调整LRP超参数，基于忠实度或稀疏度等量化可解释性指标。

Result: EVO-LRP在可解释性指标性能和视觉一致性方面优于传统XAI方法，对类别特定特征具有强敏感性。

Conclusion: 归因质量可以通过原则性的任务特定优化系统性地改进。

Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) methods help identify which image regions influence a
model's prediction, but often face a trade-off between detail and
interpretability. Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) offers a model-aware
alternative. However, LRP implementations commonly rely on heuristic rule sets
that are not optimized for clarity or alignment with model behavior. We
introduce EVO-LRP, a method that applies Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution
Strategy (CMA-ES) to tune LRP hyperparameters based on quantitative
interpretability metrics, such as faithfulness or sparseness. EVO-LRP
outperforms traditional XAI approaches in both interpretability metric
performance and visual coherence, with strong sensitivity to class-specific
features. These findings demonstrate that attribution quality can be
systematically improved through principled, task-specific optimization.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多机器学习任务涉及高维线性算子，只能通过昂贵的矩阵-向量乘积访问。现有方法只能构建低秩或对角线近似，但实际算子往往具有更复杂的结构。

Method: 将SKETCHLORD建模为凸优化问题，开发可扩展算法同时估计低秩和对角线分量。

Result: 理论和实验证明联合估计优于任何顺序变体，在合成数据上准确恢复结构。

Conclusion: SKETCHLORD是高保真近似大规模算子（如深度学习Hessian）的有价值工具。

Abstract: Many relevant machine learning and scientific computing tasks involve
high-dimensional linear operators accessible only via costly matrix-vector
products. In this context, recent advances in sketched methods have enabled the
construction of *either* low-rank *or* diagonal approximations from few
matrix-vector products. This provides great speedup and scalability, but
approximation errors arise due to the assumed simpler structure. This work
introduces SKETCHLORD, a method that simultaneously estimates both low-rank
*and* diagonal components, targeting the broader class of Low-Rank *plus*
Diagonal (LoRD) linear operators. We demonstrate theoretically and empirically
that this joint estimation is superior also to any sequential variant
(diagonal-then-low-rank or low-rank-then-diagonal). Then, we cast SKETCHLORD as
a convex optimization problem, leading to a scalable algorithm. Comprehensive
experiments on synthetic (approximate) LoRD matrices confirm SKETCHLORD's
performance in accurately recovering these structures. This positions it as a
valuable addition to the structured approximation toolkit, particularly when
high-fidelity approximations are desired for large-scale operators, such as the
deep learning Hessian.

Motivation: 传统方法要么维护不断增长的每域任务向量列表导致可扩展性问题，要么在无法访问旧数据时仅依赖权重空间融合从而丢失关键功能信息。

Method: 首先在切线空间中对主模型进行领域特定数据的微调以增强任务间权重解耦；融合时利用优化器状态中的功能信息；融合后通过校正对齐表示差异。

Conclusion: 该框架在恒定内存约束下无需访问历史数据，有效缓解了灾难性遗忘问题，为持续学习提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: We present a holistic framework for continual model merging that intervenes
at three critical stages: pre-merging, during merging, and post-merging-to
address two fundamental challenges in continual learning. In particular,
conventional approaches either maintain a growing list of per-domain task
vectors, leading to scalability issues or rely solely on weight-space merging
when old data is inaccessible, thereby losing crucial functional information.
Our method overcomes these limitations by first fine-tuning the main model
within its tangent space on domain-specific data; this linearization amplifies
per-task weight disentanglement, effectively mitigating across-task
interference. During merging, we leverage functional information from available
optimizer states beyond mere parameter averages to avoid the need to revisit
old data. Finally, a post-merging correction aligns the representation
discrepancy between pre- and post-merged models, reducing bias and enhancing
overall performance-all while operating under constant memory constraints
without accessing historical data. Extensive experiments on standard
class-incremental and domain-incremental benchmarks demonstrate that our
approach not only achieves competitive performance but also provides a scalable
and efficient solution to the catastrophic forgetting problem.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于扩散模型的持续学习方法，通过分析扩散模型在低信噪比下的梯度几何特性，开发了秩1 EWC变体来缓解灾难性遗忘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决持续学习中的灾难性遗忘问题，现有方法如回放和弹性权重巩固(EWC)存在局限：回放需要强生成器且易分布漂移，EWC假设任务间共享最优解且使用对角Fisher近似。

Method: 分析扩散模型在低信噪比下的梯度几何特性，发现样本梯度高度共线，提出秩1 EWC变体，结合回放方法鼓励参数共享并缓解漂移。

Result: 在类增量图像生成数据集上，方法显著改善平均FID并减少遗忘，在MNIST和FashionMNIST上几乎消除遗忘，在ImageNet-1k上遗忘减少约一半。

Conclusion: 扩散模型具有近似秩1的Fisher矩阵，改进的Fisher估计使EWC成为回放的有效补充：回放鼓励参数共享，EWC有效约束回放引起的漂移。

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting remains a central obstacle for continual learning in
neural models. Popular approaches -- replay and elastic weight consolidation
(EWC) -- have limitations: replay requires a strong generator and is prone to
distributional drift, while EWC implicitly assumes a shared optimum across
tasks and typically uses a diagonal Fisher approximation. In this work, we
study the gradient geometry of diffusion models, which can already produce
high-quality replay data. We provide theoretical and empirical evidence that,
in the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime, per-sample gradients become
strongly collinear, yielding an empirical Fisher that is effectively rank-1 and
aligned with the mean gradient. Leveraging this structure, we propose a rank-1
variant of EWC that is as cheap as the diagonal approximation yet captures the
dominant curvature direction. We pair this penalty with a replay-based approach
to encourage parameter sharing across tasks while mitigating drift. On
class-incremental image generation datasets (MNIST, FashionMNIST, CIFAR-10,
ImageNet-1k), our method consistently improves average FID and reduces
forgetting relative to replay-only and diagonal-EWC baselines. In particular,
forgetting is nearly eliminated on MNIST and FashionMNIST and is roughly halved
on ImageNet-1k. These results suggest that diffusion models admit an
approximately rank-1 Fisher. With a better Fisher estimate, EWC becomes a
strong complement to replay: replay encourages parameter sharing across tasks,
while EWC effectively constrains replay-induced drift.

Abstract: Time series forecasting remains a critical challenge across numerous domains,
yet the effectiveness of complex models often varies unpredictably across
datasets. Recent studies highlight the surprising competitiveness of simple
linear models, suggesting that their robustness and interpretability warrant
deeper theoretical investigation. This paper presents a systematic study of
linear models for time series forecasting, with a focus on the role of
characteristic roots in temporal dynamics. We begin by analyzing the noise-free
setting, where we show that characteristic roots govern long-term behavior and
explain how design choices such as instance normalization and channel
independence affect model capabilities. We then extend our analysis to the
noisy regime, revealing that models tend to produce spurious roots. This leads
to the identification of a key data-scaling property: mitigating the influence
of noise requires disproportionately large training data, highlighting the need
for structural regularization. To address these challenges, we propose two
complementary strategies for robust root restructuring. The first uses rank
reduction techniques, including Reduced-Rank Regression and Direct Weight Rank
Reduction, to recover the low-dimensional latent dynamics. The second, a novel
adaptive method called Root Purge, encourages the model to learn a

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图神经网络通常假设类别分布平衡，但在实际图数据中存在类别不平衡问题，导致对少数类别的学习偏差和性能下降，特别是合成节点质量不一致问题

Method: 提出GraphIFE框架，结合图不变学习的两个关键概念，加强嵌入空间表示，识别不变特征以缓解合成节点质量不一致问题

Result: 大量实验表明GraphIFE框架高效且具有鲁棒泛化能力，在多个数据集上持续优于各种基线方法

Conclusion: GraphIFE通过图不变特征提取有效缓解了图数据中的类别不平衡问题，提高了模型对少数类别的识别能力

Abstract: The class imbalance problem refers to the disproportionate distribution of
samples across different classes within a dataset, where the minority classes
are significantly underrepresented. This issue is also prevalent in
graph-structured data. Most graph neural networks (GNNs) implicitly assume a
balanced class distribution and therefore often fail to account for the
challenges introduced by class imbalance, which can lead to biased learning and
degraded performance on minority classes. We identify a quality inconsistency
problem in synthesized nodes, which leads to suboptimal performance under graph
imbalance conditions. To mitigate this issue, we propose GraphIFE (Graph
Invariant Feature Extraction), a novel framework designed to mitigate quality
inconsistency in synthesized nodes. Our approach incorporates two key concepts
from graph invariant learning and introduces strategies to strengthen the
embedding space representation, thereby enhancing the model's ability to
identify invariant features. Extensive experiments demonstrate the framework's
efficiency and robust generalization, as GraphIFE consistently outperforms
various baselines across multiple datasets. The code is publicly available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了DRIK方法，通过3x3分区解决传统2x2分区中的信息泄露问题，并在节点、边和子图三个层面增强时空克里金法的分布外泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统时空克里金法的训练-评估设置存在信息泄露问题，测试数据通过早停影响模型选择，掩盖了真实的分布外泛化特性。

Method: 提出3x3分区干净分离训练、验证和测试集，并设计DRIK方法：扰动节点坐标捕获连续空间关系，丢弃边减少信息流模糊性并增加拓扑多样性，添加伪标记子图增强领域泛化。

Result: 在六个多样化时空数据集上的实验表明，DRIK始终优于现有方法，MAE降低达12.48%，同时保持强可扩展性。

Conclusion: DRIK通过解决信息泄露问题和多层面增强策略，显著提升了时空克里金法的分布外泛化性能。

Abstract: Inductive kriging supports high-resolution spatio-temporal estimation with
sparse sensor networks, but conventional training-evaluation setups often
suffer from information leakage and poor out-of-distribution (OOD)
generalization. We find that the common 2x2 spatio-temporal split allows test
data to influence model selection through early stopping, obscuring the true
OOD characteristics of inductive kriging. To address this issue, we propose a
3x3 partition that cleanly separates training, validation, and test sets,
eliminating leakage and better reflecting real-world applications. Building on
this redefined setting, we introduce DRIK, a Distribution-Robust Inductive
Kriging approach designed with the intrinsic properties of inductive kriging in
mind to explicitly enhance OOD generalization, employing a three-tier strategy
at the node, edge, and subgraph levels. DRIK perturbs node coordinates to
capture continuous spatial relationships, drops edges to reduce ambiguity in
information flow and increase topological diversity, and adds pseudo-labeled
subgraphs to strengthen domain generalization. Experiments on six diverse
spatio-temporal datasets show that DRIK consistently outperforms existing
methods, achieving up to 12.48% lower MAE while maintaining strong scalability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Clebsch-Gordan Transformer，通过新颖的Clebsch-Gordon卷积在SO(3)不可约表示上实现高效全局注意力，解决了等变transformer只能支持低阶等变特征和局部上下文窗口的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统transformer的全局注意力机制计算成本高，而等变模型虽然在某些任务中精度更高，但计算需求大。现有的等变transformer仅支持低阶等变特征和局部上下文窗口，限制了其表达能力和性能。

Method: 采用Clebsch-Gordon卷积在SO(3)不可约表示上实现高效全局注意力，支持所有阶的等变特征建模，计算复杂度为O(N log N)。通过利用Clebsch-Gordon矩阵的稀疏性，能够很好地扩展至高阶不可约特征。还通过权重共享或数据增强实现了可选的token置换等变性。

Result: 在n体模拟、QM9、ModelNet点云分类和机器人抓取数据集等多个基准测试中，相比现有等变transformer，在GPU内存大小、速度和准确性方面都取得了明显提升。

Conclusion: Clebsch-Gordan Transformer能够高效建模所有阶的等变特征，实现了全局注意力机制，在多个任务中表现出优越的性能，为等变transformer的发展提供了新的方向。

Abstract: The global attention mechanism is one of the keys to the success of
transformer architecture, but it incurs quadratic computational costs in
relation to the number of tokens. On the other hand, equivariant models, which
leverage the underlying geometric structures of problem instance, often achieve
superior accuracy in physical, biochemical, computer vision, and robotic tasks,
at the cost of additional compute requirements. As a result, existing
equivariant transformers only support low-order equivariant features and local
context windows, limiting their expressiveness and performance. This work
proposes Clebsch-Gordan Transformer, achieving efficient global attention by a
novel Clebsch-Gordon Convolution on $\SO(3)$ irreducible representations. Our
method enables equivariant modeling of features at all orders while achieving
${O}(N \log N)$ input token complexity. Additionally, the proposed method
scales well with high-order irreducible features, by exploiting the sparsity of
the Clebsch-Gordon matrix. Lastly, we also incorporate optional token
permutation equivariance through either weight sharing or data augmentation. We
benchmark our method on a diverse set of benchmarks including n-body
simulation, QM9, ModelNet point cloud classification and a robotic grasping
dataset, showing clear gains over existing equivariant transformers in GPU
memory size, speed, and accuracy.

competition, and cross-device scheduling complexity. Our solution includes: 1)
Learnable Layer-Aware Predictor (LLaPor) that captures layer-specific expert
activation patterns; 2) Prefetch-Aware Cross-Layer Scheduling (PreSched) that
generates globally optimal plans balancing prefetching costs and loading
overhead; 3) Asynchronous I/O Optimizer (AsyncIO) that decouples I/O from

Abstract: Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) have exhibited powerful
performance in heterogeneous graph learning by aggregating information from
various types of nodes and edges. However, existing heterogeneous graph models
often struggle to capture long-range information or necessitate stacking
numerous layers to learn such dependencies, resulting in high computational
complexity and encountering over-smoothing issues. In this paper, we propose a
Virtual Nodes based Heterogeneous Graph Convolutional Network (VN-HGCN), which
leverages virtual nodes to facilitate enhanced information flow within the
graph. Virtual nodes are auxiliary nodes interconnected with all nodes of a
specific type in the graph, facilitating efficient aggregation of long-range
information across different types of nodes and edges. By incorporating virtual
nodes into the graph structure, VN-HGCN achieves effective information
aggregation with only $4$ layers. Additionally, we demonstrate that VN-HGCN can
serve as a versatile framework that can be seamlessly applied to other HGNN
models, showcasing its generalizability. Empirical evaluations validate the
effectiveness of VN-HGCN, and extensive experiments conducted on three
real-world heterogeneous graph datasets demonstrate the superiority of our
model over several state-of-the-art baselines.

Motivation: 图数据中存在类别不平衡问题，但现有图神经网络通常基于类别平衡假设设计，忽略了这一问题。研究发现某些现成模型受随机种子影响会出现显著性能下降，即随机性异常连接问题（RACP）。

Method: 提出PNS方法，在节点合成阶段直接操作以缓解RACP。与现有专门处理数量不平衡或拓扑不平衡的方法不同，PNS是一个即插即用的模块，同时还能缓解节点邻居异常分布导致的性能下降。

Conclusion: PNS是一个有效的解决方案，能够解决图神经网络中的随机性异常连接问题，提高模型在类别不平衡图数据上的性能和稳定性。

Abstract: The problem of class imbalance refers to an uneven distribution of quantity
among classes in a dataset, where some classes are significantly
underrepresented compared to others. Class imbalance is also prevalent in
graph-structured data. Graph neural networks (GNNs) are typically based on the
assumption of class balance, often overlooking the issue of class imbalance. In
our investigation, we identified a problem, which we term the Randomness
Anomalous Connectivity Problem (RACP), where certain off-the-shelf models are
affected by random seeds, leading to a significant performance degradation. To
eliminate the influence of random factors in algorithms, we proposed PNS (Pure
Node Sampling) to address the RACP in the node synthesis stage. Unlike existing
approaches that design specialized algorithms to handle either quantity
imbalance or topological imbalance, PNS is a novel plug-and-play module that
operates directly during node synthesis to mitigate RACP. Moreover, PNS also
alleviates performance degradation caused by abnormal distribution of node
neighbors. We conduct a series of experiments to identify what factors are
influenced by random seeds. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness
and stability of our method, which not only eliminates the effect of
unfavorable random seeds but also outperforms the baseline across various
benchmark datasets with different GNN backbones. Data and code are available at

Conclusion: 该方法为离散VAE提供了一种有效的训练框架，在高维数据重建任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Discrete latent bottlenecks in variational autoencoders (VAEs) offer high bit
efficiency and can be modeled with autoregressive discrete distributions,
enabling parameter-efficient multimodal search with transformers. However,
discrete random variables do not allow for exact differentiable
parameterization; therefore, discrete VAEs typically rely on approximations,
such as Gumbel-Softmax reparameterization or straight-through gradient
estimates, or employ high-variance gradient-free methods such as REINFORCE that
have had limited success on high-dimensional tasks such as image
reconstruction. Inspired by popular techniques in policy search, we propose a
training framework for discrete VAEs that leverages the natural gradient of a
non-parametric encoder to update the parametric encoder without requiring
reparameterization. Our method, combined with automatic step size adaptation
and a transformer-based encoder, scales to challenging datasets such as
ImageNet and outperforms both approximate reparameterization methods and
quantization-based discrete autoencoders in reconstructing high-dimensional
data from compact latent spaces, achieving a 20% improvement on FID Score for
ImageNet 256.

Abstract: Post-hoc calibration methods are widely used to improve the reliability of
probabilistic predictions from machine learning models. Despite their
prevalence, a comprehensive theoretical understanding of these methods remains
elusive, particularly regarding their performance across different datasets and
model architectures. Input features play a crucial role in shaping model
predictions and, consequently, their calibration. However, the interplay
between feature quality and calibration performance has not been thoroughly
investigated. In this work, we present a rigorous theoretical analysis of
post-hoc calibration methods, focusing on Platt scaling and isotonic
regression. We derive convergence guarantees, computational complexity bounds,
and finite-sample performance metrics for these methods. Furthermore, we
explore the impact of feature informativeness on calibration performance
through controlled synthetic experiments. Our empirical evaluation spans a
diverse set of real-world datasets and model architectures, demonstrating
consistent improvements in calibration metrics across various scenarios. By
examining calibration performance under varying feature conditions utilizing
only informative features versus complete feature spaces including noise
dimensions, we provide fundamental insights into the robustness and reliability
of different calibration approaches. Our findings offer practical guidelines
for selecting appropriate calibration methods based on dataset characteristics
and computational constraints, bridging the gap between theoretical
understanding and practical implementation in uncertainty quantification. Code

Conclusion: UAT框架能够有效解决早退神经网络中的过自信和分布偏移问题，在保持性能的同时显著提升推理效率。

Abstract: Early-Exit Deep Neural Networks enable adaptive inference by allowing
prediction at intermediary layers, significantly reducing computational costs
and latency. Most of the early exit strategies greedily exit a sample at an
intermediary layer if the confidence in class prediction exceeds a predefined
threshold that is set using a static validation set. This is problematic as the
model might be overconfident in a wrong class. Also, they are not robust to
distribution shifts encountered in deployment, which can undermine model
trustworthiness and accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose UAT that
adapts the threshold for exit decisions using a Multi-Armed Bandit framework,
enabling online, unsupervised adjustment of exit decisions. UAT makes decisions
based on a new reward function that assesses predictive certainty and its
reliability to balance computational efficiency and prediction quality while
penalizing unnecessary late exits. We provide guarantees on risk achieved by
UAT and validate its performance on diverse tasks spanning vision-language
understanding, text generation, and classification. Our framework demonstrates
consistent improvements in speedup (1.70-2.10x) with a minimal performance drop
(<2%) as compared to full model performance. Our source code is available at

TL;DR: 论文指出传统的知识蒸馏后对齐流程存在缺陷，提出应先对齐后蒸馏的新流程，通过理论分析和实验证明参考模型的分布召回率对对齐效果至关重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前偏好对齐通常在紧凑的知识蒸馏模型上进行，但忽视了参考模型的分布召回率这一关键属性，导致无法有效对齐罕见但期望的行为。

Method: 提出Align -> KD新流程，先在具有高召回率的参考模型上进行对齐，再进行知识蒸馏；通过混合高斯实验和LLM对齐实验验证理论。

Result: 传统KD -> Align流程在稀有行为对齐上表现不佳，奖励和目标精度显著降低；而Align -> KD流程能稳健对齐目标行为，获得更优的指标和更低方差。

Conclusion: 参考模型的召回率是对齐的一阶设计选择，对齐必须在蒸馏之前进行，这是确保模型能有效学习期望行为的关键原则。

Abstract: For efficiency, preference alignment is often performed on compact,
knowledge-distilled (KD) models. We argue this common practice introduces a
significant limitation by overlooking a key property of the alignment's
reference model: its distributional recall. We show that the standard KD ->
Align workflow diminishes the model's capacity to align rare yet desirable
behaviors, even under strong preference signals. We instead demonstrate that
reversing the pipeline (i.e., Align -> KD) is essential: alignment must first
be performed on a high-recall reference before distillation. Our contributions
are threefold. First, we provide a minimal working explanation of how the
reference model constrains preference alignment objectives at a fundamental
level. Second, we validate this theory in a controllable Mixture-of-Gaussians
experiment, where low-recall anchoring consistently results in suboptimal model
performance. Finally, we demonstrate that the same phenomenon holds in LLM
alignment with the SmolLM2 family: models aligned after KD fail to effectively
align target behaviors, resulting in substantially lower reward and target
precision. In contrast, our proposed Align -> KD pipeline robustly aligns these
behaviors, yielding models with superior target-oriented metrics and lower
variance. Together, these results establish reference-model recall as a
first-order design choice in alignment, offering a clear principle: alignment
must precede distillation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 股票时间序列具有行业相关性，利用这种相关性可以提高预测准确性。但现有基于超图的方法只能相对表面地捕捉行业相关性，存在两个关键限制：未充分考虑行业间的领先滞后交互，以及未建模行业内部和之间的多尺度信息。

Abstract: Time series forecasting occurs in a range of financial applications providing
essential decision-making support to investors, regulatory institutions, and
analysts. Unlike multivariate time series from other domains, stock time series
exhibit industry correlation. Exploiting this kind of correlation can improve
forecasting accuracy. However, existing methods based on hypergraphs can only
capture industry correlation relatively superficially. These methods face two
key limitations: they do not fully consider inter-industry lead-lag
interactions, and they do not model multi-scale information within and among
industries. This study proposes the Hermes framework for stock time series
forecasting that aims to improve the exploitation of industry correlation by
eliminating these limitations. The framework integrates moving aggregation and
multi-scale fusion modules in a hypergraph network. Specifically, to more
flexibly capture the lead-lag relationships among industries, Hermes proposes a
hyperedge-based moving aggregation module. This module incorporates a sliding
window and utilizes dynamic temporal aggregation operations to consider
lead-lag dependencies among industries. Additionally, to effectively model
multi-scale information, Hermes employs cross-scale, edge-to-edge message
passing to integrate information from different scales while maintaining the
consistency of each scale. Experimental results on multiple real-world stock
datasets show that Hermes outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both
efficiency and accuracy.

Result: 在真实世界数据集上的广泛实验表明，DIMIGNN持续优于先前方法。

Conclusion: DIMIGNN通过多样性感知邻居选择和动态多尺度融合有效提升了多元时间序列预测性能。

Abstract: Recently, numerous deep models have been proposed to enhance the performance
of multivariate time series (MTS) forecasting. Among them, Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs)-based methods have shown great potential due to their
capability to explicitly model inter-variable dependencies. However, these
methods often overlook the diversity of information among neighbors, which may
lead to redundant information aggregation. In addition, their final prediction
typically relies solely on the representation from a single temporal scale. To
tackle these issues, we propose a Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with
Diversity-aware Neighbor Selection and Dynamic Multi-scale Fusion (DIMIGNN).
DIMIGNN introduces a Diversity-aware Neighbor Selection Mechanism (DNSM) to
ensure that each variable shares high informational similarity with its
neighbors while maintaining diversity among neighbors themselves. Furthermore,
a Dynamic Multi-Scale Fusion Module (DMFM) is introduced to dynamically adjust
the contributions of prediction results from different temporal scales to the
final forecasting result. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets
demonstrate that DIMIGNN consistently outperforms prior methods.

Motivation: 现有的密集模型缩放定律不适用于MoE模型，因为MoE模型存在影响因素多样性、耦合关系复杂性和性能影响的非单调性等挑战，需要专门研究MoE特定的缩放定律。

Method: 系统分解MoE设置，识别5个关键因素（数据大小D、总模型大小N、激活模型大小Na、激活专家数G、共享专家比例S），设计446个对照实验来表征它们的边际效应，构建综合的联合MoE缩放定律。

Result: 发现G和S的最优设置与模型架构和数据大小无关；随着N的缩放，最优激活参数比例Na/N变得更稀疏；提出了准确且具有洞察力的MoE缩放定律。

Conclusion: 提出的MoE缩放定律可以作为未来MoE模型设计和训练的准确指导，为参数高效扩展和成本效益部署提供理论支持。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have become the consensus approach for
enabling parameter-efficient scaling and cost-effective deployment in large
language models. However, existing scaling laws for dense models are
inapplicable to MoE models, which stems from three critical challenges: the
multiplicity of influencing factors, their intricate coupling relationships and
the non-monotonic nature of their performance impacts. They collectively
necessitate a fine-grained investigation into MoE-specific scaling laws. In
this work, we perform a systematic decomposition of MoE settings, identifying
five key factors that influence model performance from both size and structural
perspectives (data size ($D$), total model size ($N$), activated model size
($N_a$), number of active experts ($G$) and the ratio of shared experts ($S$)).
Specifically, we design $446$ controlled experiments to characterize their
marginal effects, ultimately constructing a comprehensive and precise joint MoE
scaling law that considers all essential factors. Furthermore, we derive the
theoretically optimal and practically efficiency-aware optimal configurations
for $G$, $S$ and $N_a/N$ with detailed analyses. Our results demonstrate that
the optimal settings for $G$ and $S$ are independent of both the model
architecture and data size. With the scaling of $N$, the optimal activation
parameter ratio of $N_a/N$ becomes sparser. Our proposed MoE scaling law could
function as an accurate and insightful guidance to facilitate future MoE model
design and training.

Abstract: Federated continual learning (FCL) has garnered increasing attention for its
ability to support distributed computation in environments with evolving data
distributions. However, the emergence of new tasks introduces both temporal and
cross-client shifts, making catastrophic forgetting a critical challenge. Most
existing works aggregate knowledge from clients into a global model, which may
not enhance client performance since irrelevant knowledge could introduce
interference, especially in heterogeneous scenarios. Additionally, directly
applying decentralized approaches to FCL suffers from ineffective group
formation caused by task changes. To address these challenges, we propose a
decentralized dynamic cooperation framework for FCL, where clients establish
dynamic cooperative learning coalitions to balance the acquisition of new
knowledge and the retention of prior learning, thereby obtaining personalized
models. To maximize model performance, each client engages in selective
cooperation, dynamically allying with others who offer meaningful performance
gains. This results in non-overlapping, variable coalitions at each stage of
the task. Moreover, we use coalitional affinity game to simulate coalition
relationships between clients. By assessing both client gradient coherence and
model similarity, we quantify the client benefits derived from cooperation. We
also propose a merge-blocking algorithm and a dynamic cooperative evolution
algorithm to achieve cooperative and dynamic equilibrium. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method compared to various
baselines. Code is available at: https://github.com/ydn3229/DCFCL.

TL;DR: 提出基于联盟博弈论的机制解释框架，通过神经元联盟分析其在MLP层中的协同计算机制，揭示特征编码的高阶结构


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微调后LLM的MLP层中神经元表征形式不明确，现有方法难以揭示神经元协同工作机制，需要研究神经元如何合作而非孤立工作

Method: 采用联盟博弈论框架，将神经元视为享乐博弈中的智能体，使用PAC-Top-Cover算法提取稳定神经元联盟，追踪跨层演化模式

Result: 在LLaMA、Mistral和Pythia重排器上应用，发现比聚类基线具有更高协同性的联盟，揭示功能重要且可解释的计算单元

Conclusion: 享乐联盟方法超越了特征解缠，揭示了神经元合作编码特征的高阶结构，提供了跨领域预测能力的功能单元

Abstract: Fine-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) encode rich task-specific features,
but the form of these representations, especially within MLP layers, remains
unclear. Empirical inspection of LoRA updates shows that new features
concentrate in mid-layer MLPs, yet the scale of these layers obscures
meaningful structure. Prior probing suggests that statistical priors may
strengthen, split, or vanish across depth, motivating the need to study how
neurons work together rather than in isolation.
  We introduce a mechanistic interpretability framework based on coalitional
game theory, where neurons mimic agents in a hedonic game whose preferences
capture their synergistic contributions to layer-local computations. Using
top-responsive utilities and the PAC-Top-Cover algorithm, we extract stable
coalitions of neurons: groups whose joint ablation has non-additive effects. We
then track their transitions across layers as persistence, splitting, merging,
or disappearance.
  Applied to LLaMA, Mistral, and Pythia rerankers fine-tuned on scalar IR
tasks, our method finds coalitions with consistently higher synergy than
clustering baselines. By revealing how neurons cooperate to encode features,
hedonic coalitions uncover higher-order structure beyond disentanglement and
yield computational units that are functionally important, interpretable, and
predictive across domains.

TL;DR: 提出了一种在联邦学习中集成领域对抗神经网络的方法，通过近端正则化稳定客户端间的对抗训练，解决医学影像中的扫描器引起的领域偏移问题，同时保护数据隐私。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学影像中严格的隐私法规禁止原始数据共享，联邦学习成为自然选择。但扫描器引起的领域偏移会导致模型在外部站点失效，而大多数领域适应方法需要直接比较跨站点数据，与联邦学习的隐私约束冲突。

Method: 在联邦学习过程中集成领域对抗神经网络，并提出近端正则化方法来稳定客户端间的对抗训练，解决朴素联邦DANN不收敛的问题。

Result: 在OpenBHB数据集上的实验显示，在15个站点训练、19个未见站点测试时，该方法在脑龄预测任务上优于FedAvg和ERM，同时保持数据隐私。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了联邦学习中领域偏移问题，实现了更好的跨站点泛化能力，同时严格遵守隐私保护要求。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) trains models locally at each research center or
clinic and aggregates only model updates, making it a natural fit for medical
imaging, where strict privacy laws forbid raw data sharing. A major obstacle is
scanner-induced domain shift: non-biological variations in hardware or
acquisition protocols can cause models to fail on external sites. Most
harmonization methods correct this shift by directly comparing data across
sites, conflicting with FL's privacy constraints. Domain Generalization (DG)
offers a privacy-friendly alternative - learning site-invariant representations
without sharing raw data - but standard DG pipelines still assume centralized
access to multi-site data, again violating FL's guarantees. This paper meets
these difficulties with a straightforward integration of a Domain-Adversarial
Neural Network (DANN) within the FL process. After demonstrating that a naive
federated DANN fails to converge, we propose a proximal regularization method
that stabilizes adversarial training among clients. Experiments on T1-weighted
3-D brain MRIs from the OpenBHB dataset, performing brain-age prediction on
participants aged 6-64 y (mean 22+/-6 y; 45 percent male) in training and 6-79
y (mean 19+/-13 y; 55 percent male) in validation, show that training on 15
sites and testing on 19 unseen sites yields superior cross-site generalization
over FedAvg and ERM while preserving data privacy.

TL;DR: 模型融合(MM)无法可靠防御对抗样本的迁移攻击，反而会增加模型对迁移攻击的脆弱性。研究发现更强的MM方法会提高迁移攻击成功率，缓解表示偏差也会增加脆弱性，而权重平均是最脆弱的MM方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索模型融合对对抗样本迁移性的影响，挑战当前认为MM能提供免费对抗鲁棒性的普遍观点。

Method: 使用8种MM方法、7个数据集和6种攻击方法，在336种不同攻击设置下进行全面评估和统计分析。

Result: MM不能可靠防御迁移攻击，相对迁移攻击成功率超过95%。更强的MM方法、缓解表示偏差都会增加脆弱性，权重平均是最脆弱的MM方法。

Conclusion: 模型融合会增加模型对迁移攻击的脆弱性，研究结果为设计更安全的MM系统提供了关键见解。

Abstract: Model Merging (MM) has emerged as a promising alternative to multi-task
learning, where multiple fine-tuned models are combined, without access to
tasks' training data, into a single model that maintains performance across
tasks. Recent works have explored the impact of MM on adversarial attacks,
particularly backdoor attacks. However, none of them have sufficiently explored
its impact on transfer attacks using adversarial examples, i.e., a black-box
adversarial attack where examples generated for a surrogate model successfully
mislead a target model.
  In this work, we study the effect of MM on the transferability of adversarial
examples. We perform comprehensive evaluations and statistical analysis
consisting of 8 MM methods, 7 datasets, and 6 attack methods, sweeping over 336
distinct attack settings. Through it, we first challenge the prevailing notion
of MM conferring free adversarial robustness, and show MM cannot reliably
defend against transfer attacks, with over 95% relative transfer attack success
rate. Moreover, we reveal 3 key insights for machine-learning practitioners
regarding MM and transferability for a robust system design: (1) stronger MM
methods increase vulnerability to transfer attacks; (2) mitigating
representation bias increases vulnerability to transfer attacks; and (3) weight
averaging, despite being the weakest MM method, is the most vulnerable MM
method to transfer attacks. Finally, we analyze the underlying reasons for this
increased vulnerability, and provide potential solutions to the problem. Our
findings offer critical insights for designing more secure systems employing
MM.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着时间序列基础模型(TSFMs)数量的增加，在有限公共数据的领域中高效识别最适合下游微调的模型变得越来越具有挑战性。

Method: 将模型选择重新定义为上下文学习问题，利用数据集元特征、模型特征和微调性能形成的表格结构，使用表格基础模型作为上下文学习器，并引入基于模型层间熵演化的新型模型特征化方法。

Result: 在包含10个数据集、10个基础模型和3个预测任务的基准测试中，TimeTic的估计与未见数据集的真实微调性能高度一致，平均秩相关约为0.6，比使用零样本性能作为可迁移性得分提高了30%。

Conclusion: TimeTic框架能够有效预测时间序列基础模型在下游数据集上的微调性能，为模型选择提供了高效可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Time series foundation models (TSFMs) offer strong zero-shot forecasting via
large-scale pre-training, yet fine-tuning remains critical for boosting
performance in domains with limited public data. With the growing number of
TSFMs, efficiently identifying the best model for downstream fine-tuning
becomes increasingly challenging. In this work, we introduce TimeTic, a
transferability estimation framework that recasts model selection as an
in-context-learning problem: given observations on known (source) datasets, it
predicts how a TSFM will perform after fine-tuning on a downstream (target)
dataset. TimeTic flexibly organizes the observed model-data relationships as
contextual information, allowing it to adapt seamlessly to various test-time
scenarios. Leveraging the natural tabular structure formed by dataset
meta-features, model characteristics, and fine-tuned performance, we employ
tabular foundation models to serve as in-context learners. We further introduce
a novel model characterization based on entropy evolution across model layers,
capturing embedding-space distinctions and enabling TimeTic to generalize
across arbitrary model sets. We establish a comprehensive benchmark for
transferability estimation including 10 datasets, 10 foundation models, and 3
forecasting tasks. On this benchmark, TimeTic's estimation demonstrates strong
alignment with actual fine-tuned performance for previously unseen datasets,
achieving a mean rank correlation of approximately 0.6 and a 30% improvement
compared to using zero-shot performance as the transferability score.

Conclusion: 提出的连续时间确定性策略梯度方法CT-DDPG能够有效解决连续环境中的强化学习问题，具有优越的稳定性和收敛性能。

Abstract: The theory of discrete-time reinforcement learning (RL) has advanced rapidly
over the past decades. Although primarily designed for discrete environments,
many real-world RL applications are inherently continuous and complex. A major
challenge in extending discrete-time algorithms to continuous-time settings is
their sensitivity to time discretization, often leading to poor stability and
slow convergence. In this paper, we investigate deterministic policy gradient
methods for continuous-time RL. We derive a continuous-time policy gradient
formula based on an analogue of the advantage function and establish its
martingale characterization. This theoretical foundation leads to our proposed
algorithm, CT-DDPG, which enables stable learning with deterministic policies
in continuous-time environments. Numerical experiments show that the proposed
CT-DDPG algorithm offers improved stability and faster convergence compared to
existing discrete-time and continuous-time methods, across a wide range of
control tasks with varying time discretizations and noise levels.

either the time or positional component. On the held-out test set it delivers
the highest AUROC and PRAUC.

Motivation: 术中低血压与术后并发症密切相关，现有AI预警模型在时频域信息整合、长短时依赖捕捉和噪声处理方面存在局限。

Method: SAFDNet包含自适应频谱块(利用傅里叶分析提取频域特征并采用自适应阈值降噪)和交互注意力块(捕捉长短时依赖关系)。

Conclusion: SAFDNet在术中低血压早期预警方面表现出色，适合实际临床应用，为围手术期护理提供了有效的预测工具。

Abstract: Intraoperative hypotension (IOH) is strongly associated with postoperative
complications, including postoperative delirium and increased mortality, making
its early prediction crucial in perioperative care. While several artificial
intelligence-based models have been developed to provide IOH warnings, existing
methods face limitations in incorporating both time and frequency domain
information, capturing short- and long-term dependencies, and handling noise
sensitivity in biosignal data. To address these challenges, we propose a novel
Self-Adaptive Frequency Domain Network (SAFDNet). Specifically, SAFDNet
integrates an adaptive spectral block, which leverages Fourier analysis to
extract frequency-domain features and employs self-adaptive thresholding to
mitigate noise. Additionally, an interactive attention block is introduced to
capture both long-term and short-term dependencies in the data. Extensive
internal and external validations on two large-scale real-world datasets
demonstrate that SAFDNet achieves up to 97.3\% AUROC in IOH early warning,
outperforming state-of-the-art models. Furthermore, SAFDNet exhibits robust
predictive performance and low sensitivity to noise, making it well-suited for
practical clinical applications.

Conclusion: GBSK算法通过粒度球技术有效解决了大规模数据聚类问题，在保持高精度的同时显著提升了计算效率，适用于实际应用场景。

Abstract: To effectively handle clustering task for large-scale datasets, we propose a
novel scalable skeleton clustering algorithm, namely GBSK, which leverages the
granular-ball technique to capture the underlying structure of data. By
multi-sampling the dataset and constructing multi-grained granular-balls, GBSK
progressively uncovers a statistical "skeleton" -- a spatial abstraction that
approximates the essential structure and distribution of the original data.
This strategy enables GBSK to dramatically reduce computational overhead while
maintaining high clustering accuracy. In addition, we introduce an adaptive
version, AGBSK, with simplified parameter settings to enhance usability and
facilitate deployment in real-world scenarios. Extensive experiments conducted
on standard computing hardware demonstrate that GBSK achieves high efficiency
and strong clustering performance on large-scale datasets, including one with
up to 100 million instances across 256 dimensions. Our implementation and

Motivation: 符号音乐生成面临效率与质量的基本权衡：细粒度标记化实现强连贯性但序列长、复杂度高，而紧凑标记化提高效率但牺牲标记内依赖关系。

Method: 采用延迟调度机制(DP)，将复合类标记在解码步骤中展开，实现标记内依赖关系的自回归建模，该策略轻量级、无额外参数，可无缝集成到现有表示中。

Result: 在符号管弦乐MIDI数据集上的实验表明，该方法在所有指标上都优于标准复合标记化，并缩小了与细粒度标记化的差距。

Conclusion: 延迟调度机制(DP)是一种有效的解决方案，能够在符号音乐生成中平衡效率与质量，改善紧凑标记化的性能表现。

Abstract: Symbolic music generation faces a fundamental trade-off between efficiency
and quality. Fine-grained tokenizations achieve strong coherence but incur long
sequences and high complexity, while compact tokenizations improve efficiency
at the expense of intra-token dependencies. To address this, we adapt a
delay-based scheduling mechanism (DP) that expands compound-like tokens across
decoding steps, enabling autoregressive modeling of intra-token dependencies
while preserving efficiency. Notably, DP is a lightweight strategy that
introduces no additional parameters and can be seamlessly integrated into
existing representations. Experiments on symbolic orchestral MIDI datasets show
that our method improves all metrics over standard compound tokenizations and
narrows the gap to fine-grained tokenizations.

Conclusion: 通过适当的应用方式，BN能够适应DRL中不断变化的数据分布，提升收敛速度和最终性能，MA-BN为BN在DRL中的稳健集成提供了实用建议。

Abstract: Batch Normalization (BN) has played a pivotal role in the success of deep
learning by improving training stability, mitigating overfitting, and enabling
more effective optimization. However, its adoption in deep reinforcement
learning (DRL) has been limited due to the inherent non-i.i.d. nature of data
and the dynamically shifting distributions induced by the agent's learning
process. In this paper, we argue that, despite these challenges, BN retains
unique advantages in DRL settings, particularly through its stochasticity and
its ability to ease training. When applied appropriately, BN can adapt to
evolving data distributions and enhance both convergence speed and final
performance. To this end, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study on the use
of BN in off-policy actor-critic algorithms, systematically analyzing how
different training and evaluation modes impact performance. We further identify
failure modes that lead to instability or divergence, analyze their underlying
causes, and propose the Mode-Aware Batch Normalization (MA-BN) method with
practical actionable recommendations for robust BN integration in DRL
pipelines. We also empirically validate that, in RL settings, MA-BN accelerates
and stabilizes training, broadens the effective learning rate range, enhances
exploration, and reduces overall optimization difficulty. Our code is available

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的后训练需要在监督微调(SFT)和强化学习(RL)之间权衡：SFT效率高但容易过拟合，RL泛化更好但计算成本高。DFT作为折中方案在某些任务中表现不稳定。

Method: 通过奖励加权回归(RWR)框架分析DFT，发现其缺乏分布锚定导致训练不稳定。提出ASFT方法，在DFT重加权基础上添加轻量级KL正则化来保持稳定性。

Conclusion: RWR框架为理解后训练方法提供了系统性视角，表明原则性理论分析既能提供更强保证又能带来实际收益。

Abstract: Post-training of large language models involves a fundamental trade-off
between supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which efficiently mimics demonstrations
but tends to memorize, and reinforcement learning (RL), which achieves better
generalization at higher computational cost. Dynamic Fine-Tuning (DFT) recently
emerged as a promising middle ground, reweighting SFT objectives with token
probabilities and achieving improvements in certain reasoning domains, though
it exhibits instability in other tasks. We provide a analysis of DFT through
the reward-weighted regression (RWR) framework, revealing that it corresponds
to a specific auxiliary distribution choice that yields provably tighter RL
bounds than standard SFT. However, our analysis also uncovers a critical
limitation: this construction lacks distributional anchoring, leading to
progressive drift that undermines training stability. To address this, we
propose Anchored Supervised Fine-Tuning (ASFT), which augments DFT's
reweighting with lightweight KL regularization to preserve tightness while
ensuring stability. Empirically, ASFT consistently outperforms both SFT and DFT
across mathematical reasoning, medical knowledge grounding, and code
generation, achieving substantial improvements with minimal computational
overhead. Our RWR framework provides a systematic lens for understanding
post-training methods and demonstrates that principled theoretical analysis
leads to both stronger guarantees and practical gains.

Abstract: Interpretable risk scores play a vital role in clinical decision support, yet
traditional methods for deriving such scores often rely on manual
preprocessing, task-specific modeling, and simplified assumptions that limit
their flexibility and predictive power. We present SHAPoint, a novel,
task-agnostic framework that integrates the predictive accuracy of gradient
boosted trees with the interpretability of point-based risk scores. SHAPoint
supports classification, regression, and survival tasks, while also inheriting
valuable properties from tree-based models, such as native handling of missing
data and support for monotonic constraints. Compared to existing frameworks,
SHAPoint offers superior flexibility, reduced reliance on manual preprocessing,
and faster runtime performance. Empirical results show that SHAPoint produces
compact and interpretable scores with predictive performance comparable to
state-of-the-art methods, but at a fraction of the runtime, making it a
powerful tool for transparent and scalable risk stratification.

Conclusion: LLMs中的知识组织遵循同质性原则，利用这一特性可以优化知识注入和推理任务，为LLMs作为知识库的应用提供新视角。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been increasingly studied as neural
knowledge bases for supporting knowledge-intensive applications such as
question answering and fact checking. However, the structural organization of
their knowledge remains unexplored. Inspired by cognitive neuroscience
findings, such as semantic clustering and priming, where knowing one fact
increases the likelihood of recalling related facts, we investigate an
analogous knowledge homophily pattern in LLMs. To this end, we map LLM
knowledge into a graph representation through knowledge checking at both the
triplet and entity levels. After that, we analyze the knowledgeability
relationship between an entity and its neighbors, discovering that LLMs tend to
possess a similar level of knowledge about entities positioned closer in the
graph. Motivated by this homophily principle, we propose a Graph Neural Network
(GNN) regression model to estimate entity-level knowledgeability scores for
triplets by leveraging their neighborhood scores. The predicted
knowledgeability enables us to prioritize checking less well-known triplets,
thereby maximizing knowledge coverage under the same labeling budget. This not
only improves the efficiency of active labeling for fine-tuning to inject
knowledge into LLMs but also enhances multi-hop path retrieval in
reasoning-intensive question answering.

TL;DR: 本文研究了Mamba模型在线性回归任务中的训练动态，建立了其指数收敛率，并揭示了Mamba通过在线梯度下降变体实现上下文学习的机制，这与Transformer的梯度下降模拟机制不同。


<details>

Motivation: 尽管Mamba在长序列建模中表现出与Transformer竞争的上文学习能力，但其理论理解仍然有限，特别是在线性回归等基础任务上的机制尚未得到深入分析。

Method: 通过开发针对Mamba结构的非凸优化新技术，分析其在梯度下降训练过程中的动态特性，并建立理论收敛性分析框架。

Result: 证明了Mamba在线性回归任务中能够以指数速率收敛到上下文学习解，损失边界与Transformer相当，并发现其通过在线梯度下降变体学习潜在函数。

Conclusion: Mamba通过不同于Transformer的机制实现上下文学习，即在线梯度下降变体，这一发现为理解状态空间模型的上下文学习能力提供了新的理论视角。

Abstract: State-space models (SSMs), particularly Mamba, emerge as an efficient
Transformer alternative with linear complexity for long-sequence modeling.
Recent empirical works demonstrate Mamba's in-context learning (ICL)
capabilities competitive with Transformers, a critical capacity for large
foundation models. However, theoretical understanding of Mamba's ICL remains
limited, restricting deeper insights into its underlying mechanisms. Even
fundamental tasks such as linear regression ICL, widely studied as a standard
theoretical benchmark for Transformers, have not been thoroughly analyzed in
the context of Mamba. To address this gap, we study the training dynamics of
Mamba on the linear regression ICL task. By developing novel techniques
tackling non-convex optimization with gradient descent related to Mamba's
structure, we establish an exponential convergence rate to ICL solution, and
derive a loss bound that is comparable to Transformer's. Importantly, our
results reveal that Mamba can perform a variant of \textit{online gradient
descent} to learn the latent function in context. This mechanism is different
from that of Transformer, which is typically understood to achieve ICL through
gradient descent emulation. The theoretical results are verified by
experimental simulation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文首次系统评估了Visual CoT在视觉扰动下的鲁棒性，发现虽然Visual CoT能提升准确率，但对输入扰动更敏感。作者提出了一种基于Grounding DINO的增强方法来稳定推理过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual CoT技术通过整合视觉编辑显著提升了多模态推理性能，但其在图像噪声下的鲁棒性尚未被探索。本文旨在填补这一研究空白。

Method: 构建了包含12种图像损坏类型和4个VQA数据集的基准测试，比较使用和不使用Visual CoT的VLMs。提出基于Grounding DINO的插件式鲁棒性增强方法，为推理提供高置信度的局部视觉线索。

Result: Visual CoT在干净和噪声图像上都能提升绝对准确率，但对输入扰动更敏感，性能下降更明显。中间推理组件（编辑的图像块）是脆弱性的主要来源。

Conclusion: 揭示了Visual CoT的脆弱性模式，并提供了有效的架构无关解决方案来增强视觉鲁棒性。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) techniques have significantly enhanced reasoning in
Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Extending this paradigm, Visual CoT integrates
explicit visual edits, such as cropping or annotating regions of interest, into
the reasoning process, achieving superior multimodal performance. However, the
robustness of Visual CoT-based VLMs against image-level noise remains
unexplored. In this paper, we present the first systematic evaluation of Visual
CoT robustness under visual perturbations. Our benchmark spans 12 image
corruption types across 4 Visual Question Answering (VQA) datasets, enabling a
comprehensive comparison between VLMs that use Visual CoT, and VLMs that do
not. The results reveal that integrating Visual CoT consistently improves
absolute accuracy regardless of whether the input images are clean or corrupted
by noise; however, it also increases sensitivity to input perturbations,
resulting in sharper performance degradation compared to standard VLMs. Through
extensive analysis, we identify the intermediate reasoning components of Visual
CoT, i.e., the edited image patches , as the primary source of fragility.
Building on this analysis, we propose a plug-and-play robustness enhancement
method that integrates Grounding DINO model into the Visual CoT pipeline,
providing high-confidence local visual cues to stabilize reasoning. Our work
reveals clear fragility patterns in Visual CoT and offers an effective,
architecture-agnostic solution for enhancing visual robustness.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出SAE-RSV方法，通过稀疏自编码器对从小数据集提取的引导向量进行语义去噪和增强，解决有限数据场景下引导向量包含任务无关噪声特征的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有引导方法依赖大规模数据集来学习清晰的行为信息，限制了在现实场景中的应用。从小数据集提取的引导向量往往包含任务无关的噪声特征，影响其有效性。

Method: 使用稀疏自编码器对引导向量进行语义去噪和增强：首先根据SAE提供的语义去除任务无关特征，然后通过语义相似性丰富任务相关特征。

Result: 大量实验表明，SAE-RSV显著优于所有基线方法，包括监督微调。

Conclusion: 通过SAE对原始引导向量进行精炼，可以从有限训练数据构建有效的引导向量。

Abstract: Steering has emerged as a promising approach in controlling large language
models (LLMs) without modifying model parameters. However, most existing
steering methods rely on large-scale datasets to learn clear behavioral
information, which limits their applicability in many real-world scenarios. The
steering vectors extracted from small dataset often contain task-irrelevant
noising features, which degrades their effectiveness. To refine the steering
vectors learned from limited data, we introduce Refinement of Steering Vector
via Sparse Autoencoder (SAE-RSV) that leverages SAEs to semantically denoise
and augment the steering vectors. In our framework, we first remove
task-irrelevant features according to their semantics provided by SAEs, and
then enrich task-relevant features missing from the small dataset through their
semantic similarity to the identified relevant features. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that the proposed SAE-RSV substantially outperforms all the
baseline methods including supervised fine-tuning. Our findings show that
effective steering vector can be constructed from limited training data by
refining the original steering vector through SAEs.

TL;DR: 提出STAIR方法解决多阶段任务中偏好强化学习的阶段错位问题，通过时间距离学习阶段划分，优先同阶段比较，提升奖励学习效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 偏好强化学习在多阶段任务中存在阶段错位问题，比较不同阶段（如移动vs操作）的片段会产生无意义的反馈，阻碍策略学习。

Method: STAIR方法：1）基于时间距离学习阶段近似；2）通过对比学习将时间相近的状态分组到连贯阶段；3）优先同阶段比较；4）无需预定义任务知识，能动态适应策略变化。

Result: 大量实验表明STAIR在多阶段任务中表现优越，在单阶段任务中具有竞争力。人类研究证实STAIR近似的阶段与人类认知一致。

Conclusion: STAIR有效缓解了多阶段任务中的阶段错位问题，提高了偏好强化学习的性能，且学习到的阶段划分与人类认知相符。

Abstract: Preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL) bypasses complex reward
engineering by learning rewards directly from human preferences, enabling
better alignment with human intentions. However, its effectiveness in
multi-stage tasks, where agents sequentially perform sub-tasks (e.g.,
navigation, grasping), is limited by stage misalignment: Comparing segments
from mismatched stages, such as movement versus manipulation, results in
uninformative feedback, thus hindering policy learning. In this paper, we
validate the stage misalignment issue through theoretical analysis and
empirical experiments. To address this issue, we propose STage-AlIgned Reward
learning (STAIR), which first learns a stage approximation based on temporal
distance, then prioritizes comparisons within the same stage. Temporal distance
is learned via contrastive learning, which groups temporally close states into
coherent stages, without predefined task knowledge, and adapts dynamically to
policy changes. Extensive experiments demonstrate STAIR's superiority in
multi-stage tasks and competitive performance in single-stage tasks.
Furthermore, human studies show that stages approximated by STAIR are
consistent with human cognition, confirming its effectiveness in mitigating
stage misalignment.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个基于智能代理的联邦学习框架，旨在解决医疗领域联邦学习部署中的实际协调挑战，包括客户端选择、数据预处理、算法选择等操作瓶颈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的联邦学习部署面临复杂的操作挑战，需要大量人工干预，包括客户端选择、协调、数据预处理、数据标准化和算法选择等。现有研究忽视了这些实际协调问题，因此需要开发自主的、基于代理的联邦学习系统。

Method: 提出了一个代理驱动的联邦学习框架，涵盖从客户端选择到训练完成的整个工作流程。创建了FedAgentBench基准测试，评估LLM代理在医疗联邦学习中的自主协调能力。框架包含40种联邦学习算法，针对不同任务需求和跨客户端特性进行了定制。

Result: 评估了14个开源和10个专有LLM的代理性能，涵盖小、中、大模型规模。结果显示，虽然GPT-4.1和DeepSeek V3等代理核心能够自动化联邦学习管道的多个阶段，但基于隐含目标的复杂、相互依赖的任务对即使是最强的模型仍然具有挑战性。

Conclusion: 代理驱动的联邦学习框架能够显著减少医疗联邦学习部署中的人工干预需求，但复杂任务的自动化仍面临挑战，需要进一步研究改进。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) allows collaborative model training across healthcare
sites without sharing sensitive patient data. However, real-world FL deployment
is often hindered by complex operational challenges that demand substantial
human efforts. This includes: (a) selecting appropriate clients (hospitals),
(b) coordinating between the central server and clients, (c) client-level data
pre-processing, (d) harmonizing non-standardized data and labels across
clients, and (e) selecting FL algorithms based on user instructions and
cross-client data characteristics. However, the existing FL works overlook
these practical orchestration challenges. These operational bottlenecks
motivate the need for autonomous, agent-driven FL systems, where intelligent
agents at each hospital client and the central server agent collaboratively
manage FL setup and model training with minimal human intervention. To this
end, we first introduce an agent-driven FL framework that captures key phases
of real-world FL workflows from client selection to training completion and a
benchmark dubbed FedAgentBench that evaluates the ability of LLM agents to
autonomously coordinate healthcare FL. Our framework incorporates 40 FL
algorithms, each tailored to address diverse task-specific requirements and
cross-client characteristics. Furthermore, we introduce a diverse set of
complex tasks across 201 carefully curated datasets, simulating 6
modality-specific real-world healthcare environments, viz., Dermatoscopy,
Ultrasound, Fundus, Histopathology, MRI, and X-Ray. We assess the agentic
performance of 14 open-source and 10 proprietary LLMs spanning small, medium,
and large model scales. While some agent cores such as GPT-4.1 and DeepSeek V3
can automate various stages of the FL pipeline, our results reveal that more
complex, interdependent tasks based on implicit goals remain challenging for
even the strongest models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文挑战了强化学习中探索-利用权衡的传统观点，提出这种权衡可能是度量层级造成的假象。通过转向隐藏状态空间分析，发现探索和利用可以解耦，并开发了VERL方法实现协同增强。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新审视RLVR领域中的探索-利用权衡观点，认为这种权衡可能不是基本约束，而是度量层级的产物。通过更丰富的语义隐藏状态空间分析，寻求同时增强探索和利用能力的机会。

Method: 提出Velocity-Exploiting Rank-Learning (VERL)方法，在隐藏状态空间使用有效秩(ER)及其导数ERV和ERA来量化探索和利用动态。通过直接塑造RL优势函数，利用理论稳定的ERA作为预测元控制器，创建协同的双通道激励结构。

Result: 实验显示在多种LLM和推理基准上获得一致提升，在具有挑战性的Gaokao 2024数据集上实现了高达21.4%的绝对准确率提升。

Conclusion: 探索和利用在隐藏状态层面可以解耦，这为同时增强两种能力提供了机会。VERL方法成功实现了探索-利用的协同增强，避免了传统权衡限制。

Abstract: A prevailing view in Reinforcement Learning for Verifiable Rewards (RLVR)
interprets recent progress through the lens of an exploration-exploitation
trade-off, a perspective largely shaped by token-level metrics. We re-examine
this perspective, proposing that this perceived trade-off may not be a
fundamental constraint but rather an artifact of the measurement level. To
investigate this, we shift the analysis to the semantically rich hidden-state
space, adopting Effective Rank (ER) to quantify exploration and proposing its
novel first- and second-order derivatives, named Effective Rank Velocity (ERV)
and Effective Rank Acceleration (ERA), to capture exploitation dynamics. Our
analysis reveals that at the hidden-state level, exploration and exploitation
could be decoupled (Sec. 4). This finding reveals an opportunity to enhance
both capacities simultaneously. This insight motivates our method,
Velocity-Exploiting Rank-Learning (VERL), the first to operationalize the
principle of synergistic exploration-exploitation enhancement by directly
shaping the RL advantage function. The key innovation is leveraging the
theoretically stable ERA as a predictive meta-controller to create a
synergistic, dual-channel incentive structure. Instead of forcing a trade-off,
VERL prospectively amplifies rewards for exploration to preempt overconfidence
and reinforces exploitative gains to consolidate reasoning. Experiments across
diverse LLMs and reasoning benchmarks show consistent gains, including up to
21.4% absolute accuracy improvement on the challenging Gaokao 2024 dataset.

*Hong Huang,Decheng Wu,Rui Cen,Guanghua Yu,Zonghang Li,Kai Liu,Jianchen Zhu,Peng Chen,Xue Liu,Dapeng Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Tequila是一种针对大型语言模型的三元量化优化方法，通过将死区陷阱权重重新用作动态偏置，解决了传统三元量化导致的精度下降问题，在保持高效推理的同时显著提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统三元量化方法虽然能通过将权重约束为{-1, 0, 1}来用加法替代乘法，但会导致严重的精度损失，核心问题是死区陷阱现象——大量权重被困在死区边界，只能接收噪声梯度而无法稳定逃离。

Method: 提出Tequila方法，将死区陷阱权重重新用作动态偏置，使这些权重在前向传播中提供连续信号，在反向传播中接收直接有意义的梯度信号，从而增强模型容量和优化效果，且几乎不增加推理开销。

Result: 在五个基准测试中优于最先进的三元量化方法，在ARC基准上比SOTA基线提升>4%准确率，接近全精度性能（差距<1%），同时实现3.0倍推理加速。

Conclusion: Tequila为在资源受限环境中部署先进LLMs提供了高度实用和高效的解决方案，代码已在GitHub开源。

Abstract: Quantization techniques are essential for the deployment of Large Language
Models (LLMs) on edge devices. However, prevailing methods often rely on
mixed-precision multiplication that lacks efficient hardware support, making it
not feasible. Ternary weight quantization addresses this by constraining
weights to {-1, 0, 1}, replacing expensive multiplications with
hardware-efficient additions. However, such aggressive compression leads to
significant accuracy degradation, even after costly quantization-aware training
with massive data. We identify the core issue as deadzone trapping: a large
number of weights are trapped at the deadzone boundary. This occurs because
these weights receive only noisy, uninformative gradients, preventing stable
escape from the deadzone and severely impeding model capacity and optimization.
To address this issue, we propose Tequila, a trapping-free quantization
optimization method that reactivates deadzone-trapped weights by repurposing
them as dynamic biases. This allows the repurposed weights to provide a
continuous signal in the forward pass and, critically, receive direct,
meaningful gradient signals during backpropagation, thereby enhancing model
capacity and optimization with nearly zero inference overhead. Extensive
evaluations demonstrate that Tequila outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA)
ternary quantization methods across five benchmarks. Specifically, on the ARC
benchmark, it achieves >4% accuracy gain over the SOTA baseline, nearly
matching full-precision performance (within <1% gap) with a 3.0x inference
speedup. Consequently, Tequila offers a highly practical and efficient
implementation for the deployment of advanced LLMs in resource-constrained
environments. The code is available at https://github.com/Tencent/AngelSlim.

TL;DR: 提出了IndexNet，一种基于MLP的多变量时间序列预测框架，通过索引嵌入模块利用时间戳和变量索引的描述性信息来提升预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法大多忽略了时间戳和变量索引等描述性信息，这些信息包含丰富的上下文语义，对提升多变量时间序列预测性能具有潜力。

Method: IndexNet包含索引嵌入模块，由时间戳嵌入和通道嵌入组成。时间戳嵌入将时间戳转换为嵌入向量注入输入序列，通道嵌入为每个变量分配可训练的身份嵌入。

Result: 在12个真实世界数据集上的实验表明，IndexNet在主流基线方法中取得了可比性能，验证了时间感知和变量感知设计的有效性。

Conclusion: IndexNet展示了强大的泛化性和可解释性，这两个方面在当前多变量时间序列预测研究中仍未充分探索。

Abstract: Multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF) plays a vital role in a wide
range of real-world applications, such as weather prediction and traffic flow
forecasting. Although recent advances have significantly improved the modeling
of temporal dynamics and inter-variable dependencies, most existing methods
overlook index-related descriptive information, such as timestamps and variable
indices, which carry rich contextual semantics. To unlock the potential of such
information and take advantage of the lightweight and powerful periodic capture
ability of MLP-based architectures, we propose IndexNet, an MLP-based framework
augmented with an Index Embedding (IE) module. The IE module consists of two
key components: Timestamp Embedding (TE) and Channel Embedding (CE).
Specifically, TE transforms timestamps into embedding vectors and injects them
into the input sequence, thereby improving the model's ability to capture
long-term complex periodic patterns. In parallel, CE assigns each variable a
unique and trainable identity embedding based on its index, allowing the model
to explicitly distinguish between heterogeneous variables and avoid homogenized
predictions when input sequences seem close. Extensive experiments on 12
diverse real-world datasets demonstrate that IndexNet achieves comparable
performance across mainstream baselines, validating the effectiveness of our
temporally and variably aware design. Moreover, plug-and-play experiments and
visualization analyses further reveal that IndexNet exhibits strong generality
and interpretability, two aspects that remain underexplored in current MTSF
research.

Motivation: 由于动态图数据分布随时间演变，训练好的DGNN在未见测试图上性能存在不确定性，需要评估其适用性

Method: 采用两阶段框架：1) 测试时动态图模拟，捕捉训练-测试分布差异；2) DyGEval开发与训练，准确估计DGNN在测试图上的性能

Result: 大量实验表明DyGEval能有效评估各种DGNN骨干网络在不同分布偏移动态图上的性能

Conclusion: DyGEval为解决动态图神经网络模型评估问题提供了有效解决方案，能在测试时准确评估模型性能

Abstract: Dynamic graph neural networks (DGNNs) have emerged as a leading paradigm for
learning from dynamic graphs, which are commonly used to model real-world
systems and applications. However, due to the evolving nature of dynamic graph
data distributions over time, well-trained DGNNs often face significant
performance uncertainty when inferring on unseen and unlabeled test graphs in
practical deployment. In this case, evaluating the performance of deployed
DGNNs at test time is crucial to determine whether a well-trained DGNN is
suited for inference on an unseen dynamic test graph. In this work, we
introduce a new research problem: DGNN model evaluation, which aims to assess
the performance of a specific DGNN model trained on observed dynamic graphs by
estimating its performance on unseen dynamic graphs during test time.
Specifically, we propose a Dynamic Graph neural network Evaluator, dubbed
DyGEval, to address this new problem. The proposed DyGEval involves a two-stage
framework: (1) test-time dynamic graph simulation, which captures the
training-test distributional differences as supervision signals and trains an
evaluator; and (2) DyGEval development and training, which accurately estimates
the performance of the well-trained DGNN model on the test-time dynamic graphs.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed DyGEval serves as an
effective evaluator for assessing various DGNN backbones across different
dynamic graphs under distribution shifts.

Motivation: 现有生成模型忽略了晶体结构的对称性约束，导致生成的晶体对称性有限且不真实。

Result: 在晶体结构预测和从头生成基准测试中取得了最先进的结果。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效生成高度对称的稳定晶体结构，计算开销可忽略不计。

Abstract: Inorganic crystals are periodic, highly-symmetric arrangements of atoms in
three-dimensional space. Their structures are constrained by the symmetry
operations of a crystallographic \emph{space group} and restricted to lie in
specific affine subspaces known as \emph{Wyckoff positions}. The frequency an
atom appears in the crystal and its rough positioning are determined by its
Wyckoff position. Most generative models that predict atomic coordinates
overlook these symmetry constraints, leading to unrealistically high
populations of proposed crystals exhibiting limited symmetry. We introduce
Space Group Conditional Flow Matching, a novel generative framework that
samples significantly closer to the target population of highly-symmetric,
stable crystals. We achieve this by conditioning the entire generation process
on a given space group and set of Wyckoff positions; specifically, we define a
conditionally symmetric noise base distribution and a group-conditioned,
equivariant, parametric vector field that restricts the motion of atoms to
their initial Wyckoff position. Our form of group-conditioned equivariance is
achieved using an efficient reformulation of \emph{group averaging} tailored
for symmetric crystals. Importantly, it reduces the computational overhead of
symmetrization to a negligible level. We achieve state of the art results on
crystal structure prediction and de novo generation benchmarks. We also perform
relevant ablations.

Abstract: We propose $\textbf{E}$lectric $\textbf{C}$urrent $\textbf{D}$iscrete
$\textbf{D}$ata $\textbf{G}$eneration (ECD$^{2}$G), a pioneering method for
data generation in discrete settings that is grounded in electrical engineering
theory. Our approach draws an analogy between electric current flow in a
circuit and the transfer of probability mass between data distributions. We
interpret samples from the source distribution as current input nodes of a
circuit and samples from the target distribution as current output nodes. A
neural network is then used to learn the electric currents to represent the
probability flow in the circuit. To map the source distribution to the target,
we sample from the source and transport these samples along the circuit
pathways according to the learned currents. This process provably guarantees
transfer between data distributions. We present proof-of-concept experiments to
illustrate our ECD$^{2}$G method.

Method: 系统研究三种方法家族：权重空间、logit空间和选择空间，在路由管道的不同阶段引入原则性不确定性

Result: 在30亿参数MoE模型上的实验表明，该框架显著改善路由稳定性、分布内校准和分布外检测

Conclusion: 通过针对核心架构组件，可以创建更可靠的内部不确定性信号，为构建更鲁棒和自知的LLMs提供实用路径

Abstract: The Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture has enabled the creation of massive
yet efficient Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the standard deterministic
routing mechanism presents a significant limitation: its inherent brittleness
is a key contributor to model miscalibration and overconfidence, resulting in
systems that often do not know what they don't know.
  This thesis confronts this challenge by proposing a structured
\textbf{Bayesian MoE routing framework}. Instead of forcing a single,
deterministic expert selection, our approach models a probability distribution
over the routing decision itself. We systematically investigate three families
of methods that introduce this principled uncertainty at different stages of
the routing pipeline: in the \textbf{weight-space}, the \textbf{logit-space},
and the final \textbf{selection-space}.
  Through a series of controlled experiments on a 3-billion parameter MoE
model, we demonstrate that this framework significantly improves routing
stability, in-distribution calibration, and out-of-distribution (OoD)
detection. The results show that by targeting this core architectural
component, we can create a more reliable internal uncertainty signal. This work
provides a practical and computationally tractable pathway towards building
more robust and self-aware LLMs, taking a crucial step towards making them know
what they don't know.

Result: 在标准基准测试中，AD-RRL相比现有鲁棒RL方法实现了更优越的鲁棒性和性能表现。

Conclusion: AD-RRL通过结合扩散模型和条件风险价值优化，为强化学习的鲁棒性问题提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Robustness to modeling errors and uncertainties remains a central challenge
in reinforcement learning (RL). In this work, we address this challenge by
leveraging diffusion models to train robust RL policies. Diffusion models have
recently gained popularity in model-based RL due to their ability to generate
full trajectories "all at once", mitigating the compounding errors typical of
step-by-step transition models. Moreover, they can be conditioned to sample
from specific distributions, making them highly flexible. We leverage
conditional sampling to learn policies that are robust to uncertainty in
environment dynamics. Building on the established connection between
Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) optimization and robust RL, we introduce
Adversarial Diffusion for Robust Reinforcement Learning (AD-RRL). AD-RRL guides
the diffusion process to generate worst-case trajectories during training,
effectively optimizing the CVaR of the cumulative return. Empirical results
across standard benchmarks show that AD-RRL achieves superior robustness and
performance compared to existing robust RL methods.

Result: DART显著提升了系统效率：1.6倍GPU利用率、1.9倍训练吞吐量和5.5倍环境利用率。在OSWorld基准上，DART-GUI-7B达到42.13%的任务成功率，比基础模型提升14.61%，比开源SOTA高7.34%。

Conclusion: DART框架通过解耦设计和自适应数据管理有效解决了GUI代理强化学习的效率和数据质量问题，为开源社区提供了高效的代理强化学习训练方案。

Abstract: Vision-language model (VLM) based GUI agents show promise for automating
complex desktop and mobile tasks, but face significant challenges in applying
reinforcement learning (RL): (1) slow multi-turn interactions with GUI
environments for policy rollout, and (2) insufficient high-quality
agent-environment interactions for policy learning. To address these
challenges, we propose DART, a Decoupled Agentic RL Training framework for GUI
agents, which coordinates heterogeneous modules in a highly decoupled manner.
DART separates the training system into four asynchronous modules: environment
cluster, rollout service, data manager, and trainer. This design enables
non-blocking communication, asynchronous training, rollout-wise trajectory
sampling, and per-worker model synchronization, significantly improving the
system efficiency: 1.6*GPU utilization for rollout, 1.9* training throughput,
and 5.5* environment utilization. To facilitate effective learning from
abundant samples, we introduce an adaptive data curation scheme: (1)
pre-collecting successful trajectories for challenging tasks to supplement
sparse success in online sampling; (2) dynamically adjusting rollout numbers
and trajectory lengths based on task difficulty; (3) training selectively on
high-entropy steps to prioritize critical decisions; (4) stabilizing learning
via truncated importance sampling for policy mismatch between policy rollout
and updating. On the OSWorld benchmark, DART-GUI-7B achieves a 42.13% task
success rate, a 14.61% absolute gain over the base model, and 7.34% higher than
open-source SOTA. We will fully open-source our training framework, data, and
model checkpoints via computer-use-agents.github.io/dart-gui, which we believe
is a timely contribution to the open-source community of agentic RL training.

### [613] [Towards Understanding Subliminal Learning: When and How Hidden Biases Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23886)
*Simon Schrodi,Elias Kempf,Fazl Barez,Thomas Brox*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 语言模型在蒸馏过程中可以传递隐藏偏见，这种现象称为潜意识学习。研究发现潜意识学习不需要全局标记纠缠或logit泄漏，而是由一小部分分歧标记驱动，这些标记在具有不同偏见的教师模型下会产生不同的预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究语言模型蒸馏过程中隐藏偏见传递的机制，特别是解释为何在硬蒸馏（学生只看到采样标记）中也会发生潜意识学习现象。

Method: 通过控制实验和机制分析，识别分歧标记的作用，并测试屏蔽这些标记、微调特定层等方法对潜意识学习的影响。

Result: 分歧标记是潜意识学习的关键，屏蔽它们基本能消除隐藏偏见传递。早期层对潜意识学习至关重要，仅微调单个早期层就足以实现潜意识学习。潜意识学习很脆弱，简单的提示改写就能抑制它。

Conclusion: 潜意识学习的机制比预期更简单，主要由分歧标记和早期层驱动，且这种学习方式容易受到干扰。

Abstract: Language models can transfer hidden biases during distillation. For example,
a teacher that "likes owls" can make its student "like owls" too, even when the
training data consists only of lists of numbers. This surprising phenomenon is
called subliminal learning. Subliminal learning can be expected under soft
distillation, where the student is trained on the teacher's full next-token
distribution. But the fact that this also occurs under hard distillation-where
the student only sees sampled tokens-raises a deeper question: when and how
does subliminal learning actually occur? We answer this question through
controlled experiments and mechanistic analysis. Our results show that
subliminal learning does not need (global) token entanglement or logit leakage.
Instead, it comes down to a small set of divergence tokens-rare cases where
teachers with different biases would predict different tokens. Masking out
these tokens mostly removes the hidden bias transfer. Mechanistically,
divergence tokens reveal that early layers are critical. Surprisingly,
finetuning even a single such early layer is sufficient for subliminal
learning. Finally, we find that subliminal learning is fragile. Even small
changes, like paraphrasing prompts, are usually sufficient to suppress it.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个统一的理论，证明在使用分段非零多项式激活函数或ReLU、sigmoid激活函数的任何神经网络中，连续梯度下降（梯度流）都能实现线性收敛。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代深度学习理论面临的关键挑战是解释基于梯度的优化方法在训练大规模复杂深度神经网络时的显著成功。虽然已经为少数特定架构证明了线性收敛，但统一的理论仍然缺乏。

Method: 提出了一个统一证明，适用于任何具有分段非零多项式激活函数或ReLU、sigmoid激活函数的神经网络。主要贡献是一个单一通用定理，不仅覆盖了先前未知结果的架构，还在更弱假设下整合了现有结果。

Result: 该理论结果在无穷小步长极限下是精确的，但在实际步长的梯度下降方法中，理论预测与经验结果表现出极好的一致性。

Conclusion: 这项工作为理解梯度下降在深度神经网络训练中的收敛行为提供了统一的理论框架，填补了现有理论的空白。

Abstract: A key challenge in modern deep learning theory is to explain the remarkable
success of gradient-based optimization methods when training large-scale,
complex deep neural networks. Though linear convergence of such methods has
been proved for a handful of specific architectures, a united theory still
evades researchers. This article presents a unified proof for linear
convergence of continuous gradient descent, also called gradient flow, while
training any neural network with piecewise non-zero polynomial activations or
ReLU, sigmoid activations. Our primary contribution is a single, general
theorem that not only covers architectures for which this result was previously
unknown but also consolidates existing results under weaker assumptions. While
our focus is theoretical and our results are only exact in the infinitesimal
step size limit, we nevertheless find excellent empirical agreement between the
predictions of our result and those of the practical step-size gradient descent
method.

*Zhixin Zhang,Zeming Wei,Meng Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出动态正交持续微调(DOC)方法，通过追踪功能方向漂移并动态更新，调整新任务梯度与历史功能方向正交，有效缓解LLM持续学习中的灾难性遗忘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于正则化的方法在长期LLM持续学习中失败的主要原因是微调过程中功能方向的漂移，导致模型难以在历史任务上保持性能。

Method: DOC方法追踪功能方向的漂移并在微调过程中动态更新，同时调整新任务参数梯度使其与追踪的历史功能方向正交，从而减少新旧任务间的干扰。

Result: 在多种LLM持续学习基准测试上的广泛实验表明，该方法优于先前方法，有效减少灾难性遗忘。

Conclusion: DOC方法为持续LLM微调提供了一个强大的工具，通过动态正交化机制成功缓解了灾难性遗忘问题。

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting remains a critical challenge in continual learning
for large language models (LLMs), where models struggle to retain performance
on historical tasks when fine-tuning on new sequential data without access to
past datasets. In this paper, we first reveal that the drift of functional
directions during the fine-tuning process is a key reason why existing
regularization-based methods fail in long-term LLM continual learning. To
address this, we propose Dynamic Orthogonal Continual (DOC) fine-tuning, a
novel approach that tracks the drift of these functional directions and
dynamically updates them during the fine-tuning process. Furthermore, by
adjusting the gradients of new task parameters to be orthogonal to the tracked
historical function directions, our method mitigates interference between new
and old tasks. Extensive experiments on various LLM continual learning
benchmarks demonstrate that this approach outperforms prior methods,
effectively reducing catastrophic forgetting and providing a robust tool for
continuous LLM fine-tuning. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出D-Gating方法，通过完全可微的结构化过参数化实现神经网络的结构化稀疏化，理论证明与L2,2/D正则化等价，在视觉、语言和表格任务中表现优异


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 结构化稀疏正则化能有效压缩神经网络，但其不可微性导致与标准随机梯度下降不兼容，需要专门优化器或后处理剪枝，缺乏理论保证

Method: D-Gating方法将每组权重分解为主权重向量和多个标量门控因子，实现完全可微的结构化过参数化

Result: 理论证明D-Gating的局部极小值也是L2,2/D正则化的局部极小值，在梯度流极限下以指数速度收敛到正则化损失，实验验证在多个任务中优于直接优化和传统剪枝方法

Conclusion: D-Gating在理论上等价于原始群稀疏问题，但诱导了从非稀疏到稀疏优化的独特学习动态，实现了优异的性能-稀疏度权衡

Abstract: Structured sparsity regularization offers a principled way to compact neural
networks, but its non-differentiability breaks compatibility with conventional
stochastic gradient descent and requires either specialized optimizers or
additional post-hoc pruning without formal guarantees. In this work, we propose
$D$-Gating, a fully differentiable structured overparameterization that splits
each group of weights into a primary weight vector and multiple scalar gating
factors. We prove that any local minimum under $D$-Gating is also a local
minimum using non-smooth structured $L_{2,2/D}$ penalization, and further show
that the $D$-Gating objective converges at least exponentially fast to the
$L_{2,2/D}$-regularized loss in the gradient flow limit. Together, our results
show that $D$-Gating is theoretically equivalent to solving the original group
sparsity problem, yet induces distinct learning dynamics that evolve from a
non-sparse regime into sparse optimization. We validate our theory across
vision, language, and tabular tasks, where $D$-Gating consistently delivers
strong performance-sparsity tradeoffs and outperforms both direct optimization
of structured penalties and conventional pruning baselines.

Motivation: 复杂地理环境导致无线信道条件不可预测且高度动态，造成空地链路频繁中断，严重制约无人机群辅助移动通信的可靠性和服务质量。

Method: 将联合资源分配和3D轨迹控制问题建模为马尔可夫决策过程，开发多智能体强化学习框架，提出带有动作掩码的多智能体混合近端策略优化算法来处理复杂的混合动作空间。

Conclusion: 所提出的集成通信与控制协同设计机制能有效提升复杂地理环境中无人机群辅助通信的质量，在保证公平性的同时显著降低能耗。

Abstract: The deployment of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm-assisted communication
networks has become an increasingly vital approach for remediating coverage
limitations in infrastructure-deficient environments, with especially pressing
applications in temporary scenarios, such as emergency rescue, military and
security operations, and remote area coverage. However, complex geographic
environments lead to unpredictable and highly dynamic wireless channel
conditions, resulting in frequent interruptions of air-to-ground (A2G) links
that severely constrain the reliability and quality of service in UAV
swarm-assisted mobile communications. To improve the quality of UAV
swarm-assisted communications in complex geographic environments, we propose an
integrated communication and control co-design mechanism. Given the stringent
energy constraints inherent in UAV swarms, our proposed mechanism is designed
to optimize energy efficiency while maintaining an equilibrium between
equitable communication rates for mobile ground users (GUs) and UAV energy
expenditure. We formulate the joint resource allocation and 3D trajectory
control problem as a Markov decision process (MDP), and develop a multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL) framework to enable real-time coordinated actions
across the UAV swarm. To optimize the action policy of UAV swarms, we propose a
novel multi-agent hybrid proximal policy optimization with action masking
(MAHPPO-AM) algorithm, specifically designed to handle complex hybrid action
spaces. The algorithm incorporates action masking to enforce hard constraints
in high-dimensional action spaces. Experimental results demonstrate that our
approach achieves a fairness index of 0.99 while reducing energy consumption by
up to 25% compared to baseline methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理稀疏时间序列数据时缺乏可解释性，GMAN旨在提供既能保持高性能又能提供领域对齐解释的解决方案。

Method: 将每个时间相关轨迹表示为有向图，应用增强的GNAN到每个图上，通过特征和图分组来控制可解释性与表达能力的权衡。

Result: 在真实世界数据集(包括血液检测死亡率预测和假新闻检测)上，GMAN优于强大的非可解释黑盒基线方法，同时提供可操作的领域对齐解释。

Conclusion: GMAN框架成功地在保持高性能的同时提供了多层次的可解释性，证明了在医疗和假新闻检测等关键应用中可解释AI的可行性。

Abstract: We introduce GMAN, a flexible, interpretable, and expressive framework that
extends Graph Neural Additive Networks (GNANs) to learn from sets of sparse
time-series data. GMAN represents each time-dependent trajectory as a directed
graph and applies an enriched, more expressive GNAN to each graph. It allows
users to control the interpretability-expressivity trade-off by grouping
features and graphs to encode priors, and it provides feature, node, and
graph-level interpretability. On real-world datasets, including mortality
prediction from blood tests and fake-news detection, GMAN outperforms strong
non-interpretable black-box baselines while delivering actionable,
domain-aligned explanations.

*Zhinan Xie,Peisong Wang,Jian Cheng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HiViS是一种用于加速视觉语言模型推理的推测解码方法，通过将视觉token从草稿器中移除，仅保留文本token作为显式输入，同时重用目标VLM的隐藏状态作为隐式视觉信息，显著减少了预填充序列长度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推测解码在大型语言模型中有效加速推理，但在视觉语言模型中面临挑战，因为额外的视觉token会导致语义表示不对齐和自注意力计算缓慢。

Method: 提出显式-隐式输入分解框架，从草稿器输入中移除所有视觉token，仅保留文本token作为显式输入，直接重用目标VLM的隐藏状态作为隐式视觉信息，并采用多步自反馈训练策略。

Result: 将草稿器的预填充序列长度压缩到目标VLM输入的0.7%-1.3%，同时保持无损生成质量，在多样化模型和任务中实现最高2.65倍的加速。

Conclusion: HiViS通过有效处理视觉token，在保持生成质量的同时显著加速了视觉语言模型的推理过程。

Abstract: Speculative decoding is an effective approach for accelerating inference in
Large Language models (LLMs), but its adaptation to Vision-Language models
(VLMs) remains challenging for additional visual tokens in multimodal inputs.
First, owing to the fact that the drafter and the target VLM may derived from
different families, the semantic representations of visual tokens in the target
VLM are misaligned with those in the drafter, introducing bias into the
KV-cache during the prefill stage. Second, the large number of visual tokens
substantially slows down the drafter's self-attention during the decoding
stage. We propose Hiding Visual Tokens from the Drafter for Speculative
Decoding in Vision-Language Models (HiViS), an explicit-implicit input
decomposition framework that alleviates the above inefficiency. All visual
tokens are removed from the drafter's input, retaining only textual tokens as
explicit inputs, while directly reusing the target VLM's corresponding
last-layer hidden states as implicit visual information without additional
processing. To train the drafter efficiently, we introduces multi-step
self-feedback training strategy with dynamic data selection and sequential
embedding supervision to simulate reasoning during training. Our approach
compresses the prefill sequence length of the drafter to only 0.7%-1.3% of the
target VLM's input, while maintaining lossless generation quality. Extensive
experiments across diverse models and tasks demonstrate up to 2.65x speedup,
confirming the effectiveness of HiViS in accelerating VLM inference.

TL;DR: 该论文通过引入MUI指标系统分析了MoE架构的内部机制，发现了神经元利用率随模型演进下降、训练动态轨迹、多专家协作完成任务以及神经元激活模式反映数据多样性等重要发现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前MoE架构研究主要关注性能表现，对其内部机制理解有限，这限制了该领域的进一步发展。

Method: 使用内部指标MUI来研究MoE架构，明确纳入路由机制并分析专家级行为，系统分析了大量公开可用的MoE模型。

Result: 发现神经元利用率随模型演进下降反映更强泛化能力；训练呈现动态轨迹；任务完成来自多专家协作；神经元激活模式可作为数据多样性的细粒度代理。

Conclusion: MUI可作为基准性能的补充指标，为理解MoE模型的容量、动态性和专业化提供新视角。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures have emerged as a promising direction,
offering efficiency and scalability by activating only a subset of parameters
during inference. However, current research remains largely
performance-centric, with limited understanding of its internal mechanisms,
thereby constraining broader progress. In this work, we use an internal metric
to investigate the mechanisms of MoE architecture by explicitly incorporating
routing mechanisms and analyzing expert-level behaviors. Through systematic
analyses of a wide range of publicly available MoE models, we uncover several
findings: (1) neuron utilization decreases as models evolve, reflecting
stronger generalization; (2) training exhibits a dynamic trajectory, where
benchmark performance alone provides limited signal while MUI reveals deeper
insights; (3) task completion emerges from collaborative contributions of
multiple experts, with shared experts driving concentration; and (4) activation
patterns at the neuron level provide a fine-grained proxy for data diversity.
Together, these results demonstrate the potential of MUI as a complementary
indicator to benchmark performance, offering new insights into the capacity,
dynamics, and specialization of MoE models. Our project can be found at

Method: 通过理论分析建立扩散模型与凯利准则的数学联系，分析条件扩散模型中的互信息存储机制，并研究分类器引导在采样过程中的作用。

Result: 发现条件扩散模型存储的额外信息等于X和Y之间的互信息，分类器引导能有效提升采样时的互信息，这对图像模型特别重要，因为图像与标签的互信息通常较低。

Conclusion: 扩散模型与凯利准则存在深刻联系，分类器引导通过提升互信息改善生成质量，同时指出了将扩散模型视为无限深度自编码器观点的细微差别，并将去噪损失与量子力学中的费米黄金法则联系起来。

Abstract: We draw a connection between diffusion models and the Kelly criterion for
maximizing returns in betting games. We find that conditional diffusion models
store additional information to bind the signal $X$ with the conditioning
information $Y$, equal to the mutual information between them. Classifier-free
guidance effectively boosts the mutual information between $X$ and $Y$ at
sampling time. This is especially helpful in image models, since the mutual
information between images and their labels is low, a fact which is intimately
connected to the manifold hypothesis. Finally, we point out some nuances in the
popular perspective that diffusion models are infinitely deep autoencoders. In
doing so, we relate the denoising loss to the Fermi Golden Rule from quantum
mechanics.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized human-machine interaction,
and have been extended by embedding diverse modalities such as images into a
shared language space. Yet, neural decoding has remained constrained by static,
non-interactive methods. We introduce CorText, a framework that integrates
neural activity directly into the latent space of an LLM, enabling open-ended,
natural language interaction with brain data. Trained on fMRI data recorded
during viewing of natural scenes, CorText generates accurate image captions and
can answer more detailed questions better than controls, while having access to
neural data only. We showcase that CorText achieves zero-shot generalization
beyond semantic categories seen during training. Furthermore, we present a
counterfactual analysis that emulates in-silico cortical microstimulation.
These advances mark a shift from passive decoding toward generative, flexible
interfaces between brain activity and language.

Conclusion: 该框架为大规模地理空间分析提供了一个实用的解决方案，能够在满足用户定义的精度和召回要求的同时，高效识别具有最高空间相似度的聚类。

Abstract: Advancements in tools like Shapely 2.0 and Triton can significantly improve
the efficiency of spatial similarity computations by enabling faster and more
scalable geometric operations. However, for extremely large datasets, these
optimizations may face challenges due to the sheer volume of computations
required. To address this, we propose a framework that reduces the number of
clusters requiring verification, thereby decreasing the computational load on
these systems. The framework integrates dynamic similarity index thresholding,
supervised scheduling, and recall-constrained optimization to efficiently
identify clusters with the highest spatial similarity while meeting
user-defined precision and recall requirements. By leveraging Kernel Density
Estimation (KDE) to dynamically determine similarity thresholds and machine
learning models to prioritize clusters, our approach achieves substantial
reductions in computational cost without sacrificing accuracy. Experimental
results demonstrate the scalability and effectiveness of the method, offering a
practical solution for large-scale geospatial analysis.

TL;DR: 提出Explore-Execute Chain (E²C)框架，将推理分解为探索阶段（生成高层计划）和执行阶段（执行选定计划），通过两阶段训练方法显著提高计算效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Chain-of-Thought方法将高层战略规划与低层逐步执行混为一体，导致计算效率低下、推理路径探索有限和可解释性降低。

Method: 采用两阶段训练方法：监督微调（SFT）增强严格计划遵循，随后强化学习（RL）阶段利用探索信息并强化执行确定性。

Result: 在AIME'2024上，E²C测试时扩展达到58.1%准确率，仅使用不到10%的解码token；在医疗基准上，EF-SFT仅使用3.5%的token却比标准SFT准确率高14.5%。

Conclusion: E²C框架通过分离规划与执行，实现了最先进的性能、强大的泛化能力和更高的可解释性，同时大幅降低计算开销。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and its variants have markedly advanced the reasoning
abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet their monolithic and
auto-regressive architecture inherently conflates high-level strategic planning
with low-level step-by-step execution, leading to computational inefficiency,
limited exploration of reasoning paths, and reduced interpretability. To
overcome these issues, we propose the Explore-Execute Chain ($E^2C$), a
structured reasoning framework that decouples reasoning into two distinct
phases: an exploratory phase that stochastically generates succinct high-level
plans, followed by an execution phase that deterministically carries out the
chosen plan. Our approach incorporates a two-stage training methodology, which
combines Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) - augmented by a novel data generation
algorithm enforcing strict plan adherence - with a subsequent Reinforcement
Learning (RL) stage that capitalizes on the informativeness of exploration and
reinforces the determinism of execution.This decomposition enables an efficient
test-time scaling strategy: on AIME'2024, $E^2C$ Test Time Scaling reaches
58.1% accuracy using <10% of the decoding tokens required by comparable methods
(e.g., Forest-of-Thought), sharply cutting self-consistency overhead. For
cross-domain adaptation, our Exploration-Focused SFT (EF-SFT) fine-tunes with
only 3.5% of the tokens used by standard SFT yet yields up to 14.5% higher
accuracy than standard SFT on medical benchmarks, delivering state-of-the-art
performance, strong generalization, and greater interpretability by separating
planning from execution. The code and pre-trained models for the project are

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了DiBS-MTL方法，一种基于方向性谈判解的多任务学习算法，能够抵抗任务损失的非仿射单调变换，避免任务主导问题，并在非凸设置下收敛到帕累托稳定点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多任务学习方法通过加权平均组合任务损失或梯度，但任务损失的任意非仿射缩放会导致某些任务主导训练，降低整体性能。需要一种对单调非仿射变换不变的方法来解决这个问题。

Method: 基于合作博弈理论中的方向性谈判解(DiBS)，开发了DiBS-MTL算法。该方法在非凸多任务学习设置下具有收敛保证，计算效率高，且对任务损失的单调非仿射变换具有不变性。

Result: 在标准多任务学习基准测试中，DiBS-MTL与最先进方法性能相当，同时对显著降低现有方法性能的非仿射单调变换保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: DiBS-MTL是一种有效的多任务学习方法，能够避免任务主导问题，在非凸设置下收敛，并对任务损失的缩放具有鲁棒性，优于现有的谈判启发式多任务学习方法。

Abstract: Multitask learning (MTL) algorithms typically rely on schemes that combine
different task losses or their gradients through weighted averaging. These
methods aim to find Pareto stationary points by using heuristics that require
access to task loss values, gradients, or both. In doing so, a central
challenge arises because task losses can be arbitrarily, nonaffinely scaled
relative to one another, causing certain tasks to dominate training and degrade
overall performance. A recent advance in cooperative bargaining theory, the
Direction-based Bargaining Solution (DiBS), yields Pareto stationary solutions
immune to task domination because of its invariance to monotonic nonaffine task
loss transformations. However, the convergence behavior of DiBS in nonconvex
MTL settings is currently not understood. To this end, we prove that under
standard assumptions, a subsequence of DiBS iterates converges to a Pareto
stationary point when task losses are possibly nonconvex, and propose DiBS-MTL,
a computationally efficient adaptation of DiBS to the MTL setting. Finally, we
validate DiBS-MTL empirically on standard MTL benchmarks, showing that it
achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art methods while
maintaining robustness to nonaffine monotonic transformations that

### [626] [Evaluating the Robustness of Chinchilla Compute-Optimal Scaling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23963)
*Rylan Schaeffer,Noam Levi,Andreas Kirsch,Theo Guenais,Brando Miranda,Elyas Obbad,Sanmi Koyejo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究重新评估了Chinchilla论文的计算最优缩放原则，发现尽管存在参数定义模糊等问题，但其核心结论仍然可靠，为语言模型缩放提供了可信指导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对Chinchilla论文提出的计算最优缩放原则在后续研究中受到质疑（如宽置信区间、方法间差异等问题），需要验证这些原则是否仍然可靠。

Method: 首先识别Chinchilla分析中模型参数的三种可能解释，然后通过四种结构化方式故意扰动模型参数，评估关键结果的稳健性。

Result: 发现模型参数的不同解释对关键结果影响不大；即使参数受到显著扰动，Chinchilla的核心结果（缩放定律估计和最优token-参数比）仍保持稳健。

Conclusion: Chinchilla的计算最优缩放原则具有持久性，可以为语言模型缩放提供可靠指导，增强了该领域对此原则的信心。

Abstract: Hoffman et al (2022)'s Chinchilla paper introduced the principle of
compute-optimal scaling, laying a foundation for future scaling of language
models. In the years since, however, valid concerns about Chinchilla have been
raised: wide confidence intervals, discrepancies between its three approaches,
and incongruities with other scaling laws. This raises a critical question for
the field: Can practitioners still rely on Chinchilla's prescriptions? Our work
demonstrates the answer is yes. We begin by uncovering that the model
parameters central to Chinchilla's analyses were ambiguous: three
interpretations are possible, with relative differences between different
interpretations of model parameters as high as 15.2%. We find that, perhaps
surprisingly, which model parameters are used for the analyses do not
meaningfully affect key results: the scaling law estimates and the
compute-optimal tokens-to-parameter ratio. Indeed, under one interpretation,
the tokens-to-parameter ratio becomes more constant with the target compute
budget. We then ask how distorted the Chinchilla model parameters could have
been without meaningfully affecting the key results. By deliberately perturbing
model parameters in four structured ways, we find that key Chinchilla results
are most sensitive to additive or systematic errors, which can alter the
otherwise flat trend of the optimal tokens-to-parameter ratio, but overall,
Chinchilla's key results withstand sizable perturbations. Altogether, our
findings offer the field renewed confidence in Chinchilla as a durable guide
for scaling language models.

TL;DR: 提出了一种利用神经网络倒数第二层特征进行标签错误检测和校正的后处理、模型无关方法，基于错误标签样本与其真实类别的特征相似性原理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着深度网络规模增大，对自动检测数据集标签错误的需求日益增长，因为标签噪声会损害神经网络训练性能。

Method: 利用神经网络倒数第二层特征，通过观察错误标签数据点与其真实类别数据点的特征相似性高于其他类别的现象，使用紧密相似簇中的标签出现概率来检测和校正错误。

Result: 大量实验表明该方法在各种噪声类型下都表现出高性能，并能自动校正错误以提高数据集质量。

Conclusion: 基于倒数第二层特征相似性的方法能够有效检测和校正数据集中的标签错误，提升数据集质量。

Abstract: Label noise in datasets could damage the performance of neural net training.
As the size of modern deep networks grows, there is a growing demand for
automated tools for detecting such errors. In this paper, we propose post-hoc,
model-agnostic error detection and rectification methods utilizing the
penultimate feature from a neural network. Our idea is based on the observation
that the similarity between the penultimate feature of a mislabeled data point
and its true class data points is higher than that for data points from other
classes, making the probability of label occurrence within a tight, similar
cluster informative for detecting and rectifying errors. Extensive experiments
show our method not only demonstrates high performance across various noises
but also automatically rectifies these errors to improve the quality of
datasets.

TL;DR: 提出基于强化学习的框架，直接从CDM规范生成功能正确且gas优化的Solidity智能合约，实现高达35.59%的gas成本降低


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 金融衍生品智能合约自动化虽能带来效率提升，但将金融规范转换为gas高效可执行代码的复杂性限制了实际应用，特别是从高级规范生成功能正确且经济可行的代码仍是重大挑战

Method: 使用近端策略优化(PPO)强化学习代理，从预定义库中选择最优代码片段，采用两阶段课程学习：先训练功能正确性，再聚焦gas优化

Result: RL代理学会生成显著节省gas的合约，在未见测试数据上相比未优化基线实现高达35.59%的成本降低

Conclusion: 这项工作为自动合成可靠且经济可持续的智能合约提供了可行方法，弥合了高级金融协议与高效链上执行之间的差距

Abstract: Smart contract-based automation of financial derivatives offers substantial
efficiency gains, but its real-world adoption is constrained by the complexity
of translating financial specifications into gas-efficient executable code. In
particular, generating code that is both functionally correct and economically
viable from high-level specifications, such as the Common Domain Model (CDM),
remains a significant challenge. This paper introduces a Reinforcement Learning
(RL) framework to generate functional and gas-optimized Solidity smart
contracts directly from CDM specifications. We employ a Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO) agent that learns to select optimal code snippets from a
pre-defined library. To manage the complex search space, a two-phase curriculum
first trains the agent for functional correctness before shifting its focus to
gas optimization. Our empirical results show the RL agent learns to generate
contracts with significant gas savings, achieving cost reductions of up to
35.59% on unseen test data compared to unoptimized baselines. This work
presents a viable methodology for the automated synthesis of reliable and
economically sustainable smart contracts, bridging the gap between high-level
financial agreements and efficient on-chain execution.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出GUIDE框架，通过整合LLM生成的邻接矩阵和观测数据，解决了现有因果发现方法在可扩展性、计算效率和混合数据类型适应性方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有因果发现方法（如PC、GES、ICA-LiNGAM）在节点可扩展性（超过70个节点）、计算能耗和混合数据类型处理方面存在严重限制，需要更高效、可扩展的解决方案。

Method: GUIDE采用双编码器架构，将LLM生成的邻接矩阵与观测数据集成，并通过强化学习代理动态平衡奖励最大化（准确性）和惩罚避免（DAG约束）。

Result: 相比RL-BIC和KCRL方法，GUIDE平均减少约42%的运行时间；相比NOTEARS和GraN-DAG，平均提高约117%的准确性，并能扩展到70个以上节点。

Conclusion: GUIDE框架在计算效率、准确性和可扩展性方面显著优于现有方法，特别是在处理混合数据类型和大规模节点场景下表现优异。

Abstract: Modern causal discovery methods face critical limitations in scalability,
computational efficiency, and adaptability to mixed data types, as evidenced by
benchmarks on node scalability (30, $\le 50$, $\ge 70$ nodes), computational
energy demands, and continuous/non-continuous data handling. While traditional
algorithms like PC, GES, and ICA-LiNGAM struggle with these challenges,
exhibiting prohibitive energy costs for higher-order nodes and poor scalability
beyond 70 nodes, we propose \textbf{GUIDE}, a framework that integrates Large
Language Model (LLM)-generated adjacency matrices with observational data
through a dual-encoder architecture. GUIDE uniquely optimizes computational
efficiency, reducing runtime on average by $\approx 42%$ compared to RL-BIC and
KCRL methods, while achieving an average $\approx 117%$ improvement in accuracy
over both NOTEARS and GraN-DAG individually. During training, GUIDE's
reinforcement learning agent dynamically balances reward maximization
(accuracy) and penalty avoidance (DAG constraints), enabling robust performance
across mixed data types and scalability to $\ge 70$ nodes -- a setting where
baseline methods fail.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文研究了弱到强泛化中的关键问题：当使用带有伪标签的弱教师模型微调强预训练学生模型时，在存在虚假相关性的下游任务中，弱到强泛化是否会发生以及如何改进失败情况。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究弱到强泛化在存在群体不平衡导致的虚假相关性时的表现，特别关注当标记数据和未标记数据的少数群体比例不同时，弱到强泛化可能失败的情况。

Method: 理论分析在比例渐近极限下精确刻画弱到强泛化增益，并通过在各种虚假相关性基准和师生模型对上进行的广泛实验验证理论。提出一种简单有效的算法补救措施：在弱到强微调后，重新训练强学生模型在其高置信度数据子集上。

Result: 理论表明当未标记数据和标记数据的少数群体比例相同时，弱到强泛化总是发生；但当比例不同时，弱到强泛化可能失败，其增益随比例差异的平方而减小。实验验证了理论结果，提出的算法在弱到强微调失败时实现了持续显著的改进。

Conclusion: 弱到强泛化在群体不平衡导致的虚假相关性设置中可能失败，特别是在标记数据和未标记数据的少数群体比例不同时。提出的无需群体标签的算法能有效提升弱到强泛化性能。

Abstract: We initiate a unified theoretical and algorithmic study of a key problem in
weak-to-strong (W2S) generalization: when fine-tuning a strong pre-trained
student with pseudolabels from a weaker teacher on a downstream task with
spurious correlations, does W2S happen, and how to improve it upon failures? We
consider two sources of spurious correlations caused by group imbalance: (i) a
weak teacher fine-tuned on group-imbalanced labeled data with a minority group
of fraction $\eta_\ell$, and (ii) a group-imbalanced unlabeled set
pseudolabeled by the teacher with a minority group of fraction $\eta_u$.
Theoretically, a precise characterization of W2S gain at the proportional
asymptotic limit shows that W2S always happens with sufficient pseudolabels
when $\eta_u = \eta_\ell$ but may fail when $\eta_u \ne \eta_\ell$, where W2S
gain diminishes as $(\eta_u - \eta_\ell)^2$ increases. Our theory is
corroborated by extensive experiments on various spurious correlation
benchmarks and teacher-student pairs. To boost W2S performance upon failures,
we further propose a simple, effective algorithmic remedy that retrains the
strong student on its high-confidence data subset after W2S fine-tuning. Our
algorithm is group-label-free and achieves consistent, substantial improvements
over vanilla W2S fine-tuning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出SLA（稀疏线性注意力）方法，通过融合稀疏和线性注意力来加速扩散模型中的注意力计算，将注意力权重分为关键、边缘和可忽略三类，分别应用O(N²)、O(N)计算或跳过，实现20倍注意力计算减少和显著加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在扩散变换器（DiT）模型中，特别是视频生成场景下，注意力延迟是主要瓶颈，因为序列长度长且注意力具有二次复杂度。研究发现注意力权重可以分为两部分：少量高秩的大权重和大量低秩的剩余权重。

Method: 提出SLA方法，将注意力权重分类为关键、边缘和可忽略三类，分别应用O(N²)标准注意力、O(N)线性注意力和跳过计算。将这些计算融合到单个GPU内核中，支持前向和反向传播，并通过少量微调步骤实现加速。

Result: SLA将注意力计算减少95%，在Wan2.1-1.3B模型上实现13.7倍注意力计算加速和2.2倍端到端视频生成加速，且不降低生成质量。

Conclusion: SLA通过融合稀疏和线性注意力，有效解决了DiT模型中注意力计算瓶颈，在保持生成质量的同时实现了显著的加速效果。

Abstract: In Diffusion Transformer (DiT) models, particularly for video generation,
attention latency is a major bottleneck due to the long sequence length and the
quadratic complexity. We find that attention weights can be separated into two
parts: a small fraction of large weights with high rank and the remaining
weights with very low rank. This naturally suggests applying sparse
acceleration to the first part and low-rank acceleration to the second. Based
on this finding, we propose SLA (Sparse-Linear Attention), a trainable
attention method that fuses sparse and linear attention to accelerate diffusion
models. SLA classifies attention weights into critical, marginal, and
negligible categories, applying O(N^2) attention to critical weights, O(N)
attention to marginal weights, and skipping negligible ones. SLA combines these
computations into a single GPU kernel and supports both forward and backward
passes. With only a few fine-tuning steps using SLA, DiT models achieve a 20x
reduction in attention computation, resulting in significant acceleration
without loss of generation quality. Experiments show that SLA reduces attention
computation by 95% without degrading end-to-end generation quality,
outperforming baseline methods. In addition, we implement an efficient GPU
kernel for SLA, which yields a 13.7x speedup in attention computation and a
2.2x end-to-end speedup in video generation on Wan2.1-1.3B.

TL;DR: 本文提出了三种不同的预训练缩放定律来拟合生成式评估中的pass-at-k指标，并预测昂贵模型的性能。研究发现这些缩放定律在不同k值下表现相当，并建立了计算缩放定律与参数-标记缩放定律之间的理论联系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然已有大量研究针对预训练损失和判别式评估的缩放定律，但针对生成式评估（如数学问题解决、软件工程）的缩放定律研究相对较少。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 提出了三种预训练缩放定律：(1) 基于计算量的缩放定律；(2) 基于模型参数和标记数量的缩放定律；(3) 基于黄金参考解对数似然的缩放定律。通过控制超参数k来研究缩放定律的参数稳定性和预测性能。

Result: (1) 生成式评估提供了新的超参数k来控制缩放定律参数和性能可预测性；(2) 计算缩放定律和参数+标记缩放定律在最后1.5-2.5个数量级稳定，而黄金参考似然缩放定律在最后5个数量级稳定；(3) 三种缩放定律预测性能相当，但计算缩放定律在小k时预测稍差，黄金参考似然在大k时预测稍差；(4) 建立了计算缩放定律作为参数-标记缩放定律计算最优包络的理论联系。

Conclusion: 该框架为研究人员和从业者提供了预测生成性能的见解和方法论，有助于更好地理解和预测生成式模型的性能扩展规律。

Abstract: Neural scaling laws have played a central role in modern machine learning,
driving the field's ever-expanding scaling of parameters, data and compute.
While much research has gone into fitting scaling laws and predicting
performance on pretraining losses and on discriminative evaluations such as
multiple-choice question-answering, comparatively little research has been done
on fitting scaling laws and predicting performance on generative evaluations
such as mathematical problem-solving or software engineering. We propose and
evaluate three different pretraining scaling laws for fitting pass-at-$k$ on
generative evaluations and for predicting pass-at-$k$ of the most expensive
model using the performance of cheaper models. Our three scaling laws differ in
the covariates used: (1) compute, (2) model parameters and tokens, (3) log
likelihoods of gold reference solutions. We make four main contributions: (1)
We show how generative evaluations offer new hyperparameters (in our setting,
$k$) that researchers can use to control the scaling laws parameters and the
predictability of performance. (2) In terms of scaling law parameters, we find
that the compute scaling law and parameters\,+\,tokens scaling law stabilize
for the last ~$1.5{-}2.5$ orders of magnitude, whereas the gold reference
likelihood scaling law stabilizes for the last ~$5$ orders of magnitude. (3) In
terms of predictive performance, we find all three scaling laws perform
comparably, although the compute scaling law predicts slightly worse for small
$k$ and the log likelihoods of gold reference solutions predicts slightly worse
for large $k$. (4) We establish a theoretical connection that the compute
scaling law emerges as the compute-optimal envelope of the
parameters-and-tokens scaling law. Our framework provides researchers and
practitioners with insights and methodologies to forecast generative
performance.

TL;DR: GPS-MTM是一个用于大规模移动数据的轨迹建模基础模型，通过分解移动行为为状态和动作两个模态，使用双向Transformer和掩码建模目标来学习丰富的语义关联，在轨迹填充和下一站预测等任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: GPS-MTM被确立为轨迹分析的稳健基础模型，将移动数据定位为大规模表示学习的一流模态。代码已发布供进一步参考。

Abstract: Foundation models have driven remarkable progress in text, vision, and video
understanding, and are now poised to unlock similar breakthroughs in trajectory
modeling. We introduce the GPSMasked Trajectory Transformer (GPS-MTM), a
foundation model for large-scale mobility data that captures patterns of
normalcy in human movement. Unlike prior approaches that flatten trajectories
into coordinate streams, GPS-MTM decomposes mobility into two complementary
modalities: states (point-of-interest categories) and actions (agent
transitions). Leveraging a bi-directional Transformer with a self-supervised
masked modeling objective, the model reconstructs missing segments across
modalities, enabling it to learn rich semantic correlations without manual
labels. Across benchmark datasets, including Numosim-LA, Urban Anomalies, and
Geolife, GPS-MTM consistently outperforms on downstream tasks such as
trajectory infilling and next-stop prediction. Its advantages are most
pronounced in dynamic tasks (inverse and forward dynamics), where contextual
reasoning is critical. These results establish GPS-MTM as a robust foundation
model for trajectory analytics, positioning mobility data as a first-class
modality for large-scale representation learning. Code is released for further
reference.

Conclusion: 该框架统一了风险敏感学习和乐观主义，为多智能体强化学习中的合作问题提供了理论基础和实际有效的方法。

Abstract: Risk sensitivity has become a central theme in reinforcement learning (RL),
where convex risk measures and robust formulations provide principled ways to
model preferences beyond expected return. Recent extensions to multi-agent RL
(MARL) have largely emphasized the risk-averse setting, prioritizing robustness
to uncertainty. In cooperative MARL, however, such conservatism often leads to
suboptimal equilibria, and a parallel line of work has shown that optimism can
promote cooperation. Existing optimistic methods, though effective in practice,
are typically heuristic and lack theoretical grounding. Building on the dual
representation for convex risk measures, we propose a principled framework that
interprets risk-seeking objectives as optimism. We introduce optimistic value
functions, which formalize optimism as divergence-penalized risk-seeking
evaluations. Building on this foundation, we derive a policy-gradient theorem
for optimistic value functions, including explicit formulas for the entropic
risk/KL-penalty setting, and develop decentralized optimistic actor-critic
algorithms that implement these updates. Empirical results on cooperative
benchmarks demonstrate that risk-seeking optimism consistently improves
coordination over both risk-neutral baselines and heuristic optimistic methods.
Our framework thus unifies risk-sensitive learning and optimism, offering a
theoretically grounded and practically effective approach to cooperation in
MARL.

Conclusion: 提出的框架通过让设备端LLM自主决策路由，有效解决了设备-云协作中的路由问题，实现了更好的性能平衡。

Abstract: Device-cloud collaboration has emerged as a promising paradigm for deploying
large language models (LLMs), combining the efficiency of lightweight on-device
inference with the superior performance of powerful cloud LLMs. An essential
problem in this scenario lies in deciding whether a given query is best handled
locally or delegated to the cloud. Existing approaches typically rely on
external routers, implemented as binary classifiers, which often struggle to
determine task difficulty from the prompt's surface pattern. To address these
limitations, we propose a framework where the on-device LLM makes routing
decisions at the end of its solving process, with this capability instilled
through post-training. In particular, we formulate a reward maximization
problem with carefully designed rewards that encourage effective problem
solving and judicious offloading to the cloud. To solve this problem, we
develop a group-adaptive policy gradient algorithm, featuring a group-level
policy gradient, designed to yield an unbiased gradient estimator of the
reward, and adaptive prompt filtering, developed to enforce the constraint on
cloud LLM usage. Extensive experiments across models and benchmarks show that
the proposed methodology consistently outperforms existing baselines and
significantly narrows the gap to full cloud LLM performance.

Result: 发现了一个普遍规律：CAVs的方差随随机样本数量N的增加以1/N的速度减小。

Conclusion: 基于理论分析结果，提出了资源高效应用CAVs方法的实用建议，帮助用户在计算资源有限的情况下获得稳定的概念解释。

Abstract: One of the most pressing challenges in artificial intelligence is to make
models more transparent to their users. Recently, explainable artificial
intelligence has come up with numerous method to tackle this challenge. A
promising avenue is to use concept-based explanations, that is, high-level
concepts instead of plain feature importance score. Among this class of
methods, Concept Activation vectors (CAVs), Kim et al. (2018) stands out as one
of the main protagonists. One interesting aspect of CAVs is that their
computation requires sampling random examples in the train set. Therefore, the
actual vectors obtained may vary from user to user depending on the randomness
of this sampling. In this paper, we propose a fine-grained theoretical analysis
of CAVs construction in order to quantify their variability. Our results,
confirmed by experiments on several real-life datasets, point out towards an
universal result: the variance of CAVs decreases as $1/N$, where $N$ is the
number of random examples. Based on this we give practical recommendations for
a resource-efficient application of the method.

Result: 在厨房任务中性能提升高达16.4%，在Gym和Adroit任务中分别提升8.6%和6.3%。

Conclusion: ICQL展示了上下文学习在稳健和组合价值估计中的潜力，为离线RL提供了一个原则性且有效的框架。

Abstract: Accurately estimating the Q-function is a central challenge in offline
reinforcement learning. However, existing approaches often rely on a single
global Q-function, which struggles to capture the compositional nature of tasks
involving diverse subtasks. We propose In-context Compositional Q-Learning
(\texttt{ICQL}), the first offline RL framework that formulates Q-learning as a
contextual inference problem, using linear Transformers to adaptively infer
local Q-functions from retrieved transitions without explicit subtask labels.
Theoretically, we show that under two assumptions--linear approximability of
the local Q-function and accurate weight inference from retrieved
context--\texttt{ICQL} achieves bounded Q-function approximation error, and
supports near-optimal policy extraction. Empirically, \texttt{ICQL}
substantially improves performance in offline settings: improving performance
in kitchen tasks by up to 16.4\%, and in Gym and Adroit tasks by up to 8.6\%
and 6.3\%. These results highlight the underexplored potential of in-context
learning for robust and compositional value estimation, positioning
\texttt{ICQL} as a principled and effective framework for offline RL.

Motivation: 将传统的儿童算术学习理论（SCT）与现代神经网络架构相结合，为研究数学推理能力在基于LLM的智能体中的涌现提供统一平台。

Method: 采用类似LLM的神经网络架构，扩展SCT以包含计数练习、数字符号嵌入和门控注意力机制。

Conclusion: 计划将SMM扩展到SCT项目的后期方面，包括自适应策略选择和策略发现，为研究数学推理能力提供统一平台。

Abstract: Strategy Choice Theory (SCT)\footnote{``Strategy Choice Theory'',
``Distributions of Associations'', and ``Overlapping Wave Theory'' have been
used to refer to this line of work, emphasizing different
aspects.}\citep[e.g.,][]{siegler1984strategychoices, siegler2000rebirth}
explains important aspects of children's arithmetic learning based upon
principles including learning from developmentally naturalistic data,
probabilistic representation, confidence-based retrieval, and the phase-like
importance of scaffolding strategies, such as finger-counting. Here we recast
SCT as a ``Small Math Model'' (SMM), employing a neural-network-based
architecture analogous to LLMs. The SMM extends SCT to include counting
practice\footnote{The original SCT model was pre-biased in accordance with the
supposed experience of counting.}, symbol (number) embedding, and gated
attention. Similar to earlier work, the SMM demonstrates constructive and
destructive interference between counting and addition, and the ``wave-like''
use of finger-counting as sum recall improves. We plan to extend the SMM to
later aspects of the decades-long SCT program, including adaptive strategy
choice and eventually strategy discovery, providing a unified platform to
investigate the understanding of numerical characteristics and relationships
essential for mathematical reasoning -- as it can emerge in LLM-based agents.

TL;DR: AQUAIR是一个公开的室内水产养殖环境数据集，记录了6个室内环境质量变量，填补了智能水产养殖信息学的关键空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于描述室内养殖池周围空气环境的公共数据集稀缺，限制了结合空气条件与水质动态的预测和异常检测工具的开发。

Method: 使用Awair HOME监测器在摩洛哥水产养殖设施中每5分钟采样一次，收集超过23,000个时间戳观测数据，并进行质量控制和开源数据处理。

Result: 数据显示稳定条件（中位CO2=758 ppm；PM2.5=12微克/立方米）和明显的喂食时间峰值，为短期预测、事件检测和传感器漂移研究提供了丰富结构。

Conclusion: AQUAIR填补了智能水产养殖信息学的关键空白，为数据中心的机器学习课程和环境传感研究提供了可复现的基准。

Abstract: Smart aquaculture systems depend on rich environmental data streams to
protect fish welfare, optimize feeding, and reduce energy use. Yet public
datasets that describe the air surrounding indoor tanks remain scarce, limiting
the development of forecasting and anomaly-detection tools that couple
head-space conditions with water-quality dynamics. We therefore introduce
AQUAIR, an open-access public dataset that logs six Indoor Environmental
Quality (IEQ) variables--air temperature, relative humidity, carbon dioxide,
total volatile organic compounds, PM2.5 and PM10--inside a fish aquaculture
facility in Amghass, Azrou, Morocco. A single Awair HOME monitor sampled every
five minutes from 14 October 2024 to 9 January 2025, producing more than 23,000
time-stamped observations that are fully quality-controlled and publicly
archived on Figshare. We describe the sensor placement, ISO-compliant mounting
height, calibration checks against reference instruments, and an open-source
processing pipeline that normalizes timestamps, interpolates short gaps, and
exports analysis-ready tables. Exploratory statistics show stable conditions
(median CO2 = 758 ppm; PM2.5 = 12 micrograms/m3) with pronounced feeding-time
peaks, offering rich structure for short-horizon forecasting, event detection,
and sensor drift studies. AQUAIR thus fills a critical gap in smart aquaculture
informatics and provides a reproducible benchmark for data-centric machine
learning curricula and environmental sensing research focused on head-space
dynamics in recirculating aquaculture systems.

TL;DR: 结合混合密度网络与对比学习成本，提出四种核化矩阵成本用于数据密度逼近，包括标量成本、向量-矩阵成本、矩阵-矩阵成本（Schur补迹）和SVD成本（核范数）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于成对距离的成本在自监督和对比特征学习中至关重要，混合密度网络是生成模型和密度逼近的常用方法，通过结合两者来改进密度逼近效果。

Method: 将混合密度网络与对比成本结合，使用四种核化矩阵成本（标量成本、向量-矩阵成本、矩阵-矩阵成本、SVD成本）来学习定义混合密度所需的多个中心。

Result: 提出了一个结合MDN和对比学习的框架，能够通过不同的矩阵成本函数来逼近数据密度。

Conclusion: 该方法为自监督学习和密度逼近提供了一种新的结合方式，通过多种矩阵成本函数增强了混合密度网络的学习能力。

Abstract: Pairwise distance-based costs are crucial for self-supervised and contrastive
feature learning. Mixture Density Networks (MDNs) are a widely used approach
for generative models and density approximation, using neural networks to
produce multiple centers that define a Gaussian mixture. By combining MDNs with
contrastive costs, this paper proposes data density approximation using four
types of kernelized matrix costs: the scalar cost, the vector-matrix cost, the
matrix-matrix cost (the trace of Schur complement), and the SVD cost (the
nuclear norm), for learning multiple centers required to define a mixture
density.

Conclusion: DAFH方法能够在无需人口统计信息的情况下实现公平性，同时保持高准确率，为高风险领域提供了可行的公平机器学习解决方案。

Abstract: As machine learning (ML) algorithms are increasingly used in social domains
to make predictions about humans, there is a growing concern that these
algorithms may exhibit biases against certain social groups. Numerous notions
of fairness have been proposed in the literature to measure the unfairness of
ML. Among them, one class that receives the most attention is
\textit{parity-based}, i.e., achieving fairness by equalizing treatment or
outcomes for different social groups. However, achieving parity-based fairness
often comes at the cost of lowering model accuracy and is undesirable for many
high-stakes domains like healthcare. To avoid inferior accuracy, a line of
research focuses on \textit{preference-based} fairness, under which any group
of individuals would experience the highest accuracy and collectively prefer
the ML outcomes assigned to them if they were given the choice between various
sets of outcomes. However, these works assume individual demographic
information is known and fully accessible during training. In this paper, we
relax this requirement and propose a novel \textit{demographic-agnostic
fairness without harm (DAFH)} optimization algorithm, which jointly learns a
group classifier that partitions the population into multiple groups and a set
of decoupled classifiers associated with these groups. Theoretically, we
conduct sample complexity analysis and show that our method can outperform the
baselines when demographic information is known and used to train decoupled
classifiers. Experiments on both synthetic and real data validate the proposed
method.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PEARL是一个基于设备端LLM的D2D通信协作跨层优化框架，通过利用发布者和订阅者状态来指导Wi-Fi Aware参数选择，在保持高性能的同时实现低延迟推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展单设备设备端LLM范式，利用对等设备状态信息来优化D2D通信性能，特别是在低电量等资源受限场景下。

Method: 使用上下文感知奖励（根据应用容忍度归一化延迟、根据设备电量状态调整能耗）进行KL微调，提出两种轻量变体：PEARL（Head+LoRA）和PEARL-Lite（仅Head）。

Result: PEARL在基于真实测量的合成场景中优于启发式和紧凑模型基线，在协作低电量情况下能耗降低达16%，PEARL-Lite实现亚20ms推理且目标分数接近。

Conclusion: 对等感知上下文、奖励对齐训练和基于头部的效率使LLM适用于持续运行的设备端跨层控制。

Abstract: We present PEARL (Peer-Enhanced Adaptive Radio via On-Device LLM), a
framework for cooperative cross-layer optimization in device-to-device (D2D)
communication. Building on our previous work on single-device on-device LLMs,
PEARL extends the paradigm by leveraging both publisher and subscriber states
to guide Wi-Fi Aware (WA) parameter selection. A context-aware reward, which
normalizes latency by application tolerances and modulates energy by device
battery states, provides richer supervision for KL-based finetuning. We study
two lightweight variants: PEARL (Head + Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)) achieves
the best overall performance, while PEARL-Lite (Head-only) delivers sub-20 ms
inference at near-identical objective scores. Across synthetic scenarios
grounded in real measurements, PEARL improves objective scores over heuristic
and compact model baselines and reduces energy by up to 16% in cooperative
low-battery cases. These results demonstrate that peer-aware context,
reward-aligned training, and head-based efficiency make LLMs practical for
always-on, on-device cross-layer control.

TL;DR: 提出ADAPT模型，用基于坐标的Transformer架构替代图神经网络，在硅点缺陷数据集上相比SOTA GNN模型减少约33%的力和能量预测误差，且计算成本显著降低


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 第一性原理方法计算缺陷能学和结构成本高昂，机器学习力场是加速结构松弛的有吸引力的替代方案。现有基于GNN的MLFF存在过平滑和长程相互作用表示不佳的问题，这些问题在点缺陷建模中尤为突出

Method: 引入ADAPT模型，用直接坐标空间表示替代图表示，显式考虑所有原子对相互作用。将原子视为token，使用Transformer编码器建模其相互作用

Result: 在硅点缺陷数据集上，ADAPT相比最先进的GNN模型在力和能量预测误差上减少约33%，同时仅需一小部分计算成本

Conclusion: ADAPT通过坐标空间表示和Transformer架构有效解决了GNN在点缺陷建模中的局限性，为加速缺陷计算提供了高效解决方案

Abstract: Point defects play a central role in driving the properties of materials.
First-principles methods are widely used to compute defect energetics and
structures, including at scale for high-throughput defect databases. However,
these methods are computationally expensive, making machine-learning force
fields (MLFFs) an attractive alternative for accelerating structural
relaxations. Most existing MLFFs are based on graph neural networks (GNNs),
which can suffer from oversmoothing and poor representation of long-range
interactions. Both of these issues are especially of concern when modeling
point defects. To address these challenges, we introduce the Accelerated Deep
Atomic Potential Transformer (ADAPT), an MLFF that replaces graph
representations with a direct coordinates-in-space formulation and explicitly
considers all pairwise atomic interactions. Atoms are treated as tokens, with a
Transformer encoder modeling their interactions. Applied to a dataset of
silicon point defects, ADAPT achieves a roughly 33 percent reduction in both
force and energy prediction errors relative to a state-of-the-art GNN-based
model, while requiring only a fraction of the computational cost.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 偏微分方程控制的逆问题在科学和工程中很重要，但由于不适定性、数据稀疏性和不规则几何的复杂性而具有挑战性。传统方法计算成本高，而现有学习方法大多针对规则域或前向建模。

Method: 提出GeoFunFlow框架，包含几何函数自动编码器(GeoFAE)和基于整流流的潜在扩散模型。GeoFAE使用Perceiver模块处理不同大小的非结构化网格，生成物理场的连续重建。

Result: 在五个基准测试中，GeoFunFlow在复杂几何上实现了最先进的重建精度，提供了校准的不确定性量化，相比算子学习和扩散模型基线具有更高效的推理。

Conclusion: GeoFunFlow为复杂几何上的逆问题提供了一个有效的解决方案，结合了几何感知编码和扩散建模的优势，实现了准确重建和可靠的不确定性量化。

Abstract: Inverse problems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs) are
crucial in science and engineering. They are particularly challenging due to
ill-posedness, data sparsity, and the added complexity of irregular geometries.
Classical PDE-constrained optimization methods are computationally expensive,
especially when repeated posterior sampling is required. Learning-based
approaches improve efficiency and scalability, yet most are designed for
regular domains or focus on forward modeling. Here, we introduce {\em
GeoFunFlow}, a geometric diffusion model framework for inverse problems on
complex geometries. GeoFunFlow combines a novel geometric function autoencoder
(GeoFAE) and a latent diffusion model trained via rectified flow. GeoFAE
employs a Perceiver module to process unstructured meshes of varying sizes and
produces continuous reconstructions of physical fields, while the diffusion
model enables posterior sampling from sparse and noisy data. Across five
benchmarks, GeoFunFlow achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction accuracy over
complex geometries, provides calibrated uncertainty quantification, and
delivers efficient inference compared to operator-learning and diffusion model
baselines.

TL;DR: 提出HyMaTE混合模型，结合状态空间模型和Transformer注意力机制，用于电子健康记录表示学习，在多个临床数据集上验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子健康记录数据具有长序列、多变量、稀疏和缺失值等复杂特性，传统Transformer模型存在二次计算复杂度和上下文长度限制的问题，而状态空间模型主要关注序列级信息混合而非通道级数据。

Method: 提出HyMaTE混合模型，将状态空间模型（如Mamba）的线性时间序列建模能力与注意力机制相结合，专门为纵向数据表示学习设计。

Result: 在多个临床数据集的预测任务上测试表明，HyMaTE能够捕获更有效、更丰富和更细致的统一EHR数据表示，自注意力的可解释性证明了模型的有效性。

Conclusion: HyMaTE作为可扩展和泛化的解决方案，适用于现实世界的医疗应用，代码已开源。

Abstract: Electronic health Records (EHRs) have become a cornerstone in modern-day
healthcare. They are a crucial part for analyzing the progression of patient
health; however, their complexity, characterized by long, multivariate
sequences, sparsity, and missing values poses significant challenges in
traditional deep learning modeling. While Transformer-based models have
demonstrated success in modeling EHR data and predicting clinical outcomes,
their quadratic computational complexity and limited context length hinder
their efficiency and practical applications. On the other hand, State Space
Models (SSMs) like Mamba present a promising alternative offering linear-time
sequence modeling and improved efficiency for handling long sequences, but
focus mostly on mixing sequence-level information rather than channel-level
data. To overcome these challenges, we propose HyMaTE (A Hybrid Mamba and
Transformer Model for EHR Representation Learning), a novel hybrid model
tailored for representing longitudinal data, combining the strengths of SSMs
with advanced attention mechanisms. By testing the model on predictive tasks on
multiple clinical datasets, we demonstrate HyMaTE's ability to capture an
effective, richer, and more nuanced unified representation of EHR data.
Additionally, the interpretability of the outcomes achieved by self-attention
illustrates the effectiveness of our model as a scalable and generalizable
solution for real-world healthcare applications. Codes are available at:

*Hongbo Liu,Jia Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Echo Flow Networks (EFNs)框架，通过扩展的Echo State Networks和创新的MCRA激活函数，在保持计算效率的同时显著提升了时间序列预测的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决时间序列预测中长程依赖关系建模的挑战，传统方法在计算复杂度和信息保留能力之间存在权衡，而Echo State Networks虽然效率高但表达能力有限。

Method: 使用扩展的Echo State Networks (X-ESNs)和MLP读出层，引入Matrix-Gated Composite Random Activation (MCRA)实现复杂的神经元特定时间动态，采用双流架构动态选择特征。

Result: 在五个基准数据集上，EFNs实现了比PatchTST快4倍的训练速度和3倍小的模型尺寸，预测误差从43%降至35%，相对改进20%。EchoFormer在所有数据集上达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: EFNs框架在保持Echo State Networks计算效率优势的同时，显著提升了时间序列预测的性能，为长序列建模提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: At the heart of time-series forecasting (TSF) lies a fundamental challenge:
how can models efficiently and effectively capture long-range temporal
dependencies across ever-growing sequences? While deep learning has brought
notable progress, conventional architectures often face a trade-off between
computational complexity and their ability to retain accumulative information
over extended horizons.
  Echo State Networks (ESNs), a class of reservoir computing models, have
recently regained attention for their exceptional efficiency, offering constant
memory usage and per-step training complexity regardless of input length. This
makes them particularly attractive for modeling extremely long-term event
history in TSF. However, traditional ESNs fall short of state-of-the-art
performance due to their limited nonlinear capacity, which constrains both
their expressiveness and stability.
  We introduce Echo Flow Networks (EFNs), a framework composed of a group of
extended Echo State Networks (X-ESNs) with MLP readouts, enhanced by our novel
Matrix-Gated Composite Random Activation (MCRA), which enables complex,
neuron-specific temporal dynamics, significantly expanding the network's
representational capacity without compromising computational efficiency. In
addition, we propose a dual-stream architecture in which recent input history
dynamically selects signature reservoir features from an infinite-horizon
memory, leading to improved prediction accuracy and long-term stability.
  Extensive evaluations on five benchmarks demonstrate that EFNs achieve up to
4x faster training and 3x smaller model size compared to leading methods like
PatchTST, reducing forecasting error from 43% to 35%, a 20% relative
improvement. One instantiation of our framework, EchoFormer, consistently
achieves new state-of-the-art performance across five benchmark datasets: ETTh,
ETTm, DMV, Weather, and Air Quality.

### [647] [The Impossibility of Inverse Permutation Learning in Transformer Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24125)

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In this technical note, we study the problem of inverse permutation learning
in decoder-only transformers. Given a permutation and a string to which that
permutation has been applied, the model is tasked with producing the original
(``canonical'') string. We argue that this task models a natural robustness
property across a variety of reasoning tasks, including long-context retrieval,
multiple choice QA and in-context learning. Our primary contribution is an
impossibility result: we show that an arbitrary depth, decoder-only transformer
cannot learn this task. This result concerns the expressive capacity of
decoder-only transformer models and is agnostic to training dynamics or sample
complexity. We give a pair of alternative constructions under which inverse
permutation learning is feasible. The first of these highlights the fundamental
role of the causal attention mask, and reveals a gap between the expressivity
of encoder-decoder transformers and the more popular decoder-only architecture.
The latter result is more surprising: we show that simply padding the input
with ``scratch tokens" yields a construction under which inverse permutation
learning is possible. We conjecture that this may suggest an alternative
mechanism by which chain-of-thought prompting or, more generally, intermediate
``thinking'' tokens can enable reasoning in large language models, even when
these tokens encode no meaningful semantic information (e.g., the results of
intermediate computations).

Method: 使用信号处理中为点源信号分离问题开发的局部三角多项式核，将不同类别视为来自不同概率分布，通过分层MASC算法处理重叠类别边界

Result: 在多个模拟和真实数据集上验证了理论，包括Salinas和Indian Pines高光谱数据集以及文档数据集

Conclusion: 局部核技术能够分离不同分布的支持集，分层方法可处理重叠类别边界，为分类问题提供了新视角

Abstract: The problem of classification in machine learning has often been approached
in terms of function approximation. In this paper, we propose an alternative
approach for classification in arbitrary compact metric spaces which, in
theory, yields both the number of classes, and a perfect classification using a
minimal number of queried labels. Our approach uses localized trigonometric
polynomial kernels initially developed for the point source signal separation
problem in signal processing. Rather than point sources, we argue that the
various classes come from different probability distributions. The localized
kernel technique developed for separating point sources is then shown to
separate the supports of these distributions. This is done in a hierarchical
manner in our MASC algorithm to accommodate touching/overlapping class
boundaries. We illustrate our theory on several simulated and real life
datasets, including the Salinas and Indian Pines hyperspectral datasets and a
document dataset.

Conclusion: 机器学习模型，特别是基于集成的分类器，为传统预测方法提供了有效、可扩展的替代方案，具有实时台风预测和集成到决策支持系统的潜力。

Abstract: Accurate cyclone forecasting is essential for minimizing loss of life,
infrastructure damage, and economic disruption. Traditional numerical weather
prediction models, though effective, are computationally intensive and prone to
error due to the chaotic nature of atmospheric systems. This study proposes a
machine learning (ML) approach to forecasting tropical cyclone trajectory and
status using time series data from the National Hurricane Center, including
recently added best track wind radii. A two-stage ML pipeline is developed: a
regression model first predicts cyclone features maximum wind speed, minimum
pressure, trajectory length, and directional change using a sliding window of
historical data. These outputs are then input into classification models to
predict the cyclone's categorical status. Gradient boosting regression and
three classifiers random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and
multilayer perceptron (MLP) are evaluated. After hyperparameter tuning and
synthetic minority oversampling (SMOTE), the RF classifier achieves the highest
performance with 93% accuracy, outperforming SVM and MLP across precision,
recall, and F1 score. The RF model is particularly robust in identifying
minority cyclone statuses and minimizing false negatives. Regression results
yield low mean absolute errors, with pressure and wind predictions within about
2.2 mb and 2.4 kt, respectively. These findings demonstrate that ML models,
especially ensemble-based classifiers, offer an effective, scalable alternative
to traditional forecasting methods, with potential for real-time cyclone
prediction and integration into decision support systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型遗忘方法不稳定不可靠，特别是梯度差异方法在交叉熵损失下会导致权重和梯度无界增长，造成训练不稳定并影响遗忘和保留效果。

Method: 提出有界参数高效遗忘方法，在LoRA微调基础上对有界函数应用梯度差异方法，通过控制MLP适配器的权重动态来稳定优化过程。

Result: 在TOFU、TDEC和MUSE基准测试中，从125M到8B参数的各种架构和规模上都实现了显著的遗忘改进，同时保持了保留效果。

Conclusion: 建立了一个理论上有基础、实践上可扩展的LLM遗忘框架，通过有界参数高效方法解决了梯度差异方法的不稳定性问题。

Abstract: Machine unlearning in large language models (LLMs) is essential for privacy
and safety; however, existing approaches remain unstable and unreliable. A
widely used strategy, the gradient difference method, applies gradient descent
on retained data while performing gradient ascent on forget data, the data
whose influence should be removed. However, when combined with cross-entropy
loss, this procedure causes unbounded growth of weights and gradients, leading
to training instability and degrading both forgetting and retention. We provide
a theoretical framework that explains this failure, explicitly showing how
ascent on the forget set destabilizes optimization in the feedforward MLP
layers of LLMs. Guided by this insight, we propose Bounded Parameter-Efficient
Unlearning, a parameter-efficient approach that stabilizes LoRA-based
fine-tuning by applying bounded functions to MLP adapters. This simple
modification controls the weight dynamics during ascent, enabling the gradient
difference method to converge reliably. Across the TOFU, TDEC, and MUSE
benchmarks, and across architectures and scales from 125M to 8B parameters, our
method achieves substantial improvements in forgetting while preserving
retention, establishing a novel theoretically grounded and practically scalable
framework for unlearning in LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自编码器方法通常分别关注全局或局部几何特性，全局方法存在距离近似误差累积问题，局部方法容易收敛到扭曲大尺度关系的次优解。

Method: 采用非对称架构设计，编码器负责全局距离保持，解码器负责局部几何结构重建，通过理论分析证明这种设计与编码器-解码器不同角色的自然契合。

Result: 在合成流形和真实数据集上的综合实验表明，MAE在各种评估指标上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 多尺度几何自编码器通过非对称设计有效解决了自编码器中几何结构保持的挑战，实现了全局和局部几何特性的同时优化。

Abstract: Autoencoders have emerged as powerful models for visualization and
dimensionality reduction based on the fundamental assumption that
high-dimensional data is generated from a low-dimensional manifold. A critical
challenge in autoencoder design is to preserve the geometric structure of data
in the latent space, with existing approaches typically focusing on either
global or local geometric properties separately. Global approaches often
encounter errors in distance approximation that accumulate, while local methods
frequently converge to suboptimal solutions that distort large-scale
relationships. We propose Multi-Scale Geometric Autoencoder (MAE), which
introduces an asymmetric architecture that simultaneously preserves both scales
of the geometric structure by applying global distance constraints to the
encoder and local geometric constraints to the decoder. Through theoretical
analysis, we establish that this asymmetric design aligns naturally with the
distinct roles of the encoder and decoder components. Our comprehensive
experiments on both synthetic manifolds and real-world datasets demonstrate
that MAE consistently outperforms existing methods across various evaluation
metrics.

TL;DR: 提出了Random Selection Probing (RSP)框架，用于检测语言模型和视觉语言模型之间的相关性，通过统计假设检验产生严格的p值来判断模型是否相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型和视觉语言模型的普及，需要可靠的方法来判断模型是否经过微调或完全相同。现有方法通常需要访问模型参数或产生没有原则性阈值的启发式分数，限制了其适用性。

Method: RSP框架将模型相关性检测制定为统计检验，在参考模型上优化文本或视觉前缀用于随机选择任务，并评估它们到目标模型的可迁移性，产生严格的p值来量化相关性证据。

Result: 在LLM和VLM上的实验表明，RSP对相关模型产生小p值，对不相关模型保持高p值，广泛的消融研究进一步证明了RSP的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: RSP是第一个用于模型相关性检测的原则性和通用统计框架，能够在现代机器学习生态系统中实现透明和可解释的决策。

Abstract: The growing prevalence of large language models (LLMs) and vision-language
models (VLMs) has heightened the need for reliable techniques to determine
whether a model has been fine-tuned from or is even identical to another.
Existing similarity-based methods often require access to model parameters or
produce heuristic scores without principled thresholds, limiting their
applicability. We introduce Random Selection Probing (RSP), a
hypothesis-testing framework that formulates model correlation detection as a
statistical test. RSP optimizes textual or visual prefixes on a reference model
for a random selection task and evaluates their transferability to a target
model, producing rigorous p-values that quantify evidence of correlation. To
mitigate false positives, RSP incorporates an unrelated baseline model to
filter out generic, transferable features. We evaluate RSP across both LLMs and
VLMs under diverse access conditions for reference models and test models.
Experiments on fine-tuned and open-source models show that RSP consistently
yields small p-values for related models while maintaining high p-values for
unrelated ones. Extensive ablation studies further demonstrate the robustness
of RSP. These results establish RSP as the first principled and general
statistical framework for model correlation detection, enabling transparent and
interpretable decisions in modern machine learning ecosystems.

TL;DR: FM-FoG是一个基于基础模型的实时可穿戴系统，无需患者特定训练即可在未见过的帕金森患者中检测冻结步态，通过自监督预训练和传感器上下文集成实现高精度检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 冻结步态影响超过50%的中晚期帕金森患者，显著损害患者行动独立性并降低生活质量。现有检测系统需要大量患者特定训练数据且缺乏泛化能力，限制了临床部署。

Method: 结合自监督预训练和传感器上下文集成，使用轻量级CNN-LSTM活动分类器仅在行走或站立时激活基础模型，避免不必要计算。

Result: 在23名PD患者的VCU FoG-IMU数据集上，FM-FoG在未见患者测试中达到98.5% F1分数，显著优于基线方法。部署在Google Pixel 8a手机上可延长电池寿命达72%，同时保持低于20ms的干预延迟。

Conclusion: FM-FoG能够实现实用、节能的医疗应用，无需个体训练要求即可跨患者泛化。

Abstract: Freezing-of-Gait (FoG) affects over 50% of mid-to-late stage Parkinson's
disease (PD) patients, significantly impairing patients' mobility independence
and reducing quality of life. FoG is characterized by sudden episodes where
walking cannot start or is interrupted, occurring exclusively during standing
or walking, and never while sitting or lying down. Current FoG detection
systems require extensive patient-specific training data and lack
generalization, limiting clinical deployment. To address these issues, we
introduce FM-FoG, a real-time foundation model-based wearable system achieving
FoG detection in unseen patients without patient-specific training. Our
approach combines self-supervised pretraining on diverse Inertial Measurement
Unit (IMU) datasets with sensor context integration. Since FoG occurs only
during ambulatory activities, a lightweight CNN-LSTM activity classifier
selectively activates the foundation model only during walking or standing,
avoiding unnecessary computation. Evaluated on the VCU FoG-IMU dataset with 23
PD patients, FM-FoG achieves a 98.5% F1-score when tested on previously unseen
patients, substantially outperforming competitive baseline methods. Deployed on
a Google Pixel 8a smartphone, the system extends battery life by up to 72%
while maintaining sub-20ms intervention latency. The results indicate that our
FM-FoG can enable practical, energy-efficient healthcare applications that
generalize across patients without individual training requirements.

### [654] [Negative Pre-activations Differentiate Syntax](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24198)
*Linghao Kong,Angelina Ning,Micah Adler,Nir Shavit*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文发现语言模型中存在一类特殊的Wasserstein神经元，它们在负激活区域对相似输入进行区分，这种负向分化机制对语法处理至关重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型中特定类型神经元的功能，特别是那些在相似输入区分中起关键作用的Wasserstein神经元，探索它们在语法处理中的独特作用。

Method: 通过靶向移除Wasserstein神经元、零化负预激活值等干预实验，结合词性分析和分层干预，研究这些神经元在语法处理中的功能。

Result: 靶向干预Wasserstein神经元的负预激活会显著削弱模型功能并破坏语法行为，而随机控制干预影响较小；语法支架标记的意外性增加，局部退化在深度上累积。

Conclusion: 稀疏的纠缠神经元中的负向分化是语言模型依赖的关键语法机制，这些神经元在训练过程中出现并稳定，对语法处理至关重要。

Abstract: A recently discovered class of entangled neurons, known as Wasserstein
neurons, is disproportionately critical in large language models despite
constituting only a very small fraction of the network: their targeted removal
collapses the model, consistent with their unique role in differentiating
similar inputs. Interestingly, in Wasserstein neurons immediately preceding
smooth activation functions, such differentiation manifests in the negative
pre-activation space, especially in early layers. Pairs of similar inputs are
driven to highly distinct negative values, and these pairs involve syntactic
tokens such as determiners and prepositions. We show that this negative region
is functional rather than simply favorable for optimization. A minimal,
sign-specific intervention that zeroes only the negative pre-activations of a
small subset of entangled neurons significantly weakens overall model function
and disrupts grammatical behavior, while both random and perplexity-matched
controls leave grammatical performance largely unchanged. Part of speech
analysis localizes the excess surprisal to syntactic scaffolding tokens, and
layer-specific interventions reveal that small local degradations accumulate
across depth. Over training checkpoints, the same ablation impairs grammatical
behavior as Wasserstein neurons emerge and stabilize. Together, these results
identify negative differentiation in a sparse subset of entangled neurons as a
crucial mechanism that language models rely on for syntax.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文重新解读了REINFORCE算法，揭示了其在离策略强化学习中的适用性，并提出了两个通用原则：正则化策略更新和主动塑造数据分布，为LLM的离策略RL提供了新的算法设计思路。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实际应用中的约束、LLM-RL基础设施的复杂性以及RL方法创新的需求，推动了对大型语言模型离策略强化学习的兴趣增长。传统上REINFORCE及其变体被视为在策略算法，但本文旨在探索其在离策略设置中的潜力。

Method: 从第一性原理推导了组相对REINFORCE算法，不假设特定的训练数据分布，展示了其天然的离策略解释。提出了两个适应离策略设置的原则：正则化策略更新和主动塑造数据分布。

Result: 分析澄清了GRPO中重要性采样和裁剪的作用，统一并重新解释了OPMD和AsymRE算法作为REINFORCE损失的正则化形式，为启发式数据加权策略提供了理论依据。

Conclusion: 研究结果为LLM的离策略RL提供了可操作的见解，并通过实证研究验证，为原则性算法设计开辟了新机会。

Abstract: Off-policy reinforcement learning (RL) for large language models (LLMs) is
attracting growing interest, driven by practical constraints in real-world
applications, the complexity of LLM-RL infrastructure, and the need for further
innovations of RL methodologies. While classic REINFORCE and its modern
variants like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) are typically regarded
as on-policy algorithms with limited tolerance of off-policyness, we present in
this work a first-principles derivation for group-relative REINFORCE without
assuming a specific training data distribution, showing that it admits a native
off-policy interpretation. This perspective yields two general principles for
adapting REINFORCE to off-policy settings: regularizing policy updates, and
actively shaping the data distribution. Our analysis demystifies some myths
about the roles of importance sampling and clipping in GRPO, unifies and
reinterprets two recent algorithms -- Online Policy Mirror Descent (OPMD) and
Asymmetric REINFORCE (AsymRE) -- as regularized forms of the REINFORCE loss,
and offers theoretical justification for seemingly heuristic data-weighting
strategies. Our findings lead to actionable insights that are validated with
extensive empirical studies, and open up new opportunities for principled
algorithm design in off-policy RL for LLMs. Source code for this work is

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MDD-Thinker是一个基于大语言模型的抑郁症诊断框架，通过监督微调和强化学习增强推理能力，在UK Biobank数据集上训练，显著优于传统方法和通用LLM。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前抑郁症诊断主要依赖主观评估，缺乏多模态临床信息整合能力，而大语言模型在诊断准确性方面有潜力但存在可解释性差、幻觉问题和依赖合成数据等挑战。

Method: 开发MDD-Thinker框架，结合监督微调和强化学习增强推理能力和可解释性。使用UK Biobank数据集生成40,000个推理样本，并补充10,000个公开心理健康数据集样本进行微调。

Result: MDD-Thinker达到0.8268准确率和0.8081 F1分数，显著优于SVM、MLP等传统方法和通用LLM。结合SFT和RL带来29.0%准确率、38.1% F1分数和34.8% AUC的相对提升，同时保持计算效率。

Conclusion: 这是首个基于大规模真实世界临床数据的推理增强LLM抑郁症诊断框架，通过整合SFT和RL在准确性、可解释性和效率之间取得平衡，为智能精神科诊断提供了可扩展方法。

Abstract: Background Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a leading cause of global
disability, yet current diagnostic approaches often rely on subjective
assessments and lack the ability to integrate multimodal clinical information.
Large language models (LLMs) hold promise for enhancing diagnostic accuracy
through advanced reasoning but face challenges in interpretability,
hallucination, and reliance on synthetic data.
  Methods We developed MDD-Thinker, an LLM-based diagnostic framework that
integrates supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with reinforcement learning (RL) to
strengthen reasoning ability and interpretability. Using the UK Biobank
dataset, we generated 40,000 reasoning samples, supplemented with 10,000
samples from publicly available mental health datasets. The model was
fine-tuned on these reasoning corpora, and its diagnostic and reasoning
performance was evaluated against machine learning, deep learning, and
state-of-the-art LLM baselines.
  Findings MDD-Thinker achieved an accuracy of 0.8268 and F1-score of 0.8081,
significantly outperforming traditional baselines such as SVM and MLP, as well
as general-purpose LLMs. Incorporating both SFT and RL yielded the greatest
improvements, with relative gains of 29.0% in accuracy, 38.1% in F1-score, and
34.8% in AUC. Moreover, the model demonstrated comparable reasoning performance
compared to much larger LLMs, while maintaining computational efficiency.
  Interpretation This study presents the first reasoning-enhanced LLM framework
for MDD diagnosis trained on large-scale real-world clinical data. By
integrating SFT and RL, MDD-Thinker balances accuracy, interpretability, and
efficiency, offering a scalable approach for intelligent psychiatric
diagnostics. These findings suggest that reasoning-oriented LLMs can provide
clinically reliable support for MDD detection and may inform broader
applications in mental health care.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Adam优化器在LLM预训练中存在的谱条件差和低秩结构问题，同时保持坐标自适应能力

Method: 通过将更新投影到正交子空间并基于投影梯度应用列级二阶矩归一化，改善谱条件同时保持坐标自适应

Result: 在LLaMA系列上达到AdamW 2-2.5倍的收敛速度，在训练步骤和训练时间上均有显著提升

Conclusion: Conda是适用于大规模LLM训练的有效且广泛适用的优化器

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive generalization and
emergent capabilities, yet their pre-training remains computationally expensive
and sensitive to optimization dynamics. While Adam-based optimizers offer fast
convergence by adapting learning rates coordinate-wise, recent studies reveal
that their updates often suffer from poor spectral conditioning and low-rank
structures, hindering efficiency. Muon addresses this issue via global spectral
normalization but lacks the per-coordinate adaptivity of Adam. In this work, we
propose \textbf{Column-Normalized Adam (Conda)}, a novel optimizer that bridges
the strengths of both approaches. Conda projects updates into an orthogonal
subspace and applies column-wise second moment normalization based on the
projected gradients, thereby achieving both improved spectral conditioning and
maintaining coordinate-wise adaptivity. This design alleviates the spectral
pathologies of Adam while preserving its fast convergence behavior. Extensive
experiments on the LLaMA and GPT-2 series show that Conda consistently
outperforms AdamW, Muon, and other baselines in pre-training. Remarkably, on
the LLaMA series, \textbf{Conda achieves $2{\sim}2.5\times$ the convergence
speed of AdamW, measured in both training steps and training time.} Further
ablations demonstrate its robustness under diverse training setups. These
results collectively highlight Conda as an effective and broadly applicable
optimizer for large-scale LLM training. The code is released on

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像编辑方法往往会扭曲细节或引入伪影，需要一种能保持视觉相似性同时实现语义编辑的解决方案。

Method: 通过使用相同相关噪声驱动源图像和编辑图像，利用耦合SDEs引导采样过程，适用于扩散模型和整流流模型等SDE采样模型。

Result: 方法实现了高提示保真度和接近像素级别的视觉一致性，无需重新训练即可直接使用。

Conclusion: 耦合SDEs是控制生成AI的简单而强大的工具，在保持源图像视觉特征的同时实现语义编辑。

Abstract: Editing the content of an image with a pretrained text-to-image model remains
challenging. Existing methods often distort fine details or introduce
unintended artifacts. We propose using coupled stochastic differential
equations (coupled SDEs) to guide the sampling process of any pre-trained
generative model that can be sampled by solving an SDE, including diffusion and
rectified flow models. By driving both the source image and the edited image
with the same correlated noise, our approach steers new samples toward the
desired semantics while preserving visual similarity to the source. The method
works out-of-the-box-without retraining or auxiliary networks-and achieves high
prompt fidelity along with near-pixel-level consistency. These results position
coupled SDEs as a simple yet powerful tool for controlled generative AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决ML在工业应用中因高昂成本和运营中断而难以落地的问题，特别是中小企业面临的全ML生命周期支持障碍。

Method: 采用人机协同方法，通过API框架将ML模型与生产环境分离，提供浏览器界面让专家交互控制模型参数。

Conclusion: 该框架通过减轻主要障碍，增强了制造业的竞争优势，提升了生产质量和安全性。

Abstract: The integration of machine learning (ML) is critical for industrial
competitiveness, yet its adoption is frequently stalled by the prohibitive
costs and operational disruptions of upgrading legacy systems. The financial
and logistical overhead required to support the full ML lifecycle presents a
formidable barrier to widespread implementation, particularly for small and
medium-sized enterprises. This paper introduces a pragmatic, API-based
framework designed to overcome these challenges by strategically decoupling the
ML model lifecycle from the production environment. Our solution delivers the
analytical power of ML to domain experts through a lightweight, browser-based
interface, eliminating the need for local hardware upgrades and ensuring model
maintenance can occur with zero production downtime. This human-in-the-loop
approach empowers experts with interactive control over model parameters,
fostering trust and facilitating seamless integration into existing workflows.
By mitigating the primary financial and operational risks, this framework
offers a scalable and accessible pathway to enhance production quality and
safety, thereby strengthening the competitive advantage of the manufacturing
sector.

TL;DR: 提出了首个PU学习基准，系统比较PU学习算法，解决了实验设置不一致、模型选择不现实、以及一样本与二样本设置间不公平比较等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PU学习算法的实验设置高度不一致，难以确定哪种算法性能更好，且许多算法依赖包含负样本的验证集进行模型选择，这在传统PU学习设置中不现实。

Method: 提出PU学习基准框架，系统研究PU学习的模型选择标准，识别一样本设置中未标记训练数据的内部标签偏移问题，并提出简单有效的校准方法。

Result: 建立了可访问、现实且公平的PU学习算法评估环境，解决了模型选择不现实和不同设置间比较偏差的问题。

Conclusion: 该基准框架为未来PU学习算法的评估提供了系统、公平的比较标准，有助于推动PU学习领域的发展。

Abstract: Positive-unlabeled (PU) learning is a weakly supervised binary classification
problem, in which the goal is to learn a binary classifier from only positive
and unlabeled data, without access to negative data. In recent years, many PU
learning algorithms have been developed to improve model performance. However,
experimental settings are highly inconsistent, making it difficult to identify
which algorithm performs better. In this paper, we propose the first PU
learning benchmark to systematically compare PU learning algorithms. During our
implementation, we identify subtle yet critical factors that affect the
realistic and fair evaluation of PU learning algorithms. On the one hand, many
PU learning algorithms rely on a validation set that includes negative data for
model selection. This is unrealistic in traditional PU learning settings, where
no negative data are available. To handle this problem, we systematically
investigate model selection criteria for PU learning. On the other hand, the
problem settings and solutions of PU learning have different families, i.e.,
the one-sample and two-sample settings. However, existing evaluation protocols
are heavily biased towards the one-sample setting and neglect the significant
difference between them. We identify the internal label shift problem of
unlabeled training data for the one-sample setting and propose a simple yet
effective calibration approach to ensure fair comparisons within and across
families. We hope our framework will provide an accessible, realistic, and fair
environment for evaluating PU learning algorithms in the future.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究大型语言模型是否真正具备复杂战略推理能力，还是仅仅擅长训练数据中的模式识别。

Method: 开发ChessArena象棋测试平台，包含四种游戏模式，让LLMs相互对战，并配备排名算法和排行榜系统。

Result: 评估了13个LLMs的800多场对局，结果显示没有模型能击败业余人类水平的Maia-1100，有些甚至无法击败随机玩家。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs在复杂战略推理方面存在显著不足，但通过微调的Qwen3-8B模型性能大幅提升，接近更大规模的最先进推理模型。

Abstract: Recent large language models (LLMs) have shown strong reasoning capabilities.
However, a critical question remains: do these models possess genuine reasoning
skills particularly complex strategic reasoning or are they primarily excelling
at sophisticated pattern recognition within their training data? To address
this question, this paper presents a chess testbed, ChessArena, to evaluate the
strategic reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Chess requires complex strategic
reasoning capabilities including long-term planning, strict rule comprehension,
and multi-turn conversation memorization. Specifically, ChessArena is a
competitive framework where LLMs play against each other, under four different
play modes. The testbed is equipped with a ranking algorithm and a leaderboard.
The testbed can also evaluate fine-grained capabilities including basic
understanding, move selection, and puzzle solving. Over 13 LLMs with different
modes are evaluated in ChessArena, playing over 800 games. The results reveal
significant shortcomings in current LLMs: no model can beat Maia-1100 (a chess
engine at human amateur level), while some even failed to defeat a random
player that selects moves arbitrarily. We also present a strong baseline to the
testbed: our fine-tuned Qwen3-8B substantially improved performance,
approaching much larger state-of-the-art reasoning models.

Motivation: 将预训练-迁移范式扩展到图结构的运筹学问题面临挑战，因为语言的统计灵活性与图的严格组合约束之间存在根本冲突。

Method: 通过在图上随机游走生成的路径上进行自监督预训练，使GFM能够内化图的复杂拓扑和组合规则，将结构连通性本身作为监督信号。

Result: 在20到893个节点的网络上进行的综合实验表明，GFM在各种不同的优化任务类别中与专业求解器相比具有竞争力，同时保持显著更快的推理时间。

Conclusion: 这项工作建立了将预训练-迁移框架适应于图优化的新范式，为将基础模型创新应用于运筹学打开了大门。

Abstract: The pretrain-transfer paradigm, which underpins the success of large language
models (LLMs), has demonstrated the immense power of creating foundation models
that learn generalizable representations from vast datasets. However, extending
this paradigm to Operations Research (OR) problems on graph structures remains
challenging due to the fundamental conflict between the statistical flexibility
of language and the strict combinatorial constraints of graphs. To bridge this
gap, we introduce the Graph Foundation Model (GFM), the first framework capable
of solving all distance-based optimization problems on graph structures. By
introducing the LLM-like self-supervised pre-training paradigm on the paths
generated from random walks in the graph, GFM is compelled to internalize the
graph's complex topological and combinatorial rules, where the connectivity of
the structure itself can be treated as the supervisory signal. Unlike existing
neural methods that learn complex and task-specific solving policies, our
approach leverages the pre-trained GFM as a foundational model of the graph's
intrinsic structure, which in turn enables a simple generative heuristic to
tackle a diverse range of optimization challenges effectively. Comprehensive
experiments on networks ranging from 20 to 893 nodes demonstrate that GFM
achieves competitive performance against specialized solvers across a variety
of distinct optimization task classes, while maintaining significantly faster
inference times. Our work establishes a new paradigm of adapting the
pretrain-transfer framework to graph optimization, opening the door for
applying foundation model innovations to OR.

Motivation: ESP作弊难以检测，因为其效果在玩家行为中不可直接观察，缺乏可靠标记数据，且作弊者会调整行为来伪装作弊使用。

Method: 使用强化学习代理建模作弊者和非作弊者，具有不同的可观察性水平，检测器对其行为轨迹进行分类。将作弊者与检测器的交互建模为对抗性游戏，引入结构化作弊者模型动态切换作弊和非作弊行为。

Result: 实验表明该框架成功模拟了自适应作弊行为，能够策略性地平衡奖励优化和检测规避。

Conclusion: 这项工作为研究自适应作弊行为和开发有效作弊检测器提供了一个可控且可扩展的平台。

Abstract: Extra-Sensory Perception (ESP) cheats, which reveal hidden in-game
information such as enemy locations, are difficult to detect because their
effects are not directly observable in player behavior. The lack of observable
evidence makes it difficult to collect reliably labeled data, which is
essential for training effective anti-cheat systems. Furthermore, cheaters
often adapt their behavior by limiting or disguising their cheat usage, which
further complicates detection and detector development. To address these
challenges, we propose a simulation framework for controlled modeling of ESP
cheaters, non-cheaters, and trajectory-based detectors. We model cheaters and
non-cheaters as reinforcement learning agents with different levels of
observability, while detectors classify their behavioral trajectories. Next, we
formulate the interaction between the cheater and the detector as an
adversarial game, allowing both players to co-adapt over time. To reflect
realistic cheater strategies, we introduce a structured cheater model that
dynamically switches between cheating and non-cheating behaviors based on
detection risk. Experiments demonstrate that our framework successfully
simulates adaptive cheater behaviors that strategically balance reward
optimization and detection evasion. This work provides a controllable and
extensible platform for studying adaptive cheating behaviors and developing
effective cheat detectors.

Conclusion: 首次分析表明显式任务指令作为语义先验，引导EEG嵌入进入连贯且基于语言的空间中，增强了EEG表征的鲁棒性和可迁移性。

Abstract: Recent advances in electroencephalography (EEG) foundation models, which
capture transferable EEG representations, have greatly accelerated the
development of brain-computer interfaces (BCI). However, existing approaches
still struggle to incorporate language instructions as prior constraints for
EEG representation learning, limiting their ability to leverage the semantic
knowledge inherent in language to unify different labels and tasks. To address
this challenge, we present ELASTIQ, a foundation model for EEG-Language
Alignment with Semantic Task Instruction and Querying. ELASTIQ integrates
task-aware semantic guidance to produce structured and linguistically aligned
EEG embeddings, thereby enhancing decoding robustness and transferability. In
the pretraining stage, we introduce a joint Spectral-Temporal Reconstruction
(STR) module, which combines frequency masking as a global spectral
perturbation with two complementary temporal objectives: random masking to
capture contextual dependencies and causal masking to model sequential
dynamics. In the instruction tuning stage, we propose the
Instruction-conditioned Q-Former (IQF), a query-based cross-attention
transformer that injects instruction embeddings into EEG tokens and aligns them
with textual label embeddings through learnable queries. We evaluate ELASTIQ on
20 datasets spanning motor imagery, emotion recognition, steady-state visual
evoked potentials, covert speech, and healthcare tasks. ELASTIQ achieves
state-of-the-art performance on 14 of the 20 datasets and obtains the best
average results across all five task categories. Importantly, our analyses
reveal for the first time that explicit task instructions serve as semantic
priors guiding EEG embeddings into coherent and linguistically grounded spaces.
The code and pre-trained weights will be released.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分布式强化学习方法在异构异步计算和通信瓶颈存在的情况下研究较少，需要开发能够有效处理这些挑战的算法。

Method: 设计了两种新算法：Rennala NIGT在均匀设置下支持AllReduce操作，Malenia NIGT在异构设置下同时处理异步计算和异构环境。

Result: 在均匀设置下，Rennala NIGT显著提高了总计算和通信复杂度；在异构设置下，Malenia NIGT具有更好的理论保证，实验表明两种方法都显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 提出的两种分布式强化学习算法在异步并行环境中表现出色，为处理异构计算和通信瓶颈提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: We study distributed reinforcement learning (RL) with policy gradient methods
under asynchronous and parallel computations and communications. While
non-distributed methods are well understood theoretically and have achieved
remarkable empirical success, their distributed counterparts remain less
explored, particularly in the presence of heterogeneous asynchronous
computations and communication bottlenecks. We introduce two new algorithms,
Rennala NIGT and Malenia NIGT, which implement asynchronous policy gradient
aggregation and achieve state-of-the-art efficiency. In the homogeneous
setting, Rennala NIGT provably improves the total computational and
communication complexity while supporting the AllReduce operation. In the
heterogeneous setting, Malenia NIGT simultaneously handles asynchronous
computations and heterogeneous environments with strictly better theoretical
guarantees. Our results are further corroborated by experiments, showing that
our methods significantly outperform prior approaches.

TL;DR: 本研究使用基于通用微分方程的科学机器学习框架预测土壤有机碳动态，在无噪声和中等噪声条件下表现优异，但在高噪声条件下出现过拟合或过度平滑的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 土壤有机碳是土壤健康和全球气候韧性的基础，但由于复杂的物理、化学和生物过程，其预测仍然困难。

Method: 采用基于通用微分方程的科学机器学习框架，将机械物理（如平流扩散传输）与学习非线性微生物生产和呼吸的神经网络相结合，使用合成数据集系统评估六个实验案例。

Result: 在无噪声和7%噪声条件下表现优异（MSE=1.6e-5，R2=0.9999；MSE=3.4e-6，R2=0.99998），但在35%噪声条件下出现过拟合（R2=0.94）或过度平滑（负R2）的问题。

Conclusion: 通用微分方程适用于可扩展、噪声容忍的土壤有机碳预测，但向野外部署推进需要噪声感知损失函数、概率建模和更紧密的微生物动力学集成。

Abstract: Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) is a foundation of soil health and global climate
resilience, yet its prediction remains difficult because of intricate physical,
chemical, and biological processes. In this study, we explore a Scientific
Machine Learning (SciML) framework built on Universal Differential Equations
(UDEs) to forecast SOC dynamics across soil depth and time. UDEs blend
mechanistic physics, such as advection diffusion transport, with neural
networks that learn nonlinear microbial production and respiration. Using
synthetic datasets, we systematically evaluated six experimental cases,
progressing from clean, noise free benchmarks to stress tests with high (35%)
multiplicative, spatially correlated noise. Our results highlight both the
potential and limitations of the approach. In noise free and moderate noise
settings, the UDE accurately reconstructed SOC dynamics. In clean terminal
profile at 50 years (Case 4) achieved near perfect fidelity, with MSE = 1.6e-5,
and R2 = 0.9999. Case 5, with 7% noise, remained robust (MSE = 3.4e-6, R2 =
0.99998), capturing depth wise SOC trends while tolerating realistic
measurement uncertainty. In contrast, Case 3 (35% noise at t = 0) showed clear
evidence of overfitting: the model reproduced noisy inputs with high accuracy
but lost generalization against the clean truth (R2 = 0.94). Case 6 (35% noise
at t = 50) collapsed toward overly smooth mean profiles, failing to capture
depth wise variability and yielding negative R2, underscoring the limits of
standard training under severe uncertainty. These findings suggest that UDEs
are well suited for scalable, noise tolerant SOC forecasting, though advancing
toward field deployment will require noise aware loss functions, probabilistic
modelling, and tighter integration of microbial dynamics.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SALT提出了一种两阶段无正则化视频表示学习方法，使用冻结的教师网络替代EMA更新，在保持表示泛化能力的同时提高了透明度和计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的V-JEPA方法使用EMA更新的教师网络来防止表示崩溃，但这使得模型选择复杂化并耦合了师生架构。作者希望探索更简单、可扩展的替代方案。

Method: 两阶段方法：首先用像素重建目标训练教师编码器，然后冻结教师，训练学生网络在掩码区域预测教师的潜在表示。

Result: SALT学生模型在多个基准测试中优于V-JEPA 2编码器，计算效率更高，在相同FLOPs下获得更高的探测精度，且学生质量对教师质量具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: SALT为基于EMA的自蒸馏提供了一种简单、可扩展且计算高效的替代方案，建议将计算预算主要分配给学生网络。

Abstract: Video Joint Embedding Predictive Architectures (V-JEPA) learn generalizable
off-the-shelf video representation by predicting masked regions in latent space
with an exponential moving average (EMA)-updated teacher. While EMA prevents
representation collapse, it complicates scalable model selection and couples
teacher and student architectures. We revisit masked-latent prediction and show
that a frozen teacher suffices. Concretely, we (i) train a target encoder with
a simple pixel-reconstruction objective under V-JEPA masking, then (ii) freeze
it and train a student to predict the teacher's latents on masked regions. This
leads to a two-stage, unregularized scheme that we refer to as SALT
(Static-teacher Asymmetric Latent Training). SALT decouples optimization into
pixel reconstruction (teacher) and masked latent prediction (student),
increasing transparency, efficiency, and scalability while preserving the
ability of representation to generalize under frozen evaluation. Empirically,
our student models outperform recently proposed V-JEPA 2 encoders under frozen
backbone evaluation across diverse benchmarks. They are also more
compute-optimal: at matched pretraining FLOPs, our method achieves higher
probing accuracy, and its scaling curves dominate V-JEPA's accuracy-FLOPs
Pareto frontier. Finally, we find that student quality is remarkably robust to
teacher quality: high-performing students emerge even with small, sub-optimal
teachers. This points to a compute budget allocation that should overwhelmingly
favor the student. These results position SALT as a simple, scalable, and
compute-efficient alternative to EMA-based self-distillation for video
representation learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出AuON优化器，通过非线性缩放和归一化在线性时间内实现半正交动量更新，避免了传统正交化方法的高计算成本，性能与AdamW和Muon相当。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统正交梯度更新方法计算成本高（O(n^3)），且动量应用受限；现有改进方法如Muon仍存在二次复杂度瓶颈。

Method: 利用动量更新的半正交特性，在谱范数信任域内约束动量更新，结合双曲余弦RMS缩放变换和归一化，避免显式半正交化矩阵构造。

Result: 在视觉和语言基准测试中，AuON及其混合变体性能与AdamW和Muon等强基线相当。

Conclusion: AuON提供了一种计算高效的替代方案，无需构造半正交矩阵即可实现强性能，同时保持结构对齐和重新调节病态更新。

Abstract: Orthogonal gradient updates have emerged as a promising direction in
optimization for machine learning. However, traditional approaches such as
SVD/QR decomposition incur prohibitive computational costs of O(n^3) and
underperform compared to well-tuned SGD with momentum, since momentum is
applied only after strict orthogonalization. Recent advances, such as Muon,
improve efficiency by applying momentum before orthogonalization and producing
semi-orthogonal matrices via Newton-Schulz iterations, reducing complexity to
O(n^2). Nevertheless, quadratic costs remain a bottleneck.
  In this work, we study the semi-orthogonal properties of momentum-based
updates and develop a method to bound momentum updates under a spectral-norm
trust region, preserving directional information without requiring explicit
semi-orthogonalization.
  We propose AuON (Alternative Unit-norm momentum updates by Normalized
nonlinear scaling), a linear-time optimizer that achieves strong performance
without constructing semi-orthogonal matrices, while preserving structural
alignment and reconditioning ill-posed updates. Our approach combines
hyperbolic-cosine RMS scaling transformations with normalization, demonstrating
both effectiveness and computational efficiency compared to Newton-Schulz
methods. We further introduce a hybrid variant (Hybrid-AuON) that applies a
single Newton-Schulz iteration. Experiments across vision and language
benchmarks show that AuON and its hybrid variant achieve performance comparable
to strong baselines such as AdamW and Muon.

TL;DR: 提出H+方法，一种新颖的相似性感知聚合方法，在联邦学习中有效防御拜占庭攻击，无需依赖干净数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习容易受到拜占庭攻击，现有基于相似性的方法需要干净数据，但在实际中干净数据往往不可得。

Method: H+随机选择参数向量的r维片段，使用相似性检查函数H与参考向量比较，保留最相似的客户端向量进行聚合，重复K次识别诚实客户端。

Result: H+在多种拜占庭攻击比例和类型下，在所有评估场景和基准数据集上都表现出最先进的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: H+是一种高效、通用的联邦学习防御方法，无需干净数据即可有效防御拜占庭攻击，计算复杂度低。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables decentralized model training without sharing
raw data. However, it remains vulnerable to Byzantine attacks, which can
compromise the aggregation of locally updated parameters at the central server.
Similarity-aware aggregation has emerged as an effective strategy to mitigate
such attacks by identifying and filtering out malicious clients based on
similarity between client model parameters and those derived from clean data,
i.e., data that is uncorrupted and trustworthy. However, existing methods adopt
this strategy only in FL systems with clean data, making them inapplicable to
settings where such data is unavailable. In this paper, we propose H+, a novel
similarity-aware aggregation approach that not only outperforms existing
methods in scenarios with clean data, but also extends applicability to FL
systems without any clean data. Specifically, H+ randomly selects
$r$-dimensional segments from the $p$-dimensional parameter vectors uploaded to
the server and applies a similarity check function $H$ to compare each segment
against a reference vector, preserving the most similar client vectors for
aggregation. The reference vector is derived either from existing robust
algorithms when clean data is unavailable or directly from clean data.
Repeating this process $K$ times enables effective identification of honest
clients. Moreover, H+ maintains low computational complexity, with an
analytical time complexity of $\mathcal{O}(KMr)$, where $M$ is the number of
clients and $Kr \ll p$. Comprehensive experiments validate H+ as a
state-of-the-art (SOTA) method, demonstrating substantial robustness
improvements over existing approaches under varying Byzantine attack ratios and
multiple types of traditional Byzantine attacks, across all evaluated scenarios
and benchmark datasets.

TL;DR: 提出iMOOE方法，通过物理引导的不变学习来提升PDE系统在未知分布场景下的零样本泛化能力，无需额外测试样本进行领域适应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在PDE系统参数多变的情况下，零样本OOD泛化能力不足，仍需测试样本进行领域适应，因为尚未充分研究或整合PDE动力学系统中的基本物理不变性。

Method: 首先明确定义了PDE不变性原理，指出成分算子及其组合关系在不同领域和PDE系统演化中保持不变；然后提出iMOOE方法，包含不变性对齐的算子专家混合架构和频率增强的不变学习目标。

Result: 在模拟基准和实际应用中进行的广泛实验验证了iMOOE在分布内性能的优越性以及在多样化OOD预测场景下的零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: iMOOE通过捕获PDE系统的两重不变性，显著提升了在未见OOD场景下的零样本预测性能，为物理动力学系统的泛化预测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Advanced deep learning-based approaches have been actively applied to
forecast the spatiotemporal physical dynamics governed by partial differential
equations (PDEs), which acts as a critical procedure in tackling many science
and engineering problems. As real-world physical environments like PDE system
parameters are always capricious, how to generalize across unseen
out-of-distribution (OOD) forecasting scenarios using limited training data is
of great importance. To bridge this barrier, existing methods focus on
discovering domain-generalizable representations across various PDE dynamics
trajectories. However, their zero-shot OOD generalization capability remains
deficient, since extra test-time samples for domain-specific adaptation are
still required. This is because the fundamental physical invariance in PDE
dynamical systems are yet to be investigated or integrated. To this end, we
first explicitly define a two-fold PDE invariance principle, which points out
that ingredient operators and their composition relationships remain invariant
across different domains and PDE system evolution. Next, to capture this
two-fold PDE invariance, we propose a physics-guided invariant learning method
termed iMOOE, featuring an Invariance-aligned Mixture Of Operator Expert
architecture and a frequency-enriched invariant learning objective. Extensive
experiments across simulated benchmarks and real-world applications validate
iMOOE's superior in-distribution performance and zero-shot generalization
capabilities on diverse OOD forecasting scenarios.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种多目标进化学习框架，用于在游戏关卡生成中同时优化多个多样性指标，通过将模型训练构建为多目标学习问题来增强多维度多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有游戏关卡生成方法往往无法全面评估多维度多样性指标，这些指标之间存在冲突、互补或混合关系，需要更全面的多样性评估方法。

Method: 提出多目标进化学习框架，将每个多样性指标视为独立目标，在模型训练过程中同时优化多个多样性指标，识别生成模型的帕累托前沿。

Result: 在超级马里奥兄弟基准测试中，该框架成功增强了多维度多样性，并提供了在可玩性和两个代表性多样性指标（基于内容的和玩家中心的）之间的权衡范围。

Conclusion: 该框架能够为决策者提供一系列生成器选择，满足不同场景和玩家、设计师的多样化需求，实现更明智的生成器选择。

Abstract: In recent years, the generation of diverse game levels has gained increasing
interest, contributing to a richer and more engaging gaming experience. A
number of level diversity metrics have been proposed in literature, which are
naturally multi-dimensional, leading to conflicted, complementary, or both
relationships among these dimensions. However, existing level generation
approaches often fail to comprehensively assess diversity across those
dimensions. This paper aims to expand horizons of level diversity by
considering multi-dimensional diversity when training generative models. We
formulate the model training as a multi-objective learning problem, where each
diversity metric is treated as a distinct objective. Furthermore, a
multi-objective evolutionary learning framework that optimises multiple
diversity metrics simultaneously throughout the model training process is
proposed. Our case study on the commonly used benchmark Super Mario Bros.
demonstrates that our proposed framework can enhance multi-dimensional
diversity and identify a Pareto front of generative models, which provides a
range of tradeoffs among playability and two representative diversity metrics,
including a content-based one and a player-centered one. Such capability
enables decision-makers to make informed choices when selecting generators
accommodating a variety of scenarios and the diverse needs of players and
designers.

*Thibaud Gloaguen,Robin Staab,Nikola Jovanović,Martin Vechev*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了首个专门为扩散语言模型设计的水印方案，解决了传统自回归语言模型水印方法无法直接应用于DLM的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散语言模型能够以任意顺序生成token，这与标准自回归语言模型按顺序生成token的方式不同。现有的ARLM水印方案依赖先前生成的token，这在DLM生成中并不总是可用。

Method: 通过两种方式解决挑战：(i)在上下文token尚未完全确定时，在期望值上应用水印；(ii)促进那些作为其他token上下文时能增强水印强度的token。同时保持水印检测器不变。

Result: 实验评估显示，DLM水印实现了>99%的真阳性率，对质量影响极小，并且与现有ARLM水印具有相似的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 这项工作首次实现了可靠的扩散语言模型水印，为DLM提供了有效的版权保护方案。

Abstract: We introduce the first watermark tailored for diffusion language models
(DLMs), an emergent LLM paradigm able to generate tokens in arbitrary order, in
contrast to standard autoregressive language models (ARLMs) which generate
tokens sequentially. While there has been much work in ARLM watermarking, a key
challenge when attempting to apply these schemes directly to the DLM setting is
that they rely on previously generated tokens, which are not always available
with DLM generation. In this work we address this challenge by: (i) applying
the watermark in expectation over the context even when some context tokens are
yet to be determined, and (ii) promoting tokens which increase the watermark
strength when used as context for other tokens. This is accomplished while
keeping the watermark detector unchanged. Our experimental evaluation
demonstrates that the DLM watermark leads to a >99% true positive rate with
minimal quality impact and achieves similar robustness to existing ARLM
watermarks, enabling for the first time reliable DLM watermarking.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本研究成功将进化策略(ES)扩展到大规模语言模型(LLM)的全参数微调，证明ES在数十亿参数规模下仍能高效搜索，并在多个方面优于强化学习(RL)微调方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管进化策略(ES)曾在百万参数模型上表现出与强化学习(RL)相当的性能，但由于对其扩展到更大模型的悲观预期而被忽视。本研究旨在重新评估ES在大规模LLM微调中的潜力。

Method: 采用进化策略(ES)对预训练LLM进行全参数微调，探索其在数十亿参数规模下的可行性。

Result: ES在样本效率、长时程奖励容忍度、对不同基础LLM的鲁棒性、奖励破解倾向性以及跨运行稳定性等多个方面均优于现有RL微调方法。

Conclusion: ES为LLM微调开辟了超越当前RL技术的新方向，证明了其在数十亿参数规模下的有效性和优势。

Abstract: Fine-tuning pre-trained large language models (LLMs) for down-stream tasks is
a critical step in the AI deployment pipeline. Reinforcement learning (RL) is
arguably the most prominent fine-tuning method, contributing to the birth of
many state-of-the-art LLMs. In contrast, evolution strategies (ES), which once
showed comparable performance to RL on models with a few million parameters,
was neglected due to the pessimistic perception of its scalability to larger
models. In this work, we report the first successful attempt to scale up ES for
fine-tuning the full parameters of LLMs, showing the surprising fact that ES
can search efficiently over billions of parameters and outperform existing RL
fine-tuning methods in multiple respects, including sample efficiency,
tolerance to long-horizon rewards, robustness to different base LLMs, less
tendency to reward hacking, and more stable performance across runs. It
therefore serves as a basis to unlock a new direction in LLM fine-tuning beyond
what current RL techniques provide. The source codes are provided at:

*Tian Lan,Hao Duong Le,Jinbo Li,Wenjun He,Meng Wang,Chenghao Liu,Chen Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AXIS框架通过为冻结的LLM提供三种互补提示（数值符号提示、上下文集成提示、任务先验提示）来解决时间序列异常检测中的解释性问题，避免直接序列化带来的模态对齐问题，并在新基准测试中展现出优越的解释质量和检测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时间序列异常检测需要不仅检测异常，还要解释异常模式和原因。现有方法将时间序列作为文本处理，但LLM难以直接处理长连续信号，导致缺乏上下文基础和模态对齐。

Method: AXIS框架不直接序列化时间序列，而是为冻结的LLM提供三种提示：(i) 符号数值提示用于数值基础，(ii) 从预训练时间序列编码器提取的上下文集成、步长对齐提示捕获细粒度动态，(iii) 任务先验提示编码全局异常特征。

Result: 在包含多格式问题和原理的新基准测试中，AXIS产生显著更高质量的解释，并在检测精度上与通用LLM、专用时间序列LLM和时间序列视觉语言模型相比具有竞争力。

Conclusion: AXIS通过多模态提示机制有效解决了时间序列异常检测的解释性问题，在解释质量和检测精度方面均表现优异，为可解释时间序列分析提供了新思路。

Abstract: Time-series anomaly detection (TSAD) increasingly demands explanations that
articulate not only if an anomaly occurred, but also what pattern it exhibits
and why it is anomalous. Leveraging the impressive explanatory capabilities of
Large Language Models (LLMs), recent works have attempted to treat time series
as text for explainable TSAD. However, this approach faces a fundamental
challenge: LLMs operate on discrete tokens and struggle to directly process
long, continuous signals. Consequently, naive time-to-text serialization
suffers from a lack of contextual grounding and representation alignment
between the two modalities. To address this gap, we introduce AXIS, a framework
that conditions a frozen LLM for nuanced time-series understanding. Instead of
direct serialization, AXIS enriches the LLM's input with three complementary
hints derived from the series: (i) a symbolic numeric hint for numerical
grounding, (ii) a context-integrated, step-aligned hint distilled from a
pretrained time-series encoder to capture fine-grained dynamics, and (iii) a
task-prior hint that encodes global anomaly characteristics. Furthermore, to
facilitate robust evaluation of explainability, we introduce a new benchmark
featuring multi-format questions and rationales that supervise contextual
grounding and pattern-level semantics. Extensive experiments, including both
LLM-based and human evaluations, demonstrate that AXIS yields explanations of
significantly higher quality and achieves competitive detection accuracy
compared to general-purpose LLMs, specialized time-series LLMs, and time-series
Vision Language Models.

TL;DR: Muon优化器在训练中小型解码器（30M-200M参数）时，相比AdamW可节省48-52%的计算量，同时保持或改善最终困惑度。与MLA和MoE结合时，能实现68%内存减少和3.2倍推理加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究Muon优化器的理论基础和实际性能，特别是在与现代化架构优化技术协同作用时的表现，旨在提供比AdamW更高效、更稳健的替代方案。

Method: 结合理论分析和实证研究：包括收敛性分析、谱正则化特性、Stiefel流形上的自然梯度下降等价性，以及在15种架构和优化器组件上的详细实验。

Result: Muon在保持数据效率的同时扩展了计算-时间帕累托边界，与MLA+MoE结合时实现68%内存减少、3.2倍推理加速和8-12%困惑度改善。

Conclusion: Muon是一个有理论基础、稳健的AdamW替代方案，特别在与现代化效率技术和大批量训练机制结合时表现优异。

Abstract: We present a comprehensive theoretical and empirical study of the Muon
optimizer for training transformers only with a small to medium decoder (30M -
200M parameters), with an emphasis on its mathematical foundations, convergence
properties and synergistic interactions with modern architectural
optimizations. Building on recent work showing Muon's scalability, we provide
rigorous theoretical analysis including: (i)showing the convergence rate under
standard assumptions, (ii) spectral regularization properties that prevent
gradient explosion, (iii) connection to natural gradient descent on the Stiefel
manifold, and (iv) equivalence to steepest gradient descent under the spectral
norm. Crucially, we demonstrate that Muon expands the Pareto frontier in the
compute-time trade-off by maintaining superior data efficiency at large batch
sizes, a key finding of~\cite{essentialai2025muon} that we validate across our
model scales. Empirically, Muon reaches the target loss with 48-52\% of the
training calculated by AdamW while maintaining or improving the final
perplexity, consistent with larger-scale results. When combined with Multi-Head
Latent Attention (MLA) and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), we observe multiplicative
efficiency gains: MLA+MoE+Muon achieves 68\% memory reduction and 3.2$\times$
inference speedup, while improving perplexity by 8-12\%. We provide detailed
procedures on 15 architectural and optimizer components, stability analyzes
across 100+ training runs, and practical implementation guidelines including
Newton-Schulz coefficients $(3.4445, -4.7750, 2.0315)$ optimized
by~\cite{su2024muonblog}. Our theoretical analysis and comprehensive
experiments establish Muon as a principled, robust alternative to AdamW that
particularly excels when combined with modern efficiency techniques and
large-batch training regimes.

Conclusion: 通过最大化时间和拓扑视图之间的条件互信息，可以改善跨视图一致性并增强更具区分性的表示，有效提升异常检测性能。

Abstract: One main challenge in time series anomaly detection for industrial IoT lies
in the complex spatio-temporal couplings within multivariate data. However,
traditional anomaly detection methods focus on modeling spatial or temporal
dependencies independently, resulting in suboptimal representation learning and
limited sensitivity to anomalous dispersion in high-dimensional spaces. In this
work, we conduct an empirical analysis showing that both normal and anomalous
samples tend to scatter in high-dimensional space, especially anomalous samples
are markedly more dispersed. We formalize this dispersion phenomenon as
scattering, quantified by the mean pairwise distance among sample
representations, and leverage it as an inductive signal to enhance
spatio-temporal anomaly detection. Technically, we propose ScatterAD to model
representation scattering across temporal and topological dimensions. ScatterAD
incorporates a topological encoder for capturing graph-structured scattering
and a temporal encoder for constraining over-scattering through mean squared
error minimization between neighboring time steps. We introduce a contrastive
fusion mechanism to ensure the complementarity of the learned temporal and
topological representations. Additionally, we theoretically show that
maximizing the conditional mutual information between temporal and topological
views improves cross-view consistency and enhances more discriminative
representations. Extensive experiments on multiple public benchmarks show that
ScatterAD achieves state-of-the-art performance on multivariate time series
anomaly detection. Code is available at this repository:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 物联网设备产生大量多变量时间序列数据，需要在资源受限的边缘环境中进行高效准确处理。HD计算虽然高效但难以捕捉复杂时间模式，而Transformer擅长序列建模但计算和内存开销大。

Method: 提出BiHDTrans模型，将自注意力机制集成到HD计算范式中，在超维空间中进行二元化，利用高维表示的独立同分布特性，并在FPGA上进行硬件加速。

Result: BiHDTrans比最先进的HD计算模型准确率至少提高14.47%，比最先进的二元Transformer平均准确率高6.67%。FPGA加速实现比最先进二元Transformer推理延迟降低39.4倍。即使超维维度减少64%，仍保持竞争力，模型大小减少4.4倍，延迟进一步降低49.8%。

Conclusion: BiHDTrans成功弥合了Transformer的表达能力和HD计算效率之间的差距，为资源受限的边缘环境提供了准确、可扩展和低延迟的多变量时间序列分类解决方案。

Abstract: The proliferation of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices has led to an
unprecedented volume of multivariate time series (MTS) data, requiring
efficient and accurate processing for timely decision-making in
resource-constrained edge environments. Hyperdimensional (HD) computing, with
its inherent efficiency and parallelizability, has shown promise in
classification tasks but struggles to capture complex temporal patterns, while
Transformers excel at sequence modeling but incur high computational and memory
overhead. We introduce BiHDTrans, an efficient neurosymbolic binary
hyperdimensional Transformer that integrates self-attention into the HD
computing paradigm, unifying the representational efficiency of HD computing
with the temporal modeling power of Transformers. Empirically, BiHDTrans
outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) HD computing models by at least 14.47% and
achieves 6.67% higher accuracy on average than SOTA binary Transformers. With
hardware acceleration on FPGA, our pipelined implementation leverages the
independent and identically distributed properties of high-dimensional
representations, delivering 39.4 times lower inference latency than SOTA binary
Transformers. Theoretical analysis shows that binarizing in holographic
high-dimensional space incurs significantly less information distortion than
directly binarizing neural networks, explaining BiHDTrans's superior accuracy.
Furthermore, dimensionality experiments confirm that BiHDTrans remains
competitive even with a 64% reduction in hyperspace dimensionality, surpassing
SOTA binary Transformers by 1-2% in accuracy with 4.4 times less model size, as
well as further reducing the latency by 49.8% compare to the full-dimensional
baseline. Together, these contributions bridge the gap between the
expressiveness of Transformers and the efficiency of HD computing, enabling
accurate, scalable, and low-latency MTS classification.

Motivation: 多模态表示学习产生的高维嵌入虽然具有强大的泛化能力，但也带来了存储和下游处理的可扩展性挑战。需要找到在减少嵌入内存占用的同时，保持跨模态共享语义内容表示能力的方法。

Method: 提出一种基于模态对齐的语义压缩方法，当模态间差距足够小时，不同模态但表达相同语义的嵌入共享空间中的共同部分，因此可以用单个质心替换多个嵌入，实现显著的内存节省。该方法直接在预训练编码器上操作。

Conclusion: 模态对齐是实现语义压缩的关键推动因素，所提出的方法在保持性能的同时实现了显著的压缩效果。

Abstract: Multimodal representation learning produces high-dimensional embeddings that
align diverse modalities in a shared latent space. While this enables strong
generalization, it also introduces scalability challenges, both in terms of
storage and downstream processing. A key open problem is how to achieve
semantic compression, reducing the memory footprint of multimodal embeddings
while preserving their ability to represent shared semantic content across
modalities. In this paper, we prove a strong connection between reducing the
modality gap, which is the residual separation of embeddings from different
modalities, and the feasibility of post-training semantic compression. When the
gap is sufficiently reduced, embeddings from different modalities but
expressing the same semantics share a common portion of the space. Therefore,
their centroid is a faithful representation of such a semantic concept. This
enables replacing multiple embeddings with a single centroid, yielding
significant memory savings. We propose a novel approach for semantic
compression grounded on the latter intuition, operating directly on pretrained
encoders. We demonstrate its effectiveness across diverse large-scale
multimodal downstream tasks. Our results highlight that modality alignment is a
key enabler for semantic compression, showing that the proposed approach
achieves significant compression without sacrificing performance.

*Yingshi Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于训练大语言模型的进化框架，通过将模型划分为多个专家子网络，每次只训练一个专家，并结合进化算子来加速训练过程，显著减少内存需求并提高训练吞吐量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型训练过程中内存需求大、训练速度慢的问题，同时保持模型性能，使模型更适合在PC和边缘计算设备上部署。

Method: 将模型划分为多个结构相同但参数不同的专家子网络，每次只训练一个专家，在AdamW优化后应用交叉、粒子群优化和变异等进化算子，让当前专家学习最佳专家的经验。

Result: 最佳专家能达到与完整模型几乎相同的准确率，训练吞吐量提升超过10倍，同时大大减少了推理时的模型大小。

Conclusion: 该进化框架能有效减少大语言模型的训练内存需求，显著提高训练速度，同时保持模型性能，适合在资源受限的设备上部署。

Abstract: This paper presents an evolutionary framework for the training of large
language models(LLM). The models are divided into several
experts(sub-networks), which have the same structure but different parameter
values. Only one expert is trained at each step. After the classical AdamW
optimization, some evolutionary operators(crossover, PSO, and mutation) act on
the tensor weights between the current expert and the best expert. So current
expert would learn the experience of best expert. The direction of best expert
would help current expert's loss decrease faster. Finally, only save the weight
of the best expert. Experiments show that best expert would achieve nearly the
same accuracy as the full model. This would greatly reduce the size of the
model for inference. Since only one expert is trained at each step, the
training needs much less memory and has much higher throughput. Experiments
show that the throughput would accelerate more than ten times! Our source code
is available. It's a pure c++/cu framework, which is suitable for easy
deployment on PCs and edge computing devices.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习在数据分布扰动下性能会显著下降，现有基于分布鲁棒优化的方法往往忽略了局部数据集中异常值对学习模型的负面影响。

Method: 引入基于不平衡Wasserstein距离的模糊集，结合几何分布偏移和非几何KL惩罚，将问题重构为可处理的拉格朗日惩罚优化，并提出了分布异常值鲁棒联邦学习算法。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的广泛实验验证了该方法的有效性，算法具有收敛保证。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效处理联邦学习中的数据分布扰动和异常值问题，提供鲁棒性保证。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training without direct
data sharing, but its performance can degrade significantly in the presence of
data distribution perturbations. Distributionally robust optimization (DRO)
provides a principled framework for handling this by optimizing performance
against the worst-case distributions within a prescribed ambiguity set.
However, existing DRO-based FL methods often overlook the detrimental impact of
outliers in local datasets, which can disproportionately bias the learned
models. In this work, we study distributionally robust federated learning with
explicit outlier resilience. We introduce a novel ambiguity set based on the
unbalanced Wasserstein distance, which jointly captures geometric
distributional shifts and incorporates a non-geometric Kullback--Leibler
penalization to mitigate the influence of outliers. This formulation naturally
leads to a challenging min--max--max optimization problem. To enable
decentralized training, we reformulate the problem as a tractable Lagrangian
penalty optimization, which admits robustness certificates. Building on this
reformulation, we propose the distributionally outlier-robust federated
learning algorithm and establish its convergence guarantees. Extensive
experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 核方法虽然理论基础扎实，但在大规模数据上的可扩展性受限，特别是在表示学习领域缺乏可扩展框架，无法适应基础模型时代对大规模无标签数据表示学习的需求。

Method: 使用Nyström近似构建统一的核方法表示学习框架KREPES，支持多种无监督和自监督损失函数。

Result: 在大型图像和表格数据集上的实验证明了KREPES的高效性，并且能够提供学习表示的可解释性分析。

Conclusion: KREPES填补了核方法在可扩展表示学习方面的空白，为核方法在大规模数据上的应用提供了新途径，同时保持了核方法的可解释性优势。

Abstract: Kernel methods provide a theoretically grounded framework for non-linear and
non-parametric learning, with strong analytic foundations and statistical
guarantees. Yet, their scalability has long been limited by prohibitive time
and memory costs. While progress has been made in scaling kernel regression, no
framework exists for scalable kernel-based representation learning, restricting
their use in the era of foundation models where representations are learned
from massive unlabeled data. We introduce KREPES -- a unified, scalable
framework for kernel-based representation learning via Nystr\"om approximation.
KREPES accommodates a wide range of unsupervised and self-supervised losses,
and experiments on large image and tabular datasets demonstrate its efficiency.
Crucially, KREPES enables principled interpretability of the learned
representations, an immediate benefit over deep models, which we substantiate
through dedicated analysis.

TL;DR: 本文提出了FS-KAN（函数共享KAN），一种构建任意排列对称群的等变和不变KA层的原则性方法，统一并显著扩展了该领域先前的工作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然等变KAN在最近文献中针对特定数据类型进行了探索，但在通用背景下对具有排列对称性的数据应用的原则性框架仍然缺失。

Method: 通过将参数共享方案推广到Kolmogorov-Arnold设置，推导这些FS-KAN层的基本构造，并提供理论分析证明FS-KAN具有与标准参数共享层网络相同的表达能力。

Result: 在多种数据类型和对称群上的实证评估表明，FS-KAN在某些情况下比标准参数共享层表现出显著优越的数据效率。

Conclusion: FS-KAN在低数据情况下保持了KAN的可解释性和适应性，使其成为优秀的架构选择。

Abstract: Permutation equivariant neural networks employing parameter-sharing schemes
have emerged as powerful models for leveraging a wide range of data symmetries,
significantly enhancing the generalization and computational efficiency of the
resulting models. Recently, Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have demonstrated
promise through their improved interpretability and expressivity compared to
traditional architectures based on MLPs. While equivariant KANs have been
explored in recent literature for a few specific data types, a principled
framework for applying them to data with permutation symmetries in a general
context remains absent. This paper introduces Function Sharing KAN (FS-KAN), a
principled approach to constructing equivariant and invariant KA layers for
arbitrary permutation symmetry groups, unifying and significantly extending
previous work in this domain. We derive the basic construction of these FS-KAN
layers by generalizing parameter-sharing schemes to the Kolmogorov-Arnold setup
and provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating that FS-KANs have the same
expressive power as networks that use standard parameter-sharing layers,
allowing us to transfer well-known and important expressivity results from
parameter-sharing networks to FS-KANs. Empirical evaluations on multiple data
types and symmetry groups show that FS-KANs exhibit superior data efficiency
compared to standard parameter-sharing layers, by a wide margin in certain
cases, while preserving the interpretability and adaptability of KANs, making
them an excellent architecture choice in low-data regimes.

TL;DR: SMoPE是一个新颖的持续学习框架，通过混合专家架构组织共享提示，实现任务特定提示的性能和共享提示的效率之间的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决持续学习中任务特定提示方法计算开销大、内存需求随任务数量线性增长，而共享提示方法存在知识干扰导致性能下降的问题。

Method: 将共享提示组织为多个提示专家的稀疏MoE架构，通过提示注意力分数聚合机制动态激活相关专家，采用自适应噪声机制平衡专家利用，并使用基于原型的损失函数增强专家专业化。

Result: 在多个持续学习基准测试中，SMoPE始终优于任务特定提示方法，性能与最先进方法相当，同时显著减少参数数量和计算成本。

Conclusion: SMoPE成功平衡了持续学习中性能与效率的权衡，为提示式持续学习提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Prompt-based methods have recently gained prominence in Continual Learning
(CL) due to their strong performance and memory efficiency. A prevalent
strategy in this paradigm assigns a dedicated subset of prompts to each task,
which, while effective, incurs substantial computational overhead and causes
memory requirements to scale linearly with the number of tasks. Conversely,
approaches employing a single shared prompt across tasks offer greater
efficiency but often suffer from degraded performance due to knowledge
interference. To reconcile this trade-off, we propose SMoPE, a novel framework
that integrates the benefits of both task-specific and shared prompt
strategies. Inspired by recent findings on the relationship between Prefix
Tuning and Mixture of Experts (MoE), SMoPE organizes a shared prompt into
multiple "prompt experts" within a sparse MoE architecture. For each input,
only a select subset of relevant experts is activated, effectively mitigating
interference. To facilitate expert selection, we introduce a prompt-attention
score aggregation mechanism that computes a unified proxy score for each
expert, enabling dynamic and sparse activation. Additionally, we propose an
adaptive noise mechanism to encourage balanced expert utilization while
preserving knowledge from prior tasks. To further enhance expert
specialization, we design a prototype-based loss function that leverages prefix
keys as implicit memory representations. Extensive experiments across multiple
CL benchmarks demonstrate that SMoPE consistently outperforms task-specific
prompt methods and achieves performance competitive with state-of-the-art
approaches, all while significantly reducing parameter counts and computational
costs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 可靠的分布偏移不确定性量化是深度学习模型部署的主要障碍。现有方法要么继承错误置信度，要么仅重塑预测，未能教会模型何时应该不确定。

Method: GUIDE通过校准阶段识别显著内部特征，然后使用这些特征构建噪声驱动课程，教会模型如何以及何时表达不确定性。该方法无需重新训练、架构修改或手动中间层选择。

Result: GUIDE避免从基础模型蒸馏过度自信，将分布外检测提高约77%，对抗攻击检测提高约80%，同时保持分布内性能。

Conclusion: GUIDE在多样化基准测试中始终优于最先进方法，证明了主动引导不确定性对于缩小预测置信度与可靠性之间差距的必要性。

Abstract: Reliable uncertainty quantification remains a major obstacle to the
deployment of deep learning models under distributional shift. Existing
post-hoc approaches that retrofit pretrained models either inherit misplaced
confidence or merely reshape predictions, without teaching the model when to be
uncertain. We introduce GUIDE, a lightweight evidential learning meta-model
approach that attaches to a frozen deep learning model and explicitly learns
how and when to be uncertain. GUIDE identifies salient internal features via a
calibration stage, and then employs these features to construct a noise-driven
curriculum that teaches the model how and when to express uncertainty. GUIDE
requires no retraining, no architectural modifications, and no manual
intermediate-layer selection to the base deep learning model, thus ensuring
broad applicability and minimal user intervention. The resulting model avoids
distilling overconfidence from the base model, improves out-of-distribution
detection by ~77% and adversarial attack detection by ~80%, while preserving
in-distribution performance. Across diverse benchmarks, GUIDE consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, evidencing the need for actively
guiding uncertainty to close the gap between predictive confidence and
reliability.

TL;DR: 本文提出LLM DNA概念，作为大语言模型功能行为的低维表示，用于追踪模型间的进化关系，并构建了训练无关的DNA提取流程和进化树。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型数量激增但进化关系不透明，现有方法受限于任务特定性、固定模型集或对分词器/架构的严格假设，需要一种通用方法来追踪模型间的继承关系。

Method: 数学定义LLM DNA为功能行为的低维双Lipschitz表示，证明其满足遗传和遗传决定论性质，并推导出通用、可扩展、训练无关的DNA提取流程。

Result: 在305个LLM上的实验表明，DNA与先前有限子集研究一致，在特定任务上表现优越或具竞争力，并揭示了未记录的模型关系，构建的进化树反映了架构从编码器-解码器到仅解码器的转变、时间进展和不同家族的不同进化速度。

Conclusion: LLM DNA提供了一种通用框架来追踪大语言模型的进化关系，有助于模型管理和理解模型发展历程。

Abstract: The explosive growth of large language models (LLMs) has created a vast but
opaque landscape: millions of models exist, yet their evolutionary
relationships through fine-tuning, distillation, or adaptation are often
undocumented or unclear, complicating LLM management. Existing methods are
limited by task specificity, fixed model sets, or strict assumptions about
tokenizers or architectures. Inspired by biological DNA, we address these
limitations by mathematically defining LLM DNA as a low-dimensional,
bi-Lipschitz representation of functional behavior. We prove that LLM DNA
satisfies inheritance and genetic determinism properties and establish the
existence of DNA. Building on this theory, we derive a general, scalable,
training-free pipeline for DNA extraction. In experiments across 305 LLMs, DNA
aligns with prior studies on limited subsets and achieves superior or
competitive performance on specific tasks. Beyond these tasks, DNA comparisons
uncover previously undocumented relationships among LLMs. We further construct
the evolutionary tree of LLMs using phylogenetic algorithms, which align with
shifts from encoder-decoder to decoder-only architectures, reflect temporal
progression, and reveal distinct evolutionary speeds across LLM families.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究对测试时训练(TTT)为何有效缺乏深入理解，传统解释主要关注分布外适应或特权数据，但随着基础模型规模扩大且大多数测试数据是分布内的，这些解释受到质疑。

Method: 在线性表示假设下建立理论模型，通过稀疏自编码器在ImageNet上验证关键假设，并在图像和语言任务上进行扩展研究。

Result: 理论模型显示TTT能获得比全局训练更小的分布内测试误差，实证验证了语义相关数据点仅由少量共享概念解释，扩展研究确定了专业化最有效的机制。

Conclusion: TTT的有效性源于基础模型的全局欠参数化，通过专业化机制在泛化后聚焦任务相关概念，为理解TTT何时有效提供了新视角。

Abstract: Recent empirical studies have explored the idea of continuing to train a
model at test-time for a given task, known as test-time training (TTT), and
have found it to yield significant performance improvements. However, there is
limited understanding of why and when TTT is effective. Earlier explanations
mostly focused on the observation that TTT may help when applied to
out-of-distribution adaptation or used with privileged data. However, the
growing scale of foundation models with most test data being in-distribution
questions these explanations. We instead posit that foundation models remain
globally underparameterized, with TTT providing a mechanism for specialization
after generalization, focusing capacity on concepts relevant to the test task.
Specifically, under the linear representation hypothesis, we propose a model in
which TTT achieves a substantially smaller in-distribution test error than
global training. We empirically validate our model's key assumptions by
training a sparse autoencoder on ImageNet, showing that semantically related
data points are explained by only a few shared concepts. Finally, we perform
scaling studies across image and language tasks that confirm the practical
implications of our model, identifying the regimes where specialization is most
effective.

Motivation: 现代深度学习过度关注模型效能，导致大规模模型需要大量资源并产生巨大碳足迹。作者希望探索物理归纳偏置如何提供效能与效率之间的有益权衡。

Method: 研究了多种时空预测模型，包括标准物理信息模型和更近期的流匹配模型，通过嵌入不同层次的物理归纳偏置来探索效率与效能的平衡。

Result: 实验表明，嵌入物理归纳偏置可以显著提升模型效率（计算、能耗、碳足迹），同时保持甚至改进任务效能。流匹配模型被证明是时空预测的通用有效方法。

Conclusion: 物理归纳偏置为提高机器学习模型效率和减少碳足迹提供了原则性方法。模型效率应与模型效能一起成为机器学习模型开发和部署的核心考量。

Abstract: Development of modern deep learning methods has been driven primarily by the
push for improving model efficacy (accuracy metrics). This sole focus on
efficacy has steered development of large-scale models that require massive
resources, and results in considerable carbon footprint across the model
life-cycle. In this work, we explore how physics inductive biases can offer
useful trade-offs between model efficacy and model efficiency (compute, energy,
and carbon). We study a variety of models for spatio-temporal forecasting, a
task governed by physical laws and well-suited for exploring different levels
of physics inductive bias. We show that embedding physics inductive biases into
the model design can yield substantial efficiency gains while retaining or even
improving efficacy for the tasks under consideration. In addition to using
standard physics-informed spatio-temporal models, we demonstrate the usefulness
of more recent models like flow matching as a general purpose method for
spatio-temporal forecasting. Our experiments show that incorporating physics
inductive biases offer a principled way to improve the efficiency and reduce
the carbon footprint of machine learning models. We argue that model
efficiency, along with model efficacy, should become a core consideration
driving machine learning model development and deployment.

Motivation: 现有方法存在严重遗忘问题，因为共享基础模型的完全微调会导致任务间知识干扰，且数据增强策略可能引入不自然或语义扭曲的输入。

Method: 集成专家混合架构，每个专家使用LoRA矩阵参数化；语义感知专家选择机制动态路由实例；对比学习目标利用标签描述；知识蒸馏策略防止内存缓冲区过拟合。

Result: 在多个FCED基准测试上的广泛实验表明，LEAF始终达到最先进的性能。

Conclusion: LEAF通过专家专业化、语义感知路由和对比学习有效解决了少样本持续事件检测中的挑战。

Abstract: Few-shot Continual Event Detection (FCED) poses the dual challenges of
learning from limited data and mitigating catastrophic forgetting across
sequential tasks. Existing approaches often suffer from severe forgetting due
to the full fine-tuning of a shared base model, which leads to knowledge
interference between tasks. Moreover, they frequently rely on data augmentation
strategies that can introduce unnatural or semantically distorted inputs. To
address these limitations, we propose LEAF, a novel and robust expert-based
framework for FCED. LEAF integrates a specialized mixture of experts
architecture into the base model, where each expert is parameterized with
low-rank adaptation (LoRA) matrices. A semantic-aware expert selection
mechanism dynamically routes instances to the most relevant experts, enabling
expert specialization and reducing knowledge interference. To improve
generalization in limited-data settings, LEAF incorporates a contrastive
learning objective guided by label descriptions, which capture high-level
semantic information about event types. Furthermore, to prevent overfitting on
the memory buffer, our framework employs a knowledge distillation strategy that
transfers knowledge from previous models to the current one. Extensive
experiments on multiple FCED benchmarks demonstrate that LEAF consistently
achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Video-to-audio (V2A) generation aims to synthesize realistic and semantically
aligned audio from silent videos, with potential applications in video editing,
Foley sound design, and assistive multimedia. Although the excellent results,
existing approaches either require costly joint training on large-scale paired
datasets or rely on pairwise similarities that may fail to capture global
multimodal coherence. In this work, we propose a novel training-free multimodal
guidance mechanism for V2A diffusion that leverages the volume spanned by the
modality embeddings to enforce unified alignment across video, audio, and text.
The proposed multimodal diffusion guidance (MDG) provides a lightweight,
plug-and-play control signal that can be applied on top of any pretrained audio
diffusion model without retraining. Experiments on VGGSound and AudioCaps
demonstrate that our MDG consistently improves perceptual quality and
multimodal alignment compared to baselines, proving the effectiveness of a
joint multimodal guidance for V2A.

Motivation: 现有研究表明混合架构优于单独的注意力机制或RNN层，但窗口长度的影响以及注意力机制与线性RNN层之间的相互作用尚未得到充分研究。

Method: 提出SWAX混合架构，结合滑动窗口注意力和xLSTM线性RNN层，并采用随机改变窗口大小的训练方法，强制模型同时利用较长上下文窗口和xLSTM记忆。

Result: 研究发现短窗口注意力通过减少对softmax注意力机制的依赖，能更好地训练xLSTM的长期记忆能力。随机窗口训练显著优于常规窗口注意力。

Conclusion: SWAX架构通过随机窗口训练方法，在短上下文和长上下文任务上都取得了显著提升，证明了混合架构的有效性和训练策略的重要性。

Abstract: Recent works show that hybrid architectures combining sliding window softmax
attention layers with linear recurrent neural network (RNN) layers outperform
both of these architectures taken separately. However, the impact of the window
length and the interplay between softmax attention and linear RNN layers remain
under-studied. In this work, we introduce SWAX, a hybrid architecture
consisting of sliding-window attention and xLSTM linear RNN layers.
  A counter-intuitive finding with SWAX is that larger sliding windows do not
improve the long-context performance. In fact, short window attention
encourages the model to better train the long-term memory of the xLSTM, by
relying less on the softmax attention mechanism for long context-retrieval.
  The issue with small sliding windows is that they are detrimental for
short-context tasks, which could be solved with information from moderately
larger sliding windows otherwise. Therefore, we train SWAX by stochastically
changing the sliding window size, forcing the model to leverage both a longer
context window and the xLSTM memory. SWAX trained with stochastic window sizes
significantly outperforms regular window attention both on short and
long-context problems.

Motivation: 突破以往依赖低雷诺数数值模拟的研究局限，在具有挑战性的实验环境中实现实时控制，解决执行器延迟等实际约束问题。

Method: 使用深度强化学习算法，基于圆柱体位移和速度的状态反馈，结合历史控制动作信息，学习旋转控制策略。

Result: 仅使用状态反馈时，学习到低频旋转控制策略实现80%振动抑制；增强历史控制信息后，学习到高频旋转控制策略实现超过95%振动衰减。

Conclusion: 深度强化学习在真实实验环境中具有很好的适应性，能够克服执行延迟等仪器限制，为主动流动控制提供有效解决方案。

Abstract: This study showcases an experimental deployment of deep reinforcement
learning (DRL) for active flow control (AFC) of vortex-induced vibrations (VIV)
in a circular cylinder at a high Reynolds number (Re = 3000) using rotary
actuation. Departing from prior work that relied on low-Reynolds-number
numerical simulations, this research demonstrates real-time control in a
challenging experimental setting, successfully addressing practical constraints
such as actuator delay. When the learning algorithm is provided with state
feedback alone (displacement and velocity of the oscillating cylinder), the DRL
agent learns a low-frequency rotary control strategy that achieves up to 80%
vibration suppression which leverages the traditional lock-on phenomenon. While
this level of suppression is significant, it remains below the performance
achieved using high-frequency rotary actuation. The reduction in performance is
attributed to actuation delays and can be mitigated by augmenting the learning
algorithm with past control actions. This enables the agent to learn a
high-frequency rotary control strategy that effectively modifies vortex
shedding and achieves over 95% vibration attenuation. These results demonstrate
the adaptability of DRL for AFC in real-world experiments and its ability to
overcome instrumental limitations such as actuation lag.

Conclusion: OpenVLA确实隐式学习世界模型，且提出利用稀疏自编码器(SAEs)分析其世界模型的管道。

Abstract: Vision Language Action models (VLAs) trained with policy-based reinforcement
learning (RL) encode complex behaviors without explicitly modeling
environmental dynamics. However, it remains unclear whether VLAs implicitly
learn world models, a hallmark of model-based RL. We propose an experimental
methodology using embedding arithmetic on state representations to probe
whether OpenVLA, the current state of the art in VLAs, contains latent
knowledge of state transitions. Specifically, we measure the difference between
embeddings of sequential environment states and test whether this transition
vector is recoverable from intermediate model activations. Using linear and non
linear probes trained on activations across layers, we find statistically
significant predictive ability on state transitions exceeding baselines
(embeddings), indicating that OpenVLA encodes an internal world model (as
opposed to the probes learning the state transitions). We investigate the
predictive ability of an earlier checkpoint of OpenVLA, and uncover hints that
the world model emerges as training progresses. Finally, we outline a pipeline
leveraging Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to analyze OpenVLA's world model.

Abstract: Partial differential equation (PDE)-constrained optimization arises in many
scientific and engineering domains, such as energy systems, fluid dynamics and
material design. In these problems, the decision variables (e.g., control
inputs or design parameters) are tightly coupled with the PDE state variables,
and the feasible set is implicitly defined by the governing PDE constraints.
This coupling makes the problems computationally demanding, as it requires
handling high dimensional discretization and dynamic constraints. To address
these challenges, this paper introduces a learning-based framework that
integrates a dynamic predictor with an optimization surrogate. The dynamic
predictor, a novel time-discrete Neural Operator (Lu et al.), efficiently
approximate system trajectories governed by PDE dynamics, while the
optimization surrogate leverages proxy optimizer techniques (Kotary et al.) to
approximate the associated optimal decisions. This dual-network design enables
real-time approximation of optimal strategies while explicitly capturing the
coupling between decisions and PDE dynamics. We validate the proposed approach
on benchmark PDE-constrained optimization tasks inlacing Burgers' equation,
heat equation and voltage regulation, and demonstrate that it achieves solution
quality comparable to classical control-based algorithms, such as the Direct
Method and Model Predictive Control (MPC), while providing up to four orders of
magnitude improvement in computational speed.

Motivation: 现有扩散模型在解决逆问题时，通常使用固定比例来平衡先验得分和似然得分，这种静态设计在不同时间步和任务中表现不佳，限制了性能和泛化能力。

Method: 提出SAIP插件模块，无需重新训练或修改扩散主干网络，在每个时间步自适应地优化尺度参数，可无缝集成到现有采样器中。

Result: SAIP在各种图像恢复任务中持续提升重建质量，包括具有挑战性的场景。

Conclusion: SAIP通过自适应尺度调整有效解决了现有方法的局限性，为扩散模型在逆问题中的应用提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Solving inverse problems with diffusion models has shown promise in tasks
such as image restoration. A common approach is to formulate the problem in a
Bayesian framework and sample from the posterior by combining the prior score
with the likelihood score. Since the likelihood term is often intractable,
estimators like DPS, DMPS, and $\pi$GDM are widely adopted. However, these
methods rely on a fixed, manually tuned scale to balance prior and likelihood
contributions. Such a static design is suboptimal, as the ideal balance varies
across timesteps and tasks, limiting performance and generalization. To address
this issue, we propose SAIP, a plug-and-play module that adaptively refines the
scale at each timestep without retraining or altering the diffusion backbone.
SAIP integrates seamlessly into existing samplers and consistently improves
reconstruction quality across diverse image restoration tasks, including
challenging scenarios.

TL;DR: CURA是一种受模拟音频信号处理电路启发的紧凑型AI架构，在资源受限环境中实现跨领域机器学习任务，显著减少参数需求并提升泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有设备端AI架构的两个关键限制：参数需求随任务复杂度线性增长导致缺乏紧凑性，以及特定领域模型无法适应其他应用领域的泛化能力差问题。

Method: 提出CURA架构，灵感来源于模拟音频信号处理电路，为多领域机器学习任务提供紧凑轻量级解决方案。

Result: 在紧凑性方面，使用比基线模型少2500倍的参数达到同等准确率；在泛化性方面，在四个NLP基准和一个计算机视觉数据集上表现一致，F1分数高达90%；在复杂模式识别方面，平均绝对误差降低1.6倍，均方误差降低2.1倍。

Conclusion: CURA架构在紧凑性、泛化性和复杂模式识别能力方面均优于现有方法，为资源受限环境提供了有效的跨领域AI解决方案。

Abstract: Existing on-device AI architectures for resource-constrained environments
face two critical limitations: they lack compactness, with parameter
requirements scaling proportionally to task complexity, and they exhibit poor
generalizability, performing effectively only on specific application domains
(e.g., models designed for regression tasks cannot adapt to natural language
processing (NLP) applications). In this paper, we propose CURA, an architecture
inspired by analog audio signal processing circuits that provides a compact and
lightweight solution for diverse machine learning tasks across multiple
domains. Our architecture offers three key advantages over existing approaches:
(1) Compactness: it requires significantly fewer parameters regardless of task
complexity; (2) Generalizability: it adapts seamlessly across regression,
classification, complex NLP, and computer vision tasks; and (3) Complex pattern
recognition: it can capture intricate data patterns while maintaining extremely
low model complexity. We evaluated CURA across diverse datasets and domains.
For compactness, it achieved equivalent accuracy using up to 2,500 times fewer
parameters compared to baseline models. For generalizability, it demonstrated
consistent performance across four NLP benchmarks and one computer vision
dataset, nearly matching specialized existing models (achieving F1-scores up to
90%). Lastly, it delivers superior forecasting accuracy for complex patterns,
achieving 1.6 times lower mean absolute error and 2.1 times lower mean squared
error than competing models.

TL;DR: 本文比较了决策曲线分析(DCA)和成本曲线在模型评估中的关系，发现决策曲线与Brier曲线密切相关，两者在相同阈值下会选择相同的最优模型，但Brier曲线适用范围更广且其曲线下面积即为Brier分数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分类模型通常使用决策阈值进行分类，但模型评估应考虑模型使用背景，包括正负例正确分类的相对价值。需要比较DCA和成本曲线这两种评估方法的关系、优势和局限性。

Method: 通过理论分析比较决策曲线分析(DCA)和成本曲线，特别是与Brier曲线的关系。假设模型分数已校准，并使用正负例正确分类的相对价值来设置分类阈值。

Result: 决策曲线与Brier曲线密切相关，两者x轴等价。在任何给定阈值下，净收益(DCA)和Brier损失(Brier曲线)总是选择相同的最优模型。Brier损失差异可比较，而净收益差异不可比较。Brier曲线适用范围更广，其曲线下面积即为Brier分数。

Conclusion: Brier曲线比DCA更通用，建议在DCA中使用上包络决策曲线来显示仅通过重新校准可能实现的净收益增益。

Abstract: Classification models typically predict a score and use a decision threshold
to produce a classification. Appropriate model evaluation should carefully
consider the context in which a model will be used, including the relative
value of correct classifications of positive versus negative examples, which
affects the threshold that should be used. Decision curve analysis (DCA) and
cost curves are model evaluation approaches that assess the expected utility
and expected loss of prediction models, respectively, across decision
thresholds. We compared DCA and cost curves to determine how they are related,
and their strengths and limitations. We demonstrate that decision curves are
closely related to a specific type of cost curve called a Brier curve. Both
curves are derived assuming model scores are calibrated and setting the
classification threshold using the relative value of correct positive and
negative classifications, and the x-axis of both curves are equivalent. Net
benefit (used for DCA) and Brier loss (used for Brier curves) will always
choose the same model as optimal at any given threshold. Across thresholds,
differences in Brier loss are comparable whereas differences in net benefit
cannot be compared. Brier curves are more generally applicable (when a wider
range of thresholds are plausible), and the area under the Brier curve is the
Brier score. We demonstrate that reference lines common in each space can be
included in either and suggest the upper envelope decision curve as a useful
comparison for DCA showing the possible gain in net benefit that could be
achieved through recalibration alone.

Motivation: 解决大语言模型对齐中多目标偏好之间的权衡问题，传统方法忽视了参数层面的冲突解决。

Method: 利用正交子空间分解将参数更新空间分解为正交子空间，确保不同偏好的优化在数学上不干扰的方向进行。

Conclusion: OrthAlign通过正交分解有效解决了多目标对齐中的梯度冲突，实现了稳定收敛和显著性能提升。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) alignment faces a critical dilemma when addressing
multiple human preferences: improvements in one dimension frequently come at
the expense of others, creating unavoidable trade-offs between competing
objectives like helpfulness and harmlessness. While prior work mainly focuses
on constraint-based optimization algorithms and data selection strategies to
mitigate conflicts, these approaches overlook the fundamental issue of
resolving conflicts directly at the parameter level. In this paper, we present
OrthAlign, an innovative approach that pioneers a new paradigm by leveraging
orthogonal subspace decomposition to fundamentally resolve gradient-level
conflicts in multi-objective preference alignment. OrthAlign strategically
decomposes parameter update spaces into orthogonal subspaces, ensuring that
optimization toward different preferences occurs in mathematically
non-interfering directions. Building upon this, we provide theoretical
guarantees demonstrating that when parameter increments satisfy both orthogonal
subspace constraints and spectral norm bounds, the resulting updates exhibit
linear Lipschitz growth rather than exponential instability, ensuring stable
convergence across all preference dimensions. Extensive experiments show that:
I. OrthAlign achieves maximum single-preference improvements ranging from
34.61% to 50.89% after multiple-objective alignment across helpful, harmless,
and truthful dimensions. II. With an average overall reward improvement of
13.96%.

Conclusion: RO-HNN有效地将哈密顿神经网络的范围扩展到高维物理系统。

Abstract: By embedding physical intuition, network architectures enforce fundamental
properties, such as energy conservation laws, leading to plausible predictions.
Yet, scaling these models to intrinsically high-dimensional systems remains a
significant challenge. This paper introduces Geometric Reduced-order
Hamiltonian Neural Network (RO-HNN), a novel physics-inspired neural network
that combines the conservation laws of Hamiltonian mechanics with the
scalability of model order reduction. RO-HNN is built on two core components: a
novel geometrically-constrained symplectic autoencoder that learns a
low-dimensional, structure-preserving symplectic submanifold, and a geometric
Hamiltonian neural network that models the dynamics on the submanifold. Our
experiments demonstrate that RO-HNN provides physically-consistent, stable, and
generalizable predictions of complex high-dimensional dynamics, thereby
effectively extending the scope of Hamiltonian neural networks to
high-dimensional physical systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在组合推理任务中经常失败，特别是表现出"两跳推理诅咒"现象，需要解决这种组合性差距。

Method: 引入Identity Bridge机制，在零跳身份任务上监督模型；使用简化Emb-MLP模型进行理论分析；通过小初始化或权重衰减增强正则化效果。

Result: 身份监督重塑了模型的潜在几何结构，通过隐式核范数正则化促进低秩解，使模型能够成功执行分布外两跳推理。

Conclusion: Identity Bridge机制有效解决了组合推理问题，大模型通过潜在记忆实现两跳推理，这为增强其隐式推理能力提供了重要启示。

Abstract: Despite remarkable advances, large language models often fail at
compositional reasoning tasks, a phenomenon exemplified by the ``curse of
two-hop reasoning''. This paper introduces the Identity Bridge, a simple yet
powerful mechanism that resolves this compositionality gap by supervising the
model on a zero-hop identity task. We demonstrate empirically that this
addition enables models to successfully perform out-of-distribution two-hop
reasoning, a task they otherwise completely fail. To explain this phenomenon,
we provide a theoretical analysis using a simplified Emb-MLP model, proving
that identity supervision reshapes the model's latent geometry. We show this
alignment is induced by an implicit nuclear-norm regularization during
optimization, which favors low-rank solutions that share structure across
tasks. For complex tasks, we use small initialization or weight decay to
enhance the regularization effect, which enhances the latent space alignment
effect and slows down the generalization decay. Finally, we extend our
investigation to large-scale models, observing that they still achieve two-hop
reasoning through the latent memory, which provides crucial inspiration for
enhancing their implicit reasoning abilities.

TL;DR: HyperHELM是一个在双曲空间中实现mRNA序列掩码语言模型预训练的框架，通过混合设计将双曲层置于欧几里得骨干网络之上，使学习表示与mRNA和氨基酸之间的生物层次结构对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型越来越多地应用于蛋白质和mRNA等生物序列，但其默认的欧几里得几何可能不匹配生物数据固有的层次结构。双曲几何为容纳层次数据提供了更好的替代方案，但尚未应用于mRNA序列的语言建模。

Method: 采用混合设计，在欧几里得骨干网络之上添加双曲层，在双曲空间中实现mRNA序列的掩码语言模型预训练。

Result: 在多个多物种数据集上，在10个属性预测任务中的9个任务上优于欧几里得基线，平均提升10%；在长序列和低GC含量序列的分布外泛化方面表现出色；在抗体区域注释任务中，比层次感知的欧几里得模型注释准确率提高3%。

Conclusion: 双曲几何是mRNA序列层次语言建模的有效归纳偏置。

Abstract: Language models are increasingly applied to biological sequences like
proteins and mRNA, yet their default Euclidean geometry may mismatch the
hierarchical structures inherent to biological data. While hyperbolic geometry
provides a better alternative for accommodating hierarchical data, it has yet
to find a way into language modeling for mRNA sequences. In this work, we
introduce HyperHELM, a framework that implements masked language model
pre-training in hyperbolic space for mRNA sequences. Using a hybrid design with
hyperbolic layers atop Euclidean backbone, HyperHELM aligns learned
representations with the biological hierarchy defined by the relationship
between mRNA and amino acids. Across multiple multi-species datasets, it
outperforms Euclidean baselines on 9 out of 10 tasks involving property
prediction, with 10% improvement on average, and excels in out-of-distribution
generalization to long and low-GC content sequences; for antibody region
annotation, it surpasses hierarchy-aware Euclidean models by 3% in annotation
accuracy. Our results highlight hyperbolic geometry as an effective inductive
bias for hierarchical language modeling of mRNA sequences.

Result: 实验显示T-POP实现快速且数据高效的个性化，显著优于现有基线方法，并随用户交互增加持续改进。

Conclusion: T-POP为LLM实时个性化提供了有效解决方案，无需模型更新即可实现高效个性化。

Abstract: Personalizing large language models (LLMs) to individual user preferences is
a critical step beyond generating generically helpful responses. However,
current personalization methods are ill-suited for new users, as they typically
require either slow, resource-intensive fine-tuning or a substantial amount of
pre-existing user data, creating a significant cold-start problem. To address
this challenge, we introduce a new paradigm for real-time personalization by
learning from online pairwise preference feedback collected during text
generation. We propose T-POP (Test-Time Personalization with Online Preference
Feedback}), a novel algorithm that synergistically combines test-time alignment
with dueling bandits. Without updating the LLM parameters, T-POP steers the
decoding process of a frozen LLM by learning a reward function online that
captures user preferences. By leveraging dueling bandits, T-POP intelligently
queries the user to efficiently balance between exploring their preferences and
exploiting the learned knowledge to generate personalized text. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that T-POP achieves rapid and data-efficient
personalization, significantly outperforming existing baselines and showing
consistent improvement with more user interactions.

Conclusion: 联邦老虎机框架有效解决了LLM提示优化的关键挑战，实现了样本高效、隐私保护的协作优化。

Abstract: The performance of large language models (LLMs) is highly sensitive to the
input prompt, making prompt optimization a critical task. However, real-world
application is hindered by three major challenges: (1) the black-box nature of
powerful proprietary LLMs, (2) the need for high sample efficiency due to query
costs, and (3) the desire for privacy-preserving collaboration among multiple
users. To address these challenges simultaneously, we introduce a novel
framework for sample-efficient federated prompt optimization based on
multi-armed bandits (MABs). The MAB framework is uniquely suited for this
problem as it is (1) inherently a black-box optimization method, (2)
practically sample-efficient, and (3) enables collaborative learning with
theoretically guaranteed benefit from more participating agents. We first
propose the Federated Prompt Optimization via Bandits (FedPOB) algorithm, a
federated variant of the Linear UCB algorithm, where agents collaborate by
sharing model parameters instead of raw data. We then extend our approach to
the practical setting of comparative user feedback by introducing FedPOB with
Preference Feedback (FedPOB-Pref), an efficient algorithm based on federated
dueling bandits. Extensive experiments demonstrate that both FedPOB and
FedPOB-Pref significantly outperform existing baselines and that their
performance consistently improves as more agents participate in the
collaboration, validating the effectiveness of our federated approach.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) reward models exhibit
systematic failures on longtail distributions, leading to reward hacking and
misalignment. We propose a mechanistic interpretability framework that
identifies specialized neural circuits responsible for rare-event processing in
reward models. Drawing from recent advances showing distributed specialization
for rare tokens in language models\citep{liu2025no, liu2025emergent}, we
hypothesize that reward models also develop functionally distinct circuits for
longtail scenarios. Our theoretical framework establishes formal connections
between circuit specialization, reward generalization bounds, and longtail
performance. We introduce \textbf{Circuit-Aware Reward Training (CART)}, which
uses circuit analysis to guide data augmentation, regularization, and ensemble
strategies. This approach provides both theoretical insights into reward model
failures and practical interventions for improving longtail robustness.

Abstract: Estimating queue lengths at signalized intersections remains a challenge in
traffic management, especially under partially observed conditions where
vehicle flows are not fully captured. This paper introduces Q-Net, a
data-efficient and interpretable framework for queue length estimation that
performs robustly even when traffic conservation assumptions are violated.
Q-Net integrates two widely available and privacy-friendly data sources: (i)
vehicle counts from loop detectors near stop lines, and (ii) aggregated
floating car data (aFCD), which divides each road section into segments and
provides segment-wise average speed measurements. These data sources often
differ in spatial and temporal resolution, creating fusion challenges. Q-Net
addresses this by employing a tailored state-space model and an AI-augmented
Kalman filter, KalmanNet, which learns the Kalman gain from data without
requiring prior knowledge of noise covariances or full system dynamics. We
build on the vanilla KalmanNet pipeline to decouple measurement dimensionality
from section length, enabling spatial transferability across road segments.
Unlike black-box models, Q-Net maintains physical interpretability, with
internal variables linked to real-world traffic dynamics. Evaluations on main
roads in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, demonstrate that Q-Net outperforms
baseline methods by over 60\% in Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), accurately
tracking queue formation and dissipation while correcting aFCD-induced delays.
Q-Net also demonstrates strong spatial and temporal transferability, enabling
deployment without costly sensing infrastructure like cameras or radar.
Additionally, we propose a real-time variant of Q-Net, highlighting its
potential for integration into dynamic, queue-based traffic control systems.

Motivation: 深度学习中的潜在分类变量普遍存在，但其离散特性给梯度下降学习带来挑战。现有改进梯度估计技术的方法存在局限，需要从信息几何角度重新审视softmax函数。

Method: 提出catnat函数替代softmax，该函数通过一系列层次二分法构建，能产生对角Fisher信息矩阵，从而优化梯度下降过程。

Result: 在图结构学习、变分自编码器和强化学习等实验中，catnat函数显著提高了学习效率，并获得了更高的测试性能。

Conclusion: Catnat函数易于实现，与现有代码库兼容，且与标准训练稳定技术保持兼容，是比softmax更好的替代方案。

Abstract: Latent categorical variables are frequently found in deep learning
architectures. They can model actions in discrete reinforcement-learning
environments, represent categories in latent-variable models, or express
relations in graph neural networks. Despite their widespread use, their
discrete nature poses significant challenges to gradient-descent learning
algorithms. While a substantial body of work has offered improved gradient
estimation techniques, we take a complementary approach. Specifically, we: 1)
revisit the ubiquitous $\textit{softmax}$ function and demonstrate its
limitations from an information-geometric perspective; 2) replace the
$\textit{softmax}$ with the $\textit{catnat}$ function, a function composed of
a sequence of hierarchical binary splits; we prove that this choice offers
significant advantages to gradient descent due to the resulting diagonal Fisher
Information Matrix. A rich set of experiments - including graph structure
learning, variational autoencoders, and reinforcement learning - empirically
show that the proposed function improves the learning efficiency and yields
models characterized by consistently higher test performance. $\textit{Catnat}$
is simple to implement and seamlessly integrates into existing codebases.
Moreover, it remains compatible with standard training stabilization techniques
and, as such, offers a better alternative to the $\textit{softmax}$ function.

### [707] [A TRIANGLE Enables Multimodal Alignment Beyond Cosine Similarity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24734)
*Giordano Cicchetti,Eleonora Grassucci,Danilo Comminiello*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了TRIANGLE相似性度量方法，直接在模态嵌入的高维空间中计算三角形面积相似度，用于改进三模态对齐，在对比学习中替代余弦相似度，显著提升多模态建模性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态模型存在模态对齐不充分的问题，某些模态可能未被有效对齐，导致模型在下游任务中无法充分利用多模态信息。

Method: TRIANGLE方法通过计算模态嵌入空间中三角形面积相似度来改进三模态联合对齐，无需额外的融合层或成对相似度计算。

Result: 在视频-文本和音频-文本检索、音频-视频分类等三模态任务中，TRIANGLE取得了最先进的结果，比基于余弦相似度的方法在Recall@1指标上提升高达9个百分点。

Conclusion: TRIANGLE相似性度量能显著提升多模态建模性能，同时提供可解释的对齐依据，是改进多模态对齐的有效方法。

Abstract: Multimodal learning plays a pivotal role in advancing artificial intelligence
systems by incorporating information from multiple modalities to build a more
comprehensive representation. Despite its importance, current state-of-the-art
models still suffer from severe limitations that prevent the successful
development of a fully multimodal model. Such methods may not provide
indicators that all the involved modalities are effectively aligned. As a
result, some modalities may not be aligned, undermining the effectiveness of
the model in downstream tasks where multiple modalities should provide
additional information that the model fails to exploit. In this paper, we
present TRIANGLE: TRI-modAl Neural Geometric LEarning, the novel proposed
similarity measure that is directly computed in the higher-dimensional space
spanned by the modality embeddings. TRIANGLE improves the joint alignment of
three modalities via a triangle-area similarity, avoiding additional fusion
layers or pairwise similarities. When incorporated in contrastive losses
replacing cosine similarity, TRIANGLE significantly boosts the performance of
multimodal modeling, while yielding interpretable alignment rationales.
Extensive evaluation in three-modal tasks such as video-text and audio-text
retrieval or audio-video classification, demonstrates that TRIANGLE achieves
state-of-the-art results across different datasets improving the performance of
cosine-based methods up to 9 points of Recall@1.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了RPEX方法，通过逆概率加权缓解数据污染导致的策略重尾问题，提升离线到在线强化学习的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实际环境中离线数据集和在线交互往往存在噪声甚至恶意污染，这会严重降低离线到在线强化学习的性能，而现有方法主要关注通过在线探索缓解离线策略的保守性，对数据污染下的鲁棒性研究不足。

Method: 提出RPEX方法，将逆概率加权（IPW）整合到在线探索策略中，缓解数据污染导致的策略重尾行为。

Result: 在D4RL数据集上的广泛实验表明，RPEX在各种数据污染场景下都达到了最先进的离线到在线性能。

Conclusion: RPEX是一种新颖、简单而有效的方法，能够显著提升离线到在线强化学习在数据污染环境下的鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: Pretraining a policy on offline data followed by fine-tuning through online
interactions, known as Offline-to-Online Reinforcement Learning (O2O RL), has
emerged as a promising paradigm for real-world RL deployment. However, both
offline datasets and online interactions in practical environments are often
noisy or even maliciously corrupted, severely degrading the performance of O2O
RL. Existing works primarily focus on mitigating the conservatism of offline
policies via online exploration, while the robustness of O2O RL under data
corruption, including states, actions, rewards, and dynamics, is still
unexplored. In this work, we observe that data corruption induces heavy-tailed
behavior in the policy, thereby substantially degrading the efficiency of
online exploration. To address this issue, we incorporate Inverse Probability
Weighted (IPW) into the online exploration policy to alleviate
heavy-tailedness, and propose a novel, simple yet effective method termed
$\textbf{RPEX}$: $\textbf{R}$obust $\textbf{P}$olicy $\textbf{EX}$pansion.
Extensive experimental results on D4RL datasets demonstrate that RPEX achieves
SOTA O2O performance across a wide range of data corruption scenarios. Code is

*David Berghaus,Patrick Seifner,Kostadin Cvejoski,César Ojeda,Ramsés J. Sánchez*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于标记时间点过程(MTPP)的基础推理模型FIM-PP，通过摊销推理和上下文学习，在大量合成数据上预训练后，能够无需额外训练或快速微调即可应用于真实世界数据的事件序列建模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前神经网络方法需要为每个目标系统训练专门的MTPP模型，缺乏通用性。本文追求一种根本不同的方法，利用摊销推理和上下文学习来构建通用的基础推理模型。

Method: 基于摊销推理和上下文学习，在广泛的Hawkes过程分布生成的大规模合成数据集上预训练深度神经网络，使其能够从事件序列上下文推断条件强度函数。

Result: 实验表明，这种摊销方法在常见基准数据集上的下一事件预测任务中，能够达到与专门模型相当的性能。

Conclusion: FIM-PP模型展示了构建通用MTPP推理模型的可行性，能够无需额外训练或通过快速微调应用于真实世界数据，为事件序列建模提供了新的范式。

Abstract: Modeling event sequences of multiple event types with marked temporal point
processes (MTPPs) provides a principled way to uncover governing dynamical
rules and predict future events. Current neural network approaches to MTPP
inference rely on training separate, specialized models for each target system.
We pursue a radically different approach: drawing on amortized inference and
in-context learning, we pretrain a deep neural network to infer, in-context,
the conditional intensity functions of event histories from a context defined
by sets of event sequences. Pretraining is performed on a large synthetic
dataset of MTPPs sampled from a broad distribution of Hawkes processes. Once
pretrained, our Foundation Inference Model for Point Processes (FIM-PP) can
estimate MTPPs from real-world data without any additional training, or be
rapidly finetuned to target systems. Experiments show that this amortized
approach matches the performance of specialized models on next-event prediction
across common benchmark datasets.
  Our pretrained model, repository and tutorials will soon be available online

*Fabrizio Frasca,Guy Bar-Shalom,Yftah Ziser,Haggai Maron*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出CHARM方法，将幻觉检测建模为图学习任务，通过图神经网络处理基于注意力流和激活值的属性图，统一多种计算轨迹信号，在多个基准测试中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型经常产生错误或未经支持的内容（幻觉），现有检测方法依赖启发式方法或孤立计算轨迹的简单模型，需要统一这些信号来改进检测效果。

Method: 将令牌表示为节点，注意力流作为边，注意力分数和激活值作为特征的属性图，使用图神经网络进行幻觉检测学习。

Result: CHARM在理论上包含先前的基于注意力的启发式方法，在实验中始终优于其他领先方法，在跨数据集迁移中展现出有前景的零样本性能。

Conclusion: 图结构在幻觉检测中发挥重要作用，结合计算轨迹具有明显优势，CHARM方法为幻觉检测提供了有效的统一框架。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate incorrect or unsupported content,
known as hallucinations. Existing detection methods rely on heuristics or
simple models over isolated computational traces such as activations, or
attention maps. We unify these signals by representing them as attributed
graphs, where tokens are nodes, edges follow attentional flows, and both carry
features from attention scores and activations. Our approach, CHARM, casts
hallucination detection as a graph learning task and tackles it by applying
GNNs over the above attributed graphs. We show that CHARM provably subsumes
prior attention-based heuristics and, experimentally, it consistently
outperforms other leading approaches across diverse benchmarks. Our results
shed light on the relevant role played by the graph structure and on the
benefits of combining computational traces, whilst showing CHARM exhibits
promising zero-shot performance on cross-dataset transfer.

*Kacper Kapuśniak,Cristian Gabellini,Michael Bronstein,Prudencio Tossou,Francesco Di Giovanni*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为MSM Emulators的新生成模型类别，通过马尔可夫状态模型学习离散状态间的转换，实现了比传统分子动力学模拟快两个数量级的采样速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统分子动力学模拟计算成本高昂，现有生成模型学习固定滞后转换密度，训练信号被频繁但无信息的转换主导。

Method: 提出了MarS-FM（马尔可夫空间流匹配）方法，基于马尔可夫状态模型学习离散状态间的转换采样。

Result: MarS-FM在结构观测指标（RMSD、回转半径、二级结构含量）上均优于现有方法，实现了两个数量级的加速。

Conclusion: MSM Emulators类模型在蛋白质动力学模拟中表现出色，MarS-FM方法在泛化能力和性能方面显著优于现有技术。

Abstract: Molecular Dynamics (MD) is a powerful computational microscope for probing
protein functions. However, the need for fine-grained integration and the long
timescales of biomolecular events make MD computationally expensive. To address
this, several generative models have been proposed to generate surrogate
trajectories at lower cost. Yet, these models typically learn a fixed-lag
transition density, causing the training signal to be dominated by frequent but
uninformative transitions. We introduce a new class of generative models, MSM
Emulators, which instead learn to sample transitions across discrete states
defined by an underlying Markov State Model (MSM). We instantiate this class
with Markov Space Flow Matching (MarS-FM), whose sampling offers more than two
orders of magnitude speedup compared to implicit- or explicit-solvent MD
simulations. We benchmark Mars-FM ability to reproduce MD statistics through
structural observables such as RMSD, radius of gyration, and secondary
structure content. Our evaluation spans protein domains (up to 500 residues)
with significant chemical and structural diversity, including unfolding events,
and enforces strict sequence dissimilarity between training and test sets to
assess generalization. Across all metrics, MarS-FM outperforms existing
methods, often by a substantial margin.

TL;DR: Labyrinth是一个专为测试模仿学习泛化能力设计的基准环境，通过精确控制结构、起点/目标位置和任务复杂度，提供可验证的不同训练、评估和测试设置。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模仿学习基准在训练和评估之间缺乏足够的变化，限制了有意义的泛化能力评估。

Method: 设计Labyrinth环境，提供离散、完全可观察的状态空间和已知最优动作，支持可解释性和细粒度评估。环境设置灵活，可针对泛化因素进行测试，包括部分可观测性、钥匙门任务和冰面危险等变体。

Result: Labyrinth能够实现受控、可重复的实验，支持对模仿学习泛化能力的评估。

Conclusion: Labyrinth推进了模仿学习中泛化能力的评估，为开发更鲁棒的智能体提供了有价值的工具。

Abstract: Imitation learning benchmarks often lack sufficient variation between
training and evaluation, limiting meaningful generalisation assessment. We
introduce Labyrinth, a benchmarking environment designed to test generalisation
with precise control over structure, start and goal positions, and task
complexity. It enables verifiably distinct training, evaluation, and test
settings. Labyrinth provides a discrete, fully observable state space and known
optimal actions, supporting interpretability and fine-grained evaluation. Its
flexible setup allows targeted testing of generalisation factors and includes
variants like partial observability, key-and-door tasks, and ice-floor hazards.
By enabling controlled, reproducible experiments, Labyrinth advances the
evaluation of generalisation in imitation learning and provides a valuable tool
for developing more robust agents.

*Felix Strnad,Jonathan Schmidt,Fabian Mockert,Philipp Hennig,Nicole Ludwig*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究分析了德国未来Dunkelflaute事件（低风能和太阳能发电期）的影响，发现其频率和持续时间在气候情景下基本保持不变。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 欧洲电网向可再生能源转型，但风能和太阳能的天气依赖性对电网稳定性构成挑战，特别是Dunkelflaute事件可能导致电力供应短缺。

Method: 采用生成式深度学习框架对CMIP6气候模拟进行降尺度处理，并与ERA5历史数据进行比较，评估SSP2-4.5和SSP5-8.5排放情景下的Dunkelflaute事件。

Result: 分析表明，德国Dunkelflaute事件的频率和持续时间在集合平均值中与历史时期相比基本保持不变。

Conclusion: 在所考虑的气候情景下，Dunkelflaute事件相关风险预计在本世纪内保持稳定。

Abstract: The European electricity power grid is transitioning towards renewable energy
sources, characterized by an increasing share of off- and onshore wind and
solar power. However, the weather dependency of these energy sources poses a
challenge to grid stability, with so-called Dunkelflaute events -- periods of
low wind and solar power generation -- being of particular concern due to their
potential to cause electricity supply shortages. In this study, we investigate
the impact of these events on the German electricity production in the years
and decades to come. For this purpose, we adapt a recently developed generative
deep learning framework to downscale climate simulations from the CMIP6
ensemble. We first compare their statistics to the historical record taken from
ERA5 data. Next, we use these downscaled simulations to assess plausible future
occurrences of Dunkelflaute events in Germany under the optimistic low
(SSP2-4.5) and high (SSP5-8.5) emission scenarios. Our analysis indicates that
both the frequency and duration of Dunkelflaute events in Germany in the
ensemble mean are projected to remain largely unchanged compared to the
historical period. This suggests that, under the considered climate scenarios,
the associated risk is expected to remain stable throughout the century.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了Fidel-TS基准测试，通过从实时API获取数据构建大规模基准，解决了时间序列预测模型评估中缺乏高质量基准的问题，揭示了现有基准的偏见和设计局限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时间序列预测模型评估缺乏高质量基准，现有数据集存在预训练数据污染、因果和描述泄露等问题，导致进展的假象。

Method: 形式化高保真基准测试的核心原则（数据源完整性、严格因果合理性、结构清晰性），通过从实时API获取数据构建Fidel-TS基准。

Result: 实验验证了该方法，暴露了先前基准的关键偏见和设计局限，并证明文本信息的因果相关性是多模态预测实现真正性能提升的关键因素。

Conclusion: 构建基于严格原则的高质量基准对于准确评估时间序列预测模型至关重要，文本信息的因果相关性是多模态预测成功的关键。

Abstract: The evaluation of time series forecasting models is hindered by a critical
lack of high-quality benchmarks, leading to a potential illusion of progress.
Existing datasets suffer from issues ranging from pre-training data
contamination in the age of LLMs to the causal and description leakage
prevalent in early multimodal designs. To address this, we formalize the core
principles of high-fidelity benchmarking, focusing on data sourcing integrity,
strict causal soundness, and structural clarity. We introduce Fidel-TS, a new
large-scale benchmark built from the ground up on these principles by sourcing
data from live APIs. Our extensive experiments validate this approach by
exposing the critical biases and design limitations of prior benchmarks.
Furthermore, we conclusively demonstrate that the causal relevance of textual
information is the key factor in unlocking genuine performance gains in
multimodal forecasting.

*Zixu Wang,Hongbin Dong,Xiaoping Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了DSAT-HD模型，通过混合分解机制、多尺度自适应路径和双流残差学习框架，解决了传统时间序列预测方法在捕捉多尺度特征和处理复杂季节性方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于Transformer的时间序列预测方法主要建模有限时间序列或固定尺度，难以捕捉跨不同范围的多样化特征。传统分解方法如STL需要预定义季节周期且通常只能处理单一固定季节性。

Method: 1) 混合分解机制：结合EMA和傅里叶分解与RevIN归一化，通过噪声Top-k门控动态平衡季节和趋势分量；2) 多尺度自适应路径：使用稀疏分配器将特征路由到四个并行Transformer层，通过稀疏组合器合并特征，结合局部CNN和全局交互的混合注意力；3) 双流残差学习框架：CNN和MLP分支分别处理季节和趋势分量，通过最小化专家协作方差的平衡损失函数协调。

Result: 在九个数据集上的广泛实验表明，DSAT-HD整体优于现有方法，并在某些数据集上达到最先进性能。在多种迁移场景下表现出更强的泛化能力。

Conclusion: DSAT-HD通过创新的混合分解、多尺度自适应和双流学习框架，有效解决了时间序列预测中的多尺度特征捕捉和复杂季节性处理问题，具有优异的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Time series forecasting is crucial for various applications, such as weather,
traffic, electricity, and energy predictions. Currently, common time series
forecasting methods are based on Transformers. However, existing approaches
primarily model limited time series or fixed scales, making it more challenging
to capture diverse features cross different ranges. Additionally, traditional
methods like STL for complex seasonality-trend decomposition require
pre-specified seasonal periods and typically handle only single, fixed
seasonality. We propose the Hybrid Decomposition Dual-Stream Adaptive
Transformer (DSAT-HD), which integrates three key innovations to address the
limitations of existing methods: 1) A hybrid decomposition mechanism combining
EMA and Fourier decomposition with RevIN normalization, dynamically balancing
seasonal and trend components through noise Top-k gating; 2) A multi-scale
adaptive pathway leveraging a sparse allocator to route features to four
parallel Transformer layers, followed by feature merging via a sparse combiner,
enhanced by hybrid attention combining local CNNs and global interactions; 3) A
dual-stream residual learning framework where CNN and MLP branches separately
process seasonal and trend components, coordinated by a balanced loss function
minimizing expert collaboration variance. Extensive experiments on nine
datasets demonstrate that DSAT-HD outperforms existing methods overall and
achieves state-of-the-art performance on some datasets. Notably, it also
exhibits stronger generalization capabilities across various transfer
scenarios.

Conclusion: 物理先验信息的正确对齐可以显著提升学习性能，消除数据依赖性的负面影响

Abstract: A major challenge in physics-informed machine learning is to understand how
the incorporation of prior domain knowledge affects learning rates when data
are dependent. Focusing on empirical risk minimization with physics-informed
regularization, we derive complexity-dependent bounds on the excess risk in
probability and in expectation. We prove that, when the physical prior
information is aligned, the learning rate improves from the (slow) Sobolev
minimax rate to the (fast) optimal i.i.d. one without any sample-size deflation
due to data dependence.

Conclusion: DyMoDreamer通过改进动态特征提取显著提升了基于模型强化学习的样本效率和性能，在多个基准测试中达到最先进水平。

Abstract: A critical bottleneck in deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is sample
inefficiency, as training high-performance agents often demands extensive
environmental interactions. Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) mitigates
this by building world models that simulate environmental dynamics and generate
synthetic experience, improving sample efficiency. However, conventional world
models process observations holistically, failing to decouple dynamic objects
and temporal features from static backgrounds. This approach is computationally
inefficient, especially for visual tasks where dynamic objects significantly
influence rewards and decision-making performance. To address this, we
introduce DyMoDreamer, a novel MBRL algorithm that incorporates a dynamic
modulation mechanism to improve the extraction of dynamic features and enrich
the temporal information. DyMoDreamer employs differential observations derived
from a novel inter-frame differencing mask, explicitly encoding object-level
motion cues and temporal dynamics. Dynamic modulation is modeled as stochastic
categorical distributions and integrated into a recurrent state-space model
(RSSM), enhancing the model's focus on reward-relevant dynamics. Experiments
demonstrate that DyMoDreamer sets a new state-of-the-art on the Atari $100$k
benchmark with a $156.6$\% mean human-normalized score, establishes a new
record of $832$ on the DeepMind Visual Control Suite, and gains a $9.5$\%
performance improvement after $1$M steps on the Crafter benchmark. Our code is
released at https://github.com/Ultraman-Tiga1/DyMoDreamer.

Abstract: Single-cell RNA sequencing has transformed biology by enabling the
measurement of gene expression at cellular resolution, providing information
for cell types, states, and disease contexts. Recently, single-cell foundation
models have emerged as powerful tools for learning transferable representations
directly from expression profiles, improving performance on classification and
clustering tasks. However, these models are limited to discrete prediction
heads, which collapse cellular complexity into predefined labels that fail to
capture the richer, contextual explanations biologists need. We introduce
Cell2Text, a multimodal generative framework that translates scRNA-seq profiles
into structured natural language descriptions. By integrating gene-level
embeddings from single-cell foundation models with pretrained large language
models, Cell2Text generates coherent summaries that capture cellular identity,
tissue origin, disease associations, and pathway activity, generalizing to
unseen cells. Empirically, Cell2Text outperforms baselines on classification
accuracy, demonstrates strong ontological consistency using PageRank-based
similarity metrics, and achieves high semantic fidelity in text generation.
These results demonstrate that coupling expression data with natural language
offers both stronger predictive performance and inherently interpretable
outputs, pointing to a scalable path for label-efficient characterization of
unseen cells.

Result: 逻辑回归准确率90.0%，随机森林90.4%，XGBoost 90.3%。流行度是最重要的预测因子，乐器度、情感效价、时长和语音度也有显著贡献。

Conclusion: 流行度是预测歌曲进入Billboard Hot 100排行榜的最强指标，机器学习模型能够以超过90%的准确率预测歌曲上榜情况，为音乐产业成功因素分析提供了有效工具。

Abstract: The advent of digital streaming platforms have recently revolutionized the
landscape of music industry, with the ensuing digitalization providing
structured data collections that open new research avenues for investigating
popularity dynamics and mainstream success. The present work explored which
determinants hold the strongest predictive influence for a track's inclusion in
the Billboard Hot 100 charts, including streaming popularity, measurable audio
signal attributes, and probabilistic indicators of human listening. The
analysis revealed that popularity was by far the most decisive predictor of
Billboard Hot 100 inclusion, with considerable contribution from
instrumentalness, valence, duration and speechiness. Logistic Regression
achieved 90.0% accuracy, with very high recall for charting singles (0.986) but
lower recall for non-charting ones (0.813), yielding balanced F1-scores around
0.90. Random Forest slightly improved performance to 90.4% accuracy,
maintaining near-perfect precision for non-charting singles (0.990) and high
recall for charting ones (0.992), with F1-scores up to 0.91. Gradient Boosting
(XGBoost) reached 90.3% accuracy, delivering a more balanced trade-off by
improving recall for non-charting singles (0.837) while sustaining high recall
for charting ones (0.969), resulting in F1-scores comparable to the other
models.

*Jiayi Li,Flora D. Salim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DRIFT-Net提出了一种双分支神经网络架构，通过谱分支和图像分支的协同工作来改进PDE动力学学习，解决了现有注意力模型全局耦合不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的PDE基础模型主要采用多尺度窗口自注意力机制，但由于其局部性，真正的全局谱耦合只能通过深度堆叠和窗口移动逐步传播，这削弱了全局耦合，导致闭环推演中的误差累积和漂移。

Method: 采用双分支设计：谱分支负责捕捉全局大尺度低频信息，图像分支专注于局部细节和非平稳结构。通过受控的轻量级低频混合和带权融合策略，避免宽度膨胀和训练不稳定。

Conclusion: DRIFT-Net通过双分支架构有效结合了全局谱信息和局部细节，在保持高吞吐量的同时显著降低了误差和参数数量，为PDE动力学学习提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Learning PDE dynamics with neural solvers can significantly improve
wall-clock efficiency and accuracy compared with classical numerical solvers.
In recent years, foundation models for PDEs have largely adopted multi-scale
windowed self-attention, with the scOT backbone in \textsc{Poseidon} serving as
a representative example.
  However, because of their locality, truly globally consistent spectral
coupling can only be propagated gradually through deep stacking and window
shifting. This weakens global coupling and leads to error accumulation and
drift during closed-loop rollouts. To address this, we propose
\textbf{DRIFT-Net}. It employs a dual-branch design comprising a spectral
branch and an image branch. The spectral branch is responsible for capturing
global, large-scale low-frequency information, whereas the image branch focuses
on local details and nonstationary structures. Specifically, we first perform
controlled, lightweight mixing within the low-frequency range. Then we fuse the
spectral and image paths at each layer via bandwise weighting, which avoids the
width inflation and training instability caused by naive concatenation. The
fused result is transformed back into the spatial domain and added to the image
branch, thereby preserving both global structure and high-frequency details
across scales. Compared with strong attention-based baselines, DRIFT-Net
achieves lower error and higher throughput with fewer parameters under
identical training settings and budget. On Navier--Stokes benchmarks, the
relative $L_{1}$ error is reduced by 7\%--54\%, the parameter count decreases
by about 15\%, and the throughput remains higher than scOT. Ablation studies
and theoretical analyses further demonstrate the stability and effectiveness of
this design. The code is available at

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification is essential in human-machine collaboration, as
human agents tend to adjust their decisions based on the confidence of the
machine counterpart. Reliably calibrated model uncertainties, hence, enable
more effective collaboration, targeted expert intervention and more responsible
usage of Machine Learning (ML) systems. Conformal prediction has become a well
established model-agnostic framework for uncertainty calibration of ML models,
offering statistically valid confidence estimates for both regression and
classification tasks. In this work, we apply conformal prediction to
$\textit{SoilNet}$, a multimodal multitask model for describing soil profiles.
We design a simulated human-in-the-loop (HIL) annotation pipeline, where a
limited budget for obtaining ground truth annotations from domain experts is
available when model uncertainty is high. Our experiments show that
conformalizing SoilNet leads to more efficient annotation in regression tasks
and comparable performance scores in classification tasks under the same
annotation budget when tested against its non-conformal counterpart. All code

Abstract: Neural scaling laws underlie many of the recent advances in deep learning,
yet their theoretical understanding remains largely confined to linear models.
In this work, we present a systematic analysis of scaling laws for quadratic
and diagonal neural networks in the feature learning regime. Leveraging
connections with matrix compressed sensing and LASSO, we derive a detailed
phase diagram for the scaling exponents of the excess risk as a function of
sample complexity and weight decay. This analysis uncovers crossovers between
distinct scaling regimes and plateau behaviors, mirroring phenomena widely
reported in the empirical neural scaling literature. Furthermore, we establish
a precise link between these regimes and the spectral properties of the trained
network weights, which we characterize in detail. As a consequence, we provide
a theoretical validation of recent empirical observations connecting the
emergence of power-law tails in the weight spectrum with network generalization
performance, yielding an interpretation from first principles.

Abstract: Canonicalization is a widely used strategy in equivariant machine learning,
enforcing symmetry in neural networks by mapping each input to a standard form.
Yet, it often introduces discontinuities that can affect stability during
training, limit generalization, and complicate universal approximation
theorems. In this paper, we address this by introducing \emph{adaptive
canonicalization}, a general framework in which the canonicalization depends
both on the input and the network. Specifically, we present the adaptive
canonicalization based on prior maximization, where the standard form of the
input is chosen to maximize the predictive confidence of the network. We prove
that this construction yields continuous and symmetry-respecting models that
admit universal approximation properties.
  We propose two applications of our setting: (i) resolving eigenbasis
ambiguities in spectral graph neural networks, and (ii) handling rotational
symmetries in point clouds. We empirically validate our methods on molecular
and protein classification, as well as point cloud classification tasks. Our
adaptive canonicalization outperforms the three other common solutions to
equivariant machine learning: data augmentation, standard canonicalization, and
equivariant architectures.

TL;DR: 该研究通过SRV表示和图过滤方法分析蛋白质语言模型的隐藏表示空间，发现PLMs主要编码残基的局部关系，最结构忠实的编码出现在模型接近但未达到最后一层的位置。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解蛋白质语言模型如何将序列空间转换为隐藏表示空间，以及这些表示中编码的信息，目前尚未完全清楚。现有研究主要关注单个序列的转换，而缺乏对整个序列空间及其关系的理解。

Method: 使用平方根速度(SRV)表示和图过滤方法，在SCOP数据集上分析不同蛋白质类型，研究ESM2模型中SRV形状空间的Karcher均值和有效维度随层数的变化模式。

Result: PLMs优先编码残基间的即时和局部关系，但在较大上下文长度时性能下降。最结构忠实的编码出现在模型接近但未达到最后一层的位置，表明在这些层上训练折叠模型可能提高折叠性能。

Conclusion: 蛋白质语言模型在隐藏表示中主要编码局部结构关系，最有效的结构信息编码位于模型中间层，这为改进蛋白质折叠模型提供了重要见解。

Abstract: While protein language models (PLMs) are one of the most promising avenues of
research for future de novo protein design, the way in which they transform
sequences to hidden representations, as well as the information encoded in such
representations is yet to be fully understood. Several works have attempted to
propose interpretability tools for PLMs, but they have focused on understanding
how individual sequences are transformed by such models. Therefore, the way in
which PLMs transform the whole space of sequences along with their relations is
still unknown. In this work we attempt to understand this transformed space of
sequences by identifying protein structure and representation with square-root
velocity (SRV) representations and graph filtrations. Both approaches naturally
lead to a metric space in which pairs of proteins or protein representations
can be compared with each other.
  We analyze different types of proteins from the SCOP dataset and show that
the Karcher mean and effective dimension of the SRV shape space follow a
non-linear pattern as a function of the layers in ESM2 models of different
sizes. Furthermore, we use graph filtrations as a tool to study the context
lengths at which models encode the structural features of proteins. We find
that PLMs preferentially encode immediate as well as local relations between
residues, but start to degrade for larger context lengths. The most
structurally faithful encoding tends to occur close to, but before the last
layer of the models, indicating that training a folding model ontop of these
layers might lead to improved folding performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在顺序决策中探索能力不足，需要研究如何通过SFT和RL训练来提升其探索策略和泛化能力。

Method: 使用SFT基于专家轨迹训练，以及RL配合多种奖励信号（包括策略性后悔奖励和算法模仿奖励）来训练LLMs。

Result: 训练后的智能体超越预训练模型，性能接近UCB和Thompson Sampling算法，在6倍更长时域和不同老虎机家族中具有鲁棒泛化能力。

Conclusion: RL/SFT训练使模型更贪婪但容易过早失败，模仿UCB的智能体通过学习更利用性变体超越了教师模型，建议需要定制化奖励设计和超越平均后悔的评估来促进稳健探索行为。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) hold promise to become autonomous agents,
they often explore suboptimally in sequential decision-making. Recent work has
sought to enhance this capability via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or
reinforcement learning (RL), improving regret on the classic multi-armed bandit
task. However, it remains unclear how these learning methods shape exploration
strategies and how well they generalize. We investigate both paradigms by
training LLMs with SFT on expert trajectories and RL with a range of tailored
reward signals including a strategic, regret-shaped reward to reduce variance,
and an algorithmic reward that enables oracle imitation. The resulting agents
outperform pre-trained models and achieve performance comparable to Upper
Confidence Bound (UCB) and Thompson Sampling, with robust generalization to 6x
longer horizons and across bandit families. Behavioral analysis reveals that
gains often stem from more sophisticated but greedier exploitation: RL/SFT
agents are more prone to early catastrophic failure than pre-trained models,
prematurely abandoning exploration. Furthermore, agents trained to imitate UCB
learn to outperform their teacher by adopting more exploitative variants. Our
findings clarify when each training paradigm is preferable and advocate
tailored reward design and evaluation beyond average regret to promote robust
exploratory behavior.

TL;DR: 本研究探索了在抗体贝叶斯优化中融入结构信息的方法，发现某些结构信息在早期优化阶段能提高稳定性优化的数据效率，但峰值性能相当。加入蛋白质语言模型软约束后，序列方法能达到与结构方法相当的性能。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 抗体治疗特性的工程化通常是迭代且昂贵的，贝叶斯优化是自然选择，但为高度结构化的抗体空间选择最优代理模型很困难，且可能因优化特性而异。此前没有研究尝试将结构信息融入抗体贝叶斯优化。

Method: 探索了将结构信息融入贝叶斯优化的不同方法，并与多种仅序列方法进行比较，测试了结合亲和力和稳定性两个抗体特性。提出了基于蛋白质语言模型的"软约束"来引导优化到有前景的空间区域。

Result: 某些类型的结构信息在早期优化轮次中提高了稳定性的数据效率，但峰值性能相当。加入蛋白质语言模型软约束后，亲和力的数据效率差距减小，稳定性的差距消除，序列方法能匹配结构方法的性能。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，在抗体贝叶斯优化中，结构信息可能不是必需的，因为加入蛋白质语言模型软约束后，仅序列方法就能达到与结构方法相当的性能。

Abstract: Bayesian optimization is a natural candidate for the engineering of antibody
therapeutic properties, which is often iterative and expensive. However,
finding the optimal choice of surrogate model for optimization over the highly
structured antibody space is difficult, and may differ depending on the
property being optimized. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, no prior
works have attempted to incorporate structural information into antibody
Bayesian optimization. In this work, we explore different approaches to
incorporating structural information into Bayesian optimization, and compare
them to a variety of sequence-only approaches on two different antibody
properties, binding affinity and stability. In addition, we propose the use of
a protein language model-based ``soft constraint,'' which helps guide the
optimization to promising regions of the space. We find that certain types of
structural information improve data efficiency in early optimization rounds for
stability, but have equivalent peak performance. Moreover, when incorporating
the protein language model soft constraint we find that the data efficiency gap
is diminished for affinity and eliminated for stability, resulting in
sequence-only methods that match the performance of structure-based methods,
raising questions about the necessity of structure in Bayesian optimization for
antibodies.

TL;DR: 该论文将流匹配(Flow Matching)与最优加速传输(Optimal Acceleration Transport)理论结合，提出了OAT-FM方法，通过优化加速度传输而非恒定速度来改善流直线性，并设计了一个两阶段的FM范式来提升现有生成模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于最优传输(OT)的流匹配方法隐含的直线化目标与最小化OAT定义的物理加速度作用在数学上等价，这启发了通过优化加速度传输来改进流匹配方法。

Method: 提出了OAT-FM方法，在样本和速度的乘积空间中优化加速度传输，其目标对应流直线性的充要条件。设计了低复杂度算法实现OAT-FM，并提出两阶段FM范式：先用任意FM方法训练生成模型，再用OAT-FM进行微调。

Result: OAT-FM消除了数据分布漂移的风险，无需生成大量噪声数据对，在各种生成任务中一致地提升了模型性能。

Conclusion: OAT-FM通过将流匹配与最优加速传输理论结合，提供了一个理论严谨且实践有效的改进方法，特别适合作为现有生成模型的微调阶段。

Abstract: As a powerful technique in generative modeling, Flow Matching (FM) aims to
learn velocity fields from noise to data, which is often explained and
implemented as solving Optimal Transport (OT) problems. In this study, we
bridge FM and the recent theory of Optimal Acceleration Transport (OAT),
developing an improved FM method called OAT-FM and exploring its benefits in
both theory and practice. In particular, we demonstrate that the straightening
objective hidden in existing OT-based FM methods is mathematically equivalent
to minimizing the physical action associated with acceleration defined by OAT.
Accordingly, instead of enforcing constant velocity, OAT-FM optimizes the
acceleration transport in the product space of sample and velocity, whose
objective corresponds to a necessary and sufficient condition of flow
straightness. An efficient algorithm is designed to achieve OAT-FM with low
complexity. OAT-FM motivates a new two-phase FM paradigm: Given a generative
model trained by an arbitrary FM method, whose velocity information has been
relatively reliable, we can fine-tune and improve it via OAT-FM. This paradigm
eliminates the risk of data distribution drift and the need to generate a large
number of noise data pairs, which consistently improves model performance in
various generative tasks. Code is available at:

Motivation: 深度强化学习训练存在超参数调优困难和计算成本高的问题。迁移学习可以重用已有知识来避免从头训练，但标准深度RL模型学习到的表示可能高度相关，限制了在线性函数逼近中的有效性。

Method: 提出一种带有正则化项的深度Q学习方法，旨在减少状态特征表示之间的正相关性，从而获得相关性更低、更适合线性函数逼近的特征表示。

Result: 在标准RL基准和MinAtar游戏上的实验表明，该方法能有效提升迁移学习性能并减少计算开销。

Conclusion: 通过减少特征表示的相关性，可以显著改善线性函数逼近在迁移学习中的效果，为解决深度RL训练挑战提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated success in solving complex
sequential decision-making problems by integrating neural networks with the RL
framework. However, training deep RL models poses several challenges, such as
the need for extensive hyperparameter tuning and high computational costs.
Transfer learning has emerged as a promising strategy to address these
challenges by enabling the reuse of knowledge from previously learned tasks for
new, related tasks. This avoids the need for retraining models entirely from
scratch. A commonly used approach for transfer learning in RL is to leverage
the internal representations learned by the neural network during training.
Specifically, the activations from the last hidden layer can be viewed as
refined state representations that encapsulate the essential features of the
input. In this work, we investigate whether these representations can be used
as input for training simpler models, such as linear function approximators, on
new tasks. We observe that the representations learned by standard deep RL
models can be highly correlated, which limits their effectiveness when used
with linear function approximation. To mitigate this problem, we propose a
novel deep Q-learning approach that introduces a regularization term to reduce
positive correlations between feature representation of states. By leveraging
these reduced correlated features, we enable more effective use of linear
function approximation in transfer learning. Through experiments and ablation
studies on standard RL benchmarks and MinAtar games, we demonstrate the
efficacy of our approach in improving transfer learning performance and thereby
reducing computational overhead.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的推理时算法（如思维链和多分支推理）显著增加了token使用和延迟，而之前的工作主要关注减少token使用但往往牺牲准确性

Method: 使用轻量级线性探测模型基于LLM层激活预测分支正确性，通过编排策略决定分支的终止、复制或继续，并在多请求场景下优先处理简单推理任务

Result: 在三个推理基准测试中，DUCHESS将token使用减少42-63%，在vLLM服务中平均延迟减少57-81%，中位数延迟减少58-85%，尾部延迟减少52-84%

Conclusion: DUCHESS能够在不牺牲准确性的前提下显著降低LLM推理的延迟和成本

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly rely on inference-time reasoning
algorithms such as chain-of-thought and multi-branch reasoning to improve
accuracy on complex tasks. These methods, however, substantially increase token
usage and per-request latency. Prior work has largely focused on reducing token
usage, often at the expense of accuracy, while overlooking other latency
factors. We present DUCHESS, an LLM serving system that reduces cost and
latency without sacrificing accuracy through intra-request branch orchestration
guided by predictions. DUCHESS employs a lightweight linear probing model over
LLM layer activations to estimate branch correctness, and its orchestration
policy decides whether to terminate, duplicate, or continue a branch. When
handling multiple requests, DUCHESS further reduces latency by prioritizing
easier reasoning tasks when complexity can be estimated from the prompt.
Experiments on three reasoning benchmarks show that DUCHESS consistently
improves the token-accuracy Pareto frontier, reducing token usage by 42-63% at
matched accuracy compared to self-consistency. In serving with vLLM, DUCHESS
reduces mean, median, and tail latencies by 57-81%, 58-85%, and 52-84% with
First-Come-First-Served scheduling, and achieves additional gains under
difficulty-aware scheduling at higher request rates.

Motivation: 现有的CATE估计方法在低重叠区域表现不佳，需要一种能够专门处理低重叠问题的改进方法。

Method: 引入重叠自适应正则化（OAR），将正则化强度与重叠权重成比例，在低重叠区域施加更强的正则化。该方法适用于参数和非参数二阶模型，并提出了保持Neyman正交性的去偏版本。

Result: 通过一系列（半）合成实验证明，与恒定正则化相比，OAR在低重叠设置下显著改善了CATE估计性能。

Conclusion: OAR是首个在元学习器正则化项中利用重叠权重的方法，能有效提升低重叠区域的CATE估计效果，且具有灵活性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: The conditional average treatment effect (CATE) is widely used in
personalized medicine to inform therapeutic decisions. However,
state-of-the-art methods for CATE estimation (so-called meta-learners) often
perform poorly in the presence of low overlap. In this work, we introduce a new
approach to tackle this issue and improve the performance of existing
meta-learners in the low-overlap regions. Specifically, we introduce
Overlap-Adaptive Regularization (OAR) that regularizes target models
proportionally to overlap weights so that, informally, the regularization is
higher in regions with low overlap. To the best of our knowledge, our OAR is
the first approach to leverage overlap weights in the regularization terms of
the meta-learners. Our OAR approach is flexible and works with any existing
CATE meta-learner: we demonstrate how OAR can be applied to both parametric and
non-parametric second-stage models. Furthermore, we propose debiased versions
of our OAR that preserve the Neyman-orthogonality of existing meta-learners and
thus ensure more robust inference. Through a series of (semi-)synthetic
experiments, we demonstrate that our OAR significantly improves CATE estimation
in low-overlap settings in comparison to constant regularization.

Motivation: 数据稀缺推动了对更高效样本利用的大型语言模型的需求，需要比较不同模型的样本效率

Method: 利用双下降现象全面比较离散扩散模型和自回归模型的样本效率，分析不同参数化状态下的表现

Result: 离散扩散模型需要更大容量和更多训练轮次才能达到插值阈值；在强过参数化状态下，两种模型表现相似，都没有明显的测试损失二次下降

Conclusion: 自回归模型在小规模数据集上更样本高效，离散扩散模型只有在获得足够容量和计算时才具有竞争力

Abstract: Data scarcity drives the need for more sample-efficient large language
models. In this work, we use the double descent phenomenon to holistically
compare the sample efficiency of discrete diffusion and autoregressive models.
We show that discrete diffusion models require larger capacity and more
training epochs to escape their underparameterized regime and reach the
interpolation threshold. In the strongly overparameterized regime, both models
exhibit similar behavior, with neither exhibiting a pronounced second descent
in test loss across a large range of model sizes. Overall, our results indicate
that autoregressive models are more sample-efficient on small-scale datasets,
while discrete diffusion models only become competitive when given sufficient
capacity and compute.

TL;DR: RLVR是一种改进大语言模型推理能力的方法，但现有方法存在训练不稳定和多样性崩溃问题。本文提出ROVER算法，通过固定均匀随机策略的Q函数恢复最优动作，绕过了复杂的策略迭代循环。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于PPO和GRPO的RLVR方法虽然有效，但存在训练不稳定、多样性崩溃问题，需要复杂的启发式技巧和精细调参。作者发现数学推理中的RLVR可以形式化为特殊的有限时域MDP，其结构比通用控制设置更简单。

Method: 提出ROVER算法，证明可以从固定均匀随机策略的Q函数恢复最优动作。该方法在均匀策略Q值上使用softmax采样动作，避免了复杂的策略迭代循环。

Result: 在多个基础模型和标准数学推理基准测试中，ROVER在质量（pass@1 +8.2，pass@256 +16.8）和多样性（+17.6%）方面都表现出优越性能。

Conclusion: ROVER是一种极简但高效的RL方法，能够在训练过程中保持多样性，持续探索多个有效路径，尽管相比现有复杂方法进行了根本性简化，但性能更优。

Abstract: RL with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a promising paradigm for
improving the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). Current
methods rely primarily on policy optimization frameworks like PPO and GRPO,
which follow generalized policy iteration that alternates between evaluating
the current policy's value and improving the policy based on evaluation. While
effective, they often suffer from training instability and diversity collapse,
requiring complex heuristic tricks and careful tuning. We observe that standard
RLVR in math reasoning can be formalized as a specialized finite-horizon Markov
Decision Process with deterministic state transitions, tree-structured
dynamics, and binary terminal rewards. Though large in scale, the underlying
structure is simpler than general-purpose control settings for which popular RL
algorithms (e.g., PPO) were developed, suggesting that several sophisticated
techniques in existing methods may be reduced or even omitted. Based on this
insight, we prove a surprising result: the optimal action can be recovered from
the Q-function of a fixed uniformly random policy, thereby bypassing the
generalized policy iteration loop and its associated heuristics. We introduce
Random Policy Valuation for Diverse Reasoning (ROVER) to translate this
principle into a practical and scalable algorithm for LLM math reasoning, a
minimalist yet highly effective RL method that samples actions from a softmax
over these uniform-policy Q-values. ROVER preserves diversity throughout
training, allowing sustained exploration of multiple valid pathways. Across
multiple base models and standard math reasoning benchmarks, ROVER demonstrates
superior performance in both \textbf{quality} (\textbf{+8.2} on pass@1,
\textbf{+16.8} on pass@256) and \textbf{diversity} (\textbf{+17.6\%}), despite
its radical simplification compared to strong, complicated existing methods.

Conclusion: 该工作为PPO提供了超越有限维假设的更坚实理论基础，阐明了RKHS近端更新与核TD评论家在实现全局策略改进和实际效率方面的适用条件。

Abstract: We revisit Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) from a function-space
perspective. Our analysis decouples policy evaluation and improvement in a
reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS): (i) A kernelized temporal-difference
(TD) critic performs efficient RKHS-gradient updates using only one-step
state-action transition samples; (ii) a KL-regularized, natural-gradient policy
step exponentiates the evaluated action-value, recovering a PPO/TRPO-style
proximal update in continuous state-action spaces. We provide non-asymptotic,
instance-adaptive guarantees whose rates depend on RKHS entropy, unifying
tabular, linear, Sobolev, Gaussian, and Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) regimes,
and we derive a sampling rule for the proximal update that ensures the optimal
$k^{-1/2}$ convergence rate for stochastic optimization. Empirically, the
theory-aligned schedule improves stability and sample efficiency on common
control tasks (e.g., CartPole, Acrobot), while our TD-based critic attains
favorable throughput versus a GAE baseline. Altogether, our results place PPO
on a firmer theoretical footing beyond finite-dimensional assumptions and
clarify when RKHS-proximal updates with kernel-TD critics yield global policy
improvement with practical efficiency.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了SimA，一种针对扩散模型的单查询成员推理攻击方法，通过分析预测噪声向量的范数来检测训练样本成员身份，发现潜在扩散模型比像素空间模型更安全。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型的成员推理攻击已成为紧迫的隐私问题，现有方法需要多次查询效率低下，需要开发更高效的单查询攻击方法。

Method: 基于理论分析发现去噪器输出指向训练样本的局部均值，其范数编码了与训练集的距离。提出SimA单查询攻击，利用预测噪声向量的范数进行成员推理。

Result: SimA在DDPM和LDM等模型上表现一致强劲，发现潜在扩散模型由于强信息瓶颈而比像素空间模型更安全。通过调整β-VAE正则化参数可增强LDM对MIA的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 巩固了基于分数的成员推理攻击理论，指出需要更好地理解VAE反演而不仅仅是扩散过程反演，为潜在扩散模型提供了防御策略。

Abstract: Membership inference attacks (MIAs) against diffusion models have emerged as
a pressing privacy concern, as these models may inadvertently reveal whether a
given sample was part of their training set. We present a theoretical and
empirical study of score-based MIAs, focusing on the predicted noise vectors
that diffusion models learn to approximate. We show that the expected denoiser
output points toward a kernel-weighted local mean of nearby training samples,
such that its norm encodes proximity to the training set and thereby reveals
membership. Building on this observation, we propose SimA, a single-query
attack that provides a principled, efficient alternative to existing
multi-query methods. SimA achieves consistently strong performance across
variants of DDPM, Latent Diffusion Model (LDM). Notably, we find that Latent
Diffusion Models are surprisingly less vulnerable than pixel-space models, due
to the strong information bottleneck imposed by their latent auto-encoder. We
further investigate this by differing the regularization hyperparameters
($\beta$ in $\beta$-VAE) in latent channel and suggest a strategy to make LDM
training more robust to MIA. Our results solidify the theory of score-based
MIAs, while highlighting that Latent Diffusion class of methods requires better
understanding of inversion for VAE, and not simply inversion of the Diffusion
process

TL;DR: 提出了一种不确定性感知的深度学习框架，通过联合建模认知不确定性和偶然不确定性来改进短期野火危险预测，在准确性和可靠性方面均有显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 野火是严重的自然灾害，深度学习在野火预测中显示出潜力，但由于缺乏不确定性量化，其可靠性受到质疑，阻碍了实际应用。

Method: 开发了不确定性感知的深度学习框架，同时捕捉认知不确定性（模型不确定性）和偶然不确定性（数据不确定性），用于短期野火危险预测。

Result: 在次日预测中，最佳模型相比确定性基线F1分数提升2.3%，预期校准误差降低2.1%。不确定性估计可靠，可用于决策支持，包括识别不确定性阈值和生成带有不确定性层的校准野火危险地图。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提高了野火危险预测的准确性和可靠性，推进了可信赖野火深度学习系统的发展，两种不确定性类型在挑战性条件下提供互补见解。

Abstract: Wildfires are among the most severe natural hazards, posing a significant
threat to both humans and natural ecosystems. The growing risk of wildfires
increases the demand for forecasting models that are not only accurate but also
reliable. Deep Learning (DL) has shown promise in predicting wildfire danger;
however, its adoption is hindered by concerns over the reliability of its
predictions, some of which stem from the lack of uncertainty quantification. To
address this challenge, we present an uncertainty-aware DL framework that
jointly captures epistemic (model) and aleatoric (data) uncertainty to enhance
short-term wildfire danger forecasting. In the next-day forecasting, our
best-performing model improves the F1 Score by 2.3% and reduces the Expected
Calibration Error by 2.1% compared to a deterministic baseline, enhancing both
predictive skill and calibration. Our experiments confirm the reliability of
the uncertainty estimates and illustrate their practical utility for decision
support, including the identification of uncertainty thresholds for rejecting
low-confidence predictions and the generation of well-calibrated wildfire
danger maps with accompanying uncertainty layers. Extending the forecast
horizon up to ten days, we observe that aleatoric uncertainty increases with
time, showing greater variability in environmental conditions, while epistemic
uncertainty remains stable. Finally, we show that although the two uncertainty
types may be redundant in low-uncertainty cases, they provide complementary
insights under more challenging conditions, underscoring the value of their
joint modeling for robust wildfire danger prediction. In summary, our approach
significantly improves the accuracy and reliability of wildfire danger
forecasting, advancing the development of trustworthy wildfire DL systems.

*Jiayu Liu,Zhenya Huang,Anya Sims,Enhong Chen,Yee Whye Teh,Ning Miao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MARCOS提出了一种新的LLM推理范式，将推理建模为连续高维思想的隐马尔可夫链，替代传统的token级链式思维，实现了更高效、更灵活的推理过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统链式思维推理存在三个主要问题：推理速度慢且计算成本高、受限于离散token空间、推理与token生成耦合导致短视推理。MARCOS旨在解决这些局限性。

Method: 将推理建模为连续高维思想的隐马尔可夫链，每个推理步骤对应内部思想的转换，显式推理步骤作为可观测变量。采用两阶段变分训练方案来解决潜在过程与监督学习不兼容的问题。

Result: 在三个基准测试中，MARCOS超越了现有连续推理方法，首次达到与token级链式思维相当的性能，在GSM8K上甚至超出4.7%，推理速度提升高达15.7倍。

Conclusion: MARCOS不仅实现了高效推理，还提供了步骤级而非token级的随机性控制，为强化学习和LLM推理开辟了重要机会。

Abstract: The current paradigm for reasoning in large language models (LLMs) involves
models "thinking out loud" via a sequence of tokens, known as chain-of-thought
(CoT). This approach, while effective, has several significant drawbacks.
Firstly, inference requires autoregressive generation of often thousands of CoT
tokens, which is slow and computationally expensive. Secondly, it constrains
reasoning to the discrete space of tokens, creating an information bottleneck
across reasoning steps. Thirdly, it fundamentally entangles reasoning with
token generation, forcing LLMs to "think while speaking," which causes
potentially short-sighted reasoning. In light of these limitations, we
re-imagine reasoning in LLMs and present a new paradigm: MARCOS. In our
approach, rather than autoregressively generating tokens, we model reasoning as
a hidden Markov chain of continuous, high-dimensional "thoughts". Each
reasoning step involves a transition of the internal thoughts, where explicit
reasoning steps (which may consist of hundreds of tokens) serve as observable
variables, which are windows to peek into the implicit thoughts. Since this
latent process is incompatible with the standard supervised learning, we
further propose a two-phase variational training scheme. Our experiments on
three benchmarks demonstrate that MARCOS outperforms existing continuous
reasoning methods and, for the first time, achieves performance comparable to
token-based CoT, even surpassing it by 4.7% on GSM8K with up to 15.7x speedup
in inference. Beyond this, MARCOS offers additional advantages, such as
step-level instead of token-level control over randomness, opening significant
opportunities for reinforcement learning and reasoning in LLMs.

Result: 模型能够准确高效地估计高保真结构分析结果，提供经过校准的认知不确定性，在铁路下穿通道的实际案例中证明有效性。

Conclusion: 该框架具有显著降低成本和排放的潜力，通过避免不必要的分析和物理干预来优化整个基础设施组合的管理。

Abstract: Aging infrastructure portfolios pose a critical resource allocation
challenge: deciding which structures require intervention and which can safely
remain in service. Structural assessments must balance the trade-off between
cheaper, conservative analysis methods and accurate but costly simulations that
do not scale portfolio-wide. We propose Bayesian neural network (BNN)
surrogates for rapid structural pre-assessment of worldwide common bridge
types, such as reinforced concrete frame bridges. Trained on a large-scale
database of non-linear finite element analyses generated via a parametric
pipeline and developed based on the Swiss Federal Railway's bridge portfolio,
the models accurately and efficiently estimate high-fidelity structural
analysis results by predicting code compliance factors with calibrated
epistemic uncertainty. Our BNN surrogate enables fast, uncertainty-aware
triage: flagging likely critical structures and providing guidance where
refined analysis is pertinent. We demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in
a real-world case study of a railway underpass, showing its potential to
significantly reduce costs and emissions by avoiding unnecessary analyses and
physical interventions across entire infrastructure portfolios.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文通过将编码器transformer模型中的token建模为平均场相互作用粒子系统，研究其在推理时随网络深度的演化动态，特别关注中等相互作用机制下的多尺度行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究transformer模型中token在推理过程中随网络深度的演化规律，理解其动态行为特征，特别是中等相互作用机制下的多尺度现象。

Method: 将token建模为平均场相互作用粒子系统，在中等相互作用机制下（token数量N大，逆温度参数β与N同尺度）分析系统动态，包括快速相、中间相和慢速相的多尺度行为。

Result: 系统动态呈现多尺度行为：快速相中token经验测度坍缩到低维空间，中间相进一步坍缩为聚类，慢速相中聚类依次合并为单一聚类。通过模拟验证了理论结果。

Conclusion: 在中等相互作用机制下，transformer模型中的token演化呈现明确的多尺度动态特征，为理解模型内部工作机制提供了理论框架。

Abstract: In this paper, we study the evolution of tokens through the depth of
encoder-only transformer models at inference time by modeling them as a system
of particles interacting in a mean-field way and studying the corresponding
dynamics. More specifically, we consider this problem in the moderate
interaction regime, where the number $N$ of tokens is large and the inverse
temperature parameter $\beta$ of the model scales together with $N$. In this
regime, the dynamics of the system displays a multiscale behavior: a fast
phase, where the token empirical measure collapses on a low-dimensional space,
an intermediate phase, where the measure further collapses into clusters, and a
slow one, where such clusters sequentially merge into a single one. We provide
a rigorous characterization of the limiting dynamics in each of these phases
and prove convergence in the above mentioned limit, exemplifying our results
with some simulations.

Motivation: 随着超参数调优成本增加，需要建立指导原则来提升效率。现有调优原则有限，需要探索更有效的方法。

Conclusion: 工作提出了新的高效调优原则，改进了现有缩放定律，挑战了多个现有观点，为缩放定律研究提供新启发。

Abstract: As hyperparameter tuning becomes increasingly costly at scale, efficient
tuning methods are essential. Yet principles for guiding hyperparameter tuning
remain limited. In this work, we seek to establish such principles by
considering a broad range of hyperparameters, including batch size, learning
rate, and weight decay. We identify a phenomenon we call trajectory invariance,
where pre-training loss curves, gradient noise, and gradient norm exhibit
invariance--closely overlapping--with respect to a quantity that combines
learning rate and weight decay. This phenomenon effectively reduces the
original two-dimensional hyperparameter space to one dimension, yielding an
efficient tuning rule: follow the salient direction revealed by trajectory
invariance. Furthermore, we refine previous scaling laws and challenge several
existing viewpoints. Overall, our work proposes new principles for efficient
tuning and inspires future research on scaling laws.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Advantage Weighted Matching (AWM)方法，通过使用与预训练相同的score/flow匹配损失来降低方差，并通过优势权重重新加权样本，在扩散模型的强化学习中实现更快的收敛。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型强化学习方法（如DDPO）使用与预训练不同的目标函数，导致方差增加和收敛缓慢。本文旨在统一预训练和强化学习的目标函数。

Method: AWM使用与预训练相同的score/flow匹配损失，并通过优势权重重新加权样本，提升高奖励样本的影响，抑制低奖励样本的影响。

Result: 在GenEval、OCR和PickScore基准测试中，AWM相比Flow-GRPO实现了高达24倍的加速，应用于Stable Diffusion 3.5 Medium和FLUX模型，且不损害生成质量。

Conclusion: AWM方法在概念和实践上统一了预训练和强化学习，降低了方差，实现了更快的收敛速度，在多个基准测试中表现出显著优势。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a central paradigm for advancing
Large Language Models (LLMs), where pre-training and RL post-training share the
same log-likelihood formulation. In contrast, recent RL approaches for
diffusion models, most notably Denoising Diffusion Policy Optimization (DDPO),
optimize an objective different from the pretraining objectives--score/flow
matching loss. In this work, we establish a novel theoretical analysis: DDPO is
an implicit form of score/flow matching with noisy targets, which increases
variance and slows convergence. Building on this analysis, we introduce
\textbf{Advantage Weighted Matching (AWM)}, a policy-gradient method for
diffusion. It uses the same score/flow-matching loss as pretraining to obtain a
lower-variance objective and reweights each sample by its advantage. In effect,
AWM raises the influence of high-reward samples and suppresses low-reward ones
while keeping the modeling objective identical to pretraining. This unifies
pretraining and RL conceptually and practically, is consistent with
policy-gradient theory, reduces variance, and yields faster convergence. This
simple yet effective design yields substantial benefits: on GenEval, OCR, and
PickScore benchmarks, AWM delivers up to a $24\times$ speedup over Flow-GRPO
(which builds on DDPO), when applied to Stable Diffusion 3.5 Medium and FLUX,
without compromising generation quality. Code is available at

Abstract: Data-driven models are increasingly adopted in critical scientific fields
like weather forecasting and fluid dynamics. These methods can fail on
out-of-distribution (OOD) data, but detecting such failures in regression tasks
is an open challenge. We propose a new OOD detection method based on estimating
joint likelihoods using a score-based diffusion model. This approach considers
not just the input but also the regression model's prediction, providing a
task-aware reliability score. Across numerous scientific datasets, including
PDE datasets, satellite imagery and brain tumor segmentation, we show that this
likelihood strongly correlates with prediction error. Our work provides a
foundational step towards building a verifiable 'certificate of trust', thereby
offering a practical tool for assessing the trustworthiness of AI-based
scientific predictions. Our code is publicly available at

Motivation: 探索在实用扩展配方下训练的LLM家族是否也存在损失曲线归一化现象，以及这种现象在计算效率训练中的意义。

Method: 通过分析不同规模LLM的训练损失曲线，研究在宽度、深度、学习率、批量大小和权重衰减联合扩展时，损失曲线是否能够归一化到统一轨迹。

Result: 发现当优化超参数根据数据预算最优设置时，损失曲线确实能够精确归一化，collapse现象成为计算效率训练的特征。

Conclusion: collapse现象可作为训练病理的早期诊断工具，并为大规模超参数调优提供早期停止策略，是开发高效LLM的有效工具。

Abstract: Effective LLM training relies on *consistency*, meaning that key quantities
-- such as final losses and optimal hyperparameters -- scale predictably across
model sizes. Qiu et al. (2025) recently showed that this consistency extends
beyond scalars: whole training loss curves can *collapse* onto a universal
trajectory after a simple normalization. What remains unclear is whether this
phenomenon holds for LLM families trained under *practical scaling recipes*,
where width, depth, learning rate, batch size, and weight decay are scaled
jointly. We show that it does: loss curves collapse across scales precisely
when optimization hyperparameters are set optimally for the given data budget,
in accordance with recent empirical scaling laws. Collapse thus emerges as a
signature of compute-efficient training. We demonstrate two applications at
scale: (1) deviation-from-collapse provides a sensitive, early diagnostic of
training pathologies, and (2) the predictability of collapsed curves enables
early stopping in large-scale hyperparameter tuning. Finally, we train a
competitive LLM family, *Celerity*, using these insights, highlighting collapse
as an effective tool for developing efficient LLMs.

Unlike standard CoT distillation, the approach transfers knowledge through

Abstract: X-ray ptychography is a data-intensive imaging technique expected to become
ubiquitous at next-generation light sources delivering many-fold increases in
coherent flux. The need for real-time feedback under accelerated acquisition
rates motivates surrogate reconstruction models like deep neural networks,
which offer orders-of-magnitude speedup over conventional methods. However,
existing deep learning approaches lack robustness across diverse experimental
conditions. We propose an unsupervised training workflow emphasizing probe
learning by combining experimentally-measured probes with synthetic,
procedurally generated objects. This probe-centric approach enables a single
physics-informed neural network to reconstruct unseen experiments across
multiple beamlines; among the first demonstrations of multi-probe
generalization. We find probe learning is equally important as in-distribution
learning; models trained using this synthetic workflow achieve reconstruction
fidelity comparable to those trained exclusively on experimental data, even
when changing the type of synthetic training object. The proposed approach
enables training of experiment-steering models that provide real-time feedback
under dynamic experimental conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统熵正则化方法在大推理模型(LRM)中失效，因为巨大的动作空间和长轨迹会导致全局熵爆炸，需要限制探索到有意义的子集

Method: SIREN采用两步熵掩码机制：top-p掩码和峰值熵掩码，将正则化转换为自锚定形式以稳定训练

Result: 在五个数学基准测试中，SIREN优于之前的熵相关RLVR方法，在AIME24/25上获得+6.6 maj@k提升，促进响应多样性并保持适当熵水平

Conclusion: SIREN有效缓解了RLVR在LRM中的过早收敛问题，保持验证pass@k在整个训练过程中的稳定性

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has shown great promise
in enhancing the reasoning abilities of large reasoning models (LRMs). However,
it suffers from a critical issue: entropy collapse and premature convergence.
Naive entropy regularization, a common approach for encouraging exploration in
the traditional RL literature, fails to address this problem in the context of
LRM. Our analysis reveals that this failure stems from the vast action space
and long trajectories in LRMs, which easily trigger a global entropy explosion
as the model indiscriminately explores all possible actions and states. To
address this, we propose SIREN (SelectIve entRopy rEgularizatioN), a method
that confines exploration to a meaningful subset of actions and states. SIREN
achieves this through a two-step entropy masking mechanism, consisting of a
top-p mask and a peak-entropy mask. In addition, regularization is transformed
into a self-anchored form to stabilize training. Across five mathematical
benchmarks, SIREN attains superior average performance over previous
entropy-related RLVR approaches, exemplified by a +6.6 maj@k improvement on
AIME24/25 with Qwen2.5-Math-7B. Further analysis confirms that SIREN promotes
greater response diversity and maintains entropy at an appropriate level, which
helps to preserve the validation pass@k throughout training. This effectively
mitigates the premature convergence problem common in RLVR for LRM.

TL;DR: 本文提出了在线学习中的重放设置框架，研究机器学习系统在自我标注数据上训练时如何避免错误强化。通过引入扩展阈值维度作为精确的可学习性度量，证明了基于闭包的算法在该设置下的最优性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器学习系统越来越多地在自我标注数据上训练，它们面临强化错误和形成自我信念回音室的风险。本文旨在建模和分析这种现象，为理解在这种设置下的学习能力提供理论基础。

Method: 引入在线学习重放设置框架：在每一轮中，学习者输出假设，对手揭示真实标签或早期轮次的重放标签。提出扩展阈值维度作为可学习性度量，并设计基于闭包的学习算法。

Result: 证明了扩展阈值维度是该模型下精确的可学习性度量：基于闭包的学习者最多犯扩展阈值维度个错误，且没有算法能做得更好。对于随机对手，证明了类似边界。重放设置比经典错误边界设置更难学习。

Conclusion: 重放设置下的学习能力由扩展阈值维度精确刻画。适当学习仅对（几乎）交闭类可行，否则每个适当学习者都会遭受线性错误，而我们的非适当算法仍能达到扩展阈值维度边界。

Abstract: As machine learning systems increasingly train on self-annotated data, they
risk reinforcing errors and becoming echo chambers of their own beliefs. We
model this phenomenon by introducing a learning-theoretic framework: Online
Learning in the Replay Setting. In round $t$, the learner outputs a hypothesis
$\hat{h}_t$; the adversary then reveals either the true label $f^\ast(x_t)$ or
a replayed label $\hat{h}_i(x_t)$ from an earlier round $i < t$. A mistake is
counted only when the true label is shown, yet classical algorithms such as the
SOA or the halving algorithm are easily misled by the replayed errors.
  We introduce the Extended Threshold dimension, $\mathrm{ExThD}(\mathcal{H})$,
and prove matching upper and lower bounds that make
$\mathrm{ExThD}(\mathcal{H})$ the exact measure of learnability in this model.
A closure-based learner makes at most $\mathrm{ExThD}(\mathcal{H})$ mistakes
against any adaptive adversary, and no algorithm can perform better. For
stochastic adversaries, we prove a similar bound for every intersection-closed
class. The replay setting is provably harder than the classical mistake bound
setting: some classes have constant Littlestone dimension but arbitrarily large
$\mathrm{ExThD}(\mathcal{H})$. Proper learning exhibits an even sharper
separation: a class is properly learnable under replay if and only if it is
(almost) intersection-closed. Otherwise, every proper learner suffers
$\Omega(T)$ errors, whereas our improper algorithm still achieves the
$\mathrm{ExThD}(\mathcal{H})$ bound. These results give the first tight
analysis of learning against replay adversaries, based on new results for

*David González Martínez*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BALF是一个无需微调的神经网络压缩框架，通过激活感知分解和可扩展的预算秩分配器，在多种模型上实现高效压缩。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统神经网络压缩方法需要昂贵的微调或搜索过程，在普通硬件上不实用，需要一种无需微调的高效压缩方案。

Method: 采用激活感知分解框架和可扩展的预算秩分配器，允许灵活控制压缩目标（如保留50%参数）且无额外开销。

Result: 在ResNet-20、ResNeXt-101和视觉变换器上验证有效，ResNeXt-101的FLOPs减少45%而top-1准确率仅下降1个百分点。

Conclusion: BALF在无需微调的情况下实现了优秀的压缩效果，适用于多种模型架构和规模。

Abstract: Neural network compression techniques typically require expensive fine-tuning
or search procedures, rendering them impractical on commodity hardware.
Inspired by recent LLM compression research, we present a general
activation-aware factorization framework that can be applied to a broad range
of layers. Moreover, we introduce a scalable budgeted rank allocator that
allows flexible control over compression targets (e.g., retaining 50% of
parameters) with no overhead. Together, these components form BALF, an
efficient pipeline for compressing models without fine-tuning. We demonstrate
its effectiveness across multiple scales and architectures, from ResNet-20 on
CIFAR-10 to ResNeXt-101 and vision transformers on ImageNet, and show that it
achieves excellent results in the fine-tuning-free regime. For instance, BALF
reduces FLOPs on ResNeXt-101 by 45% with only a 1-percentage-point top-1
accuracy drop.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文从理论上分析了注意力机制如何学习选择性地关注信息丰富的token，以检测弱、罕见且稀疏分布的特征。研究表明注意力分类器在长序列限制下只需对数级信号强度就能实现零测试误差，优于需要平方根级信号强度的线性分类器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究注意力机制何时以及如何学习选择性地关注信息丰富的token，从而能够检测弱、罕见且稀疏分布的特征。

Method: 在稀疏token分类模型中，正样本在随机选择的token子集中嵌入弱信号向量，负样本为纯噪声。研究在长序列限制和高维状态下的训练过程，分析梯度更新对查询权重向量的影响。

Result: 证明注意力分类器在信号强度仅需对数级增长时就能实现零测试误差，而线性分类器需要平方根级增长。仅需两次梯度更新就能使查询权重向量与隐藏信号产生非平凡对齐，产生选择性放大信息token的注意力图。

Conclusion: 注意力机制通过自适应token选择在检测弱稀疏特征方面具有明显优势，其容量（可完美分离的最大数据集大小）优于非自适应线性基线方法。

Abstract: When and how can an attention mechanism learn to selectively attend to
informative tokens, thereby enabling detection of weak, rare, and sparsely
located features? We address these questions theoretically in a sparse-token
classification model in which positive samples embed a weak signal vector in a
randomly chosen subset of tokens, whereas negative samples are pure noise. In
the long-sequence limit, we show that a simple single-layer attention
classifier can in principle achieve vanishing test error when the signal
strength grows only logarithmically in the sequence length $L$, whereas linear
classifiers require $\sqrt{L}$ scaling. Moving from representational power to
learnability, we study training at finite $L$ in a high-dimensional regime,
where sample size and embedding dimension grow proportionally. We prove that
just two gradient updates suffice for the query weight vector of the attention
classifier to acquire a nontrivial alignment with the hidden signal, inducing
an attention map that selectively amplifies informative tokens. We further
derive an exact asymptotic expression for the test error and training loss of
the trained attention-based classifier, and quantify its capacity -- the
largest dataset size that is typically perfectly separable -- thereby
explaining the advantage of adaptive token selection over nonadaptive linear
baselines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练的方法CCFM，通过将随机优化集成到采样过程中，有效强制执行硬约束同时保持高保真样本生成，在复杂物理系统和分子对接问题上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成模型虽然能合成高质量样本，但经常违反物理定律或任务规范产生的硬约束。现有投影方法会扭曲学习分布，而多阶段方法增加了算法复杂性并累积误差。

Method: CCFM方法将随机优化集成到采样过程中，在噪声中间样本上操作，但理论上等同于在干净样本上投影到可行集，从而减轻分布扭曲。

Result: 实验表明CCFM在建模偏微分方程控制的复杂物理系统和分子对接问题上，比当前最先进的约束生成模型表现更好，提供更高的可行性和保真度。

Conclusion: CCFM方法能够在保证样本可行性的同时维持高保真度，为约束生成建模提供了一种有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Generative models excel at synthesizing high-fidelity samples from complex
data distributions, but they often violate hard constraints arising from
physical laws or task specifications. A common remedy is to project
intermediate samples onto the feasible set; however, repeated projection can
distort the learned distribution and induce a mismatch with the data manifold.
Thus, recent multi-stage procedures attempt to defer projection to clean
samples during sampling, but they increase algorithmic complexity and
accumulate errors across steps. This paper addresses these challenges by
proposing a novel training-free method, Chance-constrained Flow Matching
(CCFM), that integrates stochastic optimization into the sampling process,
enabling effective enforcement of hard constraints while maintaining
high-fidelity sample generation. Importantly, CCFM guarantees feasibility in
the same manner as conventional repeated projection, yet, despite operating
directly on noisy intermediate samples, it is theoretically equivalent to
projecting onto the feasible set defined by clean samples. This yields a
sampler that mitigates distributional distortion. Empirical experiments show
that CCFM outperforms current state-of-the-art constrained generative models in
modeling complex physical systems governed by partial differential equations
and molecular docking problems, delivering higher feasibility and fidelity.

Conclusion: 该研究为现代配电网中可靠高效的电压预测提供了实用的模型选择指导。

Abstract: Voltage prediction in distribution grids is a critical yet difficult task for
maintaining power system stability. Machine learning approaches, particularly
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), offer significant speedups but suffer from poor
generalization when trained on limited or incomplete data. In this work, we
systematically investigate the role of inductive biases in improving a model's
ability to reliably learn power flow. Specifically, we evaluate three
physics-informed strategies: (i) power-flow-constrained loss functions, (ii)
complex-valued neural networks, and (iii) residual-based task reformulation.
Using the ENGAGE dataset, which spans multiple low- and medium-voltage grid
configurations, we conduct controlled experiments to isolate the effect of each
inductive bias and assess both standard predictive performance and
out-of-distribution generalization. Our study provides practical insights into
which model assumptions most effectively guide learning for reliable and
efficient voltage prediction in modern distribution networks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GLASS Flows提出了一种新的采样范式，通过模拟"流匹配模型中的流匹配模型"来采样马尔可夫转移，将ODE的效率与SDE的随机演化相结合，无需重新训练即可提升流匹配和扩散模型的推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的奖励对齐算法在推理时依赖SDE采样，效率较低且性能往往不如ODE采样，这成为性能提升的主要瓶颈。

Method: 引入GLASS Flows采样范式，从预训练模型中提取"内部"流匹配模型来模拟马尔可夫转移，结合Feynman-Kac Steering方法。

Result: 在大规模文生图模型中，GLASS Flows消除了随机演化与效率之间的权衡，实现了最先进的文本到图像生成性能。

Conclusion: GLASS Flows为流和扩散模型的推理时扩展提供了一个简单、即插即用的解决方案。

Abstract: The performance of flow matching and diffusion models can be greatly improved
at inference time using reward alignment algorithms, yet efficiency remains a
major limitation. While several algorithms were proposed, we demonstrate that a
common bottleneck is the sampling method these algorithms rely on: many
algorithms require to sample Markov transitions via SDE sampling, which is
significantly less efficient and often less performant than ODE sampling. To
remove this bottleneck, we introduce GLASS Flows, a new sampling paradigm that
simulates a "flow matching model within a flow matching model" to sample Markov
transitions. As we show in this work, this "inner" flow matching model can be
retrieved from a pre-trained model without any re-training, combining the
efficiency of ODEs with the stochastic evolution of SDEs. On large-scale
text-to-image models, we show that GLASS Flows eliminate the trade-off between
stochastic evolution and efficiency. Combined with Feynman-Kac Steering, GLASS
Flows improve state-of-the-art performance in text-to-image generation, making
it a simple, drop-in solution for inference-time scaling of flow and diffusion
models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于随机最优控制的扩散模型微调方法容易强化次优轨迹，导致奖励效果不佳，需要克服这一挑战。

Conclusion: TR2-D2为离散序列生成中的奖励引导微调提供了可靠且有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with stochastic optimal control offers a promising
framework for diffusion fine-tuning, where a pre-trained diffusion model is
optimized to generate paths that lead to a reward-tilted distribution. While
these approaches enable optimization without access to explicit samples from
the optimal distribution, they require training on rollouts under the current
fine-tuned model, making them susceptible to reinforcing sub-optimal
trajectories that yield poor rewards. To overcome this challenge, we introduce
TRee Search Guided TRajectory-Aware Fine-Tuning for Discrete Diffusion
(TR2-D2), a novel framework that optimizes reward-guided discrete diffusion
trajectories with tree search to construct replay buffers for trajectory-aware
fine-tuning. These buffers are generated using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)
and subsequently used to fine-tune a pre-trained discrete diffusion model under
a stochastic optimal control objective. We validate our framework on single-
and multi-objective fine-tuning of biological sequence diffusion models,
highlighting the overall effectiveness of TR2-D2 for reliable reward-guided
fine-tuning in discrete sequence generation.

Abstract: Sample efficiency is a central property of effective deep reinforcement
learning algorithms. Recent work has improved this through added complexity,
such as larger models, exotic network architectures, and more complex
algorithms, which are typically motivated purely by empirical performance. We
take a more principled approach by focusing on the optimization landscape of
the critic network. Using the eigenspectrum and condition number of the
critic's Hessian, we systematically investigate the impact of common
architectural design decisions on training dynamics. Our analysis reveals that
a novel combination of batch normalization (BN), weight normalization (WN), and
a distributional cross-entropy (CE) loss produces condition numbers orders of
magnitude smaller than baselines. This combination also naturally bounds
gradient norms, a property critical for maintaining a stable effective learning
rate under non-stationary targets and bootstrapping. Based on these insights,
we introduce XQC: a well-motivated, sample-efficient deep actor-critic
algorithm built upon soft actor-critic that embodies these optimization-aware
principles. We achieve state-of-the-art sample efficiency across 55
proprioception and 15 vision-based continuous control tasks, all while using
significantly fewer parameters than competing methods.

TL;DR: SIRI是一种通过交替压缩和扩展推理预算来训练大型推理模型的方法，能够在提高性能的同时减少推理长度和计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型推理模型存在重复思维模式，减少这些重复往往以性能下降为代价。本文旨在克服这种权衡。

Method: 采用迭代训练机制，在压缩阶段限制推理长度迫使模型做出精确决策，在扩展阶段放宽长度限制让模型探索长视野推理。

Conclusion: 通过在训练中周期性调整输出截断长度，可以动态平衡推理的探索性和效率，收敛到性能与效率的最优平衡点。

Abstract: We introduce SIRI, Scaling Iterative Reinforcement Learning with Interleaved
Compression, a simple yet effective RL approach for Large Reasoning Models
(LRMs) that enables more efficient and accurate reasoning. Existing studies
have observed repetitive thinking patterns in LRMs, and attempts to reduce them
often come at the cost of performance. In this paper, we show that this
trade-off can be overcome through a training regime that iteratively alternates
between compressing and expanding the reasoning budget, by dynamically
adjusting the maximum rollout length during training. The compression phase
cuts the rollout length, forcing the model to make precise and valuable
decisions within a limited context, which effectively reduces redundant tokens
and increases reasoning density. The expansion phase then relaxes the length
limit, providing space for the model to explore and plan in long-horizon
settings. Remarkably, we find that after each compression-expansion cycle, the
model's performance improves even as its output length decreases, steadily
pushing it closer to the Pareto frontier in the performance-efficiency
trade-off. Training on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, SIRI-low improves
performance on AIME24 by 43.2% while reducing token usage by 46.9% after three
iterations, and SIRI-high achieves the highest accuracy compared to all other
methods (Figure 1). Our findings shed light on the potential of periodically
oscillating the LRM's output truncation length during training to dynamically
balance exploration and efficiency in reasoning, converging towards an optimal
"sweet spot" between the two. Our models are publicly available.
